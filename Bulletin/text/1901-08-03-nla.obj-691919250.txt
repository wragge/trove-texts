THE RED RAGE.
“Convict Once and Other Poems.”
11.
WE have seen (May 11) that “ Convict
Once,” by J. Brunton Stephens, is
rather the work of a sentimental
Pedagogue than of a Poet. Apart
from its dramatic failure, apart from its flaws of
rhythm and rhyfne, of style and phrase, it is
essentially a stiff, scholastic performance. It
contains many fine lines, even verses, but their
quality is less, poetical than eloquent, sonorous.
Vital emotion is absent, and the thought is undis-
tinguished. The beauty of the best passages is
chiefly beauty of intellectual ingenuity, dependent
upon language rounded by a recitative pen. Con-
sider these, for example:
Linger, oh Sun, for a little, nor close yet this day of a
million ! '
Is there not glory enough in the rose-curtained halls of
the west ?
Hast thou no joy in the passion-hued folds of thy kingly
pavilion ?
Why shouldst thou only pass through it 1 Oh rest thee a
little while, rest!
Why should the Njght come and take it, the (wan Night
that cannot enjoy it,
Bringing pale argent for golden, and changing vermilion
to grey ?
Why should the Night come and shadow it, entering hut
to destroy it ?
Rest ’mid thy ruby-trailed splendours ! Oh stay thee a
little while, stay 1
Rest thee at least a brief hour in it l Tis a right royal
pavilion.
Lo, there are thrones for high dalliance all gloriously
canopied o’er 1
Lo, there are hangings of purple, and hangings of blue
and vermiKon,
And there are fleeces of gold for thy feet on the diapered
floor ! v
Linger, a little while linger. To-morrow thy heart may not
sing to thee!
This shall be yesterday, numbered with memories, folded
away.
Now, should my flesh-fettered soul be set free ! I would
soar to thee, cling to thee,
And be thy rereward Aurora, pursuing the skirts of to-
day !
This is agreeable rhetoric, not flawless ; but the
poetical emotion is slight, and is made slighter by
the rhetoric. The fact is that “Convict Once”
is set in a rhetorician’s metre, well fitted for the
display of “stunning words,” but not well fitted
for the expression of poetical emotion. Even
when a better hexameter is better handled, as in
William Watson’s “ Hymn to the Sea,” it leaves
an impression of the exotic, the artificial; and,
though some of Brunton Stephens’s stanzas are
admirable, they end by becoming monotonous.
Take another example of the piece at its best —
Die then, sad memories, leaving behind you no token nor
relic !
Hark how the tremulous night-wind is passing in joy-laden
sighs.
Soft through my window it comes like the fanning of
pinions angelic,
Whispering to cease from myself, and look out on the in-
finite skies.
Out on the orb-studded night, and the crescent effulgence
of Dian ;
Out on the far-gleaming star-dust that marks where the
angels have trod ;
Out on the gem-pointed cross, and the glittering pomp of
Orion,
Flaming in measureless azure, the coronal jewels of
God ...
Oh, summer-night of the South! Oh, sweet languor of
zephyrs love-sighing !
Oh, mighty circuit of shadowy solitude, holy and still 1
Music scarce audible, echoless harmony joyously dying,
Dying in faint suspirations o’er meadow, and forest, and
hill !
Here there is a little more poetical exaltation;
the writer disengages a little more emotion ; but
the verse is still essentially rhetorical —less the
work of a Poet than that of a Pedagogue “in-
toxicated with the exuberance of his own ver-
bosity.” On the low poetical plane, it is admirable,
commendable; on the high plane, it does not
exist. Occasionally we get the rhetoric, and the
slight emotion, and greater strength of idea—
This is not life, to be bowed in the heart-hush of worship
for ever,
Softly asleep on my shadow to glide o'er a summer-lit
sea.
Life is not passionless calm, but the turbid delight of the
river.
Give me the billowy Jordan ! . . . enough now of blue
Galilee.
Soul cannot march to the bleating of sheep and the low-
ing of cattle.
Rather the war-blast of passion were thrilling again in
mile ears !
Oh for a touch of the palpitant world ! for the glory of
battle !
Show me once more the proud wave of the banners, the
gleam of the spears !
Stanzas like these kernel the best of “ Convict
Once,” and it is chiefly in virtue of these that the
piece remains a considerable performance in Aus-
tralian verse—despite its narrative and dramatic
failure, despite its pedantic stiffness and metrical
monotony.
Brunton Stephens’s, qualifications for poetry are
energy, a little fancy, a little power of thought
npt very new or original—the qualifications of his
Scottish nation. He lacks imagination and
strength of emotion Poetry’s most essential
requisites; he lacks, technically, the finer quali-
ties of Taste ; and the Poet in him is hampered by
the continual obtrusion of the Pedagogue. E.g.
First Claes in Botany stand up (p. 41)—
How I have smiled at my school-bred compatriots lan-
guidly viewing
Ivy-clad relics caducous, and morbidly learned in
decay. . . .
First Class jn Mechanics—What is the meaning
of “centripetal ”?
Even as the shedder of blood ever fleeing the dread scene
of slaughter,
Yet by centripetal charm ever drawn to the spot where
the hand
Points from the shuddering earth. . .
And so on. Instead of emotional fervour, Brun-
ton Stephens gives us intellectual images—that is,
his mental field is essentially in the domain of
Page- references to the Australian edition of “ Convict
Once and Other Poems ’’ (Geo. Robertson, 1S88).
P< r m? e ’ f, 110l 10 ? in the domain of poetry. Even in
-L he Dominion of Australia ” —a good piece, in
spite of stiffness and verbosity—the intellectual,
spholastie metaphor intrudes. After a fine verse,
closing with a fine image—
Already here to hearts intense,
A spirit-force, transcending sense,
In heights unsealed, in deeps unstirred,
Beneath the calm, above the storm,
She waits the incorporating' word
To bid her tremble into form.
Already, like divining-rods, men’s souls
Bend down to where the unseen river rolls ;
Stephens does not rest satisfied until he has
made the image geologically complete by an
accurate reference to artesian water-supply and
its value in drought-time—spoiling his original
impression and overloading his poem. Never in
the realm of Imagination, he is even never wholly
m tlie lower realm of Fancy : he has always one
solid scotch foot on the solid ground of fact,
sometimes he has two : even when his head is in
the clouds he gets rheumatic twinges in his
poetical feet from the earth-damps. Thus in the
verses for “ Adelaide Ironside” he is stiffly ex-
pounding an intellectual thesis. Lines like—
There, too, I led thee to feed thee, with prescience and
keen imitation -
Of the art-adjuvant Grace that hath given thee a love-
gift, to me—
simply schoolmaster’s prose in wooden metre
.hard, pounding, gentlemen,” as Wellington
said at Waterloo. And a sense of humour would
have saved Stephens from this glorification of in-
fantile art, bordering on the ridiculous—
Nothing that came from thy hand, Oh, Love, made void,
cut off, evanescent, —
From the infantile essay that strove with the weapon of
outline alone,
To the Angels thou lovedst to portray with luminous
plumes iridescent,
Till thy soul drew so near unto us that we took thee for
one of our own.
But Brunton Stephens, though witty, has not that
subtle perception of the incongruous which is the
basis of humour. Purely intellectual contrasts
appeal to him always; emotional contrasts, or
intellectual-with-emotional contrasts, rarely or
never. Considered on the intellectual basis, as
clever verse, his work stands high. His verbal
quips are as good as Hood’s ; his verbal ingenuity
as great as Calverley’s, though his rhythms are less
fluid, less flawless than Calverley’s. The punster’s
hand is seen even in “Convict Once,” when he
says of Death (p. 103) —
’Tis but the clasp of the die on the coin, which the mould
must once cover,
Ere it shine forth with the bright superscription and
image of God.
In “New Chum and Old Monarch” the pun is
more fitly placed—
“ Enter, sire ; no longer linger ;
Cease thy signals grandly dumb :
Point not thus with royal finger
To thy hungry vacuum.
“ Though thy pangs are multifarious,
Soon they all shall pass away ;
Come, my begging Belisarius—
Belisorious, I should say.”
Superb; and Brunton Stephens can repeat these
triumphs to our head’s delight. Here is the
predominant Pedagogue at home, scintillat-
ing and splendid. A collection of Brunton
Stephens’s witty verses would well deserve
perpetuity ; and it is by these successes, and
not by his serious, emotional failures, that
he will gain -Whatever perpetuity is allotted
to him. The rhetoric which dazzles the ignorant
will be seen in the light of Time to be usually stiff
and tawdry, poetically barren ; but the verses
“To a Black Gin,” “ A Piccaninny,” and similar
work, will be valued as by far the cleverest work
of the kind done in Australia, and ranking,,
despite some hardness, some surplusage, with .the
similar work of Calverley, Hood, and Praed. The
Darwinian theory has never been more skittishly
hit off than in Stephens’s verses on “The Power
of Science
. . . Through the Museum-window played
The light on fossil, cast, and chart;
And she was there, my Gwendoline,
The mammal of my heart. . . .
She leaned against the Glyptodon ;
She fixed her glasses on her nose ;
One Pallas-foot drawn back displayed
The azure of her hose. . . .
I showed how sense itself began
In senseless gropihgs after sense
(She seemed to find it so herself,
Her gaze was so intense.)
And how the very need of light
Conceived, and visual organs bore ;
Until an optic waftt evolved
The spectacles she wore.
How headless molluscs making head
Against the fashions of their line,
On pulpy maxims turned their backs,
And specialised a spine.
How landward longings seized on fish,
Fretted the type within their eggs,
And in amphibian issue dif-
Ferentiated legs. . . .
I hopped the quaint marsupials,
And into higher mammals ran,
And through a subtle fugue I stole
From Lemurs up to Man. . .
I turned to other, brighter themes,
And glancing at our different scales,
I showed how lady beetles are
Bobuster than the males.
I sang the Hymenoptera ;
How insect-brides are sought and got,
How stridulation of the male
First hinted what was what. . .
And when—perchance too fervently—
I smote upon the chord of sex,
I sawi the tardy spark of love
Blaze up behind her specs. . .
A mighty impulse rattled through
Her well-articulated frame;
And into one delighted ear
She breathed my Christian name. . .
She raised me from the enchanted floor,
And, as my lips her shoulder met,
Between two asthmas of embrace
She called me marmosette.
I strove to calm her down ; she grew
Serener and serener;
And so I won my Gwendoline,
My vertebrate congener.
Lovely! Here is the Pedagogue at school,
triumphant. Apart from verbal unction, the root
of value is the contrast between Romantic and
Prosaic to which Brunton Stephens appeals
always for his best effects. It is a contrast which
heightens the quality of the Pedagogue’s verse,
and often spoils the quality of the Poet’s. Fancy
draws the Pedagogue’s verse up; Fact drags the
Poet’s verse down. And through his literary life,
impelled by the craving for the Romantic
which he could not master, Brunton Stephens
has subordinated the Prosaic which he could
master—for want of tliat perception of incon-
gruity, that nice power of valuation of tones
and shades, which is the essence of critical
judgment of one’s own work and others’. When
the craze for horse-poetry swept over Australia in
the wake of Gordon, Stephens, like Kendall, at-
tempted to please the public with a poem about
horses. Kendall’s result was a grotesque mingling
of lyrical and profane ; Stephens’s energy pro-
duced “ The Godolphin Arabian,”a piece of clever
verse, but less, clever than Byron’s “Don Juan” —
taken as a model; and memorable only as an in-
tellectual tour de force. For the rest, Stephens
has written several plays, of which one,
“Fayette,” has been produced and published.
It has little value as literature ; none for
dramatic performance. Had be chosen, Brunton
Stephens might have written valuable prose, for
his fragmentary work in prose is shrewd, sane,
and brightly expressed ; and he had the persistent
force to execute a high literary or historical con-
ception. But always the rooted Poet in him has
been craving for the light, and always the stony
soil of the Pedagogue has prevented all but a few
stray tendrils from appearing. So the best of his
artistic output is the verso in which his natural
faculty has found free expression, the verse such
as that which is now borrowed to adorn this page.
B.
A PICCANINNY.
Lo by the “ humpy ” door, a smockless Venus !
Unblushing bronze, she shrinks not, having seen
us,
Though there is nought but short couch-grass
between us.
She has no polonaise, no Dolly Varden ;
Yet turns she not away, nor asketh pardon ;
Fact is, she doesn’t care a copper “ farden.”
And yet, her age her reputation spareth ;
At three years old pert Venus little careth,
She puts her hand upon her hip and stareth;
All unabashed, unhaberdashed, unheeding,
No Medicean, charmingly receding,
But quite unconscious of improper breeding.
’Tis well; it smacks of Eden ere came sin in,
Or any rag of consciousness or linen,
Or anything that one could stick a pin in.
Could boundaries, be neater ? posture meeter ?
Could bronze antique or terracotta beat her ?
Saw ever artist any thing completer ?
A shade protuberant, beyond Contesting,
Where this day’s ’possum is just now digesting,
But otherwise, all over interesting ;
Trim without trimming, furbelow, or bow on ;
Was ever sable skin with such a glow on ?
So darkly soft, so softly sleek, and—so on ?
Was ever known so dark, so bright an iris,
Where sleep of light, but never play of fire is—
Where not a soupgon of a wild desire is ?
Oh swarthy statuette ! hast thou no notion
That life is fire and war and wild' commotion ?
A burning bush, a chafed and raging ocean ?
Hast thou no questioning of what’s before thee ?
Of who shall envy thee, or who adore thee ?
Or whose the jealous weapon that shall score
thee ?
Hast thou no faint prevision of disaster—
Of dark abduction from thy lord and master—
Of aliens fleeing, kindred following faster ?
No faint forehearing of the waddies banging,
Of club and heelaman together clanging,
War shouts, and universal boomeranging ?
And thou the bone of all the fierce contention —
The direful spring of broken-nosed dissension
A Helen in the nigger apprehension ?
Nay, my black tulip, I congratulate thee,
Thou canst not guess the troubles that await thee,
Nor carest who shall love or who shall hate thee :
Recking as little of the human passions
As of the very latest Paris fashions,
And soaring not beyond thy daily rations !
Die young, for mercy’s sake ! If thou grow older,
Thou shalt grow lean at calf and sharp at shoulder,
And daily greedier and daily bolder;
A pipe between thy savage grinders thrusting,
For rum and everlasting ’baccy lusting,
And altogether filthy and disgusting ;
Just such another as the dam that bore thee—
That haggard Sycorax now bending o’er thee !
Die young, my sable pippin, I implore thee !
Why sbouldst thou live to know deterioration?
To walk, a spectre of emaciation ?
To grow, like that, all over corrugation ?
A trifle miscellaneous like her, too,
An object not “de luxe” and not “de vertu
A being odious even to refer to ?
Her childhood, too, like thine, was soft and
tender ;
Her womanhood hath nought to recommend her ;
At thirty she is not of any gender.
Oh, dusky foundling, let the warning teach thee !
Through muddiest brain-pulp may the lesson
reach thee.
Oh, die of something fatal, I beseech thee !
While yet thou wear’st the crown of morning
graces,
While yet the touch of dawn upon thy face is—
Back, little nigger, to the night’s embraces !
Hope nought: each year some new defect dis-
closes ;
As sure as o’er thy mouth thy little nose is,
Thy only hope is in metempsychosis.
Who knows but after some few short gradations,
After a brace or so of generations,
We two may have exchanged our hues and
stations?
Methinks I see thee suddenly grow bigger,
White in the face, and stateiy in the figure,
And I a miserable little nigger !
Should this be thus —oh come not moralising !
Approach not thou my humpy poetising !
Spare thine lambics and apostrophising !
Let subtle Nature, if it suit her, black me,
Let vesture lack me, bigger niggers whack me,
Let hunger rack me, let disaster track me,
And anguish hoist me to her highest acme—
Let me bear all thine incidental curses,
Nor share the smallest of thy scanty mercies,
But put me not —oh, put me not in verses !
She grins. She heedeth not advice or warning,
Alike philosophy and triplets scorning.
Adieu, then. Fare thee well. Ta-ta. Good
morning.
ON A FORK OF BYRONS.
Like any other fork.—No mark you meet with
To point S6me psychological conceit with.
An ordinary fork. A fork to eat with.
No individuality of fashion :
No stamp of frenzy fine, or poet-passion :
An article in no respect Parnassian.
No Muse “ with ivy sere ” hath ever decked it:
In fact, it would be foolish to expect it.
I question if the Muses recollect it.
A plain straightforward fork ; yet interesting,
As to the world in general attesting
That poetising hinges on digesting.
A fork not standing on its merits merely,
But, being Byron’s, testifying clearly
That verse and victuals are related nearly.
Quite genuine; crest and all; a fork to swear by:
Some poet-stories doubtless hanging thereby,—
Associations such as gold can ne’er buy.
For ’twixt the fork and the divine afflatus
The links are perfect; there is no hiatus ;
Fork, stomach, brain, pen,—all one apparatus.
So when the food that on the fork ascended
Grew into verse as with the brain it blended,
The fork wrote just as truly as the pen did.
For though the fork the earlier resource is,
Between the two no violent divorce is,—
I hold them to be correlated forces.
Perchance the unsuspected ministration
Of this same fork first set in circulation
The coinage of his rich imagination.
Perchance this very fork could give the clue to
What many of the famous thoughts were due to,
That now are part of me, and part of you too.
And if its prongs administered the fuel
That working duly unto brain-renewal
Kindled the thoughts that even yet fire you all, —
This very fork, —(unless I quite astray be,
And you of unimpressionable clay be), —
A factor in your moral product may be.
And musing thus, does not this fork begin to you
To seem as consanguineously akin to you
As if the bard himself had stuck it into you ?
’Tis ever thus : what Genius consecrateth
The nearest with the most remote collateth,
Till meanest use on highest issue waitetli. r
This salad, now, in which the fork I’m pressing,
Wherein are all sweet savours coalescing—
What subtle shoot of genius efflorescing
Flowered in the flavour of so rich a blessing?
Is it that Byron’s fork, some charm possessing,
Transmutes the—stop a bit.—Who did the dress-

RIOISIOH
.WITH HYPOPKOSPHITBS,
FOR
DELICATE
CHILDREN.
CHILDREN all like Angier’s Emulsion
and take it readily when they cannot
be induced to take Cod-Liver Oil.
Bland, soothing, creamy, and a splendid
tonic, it is just what the little ones need,
and it is really marvellous in many cases
to note the rapid improvement in weight,
strength, and colour. Give it to the
children if they have a cough or a cold;
if they are pale and thin; if they are
scrofulous or ricketty; if their food does
not digest or their bowels are out of order.
The medical profession prescribe it largely
in such cases, and it is used in children s
hospitals.

Why not look
young ? There’s
genuine pleas-
ure in holding
back Father
Time fif-
teen or
twenty
' years. You
can do it
easily with
Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, for it
gives all that dark
and rich look to the
hair which belongs to
young life.
Ayer’s
Hair Vigor
You know the story how good
Queen Bess, pointing to the beautiful
hair of a peasant girl, said, “There’s a
real royal crown. I would trade my
golden one for it.” That was long ago.
Now you can have a “realroyal crown”
of your own, simply by using Ayer’s
Hair Vigor. It makes the hair grow
thick and long and stops it falling out.
When your hair is rich and heavy,
and when the closest inspection fails to
detect a single gray hair, you will cer-
tainly look a great deal younger, and
you will be much better satisfied with
yourself, too. Isn’t that so ?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Forest.
Ye who are dwellers in streets where pain of
existence is sorest,
Come with me, kinsmen of mine, and leave Care
in the city behind —
I am T*™ f her of Trees, made free of the life of
the Forest
Innocent, thrilled with the sun and alive with the
songs of the Wind.
Forth from the city I pass, and I laugh at the
fetters that bound me ;
O but the Forest is green, and my blue-domed
world it is fair,
Delicate bird-life and bee-life piping and humming
around me,
Laughter of light in the leaves, and gladness
of life in the air.
Stately they stand in their ranks, my kinsmen,
the high and the noble,
Princes and chieftains in plumes, and a people in
garments of green ;
They with their valour of heart, and their courage
that laughs at mv trouble,
Knowing the Tree that I was and remembering
what I have been.
Beautiful Lady Acacia, with glimmering laughter
and gladness,
Shaking your head to a tune that is known but to
you and to me ;
Dear immemorial music and dearest green days of
sweet madness,
When you were the Lady Acacia and I was your
Lover the Tree.
Come with me, come with me, kinsmen! and pass
through the wonderful portals:
Deep in the heart of the Forest the mystical story
is told ;
Luminous shadows of gods, they are there, and
the pine-crowned immortals,
All of the Heroes and Stories, and all of the
Legends of old.
N.S.W.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
Night in the Streets.
The thraldom and the wizardry of sleep
Were on the City, and it came to me
That life and thought and spirit in a boundless
deep
Of dim, mysterious Silence lay and breathed un-
easily.
The straight, black pavement underneath my feet
Stretched on and on—it seemed stretched end-
lessly ;
And ever while I walked, as from some alien
street —
Some place where spectres hurried past—foot-
echoes came to me.
The city where I walked is no wise old,
No storied ruins crumble in her ways ;
How came it then that all her houses seemed to
hold
An age-old secret at their hearts—a tale of bygone
days?
How much of us is of the past ? And when
Sleep comes, what shapes of uncouth aeons start
From ancient burial to'try the souls of men—
The while the choked cry may not rise, nor break
the menaced heart ?
The unremembered lives we lived arise,
Their fear or fury chills or fires our blood,
Perchance we mark our red-mouthed foe with
timid eyes,
Or, with blood-hunger at our hearts, howl in a
midnight wood.
The thraldom of the Night—the demon thrall
Sinks earthward to its grave when stars grow wan,
And, faintly to our ears, there comes the Morning
call —
The challenge of the waking world, the cry of
man to man.
N.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
On the Banks of Vaal.
This is the chant heard by the sombre Vaal,
Sullenly flowing to the brooding sea.
For the dead in the trenches, row on row ;
For the anguish that flickered in glazing eyes
As the fancied echo of loved-ones’ cries
Gave a pang to the last wild dying throe;
For the long, vain hopes ; for the dull, swift blow
That widowed the wife and that orphaned the
child;
For the schemed-for gold, with blood defiled ;
May God in His justice curse you, Foe !
For Grief’s wild tears; for the sobs of Woe
Fierce wrung from a myriad bleeding breasts;
For the flames that flaunted their smoke-crowned
crests
As the homestead crackled and blackened below;
For the wrongs that never redress can know;
For the toll of a butchered nation’s knell;
For the smiling land you turned to hell
May God in His justice curse you, Foe !

SATURDAY, AUGUST 3, 1901.
An Elective Ministry.
It is something like meeting with an old
dead acquaintance to hear that the Elective
Executive Bill has been again introduced
into Maoriland House of Representatives.
It is born dead, as might be expected—in
fact, it seems to be even deader than it has
been in the five or six previous years. Sed-
don is against it, which practically seals its
fate. King Richard of Kumara is so accus-
tomed to be Premier of Maoriland as a
matter of course that the proposal to adopt
the Swiss system of formally electing the
Premier by Parliamentary vote is, in his
eyes, a personal insult, as casting a doubt on
his Gon-given right to the job and salary.
It is practically certain that he would be
elected, but the insult lies in the idea that
he needs formal election. As a matter of
fact, Maoriland does not require the Elective
Executive reform very badly just now. There
are only two parties, or one party and a
dishevelled smattering, in present Maori-
land politics, and ivhere there are only
two parties the old system of accidental
government works in a sort of fashion.
Where there are three, if the three
arc about equal in force and wholly diverse
in politics, it works very badly. Where
there are four it doesn't work at all. For
nearly 30 years South Australia was the
awful example in this continent, but S.A
politics have again consolidated on the two-
party basis, and the old machine is lumber-
ing along respectably once more. New
South Wales is the awful example to-day.
The system which is based on two parties—
one Government and one Opposition—has
gone to wreck. The Parliament which sits
in Sydney has consisted, for the last 10
years, of three parties, and now it has gone
a step further and split into four. And as
there can’t be three Governments and one
Opposition, or two Governments and two
Oppositions, or one Government and three
Oppositions, things are going wrong.
* ' • * *
The capsized political machine is based on
the theory that, say, 55 per cent, of the
House has a reasonable or unreasonable be-
lief that the Premier is the only infallible
man' to run the country, and, say, 45 per
cent, has a similar faith in the other man.
The Premier keeps his billet till, through
his mistakes or their own, enough of his fol-
lowing changes its opinion and transfers its
faith to the other man to place him in a
majority. It is taken so absolutely for
granted that a full majority of the House
must have a complete, boundless, all-round
faith in the Government, that when the
Government fails, on any one question of
importance, to command a majority, it has
to go. It has to be, in the opinion of the
House, incapable of doing wrong—like God,
or the Pope, or a sea-captain; when it
ceases to be so its career is ended. But the
N. S. W. Assembly is now split into four
sections—Government, Opposition, Labor
and Independent. They are not far from
equal, and no leader has the confidence of a
majority. There has been no leader for the
last ten years who really had the confidence
of a majority, which makes it highly advis-
able that the great confidence-trick was
abandoned. It never worked exceedingly
well, even under the two-party system,
which merely signifies that one crowd
says everything the Government does is
right even if it is wrong, while the other
party says that everything the Govern-
ment does is wrong, even when it is right.
It works still worse under the triangular
system, as lately practised in N.S.W., where
a Premier keeps in office because a minority
of the House thinks (probably through
mental incapacity) that he is the best man
for the position ; and another section which
doesn’t pretend to think he is the best man,
agrees to let him remain in office in return
for certain concessions, and to keep him in
till his opponent offers larger concessions.
The only redeeming feature, so far, is that
the third party has confined itself to asking
concessions which it regarded as good for the
country. The advent of a fourth party—or
rather a great, scattered crowd of Indepen-
dents, with no known leader or policy —
suggests that the time may be coming when
a Premier will have to make terms with
people who want concessions for themselves,
rather than for the country.
* ♦ * *
At present, almost anything which John
See proposes will be supported by his own
following, as a matter of course ; it may be
wrong, but it will be supported all the same.
It will be supported by the L ibor-party, if
he buys that support at a price in the shape
of concessions to Democratic principles—and
the country should be able to get such re-
forms as Manhood Suffrage, Old Age Pen-
sions, Early Closing, a State Land Bank, and
the like, without supporting John See’s
ruinous borrowing policy and his other follies
by way of payment. It will presumably be
supported by many Independents, if they
receive sufficient inducement, and what shape
their inducement will take is not yet known,
but if it assumes the old road-and-bridge-
and-culvert shape, the expense will be heavy.
And it will be opposed, openly or covertly,
by the Opposition, as a matter of course,
no matter how good or wise or bene-
ficial it may be. If the Labor - party
struck the greatest and noblest and wisest
idea yet devised in politics John See would
probably adopt it, even though he didn’t
believe in it, on condition the Labour mem-
bers kept him in office. That would be the
price See paid for their support. And the
price which the Labour members would pay
for See’s support would consist, as usual, in
winking at his enormous loans, and his in-
sane finance, and his systematic process of
running the country to ruin. (The Bulle-
tin here assumes that the Labour party has
sufficient conscience not to approve of these
things in its heart.) It would pay this price
because it wanted the votes of See’s follow-
ing to crush the opposition of Lee s follow-
ing. Yet it would be always possible that
so many of Lee’s following approved of the
idea in their hearts that it could be carried
without the Labour party buying anybody’s
votes with the wages of political iniquity—
if only the party system was abolished
and every proposal had a chance to go
on its merits. The Labour party, during
its 10 years existence, has been largely
responsible for many great reforms—but
some of them were not worth having at the
figure they cost. It purchased them by
winking at.follies and iniquities (presumably
it had sense enough to know that they were
follies and iniquities) that even a great re-
form would hardly pay for. It bought the
support of both Reid and Lvne at a price
that the support wasn't always worth—for
the Labor party bought their support quite
as much as they bought its.
* * * •
The most promising remedy seems to be,
as The Bulletin has often said before
(though it has been too busy about other
matters to say it very much of late) in the
adoption of the Swiss system whereby the
Ministry is elected for a fixed term by the
Assembly. Even in an Assembly of four
parties, or 24, some five or six individuals
must get a majority oyer the other five
or six or 97 candidates. The one difference
between that kind of Ministry and the kind
we are accustomed to is that it can get on
just as well without the confidence of a
majority of the House as with it. There-
fore, it is the only kind adapted to a Parlia-
ment where no one leader has the confidence
of a majority. The Ministry thus created
doesn’t need to buy support with concessions,
nor do sections of the House require to buy
concessions with support. If the Ministry
has the confidence of a majority, the House
probably passes its measures as they were
drafted ; if it hasn’t, the House probably
rejects the measures or alters them out of
all resemblance to their former shape.
Either way, the Ministry keeps its place till
its term is up, unless it resigns of its own
free will. In Switzerland it hasn’t even
a vote in the House. Under such a
method the Labor party, or the Indepen-
dent party, might vote to put See and
O’Sullivan in office if it thought they were
the best men, but it couldn’t do so because
they had promised any concessions in return.
A Ministry without a vote and with no
slavish following of its own has very little
power to grant concessions. Nor would See
and O’Sullivan want to buy with concessions
the Labor members’ connivance at their and
their party’s financial iniquities, because they
would have no party as the term is now
understood, and the connivance would do
them no real good in any case. When
an Old Age Pension Bill or some such mea-
sure was introduced under these conditions
there would be no See party supporting it
(possibly against its conscience) in order to
keep See in office, because its defeat wouldn’t
throw See out of office. Nor would there
be any Lee party opposing it (possibly
against its conscience) in order to get See
out of office, because its defeat wouldn’t*
throw See out of office. The Old Age Pen-
sion Bill would pass on its own merits, and
not because the Democratic party had pur-
chased the support of a shady Government
by . agreeing to be conveniently blind to
things that it should be fully aware of, in
order to vote down the hostility of a shady
Opposition which wanted the Democratic
party to purchase it instead—on the same
terms.
* * * *
There are no motions of want of confidence
under this system. The Government hasn’t,
at a crisis, to buy with billets or reckless
loan expenditure the half-dozen members
whose votes will save it from extinction, for
it isn’t affected by any crisis. No majority
condones the awful financial vagaries of a
G. Reid because it can’t condemn them
without throwing him and the Revenue
Tariff party out and putting the Protectionist
leader in ; it could amend Reid’s Estimates
and taxation proposals and everything else
that was his to any extent without throwing
him out. The only serious opening for cor-
ruption is that a prospective Minister may
make lavish and corrupt promises to secure
the votes that will put him into office, but
even this doesn’t amount to very much. He
has no permanent party of his own on whose
votes he can rely to enable him to keep these
promises. The men to whom he made them
can’t coerce him to keep them by threats of
desertion ; it doesn’t matter to him till his
three years expire if he is deserted, and
the member to whom the promises were
made is liable to disappear himself before
then. The system might often make a strong
Minister weaker in a desirable sense, by re-
ducing his power of dispensing patronage and
favors : it would certainly make a weak
Minister stronger by saving him from the
necessity of constantly buying with loan
moneys and grants and jobs and direct or
indirect bribes the half-dozen votes which
stand between him and political extinction.
But its great advantage is that it enables
every question to be considered on its merits
so far as the conscience of Parliament goes,
and the conscience of Parliament, in a com-
munity with the suffrage which New South
Wales enjoys, is as good a conscience as the
community deserves. It altogether elimin-
ates the ulterior considerations that the
rejection of a dubious measure may bring
about the fall of the Government, and that
will bring about other things, or that the
acceptance of a good measure may postpone
the fall of the Government, and “ our ” turn
at the loaves and fishes will be so much the
longer of coming.
Weights and Measures.
A comparatively obscure member of the Federal
Parliament, Edwards of N.S.W., whose plain
horse-sense is apparently as large as the public
knowledge of him is small, has procured a, com-
mittee to consider the advisability of establishing
decimal coinage. This is suggested as a step
towards the introduction of a complete metrical
system of weights, measures, and money in the
Commonwealth, though why the committee
doesn’t deal with the whole subject instead of a
fragment of it, is beyond comprehension. To
most people the metrical system is a mere abstruse
fad —a struggling of school-men after a useless
mathematical accuracy which is of no practical
interest or advantage to the multitude. In the
common opinion, the man who wants to introduce
it ranks with the person who wants to demonstrate
that the world is hat, and the person who believes
in the literal rendering of Revelations, and similar
learned debris of the human species. Yet the
man who succeeds in introducing that system in
Australia will be probably the greatest benefactor
this country has had up to date. He will remove
such a load of useless misery from the shoulders of
the rising generation as no Australian ever re-
moved before—and not only from the shoulders of
the generation that is rising now, but from those
of hundreds of generations which will begin rising
hereafter. He will get rid of a dull and cumbrous
stupidity that has blocked the path of education
for ages, and which has no single real advantage
to show by way of counterbalance to its useless-
ness. The present system of weights and measures
and money has only one alleged positive merit—
its antiquity ; and it has only one negative merit—
that the adult community which makes the laws
has got used to it in a sort of way, and finds it
easier to let things slide than to make them
better.
* ¥ k *
The weights and measures arid nidney which
Ausfralia inherited from Britain are such a sample
of the malice of inanimate objects as could only
exist in a community which had let things grdw
up mostly by themselves fdr 1000 years dr more.
It takes the average child a great part of its
time for from six to 12 months to learn them,
whereas the metrical system can be learned in as
many days. It takes years of wrestling with
arithmetic to become decently familiar with them
even after they have been formally introduced to
the mind. The central principle of the metrical sys-
tem—largely used in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium,
Greece, and other European States, and to some
extent in South and Central America and the
United States—is to have one measure of capacity
instead of about a dozen ; one measure of weight,
and one of length, and in all these tables (except
that of capacity, which goes up by hundreds), as
well as in the matter of money, each coin and
each measure contains one-tenth of the one imme-
diately following it. It practically reduces half
our arithmetic to a matter of adding one or two
naughts or shifting a decimal point. It simplifies
things so enormously that it saves something like
a year of every child’s educational life—a year of
hard labor, and tears, and floggings, and misery
over greasy slates and blotted exercise books.
And it can be remembered in after life by reason
of its simplicity. The British system is an un-
speakable chaos which nobody remembers, ex-
cept by scraps and patches, when once he has
quitted, school. After years of mental strain
in trying to master the gibbering British
arithmetic, how many educated men really know
when the information is wanted that there is a
difference of 800 feet between the length of a mile
at sea and a mile on land, and that one kind of
pound represents a weight of 2240 more grains
than another kind of pound. A system so intri-
cate that it requires enormous labor to learn it,
and so extra-intricate that nobody really remem-
bers it afterwards is a useless cruelty to the young
and a useless recollection to the old.
* * * *
The British arithmetical method is a fearsome
example of legislative non-interference. It grew
up sideways, endways, crooked, mixed and insane,
as the streets of Sydney, and the Chinese mone-
tary system, and the 2000 states of the old Ger-
manic Confederation did for similar reasons. It
is a quaint botch of a thousand local customs
mixed together for about the same number of
years. A British mile at sea is one thing and a
mile on land is another. There are three
separate tables of weights in daily use
(one of them—the avoirdupois—being further
disfigured by the fact that it contains two
weights, each called a stone, and representing
eight and 14 lbs. respectively) ; there are also
about half-a-dozen other tables of weights used in
separate trades. There are various dry
measures and various fluid measures, and
all these measures mount up on no regular
scale or system—two or five or three or eight or 15
or 60 of something make something else. There
is a measure of length in which seven inches and
ninety-two one-hundredths of another inch make
a link, and 5| yards or feet make a rod. Also,
there is a. square measure, in which 30| yards
make a rod. These also mount up by the same
chaotic process—nine of something makes some-
thing else, and 16 of another and 272 J; of a third
make two other things which progress in the same
course later on. The metrical system replaces all
these by three tables—in those of length and
weight everything progresses by tens ; in the table
of cubic measurement everything progresses by
hundreds, and great and intricate commercial
calculations can be made by adding a few
ciphers or shunting a decimal point to port or
starboard. It is a system which enables everyone
to know, as soon as he has learned simple addition,
multiplication, and division, almost all the arith-
metic that any business man requires, and it is
calculated to save a year out of everybody’s life in
the process of education. There will probably be
40,000,000 people in the Commonwealth some day
and 40,000,000 years, or even half-years, have an
appreciable cash value. Many boys could learn a
trade in the time which the metrical system would
save them, and yet know more arithmetic in the
end than they do now. As a matter of fact, the
metrical system is beginning to arrive of itself in
a small way. The American cental of 1001 b. is
familiarly quoted now in place of the ridiculous
British hundredweight, which doesn’t represent
100 of anything —but 112 out of pure cussedness.
And the American ton of 20001 b is also beginning
to be familiar enough to make it necessary to
learn two tons in place of one.
* * *
Of course, if the new idea comes the
cherished British sovereign will have to go. The
best known coins of commerce are the British
sovereign, which represents 20 shillings, each
containing 12 pence worth four farthings apiece
(the farthing, by the way, hasn’t even a symbol to
represent it and is shown by means of a fraction);
the American dollar of 100 cents ; and the French
and Belgian franc of 100 centimes, which is also the
standard, under various names, of Switzerland,
Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Italy, Romnania,
Servia and Spain. The dollar is probably
the more useful, standard of the two. It
has this additional recommendation that it
is as distinctly a British coin as the sovereign.
The British empire is itself a proof that the
lamentable money table, whereby four of one coin
and twelve of apother and twenty of another make
three other coins, is a cumbrous failure. The
dollar is the standard coin of Canada, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, British Hon-
duras, and a few other scraps, comprising among
them nearly half the area of the empire. Also about
three-fourths the populationof the empire uses the
rupee, and' is practically a stranger to the
British gold piece. The British £ won’t fit into a
decimal system anywhere. This is regrettable, for
it is the only coin in the lot which has made an
effort to be sane by containing 20 shillings instead
of 21, like the old guinea ; but its departure is un-
avoidable. If it was retained, and subdi"ided
into tenths and hundredths, it would only mean
that instead of three principal currencies used by
the commercial white man —based on the pound,
the dollar, and the franc—there would be four, and
the existing confusion would become still more
confused. The dollar was the early Australian
currency—the first balance-sheet of the Bank of
New South Wales was expressed in that coin—
and to go back to it is merely reverting to a useful
custom of our early history. If it was adopted
together with the beautifully simple and con-
densed French system of weights and measures,
it would lift a load of superfluous study off the
shoulders of young Australia, and if the time thus
saved was devoted to other useful branches of
learning it would lift this country 10 degrees in
the educational scale, besides making it vastly
more accurate in its accounts all the rest of its
days.
* * * *
Of course it would be something of. a burden on
the 3,000,000 or so of adult Australians to learn a


new system. But still they are only 3,000,000 —
and the unborn Australians, whose education it
would greatly simplify, are thirty, or three hun-
d l l ' e( h or any other number of millions. The
change would also oast obscurity on a certain
amount of British literature—that is to say, Aus-
tralia would have to print its own school-books
and many of its own works of reference in the
future, to the improvement of its printing-trade
and the increase of its self-reliance in literary
matters. Commercially the alteration would pro-
bably be beneficial rather than otherwise. The
greatest stumbling-block in the way of British
commerce nowadays is that it is based on
the most intricate and incomprehensible arith-
metic (with the possible exception of that of
China) on this earth. The Briton’s price-list
(which, by the way, he seldom translates for the
benefit of foreigners) is about as incomprehensible
to the average outsider as a map of the stars.
And the system is almost as incomprehensible to
the Briton himself. Out of the thirty odd million
adults in the United Kingdom there are probably
not a quarter of a million who could set to work
to find out the cost of 12 tons, 3cwt., 2qrs., 27Albs.
at Is. per lb., and get the sum right at the
first attempt, or the seventh either. The British
tables are especially built so that a man of respect-
able education may spend 1-g hours of time, worth
2s. per hour, in getting a sum wrong which,
under the metrical system, a person worth only
s£d. per hour could get right in four minutes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Westralian Slavery.
“ Carisbbook ” (W.A.) writes on the Westralian
native question :
W. Malcolmson (8., 22/6/’01) has a good grasp of the far
Nor’-West native question, and anyone who has lived in
these parts can fully bear out his statements. lam com-
pelled to write under a pen-name, as, should my name
be divulged, I would be served with a notice “ that
my services were no longer required ” for the posi-
tion I occupy. In a series of articles to the Mal-
don (Vic.) News, entitled “ Life in Westralia,” con-
tributed by me in Nov., 1899, I made these state-
ments among others, and I would like to repeat them
now :—“Slavery is existent to a very large extent through-
out the nor’-west part of Westralia; and I doubt if slaves
are so maltreated in any other country in the world. The
slaves are the aboriginals, more familiarly termed ‘ black
boys,’ _ and the slave-owners are the squatters. If an
ahoriginal is 50 years old, he is invariably recognised as a
‘ black boy,’ the same as if his age was only 15 years. The
‘ boys ’ are indentured to the squatters every 12 months,
and woe betide those who refuse to sign their mark on
the agreement drawn up. There are some 1200 of these
unfortunates employed on the various stations, and in
return for their services they receive daily just enough to
exist on. There are a few white men employed on each of
the stations who are known as slave-drivers. They are em-
ployed for no other purpose than to flog the unfortunate
blacks if they refuse to obey the orders of their owners,
or if they are dilatory in their work. Some of the
cruelties perpetrated on the blacks on the out-back
stations are disgraceful to any civilised nation. It
is a common occurrence for one to be flogged to
death or shot on the quiet, and the matter hushed up.
During my time in the Nor’-West I was aware of three
murders that had taken place, but which were all hushed
up. One case was a black boy about 14 years, who was
flogged to death by his master, a teamster. This the
teamster admitted to me. The boy had run away, was
captured, flogged, and died the same day. He was buried
along a road 40 or 50 miles from civilisation, and the
matter hushed up. Another case was an old aboriginal,
who was flogged by one of the white hands on a station
for losing half-a-dozen sheep out of a large flock which he
was shepherding. Two days afterwards the unfortunate
died. This was also hushed up. Another case was on a
station which has lately been attacked by natives.
Through ill-treatment a native ran away, was followed
into the desert, and shot through the thigh with a Win-
chester rifle. He was afterwards finished off with a
revolver shot. This was acknowledged to me by the
person who committed the offence.
“ There is less notice taken of the wilful murder of a
native in those parts than there would be of a dog.
Although dozens of these unfortunates have been mur-
dered during the last few years, yet no white man has
ever yet been hanged, or even found guilty of the charge
of murder, although two or three have been found guilty
of manslaughter, and sentenced to short terms of im-
prisonment. The juries are mostly composed of station-
hands, or other nigger-drivers, and their sympathies are
always with the white men. About 20 niggers have been
hanged during the last few years for offences against the
whites. These executions have been caused through
ill-treated natives turning on their owners and
attempting to spear them. The magistrate who
commits them for trial afterwards acts as Judge,
and pronounces the sentence of death when accused is
brought in guilty. The magistrate being one of the old
Groper sort; is also interested in the squatting stations.
I have seen these slaves sold from one teamster to
another, and it is a very common thing for the manager
of a station to hire them out at so much per week. Yet
we are daily boasting that Britons never shall be slaves,
that wherever the British flag waves its subjects shall be
a free and independent people. I saw a bullock-driver,
in a heated passjon, pull his black boy off a horse, tie his
hands behind his back, his legs together, and use his bul-
lock-whip on him till the blood was streaming from
his back. Another case of cowardly cruelty occurred
while I was on a visit to one of the largest and most
'mportant stations in that part of the State. The clerk
of the station, in my presence, horsewhipped two young
gins for fully ten minutes for a trivial offence they com-
mitted in their ignorance. Many readers might ask the
question—Why do not the aboriginal sympathisers take
their part when they are being treated so cruelly ? The
reason is obvious. The native sympathisers are few, and
it is a case of those few keeping their mouths closed if
they wish to live in that part of the State. The
squatters are the kings, and the Government is behind
them. The tyranny exercised by squatters, who are gener-
ally J’s.P., over native sympathisers makes life not worth
living in that part. The press of Westralia suppresses all
reports of cruelties perpetrated by squatters on their
niggers, unless the case is too glaring, such as the Ander-
son Bros.’ case, some two years ago, when they flogged
four natives to death at Ben Dhu station. One of the
brothers died in gaol while waiting for trial, the other
was found guilty of manslaughter, and sentenced to im-
prisonment for life— i.e., seven years’ imprisonment.
Seven years’ imprisonment for flogging to death two
black boys and two black females ; also flogging next
door to death two little black female mites, aged seven
and nine years respectively ! This is justice in Westralia.
I was shown a young gin’s back, who had been flogged by
one of these same two individuals, and the sores made by
a knotted rope were sickening to look at. If these unfor-
tunates ever run away, they are chased on horseback by
their owner with a revolver, brought back, tied up and
flogged, or taken before a J.P., who is generally another
squatter, and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment
for breach of agreement. They are forced to sign the
agreement, or woe betide them. Their signature is
always a mark, and they are quite ignorant as to the con-
tents of the agreement. The agreement sets forth that
they will obey the instructions of their masters, do any
work when requested, and in return for services they are
to receive rations—a little damper or weevily flour daily.
When a black becomes decrepit and worn-out through
old age, and the squatter can make no further use of him,
he is left to die like a dog. If a station becomes short-
handed, a party will generally go out into the desert,
capture and chain a few, and bring them in. These are
not always civilised, but the lash soon tames them into
civilisation. How much longer this slavery is to continue
God only knows.”

Hanging the Rebels.-
Last week the cable reported a rather extensive
hanging of Cape Colony insurgents, and the
passing of long gaol sentences upon many more.
The hangees were British subjects of Dutch
descent, who had joined their countrymen of the
Transvaal and the Orange Free State—and they
went the way such people naturally do when the
fortune of war goes against them. The rebel has
to take his chance in such oases. Just about 100
years age Britain seized the Dutch territory of the
Cape, and converted the Dutch population into
British subjects against their will. Its claim
upon their fealty is exactly the same as that of
Russia on Poland and Finland ; or the claim that
England iiad on Scotland m the days of Wallace,
or on F ranee in the days just before JOAN OF Akc, or
on Wales in the time of Llewellyn, or in Ireland in
the long dreary ages when Roderic O’Conor, and
Art ARMurrogh and Hugh O’Neil successively
propped upthefalling banner of national independ-
ence. Britain has at the Cape the same right the
Austrians had in Hungary and Italy, or Napo-
leon I. in Germany, and which the Normans had
in England, and which Britain lias, and Russia
hopes to have, in India—the right of the stronger.
There is no other way to build great empires. And
when any degraded rutfian and traitor like William
Wallace, who was hanged 600 years ago; or
Boer farmer Coetzee, who was hanged the other
day; or Kossuth, who would probably have ended
in the same way if Britain hadn’t given him a
shelter ; or Riel, whom the British “executed”
in Canada ; or Here ward the Englishman, whose
resistance to his lawful Norman annexer was
bitter and reprehensible; or Joan of Arc, or
Boadicea, or Washington, or Kolokotrones
rises against his (or her) rightful sovereign-by-
annexation, he (or she) calls for no consideration
from any right thinking individual. Some day it
would be worth while to. write a history of the
British empire-breakers, with denunciatory foot-
notes. Henry 11. laid the foundations,
by inheritance and conquest, of a great
British empire covering England, Scotland,
Ireland, Wales, and most of France, and
Edward I and his successors toiled to con-
solidate it. Philip Augustus captured the French
section of it. Those two base rebels against the
British empire, Wallace and Bruce, broke it
in two by severing Scotland ; Wallace was
hanged (just like Boer farmer Coetzee, the
other day), and Bruce only escaped execu-
tion by succeeding. Possibly he got it hot
in the next world to make up. Art McMur-
ROGH and others shattered the imperial power
in Ireland, and it wasn’t till 200 years
later that the real annexation followed. Du
Guesclin broke the second French empire, and
Joan of Arc the third. Washington broke the
empire again, and the conduct of that seditious
person, who somehow escaped his well-deserved
fate, calls for severe condemnation. Riel tried
to be a Washington in Canada, and died of the
attempt. And a handful of obscure Cape Dutch-
men, who had somehow never become reconciled
to the 100-year-agone conquest of their country,
took up their rifles last year and went out on the
well-trodden path of all these and other degraded
and reprehensible characters—of William Wal-
lace, Robert Bruce, George Washington,
Kosciusko (“and Freedom shrieked when
Kosciusko fell ”), of Joan of Arc, Kolokotrones,
Kossuth, of the Scotch Covenanters, of theTyrolese
hero Andrew Hofer, of the German rebels who
rose against Napoleon I, of the Spaniards whom
Wellington assisted in their great fight against
the same annexing potentate, of Herewakd the
Saxon, and of the Irishmen of ’93. They had
better luck than Joan of Arc, who was burned
alive by the English ; or-the men of ’93, who were
variously hanged, flogged, or scalped with that
weird contrivance, the pitch-cap ; or the captured
Covenanters who were often tortured before exe-
cution ; and about, as good luck as Wallace, who
was hanged by the English ; and not quite so
good as Kosciusko, the Pole, for though Freedom
shrieked when he fell, his captors doctored his
wounds and soon set him at liberty. Things like
these are necessary incidents in the building of
empires, and it is absurd to talk of them in any
unfriendly spirit. Still, it is shocking to the
mind of any right-thinking person, at this time of
general enthusiasm about Imperial unity, to learn
that a statue has been, or is going to be, erected in
the loyal city of Dunedin to William Wallace,
the rebel who did his best to break the first British
empire; and to hear disloyal Scotchmen holding
forth with enthusiasm about Robert Bruce, who
really did breakit —who broke it twenty times worse
than Paul Kruger ever attempted to do. Also,
the drinking of the toast of “ Washington ” on the
4th of July should be made a heavily-punishable
offence. These people may be dead, but they
represent exactly the principle for which Boer
farmer Coetzee was hanged last week, and it is a
principle that can’t be put down too low or hanged
up too high.

Philp’s Idea.
Queensland Parliament met the other day with
the spectre of the Half-Million Deficit in the
chair, and the first anxiety of the House was
naturally to know what Premier Philp was going
to do about it. A country with a revenue of less
than £4,100,000 and an expenditure of well over
£4,600,000 is in a bad way, and something cer-
tainly needs to be done. Apparently Premier
Philp doesn’t intend to do anything. He com-
menced by saying that he had every confidence
that “Queensland would soon see prosperity
again”—in other words he stuck to the good old
fiction that the tremendous boom lately created
with borrowed money was just the country's ordi-
nary state, and that the present condition was
one of unnatural and temporary depression. To
any rational individual, who wasn’t sodden with
the borrowing disease, it might rather appear that
Queensland is still in an inflated state through
borrowing and booming, and when it gets into an
ordinary state of prosperity the revenue—with
the taxes as at present —will be less than it
is now, rather than more. For the financial year
just closed —the one with the awful deficit: —
Queensland had, per inhabitant, about the largest
revenue in AustralasiaI—barring 1 —barring only Westralia,
which is in the midst of a still worse borrowing
boom. And yet Queensland doesn’t levy land and
income taxes, as the Southern States do. TJnder
these conditions the fair inference is that, if
Queensland only borrowed as much in proportion
to population as the other States, its revenue, in
times of ordinary prosperity, would be less than
it is now, unless extra taxes were imposed. Philp
is of opinion that if all the Syndicate Railway Bills
had been passed last session things would have
been better. In other words, Queensland has
already more railway in proportion to population
than almost any other place on earth ; and if still
more railways had been built the boom might
have been kept going at full speed a little longer.
Meanwhile Philp’s only idea is to increase land
sales. Theyare alreadygoingon at the rate of about
£200,000 a year. So they will have to be increased
to £700,000 or £300,000 to fill the gap, even if the
gap grows no bigger. And, on top of all, Philp
talks wildly of selling enough land to pay off the
public debt of about £36,000,000. Queensland has
about 400,000,000 acres still unsold, but when all the
desert areas are deducted this doesn’t amount to
quite as much as it looks. Still if Queensland de-
cided to pay off its liabilities, and to have no more
public debt, and held a great and successful clear-
ing sale of land for that purpose, it would save
£1,300,000 a year in interest. That is a big item.
On the other hand, it would lose most of its present
land revenue (used to cover ordinary expenditure)
of £600,000 a year, for the land from which it is
derived would "have gone in payment of the debt.
It would no longer have £900,000 or £1,000,000 of
borrowed money coming in. And it has
still to face the fact that its income is
£500,000 short of expenditure. Apparently if
Queensland cleared off its present debt by land
sales, and didn’t start any new debt, it would
want about £700,000 or £300,000 a year more
taxation, on the present system, to keep it out of
the poor-house. And even if it started to contract
a new permanent debt at the same rate as it is now
contracting the old one, it would only have a
surplus of £200,000 a year, and the interest on the
new debt would be big enough in six or seven
years to eat that up. The fact is that Queensland
has a huge public estate, but all of it that is good
enough to attract tenants is leased and bringing in
rent. In many cases it brings in very little rent,
but that is chiefly because it isn’t worth any
more ; certainly the rents aren’t sufficiently below
value to allow either the squatter or the Q.N. Bank
to make a fortune just now. And if the land is sold
wholesale to pay off the public debt the revenue
from rent naturally diminishes. The thing may
not be as broad as it is long, but it isn’t so far from
it as might be supposed. And unless better
seasons come—well, how much would all Queens-
land west of Longreach fetch in one lot !

Work for the Refuse-Shifter.
In January, 1900, N.S.W. Public Service Board
noticed a considerable smell arising from the
Health Office and the State Hospital at Little Bay.
The Board’s attention was called thereto by one
Glynn; probationary-assistant-storekeeper at the
Coast Hospital. Glynn was booted out of his
billet because his immediate superior, Willman, re-
ported against the confirmation of his appointment.
Glynn had been set to work there on the under-
standing that if he did his work well he would be
permanently employed. He placed the Board in
possession of facts which led to the discovery of
abuses which the matron swore had been going on
for seven years. On May 13, 1901 (letter M.
01/5414, paragraph 3), the Board reported :
. . . he (Glynn) had undoubtedly done good service to
the State, in that he was instrumental in exposing the
existence of a serious state of affairs at the Coast Hospi-
tal, and it was in view of this fact that the Board recom-
mended that he be paid salary for six months.
Furthermore, the Board propose to give Glynn other
employment when a position for which he is suitable
becomes vacant.
It took the Board 16 months to find a position for
which he was suitable, and then it was only a
temporary one, and worth about £25 per annum
less than Glynn’s original position at the Coast
Hospital—the one from which he was ejected for
“ having done good service to the State.” Then
the Board got to work on the men who had failed
to prevent the abuses through exposing which
Glynn was sacked, and after several months’
inquiring and investigation it submitted a report,
bits from the summary of which read like this: —
. . . The late contractor, Mr. Kidman, appeared to have
done pretty much as he liked. It was shown that time after
time the Medical Supt. reported that the supplies received
from Mr. Kidman were unsatisfactory, and that goods had
frequently to be rejected. Notwithstanding that the
terms of the contract provided stringent conditions by
fine, and, if necessary, cancellation, to meet such a con-
dition of affairs, nothing appears to have been done. In
justice to Dr. Ashburton Thompson the Board pointed out
that many of the complaints were not brought under his
notice. With regard to fish supplied to the Coast Hospital
the evidence showed that the Supplies by the contractor
were often very inferior, sometimes putrid and quite unfit
for food. On such occasions the hospital obtained what
was required from Oiiinnery, of Sydney, whose price was
4d. per lb., but Kidsian was allowed to submit a voucher
including the fish supplied by Oiiinnery and to charge Is.
per lb., his contract rate. In other words, Kidman re-
ceived back his rejected fish, and after the hospital
authorities had, by his action, been put to the trouble
and expense of sending to Sydney to obtain proper
supplies, he was paid Bd. for every lb. of fish so obtained.
For Pommery champagne Kidman was paid 9s. per pint—
the usual retail price being ss. or 6s. Mr. A. Kidman has
been largely overpaid on account of fish, fruit, rolled oats,
etc. The sum of at least £155 12s. (in what period not
stated) should be put down to that account. The Board
have come to the conclusion that Messrs. Willman and
Gullick have forfeited all right to the confidence of the
Govt. They have both shown that their word is not to
be trusted, and they have failed signally to properly safe-
guard the interests of the Dept. Both officers should be
called upon to show cause why their services should not
be dispensed with.
Accordingly, the Board appointed Dr. Norton
Manning, late Inspector-General for the Insane,
to hear the case. Gullick and Willman were
represented by counsel, and the Board were re-
presented by one Brodie, who had previously
made a fearful and wonderful investigation into
affairs at the Coast Hospital. Gullick was
charged with perfunctory examination of accounts
and vouchers, resulting in loss to the Govt.; unduly
favoring a late contractor to the Coast Hospital
and Quarantine Station, North Head; giving
evasive evidence, and general indifference to the
best interests of his department. And Dr.
Norton Manning decided that the perfunctory
examination of vouchers was proved as far as it
related to certain articles not in contract, but it
did not appear to be proved that Gullick had
favored the late contractor. Gullick and
the late contractor, Arthur Kidman, had
been school-fellows, and it was shown
that Gullick, while Kidman was a contractor,
had unwisely accepted some minor favors at his
hands ; but there was no imputation of anything
in the shape of bribery or venality in Gullick’s
dealings with the contractor, and it appeared that
Kidman’s accounts, which had been passed with
over-charges, had been so passed by reason of
carelessness or laxity, and not by design, or with
any idea of favoring the contractor. It was also
decided that Gullick did not appear to have
given dishonest evidence, although it was found
that his evidence was undoubtedly evasive and
unsatisfactory; and the court did not consider
that the charge of general indifference was fully
sustained. Willman was charged with perfunc-
tory examination of vouchers for supplies to the
Coast Hospital, Little Bay, leading to loss to the
Govt. : unduly favoring a late contractor for sup-
plies to the Coast Hospital, and obstructing the
late temporary storekeeper; giving dishonest
evidence, and general indifference to the best
interests of the Govt., and the decision was this ;
Charge 1: As it stands, not proved, but it is clearly '
shown that Mr. Willman’s action in regard to certain
supplies and the charges made therefor resulted in a loss
to the Govt.
Charge 2 : Not considered proved.
Charges: Practically admitted, but it is pointed out
that, except in this one matter, no exception appears to
have been taken as to the character and straightforward-
ness of Mr. Willman’s testimony.
Charge 4 : Not fully substantiated, although there are
matters, particularly in connection with the “ diet lists”
mentioned in the report, as to which Mr. Willman did
not display the interest and care which he should have
done.
Then it was announced that Willman and Gul-
lick are to be transferred to other departments
and suffer a reduction of £25 per annum each.
Willman, while at the Coast Hospital, was rated
as £250 per annum, but he was charged £3O per
year for rent, so his actual cash receipts were
£220. He is now to get £225. And Glynn, the
man who did good service by revealing the shame-
ful mismanagement of the institution also loses
£25 a year, in addition to losing his entire salary
for many months. The reward of good service in
N.S.W. is evidently a vast amount worse than
the reward of bad service.

Madden and Peacock.
“Vindex” writing to The Bulletin clearly states
the position :
Editor Bulletin. —Is the Victorian law, is the Victorian
executive, not sufficient for Victoria? Is the British
Government to perform executive functions in and for
Victoria? Judging from the manner in which the corres-
pondence between Madden and Chamberlain has been
treated in Vic. Assembly there seems to he no one left
there possessing sufficient knowledge of our constitutional
rights, and sufficient manliness, to bring Madden and
Peacock to task for their extraordinary conduct. Madden,
Lieutenant-Governor, sees in his morning’s Argus, in
heavy leaded type, the words “ Foul libel on the King,”
and reads that the little Tocsin has republished the
article which appeared in the Irish Peodle. Now is his
chance—the chance of a lifetime—to show servility to the
Colonial Office, to show contempt for “ that humbug,
Responsible Government—to show that he is the good
little boy, that he does not hold the principles for which
that grand old lion, Higinbotham, fought—the principles
which kept Higinbotham from being appointed lieutenant-
governor, but which have tended to keep our people free
from the meddling and muddling of the Colonial Office.
Madden —without seeing the condemnatory remarks with
which the Tocsin introduced the Irish article—summons
his Ministers to his awful presence, strokes his fieroel.v-
waxed moustache, advises them to advise him to seize all
that is left of the Tocsin —that ill-disposed paper, as His
Ex. condescends to call it—to seize it, not under any
Victorian law, but as agent for the British Ministers, if
the British Ministers will adopt his act as an “ Act of
State.” The Victorian law, forsooth, is not sufficient, in
his opinion, to deal with seditious libels ; therefore he
asks (not an amendment of the Victorian law, but) that
an outside authority, the British Ministry, shall act, and
act through him, under the mystic force of the cabalistic
phrase—“ an Act of State ” 1 Peacock, on the advice of
Madden, advises Madden to send the silly message to
Chamberlain. But Chamberlain, whatever he is, is not
a fool; and he has at his elbow one or two men
who know something of constitutional law, and of the
relations of the British executive to the Colonies.
He replies—“Defence of Act of State nob available
against British subject.” Of course, it is nob. We know
nothing of a droit administratif in our system, thank
goodness. Every officer of the King must keep within
the law; and, in a State enjoying Responsible Govern-
ment, he must keep within the law of the State. A
well-deserved snub to a Lieutenant-Governor who, as
Chief Justice, ought to have known better.
After reading this sickening despatch of the Lieutenant-
Governor, it is as good as a tonic to read the
historic letter written by George Higinbotham to Sir
Henry Holland (now Lord Knutsford) in 1887: “ You
will observe that I address you in j our private capacity
as an English politician interested in colonial affairs, and
not in your character of her Majesty’s Secretary of State
for the Colonies Her Majesty’s Ministers for
Victoria possess the power, and on them alone devolves
the supreme and the hitherto neglected duty of vindicat-
ing public law in the colony, and of protecting the ex-
alted office of the Queen’s representative from the indig-
nity of illegal invasion The creation by statute
of the system of Responsible Government necessarily in-
volves the vesting in the representative of the Crown of
all,powers and prerogatives of the Crown necessarj' in the
conduct of local affairs and the administration of the
law.” Higinbotham may have carried his antagonism to
the Colonial Office to an extreme. tjut he saw more
clearly than others that,.Australians must be treated as
men, not as schoolboy's, much less as whipped spaniels ;
and, therefore, his reputation
will gather strength of life with being,
And live hereafter more admired than now.
In the meantime, we are suffering from Madden and
Peacock. When will Australians learn to distinguish
true metal from tinsel—to admire public spirit and un-
selfishness more than smug self-complacency—to appre-
ciate simplicity of manner rather than garish gawds and
vulgar decorations ? Peacock —well, he is leader of the
so-called Liberal party. By tradition, that party is the
custodian of the rights of the people against the unlawful
aggressions of the Crown or the Government. But who
is to watch the guardians themselves ? When the leader
of the Liberal party does not appreciate this noble tradi-
tion, expels an alleged criminal from Parliament before
he has been tried for the alleged crime, and invokes the
aid of the British Executive to maintain law in the
State, it is time for the people to wake up.

Vic. Laborites talk of testing the legality of
Findley’s expulsion. They may as well save
their money. The question was tested in ’66. In
March of that year, on the rejection of the Appro-
priation Bill by the Upper House, the M'Cul-
loch Ministry resigned. Next day the Argus
observed that Mr. M'Culloch’s statement on
resigning fairly bristled with falsehoods.” For
this publisher Hugh George was sent to the
dungeon beneath Parliament Hous§. The Argus
raved and swore at large (also at Attorney-
General Higinbotham), and finally appealed to
the Privy Council, giving barrister K. 1). Ireland
a 1000-guinea fee to go and argue the case. The
Council decided that Vic. Assembly possessed
all the powers of the House of Commons in the
way of doing as it pleased with any subject
brought before it. That seems about comprehen-
sive enough to cover anything, and it isn’t good to
waste the money of the masses, made by hard
bootmaking and the like, in feeing their natural
enemy, the lawyer.

The truth about Barnum-Powell and the bogus
siege of Mafeking ■ has at last reached England.
Sydney Telegraph, which gave a page of pic-
tures and letterpress to “ The Belief,” and mean-
dered down history past Gibraltar and Plevna
vainly looking for parallels to “ this tremendous
achievement,” now reprints from London
Morning Leader a returned M.L. trooper’s
account. Says this uncompromising warrior,
“referring to the fact that B.P. has not been
greatly rewarded for his services ” :
The truth is that the military authorities don’t think
much of Baden-Powell or his work. The whole of the
Mafeking business was a “ frost.” I was for four months
in the neighborhood with Plumer’s force, and Plumerwas
so anxious about the condition of the besieged, he was so
certain that they’ were starving, that he economised his
own provisions, and for months before the relief we were
on a biscuit a day . and half-rations. When Mafeking was
relieved it turned out that Baden-Powell had full provi-
sions for a year, and there had been no want. Plumer
was awfully mad. He sent a few waggons of food and
stores into the town just for appearance sake, and to
make a show for the paper men ; but he was awfully
wild. Out there we didn’t understand why Mafeking was
made so much of by London. Baden-Powell was no par-
ticular hero with the troops, and those behind the scenes
knew that there was little or nothing in the Mafeking
business. But he got his men into muddles once or twice
in the open as well; so there is not much difficulty in
understanding how London’s idol had no particular
rewards.
The M.L. trooper had more to say about the
famous London volunteers whom the Stock Ex-
change crocodiles wept over, and in whose honor
some scores of people were killed and injured on
the day of their drunken return —
On the subject of Tommies in general, our Maori-
lander was fairly flattering— i.e., he didn’t show up their
shortcomings as fighters, but paid a tribute to their
behaviour, which was wonderful, “when you think where
they are recruited.” Concerning the C.l.V.’s, the
Maorilander said a good deal that was very nasty. Boiled
down, his remarks came to this : The C.l.V.’s, weren’t a
ha’porth of good, and their home-coming was hurried up
because of their uselessness.
These things confirm The Bulletin’s oft-repeated
declaration that the cables disseminated by Jingo
agents in Africa, trimmed by military censors to
suit British tactics, and circulated by the Aus-
tralian press, are simply a mass of lies, either
direct or by suppression. Yet they are still swal-
lowed as fact by thousands of gullible Australians!

“The King of Crime,” which opened on
Saturday night at Sydney Lyceum, comes to us
with a certain halo through the recollection of
Albert Marsh’s fine rendering of the character
some few years ago, and it still remains an excel-
lent melodrama at Anderson’s theatre in spite of
the actors and actresses occasionally getting in
the road. The “King” is an interesting man,
who has a craving to be a respectable citizen and
the head of a robber gang at one and the same
time. Hs inclination to be a secret assassin he
explains rather vaguely, by the statement that in
“ every man there is the instinct to kill,” and he
also remarks that he had no woman friend to tell
him not to. a man gets into the paths
of wickedness he generally contrives to put it all
on the woman that was there, and when she
wasn’t there he puts it on her for not being there.
The play starts when the hero is beginning to get
his two lives tangled up, so that he has to make
himself several other people in a hurry, in the
hope of smoothing things out. He ends by en-
gaging himself as a detective to hunt himself
down, in which character a traitor member of his
own gang gives him valuable information as to
his own whereabouts. There is also in this play
a much-travelled will, which sometimes brings
peace by being waved from the top of a tree, and
on other occasions binds up the broken heart by
being rescued j ust in time from the flames. There
is also a clock which behaves humorously, and mid-
night chimes which have a tragic effect. Besides
which, several women declare that nothing shall
part them from their husbands, when they immedi-
ately are parted without any difficulty whatever. A
considerable amount of shriek and sudden gloom
and stealthy forms groping about with dark
lanterns pervade the remainder of the drama, the
whole ending with a large pair of hands appearing
from behind a curtain and dragging the victim to
be choked at leisure behind the scenes and cast
back before the footlights when the business is
completed.
* * • *
Robert Inman, as the homicidal hero,
loses some telling points, notably where he counts
out members of the gang and lets them go till the
last one, the traitor, is left to be dealt with alone.
The scene ought to be as impressive as a funeral,
and consist of a considerable amount of silence
and shudder. Inman, however, calls his men
like a teacher going through the roll, and they
scamper out like schoolboys, there being no
impressiveness whatever until the hero disappears
cleverly into nothingness through the wall. There
is some good work by some of the subsidiary
characters, though Dora Mostyn does not suit
short skirts, and has more Australian cheek than
the necessary French “chic” in her manner.
Bert Bailey appears as a would-be son-in-law who
mesmerises pa into smiling on his suit, though the
mesmeric smile of pa is something to dream of,
not to tell. This is a good French touch. In
England, where girls have no dowries, it is some-
times the young man who has to be mesmerised
by pa into keeping on with his suit.

The “ Dangerous Women ” continue to be
alarming in an aimless way at the Criterion
Theatre, Sydney. In this illogical literary
effort the nearness of the heroine to a lunatic
asylum appears, to the author’s judgment, to make
it quite feasible that anyone who has a down on
her should be able to put her in at once.
Several people who are wandering about the pre-
cincts that day are also brought inside, the idea
being that any person indulging in mild eccentri-
cities round an establishment of this sort, can be
collected and put in a cell without any preliminaries
whatever. Miss Roland Watts Phillips as a news-
paper boy is an excellent boy—not a stage-boy at
all, but the sort you could meet in Pitt-street,
and buy a “pyper” from any afternoon without sus-
picion. A good many shows are announcing their
more or less regrettable end this week, but
“ Dangerous Women ” isn’t one of them. It will
rage in its haziness and its public administration
of chloroform till further notice.

The Italian Opera season at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, starts with “Aida” for two sufficient
reasons. Firstly, it is a great spectacle, and the
dramatic action of the opera commends it to the
understanding of a public whose ear is unaccus-
tomed to the sound of Italian words. Secondly,
it introduces the biggest roof-raising voices which
are entitled, by law of etiquette, to get first hear-
ing in each city the company may visit. The two
declamatory principals, Signora Benedetto and
tenor Larizza, take precedence of Signora
Sapio and Dani, whose singing is just a
little more sweet and less powerful. The two
lighter sopranos, Dalia Bassich and the sprightly
Vaccari, don’t appear in any of the first
two or three operas. From a managerial
point of view there is only one objection to
“ Aida” as the pioneer opera of the season. The
brown face and short skirts of the name part
make it very hard for a plump little prima-donna
like Benedetto, to impress a new audience with
her singing and acting. She has to produce her
top note under the worst of conditions for herself
personally, and if she raises herself on her toes as
she lifts that mighty note it only makes the short
skirts look still shorter. Meanwhile it may be
mentioned in an irrelevant sort of way that the
“ Casino Girl ” will be still visible to-night
(Thursday) and Friday.
Robert Brough produces “Mrs. Dane’s
Defence ” at Sydney Royal on Saturday. As it
is the play’s first appearance in Australia this
country is still unaware of the nature of the
charge brought against the lady, but certain
London papers speak highly of the piece, and the
fact that it was written by Henry Arthur Jones
is a guarantee that it won’t be the worst kind of a
failure. Also, if Brough appears for the defence it
may be fairly assumed that Mrs. D. gets every
possible chance to clear her character, if she has
one to clear. Between Brough and Jones it
ought to be possible to get even J. Iscariot off on
a technical point, or at least to hire somebody to
swear an alibi. The “Second in Command”
finishes its over-long' career on Friday. Now
that the small, hesitating Duke of York
is off the premises it may be suggested
with comparative safety that the huge, breezy, and
very decided Duke of Hull, who comes, on behalf
of his father, the King, to decorate Major Bing-
ham, didn’t help the “ Second in Command.”
When a large section of the public had just been
disappointed in a small duke it didn’t want to
have the thing rubbed in by being rushed at by a
big duke. And the small section which was satis-
fied with the real duke probably resented the in-
ference that Brough knew better what size an
heir apparent ought to be than the heir apparent
himself. Brough ought to have remembered that
an heir apparent is always the right size. His
size becomes the right size through him being it.
We commence to suspect Brough of being a pro-
Boer.
*# * *
Brough’s other show, conjuror Bertram,
ends his career at Sydney Palace on Friday. The
final verdict is that he is an exceedingly clever
conjuror—as clever as any this country has seen—
but that most of his illusions have been seen here
before. The populace is no nearer finding out
how they are done than it was years ago, but that
isn’t the question. If the populace had been
around ip Genesis, when animals were being
created, it would probably have got no nearer
learning how to create new animals itself, but, all
the same, by the time the 75th animal was
created, it would have lost all interest in
the proceedings. If someone could invent a
number of perfectly new tricks, even though they
might be less clever than the old tricks, it would
give Bertram’s line of business a great lift.

The Leslie Brothers are the latest addition
to the bill at Sydney Empire, and their musical
burlesques are always good for several encores.
The Leslies, somehow, never seem to catch cold,
as everybody else does.

At the Tivoli, Madame Lucretia, lately
from London, dances “speciality” dances, wears
nice frocks, and sings the latest Old World songs.
Whelan, the mimic, is in his last week, and will
leave shortly for Fogtown, where much affluence
should be available for a man of his talent.

The Adelaide public gave a moderate sup-
Eort to Rignold in melodrama at the Royal, but
as rushed Hawtrey in the “Message from Mars.”
Meanwhile the Tivoli, having got over its birth-

cluding Latona the Tramp, Austin Rudd and
Lizzie Kirk.

This is a revolutionary week at Melbourne
theatres. The Italian Opera Co., which took pos-
session of Her Majesty’s on June 1, passed out
with the winter on July 31, unless something
happened to break the word of the advt. Last
Saturday added a successful “ Rigoletto ” to
the other good results of this foreign invasion,
and brought the season’s record up to seven operas
—counting “ Pagliaeci ” and “ Cavalleria” as one
show. A mixed bill was to play the Italians off
the premises on Wednesday. They return in
December, by which time Melbourne will pro-
bably have developed a fuller appreciation of the
fine entertainment that Hazon engineers.

Wilson Barrett makes his re-appearance
in Australia at Her Majesty’s aforesaid next
Saturday (August 3rd) with the intention of
staging eight or nine plays in eight weeks. The
people W.B. brings with him this time are mostly
the same as before, also several of his former pro-
grammes will be repeated, and the performances,
new or old, will have the polish of experience on
them, anyhow. Season opens with “Man and
his Makers,” a novelty to these regions, and
Wilson Barrett will appear as principal Man in
the play he helped to make.

At the Princess’s a satisfactory explana-
tion of “ Why Smith Left Home ” is to be offered
to Melbourne for the first time on Saturday next
(3rd). The city has grown thirteen months older
since Charles Arnold and his comedy co. went
away to roam Australasia, but the memory of
“Jones” has been kept green by tales of his
prowess on tour. Moreover a favorable report
upon the Smith who forsook his domicile has been
in the air of the temporary capital for some time.
Consequently the arrival of Arnold and co. and
this alleged joke|is looked forward to with peculiar
satisfaction by the frivolous, who are a great and
growing majority thereabouts. One hears the
typical giddy girl in the tram-car referring to
“Why Smith Left Home” as though she hopes
he was actuated by improper motives.

The Yic. Operatic Society is keeping the
Princess’s warm for a second week prior to the
Arnold advent. On Saturday last it reverted
to “ Les Cloches,” and did it pretty well con-
sidering the present lack of bone and beauty in
the amateur chorus. As a recruiting-ground for
Williamson and Musgrove the V.O.S. is just now
in a somewhat exhausted state, and the display of
limbs feminihe would call for condemnation all
round if Miss Maud Thornton hadn’t two redeem-
ing circumstances to stand upon. George Leopold,
who is always a sound, substantial miser, in “ Les
Cloches,” was the mainstay of Saturday’s show.
Mias Ray Jones made a neat little Germaine,
but her singing voice of late doesn’t amount to
much more than a clear enunciation of the words.
Miss Ida Osborne, as Serpolette, showed the
effects of influenza, or something, in her warble.
The amateur principals were J. Goudy and
M'Nichol Turner, who have been there before,
and Bonynge Kelly, a tall, slim young man of the
Family Herald type, who had not been there
before, but who sang pleasingly and behaved like
an intelligent Bonynge. It is hard upon an un-
ripe actor to be distinguished by such a fruity
name. Also, it is a terrible thing for James
Wade, an artistic tenor, to be cast for the part of
Grenicheux, who is incidentally referred to as an
Apollo among shrimp-catchers. Wade, in abbre-
viated knickers, only needs a pair of huge panto-
mime feet to make him funnier than the little
man who used to bathe in a small fish-pond at
Rickards’s.

Dampier is closing his chapter of horrors
at Melb. Bijou this week. On Saturday the bill
was “The Penalty of Crime,” an exceedingly
awful melodrama wherein the principal villain
went around chloroforming old men and maidens.
The brightest spot in the trouble was Master
Dampier, as a dishevelled youth named Jo.
Dampier Junior, at the early age of 15, promises
be an engaging young actor anon. To-night
(Thursday) and to-morrow “ A Convict Martyr ”
will bear his unjust sentence with resignation,
and after that the Bijou will take a rest for three
weeks.

Bland Holt, who never forgets to move
with, the times, is putting up another drama at
the Royal next Saturday. “ The White Heather,”
which is about the smartest of all the big shows
Bland has ever staged, will appeal to the public
on that occasion.

At the Opera House (where clever Marie
Lloyd and the unversatile Hurley will cease to
appear on August 8), a remarkably clever young
man, named Zobedie, is walking with his feet in
air. The same young man was a wondrous feature
of Wirth’s Circus a while ago, and his talent for
reversing the order of things in locomotion is now
more marked than ever. Another triumph of
youthful perseverance is Arnoldi, the juggler,
who performs some of Cinquevalli’s tricks very
neatly, and is doubtless superior to some of the
“ old man’s ” many imitators. But the difference
between Arnoldi and the strong, graceful, agile
juggler of yore is shown in the things that are
done as well as in the things that are left undone
by the newcomer.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
“ J.M.” (Kalgoorlie) : We said the office would
pay you whatever was due under your policy, it having
taken over the institution which issued the policy. Did
it not do this ? You must remember that you insured in
an institution with a declining business and a heavy
expense-rate, and which, in 1896, wrote off as lost, or set
aside to make provision for possible future losses, about
one-ninth of its total funds. The office which afterwards
took the concern over certainly didn’t undertake to make
good these losses, and you couldn’t expect your policy to
pan out so well as if you had gone into a more fortunate
concern at the first. Also, you don’t state what premium
you paid each year, what table you insured under, what
was the amount of your .policy, or what you got in settle-
ment. You surely don’t expect us to do anything large
and violent about your alleged grievance without any de-
tails of the grievance ?

The N.S.W. Auditor-General has just got out
his report for the year, Ist July, 1899, to 30th June, 1900,
and, as usual, he knocks the alleged surplus kite-high.
These are the figures given in Coghlan’s “ Seven
Colonies,” based on the Government's own returns :
Revenue (year to June, 1900).. .. £9,973,736
Expenditure (year to June, 1900) .. 9,811,402
Surplus .. .. .. .. £162,334
But after devoting the best part of a year to an overhaul
of the accounts, and a revelation of the wiles and devices
whereby the surplus is arrived at, the Auditor-General
produces this totally different result: —
Revenue (year to June, 1900).. .. £9,957,453
Expenditure (year to June, 1900) .. 10,191,174
Deficit £233,721
He also figures out that the accumulated deficit (not
reckoning the enormous shortage on the two superannua-
tion funds) increased from £2,757,529 in 1899 to £2,825,912
in 1900. And, as usual, the Government congratulates
the country on the “ highly satisfactory state of the
finances.”
* * * *
Westralia’s revenue for the year to 30th June,
1901, was £3,078,038, an increase of £202,642 as compared
with previous year, but the expenditure (swollen by
S’African contingents and interest on new debt) was
£3,165,244, a stupendous increase of £549,569. So instead
of a surplus of £259,721 as there was at June, 1900, there
is a deficit of £87,206.

The great and sudden improvement in earnings is set
down to better management of the bank’s Queensland
stations, and better prices obtained for cattle. The
bank’s N.S.W. stations have given no return at all ; a
great many of them are out in the West where the bones
of the dead banks lie, and in that graveyard of capital
there is no resurrection while the drought lasts. Even
now, the earnings only represent £ll9s. 6d. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds at the beginning of
the half-year, which is so low as to still suggest the neces-
sity of a very heavy writing down of assets to bring them
to their real present value. But, despite all these things,
it is the most promising balance-sheet the A.J.S. has
shown for some time.
During the half-year, the reconstructed deposits
have been further reduced by £69,285, through repur-
chase of “B ” deposits at a discount. The total recon-
structed deposits now stand at £5,232,309. Apparently,
however, the new business of the bank isn’t increasing.
It is only during the last two years that new deposits
have been shown separately, and the amounts were as
follows :
December, 1899. .£1,200,773 I December, 1900. .£1,179,605
June, 1900 .. 1,199,185 | June, 1901 .. 1,076,556
During the same period the reserve of cash and liquid
assets has also shown a steady decrease, the amounts
being :
December, 1899. .£1,556,824 I December, 1900. .£1,068,856
June, 1900 .. 1,150,054 | June, 1901 .. 912,274
Still the reserves are abundant, for the liabilities which
are not strictly tied up under the reconstruction scheme
are only about £1,400,000. But the signs are that the
process of realising the old dead securities is very slow,
and another 3s. 4d. in the £ of the “A” deposits falls
due on Ist January. Apparently it was the repayment of
the last instalment in January, 1900, which so greatly
reduced the cash reserves, and they haven’t grown since,
The A.J.S. Bank shows a great improvement so far as
concerns the increase in the reserves set down in the
balance-sheet, but it has a lot to do yet before it Will look
a solid and promising institution. The least satisfactory
feature of all is this

June, 1901 .. 6,927,530 143,081 4 2 7
The A.J.S. Bank has more funds invested and less money
lying idle than it had 18 months ago, yet the gross earn-
ings are rather less. A reduction in expenses and a
saving in ihterest through repayment of deposits have
increased the net receipts, but the assets don’t seem to
be yielding eveh So well as they did in December, ’99.
Yet the gross earnings are nearly £21,000 better thah last
half-year, when they stood at only £122,377. The note
circulation is also the lowest for a very long time—
another circumstance which doesn’t look like expahsioh.

The Ballarat Banking Co. (Ballarat, Victoria)

The earnings are equal to £4 17s. lOd. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds, as compared with £4
12s. Bd. per cent, for half-year to 31/12/1900. The Ballarat
Banking Co. has a paid-up capital of £85,000, so its
reserves are very solid by comparison. During the last
half-year deposits have decreased a little, total deposits
for the last six half-years being as follows :
December, 1898 £212,677 June, 1900 .. £230,293
June, 1899 .. 215,877 December, 1900 235,240
December, 1899 218,903 June, 1901 .. 225,644
Cash and Government and municipal securities are
£73,670, being nearly 33 per cent, of all liabilities to the
public. The point where the Ballarat Banking Co. is safe
beyond the average of banks is that the shareholders’
funds (£145,484) are unusually large in proportion to the
liabilities to the public (£225,644) ; the advances would
have to depreciate by 40 per cent, before the securities of
depositors could be endangered. Even in such a mag-
nificent institution as the Bank of N.S.W. shareholders’
funds bear so much smaller a proportion to outside
liabilities that if the advances depreciated about 20 per
cent, it would exhaust the capital and reserves, and leave
the depositors with no margin of security.
The Ballarat Banking Co. is the only surviving
Australian bank which has its headquarters in a pro-
vincial town, and which exists as a protest against the
tendency to centralise all banking business in the
metropolis of each State. There was once in N.S.W. a
Bank of Bathurst with a paid-up capital of £4500, and the
Bank of North Queensland was at first a country institu-
tion with its headquarters at Townsville, but now the
Ballarat Banking Co. is the only bank on the mainland
which has its existence outside the big, all-devouring
capital cities.

In 1895 the bank overdraft had swelled to nearly £63,000,
and in order to pay this off the co. borrowed £lOO,OOO on
debentures at 5 per cent., which was a lamentably high
price to pay for money, especially as £8596 of it went in
flotation expenses, so that the money obtained really costs
£5 9s. sd. per cent. The co. also owes £47,020 on mort-
gage of its hotels, so it is trading on £132,135 of its own
money and £147,000 of other people’s. Also, it would
appear that there is still depreciation to be provided
for, and considering this and the top-heavy mass of
borrowed money the Castlemaine Brewery Co., despite its
greatly increased earnings, and the fact that it again has
a reserve, needs to go very slow in the matter of dividends
for a long while to come.

The policy-holders may not be making anything very
great, but the shareholders are certainly doing well
enough. About a year ago the total policies still in force
amounted to only £156,895, so if the assets are really
worth their face value the co. could pay all its policies at
once, and return the shareholders their capital of £40,000
three or four times over. The co. could do this even if
it received no more premiums, and it is still receiving
£4264 per annum from this source. Meanwhile, the
policy-holders are enjoying 25 per cent, dividends on
their capital of £40,000, and their average for the last
eight years has been 16 per cent. There is certainly
money in the proprietary life assurance business, if
worked as the Victoria has worked it.

At Dec., 1900, it was stated that “Your directors have
applied the surplus”—£774—“ after providing for work-
ing expenses, dividend, &c., to the further reduction of
debts of a doubtful nature,” so this writer naturally in-
cluded that amount in the sums written off, and showed
the reserves remaining as £7665. It now appears, how-
ever, that the £774 wasn’t written off but carried for-
ward, which somewhat alters the position.
The gross income of the Mont de Pi4t6 has
steadily increased during the past three half-years, but
expenses have increased also, and more than swallowed
up the surplus. The increase, however, isn’t in the
direction of salaries, which have rather diminished.
Here are the figures :

growing more severe in the money-lending industry, as in
all others.

An enormous business run on insufficient capital is
apparently the trouble with Swallow and Ariell, and the

draft eats up the profits. It is apparently with a view to
gradually shifting these burdens that the dividends are
kept so iow.

alities about a group of mines on which something like
£500,000 has already been spent in railway communication,
etc.!! It is too appalling. Adelaide Critic says, “ But the
shares must be worth more than 12s. or else somebody
has been nicely fooled.” Well, as the Critic puffed these
shares when they were three times the present price, it
must admit either that it was nicely fooled or that it has
nicely fooled its readers. Writer has seen a draft pros-
pectus of 10 years ago, when an attempt (that failed) Was
made to float the Chillagoe mines on a basis of £150,000.
Also the original report, in which the whole group were
condemned on the ground that they were too scattered
and individually too small; none had any depth or
appearance of permanence, and the big formations were
far too poor. That seems to be the position to-day, and
it would have taken a big transformation to have
altered it.

Chillagoe Railway and Mines : Stewart has
arrived from China, but has been too indisposed to go on
the mine yet. He will be accompanied there by Danvers
Power, who is to make an independent estimate and
assay of the ore bodies. The directors have returned to
Melbourne, and the shares continue to fall, touching 10s.
in London a few days ago. Of course Australia followed
suit. _ If writer had his way he would give the board a
bad time. He has reason to believe that practically all
the unsatisfactory information furnished some two
months ago by Weinberg was given to directors last year.
And, by the way, why hasn’t the full text of Weinberg’s
report been published ? The report must have been re-
ceived nearly two months ago, and meanwhile shares
have fallen by over 50 per cent. Whether any official
took advantage of it or not, the glaring and ghastly fact
remains that there was the opportunity. It is about time
that the remaining scrippers should know the names of
original shareholders who managed to creep out during
the Chillagoe boom. The publication of a list of the pre-
sent registered owners with that of, say, a year ago would
be a more interesting document than the newspaper
encouragement of “ satisfactory developments” which the
public receive with their daily bread. It will take some-
thing more than any report of Mr. Danvers Power to re-
establish confidence in this inflated concern.

paid for many a year ; and the shares have fallen to 785.,
the lowest they have touched also for many a year. Is it
all on account of shortness of water, or falling off in gold,
or the sale of large numbers of shares in a recently-de-
ceased’s estate, or the simultaneous combination of all
three ?
•* * * *
Woodlark Island: Another start without fail
promised, also a better clean-up. Ore admitted to be
very variable in value, and selection impossible. “ You
will see by the assay-sheets that the ore we have been
working is not high-class, but it has all to come out.”
The assays vary from a few dwts. to 2Joz., and the richest
is in pug from which it is hard to extract. Paid-up shares,
7s. 4d. sellers ; contributing, 3s. : no buyers of either.

At the end of Dec. last there were 7010 men
working in and on the Broken Hill mines, besides 2562
working at co.’s smelters, &e., off the mines. By June 30
the number had come down to 5856 in and on the mines,
the smelter-hands, &c.. remaining about the same. Since
June 30 another 500 have been thrown out. This is how
what are known as the “ northern group—that is, the
mines north of the B.H. Proprietary—stand :
Dec. 31 July 26
Block 14 ... 796 .. 440
British .. .. 560 ... 47
Junction .. .. 622 .. 4
Junction North .. 250 .. 6
North .. .. 234 .. 36
The mines south of the B.H. Prop., as well as the B.H.
Prop, itself, have, however, been absorbing some of these,
otherwise the aggregate position would be much worse.
And the unfortunate at Broken Hill who is out of work,
is out of work, and about 300 miles from the chance of
any
* « ♦ *
Block 10 has also dismissed close upon 200 men,
and probably would have sent more adrift but for its con-
tract to supply the Metal Co. with concentrates. The
mill is now shut down a third of its time during the
day shift (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.), so that experimental work
may the better be carried on. Block 10’s position differs
from that of the Central (Sulphide Corporation) and the
South. The two latter have big bodies of average-grade
ore, fairly uniform ; their best chance, therefore, is to de-
crease costs by increasing output. Block 10, on the other
hand, has ore of a much more varied character ; it’s best
chance is to pick out the richer ore. But of course that
makes it more difficult to handle the mine later on.
* • * *
According to what look like good advices lead is
going lower ; a rapid recovery to about £l2 10s. is then
foreshadowed. The same advices state that there is little
likelihood of an improvement for silver.
* * » *
Before, when lead got down below £ll (the
lowest the B.H. Prop, ever sold any for was in ’94, when
one parcel went for £9), the number of workmen got
down to 4290. That was at the end of ’95,- just before the
sulphide mills were started; In most cases they got to
work first on their richer and Softer sulphides ; the great
improvements made since in means of extraction have
barely kept pace with the depreciation in the quality of
the ore available. There is, however, wide scope for
further improvement. Hardly any of the mills take out
half of the silver; most of them only a little more
than one-third. Two-thirds of the lead is the
usual thing ; the other third, like the half of
the silver, goes away with the waste. Of the zinc—the
ores average 18 per cent, zinc—nothing is made ; on the
contrary, the co’s are debited if they leave it in the con-
centrates. The British qre contains, per ton, metal worth,
it is estimated, £6 Is. at present prices. It has been
getting only £2 2s. worth out. The other £3 19s. is there
for the expert ore-dresser to fish for. Moreover, it is in
ore which is not only broken and raised to surface, but is
crushed fine and lying alongside a railway. Plenty of the
stuff—hundreds of thousands of tons of it—is far richer
than that at the British mine. Of course, a problem with
such millions in it is attracting many experimentalists.
Two or three German co’s have experts at work in elabo-
rately-equipped surroundings. Nine-tenths of the effort
is, however, towards magnetic separation.
* * ■* *
B.H. Prop, has issued its half-yearly report—
Dec. 1 to May 31. Profit, £87,579 ; while £120,000 has
heen paid away in divs. And the profit ought not to be
stated at so much as £87,579 either, though that is a
heavy fall, because only £14,926 has been allowed for
depreciation, whereas the average allowance is over
£30,000 —in the half-year to Nov. 1900, it was £40,953.
What with building the iron-flux line to the Iron Knob
mine, and also the coke ovens at Bellambi, construction
expenses have this half-year been very heavy; and
through that and the payment of this £120,000 div., the
excess of liquid assets over liabilities-has been reduced by
£93,056. Certainly the co. doesn’t say it is quite as bad
as that, because the report takes credit for £24,000 which
it still includes in the reserve fund, thought it has been
spent on the flux tramway. To make a profit of £102,505
gross, or £87,579 net (according to the directors’ reckon-
ing), 296,389 tons ore was handled. This compares with
recent half-years like this (in order to show the increase
in the proportion of sulphides treated a column is added) :
Gross Ore , , .
Profit. Raised.

May, 1898 £177,567 204,731 72,685
Nov., 1898 152,876 204,067 77,280
May, 1899 142,180 202,693 108,382
Nov., 1899 144,492 206,193 117,996
May, 1900 129,576 232,487 163,993
Nov., 1900 167,795 293,451 210,808
May, 1901 102,505 296,389 231,869
From £167,795 to £102,505 is an awkward fall; but, seeing
that the co. averaged £3 11s. 6d. less for its lead in the
latter than in the former term, and a small fraction less
for its silver (metallic lead production, 27,869 tons ; ditto
silver, 3,009,1640 z.), it might easily have been a lot worse.
In fact, the co. has dodged about two-thirds of the bump
by getting out rather better ore, by reducing the cost of
quarrying (the open-cuts are about finished, so there
hasn’t been much batter to make in worthless country
rock), and by improvements in both concentrating and
smelting. The effect of the small reduction in freights
(the S.A. Govt, allows Is. and the Silverton Tramway 00.
2d. per ton), of the new iron-flux line, and of the new
coke works (these last will supply only half of the co.’s
requirements) have not yet been felt. At present
special efforts are being made to increase the capacity
of the smelting furnaces, and to reduce the cost of
haulage from the mine faces underground to the mill
(electric traction is being tried underground instead of
horses).
* • • *
B.H. Proprietary doesn’t say what its silver and
lead averaged—only says that they averaged so much
more (or less) than they did some other time, when they
averaged so much more (or less) than they did at some
other time, when they averaged—&c. Highest and
lowest lead quotations for the half year (to May 31) were
£l6 12s. 6d. and £l2 Is. 3d., though the former was for
only a brief space in the opening weeks ; still the average
was probably brought up to somewhere near £l3. And
as the price during the last few weeks has been anything
from £l2 2s. 6d. to £l2 65., this means a considerable
further bump ; in itself quite as big a bump as economies
now in hand can make up for.

Some B. H. Prop, figures (those in brackets are

It has been persistently rumored that wages at
Broken Hill are to be reduced 10 per cent., and thereafter
raised on a sliding scale. All that has happened so far is
an ostensibly unofficial suggestion made by shift-bosses
that that would be better than having a mine shut down.

N.S.W. diamonds : The Elliott Co. seems to be
doing the most profitable work in the State, making an
actual profit of £1338 this year, chiefly on account of the
rise in price. The highest last year was 16s. per carat,
and an offer of 255. 6d. for the 500 carats on hand was
refused t’other day. Stated that many years profitable
work is practically in sight.

London and Globe Finance Co. : More start-
ling revelations cabled—the transfer of 200,000 West le
Roi shares at par, ex div., at a time when the West le
Roi Co. had five undeveloped claims costing 38,000d015.,
representing issues of capital equal to £437,000. It then
paid to the British .American Corporation the sum of
£200,000 by giving a half-interest in five claims costing
38,000d015. This has come on top of finding the whole of
the securities pledged for £500,000 borrowed and lost in
the Lake View slump, £425,000 in loans still outstanding,
and the total claims of unsecured creditors exceeding a
million. Yet, when the mail left, the British Austra-
lasian, and other London financial journals, were still
clamoring for the voluntary liquidation of this awful con-
cern—the B.A. urging that Whittaker Wright had made
a lot of money for his friends in other directions, that he
should not be blamed for one big failure, and that, unfor-
tunately, he was a man who was unable to distinguish
between well-meaning friends and incipient blackmailers.
Compulsory liquidation is in England a severe process,
and generally makes it quite clear how the milk got out
of the cocoa-nut.
* * * *
Perseverance: “The additional furnaces will
not arrive on the mine before Oct. or Nov. The founda-
tions, however, are being prepared, and no time will be
lost in the erection of the roasters when they do come to
hand. With the whole plant in full running order, the
Perseverance will probably be in a position to declare a
monthly output of 15,0000 z., and so far as the mine’s ores
are concerned this high yield can be easily maintained.”
That is the picture of the future. The present position of
the mine was revealed at the annual meeting of share-
holders held in London recently—that £llO,OOO had been
borrowed for the sulphide plant, and although Jhat has
been running nearly a year, only half the debt has been
cleared off. No div. was declared, but it was admitted
that the total cost of mining and milling the sulphidejore
was £3 Iss. per ton, including everything. There is also
reason to believe that the bulk value of the sulphide ore
in this mine is under 25dwt. per ton. To put the
average up to ljoz. an undue proportion of the work
must take place on the rich shutes, the effect of which
will be seen when they come back to the poorer ore to
square up the stopes. Already the rich shute of ore on
the Lake View boundary has helped this mine a good
deal. There is an immense amount of ore above the
500 ft. level it is true, but there is a great deal of it under
an oz. That it is variable in value is proved by the bulk
of the ore coming close to the Lake View boundary im-
mediately under the big open cut. That is where the
best oxidised ore came from, and, of course, it is an
established fact that the ore below in the sulphide zone
is correspondingly good. The Perseverance is un-
doubtedly an expensively worked big mine, the shares of
which are too big a price. As there seems no hope of
making any material reduction of working expenses,
divs. must be few and far between.
* * ¥ *
Boulder Main Reef: “A further decline in
these shares is a mystery as well as a disappointment to
Australian holders.” From this, it may be assumed that
the failure to strike pay-ore in the bottom level is a
matter of detail. The decline is no mystery to anyone
who has the slightest knowledge of the business. Unfor-
tunately, few men who write of mines and mining
markets in Australia ever went down a mine or held a
share, and the public have to put up with their ignorance.
* * * *
Oroya: At last this mine has made what looks
like an important development. The diamond drill re-
mained in lode matter for 20ft., and the average of the
full core is given at Boz. “ There is now no shadow of
doubt that the sensationally rich shute of ore worked by
the Associated Northern extends well into the Oroya
ground.” Also said that the ore discloses the same
characteristics as the ore from the other mine.
* * • *
Long Tunnel Extended (Vic.): Resolution to
amalgamate with the Long Tunnel mine negatived, and
the chairman said the question of taking proceedings
against that co. for loss caused by flooding the Extended
works would receive attention. Amalgamation not likely
to take place under these circumstances. The erstwhile
great market value of each mine has vanished almost
utterly, and while the fall of the parent co. has been the
greater, the management of the Extended should kick
themselves, or be kicked, for refusing to sell the mine at
a price that will never be offered again.
* * * * j
South German G.M. (Vic.) sold recently at
425. per share. When The Bulletin, some two or three
years ago, published the truth about the South German
outlook, and the directors came to the rescue with re-
assuring reports, shares were marketable at £7. By the
way, one of the S.G. directors—Gray of Maldon—was sent
into Vic. Leg. Council lately.

Queensland mining accidents for 1900 were
numerous. Total, 109 casualties ; 18 fatal. The Towers
was responsible for 35 accidents; seven fatal. These
figures do not include coal-mining accidents. Banana-
land’s coal industry employs 1210 miners, and was respon-
sible for the handsome total of 23 casualties, including
nine fatalities, for 1900. Five men were killed at one
time through the old trouble—naked lights, &c.

Newcastle’s trade figures for the six months to
June 30 were phenomenal. Though the export of coal
advanced only 185,532 tons (from 1,383,033 to 1,568,565),
its value bounded from £508,274 to £772,147. No wonder
the miner kept on asking, “ Where do I come in I ”

How they mine at Bendigo. The New Moon
Co. has crushed 159,677 tons in the 9j years to 30th June,
1901. The gold recovered averaged barely Bdwt. per ton.
Yet it paid £108,600 in dividends (average t'11,432 per
annum) on a total called-up capital of £11,560.
tically 100 per cent, per annum out of Bdwt. rock. Co. also'
spent out of earnings, £19,107 on machinery'. There have
been no calls for 11 years. Last half-year the average
got down below 6dwt. per ton, and there was also a slight
falling oft in the output of stone as compared with 1900,
yet the dividends were £66oo—at the rate of £13,200 per
annum or 114 per cent. If the New Moon was English-
owned its whole output would hardly pay the expenses of
the London office.
* * * *
Dredging in itself is a good enough game in
suitable places—always provided that the man who pays
the calls stands by and cleans up his own gold. That is
the fly in the ointment. It is not necessarily the wash
that declares the dividend —it is the manager, whose
power is, in this matter, absolute.

The best foreign customer for Newcastle coal is
now Chili ; last half-year it took 221,202 tons. After
that, Sandwich Islands (121,257), and U. States third
(74,585). But of all customers Vic. is the be5t—397,175
tons last half-year.

The Waxcellent Madden seems to have
tripped over his own moustache in his eagerness
to bite Royalty’s ear for that baronetcy. Madden,
the Chief Justice, who is expected to be a sound
lawyer, appeals, on a point of constitutional law,
to Judas Chamberlain, and is duly notified by
cable: “ Adoption of seizure by His Majesty’s
Govt, as an Act of State” (proposed by Madden)
“ would not help, if no local authority to seize.
Defence of Act of State not available against British
subject.” Regarded altogether, and especially the
last sentence, Chamberlain’s message seems to
say, “What the devil is all the fuss about if, as
you say, the paper has no influence?”

Queensland Government, taking a leaf
from the N.S.W. book, is sending round a
memo, to the post-and-telegraph officers in the
Northern State, demanding subscriptions for the
weary memorial to Queen Victoria (who is think-
ing of Queen Victoria now ?) Of course the cir-
cular doesn’t say one must give, but it is signed
by the permanent head of the P.O. Dept., and
his official title is under his name in big print. A
communication of this sort from tiie Deputy-
P.M.G. to his underlings is not a request ; it is
similar to a Royal invitation to sing or play at
Windsor Castle —no compulsion, but Will
any of the recipients of these stand-and-
deliver circulars have the backbone to send
them back to 'the D.P.M.G. by return
post ?
SHOPPING WITH THE
MISSUS,
“ John, if you had a spark of manhood you’d

Shortly after Queen Victoria’s death
Hobart Mercury started a memorial fund with
£lO raised in the office; but despite frantic
appeals to the loyalty of the Tassies —which the
Mercury boasts is of a higher order than that of
any other State —the fund is still less than £lOO.
Either the Raspberrylanders are not as loyal as
they’re cracked up to be, or they think that pro-
prietor Davies having been made a C.M.G. the
object of the fund is achieved. George tried
hard to get his memorial fund amalgamated with
the Tasmanian Soldiers’ Memorial Fund which
amounted to some hundreds, but the subscribers
to the latter firmly declined to allow that sort
of Tambaroora, and the burly Mayor almost
weeps as he looks at his fund slowly crawling up
to a century in this fashion :

Hennessey, with an assortment of distended fol-
lowers, has asked N S.W. Premier See to pay
£335, the deficit resulting from the operations of
the gorgeous Sydney citizens’ ducal celebration
committee. And the Premier (no doubt afraid of
being called a “ pro-Boer ” if he refused), instead
of bluntly telling S.H. and co. to go and pay then
own Crawl-bill, says he thinks the Treasury ought
to stump up the amount, seeing that the event
was “ the greatest in the history of the country ! ”
But perhaps it really was so regarded by everyone
who had his eye firmly glued on a K.C. M.G.-ship.

Again the sordid, squalid squabble about

have ordered them, and the Commonwealth and
State Ministers are being chased all over Smell-
bourne by debt collectors. Probably another case
in which some facile personage waved his fat hand
in a large, airy way, and said “Do the thing pro-
perly.” Any nuniber of people seem to have
waved their hands over the ducal celebration, but

According to Melb. Age, Queen Alexandra
has set a fashion in babies by driving abroad with
one of her grandchildren on her knee. The result
is most surprising. Babies are now almost as
fashionable as dogs, and ladies of ton are actually
borrowing them for decorative purposes when

The stale imported Chinese egg is now
very largely consumed in N.S.W., and to a
less degree in some other States. It is
said that the importers could profitably
sell these eggs in Sydney at 4d. per
dozen. One merchant states that he
got a letter t’other day from Hong-
kong offering eggs at that port at
Id. and 2d. per dozen. The egg
industry is worth about £500,000
per annum in N.S.W. If no
steps are taken, it will soon be
practically monopolised by the
Chow with his cheap chilled
egg laid by an overworked
heathen hen.

“William B. Burgess,

port her. In this age of decreasing
birth-rate, surely such a woman should
receive recognition from the State.

got a pair. Also dozens of policemen got auto-

Not the least noticeable man in the Duke’s
suite was the venerable-looking Vic. Police-
Inspector John Mitchell Christie. Wherever the
Duke or Duchess, went there was Christie not
three yards off. If it was in the open air, he wore
a black overcoat, with a velvet collar, and a silk
hat with a mourning-band. If it was at an evening
function he was in evening dress, and the wonder
ife that he wasn’t disguised in a bogus “order.”
As it was, lots of people wanted to know if he
was Private Secretary Bigge, or Wenlock, the
head of the household. At the Hobart review
Christie got into close quarters with Rev. Boss
Woollnough, M.P., who had his Army Chaplain’s
things on. Christie thought Mr. W. w'as an
Inspector of Police, and was rather cut up that
the latter didn’t pay his respects to him, although
they were sometimes shoulder to shoulder. At

last Christie asked a pressman who the old swell
was. “ A parson,” was the answer. “ Great
Scott! ” said Christie “ I was going to ask him for
the loan of a pair of handcuffs ! ”
The Yorks carried the “ signed-portrait ” busi-
ness to such an extent in Tasmania that some
people won’t own-up that they have got any. One
man who had aprominent part in the reception and
who, at the very least, was expected to get a silver
cigarette-case, landed the current photo, only.
But no, he never mentions it! A man who lent
his horses got a pair of sleeve-links, but another
who lent his carriage, and was paid for it, had to
go without even a photo.

Victorian tax-payers will get a shock
when they are presented with the bill for fitting
up the Exhibition-building as a State Parliament
House. There is no doubt that the money spent
on decorating the dome and main hall for the
reception of York, and the fittings for the State
Parliament House, will run into a sum which
would have been sufficient to complete the
Parliament House in Spring-street. Members
have pressed the Govt, to put them up most
sumptuously. There are rooms not only for
every half-dozen members who choose to call them-
selves a party, but there are rooms for nearly
every one of the members of both chambers.
The corridors are elaborately fitted with costly
chairs and lounges, and carpeted with beautiful
scarlet material. The estimate given for the
work originally was £30,000 but when all accounts
are footed the sum will not be far short of £70,000.
What is to be done with the fittings when the
Federal Parliament leaves Melbourne no one
can say, least of all the Peacock Government.

At present Victoria is paying the interest on
the cost of, and the upkeep of, three gubernatorial
houses. The agreement between the Govt, and
the Federal Govt, re the upkeep of Government
House, where Hopetoun reigns, has not been
signed. A few weeks ago the Vic. Govt, rushed
into a heavy expenditure in the purchase of an
enormous place at Malvern for the State Gover-
nor’s residence. Except for a few rats and an old
butler the Malvern palace is empty. Then there
is the Mt. Macedon house, which costs a good
sum annually to keep in order. By the way, the
Peacock Govt, has decided that the Macedon
house is not to be maintained in future for State
Governors. So far it has not been decided what
is to be done with it. It looks, at present, as if it
is to become a white elephant. There is just a
chance of the State Governor, when appointed,
renting the Macedon house, but seeing the trouble
there is over that official’s pay, the chance seems
small. By the way, great pressure is being:
brought to bear on Vic. Govt, to increase the
Governor’s Wages by allowing him a private sec.
and an A.D.C.

Launceston (Tasmania) is decorated just
now with a large mare’s nest about a lost noble-
man. Ten years ago (in June, 1891) a certain
Samuel Cox died in the local Benevolent Asylum,
his age being incredibly stated at 105, also at 117.
Probably he was 85 or 90 or thereabouts. The
legend is that his real name was Jervis, and that
he was the son of a large English landowner at
Lichfield. He went voyaging in a vessel called
the Regent Fox, with a naval uncle who cast him
ashore in Tasmania long before there was
any white settlement, consequently he lived
with the aborigines for 40 years. The naval
uncle thus became heir to the estates, won the
great sea battle of Cape St. Vincent, became Earl
St. Vincent, and lived rich and respected for
many years on the property he had “shook ” from
boy Samuel. Samuel, in the unexplainable
fashion of such wanderers, never claimed the pro-
perty, though it seems to be alleged that he told
the tale of his aristocratic descent occasionally
in public-houses and other places. The toughest
discrepancy lies in the fact that John Jervis won
the battle Which made him Earl St. Vincent in
1797, 94 years before Samuel died, and had been
in the West Indies for at least three years
before 1797, and as it was previous to this
that he marooned Samuel in Tasmania, that per-
son’s Australian career must have spread over
about 100 years. Apparently, by his own account,
he could have been only about five years old when
he was in the navy, and an unfeeling relative cast
him ashore. All the same, the managemenf of
Launceston Benevolent Asylum takes the matter
very seriously indeed, and proposes to recover the
cost of Samuel’s maintenance out of the. alleged
“ estate ” which should have come to him if it
hadn’t been for the sins of the uncle aforemen-
tioned in the century before last.

Dr. Koch’s opinion, expressed at the
London Tuberculosis Conference, that infection to
human beings through eating diseased meat and
drinking diseased milk was extremely rare, is
being vigorously controverted, and will lead to a
long and interesting discussion. Here, indeed, is
a field wherein some young earnest Australian
doctor may win fame. If consumption and cancer
aren’t spread here by diseased-meat food it isn’t
because of the absence of diseased meat. A coun-
try medico the other day wrote to a Sydney paper
stating that he had cut cancer from corned beef
at his own table, and that he had found a big bag
of tuberculous matter in a roast leg of mutton
served up to him at dinner.
There was something very sad in the an-
nouncement of Mrs. Goe’s age. Sixty-two ! The
Bishop of Melbourne’s wife belonged to the order
of good women who seem to think that their first
duty in life is to look old, and who in their well-
meaning way tend to make the worldly ones more
worldly. Mrs. Goe was only 48, it seems, when
she first came to Melbourne. A photograph of
the new arrival at that period . shows her to
have been quite agedly disposed, from the crown
of her bonnet downwards. Why do the wives of
the clergy make a point of looking as though they
never were young? It offers no encouragement
for other women to get born again, and it certainly
doesn’t tempt male sinners to. marry into the
Christian Endeavour set. What religion wants is
a jaunty, peroxided sisterhood in prettily-built
frocks who will advocate the bringing of inward
spiritual grace to the surface, as much as possible.

At a very fashionable Northern wedding
last week (the bride was 34 and the groom 60) the
organist played, as a voluntary, “When we are

Belle of New York.” And next day some incensed
clerics of same denomination protested hotly
against a set piece “Rock of Ages,” being ex-
hibited in a draper’s window. Said it was
sacrilege.

Many Sydney landlords, being called u pon
to pay about 3d. extra rates on a small house at
10s. a week, have cheerfully put up the rent to
15s. or so, solemnly assuring the tenant that the
whole ss. was wanted to cover the extortionate
new charges of the City Council. Even good
pious landlords are doing this sort of thing.
Apart from any moral disadvantages about being
such a degraded variety of liar, how about the
criminal aspect of the matter ? The Bulletin
would like to see a test case tried to find out if
this isn’t getting money under false pretences.
Of course a landlord can demand ss. a week more
rent if he likes; that isn’t criminal. But de-
manding ss. is one thing and persuading the
tenant to pay it by false representations is
another.

Oxford-street, Sydney, will see a thril-

and 6 p.m. the steam trams for Waverley and
Paddington are simply rushed by a crowd of
passengers eager to get home, and they crowd the
footboards much as was the custom at Common-
wealth time.' Then , drivers were careful and
went slow, but these trams in the evening (some
are throughs) travel at top speed and one night
the wheel of a ’bus will get close enough and
scoop the clustered footboards of three swiftly-
moving cars. It has nearly happened more than
once already.

The Royal Commission on sweating has
taken some Valuable evidence back to Melbourne
re sweating in the Sydney tailoring trade. One
of the witnesses deposed as to the rates paid by
his firm, and then, with humility in his heart,
went to a mass-meeting of the sweated women-
workers, and told them he was shocked to say his
evidence, he had since found out, was “incor-
rect ” ; his bosses’ books had disclosed that a still
lower rate was paid than that to which he swore.
“It was the last straw to break the camel’s back,
and he had resigned.” Melbourne Commission take

to the boss having a fish-trap

heard “ Wot’ll try—fried fish

“ Fish, most decidedly.” When
the boss sat down the boarders
remarked suspiciously: “Fish,

The boss ate his meal in silence.
A couple of months afterwards
we heard of those boarders.

They must have curious ideas of comets
in Sydney D.T. office. Thus their correspondent:
OROOKWELL, Tuesday.—A very remarkable comet
was observed here this morning. It was forked-shaped,
and made its appearance at about 4 o’clock on the NAV.
horizon. It appeared to be very close to the earth, and
was travellling at a tremendous pace towards the sun.
That scientific touch of “travelling towards the
sun” deceived the night-editor. 4-s the comet
appeared in the West and the sun in the East the
former must certainly have been going at a terrific
bat. Had the object really been a comet, its rate
of speed, if worked out, would have surprised the
correspondent. Of course the apparition was a
common meteor.

Dear Bulletin.— -The attention paid by
the Peacock Govt, to the morals of the Vic. old-
age pensioner is truly marvellous. Not far from
Omeo, a bedridden woman, aged 86, and her male
partner, a year or two younger —though quite
destitute —were refused a pension, on the ground
that they were occupying the same house without
having been married. However, the difficulty
has been got over by the humanity of a clergyman
and a lawyer, who rode 80 miles to marry the old
couple. Such hypocritical quibbling as this stirs
up the gall in anybody who remembers the shame-
ful waste of coin that lias been going on in Mel-
bourne for the past 12 months, while worthy
people are starving.—J.P.C.

British newspaper phrases: “The dull

A Melbourne suburb is in spasms, all over
a harmless, necessary constable. One night lately
the local senior officer failed to do his “round,
and law’norder very nearly broke down in conse-

high and low, and were finally thinking of run-
ning in the whole population on a charge of
“ concealing a senior officer in the execution of his
jooty,” when it occurred to some, one to search
the watch-house. Arriving there they heard a
great riot proceeding from a cell, where a casual
drunk was protesting against being disturbed in
his sleep by the outcries of the lost senior and the
watch-house keeper. They had been escorting
the over-loaded one to his couch when the door
slammed; and for four long cold hours two
large policemen had been raising Cain in
an endeavor to attract the attention of Constable
Decimal Ten, who was sleeping some 20ft. away.
Policeman Decimal Ten said he heard the row,
but took it to be an unsober prisoner with an
attack of fantods, so he simply turned over and
snored some more. For this alleged neglect of
duty he was transferred to the city. And now the
residents are pleading to have their policeman
back again. They say he has a beautiful snore
and his dreamy countenance is as soothing as a
brick dropped on a worm, and they won’t be
happy till they get him.

Dear Bulletin. —Be N.S.W. teachers’
salaries. B. R. Wise was “on the solidest of
ground ” all right. Writer knows a map, with a
big family, getting £9l a year, which princely
screw his wife has to supplement by cpoking for
shearers. This lucky fellow has been in the ser-
vice only 29 years.—Hagram.
Despite war and hysteria, Maoriland does
pot lose sight of progressive and useful legislation.
A., important measure, for instance, is the Tes-
tators’ Family Maintenance Act of last
session. Prior to the passing of-that Act,
a will could not be upset unless undue
influence or duress could be proved.} Now,
, however, should a testator omit—no
\ matter from wliat cause—to make
\ proper provision out of his estate
\ for those whom, if he were alive,
' he would be bound to support,
the aggrieved party or parties
may apply to the Supreme
Court for an order to have
reasonable provision made.
Since the Act became law
one case has been determined
under its provisions. A man
died, leaving only £2OO for
his widow out- of an estate of
£l5OO, and in spite of the op-
position of distant relatives
who would benefit by the will
as it stood, the court ordered
that she should receive £1 per
week for her lifetime. About
the justice and common-sense of the
Act there can be no doubt what-
ever. The l&w compels a man to
support his wife out of his estate
while he is alive, quite regardless
of the fact that he may want the
estate himself for drink or other pur-
poses. Why, then, should she not have
an equal claim on the same estate when
he is dead and doesn’t want, the estate
himself, either for drink or.other objects—
or, at least, when he can’t- use. it, how-
ever much he wants it for drink ? Also,
why should a corpse have powers that
the live man doesn’t possess? If any
man has a grievance against his wife
which is good enough to entitle him
to refuse her further maintenance,
he should demonstrate the fact in
the law-courts while he is yet alive.
When he takes a mean posthumous re-
venge by leaving the woman unprovided
for, there is always the risk that she
will become a burden on the State, and the
State has enough burdens without paying
for any dead man’s grudge.

If the R.C. conscience had a reasonable
sense of humour it could enjoy the Melb. Age

the thing properly all the same ; 150 members in
full regalia proceshed to a Presbyterian taber-
nacle. The leaders bore the Bible and two un-
sheathed swords, and took up prominent positions
under the pulpit, which had a Union-Jack in
froiit of it. On the walls of the House of God
were placards reminding the worshippers of
Boyne and other improving battles. And the
choir received valuable assistance from Mr. and
Miss Moy Ling, as though the function weren’t
yellow enough and funny enough without intro-
ducing a Chinese element.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, July 29, 1901.
My Dear Arini,—
Opening of Parliament is ever and always
described as “ a brilliant function.” It may be
very red-and-gold and instrumentally brazen in
lands where kings and things open the corrob-
boree. But in Australia there is no superior
ceremony, save perhaps
inMelb., where President Zeal’s tea puts—or used
to put a glittering tail to the Parliamentary kite.
The first N.S.W. Parliament since the inaugur-
ation of the Australian Commonwealth, opened
on Wednesday last week by Acting-Gover-
nor Darley, was about as brilliant as a fog-bank.
And it was all over while you’d be making
two pancakes. There was nothing to see—even if
the dressing had been worth viewing the Council
Chamber was too dark for any but cats’ eyes.
C.C. was crammed with women all wearing warm
clothes and a de profundi* demeanor. They re-
minded me of that party in the parlor, all silent
and all—(bad word). Enter the stately “ Looten-
nant-Guvner ” (as American residents call him) at-
tended by his son, Capt. Darley, and another young
A.D.C., Captain Watt, with thin, ’possumy legs
left undraped by his Highland skirt. Soon as
members of the Lower House were yarded (the
space in which they were wedged is insufficient by
law for any travelling stock), the A.G. read The
Speech, with its good old familiar wheezes about
noxious weeds, rabbit-pest, and female suffrage.
These things I think have been in every Aus-
tralian Governor’s speech for years, and you may
know by the alteration in the reader’s voice if he
be personally in favor of the last. Gov. Dailey
hurried over the clause in a way that suggested
it wasn’t a chocolate-cream on his tongue.
Rosehill Races on Saturday brought out very
few women, but shoals of men. The day was
“princely,” as Olive Schreiner has it —windless
and clear. And as the males gathered in solid
crowds in the betting-paddock between each
event, little serpents of blue smoke hung above
each man. Not enough breeze to blend the spirals
into a cloud. No smoke without fire —in the
centre of the pack was a woman with a flame-
colored toque. She fitted somewhat into the
proverb-picture, especially as she was making
things warm for Mr. o’i.Vlelcliisedeck over an
alleged “little bit ” on Chippy Norton.
Concerning fire: the sward on the straight
nearly opposite the grand-stand was on fire
through a lighted match, and you’d scarcely
believe what a good blaze that short crop of
winter grass made. Violet dressing was still in
abundance, but the flowers themselves were not
there, save on Miss Palotta. She wore a
large bunch, and her big feathered hat,
and the very newest things in neck-gear—the
pelerine. Ruffles have gone out, Paris fashion-
arbiters say. Grace’s pelerine was of white satin,
with far-apart black spots, and edged with swans-
down. Her muff was huge and of the same
materials. There was a plain skirt with a, long
plain coat of fine white serge containing a woman
who wasn’t plain. The nightgown effect was
lessened by her toque of blue with grey bird’s
plumage. Another frock was of pale blue with
narrow gold braid. And there was a hat that
looked at a distance like a gilded flower-pot;
closer, you saw it was a shape covered with wide
gold braid. A tree branch, or another woman’s
umbrella, or something mischanceful, had ripped
the braid loose from the top, and the gear took on
a very out-all-night effect. Many of the women
were heavily furred about the necks. What
warmth your neck requires in the day-time if
you’ve an expensive fur, and what freezing you
can endure at night if you’ve a single-stone dia-
mond necklace !
“ The King’s son, and the King’s son’s wife,” as
divers verse-writers in M.L. weeklies prefer to
call the Yorks, have left our coasts and left a big
vacuum in all the cities they’ve visited, but the
Ophir is much deeper in the water thereby. The
))resents the Yorks have garnered in from the cities
c mse the vacuumand thesubmergingof the Ophir’s
Plimsoll mark. W.A. school children, whipped-
up by the obsequious education authorities, sent
silver dingoes, emus, and kangaroos for the Royal
grass-orphans. Amongst the tons of stuff taken
from M.L. were a pair of paroquets and an albino
wood-hen. A carved Maori house furnished,
not with mats and scalps and greenstone
axes, but with addresses from various city
councils, was brought along by a boss chief and
presented on behalf of the councils. How care-
fully the Duke will lose the key of that house !
Of course the Councillors would add the anomaly
of a key to guard their precious, staggering syntax.
Then, there’s the doll which a little girl named
Smith (of South Yarra) sent to the Duchess for
little Princess Victoria. Now, the family of
Smiths to which she belongs will in future be
known from other Smiths as the Smiths that gave
a doll to the King’s granddaughter, and got in
return a letter from the lady-in-waiting thanking
“the little girl Marguerite Smith.” A corres-
pondent writing from Perth tells me that there
was nothing wrong with the arches of welcome to
the Yorks save the inscriptions on them. “Glad
are we that your Highnesses have come,” and
“ Our true intent is all for your delight,” prove
that the text-makers didn’t “tower” in originality.
From M.L. comes the story of a Mayor, who,
after formally welcoming the Yorks in the name
of his Council, rushed the Mayoress and his
daughter up to them instead of waiting for the
Mayoral reception later. At this reception the
Pair were compelled to sit for several hours
listening to the “local talent,” and when they
could sit it no and said they would like to
leave, his Mayorship put the mud roof on his
loyalty by detaining them whilst his daughter
favored them with a vocal selection. Then he
forgot to see Them to their carriage, and They
forgot to give him photographs.
Calling upon a friend at a city hotel recently I
chanced upon a remarkable wedding. The bride,
who is well over 40, wore the conventional white
satin and veil. The little “ Buttons ”of the hotel
was bearing her train, and seemed greatly amused
at the office. Bridegroom is said to be 24 and
poor. Bride is known to be wealthy, with station
property wayback. Some weeks ago she was due
at the altar with a different bridegroom. But
although he. was there she was not, and now the
reason’s plain.
Talking of marriages—one that is to be. Some-
time ago the daughter of one of our Somebodies
went to Europe to study art. After some more
time she returned much against her will, and,
after spending a further time here, insisted upon
being allowed to go back from the Artless, empty
life of this city to her beloved art and fuller life in
the old world. And whilst she was packing her
palettes and tailor-mades, the emptiness of life
here was suddenly filled by a man who more than
compensates for art and the old world. A man
whom she will presently marry. Which reminds
me that Miss Mabel Watson is engaged to Mr.
Stewart Osborne.
Friends are congratulating Knight Harris and
his ex-Mayoress on the birth of their first grand-
child—Mrs. Carty Salmon’s. George Lambert
also hails his first-born in Paris. You recollect he
married one of the artistic and literary group of
Abseil Sisters. Now shall we see the “ Head of a
Child” by G.L. in this or that exhibition. Joy
for the births, grief for the deaths —the death
of Mrs. Stoddart, a sweet little woman, and an
exquisite miniature artist, who died in London
after an operation.
Miss Pearl M‘Crossin’s and Miss Fanny Walker’s
concert last week was remarkable for its good
audience (good in point of numbers, but most un-
reasonable in its demand for encores) and the
quantity of flowers given to the principals. Miss
M‘Crossin has a pretty mezzo-soprano voice. I
liked her best in “ Still as the Night ” and a tiny
song “Violets.” Miss Walker gave Handel’s
“Laseia ch’io Pianga.” Audience made a great
fuss over the contralto, who deserved it, and re-
sponded with “ Caro mio ben.” Herr Veil mar,
Miss M‘Cardell, and Mr. Grimm filled their spots
in the programme satisfactorily.
In future, Mr. Percy Bates’s Saturday-night
Pops will be held at the Queen’s Hall. Poppers
don’t like being disturbed in their pop-pastures,
and the Town Hall has a bad habit of getting
engaged for balls, political meetings, and things.
At the last pop, Miss Winifred Davis was
starred. She is from the Guildhall School of
Music, London, and proved to be a tall, graceful,
very attenuated, dark girl, dressed in yellow,
nervous, and blessed with a nice, above the
average, mezzo-soprano. Another girl was one
with the Duchess-novelette name of Crystal
Rienits. She submitted a soprano voice to the
poppers in “Dear Heart,” and they liked it
well enough to fetch her back for “Two’s
Company.” Yet a third newcomer was
Mr. Charles Rosenthal, from Melbourne Uni-
versity. He’s good enough to leave a large
note dumb at the Melb. Uni., for his baritone is
a really fine one and you could hear all he had
to say in the “Demon King” and “Mighty
Deep.” Mr. W. A. Walsh gave some humorous
reci tations, but he was mocked by an exasperat-
ing echo.
It is really cannibalistic the way that the
majority of our singers and players pounce upon
applause and gobble it up under the delusion that
it’s an encore. Now at the benefit concert to
Father Rouillipj, ,af leaky-boat fame, on Monday
night, the programme was cruelly prolonged
because so many of the performers, after sing-
ing their songs, ran on again directly after
they had run off. Yet the quality and quantity
of the applause didn’t warrant their re-appear-
ance. There’s no mistaking the desire of an
audience to bring the same singer back as distin-
guished from its desire to merely acknowledge the
favor she or he has just conferred. And it’s very
disheartening to the performers appearing far
down on the programme to see the audience
slipping into its wraps and streaking for its trams
when it should be waiting and watching ever,
longing and lingering yet, in its seat until the
Nashnulanthem flung it on to the footpath.
Miss Esther Kahn, who lends tier comely self
to portraiture this week, is a Londoner by birth,
and made her first public appearance as a pianiste
at the age of five. A year later she won a scholar-
ship, which took her to the Guildhall School of
Music, but her studies there were interrupted by
her parents removing to Sydney. Maestro Josef
Kretsehmann then “ discovered ” her, and whilst
under his tuition she made some successful
public appearances. Miss Kahn promises to
be a composer of merit. She has written
several pieces for, piano, organ, and voice. Four
of her pianoforte items were played by her in the
Town Hall, where M. Wiegand also introduced
three of her organ pieces. Paling’s have recently
published a charming song by Miss Kahn, “My
Lady Plucks a Red, Red Rose,” which got a
splendid reception when tenor Henry Weir sang
it the other night.
A tuneful waltz, “The Echo,” comes to me
from Paling’s, also a descriptive song, “ Two
Pictures,” words and music by Edward Finn.
Mr. Robert Richardson supplies the pretty words
to Miss Esther Kahn’s “ My Lady Plucks a Red,
Red Rose.”
Certain insurance managers are wearing black
;n their hearts for the late Mr. “Tin” Kellv.
f J
His death will take some scores of thousands out
of the funds of their societies. He made his
large fortune more as a buyer of metal (principally
tin) than as an owner of mining shares. He had
a great fancy for life-assurance, and only a short
time before his death (and he was over 70) the
M.L. of New York declined to take his life for a
proposed £5OOO. Mr. Kelly leaves a widow, three
sons and a daughter. The last has done a lot of
foreign travel and sings like a bird.
There’s an epidemic of winter sales and
“ wonderful bargains.” All the shops are making
space for their August display. Burnt - out
Hordern’s business, which is located pro. tem. at
Ex. Buildings, would give you some amusement
if you didn’t want the same piece of salvage as
another buyer. The struggle for brands plucked
from the burning shows woman to be a very
panther when her prey (scorched silk at 2d. a
yard) is in dispute. Two ladies seized the same
piece, each asserting a prior claim. Then one bit
the other’s arm to make her drop the spoil. “ How
near to fair is what is good,” writes the poet.
How nigh to God is—woman at a salvage sale.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Her Ex. did the Vic. Artists’ Galleries last
Thursday afternoon. And she had a joke over
the going. The nice concert to accompany the
Countess’ visit was billed for 3 o’clock. So the
Lady thereupon decided to outdo the gapers, and
have her visit over before the mob arrived.
She came a little after 2 o’clock, the bored Capt.
Corbett acting as escort. President Eorde Pat-
terson met the large, cold ladyship and piloted her
around the show. In a heliotrope rig-out, and
large hat of the same bright tone, the Countess
looked even better than usual. She was in a most
active mood and scampered over the artistic
course at a bargain-sale gallop. She pointed an
irreverentdigitatoneaf ter another of the canvases,
accompanying the poke with such disjointed com-
mentary as ‘that’s nice,’ ‘and that,’ ‘O!’
‘Ol’ ‘O ! ’ in a sort of ‘ I see ’ tone,
as her mentor supplied a running fire of
information about the easel workers. She
must have had some prior knowledge of ‘Eern-
shawe,’ the hugest of the pilot’s own hangings,
for she assumed an expression of respect, and
murmured gently (as all praise should be), ‘ Yes,
it’s very fine; I like it.’ The agitated pilot
bowed his crested head. Before Geva Riddell-
Stanley’s portrait, too, the Countess paused for a
second and declared it ‘very nice,’ but in the
presence of the canvas labelled ‘My Mother’ the
frigid lady shivered. It even moved her to a
groan. And yet ‘My Mother ’ is considered by
artists a very clever picture indeed.
“Capt. Corbett, holding his hat in his hand,
far out, as a cook does a saucepan of boiling onions,
followed in Her Ex’s train, not even affecting an
inteiest in the beastly daubs, don’t you know.
When Hugh Patterson, to lighten duty for him,
pointed out some ‘good things’ among the
women’s work (over which he is enthusiastic),
tlie gallant captain let his eyes follow in the
direction indicated, and nodded his head in thanks
or approval—hard to say which. But he broke
into brightness when the Commanding Eye re-
called him to active service, and cleared the way
through a gathering shoal to put her out to sea.
“ It was sad to see the disappointed faces of the
suburban crowd and fashion flutterers who waited
in vain all the afternoon at the gallery for the
arrival of the Countess. They made no pretence
of ignoring the pictures, but sat with their backs
to them, listening to a concert, and watching the
door for the illuminating presence of Lady ’Ope-
toun. There was no one to tell them she had
come and departed, so they waited on and on, and
even when free tea came round and Miss Rose
Mason thrilled them with ‘ Beloved, it is morn,’
and the artists were there themselves in motley
garbs to be discussed, the heart of the watchers
did not rejoice, and the crowd flung itself out of
the gallery doors, with * Thwarted' writ large on
its inquisitive face.
“Even Miss Ruby Madden had enough sense
of humour to bring a camera to the opening of the
Royal Melb. Golf Links, at Sandringham, and
take her dad at the supreme moment of driving a
ball off a specially-prepared ‘tee’! She, radiant
with health and complacency, had the eye of the
camera turned on the Waxellency, with her finger
on the spring. Behind her, a dozen snap-shot
Johnnies had the eyes of their machines on the
figures of both. The Wax. raised the driver,
swung his taut body round, and whew ! missed
the shot. The disrespectful daughter doubled up
and laughed so genuinely that everyone round
about wondered what would happen after such
unusual boisterousness. The Waxellency went for
it again, but missed a second auspicious blow.
“At that opening on the swell Sandringham
links, The Wax. found an excuse for rattling off
some shrapnel jests. He beamed at the opportunity,
threw his chest out, leaned a hip on his gamp, and
wooed the winds and trees and numbed ears of the
passive golfers. ‘ These links,’ he ended with a
perorating smile, ‘ will doubtless be the means of
forming many other interesting links’—and he
shed an illuminating beam on the mixed doubles
that hedged him in. The Chiffon King and Mrs.
Sargood hostedit and let crowds enjoy their over-
flowing buffets. Senators were strewn among the
fashionable throng, and various Reps, of the
House. The Club residence is a palatial place
rearing up among the ti-tree of Sandringham.
‘ ‘ That Clarke-Cotton wedding owed its dainti-
ness, not only to fine feathers, but also to the slim
youthfulness of principals and chorus. It seems
no time since bridegroom Frank Clarke came of
age; his bride, the former Miss Cotton, though
but a young thing, is perhaps the elder of the
pair. Demure little Miss Lesley Madden (who
unconsciously made mows at the officiating par-
son’s queer intonation), shy debutante Vera
Clarke, school-girl Dorothy Cotton, and three
childish relations of the happy couple made up a
group of genuinely-girlish bridesmaids, squired
by unimpressive best-man Russell Clarke and
slim groomsman Cyril Cotton.
“ The bride wore the usual white satin, all lace
and tucked chiffon. The maids, in pink crepe,
varied their skirts with tucks and lace-insertion,
their bodices with big sailor-collars and vests of
white tucked chiffon; their straw hats ran to pink
roses and forget-me-nots, while lace and roses
trailed over their white chiffon muffs. The cere-
mony was performed by that big, handsome
athlete, the bridegroom’s cousin, Rev. Ernie
Hughes, who, by the way, is popularly credited
with forswearing matrimony till he meets ‘ a
woman whose temper is broken by fasting and
her knees calloused with prayer.’
Among the wedding guests, Miss Ruby
Madden affected light furs, pink bodice-spray,
and hat in tones of blue, green, and mauve, as
antidotes to the black gown left over from her
royal-mourning stock. Her sister, Mrs. Vallange,
appeared in pale blue, with pink roses in a Frenchy
hat. Turquoise earrings, violet velvet muffs,
ivory cloth gowns, and Venetian beads were much
m evidence in the dressy throng. S’Rupert’s
dame wore a domestic, tamed-down air. She
came in a strawberry turn-out and many pearl
dependencies, with the Cumming girls—a small
daughter and a substantial young sister being in
tow. The best dressed of all the rustling party was
Mrs. Sep. Miller, who wore a great gown of black
and white (reminiscent of the York visit), a smart
cape to match, and a pale violet hat. Her pearl
necklace (the finest in Melbourne), And strings
upon strings of the big, nobby Venetian chain
(the latest thing in jewels) helped to sheet home
her distinction.
“Another marriage with money in it was put
through very quietly on July 9th, when Miss
Sadie Green, second daughter of the well-known
dancing family, was joined in the bonds to Mr.
Jim Purves, eldest son of the K.C. The bride-
groom, only son of Mr. Purves’s wealthy first wife
{nee Grice) will, it is understood, ultimately suc-
ceed to his late mother’s valuable possessions, in-
cluding the Purves mansion in East Melb., and an
estate at Frankston. It appears that for six years
Papa Purves, who looked high for his boy, staved
off the match, coaxing the would-be bridegroom
on one plea and another to prolong his European
wanderings till some months ago the exile re-
turned, supposedly cured. Now, all of a heap,
came marriage 'by special license at the Registrar’s
Office ; family rage and reconciliation, and depar-
ture of the forgiven honeymooners for Europe, per
the Damascus (July 23rd).
“ Young Mr. Purves plighted his troth to Miss
Sadie six years ago. Despite sea separations and
plots and counter-plots, he stuck, to his, purpose
and never lost sight of his fiancee for longer than
he could help. A month ago, so runs the story,
the couple (whom the Fates were dragging
asunder) met by accident at the races. ‘What’s
going to win ? ’ asked the man, talking inanities, as
men do in time of emotional pressure. ‘ Not Man
of Honor,’ replied the lady with a good play of
wit On a favourite of the race. The meeting shortly
dispersed, but a fortnight later the pair met by
arrangement for lunch. ‘ Before we eat I want you
to marry me! ’ said the constant one. ‘ When, how,
why, what!’ gasped the Charmer. ‘Not a moment
to think ! We’ve waited for six years, we shan’t
wait any longer.’ ‘ But I haven’t time to think it
out, ’ entreated the bride-elect. ‘ Time enough to
think and tell everyone after,’ was the reply. So
a cab was procured, and the ring a little later still,
and Jim and Sadie are going to live happy ever
after. The pair left for England on Thursday.
“ Mornirigton (where the bridegroom’s mother—
Mrs. Grice—lives) rejoiced in a sort of impromptu
way when the pair went down to honeymoon
there, and a highly-decorated railway car was the
final send-off of some merry-making friends in that
summer suburb.
“There is much talk re the misfortunes of a
young lady whom a young gentleman is going to,
or was going to, marry. A young person whom
he is not going to marry heard of the proposed
wedding, and, instead of taking it out of the man,
as commonsense would have it, she put a little
whip under her cape, and went on the warpath
after the intended bride —which is ‘so like a
woman.’ The Watched-for opportunity came, and
the young lady and the young person clashed on
the Block, and fireworks ensued. A very brief
whipping terminated in mutual hysterics, and
now everybody who is anybody wants to know
how the marriage stands—on or off?
“ Boor Mrs. Goe suffered so much (she died of
cancer) that death came as a relief, though her loss
is a sad blow to the frail old Bishop—a childless
Darby bereaved of his Joan. The mourner him-
self seemed the delicate one of the pair, for Mrs.
Goe had always been robust till she developed her
fatal malady. The Bishop and his kindly wife
have never put on frill, looking upon themselves
just as an energetic, supervising couple. Mrs.
Goe was most sympathetic to country-parsons’
wives, inviting their boys for holidays to'“ Bishop’s
Court ’ from town boarding-schools, &c.
“ John Deegan, wine-and-spirit merchant,
who secured the E. Melb. seat in the State
Parliament, has a sardonic smirk, a taste
for fancy vests, an intimacy with Shake-
speare, a turn for playing Shylock, an interest in
the Beef-steak Club, a love of talk, and high
esteem for the first personal pronoun. He is a
good fighter, has notions of progression, and is
extremely satisfied at annexing the seat. His
daughter Lucia warbles very prettily, and was
heard at the Town Hall with John Fuller’s ‘ Pano-
gramorama.’
“Very naive circulars are about suggesting to
bachelors who are neglected (?) in the way of
mending or darning, to put themselves in the
hands of a certain Mending and Repairing Club,
which performs such little services at a trilling re-
muneration,; but present-day Pickwicks are wary,
and Barkises are not as willing as they used to
be. Still, many women are availing themselves
of the benefits of the estimable institution. No
woman minds making a blouse, but nine out of
ten will demur at putting a stitch in a reefed
petticoat.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The successor of Jawbone Neild in N.S. W.
State Parliament is Jawbone George.
State Premiers See and Peacock are still
full of hope. They expect to catch baubles when
they gad to the coronation next year.
Should the High Commissionership go to
B. R. Wise, “ Tom ” Rose, of Argyle, may get the
N.S.W. State Attorney-Generalship.
Barnum-Powell has been presented with
“ a beautiful ‘ make-up ’ box ” by Wilson Barrett
and other mummers. Theatrical and appro-
priate !
President Lackey’s ill-health will, his
friends fear, compel him to resign the chairman-
ship of N.S.W. Leg. Council. F. B. Suttor is
looked upon as his successor.
Dan O’Connor may be a “ Soapsuds Jove,”
but he is still the most picturesque person in
N.S.W. Assembly according to the nightly re-
ferendum of the ladies’ gallery.
Mr. G. H. Cox is the father of N.S.W.
Leg. Council, having been appointed in 1863.
Mr. Henry Clarke is father of the Leg. Assembly,
having been first elected 25 years ago.
Two or three baldheads asked what the
world was coming to when Socialist S. A. Rosa
moved “Jack” Want into the chair at the Hotel
Australia anti-Commonwealth meeting of Thurs-
day week.
Worth noting that Ashton, Edden, J. C.
L. Fitzpatrick, Haynes, Holman, Arthur Griffith
and Neilson, who all consistently opposed the
S’African war, were triumphantly returned to
N.S.W. Assembly.
Three brothers Hogan joined Maoriland
contingents. Two were killed in S’Africa, the
third was wounded in seven places, but got away
with his life, only to succumb to pneumonia on
the return voyage.
Bruce Smith, M.H.R., for a long time
boasted the biggest leg in Australia. But t’other
day he met his match in a Scotch Victorian, who
beat him by a good half-inch. “Must be de-
formed,” whispered B.S. to the ladies.
Let Peacock think of it and writhe—the
policeman who slept on the Duke’s door-mat at
Adelaide got an autographed photo, too ! Pre-
sumably, therefore, Peacock and the policeman
have been put away in the same cell of the royal
brain.
AT MELBOURNE POULTRY SHOW.
Staunch Jingo (reading): Australian
Poultry Handbook, by Edward Rex; price,
one shilling !’ Why, this is another fowl
libel on the King!”
In the high fever of the N.S.W. State
elections Works Minister O’Sullivan put up a
record. One night, between 8 and 9, he addressed
two well-separated metropolitan meetings and
managed to catch the mail-train to his country
constituency.
Mac. Paterson still hangs on to the North
Brisbane State seat, although he has been an
M.H.R. for months. It isn’t money matters that
worry him, anyhow. He is Tyson’s executor, and
the per cent, allowed him means the trifle of
about £BO,OOO.
Apropos the suggestion that the leader
of the Federal Opposition should be paid a salary—-
say £lOOO a year. Printed in the dailies : “ Owing
to professional engagements in Sydney Mr. G. H.
Reid will not be able to attend the House of
Representatives this week.” ’
At Gowra (N.S.W.), the other day, an old-
age pension was granted to John Tom, who per-
sists in a claim —officially disallowed —to have
been the first finder of gold in Australia. Mr.
Tom, at all events, possesses the first nugget
found ,on the Lewis Ponds field.
An Adelaide weekly took the damper for
loyal photographs during the Royal visitation.
Two represented the Duchess under slightly
different conditions, and were labelled respec-
tively—“ Her Highness going in to Lunch’’and
“ Her Highness after Lunch.”
Miss Mary Dunmore Lang, daughter of
the venerated Dr. Lang, the mention of whose
name quickens the blood in every patriotic Aus-
tralian, refused to kiss the Bible as witness in a
police-court case in Sydney last week. She was
allowed to swear in old Covenanter style.
Griffith’s translation to the Federal
Bench means a vacanoy on Queensland Supreme
Court roster that should go to Paul or Noel,
capable minor-court Judges. But as both are sus-
pected of Brains and Democracy S’Onah, in esse,
will most likely be the usual style of thing.
The old lady in the country who, during
the Royal visit to Sydney, presented the Duchess
with a handsomely-worked nightdress, and got a
Testament in return, has since been burnt to death
in her bed. “The men of the village made
strenuous efforts to save the Testament, but with-
out success.”
Sydney E. News refers to “ the much-
quoted philosophy of W. Abdul Sulieman ”
(strong flavor of Solomon !), “the S’African Josh
Billings,” and actually prints, as gems thereof, a
garbled version of one of Charles Lamb’s best-
known quips, and a number of Edward Dyson’s
Bulletin apothegms.
The latest of the pioneers to “go over ” is
Stephen Norman, one of the first employees of the
late Edwd. Henty, at Portland (Vic. ) over 70 years
ago. He had allegedly reached his 107th year.
Though not a rolling stone, having always resided
in the same district since the day of his landing,
he amassed no money.
The Bulletin hears that a lady who was
formerly a prophetess among “ Christian Scien-
tists,” and author of one of their principal books,
is now a confirmed invalid in London. She has a
spinal trouble, which the best Christian Science
healers have been unable to cure, and she has now
condescended to take treatment at Continental
spas and be attended by first-class medicos.
The Commonwealth Senate should stand
well for average height among the Legislatures of
the world. There is not a little man in it. Zeal
and the sturdy Sargood, of Vic.,, are the two
shortest, and they are each over sft. 7in., while
no less than 13 out of 36 members range from

allegation that hot climates beget degen-
eracy that nearly all these big men are
Australian born, and that the majority of
them hail from its hottest parts. The Min-
istry, by the way, has nothing to be
ashamed of in physique, and every one of
its active members is native to the soil.
The nation that starts with cheap meat,
a superabundance of territory and sea air

Australian-born girls would not be a very

came from Tasmania.
“Judas”: Was once in late Mel-
bourne solicitor M‘Kean’s office, when to
him entered a reckless-looking damsel,
with a pronounced black eye. Said she,
when seated: “It was like this, Mister
Mick Kean, me an’ Sis an’ ’im went

Sundee aftinoon—under them red clifts,
y’ know. Well, we ’ad leminade an’

of a voice when he liked, and a small, loving
tremolo whisper when he didn’t like. He didn’t
like just then, and showed the lydy out with the
suave remark that Mr. Purves, Q.C., made a
speciality of such cases, and would probably drag
as much “damagers” out of Sis as the law
allowed.

“ The latest story about the King,” writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “is so
‘ rich ’ that it matters little as to its truth.
Edward VII., desiring to make a present, called
upon the selective taste and services of the
Countess of to buy a diamond necklace not
to exceed £lOOO in cost. The Countess thrilled
and with worldly wisdom saw that the gift must
be for herself. The £lOOO necklaces in Bond-
street were fine, but one at £2OOO pleased her aris-
tocratic eye more, so she personally paid the 100
per cent, difference and submitted the gemmed
circlet for His Majesty’s approval. H.M. ap-
proved so much that he gave it to Madame G., one
of his German connections. Now the C. of

insulting the Royal generosity.”
Died at Sydney, aged 71, that popular
citizen, the kind and cheery Thomas Hussey
Kelly, familiarly known aforetime as “Tin”
Kelly, because of the tin-smelting business in
which he laid a substantial foundation for his
fortune. Mr. Kelly came to N.S.W. from the old
country as a young man and moneyless, and he
long occupied a comparatively humble position in
the establishment of a great Sydney shipping
firm. Then he struck out for himself most success-
fully, acquiring interests in many valuable pro-
perties, including Great Cobar copper-mine, the
last of his shares in which he lately sold for over
£50,000. He no doubt died extremely wealthy,
aud his life is said to have been the most heavily-
assured (£00,000) in Australasia. Unlike many
rich men lie leaves a host of friends among the
poor, to whom he was unostentatiously generous.
The trouble over the Findley business in
Vic. Parliament recalls the row raised by the Fat
class to whom the word “ loyalty ” is synonymous
with all their stolen privileges, when A. T. Clark,
prc rietor of Williamstown Advertiser, was
held guilty of having spoken disrespectfully of
Queen Victoria’s personal appearance. This was
in the days when Berry was a force in Vio.
politics. Clark was in Berry’s Cabinet
and the Fat Stock seized upon his “disloyal
utterance,” and howled it by night and day, with
the object of bouncing Clark out of politics. A
chinless crank travelled all the way from Adelaide
with the object of horsewhipping the Minister in
the street, and did try, but Clark was a powerful
six-footer, and put his hoof down on his assailant
“with a firm hand.” For long Clark was made
the object of numberless petty persecutions, and
never heard the last of “the scurrilous abuse” till
the day of his death, although he personally had
nothing to do with the disrespectful remark in
question.
A Sydney E. News correspondent' remi-
nisces concerning Olive Schreiner %
I little thought, when I first met Olive Schreiner, just
after the publication of her first book, “"The Story of a
South African Farm,” that she would develop into the
woman who seems to set everything at defiance. She was
everything that was lovable to men and women. “ Olive,”
as she was universally called by all her friends, was always
fond of seclusion when thinking out a book, and some-
times went into a convent near London for weeks at a
time ; but, eccentric as she is, she Would not seek the
seclusion offered by a wire-fence prison—even for “ copy.”
When Olive Schreiner went out of public life to devote
herself to ostrich farming, little did she think that Within
a few years fate would have given her a taste of life within
wire fences, too. She was a beautiful girl when about 19,
and wore the daintiest and most original of dresses, which
I believe she designed herself. At the time I speak of
everyone quoted her, everyone sought her ; in fact, she
was the “ lioness ” of the hour.
No one having met her could ever forget her —the
dark, deep eyes, whose sombre depths were most
often seen; but at times, when she was gay, they
flashed and glowed like fire. Her face was dark
almost to brownness, but a rare, lovely color lit it
up at any excitement, and, with her dark mass of hair,
and firm, rounded features, she was most original and
attractive. Her mouth was a feature that certainly gave
promise of much self-will —straight, full-lipped, and deter
mined; but I have seen it exquisitely tender, too.
“ Olive’s” voice was deep, and curiously vibrant, so that
whoever was talking in the room you could hear her
voice quite clearly, although she never spoke loud ; and
things she said seemed to linger in your ears for years.
My memory of “ Olive Schreiner,” as I used to see her at
our house in St. John’s Wood, is one of a sweet,
lovable, artistic, spirited girl, who bore her honors
very meekly, and seemed to have no desire except
to pour her soul into her books. One winter’s
day I walked across London with her, and it seems only
yesterday. The white world all about us, above and
below, the flakes falling fast, the crackling snow under-
foot, and “ Olive,” in her dark, rich furs, walking briskly
and talking of her country and its glory, her eyes spark-
ling as she spoke of riding over the wide veldt in the sun-
rise, the majestic mountains, the splendid men and
women who worked always, and never complained, the
gorgeous scenery and bracing air. I asked if she was
glad her book was such a success, and she replied,
dreamily, “ 1 had to write it.” I shall never forget how
radiant a picture she made that day, with the red sunset
behind the white park trees, her furs white-flecked, and
her face glowing with life and enthusiasm. I know there
was no one in trouble who would not tell “ Oii.ve,” no
child who did not love her, no animal that did not know
ithadfoundafriend.no man or woman who wanted a
helping hand who was refused, no one who was not
better for her company.
She was subject to deep melancholy at times, but
she generally kept to herself at such times, and
many used to think that she was even more attrac-
tive like this, when her face became sombre - and
stern and tragic, more like she is now. People have
FORGOT THAT
SHE WAS DEAD.
BUT CORRECTED
HIMSELF.
“ Gen’lemensh, ash larsh

mush arsh you

spoken of her as an hysterical woman, but I never saw
the least signs of it when I knew her, and I saw her
very often. I have heard from personal friends that
“ Waldo ” and “ Lyndall ” in the “ African Farm ” repre-
sent herself to a great extent; knowing her, I should say
this was so- Many a time have I seen her the heart and
life of a large assembly of some of the most noted people
in literature and art in London, ev’eryOne loving and ad-
miring her, she herself as unconscious as a child of having
done or been anything worthy of notice. She was sedate
and dignified, in spite of her lack of inches and her
plumpness, and no picture I have ever seen has given any
idea of her quaint, picturesque figure and mobile faee.
This is simply a reminiscence of “ Olive Schreiner ” as I
knew her when she first appeared in London, and wrote
her first remarkable book. I remember how astonished
everyone was when she married and settled down to a
quiet life, but it did not Inst long, you see. I knew a
woman with those eyes, and that 'mouth, could not
devote herself for ever to ostriches and a husband. Not
having seen or heard of her personally for years, I can
say nothing of her later life, but as a beauty, a girl of
character, a Charming companion, a marked! v clever girl,
a girl of bewitching gowns, a girl original and versatile’
I idolised her.

Writes Gippsland MERCURY :
Near Foster on Good Friday a sermon was preached in
a large gum tree to a congregation of 25 people, seating

stem had been cut through and a root erected. The tree

Two of these, dusty and crippled, struggled on
feebly, while a third, completely disabled, gripped
a blade of grass with malicious intent. The other
two fought on until one succeeded in sawing his
enemy in halves. He then cursorily inspected
the dead, and wandered away in a lop-sided, un-
certain manner. These ants wore of a dark-green
hue, and about long.

The struggle for a crust is razor-like even
on the ocean-floor. “Jack” Hamilton, M.L.A.
for Cook, N.Q., tells this of Thursday Island
pearling grounds :
“ There are two classes of divers—those with the dress
going down 30 fathoms or more, the air being pumped
into the dress ; and the naked diver who works down to a
limit of six fathoms only. Some times the naked wretch
strikes a patch of shell, and this being bruited around,
along comes the “ dress ” man to annex, whereupon the
naked diver stirs up mud and sand to obscure the locality.
In revenge the men with the pump throw fat meat into
the water to attract the dreaded white shark, and thus
get the original prospector “ scoffed.” But sometimes
the shark tackles the dress-diver, who has to cut the air-
line at his wrist, the rush of water and air scaring the fish,
and sometimes finishing the Jap.

“ C.G.E.” : Have watched the gradual

pale and thin, and I said, “ Susan, Susan,” says I, “ that
child has worms.” Then, in a voice of thunder, pointing
to the congregation, “ You have worms, my brethren !

A Maoriland naturalist has written

is apparently dead, and, if immersed in
water, should the season be summer,
speedily does die; though if dug up in
May or J une, when the autumnal rains
keep the soil moist, and then placed in
water, it, within a few days, casts its
skin and becomes very lively. It is 2, to
3in. long, of silvery sheen and tapering
shape.

poison, at the same time ejected, is caught
by the waiting watch-glass. Now, from

row on the road. Next morning I saw Billy Lifu
searching for something at the scene of the shindy,
and asked what he was seeking. “My finger,”
answered Billy, holding up a hand wrapped in a
blood-stained rag. Billy explained that in the
misunderstanding of the previous night Tommy
Tanna had got his finger in his mouth and bitten
it off. “Perhaps Tommy swallowed it,” I sug-
gested. “ Oh, no,” replied Billy, “ I ask him, and
e say he spit it out.” The finger was found,
whereat Billy appeared much pleased. I inquired
if this unfortunate episode would lead to ill-feeling
between him and Tommy. Billy said that as
Tommy spat the finger out honorably there
would be no break in their friendship, but he
gave me to understand that if Tommy had swal-
lowed the finger the rift in the lute would have
been something considerable.

“ Riverina ” : Be that par. (B. 25/5/T)
about the drunk receiving the gun to shoot him-
self. That sort of thing is fairly common in the
bush. I saw one man struggling with his mates
to get free to drown himself (so lie said). After a
great deal of pulling and shoving, one of the
mates, sick of it all, told the others to let the
would-be suicide “drown his blessed self. 1 ’ The
others let go. The released one stood foolishly
for a while, then, sullenly muttering “Blanky
fine mates to let a bloke drown himself,” he went
to the hut and “turned in.” But the drunk of
your par. was not such a resourceful gentleman as
one I heard of. This beery person, at his own
urgent request, got the loan of a gun to shoot
himself with, went round the back, sneaked to the
only other pub. in the township and pawned the
gun for 53. Then the spree went on.
“Nick”: A queer fish was killed at
Eden (Twofold Bay, N.S.W.) t’other day. It
was about 10ft. long, and much like a shark, but
had no teeth. The whalers pronounced it to be a
“ Bone Shark, ” so-called from having in its gills
layers of a whalebone-like substance. In its in-
terior was found a quantity of “ whale-feed.” Can

“ Xylo ”: Re persistence of vitality. In
Victoria recently a spaniel fell down a shaft 84ft.
deep, and after lying there for 20 days he had
vitality enough left to attract attention by whines.
He was rescued. Also, about the same time, at
Warrnambool, two sheep remained for 18 days on
a narrow ledge of cliff overhanging the sea, un-
able to go up or down; and exposed to very severe
weather. They were also rescued in surprisingly
good condition.

“ A.P.R.” : Queer that some svvaggies
don’t take to peddling. The Asiatics, who
monopolise this trade, are mostly cheerful fellows
eternally .getting “bushed.” When re-directed
they smilingly waddle off along the track which
they were expressly told not to follow. The
colored hawker is an appreciative butt of the
rouseabout’s idiotic jokes, and to avoid mistakes
he grins incessantly, even at one’s most serious
remarks. Still, they prosper, and despite their
capacity for getting lost, they don’t seem to die
on the track nearly so often as mij, bt be expected.

“ Will J.” : Water-carting methods in the
Vic. mallee are curious at any time, but one I
struck recently was something extra. The vessel
used was a barrel, closed at both ends and filled
through the bunghole. A kind of axle projected
at each end ; the thing was mounted on two old
buggy wheels; traces were attached to these
again, and the owner was his own horse. He had
no stock, he said—everything, including his cart,
gone to the dogs. But he seemed delighted with
the success of his apparatus, and asked me what 1
thought of it. “I shall ’ave to be careful of this
drop o’ green stuff, though,” he added; “no
washing or anything o’ that sort. ”

“ Scutum ” : A one-time Glasgow miner
was induced to take up a selection on a branch
of the Wilson River (N.S.W.). The writer,
passing the place some time after,, saw the
selector, armed with a large stick, chasing a horse
up and dow n a little paddock near the road. The
grass in the paddock was what is generally known
as “poverty grass.” “What’s up, mate?” he
asked. “ Horse got the colic or a lazy fit ? ” “I
can’t make out what’s the matter with him, ’’ said
the whilom miner; “he won’t eat this beautiful
grass, and I’m trying to make him hungry.” Said
he had never owned a horse before, and had
always been accustomed to working underground.
The selection is now deserted. >

“ D.H.R.” : lie polo in blackfellow’s grave,
referred to in recent Bulletin. On a station, on
theWarrego, once saw an
aboriginal burial. A hole
was dug in the ground and
covered with logs, leaving
only a small square open-
ing at the top, through
which a pole protruded. In
the grave was the black de-
funct, in a sitting position,
with arms clasped around the
pole. The theory thereabouts
is that the spirit of the departed
can shin up the pole in great
haste should Debbil-debbil come

“ Xerxes ” : Many stories
of animal cunning lately. Should
like to know where the rabbit’s
cunning is. Have noticed
dozens of cases where rab-
bits burrowed in or near

only to be completely
flooded out when the
first rain fell and
plenty of high land
equally favorable for
excavating within a

“ Frey ” : Can
any Bulletin reader
tell me where the
hawksbill turtle (that
supplies the “tor-
toiseshell” of com-
merce) lays its eggs ?
Although fairly numer-
ous on this (Port Darwin)
coast, I have never caught one laying,
though I have seen the green turtle and the
thin-shelled turtle depositing their eggs on the
sandy beaches.
At a N.S.W. coastal station a supersti-
tious Scotchman, with more than a passing
belief in mermaids, had charge. One day
a friend drew his attention to one of these
rare animals in the water some distance out.
Mac. saw it distinctly through his glass, and
ran like a madman down to the boathouse.
With two men he got the boat out, and set
forth to make a capture. As they rounded
a rocky point they came in full sight of
something white topped by a female face
draped with dripping locks of hair. The
floating animal evidently expeoted the boat
to pass; but when it turned right towards
her, while its skipper’s finger was pointed
straig. !• in her direction, she made towards
the rocks at a great pace. The two boatmen
pulled stolidly according to orders, and a
desperate race ensued between them and
the specimen ; but the specimen got there
first, and fled on two dstinctly human legs
along the shore. She was the daughter of an
adjacent land-owner, and the pursuit had
headed her off and forced her to land fully
200 yards from her boots and other pro-
perties. As Mac. hadn’t sense enough
explain that he saw a" large shark not far
off, and had rushed out to save an undressed
fellow-creature, there was a vacancy there-
abouts just as soon as an enraged and influ-
ential father had time to wire particu 1
of the outrage to somebody in authority.

D car Bulletin.— Your correspondent,
“Bright” (8., 18/5/’01) is, I think, barking
up the wrong Lee, or the tree is barking up
the wrong correspondent, when he states that
ring-barking is the “ real cause of the dying
away of boree and myall trees.” I have
noticed many places where these trees died
off, long before ring-barking was in general
vogue as at present. Also in stating that
trees draw rain he is taking the cause for the
effect, as rain most certainly draws up or pro-
duces trees. Witness the dense forests in
countries where there is a considerable rain-
fall, for instance on the West Coast of Tas-
mania, Gippsland, and the Far North of Aus-
tralia. But in the arid interior of our con-
tinent there is hardly any respectable timber
except on the watercourses; and rain, when
it deigns to fall, does not seem to favor the
timbered country any more than the plains.
In my opinion it would be an immense benefit to
N.S.W. to utterly denude it of its useless timber
and scrub, and the sooner the better.

Peter Birr, the English horticulturist,
gives the daffodil a rest in S. Aus., and warns
that baked province that still greater bakedness
will be its portion if, instead of cutting down the
few trees it does possess, it doesn’t go in more
vigorously for planting other trees. Forests in
Australia, he reckons, would recoup their cost in
50 years, as against 70 years in Germany, where
wholesale afforestation is part of the settled policy
of the country.

A GOOD CHANCE.
URCHIN : “Hi, Sisf There's a
charnst of a pair of gloves.
Yer might get er dozen—e’s awful sound!"
Sir John Colomb proposes to move the
headquarters of the British army bodily to
S’Afrioa. Troops that are mostly stationed and
trained about the big cities of Britain, in a crowded
country of streets, roads and houses, are more or
less lost when they are turned out to fight in
empty lands of immense distances, where there
are few roads and no mile-posts, and the lost
soldier can’t refer to a policeman or a directory,
or inquire at a pub. The idea seems somewhat
foolish. The great Scotch county of Sutherland
MISS ESTHER KAHN, a Talented Australian
Pianist and Composer.
has only 10 persons to the mile—less than Viotoria;
and there are other empty wastes in the old
country for the British soldier to get lost in
without going 6,000 miles away from the place
where he may some day be the worst-wanted man
in creation.

What Is A Cold ?
It is now generally conceded that the distress-
ing complaint known as a cold is due to the
presence of a specific micro-organism. These
organisms are always in the air wherever there is
a concourse of human beings. In the purer air,
on mountains, and at sea, they are either absent
or rare. None of Nansen’s people suffered from a
cold during their prolonged- stay in the arctic
regions. There is an island off the coast of
Scotland which is but rarely visited, and its
people never have colds except when a ship is in
port, and then they are highly subject t i iem.
Inhabitants of more thickly-populated areas
probably become more or less immune from attack,
but exposure to cold and damp lowers vitality
and gives the microbes their opportunity.
The first symption of a cold is a feverish
condition. The pores become contracted and the
skin cannot do its work of removing waste pro-
ducts of the body by perspiration. In consequence
the kidneys are compelled to come to the assis-
tance of the skin and do a double, share of work.
This is demonstrated by the visible presence of
earthy salts in the urine just as soon as a cold is
contracted. The burden thus thrown upon the
kidneys is often more than they can sustain. This
is a source of great danger; in fact, nothing is
more dangerous. There is a medicine known as
Warner’s Safe Cure which possesses a remarkably
specific action upon the kidneys, stimulating them
and enabling them to bear the increased strain
thus placed upon them. Personssufferingfromcolds
cannot do better than take a course of Warner’s
Safe Cure, as any break-down of the kidneys or
their incapacity to remove the waste products of
the body will result in rheumatism, gout, indiges-
tion, blood disorders, gravel, debility, or, perhaps,
Bright’s disease. Even when any of these
disorders are contracted, so potent is the action
of Warner’s Safe Cure that it will effect a speedy
and permanent cure.*
THE BEST NATURAL APERIENT WATER.
Hunyadi

Professor Immermann, Basle, Professor of Internal Medicine at the University—
“ Hunyadi Janos has invariably shown itself an effectual and reliable Aperient,
which I recommend to the exclusion of all others. Never gives rise to un-
desirable symptoms even if used continuously for years.”
Average Dose.— A wineglassful before breakfast , either pure or diluted with a
similar quantity of hot or cold water.

E.P.T- : Please don’t quote Parkes as a model
in sucb matters. He might refuse, when hard up, to
accept a public subscription; but he would borrow
money from a man and then appoint him to the Leg.
Council. He did it dozens of times, and it would be easy
to name the men and the amounts, even now. But even
then Parkes may not have been corrupt, for he only
borrowed money from men of the self-righteous, purse-
proud class whom he apparently considered the makings
of good Leg. Councillors. He certainly didn’t appoint
’em because he was grateful for the money lent him, for
he was utterly devoid of gratitude Prospector: Cor-

-Even in the matter of vermin rivalry exists
between Ballarat East and Ballarat West. |
The latter municipality, believing that there ’
is now no danger of bubonic plague, have sus-
pended the payment of bonuses for the des-
traction of rats. Ballarat East magnates are '
urged to follow suit, on the ground that the
ratepayers in that historic quarter will suffer
"another injustice” in having to kill all .
rodents foolish enough to cross the Yarrowee 5
from the city. In short, it is regarded as de-
cidedly "unfair” that Ballarat East should
have to slaughter Ballarat West’ rats free of
1 charge. The wise men in the East and the
autocratio men in the West are at last yearn-
ing for the long-talked-of amalgamation of
these two municipalities, in the hope of wiping
out for ever the pettifogging jealousies that
for many years characterised the dealings of
# the two districts.
A petition was presented (fo the House of
Representatives yesterday by Mr. Piesso
(Tasmania), from, the Women’s Christian
’Temperance Union of Australasia, praying
“on behalf of the mothers of the Common-
wealth, and in the interests of their sons, who
have so freely been given to protect Aus-
tralia.’* that the Federat Defence Bill should
be so amended as prohibit the sale of in-
toxicating drinks at any of the military
canteens throughout Australia.

The Pinnacles, the mine of varied experiences a
few miles out from Broken Hill —it owned a smelter
before B.H. Prop, had one—is now being worked by
the Queensland Smelting Co., and is more prosperous than
ever it was when the last co. (a Sydney venture) had it.
Spite of depressed markets a profit is being made, and
there is 12 months’ supply of newly-found ore in sight.
» * * *
Broken Hill’s exports for the January-June
half-year totalled £1,038,817 ; corresponding half of ’9O, i
£1,103,572. The lead slump was responsible for the
decline. Altogether 197,094 tons were sent over the line
to port; of this 38,834 tons were crude sulphide ore and
136,838 tons concentrates, the latter representing about
850,000 tons of ore. Total output of ore from the field
may therefore be set down at 900,000 tons for the six
months. A couple of by-results of the lead slump are
worth noting. The export of carbonate of lead (the very
best of lead flux, of which only small quantities remain)
has been trebled in the effort to keep the divs, from sink-
ing to zero; while the export of “ zinc concentrates ”
(the poorest of the metal products, of which vast quanti-
ties remain) has absolutely ceased. But in the aggregate
there is still a big margin between cost of production
and value of output at Broken Hill. While the exports
were valued at £1,038,817, the value of the imports (and,
except as to a few sheep and cattle, everything that is
consumed in Broken Hill has to be imported) was only
£593,020. Of these imports, £46,849 worth was mining
machinery—mostly improved concentrating plant.
• • • •
Broken Hill mines have been finding that the
prodigious efforts made within the last two or three
years to do without timber —the reaction from the
'Murkan plan of transplanting a forest of softwood in the
worked-out places—doesn’t pay. And so, from £40,965,
the value of the imports in the first half of ’9O, the figures
have gone to £68,349 in the first half of ’9l.
_*♦ * - »
There is much vague talk just now«f new sul-
phide-treating processes, chiefly intended.to turn the at
present worse than valueless zinc to account. Block 10,
not seeing much fun in maintaining a huge output of its
best ore while lead is so cheap, proposes to use part of its
plant for re-treating the tailings heaviest in metal; but
details of the process are not yet given. More important
probably is the outcome of a long series of experiments
carried out by the experts of the German Metal Go.
Hitherto the co. has treated B.H. ore and tailings only by
a rather wasteful and exceedingly unhealthy dry (mag-
netic) process; now a wet process has been evolved A
French invention is also just above the horizon. But the
best of all talk —results on a commercial scale—has not
yet begun.
» * * »
Tragedy in figures. First half of 11)00, wool
Worth £46,309 passed out of far west N.S.W. thror h
Broken Hill, ditto first half of ’Ol, £15,982. Average
rainfall for the six months to June 30 over the far west
was no more than 2|in. ; and, to make matters worse for
the weak stock, the winter’s cold has been intense,
frequently falling below freezing point. So the figures
for ’O2 wiil probably be worse again.
# * * *
The British has closed its concentrating; mill
and discharged about 450 men —all, in fact, but a few
picked men, who will continue badly-needed development
work. That, as frequently stated here, is the weakness
in this mine’s position. Its neighbor, Block 14, though
but very little of its ore is rich, has a good assortment of
it, including fairly large reserves of easily-smelted car-
bonates; so it will probably hang on, even with lead at
£l2 or a fraction lower. The British would have been
shut down some weeks ago had it not been for the
promptings of the London board ; th.e Adelaide directors
have for some two or three months recognised that the
ore was being picked without hope of profit.
Captain Warren, than whom there are few
better miners in Australia, has been re-appointed general
manager of Block 10, which position he lately resigned
after 13 years’ service. By the way, Mr. Warren is the
only B.H. manager left who is “ captained.” The modern
school-trained man won’t stand it.
* * * *
“ Northerner ” thus savagely curses Chillagoe :
“Re mining in Chillagoe. A man may spend £lO to £2O
coming here, be offered a contract at a price which has
forced some other party of men to give it up through
being unable to make wages, and if the new min refuses,
the chances are that he won’t get another show. If a
contract be unfinished the co. retains 25 per cent, of the
value of the work done, with the right to deduct a fur-
ther 10 per cent, if payment is demanded before monthly
pay-day. The co. can also—according to terms of agree-
ment—cut the price, sack the men, or stop the contract,
without giving reasons. All the shafts are wet and hot
and unventilated. Men are half-time idle ; contracts are
not let for more than 50ft., and a cut in the price is almost
certain on a further contract. Also, you pay 15s. for
501 b. of flour, 11s. for a pair of working boots, and 7s. 6d.
for dungaree trousers (too hot for moles). No vegetables
to be had, and the water-supply (coming from shafts
which are being worked) is highly impregnated with lead
and copper—to say nothing of perspiration. And with
all this joy, the co. offers contracts at which, by hard
bullocking, you may make 10s. per shift. There’s hardly
a man in the place who has been here 12 months, and
miners in search of work should steer clear of Chillagoe,
with its Kanaka-tucker, cruel heat, fevers and agues, star-
vation wages and complicated sliding-scale contracts.”
The liquidators of the London and Globe
Finance Corporation report that they find it impossible
to at present issue a reconstruction scheme, but they
hope that such will ultimately become possible. The
report also states that the liquidators found practically
the whole of the securities pledged to secure the £600,000
advanced, and there were loans still outstanding amount-
ing to £425,000, while the claims of unsecured creditors
exceed a million sterling. No doubt the bulk of this
money was used in rigging Lake Views.
* y« * •
London and Globe: At the collapse Whittaker
Wright said “ he had hoped to retire to be free from these
great responsibilities, but he pledged his health, his
strength, his life and his private fortune to carry this
enterprise to a successful issue.” Now the liquidators of
the concern say that Whittaker Wright has no official
connection with the corporation, consequently has taken
no part in connection with the liquidation.
* * * *
Recent coal-finds near Port Clinton, Broad-
sound, Q., begin to attract attention. If said discoveries
are nearly as valuable as represented and as close to good
navigable water as alleged, the Oallide Syndicators at
Gladstone, Q., will have some nasty sand in their eyes.
Oallide people have about 70 miles of railway to build,
over fairly rough country, a job that is not unlikely to
cost £300,000. After interest, salaries, wages, wear and
tear are provided for, the output will have to be some-
thing extraordinary to pay “ divs.”
* * * *
S. Australia’s latest new goldfield is three or
four miles out from Olary, on Broken Hill line. The
field was first exploitd 16 years ago, was favorably re-
ported on, served as a peg for several syndicates, and
was then abandoned. The present workings are, how-
ever, new ; and as Broken Hill men are taking a good
deal of interest, the place may be explored a bit more
methodically than most S.A. rushes have been. Remark-
ably fine specimens have been found ; but there is
nothing so far in the shape of defined lode or reef. The
gold, coarse and rough, occurs in the cavities of a con-
glomerate, which also contains some very beautiful cry-
stals.
* * • «
Bendigo has a world-wide reputation for good,
plucky and economical mining. Its latest achievement
is this : The Thomas United co. at Fosterville is crushing
divs. out of stone that yields only 26grs. per load. It
breaks, hauls and crushes for a fraction over 3s. 2d. a
load, working ordinary hours and paying the usual un«m
rates of wages. At the beginning of last half-year it had
a credit-balance of £436. Then it crushed 9350 loads for
4700z5., dealt out £6OO in divs. and started the current
term with £39 in hand. Whilst this stone is all coming
from above water-level the co. is prospecting for some-
, thing better below.
* * * *
I Cuprite Tin, Watsonville, Q. : “Face all in
' tin-country, small blobs of good stone, soakage increased,
ground much harder, both good indications. North
drive—no increase of tin face; no more quartzite, a
favorable indication.” It would be equally interesting to
know what would be regarded as an unfavorable indica-
tion.
Wore Them Out Herself.
There was a time when Mrs. Hayes considered
herself to be what she calls “a gone woman.”
She actually divided her clothes and other
personal effects among her children. Thank
goodness—but here is her story, told in her
own way; by all odds the best way.
“ Three years ago,” she says, “I had dreadful
pains across the left side of my stomach and under
the shoulder-blades. My left side swelled up
fearfully. I was laid up weeks at a time, work
being out of the question. While these fits were
on I could neither walk, sit, nor stand with
comfort.
“ 1 was really ashamed to let the neighbours
see me crawling about; so I spent most of my
time lying down or leaning against something to
ease the dreadful pains.
“ I had been a hard-working woman all my life,
but now I lost my strength and dreaded to eat
anything, knowing the woeful suffering I was
sure to experience afterwards; as if eating were
somehow a crime against the laws of nature.
And at night I rolled and tossed about instead of
sleeping.
“The doctor said it was indigestion, and-no
doubt he was right, but he was not able to relieve
me.
“I considered myself a ‘gone woman’ and told
my husband I was sure I could not last much
longer. Indeed, I was so fully persuaded of this,
that I actually divided my clothes and personal
effects among my children.
“ Thank goodness and Mother Seigel’s Syrup
I have since worn out most of them myself.
“After a lot of coaxing and argument (for I
was tired of trying things, and hope had about
died away in my heart) I consented to take
Seigel’s Syrup, although the doctor had advised
me not to touch it.
“ I was not quite sure of the effect of the fir
bottle, but my husband insisted on my going on
with it. So 1 did go on with it, and after I had
got through half the second bottle there was no
doubt of the result. I was much better; I felt it,
and others could See it.
“It was hardly short of a .miracle, the way
Seigel’s Syrup brought me round. From a poor,
weak, and wretched woman, unable to work or
scarcely to raise my hand to do the smallest
piece of work, it gave me back health and strength,
restored me to my husband and family, enabled
jne to go on with my work once more, and, in
short, made me as well aS ever I was in my life.
“ I am now upwards of 60, and ha ve reared a
large family. I have lived in the district about
37 years, and am well known here.
“My husband and sons, as well as our grand-
children, work in connection with the coal mines,
for which the district is noted, I have told all
the neighbours, what. Seigel’s Syrup did for me,
and am perfectly willing that my case should be
published if you think it may be useful. ” ( Mrs.)
Julia Hayes, Mount Keira, Paradise, near
Wollongong, N.S.W. October 14th, 1899.
Mr. John Hickey, blacksmith, at the same
place, Writes that he has known Mrs. Hayes all
his life, and (in common with many others) knows
her statement to be true. He adds that she is
respected by everyone.*

GENUINE PHOSFERINE
Ashton & Parsons, Ld., 17, Farringdon Road, London,
the original and only genuine makers of Phosferine find it
necessary to put the public on their guard against mendacious
imitations of their well-known medicine, that are being offered

It is necessar}? when purchasing Phosferine, to see that it
bears the name of the genuine makers, viz.:
ASHTON & PARSONS, LTD., LONDON.
Phosferine was first prepared by Ashton & Parsons in the
the year 1867 ; its marvellous curative properties were at once

the Grand Duchess Olga of Russia,

the Grand Duchess Serge of Russia,
the Grand Duchess of Hesse,
die Grand Duchess Xenia of Russia.
And the principal Royalty and Aristocracy throughout the World.
Indeed such has been its fame and recommendations, that
there is scarcely a Royal residence in which Phosferine is
not well-known and favourably spoken of.
No other Medicine has been awarded this unique distinction
of Royal favour, and it speaks volumes for its wonderful
restorative properties.
PHOSFERINE

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Is that honorable warfare 1” “ Yes, it
Is.” “ Then what is dishonorable warfare ? ” “It
is just the same.”— Victor Hugo.
It is plainer every day that C. A. Lee is
the stop-gap Leader of N.S.W. Opposition.
Sydney B.T. made him, and is now dexterously
unmaking him.
Newly-elected President Stirling is suc-
ceeded as Tory leader in S.A. Leg. Council by
wealthy squatter Buncan, an even more hardened
Conservative than his predecessor. Buncan has a
record of over 30 years of S. A. political life.
If N.S.AV. Independents, already 31 and
with alluring prospects, only had a leader with
craft and capacity, their strength might dominate
the situation. But the question is—Where is the
leader? The other parties haven’t got him, any-
how.
S.A. is only one constituency for Federal
elections as regards both Houses. It occurs to
the Jenkins Ministry, however, that a bye-election
for a solitary member will be rather costly if it
has to be taken over 903,000 sq miles, so it is
proposed to cut the State into seven electorates.
N.S.W. Premier See’s first exercise of his
power to nominate to N.S.W. Leg. Council was
on behalf of ex-Justice Minister R. G. B. Fitz-
gerald, whom the electors of Robertson have just
kicked out of his Leg. Assembly seat. Mr. Fitz-
gerald’s constituents would not give him a three
years’ seat, and See now gives him a life one.
John Norton was against Reid’s Govt., and
against I -ne’s. He journeyed down to Quean-
beyan on purpose to assist O’Sullivan, in the
recent election, on the hustings. When Parlia-
ment met John walked into the meeting called by
■the “ Independent ” or unattached members, and
no doubt influenced the opinions of that body.
Yet, when the debate on Lee’s censure-motion
was started, he rushed in to declare his “ uncom-
promising hostility ” to all past, present, and
future actions of the See Ministry, of which the
O’Sullivan is the most prominent item.
THE TOAD AND ITS PREY.
TRENWITH : Great Heaven! how the beast grows! Say, Alick, how about our own safety if we feed
him like this? ”
Baby Watt dropped about £l6O through
standing down to improve the chances of Deegan'
against Findley at E. Melbourne. Bay after
'Slection Bard Fitzgibbon started a fund with £1
and invited other Jingoes to roll in their
sovereigns to recoup the loyal infant. They rolled
to such an extent that, after a few City Council-
lors and others had made up a tenner and the Vic.
Cabinet another tenner, the matter was dropped
with a loud thud. Boes the Jingo ever pay for his
aihout ?
“ The Boers have called all boys who have
reached the age of 14 into the fighting line.”
There must be brighter fortune far
For that brave land with trials wrung
Where none too old for heroes are,
And none too young!
In Fiji, the infuriated British autocrat
who runs the show has shut down on Seddon’s
annexation scheme by issuing his large, off-hand
uka.se that anybody who says anything to any
native calculated to make said native dissatisfied
with the present form of Government shall be
gaoled for not more than six months with hard

“ Mr. Arthur Griffith to move : ‘ That no
greater sum than £5OOO per annum ought to be
provided by the people of New South Wales for
the payment of the salary and expenses of the
State.Governor.’” Good! Why should the Aus-
tralian States continue to be the stamping-ground
either of out-at-elbows aristocrats or of British
noblemen who wish to “ try it on the dog?”
Mr. Randal Carey, President of Sydney
8.T., in resigning from the Rocks Resumption
Board, has simply come in out of the wet. The
appointment was made subject to the ratification
of Parliament —which fact, under recently-existing
circumstances, foreshadowed much acrimonious
Parliamentary discussion. No billet, no discus-
sion—so the Major proceeded to get under the
umbrella of private life.
According to London Times, there were
over 24,000 “refugees” in the 12 camps estab-
lished by the British in Orange River Colony at
the end of May. Present cables put the numbers
at 35,000 ; and the death-rate at these camps varies
from 70 per 1000 per annum at Norval’s Point to
383 per 1000 per annum at Bloemfontein—average
of all camps over 116. Kitchener is “pacifying”
the Boers all right. More deadly than lyddite is
the camp-system.
Whafc on earth were the big Freetrade
dailies doing when they failed to suppress last
week’s cable that Britain objected to China in-
creasing her Customs duties to pay the war in-
demnity, because such a policy would virtually
saddle the biggest traders—England and America
—with the whole of the indemnity ? Said dailies
have for years been assuring their readers that the
buyer (China)—not the seller (Britain)—invariably
pays the Customs duties.
Vic. Speaker Mason refused to allow
Labor-member Prendergast, a few nights ago, to
quote from the Leader (Bavid Syme’s weekly) a
satirical estimate of Waxellency "Madden. The
paper said that evidently the way to show the
complete incapacity of a lawyer is to make him a
Judge. Mason would neither have the journal
quoted nor laid on the table. Clearly, things are
coming to a fine pace when lese Maddensty is added
to the list of offences.
Snow’s Tramway Grab Bill has been intro-
duced into S.A. Leg. Council, and is sure to go
through that Tory-bossed Chamber with ease.
It’s sponsor is Vardon, elected last year mainly
by the votes of the workers. Most of the unspeak-
able features of the original measure are still
retained, and the other great question is as to how
many politicians have been retained also. Last
year Price, M,L. A., complained that he had never
seen so much barefaced lobbying during his poli-
tical career.
THE DOG UNDER THE WAGGON.
“ The cable message which appeared in the Argus of yesterday stating that
it was rumored in London that the Salisbury Ministry proposed to give repre-
sentation in the House of Commons to the British colonies was the subject of
much conversation amongst, members of the Federal Parliament yesterday.”
John Bull (to Australian representative): “Of course, we are
profoundly grateful for the energy and patriotism you show
in hauling the Imperial State coach along! ” And yet how
delighted the Fatman type of Australian would he to he
a small portion of the dog!
It is explained by the authorities in Eng-
land that, owing to Victoria having cut down the
salary and allowances of its State Governor to
£5OOO a year, there is great difficulty in finding a
sufficiently gorgeous personage to take up
the job. The Canadian province of Ontario,
more than twice as large as Victoria, and
with nearly twice the population, pays its
Governor £2OOO a year and never has any difficulty
in filling the billet. But Canada merely imports
that gorgeous creature, the Governor-General,
from England. The State Governors are local
men, appointed by the Governor-General. The
misguided Commonwealth wants to import not
only its Gov.-General but its six State Governors
from England, and the travelling expenses of the
glittering object and his family and dependents
must be paid ; also, he needs to be compensated
for loss through leaving his affairs in Britain to a
deputy, and often for the sacrifice of a profitable
connection as a guinea-pig.
Sydney Telegraph opines that
N.S.W.’s financial statement can’t be
presented before November, because
State-Treasurer Waddell must wait till
the Federal tariff is ready, so that he may
know how much extra customs revenue he
is going to have. Otherwise he might
under-estimate the customs revenue and
have a surplus. By way of a really
shocking proposal—how would it be if
State Treasurer Waddell assumed that
the Federal customs tariff wouldn’t yield
any more than the N.S.W. State tariff
does, and provided enough money to pay
his way on that basis, and then, if there
was a surplus, he could pay off some of
the accumulated deficits with it ? It
would be contrary to all Cornstalk tra-
ditions, no doubt, but perhaps the country
could stand it for once.
Friction has arisen already between
some of the old N.S.W. roads-and-bridges
members who succeeded in entering the
Federal Parliament and their successors
in the State electorates. The old mem-
ber, who owed much of his earlier lease
of political life to the assiduity with which
he fetched and carried for his consti-
tuents, still receives applications and de-
mands from his old supporters, and in
many cases he has tried to carry them
out as heretofore. The new comer, who,
in his turn, hopes to establish a mortgage
on his seat by the line of conduct which
his predecessor found so successful,
naturally objects to this poaching. As
the State minister has no object in con-
ciliating the Federal M.H.R. and bends
a willing ear to the request of the local
M.L.A. it is easy to see that the latter
holds the right end of the stick. What
the Federal member fears is that when
he appeals for re election on broad
National lines, the parochial elector will
only remember that he was of no use in
securing a culvert over Dry Dog River,
or a grant of blankets for"the town, and
will vote accordingly.
Poor old One-Man-One- /ote again
bobs up in the Philp program ne for pre-
sent Q. session. It has been on the menu
since ’B7, and the Philp crowd will pro-
bably stump the country on it next year.
Sydney Telegraph has only two attitudes
about the Federal Government. The Govern-
ment gave way on various points re certain early
measures, and the I). T. asked Australia indig-
nantly how long this spineless mockery of a
Ministry was to be endured. Then it didn’t give
way on the Inter-State Customs Bill and one or
two other matters, and the D.T. wanted to know
how long Australia would submit to the Minis-
try’s overbearing dictation and be crushed beneath
the iron heel of despotism.
N.S.W. Labor-party
has a tough question ahead
of it—whether Ferguson
and Sleath, two of its best-
known members hitherto
(the only two who fought
for the Commonwealth Bill),
and another Barrier mem-
ber, Williams, shall be ad-
mitted to the party. All
three ran on the Labor
platform; but all of them,
disagreeing with the local
Labor bosses, were opposed
by “selected” candidates.
On the one hand is the
necessity to preserve dis-
cipline and prevent the
splitting of the Labor vote ;
and that can’t be done by
lightly forgiving anybody
who runs in opposition to
the candidate selected by
the local Labor body. On
the other hand is the doubt
whether the Parliamentary
Laborites should accept
without inquiry the decision
of every little local clique.
In the case of Ferguson and
Sleath they have been
marked men ever since the
last Federal referendum.
The party gave its mem-
bers a free hand then ; these
two interpreted that to
mean that they could figlit
for the Bill if they wanted
to, and they did it. Any-
how, the fact that these
three come from all-Labor
constituencies, and that
their election really amounts
to a popular protest against the tricks and in
trigues of the local Labor-in-politics bosses, ought
to gain for them at least an unprejudiced hearing
from the party.
Sydney Daily Telegraph seizes on the
dispute re passage of Tattersall’s-svveeps corre-
spondence as a means to fan some sort of a flame
against the doings of the Federal Parliament. It
demands to know if such an infringement of little
Tasmania’s State rights is to be permitted. Quite
so. But at the Federal Referendum the Tele-
graph was most sarcastic about the rights of the
same little Tasmania. “ Six Senators indeed ! ”
“ Let Tasmania and Victoria amalgamate and the
same representation do for both.” The paper’s
latter-day solicitude is curious reading.
What a lot of Boers (vide cables) are being
killed, and how very few are merely wounded
now ! Apropos , a private of the W.A. Sixth
Cohentingent, whose full name is given in Cool-
gardie Miner, writing from S’Africa to a Cool-
gardie friend, says :
There are about 30 columns on the march, trying to
catch General Botha, but he manages to give them the
slip somehow, or they are not trying to catch him. The'
Australians said that they won’t take prisoners. They
have made up their minds about that lot. The bayonets:
are the best for them they reckon.
Noble warriors!
How the “Patriotic Bias ” warps minds !'
George Meredith, in his “ lines on the Voyage of-
the Ophir,” in the May Pall-Mall Mag., has.
set his admirers a tougher problem than ever the
Philistines found in the “Egoist.” Banal and
Jingo commonplace ! “ Victoria’s holy name ”is
invoked as by any penny-a-liner, and Kipling at
his worst never plastered England with stickier
praise than this—“ The Power that trusts to
Love,” “Imperial means beneficence and strength
to service bowed.” What of the Boer women and
children who are dying like flies in British
laagers that Boer men may be forced to acquiesce
in the theft of their country ! Surely it is some/
impostor masquerading ? Or dotage ?
A pioneer’s grievance :
Dear Bulmtin.—About Old-Age Pensions: There’s a.
clause in the N.S.W. Act which promises to work harshly
in many cases. No one not British-born can claim a pen-
sion unless he has been naturalised ten years. There are
dozens of aged persons, 50 years and more resident in the
State, who, either from ignorance or apathy, have neg-
lected to take out papers. I know of one man, 89-
years of age, who came out in ’53. He has reared-
an Australian family, some of them now in good posi-
tions ; but he, like many others, is carefully left alone by
his children and grand-children. He is ineligible, for the
single reason that he did not worry about the naturalisa-
tion. Having no other hope but to die in the land of his
adoption, he is classed as a foreigner. Surely his case
would be met by his taking the oath now. On his merits-
few are more entitled to the blessings of the O.A.P. Act
than this old alien.—B.
It is estimated on no worse authority than,
usual that the Westralian transcontinental line
(1100 miles still to construct) would cost £220,000
a year to work ; interest on the inevitable loan for
building purposes at 3i per cent, about £175,000,
making £395,000 ; earnings, £330,000 ; loss, includ-
ing interest, £05,000 a year ; profit, if the line is
built out of revenue, and there is no interest to
pay, £llO,OOO a year. Even if it was only £50,000
a year the transcontinental would be a highly pro-
fitable line —provided it was built out of taxation,
and there was no interest to meet. It would cer-
tainly pay enormously better than jubilee drunks,.
Federal and ducal celebrations, S’African wars,
relief works, dead-houses, museums, and the like.
The calculations are based on the assumption that:
passengers are carried from Sydney to Perth ins
4| days for £l6 ss. first-class, or £lO 6s. second.

The Jenkins Government’s scheme of Parlia-
mentary reform has been coldly received by S.A.
politicians, one daily paper remarking that
many consider the proposals “ill-timed” and
think Jenkins should have “left it alone.”
The proposal to turn 26 politicians out
into the cold world is always “ill-timed.”
When Holder last year proposed a popularly -
elected Convention to re model the Constitution
Parliament said it would deal directly with the
matter “next year” (whichis now), asFederation
would then have been accomplished. Now, it
being invited to act, it has an idea that it would
be better to leave the matter to be settled by the
new Parliament which will be elected in
1902, as it will be fresh from the country
and have a “mandate from the people.”
Of course the 78 members of that body, having
spent money and perspiration in getting in, will
hardly favour abolishing themselves, and will say
that the new election which a re-arrangement of
the constituencies would involve would be a sinful
expense wh&n the country had just been at the
cost of an election already. So the J ENKINS idea
will continue “ill-timed.”
W rites a Man from Kalgoorlie :
Re the recent Westralian railway strike. Facts are:
The men affected have been asking an increase of a
shilling a day (the men on goldfields were getting Bs.
and on coast 7s. per day) for the last 15 months, first from
Forrest, then Throsse’ll, and lastly Leake. Failing to
get a definite answer (the present departmental heads
have .never been known to give anybody a definite answer)
they finally demanded a reply within 36 hours. Then the
excitement commenced. The Government said it recog-
nised Che fairness of the men’s demands and the need for
increased pay, but wanted a board to arbitrate on the
matter. Also, it wanted a month in which to classify the
men—which simply meant shelving the question for
another month. As the men didn’t want classifying,
and the need for increased pay was conceded, they
refused arbitration until the Rev. Geo. Wheatley
(after a week’s strike) joined his prayers to those of
the Government and induced them to accept. Then
a board was formed, the matter considered, and the in-
crease granted, all in a oouple of hours. The Government
nominees on the board evidently had their instructions to
grant everything with as little delay as possible—a pro-
ceeding tending to bring the principle of arbitration into
contempt in Westralia. Apropos, when the establishment
of bonded stores on the goldfields was asked for some
time back, Customs Collector Mason’s chief argument
against the proposal was that a large percentage of goods
were lost — i.e. , stolen—in transit from the codst and it
was necessary to collect the duty at Perth before the
stealing happened, or much revenue would be lost.
Well, the railwaymen’s wages were not (and are not)
nearly sufficient to enable them to live honestly. Eight
shillings a day is scarcely eriofigh to pay the butcher’s
bill in Westralia, if a family is to be properly fed.

Despite the boast of Melb. Age, Peacock
made a wretched speech in favor of the Yic. Con-
vention for the reform of the hide-bound constitu-
tion of that State (writes “Gallery-hand ” to The
Bulletin). Either Peacock’s heart was not in
the task, or he neglected to prepare himself. His
speech was a thing to delight any Opposition
leader —even the dull and dismal Irvine. There
has been strong evidence lately that Peacock is
not the fighter for liberal measures that he once
was. Something seems to have happened to
him. Whether it is the influences of his
Tory father, the Dookoyork’s photo., the Windsor
uniform, or a rapidly-increasing credit-balance
that has made this sudden alteration in the once
fighting Democrat, it is hard to say. Unless he
shows more fight than he did in moving the second
reading, he will never get the Bill through the
Assembly, to say nothing of the Leg. Council.
In his desperate anxiety to get in the
habit of sending away troops as a regular thing,
Premier Seddon of Maoriland aotually appealed
to the British Government for permanent authority
t o seize British vessels as troopships, so that con-
tingents might be despatched in all directions at
the shortest notice. The British Government,
which has had a good deal of experience at
despatching troops, replied coldly tlrat- it found
such violent devices quite unnecessary, and
seemed almost to imply that Seddon was a
bounding ass,
“ Worker ” writes :
Joseph Oook, M.H.R., was in a tight corner during the
recent N.S.W. State election. Ten years ago the workers
of Lithgow, which practically meant the Miners’ Union,
took Joe from the pit’s mouth and put him into Parlia-
ment as a Labor-member. They also paid His election
expenses, because he couldn’t pay them himself. Three
years later, seeing the chance of a portfolio, Oook severed
his connection with the Labor-party, but despite that and
a good deal of other suspicious wobbling, his old work-
mates still stuck to him. At last election, Oook being
out of State politics, his old supporters selected another
miner, Pillans, as their candidate, and expected Cook to
help his return. Sam Smith, M.P., went-to Lithgow to
speak for him, but Oook wouldn’t even take the chair
when asked. There was also a candidate from the
Liberal Association, under the wing of which Joe has
been nestling for the last few years. He wasn’t game to
take sides, so he simply stood by and watched his own
party, who had done so much for him, go down, refusing
to put in one word when they asked him to help them.
The late general secretary of the Lithgow Miners’ Union
has since written to the press thusly :—“ He (Oook) has
branded himself as a spineless ingrate, and, so far as his
sympathy for labor is concerned, has at last shown him-
self in his true colors, and in a light to be condemned by
every worker in the State.”

HYDATIDS
KaJgoorlie, W.A., August 23,1899.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Agent-General for Australasia for Webber’s Vitadatio.
Dear Sir, —With pleasure I write to inform you of the
good I have derived from Webber’s Vitadatio. For many
years I suffered from Hydatids, and a little over three
years ago I underwent two successive operations at a
hospital in Victoria, the doctors taking away five (5)
quarts of hydatids. Shortly after I became ill again with
a pain in my side, and after coming to Westralia the doc-
tors informed me I had another hydatid cyst, and wished
to operate on me. It was then that I saw Vitadatio
advertised, and thought I would give it a trial, which I
did, with the result that I had altogether three bad turns,
getting relieved of the hydatids by vomiting. lam now
thankful to say that the lump has entirely gone from my
side, and that I feel a new man, being better in health
and strength than I have been for many years. I shall
only be too pleased to answer any enquiries made about
my case. Yours faithfully,
tSigned) WM. J. TEMPLETON.

Recently an Adelaide paper published an
alleged libel against John Cosgrove, late of Nance

Critic’s blunder, republished the alleged libel,
of course failing to acknowledge the authority
for the par. Cosgrove has just fired a writ for

Mo. on the course at Rosehill struck a bad time
Saturday, but Mo. in the “shops" did better. Attend-
ww,®Lwm’ garters for six events averaged 17.
™ of Hurdles, an even money favorite, paid
B ? n , fc oub Chippy Norton for the Nursery and
Duke of Kent for the Oarlingford Mile ; both got home
Twlr e u° u !fh to make the opposition look like hacks.
Twenty-two hned u ? ,or Duke ot Kent’s race, but only
two the winner and another—were properly endorsed,
though the public came at 14. Granville Stakes went to
Zone—a stable chum of Cyanide, and recently from Scone,
who romped home, and landed a big harvest of wagers at
Bto 1. Klunbo second, and long-kept Bivalve third
* * * .
Nowadays Mo. shuts up, and warns brother
Ikeys, directly he lays a hundred or two against anything
with a chance. This makes it almost impossible to work
a. big commission unless extra cunning of a unique brand
is brought to bear as that by which Sequence money for
Epsom Handicap was obtained last week. The engineer
allotcea several assistants special positions in Tatts 9
rooms, while others were told off to do the “ shoos ” from
a given point and at signal by telephone. Not a hitch
occurred, and Mo. was carried completely off his feet for
about £5OOO at hundreds to four—something* unusual
these times. 9

Blot ’: Toe-rag Mo.’s at Sydney ooursing
meets are killing the game. Sydney Club’s recent Cup
didn t draw 300 spectators in two days, owing to absolute
impossibility to bet with a fair chance of winning.
Clubs tolerate all (with or without bags) who pay
the required five “bob” which is often all their
capital. The penniless and bagless Moseses won’t take
any risks and always battle to lay the outsier in
each course, asking 6 and 7 to 1 about anything with a
chance, and offering as little as “ evens ” or 6 to 4 against
\ ( , ® ne ' Suggested that only books recognised by
A.J.C., V.R.C., or Kensington, should be countenanced,
When punters would have something more than Buckley’s
show. Like horse-racing, coursing without betting would
speedily shut up.

Victorian legal authorities are not, as is the case
with those of N.S.W., hampered by narrow limits as to the
definition of “what is a place?” insofar as betting is
concerned. T other day bookmaker Gallagher, operating
at Flemington, was fined £25 for betting while wearing
“ tall boots, about Ift. high and sin. broad.” Some
people have fixed on an umbrella as “ a place within the
meaning, &c.,” hence Victorian Mo must bet under the
rays of a scorching sun or in a heavy downpour or leave
business entirely alone for the time being, which breaks
his heart. Truly his brother of N.S.W. is in a paradise
comparatively.

There was a curious happening at the recent
“Tath’s” meeting in Adelaide. The instant each race
starts a gong is sounded, the tote windows being at once
dosed, and no more money accepted. On this occasion
R. King had two horses in the Hurdle Race, The Shirk
being well backed, and Dignity, an ex-Vic. chestnut,
hardly at all. At the last moment a commission was
worked for Dignity, making him first favorite, but,
whether intentionally or otherwise, it was done so late
that the gong sounded in the middle of the operation;
yet someone issued tickets for £230 through a door.
As it happened, the old black Barton just beat Dignity,
paying an unexpectedly good div. out of the clever
people’s money ; but a searching inquiry is promised.
Only fair to the machine to say that such a thing has
never been known to occur before.

Those gentle shepherds who oppose the Tote
might be more profitably engaged in forming a Church-
and-Turf Guild. The Bulletin has heard of a St. Kilda
(Melb.) lady devoting £7 which she won in a Tatt. sweep
to the—er —service of the Lord. Anyway, the lucky
Christian matron straightway paid a year’s rent in ad-
vance for her pew-sitting at All Saints Church. What
more than that can the parsons want ?
• * * *
Rack3traw and Mystery are this scribe’s present
fancies for the Hurdle Race at Caulfield. Both horses
can stay the distance (3J miles), and all going well mean-
while, they will be two of the very fittest starters for the
event in which they are undoubtedly well handicapped.
Rackstraw’s 10.3 is only 101 b. more than he nearly won
the Flemington Grand Nat. with last year ; and Mystery
has exactly the same weight (10.4) that he carried into
second place behind. Valdis in 1899. They are likely to
hold their own against any of the heavier-weighted horses.
But inasmuch as 39 entries for the Caulfield Grand Na-
tional were handicapped at less than IQst., there is; per-
haps another Shoddy in the crowd. The trouble is to
find out which of the lightweights may be expected to
beat such respectable performers as Rackstraw and
Mystery at a difference of a stone or so.

Mr. Martin Loughlin, whose Sir Peter gathered
in first G. N. Hurdles, also owned the favorite (Twilight)
for the first G. N. ’Chase. Seven started and odds of sto
4 were laid against Twilight, Mr. Goyder’s crack Sussex
carrying 13.1 and beating Twilight by three lengths.
“ Tom ” ■ Corrigan piloted two of Martin Loughlin’s
(Wymlet and Game respectively) home in ’B5 and ’B6. The
first time (’B9) of the Hurdles and Steeple being run on
one day saw Mr. S. Miller get the second leg-in of his
Redleap double through Eaglet, favorite and winner from
end to end, with Martin-Bourke in the saddle. In ’9O the
first money was increased by £5OO, making £l5OO ih all,
and reps, from M.L., S.A., Tas., etc., competed. Fearless
11. got home with S. Edge up. Two years later Redleap
(humping 13.3) went out favorite, and scored with a heap
in hand, creating a new record. Eleven of 19 starters
came down. Daimio annexed the ’94 and ’95 events.

Bill of Portland is turning out a gold-mine for
ihis ’Ome owner. His list for this season filled, and, at
latest, close upon enough for next season had also been
received. Over 20 were secured for 1903. Full financial
•significance will be understood when ’tis known that
nominations cost lOOgs. each.
M.L. cross-country rider, A. Ellingham, has
been among the lepping events with a vengeance. All
the principle ’chases throughout the country have at
different times come his way. First, Hawke’s Bay
(500 sovs.), and Napier Park Steeples (’88), as well as
Grand National (a year later) fell to him through Chemist.
He was up on Denbigh when that prad secured the
Wellington ’Chase in ’B6, and steered Moifa over the
jumps and to the front in Wanganui and Auckland big
“leps” this year. Ellingham also won Hawke’s Bay
Steeple with Ruby.

Next M.L. Trotting Conference will consider a
proposal compelling importers of trotters to at once
notify the Trotting Association of their arrival, their
description, and also to forward certificate of identity,
&c. Registration-fee, a guinea ; failure to cofinply with
the rule, disqualification or £2 fine. But this won’t stop
the unscrupulous “ ringer,” who imports Australian per-
formers and runs them as maidens bought out of the
pound, or from untraceable Maoris.

Turner-Billy M‘Kell fight, angled for months
past by several clubs, came off Saturday night at Sydney
Alhambra A.C. Most tipsters picked M'Kell as having
more dash and cunning. After three rounds it was all
Turner, who thumped freely with a telling left and had
M'Kell anyhow at times, though Mac “ scratched” full of
grit and scored well occasionally. After round 10 M'Kell
gave in. Turner now wants to meet Victorian “ feather ”
“Micko” Walsh in Sydney for a good pile. Hitherto,
cognoscenti declined to accept Turner as a first-flighter,
but now there’ll be some money wagered if Walsh connects.

Late Otto Cribb was only 23, and started in his
father’s wake as a tobacconist and barber. Then he tried
chemistry and, ultimately, the bruising business, for
which he had a natural bent. . His first engagement was
at 20; afterwards he had three others with the ‘ ‘ raw un’s ”
in M.L. Oribb’s first and last encounters in Sydney were
with Mick Dunn ; he was tried out by that individual a
day or two after arrival. Cribb would have fought twice
a week had opportunity allowed ; as it was, he scored 15
successes in a little over 12 months. It took all this to
convince some people that Cribb could fight. Absolutely
untaught and cruder than his old-time namesake, he was
one of the greatest natural hands at the game Australia
has owned.
• » * *
All evidence indicates that Otto Cribb
(really A. O. Simpson) was anything but fit for violent
exertion. Post-mortem revealed no very severe contu-
sion. No signs of contusion of the scalp-tissue were
found, the skull was not fractured. Hinder portion of
brain was somewhat lacerated, and from this, bleeding
had occurred. Vessels at the base of the brain evidenced
early degeneration. Both lungs were deeply engorged
with blood (from the lacerated tissue referred to) and
serous fluid. Numerous patches of inflammatory change
of some standing were visible over the surface of the
right lung, which adhered to the chest wall throughout.
Vessels of the heart showed early signs of degenerative
change. Appearances that pointed to the presence of a
certain disease were described. Testifying witness (Dr.
Jamieson) further said hemorrhage on the surface of the
brain brought about by concussion accounted for death.
A blow on the face might have been the cause as follows :
“ The force was transmitted through the semi-solid sub-
stance as through water, and the wave striking against
the opposing surface there created the damage.” Con-
ditions, apparently, predisposed to hemorrhage through
slighter violence than if the system were healthy. The
degeneration of the blood vessels and other aspects indi-
cated the aforementioned disease. No medical man
could have well ascertained these facts during life, and
laymen would have been unable to judge whether
deceased was fit to undergo an ordinary boxing contest
or not.”_ Friends of Simpson aver that after his initial
success in ’Frisco a prominent local doctor warned him
not to fight again for 12 months, otherwise his life would
be jeopardised.

T’other day, at Dublin, Irishman P. O’Connor
set the world’s broad jumpers a fresh task by clearing
24ft. 9in. Previous “ bests ” were American, 24ft. 7£in.,
by Myer Prinstein, at Philadelphia, on April 28,1900;
24ft. 4iin., by A. C. Kraenzlein, at New York, on May 26,
1899; and British, 24ft. OJin., by W. J. M. Newburn, at
Dublin, on July 16, 1898. O'Connor subsequently cleared
sft. 9£in. in the high jump.

Q.-N.S.W. matches over, senior grade Rugby
resumed on Saturday. Glebe walloped Eastern Suburbs
by 10 to 6, after a disappointing .game which evidenced a
had reversal of form. Souths were lucky to beat Norths
by 6 to 3, and, though they top the list, are only 11
points ahead. Newtown and Western Suburbs made
up 12 each ; and ’Varsity absolutely blotted Balmain
out, compiling 42 to 7. South Sydney (17) is now ahead
of all others, with ’Varsity and Glebe (16 each) next, and
Eastern Suburbs (14) filling fourth position. Eastern
Suburbs are in front in the second and Balmain in the
third grades.

S.A. and Victoria meet at football this Saturday
(3rd) on Adelaide Oval. With her best 18 available the
match has always been a sure thing for Vic., but the game
is progressing by leaps and bounds in Adelaide, and any-
thing short of a very strong team from the gold State
will go down. In the first game in Melb., on June 15,
S.A. put up 4 goals 16 behinds to 8 goals 7 behinds, and
would have won had ridiculously easy chances not been
missed.

A. E. Stoddart’s explanation in London Sports-
man regarding the conditions upon which the amateurs
of his two teams visited Australia is refreshing to a
degree." He says : “ Both went as the guests of the Mel-
bourne 0.0. and the trustees of the Sydney ground.
jThere was no question of making terms, but it was under-
stood by me that this meant that the two clubs would
;pay all travelling expenses and hotel bills, exclusive of
wines, cigars, tips, &c. I was, however, left a discretion
in the matter of ordering champagne for the team at the
expense of the promoters when I considered it necessary
—and, wijbh the weather we experienced there, it was a
•necessity. The discretion was exercised by me, freely
but wisely, in the best interests of our health and cricket.
... No payments or allowances of any kind, direct or
indirect, were made to any members of the teams except
jto professionals. . . . Each amateur member had to pay
a considerable sum out of his own pocket, varying, no
doubt, with the means and tastes of the individual but
lin ho case, I believe, less than £100.”

! “ Stumper” : Sydney Mail (13/7/’01) has a pic-
ture of Dundee (New England) C.C., winners of premier-
ship in Northern Border Association last season. Second
man from right, rear rank, is Harry Kiehne, who enjoys
the unique distinction of being the only wooden-legged
cricketer in- Australia—if not in the world. Present
writer has often seen his stubborn defence bring victory
to his side. Of course, while batting he has a man to run
for him. He fields at point, and is safe to stop anything
ivithin reach. Also, he is a “ white” man, and is always
welcome either as a comrade or opponent on the crickef
fields of the Northern border.
Fifth inter-State lacrosse match, N.S.W. v.
Victoria, resulted in latter’s fifth triumph by 16 goals to
3, a repetition of scores in Sydney match three years ago.
Cornstalks shaped a heap better than ever before in
catching, passing and checking. They lacked combina-
tion and knowledge of ways and means of getting goals.
Stiffening of recruits from S.A. players helped N.S.W. a
deal this time. On Saturday N.S.W. went under to S.A.
at Adelaide for 2 goals to 9 —a distinctly good perform-
ance, all things weighed.

Biggest four-bowl event (Association vice-presi-
dents’ pairs) of N.S.W. was decided on City Green
(Sydney), Saturday. Huenerbein and M'Pherson (St.
George B.O.) won—l 7 to 14. Close of first two heads saw
the game 5-love in favor of opposing couple—Law and
Carrie (Petersham 8.C.). Twelfth head totals gave St.
George the lead for the first time—lo-9. Points were level
.(10 all) after the 13th head. St. George scored in each of
the next five and added 7, where they stayed while Peter-
sham went up four, thus finishing three behind. Play
was exceptionally good. Fine drawing shots (the best
feature of the game) were credited to both sides and all
four players in turn. In the semi-final a week before,
Huenerbein and M'Pherson easily beat the crack City
men (Butler and Harris), after showing them the way
throughout. Up to then latter couple had performed
particularly well; two of their heats in successive rounds
were won with a total of 70 to the other pair’s 11.

Roberts-Memmott billiard match at Sydney
(former conceding 2500 in 7000) ended Saturday. Roberts
did as he liked and won by 2095. This wipes out his
recent defeat by 1754 in Melbourne by Memmott. The
Britisher finished latest match with a big flourish of 436
in the afternoon, and 408 in the evening, embracing all
forms of play. He has only done better on this continent
twice ;in Sydney with 500, and Brisbane with 559. Best
breaks of the game were, Roberts : 65, 79, 352, 218, 71,
169, 108, 81, 157, 54, 74, 97, 113, 107, 68, 131, 161, 64, 207,

World’s champion professional swimmer “Joey”
Nuttall, still in the middle twenties, challenges all comers
for £5OO a-side. Nuttall, a marvel a few years ago, has
since run a pub ! His best performance was against
’Murka’s premier M'Cusker, five years back, over the mile
on Hollingworth Lake under 27mins. On this achieve-
ment Sydney champion Read should easily put Nuttall
down. Read covered the mile under 25 mins, last season
and, being only a youngster still, should improve muchly.
That Read, fit and well, can beat Nuttall there is little
doubt; but that Read will be given the opportunity is
quite another thing.

Sad to relate our old friend George Leitch, “ The In-

Does Mrs. Brown-Potter regret the sacrifice of a richly-
gilded billet as James Brown P.’s wife for the anxious
excitement of a mummer’s career? The other week her
daughter, Ann Urquhart Potter, was married in New
York to James Stillman, son of the Standard Oil Co. boss,
and one of the best “ catches” on the ’Miirkan marriage
market. The event at which Mrs. Potter might have
figured as an enviable momma in a peerless Paris gown
and a beautiful state of domestic preservation, only served
to advertise the fact that the worn wanderer is getting
rather old for her stage characters.
There were several dramatic items in the engagement
of the present Italian Opera Co. by Hazon and George
Allen. For instance, when the “ selectors of the team ”
had decided upon youthful Edvidge Vaccari as a most
desirable light soprano, they found that her acceptance
of the Australian offer depended on their being able to
get her bed-ridden mother’s consent to the long parting.
The girl was the sunshine of the home as well as a finan-
cial pillar of the establishment. The gentlemen must go
and see the invalid in her bedroom. Contract was signed
at the end of a second interview, when the tearful
mother solemnly commended the best girl in all Italy to
the care of Signori Hazon and Allen, and sent them
away with a little lump in their respective throats.
Said that Dalia Bassich, who, by the way, is not an
Italian but a Dalmatian, had never played Mimi in “La
Boheme” until she made her brilliant success at Her
Majesty’s, Melh. She was engaged for Williamson’s co.
on the strength of a “Fedora” performance, and will
play the name-part in Giordano’s opera when it is intro-
duced to Australia.
At Kalgoorlie (W.A.) lately, an amateur collection (the
consumptive hero had clay-stained paws 20in.xl8in.)
was playing. a sloppy melodrama to some three-
score accidental patrons, whose approval was expressed
chiefly in ghastly yawns till' the “Juvenile lead” came
along, and was asked in sepulchral tones by a “ god ”
seated in solitary majesty to “ Choose your death 1 ” The
applause that followed that was genuine.
“S.S.” : The most realistic thing seen in Melbourne

An Australian writes to us from the land of the timber
ham : —“ American theatrical taste is largely for variety
shows, here called vaudeville. Continuous vaudeville
goes on daily at half-a-dozen New York houses. Show
starts about midday and runs till 11.30. The programme
repeats once or twice, so that the artists have to show
two or three times daily. Audience can sit all day, and
take its meals with it if it wants to. Vaudeville is the
same old variety, with a larger dash of coon-songs and
cake-walks than Australians are accustomed to. There
is a complete absence of the English comic-song ; the
humor is more satiric —the difference between Judge and
Ally Sloper. Writer tried a one-act piece that had
proved mirthful in Australia and England, but the Amurri-
kan manager said ‘there wasn’t a la-af in it.’ There is
no distinction between vaudeville and the legitimate
here ; a man may star one season and do sketches the
next. Our old friend Daniel Bandmann has been present-
ing ‘ Merchant of Venice ’ as a twenty-minutes’ sketch,
also 1 David Garrick ’ was similarly slaughtered. As a
set-off to vaudeville, the travelling and stock co’s. have
enormous repertoires, and snatch up every success.
Even they do variety business between the acts, for the
American, as a rule, does not go out to see a man about a
dog. The American dog is dead ; I don’t know what
killed him.”
Irene Vanbrugh, the bride elect of Dion Boucicault,
was the original Sophy Fullgarney in “ Gay Lord Quex.”
Jennie Lee, when last heard of, was about to play some
more Jo at a London suburban theatre. The little woman
is as clever as they make them, and her talent might have
been fitted with half-a-dozen star characters in better
plays than the one she has kept alive for the last 30 years.
But no authors came to her rescue. “Jo” is the only
part in which she can get a hearing in her own country.
Jennie is tied to her broom, and doomed to perish always
of a consumptive cough, with the same old limelight on
her matronly form.
“ Trilby ” isn’t played out everywhere even yet. With
young Majeroni as Svengali, Erskine Scott had an abso-
lutely record booking at Broken Hill. And then —at
Broken Hill, of all places in the world! —wet weather
came and marred the season. The Broken Hillite, who
can stand 112° without turning a hair, positively squirms
under a raindrop.
Truly the Queen is dead—very, very dead; long live

Housework.”
Housework seems easy to a man, but there is a
great deal of lifting and reaching to do, a great
many trips up and down stairs to make in the
course of a day’s housework. It’s hard "when a
woman is well—for a woman suffering from some
form of disease it is daily
torment. There are thou-
sands of such women
struggling along, day by
day, in increasing misery.
There are other thousands
who have found a complete
cure of their ailments in the
use of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. Mrs. Jew, pro-
prietress of the Theatre
Royal Hotel, Brisbane,
states clearly what she
means in a few words. She
writes: —“ For some years I
have suffered from a sluggish
liver, accompanied at times
by severe pains in my chest
and shoulders. These pains
not only caused me intense
suffering, but they often
kept me from doing my
household work, and con-
fined me to my bed. No
medicine gave me permanent
relief, and many failures
made me despondent, so
when I tried Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills I had little
hope that they would give
me any great relief; but I
can assure you that one
bottle made me feel a differ-
ent woman. I find they are
a very good pill, acting mildly and searphingly,
benefiting the whole system; I can recommend them
to anybody needing such a medicine.” Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier and a
positive cure for biliousness, indigestion, con-
stipation, headaches, sallow complexion, liver
and kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils,
blotches, and female ailments. Sold by chemists

“At Marshall Hall’s orchestral concert, attended
by an admiring crowd, it was a lesson in hero-
worship to see women raise their hands and sort
of aim applause, not at the orchestra, but at the
conductor, who, for all his seeming indifference,
no doubt inhales such incense with secret satisfac-
tion. The Hymner, thanks to button-hole posy
and neat, though not spick-and-span, attire, looked
less rough-hewn than in Tom Roberts’ portrait,
which suffers from over-accentuation of that black
coster curl, plastered down towards bridge of
sitter’s nose. Artist might have done worse than
accidentally singe off the forelock, at the risk of a
storm, of course, for the ex-Prof. is understood to
pride himself on his low forehead—so Greek, you
know.
“ The concert music was all masterly, especially
that tender, soothing ‘ Siegfried Idyll.’ Wagner
did well to make it ‘ soothing ’ considering that it
was first performed at dawn, outside the bedroom
door of Wagner junior (aged one year) and his
ma. Travaglini, of the Opera Co., aired his dress-
suit by daylight and gave a strong, calm rendering
of an air from ‘ the Magic Flute.’
“The evergreen Napoleon Boffard was turned
on at the third musical at-home of the season (at
Mrs. Albert Miller’s) last Friday to make an
announcement. It was the most amusing that
happened—funny things being out of the way of
these affairs. ‘ I haf to make the apologies of
Signorina Rebottaro, who is ill by the influenza, ’
declared the stout tenor, with many sweet smiles
and nods. The frilly gathering giggled for an
hour over the statement, and Nap. tripped off
the platform with the triumphant air of a pre-
cocious pirouetter. At that gathering, Mrs. H.
M. Cox was singled out for special attention.
The Daylesford heiress that was has developed
into a very quiet, retiring dame. But the taste
for hunting-pink still goes strong. It appeared in
her vest (with a purple costume) and under her
hat-brim.
“First night of ‘Rigoletto’ drew a big, live
crowd. Sapio, as Gilda, the court jester’s daughter,
looked sweet, girlish and innocent, in fair plait
and white gown trimmed with pale-blue. She
would be an ideal Marguerite with those sad eyes
of hers ; her appearance steers between the
usual versions, which serve up Mephisto’s mash
either as a doll-faced simpleton, or a gullible
dowager.
“The Sapio voice was in excellent trim, flexible
as a bird’s, clear as a silver bell. Bozzoli, as the
hump-backed buffoon, was powerful and pathetic.
People in the cloak-room, afterwards, were raving
about Dani, but all my sympathy was enlisted by
Rigoletto (Bozzoli). Dani’s ‘ Donnae mobile’was
to me a shade tinny and disappointing ; pathetic
songs suit him better than frivolous ones.
“At ‘Rigoletto,’ Mrs. Dalzell was the most
attractive frocker. Beside the Scotch charmer,
local women, no matter how crimped, cos-
tumed, and complexioned, dwindled in dis-
tinction. Even Mdlle Duret, with her chiffon
sentinels arresting attention in her hair
and shoulders, missed the ’bus. Mrs. Bob
Power and a host of swagger dames are rigging
up showy powder and flower sets for the District
Nursing Ball, next Wednesday (7th). It was the
intention of the fair engineers to raise a canopy of
flowery stalls and decked crooks for the Gov.-
General and the haughty Generaless to walk under
on entering the hall, but as it is pretty certain the
dual Excellency can’t break through the mourning
hedges, the canopy will not be. Mrs. Power will
secure their presence if anyone can, for the tactful
wife of sporting “Bob” is in strong favor at
Govmentouse.
“ Lady Hopetoun, distributing the Humane
Society’s awards at the Town Hall (July 22nd),
wore seal cloak with sable collar and hat covered
with lilac. She and her chum sat in a row with
Mrs. Barton, Janet Lady Clarke, &c., quite ignor-
ing her feminine neighbours.
“ Not one of the heroes that got the Humane
Society’s medals was handsome, courtly, or even
very big and strong ; and they nearly all blushed
and blundered in the public gaze. First re-
cipient, just a boy, was so nervous he turned his
back on the Countess, but when someone was
drowning he toed the scratch all right. Next one,
an elderly man (Irish, I guess), all _ bows and
salutes, had got badly knocked about in stopping
a bolting van. Number three was a white-
bearded patriarch ; another, a railway-porter, had
jumped into a deep well, all broken bottles at the
bottom, and saved a child. Policemen, a clerk,
a woman, a little girl, all had proved themselves
willing to lay down their lives for strangers. A
thin little chap made the spectators laugh, be-
cause, in his confusion, he ran to hand-shake the>
Countess prematurely. This poor boy had rushed,
into a burning house in search of his little sister,
groped about till he was badly burnt himself, and'
failed in his quest, after all. A blind, lame
miner, led by his wife to get his medal, had
climbed up ladders and crawled along shafts
to get help for his mate, bleeding, blind, dazed,
and maimed though he was.
“ The deed of that blind miner, Madden, was a
splendid one, unsurpassed in its heroism, as any-
one who read the details will admit. What a
pity that instead of the brave man’s poor reward
being handed him by so cool and uninspiring a
personage as the Countess, he could not have re-
ceived it at the hands of some magnetic woman of
high estate whose enthusiasm would be con-
tagious ! Ah, what electricity would have run
through the audience had Madden’s medal been
handed him after a dramatic little speech by such
a woman as the late Madame Lucien Henri!
Then the public might have done something sub-
stantial to help the brave miner. Now, his reward
is to be a miserable 10s. weekly pension. And that
is all!
“ A little Melb. weekly remarks: ‘ Lady Some-
body has a wonderful memory for names and faces,
to which gift may be accounted much of her
popularity.’ The ‘ popularity ’of most people—
in fact, all people whose path in life is paved
with newspaper pars—depends upon their cheap
capacity for remembering names and faces. It
isn’t in the least degree wonderful. The dullest
mortals can cultivate it. A good many politicians
live upon it —this ignoble art of always identifying
the man or woman whom one has noted as a per-
son worth identification. Not to have this
‘wonderful’ gift is, in a person of fair brain-
power, to be broad-minded, studious, and—un-
popular. The higher intellect revolts from the
thought of remembering the names and faces of
thousands of commonplace nonentities.
“The most restless member of the well-assorted
House of Reps, is starch-merchant Robt. Harper.
He passes incessantly from one member to
another, doffs and dons his silk hat a dozen times,
bows and laughs to his relatives in the gallery,
disappears from the debating boards, reappears
again almost immediately, and gives the observer
the impression of being ever before the camera.
He is as restless as a child in a new frock. On
the other hand, Malcolm M'Eacharn is abashed,
never stirs, never speaks, but just watches the
antics of the old political Punchinellos with the
blinking, observant eyes of a tabby basking in the
sun.
“Be tints. The snowy hill-country round Mel-
bourne is worth seeing just now, even at the price
of chilblains. T’other day I explored a mountain
road in a snow-storm. The scene was spared the
sadness lent by leafless branches and skeleton
trunks, though masses of dripping greenery, frost-
powdered foliage, etc., supplied the shiversome
element. Sprays of ripe hips, showy as big, red
plums, blazed here and there against fern-fronds,
glittering with crisp, powdery snow. Baby gum-
trees, tender little saplings, seemed to like the
cold, for their young leaves shone satin and their
tiny stems glowed red as coral.
“ Castlemaine’s Rep.—J. M'Cay—is one of the
most persistent interjectors in the House. This
is the young man who married an Irish girl, had
three R.C. priests to tie the knot (his own dad, a
Presbyterian divine, looking on), and for best man
an Akgus scribe who made such a memorable
speech deriding holy matrimony and all the sacred
paraphernalia thereof. An avowed unbeliever, he
took this opportunity of paying M'Cay out for
making him assist in a ceremony he scoffed at.
But as the speech happened after several fizzing
toasts, the holy fathers put anger out of their
hearts, and forgave him, thinking he knew not
what he did".
“ Marie Lloyd spins along the Block—some-
times in perky rig-out with a saucy nose in the
air, an independent wag of her skirts, a pair
of clicking heels, and the loveliest long chain of
coral pieced together with diamonds. Quite the
most novel and expensive chain one sees round
any swan neck.
“ The push at the Clarke-Cotton wedding at
Melb. St. Peter’s suggested an idea. Janet Lady
Clarke is an indefatigable collector for charities,
But if this wedding had been staged at the Prin-
‘ cess’s, and fancy prioes charged for admission, a
sum might have been raised that would have
saved much wear and tear on the baronial plate.
As it was the average theatre audience, mainly
women, rushed the show, saw it badly, and
nothing was saved but the risk of being fined £2
for overcrowding.
Prom Brisbane
Brisbane was out en massd to see two interesting wed-
dings on 24th. Both took jdace church, and
the sparrows have been since.
Burnley Hill, who led Mrs.
altar, is pretty well known in all the
cousin of Lord Lamington, and in one way or other con-
nected with about half the peerage. The affair is quite
an Indian-summer romance, neither bride nor groom
being in their first youth, but it is said that the latter
was loved as a girl by her present husband. An hour or
so later Miss Mary Tully (whose family is well known in
N.S.W.) was married to Mr. Robert M‘Nab—and a most
interesting bride she made, being a pretty girl with soul-
ful eyes and a very becoming wedding-dress. On the
preceding day the engagement of Mr. Neil Tully was
announced to Miss Queenie Levien, daughter of the
M.P. for Quirindi in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
B. R. Wise, Australian native, democrat,
scholar, orator, athlete, distinguished University
man, is the politician best suited to represent the
Commonwealth in London ; but it begins to look
as if that gilded . commercialist Malcolm
M'Eacharn is biting the ear of Barton pretty
hard.
Queer reading for Australians—
PERISHED IN THE SNOW.
A WATCHMAKER FROZEN TO DEATH.
At Corryong, Vic., a watchmaker, Charles Butler, has
been found frozen to death in the snow.
Poor fellow ! it was the very last kind of death he
could have expected to meet in this country.
N.S.W. State Treasurer Waddell, at New-
castle, on 27th July:
There was one thing in particular he wished to allude
to, and that was that N.S.W. was the only one of the
Australian States whose railway system was paying not
only working expenses but full interest on the cost of
construction. (Applause). All the other States were
behind in this respect.
This is the sort of foolish, ignorant boasting
for which N.S.W. politicians are especially
noted. According to Coghlan’s “ Seven Colonies ”
for 1900, Westralia’s railways have shown a
net profit for six years out of the last ten,
the six profitable years being 1895 to 1900 in-
clusive. South Australia’s lines showed a profit
for three years (1891, 1892 and 1900) out of the
last ten. N.S.W.’s lines showed a profit for one
year only (1899) out of the last ten (though
the Auditor-General disagrees with Coghlan and
declares there was a loss in that year also). The
other three States made a loss every year. During
the last 15 years there was, according to Coghlan,
one (1893) when N.S.W. had the railway system
which showed the largest net returns on the
money invested (of course, the railway with the
largest returns may still show a loss ; it all depends
on the rate at which the money was borrowed);
Victoria had the best-paying system in two years
(1886-1887); South Australia in six years (1888,
1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1894) ; and in the other
six years (1895 to 1900) Westralia was far ahead of
everything. In 1900 N.S.W. only held third
place, and its accumulated railway deficit is close
on £8,000,000. When these facts are available in
the N.S.W. Government’s own publications what
is gained through an inflated parochial character
going round telling the thing that isn’t so, merely
to create a diseased parochial vanity ?
A flourish of trumpets was made over the
landing of a gun captured from the Boers by the
Vic. cohentingent which returned last week. A
special officer was detailed to superintend the
landing, and Govt, went to the expense of hiring
four powerful draught horses to drag the trophy
in triumph through the streets. A special squad
of artillerymen were paid to act as escort, and the
gun was so well advertised that several thousand
more people than usual turned out to inspect it on
the march. But, when the procession came along,
no gun was visible, and the public, which had been
waiting for three hours after the advertised time of
maroh, said “Blanky !” and made remarks deroga-
tory to the Empiah and the cohentingent, a,nd
were even dissatisfied with the official explanation
that the gun was found to be one which could not
be mounted on wheels. The inference was that it
was a gun of position, capable of belching huge
masses of iron at the enemy. Later on, however,
it transpired that it had been removed to the
ordnance stores without any horses or escort. An
artilleryman had simply put it over his shoulder
and walked to the end of the pier, where he took
it on a tramcar to the barracks. This implement
of devastation turns out to be a tiny machine-gun,
weighing a few lbs. It is now asserted by some
rascally pro-Boer that it was captured out of the
pocket of a Cape rebel as he was in the crush
outside the box-office of Capetown Theatre.
New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.,
Ltd., report for week ended July 27th a brisk demand
for merino wools. Result: Fair biz. at late rates. Lon-
don reports merinos hardening, and coarse crossbreds
slightly better. Improved London prices for oats
and wheat have had hardening effect, _ but sup-
plies offering are limited, holders being inclined to
hold. Prices : Chickwheat, 2s. Cfd. ; prime, 2s. Bd.; and
f.a.q., 2s. 7pi. to 2s. Bd. per bushel. There has also been
a good demand for marsupial skins, hair, and horns,
sheepskins, and hides, but shank bones can only be dis-
posed of at reduced rates, and tallow has slumped another
68. per ton.
“H.S.R.”: Bulletin is wrong about
Wellington never having lost a gun. He lost two
in the Pass of Maya, in the Pyrenees (Vide Max-
well’s life of D. of W.) “Smiler” Hales is also
wrong when he states that nothing can stop a
charge of British cavalry. Such a charge was
stopped all right at Poplai Grove by the
Johannesburg police who were Paul Krugers
bodyguard during the combat. Otherwise, Paul
would have been captured and the war would
most probably have fizzled out. Also, those
terrific bayonet-charges we read about never
occurred. Col. Moore, of the Connaught
Rangers, asserts that they were for the most part
figments of the imaginations of the war corres-
pondents, and that on no occasion did the Rangers
get near enough to the Boers to use the bayonet,
although the regiment saw most of the fighting -
some of the companies losing (50 to 70 per cent, at
Colenso and Pieter’s Hill. Shouldn’t wonder if,
after all, when we get the real truth, the cam-
paign will resolve itself into a farm-burning and
stock-stealing raid, with about as much glory as
attached to the elephant’s attack on a nest of field
mice “because they had squealed at him.
When the French submarine boat Narval
got back to port after a 12 hours’ cruise under
water, most of the crew made a bee-line for
hospital. The first six hours went comparatively
well, after which the breathing of artificial or
compressed air became difficult and distasteful,
and a terrible irritation and depression seized
upon the nerve-centres. Headache and vomiting
became general, and it was found that the
generating of electricity under water let loose
salts of lead and sulphur among the crew, that
brought on grave intestinal troubles.
“E.D.”: lie Kipling and his critics: An
idea is like a machine. The man who invents
improvements on the latter is allowed by law to
derive such advantages, moral and material, as he
can from his work. So the man who embellishes
an old idea with the decorative qualities of his
genius may be justified in his use of it not other-
wise. But in this case the man’s idea is the mother
by which the late-comer fathers a little quiver of
new ideas. This after all is the process of the
generation of ideas. The English language as
we use it to-day is composed largely of other
fellows’ ideas; we may use the old building-
material, but only to produce new edifices, and
Kipling sometimes tears up a church to build a
chapel. To steal another man’s spire, or window,
or gargoyle, is in an artist a confession of defeat,
and it is a true art instinct that inspires the
builders with a passion for the label: “ Our own
make.” Your artist, when he is most an artist,
wants no other man fathering his brain-bairns.

A Woman Suffragist writes :
“The goody parsons who have backed up the Mel-
bourne telephone-girls in their ill-advised refusal to take
their share of Sunday work with the men, urge that it’s
disgraceful to ask a woman to work on Sunday. How
about the women checking-clerks of the M. T. and O. Co.,
who spend every third Sunday afternoon at the Bourke-
street office ? Or to come nearer home, what of domestic
servants? Do all of these have their Sundays to them-
selves? Do these reverend gentleman brush their own
boots or help to get breakfast on Sunday ? ”
From Mr. W. J. Spruson
Dear Bulletin.— Please let me say, in reply to your
par (20/7/’01), that I did not use the words there attributed
to me. You happen to have in your quotation a rather
mild version of Gipps’ misrepresentation. Some of it was
much better than the average during the last campaign.
The inventive talent displayed by electioneering agents
in that quarter would bring' certain wealth if exercised in
other channels. Also, Labor did not defeat me. It was
Labor plus other weighty influences, chief of which was
“ Rocks Resumptions.” In regard to the latter I was held
solely to blame ; but although I am responsible for the
scheme, I am not, of course, responsible fot the bungling
and mismanagement of Ministers and officials. —W. J.
Spruson, 20th July, 1901.

Premier Jenkins’s measure for the reform
of the S.A. Constitution is energetic and business-
like. Its leading features are :
The abolition of one Minister.
Assembly to be reduced from 54 to 36 members, repre-
senting single electorates, suffrage as at present.
Council to be reduced from 24 to 16 members, elected
by Household Suffrage", with the whole State as one con-
stituency. Half the Council to go for re-election every
three years.
Premier Jenkins proposes to make S.A. Council a
copy of the Federal Senate, only with a less
liberal suffrage, and the S.A. Counci], which cor-
dially approved of the Federal Constitution, can’t
logically object. All the same, it will object—
iliogically ; and then everything depends on Jen-
kins’s sincerity and his capacity for maintaining
the fig’ll it to the last man and the last ditch. The
two qualities, unhappily, don’t of necessity go
together. William Shiels, for instance, could
draft Bills whose cleverness and goodness of
intention brought tears to your eyes, and then he
fought for them with all the fui'y of not much wet
blotting-paper ; while John Forrest can defend a
hoary abuse with the courage of the last man
holding a fortress single-handed.

This Meeting is called upon to elect a Director in the room of the Honorable H. E. Kater,
M.L.C., who retires by rotation. He is eligible for re-election, and has given the necessary notice.
Owing to the death of Sir Edward Knox on the 7th January last, the Board, in terms of Article
94, appointed his son, Mr. E. W. Knox, to fill the vacancy. He is also eligible for election at this
meeting, and has given notice.
It also rests with the meeting to appoint Auditors for the ensuing year.
During the half-year the branch at Finley, in this State, and that at Glassford Greek in the State
of Queensland, have been closed.
The Dividend, free of Income Tax, is now payable.

The following resolutions were carried unanimously :
“ That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated among
the Proprietors.”

“That E. S. Cape, Esq., and the Honorable F. T. Humphery, M.LC., be appointed Auditors for the ensuing

T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
In moving the adoption of the Report, the Chairman, Mr. George J. Cohen, said
I am glad to be able to say that, as compared with our Balance Sheet of twelve months ago, the statement of our
position now presented to you shows an increase in our total figures of £487,000.
On the debit side there is a shrinkage of £40,000 in Bills in Circulation, but our Notes in Circulation and Deposits
and other Liabilities have respectively increased £71,000 and £422,000.
On the other side our liquid Assets are less by £275,000. Coin and Cash at Bankers are practically the same, a
reduction of about £14,000.
The item Government Securities shows an increase of £96, ;00, the Board having taken advantage of the favour-
able opportunity to add to our hjlding. Our Bills Discounted and Advances generally show the very satisfactory
increase of £725,000.

of electricity, and only a fringe of imagination of the un-
told stores of strength and wealth wrapt up in this
phenomenal power. .
Therefore it requires no argument to convince the
most pronounced of optimists that the field in any one of
the great and honored professions of the day is far too
vast for the thorough comprehension of the most per-
fectly brain-endowed man, or body of naturally-gifted
men. Yet in respect of the most delicate and difficult of
all professions-that of prescribing for the ills and
diseases of mankind—we find doctors, scattered over the
globe, off-handedly and without careful, minute, and
searching examination and diagnosis— without any know-
ledge of the past lives of patients—flippantly dashing off
prescriptions for every class of complaint, as if a cure was
as simple as falling over the proverbial log.
Thanks to the march of civilisation, culture, hnd edu-
cation, people are getting to know that modern medical
men who are worth consulting confine their practice to a
certain class of cases. Realising the utter hopelessness of
mastering and curing everything under the sun, and find-
ing that “ gullibles ” are not so plentiful as they used to
be, the wise and progressive men of medicine devote
themselves to one or other class of cases, and work out
the remedies for them to the best of their skill and
ability. . .
What better and more striking illustration of the suc-
cess of Specialists in Skin Diseases, Heart, Kidney, Inver
Affections, Rheumatics, Sciatica, Nervous Diseases, could
the people of this magnificent continent, Australia, have
than the enormous practice of the famous practitioners of
the Electro-Medical Institute. Their skill, attainments,
position, and renowned reputation stamp them as the un-
doubted masters of the classes of diseases and complaints
which have been the study of their professional lives.
When we speak of electricity we think of Edison. Why ?
Because he dwarfs other men in this branch of science.
In the same way, when we talk of specialists, we at once
associate the. names of the Freeman and Wallace Insti-
tute. So it is in every branch of scientific medicine;
some one or two men stand head and shoulders above
their fellows. .
It is the aim, object, and devotion of certain doctors to
he pre-eminent in some defined class of disease rather
than to tinker with a host of complaints about which
they can have but a hazy notion, and superficial know-
ledge. To use a hackneyed but expressive phrase, they
are “Jacks of all trades and masters of none.” Never
since the time of Ricord, the noted French Specialist,
have any men conducted so gigantic and successful a
practice as that conducted by the Freeman-Wallace
Electro Medical and Surgical Institute.
of hard work than any other medical men ; we do it in
the best interests of sufferers. We don’t keep them
waiting longer than we can help, and we suffer many in-
conveniences for our patients’ sakes.”

At the recent annual South Melbourne
competition, or whatever they call it, there was a
reciting tournament for “ ladies who have not won
a prize.” And the piece chosen for those un-
successful strugglers to recite was “ Maternal
Love.” Hopeless spinsters were asked to come
forward in stale white frocks and deliver their
rival notions of “ Maternal Love.”
Looks as if Q. Chief Justice Griffith is
about to move upwards. Want and Pilcher went
to Brisbane last week with, it is said, a certain
object in view, and now Attorney-General Rut-
ledge is bringing in a bill lowering the salary of
the next Q. Chief Justice by £lOOO per annum.
“A mere precautionary measure,” he explains.
As if one couldn’t see the wheels go round; also
what a smack for either Real or Cooper, who will
want the vacant chair ! The salary was increased
£lOOO a year by Griffith, and then Griffith took
the billet himself, but he is to be the only £3500
Chief Justice in Queensland.
William Arnott, the well-known Sydney
biscuit manufacturer, who died the other day at
Homebush, Sydney, is said to have received of
late years, an income of £lO,OOO a year as his share
of the profits of the biscuit business which he ran
in conjunction with his sons. There are many
stories about the old man. One is that he
attributed all his prosperity to the fact that, after
becoming bankrupt and paying a few shillings in
the £, he never rested until he had discharged his
liabilities to the uttermost penny. Another is
that 10 years ago he was going to sell the (even
then) great biscuit business for £86,000, but was
dissuaded by his wife, who said: “What are you
going to do with the boys if you sell the busi-
ness ? ”
One chief ground of Tweedle-Lee’s motion
of censure on Tweedle-See is the enormous length
of time the latter kept N.S.W. Assembly closed
—231 days. Yet that included the Federal and
Ducal celebration periods, when most politicians
were more or less drunk ; the Federal Election
period, when the Assembly couldn’t have been got
together for love or money, because half or more
of its members were away electioneering and the
other half were helping ; the Federal Parliament
opening, when everybody was away in Melbourne,
and N.S.W. General Election. It is alleged that
Lyne promised to call the old Parliament together
before the dissolution, but if he did (which is none
too certain), when the time came for fulfilling the
promise there was hardly a sober M.L.A. left in
Sydney to call together. The Reid Ministry, of
which Lee was the sagging tail-end, once closed
up the Assembly for 193 days, and there was
no general election and no drunks or cele-
brations included in that time to serve as an
excuse. Parkes, the great Freetrade leader,
closed up the Assembly for 245 consecutive days
in 1881-82—with no earthly reason save that
it suited him to run the country by himself for a
while,

Grenfell was not the only N.S.W. electorate m
which the war question was the dominant issue.
We had a similar battle in Waratah. The three
local Labor members voted against sending troops
to the Transvaal, but when the Jingo tornado was
howling two of them got on a balcony to welcome
the first lot of returned sick swaddies —and climbed
down—said they “ did not know the true facts or
they would not have opposed sending troops,” &c.
Only Griffith stuck to his guns—told the chairman
of an indignation meetingun his constituency that
“ this war was the foulest blot in English his-
tory,” that it was “a Dreyfus case expressed in
international terms,” and that he “ would rather
lose his seat than vote to send Australians to take
a hand in it. ” When the election came along his
opponent (Sharp, late Mayor of Newcastle)
flooded the electorate with choice selections from
Griffith’s red-hot speech in the Assembly, and had
a couple of returned cohentingenters speaking for
him throughout the electorate. Griffith adhered
to his position, read portions of his speech from
Hansard at his meetings, and won by over 300
votes.—E. J.

“Gunner”: The Boer war has produced
much of the silly talk about rifle-shooting. Seems
to be supposed that any ordinary man with a good
rifle can knock over another 500 or 1000 yd. off.
Now, a 6ft. man at 500 yd. from the observer looks
exactly the same size as an image 7 l-sin. high
would look 50 yards off. Also, make a mark fin.
long and |in. wide on the wall at one end of a
room 15ft. long, then go to the other end and try
how often you can hit that mark with a saloon-
rifle. Yet, that mark approximately represents
the apparent size of a man 500 yd. off, while a
man’s size at 1000 yd. would be represented 15yd.
off by a mark of but half the above-given size.
Consequently, the man who oan even see another
1000 yd. off—with all the disturbing influences,
such as haze and surrounding objects, has un-
commonly good sight. Current contingent-yarns
about single men being picked-off at 1000 yd. are
sheer blatherskite.
The Duke has finally gone. As a frost, he
was the biggest show that ever toured Australia.
As a person of intrinsic unimportance he monopo-
lises the pastry. As a destroyer of Australian
reverence for Monarchy lie was an unparalleled
success. Next time the English authorities send
along a commercial-traveller in the King business
they will, unless they aren’t fit to be outside
Colney Hatch or Tarban Creek, show us some-
thing much longer, and with a bingey. Australia
doesn’t necessarily respect blue blood, but it is
always prepared to tolerate Brawn.
Mr. A. E. Leplastrier, Manager of the Central

track, 301 b. per yard rails. Rolling stock consisting of
goods waggons and 2 locomotives. North Mount

rails 201 b. per yard. Rolling stock includes goods wag-
gons, passenger cars, locomotives, &c., &c. In Queens-
land, sugar estates were equipped to the extent of 8
miles. Those in need of tramways should communicate
with Mr. Leplastrier, and as Railway Engineers are
attached to his Company’s staff, reliable technical in-
formation will be forthcoming upon receipt of necessary
data, and if required flying, and permanent Surveys, will

Ever the eternal squabble over the bill 1
The celebration banquet on the day Mr. and Mrs.
Cornwall and York galloped through Ballarat
cost some £7O, and the council wrangled for hours
as to whether it should come out of the mayoral
allowance or out of the rates. Of course, the rate-
payers had to pay in the end. To get over
this and similar illegalities, Minister M'Culloch
already has before Parliament a Bill “to make
such expenditure by councils legal, notwithstand-
ing anything contained in any Act to the con-
trary.” What is the use of making Acts to
prohibit councillors misappropriating other
people’s money if they are to be abrogated every
time the prohibited thing happens ?
The Mining-Warden and P.M. at Wil-
oannia and White Cliffs (far-west N.S.W.) has
during the past three years travelled over bush
tracks on official business between 15,000 and
16,000 miles ! And now the Public Service Board
has sent him to Moree for a change.
For years a pew has been reserved in St.
Paul’s Anglioan Cathedral, Melbourne, for the
use of the Mayor and corporation, but as that
soulless body has never used the accommodation it
is now given over for the service of the Governor-
General. Hopetoun, however, is a potentate of
the Kirk of Scotland, and puts his threepenny in
the plate of that serious denomination ; so again
the pew appears to have fallen on barren ground,
so to speak.
An Engineer in Difficulties!
TRIES, LIKE MANY MORE, HEAPS OF
SO CALLED REMEDIES
Meets with Final Success.
fhe Case of
MR. JAMES BURNS.
(By Our Reporter.)
J\° invalid is so difficult to deal with as
the one who has “never known a day’s
sickness. ” For the most part he resolutely
puts away the suggestion—“ That his time
has come at last, that his smooth working
machinery has broken down, and that active
repair is at once required.” No ! the
chances are the sufferer battles on, getting
daily worse and worse, till final collapse lays
him on his back.
“My husband never would have that
anything was seriously the matter with him,
that he was bilious, or that his liver was not
as sound as it ought to be,” said Mrs. Burns
as our reporter interviewed that lady and
Mr. Burns. “ Not till he was really bad
and desperately ill would he give in, and
admit that something was radically wrong
with him.” Mr. Burns, it may be men-
tioned, is an engineer by profession, living
at 107 Stanley-street, North Melbourne,
and well known in that locality. Some time
ago he was engaged in a very arduous
undertaking, where he was exposed to all
kinds of weather, continually knocked up
by excessive travelling, and left for long
periods with poor and irregular food. In
the pride of good health and an iron con-
stitution, Mr. Burns thought nothing of
these hardships at the time; but later on,
like many more before him, he had good
cause to recollect. “ I fell,”said Mr. Burns,
into a low lethargic condition of body
and mind. I had pains all over me. Ido
uot think there was a part of my frame free
from an ache of some kind, I was bilious
with an excess of bile that seemed to numb
all my faculties. I did not care to work, to
move about, to do anything. Yet when I
braced myself to active exeroise I felt better
—that is, while the work lasted ; but when
the excitement and stimulant of exercise
was over I was done, prostrate and desti-
tute of all hope and energy. I suffered
from a pain below my neck and between
Buy shoulders, that cramped up my body.
At the least axoitement my heart was
deranged, and went thump, thump, thump
against my ribs like the beat of a hammer.
My stomach and digestive organs behaved
very strangely, as though they had gone on
strike and quite given up work. No sooner
had I eaten a meal than I had to run to the
back yard and vomit it all up just as I had
swallowed it; so that my assimilative pro-
cess was absolutely paralysed. At times I
would go giddy in the head, like a child
that turns round and round; I could not
stand on my feet, and felt the sick deadly
sensation of one about to faint. If I had
been resting any time in one position, and
went to get up, I was held fast by a stiff
gripping pain in the small of the back.
Gradually I lost all taste or inclination for
food ; I would go for two or throe days con-
tinuously without eating. This starvation
greatly added to my weakness, and at the
«*me time I rapidly lost flesh, and became
reduced to a shadow of my former self. My
nervous system suffered with the rest of
my body, and I became morbidly sensitive
to the least sound. A loud knock at the
door would make me start and jump as
though a cannon had suddenly been fired
close by. My temper became very irritable,
1 was vexed and upset at the least thing
1 slept well, in fact I was always drowsy
but the sleep appeared to do me no good I
was never rested. Sleeping for one hour
was aa good as eight for all the benefit I
derived, and in the morning I would be
more tired than at night. A terror that
haunted my night’a reat wan nightmare.
Brea when I awoke, or, what would often
happen, my wife woke me, I still for a time
experienced the cruel pains of suffocation
and strangulation. This general upsetting
of my whole system affected my eyes ; there
were times when they were quite dull, my
sight becoming blurred, and it was with
difficulty that 1 oould see to read. When I
stooped down there followed pains across my
loins like the piercing of sharp instruments.
M y palate always had a nasty flavour, my
tongue was parched and dry. I became
wonderfully changed in outward appearance
and was depressing to look at, thin, worn
and emaciated, a skeleton of what I had
been.
“ What remedies did you try, Mr. Burns?”
enquired the pressman.
“Heaps of things, various makes of bitters
and blood purifiers, all warranted to cure
oases like mine and all useless, also a
number of.patent and much lauded cure-alls
with a like result. None did me the slight-
est good, in fact I became day by day
steadily worse. It was about this time,
when I concluded that there was no medi-
cine in the world that would relieve my
sufferings, that a book was left at the door
descriptive of the virtues of Clements Tonic.
“ I wonder,” said my wife, “ if that would
do you any good, let us have one more try.”
She went over to our chemist and asked
about Clements Tonic, and that gentleman
told her she could not go wrong in buying
it, that it was the best remedy he knew of
that his sales of Clements Tonic were large
and increasing, and he had received the very
best reports from his customers who had
purchased it, and that there was not the
shadow of a doubt that Clements Tonic did
all that it claimed to do. After that, you
may be sure I purchased a bottle of Clements
lonic, for I know that chemists are not
naturally inclined to give credit to proprie-
tary medicines without good reason. My
health began to mend from the very first
bottle I took. I gained a good appetite, and
my stomach retained the food. My sleep
refreshed me, the pains all over my body in
my back, head, and heart were all subdued.
1 regained energy and flesh and lost my
sallow appearance, my nerves were strength-
ened, and at night I slept soundly, undis-
turbed by dreams ; and very soon my oure
was complete.” J
“I report this for the papers, Mr. Burns,"
said our representative.
“lam glad to hear it, and I hope it will
be read and do good ; it’s all true, and you
can publish it how you like.”

To be made a bishop is the most sump-
tuous form of Christian burial. ” —Mark Pattison.
Queensland Labor-party includes in its
programme for the coming session State fire and
life insurance, land-tax, and a State liquor-mono-
pol y . All good things, but it is much more likely
to get them from the Federal Parliament than
froin the 1 hilp-bossed Legislature of the Piebald
Land. It can’t be too often reiterated that there
is power enough in the hands of the Federal Par-
liament to crush all the corrupt little State olig-
arches, if only the power is rightly used. The
Federal Parliament can create a graduated inoome-
tax, absentee-tax (whereby it can squelch the
foreign land-grant railway syndicates and land-
jobbing syndicates), graduated land-tax (under
which it can establish a great system of resump-
tion of big estates for closer settlement), Federal
bank, Federal assurance office, Federal drink-
monopoly (its power over the customs and excise
can bring that about) —in fact, there is hardly
anything the Federal machine can’t do, if the right
man is at the handle.
Minister Kingston was careful in his
Customs Bill to give the Federal Government the
power of dealing with ships hovering about the
Australian coast for no ostensible purpose. Britain
has long been considering how to deal with the
Dutch “ coopers ” —boats from Flushing and other
Hollandish ports loaded up with liquors, cigars,
tobaccos, scents, and other articles upon which
Britain collects heavy duties. The “coopers”
cruise about off the mouth of the Humber and
oyer the fishing grounds, and do a roaring trade
with the fishing fleets, and also with the coasters
when the latter are going any distance. As long
as they keep outside the three-mile limit the
British revenue cruisers can do nothing, and as
hundreds of outward-bound ships buy large sup-
plies of dutiable articles from the “ coopers,” the
loss to the revenue is very considerable. Kingston
knew his subject pretty well when he put in that
clause, giving power to deal with the “cooper”
when he turns up in these waters.

Beanie’s Bronchitis Core.
THE FAMOUS RBMIUDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs'” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BKWARE OF COUGHS !
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

“Orange, N.S.W.
“Mr. Hearne. —
“Dear Sir,—l enclose for your own private perusal
portion of a letter received from my mother, Mrs. ,
of London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God-send to a martyr to
colds and bronchial asthma. Ido not wish any names to
be mentioned, but you are at liberty to make use of any
portion of this letter you choose, and you can confidently
refer anybody to me.
“ I heard of your excellent remedy, and sent it to Eng-
land. You can see for yourself what an immense success
it was.—Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above:—
“You will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure really excellent. I was very bad when it
arrived, and I immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
much interested in it. He came yesterday, and carried
off the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a chemist who is in a large way here.”
The names are withheld from publication, but will be
supplied privately when desired.
AGONISING COUGH.
NINE MONTHS' TORTURE.
RELIEVED BY ONE DOSE OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE, AND CURED BY
TWO BOTTLES.
“Dergholm, Victoria.
“ Dear Sir,—l wish to add my testimony to the won-
derful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I suffered for nine
months, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
advice, and tried"other ‘ remedies,’ without avail. I tried
yours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
first dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
may depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
wonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.
“ Yours faithfully,
“JAMES ASTBURY.”

The Journalism of Jessica,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She asked in her innocent girlhood whether things
were starched before or after being ironed, and
also propounded a theory—alleged to have been
discovered in a medical book—that tea was more
wholesome made of water that had not boiled.
When the family noted Jessica’s haziness on all
ordinary domestic questions they concluded that
she must be a genius, and shut her up in a
room to write poems and things, as the drawing-
room badly wanted a new carpet.
Jessica wrote ordinary cheerful poems during
her early teens. Then she invested in a Cat, which
sat on her manuscript, and breathed softly in her
ear, and brought in lots of dishonestly-acquired
fish to eat off her best poem.
When Jessica was eighteen years old the Cat
died, whereupon its mistress wrote poems of such
anguish that the editor who read them said she
must have suffered much, and the man ought to
be horsewhipped.
After the Cat had quitted her life, leaving her
hearth desolate, Jessica filled the vacant spot in
her affections with a Man, and the Man treated
Jessica shamefully. She kissed him once—it was
on a Manly steamboat —and after six months he
left off being grateful. She then wrote such
bitter verses on the perfidy of the sex that
another of the species got excited, and became
exceedingly angry with still another man who
hadn’t spoken to Jessica more than three times
and had had no connection with the Manly inci-
dent whatever.
Then Jessica arose and took unto herself a hus-
band, alleging that it would be convenient for her
to have on the premises something legally entitled
to be written-up. She conveyed the man to a
good home—which she kindly furnished for him
with his own money—gave him good food and
raiment, and then waited for him to do bad things
which she could mention in print.
But the man did not rise to the occasion at all.
He did not go out at night, or drop love-letters, or
kiss the servant-girl, though she had got him quite
a good-looking one. He merely reposed by the
comfortable parlor fire, and was ordinary. Jessica
sat by her pile of manuscript. She had just begun
her novel with an elaborate description of her
husband, and an intimation that he was a charac-
ter whose conduct was going to be disgraceful.
It struck her that married life was a failure.
She was a patient woman, however, and resolved
to give William time to become disgraceful. She
knew that she must not be too hard on him. Her
mother had told her that all men were trying.
And at last her patience was rewarded. It was
early Spring—just three months after her annexa-
tion of William—that she noticed a change for the
better in that good man. He began to go out at
night, not boldly and bravely, but slipping out by
gradual movements from one chair to the other,
till from the seat nearest the door he passed forth
into the world of temptation and iniquity. Some-
times he returned quite early—say in an hour or
so; sometimes he was later than that. But
always when he returned he had the appearance
of a man who had gone far. His hat was on one
side; his face wore a hot and excited look. Once,
as he furtively took a seat by her side, she noticed
a patch of something on his left shoulder, and her
heart died within her—at least she hurriedly made
a note to that effect. It was a patch of white
powder.
Then Jessica arose and went to her room and
wrote. She indited burning words on the unfaith-
fulness of husbands. She described her blonde
hero as he came home with the patch of
powder on his left shoulder. She noted his snake-
like curvetings out of the room to escape obser-
vation. At the end of that chapter the interest
was fearfully worked-up. .
As the days passed, her novel grew m force and
volume. She wept bitter tears with difficulty over
the perfidy of William, and then wrote-up her
tears in the next chapter. Her wifely heart
throbbed with indignation and her journalistic
soul with exultation. She throbbed sympathetic-
ally either way. Also the eyes of the heroine m
her story glistened with sorrow.
One evening she was sitting m her room, pen in
hand. Her heart, as usual, was full of grief and
enterprise. Just the other afternoon she held seen
William beckon the servant-girl on one side and
had caught his whisper, “Don’t let her go there,
whatever you do.” She noticed that he had a
small parcel under his arm, of which he said no-
thing when he re-appeared later in the drawing-
room She wondered that a man could dare to
bring jewellery for his other love into the very
house of his innocent and deceived wife.
She had barely finished that last word when
she heard the voice of the deceiver. She came
out of her room ; his face beamed brightly upon
her. “Dear, will you come a little walk with
She obeyed. She felt that the farce must .be
played out. He took her arm, as she noted with
bitter scorn (to be expressed in the next chapter),
and led her into what was euphemistically
termed the garden. It was a poor stony tract of
earth ; to be fit for planting, the ground (some-
body had said) would have to be “ made.
“ To-day is your birthday, dear, said William.
“Is it?” He could remember her birthday,
yet forget so much else. It was a good point to
make the unfaithful husband remember his wife s
birthday—it showed up his perfidy with force of
““And so,” he went on excitedly, “ I thought I
would make you a present.” He opened a side
gate newly cut out of the high hedge, and Jessica
looked into what had lately been but a bare plot
of ground. Now it was covered with newly-
planted vegetation—flowers on one side, vegetables
on the other. , ~
“I did it in the evenings, when no one could
see me,” said William, beaming anew. As he
spoke a tall lily bent forward and bespattered his
left shoulder with pollen. “Of course, these are
transplanted ; I brought some packets of seeds
home to-day. 1 did it for a surprise for you You
seemed so moped. Well, ” and he beamed for the
third time, “ what do you think of it ?
Jessica was silent. Then she suddenly formu-
lated an epigram on the man who bound up his
wife’s broken heart with cabbages and consoled
her aching soul with a potato - patch She
mentally sketched a story of William under his
new aspect, and then and there, with a true
woman’s generosity, forgave him for his want of
Jessica’s novel was a great success. William’s
reputation was completely lost, and she took him
to the Plue Mountains on the proceeds.

A Canadian Vengeance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ip you want to hear yarns, of the sort that never
get into the papers, the convalescent camp at
Pretoria is the place to hear them.
There are all sorts there—Australians chafing to
get out, and Tommies hoping to stay in; Cana-
dians with their broad-brimmed hats, the crown
dented in on four sides; Yeomanry, commonly
known as “ De Wet’s Own ” ; Guards, Royal Ar-
tillery, Lancers—all sorts, in fact. They have a row
of white stones round the place, and military police
to keep you from passing beyond them. In such
a mixed crowd it is not like being with your own
lot, and you must accordingly sing small. The
“ M.P.’s ” have the best end of the stick, and if
they do not catch you when you try to get out for
an evening in town, they do when you are coming
back, so it is all the same; you are up for “ office ”
when the defaulters’ call goes in the morning. It
makes you tired to do nothing but sit on a garden
chair and watch the fire-flies of a night, while
your corps may be going out on the veldt again
any day. But you hear plenty of yarns.
There was a Canadian one night holding forth
to me on the pusillanimity of the British in
general, and of General Hutton in particular.
“ W’dn’t let us help ourselves to a few chickens,”
he said; “ called us gar-dam lootin’ redskins,
next door to it. Don’t think it made much differ-
ence to the chickens, pard. There ain’t too many
chickens left in this section, and I guess a few
came our way.”
Had he heard of the two Canadians who were
caught re-selling rifles to the Boers, and who
received a sentence of ten years apiece for it ?
He had ! They had gone off from their column
in the promiscuous way peculiar to colonials, and
had issued receipts signed “ Lord Roberts ” for
rifles, which they had sold back to the enemy.
They had at length been caught, and one specific
charge of selling two Mausers for £8 was sheeted
home to them. “Now, wasn’t it a gar-dam sil'y
thing to do, stranger?” was his comment. “if
they had made a stake out of it! But a measly
forty dollars ! ” And he spat his contempt.
What about the hanging of those Boers out
Greylingstad way? “I rather guess I was in
that, stranger,” he said. “It was like this, borne
of our outfit went up to a farm to sample the
chickens. There was a white flag up to the ridge-
pole, and they nacherly guessed it was right; but,
damn me, stranger, if there wasn’t a mob of Boers
in the corral near by, and they let drive and
knocked over a sergeant and another, and the rest
got away. Waal, next day some of the squadron
were out on patrol, and a few slipped off and made
for this farm, and grabbed four Boers. They gave
in and held up a white flag when they saw there
was no getaway, thinkin’, mebbe, that nothing
more than a few months’ free board at St. Helena
would happen to them. But they was mistaken
there. We took ’em right out to one o’ them
arrangements they hang meat on, and strung em
up right away, and pumped ’em full o’ holes with
our shooters. ,
“Your officer,” I inquired casually, was he
there too?” ,
“ Waal, stranger, he was, an’ he wasn t. When
he missed us in the morning, he nacherly guessed
where to find us, and he came there right away,
just in time to see us put the ropes round their
necks. ‘Stop that right here,’ says he, ‘and
bring those men along to camp.’ We’lowed wr
couldn’t do it. Told him to keep his head shut,
’cause there was plenty more rope, and the mea,
fixin’ would bear more’n four men—it would carry
an extra one easy.”
“ And were the four Boers you hung the same
who shot your men ? ’’ .• , ,
“Waal, stranger, I couldn’t rightly say that.
But they was Boers, anyway.”
J.
All through its travels the Yic. Labor
Commission seems to have heard the one tale—
that there is no sufficient apprentice system, or
system of technical education, in Australia ; the
rising generation seldom has a chance to learn its
trade thoroughly, and a half-finished, “slummocky
race of workmen is growing up. The worst thing
said about the Yic. minimum-wagelawisthat it has
crushed out a large number of the inefficient —the
inefficient much more than the aged. The em-
ployer who has to pay a good day’s wage wants a
good day’s work, so the inefficient man must go.
It is rough on him, but it is better for the com-
munity in the end. In a better-ordered com-
munity there should be no large proportion of in-
ferior workmen to be crushed out.
Writes an admirer of the Tory-Liberal in
question: —
H J. Wrixon, who has succeeded Zeal as President of
Vic Lev Council, is an Irishman who was educated at
Trinity College, Dublin. There, and afterwards while
reading for the Bar, he did much journalistic work. His
father was County Court Judge (or Chairman of General
Sessions, as they were then called) for the N.W. district
of Victoria 40 years ago. Wrixon’s connection with the
press accounts for his kindliness to all pressmen—who
approach him with case and confidence.
All the same, it was this same approaohable
Wrixon who drafted a Bill prohibiting the publi-
cation of Sunday newspapers in Victoria, and per-
suaded the Leg. Assembly to pass it. The Council,
of course, needed no persuasion. Sunday news-
papers are necessarily radical and hateful m
Fatman’s sight.
The Bulletin receives this letter from
Narrabri: — .
The timber-cutters and teamsters engaged in building
our national railways are very indignant at what they
consider an infringement of their liberty in depriving
them of their right to buy a “ Tattersall s ticket, if they
chose to do so, and propose to hold an indignation meet-
ing to protest against being interfered with in such an
autocratic and tyrannical manner.
The only possible reply is that the timber-cutters
and teamsters seem to have waited till it is too
late. They didn’t protest against the infringe-
ment of their liberties when “Tattersall s inno-
cent gamble was ejected from N.S.W., and they
can’t complain of the Federal Government doing
what they allowed their own State Govt, to do.
Apparently they didn’t care twopence for
the infringement as long as they could get
the ticket. The outrage on liberty was
iust the same when “Tatt.” was driven out
of Sydney as it will be if he is driven out of
Hobart —only Hobart is his last place of refug© in
the Commonwealth, and if he goes from there the
ticket, which has been getting more and more in-
accessible' for years, may disappear altogether.
Five out of six States refuse to deliver
letters to “Tattersall” in their own territory
—largely ~ because the community was too
tired to protest in time. If the Common-
wealth takes the action of five out of six States
as expressing the will of the majority, it is dim-
cult to see what the timber-cutters can do. Why
get so mad about the rumor that Tattersall may
be shut out of Tasmania, while not worrying m
the least about the fact that he is and long has
been, shut out of N.S.W. ?
A Question
Answered.
If the Pianola ent,.
bles those who
have absolutely no
musical knowledge
to play the piano,
of what interest is
it to those who are
able to play ?
This is often asked, and when asked in our showrooms, generally results in the
purchase of a Pianola ; but more often the question finds expression only in
thought, and offers no opportunity for an answer.
PADEREWSKI HAS A PIANOLA injiis home.
ROSENTHAL HAS ONE.
SAUER HAS ONE.
and only recently has ordered two more for friends in Germany, who are themselves
eminent musical critics. This certainly disposes of the question, although it fails to
give the reasoi- The reason is equally clear.
The Pianola increases the
repertory of even these musi-
cians from twenty-five to fifty
compositions which they can
play in concert form, to prac-
tically everything they may
desire to play. It increases
the repertory of every skilled
musician, and gives a reper-
tory to the novice.
The Pianola does not mar
the piano, as it may be moved
up to or away from the key-
board at will.
The Pianola does not mar
the playing, as artistic taste
receives full opportunity for
expression to which the player
can give his undivided atten-
tion.
The Pianola offers relaxa-
tion from the technical and
enjoyment of the musical.
It is true, since the player
controls the expression, the great musician obtains a more artistic result from the
Pianola than the novice, because he is more critical, but in this very point lies the
secret of the Pianola’s fascination.
The player, whoever he may be, gives his own individuality to his rendition.
This causes the musical taste to develop, and it is not long before the veriest novice
finds his own playing preferable to many of the pianistic efforts in the average concert.
Expression-marks appear on the music as it unrolls, for the guidance of those who
may be unfamiliar with the selection.
In this article there has been little attempt to explain how the Pianola is manipu-
lated, the principal object being to show the desirability of the Pianola for every one
who owns a piano, whether he be skilled in its use or not.
We shall be pleased to mail a complete description of the instrument upon request,
although we urge all who have the opportunity to hear the Pianola for themselves.
Can be bought by instalments if desired. Send for Catalogue C.

Dropping the Cross.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sea is calm and the winds are low,
And so slowly the great ship moves
That a man might think she was loth to go
From the last of the South she loves ;
And thought speeds over the sea and the sand
To our pleasure and toil and fight,
For the latest link with the sunny land
Goes down with the Cross to-night.
She has lighted our mountains, slope and spur,
She has shone on our golden plains,
Our poets have fashioned their best for her
As she guided their horses’ reins ;
She has lightened toil, she has listened to love,
She has sung to us, gain or loss,
And our hearts have borrowed the dark above
Because we are dropping the Cross.
The moon rides low on the rail,
And the stars of the North blink cold and white,
But they speak no word of the dear South Trail,
And the Love, the Home-Love will not fail—
Hats off to the Cross to-night!
In the long night-watches, drear and lone,
When the footsore cattle lay,
We have seen her beam in the sky and known
Of a friend till the breaking day.
In the wild night-rides when the winds in haste
Set the great gum-boughs a-toss,
By beam and yard she has held us straight
And the bushmen trust the Cross.
She knows the track to a Barwon home
And the ford by a red-gum tree ;
She knows the gleam of a snow-white foam
Where the Three Kings bluff the sea.
With the gray moonbeams on a Coorong reach
She has roosted the wild-fowl down,
And she knows of love on the Manly Beach
And the last boat back to town.
And the moon rides low on the rail,
And the stars of the North blink kind and white,
But they speak no word of the dear South Trail,
And the love, the Home Love, will not fail—
Hats off to the Cross to-night !
We have taken her lead on the coastal run,
We have followed her over the Bight,
We have knotted the sea-miles, one by one,
At the feet of her, night by night ;
From the falling dark we have picked her shape,
We have dropped her out with the day,
We have worn her chains from the Otway Cape
To an anchor in Table Bay.
Some day, perhaps, if the gods are good
We shall break from the Channel rain,
And take the road that a rover should
And lift the Cross again ;
And lift the Cross with her golden spars
Flung wide to the open blue,
And drop the old world’s guiding-stars
For the guiding-stars of the New !
U.K.

“Tu Quoque!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jack took in the situation at a glance. If his lips
hadn’t gone dry suddenly he would have whistled.
As it was, he said “ damn,” but under his breath,
for Patience was just the kind of girl before whom
no man would care to experiment in language.
She sat quite still with the letter spread out on
her knee. The writing was so large and black and
straggling that there were only a few words on
the page beside the signature, “ Mona Monroe,”
but those words were instinct with all the fire of
unrestrained passion, and to anyone with ordinary
understanding told the whole story. Patience had
more than her fair share of brains ; further, one
could never quite tell how she would act under
given circumstances. There was a mystery or
reserve —call it what you will—in her nature
which was not the least of her charms, but it all
helped to intensify her fiance’s discomfort just
now.
Hers was a face with little claim to beauty if
you picked it to pieces, feature by feature, but
she was more than pretty all the same, and with
a terrible tightening of the heart-strings the man
realised all that he stood to lose by this stupid
mistake. He had given her the wrong letter—
that was all, and instead of the note containing
phrases of conventional congratulation from Mrs.
Monroe on his engagement, Patience had read
that lady’s last letter of passionate farewell—a
letter he had been mad and vain enough to save
from the bonfire necessary before the girl’s arrival
in Bordertown.
That was not the worst of it, either.. Of course
one or two busybodies had found it their painful
duty to acquaint her with the facts of Jack’s
desperate flirtation with that “awful Mrs.
Monroe ” before she had been twelve hours under
the roof of the hospitable P.M.’s wife. But Jack
was clever enough to have guarded against this
by telling Patience beforehand the whole
story of their harmless friendship, from his
own point of view, with a laughing denial
of the rest, and the informers shared the
usual fate of those who came ’twixt the bark and
the tree. _ At the same time he intimated that
the lady in question was not one whom he would
care for as a close friend of his future wife’s ; and,
apart from his fear of confidences and revelations,
he was sincere in what he said. Mona Monroe,
with her unscrupulous conscience and lawless
desires, was no fit mate for this sweet girl, who
had been kept unspotted from the world for his
sake. Whether or no the same character might
have been applied to himself, and the same deduc-
tions made therefrom—he never stopped to think.
He was a man, and therefore incapable of seeing
that the cases were parallel, and he felt
very virtuous as he bade the girl “avoid” the
woman as best she could within the bounds of
chill politeness.
And yet, after all this, she must see the accusing
letter which proved him a liar—and the house of
cards, built of the happiness so nearly within his
grasp, tottered as she spoke !
“ So—it is all true, Jack ? ” she said.
Being no fool, he spoke the truth, which Hone
would serve with a girl keen-witted as she \ *as,
and answered, “Yes, it’s all true.”
She did not speak, and so after a pause he con-
tinued : “ But you’ve a right to hear me, Patience,
before you judge. You have seen enough of this
place to know what a desolate one it is. The only
nouse that was open to strangers was the Mon-
roes’—there was absolutely nothing to do in this
God-forsaken wilderness. She played and sang
and made things passable, and then—though this
you may not take as an excuse—she is very attrac-
+L Ve s^e 1086 to set her fancy on me to pass
the time. She doesn’t really care two straws
about me, so there was no dishonour on my part
to her Women of her type are really incapable
of real love. She is very beautiful and .”
Yes I think I understand,” she said, inter-
rupting, but what of the dishonour to me.
Jack—we were engaged—all the time.”
Jack had expected reproaches, tears, anger—
anything in fact, but this calm, anxious question-
ing, but if she were open to argument so much the
better for him, and he threw his whole mind into
the case for the defendant,” battling to keep
what was dearer than life to him.
He spoke of the difference between real love and
that which Mona Monroe had desecrated by the
name; he spoke of the fear of losing his dear one’s
regard, which had prompted the lie. But most of
. ,®. Jwelt upon the fact (for Patience being a
girl with brains, the truth told best with her) of
the strength of the temptation.
~ Jhere was every excuse for a person,” he said,
who was put to so great a trial as I was —every
circumstance combined to throw us together. She
fascinated me for the time being. I own it,
Patience—but my love for you—the real love, my
little girl was undisturbed. You are just, and
so few women are. Think over all I have said—
and forgive me.”
Then you think,” said Patience, letting a
small white hand rest gently on the dark head
bent before her, “that the one has no right to
blame the other. If two people really love each
other, and one is put into unusual temptation,
ai \< $ lv ® s wa y it, the other should forgive-——
“Can’t you see it yourself, sweetheart, the un-
forgiven one would be ruined—the lives of both,
probably,” he pleaded.
Patience turned her head to look out of the
window. Her small face softened, and her dark
eyes deepened with the shadow of retrospection.
Yes, I see it—l really do,” she said. “ I have
thought it so often myself. I felt just as you
Jkl—afraid to tell you lest I should lose you—and
yet, I would do just the same over again, under
the same circumstances, I think. ... He
wasn t handsome—only nice-looking—but his eyes
compelled me to look. They were full of light,
and used to half-close when he was thinking. You
were so far away, and I was very lonely. Cir-
cumstances persistently threw us together. I will
tell you everything if you care to hear. . . . When
he kissed me I felt so mean to you, and yet—and
yet I let him kiss me over and over again.”
Jack rose to his feet, with an oath he took no
trouble to slur over this time. Hot words of
passionate anger and reproach rose to his lips;
but they died, birth-strangled, before the clear-
ness and force of the arguments which had
afforded him so much joy only a moment before.
He took Mona’s letter from his sweetheart’s hand
and tore it in fragments.
“I don’t want to hear any more,” he said. “I
don’t know what you think on the subject, but it
seems to me it wasn’t worth while. Let us for-
give and forget. ”
.“ Nothing like this is ever wholly forgotten,”
said Patience.
“No,’’said the man, gravely. “And that is
why it wasn’t worth while. Don’t you think so ? ”
But Patience only smiled.
ETHEL MILLIS.
Concerning Vic. Artists’ Winter Exhi-
bition :
. The show is perhaps the best yet held. But the lack of
imagination of Australian artists generally, and Vic-
torians in particular, is still manifest, for the subject-
pictures are weakly conceived, poorly composed, and
altogether lacking in their essentials. It seems extraor-
dinary that a country which suffers from no lack of
imagination or self-assurance in other arts should be
practically destitute of those qualities the moment it is
able to draw and paint. In technical skill with pencil
and brush, in harmony and color, in the decorative treat-
ment of what is commonplace to the man without the
temperament, Australia is able to stand against the
world ; but, when it comes to putting together a subject-
picture—a matter of brains and study, as well as manual
dexterity and instinctive taste, one has only to glance at
the mass of scholarship pictures to see how utterly lost is
the artist here as compared with his brother of other
lands. Broadly-speaking, there is not a subject-picture
in this exhibition worthy of the name. Portraits there
are in plenty, drawn and painted, some of them with a
freedom and skill that lead one to wonder why the artist
has not a world-reputation. Landscapes are even more
numerous and just as meritorious. Black-and-white is
handled excellently, and applied art in metal and wood
can well hold its own. It is only the subject-picture—
the only picture that reaches the great heart of the
public—that is left undeveloped. There are several
attempts based on such hackneyed themes as “ Good
News from the Front,” but all fail despite meritorious
technique. Others are merely landscapes or studies with
a few figures thrown in to try and pass off the effort as a
picture. M'Cubbin’s “Autumn” is one of these—a
decorative landscape pure and simple, and a very fine
landscape too. Bernard Hall, director of Melb. National
Gallery, exhibits the only nude, a study finished with all
the care of a picture, as all his works are. But where
are Hall’s pictures ? He has shown us none yet.
Fine draughtsman and painter though he is, he
seems as lacking in imagination as the native
artists. Perhaps it is his influence that accounts
for some of their shortcomings. His picture, on this
occasion, has a peculiar effect—stripes across the back, as
if the nymph in question had done 25 at the triangles of
Pentridge on some more or less remote occasion. Among
the portraits, the two pictures of children by Leslie
Wilkie (a young gallery student), stand out above all
others. Wilkie—a descendant of the celebrated English
artist of that name—has by these pictures jumped into
the front rank of Australian portraitist. McCubbin’s
portraits are fine bits of painting, especially that of
Loureiro, while Vincent Brun, Violet Teague, and Ina
Gregory exhibit good work. Tom Roberts’s portrait of
Marshall-Hall is an excellent likeness, but destitute of
warmth or sympathy. Portia Geach has an ambitious
figure of a girl seemingly of heroic size and 8£ heads high,
which falls short in achievement. Her decorative work,
however, is admirable, and her portrait of Donald
Macdonald is a very well-painted picture of the war-cor-
respondent in one of his stern moments—probably when
the roast dog of Ladysmith had been served up under-
done. Landscape is represented by a legion of artists,
John Ford Paterson’s mystic hazy canvasses of the
Gippsland bush being the most striking. These
are distinctly superior to his gallery picture, and
though caviare to the general stand as tribute to
Zola’s definition of art being nature seen through the
medium of a temperament. Clara Southern’s is a sort of
work that instantly arrests attention by its bold and suc-
cessful handling, and the Hampton pictures of Mr. and
Mrs. Colquhoun are good examples of impressionism in
its best sense. Percy Lindsay shows, unfortunately, but a
couple of his large collection of bush pictures. Lindsay
is an artist who has quite as much of the true feeling of
Australia as any other man. He is, in a sense, an artistic
Captain Cook, and it is a pity that his two exhibits,
excellent as they are, were not flanked by four or five
more. Miss Louisa Swan (Tas.) meets the visitor on enter-
ing with a boldly-designed and well-carved clock, and
shows her versatility further with two charming little
pictures illustrative of bits of old Sydney and Hobart.
Hal Waugh, a Geelongite, is strong on horseflesh, and
paints a draught gee-gee extremely well. Streeton gets
away from himself for a moment in a low-toned, striking
picture of Sydney harbour, all grey and white, but the
same old Streeton, more Streetonish than ever, turns
up in the water-color section in a couple of green and
scarlet splashes, clever as of yore, but essentially “ long-
range” works. Blamire Young’s decorations are very
fine . Mather, Poole, Lionel Lindsay, and May Vale show
good water-color work, and Nuttall, “Sass,” and W.
Dyson in the black-and-white section. Cobb and Sher-
love have some powerful etchings, and Tranthim Fryer
has sent along a series of repousse panels that would
stand comparison with the best. t

“While in West Australia one of us had what is known as ‘Barcoo Sick-
ness,’ due to bad food and water, together with the almost unbearable summer
heat of that colony. This disease soon puts a man in his grave unless he treats
it promptly. I came out of it in fine shape because I relied entirely on Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla for a cure.
“ Both of us have used this great remedy for boils, and sores on our arms and
hands, as a blood-purifier and general tonic, and as a .perfect antidote to fever
while in camp or at home. We both believe there is no remedy equal to this
grand old medicine we know so well.”
Bowling Bros., of 103 Hindley St., Adelaide, So. Australia, send us this letter
and the above photographs with permission to use. After such an experience
they can.certainly call Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“ The World’s Greatest Family iVSedicine.”
Be sure you get the right kind of Sarsaparilla—“Ayer’s.” Don’t let any-
body induce you to try some other kind. You will regret it if you do.
If you are not in good, vigorous health, if your nerves are not so strong as
you wish, if you are feeling run down and depressed, buy Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
today and begin the. certain cure.
