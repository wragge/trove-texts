DAWN.
Day’s sweetest moments are at dawn ;
Refreshed by his long sleep, the Light
Kisses the languid lips of Night,
Ere she can rise and hasten on.
All glowing from his dreamless rest
He holds her closely to his breast,
Warm lip to lip and limb to limb,
Until she dies for love of him.
SOLITUDE.
Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
Weep, and you weep alone;
For the sad old earth
Must borrow its mirth,
It has trouble enough of its own.
Sing, and the hills will answer ; •
Sigh, it is lost on the air ;
The echoes bound
To a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.
Rejoice, and men will seek you :
Grieve, and they turn and go :
They want full measure
Of all your pleasure,
But they do not want your woe.
Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them all;
There are none to decline
Your nectared wine,
But alone you must drink life’s gall.
Feast, and your halls are crowded;
Fast, and the world goes by ;
Succeed and give,
And it helps you live,
But it cannot help you die.
There is room in the halls of pleasure
For a long and lordly train ;
But one by one
We must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.
THE WAY OF IT.
This is the way of it, wide world over,
One is beloved, and one is the lover,
One gives and the other receives. ’
One lavishes all in wild emotion,
One offers a smile for a life’s devotion,
One hopes and the other believes.
One lies awake in the night to weep,
And the other drifts off in a sweet, sound sleep.
One soul is aflame with a godlike passion,
One plays with love in an idler’s fashion,
One speaks and the other hears.
One sobs “ I love you,” and wet eyes show it,
And one laughs lightly, and says “ I know it’”
With smiles for the other’s tears.
One lives for the other and nothing beside,
And the other remembers the world is wide.
This is the way of it, sad earth over,
The heart that breaks is the heart of the lover,
And the other learns to forget.
“For what is the use of endless sorrow ?
Though the sun goes down, it will rise to-morrow-
And life is not over yet.” ’
Oh ! I know this truth, if I know no other,
That passionate Love is Pain’s own mother.
BABYLAND.
Have you heard of the Valley of Babyland,
The realm where the dear little darlings stay,
Till the kind storks go, as all men know,
And oh, so tenderly bring them away ?
The paths are winding and past all finding
By all save the storks, who understand
The gates and the highways and the intricate by-
ways
That lead to Babyland.
All over the Valley of Babyland
Sweet flowers bloom in the soft green moss,
And under the ferns fair, and under the plants
there
Lie little heads like spools of floss.
With a soothing number the river of slumber
Blows o’er a bedway of silver sand ;
And angels are keeping watch o’er the sleeping
Babes of Babyland.
The path to the Valley of Babyland
Only the kingly, kind storks know ;
If they fly over mountains, or wade through
fountains,
No man sees them come and go.
But an angel maybe, who guards some baby,
Or a fairy, perhaps, with her magic wand,
Brings them straightway to the wonderful gate-
way
That leads to Babyland.
And there, in the Valley of Babyland,
Under the mosses and leaves and ferns.
Like an unfledged starling they find the darling
For whom the heart of a mother yearns ;
And they lift him lightly and snug him tightly
In feathers soft as a lady’s hand,
And off with a rockaway step they walk awav
Out of Babyland.
As they go from the Valley of Babyland
Forth into the world of great unrest,
Sometimes weeping he wakes from sleeping
Before he reaches the mother’s breast.
A.h, how she blesses him, how she caresses him,
Bonniest bird in the bright home band
That o’er land and water the kind stork brought
her
From far-off Babyland.
ONE OF US, TWO.
The day will dawn, when ope of us shall hearken
In vain to hear a voice that has grown dumb.
And morns will fade, noons pale, and shadows
darken,
While sad eyes watch for feet that never come.
One of us two must sometime face existence
Alone with memories that but sharpen pain,
And these sweet days shall shine back in the
distance,
Like dreams of summer dawns, in nights of rain.
One of us two, with tortured heart half broken.
Shall read long-treasured letters through salt
tears,
Shall kiss with anguished lips each cherished
token,
That speaks of these love-crowned, delicious
years.
One of us two shall find all light, all beauty,
All joy on earth, a tale forever done ;
Shall know henceforth that life means only duty.
Oh, God! Oh, God! have pity on that one.
A Passionate Poetess .
Ella wheeler wilcox in six
volumes—goodness ! And she con-
fesses to a trifle of twelve hundred
poems—gracious ! And she gives
four portraits—imprimis, the youthful El
Wheeler with girlish asms ; item, the bus
of ditto, more soulful than fleshly ; item th
married and decorated Ella Wheeler Wilcox
with her arms filled out and the fleshl
dominating the soulful; item, Ella of
recent day, with Astarte’s crescent in he
hair and the mystic Y decorating her gown-
goodness gracious ! And anybody who i
tired of wandering on the misty Celtic peaks
of Poetry will do very well to come down to
the warm valley of Ella for a change.
Ihe most popular American noetess !
Ella is that; and perhaps on the whole she
deserves to t)e. Born 45 years ago in
Wisconsin, she seems to have accumulatec
many lively memories before marrying at 29
and coming to reside at New York. And
her verses are warip. and human, strong witl
emotion and full of ideas ; yet the critics
will have none of her, and rightly-wrongly.
For specimens of her best work are re
printed on this page—including “ Delilah,’
her own favorite among 1200; and
clearly her work has not art enough to en-
dure. She is a Sappho sans phrase—with-
out the sense of words and the power ovei
words. Her numerous ideas are never far
above the commonplace ; her jarring style
drops continually below it. “Ad Finem ’
has heat enough for Swinburne ; but Swin-
burne knew how to write.
“A Sappho without style.” Very likely,
if Sappho had lived nowadays, and written
in English, she would not have had any
style. We value the ancient stylists, first,
because they are ancient—because they
come to us guaranteed by the commendation
of the ages, and our minds are prepared to
see beauties even where no beauties exist.
Secondly, because Latin or Greek were
brilliant languages to write in—the words
often shone of themselves ; the construc-
tions permitted the idea to be packed in close
compass, while even gaining intelligibility
by the concentration which gave it polish.
Thirdly, because the ancient languages are
always foreign to us, and the words are not
vulgarised by familiarity or abuse—we get
our imagination of the author’s meaning un-
mixed with baser matter. Ella Wheeler
writes in the gross, everyday English of
America ; she writes under the influence of
gross American environment ; but transpose
her across the ages with Sappho, and it is
quite possible that Ella Wheeler might ex-
hibit the more vivid poetic flame.
As things are, Ella Wheeler writes homely
verses which appeal to homely people.
“ Solitude” is a popular classic, scrap-booked
all the world over. It is not poetry, in the
highest sense ; but it brings to very many
people the highest poetical emotion they are
capable of assimilating. And there are
many among Ella’s 1200 poems which reflect
a woman’s moods, a -woman's instincts, a
woman’s longings, faithfully and interest-
ingly. Ella is “passionate,” she says, and
proud of it ; and thrice in her six volumes she
admits references to “thighs’’—shocking
many prudish American minds. She regrets
the shock, she explains ; but she can’t help
it, she is built thigh way. And her own
summary runs—
Love sent me forth, to Love I go again,
For Love is all, and over all. Amen.
In a letter to Charles Junor (a Sydney writer
and author of “ Dead Men’s Tales ”) thus Joseph
Conrad—
The principal thing is to write out of the best that is in
one. And that one can’t do every day. . . The trouble
is not in getting- paid the uttermost penny ; the trouble
is in giving good value ; in giving stuff with the truth at
the back of it; in finding the word, the sentence, the
page which satisfies one’s conscience, concretes one’s
vision, expresses the state of one’s soul and at the same
time veils the torment and pain of one’s thought. . . If
fiction is not approached in the spirit of serious devotion
then the writing of it is a fool’s business. There must be
purpose in such work. Not in the tale, but in the writer.
A “story with a purpose” is, from my point of view,
valueless artistically, and therefore it is rubbish. But he
who writes fiction with no other purpose but that of
earning a living has undertaken a contemptible task. He
will never do good work —because he will never think
worth his while to look beyond the Burface of things.
Plaudite!

Vance Thompson, brightest of American literar
interviewers and critics (in the modem fielc
regarding W. B. Yeats —
. . . that pale young Irish poet and thaumaturgist, W
B. Yeats. The name lacks sorcery. Not tha man—ther
in that red-lit room he radiated witchcraft. Long anc
lean and dark—black-eyed, black-browed, with a shock o:
black hair—dressed, too, in solemn black, he looked lik
a cross between Cagliostro and Gringoire. He has an
uncanny air of youth, and yet, the eyes that look out o
his pale face are old and visionary.
I tried to think of him as Yeats the dramatist, as Yeai
the organiser of Irish revolt, as Yeats the shrewd anc
efficient bully of the publishers—and it is impossible.
“ The poet,” he said—“ it is the function of the poet t
utter infinite mysteries and destinies.
Oho! “infinite mysteries” —now we have th
explication of Mallarme! By the way, Thomp
son, clever literary handy-man as he is, ha
fallen into Arthur Symons’s trap and pro
f esses disgust with Maupassant. “Maupas
sant,” he says, “ has all the air of a mannikin, wit]
his little acrid eyes, his frigid touch and absolut
indifference to all the phases of modern life —
grim little figure, speaking ventriloquisticallj
from a cardboard coffin.” And, you see, Thomp
son has fallen into his own trap too—the trap o
every bright writer—perpetually tempted to sacri
fice his truth to his phrase.
♦
Seems somebody has been taking our country’
name in vain again. “ Will any child,” asks Th
Athenceum,
ever miss a romp for the sake of devouring “ Australian
Wonderland,” by A.A.B. and Helumac, who tell of a liter
ary gnome
“ whose body was a book, his legs pens, and his hair and
beard all quills ; while his head was covered with an ink
stand, nicely trimmed by its open lid and a penholder ” ?
Will he delight in the artistic gnolne whose
“ was an artist’s palette, and all the rest of him wa
made of paint-brushes, mahl-sticks, palette-knives, and
tubes of paint ” ?
If he gets through the first chapter ... he may possibl
enjoy the rest of Charlie’s adventures, which are told in
style full of “ quips and cranks” and jokes most of which
miss fire. Surely the wearisome books of entertainmen
now so lavishly provided will in the end perform the gooc
service of driving children back to “Robinson Crusoe,
“ Gulliver’s Travels,” &c.
Who on Australia are “A.A.8.” and “Helumac”
♦—
Of the three partners in “Stalky and Co.,’
“ Beetle ” ,(° f course) is Kipling himself;
Stalky” is Capt. Lionel Hunsterville, Indiai:
staff officer; “McTurk” is a London artist
named Beresford—who says the book is founded
on fact and built with Kipling’s imagination.
By the way, “an Australian public-school boy
and master ” (Sydney) declares Kipling’s boys
unreal—and as for bis.masters, not one of them
would keep his billet six months in any decent
Australian school.”
The little local world of literature has been
swallowed up in the War—not a new book since
Christmas, and even the “announcements ” held
back.
Now’s the time for the local writer to clear off
his stack of books which the public won’t pur-
chase dreary novels, weary poetry, strange
science—give ’em to the absent-minded beggars
and be advertised ! °
Tour hundred minor poets in Canada ! That,
and no less, is the number mentioned in a new

many are dead—even of those who are alive.

“The great artist appropriates life, but he im-
provises, changes. A certain number of gro-
tesque or other images are invented by every
artist; but the great artist is a great externalist.
He is interested in everything. He is always
drinking with his eyes. Till he is blind and deaf
he is inexhaustible.”—Lond. Outlook.
And now the word comes that the great, the
historic house of Harpers is “in liquidation.”
“By the way,”said the customer to the book-
seller, “who is the author of the letters of
Junius?” “Well,” said the bookseller, “that’s
hardly a fair question. There’s only a few of us
have the secret, and it’s not supposed to be
known.” The customer offered blushing apologies.
Owen Seaman’s notion—
The smouldering pit with plaudits rang ;
Cophetua beamed above the throng ;
A popular comedian sang
The Absent-minded Beggar’s song,
Cophetua wagged his kingly head ;
“’T is well! ” he cried aloud—and paid ;
Then, in his beard, “ Give me,” he said,
“ The Present-bodied Beggar-maid ! ”

Sydney Opera House company exploded, as
Sydney Opera House companies will, on the very

heard G. B. Allen’s music—which (not necessarily
A.llen s) feeume declares is der Schiissel vom wei-
blichen Herzen—the key to the female heart—
administering, doubtless, that species of senti-

lovers.

DELILAH.
In the midnight of darkness and terror
When I would grope nearer to God ’
With my back to a record of error
And the highway of sin I have trod
There come to me shapes I would banish—
The shapes of the deeds I have done •
And I pray and I plead tin they vanish—
All vanish and leave me, save one.
That one with a smile like the splendor
Of the sun in the middle-day skies—
That one with a spell that is tender—
That one with a dream in her eyes—
Cometh close, in her rare Southern beauty,
Her languor, her indolent grace •
And my soul turns its back on its duty,
To live in the light of her face.
She touches my cheek, and I quiver—
I tremble with exquisite pains ;
She sighs—like an overcharged river
My blood rushes on through my veins
She smiles—and in mad-tiger fashion,
As a she-tiger fondles her own,
I clasp her with fierceness and passion,
And kiss her with shudder and groan.
Once more, in our love’s sweet beginning
I put away God and the World;
Once more, in the joys of our sinning,
Are the hopes of eternity hurled.
There is nothing my soul lacks or misses
As I clasp the dream-shape to my breast •
In the passion and pain of her kisses
Life blooms to its richest and best.
O ghost of dead sin unrelenting,
Go back to the dust, and the sod !
Too dear and too sweet for repenting,
Ye stand between me and my God,
It X, by the Throne, should behold you,
Smiling up with those eyes loved so well,
Close, close in my arms I would fold you,
drop with you down to sweet Hell )
AD FINEM.
On the white throat of the useless passion
That scorched my sou] with its burning breath
I clutched my fingers in murderous fashion,
And gathered them close in a grip of death •
For why should I fan, or feed with fuel,
A love that showed me but blank despair?
So my hold was firm, and my grasp was cruel—
I meant to strangle it then and there !
I thought it was dead. But with no warning,
It rose from its grave last night, and came 6 ’
And stood by my bed till the early morning,
And over and over it spoke your name.
Its throat was red where my hands had held it,
It burned my brow with its scorching breath;
And I said, the moment my eyes beheld it, ’
“ A love like this can know no death.”
For just one kiss that your lips have given
In the lost and beautiful past to me,
I would gladly barter my hopes of Heaven
And all the bliss of Eternity.
For never a joy are the angels keeping
To lay at my feet in Paradise,
Like that of into your strong arms creeping,
And looking into your love-lit eyes.
I know, in the way that sins are reckoned,
This thought is a sin of the deepest dye ;
But I know, too, if an angel beckoned,
Standing close by the Throne on High,
And you, adown by the gates infernal,
Should open your loving arms and smile,
I would turn my back on things supernal,
To lie on your breast a little while.
To know for an hour you were mine completely—
Mine in body and soul, my own—
I would bear unending tortures sweetly,
With not a murmur and not a moan.
A lighter sin or a lesser error
Might change through hope or fear divine;
But there is no fear, and hell has no terror
To change or alter a love like mine.
ART AND HEART.
Though critics may bow to art, and I am its own
true lover,
It is not art, but heart, which wins she wide world
over.
Though smooth be the heartless prayer, no ear in
Heaven will mind it,
And the finest phrase falls dead, if there is no feel-
ing behind it.
Though perfect the player’s touch, little if any he
sways us,
Unless we feel his heart throb through the music
he plays us.
Though the poet may spend his life in skilfully
rounding a measure,
Unless he writes from a full warm heart, he gives
us little pleasure.
So it is not the speech which tells, but the impulse
which goes with the saying,
And it is not the words of the prayer, but the
yearning back of the praying.
It is not the artist’s skill, which into our soul
comes stealing
With a joy that is almost pain, but it is the
player’s feeling.
And it is not the poet’s song, though sweeter than
sweet bells chiming,
Which thrills us through and through, but the
heart which beats under the rhyming.
And therefore I say again, though I am art’s own
true lover,
That it is not art, but heart, which wins the wide
world over.

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
gd
MEDICATOR.
/''lATARRII is inflammation of the
'- y ' lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flammation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to tiie head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the sight and
hearing, destroys the sense of taste
and smell, renders the breath offen-
sive, breaks down the affected
tissues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the small
frontal bones of the skull. The putrid
discharge passing through the lungs
anil stomach causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. I)o you want relief and
cure? If so, try our great remedy. It
has no equal.

The origin of the term “ Tommy Atkins
for tlie British army “private” : —“ln the smal
book in which his accounts are kept, his clothing
entered, next of kin, and so on, there is a speci
men page to show how the accounts are to be en
tered, and Thomas Atkins is the mythical sol-
dier whose signature is given. Fora time this wa?
changed to Edward Fitzgerald, or some similai
high-sounding name, but the service laughed so
much and scoffed so at the name that Thomas
Atkins has resumed his place in the books.” Pre-
vious to the Kipling era the term was little known
outside of the service, and the men—Scotch,
Irish, and Welsh, as well as the distinctly nominal
English—bandied it in its business sense. Nowa-
days it is somewhat objected to as a Kiplingesque
misrepresentation of every sort of soldier except
the aitchless town-bred Tommy who is certainly
not the backbone of the army. The “private”
that Kiplin" created would appear to have l>een
invariably born somewhere near the Milo End
Road in an atmosphere of gin and saveloys and
korfy stalls.

The Singer.
Through his prison-cage bars peeping,
Lo ! a songster dreaming there
Saw the East-wind gently sweeping
Through the folds of Nature s hair <
Saw it wanton in her bosom,
Where the rosebuds vigil keep,
Till it rocked each restless blossom
With an even-song to sleep;
Saw it journey to the dying
Of the perfumed summer-day,
Till the clouds before it lying
Glowed and burned and fled away J
Watched it till at last the gloaming,
Spreading from the Eastern skies,
O’er the face of Nature roaming,
Closed her earth-eternal eyes.
Then, on feet of fire quick-marching,
Came one rich, relucent gleam—
Swift as bow of heaven arching—
Inspiration of his dream.
And the air-waves quiver’d, ringing
With a wedded song anil sigh,
As the songster started singing
Of the East-wind's lullaby ;
And the stars came out to greet him,
And the full moon, blushing, told
How the echoes longed to meet him
In her wondrous heart of gold ;
And the East-wind, backward turning,
Brought a message from the West,—
“Sing again your song of yearning,
Over there they long for rest 1 ”
And the songster’s caged wings fluttered—
Eager on what clouds to float ?
But the bars 1 . . . the song he uttered
Turned to frenzy in his threat.
Then the mammon-child that fed him,
Heedless of the piercing pain—
To the dee|>er darkness led him
Where the souls of silence reign ;
And the East-wind, gazing after,
Turned again unto the West —
To escape the bitter laughter
Of a night-hawk in her nest.
MILKY WHITE.
Remains.
The holidays nre over now at last,
And picnic-time lias Hitted flitted fast;
And in solemn thought I stand
By a lone and silent strand,
And watch the empty bottles drifting past.
Three thousand years ago, or more, maybe,
The Preacher said that all was Vanity ;
And while gazing on such scenes,
And so many dead marines,
I’m tempted with the Preacher to agree.
Where now has all the wit and humor gone,
That flourished when the corks were gaily drawn?
Like the froth upon the glass
It lias vanished—and, alas !
No change is given by Oblivion.
O'er all the land, wherever shade is found,
The signs of human presence lie around.
Empty bottles, empty tins,
Orange-rinds, banana-skins,
Like leaves in Vallombrosa strew the ground.
I know that there are folk who like to state
That Nature’s calm these relics violate,
But to me a spent cigar
Teaches lessons deeper far
Than running brook, or stone, or Ocean great.
The youthful lovers who, with rapture crowned,
In happy scores and hundreds sat around,
Drinking tea, or drinking beer,
At the starting of the year—
When comes the year’s end where will they be
found ?
Upon the banks of many a creek and bay
Are mounds of oyster-shells that, people say,
Were accumulated so
By the natives long ago—
Those oyster-eating natives, where are they ?
Man has a high opinion of his worth,
But, surely, ’tis a theme for grimmest mirth
Just to think an oyster-shell,
Or a salmon-tin, may well
Last longer far than he upon the earth!
I wonder if, when Man his race has run.
And Earth swings dead around a dying sun,
Some bright visitor may stray
From a fixed star far away,
And muse upon Remains —as I have done.
The palaces, the theatres so gay,
The churches and the forts in grim array—
In the hurry of mankind
To depart, left all behind,
Should give him food for thinking, one would say.
I picture him a Personage obese,
But gaseous —a sort of Ghost of Grease ;
And I fancy that I can
Hear him say of Vanished Man—
*He’s had his Picnic—let him rest in Peace !”

To the Editor of the Evenino News.
Sir, —As Dr. Thompson, chief of the Health
Department, has announced the disease of the
bubonic germs in rats, one thing is now certain,
that dogs and cats will become the chief vehicles
of transmission to man, not only because of their
disposition to hunt and kill rats, but also because
many of them feed on the dead rats, and because
dogB and cats are often found sniffing round rat-
holes and among straw where rats have been.
All fondling of dogs and cats should for the pre-
sent cease. Certainly, all children found nursing
and kissing cats and dogs should be reproved.
Very great cleanliness must now become the order
of the day. If the authorities established public
dog-baths, this would be much more beneficial
than chasing rats.

That Freetrade Conference.
The old ghosts of the old Freetrade party
lately gathered themselves together to con-
sider ways and means for afflicting the
Commonwealth with the curse of their poli-
tical creed. It wasn’t a very imposing
assemblage, nor a very large one, neither was
it strikingly unanimous. And its members
were in the main a rather inferior advertise-
ment for a policy which is to make the world
affluent and happy, and which is alleged to
represent such a very large mass of the
world’s intelligence. It w r as to a great ex-
tent a gathering of respectable, elderly
failures—political, commercial, and other-
wise. Looking at the crowd it seemed to
suggest that the kind of intelligence which
mostly believes in Freetrade as a means
towards sordid success isn’t the kind which
achieves much sordid success itself. Success
is a very sordid thing ; still when the N. S. W.
Freetrade party declares that its policy leads
to the dross and corruption of wealth, and
when it has had so many years of office in
which to bring about the financial results
which it is always going to produce, it seemed
a pity that these representatives weren't a
trifle more bloated. The man who sells an
infallible hair-restorer shouldn’t be per-
sonally bald. Hair may be sordid and com-
monplace ; still the man who knows exactly
how to produce it should be well thatched.
* * * *
The purpose of the Conference was to
arrange for making Federated Australia
either a purely Freetrade state or a Revenue
Tariff state. If it is a purely Freetrade state
then it is painfully obvious that another
£8,000,000, or something approaching that
sum, must be raised by direct taxation, for
not only must the present customs revenue
and any extra cost arising through Federa-
tion b~ made good by direct taxation,
but the excise revenue must be simi-
larly replaced. For, if customs duties
are abolished, excise must go also.
If imported liquor and tobacco come
in free, then to tax locally-produced
liquor and tobacco wouldn’t create revenue ;
it would merely destroy the local industries.
Even the wildest enthusiast would hardly
drink tanglefoot if British beer was cheaper.
An income-tax of 2s. in the £ and a land-tax
of 6d. in the £ of capital value or 10s. in the
£ of rental would probably fill the gap, but
the conference made no serious attempt to
deal with these alarming details of the pro-
blem. Though it was a Freetrade Confer-
ence, only a very small part of it wanted
absolute Freetrade, and even that part of it
didn’t say where the money was to come
from. It was, in the main, a Revenue Tariff
Conference. The difference between Re-
venue Tariffism and Protection is simple
enough. The Revenue Tariff man says it is
a bad thing to raise money by customs duties,
but does it ; the Protectionist says it is a good
thing to raise revenue by customs duties,
and does it. Also, they raise about the
same amount, and take about the same sum
out of the people’s pockets, and heap the
same burden on the people’s backs ; but the
Protectionist promises that his system of
doing it will create local industries and fur-
nish employment, and the Revenue Tariffist
assures the people that his system won’t
create local industries and won’t furnish em-
ployment. The latter, by the way, denies
the Protectionist’s theories, and declares
that the Protectionist’s fiscal policy doesn't
create industries. He says it merely pro-
duces the same results as his own Revenue
Tariff policy, which doesn’t create industries
either. And he says that Revenue Tariffism
is good because it does exactly what he says
Protection does ; and that Protection is
bad and horrible and a national curse and
sin because he says it does exactly what
Revenue Tariffism does.
* * • *
The gathering of bald men who were sell-
ing the infallible hair-restorer also laid down
the good old maxim that Protection is inju-
rious to the working-classes, and involves
them in all manner of woe. But in this
respect the remorseless logic of time and cir-
cumstances is all against them. The only
provinces which have State Land Banks are
Protectionist, The only one with a mini-
mum-wage law is Protectionist. The only
ones with efficient Factory Acts are Protec-
tionist. The single province which has
abolished strikes by compulsory conciliation
is a strictly Protectionist province ; and it is
also the one which led the way in abolishing
long hours of labor, the only one with an
efficient law for the protection of sailors, the
one which most effectually prevents the
attachment of workmen's wages, and the
one which has done something to abolish the
middleman in public works and transfer his
profits to the actual workers. Also, it is a
strictly Protectionist province which alone
found that it had money enough to establish
an Old Age Pension system, and the pro-
vinces which have adopted a system of
breaking up large estates in order to supply
abundance of good land for the people are
all Protectionist. Either these things arise
from Protection, or else the people who
have brains enough to do them have also
brains enough to be Protectionist. And the
one allegedly Freetrade province, which had
50 years start of most of the others, which
enjoys the biggest land revenue and the
biggest coal deposits and the largest mineral
income, has done about as little for the
worker as any. Its shameful lagging behind
in social reform may not arise out of its semi-
Freetrade policy, but at least the two things
have gone together. And when the Freetrade
party lays it down as a self-evident proposi-
tion that Freetrade is the only road to social
reform, and yet the only Freetrade province
of the group is also the one with about the
least social reform to show for its age, the
case of the perfectly bald men selling the
infallible hair-restorer isn’t a circumstance
to it for effrontery.
• * * *
If Australia was in the same position as
England —if it had built up its industries by
200 years of Protection, and acquired a
mortgage over all the globe by 300 years of
conquest and plunder—if the outer world
owed it some £200,000,000 instead of it
owing the outer world £200,000,000 —if it
had £7,000,000 a year interest coming in
instead of £7,000,000 a year interest
going out, which would mean a differ-
ence of £14,000,000 a year, or about
enough to allow of everybody’s wages being
doubled, for money changes hands so rapidly
that a very small wage-fund is sufficient to
pay a very large amount in wages—then
things might be different. Britain gets on
without Protection because it is enor-
mously subsidised by other countries in
the shape of interest-payments. Britain is
the old woman with a large annuity while
Australia is the old woman who takes in
washing and has a bill of sale over her
furniture. The circumstances that fit Britain
don’t fit Australia. If the Commonwealth
goes in for real Freetrade it must needs lay
an enormous direct tax on its own land
(which is another way of saying that it must
lay an enormous indirect tax on the produce
of its own land) while it lets the produce of
other people’s land come in free. Under
absolute Freetrade its people must work
as long hours and for as low wages
as their cheapest adjacent competitors if
their industries are to last. If some Asiatic
workman is prepared to work 12 hours a day
for 10s. a week at making some given article,
it is no use for the Australian under Free-
trade to expect 40s. a week for eight hours a
day spent in making the same article, for the
Jap importations would sooner or later kill
his industry dead in the matter of cheap-
ness. And the N.S.W. Freetrader knows
this well. The apparent reason why N.S.W.
lags so far behind Protectionist Maoriland in
the matter of social reform is simply that
you can’t give the workman shorter hours
and higher wages without, to some extent,
increasing the cost of his product, and you
can’t increase the cost of his product under
Freetrade without leaving his industry
liable to sudden extinction through the com-
petition of some foreign country where hours
are longer, and wages shorter, and produc-
tion consequently cheaper.
* * * *
The Bulletin would have turned Free-
trader long ago if the N.S.W. Freetrade
party had lived up to its theories. It will
do it yet if the N.S.W. Freetrade party will
live up to its theories now. In N.S.W.
sugar, glucose, molasses, treacle, biscuits,
confectionery and fruits all represent highly-
protected industries. Beer is largely pro-
tected ; so is the tobacco industry. If the
N.S.W. Freetraders had had the courage to
remove the protective duties on all these
things, and to go in for genuine Freetrade,
and if, at the same time, they had adopted
the social legislation of Maoriland and the
minimum wage law of Victoria, and the
N.S.W. industries, under these conditions,
had not gone down slump but had
gone on expanding, this paper would
have turned Freetrader. The Freetrade
party alleges that under its system it is
possible to give the workman better condi-
tions and more employment than he can get
under Protection. This paper doesn’t ask
so much as that. It only asks that the Free-
trade party will give N.S.W. working
classes exactly the same conditions that are
enjoyed in Maoriland, that it will give them
coupled with genuine, absolute Freetrade,
and that its industries will then keep grow-
ing as fast as do the industries of Maoriland.
That won’t prove that Freetrade is better
than Protection, but it will prove that it is
as good, and this paper will be satisfied
with that. But Maoriland preaches and
practises Protection, while the N.S.W.
Freetraders preach Freetrade and have never
dared to practise it. And when the bald
man is afraid to try his own hair-restorer,
how can he expect men with hair to believe
in it ?
The State versus the Private Mono-
polist—Once More.
The general sentiment of Australia is in favor of
the great popular services of transport and com-
munication being controlled by Government on
behalf of the people. The Australian Govern-
ments own the Australian railways, and, as a rule,
refuse to permit interference by private mono-
poly. Australia’s experience of private railways
has been disastrous. The Australian Govern-
ments own the post-offices, telegraphs, and tele-
phones, and refuse to permit interference by pri-
vate monopoly. On the whole, though State
ownership is not always ideally satisfactory, the
Australian sentiment is that in respect of the great
services referred to it is far preferable to private
ownership.
* * * *
But there is one signal exception to the Aus-
tralian rule of Government control. It is in the
matter of the cables to Europe. These are owned
by private capitalists, with that great monopoly,
the Eastern Extension Telegraph Co., at the head
of them. That co. used to charge Australia a
cable-rate of Bs. per word, and it waxed fat on its
monopoly. It has paid heavy dividends, and
accumulated colossal reserves of money and
material. Even now, when the rate is reduced to
an average of 4s. 9d. per word, it continues to
fatten at Australia’s expense. For the traffic
would pay at 3s. per word, or less. The Eastern
Extension Co. is making a surplus profit of at
least Is. 9d. per word—a surplus profit, over and
above a fair working profit.
And the communication with Europe is wholly
westward, through various fpreign hands and
lands. All the traffic of the United States and
Canada goes round about, through Europe. Yet
direct communication with the American contin-
ent would unquestionably be very beneficial to
Australia and the trade of Australia. Besides,
while Australia is connected with Britain, and
especially now when Australia has emphasised
the connection with Britain, it is felt that a cable
wholly under British and Australian control,
directly under Govt, control, is almost a necessity.
For consider the case of a European war.
* * * *
So, a while ago, the project of a Pacific cable was
mooted, the land portion to go entirely through
Australian and Canadian territory. That would
save money, increase trade, help to secure safety.
And the Eastern provinces of Australia (subject to
Parliament’s ratification) agreed with Canada and
Britain to lay a cable. South Australia and Westra-
lia stood out. They are possibly better served by the
existing cables; and South Australia, with her land
lines, is interested in supporting the existing
cables because she makes a profit on all East Aus-
tralian messages. Seven pence a word is South
Australia’s toll on Eastern messages to-day. She
would lose it for all Pacific messages, were the
Pacific cable laid. Besides, the Adelaide broker
is now about an hour nearer London than the
Sydney broker—a great advantage in speculation
—an advantage which the Pacific cable would
destroy. So South Australia stands out.
* * * *
Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria, Maoriland—by
the mouths of their Governments —stand in. They
are to pay four-ninths of the Pacific cable cost;
Canada and Britain are to pay five-ninths between
them. The South Australian Govt., which natu-
rally takes the least sanguine view of things, esti-
mates that, if the cost of cabliny is reduced to 3s.
per word—an immense saving to the community
on 4s. 9d. —each of the four contributing provinces
will lose £12,000 a year if one cable is laid,
and £26,500 if two cables are laid —this loss to
become a profit in ten years. The friends of the
Pacific cable are naturally more sanguine, but
there will probably be some loss for the first few
years. Only— these are the compensations—the
Govts, own the cable, and the people, not private
monopolists, stand to make the profit sooner or
later; the cable is entirely under Australian,
Canadian, and British control; trade with the
American continent is directly benefited ; and—
the present cablin'i-cost is reduced by Is. 9d. a word.
The cable could be laid in three years or less from
the word ‘ ‘ Go ! ”
* * * *
This scheme looks like good business. No won-
der the Eastern Extension Co. trembles. That
co. has many “ pulls ” over influential Australians.
It has taken pains to conciliate them. Its stock-
holders have, apparently, many “pulls” over
Australian friends. And, seeing the destruction
of its monopoly menaced, the Eastern Extension
Co. has laid a Bait. This is the Bait.
* * * m
The monopolist co. offers to lay a new line to
the Cape. That suits South Australia; it leaves
the Eastern provinces and the American trade as
they were. Eurther, it offers to reduce the cable-
charge to 4s. per word when its present agreement
ends in April next. Further, it offers, if the
average Australian cable income for three con-
secutive years is £350,000 per annum, to come
down another 6d.—then another fid. for another
such year, and another for another, so that if the
receipts keep up to £350,000, the rate may be
only 2s. 6d. per word in 1903. But it isn’t likely.
For, observe the monopolist’s artfulness. At
4s. 9d. the profits of three years like 1899 won’t
reach £350,000 ; is it likely, then, they will reach
it at 4s. ? Or, if they do, is it likely they will
reach it at 3s. 6d. And mark that one lean year
may kill two fat years’ chances. For the receipts
must keep up for three consecutive years. So
the harder the donkey gallops the farther away
the carrots will be. The choice is really
between the monopolists’ 4s. a word for (probably)
a long time to come, and the Pacific 3s. a word m
three years—if Australia likes, plus the Pacific ad-
vantages, minus the initial Pacific losses.
• * • *
And the monopolist co. wants just a leetle con-
cession as well—in order to enable it to compete
advantageously with the Govt, cable, and do its
darnedest to ruin the people’s business. It wants
to run private offices of its own, and tout for
trade in opposition to the Govt, cable. Ho we
allow that with the railways ? Or the
post - offices ? Or the interprovincial tele-
graphs ? Or the telephones ? Not much. But
the co. reckons if it gets this concession it can
fight and ruin the Pacific cable, the Govt, cable,
in various ways. It can pay lower wages than
Govt., and run its business more cheaply. It can
give big firms special contracts at cut prices—
which it can’t do if the messages are received at
Govt, offices at a standard price per word. It can
make a temporary loss to ruin the Govt, cable,
while continuing to pay dividends out of the funds
piled-up from exorbitant rates in the past. And
there you are.
* * * *
Queensland won’t swallow the bait. Maoriland
won’t. Victoria won’t. In N.S.W. the Reid
Govt, refused it. But the Lyne Govt, is nibbling.
Postmaster-General Billy Crick is weeping on
the bosom of the monopolist. Does he know any-
thing about the facts ? Or are his permanent
officials bullying him — for reasons? The Bul-
letin wants to know. Anyway, if Postmaster-
General Billy Crick, with the approval of his
Govt., wrecks the Pacific cable and runs N.S.W.
once more into the exclusive power of that
brilliant monopolist, the Eastern Extension Co.—
well, there will be trouble. Ask G. Reid.
“A Vanishing Asset.”
E. D. Millen, M.L.C., lately toured western
N.S.W. to spy out the leanness of that droughty
land ; and the most striking part of what he saw,
along with what he thought, he afterwards put
into eight or ten S.M. Herald columns, which
have since been reprinted and scattered broad-
cast. In the N.S.W. Parliament there are 40 ex-
perts in land laws and “ pastoral problems ; ” and
the whole 40 agree only in unanimously disagree-
ing with one another. Millen, however, has
been a wideawake and almost lifelong resident in
the thick of the pastoral backblocks ; and partly
on that account, and partly because he has been
all through the distressful country, he has a better
right to talk and a better claim to be heard
than most of the other 39. It is a pitiful
story he has to tell. Roughly, in nine
years the number of sheep in this western
district has fallen from 12,000,000 to 6,000,000.
In the Broken Hill sub-district runs, which in ’94
stocked 135,765 sheep, had 30,665 left in ’99.
Around Cobar, where in ’94 there were 123,672
sheep, in ’99 there were 30,673; and a group of
Wilcannia holdings for which Mr. Millen had
figures, showed an awful slump in the same five
years from 61,529 to 18,561. Still the loss of stock
is not more serious than the deterioration of the
country; and that is just where the State comes
in, because this country is one of the State’s chief
assets. The “poor squatter,” no doubt, deserves
a lot of sympathy ; in patches he has had a dread-
ful time. But the poor public deserves a bit, too ;
for if the tenant has lost his sheep, the landlord
has had his estate more or less ruined. And the
plain, blunt truth is that the “poor squatter,”
though in the end he may have found himself a
victim of circumstances, is directly responsible
for spoiling the country, inasmuch as the damage
is the result, not of drought, but of overstocking.
• * * •
That overstocking is at the bottom of the trouble
is Mr. Millen’s conclusion also ; and he says, in
effect, that the “one way in which such country
can be permanently and profitably occupied ” is to
take the prevailing drought-conditions as normal,
and fix the rent and the conditions of occupation
accordingly. The common plea, of course, is that
the Government has fixed the rents too high. But
the rents have had very little to do with the
number of stock carried. If the Government ap-
praiser estimated a run as being capable of fairly
carrying a sheep to 20 acres, yet if there was, at
any time, enough grass or scrub to keep a sheep to
five acres, the squatter crowded on the greater
number if he could get them. No matter what
the rent-basis was, the squatter put on in
good seasons as many stock as he could
feed and water ; and on that basis he bought and
sold stations, and borrowed the money to pay for
them. And it was on that basis lie still had to
pay interest when the slump in the price of wool,
&c., came along. To counterbalance the fall in
price he crowded on still more sheep ; and after
the too-numerous sheep had engaged in a fierce
competition for the diminishing grass, a few
millions of rabbits came in with a claim to all of
it they could get. No edible thing had a chance
to grow ; no seeding plant was allowed to repro-
duce itself, and a break-down in the first spell of
drought was inevitable. Mr. Millen, who is
chiefly intent on extracting better terms for the
squatter from the State, has a passing sneer at ex-
Lands-Minister CARIfUTHERS— who, having greatly
reduced these Western rents, suggested that in-
terest-charges should also be reduced. But in
spite of the sneer, it has been in the desperate


endeavor to make sixpenny wool pay a high rate
of interest on the excessive loans negotiated when
wool was at a shilling or so and when there was
no rabbit-plague, that nine western stations out of
ten have been overstocked, and in the process
more or less ruined.
• ■* • *
As usual, the State, in spite of its own great
losses, is now expected to help the squatter out of
his troubles. He has shockingly ill-used the land
in the past; and in spoiling it he has got himself
into difficulties as well. Therefore Mr. Millen
suggests, as remedies, that the same squatter
should have the land more absolutely given over
to him to do as he pleases with it; that we should
guarantee to let him have it for a much longer
time than has been allowed hitherto ; and that the
average rent should be less. All this, no doubt,
is intended to show our gratitude for the good care
which he has taken of our estate—to show our high
appreciation of him as a tenant! It seems
an almost monstrous thing to ask the State to do
so; yet the State is in so tight a place that it can-
not afford to refuse many things that the squatters
(or Mr. Millen for them) choose to ask. That is,
if the province wants the country occupied ; and,
though the return per square mile is small, the
area is so great and aggregate returns so large that
the province cannot a ford to have this fourth of
its area abandoned and idle. After all, though, as
to the concessions asked, it really matters very
little whether the lease of this far-out country is
for 18 years or 28 years, so long as the land is
fairly used. But there are tens of millions of acres
of this land which are not leased at all; the land is
merely held from week to week under license,
ostensibly in order that it may be available
for “closer settlement.” To refuse a' fair
lease of tens of millions of acres of semi-
desert country for the sake of keeping
open a few thousand acres of a little less awful
country is a most clumsy method ; and it does not
seem any better when it is remembered that the
whole lot, the awful and the leather less awful,
may by this plan be permanently damaged through
being occupied without the necessary improve-
ments. Nevertheless, with all the concessions
made to the squatter, there would still be no
guarantee whatever that the deterioration of the
land would stop ; and that is what the public
needs to see about —for it surely doesn’t want any
more of this asset to vanish. The problem thus is
how to allow the squatter to profitably occupy the
land while preventing him from further damaging
it by overstocking. And that does not seem im-
possible, for if the State lets its land on the basis
as to rent, &c., that drought is the normal condi-
tion, it surely has a right to insist that the land
shall only be stocked on that basis, too.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tasmania’s Great Western Horror.
One day, recently, an honest man named Patter-
son upended himself to tell a Tasmanian audience
the unspeakable truth about the land-grant railway
syndicate which, four years ago, got a concession
from a weak-minded Government to build the
famous Great Western Railway, and which has
never started it to this day. Said truth has been
told before, but it is the sort of truth which can’t
be told too often. The Great Western is a line
which the State could build itself, according to
the calculations of its own officials, for something
like £300,000, this to include locomotives, car-
riages, trucks, and all sundries. The incredible
syndicate asked, first of all, for an immense land-
grant —something like a million acres—which,
when the line is built and the country thereby
opened up, ought to sell for about enough to pay
the whole cost of the railway, if the State built it.
It also, asked that the State should guarantee the
interest on £200,000 worth of the syndicate’s
debentures, without any security whatever for
its money. To guarantee the interest on the
co.’s debentures is just the same in the end as
if the State borrowed the money itself and
guaranteed the interest on its own debentures, so
between the land grant and the guarantee the
State was asked to pay or become responsible for
about £BOO,OOO and not own the line or get the
profits, whereas by becoming responsible for only
£600,000 it could build and own the line itself.
The promoters demanded from the public £895,000
in cash and shares for themselves as clear profit—
£B9s,ooo for their trouble in floating a co. to build
a line worth, with rolling-stock and all equip-
ments, only £600,000 in all. The nominal capital
of the company was to be £2,400,000 —so many
people were to have something for themselves out
of the scheme, that it was estimated the line
would cost four times as much if built by the co.
as it would if built by the State. And as the
people of Tasmania must needs find the money in
freights and fares to pay interest on the cost,
the result would be, supposing both parties
were content with 3 per cent., that the State
would try to screw £lB,OOO a year out of the people
over and above working expenses, while the co.
would try to screw out £72,000 a year. There is
to be a general election very shortly in Tasmania,
and if the Hobart people, who are deeply interested
in getting the Great Western Rail way, can only
wake up in time they have a grand opportunity
before them. The proposition they should make
is simple enough to be understood by even the
slowest Tasmauian understanding. It is that,
when the G.W. concession expires, which it does
in a few months, the State should abjure all
syndicates for the future ; that it should build the
line itself and do it at once ; that it should give
the railway department the same land-grant that
it promised the private railway co., the revenue
from the land to be used to supplement the
earnings of the line just as they would have been
if the private co. had built it; and when the earn-
ings and the land revenue together more than
cover working expenses and interest the surplus to
go in reduction of the general railway deficit. If
the State can endow other people’s railways with
land grants it is quite as simple and legitimate
and logical to endow its own. And a £600,000
State railway requires a lot less endowment to
make it pay than the same line in private hands,
when promoters’ profits and other things have so
swelled the expense that it has become a £2,400,000
affair.
4,
The Dirty City of Sydney.
A FEARFULLY and wonderfully constructed thing
is the municipal government of Sydney, and it is
difficult to say whether it is more wonderful when
it is reforming or when it is letting things slide.
Sydney is a very disreputable-looking and —so far
as its public treasury is concerned —stone-broke
city. It has accumulated a municipal deficit of
over £120,000, solely because its aldermen hadn’t
the moral courage to put up the rates to a figure
that would cover expenses. This is in addition to
a debt of about a million and a-half, partly for
public works and partly arising through previous
shortages, and also saying nothing of a previous
debt which the bankrupt city induced the State
to take over many years ago. In addition to
getting deeper and deeper and more hopelessly
into debt, Sydney has been falling into fearful
decay of late years, till there are holes in George-
street where a goat might almost fall in and be
lost, and the sanitation of the filthy metropolis
has been more and more neglected till, as a natural
result, the Plague is battering at the Cornstalk’s
front door. And at long last Sydney has resolved
to reform a little. On the old municipal rate of
Is. 4d. in the £ the deficit for this year promised
to be £24,000. By putting the rate up to Is. 7d.
there was every prospect of making ends meet.
By putting it up to Is. lOd. it would have been
possible not only to make ends meet but to
allow £lO,OOO extra to make good the awful
dilapidations which have accumulated in past
years, and £14,000 to reduce the past deficits. But
Sydney Corporation isn’t built that way. It has
decided to make a great effort, however—that is
to say, what it considers a great effort—and put up
the rate to Is. fid. in the £. This will leave
the old deficit where it is, leave no
surplus for making good the accumulated
dilapidations of late years, and supply no
extra funds for cleaning purposes in view
of the bubonic visitant who is now with
us. It won’t even make provision for ade-
quately stopping these huge holes in George-
street in which the electric tram will founder some
day with all hands. And it still leaves a deficit
of £3OOO or thereabouts. But—and here lies the
beauty and special glory of the business—Mayor
Harris hopes to save this amount by economies,
largely in the matter of the cleansing vote.
With the plague already in Sydney city this is a
specially beautiful time to economise,the cleansing
vote. And all this dirt and debt and unloveliness
arise because the allegedly rich metropolis is too
mean or too cowardly to face a rate of Is. lOd. or
2s. in the £. There is no way to keep a city clean
and attractive without plenty of money,
especially when, owing to long years of
shirk, about half Sydney’s municipal income
goes to pay interest and charges on old
debts. It is possible to have a city dirty and neg-
lected with plenty of money and bad management,
but even good management won’t prevent it
being dirty and neglected without plenty of
money. So the aldermen of Sydney, and the
people who are responsible for the aldermen, have
to choose between paying up or leaving their city
unclean and uncomely. And they deliberately
choose dirt and ugliness and plague rather than
pay up.

Tickling 1 the Public Vanity.
The following, from a recent Sydney Telegraph
leader, is a quaint example of the fool’s paradise
variety of logic :
There are patriotic panic-mongers who deduce from the
Boer war the lesson that Australia is in a state of military
helplessness, and who urge the immediate adoption of
such measures as would be justified if an enemy were
already thundering at our gates. To cooler-headed people,
however, the events transpiring in South Africa convey
just the opposite suggestion. They show that the task of
subjugating two small but remote states, to which the
British have the entree by land from their own territory,
is sufficient to impose a severe strain on the resources of
the strongest power in the world. Any European nation
which attempted the conquest of Australia would have to
transport its forces twice the distance from London to
Pretoria, and after landing them deal with a community
several times as large as the Boers, and at least equally as
warlike. If the Boer war is to be a criterion, the ability
to land and maintain an army sufii dent for this purpose
would not be possessed by half Europe in combination.
This sort of pap flattters the Australian vanity, no
doubt, and therefore it is pleasant reading and
profitable printing. But it is fool’s logic all the
same. To be warlike it is not only necessary to
be willing to fight, but also to know how to fight,
and to have the needful apparatus. Practically
all the Transvaal Boers over 40, and
many of the younger ones as well, have
seen war and know the rudiments of the
art ; the same description applies to about
one adult male Australian in 100. Practically
every Boer can shoot—well or moderately, and
alrno it every one has sufficient military equipment
to enable him to go out at a day’s notice as a
reasonably capable soldier. Also, the bulk of the
Boer nation consists of countrymen, and there is a
military organisation so perfect that every man
capable of bearing arms can be called out in a
week. An immense proportion of Australians
can’t shoot worth a cent. Probably not one in 100
could turn out at a day’s notice as the Boer far-
mer can, equipped as a capable mounted-infantry-
man. Already nearly half the Australian people
are dwellers in cities and large towns. There is
no organisation for calling out the population if
wanted, no adequate supply of officers to command
them, no arrangements for arming or mounting
them if called out, no commissariat system —noth-
ing but a handful of regular troops and behind
them chaos. Probably all the million Aus-
tralians couldn’t, at the same notice, give
anything like so good an account of themselves
as the paltry 150,000 Boers. It took Australia
about six times longer to get 1500 men ready than
it took the Boer republics to get 40,000, yet Aus-
tralia has about 20 times the resources to draw
upon. Even then, part of the force was sent out
armed with obsolete rifles, and the province which
sent its men to hump a sort of old Brown Bess into
Africa admitted that, in doing so, it had practi-
cally used up all its military stores, and had no
idea what to do next. The chances are that
Sydney, Melbourne an 1 Adelaide could all be
taken, looted and destroyed by half the force that
is required to capture Pretoria. If there was a
good leader at the head of the invaders, it is just
possible that a quarter the force would suffice.
To be Hanged By the Neck.
Even callous Melbourne got a shock re-cently
when Henry Hodges sentenced three per-
sons to death in one day. Consideration of the
three cases chiefly serves to emphasise the simple
—not to say rough-and-ready—methods and the
violent one-sidedness of Justice. It will be ob-
served that the Crown always prosecutes. It’s a
way the Crown has ; and, except in capital cases,
it never defends. In such cases it has, only of re-
cent years, provided a good or indifferent or tenth-
rate barrister to defend, but it has never been able
to perceive the justice of utilising the police and
detectives in the interests of the accused equally
as much as against him. The discovering of the
actual facts regarding a crime is about the
last thing it dreams of doing. In the case
of Jones, convicted of the Broadford murder, his
clothes had been examined by the Govt, analyst
without finding any bloodstains thereon, and he
wasn’t captured in the ordinary sense of the term
—hearing that he was suspected he walked into a
police-station and gave himself up. Both these
facts told in the prisoner’s favor. Yet the Crown
apparently did its best to suppress them, and
prisoner’s counsel had to drag them out by cross-
examination. Possibly if the prisoner had had at
his command the services of a detective force pro-
vided for the prosecution, a lot more facts might
have been dragged out. Justice will always be
tainted, or, what is just as bad, liable to sus-
picion, so long as there is efficient machinery
provided to dig out the facts againt* ISM
prisoner only. For it must be remembered that,
if on any occasion the police can’t find the right
man, it is to their interest to hang the wrong one.
The practical test of an efficient police officer is
that he convicts the man who did the crime, or
convicts a man, and the public believe he is the
man who did the crime. The police get as much
credit and promotion for hanging the wrong man
as the right one so long as the public believes the
wrong man is the right one. The second case was
a pitiable one. The prisoner, a girl of no great
intellect, had been “betrayed” in the old con-
ventional sense, and had a baby. She was out on
the streets, a homeless waif, with her baby
and fid. She couldn’t get work ; she applied
at the charitable institutions of the Women’s
Christian Association and the Women’s Chris-
tian Temperance Union, and these bodies said
they didn’t take women with babies. There
was no foundling-hospital available, for the
Christian people of Melbourne say that such a
thing would be wrong ; so in the end
the girl dropped her infant into the Yarra,
and its troubles were over. The Yarra was
the only place which Christian Melbourne
provided for it. The jury wanted to call it
manslaughter, but the charge was one of
murder, and the law doesn’t allow the 12
men to find that the accused committed a
minor crime unless the minor crime is men-
tioned in the indictment, so the jurymen, who
held that the girl of dubious intellect didn't commit
murder, but only manslaughter, deliberately found
a verdict that she did commit murder, and the
sentence was accordingly. The third accused had
inflicted a slight wound on a woman with a knife.
It was alleged, with strong apparent reason, that
he meant to kill her ; but, anyhow, he did very
little damage. He didn’t injure his victim one-
tenth so much as did those three ruffians who
lately broke into a complete stranger’s
house in a Melbourne suburb, and pounded
him and his aged wife nearly to death,
and who were fined £5 and £1 respectively.
There was no more real evidence that he
meant murder than that they did —or rather there
was equally good evidence that none of them cared
whether they committed murder or not. But
in one case a policeman started the case with a
charge of “ intent to murder,” and in the other
some frightful “cop,” or other authority, started
the case with a charge of assault, so the man who
committed a scratch on one person is sentenced to
be hanged, and the gang of ruffians who battered
two people into insensibility and left them appar-
ently dead were fined, two of them £5 and the
other twenty shillings.
N.S.W. Art Intrigues.
The perennial N.S.W. Art conflict—Art Society
versus Society of Artists —is approaching an inte-
resting phase. The Art Society, while gaining
ground with the gain of representation on the Art
Gallery Trust, lost ground through the manner in
which it accepted the trust. It formally resolved
that its representatives might sell pictures to the
Gallery of which they are trustees —though this
trustee-sale has been the occasion of its bitter
opposition to Mr. Jultan Ashton, founder of the
Society of Artists. Yet the Art Society was per-
fectly innocent in intention, and merely erred for
want of common-sense. Trustee Ashton having,
it is alleged, said he would not sell pic-
tures to his Trust, did sell them; latterly,
the Trust has contented itself with buying
more or less dubious pictures by members
of the Ashton coterie. The Art Society
would never countenance the sale of pictures to
the Trust by Trustees Lister and Collingridge.
It was perfectly convinced that they would never
attempt to sell pictures. And, in order to show
its confidence in Messrs. Lister and Colling-
ridge, it refused to hamper them in any way—it
left the matter to their honor. And then the Art
Society muddled matters. Instead of maintaining
its negative, do-nothing attitude, it assumed a
positive permissive attitude, and formally resolved
that Messrs. Lister and Collingridge might sell
pictures if they chose. The Art Society’s resolu-
tion, in effect, says precisely what the Art Society
does not mean and will not permit—all for want
of a little common-sense. Now opens the second
act in the current drama, stage-managed by Mr.
Julian Ashton’s friend the Daily Telegraph.
Year by year Mr. Julian Ashton has
assailed in the Daily Telegraph the results of
the art classes at Sydney Technical College—and
with justice. Mr." Julian Ashton resigns his
seat on the Art Gallery Trust—as per Daily
Telegraph. An inspired friend (as it seems) of
Mr. Ashton spends more than a column of space
in the Daily Telegraph to prove that the time
has come to abolish the Technical College classes,
and to establish public Art Classes under the Art
Gallery Trust. The public mind is being pre-
pared, it appears. And it is alleged that it is
under contemplation by the official wire-pullers to
offer Mr. Ashton the post of director of such
classes at a salary of, say, £6OO a year. And the
little local art world waits developments. In all
these matters The Bulletin’s sympathy is
very largely with Mr. Julian Ashton.
This paper considers that Mr. Ashton’s
energy and enthusiasm have helped greatly in the
local development of art; and on the whole Mr.
Ashton has been very poorly rewarded for his
efforts. Without approving his conduct in de-
tails, The Bulletin considers that, broadly speak-
ing, the local artistic community is heavily in-
debted to Mr. Ashton. From one point of view his
preferment to a well-paid directorship of public
Art Classes, if it is offered to him, is thoroughly
well deserved. But from another point of view
The Bulletin regards such an appointment with
distrust. It dislikes the underground engineering
with which the Art Gallery Trust has been asso-
ciated. It considers that, whatever an individual’s
claims, the profit of the community comes first.
And it is not sure that, considering the hostility
with which Mr. Ashton is rightly or wrongly re-
garded by a prominent section of the local artistic
world, his appointment to the post suggested for
him would subserve the pi-ofit of the community.
That leaves out of the question Mr. Ashton’s
artistic qualifications for the position, as compared
with those of other local artists, or with those of a
stranger with more recent experience in European
centres of art. On the whole, therefore, The
Bulletin suggests that if the appointment be
offered to Mr. Ashton, it be offered for a short
term, continuance to depend on conduct. From
one point of view, Mr. Ashton might justly ob-
ject to such a compromise. From another point
of view, Mr. Ashton has earned it.

The law is wonderfully uncertain in its dealings.
Sometimes when a case comes before it in which
an ignorant person has been beguiled into making
a ruinous financial bargain, it holds that every
man is responsible for whatever bargain he makes,
and must stand by it. At other times it doesn’t.
In Sydney, recently. Judge A. H. Simpson dealt
with a case wherein a sane adult had sold for
£lO9O a reversionary interest which the buyer
resold for £3lOO. Mr. Simpson sensibly de-
cided that “it was a hard, unconscionable
bargain, obtained by taking advantage of the
plaintiff’s necessities,” and ordered that the
buyer must hand over the difference between
the amount he gave for the interest and the
amount he got for it when it was re-sold, less kz.
penses incurred. If the law can do this in certain
cases, why can’t it be done in all cases ? When 4
money-lender drives a “hard, unconscionable bar
gain ” and takes advantage of a borrower’s neces
sities to obtain an outrageous rate of interest, th#
law should have power to annul the bargain iij
every case. That would naturally involve the
recognition of a legal maximum interest-rate,
and such a rate is about the most urgently
wanted thing in Australia. And in addition
to this it should be enacted, as was recently
done in Germany, that the law shall have
power to grant relief in any case wherein one man
has driven a hard bargain under advantage of
another's needs or ignorance. Judge Simpson’s
decision holds that the law can do it when it feels
so inclined, but the process is spasmodic and
uncertain. What is required is an enactment
providing that the law shall always feel so inclined.
An “Act. to Make all Judges like A. H.
Simpson ” is what the case calls for.

The W. A. anti-Federal papers now begin to point
out that there is really no difficulty in the way
of Westralia being an original state of the Com-
monwealth except the very small question about it
being allowed to retain its border tariff in full for
five years, instead of the tariff being removed by
instalments. The proposal that the Federal
Parliament should complete Fremantle harbor is
never heard of nowadays, and as regards the pro-
posed transcontinental railway the Parochial organs
are falling over each other in their anxiety to
declare that all difficulties have been removed
since the S.A. Government has given its promise
to lend every possible assistance in the work.
Apparently the Goldfields Separation movement
is accountable for a good deal of this. A year or
18 months ago, Bigjohn could almost certainly
have got these terms for the asking; the extra
tariff concession is a mere trifle, and the S.A.
Government made proposals for carrying the
Brisbane-Adelaide line on to the W. A border long
ago and wasn’t listened to. But the ’Groper
Government was in an inflated condition
in those days. Only about three months ago
Big John’s proposed new Bill, with the tariff
scheme and the transcontinental railway both in
it, was submitted to the W. A. Upper House, and
that august body kicked it out with both feet, and
there was a general tendency on the part of the
Tory press to say it did well. At that time even
tho proposal that the great railway scheme should
be embedded in the Constitution was held to be
barely sufficient, and it was spoken of as a matter
of doubt whether so great a place as W.A. should
join the Commonwealth on any terms. Now it is
stated that Parker, Q.C., has been rushed off to
England to try and fix things so that Westralia
can get in with some shred of the Bigjohn
Government’s dignity left, as an original State, and
apparently-inspired organs allege that Westralia
really wants less than the terms which its Leg.
Council refused to consider three months ago. If
Westralia does get in as an original State it will
be a matter for congratulation, for a really-united
Australia is the one great end of the Federal
movement, and however strange the series of
wobbles by which the result is arrived at it will be
none the less fortunate. Yet, all the same, the
ways of W.A. politicians are very strange.

A general election is in prospect in Tasmania,
and Launceston Examiner appeals to the public
in an impassioned leading article full of blood and
beer to remember that the first essential is to elect
men who Fully Approve of the War. If the choice
lies between a man who knows how to make Tas-
mania prosperous and progressive and happy and
a lout who knows nothing at all, still the latter
should be preferred if he approves of the war and
the other man doesn’t, or if he approves more
vigorously than the other man. If Tasmania
would only sit down in a cool place and realise
that it doesn’t matter to the Empire one grain of
dust whether it approves of the war or not, it
surely wouldn’t go on like this. If Tasmania’s
approval was of some value then there might be a
show of reason for all this excitement, but if
that province filled its Parliament with the
worst kind of disloyalists, the Empire would
only have a vague idea that a fly had gone
past in its sleep. What the island badly wants is
to elect men who will squelch the ruinous Great
Western Railway syndicate scheme, who will open
up the west with state railways, who will shut
down on the disastrous loan policy, and build
some more good roads, and reform the Upper
House, and establish a policy of compulsory re-
sumption of big estates for closer settlement, and
clean the smellful city of Hobart, and do some-
thing in the way of a Factories Act, an improved
education system, a State Land Bank, and other
urgent reforms. The war will be ancient his-
tory by the time the next Tasmanian Parliament
meets, for its meeting is a long way off yet; and
whether members approve of it, or of the Cru-
sades, or of the destruction of Sodom and Gomor-
rah, will then be equally unimportant. In any case
what is the good of electing men who approve of the
then dead-and-gone Transvaal war, if no care is
taken to make sure that these men also approve of
the equally dead-and-gone Crimean war, or of the
capture of Seringapatam ? If Tasmania wants to
be solid in its loyalty, what it really needs is to
elect men who will promise faithfully to approve
of the next war—whatever it may be. To approve
of the war that ended a ...month ago is of no more'
practical use than to approve of the one that ended
800 years back.
In the case of Jones, found guilty of a most
brutal crime—the murder of a little girl at Broad-
ford (Vic.) —it is a solemn fact that there was no
direct evidence against him, the nearest approach
to it being that of a woman who, on the day of
the murdoi - , saw a man near the copper boiler
where the body was burnt. This woman had
never seen Jones before, and the window out of
which she was looking was 200 yards from the
boiler, yet she unhesitatingly identified the
accused. The jurymen went to Broadford to ascer-
tain if it was possible for anyone to recognise a
man near the boiler from the place where the wit-
ness was standing. They satisfied themselves that
a man could be seen, but not recognised, at that
distance, which seemed most disastrous to the evi-
dence ; and then returned a verdict of guilty, with-
outawordof advice orcensure from Jedge Hodges.
And the question now is—what on earth did these
jurymen get that cheap trip to Broadford for?
They ostensibly went there to find out if the chief
witness against Jones was reliable, therefore it
certainly appeared that they held that Jones’s
guilt or innocence hinged on her reliability. They
decided that her evidence against Jones wasn’t
reliable—and they found him guilty all the same.
If they were going to find him guilty whether
this evidence was reliable or not, why did they
want to go all that way to test its reliability ?

“Defender of the Faith," a new Sydney
Lyceum drama, by Charles Darrell, the London
Sleeper, ought to shake up the dry bones of
religious controversy a good deal before it is
finished. That is to say, unless the keepe sof
these bones have sufficient sense to remark that
the “Defender” is only an ill-jointed and foolish
fliici ncketty affair that isn’t worth argument.
Charles Darrell as a writer of historical drama is
hardly a serious subject. His pale heroine who
sings “Abide with Me” while crucified in a
lunatic asylum m the days of Mary I. looks very
beautiful—she is dressed in something like a white
night-dress, and the lime-light is on her, and her
hands are bound to a cross where she is going to
be left all night in order to restore her alleged
mental balance ; but, all the same, the writer has
doubts whether that hymn existed then. Also,
when the hero is to be beheaded at curfew and the
big bell won’t ring because a faithful gill is hang-
ing on to it and crying “ curfew shall not ring to-
mght, ’ it is an atrocious digging-up of a chestnut
that deserves to be left in its grave. Further, the
Roman Catholic bishop who has a son appears a
dubious item ; R.C. bishops doubtless had sons,
but they seldom mentioned the fact publicly, or if
they did they shouldn’t have.
* • • *
What story there is relates to the days
when everybody was so anxious to save his neigh-
bor's soul that he didn’t mind how much lie hurt
him if he could only make him recant, and thereby
avoid that Bottomless Pit on which the public was
then much more solid than it is now. People were
m desperate earnest about saving each other’s
souls at that period. But apart from the frying
of the heretic, Darrell has written a most ordinary
screamodrama. His hero is the bishop’s son, a
Protestant conspirator, who is engaged to the
bishops ward, and his wicked baronet wants to
marry the ward himself, as wicked baronets
always do. But being a mighty hunter after here-
tics, he doesn’t undermine his enemies with a
forged will, as the modem baronet does, but has
them fried. It is his one striking originality. He
demands that the girl shall marry lum, and in re-
turn he promises not to have her lover arrested
and fried. He drives her to become engaged to
him to save her guardian, the aged bishop, from
being done a nice brown in his old age. When
she revolts and breaks the engagement he fries the
venerable bishop. A gipsy girl whom he seduced
m her happy days of childhood insists on turning
up, and when at last she turns up once too
often he fries her. He proposes to fry their
joint and several illegitimate son, but the gipsy
mother kills him. He fries the doctor who refuses
to aid his nefarious schemes—in fact he is in a fair
way to fry the whole globe. The strongest scene
is where the baronet’s young son—who has heart-
disease—turns up at Smithfield, and the gipsy
woman calls out to him the horrible tale of his
father’s persistent frying, and he falls down dead
with horror. The baronet never smiles again.
He puts his intended wife into a lunatic asylum
where she finds her mother, who has been chained
in a dark cell for 15 years, and is also being fried
more or less. His hair turns white rapidlv. He
becomes a world-weary old wreck, and in the last
act lie is just about to fry and rack and behead
everyliody when he falls down dead. Then the
people who weren’t fried live happily for the rest
of tiieir days.

The “Defender” borrows a certain pic-
turesqueness from the clothes of 350 years ago,
and the dungeons, and the block, and the stake,
and the halberds, and the peculiar methods of the
bygone lunatic asylum, where violent cases were
treated with flogging, and chronic ones were
chained in dark cells and prodded with red-hot
irons to make them jump, and new patients on
probation, especially girls, were hung up by the
hands in the observation ward and called bad
names by the resident physician. Evidently sus-
pension then was the same thing that diagnosis is
now. Miss Dora Winton’s beautiful ruffs, and the
sweet voice with which she sings hymns when she
is hung up by the hands in the asylum, and her
finished acting, do a lot to disguise the fact that
her part is that of the most ordinary kind of
persecuted heroine. John Saunders’s rather
commonplace escapes out of prison and his
constant tendency to be beheaded are also re-
deemed by expensive red and green clothing,
though he shows him oif all through the sterling
actor he has always been. Sweeney is the chronic
Irish informer Englished and shifted back 350
years. Cathcart makes a fine, old bishop, but the
bishop has really nothing to do except be a re-
signed old man who is eventually burnt. Two
clever and natural little girls, Misses Beatrice
Holloway and Lilian Wiseman, are perhaps the
most interesting characters in this ordinary show,
and a somewhat unclothed person, simply de-
scribed as “an inmate,” who is being Hogged
with unusual energy when the curtain goes up on
the asylum-scene, also attracts the eye in a casual
sort of way. It is a finely-staged production, too,
but it has no very coherent story to tell, except
that the inquisitor then was just as cocksure and
as bigoted as the loyalist is now, and treated the
heretic very much as the present-day loyalist
wants to treat the person he suspects of not
approving of the war, and the inquisitor and the
loyalist were just equally frantic about the sinful-
ness of freedom of thought.

Bliss Nance O’Neil, from America, is due
at Sydney Royal on Saturday with “ Magda ” and
a new company, therefore Trilby, who made a
Bohemian livelihood in the Altogether, and Little
Billce, and Taffy, and the Laird, and the greasy
mane of that deceiver who made music for ze pig-
dog win only stay until 11 p.m. to-morrow (Fri-
day) night. The latest “Trilby” revival hasn’t
been quite the success it deserved. A number of
people have come and expressed cordial approval,
but a much larger number have stayed away.
Also people who, on her first visit, used only to
talk about Trilby’s feet, now seem to say a good
deal about her Past, and the wickedness of her
earning an honest crust in the Altogether. The
Altogether seems to have struck Sydney harder
than usual this time.

Grand old “ Henry V.” is to run another
week anyhow at Her Majesty’s. After that time
there are rumours that the present Royal company
will move down there (being ejected from its own
premises to make room for Miss O’Neil and
“Magda”), and play a drama about the weary,
weary Boer war, and talk about the tired and
miserable kopje, and the kloof, and the spruit, and
similar tilings dusty and accursed. The present
writer wishes the company no harm, but if the
report is true he trusts that arrangements may be
made for the manuscript of the new drama being
struck by lightning or plague or something. In
Australia nowadays people cry out about kopjes
in their sleep, and the subject badly wants a rest.

Brough’s forthcoming Australian season is to be

this mean the want of an opening or has Robert
discovered that the best way to create a strong de-

that very desirable comedian ?

The Tivoli co. is still going strong at
Sydney Criterion. Just now Miss Rochester,
Miss Carr-Glynn, Howard Chambers, and Miss
Francie Adler discourse some rather nice singing.
Howard Chambers booms about the far-off time
when the Dutch Admiral Van Tromp hoisted a
broom at the masthead as an intimation that lie
had swept the seas. Phil Goer whistles reason-
ably well, and in response to a third encore on
Saturday night whistled a new tune called
“Soldiers of the Queen.” It has a good swing
and if Phil whistles it some more will probably
become popular.

At Melb. Princess’s the story of the
damsel who continues to wear white socks and
imitation bare legs after she has reached the age
of mashing is a pretty big success thusfar.
“Little Red Riding Hood” can give points to
last year’s panto, at the same house—the awful
panto, in which Hoolev was the central joke—and
the mere fact of something previous having been
much less impressive goes a long way towards
giving the present spectacle a payable reputation.
All the same Melbourne remarks with a sigh that
the principals at the Princess's seem to lack the
means of shaking an audience up. The men’s
voices are weak, especially in contrast with the
explosive warble of the short-socked damsel, and
clever Miss Carrie Moore’s youthful figure is some-
what dwarfed by the well-grown chorus-ladies who
profess to be huntsmen in attendance. Also Carrie’s
bright young phiz, is put into the shade at the out-
set by a vast hat with gigantic white hearse-
plumes nodding from the crown. No individual
performer—except, perhaps, the donkey—is an
item of vital importance to the show, and if every
part were played by an understudy at a short
notice the difference in the general effect would
not matter much. “Little Red Riding Hood”
travels mainly on its scenery, chorus, army of
supers and ballet. The fast and furious gambol
m the first act is generally preferred to the slow
and stately minuet at the finish, but the girls are
a credit to this hemisphere in both cases. The
same remark applies to the female Scottish Brigade
and the N.S.W. Lancers, and all the other full-
grown daughters of the Empire. It is an absur-
dity for Australia to be sending Bushmen Contin-
gents to South Africa when J. C. Williamson’s
troops might reduce Oom Paul and all his burghers
to a state of delightful subjection by winking at
em in detail.
Widow O’Brien had a packed house at the
Royal on the second Saturday of her p ‘sent re-
vival, from which it would appear that the
perennial Bridget is likely to flourish ui. 1 further
notice. Some of Bridget’s conduct in ■ e bosom
of her family is more demonstrative and less
human than it used to be, but as long a the mul-
titude roars at these new extravag ices The
Bulletin doesn’t object. The V.ldy has
taken out a license to do as sh likes in
u T, OWn house, anyhow. When “Fun on
the Bristol ” gets down to the name-part of the
snow it is rather trying in places. One or two of
the variety turns leave a dull pain behind them,

only endurable for the sake of the little sermons

At Melbourne Alexandra the final defeat
of the enemy by the gallant Saint Kilda Roadsters
( Darn pier’s Own ”) happens to-night, after which
Briton and Boer” will be laid aside for altera-
tions and repairs. It was a sufficiently up-to-date
shocker three weeks ago, but the fortune of war
has deprived black Cronje of his traditional use-
fulness, likewise the stuffing has gone out of Kru-
ger's resolve to carry Kimberley by assault, and
many other topical allusions lag superfluous in the
narrative. “Briton and Boer” is probably the
first instance on record of a drama lasting through
five acts with a sanded floor. The scene changes,
but the same old sand holds the stage all the time,
and a force of about 30,000 local fleas are
said to be lying concealed amidst the grit. To-
morrow night (Friday) Dam pier will undertake a
“reverential production” of Shakespeare’s im-
mortal money-lender, and will sharpen his trusty
knife upon his vengeful boot what time Miss
Lily Portia is preparing to rob him of his pound
of flesh on a point of law. The lapse into Shake-
speare will be restricted to once a week. On
Saturday a reverential revival of “ His Natural
Life ” is to take {dace. In these days of hungry
garrisons and boiled horse-flesh there should be a
large demand for the gory fe:yst of Gabbett, and
it wouldn’t be a bad idea to couvert the Moocher
into a Boer prisoner.

Things at the Bijou are much the same as
usual, and the epidemic of War-concerts at the
Town Hall rages with unabated fury. The most
humorous side-show in Melbourne just now is an
Empire Exhibition of alleged “Boyne, Culloden

ranging from Joubert’s pipe to a boomerang. This
happens in the vestibule of the old Opera House,
and its whereabouts is proclaimed by a vehement

Cabled that George Musgrove will return
to Melbourne at the end of the year to stage a
Princess’s pantomime with Our Nellie as principal
boy. Which probably means that Nellie is
anxious to see her people, and “ knock ’ her Aus-
tralian public once again before she starts to be
quite English, you know. Also, it may mean
that Musgrove has finally decided to run the
Princess’s himself until he can get quit of his
half-share in the property, and shake the dust of
this country from his patent leathers. Anyway,
it would seem that Neilie Stewart has got a
release from her engagement with the Drury
Lane management, which was said to extend to
next Xmas panto.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The revenue returns for February, 1900, so far
as available, are as follows :
Revenue for Increase as
February, compared
1900. with Feb.,
1899.
New South Wales .. £542,267 .. £193,998
Westralia .. .. 240,119 .. 37,035
Queensland .. .. 278,601 .. 14,166
Tasmania .. 80,629 .. 3,004
Decrease as
compared
with Feb.,
1899.
Victoria .. .. 600,123 .. £5,810
So far as the present financial year has gone, or so far as
the accounts are available (two months of the financial
year have expired in Tasmania, and eight months in all
the other provinces, though in S.A. only six months’
accounts are published) the figures are as follows :
Increase as eom-
Revenue to Feb. pared with
28, 1900. corresponding
period of 1899.
N.S.W. (8 months).. £0,432,811 £403,682
Queensland ( „ ).. 3,043,548 331,998
Westralia ( „ ).. 1,837,209 237,908
Victoria ( „ ).. 4,761,741- 64,832
S.A. (0 months).. 1,257.654 44,899
Tasmania (2 months).. 172,684 1 3,879
If these are reduced to a common basis to show
how much the increase is per inhabitant per annum, the
results are about as follows :
Increase per inhabitant
per annum.
Westralia.. .. .. £2 2 5
Queensland .. .. 10 2
Tasmania .. .. 0 9 5
New South Wales.. .. 0 9 0
South Australia .. .. 0 4 10
Victoria .. .. .. 0 16
The amazing jump in the N.S.W. revenue is the
most notable feature of this month’s returns. Of the
£193,998 increase £140,083 is due to the fact that the
land-tax has been collected in February this year, where-
as in ’99 it was gathered in about March or April. Up to
the end of February the N.S.W. revenue was £6,432,811
and the expenditure £6,613,124, so there is still a deficit
of £180,313 to be overtaken. And the loan expenditure
of the eight months is £1,518,233, which is £207,012 more
than Reid spent for the corresponding period of last
financial year. If this rate keeps up N.S.W will get
through £2,277,350 of loan moneys by 39th June, 1900,
and this will be the most extravagant year in the way of
blewing other people's money since 1892.
Queensland’s expenditure for the eight months
to 28th February, 1990, is £2,605,279, so income is thus
far £438,269 ahead of outgoings. Queensland has spent
£736,304 of loan moneys during the eight months, which
is £31,350 more than the province got through up to the
corresponding dale of '99. The cheerful tendency on the
part of the loan expenditure to get a little bigger every
time is very marked. If Queensland keeps on at this rate
it will get through £1,104,456 of borrowed cash in the
year, which will be equal to over £2 ss. per inhabitant per
annum. Queensland is having something of a boom just
now, and almost every Australian boom when investigated
proves to have a large and gorgeous expenditure of loan
money at the bottom of it.
Westralia started the financial year with an
accumulated deficit of £247,349. At the end of January
it had been reduced to about £45,000, and with anything
like reasonable luck the end of March should see it
extinguished altogether.

Lambton (N.S.W.) municipality got another
unsavoury advt. in the law-courts, the other day. Years
ago Lambton floated a big loan from the Commercial
Bank of Australia for lighting purposes, and it paid
neither principal nor interest thereon. Also it meanly
tried to crawl out of both, on the ground that the
loan was technically illegal ; in other words, it claimed
that it ought to keep the money for good because it had
come by it wrongfully. It failed on this point and the
bank put in a receiver to collect the rate levied for the
service of the loan. The Council got over the difficulty
by not striking any rate to cover its loan liability. Then
the bank got an order of the court that a rate must be
struck, and the Council got out of that difficulty by re-
signing on such a large scale that there was no legal
quorum left to transact business. Also every eligible
male in the municipality refused to stand for the
position of alderman. Then, as a last resource,
the Governor appointed aldermen, and the new Coun-
cil met and also refused to levy any rate to cover
the liability to the bank. This was the last straw
on the back of an infuriated hanking institution
which couldn’t get its money, and the aldermen were
haled before the seat of justice and fined £lO each.
Lambton was true to its traditions to the last. The
aldermen didn’t pay the fines. The inhabitants raised a
subscription for the purpose, but didn’t pay them, either
—the money, for some reason or other, was left in the
hands of somebody or other, and the fines remained un-
paid. But when, the other day, the aldermen were
removed to prison for contempt tlie town expressed great
sympathy, and was deeply indignant. The insolence of
any bank wanting its money back simply filled Lambton
with wrath, and its great soql was torn with sympathy for
the aldermen who had (lone what the town wanted them
to do, and whom the town had promptly left in the lurch
when they did it.

The Victoria Insurance Co. made a profit of
£lO,Oll for the half-year ended 31st December, but in
view of various facts and circumstances it was decided not
to pay an interim dividend but wait the course of events
when the co.’s financial year ends in 30/6/’OO. This looks
as if the long-delayed wisdom which came on the 00. six
months ago was going to be maintained. In the last
seven years the Victoria Insurance Co. paid away £45
more than its earnings, largely in keeping up 35 and 44
per cent, dividends, and it did this though the manage-
ment knew and admitted that there was heavy deprecia-
tion to he provided for. When it was at last provided for
it reduced the reserves from £BO,OOO to £36,000. If the
management now intends to go slow and rebuild its lost
reserves it has struck a bright idea at last.

The New Zealand Accident Insurance Co. had
another good year in 1899. The profits and dividends for
the last nine years have been :
1891 .. £2349 .. 12£ per cent. = £625
1892 .. 1598 .. „ =625
1893 .. 1637 .. „ =625
1894 .. 4563 .. „ = 625
1895 .. 4881 .. 15 per cent. = 750

1898 .. 8001 .. „ = 1000
1899 .. 5771 .. „ = 1000
£44,533 £7OOO
The New Zealand Accident Insurance Co. has a paid-up
capital of £10,090, so its profits were 108 per cent, in 1897,
80 per cent, in 1898, and 57 per cent, in 1899. These are
tremendous figures, and it is no wonder that the State
Life Insurance Department has thoughts of going into the
accident business, and bung it at rather lower rates than
this magnificent private monopoly charges. And, in
reality, the profits are twice as large as they look. The
shareholders only put up £5OOO in cash —the balance is
capitalised profit. On the money actually put up by the
shareholders the earnings were 216 per cent, in 1897;
160 per cent, in 1898, and 115 per cent, in 1899. And the
last three dividends have been really 20 per cent.
The co. has £1797 brought forward from
1898, which, added to the year’s profits, makes £7568
available for division. The 10 per cent, dividend
absorbs £lOOO ; another £5OOO is added to reinsurance
fund, and £IS6S carried forward. The N.Z. Acci-
dent Co. has now £lO,OOO paid-up capital and £33,568
of reserves (reserve fund, £20,000 ; reinsurance
fund £15,000, and profit balance, £1568). Its earnings
from interest alone (£2829) would enable it to pay 28 per
cent, on the nominal capital or 56 per cent, on the capital
actually paid up, even if it went out of the insurance
business altogether. During nine years it has paid £7OOO
in dividends, capitalised £5OOO of profits, added £31,000t0
reserves and £1533 to profit balance. As a profit-
making concern, it even lays over the wonderful Silverton
Tramway Co.—in fact, so far as the writer can recollect,
there is no other joint-stock concern like it in the Seven
Provinces.

The Perpetual Trustee Co. (Sydney) has struck
a wise idea in proposing that the directors shall have
power to forfeit the shares of dead shareholders unless
within 12 months they are transferred to the name of
some satisfactory live heir. A co. whose shares are fully
paid up doesn't need to care how dead its shareholders
are—if they were all quite defunct it would make no
difference. But a trustee co. with a very large uncalled
capital wants to know that its shares are held by people
who are good for calls if wanted —it must do so for the
protection of the people whose money it holds—and
corpses are insufficient security. Owing to the gradual
distribution of the estate even the richest corpse soon
gets down to beggary.

B.H. South has, for the moment, settled its diffi-
culties by reducing its directors from six to five, dropping
the director who was proud of having held office without
owning the necessary qualifying shares for nearly three
years, and appointing a managing-director at £5OO
a-vear. Also, in view of the fact that Block 14 Co., of
which Mr. T. J. Green way is manager, is a buyer of the
South co.’s products, that gentleman has ceased to he the
South co.’s consulting superintendent. If the other
directors did a fair amount of work for their fees, a
managing director would not he needed ; and then the
co. could afford to engage a first-class general manager.
The Barrier co’s that have been the least successful have
been just those which have frittered away coin on
managing-directors, and business-managers, and mine-
managers, and surface-managers, third-rate men every
one, instead of lumping two or three of the salaries and
engaging a first-rate manager of the Stewart or YVarren
pattern.

B.H. North, which has been worked for 12
years, just pays its second div. ; this tiim it is a nine-
penny. The co. produces an average of 2500 tons of lead
per half-year ; and. as lead has risen £5 a ton during the
last four or five years, the profit is mostly accounted for
in that way. Still, there have been other changes,
especially with regard to saving the silver in the sul-
phides. At one time 76 per cent, of the silver was lost in
eliminating the unsmeltable zinc (the trouble with all
silver sulphides is that the zinc and the silver are so inti-
mate); inside two years such an improvement has been
made in that respect that the recovery of silver has been
doubled. But. unfortunately, the ore in this mine, as in
most of the others, becomes more refractory the deeper
they sink ; so that the recovery of lead is not so good,
despite improved appliances.

Milburn Creek Copper, N.S.W. “ The
directors, whilst still holding a high opinion o F the mine,
have determined to pursue a more conservative policy
and recommend a co. of not more than £150,000 with a
working capital of £20,000.” If it were a N.S.YV. co. any-
thing on these lines would be considered a very pro-
gressive concern indeed, and shareholders would want to
know what was going to be done with so much money. It
is being handled, however, by men who have large in-
terests in copper elsewhere and who know that big money
is needed to work a copper mine. Before the end of this
year they should pretty well know what the Milburn
Creek is stuffed with.

Occasionally they got a splash only sufficient to encourage
them to spend more money ; whether the show will ever
be re-opened will largely depend upon the workings of
the YVentworth itself and as these have long been carried
on at a loss the prospect is not very encouraging.

Blayney Mining and Smelting Co. (N.S.W.).
A change to pyritic smelting has been completed in this
mine this week ; the result should be known in the
course of next. During the time taken to put in hot
blast stoves the railway-siding has been extend.d, a tram-
wav built, and other parts of the mine have been ex-
plored, notably the workings around Marks shaft which
are fully 100 ft. deeper than any from which ore has been
taken by the present co. As expected, the ore left in
these old workings is higher in grade than that above,
and it is from these that the bulk of the output will now
come. Altogether the owners have expended over
£39,000, and with resignation contemplate parting with
another £lO,OOO before they consider the mine properly
equipped. During the recent smelting stoppage the mam
shaft has been sunk upwards of 100 ft., and the whole of
the matte produced by the blast furnace has been turned
into copper, most of it on the mine by means of rever-
beratory furnaces, and the balance sent away to Lithgow
and Newcastle. Value of product to date, over £IO,OJO.

Cobar-Chesnev, N.S.W. The returns from the
first 90 tons concentrates treated at Cockle Creek are
more satisfactory than anticipated, giving a net result of
over £7 per ton, including £1 6s. 3d. for gold. The latter
is somewhat of a surprise to those who had been led to
believe that the gold-contents were so infinitesimal as
not to pay for extraction, although the men who handled
the property some two years ago satisfied themselves
beyond doubt that the ore contained from 2 to 3 d vt.
per ton, and this return goes far to prove that they were
right. It is easy to understand the non-finding of gold
when it occurs in small quantities in a low or high-grade
copper ore, hut it is impossible to imagine its being paid
for, as in this instance, if it had no existence. The
duplication of the present concentrating plant has already
been determined, and I’rovis, the new manager, is very
anxious to get the mine equipped to keep up a production
of 400 tons a day. If this is done, there can he no doubt
the mine can he made a div.-payer, always provided
copper keeps within a reasonable distance of present
price. The Chesney has an excellent asset in from 39.000
to 50,0 >0 gallons o'f water a day coming from the mine.
Provision has been made for water conservation, though
the dams would have to be enlarged to maintain the
contemplated output.

profitably lauohed ; if the promoters’ profit was not exor-
bitant ; if the mine had not been worked off and on for 15
years without profitable result (/.<?., the Briseis had spent
£199,000 to win £61,293); also, if the “ rig” (engineering
the colonial share market) was not for the purpose of put-

Mt. Lyell amalgamation. W. R. Wilson is said
to he the author of the proposal to amalgamate the Mt.
Lyell with several others in the vicinity. The South and
tlie North (tile latter a misnomer), the Tharsis, Crown
Lyell and one or two others. A magnificent idea if it can
he carried out, of which the writer is doubtful. The
parent mine holds the key of the situation, although it is
quite evident that the directors of the North Mt. Lyell in
London and in Australia think then do. If so, they never
made a greater mistake, and Heaven knows they have
made enough in the management of this concern. They
bought steamers and sold them when they found they
had no possible use for them. Nearly two years ago they
bought smelters which have never been used. The Aus-
tralian chairman, Mr. Lonergan, says he has no knowledge
of any scheme of amalgamation, and is emphatic that
there* is no likelihood of its being brought about.
“ The ore-bodies in the North Lyell are opening up
beyond expectation in quantity and quality. It is
proposed to erect an initial nest of five smelters at the
North Mt. Lyell similar in character to the latest addi-
tions to the Mt. Lyell plant.” “An initial nest of five
smelters” is very rich and another proof that the manage-
ment of the North Lyell suffers from swollen head. It has
no ore in sight to warrant any such undertaking, and if it
had the ore it has no smelting base, and the obtaining of
the necessary fluxes elsewhere is certainly not beyond
doubt. It has here and there large bunches of rem irk-
ahly high-grade ore, but it has no defined lode or deposit
anywhere. The workings in the mine itself have estab-
lished the fact that no dependence whatever can he
placed either on the strike or continuity of these bunches.
If they continued one or more of them would have been
found in the Crown Lyell which has been over two years
looking for them without success. Its only certain salva-
tion is amalgamation with Mt. Lyell which has one of the
finest pyritic smelting bases in the world containing
abundance of iron and sulphur (the North has neither),
lacking only in silica which the North and other mines
can supply.
Amalgamation at Mt. Lyell would probably
mean the carrying out of the original recommendation of
Dr. Peters—the construction of a tunnel from the smelting
plant to the mine—thus doing away with themountainous
haulage, prospecting the intersected country ill a manner
that is riot likely to be otherwise done, and thereby
increasing the water supply which cannot be too great.
Writer does not see why the great expenditure
involved in the building of the North Lyell railway
should stand in the way. Anyhow the Mt. Lyell, by
reason of its equipment and the character of its ore, has
an octopus grip on all the mines around it and it’s only a
matter of waiting and watching to demonstrate the fact.
It is amalgamation or liquidation for several mines on the
list.
* • » *
The Lady Shenton, a consistent div-payer for
some time, will be off the list for probably the rest of the
year. The mine is getting near the end of its rope, so far
as existing levels are concerned ; and instead of profits
that have been made lately going to the shareholders
they are to he spent in deepening the main shaft,
strengthening the hauling and other plant, and replacing
the boilers which the use of mineralised water has already
ruined.

The Westralian sensation for the week was the
simultaneous resignations of manager Callahan from Lake
View Consols and manager Irwin from the Associated
Mines. This coincidence is not altogether surprising to
people who know the two men. Writer is certain that if
one of them had to go the other would leave. Equally
sensational is the appointment of W. J. Collins to Lake
Mew ; the appointment of O’Gorman to the Associated
Mines is only now needed to liven things up. To keep up
a general public interest in things, the writer would sug-
gest that Callahan report on the works of his successor at
the YVentworth mine, and that Irwin should deal with
O’Gorman on the Cobar Gold Mines. Of Callahan be it
said that, whatever his faults, he pioneered all the big
work of Kalgoorlie gold-field. The moment he satisfied
himself beyond a doubt that the Lake View was a great
mine, he started to work it in a manner that opened the
eyes of the public, and gave a lesson to all other managers
on the field. YY’ith his excellently-arranged crushing-
plant he soon caught up to the total production
of the Great Boulder, which had nearly two years
start of him. He did more than any other manager in
overcoming the water difficulty of the field. He was the
first man to prove the efficiency of cyanide in the treat-
ment of the tailings ; also the first to introduce the filter-
press system of treating slimes, now universally acknow-
ledged'to be the best up to date. His opening the mine
has not been improved, though followed by others, and
when he did strike the richest chute of gold found on the
field, if not in the whole world, it did not take him long
to send ore away which realised over half a million of
money. His only mistake seems to have been in the con-
struction of the furnaces used in the sulphide plant. This
he has admitted, and he went a long way to remedy it by the
arrangements he made in England and on the Continent.
The S.M. Herald prints that it is understood
Mr. Irwin is in independent circumstances, and will leave
on a visit to Paris shortly. It is to be hoped this is true, for
hitherto Irwin has not been credited with making over-
much money for himself. Also, it is to be hoped manager
Callahan is also independent; for the chances are that
after what has happened to the mines both he and Irwin
would have had to leave them willy-nilly. The managers
of rich mines run by market operators of the Kauftnann
and Whitaker Wright order are generally made the vic-
tims of circumstances, and when those circumstances
arrive money is the best consolation the manager can
leave with.

In the Westralian Market and Mines the ex-
pected has not happened. The public has beeu told that
the great Western slump was all on account of the Trans-
vaal war, and that the British reverses in South Africa
had magnified it; the mines themselves were all right.
They are never wrong. The output in two or three in-
stances had greatly fallen off, but many reasons were
given for this. The shipping of sulphides had been
stopped. They were reserved for treatment by local
sulphide plants. The developments were better than
ever. All the deep levels were looking well, the rich
chutes were going down, and bores in the Great Boulder
had proved the extent and richness of lodes below 1000 ft.
All that was wanted was assured success of British arms
in South Africa and the market would boom. As has
been here persistently pointed out, this was all hog-
wash. The mines, though great, were not so great as t he
public had been led to believe ; the Transvaal war had
little to do with the slump—for if it had, Mt. Morgan,
Mt. Lyell, Broken Ifill, and other mines largely owned in
England as well as Australia (as are the Kalgoorlie mines)
would have been similarly affected. In fact, the Band
mines themselves have had no such slump as that which
began early in Nov. in the Westralian mines, and has
continued with slight variation ever since. It is now
quite plain that the public have been led to carry these
mines to values unwarranted by divs. or developments,
and what happened in the history of ev> "y individual
mine, such as Broken Hill, Mt. Lyell, Mt. U irgan, and a
dozen others that could he enumerated, has
only repeated itself in the group covered by
about a square utile on the Kalgoorlie field. The public
is now more or less wading in under the delusion that the
mines’ values have touched bottom, paying no attention
to the fact that the relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith
and the assured beginning of the end of the war has only
had the effect of sending them lower still. Writer would
point out that but for one circumstance they would have
reached even a lower depth. What was going to happen
was known to hundreds on the field an(l elsewhere, hut
in market mining knowledge is money, and the best
thing to do is to keep it as dark as the lungs of midnight.
They have acted on the knowledge. Speculation in Lon-
don and elsewhere is so conducted as to enable the know-
ing to sell what they haven’t got, and nearly every mine on
the field has been largely oversold. Three or four of them
have been oversold three or four times over ; in fact it is
said with some show of likelihood that one mine has been
sold six times over. Obligations have got to he met fort-
nightly. Weak men cannot carry over, strong men can ;
the latter, who sold Lake Views at £25 and Associateds at
£l2 10s., are still waiting to cover, being perfectly satis-
fied that they will go lower still. It is this over-selling
that has given fictitious values to some of the outsiders.
Imagine a mine like Chaffers’ having a market-value of
half-a-million, with six acres of ground in a good position,
hut never a dividend ! Nortli Kalgurlis still tit's. Why?
Nothing in the mine, hut greatly over-sold in London.
Brown Hill Extenders, a sngill chute of rich ore, the
limited extent of which is known, and so with half-a-dozen
others. Cornering is impossible—the scrip is too widely
distributed—hence the slump is not over yet.

against ex-owner Rogers and in favor of the Ro.val Bank,
whose authority to sell under mortgage was contested.
Of course Rogers may possibly appeal to the Privy
Council, but meanwhile sundry Croydon people are tear-
ing their hair. Under authority from Rogers the Bank
sold the mine for about £ll,OOO to Elmslie Ltd., who, after
they had found in it a new and reputedly rich lode,
floated it in London for £lOO,OOO or so.

The directors of the Hampden copper mines,
N.Q., have received a report from their mine manager,
Mr. F. Stanley Low, dated 11th Feb., stating that he has
now raised and stacked on the mine, near Cloncurr.v, 2020
tons of copper ore of the following grades, viz. : 210 tons
firsts, assaying 40 per cent. ; 1236 tons seconds, assaying
13 per cent. ; 570 tons thirds, assaying Gj- per cent., the
average assay being 14 per cent., and the total gross
copper value £21,500. About 20 men are employed upon
the mine. The ore is being taken out from two open
cuts, situated in the centre and southern portions of the
property. The directors of the company are Messrs.
William Orr (chairman), 11. 11. Schlapp, T. H. Orr, and
William Knox, M.L.C. Mr. R. E. Tweddell, 31 Queen-
street, Melb., is the legal manager. It will be remembered
that a good many months ago an attempt was made,
chiefly by persons holding blocks outside the Hampden
property, to boom the locality. Some shares in the
Hampden copper mines did change hands at sensational
prices, but a stop was put on the endeavor to sky-
rocket the show by Mr. Schlapp’s refusal to say much
about it until a lot more work had been done. If the ore
raised comes from a big and permanent formation the
lucky and plucky old crowd’s good fortune is still stick-
ing to it.

Chillagoe railway and mines—“ Mr. Alexander
Stewart has still every confidence in the ultimate success
of the properties.” Thus Sydney D.T. Well, it would be
remarkable if he hadn’t, seeing that the co. is facing an
expenditure of upwards of half-a-million of money. The
shages have firmed considerably during the last month,
hut the indefiniteness of the weekly reports from the
mine continues. The last two or three are remarkably
colorless! If they were from any other Australian copper
mine the outlook would he considered very black. On
the other hand, those front Mt. Garnet Freehold are re-
markable for clearness. Values are given for every foot
of ground sunk or driven on. Thus it is made evident that
the Mt. Garnet 00. has exposed tens of thousands of tons
of ore running from 5 to 10 per cent, copper, and from
10 to 20oz. silver per ton, warranting the work they are
doing in the erection of smelters. Jt is absolutely im-
possible to arrive at any such conclusion from reading the
reports of the Chjllagoe Railway and Mines Co. ; and the
public are placed on the horns of this dilemma : either it
is impossible to {rive any definite particulars of tonnage or
value—writer cannot understand why it should he—or
these properties are not what they were cracked up to be ;
and developments have shown what several mining men
suspected years ago—that the ore was in bunches and
pockets, and the character of its occurrence generally did
not warrant this huge undertaking.

Vic. Govt, has been further considering the
alleged desire of a certain “ English syndicate ” to build
90 miles of Mount Reddick railway at a cost of £300,000,
in return for large land concessions. There seems to be
quite as much difficulty as might have been expected in
bringing this Reddick scheme up to the scratch.
“ The proposals put before the Cabinet were considered to
he too general,” so a conference between Ministers and
syndicators was decided upon, and in due course
the completion of a “ draft agreement ” will be notified in
the Melb. press for the encouragement of public interest
in Reddick mining shares.

Last Wednesday Sydney emptied itself on
to the streets and balconies and over the parapets
and roofs to see the embarkation of the Bush
contingent for the Transvaal. It was a great
sight—the vast crowd, and the wildly reckless
way admiration-hungry damsels hung their feet
(in new hose and half-guinea shoes) over the
parapets. All along the line of route the volunteers
leaned on their rifles with an air of haughty in-
difference and kept the road clear for the men
who, The Bulletin sincerely hopes, will be too
late for serious killing when they reach South
Africa.
Distant strains of “Soldiers of the Queen,” a
burst of cheering, then a great rattling and an
army-service corps lorry goes clattering down the
lane of fixed bayonets. When it has clanged away
into silence the crowd resumes the discussion of
the Avar, and everywhere are rings of amateur-
strategists all talking at the same time. And they
Avr angle and snort till there comes a crash of music
and vocal thunder, and a shout of “ Here they
are ! ” A dark-skinned aboriginal rides in the van.
They kiss their hands with lordly condescension to
the hundreds and thousands of women who are ivav-
ing handkerchiefs and lisping farewells. One en-
thusiastic dame stretches out both arms and
exclaims passionately, “Boys, I’d like to kiss
you all—every one of yous !” And the crowd
laughs scornfully. As they rode by their yellow-
ish helmets showed clear against their tanned
faces which looked rocky enough to break shells
against—in fact their faces will be excellent cover
to fight behind. The Bushies will need no en-
trenchments.
There were only 500 odd of them, yet, though
they were in close order, it was wonderful what a
big croAvd they seemed. Some were smoking,
some waving miniature flags, one carrying a ring-
tailed ’possum, head-downwards, and another bore
THE FAMILIARITY THAT BREEDS CONTEMPT.
“But I thought the Smiths and Browns were inseparable friends?“
“Oh! they were ; but, you see, they've been next-door neighbors for these last three months! ”
on his arm the regimental dog, “Bushy,” gor-
geously decorated with streamers of red, white and
blue. “ Bushy” is an exceedingly small pup, and
what his breed is was impossible to see, for the
mass of silken ribbons that streamed from all oyer
him—even his tail seemed to be tied up in silk
ribbons. He had a twinkle in his eye, and his
tongue hung down nonchalantly as though he was
having a good time and was going to revel in it
comfortably.
Somewhere up Macquarie-street the crowd was
so thick that the Hielandmen and Cadets had to
turn back and make their way to the wharf
through the Domain. And the people were pour-
ing across the grass in thousands—in hurrying
squares, shambling straggly columns, rolling
towards the wharf like a flood down a mill race.
At the Domain gates another crowd that had
poured along with the Bushies was surging in to
f£ike up positions of observation along the heights
overlooking Woolloomooloo Bay. When the two
hordes met there was an awful struggle. Men’s
coats were torn, and women’s gathers wrecked by
the hundred. One woman was dragged through,
and left her skirt behind her. A sympathetic
volunteer went back into the mill and brought out
the fragment to her. Fortunately, she had on a
beautiful lace petticoat, and it was all right ; but
the possibilities were too horrible to be even
hinted at. . . Lots of women don’t wear nice lace
petticoats.
Down on Cowper’s Wharf someone had blun-
dered. Where the people rolled along before at
the other departures some thick-head had had
picket-barricades erected, and had not troubled to
take any steps to let the people know they
were marching into a cul-de-sac. When the van-
guard bumped against the picket fence it recoiled
and tried to come back, but the pressure of thou-
sands pushing in behind hurled it against the
obstacle, and women screamed and children
shrieked as the pressure became intolerable.
What would have happened Heaven only knows
had not some sensible policemen completed the
tearing-down of the pickets and let the people get
through.
The transports were a splendid object-lesson to
the swashbuckling incompetents who play at
organisation in this thirsty land. The horse-stalls
were a part of the ship herself, one and indivisible.
They were built about as close as a fireproof-safe,
and no horses’ tails could be seen hanging through
the cracks, as on the Surrey. But it was a lesson
thrown away. At 3 and 4 p.m. on Wednesday
huge lorries of compressed hay and other fodder
were driving through that seething, struggling,
close-packed mass of humanity. Only the Pro-
vidence that marks the dangers of drunks and
small babes prevented a Juggernaut sacrifice.
On the wharf itself things were somewhat better
managed. There the great bulk of the space was
kept for the troops and horses, and the men and
nags stood in line quietly awaiting their turn, till
someone shouted something, and a bugle screamed,
and all the Bushies lined up in hollow square be-
fore a raised platform covered with flags and fat
old ladies of both sexes. Standing three-deep, the
helmets of the Bushies looked like a serrated mass
of nice new clay ant-hills. The derrick-chains of
the Maplemore were creaking, a band was playm"
the ever-present melody, and between the flags
stood a bulky and imposing personage intoning
with a droning voice something about Freedom
and Order. When he had done a feu-defoie of
hand claps ran round the kharki lines and another
mass of black coat came forward between the
flags and drivelled at the soldiers. High over-
head, sublime, on the dizzy point of a step-ladder,
a camera-fiend trained his maxim-like machine on
the droning apparitions.
But the sight of the show was the Cow-Shaking
Ministry in carriages. P.M.G. Crick wore a
little round straw hat tilted- down OA’er his eye as
though he lived in mortal fear of an egg. They
all looked most undignified if not actually dis-
reputable, but Crick looked absolutely shocking,
Had he not been knoAvn the police would certainly
have kept an eye upon him as a Boer.

“ Societyhas had a large say in the
officering of the N.S.W. contingents. The Per-
manent Force consists of artillery, and the
artillery officers and their wives have had for
many years all the strings of social influence in
their hands. Therefore, it cannot be wondered
that in the struggle for the loaves and fishes the
artillery hangers-on have prevailed. As a matter
of fact, the preference unblush iugly given to
poorly-qualified artillery-officers over well-quali-
fied outsiders constitutes a blazing scandal, but
“the Barracks” must be served.

There were ructions in S.A. military
circles over the appointment of Hubbe, a common
civilian without military experience, to the
command of the local Bushmen’s contingent.
Hubbe, an inspector under S.A. Lands Depart-
ment, has been in the bush nearly all his life and
surveyed the stock route from Port Augusta to
Coolgardie. The military nominee for the position
was a heavily-moustachioed Major who has been
a clerk in the Govt, offices for the last 14 years.

The dodging and chicanery resorted to by
Vic. amateur soldiers ambitious for service in
Africa is incomprehensible. Everybody thought
to possess influence even in the most round-about
way is importuned in an intensely servile and abject
manner by the man who wants to be a hero. Said
one recently-appointed lieutenant, “ If I’d known
how a man has to degrade himself before he’s
allowed to fight for his country, I’d never have
volunteered.”
There are strange yarns about the new W.A.
contingent also. Apparently it has been made a
receptacle for the old and crippled horses of in-
fluential citizens ; and weird tales circulate about
persons in authority who have cast their aged
moke on the waters of patriotism, and it has
returned to them after many days, and after the
suffering country had paid for it. Also, narratives
go round insistently about how, when the authori-
ties had accepted a good horse for the contingent,
he Avould be mysteriously gone next morning and
an aged, toothless wreck would be standing in his
place and trying to look as like him as he could
without actual perjury. In the East, most of the
troubles arose through the dodges adopted to get
useless men into the contingents. In the West,
the row seems rather to have been over the intense
desire of many patriots to seize the opportunity
for trading off a useless horse.
Major J. Randal Carey’s
horse, unable to support so much
greatness since its rider began to
boss the N.S.W. Bush Contingent,
fell down the other day and
tumbled Major J. Randal Carey off.
The Bulletin is sincerely glad to
hear that Major J. Ran-
dal Carey escaped
comparatively unhurt.
A measure of
the bushmanship
of some of the
members of
N.S.VV. Bush-
men’s Contin-
gent can be
gained by
reading the
numerous ac-
counts of their
suburban “send-
offs.” The number
of bush men with addresses in Surry Hills and Mar-
rickville is frightful to contemplate. This paper
supposes it was the Surry Hills bushmen who
were reported as “knocked-up ” after their recent
two days’ ride, in which they covered not less than
30 miles.

A few orafors of even the high-cockalorum
Glorious Fourth order might be tolerated in
N.S.W. in view of the awful stodginess of the
speechifying over the recent Bushmen’s Contin-
gent send-off. Chunk from the deliverance of
good old Chief-Justice Acting-Governor Darley:
Soldiers, it may be that by the accident of war, or the
accident of sickness, some of you may never return to
us. I hope that such a thing may not happen ; I hope I
may see you all back again. Events may happen to the
contrary, but recollect this—those who do not return to
us their names will be emblazoned on the scroll of fame of
this colony. I may say here and now that I hope to see,
indeed I look forward to seeing, some memorial placed in
the city of Sydney on which may be recorded the names
of those who fall and those who do not return to us.
[Apparent inference that some of the dead will re-
turn.] Perchance some monolith may be erected on
which all the names of the men who have gone forth from
among us to do honor to their country, to fight for the
Empire, may be recorded. No greater honor than that
can be placed over any man’s tomb —[No greater honor
than what ?]—he fell for the honor of his country, he fell
in order to establish peace and order, and good govern-
ment, and freedom in this great Empire.
Slab from Premier Lyne :
You, I know, can sit firm and ride straight. The
colonies now have to sit firm [beautiful parallel !] as por-
tion of our Empire. Under these circumstances I feel
that we have nothing to fear, and that you will reflect
very great credit upon this colony [choice reporterese],
just as those who have gone before have reflected honor
upon us. You will come back to be received with gener-
ous hearts and open arms. Those who do not come back
will deserve and receive a memorial, such as the Lieuten-
ant-Governor spoke of just now.
Their troubles! —in that case ! Gem from the
eloquent War-Minister See:
I desire to emphasise the fact that you, bushmen-
soldiers, were, five weeks or less ago, carrying on your
various avocations in the country. (A truly remarkable
fact') When the call was made, you responded with a

magnificent work on Saturday, and your still more recent

The N.S.W. Bushmen’s Contingent is
officered to a not inconsiderable extent by the
same men who officered the special constables en-
listed to ride-down the recalcitrant workers at the
time of the great labor-strike; and the contin-
gent’s errand is to shove off the little selector who
has pegged-out a fertile corner just outside the
Imperial squatter’s run.
* * *
It is complained that two of the officers of
the N.S.W. Bush Contingent are “ city lawyers.”
Well! when they exclaim “ Charge !” the rest of
the regiment will yell “ Six-and-eightpence ! ” —or
more, as the case may be, and in five minutes
there won’t be a live Boer within a mile.
Item from a Maoriland contingenter’s
letter published in a Dunedin paper:
Everybody is looting a beautiful homestead. I have
secured some music, which I will send to Charlie. I got
over late, but managed to secure some clothes and
bankets. He (the owner) was very rich, and had a splen-
did piano and organ, which “ Tommy” played in his own
style. Things such as large clocks and bureaux were
smashed for fun. Beds were ripped open, books trampled
under foot, and mirrors and glassware were smashed.
Our own men were as bad as any. We had great fun
reading the girl’s letters, which were more or less interest-
ing. I will enclose some for your own perusal, then you
will be able to form an idea. Some of the chaps often say
they wish they were in the “Zetland” worrying a pint
and some pickled onions. There is nothing to drink out
here; we get a smell of some rum occasionally, but it
would take four men’s allowance to make a nip. . .
Every man says this is the last trip he will come for. I
suppose they expected feather-beds and dining-saloons.
It is grand fun to sit in the tent and listen to the boys
saying, “Why did I leave my little back room ? ” Per-
haps I am as sorry as anyone, but I will take care that
everyone will not know.
After this and many similar letters—especially
that revolting horror contained m the letter ot
the N.S.W. trooper published in a Maitland paper
about the Australians who stuck biscuits m the
mouths of the dead Boers and mutilated their
bodies —isn’t it about time that (for policy s, apart
from shame’s sake) the Australian press gave up
holding forth about “ Boer brutality . If the
stories some of the contingenters tell about them-
selves and their comrades are true, we need no
lessons in savagery.

Has the sense of humor—often synonym-
ous with the sense of the fitness of things entirely
deserted Australia ? Sydney Philharmonic Society
last week gave a performance in aid of the war-
fund, and rendered “The Messiah” to a large
audience. So, even Christ —the Man of Peace
and Goodwill—is exploited for the purpose of sub-
sidising an ensanguined freebooting expedition.
To heighten the effect—“ The best work of the
chorus” (it is printed) “ was done in three linked
numbers— ‘Surely,’ ‘And with His stripes,’ and
‘ All we like sheep.’ ” Also, “ The pathos in ‘He
was Despised ’ was warmly recognised.” He was
Despised. Can the public see a joke nowadays ?

A well-known Cairns paper recommended
the shooting of any individual avowing pro-Boer
sentiments,
the editor
candidly avow-
ing that he
would be glad
to form one of
the shooting-
party. A few
weeks afterwards,
two Towers men
had a war-argu-
ment and the Jingo
disputant pulled out
a revolver and pumped
four bullets into his
adversary, killing him.
Question : Had he read
that article ?
The junior Bar is
also handicapped in
India. At Bombay, re-
cently, a barrister-at-law
conducted a criminal case
in consideration of being
paid the magnificent fee of two
rupees and eight annas, and a
half-share in the milk of a she-
goat for a period of two weeks.
Which recalls that the fee of
a well-known Sydney water-police
court advocate, on a certain memorable
occasion, long ago, consisted of a pair of ducks,
which his lady-client brought into court under her
shawl. She actually took them with her into
the witness-box (where they quacked loudly),
being far too cautious to hand them over to her
legal adviser until he had “seen her through.”

In Adelaide patriotic mothers have been
selling their babies on the “Bugler principle ” for
the benefit of various patriotic funds. The babies
fetch good prices, but are never delivered over to
the purchaser. Sydney and Melbourne ought to
go one better, and hold genuine sales. The adop-
tion of this principle would enable a great many
people to display their patriotism by—supplying
the babies.

In their selection of officers the bosses of
the S. Australian Bushrangers’ Corps have, at any
rate, rejected everyone who wasn’t strictly a bush-
man. Hubbe, the captain, has been doing the
Govt.’s “bushiest” work for years—sometimes as
chief of the wild-dog scalpers, at others in charge
of parties opening-up stock routes, and latterly as
inspector of pastoral improvements. And of the
others Collins is an overseer on one of the stations
of his uncle, J. H. Angas; and Ives is himself a
working squatter of the extreme out-back.
Whereat, of course, the military clique has raised
an ear-splitting howl.

Stated that Colonel Onslow threw up his
billet as second-in-command of N.S.W. Bushmen
as a protest against the apparently scandalous
treatment meted out to his friend, Capt. Larkin.
Otherwise he would have much preferred going
with the Bushmen to joining Tucker’s staff. It
is by the way, only fair to again inquire when the
military authorities intend to explain why they
publicly broke faith with an admittedly capable
soldier like Larkin in favor of a young man with
little or no military training ? Is it because the
said young man happens to be the son-in-law of a
staff-colonel ?

The magnificent send-off and overwhelming cordiality

In imitation of N.S.W. Minister Perry,
Bananaland Govt, has issued a notice to all
teachers informing them that if they will only
specify how much per cent, they would care to
have deducted from their monthly screw as war-
fund contributions, the authorities will kindly
impound it for them. So far, the teachers have
not responded very generously, nearly all prefer-
ring the voluntary subscription to outside funds
This is a remarkably ungrateful proceeding, inas-
much as the pedagogues were informed that
Minister Drake warmly approved of the monthly-
deduction method.

The relief of Ladysmith drove a number
of more or less reputable Melb. citizens into a
frenzy of patriotism and alcohol. During the
whole afternoon a yelling mob, which seemed to
be possessed by several devils, lurched up and
down Collins-street waving toy flags and howling
itself hoarse with “Soldiers of the Queen” and
“Gorsave.” The supreme object sc ;med to be
to yell in front of the Age office, howl outside the
flag-disfigured Argus establishment, and then
rush back and yell some more. It was astonishing
to learn that the silk-hatted personages who
danced like mad Mullahs in the lead of the ex-
cited horde of errand-boys of the bull-dog breed
were respectable members of Melb. Stock Ex-
change airing their loyalty.
During those stockjobbers’ Ladysmith diversions
one indiscreet individual inadvertently remained
hatted—he formally doffed his cady when the
singing began but put it on again because of his
extreme baldness and the rain. Somebody took
the hat off for him, and when he turned to
remonstrate someone else jabbed him in one eye
with a toy flag, and in the other with his fist.
Then the inadvertent person felt that he was being
hustled with much boot force. When he emerged
gasping from the tussle his pockets had been
emptied of a watch, some money, and a Tatt’s
ticket on the Newmarket.

Among the designs for a new war-stamp
issue sent in to Vic. Postal Department was one
by “a local clergyman,” in which, around a figure
of the Queen, gambolled elephants, lions, giraffes,
and springboks. “The only wild animals in
S’africa that have refused to dance to the prompt-
ings of loyalty,” wrote this genius “ are the Boers ;
but, if you look closely at the design, you will see
that the lions and other quadrupeds are blazing
away at them with lyddite and shrapnel, and are
now making them dance with terror.”

During a lull in the war-news the other
day Adelaide Hospital Board delighted the public
by producing a disturbance almost up to the
standard of the happy old strike-days. One
member accused another of being a liar and a
SCvtondrel, and was just on the point of elaborating
an accusation about an alleged shady mining
transaction when he was ruled out of order.
These disputes always terminate just when the
position is becoming really interesting.

About 50 per cent, of the people who paid
from ss. downwards to hear certain members of
the Vic. Parliament (and their female relatives)
five a painfully-amateur concert, at Melb. Town
[all, last week, were Chosen people. The array
of noses in the front chairs and side balconies
suggested that the political management of
Victoria is pretty much in the hands of
the Tribes. ,
A lot of people hard-up for grievances
growl at the protracted absence from N.S.W. of
Earl Beauchamp. Now, where is the man who, if
he were young, and as delicate as the Governor
looks, and endowed with .£30,000 a year, would
live in Sydney during the summer ? Of course,
Lord Beauchamp’s vagabondage constitutes a
forcible plea for the abolition of State Governors.
It may suit the book of the Colonial Office to keep
a Governor in every Australian province, but, so
far as this country is concerned, imported Govern
ors are mischievous where they aren’t merely
useless.

The plague excitement will shortly out-
strip the war-fever in Sydney if the evening press
can manage to bring about that desirable result.
Already one paper, which prides itself on its de-
scriptive writing, has arisen to wonder with some-
thing between a gasp and a chuckle “ if the cry of
‘ Bring our your Dead ! ’ ” will shortly be heard in
the plague-stricken city. Recently a dead rat
was located under a shop in a big street. The
trader had been reading plague-reports and the
Board of Health President’s appeals for ratty
information, and he promptly ’phoned to that
official, and to the City Council, and informed
them that a rat-corpse was under his premises.
He demanded that assistance be sent him as, in
addition to the sanitary danger, traffic was avoid-
ing the neighborhood, and people hurried past
with a pained expression. Both tribunals repu-
diated responsibility and declined aid, and now an
excited tradesman thinks of appealing to the Fire
Brigade and the Admiral and the Permanent
Artillery, and of writing to the press suggesting a
special session of Parliament to deal with the
case.
* * * *
A N.S.W. solicitor was suspended for 18
months by the Full Court, last week, for diverting
to his own use a client’s paltry £O, and another
was utterly wiped off the roll for a similar offence.
The profession of a gentleman by Act of Parlia-
ment walks some rough country in N.S.W. just
now. The attorneys’ list lengthens by leaps and
bounds, and, as not one newly-made practitioner
in a dozen has either the brains or the opportuni-
ties essential to making a practice, many of
those who get on to the roll have to accept small
billets in big offices ; or they sink to being instru-
ments in shady money-lending deals, combined
with “speculative” actions— i.e., blackmail. The
present writer personally knows of one full-fledged
attorney, a very level-headed man, who gets less
than £2 a week in the service of a big legal
firm; and he is aware that many competent
Sydney law-clerks are working for £1 weekly and
under, so dreadful has legal competition become.
And the condition of the junior Bar is, all things
considered, quite as lamentable. There are dozens
of barristers, supposed to be in practice, who are
not seen inside a court once in a blue moon, and
this scribe lately heard, on fairly good authority,
of one unfortunate who had earned eight guineas
for the year —not his first year either —and of two
others whose total bag for 1899 was £1 11s. Gd. and
£3 9s. 6d. respectively.
A N.S.W. Judge, a short time back, fiercely de-
nounced applauding a jury’s verdict as “an inde-
cency and contempt ” in a court of law ; yet, the
other day. when he dropped a poor little starveling
joke from the Bench, and the junior Bar, poor
souls, laughed till bystanders’ heads ached, his
Honor indulgently smilecL

To the N.S. Wales Bar the year just
closed has been the “ frostiest ” within legal
memory. The top-rung seniors did next to noth-
ing, and one Q.C. actually pursued and captured a
District Court Judgeship. The two exceptions
were Wise —who now, in point of practice, is dis-
tinctly the leader of IST. S. W. Bar —and Reid, who
has been doing very well.

A pitiable pettiness of spirit is exhibited
by most of the “great” Australian dailies. Melb.
Aoe, during the present war, has consistently de-
clined to mention the name of Melbourne Herald,
the correspondent of which Major Reay—is
always referred to as “the representative of a
Melb. evening paper. ” This, considering that the
Herald is the only Melbourne evening journal, is
OUR VERNACULAR.
TEACHER : “What is the meaning of mistake? ”
YOUNG AUSTRALIA (eagerly) : “Pleassir, bloomer!”
about as silly as it is spiteful. Even when Reay
visited the grave of Lambie, the Age’s own cor-
respondent, the latter could not bring itself to
print the name of its reptile contemporary.

A Loyal British Subject explains to the
editor of Melb ’Erald how it happened that
Roberts’ 50,000 men were too many for Cronje’s
5000 to 10,000: “ The Day of Intercession was kept
on Sunday, the 11th ult. On the following Saturday
hews was received of the relief of Kimberley.
This is a late instance of the efficacy of prayer,
but there are many such told in the pages of Bri-
tish history.” Chad band is blind to all Truth ex-
cept the Terewth he snuffles. The war in South
Africa is between a fraternity of fanatical
pietists and an army of irreverent jokers who, for
.the most part, make use of shocking expressions
in their hour of need. And the result promises to
be an indirect testimonial to the efficacy of bad
language.

i'J'WAS sunny Manly, by the sea,
The season was astir,
And she seemed very fond of me —
And I just worshipped her!
Our introduction though, I think,
Was nothing more than this:
She answered my emphatic wink
By blowing me a kiss .
We hung about the pier at night,
Or strolled upon the sands;
And when we sighed with all our might
We squeezed each other’s hands.
I don’t know why we sighed like mad ;
I don’t know why we squeezed;
I only know that when we had
Our minds were greatly eased!
But Love, I found, was like the tide,
Which came and slipp’d away;
I noticed that my future bride
Was “ not the same ” one day.
“ You love me not! ” I sadly said,
My heart with passion rent;
“ Go back to Tom, and Jack, and Fred,
And Harry! ’’—and she went.
And I, declaring Love a fraud,
And her a fraud as tvell,
Went back to Lil, and May, and Maud,
And Madge, and Blanche, and Nell!

A BIRD CALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The birds are calling !
The thrush lets float
His tender note,
Out through the trees.
Like lightest breeze
Come echoes back ;
Alas! Alack!
For you are gone, I am alone—
Though birds are calling!
The same black-bird
Has past me whirred—
The same I swear,
You mocked last year ;
With sweetest stave
You wooed the knave :
But now you keep a silent sleep—
Though birds are calling !
They may not break
Your rest, or wake
Your dreams with God ;
I kiss the rod—
But, ah ! last year
When you were here !
Now I alone, with heart of stone,
Hear birds a’ calling !

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, March 6, 1000.
Mr Dear Myee,—
We watched the Bushmen’s march-past last
Wednesday from the balcony of Her Majesty’s
Hotel. Mrs. Schneider in a black and white
check shed her broken English and kindly deeds
upon us, and gave us chairs for our feet, and the
stone balustrade to sit on. Between times, she
mentioned that she would soon open a “tream” of a
supper room for theatre-goers, and we dreamed of
when that would come to pass, and watched and
waited. Winifred was with me. At exciting
moments she told me what toques in the crowd
below were home-made.
A fleshless, bloodless, hollow-cheeked man, and
very little, talked loud on the pavement. From
the balcony his white face turned our way and
made a sort of yellow patch among dark masses of
clothes. Snatches of his talk floated up. The
war, of course, and this was a patriot. “It makes
my blood boil,” was what that white, bloodless,
horribly well-bred little man was saying.
Winifred wasn’t interested in him. She was
telling me to admire the smart frocking of some-
one on Farmer’s balcony opposite. The day
was grey but not chilly, now warm, now raining
a little, and very difficult to dress for : it was not
everyone who can look nice on such a day. So I
admired a skirt of navy-blue cashmere, a tucked
navy-blue silk blouse, and a big round yoke—not
transparent, and much rounded in front—of ecru
lace, and a cosy red hat that didn’t look like every
other red hat. How it managed that 1 can’t toll
you. It was turned back with red flowers crushed
against the brim, but other red hats have also
been turned back. Strange that most red hats
should suggest all the red hats ever seen. Because
black hats, which might indeed be expected to
look like all other black hats, keep their individu-
ality always.
Then the red hat faded, music sounded, we
looked away up the street.
In the grey light a long line of white-clad men
came marching. We looked up the long white
line. The grey light caught in their guns and
flashed back whitely. Then scarlet and tawny
brown got mixed with the picture. It was so
beautiful. The scarlet-and-brown Lancers, and
that white light shining from the white uniform of
the Naval Brigade. We forgot all about the war
and the reason of it all, and clutched at the picture
as one might at the picture of a beautiful woman
with a rotten heart.
Then the Bushmen were in sight. The crowds
went Triad. The great brown horses came prancing
and frettiug down the narrow wav between the
masses of people. Nobody minded what would
have been a terror at another time. Children
actually pushed at the dangerous legs. One little
boy was kicked on the head and killed. How all
the others escaped is wonderful. The crowds
Eressed forward and forward until the horsemen
ad almost to ride over their feet. Just in front of
our balcony a horse began to buck-jump. Imagine
it in that narrow space, with horses crowding on
him from behind. He rose up into the air
magnificently, but Bushie stuck to him with equal
magnificence, and the crowd was properly grateful
for the little sensation thrown in extra.
As they rode they looked up right and left; fine
faces, good faces, kindly faces. I thought of
what one of them had said to me, “I never think
of killing, I always think of being killed.” That,
then, must be why soldiers do not wear the mur-
derer’s look.
They were stuck all over with flowers, leaves,
ribbons. They rode past pretty quickly, snatch-
ing aiid squeezing hundreds of hands as they rode,
laughing, throwing kisses, merry, handsome, with
superb, prancing homes, a picture, always a
beautiful picture, that some people chiefly
Bushie3 —will never forget.
“As the Bushies passed, a woman behind me
leaned over my shoulder, and remarked on the
point of my flattened shoulder-blade that she didn’t
think they had any right to send out good-looking
fellows like that. Why couldn’t they send the
cripples ? As soon as I got a chance I looked for
her. No, not young, not beautiful! What you
might call sensible, in short.
We followed the Picture to the end. Down to
the Quay, on to the Newcastle. You could tell at
a glance it was a Government invitation boat.
They always fight for the tea 0naG.1.8., even
ladies in respectable black bonnets and mantles
cuffing the horrid men who tried to edge in
between them and the table. And when they
have had their tea they sit about in the torpid
peace that follows Government seed-cake. Society
women were unrepresented. A few Ministers
came on board late, and stood out against the sun-
set where the crowd could see them and aim such
witticisms as “ Woods and Coal,” “Sit down and
be Wise,” “ Sir William Lyne,” and others that
have mercifully escaped remembrance by now.
The other National Disaster—that million and
a-lialf of champagne lost in the falling-in of the
French wine-cellars —leaves broken hearts all over
the world, I believe that the grief of the gour-
mets is too deep for words. Already heaps of
elderly gentlemen are unconsciously getting ready
to remember 1900 by that horrible fizz out.
Apropos of the war, I have received another
circular from St. Vincent’s Hospital calling
another meeting to “consider the advisability of
postponing the annual ball in sympathy with the
present feeling of many friends of the Hospital
owing to the war in South Africa.”
How strange ! Next thing may be that the
hospitals themselves are “closed in sympathy
with the present feeling of many friends of the
Hospital owing to the war in South Africa.”
By the way, anyone who isn’t going without
new frocks for the reason just alluded to may find
some rather good ideas for the coming season in
the account of dresses worn at a recent English
race-meeting:—
Sandown races were favored with capital
weather considering the lateness of the season.
There were some extremely pretty dresses and
wearers present. One of the best made and most
striking costumes, worn by a slender fair woman
on the first day, was composed of a skirt of violet
cloth, tucked round the hem with a four-inch wide
entredeux of violet velvet. The coat to the waist
was of violet velvet, and was cut short across the
front to show a white satin waistcoat embroidered
with pale silks, a high collar of chinchilla at the
back of the coat, and revers of black and white
silk. A violet velvet toque with ostrich feathers,
and a cream lace cravat and white kid gloves
completed a charming costume. Another simple
but effective costume was a skirt of black cloth,
short coat of white-faced cloth, with collar and
muff of ermine. The high-crowned hat was of
mouse-colored tucked velvet, with folded tucked
brim of crushed-strawberry velvet, and feathers of
the same. Another girl looked smart in a bright-
blue cloth, the skirt strapped with stitching in
waved lines to the waist. The coat, which wasquite
short, had a white silk collar stitched with blue,
and the hat was of piped black silk with under-
brim of white silk stitched with black, turned up
on one side with Neapolitan violets, and loops of
black velvet and tulle in the front. A tall woman
with auburn hair was becomingly dressed in
rather a bright green frieze, with revers and high
collar at the back of chinchilla, edged witli a flat
border of black and white silk ; the coat was but-
toned down the front and cut away, forming a
tablier of the skirt underneath, and Reaching
nearly to the edge of the skirt at the back, and
stitched all round with white stitchiuers. The
toque was of green relieved with black. Another
neat dress was of black cloth, the skirt and coat
braided in black and white skirt braid. White
velvet hat turned up in front with grebe and bunch
of cock’s feathers, and a fluffy white boa was worn
round the neck. The white boas and muffs are as
popular as ever, and very becoming they are to
most people. There were several short coats of
caracule and musquash, and most of the smartest
dresses were trimmed with deep silk fringe.
Several ladies wore the Creole earrings—large
gold loops—but they only become a few faces, and
are not as popular as the single pearl drop. A
beautiful dress was of white cloth with deep hem
of sable, cape of sable, and toque of white cloth
with edge of sable and brown ostrich-feathers.
Re “Trilby,” I learn that Miss Maud Dai-
ry m pie, the unseen singer, is a pupil of Mr. Frank
Downs, a well-known local artist.
A Sydney songstress—popular Marie Narelle,
who always holds her audience in her hand,
as it were—has something to say about the
alleged “nearness” of the Brasseys. Last Cup-
time, being over in Melbourne, she was engaged
by Lady Brassey to sing at an “At Home” at
Government House. Mr. Corkran, the private
sec. to our Ex., spoke feelingly of her singing to
Lord Richard Neville; that was how the engage-
ment happened. Miss Narelle duly went, sang,
and conquered. And, very soon after, she re-
ceived a nice little letter of thanks from Lady
Brassey, and (you are not expecting this, perhaps)
a remarkably generous cheque for her services,
which is more than our own Govt. House ever does
for our warblers.
The other day, a well-meaning young lady sang
“The Absent-Minded Beggar” to—whom do you
think ? To the lunatic patients at Callan Park !
What a change of scene at the Lyceum, and of
frocking, in Holloway’s latest flare up, “ Defender
of the Faith.” The play is fixed up most
gorgeously. All the dresses are specially imported
and quite new. Elizabethan extravagances flaunt
in a continual succession of bright colours and rich
stuffs, the men as well as the women falling in for
lovely costumes that wipe out at a sweep all the
old memories of dyed satin melodramas at 7|d. a
yard that used to arise and stalk about this melo-
dramatic haunt. Nothing of that sort now. Dora
de Winton is blessed with three quite enviable
toilettes. No lis a sky-blue brocade with the
high Elizabethan lace collar studded with pearls,
slashed Huguenot sleeves and a lovely ornament
in her hair of two pearl doves caught together with
chains of pearls ; No. 2 a leaf green silk, with a
broad hem of white satin at the bottom of the long
skirt, and traceries worked in leaf green ribbon
over the white satin ; No. 3 a clinging dove-grey
embroidered in steel grey cloak, with long stole
ends of steel, that fits tightly to the back, and falls
away to reveal a hint of warm flesh-pink.
Fair-haired Ida Gresham is a sort of wandering
Gypsy with a starving boy. She Wanders and
starves in rich silk-rug stuff and a long brown cloak
—such a smart Gypsy get-up ; and her little 1 103' —
pretty Beatrice Holloway—begs for crusts in two
beautiful costumes—each more so than the other,
I take this eccentricity to mean that Holloway is
determined to spare no cost to make things gor-
geous.
Mr. Saunders—the Riley of the Lyceum audi-
ences—makes more picturesqueness m a purple
panne suit, and in moments of excitement shows a
deep yellow lining ; and Miss Roland Watts-Phil-
lips, in a grey frock and grey hairs, gives a startl-
ing idea of the lunatic she is (mercifully for admir-
ing playgoers) preserved from being. The play,
by-the-way, bangs hard at the one true church,
and already 1 hear the crunching of fine pens and
weak ink as the inevitable newspaper controversy
gets ready to burst over the releegious play. Mind
you, you only smell them getting burnt.
I had a chat on Tuesday with Miss Nance
O’Neil, behind the scenes at the Koval, with
“Magda” rehearsing all round us. Calling on
her at the hotel, you meet first a most charming
specimen of the colored tire-woman, a swarthy,
black-haired woman, with low drawling voice, who
acts as maid and chaperone to her mistress,
and sits quietly on one side of the stage
while rehearsal is going on. At the rehearsal,
Miss O’Neil wore a sweeping frock of
black voile, tucked across the yoke, and made
in a large free style that exactly suited her large
fine figure. She was wearing a black velvet hat,
trimmed with one huge brown bird, and tipped
right down over her nose in front, and turned up
with yellow roses at the back. She is very tall,
plump, and fair, with light brown hair, blue eyes,
and serious Gibson expression. And smart—yes,
decidedly smart, although she uttered a
wish that many busy women will echo —
that frocks just growed. A Californian girl,
she went on the stage first in ’93. Her favorite
part, she told me, is Magda, also a favorite part of
Bernhardt’s. In Peg Woffington she is going to
wear some lovely frocks ; most of her gowns are
from Paris, via New York ; but naturally, having
mentioned her passionate love of tragedy, and
tragedy above everything else, she doesn’t seem to
know very much about what she is going to wear
in her long repertoire. Said I’epertoire includes
“The Jewess,” a piece wherein she made her
success in London, Lady Macbeth, “Camille,”
Peg Woffington, “ The School for Scandal,” and
several others.
Society news is so scarce just now that anyone
with fine feelings must forgive me for dragging
the opening of a new drapery shop into this
category. Not an ordinary draper’s shop, how-
ever. It was a swagger opening of a swagger
establishment, rushed by swagger people, and full
of swagger goods, that go forth to the world under
the swaggerest of local names. With all this
swagger it is good to hear that the head milliner
of Lassetter’s new branch is reported to get a
salary of £l2 a week.
Apropos of shop, as a set-off to N.S.W. Early
Closing Bill, England, has passed a Seats-Behind-
the-Counter-for-Shop-Assistants Act. Every girl
rejoices now in a shelf like arrangement which
springs back into obscurity when she rises
from it. This reform was tried somewhere
before, but the girl who made use of it
to any great extent was generally informed by the
manager that owing to an overplus of hands
“they” would be obliged, reluctantly, to dispense
with her services. The girls then discovered that
they really didn’t care to sit down—liked nothing
better than to stand up 12 hours per day and roost
on one leg when the other went to sleep. So
gradually the seats faded away, and philanthro-
pists said it just showed the impractibility of try-
ing to help people of that class. In one Sydney
emporium the gDla, cramped by many hours of
continuous standing, arid longing to relieve the
ache and the muscplar tension by any change of
posture, take turns in the weary afternoons to
crawl under the counter for a minute, merely to
shift the misery and ache to some new location.
The girl who is under the counter for the moment
is always liable to the sack, but another stands in
front of her whenever possible, while she does a
stretch arid a writhe, and tries to get rid of the
feeling that she is a racked heretic;
I hear that Mr. John See’s eldest daughter’s
wedding with Mr. Sam. Hordern’s eldest sou is
likely to be the very largest arid . brightest matri-
monial affair of the season. Slipped in with each
invitation' goes a little card that requests the thou-
sand invited ones to come early, as the church
(St. Jude’s, Rand wick) will only hold a limited
number. This is going to be a highly-decorated
and good-looking union all round, the bride being
one of the prettiest girls, and the bridegroom one
of the prettiest boys—fair, curly-haired, and pink
and white—in Sydney ; and the bridesmaids—
the Misses Hordern, at any rate —belonging to
that bewitching rose-bud order of young girldom
represented in Sydney by Burdekins, Horderns,
Westons, and other recent debutantes.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“Victoria’s Bushmen’s Corps owns some men
who could find their way through and over any
country. But one of their officers is feeling some-
what small at present. He got lost eight miles
out from Langwarrin. Hopelessly, miserably
lost. The sun was in the west, but that didn’t
help him ; he went off in every direction but the
right one, and when his men found him he was a
very limp, tame officer, who knew it was no use
pretending lie had stayed out in that bit of scrub
for fun.
“ Included among the men is one who has only
been in the province six months. He can’t ride,
and he can’t shoot; he is a good chap, and fine to
look at. He can’t fail to make a target for the
Boers. He and the aforesaid officer are plucky
enough, because they are going to get lost in an
African veldt, and then be shot by the enemy,
and their bones left to bleach in the sun and pro-
claim the folly of sending men out to work that
they know nothing about.
“Lord Dick Neville guarded the awesome
dignity of the great Dropper with the restless
vigilance of a watch-dog. For instance ! When
the illuminated mementoes of the Australian
Federal Convention, bearing the photos, of all the
premiers and a list of members’ names of the 17th
Parliament of Victoria, came fresh from the
printing-machine, a copy was shown, merely by
the way, to Lord Dick by a politician pluming
himself much on the neatness and order of the
design. ‘ Oh, it’s very naice, don’t you know,’
remarked Lord Dick, running into every nook and
comer of the print, ‘ but don’t you think it would
be, aw, naice, you know, to have His Excellency’s
name introduced in the memento?’ He spoke
nervously, and his ears grew rosy-red, then
added hastily, ‘ I think His Ex. would like it,
don’t you know.’ It was pointed out by the
ruffled politician that the committee had not con-
sidered it necessary, but he added without any
enthusiasm, ‘lf you really think the Guv’nor
would like it, we can have the tiling all altered.’
‘ I’m quite sure he would, don’t you know,’
answered the devoted aide, so the politician, in-
wardly blessing all belted earls, had to pack up the
whole pile of addresses, and at some expense and
much trouble, have His Excellency’s name squeezed
into a place of honor, over the list of office-bearers.
Thus did the overworked aide guard the ego of his
lord in buckram.
“The commanders of Victoria’s last two Con-
tingents—Col. Price and Captain Dobbin—are
newly-made widowers, and so disconsolate that
each has expressed a desire to perish on the field
of battle.
“The upper room in Melb. Town Hall resembles
nothing so much as a sweating den at present. It
is crowded every day with women, who work
feverishly at flannel garments for the soldiers.
There is the rattle of machines and female tongues,
the click of scissors, and over all hot, stifling air.
Mrs. (Major - General) Downes is very good-
tempered, and directs and helps to the best of her
ability, but many women get extremely worried.
‘ They’ve made seventy - four right legs for
pyjamas, and no left ones!’ cried one matron
wrathfully. ‘That comes of letting a guild take
work home..’ There are many stories concerning
the extraordinary garments turned out, but the
print pyjamas made bathing-gown pattern with a
running-string round the neck are perhaps the
most notable productions.
“In spite of strenuous efforts to prevent the
story becoming epidemic it has leaked out, and
Melbourne is smiling cavemously at adapper little
parson closely related to a local family of great
circumstance. The gilded sky-pilot started out
with three young ladies, with the intention of
riding to the home of two of the latter in Gipps-
land, and became hopelessly bushed just before
dark. When night fell, so did the rain, in floods,
with the result that three drenched and utterly
wretched little ladies and a water-logged clergy-
man spent the night huddled in a hollow tree over
a small fire which was kept going with great diffi-
culty. Early in the night the gallant parson stole
away to doss in a log of his own for propriety’s
sake, but the cold, and the damp, and the terror
of the girls brought him back to the fold and the
fire. In the morning the wet, weary, and woe-
begone excursionists found themselves not more
than half-a-mile from home, and the mud-en-
crusted and enfeebled minister realised for the
first time the utter inadequacy of scriptural
language to express keen emotion as the four
pilgrims paddled to the homestead.
Y ours affectionately,
GOGLI-GOULL.
The tight embrace of the tenacious Boer
on Ladysmith has at length been thrown off—a
relief which can be fully appreciated by the woman
who has exchanged the uncomfortable grip of an
ill-fitting corset for the soft embrace of the soul-
soothing P.D. The P.D.’s tender clasp is as
grateful to the fair wearer as the best boy’s most
thrilling hug.*
The first of the new steamers built by the
C amps,- of Philadelphia, for the Oceanic
(Sprecldes) Co. San Franciso-Sydney service, will
ieave Frisco for Australia in June. They will be
of 0000 tons and will Cost £200,000 each, will be
specially constructed for the trade—in which there
is much hot weather —and will be fitted with twin
screws. As matters stand, the steamer which
parted with its single propeller on the long,
dreary Frisco - Honolulu, Honolulu - Samoa or
Samoa-Auckland stage, right outside any steam
traffic but that of the monthly trips of the
line to which it belonged, would have a very poor
chance indeed of ultimate rescue —in that it would
have been drifting for at least a month before any
vessel could even set out in search. As the new
new ’Frisco mail steamers will run a steady
knots they will deliver the mails a couple of days
earlier, and will thus be formidable rivals, both as
letter and passenger-carriers, to the Suez Canal
liners.

The season for visiting the old country having
come round again, the upper four-hundred of Sydney are
booking passages for London, and as a safeguard are as
usual depositing their plate and other valuables in the
Sydney Safe Deposit. In many cases they are also rent-

case the rentals are very moderate, and the business of
the Deposit is, we learn, rapidly increasing. A visit is

Australia already has two newspaper

An old Port Fairy (Vic.) identity passed

One of the most eloquent preachers and

There is one thing to be said for the war,

Poor old Editor Campbell, who at the age
of 82 surrendered Bega (N.S.W.) Free Press a
couple of months ago, declaring that his long life
of journalism left lum without a penny, has died
in Bega Hospital. His books show over £lOOO
owing to him for advertisements and subscrip-
tions.
Stated that “General” Booth has given
instructions that all houses and land, the property
of the Salvation Army in Australia, are to be

tion of trusteeship or other. Simply, William
Booth.
“ All,” sighs Jos. Symes, “ all the old fun
and frolic of The Bulletin are gone ; all its
youthful pleasantry and mature-life humor are
fled.” Which recalls that somebody once re-
marked to editor Jerrold that “Punch isn’t what
it used to be.” “No,” replied Douglas J., “it
never was.”
The father of S. G. Hubbe, chief officer of
the South Australian Bushrangers’ Corps, was

generally adopted.
Understood that Matthew Davies is con-
tributing a son—Henry Arnold Davies —to the
Vic. Bushmen’s Contingent. Henry Arnold and
Co. was the name given to one of father Matthew’s
boom banks long ago, so the young man’s enlist-
ment looks quite right and proper. He will be
open to accept deposits (of lead) from the Boers.
Pen-picture of General Lord Roberts,
from a Victorian surgeon-major : —“ We have just
had a visit from Lord Roberts. He was intro-
duced to us, and shook hands with us all. Such a
small man, dressed as neatly as a lady, with little
feet, and such a pleasant face and kindly eye. We
have all fallen in love with him, he spoke so
nicely of us.”
Of the strike-leaders who were gaoled ta
Deniliquin for conspiracy during the last big in-
dustrial kick-up at Broken Hill, every single one
who remained in N.S.W. after serving his
sentence is now either an M.P. or a J.P. ; and
some of them are both. The names of a couple of
them were included in the last batch of magis-
trates gazetted.
The resignation of Dean Cowper, of St.
Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, is now daily ex-
pected, when it is surmised Archdeacon Langley
will take over the duties. The venerable Dean
was born in 1810, and has held his present posi-
tion for the last 42 years, The first office he held
in Australia was that of chaplain to the A. A.
Company, a post which he secured in England.
Sons of at least three patriots, who left
their respective fatherlands because of the oppres-
sion of foreign invaders, have joined the N.S.W.
contingents as officers. The father of one was a
comrade of Kossuth; that of a second was an
exiled Pole, for whom a Russian halter was pre-
pared. The third is a professional man whose
father’s family were among the victims of the
awful “ Sutherland Clearings ” in the early part of
the century. What is sauce for the gander is,
apparently, not sauce for the goslings.
Speculation is rife as to what N.S.W. Pre*
nher Lyne’s title will be. It goes without saying
that he will not accept a knighthood. That title
is now as cheap as dirt —-well, as C.M.G.-ships
were formerly. Again, knighthoods mean politi-
cal extinction —recent political history shows that
in Australia. P.C.-ships have lost the attraction
of novelty—though they are not an incumbrance
politically —the public not being educated up to
seeing titles after a man’s name. D.C.L., too,
has been overdone. Baronetcy might be accept-
able ; but to get an hereditary title a man must be
rich.
That story about Phil May having adopted
his uniquely skeleton-y style of drawing “to suit
the bad printing of The Bulletin ” has been
published a thousand times and is still going the
rounds. But it is all flam. Phil May drew in the
same “open” style before ever he put a line on
paper for this print. In fact, just after May’s
arrival in Australia a certain Sydney know-all one
day asked him “ why he didn’t finish his work
more.” “Look here,” replied Phil, “my game
is to see how much I can leave out. When
I manage to draw with half the lines I’ll want ten
times the money.”
Ebenezer Ward, “ father ” of S.A. Par-
liament, and the shocking example of S.A. poli-
tics, will have to fight for his Leg. Council seat at
the elections now pending. A young Sydney-
sider, Oscar Bailey, built somewhat on the lines
of W. A. Holman, is out on the “ advanced
Liberal” ticket, and going strong. Bailey is a
pushful youngster who, losing his first billet on
the Sydney daily press, tramped overland to
Adelaide via Broken Hill five or six years ago,
and soon impressed the natives with the excel-
lence of his shorthand work.
Henri Rochefort, who calls for subscrip-
tions in France for the purchase of a sword of
honor for Piet Gronje, was himself the recipient of
a sword from French residents of Sydne/ over a
quarter of a century ago. He and five others
escaped from New Caledonia to which penal
settlement they had been exiled for Communism,
and landed at Newcastle (N.S.W.) in March, ’74.
On April 11 following, Rochefort left Sydney for
the U.S. His comments afterwards in an Ameri-
can paper on some of the leading politicians of
Sydney were an amalgam of gall and wormwood.
John Douglas, autocrat of Thursday
Island, whose recently-issued brochure on North-
ern latitudes makes interesting reading, was as
much a journalist as a politician, and in editor
O’Carroll’s days supplied Brisbane Courier with
its best leaders. He is a Durham University man,
but has been half a century in Australia. He sat
in N.S.W. Parliament and was one of the best
speakers in the Assembly. Subsequently he
became Premier of Queensland. While Q. Agent-
General in London he contributed freely to the
magazines and had serious thoughts of settling
down to a literary life.
After years of hesitation, the Victorian
Government has granted a pension of £1 10s. per
week to the pioneer surveyor of Melbourne,
Robert Russell, and his wife, £1 to be continued
during the life of the survivor. The latter clause
is worthy of note in view of the fact that when
granting a small annuity to Graham Berry in
recognition of his public services, Vic. Parliament
made no provision for the paltry little allowance
being continued to the ex-Premier’s wife in the
event of his pre-deceasing her. Which (a man
and his wife being supposedly one and indivisible)
was surely the meanest, shabbiest thing ever done
by any legislature on earth.
When N.S.W. Fisheries Commissioners
were travelling from Jindabyne on
SnoWy River to Cooma they drew up
at a small half-way township for
lunch. While they were waiting, a
Monaro-youth pulled up in front of
the township pub. with a “had-been”
dray. Jack Want, after closely
inspecting it to see if it really was
a dray, remarked: “What a won-
derful climate they must have here—
why I knew that dray 30 years ago,
and it wasn’t a chicken then.”
“Oh ! ” said the youth in charge,
“If I’d a knowed you swell blokes
was here I’d ’ave druv the waggon
over —a real tip-topper up to date;
we calls it Federation.” “Ah,
well, it’s a pity you didn’t,” re-
marked Jack. “ But haven’t you
got a name for this one ? ” “ Oh,
yes, we calls this Anti-Federa-
tion,” replied the Monaro boy.
Then the band played.
Quite a charming story apropos of the
present S.A. Governor, told in a recent ecclesias-
tic’s autobiography : Hallam, the historian, was
asked by Tennyson for permission to name his
newly-born eldest son after him. Hallam felt
honored, and said so; but, at the same time, asked
why Tennyson didn’t name his first-bom after
himself. “ Ah,” said Tennyson, “suppose he’s a
fool! ”
The 1400 picked volunteers (including a
battery from the Hon. Artillery Co.) fitted out and
shipped to South Africa by the London Corporation
were a gay and festive spectacle when the Cockney

modest three half-crowns paid for an ordinary
Absent Minded Beggar suit. And now the A.M.

tone “ Heighteenandsix.”

“Jack Edgar,” of the Argus, who died
last week, was rotund and rubicund —the sort of
man to whom typhoid seems to cotton. His de-
mise takes a good man from Melb. journalism.
Born in the north of Ireland, he had much experi-
ence in Maoriland, his best yarns of which have
appeared in The Bulletin. He began Melb.
press work with the Herald in Little Collins-st.,
whence he went to the Evening Standard, and,
on its demise, back to the Herald, thence to the
Argus. He and war-correspondent Macdonald
were chums, and had collaborated in an Australian
novel, now being run in the Argus as a serial
under the pen-name “ Edgar-Macdonald.”
Waxellency Madden never misses a chance
of a good Jingo advt., but he should really get
some competent grammarian to edit his rooky
phrases. A kopje :
Victoria thanks you cordially for kind congratulations
on performances of her troops. Feels proud and honored
that they have shared glory and success of the great sol-
dier who yesterday splendidly crowned a life of signal
service to the Empire, and wiped away every trace of the
shameful blot which stained it 19 years before. Repeat
to Lord Roberts.
The public never before heard of a blot upon
“Bobs” 19 years ago, and that first-class fighting
man may be annoyed if he analyses things and
finds that Madden has called him “it.”
James Dick, .who gave £5OO to the “Bush-
men’s ” Contingent Fund, is the Glasgow leather
man. He came out to Australia 15 years ago on a
short business visit, had a look-in at Broken Hill
in its very early days, bought largely, put the
scrip in his portmanteau, and ere he could take it
out again found that numerous tens of thousands
had been added to his wealth. And thereupon he
did what no more than two others who have made
similar lucky “ punches ” have done —he sent out
a cheque big enough to build and equip a ward at
Broken Hill Hospital for the treatment of in-
jured miners and others. Mr. Dick is chief
shareholder in the long-worked and consistent
Mitchell’s Creek (N.S.W.) gold-mine.
To the late Duke of Westminster Australia
owes one of its very few oil-paintings by Turner.
Indeed, the “ Dunstanburgh Castle,” in Yie.
National Gallery, is the only undoubtedly genuine
Turner of importance this country possesses ; the
“ London Autumnal Morning,” of Sydney Gallery,
being catalogued merely as attributed to Turner.
The “ Dunstanburgh Castle ” represents a very
gloomy castle perched on the top of a bleak, steep
rock, beaten by dark-green seas. The official
catalogue is destitute of information as to its his-
tory, but a reference to Thornbury’s Life of Turner
shows that it was painted in 1798, and is therefore
a very early work, his first oil-painting having
been done in ’95. The Duke gave the picture to
the Melbourne Gallery 12 years ago.
“ C.F.” to The Bulletin :
“ Old Jack’s ” shabby little reminiscence about Henry
Kendall and a Waterloo pub., apart from its dubiousness,
falls rather flat seeing that there is no secret about that
failing on Kendall's part—which probably enabled “ Old
Jack ’’ to scrape acquaintance with him. But let me, as
one who is in a position to speak with better authority
than “ 0.J.,” deny the truth of his insinuation that Ken-
dall’s verses on Stenhouse were the outcome of a “ spuri-
ous and artificial enthusiasm.” On the contrary, they
were inspired by perhaps the happiest friendship the poet
ever formed. “Sensitive” Kendall undoubtedly was.
But “ vain ” —No ! The man was only too ready with
undue homage to literary wasters now forgotten. “With-
out the capacity of being contented with his gifts.” Well,
perhaps Kendall would have been happier as a smug,
self-complacent, work-a-day genius, but we mustn’t be
hard on the “divine discontent” that gave us “After
Many Years.” That Kendall “envied those with higher
gifts,” is' simply a large, unprovable assertion which could
be made about anybody. Apart from a not necessarily
melancholy reserve, Kendall could display a most sunny
and loveable nature, but the “ Old Jacks ” upon whom
he happened could see only one aspect of him. By the
way, “ Manasseh ” was written in Melbourne, 'not at the
“ Currency Lass.”
Two brothers, now awaiting trial at Perth
(W.A.), furnish the law with a large problem.
They are so much alike that, though a number of
witnesses appeared to swear that they did various
tilings, not one could say positively which thing
was done by which brother. In fact it seems an
open question, supposing the alleged crimes are
proved, whether Herbert did some of them and
Francis did the rest, or whether Herbert did some
of them disguised as himself and the rest while
calling himself his brother, or whether Francis
did them all, sometimes passing himself off
as Herbert for variety and change of air.
And if the offences were committed jointly
it has to be decided whether each man was
not passing himself off as the other at the time,
or both weren’t passing themselves off as the same
one, or one wasn’t disguised as both, or if there
isn’t a third brother exactly like each of them,
who was responsible, and who has sjnce fled.
Anyhow, each of them looks more like the other
than like himself, and if they have some money to
spend it should be a pleasant case for some in-
genious lawyer. A large fee and two defendants
who can’t be told apart are good materials to start
a lawsuit with.
One of Westralia’s richest men was very
illiterate, but, growing ashamed of seeing “ his
mark ” on his cheques instead of a signature, he
learned, with great difficulty, to sign his name. It
took much time and trouble to form the letters,
but he mastered the accomplishment, though, of
course, ignorant of what the signs meant. As
years went on the signs grew less and less legible.
A bulbous thing, with a bar on its waist, signified
“t”; “w” had several unnecessary legs ; “p”
had its head turned the wrong way, and a couple
of letters were lost altogether. However, the
bank knew what it meant, and regarded it as an
interesting curiosity. Banks have a book in
which are entered descriptions of such of their
clients as are obliged to use “ marks.” Some of
these descriptions are florid, some marvellously
curt, according to the mood of the clerk who hap-
pened to write them. Thus, one bank describes
William Jones, for future identification, as “Short
stature, naval walk, one very fine blue eye, the
other missing, gold stopping in front tooth.
Speaks in loud, mellow, resonant tones. Curly
luxuriant locks.” The next entry, presumably by
another clerk, is “ Andrew M , wears blue tie.”
He must have been a very tired and busy clerk
who made that entry. Probably the tie suggested
having been worn so long that it had become one
with Andrew M .

Maxwell’s fresh Life of Wellington has
some enlightenment on his relations with women.
He was as versatile in this way as Napoleon, but
Queen Victoria’s idolatry of the Duke has probably
led to the thing being kept rather dark. Maxwell’s
new matter includes hitherto unpublished corres-
pondence between the Iron Duke and the Lady
Salisbury of his time. She in some memoranda,
apologises for the Duke’s gay Lotharism, because
“ he never had a home.” His wife, Miss Pakenham,
had been an early passion, but her relatives so long
barred the marriage that he did not care for her at
all when he married her, but did it through a Quix-
otic sense of honor. He disliked his two sons, because
they were loungy aristocrats. His favorite was
Mrs. Arbuthnot and their liaison begun in Paris
after Waterloo. Her husband was as complaisant
as Sir W. Hamilton, with Nelson. She died in
1834. Wellington wore her miniature, suspended
from his neck by her own hair. After her death,
he could not bear to part with Arbuthnot, who al-
ways lived with him, at Apsley House, Strathfield-
saye, or Walmer.

“P.S.Q.”: “Old Sheepskins” wasn’t a
bad employer, but he never gave us or let us pick
any of the oranges amongst which we worked, so
we had recourse to helping ourselves on dark
nights, and were apparently always able to satisfy
him that the blame lay with the “travellers,” who
were constantly camped on tfie creek near by.
One night a pair of us sneaked in the darkness to
the orangery, plucked a bushel or so, took them up
to the hut, had a feed, burnt the skins, voiced our
experience of stolen fruit being the sweetest, and
turned in. Next morning when we ranged up for
orders, however, the old fellow singled us two out
and told us to come up to the office for our
cheques, remarking, with a grim smile, that a
glance at our pants would explain the situation to
us. We looked down, and saw curious marks in
blue raddle on the legs of our moles. The old
sinner had put lines of raddled worsted on pegs
round the orange trees !
The absolutely-perfect fisherman has come
to light at last; he was found at the end of a jetty

have reached up. He ain't afraid of anythink.”
cannot appreciate the true fascination of fishing
believe him to be a bit mad He was seen perched
out on the crazy jetty by a workman going to his
daily toil in early morning. The moiler observed
him again while returning in the evening. Next
morning the lone fisherman was still fishing, and
at night he was on the same spot, in the same atti-
tude, patiently expecting the same bite. At this
point the workman became curious and crawled
out upon the shattered landing to interview the
fixture. He found the persistent fisher to be a
white ancient with a face as blank as a broken
window, and a dull unemotional eye like a bullet.
“Had any luck?” asked the workman. “No,”
said the fisher with the air of a man to whom
nothing on earth mattered a rap. “Been here
long?” “ No, not so very.” “How long?” “Dunno.”
“Two days?” “Maybe.” “Ain’t you had a bite
yet?” “Oh, lots of time; I’m in no hurry.” At
this the workman had an uncanny chill, and went
away and reported the fisherman to the police, and
the patient one was arrested. His family claimed
him later, and explained that lie was an angler who
had gone mad, possibly through devotion to his art.
He was in the habit of going fishing in all sorts of
unlikely places, and dispassionately soaking a
worm in the vasty deep till called for. Sometimes
he caught fish and remained till they went bad all
round him, but generally he caught nothing, and,
anyhow, he would never come away until forcibly
removed. It is the opinion of people that his
skeleton will be discovered fishing off the rocks in
some -out-of-the-way place one of these days.
Meanwhile the old man is being kept at home with
two minnows in a tank, a pin, a worm, and a bib
of string. This is the perfect fisherman. No
fisherman is perfect until he is content to die of
old age fishing in a place where he knows there are
no fish, and can perish happily as long as his line
is keeping wet.
That well-known Sydney pigeon-shot, the
late Mr. Owen Friend, was one day out gunning
at -Port Hacking, and standing on Lilli Pilli Point
lie saw a grey horse on a point some 800yds. away.
“I believe I could drop that horse,” said Mr.
Friend, and, taking steady aim with a sporting
rifle, he was as good as his word. Some years
afterwards, talking about good shooting with a
number of crack shots, he remarked that he
reckoned the best shot he ever made was the
knocking over of a grey horse at Port Hacking,
whereupon Mr. Ted Blake, the present-day crack
shot, jumped up and cried, “Why, I’ve been
looking for you for the last four years ! ” It turned
out that the grey was a favorite hack of Mr.
Blake’s, turned out for a spell. This story ought
to end by an indignant owner collecting the value
of a grey horse with compound interest at 10 per
cent, and breaking the furniture with the other
man on a charge of cruelty to animals, but it
doesn’t. It merely ends in drinks. Almost
everything in Australia ends in drinks.

Re N.S.W. Central Division leases. A
portion of the press periodically tells us that the
great demand for land, as evidenced by the
crowded ballots, calls for the immediate throwing-
open of all valuable areas. Yet, at every bal-
lotting, the majority of ' applicants are total
strangers to the district. These men, travelling
all over the country, attend almost every ballot
of importance. In fact, more than 30 per cent, of
the applicants are mere adventurers, who, if suc-
cessful, sell out to the man who draws “second
horse.” No wonder the demand is “great! ”

“ Pel.” : Grebe or dabchicks do not
anchor their floating nests, which consequently
wander about with the wind. Eggs like small
duck-eggs, but murky brown in color, which tint
is possibly due to stain from the weeds of which
the nest is made. The swan makes her floating
nest of bulrushes very thick and broad, and
buoyant enough, when new, almost to sustain

“ Trotter”: When
travelling way-back an old
woman came out of a house
to meet me. She told me
she was living alone, and
had not seen anyone for
weeks. Her husband had
died two years ago, and her
sons were away looking for
work. They had bought a
640-acre block at £1 per
acre, and paid £4OO off it.
She could neither read nor
write, and had received
two letters from the Govern-
ment threatening to turn
her out if the balance and
interest were not paid up.
There had been a five-
years’ drought, and she
had nothing but a few
goats. She killed one now
and then, and sold the skin
to a dealer, or more likely
obtained something in ex-
change. She offered me dry
bread and a cup of
the inevitable post-
and-rail tea —all she
had, and all she had
had for months past.
I advised her to
throw the old place
up and go to Sydney,
but she would not
part with her bit of
God-forgotten land-
scape, and her only fear
was of being turned out.
She had never been away
from that district —if the
driving cloud of dust out-
side was definite enough to
be called a district. One of
her sons had lately come
home and nearly killed her
because she would not give him the few shillings
she had saved. He ultimately found the coin and
decamped with it.

T “ Werrimee”: “C.R.” (B. 3/2/’00) writes—
‘l The wallaby is smaller and darker than the ’poo.”
But, as ’roos are of several colors and various
sizes, according to age, how is a half-grown Too to
be distinguished from a full-grown wallaby ? A
bushman can certainly tell the one from the other,
but he can’t state what the difference is—beyond
that the former has shorter and slightly Lroader
ears, and one has to get to close quarters to see
that. Also, the Too never has tracks of his own
making. He will follow a cattle pad when at
leisure, but pursue him and he’ll leave it; whereas

“ W.H.F.” : The bilby, supposed by
“Xerxes” (8., 24/2/’00) to be peculiar to Central
N.S.W., is common in Western Queensland, espe-
cially about the Warrego, and in the region
between Charleville and Aramac, where it burrows
in the sand-hills. Being nocturnal in habits and
very fleet, it is seldom caught. In Q. it is called
the “ rabbit-rat.” Its colour varies from fawn to
slate, and its height is from 18in. to 2ft., but it is
very slender. It was known in Q. long before the
introduction of the rabbit, and is, in my opinion,
a variety of the Choeropus discovered by Sir
Thomas Mitchell on the Murray many years ago.

Sam Hall was a decent-enough sort of
chap when he joined the alluvial fossickers on the
Robinson one wet season, but he had picked up a
smattering of geology somehow, and aired it at
every opportunity. For this he used to be chaffed
by everybody except one taciturn old Scotchman,
who seemed to take Sam quite seriously. One day,
however, when Hall had been sinking a hard nine-
foot hole, and had just bottomed on an old drive,
old Donald strolled over to see how lie was getting
on ; took in the situation at a' glance,. and re-
marked, “ Eh, mon, Ah’m thinkin’ ye ha’ struck a

H. J. Mac. tells a true story vouched for
by incredible witnesses :
I rather like an interesting horse-lie ; but object to
reckless and undue exaggeration. Here’s a true horse-
yarn : Away back in the sixties my father owned an old
stock-horse named “ Jaekey.” I was then a cub 14 years
old ; and out of sheer devilment took my little hatchet
one day and felled a six-inch diameter string-bark sapling
across his back and broke it. (The horse’s back broke—
not the sapling.) Here was a mess 1 I thought of
the green-hide leg-rope and shuddered ! I ran howl-
ng to “Tom, the Blacksmith,” and explained mat-
ters ; and he came to my aid. He cut an eight-foot
“ splint” out of the sapling, and placing it along the old
horse’s back from the root of the tail to the space between
the ears, firmly lashed it in that position with ropes of
stringy-bark obtained from the aforesaid accursed sap-
ling. Then I led the nag away into a back-paddock,
and didn’t see him for 13 days, when I found him down
on his knees feeding “ quite comfortable, like ! ” Didn’t
see the old cuss again for 11 months, when suddenly he
came cantering up to the house with seven 15ft.
saplings growing out of the “splint,” and in the tallest
of the saplings a nest containing three young magpies,
all of which we captured ; and inside of ten weeks all of
them could whistle “Pretty Polly Perkins” admirably.
My father swore something awful at first ; but with the
aid of a tomahawk and a butcher’s knife in an hour’s
time he up-rooted the saplings and bound up the horse’s
wounds. A neighbor—a Hungarian named Mulrooney—
got all the blame in the matter.

only three species in Australia and Tasmania —
Cracticus torquatus, G. robustus, and C. fuscus ;
the two first mentioned common, but the latter
somewhat rare. They belong to -an order of Aus-
tralian birds, known as crow-shrikes, but are sepa-
rated yencrically from all magpies—the sharp hook
in the upper bill being an important generic dis-
tinction. [Exit the butcher-bird.—Ed. B.j

“Pelican”: In Feb., ’9B the lower Fitz-
roy, Q., had a remarkable visitation of cranes.
Day after day they flew over, oceanwards, in
countless numbers —blue, white, yellow, blue-and-

Egg Island, off Broadmount, was their destination
and a visit there was something to be remembered.

Dubbo (N.S.W.) was a lively place in the
days gone by. It degenerated with civilisation
and the advance of the iron horse. It is recorded

state of activity for three days and nights.

In N.S.W. the unemployed get from a
benevolent Govt, a little scrub-clearing or sand-
shifting, but in Queensland they are appointed in-
spectors or “experts.” On any of the lines you
will find the first-class smoking-carriages full of
said experts. The drummer, who in N.S.W. bosses
the station-master and pushes to the front in the
bar, has in Q. to take a back seat in favor of the
übiquitous expert. At a Warwick hotel recently
there were staying no less than five of them—
prickly-pear destruction, melon and pumpkins,
and so on.

“Shaker”: The Grassi experiment (8.,

conducted by the Italian Govt. 20 years ago, not
to conviqt the mosquito-—they missed that—but to
test a theory that gauze-enclosed houses would be
safe from the poisonous nocturnal vapours sup-
posed at that time to cause malarial fever. Suc-
cess was said to have been attained, and the
published account of this matter induced many
residents of the fever-stricken districts of N.Q.
(writer amongst them) to try the expedient of
always sleeping inside a cheesecloth net. The
result was generally satisfactory, and by the light
of recefit discoveries must be considered perfectly
so, as the apparent failures were probably due to
the sleeper having been bitten between sundown
and the time of retiring.

“ E.S.S.” : To enable a snake literally to

so that the wound could be inflicted without the

Old M‘Muckle was Scotch. Rising from

A MUDGEE CHAMPION
In the drought of ’97,
When the Cudgegong went dry,
We were sampling shandygaff in Millett’s bar.
“ This is my idee of ’eaven,”
Said a soaker with a sigh,
As he passed his empty pewter ; “ I’m Tom Carr,
An’ I’m Mudgee’s champion beer-tank— there you are ! ”
We were strangers—didn’t know him
From a sheet of stringy-bark ;
But we said we’d make a wager of a crown
That ten pints would overflow him,
And he rushed it like a shark,
And requested us to plank the money down—
Said he’d do it for the honor of the town.
Then we made a stipulation
That as fast as Millet drew
Each long-sleever, Carr had got to drink it down.
“ Right! ” said he, “my reputation
Is at stake, an’ Mudgee’s, too ;
An’ Go’ spare me days, I’ll bust or win that crown 1
Fill ’em up, ole Public-house, I’ll do ’em brown.”
And he did. He couldn’t get it
Fast enough. He bade us note
That both Millett and the pump were working well ;
Then he’d shut his eyes and let it
Slither down his awful throat
In a stream, without a gurgle or a spell.
And the word we used consists of “ h” and “ 1.”
As we parted up the dollar
Thomas said we ought to shout.
So we shouted—’twas a droughty day and year.

But I ain’t got any doubt
That yous fellers must be shtrangersh (hie) up here,
Or yous would a know’d me— mine’s (hie) pint o’ beer.”

A Clever Palmiste.
Incombatable evidence of the great interest now
taken in palmistry was given to a reporter by Miss
Ethel Bretnall at her consulting rooms, 16 Buck-
nell-street, Newtown. Miss Bretnall is acknow-
ledged to be one of the cleverest votaries of her
art, and her recital proved most interesting.
<£ We are informed, Miss Bretnall,” said the re-
porter, “that you have many clients, a fact due,
no doubt, to the correctness of your delineation ?
“Yes,” said the lady, modestly, “my clients
being satisfied introduce others.”
“ Will you tell us something of your life ?
“The most interesting event in my life has
really little to do with palmistry Some two years
ago, possibly through much confinement indoors,
I grew weak and listless. I lost all relish for food,
and suffered after every meal from the pams of
indigestion. I often had to lie awake through the
whole night, and in the morning rose with a head-
ache, quite worn out. Sometimes my sight be-
came quite dimmed, and everything seemed to be
going round. Later on the headaches were con-
stant, and, owing to the severe tightness of the
chest, I could hardly breathe. I tried many
remedies, but without benefit, and I became
faced and sallow. At last I commenced Dr. Wil-
liams’ pink pills. One box relieved me somewhat,
and after using five boxes all pain left me, my
appetite returned, N and I slept soundly. You can
see how well I look now, for the color has returned
to my cheeks, which have filled out considerably.
Indigestion, from which Miss Bretnall suffered
so severely, although often treated as a trivial
ailment, is one of the most intractable of diseases.
The remedy to be sought is something that will
enable the system to assimilate and derive benefit
from the food taken, which is the characteristic
effect of Dr. Williams’ pink pills, .bummer
weather often starts indigestion. When its effects
are felt, do not fly to purgatives which, at the
best, only give temporary relief, but use Dr. Wu-
liam’s’ pink pills, paying careful attention to the
directions. They have cured many other ailments
—impoverished blood, debility, St. Vitus’ dance,
comsumption, rheumatism. But mind you ask
for Dr. Williams’.*

Republican essay by an American judge
on long rags and flummery :
No man ever added a cubit to bis stature by dress. No
robe ever enlarged a man’s brain, ripened bis wisdom,
cleared his judgment, strengthened his purpose, or forti-
fied his honesty. If lie is a little man without a robe he is
contemptible in a robe. If a man is large without a robe
he is simply ludicrous in one. A robe used as a mark of
office is a relic of barbarism, a relic of the age when tinsel,
glitter, and flummery were thought to be necessary to
overawe the common people. And the robe can now per-
form no other function than that of humbugging the
people. A court which is worthy of the name needs no such
flimsy and ridiculous assistance in order to command the
confidence and respect of the community, and a court
which cannot command the respect and confidence of the
people without resorting to shams of this kind is incap-
able of doing any good, is incapable of protecting the
weak from being trampled down by the strong, and
should be wiped out of existence. This age and the
American people do not want mediaeval shams. They
want light—daylight, electric light, sunlight. They .ant
realities ; they want character; they want learnmg ; they
want good judgment ; they want independence ; and they
want these free from both barbaric and aristocratic sub-
terfuges. It is only weak minds that lean upon this
kind of bolstering.' Our age is superior to the middle
ages only as far as it has progressed beyond sham and for-
malism, lofty pomp and hollow and dull dignity, and asks
to be shown things just as they are. I am opposed
to pretence and to humbug, no matter whether found in
high stations or in low, and in my opinion, if the Ameri-
can people ever reach a point where they must put robes
upon their Judges or- any other officers in order to have
the highest respect for them, then Republican institu-
tions well be at ail end in this country' ; for men who can
be inspired by a gown are but little removed from those
who can draw inspiration from a wooden god, and neither
are fit to either enjoy or defend true political liberty.

piling up of the bawbees. One of Mac. s saving
devices was to sell his fat sheep to the butchers,
and buy back the heads at 6d. apiece—and no one
but a Scotchman knows how to make a sheep s
head serve as a square meal for a large family.
Butter and eggs were also unknown m the house
when prices were up ; then the family would eat
parritch and dry bread, and Mac would lay by
some more “siller.” A lady friend was once on a
visit when both butter and jam adorned the board
in honor of the unusual occurrence, and the fair
one proceeded to help herself liberally to both.
Mac. glowered at her for some time, and at length
drvly remarked : “Ye mun hae the jam, or ye
uiiui hae the butter, but ye munna hae both ;
and he saved meat a l so by the remark, for the
shock made the lady drop a slice of bread on the
floor, and it did for the dog’s dinner afterwards.
On another occasion an old shipmate, who had not
seen him for years, called and during a talk after
supper asked Mac. how it was that he had been so
lucky while he himself was no better off than when
],e started. Mac. scratched his head, and by way
of reply remarked : “ We’ll just pit oot the can le,
we can crack fine by the firelight ”—and therein
lay the whole secret of his success.

out, but this was before ’93, when bankers were
still little rustic tin gods. Better pay for oush
teachers would induce a better class of. young
person to tackle the present wretchedly ill-paid
labor of out-back school-teaching.

A recent writer on “ animal chivalry
records that “no self-respecting dog will bite a
female, except in the extremest need of self-
defence ; though I am sorry to say that the lady
herself, as a rule, has no scruple whatever about
punishing, to the full extent of her power any
individual of the opposite sex that happens to be
inferior to her in size or strength. And lie
relates an experience with a pack of woll-houncis
which refused to attack a vixen—adding that,
“ although a horse will promptly attack any other
horse which may interfere with him, either m the
field or in harness, he will very seldom attack a
mare. Mares, on the other hand, will attack
either their own or the opposite sex without the
slightest hesitation, yet I have never seen serious
O ’ retaliatory resistance offered by the latter. Is
there any Australian experience of this animal
chivalry ? ”

“ Eller ” : The N.S. W. Govt. -returns as to
the number of sheep killed by dingoes and wild
dogs also state that dingoes are on the increase in
the western districts, owing to the number ot rab-
bits always available for food when mutton is
off.” When is mutton off or likely to be ? And
when did the average dingo become fast enough
to catch the average bunny !
When the Aus-
tralian eclipse expe-
dition of 1871, under
Mr Ellery, was re-
turning from Cape
York, the steamer
anchored early one
afternoon off Card-
well. Presently a
shoal of 50 or 60
large sized sharks
came up. Many of
them were shot with
rifles, and others
were caught with
hooks, some of them
greedily taking as
bait bits which had
been chopped out of
their previously cap-
tured companions.
In the case of one
voracious monster
his weight coming
up the steamer’s side
broke off half a
square foot of his
lower jaw containing
the hook, and he fell
into the briny with
a prodigious splash.
The determined fish-
erman promptly
iixed the piece of jaw
to another hook and
line. In a few min-
utes the maimed fish
swallowed the lost
lit of himself, and
was hauled on deck
and despatched.
S - arks are cannibals.
Whenever one of
these footpads of the
sea was being hauled
out of the water, his
friends, seeing his
helpless position,
clustered round him
and bit mouthfuls
out of him. Newer
scientific theories are
that the shark is a
useful, plodding sea-
scavenger who is too
gradual to overtake
anything alive save
a squid or an oyster,
and who seldom kills
swimmers simply be-
cause the man who can’t keep ahead of him isn’t a

A Maoriland newspaper man has patented

WHISKY AND HEALTH.
Whisky of the right sort, such as the “ D.C.L.”

is often an invaluable remedy in disease. Note

Archbishcp Benson said Count Schouvaloff
gave him an example of how apostolic succession
is regarded in Russia. A priest came before one
of the inferior courts for habitual drunkenness.
The magistrate, the police, including the arresting
officer, and the spectators, all knelt down. Ihe
police-officer kissed the prisoners hand. Ihe
magistrate then called the prisoner a filthy
drunken beast, and ordered him to receive thirty
lashes. After they had been bestowed outside,
the prisoner was fetched in again, and trie
obeisance was repeated.

And, catching up a bottle with a woful exclamation,
“ Another blessed bit of bloomin’ blanky luck ! ” he said.
“ I bought that bloomin’ medicine for the blessed influ-

Some More Cornstalk Finance.
A curious side-light on the ways of N.S.W.
finance shines forth from the leaves of the newest
issue of the province’s Statistical Register
(Part I.). On page 34 Statistician Coghlan deals
with the annual expenditure on public works for
the past ten years, showing the amount of the
public works expenditure provided for by loan
in each year, and the amount provided for out of
revenue. New South Wales has been economising
of late years, and reforming, and swearing-off its
old sins—at least, it says it has been doing all
these things. It has reduced taxation, and cut
down expenditure, and it claims to have left off
having deficits, and demands credit for other
beautiful reforms. And the charge which
this paper brings against; it is that all these
things are a lie and a ifake ; and the only
thing it has done is ; to juggle with the
loan funds harder than it used to do. It
has reduced expenditure by charging to loans
works that used to be paid out of revenue. It has
reduced deficits by charging to loans works that
used to be paid out of revenue. It has economised
by charging to loans works that used to be paid
out of revenue. It has done practically the whole
swindle of alleged reform by charging to loans
works that used to be paid out of revenue. And
in evidence here is, to begin ■with, an interesting
table of figures from page 34 of Part I. of this
year’s Statistical Register :

There are some interacting results to be deduced
from this table. In 1899 the year’s net expendi-
ture (as shown on page 28 of the work above-
mentioned) was £661,576 less than in 1891, but as
an alleged saving of £937,761 was made by charging
works to loans instead of revenue, it seems that
the ordinary cost of Government in the econo-
mical year was £276,185 more than in the extra-
vagant one. Other years are much the same—in
fact, this is how the table works out: —

This is a melancholy reflection on the alleged
economy of the last few years. Practically the
whole of the alleged savings were made by shift-
ing public works outlays into loan account, and
apart from this the year ended 30th June, 1899,
was actually the most expensive one in N.S.W.
history. In saying this, be it remembered, The
Bulletin isn’t demanding that salaries should be
cut down so that the country can be governed for
less than £9,00.4,195. It doesn’t want more rotten
economy ; what it complains of is too much
rotten economy. It wants to see the revenue put
up by extra taxation so that the country, as in
’9l, will be able to spend £1,486,803 on public
works apart from loans, and then it wants to see
the works charges, which have- been shifted from
revenue to loan account in order to make a pre-
tence at rotten economy, promptly shifted back
again. Also, it wants a law passed to absolutely
prohibit unproductive works being again put into
loan account, and to blight the financial humbugs
vViio gain credit as economical administrators by
doing this swindle.
* • * *
The total loan expenditure has certainly
diminished if 1899 is compared with 1891 and
1892. But the diminution has been effected by
shifting the bill for unproductive works out of
revenue into loans, and then shifting a still larger
expenditure on productive works out of the bill
altogether. For instance, the total loan expendi-
ture in 1899 was about £1,090,000 less than that of
’92, while the loan expenditure on railways was
£1,400,000 less. Therefore, Reid could boast that
he spent £1,000,000 less loan money than Dibbs,
and yet have room, on this item alone, to
charge to loans £400,000 for unproductive works
which Dibbs used to pay out of revenue. In 1894
Dibbs spent £1,330,046 of borrowed money of
which £508,069 Went in railways. In 1899 Reid
spent over £2,000,000 of loan money of which only
£400,142 went in railways. But the loan bill for
roads and bridges, which are not revenue-pro-
ducing, went up from £28,000 in ’94 to £113,000 in
’9.9 ; for fortifications from £48,000 to £53,000 ;
wharves from £140,000 to £177,000 ; harbors from
£41,000 to £50,000 ; administration of justice
(what an item to appear in loans !) from £4OOO to
£87,000 ; education, from £4OOO to £18,000; mis-
cellaneous buildings, from £40,000 to £80,000;
reclamation, from nothing to £lB,OOO ; alteration
of dredges, from nothing to £14,000 ; navigation,
from £l6O to £9000; rivers, from £47,000 to
£104,000; clearing land from nothing to £4445 ;
“ promoting settlement ” from nothing to £21,000;
and so on. Everywhere it is the same weary old
political fraud cropping up over and over again.
* * * *
Australia began its big loan policy with the
reasonably creditable idea of borrowing for the
purpose of constructing works which would yield
direct revenue and pay interest on the loans.
Incidentally the inflow of loan money created a
great boom, made a joyous state of prosperity
and saved incompetent legislators the trouble of
trying to solve the unemployed problem. When
the unemployed were numerous the politicians
borrowed harder and built productive works faster,
and thereby supplied employment. But the debt
and the railway mileage increased so much
faster than did the population, that a time
came when it was hard to find any more produc-
tive works to build. Then the loan policy,
according to the original plan, should have
stopped, or at least rested till population in-
creased. But that meant wrecking the boom,
and facing the unemployed problem, and coming
down from glory and riot to bread and cheese and
desperately hard work. So the State began to
borrow for partially productive works, and then
for wholly unproductive works, and it looks as if a
time would come when it would raise loans for
asphalting the back - blocks or for carrying
boulders out of one county into another,
merely to keep some shadow of the old boom
going. Also it gave up paying for works out of
revenue because the revenue was constantly strug-
gling to meet the iuterest bill, and because the
Customs income had to be largely sacrificed in the
interests of Freetrade, and because George Reid
wanted to keep office by working up a reputation
for economy. Now practically no new works,
however temporary and unproductive, are paid
for out of revenue, and only a part of the bill for
repairs. Where will it all end ? Up to time of
writing, ei"ht months of the financial year that
ends on 30th June, 1900, have elapsed, and, up to
now, the Lyne Government has been spending
loan-money at the rate of £2,300,000 a year, so
N.S.W. is progressing gaily on its way back to the
old boom-principles of ’9l and ’92, while the com- •
parative (only comparative) honesty with which
the money was applied in these days has gone to
join the late lamented diprotodon.

One Australian City Council recently took
to letting unfurnished apartments. The apart-
ments are high up and fitted with lots of conveni-
ences, and being somewhat expensive are hired
chiefly by a fine, full-blooded lot of tenants —and
you see funny things there sometimes. Three
bachelors took a suite of rooms, and one night
they were aroused by a violent beating on the
door and frantic appeals to ‘ ‘ Open and let me in,
he’s after me with a tommy-hork ! ” Hurriedly one
man rushed out of bed in his pyjamas and opened
the door, and a pretty little woman fell inside and
promptly took a fit of hysterics. As she was in
sleeping-gear this was embarrassing, and this
thoughtful young man called his companions for
support and advice. He heard hurried feet flying
down the passage, and looking out saw a gentle-
man armed with a small axe approaching with all
his might. The bachelor quickly closed the door
and locked it, and the listener came up and tapped
like thunder. ‘ ‘ What d’ye want ? ” inquired the
bachelor. “Kindly hand out that lady,” replied
the gentleman in a voice that suggested that he
was suffering from passion. The bachelor was
now joined by his two brother bachelors, and they
barricaded the door with the sofa and a table.
The man outside at backed it with the tomahawk
and soon effected a breach, but being prodded
hard through the or! See with a walking-stick he
became calmer and began to parley. He said he
only wanted to behead the lady on the staircase.
The bachelors refused to give her up, and told him
to call back in the morning. Then the angry
husband demanded in a shocked voice if they
meant to tell him that he had to leave his wife all
night with three unmarried strangers. One
cynical bachelor retorted that she would likely
meet a worse fate if she returned to her
husband and the tomahawk, and broke off the
parley. But as a guarantee that their in-
tentions were strictly honorable they allowed
him to look through the broken door and
see the lady locked in an inner room, and
they passed out the key. In the morning the
husband called round again and asked them what
they intended to do with his wife; were they
going to give her back to him or keep her alto-
gether. The bachelors declared that as they were
perfectly respectable they could not keep a lady
on the premises in night-gear, but on the other
hand they couldn’t hand her over without guaran-
tees for her personal safety. They asked the hus-
band if he was calm, and he gnashed his teeth and
said he was. They demanded that he should pass
her clothes through the breakage in the door. He
did. Then the two largest bachelors went out
with sticks and said the terms were these: The
husband was to pay the lady’s railway-fare home
to her father, and after that, if she liked to come
back to him, she might. He was to be held by two
bachelors while she got out. He was to buy a
new door, and apologise, and to stand a bottle of
whisky as satisfaction for the trouble given. And
after a hesitation that lasted through three rounds
he did all these things. There are many interest-
ing experiences in these places that are called
‘ ‘ residential chambers. ” ,
Stand Back and Then Look.
“ Madam,” said a wise old physician to a wir.uan
who had brought a feeble, anaemic, and poorly de-
veloped daughter to him for examination. ‘ ‘ Madam,
the treatment of this girl should have been begun
two hundred years ago.”
“Sir,” she exclaimed, “I don’t understand
what you mean.”
“ Probably not, madam,” replied this student of
men and medicine, “ and you wouldn’t even should
I try .to explain it.”
How do you best see a picture on the wall ? Why,
by standing back and looking through your
hollowed fist or through a tube. Well then, let us
first read Mrs. Coombes’ letter, and afterwards get
a little of what painters call perspective on it and
see if we can understand the lesson it teaches!
“In the spring of last year, 1895,” she says, “I
had an attack of pleurisy, which left me low and
weak. Subsequently I could not get up. my
strength, do what 1 would. My appetite was poor,
and after eating I had severe pains about my chest,
at my side, and between my shoulders. I had
muscular pains in my arms and shoulders—in fact,
all over me. I got little or no sleep, and felt
quite worn out in the morning.
“ As time went on I got weaker and weaker
and was scarcely able to get about. I came to be
so low that I thought 1 never should be better
again. 1 saw a doctor and took medicines, but
nothing did me any good.
“In December (1805) my sister, who lives at
Oxford, told me of the benefit she had derived
from Mother Seigel’s Syrup. I got a bottle from
Mr. Cooper, chemist, Oldbury Road, and after
taking it found great relief. I could eat well, and
food agreed with me.
“ I now gained strength, and after taking four
bottles was well as ever and free from all pain,
muscular or otherwise. I know others who' have
been benefited by the same medicine. You can
publish this statement as you like. (Signed)
Charlotte Coombes, 177 Oldbury Road, West
Smethwick, Birmingham, October Bth, 1896.”
That is her lettter—a plain, truthful, and well-
written letter. But what do we see behind the
simple facts as she sets them down ? Is there any-
thing suggested by that attack of pleurisy she
speaks of? Was that the beginning ? No. Pleurisy
is the name given to an inflammation of the spaces
or cavities in which the lungs rest. When the in-
flammation attacks the lungs themselves we call it
pneumonia ; if the bronchial tubes, bronchitis ;and
so on. But they are the same thing, from the same
cause—namely, impure blood. When the blood is
thus polluted, the smallest provocation—a slight
cold—may set up any of the above ailments.
Rheumatism (which Mrs. Coombes had) belongs
to the same group or family of maladies.
But how comes that impurity or corruption of
the blood in which these things arise ? I’ll tell you,
in the hope that you will remember it. Indigestion,
dyspepsia, fermentation of food in the stomach,
torpid liver, which leaves the bile acids in the
blood instead of removing them, poisonous dirt
and filth from the stomach getting into the cir-
culation—that’s what the trouble comes from. So
we see that in cases of pleurisy, &c., there is al-
ways what the doctors call a “ history ” of dys-
pepsia. Although this lady had keen dyspeptic
symptoms a fter the pleurisy, a previous imperfec-
tion of her digestion—whether she realised it or
not—laid the foundation for the pleurisy, the rheu-
matism and all that followed.
Now that is what we see as we stand back and
look. And this is the practical use you are to
make of the knowledge : Take care of the condi-
tion of your stomach, and the first day you feel
anything wrong with it, resort to Mother Seigel’s
Syrup without waiting to find out whether you are
going to be worse or not. When your house takes
fire you don’t wait to see how bad it is likely to be ;
you stop it immediately. Do so with indigestion.
The old doctor was right in what he said to the
woman about her daughter. The girl couldn’t
help the neglect of her ancestors ; but we can do
something towards taking care of ourselves.

A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
pres your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN

DISPLAY OF PRESENTS IS A PANORAMA OF LOVELINESS
OXS George-atreot <N EARLY OPPOSITE RAILWAY STATIOX), SYDNEY.
There is printed a cheerful little story of
a Burgundian priest who had shockingly bad
“houses” for his Sunday services when he first
came to the village. This made him sad. One
night he was blowing his weary spirit into a flutes
and at the end of the fantasia he heard shouts of
“ Encore! ’’—and found that the whole of the
godless community had taken kindly to the per-
formance. So he told them if they came to Mass
next Sunday he would give them another solo,
and from that time forth the tuneful father drew
crowded audiences, who swallowed moderate doses
of religion for the sake of the flute. If a priest’s
reedy melody can fill a church, what about the
saving grace of stringed instruments ? It is more
than likely that the Faith of the future will be
kept going by a brotherhood of ordained ’cellists,
The preacher will play an accompaniment to his
own discourse, introducing gentle Heaven or
gruesome H —l effects as the case may require,
and making the instrument answer his questions.
For instance, he will ask—“ls there any time
better than the present for seeking salva-a-tion ? ”
and the rich voice of the ’cello will utter a slow,
impressive “ No-o-o ! ”
Be par. about Edward Gibbon Wakefield
(8., 24/2/’00). The case mentioned was Wake-
field’s second attempt at abducting. His first
marriage was also an abduction. Wakefield was
a fine young man with champagne ideas and small-
beer pockets. He was ambitious, and wanted to
set the empire, if not the world, ablaze. But he
needed money, and he reckoned that life was too
short to make a fortune and carry out all these
brilliant ideas too. It was necessary to get
wealth straight away, and the only apparent way
to get it was through a rich wife. So he fixed his
auriferous eye upon Eliza Susan Pattle (dreadful
name !), a wealthy ward of Chancery. She was
guarded by a very vigilant mother and two pep-
pery uncles. Wakefield followed her from London
to Tunbridge Wells, and became fast friends with
the uncles by feigning a love for cock-fighting, by
which mania the uncles were possessed in real
earnest. The girl was willing, and one morning
Wakefield appeared with a carriage and drove off
with her. Outside the Park they changed to
another vehicle, set two dummies in their places,
and sent the carriage at a great rate along the
open road. The uncles mounted and armed in
haste, gave those dummies a terrific and terribly*
tliirsty chase for many miles, and overtook them
to find out that they had been fooled ; then they
retreated to the nearest ale-house with their
tongues hanging out, while Wakefield got clear
away, and married the girl, and over-persuaded
the Lord Chancellor, and made friends with his
mother-in-law. While his wife lived lie was
affluent; unfortunately she died early, and Wake-
field played tiie same game a second time and was
gaoled. Abductions and run-away marriages were
m the blood. The family was notorious for it for
generations. Wakefield’s own particular dad had
at the early age of 17, run off with and 'married a
girl, and afterwards contracted a bigamous and
secret marriage in Paris. One of Wakefield’s
brothers succeeded in running off with an Indian
princess, and had the luck to live merrily on her
money ever afterwards.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“The present ‘early-closing’ N.S.W.
Government should look at home,” writes a Bul-
letin correspondent. “ Its employes .on the
Grafton artesian-bore have to work 12 solid hours
at a shift. And this in a tropical climate where
a steamy 100 in the shade is much severer than
120 of dry heat. Three 8-hour shifts would give
better progress, anyhow.”
Brummagem Joe, to the Australian Pre-
miers : —“ How many Australians can you send
to save the Empire in South Africa ? Reply
paid.” Australian Premiers, to Brum. Joe :
“ About 800,000—in fact, every loyal Australian
with the exception of our loyal politicians,
preachers, and newspaper-men, who must remain
to draw their screws and save the Empire here.”
At least one N.S.W. Minister of the
Crown wishes to Heaven he had never blossomed
as a pamphleteer in early age : he lives in daily
dread of being faced with his erstwhile opinions on
a very vital question which his present position
grotesquely contradicts. No one pays much
attention to the resurrection of a Hansard
speech, but a cold-bloodedly-prepared pamphlet is
“ loaded ” all the time.
Sydney Evening News :
The Transvaal in the future must be governed by those
who live in it—not by a mere proportion of its inhabitants
who forcibly annexed it and maintain its original inhabit-
ants in bondage. And the Free State . . . can expect
no other treatment.
On this basis the Transvaal will be governed by
the Kaffirs, who outnumber Boers and Outlanders
two to one. And the Free State will be governed
by Boers and Kaffirs about equally, the Britisher,
who forms only the smallest fragment of the Free
State population, not having a look-in at all.
Does this wonderful organ know what it is ask-
ing? And how long would British rule last in
India if India was “ governed by those who live
in it ” instead ot by a mere fraction of the in-
habitants?
N.S.W. Parliament should readjust the
relations between District Court and Supreme
Court Judges, both in regard to duties
and salaries. Rogers, Q.C., and Heydon,
Q.C., as well as others, now District
Court Judges, have held commissions
as Acting Supreme Court Judges, and,
presumably, did their work well in that
capacity. They were then supposed to
be qualified for full judicial work. Now
they are restricted to civil cases under
£2OO and to criminal ones under capital
offences. Either, therefore, the Govt,
appoints to the D.C. Bench men too
food for that position or to the S.C.
iench men not good enough. If the
same class of qualities does for both, why
not abolish the more expensive crowd and
let the cheaper crowd do the work ? A
D.C. Judge draws £l5OO, an S.C. Judge
£2600 ; a D.C. Judge receives pension
of £750, an S.C. Judge one of £lB2O.
Seeing that the appointments are
made as if the Govt, drew names out
of a hat, this disproportion in pay is
remarkable.
Dear Bulletin. —In B. 3/2/’OO
you sav —“ In time he ” (Philp) “ be-
came Minister for Mines and later
Premier ; and in this current charac-
ter had the cool front last week to say
that N. Queensland does not want
separation.” Well, it doesnt! When
Philp stumped the country on the
separation ticket, the North had, for
years, been Brisbane’s very own
nigger and had been liberally wal-
loped all the time; therefore it
wanted to run away very badly in-
deed ; but since thenN.Q. has largely
thrown off the yoke and believes
that the time is coming when the
South will be its nigger for it to do
the walloping on. Consequently
it doesn’t want to run away any
more. Also £i.Q. doesn’t see any
advantage in being bossed by a
gang of boodlers located in Towns-
ville and maintained by the North
alone, in place of being bossed by prac-
tically the same boodlers located in Bris-
bane and jointly supported by North and
South ; so the separation-movement died
peacefully of general debility, and al-
though the remains are being kept in cola
storage in Townsville, they will probably
only be removed for burial. — Shaker.
Bogus “loyalty ” is exploded with a bang
by the terms of Chamberlain’s new request for
Australian mercenary troops. He offers ss. per
day, “ if they are employed outside Cape Colony
and Natal.” Anybody who goes had better make
sure of ss. per day anywhere; or he may find his
services valued at Is. or thereabouts on the
plea that he is employed within Cape Colony or
Natal. And the local loyalist mercenary isn’t
taking any Is.
Ex-Premier Dibbs’ proposal, obliging civil
servants to bear arms, errs seriously in two
respects. First, if carried into effect, it would
constitute the civil servants, a body already largely
removed from the general public, still further a
segregated body. It would add military caste to
civil-service caste. Secondly, because a man works
for the Govt, he should not, in the absence of a
law of conscription applying to all men, be obliged
both to fight also.
R.C. Archbishop Carr on patriotism and
good citizenship:—
It would contribute much to charity, peace, and union
if private citizens, like private soldiers, would, in cases of
doubt, leave to those in authority the duty and responsi-
bility of deciding the dread issues which war involves.
This is the gospel of meekness and lowliness for
the people in the presence of pastors and masters,
and “ it’s all right when you know ’em, but you’ve
got to know ’em first.”
David Syme makes a pretence of striking
one sane note in setting the face of the Age firmly
against the idea of making Australia a recruiting-
ground for the British army. David wants an
army of Australians for Australia, but for the
Empire’s use in cases of emergency. However, as
armies are only wanted in cases of emergency, it
would appear that Australia is to breed and rear
the soldiers at her own expense, and in the end
Britain is to “ get there just the same.”
Frank Clarke, M.L.A., the recently-
returned member for the Hastings and Macleay
(N.S.W.), is a considerably wiser man than before
his generous resignation in Barton’s favor, but he
has probably come out with a lower opinion of
human nature than he held during the Federal
campaign. His resignation in Barton’s favor was
a notable trump-card in the winning game, and
Federalists ought not to forget it —though it looks
remarkably as if they had forgotten. Even Barton
—but, ’nuf sed !
Ben Tillett’s influence in Australia was
nowhere deeper than at Broken Hill ; local
Laborites even chose him to lay the foundation-
stone of their new Trades Hall. And it was
largely the result of the little man’s insistence
upon the great value of municipal work that the
local Laborites, having securely filled all the
Parliamentary seats for the district, gave their
attention to the Municipal Council. The result
is that already Jabez Wright, local Trades Hall
boss, sits in the Mayor’s seat, which in the past
has been in the keeping of Zeb. Lane, Capt.
Piper, and other representatives of the mine-
owners.
HARD TO PLEASE.
HUSBAND: “’Ere ye art , dear, ’nazzer great
Boor’ish vic’ry. Stayed a bit late to bring the

WIFE: “Humph! you might have waited another
twenty minutes and brought the morning one.”
N.S.W. has had five Agents-General—
Mayne, Cowper, Forster, Samuel and Salomons—
since the office was made a paid one with resi-
dence in London. All of these were members of
a Government in N.S.W. before appointment to
the Agency-General. Daniel
Cooper has been Acting-
Agent-General, and Alex-
ander Stuart was ap-
pointed but died before
assuming office.
“ WHAT PL CE BELLY CONSOLS?”
Jimmy Ah-Catt, Tasmania’s Boss Celestial.
N.S.W. Marine Board’s last hope was that
the Navigation Amending Act would be declared
contrary to the English Shipping Acts ; and this
tope is now ruined. The Act is advertised as
coming into force this week. A big effort has
been made to shove the old Marine Board gang
into the new offices ; and the public wait with in-
terest to see how far it has been successful. If
Premier Lyne yields to' pressure, and nullifies the
new Act by administering it with the same old in-
competents, another nail will be driven into his
political coffin.
“X.Y.”: I found this in Blackie’s
Cyclopedia (art. Transvaal), a matter-of-fact
Scotch publication ■ •
The promises to the Boers on the subject of self-govern-
ing’ institutions made for the Home Government at the
time the country was annexed (1877) were not carried out.
Arbitrary officials and military martinets were appointed
to rule oil behalf of the Crown. By reason of their lack of
tact, as well as of irritating regulations and the non-
fulfilment of political engagements, friction was created
between the governing and the governed—the English
and the Boers. The spark which caused the explosion
that had its final and humiliating episode in Majuba was
an ill-timed enforcement of a petty tax.
The fashionable S. African Chartered Co.
counts amongst its shareholders, besides a host of
the plutocracy, numberless members of the aris-
tocracy, including close connections by mar-
riage of the royal family; and its employes,
agents, and journalistic and other hangers-
on form a small army, whose influence per-
meates every rank of society. But, despite
all the puffing it has had, the co. has
worked at heavy loss ever since its start.
Before the end of 1899 it had sunk in
Rhodesia about 5f millions sterling, and,
under ordinary circumstances, it had little
prospect of seeing even small interest
thereon. When the South African Repub-
lics have been grabbed, and John Bull’s
South African run consolidated and
rounded off by the practical expulsion of
the little selector, there will, with the huge
influx of population following on the war,
be a good prospect for the co.
It was indeed a shock to many people, of
divers political and other opinions, to see Dawson
and Lesina, M.’sP. of Queensland Labor party,
who have come south as delegates to an allegedly
democratic conference, lolling back in a carriage
in the N.S.W, Bushmen’s valedictory procession.
Dawson, leader of the Q. irreconcilables, and
Lesina, the erstwhile Sydney Domain repub-
lican and socialist, etc., etc., as supers in an
Imperialistic pageant ! Beside this the defection
of G. Republican Dibbs is a mere circumstance.
Sturdy John Burns, the British Labor member,
publicly stigmatised the South African regiments
as “Janissaries of the Jews ” —.but then, you have
to make allowances for present-day Parliamentary
Q. Radicalism.
One of the Johannesburg ’96 “ reformers”
writing in Capetown Argus (Rhodes’ paper)
declares emphatically that it was Lord Loch’s
ineptitude and weakness that betrayed both
Kruger and the genuine reform party. Under
the signature of “One who was betrayed,” this
writer, witli wonderful circumstantiality of detail,
virtually charges Lionel Phillips by name, and
nearly all the so-called “ reformers ” by implica-
tion, with cowardice and treachery both to the
British Government and the Boers. In proof, he
specifically refers to the declaration by the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange to President
Kri ger that it never invited Loch to the Trans-
vaa. when, as a matter of fact, documents were at
that time existent which went to demonstrate the
utter falsity of the statement. That one who is
palpably a Rhodesitd should thus write in Rhodes’
own paper, indicates that there are two distinct
parties among the “ first robbers” of the Rand.
Melbourne Punch item :
Let us sum up in one significant paragraph certain
matter we have scattered over a number during the past
few weeks. Eight or nine Australian foot regiments will
be permanently add 3d to the British Army. There will
also he about thirty regiments of mounted infantry, in
which Australians must have the preference. The silken
bonds of the Empire will be replaced by more useful ones
—of steel. [Probably misprint for steal.] The army
of occupation in South Africa must be largely composed of
Australians. Altogether there will be at least forty
thousand men called up from Australasia for regular
service under the British Crown. Australian instinct
opposes any separate navy ; all must be one. Australia
should cheerfully pay about a million sterling a year
towards the thirty millions that the British Navy will
cost.
Why, cert’iily ! Victoria’s share of the Australian
million would be about £330,000 a year, and
a trifle like that is a mere nothing. And yet,
about a year ago, Melbourne Punch howled that
the idea of raising some such sum in order to pay
for public works out of revenue was preposterous,
and said “ the money must be borrowed.” What
comes ot all the lamentations about the im-
possibility of paying for new railways and irriga-
tion works out of revenue if profligate Australia
has coin to throw away with both hands like this ?
Owing to the death of some and absence
from Australia of other N.S.W. Leg. Council
members, Premier Lyne is being pressed
to appoint about 10 new ones. He will,
should he yield, make a very bad
choice if he doesn’t do better than Riil
on his last try.
Omitted from notices of our long-ago
visitor, the lately-deceased MarqTtis of Queens;
berry, that his first wife deserted him in 1887 and
obtained a decree of nullity of marriage in ’9l.
The Queensberry motto is “Forward.” Awritir
years ago said the Marquis frequently drew his
pen through it on the family writing paper and
wrote in “ Backward.”
The wild screech that went up about the
Boer numbers and fortifications and other things
begins to sound ridiculous. When Cronje, in his
retreat, trekked right across the British front he
had, according to cable, 10,000 men. When tie
surrendered at Koodoosrand he had only 4300, yet
there did not seem to have been any holocaust
except of trek oxen and mules and other animals.
The lowest estimate of his force when he repulsed
the British at Magersfohtein was 25,000 men, and
his total losses by battle, disease, prisoners, and
desertion are estimated to have been 8000. The
discrepancy begins to look like frenzied exaggera-
tion. Also, all the devilish entanglements of
barbed wire in which the Highlanders were
caught now turn out to have been two parallel
barbed-wire fences erected by the Cape Govt, in
the days of the rinderpest to prevent infected cattle
from Bechuanaland and the Orange Free State
entering and infecting the colony. Truly we are
becoming an hysterical race. When 10,000 British
troops in fortified Ladysmith beat back with
heavy loss the attack of 20,000 Boers, we smiled
wisely and said the Briton was a much better
fighting man than the Boer. When about 10,000
Boers m a fortified position beat back 18,000
British, we howled loudly about overwhelming
numbers and barbed-wire entanglements. And
yet the root of the matter is that one man, of
whatever race, who can shoot straight and has
plenty of food, water, and cartridges behind a
rock, is as good as two or three out in the op^n.
Gladstone To Max Muller
wrote from Cannes, in 1883 : “I am recovering
the only great faculty which I ever possessed, the
faculty of sleep.” Insomnia is the first warning
the liver gives when overtaxed or tired
out or torpid. People often say, “I can’t make
out why I lie awake so at night. It is a new thing
for me. And during the day lam drowsy —feel
that I could fall asleep in my chair any moment.”
Continual loss of sleep is as fatal as a maxim gun.
Relieve the torpid condition of your liver by using
Warner’s Safe Cure, and normal sleep will soon be
yours. A cure just brought to our notice illustrates
this, and we have records of thousands of similar
ones.
Mrs. Emily C. Bottom, Kensington Park, S.A.,
whose husband is a traveller for the well-known
firm of CrOoks and Brooker, says : “I have great
pleasure in testifying to the value of Warner’s Safe
Cure as a cure for liver complaint. I suffered for
some years with severe pains in my back, causing
me to feel languid and not fit for my household
duties. I tried doctors’ prescriptions and other
remedies without success, and as a last resort, on
the recommendation of one of my friends, I tried
Warner’s Safe Cure, with the gratifying result
that I am perfectly cured.”

“ Put up the sword, States can be ruled without it.”

The present Sydney plague-scare demon-
strates the little practical value of local “sanitary
science.” The first alleged victim of the disease
was ill for four days, and died undiagnosed. That
will take a good deal of explaining. Then the
burial of the body was an admirable illustration of
how such things should not be done. The coffin
was “filled with a very strong disinfectant” (not
specified) and wrapped in sheets soaked in ditto,
carted from the house to a launch and carried
down the harbor to the Heads, where it was
buried. What is the matter with the old-fashioned
but effective method of filling the coffin with
quick-lime, and thus ensuring the rapid destruc-
tion of the body ? Also, why weren’t the remains
cremated ? That would put an end, once for all,
to one possible source of infection. As it is,
everything depends on the efficiency or otherwise
of the “disinfectants” used, and there is always a
doubt about that. And, finally, the people who
were actually engaged in nursing Dudley for the
first two days of his illness were allowed to carry
the supposed infection about with them for some-
thing like a week before anyone thought of
isolating them.
Just here it strikes Thk Bulletin that the
occasion is one which the advocates of a public
crematorium should not fail to improve. The
local authorities, no doubt, have at present got
the war delirium too badly to trouble much about
such a prosaic matter as the bubonic plague;
still, there may be lucid intervals, or, at all events,
moments of reactionary depression, in which the
voice of reason would be listened to upon a ques-
tion that will sooner or later force an answer from
the community.
The most Boer-hated man in Cape Colony
at present is probably veteran Brigadier-General
Brabant, who commands the new force of local
“ loyal mounted infantry.” Brabant, as an old
member of the Cape Legislature, knows who is
who among the suspected pro-Boers, and where to
look for incriminating evidence.
Melbourne had a £40,000 fire the other
day, and North Melbourne a £OOOO one, and in
each case the bulk of the damage arose through
the miserable inefficiency of the water supply.
Melbourne has a Board of Works, and the Board
has a chairman —the fearful bard Fitzgibbon. The
Board’s duties, according to its Act of Parliament,
include supplying water for the use of the in-
habitants, but the incredible Fitzgibbon holds that
the duty of supplying water for the use of the
inhabitants doesn’t include supplying water to
put out the inhabitant or his property if they
catch fire, and that it isn't the Board’s duty
to furnish enough water-pressure to reach the
top of a large building that is in flames. And
as no other body has power to interfere with the
water, Fitzgibbon really holds that the supply of
water for fire extinction is nobody’s business; also
when anybody alludes to the subject at the Board’s
meetings Fitz G. rules them out of order with a
shriek and orders them to sit down with a roar.
Apparently unless someone promptly shifts Fitz-
gibbon and burns all his poems Melbourne stands
a good chance of being reduced to ashes.

Extraordinary war-paragraph from Sydney
Nurse B. E. Withey and her daughter have presented
Trooper 0. E. Kelleher, of “D” Squadron of the liush-
men’s Contingent, with an Italian greyhound.
An Italian greyhound ! Why not a pink-eyed
rabbit? Is this a joke of the Rhodes' lion order?
From Dunedin (M.L.) Star, Feb. 24 :
Wklunoton.—The Agent-General wires, under date
23rd: “ Conje fought well on Sunday, defeating all
attacks. Meanwhile General French got to the east of
him. He is expected to surrender, because the British
troops ore five to one.”

[The tone of this cable, together with others from th*
same source, lead to the impression that the
General s sympathies are not in the right quarter.] °
Poor Reeves !
“ 8.5.” : Thrift (in spite of “ Y.A.,”
8., 10/2/’00) is a sign of inferior race. A nation
doesn’t become great through thrift, but through
greed, robbery, and conquest, all of which facili-
tate spending and produce those conditions of
comfort which enable the race to reach its highest
development. When forced to practise thrift to
keep its place, a nation becomes small and mean
and sordid in its dealings, and the great intellects
that occasionally arise out of poverty serve only
as lurid side-lights upon the general deteriora-
tion. J lie downward trend due to narrowing life-
conditions is bust or slow in proportion to the
ongmal stamina of the race. Nations, like men
are only thrifty by compulsion, and heaven help
the country whose future depends on thrift!
America, with all its grit and “go,” is compara-
tively thriftless, while doddering powers like
China are the reverse. Thrift, in short, is not
only the “sign of an inferior race,” but carries in
it the germ of ultimate race-destruction.
A reporter's yarn :
~I fc was in the seventies, at Waimate (M.L.), that I and
the drudge of the opposition rag went to report a Parlia-
mentary candidate at Mudtown—Doublefurrow was his
name. We got there two hours before the candidate,
and drank Irish whisky that would burn a hole in vour
waistcoat if you spilt a drop. It had no effect on the
seasoned opposition-scrihe ; hut I was too overcome to
take a note, and returned to Waimate desperate. Editor
thunderstruck when 1 told him ; but presently he had a
brilliant idea. “ Look here, Tussock. You know all
about Vogel’s policy of Immigration, Public Works, and
Loans. Sit down and write just as you would
speak yourself on the subject, keeping Double-
furrows personality in view, ami throw in an
advocacy of the Abolition of the Provinces. Chances
are Doublefurrow doesn’t know what he did say.”
So with a wet towel round my head, I sat down to my
task, and, gradually wanning to the work, finished with a
booming peroration. The paper was published next day,
anil our inangie proved totally inadequate to satisfy Die
local thirst for copies of our influential organ. ”In the
name of Heaven, Tussock, where did you get that
report ? asked the opposition man ; but i was impene-
trable. ‘ts Mr. Tussock in ?” I heard someone inquiring
outside shortly afterwards. The voice was Double-
furrow’s. Instinctively I looked round for a weapon of
self-defence, when in rushed Doublefurrow in a state of
mild excitement. “My dear fellow !” he began, when,
seeing the ashy expression of my face, he paused and
inquired: “Are you unwell?” “ No—oh, no,” I
stammered as he shook me by the hand. “My dear
fellow, he repeated, shaking my arm up and down as if
it were a pump-handle, “ 1 have just run down to con-
gratulate you on the excellence of vour report. Not a
word left out. Everything just as I said it. I say, 1 wish
f, cou . * institute proceedings,” lie added impressively,
against that other beastly rag of a paper for misrepre-
sentation. In their report there’s not a single word I
said, i want a hundred copies of your paper, old man,
and, I say—come and have a drink ! **
Cycles in the Post Office.
Nearly two years ago. after careful investigation,
the Victorian Government adopted the Massey-
Harris Government Standard Bicycle for its postal
service. About the same time the New South Wales
Government selected Bicycles of half a dozen diff-
erent English, French, American, and Colonial makes
for its postal service. The result is worthy of note.
'1 he Massey-llarris Government Standard Bicycles
have cost the Victorian Government n/- per machine
for 15 months repair, mostly the result of careless
accidents. The other kinds have cost the N.S.W,
Government £ll/10/- per machine for repairs.
For several months past the Queensland Govern-
ment have been investigating bicycles for its postal
service, and have selected the Massey-Harris, and
the Massey-Harris only. Why? Evidently because
they thought it better to buy a Bicycle with a good
reputation than a repair bill.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Wise William Forrester’s first attempt to win a
Newmarket Handicap proved a gorgeous success, for
Watch Dog rushed to the front as soon as the 25 starters
had shaken down into their positions, and the big chest-
nut gelding led them all the way. Moreover, the stable
put the excellence of its favorite beyond doubt by scoring
a “ place ” with the much inferior Saraswati. Watch
Dog, on paper, had only a fair chance of achieving New-
market honors, but Forrester s confidence (he went out of
his way to make his friends back the “ moral ”) and the
mighty voice of the market persuaded a good many
doubtful punters to put a trifle on the Dog against their
early inclinations. The mere fact that it went out at a
short price to run for a man who makes few mistakes
was a very strong tip, or at any rate a tip not to be de-
spised.
The Leger and the Essendon Stakes results set
punters ruminating on the vanity of equine greatness.
Merriwee, the hero of Melb. Cup meeting, cut up like a
comparative commoner behind Parthian in Saturday’s
classic race. Bobadil, a brilliant-star performer this time
last year, started at 10 to 1 for the w.f.a. Essendon Stakes,
and ran accordingly. The triumphant crack of to-day is
the gone-wronger of to-morrow, and vice versa, and
nothing is certain except inconsistency in the modern
gee-gees’ “ form.” Times have changed since James White
and Donald Wallace gave the racing-world something to
swear by.
For all that is known to the contrary, 5-year-old
Eiridsdale may be the best weight-carrier in Australia
just now. Up to Saturda3‘ the son of Eiridspord had done
nothing impressive outside of Tasmania, but his run-away
victory, in Essendon Stakes, was undoubtedly a big per-
formance. Carrying 9.3 he scooted over the rather heavy
la-mile course in 2.391, with Wait-a-Bit and the Maori-
land representative, Seahorse, toiling far behind his tail.
Plungers laid 6t04 on Seahorse—the same odds that had
been cheerfully laid on Merriwee for the Leger—and down
they went again. Strange to say, the 11 to 8 odds laid on
Finland were landed in handsome style. It isn’t often
that I key Mo has to complain of a red-hot favorite
winning a 2-year-old race.
M.L. crack, Seahorse, broke up badly in Essen-
don Stakes. Going out a (j-to-4-on favorite, he
was beaten at the turn and finished fourth.
This endorsed suspicions lurking in the minds
of scribes and touts that he was not ri*dib.
His preparation was too hurried. Almost immediately
after landing, those responsible prescribed “ fast work ’’
which developed indications of lameness. And the ex-
planation that he always limped silenced further com-
ment. Taking a line on Saturday’s display, the colt a
top-sawyer beyond question—will not do himself justice
for some time to come.
• * • •
Fleet Admiral was almost fit enough to win a
race last Saturday. After he had run fifth in the New-
market, and seeming none the worse for the gallop Fleet
Admiral was started (favorite) for the Brunswick Stakes—
a racehorse among duffers—and managed to beat every-
thing but Caledonia. If his legs hold good through the
meeting he should improve on Saturday’s efforts
• * • *
At Rand wick on Saturday Carberra showed her-
self a consistent and game mare. In the weight-for-age
mile race she ran a bitter Crush with Brazen Lad, who
beat her by a short head, and in the Alexandra Stakes It
imle, Arquebus looked all over a winner until Carberra
fairly wore the little fellow down and won by a head
* • * »
Havelock was heavily backed at Rand wick on
Saturday for the Hurdle Race, but he made such a miser-
able showing that the committee was evidently of the
same opinion as the public as to the horse’s mission, so an
inquiry was held into his running. Explanations, how-
ever , were deemed satisfactory, and he was discharged
without a stain on his character. Aberdare was the only
other horse backed to any extent, but he fell, and the
winner turned up in Statesman 11., who won in the fast
time of 3min. 49.jsec. Statesman has been trained at
Moorefield on very unorthodox lines, as he has been run-
ning most of the time out on the green Hats. Judging
from the time and the. strong way in which Statesman
finished, it is doubtful if Aberdare would have won had he
kept on his legs.
* * * *
The three greys among ten starters for A..T.C.
Hurdles made themselves conspicuous. Landmark came
a cropper at the first jump. Rube Adcock’s Statesman 11,
led from start to finish, and Sybil was at the other
extreme all the time.
* * * •
Randwick on Saturday did some clock-smash-
ing. Keys’ Invader-Babette 4-year-old mare Victory sur-
prised punters by getting away with Denison Stakes
(6 fur.) and winning comfortably—easing off, in fact—in
1.13| —only a fraction slower than Ivirry’s record (1,13) in
Challenge Stakes at Randwick last year. Four-vear-old
Bob, by Bowmont-Swift, made an exhibition of the rest
of the field in Trial Stakes (7 fur.), which he won in 1.274
—half a second outside record (standing in Trieste’s name
and established at Flemington over 8 vears Both
instances serve to show the fallacy of taking” time as a
guide.
* * * *
The up-country performer Bob, who raked in a
double at Randwick on Saturday, is a good cut of a black
horse by Bowmont—Swift. He has a peculiarly loose
unfinished style of moving, but has plenty of “ foot ’’
and takes catching in the final rush. A better-lookin'*
nag is Glenore, who ran second to Bob in the Trial Ilandf-
cap. He is a fine, well-grown three-.vear-old colt by the
sensational Ruenalf, and promises to make a name for
himself.
• * * »
Coincidence backers should have collected to a
man on the Invader mare Vietorv, at Randwick, on
Saturday, as he couldn’t well lose with all the latest war-
news tipping “ Victory, by Invader.” The two “ Bobs”
for the double was also a most appropriate investment
which shouldn’t have been missed, whilst a far-seeing
seeker of war-tips could easily connect Statesman with
warfare, and a bit of luck would have put him on to
Carberra, whose sire, Carbine, suggests fight. It’s gener-
ally easy to pick winners after the races.
• * « •
The thoroughness of Mr. “Torn” Muir’s judg-
ment in paying 1450 guineas for Grand Flaneur-Archeress
colt Parthian last spring was further accentuated by
latter’s pronounced victory in V.R.C. St. Leger on
Saturday. The whilom owner of the speedv North
British and many other top-notchers said that Parthian
was the best of the 3-year-olds, and would prove himself
better than Melb. Cup winner Merriwee when they raced
together again. Merriwee started (> to 4on and Parthian
2to 1 against. Latter led from end to end, and literally
ran away with the money, winfling up six lengths in
front of the favorite. Time (3tn. 12sec.) was not fast:
The Officer (in ’97) and Bobadil (last year) put up 3.6 i.
Mr. “Bill” Long (N.S.W.) bred Parthian, also Patron
(who won in ’94), and owned the sire of both—winner of
the same honors 19 years back. It is worth mentioning
that the late Mr. Jas. White appropriated V.R.C. St.
Leger five times successively. In Dreadnought’s year
(’9O). Singapore was the only other starter.
The Tod Sloane method of riding waa much in
evidence at opening of V.R.C. Autumn Meeting
on Saturday, and in each instance easy wins were
recorded. Barden adopted it on Parthian (St. Leger) and
* . Kuhn on both The Watchdog (Newmarket) and Cale-
donia (Brunswick Stakes).
* * • *
The re-opening of crack jockey Fielder's case
brought no good to him. A.J.C. committee decided last
inursday to let the embargo remain, hence if no amelior-
ating influence gets to work meanwhile, Fielder will be a
stranger to registered meetings for three years, by which
time he will almost have qualified for that’refuge of iocks
too fat and too old—the position of trainer. So-called
fresh evidence,” from the adjudicating body’s point of
view, only tended to emphasise owner’s and trainer’s
innocence without making Fielder’s culpability appear
one whit less strong. Most turfites and others «ho con-
cerned themselves about the matter seemed confident
that the ban would be lifted, but writer held the opposite
opinion. "
' * • * •
Brighton and Forest Lodge courses (Sydney)
are livening up the trotters, and it only rests with the
owners to make the events of sufficient interest for them
to remain a weekly fixture at the courses mentioned. At
Brighton last Friday Bess was made favorite, but she
shaped badly, and it remained for Nancy and Favorite to
fight it out. J. Hudson, who drove Nancy a patient and
well-judged race, passed Favorite a quarter of a mile from
home and won comfortably. Nancy started 18sec.
behind, and trotted her 1£ mile at a 2.42 gait.
* * » ’*
Martini-Henry-Pretoria mare Precaution died
at Canterbury (Sydney) last week. Her chief performance
was winning Carrington Stakes at Randwick in 1.134
thus making a “best,” until Kirry came along and
clipped oft half a sec. There was a field of 24 that dav
and they had a S.E gale behind them. The mare never
got within coo-ee of this achievement since ; she leaves a
record bristling with disappointments.

Broken Hill James, who has established a stud
farm near Kapunda, S. A., had his first sale of youngsters
in Adelaide lately—mostly Broken Hill and Light Artil-
lery Stock. But Adelaide hasn’t a share-boom in blast
just now, and so it stayed away from the sale. Conse-
quently less than a dozen yearlings were sold ; and most
of them were taken, at prices that can’t pay for their
rearing, for shipment to the West. The best price was
£O3 for a Light Artillery colt.

“ Spudz”: Far Niente, sire of the colt Sequence,
recalls the Melb. sporting scribe’s brilliant paragraph line
—“ Each time this youngster (some nag of the time)
makes his d6l»ut he runs prominently, and he is sure to

scribes, the most illiterate, easiest-billeted, and, generally’
best-dressed of pressmen, love to assume the learning
that they have not—and are “ whales ” for (motes from

The finding of suitable names for racehorses
severely tries the originality of some owners. “ Teddy ”

Ancient : Travelled one day in a railway

ject of Hon. James White’s phenomenal run of
luck on the turf came up. “ I don’t believe White
ever ran a stiff ’un,” said a veteran owner, “ but the
reason may have been the fact that under the peculiar
circumstances of his case it was not necessary. Many’s
the time I have hail a first-rate show in races won by

there was a bigger percentage of stiffs than triers in many
of the races won by White ; otherwise he would have been

a recent Randwick meet to back three consecutive winners
with the same “ Booky,” and on joyfully presenting his

Interprovincial bruising-battle between heavy-
weights, Ted Sullivan (Vic.) and Tim Nolan (N.S.W ).
occurred at Golden Gate A.O. (Sydney), Saturday night,
Neither is a champion. Sullivan’s left might just as Tveli
have been at home resting for all the use it was to him.
Nolan floundered round hitting anywhere, anvhow, and
any time. So did Sullivan, but Nolan’s punches appa-
rently carried most powder or they were luckier in land-
ing on soft places, for the Cabbage-garden man was the
S”* ni s,g , nals of distress, and he continued flying
them till a soul-case-shaking uppercut loaded with sting
caused his knees to sag and the whole lot of him to drop
with a thud. Nolan and Sullivan, together with a dozen
more of their own calibre, would need a mighty lot of
luck to lick any sort of decent champion, but there are
no real champions in Australia just now.
Lubber : Naval engagement for lightweight
championship of the Australian fleet attracted 500 sailors,
marines and others to Metropolitan A.C. (Sydney) Satur-

savage. Anns whirled, shoulders crashed, backs bumped
and tars round the ring screeched with excitement, but
no harm resulted ; not the faintest indication of the ruby
showed, nor was the slightest trace of a “ mouse ” visible.
They hooked on to each other at least a dozen times in
the second round, and that referee with the penetrating
voice shrieked “ break ! ” in the shrillest of falsettos with-
out avail; he had to go between them and taste mis-
chanee. By-and-bye Wade got a few punches home on
the ribs and tween wind and water, with the result that

one round. Yet the referee with the pocket-book and

“Old Timer”: A word re the little dodges and
wiles of present-day crop of seconds and how they work
allegedly up-fco-snuff referees. A principal goes to pieces
or only gets “ that tired feeling” and wants to hang out
time a bit so as to pull himself together. There’s a
vigorous rally on, when suddenly one of the tired man’s
seconds calls the referee’s attention to the fact of one of
two glove-laces being free (they were deliberately loosened
in the corner). Hostilities are stopped and several seconds
of the round occupied in adjusting strings. Meantime
the played-out man recuperates and finishes the round
comparatively strong. If he feels queer again same dodge
is resorted to with same result. Another little game is to
throw oil a shoe which has to be put on by the owner’s
seconds, who don't hurry the operation much. Writer
remembers old Jim Barron (a few months ago) being
behind a man who got such a grievous period in one
round that he didn t get over it during the minute’s spell
and was receiver-general from the beginning of the next—
m fact, looked a certain loser—when suddenly his shoe
came off. The cute Jim occupied a minute and a half
putting that slipper on again. That chap fluked the

Rev. G.W. York, preaching in Nelson
(M.L.) Cathedral, attributed the defeats at
Nicholson’s Nek, Magersfontein, and Stormberg
to the fact that they occurred on the Sabbath, in-
ferring that if those battles had been fought on
common week days, the results might have been
different. But how about Oom Paul’s people?
Didn’t they fight on the Sabbath too? If the
British deserved to be licked for Sabbath fight, so
did the doppers of the Transvaal. And wasn’t
Waterloo, which set Britain up in business as
boss nation, fought on Sunday ?

ing are a model of simplicity, and should find a ready
sale amongst country residents who are desirous of a
light which, for brilliancy, is equal to the electric. They
also exhibited novelties in bicycle lamps, which were
lighted by simply pressing a button ; also a table lamp,
which would extinguish itself if upset, and thereby be the
means of saving life and property.*
The joys of a sailor’s life. A salt sends
The Bulletin “ a bit of the real thing ” :
About 12 months ago I was mate of a four-master bound
from New York to Java. We had a full crew of American
niggers, and I soon found that two-thirds of them were
rank duffers. Only three out of the crowd in fact were
able to put two ends of a rope together. Yet they were
all on the ship’s articles as A.B.’s (able-bellied they cer-
tainly were). However, after much trouble, and a pas-
sage of 15 weeks, we reached Sourabaya, and
found cholera and malarial fever cutting off the
natives faster than the phlegmatic Dutch authorities
could “ plant ” them. These diseases soon got amongst
my crew, and eight of them died during 56 days
we lay in Sourabaya waters days of hard graft,
misery and sickness. At the end of that time the ship
was ready for sea again—down to Plimsoll with sugar—
and with orders for Delaware Breakwater. We ho 1
shipped four Dutch seamen, but when we took our depar-
ture from Lapoedie Light five of the niggers were on the
sick-list, and two days out we buried three of them.
Seventeen mortal davs we were then tacking through
Bali Straits, and 70 more to the Cape, with mostly either
terrific weather or dead calms. Four months out we found
that owing to an ungetatable leak in the tank the fresh water
supply' was dwindling. The allowance had, therefore, to
he shortened, and soon after the steward discovered that
owing to our delayed voyage the provisions would only
spin out about 20 more days. So, the ship being still
south of the line, the B.T. “ pound and pint” scale had to
be grievously cut down. Next, the cook’s coal gave out ;
though. Irishman-like, he consoled us with the observa-
tion that it didn’t matter because “ divil a thing there
was to cook, anyway.” Next, beri-beri got hold of us—
the steward being first man down ; and, what with stink-
ing water and wretched food, in a week’s time he had
swollen to the size of two men. A solid 5A months we
had been out before a Yankee tug picked us up and towed
us in a practical wreck. Sides red with rust, clean out
of water, provisions and fuel, a fourth of the crew gone,
and nearly all the rest physically ruined for life.
Two hours later, all hands were swearing—over a welcome
feed of fresh meat and green stuff—that they’d be damned
if the sea ever caught them again ! This is a plain, un-
embellished record of what too often happens to the deep-
water sailor-man, and yet the dry-land poet whoops for
“A wet sheet and a flowing sea”—whatever that may
mean. I’d take long odds that the galoot who warbles—
“ A Sailor’s Life for Me 1 ” would be glad to change places
with a penal-servitude prisoner, after 170 days’ hard graft
on short rations in a disease-stricken wind-jammer.

Yon Kotze on memory :
Prof. Max Muller draws attention to the decffwence of
our memory. As if that sad fact needed any advertise-
ment. Gutenberg began the slaughter of mnemonics
and the up-to-date encyclopedia has finished the job off
successfully. Remarkable, however, are the freaks of our
remnant memory, its hysterical susceptibility to distrust,
its malicious stubbornness and the dangers of contagion.
For instance : We were only three white-men on a little
atoll in the Pacific, and the judge was topping off a disas-
trous critique on a certain novel we were discussing.
“ In short,” he concluded, “ the plot is inartistic and the
denouement is—er —is—” “ Oh,” interrupted his secre-
tary, “ you mean—ahem—you mean—er. Dash it 1 I
have the word on the tip of my tongue.” I watched them
amusedly, and at last graciously consented to help them
out. I knew the exact expression they were looking for.
I had it ready up to the moment of utterance. But when
I spoke it was gone, flown, leaving just a taste of its indi-
viduality in my mouth —enough to tantalise me, not suf-
ficient to track the absconder home. For weeks we three
wasted hours every day in a vain search after the little
brute. There was no dictionary on the island. We waded
through awful blue-books and unbearably drill official
literature in the remote hope of meeting it. For we knew
we would recognise it at once when we saw it. Our life
became a misery. In the midst of a lively debate one or
the other would all at once stop short, stare
ecstatically at the ceiling in a weird attitude of pain-
ful intentness, and the rest of us would silently, eagerly
watch him ; till slowly the hope began to fade out of his
face, the bodity tension relaxed, and with a sigh that we
heartily echoed he would return to the common-places of
existence. A casual stranger would have taken us for a
set of dangerous lunatics. But strangers were rare around
there, till one day the Governor arrived on a visit of
inspection, The bustle and anxiety attendant on the
ominous event drove the missing word out of its monopoly
for the nonce. We had other things to think of, and it
was with a silent prayer of praise we sat down to dinner,
having passed unscathed under the official eagle eye.
The Governor was holding forth and we listened respect-
fully. “There occurred to-day,” he remarked, “a little
incident, trivial ” He got no further than that.
With a yell like unto the shriek of a tribe of Bed Indians
burdened with scalps we sprang from our chairs, waving
our arms frantically, and performing a terrific war-dance
before the eyes of his horrified Excellency. “ Trivial!
Trivial 1 Of course, trivial 1 ” we all yelled in chorus, and
only when our guests rushed wildly out of the room did
we manage to cool down sufficiently for purposes of ex-
planation and apology. But the Governor was by no
means satisfied regarding our sanity, and thought the
lonesomeness had preyed on us.

Titheradge tells this story : He was playing a very fine
part and took his li tie giris to the theatre. In the cast
was a gorgeous soldier who always entered to a fanfare of
trumpets, and usually said “ Dispatches, your Highness,”
or something equally thrilling. The littie Tith. girls at
once established him as the hero and watched eagerly for
his entrances. Later in the play he faded out, to their
great disappointment, having apparently carried all the
letters. At last there was a burst of music and one of the
girls said excitedly “ Oh, there lie is ! Here he comes ! ”
Then, a moment later in deepest dejection, “No, it isn’t,
it’s only papa.”
“ Bensun ” : Theatrical co’s touring the back-country
should paste this in their hats —Don’t cater for intellect.
Not that there isn’t any, but bush-people don’t take any
to a play. Produce pieces full of action and turmoil and
broad jokes. Appropriateness doesn’t count. Facial
and figural grotesqueries always “score,” and the jam-
ming of somebody’s head in a tomato-pie or something
sends everybody away satisfied. Horseplay, hilarity and
idiocy are the only sure cards out-back.
Dan Barry’s latest absurdity is “ a drama of the Boer
war,” in which President Kruger chases the heroine with
illicitly-amorous intentions. The up-country intellect of
Victoria is educated in the awful iniquities of Boer Govern-
ment by means of little things like this — vide Dan Barry’s
bill—“ Act 3. Kruger in Love. The Wolf and the
Lamb.”
“S.”: Williamson has crowded a great wealth of girl
into the Melbourne version of his panto, and its ballets
from the moral and material point of view are quite un-
impeachable whilst the dressing of them is exquisite—not
a jarring note of colour in the whole 50 rows of delicious
femininity. But how slow, how deplorably sedate is that
long minuet ballet 1 Why are so much lovely goods and
such an army of human girl, fairly aching for a free leg
and a rousing gambol, devoted to a dance that hasn’t a
fleshly thrill in it from post to finish ? The best ballet
Australia has seen from a merely human point of view
was the rattling insurrection in petticoats and wild up-

The latest showman from Yankeeland is “ Dr. Frederic

For a week, at Sydney Criterion, during Ludwig
Amann’s turn, there have been wild yells for “ Cronje 1 ”
And on Saturday, Ludwig showed Cronje, and, in this
writer’s opinion, made a mess of him. The person shown
by the gifted Teuton was an intellectual-looking bushman,
whose whiskers had the peculiar softness that tells of
total abstinence of the razor. Also, they were the brown
whiskers of a man in his prime, and his face wore a sinis-
ter expression and a look of intense energy. Cronje is an
old man ; his grandson was taken prisoner with him at
Koodoosrand, and, 20 years ago, he had a son old enough
to fall in battle against the hated Englander. Also, he is
known among the Boers as “ Black Cronje,” on account
of his black hair and swarthy complexion, and is described
in several accounts of the Jamieson Raid as a stout, bulky
man, with a wide jaw, a grizzled head, and a heavy look.
Editor Bulletin. — Re “ Haresfoot’s ” remarks about
“The Dead Heart,” &e. (B. 3/3/’00). My father, in a letter
to Ben Webster, dated June, ’59, wrote:—“Of course,
they will make a play of Dickens’ new tale, ‘ The Two
Cities,’ and (if you have read it) you will see how the
character of the man * dug out ’ of the Bastille will clash
with the man in ‘ The Dead Heart,’ written more than
three years ago. Knowing your peculiar powers, I wrote
Robert Landry exclusively with a notion how you would
act that character, and foreseeing the reputation that
would arise to me ; and now, owing to a delay of years,
Dickens puts into words what I hoped long to see you put
into action. The tone of the resurrection from the Bas-
tille ought to have been fresh in my play—not in his
story. It is very heart-breaking ! ” Again, to his brother
Fred, he writes :—“ There is one thing that has vexed
me—the notion that my drama must be taken from some
French play or novel. It is from neither. My only bor-
rowing was from an incident in Carlyle’s ‘ History of the
Revolution,’ in which the old Marquis de Something
answers to the roll-call in place of his son, who is asleep,
and takes his place in the tumbril.”— R. Watts Phillips.
A good yarn about Lonnen’s father crops up among the
theatrical reminiscences of Fred Norton in Melb. Sun.
Lonnen pkre, who went by his family name of Champion,
was acting with Norton at the Adelphi, Liverpool, in the
days when a voracious public wanted two dramas and a
farce for its evening fare. Time was getting on, and there
was a train to catch ; so the two men got the tip from the
stage manager that they must close their scene and bring
the drama to something like a reasonable conclusion in
five minutes. Champion, as the villain, undertook to
receive a fatal stab from the heroic Norton, who
was to rush off shouting “Avenged!” or words to
that effect. After which a hasty curtain. But somehow
Champion, in the hurry of the moment, forgot the stab-
bing arrangement. When he saw Norton coming along
with a knife in his hand he shrieked “ I am shot! ” and
fell corpselike on the stage. This was a little too absurd
even for a Liverpool audience, and they laughed. The
curtain stuck half way and they smiled all the louder.
Whereupon Champion arose and said “ Respect the dead,
you Kaffirs.”
As usual the twin stars in a theatrical combination up
across down yonder hate each other like poison. Each
declares that she is the" Star of the evening, beautiful
star,” and wants the public warned to beware of spurious
imitations. A Johnnie who ought to have known better,
meeting one little lady in “sassiety” recently, started
saying nice things about the other. “Miss—whom did
you say ? ” asked the rival star, with a scornful tilt of the
nose. “Why, Miss Blank, of course.” “Oh, indeed;
and where is she appearing?” “Come, I say,” gasped
the Johnny, “ you’re joking. You act with her every
night.” “ Ah, yes, now you mention it, I have a vague
recollection of some such person,” said the pocket prima
donna sweeping away, stiff with dignity.
Hiatt’s new Life of Irving fills out some gaps. It
emphasises Irving’s obligations to Hoskins (our old
“ Billy ” H.) AVhen Hoskins acted at Sadler’s Wells, he
gave Irving a lesson at eight o’clock every morning.
Irving would have accompanied him to Australia, but
that Irving’s mother had a horror of her soil becoming an
actor. His father was a sort of ne’er-do-weel, like
Dickens’s, satirised as Micawber.
Miss Edith Berry, a daughter of grand old veteran
Graham Berry, has taken to the stage, and appears at
Sydney Royal on Saturday.
Most of the Grand Theatre, London, just burnt down,
dated back almost to the dawn of music-hall entertain-
ment in the little village. Forty years ago, when awful
men known as “ lion comiques,” garbed in bright green
coat, sealskin vest, and yellow pants, could make the for-
tune of a variety show by shouting “ Slap bang ! here we
are again,” the Philharmonic Hall was opened at Isling-
ton, and the Nonconformist Conscience of London’s
northern suburbs didn’t like it. The “ Phil.” was the
first important ’all to be built within the suburban
radius, but it didn’t loom large in cockney history until
it was converted into the Philharmonic Theatre, under
the ownership of one Charley Head, a gaudy bookmaker.
Lessee Charley Head found the money for what was con-
sidered a reckless experiment—the production of “Gene-
vieve de Brabant,” with ex-music-hall vocalist Emily
Soldene (nee Soldeni) in the name part. Up to
that time nobody had thought it possible to run
a new comic opera successfully at a suburban theatre.
All the same, “Genevieve de Brabant” caught the town,
and Emily Soldene’s somewhat middle-aged figure took a
front place among London stage idols, and, moreover, re-
tained the position for some time. The world of fashion
ordered its coachman to drive it to distant Islington,
whilst the flunkey on the box raised his eyebrows in re-
spectful horror. Book’s son, cook’s son, and son of a
millionaire rolled up to the “ Phil,” and went back to
“ town ” talking of the new opera bouffe, the new woman,
the gendarmes’ duet (old friend Johnny Wallace was one
of those two gendarmes), and the new naughty ballet.
Other successes—“ Madame Angot ” in particular—fol-
lowed “ Genevieve” at the Phil., and then its lucky star
snuffed out. The house having lost all the old prestige of
the old name was re-opened after a while as the Grand,
and was doing an uneventful business on modern subur-
ban theatre lines when the fire-fiend ate it up.
There are four small, mild ex-Melbourne amateurs in
Sheridan’s co. at the Royal.
The theatrical mind is keen to grasp essential facts.
In Sheridan’s living pictures at Melli. Royal the Boers are
represented in glaring crimson shirts.
P. Abbot on “ Comedy and Drama ”: “A Bulletin
writer once expressed surprise that the public should
prefer Bland Holt to Bob Brough. I used to think that
way, too. In my days of ignorance, I would not cross
the street with a free ticket to see the rortiest villain that
ever thundered, ‘ Foiled again ! ’ and I once travelled 100
miles to see the ‘ Private Secretary.’ It was the saddest
night of my life, until I saw ‘ Charley’s Aunt.’ I was con-
tinually going to see funny plays and coming away sad. I
thought life had no more joy for me, until one night I
saw a melodrama, by accident. I went into a theatre
before the show to talk to an actor about lending him a
fiver, or some such trifle. He said, * Don’t go now ; wait
till the first act is over, and we’ll have a drink.’ I
waited and it was the turning-point in my life. The
show was a play in three shrieks by the heroine, 15
struggles by the hero, and 47 attitudes by the entire cast.
The biggest attitudes were by the actor-manager, who
played the hero and kissed the leading lady fair in the
middle of the rosy mouth at every possible chance. He
was suspected, on most unreliable evidence, of having
followed Andree per cab and stolen the North Pole from
him, but there were Documents proving that Andr6e had
been seen playing polo with the Pole and had afterwards
made away with it by a stolen or forged Deed. Now, an
agent for a cigarette-factory, dressed in a slouch hat,
a forbidding smile, and with one front tooth out, had the
Documents concealed in the boiler of a steamer, and a
French convict in New Caledonia had seen the Pole in
Fitzs’ circus. By way of getting the Papers back the hero
struggled frequently with the cigarette agent, and said,
‘ Curse you ! ’ several times, but being unable to establish
his innocence this way, he got on a ship that was going to
he wrecked in t.hp track of another ship, which would
pick him up and take him to the penal island. By a most
natural course of events, he found the cigarette man on
board, and also the heroine, whom he kissed passionately
behind the funnel. I mean he took her behind the funnel so
as no one could see him but the audience, passengers, and
crew. Being denounced by the cigarette man, he is lett
on the - island, and by way of passing time, he gets
himself taken to the cell of the convict who saw
the Pole in the circus. He was removed there by
the governor of the gaol and three soldiers. The
convict’s original conversational gait was Irish tem-
pered by American, and his black-whisker stubble of
three-weeks’ growth, coupled with his three dialects,
makes him a fearful object. He will not confess, but coin
temptuously puffs cigarette smoke at them and says, Oi
will naught till ze zentleman anny ting.’ Then the hero
struggles with the convict, and says : ‘ I’ll sell me life to
the last drop of blood.’ Hearing this, the three
soldiers run away and have a smoke in the back-yard.
There being no referee to call them off the hero and
convict break away without a fall and the hero struggles
with the governor, jams him in one corner, and runs out.
As the door of the cell only sags open about 6in. and is not
locked, the gov. can’t get out, though he might do so by
pushing the door, but he hammers on the opposite wall
for help. The hero now has a terrific stniggle with the
soldiers who wait outside, and lay down their guns for that
purpose. He backheels them, gives them the Hying mare
and other fancy strokes, but is finally overpowered
and sentenced to death by the soldiers, who prop
him up against a wall and take careful aim with their
guns. In the meanwhile the heroine is on the boat
taking a walk around the funnel with a Yankee who has
just lost several marked £lO notes at draw-poker. This
proves the hero’s innocence, so she dashes off to New
Caledonia and comes in just as the soldiers are going to
fire. She waves a paper crying : “ Reprieve, reprieve .
The soldiers, who seem to run New Caledonia as they
like, discharge the prisoner at once without looking at
the paper, which might be the wash-bill. Trie hero kisses
the girl just on the spot where he knows by experience it
will do her most good ; and the cigarette agent is hand-
cuffed, while a scornful smile curls his lip, through which
his perished tooth gleams like a black speck on a bad
oyster. 1 left the theatre thinking what a fool I had been
—wasting 20 years digging the mullock of comedy for
laughs, while a gold-mine of melo-dramatic humor lay
unheeded at mv feet.

LIVER AILMENTS YERSUS KIDNEY DISEASE

Don’t Blame your Kidneys for your Liver’s Transgressions.
The Ca«e of
«S RS. EMILY GATELY.
( Reported for the “ Advocate.”)
Leaving Rockdale and the ocean front,
and mounting the risiugground,back from the
?ea, the traveller passes through Bexley, and
ollowing the ridge along the Stoney Creek
toad, he comes to open ground of green
elvet turf ranged with gracious trees. This
ittle beauty spot is well named “ Alston
ark,” and it was here that our reporter
ound the cottage of Mr. Gateiy, stone-
mason. Mrs. Gateiy wasathoine, surronnded
vith her fine family of sturdy children,
id in answer to enquiry, kindly consented
-> relate the details of her time of suffer-
■g, and the manner of her spee iy relief and
ecovery : —“ I can assure you 1 was very
ad indeed. It was at a time when I had a
;reat deal of extra work to do, and w'as
much worried in many ways ; besides, I had
lad influenza, and never got really well of it.
I was told that the influenza had left a lung
.veakness, and by advice I painted the
lollows in my shoulders, where I used to
offer extreme pain, with iodine. This
reatment was very painful, and, so far as I
ould tell, did me no good at all. And be-
ides the chest pains I had other distressing
symptoms that, coming quickly one after the
other, made my life unendurable.”
“ Will you tell me how you were affected?”
asked the reporter.
“ My kidneys were in a bad state, for I
had agonising pains across the loins, and
there was a duU pain under the shoulders.
(Here Mrs. Gateiy makes the same mistakes
as many other sufferers from liver oom-
plaint. The liver has many functions to
perform, and when afflicted the kidneys are
disturbed in sympathy. The water becomes
hot and discoloured, and every sufferer
jumps to the conclusion he has kidney
disease. Nothing of the sort. Kidney
disease has very little means of showing its
presence, and a man may beafflicted for years
and never know it. Backache, headache,
pains in the arms, chest, loins, back, shoulders,
| &c., are invariably due to liver complaint, not
kidney disease. To treat the kidneys is abso-
lutely useless ; curetheliverandthesupposed
kidney symptoms cease. —Ed.) It seemed as
though a heavy weight was on my chest,
giving me a stilled feeling, and lower down
I had a pain in the side under the ribs that
prevented me sleeping, or lying down, except
on one side of my body. My sight was a great
trouble to me, for neuralgia pains spread
over my head and forehead and settled at
the back of my eyes. I made sure I was
going blind. I could not endure strong
light, it actually pained me, and I fixed up
curtains when I could about the house to
keep it out. My rest was troubled at night,
and hour after hour I lay in bed unable to
close my eyes. At times my breathing was
aftected, and it pained me to draw a long
breath. I became that weak and low I
could not put one leg before the other, or
raise my hands above my head My body
was in a constant tremble, for I know that
my nervous system was quite run down,
affecting even my mind, so that I was
melancholy and fearful, often for no cause at
ail. My appetite became very poor, and
what I did eat did no good ; I seemed to be
losing the taste for food. And there is one
curious thing with me—l could never drink
plain water, it makes me sick, so that in the
hot weather I was always running to the
teapot, making tea six or seven times a day.
And I have thought often enough that
taking so much lea must be bad; the
difficulty is to find another drink that will
take its place. When I got very bad I told
my husband I should have to lie up, I was
so utterly wearied out with pain and weak-
ness.”
‘‘Well, did you lie up, Mrs. Gately?”
“No; as it happened, about that time
a man came this way distributing the books
that tell of Clements Tonic and the wonder-
ful cures it has done. One of my children
picked up one these books and brought it
home, and I was quite surprised when I
came to read the testimonials to find cases
mentioned just like my own. It was as
though I had written them myself, describ-
ing all my pains and distressing symptoms
just as I suffered. That made me think that
Clements Tonic must be the medicine for my
case, and would surely cure me as it had
others. So I told my husband that when he
came home from town again he was to
bring me a bottle.”
‘ And were your hopes justified ? ” asked
the reporter.
.“Yes; that first bottle did me a great
deal of good. Clements Tonic will go to
every part &nd nerve of your body, and
repair whatever is wrong. I know this is so,
for it has cured me. I continued with
Clements Tonic, and the remit was just what I
had read about as happening in other cases.
All my many troubles yielded and melted
away before Clements Tonic ; the pains in
my loins, chest, and head, the neuralgia
Bains in mv forehead and eyes diminished i
till I felt them no more. My appetite
returned, and I was always anxious for meal
time to ccme round. And it was Clements
Tonic that did all this for me, for I took iu
other remedy. It quickly brought me bad.
my old health and strength, and I was abb
to work again."
“ Have you any objection to your expei i
ence being made public ?”
“No,” said Mrs. Gately, “you are very
welcome to make it known in any way y< i
think best; perhaps what I say will guid-
others, as what others said guided me. am'
they may find relief, even when at the las
extremity, by taking Clements Tonic."

Crick and the Cables.
N.S. W. Postmaster Crick on the Pacific Cable—
If they could get [from the Eastern Extension mono-
poly] a tariff ensuring 4s. per word, with a s iding scale
which during the next few years would bring it down to
2s. 6d., they would be simply mad if they did not accept
such a proposal.
If! But they can get nothing of the sort. The
reduction to 2s. (id. depends on the cable revenue
keeping up to an average of £350,000 for three
consecutive years. If the average is killed for one
year in three, there’s no reduction. Further, the
cable revenue has fallen heavily since the Westra-
lian boom died. In 1899, it was not £350,000,
with a rate of 4s. 9d. per word. Will it be
£350,000 with a rate of 4s. ? There’s small hope
of it. And it will certainly not, for a long time,
be £350,000 with a rate of 3s. 6d. The 2s. fid. (!)
rate is moonshine —a trap to catch the unwary.
More Crick —
It had been said that if they accepted the reduced rates
it might be quite possible that the Pacific cable would be
endangered, but if the Pacific cable could not stand in
fair competition with a private cable, then he did not see
why the Pacific cable should not go to the wall.
That is what Mr. Crick does with his own Post-
office, of course. He allows private individuals
to contract to carry letters, and transmit tele-
grams, and establish rival telephone services. Or,
if he doesn’t, why doesn’t he? Further, Crick,
as the mouthpiece of Private Monopoly—
To tell him that the Government cable, which was sup-
ported by Canada, England and Australasia, having the
Government business as a monopoly, with a start into the
bargain, and with a lot of private business, could not
compete with a private firm, was to tell him something
which common-sense would not accept.
Then let Crick permit private individuals to com-
pete with his Post-office, and see where lie will
land. Possibly a Govt, cable could compete with
a private cable. But a Govt, cable which starts
by bringing the rate down from 4s. 9d. to 3s. per
word does enough to justify itself without per-
mitting a private concern to undercut it and sub-
contract away its profits. The Govts, concerned
are going to run the Pacific cable for the profit of
the peoples concerned. There is no sense in giving
the existing monopoly one half-penny of profit
which it is possible to secure for the Govt, cable.
And the present Pacific arrangement is a com-
promise between diverse interests, readied after
long tergiversation. If Postmaster Crick is going
to alter the basis of arrangement to please the
Eastern Extension Co., then the arrangement
falls. Canada will stand out. Possibly Britain
will stand out. The Pacific cable will be shelved
for a long time —which is precisely what the
Eastern Extension Co. wants—per its N.S.W.
mouthpieces.
The irrepressible Dr. Creed, of Sydney,
wants the Boar prisoners lagged to Australia.
“ A movement has been started in Ade-
laide to form an Australian Gentlemen’s Corps for
service in South Africa.” Now w.iat is the dis-
tinguishing mark of the Australian Gentleman ?
Is it that he says “ Haw ! ” The person who was
so idiotic as to talk about an “ Australian Gentle-
men’s Corps ” no doubt says “ Hee-haw.”
Australia is apparently in for a bad time.
In addition to the bubonic plague and the Absent-
minded Beggar, the whole of the basketware of
Sydney and Melbourne is found to be infested
with minute vermin that once introduced into the
system breed hydatids. Against this small loath-
some insect boiling water is powerless—the hotter
the water the more gay and festive does the small
object become. It is also said that to him strong
carbolic is as old wine to the seasoned bibber, and
nothing can prevail against him but mercury and
fire. At the railway workshops at Eveleigh 500
baskets have been destroyed by order of the health
authorities ; and in some cases men who have been
in the habit of carrying their fond in baskets have
been afflicted with hydatids and died. When full-
grown the insects are black and as large as a pin-
head ; but if a basket is bumped heavily on a sheet
of paper and the paper swept with a magnifying-
glass they will be found in numbers, though quite
colorless and invisible to the naked eye. All
people who have baskets are hereby abjured to
make a careful inspection thereof, or else burn
them on suspicion.
Once more the ineffectiveness of bombard-
ment has been shown—at Ladysmith. 12,000
shells had been thrown into the place, killing 35
and wounding 188 men—223 in all. That is, it
took 54 shells to hit one man. Which goes to
prove how thoroughly right Wellington was in
always refusing, during the Peninsular War, to
allow towns held by the French to be bombarded.
He said it would not hurt the French garrisons.
It shows too, that present-day artillery is not
more powerful than that of 90 years ago, except in
range. When you go into figures and look at it as
a matter of mathematical fact, stripped of epithets
and surplus adjectives, Roberts’s victory over
Cronje seems a ridiculously small affair. The
cabled reports show that Cronje took post in a
hollow two miles long, 150 yards wide and 50 feet
deep, 110 acres in area, part of a river-bed. He
was bombarded for 9 days continuously with 60 or
70 cannon and at last surrendered with 4300 men,
having had 50 killed, and 170 wounded, making
220 casualties, or 5 per cent, of his original
number in all. Each big gun must have
fired about 100 shells of sorts a day, and
they must all have gone into the river-bed—it was
too big to miss. That would amount to 50 shells
an acre for the nine days, and 25 shells for every
man hit. Which gives one a lively idea of the
real effect of artillery practice. It’s an old story
to artillerymen. The boom of the big guns and
the scream of shells overhead are very terrifying,
but they do marvellously little harm except in a
town, where they set fire to houses or knock them
into heaps of ruin. In ’7O, at Strasburg, the
German bombardment burned the splendid
library, shattered the cathedral spire, and ruined
numbers of houses, but did no damage to the
fortifications, and injured few people. Koodoos-
rand has had one good result in exploding the
lyddite myth. Lyddite shells were freely used,
and if they had had the deadly, suffocating effect
attributed to them, they had a fair chance in that
hollow to show it, but they didn’t—which ap-
parently disposes of another military bogey. War
is becoming unintentionally humane. The inven-
tors are constantly turning out new devices for
killing, which won’t kill anyone who does not put
himself into the precise position to be killed.
One horror is over, anyhow—Buller can
hardly cross the Tugela any more. That constant
crossing of the Tugela seemed at one time as if it
must end in Buller getting his feet wet.
“The Mayor of Albury has cabled to
London : —‘ Alhurv, the proposed Federal city,
overjoyed at the success of the British troops.’ ”
Another shiny-billy advt. pasted on the Throne.
Sydney Drs. Tidswell and Dick suggest
that the bubonic plague is about as old as rye
whisky. They also suggest that the Biblical
“ emerods,” of which the Philistines made golden
images about 1141 b.c., were the groin-lumps of
the plague.
“Tinii ” : Yes, let the N.S.W. Bushmen
who have gone to South Africa be called “The
Clancys ! ” And the third contingent made up
chiefly of the Bushies left behind will naturally be
“The Glancys of the Overflow.”
Sydney Inspector of Police (trying to get
a comfortable snooze while out on a cold and
inclement fishing-trip): “If it was at home in me
good bed I was it isn’t out here perishing I’d be
to-night.”
The writer of “Echoes” for Adelaide
Observer cheerfully suggests that President
Kruger, when captured, shall be kept in life-long
confinement somewhere. Several other writers in
this blood-drunken country have made the same
suggestion.
One of the most humorous incidents of
the Transvaal war is Sydney D.T.’s solemn pro-
nouncement concerning Cronje (while he was still
burrowing in the river-bed):
Well aware of the hopelessness of his position it would
surely be wiser—it would certainly appear to be his higher
duty as a Christian—to surrender.
A Bulletin correspondent wants to know
what was done by the Sydney health authorities
with the ambulance employed in carrying the un-
fortunate Dudley (alleged to have died from
plague) from his place m Sussex-street, Sydney,
to his house in Drummoyne, between the time of
Dudley’s seizure on the Wednesday afternoon,
21st Feb., and the following Saturday morning?
Premier Lyne, talking loosely and largely
as usual, declares that N.S.W. has 200,000 avail-
able fighting-men. But, thanks to the authori-
ties, she cannot decently arm 10,000 of them.
Anyway, we don’t want to turn this population
into soldiers except in the gravest need of self-
defence. The worst use to which you can put a
man is to hang him. The next worst is to make a
soldier of him, and hire him out as a mercenary
murderer —even at ss. a day, which is nearly twice
as much as he can get as an ordinary station-
hand.
Cabled that an official inquiry shows that
the police sergeant who misled Gatacre at
Stormberg simply blundered ; also, that this
sergeant bore a very good reputation. In view of
which it will be interesting to watch the inevit-
able inquiry into the published statement that
“ when the general saw the position the guide had
taken him into, he shot the fellow dead with his
own revolver.” Altogether, in fact, Gatacre seems
likely to have a warmer time presently than even
Methuen.
The kilt, although a splendid thing to
impress women with at reviews, is a ghastly fraud
as a modern fighting dress. At Magersfontein
the Hielan’men had to lie flat on their faces all
day in the broiling sun till darkness made it
possible for them to retreat. The heat of the sun
was terrific, and lying on the sandy soil the poor
fellows’ legs were slowly roasted, and the muscles
twisted up to such an extent that (so the London
papers declare) permanent lameness is the result
in many cases. The glory of a Hielau’man is that
bare patch between the bottom of the kilt and the
top of tiie hose. But where there are no women
to admire the bare spot it might as well be covered
up, if only to keep the mosquitoes off.
There seems to be something very queer
about the N.S. W. Govt.’s action in rc the Pacific
cable. Victoria has been wavering, and is now
announced as inclined to support a continuance of
the Eastern Extension monopoly—thanks partly,
it is said, to strong representations from the Lyne
Govt. And it was given out in Sydney recently
that Chamberlain supported the E.E. Co.’s cable
scheme. The fact is that he cabled opposing it ;
but it was not until his cable was published in
Melbourne that the Lyne Govt, permitted the
fact to be known in Sydney. Acceptance of the
E.E. Co.’s offer, according to the local Canadian
commissioner, means the withdrawal of Canada
from the Pacific scheme—seeing that the Canadian
calculations do not reckon on the loss which is
meant by playing into the hand of the present
monoply. What is the Lyne Govt.’s little game ?
This is the story of Thomas Knifeton who
rushed into Long Gully Police Station (Bendigo)
with small buckets of perspiration streaming off
him, trembling with excitement and speaking in
short gaspy barks. When he had barked for
several minutes the startled man in blue grasped
the fact that some one had been murdered. “ But
who is murdered?” asked the constable. “My
wife ! A neighbor named Blank and his wife did
for her by bashing her over the head with a billet
of wood. They’d have murdered me too if I
hadn’t cleared. I heard them talking outside the
house at 1 o’clock this morning plotting how to
settle us. They think that I have money in the j
house.” So the man in blue girded on hisshooting-
iron and ran his hardest across the ridges to the
scene of the tragedy. When they reached the
house the place seemed strangely quiet and devoid
of bloodstains, and the constable asked where
the murderers had been last seen. Thos.
pointed to a shed and remarked, “They’re in
there now, can’t you hear ’em talking ? ” The
avenger of blood strained his ears but could hear
nothing, so he asked Thos. to show him the body
and Thos. opened the door cautiously and entered
the kitchen in a grave and decorous manner with
the policeman close behind. As soon as he got
inside he saw Mrs. Knifeton frying bacon and
eggs. Thomas seemed to be astounded and com-
menced to caress her and spill the bacon on to the
fire, but the lady would have none of him, and
declared that lie was “in the horrors.” True
enough, the tragedy was only another version of
“got ’em again.” Thos. is better now.
Despite drought, Mildura, the Murray
irrigation settlement, flourishes. This season
Zante currants form, for the first time, a most
important part of the crop. One settler has just
gathered ISi tons from 20 acres.
Melbourne debt-collectors have for long
past indulged in the cheerful practice of stamping
the word “ debt ” in big black letters upon the en-
velopes of their posted billets.dour. A depu-
tation of sufferers interviewed P.M.G. Watt,
who ordered the non-delivery of all such letters.
The cost of 11. H. Lusk’s N.S.W. School
History of Australia up to and including the final
“revise” is estimated at £l4OO. The author got
£450; those who tinkered the MS., adding and
re-editing, compressing and expanding, got as
much more. Before Minister Hogue left office
the cost was just on £lOOO, and since then it has
been edited and re-edited once more. Minister
Perry now finally revises and is determined to
publish it. Apart from the Government printers
share of expense, the MS. may be said to have
cost considerably over £lOOO.
Wise, Q.C., and Want are engaged in a
big forensic duel in the Kugelmann-Norton libel
case, which is about the longest on record in
N.S.W. Evidence having concluded last week,
counsel’s addresses and the Judge’s summing
up will probably occupy most of this week.
Altogether it has been a fine time for the lawyers
engaged, and fees on both sides have been osten-
tatiously paid every morning. The jury get some
30s. a day from the Crown and the parties, so they
have had a fairly decent job.
The cheap and natty scheme for taking a
large part of Sydney' Domain for a new railway
station will, if carried out, involve the destruction
of over 200 trees, to say nothing of the fact that
as Sydney grows, and the station requires exten-
sion, other trees and other great slices of the
people's pleasure-ground must go. What with
the proposal to steal part of the Domain for a
railway and some more for wharves, the splendid
public property is likely to vanish very fast. And
the Domain railway idea is imbecile as well as
cheap. Sooner or later the line must be carried
across the harbor, and to get across the harbor it
needs to keep along the west side of George-strcet
so as to reach the narrow place at Miller’s Point—
the only place where a bridge can be built
reasonably cheap. The money that can be saved
by stealing the Domain now will be all lost later
on in the extra expense of getting across the
harbor.
It has recently leaked out that, not only
Mr. Arthur Chamberlain and the immediate mem-
bers of his family, but also about a dozen other
families, connections of theirs by marriage, are
deeply interested in important industries affected
by the operations of the Transvaal Government.
For instance, the above-named gentleman, a
brother of the Secretary of State foi the Colonies,
and managing director of the lvynoeh Dynamite
Co., held in that concern in Aug., ’!)7, 222!> £lO
shares, which a year later had increased to 3310.
At the latter date eight other male and female
members of the Chamberlain family each pos-
sessed between 200 and 750 shares in the same co.
Now, strenuous efforts were made by Mr. Joseph
Chamberlain in 1808 to induce the Transvaal to
relinquish its dynamite monopoly ; and while it
is of course utterly unlikely that a man of Mr.
Chamberlain’s official status and personal character
would be consciously influenced by sordid con-
siderations while conducting, on behalf of his
country, diplomatic communications leading up to
war, it must be admitted that in this matter he
occupies a most unfortunate position.
Just now the bogey of Sydney Board of
Health is Rats. According to the President
of the Board all the rats in Sydney are dying
of the plague ; nevertheless he wants them killed
off a little faster. But, even if the local rats could
be exterminated thousands of them would die
hidden away in holes and corners, and then insect
scavengers would feed on their remains and there-
after merrily spread the infection. Then there is
the domestic puss which, after killing an infected
rat or two, would come purring round the kids
and communicate the infection to them. Same
with Snap, the terrier, and the upshot of it all
would lie that the war of extermination now
declared against rats would have to be extended
to every carnivorous living thing, and to the fleas,
flies, and mosquitoes. Which would be a hopeless
undertaking. But “science,” as represented by
the Board, is ready to tackle the impossible.
The following protest was recently re-
ceived by Lord Roberts :
Bloemfontein. February 3.
We learn from many sides that the British troops, con-
trary to tiie recognised usages of war, are guilty of the
destruction by burning and blowing up with dynamite of
farmhouses, of the devastation of farms and the goods
therein, whereby unprotected women and children are
deprived of food and cover.
This happens not only where barbarians are encouraged
by British officers, but even in the Cape Colony and in
this State, where white brigands come out from the
theatre of war with the evident intention of carrying out
a general devastation, without any reason recognised by
the custom of war, and without in any way furthering the
operations.
We wish earnestly to protest against such acts.
(Signed) President Z. A. R.
President O KS.
In reply, General Roberts states that in no
instance has such a charge been substantiated,
and adds that, as he wishes to conduct the war as
humanely as possible, he would rigorously punish
any needless barbarity. But the Boer statements
are backed up, as far as we in Australia are con-
cerned, by the “letters from the front” which
have recently been swarming in the daily and
country press, and in which some of our local
swashies, writing under their own names, have
actually revelled in describing how they and their
companions wrecked furniture and destroyed
houses; also, they boasted of such unspeakably
brutal acts as, for instance, the knocking out of

the consequences to the perpetrators might be ex-

SOAP
Has invariably been awarded the Highest Distinction at
the disposal of the Judges.
The Testimony of Eminent Analytical
Chemists:
From Dr. REDWOOD, Fk.D.,
F.1.C., F.C.S., &c.,
Late Professor of Chemistry nnd Pharmacy to the
pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
“My analytical and practical experience
of Pears’ Snap now extends over a very
lengthened period—nearlyf)oyears—during
which time I have never come across
another toilet soap which so closely realises
my ideal of perfection ; its purity is such
that it maybe used with perfect confidence
u|ion the tenderest and most sensitive skin
—even that of a new-born babe.”
CHAS. R. C. TICHBORNE, Esq.,
LXa.D., F.1.C., F.C.S.,
Lecturer oa Chemistry at Carmichael College of
Medicine, Lublin, and Chemist to the Apothe-
caries’ Hall of Ireland.
“I have made three separate and in-
dependent analyses of Pears’ Soap, obtain-
ing the samples myself at the ordinary
retail shops, and from these examinations
lam enabled to certify to its purity. It is
made in a most perfect manner, and is free
from any causticity—to persons of delicate
skin a question of vital importance. Being 1
free from all adulteration with water its
durability is really remarkable. I cannot
speak too highly of it, for it strikingly
illustrates the perfection of toilet soap.”
STEVENSON McABAM, Esc*.,
Ph.D., &c. f
lecturer on Chemistry, Surgeon*’ Hall,
Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have made careful analyses of Pears’
Soap, which I have obtained indiscrimi-
nately at different shops in Edinburgh,
and I can certify to its being a pure and
genuine soap, free from admixture with
any foreign substances, and practically
devoid of causticity. It combines detergent
with emollient properties in a high degree,
and it may therefore he used with great
advantage fur toilet and bath purposes,
especially in the case of children and others
whose skin is soft and delicate, and liable
to be affected by the impure and caustic
nature of ordinary soap."
Virtue Rejoices in Temptation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a little wooden church built in a thriving
mining township. He was the incumbent thereof,
and She was a member of liis congregation. It
had not been a very thriving church until lie took
charge of the careless souls of its attendants, and
She entered heartily into helping him. After that
it went ahead, and He prospered with it.
He was a smooth-faced boyish-looking fellow,
and a bachelor whose avocation in life so pleased
his female relatives that their laudations led him
to consider himself but a degree lower than the
Deity he professed to serve. He believed that a
spirit of righteousness prompted him to shake the
hard hands of the miners, and evince sympathy in
them and theirs.
She was a squatter’s daughter who had married
the bank manager, and she had been a beauty of
the bush. She helped the parson because—being
childless and socially superior to her human envir-
onments—no other outlet for her energies was
open to her. The hank manager was her reverse
in disposition, an easy-going, good-natured rod-
faced individual who unthinkingly gave his wife
plenty of rein. She was a woman who needed
much.
For eighteen months lie and She worked amic-
ably together until one day ho discovered in the
face of his mirror that in addition to his moral
excellence he possessed a great physical beauty.
His hair was thick and waved gracefully above
his temples; his eyes were blue and beautiful;
his complexion unspoilt by wind and weather ;
and his hands white, soft and admirably shaped.
As he gazed on the reflection of Perfection, he
suddenly realised why she helped him. Why she,
a beautiful, intelligent woman, gave time and
brains to building up a career for him. He was
the magnet that drew her into Christian work.
Conscious of his'own integrity, he pitied her and
forbore to blame her, knowing full well the bank-
manager could lie no congenial companion for a
woman of her attractions and attainments.
For three days he, pitying her, kept out of her
way, and did not visit the bank-manager’s resi-
dence for counsel and sympathy. Then a lad in a
recently-opened mine was injured and taken to
the mine-manager’s miserable dwelling. 110
saddled up at once and rode away. Bhe was
before him soothing the wounded lad and giving
directions generally. Self in the man came upper-
most. He remembered the man the mirror had
revealed to him.
Her face was the dead white of a lily, but the
veil of sadness was lifted from it as her eyes met
his. She bent over the wounded lad and whis-
pered something, and in reply he stretched out a
bare, brawny arm and attempted a smile. The
simple effort pained him, and the smile ended in
facial distortion.
“ He is frightened,” she whispered, with quiver-
ing lips. “ Pray—l cannot.”
Involuntarily he wondered if consciousness of
her weakness forbade her to solicit aid from above.
Ho knelt down and prayed fervently. She
wiped the death-damped brow. Even her un-
accustomed eyes know death was nigh.
When the end had come she lifted her white
face and begged him to take her home. Bhe had
walked to the mine manager’s hut. Returning
homewards he led his horse and walked at her
side. Uninvited, she took his arm.
“Death is so dreadful —I have met it so
seldom,” she whispered.
His heart beat chokingly. Were Fate and Satan
undoing the self-sacrifice of the last few days in
throwing her across his path, so that, unless he
trod her woman’s heart in the mud of humiliation,
lie must take her in his arms and shield her—and,
merciful Heaven ! wreck his own promising
career? He let his arm fall slack; so slack that
even she, absorbed in recent events, felt it, and
roused herself.
“Poor fellow,” she said, softly and soothingly.
“You, too, feel the shock.”
He let the hand drop from his arm.
It was time to “grasp his nettle” and face the
temptress. He was strong in his own sane tit}'.
“ Marion ! ”
The name that for years she had only heard from
the lips of the red-faced bank manager failed to
startle her. The vision of the dead lad and the
passing away of life still entranced her ensos.
“My career—l have a Christian mother —I—”
Her eyes questioned him.
“ Your husband—my career—as a clergyman,”
he went on disjointedly.
II is eyes fell to the ground. She lowered her
head until her eyes met his. Then instinctively
she felt what he felt.
“ You imagine because T, in my strength, sought
to lift you, poor weakling, from utter obscurity
that 1 forgot the existence of my dear old devil-
may-care Tom—that I think more of you than of
him 1 ” The pallor of her face gave wav to a flush
of deep angry crimson ; her gaze as it concen-
trated on Ins flinching face scorched into his soul.
Bho thought of days gone by when for an in-
sulting remark she had heard addressed to a black
gin she horsewhipped a stock-rider. Was the
craven heart before her worthy a better treatment
because of his cloth ! He held a light whip in his
right hand. In a tick of her dainty watch it was
firmly grasped in her strong white fingers and laid
alwut his trembling shoulders. Again and again
it was lifted and fell, until bent and broken she
flung it as a reptile from her.
That night the bank-manager was surprised at
the question : “If a woman of my years helped
you when you were younger, would you have be-
lieved her in love with you ?”
“ Ask mo something easy,” he saidd good-
humoredly.
L.B.H.
The Chinese question : “ Whaffor ?”
A traveller from India, now in Tasmania,
points out that in the former country there is a
splendid market for Australian wines of the hock
and chablis class, though he says the inferiority of
Australian red wines is damaging their sale in the
same quarter. He also mentions that in Australian
hotels he has paid,, for a pint of Australian claret,
as much as 2/0, (at which figure he could have ob-
tained much better French claret) and very justly
comments that in the case of such a young in-
dustry as Australian wine-making this kind of
extortion is suicidal.
Dogs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Most travellers like a dog,” said Tarkalson,
“an’ a traveller’s dog is mostly good for one
thing. That’s his element. Take him out of that
an’ lie’s worthless. Some dogs aro always worth-
less. They’re born that way, an’ if they lived for
50 years they wouldn’t get an}' worthier. They’re
tolerated for their company. Others are only good
for catchin’ blowflies. Let a fly buzz near one of
’em, an’ you’ll see him look up an’ growl. If it’s
flyin’ about, he’ll spring after it an’ bark at it; if
it’s on a blade of grass, he’ll snoak on to’t, waggin’
his tail, like another dog would after a rabbit.
When he does catch it, the way he chaws it an’
shakes it—you’d think he was aworryin’ a 7ft.
goanna or a boy-constructor.”
Went shootin’ with one of ’em once, thinkin’
I’d leani him to hunt, lie went off on a scent all
right, an’ by-an’-bye I hears him bark. Climbs
half-a-mile over two rough stony ridges, an’ finds
him sittin’ under a saplin’. Moon’s round it a bit,
an’ was givin’ it up, when out darts —from 40ft.
up, mind yer—a blow-fly ! An’ away goes that
dog after it barkin’ like mad. I’d a shot him, but
I recollected just then that it was his element.
* * * *
Now, Phil Smith, of Connulpio, had a real
clinker for fetchin’ up a sheep. When Phil
wanted mutton he’d just go out with a bag and a
telescope. Soon’s he spotted a mob he’d send the
dog off to get one. Then he’d stand there boldin’
the mouth of the bag open. The dog would cut off
one an’ work him up, steady like, gradually closer
an’ closer, dodgin’ this way an’ that way, till at last
he’d put him fair into that bag.
He was the only dog I ever saw as could do that,
though I’ve seen many a one as would muster a
cattle paddock, an’ draft out the strangers before
puttin’ ’em in the yard.
Old Rover, that was on Wooroowoolgen a few
years ago, was ono. Useter fetch up the
milkers ov’ry evenin’, out of a big paddock, too ;
an’ you’d see him, when he got close to the yard,
go quietly in among ’em an’ draft out the dry
cows, bullocks, an’ weaners.
He was very undecided about the bull for a long
time, an’ it was only after he’d been charged
several times that he let him pass. But Rover
still had his doubts about him bein’ a milker, lie
was miserable ; seemed to bo brooding over it, in
fact.
Bo one mornin’ he goes over to the yard, an’
sits at the bails an’ sees ev’ry cow milked. When
lie saw the bull wasn’t milked, ho looked at him
with the expression of a friond whose confidence
had been betrayed, then slouched away with the
most indignant expression I ever saw on a dog’s
face.
He watched again next mornin’, an’ when the
bull wasn’t milked, he heeled him to the furthest
end of the paddock.

You’ve heard tell of Thackaringa Billy’s slut ?
They know her all over the back country. She
was a wonder. At times she was Billy’s only hand
on the road with cattle, an’ she’d look after her
side, drivin* off strangors, an’camp ’em at lunch-
time an’ night-time, ivs well as the best of drovers.
Bho knew the regulation half-mile spread, too, as
well as a man.
Bhe did her watch at night, too, sometimes
perched on the saddle, the reins in her mouth, an’
the old night ’orse inoochin’ slowlv round. If they
rushed she’d jump off, an”tween her an’ the moke
they’d head an’ ring any mob as ever ran through
mulga.

Out Wanaaring way I was once trapped by a
teamster’s dog. The brute would let anyone go to
the waggon, an’ do what he liked there; but he’d
never let a soul leave it. ’Twas his element.
I got there early, had a feed an’ a good spell,
then reckoned I'd push on. But the dog had
Fossession of my swag, an’ he stood up an’growled.
walked away a bit thinkin’ he’d shift. He did.
He put me back to the waggon an’ kep’ me there.
’Bout sundown the teamster turns up. “Good
evenin’,” he says—“traveilin’?” An’ he looked
at my swag an’ smiled. “No,” I said, “that’s
the traveller under the waggon. I’m the dog.”

As a climber few dogs could lick Stumpy, of
Whittabranah. He’d walk the ridge-oappin’ of a
’ouse, trot round on the water-spout, an’ slide
down the pipin’. He’d do that jes’ for exercise.
When he was after a cat his climbin’ was some-
thing to look at. He’d a mortal set on cats. Saw
him one day climb 12 foot up a mulga and wricgle
out along a small limb that ’ad a cat on the end of
it. The limb broke, an’, as Stumpy was heavier
than the cat, he fell faster, an’ passin’ it he grabbed
it in his mouth, an’ was snakin’ it when he hit the
ground. He was a slashin’ climber, was Stumpy.
* * * *
But the daddy of ’em all b’longed to a carrier
named Cook. 'He was a born genius, that dog.
Use ter muster the bullocks of a mornin’, an’ stand
’em in their places, two an’ two, as Cook yoked
’em. Took ’em to water at sundown, an’, while
they’d be drinkin’, he’d hunt about for the best
grass. One day, Cook bought two spotted bul-
locks, an’ let ’em go with the rest. Next mornin’,
the dog was a bit long-winded turnin’ up, so
Cook rode out to see what was keepin’ him. Finds
him with the old bullocks rounded up on a flat. A
little wav off lie’ad four spotted ones—two Cook
»,ui bought, an’ two strangers. The dog didn’t
know which was which, bein’as yet only slightly
acquainted with the new-comers. He was satis-
fied about two, -for he drove one into the mob, an’
hunted the other—a stranger—into the bush.
The other two were very much alike, an’ Cook
reckoned he’d fetch both of ’em on. But, no.
That dog jes’ drives one over to a stump, makes
him stand close ag’in it, an’ then he jumps up an’
examines the brand ! An’ then he went off an*
looked at the receipt Cook got when he bought the
two spotted bullocks.
“ Studyin’ brands was that dog’s element.”

Pitiable, writes a "Bulletin correspondent,
to see the Russian Finns rushing all over Queens-
land to find a bit of land suitable for cultivation
and having either to abandon the search or take up
country leagues and leagues away from a railway
in districts where the settlers have to let their pro-
duce rot on account of the difficulty of finding a
market. And the Finns are just the men to settle
on land.

MR. RICHARD TRESISE.
Did you ever notice a man suddenly place his
hands on his hips ? Did you watch his face con-
tract with pain ? Do you know why he does it ?
Ask him about it. He will tell you it is the re-
sult of years of hard work—his back has given
out—would not stand the strain any longer. It
aches nearly all the time, with sudden twinges of
pain which make life miserable.
What have I done for it ? I have rubbed it with
liniments until my skin was nearly raw. I have
worn plasters for months at a time. No, lam too
old to be cured now.
Now, here is a case where age and experience
are wrong. We want to tell him where he is
wrong, to explain how the aches and pains in the
back come from disordered kidneys, and how, to
cure the back, you MUST CURE THE KID-
NEYS. We cannot do this in a better way than
by giving the experience of an old gentleman who
suffered with his back and kidneys for years, and
who has at last found relief.
The gentleman is Mr. Richard Tresise, and his
photograph is given above. He is 74 years old,
and is a resident of Daylesford, Victoria, living in
East-street. He has lived in Daylesford for 40
years, and is, of course, well known.
“ My sufferings covered a period of six years,”
said Mr. Tresise, “and consisted of severe pains
in my back, together with a form of kidney
trouble. My back was so bad that I could not
stoop over, except with difficulty, and it made me
very miserable indeed. This was only one of the
symptoms of kidney trouble, however, for the
kidney secretions showed me the kidneys were
diseased. In the first place I couldn’t sleep well
at night, as my kidneys interfered with my rest.
Then the kidney secretions were unnatural. This
condition went on for six years, as I said, and I
got no relief until I got Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. These pills proved to be just what I
needed, for their action was directly on my kid-
neys. They regulated their action, greatly re-
lieved my back, and I am much better since I
used them ; and this from a man of my age (74
years) is saying a good deal. You are at liberty
to publish this, as it is all true, and may help
ethers who suffer as I did.”—(Signed) Richard
Tiiesise.
When your kidneys are not doing their work, it
will be manifested by pain or dull ache in the
back, rheumatic pains, sciatica, sediment in the
urine, scanty supply, scalding irritation in passing
it, obliged to go often during the day and to get
up during the night, uric acid, sleeplessness, ner-
vousness, irritability, sallow unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, loss
of energy and ambition. If your water, when
allowed to remain undisturbed for twenty-four
hours, forms a sediment or settling, or has a cloudy
appearance, it is evidence that your kidneys and
bladder need immediate attention.
If you have any of the above symptoms, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will set you right and cure
you. We will gladly send you the names of thou-
sands who have testified to what Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills have done for them.
These pills do not act on the bowels, they act on
the kidneys, and deserve the serious attention of
any sufferer from this most dangerous disease.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS

Itching Piles.
DOAN’S OINTMENT CURES PILES PER-
MANENTLY BY CURING THE CAUSE.
A REMARKABLE REMEDY WHICH IS
BRINGING COMFORT TO THOUSANDS
OF SUFFERERS.
Probably half the people who see this article
suffer from piles. It is one of the commonest
diseases, and one of the most obstinate. People
have it for years, and just because it is not imme-
diately fatal they neglect it. Carelessness causes no
endof suffering. Carelessnessaboutsosimpleathing
as piles has often caused death. Hemorrhages occur
from no apparent cause, and loss of blood causes
death. Hemorrhages occur under surgical treat-
ment, often causing death.
Piles are simple in the beginning, and easily
cured. They can be cured even in the worst
stages, without pain or loss of blood, quickly,
surely, and completely. There is only one remedy
that will do it—DOAN’S OINTMENT.
It allays the inflammation immediately, heals
the irritated surface, and with continued treat-
ment, reduces the swelling and puts the mem-
branes into good, sound, healthy condition. The
cure is thorough and permanent. Here is a
case :
T. W. Hickson,-of No. 170 Cumberland-street,
this city, says :—“For a few weeks I was very
much inconvenienced by an attack of itching piles
from which I could get no relief. Doan’s Oint-
ment was first advertised at that time, and I
obtained a pot from Newman’s Pharmacy, in King
Street. lam glad to say that the piles completely
disappeared, after a short treatment with the
ointment, and I’ve not had occasion to use it since.
I will not forget to recommend Doan’s Ointment.”
Doan’s Ointment has been tested in so many
ways, in hospital work, in private practice, and
has proved so successful that a special arrange-
ment has been made by which all readers of The
Bulletin who have not already tried it may
obtain a sample pot free by mail who will send us
their names and addresses and a penny stamp to
pay postage. We know that this ointment will
cure these affections, that it will cure them abso-
lutely, and we want you to know it. It is per-
fectly unnecessary for anyone to suffer from Piles
or Eczema for one single moment. Doan’s Ointment
will cure them absolutely, but do not take our word
for it; send a penny stamp for a sample box. The
large size box is sold at 2s. fid. per box (six boxes
15s. 3d.). If you cannot obtain it locally from
your chemist or storekeeper, same will be posted
on receipt of price by the proprietors, Foster-
McClellan Co., 76 Pitt-street, Sydney.

When Pat Malone is Paid.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Pat Malone is paid
An extra pound or two
For working overtime,
Oh, what a pantomime
There is in Waterloo !
The sky is brilliant blue,
The whole world is arrayed
In bloom that cannot fade,
The bells of glory chime,
When Pat Malone is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid
He goes with gallant tread—
For Life is very fair,
And Joy is in the air
And Poverty is dead,
And bands play, in his head,
Gay tunes that might be played
At some mild masquerade,
And trumps of triumph blare,
When Pat Malone is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid
There comes the reign of Mirth ;
Black Care it flies away,
For ever and a day,
And gone is Drought and Dearth ;
A pound will buy the earth ;
And Pat goes on parade
Like his own statue made
By Sculptor Illingworth !
When Pat Malone is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid,
It always is his plan
To scour around the town
To buy his wife a gown.
’Tis then he meets with Dan,
A pleasant Galway man,
Quite easy to persuade
To drink success to trade,
And health to Mary Ann—
When Pat Malone is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid
His views are never mean,
And, over quarts of beer,
He states in accents clear,
The gown shall be of green
Silk lit to deck a queen—
And L>an, who give lus aid,
Suggests that golden braid,
Would much the costume cheer—
Wnen Pat Malone is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid
He’s cruel hard to pleaie,
For nothing is too tine
In texture or design.
For Molly’s draperies—
And taen the two Magees,
So handy with the spade,
Come in with Mick M'Quade,
And say what they opine —
When Pat Malono is paid.
When Pat Malone is paid,
A sausage, stowed within
A broken ornament,
Is all he can present
When home he lands with Flynn,
A friend disguised in gin.
Then out the pair are laid
By one in ambuscade,
So ends the merriment
When Pat Malone is paid.
VICTOR.
Clifton’s Mistake.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Clifton sat by the empty fireplace and tried to
realise it all. He had gone to his work as usual
that morning, and had returned as usual at night
—that much was clear. But after ? The silence
that puzzled him as he entered the house; the
unwashed breakfast things upon the table ; a chair
overturned, as by someone in a hurry; the ash-
choked fireplace; the unlighted lamps. His walk
through the silent, disordered house; his finding
her coarse, curt note, saying that she had gone—
and with that man, the man he had always
despised.
Clifton sat by the fireplace and thought. He
wondered if he was entirely blameless. He had
been careless towards her; perhaps her
woman’s heart would consider him cold, even
cruel. How was she to know that in his unde-
monstrative way he had loved her presence as
something bright and satisfying—something to be
always thankful for ? Perhaps she had misunder-
stood. At all events she was gone ; and he could
only hate her now. That was his duty. Clifton
rose, 'felt his way cautiously to the door, and
passed out into the night. It had turned cold and
wet, and no one was astir. Not caring where he
went, he turned aside from the lights of the town,
and hurried towards the outskirts anywhere.
He only wanted freedom—to breathe and to think.
Suddenly he realised where he was, and stopped.
Opposite was a house, and upon the lighted win-
dow-curtains he saw the silhouette of a woman.
He gazed at it fixedly, as if the picture called up a
memory. Then he smiled cynically in the dark-
ness. So she was at home, and alone—of course.
Her drunken brute of a husband was away in the
town, and possibly would not be home for days :
Clifton remembered having seen him lying in an
hotel as he was coming home to
This woman loved him; he had seen it a
hundred times in the past; she had tempted him
as a woman can, but he had resisted, and been
true to his wife. His wife! Again Clifton
smiled cynically. The silhouette disappeared
from the blind, and the door opened. Clifton saw
a woman outlined against the light behind her—a
little, tidy woman with the lamp-rays spraying
her hair with gold, and softening every curve of
her shapely figure. A thought of retaliation came
to him ; a longing for sympathy—and this woman
loved him. He strode forward hurriedly, lest the
door should be closed.
* * * *
The rain-drops were beating a merry march
upon the window-pane; and Clifton, sitting by
the fire, heard a hesitant knock at the door—a
knock so light that it seemed only a variation of
the refrain. He opened, and a woman entered.
A wet, forlorn-looking woman who sprinkled the
floor with a spattering shower as she cast the cloak
from her head and revealed the faoe of his wife.
She stood before him shivering with cold and fear,
and her eyes turned appealingly to his face.
Clifton silently closed the door and walked baok
to the fire.
“ So you have come back ! ” he said.
“Yes,” the woman said so softly that he scarcely
heard her.
“And why?” he said shortly, standing with
his back to the fire. She stood by the door in the
cold, and he did not invite her closer.
“ Because—because,” she stammered—" I could
not stay away from you. Here is my proper
place.”
“You remember that rather late,” he said
hardly. “ Where is— he ? ”
“Gone,” she said drearily; and as he did not
speak for seconds, she repeated, “Gone—gone.”
“ Tired of you already, eh ? What a valueless
thing you must be ! ”
She had stepped up closer to him, and he could
note her face plainly. Her cheeks were flushed,
and her eyes, brightening with anger, recalled
what she had been long ago.
“I left him,” she said, passionately. “Iwaa
mad when I left you, and I awoke to my madness.
I realised how wicked I was, and the injury I had
done you. I determined to return and beg for
forgiveness.”
Clifton watched her, smiling outwardly—in-
wardly wondering if he really hated her. She had
fallen upon her knees before him, and her clasped
hands were raised above her bosom.
“ You will forgive me ? ” she pleaded. “ Recall
what is past. Do you remember the night you
first saw me ? I was sitting by myself—l was so
very shy—and your eyes met mine, and I felt my
cheeks hot—l did not know why. And I turned
away, and pretended to watch them dancing,
though all the time I was longing to learn if you
were still looking at me. And then I knew you
were beside me, although I dared not raise my
eyes. And we danced together, and I spoke not
a word to you—l could not. And then after that
you saw me often, and I pretended to avoid you,
though in my heart I longed for your corning—do
you remember ? And I knew I loved you as you
loved me.”
Still Clifton watched her, silently. Once he
made a gesture as if to stop her. How well Ire
remembered. And now . . .
“ You loved me, then,” she proceeded. “Cannot
you believe that some good remains ? ”
“I would believe it if I could ”he said,
irresolutely.
“Oh ! you can,” she murmured. “You can.”
“ But you come too late,” he said.
“ Too late,” she repeated. “ See ! I can forgive.
I have heard of her —they were quick enough to
tell me—but that makes no difference. Only you
must not go near her again.”
The man raised a hand as if to silence her. He
had not forgotten that someone else was waiting
for him ; he had been making mental comparisons
and his heart was softening to the woman before
him. After all, this was the one he had loved,
and the love of quiet natures dies hard. Then . .
. . his coldness had helped her to her ruin. The
other had satisfied his revenge; had given him
sympathy when he craved it, but he had never
loved her.
“And knowing that, you can forget?” he
asked, not looking at her.
“lama woman,” she said, simply.
“ And, so that you take me from her, you can
forget the rest ? ” he said, with momentary cynic-
ism. She was silent.
“ Listen !” he said, bending down. “We have
both sinned; you the most, but that does not
excuse me. I am a man, and should have been
stronger. Let us both forget, and we will go away
and begin all over again.”
She was watching him eagerly, wistfully. But,
when he thought of it afterwards, he knew that he
had not understood the whole meaning of that
look. When he lifted her in his arms, he found
that she was sobbing, and he thought it was only
shame that made her turn her face away from him.
* * • *
Clifton went to his work next morning, deter-
mined to ignore the veiled sneers he knew awaited
him.
His wife stood at the door, and watched him out
of sight—so intently that one might have
thought her watching him passing out of her life.
And in the evening, when she knew he would soon
be home, she dressed herself as for travelling,
wrote a note and left it upon the table, and went
out. She walked by much the same road as
Clifton had gone the night she had left him, and
stopped, curiously enough, at nearly the same
place from which he had watched the silhouette
on the window-blind. The door of the house was
open, and Mrs. Clifton crossed over and stood on
the threshold. The woman who came towards
her stopped in surprise when she saw who her
visitor wjis, and her face paled and flushed. For
a minute they regarded each other silently, and
then Mrs Clifton spoke:
“I am back, you see,” she laughed. “ Now you
know why you did not see him last night.”
“Him—who?”
“ Innocent! ” was the sneering reply. “Weare
fit company for each other, though I am the worse
because I acted so that the world might know.
You tried to be secret.”
The woman’s face was twitching with passion.
“You did more—you came back,” she sneered.
“ Came back to the man you betrayed.”
“I came back,” repeated Mrs. Clifton, “and
went upon my knees, and asked him to forgive
me.”
The retort had a suspicion of pride in it. “ And
he turned you out of doors. It is a wonder he
did not shoot you ! ”
“Indeed ! He forgave me, and took me to his
arms again.”
“ What ? ”
“If he had beaten me, if he had tried to shoot
me, I would have clung to his knees; I would
have cringed before him. And if he had turned me
out of doors, I would have lain like a dog upon
his doorstep until I died. But—he forgave me ! ”
Both women laughed in chorus. They would
not fight now—they thought and felt in unison.
“ And I despised him for it,” Mrs. Clifton went
on. “ And all my love died on the instant. I could
never forgive a man who forgave me that. Could
you ? I hate him—and lam going away again.”
She stepped outside the'door and turned for an
instant.
“He will seek for sympathy to-night when he
knows, and he will come to you.”
But the woman only laughed, and closed the
door.
« * ♦ *
His wife was right. When Clifton read the
note she had left for him, in his rage and disap-
pointment he almost involuntarily walked by the
path he had gone one night before, and stood
again at the old spot. The blind upon which he
had seen the silhouette was unlighted now, and
the house was silent. He crossed the space and
knocked at the door. The only answer he got was
the mocking whistle of an outgoing railway
engine.

In Bed for Months , Terrible Suffering;
Rheumatism Cured; A Limb Saved ; Now Works Hard at 72.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

“ While living at Broken Hill I was subject to lumbago and rheumatism,
having swollen joints which prevented me from working or going about any.
I tried a great many remedies and put out a great many pounds trying to get
rid of my complaints, but to no good.
“As soon as I put my foot on the ground I suffered terrible pain, so I was
obliged to stay in bed for many months.
“ One doctor told me I had the dropsy, and another told me I would have to
lose my leg.
“ But, having heard of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, I decided to try it, and now I am
thankful to say it has completely restored me to health.
w I am now 72 years old, have a splendid appetite, and work hard every
day.”
Mr. John F. Jones, of Cobar, New South Wales, sends us this testimonial
with the above portrait of himself. It is the experience of thousands of others
who have had impurities removed from their system by Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Such testimonies have given to this remedy the name of
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Sick people may be cured if they will only take the right medicine. The
blood must first be made pure, no matter what the disease. With pure blood
nature can go ahead and complete the cure.

PASTEURISED
BUTTER • ••
Xlie same remarks that appl yto milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a tine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few we are
pleased to say only a few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is satisfactory
to know that these are getting less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only per lb. _lt would pay consumers well to give six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, send your Orders to US, and we will deliver it at vour doors.
Ixood butter such as we nave described is appreciated always, whereas at afternoon teas or for ordinary use
a»ny price. The famous “ Berry ” brand Pasteurised butter can be obtained only from this Company.
