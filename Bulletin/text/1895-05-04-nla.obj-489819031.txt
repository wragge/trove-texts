SOME RECENT BOOKS.
Strikes, Labor Questions, and other Econo-
mic difficulties (London : Bliss, Sands and
Foster) has an awkward and misleading
title. The book is really a compact little
treatise on political economy ; and the
author (Mr. A. W. Johnston, of Sydney)
may be heartily congratulated on his per-
formance. Of course, many of his theories
are open to argument (he has not even
commenced to understand the blessings of
Protection) ; of course, he is forced to
dogmatise, for on such a subject every sen-
tence is a text for, a book ten times the
size of his modest Bvo. ; of course, he is
indebted for the bulk of his positions and
arguments to other thinkers. But his
compilation and redaction are so admir-
ably done ; he is so clear, so strong, so
pregnant, and (within his limits) so
thorough, that he can hardly be praised
too highly. Such seed dropped into the
swelling furrow of an enquiring mind will
produce a harvest whose value it is im-
possible to exaggerate. Mr. Johnston’s
cardinal principle is the single-tax on
unimproved land-values, and his state-
ment of it is solid and firm. The extra
chapters on “Imperial Federation” and
“ Australian Credit ” are an anti-climax to
the main argument, and should have been
thrown into the appendix. The book is
strongly recommended to everybody who
has a thinker of his own, and is anxious to
do his own thinking. Cloth, 2s. lOd.
The Mystery of Cioomber, by A. Conan
Doyle (paper, Is. 3d.), is-an unequivocal
surrender to the literary Demos. Not so
long ago, Conan Doyle was going to write
no more detective stories, in the manner
of “Sherlock Holmes,” but devote him-
self entirely to the historical novel for
which he recognised (mistakenly) that his
talent craved. Now he is back again in the
old groove. “The Mystery of Cioomber ”
is only a “Sherlock Holmes” yarn padded
into a small book, with the climax at
the end of 100 pages instead of at the
end of 10. There is certainly a thrill in .
the story, but not enough to justify the
elongation. As in “ The Sign of Four,”
an impending sword terrifies the central
figure; and this time it turns out to be
the sword of Theosophy, which eventually
settles the hash of a wicked General who
has slain a Mahatma. Doyle has a neat
journalistic knack of turning current topics
to the account of his shekel-bag.
How- it Can be Done (cloth, 2s. lOd.) is an
attempt to reply to the constant complaint
of critics of socialism, that it is easy to
pull the old order to pieces, but not easy
to produce a workable scheme for creating
the necessary new era. John Richardson
has produced a book interesting enough,
but not at all helpful in the main difficulty
of socialism-construction which he pro-
fesses to wrestle with and throw. Objec-
tions simply bristle against every step of
his process.

THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “ Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/8 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “ KEEPER” HE ALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,
The JOHN F. TAYLOR COMPANY.

A BIG BIZ!
Cur Trade is Big!, Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day ; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most. People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life am easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require ;
if in town, call every day.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Seal}', and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies, are absolutely pure, and may be use 1 from pimples to scrofula,
from infancy to age, with the most gratifying and unfailing success.
Treatment. Cuticura, the great skin cure, and Cuticura Soap an exquisite
skin purifier and heautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated, surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while,Cuticura Resoi.ven r, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.
“ Alt, about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustrations,

‘A GOLDEN
“The Bulletin’s” Scrap-Book .
SONG-WORDS.
Turning the leaves in an idle way
Of the book I was skimming the other day,
I found a line at the end of a song,
Which keeps on haunting me all day long
With its sweet and mournful melody—
“ Oh, Jane, my love, had you loved but me !”
Sadder a burden could never be
Than, “Jane, my love, had you loved but me!”
Few words and simple—but, O, how much
The singer has told in that little touch !
How hard a story of chances lost,
Of bright hopes blighted and true love crossed
Is heard in the whispered melody,
“ Oh, Jane, my love, had you loved but me !’’
To many a sorrow the key may be ;
“ Ob, Jane, my love, had you loved but me !”
I don’t believe in what poets have said
Of hearts that are broken and lives that are dead ;
Lives well-ordered will stand to their course,
And hearts of true metal ring little the worse;
But they vibrate still to that melody,
“ Oh, Jane, my love, had you loved but me !
My life is well, but what would it be,
Sweet Jane, my love, had you loved but me !”
The world rolls on and years roll by,
Day-dreams vanish and memories die;
But it surges up with a restless pain,
That long-lost longing over again.
Breathed in the passionate melody,
“ Oh, Jane, my love, had you loved but me,
My life is well, but what would it be,
Sweet Jane, my love, had you loved but me?’
TWO WOMEN.
The shadows lay along Broadway,
’Twas near the twilight-tide—
And slowly there a lady fair
Was walking in her pride ;
Alone walked she; but, viewlessly,
Walked spirits at her side.
Peace charmed the street beneath her feet,
And Honor charmed the air;
And all astir looked kind on her,
And called her good as fair—
For all God ever gave to her,
She kept with chary care.
She kept with care her beauties rare
From lovers warm and true,
For her heart was cold to all but gold,
And the rich came not to woo —
But honored well are charms to sell
If priests the selling do.
Now, walking there was one more fair—
A slight girl, lily-pale ;
And she had unseen company
To make the spirit quail :
’Twixt Want and Scorn she walked forlorn,
And nothing could avail.
No mercy now can clear her brow
For this world’s peace to pray ;
For. as love’s wild prayer dissolved in air,
Her woman’s heart gave way !
But the sin forgiven lay Christ in heaven
By man is cursed alway !
NATHANIEL P. WILLIS.
LEONAINIE.
(After Edgar Allan Poe.)
Leonainie, angels called her,
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and trained her
In a smile qf white.
And they made her hair of the gloomy
Midnight, and her eyes of the bloomy
Moonshinej and they brought her to me
In a solemn night.
In a solemn night of summer
When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to meet the comer,
Like a rose in bloom ;
Then all feelings that oppressed me
Left me there, as joy caressed me—
Lying joy, that caught and pressed me
In the arms of doom.
Then spake the little lisper
In the angel tongue—
Yet, I, listening, heard her whisper—
Songs are only sung
Here below that they may grieve you,
Tales are told you' to deceive you,
So must Leonainie leave you
While her love is young.
Then God smiled and it was morning,
Matchless and supreme,
Heaven’s glory seemed adorning
All earth with its esteem.
Every heart but mine seemed gifted
With the voice of prayer, and lifted
Where my Leonainie drifted
From me like a dream.
A bee-farm is about to be started in the

story now running in an English periodical, are

A Lag-Time Legend.
m tv i i n i 4 a Tttn
The Disorderly Conduct Suppression Bill,
successfully piloted through the JSew boutli
Wales Council by Mr. R. E. O’Connor,
M.L.A., is another proof that the province
has not forgotten the w r ays of its lag-time
forefathers. Not that the proof is seriously
, , m . t
needed. The country is still very new its
ancient history is but a thing of yesterday,
and there still survive patriarchs from among
the people of the old, gory regime to. keep
its memory putrid in the laud. But Mr.
O’Connor’s bill, and his supporters in the
Upper House, and the one or two papers
which dare to enthuse over them, all help to
remind us that the convict epoch is nearer
than it seems. The history of the New
South Wales criminal code, from its com-
mencement down to the present day, has
been short aud simple. It began with the
cat and the gallows. It developed'mto more
cat and more gallows. Then an epoch of
Botany Bay humanitariauism—which is
wholly different from every other kind of
humanitariauism—set in, and there was cat
aud a little less gallows. 1 hereafter, for a
number of years, there were cat and gallows
in varying quantities and degrees,and now the
Lag. Council has decided that what the couu-
try needs is more cat. In the beginning the
morals of the population were generally bad,
and the cat was prescribed for their improve-
ment. They grew worse, and more cat was
prescribed to arrest theii decline. limy
grew no better, and a little less cat was tried,
to see if that would effect any change.
Thereafter they improved considerably, and
the aggregate foolishness uf the Upper
House recognises the improvement with
joy, and feels that the only thing required
to make it permanent and cont inuous is
more cat. Its utter inability to recognise
any possible remedy for a mind diseased
save the cat is stupid, pitiable, abject—but
then the Upper House is all these things by
nature, and swinish and ignorant to boot.
* • #
Mr. R. E. O’Connor’s bill is noteworthy
as being, in some respects, about the best
example of the Council’s innate callousness
which has appeared for a good many years,
In other respects it is a well-meaning but
stupid measure, which only escapes being
commend .ble because the draughtsman could
not got out of the old groove or forget the
old precedents. Its main provision is con
tained in clause 5, which enacts that any
male above the age of 18 (the prescribed
was at first twelve years) who commits a
violent and unprovoked assault may bo sen-
tenced, at the discretion of one magistrate,
to imprisonment with hai’d labor for 12
months and three floggings of 30 lashes each.
Hitherto it has required two magistrates to
order the lash, and even then their powers
in this direction were comparatively limited.
Thus a certain semblance of decency was
kept up, for it seldom happened that the two
stipendiaries were drunk at the same time,
or, if they were, it often chanced that only
one was a bloodthirsty drunk. It is a suffi-
ciently well-known fact that many magis-
trates are alcoholised, and many more know
very little law, and have tempers that are
aggravated by various inflammatory diseases,
and that they give strangely unaccountable
decisions, and are commonly addicted to
rushing through ninety cases in sixty minutes,
in consequence of which the prisoner’s de-
fence generally has to go unheard. But,
with all, the fact that two magistrates acting
conjointly are necessary before the most
horrible penalties of Botany Bay law can
be inflicted without the intervention of a
Supreme Court Judge and jury, has helped
to preserve some faint semblance of decency.
Mr. O’Connor’s Bill is apparently intended to
do away with all that. When it becomes law,
the magistrate, whoever he may be, who holds
the record for velocity, while he is getting
through ninety cases in sixty minutes, may
stop just half-a-second on case No. 47 to
order twelve months and three floggings,
and then be well on with case No. 62 before
the prisoner is fairly removed out of the
Court. Or the drunken magistrate, or the
bloodshot stipendiary with the corrugated
liver, may do the same between two hic-
cups. The worst and most ferocious punish-
ment in all the criminal co le is to be put
within the jurisdiction of the lowest, worst-
paid, least educated, most insignificant indi-
vidual on the Bench. After this the only
thing required to round off the measure and
make it absolutely complete, is a proviso that
the death penalty may be inflicted by the
back-blocks magistrate, or by Patrick
O’Booligan Mac Mullins, Esq., the bush
J.P.
» • *
The other clauses provide that any person
convicted of riotous or indecent conduct
shall be liable to a fine of £2O, with the
alternative of six months’ gaol for the first
offence, to six months “ without the option”
for the second, and to twelve months for the
third ; that any person convicted of either of
the above offences, with wilful injury to
property in addition, shall be liable for the
first offence to a fine of £2O with the alterna-
tive of twelve months, and to makegood the
damage, and for the second offence to twelve
months without the option ; and that any
person who adds the throwing of road-metal
to riot or indecency shall be liable to nine
months’ imprisonment if alone, or twelve
months if acting in collusion with others.
All these penalties are fully justifiable, if
they are likely to be operative, but as they
are not they are mere fooolishness. There
is already abundance of law for the sup-
pression of riot, assault and similar offences,
but in 99 cases out of 109 a weak-kneed and
morally groggy magistrate lets the murderous-
assault man off with a fine which varies from
20s. to £lO. In the remaining case two
ferocious “beaks’ probably order imprison-
ment and a tremendous flogging. The exist-
ing law says that the magistrate “ may
order the brutal larrikin a long term of hard
labor, but he does nothing of the kind. The
new law says that the same mentally groggy
magistrate “may” order a longer term of
imprisonment, but the man who lacks the
courage or the sense to enforce one law will
fail equally to enforce the other Because
the present law is a dead letter, larr kinism
flourishes. And beoauselarrikinism flourishes,
R. E. O’Connor and the hoggish Legislative
Council propose to give to the one ferocious
magistrate who can be found here and there
amid a crowd of fools and weaklings, power
to inflict, at his own sole discretion, horrible
tortures upon one casual criminal where a
thousand others escape.
# # *
If the proposed Bill gets on the Statute-
Book, to be an eternal disgrace to the people
of New South Wales, the results will be very
much as foffows ;—There will still be not
half, or nearly half, enough police and detec-
tives to capture criminals, therefore the same
large proportion will escape as heretofore.
The weakness of the force will make it diffi-
cult, just as it always- has been, to find the
right criminal, even when an arrest is made,
therefore the tendency to capture somebody,
very much at random, and push a conviction
against him on insufficient evidence, will
still remain. The same foolish and
weak kneed magistrate, who now fines
the street ruffian 295. when the law says he
“may” be sentenced to six months’ hard
labor will continue to fine him 20s. when
R. E. O’Connor’s new law says he “ may ”
be sentenced to 12 months, with or without
three floggings. But in two or three places
there will arise two or three butcher-like
stipendiaries, with a ghoulish love for the
cat and the triangles, who will sentence
prisoners freely to the utmost horrors of the
law. And, as the stipendiary butcher will
only get his own very small share of really
hard cases, lie will gratify his gory instincts
by inflicting these sentences on comparatively
minor offenders. Therefore, if the man who
comes within an ace of actual murder is
brought up before any one of the great mul-
titude of feeble and incapable magistrates,
he will be fined the same old 20s. or £5 ;
and if the man who is charged with a com-
paratively trifling assault, on the evidence,
possibly, of a very dubious policeman, is
brought before a magistrate of the other
description, he stands a fair chance of being
sentenced to 12 months and 90 lashes. The
evil of the present system is that the
police court law is a gamble, where the
heaviest sentence goes to the greatest
or the least offender indiscriminately,
and where the magistrate has so much “ dis-
cretion ” that he can (and generally does)
fine the genteel offender in a tall silk hat in
the sum of a few shillings, and at the same
time can (and often does) visit the man in
moleskins and blucher-boots with three
months for an exactly similar offence. And
Mr. O Connor’s bill, which says simply that
the perp strator of an aggravated assault
“ may ” be flogged or imprisoned, or both,
leaves the magistrate power to flog or im-
prison the workman, and fine the tall-hatted
criminal a few shillings as heretofore. If an
equally scandalous latitude were granted in
the Supreme Court, then the penalty for
wilful murder would be anything from £5
fine up to the gallows, and the Judge could
inflict either punishment according to his
liver, or the social status of the murderer.
* « •
A measure for the suppression of dis-
orderly conduct, riot, brutal assault, and
the like, is wanted in New South Wales
more than almost any other kind of crimi-
nal legislation. But, if it is to be
effective, it requires to be built on very
different principles from the bill of Mr.
O’Connor, M.L.G. The first essential is to
largely strengthen the police force, which
now consists of one man to every 175 square
miles—to double it at the very least, and
possibly to treble it ; also, to greatly increase
the detective force, and raise the pay of the
officers to a figure at which they can all
afford to be passably honest, and at which
none of them will be absolutely compelled
to eke out their miserable official pittances by
bribes from gambling-houses, brothels, fan-
tan dens, totalisators, and the like. The
expense would be large, but it could easily
be met by charging a halfpenny postage on
newspapers, to quote the simplest and most
equitable out of a dozen possible means of
raising revenue. By this reform there would
be a fair chance of catching the criminal in
the first instance where, in a large propor-
tion of cases, he now escapes altogether.
Further, there would be a better chance of
catching him promptly, and of catching the
right criminal. No amount of bloodthirsti-
ness in the criminal code will do anything
towards suppressing crime unless the offender
can be secured with something like reason-
able certainty to begin with, yet the legis-
lators, whose one idea of reform is to make
the code more and more b irbarous, seem
unable to comprehend this self-evident axiom.
• • •
A second and equally essential reform is
to make punishment certain and reliable
after the offender is captured and oonviote 1.
The present statute allows the police magis-
trate to visit disorderly conduct or aggravated
assault with a long term of hard labor. The
common plea that it has failed to diminish
these offences and that it is necessary to re-
inforce it with additional barbarities is
utterly false ; the existing law has never yet
had a trial. Only the other day, in Sydney,
a crowd of ruffians who nearly murdered a
publican without"- provocation were let off
with aggregate fines of £l5, and this was an
unusual instance of severity ; the average
price of a murderous assault is £5. The kind
of statute that is wanted is one enacting that
the person who commits a savage and unpro-
voked attack upon another shall get six
months hard labor for the first offence, and
an increased sentence for subsequent offences,
without any discretion whatever on the part
of the magistrate. Circumstances have long
since proved that the average “beak ” is not
naturally endowed with discretion, and the
laws efforts to compel him to possess
that valuable quality have utterly failed.
Also, in cases of larrikinism, disor-
derly conduct, wilful destruction of pro-
perty and indecency, a hard and fast
minimum punishment should be decreed, so
that the P.M. shall be compelled to adminis-
ter the law which he now practically ignores.
And, if the Legislature desires to maintain
the cat and triangles as features of the crimi-
nal code, let it enact—not that they “ may ”
be applied for certain offences, at the discre-
tion of the Bench, or according to its liver,
or in a fixed ratio to the clothes of the
offender ; but that they shall be applied to
these offences, so that the criminal in a new
suit and a high collar must stand on the same
plane as the one in moleskins. The system
by which the magistrate or the J.P. is
allowed to enforce the law or ignore it, at his
own sole will and pleasure, is a public dis-
grace and one of the principal causes of
crime, and the Legislature which abolishes
it will do more good to New South Wales
than all the uncivilised lawmakers of the past
century.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bankruptcy, Composition and
Decomposition.
Now that most of Melbourne’s large and evil-
smelling boomers hive got their compositions
through and have paid one fink, or there-
ab mbs, in the alleged £, the Victorian authori-
ties are thinking about amending their utterly
scandalous insolvency law. As a preliminary
measure, a “ Board ” was recently appointed to
find out what was the matter with the present
system, and this body started out to take evi-
dence. It sat for one day, and in that brief
period it was staggered by such a mass of
ugly revelations that it adjourned for a
week’s rest. Judge Molesworth and Mr.
Jacomb, assignee of the Insolvency Court, were
the two witnesses examined, and the following
are a few of the facts elicited : It is a common
practice for the big and knowing insolvent to
give bills to all his friends for imaginary debts;
these friends then roll up at the meeting, and
either bully the real creditors or outvote them,
and decide to take a composition of, perhaps,
in the £. Solicitors who “ know how to do
it ” bear a hand in this work. In country dis-
tricts, the Registrar is mostly an underpaid
youth of little experience, and “ obvious influ-
ences ” are brought to bear to make him
grant a discharge in cases which won’t
bear inspection. “ Obvious influences,” by the
way, is a term which might include wine, lovely
woman, a knowledge of the feeble youth’s
amours, his unpaid tailor’s bill, hard cash, or
many other circumstances. Where liquidation
is resorted to, the insolvent’s “ friends,” being
the majority, often secure the appointment of
another complaisant friend as trustee, while the
real creditors make unavailing protests. The
friend thus appointed generally contrives to
smother any objectionable person who wants to
inquire into things, and he is often paid, out of
the estate, much more than the amount fixed by
law, especially in a case where much smother-
ing is required. The law requires the trustee
to file quarterly accounts, giving some reason-
able excuse for the disappearance of the
assets supposed to be in his charge, but
he often fails to do this. Sometimes—not
often, though—he is sacked in consequence, but
even then he is only sacked so far as that par-
ticular estate is concerned, and his unreliability
is no bar to his continuing in the business.
The trustee and the solicitor often “hold
examinations in court until the assets are all
gone, the money being practically divided”
between the two of them. The law declares that
a bankrupt can’t get his rele ise on less than a 7s.
in the £ dividend, except in cases of unusual
misfortune; therefore, as Judge Molesworth
remarked, “ it is merely a case of hard swear-
ing.” The man who swears to a series of
astonishing misfortunes gets off; the man
who isn’t good at swearing doesn’t. The often
fraudulent |d. in the £ composition never even
comes before the court in the ordinary way of
business; it is secretly “sanctioned” as a
matter of course by a small clerk on payment
of 20s. Unclaimed dividends are supposed to
be paid into the Treasury, but they are very
often retained by the trustee and never again
heard of. Under the present system “ a
man can make up a fictitious list of creditors
and pay what dividend he pleases.” If half
the allege I debts are fictitious then half the
total dividend is clear profit to somebody. A
list of twenty defaulting trustees some
of them with thousands of pounds un
accounted for was produced, and this
did not profess to be a complete list either. It
was further explained that one of the conditions
of the appointment of a trustee was that he
should halve his commission with the creditors
—often bogus creditors—who voted for his
appointment, and that “all the big men in
Melbourne ” followed this fraudulent practice.
It was just here that the court was overcome
with emotion and felt its legs giving way
beneath it, and consequently it had to adjourn
for a week. The Victorian insolvency Ixw is a
thing which needs to be approached gently, and
stirred up with a long pole from a distance.
When it is stirred up suddenly, at close
quarters, no board can stand the odor.
The N.S.W. Civil Service Commission.
The New South Wales Civil Service Commis-
sion has presented a report which is calculated
to make the aggregate hair of the community
stand on end. It states, among other things,
that, in some of the more gorgeous departments,
the messenger—the man who runs about with
letters and fixes an arrogant eye on visitors—
gets as much as £3OO a year. Many other mes-
sengers get from £125 to £2OO. The individual
who works the lift is paid on the same inflated
scale. There are 7009 temporary officers, many
of whom are quite unnecessary. In many
cases one or two clerks are the sole occupants
of a room, and the waste of space thus involved
makes it necessary to hire much office accoim
modation at high rentals. Many highly-paid
officers are employed solely in pottering over
books which could be kept by any boy of
reasonable intelligence. The audit is often
months in arrear, and, except in the case of the
Customs, there is no personal audit whatever;
the department simply forwards its vouchers
by post, and its books are not even examined.
Consequently one series of frauds went on
for eight years without the large and vastly
expensive Audit Department taking the
slightest notice of the matter. The sei-
vice is full of useless inspectors. In the
words of the report: “The country is abso-
lutely overrun with Government officers trave -
ling ; you cannot go to any town without find-
ing 9 half-a-dozen different inspectors inspecting
water-tanks, police-stations and public build
ings,” &o. This, by the way, takes no account
of Dibbs’ “ inspectors of agriculture.” I* l ®
Master in Equity reports that he has one
accountant for whom he has no earthly use,
and the Statistician complains about an officer
in his department (salary, £470 per annum) toi
whom there is no employment whatever, am
two others whose salaries are in excess of then
value. The expenses in connection with
charitable institutions are reported to be grossly
extravagant. In the Treasury the salaries are
exorbitant, the officials too numerous, and the
work slovenly. In the Customs, much simp o
work which could be done by boys is in the
hands of highly-paid officials ; the landing-
waiter (£334 a year) is superfluous ; and the
costly steam launch is far too expensive and
dignified for its work. TheGovqrnmentPrintulg'
office is reported to be choked up with vast
misses of unsoll and unused literature


ordered for publication by the Assembly ; the
quantity now on hand having cost £26,000 to
produce, and having & saleable value _ of
about £IOO. Some of these volumes, which
nobody ever reads, are bound at a charge of
365. per volume. The Health Board, the
almost useless Marine Board, the pilot-service,
and the quarantine staff are all either over-
manned or overpaid, or both. The Public In-
struction Department, for some unexplained
reason, keeps an architectural staff of its own,
instead of having its work done by the Govern-
ment Architect’s office. The number of Circuit
Courts and Courts of Quarter Sessions is reported
to be excessive, and in small towns the billets
of land agent and C.P.S. might be amalgamated.
The prospecting vote of £20,000 a year is ap-
parently almost absolute waste; out of the
mines assisted from this vote not one in 400
has proved payable. The Examiner of Coal-
fields is a useless excrescence; there is no
more need for him than for an examiner of
granite. Also, there are two clerks (£514 per
annum) attached to the diamond drill. The
rents of mining leases are £14,000 in arrear ;
and the Government Metallurgist (£I3OO a year)
has been drawing his salary for three years, but
has been unable to do any work because no work-
shop or apparatus have been provided. The Post
Dili ;e, the Lan Is, the Education Department,
and most other public offices are in a similar con-
demn of muddle and chaos. Altogether, the
c nnmission points out that £250,000 a year can
be saved, chiefly by abolishing officers who got
their appointments by political influence, and
for whom there is no useful employment what-
ever. A good many other commissions, by the
way, have pointed out the same thing, and the
.only result has been that one batch of useless
officers was sacked, and pensioned or “com-
pensated ” out of the insolvent superannuation-
fund, and the uncles ami cousins and supporters
„of the Ministry appointed in their places.
Faymen; of Members.
The value of the main point in the attempt to
upset Payment of Members in New South
Wales can be judged by every person who reads
and writes English. Here is clause 2 from the
Enabling Act of ’B9 :
Every member of the Legislative Assembly now serving
or hereafter to serve therein shall, unless he is one of the
persons specified or referred to in the next following
section, be entitled to receive by way of reimbursement
for expenses incurred hy him in the discharge of his Par-
liamentary duties an allowance at the rate of t3OO per
annum, which shall he charged on the consolidat'd
revenue fund, and be payable monthly to every in m ier
o: this present Legislative Assembly now serving, from
the date ..f the passing of this Act, and to every member
hereafter elect d from the lime of his taking his seat,
and in every case until he shall resign or his seat be
vacated, or until Parliament shall be dissolved or shall
expire by effluxion of time.
The Consolidated Fat Man alleges that this
clause can only refer to the Legislative Assembly
of the Parliament which passed the Act, “ in-
asmuch as the words ‘ hereafter to serve
therein ’ could only apply to the Legislative
Assembly previously mentioned, and such
Legislative Assembly was defined by the words
‘ now serving therein ’ to be the Legislative
Assembly in existence at the date of the passing
of the Act.” Which doesn’t follow; and the
more you look at it the less it seems to follow.
For look at the whole clause. It divides
itself easily into two patts : one referring
to “ the Legislative Assembly ” in its permanent
aspect, and the other to “ this present Legisla-
tive Assembly ” in its temporary aspect. If
these are identical, why not “ the Legislative
Assembly” throughout ? why lay such emphatic
stress upon “ this present Legislative Assem-
bly?” Simply because there was a contention
at the time that such legislation should only be
prospective, and the Assembly was anxious to
put beyond doubt that its members also were
entitled to reimbursement. Hence, very clearly
and logically, the clause first lays down the
{irinciple of payment as applied to “ the Legis-
ative Assembly”—the Legislative Assembly
recognised as part of the Constitution of the
province—and then makes definite application
of the principle to the members of tlxe Legis-
lative Assembly then sitting. In this
view, the neat verbal obstacle raised by
the O.F.M. is quite off the track of the
■argument. It is a weak obstacle, anyhow.
Suppose that the clause read: “Every mem-
ber of the Parliament of New South Wales now
serving, or hereafter to serve therein, shall,”
&c. Would that refer only to a single Parlia-
ment or to the Parliament of all time ? To the
■latter, decidedly ; especially when “the Parlia-
ment of New Soutli Wales ” was contrasted
with “ this present Parliament of New South
Wales now serving.” The words “ the Legis-
lative Assembly ” can be used in precisely the
same general sense as “ the Parliament of New
South Wales.” The phrase “ hereafter to serve
therein” applies just as well to M.’s.L.A. 500
years hence. They will be just as much members
of “the Legislative Assembly ” as are any who sit
to-day. The Legislative Assembly has a generic,
continuous aspect as well as a special, limited
lispect. It is at the same time a chain and a
link in a chain. Therefore, to mark the differ-
ence, the draughtsman of the Payment of
Members Act refers to it as “ the Legislative
Assembly ” in the large sense, and “ this pre-
sent Legislative Assembly ” in the small sense.
What m ue can he do? Is he to slur over the
fact that “ the Legislative Assembly ” is a part
of and co-exists with a permanent Parliament,
and lay stress only on the fact that “ a Legis-
lative Assembly,” like a Parliament, has a
beginning and end ? We have a succession of
Parliaments, but only one Parliament; a succes-
sion of Legislative Assemblies, but only one
“the Legislative Assembly.” Doubtless, in
d tily newspaper perspective, which magnifies
objects close 'at hand and dwarfs those at a
distance, “ the Legislative Assembly ” means
the particular Legislative Assembly sitting on
the day the paper is published. But an Act of
Parliament is not a daily newspaper, and it
deals, not with 24 hours, but with all time.
And it should be easy to show from the N.S.W.
Parliamentary records that the Payment of
Members Act was certainly looked upon as pro-
viding for future Parliaments; and that the prin-
ciple was all the more contested on that account.
But if the Privy Council—to which the case
is pretty sure to go—should take a view
contrary to this argument, there wJI indeed be
a joyous rattling of legislators whose right
hands are regularly lifted in denunciation of
payment of members, while their left hands as
regularly pouch the pay. The spectacle of a
lot of members—among them the most marvel-
lously-resurrected corpse in Australian politics
—absorbing their monthly cash like dry sponges
while reiterating “ I, Mr. Speaker, am utterly
opposed to payment of members ”—endeavor-
ing to cry on one side of their faces and laugh
on the other, to combine the most sincere private
grief with the most sincere appearance of public
joy—will indeed be an interesting spectacle.
Unfortunately, the country cannot be content
to admire the comedy. If the Privy Council
makes Payment of Members illegal under the
present Act, then a new Act must be passed at
once to legalise it. Willy-nilly, shilly-shally,
Wobbler Reid must be forced to beard the Leg.
Council in its den. Payment of Members is the
keystone of democratic government as at
present conducted. It is a bridge which
spans the gulf between the class legisla-
tion of the past, when only wealthy men
could afford to sit in Parliament and
wdien they naturally made law's in the interest
of wealthy men exclusively, and the broader,
if still imperfect, legislation of the present,
through which the representatives of the
workers voice the workers’ greater needs and
claims. Land Acts and Local Government Acts
are mere excrescences compared with the vital
Payment of Members question. Get a good
representative Parliament and good representa-
tive legislation will follow. But it is useless to
expect a decent superstructure without a sound
foundation.
The Royal Commission Agitation.
Mr. W. A. Walker aspires to instruct the
Dean Salvation Committee as to the law of
New South Wales post-conviction inquiries. As
Premier Reid had, a few days previously,
instructed the Legislative Assembly on the
same subject' the Dean Committee was pro-
bably fully seized of the law thus again worried
by Mr. Walker —section 283 of the Criminal
Law Amendment Act. It is true that this sec-
tion provides for the holding of a further
enquiry by “ any justice,” but it is also true
that the section declares that such “justice”
can only hold such enquiry “ by direction of
the Governor, on the petition of the prisoner, or
some person on his behalf;” or “by direction
of a Judge of the Supreme Court of his own
motion.” Applying this machinery to the
Dean case: “ Governor,” no doubt, means
“ Governor-in-Oouncil,” i.e. , the Executive. If
so, the Executive lias already decided to
bury Dean alive, and it would be waste
of time to petition that body. Assuming,
on the other hand, it means the “ Governor ”
personally, the present occupant of the
vice-regal office is only Lieutenant-Governor,
and is, officially to the community, the Chief
Justice. As Chief Justice, Mr. Darley could
order an enquiry before a J.P., “of his own
motion.” He doesn’t, and so it seems useless
to apply to him. The New South Wales public
is not such a flat as to ask— (a) Windeyer, J.,
to order a further enquiry, after declaring that
he felt as assured of Dean’s guilt as if he had
seen him apply and supply the poison ; or (b)
expect any other Supreme Court Judge, “of
his own motion,” to interfere gratuitously with
one of “ Brother Windeyer’s ” cases. There-
fore, to all practical intents and purposes, so
far as the entombed Dean is concerned, the
283rd section of the Criminal Law Amendment
Act might never have been drafted, and Mr. W.
A. Walker, of “ Chambers,” is vexing his soul
unprofitably, and casting technical instruction
upon the waste places of the community.
♦
Could there be any more convincing illustra-
tion of the national indecency and positive
wickedness of a political Attorney-General-
ship than the recent developments of
the Dean case? That it should be pos-
sible for a man to be appointed Attorney-
General, not merely because he is an honor-
able lawyer of upright judgment, but
because, also, he has been a more or less
foxy politician—is of itself sufficiently bad.
But that an Attorney-General who has been
Crown Prosecutor and special pleader against
a prisoner ; who has, no matter how sincerely,
pronounced his opinion of that prisoner’s guilt;
and who has succeeded in getting that prisoner
sentenced to death, possibly as the result of an
utterly incorrect theory; should afterwards
be called upon and expected to take his seat at
the Executive Council, and, as by far its most
masterful member, help in deciding whether
that prisoner was fairly tried and justly sen-
tenced all this is so revolting to ideas of fair-
play that one is inclined to ask himself
which barbarous nation owns him as a
citizen. With the Dean incidents freshly
in mind, a political Attorney-General be-
comes an emblem of the forgotten horrors of
a Star-Chamber inquisition. There is in New
South Wales no more manly man all round than
Mr. Want, Q.C. ; but wasn’t Mr. Want
Attorney-General at the time of the hideous
Mount Rennie trial ? If so, is he content to
allow the unslaughtered survivors to linger in
prison after such a trial? The Bulletin
invites the attention l of the press and poli-
ticians and public of Australasia to the hours
over which the Mount Rennie trial extended,
and to the subsequent careers of the two Crown
witnesses on whose testimony the case for the
prosecution was chiefly based.
Premier Reid (N.S.W.) states, as definitely as
he ever states anything, that he won’t even
consider the advisability of appointing a Public
Defender. Under the present system, when a
serious crime is committed, the police arrest
the person who, in the opinion of Constable
O’ Hooligan, is the most probable criminal.
Then the police and detectives proceed to work
up evidence agaiist him, and the Crown
Law Department prepares the case, and the
Treasury supplies the needful funds, and
l vo or three able barristers are en-
gaged at great expense to impress upon the
jury, to the utmost of their ability, every point
that can tell against the accused, and to slur
over or discredit or explain away or flatly con-
tradict everything that can tell in his favor.
Meanwhile, the prisoner is locked up in his cell;
he can’t get round to hunt up evidence for the
defence, or to see that what evidence is avail-
able isn’t tampered with or suppressed ; very
often he has no money with which to hire a
solicitor or only enough to engage a cheap and
inefficient one; and he seldom can find the large
sums required to hire private detectives to
collect testimony on his behalf. Also, if he
pays a lawyer, he has no means of making sure
that that lawyer does his duty. Therefore, in
the case of a poor prisoner, only one side of
the story is presented to the jury ; it is only in
the case of a rich prisoner (who can gain his
release on bail in cases where a penniless man
has to stay in gaol) that both aspects of the
affair are fairly put before the court. And
about the only straight and definite statement
which Premier Reid has made during his term
of office is that he won’t even consider the
advisability of doing something to correct this
monstrous injustice.

The N.Q. Sugar Co., it is said, has entered into
a direct engagement with a number of Japanese
to become its tenant-farmers at Bundaberg.
The Jap. thus leaves the sphere of wages-rnan
for that of independent employer and contrac-
tor, like the Tweed (N.S.W.) _ Kanaka.
Mongrel-land will be a gay place in another
10 years. By - the - by, Melanesian Bishop
Wilson points out that the Northern province
is regarded by island Kanakas as a dumping-
ground for inconvenient criminals. All bad
characters are handed over to the recruiting
slavers. In the Christianised island of
Florida, says the Bishop, a man killed his
wife, and the local missionary brought in
a verdict of manslaughter. “ The people
decided that the man could not stay on the
island, so I believe they packed him off to a
distant island. Even there the people would
not keep him, and sent him to Queensland.”
Queensland, the Kanaka convict settlement !
The Bulletin begins to understand the Mackay
murders, the Geraldtou outrages, and the reason
why six Bundaberg “ boys ” lie at present under
sentence of death for battering the brains out
of a wretched white swagsman. QuEEN’s-land !
There is something apt in the name, after all.
Slavery and murder are monarchy’s recognised

S.M. Herald pays a grudging compliment to
the Labor-party in New South Wales Parlia-
ment :
From the earliest hour at which the House assem-
bles to the latest at which it rises, there is one section
which is found always to be represented at approximately
its full strength.
Meanwhile, the representatives of Fat are not
nearly so assiduous ; they are frequently absent
on business or pleasure ; and the Herald calls
upon Premier Reid to undertake no important
business till it is convenient for them to attend.
Which is equivalent to an admission that the
Labor-members give the cream of their brains
and time to the service of the country, while
their opponents offer up only the fag-ends which
they have to spare from private affairs. There-
fore, the Herald would penalise—not the idle
members, the laggards and sluggards, but the
industrious ones who recognise that the State
which pays their salaries has first claim on their
attention. Fat logic !
Ed. Bulletin. —At Mildura (Vic.) Trenwith,
M.L.A., said, among other things :
There must be some.hing radically wrong when there
was more wheat, more houses, more merchandise in the
world than ever before, and cheaper than ever before, and
yet more hungry, homeless, and ill-clad people. The in-
troduction of machinery had cheapened production, and
had displaced labor. The problem was to find employ-
ment at living wages for the displaced labor. There was
enough for everybody in the world, but it was badly dis-
tributed. — Arhus report.
Whereupon the jocular man of the Argus pro-
claimed Trenwith as an opponent of machinery
and progress. Trenwith was compared to the
Chinese Mandarin who took this objection to a
proposed local railway:
That the 25,000 men who now gain a living by each
carrying two slung half-hundredweight boxes of tea to
the seaboard would he deprived of work.
Trenwith has a right to know what the Argus
would do about those 25,000 men, anyhow. If
the railway would produce such increased
wealth as to permit compensation being given
to them, then an equitable progress might be
attained. But the progress that would sacri-
fice the living of 25,000 men and their families
to make a railway syndicate’s fortune is so
characteristically Tory as to need no apology.
The Argus has a short memory. On Bth April,
nine days before, it spoke thus :
Their (the Electric Light Oo.’s)grievance possesses none
of the harsh features of the case of the innumerable cab-
drivers who were swept off the city thoroughfares, with-
out a shilling of compensation or an atom of sympathy
from anybody, by the Tramway Co.
The Argus can admit on occasion the anomalies
of its sort of “ progress.” The Socialist has no
grievance against Progress, or any of its ser-
vants, not excluding machinery. It is when
machinery enriches a few by depriving many
that the system which permits such injustice
becomes particularly obnoxious. The question
is, not the prohibition of machinery, but the
equitable distribution of its advantages. Com-
petition, Supply and Demand, the Tory trinity,
professes to keep watch over the “ progress of
the race ” —but it dues not even pretend to care
for the wants of the unit. Socialism bases its
calculations on the unit’s necessities.—F.
Dear Bulletin, — New South Wales sugar-
growers petition Parliament not to remove
the duty from sugar. Their petition
should be accompanied by an undertak-
ing to employ only white labor. The object
of a protective policy is to save the white
Australian from degrading competition with
cheap alien labor. But the New South
Whiles sugar industry thrives partly by the
employment of colored aliens. That is to say,
the white worker has to pay more for his sugar
in order, not that his fellow-worker may be
employed to the general benefit, but in order
that cheap black-trash may be employed at an
exorbitant profit to the general loss. That is not
Protection. Protection should logically pro-
tect just as much against the cheap laborer as
against the product of cheap labor. The sugar
industry, as carried on in Q. and New South
Wales, does not deserve protection. If we
have to consume the products of black labor, it
is Better to get them cheaply and keep the
black laborer in Fiji and Java, than to pay
dearly for them and bring the black laborer
within our own boundaries to compete with the
white worker. A stink abroad is better than a
stink at home. The bonused Australian sugar-
industry is at present almost entirely a colored-
labor industry. It should be compelled to
choose which it will give up —its bonus or its
niggers.—B.B.
The attitude of the Australian Scotch kirk con-
science towards gambling is a most humorous
contribution to the discussion on that subject.
Meenister Miller started out to tell the Meen-
isters’ Association that “ gambling is one of the
open sewers in the national life of the people,”
a vice with which Christians should have noth-
ing whatever to do in any shape or form. It
is thievery pure and simple, even when it
takes the form of a church-bazaar lottery or
lucky-bag. In the same breath, the learned
theologian declared that “ the spirit of gamb-
ling and speculation ” is, “ to a certain extent,
necessary for the prosecution of business, and
for the development of the resources of the
country.” Also, on the other hand, the Stock
Exchange brokers are “dangerously close to
distinct gambling-!” Minister Clouston has
a holy hatred of gambling, but “ can trace a
very decided difference between a raffle in a
church bazaar and a sweepstake on a horse-
race.” So can most people, inasmuch as the
sweepstake is generally worth winning, and the
church raffle isn’t. All of which is analytically
interesting as showing how tenderly accommo-
dating the kirk conscience is on deep matters of
duty. In short: “ Thy raffle is a Satanic abom-
ination and hateful to the Loard ; ma lottery is
a trusting enquiry consairning the will of (lord”
The international monetary conference is about
to sit somewhere down under, and the Agents-
General, by instruction, are clamoring to get
Australia a seat at the board. By whose
authority the governments are making this
move, nobody knows. What opinions the
Premiers want given utterance to, nobody
knows. What currency complexion the repre-
sentatives is to have, nobody knows. Is he to
be a monometallic worshipper of Supply and
Demand ? Is he to be a bimetallist who believes
Asia can be dished on the exchanges ? Is he to
be a gold man, a silver man, a paper man—or
a man of straw? Is he to vote with the best
dinners —or with the biggest coronets ? What
good will he do, anyhow, whoever he is ? The
Premiers have no warrant for making the
appointment, even if it is of no importance to
anybody, as is most probable. Some of the
Premiers, no doubt, regard it as a mere
advertising dodge. But it may be a
dodge to foist a choice assortment of
currency fads on Australia. It is very diffi-
cult to see why these provinces should get
mixed up in the matter at all. There has been
no popular expression of opinion on the subject,
and the only possible excuse for the offidal
action is that one or two of the Premiers think
it is a good opportunity to make a splash. They
are making the splash for all it is l.'trth, which
is not much.
The inhabitants of Eaglehawk (V.v.) and dis-
trict have achieved a rather startling vindica-
tion of the Law’s majesty. Eaglehawk raised
£l2 10s. for the purpose of presenting a
mounted policeman with a token of regard.
The promoters and trustees of this fund pur-
chased a gold locket and chain valued at £lO,
and “ detained ” the odd 50s. “in payment of
expenses incurred in soliciting subscriptions ”
whilst the jeweller who supplied the goods
made out his bill for £l2 10s., and gave a
receipt in full. It was a mean transaction.
The custodians of the cash had no authority to
spend 50s. in liquor, and, considering that they
put themselves forward as the policeman’s
warmest admirers, their action was dishonest
both in sentiment and fact, even though they
may not have made sixpence profit by it. Also,
the jeweller was wilfully aiding an attempt to
deceive the subscribers at the policeman’s ex-
pense. A charge of conspiracy to defraud
was laid against the two subscription-
gatherers and their friend the jeweller. They
were committed for trial, and the jury
some of whom doubtless took a purely Victorian
view of the case, and saw no guilt in a small
“ fakement ” of accounts —couldn’t agree upon
a verdict. Then the three prisoners in turn
pleaded guilty to avoid the mental strain of
another trial, and begged to be let off with
fines. Judge Hodges, with sorrow writ large
on his beautific countenance, proceeded to fine
the prisoners as suggested. The leading trustee
and prime mover in the 50s. conspiracy was
ordered to pay £3OO to the State, whilst the
other two men dropped in for a penalty of £SO
apiece. These sums were forthcoming and the
guilty trio went free to ponder over their folly-
in dealing unfairly with a trumpery subscrip- <
tion fund. “ Swindle ” seems a harsh term to
apply to their misdoing. It was not proved
that the trustees had deliberately robbed any-
body, or that the jeweller had been ready ito
assist in covering up a theft. Their joffit crime
w r as the want of a proper sense of honor
’in the outlay of other people’s money—the
crime which has been committed with impunity
in Victoria when the amount of money con-
cerned was a hundred thousand times greater
than £l2 10s. Nevertheless, it is refreshing
to hear of justice been done, or overdone, for
the satisfaction of any trusting Victorians,
whose confidence was, in a measure, betrayed.
The Crown, which prosecuted in this case, will
doubtless invite complaints from ruined bank
depositors who confided their gold to conscience-
less financiers. Their good “stuff” was in-
vested in property at false valuations. Unjust
stewards have devoured their substance. The
Crown may now see fit to bring the culprits to
book, and perhaps the learned Judge will sum
up unfavorably to the accused. The three
delinquents of Eaglehawk are cordially advised
by The Bulletin to start a society for the en-
couragement of justice all round.
Supply and demand, “red in tooth and
claw with r.iviiiH,’’ shrieks against the creed of
Socialism. It hungers for daily sacrifice of human
victims, and Fat Man is always ready to he high
priest.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
April 30, 1895.
My Dkar Moouabivda—
Everything: seems to conspire nowadays against
Sydney belledom’s chances of getting off the
tenter-hooks of spinsterdom on to the spikes of
matrimony, and the latest and greatest set-hack
seems to me to be the reduction in V. R. allow-
ances recently ukased by Government. The
salaries and allowances —the whole gilded bait, in
fact, attached to the position of A.’sD.C. and
private secretaries —are to be withdrawn, a step
which will save Government -81759 per annum,
but which will not, I venture to assert, prove
economical to the society house-father with a
quiverful of girls.
Looking at the matter from a girl’s point of
view, it would have been distinctly cleverer to
have directly reduced the Governor himself, who is
always married, and a non-starter for the
hymeneal plate,- and left the frequently-
eligible secretaries and aides unshorn. The
aides, above all, for they seem strangely addicted
rushing into matrimony with the white
aborigines—far more so than the secretaries, who
perhaps see too much of the mechanism in the
practice of their calling to ever feel deeply in love
with the daughters of women who grovel for paste-
board permits— not to speak of the little side-
struggles “on their own ” up the social ereasy-pole
on the part of the dear girls themselves, lint now
an inferior brand of Guvmentouse attache, on
something very like board-wages, threatens to
swamp the market, unless the very rosiest chance
happens and some pursey youth is attracted to the
job as a good way to get rid of time and money.
If the Ministry sticks to its resolution, future
aides will be either very rich men or very poor
ones—you may take my word for it.
But, with fuel and lighting allowances also with-
drawn, the new arrangement doesn’t promise an
extra-lively V.R. regime for the Potts Point
brigade. Society may have to strike wax-matches
to find its partner in the gubernatorial salons of
the near future, and it is just possible that winter
guests will be advised on their invitations to bring
Japanese pocket-warmers along with ’em. Also,
the announcement that the State pays for all the
wear and tear to Govt. House fixings will be a
blight on the vindictive variety of lady who has
been known to revenge herself fora dull vice-regal
entertainment and a lack of partners by kicking
the furniture with her sharp French heels. Now
every inch of varnish she peels off is damaged at
the expense of her bleeding country.
The second and more successful of the women’s
meetings to arrange a farewell to Lady Duff
took place at Sydney Town Hall last week,
when it was finally decided (her ladyship having
approved of the scheme) that a memorial tablet
3 lould be erected in Fetteresso church to the
memory of the late Governor, and that Lady Dufif
should be presented with a signed farewell address
by “the women of N.S. Wales.”
People who travelled to Australia with an enter-
tainer, lately making hesitating appearances in
our midst, say that the great man's uninterested
haw-haw style and serene self-complacency gained
him ‘the nick-name of “The Prince” on board
the boat, and all the women conspired to take him
put of winding. At dinner one evening a pretty
Westralian who sat next him asked him punt-
blank why he left the church. And the gifted
creature replied airily and somewhat “suddenly”;
“ Oh, the women! the women !’’ but he looked
very tired for a long time afterwards. The best
of it was that the Westralienne only made a bril-
liant guess at his having sported the cloth (once a
parson always a parson—nobody of any perspi
cuity ever makes a mistake over an ex-shepherd,
no m itter how low the subject’s evening vest is
cut), and the great man, who, no doubt, wished
to suppress the surplice episode, was evidently
inuuh put out thereat. Anyhow, the women scored
one.
I thought the revival of “La Masootte,” at
Sydney Lyceum, suffered from being just a soup§on
too blue, though the first act was tolerably free
from the heavenly color. Nellie Stewart wore a
barber’s-pole petticoat, and what passes for rags
in Comic opera (a Masootte’s luck doesn’t seem to
do much for her own wardrobe, by the way) and
looked bewitching, as usual. Nellie S. is one of
those rare actresses who are never seen at a dis-
advantage. Broadside-on, upside-down, or any-
how, she is a vision of delight. Florence Young
cut a fine stage figure as Fiametta, in a green
velvet (purely comic opera) riding-habit with puff-
ball sleeves of pale green satin and a big cavalier
hat with white plumes ; and Mr. Brownlow,
radiantly attired in goatskin, reminded one of the
he-figure in “ Wedded,” oidy that the handsome
W. B. makes love down Nellie Stewart’s back.
By the way, the famous “ Glou Glou ” duet went
splendidly on the first night. Any young couple
with a limited knowledge of the art of canoodling
should make a point of inspecting the Glou Glou
patent before purchasing elsewhere. Though the
words may be only a translation from the French,
the “ business ” certainly isn’t.
Blueness arose in Act 2. The shapely pages
what lovely legs are May Pollard’s—were blue.
T.ipley was blue—his striped doublet gave him
the appearance of a boneless wonder from the
back ; Nellie S.’s white satin dress had a kind of
Masonic apron and collar of blue silk—blue feather
tufts and blue shoes and stockings ; and some of
L uiri Laurent’s jokes even were tinged with tur-
quoise. In that act, if you weren’t blue you had
to be yellow. Vernon and Florence Young re-
sembled a pair of cayenne-pepper-fed canaries,
and when Brownlow changes] his clothing he wore
a white suit slashed with pumpkin-yellow. It
really looked as if the co. hail individually lost
confidence suddenly in its own taste and started
to copy violently. In the last act Nellie
Stewart made a brief, all-too-fleeting appearance
in radish tights of the most long-drawn-out des-
cription (it is corsage revelations Miss Stewart
detests: ‘‘display as much leg as you like but
keep to high-water-mark above the brisket” is
Nellie’s idea of decency) as if to show that there is
no deception, ladies and gentlemen. The act is
played out in a white muslin bridal frock, while
Florence Young looks gorgeous in cactus colors.
Talking of stage dresses, I much regret that,
owing to being in such a wild whirl of drapery, I
put the wrong actress into a pretty frock during the
B. and B. season at .Sydney Lyceum. It was not
Miss Hammond who wore the ‘’cheerfully pretty
pink and blue dress” in the “ Ideal Husband;”
but another of the stage guests—a Miss Mina
Bouohier, an untamed amateur from one of the
Points, who owns the smiling garment in question
and writes to say so. Tuerefore, I have much
pleasure in publicly handing back the lady her
pink and blue vestment with the most contrite
apologies.
I'heinexpressibly pitiable and shameful wrangle
between the alderm n of Junee (N.S. VV.) and
their enterprising Mayor, who is locally in hot
water through ordering a wreath for the late Gov.
Duff’s funeral, se-ins to point the moral that Aus-
Italians rarely do anything unless there’s a blatant
advt. to be got out of it. One of the aforesaid
aldermen put the whole essence of what “ wreaths
and messages of condolence” between people who
don t know each other really mean into his remarks
when he said : “ The wreath was a good advt. for
•Imiee and may bring hundreds to the town.”
How truly expressive of the great grief of a
bereaved “ district ” are those floral tokens from
the Mayor and aldermen of Wayback !
By the way, I hear on all sides that, although
the orders rushed in frantically on the florists for
wreaths, and so on, the same hurry has not always
been observable in the settling-up The aldermen
of Junee are not the only people who try to dodge
the day of reckoning when the hill for their showy
sentimental impulses comes in. But what a sordid
age it is with everything boiled down to the
dimensions of an advt. ; and it’s not only a recent
growth or a passing phase, either. Even the
Soudan contingent, Australia’s greatest exhibition
of unblushing loyalty, was, you remember, openly
and jubilantly referred to as a “big ad.” And
personal a Ivt. has so many phases in Australia.
The E<ty-Marsh combination are in for a 99-
night season “down under,” and will not leave fur
“up above ” until the end of July. Their con-
cert on last Friday evening was very successful.
Miss Esty, in a black gown and a posy of scarlet
flowers an 1 autumn leaves, introduced a brand-
new song to Sydney in Allen’s “S.ftly fell the
Sunshine,” an I was in much better form than on
her first appearance. She sang with more grace
of expression and modulation and a truer intona-
tion! Mr. M irsh, of the stirring quasi-emotional
baritone, is certainly the platform lion of the
moment. Besides his vocal good qualities he has
the gift of in iking friends at once with his
audience, and his encores are simooms. Neither
does Mr. Cunningham escape the encore-fiend, and
M id mi • Enriquez was force 1 to fall back on “Home,
Sweet Ho ne,” in response to the calls which are
long and loud enough when a Sydney audience is
pleased to exhaust the repertoire of a barrel-organ.
By the way, at a concert where front seats are ss.
singers ought to pron mneeit “ ’0 ueSweet ’Ome,”
if they want to be really effective. I didn’t like
Midame Enriquez’s gown—it was too stagey, and
I cannot say that her vocal methods are always
absolutely unirritating. Occasionally Madame
hitches her voice as a stage-sailor hitches his
trousers.
Talking of music, too much fuss cannot be made
over Mr. Arthur D mils, whose benefit concert at
Sydney Town H ill last week was bucli an over*
flowing success, with the Acting-Gov, at tlie mast-
head, tlie Mayor loquitur, and .4)300 in the house, I
am glad to know that Arthur Deane is at last going
'O n') to attain proficiency. He has tlie foundation
of a very mellow and manly baritone voic«, and it
almost goes without saying that the promising
yo ith who leaves for England next month with
his voice in the quartz, so to speak, will return to
us with it pure gold in two or three years time.
Everybody wishes Mr. Deane a great success, not
only for his own sake, but because vocal aspirants
from beside the Beautiful anti-vocal istic Harbor
are so soaroe that we can hardly believe it when
one turns up. Speaking of departing vocalists,
Mr. Willie Walsh, the sweet tenor, who is never
known to fail to come up to the vocal scratch,
shortly shakes the Sydney dust off his feet and
departs for ’Frisco, where he is engaged to appear
at the Tivoli—Tilly Salenger’s happy hunting-
ground.
Dr. Emily Brainerd Ryder M.D.’s jack-o’-
lantern discourse (touching everywhere but guid-
ing you nowhere) “for women only,” in Sydney
Town Hill, on Monday afternoon, must have
keenly disappointed the mob of inquisitive-looking
women who turned up. Dr. Ryder is the direct
opposite of good old Dr. Anna Potts. Not only
because she sports a cap and gown, and rings on
both hands, while Anna P. wore semi evening
dress and a silky little blue feather fan, but be-
cause Dr. Ryder smilingly preaches the cheerful,
if somewhat debateable, doctrine that health is
largely a matter of will—while Dr. Potts, with her
mouth dog-eared at both corners, shook her head
dolefully at tlie eternal feminine and prophesied
unavoidable torments. Of the two, I think lugu-
brious Mrs. Potts would make a bigger success of
the women-only business. For one thing, that
mournful prophetess of evil had a cleverer knack
of introducing the unspeakably cerulean into her
lectures, and there was also a soothing “poor
dear ” air about her ghastly revelations that is
infinitely more welcome to most ladies than Dr.
Ryder’s breezy assertions that women needn’t be
yellow in irtyrs unless they choose. For my part,
I believe in neither of these itinerant medicine-
women. It strikes me as being the funniest thing
in the world to hear a woman “jawing ” off a plat-
form to several hundred pale and weary-looking
fe n des and inviting them, with an airy wave of
her be liamonded hands, tocomeon to the “health
plane”—just as if you achieved mens sam in
cor,/ore sano by taking the first turning to the
right.
Of course, every intelligent human being knows
that we can do a great deal towards our own
general good health by means of diet, careful
clothing, rest, and ail the other slow-coach things
that m ike the elixir of life merely an insipid dose
measured out in a medicine-glass—but for anyone
to assum ■ that we can largely prevent the spread
of disease simp’y by “taking tlie pledge not to
speak of it" is irritating optimism. Though I
supp )se Dr. Rv I t is quite right in preaching the
doctrine of cheerfulness, even if she is somewhat
inconsistent—first encouraging women to think
mure of them wives and less of their hushinds (a
statement which elicited a round of applause that
augured ill, in (thought, for the house-father) and
a moment afterwards congratulating NS.W.
women upon their rosy chance of getting a vote
“ when they will be even more helpful than be-
fore.”
If the accumulated duties of nursing, cooking,
sewing, washing and teaching, which (as Dr.
Rvder points out) are worrying the Australian
married women (it was comforting for spinsters to
hear that all Dr. R.’a warnings were hurled at the
married, by the way) into an early grave, surely
the latter end of women will he worse than the
first, if they ad 1 to these feminine deeds of
domestic daring a determination to poke their
noses into men’s m itters too? Even if women do
get the vote, tlie world will still have to be darned,
washed, fed and taught, and the women will con-
tinue to do most of these duties, although the
following advt. did appear in last Saturday's S.M.

The most depressing part of Dr. R.’s very
’Murkan discourse was when she solemnly advised
you to disbelieve that any disease is incurable
except old age; hut though every doctor had
fallen away exhausted from wrestling with your
case, all you had to do was to place your measles
or whatever it wgs in the hands of Providence and
cheerfully watch your cure working ! At the
close of the lecture, yellow books, going into the
nicest details of tlie Indian child-marriage ques-
tion (Dr. R.’s pet fad), were sold to women only
for one shilling, and so the first “ Health Conver-
sazione” terminated, leaving the audience but
little the wiser. I'll bet. The'ex-President of the
Wo nanhood Suffrage League presided, and a great
number of the Y. W.C. A. and the 1.0.G.T. and
the X. Y.Z., and all the rest of the cold-water and
blue-b illot-p iper brigade swarmed toe hall. One
fat woman who binged approval with her um-
brella whenever the doctor suggested that women
are too domestic nowadays, certainly barracked
for the right side from her point of view. In the
so iiety she adorns the unvarying awfnlness of her
dinners is, I am told, quite unique even in “ ad-
vanced ” circles!
When “ Paul Jones” succeeded “ An Ideal Hus-
band,” at Sydney Lyceum, one Sydney daily re-
marked, in that sublimely well-meaning way which
signifies nothing at all, that “the cleverness and
attract! veness of ‘An Ideal Husband ’ madeitmore
effective commercially than any other production
of the company.” A pretty theory, is it not?
But the real reason why folks Hooked to Oscar
Wilde’s spun-out p ay could scarcely be because of
its cleverness, while an exquisite piece like
“Rebellious Susan” was so poorly attended.
The fact 5 s that Boucicault carefully expunged
Wilde’s name from the bill, but not until everybody
knew who wrote the “ Ideal Hubby;” and Society,
scenting social carrion, rushed the playhouse to
gaze morbidly on a morally-shameless performance
in much the same spirit that the “ outside vulgar”
look at the cup and saucer of some noted criminal
and invest the innocent. d"lf with -A' r '
rible attributes suggested by their exoited imagin-
ations, As some people rush to get a twist of the
rope that hanged a murderer, so Society fell over
itself in its eagerness to discover if, in
the “Ideal Husband,” it might bo able to con-
vict the d irkly-accused dramatist out of his own
month. Because of underlying unsavoriness, the
“Husband ” was B. & B.’s strongest card—and
herein I think I discover a rattling good tip for
Unsuccessful authors.
Yours affectionately.

“La Mascotte " will have finished its
meteoric career at Sydney Lyceum, and the “ Gon-
doliers ” will have taken its place by the time
these few well-chosen remarks reach the public
eye ; and by Saturday the "Gondoliers ” will also
have been succeeded by the “ Mikado,” which will
go off with a sudden razzle-dazzle before The
Bulletin has time to express an enlightened
opinion concerning it. Under these circumstances,
the present observations had better be considered
in the light of ancient history. "La Mascotte”
opened on Saturday to a house that was crowded
in every part, thereby proving that, so long as
Nellie Stewart forms the centre, it doesn’t matter
much what kind of an opera is built around her.
Despite its many attractions, this ancient work
would fall flat with anyone save Our Nellie for its
leading character. The part of Bettina fits her to
perfection. She can make more music out of the
two little wooden shoes than anybody else, and no
one can exhibit the torn frock to more advantage,
or do the famous " Glou Glou ” duet quite so
prettily. Tnis paper’s private opinion is that the
duet in question is drivel, pure and simple, but
when perpetrated by Nellie Stewart it doesn’t
matter whether it is drivel or not. No one else
ever played Bettina with such joyous abandon,
and all through Miss Stewart formed the larger
half of the “Mascotte.” The principal part of
the other half was Lauri, as the miserable and car-
rotty monarch of Fiombino. Howard Vernon’s
Kooco was again hardly up to his old standard.
Brownlovv was in excellent voice, and his son! was
evidently warmed to enthusiasm by the frequent

Acting-Gov, D.irley and a considerable
amount of suite attended Sydney Royal on Mon-

The same well-meaning Deputy-Ex. and a
still larger amount of suite is announced to attend
on Thursday at Her Majesty’s, where the magni-

also dies on the succeeding night. This tendency
on the part of a vigorous and healthy production
to collapse immediately it has been seen by the
Acting-Governor is an eloquent commentary on
the cussed ness of monarchical institutions.

Rickards’new humorist, Horace Wheatley,

Delroy, the “greatest serpentine dancer in the

caught on, and if not the greatest serpent-lady on
earth she is at least sufficiently great for all
ordinary purposes. The champion bone soloist
made his first appearance on the same evening,
and people who liked bone soloists, and who
knew what a Hone soloist really ought to be,
seemed to approve of him cordially. For the rest,
Larry Duoley is still on hand, and Janies N A ie,

A new company, managed by Cosgrove

O’Brien in Australia, though several people have
endeavoured to be another, and have failed miser-
ably—the worst failure of the lot being six feet of
misery which attempted the character for one
consecutive night some years ago, supported by a
terrified looking girl in a drab frock. The next
worst failure was a haggard person who never
smiled, either then or afterwards. In consequence
of these and other failures the public as a whole
disbelieves in any Widow except the original
Sheridan. These remarks, however, are not in-
tended to discourage, but only to warn, the new
company.

“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly tunny and
rollicking Irish song of flic Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lanri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Foliar! Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E Hat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing tor an aspir-

“ A Gaiety Girl,” at Melb. Princess’s, still
bewitches a host of nightly admirers. At the
same time the public are by no means unanimous
as to the merits of the production. Naturally,
the phases of British fashionable life which
are so scathingly satirised are unfamiliar, on
the whole, to Australian audiences, and for
this the unobtrusiveness of the mounting
and the dressing fails to fully compensate.
To those who do “catch on,’’ however,
the “Gaiety Girl ” is wholly delightful. The
adorable Miss Maud Hobson divides honors as
first favorite with Miss Grace Palotta, the charm-
ing French maid. The worldly-wise Dr. Brierly
(Harry Monkhouse) also grows on public approval,
as well as that gay old dog, Major Barclay
(Fred. Kaye). Miss Madge Rossell’s dance in the
first act is a revelation, and always in short
supply. The musical burlesque, “In Town,’’ will
be put on for the first time on Saturday evening.

At Melb. Royal, the “ Span of Life ” con-

Crowded houses assemble nightly to denounce the

Cecil eats his poisoned grapes to the accompani-

Walter Baker still bears himself gallantly through
the four acts, and, from the moment he rings the
lighthouse bell, inspires an undying (it hopeless)
passion in the bosom of many fair ones. Like-
wise, he fills many manly hearts with deadly hate
when he imprints burning kisses on the sweet lips
of Miss Hilda Spong. The nightly enthusiasm
culminates with the Living Bridge. Nobody
seems to tire of the Living Bridge, and quite a
number of Melbourne youths have sprained them-
selves badly while reproducing this sensation in
the domestic back-yard.

The rather sensational exit of the Dacres,
at Melb. Bijou, Arthur Dacre coming before the
curtain to impeach theniianagement with numer-
ous sins of omission and commission (but
notably the former) was the most exciting event
of the nine weeks’ season. Rumor had prepared
the public for some unpleasant disclosures, and
they got even more disclosures than they expected.
Circumstances and internal dissensions and
muddlement have been against the Dacres ever
since they left England. “The Wife’s Ordeal”
seriously damped the enthusiasm which had been
worked up on Miss Roselle’s behalf, and thus the
season was practically wrecked almost as soon
as it started. The Dacres will probably be taken
up shortly by a Sydney manager. Meanwhile,
Melb. is working up a benefit as a tribute to the
sterling artistic merits of Miss Amy Roselle.

The remarks of J tidge Mol ••‘■■worth, of Melh.
Insolvency Court, as to the poliliciuly-dependeut condi-
tion of the Vic. minor Bench, should cause the com-
munily to-insist (Tub Bulletin lias constantly tinted this
for years past) that all Judges and Magistrates be placed
on the aime footing as the Supreme Court Bench. The
spectacle of a political head of a dept, which embraces
Judges and Magistrates amongst its officers, awakens
thought of what might occur if the head strained his
power. Recent events should induce the Legislature to
place the fount of justice beyond even suspicion of con-
tamination. The fact of the junior partner of a police-
court firm being Premier of the province opens one’s eyes
to the possibilities of the future. At present we see
the Premier acting as solicitor for a firm cast in heavy
damages for serious trade frauds ; the Attorney-General
acting as a counsel, having drawn the pleadings ; and,
iater on, these, io their political sphere, will be deciding
the question of mimical action against these people!!
F r rtunat -ly, Judge Molesworth, having a large private
fortune, is free from any pressure that might h placed
on one less wealthy, and it is to lie hoped that the
public will rake up the matter warmly. The corrup-
tion of the Vic. honorary justices’ bench is, and has been
for many years, notorious. Let the Victorian people lake
all precaution that the gangrene does not extend boa

The National Bank of Australasia (like the
Colonial and the City of Melbourne) presents a balance-
sheet which is many degrees worse than its last one.
Apparently the past six months have been the worst time
the Melh. hanks have vet experienced. Tire National is
an institution of high repute and no suspicion is
entertained concerning its soundness, but, its latest
figures are not cheering. For the three preceding half-
years it made net profits of t'2s 300, £31,000, a d
£25,230 respectively, making the excellent total of nearly
£‘82,000 in 18 months of hard d pression. A'd of this
amount it deliberately fooled away nearly 1 72,000 in divi-
dends, mil to >k no'thought for the. morrow. The Bul-
letin denounced each one of these divs as an act of
f'lllv, especially as a large proportion of the reconstruc-
tion expenses were held over in order to pan t'i -m a ct if
sees no reason to alter its opinion. The net profits fo
the half-year Just ended are only £15,120—a falling-off of
£lO,OOO as compared with last half. Of this t7Bao goes
to pay the balance of reconstruction expenses, which
should have been extinguished before any division of
profits was made, and a 5 per cent, dividend on
preference shares absorbs all the rest and also
maxes it necessary to lake £3OO from profit and
loss account.' The ordinary shares, after receiving three
dividends on a steadily declining scale of 4J per cent., 4
percent, and 2J per cent., now recehe notiuiig at all.
Still the National, true to its former policy, “ blevvs ” all
the profits it has and takes no thought for the morrow. A
wiser directorate would have passed the dividend
altogether.
In every other respect the National looks ex-
ceedingly solid. Last ha f-ye ir s enormous cash balance of
£1,573,000 has increased to £1,655,000, which is altogether
too much cash to keep lying idle, though it represents a
lot of reserve strength. The item, “ Government deben-
tures,” has increased in the six months from £601,000 to
£70>,000, and if the management could see iis way to
invest another half-mdhmi in this direct on, and thereby
earn another £15,000 or more per annum tor the share-
holders, or else pay off half a mdlion of fixed deposits, it
would do a good turn to the institution. The ordinary
business is evidently improving, the bank having got no
less than £2,111,000 of deposits since its suspension. And,
in addition, it has a reserve-fund of £lOO,OOO. It the
board will only mitigate its hunger after dividends and
huge cash balances, all promises to be well.
♦ • • *
The Colonial Bank of Australia follows the ex-
ample set by the City of Melbourne, and intends aban-
doning the hopeless struggle to pay 4£ per cent, interest
to its reconstructed depositors. An appeal is therefore to
be made for a reduction—probably to 3 per cent. The
reasons for this painful proceeding are sufficiently evi-
denced by the balance-sheet, which shows the same pro-
cess of fading away which has distinguished the other
ill-fated reconstruct aDove-mentioued. for the half-year
ended March, ’94, the Colonial made a net profit of £7353.
The half ended September, ’94, showed a net profit of only
£2246. Last six months shows a net loss of £4694—and
this despite a great reduction in working expenses and a
considerable increase of capital. The gross profits have
dropp-d from £40,000 a year ago to £lB,OOO. The Colonial
has written off its reserve-fund of £309,000, and, when the
Companies Act has been refixed, it proposes to write off a
portion of its capital—how much doesn’t 3 7 et appear. In
the first year after reconstruction it fooled away £ll,OOO in
paying two ghostly little diva. on preference shares, which
proceeding Tub Bulletin declared to be unjustifiable and
ridiculous. As the event proves, it was worse than ridicu-
lous. The div. wasn't earned in any legitimate sense : it
was simply arrived at by,-omitting to provide for
impending losses. The big dailies, however, professed
to regard these dividends as a sign of returning prosperity.
The Colonial has .£12,000 less note-circulation
than it had a year ago ; £32,000 less bills in circulation ;
£220,000 less deposits ; £130,000 less cash ; and £4OOO
less Government debentures—all signs of a steady shrink-
age in business. It is a good deal further away from any
prospect of paying iff its reconstructed deposits when
they fall due than it seemed to be 18 months ago. The
paid-up ordinary capital, too, is only £500,000, which
leaves no very large margin for writing otf, and the
exceeding feebleness of its shares and deposits on the
market shows that the public views it with a great lack
of enthusiasm. Still, if the deposit interest cache reduced
to (say) 3 per cent., the saving will be something between
£25,000 and £30,000 per annum, and with such a load
lifted off its shoulders even a very weak hank ought to
have a fair chance of recovery, always provided the de-
cline in business doesn't go on b definitely. How the
depositors feel on the subject.is,a different matter. These
luckless individuals already lose £13,500 per annum by
the conversion of part of their interest-hearing deposits
into preference shares, which pay no div., and are not
likely to pay any f)r long to come. If the interest on the
balance is reduced to 3 per cent., their total loss will be
some £4O 000 a year. It is a lovely thing to be a recon-
structed depositor.
* * * »
The City of Melbourne Bankvdirectors reports
joyously that “ the liquidation of the old hank has been
completed.” The same directors report that owing to-
the stagnation of the real estate market they can’t tell
the value of many of the old bank’s assets, and that they
are waiting for an amendment of the Companies Act to
enable them to write off a lot of capital to cover the old
bank’s losses—amount of losses not yet fully ascertained.
Under these circumstances bow is the liquidation com-
pleted ? Apparently the old bank lias simply been
shovelled bodily into the new one without any liquidation
at all.

According to the latest returns, the Queensland
Government has now a small trifle of £4,300,000 in the
Q.N. Bank, less than half of it being “fixed” and the
rest (about £2,220,000) nominally free. Also, it has
£215,000 in other banks. Yet the Govt, professes itself
unable to pay off £1.100,000 of treasury bills falling due
next year without floating a new loan ! The Q.N. Bank,
by the way, only professes to hold £1,500,000 in coin and
notes, including its assets in London, so perhaps the
Govt, isn’t such an ass as it looks, after all.

The ridiculous ease with which a big re-

by discounting with a careless bank almost any

its papers. One or two clever mep, if jointly employed

Truth in mining, when unsatisfactory, is very

J. B. Jacqu-t, N.S.W. geologist-surveyor, reports that
the rich ore in Mt. Drysdale thinned out and terminated
at 160 ft., and the last. 100 tons sent to Queensland only
yielded lOdwts. per ton. The ore occurs in three shoots,
separated by m isses of barren rock. He thinks it p >ssihle
that the ore-body may lie picked up lower down but below
tile zone of oxidation ; it will probably contain less gold
and be more difficult to treat. Yet for months after the
fact was established Ihe public were told that the mine
was “as rich as ever.” The press is the medium of the

Queen’s Birthday mine, Dnnolly (Yin.), which
lately recommenced with such a flourish of trumpets,
must be in a had way. A large number of men were
engaged and, after working a couple of months, found
that the English capital to pay them was not forth-
coming; so work has again been stopped, • with about
£5OO owing to the mmeis. The whole of the plant,

Murchison, W. A., for th” half-year Just ended is about

another 5329 away on other mines owned by it.
Considering the heavy charges of transit from the coast,
the excessive cost of timber (£1172 for the half-year) and
high rate of wages ruling, the Day Dawn is considered to
have undergone a very severe test. Avenge yield has
increased from I2dwt,s. to 15 dwts, per ton ; tailings are

The splendid success of Harris’Reward mine at
Mount .bikes, Tas., has stimulated the flotation of the Mt.
Jukes Proprietary to work adjoining and 'djacent ground.
Thi« co. has secured no less than 140 acres of ground, in-
cluding several blocks directly on the line of Harris’ reef,
which carries gold into one‘of them. If the gold goes
down, and there is plenty of stone, such an acreage should

In whatever direction the bias of the
Sydney police may lie with respect to the Dean
case, it is plain, from confidential information
which has reached The Bulletin from a well-in-
formed Victorian quarter, that tho Melbourne
detectives are by no means in love with the Sydney
Crown Law Office theories. It would appear that
in the Dean case history is likely to repeat itself,
somewhat on the lines of the startling Biittner
case. The condamne in the latter case, by the
way. owed his life to the Brisbane detectives’
enquiries.
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION,
It has long been known to scientists' that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists lias been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby's Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may he had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Mr. T. J. Santety, Murrumburrah, who writes on
June 13th, 1893 About four months ago I was
greatly troubled with a continued languid feeling,
also loss of appetite, costiveness ; in fact, I felt
myself hardly capable of carrying on my usual
business, owing to a tired feeling ; I awoke in the
morning more unrefreshed than when I went to
bed. A friend of mine, who was boarding in the
same house as me, who had been benefited by
taking Clements Tonic for the above symptoms,
advised me to try it. I did so, and am happy to
say that before I had finished the third bottle all
disagreeable symptoms had disappeared. I am
happy to say I have never had any occasion to
take any medicine since. I consider it is one of
the greatest panaceas in the world to those suffer-
ing from indigestion or affection of the liver.
Thanking you for the great benefit I have derived
from the use of your wonderful Clements Tonic.
I remain, yours, &c., T. J. Santety, tailor, Albury-
street, Murrumburrah.

and the vast power of tue machinery of
the law runs to waste, and salaries of
the Judges, associates, policemen, and

costs swell visibly, and the wear and tear

Duffy call e; ch other names, and per-

they have fought fifteen hard rounds in

Ex-Reverend Tate, a South Sea Island

the property to a figure that placed it within

The N.S. W. Parliamentary question about
swearing, aimed at the wicked and downright
General Hutton, looks like a shaft from a feminine
bow. In certain society circles, the General is
hated with a hate unspeakable. He is always at
work and keeps other people at work, which
doesn’t suit the whisky-and-soda brigade—the
people with hob-nail livers and parchment kid-
neys who, ere the General’s advent, did nothing
but draw their fatted sa'aries.
In Basil Thomson’s book on Tonga, Rev.
Shirley Baker is thus immortalised: “Three
natives were indicted for stealing a pig. Two had
agreed to watch while the third stole.” “This,”
said the autocratic Baker, in his judicial function,
“ was no ordinary theft—it was conspiracy.” He
found his law-book defined conspiracy as a
synonym for treason, and the punishment for
treason was up to 20 years. Accordingly, the
prisoners were found guilty of treason.
Ex-Premier Parkes, says Sydney Sunday
Times, is collecting his letters for publication,
having kept a copy of almost every letter he ever
wrote. The Bulletin hopes to see in the collec-
tion the letters written by H. Parkes to the liar
who invented the Kiatna Ghost, and who, having
had large expenses paid for him by an enquir-
ing and patriotic government, at last refused to
give any more information, on the ground that the
Parkes Government didn’t address him as So-and-
So, “Esquire.”
Melbourne Argus remarks that “Phil
May developed his talent in Australia, although
he was not born here,” but the conscienceless rag
doesn’t mention that May’s ta'ent was monopolised
by The Bulletin during the development a'ore-
said. This is petty. In the'same paragraph the
Argus Writer refers to Perey Spence as an artist,
whose work,apart from the frontispiece hedesigne i
for the Antipodean, is not familiar to Victorians.
This is a cold-blooded lie. Spence’s drawings for
The Bulletin have been seen and admired by
thousands of Victorians for years past. For every
man who remembers the Antipodean frontispiece
there are a thousand who know the artist by his
contributions to this journal.
Many years ago the writer heard the late
Charles Badham, then Professor of Classics in
Sydney University, deliver an address. The
occasion has slipped his over-burdened memory,
but three sentences of the address have never
ceased to tingle through his brain. “If any
young man in this assembly,” said Prof. Badham,
“ has embarked his life in pursuit of knowledge,
let him go on without doubting or fearing the
event. Let him not be intimidated by the cheer-
less beginnings of knowledge, by the dark-
ness from which she springs, by the diffi-
culties which have surrounded her, by those
wretched habitations in which she dwells, by the
want and sorrow which sometimes journey in her
train; but let him ever follow her as the angel
that guards him, and as the genius of his life.
She will bring him out at last into the light of
day, and exhibit him to the world comprehensive in
acquirements, fertile in resources, rich in imagina-
tion, strong in reasoning, prudent and peaceful
above his fellows in all the relations and in all the
offices of life.” The speaker of those eloquent
words has long lain in his grave, but his spirit is
still a source of inspiration, and his family hand
down not unworthily the traditions of his lofty
talent. Mr. Charles Badham, his son, is P.M. at
Carcoar, N.S.W. Miss Edith Anesley Badham
(whose portrait appears in this week’s Bulletin)
is a clever University coach, and the author of
the very able and remarkable paper on Woman’s
Suffrage read at the last meeting of N.S. Wales
Economic Association. Another son, Dr. Bad-
ham, is studying bacteriology at the Pasteur In-
stitute, but will probably return to Australia this
year. Miss Julia Badham (the youngest of the
family) is a trained nurse, residing at Mosman’s
Bay, near Sydney, with her sister and her mother,
Mrs. Chas. Badham.
Recently at Maryborough (Vic.) the daugh-
ter of ex-Mines-Minister Outtrim was married,
and the cacchinatory Chief Secretary Peacock,
always young-looking, w ho was among the guests,
looked more youthful still when attired in full fig.
When he took up the pen to sign as a witness, the
clergyman called him aside and (not knowing him)
said, “ Pardon me, but it is usual for witnesses at
weddings to he over 21. Have you reached that
age?” To use Peacock’s own words —“I let one
laugh out that nearly lifted him off his feet.”
Messengers frequently cm me to Vic. Premier
Turner while in Court on the Greener case. Some
were from the Treasury and some were not. The
other day a fussy little man forced his way
through the crowd and laid a paper before the
Premier. It might have been a declaration of
war from S. Austra.ia over the disputed boundary,
or anything big and national. But it only con-
cerned a small insolvent-boomer’s estate, and it
was all the same to Turner. He wrote his opinion
across the back, and would have done the same
during a want-of-confidence debate.
Thus a London paper :
In the midst of the battle of flowers, yacht-racing and
the world of gaiety at Cannes, there occurred a sad death
in the district of Theonle of a man well-known and
greatly respected both in the colonies and the mother-
country. Mr. Randolph C. Want was an Amdo-Aiislra-
lian lawyer, who may he described as the legal-advis r in
London for Australasia. His office in Victoiia-slreit
being near all the Agents Gem ral and otln is countoted
with the colonies, brought him and his partner into daily
communication with them. Mr. Want to' k high honois
at the University of Sidney, Ids i alive town. Besid s
being a good linguist, he exodl.d in painting, sculp:(ire
and music, and was, in fact, one of the most ac. ompiisln d
Australians domiciled in this country. His (hath hat

circle of admiring friends, including many golf' rs .J

ceptional capacity for business of nil kinds, lie had an
engaging and kindly manner which made him universally
popular. His magnificent presence was a fit embodiment
of hia large heart and generous ti mper.
Meston has written another little book
about the poor blacks, and dedicated it under the
stimulus of fellow-feeling to ‘‘the Honorable
Horace Tozer, Colonial Secretary of Queensland ’
—George Washington being unavailable. 'The
little book collects a lot of interesting information,
and comes to a climax at p. 30, win re it is pointed
out that a Protector of Aborigines should be at
once appointed by Govt. According to Meston,
it is “absolutely essential” that the Protector
“shall possess (1) a know], dge of aboriginal
character and customs (2) “ a naturally kind
disposition and great firmness and decision of
character;” (3) “a strong physique.” All other
varieties of Protector are bogus. And these con-

ditions unluckily vitiate the whole scheme, for
The Bulletin knows nobody but Meston himself
who complies with them ; and, though he fills the
bill, he would, of course, decline to fill the billet.
So the blacks must apparently continue to die off
and jump up whitefellow in the good old pre-
Mestonian way.

The sugar-industry progresses in Queens-
land. Govt, is calling tenders for a new lazarette.
Brisbane Courier has been advised to
place its leper-paragraphs under the beading of
“Our Industries.”
A parson writes to the Brisbane papers
advocating a close season for Kanakas. It should
be made to apply to the missionaries also.
Memo, for clever, but unlearned, R. E.
O’Connor: There was neither gallows nor “cat”
in Ireland while that country was ruled by Celts.
A delicate question now frequently asked
on the Freetrade side of N.S.W. Assembly is:
How will Adrian Knox vote on the sugar branch
of the tariff reform ?
“I am growing old and grey-haired look-
ing for work for others, and now I’m beginning
to think it’s time to look for some for myself.”
“ Billy ” Maloney, M.P.
Gov. Robinson’s suggestion that the
Westralian grant to the aborigines should be
placed on the same footing as the Governor’s
salary is an undeserved insult to the aborigines.
A gloss on N.S.W. Civil Service Commis-
sion’s report re the inefficiency of State audit is
supplied by the officer who is asserted to have just
admitted an account shortage of approximately
32250.
Should Premier Turner’s health break
down within the next month or two, it is believed
that either Isaacs, Best, or Deakin would succeed
him. Peacock, however, is regarded as a rapidly

Tozer and Byrnes are the two rival

neither will get either.
Four successive cablegram headings in last

Truly this is the Great Loan Land.
The feeling against H. H. Champion at
Melb. Trades Hall is confined to a few members,
led by Hancock and Prendergast. Champion
says he intends to fix himself in Victoria, and to

The trustees of Collins-street Independent
Church, Melb., are being sued for obstructing
neighbors’ air and light with certain church struc-

held to be illegal, what church is safe?
The N.S.W. military authorities are ac-
tively working up the .Japanese scare. The
beer-barrels used as artillery-targets at South
Head the other day were made to represent “ the
Japanese warships Naniwa and Yoshina.”
Montgomery and Williams struck fran-
tically for escape,and were hanged for “attempted
murder;” whereas the man who, the other day,
deliberately walked up to another and fractured
his skull with a bottle, is charged only with “in-

user hadn’t been meddling with holy “ property ”
wliich makes all the difference !
Varney Parkes’ pamphlet on the Public
Works Committee, and his father’s on G.
H. Reid, so far afford no encouragement in
the financial sense to men of letters to enter
the field of political pamphleteering. “ The
Reid fraud” seems to pay better than the
write fraud.
There are two classes of politicians—
the'burly and the burley. Parkes and Bibbs
are.baokboneful and burly : Reid is spine-
less and burley. Burley is the stuff
you throw to black-bream, to make
them come round and bite. Reid is
always burleying the political black-
bream ground.

Two months ago N.S. W. Colonial Secre-

The Argus on Morris’s dainty handling of
George Higinbotham’s democracy:—“Professor

The new N.S.W. Crown Lands Act has
passed both Houses of Parliament. Now the

Vic. Premier Turner has ordered that
future Civil Service appointments shall be on
monthly agreements, that there shall be no per-
manency, express or implied, and consequently
no compensation for loss of employment, and no
lairn for pension.
What does Ren wick’s expensive report of
the Chicago Exhibition mean? Listen to W. B.
Dailey on an analogous occasion : “It means a
most shameful extravagance of public money in
printing the memorials of Jones’s audacious ignor-
ance and intolerable self-sufficiency.”
Sydney D.T. : “There has never been a
case in which payment of members once sanc-
tioned has ever been abolished.” What about
England? Again: “Parliament may cut down
people’s salaries, but its own are always held
sacred.” What about Victoria and Queensland ?
The S.M. Herald objects to one-half, or
less than one-half, of the Assembly, at a late hour
of the night, when the Labor element prepon-
derates, passing Bills ; but it never objects to
one-half of the Council shelving or repealing Bills,
and less than one-half is . the normal constitution
of that body.
Spasm from Melb. Herald :
See and be proud of those men in the procession. Stal-
wart, well-dressed, happy-looking, erect, filled with the
glorious sense of manliness which is one of the happiest
products of this favored land.
As a matter of fact, the last was the most solemn
Eight-Hours procession Melbourne has seen. The
grim representation of a sweater’s den lent color
to the whole show, and never a cheer was heard
along the line of march. Looking on, one felt
that the funerals of the six men fished from the
Spottiswoode sewer would not have been out of
place at the heels of the army of labor. “The
glorious sense of manliness ” does not come out
strong on “ four bob a day,”
The Boodlewraifch has just ordered a
trial survey of the Hnghenden-Winton railway.
This will be a faial blow to Rockhampton supre-
macy. Most of tlie trade of the Hughenden-
Winton district at present drifts down to the
capital of Oentralia, and the proposed railway will
infallibly divert it to Townsville. Such is the
reward of fidelity to the hated Southern Govern-
ment.
The first arbitration carried out by the
State Board of Conciliation in Adelaide ended
ineffectually. The tanners’ dispute was en-
quired into and a unanimous finding by the Presi-
dent and the representatives of employers and
workmen was arrived at, the process being a
judicious distribution of blame among both parties
to the trouble. No tangible benefit resulted to
anyone.
Some of the Queensland papers anticipate
a big difficulty through Japanese immigration,
and say that Japan will not submit to anything
in the way of a poll-tax on her people. One paper
describes the Australian militia as “poorly-trained,
ill-disciplined, and armed with obsolete weapons,”
and reckons that Japan could —without British
intervention —run right over Australia if a war
took place.
A PARTIALLY NEW WOMAN.
VISITOR : “ And so yon are one of those horrid ‘ New II omen ?
WIDOW : " Well, dear, not exactly new —you see, a widow must always be somewhat
SECOND-HAND.”
In connection with N.S.W. Education
Minister Garrard’s school-age relapse from six
years to five, it is worth noting that of the 4J
United States and Territories six admit children
to the public schools at four years minimum, 1J
at five, 20 at six, three at seven, and one at eight.
In reply to the Trades Hall condemnation,
H H Champion writes in the AItGUS : “ I have
in no respect changed my mind with regard to the
action I took in ’9O {re the maritime strike).
Events have fully borne out my description ot the
Vic. working men as lF an army of lions led by
asses.”
N.S. W. population, Dec. 31, ‘94 : 672,950
males, 578,500 females ; total, 1,251.450. Sydney
and suburbs: 214,110 males, 209,490 females; total,
423,600 —or oue-third of the population of the pro-
vince. And this is only the first of non-produc-
ing handicaps on country producers. When bor-
rowing stops, if ever, on whom will the apex-
balanoed pyramid fall?

INSOLVENCY ITEM.
“Insolvent stated that she was a widow, and her estate was compulsorily
sequestrated on 8th Now. last. Her husband died in 86. They did not
divide the profits at all. They kept no hooks except to show the sales and
purchases. She had very little to do with the business. They only drew
out of the business house expenses and the hoys’ pocket-money. Each of
her sons took whatever money he liked, and so did she for maintenance
purposes, but no record was kept of the drawing of any of them, There
were no means of finding out even approximately the amount of those draw-
ings—not even an idea roughly. Whichever of them wanted to draw
money just went to the till and took whatever was wanted.”—Melb[?]ne
law-report.
Unless the N.S.W. Ministry walks circum-
spectly, it will find itself out of office over the
Dean case. What may smash it is not any want
of p'lability on the part of Premier Reid, for he
is a jelly-fish politician, into whom you can stick
a knife without either drawing blood or making a
subsequeutly-visible hole. The trouble may an-e
out of the fact that Attorney-General Want has
a backbone,” and will have no truck with popu-
lar clamour.”
In the Western district (Vic.) the muni-
cipalities which control local taxation are all
governed hy squatters. In Hampden shire seven
out of the nine councillors are squatters. The
Heyteshury forest is unrepresented. The pick of
the country held by the squatters is assessed at
3d. an acre ; the dense forest, where the selector
has been dumped, at 2s. 6d. an acre.
Same old gag !
Says Rev. Haw-
Haweis : “ Though
they are termed
Americans, they are
still the Anglo-Saxon
race, speaking the
same tongue.” The
alleged Anglo-Saxon
—himself a delightful
hybridisation of
Briton, Celt, Frisian,
Scandinavian, and
Latin —furnishes, per-
haps, one of a people
the balance of which
is Irish, German,
Swedish, French,
Spanish, Chinaman,
nigger. et-20-ceUra,
and which speaks —
when it isn’t jabber-
ing the lingoes of its
numerous native lands
—a tongue that is no
more English than
Dutch is German or
Portuguese Spanish,
In which tongue,
moreover, it is never
tired of cursing the
Englishman and all
his works, and repu-
diating from the bot-
tom of its stomach
the weary old wheezes
that it is a division of
the “great Anglo-
Saxon race,” that
there is any Anglo-
Saxon race, and that'
there is any special
“ greatness ” about
the race which is so
called. And if there
are any Yanks who do
speak English, they
think in American.
The Yic. Gover-
nor’s salary was in ’62
unanimously reduced
from =£lo,ooo and
£5OOO allowances to
£7OOO without allow-
ances. Thereupon
Gov. Barkly resigned.
The Bill was, 1 ow-
ever, refused Royal
assent, and the Gover-
nor’s resignation was
not accepted. The
leaaons given were—
first, that the reduc-
tion was too great ;
second, that the
c ange should not be
made to apply to the
current Governor, as
if the Gov.’s salary
once became uncer-
tain it might at any
time be cut down
arbitrarily by a Minis-
try whom H.E. did not please. Finally, the matter
was settled by the reduction to .£lO,OOO, minus all
allowances.
The Higinbotham-edited Argus utterance
on capital punishment is thus stated in Prof
Morris’s biography :
We are convinced that the abolition of capital punish-
ment should at least be tried, were it only for a time. It
would be easy to revert to barbarism should amelioration
appear to be premature. —December 10, 1858,
“This view,” Mr. Morris asserts, “ later j experi'
ence caused Mr. Higinbotham to change.” Only
that, and, in the following 250 pages, nothing
more 1 But how could anything change such an
unimpeachable and carefully-expressed philoso-
phical suggestion?

The Bulletin desires to caution people
Against publicly giving cheers for Dean, convicted
of poisoning, but generally believed to be guilt-
less. It would be much safer, as a vent for enthu-
siasm, to give groans for the system of hurried
trial. Cocksureti'-ss with regard to Dean’s inno-
cence might -suddenly result as awkwardly for
Dean and his partisans as revelations in an oppo-
site direction for the Judge who so loudly declared
his certainty of the man’s guilt. Dean may be
innocent or he may be guilty ; and, so far, there is
more reason for believing him innocent than
guilty. But the only things absolutely certain in
regard to Dean are that he had not a fair trial,
and that the evidence on which he was convicted
is not, looked at dispassionately, good enough to
hang a mangy dog.
By the way, why doesn’t Judge Windeyer
arrange another M lion seance, and ask “ Geordie”
or “ Cissy ” whether Dean really did it or not.
The spooks must know all about it. Perhaps it
was a spook dropped the arsenic in.
The support accorded (on this and other
memorable occasions) to Mr. Justice Windeyer’s
peculiar methods by his friend, the S.M. Herald,
in no wise balances the severe and almost un-
measured condemnation of the Argus and the
general press of Australasia. Nor do the anony-
mous letters, composed chiefly of typically
Heraldic suppressions and perversions of the
truth, with a strong admixture of downright im-
pudent lies, tend to bolster up the case on behalf
of His Honor. The protracted and wide-spread
discussion over this matter must be peculiarly
agonising to several people. In a case where a
man is hanged by a “backbone ” Ministry in de-
fiance of public opinion, and, it may be (it has
often been) of every principle of justice, the public
tumult usually ceases with the pulling of the bolt.
But the unhanged George Dean and his long-
drawn-out case seem to have been specially devised
for the purpose of destroying the good old Botany
Bay method of conducting capital trials.
Everywhere in this world amour propre is a
strong factor. How terribly awkward it would be
for the Judge, after his gratuitous declaration
that he was as sure Dean poisoned his wife as if
he had seen him in the act, were it to be con-
clusively shown that Dean’s was not the hand
which did the deed ! To err is human, but judges
of the Supreme Court, in their official capacity at
least, are not supposed to be as human as other
people. How his Honor’s nerves would be on the
rack if he knew that there was an absolute cer-
tainty of the North Shore mystery, for mystery it
is, being made clear (not clairvoyantly clear, or
Mellunically clear) in the sight of all men!
The Bulletin dreamt some nights ago that it
was the head of the detective-force, and met His
Honor in the street after it had absolutely solved
the problem. “Your Honor,” said this paper,
preserving a sphinx-like face, “it is now known
for certain where the poison came from and who
administered it.” His Honor tried hard to control
his emotions, but his eyes almost started out of
his head with excitement. “ What about it?” he
snapped. “Ah, your Honor,” replied theemotion-
less head of the detective-force, “ that is my busi-
ness for the present.” And then His Honor went
off to stew in his own gravy.
That the Dean case will yet be thoroughly re-
viewed there can be no manner of doubt. And
the most interesting part of the new hearing,
whatever form it takes, will (provided no
arsenic is meanwhile traced to prisoner’s posses-
sion) be the medical evidence. The most intelli-
gent of tbe profession seem unanimous in the
opinion that, whatever Mrs, Dean’s present condi-
tion, there never was even a reasonably-conclusive
prima-facie case against the accused.
• * •
The foreman of the jury in the Dean case
hardly deserves all the obloquy that has been
heaped upon him. His wife was only confined a
day or two before the trial, and his eldest son
underwent a critical surgical operation, which re-
sulted fatally, while he was actually in the
jury-box. It is not to be supposed that any man
would, under the circumstances, be able to calmly
weigh evidence or patiently view the prospect of
being further locked up for two nights and a day.
Under such circumstances, hurried verdicts,
founded on illogical compromises, are not to be
wondered at.
• « •
The attitude of Windeyer, J., and the
verdict of the jury, in the Dean trial, like the
phenomena lately produced by the spiritualist ;
medium, Mrs. Mellon, in the presence of his
Honor, are, to quote the words of the report
signed by Windeyer, J., aforesaid, as a member of
the manifestations-investigation committee, “ im-
possible to account for by any of the known laws
of Nature, as at present understood.”
• * «
Pearl of wisdom by J. Hogue, M.P. (N.S.
Wales:—“lf he (Dean) had attempted to poison the
mother-m-law we could have understood it, and
there would have been some rational theory to
base his guilt upon. But that he should poison
his own wife. ...” A man ought usually to
begin with his mother-in-law, anyhow, though
there may sometimes be arguments in favor of
practising on your wife so as to make quite sure of
her ma afterwards.

The Dean case reminds The Bulletin
roundaboutly of the (Victorian) Spoarin case.
Dear Bulletin, — Is it not a fact (tet
toxicological experts say) that habitual arsenic-
eaters—and there are many females who take
arsenic regularly in order to achieve a fat,
pasty, fair complexion—can take what are to
others poisonous doses daily without apparent
ill results; until, suddenly, at some other weak
turn of health, and especially if they cease the
daily dose they suddenly exhibit severe symptoms
of arsenical poisoning?— DlPSO.

Aii ancient Sydney landmark has just
disappeared—the Phillip-street oak. It was grown
from an acorn brought from Essex by a “patriot”
named Solomon, who planted it in 1801. The
pulling-down of the house in front of which the
tree stood necessitated its uprooting. The house
in question was built by “Dicky” Driver’s
grandfather in 1798, of the real, original “ Brick-
fields’’clay. There Dicky’s father was born and
lived till he went into the old pub., famous in
Sydney annals, at King-street corner. The
site of the cottage at this date is about
the only spot anywhere near the centre of
Sydney where the original conformation of the
ground can be seen. The preservation of the
tree for so long after it encroached upon the
footpath was due to a regard for it on the part of
Mr. John Starkey, owner of the adjacent pro-
perty, who must have paid pretty dearly for his
sentiment in the loss of rent. The oak is shown
in a drawing of Sydney of 1810 as a sapling. It
was at one time used as a watch-post—the limit
of the patrolmen’s beat—and a company of
soldiers marching to St. James’ one Sunday in
1815, along what was then the ridge of the road,
was bogged opposite to it. The men were told
“ to break ranks ” and “form by the tree,” when
it was seen that several had left their shoes in the
mud. Colonel Molle, “the domineering brute”
of Wentworth’s satire, was present, and sent the
men to church shoeless.

S.A. teetotallers are indignant over “Sir
Buxton’s” appointment as Governor. The
Southern Baptist, an Adelaide sheet, describes
him as coming from a family “made by beer.”
“ How can we associate with a man,” says a
prominent Ad. teetotaller, “ who made his money
out of the blood of thousands of the poorer
classes?”
There are two Adelaide citizens who know Gov.
Buxton “well,” but they differ in description.
One describes him as “a tall, thin man, with
mutton-chop whiskers,” and another has limned
him as “of medium height, stout, dignified
demeanor, and with a magnificent beard.” When
Buxton arrives he will probably turn out to be a
pompous little man, sft. high, with a balloon-like
stomach, and the usual evangelical upper-lip.

Lord Brassey is described by a Melbourne
Herald correspondent as a very unattractive
speaker. “He is the great antithesis of the light
and graceful style of Lord Hopetoun.” Hardlyas
bad as that, surely ; but The Bulletin rejoices to
know that Melbourne banquet-snappers and
bibulous dead-heads will, in future, have to suffer
more and more for their iniquities. One hopes
“the groaning bored ” will be a literally correct
expression in the journalistic reports of future
State gorges and guzzles in the marvellous city.

One of the presents to Swilliam Clarke’s

In one week Chief Justice Griffith in the
South and Judge Noel in the North of Queensland
told juries that they were scandals to the adminis-
tration of law. In one case the jury would not
agree, in the other it would not convict. Is there
any record in any part of Australia of a Judge

Queensland has six Kanakas under sen-
tence of death for a cold-blooded murder of an
old hawker near Bundaberg. The sugar-planter
papers shriek for the blood of the savages, but, at
the same time, point out that they come from
Malayta, where murder is not regarded as a
serious crime, Queensland, in importing murder-
ous savages, should be prepared to take all re-
sponsibility. The Govt, is morally guilty of the
manslaughter—at all events—of the old pedlar,
for it permitted the importation of men known
to be cannibalistic savages of the fiercest type.
By the way, Bundaberg (Q.) Mail remarks, re
the proposed slaughter: “It is, under the
exigencies of the position, almost imperative that
the men be hanged in Bundaberg.” Bundaberg
always was ambitious.

The Chinese 'washerman has now almost
got into Bourke-st., Melb. To overcome the
prejudices of people who object to John doing up
their linen—John employs a Mr. (say) Brown-
Jobson to open a nice shop with “English

seen near the place. Every nationality is now
represented by laundries in Melb. —but the Irish.
Mrs. P. Murphy is still only a washerwoman.

The Rev. Rentoul (Melb.) is of opinion
that bicycle-riding “purifies a girl’s spirit.” A
case in point : There is a peaceful old crank in
Sydney whose occupation seems to consist in
removing refuse out of a stable, and his barrow
bears the inscription, “God is love.” The other
day he shambled out into the street with his
barrow and his inscription,
and the wheel was just in time
to upset a lady cyclist on her
back in the gutter, with her
feet and two clocked stockings
flying in the air. And when
she collected herself out of the
dust, and felt for her back hair,
and recovered her lost hat, she
helped the old person to right
his barrow, which had gone
over }n the collision, and then
rode off without using a single
strong expression. She went
away with a bright smile on
her countenance, and the old
man stood gaping with his
barrow of refuse and obviously
fell in love with her on the
spot.

Card. Moran favors the establishment of
a “ Eaugh-a-ballagh Regiment ”in N.S. W. The
scheme is, perhaps the reactionary result of fore-
going the usual St. Patrick’s Day whisky this

Sunday. Which shows the folly of neglecting to
take one’s “ medsin ” at the proper interval.
Australia doesn’t want to breed any Scotch, Irish

be “ Australian ” only.

Pneumatic boots!
An eager man rushed
Into Foy’s (Melb.), the
other day, to offer a new
patent, for £5OO 0.
“There’s millions in it,”
be cried. To walk on air
is no longer a poetic fie-
tion! Pump air into your
pumps and waltz over
creation!” Managers
heard the inventor—they
came to scoff and stayed
to contemplate. The
boots were there, in fact.
Theinventorused a pump
at the instep and the soles
became thicker, and the
heels, which had been
crushed like a concertina,
assumed a normal shape.
Managers put on the
boots and walked and
wondered. Pliancy,light-
ness, silence—all these
the inventor claimed uu-
contradicted. But a
severer test was needed.
How would they suit a
15-stone man. “Bring
him here and try,’’said
the inventor. They
brought John May, the
colos.'us of Foy’s. The
circular John blushed
when they called him a
15-stone man. “ I’m
17f-stone,” he said. A 1
the better. The inventor
pumped the boots tighter
and handed them over.
John walked therein and
said he liked them foine.
So it goes on. But,
when the pneumatic
fiends have used up all
the air on boots, bikes,
pea-rifles, and parlia-

Rockhampton stole
from Malta the allitera-

A meeting was held in Sydney the othir
d:iy with a view to establishing a “Clerks and
Warehousemen’s Benefit Association.” The Asso-
ciation is to consist of employes only, and its
benefit funds are to be subscribed by employes
only. Nevertheless, the obsequious clerks ami
warehousemen invited all the leading employers i f
Sydney to attend, and they occupied the platform,
while the clerks and warehousemen filled the body
of the hall. An employer was in the chair, and
the officers elected were all employers, except
Chief Justice Darley, who condescendingly ac-
cepted the position of patron, his letter to that
effect being read amid the enthusiastic applause of
the clerks and warehousemen. The billet of trea-
surer is not yet filled, but a bank manager is to
have it later on. There is a fine element of
grovel about the clerks and warehousemen. No
other men would refuse to trust themselves with
their own money, and ask their bosses to take
care of it, and do as they darned well
liked with it; or would refuse to manage their
own association; or would think of having a
“patron ” hitched on to a purely business under-
taking. The patron, by the way, has nothing to
do and doesn’t subscribe or assist in any way ;■ he
is wanted solely for prostrative purposes, and why
the Emperor of Germany wasn’t offered the billet
is inexplicable. Also, the clerks and warehouse-
men are the only people The Bulletin knows of
who, when they met to start a plain business un-
dertaking with their own money and for their own
benefit, would spend most of the time cheering
their employers and the Chief Justice. Walter
Besant once said that there was nothing else on
this earth quite so hopeless and abject as the
cheap clerk. Which statement only goes to show
that Besant hasn’t studied the warehouseman.

Judging by the report of a Board of Health
officer on the typhoid plague in the Sydney suburb
of Erskineville—a place chiefly jerry-built on
ground filled up with dust-cart rubbish and gar-
bage, the proper treatment would be to set fire to
the whole suburb, burn it to the ground, take up
the improperly-constructed sewers and relay them
properly, fine most of the burnt-out landlords
heavily, or, in default, confiscate their land, and
start afresh.

in Melb. streets in a Tam O’Shanter hat of green

the utmost advantage ; and a brown costume with
green velvet bodice to match the hat. Passing up
Oollins-street at the busiest time of the day, when
the pavement outside the Stock Exchange was
crowded with brokers just come off Change, she
found a way cleared for her through the tluong,
and busy brokers leaving off their bartering to
mutter beneath their breath, in tones of reverent
rapture, that yonder was the Gaiety girl who was
lorn at St. Kilda. Maud is inclined to stoutness

The erstwhile proprietor ot a Sydney ex-
press-messenger-despatch concern of over 30 years
ago tells a story which should serve as a special
warning to all women with a past, and to diary-
keepers in particular. In the east of the city
there resided a mysterious single lady with her
alleged nephew, a little boy, who used to mind the
house whenever “auntie” went out. She was
very reserved, had few visitors, and, never mixing
with her neighbors, was generally
unpopular with the female con-
tingent around. One afternoon
some express-messenger boys de-
livered a draper’s circular from
house to house in her street, much
to the admiration of the young-
ster, who resolved to emulate
their style and speed. When
the aunt came home that evening
nearly every woman was at her
gate and passed some
remarkably scathing
observation as she
went by. “ Your
little son has just
gone home,” volun-
teered one lady.
“Your own loving
pet,” tittered a bony
female from her
verandah. “ When
you last kissed me, dar-
ling, Iswore nothing should
part us,” shouted a giddy
miss as she ran in and slara-
-*J*med the door. “How’s
Georgie?” enquired another.
Reaching home at last with
rage and bewilderment in her
heart, she discovered a horrible
thing. The youngster had removed a
packet of old letters from the chest of
drawers and carefully deposited an
epistle under the door of every house-
holder in the street. He hadn’t missed
one. It was the- most conscientious
non-professional delivery on record.
Sam Lyons, Premier Turner’s senior
partner, the brisk attorney, told the Fitzroy
bench, the other day, that, as a member of the
School Board of Advice, he found the girls far
more addicted than the boys to writing indelicacies
on the walls.

In the above portrait The Bulletin tries
to give its readers some idea of the loveliness ot
the ruling Melb. beauty. Mechanical processes,
alas! play havoc with “the exquisite coloring,
the rose-leaf tint of the skin, the deep blue of the
eyes, and the changing brown and gold of the sott
hair,” which have made her for the past two
seasons belle of the Southern city. “ Yet (writes
the enthusiastic slave whose_ soul is translated
into the foregoing epithets) “if but a tithe of her
charms be reproduced, her sway will at once be
acknowledged.” The lady is married, has a sturdy
two-year-old son, and is the daughter of a well-

less? It recalls a mot: “Why do old maids

Cabled that Lord Sholto Douglas, son of
that queer person the Marquis of Queensberry,
has been arrested in California “on a charge
of insanity, in order to prevent his mar-
riage with a waitress.” The waitress s friends
doubtless preferred to run any risk rather than
that of contamination by the English nobility.
The Douglases are a cranky lot. One of the Mar-
quis’s sisters married a journeyman baker,
another sister, Lady Florence Dixie, immortalised
herself by her hysterical romance about 1 enians
in buckram ; and another son of the Marquis,
Lord Alfred, is the friend of Oscar Wilde.

Lord Howe Island (a dependency of N.S.

G F. : This paper doesn’t recommend any English gram-
mar The flrst to hand will do for reference ; none, to
the general student, is worth study for itself—none ade-
quate, complete, up-to-date. Grammars are the Pro
crustean beds of language; the Chinese flower-pots which
stunt a noble tree. The time spent over them in schools
is mainly wasted—just as if the scholars were to pore all
the year round over the Marylebone rules in Ihe hope of
learning how to play cricket. If you want to write
English, read English—get familiar with evety noble
stroke in the game, and knowledge of the rules will come
of itself. Study, if you like, the history and structure of
the language in books which bring brains to illuminat e
the mechanism (Meiklejohn’s “ English Language,
through Book Exchange, Is. 3d., is a jewel). But mere
collections of arbitrary rules are almost useless. There is
nothing arbitrary in language, which changes from day
to day. The momentary usage of the majority is the only
criterion of correctness. If there is one thing the gram-
mars are clear about, it is that plural isn’t singular, yet,
almost within the memory of grammars, the plural
“you” has come to refer to a single person, and now
young Australia pluralises it as “yous.” At present,
“yous” is wrong; but when, if ever, a majority of Aus-
tralians adopt it, and it wins a footing in classical litera-
ture, it will be right.

some to a labourer who was lamed by a stone
falling upon him. whom it cured. A woman had
a pain in the elbow and could not bend it for a
year, and it cured her, and another used it for
scurvy op her leg, and it was doing her good -one
letter doses from him with the words, “ It is the

Pert and pretty Grace Palotta, of the Gaiety girlhood,
who will be the public's favorite ere the season is done,
has a distinct leaning towards legitimate drama, ami to
that end she makes every effort to remove all elocutionary
trace of her slight and charming Austrian accent. H-r
graceful carriage, which has so captivated Melh. johnnie-
doni, is the outcome of education at a fjeipsic school,
where physical deportment was ranked as an essential in
girlish training.
Grace Palotta s heart-broken “Oh, Sharley 1 ” when
Ely ley repels htr advances implants a wild desire in every
individual in the audience to rise up and “deal out
stoush” to that beauteous youth.
Perhaps the most p dnful moment in the disgraceful
scene that took place on Melh. Bijou stage on the Dacres’
last night, was when poor Muriel Carr went off into wild
hysterics during the last act. Had it not been for Shine’s
promptness in rushing down the steps and catching her
in his arms, she would no doubt have had a bad f ill and
hurt herself severely. Amy Moselle sobbed audibly dur-
ing the whole of the “debate” that followed between
Phil. Stuart and Dacre.
Rehearsal at Melb. Princess’:—“Stop dancing and come

Pnrves, Q.C., in the Greener case, made a witness (an

a lot, to Che great amusement of a court that was “ stand-

these lejcal variety-shows? Pnrves also ifave an imitation
of a scene between defendant Abrahams and his work-
man Saws, iu true Yiddish dialect. But he can only act
in court; he was a ghastly failure when he tried Buzfuzat
a Royal matinee some y ars ago.
Dear Bullrtix, - The drivel of a small section of Melh.
theatre-goers who compare the present Gaietv Co. un-
favorably with the ’orrible Lonuen's, makes me tired.
Just compare them this way—Monkhonse, Lonnen; K.ave,
Courtneidge; Decima Moore, Marion Hood ; Grace’
Palotta, Alice Leamsr; Maud Hobson, Addie Conyers;
Madge R *s3ell, Alice Lethbridge, And, then, there are
Bl niche Massey, Rvlev, Bmdffeld and Bantock un-
accounted for.—Yours, Shadow.
H,: “I was in the midst of the amphitheatre on the
first night of the ‘Gaiety Girl,’ and must declare it only
achieved a success of esteem, In the -French sense, and
the popular audience broke up a trifle disappointed. The
fluinra ry has a pleasant aroma, hut Australia relishes
more backbone, besides a less hectic tone of morality. In
short, there is a workaday religion in onr audiences
entirely lacking in the atheistical fashionable mob, for
which such banalities are devised. Its enthusiasm is our
contempt. ’’
Raymond Blathwovt knew R. S. Smythe in London, and

One of the most up-to-date features in the Gaiety is the
uiub elia Mcnkhouse cirries in the first act. It has a
cr >ok handle like a johnnie stick, with which he hangs if
to his arm in the approved fashion. This elegant styfe of

is also worth a line; in fact, the dressing of the men in

and good style.

Many ladies who favor that most becoming

King of Ladies’ Tailors in Australasia—Mr. B.
King, late of Coil ins-street, and, we are sure, will
be pleased to discover him again. We are able to
give the information. We now find him with
Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson and Sons, the successors
of the old-established firm, Moubray, Rowan and
Hicks, who, under his guidance, have made a
special department for Ladies’Tailoring—a branch
which it is not surprising to see daily increases in
favor. It is to Mr. King that ladies have to be
grateful for a new patent riding-skirt, which

SPORTING NOTIONS.
That smart Melb. cricketer, Frank Walters,
takes up his residence in Sydney shortly to qualify for the
N.S. \V. eleven next season. He yearns for revenue on the
Vic. Association for what lie considers harsh and un-
merited treatment; and aspires to follow Percy M'Domnll's
example of leaving Victoria and scoring a few double-
century innings against it.

There is little enthusiasm displayed over the
opening of Melb. football season. The strictly amateur
champion footballer, who loafed about in piths, from one

the incense of harrackers’ admiration is no longer wafted
up his nostrils. Those snug lit tie billets of keeping tne
sparrows off the cricket-pilch, at £2 10s. per week, are no
more, and footballers now have to work for their living

Frank Slavin, who, but for a lucky b1v.77,

in a fair way of losing his head. “ Hia challenge to Peter
Jackson is childish,” remarks Tub Bulletin's London
correspondent, “for he and Ins friends must know that he
hasn’t a chance with Peter. Slavin was as fat as a prize
ox when he met the Coffee Cooler, and I doubt very
much if that nimble gentleman would not have him ‘on

got his chance, and availed himself of it."

Felix, if liia contest with Dooley results favor-

singularly unlucky in his fights with Jackson, Slavin, and
Goddard. Physically he is belter than ever, whereas the
three others have gone hack (Jackson being a doubtful

protested-that the race was not the stipulated distance.
Consideration of the protest was deferred ; the races were
finished, and the officials, except two or three stewards,
left the course. The remaining stewards then dealt with
the protest, and, though Darby was the only competing
pony still on the ground, decided that the race should be
run again. A temporary judge and starter were ap-
pointed, and, having covered the ground solus, Darby was
declared the winner. The owner of Freestone threatens

The two country speculators who bought the

the “ Oh, we ate memhahs ” dodge. Jockeys engaged in
the meeting were admitted free on presenting their certi-
ficates ; and over 200 such tickets w-ere handed in, repre-
senting about six times the number of actual riders. The
“ have ” wasn’t detected at the time, but the gaternen
bucked when a woman came up smiling with a Jock.’s

The FOURTH REPORT of the DIRECTORS
Of
The COLONIAL BANK of AUSTRALASIA
LIMITED,
To be Presented to the Shareholders at the Fourth
Ordinary General Meeting, to be Held at the
Bank, 126 Elizabeth-street, at noon on Tuesday,
30th April, 1895.
REPORT.
The directors beg to submit to the shareholders
their fourth report with a balance-sheet and state-
ment of profit and loss for the half-year ended the
31sl March, duly audited.
In consequence of the shrinkage in the volume
of business, the low rates ruling for money, ami
the high rate of interest payable on deferred
deposits, the directors regret jihat the transactions
fur tiie half-year, after payment of interest on
deposits and expenses, show that the balance at
credit of profit and loss brought forward from last
half-year, viz., <£4937 18s. lid., has been reduced
to <£243 25., which will be carried forward to next
half-year.
As it is obvious that the bank cannot continue
to pay the high rate of per cent, per annum on
its long-dated deposits, your directors will endea-
vour at an early date to obtain the consent of the
deferred deposit receipt holders to a reduction in
the rate of interest.
The market for securities is still in a stagnant
state, and although it is impossible to value them
accurately we feel that when the proposed amend-
ment of the Companies Act is passed it will be
necessary to.make further provision for losses by
writing off a portion of the capital. _
Four branches have, been closed during the half-
year, viz., North IMolbourne, Sauci-
ford, and Orbost.
Your directors have given special attention to
the expenditure, of the bank, ar.d it will be
that during the half-year a reduction of
6s. Iftd. has been made in the expenses, in addi-
tion to previous reductions. ,
The fourth ordinary general meeting of share-
holders will be held at the head office of the com-
pany, 126 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, on 1 ues-
day, the 30th day of April, 1895, at noon.
By order of the board.

The last words of jockey Jimmy Hayes ere
leaving for ’Frisco were, “Save me from my friends!”
He had, he said, resolved that he would never again in
his life allow himself to be influenced and controlled by
pals,” considering that the early and ignominious close
of his Australian career was caused by placing too much
confidence in people who were undeserving of it. On the
same occasion Hayes stated that Stevenson “ has the best
bands of any jockey now riding.” And Hayes is not a
bad judge of riding. , m ,

Mayor Lees “firmly but courteously
declined” to preside at the big Sydney Centen-
nial Hall meeting on the Dean case. Mr. Lees
thus tirmly but courteously declined to do his
duty as Mayor. His alleged reason seems to be
that be doesn’t like to aid in bringing pressure on
Bench or Executive. Then why did he go on the
recent deputation to urge Abigail’s release?
The trustees of N.S.W, Art Gallery have
consented to act as judges in an art competition
for prizes of 75, 25, and 15gs., offered by Mr. H.
S. Chipman for tiie three best pictures of
“ Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom,” the original
work of Australasian artists. The prizes are
sufficiently liberal to tempt considerable compe-
tition, and there should be a collection worth
seeing at Sydney Art Gallery on Ist Sept, next,
when the competition closes.
The recent fatal fire at Parkes (N.S.W.),
when two women and five children lo.t their lives,
is a solemn warning to the woman who suffers
from chronic burglar scare. The deceased
lived in constant dread of that anticipated
li .use-breaker who never comes except when
he is not expected, and, in order to keep
hmi out, they had all the windows nailed up and
the doors secured with a multitude of elaborate
f.jBtenihgfcr - When the fire broke out they conldn t
undo the fastenings or burst the casements, and
the n itural result ensued. A nail in a window-
b tsh is very-little good to keep a burglar out, but
for keeping-two terrified women and five children
in it h invaluable.
“Healthy Mothers and Sturdy Children :
the Australian Wife’s Book,” published by E. W.
Cole, Melbourne, is a bandy compendium of medi-
cal science and common sense, especially designed
for the u&e of families. The work has been com-
piled with great care, and should prove a boon to
every house-mother, but particularly to her whose
lot is cast in the Australian bush.
Toxa, the new rabbit destroyer, is making
great headway. It is incombustible, in which
respect it has a great advantage over all com-
pounds containing phosphorus; it is cheap,
efficacious, and as horses, cattle, and sheep refuse
to eat it, while the rabbit takes it freely, it sticks
closely to business. Half-a-crowu’s worth of
Toxa is reported, on apparently good authority,
to have killed 550 rabbits, and one large run in
Maoriland has been so effectually cleared that it
now carries 30,000 more sheep than formerly.

Nathan Herman, whose Misfit Parlor in
Wynyard-street is the beginning of a new Sydney
industry, finds that he has opened up a larger
industry than he was aware of. There are more
misfit boots, shirts, dresses and clothes generally
than he imagined in his wildest dreams, and the
immense quantity which he has bought up enables
him now to fit everybody at the lowest possible
rates, except the individual of whom there is only
one sample in all the world. And even he may be
fitted byaccident. Mr. Herman is going m for
the business of a universal provider, and though
lie isn’t quite universal he has got a consider-
able distance on the way. There are 20 separate
departments in the Wynyard-street warehouse,
including glass, crockery, bedding, bedsteads,
carpets, watches, niauioiicls, ulaukets,
boys’ clothing, men’s clothing, ladies’ clothing,
and many other kinds of clothing. Mr. Herman
also supplies excellent cigars (not misfits) at IM.
each, and the gaudy Masonic apron, which the
lodge furnishes with awe-inspiring ceremonial at
245., he supplies at 7s. 6d. Most of the awful
majesty is gone from the great Masonic bosh
when the apron can be bought for /s. od.
Mr. Herman sends all kinds of goods free, in
large or small quantities, to any part of N.o.
Wales, but he whoops most particularly about
his £2 parcel, which consists of two shirts, boiled
or colored as required, two undershirts six
pairs socks, two tics, two collars, six hand-
kerchiefs, one set studs, one hat, one pair
braces, a suit of clothes, and a pair of
boots. This parcel is the great effort of his life,
and anyone sending along the £2 will get it with
all possible despatch. Any person who is afraid
to send along the £2 without a reference, is re-
quested to inquire of the Hank of N.S.W. At
present the premises are being enlarged to make
room for an unlooked-for rush of business, and a
gilded minion at the front door is kept busy
pointing out the way to the department where
the waterproof coat is sold at Ids- bd.

We certify that we have examined the accounts of The National Bank of Australasia Limited for
the half-year ending 31st March, 1895, together with the statement of profit and loss, and the aggre-
gate balance-sheet for the same period (the assets and liabilities at the branches are taken on the
certificates of the managers and accountants), and that in our opinion the balance-sheet is a full and
fair balance sheet, containing the particulars required by the Articles of Association, and properly
drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the bank’s affairs.

The climax of the tissue of illegalities and
follies attending the court-martial on the case of
Captain Close, of N.S. W. Artillery, was reached
when the Executive undertook to review the find-
ings of the Court. They could no more refuse to
“confirm” the verdict of "guilty” on the 3rd
and 4th charges than they could reverse the ver-
dict of a jury. They could send the case back to
be reconsidered, or they could remit the punish-
ment ; but the verdict must .stand, rightly or
wrongly, as one of “guilty.” All the same, the
whole of the proceedings, from first to last, were
grossly irregular—the composition of the Court
included.
The strike at Hudson Bros.’, Sydney, has
ended in a o >mpromise which, from thecommunity’s
pomt of view, is only less injurious than the firm’s
original proposals. The employers, who pre-
viously paid avages 10 per cent, below ordinary
tradej’ates, wished to make a further reduction of
10, 15, and 20 per cent. The employes have
agreed to a further reduction of 7, 10, and per
cent. Therefore, if there is any force in the
logic and rhetoric which this paper has brought
to bear on the question, the wages of com-
petitive firms’ employees must sooner or later
suffer a similar reduction. The men, in fact,
have given away the whole principle which justi-
fied their strike—the only principle on which the
“ law of supply and demand ” can be effectively
attacked. Only, they have not given it away
quite so violently as they were asked to do.
Would The Bulletin, then, have had the men
continue on strike ? There is no incumbency to
answer the question. This paper pointed out the
right course ; but on the men themselves must rest
the onus of deciding its feasibility in the face of
starvation.

Dear Bulletin, — Rev. Haweis’s idea of
the hotel-church is realised at Wyalong, N.S.W.,
where the Baptists meet on Sundays in a local
pub—the holy and unholy spirit seeming to frater-
nise very amicably. Whereupon, I ask you : (1)
How does this fit in with the Licensing Act,
which prohibits hotel entertainments, especially
on Sundays? Is a religious corrobboree an “ en-
tertainmentwithin the meaning of the Act? (2)
What defence could publicans make to a charge of
selling watered whisky, with their houses filled
with the emanations of an aquatic creed ? (3)

Once a Bishop of Riverina was being
driven in a buggy by the station black-boy. On
the way they encountered a gate. The black-boy
drew up the horses; the bishop looked at the
black-boy, who took the hint, handed the reins to
the man of prayer, jumped down, and opened the
gate. Later another gate obstructed. The bishop
looked at the black-boy ; the black-boy looked at
the bishop. The bishop said: “My boy, please
get down and open the gate.” The black-boy
obeyed. Soon they reached a third gate, and as
the black-boy was reining in the horses he said :
“ Baal open this feller blanky gate, Bishop; your
turn now !” The bishop complied.

I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as 1
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have

Lord Kintore is said to be an applicant for
theN.S.W. Governorship.
A Mussulman deputation has been refused
by Govt, a grant of land for a mosque in Perth
—very unfairly? seeing that all the Christian sects
have been well bonused. The Govt, apologists
say there are precedents both ways. Mammon is
the god most worshipped, and he doesn’t get land
free for his temples—banks.
In the Greener-Abrahams (civil) case the
other day, at’Melbourne, Emanuel Abrahams, in
cross-examination, told Mr. Purves, Q.C., that he
did not consider him honest, as he had accepted a
retainer and eight guineas from 'them, and was
now appearing against them. Whereupon the
genial Purves_ explained that the retainer was only
a general retainer to defend them at the Criminal
Court, and -‘at the Criminal Court he would give
them the value of their money as far as he possibly
could.”

THIS Company is formed to acquire Fifteen auriferous sections, immediately adjacent to tlie cele-
brated Harris’ Reward Gold Mine, at Mount Jukes, West Tasmania, and to work or re-sell all
or any of the same. The sections are known or numbered as follows on the accompanying plan of the
district: —Nos. 7 (otherwise Sailor Jack), 9, 12, 14, 34, 36, 39, 44, and A, B, C, D, E, F and G. The
sections comprise an area of about 140 acres.
As will be seen from the plan, what is believed to be Harris’ Reward rich reef, has been found on
section No. 9. An auriferous reef has also been located on section B, whilst a third reef is proved on
section No. 7 (Sailor Jack).
The developments now taking place on Harris’ Reward Claim prove the existence of an enormous
body of highly ptyable quartz, the reef being from 8 to 12 feet wide, and in the opinion of the Manager
(Mr. Nugent) good for 6to 7oz. per ton. In his report of 16th April on the Harris claim, Mr. Nugent
states :*' I have extended Harris’ trench 6 feet further South. There is a splendid show in it. The
reef is 12 feet wide, and every stone a good specimen. I sunk a shaft 28 feet deep on the Western
wall, at the extreme Northern end. There is a grand reef in sight, very rich, and a 6-iuoh leader
extremely rich.
It is odieved that every one of the sections proposed to be acquired by the Company will prove
aunfi io is.
S • i nportaut are the developments on the Harris Reward Mine (which was only discovered and
taken up last N w Year’s Day) considered by the Government of Tasmania that despite the depleted
condition of the Treasury, the Government are constructing a road thereto at a cost of <£460—,£300 to
be paid by the Government of Tasmania, £5O by the Harris’ Reward Gold Mine, and £lOO by this
proprietary.
The intention of the proprietary is, as developments proceed on the Harris’ Reward, and on the
sections belonging to the proprietary, to re-sell to subsidiary Companies on favorable terms a portion
or al of the propriet ir y sections. It will easily be understood that a considerable profit may be
derived from the re-sale of these sections.
There is no doubt that the rich alluvial gold, worked in the immediate neighbourhood of Mount
Juk es, was derived from the line of reef traversing these sections.
As an evidence of their belief in the mine, the Vendors are content to take a large portion of the
purchase consideration in contributing and other shares.
If no allotment, the purchase money will be returned in full; in the case of allotted shares, if the
allotment-money is not paid within eight days of the allotment, the allotment may be cancelled, and
the application deposit forfeited to the Company.
Reports, specimens, and plans are on view at the Company’s offices, and a careful inspection ot
these is confidently invited. A copy of a report, also, by A. T. Kenney, the well-known mining
expert, is appended. r
Report by A. T. Kenney, on Mount Jukes Proprietary Sections.
W. H. DICKSON, Esq.,
South Yarra, April 16th, 1895.
SIR.—In compliance with the request embodied in yours to hand of the 9th inst., lam pleased to
state that during a four weeks’visit of inspection to Harris’ Reward claim and other leases on Mt
Jukes, West Tasmania, I examined Blocks Nos. 7,9, 12, 14, 34, 36, 39, 44, and Blocks marked ABC
D, E, F, G, on accompanying plan, which are now under offer for flotation, and report thereon as
follows :
1. Blocks Nos. 36, A, 9 and 12 are North to North West of, and adjoining, Harris’ Reward Claim
and directly on the line of Harris’ rich reef, which has been traced and proved on Block No 9 carry-
ing gold. * ’ J
2. Block B.—ln addition to the probability of getting the underlay of Harris’ rich reef in depth
a Separate auriferous reef has been found on the South East corner of this lease.
3. Blocks Nos. 14, 34 and 44 lie West to South West of Harris’ Reward claim. As the reef in
Harris’ Reward claim underlays West, these blocks have good prospects of cutting same, and are con-
sequently very valuable.
4. Blocks 39, D, F and G are on the direct line of Harris’ Reward rich reef, and the surface stone
showing gold freely can be traced on the surface at intervals through them.
5. Block 7, known as Sailor Jack.—An underlay shaft has been sunk 40 feet, the stone being well
mineralised, assays taken from this reef giving good prospects of gold and silver. This is a parallel
lode to and quite distinct from Harris’ Reward reef. 1
6. 0 and E (West of 39, D and F) promise well for the West underlay of Harris’ Reward
rich reef.
In conclusion, considering the wonderful character of the developments so far on the Reward
claim, I consider your proprietary have secured in these sections a most valuable property posses-ing
promise of highly remunerative returns to parties investing in them. ’ ' 9

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
" It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of <>he
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Conger s Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never ho able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Conger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of
Its value no other woidd be
used."
N.T.’s Empty Bottles.
The Northern Territory (S. A.) Times prints the follow-
ing verses, read by an unnamed member of the Palmerston
Literary and Debating Society at a recent meeting. Who-
ever he may be, that man has a fine eye for a point and a
moral; and The Bulletin wants to hear from him again.
Bottles everywhere just teeming, lying all about
and seeming
To be ever, ever dreaming of the days that are no
more;
And I camped each night a rover, as I trod the
country over,
Hardly finding room to lay me for them as I
sought the shore,
Each day finding as I sought Australia’s farthest
northern shore,
Empty bottles on before.
On the burning plains they’re scattered, and
where miners rocks have shattered,
And on stations, and ’way inland by the deep
artesian bore,
Whence we all too often borrow ghastly tales of
grief and sorrow;
Grief of those who know no morrow, ending life
in blood and gore.
But what made their lives so precious shudder out
in blood and gore ?
Empty bottles, nothing more.
’Neath the darksome jungle’s shutter, where the
wood-doves flirt and flutter,
Where Dame Nature pours profusely bounties
from her goodly store —
There I saw them vigils keeping, shining backs
for ever peeping
From the grass where I beheld them, veritable
ghosts of yore.
And a voice beside me whispered : “From the
festive days of yore
Empty bottles, n ithing more.”
So the cue thus found I followed, as I trod o’er
ground all hollowed
To enrich Chinese who wallowed, where white
men had heretofore
Worked the mines with proper methods, but had
sunk before the slipshods.
What could be the cause? I shouted, “Tell me,
tell me I implore !’’
And the voice beside me echoed, “Tell me, tell
me I implore !
Bottles ! bottles ! Nothing more.’’
Days had come in olden Southport, when the
bottles gave great mouth-sport,
And their drinkers daily stretched out, stretched
them out upon the floor.
Those were days of constant chances —which now
come like firefly glances.
At what work then did they labor, daily labor by
the score,
Those fine miners, at what labor did they labor
by the score ?
Emptying bottles, nothing more.
Then those scenes of sad disaster followed ever
faster, faster—
Idle men, dishonest master, neglected mines of
priceless store —
Blots these on our history’s pages, which will shock
the modern sages,
And the men in coming ages who may read our
records o’er,
When they find just what has happened as they
read our records o’er —
Through the bottles, nothing more.
So N.T. began to languish. Then there came
that flood of anguish—
Chinese from the ports of China surging up upon
our shore :
And with methods old and tardy, they—thesteady,
sober, hardy—
Won the white man’s gold and country, ever,
ever, more and more ;
And our thanks for this is owing, for this ever more
and more—
To the bottles, nothing more.
Should it ever be so fated that white men, by
“ John ” disrated,
Should become all isolated from N.T.’s exten-
sive shore,
And to wipe us from existence “John” main-
tains with great persistence,
This had always been a China —as he read in
books of yore—
What will show we had a being, and disprove
those books of yore ?
Empty bottles ! Nothing more.
The cruel Cootamundra murder appears
likely to be added to the long list of N.S.W. un-
avenged crimes.

The North Australian Pastoral Co., of
Townsville, gives notice that it will prosecute
anybody shooting or otherwise trespassing on
its Woodstock station. The company consists
chiefly of absentees, and its country covers over
1000 sq. miles — i.e., including Inkerman station
and purchased land—and extends from ten miles
north of the Charters Towers railway to within
eight miles of the Bowen line (say over 70 miles
in length, with the exception of a strip of land
under ten miles intervening), with a width in
some places of 30 miles from the coast. The
notice was only advertised once and on the eve of
the open season for shooting.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TZEIIR-IBIEI CASTLES 77 and “ C-A^ST-A-TsT. 77
We have declined to confoVm with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “ Capstan.” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Sydney Pickpockets,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Altogether, there are in Sydney between 40 and
50 professional pickpockets, ranging from 20 to 60
years of age, and recognising in their ranks some
five or six women. Out of the total some two or
three are English; two or three American; the
rest are Australians, mostly Sydney natives. In
the vernacular of the fraternity there are three
chief classes: the “breech-hooks,” numbering
about 20; the “moll-buzzers,” numbering about
12; and the “ bag-dippers,” who vary from 6 to 10.
# • •
The “breech-hook”is the fine and daring gentle-
man of the craft; he flies at big game ;he picks
the pockets of men only, and looks down with
scorn on the lower orders, the “ raoll-buzzers
and “ bag - dippers,” who steal from women.
Doubtless if a richly-dressed woman, who could
easily afford the loss of .£2O, were to tempt the
“ breech-hook ” with her well-lined purse, his
inclination would overcome his sense of honor;
but, in the act of taking it, he would feel a loss of
dignity like that of which a Supreme Court bar-
rister is conscious in pleading a case at a police-
court.
• # *
The “ breech-hook ” reads and writes well, and
has a fair general education. He is well up in
gossiping topics and sporting incidents, and can
make interesting conversation for hours together.
His address is bright and ready ; in his clean
linen and well-tailored suit he looks exactly like a
comfortable bank-clerk.
# • •
He has formed his own code of morals, and his
simple domestic establishment is generally shared
w ith a fashionable member of the demi-monde, whom
he takes to the races and theatres, and«pn whom
he showers the successes of his profession. He
would scorn to take money or even food for
nothing from his mistress ; he never speaks to the
“ moll-buzzer ” or “ bag-dipper,” the low members
of the craft, who disgrace their calling by living at
times upon prostitution.
* * *
Now and again his amour is consecrated with
religious ceremony, and he unites himself J' 1S
mistress by the bonds of holy matrimony. She
gives up the sordid traffic of the person from
which his love has raised her; she studies his pro-
fession; and there are little heartburnings and
troubles when luck is low and his darling wants to
go out “on her own ” to pickpocket, too. _ It is
wife or paramour who sometimes in a jealous
passion betrays him to the wily detective and the
dubious vengeance of the law.
» • #
FromSo’clock in the morning till late atnightthe
“breech-hook” is inthecityplyinghis industry. He
has all his meals at restaurants, and can often be
seen lounging atone or other of them or in one of the
hundred and one popular billiard-rooms. He is as
well-conducted and sober as an evangelist with
money at heart; he is temperate in eating, drink-
ing and smoking. One, when asked about the
much-vexed drink, replied : “ I’m never the worse
for drink, sir, except when I’m down in the world;
I think drunkenness a crime.” It is obvious
enough that the nerve cannot be too steady, nor
the hand too light, that would abstract, unper-
ceived, a roll of bank-notes from the trousers-
pooket of a quick, active business man.
• • •
When misfortunes come in battalions, when the
heart is stricken with the pangs of despised love
or of betrayed friendship, then the “ breech-hook”
seeks solace in the cup.
# # *
He does all the Australian cities in turn, and
with his quick eyes and ears and lively tongue he
gains a wonderful amount of information concern-
ing business-men generally. He will follow' for a
whole day a man whom he suspects of having
money ; he watches the banks week in week out,
selecting his prey and reconnoitring for a haul.
# # •
At work, three sentries travel with oneadept. The
Master hovers near theselected quarry; thedisciples
watch for the detectives, all of whom they know
thoroughly by sight. When the game forces his
way through a knot in the crowd, or devotes his
attention to one of the conspirators having a fit
in the gutter, or when one of the score of oppor-
tunities born of a congested traffic presents itself,
the staffers simultaneously seize the moment, the
wink is given, the adept “ puts his hand down,
and a civilian and his money are abruptly sepa-
rated.
« • •
It is a deft artist who “ puts his hand down,’’
and on account of his wonderful skill and the
sharp vigilance of his mates the detectives have
great difficulty in making captures. The “breech-
hook ” is a stoical thief, and when caught red-
handed he will turn to the detective and remark
with a sturdy resignation, “You’ve got me dead
to rights this time.” And he does his six months
or three years in gaol without halt or whimper.
# * *
The Sydney “ breech-hook ” is a remarkable
craftsman. In his particular line he is the
prince of Australian pickpockets, and, perhaps,
has no rival in the world. Certainly he is far
cleverer than the two or three swell Yankees and
the two or three flash Englishmen who have
wedged themselves into a place in his ranks.
• • •
“Moll-buzzing” is the trade of that cowardly
branch of the profession ilvhieh lives by picking
the pockets of women. Ask a true “ breech-hook”
whether he is “ breech-hooking ” or “moll-
buzzing,” and he will reply with a fine scorn ;
“ Moll-buzzing 1 I’d sooner go ‘ breech-hooking
on my own.” That is, ho would prefer, un-
attended by scouts, to face the greater risk and
difficulty of robbing men.
# # *
The “moll-buzzer” hangs, with a mate or two,
about railway-stations, tram waiting-rooms, large
drapers’ and milliners’ shops, and at every spot
. where women wait for ’buses and trains. Woe
to the woman who gets lost in contemplation of a
handsome bonnet-window, or who allows two men
to jostle her while they assist her and her children
and parcels into ’bus or tram or train. The polite
volunteers are always ready to pay themselves
with her purse.
# # *
The “bag-dippers” are another section who
prey upon women. They travel by threes in
single file, and overtake women carrying bags or
baskets, and going in the same direction. Ihe
first man, in passing, merely opens the bag ; the
second puts his hand in; the third watches and is
ready to give the alarm if necessary.
* * *
Watch-picking, the great art of the English
pickpocket, is seldom practised in Australia. A
few clever watch-pickers came from London to
Australia a few years ago, but could not make a
success of their game. In other lines of the busi-
ness they were behind the local man, and only
managed to live by hobnobbing with him. Cutting
out pockets with scissors is another English trick
little patronised in Australia.
• • «
L ,an English master, came to Australia
four or five years ago, and introduced “ringing
the bags,” which is a favorite dodgeof the Eng-
lish and American thief. Though simple, it has
produced grand results. A clerk who goes regu-
larly, bag in hand, to a bank is marked for plunder.
One day as he is at the bank-counter and is plac-
ing his money in his bag, a well-dressed man says,
with affable alarm, “Sir, excuse me, you have
dropped a <£s-note !” The clerk looks down, sees
the note upon the floor, marvels at his own care-
lessness and the honesty of his benefactor, picks
the note up and puts it into his bag. But the bag
is not his ; it is only an exact duplicate, which the
thieves have left in place of his and the bulk of his
money. L ’s gang worked this trick for
,£3OOO in Adelaide, and made good hauls in Mel-
bourne and Sydney. But two years ago in Sydney
L ’s mate, Belfast, was nabbed with bag
and all at the counter of the Bank of N.S.W.
L bolted to Maoriland, and subse-
quently the rest of his gang, Henry, Miller, and
Long Tom, went with him to America. There
they had marked success until all four were caught
in the act of bank-robbing at Minneapolis and re-
ceived 10 years’ imprisonment. Since “Belfast’s”
capture, no case of “ringing the bags” has
occurred in Australia.
• • *
The English and American trick of “call-out”
was practised twice two years ago on Sydney
jewellers. A flash trap drove up to the door when
only one man was in the shop, and the thieves
called him out to attend to them. They showed
him a handsome watch which was out of order,
and when he went back to his shop they decamped
with the plunder which their mate, had secured
while the shopman’s back was turned.
• • •
There is a Sydney class of petty thief who is
original in his dexterity. He is generally a
juvenile, and, under pretence of selling news-
papers, he thrusts a folded one close to a civilian’s
face and picks the tie-pin he is wearing. These
“prop” thieves, as they call themselves, num-
bered 15 or 16 a few years ago; but several have
been convicted and several frightened, and only
four or five are daring enough to continue practice.
Sydney hasonly half-a-dozen female pickpockets,
and only one of them can be termed a orafts-
woman. She has lived by her fingers for 20
years, and is now, at 50 years of age, one of
the quickest pickpockets known. The rest of the
women thieves belong to the type of which
the notorious S is the best representative.
She is a prostitute of such abnormal vitality that
she has never suffered from the after-effects of a
wound inflicted on her by a jealous lover, which
“would have killed any other woman in the world.”
Her game is to talk and fool with the maudlin
youth in the city streets at night, and lavish en-
dearing caresses upon him which cost him his
money and valuables. Big drapery-establish-
ments are frequented by the female thief, as many
a woman knows who has put her purse aside and
forgotten it for a moment; shop-walkers and chiefs
of these establishments are ever on the alert for
well-known female thieves, who will snatch up
and secrete anything portable. When one such
female thief was caught, and her dress examined,
there were found, attached to hooks on her under-
clothing, no less than seven pairs of boots.
Pocket-picking and shop-thieving in Sydney are
decidedly on the increase. The hardy burglar is
turning to it, for it is almost as lucrative as his
own treacherous calling, while the sentences
awarded for the respective offences are altogether
disproportionate. There is very little satisfaction
in a 10-years’ term for burglary, but there is only
a short break to a busy life in a 6-months’ sentence
for “ breech-hooking.”
Again the absurd anomaly of the Melb.
Good Friday, with the pious ideal realised—pubs,
open, and theatres shut.
Apropos the Chinese oath, the favorite
story of a "Vic. County Court Judge may be rung
in.” They were altogether puzzled how to get at
the religion of a Chinaman, and even a rooster’s
head was cut off in vain. Then the interpreter
held up a lighted match. The witness pulled a
little black pipe out of his pocket, and lighted it
with “ Welly good ! ”
Some items from the English papers for
Feb. last: —
A gamekeeper, watching in a plantation for poachers,
was frozen to death ; an old woman in a flreless room was
found killed by the cold beneath her scanty blankets; a
lad was found with his tongue frozen to an iron railing—
he had ventured to touch it with his tongue and was
instantly frozen. An omnibus-driver was observed to be
on his seat in a half-recumbent position. He was dead
with the reins frozen in his hands. Many deaths were
reported from gangrene of the bowels, caused by the
extreme cold. Five London omnibus-drivers, one con-
ductor, and two cabmen died from the cold. A carter
died on his van at Fulham. A London policeman fell dead
while on his beat. More than one country postman
perished miserably by the roadside. The chairman of
the Wandsworth and Olapham Guardians suddenly ex-
pired on going into the open air. A man died while
waiting tor an omnibus. An army pensioner, who was at
the siege of Sebastopol, died in the street. A man, over-
come by the cold at Tottenham, fell, and when discovered
he was dead, his face beintf frozen to the bottom of a sink.

Marian’s Child .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
First we thought of the river,
But the body might be found;
And it did not seem so cruel
To bury it in the ground.
So small it seemed, so helpless—
I hardened my heart like stone—
She kissed it over and over,
And then I heard her groan.
I took it out of her bosom
It cried, and cried, and cried j
I carried it down the garden—
The moon was bright outside.
I dug a hole with a shovel
And laid the baby down ;
I shovelled the sand upon it—
The sand was soft and brown.
But, ah ! its cry was bitter—
I scarce could cover it in.
And when at last ’twas bidden
I sank beneath my sin.
Down at the foot of the garden,
Where the moon-made shadows fell,
I sold myself to the Devil
And bought a home in hell.
Down at the foot of the garden,
Where the weeds grew rank and wild,
Under the shivering willows
I murdered Marian’s child j
My heart was wildly beating,
My eyes and cheeks were wel^
For I heard the baby crying—
-0 God I I hear it yet.
I hear it crying, crying,
Just as I heard it cry
In Marian’s arms in the morning
When I knew that it must die.
Neither of us was woman—
-1 was the younger one;
And we strove to tell each other
What a wise thing we had done.
Why should it live to plague us?
Why should it ever begin
Travelling roads of trouble,
Soiling its soul with sin ?
Marian ! ah, she remembers I
In spite of all her tears
Sweet children call her mother
These many, many years.
Yet when I saw my darling,
Her blue eyes seemed to swell :
“ Annie !” she said, “ do you hear it ?
Listen ! I hear it well 1
“ In the night I hear it calling
With a muffled, plaintive wail,
And my heart stands still to count its sobs,
And always I try and fail;
For I think the depth of my baby’s grief
Will never fathomed be
Till the fires are lit in the bottomless pit
To blast eternity.”
«
Once in a southern city
Joy came into my life—
He loved me, kissed me, thought me
Worthy to be his wife . . ,
No, I will never marry.
God ! I had rather die—
If ever I had a baby
’Twould curse me with its cry !
For down at the foot of the garden,
Where the moon-made shadows fell,
I sold myself to ‘the Devil
And bought a home in hell.
S.A.
J. S. NEILSON.
The famous “ Tantanoola tiger,” which
appears intermittently in S.A. and Victoria, was
list seen by a fox-hunter, who was badly seared
by “ a large spotted animal with head erect and
cavernous mouth studded with great spiked teeth.”
1 he sight of the beast, however, had a more curious
effect on the dogs, according to the Hamilton
(Vic.) Spectator :
The dogs outpaced the horse at first, but presently they
turned tail and came towards him, giving out frightened
whelps and cowering in their gait with fear.
The tiger which fills the blank left by innumer-
able bunyips and the Dora-Dora blacks, is alleged
to be identical with a cub which escaped from a
travelling menagerie at Mt. Gambier (S.A.) thir-
t en years ago.
A N.S. W. country newspaper man empties
the bottle, runs his fingers through his hair, gazes
fiercely at the loose shingle in the roof, adjusts his
own loose shingle, jabs the pen in with deter-
mination, and splutters :
On Monday two children were drowned. Their gossip-
ing parents went to visit a neighbor, leaving the babies
with a full water-butt open in the house. The pair of
them should be flogged to the sea, and there thrown in
to be devoured by the sharks always on the alert for
carrion. The fact is that thousands of women are
allowed to become wives who are totally unfitted
for the position. Just as some girls will marry
anything in masculine attire, so are there foolish
mm who will lead to the altar any doll who has
a winning way, never giving a thought as to whether the
little humbug can cook a chop or make a pudding.
Mothers are mostly to blame. The woman who allows
her daughter to grow up without teaching her to pro-
perly cook a steak, make a pudding, and iron a shirt is
worse than a criminal. Nearly every man who has gone
to destruction has been sent there by his wife. The
worker goes out for a couple of hours before breakfast to
return at 8 o’clock and have put before him a junk of
meat that has been placed in a pan half-full of dripping.
The wife gets hold of a yellow-back novel and times about
six minutes for one side of the meat to cook, hut if the
chapter be a long one, or particularly interesting,
the time is extended. A sensible woman would
not use a pan at all, or if she did the drip-
ping would not be required. Prying-pans are one of
the abominations of our civilisation. The wife who really
respects her husband would take the steak and beat it for
her life for five minutes with the rolling-pin, to ensure
tenderness, then she would carefully cook it, have a tiot
dish, and put a piece of butter upon the cooked meat
The breakfast would then be easily digested, and the man
built up for the day. In the majority of cases woman is
man’s murderer. We have seen a woman howling over a
departed husband, and at the same time we knew she had
really killed the poor creature by her bad cooking.
The Archimedean liver again !
A Sydney firm of lithographers re-
cently got a post-card from a Vic. country editor,
asking quotation for a picture of “a human
stomach laid open and in the intestines seen a
number of worms writhing and crawling about,
also brain ditto.” It was probably wanted to
illustrate an article on the accursed drink.
Judge Windeyer said, when sentencing
George Dean to death on what the public regards
as insufficient circumstantial evidence, that he
was as certain that the prisoner had administered
poison to his wife as if he had seen the deed with
his own eyes. But, then, as the offensive Crick
remarked in N.S.W. Assembly, you can’t always
believe your eyes—at a Mellon stance, for in-
stance. Cook-sureness is a sore affliction, especially
in a Judge. Look at the Biittner case. Biittner,
a lodginghouse-keeper, a year or two ago in
Sydney, was cast for death on a charge of rape—
allegedly committed on a virtuous girl who had
sought the shelter of his house. The presiding
Judge (Foster) concurred in the verdict, but on
the very day Biittner was to have been hanged he
walked, a free man, into the office of lawyer Crick,
his defender, to thank him for his efforts—prose-
cutrix haying confessed (after the Brisbane police
had identified her as a street-walker, despite the
apparently-conclusive medical evidence adduced
at the trial) thatshe had been a consenting party.
And, after inflicting upon Biittner this great
wrong—after having condemned him and shaved
him and ironed him in the condemned cell, the
State actually refused to give him more than £5O
compensation, and this only on condition that he
left the country 1
The new regulations of the Union s.s. co.
of Maoriland provide—
That first and second officers are to be provided with
charts at the company ’s expense, that the captains’ charts
are to be open to their inspection, and that they are to
right, if they think that the vessel is not keeping 1
to her proper course, to point out the presumed error. If
the captain disregards their representations, they are, it
is stated, to put in a protest in writing, and to report the
matter at the next port of call. The circular also con-
tains regulations as to the sale of drink to officers on
board the steamers. It is provided that, other things
being equal, those officers who are total abstainers will
be preferred in reference to promotion.
And just here a new difficulty turns up. The
Wairarapa smash happened because the captain
refused to listen to the officers’ protests. There-
fore. for a time, there will be a tendency to sit
down hard upon any captain who doesn’t attend
to such protests, and the captain will probably
give vyay on this account. Then by-and-bye some
captain, who is taking the right course on a murky
night, will give way once too often, and the result
will be unutterable ruin, and after that it will be
necessary to fix up some new regulation. Acci-
dents will happen, so long as man is what he is,
eyen if the right of protest is given to everybody,
right down to the stowaway and the cook’s cat.
Dear Bulletin Scotty the Wrinkler”
and other authorities assert that the Australian
doesn’t light. He does, sometimes, and I respect-
fully tender my swollen eye and the broken nose
of a friend as evidence to that effect. The other
Saturday I was at a picnic at a seaside town
about 15 miles from Melbourne. It was not a
larrikin affair, by any means, but an ordinary
picnic of bank-clerks, dudes, nice girls who “do
the block’’in the afternoon, and the like. In the
evening, when the final dance was over, I and
another man were changing our shoes in the
dressing-room when a local youth intruded himself,
and fell over my friend’s feet. Then he bade us
“get out of the way,” and hit out without
further ceremony. My friend, who has no science
whatever, lashed out wildly in response, and left
the youth in a stunned condition on the floor.
Then three more local youths ran in, and the five
of us swiped blindly at each other for a time,
till, hearing the whistle blow, we broke through
them and ran for the train. When we were in the
train, my companion looked over the partition into
the next compartment, and a youth who was there
with two girls took offence thereat, and used
language. Then the pair proceeded to plug each
other across the partition in a wild, whirling
fashion, till the next station was reached. There
were five minutes to spare, so they got out and
battered promiscuously at each other till starting
time, and, just at the last moment, my mate, who
was sawing the air as if his arms were two flails,
happened to land in on the top of his antagonist’s
head and laid him out. The defeated warrior was
left behind in the confusion. After that all
was peace until the changing station was reached,
and there we found two of our picnickers banging
each other unscientifically on the platform, and a
small Hebrew youth called Abrahams cheering
them on. My mate remonstrated in a fatherly
manner and Abrahams rushed him on the spot.
Also Abrahams’ brother Isaac charged at me, and
there was a great conflict of six. It was a beau-
tiful free fight, and the air was full of hats, and
gore, and language, and hair, and fighting dude,
and debris. But, just at the most interesting
point, a louder riot rose outside the station, and
we suspended our disagreement and ran to the
scene. It was the rest of our picnic whic i was
being overpowered by another picnic, so we
r ushed to the rescue. The rest of the proceedings
were too confused for description. All I remember
is that my eye was damaged, and Jones’s nose
became a ruin, and that Abrahams and Isaac
fought desperately, and every dude went
straight into the fray and gave no quarter. No-
body was much hurt, as it happened, but it was a
joyous combat while it lasted, and when it was
over, and the two picnics had been dragged
asunder by the railway-officials, everybody felt
better for the exercise. Yes, the Australian does
fight, sometimes, especially when he is full of tea
and buns and ozone.—Yours, &c., M’G.
A GAIETY GLEE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Welcome, girls, though the gold-top gang
Of a bygone year far and wide are scattered !
Gaiety girls once danced and sang
that gang who grinn’d as if hugely flattered
Midnight suppers and gifts galore
Made Melbourne mad for a bygone bevy,
Now it’s a case of “ Ah, never more ! ”
For the chap in chokey the time hangs heavy.
Welcome, girls! In the old wild days,
The days of dear Nellie, Sylvia, Letty,
The gold-top gang flung fair bouquets
And shed much weep when they left the jetty ;
But those were the days when we didn’t long
With the longing of Need for a tinselled tonio—-
Now there’s a craving for Dance and Song
To lighten a load that is getting chronic.
