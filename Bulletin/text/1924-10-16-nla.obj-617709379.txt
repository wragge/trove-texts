The Red Page
Henry James
The problem of Henry James will always
be an interesting one to those who write.
Here was a man with remarkable literary gifts
—powers of observation, insight and expres-
sion—who devoted his whole life to his art
and yet failed to achieve anything of last-
ing value. That is a large statement, and it
is perhaps too soon to pass judgment. Time
reverses some contemporary judgments with
drastic completeness. But Henry James was
not the sort of obscure writer a later age
discovers after his own age has buried him
under the snows of neglect. All his life
was spent in the narrow but intense light of
literary circles, and in Paris and other capi-
tals he had important friends, like Tour-
genieff and Flaubert, who could have given
him a European reputation if they had been
intrigued by his art. As a means of arriv-
ing at a novelist’s final rank, the judgment
of foreign countries is a fairly good substi-
tute for that of posterity.
In a sense there is nothing mystifying
about the problem of James. His voluminous
letters throw the clearest light on what he
was trying to do. To his friends he wrote
copiously, with the energy and exactness of
a man who is determined, in all circum-
stances, to get the most delicate shade of his
meaning expressed. His subject-matter in
his letters is nearly always his work, or that
of other men, and it can be seen what a
formidable intellect he brought to bear on
the business of composition. Almost alone
among men writing in English, he had
worked out logical theories about the tech-
nique of novel-writing, and the structure
of each novel was planned with elaborate
care. Why are they, on the whole, so thin
and sapless, then? Why do their beautifully-
written pages seem to distil a scent of moth-
balls rather than of mountain thyme?
It is the fashion among dilettantes to say
that technique in novel-writing is of no
importance, and that the one thing neces-
sary is a fine, careless rapture. The big,
splashing, blundering genius, they argue,
never bothers about form, arid yet gains his
effects! That sort of talk is hardly worth
considering. Henry James would not have
done better if he had been a literary sloven
like Trollope. “There is nothing so deplor-
able,” he says in one letter, “as a work of
art with a ‘leak’ in its interest, and there
is no such leak of interest as through com-
monness of form. Its opposite, the found
(because sought-for) form, is the absolute
citadel and tabernacle of interest.” And this
is undoubtedly true. But why has the man
who sought form with a more distinguished
ardor and zest than any other novelist left
such an unsatisfying record in positive cre-
ation?
The answer must lie in some leak at
the very source of his creative power. The
early years of an artist are the crucial ones,
and Henry James was not happily placed in
youth. He was brought up in a cultivated,
self-conscious household in the middle-class
quarter of New York, where the sounds of
life were muffled and dulled, and the chief
contacts were with servants, or amiable ama-
teurs of philosophy or the arts. It was an
atmosphere to develop taste rather than
creative power. When all is said, the imagi-
nation is nourished by certain vital growths
of the soil and of human character, and no
synthetic food will serve as well. Desultory
trips to various resorts on the Continent,
where his father went in search of health,
helped to loosen whatever roots the boy had,
and as a young man he was left with' a
strong desire to write, and very little material
to work upon. Little, at any rate, that he
could easily use. “The face of nature and
civilisation in this our country,” he wrote
to Howells, “is, to a certain point, a very
sufficient literary field. But it will yield up
its secrets only to a really grasping imagina-
tion.” He knew he had not a grasping
imagination himself —merely one that had
to have its food brought to it properly cooked.
We get a picture of him standing waiting for
a horse-tram, on the edge of a torn-up pave-
ment in Boston, wondering what there was
in this crude, disorderly life that he could
turn into literature. He could only see life
adequately, he admits, in terms of other
men’s books.
In spite of his admission that America was
a sufficient literary field, he was infatuated
with the superior resources of Europe, where
there was a landscape that had already been
surveyed and tilled. In such a sphere he
could find room to place the nice problems of
conduct and conscience that interested him,
and work undisturbed by the roars of laugh-
ter that greeted the Yankee at the Court of
King Arthur. But, necessarily, the only
Europe he knew was the rather cosmopoli-
tan one presented to the tourist. There was
the social life of hotels and watering-places,
of the American colonies in Rome and
Florence, of ambassadorial circles in London
and Paris. The sort of life, indeed, that
attracts the serial writer by its glitter, and
repels the artist by its poverty! Yet no
mere subject-matter is altogether tabu, and
Henry James is not to be criticised for choos-
ing this. It was, indeed, almost forced upon
him, and might have yielded great results if
seen in the right perspective. Marcel Proust,
for instance, has created masterpieces out of
much the same material; but the weakness
of Henry Jones lay in the fact that he had
illusions about its richness, and even its
fundamental nature. It was an extremely
limited world for the artist; he believed it
was a peak with wide vistas. “I have be-
come, in all these years, as little provincial
as possible,” he wrote, when he was wallow-
ing in the depths of an extremely provincial
self-consciousness.
These cloistered pages of his shut out
something more than the comments of the
illiterate. Why do we feel that there is a
triviality about his work, in spite of the
elaborate art he brings to bear in shaping
it? The fact is that it lacks the one vital
element that is essential to creative work,
an element not easy to define. Call it poetry,
if you like, though that is a misleading word.
It is the element that relates the various
parts of life and unifies them —that preserves
the differences between people, the animal
kingdom, insentient things, and yet reveals
them as participants in a common mystery.
“I am a helplessly verseless creature,” James
once wrote to Stevenson. But Dickens, Tol-
stoi, Balzac and numberless other writers
were verseless, and yet had an essential
poetry in them that formed the source of
their creations. Henry James was without
it. The good fairies gave him every literary
quality except the most important one. His
Bernard Longuevilles, Stretherses, Roderick
Hudsons bear the same relation to human
beings as articles of furniture do to the living
tree from which they were carved. They have
no roots that go down into the ground, no
sap in their veins, no branches that reach
up to the sky. We admire the design and
intricacy of the carving, and we respect the
craftsman profoundly, but we cannot help
admitting that the product is wooden.
Would Henry James have been a great
novelist if he had been born in any other
environment, or if he had lived nearer the
earth? It is idle to ask such questions. All
that can be said is that there was a leak in
his creative power, and that a life of devotion
to his art could not make up for that.

Blake the Mystic
When one reads the poetical works of
William Blake and regards in the Art Gal-
lery the pictures he painted, and learns that
he was a mystic, then one feels like thank-
ing God that one was not born a mystic.
One begins to wonder, too, where madness
begins and mysticism ends. Also one
begins to wonder in the gallery why
these things that are neither artistic nor
beautiful, and which one would expect to
see on madhouse walls, were ever brought
into this place which is supposed to be a
palace of art and the home of beautiful
things. Amongst primitive people insanity
was, and is, usually regarded with feelings
of awe and reverence. The insane man is
enveloped in a sort of invisible cloud of mys-
tery. Meaning is given to his meaningless
acts and words, and he is accepted as a sort
of authority. He is supposed to commune
with spirits, and to be able to see into the
past and the future. Superstition quite fre-
quently makes his tongue oracular and him-
self a mouthpiece of the gods. But the
world of art is not supposed to be peopled by
primitive people. One cannot help thinking,
though, that there is a lot of the man-child
left in the people who do inhabit that world.
At any rate, they seem to have the same sort
of awe and reverence for anybody who wears
an air of mystery as the primitive man had
and has. William Blake wore such an air
of mystery. He wrote one or two very
tuneful lyrics, and one or two unforgettable
aphorisms; and some of his pictures have a
trace of beauty about them; but to compare
him with Michel Angelo as a painter, and
with Nietzsche as a thinker, as is frequently
done in the art world to-day, serves to show
how much of the primitive there is left in
that art world.
But the over-estimating of the importance
of the works of a man like Blake is not the
worst thing done by the authorities in
the art -world. Blake was a genuine
mystic. At least, he was genuinely mad.
But the authorities are often taken in by
quack mystics, imitation Blakes. Just as
the primitive people are imposed upon by
those apes of the insane, the witch-doctors
and medicine-men, who wear horns and feath-
ers, and dance weird dances, and perform
mystic rites, and do all manner of extra-
ordinary things to impress their watchers,
so the folk of the art world would seem to
be imposed upon frequently by clever people
who, like Hamlet, affect antic dispositions,
who play at being a little mad. Rudyard
Kipling, in “The Fabulists,” says that, no
matter what messages people have to deliver
to the world, they will not be heard unless
they please. But there is another way of
making oneself heard. One may inspire fear,
and the respect that is born of fear. Brown-
ing says if Moses had just pointed out the
spring to the people they would soon have
forgotten that it was he who discovered the
water for them. Moses was too wise for
that. He played the mystery man and smote
the rock. As Browning puts it:—
Oh, the crowd must have emphatic warrant!
Theirs the Sinai-forehead’s cloven brilliance,
Right arm’s rod sweep, tongue’s imperial flat.
Never dares the man put off the prophet.
If a man has a message to deliver to the
world he is perfectly justified in getting a
hearing for himself in any way he can. The
trouble is that there seem to be so many
people who have not got messages to deliver,
but are clever enough to see that, by putting
on the prophet, they can win to high place
in the art world. William Blake was cer-
tainly no such quack prophet. He did not
have to play the part of the eccentric insane
to impress. He was the part.
And it seems to me that we to understand
Blake would have to be as he was. If a
man. wine-intoxicated, could reproduce in
art form what he saw whilst so intoxicated,
then how meaningless would be the art forms
for him when he became sober! And if,
whilst we dream in sleep, we could shape
in lasting art-forms our dreams, then what
a meaningless, grotesque jumble of forms
we would see when we awoke from sleep!
The fevered brain of the sick man will pro-
vide even more distorted and mysterious
shapes than those seen by either the
drunkard or the dreamer. Yet in the
shapes of all the visions seen by men in such
a state, or by men intoxicated in any way,
will always be traces of shapes that they
have seen during their sober hours. Dreams
and visions can never be anything but dis-
torted memories. Devils and angels, vam-
pires and fairies, can never be anything
more than distorted, exaggerated, beautified
facts from the beholder’s own past. And the
original model is nearly always man. We
can be very sure that the angels Blake as
a boy saw in the trees were nothing more
than dimly-remembered impressions formed
in his mind while reading the Bible or the
verses of his favorite poets, or while listen-
ing to Biblical tales. And all the grotesque

and enormous figures that pose in such hid-
eous anguish in his pictures, and. that are
described in such horrible detail in his so-
called poetical works, we can be sure are
but the shadows of forms he once saw, enor-
mified, distorted, glorified. possibly in the
glow cast over them by his intoxicated imagi-
nation. If we drink enough wine we might
see the bunches of grapes the drunken sol-
diers saw in “Faust,” but if we do not drink
we will only see the purple noses of the
wine-drinking men. Blake saw the world
through a diseased mind. Quite possibly if
we had diseased minds we might, see it as
he saw it. Some modern critics are wont to
compare him with Nietzsche. What is not
understandable in Blake they put on a level
with that which they cannot understand in
Nietzsche. But between Blake and Nietzsche
there is the vast difference that, whereas
Nietzsche was a genius who went mad,
Blake, if he was a genius, was mad all the
days of his life.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Butler of the Notebooks
Samuel Butler, the author of "Erewkon”
and "The Way of All Flesh,” was a humor-
ist with a tang of vinegar in his breath,
rather than one who diffused an odor mingled
of roses and wine. But he was much more
than a humorist and a satirist; he was a
philosopher, a novelist, a scientist, and a
highly original translator and critic of the
so-called Homeric poems. lie worshipped
the genius of Handel, and labored indefati-
gably in musical composition. He composed
gavottes, minuets, fugues and many short
pieces for the piano, besides a cantata in the
Handelian form, entitled “Narcissus,” in
collaboration with Henry Festing Jones, He
was a rapturous admirer of the work of the
fifteenth-century Venetian artist, Giovanni
Bellini; and he enthusiastically took up the
study of art. He sent pictures to the exhi-
bitions of the Royal Academy, and his most
important work in oils, “Mr. Heatherley’s
Holiday,” is now in the National Gallery of
British Art. Butler energised in every
direction, striving to find complete expression
of his multiform intelligence.
Son of a clergyman of the Church of
England, and grandson of Dr. Samuel But-
ler, Bishop of Lichfield, at the age of 28 lie
began to develop rebelliously along agnostic
lines, and, diverging from Darwin, voiced the
opinions and the theories of a “somewhat
different” evolutionist. He scouted contem-
porary fame, but looked forward hopefully
to an immortality of three-score years and
ten after death, which happened 22 years
ago, and in the sixty-seventh year of his life.
The realisation of that posthumous fame is
still somewhat problematical, though George
Bernard Shaw has declared him to be “the
greatest English writer of the latter half of
the nineteenth century in his own depart-
men,” and “his own department” seems to
have embraced every variety of literature
and an important section of scientific and
philosophical speculation. The author of
"Erewhon” was, however, not only the son
of a clergyman and the grandson of a bishop,
lie himself was trained as a prospective
wearer of bands and cassock. He even went
1o London, after a brilliant exhibition at St.
John’s, Cambridge, and began to prepare for
ordination. He lived in Slumdom, and de-
voted himself to the drudgery of parish work
with characteristic energy. Then he began
to doubt the efficacy of infant baptism, and
finally declined to take holy orders. The
year following saw him on his way to Maori-
land, where he began sheepfarming in Can-
terbury, and contributed to the Press, a
journal still published in Christchurch.
Within five years he had enough of the
simple pastoral life; so he sold his holding,
and returned to London in company with
Charlies Paine Pauli, who thenceforward
attached himself to Butler in the character
of a financial leech.
A year after the appearance of “Erewhon”
lie published an ironical book, “The Fair
Haven”; and at intervals between them,
ranging from one to six years, “Life and
Habit,” “Evolution Old and New,” “Uncon-
scious Memory,” “Alps and Sanctuaries,”
“Luck or Cunning,” “Ex Voto,” “The
Humor of Homer,” “The Life and Letters of
Dr. Samuel Butler” (the author’s grand-
father), “The Authoress of the Odyssey,”
“The Iliad Rendered into English Prose,”
"Shakspeare’s Sonnets,” “The Odyssey
Rendered into English Prose,” and “Ere-
whon Revisited.” Besides, Butler wrote
a number of articles for the periodical press,
composed musical pieces, painted in oils, and
drew illustrations for certain of his travel
books. In 1897 occurred the death of the
sponger and ingrate, Pauli, who had been so
long and so munificently benefacted by But-
ler. “Erewhon Revisited” was published
in 1901. This was his last work of import-
ance : he died on June 18, 1902.
Butler’s friend, admirer, intimate com-
panion, frequent co-worker and biographer,
Henry Festing Jones, published 18 years
after the author’s death the “Notebooks” of
this complex personality, and so admitted
the pubfic into his intellectual work-
shop. From the days of his youth Butler
carried with him a notebook, for the record-
ing of his thoughts, impressions, overheard
chance conversations, and wayside incidents
of suggestion or illustration. In his own
phrase: “One’s thoughts fly so fast that one
must shoot them: it is no use trying to put
salt on their tails.” When he was about
40 he began to index his notes, classifying,
rejecting and re-writing. At the age of 56
he tackled the task afresh, and regularly
spent an hour every morning in re-editing
and indexing his omnium-gatherum.
Jones did not publish the Notebooks as
Butler left them, in all their gloriously
chaotic confusion, with Handel cheek-by-
jowl with the “Babes in the Wood” panto-
mime, an hotel memorandum squeezed be-
tween a philosophical reflection and a recipe
for a sheep-wash. He classified, edited and
rejected, getting rid of the merely temporary
and exclusively personal in the small sense;
and he arranged the notes under specific
beads. They range from one line, or a part
of one line, to over four pages, as, for in-
stance, the brilliant essayette on “Genius.”
Some are flamingly vital, or like live sparks,
which should be kept far away from a barrel
of thought-gunpowder. Indeed, there is an
explosive quality in a vast deal of this
arresting book; and there is a lot of
sheer “crankiness.” Butler could reason,
and did reason, as closely as) a mediae-
val schoolman; but he could also be
as perverse and as eclectic, in his fads and
his fancies, as a miss nursing an immatui’e
romance, or a fine lady with the vapors. But
he is always interesting, and always stimu-
lating—even when he decries Raffaelle and
denounces Beethoven. Some of his one- or
two-line thoughts, impressions, aphorisms, arc
gems of condensation :
Manners makyth man:' yes, but they make woman
still more.
I ran generally bear the separation; but I don’t
like the leave-taking.
Common chords: If man is the tonic and God the
dominant, the Devil is certainly the sub-dominant and.
Woman is the relative minor.

within a wall of w-ords.
Definitions are a kind of scratching and generally
leave a sore plaee more sore than it was before.
As Love is too young to know what, conscience is,,
so Truth and Genius are too old to know what
definition is.
He had not much conscience, and what little he
had was guilty.
He is greatest who is most often in men’s good
thoughts.
The evil that men do lives after them. Yes, and a
good! deal of the evil that they never did as well.
The great characters of fiction live as truly as the
memories of dead men: For the life after death it
is not necessary that a man or a woman should have
lived.
Our ideas; They are for the most part like bad
sixpences, and we spend our lives' in trying to pass
them on one another.
Homeric commentators have been blind so long that
nothing wilK do for them but Homer must be blind
too. They have transferred their own blindness to
the poet.
Here is a note that is a little longer, and is
dedicated especially to the experts and the
exponents of formal and conventional educa-
tion of the higher type:—
Schools and colleges are not intended to foster
genius and to bring it out. Genius is a nuisance, and
it is the duty of schools and colleges to abate it by
setting genius-traps in its way. They are as the
artificial obstructions in a hurdle race —tests of skill
and endurance, but in themselves useless. Still, so
necessary is it that genius and originality should be
abated that, did not academies exist, we should have
had to invent them.
The volume includes some items which are
not actually in the “Notebooks, the longest
being two articles entitled “Darwin Among
the Machines” and “Lucubratio Ebria.
Other items are two free-verse chants, both
as caustic and satiric as Butler could make
them.
FRED J. BROOMFIELD.
Where Away, Padre!
“When Authority calls one way—along
some autiquated lane, all weed-w 7 orn and
rutty—and Reality beckons _ from another,
you must follow the latter.” So said the
Padre, a gaunt, war-battered figure, “cadav-
erous with sleeplessness and overwork,
blown “like a gust” into the underground
shelter of a young lieutenant of the Royal
Engineers stationed somewhere in the Ypres
salient. Subsequently the Padre lost his life
in the battle of Passchendaele, but the
youngster survived and, in fulfilment of a
promise given to the dead man, entered on a
mission of “life giving.” The Great. War
was over and the day had come when, in the
Padre's dream, all the great thoughts that
had accumulated in those awful years of sac-
rifice were free “to break forth and disturb
the outworn order.” Many can recall such
thoughts, such hopes, hopes made passion-
ately intense by strain on the heart-strings
of countless fathers, mothers and kin. From
the blood-drenched fields of France were to
spring the white flowers of universal peace
and world-wide brotherhood. It was with
such high hopes that Hilary Down, the
flaxen-haired, blue-eyed youngster, disciple
of the battered old Padre, set out to achieve
his high end. The story is told in Wander-
light, by Ernest Raymond. Hilary turned
to the Church as the fittest instrument for
his pui'pose, and graduated in the theological
course. On the eve of ordination he with-
drew. He had found in the services of the
church he still loved not only “so much that
is grand,” but “so much that is unreal.”
Nearly six years have passed since the
“cease firing” was sounded, and to-day the
heathen rage as ever, and still envy, hatred,
malice and all uncharitableness rend the
hearts of men. The Church had its great
opportunity. Has its influence on the issue
been negligible, or largely so, because it
offered as a solvent of the wickedness in
men’s hearts “so much that is. unreal”?
The same point, “unreality,” crops up in
an interesting triology by Compton Mac-
kenzie. Since the days in 1888, when Mrs.
Humphry Ward’s “Robert Elsmere” flut-
tered the dovecot of evangelical England,
tfiere have been these sporadic outbursts of
theological literary fiction. The theme has,
seemingly, an ever-recurrent interest. In
this case Compton Mackenzie, with his meti-
culous care in detail, has found it necessary
to carry his pilgrim through progressive
stages from “The altar steps” to “The heav-
enly ladder.” In the intermediate stage, “The
parson’s progress,” his central figure passes
through an experience in the religious life of
the Anglo-Catholic section of the Established
Church, where ritualism apes Rome to the
limit of servility. In this intensely artificial
atmosphere the parson, or, rather, priest,
lost himself in the fog of unreality. On
every side obscure symbolism substituted
itself for the living soul of things. The con-
fessional box where he daily officiated seemed
to him “to drip with hysterical tears and
the air to reek with the subtly self-indulgent
and lying and perfumed breath of femi-
nality.” He became for the time being the
complete sceptic. “The moment I leave the
altar or the box I do not believe in any-
thing. I am as sceptical of evolution as I
am sceptical of the resurrection.... I am scep-
tical of the existepce of myself.” Unreality
had poisoned his outlook on life.
Joseph Conrad in one of his novels creates
a character who adopts towards life the
attitude of an onlooker. He sees it as one
sees a play on the stage of the theatre. Such
an attitude could not be maintained; he was
drawn inevitably into the action of life itself.
Yet it is possible, from time to time, for
men to withdraw themselves from the action
of “the passing show,” and look at it in a
dry light. It is then one is inclined to ask
“Can men believe these unreal things?” We
arc in the twentieth century since the
Nazarene, in-4 group of very simple-minded,
single-souled men, preached a very simple
gospel. It was not new; before his time
philosophers had said as much, though claim-
ing less. It was not new, indeed, because it
lives inherent at the bases of all society,
giving an impetus to what society may yet
become. Man cannot live for himself alone,
so preached the Christ; and the deeper the
love of man for his fellow-men the nearer
wc come to the perfect societas. Men recog-
nise this in their hearts, their homes, their
daily work, their laws. It is very simple,
but: it is absolute and real. The load of
ecclesiastical trappings, dogmas, doctrines,
rituals, vestments and the rest seems to have
obscured, almost hidden, the simple teach-
ing of the Man who gave to Christianity its
name.
Where away, Padre! Your people are call-
ing for something real —and you have it at
your hand.
T. B. C.
Critics and Confessions.
T have been a close reader of, but a rare
contributor to, critical literature. In 1895)
Henry Lawson wrote a pessimistic article on
the Red Page about Australian writers. He
concluded his essay by advising this un-
wanted variation of homo sapiens to exter-
minate itself carefully with the aid of a
revolver and a mirror. I ventured to dis-
agree with Henry. He accepted some of my
remarks as personal, and hurtingly gave me
the high shoulder next Saturday morning at
the office counter. Thereafter he declined to
converse with me for nearly 12 months.
Then I ran into him accidentally in Hunter-
street one fine beery morning. He grinned
and put out his hand, we adjourned without
explanation or apology, and that was our
only serious quarrel. It put me off critical
writing.
I am not much of a critic, anyhow. To
this day I cannot endure Meredith or Brown-
ing. To me D. 11. Lawrence is indubitably
insane. I take pleasure in the Bible, par-
ticularly the Psalms and the sad and inno-
cent story of Lot's mistaken daughters.
Zane Grey holds me in thrall from the first
report of the incomparable cow-girl's pistol
to the last explosion of the two-gun man’s big
.44 When I go to town T spend most of my
spare time in picture theatres. If the Ameri-
cans did not own nine-tenths of the film
factories and most of the picture theatres in
the world, I would spend the rest of my spare
time constructing Australian photo-plays.
Unfortunately, we have not yet passed the
period when Australians are regarded as a
mere by-product of Australia.
As far as I can see, the “literary” light
has brought out two species of writers —
those who write and those who write about
what writers write. A sub-order of the latter
genus is composed of those who write about
writers. Some of these latter have two hol-
low teeth in front, forked tails and bifur-
cated feet.
It is a mistake to think that literary
geniuses must have brains. I have known a
great many, and a suspicion haunts me that
faculty is their strong suit, not brains. I
began to write when I was nine ; I wrote for
newspapers at 15. and I am still writing at 55,
I confess to having published verses, songs,
stories, sketches and eleven books issued
from Australian and English presses. Being
still procreative, I hope for further issue.
Yet if I were called to the Judgment Seat I
could not say why I write, nor if anything
I have written is worth a twopenny damn.
I suspect that most critics could not say
either.
I used to read all sorts of expert opinions
and highbrow pronouncements about Litera-
ture, until. I grew bone-tired. They never
led me anywhere, as far as my work was con-
cerned. They never helped me or enlight-
ened me, even though some of them were writ-
ten by erudite book-people with university
degrees and academic claims to wisdom.
Victor Daley, Rod Quinn and I talked a
great deal together in the old days. It is a
curious thing—and I remember it now—that
our conversations were more about Life than
Literature. There were certain books and
poems that we liked; we accepted them as
fine; mayhap we quoted passages, especially
from the poets, but we seemed to let it go
at that. Daley was a bookish bard, but
after years of intimate association I fail to
recall any one memorable pronouncement of
his on literature. Quinn is a born litterateur,
a singer with harmonious gifts. I recall that
in youth he fell to Tennyson for a time, and
I know he thought “Lorna Doone” was a
glorious book. When he read his “Camp
Within the West” from new-laid manuscript
to me on Curl Curl beach one blue morning
lang syne he looked pleased and surprised
when I reared myself up from the sand under
a rock where we were lounging, and informed
him. in all belief, that it was a mighty poem.
It is as good a poem to-day as when he
wrote it. But how was he to know? He was
only the writer of the durned thing. The
critics claim to know. T wonder?
The worst critic probably has a closer per-
sonal knowledge of literature than the best
writer. That is why I mistrust their judg-
ment. Most of my own critics have been
kind. That is why I am uneasy. After all,
the final appeal may be to Caesar.
Arc Caesar! Te morituri militant. Likewise
(as fashions and generations change), Le
rot cst mort! Vive le roi!
[Unstable and spasmodic as Caesar is re-
ported to be, I have a secret “saver” on him
for the Immortality Stakes.]
E. J. BRADY.
The Callahans and the Murphys, by Kathleen
Norris (lieinemanu). A book of delightful short
stories, many, of which ran through the Metropoli-
tan. Very lovable are the two clans of Insh-Ameri-
cans, as racy of Clare and of Mayo even to the
third generation as though tiiey had never heard of
New York’s Flat-iron or Coney Island.
Savage Life in Central Australia, by G. Horne and
G. Aiston (Macmillan). An interesting volume
dealing with the habits, crafts, myths, magic and
rites of the Wonkonguru and their neighbors in the
country eastward of Lake Eyre, among whom Dr.
Horne’s collaborator has spent a number of years as
a S.A. mounted policeman. Most of the facts in-
corporated have been collected by him at first hand
from old natives, and a valuable service has been
done in setting them on record, because time and
the aborigines’ contact with the whites are making
it more and more difficult to get untainted informa-
tion. The volume is not so exhaustive as those of
Dr. Howitt and Spencer and Gillen, but it supple-
ments thorn at many points and generally is well
worthy to stand beside them.

This offers a delightful test which
will bring a new conception of what
clean teeth mean.
It means Whiter, cleaner, safer
teeth, such as millions now enjoy.
See what it brings to you.
The war on film
Dental science is now fighting film
—the cause of most tooth troubles.
Film is that yiscous coat you feel.
It clings to teeth.. Under old methods
of tooth brushing, much of it remains.
It becomes discoloured, then forrr s
dingy coats. That is why so many
teeth look cloudy.
Film also causes most tooth
troubles. It holds food substance
which ferments and forms acid. It
holds the acid in contact with the
teeth to cause decay. Germs breed
by millions in it. They, with tartar,
are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
These troubles became almost
universal when that film was left on
teeth.
Modern research has discovered
two effective film combatants. One
disintegrates the film at all stages
of formation. One removes it with-
out harmful scouring.
Tests have proved that these
methods mean a new era in teeth
cleaning. A new-type tooth paste

Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.
has been created to apply them daily.
The name is Pepsodent.
Now the use of Pepsodent has
spread the world over, largely by
dental advice
Look at what Pepsodent
does
The use of Pepsodent will bring
at cnce a new conception of clean
teeth.
It does more than fight film. It
multiplies the alkalinity of the saliva
which is there to neutralize mouth
acids. It multiplies the ptyalin in
saliva, which is there to digest starch
deposits on teeth.
These combined effects will be a
revelation to you.
Send the coupon for a io-Day
Tube. Note how clean the teeth
feel after using. Mark the absence
of the viscous film! See how teeth'
become whiter as the film-coats

Your home I plan—a paradise below —
.V home in which you'll be the honored
king;
A little edrner into which I’ll .bring
The atmosphere that you have come to know
And love so well; a sanctuary aglow
With thoughts of love, where not one jar-
ring thing
Shall make a discord, but where you shall
fling
Aside all cares that our twin souls may grow.
A place of calm where you can come at night
After the toil and weariness of day,
To us the throbbing heart of all the earth ;
A little nest of ease and warmth and light,
Where harmony and love delight to stay
And rule alike our sorrow aud our mirth.

Her eyes are shadow lands
Of memories,
Of skies and sunny sands
And dreaming seas,
Of youth and young desire;
All these shall, too,
Awaken with their lire
Of joy or rue.
I ask no more than this.
That they may hold.
When Time has cloyed the kiss
And we are old,
The laughter and the tears
That we have known.
Not lost along the years
Though softer grown,
To keep the sweet refrain
That young hearts sing
For age to sing again
Remembering.

Two Sonnets.
I.
Cold is my heart with fear. If I should die
And leave you here alone —if you should go
And 1 remain before our love burns low
And many years slip mercifully by
Blunting our sharp desires —I think that I,
Or you, whiehe’er was left, would never
know
The heart of life again. Long days would
flow —
Long, evil days and days—relentlessly.
Yet rather than the stealthy years which
brush
Their blurring fingers over ev'ry mark
Which went to make up life, my whole beart
cries
For a mad ending—storm before the hush.
Swiftly, together, let us greet the dark,
Seeking no light save in each other's eyes.
II.
If we might die together I should know
That all my time I held you ; for to me
This green enchanted earth is mystery
And battle-ground enough. To watch the
slow
Red lire of dawn set all the world aglow
Allures me more than Immortality.
Because of this I hold you jealously,
Knowing I cannot follow where you go.
And in some far-off Spring, when we are
dead
And the sun's rapture glorifies the days.
When wanton, soulless Nature loves to fling
Her gifts, and Beauty wakes beneath her
tread,
I shall be lonely in the grassy ways,
Looking for you amid the blossoming.

Lupin Love.
I heard Pan in a field of lupins
Pipe dolefully.
High and sweet stood the yellow lupins,
Taller than he;
And his saffroned fluting among the lupins
Came beckoning me.
No word he said, but his silver sighing
Shone in the air:
And like a bird his kiss went flying
Within my hair
And woke my mouth and set it crying
A new tune there.
I went from Pan through the field of lupins,
Sorcery-wise.
His flute went calling among the lupins
For new replies:
And strange wild ghosts of golden lupins
Haunted my eyes.

At the year's call
There shall be bread.
After long strife
Shall the prize of life
Grow from the dead.
If the world perish,
What that I cherish
Would seem good to me?
The living and the dying
Are a brave crying
After things to be.
By the faith that is ours
Shall be the powers
Of those who come after.
Let the sighing and the sinning
And the losing and the winning
Be the seed of laughter I

A FUTILE RAILWAY REPORT.
Two imported experts of memorable tonnage,
employed* to report on the State rail-
way system of N. S. Wales, have
evolved the usual document which isn’t
expected to make any serious differ-
ence. Certainly there are a few recom-
mendations which might mean something if
honestly adopted. Thus it is suggested that
the railway revenue and expenditure shall be
taken out of the general accounts, and that
the railway debt shall be kept in a separate
account, to be looked after by the railway
management itself. This would at least give
the community a better chance to know how
much of the public debt is. not represented
by this allegedly substantial kind of “perma-
nent and reproductive work.” It might even
lead some to a dim understanding of how
much State liability isn’t represented by
anything at all of a tangible or payable
nature. The removal of the lines from poli-
tical control is also a recommendation; one
always looks for it in a case of the sort,
and . never expects it .to. lead to much. It is
quite simple for directors or commissioners
to control the lines; but someone must con-
trol the directors, else they might sell the
whole show and retire on the proceeds. They
can’t be controlled by meetings of share-
holders, for two million shareholders, or
even 200,000, as in the case of Tasmania,
are too many to get into one apartment.
No matter what is done, politicians are,
therefore, likely to remain the ultimate court
of appeal. Likewise decentralisation of rail-
way control has been often recommended, and
will be recommended again; yet there isn't
the least prospect that it will be anything
more than a pretence, if it even gets so far
as being that, unless the big State is cut.
into three or four, thus decentralising the
politicians. The essential thing is to alter
the whole policy. of construction so as to
direct the trade of much of the interior to
new ports and new coastal cities, and cut
the needless haulage down to a minimum.
While the entire Government is concentrated
in one overwhelming city no railway manage-
ment is likely to be allowed to do that un-
less it is given such autocratic power that
it could do anything with the railways up
to the point of embezzling the lot. And
even that might not be decisive. The poli-
ticians who granted the authority might
take it away again.
* * #*
The N. S. Wales railway report up to
.Tune. 1924, had some points of interest. It
specified 58 lines or sections which failed
to pay expenses and interest, against 54 in
1923. They amounted in the aggregate to
3545 miles, whereas a year earlier the insol-
vents extended to only 3134 miles. That
left only 1978 miles of railway which paid
their in 1923 as many as 2134
miles t&d/fco'A The natural deduction is that
none of tliVv new mileage opened during the
year is self-supporting, and that part of the
mileage previously opened has slipped back
among the insolvents and loafers. Twenty-
seven lines are in the position that they
earn none of their interest bill, and only
part of their, working expenses, so they have
attained such a low-water mark of poverty
that their abandonment would be a positive
cash saving, though the interest bill would
remain as a permanency. Some of them are
rare specimens, such as one of less than two
miles in length which earned under £4OOO
inside 12 months, and spent close on £lB.OOO
in the effort. It is -customary to describe
such undertakings as “developmental,” the
idea being that they have a future. One
veteran, which pays no interest and only
part of its working charges, will have been
waiting for its luck to turn for 60 years
when next December arrives. The toss on
the-58 unpayables for last financial- year
was £1,207,824, being about £104,500-. more
than in the year previous. In the year to
.Tune, 1919, the loss on similar lines (about
700 miles less of them then) was
£672,457; so the situation is not improving.
The last dozen lines built all took their
places automatically in the list. Yet aver-
age freights in 1924 were 11s. sd. per ton
for 100 miles, against 7s. lid. in 1919. The
haul also tends to cover more miles, as well
as to cost more per mile, as scanty settle-
ment goes further out. The average dis-
tance over which wheat was carried in 1919
was 177 miles, but it had risen to 238 miles
by 1924. The capital in unpayable railways
which appear quite hopeless while the pre-
sent system lasts is about £28,000,000.
* * * *
It is customary in fossilised circles to oppose
the construction of the great South-to-North
railway on financial grounds, though the de-
velopment of a Federal estate of over half a
million square miles depends on it, to say
nothing of the national existence of Austra-
lia, which must take formal possession of the
empty two-thirds of the continent—or one
day lose it. Sham patriots, who hold all
Federal expenditure as waste unless the
money is laid out on the crowded streets
which surround their own interests, profess
that the two severed parts of the line now
working are something phenomenal in the
way of money-losers, and that the completed
transcontinental would necessarily be the
same. Wherefore they urge the abandon-
ment or indefinite postponement of pioneer-
ing, and proceed to roll some local log at
national expense instead. Yet if the Port
Augusta-Oodnadatta and Darwin-Katherine
River lines were located in N. S. Wales they
would be just ordinary happenings. The
Demondrille-Blayney railway in the Ma State
is the longest of the 27 utter bankrupts,
measuring 111 miles, while the Darwin-
Katherine concern measures 200 miles and
the Oodnadatta line is 478 miles long, and
they compare thus for last year in a finan-
cial sense:—
Deficit
on Working Total
Expenses. Interest. Deficit.
Oodnadatta line . . £60,411 £77,236 £137,647
Per mile . . 126 161 287
N. Territory line 15,149 54,855 70,004
Per mile • .. 76 274 350
Demcndrille-Blaynev 33,445 68,751 102,196
Per mile . . 304 625 929
And N. S. Wales has lines which lose more
for their size than Demondrille-Blayney. It
is simply the longest individual specimen.
N. S. Wales makes 1978 miles of solvent
railway pay, in overcharges, for the loss on
3545 miles of insolvent railway. The de-
ficits are necessarily, to a great extent, a
burden, on Sydney interests, and the burden
is growing; also it is likely to grow. The
question demands attention, then, whether it
is worth Sydney’s while to cultivate this bur-
den, even if its people are able to boast in
consequence that they live in a very big and
fast-growing and rather slummy city, where
houses are hard to get and the traffic problem
has become a nightmare. Three unhopeful
circumstances are that the area under crop
is less than it was seven and eight and nine
years ago; that the mere handful of persons
employed in factories outside Sydney is
definitely on the decrease; and that shipping,
so far as outside ports are concerned, has
reached a point at which the ocean com-
merce of three fine harbors, Twofold Bay,
Jervis Bay and Port Stephens, lately
amounted to one small ship for the year—not
one ship each, but one among them. That
last is the sort of thing which doesn’t hap-
pen in countries where the sane and almost
universal policy is followed of giving access
to every harbor which is worth while. The
problems on which the pair of costly experts
were- invited to give the benefit of their ex-
perience did not include this grotesque item,
but their thoughts concerning it must have
been numerous and interesting.
THE THREATENED ATOLL.
A drought threatened China recently.
Drought in Australia endangers the lives of
sheep and cattle; in China it spells star-
vation and death to millions of human
beings. The usual measures were applied to
avert the terror. To apprise the gods of
the seriousness of the situation, their images
in the temples were severely smacked and
their stomachs painted red to simulate sun-
burn. Still, the sun shone pitilessly from
a cloudless sky on fields baked to a dusty
brown. As a last resource, the famous rain-
making tablet of Hantan hsieu was brought
out and carried in procession through the
country. As soon as it had completed the
circuit, rain fell. It fell to such purpose
that in a few days fields, villages and cities
were inundated and two million people were
rendered homeless. The Chinese hailed this
visitation as proof of the Hantan tablet’s
superabundant powers and waited patiently
for the flood to subside so that they could
return to their devastated fields to plough
and plant again. Foreign experts, how-
ever, long ago pointed out the. cause of both
the drought and the deluge. In the days
when China was covered with magnificent
forest, these twin demons had not made their
appearance. Successive; human generations
ate up the natural growth, until there were
few trees left except those that grew on
grave mounds and in the royal parks. Re-
publican indifference allowed the last to be
consumed; and now the Chinese farmer' lies
naked to the elements —wind, rain and sun
play giant sport with him. The iron con-
servatism of his history has been explained
in a score of ways, but probably its real
cause is to be looked for in this exposure
to natural forces' stronger than himself. On
his seaboard Western science has arrived to
reinforce him in the fight, and there he has
abandoned his conservatism; but even West-
ern science cannot reclothe the millions of
devastated hills which once maintained the
climatic balance for him.
* * * *
It is the same in kind if not in degree in
other lands. Part of India is suffering
from a frightful inundation. Vast areas of
Europe that once supplied Rome with the
timber for her homes and galleys are now
grey deserts supporting a few semi-barbarous
shepherds. The remains of Assyrian and
Egyptian cities testify to the existence of
great civilisations where now the simple
nomad roams. They built in stone, but the
basis of their life was timber. They used
up their forests and the sand claimed their
•culture. Even in our day no substitute has
befen found for timber. Our architects think
in steel and ferro-concrete; but the builder
thinks first in terms of wood. The age of
steel, instead of decreasing the demand for
timber, has actually increased it, and every
new industry and every issue of a newspaper
help to diminish the supply. N. S. Wales
consumed- A 5 million more feet of timber
in 1928 than in the previous year. Forestry
experts calculate that at the present rate
of consumption the resources of the U.S.A.
will be exhausted by 1970. The fiercest
efforts to make up the wastage by replanting
may postpone the famine another five years.
The forest countries which have been supply-
ing the world’s dearth arc beginning to take
stock of their dwindling assets. They look
at their stripped hillsides from which the
soil is slipping, note their diminishing rain-
fall and the growing capricousness of their
rivers, and talk about restriction.
* * * *
Australian experts realise the acuteness
of the situation, and forestry commissions in
every State battle with the problem; but
in the absence of a forest conscience amongst
the people, politicians can afford to starve
them. Last, year Queensland made a profit
of £llO,OOO out of its forests —and put back
£5000! In 1923 the Forestry Commission
of N. S. Wales, owing to insufficiency of
funds, planted a mere 1625 acres in coni-
fers ; in the same year this prodigal State
imported £2,413,159 worth from countries
that are already regretting their benevolence.
Maoriland once supplied the world with
kauri; now a kauri tree is a museum curio-
sity. The Northern Rivers district of N. S.
Wales was once among the finest forest
regions of the world. Pines stood there
280 feet high in their boots; cedars with
60,000 feet of timber in them flourished in
the splendid gorges of the Dorrigo ; enormous
hardwoods covered the plains. For genera-
tions the bullocky has been urging his slow-
footed team up the mountain roads; to-day
motor-tractors hurry the work of devastation.
Everyone does his bit. The suburbanite
roots the trees out of his half-acre because
they are “such dirty livers”; the farmer
ringbarks the road-belt outside his fence
because it steals nourishment from his crop.
No country has plundered its forests more
light-heartedly than Australia, and no coun-
try has more need of them. Pedants argue
hotly as to whether Australia should be
called a continent or an island. It is best
described as an atoll. An atoll of fertility
girdling a comparatively dry lagoon. Every
tree destroyed in the encircling oasis re-
duces the quantity of moisture which reaches
the desert: the increasing aridity of the
desert checks the arrival of wet ocean winds.
There are no great mountain ranges inland to
redress the balance annually with their
melting snow. People talk glibly of popula-
tions of 50 millions or 100 millions on this
atoll of precarious fertility. The problem
of the future may be how to sustain civili-
sation on it at all.
THE OLD COUNTRY.
There is a very definite sense in which Eng-
land is the oldest country of all. Many lands of
extreme antiquity show something of modern
organisation on the very spot where ancient
development was greatest ; but these coun-
tries have known long breaks of desolation
and savagery in their checkered history.
There is no hint of relationship between
modern Cairo and ancient Thebes; and Jeru-
salem of the Middle Ages was no more like
the Zion of David than a blackfellow's camp
is like Collins-street. The overthrow of the
Roman Empire tossed all Europe into the
melting-pot ; • and’ out of the confusion that
followed, Eneland most rapidly assumed a
new and. permanent organisation. Ad-
mitting the havoc wrought by the Saxon
invasion, the fact stands that England be-
came England under an organised and elec-
tive government in the middle of the nintn
century, and that this government has oeen
continuous. No other country can sil °
anything like this record. China has be
broken in pieces by foreign invasion several
times since Egbert came to the n est oaxou
throne; Ireland, with genuine historic re-
cords dating beyond the fifth century, has
suffered almost complete anarchy for ion„
periods; England can show nearly 11 cen-
turies during which her fields never wem
out of cultivation, the law never ceased to
be respected, and her unity as a I ower was
never doubted. France, though remotely
connected with the old Frankish Empire, only-
possessed a nominal rule over her present
territories four or five centuries later ; Spam
took her present shape about six centuries
later; United Italy is a thing of yesterday;
Prussia was only in the germ in the days
when England had begun to assert the rights
of the people through Parliament.
The antiquity of the British monarchy is
no less remarkable than-the antiquity or the
settled organisation. The third Norman
king links up with the old Saxon Ame;_ the
Stuarts are of the Scottish royalty ; and
there is also a definite, link with the Irish
ruling families. No other line can establish
such a claim; it is to be doubted whether
such a claim could ever have been made in
any land. If at times the English people
have tolerated their monarclis instead of
honoring them, they have at least been able
to feel that the existence of the line was a
proof of their own moderation, patience and
willingness to develop along the path of
national safety. Tennyson's “seed ot free-
dom sown betwixt a people and their ancient
throne” is not altogether a myth. Take the
ages through, there lias been less killing in
England than in any European country ; and
freedom in its first call to humanity has
largely meant freedom from violent death.
The few civil wars which the country lias
known were affairs between parties and poli-
tical interests, and did not seriously inter-
fere with the harvest nor interrupt the trade
of London. At Naseby. the most important
battle against the Stuart despotism, the Par-
liamentary army' came within an ace of de-
struction before Cromwell turned a rout
into a victory ; yet the total loss of the anti-
royalists was only 500 men. The hangings
of rebels in Monmouth’s insurrection-
stated falsely by Macaulay at 5000 —are
shown by the Somerset House records to
have been less than 100. Compare these
figures with those of Continental warfare,
and it is not difficult to understand why Eng-
land has refrained from impatience over an-
cient institutions which have apparently be-
come obsolete.
* * * *
Hupian experiments can only be proved
by results over enormous stretches of time:
and of men is by way of being
an experiment. Taking this as a
basis, . Britain is the most successful
experiment to date; and the fact is
thrown into high relief by r the comparison of
the offshoot in America. With a virgin
continent for a field, but making a complete
break with older institutions, the people of
the United States have never quite succeeded
in preserving the personal safety which is
the basis of freedom. In a century and a
half of independence they have once been rent
by a civil war which was infinitely more
murderous than all the civil wars of Eng-
land through all the ages. The American
Constitution is wholly different from that of
Britain. Much of the hurriedly-made
machinery is cumbersome, even dangerous ; the
political organisation of the land lives only
by grace of an English tradition of patience
which has not yet been exhausted. France,
from the time of the first revolution, strug-
gled with the business of national organisa-
tion without real success until the over-
throw of the third empire. A ready-made
Constitution which would bend without break-
ing had not been found : but the new repub-
lic was modelled to a large extent on the
British system, and has stood unshaken ever
since. The French President is now prac-
tically a limited monarch, elected for a term,
and not dependent on the fluctuations of
parties for his office. No one can be blind
to the faults of the English organisation,
to the clumsiness of much of the machinery,
to the pretences of ancient things that creep
out of their dark hiding-places at crownings
and royal burials, to the shoddy remnants
of former pomps and shows ridiculous in the
age of aeroplanes and wireless. Yet, despite
the congestion of cities, the increase of popu-
lation beyond the natural carrying capacity
of the land and all the other handicaps, life
and liberty are still more secure in Eng-
land than in any of the other countries, ex-
cept those newly-settled areas which still
follow the English way and which contain
people of British descent.
These facts are of vast importance to a
Commonwealth like Australia, which might
be looked upon as a good ground for experi-
ment. With the English foundation of
national organisation we had a good jump-
ing-off ground for legitimate reform ; but at
the very beginning of our Federal life we
made the blunder of following the pattern
shown in America by keeping our original
States in the form in which Federation found
them. Nearly all the friction and delay
which has since arisen has been due
to this cause. National organisation,
which is centred in the Constitution
but has its foundations in precedent,
custom and a thousand unwritten laws, is
not a matter of clever planning and sudden
creation. It grows naturally out of the life
of the people and their daily needs; and
though the tree requires careful pruning
from age to, age, the great boughs, once
shaped, preserve the main form. To saw
off any of them may lead to unexpected con-
sequences. We are of British stock, reared
in British tradition, more genuinely English
in many ways than the English themselves,
and heirs to the long and successful Eng-
lish experiment. To patiently adapt that Eng-
lish experiment to our needs, keeping always
the idea of personal security foremost, is our
safe course. Much that goes under the noisy
name of imperialism is false to the English
idea, foreign in both shape and sentiment:
but the great experiment, as seen by Alfrep
and Chatham and Gladstone- •and Deakin.
still goes on. It is not an experiment in
soil or in marketing produce, but an experi-
ment in the bigger sphere of man. For that


reason it is as applicable to Alice Springs
as to Berkshire, as well tested for the hsorth-
ern Territory as for Birmingham. The hrst
necessity of any system of national organisa
tion is that it shall be instinctive to the race.
People with the English tradition feel the
English way, and can walk along it m the
darkest hour. That is why it gets some-
where and why foreign roads are dangerous
to us.
A TALE OF ANCIENT WRONG.
The murder of an American Consul by a
Persian mob, the employment of 800 Rus-
sian auxiliaries by a Manchurian general
and the seizure of a European ship at Cape-
town full of munitions for Asiatic rebels are
recent evidences that the character of the
squabble between East and West has not
changed. Who first started it is not quite
clear and it never assumed any importance
until the establishment of the Greek civilisa-
tion made Europe worth preserving for pos-
terity • but even at that early date it showed
the usual features. When the Greek armies
chased the Persian power back into Asia
Minor, the Greek communities they had set
out to liberate from the Asiatic yoke fought
on the Persian side. Later, when the East
came back in a more gigantic wave than
ever before and nearly succeeded in sub-
merging Europe under a deluge of yellow
nomadism, European gunners organised the
invaders’ primitive artillery. During the
course of that invasion Russia was Oriental-
ised, with results still apparent in our day,
and the rest of Europe was only saved from
sharing the same fate by the death of the
great nomad who directed the swarming, the
customary quarrel amongst his descendants
over the succession causing a sudden with-
drawal, and leaving Europe time to breathe
again. She profited by the Armistice to
such effect that within two centuries she
was sending her navies flying round the
capes of the world in a great flanking move-
ment against her old antagonist.
At that time, according to the records of
the old navigators themselves, the Pacific
deserved its name. The seas of Asia were
apparently free to the commerce of all
nations. Turks traded with Chinese, Chinese
with Indians. There were largo Arab col-
onies in China and Hindu settlements in
Java, and when the European came he was
welcomed with a simple trustfulness that
argued long immunity from war’s unplea-
santnesses. How the European reciprocated
is indicated by the doings of the humane
Dalboquerque, first viceroy of the Portu-
gese Empire of the East. In his earliest intru-
sion into the East Indies Alfonso chased,
caught and pillaged four peaceful Indian
traders, one Javanese, one from the Coro-
mandel Coast, another of an unknown
nationality and “a very rich junk,” presum-
ably out of China. Arrived at Malacca,
then the emporium of the East, he decided
that “Our Lord desired to make an end of
him (the Sultan of Malacca) for good and
all, and to cast the Moors out of the land,
and to have His gospel preached in these
regions, and their mosques transformed into
houses of God’s praise:” so he “gave orders
for an attack with armed boats and two
large barges with heavy bombards.” The
result of the pious enterprise was that 800
Portuguese freebooters captured the famous
city of 100,000 inhabitants, and “of the
Moors, women and children, there died by
the sword an infinite number, for no quarter
was given to any of them.”
For a generation or so, except for a few
renegade Portuguese at Indian Courts there
was unity amongst these European distur-
bers of Asia’s peace; but only because the
pioneering nation had no competitors. In
1592 the Englishman Lancaster came
cruising into the Straits of Malacca in a
tiny ship with a crew “of which not 22 were
found for labor and helpe.” With this
armada he did not scruple to attack three
ships, “one of which we made strike with
our very boat.” Two of them were spared
because they contained native cargo, but the
third belonging to the Portuguese was duly
pillaged. It was not long before the Dutch
intruded their bluff bows into the squabble;
and soon came others. Within a century
the Pacific and its tributary waters had be-
come a whirlpool of war. The white man
made the. seas unsafe for all commerce, in-
cluding his own. He concerned himself with
the family dissensions of every native State.
The Portuguese, in the name of religion,
burnt the Hindu; the Netlierlanders, in the
name of loyalty to a Dutch company, im-
paled the Javanese; the Dutch ousted the
English factors from Bantam, the English
drove the Dutch from Malacca, whence the
latter had previously expelled the Portu-
guese. French and English intrigued
against each other in Siam, and in Japan
the Dutch assisted the Japanese to mas-
sacre and drive out their commercial rivals
of other European nations.
It would be a weariness of the flesh to
trace the farther course of this triangular
contest down to modern times. In the late
war Chinese coolies dug trenches for the
Allies in France, just as the engineers of
Louis XIV. assisted the Turks at the siege
of Vienna, and every one of those coolies
who returned became an able propagandist
of European disunity in Asiatic villages.
Xot content with that, the Allies brought
the war still further home to Asia by forc-
ing the Chinese Government six months
after the. Armistice to expel all Germans
resident in China. Doctors and mission-
aries, their wives and children, were col-
lected by Chinese soldiers, put in troop
trains and brought to the coast, to be trans-
ported in Allied vessels to their own coun-
try. Allied business in China thus obtained
a brief respite from German competition
while the Chinese enjoyed the spectacle of
Europeans being conducted through their
streets under the surveillance of Chinese
bayonets. I have the German reply to that
piece of futile vindictiveness before me as I
V nte - It is a letter from the representa-
tive of a number of German manufacturers
to a leading Chinese general. He asks the
general to place orders with him for the
latest type of aeroplanes, offers the services
of expert flyers to teach the Chinese the
gentle art of bomb-dropping and skilled engi-
neers to build factories so that the general
can make his own lethal weapons on the
spot; for,” he concludes with unconscious
humor, we Germans are filled with the de-
sire to sell our Chinese friends only the best
that we can produce and the kind of good*
the Chinese want themselves.”
Australia arrived on the scene of this
ancient and unedifying brawl late enough
to be able to prove an alibi; but her posi-
tion as the most isolated outpost of Europe,
holding to a white ideal, gives her a vital
interest in its outcome. The principles in-
volved have been hitherto as clear as the
aims and ethics of an ordinary dog-fight,
but lately something more definite has begun
to emerge from the dust and uproar. The
Asiatic team is beginning to show signs of
cohesion. The European group still remains
torn by the passions of commercial rivalry,
but recent happenings at Geneva indicate
that it too feels the necessity for unity m
the face of a common danger. Australia s
interest lies in the modification of the old
piratical methods of dealing with the East
and in the promotion of a sense of unity
amongst the Western nations. Otherwise
her fate may be the usual fate of outposts.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Defeat of Clumsy Macdonald.
Great Britain’s Clumsy Macdonald Min-
istry was defeated on a direct motion of
censure by 364 votes to 19S, and is rushing
to the country. The charge was one of
perverting the course of justice. A frisky
Labor organ, the Workers’ Weekly, urged
the British defence forces to desert or drop
their arms in the face of the enemy, and
desert their country and do other unplea-
sant things. In this propaganda it
openly avowed its association with the
Red rowdies of Russia. When the
prosecution against it was dropped the
ungrateful publication took the world into
its confidence, and explained that the ex-
tremists of the party, guided by instructions
from Moscow, had ordered that there should
be no prosecution, and the Ministry had
saved itself by timely flight. The Prime
Minister first deposited the blame on the
head of his Attorney-General, Patrick
Hastings, who had failed to inform or con-
sult the Cabinet. Later he remembered
that the Cabinet had been consulted, and
that he personally had recommended the
maintenance of a torpid attitude towards
the offender, not because he wasn’t guilty,
but because it was bad policy to advertise
a humble and obscure sedition-monger. The
prosecution of an obscure homicide such as
Patrick Mahon, of Eastbourne, might have
been discountenanced on similar grounds.
Yet if the Ministry had not gone down on
this issue it would almost certainly have
been impaled on the other horn of its self-
made Soviet dilemma. This was the pro-
posal that Britain, out of its depleted re-
sources, should guarantee, and, of course,
ultimately pay, principal and interest of a
big loan to the bankrupt and militant bully
who declares that non-payment of his debts
is a sacred duty, and who alleges that capi-
talists —the class to whom he is appealing
for aid —are noxious folk, and should be
painfully exterminated. Apart from such
active drawbacks, the Macdonalds had the
passive disadvantage that, like the royal
House of Stuart, they “led nowhere.” They
succeeded a Government which had a clearly-
defined idea for dealing with the trade de-
pression and unemployment problem—the
idea which has been employed to put other
nations on their feet, and which Britain
employed with success in other post-war
slumps of its own. The men who procured
its rejection had no substitute. They pro-
posed a levy on capital, but stealing Brown’s
money, however successfully, and giving it
to Jones, wouldn’t alter the fact that the
market for British goods had fallen off dis-
astrously. Besides, Macdonald practically
abandoned the levy as unworkable before he
was quite in office, and promised to appoint
a committee of financiers to produce an
equally remunerative substitute. The com-
mittee, being unworkable likewise, never hap-
pened. Big road-repairing and house-build-
ing schemes were planned, but neither offered
any relief to the ironworkers, textile-work-
ers and shipbuilders, whose condition was
and is the worst. Doles on a gigantic scale
may have helped, and may also have demoral-
ised the recipients, but they left the fac-
tories closed. The urgent need to “find
foreign markets” was stressed: but foreign
markets are busy swapping concessions and
reciprocity treaties among themselves, and
see no advantage in giving preference to a
community which, by reason of its “open
door,” has no preference to give in return.
The problem is really one of recovering the
British market, rather than of capturing
foreign ones. Following the historical ex-
ample of Rehoboam, who undertook, with
disastrous results, to be a greater fool than
the man who went before him. the Mac-
donald Government even abolished the
scrap of preference which its people for-
merly gave to Australia in return for over-
whelming trade advantages. If, as the re-
sult of the whirlwind election which is to
be held, the party comes back for a further
spell of office, it will possibly be driven to
get a definite steering direction of some
sort. So far it has merely drifted, the drift,
to make matters worse, being punctuated
now and again by such incidents as that
over which it eventually came to grief.

The Dingy Homes of Sydney.
When the local daily is short of a sensation,
and the local political and social philan-
thropist is short of a subject to philanthrope,
about, the slum backyards of Sydney are a
reliable standby. It appears that they grow
more slummy day by day, and the habitual
picture now presents the typical yard as a
few feet square, encumbered with the wash-
ing of many inmates, and abutting on the
shack in which the many inmates lead what
is a discolorable imitation of existence. “Two,
three, and four families,” said the Tele-
graph recently, “numbering from a dozen to
18 members, are to be found in one dingy
house,” and it also quoted an instance in
which £1 per week was paid for this home:
One room and a kitchen, without a bathroom, and
with a laundry which has no getaway for the dirty
water.
It is the sort of thing which moves Dr.
Arthur, M.L.A., to bitterness, and arouses
the churches to lamentation, land drives
Smith’s Weekly to expensive comments on
landlords. Yet the backyard is in a fair
way to become smaller, or to be turned into
a doss-house and obliterated, and the four
families of 18 members tend to become five
of 22 members. Things are bound to happen
in a big State where no new town or city is
being built to hold the new people, and
where it is impossible to interest the most
lugubrious well-wisher or the weepingest
parson in even one railway project to make
a new seaport possible, so that babies and
new arrivals won’t all converge on the old
one. In the last two years Sydney added
10,300 new workers and their families to its
factory population, while the country dis-
tricts lost 3000 out of the few they previously
had. This breathless and premeditated pro-
cess of depopulating the country so that
the city may boast that it grows faster than
any other in the empire creates new slum
conditions faster than anything short of
dynamite could shift the old ones. If some
person, however coarse and selfish, could pro-
cure a railway which, being worked with
honest intent, would give a port like Twofold
Bay a fair start, he would probably do more
for the slums of Sydney than a dozen pale
and apostolic-looking theorists who lack the
pioneering spirit and hang on at the old
congested address.

Immorality and Disease.
Dear Bulletin, —“C. McL.” rather misses
the point (B. IS/9/’24) in regard to the
relation between immorality and the spread
of venereal disease. In urging the necessity
for making general a knowledge of prophy-
laxis against V.D., he questions whether such
knowledge might lead to an increase of im-
morality, adding (maybe ironically) :
“Surely our young people are quite suffi-
ciently strong and moral to resist temptation,
otherwise two thousand years of Christian-
ity does not seem to have done very much
good in the world.” Where the removal of
a fear of consequences results in an increase
of sexual indulgence, the cause operating in
previously preventing such indulgence was
neither morality nor Christian teaching. It
was fear, and the person indulging because fear
is removed is neither more nor less moral
than he was while he refrained because he
was frightened. That kind of “morality” is
a mean and negative virtue. Our Health
authorities rely upon killing the specific germ
rather than upon prayer in preventing the
spread of typhoid. Is it not quite as reason-
able, and quite as righteous, to depend upon
killing the specific germ—rather than upon
morality or fear —in preventing the spread
of venereal disease? For one thing, moral-
ity, Christian teaching, and even reason
sometimes show a distressing tendency to
crumple up unaccountably in the face of a
sufficiently strong temptation; whereas the
chemical action of a germicide is unaffected
by piety or wit, by the tears of angels or the
laughter of devils, or even by denunciations
from the unco’ guid. Neither can the acti-
vity of disease germs be stayed by repent-
ance, prayer and fasting, nor by anything
but the destruction of the germs themselves.
One reason why a moral appeal alone will
always fail to stamp out V.D. is that a very
large proportion of cases are “innocent” in-
fections; e.fif., many women living strictly
moral lives are infected by their husbands;
and babies yet unborn are infected by one
or another parent. A moral appeal is wasted
upon those who already are without sin. That
it is wasted also upon most of the sinners
is shown by Sir Frederick Mott, who has
spent practically the whole of his working
life in demonstrating the pathology of brain
diseases. He states definitely that it is quite
as true that venereal disease causes immoral-
ity as it is that immorality spreads venereal
disease, and that almost all the vicious and
immoral people in the world are vicious and
immoral because they have been born with
brains damaged by hereditary disease—usu-
ally hereditary venereal disease. Persons
whose brains are damaged are likely to be
far less capable of appreciating an abstract
thing like morality than of understanding
a simple concrete fact like the application of
calomel ointment, of which “C. McL.” speaks
as being an almost certain protection to men.
Another prophylactic, perhaps even better,
is chinosol, and a London firm is putting up
a useful little effervescing tablet in which
chinosol is the active principle, and which
provides a perfectly safe prophylactic against
either syphilis or gonorrhoea for both men
and women. As protecting but one sex will
take a long time to wipe out V.D., it is to
be hoped that some enterprising chemist in
Australia will import a stock of these tab-
lets without delay. Every V.D. clinic should
provide that the medical attendants, in addi-
tion to treating the patients (and curing
only some of them, as many do not complete
treatment), should give competent instruc-
tion in self-disinfection to both men and
women, as a means of either preventing a
recurrence of disease or transferring it to
others. Not in order, as the wowsers fear,
that the sinner may go on sinning with im-
punity, but in order that the good may be
good with safety, and the clean remain clean
without fear of corruption. Prophylaxis
against V.D., if thoroughly understood and
generally practised all over the world, would
stamp out V.D. in two generations. Think
of it! Then when there were no more people
in the world whose brains had been damaged
by it, it would be worth while preaching
morality for virtue’s own sake. Surely even
the most rabid upholder of the doctrine of
original sin could not object to that?—Yours,
Q. E.D.

* Threatened Boom in State Sweep-
Promoting.
Australia is already so abundantly sup-
plied with racecourses, betting-shops, tipping
competitions, sweeps, two-up schools and
other devices for separating the multitude
from its money that there is nothing to be
thankful for in the news that the Westra-
lian Collier Government has decided to
conduct lotteries “in aid of hospitals and
charitable institutions.” Neither has the
Westralian Labor party anything to be
proud of, inasmuch as it will be taking
money from the masses, whom it professes
to love, for the multiplication of capitalists,
whose destruction it has vowed. Rather a
queer way to go about freeing the worker
from “the shackles of wage-slavery” and
leading him into that co-operative common
wealth where no crude materialism will
reign. One of Collier's excuses for resort-
ing to sweeps is that a lot of Westralian
lucre travels to Tattersall’s in Tasmania,
and the Queensland Government’s Golden
Casket, and very little comes back. The
S. Aus. Gabor Government will have a simi-
lar excuse for rushing into the business when
the Westralian sweeps get going—it has
already been urged to join in the pursuit of
revenue that looks so easy. Then the Labor
Premier across the eastern border will almost
certainly object to the drift of so much
Victorian money to the Treasuries in four
sweep-promoting States; and if Victoria
becomes a competitor N. S. Wales will
assuredly follow suit when Labor returns to
office: indeed, the next N. S. Wales Labor
Government will very likely run sweeps
whether Victoria is in the game or not.
Life will be thrilling for some people when
there is a monthly Government gamble in
each of the six States, and an expensively-
administered gamble at that. The Tatter-
sail people, from whom the Speck Govern-
ment was recently hoping to get another
£llO,OOO p.a. in revenue—that was the
amount derived by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment from the 12$ p.c. tax on Tatt.’s
prizes, which it is abandoning as a conces-
sion to the State —never take the public
into their confidence, but illuminating par-
ticulars of the Golden Caskets appear in
the Queensland Auditor-General’s report.
Last year (1923-24) £589,406 was sub-
scribed by speculators in the Caskets (there
were 22, or nearly one a fortnight) and
only £308,000, or 52.25 p.c., was returned in
prize-money. Federal taxes and expenses
absorbed £119,444, or 20.26 p.c., and the
expenses presumably included the salaries
of two clerks -who have since been
gaoled for working a series of swindles
on the Casket committee. The amounts
handed to the Home Secretary “for the
benefit of hospitals” totalled £102,022.
Those who drew no prizes (and that means
the great majority) would have been better
off had the £162,022 been raised by a small
stamp-tax or by a corresponding reduction
in the prodigious expenditure on the Gov-
ernment railways, which in nine years of
Labor administration have amassed a deficit
of £11,400,000. In effect, £589,400 was
taken from the many, who might otherwise
have spent it fruitfully, and £308,000 dis-
tributed among the few. The Government
“gained” £162,022 by this process, but there
is no telling what it lost by setting a bad
example to the unthrifty, by encouraging a
swarm of private lottery-promoters to arise
and flood Australia with their books of
tickets (a chronic grievance in other States)
—in short, by giving its blessing to the
gambling spirit, which has assumed such
brazen forms in Queensland that when funds
were being raised for the fitting celebration
of Brisbane’s centenary the roulette-wheels
and Yankee sweat tables made their appear-
ance in the streets. In view of Tasmania’s
relations with the Treasury it will be difficult
for the Commonwealth Government to re-
main inactive when six State Governments
are in the lottery market. When that comes
about, as in all probability it will, there may
be a Ministry enterprising enough to issue
one of the renewal loans on the premium-
bond principle, devoting the profits to the
war sinking fund. If the sporty citizen
with a bit of spare cash could buy a pre-
mium bond for £5 —a bond combining the
security of an investment with the excite-
ment of a speculation, since the holder would
be entitled to a chance in periodical draw-
ings of lumped interest, as well as to a small
rate paid regularly until his bond was re-
deemed—sweep tickets would lose their
attractions, and so would bookmakers’
tickets in many cases. The gambling spirit
cannot be killed, but it is the business of
Governments to make the best of it, whereas
they are making the worst of it in Aus-
tralia. Labor will never “emancipate the
masses” by converting them into punters.

The Deadhead’s Paradise.
A cheering budget for the citizen who has
been preparing his income-tax paper:—
Another increase of the Parliamentary salary
( £lOOO p.a.) is discussed in the Federal lobbies,
Canberra being the excuse. It is thought that
Parliament may some day move to Canberra.
The Federal Parliamentary refreshment-room was
run at a loss of £l2Ol in 1923-24, and no charge
was made in the accounts for rent, light or fuel.
“Sundry debtors” owed £ll6.
The loss on the Queensland Parliamentary refresh
ment-room for the same period was £1794. “Sundry
debtors” owed £llB. “The issue to ex-Ministers of
gold railway passes for life over all Australian
lines cost £1352” —an exhilarating extract from
the Queensland Auditor-General’s report. The
same official records that one Minister drew £872 it)
travelling expenses additional to his salary ( £491
was for hotels and sundries and £212 for car
hire), another £B7O, a third £719 and a fourth—
who was only a part-timer, as it were — £ 531. These
sums and others (£5159 was the total) were exclu-
sive of the cost of sending the Premier and his
Mines Minister to London— £2956 in the first case
and £1442 in the other.
Aiikins, a Nationalist M.L.A., complained in the
N.S.W. Assembly that a request for dictaphones,
“signed by more than 60 members of this chamber, ’
had been refused on the score of expense. Premier
Fuller replied that he would see what could be done.
Cheap meals, cheap drinks, railway passes,
cars ad lib., “hotels and sundries,” overseas
trips, dictaphones and renewed talk of more
salary! And the ingenious political mind-
ingenious in this one respect —is constantly
devising additions to the list. _ There are
“Parliamentary visits of inspection” in spe-
cial trains and boats, with all expenses paid.
There are Commonwealth and State steamers
for members bent on wangling gratis sea-
trips. In order to popularise Canberra a
neighboring station homestead was fitted up
for the accommodation of Commonwealth
members, and each was given a hearty invi-
tation to stay there for a week or two. And
if he desired female company he was wel-
come to bring a lady relative, and the public
would foot the bill. _ There are postage-
stamp allowances, special income-tax exemp-
tions, and fees for members of Royal Com-
missions and Public Works Committees; and
if anyone gets in the way of one ot the
fleet of automobiles used for joy-rides and
. shopping excursions, the damages and costs
are charged up to Unforeseen Expenditure.
Truly is Australia the Eden of the deadhead.


The Speck’s Political Outlook.
Tasmanian Treasurer Lyons’s first Budget
shows a deficit £90,000 less than the £300.000
of last year, and an estimated surplus
of a modest £23,000 for 1924-25 —the first
since 1915. Ex-Treasurer Lee, who now
sits ruminatively watchful below the gang-
way in Opposition, voices the view that
Lyons’s estimated surplus will remain
merely an estimate. To which Lyons
blandly retorts that a Treasurer who has
achieved nothing better than a succession of
deficits during nine long years of office would
very naturally regard any sort of surplus as
a non-existent quantity, like Mrs. ’Arris.
The advent of the Budget was the signal
for proceedings which the newspapers hoped,
and still hope, might precipitate a crisis.
But Opposition-leader Newton, at a caucus
meeting of his nominal followers, failed
to persuade them to unanimously back
him in an attempt to dislodge the
Labor Government. He thereupon re-
signed, and llobbs, of the Cocky party,
more or less reluctantly permitted the job
to be wished on to him. Whether Hobbs
will have better luck than his predecessor in
promoting Nat.-cwm-C.P. solidarity remains
to be seen. His chances certainly look bet-
ter, for the simple reason that —thanks
largely to the Lyons Government’s business-
like economies and its comprehensive pre-
sentation of Tasmania’s case for Federal
help—the finances of the State are no longer
so tangled as to make Ministerial office seem
like a Track of Terror and a Slough of
Despond. Thus Hobbs can offer his fol-
lowers an incentive to solidarity which his
more _ forceful predecessor lacked. Against
the view that it is the Opposition’s bounden
duty, as good anti-Laborites, to hurl Lyons
from office at the first opportunity, there is
the . restraining doubt as to whether the Ad-
ministrator would readily commission the
inany-fnilured Nats, to form a Government
when Parliament has only a few months of
life. to run. And the possible alternative of
an immediate dissolution is not precisely what
astute Oppositionists desire: the longer the
elections can be postponed the better the
chance of the electors displaying a kindly
forgetfulness of the more glaring defects of
the various Nat. Administrations. So, all
things considered, it seems not unlikely that
the Lyons minority will be permitted to hold
office until the close of the present session,
at least. But the hold of a Government-on-
sufferance is necessarily, and rightly, pre-
carious, and there is no telling what may
happen towards the end of the proceedings,
when both sides of the House will be fight-
ing for the privilege of facing the electors
with Ministerial prestige.

Balkan Immigrants.
“Machete” : The Sydney press has been
complacently chronicling an influx of Jugo-
slavs and other south-eastern Europeans into
the Commonwealth. In Newcastle, whither
these people seem to be heading in consider-
able numbers, the incursion is viewed with
decided uneasiness. For some months regu-
lar shipments of these men—Serbs, Croats
and Bulgars for the most part—have been
arriving in this country, America, once their
goal, being now fenced off. Though they
manage to pay their passage money, most of
them arrive broke, and as few are able to
speak or understand English, or any lan-
guage except their own, their plight is not
an enviable one. Those who land in Sydney
make direct for Newcastle, their great idea
being to get jobs as laborers (there seem to
be no skilled workers among them) at the
steelworks and kindred industries. Some
have been taken on. but many more have
been found to be unemployable, their ignor-
ance of the language being not only a handi-
cap to themselves but a source of danger
to others. To the unions—in this case the
A.W.U.- —the strangers are a doubtful acqui-
sition, because of their ignorance of Austra-
lian industrial conditions; apart from this
there are plenty of local men idle in the
northern town. This has not prevented the
A.W.U. from helping the destitute visitors,
and relief rations and other aid have been
obtained, as well as some sort of housing.
These men are the type of low-class immi-
grant which the United States has gone to
such pains to shut out —mere bone and
brawn, which, in the days of unrestricted
immigration, flooded the American industrial
organisations with cheap man-power. What
has been proved no good to Uncle Sam is
certainly not much use to a British com-
munity of Australia’s class and type; and the
Federal Government might well pass a hint
to the department responsible for the admin-
istration of the Aliens’ Restriction Act and
cut off this trickle of unemployable labor
before it develops into a steady stream.

Job Control of Ships.
Dear Bulletin.- —There is an aspect of the
case of the Fordsdale seamen about which I
would like a legal opinion, provided it is a
good opinion and doesn’t cost too much. The
difficulty began with the very beginning of
that clumsily named and absurdly expensive
ship (it was apparently built as a relief
work), when union officials made the cus-
tomary demand that they, and they alone,
should supply the crew. This form of job
control, or attempted job control, is so regu-
lar and undisguised as to have become a mat-
ter of course. Brisk quarrels have taken place
over it. and ships have been laid up for long
periods, at great loss, because the owners
refused to give way and be job-controlled.
Yet this is what clauses 29 and 30 of the
Navigation Act say on the subject:—
29. No person, other than a superintendent, a sea-
men’s inspector, or the owner, master, mate or
engineer of a ship, shall engage or supply a seaman
or apprentice to be entered on board the ship.
No person shall employ, for the purpose of engaging
or supplying a seaman or apprentice to be entered
on board a ship, any person, other than a superinten-
dent, a seamen’s inspector, or the owner, master,
mate, or engineer of the ship.
Penalty: Fifty pounds or three months’ imprison-
ment.
30. A seamen’s inspector may be appointed for
any port.
The seamen’s inspector for a port shall — 1
Keep a register of persons desiring to be entered as
seamen or apprentices at the port, and
Supply seamen and apprentices to be entered on
board ships at the port.
That seems fairly specific as to where the
sole right to select a crew lies, and who it
is that legally controls this branch of the
business. The enforcement of the law, par-
ticularly in the matter of the £5O or three
months, should clear up a disputed point.
When the Fordsdale was about to start on its
second voyage the crew was ordered by its
union bosses to leave, so that a new crew
would be wanted, and so that certain per-
sons who were neither ‘-‘superintendent, sea-
MOHAMMEDAN, TOO. PERHAPS.
“The Shafiee prays with his hands on his heart, the Hanis prays with his hands across his stomach,
the Maliki prays with his hands across his breast; and there is said to be a Municipal sect in Australia
which prays with one hand extended, palm upwards, behind its back.”
men’s inspector, owner, master, mate or en-
gineer” might insist on their claim to “supply”
the same “to be entered on board the ship.”
This they expected to do. so negligible is
the law, without either £5O or three months.
(Some remarks are made in clause 103 about
a £2O penalty for anybody who shall “per-
suade a seaman or apprentice to commit
any breach of his agreement,” but I don’t
suppose it means anything.) As the old
crew hesitated about facilitating the pro-
posed breakage of clause 29, the union bosses
took the simple course of turning them into
those accursed and hardly human creatures
described as “scabs,” and did it just as cal-
lously as an old magician would turn his
political opponent into a cat and then set
dogs after him for being a cat, and just as
offhandedly as a mediaeval inquisitor might
push his victim out of the church and then
fry him outside for not being inside. The
three stages of development, I suppose, were
(1) preference to unionists, which made the
outsider a very minor and inferior person
(2) monopoly of work by unionists, which
makes the outsider no persbn at all; (3) in-
creasing development of the power to prevent
any person being a unionist —in other words,
to sentence him and his family to starvation
by striking him off the list of employable
human beings—and to do this without any
legal appeal or redress whatever. The atti-
tude of the State and the Commonwealth
appears to be that if some union bosses,
possibly elected by the usual doubtful de-
vices, or a majority at a meeting, possibly
packed, decides to impose a ferocious sen-
tence on an Australian citizen, it doesn’t
matter whether his offence was failure to
assist at the breakage of clause 29 of the
Navigation Act or clause 6 of the Decalogue.
Even if the victimised person is so accus-
tomed to this kind of rule that he doesn't
see anything particularly wrong about it,
just as the Carolina nigger of a century ago
saw nothing particularly wrong but a good
deal that was unpleasant about slavery, the
situation is one which makes our alleged
free system of government look darned ridi-
culous. But the poor old system is probably
accustomed to that. —Yours, etc., Solomon
Malaprop.
«
From J. P. Jones, Minister of Health in
Victoria:—
Ajyropos The Bulletin’s “Plain English” on
“The Talking Cure for Disease”—the disease in
this case being V.D.—if the writer will read my
utterance he will know that the tenor of my speech
was, taking public sentiment as it is, it is difficult
to know what to do. I said a great body of people
(who dominate public thought on this question) are
against the use of prophylactics; it, therefore, be-
comes a question of education. Since the V.D. Act
was passed in 1917, 41,167 cases have been treated,
22,000 of them by the State at a cost of £86,000.
As a great many become reinfected, it seems a hope-
less job. If The Bulletin would use its influence
to induce that section of the people now opposed to
allow the open sale of, and advice to people to use,
prophylactics to prevent infection, it would do move
useful work than snarling at me. The present position is
that any man or woman who gets a dose can go up
to the clinic, get cured, and pick up another the
week after. What’s your suggestion to deal with this?
Let’s have it; it must be one of practical application.
Great minds in other parts have tried to find a
solution, and failed, with many of whom I have
discussed this problem. I think it is admitted
that I have done more for the disease-stricken in
two months than any other Minister for years past.
The Bulletin thought that it had made it-
self pretty clear on this point, if on no other.
Still, for the benefit of Vic.’s Minister for
Health, it doesn’t mind repeating that it
wants (1) compulsory notification; (2)
registration and frequent inspection of the
ancient profession, with segregation in every
case of infection; (3) proof in cases of
V.D. that remedial measures are being
taken; (4) segregation where those measures
arc not taken. And even this is a modified
programme—and only tentatively modified —
to meet the objections of the Joneses that
money is scarce: if it wei’e as plentiful as
it ought to be, the programme would be: (1)
Notification; (2) segregation.
The habitual crowd collected on the eve of
Sydney’s recent Eight-hour Day to banquet
and expound (1) that the Eight-hour prin-
ciple is the corner-stone of liberty and the
key of the democratic arch, and (2) that
Eight Hours was re-imposed on the toiling
masses by a brutal Government just ■when
they had soared into the purer atmosphere
of Seven Hours and a few minutes, and the
golden pinnacle of Six Hours or less loomed
ahead. In fact, the prevailing view was that
happiness lies in the nearest! possible
approach to the status of the confirmed
dosser who labors not at all. But there
was a lack of the one-time jubilation about
the concrete successes achieved by the policy.
Queensland has just owned up to the fact
that its railways have had the usual annual
deficit, the amount this time being £1,593,066.
The miscellaneous enterprises of the same
State showed a loss of £85,691. The Govern-
ment was lately driven to appoint a Royal
Commission to inquire into the Brisbane
water and sewerage business —a job which
was originally to cost £1.600,000, and is now to
cost £6,000,000, and which makes so little pro-
gress that it may cost anything. The tenor
of the report is that the work done is poor;
that the supervision has been unmention-
able ; that the go-slow has been wonderful,
amounting in cases to a whole day’s card-
playing and no work at all; and that the
thieving has been something to write an epic
about. The State’s revenue, its savings bank
deposits per inhabitant, and the number of
employees in its factories were all less than
in 1921, and the railway shortage easily
beat all other railway shortages put together.
So when the Langs and Gardineks hold tin;
place up as a bright and shining example of
what can be done by nine years of Red
Administration, they do well to avoid any
excess of detail. A despondent balance-sheet
from Westralia’s terrace of mixed State
enterprises, and the news that the Common-
wealth shipping line is going to the bad at
the rate of £1,600,000 per annum, didn’t help
to make it a cheerful feast for Socialism-in-
our-time. There were too many skeletons
present for comfort.
♦
Granted that most of the drama that Holly-
wood pours over this long-suffering country
is bilge, and that if bilge must be produced
it might as well be produced in Australia,
there still remains a real danger that the
need for supervision will be used to impose
a censorship on every expression of senti-
ment or opinion that differs from the
Killjoys’ own. Among subjects recently
suggested as meet for excision were the repre-
sentation of a long-dead English king eating
meat in a manner no longer tolerated in
polite society; references other than adula-
tory to the royal family; Charlie Chapli.x
“bringing contempt on religion” by dressing
up as a Protestant minister; and the depict-
ing of human foibles. If a censorship such
as is proposed had been operating in Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, English literature would
be the poorer by one of its most glorious
heritages. Shakspeare’s Histories and
Milton’s “Paradise Lost” could have been
suppressed and Dante’s Inferno denied
admission; for none of these works
shows much reverence for the narrowly con-
ventional in patriotism, religion or morality.
Censorship of the proposed scope would not
only operate on the imported garbage; it
would sit heavily on the development of the
nascent Australian industry, which would
tend to become insipid, and would doubtless
expire in the end from sheer inanity.
4
In the earlier years, when the Labor party
fought without aspirates and with very-
little pretence of grammar for a hearing
among the workers, there were very few
loaves and fishes attached to the business.
No man rose to wealth or to any special
distinction from the ranks for many
years, and Joseph Cook probably stands
alone in having gained some personal advan-
tage by an early retreat. With the rather
sudden successes of the party, about 1910
and later, the outlook of members of the
political leagues changed. To get a Labor
selection and win a Labor seat became the
aim of a thousand men with great per-
sonal ambitions; and an examination of
Labor propaganda will show that the wilder
proposals which have alienated most sym-
pathy have come from such men. But
these men are not the real movement, tin-
burden of which is carried by plain people
who are least in the limelight—people who
can be relied on to prevent the suicide
which often seems so near. This explains
why the opponents of Labor are continually
deceived as to the position in the other camp.
The leaders of the party are not and never
have been a united band ; but there is suffi-
cient unity in the rank and file to make tin-
party far less dependent on leadership than
its opponents are. So the movement will
not be killed by a few swindling ballot-
boxes, or the defection of this man or tin-
perversion of that. The real test is a matter
of fundamental policy. Not many years
ago Labor stood for a stronger Australian-
ism and a broader grasp of continental ques-
tions than the other parties. It is quite
possible for it to return to that position.
Nearly all the tempting by-paths which it
cannot safely tread have been explored and
rejected ; there remains a broad Australian
thoroughfare which Labor once entered and
which none of its opponents has yet dis-
covered.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The economies of Australian politicians
are as bewildering as their extravagances.
They make no bones about throwing away
millions on Government steamers, cattle-
runs, shacks, pools, go-slow jobs and so
forth, but now and then, when a really
important question looms up, they get into
a perfect passion for saving tuppence.
Hence the grotesque fact that, while all
the other associated nations have been dis-
missing the Disarmament Protocol with a
full knowledge of what it contains, the text
has not yet reached Australia. Cabling
would have cost a few pounds, so the docu-
ment will arrive by steamer with the next
consignment of Swiss cheese. . Of course,
this hasn’t prevented the Priminister and his
predecessor from criticising it at porten-
tous length. The main question is whether
the protocol will enable a country which
objects to another country’s domestic policy
(on immigration, for instance) to have the
grievance removed by a League tribunal
or. in the alternative, to wage war without
incurring the penalties prescribed for aggres-
sors. Bruce is of opinion that it won’t.
Hughes is positive that it will. The latter
has got in early with a demand that th°
arrangement should be rejected, and, if
there is the slightest ground for supposing
that it will admit of Australia’s immigra-
tion policy being referred to solemn pundits
or chattering doctrinaires at Geneva or else-
where. rejected it will have to be.
The one thing certain about the confused
proceedings at Geneva last month is that
they have rendered the prospect of American
participation in the League of Nations more
remote than ever. The Republic over the
water can never consent to any of its domes-
tic arrangements being reviewed by a foreign
tribunal with power to make representations,
pacific or otherwise, and that is the sinister
possibility which emerges from the Septem-
ber palavers as regards Australia. 1 erhnps
to make its attitude clear, or it may be be-
cause its admirals need a change of air, tlie
IJ.S. Government lias suddenly revived the
project of an overseas cruise. It is an-
nounced that American warships to the num-
ber of 60 or thereabouts will shortly visit
Commonwealth waters.
The new Board of the Commonwealth
Bank got quickly to work. At first it had
not been intended to appoint a chairman
until members knew one another better, but
within a few hours the need of one was felt,
and masterful John Garvan, lately chairman
of the Notes Board, was chosen —largely be-
cause the big job immediately ahead is the
easing. of the situation with regard to foreign
exchange. At present it is costing about £o
p.c. to shift money from London to Aus-
tralia; and, though that in itself is serious,
a worse trouble arose through the inability
of the banks to promptly shift portion ot
the wool-clip money on any terms whatever.
The directors of the Commonwealth Bank
got into touch with all the other banks, and
as the result of conferences it has been de-
cided to pool their resources; and this, it is
believed, will adequately relieve the situation.
If necessary the banks will be assisted with
some additional currency: the latest offer
of £5,000,000 accommodation of that sort
at 7 p.c. is felt by several of the directors
of the Bank to be illiberal, especially in the
mrtter of the interest demanded by the former
Notes Board.
THE WORTHY REPRESENTATIVE.
“The man who claimed a so-called independence of thought was not worthy to represent the workers
in Parliament.” —Melbourne Trades Hall speech.
THE TOILER: “Hi! Aren’t you the bloke who's tryin’ to get inter Parliament ?”
THE POLITICAL ASPIRANT : “Yes, I am, brother .”
THE TOILER: “ Orright—clean my boots!”
Just before the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment whizzed into recess the Prime Min-
ister announced that lie had “arrived at a
basis for an agreement” with Gunn, tlic
S. Aus. Premier, regarding a railway to
the Macdonnell Ranges, which railway, it
seems, is to be constructed “subject to cer-
tain conditions.” The Federal Public
Works Committee reported that, if light
rails and second-hand sleepers were used, a
narrow-gauge line from Oodnadatta to the
Macdonnell Ranges could he laid for
£1,500,000, and it is thought that if tlic
S.A. Parliament is sufficiently humble this
magnificent project will go forward. It
is just on 18 years since the then Common-
wealth Government entered into a bond to
construct, not a 200- or 300-mile section
composed of hairpin rails and termite-eaten
sleepers, but “the transcontinental railway
from Port Darwin to P'ort Augusta.” That
"condition” has been shamelessly dodged.
But it didn’t take the present Government
IS days to commit the Commonwealth to
an expenditure of £2,000,000 on standard-
gauge railways—part in N. S. Wales and
part in Queensland —which were never the
subject of a bond.
From a niche in the Temple of Talk: —
Bruce and Page came through a difficult session in
much better shape than seemed likely a couple of
months ago. Each has his temper well under control
—a great asset for a Cabinet Minister in these muck-
raking days. When the doctor looked to be in dire
trouble with the agriculturists who objected to his
election agreement, the Opposition snipers made
tilings as sultry for him as they could; but the
cheerful grin which lias dona so much to conciliate
testy soil-ticklers was conspicuous during the hottest
fire. Similarly, the Prime Minister never allowed
himself to bo baited into anger by the acerbities of
Scullin or the malevolence of Hughes. Pratten has
lightened their burden since he was added to the
Ministry, but they lost a vigorous debater when
Stewart got out —or was shot out, as he says—
and the others are an ordinary lot. The weakest
link in the Ministerial chain is Pearce. If the
Government doesn’t drop him in good time it will
lose seats in Westralia, where the fluent incompetent
is very unpopular. His own seat is gone already.
The making of political programmes is an
art which few possess. The N. S. ales
Progressives have it not. They have compiled
a policy of 50 items- —two or three tall trees
and the rest moss and weeds; 40 platitudes,
five pious aspirations and some sundries.
One quaint sundry reads “Portable operat-
ing-theatre for use in country districts.”
The mental picture of this apartment scour-
ing the illimitable baekblocks like a hunted
witch or a lost soul gives rise to thought.
Another Progressive idea is that the railway
accounts should be doctored or falsified by
paying the deficits of money-losing lines out
of general revenue. Some people like
being deceived even when they know they
are being deceived, and so aren’t really de-
ceived at all, but others think it hardly
worth while. The business suggests a
hermit wearing a home-made wig to hide his
bald spot from his own conscience.
It is possible to attach too much import-
ance and give too much advertisement to the
blatant but tinpot problem involved in the
N.S.W. Marriage Bill. It is a matter that
requires attention like licensing of estate
agents and the better regulation of pony
courses, but it isn't worth a referendum, or
the tenth part of a referendum. _ The essen-
tial point is merely the declaration that the
State’s marriage certificate is good and suf-
ficient, and that people may not declare that
it isn’t, or incite other people to act on the
assumption that it isn’t.
With the help of an all-night sitting the
Vic. Labor Government bullockcd its Com-
pulsory Wheat Fool Bill through the Asseni-
bly. To get majorities on controversial
clauses it played off one section of the Oppo-
sition against another. Just as Prendcrgast
is proving a much better general as Premier
than he was as Opposition-leader, so Hogan,
Minister for Agriculture, who was in charge
of the measure, revealed qualities which lie
was never thought to possess when he was
merely a destructive critic on the other side
of the House. Oman —heavy, slow-thinking,
even-tempered, roundabout, repetitive was
the stonewaller for the Opposition. The
septuagenarian Premier was in and out of
the House all night. He looked less tired
after 23 hours’ continuous work than many
of the younger members.
The record slum of the Northern Terri-
tory is said to be Government property at
Alice Springs. It is described as a galvan-
ised-iron home for half-caste children. 30
girls in one room and 20 boys in another.
Other features alleged are no bath, no glass
in the windows, an earthen floor, no garden,
only one lavatory, and just as muck white
supervision as the schoolmistress can give
when she isn’t busy on her teaching job.
Owing to the utter unimportance of a mere
Federal Possession with no votes to sell, it
is anticipated that these conditions will re-
main. If any Minister had large political
or other interests along the overland tele-
graph line the transcontinental railway might
be a live question ; but that helpful circum-
stance is lacking.
The anti-defence people who proclaimed
the annihilation of Japan as a naval Power
because two cities had been devastated by
earthquake won’t be interested in the report
witli which the Japanese Home Department
commemorated the anniversary of that event.
The report shows that Tokio has been re-
habilitated to the extent of 70 per cent. In
the districts of Azabu, Akasaka, Koishikawa
and Yotsuya, which were only partially
affected, all the houses have been rebuilt; in
districts where the destruction was more
complete 60 to 80 per cent, have been
restored. In five years’ time the capital is
expected to look more prosperous and fright-
fully modern than ever before. And for the
first time for many years Japan’s foreign
trade has shown an excess of exports over
imports.
Dr. ,T. Elliott, a Sydney chemist who has
lately returned from three months’ perspira-
tion in Java, has a new recipe for populating
our tropical North with dinkum white men.
One white man being sufficient to take care
of several thousand jumbucks, the pastoral
industry has done little to solve the problem,
so Elliott proposes to import flocks of coolies
instead who, he says, require one white over-
seer to every ]f> colored men. The intro-
duction of a million workers in soiled loin-
cloths would thus automatically increase the
white population by 100.000. The chemi-
cal tourist’s figures are doubtful, however.
The brown population of the countries he has
iust been visiting is as hard to measure as
the length of a snake disappearing into a
hollow log, because it increases every day;
but it is not less than 50 millions. The
white and whitey-grey population is 170.000.
This gives about 294 natives to every white
or greyey-whitc. A flock or herd of one mil-
lion coolies browsing in our front-garden
would thus require the ministrations of
only 3401 white shenherds. This small gain
in white population hardly seems worth the
risk of having such a multitude of brown
brother wandering around in a state of dis-
satisfaction and semi-nudity.
From the Vic. State Gallery:—
It looks as if Vic.’s House of Landlords will
make a corpse of the Labor Government’s Com-
pulsory Wheat Pool Bill. The six Laborites and
five Cockies will vote for the measure, but there
are 22 Nationalists, and it is unlikely that seven
of these will detach themselves. Leaving out Frank
Clarke, who will be in the chair, seven of the
eight country Liberals who will have to face their
constituents next year have nothing to dread by
voting against the bill, as their districts are not
wheat areas; and the city Nationalists can slay it
without any qualms. Still, any number of the
leisurely old gents, may feel too tired to turn up on
division-night, and strangulation may be prevented.
The Laborites, anyhow, still have hopes.
“Wart” : If the Lyons Government lias its
wav the Speck will have an Arbitration
Court instead of wages boards, and the story
goes that Marshall, M.11.A. for Bass —-one
of the Nationalists who are keeping Labor
in office—has been picked for the presidency.
But it is exceedingly doubtful whether the
Leg. Council will let the Government have
its way.
FAITH v. CHARITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Following on the free distribution of milk in
some of the schools and kindergartens in the poorer
quarters of Sydney, depots have been opined by -he
Royal Society for the Welfare of Mothers and Babies
and the Junior Red Cross in Surry Hills and Woolloo-
mooloo, where the tiniest mites from the slum dis-
tricts are brought by their mothers and elder si fetus
for a daily drink. ‘Please, lady, is this where the
milk is?’ is the query of many a new-comer to tin
voluntary helpers.”
I hear an echo, a voice that runs from a bygone
age and Galilee:
“The things ye did for My little ones, the least and
feeblest, were done for Me.”
There are warring churches and squabbling sects,
where once but a single one sufficed,
And each for its own the Word dissects till dogmas
smother the creed of Christ.
If He came again would He long remain where in
church or chapel the godly kneel?
Does His spirit live where the priests forgive repentant
sinners or anthems peal?
Is it found where the funeral service hums or the
sponsors stand by the christening font,
Or right in the heart of the seething slums where the
only passport for help is—want ?
There is hot debate in the halls of State, with angry
outbursts from wagging jaws,
And mouths frame insults and lips drip hate distilled
from rubrics and canon laws. ,
This faith or that is assailed, men yelp. Pardie, 1
would find my faith instead
Where the poorest mother may look for help, the
tiniest, puniest babe be fed.
No thought or heed of church or creed —for sign or
token of sect no care—
The wail of the weak, the hungry’s need, are the
only pass-in tickets there.
There are wistful looks as the cracked mug fills with
milk —and with lovingkindness, too.
Peaked faces brighten at Surry Hills and the sun
shines fairer at Woolloomooloo.
There are eyes, I think, must at times grow wet,
though never a church-made prayer be said.
There are tottering feet to be firmer set on the path
of life that the babes must tread;
More fragile limbs would sturdier grow, the grimy
alleys ami lanes amid,
If Christians all cared lcssl to know what the Bible
means than the Master did.
1 lift my hat to women like these, and the sex
that leaves sectarian fights
To those who fashion the law’s decrees, while it
pours the milk for the famished mites.
Faith? What is faith with <liarity . priced—for the
good it serves or the place it fills—
When there’s work to hand, the work of Christ, m
Woolloomooloo and in Surry Hills?

“Feng-Shui”: No scientific statement of
recent times has cheered me so much
as Dr. Elliot Smith’s declaration that man is
descended through the apes from tarsius.
GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
“Kitty had a quiet little wedding, I suppose?”
“Of course. You did not think they would quarrel in
front of the parson, did you?”
Prof. Wood-Jones, of Adelaide, to whom
Smith has lent a body of the little beast
for further investigation, is inclined to go
further and rule the apes out altogether. I
was never particularly fond of the ape as
an ancestor myself, his habits and disposi-
tion remind one too much of a party politi-
cian ; but tarsius is an animal one can take
to one’s bosom, like a guinea-pig. He is a
round, furry little chap with enormous eyes
and long fingers and toes with blobs on them.
When startled he skips like a flea, but most
times he drifts about the upper strata of the
forest with an expression on his round face
of philosophic doubt which appeals to one
these days. The Dutch call him spook-
dierbje, or little ghost animal, while my
friend Norsa, of _ Labuan, in Borneo, has
some curious stories about him which seem
to show that the natives long ago observed
that he was no ordinary denizen of the
jungle. He is believed to be immortal and
to have control over the weather. His
bristles ground down and given in banana
paste to babies prevent them crying at night.
The Malays when felling a tree lay one of
his bones along the ground in the direction
they want the tree to fall. One of his ver-
tebrae thrown into a house will plunge all
the inmates into a deep sleep and enable a
thief to operate with impunity. He has
the unusual ability of turning his head right
round and looking at you over his backbone,
and this has induced the natives to credit
him with being Janus-faced. More converts
to the theory of evolution may be expected
as soon as he becomes better known.

“A.M.J.”: In a recent paragraph on the
sportsmanlike German aviator Felmy, it was
mentioned that, after capturing Australian
airman Claude Vautin, lie flew over the
A.I.F. Palestine camp, dropping letters and
photos to indicate the safety of the captive.
A romantic interest attaches to one photo
he dropped of his prisoner. It was picked
up by an Aussie and sent to a little lady
in W.A. who had never met Vautin. Some
five years later the long arm of coincidence
brought them together in Sydney, and they
decided on a life partnership. Vautin and
Felmy exchanged engraved wrist-watches, and
now when Vautin, jun., crows and flaps his
wings at the sound of daddy’s “tic-toc,” his
mother feels a mournful conviction that he
has inherited daddy’s taste for flying.

“Otara”: A pioneer of the Bellinger River,
on the North Coast of N. S. Wales, was
Thomas Wood, who began to gpifge a home
out of the bush in the early ’forties. The
second white child born on the river, was
Alfred Benson, who, when he came to man’s
estate, found a bride in the Wood household.
As there was no clergyman nearer than the
Macleay, the young folk had to go to Ivemp-
sey for the splicing. Times were hard and
horses scarce and roads were dreams of the
future, so young Alf and his bride took their
honeymoon in the form of a walkabout. They
tramped the whole 70 miles back to the Bel-
linger, subsisting principally on fish and
oysters, seasoned and dressed with love and
kisses. This idyll of the scented brush
track and the silver river reach is recalled
by the . recent death in Sydney, in her 77th
year, of the plucky bride of half a century
ago.

“Cwrw Bach”: “Centurion’s” mention of
the Anzac who used the double-barrelled 12-
bore at Gallipoli, and got
a tip from higher up that
it “wasn’t cricket” (B.
25/9/’24), recalls that the
Yanks had a shotgun issued
specially for trench fighting.
It was fitted to take a bay-
onet, and was of the single-
barrelled, pump-action,
magazine type, holding six
cartridges. Each of these
contained nine shot the size
of large ball-bearings. Yan-
kee officers commonly used
this type of 12-bore (unoffi-
cially) on the Moros in the
Philippine Islands to stop
their rush to close quarters
with the bolo-knife.

“S enoj o” : - The local
branch of the A.L.P. in
Fitzroy had evolved a well-
nigh perfect organisation in
support of a star candidate
who was to sweep the muni-
cipal poll. The ward had
been canvassed once, and a
second door-knocking cam-
paign was in progress; ela-
borate election-day voters’
“graphs” were in prepara-
tion, and a fleet of
cars was to convey electors
to the booths. Public meet-
ings had begun, and all sorts
of speakers—Cabinet Minis-
ters down to mere “com-
rades” —were bellowing eulo-
gies at the street corners. It
looked all over bar shouting.
And then a trifling defect
was discovered. The candi-
date had forgotten to lodge his nomination.
* * * *
“Ex-Dig.;”: In Melbourne Professor J.
Adams and the Rev. J. E. James have been
deploring sundry fights between American,
English and Australian sailors in various
ports, and deducing therefrom that “the feel-
ing between the peoples of the different
English-speaking nations is not what it
should be.” These aloof gentlemen fail to
realise that such periodical clashes between
men in uniform have little or nothing to
do with national feelings—it is almost
always a matter of girl. When a garrison
moved out of an English town it often went
amid a hostile demonstration from the male
population, a final expression of resentment
towards the uniforms that had attracted
the ladies. Encounters between the old garri-
son artillery, whose members used to take
off their belts for use in the combat, and
naval men were once a common occurrence
in Sydney; and during the war the Dig-
gers in camp at Weymouth were refused
town leave whilst British, and, subsequently,
American, sailors were at Portland. On one
QUITE A NICE LADY.
“Snobbish, isn’t she?”
“Oh, I don't know. She’s awfully sweet to me every time
I’m introduced to her.”
occasion when leave was not stopped there
was something like a general engagement, and
many on both sides were “done up properly.”
The British Jack Tars, whose women lived
thereabouts, had some cause for wanting to
“beat up” the invaders when they got home.
When I urged upon one big Digger that the
Britishers’ annoyance was reasonable, he ex-
ploded: “What blanky right have they to
come back until the war is over?”
“A.M.J.”: A dis-
cussion of queer
accidents had led us
on to surgical opera-
tions by amateurs.
Someone recalled
the case (well
known in W.A.) of
the plucky post-
master who, with a
penknife and some
medical instructions
over a long-distance
telephone, operated
successfully on a
desperate case of
appendicitis. An-
other had seen a
mine carpenter am-
putate a man’s leg
with a saw. The
old man expressed
the deepest admira-
tion for the nerve of
the operators. “I’m
blessed if I could do
it,” he said. “The
best I’ve ever done
•was a simple one.”
Pressed, he revealed
that his elementary
effort consisted in
slitting the windpipe
of a choking man
and inserting a pipe-
stem till medical aid
arrived.
“0.P.H.” : Here is the Long Arm hard at
work again. Richmond (Vic.) is to get its
long-sought-for technical school, a contract
haying been let for a building on a reserve
adjoining the industrial suburb’s town hall.
Years ago, when the agitation for the school
was brisk, and promises were not materialis-
ing, a member asked a Minister if he could
say approximately when a tender would be
accepted. “Let us say on the day Melbourne
Gaol is turned into a school,” replied the
Minister jocularly. And, curiously enough,
the contract was let on the day a tender was
accepted for converting the chapel of the
vacated city gaol into an art museum for
technical college exhibits.
* * * *
From a police-court reporter:—
The Law’s heedlessness of the
general effect of penalties has occa-
sionally a humorous side. Recently
a man who could earn £2 a week
and his keep on a farm was be-
fore the Police Court for not
complying with an order for the
payment of 10s. a week for the
support of an illegitimate child.
He was also in arrears on another
order for £2 a week to support
his wife and her children. He was
sent to gaol for a month on the
first order, during which time the
accumulation of arrears under
that ceased; but meantime £8
had been added to his arrears on
the larger order, and before long
he will probably be called on lor
not keeping abreast of this. Unless
the Court makes an exception of
him he will go to gaol for a
month or two on that, while
arrears mount up on the first
order ; and so ad infinitum. The
only effect it has on the man is
that, instead of paying £1 15s.
or so on a liability of £2 10s. a
week, he pays nothing most of the
time, and whenever he leaves
prison he has to spend an unpaid
period looking for work. When
he was sentenced, the magistrate
commented on the impossible posi-
tion, but that did not stop him
from doing his “duty.” There is
another instance of a consumptive
against whom his wife and children
obtained an order in his absence
for £3 a week. He is also an
unskilled worker, who cannot
possibly earn £3 a week besides
his board. So about once in three
months he turns up at the. court
and as regularly is penalised. The
time before last a compassionate
magistrate, to encourage him to
find the money, imposed a fine. It
is said there is, or was, another
woman in his case; but ordering
him to do the impossible is no
way to incline him towards sup-
porting his legal spouse. Blindfold
Justice, however, continues to
brandish her sword unperturbed.
“Henry Pannikin” : One of the most awe-
inspiring bits of ironmongery that did ser-
vice in the war was the German “rum-jar,”
a fearsome projectile which made our “plum-
puddings” look like crackers. We got a full
share of them at the Bluff, Ypres salient, in
’l6. At night they were easily seen en route
owing to their somersaulting movement and
the shower of sparks which escaped at every
turn. As they were slow on the journey,
there was generally time to dive for shelter,
JUST HIM AND HER AND IT.
“How wonderful it is to see the sun sink down to rest upon
the sea!"
“Yes, isn’t it? A fellow could sit here and watch it all night.”
but the difficulty was to judge just where
they would lob. I remember one morning
when we saw one start from the Hun trench.
“This way!” said the sergeant. “No chance!
It’s going that way,” yelled the sergeant-
major. I was one that dived along the
breastwork with the latter. There was an
ear-splitting explosion; when I recovered
sufficiently to look in front of me, I saw the
sergeant-major simply in atoms, with a dead
private alongside him and the air full of dug-
out roofs and particles of the Belgian front.

Red Page (2J I'J/’24).
It’s drifted into print at last,
The tropic that was broached
When first, down ways before untrod,
Cain’s wife from out the Land of Nod
His mother, Eve, approached;
The question raised that distant day
Reached Beersheba and Dan,
And spread and spread—it’s spreading still,
It never stopped, and never will!
They’ll thrash the matter out until
’Tis answered; What is man ?
By no means what he ought to be—
Such seems to be the grain
The matron harvests sad and late;
But hopeful flappers try the great
Experiment again,
Each in her optimism sure
She has the proper plan;
The others bungled things, but she
Has grasped the long desired key
That solves into felicity ...
The riddle; What is man?
Poor girls ! Their indiscretion rash
Evokes disdainful smiles
Of pity for such judgment raw
From seasoned aunts and mas-in-law
Who know the villain’s wiles ;
They are the ones to answer that,
The ones who really can
(Knowing the creature through and through)
Inform all those of dimmer view—
Aye, and Professor Thomson, too—
Exactly what is man.

“Sixenate” : Unusual suddenness marked a
recent Melbourne maintenance case, the
parties having known one another only two
days wlieu they decided to ask the blessing
of a Church on their union. They
parted just as swiftly—the day after
the wedding, in fact—the ’groom smash-
ing some furniture in his ma-iu-law’s
house before leaving, presumably be-
cause he had not yet any furniture of his
own to break. But matrimony has been
rushed at even shorter notice than this, and
disillusionment come as quickly. The record-
breaking case within my memory occurred
when the couple met only 24 hours before
the wedding, and the bride applied for main-
tenance two days after it. It is doubtful
whether any other woman had previously
summoned for non-support a husband who
was totally unknown to her a week before.
“Tabac”: We have installed a crystal set,
and have just had the pleasure of inviting
George Fuller to listen-in to the Dickens
Universal Broadcasting Co. This is what
he heard:—
Poor little Bill was dead. In Black Rod’s care
he lay at rest. They said it was no marvel, too. Yes,
he was dead. Poor little Bill, so beautiful, so
calm. Fresh from the hand of Fuller and waiting
for the breath of life, yet had no chance to live,
so suffered death. Boyce dressed his couch, and
with some pansies, full of thought, he laid him
out. “And when I die,” said Bill, “oh put from

“It looks like rain. Shall I put my coat around you?”
“Thanks, but don't trouble to take it off.”
me the Knightly form of Hughes, nor let the shadow
of the two who knifed me in their House across me
fall,” Those were his words. Yes, he was dead.
Poor little Bill, so innocent, so sweet, so undefiled
by subtle thought. Yet shall he rise again, saith
Fuller, and, Peden-like in all his parts, defy the
grave.
We couldn’t get hold of Lang that night,
but we put him on to Carlyle Broadcasting,
Ltd., the next evening -

“Mephisto”: A Bulletin writer the other
day mentioned the Chinese dislike of the
Caucasian’s smell. Every human b6dv pos-
sesses an aura. The naked eye cannot detect
it, but it can be seen by looking at the nude
body in a darkened room through a screeu
of dicyan in, a coal-tar dye. It then becomes
a greyish mist of a shape concentric to the
body. One theory is that the aura is the odor-
ous envelope surrounding the human body.
Undoubtedly there is also a well-defined in-
dividuality in auras; they vary, for instance,
wuth health, a sick person having a wider
aura than usual. The subject is interesting
doctors and scientists: but anyone washing
to experiment should know that continued
exposure of the eyes to light filtering through
dicyamn is harmful.

“Tick-tack" : The Abrams cure is not the
only Yankee knavery which has led to tra-
rredy in Maoriland. A few
years ago chiropractic began to
boom in the Shaky Isles, and a
man and his wife, who had not
been very successful at ordi-
nary methods .of making a liv-
ing, took a trip to the U.S.A.
to acquire this Midas touch
which turns human vertebra*
into pure gold. Less than IS
months at the wonderful Palmer
Institute was sufficient to
teach them all there was to
learn, and they returned to set
up in practice in a provincial
M.L. town. Their first patient
was their own son, who in their
absence had developed tuber-
cular symptoms in the very
portion of his anatomy on which
chiropractors concentrate their
efforts. His death, which occur-
red shortly afterwards, damped
bis parents’ enthusiasm for
their new profession.

“Huflin Gufliu”: Enter this
for the Strange-ways-of-meet-
ing-a-wife competition (B.
2/10/’24). Years ago a small
boy while fishing fell into the
river that runs by a Vic. coun-
try township. A little girl, see-
ing his plight, ran anjil held the
fishing-rod for him to grasp,
pulled him to the edge, and
helped him to scraonble out.
Twelve years followied without
a second meeting between the
pair; then the girl, now grown
up, went on a visit to her mar-
ried sister in the city. She
got a job there, and went to “business”
daily by the same tram. Its conductor was
the boy she had saved. They were married
three months ago.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Old residents of Fiji held a
meeting in Sydney the other day to discuss
the celebration of the 50th anniversary of
the annexation of the group b(y Britain. In-
cidentally, the chairman, W. Kopsen, told a
story which should settle a long-standing
Fijian controversy and remove a fiercely-
resented aspersion on the intelligence of as
bright a band of cannibals as ever consumed
long pig. 11l 1569 a Methodist missionary,
W. Baker, visited the upper reaches of the
Rewa River, and was embraced and devoured
by the inhabitants. Envious of this bit of
good luck, the natives in the more settled
districts lower down set going a yarn that
the Upper Rewa people were so ignorant
that they had eaten the missionary’s boots,
imagining them to be part of the game.
Though this was hotly denied by the diners
concerned, it has remained to this day a re-
proach against the men of the once-cannibal
tribe. Now, after nearly 60 years, Mr.
Kopsen says that when he visited the cannibal
village as a labor-recruiter, very soon after
the feast, he saw the missionary’s skull and
boots hanging side by side in the village club-
house. The men who ate Baker may now
sleep in peace, and their descendants fear to
look no man in the face.

“F.A.” : Apropos of queer casualties, dur-
ing our sojourn in Belgium in August, 19] 7.
the First Divvy were bivouacked near Cate
Beige. The artillery was
camped near the outskirts of
Dickiebusch, and after a
few days of rain the “bab-
bling brooks” decided to shift
the cookhouse, the same con-
sisting of a couple of light
rails, upon which the dixies
were planted above the fire.
A new possie was found, and
all hands had gathered about
the warmth, when there was
a crashing roar, a geyser of
smoke and mud and ashes,
and about 50 gunners and
drivers were stretched about
the landscape, where they
had been knocked by the con-
cussion of the mysterious ex-
plosion. There were 20
hospital cases, and as many
more took a few days’ light
duty to get over their hurts.
Apparently a bomb had been
dropped into a shell-hole,
where it had failed to com-
plete its job at the time, and
had been covered over. The
fire did the rest. As a ren-
dezvous cooks’ fires ceased to
be popular in the Divvy for
a while.
“Dingbat”: An inspector of schools hears
some quaint theories. One 13-year-old, asked
to describe the process of digestion, assured
me that “the food is moistened by the salvia,
then it is borne to the back of the plateau
and passed into the gully.” Another put
it this way: “When the foods we eat are
churned over in the heart, they go to a
micrisope of tiny tubs which are called the
gastric juices.” Anatomical restrictions were
despised by a third : “The food we eat goes
in the mouth, windpipe to the lungs, lungs
to heart, and from the heart to the stomach.”
One pupil (a girl) referred to the influence
of alcohol on the digestive process: “Our
food goes from our mouth down a tub lead-
ing to our lungs, but alcohol goes up into
our heads and affects our brains.”

“Scalpel”: Touching the handicap on the
firstborn of a family (B. 2/10/’24). Obser-
vation has shown that in lunatic asylums
eldest sons and daughters, especially the
former, are conspicuously numerous; also
most medical practitioners arc familiar with
the family in which the first boy is physically
a weakling and the others robust. Another
feature pointed out and commented, upon by
both Kraft-Ebing and Irwan Bloch is that of
sexual perversion. Kraft-Ebing estimated
that 60 per cent, of the sexually abnormal
persons who had passed through his hands
were eldest sons, either individuals whose
normal sexual feelings were inverted or
those possessed of overmastering sexual pas-
sions which led them into such crimes as
rape, lie advances theories to account for
these things—mostly they depend .on pre-
natal influences—and under .an improved
penological system these considerations may
some day be taken into account.

“Harold Hardupp”: Somebody howled dis-
mally at a meeting of the A.N.A. the other
night that the present immigration restric-
tions in Australia would keep out a poten-
tial Isaac Newton, if he happened, like Isaac,
to be a dwarf and a weakling. Thereupon
an embarrassed and somewhat guilty silence
fell on the gathering—until someone boldly
remarked that a refusal in such a case
would be dashed well right: Australia is
asking for farm immigrants, and Newton
would probably make the poorest sort of
farmer. I knew a hotel proprietor who ad-
vertised for a cook and received amongst the
applicants a man who quoted poetry and was
indignant at being rejected. “I don't be-
lieve you’d engage Shakspeare if he asked for
the job!” said the angry one. “Wouldn’t
mind,” Bung answered brutally, “if you’d
guarantee that my boarders would take a son-
net for breakfast and a hunk or two of
blank verse for lunch.”

“Stellsby”: The shades of Deeming, Ned
Kelly and other victims of the rope now roam
a new beat. The mortuary of the demolished
Melbourne Gaol has been shifted, holus-
bolus, to the. new civilian wing of the Caul-
field Military Hospital.

“Nikko”: In the thermal district of Roto-
rua (M.L.) there are apprehensions of an-
other eruption, disquieting to those who
remember the great Tarawera outburst of
ISSG. Although that upheaval lasted only
four hours, the damage was enormous, and
the surrounding districts are more closely
settled now. The ominous sign that pre-
ceded the great eruption—the rise of the hot
lake, Rotomahana—is once more in evidence.
Waimangu, the great geyser—it was once the
most dynamic on record with its 160 ft.
shots—is also showing signs of activity after
nearly 20 years’ comparative quiescence.
Still that may mean nothing. At various
times the giant has heaved his shoulders:
not long ago he wrecked the Government
accommodation house and fatally scalded the
caretaker's wife and child. Smaller erup-
tions are not infrequent, and usually occur

THE BALLAD OF THE GREY HAIRS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A oung Ethel found some threads of grey
In Daddy’s amber crest,
And tenderly she straight away
Her sympathy expressed.
It made her softly stroke- his brow
111 thought of all his care
for her, and tenderly to vow
Fresh trials his soul to spare.
A oung Ethel is a thoughtless elf.
Whose cash demands were classed
By Dad, who has to find the pelf,
Insatiate in the past.
But now some Knowledge of the cares
That must have wrung his brow
Has chastened her. She’ll be, she swears,
A better daughter now.
Meanwhile the old ’un merely winks
And orders out his* car.
(Again ’tis irksome toil, she thinks,
That takes him forth afar.)
Yet still he finds the life-dance gay
By an enchantress led
Who hasn’t yet discerned the grey
Amongst his crop of red.
Youth is indeed a time of gold
When joy unsullied gleams;
But “age” is never quite as old
As youth in folly dreams.

ihe last of the shares which they and Brown
and Robinson held were bough* by the Vic.
Chamber of Manufactures. The operation
was part of a fascinating little bit of finance.
When the Vic. Legislature passed the Work-
men’s Compensation law just on 10 years
ago, the State's manufacturers, being very
much better organised than those of N. S.
Wales, decided to see if they couldn’t get
cost price insurance in the new line. As
the other fellow naturally always wants to
make some profit out of anything he does
for you in the way of business, they decided
that their only plan was to do' the business
themselves: hence they formed this co. But,
seeing that their Chamber had been the
intermediary in the matter, they agreed to
give that body a sort of option over their
shares; more, they agreed to vote the
Chamber ’an annual amount out of the
profits sufficient in time to provide the pur-
chase price. The enterprise was so success-
ful, and the annual votes have been so liberal,
that, as mentioned just now, the last lot of
shares held by individuals were acquired
during the year. The business, therefore,
now belongs wholly to the Chamber, which,
so long as the manufacturers stick to it,
will he in a position to maintain very low-
priced insurance, and do good things for
Australian industry with whatever surpluses
there are. Already the amount paid to the
Chamber, apart from dividend, totals £40,464.
The body has acquired a splendid home in
the business portion of the Southern capital,
which, with an adjoining property, pur-
chased last year, represents a frontage of
138 ft. to Flinders-street. A new building is
contemplated. Further, the Chamber is pay-
ing £l5OO p.a. to the University “for the
purpose of assisting education and research
in those sciences which have a bearing upon
manufacture and production.” As the
Chamber’s purse gets heavier from the insur-
ance business it intends to broaden this
policy.
Whether the business will grow depends
mainly upon the individual manufacturers:
and whether it will be conducted at the
present very cheap rate depends upon them
too. What that rate has been this table
shows:—

Business couldn’t be done at an average of.
say, 12 p.e. if it had to be chased. Nor
would it have been possible to offer such
concessions as these :
On Workers Compensation premiums (20 p.e.
if a discount of 10 p.e. has been granted) 30 p.e.
On marine premiums (in addition to 15 p.e.
discount) :
Inter-State .. . . . . .. 20 p.e.
Overseas .. . . . . . . 10 p.e.
Motor-car and cycle premiums (compre-
hensive and Third Party) . . .. . . 10 p.e.
On public risk, plate glass, fidelity guarantee,
personal accident and sickness and boiler
explosion premiums . . . . . . 20 p.e.
It seems incredible that people with insur-
ances to place will let a concern which has
done such things for them fall away, now
that they are no longer personally and
directly interested in it as proprietors; but
even manufacturers do queer things some-
times. In addition to workers’ com-
sation. the co. issues fire, motor-ear and other
policies. Its motor-ear policy has been
rather r.islied forward of late-: and that
partly accounts for the high loss rate. But
with low premium rates, loss rates are
bound to look high. For instance, add 20
per cent, to last year’s premiums, and you
get £145,061 as the total. That higher in-
come would not of course affect the total of
losses ; so the loss rate would then amount to
only a fraction over 43 p.e. instead of the
nearly 53 p.e. shown above. Assets are
sound and very profitable. They are earn-
ing just about 10 p.e. on the capital.

Further improvement was shown last year
in profits and ordinary dividends; but whe-
ther the year’s actual business was more pro-
fitable than the previous year’s cannot be
said. Stocks have been written down during
each of the past three or four years; and
this operation is, of course, reflected in the
disclosed profits—whether they are large or
small depends upon whether the writing-
down has been great or little. The directors
were apparently satisfied with the current
business; at any rate, they declared divi-
dends which called for more than the dis-
closed profit—that is, the current profit.
less the amount appropriated to write down
old stocks. They were, no doubt, encour-
aged in this course by getting a windfall
during the year, in the shape of a refund
of taxes; including that with the profits, a
substantial sum was left to add to reserves.
Following the usual custom of showing re-
serves less intangible assets, the last column
in the introductory table is headed “Nominal
reserves.” Goodwill still stands in the
accounts at £lBO,OOO, and there are certain
“rights” besides. The total amount, what-
ever it is, ought steadily to be written down ;
for there is always the possibility that an-
other Dr. Dunlop will arise who will do
for modern traction what that inventor did
when he dug the pneumatic tyre out of his
remarkable brain. Capital has expanded in
the following manner:—

Up to 1919 profits were not grasped greedily
by shareholders, and quite a lot was left
in the accounts; the bonus issues were, there-
fore, merely profit handed over at irregular
periods instead of annually. In 1920. however,
the directors were too optimistic: they wrote
up hook values- —rarely a wise thing to do —
and handed on £170.000 of gift shares. That
operation was one factor in subsequently
depressing the ordinary dividend as low as
44 p.e. Original shareholders, of course,
could stand a few of these knocks, because
their holding now is five shares for every £8
put up in cash.

Though stocks have been written down (and
there was more than a suggestion in the
chairman’s speech at the annual meeting that
an axe rather than a penknife was used), they
have begun to move up again. Australia’s
biggest rubber co. realises that it must be
well-equipped for a continuous battle against
big overseas interests. One interesting little
phase of this contest arises from the Ameri-
can manufacturers’ decision that agents must
take cars fully shod with American tyres.
There is a substantial duty on tyres, of
course, but this move means that the Aus-
tralian buyer who wants only a very cheap car
can’t get it without purchasing also a not-
very-eheap set of tyres. To meet this “slim"
move, the Commonwealth Government thus
far has apparently given Australian tyre-
makers no help. In this and other ways
£1,840,000 still goes out of Australia yearly
in payment for rubber goods. Dunlops and
the others have therefore still a large field
to win. The excess of liquid and semi-
liquid assets over liabilities is smaller, but
at £754,074 is still so great as to warrant a
feeling of comfort among pref. shareholders.
The continuance of their 10 p.e. div. seems
a matter offering no difficulty. Thai ordin-
aries may climb to the same level is possible.
Last year’s disclosed profits, as already ob-
served, did not suffice to pay the ordinaries
7 p.e. after the prefs. had been paid; but
the real profits may have been larger—
probably were larger.
The co. is not neglecting the future. Fol-
lowing its usual custom it sent three of its
chief men abroad during the term to study
manufacturing conditions in Old World
countries and in America. Its system of
employees’ shares continues successful, 75 p.e
of the workers participating. Holdings under
£3OO obtain 5 p.e. p.a. in addition to the
declared div.; the fourth hundred 4 p.e. in
addition, and the fifth hundred (maximum)
3 p.e. additional.

What is the matter here? Certainly there
was too much haste in capitalising reserves,
just as there had been too much haste in
pushing up the dividend; but these were
minor troubles compared with the crash in
the rubber market at a time when the co.
was heavily stocked. The following com-
parison shows, among other things, what was
in the co.’s stores at June, 1921; and as,
judging by the great shrinkage in profits,
there was some writing-down in that year,
probably stocks had been still heavier before
the 1921 balance: —
1921. 1922. 1923. 1924.

So the co. held nearly half a million's worth
of goods, raw and manufactured, as at June
1921 ; and rubber was just then falling head-
long. The Pt. Swettenham Co. had averaged
Is. ll*d. for its 1919-20 output, for that of
1920-21 it got only 10jd. Had the Barnet
Glass Co. built up large reserves, visible or
internal, it might have pulled through with-
out any great parade of its misfortunes.
Unfortunately, like a lot of other people, it
became alarmed at the rumor that one or
more Governments proposed to tax cos. on a
sliding scale —the higher the div. rate, the
higher the rate of tax —and in 1914 it began
capitalising its reserves in order to water
down the rate of dividend. The immediate
results were so pleasant that it repeated the
operation on a much larger scale in 1918.
The latter operation left it actually with
less than no reserves whatever, if goodwill
is excluded from the list of assets. The
crash in rubber came before it had time to
build up reserves again ; so that it was left with
no option but first to reduce divs. and. when
that was found to be quite inadequate, to
write off capital—the capital that was repre-
sented only by the froth of the rubber boom.
In all £06.250 had been capitalised; and
£89,736 was blown off. The directors no doubt
hoped they had then done enough : the past
year’s results showed they hadn’t. Whether
they have done enough now. this paper
doesn’t know. Maybe the directors don’t
know either. The trouble isn’t always
solely with the stock on a merchant’s shelves;
stuff contracted for in a high market has a
bad habit of dropping in long after the
market has crashed. There is never any
difficulty about getting delivery under those
circumstances. ■
This, however, is the point of perhaps
most importance for the investor: there must
be a bottom somewhere. Those old stocks
can’t last for ever. The table above shows
they have been reduced from £490,843 to
£162,784; and there surely must be in the
latter amount a good deal of stuff that has
been bought at the low post-slump prices.
The realisation has not only got rid of very
dear stuff, but it has eased the co. of a lot
of debt —liabilities are over £200,000 less
than they were three years ago, which means
that the co. is from £lO,OOO to £14,000 a year
to the good. And meanwhile plant, etc.,
appears to have been enlarged or improved.
Not only is the financial position thus greatly
bettered, bill business seems to have been
well maintained. Book debts —which are
some sort of a guide to that —are very little
less than they were in 1921 ; and it takes a
10l more sales to represent £lOO,OOO, which
is about the present figure, than it did three
or four years ago. No notice can of course
be taken of the profit figures of the last two
or three years. They have been governed,
not by the business done in the term to
which they apply, but by the miscalcula-
tions made years ago. On the other hand
it would be unsafe for the investor to fix a
hungry eye upon the old 15 p.e. divs.. for
they were merely part of the miscalcula-
tions.

This co. was formed in 1920 to acquire Syd-
ney Paper Mills, Ltd., and the Australian
Paper Mills Co.. Ltd., of Melbourne. Ac-
counts of the Sydney co. are not available,
but the Melbourne co., in the last year before
merging, made a profit of £38,960 on a capi-
tal of £236,356. and paid a 12| p.e. div.
For the past three years the amalgamated
co. has paid only 8 p.e., and even that,
according to the accounts, has not been
quite earned. Yet it seems hardly possible
that a Board comprising as many hard-
heads as there are on this co.’s directorate
would, year after year, pay away more than
had been earned, especially as, on the sur-
face. there are practically no reserves. The
explanation may lie in the item: ‘’Balance
from manufacturing and trading account for
the year.” There is no telling what pro-
vision has been made therein for doubtful
debts, depreciation of stock, etc. In addi-
tion, a vote is made annually for general
depreciation ; and this reserve, now £28,000,
is not included with the reserves shown in
the table. It may be true profit, or it may
not; probably it is not. At any rate, the
plant and machinery at Melbourne, Sydney
and elsewhere stands in the books at cost,
£544,952; and the £28,000 seems to be the
only provision for depreciation and obso-
lescence. Even “furniture and fittings.
£3744.” is taken in at cost.** This doesn’t
look as though the directors have much, if
anything, up their sleeve.
There have been no very great movements

Bank overdrafts comprise £143,427 of the
liabilities; the balance consists of trade ac-
counts and a few deposits. Liquid assets,
including book debts, but excluding stock,
amount to a little over £lOO.OOO. Of the
remaining £1,000.000-odd. property and plant
in Victoria, N. 8. Wales and Adelaide
account for £755.579 —all in “at cost”
except that a few small leaseholds
are written down. Stock on hand, “ai:
valuation,” amounts to £221,834. If the
“valuation” is cost or below cost that fact
should have been made known. The stock
—very largely, no doubt, what is known as
kraft paper—-is a substantial weight to
carry. The directors consider the prospects
encouraging, notwithstanding that at the
annual meeting in Melbourne the acting-
chairman complained of lack of support from
Australian manufacturers, and of the insuf-
ficiency of the tariff protection in some
lines. To add to those difficulties, as he
pointed out, the present position in exchange
represents an advantage of £3 p.e. to the
importer. But, whether the prospects are
regarded as encouraging or not. the co. ought
to strengthen its position. Probably recent
changes in factory arrangements may help:
the machinery from Geelong was lately
shifted and re-erected at Broadford. An
increase in production is reported, but the
effect does not show in the period covered by
the accounts. Certainly, so far as one can

judge, the dividend has only been main-
tained during the past three years on the
prospect of something turning up; and it is
about time it did. Nominal capital lias

Westralian State Prospecting Board broad-
casts the fact that since its creation five years
ago it has assisted over 600 parties, com-
prising upwards of 1000 men, and equipped
five State prospecting parties, at a total cost
of about £30,000. The Board’s operations
have extended from Wyndham to the Bight,
but most attention has been paid to the
Eastern and Murchison goldfields. The State
prospecting parties discovered nothing of
value, and the only gold find made by assisted
prospectors which the Board thinks likely
to be of any permanent benefit to the State
is that recently reported from Mt. Grey by
Ivan Jones and party.

Wilson, Assistant State Mining-Engineer
(W.A.), reckons, after a discussion on figures
with the manager, that Mararoa’s latest
acquisition, the Emu North, has 15,000 tons
of oxidised ore in sight, from which a profit of
£1 per ton ought easily to be obtained. But,
although the bottom level is in payable ore,
the lode’s value at greater depth is some-
thing on which he doesn’t care to hazard an
opinion. Beyond having a “fair tonnage” of
oxidised ore in the old workings, the Emu
block, which is also included in the deal, is
thought little of, according to Wilson, by
Hie Mararoa management.

In 1910 an old Westralian prospector, Alf
Weston, discovered gold about 150 miles east
of Perth, in a locality where some experts
ridiculed the possibility of its existence. A
few months later several claim-holders were
busy breaking out good crushings, and the
place became known as Westonia. Since
then over 300.0000 z. have been won; and,
although the glories of the Edna May group
have departed, and little is left of what was
once a fair-sized mining-camp, the few re-
maining battlers still have faith in the field
and prophesy that it will come again. Wes-
ton, the discoverer, after seeing the rise and
fall of the field, went on the land and was
accidentally killed the other day.

Hampton Properties, Ltd. (W.A.), recently
commissioned Vail, of the Lake View and
Star, to inspect its Mt. Martin mine, Hamp-
ton Plains. On receipt of Vail's report the
Board will decide whether to bore or sink.
A fair quantity of gold has been won from
the Mt. Martin to date, but the yield has not
been sufficient to make ends meet. Still,
that has been the failing of nearly every mine
sci far worked on “the plains.”

Daisy Queen (AV.A.) backs its appeal to
shareholders to pay calls by glowing refer-
ences to its new venture, the Vivien Gem,
which is about 10 miles from the watery
grave of the co.'s old mine. The Gem is
officially billed as something really good, but
it is in a locality where nothing short of
battery results can be relied on.

Golden Point’s motto is “Try again.” First
it sorely disappointed shareholders at West-
onia, and afterwards did likewise at Hamp-
ton Plains (W.A.). Then it went to Vic-
toria, hoping to do better. Reports were
glowing enough of that venture, but losses
are still being sustained and reconstruction
talk is again in the air.

Now that the Ivanhoe has been added to
its sources of supply, Lake View and Star
(W.A.) proposes to gradually increase its
monthly tonnage. It is improbable that
future operations at the Ivanhoe will be on
anything like the former scale, but about
one-tliird of the ore required for the amal-
gamated co.’s mill will be drawn from its
reserves, and later on work will be resumed
where the old Ivanhoe Co. left off under-
ground. If the future of the amalgamated
co. proves to be as bright as officially fore-
casted, treatment costs will be the lowest
and percentage of extraction the highest at
Kalgoorlie, while the general economy in
working will be the envy of all other cos.
operating there.

Dr. Wade is as definite in his declara-
tion that there is no oil in North-West and
Northern Australia as he was regarding
the region in the south-west of South Aus-
tralia, where he flew in the face of Dr.
Basedow and Charlton Dod. On his trip
north he called in to check up E. P. Zak-
harow’s generalisations about bitumen and
oil on Elcho Island. Seepages Wade
couldn’t find, nor will he give them room
even to flow. But he spotted iridescent-
iron films on small streams. So he brushes
Elcho Island off the slate, and with it
AYaggon Lagoon, on the Roper, and
some of the Fitzroy area in AV.A. —all wrong
spots inherently, he says, or places too old
geologically to have reservoirs of petroleum
left in the strata. however, gives a
chance to the marginal country on the Fitz-
roy, and to Price’s Creek, where he found
the best evidence of an accumulation of oil.
He thinks that three bores might be put
down to 3000 ft. or 4000 ft. to test the area.

Mararoa is still groping for a mine, a
search that is responsible for a debit at
profit and loss of £17,326. Now it is testing
Reedy’s Find blocks, 32 miles north-east of
Cue, where the co. already has lost a wad
of money. To buy the new leases took
£4OOO, but the money looks to have been
well spent if ore reserves exposed during the
option equal estimates and break to sample.
On the North lease it is claimed that 13,000
tons are developed, worth £32.500, with
2000 tons probable, sampling £4500; and
on the South lease 3000 tons containing
£4500. A battery is on the ground, and as
soon as water is available Mararoa will once
more be on the move. As a side-line the
co. is boring on one of the two position
blocks held at Wiluna, next door to the
Gwalia Consolidated’s big area. With
funds going out freely the old co. has again
got into the call-list.

each. Thirty thousand are offered to the
public at Is. on application and Is. on allot-
ment ; 30,000 paids go to the Exploration
Syndicate as vendors and 5000 to Fred
Tricks for promoting the show. So the paids
and he control everything, while the G.P.
puts up the cash. The present idea is to be
content with the £3OOO of capital to come in
application and allotment moneys. Funds
are to be used to send a good silver-lead
man to skirmish; if his report be satisfac-
tory, there will be a pup float to get in
capital for mining on a big scale. The area
the co. has in hand is 80 miles from the
Gulf of Carpentaria and south of the Mann
River. So far the claim has had a three
weeks’ prospecting by W. F. Murphy and
Tom ,T. Shepherd, who, to do the work, had
to break overland from the Katherine on
a three weeks’ journey. Schists, sandstones,
quartzites and diorites compose the tangled
country. Values were got over a width of
150yds. for a length of half a mile. There
are many gossan outcrops, but the leaders
contented themselves with grabbing two 80-
acre blocks covering the outcrop. If the
prospectors are modest over what they saw
the fluent pen has had liberty in the pros-
pectus. Some phrases are “immense silver
lode,” “no silver-field in Australia shows
more promising indications,” “enormous
quantity of material,” “this requires no sort-
ing” and “every sample has proved on analy-
sis to be of high grade”-—all for £3000!

“Blair Atholite”:
I question Randolph Bedford’s statement that
Styx and Baralaba coal arc superior to Blair Athol.
Blair Athol coal has proved satisfactory on the
Central Queensland railway system, whereas the
Styx-Baralaba mixture causes delays and even com-
plete hold-ups. So bad is it that a petition signed
by practically ail the enginemen on the Central
railway protesting against the use of the mixture
was sent recently to the Commissioner.
* * * *
And from Randolph Bedford:—
“An Old Miner” (“Wild Cat” Oct. 2) writes so
one-sidedly that I suggest the anonymous old gentle-
man is a shareholder in Blair Athol. His argument is
that the State mines shouldn’t have opened, because
their operation is alleged to have pinched “good
unionists at Blair Athol.” The greed of private
collieries forced almost every State in Australia to
open collieries for railway supply. The N.S.W. Western
railway system reduced its coal cost 9s. a ton by
State operation. The comparison of Warra coal with
other State coalmines operating is valueless. Warra
coal is right, but Warra is a watermine. Bowen
State coal has cut coal costs at Townsville from
635. a ton to 31s. a ton. As to Baralaba working
at a loss, the incredulous old gentleman is hereby
informed that, from the second week of May to the
second fortnight of September, Baralaba has male
a profit of £l3OO. That does not notice the
big profit made by the Queensland railway system in
the lowered cost of coal.

In process of registration, the Flagstone
T. M. Co., in 4000 shares paid to £5, to
acquire 20 acres of tin leases 22 miles north
of Emmaville (N.S.W.). L. P. Collins, of
Tent Hill, who has had over 30 years’ dis-
trict experience, and the well-known E. P.
Johnson both declare the possibilities to be
something out of the ordinary in tin reefing.
They describe the lode as carrying about
5 p.c. tin oxide, and agree that it is over
15ft. wide where exposed in an open cut 15ft.
deep. Collins, more in sorrow than in anger,
remarks that the show would be rushed by
mining speculators if only it were out of the
State, “as they do not seem to want any-
thing near home.” It would be more correct
to say that tin lodes are not very popular
wherever they are. Samples of this ore in-
dicate felspar and quartz porphyry, and in
the deepest cut a soft kaolin which can
almost be crushed in the hand. Vendors get
1500 shares and £l3OO cash—and that cash-
hite takes some swallowing.

Malim Nawar South has been registered
at Kuala Lumpur, in the F.M.S., although
the float was an all-Sydney affair, fathered
by the group which controls Rawang and
others. There are 130,000 20s. shares, of
which 58,000 paids go to the vendors and
72,000 contribs. paid to ss. were subscribed.
These already are at a premium of about;
4s. in Pitt-street. The boring was done
by Malcolm Newman, who reports that 520
acres, watered by the Kampar River, con-
tain 35 million yards of pound ground and
15 million of 12oz. ground. A bucket dredge
with a minimum monthly capacity of 150,000
yards will argue the yardage and poundage
question with the area in 18 months’ time.
Newman states that “the difficulty experi-
enced in boring by hand to depths greater
than 70ft. resulted in many of the holes
being abandoned in material yielding several
Pounds of tin per yard.” He also states
that “shareholders may expect handsome
dividends over a long period.” Well, there’s
no harm in expecting them, and in this case
they will probably come. But Rawang’s ex-
perience shows that, even with bores to help
him. the mining-engineer can’t see much
further into tin ground than into any other.

Further rain having fallen on the catch-
ment area of the Crown, Mudgee (N.S.W.),
the 10-head battery is running three shifts
instead of the single shift first announced.
Manager Waters expects a 15dwt. return
for the first month; and chairman “Billy”
Lees is in high glee at the prospect of treat-
ing 800 _ tons in the four weeks. But the
trouble is that there are 125,000 shares, and
800 tons is a miserable output for a register
of that size. At best the Crown looks like
a proposition carrying big tonnages of low
grade, the enrichment about “C” shaft being
shallow. If this is so the co. will have to
handle more stuff at much lower costs.

A couple of years ago South Lucknow
(N.S.AV.) discovered contact veins and
shoots of arsenical pyrites, but payable re-
sults are not yet. Syndicate and company
have been mining for over four years, and
about £15,000 has been spent. The recently-
installed rock-drilling plant is expected to
produce results from the discovered ore-
bodies. Between South Lucknow’s areas and
the old workings boundary exist the leases
of the Lucknow Pups. Facing conditions
which the unlimited funds of the last big
English co. and the intimate Lucknow know-
ledge of Harry Newman failed to unravel,
the Pups co. six months ago scored its first
vein at contact with the joints. Subse-
quent prospecting has not produced expected
results, but 60ft. along the joint south-east a
new vein was struck. Work was concen-
trated on the discovery with good develop-
ments. A lode has been opened up for 12ft.
and Bft. across; total dimensions at latest
were still, unproved. Good ore carrying
coarse-grained arsenical pyrites was struck
recently. The mine completed its fourth
anniversary on Sept. 30. Except current
wages practically nothing is owing, and a
call is not likely till the beginning of next
year. Expenditure by the four S.E. cos.
aggregates £32 000, and with various other
efforts the present revival has cost more than
£40,000.

Broken Hill, despite excellent metal mar-
kets, is not as cheerful as it might be. Only
three inches of rain has fallen in nine
months, and there has been ho decent reser-
voir intake since December, 1923. The offi-
cial declaration is that enough water is in
hand to keep mills going till the end of the
year; after that, failing any additional falls,
the water must be kept for town use.

Though Maoriland’s Prime Minister Mas-
sey declares he has lost his old belief in
Taranaki oilfield, Colin Fraser returns from
New Plymouth and supports the verdict of
geologist Clapp. Marquardt, an American,
is to deal with the geological problems, while
Arthur Moline, lately of Bendigo, will see
to the engineering side. Plant for two drills
is at Auckland, except a few parts which
can be fitted in later when Moline has sorted
out his first shipments. Marquardt’s confir-
mation of the deductions of Clapp is giving
Melbourne speculators heart. Two seepages
are reported by the new man which had
escaped previous notice; they are both along-
side Tarata.

With the worry of Charters Towers (Q.)
mining off his shoulders, Billy Clark has
secured an option over Mt. Coolon, and in-
tends floating a new co. It is reported that
the option extends to the Sydney and Bar-
clay’s Native Bear. If so there should be a
fairly good time ahead for shareholders, pro-
vided the management is right, for the
Coolon lode stands out on its own at pre-
sent in Queensland. It has only been kept
back by divided management and rather
tinpot methods. Big-scale operations seem
to be called for. Large quantities of
medium-grade ore are assured; over a length
of 800 ft. there is probably an average thick-
ness of Bft. of pay ore, and in places it
exceeds 20ft. With low-cost handling the
tonnage should run well into six figures
above the 200 ft. level. Crushings in recent
years have averaged just under an oz. over
the plates. Some of the Sydney crushing*
have run into £9 a ton, including recovery
from the tailings. The Bear lias made .i
small fortune for Dave Barclay, but the
time is none too early when company de-
velopment should supersede private owner-
ship for the welfare of the field. Water sup-
plies may cause a bit of anxiety presently.

Recent development work on Mt. Isa mines
(Q.) continues satisfactory, and William
McRae was impressed with quantities of ore
in sight on his recent trip to the field. Assay
values for silver remain on the low r side, but
improvement is expected near water-level,
owing to the leached appearance generally
of the ore exposed. The main shafts in sev-
eral leases are down to 130ft. in search of
the sulphide zone, but nobody knows at what
depth to expect it. Ernest Bails thinks it
may not come in under 250ft. to 300ft. (Ieu-
logist Dunstan has completed the aerial sur-
vey work, but results have yet to be plotted
up.

The Hon. Edmond Pery, who died in
Sydney the other day, was the second son
of that Earl of Limerick who, prior to suc-
ceeding to the earldom, was Superintendent
of Agriculture at Norfolk Island. Born at
sea—his mother was a niece of Captain
Croker, R.N. —Edmond was baptised on the
deck of 11.M.5. Alfred, and later became a
gunnery officer in the Navy. After quitting
the sea he came to anchor in N. S. Wales
and got the first step to a magistracy in his
appointment as C.P.S. at Lithgow and
Forbes, finally taking his seat on the Bench
at Kempsey. The family claims descent
from Brian Borumba, a chieftain of Brian
Boru, and from EdAvard 111. The Hon.
Edmond was 79 when the banshee wailed.
A first-rate mathematical mind had
Thomas Frederick Furber, who was folloAved
to the grave last Aveek. Born in England,
Australia caught him young. Entering the
N.S.W. Lands Department in 1869, he was
a licensed surveyor in 1875, and when only
26 years of age became a member of the
Licensed Surveyors’ Examination Board. To
him is due the reciprocity between the Sur-
veyors’ Boards of Australia and Maoriland.
A FelloAv of the Royal Astronomical Society,
he lectured for years at Sydney ’Varsity
in geodesy and astronomy, and accompanied
W. ,1. Cornier to Lord Ilowe Island for the
transit of Venus in 1882; and as director
of the Trigonometrical Survey lie controlled
the triangulation of N. S. Wales. He
crowded a busy life into the Psalmist’s span.

The N.S.W. Public Service suffered the
loss of one of its brainiest officers by the
death of E. M. Moors, the actuarial member
of the Superannuation Board. Moors Avas
for many years a lecturer on mathematics
at Sydney Uni., and students will remember
his characteristic impatience of dull brains
that would not make an effort to see what
to him Avas crystal clear. On the other
hand some will gratefully recall the infinite
patience he Avould expend when the effort
was made and the man did something earn-
estly to help himself. Outside his Univer-
sity duties he assisted to found the People’s
Prudential, and so esteemed was his actuarial
ability that in 1911-12 the Government
sought his help in formulating a scheme for
superannuation in the Public Service. The
present system is based upon his recommen-
dations. In 1919 he was appointed to the
present Board and Avas its backbone to the
time of his death. Behind an unobtrusive
personality which avoided all limelight, his
intimate friends kneAV a man eager to help,
charitable in judgment and Avide in culture.
Bananaland lost a good and capable citizen
when Clias. F. Neilsen passed out the other

Europe for his education, returning to study
law and ultimately to practise as a solicitor
in the sugar-town. In 1904 he drifted into
Parliament as representative of a most un-
stable constituency (Musgrave), and landed,
after a feAV years in the Assembly, in the
old Leg. Council. The Woongarra railway
and the Bundaberg foundry stand as monu-
ments to his push and local patriotism.

plete the purchase. The firm took the plant
back, and to this incident the Waikato Co-op.
Dairy Co. owed its existence, with Good-
fellow canvassing the country for supplies
for his first factory. The company grew at
an amazing rate, and in 1010 absorbed the
rival concern whoso name it took. To-day
the co. has 8000 suppliers, 62 factories and
a turnover of about five millions per year,
while its produce goes all over the Avorld,
Buckingham Palace being a regular customer
for butter and cheese. At not much over

William Hague, dead in Adelaide at 60,
was a solid South Aus. type of politician. A
well-educated storekeeper in the Angaston
district, he filled most local offices before
going into Parliament in 1912. There he
became chairman of the Liberal party, and
of the Coalition. In 1920 he took office under
Peake, and continued under Harwell until
the overthrow at the last general election.

“Vanikoro”: "When he is not worrying

•T. H. ProAvse, the Westralian M.H.R.,
dabbles in physics and astronomy, and has
evolved a theory of his own about the sun

the sun is, as is assumed, a huge molten mass-
throwing off heat as a fire does, then the
space between the sun and the earth which
the sun’s rays have to traverse ought to be

inter-planetary space is intensely cold.
Browse holds that the sun’s rays are not
heat rays at all until they are warmed by
friction with the earth’s atmosphere. He
quotes the analogy of meteorites, which are
cold bodies as long as they are passing
through space, but become red-hot or even ,

ever Peacock, Allan, Argyle, Eggleston and the others
with ambitions may think, there is no doubt that
Lawson is the - man who takes the eye on Speaker
Bowser’s left. The House always looks up when he
glides in and slips noiselessly into his seat on the
second Opposition bench.
Bill Slater, Prendergast’s Attorney-
General, who became a lawyer only a year or
two ago, tried to snub Lawson in Vic.
Assembly the other day. The ex-Premier
promptly put William across his knee and
spanked him. Slater, of course, disclaimed
any intention to be uncivil, but Lawson, dis-
regarding him. turned to Premier Prender-
gast and asked him if he would get the in-
formation which the Law Minister hadn’t
furnished. “Yes.” replied the Chief, and he
put at least a pint of oil into the monosyl-
lable. The soft answer that turneth away
Avrath is useful Avhen your party hasn’t a
majority in the House.
The biggest “shout” on local record, to
the Avhole Mitcham camp on a route march
during the war, stands to the credit of Frank
Tolley, the Adelaide lawyer who has just
been struck off the rolls. Hospitality with
him was almost a vice. A feAV months .back
he was arrested in the Blue Mountains
(N.S.W.) Avliile making holiday; but he
protested indignantly that the trust moneys
inquired for Avere available, and on his return
to Adelaide the money Avas produced and the
charge lapsed. After this, hoAvever, a similar
charge in respect of some thousands more
was made. He disappeared overseas, and
there was no opposition when the Supreme
Court applied the axe.
Louisa MacPherson. just dead in London,
Avas the widow of the ,T. A. MacPherson Avho
was at the head of a ston-gap Government
in Vic. from September, 1869. till April, 1870.
while James McCulloch Avas having a spell
between his third and fourth Cabinets. As
soon as McCulloch Avas ready to come back
MacPherson joined him as Lands Minister.
It was MacPherson xvho gave Graham Berry
his first chance as a Minister. Berry was
his Treasurer from January to April, 1870.
“Saddler”: While three-fourths of us
poor saddlers have been forced on to a pre-
mature scrap-heap by petrol-driven vehicles,
the saddlers’ signs of John Rourke and Wil-
liam Edmunds have endured at West Mait-
land (N.S.W.). the one since IS3B and the
latter since 1845. Rourke, the original, died
years back, but Edmunds still drops in to sec
that the “boy” is carrying on as in the old
days.
The rising hope of the Westralian Nation-
alists is T. A. L. Davy, M.L.A. for West
Perth. Although this is his first session.
Davy has made such an impression on a
House always critical of clever young men
that already he is regarded as the most
likely successor to Jimmy Mitchell when
that good-natured messer recognises that
leading an Opposition is not his game. Davy
was a Rhodes scholar, and has pursued Costs
since the argument with Fritz, against whom
he strove for some years. He has been pre-
sident of the Westralian section of the Dig-
gers’ League.
After 40 years on the “street,” Thomas
Mitchell, having beaten the Psalmist’s span
by seven years, has called it a fair thing.
Arriving from the distressful country
60 years ago, he began storekeeping
among the cookies
on the gout h
Coast at Milton
(N.S.W.), and
soon picked up
sufficient knowledge
. (and cash) to start
for himself as a
farm- and dairy-
produce merchant
in Sussex-street,
varying the mon-
otony by judging
the dairy-produce
section at the Syd-
ney Royal Agricul-
tural Show and in
the country.

Dr. Charles Mnttci, of the Brisbane Repat.
Hospital, is likely to be the Queensland re-
presentative on the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s Public Health Commission. Few
medical men know Australia as well—or the
other continents, for that matter. When
only a youngster the Doctor established the
first hospital at Kalgoorlie (Hannan’s it
was then), and from the goldfields he went
to Wyndliam, where he was Government
M.O. and magistrate. He served in the
Boer War \yith a Tasmanian contingent,
and was a Peace Ordinance official for a
time (the head of the department was the
late Walter Davidson, subsequently N.S.W.
Governor), after which he was Health Officer
in the British Mediterranean service. Be-
tween 1914 and 1919 he was with the A.I.F.
in Egypt. Gallipoli and France, and with
the British Army in Italy after the German
thrust to the Piave. When typhus and the
Bolshevists were scourging Poland in 1920
Dr. Mattei, now a Lieut.-Col., was ap-
pointed to command the British detachment
on the sanitary cordon it was proposed to
establish between Danzig and the Danube.
But, on second thoughts, it was decided that
the Bolshies would very likely hang him
and his medicoes as counter-revolutionaries
or something of the sort, so the detachment
was never sent.
A lady who amazed English stargazers by
her knowledge of the difficult Einstein theory
was Mrs. G. F. Dodwell, the just-dead wife
of Adelaide’s Government Astronomer. She
illustrated her interesting lectures by lantern-
slides of her own photographs. Charity work
and an enthusiasm for the League of the
Empire helped to keep the frail but ener-
getic lady busy.
From the Turf Club down to the local
band practically every sporting or other body
in Stanley (Tas.) is looking for a president
or a patron, since chemist 11. G. Spicer
passed on, at S 3. A dispenser of pills and
potions for nearly GO years, he started life
on Melbourne Argus as a printer. He was
an inter-State rifle shot; and when the first
English cricket eleven visited the Speck, in
1542, he captured eight wickets for 50 runs..
“11. Horsceollar”: This cheery cablegram
came from London on October 8: —
To-day being the 155th anniversary of Captain
Cook’s discovery of New Zealand, Captain Kirk, of
Gisborne, on behalf of the Poverty Bay schools,
presented a New Zealand flag to the school at
Marton, Yorkshire, where Captain Cook was born.
Abel Tasman, who did a lot of research along
the Australian coast and left his name on
Tasmania, found and named New Zealand
in 1642. Captain Cook found it 127 years
. later, in 17G9. With much smaller resources
and no Government support. I discovered
and partially explored the Maoriland group
in 1897, or 110 years after Cook. There
were visitors between Tasman and Cook,
as well as between Cook and me, but that
doesn’t affect the importance of my work.
The most noted rider of the bucking
brumby in the N.S.W. 'Western districts of
a day that is dead was Isaac Fitzsimmons,
who went further west near Mudgee the
other day. He was 74 when Time’s girths
broke.
THE MODESTY OF MERIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Air. T. Pascoe, opposing the Recommendation for
Honors Regulation Bill in the S.A. Leg. Council,
pointed out that sensitive men who had done service
to the State would object to having the question of
their recognition b.v honors discussed in parliament.
■ •••The bill was designed to break the bonds that
held the Empire together.”
Jones is a man of just the class
That would adorn our roll of knights;
He made a pile promoting fights,
The ponies bring him stacks of brass.
Brown won to credit and renown
On vats of beer. A step in rank
Should gratify the chaps who drank
His wholesale wares as well as Brown.
Bill Thomson’s keen financial sense
In floating companies displayed
And mastering all the tricks of trade
Has justly earned him eminence.
Joe Johnson steered the city craft—
Lord Mayor he —through heaving seas,
And weathered many a boisterous breeze
Fanned by obnoxious hints at graft.
They did not keep in miser’s fists
Or spend, self-centered, all their dough ;
Their hearts with patriot impulse glow,
Attested by subscription lists.
Who merit more the royal touch
That turns the Alistcrs into Sirs?
Lustre for sure the King confers
Upon the land in honoring such.
Yet many a philanthropic gent
Waiting for honor’s fount to spray
Alight contemplate with blank dismay
X-raying first by Parliament.
And many a man who’s served the State
AVoulcl manifest reluctance just
At having his career discussed,
His virtues canvassed in debate.
The noblest soul has noisest foes,
Which not improbably is true
Of Thomson and of Johnson, too—
And Jones and Brown, one may suppose.
Spare then their lips this bitter cup!
To curb the flow of K.B.E.’s
And similar junk from overseas
Alight smash our grand old Empire up.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Morob”: The crocodile is not always
found close to water, as is generally thought. In
New Guinea I have seen a full-grown specimen well
over three miles from the nearest stream, and on
another occasion I found the fresh tracks of one
nearly five miles from the Warriar River. I have
heard also of natives having surprised a croc, basking
in the sun close on seven miles from the river which
it was known to haunt, the natives having followed
its tracks in the soft ground for the whole of that
distance. The natives say that when a crocodile
exhausts the food possibilities of one river or creek,
or when it is attacked by man so often that its
usual home is unhealthy, it simply leaves and strikes
into the bush, keeping going until it comes to
another river. There is nothing about the anatomical
structure of the croc, which suggests that Nature
intended it to live always close to or actually in
water; its body is just as adapted for dry land as
for an entirely amphibious existence. This does
not, however, apply to the alligator or to the cay-
man of South American rivers.
* * * *
“Mag” : The lucerne-eating wild duck re-
ferred to by “Sarah” (B. n/9/’24) is evidently the
wood-duck. A couple of acres would be only the
first course on the menu for a good flock of these
marauders. The wood-duck is the most destructive
pest the Queensland lucerne grower has to contend
with, and the daybreak blunderbuss detonations are
equalled only by the exp -ive personal opinions of
Cocky when he discovers as much as 20 acres riddled
in one night. And the irony of it is that the pest
enjoys the Game Law protection extended to its
more harmless relative.
• * * #
“Pick”: The Abo:;, who lately expounded
their knowledge of lamb-tailing do not appeal to
me as scientists. The second joint from the butt
(easily found by thumb-pressure) is the place to cut,
and, “J. Roo” (B. 18/9/’24) notwithstanding, that
will leave, in the grown sheep, a rudder of two
inches. Except in very fat lambs there will be
little bleeding; there is apparently no pain from
such a (lean cut, and speedy healing follows without
tar or other applications. But the untaught or care-
less lopper who ruthlessly severs the bone causes the
lamb much suffering and, in well-grown specimens,
many a subsequent death.
* * * *
“Q.Q.Q.”: How does this vegetable com-
pare with its indigenous relations? A Spanish chest-
nut-tree adorns the grounds of Brooklands, New
Plymouth (M.L.). It was planted in 1846 and Ms
dimensions now are: .Circumference of branches, 279 ft. ;
diameter of branches, 93ft. ; diameter of bole, sft. 4in.
The whole supplies shade to nearly a quarter-acre
of ground. When Newton King purchased the
property 30-odd years ago the tree would not bear
nuts. On the advice of an old English gardener,
another tree of the same species was planted in che
vicinity. In three years the old tree bore a good
crop, and every year sees more.
* * * *
“Nitric”: At Coolangatta (Q.) a marine
duel between a couple
of fair-sized whales and
the same number of
“thrasher” sharks lately
occurred. The shares,
sometimes known as sea
foxes ( Alopias vulpes),
had as allies several
sword-fish, and they
made joint attacks on
the poor old mammals.
The fray took place
about half a mile from
the beach, and the
manoeuvres of the con-
testants were plainly
visible. The sword-fish
always tackle from be-
low, and thus drive the
whale to the surface,
where the thrashers put
their spoke in, largely
from above. The latter
leap clean out of tue
water and plunged on
the enemy, the digs
being accompanied by
clouds of spray. On one
occasion I noted two
thrashers making a
united attack on one
whale, and at one stage
of the fight both re-
mained poised upright
in the air for several
seconds, apparently en-
deavoring to balance on
the whale beneath. The
fight lasted fully half
an hour, and then the
two spouters passed
round Pt. Danger mak-
ing soutli full steam
ahead.
“Mapee” : “Borom” is a bit out in assert-
ing that the flycatching plant he describes (B.
25/9/’24) is found only in the Middle Harbor dis-
trict, near Sydney. It is to be found over much of
the eastern seaboard of Australia, and on the western
slopes of the New England Range. It is something
of a pest in the lawns in some Brisbane suburbs,
coming up in a thick mat, to the detriment of
couch and other lawn grasses. The hairs on the
inside of the bowl-like flower are all hooked inwards,
and at the bottom of the cup is a honey-like sub-
stance—the lure for sweet-palated insects. When
one of these, such as the small native bee, goes after
the sv T eets, the outer rim of the bowl contracts,
throwing ' the hooked hairs over the insect
and holding it until all its juices have
been extracted, leaving only the hard, shelly
parts,- wings, legs, etc. The process in the
case of the native bee—who is a frequent victim-
takes about three days, after which the residue is
ejected, and the plant resumes its lying-in-wait.
“Colub”: Recently I was shown an imma-
ture black snake, just on 11 in. long, which when dis-
sected proved to possess fully-developed poison-fangs
and secretory apparatus. The fangs were small but
perfectly formed, and would have been quite capable
of injecting venom; and its glands were full. The
color of the venom was somewhat lighter than the
secretion of the black snake generally is, but this
SOMETHING IN THE SAME LINE.
PARENT: “ And has my daughter made you a very obedient wife?”
SON-IN-LAW ( gloomily ): “Er — well, hardly. But she’s made me
a very obedient husband.”
is no clue to its toxic properties, since the hue of
venom depends as a rule on the nature of the food
that the snake has been eating. In most cases the
fangs of a poisonous snake do not appear until their
owner is almost full grown, and it is not rare to
find fair-sized young snakes in which they are
either entirely absent or else of only a rudimentary
character. The development of the glands starts soon
after birth, and in many specimens they are full-sized
when the fangs are only just beginning to grow. The
only snake which possesses both fangs and glands
from birth, and is able to inject venom into a
victim when it is only a few days old, is a small
reptile found in Northern Africa, whose poison is
of an extremely toxic nature. Cases have been known
fir which one of these snakes' only three days old has
caused the death of a man within a couple of hours.
* * * *
“FY7”: “Jeobb” (B. 11/9/’24) invites
the opinion of the council as to why his Katherine
River (N.T.) donkeys have so many deformed off-
spring. “Jeobb” says it can’t be inbreeding, for
a new Jack has been imported without bettering
matters. Yet inbreeding is undoubtedy the cause.
“Jeobb” falls into the old error of imagining that
the introduction of a new sire will cure herd faults.
All the new sires in creation won’t eradicate these
faults while the strain of the dams, the fountain-
head of breeding, remains polluted. Let “Jeobb”
cull his lady donkeys mercilessly, induce as many
of the remainder as possible to take vows of celibacy,
and bring over a batch of new ladies from that Grove
Hill strain he is talking about. If the result isn’t
satisfactory, I’ll eat a copy of the S. M. Herald
without beer.
* * * *
“Handy Andy”: Talking of queer kinks
in the maternal instinct. We had a quiet old ma
cat whose chief aim in life seemed to be to populate
Australia. On one occasion she gave birth to five
kittens, four of which were promptly drowned. The
smallness of her family seemed to depress the old
lady, and she was disconsolate until she gathered to
herself two chickens a few days old whose mother
had provided a meal for a hawk. Pussy adopted ihe
orphans, and whilst her solitary kitten was enjoying
his meals the chicks would snuggle under her fur,
only showing the point of their beaks and a pair
of bright little eyes. They seemed to enjoy them-
selves except when the maternal instinct prompted
puss to lick them as she did her kitten. Then
they would retreat for cover.
• • • *
“Billy Brolga”: Re calves born with
natural earmarks. A neighbor of ours a while back
had a roan cow which gave birth to several young
bellowers, each with the ma’s earmark —a piece sliced
off one ear. About six years ago a milker belong-
ing to a relative came home one morning with a
red bull calf which bore the registered earmark of
another settler in the district, the only difference
being that both ears were marked and the gap
rounded and filled with hair. The remarkable part
of it was that no connection between the mother and
the other man’s cattle could be traced.
“Merrigal”: Our Warrigal, a black boot
on one foot and a tan one on the other, each polished
to kill, encountered the manager at the local show.
“Flash pair of boots you’re wearing,” said he.
“Too right, boss,” said Warrigal. “And 1 gotta
another pair longa camp just the plurry same.”
* * * *
“Colub”: The death from snakebite of a
young woman who was
bitten by a black snake
while she was gathering
wild flowers at Middle
Harbor, Sydney, illus-
Mates the danger that lies
in the ordinary venom-
ous snake at the end of
the reptile’s period of
hibernation. When it
emerges its poison glands
are fuller than at an.v
other time since the
venom has been accumu-
lating; and tne gland
secretion is not re-
absorbed. The unfortu-
nate victim in the Sydney
case received most likely
three or four times the
volume of venom that the
snaue would be able in
inject later on in the
season. The toxicity of
black, brown and tiger
snakes is largely a mal-
ter of season; in addi-
tion, it depends a good
deal on circumstances.
Thus a snake is compara-
tively harmless just after
it has had a large meal,
for the reason that the
greater part of the venom
is injected into the- rep-
tile’s food for digestive
purposes, and so its
glands are almost empty.
It is comparatively harm-
less also for an hour or
so after it has bitten
something, since it re-
quires some time for the
glands to fill up again.
The Oriental fakirs who
let cobras bice them with-
out suffering an/ ill-
effects, after they lui'c
first made the sn-vee bite
a fowl or a dog so show
how deadly u is, employ
this fact to their advantage.

“Loxo”: Enter for the Queer Accident
Stakes William Pearson, of Echuca (Vic.), who fell
head foremost down a hole prepared for a telegraph
pole. He had jumped forward in the darkness to
catch his little daughter, who had tripped on the
oath. His head became fast in the hole, like a
cork in a bottle, and it was only after some strong
men had tugged strenuously at his legs that he was
released. His nose and mouth were full of mud,
and in a few minutes he would have been smothered.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Pick’s” bantam cock-
erel which fathered the orphan chicks (B. 12/9/’24)
recalls a. gander we had some years back. 1 noticed
him one morning fussing about a coop in which was
a clutch of newly-hatched chicks. I thought at first
he was trying to kill the youngsters, but on watch-
ing him for a while saw that his hostility was
directed against the hen, w'hom he seemed intent on
plucking bare. He became so troublesome that he
had to be locked up. The following morning, when
I went out to feed the fowls, 1 saw the old boy stand-
ing on one leg some distance away from the coop,
with the clutch of chickens feeding around him. He

was as proud as Punch, and chased everything that
came near. When the hen was let out there was a
battle royal, but in the end the gander had to admit
her into the family circle. The hen became quite
reconciled in a day or two, and together they shep-
herded the youngsters, not one of which -was lost.
But the old boy never quite got used to the chickens
roosting on his back when he settled down for a
snooze.

THE HORSEY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, what’s become of the horsey man? You seldom
see him ride
Along the street at a canter neat, with his face lit
up with pride.
He goes no more to the stable door to groom and
saddle the hack,
Or yoke a pair to the pole with care behind the
brown and the black.
The stalls he managed with fork and broom were
always tidy and clean,
But now they reek with the fumes that leak from
stocks of “gasoline.”
The boss took pride in his thoroughbred and his
dashing team of four

lle used to lurch with his riding crop away from
the hitching post,
And the pace of his horse on the picnic course was
ever his loudest boast.
You felt assured by his riding rig, with the breeches
cut to fit,
No mettlesome prad, half-tamed or “bad,” would
trouble him much to sit.
And his four-in-hand was a clubroom word with
men of the rnulga class,
Expounding points over grills or joints or over a
friendly glass.
Now the horsey man is a weedy man who gallops
to lose —or win—-
Astride a horse on a crowded course with his knees
beneath his chin.
Or he sits long hours on a hansom cab, that relic of
bygone days,
While the horse craves ease for its broken knees,
and the cab no longer pays.

For his rowdy fare could guzzle and swear in the

With many a sigh as the east mounts high while the

record. There can be no doubt as to the identity

“Six and Eight”: The queer accidents
mentioned by “Bareoo” and “Alpha” in recent Bur-
lktins recall one which happened in the ’seventies
during a shearing at Coolamigel station (N.S.W.).
Wolseley had not then invented his shearing machines,
so all shearers were using the blades. A struggling
wether caught his hoof in the bow of the shears
used by the man shearing him and sent them flying
through the shed. They struck a rouseabout. in
the 'groin and severed the femoral artery. No one
present knew anything of first aid, and the efforts
to apply a tourniquet being ineffective, the unfortunate
rouseabout bled to death in a few r minutes. Apropos,
and because sometimes the knowledge may mean the
difference between life and death, let Abo.-ites note
that it is difficult for a layman to apply a tourniquet
effectively in such cases. This is because the artery
is deep-seated. A good first-aid method is to press
heavily with the ball of the thumb on the artery
where it passes over the pelvic bone. Till medical
aid is obtained it is essential for this pressure to be
maintained. The amount necessary' is great, and
one person can only keep it up for a few minutes.
Therefore, to do the job thoroughly, relays must be
arranged till skilled aid arrives.

“M.J.”: The now numerous chamois which
range over parts of the Southern Alps in Maoriland
are descended from those presented to the Government
by the Emperor Franz Josef, but they are not diffi-
cult to locate, as “Bobbo’s” par. (B. 25/9/’24) im-
plies. Anyone who walks up to the snowfields at the
head of the Hooker Valley will find plenty of their
tracks and quite likely see one or more herds making
up the slopes at an amazing pace, or bounding up
almost vertical rock faces. They are shy, but about
six years ago there was at any rate one exception in
an old buck who made a practice of literally butting
into parties of tourists that entered his domain. In
the course of one of these unwelcome visits he
attacked a lady so savagely that the guide in charge
was forced to kill him with an ice-axe. The ani-
mals are protected, but in this instance “safety
first” over-rode the regulations.

“Well, there's no accounting fer tastes.”
“Gouger”: Out on the Upper Bueca
ranges, near Coramba (N.S.W.), the other day, I
shot a dingo which had the scalps of 2G calves to
his credit, but was minus a skull-cap of his own.
His bald head gave him a most curious look as he
loped through the scrub. On examination he proved
to have been scalped quite a long time ago. Appar-
ently he had been shot or caught in a trap, and,
after being knocked on the head, had been scalped and
left for dead. That he came to life again is proof
of his invincible constitution, and perhaps also his
cunning. Many wild things can sham death per-
fectly in the face of great peril.
“Troophorse”: Buffalo were first landed
in the Northern Territory at Fort Dundas, Melville
Island, in 1824, and while that
settlement lasted some 1000 of the
animals were secured from Timor.
A Mr. Barnes, who owned a small
schooner, Stedcombe, had u con-
tract to land as many as he could
at. the rate of 25 dollars a head.
The brig Lady Nelson also did
several trips for buffalo. Another
hard old-timer, Captain J. Grimes,
master and owner of the smart
little brig Lucy Anne, likewise
had a contract with the Command-
ant for buffalo at the 25-dollar
rate ; but he also used to run grog
that was readily purchased by the
convicts. When * ort Dundas was
throw’ll up on March 31, 1829, the
live stock was transferred to the
settlement of Fort Wellington at
Raffles Bay, some 130 miles east-
ward. Buffalo hail already been
landed on the mainland there in
the year 1827. The same J.
Grimes did the job : and he brought
also a few Timor ponies. During
the occupation of Wellington a
large number of buffalo escaped
and were never caught. When
Capt. Gordon Bremer started the
settlement at Victoria, Fort Easing -
ton, in IS3S, more buffalo were
brought from Timor. These settle-
ments depended upon the beasts
for their meat supply, and at
Fort Dundas as many as 18 were
killed a month. So the herds
that formed on the mainland and
Melville Island started from strays
that should have been turned into
tucker. Indian cattle, English
cattle, pigs, goats of many breeds,
horses, fowls, sheep and other
animals of the farmyard were
let go wild when these settle-
ments were left. The buffalo
are now’ roaming right along the
N.T. seafront. A remarkable
thing is that when the old bulls
are bossed out of the herd they
strike east for the ' Queensland
border, while the old cows make
in the opposite direction.
“Akran”: It looks as if “E.W.M.’s” record
of 125 inches of rain in eight months at Innisfail
(Q.) is unbeatable (B. 25./9/’24) ; but I would like
to know if a fine day or two were included in that
eight months. At Tweed Heads, the wettest spot in
the Ma State, a few years ago it rained continu-
ously' for three months. There wasn’t a dry minute
in it, let alone a fine day. And that ought to be
a record, anyhow.
* * * *
"Nitric”: The statement made by
“Gouger” (B. 11/9/’24) concerning the calf which
was born with an ear clip similar to its mother's
hinges on the transmission of
acquired characteristics. An ac-
quired characteristic is defined as
a feature developed during the life
of the animal possessing it, in
response to environment. The
majority of biologists deny the in-
heritance of such characteristics.
An experiment was performed on
guinea-pigs. The sciatic nerve
was cut, and in consequence, sen-
sation was lost in the hind limbs,
with the result that many gnawed
therh off. A small proportion of
the offspring from these also lacked
hind toes. But this was explained
by the supposition that at birth
the limbs were perfect, the dams
later mutilating their young. All
rodents have a tendency to these
acts, and in this case the habit
was unusually developed. I have
heard of cases where the brand or
a mark similar to it was trans-
mitted, but found the yarns would
not bear investigation. At the
present moment 1 have a Pomer-
anian bitch which has had three
litters of pups. The first was by
a Pomeranian dog, the second by
a fox-terrier, and the third by a
Pomeranian dog. In the last
litter, of . three, one undoubtedly
has the fox-terrier characteristics,
even to color and build. I am
now satisfied about telegony, but
cannot accept “Gouger’s” conclu-
sions on transmission of acquired
characteristics.
“Akran”: “Greenpea” asks if birds and
animals imitate one another. Birds do. I had a
magpie that could do almost anything when I was
gt Alstonville (N.S.W. North Coast). Of he
couldn’t help me shift the milk from Strawberry, but
every morning he’d rise with the fowls (as a matter
of fact, he slept with them) and, running to the
nearest fence, he’d hop up on the top rail and
imitate a crowing cock to a nicety. I have often
seen him stand over a grub, and, again imitating
the rooster, draw the hens to him with his call.
Many a time the kiddies have run to the fowl-
house to find Jacko perched on the side of a box-
nest making a noise for all the world like a hen
that has just laid an egg.
THE USEFUL SEX.
“I ’ope you don’t drink , little man? ’
“Madame, I hare never tasted it."
“Well, then, ’old this bottle. I dunno what we'd do
without you teetotallers —a lady would 'are to
carry ’er own booze.”
"Lexo”: There is something almost un-
canny about the accuracy with which some men can
judge the weight of a beast. At the recent Mel-
bourne Show competition A. 0. Meyers, of Bacchus
Marsh, guessed within half a pound of the correct
weight (11311b.). No less than seven competitors,
one of them a woman, got within a pound of the
bull’s-eye. There were a few mugs in it, too. One
reckoned the beast would supply 90,0841b. of beef,
while another estimated there would be only llllb.
* * * *
"Septa": What fencing-wire is to the bush
in Australia kunda cane is to both
Europeans' and natives in New
Guinea, and the uses to which the
handy article is put are legion.
One frequently sees houses in which
it takes the place of nails, lengths
of it being used to fasten the
rafters together. On lonely tracks
in the bush it comes in handy to*
making “suspension” bridges over
gorges which would otherwise be
impassable, the method being to
stretch one cane-rope across and
then rig another length about four
feet higher, so that a man walks
on the lower rope and hangs on
to the upper one. When cut into
suitable pieces and properly dried
it makes excellent walking-sticks,
a fact that has been quickly recog-
nised by the Japenese in Rabaul,
who have built up a fair-sized
trade with Japan, England and
America. As the fibre lends it-
self to carving, some of the ex-
ports are works of art, and in
Europe they are bringing as much
as 30s. and £2 each.
“Yarrum” : Recently I saw a man thrash-
ing the shallows of Lake Macquarie (N.S.W.) with a
whip consisting of many lengthy strands of barbed
wire. Young mutilated mullet were flying in all
directions. Asked if it were not a pity to destroy
so many baby fish, he said: “Yairs, but I’m after
bait, and it’s an easy way to get it.” One of these
hoodlums would kill more fish in five minutes than
20 shags could in a week. They want stopping.
* -*■ * *
“Ragar”: “S.T.S.” mentions three methods
of preventing sand-drift (B. 18/9/’24) that have all
been “used with success,” but neglects to say how
the sand was induced to stop drifting while the
various crops of early oats, lucerne and rye-grass
germinated, grew and attained maturity. Some
time ago I saw something of the sort tried in Queens-
land. The owner of the sand had been trying to
keep it inside his fences for years, but always, long
before anything green had a chance of appearing,
the surface had moved elsewhere and taken the seeds .
with it. A Cape farmer of my acquaintance did the
trick with some acres of fine, powdery sand, but he
had to spread a hundred tons of straw over the sur-
face first, and this, as it was laid, he covered with
a heavy top-dressing of earth. He then manured
the soil and allowed it to remain idle until heavy-
rains had thoroughly soaked it. Then lucerne was
sown thickly all over it, allow T ed to grow and seed,
after which it w r as turned in with the plough. That
treatment proved entirely satisfactory; though with-
out the necessary rainfall to ensure germination of
the seed it is doubtful whether the arrangement would
have withstood anything in the way of wind.
* * * *
“Bad Australian”: According to the early
navigators, the Swan River (W.A.) must have been
a sportsman’s Paradise. Kangaroo, dingoes and
emus were very numerous, and the number of swans,
ducks and pelicans seen on the river “was truly
astonishing.” Fish, turtle and sealions were found
in abundance, and one of the French navigators
claims to have met a sealion in the woods near the
river. The same voyager found “hares” and “part-
ridges” on several of the neighboring islands. The
partridges were probably some kind of quail; but
what the hares were is a mystery. When the ill-
fated Capt. Barker was investigating the country
near the mouth of the Murray, his people caught
large numbers of fish, “among others a kind of salmon
which resembled in shape, taste, and color of iis
flesh, the salmon of Europe.” What is that fish called
nowadays ?
* # * *
“Centre”: The experiment with climbing
plants mentioned by “Morob” (B. 18/9/’24) has
been made in N. Queensland with various kinds of
beans. The guada bean seemed to be able to think
for itself, searching for and finding the supports
placed about sft. away from it. The loofah and the
New Guinea bean both contrived to finally reach
similar supports. On the other hand, the Bombay
butter bean showed no such capacity to find a support,
although it will grow to a length of 30ft. to 40ft.
when ‘ started at the bottom of one. Still, I don’t
believe there is anything in the idea of plants possess-
ing intelligence; I fancy that as they start to grow
their slender stems are blown this way and that,
and on coming into contact with anything their
tendrils take a natural hold.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: During the summer months a
goanna can lie for hours in the sun without being
attacked by crows, for the excellent reason that the
reptile is in hot weather a vigorous and formidable
antagonist. But let a go. venture out of a hollow
tree during the late winter weeks, when he is
sluggish and incapable of defending himself, and crows
will immediately assail him. Yes, he’s a cunning
1 customer is the crow.
* * * *
“Veronal”: Not even the domestic hen,
brave as she is in the face of enemies, cares for her
. chicks more seriously than does the black-fronted
: dottrel. Whenever danger threatens, the mother-
bird gives a peculiar call and the drab-grey downy
chicks immediately nestle beside stones, sticks, or
other debris, or squat flat on the ground and remain
as still as death until the coast is again clear. When
,l in hiding, the young dottrels, like spur- wing plover
A TIP FOR DOW GAN.
“ Doiogan, git a move on wid your pick. I’ve bin teat chin
ye for the last ten minutes, an’ divil a move 'are
ye made.”
“Aw come orf! How cud ya tell w’en ya wuz behind the
toolhouse?”
“Let me put ye wise to this, me man—if Dowgan's
shadow don’t move Dowgan don’t move,”
chicks, are most difficult to discover, as the neutral
tint of their feathers closely harmonises with*their
surroundings. The parent birds also endeavor to
lure the intruder away by simulating broken wings.
I have seen a red-capped dottrel even flutter into
shallow water and lie on the surface to draw off
attention from its nest—a mere hollow in the soil
which contained three pointed eggs, very large for
so small a bird. The landrail (pectoral rail), on
the other hand, trusts to thick grassy cover to
conceal her chicks, but I have surprised the mother
bird with a brownish-grey brood at her heels cross-
ing swiftly from one patch of cover to another.
Just recently a hen was seen engaged in battle on the
ground with a raven, usually styled “crow.” She
beat off the enemy without losing a single chicken
of her clutch of 12.

Phones Central 1632, 1633.
Saturday’s continuous downpour, which
robbed the Caulfield Guineas meeting of its
social thrill and frill, failed to intimidate
the petticoated enthusiasts a bit. Com-
fortably macintoslied and umbrella-ed above
flesh-colored silk hose, the female stoics
splashed across the flooded swards between
the three stands, shod with the thinnest of
pump-soled evening footwear. Groups of
flappers, with faces pinked and whitened
like Geisha-girls, twittered disconsolately in
the back of the stands, fearful of trusting
their painted masks to the elements. Owner
Courteen’s nice-looking wife saw Heroic’s
great win from a third-row seat. “Why,”
eoo-eed a feminine pal from the rear, “you
are not as excited as I am!” “But,” ic-
torted Mrs. Courteen, turning a ghostly-
white face to the interjector, “you don’t
know how I feel.” The vice-regal pen was
untenanted, ivliile the stewards’ box was
only lightly peopled. Priminister Bruce’s
wife, in black, kept out the draughts with
an ermine wrap; and Mrs. Bob Bruce snug-
gled in a seal coat collared with ’possum.
Mrs. Leslie MacDonald brightened the dun
landscape with mustard yellow tailorings
topped with a brown-plumed hat; while
Mrs. George Woodforde wore coat and skirt
of navy, lighted up by a red hat. Mrs. Ben
Chaffey warmed her navy tailorings with
a brown wrap, and flew a dash of scarlet
on her hat. Mrs. Russell Gabb thrilled
under Kolinsky furrings at Suomi’s Caul-
field Cup chance. Mrs. Philip Russell and
her sister, Ella Guthrie, stood out in well-
cut black tailored coats, with collars of grey
fur. One or two smart dressers back from
overseas drew troubled glances with their
wide-brimmed Queen Maryish hats, tilted
noseward by back hair-knobs. “Mid-Vic-
torian !” sniffed a shingled flapper. But
she was wrong: the tilted hats are the
scouts and outposts of to-morrow’s styles.
A best-dressed crowd flooded Her Majesty’s
from front stalls to back gallery to hear
Dame Nellie warble her swan song in
the Limbless Soldiers’ cause. Every woman
almost in the house carried a posy to bom-
bard the farewelling diva; and sales of
souvenir programmes, sweets and flowers
helped to swell the profits, which, with a
£2500 cheque from the football match, sub-
scriptions, raffles, etc., totalled an amazing
£lB,OOO. The number of girl brigands far ex-
ceeded their usefulness; they not only
tumbled over each other, but held up the
traffic between acts. Ellaline Terriss, charm-
ing in pale-pink hangings, dispensed Melba
photos (at a guinea and ten shillings'), tra-
versing each row in turn. Lady Forster,
who had crossed from Sydney especially to
be there, revealed a peep of blue frock and
her diamond tiara from the fastness of a
flower-trimmed pen. With her was Captain
Pitt Rivers. The Stradbrokes were kept
away by the continued illness of their small-
est son, Christopher. The Mayoral Brun-
tons were boxed with ex-Speaker Mackey’s
widow.
Muriel Starr has packed away the western
frocks and eastern robes of Eurasian Daisy,
and is now airing a trunk-load of new
dresses in her old best-seller. “Bought and
Paid For.” Her shingled poll collides some-
what with the feminine seductiveness of the
clinging garments. The black frock in which
she tempts Robert Stafford into making a
proposal is distinctive with a new-way ruffle
which meanders its snowy course to the waist,
of the cross-over bodice. After spurning
husband Robert’s attentions and riches she
hides her poverty in buttons, which spot the
side fastening of her black frock from shoul-
der to hem-line. Jessie Page, as her sister,
airs a ball frock of much attractiveness in
jade-green brocade flecked with silver, with
ostrich feathers fluffing the tunic hem; but
the dress which will be copied by dozens of
amateur dress builders is of dove-grey silk,
between a tunicked frock and a coat and
skirt, and is brightened with rose color on
the chest and sleeve ends. Quite a number
of the best-known helped to fill the house on
Saturday night and shower floral offerings
on the stage. Dame Mary Hughes, thinner
than before she went on her America’ l jaunt,
sat in the front circle with Mrs. Scott.
The Women’s Automobile Club president,
Mrs. 11. A. Robertson, warmed the new
club rooms in Champion’s Buildings last
Friday night with a musical jollo punctu-
ated with jazz. The big parlors carried the
fragrance of Spring in masses of white and
purple lilacs blossoming from every available
niche. Mrs. Robertson lighted misty black-
ness with a red presentation bouquet to
match the scarlet flower poised Carmen-wise
in her dark hair. Her husband helped her
to see that everyone had a good time. \ ic-
tor Baxter sang, but his tenor appears to
have been a trifle forced in the Obolensky
hothouse. Dr. Bartolini’s rich baritone exem-
plified the value of a highly-finished train-
ing. The Scotch visiting singer, William
Ileughan, who came as a guest, gener-
ously offered to reinforce the song pro-
gramme, and his three inimitable contribu-
tions were cheered rapturously. With him
were Mrs. Ileughan. manager Kennedy and
the little Adelaide violinist, Lilian Bother.
The people who went to Anzac House last
week to eat a “Vitamines Luncheon” at
the invitation of the Australian Dried Fruits
Association were relieved, to find that the
fish and meat labelled with question-marks
on the menu weren’t really decomposed:
they were only deficient in vitamines, whereas
other items, such as dried-fruits, were so
overcrowded with the capricious little things
as to almost constitute slums or congested
areas. Nevertheless the lunch was so good
that Prendergast was moved to declare that
fruit should be regarded not as a luxury
but as a necessity for even the poorest, and
that his Government was out to make it so
—though he was vague about the method.
Dr. Payne Pliilpots asserted that if every
Australian ate the 101 b. of fruit weekly he
should eat, the total yearly requirement
v/ould be 1,307,726 tons; whereas this season
the production was only 447,424 tons, and 70
per cent, had to be exported. Nobody com-
puted how much of it was left lying under
the trees because it didn’t pay to pick and
market; and that’s a little job Mr. Pren-
dergast might attend to.
Ten Melbourne charitable institutions got
windfalls the other day from the estate of
the late James Mason, of St. Kilda. Eight
received £6OOO each, and the other £6OOO was
divided equally between a girls’ and a boys'
orphanage run under the patronage of the
same saint.
Newspaper men will drop their quills and
roll up in force at the United Press Ball to
be held in the Melbourne Town Hall on the
eve of the Cup. Square dances and an old-
time waltz are in the programme for the
benefit of those who have not had time to
learn to jazz. Only a select few outside the
four great daily offices of Melbourne will
have the privilege of attending what pro-
mises to be a memorable Cup Week flutter.
This pleasing Humphries picture of the
lady under the big hat introduces you to
Mrs. Barry Thompson, wife of the well-
known Mel-
bourne doctor.
She is helping
to organise the
matinee o f
“O Id B i 11”
w hich the
1 high Ward-
Fuller c o m-
bination will
stage on Octo-
ber 21 to. help
the Roman
Catholic Or-
phanages. Her
helping hand
was extended
to innumerable
charities dur-
ing the war,
but the call of
the children is
what she lis-
tens for most
nowadays. As
president of the Alfred Hospital’s entertain-
ments committee she spends some breathless
weeks at the end of each year preparing the
Christmas-tree cheerio for the inmates of the
kiddies’ ward of that great institution.
While all sorts of fun suitable to the small
patients is dispensed by the lady and her
helpers, they don’t allow Santa Clans to for-
get the white-capped nurses. She and her
medical husband are feeling desolate just
now without their only sou, Jack, who
tripped off the other day to study music in
Italy.
Out-patients at the Women’s Hospital are
offering up thanksgivings for the canteen
which, owing to the generosity of certain
city firms and citizens, now provides food
and drink at bedrock cost for the waiting
women and babes at the far end of the big
ball. At the opening Mayoress Brunton,
welcomed by the president, Mrs. Hiskens,
beamed over presentation forget l -me-nots
springing from a crimson bed of carnations.
The proposal of Dr. Nattrass, head of the
medical staff, to instal a listening-in outfit
in the outpatients’ waiting-room, received
no petticoat approval: every woman felt that
concatenations of the loud-speaker would be
the last straw to sick and anxious women.
After the unveiling committee members and
white-capped nurses dispensed the cake that
sustains and the cup that cheers.
Herbert Johansen, youngest son of the
John Johansen widow, of Allendale, was
married to St. Kilda girl Shirley Harriman.
at the Sacred Heart Church, last week. The
pretty bride’s white moire was misted with
a Limerick lace veil lent by Mrs. Sylvester
Firth, of Sydney; and bridesmaid Jessie
Rowden and the small trainbearer, Bonnie
Chaplin, fluttered amber georgette, with gold

bridal bell of pink and white roses sent out
silent peals of perfume above the junketing.
The Artie Staughtons have just welcomed
a new daughter, which the undiscriminating
Stork left at their Western District squat-
tage, Keayang, the other day. If it had been
a boy—they have five daughters now and no
son—the bird would have been more popular.
The eldest Stoughton girl, Mrs. Oliphant
Shaw, lately arrived from her husband’s Rho-

though he has
always had an
affection for
Sydney—where
he has lived
since he left
off being gen-
eral - manager
of the Bank
of Queensland
-—the southern
States have
not seen much
of him. Mr.
Lees—who is a
bachelor not
past middle age—was born in Jersey, where
he learned to lisp in French; then, his
mother dying, a grandparent took him to the
Hebrides, and for the next few years he spoke
Gaelic; after that he went to London, and
began to talk finance; and, moving to Queens-
land in his early twenties, he settled down to
be a fervid Australian.
Leon Heron, whose black-and-white work
has often appeared in The Bulletin, is
seeking the bubble reputation which is
earned at the critics’ mouth in a one-man
show at the Sackville Galleries next week.
Young Leon, who is a son of the general
manager of the Commercial Bank, is only
24, but he has done a vast amount of deco-
rative work already. His first essays in any
medium were furtive caricatures of the
masters of Melbourne Church of England
Grammar School; but they gained him no
red wafers.
As anticipated. Melbourne’s Mayor Brun-
fon has been given a second term; and
F. G. 11. Ritchie will wear the fur-tipped
gown at Geelong for a year. The two cities
work under the same antiquated Act.
The Lyceum Club rooms sheltered a meet-
ing of the newly-resurrected Dante Society
last week, when Dr. Balboni and Signor
Benini entertained a large gathering with
rival readings from Italian literature, fol-
lowed by charming song items by l)r. Pelle-
gatti, a quite-recently imported songbird, and
a rendering of the Balcony Scene from
“Romeo and Juliet” by Alba Zacutti. Sig-
nora Benini, Signor Sacco, Signor Melano,
Madame Zacutti and daughter Wanda, the
H. J. Robertson pair, Mrs. Templeton, Alice
Micliaelis and Alfred Stirling were amongst
the devotees.
A quaint jubilee just celebrated was that
of Christina McKay, who entered the Castle-
maine Benevolent Home 50 years ago. The
ladies of Castlemaine thought the event was
worthy of an entertainment of all the in-
habitants of the home. Next year they may
have another opportunity, for an old gentle-
man of the institution has been there 40
years.
Quite a lot of Anglo-Australians are swap-
ping London’s certain fog for Melbourne's
problematic sunshine. The Alec Landale
widow, who was one of Toorak's old bri-
gade, is one. and tbe widow of the late David
Hennessy. five times Mayor of Melbourne,
is another. The last brings her trio of
girls with her.
Toorak's ex-member, Norman Bayles, will
step ashore from an incoming mail steamer
on a flying visit before returning to his wife
and small son for Christmas. Next year,
when Mrs.'Bayles’s son and daughter by her
first marriage have concluded their college
days, the ex-politician will convoy the lot
back to this city. Buttonholes having re-
turned to favor, one wonders whether
Norman has revived the pre-war touch of
cornflower which was never absent from the
lapel of his check tweed coat.
Enid Fyson, niece of ex-Premier Alex.
Peacock, is, with becoming blushes, acknow-
ledging congratulations on her engagement to
Dr. Arthur TJglow, of Middle Brighton. She
trained as a nurse at the Alfred, and appa-
rently found meds. sufficiently endurable to
chance a partnership for life with one of
them.
The decorative Mrs. George Chiruside is
preparing for the umpteenth time to wave
adieu from the deck of an outward-bound

miss it?
The gay inconsequence of the fair sex
appeared at the annual meeting of the Jour-
nalists’ Association. When the breathless
moment for balloting for tbe next council
came, it transpired that the feminine scribes
had each left it to the other to re-nomi-
nate their special representative, Mrs. White,
who has looked after their interests for the
past 12 months. As a result of their absent-
mindedness the lady, instead of sitting back
in her year-old niche, had to go to the poll
with the male candidates: and —hats off to
mere man ! —she came back as a member of
the executive second on the poll.

A note from Adelaide :
The Mayoress’s rooms at thq Town Hall are kept
busy these days with at-homes and bridge parties
for charities. The Lady Victoria Buxton Girls’ Club
was the last to benefit. Mrs. Charles Todd, a
staunch worker, just back from England, helped the
fixture to success; and in the afternoon Lady
Bridges, Miss Murray, Mrs. Nutter Thomas and Mrs.
Glover were specially bidden to tea. A couple of
days later Mrs. Glover herself was hostess to an-
other party for the members of the Opera Co., with
40 or so special devotees of the season to meet them.
Bishopscourt had a party on a day of glimpsing
sunshine and drifting clouds, in a garden of roses
and massed annuals, with the sombre green of pine
groves in the background. I Tea was indoors, where
the picturesque reception rooms rioted in red and
yellow roses and sweet-scented stocks.
The Royal Academy’s latest report concerning
Helene Taylor endorses all her committee’s enthusi-
asm for her voice and capability. The Board is
so pleased that it has extended her term by a year.
Just back from England, Miss Constance Davey,
the second of the Catherine Helen Spence scholars,
bringing with her a Ph.D. to thread on to her local
M.A. The psychology of the mentally defective
child is her special study.
At the annual meeting of Minda, the home for the
weak-minded, a present roll-call of over 200 was
reported, and an annual expenditure of close on
.■611,000. This is one of the few charities that seem
to have little difficulty in inducing income to
match expenditure. Its present property at
Brighton is rapidly becoming valuable as suburban
land, and 20 acres of it sold recently realised
.68654. Lately the Home has established a farm
at Blackwood as an offshoot, and annexed first prize
at the Sturt Show with its apples.
“Tosca.” rang down the final curtain on Grand
Opera, with a. stage so massed with flowers that
Scavizzi lost her way in the absence of footpaths
amongst the impromptu garden. Granforte, unearthed
from the peace of his dressing-room and hunted on
to the stage by Piccaluga, made his farewell bow
in a navy sac suit, and flowers were flung from house
to stage and back to house again. Purse mouth-
pieces have been wide open for bookings, and if a
cold Spring 4x giving the drapers blue shivers,
florists must have reaped a record harvest. And
with it all we’ve had some enthusiasm left, and a
shilling or two, for other causes ; the Bach Society’s
concert and the Two Thousand Voices uproar were
packed, and over £3OO flowed from the latter into
the Children’s Hospital Extension Fund. '
The Derby meeting was dull as far as dressing
went, and the heroines who put on Spring finery
mostly covered it with furs. On Saturday his Ex.
was at Snowtown laying the foundation stone of the
Soldiers’ Memorial Hall, so Lady Bridges gave
Wycherley his blue riband.
London authorities on “precedence” have given
the very latest pronouncement on a claim made by
a former Adelaide “lord mayor” for the alleged
benefit of his successors. The answer is that there
seems to be no basis for the title of Right Honorable,
this having been specially given to Sydney and
Melbourne in 1903, and to only six in all Britain.
As for precedence in a procession, that must follow
local rules; and the, S.A. local rule puts .the Mayor
behind every member of either Parliament and everv
knight; in fact, he follows the Commissioner of
Insolvency.
Adelaide has a Soldiers’ Cemetery on West-terrace,
and believes it to be the only one in Australia.
About 150 returned men are there already, and there
is room for 1000 more. The area has been beautified
by the ceremonious unveiling of a Cross of Sacrifice,
of Angaston marble with bronze facings.
11. Whitridge Davies, eldest son of our Prof. Harold
Davies, has been spending a year’s leave at the
Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New
York, and this month returns to his job of Research
Assistant in the Department of Therapeutics at
Edinburgh University. Davies saw war service with
the A.A.M.C., and was afterwards at Oxford with
Prof. J. S. Haldane.

Watches that Guard
the Fleeting Moment
SINCE the days of antiquity, man has
devised means to measure time.
The water clock of the ancients, the sun-
dial, the candle that King Alfred marked
into divisions, were all attempts to deal
with a difficult problem. 1 hey fade into
insignificance, however, when compared
with the modern timepiece.
Dependability is the chief feature of our
watches. They are made to measure
time with the greatest precision, yet to
withstand its ravages. Scientifically con-
structed, they are strong and handsome,
while at the prices shown their value is
without parallel.

Secrets of Beauty
The Cream of Modem Beauty Advice
By “MIMOSA.”
A PERSISTENTLY shiny nose or a dull,
lifeless complexion drives many a woman to
cosmetics and consequent despair, lliis is
easily remedied, as you need only to get from
your chemist a package of cleminite, and add
just sufiicient water to dissolve it. A little
of this simple lotion is Nature’s own beauti-
fier. It is very good for the skin, and in-
stantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powder-
ing entirely unnecessary, and absolutely
defies detection.
* * * *
COSMETICS can never really help a poor
complexion; often they are positively harm-
ful. The sensible, rational way is to actu-
ally remove the thin veil of stifling, half-
dead scarf skin from the face, and give the
fresh, vigorous and beautiful young skin
underneath a chance to show itself and to
breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way,
by merely applying mercolized wax at night,
like cold cream, and washing it off in the
morning. It absorbs the disfiguring cuticle
gradually and harmlessly, leaving a brilliant
natural complexion. Of course, this also
takes with it such facial blemishes as red
blotches, tan, moth patches, etc. As a freckle
remover and general complexion beautifier
this old-fashioned remedy is unequalled.
* * * *
BLACKHEADS, oily skins and enlarged
pores usually go together, but can be in-
stantly corrected by a unique new process.
A tablet of stymol is dropped in a tumbler
of hot water, which will then of course
“fizz” briskly. When the effervescence has
subsided the face is bathed with the stymol-
eharged water and then dried with a towel.
The offending blackheads, of their own
accord, come right off on the towel, the large
oily pores immediately contract and efface
themselves naturally. There is no squeezing,
forcing or any drastic action. The skin is
left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool. A few
such treatments should be taken at intervals
of three or four days thereafter in order
to ensure the permanence of the pleasing
result so quickly obtained. Stymol tablets
can be obtained from most up-to-date
chemists and stores.
» * # *
BEAUTIFUL hair adds immensely to the
personal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
look-out for any harmless thing that will
increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is.to use pure stallax as a
shampoo on account of the peculiarly glossy
fluffy and wavy effect which it leaves. A
teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax granules
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more than
sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair, apart
from its beautifying effect.
* * * *
IT is astonishing the number of women
who suffer from the humiliating affliction of
superfluous hair, and I am sorry to say
that through ignorance or wrong treatment
the majority of them have made matters con
siderably worse by causing the hairs to grow
more quickly and stronger than before. It
only requires a little thought to realise tli<
folly of it all. Removing the surface growth
for a few days may give temporary relief, but
in order to obtain permanent results the hair
roots must be killed. Apart from the elec
trie needle, which is a painful process, an}
chemist will tell you that the best home treat
ment is pure powdered pheminol, which has
a devitalising effect upon the liair roots, it
addition to which it removes all trace of the
objectionable hair in a few seconds, and the
recommended treatment gradually, but
surely, dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. Pure
powdered pheminol also will be found admir-
able for removing hair from the underarms,
a present-day custom much in vogue.

GLOVES
Hats arc beginning to rear a proud crest
again. After being cloche, potlike or snug
to the verge of shrieking monotony, they
have suddenly flung aside their humility, and
are now either lush growths of feathers or
mounds of flowers. Most of the season’s
best head-pieces found their way to Hand-
wick on Ladies’ Day, although—perhaps
because it was a fast day in Jewry—the mil-
linery was not such a Mosaic as it had been
earlier iii the meeting. The Governor’s
lady, whose hats are always interesting,
gladdened the vice-regal background with a
different composition each day. Her Wed-
nesday’s hat was a woodland effect of brown
and green, clouded over with feathery brown
fronds; the frock that went with it was
cunningly woven of finely-pleated georgettes
and beaded lace. Almost the same color
effects were chosen by Mrs. Colin Stephen,
who, with daughter Helen, was of the Gov-
ernment House party. The Harry Cliauvels
and the popular Hugh Main couple (she was
Joan Tregarthen) and the Wantabadgery
Macdonalds were others in the jolly-looking
group. Commodore Wardle, Lieutenant
Phillip and Captain Coote added male relief.
Premier Fuller’s wife and daughter were
consistent punters. Mother didn’t develop any
clothes thrills, but daughter Gwen more than
held her own in the glory of her raiment. A
Du Bavay girl from Melbourne wore some
pretty lightweight frocking with a rather
bored air; and Valerie Purves, from the same
cold South, was cuddled in ermine. Another
Melbourne visitor was Mrs. Nelken —her mil-
linery reminded one of Henley’s “My head
is bloody but unbowed.” Argie Mitchell
was one of the good-lookers. The Falkiner
clan came in force, and the Otway Falkiner
matron was turned out in smart olive-green
tailorings that ran to flash skunk boundaries.
Mrs. Monty Severn brought a priceless lace
scarf and a cameo; and among the most
striking young things were Vivian Manchee
in scarlet silk alpaca flecked with navy,
Margaret Osborne in black and white girdled
with geranium red, and that slip of loveli-
ness from Melbourne, the Wintcr-Irving
youngster. The Maoriland Lowrys, who
are making quite a social splash, and the
Greenwood couple, whose adored Gloaming
is now booked for the Cup, were other
notables; and Mrs. Floyd aired a Paris frock
of finely-pleated black georgette that carried
a love poem of Royal Egypt woven in Nile
greens and blues, with the red of desert
sands upon it.
If the short kilt is to stay in then large
hats must go out. This was q.e.d. at Satur-
day’s Randwiek meeting, when the hot day
tempted the wearing of one’s newest. The
nearly-knee skirt and the racecourse brim
present a comedy effect that is only height-
ened if the wearer’s face is of the tragic
or long variety. The vice-regal enclosure
presented gaping emptiness to the hungry
female eye, but the other stands radiated
gladness and plenty from clothes both neat
and gaudy. Barbara Knox was one of the
most effective large-hatters—she’s just the
right height. Judge Rolin’s wife, wiio never
misses a meeting, wore one of the new
neck-scarves in Persian blue; pianist
Muriel Fletcher turned on a nocturne in
black georgettes; a tall blonde stranger
got a AVhistler-like effect from smoky greys
and violets; Ruby Adams and Mrs. Beaton
were other best-frockers; and Stella George
did Neutral Bay proud in one of her just-
from-Paris outfits.
For sheer eye-sufficing beauty the perfect
blonde has the perfect brunette knocked out
in one round: Eve surely was a golden girl
and Lilith a brunette who. lacking the love-
Imess of Eve, sharpened her mental claws,
practised a few eye-vibrations and eurhyth-
mic ambulations, and had poor old man
at her mercy. The Vamp sisterhood, of
which she was forebear, has been doing like-
wise ever since. Which leads to the point
that the three outstanding good-lookers at
the Steeme Osborne-Matthew Robinson ball
were, among the youngsters, Joan Winter-
frvnig and Margaret Osborne; and. among
the matrons. Mrs. Vivers. All are slim, fair-
haired and blue-eyed, though the Melbourne
girl is a more radiant type than the Osborn?
cluck. This was the first society flutter in
a week punctuated by only two big private
dances; it was staged at the Rose Bay Golf
< lub, whose rooms were turned into a Spring
song with roses, lilac and primroses massed
with a patrician disregard for economy, or
in the manner of those whose credit at the
florist’s is so far good. Mrs. Osborne’s
old-rose draperies were appropriately caught
here, and there with gold wheat-ears; Mrs.
Robinson’s blue georgettes were freighted
with a cargo of beads, and daughter Kath-
leen was attractive in white chiffons. One
of the evening’s handsome frockers was Dr.
Verge’s wife, who trailed faintly blue drap-
eries ; and Mrs. Vivers wore pink coral
crusted with rhinestones.
The Ambassadors’ dinner-dance for the
Golden Fleece Kindergarten was the society
“charity’’ of Race Week. This kindergarten,
which is in Chippendale, is under the special
protection of the State’s Jasons; wherefore
a date was chosen to coincide with the
sheepgrowers’ invasion of the city. When
a somewhat delayed service had reached the
chicken stage, the saxophone and bones de-
cided to put a bit of jazz into the night, and
the dance was on. Mrs. Ernest Edols, who
was president of the committee, softened the
dignity of her office with rosy frock-
ing that blushed through an opalescent top-
dressing; pretty little Mrs. Chapman clothed
herself in lilac satins, while co-secretary Mrs.
Hardman wore handsome black trappings
with diamond flashlights in her hair. Charley
Morgan Jones kept tally on a straining
freight of balloons that threatened every
moment to float her up the stairs and out
oyer the roofs of Pitt-street. Her chief
aides were Audrey Maple-Brown and the
smiling Marjorie Luscombe-Newman. Mrs.
Jimmie Burns, who is growing wraith-like,
was a mediaeval tone-picture in brown and
green embossed lace; Mrs. Gordon, of
Werriwa, enfolded herself in jetty black-
ness ; Mrs. Tony Hordern brought Bettine
Brown, who was another wearer of lilac.
The Godbys and the Greenwoods celebrated
their triumphs, and Mrs. John McKelvey
was one of the evening’s belles.
That persistent speech-maker, Henry
Braddon, was M.C, for tire tea-drinking
arranged by the English-speaking Unionists
at the Astor the other afternoon. The guests
were the Keith Smith couple, and lie talked
aerial transport while she looked effective in
black frocking with a scarlet satin scarf
twisted round her throat after the manner
of D’Alvarez. American Consul Lawton’s
wife was another big chief, and a Miss Root,
from the States, fresh from visiting 19 cities
of China, spoke of a peace that passeth all
understanding when not only shall the lion
lie down with the lamb, but the twain shall
be as twins. Following this Walter Kirby
sang beatifically in French, and the Waley
lady’s pearls hobnobbed with a string of
the cultured variety, and Ruby Rich with
anguished eyes saw nearly 200 people press
in where there was seating room for only the
expected 100.
Here’s five-foot-odd of blue-eyed Australia
who has thought out a career for herself.
She is Alice Tregent, the one woman (and
she’s really
only a girl)
w h o makes
artificial eyes
in this conti-
nent. In her
room in Ful-
ler’s Building,
high above Eli-
zabeth - street,
theslim-handed
girl starts
where the ocu-
list has left
off, and meas-
ures, moulds
and colors the
artificial eye
till in outward
seeming it is
twin of its fel-
low. Alice is
one of a Vic-
torian soldier-
family, an d
looked after a job in the Base Records till
the return of a blinded Digger-brother gave
her another job—that of squiring him to
and from the Law School, where he was a
student. It was on these daily walks she
had her vision of the future: and now she
is trying to re 7 ise it, and putting a world
of sympathy into the effort. Our picture is
from May Moore.
The Loan Exhibition in the Feminist
Club arranged by Maud Fitzhardinge in the
interests of the Women’s College bell in the
University carillon has not been rushed. Be-
tween 3.30 and 4.45 on the second after-
noon the marble steps were trodden by two
genuine clients, three newspaper women, a
boy (to do the gas), Dr. Sinclair Gillies (to
cast an eye over a shelf of his own glazes)
and Municipal Librarian Bertie, who was
booked for a lecture on “The Romance of Old
Books.” On the first afternoon things went
better; Judge Hamilton, who had lent some
exquisite Chelsea and Wedgwood, declared
the hall of treasures open to quite two dozen
visitors, many of them owners of the pictures
on the walls. Among the latter were some
adorable Hilders and an immense number
of Japanese paintings, the property of Pro-
fessor Sadler. These Oriental pictures are
all long, narrow and unframed, kept firm by
end rods, and ornamented with narrow strips
of silk. There were embroideries, too, of
China and India, and some etched bits of
old Sydney sent along by the Royal Histori-
cal Society. But the piece that most captured
the fancy was a drab little sampler, worked
by one Ann Maria Tubb at the Advanced
age of 10. whereon Ann Maria not only
counted her blessings, but linked the names
of her benefactors —Providence and her
grandmother—with grateful humility. It
made one almost hope that Ann turned out
a real luiut, who, having married the vicar,
ran off with the squire, and finally deserted
him for a Spanish grandee with whom she
lived happily ever afterwards in a grove of
magnolias, with port wine to her breakfast
and champagne to her supper.
May Moore’s camera has caught Annis
Hoffe still with a dream in her eyes. It is
probably a
dream of
fairies and
children, for
Mrs. Ilofife’s

the secrets of
the kiddies’
world. H e r
vivid sketches
in the last
Society of
Artists’ show
attracted a
good deal of
attention, and
then the retir-
ing lady ad-
mitted that
she had done
a lot of illus-
trating for

stories in the
older countries.

Roses red and roses golden ; ermine and dia-
monds ; red carpets ; vice-regals; the Arch-
bishop in his amethystine robes; a tidal-wave
of enthusiasm rising from a sea of students
and music-lovers —that was the Town Hall
for both the farewell concerts of Dal Monte
and Borgioli. Toti, maybe a bit thinner,
was a curving smile in an ivory sheath gown
the first night, and she wore black and silver
brocade for her real good-bye. At the very
end of all, when the crowd refused to stir
without still another encore, and Toti and
Borgioli had prettily responded by his play-
ing to her singing of one of his own composi-
tions, Lady de Chair sent up her own bouquet
of red roses to Toti.
The vice-regals got away from the mad-
ding throng one day during the week and
took their house-party and a handful of
friends for a launch picnic up Middle Har-
bor. They went in the Premier, tucked
themselves around a headland out of the
wind, and made a day of it.
The Baroness Maria Antoinette Avanzo,
who is out to raise £5OO for St. Margaret’s
babies, claims to be one of the State’s suc-
cessful women-farmers. She runs her own
little place at Quaker’s Hill, beyond Parra-
matta, having decided on a truly rural life
after a drop of a thousand feet (or was it
miles?) from an aeroplane in Italy had
made her native heath distasteful to her.
The doctor ordered change in every way;
hence Australia gets a charming settler with
two children. The lady is the proprietor
of a woman’s paper in Milan, and has some-
thing of a reputation as a motorist. After
the cabaret at the Wentworth, which opens
her money-raising plan, and at which she
has promised to produce a real live prince
as a performer (his name is Del Drago),
she is going to look for another woman-
motorist to race her to Melbourne. Quaker’s
Hill seems an appropriate spot for the rest-
Kiss lady to have pitched her camp.
Smiled her last good-bye at Scone a week
or so ago, Mrs. Elizabeth Ferguson, one of
the oldest and most widely-loved residents
of the Upper Hunter. A member of one of
the Hawkesbury pioneering families, she
hrst saw the light 90 years ago at Wilber-
torce, where her mother had been born more
than a quarter of a century earlier. Of her
two sons one is concerned with shipping and
oil-wells m California; the other is that
Judge of the Supreme Court in Sydney for
whom a very wide circle of friends and
admirers are feeling sympathy.
Dr. Adrian Verbrugglien, eldest son of the
former Director of the Con., looks like set-
tling in Australia. Last week he married
pretty Jean Ross Campbell, of Armidale
Adrian’s practice is at Guyra.
At the. end of this month the Royal Aus-
tralian Naval College will have its first
wedding. The bride will be Phyllis Wheat-
ley and the groom Roy Sadlier, who both
took up their residence at Jervis Bay at the
beginning of 1915 when the College opened,
she as the youngest daughter of Headmaster
.; . . '' • M heatley, he as a young cadet
,^ n 1916 the young lieutenant
passed out of. the College and spent the next
thiee years m the North Sea, serving in
H.M.A.S. Australia and in submarines. He
brought J 4 to Australia, and was attached
to her until the submarines were scrapped.
An appointment at the Naval College then
sealed his fate. Roy's father formerly lived
in Perth, but is now holding the hands of suc-
ceeding Agents-General for W.A. in London.
Commodore Wardle will soon have a young
hostess for his naval parties. His just-out
daughter is due in Sydney at the end of
the year. She’s reported pretty, a keen
motorist and handy with a golf-club.
Maorilander Mary MacCormick (she’s a
daughter of Judge MacCormick of Auck-
land) gave her second Sydney recital in the
Con. mid-way through last week. Mary is
an attractive girl with an engaging smile
and a mezzo-soprano that makes her audience
clap like thunder. The programme was in-
teresting and included works by Rachmani-
noff, Cyril Scott, Strauss, Brahms. The
front seats werfc inlaid with friends and
admirers, many of them Maorilanders over
for the races. The Grammar School Dett-
mans brought a large party, and the floral
offerings might have won a coo of approval
from a grand-opera prima donna.
A Sydney woman meets old friends:—
hast night I dined with comedian George Robey
and his wife. Mrs. Robey was one of Melbourne's
prettiest girls and an accomplished light-opera artist.
Iler father was Thomas Haydon, secretary of the
Victoria Club. Their eldest son, who is named
Melbourne, has had a brilliant course at Cambridge,
and is to be sponsored at the English Bar by Sir
Marshall Hall. I went to Chaliapine’s Albert Hall
concert, and found the Russian bass superb. Melba's
sisters Annie (Mrs. Box) and Dora (Mrs. Lempriere)
were there, both looking very elegant. Two other
Aussies, ...inna Fischer and her husband, George
Clutsam, are on the crest of the wave. George is
following his “Lilac Time” success with a new musical
play, both lyrics and music, on the life-story of
Chopin. William Boosey and Robert Courtneidge
think it finer than “Lilac Time.” Minna’s son
Leonard, the child of her first marriage (with the
popular Herbert Flemming), is a farmer in South
Africa, andi writes as a sideline. ITis recent book,
“The Call of the Veldt,” received splendid reviews
in London. Another visitor to London was Frances
Saville, whose home is at Cap Martin. She is
launching brother Will Simonsen’s daughter as a
violinist.
_ The Royal Sydney Yacht Club at Kirri-
billi has a neighboring Royalty to dip its
burgee to. It is the Prince Edward Club, on
Point Piper, and surgeon MacCormick is the
commodore. Everything about the new club
whispers wealth; and the ladies have insinu-
ated themselves within its portals. Only as
associate members, certainly; but still
Brisbane’s budget:—
Sir Matthew made a revolutionary proposal at
Charleville the other day, when he told Mrs. Cocky
and her daughters that women should join men’s
organisations instead of forming separate ones in
which sex distinction puts them at a disadvantage.
The mere men in the audience had terrible visions
of the white-anting of their clubs by female re-
formers with an instinctive jealousy of such rivals
to the home as cards and whisky. Later his Ex.
listened to Arnold Weinholt’s lecture on Primitive
Man as a Hunter, at the Royal Geographical; and
that supplied him with another point of view.
The skipper of the Ville de Verdun, on his first
visit to the port o’ Brisbane, dined a party aboard
the boat, including the Theodores, the Consul-General
for France, the Nixon-Smiths and Miss Needham
Walker, the Carters, Hillcoats and Major Joss.
The Arts and Crafts show, opened by Sir Matthew,
attracted with some charming wood-carving, delicate
pottery, and a screen whereon little folk disported.
Mrs. Moran sponsored a very tempting exhibit of
enamel-work jewellery.
The Geoffrey Archbutts (she is the recent Cadell
Garrick bride) went through Brisbane this week,
bound for Hong Kong, by the Eastern.
Mrs. Ted Theodore invited some 60 to meet
Pamela Nathan in Lennon’s new ballroom. The
AVinter Garden was decorated with white lilies and
pink and white larkspur. Sir Matthew and the
George Nathans were present. Mrs. Theodore wore
black satin with steel embroideries, and at her black
wristlet band dangled a white posy. Pamela was in
delphinium blue, shrouded in gold lace, with ostrich-
feather trimmings. Nellie Dowd sang between dances,
and officers of the Themistocles were among the
jazzers.
Mrs. Blackman and Mrs. John Jardine arranged a
party at Lennon’s for Madge Blackman, who is soon
to marry T. Jardine, of Stanthorpe. Airs. Blackman
wore black-and-white silk milan, and the bride-elect
was in cinnamon and cream georgette. The Cowley
and Philp dames were among the guests.
The Anzac Club launched its appeal in the South
Brisbane City Hall amid ropes of greenery and gay
gerberas. Gwen Foote danced in Oriental garb, while
\A r ynne Macoboy and Brian Lawrence gave a musical
programme, and Mayoress Keogh received the guests.
The Hawaiian Troubadours are opening up the
grimly-closed Theatre Royal again, and will be fol-
lowed by a real live melodrama. His Majesty’s
gets “Good Morning, Dearie!” as a change from melo-
drama shortly. In the meantime Phil Smith is put-
ting on brisk musical comedy at the Empire.
Sir Matthew was at Ascot for Guineas’ Day, with
the George Nathans and Mrs. Turner. His Ex. gave a
tea party to the Glyn Connollys, the Glencoe Mac-
kenzies, E. K. Tullys, Elfrida Walsh, Beryl Collins,
Miss O’Shea, Keyser Barnes and B. Bell. Mrs.
Nathan wore grey, with touches of Egyptian red,
Mrs. Leonard Turner black and grey, Miss O’Shea
cinnamon brown, and Mrs. Beath mauve georgette.

MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Caulfield was uncomfortably crowded on
Saturday, although the weather was showery and
the course sloppy. The going agreed with Heroic,
who left the barrier more smartly than he did in
the A.J.C. Derby, was second to Sir Dighlock at
the turn, and ran home an easv winner by three
lengths from Versine, who looked dangerous at the
distance. The fiery chestnut was 2 to 1 on early,
but receded to 6to 4 on at the finish. He left the
mile behind in Imin. 45see. Spearfelt began slowly,
but was finishing well in fourth place. There was
a fair amount of money for Sir Dighlock at B’s
(on his Sydney running it should have been 20’s
at least), but Versine, who has grown into a nice
filly, was friendless at 25’s.
The Caulfield Stakes produced a great race between
The Hawk (7’s) and Whittier (evens), and the
Maorilander, ridden in Pike’s best style, was half
a head to the good when they arrived in line with
the judge. He had run past the little IVoorak hor'-e
at the half-distance, but Whittier responded gamely
when Dempsey applied pressure. All Sunshine was
third, many lengths behind the pair, and Frances
Tressady was a fast-finishing fourth, while Harvest
King, who has since gone wrong, Easingwold, Wal-
larak, Bold and Bad, and the' Governor’s horse, The
Night Patrol, who showed pace till his condition gave
out, followed them home. Wallarak’s seventh was
very impressive, seeing that he carried Bst. 111 b—
. more than his Caulfield Cup weight—and
finished ahead of a good mare like Wynette.
The Guineas and the Stakes were the only two
flat races in which punters fared at all resnectablv.
Dcmades (25’s) gave them a, shock by making every
post a winner in the 1010 Welter, and Paravane
(another 25-to-l chance) added to their misery by
downing the hot favorite, Manacre, in the Debutant
Stakes. Manacre might have won had he left the
harrier with the others, but he was two lengths
behind the Thrice—Kuningada gelding at the judge’s
box. Paravane carried a 101 b. penalty for his
success in the Fulham Park Stakes. And five horses
were better backed than Soorak (10’s) in the
Toorak Handicap. Hitherto the Sydney-owned and
Bendigo-trained son of Woorak—So and So has been re-
carded in the jockeys’ room as a tougli proposition,
hut he behaved quite docilely for his old pilot,
Pike. Beeline (6’s) was a good second, and Brim-
ming, the favorite, Anton Rain, Spearage and Llan-
thony were close up. Soorak comes down a stone,
to Bst. 31b., in the Caulfield Cup.
Suomi is favorite for the Caulfield Cup, and,
barring accidents, he will retain his position in the
market. At the Heath, on October 4, he beat some
of the best handicap horses in Victoria, and did it
so convincingly that his name has been at the
head of the charts ever since. At the rear of the
field for five furlongs, he moved up rounding the
turn, and came to light with such a remarkable run
that he caught and passed the sometime w.f.a. hero
Stare, witli Easingwold, Soorak, San Antonio, All
Sunshine, Graculus and other fancied hopes for the
12 furlongs lengths away. Suomi will meet most
of that lot on worse terms in the six-thousand-
pounder, but it is hard to imagine any of them
reversing the positions. Ashley Reed rides him at
7st. 101 b. If anything downs Suomi it may be Wal-
larak, who is very lightly weighted for a Woorak
four-year-old that won three times in succession
before his good gallop in the Caulfield Stakes.
The A.J.C. Spring meeting saw the end,
as racehorses, of Rivoli, who didn’t reappear after
his indifferent performance on the first day and is
to be retired to the stud, and Ballymena, whose fate
was sad. On tha strength of an excellent second fo
Gloaming in the Craven Plate, Ballymena was made
an odd.s-on favorite for the Randwick Plate, in which
he had only David (looking rather weary after his
Metrop. race), the unready Tomatin and the hurdler
Les Paddington to beat. After one of the two
miles had been traversed the Nassau gelding was
taken to the front, but when approaching the home
turn with what looked like a winning lead, he sud-
denly swerved and was pulled up, leaving David to
gallop home at his ease. The unfortunate favorite
had broken a leg, and was a distressing sight as
he reared up in his agony. He was mercifully
destroyed.
It was David’s twentieth victory, and he has
now earned £31,024 in stake-money, being third
in that respect to Gloaming ( £39,517) and Eury-
thmic (£36,891), and ahead of Carbine ( £29,626),
Cetigne (£27,206) and Poitrel (£26,920). He has
covered more ground than any horse of his time,
and although he was lucky on Saturday, it was
really a wonderful performance for a stallion in
his eighth year to run a close second in the Metro-
politan with 9st. 81b., conceding 321 b to a smart
handicap horse like Polyoletan. It is his good old
Australian blood that tells. Gloaming, his nine
years and 51 wins notwithstanding, has really had
a less arduous time than David, for he has rarely
raced beyend a mile and a quarter, and many of his
starts have been in sprints. This page remains
of the opinion that he is not quite as good _as
he was, and expects this to be made manifest during
his visit to Melbourne. All the same, he has been
a great horse and a faithful slave to amiable old
G. I). Greenwood, who headed the list of Winning
owners at the meeting with a total of £8221, to
which Gloaming contributed £4046, Nincompoop
(Breeders’ Plate) £2170, and Chignon (Gimerack
Stakes) £2005. It is an extraordinary thing that
the best colt and the best filly among the two-year-
olds should have come from one stable, and not a
very large stable at that. But R. J. Mason is in a
class of his own as a judge and trainer of thorough-
breds.
Nigger Minstrel failed badly in the Craven Plate,
in which David —-never a ten-furlong horse —beat
him for third money, and apparently he is not as
good as the Maori!anders thought. Either that or
the Derby race was enough for him on the interrupted
preparation he got. Apart from the place-getters in
the Derby, the three-year-olds are not much chop.
Meenah, who won the Clibborn Stakes for Miss Una
Clift, is fairly smart, but she had disappointed the
stable on Monday and it didn’t have a shilling on
her on Saturday. Strongbow also won unbacked,
and shaped miserably when well in the market;
both are chestnuts by imported Bowman. Outside
the w.f.a. division the best horses at the meeting
were The Monk (Suburban Handicap), Purser (Sydney
Handicap), and Virgin Gold (Final Handicap). The
last-named English horse, for whom Pat. Osborne
gave 3000 guineas, made hacks of a decent field after
getting away badly and running last for a few
furlongs, and will probably be racing in w.f.a.
company presently. The Monk ran a very gallant
race with lOst. 71b. on his back, and spoilt a big
commission for Rahiri, who had 291 b. less. But
Purser’s victory might have been followed by an
inquiry. In the l}-mile Spring Stakes, run in
2min. 37see., he finished behind El Dorado and
Tomatin. The only horse he beat to the box was
Highlander, who had a mere 31b. the better of the
weights, whereas in a handicap he would have received
another 301 b. at least. But, carrying 9st. 81b. in
a handicap over the same distance four days later,
the horse that couldn’t head Tomatin or El Dorado
at w.f.a. won like a champion from Comptroller (6st.
101 b.) and The Lance (7st. 71b.) and a strung-out
field in 2min. 32£sec.; and the stable collected a
parcel at from s’s‘to 3’s. Strange that no questions
were asked. The Sydney Handicap was one of
MeShortodds’s bad races, but there weren’t many.
Mac. must have shown a tidy profit on the meeting.

“Westerner” : In the days when unregis-
tered meetings were held at Bicton (W.A.). a horse
coal black in color was backed like a certainty and
won in a canter. The
steed was fast, but his
color wasn’t; it hap-
pened to be a hot day,
and the dye sweated
off in patches, so that
the “black” horse was
a piebald when he
passed the post. The
stewards had him
scrubbed down, and he
turned out to be a
chestnut. The horse of
many colors was a
“ringtail” under a
term of disqualification.
The stewards made it
“life.”
DAN LEWIS ,
trainer of Poly-
cletan and other
good winners.
King s School was victorious in the
G.P.S. sports on the Sydney Cricket Ground—its
fourth success in 33 years. R. M. Moore, a very
likely-looking sprinter, helped to put it in the
l ea d by winning the 100yds. in 10 3-10 sec. and the
220 in 22 .4-ssee. Another outstanding performer
vvas C. S. Stuart of “Shore,” who got away with
the 440yds. in 52 4-ssec., and the 880 in 2min.
2 4-ssec. In the under-16 division, J. Coulton, of
St. Joseph’s, annexed the 100yds. in 10 3-ssec., and
the 220 in 23 4-ssec. These are very good times
for a youngster, but in the under-16 100 yards,
conducted on the Brisbane Exhibition Ground last
month by the Queensland Secondary Schools Associa-
tion, G. B. Myles, a Toowoomba Grammar School
hoy, won in 10 l-10sec. Second to Myles was W. S.
Dods, of the Brisbane Boys’ College, who collected
the 220 in 22 9-10 sec. If the times were correct!''
taken, these kids are champions in the making.
Past Grammar : Many of Sydney Uni-
versity’s finest athletes 1 in the past have come south
from Brisbane Grammar School, and even now Bris-
bane Uni. doesn’t mop up all the available talent.
One of the most versatile young athletes from the
Northern State is F. R. Boyce, who repr&ented his
school at cricket, football, rowing, swimming, rifle
shooting and gymnastics and is now something of
a in Sydney University cricket. Boyce’s most
striking performance as a schoolboy was the winning
of Brisbane golf club championship in 1915-16-17.
In 1920 he was runner up to E. L. Apperley for the
N.S.W. championship, winning the Queensland cham-
pionship once more in 1920-21 and the N.S.W. four-
somes in the latter year, with H. W. McLelland as
partner.
ALEC RUSSELL, Australian open golf
champion.
The Warrnambool-Melbourne road race
produced a new world’s record for 100 miles, Jack
Watson, of Malvern, covering the distance in 4hr.
18min. 9 _ 2-ssec. But Watson, who started from
scratch, did not finish among the first 20, who were
mostlv men with liberal handicaps. The winner was
a 19 year-old Werribee boy, W. F. King (64min.),
who, with his father, W. A. King (62min.), led
the procession past most of the official points. His
old man, a top-note her of a score of years ago,
was fourth; and Charlie Snell (58min.), riding a
plucky race after a nasty spill at Colac, finished
second. IT. Opperman received the prize for fastest
time, 7 hours 15min. 37sec. The amateur race
from Colac to Melbourne went to H. Thomas, of
Liverpool (N.S.W.), who, like Opperman, distin-
guished himself over the Goulburn-Sydney course
last month.
* * * *
“The Deacon”: Bill Howell, who is to have
a benefit match on the Sydney Cricket Ground this
week, N.S.W. v. an Australian XI, is a native of
the Nepean district, N.S.W. Bill learned his early
cricket under difficulties, travelling from Penrith to
Sydney on Saturdays, in the intervals of cockying,
and playing on the Domain for the Warwicks. He
arrived late in first-class cricket, and was past his
athletic prime when he went to England in 1899 and
made history in his first match by taking the
whole 10 Surrey wickets for 28. A poet of the
day embalmed him in some topical verse as a
bee-farmer, and the implication stuck, though Bill
is better known in his home suburb of Castlereagh
as a grower of pumpkins and water-melons. A life-
long teetotaller, Bill silently suffers the affliction of
rheumatism, which reduces him to going on all
fours periodically, and interferes with shire cricket
activities and the training of an odd trotter —Leg
Break was the best he ever owned in that direction.
A daughter shows considerable promise as a tennis
player. A tireless bowler and a mighty swiper
when in the mood, old Bill deserves well of the
Sydney public, and the game could do with a few
like him to-day.
John Murray, of the S.A. contingent in the
Howell benefit match, belongs to the big squatting
family of that name, and is a nephew of the Chief
Justice. He made a sparkling 50-odd in his first
game for the State in 1912, but afterwards went to
the Agricultural College at Roseworthv and was lost
to big cricket. After the war, Murray did fairly
well in the A.I.F. team in England, and latterly
he has been batting better than ever. He fairly
won the club premiership in Adelaide for East
Torrens last season with a score of over 200; and
his only two innings this season have been 51 and
79, both not out.
“Wink”; The excuse given by the Vic. Cricket
Association for preventing Victorians from taking
part in the Howell benefit match was that Melbourne
players with a chance of international honors did not
want to apoear before the selectors so early in the
season. This is all bunkum. The fact is that the
Association was nettled because it wasn’t let into
the secret of the Howell match until N. S. Wales had
completed the arrangements. It complains, too, that
Sydney gets more than her fair share of cricket
banquets. The idea of Ponsford, Woodfull, Liddi-
cutt and Wallace being afraid to play in Sydney
so early in the piece is, of course, absurd. On the
off ehanee of such a match as this they have been
practising for months, and are already in fine form.
All the winter Liddi. was swinging a heavy mallet
round and round in his tours of the fire-brigade
office, and he has been a constant attendant at
Woodfull’s private pitch. And Wallace sports an
illuminated eye showing where a ball rebounded
from a brick wall while he was at back-yard
practice. Mayne, Hartkopf, Ryder and other vete-
rans may not be in form yet, but to prevent the
eager colts from gaining honor and exnerience, and
from assisting Howell, is neither good policy nor good
cricket.
Edgar Mayne’s friends had hopes that Ik
might be appointed to captain the Australian XI li-
the first Test match, but when the Board of Control
discussed the matter in Sydney last week its choice
fell on the phlegmatic Collins, who will have the
assistance of E. E. Bean and Clem Hill in choosing
the team. The Board fixed the customary honor-
arium at £3O a match, with an additional £1 a
day for expenses when the player is away from hie
State. These amounts will be supplemented by flic
proprietors of Wolfe’s Schnapps, who have under-
taken to pay the Aussies' 2s. for every boundary hit.
£1 for every smite over the pickets, the same
for every catch, £lO for each century compiled
within 21 hours, and £25 for the best bowling
average, the winner to have played in at least three
matches and taken 10 wickets. So diligent young
men in flannels may make quite a lot of money this
year.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp”: Melbourne has a family
cricket club which has been going since 1908 -the
McConehies. Descendants of David and Janet lb-
Conchie, settlers in 1871, they have never had any
difficulty in sustaining an eleven, and they generally
finish well up in the competitions —they played in
Metropolitan League during the last couple of seasons
and in the Southern Cross Association before that.
Eight of the original team of 1908 are still active,
and one of them, Owen McConchie, is reckoned to
have been good enough for inter-State honors ii
the family club had not held him; in 16 years of
club cricket lul holds a batting average of 39. On
one occasion the clan staged a married y. single
match on its own account ; on another, it journeyed
to Geelong to beat the Rankin family, and 76 Mc-
Conchies made the trip. One of its best batsmen,
Angus, was killed in France.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The N. S. Wales selectors
are very wisely giving some of the Sydney school-
boys a chance to practise foil the inter-State games.
Though it is a commonplace in England for boys in
the public-school elevens to play county cricket in
the summer holidays, few of our G.P.S. cracks have
had much recognition in the trials since Johnny
Taylor was a boy. Now T. Egan, of King's School,
a remarkably promising slow’ bowler (M. A. Noble
is loud in his praise), and A. Salmon, a 1 brilliant
batsman from “Shore,” have been asked to join
the 24 selected for special practice at the S.C.G.
J. Foskett, a Moore Park batsman who made good
with Glebe last season, is another selection, with
L. Gwynne, of Manly (chosen for the “Australian
XI” in the Howell benefit match), and 11. O. Rock, i f
’Varsity.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Cabled that little Bobby
Abel, for .years the darling of the Kennington Oval
gods, is going blind, and that a fund has been opened
for his assistance. Small and of poor physique, Abel
was, in his way, one of the curiosities of cricket.
The story goes that he originally came into notice ns
a bowler, but taught himself to bat by sheer
application, till, in his prime, he was one of the
best professional bats in England. Beginning with
Surrey in the days of Shuter and W. W. Read, Bobby
outlasted many of his contemporaries. lie was no
great stylist, and was reputedly afraid of fast bowling,
yet he made plrnty of runs season after season, and
that against high-class fast bowlers like Brearley,
lvortright, Mold. Hirst, Ernest Jones and many an-
other. His 19 Test-match innings against Australia
averaged a point under 31 runs; and his best score
was 132 n. 0., made at Sydney on his only visit to
Australia with Lord Sheffield’s team in 1892. Ilis
last appearance in a Test w r as at Manchester in
1902, when Australia won by 3 runs.
* » * *
“Iffley”: “J.H.” (Lond.) alleges cliqueism
and prejudice among “the gentry who rule the roost
at Oxford” exercised to the detriment of Australian
footballers. My ow’n experience of Oxford is that
any athlete coming with a reputation from overseas,
whatever branch of sport he might excel in, had just
as good a chance of getting his blue as the home-
grown product, sometimes even a better one. I am
convinced that there are many Australians competent
to speak on the subject who will readily endorse
this, and that the records, rich in the tally of over-
seas blues, give it overwhelming confirmation. One
Oxford Rugby team, not so many years since, con-
tained no less than six South African Rhodes scholars.
This year’s Cambridge cricket captain was a Maori-
lander (Lowry) ; last vear an Australian (Bettington)
led the Oxford XI. Then “J.H.,” whose insinuations
certainly don’t make for good feeling in sport, must
needs go on to charge the M.C.C. with snobbery
for overlooking Fender when it picked the present
team of cricketers for Australia, because, according to
him, “he only went to St. Paul’s, and not to Eton,
Harrow, Oxford or Cambridge.” Isn’t it more likely
that Fender was left out because during the last
tour he managed to ahtagonise the Australian
barracker and many of the press critiis for reasons
quite unconnected with his cricket? Douglas, like
Fender, was not at one of the great English public
schools or at either ’Varsity, yet the M.C.C. never
showed any hesitation about selecting him to lead
England when he was at his best.

“Past Grammar”: N.S.W. Rugby Union
has elected Dr. lien Brown and Johnnie Wallace to
represent it at the world’s Rugby conference to be
held in London in December. Wallace is the ex-
Sydney Uni. and N.S.W. three-quarter who plays for
Oxford and Scotland. A Rhodes scholar likewise,
Brown went to Oxford from Queensland, where 1-e
won his first rep. cap against Bedell Sivright’s team
in 1908. At Oxford and in the Blackheath ano
England sides for several seasons lie earned the
reputation of being one of the finest forwards of
his time. He has long been the Australian delegate
to the English Rugby Union, and has been a father
to Australian footballers visiting Britain.

“Schnorrer”: Some time ago reference was
made in The Bulletin to the Hakoali footballers
a team of Vienna Jews, who administered a shock,
to a touring British Soccer side. Subsequently the
Hakoahim descended on Britain and inflicted a smash-
ing defeat on a crack club; and since that time
(no doubt because life in Austria is very hard) they
have toured many countries and have been victorious
everywhere. Thev have been invited to visit Souk’
Africa next year; and if that trip takes place an
effort may be made to bring the combination to
Sydnev. A match in which a whole side could he
distinguished by its noses as well as its gueinsejs
would be rather thrilling.
THE PERSPIRING GREEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dr. Harvey Sutton, in his Health Week address
at tile Sydney Commercial Travellers’ Club, com-
mended the practice of the ancient Greeks, who made
it a rule to exercise to sweat point once a day, and
were consequently able to bear arms up to 60 years
of age.”
The men who fought at Salamis were tough as
tough could be,
And likewise they who combed their hair before
Thermopylae.
In sudorific exercise they found the only right
Specific that could make and keep them fiddle-fit
for fight.
They hurled the discus and indulged in other strenu-
ous games
Till perspiration rolled in streams adown their virile
frames.
Nor shearers’ cooks, nor Randwick books that odds
in summer lay
Can ever lard the dusty earth as merrily as they.
The modern Hellene finds his lines in spheres more
peaceful set
But still he specialises in the faculty of sweat.
And though the grandeur that was Greece a memory
has become
lie has the steak-and-oyster joint for a gymnasium.
He rips the bivalve shells apart, he tears in twain the
cray,
As substitute for sword and shield he grips the
loaded tray;
And by the unobstructed pores their mission that
fulfil
To such salubrious effect, you know him Hellene
still.
Eclipsed may he the sun of fame that once on
Athens shone,
The Spartan virtues obsolete, the Pyrrhic phalanx
gone ;
V ithal, if vigor is ensured by a diurnal sweat,
I look to see Demetrius got home on Abdul yet.

APPLICATIONS arc invited for the posi-

Applications close on 15th November, 1924,

lars may be obtained.

5 45-49 Steamship Buildings,
Carrie Street- Adelaide, S.A.
THE INKY WAY.
T. T. Opie, who died the other day at Parkside
(S.A.), aged 70, was for many years on the reading
staff of the Advertiser, and at one time published
the Weekly Herald. His only son is T. S. Opie,
Dip. Ec., who recently went to England to gain
further knowledge of economics.
“0.P.”: When “Birthstains” Beauchamp, who has
just been elected Liberal leader in the Lords in place
of Viscount Grey, was Governor of N. S. Wales, be
had a double in Vic. in Alf. Lumsden, then a
leading light of the A.N.A. and an amateur con-
jurer. If Beauchamp had wanted a day off he could
have safely handed his cocked hat to Lumsden. The
Victorian has changed a good deal since, and now
runs a weekly paper at Kew. He got within 11
votes of Speaker Frank Madden at one Assembly
election for Boroondara.
Tom Turin eel iffe, Victoria’s Chief Secretary, was
a freelance in his youthful days, when his politics
were as red as The Bulletin’s cover. He wrote
fiery articles and poems for the Tocsin under the
pen-name of “Camille”—an allusion, not to the
erotic lady of the camellias, but to the French
revolutionist who was sent to the guillotine by
Robespierre. With increase of years and girth has
come increase of wisdom, and Tom’s politics are
now pale pink, with a slight tinge of green. He
still writes voluminously, but no longer signs himself
“Camille.”
R. S. Ross, a frequent contributor to The Bul-
letin, has edited more papers in his time than most
pressmen. The Maoriland Worker, Barrier Truth,
Industrial Worker, the Socialist and Ross’s
Magazine are a few of them. His latest
venture id the Union Voice, which incorporates the
Socialist and Ross’s. Incidentally, he found time
to write a readable history of the Eureka Stockade.
Ross made his start on tlife sporting press, which,
queerly enough, has been the nursery of many
radical journalists—very few of them, however, as
thoughtful and generous in their judgments as he is.
“Abbot Park”: Old files of the Port Phillip
Gazette and of the Melbourne Morning Herald
show some curious advts. A Bourke-street hotel of
1847 set forth its attractions in verse:—
“Here may the weary bushman rest from toil,
Nor fear a lurking demon in his glass ;
No greedy sharpers, eager for the spoil
Of honest labor, through these portals pass.”
Johnny Fawkner, the father of the Melbourne press,
was then living in Flinders-lane, and offered for sale
a variety of fruit-trees and shrubs.
“Mel”: The deadhead list has grown so enormously
in these days of newspaper stunts and illustrated jour-
nalism that it is a wonder theatrical managers aren’t
beginning to buck. The other night, at a Melbourne
theatre, the writer (himself a deadhead) counted 12
men from one paper. It is on record that at one Mel-
bourne Cup meeting the group of papers puulished
from one office was issued 72 press tickets, and at this
year’s Show “pressmen” for whom free tickets were
required were found to include (besides reporters,
photographers and cartoonists), photographer's’ assist-
ants, chauffeurs, laddermen (whatever they may be),
copy-boys and messengers. In their own interests
journalists will have to take a hand in this matter.
“Abbot P.”: The search for the two white women
allegedly captured and held by Arnheim Land abo-
rigines recalls the stir made in 184 G-47 over the
supposed survivor of a wreck on the Gippsland coast,
and the difficulty of convincing many people that
the yarn was a figment. Three books came into
being over the affair. Robert Russell, Government
surveyor for Port Phillip, wrote “The Heart” in 1849 ;
Henry Gyles Turner published (anonymously) in
1857 “The Captive of Gippsland” ; and as late as the
’seventies a third author touched on the subject in
reminiscence form. Each seemed to be unwilling
to give up the illusion, notwithstanding that it
had been completely demolished.
“Cliarlik”: .Julius M. Price, the war artist, recently-
deceased —he scampered about the W.A. goldfields
and wrote a book on them in 1895 —was responsible
for the panels which adorn the inner walls of
the Eccentric Club, London. These paintings, about
half life-size, illustrate the adventures of an “Eccen-
tric in Paradise.” Arthur Roberts, in evening dress
and “Captain Coddington” tall hat, has the title
role, the attendant figures being undraped houri%
who regale Roberts with champagne, cigars, etc.
There is nothing objectionable about these frolick-
ing females. They are frankly out for a lark, and
Roberts appears to be having the time of his life.
The contrast between classic and' “Coddington” is
very quaint. Much disappointment used to be ex-
pressed at the veiling of these pictures on “Ladies’ ”
nights.
“G.R.”: Although it is generally believed that
an American publication holds the record, it seems
that the world’s greatest net sale belongs to the
News op the World, a London Sunday paper, which
claims to have a circulation of 3,000,000. The
Sunday Pictorial, also of London, claims 2,362,769.
Others in that rank are Saturday Evening Post,
2,356,334; Pictorial Review, 2,256,217; American
Magazine, 2,021,769. Then come Ladies’ Home
Journal, 1,999,266 ; Daily Mail (London), 1,817,947 ;
Woman’s Home Companion, 1,810,606; McCall’s
Magazine, 1,676,964; Manchester Empire News,
1,381,902 ; Literary Digest, 1,353,384 ; Cosmopoli-
tan. 1,101,160; Illustrated Sunday Herald,
1,047,712; Daily Mirror, 1,024,869; Delineator,
1,025,263; and Collier’s, 1,002,101. An inch of
advertising space in the News of the World costs
2305. ; and London Punch, which is passed from
hand to hand like The Bulletin, commands £4 an
inch.
“Inkpen”: American and Brit'sh newspapers are
already beginning to sit up and take notice of radio,
the possibilities of which from a “news” point of
view cannot yet be fully gauged. In the U.S.A.
radio is already accepted as being not only in the
“news business'” but also in the “publicity line.”
Space in air is sold for advertising purposes, at the
rate of two dollars for 10 minutes; but it is not
just plain, crude stuff. Everything “put on the air”
is carefully edited to eliminate features the radio
public would resent. No direct advertising is done.
Prices or names of firms are not carried in connection
with an article mentioned. The general form is to
announce that the next item on the programme is
bv courtesv of the Blank Company, and then the
carefully prepared “copy” is sent out. Copv can be
broadcasted in the morning for half the evening
charge, and a discount of 10 per cent, is allowed for
a series of 10 talks or more. One firm engaged in
the business says that the past year’s experience has
proved radio to be a splendid “goodwill” medium,
and 250 firms used radio advertising last year. As
regards the news items, sports contests, speeches
and other events form the mainstay of the daily
programme, with the usual crop, weather and money
reports. Already within the metropolitan _ a-nea of
New York there are 750,000 receiving sets with three
listeners to each set, making a total of well over
two millions.
PLAIN PAPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Never accuse me of things feminine—
Frilled frocks and lacy iiats and parasols!
There was a time I loved these —being' nine;
But it is long now since 1 played with dolls.
This plain white paper matches more my soul
Than scented stuffs of pink and cream and blue.
My little thoughts 1 faithfully unroll.
Sun-clear, earth-sure, sea-clean and woman-true.
Color? The sky, the grass made my eyes fair.
No flower is like my face—nor red, nor white.
I have seen dull brown plains look like my hair.
Stars do not seek it in the secret night.
Just as the lines run here —-now white, now black,
Straight, cold, indifferent to tide and time —
So, unadorned with broidery, I pack
My plain, self plainly in my plain, still rhyme.

Grand-opera stars Toti dal Monte and
Dino Borgioli finished up their Sydney sea-
son in a triumph. Their two concerts at
the Town Hall were packed to suffocation
point, although the second was on
Monday, the worst showman’s-night of
the week. Of the two singers the
tenor proved himself the more con-
summate artist; and though, of course,
his voice is not a world-beater in quality,
there were moments of honeyed sweetness in
the middle-voice passages, and superb sing-
ing, as in “Una Furtiva Lagrima,” from
Donizetti’s “Elisir d’Amore.” A surf-like
roar of applause followed this, and a demon-
stration as loud and prolonged was evoked
by the “Mignon” Romance. On Monday
right Borgioli’s greatest moment was reached
in the Dream from “Manon”; and at the
very end he put in some superfine work witli
Toti in the duet, between Edgardo and Lucia
from the first act of Donizetti’s melodic
work. Toti proved herself the same plump,
somewhat shrilly-sweet little lark that Syd-
ney lost its head over in grand opera. She
is not so fascinating on the concert plat-
form as when acting, but the voice, flexible
HIS MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
Make Aaams as Luitongi, the Silhouette -
Cutter, impersonating Count Beltrami.
and colorful, rose to enchanting realms.
On Saturday night, in the Cavatina from
Bizet’s “Pearl Fishers,” and on Monday, in
the Schumann number, “Sei Bella O Mia
Dolcezza,” she reached her Everest, although
"Caro Nome,” which opened Monday’s pro-
gramme, must have been the most interest-
ing to those who had not previously heard
the bird-like, fluent warble. Laurence God-
frey Smith each evening warmed up the
atmosphere for the entrance of the song-
birds with some fine piano work. Clarence
haybould accompanied.
While Dal Monte was farewelling Sydney
Melba was doing the same to her native
Melbourne. “La Bolihme” was the fare; but
the people were there for the occasion rather
than the performance. The Diva’s support
included Piccaluga, Ceresol, Huberdeau,
Laffi, Aurora Rettore and Gaetano Azzolini.
There was practically no applause during
the acts, not even on Melba’s first appear-
ance ; but it came in a tumult with every
"curtain,” an insistent series of recalls, un-
til the demonstration reached its zenith after
the last curtain, and amid the thunders and
hand-clapping a deluge of flowers rained on
the stage. The night was purely a personal
triumph, and not even the dreariness of the
speech, in which Prime Minister Bruce ex-
pressed the appreciation of Australia for
the retiring diva, dulled the enthusiasm. A
separate burst of applause came when Mayor
Brunton announced that the affair in vari-
ous ways had been responsible for raising
£lB,OOO for the Ifimbless Soldiers’ Fund.
An obscure playwright, whose style, though
somewhat turgid, shows occasional flashes of
genius, has written one of the most remark-
able endorsements of the White Australia
policy yet presented in this hemisphere. The
piece is called “Othello,” and Allan Wilkie,
who staged it at Sydney Palace on Satur-
day evening, before a deeply-moved audience,
is to be congratulated on liis initiative and
patriotism. Briefly, the plot centres on the
infatuation of Desdemona, the beautiful and
delicately nurtured daughter of a Venetian
senator, for Othello, a fat, bombastic, elderly
negro, with all the typically negroid traits of
sensuality, excessive excitability, vanity and
isentiment. The white girl’s secret marriage
with her repulsive lover causes the death from
grief of her father, and disgusts all Venice;
but Othello is a renegade soldier of fortune
who has been of service to the republic in its
wars with his co-religionists, the Turks, and
on this account the senators forgive him,
though they do not hide their abhorrence of
the match. The only man to remain faith-
ful to white ideals is lago, Othello’s ensign.
He plans to be revenged and, knowing the
negro temperament, easily converts Othello’s
passion for Desdemona- —the proprietary in-
stinct of the barbarian —into blood-lust.
Othello murders Desdemona, only to learn
that she was innocent; and after a great deal
of pompous attitudinising, he commits
suicide.
* * * *
The part of the gross African was power-
fully portrayed by Allan Wilkie; Miss
Hunter-Watts made a pliable Desdemona, a
woman of that very common type for whom
abnormality has an irresistible attraction:
Leslie Manners, as the clear-sighted lago
driven by circumstances to express his ideal-
ism in treachery and intrigue, acted with
great subtlety; while Irene Webb, as his
wife, Emilia, scored a distinct success. The
author of this striking exposition of the hor-
rors of miscegenation is not mentioned on
the programme; but whoever he is, he should
be worth watching. Dramatically, his art
may be open to criticism, but as political
propaganda this play of his should be more
effective than a thousand leading articles.

“The Laughter of Fools,” at Sydney
Criterion, is the discomfiture of three snobs.

ter attempt to graft a polished young man,

ished family tree. Their task is rendered

and a passion for auction sales. Being a
decent old chap he commands the sympathy
of the groundlings as he opposes the haughti-
ness of his spouse and children with amia-
bility and a habit of giving the family skele-
tons an airing. The second obstacle is a
modest and retiring niece, a sort of house-
hold Cinderella, whose personal attractions
are quite sufficient to ensure her being kept
in the background. But the clumsy ruses
employed to dispose of her have the opposite
effect, and by the end of the first act the
odds are in her favor. It is a simple story,
full of chuckles, moving to the inevitable
happy ending with scant deviation from the
expected. .T. D. O’Hara’s portrayal of John
Bassett Grieg, the henpecked husband, is ex-
cellent ; and Mary MacGregor plays Doris,
the niece, very winsomely. Nellie' Mortyne
offers a well-studied Mrs. Grieg, and as
Charles Vidal, the prize, Harvey Adams is
sincere. Lorna Helms scores tellingly in a
slavey rsle, Eileen Sparks (Mabel Grieg) is
pleasantly realistic, and Raymond Lawrence
a stilted Bertie. George Blunt, Reg Long
and Leslie Victor have minor parts which
they don’t discredit.

Under the spell of Beryl Beresford, at
Sydney Tiv., even the rent-collector is for-
gotten for a while. Except for a little
wasted time at the jump-off, when she con-
ducts some inaudible back-chat with the
house musicians from the floor of the stalls,
her 20 minutes’ appearance is full of clever
action and delightful eccentricities. Her
popularity is aided by a voice with a range
as wide as the Great Australian Bight.
Already many of her catch-phrases are in
currency. Albert Whelan is dragging aside
the curtain that shadows the past, and Walter
Weems, of the shoeblacked dial, keeps up
the flow of topical gags.
The Sydney Plumbers’ Union is keeping
a vigilant eye on Stiffy and Mo, who have
joined the plumbing trade for a week at
Pullers’ Theatre. Their antics are not, in
the opinion of the class-conscious worker,
likely to reduce the public’s disrespect for
the man who tinkers with the batli-plug, and
in the process manages to do something
deadly with the kitchen-sink; and yet regu-
lar patrons are barracking hard for more
humor of the same sinful brand.
“Being Respectable” seems to impose a
severe strain on the thirsty continent’s popu-
lace, and pathetic efforts to keep within
bounds can be seen at Sydney Lyric. “The

Little Red Schoolhouse” and its dainty
schoolmarm occupy the Lyceum’s screen,
where also Eve Lynn’s sweet voice falls like
a refreshing shower at interval-time. The
Crystal Palace and Globe have “The Bed-
room Window” on view, and a most con-
venient aperture for an assassin’s bullet
it is. Milton Sills, as a young farmer with
a Prisoners’ Aid Society complex, gets locked
up on a charge of vagrancy while attempt-
ing to keep a damsel away from a diet of
hominy. It happens at the Empress, and
they call it “Environment.” Joseph llerges-
heimer’s “Cytherea” is Hoyt’s offer, and
although it misses some of the delicate color-
ing and dreamy romanticism of the book, it
is a picture which this page recommends.
The African wild animals are being stalked
at the Rialto, and “Fisher’s Ghost” lias
journeyed from Old Sydney to the Shell.
Although “Bought and Paid For,” which
was given a revival last Saturday for the
tail-end of the Muriel Starr season at Mel-
bourne King’s, has all the hallmarks of a
temperance tract put into dramatic form,
it holds good acting possibilities; and the
interest of the audience was firmly held.
There are only six characters in the cast,
and they were all well played, the scenes
between Frank Harvey (Robert Stafford,
the amorous drunk) and Muriel Starr (Vir-
ginia Blaine, the ex-telephone girl) being
maintained with quiet strength, the lady’s
voice mannerisms less in evidence than
usual. As the stupid brother-in-law with
ambitions, John Fernside, although “fluffy”
on some of his lines, gave a surprisingly good
characterisation which, with the aid of the
young bounder’s shrewish wife, Fanny
(Jessie Page), provided a payable vein of
comedy. Rosamunde McMillan (Josephine,
a French maid) and Fred Coape (Oku,
Stafford’s Japanese valet) did what was
necessary.
The crack of Colonel Howett Worster
Belovar’s whip still sounds at His Majesty’s,
where some of the buds in “The Lady of
the Rose” now open out a trifle better in
the warm sun of public favor. At the New
Palace “Old Bill, M.P.,” continues to top
the poll, and seems quite unaffected by poli-
tical happenings in Britain ; and “The Rise
of Rosie O’Reilly” dances on with undi-
rninished liveliness at the New Princess’s.

Edward Goll completed a series of piano-
forte recitals at the Melba Hall with an
evening in which Beethoven’s celestial sonata
Opus 111 was the star item. It is a work
gleaming with tone wonders, in which Goll
was not afraid to challenge comparison with
Paderewski, who made it a favorite on his
Australian tour. Arnold Bax, who appears
likely to become a favorite since his intro-
duction recently by Fritz Hart, was repre-
sented by a sonata: its mysteries appeared
to lose Goll himself here and there, and cer-
tainly lost some of the audience. The player
has performed a useful service in interpreting
many modern masters at the series just
closed.

Vaudeville standards are for the moment
unusually high. Melbourne Tivoli, amongst
last week's new turns, added Brampton and
Poland, who offer some unusual feats of
strength in an artistically-staged act. A.
new sketch by Scott and Whaley keeps the
laughter bubbling from start to finish, and
the rest of the programme gives large oppor-
tunities for geysers of mirth.
On his first appearance at Melbourne
Royal it took Gene Morgan some time to
realise that the audience regarded his patter
as an infliction; but when, as the gods lifted
their voices, he woke up to the fact, he un-
wound some extraordinary dancing which
earned him the goodwill of the house. The
sangfroid with which the performer greeted
the approach of the bird and cheerfully
banked it to his account was not the least
notable thing about his turn. Hilda Glyder
still takes home the largest applause, and
Weldon the loudest laughs.
Previous good opinions were confirmed
when the Scottish basso, William Heughan,
opened at the Melbourne Assembly Ilall a
sequence of four concerts —the last two
booked for the Town Hall. In a variety of
numbers, including Scottish, English and
Russian folk songs and operatic arias, the
singer showed a good voice and dramatic
sympathy ; and a brief explanation of the
story buried in some of the numbers helped
his audience to an understanding. “Wi’ a
Hundred Pipers” gave a masterly display of
changes of feeling; and Heughan was equally
good in “character” songs like “The Mistress
and the Master” and “The Barrin’ of the
Door.” Miss Gladys Sayer was at the piano,
and the little Adelaide violinist, Miss Lilian
Pether, made a very likeable thing of Raff’s
“Cavatina.”

The nomadic Wirths are making- their

The opera co., having finished its Austra-

“Nero”: John Wren has leased his new
Melbourne theatre —the reconstructed Athen-
n'um in Collins-street —to E. J. Carroll. Over
£40,000 has been expended on the alterations,
which include seating accommodation for
1100, and an elaborately furnished foyer on
the street level. The theatre is expected
to be ready in November. Carroll will pro-
bably open it with an Australian grand opera
co. directed by Fritz Hart.
“Centurion”: “Hear, hear,” to “Wodgil’s”
plea for the old-time music-hall ditties (B.
2/10/’24). In the days when Bland Holt
was consul in the Province of Melodrama,
virtue was rewarded and villainy thwarted
in the music-hall also, while tbe
waters of sentiment often ran knee-deep
down the stage. No variety show was then
complete without some more or less sweet-
voiced tear-compeller who doled out her
“ballad” from the semi-circle of chairs in
the first part and in a turn of her own in
the second. Such a one, and typical of
them all, was Rae Cowan, a serious young
lady who was a regular feature of the old
Sydney Tivoli bill in the golden prime of
good Haroun Hal Rickards. When Rae
gave voice to “The Picture That Was
Turned Towards the Wa-a-11,” the said pic-
ture being that of a young female member
of a respectable family who took the prim-
rose path, even the ranks of Pope and Sayles
forbore to jeer, and the female gallery shed
tears like a cloudburst. “Don’t Tell Them
That You Saw Me” was a similar ballad
dealing with a somewhat similar damsel,
who met a childhood friend while prac-
tising Mi’s. Warren’s profession. Occasion-
ally the songstress brightened and gave us
ditties about baby. One I remember in
particular: it told of a model young husband
who didn’t drink, smoke or bet, and who
Never eared to wand-er or to roam.
With his bybv on his knee, he’s as happy as can be —
Ow, there’s no-o place like home, su-weet home.
Even the most hardened sinner, whose home
was where liis hat was, used to melt at that.
From George Portus :
Thanks for The Bulletin's references to the
Newcastle Steelworks Band. Following on our success
at Halifax, we lifted £l5O in cash and took posses-
sion of a gold trophy worth £2OOO for winning the
big Belle Vue contest in which, according to the
Manchester Guardian, “some of the finest bands this
country has produced took part.’’ The test piece
was a selection from Franz Liszt, arranged by Dr.
Keighly, one of the three judges, and the crowd
was estimated at 40,000, a hundred excursion trains
and 300 chars-a-banc having brought people from
distant parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It was
the first time an overseas band had won the com-
petition, which is 72 years old, and for the first
time also the music was re-laid by broadcasting
apparatus. Quoting the Guardian again, “the play-
ing throughout was excellent, but the audience
seemed quite in agreement with the verdict of the
judges.” We have lost only one working day since
we arrived in England, the Wembley people having
given us a three-months’ engagement—rthe longest
they have handed out to any band. The boys are
now working on the piece for the Crystal Palace
competition on Sept 27.
The Crystal Palace judges placed the Steel-
workers a close third to the St. Hilda Col-
liery and Blackdyke bands. Neither organ-
isation competed at Belle Vue, although the
more famous Besses-o’-the-Barn, who toured
Australia before the war, did.
“Private Boxer” : The £6OOO said to have
been lost over the failure of "The Royal
Visitor,” at London Majesty’s, did not come
out of Oscar Asche’s pocket. The big man
was engaged by Grossmitli and Malone, the
present lessees of the theatre, to produce and
play in the piece, which, by the way, was
adapted from a French original, “Le Roi,”
by two Parisian playwrights, De Flers and
He Caillavet. George Grossmitli himself
A REASONABLE PROTEST.
OLD PRO.: “I recited to some convicts yesterday, and I had them weeping—actually
weeping, laddie.”
YOUNG DITTO: "Shameful! And I suppose it wasn't in their sentences either, was it?”
was in the cast. Previous experience should
have taught him that the London public
prefers him to stick to musical comedy.
“Stellsby”: A spoken version of “Faust”
was given by Alfred Dampier’s co. at the
old Alexandra, Melbourne, in the ’nineties.
I have heard “Faust” sung in other parts of
the world, but nowhere have I seen a foreign
or English Mepliisto to compare with Dam-
pier’s. histrionically. Of the operatic
Fausts I can- recall, Plancon, the Frenchman,
was the best, but his acting wasn’t a patch
on Alfred’s.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Dave O’Connor once
helped the Firm out of a bad fix. Fred
Maguire, playing one of the leading rftles
in “The Waltz Dream” (Dot Brunton was in
the cast), went down with a sore throat
which rendered his voice almost inaudible,
and, to make matters desperate, his part,
which was full of musical numbers, was
uncovered by an understudy. O’Connor
happened to be in town, having just returned
from one of his country tours. Strolling
into His Majesty’s, he went round to the
stage door, where a harassed s.-m. told him
the cause of his face-wrinkles. O’Connor
promptly announced that he knew the part;
and, what is more, he played and sang it
excellently.
“C. Ockney”: Charlotte Crabtree, who died
recently in her native America, is reported
to have left an estate worth £BOO,OOO, in
which case she was easily the richest player
that ever lived. Charles Wyndliam was
reckoned to have held that distinction—his
executors paid death duties on £197,035. I
was a very young galleryite when “Lotta”
(as she was always styled on the bills)
appeared at London Opera Comique in her
version of “The Old Curiosity Shop.” Her
Marchioness was a richly comic creation,
but her Little Nell, which part she “doubled,”
was not half as convincing. It was the
Dickens play’s success in the U.S.A. that
made “Lotta” a rich woman.
“Plamfat”: The absorption of the Tivoli
interests by the Williamson firm is already
producing results. During the racing season
musical comedy re-appears at Melbourne
Royal, and vaudeville will be left to the show
across the road. When the different manage-
ments were competing for overseas head-
liners Australia got some very fine acts, and
local vaudeville salaries went up. Contracts
made long before the absorption have been
maintaining the standard of imported turns,
but under the new arrangement salaries are
likely to slump. It is to be feared that
the quality of the shows may slump also,
but that does not necessarily follow. Some
of the biggest salaries in Australia have
been earned by duds; and some of the bright-
est performers have received attenuated pay-
envelopes.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The managerial expla-
nation of that whip-cracking act in ‘‘The
Lady of the Rose” (B. 9/10/’24) is that
it is in keeping with the part. It is alleged
that the officers of swell European cavalry
regiments used to carry whips to flog the
citizens of conquered cities and to chastise
their own troops if necessary. Even so, the
most uncouth specimen of the breed would
hardly swank into a lady’s drawing-room
cracking a whip. There is a story of a
French general of the Napoleonic period who
notified a noble dame in a conquered district
that he had conceived a passion for her, and
that unless she returned it he would be under
the painful necessitv of having her relations
hanged, the army being short of powder. It
desolated him to say so. the impassioned om
added, but the hanging would be done at
the rate of one relation for every four hours
of feminine obduracy. That was a case in
which the whip cracked, as it were, but at
least the gentleman spared the lady's
drawing-room vases.
“L.11.P.”: Mention of Fannie Liddiard
(B. 25/9/’24) recalls many happy hours I
spent watching and listening to that one-
time favorite of the footlights. I first saw
Fannie in Maoriland 41 years ago; she was
a member of Howard Vernon’s “Tambour
Major” co., and played the drummer-boy.
With Vernon’s crowd she figured also as
Lady Jane in “Patience,” Lange in “Madame
Angot,” and the lead in “Billee Taylor,” an
opera that failed in M.L. as it did in Aus-
tralia. Returning to Maoriland with the
Royal Comics in ISS4, Fannie made a hit
as “Olivette” in Audran’s char rung opera;
and other parts she played in Maoriland at
various times were Fiametta (“La Mas-
cotte”), Germaine (“Les Cloches”), Gipsy
Queen (“The Bohemian Girl”), Lazar-
illo (“Maritana”), Lydia (“Dorothy”),
Phoebe (“Yeomen of the Guard”), and Lady
Blanche (“Princess Ida”). Fannie was one
of the joys of Rice’s “Evangeline” at Syd-
ney Royal in 1891, when the whole town
hummed the chorus of “I’m in Love with the
Man in the Moon.” and laughed at the antics
of the Lone Fisherman. After that show
I never saw her again.
“The Deacon”: It wasn’t only at Rock-
hampton (Q.) that Phil Lytton put on an
aeroplane show (B. 9/10/’24). In 1912
Phil hired the Ascot (Sydney) course and
spent a small fortune advertising a race
between “Wizard” Stone and the young Aus-
tralian flying pioneer, dentist Billy Hart. A
fair crowd paid the couple of bob admission,
but there were thousands outside on the
sandhills that surround the salubrious
locality. The race was to have been to Parra-
matta and back, approximately 30 miles, but
the weather gods were unsmiling, and a dis-
contented populace watched the hangars for
the' whole of a dreary afternoon. Finally
Stone essayed a short flight, and in returning
to earth his fiercely-revolving propellers fur-
nished a thrill by nearly cutting a police-
man’s horse to sausage-meat. In the grow-
ing dusk Hart went up in his old ’bus, which
depended for stays on mostly second-hand
piano wire, and was blown out over the
waters of Botany Bay. He had given up
hope of ever jigging back, and was anxiously
watching for a sign of a sail, when the
wind mercifully veered round and carried
him home. A bad breakdown in the
tram service contributed to the debacle, and
it was a thoroughly miserable showman that
went back to his pub.
“Actor Once”: During Melbourne Show
week I once more met the Will Whitburn who
was the vaudeville favorite of a generation
ago. Still interested in trotters and pacers the
veteran won first and championship prizes
for a trotting marc, and, from 40 yards be
hind, sent one of his string to victory in the
Royal Handicap Trot. Will Whitbourne
( that’s his real name) was the son of a
Launceston horsetrainer, and, after some
minor breaks into vaudeville, definitely left
his job of stable foreman for the stage when
lie was 19. After 28 years of success, and
not giving the public time to get tired of him,
he went back to horse-training. His first
appearances were with Hussey and Lawton’s
Minstrels at St. George’s Hall, Bourke-strect
—where Hoyt’s picture show now stands.
“Hamfat”: Where Hoyt’s theatre now
stands in Melbourne St. George’s Hall used
to be a favorite insect-farm. Fondly known
as “Flea Alley,” it w r as the venue of a
pioneer venture in pitchers. The venturer
was Arthur Russell, sportsman and all-round
good fellow, who, although a dentist by pro-
fession, plunged into all kinds of theatrical
or quasi-theatrical undertakings—he once
took a waxworks show to Fiji. He had only
£9OO when he took his flickers to Flea Alley,
and for six months he steadily lost slightly
over £lOO per month. Then affairs took a
turn for the better. A company was formed
a modern picture-house was built, and
Russell was £27,000 ahead of it when he
died. There were fortunes to be made in
the business then. I doubt if it is so now.
“Philm Up”: What a lot of poppycock is
talked by those in the trade whenever it is
suggested that a little cleaning up of the
movie business is desirable! One of the argu-
ments advanced by the indignant showmen
against Pratten’s “interference” with their
“industry” is that the dear public would
soon signify its displeasure if anything sala-
cious were shown on the screen—a public
that has been educated according to the
standard of taste ruling at Hollywood. Even
the Argus writer who contributes a weekly
column about the pictures advertised in Mel-
bourne takes much the same line. Increased
attendances at the Ditcher-palaces, according
to his weird reasoning, show that the public
docs not disapprove of the fare provided.
But there was a very big attendance outside
Melbourne Gaol on the day Angus Murray
was hanged.
TALLIS VOTES FOR TIGHTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After studying the situation in New York and
London, Mr. George Tallis, a director of J. O.
Williamson, Ltd., informed a Sydney Son reporter
that he ‘prefers tights to the latest vogue of bare
legs.’ **
Ballerinas—should they show
Calves and with nothing hid,
Or in fleshings should they go,
As their mas and grandmas did ?
Such the problem that perplexed
Those who guide our learned stage;
Graver question never vexed
Minds in this our mother-age.
Tumult raged in cot and palace
Round the wrongs and rights:
Anger, envy, scorn and malice
Ruled until they sent for Tallis—
Tallis votes for tights.
Long the pros and cons, he weighed
Till conviction came to him
That the leg in silk arrayed
Licks the merely powdered limb.
Picture George, devoted drudge
(Hero, rather), seated where
Calves in thousands he could judge,
Outline, muscle, skin —and hair.
Paris, to CEnone callous,
Never had such sights;
Socrates, who drained a chalice,
Was no downier bird than Tallis—•
Tallis, who’s for tights.
Long-eared journalistic geese,
Lovely ladies, frilled and floum ed,
Let the shrill contention c ease-
judgment is at length pronounced.
George, who vigils grimly kept
That a verdict lie might frame
Which the public would accept,
Hail him gamest of the game.
People now from Cue to Challis
House may sleep of night's:
Stilled is envy, scorn and malice,
And we owe it all to Tallis—
Tallis plumps for tights.

IF you’re keen on the bolt action, take a look
at the Savage Sporter model 23-A calibre
.22 —clean, graceful lines of a greyhound-
tough lasting strength of a bulldog. Deadly
accurate too, swift and sure in action, light
to carry and perfectly balanced. (Also fur-
nished in calibres .25-20 and .32-20).
Or if you prefer the slide action, examine
the Savage Model 14. Note the shape and
position of the slide handle —no cramping of arm
or wrist. Action —short, quick, easy. Sturdy:
solid breach, solid top, no exposed parts.
No matter what type of rifle you prefer,
no matter what use you may put it to, you
can always depend upon a Savage.

T \KE NOTICE that your wife ETHEL ELIZABETH
HARM \N of Wanganui has filed in the Supreme Courr,
of New Zealand at Wanganui a petition in divorce
against you claiming dissolution of her marriage on
fhp srounds of desertion.

to forward to him the foregoing advertisement

The breaking strain of “Sylk-
Arto” thread is probably
greater than that of thread
used in any other Silk Stock-
ing, at any price.

If it isn'f
it is not as Good,
Imitation, “the Sincerest form of Flattery,” always follows the
production of an article which serves a particular purpose infinitely
better than anything of its type previously available. Rarely,
however, is the imitation equal to the original, and the fact that it
is usually offered at a lower price is, in itself, evidence of inferiority.
When Bond’s scientific staff evolved “Sylk-Arto” Hosiery, they produced
something entirely new —a stocking that combined the obvious advantages
of pure silk textures with the beautiful lustre which is the most attractive
attribute of high-grade artificial silk —a stocking that possessed wear resist-
ance never before equalled in either pure silk or artificial silk hosiery, and
yet could be sold at a comparatively low price.
That Bondi’s “Sylk-Arto” met a definite need, as no hosiery had done before, is proved by its immediate
and phenomenal popularity. Within a few months from the time it was offered to the public the sales
of “Sylk-Arto” throughout the Commonwealth exceeded those of all other makes of Silk Hosiery
put together. The fact that the demand has since steadily increased proves that “Sylk-Arto” has
justified under the test of wear, the unique claims made in its favor.
As a natural consequence, “Sylk-Arto” has been honored by “the Sincerest form of Flattery.” It is
quite possible, therefore, that when you ask for Bond’s “Sylk-Arto” Hosiery, you may be offered
something that merely looks like it. If so, you may safeguard yourself in a very simple manner.
See that the stocking you are offered carries AT THE TOP the circular “Sylk-Arto” label specifying
its selling price, 6/11, and that it bears AT THE FOOT the “Sylk-Arto” transfer, here reproduced.
Without these marks of identity the stocking is not Bond’s “Sylk-Arto,” and if it isn’t “Sylk-Arto”
it is not as good.
Bond's “Sylk-Arto” features seam at back, tops
and feet of mercerised lisle. Obtainable in 30
shades. Sells everywhere at

Molly Coddle: She can call herself what
she likes except in certain legal and semi-legal docu-
ments. . . .Cute O.: Not well enough done to push its
small point through... .C.J.L. It would make a capi-
tal par of 25 lines. Will you try it ?.... Gisborne:
You’ll hear that dog bark at Christmas. .. .J.E.A.:
The same points were made in a recent discussion....
N.S.M.: “It seems hard that a mere girl can wreck
a man’s life.” True;* but it’s wonderful how many
salvage parties the sex also supplies W.L.D.: Have
heard of country pubs raising worse ghosts than
yours... . A.W.M.: “Here you will see prosperous
business men with a different wife each visit; and
not the slightest surprise shown at this amazing
state of affairs.” And then you leave out the
really interesting part—the address of this Arcady....
Ripponlea; Now, this does move us:—
EXILED IN THE BUSH.
How I long for sounds that round the Town abound ?
The cadenza of a rabbit-oh, how I long for the sound.
Or the boots of a boarder next door
As they land with a flop on th’ floor;
A cab-horse’s hoofs,
Or cats on the roofs,
My corpulent room-mate’s snore,
Or a neighboring gramophoue’s roar J
The burbling brawl of a brook
The cackling cry of a chook,
The clarion call of a cow,
Th’ somnolent snorts of th’ sow,
The frightful fracas of the frog,
The consumptive croak of th’ mournful mo-poke,
And the baritone bark of a dbg,
Are an offend to mine delicate ears,
Yes, a strain on those sensitive organs;
And when a curlew I do hear,
It gives me th’ bally Joe Morgans,
j... .Rouelle; Very well done; but the subject is
rather off our beat.... Femina; The Lord forgive us
if we ever printed anything that made you think
we’d print “The Calico Ball” H.D.: All starch
and no stuffing... .Rover: Studies in roguery might
interest Inspector Mitchell.... E. 8 .: Agree with the
conclusion, but the story is pretty tiresome. ...
W.E.C.: Dull as most diaries are—chiefly because
they are not sincere. You haven’t caught “the
elusive muse’’ yet Mombak; We can only hope
that the jury brought in a verdict of suicide by a
blow from a log:
Rory O’Moore
Was down on the floor,
Full as an egg with beer,
And his wife, Mrs. Moore,
As she slammed the door,
Looked on with an angry leer.
“Your brain’s in a fog,
You drunken dog,
To be drunk is very sinful,
And you I will flog
With this here log
As sure as you’ve got a skinful.”
So she lost her wool.
Like an angry bull
She charged and hit his head.
The sound was dull, '
And Rory’s soul,
To the cloud tops fled.
His wife they tried.
At the trial she lied.
And said that Rory was drunk,
Hit himself (here she sighed)
With a log (bitterly she cried),
And lifeless to the floor he sunk,
. ... A.D.M.: An Elizabethan sonnet is more than three
quatrains (and a couplet. By that arrangement you
lose the movement. Many of the lines are too slack;
and the whole has not enough interest for its length.
. ...J.S.P.: Most of it has no resemblance to verse;
the rest is p00r.... Onlooker: Pretty crude and
commonplace.... Hunter C.; The prose was evil
enough without tying it with that rope of bad verse.
.. . .Stella B.: Clumsy and dull. .. .G.R. (Maylands) :
It only scores an outer... . W.L.W.: What on earth
is the good of gathering all the things that have
been most often said and presenting them as “A
Reverie” ?.... Hylda W.: Shows a poor notion of
metre and none of rhyme.... O.M. (Narrabri) ; None
of them quite manage it... .A.E.C.; Thin and weak
as a prison breakfast... .N.S.M.; Nothing fresh and
nothing well said..,.S.T. (Hurstville) : As a. first
attempt it is good, but the matter is rather that
of the cheap sentimental ballad. .. .The Knut: The verse
is poor and the statistics arc not garnished attractively.
.... Violet R.: That kind of writing is about the worst
known; and the yarn isn’t much. ... A.M.8.: Doesn’t
get near. ... A.D.: “The Shrewd Head” hasn’t enough
interest.... Billilingra: It couldn’t say much less
than that.... Rub: But why break into laborious
verse merely to state the bald fact that you are
lazy?... . 8.J.A,: The verse is far, far away....
G.M.H.: Too crammed with commonplace... .Fanner’s
Wife: The verse is too lame to carry it. .. .M.M.C.:
The lines are very lumpy... .Gladys B.: If the sub-
ject had been less repulsive “Sorry Scheme” would
have got through.... Mab B.: “Beauty” has a smart
idea, but isn’t done well enough... .C.W.: “His
Reason” has only the material for a par J.M.W.:
It dawdles too often on the way... . J.M.D.: Stephen
Leacock has done it better.. ..M.N.W.: It would take
a master pen to make that hackneyed subject live
again.... A.8.C.: You don’t make your point sharp
enough.... Bar One: You’ve made your effort to be
amusing too conspicuous... ,C.A.N.; Old material
poorly tailored... .W.H.S.; Some simple ideas to
start with are: (1) A country should export enough
to pay for its imports; (2) if it is loaded with
foreign debt (Federal, State, municipal or private, or
all four), which is Australia’s case, it should export
so much more goods than it imports that the difference
vill pay the interest and something off the principal ;
(3) it is folly to listen to the kind of reciprocity
shark who wants us to export raw materials only and
import manufactured goods. Raw material countries
are mostly poor. Besides, war and blockade are
always possible, and then the raw material can't lie
sold, and the finished goods don’t arrive, and man is
liable to become a monkey; (4) The Bulletin never
said Australia should export heaps of goods and
import only sovereigns, so that it might sit down
and gloat over the useless pile. Who stuffed your
mind with that rubbish?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
N.: You don’t leave that baby on our doorstep, at
any rate... .R.S.W.: Lost to hope and deserving no
charity.... 99: Your penname reminds us of the
doctor and your pictures are reminiscent of the
morgue... .L.H.: We abhor a pun as nature dislikes
a vacuum. Long-winded theological argument re-
ferred to Religious Editor, wljo settled it with an
axe. ...R.8.: Can’t work up any sympathy for your
small boy; he deserved all his punishment for being
so abominably drawn N.B. (aged 13): Let off,
with a caution not to come up again for seven
years... . A.V.8.: You have original ideas about farm-
yards... .C.C. and 1.D.: Unsuitable.

and the Reason is this:-
Cletrae replaces eight horses _oti the
Farm, works quicker and in any
weather at half the cost of horse feed,
consequently the Farmer is not only
saving money on working costs, but is
enabled to work more ground in less
time and do a better job that will
produce bigger yields and superior
crops. Added to this the Cletrac. with
its power pulley, does work impos-
sible to horses, - and is a labor-saving
and money-making proposition.

A LL AUSTRALIANS visiting London
should read the British Australian
and New Zealander, 6d. weekly—an illus-
trated paper containing mail and cable news
from Australia and news of Australians in
Europe and at home. Australians are cordi-
ally invited to visit the British Australian
and New Zealander Reading-room at the
Offices, 51 High Holborn, London, W.C.
where they can see the home papers, meet
their friends, use the telephone, and obtain
information without charge.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Micromegas”: A record consignment of
fruit —409 tons of bananas, pines, tomatoes,
cucumbers and oranges—passed through
Wallaugarra the other day from Queensland
to the south.
“Nux Vomica”: Counter-prescribing by
chemists is not forbidden by law (what a
howl there would be from the public if it
were!) in the State of N. S. Wales, nor to
my knowledge in any other State of the Com-
monwealth.
* * * ♦
“Micromegas”: Three big Bananaland sta-
tions have changed hands during the last few
weeks. Albilbah. near Isisford (C.Q.), cover-
ing 231 sq. miles of leasehold, and taking
with it 30,000 sheep, 330 cattle and 150
horses, is now in C.Q. hands. So is Siberia,
near Winton (C.Q.), 30,000 acres of pastoral
leasehold, with sub-artesian bores, and carry-
ing 5900 ewes and 0700 wethers. Lloyd,
late of Craigmore (C.Q.), got the third,
Weribone, near Surat (S.Q.), from Sydney
owners ; the price was six figures.
* * * •
“P.T.”: The “dog-tickei ” mentioned by
“Bouragi” (B. 25/9/’24) as being issued
to masters of Papuan coastal vessels with
just sufficient knowledge of navigation to
scratch from one headland to another is
known also as a “dog-barker.” The theory
is that the cautious mariner keeps
close enough inshore to hear the dogs.
After a few years on one run he knows
every dog on the coast and can distinguish
one from another by its vocal characteristics.
When he loses his hearings on a foggy night
he edges in till Towser or Rover tells him
where he is. Anyway, that’s the yarn of
scornful deep-sea shellbacks.
* * * *
“Capta”: Some time ago Bulletin coun-
sellors were talking about substitutes for
black-mangrove sticks in oyster propagation.
French oyster-farmers use earthenware tiles,
drain-pipes, etc., which they coat with thick
whitewash. When dry these are placed in
estuaries, and the incoming oyster-spat
attaches itself thereto. When the earthen-
ware is lifted the spat can be removed with-
out injury, as the whitewash flakes off easily.
It should he worth a trial here, because black-
mangrove sticks are somewhat difficult to
obtain, and are useless after one or two
usings, whereas the drain-pipes and tiles can
be used indefinitely, and any old broken
stuff will do.
* * * *
“Mag. Sulph.” : “Cartot” is wrong in assert-
ing (B. 25/9/’24) that counter-prescribing
by chemists is against the law —at any rate,
in Victoria. If it were, there would be no
such thing as selling a patent medicine or
a chemist’s own proprietary line. The re-
sult would be that more than half of us
would have to shut up shop, for few chemists
could exist on the dispensing part of the
business. Prescribing is as much a part of
our profession as it is of a medico’s, and
many men have built up a business on their
ability in this direction. If “Cartot” had
a headache after the night before would he
go to a doctor for half a guinea’s worth of
medical lore or to the chemist for free advice
and a bracer at the counter?
* * * *
“Tarago”: The country bank-clerk who
gave himself a pleasant hour or two by pin-
ning the corner of a pound-note between the
leaves of a blotter (B. 18/9/’24) reminds
me of a Melbourne suburban barber who
was wont to derive amusement from watch-
ing his customers furtively trying to remove a
shilling securely glued to a showcase on
the counter. The favorite method was to
rest the elbow on the coin while attempting
to get it from under the sleeve by a stealthy
movement of the other hand. Failing that
acquisitive persons would attempt to brush
it on to the floor. But at least one would-
be annexer of the exhibit showed a streak
of originality. On receiving change after
making a purchase he spilled, as if by acci-
dent, a handful of silver over the fixed de-
posit, and with a curse at his own clumsi-
ness. hurriedly began to gather it up again.
But even he failed to pick up the last
shilling
* * * *
“Henry Pannikin”: A poker school in a
N.S.W. North Coast township came in for
police attention on a recent evening. Two
Johns were posted below the only window the
room contained, while the sergeant knocked
at the door and demanded admittance. There
was a wild scramble. Chairs went over,
silver was rattled, the window-catch clicked
and a mass of scared gamblers jumped
through 14ft. of space into the arms of the
Law. All were grabbed and marched off, bar
one. A six-inch nail caught in the seat of
his pants aud kept him suspended until the
coast was clear. Then he gave a bit of a
wriggle, the cloth tore and he dropped to
earth with no damage beyond that to his gar-
ments. And that was little enough beside
the three-pound fine the others had to pay.
“Strike me pink.” he said when recounting
his hairbreadth ’scape at the pub next day,
“I w r as lucky all right. When I was ’angin’
’ead down every coin I had on me dropped
from me pockets. And the Johns never
noticed.”
* • • •
“Nitric”: “ Johnnick” deduces that young
Australia isn’t prepared to “go in for science
for the fun of the thing” from the fact that
none of the 200 applicants for Capt. Wil-
kins’s research job in N.Q. were scientifically
trained. Is it a wonder when the salary
offered is less than the basic wage? There
would have been plenty of applications from
science graduates if the screw’ had been not
less than £3OO per annum, which is what a
young teacher freshly graduated gets. Ex-
cept teachers’ jobs there are few openings
for the scientist in Australia. In entomology
the starting screw in one State is £2OO, with
yearly increments rising to £325. A sugar
chemist (’Varsity graduate) can command
£3OO if he is prepared to soak and vegetate
in the Innisfail district. Billets for indus-
trial chemists are few and far between. For
a time the promise of an establishment of
stations in Australia by the Rockefeller In-
stitute brightened things a little, but it
came to nothing, and even the prickly pear
curse gives employment to only half a dozen
chemists. There is but a poor financial re-
turn offering at present for five years’ secon-
dare schooling and three years’ ’Varsity
training,

Died in Bundaberg (Q.)> aged 78, J. B-
Drinnen, who won a V.C. at Delhi during the
Indian Mutiny. For 30 years past he had
worked on Bingera plantation.
William Farquhar, the N. S. Wales rail-
way man who was driver of the royal train
when George and Mary visited Australia in
1901, died a few days ago. He was 83 when
the whistle blew.
Disney, Hon. Minister in the Vic. Labor
Government, has been municipal councillor
and Mayor as well as member of the Uppah
Cliambah; yet the only contest he ever faced
was for the Cabinet. Under Caucus rule
Labor elects its Ministers, and there was no
chance there of the walk-overs he got out-
side.
The two partners in a long-established
Rockhampton (C.Q.) hardware business
passed out recently within _a few weeks ol
one another —Herbert Williams and G. D.
Graham. The former was prominent in
public affairs, and an enthusiast at bowls.
The latters father was a pioneef- of Bendigo
who gave up gold-digging for store- and pub-
keeping.
Mrs. Rienits died recently at “The School.”
Mt. Victoria (N.S.W.), the institution which
she and her husband founded 44 years ago.
Originally from Ipswich (Eng.), she was 11
years old on arrival, and later on joined the
Education Department, where she met her
future husband. She was a woman of parts,
and her school attracted boys from all over
Australia. She had one of the finest collec-
tions of stamps in the State; her other hobby
was Red Cross work.
“C. Snook”: According to Riley, Labor
M.H.R., in the matter of the alleged Doug-
las Mawson castaways.
The delay, in despatching a rescue expedition was
due to the fact that the captives were the wife and
daughter of a laborer.
As Minister Bowden put it (B. 28/9/’24),
“there had been unexpected delay at Darwin
in the despatch of the Huddersfield, owing
to trouble with the crew.” Possibly a case
of woman’s extremity being man’s oppor-
tunity.
Labor in Australia has lost one of its
hard old fighters—James Ling, the most
militant president the Plasterers’ Union has
ever known. A man of considerable culture,
he was the leader of the building strike in
Melbourne in 1885, earning for himself a
disqualification from the Vic. Master Build-
ers. Brisbane occupied him for a while,
but he was soon in Sydney, signalising liis
arrival by immediately getting into verbal
holts with then Premier George Dibbs. His
correspondence ceased at 75.
Young Fitzroy Jardine, of Rockhampton
(Q.), one of Sydney ’Varsity’s brilliant re-
cent products, has completed his course, top-
ping his year throughout. He is now attached
to the Great Barrier Reef Committee, in
whose interests he is studying coral insects
and other mammalia with Charles Hedley,
the Director. In the last final exams.
.Tardine secured first-class honors in geologi-
cal science, the University medal for science,
Professor David’s prize and the Deas Thomp-
son scholarship. Appropriately he was a
birdman in the war, and was mentioned in
despatches.
Bishop Patrick Cleary, of Auckland
(M.L.), who has had the Dominion's latest
mild sensation on his hands —a highly edu-
cated schoolgirl refused to go home unless her
mother allowed her to become an R.C., and
her mother wouldn’t —is an Enniscortliy man,
who before being a bishop was for many
years editor of the Tablet, the official R.C.
organ for the Shaky Isles. After being
associated with Bishop Verdon for many
years, lie was made Bishop of Auckland in
1910. on the death of the Englishman. Dr.
Lenihan. Latterly ill-health has kept him on
the easy list, but his controversial claws are
still sharp. He is over 70.
“Pyro”: Let me push into the argument
rc unusual War casualties with an outsize
in queer incidents. Whilst we were in the
Albert salient we dislodged some machine-
gunners in the Hun lines. I collected a
souvenir in the shape of an unexploded Skoda
shell; like all Fritz gear it was a well-bur-
nished missile. After cleaning out the charge
and removing the time-fuse, I sent it home
to some friends, who utilised it for a door
stop. One day it was pinched by a preda-
tory tramp, who, when detected and chased,
let it drop on the pavement. Followed a
terrific explosion, which badly damaged the
collector. Can any artillery expert diagnose?
The shell had been handled by a lot of our
battery comrades, and certified harmless.
“Quiz”: Captain Alfred Easton, who
piloted the Renown into Port Phillip, has
been off duty of late owing to failing health.
He gained his earlier seafaring experience
in “windjammers” of the Aberdeen line;
later, he served as master in Howard-Smith
coasters before entering the pilot service.
Shortly after war was declared Easton
boarded a German ship off Port Phillip
Heads. Fresh from a long non-stop voyage
the German skipper knew nothing of the
stirring events that had just happened. It
was not until the vessel had been “slowed
down.” by the pilot’s orders, just inside the
Heads, and a naval launch carrying an armed
crew shot up alongside, that Fritz scented
clanger. Rushing to the wheel, he loudly
expressed his intention of making a bolt for
it. “Madness, captain,” calmly observed the
pilot; “the guns of the port are trained on
your ship.” The German thought better of it.
“Echo”: Regarding political magnanimity
(B. 11/9/’24), what about the performance
of Simon Hickey, N.S.W. Labor Speaker
for a few' days in the last Parliament? At
the 1921 election the Machine divided Botany
into four divisions, one each for Hickey and
the other three sitting Laborites, Mutch,
Burke and Mclvell. Ratcliffe, a 1917 rail-
way striker, having run fifth in tlie selection
ballot, was expected to take No.. 5 vote. In-
stead, he went into all four divisions, and
asked for No. 1, and was promptly dis-
qualified by the A.L.P. executive. Sympa-
thetic support at once followed, and it was
clear one of the sitting members had to go.
Part of McKell’s Redfern division showed
indications of trying to save Hickey, but the
night before the poll Simon went round to
McKell’s meetings and asked them not to
vote No. 1 for him, as he had his own divi-
sion. In the result Ratcliffe and Mclvell
were passed in, while Hickey was passed out.
Simon took it without a whimper.

WAX Your Linoleum
JOHNSON’S POLISHING WAX (Paste and
Liquid) is endorsed by all the leading
turers of linoleum for polishing, preserving and
protecting their product. Read the paragraphs below,
which are quoted from a letter written by the
Armstrong Linoleum Co. on July 5, 1923, to S. C.
T ohnson & Son: —
“Our Research Department has tested John-
son’s Wax on a number of occasions, and has
approved it very highly for use on Armstrong s
Linoleums. We have been recommending John-
son’s Wax in our advertising literature for pro-
bably ten years, and no user of our goods has
ever made a complaint to us regarding the satis-
faction secured by the use of Johnson’s Wax on
our linoleum.
“An application of a good wax, thoroughly
rubbed in, provides a film of wax over the surface
of the linoleum which hardens and prevents dirt
from being ground into the linoleum itself. It is,
therefore, much easier to clean a linoleum floor
that has been properly waxed, because the dirt
is readily wiped off the surface. Wax also pre-
serves linoleum and takes off a good deal of the
wear.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HOW shall dead dreamers lie?
Feet to the wind,
While the night voices cry,
“Lo, ye have sinned!”
Coldly the great stars gaze
Down through the trees —-
Cover with wasted leaves
Wantons like these!
Ants on the ant-heap run,
Finding life sweet;
Men in the rain and sun
Love the grey street.
Gain and the hope of gain
Cut like a knife;
Joy of the eager pain
Bubbles with life.
Only the dreamers live
Far from these things
Seeking a prize to give
Worthy of kings.
Seeking a thing unfound,
Scorning the rest;
All their warm senses drowned
Deep in the quest.
Ants on the ant-heap make
Cycles complete;
Men have the world to take
There in the street.
Men have the world to win,
Grasping with haste;
Only the dreamers sin,
Letting life waste,
Tossing a golden word
Far on the air—
Lilt of an idle bird,
Useless and fair.
Coldly the white stars gaze
Down through the trees —
Cover with wasted leaves
Wantons like these!
Men of their pride have won
Heaps of grey dust;
Great under moon and sun
Still is their trust.
Dreamers of pride have lost
Something unfound—
Echoes of little cost
Whispers of sound.
How shall the dreamers rest?—
Feet to the morning,
Holding the dream is best
In the dream's scorning.

1062.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOR thirty years Salesby had spent the
journey between Strathfield and Syd-
ney running through his morning
paper. By the time the train made its pause
in the darkness of the Redfern tunnel he was
able to throw the sheet aside, satisfied that
he had seen everything in it of interest to
him. It was when he could no longer do
this that he realised something was wrong.
At first he ascribed his inability to con-
centrate on the news, or to remember the
purport of a sentence immediately after
reading it, to a temporary indisposition; but,
as morning after morning passed and found
him the same, he grew apprehensive. Dog-
gedly he would open the paper; doggedly he
glued his eyes on the type. Then when,
looking up, he taxed his mind to recollect
what he had read, and failed, an impotent
rage filled him. He could have sworn or
screamed at the sense of power lost.
Looking out of the window, with the paper
hanging over his knees from a listless hand,
he idly watched an unattached engine slowly
moving in the Eveleigh yard. A number
stood out, large, on its side —1062. With a
start he felt that he had seen that engine
often before. Out of the back of his mind he
dragged a memory of having watched that
same number, in a subconscious fashion,
time and again. Without any reason that he
could fix upon, there seemed to be something
ominous in its recurrence.
The idea remained with him in a vague
fashion all day. When he was talking to
Clarkson over the Darrah Estate deal he
pencilled figures on the pad to work out cer-
tain points of importance, and then in sheer
idleness marked the pad with other numbers.
When the interview closed he found himself
staring at the figures 1062, with two heavy
lines under them. Later, he used the tele-
phone, and while waiting for a reply fiddled
with the pencil. And presently he again saw
“1062” facing him.
When Dr. Markham called that night
Salesby asked his advice. The prescription
was an immediate holiday. The invalid’s
retort was explicit: to leave his business
was impossible. He felt angry that such
an impossible thing should have been sug-
gested.
“All I can do is to repeat the advice —
very strongly,” said the doctor. “The irrita-
bility you felt at the suggestion in itself is
an indication that the rest is badly needed.
Every hour you persist in flogging your
tired system brings a severe breakdown
nearer. You are not a poor man: you can
afford a holiday. Not all the money you
might make will compensate you for the loss
of your health.”
Then there came a rush of work that gave
him little time for morbid thoughts. The
feeling of achievement benefited him, and
he mentally scoffed at the doctor’s declara-
tion that he must relinquish his work.
But when comparative idleness returned
the sense of well being that had come with
the rush of business vanished, leaving him as
restless, nervous and irritable as ever.
On his way home one night he tried to
read an evening paper, but its headlines
blurred together in a meaningless jumble.
Gazing listlessly out of the train window,
he became aware suddenly that there was
a shadow looming somewhere near. Involun-
tarily he turned his head. He had known
what he would see. An engine was moving
on the line next to the one in which he was
travelling; and its number was 1062.
A terror overwhelmed him —a terror so
absurd that it made him angry with himself.
The impression was vivid within him that
this massive engine was something more than
a mere mass of steel; that there was some-
thing sinister about it, something that was
spying upon him, and tracking him. The
feeling was so strong that he leaned back,
swiftly removing his face from the window,
and putting solid wood between him and
what he was beginning to regard as a malign
familiar. But it crept ahead, coming into
sight once more, and giving him the feeling
that it had eyes that were peering around,
trying to view him again. He was ridicu-
lously relieved when outside Redfern tunnel
he found that the thing had been left be-
hind. The relief increased as his own train
gathered speed: he felt as though he were
hurrying away from dreadful danger.
But why? Why should the mere sighting
of an engine day after day—not even a re-
markable coincidence, if it was engaged on
regular work—oppress him so? He was ill,
of course; that explained everything. And
yet the explanation did not satisfy him.
There was something else. He groped
blankly. 1062? 1062? The number sug-
gested nothing.
And then he remembered Batson. The
inevitable connection between the man and
the number impressed him even whilst he
fiercely derided the mental processes that
allied them. Batsou, an enginedriver or
something—something in the railway service,
anyway. And Batson had a grievance against
him. Rather a likeable fellow, Batson, with
a nice, devoted wife and five kiddies. He
had felt a certain remorse over Batson’s
case; but business was business. This
enginedriver or whatever he Avas had paid a
deposit on the house, and then had mortgaged
his furniture to meet interest payments.
Finally he had let the house go. First and
last Batson had contributed £4OO towards
the financial strength of Salesby, in addi-
tion to which Salesby had got the house
again, while Batson was still bound to him
by the mortgage over his furniture.
The man had kicked, of course—most of
them did. Only a few weeks ago he had
written a letter claiming that he had more
than paid what he owed, and demanding a
full release. - But if Salesby had been accus-
tomed to notice such letters he would not
have been the wealthy man he was. He
had acted within his legal rights, and, any-
way, he had treated Batson very consider-
ately, Ignoring the latter’s implied threats,
he had written to Batson informing him
that grace would be given—the outstanding
payments to be added to the capital debt
according to the terms of the agreement.
That clause—his own drafting—had pleased
Salesby immensely. It was an ingenious
way of charging enormous interest in a per-
fectly legitimate fashion. He did not mind
how long the principal lent to a man in Bat-
son’s position—in regular employment and
get-at-able if he failed to meet his obliga-
tions —was unpaid, so long as the interest
was met.
And now there was this accursed engine.
At night he dreamt about it—muddled dreams
of children sobbing in hunger, of a weeping
woman and a grim-faced, hard-lipped man
with eyes flaming with hatred, who was
suddenly part of an engine which leapt the
rails and dashed after him as he ran with
clogged feet, breaking, with what sounded
like roars of triumph, through walls behind
which he had sought refuge.
At breakfast his wife asked him what he
had meant by crying out that he would let
Batson go. She told him, as a queer thing,
that afterwards he had slept quite calmly.
But he was sane by that time—sane
enough to make up his mind to take a holi-
day ; too sane to do anything so foolish as
throw away the money that Batson owed
him.
* * * *
A strange apprehension haunted him from
the minute he stepped into the mountain-
bound train; and at once his eyes were
straining from the window for a sight of
the engine he dreaded. In the ordinary
course of things it would not be in evidence.
But it was.
Its appearance caused his heart to contract
icily. Yet he felt oddly relieved. He tried
to get a glimpse of its crew, but they were
crouching in the cab, out of sight. Were
they biding from him intentionally? He
fixed his eyes on the passing scenery and his
thoughts ran: “A pretty hill, nice place
for a holiday camp. 1062. 1062. Damn it,
can’t I get away from that? I must! I
wonder where that gully ends. Batson.”
Always the two things came back together:
“Batson —1062 ; 1062 —Batson.”
He was still fighting this tangle of thought
when he reached the little country town
he had chosen because an old friend lived
in the district. The friend came heartily to
meet him, but in the very act of extending his
hand Salesby paused, and staggered.
An engine had passed on the other side of
the platform; and its number was 1062.
“You’re ill!” exclaimed Clayton, anxiously.
“Good God, man, you’re as white as a ghost!
You’ve been overdoing it.”
“Yes, I’m ill,” said Salesby, brokenly. “I
feel all in—done. There’s a letter I want to
write—a letter I must write. A letter”
He was still muttering about writing a
letter when they reached Karragandi home-
stead, and he was so strangely insistent
about it that, after pouring another nip of
whisky into him —they had had some in the
township—Clayton set him at his desk.
When he came back, Salesby was sitting with
a sealed letter in his hand, his cheque-
book on the table, and a glassy stare in his
eye.
“Clayton, I want this letter sent without
delay. Could you get somebody”
“Why, certainly, I’ll get”
“Be sure it goes,” pleaded Salesby; and
then he rose, and, rising, he swayed, thrust-
ing his arms out as though pushing away
walls that were falling over him. and crashed
to the ground before Clayton could catch hup.
Consciousness returned to Salesby with an
imperative thought that he must return home.
Clayton protested, but was overborne, an<k
after a nightmare race through the darkness,
Salesby reached the station in time to drop
into a compartment of a small mixed train
which was just leaving.

"I am a Rexona Girl, for I always

lent for the skin and hair.’'
Miss LEXIE PARKER,

North Sydney, N.S.tV.
Be a
Rexoaa Girl!
It Means Health
and Beauty.
Rexona Girls are world-famous
for their beautiful skin and hair.
To be a Rexona Girl is to use only
Rexona Soap and enjoy that
natural beauty of the skin and hair
which cannot be imitated, but can
be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not
assert this influence. Many of
them contain free alkali, which
tends to dry the skin and destroy
its delicate texture. Even tin*
best of such soaps can only
cleanse, they cannot heal and
protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the
same soothing, healing antisep-
tic balsams as Rexona, the y
Rapid Healer, the value of
which in the treatment of
skin affections is known
throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin
and Facial Soap regularly
once or twice a day, and see if it does not
quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen
the tendency to pimples, and leave the
complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

As the train moved out Salesby heard the
panting of an approaching engine. Affright-
edl.v he pressed his face against the window
and looked out into the night. A shadow
loomed up and Salesby saw distinctly the
number 1062 on the engine that seemed to
slip past. But he saw more. He
saw the face of the enginedriver, pale
in the moonlight, and it was the face of
Batson ! Of Batson, who glared with mani-
acal ferocity upon him, and whose arm was
extended towards him in a threatening ges-
ture! The vision passed in a flash, yet
Salesby heard what the lunatic had shouted
at him, in a voice that drowned the roar of
the train: “I’ll get you now!”
The train jolted over the points that took
it on to the long single line, and gathered
speed. Salesby’s heart thudded in an agony
of terror as he let down the window and
looked backward. The line was straight
and he could see nothing. Shortly, however,
there came a bend and he saw, halt a mi e
away, or perhaps more, an engine tearing
through the night in pursuit ot them.
In a moment he knew that Batson intended
to crash into the mixed train from behind.
Getting clear of the points had delayed him;
but now he was coming at a tearful speed
and Salesby gritted lus teeth for e
crash. The driver of the mixed train ai
peared also to have seen the engine and the
Sanger. The fleet.? engine taped forward

How William Made Reparation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BEFORE he was born his mother,
already the possessor of three sons,
decided to call him Elizabeth May.
He was to be the means of developing in his
brothers a spirit of chivalry towards the
opposite sex, a spirit which in liis mother »
opinion was in danger of dying out. By his
gentle, winning ways he was to curb the
domineering nature of the male, which had
already manifested itself in his brothers,
even though in years none of them had
reached double figures. He was to inherit
his mother’s beauty ; to be a lovely peg on
which to hang pretty clothes. His eyes were
to be blue, which color predominated in his
Uatal trousseau. He was to marry for love,
but in a social sphere higher than the one
wherein he was born. Ilis husband was
to be a model of perfection. All these plans
she kept secret, though she made no mystery
of the bald fact that she wanted a daughter.
When his perfidy was made manifest his
mother was confounded. Her visions lay
shattered. She thought all her hopes died
with his birth. She scarcely glanced at him
as he lay in the dainty blue cradle that really
belonged to Elizabeth May. When he howled
lustily she thought there was a note of tri-
umph in his voice. His trousseau had to be
altered. The salvation of his brothers must
necessarily be indefinitely postponed. His
eyes were brown, he was plain like his father.
Elizabeth May had to be returned to the list
of names from which it had been secretly
extracted, and, thoroughly disheartened, she
told his father that he could call “it” what
he liked. “William” being the first eligible
name that entered the paternal head, William
the child became, and howled protestingly
when the parson presented it with a splash
of cold water.
Though his mother’s conscience would not
permit her to do anything less than her
maternal duty, a practical note dominated
the relationship, which did not give a hint of
what might have been had William not been
William. As she packed away blue bows
in lavender-scented boxes, she felt she was
attending thp obsequies of Elizabeth May,
and wept. Having behaved badly from birth,
William was not considered eligible for a
pet or eVen an abbreviated name, so he re-
mained William through whooping-cough,
mumps, measles and sundry other infectious
diseases, for at a tender age he showed a
weakness for collecting germs. The cutting
of his first tooth was scarcely celebrated at
all, except by himself; and when his mother
pessimistically forecasted an awful time for
everybody when he reached his “doubles,” he
again confounded her by growing them much
more peacefully than any of his brothers had
done. After he realised his possession of
legs, she said she supposed he’d upset every-
thing, including the almost sacred family
cat, but he astonished her by being even more
exemplary than Elizabeth May might have
been had she accepted her invitation.
The steadying influence of an unabbrevi-
ated name may have been responsible, but
whatever the cause there was no doubt that
William was a well-behaved child, who,
though unable, really through no fault of his
own, to exert that feminine, influence on
which his mother had counted, was neverthe-
less a good example to his brothers. Being
correspondingly unpopular, one of them was
heard to declare that he ought to be a parson.
The idea of the cloth entered his mother’s
head, and in future a fraction of the en-
thusiasm that would have been Elizabeth
May’s belonged to her usurper, William.
When he earned a scholarship which took
him to a public school, his mother let the
headmaster know that William was destined
for the Church, and throughout his scholastic
career his teachers and family thought him
indelibly stamped with theology. lie, being
a silent and unobtrusive person did not con-
tradict them. His father, who considered the
Church right enough for some sort of men
(including William), accepted the general
verdict, and hoped that his son would preach
a better sermon than the one he was forced
to listen to every Sunday morning. William
hoped so, too, and jogged contentedly along
the path that was supposed to lead to a
pulpit.
He had a hobby which displeased his
mother—inseets. He collected them, all
shapes, sizes and descriptions, venomous and
otherwise, colored and plain, mentionable and
unmentionable. Two by two they paraded
on pins up and down his specimen cases,
whose odor discouraged the presence of their
animate and hungry relations, and they were
labelled with incomprehensible names, appa-
rently on a system of the smaller the insect
the larger the name. While his brothers in-
dulged in s.uch lawful occupations as football
matches and moving pictures, William passed
his time in quest of entomological knowledge.
His mother couldn’t conceive from whom he
inherited this kink; but, as he had been fond
of germs from babyhood, and showed no ani-
mosity towards liis ultimate career, she
accepted his idiocyncrasy as part of his
shortcomings, and, taking time by the fore-
lock, chose the text of his first sermon.
Imagine her state of mind when on leav-
ing school he quietly announced that he had
no intention of becoming a candidate for theo-
logical honors, having made up his mind to
stick to entomology. His mother was dumb-
founded. In vain his father explained it was
merely a difference in ’ologies. When at last
she recovered her powers of speech, she asked
him how he expected to make a living out of
insects, which, of course, were not nearly so
respectable as theology. He had no satisfac-
tory answer. It was useless for his friend
to assure her that Charles Darwin, who had
given up theology for entomology, had be-
come as famous as the most famous divine
the world had ever known. The perturbed
lady could only regard her son’s behavior as
infamous. Hadn’t he offended sufficiently by
being himself, she argued in camera, without
becoming what he said he was going to be?
Secretly she had hoped that as a divine he
might marry some Elizabeth May; but hov
could such an exalted person be expected to
wed an impecunious insect man? Once more
William endorsed his early unpopularity.
Resignation came with the passing of time,
and when the last of William's brothers took
a wife, his mother decided that, after all, if
was as well to have a freak in the family, •
for he was much too engrossed with his in-
sects to think of girls (besides, what girl
would think of him?), and the house would
be strange without a son of any kind. He
gave little trouble, and, poked away in bis
den with crawling things which would never
crawl again—that was the only blessing she
could ever see in entomology—be bent, micro-
scope in hand, over infinitesimal specks with
prodigious names. Yes, it was handy to have
a bachelor in the family, now that father
wasn’t so agile as he used to be and burglars
were prevalent.
When the burglar scare was at its height
William, without any warning, announced
his intention to marry.
A bombshell couldn’t have created more
chaos in the maternal mind. At first she was
wordless; then questions tumbled over
one another. What was his fiancee's name,
where did she live, what was she like? Her
name, he said, was Elizabeth. Elizabeth/
Yes, Elizabeth May, and though lie went on
to relate her surname and that she lived in
Queensland, that he had met her on one of
his entomological excursions, that she was
beautiful and had blue eyes, his mother heard
not a word. Softly she was saying to her-
self, “Elizabeth May, Elizabeth May,” and,
had he not been so engrossed with his theme,
he would have wondered why her lips moved
and her eyes gazed so wistfully at some vision
behind him. ,
Steeling herself against the hope he had
wounded so badly when he came into the
world, and stabbed again when he turned
down theology, she told herself that his wife
would be like the other boys’ wives—a modern
miss with decided opinions, unfeminine tastes
and manners, and no time for old people.
She would take away a son without giving a
daughter—the daughter for whom all her life
she had longed. The old grudge against
William hardened. How dare be marry a
wife with such a name! She felt as though
her very own Elizabeth May had once lived,
and that he was desecrating that pure
memory by marrying this usurper.
On the day William came home with his
bride his mother stood like a sentinel to re-
ceive them on the verandah of the new home.
With the sunlight on her face, she looked
grim and forbidding. He felt his young
wife’s hand tighten on his arm, and then its
swift withdrawal. Eager yet shy, and radiat-
ing the spirit of the bright Spring morn-
ing, she walked with outstretched lends
towards the stern old woman who made a
grey, lonely column in the sunlight.
“I have no mother,” she faltered, “will
you”
But she never finished her sentence, tor
with a hungry cry of “Elizabeth May!” the
old woman took her to her heart.
And that was how William made repara-
tion.

A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-railway guard, 749 Harris
Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the effect
in the small of my back. For three solid months I was unable
to work, and was laid up. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who recom-
mended Turkish baths; but, though I got a little ease, I could
not work. I used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and obtained
wonderful relief; in fact, so much so that I can now do heavy
work. I am fully convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are a true Kidney remedy, and I never fail to recommend
them among my friends.”
Twenty years later Mr. Carroll says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and by taking them now and again I keep
in splendid health.”

Mrs. M. Whitbread, sen., “Amherst,” Napoleon Street,
Mascot, Sydney, says:—“For years I suffered terribly from
backache and kidney trouble, and was at times so ill that i naa
to lie up for days. My back ached terribly, and I was almost
crippled with the ailment, every movement making the pain
worse. My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and 1 knev
this was a sign of dropsy. I also had trouble with the secre-
tions, was subject to dizziness, and felt tired and languid. t
was really far from well, and having seen Doan s Backacne
Kidney Pills advertised at different times, it at last occurred to
me to try this remedy. I got some, and it proved a messing,
giving quick relief, and gradually effected a perfect cure. 1 teei
splendid now, and have only Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to
thank for my wonderful recovery.”
Two years later Mrs. Whitbread says:—“My cure has
proved a permanent one, no sign of kidney trouble hating
returned since Doan’s Pills cured me over two years ago.

Whatever Happens
in regard to welfare take it calmly.
Whether you come into a FORTUNE, win the
CALCUTTA SWEEP, or walk off with the
BEAUTY PRIZE, keep a level head.
Whether you have sunk GOOD MONEY in BAD
MARKS, in a COLOSSAL SWINDLE or get away
with the BOOBY PRIZE, don’t be downhearted.
Whatever happens in regard to health always demands
early and careful consideration.
Without good health good fortune loses half its value ;
depression is doubled when bad luck is encountered.
Well! there is nothing more suitable than Beecham’s
Pills when you are out of sorts, liverish, languid and
depressed, when appetite is fickle, digestion upset,
and the system requires purifying and toning up.
Why! the universal popularity and enormous sale of
this specific is alone convincing testimony to its
genuine worth.
