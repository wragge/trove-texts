THE RED PAGE.
Kipling’s new book of ballads does not heighten
his reputation, bub confirms it. We know now
just what to expect from this bright writer—he
has reached the limits of his powers in prose and
verse, and, could he do more, would be no longer
Kipling. London Times, with not unusual
infelicity, declared that unmistakeable genius
rang in every line of the Barrack-Room Ballads.
There is not a trace of genius in Kipling:
his supremacy is clearly that of talent.
He works on ordinary lines ; and by dint of his
instinct for a good thing, and his knack of saying
it, and his industry in getting their utmost pos-
sible value out of knack and instinct, he has
managed to go just a little farther on those
ordinary lines than the previously best workers of
his kind. Genius generally develops on ex-
traordinary lines : its outlook differs from
that of talent not so much in extent as in di-
rection. Of the same ballads the Pall Mall
Gazette asked: “ If this be not poetry, what
is?” shirking dictum in interrogative. But
Kipling’s verse is not poetry in any exalted
sense beoause it is almost entirely lacking in
imagination. He never gives to airy nothing a
local habitation and a name. What he does is to
find _ forcible expression and comfortable verbal
lodging for solid something. He is not creator,
hut interpreter.
* . ■ • •„ *
The splendid lines, “ M'Andrews’ Hymn,”
for example, in the new volume —on the whole
the <best thing Kipling has done in verse—are
decidedly not poetry. And why not ? Because
there is no intoxication about them, no frenzy:
the pythoness is always watching the audience
out of the corner of her eye : is always master
of her oracle. Nobody can be a poet till the
oracle masters aim. And Kipling’s verses,
too, want ideality : they have no direct refer-
ence to abstract questions, universal emotions:
their soope is narrow, their standpoint apart. It
is doubtless this very isolation which gives them
truth and intensity : they are wonderfully real
and living; but their life, their reality remain
always things outside the reader. So throughout
Kipling. You feel that he is always writing
about other people—never about yon. You can ad-
mire him, be interested in them, yet he and they
are aliens all the time. It is not so with
a poet. The magic of poetry is potent in
proportion as the reader can identify himself with
the thoughts and emotions expressed. It is the
broad human appeal that glorifies it. Kipling,
like other realists, can only get narrow individual
appeal. And, though this is often marvellously
strong, it is never of the strongest. To any fel-
low, the other fellow can never be quite as impor-
tant as this fellow.
« • * *
The new ballads seem mostly reprinted, and are
padded with a good deal of dull stuff. The long
“Song of the English,” whioh begins the volume, is
heavy—a failure. But there are quite enough gems
to make the book’s fortune, and it is permissible
to quote one or two which bring to mind the state-
ment of Kipling’s old Indian editor that he wrote
his rhymes to airs humming in his head. Isn’t
there a fine swing in this ?—
THE LAST CHANTEY.
' And there was no more aea.’
Thus said The Lord in the Vault above the Cherubim,
Calling to the Angels and the Souls in their degree:
. ' Lo! Earth has passed away
On the smoke of Judgment Day.
That Our word may be established shall we gather up
the sea 1 ‘
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners:
* Plague upon the hurrioane that made us furl and flee!
But the war is done between us,
In the deep the Lord hath seen us—
Our bones we’ll leave the barracout’, and God may sink
the sea 1 *
Then said the soul of Judas that betrayed him:
' Lord, hast Thou forgotten Thy oovenant with met
Haw once a year I go
To cool me on the floe T
And Ye take my day of mercy if Ye take away the seal *
Then said the soul of the Angel of the Off-shore Wind
(He that bits the thunder when the bull-mouthed
breakers flee):
‘ I have watch and ward to keep
O’er Thy wonders on the deep,
And Ye take mine honor from me if Ye take away the
sea ! ’
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners :
‘ Nay, but we were angry, and a hasty folk are wet
If we worked the ship together
Till she foundered in foul weather,
Are we babes that we should clamor for a vengeance on
the sea ? ’
Theu said the souls of the slaves that men threw over-
board :
' Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we;
But Thy arm was strong to save ;
And it touched us on the wave,
And we drowsed the long tides idle till Thy Trumpets
tore the sea.’
Then cried the soul of the stout Apostle Paul to God:
‘Once we frapped a ship, and she laboured wouudily.
There were fourteen score of these,
And they blessed Thee on their knees,
When they learned Thy Grace and Glory under Malta by
the sea I ’
Loud sane the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,
Plucking at their harps, and they plucked unhandily:
‘Our thumbs are rough and tarred,
And the tune is something hard— -
May wc lift a Deepsea Chantey such as seamen use at
sea?’
Then said the souls of the gentlemen-adventurers—
Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity :
‘ Ho, we revel in our chains
O’er the sorrow that was Spain’*;
Heave or sink it, leave or drink it, we were masters of
the sea! ’
Up spake the soul of a gray Gothavn ’speckshioner
(He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee):
‘ Oh, the ice-blink white and near,
And the bowhead breaching clear !
Will Ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in
the sea?’
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,
Crying : ‘ Under Heaven, here is neither lead nor lea I
Must we sing for evermore
On the windless, glassy floor?
Take baok your golden fiddles and we'll beat to open
sea 1 ’
Then stooped the Lord, and He oalled the good sea np to
Him,
And ’stablished his borders unto all eternity,
That'„uch as have no pleasure
For to praise the Lord by measure,
They may enter into galleons and serve Him on the sea.
Sun, wind, and cloud shall not fail from the face of it,
Stinging, ringing spindrift, nor the fulmar flying
free ;
And the ships shall go abroad
To the Qlory of the Lord,
Who heard the silly sailor folk and gave thorn hack
their sea 1
• • • •
In the first version of this lines 3 and 4 of verse
10 ran—
‘Oh, the ringer and right whale,
And the fish were struck for sale.’
Kipling has got a trifle more technical slang in,
after his effective habit, to increase the reality of
the picture; and perhaps also he thought the
“sale” idea objectionable. It does not seem
necessary to know exactly what a ’speckshioner
is, if you classify him dimly as one of the para-
sites of the whale.
• * • *
And here is another haunting rhythm: his
music nearly doubles the value of muoh of Kip-
ling’s verse—
‘ FOLLOW ME ’OME.’
There was no one like ’im, ’Orse or Foot,
Nor any o’ the Guns I knew ;
An’ because it was so, why, o’ course ’e went an’ died,
Which is just what the best men do.
So it's knock out your pipes an’ follow me !
An' it's finish up your swipes an' follow me !
Oh, ‘ark to the big drum callin’,
Follow me—follow me ’ome l
ffl mare she neighs the ’ole day long,
She paws the 'ole night through,
An’ she won't take ’or feed ’cause o’ waitin’ for ’is step,
Which is just what a beast would do.
'ls girl she goes with a bombardier
Before 'er month is through ;
An’ the. banns are up in ohurch, for she’s got the beggar
hooked,
Whioh is Just what a girl would do.
We fought ’bout a dog—last week it were—
No more than a round or two ;
But I strook ’im cruel 'ard, an’ I wish I ’adn’t new,
Which is just what a man can’t do.
‘E was all that I ’ad in the way of a friend,
An’ I’ve ’ad to find one new ;
But I’d give my pay an’ stripe to get the beggar book,
Which it’s just too late to do.
So it’s knock out your pipes an’ follow me !
An' it's finish off your swipes an’ follow me l
Oh, 'ark to the fifes a-crawlin’ l
Follow me—follow me 'ome 1
Take ’im away ! 'E's gone where the best men go.
Take 'im away I An' the gun-wheels turnin' slow.
Take ’im away ! There’s more from the place ‘e come.
Take ’im away, with the limber an' the drum.
For it's ‘ Three rounds blank ’ an’follow me,
An, it's ‘ Thirteen rank ’ an’ follow me;
Oh, passin’ the love o’ women,
Follow me—follow me ’ome I
There are several other pieces as good or all but.
The book is sprinkled with vigorous sketches
by an aboriginal artist—hailing apparently from
N.S. Wales, but his name and lineage are not
given. One would like to learn them, for his
work is most interesting. Andrew Lang intro-
duces the stories with a short note which success-
fully disguises a good deal of ignorance of their
authors, though scraps of Marcus Clarke’s Gor-
don-prefaoe reappear effectively. And, for
tasting, the Noongahburrahs and Mrs. Parker
and the anonymous artist are herewith palatably
represented—
' In the morning, Bibbee would come over to her oamp
and ask her what was the matter that she had called
out so in the night. She told him that she thought she
heard someone walking about and was afraid, for she was
alone with her four little girls.
He told her she ought not to be afraid with all her
ohildren round her. But night after night she sat up
crying: “ Wyah, wyah, Deereeree, Deereeree."
At last Bibbee said : “If you are so frightened, marry
me and live in my oamp. I will take care of you.” But
Deereeree said she did not want to marry. So night after
night was to be heard her plaintive cry of “ Wyah, wyah,
Deereeree, Deereeree." And again and again Bibbee
pressed her to share his oamp and marry him. But she
always refused. The more she refused the more he
wished to marry her. And he used to wonder how he
could induce her to ohange her mind.
At last he thought of a plan of surprising her into giv-
ing her consent. He set to work and made a beautiful
and many-colored arch, which, when it was made, he
called Euloowirree, and he placed it right across the sky,
reaching from one side of the earth to the other. When
the rainbow was firmly placed in the sky and showing out
in all its brilliancy of many colors, as a roadway from the
earth to the stars, Bibbee went into his camp to wait.
When Deereeree looked up at the sky and saw the won-
derful rainbow', she thought something dreadful must be
going to happen. She was terribly frightened, and called
aloud: “Wyah, wyah.” In her fear she gathered her
ohildren together, and fled with them to Bibbee’s camp
for protection.
Bibbee proudly told her that he had made the rainbow,
Just to show how strong he was and how safe she would
be if she married him. But if she would not, ahe would
see what terrible things he would make to come on the
earth, not just a harmless and beautiful roadway across
the heavens, but things that would burst from the earth'
and destroy it.
So, by working on her mixed feelings of fear of his
prowess and admiration of his skill, Bibbee gained his
desire and Deereeree married him. And when long after-
wards they died, Deereeree was changed into the little
willy-wagtail who may be heard through the stillness of
the summer nights, crying her plaintive wail of “ Deeree-
ree, wyah, wyah, Deereeree."
And Bibbee was changed into the « oodpecker, or elimb-
ing tree bird, who is always running up trees as if he
wanted to be building other ways to the sky than the
famous roadway of lii» Kuloowirree, the building of which
had wo him hi 3 wife.
♦ 7~
Hubert Crackanthorpe, the young English
writer whose body was the other day found in
the Seine—murder or suicide?—was the clever
son of a clever mother. He wrote prose stories
and sketches, half-realist, half-symbolist, which
were often very striking. Decidedly he promised
well, but his nerves vibrated too keenly for health :
the modern melancholy suffuses all his work.
Ho was very sensitive to sex : the relations of
men and women are the theme of nearly all his
magazine contributions. “Wreckage” and
“Sentimental Studies ” —two volumes of collected
fragments—sold in small editions : there was an
earlier volume, “A Set of Village Tales' 1 ; and
his “Vignettes,” a few small leaves of impres-
sions, reached Australia some fortnighb ago.
These are of them—
PARIS IN OCTOBER.
Paris in October—all white and a-glitter tinder a cold,
sparkling sky, and the trees of the houlevards trembling
their frail, russet leaves ; garish, petulant Paris ; com-
placently content with her sauntering crowds, her mono-
tonous arrangements in pink and white and blue ; ever
busied with her own publicity, her tiresome, obvious
vice, and her paroohial modernity coquetting with cos-
mopolitanism . . .
IN THE BAY OP SALERNO.
To gaze across the block sweep of sea, out into the
mystery of the night; to hear the restless waves slowly
sighing through the darkness, as they beat ths rocks a
thousand feet beneath ; to love a little so, with quiet
pressure of hands; and listlessly to ponder on strange
meanings of life and love and death.
And so, amid a still serenity of dreamy sadness, to
forget the tnad turmoil of passion, to grow indifferent to
all desire, and to wait, while the heart fills full of grave
gratitude towards an unknown God.
And then, once more, to understand how life is but a
little thing, and love but ft passionate illusion, and to
envy the sea her sighing in the day when the c r d shall
have come.
* * * •
Despondent enough—likely it was suicide. One
acknowledges a real grief for Craokanthorpe—not
that he is worse off, or we better—but he was an
intellectual comrade, and these are rare. Grief is
one of the joys of egoistn, apparently.
Some items —
" Mr. Coulson Kernahan is one of those Irishmen of
genius whose imagination and powers of expression are
out of all proportion to their logical and intellectual
faculties.”— Freethinker, . . Armand Jerome, whilom
editor of the dead-in-life Cosmos, pleaded in mitigation
of sentence for embezzlement that “he wanted to do
something in art and literature that would put him above
the ordinary level of his fellow-men.” That was what
he wanted to do. What he did do was to pay Faveno
and others a few shillings for articles which he published
over his own signature. He even had the impu-
dence to ask Louise Mack to write a story to
be issued as written by Armand Jerome. . . .
Olive Schreiner, who does her own cooking, has had a
new book in the kitchen-table drawer for several years
past, so they say, and ponders corrections while waiting
for the joint to “do on top”. Satisfied at last that she
cannot better.it, she will bring it to England for publica-
tion in ’97— so they say. . . . “ The public oriticism of
fiction, as distinguished from the reviewing of books for
purposes of advertisement, should be primarily the court
of appeal from the popular judgment. Therein the con-
scientious writer should find the consolation for his hard-
won failure, and the successful impostor the end of hie
complacency.”— Saturday Review. ... He Louie
Sixteenth’s brutality, “L.M.F.” quotes for Lond. Spec-
tator a paragraph in the diary of Gouverneur Morris,
American Ambassador during the Reign of Terror in Paris
—“M. de Trudaine mentioned as having heard from
young Montmorin that the King is by nature cruel and
base. An instance of his cruelty, among others, is that
he used to spit and roast live cats. In riding with
Madame Flahaut, I tell her that I could not believe such
things. She tells me that when young he was guilty of
such things; that he is very brutal and nasty, whioh she
attributes chiefly to a bad education. His brutality
once led him so far, while Dauphin, as to beat his wife,
for which he was exiled four days by his grandfather,
Louis XV.”
Mrs. K. Langloh Parker’s “ Australian Legen-
dary Tales ” have ethnologioally little signifi-
cance, and seem to have been invented at a com-
paratively recent date. The Noongahburrahs are
evidently as happy in thoughtlessness as all their
kindred, and do not, so far as Mrs. Parker shows,
pose themselves with the deeper problems of exist-
ence. Life and death and the hereafter they take
for granted: their tales are imaginative attempts to
account for the obvious natural phenomena thrust
daily under their noses—the characteristics of
beasts, the cries of birds, the origin of fire. The
intrinsic interest is sight; though three or four of
the stories—“The Bunbundoolooeys,” “Weedah
the Mocking Bird,” “ Meamei the Seven Sisters,”
‘ Deegeenboyah the Soldier Bird’’—have suf-
ficiently dramatio action to hold a reader’s atten-
tion. The undoubted value of the whole collection
is chiefly that of a literary curiosity—the pratt-
lings of our Australia’s children, which even in
their worthlessness must have charm for a parent.
DEEREEREE THE WAGTAIL, AND THE RAINBOW.
Deereeree was a widow, and lived in a oamp alone with
her four little girls. One day Bibbee came and made a
camp not far from hers. Deereeree was frightened of
him, too frightened to go to sleep. All night she used to
watch his camp, and if she heard a sound she would cry
aloud: “Deereeree, wyah, wyah, Deereeree.” Some-
times she would be calling out nearly all night.

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emi-
nence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Oollins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed in an
acute or chronic case of long standing, where other physicians
have failed. He addresses himself in particular to cases that
have baffled the skill and science of other doctors. His name
is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he
undertakes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to your
life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best friend
and benefactor. If you are troubled with want of sleep, a
tired gloomy feeling, and loss of energy, which impair both
your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you for study,
business, or the proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering
from these or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before
it is everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat it
with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching back
and kidnevs, loss of mental and physical power and vigor,
and not unfrequently accompanied by an impairment of the
general health. In justice to this celebrated specialist it can
be truthfully stated that in all such cases of middle-aged
men, as well of young men, his success has been almost
invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female complaints,
liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder, kidney and heart
disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele and kidney troubles.

Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men
who suffer from any of the following symptoms,
namely : —Frequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
and feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all SPECIAL DISEASES
may be quickly and permanently CURED,
without loss of time and money. This book
will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for REMEDIES
NECESSARY FOR THE CURE,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
D Ft. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send fid. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none bub the very purest
remedies.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

. XMAS SHOW .
(HAYMARKET ONLY).
MEMO, for SHOPPERS, more particularly of
the LATE VARIETIES. It is our intention to
close our establishment at ONE O’CLOCK on
SATURDAYS, from January 1, 1897.
Did you ever read about OLD SCROOGE and
the XMAS CAROL?
What was OLD SCROOGE like before he saw
MARLEY’S GHOST ? A miserable wretch,
begrudging a starving cur a lick out of the gutter,
the children their Xmas feast, and all mankind its
Xmas enjoyment.
What would you be like if you didn’t see
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
XMAS SHOW.
Not so bad as OLD SCROOGE, surely, for he
was a bad case indeed. But you would not, nay,
could not, be happy. Your heart would yearn
for something, and you wouldn’t know what. You
would be low-spirited, snappish, and bilious. There
would be no brightness in your eye, no elasticity
in your step, your weary feet would be heavy as
lead, your flesh would fall away, and instead of
the sleek, WELL-GROOMED CITIZEN, a lean,
woebegone, CADAVEROUS PANTALOON
would OCCUPY YOUR PANTS and wear your
skin. Friend, don’t risk it, make a point of seeing

The Laws of the Sevang.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The East had tugged my heart-strings, and I
stepped aboard the mail,
wk iere the etiquette is like the ship—of steel,
Where there’s laws and regulations quite enough
to run a gaol,
And the nine Commandments pasted on the
wheel.
The master of the naval skip—his cap is bound in
brass—
The airs he gives himself give us a pang,
And his whole existence says to you: “ Young
man, keep off the grass !
And abide by all the laws of the Serang ! ”
That is to say :
“ If you travel in the first saloon,
Sahib ! you mustn’t spit in the spittoon;
Smoking ain’t allowed where there is a crowd.
Whether in the Bight or off Rangoon,
Whisper not the cursed words, ‘Damn ’ or ‘Dang,’
On our line ’twixt Plymouth and Penang
We’re the P. &O. ! Salaam, Sahib. Lo !
Listen to the laws of the Serang ! ”
So we let old Breaksea Island and the Sound go
down astern,
And we formed a little party and a school,
And, next day being Sunday, we all sat down to
learn
How to ring a grey with fivers in the pool.
And a blasted greasy nigger “Salaam Sahibed ”
us all to cease
When the game was just becoming warm and
strong,
Though we “ hooshtahed ” him he entered caveats
against our lease,
And jumped it with the law of the Ser-ong.
Which also remarks :
“ Sahib, you musn’t shake the nimble dice—
Musn’t take the risk of nary pice—
Throw the bones away—’tis the Sabbath day
(The Cabin-Service ladies all are nice) —
Dinner dress includes a mile of shirt—
Sahib ! secure a drawl and take a flirt
Leeways on the longboat—but this ain’t no wicked
songboat—
Assume the British air or we’ll feel hurt.”
They’ve a menu of French grammar, and some
tough old ewe, to eat,-
And the British girl reduced to skin and bone
Wears an opera-dress and clothes not much above
her blessed feet,
And glories in her nudity alone ;
And next her is the English dude whose waist is
twenty-one,
And whose brains could make a passage through
a ring,
And the fleshless nudity and he damn all beneath
the sun,
’Cept the Empire which is run by the Ser -ing.
Who furthermore states :
“ ‘ Pied a mouton —sauce a la piquant,’
Blast your lack of French and the hongtong,
Call it ‘ mutton trotter ” and our British brain will
totter —
We’re all British—are we Lascars and Ser -O'ag 1
Though the space of three-feet-six by four-feet-
four
And some stinks will serve to lodge of us a score,
We’re all British, and we’re royal,
In our rupee way we’re loyal
To Queen Vicky from the Largs to Mirzapore.
There’s not a bite of fresh meat to be had for love
or money—
Only ’Murkan beef grown tasteless in the ice—
And they give you a French menu, and they
think it very funny
If you don’t say “ Tray hiong. By God, it’s
nice ! ”
They give you a French menu, and a bony British
lady
Dressed like a living picture to the waist,
And a dude who’s exiled from St. James’s for
doing something shady,
And who damns what he’s not seen with British
taste.
The bar’s the only winner—there’s a loss on the
French dinner—
But they’re English, thank you, though it gives
a pang !
And all manly thoughts they muffle under cere-
monial snuffle,
And they’re guided by the laws of the Serang.
Who says conclusively :
Sahib ! I’m Moosa Khan !
Sahib ! I’m British man !
Fork me out a dollar for I filled your water-can,
Whisper not the curse words “damn” or “ dang,”
Tip and tip ’twixt Plymouth and Penang ;
Wear your mile of shirt,
Have your longboat flirt :
These are all the laws of the Serang !
In the Bight.

Dear Bulletin, —I am interested in the
subject of cannibalism. My memory retains an
inkling of having read somewhere that cannibalism
survived in Scotland till the days of good Queen
Bess, about whose time a peeress (Loudon, I
fancy) was tried for child-eating. Can anyone
named M‘Pherson give me a finger-post to reach
the source of that inkling?—Yours, &c., X.Z.

The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Xuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d. !! —win at first no doubt

SATURDAY, JANUARY 9, 1897.
A Year’s Record.
New South Wales, the province where the
fiscal issue rages without ceasing and the
tariff disagreement is never wholly at rest,
has reached the end of the first year of the
new Foreign-trade epoch, and a great
attempt is being made by the party which is
responsible for the consequences to favorably
size up results. So far the most conspicuous
fact is that there are hardly any results
worth mentioning, and very few that are not
best buried in oblivion. The absolute
Foreign-trade policy didn’t infest New South
Wales for the whole of 1896, but the great
bulk of the protective duties were removed
on the first day of the year, and some more
at the commencement of July ; and the very
few remaining duties which it is proposed to
sacrifice are departing by instalments ; so
1896 may fairly be called a year of Foreign-
trade. And on the whole it has been a year
of lost hopes and of aspirations that didn’t
come off; and “the Depression” which was
to have lifted has rather settled down with
renewed intensity. The same historical de-
pression is heard of more or less from all
parts of the world ; it has apparently become
one of the permanent concomitants of civili-
sation, and its causes seem to be too many
for present enumeration. But in New South
Wales, through much worrying of the weary
fiscal issue, it has grown to be almost a fixed
belief with one large section of the popula-
tion that Foreign-trade is in itself an abso-
lute cufe for the whole trouble, while
another large section believes that every-
thing can be put right by Protection. The
province had some 50 years of Foreign-
trade, and during that time the depression
came periodically just as usual. Neverthe-
less during the semi-protective Dibbs regime
the party prophesied the great things which
its nostrum would bring to pass, if it
only had a trial, just as if it hadn’t
been already tried more or less for half a
century with no results worth mentioning.
And now another year’s trial has also pro-
duced no results worth mentioning, never-
theless the same old prophecy goes on as
vigorously as ever.
* * * *
The one experiment which New South
Wales made in the way of Protection also
produced no very large or beautiful conse-
quences. Nevertheless, as Foreign-trade
had more than fifty years’ run and failed de-
finitely, whereas Protection had only a hal -
hearted trial for three years and hadn t time
to fail definitely, the conclusion is that
Foreign-trade is much the worse failure of
the two. The evidence is that half-a-century
or more of Foreign-trade resulted in nothing
but depression and disappointment ; while
there is no evidence that half-a-century of
Protection would have done anything of the
kind, because the experiment hasn’t yet been
tried. This time Foreign-trade came in with
a louder, wilder, madder whoop of exultation
than ever. Premier Reid asserted that his
fiscal creed would abolish the unemployed in
24 hours, or some other very brief period.
It was announced on all hands that the
country was “ saved ” —it had been “ saved
so often before that the statement seemed
rather less reliable than it might be, but
anyhow it was saved once more. And at the
present moment the country looks exactly
the same as it did in the days when it was
lost. Considering all the hopes that were
raised and the promises that were made, this
is a saddening result.
» • » *
There are as yet very few data to go upon
as to the condition of things in 1896. It is
known from the reports of Sydney Benevo-
lent Asylum and other charities that the
general destitution has been worse than in any
previous year within their experience. This
is despite the fact that an enormous amount
has been done to smother the distress and
put it out of sight by shunting the destitute
on to relief works and by sending them out
scrub-cutting, forest-thinning, and bush-
felling in the Far West, where the difficulty
of getting back has helped materially to keep
them out of evidence. Most, if not all, of
these works have been paid for with borrowed
money, so that the bill for quite a lot of pre-
sent day pauperism has been handed down
to posterity. The deposits made in the P.O.
Savings Bank were less in ’96 than in any
year since ’93, and the withdrawals were the
largest on record save in ’93 only ; also the
net increase in deposits was the smallest
since 1890. The increase in deposits in the
Commissioners’ Savings Bank has been
smaller than in any one of the previous
eight years, the panic year of ’93 alone ex-
cepted, and the increase in the two institu-
tions is only half what it was in ’94 and ’95.
As the Savings Banks are essentially the
banks of the people, these figures go to prove
that the condition of the masses was worse
in ’96—the first year of the new Freetrade
era—than in either of the two previous years.
The N.S.W. deposits in banks of issue
declined £850,000 against last year’s de-
cline of £163,000; and this doesn’t seem to
show that any special outbreak of prosperity
has struck the propertied classes. This
decline is especially noticeable as the total
deposits for the seven provinces show a large
increase.
* * * *
The State revenue in New South Wales
has been going through a bad experience.
Last financial year closed on 30th J une with
a deficit of £635,000, which fact, revealed in
the Government statistics, made a depressing
commentary on the alleged large surplus.
Since then the result of six months’ work
is reported to be that expenditure is
another £336,000 ahead of revenue. The
imports of merchandise, which represent a
liability that the province has to liquidate,
increased by nearly £3,000,000, while the
exports which pay for them only increased
by about £200,000, therefore the province
is evidently accumulating new liabilities at
a rapid rate. The collapse in property values
has still gone on ; sales by auction of lands
and bricks and mortar are set down at
£450,000 for the year against £560,000 for
’95 ; £700,000 for ’94; £950,000 for ’93,
and 1£ millions for '92. The story every-
where is that property is almost as unsale-
able as any other white elephant ; and the
municipal valuations show that the decline
in values still continues. Nothing has been
heard of any improvement in manufacturing
industries, though it will be a year before
any complete returns under this head are
available ; nor has there been any visible
advance in wages. Except that there is an
extension of the area under wheat there is
no visible increase of prosperity anywhere ;
in every other respect the tendency seems to
be still backwards. The above figures are
taken almost wholly from the reports pub-
lished by the two Sydney freetrade dailies
on Ist January, therefore they constitute
the Freetrade party’s own account of its
own boom. It isn’t a very complete account,
certainly, but, so far as it goes, it deserves
to rank with the saddest boom narratives ever
put into print.
• * *
. T™ Bulletin doesn’t profess to assert
that .Protection alone would have made any-
thing very large and gorgeous out of the
unpromising materials which exist in this
mortgaged and BuLL-ridden province. There
never was a nostrum invented which would
cure everything. But what it does assert is
that the great Foreign-trade party put forth
its nostrum as a remedy which, taken alone
would, by its own blessed virtues, lift New
feouth Wales out of the slough of depression,
and it hasn t lifted worth a cent. The pro
vince has now enjoyed 12 months of the
most advanced Freetrade it has yet experi-
enced, and the result, as shown by the facts
announced in its own press organs, is that
1896 has been one of the worst years in the
record of the last decade or more, it the
'present situation of things is caused by
Freetrade then it shows that Freetrade is a
delusion and an aggravated disaster. It the
absence of prosperitv under Freetrade isn t
caused by Freetrade but by some extraneous
influences, then the common assertion that
the want of prosperity in V ictoria is neces-
sarily caused by Protection is an imbecile
mode of argument. Assuming that depres-
sion in Melbourne proves the fiscal policy of
that city to be utterly wrong, then the de-
pression of Sydney proves exactly the same
thing about its contrary fiscal policy. Mean-
while, the good time that is always just on
the verge of arriving is not visibly nearer,
and “the Depression” promises to be the
same reliable subject of discussion in 9i as
it has been for the last seven years or so.
* * * *
The one decent apology that can be made
for the failure is that the materials available
were too bad to make any sudden improve-
ment possible. This isn’t much of an apology,
seeing that the party now in power swept the
polls in 1894 on its blatant assurance that all
the troubles of the province were owing to
the black iniquity of Protection; still, if the
Foreign-trade crowd is willing to admit that
it was a liar in ’94, and a very bad Ananias
in ’95, it can construct some kind of an
apology for its failure. Australia has never
yet found its proper level; it is a country
with a short history, and so many dizzy
booms have been crowded into its record that
it hasn’t yet had an opportunity to ascertain
its real value. It began with a mild kind of
land-boom ; there was a whole continent to
be taken for nothing, and everybody could
be a bloated landholder who wanted to. It
had another good time when the pastoral
industry commenced, and it found that
immense fortunes were to be made by grow-
ing wool on land that cost practically nothing,
and sending it away to supply the perpetual
demands of Europe. The gold-boom fol-
lowed ; almost the largest and most glittering
boom in history. Then came the borrowing
boom, when Australia piled up in a handful
of years the biggest debt on earth in propor-
tion to population. There was a coal-boom,
in a small way, in the days when this happy
land had almost a monopoly of the markets
of the Pacific ; a silver-boom, when the
richest deposits on earth were discovered at
the Barrier ; sundry land - booms, when
almost everybody grew rich by swapping his
1.0. U. for the 1.0. U. of the next man; and
a glorious banking-boom, during which this
became the most overbanked country on this
earth. Then, last of all, came the Westralian
company-promoting boom—which wasn’t ex-
actly a gold-boom, for want of the gold, but
which brought a good deal of cash and paper
into Australia and took away no visible
equivalent.
* * * *
No other country on earth is ever known
to have compressed so much boom into so
short a time or into so small a population.
And now that some of the booms are gone
for ever, and the rest are gone, probably for
ever, but certainly for a time, and the
country has almost its first chance to sober
down in a whole century, New South Wales
is gravely informed by the more ardent
devotees of its two political parties that a
tariff adjustment is all that is wanted to
bring the good old days back once more.
The Foreign-trade party having the largest
and most loud-mouthed section of the press
on its side has had the best chance to make
a particular fool of itself in this direction.
Wherefore Premier Reid climbed into power
in ’94 with assurances that poverty, depres-
sion, want of employment, and ail other
distresses would cease almost immediately,
because he was going to turn his little penny
squirt on the ruins, and at the beginning of
’96 he got it fairly turned on, with the result
that the ruins, so far, haven’t budged an inch.
A Criminal Court of Appeal.
One of the most glaring defects of Australian
Criminal Law is the want of machinery for
attaining anything like equality in the sen-
tences imposed for similar offences. A glance
at the daily reports of the criminal courts will
reveal a great disparity between the sentences
imposed for the same or similar offences by
different Judges. No doubt the disposition
options of a Judge will, to an extent,
artect his sentences; though it is noticeable that
they do not seem to affect all the punishments
inflicted by him, but only those imposed for
certain offences. One Judge views with
especial horror offences against the person, and
deals leniently with those against property.
Another seems to imagine that society will go
to the dogs unless offences against property are
severely punished, while personal injuries are
of small import in his eyes. One Judge
exhibits a weakness for embezzlers ; another
treats them with merciless severity. Now
the iaw leaves a large discretion ’ in the
hands of the Judges—it fixes only a maximum
and minimum penalty-but each Judge exer-
cises his discretion according to principles of
his own, or according as his fancy or prejudice
directs. There is plainly no attempt whatever,
on the part of the administrators of the law, to
introduce any degree of uniformity into the
punishments for criminal offences. One would
almost imagine that the process of arriving at
the number M of imprisonment for a
me was— Heads, five years ; tails, two.”
Another defect is the want of a’ tribunal
fact Cl as Can n nterta f ln i appeals on questions of
tact, as well as of law. In N.S. Wales the
only method ot reviewing a j£y'. vercUct
where no .natter of law is involved, i, provided
by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which
allows the Governor, in the event of any question
arising as to the prisoner’s guilt, to order an
enquiry before a Justice. There is, how-ever, no
tribunal to which a convicted person can ap-
peal as of right. The appeal under the Criminal
Law Act is seldom resorted to, because it is an
uncertain one, and because there is always an
appeal to the mercy of the Crown ; and the
latter is just as valuable and just as objection-
able a procedure as the former. The preroga-
tive of mercy is exercised by the Governor, in
capital cases, on the advice of the Executive
Council; in other cases, on the advice of the
Minister for Justice. So practically the prero-
gative is placed in the hands of one Minister,
or of the Executive. This is indeed a most
inconvenient device for reviewing criminal sen-
tences. The administration of justice should
be, as far as possible, removed from political
influences, yet here you have the prerogative of
mercy exercised by accidental persons whose
qualification for doing so is probably a political
qualification and nothing more. And how do
these persons exercise it ? The now notorious
Suffield case shows, in all its hideousness, the
iniquity of placing such a power in the hands
of professional politicians, and, it may be, of
political adventurers. Does any man in the
community think that, had Suffield been
an “ influential ” citizen, or one connected by
ties of blood or friendship with any person of
importance in the world of politics, his case
would have been so disgracefully shelved ? If
such a question as this can be asked, it must be
placed to the credit of the system which renders
it possible. The administration of justice should
be above suspicion, and, while the present sys-
tem is persisted in, it never can. It is impos-
sible for a tribunal sitting in secret, receiving
evidence admissible in no court of law, and
coming to conclusions for which it gives no
reasons, to command either the respect or the
confidence of the people.
* * * *
The remedy is not far to seek. The time has
come for the establishment of a Criminal Court
of Appeal, a tribunal which can review ques-
tions both of law and fact, and which will also
have power to revise sentences passed on
prisoners ; to this Court every prisoner should
have an appeal as of right. It is tolerably cer-
tain that the process of such a Court would
not be abused ; the power of increasing, as well
as of reducing sentences, would always be a
stumbling-block in the way of frivolous appeals.
Every sentence passed by any Court might
come before this body for revision. It is per-
haps impossible to impose on such a Court
rules regarding the exact amount of punishment
for each offence. An eminent English criminal
Judge once said : “A Court of Criminal Appeal
could only correct improper sentences when
passed, whereas the great object to be attained
was to prevent, as far as possible, such unjust
sentences as are constantly brought to our
notice being passed at all.” This is, no doubt,
correct; but the experience to be derived from
the accumulation of cases decided on systematic
principles by a Court of Appeal, would tend
largely to prevent the infliction of punishments
which shock the feelings of the community, and
which are too often a travesty on Justice.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
"Something” Should Be Done.
A correspondent of Melbourne Champion
writes :
I don’t want to insist upon details, but my proposition
roughly is that at this coining' general election the return
shall be secured of a number of candidates definitely
pledged to force the next Ministry to introduce a land-
values tax and apply its proceeds to decrease burdens
which do not affect the fiscal issue—say, to halving rail-
way rates or reducing duties on articles of general con-
sumption that cannot be produced locally. By “forcing
the Ministry ” I mean turning it out of office at once on
its refusal to do this, and then its successors after it, if
they too refuse. When the proposal is sent to the
Council and rejected, the Ministry must in the same way
be forced to appeal at once to the country on the matter.
They would certainly receive overwhelming support and
a direct mandate to go for the Council “ without the
gloves.” All this can be done if the requisite vigor and
courage are available.
The little Champion, which is a paper of
amazing vigor for its size, announces that it is
thinking of following this good advice, and
starting a crusade with the object of forcing
the Ministry to go bald-headed for the House
of 48 Rich Landlords. The trouble is that this
correspondent, like almost every similar person
down South, “doesn’t want to insist on
details.” Every Vic. Democrat knows that the
Ministry or the Assembly or somebody should
go bald-headed for the Leg. Council and wipe
that horror out of existence, and till that is
done every reform will either be cast out igno-
miniously, or else “amended ” to be as little re-
form as possible. Therefore the Council wants to
be “gone for,” and because in England and
most of the Australias the Upper House is a
nominee body which can be swamped by
new appointments if the Lower House
is sufficiently in earnest to do it, the
stereotyped Victorian, when he wakes up,
always wants to know why his Government
doesn’t do something. The Vic. Council is
almost wholly out of the Government’s reach;
there is absolutely no way provided by which
the Government can squeeze that recalcitrant
assemblage ; but it can be done in Hingland
under totally different conditions, and that is
enough. The Champion’s correspondent, like
every other one, “doesn’t want to insist on
details ” ; which practically means that he
doesn t know how to attack the Council, but
he proposes to insist on the Ministry' knowing
what he doesn’t know himself, and on throwing
it out if it doesn’t know what he is unable to
e I 1 1. It is a pity some individual of wealth,
like David Syme, doesn’t offer a big prize for
e best detailed plan of how to surely and
eltectively squash Victoria’s great obstruction.
Consider the circumstances of the case : There
are, it is said, only about 150 Victorians who
are eligible, by sufficient wealth and other
nngs, for seats in the Council, and who have
the leisure to go there. The great majority of
em aie lories ; the mere possession of suffi-
cient wealth is a guarantee of that. The
coun ry, to all intents and purposes must elect
ones, or mostly Tories, for want of a suffi-
ciency of other candidates—at least it appears


so up to date. Having been elected, they go
on “something awful.” The Ministry can’t
make them do otherwise ; it has about as much
direct control over them as over the white bear
in Greenland. The Assembly can’t ; it has just
as much control as the Ministry. To dissolve
the Assembly and get a mandate from the
people is wholly irrelevant ; the Council gets its
own mandate, which, for the above reasons,
is generally a Tory one, and it has nothing to
do with the Assembly’s mandate. Moreover, to
dissolve the democratic House and put it to
the expense and worry of an election because
the other House isn’t democratic is kicking a
friend because the enemy can’t be got at. Also
to throw out the Ministry because it doesn’t
know any better than those who made it what
to do in this particular deadlock, is wholly
ridiculous. Unless somebody can say definitely
what should be done, nobody has any right to
complain because somebody else doesn’t do it.
The British Parliament might possibly be
moved to do something to Vic. Council, but,
judging from Berry’s experience, it is highly
improbable. The Federal Parliament, if it
comes, might be endowed with power to amend
the provincial constitutions. The Government
might introduce a Bill radically amending the
Council by making it a paid body, and in other
ways, and stop supplies till it was passed ; that is
to say, it might stop the Assembly’s salaries, and
the Civil Service salaries, and the interest on
the public debt, and close up the railway ser-
vice through non-payment of wages, and make
a general stoppage of everything ; in which
case the Council might climb down or it might
not. As it would probably feel the trouble
less than most people there is no absolute
assurance that it would climb down. Again,
the Council might be attacked with waddies,
and red revolution might be let loose at the top
of Bourke-street, if anybody would revolushe,
which is doubtful. Or if £lOO,OOO were avail-
able some brainy men might work up a huge
crusade among the electors, and possibly get in
48 Rich Landlords who would be almost, though
not quite, as bad as the present ones. These
are the only things The Bulletin knows of
that can be tried, barring private assassination
or Thuggee, and it is a pity the people who yell
so much that “something should be done”
don’t explain definitely which thing they would
prefer.
The Great Cold-Tea Downfall. '
The M.L. Cold-Tea party is now trying hard
to find out what struck it. At the Local Option
poll in 1894 the Prohibitionists carried one
district only—Balclutha. This time Balclutha
has gone back on its faith to some extent, but
there has been a partial success at Hawera by
way of some compensation. The total figures
don’t show that the Prohibition movement has
retrograded to any serious extent; it certainly
hasn’t progressed as its apostles boasted it was
doing, or risen in an overwhelming wave, or
done any of the other glorious things expected
of it, but its solid band of fanatics remains
about as solid as ever. Yet the party which
returned 23 members to Parliament at the ’93
election now musters only 11 ; and, instead of
holding the balance of power, which it would
have done if its phalanx had remained un-
broken, and putting the Premiership up to
auction, it is only a lone fragment of no particu-
lar account. The party badly wants to know
how, with its adherents practically as numer-
ous as ever, it should have gone to such utter
smash as a Parliamentary force, and yet it
flatly refuses to believe the only feasible explan-
ation—that it was lost through its own aggres-
sive tactics and general unpleasantness. In ’93
the Prohibitionists did not pose as an en-
tirely distinct political organisation. The Cold
Tea candidate didn’t profess to disregard abso-
lutely everything save his dreary, indigestible
fad ; he was a Liberal or a Conservative, and
was willing to admit that ginger-beer wasn’t
the beginning and middle and end of all things
earthly. But the party grew inflated by its
partial success, and resolved to be a wholly
separate political power, and to abjure the
heathen who drank occasional beer, and have
no truck with the Amalekites, or some other
scriptural phrase to that effect. Its candidates
were, in as many cases as it could be so arranged,
men who frankly declared that the great issue
of Cold Tea overshadowed everything. They
would vote for Seddon or Russell with equal
facility, which ever would go for Prohibition
of the most uncompromising type. Their theory
was that State Socialism, land problems, old
age pensions, State Land Bank and Fire Insur-
ance schemes, finance, Protection or Freetrade
or Revenue-Tariffism, and all other matters
were side issues, and if the Cold Tea gospel
could be advanced by throwing any or all of them
overboard they should go overboard promptly.
And then the Prohibition party went down
with a crash, and great was the fall thereof.
Apparently the big success of 1893 was solely
owing to the fact that it kept the most aggra-
vated aspect of its faith out of sight. It was
carried in on the shoulders of the Liberal party,
whereas it fancied things were the other way
about, and when it resolved to stand by itself
and to invite the country to come and be cured
of all its ills by one fad alone, the fact suddenly
came to light that the Prohibition crowd was a
very ordinary and cheeky minority of no special
account. But for its lamentable tactics, the
teetotal regime might almost have arrived in
Maoriland ; as matters stand, it seems to have
gone back a dozen years or so. Consequently,
it revenges itself by using violent Dead Bird
language about all its opponents, and says, as
usual, that they are “ lost.” Every semi-pious
organisation, when it doesn’t come uppermost,
lays the pleasing unction to its soul that every-
body else is “lost” and will frizzle for un-
counted billions of years down Below.
The Beautiful “Business Man.”
The S.M. Herald, which always has an eye to
the boosting along of private enterprise, builds
a neat little sermon on the Victorian postal
department muddle. “ The irrigation scheme
has failed,” says the eminently right-thinking
paper ; “ the railway department has to take
the responsibility for useless lines which no
buxines* wan would ever have constructed, and an
enquiry regarding the management of the Post
and Telegraph Department has revealed,” &c.,
&c. The point of these remarks lies in the
assertion that no business man would ever have
constructed the unpayable railways with which
the State has burdened itself in Australia,
There are some discrepancies in the statement,
certainly, inasmuch as the people who built
these lines were mostly business men of one
kind or another—bankers, financiers, land and
house jobbers, merchants, importers, spirit-
dealers, and the like. Also, if Richard
Speight wasn’t a business man, what was he ?
Also, a business man is almost any kind of
person who sits at a table in an office, and as
the Herald can’t personally know more than a
fraction per cent, of the business men in exist-
ence its assurance that no business man would
have done the acts above alluded to is mere
reckless disregard for the Terewth In a
general way, however, the Herald’s meaning
isn’t more hazy than might have been expected
It is something to the effect that the people
who build State railways aren’t business
men, and those who build private ones
are, and no private railway builder would be
such a fool as to burden the country with such
lines as the State railway-builders construct
Yet last year every State railway system in
continental Australia and Maoriland showed
better profits than the average of the United
States, where business men have been running
the show all along on business lines. And the
United States are lavishly dotted with tem-
porarily or permanentlv abandoned lines—
abandoned because they didn’t pay for engine-
grease and other working expenses. Even in
England it is possible to find railways which
have paid no dividend for nine or ten years
and seem unlikely ever to pay one. The theory
that no business man would build a hopelessly
unprofitable line on private enterprise prin-
ciples is utterly knocked on the head by the
fact that these same men have built such things
over half the globe, and are still doing it Even
Melbourne’s dreadful Outer Circle railway was
never so ruinous as many of the works which
business men have constructed in the western
States of the U.S. Australia has certainly
muddled its national railway system, but, com-
pared to many samples of private enterprise, its
management has been a thing of absolute
genius. Duncan Gillies himself was a better
manager, if judged by results, than the
majority of the private enterprise railroaders of
the western U.S and, considering how very
little can be said for Duncan, it is gratifying to
a^e to sa y this much.

The Philosophy of the Gum-Tree.
a New South Wales bush district two boys
are awaiting trial, at this glad New Year
season, on a charge of murdering and carefully
cremating the old man. W hether they did it
or no L or whether it was the old man or some
ot her person who was cremated, it is certain
that somebody was so successfully disposed of
a bonfire that only a few buttons and boot-
nads and part of a skull were found among the
ashes. The two sons assisted the police to sift
remains of the alleged old man, and
s P ec ial note is made of the fact that they did so
without any sign of interest or emotion what-
soever. This doesn t prove anything at all
about the alleged murder, but it does help to
P rove the sad, depressed, unemotional casual-
ness of Australia junior, in the bush. Any in-
dividual with ordinary nerves would have been
a Bttle interested in the work of fishing out any-
body s remains from the ash-heap, but Aus-
tralia junior, as he is in the bush, takes that
matter as tranquilly as he takes most others,
exce pt horse. If the crime is brought home to
the accused pair, or to anybody else like them,
USUfd wail about the results of a godless
system of education may be expected to follow
a ® a matter of course. And the fact that the
dire monotony of the plains and the burnt ridges
and the gum-tree and the crow might have any-
thing to do with it will never be even alluded to
by the orthodox. Yet, in all probability, the
plains and the gum-tree and the crow are more
largely responsible than anything else, and the
dry creeks and the burnt grass and the laughing
jackass and the interminable wire fences also
bear a considerable share of the responsibility,
In o system of education, however godly, could
bear up against them, even if godly education
didn t consist so largely as it does of shudder-
some stories about battle, murder, and premedi-
fated disembowelment in Israel. Tragedy in
dr y bush regions of Australia has a charac-
er *ts °wn. Generally there is very little
motive > or visible motive at all, save the sad,
torpid looniness brought about by long com-
pression of the brain with the dead weight of
much gum-tree and kookaburra, and much
waterless immensity. It isn t done suddenly
or vvith anger ; there is a slow, dull method
about it, born of the fact that the world moves
slowly in the bush, and there is any amount of
leisure, and the corpse that isn t cremated to-
day can always be frizzled to-morrow. And the
person accused of the bush horror, whether he
* s acc u sed rightly or wrongly, is almost always
described as accepting the situation with abso-
late indifference. It is the custom to set this
down also to the godless system of education,
but it is gum-tree rather than godlessness,
Everyone grows to be indifferent in the second
° r tLird. generation of existence in the land of
l° n S> l° n S dusty roads and miles and miles of
monotonous wire or post-and-rail fence. Life
ouly means more gum-tree and dry creek and
burnt ridge or dusty, limitless plain, more crow
and kookaburra, and all the rest. Death means
no ° n . e knows exactly what; the person whose
s °ul i s deadened with years of plain and sad
eucalyptus hasn t any wondrous ideals of the
hereafter. Moreover, if he has emotions they
don fc sur f ac ®> f° r the ponderous
bulk of the eucalyptus and the dry ridge are on
top of them to hold them down ; therefore he
gets a reputation for callousness and indifference
—which may or may not be wholly deserved.
The proposal to awaken the selector’s off-
spring to a brighter state by teaching him in
his school days about the dry wastes of Syria
and the 40-years plodding of Israel through a
thirsty wilderness is sadly misappropriate,
An individual with so much dust and drought
in his own existence can’t be elevated by infor-
mation about the dust and drought of 4000
years ago. Irrigation and artesian wells and
green grass would do more to put light into the
soul of the young bush Australian than all the
arid Scripture which ever came out of waterless
Palestine.

The Federationist with One Idea.
A vigorous attempt is already being made to
intrude the fiscal ghost at the approaching
Federal Convention elections. It is to be hoped
that the country will put a large hoof on this
nefarious scheme and squash it flat. The busi-
ness of the Convention is to make a Federal
Government, and that Government will decide,
by direction of the people, the future tariff
policy of Australia. If the O’Sullivan or Max
Hirsch wants to talk Protection, or Freetrade,
or Single-tax to the people at this juncture he
should be ordered to grind his little pet axe
elsewhere. The fact that a candidate belongs
to some particular fiscal creed is as irrelevant
on this occasion as the fact that he has
a broken nose or red hair, or that he is
a boss footballer. No sane individual sug-
gests that the future tariff policy of Aus-
tralia should be prescribed in the constitu-
tion, and that this generation should seriously
attempt to tie down all future ones to its
peculiar tariff belief, whatever it may be.
Therefore, the man whose sole claim to con-
sideration is that he is a prominent Protec-
tionist or Freetrader or Single-Taxer or Pro-
hibitionist isn’t wanted ; he may know a lot
about these things, but none of them are going
to be in the constitution, and his knowledge is
of no use. He is as much out of place as the
man who wants to command an ironclad fleet
on the ground that he is a specially,successful
shoemaker. The work in hand is to make a
constitution which will have no large, unwork-
able holes in it, and which will be capable of
amendment at any time by the exercise of the
popular will. This latter is far more essen-
tial than that it should be perfect just
now. The constitution which is absolutely
without flaw at the date of its construction—
that is to say, which is wholly in accord with
the popular sentiment of the majority to-day—
would probably be antiquated, useless, and
utterly out of accord with the ideas of 50 years
hence. Therefore, if a perfect constitution is
made now, and so fixed as to be practically
incapable of amendment, the chances are that
it will lead by-and-bye to revolution. The con-
stitutions of Tasmania and Victoria, which
were adjusted with such beautiful ingenuity as
to put the Upper House practically beyond
amendment, are cases in point; they were very
respectable institutions when they were made,
and they are now awful beyond expression.
Therefore, the matter at issue is the making of
an elastic constitution—one which can be
amended to meet all manner of circumstances
which it is now impossible to foresee and defin-
itely provide against, and which won’tattemptto
rivet any fleeting enthusiasm of to-day onto the
people of to-morrow. In these circumstances
there is no use for the individual whose sole
claim for consideration is that he is an
able defender of only one particular brand of
anything, and he should be rejected without a
moment’s hesitation. The individual whose
whole life is devoted to the defence of one par-
ticular sample of something is almost always of
opinion that his especial nostrum is so beautiful
and such a perfect panacea for everything that
it should be embedded in the constitution
where no one will ever be able to get it out
again. This applies equally to the person who
has risen to note solely on the sectarian racket,
or the Cold Tea racket, or on Freetrade, Pro-
tection, Single-tax, the defence of “the Con-
stitooshon,” and all the other men of one idea.
They should all be left out, but as the men with
the one fiscal idea promise to make the most
trouble they should be left out even more en-
thusiastically than the rest. The only person
who calls for even more prompt rejection than
the man of one idea is the man of no idea at all.
The proposal of Copeland, M.L.A., to open
hotels during certain hours on Sundays roused
Parson Boyce, of the New South Wales Local
Option League, to much wrath in the columns
of S.M. Herald. Says Boyce :
Directly the Sunday closing law of 1882 came into force
there was a substantial decrease in the convictions for
Sunday drunkenness, and an immediate improvement in
the order and as to the peacefulness of the day. The
closing did immense good. As to convictions for drunken-
ness and “drunk and disorderly,” I ask especial attention
to the figures Mr. Gould very recently gave in Parliament.
He said that the convictions for last year for the above-
named offences on Saturdays were 5860, and for Sundays
only 1196. How great the difference ! In 1894 it was
notable that at 160 of our police-courts there were no con-
victions for those offences. In that year the Saturday
convictions were 5062, as against 1245 for Sundays.
Should Mr. Copeland’s Bill be passed, a large increase in
the convictions for drunkenness may be very confidently
anticipated. It is a gruesome picture.
This is an elaborate dodging of the whole ques-
tion, which is : Does Sunday closing diminish
the sum total of drunkenness ? If the number
of arrests counts for anything it doesn’t. In
1881, when hotels were open on Sunday, there
were 22,560 arrests. In 1883, when they were
closed, the arrests numbered 23,178. They
steadily increased till 1886, when they num-
bered 26,310. After that a decline set
in. Boyce, it will be observed, doesn’t
say that drunkenness diminished. He doesn’t
even say that Sunday drunkenness dimin-
ished. He simply asserts that after the hotels
were closed on the Day of Drought there were
fewer arrests for drunkenness on Sunday than
on Saturday, which is quite true. There were
also fewer drunks on Sunday than on Saturdays
in the days when the hotels were open, but this
fact is carefully suppressed, thereby creating an
altogether false impression that Sunday-closing
had something to do with the difference—a
point on which there is no evidence at all. If
arrests count for anything, then it seems that
drunkenness was steadily declining until the
Sunday-closing law came into force, when there
was a sudden and violent reaction, and it took
eight years to get over the shock and return to
the state of sobriety attained in the old Sunday-
beer days. There is no proof, of course, that
Sunday-closing caused drunkenness, but there
is abundant proof in the Government Statis-
tician’s figures that it didn’t prevent it. And
Boyce’s way of leaving the real question out,
and throwing in wholly irrelevant figures that
have no more to do with the matter than has
the diameter of Saturn, is a sorrowful example
of parsonical logic.
Premier Reid’s suggestion that the State
should resume all the Sydney wharves is a big
and statesmanlike idea if it is only carried out
the right way. But the first essential, before
any more large transactions of the kind are
attempted, is a law which fixes some kind of
relation between the tax valuation and the
resumption value, so that the State vron’t be
swindled more than is absolutely necessary. As
things are now, a valuer may swear for tax or
probate purposes that a property is only worth
.£lOOO, and a month later, when it is a’ case of
resuming the property, the same business gent,
without any fear of a prosecution for gross per-
jury, can swear that it is good value for
£lO,OOO or thereabouts. Also, the system of
leaving valuations to juries is unprofitable,
because the average jury is always agin’ the
Government, and the system of fixing valua-
tions by any kind of law proceedings is bad
because the ghastly item of costs swallows up
nearly everything. Every item of city pro-
perty has a value put on it for purposes of
municipal taxation, and every square-inch
of land is further valued for State
taxation purposes, yet by the weird sys-
tem now in force, neither of these valua-
tions bears any reference whatever to the
price the State has to pay when it wants to re-
sume. Further, if the Government is going to
borrow a large sum to pay for the wharves, it
would be interesting to know if there is to be a
sinking-fund attached to the loan, or if the
price of the present wharves is to be a perman-
ent burden on posterity, and if, when they
wear out, new ones are to be built also w r ith
borrowed money, and so on till the only assets
to show against millions of buried cash are the
memories of piles and timbers which rotted
away in past ages. There are places in Sydney
where three successive Government wharves
have worn out and gone to pieces, but the one
that disappeared 40 years ago isn’t paid for yet,
and its memory is still set down as a “ per-
manent and reproductive w'ork,” and the in-
terest is going on to this day.
Some N.S.W. country schoolmasters complain
that Sydney University will not confer degrees
without attendance on lectures. Therefore, no
matter what their deserts as tested by examina-
tion, country students are given no University
recognition unless they are prepared to spend,
at the lowest, £2OO or £3OO during enforced
residence in Sydney. So far as The Bulletin’s
experience goes, a Sydney University degree is
no testimonial of intellectual power or learning :
bright spirits and dullards seem to achieve it
with equal ease. But the label has still its
value in scholastic circles, apparently; and,
that being so, there is no reason why it should
not be tacked to all who earn it, whether lec-
tured at Sydney or not. The residence plan,
as applied at Sydney University, is a ridiculous
waste of time and money. In older countries,
and at an earlier day, University residence im-
plied a deliberate sacrifice of the student to his
studies. His whole life was under the scrutiny
of the officials ; his incomings and outgoings were
watched ; the formation of his character was
no less cared for than the development of his
mind. In Sydney, so long as he attends the
lectures, a student does practically as he
pleases. The University takes no cognisance
or control of his outer life. But the pretext of
lectures and residence is put forward to justify
the appointment of professors at extravagant
salaries which neither their work nor their
worth entitle them to. With some exceptions,
the Sydney and Melbourne professorships are
merely pools of stagnation. The holders work
to get them ; then they work as little as
possible to keep them. The results are dis-
gracefully small in proportion to expenditure.
A few rich men’s sons drift in and out of the
lecture-halls ; poor lads in Sydney may manage
to attend evening classes ; in the country they
are excluded altogether. It will always be so
as long as the State heavily subsidises an insti-
tution which it does not directly control, and
maintains it, not as an integral part of the
national educational system, but as that sys-
tem’s ridiculous and expensive excrescence.
Editor Bulletin, —The extraordinary scenes
that so often occur in Melbourne, the city of
sects, where fervent religionists accuse one an-
other of sexual immoralities, may tickle the
imaginations of a few, but they must make the
judicious grieve. The scoffer is apt to declare
that religion is proved an incentive to sensu-
ality, while the orthodox contend that sensuality
has demoralised religion. Either conclusion is
unsatisfactory. The fact appears to be even
worse, viz., that much religious passion and
much sexual passion are merely forms of hys-
teria. Among the churches and the sects there
are some that are more aggressively sectarian
than others—that is to say, they are given to
enthusiastic schism among themselves. They
disrupt at intervals, and, like certain micro-
scopic monsters when cut up, each portion im-
mediately acquires the power of separate or-
ganic existence. It is among these that you
find individuals possessed of a creed as poor
wretches of old were possessed of devils. It
is among such that salacious scandals thrive
at certain periods. In other bodies of less
centrifugal energy the scandals remain un-
noticed, or are hushed up. Of course, in many
of these sects, religion, considered as a high
spiritual or philosophic ideal, is almost un-
known. The motive-power, so to speak, is
only quasi-spiritual, and induced by sensuous
hymn-tunes and hypnotic sermons. Here is an
illustrative fact. The present writer has seen,
in a Ballarat hall, a thousand people on their
knees, singing ecstatically an emotional hymn,
eyes closed, hands clasped, bodies swaying as
if in a savage incantation; here and there
women became hysterical, while strong men
were rendered almost helpless by convulsive
sobbing. A percentage of such a crowd must
suffer mentally by abnormal excitement of this
sort. Having succumbed to emotions of one
kind, emotions of another will be less readily
resisted.—F.
Why there are unemployed in N.S. Wales :
During December “ that great country ” imported
oranges from Syria, lemons and dried fruits from
Europe, sugar from Mauritius, and wheat, tinned
meats, and flour from America. This is what is
meant by our “self-reliant spirit.”


SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Lyceum “ Lady Blarney.”
Royal “ Tommy Atkins.”
Her Majesty's “ Sinbad the Sailor.”
Criterion a “A Woman of No Im-
portance.”
Palace Goatcher’s Variety Co.
Tivoli Rickards’ Variety Co.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess’s “Matsa.”
Royal “ For England.”
Bijou “ Adventures of Miss
Brown.”
Opera House Rickards’ Variety Co.
After the vast outbreak last week, when
every Sydney theatre blossomed forth with a new
show for the season of the assassinated fowl,
theatrical matters have boiled down to a compara-
tive calm. The Cri. alone announces a change for
Saturday—Oscar Wilde’s “ Woman of No Import-
ance,” which should go well if it is anything like
the other plays by the same yellow decadent which
Sydney has witnessed. Meanwhile, “Nancy and
Co.” is still in possession, and the audience is
steadily falling in love with Miss Hope Mavne’s
pretty little brogue, and Mario Majeroni’s dazzling
front teeth shine forth like a lantern on a wreck.
The stately Majeroni is much less stiff than he
used to be, and promises to be a very valuable per-
son by-and-bye. The very latest feature about the
co. at present is Percy Ward’s laugh—a low, in-
ward cackle which he only lets off three times in
the course of the evening. There has been nothing
more remarkable in this line at the Cri. since
George Leitch’s maniac cachinnated there in two
syllables many years ago. Next week the co.’s
very newest new man, Edward Ferris, makes his
appearance, likewise Miss Florence Seymour and
Mrs. Bracy.
** * *
Westmacott’s pantomime at Her Majesty’s
Is as remarkable for Crackles’ multiplicity of hats
as it was in the beginning, and it is getting nearly
time that some person put these interminable head-
gear into a quartz-battery and pounded them
under the stampers. The management lately
arranged to have its audience photographed, but,
with true gentlemanly feeling, it gave notice of its
purpose by advt., so that the man who was sup-
posed to be at the office making up the half-yearly
balance had due warning not to take his bar-
Flossie there on the fatal occasion. A second
edition of “Sinbad” is in reserve to be produced
when occasion calls for it. Meanwhile, the old
edition is getting on well enough. The audience
has now become hardened against Crackles’
numerous hats, and they don’t take its attention
off the fine scenic effects so much as they did.
And even if Crackles had six times as many hats
as he has, it would be worth while to suffer them
all, and the other jokes as well, for the sake of the
pictorial dazzle of the show.
** * *
At Sydney Royal, “ Tommy Atkins ” still
rages furiously in his red coat, and the wicked-
ness of H. Diver is black beyond expression.
Diver is one of the most bowefless reprobates in
melodrama. He hasn’t the occasional moments of
remorse with which the ordinary villain is
afflicted ; he never looks back regretfully on his
mis-spent life, nor is he suddenly recalled to
thoughts of his innocent boyhood by the sight of
a red cow drifting across a paddock just as the
red cow used to do at home in childhood’s happy
hours. He looks a great deal happier, on the
whole, than the hero, and the ghost of his victims
doesn’t haunt him at all, and he dies quite as com-
fortably as anybody else. The moral which Diver
conveys is that, if you are unspeakably wicked
and habitually bathe in gore you may have
a good billet and a nicely - fitting uniform
all your life, and enjoy good cigars and
pleasant wines, and have the shiniest boots in
the regiment, and harry the good man all
the days of your life, and keep a harem, and
borrow money from the heavy father, and gener-
ally damn everything. And the other moral, as
conveyed by Plimmer, is that if you are a good
man you may be a curate at £2 a week, and after
that a private soldier, and wait ten years for your
best girl who has been ruined by the wicked cap-
tain in the interim, and the heavy father won’t
lend you a copper. On the whole, the wicked cap-
tain has so much the best of the deal that the
present writer gives up any attempt at being good
from this date, and proposes henceforth to be a
bloodthirsty desperado through his agent.

The man in woman’s clothes at the Lyceum
continues to moderate audiences —most Sydney
audiences just now range from moderate to awful,
there being far more theatre afloat than there is
any real demand for. Further consideration of
this personage induces The Bulletin to put him
even ahead of the Widow O’Brien ; he is plea-
santer and brighter and more womanly, and as a
middle-aged colleen he looks more real than the
real colleen— if there is any such person—often
does. The play, however, suffers considerably
from the fact that it isn t distinctly either one
thing or another or anything in particular. It is
partly burlesque and partly alleged drama, but
Scot Inglis embezzling the trust-money behind
a screen is obviously never intended to be
a real villain; everybody can see that he
will repent and become painfully good at
the first opportunity, and that Harrie Ireland is
only playing at being led astray and having hor-
rible designs on Ida Hamilton. After a feeling
remark or two from the Irishwoman these two
people instantly decide to marry and be noble
characters for ever afterwards, as they obviously
intended to be all along, and the old parental
forger swears off his wickedness in the back-
ground, and even the people who never aid any
harm resolve to be better than ever. If only one
bad person would remain wicked and walk out un-
regenerate, saying “ damn ” as he goes, it would
improve “Lady Blarney” considerably. It is
absolutely bursting with goodness at the end, and
one refreshing sin would be an oasis.
A number of smaller shows remain in un-
accountable good health, considering that not one
of the big theatres is crushing more than oaw .
to the ton. The gorgeous Palace and the livoii
are both well-filled, and the two Cineinatographes
earn a very respectable crust all the tune.
Jerusalem Cyclorama and Edison s Electric
Parlor also seem to lead a paying existence,
though the persistent demand for such a painTuiiy
ordinary place as Jerusalem, in this land of god-
less education, is hardly accountable. One or u o
small entertainments, however, have gone to tna
long home which is six feet by two, and their
departure has excited the less interest inasmuc
as they were not very definitely alive at any time.
Peace to their dust, if there was enough of them
to make any.

“ Matsa ” is unfolding its gilded splendor
to crowded houses at Melb. Princess’s, and thusfa,r
the pantomimic shortcomings of the I 1 irm s lates
thing in annuals have made no difference to busi-
ness. The spectacle alone is quite good enough to
go on with. When the time arrives fqr the per-
formance to pull itself together, and give further
assistance to the scenery and dresses, that neces-
sary improvement will probably happen,
the early samplers of “ Matsa ” will be persuaded
without difficulty to revisit ancient Memphis and
book more seats for the Rising of the Nile. An
Egyptian ballet at Memphis, preceded by the
arrival of Pharaoh and suite, is a very fine color
effect, and many other things that occur ages ago
are impressive in their way. Pharoah himself
can give points to Lord Brassey, also the four
attendant heralds, who blow barbaric blasts from
abnormal trumpets, seem to harmonise with the
surroundings. “Matsa” is much stronger in
bursts of noise than in outbreaks of merriment.
The bones of “ I)jin Djin ” —which was a pretty,
cheerful extravaganza —protrude from the present
entertainment, instead of being nicely covered
with new meat. Worse than that, the comic-opera
artists who shaped tamely in “Djin Djin” are
now more apathetic than ever, and the one live
success of the company is the pigmy comedian,
Little Gulliver. Leoni Clarke, who ranks as an
auxiliary force, gets applause for his performing
animals, but advance rumors re the Cat King’s
entertainment were a long way ahead of the
commonplace result. A procession of pantomime
animals in the second act is a much more amusing
item, anyway.

Bland Holt’s military hippodrama at Mel-
bourne Royal appears to have caught on as per
expectation. Beginning with a stage fox-hunt in
several tableaux, and ending with an all-round
denunciation of the bold, bad Major, “ Eor Eng-
land ”is a thing to gaze upon and forget. The
Bulletin, in consideration of this being Xmas
time or very near it, is prepared to condone
Walter Baker's unnatural love for Queen Victoria,
likewise, on this occasion only, the British Flag
may be granted a special license to wave rather
more than usual. “ For England ” is a
lavishly - mounted perversion of the truth,
containing a splendidly - impossible bill - dis-
counter. A buoyant Hebrew character part which
introduces Bland Holt as a Zulu on the warpath
would be a fair set-off against the rest of the story
even if all the residue were Flag and flam. There
are, however, other acceptable people besides
Manasses Marks. Misses Elizabeth Watson and
Frances Ross, Mrs. Bland Holt, Charles Brown,
and one or two grief-stricken parents count for
something in the broken narrative, whilst the
hunting-scene deserves great credit for not having
caused any funerals up to date.

Melbourne Bijou is looking healthy on
“The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown,” the
comedy that might as well be “ Charley’s Aunt
disguised as a Boarding School Girl.” A long-
winded detective, played by Guyton Heath, is a
serious drawback to “ Miss Brown.” This alleged
expert from Scotland Yard bears no sort of re-
semblance to any “d.” that ever lived, neither
does he suggest a possibility of his being repro-
duced in the flesh between now and Doomsday,
and when he looms large in the public eye the eye
grows weary. A comedy able to thrive despite
such a heavy load of title and detective certainly
deserves to get on. Frank Thornton, as the red-
headed heroine, is not the sole support of the new
show, although it has no purpose apart from his
escapade in skirts. Some of the minor characters
are well-drawn, and the small cluster of girls in
the academy for young ladies was evidently
arranged by one who has been there. Miss

much more deserving person than a good many

Death recently removed an old Australian theatrical
identity in the person of Charles Wilmot. In 1859 he
supported G. V. Brooke, and later on William Hoskins

became host of the famous old Coal Hole Tavern off the
Strand, where he died.

boozy stage-hand may as well go too. He is distinctly

they insist on the stage-hand having something of the
same professional feeling as the actor. He used to be
anybody; now he must be somebody.”
Apropos of Priscilla Verne’s outbreak at Perth when
she, with a large number of supporters, spanked a solitary
dude under circumstances not too creditable to Priscilla
—a similar attempt was once made by an ex-actress
well-known in Australia, a lady who used to be comely,
and who once promised to be a star of some magnitude.
Possibly it is wrong to speak of her as an ex-actress, for
she still breaks out occasionally, but as she is becoming
more “ex” every day the term is good enough. She
went forth in her young and reckless days to wallop all
editor, and by a grievous misjudgment she took with her
the two smallest and most peaceful members of her co.
as supporters. The trio marched into the editorial roon
the lady and the horse-whip in front. “ Sir,” she said in
a terrible voice : “ I’ve come to horsewhip you for your
statements in yesterday’s paper.” “ What ?” roared the
small editor, rising up with thunder in his eye. When he
rose it proved that he wasn’t nearly so small as he
appeared while sitting down ; he was one of these long-
legged, short-bodied men who are deceptive when in a
chair. The two mild men in the rear of the procession
took one glance at him as he uncoiled himself,
skipped silently down the stair, and then ran their hardest
for the nearest pub. But the lady, having no idea that
her supporters had deserted her, still faced the enemy.
“Sir,” she said, waving the whip, “you are a ruffian
“ Madam,” interrupted the editor, “ if you touch me with
that thing I’ll” Just then the whip came down. The
man of letters jumped for his enemy and got a second cut
—across the face this time—as he reached her. Then he
possessed himself of the whip, pinned the lady by th.e
neck with her face to the wall, and for two minutes the
proceedings consisted wholly of “swish.” Finally she
broke away and escaped down the stairs, and the editor
went back to finish his leading article on the Eastern
Question. That actress is never known to have assaulted
even the smallest editor since then, and has taken many
adverse criticisms in a humble spirit and with exemplary
patience.
It is alleged that Walter Baker, some 14 years ago, got
£25 reward for chasing a burglar four miles through the
bush at Dubbo (N.S.W.), and effecting his single-handed
capture. Though he is a good deal older and stouter, he
could do the same feat now, if called upon. Continuous
pursuit of Albert Norman through the wilderness of the
six-act drammer does a lot to keep Baker in condition.
When Fitzgeralds’ Circus crossed the Queensland border

animals had to come through in their former infested
condition An attempt to persuade him to dip the tiee>-
also failed. If the tick does get into N.S.W., that per-
functory inspector will be distinctly responsible.

fluttering in uncanny dresses, and with grotesque, dis-
hevelled hair, looking like a distracted banshee going
home with the milk. Scores of the girls of the suburb
have caught the Potter stare and the Potter straddle,
and they let their hair run wild and catch it back in a
reckless manner, cultivate pale yellow complexions and
eerie hats and lunatic gowns, and canter around, re-
sembling so many dyspeptic hens that have mislaid an
egg.”
Old friend Genevieve Ward plays Margaret of Anjou in
Irving’s revival of 11 Richard 111. This is the “ Richard
III.” that Shakespeare built (not Colley Cibber’s version),
in which Queen Margaret curses at large, and perfidious
Clarence declaims his awfuldream. Itisalways an interest-
ing production on account of the people who, knowing all
the Colley Cibber gags by heart, stare astonished at
Richard when he doesn’t cry “ Off with his head-so
much for Buckingham ! ” but merely answers “ That’s the
best news of all.”
Haresfoot: “Williamson and Musgrove’s programme
for ’97 is mostly a plunge into the romantic drama, with
the ‘ Prisoner of Zenda,’ ‘ Under the Red Robe,’ and
other pieces which have been tremendous London hits,
including the ‘Two Little Vagabonds.’ A Gaiety company
of some kind is also probable. The ‘ Artist’s Model,’ the
‘ Gay Parisienne,’ the ‘Little Genius,’ the ‘White Silk
Dre-s,’ and other successful plays of that kind should also
go well after their light and frivolous fashion in Australia.
Quite a torrent of new faces will be poured in ’97 on the
Princess’s stage.”

Spagnoletti : “ Leoni Clark’s Cat Show makes me think

exclaiming, ‘No more performance to-day. Only hunget
drives them to it.’ ”
There is an unwritten melodramatic canon which
decrees that the hero shall not smoke on the stage. The
cigarette is as necessary an adjunct to a stage villain as
evening dress and a top hat. The giddy society girl, the
panto, principal boy, the idiotic Johnny, the gay adven-
turess, and sometimes the heroine (as in “Trilby”)
indulge in a whiff. But the miserable hero, in almost
every case, is out of it.
Zangwill on the actor : “ Actors are not even parrots-
they are automatic puppets that move their limbs in fixed
fashions, and make squeaking sounds at prescribed
moments. There was a French Ministf r of Education
who drew up a most rigid time-code, which hung in his
bureau ; and it was the joy of his life to take out his
watch and say, ‘ Half-past three ! Ha! every boy in
France is now' learning geography’; or, ‘A quarter to
twelve ! Ha ! every French schoolgirl is now writing in a
copy-book.' I have the same sort of feeling about my
actor acquaintances. ‘Half-past nine? Ah! what is
Herbert doing? He is taking poison.’ ‘A quarter to
eleven ! Dear me ! Rose is craw ling under a table.’ And
these creatures want every privilege, forsooth! Fame,
gold, champagne, the best society and the worst. To be
of Bohemia and Belgravia, to make the best of both
worlds. If things don’t mend, to sit in a stall will soon
become an index of imbecility. It will be like being seen
at the Academy.”
“ Robbery Under Arms ” was recently played at Dundee
(Scotland), where a sad Scotch audience took it seriously
as a true story of modern Australia.
Trouble is apparently brewing between
the associated marine engineers and the Australian
steamship owners. The Association asked the
other day for more pay and other things, whereon
the owners bombarded every individual engineer
with a circular which instructed him to state at
once whether this beastly request met with his
approval, and significantly warned him to “give
the matter your most serious consideration before
jeopardising your position in the most highly-paid
shipping service in the world.” The engineers
rather objected to beihg menaced and cut off in
detail like this, and things at time of writing Were
sultry. The right of 24 hours’ notice to leave is
the best weapon—almost the only weapon—the
engineers have. It puts employers face-to-face
with this dilemma : they must heat the men’s
protests or lay up their ships—thebe is no time to
hire blacklegs. So, when the s.s. Wollowra’s
engineers in Adelaide, the other day, gave 24
hours’ notice, the wrath of the Adelaide Shipping
Co. was boundless. “Notify the Wollowra engi-
neers,” wired the co.’s secretary, “on behalf of
the co., that the current agreement with their
institute continues till 24th February. Summarily
terminating the same constitutes a gross and
dishonorable breach, and their conduct in desert-
ing their ship is disloyal to their employers
and unbecoming as officers, subversive of
all discipline, and a shocking example to
the crew, besides reducing their institute
to the level of an ordinary trades-union.”
The men were obviously within their legal rights,
or the co. would not have fallen to abuse. It is
amazed that its employees will not make war on
terms which will ensure it a victory. And the
fine old fetish-words “honor” and “loyalty”—
the claptrap which has justified currishness
and servility in every generation—are invoked on
behalf of Fat Man wounded in his tender pocket.
The engineers will reduce their institute “to the
level of an ordinary trades-union” —the trades-
union which has done all the fighting, has won all
the victories, has made independent labor possible
and tyranny difficult and odious ! In the annals
of struggling Toil there is no prouder position
than that—on “the level of an ordinary trades-
union.”

The Wild-Cat Column,
Treasurer Reid, of N.S.W., evidently intends
making 1 a great effort to get 18 months’ land and income
tax into the present financial year, and the ukase has
gone forth that all return' are to be sent iri on or before
lebruary 5. Considering that the Department is still
snowed up under a mountain of appeals and isn’t likely
to get last year’s land-tax put reasonably straight before
March, and also that some even of the Sydney and
suburban notices for last year haven’t been received
yet, this looks a little previous. The landmarks of G.
Reid’s finance are an interesting study. He came into
office about the middle of 1894, and the shortage for that
year he alleged to be entirely caused by his wicked pre-
decessors. For the half-year ended 3l)th June, 1895, Reid
first claimed a surplus ; then it turned out, by his own
statement in Parliament, that the deficit was £149,000,
while the Auditor-General showed it as £186,000.
The Auditor-General convicted Reid of trying to swell nis
accounts and so produce a surplus for himself and
a partially bogus deficit for his predecessor by including
some £400,000 belonging to past years as part of the
current revenue. This was about the worst thing of
which a N.S.W. Treasurer was ever convicted, and
it says a lot for G. Reid’s assurance and the som-
nolence of his constituents that it didn’t smash him
utterly. Next, for the financial year which ended 30th
June, 1896 —the first complete year’s accounts presented
by the present N.S.W. Treasurer—the alleged surplus
was £330,000, and the real deficit, as shown by the
Government Statistician (“Seven Colonies” for 1896 j page
363) was £635,000, so the discrepancy between the two
sets of figures was close on £1,000,090. The peculiar
dodge on this occasion was the “ cash basis ” device, by
which nearly a million of the year’s ordinary outlay was
added to the floating debt and not charged against
revenue at all. The next that was distinctly heard about
Treasurer Reid’s finance was a month ago, when it ap-
peared that the expenditure for the first five months of
the financial year was already £168,000 ahead of the
revenue. At the end of the six months the shortage reached
£336,000. The device by which the surplus is to be pro-
duced or the deficit minimised at 30th June, 1897, is
already obvious, and consists in collecting one-half
of the land and income taxes in advance, and thus
shoving part of the 1898 revenue into 1897. How the
dodge for 1898 will be worked is a mystery, but
probably Reid expects to be out of office by that
time, and to leave the trouble to his successor, while he
sits by and tells how much better he did things. The
land and income tax being already paid partly in advance
can hardly, then, be collected further in advance. The
“ cash basis ” idea by which a lot of the year's expenditure
is charged to next year will also be usod .up. The other
“ cash basis ” idea of charging a lot of 1 Current expen-
diture back to the “ Dibbs deficit ” will „e played out by
then. It is hardly possible to drag another £400,000 or
so of loan-money into revenue on the strength of an
alleged bookkeeping mistake of 10 or 20 years back. Alto-
gether it looks as if G. Reid was getting near the end of
his financial “ fakes,” and by another 12 or 18 months he
should be quite at the end of them.

The New South Wales revenue for the half-year
ended 31st December is £228,074 worse than that for the
corresponding period of 1895. But if the customs duties
had remained as they were in 1895, and the land and
income taxes hadn’t been imposed, it is reckoned that,
other things being equal, there would have been an in-
crease of £47,000. The loan money spent on works
during the half-year has been £719,939, or at the rate of
nearly £1,440,000 a year. This is considerably more than
the rate for the last two years, though even then the
borrowed money curse went on at the rate of over IJ4
millions per annum. It seems to be an unwritten law in
N.S.W. that a million to I>4 million of borrowed money
must be got through annually, and, as the population
doesn’t increase at quite the same ratio as the borrow-
ings, the debt per head gets a shade bigger every year.

The Victorian revenue for the six months just
ended is £118,827 better than for the half ended Decem-
ber, ’95, and as the abolition of the primage duties in-
volved a loss of £43,000, the increase, on last year’s basis,
should have been about £162,000. This is the iirst notable
improvement since ’B9.
» * » *
Tasmania’s revenue for the year is .£45,000
better than for 1895.
* * * •
Treasurer Fysh, of Tasmania, reports in a proud
tone of voice that his surplus will probably be £70,000.
Considering that last year Tasmania charged £llO,OOO of
ordinary expenditure to loans, it certainly should have a
surplus. In fact, seeing how beautifully simple it is to
pay ordinary ex.’s out of loan funds, there is absolutely
no reason why the surplus shouldn’t be £790,000 instead
of only £70,000.

Once a year or so Victoria issues a list of its

those which don’t pay working expenses; lot No. 2 pay
expenses, but don’t fully cover interest on cost of con-
struction ; No. 3 yield a profit over and above working
expenses and interest. Every now and then a line crawls
successfully out of list No. 1 and into No. 2, and
there is gladness all round. Then the country watches
with breathless interest its snail-like progress through
No. 2 list into No. 3. The Beechworth-Yackandandah
line is now within £33 of getting out of No. 1 list alto-
gether, and the Murtoa-Hopetoun line has just struggled
out of No. 2 and got into the paying category. That
awful noise in the distance is the Vic. Treasurer cheering
himself hoarse as a consequence.

The S.A. State Bank, the best-managed con-
cern of its kind up to date, has now made advances
amounting to £llO,OOO, and approved of £65,000 more.
Applications are coming in at the rate of 70 to 80 a day.
Also, the institution has paid expenses from the start, the
f>remium at which its bonds were sold covering all pre-
iininary charges. A State Bank which pays its way from
the first day of its existence is something for Kingston to
be proud of.

The National Mutual Life Association has just
finished a much better year than some it has recently ex-
perienced. The renewal premiums (£190,919) were £3OOO
better than last year, and new premiums ( £22,816) showed
an improvement of £4OOO. Also there was a remarkable
rise in the interest on investments, the receipts under
this head being £79,071, or £BOOO more than they were in
1895. This means a total improvement of £15,000 in the
income as compared with last year. The interest on in-
vested funds, which sank to 471 per cent, in ’95, rose
again in 1896 to 4*91 per cent., and the working expenses
dropped about ten shillings per cent. Also one or two
other agreeable things happened. The amount added to
the funds (£102,168) was £7OOO more than last year’s
saving, and the funds now stand at £1,662,391. Also the
reserve for depreciation has been raised from £35,000 to
£70,000, which is an eminently wise precaution. Taking
everything into account, the National Mutual has done
unusually well in every respect.
The assets leave no very great room for com-
plaint. Accrued interest represents about £14,000, and,
as nothing at all is said about interest in arrear, it is pre-
sumably lumped in with the “accrued.” In that case,
the amount seems moderate enough, though the details
might be a little clearer, and it would appear that the
assets are sufficiently sound and paying up the
interest with that regularity which holds forth
promise of the principal being all right. The
National Mutual has apparently sold out its hold-
ing of Government securities and is going in chiefly
for mortgages, which may or may not be wise policy, ft
has £70,000 invested in Victorian building society shares —
the name of the society or societies, as usual, doesn’t
appear, and the amount is steadily increasing. Pre-
sufnably, however, the £70,000 isn’t in any of the
more awful institutions. Also “ deferred instalments
of annual premiums in force ” still appears as an
asset to the amount of £45,000, and further debate as to
the value of this item is hereby held over. At all events,
the large increase in the business done, the improved
rate of interest realised, the reduction of expenses, and
the handsome addition made to the reserve fund are all
signs of prosperity and good management.

Melbourne Perpetual Trustees and Executors
Association, whose balance-sheet comes to light some-
what late in the day, has a profit of £B5 for the year
ended 30th September, equal to 6s. percent, per annum.
Last year there was a loss of £197, and the previous year
a loss of £204, so things are not quite so bad as they were.
Still, they are bad enough. The reserve-fund of £lO,OOO
vanishes suddenly ; £3777 is written off to cover depreci-
ation, and £6223 carried to a contingency account in case
of more depreciation coming to light. The co. has £38,000
of its own cash invested (610,000 in State securities, and
the rest mostly in mortgages), and assuming this yields
3J4 per cent, all round—a very moderate estimate indeed
—it would seem that the Trustee business is an actual
loss of about £1250. Under these circumstances it would
surely be better to give up the Trustee business altogether
or else amalgamate. Things are doubtless improving in
Melbourne, but it may easily take 10 or 15 years before
that city is again in a position to keep its five trust com-
panies going profitably, and the dead horse some of them
are working off will be in a dreadful state of decomposi-
tion by then. Dead horse doesn’t keep well in this hot
climate.

That big trading concern, James M‘Ewan and
Co., Limited, publishes a balance-sheet with a lot of thrill
in it. Total loss for the year over £12,000. Business
didn’t cover working expenses and bad debts, and conse-
quently debenture interest is all dead loss. Accumulated
shortage in the assets £117,000, equal to 30 per cent, of
the capital; £lOO,OOO of capital to be written off as lost.
No dividend.
* * * »
Melb. Storage Co. states that it has made a loss
of * 270 for the half-year, and puts in the same gladsome
footnote as in last balance-sheet to the effect that the
freehold property niust be regarded as a liability rather
than an asset. Said property is set down at a book-value
of £103,000 less a mortgage of £53,000, so that it is a
nominal asset of £55,000. As the footnote evidently
means that it isn’t now worth the mortgage money, it
apparently follows that this nominal asset is at present
purely bogus, and in that case it would appear by the
figures that the co. is insolvent, its paid-up capital and
reserves not being enough to cover the deficit. The Melb.
Storage Co, seems to have almost the only absolutely
candid and truthful directorate in this country just now.

At the end of December there were 26,530 tons
of American grain and 17,960 tons of American and Chinese
flour afloat for Sydney alone. Yet the present harvest is
an abundant one, and the population has gone on the
land so much more than usual that N.S. Wales, for the
first time since it began to have agricultural statistics, can
fully supply its own requirements. With nearly two
months’ extra supply being dumped into the province,
saying nothing of possible future shipments, some inter-
esting results should ensue.

In 1889, auction sales of real estate in Sydney

1892, £1,500,000; 1893, £950,000; 1894, £700,000 ; 1895,
£560,000 ; 1896, £450,000. What do Sydney auctioneers

Bennet and Woolcock, Limited (Melb.), a large
concern in the meat, wool, and tallow line, states that its
loss for last year is £8452. The capital is £40,000 and
reserve only £lOOO, so this means a-fifth of the entire co.
vanished in one year, as a sort of Xmas box for share-
holders. Further, two of the assets which represent the
alleged £40,000 capital are net loss up to date £7829, and
goodwill, £11,500. Naturally £11,500 is about a fair thing
for the goodwill of a concern which is £7829 to the bad.

The “coal ring” whose existence has been so
often denied, was evidently a pretty solid reality a few
years ago. In 1889 the average price of coal at New-
castle (N.S. W.) was Bs. lid. per ton, and the lowest price
at which the Victorian Government could obtain house
coal by tender was 265. 6d. In 1894 the price at New-
castle had gone down to 6s. 4d., a drop of 2s. 7d. per ton ;
but the price at which it was offered to the Vic. Govern-
ment was 13s. Id., a decline of no less than 13s. sd. Con-
sequently, the Treasurer reckons that the “ ring,” until it
was forced down by the pressure of local competition,
“ had ” Victoria for 10s. 6d. per ton, and would probably
have it again for the same amount if the Victorian mines
could be closed up. In those good old days the ring
decided which of its members should get a certain tender
and at what price, and, as no other member competed
against him, he naturally got it. The old coffin-ship
which wheezed with its big coal cargo along the coast
used to earn its oats those times. Now it makes little
more than engine-grease and expenses.

Out of <£95,118 received in S.A. as income-tax

ing each over £2200 annually from personal exertion, and
£23,064 from 70 persons who derive more than £2200 a
vear each from property. Persons receiving less than
£3OO a year yield £17,926, and the total number of
income-taxpayers is 14,012. The exemption in 1896 was
£125, and this has been raised to £lso—a change which
will involve a loss of £7OOO a year.

Brown’s Creek mine (N.S.W.) is a scene of
desolation. The new 60-head Fraser and Chalmers’

his crowd, must have gone down for at least £30,000 over

that I cannot see what gold it carries, and it is the best I
ever saw in the mine.” This is a N.S.W. mine report. If
it appeared in Bendigo there would be a big rush to catch
the manager before he did any further injury. The cir-
cumstance of the local editor printing it would be put
down to Chris-hic-mus !

The North has now the most attention from the
touts on the B.H. field. Its shaft, from which a long
western crosscut has been unsuccessfully put in, with the
object of picking up the Junction and Junction North
body, is declared to be too centrally situated for the pur-
pose, and the exploration is now being carried on from the
Junction North’s most northerly workings. Up to within
a few feet of the North boundary good sulphide ore has
been carried ; and there seems to be every probability
that it will be followed into the North’s ground.
The course of the lode and its value are, how-
ever, most uncertain hereabout : if it extend into the
North it will be plain that a huge displacement of the lode
has occurred, and the elbow theory to account for the
rich deposit in the Junction will be sustained. But in the
region of such disturbances persistent bodies of rich ore
are not to relied upon. Even in the Junction and
Junction North the lode—or, more strictly speak-
ing, bunch —cannot be relied upon further than
the eye can see. Block 10 has such another
bunch (only of very rich kaolin), and it disap-
peared as dramatically as it “ made.” On the whole,
therefore, it will not be a very reassuring thing for the
Junction and Junction North if the lode does turn back
into the North ; while, as for the Junction Consolidated,
Silver Hill Junction and that group, it will be a very un-
pleasant development indeed.
Even if the North does get it, the rapid under-
lay to the west (out of the North ground, that is) must be
kept in mind. On the whole, then, and notwithstanding
the sharp advance in Norths, the present writer would
prefer to tip the winner of next Melb. Cup than, upon
present knowledge, to advise investment in any particular
mine of the Junction-North-Consolidated group. One
thing, though : nothing that this exploratory work dis-
closes ought to advance either Junction or Junction North
shares; for their values have been determined in a market
which all along has pooh-poohed the idea of the rich ore
passing back into the North.
* * • •
The Junction North has entered into contracts
for 1897 for the supply of 500 tons of high-grade ore
weekly ; and there are also arrangements for the supply
of lower-grade stuff. The haulage of ore is now simplified
through improvements in the shaft.
* » * *
The Junction’s new machinery will be grinding
away later on this month, when it will be possible to con-
serve the higher grade ore a little more, and still pay the
monthly div.

What sulphide treatment has done : Junction
shares began 1895 at Is. 4d. ; closed It9l at 605., touching
89s. between times. Junction North, unsaleable at the
opening of 1895, closed 1896 at 305., and touched 365. in
Aug. Block 10, opening at 55., went to 865., and closed
at 635. 6d. The least variation was in B.H. Proprietaries,
which opened 1895 at 365. 6d., went to 635. in Feb., 1896,
and closed the year at 50s. But, then, the B.H. Proprie-
tary is not exclusively a sulphide-mine.

The output of ore for local and seaboard smelt-

this the Broken Hill Prop, is responsible for approxi-
mately 9000 tons, Block 14 for 2750 tons, Block 10 for
nearly 2000 tons, the British 2500 tons, the Junction 1500
tons, the South 1000 tons, and the Junction North and
North most of the balance.

That almost infallible mining authority, the
Sabbath tipster, says: “It is much to be deplortd that
Sydney has not entered into the W.A. mining business to
any great extent. Adelaide absorbs most of the good
things, but there is no reason why we should not also be
participators of some of the richness which will come
eastward from Kalgoorlie and Menzies. People who are
not eaten up with pessimisim, and who are really in a
position to judge, from personal observation, do not hesi-
tate to state that the output of W.A. goldfields will be
enormously increased during the current year.” But
that was exactly what was said this time last year, and
the year before. Adelaide has three or four of the good
things—there are not many altogether. It has also more
than 20 “cats” to one g'old-mine, and the stench there-
from is so bad that the chief business this year will be the
liquidator’s burial service. Sydney has kept fairly out of
the business, and little wonder. Everything it touched,
with one solitary exception—and many thousands have
been sent W.A.-wards—has proved a hopeless failure.
The list is a fairly long one, too.

Speight, ex-Vic. Chief Railway Commissioner,
is in Melb. with a scheme for running light tramways
around the mines to enable low-grade ores to be taken
down the Coolgardie line for treatment where there is
plenty of fuel and water. The thing reads well—like
every prospectus. Probably there are a few mines in the
country that would pay worked on this system, but the
“ white quartz” mines of Westralia —and they are mostly
that —are either rich enough to stand all the natural con-
ditions of mining in the country, or are too poor to pay
under any conditions. There was more gold in a ton of
ore from the rich streak in Bayley’s reef than in 1000 tons
of the almost barren quartz beside it. So with the Lon-
donderry, Wealth of Nations, and a score of other W.A.
mines which have batteries but no payable ore to crush.

Modest Maryanski, having left for London, is
escaping the hostile criticism thrown at him in reference
to the discovery of tellurium at Kalgoorlie. The heavy
telluride talk had ceased altogether when M.M. got out
there, and he was evidently under the impression his
was the first find, whereas tellurium had been found many
months before, in Block 45 and elsewhere. What has
become of all the other rich telluride finds is quite
another question. M.M.’s declaration that the presence
of tellurium is proof of the permanency and rich-
ness of mines, etc., rather shows him not the man he
is cracked up to be. The world’s experience is in the
opposite direction. There are only one or two places in
the world where gold is worked in the form of tellurium,
though its occasional presence has been observed in a
great many mines. Already the experience of Kalgoorlie
has apparently been sufficient to show that if the field
had to depend on the gold in its telluride ores it would be
a case of—Uordelpit !

Frazer’s mine, Southern Cross, W.A., 900 tons,
5600 z. Quite good enough. Many hundred times have
the Southern Cross mines been thrown at the public as
argument in favor of low-grade mining in that waterless
waste, of which Southern Cross is an average sample, or
a sample not much above the average. Yet the explana-
tion is simple enough. The lake at this camp is about
enough to keep two or three mines running by pumping.
There are only two or three mines running. Had they
found more mines, or had the public been fool enough to
work lizard’ blocks the water would be scarce all round
as it is m other places.

■ Disowned. The public of Perth are warned
that the Mt. Malcolm Proprietary mine (W.A.) is often
confounded with a Mt. Malcolm mine whose shares are
about a penny. It has no connection with it, and the
public are asked to see that they get the right brand.
The Proprietary is not without troubles of a financial
kind. Some one has cleared with the ready cash. Still
the nune is said to be all right, which is more than can be
said of the Sydney-owned Mt. Malcolm.

The beginning of the end. Hit or Miss South
nune, W.A. First call, 67,000 shares forfeited ; no funds
in hand, and the chairman appealed to the meeting, held
in Brisbane this week, to pay up or the mine was liable to
be jumped after the 16th, when the exemption expired.
It was decided to appeal to the paid-up holders to come
to the rescue and keep the thing alive. Better let it die,
considering the collapsing condition of the Hit or Miss
mine itself, on the strength of which the South was
floated. Lady Lamirigton -another Brisbane-owned W.A.
mine in the same trouble; 18,000 shares forfeited. The
funds in the bank will allow the fun to go on a little
longer. There will be more W.A. mines floundered than
floated in ’97.

Published in Perth that the Murchison goldfield
has now 345 head of stampers at work, that the yield this
year will exceed last by r 35,0000 z., and that, after a longer
trial than Coolgardie, the field is beginning to reward
those who retained their faith in it. Three to four years
is a long time to wait for the beginning of a reward. The
alleged 345 stamps should crush about 1000 tons of ore a
day, which, at an oz. to the ton, the average of Charters
Towers, will exceed its output. Yet the Towers this year
put out as much gold Westralia altogether.
Meeting of the Golden Lode syndicate recently
held at Kanowna. W.A. : “The chairman reported they
were convinced that the gold in the dump did not come
from the lode, but had been placed there by some un-
known means ; therefore, the new find, of which so much
had been said, did not exist.” Reefers’ Eureka, Kal-
goorlie : “ The directors have received information that
the two zones of country of great width, and reported to
be worth an oz. to the ton all through, did not carry any
gold, and the stone sent from the mine had been salted.
This had been confirmed by an examination made by Mr.
Maitland.”

A real boom cyclone struck the sandy
township of Nevertire —near Gehenna (N.S.W.)
the other day, and the single enthusiastic
resident who spoke of Nevertire as a rising
place found it falling simultaneously about
him in all directions. Churches and liquor
stores fled across the dusty plains together
in brotherhood and left their fragments spread
over a vast area, and there is a legend of a
J.P. who flew 15 miles on a sheet of galvanised-
iron and landed on the top of a telegraph-
post, whence he sent a wire to Premier Reid
announcing the disaster and stating that the
increasing difficulty in finding people to shout
drinks for the honorary magistracy was the lion
CROWDED OUT.
“Do you think my voice filled the room?”
“By the way the people came on the verandah, I should say it overcrowded it.”
rn the path of federation. With this exception,
the cyclone doesn’t appear to have done anything
to be particularly proud of—unless it was hitting
Nevertire in the first instance. Many other
cyclones have fired round Australia at intervals,
but none of them ever succeeded in shooting a
township before—probably because Australian
townships are so scarce ahd lonesome that it takes
a great deal of practice to go anywhere near them.
When this expansive country gets thickly popu-
lated the cyclone will probably insist on having
every Sunday out, as it were.
* * * *
The unreasoning perversity with which
Providence wantonly destroys the earthly mansion
of the collection-plate and the stentorian iron bell
was sadly illustrated at Nevertire during the
tornado. Ihe two churches m that now much-
disseminated township were carried away bodily
by the wind and distributed over the adjacent
landscape in the form of fire-lighters. Of the
two hotels one was partially wrecked, but in the
case of the other it is melancholy to read that
“ the bar portion of the hotel was not touched.”
The need of a good, reliable arrangement by
which the churches will always remain unscathed
while the wicked pub. is blown to matchwood is
becoming more apparent every day.

A fearsome case has just struck Sydney in
the form of a German libel-suit. One Roth last
week proceeded against Arno Thierman on a
charge of sending him a post-card on which was
written in staggerful characters the words “ hoch-
stappler and betreuger.” These terms, com-
plainant meant “arch swindler and
thief, impostor, cheat, deceiver,” and other
calumny. Large numbers of German importers
(they all seem to be importers) gave evidence as to
the awful character-blasting strength of hoch-
stappler and betreuger, and defendant was com-
mitted for trial. Evidently hochstappler and
betreuger are words of many ton objurgation in
the Vaterland.

The first woman ever arrested in Australia
for being tight in knickerbockers was fined the
other day at a Sydney police-court.

A voice from the far West. Out by the
Dawson a dead man was reported with two horses,
presumably his property, feeding close by. The
usual policeman went out and disposed of the
remains and reported : “I buried the remains,
yer Washup, and brought in the horses.” “ What
sort of man do you think he was ? ” “He was a
rejoosed gentleman, yer Washup, and accustomed
to luxuries. He had a fork in his swag, yer
Washup.”
Apropos the
eternal question of
the police-court
Bible as a source
of infection, two
copies of Holy Writ
are in use in the
Broken Hill court.
Some official hav-
ing a due regard
for the truth has
written inside the
covers of one :
“ Germ Distribu-
tor,” “Disease Dis-
seminator,” “Filth
Collector,” and
“ The Doctor’s De-
light ; ” and of the
other : “ Microbe
Pad ” and “Cancer
Spreader.”

It was Simon
Fraser, in Vic. Leg.
Council, who advo-
cated the sending
of two very small
boys—aged 5 and
7 respectively to
gaol for assault, on
the ground that
prison discipline
would tend to
“make men of
them.” The force
of which argument
depends entirely
upon Simon Fra-
ser’s interpretation
of the term ‘‘ Man.”
Does he mean that
the infants would
emerge from dur-
ance vile with a
strong determina-
tion to grow rich
and get 1000-gui-
nea portraits of
themselves painted

lais ?

Sample Westralian summer-

“ Why, he has had the body of his
wife in his tent for the last month,
and neither police nor magistrate
can get him to remove it.” “Good
Heavens, what’s his reason?”

Hamilton (Vic.) Borough
Council lately refused the prayer of
307 ratepayers to be allowed to hear
a band play sacred music in the
public gardens on Sunday evening.
Hamilton is a place where loose-
haired females with no teeth bang
tambourines on Sunday to the
tune of “When Johnny Comes
Marching Home Again,” and fish-
eyed men with triangular skulls flop
imprecations at the Deity to a cor-
net accompaniment of “ The Man
that Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo ” ; but the Council isn’t going
to be immoral enough to let Sabbath
ears be polluted by Haydn and
Beethoven.
Second verse of the first “ war song ” on a
hymn sheet distributed by Maoriland Cold Tea
Party, just before the poll, on the drink question—
Whatever thy danger,
Take heed and beware,
But turn not thy back
For no armor is there.
The prohibitionist’s lack of protection against
Maoriland kickers goes to show that Ironsand
Smith has ample reason for his determination to
melt Taranaki into pig-iron or die in the attempt.
“ If it is not a dirty business,” yelled the
Temperance orator, “ why do you license it ? You
don’t license your butchers or bakers or grocers or
drapers.” Small voice from the back seat: “ But
you do license yer auctioneers.” And the Cold-
Tea man grew very red.

Holdar M. : “The tale of the Chinese
alleged convert and his instructress has been told
before-whilst deadly indifference prevails it can-
not be too often repeated. The other after-
noon, in a Sydney suburb, the yellow
man and his dear Christian tnends
went out on a muggy - muggy
razzle. Two wide circles, thickly
packed with Chow, white girl and
Mongrel, conducted operations to
an atrocious chant of “A-hunting
we will go.” The principles of the
pastime baffled the writer’s grasp,
but the effects were sufficiently ap-
parent. Teacher and pupil grabbed
each other with a great grab, and
suddenly bouncing round in oppo-
site directions embraced some more
brother and sister with fervent con-
fusion. A stiff north-easter dis-
playing quantities of female under-
wear heightened the spectacular
value of the romp, and the male
Klistian’s orbs fairly twinkled with
appreciation. White women, beside
their Celestial consorts, sat around
suckling their piebald progeny,
while envious onlookers of the
‘ push ’ variety were kept at a dis-
creet distance, and seemed to feel
the position acutely. One plump
and frolicsome maiden presently
collapsed ignominiously in the ring’s
centre amidst the coily caehinna-
tions of the Yellowskin, several of
whom bounded to the rescue of
their flounce-entangled Missee. It
became time to quit the hybrid
horror. ”
Melb. Women’s Hospital pharisai-
cally bleats that its staff, in proportion to
the patients treated, is larger than that of
any other similar charity in Australasia. As
it admittedly works its nurses over 12$ hours
per day, and gives them only half a day off per
week, it is, on the face of it, a sweater and a
whited sepulchre, and, if its staff are best off,
what must the condition of the Florence Night-
ingales of other hospitals be like ?

One day last week, at 1 o’clock p.m., with
the glass showing about 98' in the shade, there
stood in front of aYork-st. church three beautifully-
groomed parsons, all fit, so far as external appear-

JOHNNIE: “ Never mind, don't cry — p’r'aps she aint!”
or something like that. Within a few yards a
blind, sun-dried mendicant, ragged and hungry-
looking, was trying to gauge his proximity to the
kerb with a view to crossing. They saw him not
(they never do). But the blasphemous cabman
from the adjacent stand left his seat and gently
ushered the poor tramp across the road.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The nodding plumes steal slowly by,
Fair women turn their heads aside—
And yet the purest there must die
As poor love Leila died.
In town, a boy who never knew
Of better love than this
Is mourning Leila’s eyes of blue,
And lone for Leila’s kiss.
A horseman on the burning plains
A hundred miles north west
Bends gently o’er his bridle-reins
And prays for Leila : “Rest.”
A man who buried all his dreams
Of Love long years ago,
Has dropped one other tear where gleams
Love-Leila’s breast of snow.
All virtuous the world appears—
But those who turn aside
May never win such honest tears
As fell when Leila died.

Steal silent out before the wine is done,
But others entering take their chairs, and so
The feast ne’er flags howe’er they come and go.

Publichouse acknowledged to be “the leavings
from the glasses. Every barman in every land
knows, or ought to know, that it’s a common cus-
tom of the trade ”to empty all the drainings
ostensibly into a sink, but really into a cask. They
all go in together—brandy, whisky, rum, gin,
beer, shandygaff, wine—everything takes its
chance. The cask is a lottery, for no one knows
how the contents will turn out; it depends on
which drink predominates and oh the weather and
the rats and other things. But everything comes
in handy for blending purposes, and many strange
accidental drinks come out of that cask. Mostly
they are awful or worse, but now and then it pans
out for a wonderful liquor, the recipe of which is
always lost, for no one ever knows how much
whisky and how much gin and rat and stale beer
is in the compound, and how stale the beer is, or
whether the cigar-ash which got into it was Cuban
or Manilla or Mexican. The cask in the cellar is
the most absolutely uncertain gamble on record,
and the drinker unconsciously bets his stomach on
it, and mostly loses.

Melbourne is full of dead churches. They
are of all denominations except the Catholic ; it
is one of the cast-iron principles of the astute
Roman never to run in debt or mortgage the
sacred fane in any way, and therefore his is the
only tabernacle that isn’t going broke. But the
other sects are in a bad way. Bishop Goe wants
to abandon St. James’s. Torrance endeavors to
galvanise the half-dead St. John’s, but John’s is
evidently past saving. The Presbyterian Chalmers
Church, and the Ramsey Church, Collins-street,
botli big places with towering spires, have knocked
under. John Knox Church, Swanston-street, has
been sold cheap to a rival sect, and St. Andrew’s
is about as dead as it can be. Wesley Church is
a horrid white elephant. The Independents have
slaughtered two churches—that large one in
Lonsdale-street East, now a tin-factory, and the
still larger and finer Eastern Hill church. “ This
desirable tabernacle to let cheap ” will soon be a
common, everyday advt. in the city of Smellboom.

Melbourne is going to be purified on Social
Gimlet lines. All the seats in dark corners of the
parks and gardens are to be removed and placed
in the light, so that the social purists can get a
better view. The social purity crowd consists
largely of ladies, some of them quite young ladies,
and one of their duties is to go round the gardens
after dark, and, in the words of a lady-member,
“see sights which would make the worst woman
blush.” If they didn’t belong to the Society for
the Prevention of Immorality they couldn’t go
and see those things and be respectable ; being
members they can. And thus the girl-graduates
learn quite a lot of undraped facts which they
wou'd otherwise have to find out by reading Zola.
In Hobart,
recently, two
workmen were
coming home
late and saw the
roof of a mansion
on fire. One
climbed up the
verandah and
started to beat
out the flames,
while the other
rang the bell.
One of Hobart’s
principal society
dames came
down in her
dressing- gown
and realised the
situation ; like-
wise she found
that the clothes
of the man on
the roof were
completely ruin-
ed. In a burst
of enthusiasm
and thanks she
offered them a
shilling between
them after the
fire had been
thoroughly ex-
tinguished. The
next Hobart
mansion that
takes fire will
probably be al-
lowed to blaze,
so far as the
local toiler is
concerned.

At Wellington (M.L.) election, the other
day, a large, frowsy girl with reddish hair walked
up to the returning-officer with a note from that
free and independent elector, her mother. It
read : “ I ain’t got no boots, so can’t come to the
pole. Please let Sally vote forme.” It was ex-
plained that the Act, unfortunately, wasn’t built
that way, so the bootless parent’s suffrage was
lost.

A would-be contributor lately called on
the proprietor of an Australian magazine to learn
the fate of a 20-page MS. which he had blasted
out of his inner soul after three weeks’ labori-
ous thought. “Yes,” said the proprietor, “I
like your story very much and will put it in.”
“And about payment?” timidly insinuated the
author. “Why, you don’t expect to be paid

dubious, and there was a pause. Then the pro-
prietor rubbed his chin and said slowly : “I will
give you £1 on publication.” The writer sadly
shook his head. Another pause, and the proprie-
tor, with sudden animation, leaned across his desk
and said in a triumphant whisper: “See here,
I’ll buy it for ss. cash down.” And yet people
wonder why authors take to drink. It is the
cheapest thing an author can take to.

A sign of the times. An extensive meat
purveyor at Darling Harbor (Sydney) has posted
outside his office a notice: “No meat will be
given away for one month.”
“Speaking broad-
ly,” says Allan Laidlaw,
in the Free Review,
“all women may be
considered dangerous
who have prominent
cheek - bones, or
markedly aquiline noses,
or too sanguine com-
plexions. Beware of
women with small, nar-
row, obliquely-set eyes,
or eyes set too close to-
gether. Full-lipped
girls, prematurely volup-
tuous, are not safe for
marriage, being too sala-
cious for one man’s ser-
vice, Foxy - haired
women are too often im-
measureably deceitful.
Very amiable women
are, asa rule, shallow and
cold-hearted. ... It is
difficult to say whether
the confirmed coquette
or the perfect prude be
the more dangerous.
As a fact, the frank,
open, hearty woman is
the most chaste ; but the
depths of the reserved
and secretive woman are
unfathomable. Yet men
are attracted by the
false modesty of the
reserved woman and
misjudge the free
manners of a
woman of cha-
racter, who
may be cap-
able of one
great pas-
sion but has
no morbid
sexuality to
prompt loose
fancies.”
Ladies may
now take this
par. to the
looking - glass
and read it all
over again.
N. : “ Incredible,
but true, that last Sun-
day night I dropped in-
to a Melb. church, and
heard the preacher slob-
bering at this late hour
over the pathos of Prin-

the sick bed of the
Duke of Clarence,
whose brother she married almost as soon as he was
cold.”

bogus charity of Christmas grub. Good people
fancy that three hundred and sixty-four days of

meal on one day.”

The case of undertaker Jones, who was
recently made a clergyman in Melbourne and thus
qualified to read the burial service over the firm’s
“ stiffs,” has raised a big commotion. In Victoria
any man can become a legally - recognised
parson if 40 persons sign a petition that they
want him appointed to attend to their spiritual
wants. Then he is entitled to marry people
(which doesn’t matter much so long as the knot
holds good), and to bury them (which doesn’t
matter at all as the deceased takes no interest in
the matter); also, the 40 casual signatures qualify
him to know all about Genesis, and the material
perdition, and Jonah, and St. John at Pat-
mos, and the mark of the Beast, and similar
mysteries. In fact, it seems that 40 people who
know nothing at all can, by signing a piece of
paper, fill a man who knows next to nothing with
a comprehensive knowledge of everything. Jones,
it is reported, has no tabernacle and no congrega-
tion, and some of the people who signed his bit of
paper had the haziest idea what it was about, and
the address of the alleged kirk seems to be a piece
of waste ground infested with kerosene-tins and
dogs, and Jones calls himself the Reformed Church
of England—which is regarded as a very large
order indeed. Genuine reverends with the name
blown in the bottle rather appear to regard Jones
and his kind as a burlesque and a carnal grab-
bing at the fees and perquisites. But then the
average parson is also a good deal of a burlesque,
and his monkey-shave makes it practically im-
possible to take him seriously.

The bones of the original Superfluous
Woman were lately found near Plimmerton
(M.L.). She was lying in the bush in company
with a male person, also deceased. Each had the
perforation of a bullet in the skull, so the case is
set down as a romantic suicide. Along with the
remains were two revolvers, a bottle, and a purse
containing £7 and a memo., which set forth that
the money was for burial expenses ; also the male
skeleton was accompanied by a travelling bag
containing a Wellington Times dated October,
’94. Some people set down the tragedy to the
dreariness of the leading article, but this is mere
conjecture. No one knows anything of two people
haying gone amissing about that period, therefore
it is assumed that the lady was the real Super-
fluous Woman, and being superfluous her absence
wasn’t noticed. The police report says that
the pair had been “considerably disturbed by
cattle,” so their troubled career seemingly con-
tinued to be troubled even after death. * They
were worried in their lives, and harassed by cows
when they were dead, and there was no rest any-
where.

There is no offence under the Master and Servants’
Act which renders a servant liable to imprisonment, and
the master to fine only. But it is an offence punishable
by fine, and, in default of sufficient distress, by im-
prisonment, if a servant, who contracts to serve, does
not enter on the service according to his agreement, yet
no provision is made for the master who breaks his con-
tract. In such a case the servant would have only
a civil action for damages for the breach —the master
isn’t even liable to fine. A servant is also liable to fine
or imprisonment for absenting himself without leave—a
master cannot commit the offence.


A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Sydney, Jan. 5, 1897.
Mr Dear Myee—
The high and mighty residents of Bowral and
Moss Vale have been celebrating the holy Xmas
season by having a little “ Mountain Misery on
their own account in the matter of balls. Ihe
jealousy existing between Caesar and Pompey, or
between Melb. and Sydney, is as nothing to the
wild envy that surges up between the Nicest of
the two adjacent villages. So when the Moss
Vale Tennis Club gave its annual ball on New
Year’s eve the expected Bowralites refused to be
dazzled by the glare and electric-lights in Ben-
nett’s Hall, and stayed away in large crowds from
the festivity, which was graced only by local
celebrities and some Sydney visitors. Govt. House
was also absent, having the Freeman Thomases
and other guests to entertain at Sutton Forest.
Next night the Bowral dance happened, and the
offended dwellers in the Vale retaliated by not
appearing thereat, but as liberal contingents
arrived from Mittagong and the regions lying
round about Burradoo and Bong Bong, there
would have been hardly room on the floor for
another set of ten light fantastic toes.
Moss Vale dance was brightened by a plump
and , pleasing matron from town who, attired in
the latest ball-room notion —embroidered net,
white on black—worked through a long programme
with the ardour of just-out 18 ; also a tall, local
youth, with an English manner attached, whose
collar was so lofty that it made him look as if he d
come out without his head. The hon. sec. waltzed
gracefully in white ducks.
Bowral decorated its School of Arts for the
festive occasion—every country town possesses one
of these useful institutions, so named because it
isn’t a school and there are no arts about it except
those of the ball-room angel—and entered into the
spirit of the thing by tying tennis-rackets, nets,
and balls on the walls, and hiring a mild young
man from a far distance to thump the piano loudly
enough to be heard above the riotous romping of
kitchen lancers. A tall married goddess in white
satin looked about as nice as anybody there,
though the hon. sec. and her many sisters and
cousins kept up with the beauty procesh most
successfully. A charmer from Windsor wore white
adorned with poppies.
The girls were a marked feature of both these
social convulsions ; their looks were quite up to
the average, and their incomes much beyond thau
mark. The whole region ought to be a happy
hunting-ground for the ambitious society man, as
the loud warbling of the oof-bird can be heard on
all sides, and local belles are divided into three
classes well-off, rich, and bloatedly - affluent.
With these inducements it is not to be wondered
at that the dances in this favored district are like
the new style of drama where all the action
happens “off,” and towards the end of the even-
ing or beginning of next morn resolve themselves
into sitting-out contests. Meanwhile a wondering
and sleepy musician gazes at three or four revolv-
ing coupies in a deserted room ; the chaperons
slumber around the walls, and there is “standing-
room ” only abound the §eats in the adiacent
grounds. <
Another theatrical row is darkening the atmos-
phere. This time it is two variety artists, who are
not playing in each other’s yard. R. G. Knowles
claims that dreary gag, “ I’ve got another hat,” as
his own and as used by him on a London audience
for many nights with surprising effect, and, now
that Crackles is trying the patience of Her
Majesty’s patrons with it every evening, the
original author is cut out of his rights. It’s an ill
wind that blows nobody any good, however, and,
now that it has become stale at the panto., the
original owner will not be able to spring it on a
long-suffering audience on the other side of Pitt-st.
At the Palace on Saturday evening H. Lee burst
forth in the gorgeous trappings of that other
lightning-change artist with a European reputa-
tion, Willie Hohenzollern. The audience was
high-toned and gave a London touch to the Pitt-
st. hall of Oriental splendor by being as fashion-
able in the stalls as up topside in the circle. All
the garments worn by Lee in his various imper-
sonations are most accurate, and alleged to be
copied, at vast expense, from waist measurements
and collar patterns supplied him by his “ great
men’s” tailors—barring the doublet-and-hose
artist of the Immortal Bard’s, whose tailor s pat-
tern-book shows measurements which can’t be dis-
entangled satisfactorily by experts from Bacon’s,
so William’s figure is treated as per tombstone
ideals.
To help Lee effect his numerous changes, five
men are stationed behind the scenes, and rushing
at Henry simultaneously, when he comes off the
stage, one grabs the artist’s wig while another
tears wildly at his waistcoat ; a third menial
violently removes his boots, and two stand by
with fresh garments which are hurled on him in
hot haste, so that when the wild, weird music
ceases to interlude and the curtain rises, the poor
man is quite breathless, but disguises the fact
from the audience by speaking slowly. If the
“ change ” could be done in view of the front of
the house, the turn would go with more rush and
bustle and less sepulchral solemnity. It is im-
mensely clever, but wants brightening badly. Kip.
takes best of all, because he is done in a lighter
vein, and also because he is the only one in the
collection who has a local interest—having once
spent two whole days in Australia.
Again, encore, once more, yet another time is
the same old discussion raised whether or not a
young woman should help to swell the family
income by earning some coin on her own account,
or sit at home darning her father’s socks and sew-
ing on his buttons until an eligible man happens
along and Pa hands her over to him with a sigh
of relief at having got another girl off his hands.
The present aspect of the discussion is fashioned
by the new regulation of the Civil Service Board,
which is about to admit a flood of feminine short-
hand writers and typists into the Govt, service.
A daily paper correspondent throws rather a new
side-light on domestic matters by asserting that
the Australian father, as a rule, jibs at supporting
his grown-up daughters, and if one of them asks
him to foot her dressmaker’s last little l,;n
in the habit of remarking that that way madness
lies, or how sharper than a toothless tank it is
to have a serpent’s child, or words to that effect,
and slamming the front door loudly on himself as
he rushes out into the wide world away from the
filial demand for cash. This is practically the
case unless the old man is a millionaire, and the
only remedy I can suggest is that every g‘ri
ought to cake great care to be born into a
family wherein she can have a good time all her
single life at somebody else’s expense.
“ The Alabama (U.S.) Legislature is preparing
a bill prohibiting women from wearing bloomers,
shirt-waists, or any article of man s apparel.
News Item. In view of the possibility that ttus
kind of legislation may spread to Australia I have
prepared the following piece of verse :
Two Parramatta “first families” were more
closely united by matrimonial bonds last week,
when Miss Esther Weston, daughter of the late
F. Weston, was legally tied to a son of the late
Charles S. Oakes, by Rev. Gunther, at St. John’s.
Other unions during the week, which was a busy
one hymeneally, were Miss Nellie Selfe and Mr.
Jack Williamson, at Neutral Bay—-an affair with
any amount of thrills and frills in the way of
decorations and garments ; and Miss Ethel Lloyd
and Mr. Leslie Wade, of Ashfield, at Parramatta.
The time is ripe to suppress with a remorseless
hand the regulation wedding-report. “ An ex-
tremely pretty wedding” is always celebrated;
the church is always decorated by “ girl friends of
the bride ; ” the bride always enters “ the sacred
edifice upon the arm of her father by whom she
was subsequently given away.” If the church
were decorated by the “ contracting parties,” or
the father were to enter upon the corn of one of
the “ girl friends,” or if the best man were to be
supported by the bride, it would be an exciting
variation upon the hackneyed story. Then the
“ profusion of flowers and ferns ” erected by the
“girl friends ” might be allowed for once to wobble
tipsily (these vegetables always do) from pew
ends, and tickle the spectators’ necks and heads
as they wilted in the stuffy interior. Further, it
would be a refreshing change if a very ordinary
wedding would happen once in a while ; and what
is the matter with having the church decorated
occasionally by some middle-aged ladies who are
with great difficulty smothering their animosity
for the bride, instead of the regulation “ girl
friends.”
A wedding-gift boom is sometimes enthusiasti-
cally worked up around an impending marriage,
as in the case of a damsel from the backblocks
who came to a rich relation’s in Sydney to have a
send-off worthy of a niece of Nice families. The
energetic aunt issued invitations, and spread such
highly-varnished reports of the gilded saloons in
which the dear bride’s intended habitually moved
that the wedding-guests went without butter for
a week rather than give a shabby donation to
stand out conspicuously among costly offerings on
the wedding-morn. So the happy couple raked in
a whole stock-in-trade of platedware, and, among
other superfluities, a visitors’ book in red morocco,
to lie in the hall attached to the gilded saloon.
And the same turned out to be, in reality, a plain,
unvarnished bark hut. There was no castellated
pile, or ancestral hall with hollow echoes in the
vast corridors ; in fact, the much-boomed bride-
groom was but a boundary-rider on the station
alleged to belong to him, and the red morocco
tome came in useful to prop up the damaged end
of a colonial sofa.
The newly-married Mrs. Scot Inglis has a taste
for curious pets. Her favorites are two snakes.
One is a very small and affable wriggler, who can
be carried about comfortably in a glove, and who
goes to sleep curled up on the lady’s palm. The
other is a robust streak of wrath, 9ft. Bin. long,
and said by connoisseurs to be two centuries old|
or thereabouts. The long snake is not wholly
affable ; when he is disturbed in his box he uses
language of the Louis XIY. period, and he has a
powerful grip when he can get the necessary
leverage.
Anguished hospital inmates have quite lately
had their pains intensified by an organisation
banded together to amuse the sufferers with song
and recitation. A nicely-worded prospectus
handed round to the charitable shows a graduated
scale of hilarity adapted to various degrees of grief
and pain. They sort out their mirth -raisers
systematically, so as “ neither to depress by undue
pathos, nor bring the sense of violent contrast to
bear too strongly, by unseemly jesting.” For
instance, it wouldn’t be wise to chant “ Bally-
hooley” in the dipsomaniac ward, and “The
Raven would probably be a depressing reeita-
tj°n m a room full of hysteria patients. But in
the casualty ward the day after St. Patrick’s, it
would be an interesting experiment to plav
Boyne Wa-ter ’ softly to see how the cases
would stand it. Prince Alfred hospital was the
first scene of operations by the new society, and
the entertainment was submitted to by the
inmates with Christian fortitude.
A well-known Sydney man got into difficult’' !
during the recent happy-new-year outburst with
an enraged dog, which turned again and rent the
man so severely that he went to a doctor to tret
his wound dressed. The doctor advised the exe-
cution of the offending animal, and it was accord-
ingly slaughtered, and then somebody informed
the medical luminary that “ the dog which had
bitten Mr. Blank had died of d.t.’s.” The doctor

A ball was recently held at Bowen (Q.) which

With an outside temperature of anything

An up-country parson was anxious to get up a
little wind-raising flutter with the usual ch " r ? l ?'
repairs or inanse-buildmg m view. Coe ot h
flock, a lively girl, who had learned skirt-dancing
and other vanities, undertook to whoop up some-
thing entirely novel if he would give her
carte blanche, assuring the doubtful cleric, with
a confident gleam in her star-like eyes that
“ variety ” biz. is the only thing that pays
nowadays. Permission was granted, and the sub-
sequent show was a «ild and rapturous success,
consisting of alleged comic songs, step and buck
dances, and other exciting turns. At the end
thereof, the benefiting and ungrateful cleric arose
to pronounce the benediction, and placed his
official ban on the proceedings, assuring the
assemblage of his entire disapproval of that style
of entertainment, which he only submitted to in
order to scoop in the coin. He would take the
cash, but not the responsibility of the worldly per-
formance.
My Melb. correspondent writes: —
“A young lady who has done a good deal of
decent work in prose and verse, and whose signa-
ture has appeared at the foot of many respectable
wattle poems, is now going to ‘ give it best. Ihe
province of art and poetry which she has hung
around so long yields no remunerative return for
her life-long devotion, and she proposes to become
a waitress in a tea-room, or something equally
sordid, for a livelihood. No one can live in Aus-
tralia by dwelling in aculchawed fashion on the
outskirts of literature. In England such a person
as the historic ‘ Janus Weathercock ’ —the feathery
litterateur who murdered his sister-in-law ‘be-
cause her ankles were so thick,’ and became
known as Wainwright, the convict —could live by
writing pages of airy nothings about the glitter of
the bead on the sherry and other dreamy things
of the kind ; but here the person who merely
frivols nicely in the domain of letters makes
nothing by it.
“ Miss Ethel Levien, the pretty daughter of the
lon. Felix Levien (Melbourne), is to be married
some time in ’97 to an English Johnnie —a nephew
of Lord Russell.
“Professor Marshall Hall is regarded in Mel-
bourne society as an enfant terrible. For brusquerie
and unconventionality of manner he stands alone,
and only Minister Peacock and the laughing
jackass can do anything to approach his shriek of
merriment when he is in a festive humor. In
society at which Peacock draws the line, Marshall
Hall’s wild guffaw is unequalled.
“ Charles Magrath, who knocked the Australian
girls considerably when he came along with the
Belle-Cole Co., is now playing the name-part in
the Irish opera, ‘ Shamus O Brien.’ He is around
the Great Britain neighborhood. Magrath, by
the way, was presented by a love-sick Brisbane
girl with a swell emerald ring ; but he is a very-
much-married man, like Douglas Powell and most
other warbling pros, of whom damsels dream.
“ Florence Young’s marriage with the new-
chum admirer is now said to be all off, and the
lively Hebraic prima-donna’s engagement to an
Auckland doctor is in much the same condition,
owing to family objections.
“ A par. lately published in a Melb. sassiety
journal re the approaching nuptials of a go-ahead
Melb. girl with a well-gilded son of Erin, roused
the ire of the bride elect. She visited the editor
in his dingy sanctum, and stated her opinion of
him and his paper in language which was frequent
and free, not to say tremendous. “ Filthy rag ”is
about the mildest epithet she now applies to the
once beloved chronicle of small beer, and the
damsel’s denunciations of the scandalous person
who gave away particular - which she would rather
have kept quiet prove very entertaining to her
dearest friends.—Yours affectionately, Cleo.
This last decree of truant man
Has plunged my soul in woe ;
For garments fashioned on the plan
Of manly togs must go.
I mustn’t wear his sailor-hat,
His collars or his studs ;
I don’t know what he would be at
In docking thus my duds.
The law won’t sanction rubber shoes,
So tennis now is gone ;
My bike is rusting out of use,
I can’t put bloomers on.
I can’t sans pants, on horseback rub,
Nor golf without a “Tam,”
From every sport debarred I’ll hide,
And murmur softly “ bother it! ”
My waist I’ll duly now begin
To clothe with legal tact,
For belts and arms both come within
The meaning of the Act.
I’d gladly ransack Eden’s code
To find a fashion new
Of wearing fig-leaves it la mode,
But Man has been there, too !

Dear Sir, —I have suffered from Indigestion, Dys-

the last five years, and have tried several so-called
cures without getting relief. I have also been under
the treatment of six doctors, but without effect. See-
ing your advertisement of Wahoo in the papers, I
thought I would try it, and, though not expecting it
would do me any good considering my age (63 years),

taken a few doses when I got relief, and now feel in
better health than I have formanvyears.—Yours truly,

F • “ How truly Wordsworth said. • Scorn not
th . ’ The cricket was in danger of being scorned
f>n the first day of S.A. v. Vic., when Bruce and Graham
were*slain by Jones, when two wickets fell for 0 and three
for 4 There was nothing to watch save the venomous
bowline of Jones. H. Trott provided an interval-but
42 runs merely reduced the state of the score from
disastrous to calamitous. As for Harry, the veteran,
funk did the business for him, and Jones assisted funk by
cannonballing Harry: first in the waist, second in the
W Trumble also appeared for a brief season in sore
distress, and people will call him henceforth Tremble.
People knew the Victorians could never make 150 ; they
reckoned the innings would finish about 3.45 p.m.
There would be an interval, and Lyons would then
take the bat. But suddenly the innings found its
saviour in the almost unknown O’Halloran. With
iov it was observed that he scored his double
figures with grace and confidence. He reached Trott’s
score of 42, and passed it. The last man in was Johns,
one of the passengers of the late Australian eleven.
Everybody knows that Johns can’t bat. That is probably
why he put up a good score bv good play. Meantime
O'Halloran was well up in the nineties—and the total score
was almost 300. Next the new great man passed his
century, and severely hit George Giffen for 5. At six
o’clock the score, which was desolate, had got well on the
sunny side of 300, with one wicket still to fall. And there
was a popular rumor abroad that O’Halloran was the
greatest batsman in the world.
Harry Musgrove’s report to the A.C.C. intro-
duces the old fiction that Australian Elevens are over-
worked “It seems to me, too, that to play cricket for
six davs a week for 17 weeks is too much for the strongest,
and there must come a period of staleness sooner or later,
which three days’ holiday now and again would avert.”
Thus manager Musgrove. The Bulletin is tired of quot-
ing figures to prove that the Australian bitsmen and
bowlers make fewer runs and take fewer wickets during a
season than the leading English ditto. Why this eternal
assumption that Our Boys must necessarily get stale?
They don’t play six days a week for 17 weeks—not if they
do their duty bv polishing off the second-rate county
teams in two days. Then there is the occasional day’s
rest “in consequence of rain.” Furthermore, an Aus-
tralian Eleven numbers 14 players, and each man in the
crowd could get three days’ rest (exclusive of Sundays)
every second week if his health required it.

man’s “ sturdy defence ” with admiring interest. Donnan
seems to be voted, on all hands, a dreary bore.

There was a strong muster of blackguardism in
the half-crown reserve at the M.B.C. New Year’s meeting,
Judging from appearances, the “push” of foul-mouthed
expectorators gathered in the neighborhood of the dress-
ing-room had not paid two arid-sixpence to get there.
They were deadheads—bike-riders, trainers, and hangers-
on. If the sport is to remain prosperous these alarming
items must be shut off as much as possible from unini-
tiated spectators. A very slight acquaintance with “the
scum of the track” is sufficient to take away one’s appe-
tite for bicycle-racing, which already seems doomed to go
the way of’professional pedestrianism and other played-
out games whose bullet-headed professors brought them
into contempt.
* * * *
Half-a-dozen riders at the M.B.C. summer
meeting at St. Kilda on Jan. 1 and 2 did more to kill cycle-
racing in Australia than anything that has yet happened,
only excepting the pusillanimity of the stewards who
bossed the show. On the first day there were a score of
instances of cronk running, perfectly obvious to every-
body who knew anything about the game, and quite as
glaring as the average work by which a jockey earns dis-
qualification on the worst-conducted pony-course in the
province. Yet the officials did nothing vehemently, and
apparently it was only the bustling they got from the
Saturday’s morning papers that impelled them to fine
Martin and Kellow £5 apiece the second day.
Kellow started in a mile heat with M'Donell,
his only opponent, and led until 100yds. from home. The
“ Unpaced King ” then came past at about a two-minute-
to-a-mile bat and the Austral winner let him go, pursuing
the even tenor of his way at the same old pace. Kellow
didn’t seem to try, but why he didn’t is not apparent.
Bilmartin’s lapse was similar, but different.
Bill started a hot favorite in a heat where he was pitted
against Middleton, J. Carpenter, and Boidi—a fact not to
be wondered at, for the race looked all his own. When
the sprint came—what there was of it—Middleton lashed
out at a terrific pace, something like that of a traracar,
and won by 20 lengths. Bill says he could not get out of
a pocket to respond to Middleton's spurt, but two men
can’t form much of a pocket anyhow, and some people
think it would take 25 to block the iron-jawed plugger if
he wanted to get out. Bill’s further excuse was that he had
been suffering from dysentery and had not recovered—in
proof of which he put in two startling sprints later in the
day, getting second to Porta by a wheel in the Brassey
Stakes and winning the 10-Mile Scratch. However, the
committee reckoned that neither of the explanations was
satisfactory, and, after an hour and a half’s deliberation,
decided to —well, fine each of the offenders £5.
The officials who decided the business were in a
difficulty. Bilmartin was more energetic than all of them
put together, and if they had made it worth his while to
serve out stoush freely, he was muscular enough to kill
the whole committee. Also, they had a proportion of
League men among them, and the League doesn’t want
to spoil the prospective Lewis-Martin match, which is esti-
mated to return that bod 3' many shekels. On the other
hand, the crowd looked as if it thought something
should be done, and the crowd, which provides the
shekels, must be considered.
* * * •
Another man was dealt with by the stewards
during the afternoon, but as he was not one of the top-
notchers, his case did not require so much “ earnest con-
sideration.” He was brought before the august body as
soon as he got off his machine, and when he heard the
complaint he degenerated into “blanky” language and
was promptly sent up for six months, the whole affair
being accomplished in 2min. 55 l-ssec.

Superintendent Sadlier, of the Victorian

the last of that dignified order, promotion in the
police-force now being from the ranks.
Sedgwick Cowper, an Australian native
who should have made his mark, died last week
in Sydney Hospital from lung disease. He was
the youngest son of the late Archdeacon Cowper,
•one of the early chaplains in the “System,” by
his third wife, and was brother to ex-Premier
Charles Cowper and Dean Cowper, also uncle to
the Sydney ex-sheriff.
One of the most charming works of the
late poet, William Morris, is a scented romance
entitled “ The Wood beyond the World,” which,
in Sydney Public Library, is catalogued as
“Morris, W. : Wood beyond the World, The.”
The book is hardly read, most people thinking it
a scientific work upon the existence of timber in
other planets. This is fame.
Q. “Mines and Railways” Pliilp, some
time ago, severed his actual connection with the
shipping firm of Burns, Philp, and Co., Ltd. The
jibe still appearing in Q. newspapers that he
gets £lOOO a year from the co. and £lOOO a year as
Cabinet Minister is, therefore, unwarranted. Philp
may be a smart and energetic business man, but
he is a lame and unobtrusive legislator and a no-
account orator.
Ex-Justice Windeyer’s hopes of a seat on
the judicial committee of the Privy Council have
been shattered. The Imperial Act required that

Sydney Maxted, grand boss of N.S.W.
charities, was, 30 years ago, editor of the Cumber-
land Mercury. Other ex-editors who are doing
well in notable billets are Conciliation Board
Clegg, now registering a number of abstract facts
which someone some time may like to know about,
and whisky’s valiant friend, the rotund Bevill.
Clegg edited the old Sydney Echo, and Bevill
once conducted the “we” department of a sheet

“I saw Duncan Gillies at a smoke night
of St. George’s Club,” writes a London corres-
pondent. “The resigning Agent-General looked
anything but resigned, and I doubt whether he
could be fitter or stronger or in better trim for
making the weary Turner sit up. He is anxious
to return and once more take the place now kept
tepid for him by the MTntyre. There will be a
fluttering in the dovecote at the top of Bourke-
street when Duncan’s stony, impassive stare once
more falls on the inmates.”
The patriotic editor of a paper in a
northern town, lately connected by rail, point
blank declined to insert an advt. from N.S.W.

the life-blood from the town that shelters me.”
An old Sydney identity died last week in
the person of Mrs. B. C. Rodd, of Barnstaple
Manor, Five Dock. The deceased lady was a
sister of “ Old Jack ” Robertson, and her husband,
Mr. Rodd, is the oldest attorney on the Australian
rolls, having been admitted to practise as far back
as 1834, during the Governorship of Richard
Bourke.
A certain Fat Kee, of Brisbane, was re-
cently haled before the beak and charged with
selling a shilling’s worth of opium in contraven-
tion of Section 9 of the Sale of Drugs and Poisons
Act. It transpired, in the course of evidence,
that Fat Kee paid the revenue no less than =£looo
per annum imported duty on opium. God bless
our leper.
A GENTLE HINT.
“Yes I but what on earth made you buy a tandem? ”
“Oh, I didn’t. It teas a present from the ewe lambs of my congregation.”
Professor Baldwin Spencer, of Melbourne
University, and F. J. Gillen (brother of the late
S.A. Lands Minister Gillen) are at Alice Springs
(8. A.), engaged in writing a monumental work on
the natives of Central Australia. Gillen has lived
for a-quarter of a century or more among the
people about whom he is writing, and probably
knows them as well as any man living. The
Australian aboriginal is fast becoming an extinct
subject, and is also rapidly rubbing off his most
distinctive characteristics by much friction against
the white man’s public-houses ; therefore, if Gillen
puts all he knows into his book, its value some
years hence should be enormous.
THE EFFICACY OF PRAYER.
This is the picture of a hop-beer vendor (locally known as a
“shy poo”) at Cue, W.A., who recently made a large stock of beer
in the expectation that the weather was going to be darned hot. It
immediately became darned cool, and the shypoo thereupon took the law
into his own hands, and prayed for a blast from Gehenna, as shown in the
picture . But Gehenna was “off.”
Premier Turner, of Victoria, is the only
Australian knight announced among the New
Year degradations. Turner is one of the few
Australian politicians who can take a knighthood
without incurring political disaster. He never
said that he was a republican or a democrat or
that he wanted to pull down the Throne ; also he
never professed to have any veneration for that
gilded institution. He was never suspected of
asking for a title, and he never said he wouldn’t
take one if it came. In all his speeches Turner is
hardly known to have made one allusion to the
Crown or the British Flag or the H’empire ; he
let ail these things drift as matters in which
he took no interest. And, if his past record
goes for anything, Turner, K.C.M.G., in his old
suit will defend the everyday horse-thief just as
before, and the shabby little man will probably
lose his gewgaw, or w r ear it askew, or drop it
absent-mindedly on the floor and stand on it, and
hereby, The Bulletin trusts, bring it into even
more obloquy than it has hitherto attained.
J. F. Thallon, till now general traffic-
manager of Q. railways, has been appointed
deputy-railway commissioner, which means that
he will be “Bob” Gray’s substitute when the
latter’s liver is bad. Thallon has been 16 years
in the Q. railway service. “ Bob ” Gray, who was a
brother-in-law of the late Joshua Peter Bell, seems,
to old Bananalanders, to have been always in the
public service, in some comer or the other.
Mr. Ernest Hoo-
ley, who has made
millions by exploiting
the Dunlop tyre and
a certain extract of
beef, and who has
since bought several
huge estates in vari-
ous English counties,
is now violently reach-
ing out for a dukedom,
or a C.M.G.-ship, or
something ; he has, it
is cabled, presented
St. Paul’s Cathedral
with a gold com-
munion service, said
to be the most costly
extant, as a thanks-
offering in connection
with Queen Victoria’s
record reign. Hooley
is a man of compre-
hensive sweep: in one
act he thus posts his
little advt. on the
Great White Throne
and on the front door
of Windsor Castle.
But he is quite right
in steering clear of
half - measures and
going !he whole hog,
for anyone working
towards ennobblement
under such a name as
Hooley the cogno-
men, it will be remem-
bered, of the vulgar,
red - headed boss in
“ The Shop Girl ”
labors under serious
disadvantages. How-
ever, just as the Mul-
lenses evolved into the
De Moleynses, so
Hooley may hereafter
be heard of among the
Very Nicest People as
D’Oyley —he would
never think of calling
himself D’Hooley.
Drury, of the Q.N. Bank, died reputedly
worth over ,£70,000. Unless his assets were of
the same character as those of the scented institu-
tion which he managed, Drury evidently did a lot
better for himself than for his depositors.
How Governors save money. A Melb.
chemist shows in his window a small free-franked
envelope, “On Her Majesty’s Service.” He
proudly adds that it contained a request from the

Foster, Vic. Minister for Mines, was a
Gippsland storekeeper in bygone years. Quite
recently, when Foster in all his glory was touring
Gippsland with some other Ministers, one of his
old customers suddenly recognised him, and there
and then paid him 7s. 6d. off an old account for
flour and tinned fish.
Gov. Hampden does not part with his coin
in response to private appeals for charity as easily
as did his predecessors, Jersey and Carrington,
A derelict musician who “ lives on the game ”
recently wrote a pathetic begging-letter to His
Ex. asking for relief m his necessities. His Ex.
wrote from Moss Vale that he would communicate
with the applicant m a few days, and the derelict
concluded that his little spec, would pan out at
least a tenner. But it only panned out for a
lithographed circular which was partly “ haw ”
and partly an intimation that the applicant had
better try the Charity Organisation Society.
Ex-Governor Loch was engaged to preside
over Duncan Gillies’ farewell dinner at St. George’*
Club this week. This should be an affecting cere-
mony. Loch, the boom Governor of Victoria,
proposing the health of the shiny little fat man
who ran the boom Government, and predicting
(loud cheers) that the return of Gillies to the scene
of their former greatness would inaugurate an-
other era of prosperity, &c., &e.
“THE BULLETIN'S ” NEW YEAR CARD.
Vic. Judge Hodges’ luck has been bad of
late. He had three children very ill with diph-
theria, and his wife was also on the sick-list
through overwork and anxiety. Then Hodges
started for the scene of his judicial duties on his
bicycle, and another bikist ran him down, the re-
sult, so far as Hodges was concerned, being a
broken leg and a dislocated ankle. He was
brought home, and that evening the family cook
also laid up with diphtheria.
The most intimate friend of a well-known
Australian politician sums .him up thus: “He
can’t help lying ; it’s constitutional, like gout or
insanity or kleptomania. He doesn’t lie for any
purpose, but merely because he can’t help it. A
thing may be true although he says it is, but the
chances are always against it. His accuracy lies
in the fact that you can generally rely on things
being what he says they are not, but of late he
has told the truth once or twice, and this is
making people lose confidence in him.”
A Cairns (Q.) Asiatic sugar-planter and
capitalist was recently arrested by the police in
connection with a cane-burning case, and dis-
charged “without a stain on his character.” Now
this cultured, gentlemanly Aryan was carted about
chained to sundry Kanakas, and there is the very
devil to pay. The Asiatic gent, is naturally indig-
nant at being manacled to savages and cannibals.
And the Kanakas who despise Asiatics are natur-
ally also wrathful. The distinctions of class and
color in Bananaland are truly wonderful.
Vague reports of Thomas MTlwraith’s
further relapse come in by cable. If M ‘llwraith
is well-advised he will continue to relapse till the
Q.N. Bank trouble is definitely over. The Nelson
Government may have all the goodwill in the
world to smother the ghost of that wonderful in-
stitution, but the balance of power lies with the
British depositors, and the spectre may rise in all
manner of unexpected places. The wisest thing
would be for everybody concerned to fall ill and
remain unconscious for 12 months at least.
Ex-Argus leader-writer James Smith
claims to have made a wonderful discovery (which
he will publish) that will further settle the settled
question as to who wrote the letters of “ Junius.”
“ Junius,” however, is rather out of date —if the
eminent journalist could but settle the question as
to who wrote certain anonymous letters to Mrs.
Aubrey Bowen (Money Miller’s daughter and
banker Edward Miller’s sister) in reference to
alleged obligations acknowledged by the spirit of
her deceased husband, he would clear up a matter
of much more interest to Melbournians.
Powell, the retrenched boss of the Sydney
Custom House, is probably well-advised in not
moving for an increase of his pension. His pen-
sion—or gratuity, if he likes it that way—is valued
at about £2OO per annum. His merchant friends
have handed him £l2l in a purse. He has been
appointed member of the Board of Customs at
£lOO a year, and member of the Health Board at
another £lOO a year. Mr. Powell may deserve
the billets which have rained on him, but even
though he didn’t deserve them a man with his
numerous political friends would probably get
them all the same.

A STATUE OF GOV. PHILLIP HAS BEEN EXECUTED FOB THE DOMAIN.


POLITICAL POINTS
Brisbane Telegraph brags that “ Queens-
land is likely to be the tail that will wag the Aus-
tralian-federation dog.”
There are now 1700 Justices of the Peace
in S. A. out of 87,000 males over the age of 20 years,
or an average of one J.P. to every 50 adult males.
Lands-Minister O’Loughlin is the only
member of the S.A. Cabinet who does not seek
election to the Federal Convention. Someone has
to remain behind while the rest of the Govern-
ment is away constitution-making.
It is reckoned that the Maoriland Govern-
ment was backed up 197,000 votes at the late
election, while the Opposition numbered 155,000
supporters. If so, the figures are getting peri-
lously close, and Seddon may have to hustle all he
knows in ’99.
Two Q. Labor-members, Jackson and
M‘l)onnell, crossed over the floor of the House,
and supported an adjournment of the debate on
the second reading of the utterly-idiotic Anti-
Gambling Bill (afterwards shelved). Carried by
23 to 21. Had these two not so voted, the Bill
would have been rejected right there.
Chief-Justice Madden’s appointment as
Acting-Gov. of Victoria, during the five-weeks’
holiday in Maoriland of Gov. Brassey, recalls the
complications which arose in N.S.W. some years
ago, when Gov. Hercules Robinson went to annex
Fiji. He was to be absent six weeks, and Chief-
Justice Martin demanded to be sworn in as
Acting-Gov. Parkes refused, saying that the
province could govern itself for that short time.
Martin and wife kicked up a row, and Robinson’s
wife vowed she would leave Govt. House if
any of the Martin “ faction ” came there.
Result: Hercules K. “explained” matters to the
Home authorities ; not in a very generous manner,
giving the pedigree of the Martins and other
habitues of Govt. House, and the row ended in old
Alfred Stephen being appointed Lieut.-Governor
for life
Even Brisbane
Courier is satisfied
that Nelson is going
to clear out of politics
at the first decent op-
portunity. First he
meant to quit after the
elections ; then he was
persuaded to see the
Q.N. Bank stench dis-
infected ; and still his
party, frightened of
riots and dissension in
the Cabinet, is loth to
let him go. Nelson had
a fair reputation when
he started politics, but
he has damaged it con-
siderably by thick-and-
thin party prostitution.
Even now, however,
he’s held about the
cleanest man on his
side. It’s a great poli-
tical help to be the son
of a parson especially
a Presbyterian parson.
One quaint feature
about the Queensland
increase of newspaper
postage is that Queens-
land itself derives no
profit whatever from
the additional rate le-
vied. No outside news-
papers are to be ad-
mitted into Queens-
land after Ist January
unless they bear the
increased postage-rates
and thereby contribute
so much more to the
postal revenue of the
provinces from which
they came. Queensland,
however, doesn’t insist
on any increased post-
age on its newspapers
sent to other provinces,
therefore it gains no-
thing by its own move,
except the satisfaction
of trying to shut out
some publications
which have spoken dis-
respectfully of its fa-
mous bank. And, as
its own organs are now
speaking about as
badly concerning its famous bank as outside ones
could do, this satisfaction amounts to very little.
Even the S.M. Herald now prints M.P.
after Leg. Assembly names and M.L.C. after
those of members of the Council. John Haynes
was the first really persistent M.P. in New South
Wales.
A Melbourne paper, which professes to be
in the confidence of the National Ass, says that
money is already being raised to defray the exes, of
certain special Ass candidates at next gen. election ;
also, that a much stronger man than Barrister
Coldham has been got ready to stand against
Premier Turner for St. Kilda. Coldham was over
200 votes behind Turner at last contest, and the
Premier has gained much additional popularity
since then.
Four of the brightest and most eminently
disappointing young politicians in Australia are
Drake, of Queensland ; B. R. Wise (there is such a
person, isn’t there?), of New South Wales; and
Deakin and Shiels, of Victoria. All four are
able, eloquent, with good powers of reasoning and
analysis—and all are failures of much the same
pattern. As Omar Pasha said of his prospective
successor Abdul-Kerim, they seem to be too
learned for victory.”
A section of Q. Labor-party has been
“ judiciously influenced ” to support Boodle wraith
and the Q.N. Bank. Exactly how the influence
was applied is a matter of conjecture. But an
astonishing exhibition of Labor in politics was
given the other day, when Leader Glassey and
others attended a peepshow of the St. Helena
political prisoners by special invitation from
Minister Tozer, and were afterwards fed and
wined by their host —the man who told the police
to “ fire effectively” on the unionists of the ’94
strike !
The author of the pregnant booklet,
“Made in Germany,” which has set British
manufacturers by the ears, sums his conclusions
as to how British trade can be regained or re-
tained. Conclusion No. 2
We must federate the Empire. They (the colonies)
must discriminate in their tariffs, and admit English pro-
ducts on more favorable terms than those of other
nations.
Astonishing how long it takes to kill the British
notion that “colonies ” are cows to be milked for
the benefit of Brummagem.
Kanaka Queensland is still illogically tout-
ing for white immigrants. Only the other day
another immigration-lecturer was appointed, in
the person of Rev. G. D. Buchanan, of Wickham
Terr. Presbyterian Church, a canny parson who
is blessed with much eloquence and a well-developed
love of the saxpence. Why a parson should be
sent on such an errand is difficult to understand.
No lecturer who tells the solid truth about the
land of debt and boodle and strange banks will
attract emigrants, and no parson can be reason-
ably expected to tell lies for mere sordid cash.
THE CHILD OF THE BUSH.
(In Martin Place, Sydney.)
LITTLE BILLEE (from the Big Scrub): “ There are some awful big huts
about here, father!"
Treasurer Holder (S.A.) has hopes that the
drought will not cause a loss of more than
.£lO,OOO to the revenue during the financial year
ending next June, and a surplus of about .£4OOO is
expected.
Premier Seddon is already laying his plans
for a commercial union between Maoriland and
the future Australian Commonwealth. Ex-
Treasurer Ward was strongly of opinion that
Maoriland should be a member of the Common-
wealth, and so was ex-Premier Atkinson,, but
Ballance held contrary views and believed in
standing aloof. If Maoriland does come into the
Federation, the lumping of all the debts together
will reduce its liability by £7 per head, and its
interest bill by 6s. per annum for each inhabitant.
If it stands out, and Seddon’s scheme of a com-
mercial league falls through, it will retain its big
debt all to itself and be practically shut out by
the Federal tariff from its best market. Either
way the adhesion of M.L. is tolerably certain
sooner or later.

tences, this time by magistrate Murr j,o or 14

THE MEDIUM POTATO.
MURPHY : “ The little taties be very small this year, Flynn.”
FLYNN : “I doan’t know ; some of 'em does be a very fair size."
When Yic. Parliament adjourned the
~ther day Melb. Paunch threw its usual vague
valedictory brick at the Ministry on the ground
that it ought to have “busied itself in trying to
mend the country’s prospects from the point of view
of the breadwinner.” Possibly the well-meaning
Turner would have done so if he had known how,
and probably Paunch would tell him how if it
knew itself—which apparently it doesn’t. Tory
journalism in Australia is very vague, and seldom
gets beyond the statement that “ measures should
be taken to restore confidence and promote the
development of the resources of this great
country,” or something like that.
One unfenced waterhole at Leichhardt
(Sydney) has been responsible for 13 drownings.
It is ori a piece of vacant land, the owner of which
is lost or dead—anyhow he has been unknown for
many years. No taxes are paid on this land. In
the present ridiculous state of the municipal law
there is no provision for prompt seizure and sale
to recover the unpaid rates. If the local authori-
ties fill in the hole they must do it at their own
expense, and if the owner ever does turn up he
may sue them for damage to the blessed property.
Wanted in N.S.W. a law similar to that now
existing in M.L, by which all unclaimed land
vests in the Public Trustee and is sold or leased
instead of remaining an eyesore for ever and ever.
Already there is a small outbreak of pro-
vincial jealousy as to which capital shall be the
scene of the Federal convention. Melb. demands
it on the ground that Sydney had the last
convention, and it is generally understood that
the demand will be conceded, on the understanding
that the second convention meeting, which is due
about four months after the first one, takes place
in Sydney. This tacit arrangement would be all
right, only Adelaide, which has had no convention
at all yet, juits in a very reasonable claim, so the
movement towards Unity may end in blood and
hair just when it seemed about to begin. The
presence of the convention is no special honor,
and no great profit beyond a trifling sum for
drinks, but these provinces are dreadfully solid on
the question of their dignity.
About the most unanimous curse ever
heaved at a Govt, department was that slung by
Vic. Assembly at Duffy’s Post Office management.
When the postal estimates came on for discussion
and gave the House a fair chance to let off its
long bottled-up opinion, it rose almost as one man—
Liberals, Conservatives and Labor-members alike —
and categorically denounced Duffy as a hopeless
incapable. It pointed out about 800 ways in
which the department was a bungle and a swindle
and a failure, and Duffy replied by cackling a few
inane jokes, and didn’t even attempt to seriously
answer any of his critics. If the Turner Ministry
hopes to live it will have to throw its P.M.G.
overboard very soon. Duffy is a flippant and
casual individual, who seems to regard his depart-
ment as a joke, or an Ally Sloper, or something
of the kind.
One proviso in the Federal Enabling Act
is that three provinces, “ including New South
Wales,” must be in the movement before anything
can be done. It is this which makes the obvious
lukewarmness of the N.S.W. Government especi-
ally ominous, for it holds the key of the position.
Tasmania, S.A., Victoria and Westralia would
make a respectable Federation to begin with, but
that would require a new Act, and before it could
be passed the movement which is now tepid would
probably be quite cold. The trouble is that
N.S.W., being the one essential province accord-
ing to the Act, is in a position to demand the
location of the Federal capital within her borders
or some other special concessions, failing which
she can burst up the whole business. The Federal
movement was supposed to “start fair” for all
parties, but somehow it didn’t.

In N.S.W. 1895
was the last year of
Protection Protec-
tion, that is, tem-
pered with the know-
ledge that Freetrade
was coming in the
very adjacent future.
According to Part
VII. of the N.S.W.
Statistics, just issued,
the number of hands
employed in the fac-
tories and workshops
increased in that year
by 1082, and this fact,
though not in itself
very definite proof,
tends to show that
things in l- v 95 were
moving slowly in the
right direction. The
thorough-going Pro-
tectionist opines that
this increase was the
natural improvement
caused by Protection,
and would have been
much greater only for
the baleful shadow of
approaching Free-
trade. The other man
is of opinion that it
was the natural im-
provement caused by
the near approach of
Freetrade, which in-
stilled hope and joy
into the manufac-
turer’s bosom, and
enabled him to bear
up against the hi >rn >rs
of Protection in the
immediate present.
And until the figures
for 1896 come along
a year hence the two
parties will probably
keep the wrangle go-
ing without anything
definite resulting.
Attorney-General Tommy Byrnes is be-
coming recognised as the most reactionary force in
Q. politics. It was only the other day that he
managed to cancel the Q. enactment against
deathbed legacies to churches and convents under
priestly influence, to the prejudice of widows and
orphans; and the priestly party trusts him
wholly. He is manoeuvring now to subsidise
R. schools at the expense of the State, and
overturn the Q. education system. In return for
his devotion to Mother Church, the clerical in-
fluence is continually strained in favor of the man
advertised as “ humbly prostrate at the feet ” of
Pope Leo.
Q. Police-Commissioner Parry-Okeden has
just done a tour through the North, following
closely on the recent footsteps of Archie Meston.
Meston came back from his inspection of the
autochthones with ghastly tales of blood, murder,
leprosy and other diseases, oppression, rum and
pessimism generally. Tired officialdom had either
to put things right or send someone to assert that
they weren’t wrong. Consequently, Okeden re-
turns, as everybody expected, with the glad tale
of how the Gulf aboriginal is a bright and sunny
nigger who leads an idyllic existence and is fondly
cared for by everybody. And peace supervenes
beautifully once more.
The Maoriland election made a consider-
able slaughter among the members of last Parlia-
ment. Sixty-five of them stood for re-election,
and of these 21 were left out in the cold. Five more
fled from the wrath to come, and didn’t face the
opprobrium and decayed egg of the infuriated
elector. Against this, 10 old politicians who went
under at previous elections and have since been
looking longingly at the honorarium from afar off
have got back again. Ten candidates, four of
them from Dunedin, forfeited their deposit of <£lo
each. No less than 12 candidates raged at the
poll in the windy southern city, and under these
conditions the four men at the bottom of the list
were so very low down that their postion was
hardly worth mentioning.
When the Maoriland provinces were to be
swept into the great maw of the Central Govern-
ment, they got nearly two years’ notice of the com-
ing event. It was provided among other things that
on the merging of the provinces the Central
Govt, took over any cash balances, all debts, and
all outstanding liabilities. J. D. Ormond, super-
intendent of Hawkes Bay (good, careful man),
actually handed over a cash balance. “ Jemmy ’
Macandrew, superintendent of Otago, being a
pawky, long-headed Scot, increased that province’s
liabilities by about .£lOO,OOO, let a large number
of contracts for public works which the Welling-
ton Govt, had to take over and finish and pay for,
and had nary cent in the provincial Treasury.
There should be a fine opportunity to work a
similar oracle when Australian Federation is a
little nearer.

Signs of the times. In Brunswick street,
Fitzroy, Melb., there is a fruit-shop which pro-
vides a concert on Saturday nights for the delecta-
tion of all customers who have bought sixpenn’orth
or upwards of fruit during the week. A little
lower down, in the same street, a bootmaker re-
hoofs the boots of the weary traveller for Is. 6d.
while he waits.
The tick is truly übiquitous. He has been
discovered on cattle, horses, sheep, native com-
panions, turkeys, Europeans, niggers, Chinamen,
Japs., snakes, hens, iguanas, lizards, and even on
the body of the common fly. He came mysteri-
ously and unaccountably, and from many inland
districts he is disappearing just as mysteriously as
he came.

“ SINBAD THE SAILOR,” AT TIER MAJESTY’S THEATRE, SYDNEY.


The Englishman, Relph, is evidently a boss
sprinter of the Zimmy type. Relph, at present,
looks much the same as the ’Murkan did 12 months
ago, and as Martin is at last beginning to look in his
turn. But the new man’s chance of improving between
now and Natives’ Day should be quite as good as Bil-
martin’s, all things considered.
Relph debuted magnificently in a series of
flashing sprints that place him in the first rank of
finishers. The first day he ran into third place in the
New Year Cup with a run in the last 100yds. the like of
which the St. Kilda track had never before seen. Relph
passed no less than nine men, and had the race been a
couple of yards longer it was his. On the Saturday he won
the Mile by inches from Walne, the men hanging head to
head for nearly half a lap. Porta is a very different man
from what he was last season. In the Five Miles he won
with three lengths to spare from Bilmartin, and badly up-
set that adamantine person’s apple-cart in the Brassey
Stakes. Bill had backed himself considerably for this
event but underrated the Italian’s powers and left his
sprint too late, with the result that he came in a foot be-
hind. Walne won the first-class handicap from 10 yards,
showed some fine but unsuccessful sprints, and did a
marvellous amount of fair, unselfish pacing over the
longer distances. Kuhle was another man who did a 10l
of good, honest riding without scoring a first.
* • • *
Porta’s brilliant finishes in the International
Scratch and the Brassey Stakes next day showed up the
excellence of Walne, who beat the Italian twice in heats
during the meeting. Walne’s well-sustained run of nearly
600 yards in the “ Lap” race, urith Porta vainly trying to
pass him all the time, was a remarkably game perform-
ance. The Queensland champion is seemingly the most
determined pacemaker of them all.
» * » *
The judging at the big Ballarat and Bendigo
cycle meetings on Xmas and Boxing days was even more
erratic than that of the Austral meeting. In one race
Martin ran an unmistakable second, yet he was placed
first, the third man being second, and the real winner
third. In another, the cunning push fell in heavily over the
judge’s error. It was arranged among those who had any
sort of a chance that the favorite was to go down while
a middle-mark man was to win. The money was on and
the race was splendidly executed, the crack just being
beaten by half-a-wheel after a magnificent struggle. But
when the numbers went up who should be pronounced
the winner but the disgusted favorite himself. There was
no getting away from the judge’s decision, and the youths
of much brain had to return to Melb. empty in pocket
and with a heap of kudos which their champion wasn’t
taking.
• * • *
Alex. Jewell, a Maryborough cyclist who has
done nothing on metropolitan tracks so far, made a
sensational record during the holidays. At Ballarat,
three weeks ago, he won every race on the card, heats
and finals, and carried off the pacing-prize in the long-
distance event as well. On Boxing Day he continued his
good work by winning the big handicap in the same
locality and two minor events. The rider’s brother, Don
Jewell, is a well-known Vic. cyclist, and earned some
eminence on one occasion when Porta respectfully saluted
him and Don Walker under the impression that they were
members of the nobility.
♦ * • *
It is gravely announced that the A.N.A. cele-
bration committee has received entries for its big £3so'
cycling contest from Lerna, the Swiss champion ; John
Green, one of the English top-notchers, and Starbuck, the
Yankee long-distanoer, all of whom are to arrive in Aus-
tralia by 10th inst. By the way, what has happened to
Huret, Jaquelin, Linton, Michael and Johnston, all of
whom signified their intention (in the Melb. press) of com-
peting in the Austral, just over ?
* * * *
During the Bendigo cycling carnival, the visitors
were shown over the goldfields, and, after being lowered
to the bottom of Lansell’s big shaft, were handed a number
of specimens for examination. A hunk of quartz richly
studded with gold, and containing close upon 20z., struck
Porta’s attention, and, holding it before the manager’s;
face, he inquired, “ You give me him?” “No fear,” re-
plied the stalwart Cousin Jack. “Me take him Italy
you give me joost leetle one, then ? ” A laborious expla-
nation was entered into, and at last Porta was hustled
into the cage disconsolate. “ Eef I get him,” he confided
to Bilmartin, later in the day, “ I keep him always ; show
the loaf of ze peepel Australia, and how Porta loaf zem.”
Bill smiled. “ I’d boil it down,” he observed. Bill owes,
a lot of his prosperity to the fact that he methodically
“ boils it down.”
* * * *
After the Bendigo (Vic.) cycling sports, on Box-
ing Day, a party of visitors were having threepenn’orth at
the huge telescope which an itinerant astronomer was ex-
hibiting in Pall Mall. Bilmartin was one of the crowd,
and, as he pressed his eye to the aperture, the ’scope hap-
pened to be turned on the ringed planet Saturn. Bill
heaved a mighty breath and stood transfixed. At last he
turned. “ Guess that’s about the neatest bicycle track in
the universe,” he remarked. And thus was Saturn
summed up by Bilmartin.
♦ * * *
The Red Bird and Dunlop people, recently so
/ike brothers that they joined forces to pace Bilmartin in
his match with Parsons, are now at daggers drawn, and
the men of Tyre are combing Australia for a man to
permanently down the iron-jawed one. Lewis, when he
recovers from his accident, will have the Dunlop pacers;
at his disposal in his match with the Yank.
* * » *
Porta wildly challenges any Italian in Aus-
tralia to a match over whatever distance he likes to name 1
for £5O a side, and especially directs his offer to Boidi.
“ Boidi, he skite, ‘ Porta, pooh, me lose Porta.’ Now
Porta’s pocket skite,” excitedly remarked the challenger
as he gave out his intention to a Melbourne reporter.
The challenge is said to be due to the superior
Boidi’s refusing to pal-up with his CQmpatriots- here.
Touched on the subject he remarked : “ Me, Boidi, me
doctor my country. Maccaroni, pah ! he oyster man-
Sardino, pooh ! he sell bananas. Me, Boidi, doctor.”
* * * *
Cyclists are really the most modest of all ath-
letes. After the preliminary heats of the last Austral
were run, the competitor who had shown possibly the
best form of the lot strolled into a Bourke-street cycle-
agency and coolly offered to ride one of the firm’s
machines in the final heat, provided he were laid the
jigger and £lOO to nothing about the result. He was
politely told to take a walk.
« » » *
What have bike-reporters in general to say to
the following allegation by a Melb. oracle ? “ Pacing is’;
rarely introduced in mile events. It is in this way. The
men don’t want it fast at the start, and they need not
follow the pace-makers if they like. The main thing is to
be in the rear when the bell rings for the last lap. The
man in this position wins five times out of six.” If this,
be logical reasoning what is the value of a mile-“ record,”
anyway ? Two men are matched to race a mile with;
triplets to lead them individually. One man sets out.
with the stern determination to go his fastest for the;
whole distance and beat the record. He and his triplet
travel on their joint “ own,” in opposition to the other
fellow and his triplet. But no matter how fast the pace
of the record-breaker, and notwithstanding that he is
getting the last ounce of strength out of himself, he must
suffer defeat if he retains his lead until the bell rings for
the final lap. The other fellow is bound to excel the ex-
celler, for the simple reason that he has more ground to
cover within the last few seconds. Of which The Bulle-
tin will merely say, in the meantime, that bike-racing
leads to extraordinary conclusions.
* * • *
The greater part of the racing at St. Kilda
ground last Friday and Saturday was a dreary procession
of pettifogging stiff-’uns, going slow with a view to future
handicaps. Only the first-class men cared to make a
decent display, and two or three of the highflyers care-
lessly omitted to give the authorities any excuse for not
wiping them out.
* • * ...
The bike craze has reached Smyrna in Asiatic
Turkey, and a four-lap track banked to allow of 30 miles
an hour records has been constructed for the use of
“ scorchers ” of the Prophet.
* * * *
At a recent N.S.W. cycle meeting the writer
counted over 40 of the hawk-nosed gentry gathered in
the pavilion openly crying the odds. And a certain
wheelman with a pelican beak was the same afternoon
called before the stewards for “ eccentric” riding. Great
Mosesh, how long before wheeling is killed like the other
Jew-ridden sports?
» * » »
The all-engulphing trade which swallows every
cyclist of the first rank has pounced upon Walne, who
has decided to relinquish bridge-building and shearing in
Queensland for a billet in a Melb. cycle agency. Walne is
a rapidly-improving man, and promises to be on the
scratch-mark before long.
* * * *
Damien, who scored his first notable win at
Randwick the other Monday, was the recognised “likely
outsider” for last Melb. Cup. A good many Victorian
followers of the horse seem to have missed backing him
when the right time arrived.
* * * *
Tom, who ran second in the Highweight Handi-
cap and third in the Summer Cup at Randwick meeting,
used to be hacked about Maitland sale-yards, and won a
number of casual saddles and bridles at small bush meet-
ings before his abilities were known. He has won 15 races
in the last 12 months, and has been unplaced only once.
* * * *
In the four days’ racing at Randwick the im-
ported sire Splendor (Speculum—Balhilde) topped the list
of winning sires with three wins to his credit, whilst his
progeny were frequent place-getters. Of the jockeys D.
Cook and H. Keane dead-heated for first place with three
wins apiece.
* » * *
Two hundred and fifty pounds seems a big price
to claim a two-year-old for out of a selling race, but the
S.A. trainer, T. Kiely, knew what he was about when he
secured Tapioca at Randwick for the aforementioned
sum. Many of the S.A. two and three-year-old events
will doubtless be picked up by this very speedy son of
Goldsborough, who will yet be found capable of holding
his own with the best of his year.
» * * »
Notwithstanding the eleventh-hour scratching
■of Cartridge in Villiers Stakes, the public piled their
shekels on him for the Carrington Stakes, only to be once
more “badly left,” as Carbine’s son was again scratched
for no reason assigned at the last moment. Merrily,
therefore, did the aggrieved punter cheer when the much-
fancied Response was badly beaten in Tatt.’s Cup. Isn’t
it about time the authorities made inquiries into these
late scratchings—for which, as a rule, no reason, honest
or otherwise, is given—with a view to the alteration of the
rule ? The public deserve protection in matters of this
kind.
» * * «
The favorable wind materially helped Precaution
when she beat all previous Australian records by cutting
out Carrington Stakes in lmin. 13Asee. Trained quietly
at Rosehill, but few people knew of the wonderful sprint-
ing capabilities of this diminutive filly, who had previously
run a few times very indifferently at suburban courses,
consequently her party managed to win a fair stake at
long odds. So it was alfor her a record performance.
It will be difficult to hand.va • icr out of the Newmarket,
for, though but a galloway, slu looks a weight-carrier.
* * * *
That arch-rogue, Newman, carrying but Bst. 41b.
in the very poor company that contested Tatt.’s Cup,
further discounted his claims to be classed a stayer by
finishing nowhere. Everyone (barring perhaps his san-
guine owner) is now thoroughly disgusted with him, so
he will probably bob up serenely for a big handicap—un-
backed, but well-cursed by his previous unfortunate
backers—and win in a canter. The rogue horse has
ireserves of innate cussedness which no one has ever yet
quite fathomed.
* * * *
Ex-N.S. Waler, Le Var (Caulfield Cup third),
<easily won Westralian Derby at Perth on New Year’s Day,
while his former stable mate, Paul Pry, annexed the
Perth Stakes. In the latter race the Perth Cup favorite,
Inverary, was seriously injured The Cup, probably
thanks to the handieapper’s skill, was kept “ at home,”
none of the t’othersiders finishing in the first three. Still
the chueked-in Destiny, owned by the Premier’s brother,
only managed to secure third place, much to the disgust
of the clever division. Altogether the meeting was a
great suocess, and the t’othersiders scored well in the
minor events.
* * « •
Melb. Age made an amusing botch of a cable-
message the other week. The names Norman (Sir Henry),
Edward Grey (Sir), and Sir (David M.) Barbour came
along the wire, apropos to a royal commission of enquiry
into the West Indian sugar industry. Somehow the Age
mixed up this item with a sporting event, and published
the three names as placed horses in the Staffordshire
Hurdle Race —Norman, 1; Edward Grey, 2; Sir Barbour. 3.
Worse still, the ingenious journal found a pedigree for
the winner, and the ex-Governor of Bananaland was
represented as the joint production of Lucifer 11. and
Norah.
* * * *
“ It’s very bard,” said an ex-jockey the other
day, as he lifted his nose out of the pewter-pot, “to keep
in with both sides. I rode to the boss’s orders and lost
the race when the stewards had the mare backed, so they
rubbed me out. My boss raced for the books. They pay;
the stewards don’t. If I’d won I’d have got the sack, and
as like as not never have got another job, for no one’ll
trust a man that doesn’t ride to orders. As I lost I got
the bloomin’ sack, and quite likely I’ll never get back
again. I was dead sure of the blanky sack either way.
The sack’s the only thing you are sure about the way
things go now.”

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I w'rite you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six'years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W."
“ 'Ve, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchilis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other lending residents.

Health and Strength
RESTORED
BY THE USE OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, Says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe
attack of Influenza, which left me
very weak, without energy, appe-
tite, or interest in life. Obtaining
little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recom-
mended to me, I finally tried Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and from that time,
began to gain health and strength,
I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very
great pleasure in telling my friends
of the merits of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier
known.”

It is not generally known that the late

also the discoverer of the new Membare goldfield
in N. Guinea.
The scaffold of Melbourne gaol is so
arranged that, after the drop has fallen, a patent
catch retains the trap-door, to prevent it swinging
back and striking the suspended hangee on the
head. And yet there are certain narrow-minded
people who contend that present treatment of the
criminal is brutal and devoid of all instincts of

What strikes the t’othersider first in the
agricultural districts of W. A. is the mild hope-
lessness of the old settled inhabitant. The
second thing that strikes him is the far-off, upward
expression in the old settler’s eye, his slowness of
speech, the listless hang of his limbs, his general
looniness, and his uncomplaining patience. In his
own way, the confirmed Westralian is a good
employer. He doesn’t drive his employe hard in
the desire to make money, for he never expects to
make any. If a thing isn’t done to-day it may as
well be done to-morrow, or next day, or next year,
or some other time. If it is never done at all it
probably doesn’t matter much. There is so much
space, and so much time, and so much sand and
Scrub, and such vast areas of everything that the
vastness of them has settled down on the soul of
the old Westralian and squashed it out flat. In
the old days places were so far apart that no one
ever seriously expected to get anywhere, and they
were so much alike that any other place would do
as well. There was so much wilderness in propor-
tion to population that no one ever seriously
hoped to do anything with it. The ancient
Westralian in places far away from the boom
looks like a man who has been sent out alone into
the universe to clear away chaos with a shovel
and has-been floored by the vastness of the con-
tract.
“ The Patents, Trade Marks and Copyright
Laws form one of the most complicated branches
of legal science.” This is true, and it is practi-
cally impossible for any one unacquainted with
their technicalities to draw specifications and
claims, &c., that will stand the test of a law-suit.
Hitherto expert Patent agents have made charges
simply prohibitive to most inventors, but Mr.
Arthur Griffith, M.L.A., of 39 Castlereagh-
street (next Hotel Australia), Sydney, and Bolton-
street, Newcastle, having established reciprocal
arrangement with leading Patent agents in all the
principal countries in the world is now prepared
to do the work accurately and effectively at rates
that will place a patent within reach of the poorest
inventor. For the sum of £2O (exclusive of cost of
drawings) he will obtain a certificate of Provisional
Protection (in the first instance) for any invention
in the seven Australasian colonies and Great
Britain, and full Patents all over the world at
similarly reasonable rates. Mr. Griffith also
makes a specialty of designing and registering
Trade Marks and Copyrights.*
During a Clarence River flood, a year or
two back, a bull swam some distance and alighted
on the verandah of a house, where he stayed until
the water receded. When dry enough he pro-
menaded the verandah with a view of ascertaining
his whereabouts, and was astonished to find, on
glancing through a glass door as he was passing,
another bull. He challenged and charged, but
when he had smashed the door his antagonist had
disappeared. A hasty glance round the room (in
which, by the way, hung a splendid mirror) re-
vealed the late assailed, and again the attack was
made. This time bull No. 1 completely van-
quished bull No. 2, and left the scene triumphant
with the mirror-frame round his neck and much
lace curtains and antimacassars on his horns.

- - - MIRACULO ,'S CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
wduld be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian. Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “ Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies."

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of jour
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,

Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
trj'your Alfaline Remedies. I ant thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.

A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J- RILLERIDGE,
Lucknow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal bind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,
WILLIAM HANSON,

him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will

but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press:—

fore the public for over ten years.”
N.Z. Mail, Wellington.—“ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
The Australian Workman, Ss’dney.—“Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the world, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Australisclic Zeitung, Brisbane.—“We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Anstrnlian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.”

who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

FULL PARTICULARS OF A REMARK-
ABLE RECOVERY.
A SENSATION AT ULTIMO.
One of the best-known residents of Ultimo,
Sydney, is Mr. Thomas Jarvis, who resides at 45
Crown-lane. A multitude of his acquaintances
were grieved to notice how his fine physique was
slowly but surely being undermined by an in-
sidious and mysterious malady. The disease
baffled all who attempted to diagnose it, mean-
while Jarvis suffered agonies mentally and physi-
cally. His trouble developed at last so rapidly
that he was
FORCED TO HIS BED,
and his torture becoming unendurable, large
quantities of opium and morphia were adminis-
tered to alleviate his sufferings. He applied to a
well-known doctor, but that gentleman, after a
careful scrutiny pronounced his ease hopelessly in-
curable, and gave him an order addressed to the
Director of Charitable Institutions. Poor Jarvis
went home to bed, and another doctor was called
in and agreed that
JARVIS WAS INCURABLE,
and all that could be done for him was in the
direction of deadening the pains which racked
him. While Jarvis was patiently waiting for the
kindly hand of death to end his sufferings, his
attention was directed to an advertisement in the
press, and, thinking that a case therein stated
resembled his own, he determined, as a last resort,
to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
The first box had a magical effect upon him the
very first week. His appetite returned, and he
once more experienced the
LUXURY OF A SLEEP.
The second week, with the second box of pills,
confirmed the symptoms of recovery, and he per-
severed with the third and fourth boxes with
equally surprising results. He is now taking his
fifth box, and in five short weeks
. AN ABSOLUTE CURE
has been revealed. Every day his strength in-
creases, and, although not yet robust, he is a new
man, full of vitality, confidence, and enthusiasm.
It is no wonder, then, that his case is causing
quite a sensation at Ultimo, and the news is
spreading throughout the city and suburbs.
Under these extraordinary circumstances it was
decided to send a representative of the Austra-
lian Workman to make inquiries so that the
cure may be fully authenticated and the public
may obtain all particulars. So remarkable a cure
deserves the widest publicity in the interests of
SUFFERING HUMANITY
whose maladies baffle all the science, learning, and
experience of the medical profession.
THOMAS JARVIS INTERVIEWED.
On Thursday afternoon, our representative made
his way to the humble home of Mr. Thomas
Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane, Ultimo. He was discovered
nursing a two-year-old baby, and his face declared
him to be one of the happiest men in Sydney. He
was up and about, and able to answer the knock
at the door. Although pale, and bearing still the
marks of a critical illness, and a period of pain, it
was very clear that he was an invalid on the rapid
road to convalescence.
In reply to the preliminary questions, he said :
“ You want to know all about my case ? Well, I
am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts
may be of value to those who are stricken as I
was.”
“ How long were you suffering ? ”
“ Well, twelve months ago, I got so bad that I
had to
LEAVE OFF WORK,
and I have done nothing since then. About five
years ago, next Christmas, I met with an acci-
dent ; I was badly scalded while taking a bath in
Pitt-street, Sydney. Since the accident, I have
been in failing health, and, after four years of
gradual development of the malady, I was forced
to give up my billet at the Glebe Island.”
“ What were the symptoms ? ”
“ Simply indescribable. The pains were some-
thing terrible. They were just about as much as
I could bear. They were for all the world like as
if a
SAW WERE CUTTING MY BONES
in two in every part of me. I was incessantly shiv
ing and shaking, and could neither eat nor slei
On the 23rd March last I saw a well-kno
doctor, and he told me that my case was utte
hopeless. However, he gave me an order to t
Director of Charitable Institutions.”
“ Did you make use of the order ? ”
“No ; I came home and went to bed, and ha
been pretty well in bed ever since. Five wet
ago I could not walk across the floor ; in fact
could not get out of bed. I felt then that it wt
ALL OVER WITH ME,
and only a question of days when I would give
the ghost. My doctor was attending me, and c
all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to et
the agony I was in. I was under him for five
815 L w ® e^s ’ came t° the conclusion that I w
suffering from Locomotor ataxia, or Progressi
locomotor ataxy, a disease of the spinal coi
characterised by peculiar disturbances of gait a
difficulty m co-ordinating voluntary movemen
He told me that I might last for ten years, a
that I might never get the use of my legs. (Ji
then the patient kicked his legs about with ener
to show that medical opinion is not infallibl
Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at
straw I grasped at an idea conveyed by t
advertisement describing the cure effected in t
case of another boiler-maker in England, whicl
read in the Australian Workman, by Dr W
hams Pink Pills for Pale People. I read in t
advertisement of a case which seemed to fit r
own. I determined to give the Pink Pills a tri
anyway, and 11
SENT FOR A BOX.
The effect was as marvellous as it was magic
a £ le and B l eep as fchou ffb w
the matter with me. It was the first appetite a
rest I had for many a day. It was
immediately left the bed and was abTe^mo
about. I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills
during the past four weeks, and am now taking
the fifth box.
I CAN WALK ABOUT
with the aid of a stick, and am gradually, but
surely, recovering my former vigor and vitality.
You see those crutches there ? They are perfectly
new, and I have never used them. They, were
made for me before I got the Pink Pills, but I was
too weak to use them, and now I don’t want them.
All I want is this stick, and I hope soon to do
without it. You see I am rapidly regaining my
strength.” ~
“ He is 100 per cent, better,” said Mrs. Jarvis,
who had come in and taken the baby on her knees.
“The Pink Pills have
SAVED HIS LIFE,
and made another man of him. ”
A friend who called in at this point, said that
Jarvis looked 10 years younger that day than he
did a fortnight previously.
“I can now,” continued Jarvis, “have a cold
bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs.
If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able
to work in two months’ time. I feel that I shall
then be well enough to resume work as a boiler-
maker, and you know I have to be in the very
nink of health and strength to work at that trade.
I am i
BETTER TO-DAY
than I have been at any time during the past five
years. I ascribe all the change and benefit to these
Pink Pills. They have saved my life. I am in
no pain now, whatever, and feel like a new man.
On the mantelpiece there is a box of
OPIUM AND MORPHIA
pills which the doctor gave me to deaden the ex-
cruciating pain. But they can stay where they
are, for I no longer need them. Everybody who
knows me has been amazed at the change in me.
They can hardly believe their eyes. My being
about again has caused quite a sensation out here. ”
Having wished Mr. Jarvis continued speed
towards recovery, our representative withdrew.
WHAT MR. DONOHUE SAYS.
In order to obtain further confirmation of the
cure wrought by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, our representative interviewed Mr. James
Donohue, a step-brother of the patient. Mr.
Donohue was discovered bard at work in the boiler
of a locomotive at theEveleigh Railway workshops.
Eew men are better known in trade-union circles
than “Jim” Donohue. He is a member of the
Iron Trades’ Council and is the representative of
the Boilermakers’ Society. He is the secretary of
the representative committee of the Eveleigh
Railway workshops. He has always taken the
deepest interest in trades matters, and was secre-
tary for several years of the Boilermakers’ Society
of N.S.W. He has held responsible positions in
Victoria, having been the representative of the
Ballarat Boilermakers’ Society at the Trades Union
Congress held in Melbourne in April, 1884. He
was also representative of the Melbourne Boiler-
makers’ Society on several occasions in matters
between the Society and employers. He occupied
most intelligently similar positions in Newcastle
and Sydney. Twenty years ago he was a promi-
nent member of the Boilermakers’ Society of
California, and was Chairman of that Society at
San Francisco. The testimony of such a well-
known and representative trade unionist will speak
for itself.
“Yes,” he said, “I am a step-brother of
Thomas Jarvis, who is now 35. He is a boiler-
maker, and was employed at various workshops,
and was for some time with the Colonial Sugar
Co. at Fiji. He met with an accident five years
ago at the swimming-baths in Pitt-street, Sydney.
He was severely scalded about the legs through
falling over an exposed steam-pipe. He was bad
sor months, but seemed to get all right, but this
complaint, which is a conundrum —I fancy it is a
sorm of paralysis—developed. After the accident
he worked for a considerable time at Glebe Island
abattoirs, and gradually grew worse, ultimately
losing the use of his legs. That occurred two
months ago. The doctors who attended him con-
sidered the
CASE HOPELESS,
and reckoned all they could do for him would be
to relieve the torture he was enduring. He was
thus treated with no idea of effecting any cure.
More as an experiment than otherwise Dr.
Williams’Pink Pills for Pale People were tried.
He took a box a week and the effect has been mar-
vellous. He became better rapidly, and is now
using the fifth box.
I NEVER SAW SUCH A CHANGE
in a man. I didn’t believe in patent medicines as
a rule, but have so altered my opinion that I an
recommending Pink Pills to all sufferers of my
acquaintance. I may mention that my daughter,
Mrs. Thomas O’Toole, of Darling-street, Balmain,
who has been suffering from weakness, is
using these Pills and deriving great benefit. She
was induced to take them owing to their wonder-
ful efficacy in Tom s case. Tom Jarvis expects to
be able to
GO TO WORK
in about two months’ time. He does not want
have much the matter with him physically
follow the occupation of a boilermaker. Ve
naturally, Tom’s cure has caused quite a sensati
among the boilermakers, and they can hare
cremt the news. I recommended the Pink Pi
to Mrs. Cunningham, of 135 Henderson-roa
Alexandria. She began taking them two da
ago. She has heen suffering for 20 years fre
chronic nervousness and affections of the brai
Since womanhood, she has never been out of t
hands of the doctors. Should Pink Pills do
much good for her as they did for Tom Jarv
then there will be another sensation at Alexa
ana.
WHAT MR. LABOR-LEADER M‘G(
•KNOWS.
Mr. J. S. T. M‘Gowen, leader of the
party in the N.S.W. Assembly, was also i
connection with the remarkable case c
Thomas Jarvis. He says he has known
from infancy. He also knew that he had 1
up his work at Glebe Island abattoirs
months ago owing to a malady which he dev
'Awards heard that Jarvis was bed

“Papa’s Hair.”
A gentleman has sent us the following : —“ A few
weeks ago I bought a bottle of your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’
and it has acted with the most satisfactory results.
Previous to doing so, my hair had a mousey color
streaked with grey. The dear children would try
to count papa’s grey hairs, hut, because of the
number, could not succeed. Being only 44 years
of age, I determined to improve my hair, and tried
your ‘ Papa’s Hair,’ and am pleased to write that,
though at first there seemed little difference, gradu-
ally the hair regained its original color (there was
no dyeing whatever) and it is now strong and glossy.
I asked my little daughter this morning to count
my grey hairs, but when looking for them she cried
out —‘ Why, papa, there are no white hairs; mamma
must have pulled them all out.’ ”
frW* This Preparation is not a Dye, but acts gradu-
ally on the Roots of the Hair, and restores Grey
Hair to its natural color and lustre.
, No preparation will make hair grow better than
“Papa’s Hair."
It effectually prevents the formation of Dandriff,
as it is called, the presence of which always denotes
diseased action in the cuticle of the scalp, causing
premature baldness, or a falling off of the hair.
DIRECTIONS.—WeII shake the bottle, and with
a small piece of sponge rub into the roots of the
hair, night and morning, till the hair is restored to
its natural color ; afterwards apply twice a week.

Dr. Service, of Sydney, proposes a new
method of food-preservation— flooding the contain-
ing receptacle with oxygen at high pressure, in
ie presence of a certain amount of moisture, and
len hermetically sealing it by turning a tap. The
theory is that in such a highly-oxygenated atmo
sphere no germ can live. Dr. Service has utilised
the same idea with much success in the treatment
or wounds.

Bulletin correspondent:—You ask
what would happen to a Maori if he proceshed
in Auckland to commemorate the six or eight
occasions on which he made the J. Bull crowd run
for their lives ? ” Well, they don’t exactly procesh,
but they do annually hold an awful blow-out to
commemorate the Treaty of Waitangi, by which
they made Bull recognise them as a sovereign
people fighting for just rights, and recognise their
ownership of the land, and their right to fish in
all rivers and waters for all time. And this is
what happened at Waipatu, where I saw it. The
Britishers rolled up in great force, and only
laughed when the Maoris remarked—“ Py colly,
some time another day long ago we give you ’ell; ”
and then proceeded, to feast (on the cheap) and to
make the Maori drunk (on his own liquor) and
hug his pretty wahines (on the cheap), and then
get drunk on the liquor left by the Maoris of both
sexes. That’s all—no gore.—J.

In the opinion of a Bulletin corres-
pondent, Koo-wee-rup (Yic.) contains more con-
centrated essence of - hopelessness than any other
alleged village settlement in Australasia—not
even excluding the experiment in misery at
Southport, Tasmania. It appears he once
endeavored to settle at Koo-wee-rup, and
kept on endeavoring for three months. Dur-
ing that period all his clothes and most of
his cuticle were distributed impartially on the
jagged points of the all-pervading ti-tree stumps ;
his horse, weakened by excessive chewing of ti-
tree bark, got into a crab-hole and wouldn’t Koo-
wee-rup any more; his wife fell into the “big
drain” twice while trying to catch eels ; his child-
ren were chased by big black snakes, and got lost
and sunstruok on the way to the half-time school
four miles up the swamp ; a deer or other wild
animal from the surrounding scrub-forest came in
the early morning and demolished the few
decrepit cabbages and frost-bitten potatoes in the
‘ ‘ garden ” ; the native-cats or ’possums or some-
thing killed the fowls ; a neighbor, or a neighbor’s
pig, came in the night and carried off the only re-
maining “ fifty ” of flour and half a sack of dried
onions; and a vagrant kangaroo-dog stole the
baby out of the gin-case cradle and only dropped it
after a two-mile chase through the ti-tree. Then
the inspector decided that insufficient work had
been done on the holding to entitle the
settler to half-time employment on the Govt, drain.
More ti-tree stumps should be grubbed, he said.
The poor devil of a villager had built fences with
ti-tree stumps, walled and floored his dwelling with
ti-tree stumps, poured them down crab-holes in
tons, had grubbed them out and piled them up in
huge bonfires that scorched his hair and whiskers,
and burnt down his fowlhouse ; heaps of ashes,
6ft. deep, surrounded the premises, and lay like
sand-dunes up against the impenetrable wall of
standing ti-tree at the back ; and all the time the
house and garden kept sinking slowly down until
they got below the level of the canal, and the water
soaked through the floor and put the fire out.
Yet, despite all this, the inspector wasn’t satisfied,
for the ti-tree stumps increased and multiplied.
At every fresh subsidence of the homestead they
sprang up like mushrooms. It was no use, so the
settler shook the swampy “sugee” from his bare
feet, and gave the ti-tree stumps best. Charles
Dudley Warner and other amateur gardeners
anathematise the American weed called “ pusley.”
They should try to eradicate ti-tree stumps, espe-
cially at Koo-wee-rup.

They Laid Their Snares.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sisters were twins; their absolute
devotion to each other was based upon the fact
that opposites agree. They were Maoriland born
and bred never having sailed beyond its coasts
and they bore soft-sounding native names.
Runa, the eldest, carried romantic sentiment to
a fine point. Her longing was to roam among the
cities of the ancient fables : every taste and inclina-
tion pointed to the civilised and antique.
Airini the younger was agricultural, a daughter
of the soil ; whole-souled in her ambition to own a
model farm and raise “ show-beasts. ” She could
shoot a dozen rabbits out of thirteen, and ride anv-
thing with four legs and every dog loved her
whistle and worked his level best for her with
cattle, sheep, or rats.
Last Christmas there came to Arong-Aromr
station two young men from England with letters
of introduction to the owner, Robert Feilden
1 hey were cousins, one heir to a vast inheritance'
the other proud possessor of a healthy frame and
liver and a capacity for unlimited hard work
The former promptly fell in love with Runa,
the romantic; the latter with Airini, the practical •
and February found them on the verge of a de-
claration, and both confiding in the twins’
brother a lad of sixteen, universally described as
“a limb.”
* * * .
It was an autumn morning such as Maori-
land alone can claim ; an invigorating twinge of
frost in the air, and brilliant sunshine tinting the
bedewed spider-webs which interlaced the wire-
fences. Across the flax swamp and manuka
downs a hundred miles appeared but as a day’s
lounge, to where the purple gullies and golden
spurs of the Hunters’ Hills raised their high-
drawn snow-line against the intense blue of the
sky.
The millionaire, Donald Craigie, paced the
brown creek gravel in front of the homestead, his
arm linked through that of young “Bob”
Feilden. After a while he strolled to the stables,
and the limb ” entered the schoolroom where his
younger sister strummed the jangly old piano in
vague longing for the sympathy music sheds.
“ Look here, Ai —it’s a plant, and you’ve got to
help me,” Bob began.
“Not a bit. I know you—you’re not going to
get me into any more rows ! ”
“ I thought you rather cared for Runa’s in-
terests ?”
Airini faced round.
“What’s about Runa?”
“ Only a chance—a real certainty that she’s
going to see all the pictures—and things at last! ”
Airini gasped.
“ How— ever ? ”
“As if you didn’t know —if she’d only give him
the chance.”
“Well?”
“I’ve arranged it all, but you’ve got to help.”
“I’m not going to side against Ru.”
“No one wants you ; all you’ve got to do is to
stick to me. We’ll take them to the limestones,
then we’ll climb the rock-table, and I’ll help you
up—she’ll have to stop below —and trust him
to”
“It’s a shame.”
“ I only wish someone would plant me for 18
thou, a year. Why on earth she won’t give him a
chance ”
“ Idiot you are ! do you suppose a girl’s going
to say ‘ Ask me’? If a man wanted me he’d have
to rush in and say, ‘ You’ve got to listen,’ and
carry one’s heart by storm. Pouf ! —l’ve no
patience with the modern man who’s got to have
chances made for him.”
Bob pressed a little folded paper into her palm,
and went away;
She read on the crumpled missive : “They laid
their snares about me, they encompassed me as
with a net.”
She laughed a little regretfully as she thrust it
into her pocket.
rut^ —but all’s well that
the Hm , b ” sou g ht Buna and pre-
sented her with a similar note. She read it.
, .don t see the joke,” she grumbled in evi-
late lmtatlon - She was always up in arms of
ril e -W lain by-and-by.” And Bob went off
for a walk with Walter Carey, the impecunious
suitor, who talked with him long and earnestly.
* * « *
At luncheon Bob proposed a ride to the
lmestones, and Airini, without a smile, seconded
tne motion. Runa demurred—it was so hot—and
it would be sure to be cold before they got back.
■Donald Craigie did not look at her, but simply
said he would go—and—she came down in her
namt as the horses were brought to the door.
Walter Carey climbed the hack appointed to
him and turned its head down the drive. Bob
shouted after him.
(( Hulloa, Chicken ! not coming with us ? ”
lam afraid not; I’m expecting letters and
must go to the township. I’ll follow and pick
you up on the way home. ”
Airini s under lip tightened ; her cob bounded
to the sudden dig from the heel which went with
a tierce jab at the bit.
, w l ° an d tw p they rode, Craigie and Airini
ahead, Bob and Runa following.
At the rocks they linked reins to stirrup-irons
and left the horses to browse on the short, thick,
dark-green native grass, and then they wandered
iu .Pong the treacherous limestones, where,
hidden by lawyers and ti-tree, deep caverns with
but a funnel mouth yawned in the seemingly fair
depressions, where the piri-piri and native bracken
grew m the profusion only found in unburnt
corners.
Under a great overhanging weatherbeaten shelf
Donald Craigie halted.
« ”lovely and cool in here,” he said—-
wouldn’t you care for some of these ferns, Miss
Runa?”
"I’m j us k shivering ! ” and she hurried on.
They reached a narrow passage, where the sun
threw off from the white walls a baking radiance.
‘Now, here’s a snug corner ; just'look how this
beach convolvulus is blooming even how,” Donald
cried.
‘I hate it hot! ” and with the words Runa
made a rush to join her brother and sister. But
too late—the table rock was right ahead. Bob
scrambled up, and with his heart in the job
managed to drag Airini to its flat summit.
Runa remained below helpless, speechless,
furious; yet her heart went pit-a pat, not from
anger, but in response to the pleading voice at her
side as they wandered far from the table rock,
and forgot that the world was more than they
two.
Up above, Airini, flushed and beautiful, faced
her brother.
“ It’s mean, and —I wouldn’t be in Runa’s place
for millions.”
“ Not if it happened to be somebody else ? ”
Thwack came a hunting crop across Bob’s
shoulders.
“Pax!’ he grunted, “do you remember the
note I gave you this morning? ”
“Yes —we’re boxed, I know, but as it’s only
you and I goodness ! I believe there are pigs
as low down as this already ! ”
( A smile suited to his pseudonym broadened
“ the limb’s ” features as a scrambling sound rose
from the face of rock opposite to that they had
ascended.
Bob remarked :
“ I’m awfully dry—l’ll just slide down and get
a wet at the river.”
He disappeared, and another head rose above the
flat mossy platform.
It was Walter Carey, furiously red with exertion
and desperate resolve.
She dare not retreat, for fear of what she might
meet below. She could not go forward—she sat
in such a whirl of feeling that speech was im-
possible.
A moment’s silence, then the tide of his emo-
tions reached its limits and overflowed —he spoke
for both, as she at length shyly agreed.
Two hours later.
“Do you think we might venture down now?”
she said.
“They should have got it over—to judge by
. ourselves?”
She did not reply, but in response to her eyes
he whispered :
“ It is only just begun ! ”
Then they turned their eyes to the flat before
them ; in the far distance Craigie and Runa rode
homewards, and nearer' their two steeds stood
waiting. Bob’s horse was absent.
“Why !” Airini began.
“Yes! We needn’t have stopped here at all;
they were far out of hearing—but—you don’t
regret it, do you, darling? If I only had a little
• money like that Pirate Donald ”
“I’d never speak to you if you had ; I like a
man to work his way up—we’ve both got hands.”
His reply as to the quality of hers was lost in
the rattle of dislodged limestone-shale as they
safely reached a footing in the narrow cleft.

“ There was much fuss,” writes a Bul-
letin correspondent from Westralia, “about the
whistling spider discovered by the Horn expedi-
tion. What do you think of a barking lizard ?
The other day, whilst taking away some stones
from a mullock-heap to build a forge, I unearthed
three gaudily-striped lizards about 6in. long and
with beaver-like tails. On spotting the disturber
of their home, they all three began to bark, and
rushed at me for all the world like puppies of a
tender age. Their tongues, too, were similar to
that of a dog. No Munchausen about this. Fact.
—O.H.T. Black Flag, W.A.
Solicitor Snowden, M.L.C. and ex-Mayor
of Smellbourne, has put all the traducers of his
precious profession.to rout. “ Whenever I hear a
person abusing the law and the lawyers,” says this
knighted authority, “ I know that it is for the pur-
pose of covering some design of his own.” Maeau-
lay, Sydney Smith, Dickens, Thackeray, and
every other contemptible scribbler who has jibed
at legal craft and craftsmen were covering dark
personal designs under their dishonest satires.
Snowden knows it. A person who asserts that
Snowdon has personal reasons for libelling the
abusers of the. Law is a liar, and the rule that
nearly all men, except lawyers, are liars ought to
be added to the statutes.
A well-known Northern parson, who
habitually heaves great chunks of the Age of
Consent at a suffering public, will be best remem-
bered for one act of magnanimity and Christian
forgiveness which brightened up his hard sectarian
career. In the old days this reverend had a dear
friend, so dear that he fixed the friend’s hard-
sounding cognomen on to his baby son as a
middle name. The baby, however, was not a
success ; he was never a healthy infant, and his
young life ended suddenly under a big marble
monument, with all his three names spelled
out on it at full length, which the sorrowing
parent set over his little remains. A few years
later, when the sharp edge of grief had worn
off, a boom came, and the parson gave
way to the temptations of this world
and “ went for the beans.” No one
knows exactly how it came about, but a disastrous
transaction in which the parson and his friend were
both engaged ended the old comradeship. The
two scattered friends speak no more. It was just
then that the above-mentioned act of pious forgive-
ness came in. It took the shape of a hammer and
chisel wherewith the bereaved parent went to the
cemetery, and solemnly chipped out the middle
name off the infant’s tombstone. And now a long
blank on the stone tells the story of the brother-
hood of souls that will never be repaired. This
tale is a touching example of heaping coals of fire
on an enemy’s neck, or something. Anyhow, it
would make an interesting tract if properly worked
up.

Evidently the New Woman is not a familiar
object in Queensland. At all events, when the
Brisbane police recently heard fearsome shrieks
issuing from a house, and on investigation found a
widow dressed in her late husband's clothes and
with a false beard on, sharpening a razor and utter-
ing dismal cries in between times, they simply
arrested her as a lunatic. The widow had lather
all over her countenance, and said that she was
about to shave herself. If the New Woman isn’t
allowed to wear male attire and a beard and whoop
while she is shaving herself, what’s the good of
being a New Woman at all ?
Now that a Melb. court has allowed wit-
nesses who want to remain dark to give evidence
in court without stating their names, how far is
the system likely to go ? Supposing a Judge in
one of the criminal courts-follows suit, and allows
an unknown man to climb anonymously into the
witness-box, and swear that he saw the prisoner
commit the crime, and then go away as he came
and disappear in the crowd ! Or suppose the wit-
ness is allowed to conceal his evidence as well as
his identity—one thing is about as logical as the
other ; and he sidles into the court with his face
concealed in his hat like one who prays surrepti-
tiously in church, and whispers for ten minutes in
the Judge’s ear, and then the court lifts up its
voice and says that the case is fully proved, and
the sentence is six months ! Or suppose he
doesn’t come in at all, but merely sends
in his evidence anonymously on a post-
card ! And, again, suppose the prisoner is
anonymous as well as the witness, and is simply
tried as No. 18,732. Or why not have the whole
business conducted on the same basis, and let the
name of everybody be suppressed, and let the
evidence on both sides and the speeches for the
prosecution and defence be dropped through a hole
into the jury-box, and the verdict be dropped
through another hole to the Bench ; and if the
accused is found guilty let him be remanded to his
cell, and the sentence be written out and thrown
in through the window ? The law is supposed to
treat all parties alike—at least, The Bulletin has
a vague idea that it once heard something to that
effect.
Dear Bulletin, — There is a material Hell,
and the name of it is Broken Hill. Ordinary
summer temperature about 110° in the shade, with
the hot air jammed immovably against the earth
by the clouds of smoke ever hanging over the
town. Each adult consumes, on an average, 40
pints of liquor per diem. Often the dust is so
thick that lamps have to be lit at 3 o’clock in the
afternoon, heavy clouds literally darkening the
earth. Add lead fumes, bad water, flies, the
deadly monotony of the scenery, and the compre-
hensive ugliness and grime of all things, and they
make a beautiful total.---D.S.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
" Take my advice, and get someone to help you.
It’s not for his sake, so much ; he’s safe enough
for the present. It’s you I’m afraid for, Miss
Annie ; you’re too young for this sort of thing—
much too young and inexperienced.”
Two resolute dark eyes looked up from a thin-
lipped, white little face. “I have great influence
over him, doctor, and you know I’m not wanting
in nerve or presence of mind.”
“ Aye, that’s true enough, as I can vouch for.
Haven’t I known you from a child ! ”
“And I must stay with him, doctor, until he
gets better, or until — ”
A rosy flush softened her keen features. The
doctor smiled, and patted her hand reassuringly.
Nothing had pleased him more than his little
friend’s engagement to that fine young fellow,
Inglewood. Soon she would marry him, and so
get quit of that scientific brother of hers whose
precarious mental health rendered him so unsuit-
able a companion. As for him, he would either
degenerate into unmistakeable lunacy, or, possibly,
recover and do good work in the scientific world.
Dr. Brown did not much care which ; he had little
sympathy with fools whom friends and doctors
warned in vain.
He took his hat from the peg.
“ Oh ! I know you, Miss Annie. You wouldn’t
scream and get hysterical like the rest of your sex.
All the same, you’re a woman, and you’d show it
one way or another. Take my advice, and get a
friend to stay with you. Why, my girl, your
nerves might be gone already, and you’d not know
it, till occasion came to try them.”
“Well, I’ll think of it, doctor.” But she
smiled a little as she closed the door behind him.
She was one of the few women to whom physical
fear is almost unknown.
“Annie, I want you,” came an irritable voice
from the study. The pale-faced student with
features so like her own, but weaker, looked up
dreamily as she entered. “ Sit down a moment,
I’m not quite ready yet. ”
She took a seat beside him and sewed. He was
at his desk once more busily writing, words drop-
ping from his mouth occasionally, as every now
and then he rose to consult one or other of the
books strewn about on the shelves. Once Annie
glanced at what he had written ; she had received
some education, and she saw at once that it was
nonsense.
At last he spoke to his sister. “ I’m getting on
splendidly, Annie, splendidly.”
“I’m very glad, dear.” She had heard the
remark many times before.
“It’s an experiment, Annie —an experiment.
There’s only one thing needed, and I must cut
your throat for that. Now, please, don’t make
any fuss about it.”
He had opened a drawer and taken a clasp-
knife from its recess.
Woman’s brain remembered what woman’s
brain once invented. Annie folded up her sewing.
“ Certainly, Will, but ’’-—touching her pink
blouse —“ let me change this first. We are not
very rich, you know" and I could not afford to
have it spoilt.”
“ All right; but don’t keep me waiting.”
She rose, somewhat hurriedly. He looked at
her with suspicious eyes. She stopped, and re-
arranged the books on his desk; then walked
slowly from the room.
As she had feared, the hall-door was shut. To
open it would risk his instant pursuit of her. Her
best plan was to ascend to her room as quickly as
possible, and there make signals from the window.
If that failed, she must climb down by aid of the
creepers and the big pear-tree whose branches
shadowed her room. The distance to the ground
was not great. The only danger was that he might
hear her from below. It would be better if this
had not to be faced.
Thus she made her arrangements, in one rapid
moment of thought, standing at the foot of the
stairs. She was not consciously frightened ;in
fact, she was amazed at her own fearlessness. And
this after the doctor’s warning that very day !
Amidst grief for her brother, she could not help a
strange thrill of exultation that the danger had
come and found her ready to meet and overthrow
it.
She reached the bend in the staircase. Above
her was the skylight. It was the glass protecting
an exquisite picture, a dazzling bit of blue sky,
nothing more. She raised her eyes to it for a
moment. At the same instant, a sudden pain
darted through her head ; she felt confused, and
stumbled on the stairs. Another minute, and it
was over. She was her calm, collected self once
more.
At last, she was safe in her room, with its small
ornaments and cheap prettinesses. There was a
photograph of her friend on the undraped mantel-
piece. She smiled as she saw it, and hoped he
would be able to call that evening.
Suddenly she remembered what she had come
up for. To change her blouse, to be sure. She
did so, selecting one of print from the wardrobe.
The window was slightly open at the foot. She
pushed it up further, and looked out. A long
tendril of the creeper panted on the window-sill;
and through the pear-tree’s open branches she
could see the road, quite within call. Three men,
stalwart young fellows, glanced up as they passed
along. She watched them out of sight.
“ Coming into the garden ?” cried a shrill voice
from below.
It was her neighbor’s daughter looking up with
flushed cheeks from the plot she was weeding,
“ Not just yet, Minnie; my brother wants me
very particularly to help in an experiment.”
Yet she lingered, half wishing that Minnie
would ask her what the experiment was. She had
a vague impression that it would be better if
someone knew that Will wanted to cut her throat.
She walked downstairs rather reluctantly, till
roused by her brother's voice :
“ Ready, Annie?”
“ Yes, Will.”
He closed the study-door again. She was now
at the foot of the stairs.
Suddenly there was a loud knocking at the back-
door, and, rather glad of a respite, she hastened
to see what was the matter. It was the Chinaman
with vegetables.
“Not to-day, John. I can’t wait.” John
grinned and prepared to resume his burden.
“You see, my brother wants me for an experi-
ment. ”
She looked at him wistfully. How she hoped
he would ask her about the experiment. The
more she thought of it, the more convinced she
felt that there was something disagreeable, nay,
even wrong, about what Will wanted to do.
There were tears in her eyes as she touched the
study door. She had almost turned the handle
when there was another interruption—at the front
door this time.
She hastened to open it, and the sturdy figure
of her young was before her.
He was an unobservant fellow, and greeted her
with a smile. .
“ Got out of office early ; luck, isn t it. lut on
your hat, Annie, and come and have a stroll
before tea. ”
“Oh ! I can’t, Mark. Will wants me very par-
ticularly to help in an experiment.”
“Oh ! all right. I’ll wait in the parlor till you re
ready. ”
He sauntered towards the other room.
“ It’s for an experiment, Mark.”
She stood with her hand on the study door.
“Oh ! very well; I’ll wait here for you.
He spoke from the depths of an arm-chair, and
from behind a newspaper.
She heaved a little sigh, and entered.
He was in time to save her, but barely.

CONSTANCE CLYDE.
Caloonah.
A TOWNSHIP IN NORTH AUSTRALIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ten white men at Caloonah; heat through the
long summer ranging from 95' to 112' ; offices and
buildings built of iron, raising blisters on unwary
fingers that touched it by daytime. Wind that
carried before it endless clouds of red dust.
Caloonah, 100 miles from civilisation, and owning
a store, a post-office, a public-house, and Govern-
ment offices. Outside it, endless plains to south
and west, a bordering of mulga forest to north
and east, and the quivering hot horizon. Inside
it ten white men doing their work listlessly,
taking their rest listlessly, and developing, as the
slow months dragged by, the vacant, dull expres-
sion which speaks of dead hopes, lost ambitions,
and inertness of mind and body.
A big kerosene lamp flickered overhead in the
long room of the Queen’s Arms. Hundreds of
insects lay dying or dead on its shade or bowl.
The hot air was heavy with the fumes of tobacco
and liquor. Jones lay on his back on the floor,
his eyes closed. Johnson, Farnham, and Clowes
played euchre. Meyer sang a few bars of “I
fear no foe.” His voice was thick and hoarse, and
blended with the shrill of the mosquitoes, the
heavy boom of sleepy blow-flies, and the rush of
the wind that tore and banged at a loose sheet of
iron on the roof.
“ that row ! ” Jones was querulous, irrit-
able ; with the greatest effort he lay still, his
hands tightly clenched under his head.
“ But I love an’ fear the glaaaamer thro’ thy
drooooping laaashes seen,” mumbled Meyer.
Redwood leant against the wall, staring down
the low room with its long deal table, wooden
benches, earth floor, and ten dejected, perspiring,
hopeless occupants. “ Can you fellows believe
you ever drank iced champagne, wore decent
clothes, and a rose in your buttonhole, and kissed
a pretty girl? ”
The iron banged louder than ever, and Jones
set his teeth, and pressed his head harder on his
clenched hands.
“ Now, hell ’d be choicer than Caloonah. So
many new arrivals, such gossip, scandal, yarns,
and girls, grand girls.”
Meyer nodded. “Through thy drooooping
laaashes seen,” he repeated, in hoarse bass.
There was a queer, tense feeling in the air, the
overpowering heat, the perpetual wind, the end-
less weariness of life. The iron grew looser, and
banged with steady persistence. Jones rose slowly
to his feet, and staggered slightly as he took a
pea-rifle from a nail. A big blow-fly fluttered
into the lamp, sizzled for a moment, and then
went pop. Jones aimed with shaking hand at a
scrap of paper on the wall, and missed, and then
at a small cigarette-photograph on an upright, and
missed again. , , .. _ ,
“ Stop that ! ” cried Farnham, sharply. Isn t
it hot enough, without adding that noise
and smell to our miseries ? ” ,
“ Besides, you can’t hit anything,” grunted
Neville. “ Why, you’d miss Redwood there.”
Jones laughed, and his eyes were like a drunken
man’s, though he had had but one glass of beer the
whole evening. He swung round on his heel.
“ Oh, I can hit Redwood,” he said, thickly. Bang
went the little gun again, and Redwood fell for-
ward. The aim had been sure enough, this time.
“ I knew I could hit him,” he said.
He got three years, with hard labor, and the
sentence was considered light. And the Govern-
ment, possessing neither heart nor soul, nor
common sense, provided Caloonah with other men
in place of Jones and Redwood, and considered
itself aggrieved in what had occurred. With one
of the new men has gone his wife. Briggs and
Burnham are better-looking than the benedict.
Neville is unscrupulous ; but that story is not)
finished yet, and after all, do even the big sins
count at Caloonah ?

THE ORIGIN OF THE SCOTCHMAN.

And an extra pocket for same in its trews,
He called it Scotch.

In a Melb. hospital they have been care-
fully nursing up the survivor of the recent
tragedy with a view to hanging him, if the law
can so arrange it, as soon as he is well enough to
stand being killed. The said tragedy is one of
many dozen cases in which the double-barrelled
suicide failed to come off. It seldom does come
off, in fact. The average man has so little know-
ledge of anatomy that if he does manage to kill
himself it is generally either by accident or by a
laborious process of sawing himself in many
pieces. Therefore when a man and woman agree
to die together it usually happens that one sur-
vives, or else both—unless in such cases as poor
Dacre’s, whose medioal training enabled him to
do the tragedy quickly and successfully. The
only reasonably sure way to arrange a double
suicide is for the parties to go out in a boat till
they are in deep water, and then tie a big chain
securely round them both, and tie the anchor to
the chain, and go overboard with all this pomp
and ironmongery to sink them and keep them
down. All other kinds of double suicide are un-
reliable.

ALL OVER THE WORLD.
Wimam e. Herbert U. S. N., Takes Ayer’s Sarsaparilla with Him Everywhere Disorders*
Blood and Bad Stomach Cured Positively and Permanently. That is what Avnr’s o nr ._
parilla did tor Past Assistant Engineer Wm. 0. Herbert, wL. ""
V.

7a
V,
Mr. Herbert has been an officer in the U. S. naval service for the past 16 years.
His duties have taken him all over the world, and he has been on a constant go for
several years, tnrough the Dardanelles, around the famous rock of Gibraltar, in the
Mediterranean, through the Suez Canal, about the South Sea Islands, in Hawaii,
round Cape Horn, to South America, Africa—everywhere, almost, under the sun he
has cruised as a navy officer. On his return from one of his voyages the strain told
on him. His blood was in a very bad condition, and his stomach was weakened
and, as he says, he was “ knocked out.” Mr. Herbert says:
“Although I look very hearty now, four years ago my health and physical con-
dition were anything but good. Then it was that I found the constant knocking
about had at last told on me. My blood was very poor and my stomach as bad I
had been cruising about in the service for a long time without anv rest and without
ceasing from my duties. Frequent changes in water and climate,*'such as I exueri-
enced, will weaken and debilitate tlie strongest of us, and I was no exception In
fact, I was completely run down, and when I came home my family insisted on ’call
mg in the doctor. He prescribed for me and did all he could, but nothing came of
it, and I grew worse. As my blood seemed chiefly the cause of the trouble I thought
I would give Ayer’s Sarsaparilla a trial, seeing it advertised to cure such cases I
took a bottle in an aimless sort of a fashion, but when I found it helped mv stomach
and was commencing to clear my blood, too, I thought there might be some real
merit in it, and accordingly began on a second bottle. Well, to make a long storv
short, the third completely cured me and restored me to my old-time health Mv
blood was better than ever, and my stomach did not bother me in the least A
Sarsaparilla cured me Now I take it whenever I feel that my system needs £and
Sarsanarma 8 Tt r h nyS T equippe<l for » cruis * anywhere without a bottle of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla. It has, I assure you, my hearty indorsement and recommendation.”

The Editor of the “CHRISTIAN MILLION”
under the heading of General Notes, on August 20th, 1896, wrote :
“ good article will stand on its own merits, and we may rely
upon it that nothing will continue long which does not, in
a more or less degree, harmonise with the statements
which are published concerning it.”
MR. HALL CAINE.
Author of “The Deemster,” “The Manxman,” &c.,
when speaking on “Criticism,” recently said :—
“ "W hen a thing that is advertised greatly is good, it goes and
goes permanently ; when it is bad, it only goes for a while :
the public finds it out.”
The Proprietor of BEECEAM’S PILLS -
has said over and over again :
It is a fallacy to imagine that anything will sell just because
it is advertised. How many nostrums have been started
with glare and snuffed out in gloom ? The fact is, a man
is not easily gulled a second time; and every dissatisfied
purchaser does ten times more harm than one satisfied
does good. Assuredly the sale of more than 6,000,000
boxes of BEECHAM’S PILLS per annum, after a public
trial of half-a-century, is conclusive testimony of their
popularity, superiority, and proverbial worth.”
