Lambing Down, Again
Onc® more tbe curse of interior Australia thrusts
itself into observation. It is only now and again
that the villainies of the “ Latnber-down ” come
prominently to light. The practitioners of that
form of plundering and poisoning are generally
too expert to have their victims die on their hands.
And it is very seldom that one who escapes with
his life complains. The last time we directed
public attention to a scandalous case of lambing-
down, our attack upon so well-established an
institution cost us dear. We were threatened
with an action for libel. These harpies pay the
law the evil compliment of believing that it is a
weapon provided for them to strangle opposition
with. We had to go to our solicitor and buy advice
as to how best we might avoid being entrapped, in
the first stages of our resistance, into any proceed-
ing or expression whioh could be by a perversion
of justice twisted into some technical disad-
vantage. The demand made upon us was for a
retraotatic a and apology. We refused, of course,
and rofati \ the injured •feature to the legal
remedy prov* od for V i .roi i J t,' u„a oatth*
And, that done, we did not know whether it might
not once more be our lot to struggle against fate
in the form of a Clontarf jury and a Clontarf
judge, the first graciously permitting us to escape
with a farthing damages, and the latter letting us
off lightly laden with .£1700 of costa, in consider-
ation of our having proved beyond shadow of
doubt that our remarks were true, unexaggerated,
and prompted by a genuine horror of the infamies
we exposed. The offender did not find courage to
proceed, but we had our lawyer’s bill for consul-
tations to pay, without hope of refund. Now
we’re going to expose ourselves to the same thing
over again.
• * •
On the 31st of January last, there died at
Douglas Ponds Hotel, near Blackall, in Queens-
land, a man named Henry Wedge. For the ten
weeks preceding, he had been resident at the
hotel, whioh, during that time, was kept by a man
named Edward Curkton Tomkins. The record
of Wedoe’s history, as evoked at the inquiry
held over his remains, runs pretty closely within
familiar grooves. He had been a shepherd. In
an evil day a legacy of some .£1600 fell to him.
He was a lashington, like so many who follow his
occupation. The use he made of his money was
to buy a hotel —the hotel in which he met his
death—for .£1000. After two months’ enjoyment
of the delights of the free run of hia own bar, he
sold the hotel for .£700 to Tomkins. .£200 cash,
and pro. notes of .£50 each. He remained at the
hotel. From the 19th November to the 30bh
January, he lived under the roof with the pur-
chaser. On the 31st he died—<from the effects of
drink, according to medical testimony His host
produced—as is customary under like circum-
stances—-a little bill against the deceased, for
liquors consumed. It presents no novel features
whatever. The last such bill whioh we published
was like a twin to this one. Nov. 19th, grog,
£1 5a. ; 20bh, £1 15s., and so on, day by day,
except a curious hiatus from the 8th to the 13th
January, daring which there are no items But
from the 14th the entries recommence merrily at
augmented rates, ranging as high as £3 16a. for
one day, and dwindling from the 23rd November,
till on the 29th only 10s. worth of grog is charged
to the unhappy wretch, who died on the 31st, in
the forenoon. Bat although the grog entries
eoase with that significant 10a., two days before
the victim expired, on the 30th there was a differ-
ent entry. The mattress on whioh he lay ex-
piring—on the floor, according to evidence—was
charged against him. He could swallow no more
poison, but there was still a profit to be got out
of his carcass—he had sullied a mattress. In all,
he had spent £129 4a. 6d. in ten weeks, for grog
alone—and a mattress. Not for board. This
landlord has exercised the generosity whioh seems
invariable in cases of lambing-down. He had
charged nothing for board and lodging, it was
the same in the last case we commented on. Here
it was all for drinks, “grog” (lambing-down
equivalent term for spirits), ale, porter, and
gingerbeer. So the landlord himself testified,
and, quite unconscious of the hideous satire con-
veyed by his words, he deposed he had charged
oolyfor “refreshments.” Refreshments! Henry
Wedge was, then, simply refreshed to such an
extent that he moved into another world. Possi-
bly, as they term pints of spirits served out to an
Olcohol-poisoned man “ refreshments ” in “ lamb-
vig-down circles,” the fiends will dip cups of
uquid fire in Hell, and, offering these draughts to
the damned, ask them, too, whether they will
nave “ refreshments.”
* • #
Daring the final fortnight Wedge was “ ailing”
very xauoh—we wonder whether the witness who
thus testified did not mean “ beering”—and was
confined to his bed (the mattress on the floor, pre
sumably, for whioh his indulgent host thought fib
to charge on the day proceeding his death) for
eight days. “ During that time deceased was
raying in his mind, eating very little, but would
drink as much as they would give him.” That
seems to have been quite a liberal allowance —
£1 6s, on the 24th; 13s. on the 25th ; 18s. on the
26bh ; £1 2s. on the 27th ; 15a. on the 28th ; 10a.
on the 29fch, However, this doesn’t matter.
Tomkins was urged on the 25th to take Wedge
into Blackall to the hospital. He declined. He
had confidence in hia own tenderness and care —
18s. on the 26th—and expressed his opinion that
no doctor could do more for Wedge than he,
Tomkins, was doing—£12s. on the 27th, Wedge,
however, held a different opinion. On the last day
he said to a woman “ I would be better off iu the
hospital than here ; they are taking a mean ad-
vantage of me here.” So ungrateful was he for
the unrivalled facilities for drinking afforded him
—10s. on the 19bh. this witness once heard
Wedge ask for something to eat, and she heard
Tomkins reply, “ you don’t eat it when you get
it; you had better come and have some whisky.”
After all, Tomkins certainly managed badly. He
only got hack £129 4s. 6d. of the £200 cash he
affirms he paid Wedge for the hotel. But then
he alleges Wedge had paid for none of his liquor
when he died. As Wedge lived under hia hos-
pitable roof apparently from the date of the sale,
it remains unc ytaiu what became of the cash. But,
doubtless, it ’ in f J.* JL ’ "'omkins deposed
chat he “ ooascLucoa Vt edge's guardian.”
This was necessary and humane, as Wedge had
acquired a shocking habit of drinking to excess.
Still had Tomkins “ guarded” Wedge with a
trifle more discretion the latter might have lived
long enough to imbibe the full £200, and the pro-
missory notes besides.
« * «
The depositions have been forwarded to the
Attobney-Gbnerad. Young Chubb fills that
responsible and distinguished position in Queens-
land, we understand. The forwarding of depjii-
tiona to a Minister is a matter of form, we oelieve.
In the last case of Lambing-down ti whioh wo
called attention, the depositions were also for-
warded to the Minister for Justice —a shining
light among the teetotallers. Nothing came of it.
Wo shall expect—according to our experience—
that the maligned Tomkins will produce testi-
monials from bank managers, Presbyterian
parsons, and other responsible persons, that he
always kept the swell end of his pub. in a most
respectable manner, while Wedge was lying,
saturated and poisoned at an average of £2 per
day, on the floor at the lambing-down end. There
is really nothing unusual or extraordinary about
the case. On one occasion, when we had vigor-
ously commented on a case of lambing-down, an
ex publican, lately a candidate for .Parliament,
called upon us to protest on behalf of his injnred
friend, and to assure us that our comments were
quite overstrained, as he himself had sold £40
worth of liquor to a man at one shout—the whole
contents of hia bar ; and then immediately he had
refilled the vacant shelves, sold their contents
again to the same man for an equal turn ; and the
purchaser’s corpse had been found, a week after,
—black and swollen, in the river, he triumphantly
remarked, —therefore the matter wo had made such
a fuss about was a more bagatelle, and we were
very wrong and misguided to refer to it at all.
We can’t quite foresee what damages we shall be
required by an outraged law to pay foi •, his
article. We can only hope that an intelligent
jury will let us off with one farthing, and that a
dignified and devoted judge sitting in the seat of
justice will not inflict upon us more than £1700 of
costs.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Extradition of Offenders.
The subject of international extradition of criminals
is interesting just now, in view of the demands made
by our Imperial Government to the Governments ol
France and America respectively, for the arrest and
surrender of Btbne and Sheiudan. What the grounds
of the demand for Sheridan may be, we have not at
present definite information. The S.M. Hekald re-
marks in a sub leader that “ from all the facts available
in Sydney to day, the supposition of criminal guilt is
the probable explanation.” The expression "all the
facts ” is a suggestio fulsi, as it conveys an assumption
that there are numerous facts available. In reality,
there are but two: the first, that an informer has been
inculpating people right and left; the second, that a
demand has been made for the surrender of Sheridan.
The expression “the supposition of criminal guilt" is
peculiarly suggestive, and opens up a tram of though.
with respect to the entire system of extradition.
Every reasonable man must agree that it is quite proper
that a man who may be innocent should be subject to
arrest and detention on suspicion of guilt. The
British constitutional fiction which assumes that every
man is innocent till ho be found guilty is plainly uu.
workable in practice, at least in its extreme application.
And it is clear enough that nothing could be more
desirable than that all nations should co operate
to assist one another in procuring the punishment
of criminals. But the crucial question is: what een-
stitutes criminality ? This is a point upon which the
systems of different nations are at variance. The diffi-
culty commences when it is sought to discriminate
between social and political offences. The rule at pre-
sent prevails that no nation is entitled to claim from
any other the surrender of a political refugee. This
seems simple and concrete. But it is becoming com-
plicated by the fao5 that divers Governments, our
Imperial Government among others, have been obli-
t rating the ancient distinctions between political and
social offences. In Russia it is reckoned a criminal
offence to do any one of a score of things which in
England are recognized as sacred rights of the indivi-
dual. And in Great Britain special laws have been
passed within the last twenty years to make that felony
which previously had beoa reckoned only as treason.
In Ireland, again, the rights of the individual have
been so curtailed that if similar laws had been in force
n this colony, any man who attended a meeting to pro-
test against Sir John Robertson's land policy weuld
have rendered himself liable to conviction as a criminal,
even if he were not thrust into prison without any
form or pretence of trial. Now it Is not to be supposed
that Englishmen, with their conceptions of what
liberty is, would consent to surrender to Russia
—for example, a refugee Pole, whose offence had
been a public denunciation of the oppression
of his country. Nor is it conceivable that the
people of the United States or of France would
hand over to our Government an Irishman whose crime
had been conspiring to restore the Irish Parliament.
But, on the other hand, when political agitation comes
to a head in the form of murder, the intention is at
once extinguished iu the acc. All nations agree in
protecting the sanctity of human life—at least, in
retail. A man is no less a murderer because political
grievances armed his baud. The assassins of a Czar or
jf a bailiff are equally amenable to international repu-
Ration. The least guarantee for the purity of his
convictions that the welfare of mankind requires that a
despot or a tool of despotism should die, that a man can
give, is the surrender of his own life. Even Brutus
cats bat a poor figure in history, because he calculated
upon absolute advantage to himself when he took the
risks and stabbed C-bsar. Charlotte Cordat was one
of tbe most decent of assassins, because she knew she
was signing her own death warrant with the knife whioh
she drove between the ribs of Marat. But Char,
lotte’s memory has always been tenderly treated
because it was Marat, a plebeian tyrant, instead of a
regal or patrician oppressor, whom she killed. The
Russian who attacked the late Czar with a pistol in his
hand and a bolus of deadly poison in his month was
nearly on a par with Charlotte Cordat. But the s indent
who threw the bomb which killed the Czar and himself
simultaneously was “the noblest Romani of them all."
Me “laid down his life" for his nation. And so it
hould be. No matter what motives a man may pre-
tend, if he take life, he should give his own, "not
necessarily far publication, but as a guarantea of good
faith." And, if he attempts to avoid the penalty by
ieeing to another country, he should be bundled back
i,gain. The point we desire to treat, however, is
his; That, inasmuch as Governments are somewhat
q>t to claim the extradition of offenders on allegations
f criminal offences, free nations will soon have to
•ecognise the need of something more than a mere
accusation before giving up the alleged criminal. Once
,n the power of their pursuers, the captive is liable,
tven if proved innocent of the offence recognised as one
rhioh. involves ex'radition, to be detained and put on
iis trial for some other whioh would not have been
•eoognised as sufficient reason for his extradition.
Mr. Dillon, P.M.
It is natural that people who have a vested interest iu
orruption should chafe at the abolition of metropolitan
xonorary magistrates and abuse the stipendiaries—say
Mr. Dillon, hive watched Mr, Diiloh's
aagisterial career closely. When he was appointed, wa
vere the only paper which quoted against him words
J rom his own month. But he has now prjved himself
.0 be a man who dares to do his duty and to decide a
case according to evidence. The worst thing Mr.
Dillon s bitterest enemy can say of him is that he, oae
man in ten thousand, has been strong enough to over-
come a failing which has dragged our brightest geniuses
to the grave. Mr. Dillon is hated by many of the pub-
lieans. It may bo because Mr. Dillon understands
them.

The Protestant Hall Meeting.
The S.M. Herald may be congratulated on the
success, tardy as it has been, of its efforts. The
disturbance it so strongly prompted, and the
absence of which from Mr. Redmond's meeting
it so ingenuously deplored, was duly secured on
Tuesday night The ignorant brutes, who feel
without understanding, who want to the meeting
to interrupt, deserved the kicking out they got.
The meeting was not called to discuss the merits
of anything. It was one of persons who desired
to protest against Mr. Redmond’s mission, and
who, in so assembling, were merely exercising
undeniable rights. '1 he rowdies who tried to
stifle the speakers by clamour, merely evinced the
same spirit as the insensate bigots who sought to
stifle Mr. Redmond’s voice by refusing him a
place in which to speak. The means adopted
vax ied, but the want of sense and the blindness
to principle ware the same. It is passionate and
unprincipled men such as these, on both sides,
who injure the cause they fain would serve, and
who obscure the view of any subject which candid
investigation would afford, by raising up a veil of
irritation and excitement. At the same time,
there is reason to believe that the accounts of the
disturbance given by the 8. M. Herald are
gross exaggerations. The Daily Telegraph
has rivalled that journal in the unreason and fury
of its partizan and has evinced an
infatuated anxiety to magnify aught which would
discredit the representations of Mr. Redmond. It
might, then, be relied upon to make the moat of
any disturbances which occurred on Tuesday
night. Yet, whereas the Herald devoted nearly
a column of its space—no “want of space” on
this occasion—to a flaming description of the
disorder, and narrated an episode, so told as
to convey the impression that Sir Henry
Parkes — so long known as a saint — was
nearly made a martyr, the Daily Telegraph
summarised the whole affair by remarking that
“ There had evidently been an organised attempt
to disturb the meeting, as three or four noted
New Zealand Land Leaguers were seen about the
doors, giving the signal to their confreres outside
to howl down Sir Henry Parkes or to glorify Red-
mond. These gentry on being finally kicked out,
essayed a little stumping of their own, but the
crowd was apparently too muoh intent on making
a row to listen even to its friends. The streets
around the hall continued in a very disorderly and
blooked-up state for some time after the meeting
had terminated, but considering all things nothing
serious occurred, most of the damage done being
of a trivial description, if the smashing up of
chairs and fittings within the hall be not taken
into consideration.”
• • •
If the Daily Telegraph be correct, the throng
of rowdies hinted at by the Herald, must have
had an origin identical with Falstaff’s famous
“ seven knaves in buckram.” We won’t pretend
to decide between these contradictory accounts
It is sufficient that there was interruption, re-
sented by violence ; that resistance followed
as a matter of course; and that the mere oc-
currence was disgraceful to the interrupters and
sure to deepen existing prejudices. As to the
significance of the meeting, it teaohes nothing
that was not previously known. It would be easy
to fill the Protestant Hall ten times over with
people who object to Mr. Redmond’s mission, or
with people who sympathise with the aims which
Mr. Redmond claims that the Land League is
striving to accomplish. But considered as de-
signed to be representative of the ablest and best
of our population, it will be apparent that the
meeting was a ludicrous failure. It is only neces-
sary to sorutinise the list of men who occupied
the platform. We append the Telegraph’s
catalogue:—Sir Henry Parkes, Messrs. Abigail,
J. H. Young, R. Smith, M'Oulloch, Mitchell,
Hutchinson, Garrard, Withers, William Clarke,
J. Sutherland, R. L. Murray, Fremlin, Fergusson,
Tighe, Poole, Q. Campbell, A. Cameron, Teeoe,
Fletcher, Q. N. Griffiths, and Melville, M.’sL.A.,
the Hon. L. F. De Salis, M.L.C,, the Revs. Dr.
Barry, S. Sutherland, G Hurst, and D. Sullivan,
and Messrs. W. Neill, W. Hezlet, H. Hicks, J. G.
Anderson, E. T. Penfold, John Way, Montague
Levy, Jordale, Speer, W. Henson, J. H.
Seamer, W. Robson, Kanzie, J. Lutton, T.
Jessep, A. Walker, Aldermen Lees, Brewer,
Vaughan, and Kippax, and other gentlemen.
We give this list in view of the comment which the
same journal offers. According to the Telegraph
this collection comprised “ the ablest and most
iufluential public men and citizens of Sydney.” Sir
Henry Parkes is a politician who has made—
and received—his mark ; but the others, are they
really our ablest and most influential public men?
And as to the “ citizens.” Do the petty retailers
of the tovwi monopolize all influence and ability so
completely that the total absence of all the leading
merchants and educated professional men, is de-
void of significance? These names include at
least a dozen of men who would never have been
heard of outside their back parlors, but that they
have made a profession of sectarian agitation, and
have climbed into notoriety by being loudest in
shrieking what able and thoughtful men would
blush even to whisper. They may seem great
men to the Telegraph, but Australians are not
generally so Lilliputian in their intelligence as to
look up with awe and admiration to men dwarfed
by narrow-mindedness, bigotry, and ignorance.
Of the faces which showed on the platform of tha
Protestant Hall on Wednesday night, nearly one-
half may be seen on the same spot at any Orange
gathering. Is Dr. Barry, editor of tha Protest-
ant Standard, a true representative of tha
sentiments of Australians ? These are questions
which every man may answer to his own liking.
We grant that great gatherings can bo worked up
of zealots on both sides of the contention. Bat
we maintain that there is an overwhelming pre-
ponderance of true Australians who are quite
capable of listening to both sides with calm
impartiality —quite as willing to hear the pleadings
of Redmond as the contradictions of Parkes or
Barry, and perfectly competent to form a delibe-
rate and just opinion as to the merits of a con-
tention in which they have no part and respecting
crimes for v&ioh they have no responsibility.
• • •
By true Australians the reasonings of the
speakers will be critically examined without heat
or excitement, and their influence in swaying
opinion will be proportionate to their cogency
It may excite a smile to read that Sir Henry
Parkes, of all men, proclaimed that he had oouje
to the meeting “to protect the purity of Aus-
tralian public life.” But that is beside rife
question. On reviewing the speeches, nothing fa
so striking as the uniformity of assumption
that the Land League is responsible 4>r
the Phoenix Park assassination. Th a wfrs
repeated by speaker after speaker, in different
forms of words. Thus Sir Henry Parkes affirmed
that “ all the ingenuity and all the sophistrjy
could not by any possibility free that organisatioji
from complicity in the murder, the frightful
murder, of Mr. Burke and Lord Cavendish.]’
The Rev, Mr. Bander said; “Of crime we hXu
enough in Australia; its people did not lach m
passion, but the passion which made a man shoot
another, not because of a personal grievance, but
at the bidding of some mysterious 4 Number One ’
—(‘ hear, hear,’ and cheers) —was surely not to bo
that of an Australian;” and went on to assert
that “ it was this that these two men wished bo
introduce into Australia.” Mr. Poole stated that
“ this emissary of rebellion and treason that came
stalking through our land, with dark threatenings
of murder and assassination lurking behind,
should be scouted from our midst;” and asked,
44 Were we to swell these funds to buy revolvers
to shoot men from behind hedges, and to shoot
men and women in their log cabins?” Mr.
Cameron was more reasonable. He did not ex-
hibit the extraordinary 44 oook-sure-ness ” of pre-
vious speakers. His contribution was that “ we
had quite enough to do with our surplus funds
without sending them into the hands ot men we
did not know, and to be appropriated for purposes
to which suspicion pointed as being of the darkest
and vilest character.” Mr. Fletcher made a
manly speech, marred, unhappily, by the prevail-
ing infection. He, too, asserted, without quoting
his authority, that latterly the League has advised
the Irish people that 44 the only way in which the
Irish people could ameliorate their condition was
to assassinate people in the dark;” and, he
exclaimed, 44 withhold your money from such
a diabolical scheme, and do constitutionally what
these men try to do by bloodshed and murder.”
Dr. Barry stated that 44 the informers had said
that the League was absolutely the employer of
the murderers. There was no getting over that,
and until it was got over, the Land League was
stained with blood, and the blood of the innocent,”
while the Rev. George Sutherland, in less definite
terms, but equally by implication, made the
Phoenix Park murders the ground of his objection
to tne Land League.
• • i
It is encouraging to observe that at last the
fact that Ireland has had outrages to resent was
admitted. This is tie first, we believe, that on a
platform owned by tho Orange body, no attempt
was made to suppress, extenuate, or deny tne
wrongs endured uy that mu xh-suff iriug people.
If Mr. Redmond’s mission iffeots no other go-id,
this would suffice. It must be borne in mind that
the public of New South Wales has never before
had an opportunity of hearing the case of the
Land League from its own point of view They
have been stuffed with representations of counsel
for the other side. The National Press of Ireland
having been either suppressed or placed under
the severest censorship, there have been no
balance in the newspaper quotations or intelli-
gence. The condensed information by cable,
which is the most prominent source ■ f news,
has been invariably drawn from partial sources
Yet the moment a single man stands up, and in
temperate and reasonable language supplies the
hiatus, and puts our public in possession of the
views, objects, and explanations, previously unat-
tainable, a determined attempt is made to howl
him down and silenoe him. We see no distinction
between the spirit which would stifle a man by
refusing him a hall in which to speak, from that
which would still bis voice for ever by a bullet
from behind a hedge. It is the same intolerant,
outrageous disposition, differing only in the length
to which it is carried.
* • •
Now, we agree with the speakers at the Protes-
tant Hall, that if the assassinations in Phoenix
Park were committed at tho instance of the Land
League, as they uniformly assert, it is an unparal-
leled insolence for a leader of that organization to
attempt to advocate its cause in Australia. But
we go much further, and declare that, if this alle-
gation be true, Mr. Parnell, Mr. Redmond, and all
th«ir associate leaders should be hanged forthwith.
And it is the very fact that not only are they not
already under sentence of death, but that the
Government of Great Britain have made not the
slightest motion to lay hands upon these League
leaders, some of whom are walking about the pre-
cincts of the House of Commons every day, which
prompted us to counsel our readers as we still ad-
vise them, not to be carried away by tha passion of
the hour—an excitement clearly manufactured by
the precipitation of the daily journals, in drawing
large conclusions from insufficient information, and
by professional sectarian agitators. We remind the
public once more that except a detached cable-
gram fromaspecial correspondent of the Herald,
whose bias has been notorious, and that item in-
definite and suggestive, not categorical and ex-
plicit, there has not been a single fact conveyed
to the public which connects the Land League
with the Phoenix Park assassinations. We indi-
cated last week, that in the absence of proof, all the
presumptions were the other way and pointed to
the inference that the assassinations were com-
mitted with a deliberate intention of paralysing
the aims of the Land League leaders, who had
just concluded a compact with the Government to
work hand in hand on a basis of mutual conces-
sions. We pointed out that tho League leaders
had not only instantly denounced the crimes,
offered rewards for tha discovery of the assassins,
and in pathetic terms arraigned them as the worst
ememies of Ireland, but had themselves been
threatened with assassination for their relations
with the Government. We showed also the likeli-
hood that the funds as well as the guidance came
from a distinct source, the Fenian Skirmishing
Fund, established in America. To this wo have
little to add. We will content ourselves with
extracts from the news by mail, published in the
S.M. Herald itself the morning after the Pro-
testant Hall meeting, and therefore culled from
anti-Irish sources-
• * •
Thus the Herald’s London correspondent
“ The chief event of interest in Ireland has been
the arrest and preliminary examination of some
score of persona connected with the Fenian
organisation in Dublin. I have previously stated
that the Government officials were making private
inquiries relative to the assassination of Lord
Frederick Cavendish and Mr. Burke. The result
of these investigations is that the authorities have
been placed in possession of very valuable in-
formation as to the doings of this notorious body.
As far as we can gather from the statements
already published, it would seem that the party of
action in America representing the extreme
Fenians of Ireland, have organised in Dublin a
secret committee, now commonly known as the
4 assassination committee,’ who have hitherto
directed and controlled many of the acts of out-
rages and violence that have disgraced the sister
country during the past two years.” In addition
to this, we have the commencement of the exami-
nation of the batch of prisoners in which Carey
was included, and the detailed statement: of the
earliest informer Farrell, who confessed that
4 ‘ seven years ago he was sworn in a member of the
Fenian Society,” and, again, that “ from the Fenian
society this Assassination Society was estab-
lished.” But apart from such corroborative
evidence, common sense should have taught people
to pause before assuming connections to be proved,
before proof has been forthcoming. M early a
fortnight has now elapsed since tho Herald’s
cable correspondent hinted that the League was
responsible for the assassinations. This hint has
never been endorsed by Reuter, and up to this
moment not a single word of corroboration has
been received from any source whatever. On the
contrary, the whole tenor af recent cablegrams
tends to give the idea, that as the first excitement
caused by Carey’s confessions has subsided, a
conviction that the League Leaders were unfairly
blamed has gained force. Let ns suppose that the
next budget of news establishes their non-compli-
oity. In what sort of light will then appear these
“ ablest public men” of the Telegraph s dub-
bing, whose passion ran away with judgment,
reason, and discretion ?
Rogus Degrees and—Newspapers
The S. M. Herald has had its opportunity—and has
put i s own seal once more on its own forehead. The
authorities of the University of Louisiana were applied
to by a Sydney tutor for a bogus degree. Instead of
writing to the effect that a degree of L L D , cost 50
dollars, a Ph. D , 40 dollars i and M A., 45 dollars, and
that a diploma for either would be forwarded on receipt
of the sum named, together with 50 cents, for expenses
in affixing seal, the Dean of the University passed on
the letter to the British Consul, who sent it on to the
Sydney University authorities, who handed it for pub.
lication to the Herald. The Herald complies, with
one trifling but extremely characteristic qualification.
It throws its kindly protection over the imjiostor, and
blathers feebly about the imposition. ‘ We suppress
the name,” writes the Herald, “because, in giving
publicity to the cerrespondeuce, our wish is to stop the
system of getting sham degrees, and not to injure any
particular person." This is the true Herald system.
“We level languid homilies against public evil-doing,
butws do ait wish to injure individual evil doers ”
And evil-doers have been flourishing splendidly during
the past twenty years under this considerate regime.
Suipose The Herald were to write, “An impostor
has been detected preparing forgeries, to be passed on
a'l the business-peop’e of Sydney. He applied to Mr.
Smith, of London, to supp y him with bogus bank
notes. We publish the correspondence, as we desire to
stop the system of forgery, but we suppre s the name,
because we do not wish jto injure any particular indi-
vidual P” What would follow ? The forger would smile
to think how he would have been cornered and ex-
po ed if it had not been for the tender sympathy of
the Herald with him in his misfortune. And
future would-be passers of counterfeit money would
religiously avoid applying to the Smith whose re-
fusal to lend himself to their game had been so
obligingly announced for their guidance, just as
seekers after bogus degrees, encouraged by (he know-
ledge that even when caught they will be let go again,
because the Herald is reluctant to injure particular
individuals, and indifferent to the prospect of the par-
ticular individuals injuring people generally, will
accept the information so kindly placed at their dis-
posal, and avoid the University of Louisiana as utterly
as they will cling to their protector the Herald. This
partial expos6 spreads a stain over the whole teaching
profession in Sydney. That is one effect of the
Herald’s suppression. Boys learn more than grammar
or Latin from their teacher. He never fails to inocu-
late his pupils with some of his manliness, if he be a
large-souled man like Arnold of Rugby. And there is
always a risk tha 1 -, K“"he ffk-*a sneak tlr a humbug and
cheat, he will communicate (he virus of these moral
diseases to boys under his guidance. Bub perhaps the
“ reason ” alleged by tha Herald for its “ suppression "
is not actually the reason which governed i’s pro-
prietors. They may have apprehended an action for
libel. And as they have only been drawing a (rifle of
£50,000 or so per annum, neb profit, from the public for
the past score of years, it cannot be expected that they
should expose themselves to the risk of having to dis-
burse, say £2000, in discharge of their function of
exposing attempts to deceive or wrong that public.
At least, not yet. Wait till they are rich enough, and
then I Bah ! The “ particular individuals” whom
they “did not wish to injure” were clearly the
proprietary, who are very “particular” individuals
indeed.
An Asylum for Inebriates.
Mr. Taylor’s retort on the sly old political dodgers
who have professed to be beyond measure shocked at
his entering the Legislative Assembly drunk, is just the
sort of exposure which is needed. It affords the public
an insight into the characters of those sleek, fair, seem-
ing humbugs who preach very fine doctrines of pro-
priety for the delusion < f the public, and practise on
the sly the very vices they denounce. Otherwise, it is
a wholesale slander. It is a thousand pities that the
electors at the Mudgee meeting declined Mr. Taylor’s
offer to state the names of the thirty-live members
whom he had seen drunk in Parliament during the very
short period that he has been a member. It is to be
hoped, but not at all to be expected, that the Assembly
will take the matter in hand and undertake its own
purgation. Until the names are published, the entire
body of the people’s representatives lies under an im-
putation of inebrity. If it be true that more than a
third of the members of the Assembly have gone to
their solemn duties under the influence of liquor, that
chamber is a disgrace to the colony. Unless it insist
upon having the whole truth out, it will permit the
inference to be established that it regards an allegation
of drunken legislation to throw no discredit upon its
personnel. Who are the thirty-five drunkards? Do
they exist ? Are the seventy odd sober members con-
tent to share their infamy ? Is the public to be per-
mitted to take any thirty-five names at random from
the list of members and bracket them as the
drunken legislators ? The functions of a mem-
ber of Parliament are of paramount responsibility.
Each member wields powers beside which the functions
of a Judge of the Supreme Court are comparatively
slight. Yet if a Judge were to ascend the judgment
seat with his reasoning faculties obliterated or affected
by drink, he would be disgraced for ever, and dismissed
from his position amidst universal execration. While
we have protested, and do protest, against a single
offender less artful than his fellows being made a
scapegoat to divert public attention from the offence 8
of others equally sinning but more practised in the art
of hoodwinking the public, our distinct (.pinion is that
every member who so offeudt—Mr. Taylor included—
should be expelled from the House and sent back to
make the best excuse he can to his constituents And
if the electors should persist in returning < xp&sed
drunkards to the Legislature, it would be well were the
Constitution Act so amended as to make drunkenness
within the precincts of Parliament a positive disquali-
fication for holding a seat for a year or two subsequent
to the offence. The chief difficulty in procuring such
an alteration appears to lie in the circumstance that,
if Mr. Taylor is to be credited, it would be impossible
to secure the requisite two-tkirds majority in the
Legislative Assembly to carry the clause, and put an
end to a condi tion of affairs which converts the Legis-
lative Assembly into an asylum for inebriates.

The Belt case recalls one of a somewhat simila
character brought against the elder Dumas about forty
years ago. His unprecedented fertility and versatility
had led to a very general belief that his stories war
concocted by hired hands, and the affair culminated in
1845 in a ohaage brought by Maoquot that the lion’s share
of the best of Dumas’ writings had been done by him
The claim was supported by critics of authority, but 1
was proved that Dumas only hirod Macquot to hunt u]
subjects, supply accessories, and do other drudgery
Mr. Hayward, Q C, tolls tho story in a charminj
article on tho French novelist.
We don’t know whence Mr. A. G. Taylor hails

a hint as to a Milesian origin in his speech at Mud get
the other day, when in reference to M'Jfllhone’s imputa
tlon that he had been “bribed by the squatters,” he re
torted that at that particular time all he possessed iu
the world was a threepenny bit, besides owing tor a
week's board and lodging 1” The last item of worldly
possessions oauld surely only appear in an Irishman’s

The Mr. Kingston who, in Adelaide, refused
to become president of the new league, is the son of Sir
George Kingston, who was Speaker of the Assembly.
He is a lawyer, and a rising one, and also a member ol
Parliament. In person he is tall and of pleasant ap.
paaranoe, and unlike his father has no wen on his eye-
brow. There is a rumour that once at the Imperial
Hotel, there, ho knocked a man down (or saying art-
lessly, “ Say when," while pouring out sonic—soda.
Probably the reason Kingston declined the presidency
of tha league is that he wants a Local Court Judgeship,
We remarked at the beginning of this par. that Mr.
Kingston was a rising lawyer. Tbat means, dear
friends, that he has plenty ol oases. The more oases a
lawyer has, tha more ha is rising. See ?
A Frenchman among our readers sends us a
different version of tbe origin of the “ Plon.plon"
souDiiqnet borne by Prince Jerome Napoleon. He
alleges it was not Jerome, but Joseph Bonaparte who
had the nickname, and that it was not Plon-Plon but
" craint plomb,” vulgo “ Funk-leal.” “ The nickname,"
writes our correspondent, “ was given him for the
reason stated in The Bulletin; but as it was not safe
in the army to apply to a Bonaparte that coward’s
brand, it was altered to Plou-pion, and conventionally
explained to refer to a habit he may have had in his
infaaoy of imitating the sound of the drum." Tho same
correspondent says, “ Many yarns were spun about tha
ex-Empress, and respecting the legitimacy of tha late
Prince Imperial, but the conviction expressed before me
when a child, was that Eugenie was the only virtuous
woman in the Coart, and those who discussed the
matter in my hearing were in positions to be well
informed."
Aristocratic scandals continue to reach us by
every mail. The last brought inteligenoe of two elope-
ments—of Lady Maonaughten, daughter of Dr. Bussell,
the distinguished war correspondent; and a lady well
knovra in Sydney, daughter of a popular Viceroy. The
Blandtord affair ia rather an old one; his lordship is
eldest son of the Duka of Marlborough, and married the
6«h daughter of the Duke of Aberoorn, formerly Dord-
Lieutenant of Ireland. Lady Ayleeford, the cause of
the difficulty, is a daughter of Colonel Peers Williams,
M-.P., and sister to the Viscountess Daagan. The

A Forbes gentleman points out that Penelope
Smyth, the pretty girl of Waterford, in our Personal
of 17th February, was married, not to Prince Ferdinand
(Bomba), of Naples, but to his brother, Prince of Capua
The Forbes gentleman, who, judging by his pretty
writing, is probably a Mayor or a millionaire up there,
is in a position to speak, because many a time, says he,
•'my fair cousin Pen. used to take me in her pony
phaeton." Well, of course, we never were in the pony
phaeton, which accounts for his knowing more about it
than we do. He confides to us this interesting news :
“ I liked her, but the other one, Gertrude, used to slap
me." However, Gertrude wasn't a bad sort of girl, for
when pretty Penelope’s Prince spent all his money,
Garty, who had married Lord Dlnorben and £60,000 a-
year, helped her along first-rate. When Prince Capua
died, Pen. was left penniless; but Victor Emannuel re-
stored some of her husband's estates to her, and now,
in her 78th year, she keeps up a good (deal of state in
her house, at Brussels, and insists on the servants call-
ing Tom, and Totty, and the rest, "your royal high-
ness.” We didn’t intend to write so much, ionly this
fascinating subject made our pen-elope.
Nathaniel Howell, who lately died in West Aus-
tralia. was an English barrister of marked ability. Per-
haps as a pleader in criminal causes he was. at the time
of his death, unsurpassed by any of his fraternity in
the colonies, and but for one weakness, might have
risen to the woolsack. Suoh was his taot and eloquence,
that where the verdict “ guilty " seemed a foregone
conclusion, he has literally snatched men from the dun-
S eon and gallows. Stern old Sir A. P. Burt, Kt, now
eceased, for so many years Chief Justice of West
Australia, often gazed with horror and amazement
whan ho heard the verdicts poor Nat. Howell literally
mesmerised the jury into giving. In the cause cehtbrd
of the Queen v. Kenneth Brown, for murder, in wkieh
the prisoner’s guilt was, it was well known, not even
denied by himself, he kept jury after jury disagreeing,
till the Judge was almost driven mad, as there was not
even a shadow of actual defence. At last, worn out,
poor Nat. yielded to ** his weakness," could not appear
at the next trial, and Kenneth Brown was sent to his
doom unanimously. Daring Howell’s pleading, only
one juryman held out, all the others, in the face of the
clearest guilt, being persuaded by his genius into a ver-
diet of acquittal.
There is a Maori warrior in New Zealand yclept
Te Kooti. There is also a prophet called Xe Whiti.
The former gentleman, a few years ago, butchered
European men, women, and children, in a thoroughly
wholesale and cold-blooded manner. He was defeated
at last, but never oaught and hanged as he should have
been. The prophet,although a (anatio, is really a good
fellow, and many years ago, when a mere youth, saved
the lives of a shipwrecked party of colonists. When he
went into the prophet lino of life he Jesus Christ
for an example, and taught his people to live peaceably,
i and give up fighting and getting drunk. Mark the re-
ward of these two men. Te Whiti is now a perpetual
prisoner in gaol. Te Kooti was waited on lately by the
Native Minister, Mr. Bryce, who shook hands with him,
said the past was to be forgiven him and they wore to
be good friends in future. If Te Whiti had been a
murderer of his fellow colonists, he and the Native
Minister would now in all probability be drinking
whisky together. Mr. Bryce has been burnt in effigy,
at Walpawa. The effigy was placed on a white horse at
the head of a long procession, tha town band playing
the dead marob On reaching the river bed, a figure
was fixed to a stake in the centre of a pile of firewood.
The effigy was then addressed as the first white man
who had shaken hands with the aroh.fisnd Te Kooti for
14 years. The fire was lighted and tha whole burnt
amid groans and displays of fireworks. TheN. Z Times
is indignant at tha pardon of Te Kooti. It compares
the treatment of Te Kooti, "the bloodthirsty mur-
derer," with that of Te Whiti, “ the apostle of peace,"
and then,in order that its readers may thoroughly under*
staud who the illustrious criminal is, proceeds to quote
at length from the official description of the Poverty
Bay massacre. That horrible episode. It argues, was
dona in secrasy and in silence in the darkness of the night.
It was no warlike proceeding. It was not an attack cm
armed men, or on a fortification. It was a foul, fiendish,
and cruel massacre of men, women, and children, even
to babes at the breast, perpetrated by a band of savages
led on by Mr. Bryce’s friend, Ta Kooti. Some of the
papers say that if ever Te Kooti ventures to show him-
self, he will, pardon or no pardon, be shot like a dog.
Ernest Faveno sailed last week by the Enxine
for the Northern Territory to commence new explora-
tions, He is to rummage the country lying between
the explored track from Normanton to Port Darwin
and the Gulf of Carpentaria. This is coast country, and
what Is known of it reports it quite different from the
plains of the interior. It is believed to be well tim-
bored, and intersected by numerous creeks and rivers—
the hemes of the playfufalligator. Eioh tropical scrub-
lands will, it is conjectured, be found to skirt these
creeks. Altogether Mr. Faveno will have a lively job.
In the scrubs of the North the stinging tree diffuses its
lovely boughs, a touch of which drives man or beast
nearly oat of all their senses, except feeling. Then
under the damp leaves lurk myriads of leeches, so that
if a man chance to be entangled in a scrub at nightfall,
nothing more is ever seen of him, until, possioly,
months later, some other adventurer stumbles accross
a dry skin in a suit of clothes, within which the loose
bones rattle like marbles dropped into a bass drum.
The leeches suck tha unfortunate till his body is as dry
as the throat of a professional drunkard. He faints
from loss of blood, and never wakens till he finds him-
self sitting en the edge of a pink cloud with an electro-
placed jaws-harp between his teeth, humming "There
is a fountain," and realizes that he is in Heaven. All
explorers go to Heaven when they are sucked to death
by leeches in a tropical scrub. They are put in the
same celestial department with the dead clients of
attorneys. Faveno, however, is one of the most expert
of Northern explorers, and is not a likely man to let
himself be benighted in a coast scrub; so that the
lawyers needn’t be downhearted; their chances are not
likely to be anticipated in that way, and as E. F. is
"in" a lot of country of his own discovering, they may
manage to have a suek at him yet. That is to say
unless ho is obliged to swim any of the creeks, because
the alligators will have first snap, in that case. And of
course, there are the blacks. They are formidable rivals
for the lawyer’s when a well-to-do Northern explorer is
in question. They may get a spear into Faveno before
any lawyer has a shadow of a chance of telling him that
“ candidly he believes a stronger case or one more cer-
tain to secure a verdict was never placed ia his hands.”
However, while there's life there's hope. We have
great faith in Fareno's shrewdness ourselves, and al-
though he exposes himself, as explores, to heavy risks
—what between starvation, blacks, alligators, and
leeches, we don’t believe he is se fool-hardy as ever to
go to law.
Prom a consensus of opinions by the English
press on the result of the libel case Belt v. Vanity
Fair, it Is evident the presiding Judge, Baron Huddle-
stone, committed several of the grossest errors. It
seems impossible to doubt that he favoured witnesses,
showed personal Was, and conciliated the jury towards
his own view, in a marked degree. The MornikB Post
says Baron Hnddleetone " took no pains to oonoeal the
impression made on his mind .... to the least
observant it was apparent from a very early stage of the
trial that the learned judge came to the oonolusion,
&c Went need essly out of his way
without a parallel that a counsel should in open court
impute bias to the presiding judge; this, however, was
done." Daily News says he “ made a long rambling
speech" in summing up. St. James’ Gazette states
tne summing up was " a model of all it should not have
been." Pall Mall Gazette boldly says the conduct of
the case was 11 discreditable to the administration of
justice, and to the reputation for impartiality which
English judges have maintained." The Globe says
" bias had been given to the whole proceeding, by the
attitude of the presiding judge." Saturday Review
imputes that the balancing of the arguments ou each
side was "not strictly observed." The Spectator
says " the true trial will be the appeal against Baron
Huddlcstone’s charge.” Aad the Observer observes
that “ the extraordinary conduct of Urn learned judge
was open to exception .... and his Lordship
almost lost his judicial balance.” And many comments
from less influential papers were still stronger. All
this reminds us of a certain judge who tried a certain
case ia a certain colony. So far as wo recollect, he,
also, " took no pains to conceal'’—" at an early stage of
the trial oame to the conclusion"—" went needlessly
out of his way"—made a long rambling speech"—"and
showed bias"—and "lost his judicial balance" Of
course, none of these remarks was made by the influen.
tial newspapers in the colony alluded to. It can be
said, however, for Baron Huddlestone, that all through
he proved himself conversant with art, and displayed no
lack of knowledge. Whereas tha Colonial judge showed
a childish ignorance of the world’s ways that was only
equalled by the ineffable insolence he displayed
towards witnesses whose evidence did not happen to
coincide with his own preconceived prejudices. In case
anyone might imagine we are talking of this colony we
may as well say that the learned jndgeisnot in N.8.W.,
and that we sincerely hope he’ll never set foot in this
country.
Mr. James Harvia Finlay son, editor of the S. A.
Register, is going home, and they have called a meet-
ing in Adelaide to present him with the invariable
“gold chronograph, handsomely engraved, the appear-
ance of which reflects great credit upon our gifted
townsman, Mr. Doodlepop." You all know the style.
This will be the second trip home Mr. Finlayson has
taken. The last time he went he was only a anb. on the
Register. and represented that journal and the Argus
at the Philadelphia Exhibition. His letters were ex.
seeding heavy, but they were correct, and what would
have damned some writers made Finlayson’s fortune.
He was appointed editor, and taken into partnership
Readers of the Argus (for no one outside of South
Australia ever reads the Register) may peruse Mr.
Flnlavson’s copy in that journal once a week. He does
Mr. Haddon’s Adelaide Letter. A little of that letter
will be found to go a long way, since it deals in a tur-
gidly critical style exclusively with the little Adelaidean
politics. The Register resembles in a great many de-
grees the Herald. Especially in regard to its pro-
prietary. The Kiffia-Thomasas—write to them without
puttiu g in the Kyffln, and see what a show you would
have for a professional (or pineapple) par.—are big
young men, with largo heads full of nothing but
commerce and Congregationalism. They can no
more write than the Fairfax boys can, but we
should think they could eat an equal amount of pud-
ding. But while the Fairfax young men have people
to boss the affair the Thomases have only their own
(and Finlayson’s) little intellects to bring to bear on
their paper, and therefore the result is not very bril-
liant. They have a theory, these good people, that
everybody can learn to write. Acting on this principle
they promote their boys from the machine-room to the
case-room, from thence to the front office, and subse-
quently to the literary staff. The effect of this prosaic
proceeding is generally melancholy, bnt never so melan-
choly as when the paper tries to be funny. At one
time there used to be a “ comic” column in the Regis-
ter weekly, which used to be contributed by Finlayson,
J. G. F. Johnson, and the staff. These were called
“ The Crabthorn Club," and their “ papers” would have
made South Head weep. At that time Johnson was
suffering from liver-complaint, and two.thirds of the
other Crabhhorns were lay preachers. Mr. Finlayson’s
biggest achievement ia the literary line was Ms onslaught
on poor old Carroll, when Skeffiagton was retnrned to
Parliament for Light. Skeff. was so soared at this that
he resigned, when, it was proved afterwards he need
have done no such thing. In appearance Mr. F. is
broad and hirsute, has very etern gray eyes, and wears
a number 10 shoe. There you have him ; —and this is
the most space we have ever given to a small man yet.
Sir Charles Lilley, of Queensland, is about to be
banqueted, prior to his departure for Europe, on leave.
Sir Charles is an old resident of Queensland, and has
had an important share in its political affairs. For
many successive vears he sat in Parliament as member
for Fortitude Valley, a suburb of Brisbane, and
thsnoe became known as “the Lillov of the Valley."
He was extremely popular, and the above soubriquet
was varied by an affectionate familiarity which made
him “Charley Lilley " to his admirers. Charley Lilley
was frequently in office as a Minister of the Grown, and
was Premier of a Cabinet which commenced by being,
perhaps, the most popular ever known in Queensland,
and terminated by being expelled by a no confidence
vote, the division on which will always bo remembered
as a political curiosity. In a full house, the Cabinet
were left on one side with but a solitary supporter—Mr.
Jordan, the present Registrar-General of Queensland —
while the Opposition benches were packed like tiers of
a herring-barrel. This extraordinary attitude of the
House was to a great extent due to general credence
having been given to reports that Mr. Lilley had been
altogether too convivial during recess, and that he had
while on a visit to Sydney, and in a condition of super-
joviality, ordered on behalf of the colony, bnt without
Parliamentary authority, several soa-going steamers to
carry mails in lieu of the A.8 N. Co.'s boats, the
Government being at Issue with that Company on a
question of detention of English mails after their re-
ceipfc In Sydney. One steamer was actually built and
delivered, and by the irony of fate she is now one of the
A S.N. Co.’s fleet—the s.s. Governor Biaokall. She was
built by Mort and Co., Sydney. Sir Charles was knighted
a couple of years ago ? after ho had retired from politics
and accepted the Chief Justiceship. Ha refused toao
oept the distinction at first, and as he was known as a
pronounced Radical, a good deal of kudos was lavished
onhis presumed contempt for tawdry honours. It turned
out, however, that his refusal was due, not to principle,
but to psttdshness. He was jealous and resentful, be-
cause Sir Arthur Palmer, who was knighted In the same
batch, was made a Knight Commander, with a pink
ribbon and two extra points to a star of the order, while
ho was only made a Knight Companion, with two stars
less for his breast, or some such nonsense. We don’t
trouble much about gewgaws and political baby.rattles,
and can’t pretend to be accurately posted oa to the
minute distinction which upset Charley Lilley’s oquanl-
mity Anyhow, it was mads right for him. and ho was
graciously pleased to become Sir Charles, after all. Sir
Charles is a man of considerable ability, a pleasant
companion, and a self-made man. His father was a
small tradesman—a batcher, we have heard—in New-
oastle-on-Tyne, and master Charley was a wildish lad.
He enlisted, like Archibald Forbes, in a dragoon regi-
ment, and rose to the rank of full private, when he
bought his discharge, or had it bought for him. Emigra.
ting to Queensland, he articled himself to an attorney,
and qualified for that branch of the profession, from
which he passed by dint of hard study to the higher
grade of barrister. The popularity won in his earlier
days still qliqgs to him, preserved partly by recollection
of his political career, and partly by the unaffected
bonhommie of his manner.

So we left (he window open

Mostly ran on hydrostatics—

Now laid up with the rheumatics.

There was a crush at the Melbourne Supreme
Court when pretty Emelin’s case against the theatrical
triumvirate came on. Her solicitor was Harry Budd,
—or perhaps, under the circumstances, we might say
Happv Budd—and as he b-snt down to whisper legal
consolation into her ear, Emelio trifled daintily with a
silver pencil-case ; probably taking notes of how much
sold she expected to get. Mies Melville wore her
Court Derby dress, plain but rich. A rather large
black hat, with black feather and pearl buckle, showed
off her pretty, worried face just as nicely as ever it
could be. She wore a black dress, and a va'uable jet
black, long fur cloak, lined throughout with the bright-
est scarlet satin, which came flashing into view now and
sgiin with striking effect. Emelie got just the same as
Father Bermiugham, £900. But she earned it better.

And as for the Gaiety, it has had quite a run of
success this week. “The Marble Heart” has proved
to be one of the best drawing plays in Mr. Sheridan's
repertoire. Perhaps this is because it is somewhat
poetic; perhaps, because it gives the gallery subjects
for scornful comment now and then, when the per-
formers speak in French. We have quite an affection
for this incorruptible, democratic gallery: which
affection increases with the square of the distance we
are from underneath the parapet. The first act of the
play, which deals with the dream of the Scupltor, intro-
duces Mi s Louise Davenport, Mies Isabella Gamm,
and Miss Edwards, as the statues A-pasia, Lais, and
Phryne respectively. They are perfectly posed, and re-
main as still as though they were indeed real marble all
through the first act. Their make-up is so good, that
were it not lor their rosy colour blushing up through
tho powder on their arms, wo should feel inclined to
creep behind them and whisper “dinner" in their ears,
to see if they were alive or not. Bat though we
admired them, we could not help speculating what
agony they would suffer if a fly crawled into their ears,
or their noses happened to itch. But we feel while
we give expression to it, that snoh a thought ia low
and unpoetioal. So to proceed with the play.
• • •
Mr. W. E. Sheridan is, of course, Phidias, the
Sculptor, in the dream. Mr. L. S. Laurence takes the
part of “ Qorgias ’’—a gorgias part though we say it,
who should be killed lor saying it. The most noticeable
thing about Mr. Vivian’s impersonation of Aloibiadea
ia the wet towel which that brilliant Athenian wears
round his head. It turns out to bo a fillet at the last.
But tho best thing by far was the Diogenes of Mr.
Prank Cates. It was a most careful performance.
Every word was spoken clearly and distinctly, and the
»oice was well disguised Wa are right well pleased to
be able to say this for Mr, Cates.
« • *
For the aecond act Mr. Sheridan as Raphael
Duchatelot, a young French sculptor, is at times mag-
nificent. In the parting scene with Marco his acting is
nature itself —French nature, but that is in place He
ia passionate, pathetic, manly and childish by turns in
the course of five minutes. And the changes from one
phase of feeling to another are net crude but softly,
shaded as in nature. This is what wo call art. In the
situations, however, where he has to be light and airy
he is not an unqualified success. It brings the tears to
our eyes to say it, but Mr. Sheridan will never be a
butterfly.
• • •
We regret that in the interests of stern impar-
tiality we must state that a similar remark applies to
our lovely Louise, She is not d la Marco. She has not
those little wicked ways which are so particularly dis-
tinctive of the Marco class all over the world. They
come by nature or they coma not at all. Miss Daven-
port is not intended for light, bieezy parts. In the
fourth and fifth acts, however, sle is more at home.
Her interview with Rachael was really well acted. And
what a charming picture she made 1
• • •
Miss Isabella Camm was a nice second. She
has a queer little way of talking through her nose, and
in her burry to come on the stage hud evidently put on
ahat-box instead of a hat, but these are trifles. She
acted with a considerable degree of spirit, and much
intelligence. We believe Miss Camm will make
a good little actress in tin e to come. Miss
Harriet Tullocb, as Marie, acted very cleverly indeed.
Miss Tullooh is pretty, and has some conception of
what the meaning of pathos is. Miss M. A. Melville
played Madame Duchatelet.
• • •
r Mr. Frank Cates in the second part is Ferdinand
Volage, the editor of a fashionable newspaper He
looked superb, but he wears whole boots No editor of
a fashionable newspaper ever did this.. The Shroud is
a fashionable newspaper. He also does not help him-
self to the viands upon the table first thing on coming
m. No editor of a fashionable newspaper ever neglected
that. The Shroud is a fashionable newspaper. But he
delivers all tue acid sentences and rapier-thrusts of
speech which are the peculiarity of Ferdinand Volage,
with, we believe, far greater effect than the vory man
who wrote them could nave done. We have never been
so well pleased with Mr. Cates before.
• * «
Mr. St. Lawrence as Monsieur Veandore is
rather good Bo is Mr. A. Vivian as Viscount Chateau,
margaux. Ho makes most of the laughter of tho piece,
anyhow. We will not say that be does it for the moat
part by the simple repetition of a gag, because that
would spoil the praise. But he does it so for all that,
otul Arthur acts very nicely. Lord Merton (Mr. Sea-
grave) hadn’t much to do, but looked odd as far as wo
could see. And he carries out the contract thoroughly.
Ho is dressed—as an eccentric Milord Anglais, we pre-
sume —in an old plum-coloured coat and a white hat of
a style very similar to one we saw, in a picture on the
head of Abraham when he is saori doing Isaac. Whether
it (Lord Merton’s) had grown white with grief or old
age we cannot say, but there is a tradition that Vivian,
to whom it belongs, used to carry all the " property ’’
of the company in it when he was with Clara Stephen-
son np North. And when the legitimate drama failed
to draw, they would j ust prop the hat np inside with a
pole and improvise a circus with the two old pack-
horses and a dog Vivian had tanght to drink rum. So,
taking all things into consideration, we hardly think
the antecedents of this hat are such as should make it a
fit covering for the head of an English nobleman, how-
ever eccentric. Even the hat itself seemed to think so,
for it was continually falling off. Mr F. Beverley
played Frederick da Conroy. “The Marble Heart”
gives place to “ Hamlet ” on Friday night.
* * * *
Miss Eloise Juno is now sad and sorry. When
she arrived here with a company of pretty actresses ”
and “clever actors,” and announced that she was about
to open at Fred. Hanstead, Esq.’s, Academy of Discord,
we told her that unless she gave away nightly a coal
mine or a tew dead friends, she wouldn’t catch on.
And she didn’t. The show closed up on Monday last.
During the run of “Jeaania Dams,” Miss Juno an-
nounced on the hoardings that her show had made an
“ immediate and electric success.” This announcement
had embodied in it so much of the Mahoodian element
that it made smile even those people who had seen the
show.
• • «
Miss Juno is a lady whose rotundity and whose
aspirations are of similar dimensions. Her ambition
was to star, and she has starred. She played “ Jeannie
Daans” with mournful results; she enacted “Leah,
the Forsaken,” and was forsaken; and her efforts in
“Arrah-na-Pogue” were of a scarcely less melancholy
nature. Miss Juno, if she hasn’t learnt anything new
in her art during her Sydney season, has at least
acquired experience. We trust she will profit by it.
We learn by Miss Jnno’s bills that her success in the
country has been very great; that the reception of her
‘'creations” (all her dramas have been written especially
for her by unknown geniuses) has been phenomenal;
and that “during her season in Sydney che has been
honoured by the patronage of the leading representa-
tives of all the intellectual professions. Profound
lawyers, deeply read divines, skilled physicians, en-
lightened pressmen, cultured principals of educational
institutions, as well as the generous and intelligent
pubic, have already acknowledged that the dramatic
art, as illustrated by Miss Juno every evening at the
Academy of Music, can be made to convey a grand,
eloquent, and noble lesson from the (something—a bit
torn off here; of human nature.” This modesty is
charming. It’s a pity it made Miss Jnno go “np”

Henry Y. will give way on Saturday week to the
“Romany Rye," bj Gaorgo R. Sims, Why not? Gaorge
R. Sims is a clever man, and though melodrama will
seem rough to soma after Sbakespaara, yet ic will draw
more money, since nearly all of R gnoli’s long speeches
are “caviare to the general.” There is a horse in
Henry V , and there is to he a dog in “ The
Romany Rye ” So the realistic business is to be run
on. This we are glad of, for we like realism. James
Allison is, we hear, grieved at the change of bill, since
he considers the introduction of anything Romany in
the excited state of public feeling, liable to lead to a
disturbance. Harry Vincent is the stage manager, and
he announces that his time is now fully taken up; as
one halt the day he has to drill the supers, and
the other half to soitter crumpled roes leaves for
Maggie Moore to tread on.

Mr. Williamson writes us from Melbourne a
letter which has melted our hearts. The caligraphy is
a beautiful round text, the down strokes of whiob are
of a symmetry equalled only by the lines of the Venus
di Mediois—a work, which Alfred will recognise at oioe
as having been a patent medicine advertisement in
the 17th century. James desires ns to state that
so far from personally having any cognizance of the
attack on Mr. Moul, he never even heard of it until two
hours after the occurrence, having been at the Princess’
theatre all the evening. This of course settles it. Wo
know J. C.’s gentle disposition; and we are certain
that he wouldn’t Alfred-Moul anybody even if he were
knocked down; though he might feel a trifle annoyed
if his assailant kicked him afterwards. James has a
habit of carrying a little bundle of religions works in
his pocket, which he distributes to the chorus and dis.
appointed deadheads with a discretion beyond his
years. John StofeTs letter has given ns complete satis-
faction. Even had we supposed for a moment that he
had urged Jimmy Moore on to the deadly fray, the
delicacy of diction, and the ornate eloquence of his
letter would have caused us to forgive him. Why,
hang it I if he murdered a policeman and wrote to tell
us how he’d done it, we would regard him as a hero-
just ;bocause of the joy wo experienced in getting a
communication bearing his immortal autograph.

a shady apple tree on the far side of him, but he did
not see it. He called out to the colonial experience

THE BALLET GIBI,
With complexion like the teio
'Mid the snows.
Due to powder on her nose,
I suppose.
She twirls upon her toes
In abbreviated hose
And exhibits spangled hose
To the beaux.
When cruel time bestows
Adipose,
Fairy parts and all those
She outgrows,
And murmuringly goes
To the very hindmost rows,
To pirouette and pose
With the “ crows."
When life frayed and faded grows,
Like her bows.
She in garrets sits and sews
Furbelows
Till her weary eyelids close
In the peace of death’s repose;
Is she reaping what she sows ?
Heaven knows.

ORANGE AND GREEN.
On Tuesday night we saw a fight.
Such fighting ne’er was sem—
All for those tattered fetishes
The Orange and the Qreoa.
Good people fight I they’re In the r’ght.
Who use the strongest staves—
And when the lot of you are dead
WeTl dance upon your graves.
The Herald, sometimes ready to magnify a
breeze into a tornado, has laboured hard with the
aid of leaded type to impart to tho antiEedmond
meeting on Tuesday night a character it in no way
possessed. The statement In the Herald that the
“Fenians” tried and failed to get an adjacent balcony
from which to harangue the crowd is denied point
blank by the only publican in the neighbourhood. No
body wanted the balcony—the Scotchman says—but if
it had been required—he would have granted its use.
Then again about tho attack on Sir ’Enry Parkes.
There were between 6003 and 7000 people in the street,
and there were only thirteen policemen. Had there
been any desire 11 to tear Sir Henry Parkes limb from
limb" it could have been done with ease. But
people hadn’t gone there to soil their hands—as
far as the tongh old Protector is concerned.
But the Herald may be expected over to miare-
present or suppress. Wait till the Herald has to
battle for the falling cause of big landlordism and
absenteeism in this colony. The Herald s no less
ready to rivet the chains of a N.S.W. free selector than
to cut the throat of au Irish tenant farmer—no less
ready to urge the imprisonment of a trade striker for
protesting against Chinese seamen than to demand the
arrest of a. democrat—whether English, Scotch,
German, Italian, or Greek—we mean Irish. The Herald
had better get ready its tin-plate armour.


PEPPER AND SALT.
This ia gospol. A clergyman in Victoria was
lately moving from his old parish to a new one.
Amongst bis luggage when he reached the station was
a huge box. The porters eyed this with curiosity,
thinking, probably, that the church steeple was packed
in it. But when they beard cries coming oat of it,
they were more curious still. The box was opened,
and ” found to contain a goat, with the horns sawn off
for closer packing." Could this have been the scape-
goat P Whatever it could have been, however, the
clergyman could not, as the local paper facetiously
remaps, prove that it was luggage, wearing apparel, or
even a member of bis family, and, as he couldn’t pay
the fine for it, it was 11 lumbered ” by the statioumaster.
This clergyman, when be dies, will probably want to
carry the poor-box with him.

We see that people have been giving the “ Aus-
tralian Philanthropic and Charitable Mission *’ (all of
which appears to be only another name for Peter Camp-
bell) £16 3s. 61.; and “ the expenses being very high,’’
further moneys are asked for. They are to he sent to
Box —, General Post Office. Now, all this is rather
droll. Here wo have a party constituting himself a
mission, residing (he used to, anyhow), comfortably at
a Coffee Palace, and asking for funds to carry on the
war with. We oan quite understand that the day has
gone by for people to go forth preaching to the people
in a garment of camel's hair. It Peter, or any other
fellow, did that, he would, in all probability, be looked
up ;—and we shouldn’t like to see a holy man looked np
—for long. Then, again, if the A.P.C. Mission lived
like St. John the Baptist did—on loousts and wild
honey,—that diet would, in all probability, disagree
with him ; and if Peter showed it when he held forth,
the dead oat market would be less glutted than ever.
No; it la clear that while St. John was content with
bumble fare and raiment, St. Pater must be clothed in
black, and have his works oiled with superior tucker
thrice daily. And it is but fair to add that Mr. Camp-
bell has a precedent for this comfortable mode of exist-
ence. For, what said Mr. Chadband (?)—Mark.
•* Whence,” remarked that worthy man, 11 do we derive
the strength that is necessary to our limbs ? Is it,”
said ho (looking at the table) " from bread in various
farms, from butter which is churned from the milk
which is yielded untoe ns by the cow, from the eggs
which are laid by the fowl; from ham, from tongue,
from sausage, and from such like P It is. Then let us
partake of the good things which are set before us 1”
We have, of course, no objeotion'lto Mr. Campbell
indulging in good living; none whatever ; and if he
assured ns that the £16 :!i. fid. was to be devoted to
oiling the works aforesaid, we should take it in per-
fectly good part—as would probably (or possibly) the
donors of Mia money.) [There are missions cmd missions.
And we like to understand them. We all remember
Mrs. Jellyby’s mission, wfcioh was to cultivate coffee
and the natives of Boriooboola-Gba. Miss Wisk’s Mis-
sion was to show that Woman’s Mission was Man’s
Mission,—while it will be remembered that associated
with theee good people jvas " a very contentious gentle-
man who said it was bis mission to be everybody's
brother, but who appeared to be on terms ot coolness
with the whole of his largo family.” What we want to
know shortly is what is Mr. Campbell’s mission- Is it
to feed for six days and feed and yell on the 7th P Mr.
C. sent us some time ago a humorous handbill relating
to his mission, but as we could not, obviously, take this
in a serious spirit, wo are now as ranch in the dark as
ever. Wo know that we are getting ourselves disliked
in some quarters by wanting to know several things so
often, but we bear np as well as we oan. We don’tknow
quite what we should do, though, if wo got onrselves

The Protestant Standard warns proprietors
of country newspapers to be .very “ careful in the
choice ot editors,” because there is "an organised plan
on the part of the Church of Borne to supply to every
newspaper an editor or reporter favourable to the cause
of the Vatican.” The country newspaper proprietor,
good easy man, never knew what a gulf he was standing
upon the brink of until now. If he had not been
warned in time, who knows but the Pope in disguise
might have come around one day to edit his paper?
Bat, from another point of view, this might have been
a glorious gain to the good cause. The Pope would,
probably, have died from starvation and bad whisky
before the end of the first quarter. However, from
what we've read about the Church of Borne, if it
wanted to supply newspapers with editors favourable to
the cause of the Vatican, it would remit them from the
Protestant Standard office.

Mr. Posbery’s proposal to import 50 policemen

passing ? peeler to say—“ Cutting it fat now, Jim ;
rather different to the time when ” But after all
we don’t expect the advent of the 59 will improve the
morality of the force mnoh. The only comfort we fool
in the arrangement is that Mahood was a Londoner.
And Mahood didn’t last. These frank and open people

pae? If, like Mr. Dennis (not that there is any com-
parison intended to be instituted), be “ acts up to the
scriptures," he will see that ho ought decidedly not to
possess any worldly goods, and also, that it would be
easier for John Lucas to get through the eye of !a camel
than for a rich man to clutch the promised halo. Yet
we see Dr. Vaughan taking all he oan got, and pleading
poverty! We don’t mind, of course, a priest who is a
gentleman and a scholar taking money, because it’s a
common thing to see rev. gentlemen, who are neither
the one nor the other grabbing at large sums with tre*
mendous avidity. This is a common, though a painful
sight. All we want is to see things put in their proper
light. But we are afraid we never shall see this. At
least, not in religions matters.

In Melbourne the larrikins in court are display-
ing such wonderful legal acumen that the police court
orowa are getting the scare. It is not a case now of a
** fool for a client/' but a "fool for a lawyer.’’ And
thia reminds us that we have aome bright stars of
attorneys in Sydney,"'’ Not long ago, at one of our
police-courts, a certain legal gentleman had three cases,
and having been paid his fees beforehand, went over to
the pub. to refresh. One of these was to defend a
German steward on a charge of stealing a watch,
another a maintenance case, and a third a charge against
a labourer of assaulting the police. Being called out
hurriedly, and having laid in a considerable stock of
rum, he arrived in court in rather a hazy condition.
The woman and the child's father had been called, but
catching sight of t is two male clients first, and the lady
afterwards, he gazed blankly around,'and said—“ Your

Dancing has got its death-blow. Terpsichore
will now have to turn pow opener, and the ladies ot the
ballet will have to return to the deserted wash-tnb
and the forgotten mangle. The giddy waltz will soon
be carried out, “feat foremost, like some gay French
lady" to its grave. There are to bo no more cakes and
alo. The Wesleyan ministers in solemn and bilious
conclave assembled have come to the dismal resolution
—“ That the spirit ot our laws and the usage of our
church from the commencement of its history are con-
damnatory ot the practice of dancing." This is a crusher
for the cotillon, a coup de grace tor the quadrille. We
suppose the Wesleyan ministers will now scratch out
David from the Bible, because he ” danced before the
Lord." And probably they will pass a severe vote of
censure upon the Lord for being a party to such pomps
and vanities. Prom all of which wa infer that the
framers of the laws and usages referred to were either
gouty or afraid to shake up their stomachs.

When Mr. Whiteman bought the gilt obelisk
which stood so long shining back at the sun before the
late lamented Exhibition, people wondered what he
was going to do with it. So did wa. That obelisk was
our hSte noir. We felt it to be a monumental insult to
our poverty. We hear now that Mr. Whiteman is
about to present it to a suburban church to be used as
a steeple. He is a satirist, this Mr. Whiteman. The
obelisk will point up to heaven—much as the jewelled
Auger of the preacher does—and Mammon will smile in
his demoniac sleeve while the collection-plate is humped
merrily around below. And when in the usual course
of things subscriptions are solicited to build a new
ohnroh, the obelisk will probably be presented to
M'Beath when he dies to take with him and brick the
floor of heaven with. The old yarn about the bricks up
there being pure gold is too thin for these times.

Thanks to the cheapness of boots, and the plen-
titdlness ot timber in this country for making clubs,
wo are not much pestered by the religions feuds of the
old country. Now and then, indeed, the toad-head of
some greasy gnome rises out of a crack in the earth
and spits out some of the ancient venom, but it is
crushed into dirt again as soon as discovered. The
rising generation here are therefore wisaly ignorant of
the brimstone literature that arose out of three hun-
dred years of hatred. Merely as an object of curiosity
—a relic ot religious rabies—we present them with one
verse of a raw-head and bloody-hones lyric which we
remember to have heard in Ireland years ago chanted
to the accompaniment of an asthmetic fiddle and a
shrieking fife, the joint noises of which sounded like
what the devil might make if the devil wore drunk.
This is how it goes :—
There is a wee house in Hell
Noine moiles wide,
Noine moiles long.
Built of ministhers' bones,
Thatched wii ministhers* shk-u,
And all the (put in here the whole glossary
of Irish imprecation) gutther ■ blooded, buck-
teethed, black-hearted, curse o’ Godded Orange
men are burnin* for all etarnity therein.
Now this is what we call vigorous verse, good slaugh-
ter-house poetry. We shall not be surprised whan we
go there to find that the Irish language is the vernacu-
lar o? Hell

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO II (Continued).
His lamentation from beneath a dray brought
A touzled wretch, who gazed in brief dismay
Upon the grab; then into active play brought
A tongue unruly, and such words did say
As had bis father’s reverend hairs ot gray brought
In sorrow to the grave, could he that day
Bat hear his boy grown suddenly prolific
In coining language bloody and.terrific
XLII.
Then both held council, and it was decided
To try if Frenohy’s shanty could provide
Some better nourishment, and, as they guided
Their steps in that direction, they espied
My swagman, and esteeming him provided
With cash, they deemed it policy to bide
A whil», and go with him and drink, and *• bust ” him
(Which is a fashionable Queensland custom).
ILIII.
So, when he had come close enough, they hailed him,
And queried whence he was, and whither bound.
Whereat, as one whose strength had newly failed him,
He threw his heavy swag upon the ground
And sat thereon, and, when they asked what ailed him,
He answered with a voice of broken sound :
" Where from ? From home, with all its light and
gladness—
Where to P God knows—save to despair and madness.
XLIV.
“ What ails me ? Everything. My heart is stricken
With all the sorrow that in life can dwell;
Where bright fair skies were, clouds ot darkness
thicken.
And Heaven’s clear face to me is dim as HelL
Bn*-, let’s go on. When I’ve had drink to quicken
My palsied heart, I may find words to teil
Why I am here; and, when I’ve told my story.
You will not wonder why I’m bowed and hoary,”
XLV.
He rose again, and, once more getting under
His bulky swag, tramped on beneath its yoke ;
The teamsters followed him, with looks of wonder,
And to each other in low accents spoke,
Interrogating what, in living thunder.
Could be the matter ? Was he off his strike P
Tney plainly saw tbatsome exceeding trouble
More than his years, had bent the old man doable.
XLVI.
Bough lads weretheee, most blasphemous to oxen.
Whose eyes and livers all day long they onrst—
Their pastimes * drunks,” and rough-and-tumble
boxing,
Their highest aim, the money for a “ burst.”
Large boots they bad, with not a hope ot socks in.
And larger mouths, the homes of chronic thirst;
They feared not God, nor any man or woman.
But yet had in their breasts hearts very hnman.
XL VII.
And in those hearts they felt a quick compassion
For this poor wanderer so worn and old,
For though, in proper bullock-driver fashion.
They always drank, and dined, and swore, and told
Such lies as only high prevarication
And long experience teaches men to mould.
They would not eee a fellow-being sorrow
For all the gold—Victoria wants to borrow.
XLVII.
The night was deepening as they straggled into
The only hostelry of Flagstone Creek,
And filmy clouds did leisurely begin to
Climb up the sky in many a folded streak.
The bar was silent—you had heard a >in to
Drop When full suddenly rang out a shriek—
A horrid crj—and, through the screened partition,
There burst a ghastly blood stained apparition.
XL1X.
A frenzied woman with a lifted weapon
All red and dripping with hot blood new-shed.
A nightmare such as waits the guilty sleep on
Ot some foul wretch who flies to bide his bead
From Murder’s wages—but, be aisy—keep on
Your hair, dear brothers, for there’s no one dead;
All this sounds tragic, but there’s nothing in it—
I’ll prove it, if you’ll hold your whisht a minute.
L.
The thing was this way: Frenohy had been sticking
A stolen sheep behind his shanty fence.
His wife quite recently had had a licking.
And, being drunk, fo r lack of better sense,
Bushed out to where he was, and fleetly picking
His pipe-brand dagger up, did straight commence
To carry on for all the world the same as
Tne hard voiced missus of the Thane of Glamis.
LI,
She stood a moment with her groat eyes lighted
With frantic fire, her splendid hair thtown wild;
Then, all atoncp, she steadied down and ’‘righted"
(The phrase is nautical), and softly smiled.
And knelt, and, in a dreamy voice, recited
Such words of prayer as many a happy child
Tells to a happy mother—oft-times turning
From prayer to beg the light to be left burning.
LII.
The startled teamsters saw that, on a sudden,
Their aged comrade started np from where
He sat, upon a bar-form low and wooden.
And held the kneeling woman with a stare—
An awful look that made the warmest blood in
Their hearts stop^flowing, as he heard her prayer;
They saw his arms Held out, as if to gather
Her to his heart—then knew he was her father.
LIII.
Then, hearing her brute masters step behind her
(The genaine tragedy comes in right here).
She started np, and, with a fury blinder
Than D. Buchanan’s (well! it does sound queer),
Ere anyone could stay, or hold, or bind her,
She drove the knife through him two inches cleati
Without a groan against the wooden bench he
Fell dead as ever died a living Frenohy.
LIV.
A stony horror fell on each beholder
Of this wild deed, and, ere a hand was stirred
To stay her progress, staring o’er her shoulder
At the dead man, but nttering no words,
She slowly sought the door—none growing bolder
To bar her way—and, from without, they heard
Her footsteps slowly through the night retreating,
Then heard no sound, except their own hearts’ beat*
ing.
LV.
Then, from the doorway of the room adjoining,
A weakly sallow child of three or four
Shewed his thin face—he just had been purloining
Some sugar (which he’d sworn to do no more)—
But yet he always took the chance of coining
When rows were on, a little golden store;
He looked complacently upon the body.
Stretched cut upon the floor, all still and bloody-
LVl.
And, touching with his hands the dead face olamm&
He lisped; “She’s done 'im; serve him dam w? 1
right,
He always was a wollopin’ my mammy—
I knon’d she’d knife 'im. She was allns tight."
Then hurried off to see a small pet iamb he
Prized more than parents, settled for the night.
His calm proceedings to the men seemed vastly
To make the horror more unreal and ghastly.

Wei), we don t quite know what a “ fashionable society
journalist" is; out if he has nothing whatever to do
with •• Grub",street, we should think he was a Bum
reporter. Oh, and this recalls to our memory a news
item, that a man died the other day through having his
feet poisoned with coloured socks. What a comfort it

It now seems fashionable in Sydney for “ young
bloods " to parade the lawn at raoe meetings and cricket
matches—especially at cricket matches—with notorious
members of the demi 'inonde. Of course, no one takes
much notice when Mr. .Roddy MMambuok flaunts
Aapasia from Woolloomoolo before his friends' sisters
from a box iu the theatre; but when Roddy “carts'* her
up and down the Association Ground in broad daylight, it
possibly becomes a matter for the ground committee
to notice. In Melbourne they notice such things, any-

This occurred in Auckland, N.Z. A young man
who had be«a married about a week was returning home
from his office one evening and fell into a brown study.
He walked into the house, and, after mating his toilet,
sat down to the dinner table. He did not discover
that he was in his father's house until his mother
softly asked him if he was divorced already. Then he
awoke out of his absent-mindedness, and, gasping out
I forgot all about being married," shot out of the
door witn the velocity of a pressman shooting down a
lane when he sees a creditor coming. When the young
man got home he found his little wife waiting patiently
for him at the gate. This is not the first instance on
record of a man forgetting he was married.
Mr. Howard Vincent, Director of Criminal
Investigations in England, has been exercising himself
considerably of late on behalf of disol arged prisoners
He considers that when they have “ taken it out." and
paid the bill of their offences in fall, they should set a
chance to turn over a new leaf cf life. We think they
should. get a sheep-station and a mansion on Potts
Point. Mr. Vincent gathered a crowd of these ga d-
birds around him, at the “ Thieves Sapper,’* and then
made them a very charming speech about the beauty of
honesty, and the tranquility of soul which aomes from
havin j a moral principle. But the most amusing part
of the affair was where Mrs. Vincent, his beautiful,
accomplished and—ahem—immensely wealthy bride,
presented twenty silver watches te twenty m*h who
hud their situations for more than twelve months
We think some trifling gifts, such as a German silver
or a bronze crowbar, with a complimentary
inscription upon it should have been given to those who
had retrained from robbing their employers for, say
six months, and a wooden meat-axe, painted to resemble
steel, would have been a graceful tribute to the self,
denial of exmurderers, who had not “done for" their
masters during a similar period. Philanthropy is
nothing if It is not thorough.

Thera is a row in Armidalo about the publioana

We leans (and we insert this by way of a ohoer-

an American paper, “ Miss Stokes was surrounded by
her counsel and friends, who extended congratulations
She requested the jury would visit her at her room,
that she might thank them in person; and at about 3
o clock the jury called in a body." We like this way
of doing things very much. Why, when Jesse James'

five murders and twelve robberies), ho was allowed to
walk round the town with his friends, call in at the

At Dapto, one Saunders was bitten on the hand
by a brown snake, and died from sheer fright Imme-
diately after he had been nipped he began to fear death,
though timely precaution (which would have saved an
average man) having been taken, the action of the
pi >ison did not show-itself. He anxiously looked for-
ward to sundown—the time at which, according to n
wretched bush superstition, snakes and their victims
die —and everv hall hour looked to see whether the
sun had set. When it did set, and he found he hadn’t
lost the number of his mess, he revived a little To-
wards morning, however, his own sun set. He died, not
from snake-bite, but from a craven superstitious fear

Judge Higinbotham’s summing-up in the "Wick-
lift'e (Vie.) murder case was one of the grandest judicial
efforts ever made in Australia. The jury disagreed, and
ware discharged. Only one of their number held out
n<ainat a veraiot of guilty. The prisoner was defended
by Mr. Leon, a clever junior member cf the Victorian
bar—one of thenumlerof young Hebrews who of late
years have carried all before them at Melbourne Uni-
versity. When asked by J udge Higinbothara whetherhe
oiuld do anything to assist the (jury, by going over the
e ddenoe again, or in any way, in arriving at a decision,
tne foreman said he could not, and made the startling
statement, “ It is not from the evidence our disagreement
arises." Burns has now been before the Court > n three
charges—chopping the head off his mate Forbes,
poisoning his mate Heenan, and killing his mate
Quinlivan, yet so far it has been found impossible to
convict him. The prisoner throughout maintained his
cool demeanour.
Mr. Sempill, official assignee in insolvency, an
estimable fossil of 21 years’ official standing, died a
year or go back, leaving £11,106 odd deficient in his
accounts. On the morning on which his boots were to
have been audited be was found dead in bed. No one
suspected him of suicide anymore than anyone sus-
pected him of plundering. In fact, it wasn’t till after
the auditor's report had convicted him of embezzle-
ment that people commenced to associate “cold pison"
with the name of Sempill. Mr. Sempill has gone—to
Heaven, we hope—carrying with him the curses of a
large number of defrauded creditors. We don’t par-
ticularly blame Sempill. To go insolvent is to go to
law, nnd when you go t« law you come out insolvent.
The Government will get exactly as much out of the
dead ofllcial swindler’s—we mean assignee’s—estate as
creditors used to get out of the estates he “ wound
up." And now, it is stated in the Press that th*r« is a
big deficiency in the trust account of Mr. Official
Assignee Bandsman, who died the other day—only
£4000 or so.

The late furore regarding the playing of “The

nals in the colony, one is ultra-aristocratic; the second
is most respectably commercial, a miniature edition in

Last October, 30 miles from Cairns, North
Queensland, several Kanakas and a white cedar-getter
went into an aboriginal camp, armed with big scrub
knivei and revolvers. They captured twelve blacks
and after wounding them caught each by the hair of his
head, and chopped it off from the body. One old man,
who could speak a Utile broken English, after being
caught cried piteously, and said “No kill me, me ole
man, no go along camp," but his entreaties did not
save him. The same mob captured a little black boy,
whom t hey fancied, and upon coming near their cedar
camp, they caught hold of the child’s legs and dished
his brains ont against a tree. The aboriginals were a
hrrmless ineffansive lot, and it is said they
did not do the laast thing to deserve any punishment
whatever. This is the story told to the Cairns Tele-
graph. Very likely it’s true. The black police, < ver
whom one Oscar de Satgd slobbars in the Pall Mall
Gazette, have done even worse tilings than i his. Bin
as the officers of Native Police hive te'egraphad that
it’s all a lie, we eupyose that settles the mutter.
On Monday last, the libel actions of John
Davies, C.M.G., versus Messrs. J D Young and Tavlor
respectively, were settled in the Supreme Court. The
cause of action was that the defendants had stated ttat
Davies was employed by Cornwell, Mixner, and Co. to
get a claim which they had against the Government
dealt with quickly, and that ho got £1000 for it. That
other experts and agents had been employed, but had
tailed to get a settlement; but Mr. Davies was employed
by Mr. Cornwell, and he soon succeeded in getting the
claim settled The defendants were not prepared to
prove the truth of there statements, and it was ag eed
that they should withdraw the remark?, and say that
they were not true; and, further, that Mr. Davies and
his witnesses shonld be heard, defendants to pay costs.
John Davies was sworn accordingly, and denied cate-
gorically that he ever had anything to do with Cornwell
or his claims, that he ever went or wrote to the De-
partment in reference to the matter, or that he evor
received a farthing from Cornwell. Mr. Cornwell also
swore, stoutly it was not true Davies had helped him in
the settlement of any acoountsor that he had paid Davies
anything, Mr. Qoodohap, Commissioner for Railways,
swore that Davies had never seen him about the matter.
Had looked through the correspondence-not very
closely. (Re-rxamined). There is a paper which shows
that ha (John Davies P) had seen the Secretary about the
matter. Knew noihli.g of his own knowledge about the
minute, which is by Mr. Vernon. Mr. Vernon deposed
that beg pardon, Mr. Vernon was not examined at
all. Mr. Whittou and Mr. Wickham. Engineer for
Construction and accountant in the Railway Depart-
ment, were also brought to swear that they didn’t
know anything. The latter swore, moreover, that he
had nothing to do with Cornwell’s claim, anvhow. The
Judge directed the jury to bring in a verdict for plain-
tiff for 40s. damages. Mr. Davies recalled, said he
didn’t remember any intima* ion from the depart,
ment in reference to Mr. Vernon’s minute. The jury
requested time to diecaaa the matter; bat on being
instructed again that the parties bad settled the rase,
they complied with directions. Verdict, 40a. Judge
certified for costs. It seems a pity Mr. Vernon was not
called instead of all the officials who wore pat in
the box and had no evidence to give. It seems
difficult to reconcile Davies' sworn testimony that
ho never called or wrote, wi'h Qoodohap’s evidence
that there is a minute by Vernon, from which he
gathered that Davies saw that officer about Cornwell s
claim.

It is considered that the Executive should
reprieve Smith, sentenced to death for killing Captain
Rho b, not only on the ground that he was subjected to
groat provocation, but because certain circumstances
very materially depreciate the value of the evidence.
Smith was not tried until a year after his crime, and all
the witnesses were shut up together on board a small
vessel to discuss the case. It is likely that by repeated
conversations, their individual impressions may have
been very materially modified. Smith had not the
benefit of the best legal assistance and the extenuating
facts relied on for a reprieve were not fully brought
forward at his trial.

occur:—
“ Stand, the ground’s your own, my braves,

Of course we will. The author is, no doubt, Mr. D. W

amongst Mr, Sladen’s relations. It was written origi-

Mr. A. G Taylor said afc Mudgee, in referring
to an escapade of his own, that he had a list of 85
members of farliament, whom he had seen drunk in

Mr. M’Laughlin, M.L. A., alleges Mr. Chapman,

having h ard arguments for about two hours, reserved
his decision, and being called on for it a week after, said
he had forgotten all about the matter, and desired to
ra-hear the case E. B. Smith says ditto. Mr Suttor,
who appointed Chapman, says it's all a lie. Minister

(who beat the Solicit-r-Qantral for Mallow) was brought

execution of Francis Hynes was in all its parts illegal,
and that Hyne was murdered—his counsel pointed out
that John Bright once said exactly the same thing
about the execution ol J. W. Gordon in Jamaica, and
yet was not prosecuted for sedition However, O'Brien
was, of course, committed for trial; he was also, of
course, served, while leaving the Police Court, with a
notice requiring that his case should be tried before a
gpeeial jury, this being the class of jurors whose con-
duct was especially assailed in United Ireland.
Triumph of Protection ! The Victorian manu-
facturers say they cannot compete with foreign goods
and pay the higher rate ot wage granted the tailoresses
who were recently on strike, Weil, if the manufac-
turing greatness of Melbourne depends on starvation
pay to women ami children, then let Melbourne be ever
greater than Sydney. But we don’t believe a rise in
screw at Melbourne means anything of the kind. It
means to the holy bosses of the manufactories—you
mustn’t lay up a store in Heaven and here too. You
must give a trifle to suffering humanity—female
humanity, whom you would reform with the Gospel, and
dishonour with bad pay.
There seemed to be considerable dissatisfaction
among members concerning various items of the Esti-
mates. Mr. Fletcher said, with reference to the Edu-
cation department, that there must bo something
radically wrong when young men got increases, and old
officers were ignored; and Mr. Garrett (who, by the
way, has of lata Loan in a—ah, penitent condition)
spoke very savagely, saying that the Ministry haa
brought forward Estimates which bristled with in-
creases without reason. Either increased taxation or
retrenchment was immediately ahead. The Estimates
were choke-full ot increases and pensions and retiring
allowances, and the latter item should ctrtainiy have
been provided (or by a prop or Civil service Bill. (Hear,
hear.) If that measure were brought iu now, he be-
lieved it would he passed unanimously.
The Herald’s London correspondent, an
enragi jusuflar of the motto, “Our country, right or
wrong," told a beautiful truth, by aooiient, in a recent
letter. He wrote that “ Mr. Gladstone's noble effort to
regenerate and not denationalize a conquered country,
Ma no parallel in history I This is, as Mr. La Fayette
Kittle woulu phrase it, "awful true." The reference
is to the iniquitous suppression by violence of the
Bational aspirations of tha Egyptian people, and while
the r.geaeration is to be effected by maintaining that
flissolute and feeble puppet, Tewfik—a Turk—as Bailiff.
Khedive, by surrounding him with foreign bayonets to
keep the Hurezenerate people from hanging him to his
palaoe flagstaff, the nou-denaTonalizatijn is to be
secured by putting British officers in command of Cir-
oassian mercenaries, and terming the compound the
Egyptian army.
The information by cable that the appeal case,

Leaned, was probably not understood by many who

respect to this 0rm had been frankly communicated by

settlement, His foes, however, were not deterred by
any nicety from going at him. Mr. Miles was able ta

and to political attorneys. He sued M'llwraith. under

Mr. Miles was advised to appeal to the Privy Council.
The cablegram ends the story. The assailants are
ioiled, and M Ilwraith has beaten them at every
point J
i ave been such strenuous efforts made
by the daily journals to raise racial antagonisms in re-
ference to the Irish Question, that there is some danger
that good English Liberals among our population may
be bewildered and misled. With the object of prevent-
ing that mistake, and as an antidote by anticipation to
the representations which are certain to be made, that
any one who speaks the words of moderation and
reason at this moment, when earth and holl are being
moved to etir up hatred and prejudice, must be either
an Irishman or a, scoundrel, as no one else would pre-
tend that the Irish have been outraged; and that only
a con vul sum ary revolutionist could have sympathy
with the methods proposed by the Land League leaders,
we append a few extracts from letters by Hiohard
Cobden, a man who was himself once as fiercely de-
nouEoed as Parneil is to-day, and by the same class—
the landlord caste and its parasites in the Parliament
and the Press. Cobden’s career is oyer. His special work
is accomplished. And the parity and unselfishness of
his motives need now no apologist. First, observe
what John Moriey, his latest biographer, says of the
estimation in which Cobden was held while his cause
wasjetunwon—*'la England it is certain that the
amazing vigour and resolution of the League were re-
garded with intense di-favour by great and important
classes. The League was thoroughly out of fashion,
it was regarded as violent, extreme, and not respect-
yf11 before, it had usually been described as a
selfish and content ptible faction. By the end of 1843
things had become more serious The notorious pam-
phleteer of the Quarterly Beview now denounced the
League as the foulest and most dangerous combination
of recent times. The Times spoke of Cobden, Bright,
and their allies, as “capering mercenaries who go
frisking about the country as authors of incendiary
clap-trap; as peripatetic orators pnffiag themselves
into easy popularity by second-hand arguments. They
were constantly accused of retarding their own o-mse.
and frightening away respectable people, by their
violenae. Violence, as usual, denoted nothing more
than that they knew their own minds, and nrossod
their convictions as if they were in earnest. In the
earlier part of the autumn there had been a furious
turn-eut of the operativei in the mills, and later on in
the season ricks had b d «n burnt in the midland and
southern counties. The League, in spite of the fact
that its leaders were neirly all mill-owners, or con-
nected with manufactures, war accused of promoting
these outrages. There were loud threats of criminal
proceedings against the el-noxious confederacy It was
rumoured on the Minchester Exchange that the
Government had resolved to put down the League as an
association constituted against the law of lha land. If
necessary, a new law would ba made to enable them to
suppress a body so seditious. This heat in the minds
or tno ruling olann made them arxious at almost} any
cost to destroy Cobden, who was now openly recognised
as the foremost personage in tha detested organ! ation.”
tins is exactly the tone now adopted with regard to the
present League. What was threatened against the Free-
trade apostles has simply been actually applied to the
free-land apostles. The League referred to was a
Land League, too ; and, in effect, a league for reducing
landlords rents. It was the famous Anti-Corn-Law
League, the aim of which was to abolish the duty on

Again: “London, July 23. 1818,-What a wretched
session has this been I It ought to be exnungsd from
the minutes of Parliament. Three Coercion Bills for
Ireland and the rest talk, talk, talk.” Once more-
writing to George Coombe, in the same year: “The
great obstacle to all progress both in Ireland and in
England is the landlord spirit, which is dominant in
political and social life. It is this spirit which prevents
our dealing with the question of the tenure of land. The
feudal system, as now maintained in Ireland, ia totally
unsuited to the state of the country. In fact, the feudal
18 not carried out, for that would imply a respon-
sibility on the part of the proprietor to keep and em-
ploy the people, whereas ho is possibly living in Paris,
whilst his agent ia driving the peasantry from his
estate, and, perhaps, burning their cabins. What is
wanting is a tribunal or legislature before which
the case of _Ii eland may be pleaded, wbere the
landlord spirit (excuse iha repetition of the word)
1 8u P rem e. This is not to be found in our House
of Commons. Yon would be astonished tf behind the
scenes in the Committees, and in the confidence of
those men who frame bills for Parliament, to observe
how vigilant the spirit of landlordism is in guarding its
privileges, and how much the legislator who would hope
to carry a measure through both Houses is obliged to
consult its sovereign will and pleasure. Hence the
difficulty of dealing with game laws, copy-holds, and
such small matters, which grow into things of mighty
import in the House of Commons, while the law of
primogeniture is a sort of eleventh commandment in
the eyes of our legislators. I think I know what is
wanting in Ireland ; a redistribution of land, as the
only m.ana of multiplying men of property. If I had
absolute power, I wou'd Instantly issue an edict apply,
ing the law of succession as it exists in France to the
land of Ireland There should be no more absentee
proprietors drawing largo rentals from Ireland, if I
could prevent it. I would so divide the property as to
render it necessary to live upon the spot to look after
it. But you ean do nothing effectual in that direction
with our Houses, and therefore I am an advocate for
letting in the householders as voters, so as to take
away the domination of the squires. But I will do all
in my power in the meantime to give a chance to
Ireland, and I cordially agree with your views upon
the policy that ought to be pursued towards it.”
London, Oot. 23. (1848)—I have to thank you for the
acqTsyAN’ containing the whole of your observations
on .fie ate of Ireland, in every syllable of which I
agree with yon. But excuse me if I say I miss in your
articles, a.a in all other dis.ertations upon Ireland, a
sptoifij plan—I mean such a remedial scheme as might
be embodied in an Act ©f Parliament. And it must be
so from the very nature of the case, for the ills of Ire-
land are so complex, and its diseases so decidedly
chronic, tnat no single remedy could possibly cure
them. Indeed, if we were to apply a thousand reme-
cies, the existing generation could hardly hope to live
to see any great change in the condition of the Irish
people; and this ia probably one reason why politicians
ui.d ministers of the day do not commit their fortunes
to tne causa of justice to Ireland. I have but one
p.an, but 1 don't know how to enforce it. Cut up the
.and into small properties. Let there be no estates so
large as to favour absenteeism, even from the prtish.
How is this to be done, with feudalism still in the
ai Cendant in Pirliament and in tha Cabinet? Pim is
quite right when be draws tha distinction between the
case of Ireland, where the conquerors have not amalga-
mated with the conquer d, and tnat of other countries,
w flare the victors and vanquished have been invariably
blended. For we are all conquered nations—some of
us hive been so repeatedly—but all, with the exception
of -Iceland, have absorbed their oonqueiors. Almost
every crime and outrage in Ireland is connected with
the occupation or ownership of land ; and yet tno Irish
are not naturally an agrioultu-al people, for they alone,
of all the European emigrants who arrive in the United
Stales, linger about the towns, and hisitateto avail
themselves of the tempting advantages of the rural
districts in the interior. But in Ireland, at least south
and west, there is no property but tha soil, ani no
labour but upon the land, and you cannot reach the popu-
lation in their material or moral condition but through
the proprietorship of the laud. Therefore, if I had the
power, X would always make the proprietors of the

Boil resident, by breaking up the large properties In
other words, I would give Ireland (to the Irish ”
And in October, 1819, he wrote thus to John Bright
“ For myself I can't help thinking that everything has
got to be done for Ireland. Hitherto the sole reliance
has bean on bayonets and patching. The feudal system
presses upon that country in a way which, as a rule
only foreigners can understand, for we have an in’
grained feudal spirit in our English character. I never
spoke to a French or Italian economist who did not at
once put his finger on the fact, that great masses of
landed property were held by the descendants of a con-
quering race who were living abroad, and thus in a
double manner perpetuating the remembrance of con-
quest and oppression, whilst the natives were at the
same time precluded from possessing themselves of
landed property and thus becoming interested in the
peace of the country. This was always pointed out to
me as the prune obstacle to improvement. How we are
to get out of this dilemma with the present House of
Commons, and our representative system as it is, is the
problem. For we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that
our law, or rather custom, of primogeniture, has its
roots in the prejudices of the upper portion of the
middle class as well as in the privileges of the aristo-
cracy. The snobbishness of the moneyed classes in the
great seats of commerce and manafactures is a
fearful obstacle to anv effectual change of the
system.” (Sydney Morning Herald please note)
And we may just conclude with another extract, not
from Mr Cobden himself, but from his English bio-
grapher, a Liberal in this matter after our own heart;
** Tbe misery of the winter in Ireland had produced its
natural fruits in disorder and violence. The Ministry
resorted tor the eighteenth timff since the Lnion to
the stale device cf a Coercion Bill, that stereotyped
avowal—and always made, strange to say, without
shame or contrition—of the secular neglect and ino*m-
petency of the English Government of Ireland. Two
serious inconveniences followed. The first waa that the
Irish members, led by O'Connell, persistently opposed
by all the means in their power every step of this
violent and shallow policy. It would have been ignoble
if they baa dene less. But their just and laudable ob-
struotion of the Coercion Bill interposed dangerous
delays in the way of the Corn Bill.”
t This wis in 1843 We are now in 1883, and still
clinging to what Mr. Morley truly terms this violent
and shallow polioy,” which is ardently eulogized even
in this free colony bv the snobbish organs of the
moneyed classes.—i'n B.

Austin Dobson, the poet, like our own Sladen,
does not always shine. His ballad “ The Ladies of St.
James’s" in Harper’s (old style) t is not brilliant.
Here is a little of it:—
"The ladies of St, James's
Wear satin on their backs;
They sit all night at Ombre,
With candles all of wax [111]:
Bat Phyllida, my Phyllida I
She dons her russet gown.
And runs to gather May dew
Before the world is down.”
■’ With candles all of wax,” is sad stuff. Yet Austin
Dobson is the next poet, they seem to think, to Brown-
ing, and will almost to a certainty be created, at some
future time, poet-lanreate. So, cheer up, Mr. Professor
Sladen. Persevere. They can’t m ike you poet-laureate
of England, it is true. But one will venture to wager
that if you publish much more poetry in a paper
any one reads, you will be given the refusal of the
laureateship of a ham-and-beet shop.
And so Mr. Brough Smyth—his name, by the
way, used to be Robert Smith, and he was a drayman—
has been appointed Curator of the Sandhurst School of
Mines. This is the man who when permanent Secre-
tary for Mines, in Victoria, was brought before a board
of inquiry, charged with continuous tyranny to his
subordinates, in consequence of which, according to
the evidence, one man of feeble and nervous constitu-
tion was actually worried to death. The charges of
tyranny were absolutely true and proved to the hilt,
yet Smyth, instead of being dismissed, had interest
enough to gain permission to resign. His opportunities
for exercising his tyranny were very great. The
colonies were at their heaviest depression when Smyth
was at the height of his frenzy. Employment of any
kind was soatoely obtainable. The streets were full of
educated men, who couldn’t get bread and butter. To
lose a berth involved starvation. Smyth was moreover
a man of extraordinary ability. Successive Ministers were
mere wax in his hands. He managed to overcome anta-
gonists nearly as strongly situated as himself. Christo-
pherson, Engineer-in-Chief of the Victorian Water
Supply, fought against his overbearing disposition long,
but had at last to suoonmb, and to find his department
reduced to a sort of appanage of the Mines, and him-
self brought to the necessity of doing much of his
business with the Minister through Smyth himself,
who used to keep him cooling his heels, portfolio in
hand, in the lobby of the office of Mines, till it suited
his convenience to grant him an audience. The way
Smyth managed to heap insults on people, while, as he
reckoned, keeping himself perfectly safe, was well ex-
amplified in the way he managed with Christopherson.
He used to admit him promptly enough when he had no
excuse for excluding him. But it was when a member,
or several members of Parliament were with him or
waiting their turn that ho would let Christopherson
sweat in the lobby. Thus if the Chief Engineer brought
his conduct before the Minister's notice, be had a sore
excuse, and two or three members certain to back him
up. Besides this artfulness, his industry and his
organising faculty were immense. He worked like a
slave himself, and brought to hie work talents of no
mean order. His mere clerks were not alone intimidated
by his unvarying victories over men much better
placed tor resisting him, but they were conscious that
he was capable of overmatching and outwitting them at
every turn. He was their master in every sense, and
when opposed had neither pity nor scruple. His power
of sarcasm was something tremendous. He had the
art of saying the most stinging things, and it is a fact
that although the men in his office ware a very fair
average lot so far as spirit, and more than an average
lot as regards efficiency, he had so mastered them, teat
the greater number actually trembled in his presence.
Much of Smyth’s power over these men was due to the
fact that he habitually kept his regular gazetted staff
of officers, who were entitled to the benefits and protec-
tion of the Civil Service Asst, at a minimum, and filled
every possible post with “supernumeraries," that is to
say men supposed to bo temporarily engaged for tran-
sient employment, and liable to have their services dis-
pensed with at any moment, without appeal.

The Jack Sprat and Loiterer case, iu th Wo-
donga Handicap, has not yet been settled. It will be
resollacted that tha former came in first, but the
stewards paid the stakes to the second horse for an
alleged mis-nomlnatlon. The matter was then taken
into Court by Sprat’a owner, and the defendants have
now caused the case to ba put off for another three
months.
In summing up the merits of the competitors in
the Grafton handicap sculling race, “ Kerens,” ot the
Melbourne Sportsman, says: “ Beach is rather too big
to be a wonder in a wager-boat—men of his stamp
exhaust themselves through their superabundant
strength." In the ordinary coarse of things “ Nerous "
should have gone for Beach, Moat people do when they
are out of their depth.
The draw for the Handicap Sculling Race on
the Clarence resulted as follows 1st division—Beach,
N. M'Donald, Largan, and Baker. 2ad— frickctt, D.
M Donald, Perkins, Messenger, and Campbell. Beach,
who has been trained by Kelly, is, as usual, in first-
class condition, and shonld Wiggins prove a false
prophet, the South Coast man, who doesn’t take kindly
to lumpy water, should pull off the event.
The wrestling match between Aoton, the Fng-
ish champion, and Whistler, the American champion,
at New York, January 4, for £500, resulted in a draw.
The American, who had double Acton's brute force, but
little soienoe, kept on all fours throughout the contest
—afraid to stand up; and the rules of the contest
allowing this, nothing whatever resulted. The Ameri-
can came in for a great deil of abuse from his ewn
people.
The long-talked-of fight between two pugs, of
the second magnitude came off in town, on Saturday
night. The encounter lasted upwards of two hoars.
Both men showed signs ot severe punishment, and were
very much marked about the body, owing to the heavy
falls on the floor. A much sharper affair took place at
Annandale, this week, when one of the combatants was
" knocked out ” in something like 15 minutes of heavy
fighting.
The Melbourne C.C. are receiving scurvy treat-
ment at the hands of the disbanded Australian Eleven.
The Club was the means, indirectly, of putting into the
pookets of these money-grubbers almost an equal
amount to that which they made all through tbeir
English tour, and now, because they are “ not in the
swim," they discover business engagements will pre-
vent their playing. By the way, it would be interest-
ing to know what business some of there individuals
follow.
Ei. S. Fuller, the well-known Victorian builder,
has completed and sent to Sydney a four-oared clinker
gig, 40ft. long, with short ontriggsra fore and aft, so as
to give the same leverage all round. She has been built
far the Jesuit college, Lane Cove. Fuller has also re-
ceived an order to build the eight-oar for the Victorian
crew who will represent the oolorv on the Parramatta
on the 28th April. She will bo 57fc. long, and the
builder does not intend to have an ounce more wood in
her than is absolutely necessary. Thus The Austra-
lasian.
A hot and terribly severe hours’ battle re-
cently took place in Sharon, U.S , between a German
and a Swede. Both had seen severe military experience
in Europe, and were tough customers. They fought
till they couldn't see each other. Finally the German
got his left ear knocked clean off, and he replied with
such effect in two successive rounds th .6 the Swede
couldn't come to time. The referee decided in favour
of the former, bat the stakeholder wanted half-an-
hour’s spell, tha pair then to resume. A row ensned.
pistols and knives being freely used, and the crowd
broke up in disorder.
A sculling race, in clinker outriggers, in connec-
tion with the M.R C., came off at Lane Cove on Satur-
day afternoon, for a wager boat presented by Mr. Car-
penter, and a second prize ot a pair of sculls given by
Mr. Fletcher, Course, about two miles. 1st heat,
Seale, Pickering, and Berchall. Pickering took the
lead, but Scale passed him at Longueville Wharf and
won easily. Berchall was never injthe race. 2nd heat,
between R. N. Bull and Fester, was won easily by the
former. Final—Bull and Seale. Bull drew away at the
start and led to Longueville, where Seale spurted,
passed his opponent, and finished an easy winner.

The 514-footer Lizzie has about the longast re-
cord of any of the open boats in the harbour, she won
her maiden race at Botany Regatta, in 1878. In 1877,
at the Anniversary Regatta, she won the Amateur
Race, and came in second for the Professional; she
also won at Snail's Bay. In 1878, the came in second at
both Woolloomooloo and North Shore. In 1879, she
won at Anniversary. Woolloomooloo, and Vernon
Regattas. In 1880, she scored second at the Anniver-
sary Regatta. In 1881, she won at the Anniversary
Regatta, and the SA.S.C. Commodore's trophy; and
in 1883, she came in second at the Anniversary Regatta.
Mr. Johnson has won over £151 worth of trophies with
the Lizzie.
Mr. W. L. Murdoch is, says the Cootamundra
Herald, about to return to Cootamundra and settle
down to business. A good job, too. If orioket didn’t
pay better the second trip that the first, it’s about time
William resumed his profession of a gentleman by act
of Parliament, and gave the gate-money racket best.
But we don’t care what he does. We consider him a
bore. We wish him well, and if ho don’t care about
Cootamundra, we wish him at the Carribees. We have
had about two years of Mnrdoohian pars, and we are
really Jack.” We shall be told what course of life Mr.
Spofforth proposes to pursue next, wo suppose, or to
what Mr, Alexander Bannerman contemplates devoting
his brains. The intelligence might, it is true, enthral
the upper crust. Bat we, being only tho common herd,
don’t care about it a bit. We should be glad to accept
from any of these gentlemen, however, his definition of
a professional cricketer Murdoch can do it if he likes.
We’ll put it into English.
FAREWELL,
Farewell, John Tait, farewell, old fellow.
Farewell the brave old “ black and yellow."
Good heart, free hand, cool, steady brain,
When shall we see your like again ?
When see again a struggle great
As that when dashing down the “ straight"
Year jockey brought The Barb—no boasi—
Lika lightning past the winning-post ?
When hear such cheers as skyward sprang
When every throat at Randwick rang
As he came onb the victor ? Well,
These things are past, and so, farewell.
One thing all man may safely say
Of yon, uncommon nowaday.
Yon never played a paltry ruse.
And never ran a horse to lose.
Thus the Cincinnati (U.S.) Commercial
“Clay Culbertson, Jerry Kiersted, Alexander Star-
buck, and E. G. Webster entered into a game of whist
After the first hand had been played, Webster, whose
deal it was, took the cards, shuffled them, and after
they had been out by Kiersted, dealt. Each player
then appeared to be unusually excited. Culbertson,
whoso turn it was to play, and who generally is very
prompt, delayed the play until Starbuok exclaimed,
' Gentlemen, I hare the most remarkable whist hand 1
ever held. I hold 13 hearts.' * And I,* remarked Cal.
berteon, ‘hold an equally remarkable hand. I have 13
spades.' ‘And I,’ nervously said Kiersted, ‘have 13
diamonds.’ ‘ Of oonrse. 1 hold the 13 trumps,’ quickly
chimed in the dealer. 1*0 say the players were unduly
excited at suoh an expose of the hands but feebly ex-
pressed their mental condition at the time. Ho one
had over heard of holding suoh hands in whist. A case
occurred in a B ■>aton club a year or so ago, where a
player held the 13 trumps, and also a similar case in a
New York dab, but aside from these two, no one could
report even saoh hands as these."
Abe Hioken and Professor Miller are not cousins.
Miller has published the following letter m the Mel-
bourne Sportsman Sib,— Some nights ago Mr. Abe
Hioken and myself had a few words over a statement I
had made that I was willing to hox any man in Australia
for a substantial sum. Hioken on that oooassion also
remarked that I had no necessity to go to America to
meet Sulivan, as there was a man in the colony who
ceuld accommodate me. The whole affair was born of
the excitement of the moment, and I therefore thought
no more of it. During the last few days. However, to
my astonishment, I have been met on several sides with
the news that Hioken has, in his own bar and in the
presence of numbers of people, expressed himself ready
to box me at any time, and for any amount. Now, Sir, I
don t suppose for one moment that Mr. Hicken really
wishes to meet me, and I merely set his *‘ bounce"
down to desire for a little cheap advertising and
self-glorification. If this theory be correct (and I sin-
cerely tru -1 it is—for Mr. Hioken's sake), well and
good; if not, he has only to whisner the fact to have me
instantly at his elbow with a sufficient deposit to ensure
a match on any terms.—Yours, &o , Wm. Miller.
A most exciting contest took plaoe at Largs on
Saturday week between George Saxton of Woodville,
and John Hynds of West Maitland The match was
for £20 aside, and eventuated at Wtlngarmer’s wine
Largs The agony was announced to commence
at 3 o clock, but owing to a slight dispute which arose
in consequence of the display of an orange flag by one
of Sexton’s backers, a short delay occurred. The
betting was a little in favour of Hynds, who held the
ohumpiouship of the Newcastle district as ‘‘porridge
stutter ” for a long period. Sexton’s backers were how.
ever very confident, as he had shown good form in train*
ing, and was carefully brought out by Bully Poarse.
Hynds was coached by Tim Hyau, an old and experienced
porridge eater. At precisely twenty-minutes past three
the ‘‘hominy’’ was placed on the table, and the
struggle commenced, in the presence of nearly 400
spectators. Sexton displayed some signs of nervous-
ness, but after the first quart had been negotiated his
hand became steadier, and the spoon was lifted neatly
and with a dash that to some extent soared Hynd's
backers. Hynds however took matters very coolly and
rolled into his second quart with avidity. It now be-
came evident that a close struggle would take plaoe, and
the wagering became very brisk, amidst loud cries of
“ Go it, George," "Stick to it Jack, don’t give the hair
on your teeth time to grow," &c., &3, Both men now
settled down to their work gamely, but on commencing
the fifth quart. Saxton began to hold out signals of
distress. Hynd still plodded on, and was soon a quart
ahead of his antagonist, who hold on for a few more
spoonfuls, when he was compelled to give in. Hynde
was enthusiastically cheered, and wae afterwards
carried out on the shoulders of some of his admirers,
who however, dropped him rather suddenly when he
began to show signs of nausea. It is stated that an-
other match is likely to be made between the two men,
as some of Sexton’s backers are not satisfied that he
was beaten on his merits. They allege that, owing to his
nervousness at the start, a spoonful ‘‘went the wrong
way," and put him off a bit.

A tale cotres np from the far sou’-wast.
Four honored miles away,
Or a wealthy wool-king who could not rest
Till ha married a lady gay.
It’s a tala of a thing that sometimes occurs —
Of Love getting lively at seventy years.
Now, over the world this truth's contest,
Since giddy old Solomon’s day.
That on sweeter pillow than maiden’s breast
Maa n-.>ver his Head could lay.
Duo a nealthy girl, as a rule, prefers
a head uaWhitened by seventy years.
Ah ! love, wo fear, is a sorry jest
When tUe lover is more than grey,
‘But the pretty young wife can be richly drost.
And the old man’s wealth can pay.
Is it luoro, or love, the passion that stirs,
When a maiden g.ts married to—seve -.ty years ?

The little Vernon Band was very popular in the
Gardens last Thursday, and played seven pieces on the
lawn, whore a (air crowd had gathered. As usual, a
miuioer of unintelligent people closed round in a douse
wall that shut out all air, and glared at the boys boor-
ishly. A mustard-coloured homespun was rather good
pu a young lady; and two black cashmeres, with
do able-breast ad tops, and pleated skirts tr.mmed with
orapa and laoo, were quite stylish. But with these
exceptions, elderly ladies wore the best dresses, and
they were aery few.

A North Queensland paper says servants are
not to be got lor love or money. The plan of appealing
to the domestic “slavey” by ottering her “love”
would probably bo as futile in North Queensland as any.
where else. Unless the love came from some outside
source, brought in the butcher’s tray, for instance,
Mariar would certainly scorn the offer. However, when
fabulous offers of pecuniary remuneration fail, the
Northern mistresses are fortunately able to fall back
on kanakas. Tneso are now being largely engaged, and
employers say they are quiet, civil, and capable of
doing fair w : rk.

To commemorate their eldest son’s attainment
Of his majority, Mr. and Mrs. John Hardie, of Darling-
burst, gave a ball on Friday. It was a large ball, con-
taining about 150 people—rather nice people. The
municipal element was strongly represented amongst
gentlemen j and the ladies, so far as we recollect, were
all handsome; and they attired themselves in all that
splendour of diversified colour and fascinating fit so
surely calculated to thrill the male heart to its inner-
most recesses. Mrs. Hardie wore a magnificent blue
trained satin, the front skirt one iridescent mass of
flashing beetles’ wings; Mrs. Alfred Bennett, a light
pompadour silk trimmed with pink; Mrs. C. J. Boberts,
a splendid white satin and lace, with a train; Mrs.
Taylor, of Balmain, black satin edged with mossy silver
fringe, and light blue broohf) tablior; Mrs. Samuel
Hordern, a creamy pompadour that looked well gar-
landed with flowers; Mrs. John Davies, a deep crimson
velvet robe of exceeding richness, the skirt being of
gold satin and lace to match. Miss Linda Fitz-dtubbs
wore a quaint costume, with asuggestion of the antique
about it: croam nun’s cloth, simply shaped, the arms,
neck, tabs on skirt and round the tunic all edged with
gold; the hair drawn on to the crown of the he»d.
About midnight a general adjournment was made to the
refreshment-room, where Mr. John See, M.P., proposed
mo health of Mr. John Hardie, junior, whom he highly
rejommended to the special consideration of other
follows' sisters, and, whan his health was drunk with
cheers, a special volley was added for 41 the young lady
in prospect." At this several charming girls seemed to
look very conscious. But, perhaps it was only fancy.
Mr. John, juur., replied briefly: As the postscript to
the previous toast no doubt reminded him that there
mignt be several of those “ in prospect" present, he
was in a delicate position, to maintained a diplomatic
reticence rather thau commit himself. Mr. Hezlet
toasted the parents, and said that during a quarter of
a century's friendship with Mr. Hardie, senior, he
44 never found kink or crook in his character.” Mr.
Teoce was called for to propose the 44 Ladies," and
dancing was then continued. The affair took place in
Nithsdale rooms, which wore embellished in honour of
tno event, and tue musio of ths band provided by Mr.
Jfirnest Need a was praised by all the dancers. A cham-
pagne supper, more than usually nice, by the City Cater-
mg Co., was spread iu the long room, and, in fact,
everything required to make the ball complete and
pleasant wan carefully attended to.

A very enjoyable dance was given by Mr. and
Mrs. W. M. Jackson, Moore Bark, last Wednesday
week, to celebrate a daughter’s birthday. The rooms
were gay, and the daughters, and visitors from Manly

Piuk and white predominated iu the dresses, and ou the

of the evening. The dancing was lively till ever so late.

is passed on the trip, and the is fall of

other toasts, sports, exploration, and so ou, the party

The Ball given at the School of Arts, at Murru-
ruudi, on Tuesday evening last, by four Queensland
bachelors, was a grand success in every sense. Supper
Al, decorations capital, music excellent. Visitors Tom
Tamwortb, Maitland, Morpetu, Uuunedab, Singleton
and the surrounding district—to the number of about
eighty. A lady from a large estate near Morpeth wore
oue of the bauds)meat dresics—of peach satin, almost
covered with white pearl beaded laoe. A stately dark
lady sailed about in oream satin brooade. trimmad with
blue satin trimmings. Several dresses of pale olue and
pink looked pretty on their fair and dark haired wearers.
A little local belle looked piquant iu pale pink and wide
cream laoe collar falling over her suapeiy shoulders,
cardinal bow in her hair; and a local married lady, in
cardinal and cream, received much utt utiou. A mar-
ried lady, from Tamwortb, as usual, was full of anima-
tion, and looked well; while a young widow, from the
same place, was much sought after. A sister-in-law of
one ot the bachelor hosts looked killing, and had a host
of attendants. The newly married PM, of Maitland,
and h.a brilliant bride, were present, and attracted at-
tention. Dancing was kept up vigorously until about
four o’clock, aud a most enjoyable evening was spent.
Belle not distinguishable amongst so many claimants
tor the honour. Healths ot the douors of the enter-
tainment drunk iu bumpers of champagne before part-
ing, and suitably replied to by the youngest of the
number.

Maitland. Bride, Miss Solomon, wore a travelling
areas—fawn surah satin trimmed with cream laoe,
cream hat and feather. Two bridesmaids, in mauve
sateen and cream lace, with hats to match. The wed-
ding was under the auspices of Hon. John Kales, and
bride was given away by her brother. Among the cos-
turns* of the guests, a black corded satin and surah
trimmed with blaok Spanish lace, white straw hat and
feather ; a grey silk ; prune dress and oream bonnet;
dark green silk and princess bonnet (Mrs. T. K Abbott);
light silk and handsome laoe mantle, were conspicuous.
Church decorated with floral arches ; wedding very

Where is Lot?
Plain English—continued.
The pure city of Bathurst is largely under the influ.
ence of white chokerism. When The Bulletin release
fund was started, the Holy Joeys declined to attend a
meeting or subscribe, on the ground that to do either
one or the other would be an endorsement of The Bul-
letin’s contention, that shocking immorality ex's’ed
at Clontarf. The Bathurst snufllebustora wouldn’t
have it that any British community could revel in sin.
Let us see what has just come out about that white-
washed sepulchre of the plains—Bathurst, “ The
evidence on the Are at Mr. Wray's house disclosed
gross immorality. The house was in charge of a
woman named Bradley, with five children, audit was
shown to have been the resort of larrikins.
Weight, watchman at Bathurst Hospital, first saw the
fire, bub could not rouse the inmates. He burst open
the door, and found a woman in bed with a man and
four children. A young ijirl of thirteen years was also dis-
discovered sleeping between two youths eighteen years
of ago. But for Wright’s exertions, the ten inmates
would have been burnt to death or suffocated " Now,
supposing The Bulletin had been on the saob, aud
asked who was Mr. W ray, and did ho know to what
use his house was put—suppose The Bulletin had
peered into the twenty or thirty festering centres of
filth and vice which may oven now bo found within a
stone.throw of the Bathurst churches—and, as with
Clontarf, just told what it saw—and an adverse libel
verdict were returned —would the H ly Joeys of
Bathurst have coma oat of their whitewashed sepul-
chres, and with their coin say, “This is true I” Not
they. Their holy eyeballs cast on Paradise would have
been at another angle. Baht Bathurst gospel-gricds
for the whole world. The howlers there have bigger
mouths than our own park-howlers, and their white
chokers would tent an array. From the gallows in
Bathurst gaol, you can throw a stone to the roofs of
six churches ; and from each church you can heave a
biscuit and hit a brothel. Next week there’s to be a big
meeting to subscribe funds for the heathen mission in
the South Seas—while under the eaves of their
churches the howlers allow poor childr.n to wither
in filth, vice, aud shame 1
Circumcising the Law.
In the Moot, v. Moore assault case, at Melbourne, no
less than six Jewish magistrates were on the bench —no !
doubt to see “ fair play.” Which side pent for these
“beaks” does not appear. But wc know. Poor Marcus
Clarke, just before he died, wrote ns a letter, in which
he remarked that in Melbourne whenever a poor
devil disputed a pawnbroker’s account for a pledged
waistcoat the Bench looked like Pelican Island in the
breeding season, by reason of the multitude of beaks
hanging over the railing. Last week when Joske and
Co. were persecuted at Melbourne for selling inferior
brandy in casks bearing Mar tell’s'brand they came into
court and said that the olfencef had been “inadver-
tently” committed, and that' “ it had been arranged be-
tween them and the ‘Cuthtoms’ that they should pay
* fifty-thevon poundth cosths,’ which included the price
of the seized brandy" After consultation, it was
announced that a majority of the bench arrived at a
decision—from which Mr. Pantou, P.M., dissented—to
impose a fine of £21, with £57 10s. costs. Of course it
was the P.M. who dissented. At Melbourne they
still have our eld cnst-off system of members of secret
societies hearing the causes of their brstbren, and
nodding at them from the bench—of members of Par-
liament going round to “see justice done” to their
constituents; of smug magisterial deacons doing a
“good turn” for members of their churches ; of shixty
per shenters clinching from the bench the bargains of
their fellow-uanrers; of tradesmen giving verdicts in
favour of other tradesmen. We congratulate Mel-
bourne on the result of the Joske case. When we see
that the “ Police Magistrate dissented," wo always give
a long whistle.

The other day the wife of a tradesman died in a
well-known town on the Hunter She was a woman
whose history was never in this country told by her
own tongue. Forty-two years ago she informed upon
and brought to the gallows her undo and three cousins,
in whose home she had been reared and fed These
men, who were (armors in the West of Ireland, were
evicted from their land, and resolved to clear the
country and go to America Before starting they mace
a bonfire of the landlord's barn. They never went to
America in consequence. The woman got £200 and a
passage to Australia.
The Supreme Court Judges have decided by a
majority, Mr, Windeyer dissenting, that an action for
breach of promise of marriage can’t be brought against
a man’s executors after the .Lothario himself is dead.
This decision is apparently based on the fact that the
corpse can’t square the action by offering to marry the
plaintiff, and pay all costs, and provide her with con-
venient accommodation in kis coffin, and apparel suit-
able to his condition of—death. Therefore, sue the gay
deceivers while they live, darlings Sinee this decision
there’s as little money as there over has been satisfac-
tion to be got out of a corpse. A oadavro can’t come
round to the witnesses’ and say pathetically
" Juliar, can yon forgive me ?’*
Whenever we are sad at heart, when the moon
looks like a bad shilling and the noonday like a brass
cofflu-plate; when beer is as cod-liver oil is the month,
and all the glory seems to have gone suddenly from
life, then we turn to the storied page of the ’i own and
Country, and find solace for our sorrow in the grass-
hopper chirpings of the gentle " Gipsy.” The oracles
may be dumb, but this sweet sibyl twitters continually
in her own little tuft of metaphorical spear-grass in the
corner of Alfred’s oolamns. It does us good when we
feel sour and cynical to turn to this page and wander
through baby questions and infantile answers about the
right shades of ribbon to weir with certain colours cf
dress, ana the exact style of bow to make at different
stages of acquaintance. We feel as we read that there
is still some innocence, still some guileless simplicity,
left in the world. But when the charming creature
leaves the region of ribbons and flounces to express
opinions upon such an abstract matter as literature, wo
begin to think her just a little bit of a bore, ffe don’t
care for blue-stockings—on paper And when she
gravely informs a panting inquirer that the lines—
“ 0 for the touch of a vanquished hand
Aad the sound of a voice that is gone,”—
are taken from a poem of Tennyson, we have to come
to the sad conclusion that she is mortal and erring like
the rest of us, and that even her opinions upon ribbons
may not be altogether free from human frailty. Some-
times, we are ashaaed to say, wo have almost gone so
far as to suspect that there were little trifles of eti-
quette which she might not have at her taper finger-
ends. W e should be sorry if these suspicions had any
foundation in fact. We have very few idols left tow.
Here is a little ode for ** Gipsy’’ to out out and paste in
her album, with our compliments
O Gipsy dear I
You are not very droll or wise.
We don’t know much about your eyes.
And yet we love you—which is queer—
O Gipsy dear I
We love you for your lack of guile,
We love your literary style.
Your cheerful chirp wo love to hear,
U Gipsy dear I
O Gipsy dear!
We love your chat of capes and cloaks.
We love your little toddling jokes.
They are fun, now—don't think we sneer,
O Gipsy dear I
But when you soar above such things,
Upon your little muslin wings,
You are the very smallest beer,
O Gipsy dear 1

testimony in its FAVOUR.
ADVANTAGES:

surface, retains the neoeasary FLEXIBILITY, receives
the STRAIN OF WEAE, preventing bones in the
corset from BEEAKINQ, and avoids the uncomfortable
and injurious pressure on the HIP BONE caused by
the old straight steels. The BACK POETION of these
stays is COMPOSED of WHALEBONE—NOT STEEL.

THE ACME COESET
is CON8TEUCTBD on a GBACEFUL MODEL, suit-
able for the present style of dress, the shape being PEE-
MANENTLY EETAINED by a series of NAEEOiV
WHALEBONE placed diagonally across the front,
gradually curving in and contracting the corset at the
bottom of the busk, whereby the bIZE of the FIQURbi
is REDUCED, the outline improved, a permanent sup.
port afforded, and a fashionable and ELEGANT AP-
PEAEANCE secured.
