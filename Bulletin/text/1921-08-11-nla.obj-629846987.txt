The Iliad
The world of which Ilomer wrote might
be called “The World of the 'Robber-Kings.”
Its chief were Cnossos in Crete,
Mycenae and Tiryns in Greece, and lastly
Troy itself. These were plunder-cities, which
lived either by taxing— -i.e., robbing—the
passer-by, or by sheer pi nicy. For instance,
if you wanted to take a cargo from the
Mediterranean to the s ßlack Sea yoiv could
not row your boat up the Hellespont (alas,
we know it too well’-as the Dardanelles!)
because of the strong-current which caused
us so much sorrow: you haci to unload the
bales on the southern .shore of the isthmus
and carry them on tinkling mules to the
northern; passing undcb the walls of Troy
you had to pay toll to King Priam, to whom
his misfortunes and the supreme art of
Homer have caused the world to be much
more respectful than he probably deserved.
The iEgean civilisation of from, roughly, 2000-
TTOO KC. was a light-lieartcd thing, with
dancing-girls, acrobats, boxers—apparently
not all male either —bullfights, f snake-god-
desses, huge masonry and a very remarkable
pictorial art, which might'have outrivalled
Greek art itself had it been left alone. The
■people were probably much the same sort of
people as inhabit the Mediterranean lands
to this day; and the best thing they did was
to invent a very modern system of domestic
water-sewerage, which was better than any-
thing ever used again by anybody till the
nineteenth century. Perhaps I should have
said "the best thing next to the invention of
writing,” for in Crete they did invent a
sort of script which we cannot yet Tend,
though no doubt that invention was not en-
tirely original. If we could read that script
s possibly the problem of Homer would be
‘ -solved We get glimpses of that old civilisa-
tion in many of the most ancient myths,
such as Theseus anil the Minotaur* the Gor-
; gon, the Centaurs, Ariadne and dozens more;
‘ possibly the robber-king of Cnossos d d exact
a maiden-tribute from Athens, and possibly
that was whv he lost his city; possibly the
men of the sen did see horsemen in Asia
Minor, and called the monsters Centaurs;
Andromeda may possibly be a reminiscence
oi piracy. Certainly we get the impression
•hat there must have been a good deal that
: was childlike and romantic in that dead old
world.
i The end came when the Dorians swept
S down through Greece from somewhere in
l Central Europe. It took a long time, and
several Invasions, to destroy the old world,
i whose roots were firmly planted in flic
; islands, and the Iliad describes only four
days of the fighting which ultimately settled
"the fate of the last and strongest of the
robber-kings. It is impossible to say how
much of the poem is historical; the most we
can say is that if things did not happen
« exactly as Homer says, at all events he tells
us how he thought they happened. If a man
named Achilles did not drag with horses the
body of a man named Hector round the
walls of Troy, somebody else probably did;
/ and Leaf in his book “Troy: A Study in
Homeric Geography” (MacMillan) thinks he
has identified some,of the features described
by Ilomer. The coincidences are very re-
markable, and it is difficult not to believe that
Homer knew what ho was writing about.
After Troy fell the world remained in the
.greatest poverty and misery for many cen-
turies, while the invaders intermingled with
•the people of the ancient civilisation; and
the old race, slowly returning to type, as
graces do, produced the modern “Dago,” who
■has probably always been the true type of
Mediterranean man. Every little tribe kept
! up its own glorious memories bv a bard,
who, to the accompaniment of a lyre,’
howled on the beach in much the same sort
of Oriental cadence as so many of ns heard
in Egypt. This scrubby old man, with
fierce eyes and untidv beard, was probably
a real poet, intensely proud of the term
“sons of Homer,” which was already applied
to the bards, and looking upon his tribal
lay as the most sacred thing in the world.
If the bard wanted any supper it would
never do to relate the misdeeds of the tribal
hero; so whenever he had to tell about
some peculiarly dirty trick he would have
to attribute it to some god, usually the god
of the silly fellows in the next island; and
that is why the Iliad thinks so much more
of its men than of its gods.
Just before the historical period one- —01
several —\rery gn>at poets arose, who col
la tod some of the lays, editing them to suit
their present needs ; and this—or these—was
our “Homer.” Something of the kind must
have happened. Everything goes to show
that the original “Homeros” was a super-
natural “father of Bards,”, as JEsculapius
was a supernatural “father of doctors”;
and there are two distinct types of civilisa-
tion in the Iliad, an archaic and a historic, a
bronze and an iron. Some of the heroes
use the great leather “tower-shields” of the
old civilisation; others are simply historical
Greek hopKtes. Possibly tin; original lays
wore not written in lonian Greek at all, but
were rendered into that dialect by the name-
less poet who is—or are —known to us as
“Homer.”
But whoever Homer was there can be no
doubt that he was a very grefK poet and a
supreme storyteller, who wrote about
battles that occurred almost within sight of
our own battles at Gallipoli. If anyone
wishes to prove for himself that he was a
very great poet—as one might say prove that
the sun is warm—let him take some good
translation, such as “Lang, Leaf and
Myers’,” which is Homer done into the
knightly prose of Lord Berners, and I shall
be very much surprised if he does not agree
With the consensus‘of mankind that Homer
is only excelled by Shakspeare. Where shall
one find a finer fellow than Hector, or a more
delielitful woman than Andromache? Where
shall one find a story told more vividly, with
fiercer intensity of imagination? And where
more dainty beauty of description?
C. M. L.
Young Men and Old Women
Old women as characters in fiction or on
the stage present a constant paradox. The
keenest observers, the most trustworthy de-
lineators, the most humorous impersonators
of old women are invariably young men;
and very able young men at that. If a
novelist considers it worth while to draw old
women, and probably to paint their little
ways, it is a Sign that he is in front of the
ruck of his proressioir. Should he bo that
way inclined he will show his quality in his
early novels and gradually work his old
women out of his system, so to speak.
Elderly fiction-writers prefer, to depict youth
and beauty. To the young observer’s mas-
culine idea old women appear as either
humorous dr pathetic; or, if the observer has
just that extra touch of penetration which
may be genius, he may see his "subject” in
a kind of detached setting, which admits of
the play of irony, but a very delicate, kind-
hearted ■ irony. All the laughs he gets are
genial and not mere guffaws.
Barry Lupiuo, Edwin Brett, Neil Ken-
yon, Harry Phydora—good “dames” all,
past and present —-would agree that there is
no surer way of raising a laugh than for
the dame, arrayed in all her girlish piquancy,
to advance to the footlights and gush across
to the audience, “Oh, girls, let. me tell you
all about my first husband !” That is ele-
mentary humor arising from the fact that
youth can always see the absurdity of age
if it is masquerading as youth. It is pro-
bably because this is -the first thing that
strikes an ordinary young man that so many
of the great old women of English litera-
ture are introduced merely as, foils to the
younger characters or are concerned with
their loves and adventures. But when a
great mind gets to work on even such humble
material as a devoted old nurse or a disre-
putable old landlady, the nurse and the land-
lady refuse to be just fill-up parts? They
become human beings, about whom their
author is saying to himself, “How queer
you are! Why are old women so remote and
sq pathetic?”
Modelm young men who write novels to
sell do not trouble much about any woman
too old to be a vamp. The word is slang,
but then it is the only word to descr.be
Lady Barbara Neave and her congeners, for
they have a determination of slang to the
soul. Advance, Compton Mackenzie, as the
brilliant exception! Mrs. Gowndry, Mrs,
Gainsborough and various other delight-
fully-drawn characters rise from the pages
of “Sylvia Scarlett” and “Sylvia and
Michael,” and we greet them as well and
truly drawn. Mackenzie is a kind of
minor Dickens in the way he differentiates
Ins landladies. Thev are all alike, all true
to type* and yet all individual and different.
Sylvia’s English landlady in Petrograd, who
was the widow of , a Frenchman, and whose
sons were Russians and never could be sorted
out into their proper nationality to join
up with their right regiments, is a living
character. Even in the slight “Vanity
Girl” two theatrical landladies, mere
sketches, show the inherent difference
between the hard coldness of the old Lon-
doner and the warmheartedness of the Scot-
tish type. The humor is real and unforced.
But Mrs. Grudden was there, first of all, to
point the way in which aspiring young men
who wish to describe funny theatrical old
women should go. Mrs. Grudden was beheld
by the mind’s eye of Dickens when he was a
young man, and she fascinated him. Pie
noted her in every group at the Crummies
theatre; he was conscious of her dress, “tile
brown cloth pelisse and the beaver bonnet” ;
he knew what she was doing and wliat she
had to eat. He was as much interested in
her as he was in Sairey Gamp or in Mrs.
Nicldeby or in Mr. F.’s Aunt or in Mrs.
Ividgerbury or “Fiery Face” or any of his
immortal charwomen. They are not brought
in only to be funny. They are vitally im-
portant.
“Grande dame” characters in fiction do not
appeal as humorous old women do. Thack-
eray provides one exception. Mdme. de Florae
fin “The Newcomes”) can never be remem-
bered without a twist of the heart for the
poignant quality of her constancy, expressed
in her lovely letter to Col. Newcome. The
' i-oneli idiom of it makes it grip the harder.
Tears alone express its effect on the reader
even if it is known by heart. (Thackeray,
however, considered himself an old man when
he wrote “The Newcomes.”) The most
beautiful trbute ever penned by a voung
man to, an old woman was writen by Keats.
It is the penultimate line of the first, verse
of “Meg Merrilees.” “Her wine was dew
of the wild white rose,” he says. He can
afford to throw away a line like that on a
somewhat crazy srpsy hag. The half
humqrous, half-wistful tenderness with which
he treats Meg. his admiration for her in-
domitable spirit, culminate in the glorious,
shining, diamond-like clarity of the vowel-
sound in “wine” and “white” and “wild,”
and not a two-syllabled word in the line!
“Tbce you are. madam”—did he say to
himself? —“one of the most magical lines in
the language, and it's not too e-ood for you.”

The Unwanted Guest
■Japan and the California Problem, writ-
ten by T. Iyenaga, Ph.D., and K. Sato, M.A.,
both of the University of Chicago, and pub-
lished by Putnam’s, is an attempt to grapple
constructively with America’s biggest inter-
national question. And. at the same time,
with Japan’s biggest domestic one. Japan,
with 380 people to the square mile—or
nearly four times as manv as China carries
on a similar area: —has only quarter of an
acre of cultivable land per head of the
population. The Jap is a born farmer f and
farming in Japan is what the wine business
used to be in England—“a trade for gentle-
men.” However, social prejudices have to
take second place to the necessity of remain-
ing alive, even in Asiatic countries, and with
the Restoration the Japanese began to manu-
facture. “Generally speaking,” remark the
authors, “the industry of Japan, which was
established on a firm footing by the year
1900, has trebled during the last 20
years.” The export trade reached gigantic
dimens’"ons during the world-war, transform-
ing the nation from a debtor into a creditor.

The Song.
When joy was at full tide with me,
Why took you down your violin
And played the old and grievous air
My heart would fain have not let in?
It was too dolorous and fair,
Like a sad tale told artlessly!
From then delight in me was spent,
And I went haunted all the day
By tales of love indifferent grown,
And fear lest death should snatch away
My love, and I be left a10ne....
Your song did this! Are you content ?

The Hill.
The little trees went up the hill
In little leaves of brown ;
And there at the Spring's wdl
She made a daisy crown.
A crown for a boy’s head
That yet was young to know
The green word the wind said
When the grass bent low.
Up the hill and up the hill,
King Boy, on happy feet,
If I could go at the Spring’s will,
How far till we should meet?
Trees and trees and up they go
Till their leaves fall down;
ind it takes fifty years to know
The worth of a daisy crown.
Up the hill and down the hill —
But I have a heart of fear
If I should walk at the Spring’s will
Into the gate of the year,
That all the crying and sighing
Of autumn and winter and sin
Would come peering and prying
If the wind let me in.
The little trees go the hill
And every leaf is brave :
And a boy king at the Spring’s will
The, soul of a man may save.
Oh, I have the hearty that you wore
This day when grass grows green;
And the singing wind about the door
Knows naught of years between.
Up the hill or down the hill
Must two pairs of feet
Walk fast at the Spring’s will
To where dreams meet. .
O boy king! It’s up we go
And never down at all :
For I would know and you would know
Why the new winds call.

Girl of Mine.
Girl of mine, dear heart of me,
With what careless sorcery,
What bride-draught of magi an wine,
Eros sealed you wholly mine,
With what siren song Desire
Sang from out the primal mire,
Passion linked us long ago,
Know I not, nor crave to know '
Eyes that held a sombre stress,
Dark with haunting hopelessness;
Lips wherefrom the weary ruth
Of the years had stolen youth;
Laughter dim as whispering leaves
When the autumn twilight grieves
With the grieving winds that sigh
Down the incandescent sky—
These were mine and more than these.
Year and year, like shadowed seas,
Blind through darkness went and came;
Year and year like poppy-flame
Flow’red with dreams and faded pale
Where the mists of Aidenn veil;
Past the stillness of the stars
Sleeps eternal ocean bars.
Girl of mine, your tranquil eyes,
Lit with morning Heaven-wise,
Tell again the tale they told
Unto me in dawns of old!
And again like magian wine,
Eros’ bridal song divine
Flooding, stills in heart and brain
Time’s slow threnody of pain.
From the darkness of my days
I beheld you when life’s ways
Sundered, and on either hand,
As in vision, seemed to stand
Shapes implacable and twain
Darkening my divided brain,
Evermore entreating me:
“Choose, O fool, which thing shall be!”
Then it was the splendor shone
In your eyes I gazed upon,
Till, with a diviner sense,
Born of great love’s imminence,
Flaming out across the world,
Far as God’s white dawn is hurled,
Rose my dreams, clear-purposed, fair,
Victors o’er their own despair.
Girl of mine, ah, mate of me,
What immutable decree.
JEons since, from lips divine
Fallen, sealed you wholly mine!
Ah, what care? While Eros yet
Fires for mine your red mouth, set
Like a jewel flame in snow,
Know I not, nor care to know!

AFTER YOU!
The Washington correspondent of the New York Times reports that Mr. Roosevelt (Assistant Secretary for the Navy) in a speech said: “The limitation
of armaments will be the thought uppermost at the coming Limitation of Armament Conference, but we must never, under any circumstances, put our country
in a position where it would be unable to defend itself against anything and everything arising. Pacifists and muddle-headed idiots will shout for the United
States to set an example, but we must never disarm, and then wait for other armed nations to act.”

THE RICH COURT KALEIDOSCOPE.
It has often been prophesied that, given the
opportunity, the present Full Bench of the
High Court would interpret the Constitution
less narrowly than a majority of the Judges
did in the early days of Federation. The
reading of the Trade and Commerce clause
which overthrew the new Protection, reduced
the Federal Arbitration Court to an absurdity,
and, generally, made the Australian Parlia-
ment look anything but a sovereign legisla-
ture, was certainly never anticipated or de-
sired by a vast majority of those who voted
for union 20-odd years ago. Yet nearly all
of them were keen State -lighters. The
principle of sovereign States was far more
important in their eyes than the principle
of a sovereign State. That was perfectly
natural. A federation is essentially a com-
promise, a dose which is swallowed reluc-
tantly less worse befall. As the years pass
it is bound to get nearer to real union, or
further away from it: it cannot remain
static. Australia’s first Chief Justice well
represented the old order. In judgment after
judgment he put, with brilliant simplicity,
the case for the sovereignty of the States.
He put it so strongly, eventually, that from
about 1907 till the arrival of the war the
central Government found itself with hardly
any real powers at all. The war brought a
period of irresponsible government by pro-
clamation and regulation a virtual despot-
ism—which is now happily coming to an
end. But the old State Rights spirit, which
caused the 1903 Federal election in N. S.
Wales to be fought more than anything else
on the alleged wrongs of the mother State
:it the hands of Victoria, is as good as dead.
No one nowadays wants a perpetuation of
Hughesism; on the other hand, no one is
prepared to revert to Reidism. The younger
generation in the Commonwealth learned
once and for all to be Australians first, and
' ictorians, Queenslanders or what not a
long way afterwards —learned it in the camps
where the A.I.F. trained, in the battlefields
where its regiments fought. It is that spirit
which is reflected by the recent decision of
the High Court in the engineers' case.
* * * ■*
The opinion of Mr. Justice Higgins, which
the Full Bench has upheld, that the Com-
monwealth lias power to control the instru-
mentalities of a State, within certain consti-
tutional limits, implies far more than the
bare fact that the Federal Arbitration Court
is empowered to fix the hours of labor or
rate of wages in the Westralian railway ser-
vice.. In a sense there are no limits to the
possibilities of the doctrine. It certainly
carries the Commonwealth in its relation
to the (States as far in one direction as the
various decisions which were said to have
reduced Mr. Justice Higgins’s jurisdiction
to “a Serbonian bog” did in another. If the
Federal Arbitration Court can deal with
State industries it can also deal with private
ones, the principle being that the Constitu-
tion—having been enacted by the Crown,
whose authority is of the same quality all
over the Empire—confers powers on the
Commonwealth Parliament which are only
limited by the express wording of an Act.
On this theory the Federal Parliament is
also competent, presumably, to pass legisla-
tion to repress intra-State monopolies
tending to restrain trade to the public detri-
ment; it can impose excise duties on sweated
goods or on goods made under conditions dis-
tasteful to Parliament; and it can pass a
valid Trade Marks Act. When this state of
affairs was first foreshadowed nearly a year
ago an echo of the arguments used against
the constitutional amendments proposed in
the referendum campaigns of the past was
heard. Joseph Cook said it was “revolu-
tion” ; and there was general agreement in
Conservative circles that the hour of doom
was at hand. In sense and reason, however,
there is only one argument against the Com-
monwealth having and exercising the widest
possible powers: that is to say, the question
of expedience. There is no difference between
the Australian who is elected to a Westralian
or a Victorian Assembly and the one who
becomes an M.11.R. The Federal member
is no more likely to be a fool, a ruffian or
an enemy of his native (State than the M.L.A.
Similarly a Federal Arbitration Judge could
be relied on to bring the same care and in-
telligence to bear on an industrial matter
in Queensland that he might give to one at his
own back door in Melbourne. Whether a
Victorian Judge who has seen very little of
Westralian conditions is the best man to
adjudicate on a Westralian wages matter;
whether a Parliament sitting in Melbourne
is the best body to legislate for the needs of
the Northern Territory, which 99 per cent,
of the members have never visited —those
are different questions altogether. They re-
present the real objection, on the one side,
to all industrial despotism in the hands of
a single Judge: on the other, to any form'
of centralised government whatever. AN. S.
Wales Industrial Judge living in Sydney is
liable to be just as vague about conditions
of life in Bourke as a Federal Arbitration
Judge on the subject of conditions in Rock-
hampton ; and a N. S. Wales Parliament com-
posed largely of city-dwellers is far from
being a perfect instrument from the point
of view of the rural interests.
* » * *
But there is one very genuine menace to
the peace and good government of the Com-
monwealth in the new orientation of the
High Court —the element of uncertainty
which it introduces and emphasises. Beside
it all the others—the conception of the Com-
monwealth malignantly wronging the States
and so forth —are the dimmest shadows. It
would matter little, in the long run, to indus-
try if the Federal Arbitration Court were
the only one in Australia. With the expert
advice of local committees the single Federal
Court could no doubt give as much general
satisfaction as any number of State ones.
The National Parliament is as well fitted to
legislate for the intra-State trade and com-
merce of Tasmania as the Imperial Parlia-
ment is to legislate for the intra-county trade
and commerce of Kent. But if the Kent
fruit-growers and brewers were never sure
for any length of time who would control
their business destinies, and how, they would
labor under an evident handicap ; and that
is the present position of Tasmania and the
rest of the Australian States. It is a posi-
tion which must endure so long as we cling
to the Federal form of government. Its first
principle is the interpretation by Judges of
the laws passed by Parliament. Now. every
such judgment, Jet the giver of it be howso-
ever great a lawyer, must be flavored by
the Judge’s temperament, his political and
other convictions, and even his age intel-
lectually. Thus in one High Court case after
another a dozen years ago the three elderly
Conservatives (Griffith, Barton and
O’Connor) were found ranged on the one
side; the two mentally youthful Liberals
(Isaacs and Higgins) on the other. So
that the interpretation of an Act depends,
to begin with, on chance. An Isaacs the
more, a Griffith the less, and the whole
destiny of this country might have been
changed. But to make uncertainty more un-
certain there is ,no doctrine of stare decisis
in the Federal sphere. Every High Court
finding is liable to review by the High Court.
Justice Isaacs put this proposition during
the hearing of Hupdart Parker v. More-
itead to the annoyance of Chief Justice
Griffith, who described it,as “altogether in-
consistent with any principle of British
Courts.” However, it is n.qt .only consistent
with the Federal principle. ..but a settled part
of it. as has been very clearly demonstrated
by recent happenings. The decision in the
engineers’ .case was. then, a matter largely
of the time and the man. The present’High
Court Bench is young and liberal and Austra-
lian in its outlook; and in strengthening the
hands of the Federation as against those of
the States it has popular opinion behind it.
But to-morrow another High Court Bench
might be in existence which with perfect
conscientiousness would take the view on this
issue that was taken in the raliway service
case. In other words, at a time when affairs
need to be stabilised as much as possible
in the interests of the national progress, not
vo say safety, there is an influence which
continually works against any sort of
finality. This, and not any absurd question of
the possible injustices done by Federal legis-
lators to their fellow countrymen in the
States, is the basic defect of .our Constitu-
tion ; and it is the strongest argument in
favor of unification —accompanied, of course,
by the multiplication of States vested with
certain specific powers and obligations.
THE DECENTRALISATION THAT IS
BEFORE OUR EYES.
Decentralisation and the settlement of the
interior which goes with it are approached
as if they were the South Pole for inacces-
sibility, the Fourth Dimension for inscrut-
ableness, and the mastodon so far as concerns
the danger of the creature and the need for
caution. The three conditions in every
machine-made politician’s specification are:—
That decentralisation must not in any way dimin-
ish the area ruled over by the present herd of poli-
ticians.
That it must in no way diminish their power, or
the supremacy of the city they live in, or of the
port beside that city.
That it must be done by them and by no one
else, and in some way which involves the raising and
spending (by them) of very large sums of money to
the increase of their importance, if not of their bank
accounts.
Yet Australia has had for many years, before
its eyes and inside its own territory, an
example revealing how decentralisation can
be done without Joseph Carruthers borrow-
ing a thousand millions to settle a million
farmers. It is a pathetically imperfect speci-
men, but it suggests what wonderful things
might happen'in the way of settlement if the
specimen was made perfect.
Queensland built its railways east and west
to carry the trade of three great separate
strata of country to three leading ports—
Townsville, Rockhampton and Brisbane —
with minor lines to other ports, such as
Cairns, Cooktown, Maryborough, Buudaberg
and Normanton. These railways were built
to convey the products of many different
sections of the State to many sea outlets
which weren’t the capital—not as in other
mainland States, and especially in N. S.
Wales and Victoria, to convey it past these
sea-outlets at ruinous cost to the bloated
metropolis. The ports were none too well
selected, else Gladstone and Bowen would
have been preferred to Rockhampton and
Townsville. Further, the systems are not
under separate Governments, but are all con-
trolled in the last resort from the capital.
Still, Queensland is what N. S. Wales would
be if one line stretched inland from Coif’s
Harbor to Armidale, Barraba, Narrabri, Wal-
gett, Brewarrina and Bourke; another from
Jervis Bay to Goulburn, to hook on to the
existing route to Yass, Temora and out to
Hay and the Lachlan; one north-westerly
from Twofold Bay till it struck something
in the vicinity of Albury; and one westward
from Port Stephens. If N. S. Wales had
begun by building in- that fashion and left
the north-and-south connections —the ones
that would link the lines with each other
and with the capital—till afterwmrds, recog-
nising that though such connections were
important they w'ere of secondary import-
ance, it w r ould have followed the Queensland
idea pretty closely.
* * * *
One result has been that of all the main-
land States Queensland has the least conges-
tion in One Big City, and the most diffused
settlement. When Statistician Knibbs made
his last calculation in 1918 he reckoned that
out of every 10,000 inhabitants Queensland
had 2609 in its metropolitan area, while N.
S. Wales had 4107: Westralia, 4248; Vic-
toria, 5057; and S. Aus., 5289. The pre-
liminary census returns have it that West-
ralia has now about 5000 out of every
10,000 subjects located in and around Perth
in the far south-west, the other 5000 having
975,850 square miles disport themselves
in. In other words, Westralia, with most
land to settle, is growing more centralised
and more non-settled and non-developed very
fast. N. S. Wales and Victoria are progress-
ing the same bad way. Yet what Queens-
land did w r as done without any sudden up-
heaval of any sudden saviour with any wild,
screechy scheme for borrowing 30 or three-
thousand millions, and running the whole loan
boom from the capital so that every ghostly
settler would rush there to get at the loot
instead of settling. Queensland Central rail-
way was out as far as Longreach, 427 miles
from the secondary port of Rockhampton, as
far back as 1892. The Northern railway,
starting from the sea at Townsville, reached
Hughenden 1236 miles west) in 1887 and
Cloneurry (481 .mileswest) in 1908. Thanks
to this, less than half as many people are
crowded around Brisbane as cluster around
Adelaide in proportion to the total State
population; and the Melbourne figure is very
little better than Adelaide’s.
* * * *
A still more amazing thing is that, while
N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Aus. and Westralia
grew worse in this matter of congestion, until
Adelaide has nearly five times more of the
population of S. Aus. than it would have
if it were only as bad a case of centralisation
as the worst in Europe—that is in Den-
mark—Queensland steadily tended the other
way until the Labor Government set out to
buy political power. In 1885 Brisbane con-
tained 2476 Queenslanders out of every
10,000. In 1914 it held only 2276, and the
wilderness w 7 as filling. By 1918, as already
mentioned, the vote-purchasing disease had
put the city population up to 2609 per 10,000,
a misfortune unprecedented in the State’s
history. In the density-of-population .map
(based on the census of 1911) on page Jtl2
of Rnibbs’s No. 13 Federal Statistics, there
are eight colorings to show areas with .less
than one .human to 16 square uniles, and
thence up to those with more ;than .16 to one
square mile. By far the greatest part of
Australia .has less than one person to 16
miles. Queensland can show' four separate
districts inside tne tropics which attain to
the comparatively lofty distinction of having
between four and eight people per square
mile. The rest of tropical Australia shows
none, and only one or two very lonesome spots
which run as high as one fellow-creature per
mile. The most northern place in Queens-
land which is in the between-four-and-eight-
per-mile category is in latitude 17%°, and re-
presents about the nearest a pure-white race
has got to the equator in any appreciable
quantity. On the other coast, where West-
ralia tries to govern 975,000 square miles from
a site in one corner, the most northern dis-
trict of similar density is no higher up than
latitude 31°. Queensland actually persuaded
people, sufficient in number to make a patch
of settlement averaging six inhabitants to
the mile, to tear themselves away to a dis-
tance of 900 miles from the fleshpots of the
capital, and it managed to settle several simi-
lar groups at less distances, but still at big
distances. Compared ■•with this (for Aus-
tralia) stupendous effort at decentralisation,
pioneering, populating the empty spaces and
the rest of the guff, the best of the other
mainland States is in the category of the
“also ran,” while the worst was left at the
post.
* * * *
The inference is that when so much (for
Australia—there is always that saving
clause) has been achieved with such a paltry
measure of decentralisation, the whole real
article, which is the subdivision of the coun-
try into States of reasonable and manageable
size, would work wonders. The Australian
mainland consists of five manors in a whole
continent; of a small, reasonably tidy and
reasonably cared-for demesne around each;
and very little save slovenliness and perfunc-
toriness and weeds beyond. Such good as
Queensland has accomplished was put to its
credit before there were wild theorists, wild
patriots, wild regenerators of society, Karl
Marxists and world-savers in office; before
the big loan as it is understood now was
even dreamed of; and before “decentralisa-
tion'’ was in every cheap politician’s month.
The only fairly decent decentralising on Aus-
tralia’s record was done before men knew
the polysyllabic name of what they were
doing, and when everybody began to advocate
it the thing stooped. Above all, it is notable
that Queensland’s bit of pioneering was
achieved by none of the means that figure
in the Joseph Carrutiiers programme, and
solely by simple, sane devices that don’t
even get a mention there.
OFFICIALDOM IN THREE
CENTURIES.
According to the Washington correspondent
of the New York World, a little unplea-
santness which recently befell Lord Nortii-
cliffe in the U.S. capital “is only the first
step in a social boycott which the British
Foreign Office has mapped out to pursue
Lord Northcliffe round the world.” It
i.s a long way from Laud to Lloyd George,
from the_ Ecciesiasticism of 1583 to the
(Joaiitionism of ID2j.. The autnoritarians
were more robust in their preventive mea-
sures three centuries ago. The men who
were then opposing the .Presbyterian move-
ment would have smiled at the idea of dis-
couraging (say) Lord Leicester's friend
Cartwright rrom continuing to advocate
policies of which the Crown disapproved by
causing him to be deprived of free dinners
or lunches. But in the essentials the analogy
between the pamphleteer of Elizabeth’s
reign and the newspaper man of our own
day is interestingly close. The best class
of Englishmen, not merely the Kadical towns-
people and operatives, but Conservative-
minded men about the Court (Burleigh him-
self was one of them), were convinced, long
before the Pilgrim Fathers "bolted in the
Mayflower, that the Crown policy in regard
to the “rebels” was subversive to the best
interest of the kingdom, and could not per-
manently succeed. The temper of the Eng-
lish people has always been hostile to any
attempt whatever on the part of Govern-
ments to bludgeon free speech ; and the Star
Chamber regulations which were devised to
silence the Puritans did more to help them
in the long run, probably, than any factor
outside the inherent justice of their cause.
A couple of hundred years later an exactly
similar contest was in progress. A power-
ful Coalition Ministry (Grenville’s) was
fighting for the privilege which the Lloyd
George Ministry, in effect, claims to-day—
to be allowed to operate with immunity from
hostile criticism. But the press was by this
time exercising a political power unprece-
dented in the history of the kingdom. It
had driven the Asquith of the period into
obscurity. It turned on Lloyd George
Grenville. Grenville silenced Wilkes by
causing the Secretary of State to issue a
general warrant against everybody connected
with his paper, under which 49 people were
arrested and the head of the concern was sent
to the Tower. But, again, the best type of
Englishman was with free speech and against
despotism masquerading as Constitutional
Government. Wilkes had to be three times
elected to the House of Commons and
thrice expelled, the Mayor and aider-
men of London had to proclaim that Parlia-
ment no longer represented the people, the
Americans had to be turned into “rebels”
and the Earl of Chatham into a “trumpet
of sedition” for upholding the justice of
their cause before the liberty of political
criticism which we are now supposed to
enjoy could be established.
Lord Northcliffe, through his papers,
has tackled bigger questions, in a sense,
than any of the publicists who stood for
freedom and justice in the past. He has
had an infinitely greater and more diversified
field to operate in. But his simple and
damning method has been, as theirs was, to
tell the truth about things. The organisa-
tion which he controls provided him with
the facts: and his own independence of party
and class ties did the rest. He began by
drawing attention to the shell-shortage in
Flanders, and Lloyd George approved—it
meant the destruction of the brilliant Welsh-
man’s only rival to the Prime Ministership.
He passed on to an exposure of the Kut
horror, which nearly ruined Lord Hardinge,
one of the most popular men, socially, in
England. He told not merely the truth but
the whole truth about Amritsar; about the
criminal waste of the Mesopotamian cam-


, , nost-war bureaucrats of
paign; about the post w And of
London and then u-eie ■> , Trebind
course he told the truth about Heland.
Ilis offence as regards Ireland is that h<
has not onlv damned the murders done
bv the Sinn Feiners, but also those done by
members of the English army-of-occupation
To make his offence greater, t the Times
is regarded abroad as the lined King-
dom's most representative daily paper,
while the Daily Mail has an even wider
circulation on the European Continent than
the New York Herald. -lust, as at the end
of the 16th century even the humble
"Bmwnists' were being supported against
the Crown by the j?re«it county families ol
England, and' as two centuries later seven
literate Englishmen out of 10 were opposed
to the Government on every issue selected
for criticism by John Wilkes, so to-day
the best characters and intellects of Britain
are dismayed at many of the Lloyd George
policies and certain that they are fore-
doomed to failure. In the cant phrase
of our professional patriots, and of the semi-
educated who rely on them for their think-
ing, North clip ee is a “disloyalist”—as
Burke and Chatham were in the eyes of
such men as North, as Lloyd George him-
self was in the opinion of most of his pre-
sent colleagues when the Boers were given
Dominion status. But he stands in this
respect in the midst of a glittering company
—Bryce, Grey, Gilbert Murray, Robert
Cecil, llrun Cecil, I)r. Clifford, Professor
Toynbee ; Wells, Archer, Bennett and
Shaw ; the Archbishops of Canterbury and
York and practically all the prominent bish-
ops of the Church of England.
It is one of the most disconcerting facts,
from the standpoint, of the Anglophobe, that
whenever such issues have arisen the real
leaders of the nation have reacted to them
in the same way. Nothing is altered save
the punishments devised by the officials—
posing, for the moment, as England-—to
deter the reformers from speaking their
mind. Parson Ac meson was hanged in con-
nection with the “Martin Marprelate” pam-
phlets. Wilkes was banished to France.
Lord Xorthclikfe is not to be asked to
afternoon tea at “the best houses.”
CALLING THE TUNE.
At an ever-accelerating speed Australia is
racing for the ultimate State regulation of
reproduction. The pawky Fisher’s “bangle
bonus” was the first stride in the direction
of this goal. Originally intended as a casual
contribution towards maternity expenses, its
application was made general in order to
avoid the taint of “charity.” But the insti-
tution has become so popular that during
the.past five years a sum of probably £25,000
has been paid out on babies that never were
born. In X. S. Wales, on top of the univer-
sally claimed bonus, Mr. McGiRR has been
distributing, with that lavish generosity
which characterises the man who gives away
other people’s money, layettes in confinement
cases, at a cost in each instance or about
£6. Next we have the A.L.P. Conference
demanding free education from the kinder-
garten to the University. And the free-
handed McGirr proposes to maintain at the
taxpayers’ expense the scholars up to 12
years of age. When the youth leaves school
and finds work and qualifies later as a jour-
neyman, lie is forced to join a union. When
the union strikes he goes to the McGiRRS
once more for State assistance, and, like the
work-shy folk of Broken Hill, lie gets it. In
old age he gets a pension. The A.L.P. ele-
ment in the Sydney City Council wants to
inaugurate a system of municipalised funer-
als, the taxpayer once again to foot the
bill. So that from the cradle to the grave
the coming Australian is to be a charge upon
the State, or, at least, that portion of its
population which has anything taxable.
Obviously the time will come when the
proposal will be made to regulate parentage.
If men and women are to be unashamedly
paid in cash and in kind for becoming
fathers and mothers, for reproducing their
species, then logically enohgh we shall have a
party arising to demand that the section
which pays the piper shall call the tune.
That party will point to the results in some
of the States of the medical inspection of
State-school children, and the alarmingly
high percentage of defectives thus discovered.
Take Tasmania as an example—chiefly be-
cause it possesses certain natural advantages
which would 0 priori lead us to expect that
her children would be physically superior
to those in most other States. Well, the
new party would point to the discoveries
made by three medical inspectors there in
the course of 15 months’ work. They exam-
ined 11,287 children, of whom 4158, or 36.83
per cent., were found to be physically defec-
tive to an extent which was either actively
interfering with their educational progress,
or would, in all human probability, so inter-
fere with it in the near future. And the
standards adopted by the inspectors were
lenient. A special examination was made
of 10,136 of these children to avoid “selec-
tion” influences: 2116 (20.88 per cent.)
were visually defective in some degree, 973
(9.59 per cent.) being defective to an
extent actually interfering with educational
progress. These latter could not read ordi-
nary blackboard writing from back seats, or
could do so only with much strain. Boys
so affected could not learn service-rifle shoot-
ing until fitted with proper glasses. Again,
952 children were deaf to an extent inter-
fering with their educational progress;
1956 (19.29 per cent) were suffering from
post-nasal growths which handicapped their
progress. Qf the whole 11,287 some 142 suf-
fered from dangerous suppuration in the
ears; 100 had pronounced curvature of the
spine; 71 were mentally defective; 149 had
pronounced anaemia; 66 had other serious
defects easily recognisable by teachers. The
teeth were so uniformly bad that a clean,
sound mouth was a rare exception.
The new party will demand something
better than this if it is proposed to con-
tinue paying men for fathering children. It
will say: “We bonus the baby; we provide
it with medicine and clothes (the free cradle
and free perambulator are yet to come) ; we
feed it till it is 12 years old under the
McGirr code; we educate it from the play-
school to the Uni.; we maintain it when it
strikes work in its whiskered manhood; we
pension it in old age; we bury it in death.
So we want to select the healthiest men and
women to father and mother the nationalised
infant. Free selection of partners for repro-
duction is filling our nurseries, kindergartens,
schools, colleges and universities with defec-
tives suffering from spinal curvature, par-
tial deafness,; astigmatism, post-nasal
growths, thin, frail, flat chests, etc. There-
fore we propose to adopt artificial selection.
The parents of the nationalised infant must
bo medically examined before a license is
issued to them t<» add to the burden of the
taxpayer. Take it or leave it.”
The position is logically strong. Irrespon-
sible parenthood, when practised at the ex-
pense of the general community, hasn’t a leg
to stand upon. Communist journals in
Europe are at present discussing the sugges-
tion which this involves, and as the A.L.P.
is drifting in that direction, it cannot grumble
if a new party, which will include hundreds
of medical men and school teachers, takes
up the suggestion, and advocates the sterili-
sation of the unfit. When the unfit demand
that other folk should keep their defective
babies, it brings the proposition into the
realm of practical politics. Already Mrs.
Cowan, M.L.A., in the Westralian Parlia-
ment, has advocated the doing of this. Per-
sonally, T object to it. What I want to
make clear to the bone-headed politicians
and the stupid voters who sell their fran-
chise for State fish and State chops and
State-fed and -clothed babies, and all kinds
of State doles, gifts, endowments, pensions
and subventions, is that they will have to
pay the price eventually. They may even get
free restaurants and music-halls and
theatres, as in Russia, but they will get a
Lenin who will call the tune, and select the
music and the play and the bill of fare.
JOB LESINA.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Minority Rule Looms Up Again.
Through the lolly of the 13 Cocky mem-
bers in joining forces with Prendergast’s
party, which demands cheap bread and a
scheme of electoral distribution that would
place the country at Melbourne’s mercy, Vic-
toria is to have another general election. It
will be a costly luxury, and one that, in
view of the people's verdict nine months ago,
should have been totally unnecessary, and if
the badly-led Country party gets a sharp
lesson on August 30 it will be no more than
it deserves. In its attitude, to the Lawson
Government it has betrayed a narrow and
vindictive spirit. The Government has its
faults, but inattention to country, interests
is not one of them. It has done more to
foster country industries and revive the
hopes of the neglected outports (Portland,
for instance) than any other Victorian Gov-
ernment for the last five and twenty years.
And its handling of the finances has been
in every way admirable: Victoria, under its
administration, boasts the lightest taxation
in the Commonwealth and the lowest per
capita debt. Lawson describes himself, not
unfairly, as “an apostle of co-operation,” and
the Country party is supposed to stand for
the co-operative principle. But because the
Government refused to apply pressure to the
thousands of farmers who have declared
that they don’t want any more compulsory
wheat pools, the Cocky faction turned against
it. In opposition to his own political creed,
the C.P. leader rejected the Government’s
offer to substitute a voluntary co-operative
pool and back it with a guarantee of 2s,
6d. per bushel net, and allied himself with
the State Socialists to effects its destruction.
Therein he exhibited not only inconsistency
and bad judgment, but an arrogant disre-
gard for the rights of individuals and a
bigoted misconception of the functions of
government. During the war the compulsory
pooling (or commandeering) of wheat was
justified on the ground of public necessity.
But the justification existed no longer when
war conditions ceased. To say now, as the
Labor and Country parties do, that no
farmer shall sell his wheat except through
the Government, or some organisation nomi-
nated by the Government, is a thing that no
responsible Administration can admit or
free community endure. It would be a mon-
strous exercise of the tyranny of majorities,
and the Lawson Government is warranted
in resisting it to the last ditch. In the
general weariness of the old order
political, the Country party has gained some
successes. The. public has generously over-
looked the fact that it speaks with different
voices in different States: that in Westralia
it has a working arrangement with Mitchell
and in Queensland and N. S. Wales remains
coldly aloof. The wild divergencies of
opinion shown by the Federal Country mem-
bers on the tariff issue were also good-humor-
edly tolerated. But the patience of the
electors has its limits, and incidents like the
Allan-Prendergast alliance will soon
exhaust it. If the farmers’ groups are merely
in business to play off one party against
another and use the powers of government
to coerce reluctant members of their own
class, their political career will be short and
troublous. Victoria needs stable govern-
ment, and can get it by returning Lawson
with an adequate majority. In the alterna-
tive it will probably be cursed with a rapid
succession of weak Ministries brought into
existence to grant some concession to a
politically corrupt and irresponsible third
party, and, dismissed when this sordid purpose
has been served.

Russia and Australia.
Lenin, the Bolshevik dictator, the darling
of the class in Australia which doesn't work
but establishes Councils of Action and plans
to disfranchise dll save itself, is reported to
have taken another step on the road back
to “bourgeois”, respectability and plain deal-
ing. As the price of the readmission of his
starved, stricken, bedevilled country into
decent society, and of the assistance of people
with brains to put it right and undo his
own work, he has offered that Russia shall
take up again the burden of that foreign debt
which it repudiated so gaily four years ago.
The inference is that repudiation, however
fascinating, doesn’t pay, for no one imagines
that Lenin has experienced a change of
heart and become a member of ..the.. Salv'-
Army. The confiscation of the lands was in
a great measure a failure from the first, for
the peasant farmers stodgily refused to know
anything about ir, and those who succeeded
the old big landlords declined to produce
more than enough for their own needs.
Lately the partially-tamed dictatorship has
been speaking kindly to foreign capitalists
and asking them to come with money and
re-establ.su the regime of wage-slavery in
manufacturing industries; but until the re-
pudiation policy was abandoned foreign capi-
talists thought it was only an invitation
to the duck to come and be killed. In fact,
the, Bolshevist policy has failed at every
point; and if Soviet Russia, with much more
than twice Australia’s area and anything
between 20 and 30 times its population,
couldn’t lead the outlaw life successfully
and be a world to itself, the prospects
for this country, should its Councils of
Action and such-like bodies get control, look
poor. It has cost an appalling amount in
life and money and happiness to educate
Lenin and co. so far as they have got, and
it would probably cost Australia about as
much per head to educate Garden, Walsh,
Willis and the 0.8.TJ. generally. The cap-
tain of the first United States relief ship
which reached Russia with food sent home
a condensed account of what struck his eye
in the capital. “People were so weak with
starvation and disease that they were unable
to walk” ; “wooden houses had been used for
firewood” ; “only seven tramcars remained in
Petrograd,” which vvgs a proud city of
2,318,000 people before the bottom fell out
of local civilisation. “A short tram-ride
costs 80,000 roubles” (£800(3. before money
began to be expressed in terms of Bolshevik
paper) ; “a pound of butter, 22,000 roubles”
(£2200 nominal) ; “a pair of shoes, 30,000”
(£3000) : “hairpins, 700 each” (£7O) : “eggs,
2000 each” (£200). Petrograd is the width
of European Russia away from the famine-
stricken south-east:; and a crop failure some
800 miles away can’t be blamed for tin* boots,
the tram-rides, the hairpins and the fact that
(he city is being used as fuel. The story of
the seven remaining tramcars suggests a simi-
lar decay in trains, and this breakdown of
communication helps to explain the famine
and other things. The lesson for us is that
if Bolshevism —cal! it what you will-had
spread its regenerating influence over the
world, as it hoped and intended in its young
days, and as the Perth Labor Conference
would have liked it to do, all the world would
have been another Petrograd, and there
would be no place to send food or clothes
or the seeds of a new civilisation. The thing
that we have may be far from perfect; the
thing that these cranks would drop us into
is too horrible to contemplate. It is ouite
unnecessary to impugn their motives,
Willis, Garden, Walsh . and the rest of
them may be full of the best intentions. But
there never was a hell more terrible than
the one to which their good intentions pave
the way. And that is no longer a matter
of speculation or assumption or inference.
It is a matter of fact, established by the
cry of the stricken people who have put the
principles of the Direct Action party to the
test.
Preliminary. Sheaves of the Harvest.
This is the time of year when the person
who shoved his neighbor’s ass into the pit
gains credit for being one- of a rescue party
to haul it out, and the person who stripped
the widow accumulates kudos through pass-
ing the hat to buy her a garment. In every
Australian city where the winter is cold
there are tales of suffering, but Sydney, as
the biggest and most closely packed city,
naturally predominates in grief. There is
talk of “1000 little Australians who are cold
and cheerless,” short of clothes, food and
fuel—this despite all the doles of the most
doleful Cabinet Australia has ever possessed,
the unparalleled taxation, the record ordinary
expenditure, loan expenditure, loan works,
cheap-food; schemes as laid out in the Anti-
Profiteering law, the reduced working hours,
the basic wage and the kindly, old-hen-like
interference with everything. Some of the
stories are pitiable enough. Here is one
day’s record at one centre of misery—the
Sydney Children’s Clothing Committee depot :
One child was seized with convulsions in its
mother’s arms. Another baby in arms was blue with
the cold. Another child, scantily clad, was sent
straight to the hospital suffering from pneumonia.
There were women who applied for relief and they
had not the clothes that ordinary decency demands
they should wear. Miserably ill-clad themselves,
they only asked for help for their children.
One typical case.... The husband has been five
months out of work and he is prepared to do any-
thing. He is the father of eight children. His wife
is ill with influenza. The family are sleeping on the
bare boards and are using bags for blankets.
Minister McGirr’s Motherhood Endowment
or Child Pension scheme should do some-
thing for six of the eight children if they
are all under 14. And the rest of the Gov-
ernment programme should do a lot to keep
the father out of work. Of course he may
get a job on a loan railway somewhere near
the city, but that sort of job is pitiably
temporary. And then the aftermath of it, in
the shape of the heavy loss and the interest
bill, is left for no one can tell how many
years (the period has already been 57 years
in the case of the Blacktown-Richmond line)
to aggravate the misery of just such chil-
dren and just such fathers and mothers in
the future. There is no one more despic-
able than the loan-mongering Minister who
spends his borrowings wholesale on works
that don’t pay interest, and makes his politi-
cal path easy by leaving new burdens to such
children as those who haunt clothing depots;
yet for some unexplained reason that kind
of man often gets a better funeral than
decent citizens. Every Australian infant is
born a vastly burdened slave, not so much on
account of wars in defence of his country as
on account of the fact that those who went
before had a hot old time and left him to
pay for the drinks. And a large and increas-
ing proportion of infants are born under an-
other curse and doom —the doom of having no
trade that they can carry about the world
with them, and of being odd-jobbers all their
days, ranking with the coolie and tin; rest
of the human lower stratum. They are “pre-
pared to do anything,” hut when the loan
money or . the wharf-lumping gives out'there
is often nothing for them to do. The increas-
ing demand, artificially created by the tribe
of union or political bosses, for shorter
hours,, less . production and a whole day’s
pony-racing on Saturdays doesn’t help to
make life any easier. The high cost of
living is always present in a country which
produces little but raw material for export
to the far ends of the earth, and buys most
of its made-up goods at the other fellow’s
prices, the other fellow being also at the
far ends of the earth. It doesn’t help, either,
when the same .bosses close up towns like
Mount Morgan, Broken Hill and Mount Lyell
with the ultimatum that no work must be
done unless the workers get the full product
of their labor and big subsidies in addition.
The basic-wage idea, which has attached to
it no proviso about doing any basic work, is
another drawback. And if some day meas-
ures like Minister McTiernan’s Profiteer-
ing Bill pass without being censored as the
N.S.W . Upper House censored that remark
able scheme, industry in general, apart from
the Government stroke on loan works, will
live on the feather-edge of disaster, also on
the sufferance of the Government’s minions.
Industry is precarious in these circumstances,
as is seen by the record of countries where,
in every line of work, the crop is reaped by
the pasha’s permission and consists of as
much as the pasha happens to leave. And
as overgrown cities have a tendency to be
associated with misery, so Australia's habit
of robbing the country of people to make
big cities is part of the evil. The crowd at
the Children’s Clothing Committee Depot
and similar haunts —the children who are
blue with cold, empty of food and almost
devoid of clothing, also the mothers whose
garments are barely decent and the fathers
who want to trv their hands at anything—
are only preliminary sheaves of the harvest.
“A Rebel Organisation.”
Am attempt is being made to organise a
Transport Workers’ Union, which must
necessarily include the Seamen's Union
among its principal units; and the draft
of its rules has aroused the fury of Tom
Walsh, the Seamen’s president, because
there is in it no avowed rebellion, upheaval,
anarchy or destruction ol law, propertv, life,
popular liberties or the Australian Consti-
tution. It even proposed (and here T.
Walsh flew off the handle) that at a. con-
ference meeting “the president should refuse
to submit to the committee of management
any unconstitutional or illegal motion.” In
a land where the people have all the power
they have taken the trouble to give them-
selves so that they may get a fair deal without
being unconstitutional or illegal, this seems
reasonable enough. But the imported man
was shocked and enraged at. the idea of noi
being allowed to be contrary to our rules
and illegal to our laws in our own country,
and at losing his chance to use an Austra-
lian organisation as a weapon with which
to bang Australian rights, properties and
self-respect about. “Fancy putting stuff
like that in a constitution for a rebel organ-
isation !” he exclaimed. The theory may be
advanced that his own “stuff” can be
passed over with contempt as the guff'
of a person of no account; but no
one knows for certain how much ac-
count anybody is if given an oppor-
tunity. Certainly he once started what
might have been, and was apparently meant
to be, a very brisk rebellion or Bolshevik
uprising in Melbourne, and its failure didn’t
alter the fact that the intentions were bad
enough. The fact that the leader wasn’t
given either a sentence or a notice to quit
on that occasion probably inspired him with
confidence and convinced him that Austra-
lians are a prideless lot whose ideas of
majority rule any truculent missioner can
treat much as he pleases. Anyhow, it is
unpleasant to be continually threatened,
flouted and insulted ; even the constant jeers
of a dwarf are annoying. If it is only a nigger
who habitually and of set purpose wipes
his boots on our equivalent for “Old
Glory,” he should be taught better manners
for his own good and ours, and be put in
his place. The revolutionary pervert, the
sex pervert and the homicidal pervert are all
in the category of nuisances and abnormali-
ties, and revolution affords such chances for
murder and sexual crimes that one man may
play all three parts.

Recent Elections in Queensland.
Fob 30 years Labor in Queensland has been
saying “Give us One Adult One Vote in
Local Government elections and we will show
.von what we can do,” and there can be no
doubt whatever that the Theodore Govern-
ment introduced adult suffrage into local gov-
ernment in the full confidence that it would
swing the councils right round to the party
Theodore stands for. As a proof of cock-
sureness .several members of the State
Assembly adventured into the arena—-to be
crushed flat by the veriest Bumbles among
their opponents. Premier Theodore, asked
for his opinion on the general result, attri-
buted it to the indifference of the mass of the
workers, who regard local- government as a
“pettifogging business” that can be safelv
left to the Tories. But the facts as proved
by the voting mock at this theory of Theo-
dore’s. In Brisbane 70 p.e. of the electors
on the roll voted, and in country towns which
have been returning Labor men to Parlia-
ment as many as SO p.c. And in a contest
so keen, out of 740 contested seats only 60
went to Labor—a result emphatic enough to
convince anyone of a revolution in public
opinion. The simple explanation is that
there is no Tory like the working-man when
his own pocket, is affected. The Queensland
manual toiler is seldom a taxpayer to the
State Treasury, but he is very frequently
a property-owner in a small way and con-
sequently. a ratepayer. He tolerates the
State squandermania because he imagines
the resulting taxation hits only a certain
legendary Fat Man ; but lie knows perfectly
well that when the local government rates
go up his little allotment and cottage have to
bear the burden. Hence the queer spectacle
ot .John Hornyhand voting Labor at the
State election and Anti-Labor municipally,
there is no consistency in this, perhaps, but
there is a mighty lot of human nature. An-
other point that weighed with the allegedly
Socialistic, voter was the widespread belief
that if tlje Labor party were successful it
would immediately introduce payment of
aldermen and shire councillors. The verv
mention of such a thing is anathema to
Queensland workers, who have seen Parli;.-
nientary salaries lifted in their own State to
£5OO a year and elsewhere to £lOOO, while

the morale of the recipients has fallen very
obviously. The unemployed also played a
part, and in very many cases a calm and
deliberate part, against an administration
whose methods have bred idleness and hunger
and distress in a country of great natural
riches. On the whole, then, it looks as if
Keason has resumed business among the elec-
tors. In the last State election a majority
ol them voted against the party which lias
been dragging the good name of Labor in the
ditch; in the. municipal and shire contests
an overwhelming majority have voted to the
confusion of the I n.on bosses; and now in

by the Farmers’ party.
Joseph and the Farmer’s Wife.
The census-taker is unloading some enlight-
ening commentar.es on Joseph (Jarruth-
ers’s pian of borrowing £39,600,000 and
therewith establishing "a min.on farmers
on a million farms.” Since 11)11 the State
Governments have spent more than three
times £30,000,000 on loan railways “to pro-
mote settlement,” advances to farmers, dis-
tressed and otherwise, immigration, irriga-
tion, water supply, rabbit-proof fences, re-
purchase of estates and ‘‘agricultural develop-
ment.” In addition the Commonwealth has
lavished huge sums on the Northern Terri-
tory, soldier-settlement and the provision of
unpayable telegraphs and telephones in coun-
try districts. And the result is that the
rural population has gone up a whole 8.81
per cent. During the same 10 years the
six coastal capitals increased their popula-
tion by 87.87 per cent. And the State with
the worst record is Westralia, which boasts
the highest per capita expenditure on land-
settlement and loan railways; since 1911
Perth has gained 45.26 per cent, and the
country only 7.55 per cent., while the pro-
vincial towns have lost 11.08 per cent, of
their people. Omitting Commonwealth ex-
penditure as aforesaid, Westralia had' to
pawn its future for £15,000,000 to add
40,000 to the rural population, natural in-
crease included. At this rate the dost of
shoving Joseph’s million farmers on their
million farms, allowing for the fact that
loan money is at least 2 per cent, dearer
than it was when ihe Westraliau Govern-
ments were hitting things up, would be some
thing ferocious. Beckoning it. at £2OOO a
man (and that is £lOOO per head less than
the soldier-settlement scheme is now expected
to run into), it would work out at nearly
six times the present Commonwealth debt.
Joseph talks confidently of borrowing the
money from Britain. But considering the
reception Theodore got when he asked for
a mere £9,000,000, the prospect of extract-
ing £2,000,000,000 from the harassed old
gentleman in London (it would amount to
nearly 30 per cent, of the present British
national debt, and more than three times
the pre-war debt) is remote. Supposing that
by some financial alchemy the £2,000,000,000
could be obtained, there would remain the sev-
eral difficulties—to mention three among a
multitude —of finding the million farms, col-
lecting the million farmers, and keeping them
<m their land once you got them there. The
last has been 'lie baffling problem of all
Australian setti. inent booms. At a conser-
vative estimate 60 per cent, of those infected
by the periodical land epidemics throw up
their holdings and return to the city. In
most cases they discover, when the first
drought hits them, that they have mistaken
their vocation, but sometimes they depart for
domestic reasons. With rare exceptions the
modern city-bred woman pines for the shops
and the pictures and the bathing-beaches and
the little intimate chats over the back fence,
and a pining woman on a farm generally
gets her own way in the end. Nor is the
malady of the city confined to the wife and
daughters of the new settler. It is strong
among women who. except at rare intervals,
have , known no other life than that of the
farm. Hence, to a large extoj.it, the per-
sistent baek-to-the-city movement that is
going on among the rural population. (Some-
times the selection is sold and the whole
family removes to the capital, where Dad
gets work as a laborer, Dave as a police-
man and the girls as waitresses and shoo-
ladles: sometimes Ma and her daughters do
the shifting, leaving Dad and Dave to toil
in the fields. That is one of the reasons
why there are 196.444 fewer females than
males iij the rural districts. In the s s \
capitals, on the other hand there are 108,907
more women than men. Tir's appnllTig dis-
parity between the sexes is a question that
ought to take precedence of nrv proposal
for a wild land-and-loan drunk. If the causes
of it were removed —and the only way to
remove them is to make country life more
desirable to both men and women —there
mightn’t be any occasion for wild land-and-
loan drunks.
The Tragic Comedy of the Soldier-Judge.
In Dublin, a few days ago, some events hap-
pened which have an important bearing on
the question of military, and its adminis-
tration. Before the truce Joseph Egan was
sentenced to death by a court-martial for
“being in possession of ammunition.” His
ease somehow got to the Chancery Division of
the Irish High Court, and in the words of
a Sun cable :
The Master of the Rolls said that Egax had been
tried by a military Court constituted, in some way
unknown to law, by military- officers. This Court
had no legal status, and whatever penalty- it awarded
had no sanction of British law.
It has been estimated by English lawyers who
have visited Ireland recently that about 25
per cent. Oa the courts-martial of the current
year have been illegally constituted, in some
cases from carelessness and in others from
ignorance. Legal members of the U.S.A.
Commission which visited Ireland went back
and told their fellow-countrymen of men
being presented for trial without knowing
what was charged against them till they
faced the Court. Many were undefended,
and more were given no opportunity to call
their witnesses; while those who were con-
demned to death (except in some of the most
populous centres) were dealt with so quickly
that they had no opportunity to get their
cases reviewed. It lias to be remembered
that most of the men in charge of the court-
martial machine in Ireland are professional
soldiers who were forced to learn something

THE PRIEST: “ Who giveth thin woman?”
THE INTERNATIONALIST: “I do.”
about law and procedure as part of their
military course. If they were capable of
sentencing men to death under the authority
of “a court constituted in some way un-
known to law,” it is easy to imagine the mis-
carriages of justice which must inevitably
occur on active service under volunteer offi-
cers—men who, where they do not happen
to be lawyers, have had even less legal ex-
perience than regular soldiers. Should it be
argued that the court-martial officers who
made a farce of justice in connection with
Egan’s case could not have been professional
soldiers, it may be pointed out that some of
the most senior men in the British Army list
showed up no better as lawyers a few days
later. According to aS. M. Herald mes-
sage
Mr. Justice O’Connor, of the Irish High Court,
issued a habeas-corpus writ against Generals Sir
Nevili, Macreadt (Commander-in-Chief in Ireland),
Major-General Sir Edward Strickland, and Major-
General Cameron, also against the governor of the
Limerick prison, directing them to produce two men
alleged to have been illegally sentenced to death,
fhey refused, whereupon the Judge made an
order for their attachment for contempt. The
Court stayed the proceedings later, as the
men were released. The Generals would
not have suffered the indignity had they
known the Army law even in its application
to officers of their own rank. In 1743 Chief
Just’ce Wtlles had a Rear-Admiral and
others arrested for contempt, and held till
they apologised to his Court in abject terms,
for an olfence on all fours with that of which
the Generals in Ireland were guilty last week.
Could better proof be offered of the necessity
of taking all judicial work in the Army out of
the hands of soldiers? The Federal Govern-
ment is apparently rather ashamed of its new
Army Legal Department. The Acting-
Premier has pointed out, for example, that
it is only go.n<> to be a trifling affair, the
total upkeep of which “will not exceed £894.”
On the evidence which has been coming to
hand lately it would be cheap at not much
short of the price of the Army Medical Corps
—always provided it was as efficient.

The racket about the ownership of Silesia,
which has been dragging France and Britain
is a matter of self-preservation for
the former and don’t-care-feel-too-tired-not-
my-funeral with the latter. France wants
Poland to have the whole province, which
was Polish till 1355, Bohemian till 1475,
Hungarian till 1526, Austrian till 1763 and
Prussian afterwards. Because of its great
wealth of coal and iron Prussia was changed
from an agricultural and pastoral State to
be the bully of Europe and later of the world,
and while Prussia retains Silesia or the best
part thereof it is still liable to bully. Its
claim to retain part at least of the steal is
based on the nationality of some of the in-
habitants- —that is to say, Prussians were
sent there just as British people were sent
to Ulster. The British view is that if Prus-
sia remains rich and powerful it will be the
better able to pay the indemnity, and that
Silesia isn’t a danger because it is an inland
place where no fleet can be built, and a new
Hun fleet would be Britain’s only risk. The
French view is that Silesia, being remote as
welj as rich, is a very good place to organise
in secret a new Hun army, which is France’s
risk. Disarmament, of course, is supposed
to obviate risks of this sort, but all-round
disarmament won't greatly reduce them. Ten
thousand trained men (with, of course, a
nation of more or less untrained men to
follow up the attack) are as good as 100,000
if the other fellow has only 5000, and a
bow is as good as a Big Bertha if it carries
further than the other fellow’s bow. And
as a 10 000-man army can be lr'dden in a
hole and a corner while a much bigger one
can't, small armaments reallv conduce to a
surprise attack just ns they did in the days
of Saul and. the PhTistines. France wants
Silesia and its wealth to belong to Poland
because Poland is far away, while Hun-
land is not quite an inch away where the
borders meet. Britain, whose borders no
longer touch Hun territory anywhere has
forgotten what sleeping with a very bi»
gorilla in the next bed is like.

According to the Paris Journal des Debats
the Imperial Conference has jettisoned the
Japanese Alliance. This is not strictly true
at the moment, since the Alliance is still in
force, and will continue to operate until it is
denounced by either party—and 12 months’
notice has to be given. But there can be no
doubt that the Asiatic policy to which Britain
committed itself in the 1911 agreement is
being mod.lied. In the official report of the
Conference the “anxiety” of the Premiers
that “.some larger arrangement between the
three Great Powers concerned in the Par
Bast and the Pacific should be substituted
for the Anglo-Japanese agreement” is signifi-
cantly stated. Japan’s attitude is that it
is not only ant.pathetic to such a proposal,
but undisguisedl.y angry. In an unusually
ill-tempered communication issued from the
Japanese Embassy in London, Britain is
blamed for having inspired the Harding pro-
posal for a disarmament conference, and
imperialistic ambitions in Asia are attributed
to the U.S.A. Japan, it appears, regards
disarmament without enthusiasm, but is will-
ing to reduce its military programme if the
Washington Government does likewise.
America’s zeal for the open-door policy in
China is contrasted with its own exclusion
Policy and that of Australia. All which
(and there is a good deal more of it) is, at
any rate, welcome evidence that the great
English-speaking nations have drawn closer
together, and that militaristic Japan is
chagrined thereby.
One thing was lacking even in the most
friendly obituaries of T. J. Ryan, Labor Pre-
mier of Queensland from 1915 to 1919. No
one was prepared to say that he was qualified
to manage the finances of a heavily-embar-
rassed State. He was described as big and
breezy and bluff and broad-chested and kind-
hearted. But he was no liquidator or
official assignee. Having provided a good
time in his own hearty way for everybody, he
was in a difficult situation when his unruly
children took possession of Townsville and
stopped business and rioted around. So after
raising taxation over 250 per cent, (from
2Ss. 2d. to 795. lOd. per head) he left the
Queensland Premiership to become a private
member in a strange State. With two big
deficits on hand and a third bigger one in-
evitable, despite heroic taxing which had
made his the most burdened State in the
Commonwealth, there were two possible ex-
planations of the exit. Possibly he knew so
little of the value of money that he didn’t
realise that there was anything wrong; or
possibly again he knew that things were very
wrong and that he wasn’t at all the sort of
person to set them right. In the latter case
he hit the bull’s-eye. Most Australian States
have now got to the point at which an honest
unflinching banker is three-fourths of a good
Ministry, and the other fourth hardly
matters.
Arbitration Judges are apt to give decision--
which are embarrassing, like the orders thai
the A.L.P. Executive gives to the harassed
STOREY Government about doing conjuring
tricks and taking millions out of a hat. In
one of its happy moments the Court reduced
the proportion of apprentices in the engineer
ing trade to one for three journeymen,
whereas in N. S. Wales five to four journey-
men were once allowed, and still the trade
wasn ( so full that importation of engineer-
ing goods ceased. So the taking on of new
learners ceased pending the time when the
lot on hand will be worked off. and thus
another avenue was closed against the rising
generation. Again, the high authority re-
duced hours from 4< to 44 and increased
the wages in the Lithgow arms factory. This
tended to reduce output, to raise the eosi
of the goods produced, and to give the em-
ployees more time to find the beauties of
Lithgow. But the Federal Customs revenue
is dropping like Lucifer; so it was decided
to keep the outlay at the factory to the old
figure: and as the money wouldn’t go round
the old number of men the conclusion was
that 200 had to go and find other work or
add themselves to the unemployed list. The
men replied by a proposal that the hours
should be further cut to 36 and the wages
paid accordingly, so as to obviate dismissals.
This would mean that the result of the
Court s interference would be less production
at more cost, no more wages per man, but
another 11 hours per week to fill in (with
doubtless some small outlay in the filling)
amid the doldrums of a little coaly town
Either way it meant that 200 men,' or the
equivalent of 200 men, were to cease produc-
tion in a country which-already produces too
little and imports a great deal more than
it can afford to pay for—cease work and
settle down to dry-rot. Somebody is sup-
posed to benefit by this sort of thing. Who
is it?

POLITICAL
POINTS
Tudor’s sickness, followed by the death
of Ityan, is causing some speculation over
the leadership of Federal Labor. Tudor is
nominally leader still, but the cubs of the
party will not be satisfied with the old gen-
eral or any of the ancients who support him.
The loss of Jim Page has cut off one of
his strongest followers, and assuming (as
seems likely) that the man who succeeds
Ryan will be a red-ragger, the old brigade
will be outvoted in the Caucus. The out-
look is pretty dismal for Tudor. It is cer-
tain that if Lambert is nominated and
elected for West Sydney, the half-baked
young economists of the Left will endeavor
to make him commander-in-chief.
If John Storey can get his way Catts,
M.H.R., will be next Agent-General of N. S.
Wales. His resignation from the Federal
House would create a vacancy in a sure
Labor electorate (Newtown I—-a circum-
stance of much interest to A.L.P. chairman
Bill Lambert and others in case anything
should slip in connection with the party
selection for West Sydney.
The late Jim Page won Maranoa (Q.)
for Labor by 6426 votes in 1910, 6458 in
1913, 2441 in 1917 (there was no contest
in 1914) and 1242 in 1919. Dunstan, the
A.W.U. man who carried the blue-and-wliite
banner on July 30, predicted that he would
hold the seat by a majority of 1500. In the
result Hunter, the Country Party candidate,
will beat him by more than Page beat Hun-
ter by two years ago. It is a plain warning
to Dunstan’s party to pause in its confused
career. No country has much use for a
party that doesn’t know its own mind, and
has to have a conference every few months
to determine its principles. At present it
doesn’t even .seem to know whether it stands
for a White Australia or not.
From the scene of the disturbance: —
It took his Ex. four days to decide to give Lawson
the dissolution he sought after his team had been
outed by a combination of Labor and Cocky. Pren-
dergast and Allan each had two interviews with
him, but nothing <■ of them. A couple of hours
after Allan had sai his last good evening an arrange-
ment was fixed up under which Labor wa to get
tentative support from the Cockies, but it was then
too late. In the meantime Peacock had been sent
for, and when that amiable person declined to take
on the job of trying to form a Government (he
showed more consideration for Lawson than Lawson
had for him when the Lawson-Bowser Ministry was
formed in 1918), there was no alternative to a
dissolution. So the machinations of the non-Liberals
were foiled, and the hope of Castlemaine is asking
the State to either give him a mandate to rule or
pass him out. The last time a Castlemaine Pre-
mier (,T. B. Patterson) got a dissolution and appealed
to the electors? (1894) he struck disaster, but George
Turner was then the alternative, and neither Prender-
gast nor Allan is within coo-ee of the modest little
grey lawyer.
Federal Treasurer Cook forecasts a big
fall in revenue this year, and as the country
can’t go on importing at anything like the
recent rate the decline in Customs returns
SPOILING THE PARTY.
“The N.S.W. State Parliament will open on Tuesday, August 30. The Premier (Mr. Storey), in
announcing this decision, said that one of the first measures to come before the Legislative Assembly
would be the Motherhood Endowment Bill.”
THE UNINVITED THIRD: “You haven't forgotten me, have you, John?”
will probably surprise even Cook. He says
economy is urgent, and an obvious way to
economise is by the abolition of the payment
(in cash) of £5 for each baby whether rich
or poor.' If Cook feels like it the £5 per
offspring might still be paid, but paid into
a sinking fund for the reduction of the public
debt. Then the infant would get the benefit
when he grows up instead of his father back-
ing a loser with the money before he is old
enough himself to tell a horse from a heifer;
and the infant of next and subsequent gener-
ations would also' feel the relief.
As a result of Alec Poynton’s visit to
Darwin the N.T. is to lose its State hotels.
A cynic once defined a State hotel as a reck-
less gamble on the honesty of a man
behind a beer-engine. Poynton doesn’t im-
pugn the honesty of the gents, who assuage
the Territory’s thirst, but sadly observes that
the Government is losing money on every
pot and tot. It will be another count in
the indictment of the Darwin militants
against the cursed capitalistic Government.
Hell has no fury like a Direct Actionist de-
prived of his cheap beer.
Years ago, rvhen the loan market was
booming, the Westralian Government estab-
lished (in Perth, of course) a free Univer-
sity, having a vague impression that it would
somehow retard the process of turning the
youth of the country into clerks and laborers
and typistes and shop-assistants and picture-
ushers. Among other expensive luxuries
there is a Chair of Agriculture, and Maley,
the Cocky member who looks after that indus-
try for the Mitchell Government, recently
discovered that a whole seven students were
taking the agricultural course. "There is
too much damned bookkeeping in this State,”
was his despairing comment. Of course there
is too much bookkeeping—and too much
bookmaking also. They are among the fruits
of the-enthusiastic borrowing, importing, cen-
tralising and socialising policies that the
Westralian Governments have followed for
the last 20 years. Seeing that there were
recently 155,129 inhabitants in Perth and
only 174,099 in the rest of the State, with
the figures steadily growing worse, what else
can Maley expect?
The A.L.P. executive has intimated that
the N.S.W. Ministerial horse must get a
smart canter on with its 10-ton load or else
lose its oats. Among other things, the child-
pension scheme must be got to work whether
there is money or not. According to the
executive this scheme is such a sure winner
that it is calculated to give the party 20
years’ certainty of office, to "pave the way to
wonderful power,” and to win over “hundreds
of thousands of inveterate enemies.” The
downward slither of the Theodore Ministry
in Queensland i.s ascribed to ! lack of sufficient
violence,, and the Storey Government is
warned to be violent at any price. It is a
curious division of authority. The crowd
outside Parliament says to the crowd in-
side “Move that mountain at once.” The in-
side crowd says “How?” and the outside one
says “Duuno ! But move it.”
Barwell, Premier of S. Aus., is in difficul-
ties. He stands for constitutional action;
and constitutional action has somehow got.
itself mixed up with industrial arbitration,
which is represented to be the antithesis of
direct action. But Barwell, being a com-
monsense person, knows that industrial arbi-
tration has a long way to go yet before it is
perfect. The labor which has gone to arbi-
tration without a strong organisation has
had Buckley’s chance of getting a high wage
or greatly improved conditions. Barwell
knows that arbitration courts and wages
boards and the like have thus made awards
which changed conditions don’t justify ; and
once more Labor, which has been mostly
despising arbitration tribunals of late years,
has come rushing to their defence. “So you
believe in Direct Action, do you?” Barwell
is a sked; and if Barwell is wise he will reply
—“No, I believe in Arbitration when you
can show me how I can get an arbitration
tribunal, acceptable to the labor unions,
which will do something more than merely
register the gains that Direct Action or the
threat of it is able to secure.”
It is probable that ,foe N.S.W. income-tax
will be again increased. If the Government
carries through its plans of wholesale alms-
giving. in the coming session, what else is
to be expected? The plans include widow
pensions, pensions for all children after No.
2 in the family and orphan pensions whether
the child is No. 2 or any other figure. There
is something to be said for all these, and a
Ministry which knew how to get at least
Hid. worth of value for a shilling could
afford to deal with them. But already the
Government has added £5,000,000 (or
£10,000,000, including loan expenditure) to
the State’s annual outgoings before the
philanthropic schemes are started. The anti-
cipated profits of the proposed lottery won't
cover the existing deficit, so all the cost of
the new schemes must come out of new taxes.
The chance to carry the programme depends
on Dan Levy taking the chair again. If
lightning struck Daniel, and his place was
filled by another Nationalist who wouldn’t
take the chair, all need for the extra taxes
should pass away. This paper would bate
to feel that its death would be a blessing to
so many people.
The callous but trouble-saving policy of
shoving returned soldiers wholesale “on the
land” is constantly being heard of in some
new place. A newspaper report lately added
to the list of disappointments Macquarie
Vale, near Bathurst (N.S.W.). The simple
annals of the place are that last year’s
vegetable crop was a failure owing to grubs,
that the fruit-trees aren’t yet in bearing, that
the irrigation plant is a failure, and that
the period of the Government sustenance
allowance is nearly run out because a Min-
istry which is financially “up against it”
can’t keep it on indefinitely. So apparently
the settlers will be left in the trap that was
prepared for them as the fabled goat was left
in the well. Possibly more experienced men
might have made a better fight with the
grubs, but again they might not. Even the
highly-trained man often finds agriculture a
path of calamity. Meantime, Sydney alone
is 4500 telephone instruments short, and
must wait till they are imported, and pre-
sumably paid for with loan money, because
the country doesn't learn this sort of highly-
paid work. Instead, the men who fought
its battles and made its name world-famous
are struggling with debt and grub-eaten cauli-
flowers out in Knowhere.
As the law requires an interval of 18
months at least between each liquor referen-
dum in Vic., there will be no local-option
poll in connection with the rush election on
August 30. For this relief Bung and many
others are holding thanksgiving services.
Some returned soldiers who don’t know
anything about the land have sense enough
to keep away from it. Certain of them in
Melbourne, having done a spell of vocational
training, have started a co-operative factory
at Collingwood, where the drought and the
bush-fire are not, for making art-metal, silver
and electro-plated ware. At first they sold
to middlemen, but when they discovered
their 245. cakestand ticketed at 655. they de-
cided to try trading direct. It was Vic-
torian soldiers who founded the Anzac tweed
industry; possibly the State’s old Protec-
tionist tradition gives them a bent that way.
Meanwhile N. S. Wales is still waiting for
further news about that co-operative woollen
enterprise which Sydney union organisers
were to start, quite a long time ago, in old
Parramatta gaol, handed over by the Govern-
ment on “satisfactory terms.”
The value of exports from the U.S.A. has
shrunk to less than half what it w T as in the
middle of last year, and even later than that.
In October the total was about 750 million
dollars; in April it was under 350 millions.
Uncle Sam explains it by saying that Europe
can’t afford to buy, and he tries to get com-
fort out of the reflection that, while he kept
out of the war, he got the other countries’
gold. In private, however, he begins to
wonder whether the performance w r ns so bril-
liant as he thought it was at the time, and
for two or three years afterwards. He’s the
lady who made a living by taking in her
neighbors’ washing. Then he seized the
chance to own the neighbors’ clothes, and now
he doesn’t know what to do with them, and
he’s got no washing-bills to collect either.
The longer it lasts the less the solid men
of the N.S.W. Assembly like the system of
proportional representation. Under that
system every district has three members at
least. In practice it works out that the
three or rqpre are competitors for public
favor; and the only way the favor of many
electors can be got is. by winning something
for them from the State. So practically the
new system is a competition among three or
four members to decide which can wheedle
or drag or bully or bribe the most out of the
Ministers and their officers. The principle
of proportional representation is sound
enough; but in the present demoralised state
of the electorate it is, unfortunately, a help
to still further demoralisation. Apparently
there is no real hope for the country until
the people can be got to realise that they
are the State —every man Jack and Bill of
them.
IN MEMORIAM: THOMAS JOSEPH RYAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Friend of the heart sincere, and brother wise,
Who now, unwilling, rests upon the hill
Where broken shafts and monuments arise,
And pallid crosses glimmer to the stars,
AVhen the night-winds are still:
The dim cathedral echoes to the choir
That chanted dolor for untimely death,
Sorrow for him who is a quenched fire —
Of his land’s gracious bosom made as or.e ;
As a child, slumbereth.
The striving city hushed to see him pass;
Hushed all the loving thousands whom lie knew, t
Kre from his high estate he drooped as grass
That dies in time as he untimely dies.
The steadfast and the true.
Down to the dark Australia’s Great Son falters
Glowing with life, yet forced to take repose ;
Foregoing aims that Fate the Slayer alters,
And leaving anguish in the heart of beauty
And ashes on the rose.
Through the hushed streets that heard him praised
of people
The silent slow procession fares along,
'the bells of death tolling from tower and' steeple
Their sorrow for a just man leached from life,
And a dirge made of song ;
Whom frosty winter in the icy south
Waylaid with Death and gave Death all his will,
Stilled the great heart and silent made the mouth —
He that for generous summer could not wait
And now is cold and still.
Here on this hill of funeral urns and crosses
Ends that good life of counsel strong and wise;
Golgotha, the cold field of human losses,
Claiming, untimely, Singlehcart our brother
As costly sacrifice.
Happy and brave was he, as this our land ;
The crime of his untimely. death is done;
The strong heart very still; the high head low
With its ideals; and the smiling eyes
All darkened to the sun.
No more the ‘forum knows him ; and his place
Within the nation’s counsels empty is;
No more his three beloved see his face ;
Vor in the dear sanctuary of home
Shall bless him with a kiss.
Bettered our land by' him who now is dust;
Better are we for that he passed our way ;
The strong, beloved, kindly mate, and just,
Who now hath left the race ere it was run
And there were hours of day ;
Who now is taken from the field at noon,
Untimely slain ere age or weakness mars;
Upon whose hillside-grave looks down the moon ;
Though his high spirit shines upon us still
In glances from the stars.
QUEENSLAND.

For the first time since '92 the Commercial
of Australia is paying a dividend on its
ordinaries. Last year the directors found
themselves in a dilemma ; business had'grown
so rapidly that the bank’s live capital (in-
cluding converted deposits) was too small
to carry it, judging by accepted standards.
However, there were difficulties in the way
of getting new capital. There were 211,735
£lO prefs. fully paid and 191,318 19s. ordin-
aries. But the troubles of the ’nineties were
still with the co., and, owing to the deficiency
in the Special Assets Trust which had
handled the old wreckage, in June last year
there were no visible assets to represent any
of the ordinary capital or £330,743 of the
pref. capital. The directors were faced with
the further difficulty of formulating a capital-
raising scheme which would be approved by
both classes of shareholders. On paper the
prefs. had the preponderance of voting
strength; each £lO-paid pref. and each 10s.-
paid ordinary carried the same voting power,
and there were 20,417 more of the former.
The directors finally came forward with a
proposal to issue 403,054 new ordinaries of
10s. each at a 100 p.c. premium, allowing
both prefs. and ordinaries to take up one
share of the new issue for each share then
held. Though this scheme gave only slender
concessions, if any at all, to the old depositors
whose money had kept the bank going and
got it to the stage of again feeding ordinaries,
sufficient scrip had been mobilised to carry it
into effect. The Bulletin has already dealt
fully with the scheme (“Wild Cat,”
11/11/’2O) ; some of the effects can now be
examined.
To June 30 last 259.713 of the 403,054
ordinaries offered had been taken up and
were in various stages of payment: they ha<(
contributed £100,059 of new capital. In addi-
tion they had provided a similar amount in
premiums, and the whole of the latter was
used to write down the outstanding loss on
realisation of old assets. In addition,
£135.000 of the year’s disclosed profits went
to fill the same hole. The introductory table
does not regard the old losses as deficit, but.
a truer view of the present position of the
hank is afforded by this table

80 during the 12, months the deficit has been
got down from £426,402 to £187,079, the
amount still to he made good being only
one-fifth of that shown 10 years ago. Pro-
vided everything continues to go well, within
another two or three years the whole of the
old troubles should be swept away. At pre-
sent, however, there are visible , assets to
represent only £14,039 of the £202,318 of
ordinary capital paid up. But, notwithstand-
ing that only slightly more than £7 of every
£lOO of ordinary capital is covered by assets
in the published accounts, a 15 p.c. dividend
(not for the full year, though) is being paid
on it. It is an extraordinary position. No
reputable public concern would willingly
pay a dividend under such circum-
stances. But the co. was in an awk-
ward position: it had to raise funds,
and the required capital certainly would
not have been forthcoming if share-
holders had been told that they would have
to wait some years before any div. would he
declared. It was a case of needs must when
the. Devil drives. Of course, owing, to the
100 p.c. premium paid on the new issue, a
15 p.c. on those shares is really only a 71
p.c. div. But, strictly, the dividend will
represent so much profit which should not
be leaving the bank until the whole of its
capital is made good. The Bulletin pointed
out on several occasions that there was a
satisfactory way of overcoming the difficulty
—writing down prefs.’ capital and giving
them slight dividend concessions. As it is,
the published accounts still show scars, the
hank is paying divs. on its ordinaries when
no div. should bp paid, and two millions or so
of its capital is at a heavy discount on the
market.
Nevertheless, the position from the point
of view of the bank’s creditors is much more
satisfactory than it was 12 months ago,
owing to the new capital got in and the pre-
miums thereon. This comparison, which also
shows how rapidly the business has ex-
panded, helps the investigation of the
changed position of the bank :

Twelve months ago the bank’s funds repre-
sented by visible assets amounted to
£1,786,(507, and its liabilities £17,064,747.
At June 30 funds had expanded to £2,131,088
and liabilities had dropped back to
£10,005,342. So. instead of £0 11s. of the
public’s money held 12 months ago for every
£ of shareholders’ live capital, under £8 is
now held. This brings the relation of liabili-
ties to funds within the limits generally re-
garded as prudent, and unless the balance-
sheet figures increase unexpectedly the calls
to be got in from the new issue will further
reduce the proportion. Looking at the posi-
tion from another angle: to protect the
£16,995,342 of liabilities there is £6,918,581
liquid and £1,429,158 advanced to finance
War Loan purchases, war gratuities and the
wheat pool. To back the £5,047,603 of de-
posits, etc., not so covered there are the
advances with a hook value of _£ 10,319,178
and premises written down to £513,775.

The sudden spring in profits—they are
£lOO,OOO or so greater than the average for
the previous six years—accompanied by the
lifting of the div. rate two points on both
classes of shares, gives to the latest accounts
of the Bank of Victoria a flush of the vari-
ety which was visible in bank balance-sheets
of the ’eighties and early ’nineties, before
the boom-timers found that they had been
living in a- fool’s paradise. It has been evi-
dent from other balance-sheets which have
been published lately that very few bankers
have deemed it prudent to regard much of
the recent exchange and other pickings as
profits-actually earned; they have, instead,
treated them as tentative profits only, avail-
able for making good losses which may
finally result from the abnormal conditions
that provided the exceptional earnings.
Banking profits are, at best, only an esti-
mate, and the wisest banker knows not,
particularly in these uncertain days, how
healthy the business which he accepted yester-
day may he in a few months’ time. It
seems .probable that the Bank of Victoria
is not taking the same size in precautions as
practically all others are; and, going a step
further, it is passing out nearly £30,000
more in divs. than it did for the preceding
twelve months. Yet Chairman Edward Miller
(the “Money” Miller family is a big influ-
ence in the concern) holds out no prospect
of profits being maintained on the present
scale: “the rates on money had begun to
fall,'' he told shareholders a few days ago,
“and it was probable that next year the
profits will not be so large.”
Further light is thrown on the subject of
profits by this comparison :

From those figures it is possible to guess
how much more big, old concerns like the
Wales and Commercial of Sydney could have
diseased had their managements decided to
display the full extent of recent apparent
earnings. The prefs. share with the ordi-
naries in the increased divs. The former are
the one-fifth of old deposits which were con-
verted into scrip after the ’93 smash. They
carry 5 p.c. pref., but follow the ordinaries
point for point. It was also arranged that
after they have had 7 p.c. for five consecu-
tive years they lose their preferential rights
as to divs., their first call on capital remain-
ing until the ordinaries become fully paid.
There are £41,07(5 fully-paid £lO prefs. and
212,230 £lO ordinaries paid to £3. These
tot up £1,478,010, and are assisted, by
£635,846 of visible reserves. Other balance-
sheet figures have moved in this way since
pre-war times: —

Liabilities total £11.096.993: the bank's own
funds amount to £2,113,856. So only five
guineas of the public’s money is held for
every £of funds. Owing to the recent heavy
demands for accommodation a smaller pro-
portion of liabilities is now in liquid'form :
46.6 p.c. compared with 56 p.c. 12 months
ago. Hut it is not so many years since less
than one-third of all liabilities was liquid.
In those days the banks did not have the
same inducement to hold large proportions of
the money entrusted to them in gilt-edged
securities, particularly in instances like the
Bank of Victoria, which had only a mild
proportion of outside money to help earn
dividends on shareholders’ capital. War
finance altered the position; so whereas in
1914 a quarter-million of public securities
was held and nothing was invested in Lon-
don, at the latest balance there was £839,36(5
in War Loan and State and municipal, stocks,
£868,646 in British Treasury bills and at
short-call in London, £269,508 was advanced
on behalf of the Commonwealth Government
to cash war-gratuity bonds, and £280,658
accommodation was provided clients to
finance War Loan purchase. In the table
above the latter item is not included with
liquid assets, though, in view of the un-
doubted security, it reasonably could be so
treated.

Twelve months ago the directors told share-
holders liow well the co.’s business was ex-
panding and of the success which had at-
tended the establishment of a live-stock de-
partment of the Melbourne branch. On this
occasion, however, they are silent, and the
receding of profits to the 1916 level is left to
tell its Own tale of the troubles which have
beset this and other cos. handling pastoral
produce. Gross earnings at £45.514 weie £9842
logs than for the previous year: but exes,
were not got down correspondingly. Salaries'
and wages in 1920 were £20,245, in 1921
£18,917; other exes, in 1920 were £14,837, in
1921 £15,079 —a net reduction of only £lOB6.
So there was a very slender margin available
for reserves after distributing the usual 7
p.c. div. The co. has been a disappointment.
It took over a half-century-old business nine
years ago and paid £50,000 (in scrip) for
goodwill. Average net profits lor the
last half-dozen years of the old concern were
given as £13,198 p.a. Drought gave the Vic.
western districts a severe set-back in the
co.’s first year; then war troubles intervened.
So, despite the improved earnings during the
period of abnormal prices, net profits since
the c 6. began have averaged only £13,480 p.c.
No reckless forecasts of probable profits were
made by the old owners; indeed, anticipation
of profits was left to public-accountant. E.
Becliervaise, who regarded the old average as
"probable and consistent.’ The late E. 11.
Laseelles had hacked his faith by asking no
cash for goodwill and by guaranteeing 7 p.e.
p.a. for five years on the money put up by the
public. The average net earnings since the
co. started are the poorer-looking because
after paying 7 p.c. divs. the business has
latterly been assisted by £26,000 of stored-up
profits. This shows how balance-sheet fig-
ures have moved since the first audit
1913. 1920. 1921.

Capital from the beginning has remained
stationary at £150,001). After payment of the
year’s final div. £42,848 of it was represented
by the surplus of more or less liquid assets
over liabilities, assuming stocks and book-
debts are worth all they are represented to
be in the published accounts. A further
£79,013 of capital is, covered bv the book-
value of premises, etc., and no doubt they are
nowadays worth ail that. Eight years ago the
co.’s Geelong warehouses were the most up-
to-date in the Commonwealth, and they were
taken over at below their then market value.
Machinery, plant and odds and ends stand in
the books at £3184. That leaves £24.955 of
capital (the deficit shown in the introductory
table) still not represented by tangible assets.

This co.’s capital account has undergone
some extraordinary changes during recent
years. Ten years or so ago Goodlet and
Smith’s owned numerous properties around
Sydney, but as the business- became central-
ised most of them were unloaded at prices
considerably in excess of book values. So
on two occasions in the period covered by the
table assets were written up £lO,OOll A
couple of years ago £55,00(1 of the fluo.OOU
paid capital, representing ss. of the £1 shares
paid to ,155., was returned, and every two
of the 10s. naids were converted into one £1
fully-paid. It was never possible to ascer-
tain what relation the book value of assets
bore to true -values, though, since plant had
obviously been well written down, there was
a hint that other belongings had been treated
likewise. Twelve months ago the directors
confirmed the suspicion: when threats of con-
fiscation of profits in excess of certain divi-
dend rates was being talked of, Goodlet and
Smith’s, like a lot of other people, decided to
reconstruct. First of all an independent
valuation of assets assessed them at £55,000
in excess of book values. Then the new co.
was formed, scrip being issued for this
£55,000 and also against the reserves of a
like amount shown in the published accounts.
Shareholders thus got two fully-paid £1
shares in the new co. for every one in the
old. _ _ __ .
The profits shown for the past year were
easily a record ; they were more than double
those disclosed in each of the two previous
years, higher than in the days when £55,000
more investments were helping to swell earn-
ings, and showed several thousands improve-
ment over the years when State loans created
a construction boom. The latest net profits
represented 9 p.c. on the enlarged capital,
and though the 6 p.c. to shareholders looks
mild it. means 12 p.c. on their capital prior to
the reconstruction. The return of £55.000
of capital and the present improved dividend
rate have been substantial rewards to old
holders, who for many years got only 8 p.e.
Unless the directors were communicative at
the meetings, shareholders, however, could
not have been wise to the extent to which
the business had been strengthened. Over the
10 years to 1920, apart from the £20,000
dropped in from the sale of properties, vis-
ible reserves' expanded only £1146 after pay-
ing 8 p.e. p.a. for eight years and 6 p.c.
for two. Put another way, disclosed profits
were little more than sufficient to pay the
dividends, which were on the slender side
considering the volume of reserves which
were assisting earnings. The question arises
whether the latest lot of profits can he re-
garded as the probable normal earnings for
the future. The Bulletin has doubts.
High prices, combined with industrial expan-
sion and War Service. Homes construction,
have helped recent figures. Whether build-
ing operations will be as active in the diffi-
cult years'of heavy taxation and re-adjust-
ment ahead is questionable. I-t is also fairly

Mockbell'n, Ltd.-—This little co., which
runs numerous coffee and light-luncheon
rooms in Sydney, has issued its second lot of
half-yearly accounts. Net profits are almost
£lOOO less than for the first six months, but
the directors explain that the January-June
period is “financially the lean half-year” of
the business. All except £57 of the half’s
profit of £932 is absorbed by a div. at the
rate of 10 p.c. p.a., making 121 p.c. for
the year. Altogether £2178 flowed out. and
£O5B was left - to strengthen the business.
After writing oil £317 of preliminary exes,
and providing lor the shrinkage in value of
leaseholds, a credit balance of only £9O goes
into the new P. and L. account. For good-
will £lOOO was paid, so £904 of the paid
capital of £17;5Q0 is still not represented by
tangible assets. The co.’s position was com-
fortable at June 30. It owed Only £1079
ami held War Loan and cash amounting to
£3809, and stocks with a book value of
£4854. Book debts and other more or less
liquid assets totted up £164, so the eo. had
a liquid surplus of £7248, from which £875
is now to be extracted for divs. Leaseholds
stand in the books at £2835, and furniture
and equipment at £7688.
The chief item of .interest: on this occasion,
however, is not in the accounts, but in the
directors’ report. I). K. luglis having re-
tired from the Board, it is proposed that
G. F. Foxali should filj the vacancy. At the
same time E. W. Foxali, the retiring auditor,
again offers himself for that post. So it is
proposed that Foxali, junior, should sit. in
judgment on the affairs of a concern which
Foxali, senior, is assisting to control. Inci-
dentally, other directors of Mockbell’s are
the old proprietor; C. A. White, the bread-
baker; and V. C. Barnett, Sydney manager
of Rosella Preserves. It might interest
investors to know whether the directors’
firms supply the co. with any of its require-
ments.
Oil-Shape Products and Coal, Ltd. —
This is the co. which proposes to resurrect
old Joadja, near Mittagong (N.S.W.), where
the long-defunct Australian Kerosene Oil
Co. refined for many years, but towards the
end merely shipped the richer shales to Ger-
many. For 15 years or so the old works
have been crumbling, and the area given
over to the fruitgrower. A couple of years
ago a S. Aus. crowd, headed by Thos. Leahey,
acquired the rights of a new system of re-
torting, which Ilowlette Wilson declared re-
covered oil “superior to that made from the
same shale by any other process” encoun-
tered in his 25 years’ experience. Possess-
ing an oil-winning process which looked
likely, the next problem was where it should
be put to work. The old Joadja field was
selected, and for a couple of years a little
concern, the Shale Petrol Oil Co., has had
an experimental retort there. Now it is
proposed that the Shale Petrol shall blos-
som into Oil-Shale Products and Coal, Ltd.,
with a three-quarter million nominal capi-
tal. The vendor concern is to get 135,000
fully-paids and £65,000 cash (£25,000 at once
and the balance spread over five years),
which is also to provide for the purchase of
the area from the present owners. The public
is offered 250,000 shares, to be paid to 10s.
on application, the balance of 10s. to be
got in on allotment. In S. Aus. 100,000 shares
have been placed, so it is said ; and as the
co. is to go to allotment on 50,000 the flota-
tion is evidently assured.
In addition to the old Joadja ground, min-
eral rights have been secured over an area
at Reedy Creek, four miles away; and the
co. proposes to go after coal as well as shale.
Apparently also, it intends to open up further
orchard country, which has proved, accord-
ing to the Dept, of Agriculture, “one of the
best as to productiveness in the State.”
Everything, however, depends, so far as oil
is concerned, on (1) the behavior of the bat-
tery of retorts, with a capacity of 000,000
gallons crudes per week, which the co. pro-
poses to instal at a cost of £20,000; and
(21 on the quantity and quality of shales
available. Conditions have entirely changed
since the old A.K.O. went out of business.
That concern mined vast quantities of high-
value shales at Joadja, and left untapped
considerable known reserves of lower-value
stuff which apparently did not then pay to
mine for export. The extent and quality
of shale supplies is one of the matters which
the co. will have to determine when the
new system of vertical retorting has proved
what it is capable of doing. Ilowlette Wil-
son declares that I.' ton shale can be put
through daily with the new retort, whereas
formerly it took seven days to retort two
tons, and that, since no flame is directly in
contact with the shale treated, former waste
of products is eliminated. However, the
actual value of the new system cannot be
gauged until a battery of retorts is in opera-
tion. It is a plucky undertaking, this revival
of the old field, and several vital factors
have, still to be determined before (lie future
of Oil-Shale Products and Coal, Ltd., is
assured. It starts with the advantage of
being able to get to work at a minimum of
cash outlay: the old A.K.O. Co.’s water-
mains and reservoirs are in good order, the
hauling plant and tram-line are still in
operation, some of the old buildings are
intact, and hundreds of thousands of Eng-
lish and Scottish bricks are scattered about
and available for use.

Ihe YV estralian Mines Department’s
annual report for 1920 gives belated in,forma-
tion about last year’s mining operations in
that State. Mineral output was valued
at ±0,259,411, of which 80.51 p.c. represented
gold. Divs. at £384,083 were £45,839
greater than for the previous vear. Area
1 1< 4d under leasehold for all minerals was
00,383 acres, and prospecting areas aggre-
gated 04,420 acres. In addition, temporary
reserves comprising 230,000 sq. miles were
created and rights of occupancy given on
special terms to oil-seekers and other specu-
lative people. Men employed in the in-
dustry totalled 8496. Eour goldfields
slightly increased outputs, but all others
showed decreases. The average of gold ore
treated fell in value 2.665. to 42.225., and on
the Kalgoorlie field, which produced over 64
p.c. of the whole output, the decline was
Dats. per ton to 47.025. Working costs at
dyd* tvgre up 9s. Sd. per ton compared
with 1919, and 20s. 4d. in advance of the
1914 figures. During the year 117 prospec-
tors were assisted, and £4OOO was voted to
them; assistance was also given claim-holders
under the Mines Development Act. ,
* * * *
Tara Syndicate, whose shares sold readily
at up to £5O during the Hamilton boom, paid
a first and final div. of 9s. 6d. the other day.
The co. had bad luck from the start. Its
fust venture at Broad Arrow, which showed
good returns in the hands of prospectors
was soon pronounced a failure; but since
Tara gave up good returns have again been
obtained by the present owners. Leaving
Hi olid Arrow a move was made, iu company
with Borland and Rudd’s syndicate, to
Hampton Plains, where the Mutooroo Kortli
leases were jointly optioned. When' rich
developments in the adjoining Mutooroo
showed up the northern blocks were looked
upon by experts as prospective prize
packets; but further work proved the area
a blank.
* * •* *
Great Boulder has sampled the new find
m the Lake View South (W.A.), but is not
likely to acquire the show. The price asked
is considerably more than Boulder is pre-
pared to pay. Reports of rich developments
in the bottom of the adjoining Lake View
mine are denied by manager Vail ; neverthe-
less he has hopes of getting something there
before long.
* * * *
Here is an illuminating extract from the
official report of Ives’ Reward meeting at
which the inspection-reports by directors
Wimams and Dr. Russell were presented:—
Dr. Russell indignantly repudiated the rumor that
the samples he had brought back, and which assayed
.\ 45 ai ' c J 5 J dwt. respectively, were specialiy
picked He had taken them himself at, random
from the heaps at night, without assistance from
anyone, and even had he desired to pick them he
had not the necessary technical knowledge to enable
“ t°. do • ?0 - ••- He had personally measured the
’ etween No - 8 an , d No - 4 shafts and estimated
that the ore exposed showed a clear profit.
Having heard a director without technical
knowledge on the subject of assay values
and profit in sight, shareholders are now
anxiously awaiting the report of Giblin, who
has technical knowledge and knows some-
thing about mine valuation.
* * *
Although negotiations for the purchase of
the Carbine mine (W.A.) by White Hope
°f- 11 H ?, mpton Plains - failed, both sides are
stnl throwing out feelers. At present the
greed of the taxing authorities is the stum-
bling block. Even if the owners got the
price originally asked they would, after pay-
ing taxation, have little more than the cost
of the plant and equipment for themselves.
I ntil the inc.dence of taxation is altered
deals in gold-mines in the West are likely
to be very few.
Before big John McWhae trips oft' to
I’eter Mcßryde s job as Agent-General, he
will have to drop a few tears over his pet,
the Philippine dredging show. One of its
four plants is dismantled and stored; two
are in the hands of caretakers; and the
fourth has been tearing into such hard stuff
that the buckets would be better scrapped
than kept on the band. Teredos borers
have about finished No. o pontoon, so it, too,
will have to go into store. Funds are
equally groggy, for while No. 2 plant netted
£5774 on working account, half of that
went in royalty to the Paracale Co. So
only £2740 got into the P. and L. account
There expenses, interest, fees and other odd-
>dents changed the credit into a loss of
£6638, to be added to the debit of £23,902
brought forward. This is not the sort of
thing to suit the digestion of the fatmen
debenture holders, who look blue over their
advances of £41,400. The chief dependable
assets are Nos. 2 and 4 dredges, and they
stand in the books at £23,985 and £10,339
respectively. The co. holds 97,075 shares
of £1 each in the Paracale Bucket
Dredging, Ltd., and 3750 shares in the
Paracale Kiver Dredging Co. But when
the post-mortem ist finds that the Para-
cale Bucket Co. owes £1.0,547 and
that the Paracale Kiver is owed
£10,651, one gets fuzzy in trying to take
out a balance. Manager Telford pitches
his yarn in the minor key and leaves to
John McWhae the job of retailing how want
of firewood, high prices for materials and
spares, and scarcity of labor tangled up the
whole bag of tricks. With one plant Tel-
ford got up to 4900 z. in May and June, but
having worked out the good patch he must
cut back through old tailings to try for
virgin ground ahead. There the ’ clay-
breaker will settle whether the whole thing
is a dud. The outlook is made the more
wintry by McWhae’s inability to place the
plants on any decent shows elsewhere.

High costs must be the lot of Bendigo
Amalgamated if it treats only 6753 tons
monthly. That was the July output, but
the yield of 292540 z. was sweetened all
round by cleanings from the plates. At
the Constellation the average jumped from
74dwt. to 15dwt.; but the tonnage was
small—only 948 tons. Carlisle and Unity
have now to bear the cross, the stone from
the first-named keeping at about an Bdwt.
average, with Unity lumbering along in the
rear on 4dwt. stuff. Work goes on at 13
shafts, but developments do not count for
much. Unity has all the stone out on the
sill floor at 1255 ft. south, but better stuff
shows 36ft. above the level. Carlisle is
breaking down spurs on the Victory run of
stone, and will be able to extend operations
as soon as filling can get ahead. Hercules
may come into the ruck, for better prospects
are being got at 1440 ft. The Great Northern,
which has been one of Dyason’s disappoint-
ments, is to have further attention.
South Australian Oil Wells Co. has taken
an option over a borehole between Mouta-
jup and Ilunkeld railway stations, not far
from Hamilton (Vic.). For about three
months one McLellan, a water-borer, has
been drilling through basalt with an ordi-
nary drill and reached 170 ft. in sand. The
co. sent its mining manager, H. C. Dod,
from Tantanoola (S.A.), to take samples. It
is now declared that the sand .contains petro-
leum, and the co. at time of writing has been
busy securing boring options from private
landowners in the vicinity of McLellan’s
bore before making public the analyses of
the samples. If they are petroliferous, drill-
ing with a proper rig of tools will be con-
ducted, and the S.A. Oil Wells Co.’s plant
will be shifted from Tantanoola to Mouta-
jup. Most of the land near by is held under
old titles, so the Mining on Private Property
Act does not operate, and oil seekers must
deal with private landholders. It is too early
yet to get excited about the discovery.
A trial crushing from the underhand stope
at the 145 ft. level in Mt. Dudley (N.S.W.)
gave 103 oz. off the plates from 39" tons, so the
little lot went at least 3oz. to the ton. Mana-
ger Delohery is now at work to see if this
better shoot lives down to 195 ft., and about
40ft. of driving should disclose whether the
disappointing show has at last something
Worth while.

Gyrnpie (Q.) gold returns will sag lower
still as a result of the shareholders’ decision
to close down at the Columbia Extended and
the No. 2 North Columbia and Smithfield.
The cos. for some time have been putting
more money into prospecting work than they
have got out of the mines, but nothing worth
while has turned up. Next to Scottish Gym-
pie those two cos. have been the biggest pro-
dUcers recently. The Extended leaves a 2ft.
leer at loCUti., ai.d although the country
carries plumbago there is very little gold
in it.
Geologist Morton, of the Queensland Mines
Department, who has been keeping an eye on
the Nor man by field, has recently reported on
its prospects. He considers them good, but
there is no margin for serious blunders. The
opinion expressed in the "Wild Cat” some
time back that the field was not likely to be
another Charters 1 towers is continued, as the
reefs, though rich, are on the small side. The
field must have a good road and a central
battery. The best shows appear to be the
Billy Hughes and the Ross Smith, though
there are about a dozen others with inviting
prospects. Good stone can be picked up in so
many localities that it is likely further pay-
able reefs will be unearthed by prospecting.
Since the Chillagoe works re-started the
Griffiths, Christmas Gift and Girofia, at Mun-
gana, and the Paisley, at Muldiva, have all
been manned, in addition to the Einasleigh
State, mine. There have been good develop-
ments at tin* Girofia, where the crosscut at
No. 3 level proved 24ft. of lode assaying 10
p.c. lead and lOoz. silver.
Evidence of the set-back to the Blair Athol
(Q.f coalfield early this year is given in the
figures of coal won: month, of January,
10,300 tons: May, o"U(l tons. The biggest
producers, Blair Athol No. 1 and Newcastle
East, are mining only about one-third of
their former outputs. Export trade should
brighten up the field in the next few months.
* * * *
A Tokio coal magnate recently visited the
Blair Athol mines (Q.) and was so much im-
pressed with the size (it is one of the thickest
bituminous seams in the world) and qunJ't.i of
the coal that he is declared to be considering
the question of drawing supplies thence for
Japan, despite the high shipping freights.
Hie impression is that if rail freight and
loading-costs can be cut a trifle Nippon will
be a customer.

SOCIETY
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : This is the jubilee;
year -of the Government Savings Bank of
X. S. Wales, known in the beginning as the
Post Office Savings Bank. The first deposi-
tor's book issued is in the possession of Dr.
Frank Doak, of Mosman, whose father, the
late A. ,T. Doak, was the original manager.
The first teller was Arthur U. Docker,
one-time an Albert Club cricketer, who, after
living in England for some years, recently
re-visited Sydney. The earliest approaejj
to a savings bank in Australia was a pri-
vate institution, established in 1817—the
year “The Noo South” was started —by
'Robert Campbell, the father of Australian
commerce, who, to induce the prison popula-
tion of those days to lay aside what little
they might earn by extra labor or by gratui-
ties' for good conduct, ODened a sort of Lilli-
putian bank for the receipt of deposits, on
which he allowed interest at 71 or 8 per
cent. The prisoners’ money, on the arrival
of each ship, was handed over, Avith the
Governor’s consent, to Campbell, whose scheme
became known as “The Prisoners’ Bank.’
The superintendent of com’icts, one William
Hutchinson, also “banked” convict money,
but he allowed no interest, and held the
deposits so tight that it used to be a tough
job to get him to let go his grip. In the first
’thirties', George Wilier, a commissariat
clerk, put forth the idea of a savings bank
with Government recognition, and from it
sprang the Barrack-street Savings Bank.
Miller was made the first manager, and to
him were transferred the Campbell and
Hutchinson moneys. ,
“Albatross” ■: These lawyers make me gasp.
Take Curtis, of the Crown Law Office of the
Ma State. In the Fitzroy case, after eulo-
gising Johannsen, A. 8., one of the survivors,

walking nine miles for assistance, Curtis
burst forth: “This man should be given his
master’s certificate without sitting for ex-
amination.” If this were made the test few
of us would pass. One of the best ship-
masters I know cannot swim a stroke; and
as for walking nine miles—well, he is a
martyr to rheumatism. Johannsen, A. 8..
saved his own life by his wonderful powers of
endurance. 1 know dozens of law clerks and
students who helped to save other people’s
lives at the risk of their own —including those
of the solicitors and barristers who stayed
at home —and their powers of endurance
against great odds shine in the annals 6f the
A.I.F. Some of them have even lost.limbs
lighting for the stay-at-homes. But what
lawyer has suggested melodramatically or
otherwise that these men should be made bar-
risters or solicitors without examination?
“Xavillus” gives a war-time vignette:—
Bluff goes a long way sometimes. The stall'
sergeant-major of Ahyssia Detention Barracks
(Egypt) spent an hour in the gymnasium every-
day, weighed close on list, without any fat —and
packed a big Webley pistol. His job was to pacify
recalcitrant boarders. Close on 200 Australians
had been doubling in the sun for over an
hour under the charge of a warder miscalled a ser-
geant, when the word passed along to the front
four: “Next time he says double, don't, do it.” On
the order “Double march” being given the parade
kept walking. The sergeant took the names of the
front four and put them at the rear. The next
time the order was given the whole parade halted.
The men were beginning to look nasty, and the
sergeant grew nervous, for the staff was a small
one. He blew his whistle with pasty lips, and the
big S.M. strolled put on to the parade ground. As
he advanced he jerked his holster, rpund to the
front, unbuttoned the flap, and when within about
10 yards of the head of the column, still drawn
up in a rough formation of fours, he halted,' drew
the revolver and said: “Now, men, refusal to obey
an order is mutiny, and for the safety of all strong
measures must be employed. When 1 say ‘Double
march' I intend to aim id the nearest man of the
HIS HELPMATE.
“I suppose, now, Professor, you tell your wife every thing. ”
“I don’t need to. I tell her about a quarter, and site multiplies it by ten.”
front four. If you don’t double I will shoot him
at once, and then in succession the other three of
the front four and the two nearest*of the next four.
At least three out of the six are certain to go
before you can get to me. You win after, but three
or four of your cobbers are dead.” Then he took
deliberate aim at the nearest man of the first four
and barked, “Double march!” The parade started
like clock-work.
‘‘Burglar’s Laborer” : Re prison treatment
(B. 2S/7/’2l) in N. S. Wales. No writer
has so far mentioned the appointment in
X.K.W. gaols of a. “prisoners delegate” to
the cookhouse. His job is to see that the
prisoners get a fair deal as to food. But
instead of being elected, as he should be if
he is to exist at all, he is appointed by the
chief warder; and usually lie is content to
be a mere ornament. During a day’s ex-
perience in the job I upset all precedents bv
drawing attention to the fact that so much
bone and fat was on some of the plates that
the meat was a mere mouthful. The gaol
governor came down to investigate; and I
understand an inquiry decided that some of
the warders were getting away with hunks
of meat that should have gone to the
boarders. That sort of thing seems in-
separable from a gaol system under which
the men in charge of the prisoners are often
more human than humane, and in which the
alleged representative of the prisoners too
often wishes to take a nice job easily without
causing offence.

“Cam-shaft”: It was a lightning-flasli of
reason that enabled Frank Green, a machinist
in a West Melbourne coach factory, to dodge
death the other day when his clothing got
caught in the coup-
ling of a revolving
shaft. Green had
gymnastic tr a i u-
ing, and he took
less than a second
to decide. Although
the shaft was doing
300 revolutions to
the minu t e, lit'
grip p c d it as
though it was a
horizontal bar and
was whirled round.

pants around his

sonal injuries were merely bruises and shock.
“Ex-Dig.”: Among those who became ab-
sentees from the= A.I.F. were a surprising
number of officers; and you could understand
it. A number vf'ere mere youngsters, and
when they attained the glory of their pips
the desire to swank for a while before return-
ing to thi> fate that waited for an amazing
proportion of newly-made omcers was power-
fal. Some of the absentees, after a gay whirl,
returned stony broke and prepared to face
the fate aforesaid cheerfully; but others
found that English snobbery made things so
delightfully ea.sy for the man with pips on his
shoulders that they stayed absent. One man
who attained senior rank had a. spasm of
a.w.l. after each promotion. There were even
a few chaplains among the absentees. I don’t
know what they did durinv their periods of
straying, but one, when he reported back,
brought a nicely-robed bride to help make his
excuse. The lady was also richly cashed;
and that Digger is not chaplaining any more.
“Grlisy” : “Esmee” (B. 21/7/’2l) on Hun
wit reminds me of an incident wherein Fritz's
humor nroved liis undoing. In 1916 the
British couldn’t fathom the Hun’s movements
of troops in sympathy with those in opposite
trenches. Our units, withdrawn to other
sectors ostensibly for a spell, invariably
found opposite them again, after a few days,
the same Hun regiments, which had ap-
parently been sent thither for a similar pur-
pose, viz., a spell in a quiet sector. Then
the Great Australian Thirst stepped in. One
of our co. commanders rang up Batt. 11. Q.,
inquired for the adjutant, and asked if he
would send up Capt. Blank a bottle of whisky
by the next runner. The bottle duly
arrived, and was promptly disposed of during
the night. At daylight next morning the Dig-
gers were astonished to see a huge placard
above the Boche trenches: “Did ('apt. Blank
get his bottle of whisky last night?” The
SHE DIDN’T FEEL HOPELESS
ABOUT IT.
"This is our thirteenth quarrel! Perhaps we
shall never have another!”
"Oh, Em not in the least superstitious?"
co. roll was quickly called and every man
answered his name, leaving' Blank astounded,
lie reported the incident, which went through
to Division, and he was instructed to raid
the Boche outposts during the coming dark-
ness. The raid proved a success, the party
returning with it listening set, with valves
and amplifier complete, thus showing how
Blank’s conversation had been picked up by
the Hun 'through leakage from ground lines.
The outcome was the outwitting of Fritz in
1917, for 2000 British listening sets were
strewn along the line, and they were a big
improvement: on the Hun’s.
“Sixenate”: Death has a habit of stealing
a march upon some of its victims. At Lith-
gow the other day a man, who had been look-
ing upon the beer when it was amber, fell
face downwards into a drain containing about
an inch of water. When he was found he
was dead —drowned. In the Taranaki dis-
trict (MX.) a farmer, driving home, was
jolted from his buggy sis lie was crossing a
creek, and, striking his head against a
boulder, lay stunned. There were only a
few inches of water running in the creek ; but
the farmer was a drowned man when they
found him next day.

“Bi.” : How’s this for a Scotch monopoly?
C. McDonald made out a telegraph money-
order payable to Mrs. C. McDonald, and ten-
dered it at the issuing office to another C.
McDonald (no relation). It was telegraphed
by this McDonald to a Gippsland town, and
the wire was received by another officer
named J. McDonald, who shortly afterwards
effected the payment of the order tb Mrs. C.
McDonald. 1 wouldn’t swear that the tele-
graph messenger wasn’t a red-headed Scot
named McDonald, but I can vouch for the
rest, as I was one of the clan to take part in
the transaction.
A warning from Macquarie-street:—
It seems pretty plain from the number of cases of
tetanus that have occurred lately in Sydney and in
country towns, that the disease is largely on the
increase, and, so far as I know, no serious attempt
has been made by the doctors to check its ravages.
I have read in the newspapers of a dozen or
more fatal cases during the last six months.
Patients who are likely to develop it from getting a
bit of glass, a rusty nail or a bit of old iron run
into their feet are not, as a rule, told a word about,
the danger; the wound is simply dressed, and the
patient probably not seen again—until an urgent
summons a week afterwards marks the onset of the
dreaded spasms. There is not much to be gained by
using anti-tetanic serum then; the thing is to use
it at the time of the wounding. In France, during
the war, every Digger as soon as he had a wound
from a shell got a prophylactic dose of serum, and
sometimes two or three, from over-zealous doctors,
until, in order to prevent such mistakes, a cross was
made with an indelible pencil on the forehead of
the wounded man who had been doctored. So
tetanus was almost wiped out, and the cases that
did occur were mild and recovered. There are too
many deaths from this cause in N.S.W., and the
waste of life could be entirely prevented. The serum,
by the way. is made in Melbourne.
JULY-AUGUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The willow sitting by the way
Stales bleakly out above his beard,
And with invisible hands and weird
Plucks at it fretfully all the day.
The starveling plane-tree standing by,
In her thin flapping rags of brown
And worn-out cap with tasselled crown,
I legs with stark fingers to the sky.
I would that I knew how to tell
These two the sounds that come to me
Oi future joys planned secretly—
This morn the grey thrush tuned his bell !
Then hidden away he softly tried
If lie could still with ease remember
That lovely song of last September,
And hinnmed it three times more for pride.
While glad of the wild lanlana cover,
Rehearsed the wagtail what lie would say
Over and over, tender and gay—
Nixi. week perhaps—to his little lover.
And the peewit, hurrying into the blue,
Could not bear to wait to tie out of hearing
Kve he sang out loud, “The Spring is nearing!".
Did the willow not hear and the plane-tree too?

“Howitzer” : A Digger, in London,
in 1617, dodged the authorities by rigging
himself out as a parson. lie was successful
in collecting a good many marriage fees, too.

“W.C.C.W.” : Purves was not the only mem-
ber of the Vic. Bar to be discomfited by a
witness. Sharp-tongued Davie Gaunson, in
the I'rahran Court, once noticed that the
shirt of a hostile witness had obviously not
been to the laundry for some considerable
time. "How long do you wear your linen V"
Davie barked. He was staggered when the
witness pertly told him just how far down
his anatomy it reached.
THE OYSTER AND THE PERIL.
"Is Mabel married?"
"Don't know. She's very reserved —she
never speaks about her troubles."
“Fax” : The death of a conspicuous mem-
ber of Parliament is invariably an occasion
for unconsciously humorous remarks by
political brethren who feel the shock. Quite
recently Cook referred to the passing out
of his jovial friend Page as though death
was not in order when it claimed a political
personage. Such calamities stagger us, or
words to that effect: they take us by sur-
prise ; they daze us. “We are,” said Joseph.
in so many words, “made to feel that the
■J. Ryan, and the astonishment of Cook was
fate which has overtaken one member of
this honorable House may possibly overtake
more than one of us. It is even possible for
all of us to die.” And he proceeded to sug-
gest that the sudden death of politicians was
strangely inconsistent with their godlike
positions, and ought to bo put a stop to as
A FAMILY ROW.
“That'll show yer! Yer own flesh-an'-blood! 'Er own aunt, an' she won't spring me
a sixpence! She don't care no more fer 'er relatives than fer the dirt on 'cr
neck!"
soon as possible. Then came the end of T.
greatly increased. "These visitations are
most mysterious,'' said Cook to an inter-
viewer, who - stupid fellow ! —didn’t ask him
to explain where the mystery came in. At
about the same time that Cook was. profess-
ing his inability to understand why on earth
people in his own line of business should be
singled out for decease, John Storey was be-
ing interviewed in Sydney on the same sub-
ject. Said Storey: “I cannot visualise such
a happening. It seems, impossible.” These
unconscious humorists! The_ average man,
not having to live in the politician’s artificial
atmosphere of humbug and make-believe, put
it quite differently.. When he read that
Ryan had pneumonia -a tiling any man
might have —he said : “Hum, that’s bad. He’s
a goner. I’m afraid,”

“Murkah”: About the best thing in the
history of Australian Radio is being accom-
■plished between Melbourne and
Hobart. One of the cables con-
necting the Speck with the
mainland parted. With a full
head of steam behind his 600-
metre wave, Melbourne Radio
“went to” Hobart with a chain
of telegrams. Also, by a sys-
tem of “remote control” a small
but very efficient 2000-metre
ei>ntinuous-wave set at Collins
House was worked by an opera-
tor at Melbourne Radio. Act-
ing under instructions from Mel-
bourne two receiving sets, one
tuned to 600 metres and one to
2000 metres, were joined to the
aerial at Hobart Radio. Thanks
to tuning, the two rivers of
messages from Melbourne,
though received on the one
aerial, went to their own re-
ceivers without confusion.
Thus, going to Hobart three
ways (two radio and one cable),
the business is being easily held. The
Radio branch, which languished sadly under
naval control, has advanced greatly under the
P.M.G. This is. one,of the proofs.
* *■ * *
“Lex”: A case has just been decided in
England which drives another nail in the
coffin of the speculative solicitor and the
layman with a flair for libels. One Buck-
master, husband of Gladys Cooper, the act-
ress, brought an action against the writer of
a play in which reference was made to “that
cad Buckminster.” The jury gave him a
farthing damages. Ever since the famous
Jones case, in which a writer Avas penalised
for creating a character which eolofably re-
sembled someone of whom defendant had
never even heard, the Courts have been
growing more and more unsympathetic to-
wards obscurities who identify themselves
in books and plays. Sometimes, as in the
Buckmaster suit, the plaintiff is genuinel.v
aggrieved, believing that a slight has been
intended. But oftener a chance resemblance
is seized on—usually at the instigation of an
attorney who proposes to run the case on a
profit-sharing basis—and exploited 'as certain
workers exploit “football knees” and the
like under the Employers’ Liability Act.
Identification is complete for this class of libel
if a couple of friends can swear that they
understood the ••-plaintiff to be indicated by
the paragraph or phrase forming the basis
of the claim. But there is hardly any charac-
ter in book, play or short-story which cannot
be. fitted wholly, of in part, on someone ; and
some characters (the central figure in “The
Egoist,” for example) contain basic qualities
which distinguish nearly everybody. Lewis
Waller told the writer that some hundreds of
American actors were affronted by the bus-
kers in “The Belle of New York,” consider-
ing that these hilarious figures were copies
of themselves, Ilis point was that every
outstanding figure of fiction, no matter how
grotesque, closely resembled someone in real
life. In other words, under the English law
of libel, strictly administered, no imaginative
author would be safe. It is this absurd situ-
ation that the commonsense of the Judges
and juries has been knocking on the head.
“Booleroo”: “Gregor’s” (B. 21/7/’2l)
statement that “the prevailing medical
opinion is that over 80 per cent, of persons
are born with the T.B. organism in their
system” is a bit over the odds. Admittedly
80 to 00 per cent, of people are infected
with T.B. in infapey or early childhood, but
the only common infectious disease trans-
mitted to the infant before birth is syphilis.
Gonorrhoea may be communicated to the in-
fant during the birth process, this latter
occurrence doing much to populate our blind
asylums.

“M.D.” on inoculation against typhoid :
During the war the number of cases of typhoid
in the Australian ranks was almost negligible, thanks
to a free use of vaccine. It is high time this laud-
able experiment in preventive medicine was extended
to civilians, especially those who inhabit crowded
city areas that have bad reputations with regard to
this disease. The need for it is the greater because
of the menace of the “carriers,” who are capable of
infecting healthy people, though they themselves may
have been discharged as convalescents three or four
years previously. A case has been cited in which
the carrier infected 14 healthy people, four of them
dying. The germs are harbored in billions in the
gall-bladder. Nurses, especially probationers who
have to win their spurs in typhoid wards, stand in
great need of protective inoculation, and hospitals
would do well to follow the example of Melbourne
Hospital, where they are inoculated during the lirst
four weeks of duty. It is consolatory to note that
only 2 per cent, of discharged typhoids ari carriers,
but that proportion is quite sufficient to do incal-
culable mischief, 40 to 50 per cent, of Now York
cases being traceable to this source.
Where the village .smithy stood:
On the corner of Reiby-lane and' Arbitration-street,
near Circular Quay, Sydney, stands a large bulk
store which has .just changed owners at £29,000.
On this spot Francis Cox, father-in-law of \V. C.
Wentworth, had his snjithy, and close by was Fa-
tally House, built by Thomas lteiby—a house which
later became the first home of the Bank of N. S.
Wales (1817). The Historical Society has placed a
commemorative tablet on the building fronting Mac-
quarie-place. Cox's smithy stood until comparative!■■
i ecent years, when Barney Byrne had his coalyayd
there. Cox arrived from Staffordshire in the 1790’5;
bis name is to be found in old records as a contrac-
tor'for iron work. He died on June, 1831, aged 80,
leaving three daughters, Mrs. \\ entwroth, Afts. llich-
ard Hill and Airs. Bloodsworth, of whom the first-'
named was the last to go west. Mrs. Cox (her
Frazer) died in the Hill, cottage, which acts as a
buttress to the Australian Club house at the corner
of Bent and Macquarie streets. Wentworth promised
Cox's English relations that he would have Ids
father-in-law's remains placed in the vault at Aau-
cluse, where he himself was to be laid ; but*the obi
smith was removed from the sandhills to the South
Head Cemetery instead.

“Wilfrido”: In the Wellington (M.L.)

magistrate and two assessors were attempt-

as a member of the Bar. No, gentlemen;

“Hamer”: A Parkes (N.S.W.) woman a
few days ago was reading a letter from her
12-year-absent son announcing that he was
returning home on a wsit, wnen a telegram
arrived stating that he had been killed.
Which reminds me of an A.I.F. soldier
named llodgeus. lie left his home in N. S.
Wales as a youngster, and had been absent
for 10 years when he wrote from N.Q. to say
he was returning for a holiday. But floods
cut him off, and then the repairing of the
damages they had caused to his fortunes
held him back _ Three years later he was
actually on his way lmmc when an accident
on board ship caused him to he put ashore at
Rockhampton. His spell in hospital having
wiped out the chance of a holiday, he went
back to his work. The war broke out when
he was again projecting a trip home; find he
enlisted, and went away without finding a
chance to pay the much deferred visit. Going
through the war safely, he used to speak on
the homing transport about a visit to the old
people being the first item on his pro-
gramme. He had handed in a telegram to
the home folk to be sent ashore at Fre-
mantle, when, within a day’s journey of Aus-
tralia, he fell down the stairs leading to his
mess-deck, and—finish !

Those gorgeous palaces of stucco ever

Sometimes at night I gaze at. them with awe .
The dreariest street is drunken with their light,

Where people with Gargantuan passions live,

At Hairy Mick or Tarzan of the Apes.

As "lias the horse a soul?” or “Should a wife

While awe-struck flappers ask, in accents hushed.
The question “Did she fall, or was she pushed?
It' seems an art too far beyond our ken;
We have not brains or power enough to batch
Such monkeys, vampires, moral codes and men
From our poor sparsely-sown potato-patch!
We could not help gay Charles and golden Mary at
Their task of lifting up the proletariat!
Then let us pluck the perfect fruit and shriek
With laughter when the custard-pie-is thrown,

For visions of a richer world than ours.

On Sunday the nurses at Sydney Hospital
did the last offices for Ilose Creal, their
matron for 24 years, and thousands of her
old patients and Digger pals added their tri-
bute of tears. Matron Creal had been asso-
ciated with the hospital since 1889, and few
N. S. Wales women were better known.
After the Armistice George V. decorated her
with a Royal Red Cross of the first-class for
her work as principal matron of No. 2 Mili-
tary District and of No. 14 A.G.H., Egypt.
The S. Australian-born Oscar Lines, who
has been appointed to follow John Russell
French as g.m. of the Bank of N. S. Wales,
“came much under the notice of head office
while at Broken Hill during the difficult time
that followed the' bursting of the boom/’
the office-inspired paragraph says. But it
wasn’t the way Lines was cleaning up the
mess that first attracted attention. It hap-
pened during the big strike that Dick Sleath,
the men’s leader, had occasion to go into
Lines’s office. A row started somehow, and
Lines hit Sleath over the head with a ruler.
Just then every Fat Man in Australia was
aching to hit Sleath over the head with a
ruler—or a crowbar —and the man who actu-
ally did it was a hero straight away. But
times have changed. Nowadays if the unions
had leaders like Sleath the general manager
of the B.N.S.Wi. would have fewer uncom-
fortable half-hours.
Pneumonia has finished Arthur Morrison,
a son of the founder of Geelong College and
brother of “Chinese” Morrison, who passed

unpleasantness under Smuts in East Africa.
As a youth he was a notable oarsman, and
was one of the Geelong College four that
headed the river in 1886. Later on he
rowed well for Melbourne Uni. in inter-
state eights and fours. He was in Mel-
bourne a couple of months back, to help the
old school celebrate its 50th birthday.
Francis W. Bacon, of N. S. Wales, went
further west on Friday. About 20 years ago.
there was no better-known figure in Bourke
and Brewarrina than the owner of Bumble
station. Even now a test-question put to
one who professes to have spent a lifetilue
back o Bourke is: *‘Do you remember the
time when ‘Baldy’ Bacon used to drive

past he had been settled in Sydney, where
he took a keen interest in the Co-operative

From the Federal Gallery :
hven old hands accustomed to personal friendships
between political opponents were struck by Ryan's
last act in the Reps., when he shook' hands and con-
gratulated Joe Cook on his 30 years’ service in Par-
liament, just after they had been raking one another
in very warm tones. That was characteristic of
Ryan. It is r.ot a conventional epitaph, but a solemn
fact, that he had an enormous capacity for kindness.
He had been less than two years in the Federal Par-
liament, but among the officials he would have won
easily in a popularity contest, because he was excep-
tionally considerate, and never required the atten-
tions that some Ministers and private members in-
variably demand. Ryan had no particular pastime,
his only vice being an occasional flutter at the races.
I remember that just before the Cup last year he
asked me if I had the winner about me. “No,” I
said, “but you can put your shirt on Ryan for the
Prime Minister’s Stakes.” Alas, old Charon has
proved me a bad prophet.
James Cowan, retired Westralian magis-
trate; is immensely proud of being the hus-
band of an M.L.A., but it hasn’t stifled his
sense of humor. He opened the door to
one of the multitudinous callers at the
Cowan house. “Does the member for the
district live here?” the stranger asked. “No,
she doesn’t,” replied Jimmy. Then, as the
visitor turned to go—“but she sleeps here.”
Wessel’ : Darwin is the only town where
I ever had my hair cut and my bristles
shaved bv a mayor, a martyr and an O.K.F.
secretary. It sounds like a barbers’ syndi-
cate, but the three were all rolled together in
Bob Toupein, who within a week lately was
elected secretary of the Workers’ Industrial
Union of North Australia and sent to
the Fanny Bay Gaol for; 28 days for not pay-
ing his income-tax. This trip, by the way,
answers the charges of the Northern .Territor y
Times, which hinted that. Robert had been
base enough to pay his taxes. He isn’t
mayor now, but held that exalted office when
he first condescended to put the razor over
me.
Anne Thesiger, second daughter of Vis-
count Chelmsford, one-time Governor of
Queensland and N. S. Wales, is to marrv
Donough Edward Foster O’Brien, eldest soil
and heir of the 15th Baron Inchiquin, an
Irish representative peer who claims descent
from that Brian Boru, King of Meath, who
was killed at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.
Chelmsford is a modern title, the present
peer’s grandfather, Sir Fred Thesiger, who
was Lord Chancellor in 1858, being the first
baron. Donough' O’Brien is a grand-nephew
of Smith O’Brien, who spent a few years in
Tasmania for his love of Ireland. He is
connected by marriage with Marconi, the
wireless man.
David Murray, who is marked out for the
late' Bill Kearsley’s seat in N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly, is one of the Newcastle industrial-
ists who were passed out of the Railway
Department after the big strike of 1917.
Since then he has earned a living as a
jobbing painter, but has found time to be
secretary of the Eight Hour Committee, of
the Coachmakers’ Union and Newcastle re-
presentative on the N.S.W. Board of Health.
Shortly before Kearsley’s death, Murray was
offered re-employment in the railways, but
declined.
N.S.W. State Ministers Estell and Cann
lost an old friend the other day when Edwin
Farnsworth died at Bathurst. He was an
engineer who came to Australia 67 years
ago, when he was 20, joined an engineering
firm and assisted in laying out Brisbane.
Afterwards, as an engineer, he worked on the
old Redfern railway station, the Zigzag and
Sydney’s original sewerage system. He
retired 25 years ago, but found he had too
much energv left to be idle, so started
contracting. It was as a workmate that he
became friendly with the present Ministers.
Australia has lost a great scientist in
A, H. C. Zietz, of Adelaide. He was born
in Denmark 82 years back, had Haeckel as
a tutor, and came to S.A. in 1883 as a
zoologist, with medals already won in
museum work. To the Adelaide Museum he
was invaluable till his retirement in 1910.
He played a great part with Prof. Stirling
in exploring the fossil remains at Lake
Callabonna, in the building-up of a
skeleton of an immense diprotodon. Zietz
had for years lived in retirement, but
his son has been in the Adelaide Museum
from boyhood, and is a recognised authority
on bird life.
Maoriland’s Bar will not know Dr. Magina!
Manilal, the Hindu barrister who was in the
limelight during the 1919 strikes among the
indentured coolies in Fiji. The Full Court
—Sim, Hashing, Stringer, Reed and Adams
—considered his application after Chief Jus-
tice Robert Stout had hum’d and lw'd about
it, and found that Maginal had failed to
prove that he should wear the wig. Bartram
and McCombs, Labor M’s.P., tried to give
him a leg up. but they over-estimated their
lifting power. The story is told in Welling-
ton that the doctor is retiring to a Waikato
farm.
F. M. DICKENSON, who followed the late
II m. Knox as secretary of the Broken
Hill Prop., and has had the big job ever
since.
Maprilaud lost a brilliant scholar when
Eric Rowe holder of the 1857 Exhibition
Scholarship, went west in Tjoindoii
recently. He was the youngest son of a well-
known Christchurch lawyer.
Vic. Treasurer McPherson, who is in Lon-
don cannot get back till the end of Sep-
tember. Just as a Mac should, be took the
precaution before he went to leave signed
nomination papers with more than one fi-iend,
so that his Hawthorn seat would be pro-
tected in such an emergency as arose last
week.
E. Lees, C.E., whose name is, linked
with the opening up of the Croaj mgolong
country (Vic.), has driven in his last peg.
As a district surveyor he united to profes-
sional capacity a heap of common-jense. In
his pioneering work he stood up to criticism
the stalwart he was. He c/ven dared
to differ strongly from E. J. Braf/y, and vet
continue to live at Mallacoota. After all,
the pretty place was big enough for both’
and latterly they seemed to it.
Donald Sinclair, lately dead in Adelaide
at ( <S, went back to the very early clays of
South Australia. At the age of (two he was
one of a family party whieJh travelled by
bullock-dray from Mount Barker right round
by I ort Augusta to Coffin Bay ; on the far-
west coast. Sinclair was stojecn by bl-ack-
reliows as a kiddie. T.l e had McDouall
Stuart as a tutor. Crowing/ up, he owned
or managed stations in various parts, and
was for some time pastoral valuator for
Elder, Smith & Co.
Denmark (S.A.), about y.he oldest of the
lingation towns on the, J lurrav, has had
enough quick thrills to utod i a novel. A fire
m the early morning burl it down a lot of
the mam street. Next day ; “Nugget” Wright,
a returned and ‘‘gassed s *' soldier, usually
prominent in fire-fighting, was found in the
ruins. He had been mar ried only a week,
the day after that his c jate, Alan Senior,
another returned soldier-, greatly upset at
the incident, cut his thro* t fatally after giv-
ing evidence -at. the ine uest. No wonder
Renmark is humming life g a hive of bees.
Pbe name of Con WaJ llaee appeared early
among the list of applif ;ants for the Labor
nomination at West Sy dnev, the late T. J.
Ryan s b ederal constitc ency. He held the
seat, a reliable Labor one, before, and got
•® u no 5 1 ? ina * :i ? n or a ' n * w term. But Ryan,
with his third deficit and other troubles
ahead, decided to quit the Queensland Pre-
miership, and there wasn’t a safe Federal
seat available in his own State. Con Wal-
lace made room, and it was assumed that
something would be done for him. What
was done was a job as shipping-master at
Brisbane, with £220 a year to begin with.
The official record as regards his prede-
cessor was simply “H. Sawyer, £270,” so
possibly the wage was reduced for Con’s
benefit. In fact, no one seemed to have
much use for him after he had served his
turn- —certainly not the Queensland State
Ministry. Having got tired of doing battle
with the H.C.L. in a strange city, the ex-
member presently gave, it up and went home
- —to find the atmosphere grown just about as
cold there as it was farther north. The wolves
are too hungry to leave the chase just
because an old leader has returned and wants
the front place in the pack again.
J. W. Leckie, who left the Vic. Assembly
to represent Indi in the Reps. for one Parlia-
ment, has enlisted in Premier Lawson’s
army, and will have a try for the Upper
Gdulburn seat. Alex. Parker, Labor mem-
ber for P’ran, who lately survived an attempt
to unseat him on a technicality, won’t be
facing Donald Mackinnon this time. Ills
opponent will be Dr. R. H. Fetherston, who
was Pearce’s Director-General of Medical
Services during the war. R. F. Toutcher,
the veteran Nationalist member for Ararat
and Stawell, is expecting Labor opposition,
and there is some Labor talk of nominating
T. M. Burke, the ex-sec. of the defunct Co-
operative Stores, and now a real-estate mag-
nate in Collins-street.
With the death of Edwyn J. Statham,
A.1.C.E., who was born at Parramatta
(N.S.W.) 81 years ago, there passed'the
last of the pioneer officers of the old Public
Works Department. Statham retired in
.1896, after 32 years’ active service. lie
carried out the first section of the Bulli
Pass, and his tine engineering work between
Grafton and Armidale, and throughout the
Dorrigo, provide him with a permanent
memorial. He laid out and supervised the
construction of more roads* in N. S. Wales
than any other engineer. Towards the end
of his service he was senior supervising engi-
neer for the State, and then was Acting Com-
missioner; for Roads. lie was. a widower
and three sons survive—Claude, solicitor, of
Wollongong; Clive, rector-of Christ Church,
Sydney ; and Geoffrey, who, after planting in
the Solomons, returned to Sydney recently
to take up art.
In a “message'’ to LaboriteS telling them
how he had just missed the 'bus, Prenaergast,
Vic. Opposition leader, refers to Governor
Btradbroke a.s “the Crown authority.” Per-
haps the Ear] feels like; fellow-peer Car-
michael did when Jack Murray criticised him
for giving Bent a dissolution. Afterwards,
vrhen he was accepting a commission to get
a Cabinet together, Murray looked a trifle
awkward, and, being quizzed by his Ex.,
said he was afraid lie had been rather free in
his criticism. "Oh,” said Carmike, “that
ssort of talk doesn’t worry me, so don’t, let
list embarrass you. It isn’t worth a second
thought.” Bowser harbored no resentment
against -Gov. Stanley for refusing him a dis-
so&stion, and made the hit of the evening at
a valedictory to S’rarthur by recalling the
yarn of the meenister who explained to_ con-
troversial kirk folk that the Lord A'michty
had to do things in His offeecial capocit.v
that He would scorn to do in His private
capocity.
Peter Mcßride has had his term as Tic.
Agent-General extended till Feb. 20, 1922.
The Order-in-Council was put through after
“Stradbroke had granted the Assembly disso-
lution. John McWhae up till the present

is expected, rest on his laurels.

IN A FRIVOLOUS FRAME OF MIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“When in a frivolous frame of mind I smoke
cigarettes.. . .but when I see women smoking on
steamers I really think that —well, 1 shall say no
more.” —Senator Paddy Lynch.
Say no more, Senator, say no more —
We thoroughly understand !
Strange how folks who are staid ashore
Go gay when they leave the land.
Under the spell of wave and wind
Deacons who’ve well and unwisely dined
Fondle the hands of womankind,
Calling them “kid” or “pet,”
And Pat, in his frivolous frame of mind,
Ignites a cigarette!
Ye who go down to the sea in ships
His frank acknowledgment con !
When a coffin-nail decorates Lynch’s lips
His frivolous mood is on.
And, thus inclined, if he chance to find
A nymph with a weed in a nook designed
Fbr two —-Well, hang it, the gods are kind
And circumspect the crew!
Since he’s in a frivolous frame of mind
No doubt she’s frivolous, too.

George Wishart Smith, the live wire who
runs the slowest railways in Australia,
those in the Speck, has had his term as. Com-
missioner extended for a year. When he
crossed over from W.A. to take charge he
was getting £l2OO a year, but the insult has
now gone to £l7OO.
George Reid had been playfully accused
of holding a certain proposal (typified as a
young lady for convenience of debate) in his
lap. “Mr. Speaker, there is no lady,” pleaded
George. “And I have only to sit to demon-
strate the monstrous absurdity of the rest
of the accusation.” He sat. “You see, there
is no lap.”
“Wafin”: Here's an example of how bat-
tered Billjims can “carry on.” Although
Iligger Sweeney has lost a leg, 1 saw him at
Won Wron (Vic.) recently harrowing with
a three-horse team, driving from the saddle
ol a fourth horse. Any able-bodied man who
has tried this will realise the difficulty ; but
Rill was whistling like a butcher-bird.
“Congo”: A Sydney chemist, MeNaugh-
ron, lit up his premises by gas which he
manufactured with a small plant as early as
1828. The first gasometer was imported bv
Thomas Street qn August in, 1833. The
Australian Gaslight Co. did not supply the
commodity until May 24, 1841. In view of
the fact that McNaughton used gas in 1828
and Street imported his gasometer in 1833,
these two are surely more entitled to bo re-
ferred to as our gas parents than parson
Mansfield, the promoter of the big co.
When the old boys of Adelaide's big
schools had their annual dinners lately, St.
. eters were, able to claim a remarkable
grip on leading positions. Chief Justice
Murray, Premier Harwell and citv-mayor
Moulden are all “Old Saints.” Also, they
have at last got a player in Test matches,
though Pel lew hardly ranks yet. with
and Clem Hill from Prince Alfred’s. The
late Phil Newland, of St. Peter’s, once went
with an Australian XI as second wicket-
keeper, but at practice on board, soon after
starting, he received a frightful blow in the
face, and he never again showed any form.
In fact, there is not much doubt that his
early death was due to the injury.
**T. Weed”: It isn't generally known that
Mackenzie-Grieve, the naval man who
essayed the Atlantic flight with Hawker, was
on the Australian station as a sub-lieutenant
in the early days of this century. The Old
Man (Captain C. E. Kingsmill) was filling
in the annual report on officers, a confiden-
tial document in which there was a column
headed “Special Qualifications.” In 'this
had to be stated the officer’s proficiency in,
*ay, gunnery, torpedo-work, navigation, lan-
guages, etc. I was deputed to ask Mac-
kenzie-Grieve what special qualification he
prided himself on. He replied that he was
pretty good on the piano with one finger.
The Old Man nearly had a fit.
To go exploring in the old days seems to
have been one way of ensuring a long life.
In his book on the Upper Murray Dr.
Andrews gave the after-history of four of the
six assigned men who went overland with
Hamilton Hume and Hovel] to Port Phillip
in 1824. Henry Lyncji formed a station at
Uardry and diet} at Wagga, aged I*l. Thomas
Boyd, the first white man to cross the
Murray, passed out a pensioner at 88.
Janies Fitzpatrick, who became a fairly
wealthy squatter, lived for 86 years. Wil-
liam Bollard kept a pub at Pieton and died
well up in years. What became of Claude
Bossawa and Thomas Smith is not recorded.
Hume and llovell themselves both lived to
be very old men.
Melbourne-born Oswald Stoll, the brains
of the music-hall business in England, and
in addition an ad-
mitted authority on
finance, has been
invited to stand for
Parliament. While
not exactly declin-
ing, the vaudeville
knight says he
thinks the message
he has to deliver
can be given better
from outside the
II ous e- o f Com-
mons. It is a good
message, anyhow—
the early extinction
o f unconvertible
paper, the return
to a gold standard
and “credit rightly
based on produc-
tive properties.”

the ball at Buckingham Palace in silk knee-
breeches. Elderly gentlemen in knee-breeches
are painful spectacles. I recall meeting
George Turner and Charlie Kingston simi-
farly arrayed (they were Privy Councillors)
Ar , barn-like Melbourne exhibition on
M®J' <), 1901, when George and Mary (.then
Duke and Duchess of York) were chief
guests. It was pretty wintry that night, and
George and Charlie shivered. Turner relieved
the monotony by telling me an experience of
the morning. While waiting for Parliament
to be opened by Edward the Seventh’s
deputy he and Kingston picked up the Bible
on which they were to be sworn and pricked
the edge of the closed volume with a pin
Kingston’s search for a suitable text was
fruitless, but Turner declared that his pin
had pierced a verse relating to a Treasury
chest. ‘‘\\ hat was it?” I asked. George con-
fessed that he had forgotten, and referred
me to his colleague and fellow-lawyer. “Get
a Concordance and look it up,” said King-
ston. And I haven’t.
“Old Bill” Bartlett, the beer-maker of
Goulburn (N.S.W.), has sold his brewery to
-booths, but is still managing the concern.
The veteran is an ex-naval man, and talks
like a sailor still, though many gales have
blown since he trod the deck. After 80 years
of strenuous life he is a testimonial to the
wholesomeness of his own beer. Asked the
other day if he was going to retire, William
said ‘Retire be damned,” which, being inter-
for the land-lubber, means that lie is
not. These sailors have an involved way of
expressing themselves sometimes.
“S.T.S.”: A remarkable artistic brother-
hood has just died out with Leslie the
painter. In lSt">4 he and 10 other voung
artists in London, all just about 80, formed
the St. John’s Wood “Gridirons.” Their
record was amazing. Two died young, but
one ol these, the genius Fred Walker, had
already secured the A.R.A. Du Maurier
became famous as satirist and illustrator in
black and white,' ancj later as a novelist
Every one of the rest, Leslie, Calderon
Hodgson, Storey, Yeames, Staeev Marks, Val
I nnsep and Eyre Crowe, gave the mid-
\ ictorian public the kind of painting it
wanted, and gained the coveted K.A. Leslie
at SO, was the last survivor.
“Artist”: A par by “Whitebait” (B.
21/7/’2l) re Max Meldrum’s claims to a
trusteeship of the Melbourne National Gal-
lery prompts me to cite a few qualifications
that should assure Meldrum the job if merit
is to count: (1) He was a winner of the
Gallery s own hallmark, the travelling
scholarship; (2) he has work in both Me)
bourne and Sydney National Galleries; (8>
his portraits of public men are admittedly
above the ordinary; (4) he is the founder
of prooably the largest and assuredly the
soundest school of painting in this country
due to his kindness towards all sincere stu-
dents and young artists; (5) already the
trustees have'deemed him suitable for the
.job by getting his opinion on various mat-
ters concerning art; 16) he is an Australian
and intends to stay here. Further. Meldrum
has exhibited with success at the Salon—not
that, it means much to him. but it counts a
great deal with those who look for the official
stamp even on an artist.

kennal’s recent successes, calls him “a fine

bination of artistic

good business head ; a
most resourceful man,
too, and he holds to
his opinions firmly.”
As an instance of the
last trait, Streeton
mentions that the
Australian (the first
to Jbe elected an asso-
ciate of the, Royal
Academy in England)
calmly moved that
members should retire
from all control upon
reaching 75. The
plan was considered
too revolutionary; but,
within the last year
a big leavening of
younger artists has
been allowed on the
committee.
Tlfe village of Ilnon, in north-east Vie.,
preserves' the name of the first Frenchman
who found a home in Australia —Gabriel
Louis Marie Iluon de Kerilleau, an offshoot
of a noble family, who found the France
of the revolution too hot to hold him. He
enlisted in the .N. S. Wales Corps and came
to Sydney in 1703. Later he was a tutor
to John Macarthur’s family, married a
Freneh-Canadian, Louise Le Sage, and
settled <»n a farm in Argyle. He was lost
in the bush in 1829. His sons were among
the first settlers on the Upper Murray.
“Rienzi”’ about an old pal:—
Though Mrs. llarry Hawker lias denied that her
late hero owned damaged spine, he certainly
sustained injuries id that region when testing ’buses
at Brooklands, Hawker was aloft in a new machine
when some of the control wires snapped, and he
only .saved himself by doing the “falling leaf"
trick. He came to a. sudden anchorage in a tree,
and, though lie was knocked about, he was more
concerned for the fa’ie. v of his vehicle. His
affection for his machine was shown when he was
fished out of tlie Atlantifc during his fly from
America to Ireland. .Before he was drawn in out
of the wet by the Danish steamer Mary, he vigorously
argued with the skipper about fastening a hawser to
the ’plane. As the sea made the operation dan-
gerous, the Old Man refused, though lie was offered
£5OO by the young derelict on the end of the
line. Hawker, by the way, tried to interest our
Defence Department in the Sopworth biplane which
he brought to Australia in 1913. The Department
gave it several bad marks, so Hawker took it back
to England, where it became the model for hundreds
of units in the air fleet.
HOW ADAM FELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The story of tiie fall of man
My purpose is to tell,
imperfect is the tale that ran
In Genesis, but I can plan
Just how and why he fell.
Wife-seeking once myself, chose I
A maiden straight from college,
Unskilled in cookery. That’s why
To this old theme I can apply
The light of modern knowledge.
That’s why I see how Adam came
His awful thud, and know
The anguish that possessed his frame,
Contortions dree that shook the same,
His untold inward woe.
Eve gave the apple to him there,
A glad light in her eye,
Not raw, as ancient screeds infer,
Hm nearly cooked ; in short, in her
First home-made apple-pie!
VICTORIA.

BALL BEARINGS
Heavy transportation of work in mines, foundries and engineering establishments entails enormous
manual labor if plain bearings are used. If, however, your trucks and skips are fitted with Ball
Bearings, it is possible for one man to start a truck heavily loaded with a mere push of the hand, and to
keep it in motion by slight continuous pressure. Furthermore, SKF Ball Bearings need lubrication
only every other or every third month, whereas p lain bearings require frequent oiling.

The Champion Cricket.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FIRST you must know that a man has
two souls, the greater soul and the
lesser.
It was during the reign of the Emperor
Hsu an Teh, of the Ming dynasty, about
a.d. 1430, that lights between crickets,
upon which large sums were wagered,
became so much the fashion at (Jourt
that orders were sent to the provincial offi-
cials to provide a plentiful supply »f the
insects. They are comparatively rare in tin-
western provinces of China : nevertheless, the
magistrate of Ilwa Yin, in Shansi, ; being
anxious to acquire favor, sent up to the
Court one so redoubtable that it vanquished
allcomers. But instead of honor this brought
gieat trouble to the district, for .orders imme-
diately came for others of the same qualitv
underlings were sent out to compel the vil-
lage heaumen to collect them; which gave
the headmen a glorious opportunity to on-
ress the villagers.
A schoolmaster named Cheng, who unfor-
tunately had made enemies, was especially
victimised, and eventually found himself
so ruined that he told his wife there whs no-
thing left for him but suicide. She, how-
ever, persuaded him to search again in the
hope of finding what his persecutors de-
manded. So Cheng wont‘out into tile coun-
try once more, carrying a small pot of water
and a cage constructed of gauze, and wan-
dered about from morning till evening turn-
mg over every stone and probing every hob-
ble found only two or three crickets, and as
they all were condemned as being too weak
to make good fighters, in reward for his
trouble, he received a -hundred blows of the
bamboo, which incapacitated him for further
search. Again lie told his wife that he had
better kill himself, and again she dissuaded
him and told him to wait.
Just at that time a hump-backed witch
arrived at Hwa Yin, and Mrs. Cheng took
the little money that remained, bought pre-
sents with it, and went off to consult tile
wise Woman. There was a crowd before the
entrance of the house of the oracle, as her
tame was widespread. She was seated in a
dark room which had a lattice in place of
a door, and in front of the lattice was an
incense-burner. Persons desiring to consult
her must place incense on the charcoal in
the burner, prostrate themselves before it
and formulate their questions in their minds
without uttering a word. After an interval
short or long, there would he thrown through
the lattice a paper on which was written
the answer to the inquiry. Mrs. Cheng went
through the prescribed form, and on the
paper thrown out to her she found, instead
of writing, a drawing of a hillock on which
were stones and tangled grass. At the top
of the picture was a gnat, and at the bottom
a cricket; Unable to make anything of this
she ' took it home to her husband, who recog-
nised in it a picture of the waste ground
behind the East Pagoda, and understood that
it was there he must search.
Raising himself with difficulty he made his
way to the pagoda with his pot of water
and the gauze cage, and found the spot shown
m the drawing. Y\ hile searching among the
grass he noticed a gnat descending and
watched it perch upon a leaf, and under the
loat he saw an enormous cricket, with which
he returned home in triumph.
Now Cheng had a little nine-year-old sou,
who was very keen to have a good look at
the cricket, and one day when his father
was absent he uncovered the basin in which
it was kept and out it lumped. The lad
rushed after it and caught it, but handled
it so roughly that he tore it to pieces.
When Cheng came back and learned the
dreadful news from bis wife he searched
some time for his son, and at length dis-
covered him drowned in the well. The un-
happy parents in silence wrapped up the
body in a straw mat, but when the evening
came and they were preparing for the burial
they found that the child was breathing,
and for a time were overcome with joy.
When they had with difficulty revived him,
they found to their despair that he had
become an idiot. The broken-hearted father
was pensively regarding first his idiot son
and then the empty basin, when suddenly
the chant of a cricket was heard. Up leapt
Cheng, and there, sitting in the basin, was
a cricket. Cheng immediately took hold of it,
and found, to his surprise, that it. appeared
to have no weight; yet it was a fine-looking
cricket, and all that remained to do was
to ascertain what qualities it possessed as a
fighter. A lad in the village was training a
cricket that was reputed to be of quite
remarkable mettle, and Cheng went to him
with his captive and proposed a match
between the two. Confident of victory, the
lad accepted the challenge ; but immediately
the two combatants were placed in the lists,
he was astounded to see Cheng’s champion
throw himself on his adversary, seize it by
the crest and raise a song of victory. The
lad hurriedly rescued his pet to save its life.
At that moment a cock came past and
attempted to pick up the victor, but the
cricket hopped up and seized the bird by tin-
comb. It certainly was a cricket that had
no equal. Cheng took it proudly to the
magistrate, who matched it against others
and also against a cock. There was no doubt
about it: this cricket was unique, and lie
sent it to his superior, who placed it in a
golden cage and despatched it to Court.
There the cricket regularly demolished ever?
adversary, and was moreover found to dance
to the music of a zither.
The Emperor was so crazy about the crea-
ture that he asked over and over again if
suitable rewards had been bestowed on those
responsible for procuring the prodigy. The
mandarins of the district were promoted,
and Cheng, relieved from all taxes and im-
posts, became wealthy. But at the approach
of winter the cricket died, and that very day
the idiot son of Cheng became suddenly and
entirely sane. “How tired I am I’’ he said.
“I have been a cricket and have had to fight
hard. But, thank goodness, it is now fin-
ished.”
As any Chinese learned in such matters
could tell you, the inferior soul had kept
the boy alive, while the superior soul became
a cricket ’and redressed the wrong done to
the father. And to this day the fighting of
crickets is a favorite sport in China.

Quality — Classic —combine all that
is implied by those two words and embody it
into a car with the skill, the pride and the finish
of experts realising what once seemed a dream,
accomplishing the materialisation of an ideal they have strived
after throughout the years, with all the care and spirit of
artists—and you have some conception of what awaits you
in the ownership of a “Wolseley” Ten, Fifteen or Twenty
model.
But even if we could command the lucid word-weaving of all
the Kings of Letters we must still, somehow, fail to impart to
the descriptions the consummate satisfaction, the complete
comfort, the exhilarating joy and thrill that goes with every
ride in a “Wolseley.” No eloquence, written or verbal, coud
ever tell you of all the “Wolseley” means. Just sink into
the cosy cushions ’mongst the richly luxurious appointments
feel die car spring off to a sweet start and swing along in
easy, steady manner—and you will agree that all it means
and spells must be forever denied word-birth.
you can and will KNOW all this, FEEL all this: Take
YOUR ride in the “Wolseley” now. Let it tell you all that
every “Wolseley” owner already knows. Call on the nearest
“Wolseley” representative early. He will gladly demonstrate
its value.
Here are short descriptions of each of the models ready for
immediate delivery:—
The “Wolseley” Ten.
The '‘Wolseley” Ten marks a most decided advance
in “runabout” design, and is equipped with advan-
tages hitherto associated with cars much higher
in price. It is easy to handle, speedy, reliable,
requires the minimum of attention, is decidedly
economical in upkeep cost, and develops over 20 h.p.
£690
The “Wolseley” Fifteen.
Although an entirely new model, the “Wolseley”
Fifteen retains the various excellencies of des gn
which have made the “Wolseley” famous, differing
only in certain modifications .whose value has been
learned by experience in building aero-engines and
fine naval mechanism during the war period. In
speed, flexibility, hill-climbing power and riding
comfort, the “Fifteen” has no peer, whilst ample
reserve of power always available makes it a
delightful car to handle. The weight of the
“Wolseley” Fifteen complete is 23cwt., and the
engine develops over 40 h.p., the power-weight ratio
being 3h.p. to the cwt.

Despite the high renown which “Wolseleys” have
ever held for power, smoothness and reliability, the
post-war model will be found a distinct advance on
its predecessors. It is a splendid car in every
respect, reliable to the greatest degree, beautiful,
and offering the acme of comfort and convenience.
The “Wolseley” Twenty develops over 60 h.p.

That table is not of much value, except
that it (.1) gives profits as disclosed by the
directors, after they had provided unspeci-
fied amounts for depreciation, and (If) pre-
sents the, co.’s dividend record. Neither the
amounts written off nor the reserves, can be
regarded seriously. Each year a round sum
is added to the reserve account, and the
balance is then dropped into a contingency
stockpot. In the past the stockpot lias twice
overflowed and given shareholders bonus
shares—£l9,3B9 in 191(5 and £6667 in 1920.
At present £7013 is in the pot, and, no
doubt, that amount can be regarded as a
genuine reserve along with the £25,000
shown in the table. But even that £32,000-
odd cannot be guaranteed as the full mea-
sure of reserves, for the amounts charged
against revenue for depreciation are not
divulged, and if the management cared it
could stuff away a good deal of profit in
that barrel. Like those in other States, this
brewery is finding that there is nowadays not
the profit-in beer there used to be. The flow
is heavier than ever: excise officers handled
almost 8-1 million gallons in Queensland for
the 12 months to June, 1920, compared with
5,650,000ga1. in 191(5. But the Common-
wealth now levies Is. 3d. per gal. excise in-
stead of the former (Id. Meantime working
exes, have soared, and taxes liavp increased.
The breweries have hot succeeded in passing
on all the additional charges, so profits have
not kept pace with the increased trade. On
the other hand, the beer-faetor'es were for-
tunate in so successfully surviving the anti-
liquor campaign launched during the war,
and the northern brewers, in narticular, were
favored by their friends, the Labor Govern-
ment, who not only refused to disturb pre-
war hotel hours hut nersjsted in a spend-
thrift policy which aided beer sales.
The Queensland Brewery management has
apparently never been in doubt as to the
future of beer in the Northern State. For
years it has liben enlarging its plant and
extending its retail connections. After m ak-
ing allowances each year for depreciation
the directors now show £41,566 more in the
brewery, plant, hotels, etc., than just prior
to the war. To finance these extensions a
lot of new money has been introduced. Paid
capital is now £120,500, compared with
£OO,OOO seven years ago, but £35,550 of that
£60,500 increase has been transferred re-
serves. About £25,000 of new capital has
been put in ; meantime, the business has been
assisted by about £17,000 of stored profit.
M hile so much of the co.’s funds has gone
into plant and properties, the co.’s liguid
position has been strengthened

Six years ago this old-established money-
lending concern had £102,964 of funds at
work; it now employs £216,801. Paid capi-
tal iu 1915 was £112,500; at June 30 last,
£175,080. Of'the increase of £65,580 capi-
talised reserves account for £28,125, so
£31,455 of new money has been put in by
shareholders. On the enlarged capital 121
p.c*. is being paid, and that indicates how
conditions continue to favor Uncle. There
certainly is only a small margin of visible
surplus profit after making the distribution,
but each year’s income is shown “after pro-
viding for bad and doubtful debts,” and sub-
stantial sums may be going into that stock-
ing. The accounts are not communicative;
assets are displayed in this way: advances
on mortgages, pledges and other securities,
£213,004 ; premises, £21,931; cash, etc., £2308 ;
office furniture, £967. The big item is now
£51,025 larger than it was 12 months ago,
and additional capital has not alone been
sufficient to finance this expansion. So,
whereas at ..Mine 30, 1920, the co. owed only
£3163, including provision for taxes, at the
latest balance there were sundry creditors
for £12.265 and £9117 was owing on bank
overdraft. Still, these liabilities are very
small in relation to the eo.’s own funds.
The co.’s position may he even easier than
is apparent from the published balance-sheet,
for no hint is given of the nature of “other
securities” in the big composite item. A
couple of years ago a certain amount of
Bar Loan was held, and part of the
f2tji,oo4 in me basket may still represent
something more liquid than the usual run of
moneylenders’ advances.

Twelve months ago the directors announced
that a large number of contracts were on
hand, several of them substantial: Tas
Hydro-Electric Dept., £39,000; Kundos
£12,000; and £15,(100 of work for
various \\ a ter Boards throughout the Com-
monwealth and Maori I and. Anticipating that
the co. would do well out of this work and
the revived activity in wafer-schemes, and
no doubt, also with an eye on alleged threats
on the part of some (lovernment or other to
snavel "excess'’ profits, the directors decided
that 1 1. was advisable to revalue assets and
get them more in line with appreciated
values. So the co. was reconstructed; visible
reserves of £4830 were capitalised, patents and
trade mark (in other words, goodwill) were
written up by £7413, and property and pJant
wete apparently treated likewise for £22,757,
ff' vefl ant] },, lded values making up the
i.mJMIO necessary to provide' three tl iullv-
paids in the new co. for every two in the
old; paid capital being increased from £70,000
to £10.i,()U7. Now, from the past year's
operations, 10 p.c. is being paid on the en-
larged capital, equal to 45 p.c. on the old.
that is the best achievement to date: though
the. co. started well, the war delayed pro-
posed water, schemes, and during 'the five
years to 1919 divs. averaged lesls than 5.? p.c.,
p.a.- Ihe co. has a lot of work in sight in-
cluding a £lO,OOO contract from the Mel-
hour ne Board of Works, and “wood stave

"Like many another Australian . experi-
ment, the idea was excellent in'its concep-
tion, efficient in its earlier administration,
and unfortunate in its ultimate entry upon
tlie slippery slope of political interference.
The dreadful monotony with which promising
reforms enacted by Australian Parliaments
pass through these life-cycles of three stages
conveys to the world a lesson, if it does not
bear a hope.”— Prof. Meredith Ajjfinsou,
preaching economics from the text of the
Agricultural Bank of 11 estraha.
“R.W.8.”: The manufacture of sulphate
of alumina was never seriously attempted in
Australia till 1919, when, attracted by war-
time' prices, two young Melbourne engineers,
X. G. Roper and M. J. Martin, pooled their
chemical knowledge and, backed by a sub-
stantial order from Australian Paper Mills,
began to make itJTom Victorian kaolin. First
attempts, though successful as to quality, con-
vinced them that kaolin could not be economi-
cally treated, and they were compelled to
search for a less refractory material. This
was found at Narracan, Gipnsland, where de-
posits of bauxite were taken up. .They are
now turning out sufficient of the chemical
to meet the present requirements of the Com
monwealth, and a eo.~ Sulphates Pty., Ltd.
—has been formed to instal 'up-to-date works
and capture some of the extehsjye M.L.,
South American and Asiatic* trade'. L. W.
Roper, who lent a hand in Eranjee, controls
mining and roasting operations. He estimates
850,000 tons of high-grade ore easily avail-
able' on the eo.’s leases. The sulphate, apart
from its use by paper and "hoard” maim-
facturers, tanners and dyers, is cm ployed in
the purification of water, for which purpose
it is also supplied in a crude .hut efficient
and cheap form as alum cake. On comple-
tion of the new works the co. expects to §iyc*
the Old World producers a hurry alcxng.

“Temora”: I enter the Derwent Jack,
sometimes confounded with the butcher-bird, as the
champion lightweight of feathered pugs. The other
day I taw two hawks chasing two magpies, and judg-
ing by their screams the maggies were having a bad
spin. Then out shot a pair of jacks. Flying
straight at the hawks, they began punishing them
with severe uppercuts and downward drives. The
hawks, like all bullies when cornered, soon threw
in the towel, and, after getting a sound trouncing,
hurriedly left.
A MOONLIGHT SONATA.
RUDOLPH RAT: "That’s the first piece of
cheese I’ve seen without a trap on it for
months.”
Maski' : Re “Sepoma’s” assault upon
BPuk Brother in ex-German New Guinea (B.
27/l/’2l). Pardon this delving,into what to you is
ancient history, but here in New Hanover it is as
fresh as a new-laid egg. Black brother’s sores arc
largely due to the effects of coral, which poisons any
wound, and not to “Sepoma's” “layers of d'rt.” I*
defy any nearly-naked individual to carry layers of
dirt in a climate which provides shower-baths with
the regularity of this rain-swept spot. With regard
to “Sepoma’s” statements about the boys’ disbelief
in medicine, I’ve found the reverse the ease. Just as
a child thinks any elderly person is full of wisdom,
so the Kanaka thinks the white man is; indeed, the
Kanaka, in all his wavs, is just like an intelligent
child of 12 or 13. The wh’te man’s medicine he
takes with a tort hing and often quite misplaced
faith. I have 150 boys, so I know. The natives
of ex-German New Guinea, are a very fine type, and,
unless they have been to one of the missions, are
honest and truthful. The only bright produet--of the
missions I have struck was the boy who on seeing an
eel'p'-e of the sun remarked in awe: “I tink kero-
sene belong Jesus Christ he all go finish.”
“Jimsey” (B. 21/7/’2l) asked
how the term “ringer” originated. It came into
use in the first excitement of the gold-rushes, when
men dreamed and spoke of nothing but gold. So
the decent cove rang true, in the . same way as
a dinkum coin rang true when thrown down, whereas
the brummy fell with a thud. From that it was a
short step to “ringer,” applied to man, horse or
brand of rum. All the same, I don’t think the
shearers got the word that way. Theirs, came from
the expression “run rings round” anything, the
man who can run rings round the other's being the
ringer in a shed.
* * * *
/'Billy T”: “It was careless of us, as it.
proved subsequent,” said Ole Bill, telling one of
his far-northern stories, >“but we was new to the
country we was prospectin’, an’ . never dreamed a
word about halligators. We had camped by a bit
iv a river, ar.d, as we was movin’ along nexj mornin’,
did not trouble to pitch a tent, but dossed under
a tree, the night being warm. When I wake up,
Dan’s gorn. I looks all round, I calls, I coo-ee. Not
a word. Then, gorstruth, somethin’ stirs about 15
yards off on the river bank—stirs, and, lifting tiis
h'idjis head* .yawns like the openin' up of a new
butchery. It is a ole-man halligator. With a yell
I jumps for a tree. Now, 1 know why Dan don’t
answer me. Poor Dan’s gone where he’s got nothin’
more to say for hissdf. Shakin’ all over like a
leaf, 1 puts up me little prayer.” “Wha’ for, Bob?”
asked the barman. Bob’s voice quavered. “I thanks
the good Gord A’mighty,” he ,said, “that w’en ’e
sent a halligator it was no glutton.”
* * * *
“Temora”: Re “Bouragl’s” denial (B.
7/7/’’2l) that miners used the word “fracteur.” In
Kalgoorlie, where the miners of the world have gath-
ered, no other term is used. They can’t lose time
straining their vocal orgars with big words when
the universal “fracteur” fills the bill.
“Wit Ruv”: Can any Abo.-writer give
me a tip on wholesale dingo-destruction? Strych-
nine being expensive for baiting "over large -areas,
will arsenic do, ar.d how much has to go to each
bait before the dingo ceases to be a judge of mutton?
“J.L.K.”: I often wonder what thoughts
lie behind a horses eves. Whilst mustering in
’l3, one of the hands, losing patience with his horse,
which wa's giving him a lot of trouble, dismounted
and flogged it very cruelly with a stockwhip. In
’l7 it chanced that ,he was riding the same neddy
at a canter through some heavily-timbered country.
Without apparent cause the horse shied —jumping
sideways like a startled rabbit. It was the thick
lowej; limb gf a red-gum that sent the man on
his long journey. As I rode up the horse was
standing over his dead rider, and I am sure it
was malicious triumph I saw in his eye.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: Are all .sheep lacking in intelli-
gence ? 1 'came across a merino ewe hogget rec ently
that was badly fly-blown on both sides and up to-
wards the point of the shoulder. She was standing
with one side against a blazing log, burning
out the affected portion. As I thought that
shears and dip might perhaps make a better job
of it, I tried to catch her, but she got
away into the scrub. Later I mustered the
paddock, and found her quite free from flies. She
had apparently returned to the' fire-and effectively
burnt out all the affected parts.

“Pise”: Here’s the record of a dinkum
Digger I know. After several years in France,
where he was gassed, he returned. Almost at once
he and his wife had pneumonic ’flu, then the children
had measles and diphtheria, and finally he and one
child had appendicitis. Yet, in spite of it all, he
has ga\ed gnougji from his wage as a grocer’s assist-
ant to build a small home. A five-roomed frame
cottage will cost, him £450, and as that’s too much
I suggest pis?-. Now can some abo. furnish infor-
mation concerning: (1) Cost per sq. ft. of wall

“H.V.E.”: Tell '“Bill Bowyang,” re the
black snake’s family (B. 2.1/7/’2l), that the number
produced annually, according to Waite, is from 12
to 20. Personally, I’ve relieved a female black of
16 very lively youngsters, and as the young are
contained before birth in sacks of white parchment-
like skin, in which' they lie still, there is no
doubt that they can temporarily return to the shelter
afforded by mamma’s interior, The number of young
varies. In another case the slain female yielded only
10 juvenile serpents—still in their sacks. I have
two of these potted in spirits—one still ensacked
and the other, which measures fully 12in. in length,
relieved of its shroud. I think the size also varies,
Otherwise mother black snake might have to find
room, in the aggregate, for 240 in. of snakelet, i.e.,
20 measuring each 12in.
“Ophis”: Re “Bill Bowyang’s” (B.
21/7/’2l) query as to the number of youngsters
produced by the black snake (Pseudechis porphy-
riacus). No authentic mention can be found of any
crawler of this species ever having exceeded 20
young at any one time. I have on several occasions
opened specimens of the black snake and found the
number of developing young to vary from 8 to 15,
ard although quite aware that this species does
often produce in the vie inity of 20 at a time, I
have never had the luck to interview one who, had
more than 15 in the oviducts. The number of
young- is not restricted to. 19, as -is supposed by
many bushmen, but varies as nature permits, and
even the supppsed 20 limit may be occasionally
exceeded.
“Bad Australian”: Re those shrunken
human heads mentioned by “Herodot” (B. 14/7/’2l).
A few years ago, on the Madeira River, a tributary of
the Amazon, a half-breed trader named Carbajal, on
his way down from Tierra Adentro, swung his ham-
mock at my camp until he had recovered from an
attack of fever. Among other products of the higher

“Send Hilly in and I’ll giro him a tot of rum—he's tired, don’t you think?"
“I tink we jes' about the Same, boss."
country he showed me a' number of quills filled with
gold dust, several of the rare ceremonial coronets
made of red and yellow feathers fixed in a band
of curiously-woven monkey-hair, and two human
heads about 24in. or 3in. in diameter. These heads
were covered with a thick switch of black hair about
18in. long almost as fine as that of a European;
but, despite this fact, the faces had a distinctly
negroid appearance. The eyes were closed, the face
and ears were full and plump without sign of a
wrinkle, and the skin had a curious glossy appear-
ance as if it had been waxed or polished. Carbajal,
who'had been many years on', the Upper Amazon, told
me that these gruesome objects were found on'y
among certain tribes inhabiting the forest country
between the Paras ar.d the Upper Madeira. He could
say nothing as to how the heads were procured in
the first instance or how the shrinking was done.
All he was sure about was that they were rare
merchandise worth “mucho plata” in Para.
“F.A.C.”: Re “Mag’s” (B. 14/7/’2l) and
others’ references to hermaphrodites. A few years
back at Caiwarra station (Q.) a mob of horses was
yarded and one was noticed to possess the peculiari-
ties of both sexes. It was put in a separate yard,
NATURAL HISTORY NOTE.
“Oh, gug-gug-grannie! There's a cow mew-
ing in the next paddock, an' — an' — an' —

and the station stallion turned in. Immediate I}' 1 }'
the stallion made a rash at the stranger, and would
have killed it but for our intervention. We were
quite satisfied then that the freak was more stallion
than mare.
“Zanthus”: If ever Jack Ramsay, of
Sydney, publishes his bird and other photo-
graphs, . they ought to make a hit. One.
at least is unique. It’s a flashlight of a
podargua (mopoke) feeding two young ones at
night on a limb about 60ft. from the ground. Jus;
before dusk Ramsay fixed his camera and flash-
powder, and then got down and waited. He had so
arranged that when the mopoke came between hi>
eye and a certain star he knew it was the right
second and pulled the string. For his aerial work
on nests and so on, Ramsay uses a special rope-
ladder. He throws a weight with a string attached
over a limb, and then pulls the rope up with the
string; and there aren’t many trees that he won't
climb somehow.
“Audak”: I recently saw a eojcky hard at
it with a chain-pipe wrench ring-barking saplings
and seedlings from lin. up to 4in. in diameter, and
doing it at a speed four or five times that of an axe-
man. He fixed the wrench round the trunk, and with
a half-turn the bark was ripped off, in some cases
leaving the trunk bare for three or four feet. I
should like to know if this method has an effect in
the way of sucker-growing worse than with axe-ring-
ing. For speed in getting over the acres the wrench
certainly puts the axe out of the hunt.
* * ' * *
“Joe”: Grown from a pip in a flower-pot
and planted out in the garden of Woodside estate,
Kobby Boyne (Vic.), is a large orange-tree which
has borne good fruit in large numbers for years.
Evidently the orchardists’ claim that orange-tree-
have to be grafted to be any good is another super-
stition.
“Glab”: “Aragun” (B. 14/7/’2l) in-
quires for a bald-headed Binghi.* I have seen sev-
eral, and two or three I mention offhand. In 19C1
Dickie Goolagong, at Euabalong (N.S.W.), exhibited
a cranium almost as bare as the emu eggs I bought
from him. At Innamineka station (S.A.-Q. border),
in the same year, I visited royalty, attending the
Court of Billy', the loral abo. monarch, of Burke
and Mills fame. Any old hand in that district can
vouch for the droughty condition of his regal scalp.
And in the last “Country Week” procession through
Sydney two very real, very anciert and very bald
abos. were starred, squatting outside a mia-mia.
“Wingo”: About the best bush remedy I
know of for a fly-struck sheep is a handful of warm
ashes. If you set fire to a bit of brush when you
catch the sheep, the ashes are just right to rub on
by the time you have shorn the patch of flies off.
It sounds a bit drastic, and so it is—for the flies.
“Zanthus”: Cannibalism wasn’t confined
to the northern abos. It is recorded that the unsuit-
ably named Merriman, one of the ringleaders in
the massacre of Faithfull’s men on the Ovens (Vic.)
in 1838, was credited with having eaten his mother,
and certainly in later life he was seen having a
bit of Chinaman’s shoulder. Memman’s brother,
old Ned, killed two wives and roasted one of them.

BOY AND BIRD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Winter is over and Spring has come,
What shall they sing of, bird and boy?
Of bud and blossom, of peach and plum,
And leaves that dance with a new-found joy?
Of dewdrops jewelling flowering trees,
Where beetles murmur ar.d brown bees hum?
Oh i:0, oh r.o, it is not of these
They’ll sing together when Spring has come!
Then what shall they sing of, boy and bird,
When Spring hies hither and Winter’s done,
And all the folk of the wood are stirred
To life and warmth by the kindly sun?
What theme of themes shall they cry aloud
With silver warble and golden word,
When glories gather and pleasures crowd,
And magic mellows them, boy and bird?
One theme they will carol when leaves unfurl,
And Spring falls heir to her green estate.
The boy shall sing of a blushing girl,
The bird shall sing of a woodland mate;
And life shall bloom like a golden growth
With dewdrops shining, each drop a pearl,
And love make pliant the hearts of both,
The woodland mate and the blushing girl.

A New Novel by
ARTHUR WRIGHT
Australia’s Most Popular Novelist.
“FETTERED BY FATE”
Years ago, when Mr, Wright had written only a couple of
novels reviewers hailed him as "a new Nat Gould. The
critics were right; Mr. Wright’s novels proved instantaneous
successes, and all his earlier novels are still enjoying
regular sales. Encouraged by his earlier successes, Mr.
Wright wrote a dozen other novels, and here is the complete
list to date: —
“KEANE OF KALGOORLIE.” “THE HATE OF A HUN.”
(New revised editions of both will soon be ready.)
“IN THE LAST STRIDE.” “THE BREED HOLDS GOOD.”
“A GAME OF CHANCE.” “GAMBLERS GOLD.”
“A ROGUE’S LUCK.” “UNDER A CLOUD.” “RUNG IN.”
“WHEN NUGGETS GLISTENED.” “A ROUGH PASSAGE.”
“OVER THE ODDS.” “THE OUTLAW’S DAUGHTER.”
“FETTERED BY FATE,” the latest, is one of Mr. Wright s best
novels. Another new novel, “The Colt from the Country,’ is now
in the press.
Every novel has a strong sporting interest. Mr. ries have
snort-ins- writer has become known in England, and lnqu.in, m
recently been made by a leading London publishing house seeking
English rights of his novels.

It is easy to shave as closely and cleanly as a barber if

of practice have taught him how to strop his razor to
the highest pitch of keenness. With the “ Valet Auto-
Strop you can obtain such an edge every morning,
without serving an apprenticeship.
Built right into the razor is a self-stropping device which
puts the keenest edge on the blade. Half-a-dozen
strokes on its strop is all that is needed. Nothing to
unscrew-no separate stropping machine—uo constant
expense for new blades.
And the “ Valet" Auto Strop is as easy to Mean as to

"Te Pana”: The dinkum Maori tattoo
artist who did his work with a chisel has long
-one the way of the huia, the moa and the Liberal
Government. In all Maoriland there are only a
dozen or so males whose faces bear his markings,
and even they are but poor imitations of the mnko
of a hundred years ago. Chin-tattooing is still
common amongst the women, steel needles being
used to do the work in place of the old stone
chisel. In the Urewera country, the last of the
purely-Maori districts, the artist does his work for
“a cohplerquid” a chin.

"S.T.S.”: The origin of “ringer” for the
best man in a shearing-shed was threshed out
in The Bulletin 20 years ago or more. The weight
of evidence favored the theory that it came from
the game of Ipioits— the long-distance, iron variety
where most shots merely get near the pin, b,ut
the perfect one surrounds it, and is a “ringer.”

got there?” “Just a couple of kittens-,” he said;
“their mother died at a hut 1 was in 0 n the
Murray, and 1 couldn’t leave ’em to die.” He took
i tin of condensed milk out of his pocket and
diluted some of the contents with water in the
lid of the billy and gave the two-furry little atoms
a lap; then he put them carefully back Into the
can and moved oft. He had carried them over 200

“Wessel” : The Golden Gate of San Fran-
cisco (U.S.A.) deserved its name when this wandering
Aussie saw it. awhile ago. The Australian coast
wattles (Amcto longifolia ) in the Golden Gate Park
were in full bloom and their yellow masses could
be seen for miles. ■ These wattles grow 40ft. high
or more in California, a deal bigger than in their
own country.

“Aussie-ite”: At Broken Hill recently
rats have twice gnawed through the lead casing of

“Def Stone”: It was a well-deserved
tribute that Prof. Harrison, of the Sydney Uni.,
lately paid to the natural history work of Harry
Rurrill, who owns a few square miles up Manilla
(N.S.W.) way, and has done some .splendid field-
work in the study of our fauna, lie has succeeded
in the -difficult task of keeping the platypus alive
in captivity, and his observations have added a lot
to the rather scanty knowledge of that creature. He
finds that in the development of its young, as in
other respects, the platypus is a link between the
birds find the mammals. The birds lav eggs con-
taning the mere germ of the future bird.' and this is
developed after the egg is laid and before it is
hatched. The young platypus is developed while the

egg is still in the body of its parent, though not to
the same extent that the young of the marsupial is
when it is put in the pouch. The platypus some-
times lays as many as three eggs, and Bun-ill lias
found a family of triplets all alive and kicking. He
is now working on the problem of the curious
‘poison-spur” of the male platypus, about the use
of which little is known. He is a fine photographer,
and nothing has yet been done in Australia to beat
his animal studies. At devising traps to take ani-
mals unhurt, too, he is little short of a genius.

“liae-akiaki” : Can some Maoriland or other
Abo. tell me if the morepork wages war on bats?
In M.L. there are only two species of bats, the
long- and the short-tailed. The latter is very rare,
and only to be found here; but of late years both
species have been decreasing rapidly. If this is due
to a natural enemy it must be a nocturnal bird.
Is it the owl or an introduced diseasS?
"Alex.”: Can anybody oblige me with the
origin of “Not too dusty” ? I met a .friend the
other day who had just returned from a trip to
North Queensland, including a visit to tlie mystery
lake, Barrine, on the Atherton Tableland. “What
did you think of Lake Barrine?” I asked. “Oil.
not too dusty,” he replied.
fekyrider : Travelling through the pretty
country to the west of the Wollondilly River
(N.S.W.), I stopped for a spell at the gate of as
neat a little farm as I have seen in all my wander-
ings. The house stood back from the road in a
spotless gravelled yard, some seven or eight sleek
cows were chewing the cud under a clump of big
kunajongs, and a sturdy graceful girl was groom-
ing one of the Jerseys. I pushed open the gate,
asked for a drink of milk and got it. Coyly yield-
ing to persuasion, 1 took a second dose, and found
courage to ask the lass if she ran the establishment.
She owned up, and introduced me to the cows, who
turned out to be the chummiest animals I have ever
shaken hands with. “1 treat them all as if they
were my sisters,” she said. “Would you like to
see their pictures?” Of course I would, and we
went into the “front room,” where, in place of
the usual pictures of dad and mum and uncle Harry,
there bring photos of every cow- and calf on the
place. “Ho you do all the farm work yourself?”
1 asked. “Most of it,” was the answer. “The
boys do some when I can make them. I’ve got seven
bi others, she added pensively, “but there are times
when I wish they were cows.”

“Cubbon Budgeree”: The crow—and there
are vast numbers of him —is an honored citizen on the
watershed of the Victoria River (N.T.). He is
distinctly an asset, his job being tick-eradication,
which he carries on with his customary sagacity.
He doesn t follow- cattle while they are feeding,
but waits at water or camping-place till the mob
is resting, and then gets to work. It is quite com-
mon to see blood running from cattle before he
is through his meal. But “Kelly” doesn’t enjoy
the job more than the old pikers, who chew the
cud of contentment during the process,
“Wingo”: We found two dead sheep in
a big hollow log. They had evidently crawled in
out of the sun and had not had the sense to back
out again. The log was just a shell, and they had
gone up about 6ft. and poked their noses out of
a crack at the side and stayed there.
“D.F.”: The abo. didn’t mix his drinks
because mostly' he had only one; but he objected
to mixing his foods. In many kitchen-middens,
both in Yie. and the Speck, the various species
of shells are carefully laid out in separate heaps.
At Adventure Bay (Tas.) there is a pile about a
yard ih diameter composed entirely of the claws and
shells of crayfish. Round about are limpets, mussels
and other shells, but not one of them is mixed irp
with the remains of the crayfish suppers.
“Adrian” : Bloggs, who owned a selection
and a few cows near us, decided to take unto him-
self an offsider for the cows. So he visited eld
Thornton, who had three daughters, all in “rhe
sere and y'ellow,” but renowned as milkers. Bloggs
sat for about five minutes
gazing at the blessed
three. Then he singled
out the eldest and said
abruptly: “Come out and
see me ’orse.” She came.
Then, quite as abruptly:
“What about getting mar-
ried ?” The answer was
equally to the point:
“Yairs, orright.” Being
asked afterwards why he
picked the eldest, Bloggs
replied: “Well, ver see,
two of me cows has got

'ands are big enough to
milk a water-bag. Yairs,

“Boomerang”: A freak haunting Northern
Australian waters is known locally as the telephone-
fish. Of medium-size, it has
a long tendril, to which
is affixed a floating, mush-
room-like “receiver” of
clirty-white jelly. The fish
itself is always far beneath
the surface, but every
sound in the air seems to
be carried to the fish per
medium of this ear or re-
ceiver. I have proved its
sensitiveness by trying to
quietly steer a boat along-
side the floating jelly, afid
it has invariably dis-
appeared before I could get
within ten yards of it.

breast to breast with another man at football he
will realise what chance the falcon would have with
a laige bird like a wild swan, or even a goose or
duck, the latter heavier and solider than any falcon.
“Malleeite” says he has always seen attacks made
from beneath. \\ ell. the downward swoop of the
falcon is proverbial, and if the attack is dodged, the
attacker has to climb up into position again as an
aeroplane does. Some of the smaller hawks, like the
merlin and sparrowhawk, run down their prey from
behind. "Pick ’ is equally wrong in saying that the
falcon strikes with the wing. That delicate mechan-
ism would snap like, a carrot with the force of the

MY LAND OF LONG AGO.

The trees grow tall in Gippsland,
Where laughing birds make mirth ;
But blackened logs in Gippsland
Lie heavy on the earth.
The scrub grows thick in Gippsland,
Sweet musk amid the fern ;
But grasses sown In Gippsland
Are thinning but in turn.
The rain comes down in Gippsland
Through day to night again ;
But roads are deep in Gippsland
Where bullocks heave and strain.
The children trudge in Gippsland,
Though cattle frisk and run;
for children’s hours in Gippsland
Are longer than the sun.
The hills are steep in Gippsland,
The valleys quickly turn;
But tracks are blocked in Gippsland
With timber off the burn.
Vet take me hack to Gippsland :
All other fires burn low,
And hearths are warm in Gippsland,
My land of long ago.
I IS MANIA.

Tet Japan labors under severe handicaps as
a manufacturing country. ...
In the first place the supply of raw material is
pitifully meagre. With the exception of silk Japan
has in store hardly any raw material worth} ot
mention. She produces no wool or cotton, and has
onlv a limited store of iron. With the exception
of coal, in which alone she is fairly independent
at least for the present—Japan depends lor throe
indispensable factors of modern industry mpstlv on
foreign supply. Scarcity of iron, in particulai, is
a notable weakness of Japan as an industrial nation.
It is not mentioned that steps have been
taken to correct these handicaps. Korea
alone has enough coal and iron to keep the
industmes of Japan go mg for many genera-
tions. Shantung is famous for its high-
grade coal, and Shan-si, which is virtually
Japanese, has almost unlimited iron depos.is.
The truth is the drift from Japan is a more
complicated phenomenon than Messrs.
Iyenaga and Sato care to admit. The
growing population could be absorbed easily
enough, if not in Japan proper, at any
rate in the Mikado’s oversea dominions; in
Manchuria, where Japan has a controlling
interest in the chief railways, and in
Northern China, where every second big con-
cession is Japanese. But in westernising
the Japanese people their Government has
set them against the social conditions which
were good enough for their ancestors. No
modern Jap will compete as a worker against
a Chinese or a Korean; and a steadily-
increasing number even decline the strenu-
ous and frugal life involved in competing
with other Japanese. This is the cons.der-
able section which is pouring into America
and which is anxious to come to Australia.
There are only about 5000 Japanese in Aus-
tralia at present, thanks to our Alien Immi-
gration Restriction legislation. Of late
years America has been attracting them at
the rate of, roughly, 10,000 per annum:
180,000 have arrived in the last 80 years,
and 125,000 of these settled in California.
The authors of “Japan and the California
Problem” have a simple method of solving
the difficulty which this immigration pre-
sents : it is miscegenation. Their argu-
ment is that the Japanese are assimilable
people capable of becoming completely
Americanised. The obstacle presented by
the dual nationality of the immigrants and
their children can ( be adjusted Jby a diplo-
matic arrangement. All Japanese -would
then become eligible for U.S. citizenship.
They would inter-niarry with the women-
folk of their new 1 fellow-countrymen ; and as
the common standard of culture and ideals
of Asia and the West came closer and closer
with the spread of civilisation, the mingling
of the yellow and the white would appear
niore natural. And ultimately the whole-
wnHfl would accept it. Such are the
theories which these two Japanese professors
put forward, evidently with high hopes that
they will be accepted generally.
One powerful American objection to
acceptance was indicated not many days ago
when, according to. a New York cable, a
colony of Japs were given so many hours to
get out of a district in which they had been
undercutting white workers. The Japan-
ese farm-worker or operative may not be
able to live more cheaply than a Man-
churian coolie, but he can beat a white Cali-
fornian in this respect without turning a
hair. The American outside California
(which, as above stated, has about two-thirds
of all the Japs in the U.S.) does not know-
much from personal experience of the Mon-
gol races; and’ what he does know is rather
favorable. The few Japs in the Eastern
States, for example, are civil, well-behaved,
splendid servants. But the Americans are
suffering from a severe form of race-shock as
a result of their negro problem, and it is not
a complaint which tim.e is going to cure.
There w'as a period when the nigger stayed
more or less in the South. He is doing that
still in great numbers, of course. In the
State of Miss ss'ppi the blacks now outnum-
ber the whites by four to three. But the
colored man is also swarming into the
Chicago packing business and the Pittsburg
steel industry. There are 120,000 blacks in
New York alone. All over the U.S. the tra-
ditionally feeble unions are being menaced
by non-union negro labor, and the colored folk
are growing in numbers, by natural increase,
at the rate of 100,000 yearly. Is it likely
the Americans are going to superimpose on
their black racial tragedy . a yellow one?
They acquired the African black in igno-
rance ; but if they accepted Asiatic races it
would be with full knowledge of the mean-
ing of the Act, and they are aware that pos-
terity would not forgive such a betrayal.
There is an alternative to the immigration of
Japanese to countries like America and Aus-
tralia. and it. is one which calls for a smaller
sacrifice on the part of the Japs than their
statesmen and publicists arc demanding of
the whites. It is that they should level up
the industrial standard of the highly produc-
tive ree : ons which they control in Asia, in-
stead of employing their capac'tv to tod long
hours on a scanty supply of food to outclass
Caucasian workers in the onlv labor mar-
kets which the latter possess. The Jap may
be as straight, as brave and as b"ainy as the
American or the Australian.- H : s national
standards of culture and so forth may be
as high as theirs. But those things are all
beside the po ; nt: and the fact that even cos-
Tnopol’tnn.and educated Japanese cannot see
it is a fair measure of the difficulty of the
Pacific problem.

The Lawson Family
There is a suggestion that Henry Lawson
is of gipsy origin. He himself has given
it by the number of times he has referred
to the subject in his poetry. Our kin are
many in N. S. Wales, all descendants of
John and Ann Albury. who came to. Aus-
tralia when Mulgoa flourished, and were
tillers of tire land. Here at Mulgoa, Henry,
their son —“handsome Harry”—met and
married the refined English girl, Harriet
Winn, and then crossed over the ranges to
Guntawaug, the station of Robert Rouse.
There Louisa, our mother, was born, in 1846,
and baptised in Rouse’s drawing-room by
Archdeacon Giinther. It is sa„d she pulled
the parson's nose during the ceremony. She
married when barely 18 “Refer the Swede,”
who was really a native of Norway, son of
a teacher of navigation. Peter was a stu-
dent of navigation, and on a trip for prac-
tical experience. lie was then a lad of 18.
Unfortunately for himself he contracted gold
fever, and it did not leave him for over 20
years. ' He and Louisa Albury met at
Golden Gully. One of Henry’s earliest
poems was a description of this guliy—it
was published in the Christmas Number of
The Bulletin, 1888. The young couple
“followed the diggings” with dray and horse,
and for the next few years lived in a tent.
Henry has given his first impression of life;
the family was living then in a single room
with a tent behind and a tree in front. That
tree, which impressed his mind in a way he
has never forgotten, had its signficance, for *
Pipeclay was afterwards named Eurunderee,
the native word for a single tree.
Some of any kin resent this suggestion of.
a gipsy stigma. I did, too, for a consider-
able time, but. upon reading the history of
thcv gipsites-L-there are a considerable number
of books upon the subject—l have somewhat
reconciled myself. I certainly have to admit
that rrmny of the : r characteristics are idpn-
tleap witb those of my own family—even to
yot'Ke-inak'ng. But .whereas .the women of
gipsy race are g’fted. not the men, the men
of our race are the stronger. Still tradition
says if a gipsv man has the gift it is super-
abundant. My mother, the late Louisa
Lawson, had no knowledge of the history of
the interestmg and nne’ent race; yet. strange
to say, stories she so of f en told me are iden-
tical with mnnv which the gipsies nbver
weary of repeating.
GERTRUDE LAWSON.
Carthage and Ireland
During the second Punic War Carthage
was bigger than Sydney; at the end of the
third Punic War it was no bigger than Parra-
matta. I am pretty sure that in the mean-
time a good many Carthaginians had sought
shelter in Ireland. Spain was not safe;
ne.tner was Caul; Africa to the south was
uninviting; Ireland tooaed a happy and
secured sUelter. Ttiere is no proof of this;
but tiiere is a good deal of circumstantial
evidence. An old Irish story tells of an in-
cursion of foreigners fleeing from Africa to
escape the curse pronounced upon Dam.
Surety that is the va.e of Carthaginian re-
fugees as it came- to be told when tae Chris-
tian schools had made the Old Testament a
background for all ancient events. But it
is the alphabet which presents the
strongest evidence. It is generally
supposid that a Cheek alphabet came
through Gaul to Ireland from tae
Phoenician colony at Marseilles; but the diffi-
culty in the way of accepting such a belief
is (1) that the Irish alphabet is not the
.Greek alphabet; and (2) that the Irish
alphabet must almost certainly have been in
use in Ireland before the peoples of Gaul
learned letters.
In very ancient times the Irish carved on
pillars of stone what are known as Ogham
inscriptions. These writings are of native
origin and form a true alphabet. Tliey have
been found in quantity all over Ireland and
occasionally in scattered places in the west
of Britain; but they ‘do not reach the con-
tinent of Europe. Ancient legends constantly
refer to writings in Ogham. iNow, something
stopped the development of the Ogham writ-
ing at a very early period ; for a people once
possessing a true alphabet are sure to rapidly
develop it. What more likely than that fhe
stoppage was due to the introduction of
Phoenician characters at a date possibly as
early as that of the building of Carthage
itself?
Again, the Greek alphabet has 22 main
characters, with the vowels scattered
through it; Irish has only 18 main
characters, and the vowels are arranged by
themselves after the consonants. The Egyp-
tian writing from which the Phoenician alpha-
bet sprang used no vowels. These were an
addition made afterwards when writing came
to languages the roots of whose words were
vowels. .The Phoenician language, like most
of its neighbors, had consonantal roots simi-
lar to those of modern Arabic. So the infer-
ence is that the alphabet reached Ireland at
a time when there were only 13 characters
in it; and that the vowels were added to meet
the needs of the language and naturally were
placed at the end of the list. Further, H is
hot a character in Greek, but merely a breath-
ing mark ; in Ireland it is the letter “Nath.”
Only one letter in the Irish alphabet corres-
ponds in name to that of any other language.
It is the first letter, and its name is “Beth.”
the exact Phoenician name and the one still
remaining in Hebrew as the designation of B.
There is nothing in all this that can be
called proof; but there is enough to estab-
lish a broad foundation for conjecture.
Objection may be raised on the ground of
the absence of Phoenician remains in Ireland
to any supposition that the Carthaginians
went to that country in great numbers. The
answer is not difficult. Ireland at that period
had nothing to learn that seemed worth
learning from the Asiatics. Their alphabet
had already been absorbed and improved
upon ; in metjal work and kindred arts the
Irish were then- superors; in government and
economies the slave-driving traders had no-
thing to teach a free people; in architecture
their knowledge required a backing of infinite
chean which was not to be found. The
probabilities are that the refugees became
townspeople and small traders; and of the
coming of such only a faint memory w T ould
remain in after years. Some of the dark
Irish faces found to-da.v in the south and
west—faces usually supposed to indicate a
Spanish or-gin—may much more likely nrove
to be the last remaining token of the living
Carthaginians who fled from the sword of
Rome and not from the curse Ham,

Einstein
Manchester has had the privilege of hear-
ing Professor Einstein give Ins first lecture
on “Relativity'’ outside of" Continental
Europe; and before he set out his revolu-
tionary conclusions at the Manchester Uni-
versity (June 9) the degree of Doctor of
Science was conferred upon him by the
Vice-Chancellor. About a thousand people
were present.
Einstein is the first German of note to
visit England—at least publicly—since the
war. He came from New York, where he
had been lecturing on behalf of the con-
templated Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
For, of course, the Professor is a Jew ; he is
stout and broad-shouldered, with a moustache
covering his upper lip and trying to hide
the genial look he has. His manner is un-
assuming, and in private, I am told, very
charming. For about 45 minutes, without
referring to a note, he held us spellbound.
He is not like the usual academic lecturer,
being not averse to jocular analogies. Sev-
eral times during his speech he sent a laugh
around the hall by his quaint contrasts.
His German was of the simplest, and he was
intelligently followed by the audience. His
reception was obviously a pleasure to him —
an “act of great-hearted Liberalism in diffi-
cult political times,” he remarked.
For my own part I confess I had been
drawn to him by the fact that while in
America he had appeared as a musician,
playing both violin and piano in order to
obtain funds for the Jerusalem University.
Nor was lrs nbiving of the student class, if
we are to accept views from certain sources
on the o<her s.ue. He cannot speak English
at all, and is unable to express himself suffi-
ciently in French. So to help the project
he has much at heart lie turned to the univer-
sal language ‘of music, not making the mis-
take that Maeterlinck fell into of attempt-
ing a discourse in an unaccustomed tongue.
An Australian interest was given to the
proceedings by the appearance of Professor
Bragg, formerly of Adelaide, to move the
vote of thanks. This distinguished scientist,
whose experiments in physics have made
him world-famous, generously confessed that,
although the failure of physical phenomena to
conform to Euclid’s laws had been observed
nearly a hundred years ago. Dr. Einstein
had made the apparent anomalies conform
to a general principle.
MOSES BARITZ.
The Maid of France
Henry Molotiy on the old subject:—
Tn an otherwise admirable anoreciation of the
genius of Anutole France (R.P. 7/7/’2l) by “C.McL.”
is a paragraph which I cannot understand, unless it
was written to make the student of history stare
and gasp: “No serious reply has ever been made [to
Anatole France), for reply is impossible. Andrew
Lane corrected a few references, which France
smilingly accepted. .History will record him as
the first man who considered Joan of Arc by the
ordinary canons of historical criticism. If you
study for yourself the incredibly tiny authorities
upon which the legend is based you will probably
agree with me that A. France, out of his great
love and pity -for the poor child, has, If anything,
rather understated his case.”
The idea that the Maid was nothing more than
a crazy visionary was hoary with age before M.
France was born. In 1730 a certain Beaumarchais
described her as an enthusiast whose mind had been
filled with visions and revelations by one Brother
Richard, who had convinced Joan and three other
women that they were saints. France’s bulky book
is very much of the nature of a long sermon on the
text, supplied by Beaumarchais. The conclusions
come to are practically identical, if we omit certain
details too dirty for the dainty hands of M. France
to touch even in gloves.
A reply to M. France was possible, was attempted,
and was given once for all in the late Andrew Lang’s
“Maid of France.” In matters of scholarship
Lang’s little finger was of greater' substance than
the loins of Anutole Fra nee; and he demonstrates
that France’s book is honeycombed with what may
euphemistically be called inaccuracies. Some of
these are very remarkable; but the last instance
on the last page of the Notes will serve as well as
another to illuminate M. Anatole’s skill in. literary
embroidery. Citing the official Prods, he uses these
v.-ords: “She asked the pardon of her judges, of the
English King- Henry, of the English royal princes.”
The Proces itself says: “She begged right humbly
also the forgiveness of all sorts and conditions of
men, both of her own party and of her enemies;
asking for their prayers, forgiving them for the
evil they had clone her.” No mention here, you see,
of English kings and princes!
The verdict of history upon the whole -of the facts
was given by A. Hassall in 1918 (“France Medneval
and Modern”). And the conclusion of' the whole?
matter is this: “After her appearance the French
fought as never before, and all attempts to belittle her
influence have absolutely failed.” Yet 1 agree that
M. Anutole France’s “Vie de Jeanne d’Arc” is a
masterpiece.
The inky Way
Mrs. G. A. Bell, of Coochin Coochin, lias finished
a novel, “Under the Brigalows,” mainly picturing
station life. ' Cooehin Coochin is one of Queens-
land’s show places: Edward P. stayed there during
his run through Bahanaland, and wanted to stay
longer;' !'
“Coot”: Thg A'ustraliah Literature Societj-, which,
under the presidency of Rev. J. Mathew, meets
monthly in Kurlong’s studio, is to have a monthly
magazine of its very own. The society is more
flourishing than it has ever been in the past, and
its members are beisg asked for additional subscrip-
tions to grease the wheels of the new venture.
“S.y.” : • Hattie Knight (R.P. 2y/t/’2l) makes
too loud an outcry about the cant* of art, which,
after all, is very like every other cant. Practically
every profession and every trade l, habits cant, and
affected and ridiculous as it may sound to the out-
sider, it serves, in the main, a useful purpose. Cer-
tain phrases twisted more or less from the signifi-
cance they have in ordinary speech go to make the
artist’s cant, and the cant of tinker, tailor, soldier,
sailor, rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief is
made up in much the same way. Each term has
its peculiar meaning, conveying a precise idea to
those familiar with its use, an idea that could not
be conveniently conveyed in any other way. The
“wonderful barrage of jargon” the lady com-
plains of is tiie language of experience, and the
artist using it is not necessarily an affected ass, nor
is he as unintelligible to the uninitiated as many a
Geordie or Cousin Jack miner I have heard talking
the cant of the mines. An etcher using his terms
of trade is talking Greek half the time to the curi-
ous stranger, but his “jargon” and “catch phrases”
are the best vehicles he knows for impressing the
notion he wishes to publish. The “average subur-
banite” is not more bewildered by art cant than by
literary cant, or legal cant, and not half as much
as by medical cait. which is deliberately manufac-
tured from dog Latin with malice prepense to be-
wilder and deceive.

Where alien trees of even growth make shade:
Above the glitter of Mill seas at dawn
Vries of far things whereof we are afraid.

Stands like a benediction and caress,

P. O. M.
Charles Dickens, who merely walked across
the screen in the him version of “Milestones,”
is to occupy the centre of it in a new play
written by "Dagonet” Sims. It starts with
his early struggles, blacking-factory and all,
very much as told in "David Coppertield,”
aud follows him up through lus big successes
to his sudden death. Suns guarantees that
the novelist’s rather unhappy married life
is handled in a way that can give no offence
to the descendants living. ,
Father J. .1. Malone, of Ashby, Geelong,
who says Archbishop iVlannix is strong m
the running for the Dublin See, is no ordi-
nary parish priest who may be making a
guess, but is a man closely in touch with
headquarters. Incidentally, he is one of
the orators of the Catholic Church in Vic.
When P.F. of Clifton Hill he could till
St. l’at.’s any time he went over to
preach there if a two-line advt. in the papers
tipped his appearance. He writes graceful
prose and verse, and has published “The
Purple East,” descriptive of a trip iu Pales-
tine. Next to the breviary' the books lie
keeps nearest his hands arc of Australian
authorship.
Professor Ernest Scott, of Melbourne Uni.,
who presided over the recent conference of
Australian metropolitan daily newspaper
proprietors and the A,J.A. on matters of
interpretation of award and agreement, was,
prior to 1898, a reporter and sketch-writer
on Melbourne Herald. Ilis daily summary
of the first session of the Federal Conven-
tion at Adelaide (1897) was brilliantly done;
he had a choice of jobs after that, and
selected State Hansard so that he might
revel in literature in recess. His “Terre
Napoleon” and other Australian historical
works won him his professorship, though he
had no Uni. trimmings to his name.
“Side Switch”; Re “Heat Coil” (B.
dO/0/’2l) on the so-called picnics abroad. It
is a pity that the idea is not more fully devel-
oped and arrangements made for the regular
inter-change of technical officers throughout
the States and abroad.- “Heat Coil” admits
that bis smart Sydney juniors profited by
the trip and tuition received in Geelong
(Vic.) under the Yanks to the extent that
they more than held their own when they
came home. How some apparatus works
on the other side is often a source of won-
der to the technical staff. We get the
"latest” direct from the factory, with the
prints, etc., only to find sometimes that it is
unworkable. Incidentally, we are building
apparatus here equal in every way to the
best imported, only cheaper; but local manu-
facture is not encouraged.
"B.” : George Buller, Melbourne’s ancient
showman, has a yarn of Sir William Don,
who was introduced to Victoria by George
Coppin. Don was on a country tour with
Edmund Holloway. It was midsummer and
hot, So the pair decided that, at the end of their
last performance in Oastlemaine, they would
drive to Garisbrook, about four miles away.
1 Jon's carriage, which had been brought from
England, was hitched to .a pair of good nags,
and Edmund sat alongside to point out
the objects of interest that were, visible on
a bright summer night. After a short run
there was a halt for champagne, and on
resuming they began to pass a succession
of large buildings which Holloway explained
were the homes of various <'hirnsides, Aus-
tins and other squatters. After about an
hour’s driving, with more adjournments,
and still no end to the “mysterioush pro-
shession of mansionth,” the groom was sent
over to a neighboring edifice to make in-
vestigations, and returned with the inform-
ation that it was a grandstand, and that an
inspection of the tracks showed they had
done about six laps round a racecourse.
“Harrison O.” meets a few:— i
I thick Billjim. with his airy furphies anent
sheep-runs and kangaroo-studs, must be held largely
responsible.; anyway, it appears to be now a fixed
article of belief with a vast army of ■ earbiters in
London that an Australian is a legitimate target
for their skill. Fleet-street especially is full of
people who talk affectionately of “dear old Aussie"
as a preliminary to asking one’s advice in regard
to their temporary final cial embarrassment. “Yes,
deah boy,” one of the tribe assured me, “I spent
seven years out there, and, by gad, 1 wish I was
there, now!.” A request for details elicited the in-
formation that he was “on a sheep ranch outside
Sydney,” and also did “a hit of gold mining.” He
was proceeding to supply further mendacities when
1 cut him short with an offer of two bob on
condition that be would immediately cease his
reminiscences. He promptly closed with the offer.
All practitioners of the art a-feuT so reasonable.
There are some who decline to fojrgct. the glories
of the open-air life “out there” tor a smaller sum
than 10s. One night during the run of “On Our
Selection" at the Lyric, I was in Bert Bailey’s
dressing-room before the; show, jvjmn the call-boy
mentioned that “Mr. ——, of Australia,” desired
audience with Bert. Mr. , who. sported spats,
a monocle and a suit of about the 1915 vintage,
had merely called round to shake Bert by the hand
for the sake of old times, as it appeared that Albert
had been one of the hf-roes of Mr. —-’s youth.
Bailey, who was busy .plastering his countenance
with grease-paint, did not do much in the way of
rendering first-aid to the conversation, so I felt
called upon to behave like a little gentleman. We
talked very affably while Bert continued to mess
about with his make-up, Mr. , it appeared,
had left Australia in 1914 “to join rny old regi-
ment,” but for some years previously had been a
regular visitor to the jolly old King’s. I am sure
Mr. was very grateful to me for a casual
remark about Bailey's magnificent Cavloy Drummle
in “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” which, of course,
he renumbered perfedtly. I recalled other of
Bert’s histrionic triumphs, and was about to men-
tion his much-discussed, performance of “Hamlet”
when the voice of the call-boy sopnded outside.
Mr, got a couple of free seats, which Certainly
was the least he deserved.

“Exul” on the thyroid operation:—
I support “Bio Ghent” (B. 14/7/’2l) in his con-
tradiction of “Gregor’s” statement that the operation
of thyroid transference is done almost weekly in
Australia. During the past 10 years (with the
exception of the last few months) I have been
in almost daily contact with one or more of the
chief hospitals- in Sydney, in varying capacities,
from medical student to honorary surgeon. hi
that time 1 have never seen the operation nor
have I heard of its performance by any of my
teachers or colleagues. All with whom I have dis-
cussed ttie matter have agreed that it has been
performed sufficiently often in the past to prove that
it has no permanent therapeutic value.

of motor-’buses running from the foot of
Spencer-street bill along the wharves and
round the Victoria Dock. The ’buses are
second-hand models from London, identical
with those used by the London General Omni-
bus Co., two-storeyed machines with a fair
turn of speed. It is certain no more electric
tramways will be built or extended in Mel-
boui ne for many a day. They don’t pay—
there will be a deficit of nearly £lOO,OOO on
this year’s working of the Melbourne tram-
ways. The despised cable-cars are bearing
the electrics on their back, and the latter
are eat.ng up the profits. In a few years
the Tramway Board will own a big fleet of
motor-'buses.
“Stargazer”: There are thin actors, too.
One of the thinnest was Fred Storey, a
dancing comedian, who came here with one
of the earliest of the Gaiety burlesques.
Storey was so long and so slim that once in
the course of a wild dance he threw himself
into a knot, and had to suspend operations
while his brother actors untied him. A
scene-painter’s assistant once knocked Storey
kicking with a pot half-full of paint. “S clp
me, boss,” lie said, “I hadn’t any idear Mr.
Storey.was there! He must ha’ bin standin’
edge on.” Case dismissed. Another thin
actor was here with Asehe, playing Shak-
spearean clowns. One day he failed to appear
on time at rehearsal, ami Oscar yelled for
him. Someone was sent to hunt up the miss-
ing corned an, but returned presently with-
out tidings of the stray. “Can’t see him any-
where. sir,” sn ; d the seeker. “Look again,”
cried Asehe. “Look in the mousetrap !”
The man who sang of mother
It was a drizzly night, and the- pub :;t the train-
termiuua was - a disreputable-looking sha.tv making
doleful noises; but having a further two miles to
walk I entered in search of stimulant.
A flickering gas-jet hung from a crooked pipe in
tha ceiling, faintly illuminating the sloppy bar
counter and sending sickly shadows across the mud-
and-sawdust-covered. floor. A barmaid with a cold-
pinlc nose and a neck escaping from a thin over-
filled blouse leant against the shelves; while on the
public side a large man with trousers suspended
perilously about' his waist stood swaying in the
throes of doleful, alcoliclic harmony.
When he had negotiated “A Boy-ee’s Best Fri-end
Is .’s Mother-r-rr” I had to either have the relief of
hearing my own voi.ee or abandon my gin and
peppermint and flee.
“I-Imp, poor fellow! Didn’t he ever have a
mother;” I ventured.
“Er ’ ’e ’ad. But she’s seriously ill in
i’orspital,” the pnle-pink-nosed lady replied, without
shifting hei‘ gazo-ifrom the window.
.“Well, well, poor-fellow 1” I murmured in my best
coffln 7 siti A'fhanner. “Kow I understand your kind
sympathy with his somewhat noisy manifestations of
bereavement.”
“Manifestations me nothin’!” ejaculated the lady.
“’E’s alwiz like than w’en ’e’s drunk. An’ larst
Sunday ’e booted in two uv ’er ribs, th’ dirty swine!”
she concluded.
After that I hurried off to take the deceased
alderman’s measurements and get back to our
funeral parlors for the night. It seemed more
cheerful.

“Moe” : In the early days of the war about
16 Hetmans were permitted, after the sur-
render of German New Guinea, to remain on
Witu Island as plantation owners and em-
ployees, all of them having taken an oath to
refrain from acts of war. In spite of this
oath a wireless plant was rigged up some-
where on Witu, and with its assistance the
business of smuggl.ng German escapees and
efugoes from Willielmshafen and Rabaul
t er to Dutch New’ Guinea went on. the
Navy was unable th stop it, for as soon as a
■ warship appeared in s,ght of the look-out on
the laslqiid the plant was dismantled and
stowed away in the hiding-place that nobody
had been able to find; and yet there were
reasons. ,wby the Germans should not be
removed just them But oue day a dirty,
battered-looking schooner hove in sight of
Witu and, Island fashion, every man in the
place assembled on the jetty to g”eet the
newcomer, who removed the last doubt as
to her identity by hoisting the German naval
► ensign as soon as she was; close enough for it
to be seen. On shore there was much specu-
lation as to wbjit she was and where she
£ame from,!, the genei&l opinion being that
'.slie -had Japanese in the Mar-
shalls or Carolines and made her way south.
EVentfially the schooner berthed at the jetty,
the black-bearded skipper having opened his
htfputlf only to reply to the salutations from
shore, 'and when she had been made fast
’1 thebe iv’as a rush to board her. Then the
’ Frit£<?S received the shock of their lives; for
when they’ were Till on board a score of
sailors, armed with rifle and bayonet and
'led by a lieutenant, appeared from below. In
a few words it was explained that a search
of the island would be made, during which
everybody would remain on the jetty. The
wireless- plant was unearthed in pbou£ 'five
minutes, and the first message sent was'one
to the waiting destroyed over the hofizon,
whofse lieutenant-commander, having grown
La' heard' v with trimmiELgs*for the occasion,,

"Engulfd in oceans deepest wave”
(Wagner s "Flying Dutchman”)
The great musician-pianist, violinist, singer
-moves us to profound depths of feeling
with his artistry; his emotional qualities. By
his technical dexterity we are merely awed—if we notice it at
all. One appeals to our inner sense of consciousness—intel-
lect, if you will—the other to our intelligence only. The New
model Beale Player-Piano is not so much an instrument of
tremendous technique as it is an instrument of interpretation
Technique it has, certainly,as all good musicianship rests on
a foundation of adequate technique. But its devices for in-
terpretive control of that technique provide the characteristic
which will interest you most. The New Beale is a musicianly
instrument supplying a means of expression to the inarticu-
late musician. It has no limitation for artistic playing other
than that of the operator’s own understanding of his theme.

Mr. Irwin Batty
Tells How Cuticura
Healed Eczema
“For some months I had been a
sufferer with eczema which con-
9K 3*
sisted of nothing but a mass
of red scaly eruptions. I
was covered from head to
foot with the awful com-
plaint which itched severe-
ly. The irritation caused me
to scratch it which caused
eruptions. My clothes irritated it
and the skin was awfully red and
inflamed.
“I suffered for some five months
using different remedies but found
no relief. On reading the Cuticura
advertisement I at once purchased
some Cuticura Soap and Cuticura
Ointment and following the direc-
tions carefully in two weeks I was
healed. ’ ’ (Signed) Irwin Batty, Locks-

"William Ernest”: A sobbing nipper came
borne from school in a Sydney suburb the
other day and complained to his Digger papa
that the teacher had wrongfully punished
him. Papa, with his rage well-cooked over-
night, tore along to the school next morning
to avenge the wrongs of his angel-child —
and found that the dominie was a D.gger
who had eobbered it. with him for a couple
of years. When he got home the kid got
another hiding.
“A.V.L.” : We had gone down together on
eight days’ leave to Paris, out of hellish hell
into heavenly heaven. We drifted apart before
half the first day was up; then, three days
later, 1 bumped him accidentally on the Bo.s
de Boulogne, and he certainly looked the
worse for wear. “Well, Bill,” 1 asked, ‘‘hay-
ing a good time? Seen anything yet?” Bill
propped himself up against a tree. "Don’
be (nic) shilly. ifav'n’ goo' time? Sheen
’ny tiling? Shay (hie), ’ve sheen Napoleon’s
tomb snix times already, an’—(hie) take a
peep at me!”
Alexander James McNeil has just quitted
the b.ggest timber concern in Westralia —
probably in all Australia —after being 14
years at the head of it. Following in the
footsteps of that Napoleon of sawmill man-
agers, the late Teesdale Smith, McNeil had
a hard row to hoe, but he brought youth
and enthusiasm to the implement, and, backed
by a fine stall, threw the sods as.de with
some effect. Smith never had to face tin-
labor troubles that McNeil bumped against
right from the jump; and that sort of thing
eats up the energies of most big industrial
organisers to-day.
“Sucrose”: The Hurrey sugar-cane cut-
ting-machine is to be tried once more. The
last attempt was in 1913-14. Now it has
been improved and is expected with one
man’s attention to cut over three acres per
day. Let the acre average 20 tons, one man
wilt cut 00 tons per day against the present
average of a bit over four tons. The wages
of the cutters for the Mulgrave Central Mill
last year, after paying for their cook and
allowing for lost t.me, worked out at £1
1 1 s. 4u. per day, or Ss. sd. per ton of cane.
If with a machine the mau is paid even
£3 per day the cost of cutting cane will be
Is. per ton plus interest on the capital
cost of the machine and an allowance for
wear and tear. Thus a ton of sugar will
be loaded with about 10s. for harvesting
instead of £4 or thereabouts. At one fell
swoop the cost of producing a ton of sugar
would come down £3 10s. Many people, in-
cluding the late Mr. Hurrey, have ruined
themselves trying to perfect a cane-cutting
machine, but the trouble always has been
that colored labor can cut cane for about.
lOd. to Is. a ton, and in colored-labor coun-
tries there has been no inducement to apply
machinery.
“Repat”: I raise my hat to some of the
womenkind of the men of the A.I.F. The
mother of two Diggers who died was a
widow when they enlisted and had 11 younger
children. Till her husband’s death she
had been a city-dweller; then she secured a
block in the country, cleared and cultivated
it with the help of her children, and to help
things through did an occasional day’s work
for more prosperous neighbors. A while ago.
she heard that the widow of a dead soldier
laid d.ed. leav.ng a live-year-old child w ta-
out any near relative. She promptly added it
to her flock of 11. Another was the wife of a
soldier who returned from the war a com-
plete invalid. Ilis brother, also an ex-soldier,
suicided ; but the lady, without any hesita-
tion, adopted his three children, adding them
to her cares, which included the sick husband.
A third case is even more heroic. Her ex-
Digger husband came home one day to find
a new child in the family group. “It’s yours,
Jack,” she explained, without temper, when
he demanded an explanation-—“something you
had forgotten.” From a letter she had learnt
of her husband’s backslidmg, and that the
mother of his child intended to leave it at
the borne now established for the little things
which casual Diggers left behind them in
England; and she had taken steps to have the
youngster brought to Australia. It was the
ex-D : gger himself who to’d me this tale;
and he said the wonderful woman had not
uttered a word of reproach.
“Morob’s” murderous meditations :
Those who know the ways a person may be mur-
dered by scientific methods with the greatest ease
and immunity from detection must often wonder
how often such methods have been employed with-
out anybody being any the wiser. Science numbers
in its catalogues hundreds of substances which will
cause death easily and quickly, and very often with-
out arousing suspicion, even in the trained mind,
and the great, majority of these substances are
available to all who have the technical knowledge
necessary to use them; that is, they are either
used for some other purpose or else they can be
prepared in the laboratory. And, moreover, thev
possess, most of them, this additional advantage
from the viewpoint of the murderer—-they are not
likely to be found by the analyst and demonstrated
to be the cause of death, supposing that something-
else, such as a strong motive, arouses suspicion of
foul play. In some cases so small a quantity needs
to be administered that there is nt> test delicate
enough to disclose the presence of tin) deadly agpnt;
in others it may not even be there in a form which
can be tested for, or it may be some perfectly harm-
less substance which has been taken ijito the system
under such circumstances that it is-*changed to one
of great destructiveness to life. Thorp are simple
and easily-prepared gases which, when inhaled into
the lurgs and absorbed into the blood, will bring
about death within a few minutes, and yet leave no
more indication of their work than an altered chemi-
cal composition of tine blood, a change which it is
doubtful whether the most expert investigator would
be likely to detect unless he had other outside indi-
cations to set him on the right track. So entirely
harmless a substance as white of eggs, or albumen,
may be injected into the blood-stream, with the
result that the victim will pass into the hereafter in
a few hours at the longest, -death being due to that
strange phenomenon known to medical science as
anaphylaxis, and for which as yet no accurate ex-
planation has been presented. There is also a class
of vegetable poisons so highly toxic that a quantity
of one of them running into four places of a decimal
of a gramme will kill a person. The only people
to whom they would be available would understand
their action to the uttermost degree, and since these
people do, from time to time, commit other crimes,
one wonders whether any of them have ever added
undetected murders to their list.

THE HALLMARK
OF THE
SMART WOMAN.
By MIMOSA.
be really smart a woman must con-
vey the impression of being daintily
fastidious regarding her personal
belonging and appearance. Her hair and
skin must look as though they retained the
appearance of youthful ness as a result of
.cleanliness and care. This is impossible
where the skin is spasmodically subjected
to experiments with all sorts of preparations.
The really smart woman will know what
she is using, and those who follow this
advice will use only simple,,pure ingredients
that can be procured in original packages.
If the chemist does not have what you want
he can easily obtain it for you, if you insist.
Clammy Hands —After washing your
hands, rub over them a little fuller’s earth
mixed with Orris, powdered. 1 think you
will find that this will help.
Beauty s Cheeks —Some face-creams
have a tendency to induce a growth of down
on the face. You can be on the safe sidei
by avoiding make-up creams, using instead
Mereolised Wax. It will protect your face
in motoring, and holds the powder perfectly.
It is the last word in smart, effective toilet
luxury.
Beautiful Lashes —The character of
the eyebrows and lashes certainly has much
to do with the beauty of the face. Get a
• package of Mennaline and apply a little at
night, brushing gently in the morning. This
will bung about a decided improvement in
the texture of your eyebrows and lashes.
Washing llaib Brushes —Scrupulous
cleanliness of the brushes is necessary if you
Wish to keep your hair in good condition. Tin-
best way is to use Curd Soap and a little
household ammonia in warm witter. Let
the brushes soak for a short time, then
wash them thoroughly. Rub as dry as pos-
sible and air in the sun.
Velvet Skin —Instead of several layers
of face-cream and powder try a solution of
Cleminite. Get a package, dissolve it iu
four ounces of water, and bathe the face
with the solution, patting it until it is quite
dry. You will have a “skin-like-velvet”
effect that will last for hours.
Scanty Locks— Thick glossy coils of your
own hair means devoting time to brushing
and scalp massage, also an occasional use
of hair tonic to keep the hair healthy. The
best and simplest tonic is Bay. Rum and
Boranium. Get a package of Boraniuin
and mix it with a j-pint of Bay Rum. This
will clear oil: any dandruff, and materially
aid in producing the desired result.
Large Pores and Blackheads —This is
the formula: Obtain a package of Stymol
tablets from the chemist’s and dissolve one
in a cup of hot water; after the effervescence
has subsided dab the face, using a small
sponge. The result is quite startling. This
is an excellent astringent. Used every day
will close the enlarged pores and prevent
wrinkles.
Bloom of Health —The use of rouge '■?
obvious is rather vulgar. You can get over
the difficulty and still have nice, rosy cheeks
by using Powdered Colliandum. Get a smaff
tin and apply a little with the tips of the
fingers. It is quite harmless, and its natural
color blends with the tint of the skin, so its
use can never be detected if it is applied
properly.
In Bad Odor——l do not know of any safe
way to check excessive perspiration, but you
can instantly kill the odor, which is not
only unpleasant to you but to those about
you, by applying a little powdered Pergol.
Cupid’s Bow —The best thing to use for
your lips is just a stick of soft Prolactum.
Rub this over the lips, and it will give them
the desired color and keep them soft and
fresh.
Superfluous Hair —You can remove that
undesirable down on your face with Phemi-
nol. Get a package and apply a little to the
hair, which can soon be rubbed off, leaving
the skin quite clear. It is also useful for
removing hair from the under-arm.
Lack-Lustre Hair —lf your hair is dull
and lustreless after a shampoo, you are
using something that is too soapy. Try just
plain Stallax. Get an original package, as
it is more economical. A teaspoonful in a
Cup of hot water for each shampoo is suf-
ficient. as it foams tremendously and rinses
off easily, leaving the hair lustrous and
fluffy, with a dainty suggestion of perfume.
Premature Greyness —This trouble may
he easily overcome and the hair restored
to its natural color by using concentrate of
Tammalite. Mix it with about the same
quantity of Bay Rum and applv with a small
sponge.— Advt.
Crocodile-catching in Malaya.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAW X.was breaking over the river, the
delicate, rosy tint in the sky just
showing over the top of the dark-
walls of the jungle. In the little Malay
village scattered along the bank, doors of
huts were beginning to open ; and the sleepy
occupants shivering in the cool of the morn-
ing air, and wrapped to the ears in their
sarongs lingered in the doorways before mak-
ing up their minds for the ni .rning plunge.
-Now one and then another saunters down
to the nver, and, tightening their sarongs
round them, take their dip and hurry back
to the huts. The children are well awake
by tins tune, and come capering down to the
water's edge, shouting and laughing. Pretty
little brown youngsters, the girls, all but the
smallest, who look like soft little brown dolls,
wear the sarong; the boys are shamelessly
naked. Soon all are splashing and shrieking
ecstatically in the warm water.
The sun has risen and the majority of the
children have quitted the water, when a
shriek of a different sort is heard from the
river, causing everyone to look round in
alarm. Little Ahmat, .swimming farther out
than the rest, is seen to raise himself for a
moment out of the water With horror and
pain depicted in his face; then some invisible
power drags him down and out of sight. The
children scramble out and rush screaming up
the bank, as the men, picking up their spears,
tear down to the river. But there is nothing
to be done. No spears can reach the loath-
some crocodile that has dragged the boy down
to the mud at the bottom of the stream.
Women catch up their children, some reliev-
ing their feelings by slapping their offspring
for doing what they have done regularly
every morning. The mother of the lost
Ahmat tills the air with her screams, beating
her breasts and tearing her hair. The men
gather in council, discussing the event.
An elderly man joins them, having come
.from the furthermost hut. All turn to him
eagerly ; for this is the pawang, or medicine-
man, of the village. Half-a-dozen men accost
him, all speaking at once, pointing to the
river, at Ahmat’s mother, and at the boy’s
father, who sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder leading up to his door, with his face
in his hands. The pawang listens for some
time in silence, merely nodding his head
wisely ; then, holding up his hand for silence,
he informs them that nothing can be done
till the afternoon. Meanwhile he will pray
to Allah and propitiate the river spirits. For
the Malay pawang divides his worship
between Allah and the spirits of «the jungles,
rivers and mountains in a most impartial
manner.
About' two o’clock the pawang appeal's
again from his hut, holding a white cock in
his hand. The men gather in a circle and
watch the proceedings with great interest.
After interminable invocations to this spirit
and to that, the pawning at length cuts the
fowl’s throat; then, slitting the bird open, he
lays a stout hook in the body. This done, the
fowl is lightly bound to a board and the
pawang with two men gets into a dug-out
canoe and paddles a little way up-stream, to
w'here some trees are growing out into the
river. Now the end of a long coil of split
cane is tied to the hook in the fowl, in such
a manner that a sudden jerk will pull the
hook crossw r ays, and then the slit is sewn up
with thread. Cord the crocodile would bite
through, but not the frayed ends of the cane.
The other end of the coil the pawang fastens
to another board, so that, wherever the croco-
dile may go after swallow-’ing the bait, his
presence will be made known. If it was a
lake, the pawang would now have thrown all
into the water to float as it would; but as
the river current, though sluggish, would
carry it away, he fastens the marking board
with a piece of thread to the branch of one
of the trees. All is now ready and the
men paddle back to the shore to wait for the
morrow.
Dawn breaks, and the villagers appear by
the bank, but no one seems anxious to bathe.
They watch with interest the pawang and
two men, who get into a heavy dug-out, plac-
ing a gun, a couple of spears and some rope
inside. The gun is for use in case the croco-
dile, if they hook him, be too large to handle.
They paddle off to the trees, and a trium-
phant shout from the two men announces
that the bait has been taken.
The crowd on the bank breaks up in con-
fusion ; men launch the remaining dug-outs
and yell at the top of their voices. Those
who can do so tumble into the canoes and
paddle up and down the river, looking for
the marking board. After a couple of hours’
search ringing yells announce that it is
found a mile down the river, and the pawang
and his two men paddle quickly to the spot.
It is a dangerous job, and if it should prove
to be a loft, or 20ft. crocodile the gun will
have to be used.
The pawang bends over the board, which
is slowly moving away as the crocodile sen-
ses their presence, and hauls in on the line,
the other canoes giving them a wide berth.
Tlie moment he feels a strain, he gives a
strong jerk to fix the hook and the next
moment the dug-out is being pulled down
stream b’’ the crocodile.
Up and down the stream they go, till even
the nine-foot crocodile is completely ex-
hausted by towing about a heavy dug-out
with three men in it, and allows himself
lo be drawn alongside, for the moment ab-
solutely passive. It is just that moment
the old paurnng is waiting for. In a flash
he has taken a couple of turns of cord
around the crocodile’s snout, and the snap-
ping jaw-s are helpless.
The crocodile is roused by the action into
•:i furious demon. But he is held fast to
the side of the dug-out, and the pawang,
leaning over and caring nothing how for
the terrible jaws, contrives to twist the two
front legs behind the back, while one of the
men slips a noose over them and makes them
fast. At that the crocodile gives Over the
fight and is tow r ed in triumph to the village.
There he is dragged up on to the bank,
while the people crowd round and salute
him with every abusive epithet in the Malay
language, before they settle down to torture
and slay him.
Thus is the bathing place made, safe once
more—for the time being.

“Skipper” : A big Adelaide fluffery recently
plastered itself all over with the legend, “Sale
Rendezvous,” which a Frenchman would in-
terpret for you as “dirty meeting-place.”
Moral: Don’t mix your languages.
“Dog Fancier”: Sheep and horses aren’t
the only Australian livestock fancied outside.
Lately dogs have been shipped from Sydney
to Java, where they have gone off like giu
pites. The Dutch in Java show a liking
for poms., and they don’t mind giving a good

“J. Quill”: The chap who brings round
the drinks was talking to a pal about his
son. He’d got him a waiter’s job in a big
city pub, “where ’e’s makin’ 10 an’ 12
poun’ a week.” One night’s takings
amounted to £4 12s. 6d. and a ukelele. “Of
course,” said Dad, “I taugh 'im all I knoo.”
I wondered if he’d consider taking classes;
there are a couple of sons at home the
missus wants to make lawyers.
“Laputa” : When Swift wrote of the philo-
sopher who had devised a project for getting
sunbeams out of cucumbers he was very
pearly a prophet. Years ago in Victoria
an ingenious scheme for making gas out of
vegetables was put forward with so much
plausibility that David Syme put money into
it. It is still there.

‘Mv- Ocky”: My friend Blank, lunching
lightly at a Melbourne establishment, was
horrified to find a grub in his pie. He called
the attention of a waiter to the discovery.
That soft-hearted aristocrat merely re-
marked: “Poor thing, it must have been
cooked alive!” He was probably president
of the Society for the Protection of Worms.
"Phil Ilarum”: I’ve heard of opium and
other contraband being concealed in what
purported to be packets of tea, but the other
day I saw a packet of “tea” opened, and
the contents proved to be sawdust. The
package bore a favorite brand, and there
were no outward signs that it had been tam-
pered with after leaving the packer’s hands.
"D.F.”: Sydney has been eating Mnori-
laml oysters for at least 90 years. The
first recorded shipment was 30 jars of
pickled oysters which came, along with 10
tons of potatoes, 1:30 pigs and two bags of
wheat, in the brig Argo, which reached port
on May 28. .1830. The* Argo was under
charter to ,T. B. Monteflore, and picked up
her cargo at Kawhia and in Cook Strait.

"Joe”: Here is my nomination for primi-
tive ship-building. An old shipwright and
his .son nailed together a 200-ton wind-
jammer at Port Albert, Gippsland (Vic.),
every stick of the timber cut out of the
bush close by. The only help they had was
from a local woodearter, who hauled some
of the logs to the slips. The job took them
a year, and when she was launched 2000
people saw her take the water. She sailed
to Tassy, carrying a crew of local fishermen
who, on their return, after a rough trip,
said: “The acid was put right on her, but
she never murmured.”
“C.L.M.” splashes some cold water about:
Much limelight has lately been thrown on the
Upper Burnett (Q.). Past year various officials
toured the district and were enraptured with it. Yet;
the system is bad that permits a crowd of officials
(mostly theoretical as far as land is concerned) to
boost a locality after having seen it under only
the very best seasonal conditions. Had these same
people inspected parts of the Burnett less than 12
months before, they would have a different tale to
tell. More than 10 years ago a similar tour was
made through some of the newer settlements of the
Central Burnett by Government officials. The place
looked a paradise as a result of the good season, and
on the tourists’ report extraordinary returns were
expected from what was really very ordinary land.
It is on such reports as these that raw immigrants
and comparatively inexperienced farmers are placed
on areas too small to support them in the inevitable
lean years. As a matter of fact, many of 'the
settlers on the Burnett were compelled to leave their
holdings owing to drought and lack of experience.
City immigrants settled under similar conditions in
the Upper Burnett will fare no better. Those cockies
who managed to hang on were able to only because
they secured afeas away from their farms to carry
their surplus stock, and thus give the milkers (their
chief support) a chance on what fodder the small
farm could produce. It is very doubtful whether the
Upper Burnett could be made to carry the number
of settlers the Government intends to put there, even
under a good system of water- and fodder-conserva-
tion. Agriculture, except in a few well-favored dis-
tricts, will, owing to recurrent droughts, always
be subsidiary to stockraising; so that to ensure the
settler—-particularly the learner —against adversity,
each block should be much larger than the regula-
tion 300 acres, even if the greater portion be only
suitable for grazing purposes. It would be advisable,
in view of the money that is to be spent on this
scheme, to get the opinions of practical local farmers
and stockmen as to a suitable living area under all
seasonal conditions, and leave the politicians and
land shark 5 out of it for a change.

“Percy Pawnticket”: A widow appeared
at the Sydney Fpir Itepts Court the other
day, and said she had been in her present
residence for 34 years. At the beginning
she had paid 10s. a week, and now it was
205.: but. the landlord wanted 255., although
he declared that 355. was a fair thing. Tak-
ing 15s. as her average, the lady had paid
£1326 for four rooms and a kitchen, now at
least 34 years old. During her tenancy she
has had six landlords, and it is quite possible
that the sixth is getting a poorer return than
the first or second did, so outrageously has
tlie cost of building and the price of land in
the congested city been pushed up.
“Dipper”: I, too, am “doing" Economics
(diploma course) at Sydney; and this is
how the time-wasting business strikes me:—
I irst Year.—Economics I: A very “general” review
of an extensive subject, interesting, but largely un-
instructive. Business Principles: Henry Braddon’s
admirable “Business Principles and Practice in Aus-
tralia” (enlivened by irruptions of elephantine
humor) read in company with the lecturer (who
doesn’t lecture), so the students might as well study
the work at home. Economic Geography: Of no
value whatever to a commercial student.
Second Year.—English II: A course of 60 lec-
tures, interesting, hut only an encumbrance to the
seeker after commercial knowledge. Commercial
and Industrial Law: A brief examination of Common
Law, some law relating to the sale of goods, and
little or no industrial law. Sadly incomplete.
Accountancy: In 45 lectures from the full number
of 90 in the first year. It treats the subjects very
lightly up to Partnership Accounts. The full Uni-
versity course is two years (ISO lectures), cover-
ing approximately one-third the knowledge required
by any of the accountants’ institutes for admission
to membership.
Third Yeah. —Public Administration: A jejune
examination of the Constitutions and administrations
of other countries for 45 lectures, followed by a
more or less detailed investigation of administra-
tion. The course is designed for, and of interest to,
public servants, only among whom it is popular. Statis-
tics: A bewildering maze of figures, of whose import
90 per cent, of the students are and remain igno-
rant.
The course will cost me £62 (including sta-
tionery, books, etc.), and its value in the
business world is, I'm afraid, practically
nil. To many sadly (and expensively) dis-
illusioned students the thought has often
occurred that investment in a course of
accountancy in one of the leading corres-
pondence schools would yield a far more pro-
fitable return, with less expenditure of time
and energy.
*• * *
“Dido” : The hot-pie man had his stand in
Swanston-street. It was after 11 on Fri-
day night, and the people hastening home
from the theatres were ignoring the pieman’s
eloquent insistence on the fact that these
particular hot pies were superior to any
other pies made by the hand of man. Busi-
ness was rotten, and to add to the vendor’s
troubles his solitary customer began putting
up a clamor about something hard he had
bitten on, which threatened to wreck a new
set of teeth. The bitterness of the outcry
attracted a crowd, and now it was that the
victim held up the cause of his grievance, a
half-sovereign. "Gorstruth !” he said. “ ’art'
a quid. A ’arf a jim in the pie !” “Well,”
retorted the embittered pieman, “a man’s
gutter sell his nies somehow.” There was a
sudden demand for hot pies. The run lasted
lo minutes, and then the stock was ex-
hausted. I might have speculated in the
hot-pie gamble had I not seen the same man
bite on what was probably the same half-
sovereign at a pie stall in Chapel-street only
two nights before.
“10-2-4” on Stall methods: —
[ discovered the other day what L take to be the
chief reason for the present Sydney boom in crime.
It is a matter of the police force being like the
army. I had had stolen from my house an eminently
paw liable article worth about To guineas. I kne«
the thief, knew the day lie had been at the house,
and knew the pawnbrokers and fences whom he
chiefly patronised. So I looked in at the C.I.D. ami
,made them a present of the information. Herein lay
my error.. I had. so to speak, gone to an H.Q.
After a good deal of circumlocution I was passed
into a typical home-service orderly-room, with type-
writers and routine orders about avoiding waste in
the matter of paper all complete, and required to
unload my news over again. I did it a third time
to a very bored policeman whose replica i had often
seen at Lark Hill under the late Billy Mailer. He
mentioned vaguely that my case was “not quite in
their line,” or words to that effect. I inquired if it
would not be possible for him to get on to the people
in whose line it was. The unusualness of the idee
was clearly distasteful. I remember the same expres-
sion clouding poor old Mailer’s face when the pro-
position was put to him that private soldiers tad
certain Common Law rights. I hinted at the wisdom
of speedy action in case the suspect should flee. An
emotion not far short of anguish flitted across his
countenance at the word “hurry.” A week or more
passed. The taker of my property had by now
departed into the unknown, after a hilarious time
on the proceeds. Then I got hold of a young local
policeman and told him the facts that the Brain
of the-Force had already been possessed of for about
10 days. Within 24 hours he had traced the pro-
perty, and 24 hours later had a confession from the
thief. It brings home to me poignantly the truth of
what Philip. Gibbs had to say concerning the intelli-
gence of Staffs.

If the fickle fates would smile,

I with Loot would hunt a while.
Up and down the roaring town,

Finding every man my friend,
Free of hand and big of soul.
Coin to keep and coin to spend—
Narrow ways would widen then ;
Free to batten on my kind,
I should change my views of men.
They that now as selfish knaves
Earn a curse and worse from me,
Generous, kindly folk would seem
Open as the open sea.
I should then, made free of spite,
Free of hate that blinds and clegs,
Know them not as hunting woives,
But as honest, kindly dogs.
Mixing with the gilded clan,
Fat and gross, and lean and small,
I should, doubtless, in good time
Find them human, after all.
Jur-t to shake their honest hands
Through the flame of scorn I’d reach ;
Fine ’twould be to call them friends,
Think their thoughts and speak their speech.
Fine 'twould be with them to hunt,
Rob with them and share the spoil,
Gloating grossly, joud to j0w1....
Yet, I think, I’d rather toil.

the long tramp; it was not only good exer-
cise out aiioiued us an opportunity ot
studying the different human types on the
way. But the two Russian mends who
accompanied us regarded it in a different
light: their shoes were worn and broken—
it is almost impossible to secure a pair of
good shoos in Russia to-uay ; last year only
a million pairs were manufactured for the
130,000,000 people still in Soviet Russia —•
and they were weak from cold and hunger.
Although it was nearly noon there were
not many people on tue streets —mere never
are nowadays in the Russian cities —and the
few we passed were shabbily clad and ema-
ciated. Tliey were like gogols —clean Hearts.
Sometimes we smiled at them, but we smiled
in vain. They did not reciprocate. _ Men
do not smile on the streets m Russia to-
day ; three and a half years of cold, hunger,
disease and disillusion have taken the sun-
shine out of their once efflorescent souls. Uur
friends pointed to one deserted shop and an-
other, and told us that before the revolu-
tion this was famous for laces, that for it 3
leatherwork. To-day they are empty,
neglected shells. The paint is blistering oil,
the glass is dirty or cracked or broken, the
blinds are down, the shutters up v
We stopped in front of the Kremlin. A
few automobiles were standing outside, pro-
bably waiting for some of the _ Red commis-
sars, for only the highest officials ride in
such state to-day. The machines run on
kerosene. The Kremlin is a Tower of Lon-
don, Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s all
in one. It is the Soul of Russia. The
Czars were crowned there; and many of
them lived and died within its moated walls.
To-day it is the nerve-centre of the Soviet
system. Lenin occupies one of the main
buildings, and the flag of Communism waves
where once the cloth of gold of absolutism
challenged the breezes. “Only the Kremlin
is above Moscow, aud only Heaven is above
the Kremlin!” exclaimed Ivan Ivanovich,
one of our friends, as we turned away.
A few blocks further on we passed women
and young girls dragging half-a-dozen small
sleighs of firewood. Unable to get fuel on
account of the famine and the irregular
transportation, they had harnessed them-
selves and tramped out into the forests, col-
lected what wood they could, and were now
hauling it home. For these women Russia
has slipped back a thousand years.
On the outskirts of the factory district
a peasant woman, shawl on head, bast shoes
on feet, bundle under arm, approached us,
looked furtively around to make she
was not watched, subjected us to an X-ray
scrutiny, and then produced a dozen eggs. I
offered her a thousand-rouble note (soviet),
but she shook her head. Paper money is
practically worthless in Russia; a million
roubles are not worth a five-pound note;
and before the war a rouble was worth about
half-a crowrr. Max drew an English half-
sovereign from his pocket and held it out.
Hawk-like she pounced upon it, placed it
between her teeth and bit it, then, appa-
rently satisfied, handed over the eggs and
hurried away. The Government does not
permit this trading: it brands both seller
and buyer as speculators and shoots or im-
prisons them. But in spite of the drastic
punishment there is a lot of this underhand
trade in Moscow. Indeed, peasants now and
then come in and openly market their goods,
hut they take grave risks. We gave the
eggs to the two boys, and they were over-
come with delight; they had been living on
black bread and fish for many weeks.
In the expressive vocabulary of America
there is the word “pep.” It means full of
pepper, of iife. I can best describe this
industrial district of Moscow by labelling
it pepiess. At least half the factories were
closed and deserted, and on all sides smoke-
less chimneys stood like sentinels of Jug-
gernaut. Manufacturing in Soviet Russia
to-day is not 35 per cent, of what it was
before the revolution —a bare one-third.
Six . years of war, revolution and the
a uremia of Communism have bitten into it
like acid. There is a shortage of raw-
materials, of fuel and lubricants, of new
machinery and spare parts, of, skilled labor.
Ivan’s brother was a foreman at one of
the textile factories, so we went straight
to his office, arid from there, under his
guidance, we passed through the different
workshops. At mealtime we entered a large
room filled with workmen who were consum-
ing a dish of some steamina mess —fish stew.
I think it was. Max and I were introduced
as tararislishek (comrades) from Sweden,
and as such we received an enthusiastic
welcome from these Red workmen. They
offered us food, but we told them we had
just dined. Gradually Ivan’s brother
directed the conversation into the channels
which interested us . most —Communism,
Lenin and the dictatorship of the proleta-
riat. These workers were the supreme
pillars upon which Lenin had built his
government. They were the proletariat, the
propertyless workmen, the real Reds, and
it was absorbingly interesting to hear them
discuss and debate the ethics and activities
of their leader. Although they were all
more or less illiterate, they nevertheless pos-
sessed a class-consciousness and revealed an
ethical knowledge of Communism which was
truly remarkable.
At this time Trotsky and Lenin were
wrangling over the militarisation of the trade
unions. The • Jew wanted to discipline the
unions as he had the army; Lenin was oppos-
ing this, and favored loosely-organised unions.
The workmen were following the controversy
with intense interest, and when Ivan’s
brother mentioned that the morning’s
Pkavda (the leading paper in Moscow)
published a statement by Lenin defending
his position, they were all agog to hear it in
detail. After he had read it aloud there
followed a fast and furious discussion.
There were friends of the Government,
enemies of the Government, and neutrals in
that assemblage; or, as Max expressed it,
Reds, Whites and I’inks. Louder grew the
din, some of the workers almost coming to
blows; and when at last the excitement sim-
mered down I opened a fire of questions.
“Aren’t you fellows content under Com-
munism?” I asked. “No!” “Yes!” “Yes!”
“No!” —the answers were flung back from all
over the room. “Well, what about tavarish
Lenin —have you faith in him?” “Ha, da”
(Yes, yes). “And Communism —brotherhood,
equality—is it working out all right?” There
was silence for a moment, and a great, big-
bearded worker —he was evidently a true
communist —shouted out “Ha/” The answer
was the signal for a fusillade— “Niet!”
(No), “Failure!” “No good!”
I was astonished. I knew that the intelli-
gentsia were against Communism, and I
knew that the peasants aud the soldiers at
best were lukewarm; but I thought that the
proletariat—the workers such as these —were
heart and soul in the movement; in fact,
that they were the movement. For three
years I had been reading reports of Lenin’s
dictatorship of the proletariat. He has been
quite frank about his government not being
based on the consent of the governed; he hgs
never claimed to have the support of the
majority; in fact, he has sneered at the idea
of “majority rule,” and lia-s contemptuously
referred to the majority as the “lethargic
mass.” He never tires of reiterating that
the majority are grossly incapable of seizing
and securing their rights. “If you wait for
the majority to move toward their legitimate
rights, you will have to wait until they are
educated, and in Russia that would be over
a hundred years,” he has pounded out again
and again; and so, despairing of the majority,
he pinned his faith on “the class-conscious
minority”—the workmen. He concentrated
ou these workmen, particularly in Petrograd,
which was then the seat of government,
taught them more class-consciousness, satu-
rated them with his communistic ideas, armed
them, organised them into his Red guard,
and then successfully launched his coup
d'etat. Once in power, he announced he
would control Russia’s destinies, and hold the
rights of the people in trust, by force if
necessary, until the people—the majority—
were educated up to knowing what was good
for them. “How can they appreciate Com-
munism,” he asked, “until they understand
what it is?” With this and similar state-
ments lie excused his illegal seizure of power
and rule by force. But in all these state-
ments lie always claimed to have the prole-
tariat—the workmen—on his side.
Judge, therefore, my amazement to hear
these very men upon whom he based his dic-
tatorship of the proletariat condemn his sys-
tem. Certainly all the workmen present
■were not hostile to Communism. As a matter
of fact, the volley of negatives opened up
another volcano of eloquence, out of which
poured a lava of praise and abuse, commen-
dation and condemnation —Heavens, how
these Russian workmen can argue! They
would have continued for hours had the re-
turn-to-work signal not dispersed them.
For the next two hours we wandered
through the mill, subjecting all departments
to scrutiny. The foremen conducted our
tour, and went out of their way to enlighten
us about the conduct and progress of indus-
try under Communism. One told us that
production was not one-third of what it was
before the war. He was, he confessed, dis-
heartened. A big percentage of the cotton
and flax growers, unable to market their
products in the old way, and receiving only
worthless paper money from the Government
in return for their products, were not putting
in flax and cotton, but instead were growing
cereals for their own consumption. The
consequence was a serious shortage of raw-
materials —a shortage which was accentu-
ated by irregular transportation, by the ram-
shackle condition of the plant and machinery
—they were unable on account of blockade
and isolation to secure new machinery or
even spare parts and lubricants—and by
dearth of labor, so many workers had been
killed off in the war and in tiie revolution,
and in counter-revolutions, or had died of
typnus and other diseases, or had returned
to the land where they could at least get
the food and fuel which were both so fear-
fully scarce in the manufacturing cities.
And even those who remained at work, he
assured us, were on the average not 30
per cent, effective, partly on account of
malnutrition, and partly on account of Com-
munism, which by abolishing capital had
robbed the worker of the usual reward for
his services—wages with which he might
buy such things as. seemed good to him.
Now and then we stopped and chatted
with individual workers, aiways leading them
ou to express their views of Lenin and Com-
munism. In all we talked to 20—typical
Russian workers; legitimate members of the
class-conscious proletariat, each and every
one of them. Yet only two declared them-
selves to be in absolute favor of and happy
under Communism; three others were luke-
warm, neither openly for nor against; the
rest were antagonistic. But all were fond
of and championed Lenin—not Lenin the
Communist, but Lenin the Emancipator.
“Why do you have faith in Lenin, and
not in n.s theories?” I asked several.
“Because he gives us a home instead of
a knout, that’s why. But as for Com-
munism—well, we have tried it, and it won’t
work,” answered one of the loomers.
"i>ut wity won t it. work?” I pressed.
“Because, comrade, workers won’t work
without wages, money wages, and peasants
won’t produce unless they can market their
products. That’s why.”
“We believe in Lenm,” said another, “be-
cause he emancipated us. Under the Czat'
we were wage-slaves. We used to work 10
hours a day for 10s. a week.”
“Sixteen hours a clay for 10s. a week !” I
repeated.
jjtx," he reiterated, his eyes blazing, “and
we were treated like animals, not like men.
We were knouted, conscripted, overtaxed, de-
graded. Often we were forced to sleep with
all our clothes on upon the factory floor,
night after night. Lenin emancipated us
from that. Blit if he is overthrown the old
system will return, and then we will go back
to the old conditions. My God!” he ex-
claimed passionately, “we can’t even bear
to think of returning to the old times!”
The other workmen answered our ques-
tions in much the same way. Lenin rescued
them from the old conditions of animal
existence, and now they work only eight
hours a day and have a Saturday half-holi-
day. Therefore, they are grateful toward
him aud regard him as their leader; but his
system forces them to work against their
will, forbids them to strike, and pays them
in kind instead of money, so they are not
content. They want Lenin to stay in
power, for they believe be stands between
them and a return of the dreaded old regime.
But they want him to abandon Communism,
for they are not happy under it, and so great
is their faith in him that they believe he
will do this. “Any man, no matter how
good, is liable to make a mistake in bis
method of government,” they say. “And
then,” they add savagely,-“Russia has been
attacked ou all sides, and he has been forced’
to extremes. But Russia is at peace at
last, and soon the present Government will
be recognised. Then Lenin will gradually
change his system, until we are all happy
and content.” And so they stand behind
the Red leader, while they condemn his
system.
After we had concluded our tour of this
factory one of our friends suggested that we
visit another factory where they repaired
locomotives and see what the workers there
had to say. He had a friend in one of the
repair shops who would bo glad to see us
and show us around.
At this factory we met one of the members
of the Control Board. The workers no
longer run the factories: they tried that
plan and it failed miserably, and now a
committee of three, one a workman, one a
technical expert and one a representative of
the Government, does the managing. As the
technical expert and the Government repre-
sentative always vote together, the workmen
really have no say in management, while
the prohibition of the strike has robbed them
of their most effective weapon.
In this factory, and in still another one
which we afterwards visited, we found prac-
tically the same conditions and sentiments
prevailing. They would not help to over-
throw Lenin because he rescued them from
the old slavery, and because he stood be-
tween them and a return to it; but
they would not work hard for him, and
they were not content, because the ethereal
dreams of brotherhood and equality with
which he had dazzled their imaginations
were not working out as they had hoped.
The words had not become flesh, and they
never would become flesh, and so they
wanted him to change.
One big boilermaker summed it all up.
“We are happier now than we ever were
under the old system.” said he, “for we are
at least treated like human beings. Yet
we are not content. We want money, and
the stores open, and we have not got these
things. So we cannot put our heart into
our work. But we believe Lenin will gradu-
ally give ground until he has us all happy.
It is hard for him to admit that his theories
are impossible; and it is doubly hard for
him to have to force his colleagues to admit
it —-some of them are more dogmatic and
not nearly as big as he is.; But he will
gradually convert them to what is right.
For, never fear, Lenin will do what is right.
He is too big a man to ruin us and Russia
by fanatically sticking to theories which he
must realise are impossible— at present, at
least. He gave us homes instead of knouts,
a 48-hour week in place of a 100-hour week.
The man who could do this has our interests
at heart, and we will stand behind him. But
Communism must go.”
As we walked out through the lines of
shabbily-clad workers, through the defective
machinery, down the road past the scores of
smokeless chimneys, we wondered whether
Lenin would come down from the clouds
before it was too late.
The grey veils of the half-light were fall-
ing as we reached our apartments. I lin-
gered outside for a moment to see the las?
glory of the sunset. A blurred orange ball
was setting in the west over by the Kremlin.
Its last rays seemed to crown the golden
cupolas on the churches, the red and blue
housetops, the dazzling whiteness of the
winter snow. Moscow is still a city of red
and white and blue and gold. But its multi-
colors no longer challenge the breezes. In-
stead, they hang like wet banners.
TOM SREYHILI.
Handicapping the Landscape.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
pioneers of Australia saw chances
of profit in the bush and endured
considerable hardship in the accumu-
lation of sheep and cattle; by accident most
of them remained permanent settlers. For
thio their praise has been loudly sung,
though nobody has greatly lauded the early
shopkeeper who stuck to the dangerous and
uncomfortable town. The pioneers took
a gamble, with chances greatly in their
favor; but. the spirit ih which they did it
was not one for praise. That fact is
written plainly in the language of the bush
they have left us. In every tone of that
language there is hate and contempt--a hate
and contempt which does injury to their
children through every generation.
The whole of the English landscape is
delicately called in tones of love and sym-
pathy. Many of the names are pre-
English, but nearly all are beautiful. Con-
sider the trees of the European forest,
garden and hedge row—ash, elm, oak, willow,
poplar, aspen, chestnut, pine, cypress, linden,
sycamore and cedar. Set beside them the
terms used by the early settlers to designate
the beautiful trees growing in the Australian
wilds —iroiibark. strihgybark, candlebark,
ribbony-gum, sugar-gum, mealy-gum, tallow-
wood, bull-mallee, she-oak, messmate, bundy,
fuzzy-box and bullieh, Every European
•name is a sweetness on the tongue; every
early settler’s name a harshness aud a dis-
cord. They had no feeling for Australian
things these pioneers. At best the names
they gave were memories of something over-
seas, like native i-o.se, Christmas-bush, Christ-
mas-bell and wild rosemary ; but in the main
the flowers were as badly used as the trees.
What sort of perverted soul had the person
who first spoke of a spider-flower or named
one of our most beautiful blooms bottle-
brush? In their older home these people
were accustomed to call even the weeds by
good names. They had deadly-nightshade
and robin-run-tl e-hodge and thistle and
bramble and sweetbriar -all better names
than flannel-flower, lilly-pilly, drumstick,
bladdenvort, bread-and-meat plant and pud-
ding.
And' if the trees and flowers fared badly at
the mouths of these get-rich-quick anti-
Australians, the land in which they grew was
treated no better. For the beautiful words
dell and valley they substituted the hideous
term gully; for grove they said scrub; down,
hill, mountain and peak gave place to names
like hump, uob, whale’s back, razor-back and
even pimple; the very cottage they built they
called in scorn a humpy; a pool or pond was
a waterhole; a stream, brook or rivulet
became a creek (pronounced “crick” to make
it more hateful) ; meadow, lea, glebe and
field were all absorbed into the one word pad-
dock —a term originally meaning a small field
with a path through it, hut specially selected
by the hardy pioneers on account of its ugli-
ness, and further improved by being pro-
nounced “paddick.”
The only use these early pioneers had for
the country was to make money out of it
and get away. They left their children a
legacy of contempt for the land which those
children rapidlv turned to pride and love.
But what a song of hate the first settlers
really sang, what a lingual blight they left
on the whole landscape!

Once again, on Saturday, Sydney Town
Hall echoed with the Melba voice. The
State Orchestra opened the concert with
two Mozart overtures, and then Dame
Nellie came forward and added two more
Mozart numbers: “Porgi Amor” and “Voi
(’he Sapete,” from “Le Nozze di Figaro.”
In these the Voice did everything that the
artist in Melba had trained it to do: it
might have been the voice of twenty telling of
love down the ages. The full glory of the
evening came in the "(Hello” number. In
the “Ave Maria,” following poor Desdemona’s
"Willow Song,” Melba might have been
a child saying its evening prayers; and if
(Hello could have heard the purity and sex-
lessness of that tone, Desdemona might have
lived to a ripe old age instead of being smoth-
ered by a bolster. Then' was a storm of
handclapping and in response “Se Saran
Rose” was wnltz'ed to its final trill. Then
with ii sort of climax came “Home, Sweet
Horae.” The first of the three final brack-
eted songs gave old-friend John Lemmohe
a chance to add the tones of his flute ; not-
able among ♦these three songs was Grieg’s
"Swan.” Then Melba sent her audience
away with the taste of “Cornin’ thro’ the
Rye” on its palate "and why did she do
Hint?” you could hear them asking. Una
Bourne saw that the piano wasn’t quite left
out, and the orchestra knew better than to
give anything less than its best.

Sydney’s Free Church spire, whose rock-
ings dislocated the traffic in Castlereagh-
sfreet for a couple of days last week, is
alleged on the worst authority to have heard
some of Wilkie Bard’s stories at the Tivoli,
just down the road ; the acrobats and melo-
dists and the Folly girls keep up to the
mark, and Nina Gordon’s mimicry has no
limits —she even impersonates herself. “.Tim
the Penman” is on the calico sheet.
Reflections at the N.S.W. Art Society’s
show: —
In spite of his good intentions, the cheers raised
by Minister of Education Mutch at the official
opening of the 42 nd annual Exhibition of the
-V.S.AV. Royal Art Society are not the thing that
is most needed to do Australian art good. The fact
Is Australian art cannot hold its own with that of
the older world unless we rule out the work or the
great and lesser Great Masters, for from them,
whatever their other qualities, we get a vital illusion
of life and convincing light, while from Australian
art generally, and this show particularly, we get
only a succession of poor, pale, more or less false
shadows of tremendous Nature. It does not really
matter much, perhaps, whether the art of this •
country can hold its own with that of anywhere else ;
what certainly does matter is whether the Australian
artist is making an effort to go on from where
the Masters left off, to do his part in the evolution
of painting. He must know his faults before he
can hope to go on, and (he extravagant praise of
a Minister and others, including artists and critics,
and (amongst other things) the flood of local art
books, all contribute to convince the artist that he is
already' there.
Leaving out the few who feel that their mission
lies in the direction of mere story-telling, with
their sentimental “Milestones of Life,” etc., the
average exhibitor in this show takes his art seriously,
and is handicapped only by the narrowness of l.is
outlook.
All artists are absolute realists when they begin;
and because Nature forms the basis of their art
and cannot be done
without, all artists re-
main realists in a
greater or lesser de-
gree, according to the
thickness of the spec-
tacles (called theories)
through which they
see her. Being abso-
lute realists when we
make our first at-
tempts to record the
subject of our choice,
we see not the whole
and the relation of
each part to the whole,
but wc paint a pic-
ture in which our
trees and their leaves
are a series of trees
and leaves all seen and
recorded separately. In
short, instead of re-
serving our lightest
and darkest color for
their respective places
in the whole, both are
liberally exploited in
each separate incident.
The • result is confu-
sion and discord. And
because painting has
advanced and awak-
ened in us an appre-
ciation of tone, and
because we fail' to
fully realise that

and the others got their splendid results from their
wider vision, their ability to See more of the whole
and less of each part separately, we only partly
realise the cause of our own barf-ennesk, We begin
to think that it is necessary at times to £>e false
to get the truth, and we invent theories about Color
Quality, Joy of Paint, Spirit of the Subject and a
hundred and one other things, and embrace them
because the mellowness that follows their adoption
gives a better result than before, in that its
discords and confusion are less obvious, and some-
thing more harmonious is produced. Isut the mel-
lowing methods, while less direct, are still similar
to those employed in the conversion of the hard,
crude, water-color drawing of the disheartened artist,
who threw it out in the rain, and found on dis-
covering it, again that it was transformed. Instead
of being hard and lacking unity, the rain, by caus-
ing the color to run, had reduced its darks and
dimmed its lights; and though in so doing it had
reduced the already limited contrasts to be obtained
in the small range of the palette, and made less
convincing any illusion of light, it had nevertheless
effected something of a. harmony—the kind of
harmony which in 300-odd pictures covers the walls
in this show.
In vain the visitor looks round for the clear illu-
sion of Nature, and, tired of the repetition of it
seen through the thick spectacles of the individual-
ist, he contemplates the effect that, would ..foe pro-
duced if Corot’s “Summer Afternoon” were hung
in the centre of the main wall. Eventually he finds
the nearest things: “The Boat Shed” (No. 298) and
“Flotsam” (No. 36), by G. W. L. Hirst and J. S.
Watkins respectively—two of the few exhibitors who
seem to realise Nature's tremendous range from
light to dark, and who extend to the fullest a
limited palette in an effort to come nearer encom-
passing it.
Miss Beatrix had much to learn concerning men and
things
Which nicely-nurtured spinsters never know;
A lot of giddy innocents insist on having flings—
As. for instance, in the “Lilac Domino.”
So Trixey sought a candle where she singed her
little wings
(In a ragtime way of speaking, that is so),
And, by Gemini' the candle
Has a hotter flame in “Scandal”
Thar, in any play since very long ago.
She paid a risky visit to an artist who was gay ;
She guessed that she was going pretty strong.
His bold and bad advances filled the maiden with
dismay 7
She was certain that she must be doing wrong
When of burning love he told her,
Having bit her on the shoulder;
Said she “It’s fully time I got along.”
But her boiling blood ran colder
When her people came to scold her.
They-were members of the bongiest bong-tong.
They snorted at the artist and they bullied Beatrix,
Small Beatrix, so wilful and so proud:
Herself she extricated from this minor sort of fix
By dropping, oh, a bombshell in the crowd.
Their cruel thrusts she parried
By declaring she was married
To a toff with heaps of capital endowed :
bbe never paused nor tarried
In protesting she was married
To a man whose proffered kiss she’d not allowed.
Then the Bedroom ! Yes, the Bedroom 'neath the
proud maternal rooi,
.Made ready for the “bridegroom” and the “bride” !
The visits oi inspection to that bridal bed (0
stroof!)
W herein she was to lie because she lied.
Oh, the little minx affrighted.
And the audience delighted,
W hen her “hubby” said “Undress and get inside” !
In her meant-for-two apartment Beaty mused upon
the bedding,
And the man she’d got to marry pretty soon ;
They both at once consented to a sudden secret wed-
ding,
That evening, or to-morrow afternoon.
At the falling of the curtain
All the audience was certain
There’d be nothing but a proper honeymoon.
VICTORIA. o. K.
“Scandal,” now tit Melbourne King's, does
not, however, live by Bed alone. It is a
bright farcical comedy, seasoned with melo-
drama which provides good acting opportuni-
ties. Miss Maude Iianatord, as the heroine,
isn t quite It. Her suggestions of nervous-
ness anti fear are in a measure belied by her
personality, yet she is winsome where a
weaker and less attractive artist would be
repellent, and her riding suit in the last act
is calculated to make anv man apologise for
having treated her not more than five times
as well as she treated him. Frank Harvey
plays in this comedy with less monotony of
tone, and with a lighter, happier touch, than
in many a previous part. Something of the
society buccaneer is required of him, and
Harvey swaggers and frowns not too much.
The rest of the highly Competent company
can be described as “supports.” Cyril Mackay,
as the artist, is the most theatrical portrait-
painter this paper ever met: Frances Ross
errs in the direction of excessive swank aiid
pose; Mrs. Brough swanks in pleasing
moderation, and poses not at all. Kenneth
Brampton plays a young man naturally,
whilst II. R. Roberts plays up older man un-
naturally young. Emma Temple presents a
good old sort of duenna, and Doris Duane
shows promise in a walking-young-lady part.
* * * *
“Nightie Night” is now rushed through Mel-
bourne Royal with even more velocity than at
first, and the extra liurrv seems to agree with
it. Also one notices a charm in the tone of
Marjorie Bennett, especially when she calls
upon Billy to kiss her for being no longer
jealous of the vanishing lady in the sleeping
garments. The performance of at least four
of the principals is really better than the
farce deserves, though it has many bright
lines to its credit. At last Saturday’s
matinee Marie La Varre’s pyjamas enclosed
the form of Gwen Burroughs, and, although
the understudy looked rather angular in her
feats of locomotion, she was always active
and intelligent.
The pretty airs of serious opera assumed
by "The Lilac Domino,” more particularly
in the disturbance caused by the tremolo
heroine’s converse with an inebriated Spanish
fiddler whose incursions keep the plot a-
boiling, help to attract Melbourne to Her
Majesty’s. A less human strength of attrac-
tion is in the extravagancies of George Gee
and his fellow frivollers. Nothing wins
quite so much applause as a burlesque ballet,
or something, in which Geo. G. appears in
infantile skirts. It were idle to complain
of the crudity of such diversions. They
breathe the spirit of obsolete extravaganza,
yet seemingly are funny for all time. And
if the five persons concerned in that irrele-
vant scene of revelry were to sport sham
noses and put tfreir hair in curl-paper, the
success of “The Lilac Domino” would be even
more pronounced.
The stage of Melbourne Tivoli was
splashed with tank-water by the mermaid
Annette until Wednesday, and now a new
vaudeville company shares the programme
with a photo-play production of “Twin
Beds.” Edwin Brett and Emmeline Orford
are due in the vaudeville this evening. And
there are others, including Ivy Shilling, who
is an angel host in herself.
The Mermaid Society staged three one-
acters, by Tchekov, Lady Gregory and Frank
Russell, the Australian, at the Melbourne
Playhouse last week. Tchekov’s “The Pro-
posal,” which began the evening, is a mildly
humorous disturbance by one Ivan Varsillie-
vitch, who, whilst begging Stepan Stepano-
vitch for the hand of his daughter, starts
an argument about the ownership of a bit
of land and the relative merits of a couple
oi dogs. The trifle
merely calls for
emphatic language,
and Helton Daniell
(S t e p an o-
v i t c h), D u lie i e
Bland (his daugh-
ter) and Norman
Simpson (Ivan)
did all that was
need ed, though
young Simpson’s
assumption of
manly dignity was
affected by the sus-
picion that he had
borrowed a smaller
man’s trousers.
Fran k Russell’s
"The Jester,” in
which he appeared
with Allie Robson
and Gordon God-
dard, is an uncon-
vincing picture of
the usual triangle,
recalling Bernard
Shaw’s “Candida.”
Certainly Moira
Fenwicke, capitally
played by Miss
Robson, had Can-
dida’s attitude to
l'aul Cottrell, who,
in the hands of
Gordon Goddard,

“Breaking the News” Lady Gregory gets
some broadly-comic effects out of an
Irish village's fondness for gossip. Mrs.
Tarpey (Mrs. Gibson Young), a deaf
stall-holder at the village fair, starts the ball
of scandal rolling to the disadvantage of Bart-
ley Fallon (T. Skewesl, who finds himself in
the end accused of murder and runnin’ away
wid his alleged victim’s wife. Mrs. Appleby, as
Mrs. Fallon, aiyl several others with brojups
that were never born in Ireland, clattered
through the little piece with great success.’
Seven-and-twenty in a row :
Of the artists who are exhibiting in the latest
show at Melbourne Athenaeum, the, most conspicuous
are avowed pupils of Meldrum or acknowledge his
influence in their work. Meldrum himself is repre-
sented by a well-painted view. of Rouen Cathedral,
which has the place of honor in the centre of the
south wall. The best landscapes, clustering round
him and dominating the other walls, bear the signa-
tures of W. Rowell, A. E. Newbury, C. Hampel, R.
McCann, W. Frater and R. Gallagher, who, with the
exception of Hampel, express Meldrum’s attitude
towards Nature with varying degrees of wintry' feeling,
though Hampel' is a follower, too, of the Master, he
has a liking for sunjight demonstrated in “Mallee
Sunshine” by a fine array of exuberant greens. The
tones are lower but refreshingly veracious in the
capital “Morning Sunlight” ; in fact, all through,
Hampel reveals that he thoroughly knows his busi-
ness. W. Rowell, whose landscapes are also appeal-
ing. gets a round of cheers for his portrait of Aunt
Bella, .wherein <a convincing bit of sidelight picks
out the contours of one weatherbeaten hand. New-
bury s portrait of a young lady also earns a vote of
confidence for its simple charm, and Miss Bale’s
portrait of a pince-nezed dame in mauve velvet and
chiffon is distinguished for color and good drawing,
though the effect is a trifle ornate. Mrs, Tweddle is
an ambitious portraitist in pastels and oils, but her
efforts are stiff and amateurish, especially' in the
pastel department. Miss Jo Sweatman’s pastel
sketch of “Peggy” is a much bigger performance,
but her landscapes disarm criticism with their con-
ventional prettiness. George Colville is a sounder
landscape painter who achieves much with an ortho-
dox palette in “The Woolshed” and other sketches.
George Bell has a cheerful waterscape, hut
his best is a portrait of Mrs. Love, presented
against a background like a design for a. subdued
drawing-room carpet. “An Eastern Nymph,” a
bronze reproduction of a rose-bowl centre in marble,
is the cleverest of Web Gilbert’s contributions, whilst
a study, of fruit, glass and earthenware by R. A.
Walker has strong claims for the still-life prize.

Among Adelaide pictures, “The Jueklins,”
at Wondergraph, shows phases of American
life which leaves Australians gasping.
The Pav. has the old Thirteenth Chair:
but it lacks the thrill of the play,
which depended so largely oij what one
heard in the dark. Obviously this is
just what the screen cannot supply. “The
Oath,” at the Majestic, is a version of W. ,1.
Locke’s “Idols,” intense and gripping.
West’s contrasts the new funny-man, Harold
Lloyd, with an Eternal Triangle story from
Jack London. Theatres are largely musical.
Roy Redgrave for several nights replaced
Frank Freeman at the Royal as head bandit
of “The Maid of the Mountains,” and his
long experience of romantic drama made
him a commanding figure in the part. The
bill at the King’s is strong on the singing
side, Palmetto the tenor and contralto Bessie
Slaughter in the lead. The Prince of Wales
is doing well with a mystery melodrama of
a Sealed Door.

“Stargazer”: Can you imagine a play
spoiled by a hat? I have seen it done. Marie
Tempest spoiled “Cousin Kate” by wearing
a most atrocious hat right through the
comedy. It was a blue hat, first cousin to a
painted flower-pot, and became her so badly
that one’s sense of fitness revolted at sight
of it, and the longing that consumed the
poor spectator to light the fire with it

spoiled appreciation
of much of what I
am willing to admit
was very excellent
work. In Act 1
she tjid set it aside
for three minutes,
and then Cousin
Kate looked an ac-
cept a b 1 e little
woman with rather
nice hair; bu t
before we could
look round she had
dived into the de-
testable gear again,
and it was there to

oneself, sayi n g :
“It’s to the dust-
man at last, thank

turned it, and the
thing survived! to
disgrace another performance. The author
makes much of the hat: it is up to Miss
Tempest to get a tile that will be an attrac-
tion. This one gave a sore eye.
“Macquarie Street” on Caruso and Covent
Garden memories:—
The termination of Caruso’s career as a world-
famous tenor occurred on December 12, 1920, and
the last note he sang (flg-hting all the while against
a severe haemorrhage from the throat that was chok-
ing him) was the last B flat at the end of the first
act of “I/Elisir d’ Amore.” He was singing at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, and though his doctor
beckoned to him to leave the stage, Caruso finished
his song before he gave in. He had his medical"
attendant always in the wings, but could never be
brought to understand that a time might come when
he would require a doctor’s services. This is not
uncommon with artists who have reached the front
rank. Their outlook is Olympian, and they are apt
to har e a prot'pund belief in their star. The tragedy
gave rise to a most unaccountable diagnosis on the
part of the physician ; apparently there never entered
his head the idea that the bleeding might be a sign
that the patient was in the grip of pulmonary con-
sumption. At all events, his words to the reporters
were: “But you can see from the diagram what a
simple thing it is, really, and that it will not have
any permanent effect on his voice or his throat.”
Shortly afterwards we learned by cable of the star’s
heroic struggle for life owing to the supervention of
heart failure and pleurisy! I thought at the time
that the diagnosis of pharyngeal hemorrhage from
the penetration of a minute fragment of oyster-shell
was rather far-fetched, because in a fairly large
general practice I had never come across a case of
the kind. We had been taught in every case of
haemorrhage from the throat not to give a definite
opinion until we had made a thorough examination
of the lungs and gone extensively into the patient’s
family history.
After a long illness, Caruso was patched up -suffi-
ently to enable him to satisfy a natural craving for
the climate of sunny Italy as a panacea for all
bodily ills, and he quite expected a restoration to
full health and strength. But complications de-
veloped rapidly, and peritonitis closed the scene.
At Covent Garden, the price of seats was always
doubled on Caruso nights, the first and second rows
in the stalls being one guinea, and the second and
third rows 15s. Orchestra stalls were two guineas,
and balcony, stalls 30s. Both dramatically and
vocally he was at the top of his powers in 1913.
After a season of German opera, beginning on April
21 with “Tannhauser,” Caruso appeared with Georgio
Polacco as conductor. He sang with Melba in “La
Bohcme,” but the strongest combination was Des-
tinn-Caruso-Scotti. Covent Garden habitues are too
well-bred or have been trained so thoroughly that
they rarely applaud during the progress of a song,
but an exception was made when Destinn and Caruso
were together in “Vissi d’ Arte,’’ in the second act.
I can still visualise Caruso on the ramparts of
Castle Sant’ Angelo; and who that heard can ever
forget that weird gavotte in the Palazzo Farhose
scene, and Destinn’s singing of “Vissi d’ Arte”#
“Nella”: Mention is made by “0.K.” of
Howard Vernon doing “Kip Van Winkle’’ at
the old Alec, Melbourne. But by that time
Vernon was past singing the exacting "Kip”
music, and Bob Fitzgerald, a chorister, did
all the more important numbers, while Kip’s
solos were cut. Vernon claimed to be the
first operatic Rip Australia saw, and he
made a hit at the Melbourne Opera House in
the part under the Dunning banner. To my
mind it was easily the best thing he ever did.
“Orb”: Here’s one theatrical record
Howard Vernon put up that I haven’t seen
printed. A couple of years back he and his
touring co. gave, a performance at the Federal
capital. Barring Binghi’s corroborees, it
was the first public entertainment at Can-
berra.
“T. D. Emdee” : Enrico Caruso is another
example of what happens to the bad boy. He
was so bad that his first schoolmaster ex-
pelled him. After that he became a choir
boy and champion tenor of the world, and for
his sins he never saw T Australia. He was
just making good in Italy when Hazon, then
visiting the country to organise a J.C.W.
Italian Opera Co., was advised to go and hear
him. It meant a long train journey, and
Roberto was either too tired or had had too
many gold bricks sold him to undertake the
trip, so Australia got Carlo Dani instead.
“Te Pana” : A transport mishap in May,
1908, was indirectly responsible for making
Howard Vernon a well-known man in the
“smalls” of Maoriland. With his wife and
several others he was aboard a coach that was
being ferried across the flooded Buller River
when the vehicle took a header y>to the
stream. Although dampness was ► worst
personal harm suffered by the party, Vernon
lost all his valuables and “props.” His com-
pensation claim on the Government took 12
months to settle, and during that period he
toured the Ricketty Isles, playing the
“smalls” from Dargaville to the Bluff.
“C. Ockney”: “The Jeffersons,” which
Bert Bailey has put on in Sydney, though
the work of quite an unknown author—-a
youngster named Albert Douglas—has been
running in England ever since it was first
done there, over three years ago. The part
for which Bailey cast himself was originally
played by Wilfred Shine, a brother of the
late well-remembered Harry, and himself here
on a short visit in “Morocco Bound.”
“Hamer”: The “.singing parson,” F. W.
Gorman, blew back into Sydney last week.
He arrived over 80 weeks ago for a 26
weeks’ Tivoli season; but in M.L., where
the people like to mix piety with their song-
and-dance, he stayed 57 weeks. The pull
of the vaudevillain who punches the pulpit
ou Sunday is a new thing in the stage busi-
ness, but apparently it is a real thing.
Bert Bailey speaks off stage :
I appreciate the kind Sundry Shows criticism of
my work in “The Jeffersons,” but I would like to.
refer to one view which is not in exact alignment
with the imperishable truth: “Even a cotton-spinner
devoted to ‘brails’ would hardly wear the same suit
seven years after he had made his pile.” Certainly
not. But a conservative and careful old man would
cling to the old cut of clothes, though he might
accept the tailor’s recommendation to change the
material. There is a difference in the color and the
pattern of the material in the two suits that I wear
at the separate periods. The style, 'or the cut, is
the same.
“Case” : “Hamfat” is wrong in saying (B.
28/7/’2l) that Percy Marmont is an Aus-
tralian. He is an Englishman who appeared
here about five years ago in “Fair and
Warmer” and “The Boomerang.” Then he
w r ent to America, where, after some stage
work, he broke into pictures. Incidentally,
he made his first picture in Sydney—“ The
Monk and the Woman” —with Maud Fane.
“Skyrider”: Back in 1916 the Goulburn
(N.S.W.) Liedertafel Society, at a raptu-
rously patriotic meeting, changed its name to
“Leader Choral Society.” The other night,
at the annual meeting, some of the veterans
proposed to go back to the old name because
of “its splendid associations,’’ and eventu-
ally the whole tremendous matter was re-
ferred to a special meeting. The Goulburn
Diggers are taking a hand now, and the very
foundations of the town are beginning to
shake.
The harvest reaped by Bert Bailey in one
weeK from "uran dad Kudd,” in the darkest
war-days of 11)17, when business was “rot-
ten” : Sept. 23, £l9l 155.; Sept. 24, £lO5
195.; Sept. 25, £214 45.; Sept. 20, £250 45.;
Sept, 27, £273 10s.; Sept. 28, £240 175.;
matinee, £25 os. Od.; total, £l3Ol 9s. Gd. Go
to London for your plays, young man!
“Excelsior”: Did you notice it? Local
theatrical bosses are beginning to hear the
thunder rumble. An inspired par. the other
day spoke of “three big concessions to popu-
lar demand” made by the Tait-Williamson
firm —(1) English plays, (2) fewer mum-
mers with the Yankee twang, and (3)
longer programmes. They’ll be talking of
producing a locally-written drama next —
if the thunder rumbles loud enough that way.
“Norbell”: Away back in ’Bl St. Leon’s
Circus pitched its tent opposite the old Town
Hall in Gray-street, St. Kilda. During the
show one of the front-seat patrons went out
to see a centipede at the Buck’s Head Hotel,
’ and got a pink pass-out check. Something
must have detained him, for it was only the
other day he presented the self-same check
at the tent door at Timaru (M.L.), where
it was duly honored by the fifth generation
of St. Leons.
“0.K.”: Time was, as everybody knows,
when the theatre-orchestra instrumentalist
was abominably underpaid; nowadays it
is better to be a musician than a miner.
But the fiddlers, who were first in the field
of labor to practise direct action, seem
likely to overdo it. In Berlin the other
month an orchestra threatened to leave a
musical comedy to its fate without accom-
paniment unless they received a bonus right
away. This was after the first act. The
leading lady put the facts before the audi-
ence, and asked for their assent to a piano
being substituted for the lightning strikers.
The audience cheered, and the long-haired
conspirators folded up their spectacles and
silently slunk away.
“First Old Man” : It is plain to see that the
J.C.W. firm, though it does not often score
with dramatic works, has a good nose for
the musical-comedy stuff likely to suit Aus-
tralian taste. The Taits seem to find win-
ners in drama easier to pick. “The Little
Whopper,” which faded out in Sydney after
a few performances, was a Tait acquisition :
so also was the show it displaced, “Firefly.”
“Irene” was ahother, and though Sydney
liked it Melbourne cold-shouldered -it.
There doesn’t seem much left after the Wil-
liamson crowd hustles into the comic-opera
market. It makes one wonder how it
ever missed “The Arcadians,” which Clarke
and Meynell produced and made a little for-
tune out of.
“Amateur Musician”: “0.K.” (B.
28/7/-21) is not a musician, or he would
know that an artist has no need “to visualise
the notes aS they last appeared,” etc., before
playing, and that cues would not be of the
slightest use in helping interpretation. A
musical memory is Heaven-sent, and can
never be satisfac-
torily acquired. I
am only an ama-
teur, but have
always possessed
this gift, and if I
tried to visualise
the notes as writ-
ten I should never
be able to memo-
rise at all. As it
is, I play the notes

THE JESTER’S GRAVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Alas, poor Yorrick, here he lies,
Sad as an Arab at his prayers;
No more of laughter in his eyes,
O’erburdened with a dead man’s cares
Dumb as the stricken wife of Lot,
For glee and catch remains’ no breath ;
His quips and quiddities forgot,
He tickles not the ribs of Death.
A thousand - times I’ve laughed for him
As I shall never laugh again;
Since youth was happy in his whim,
Hero’s Sorrow at me like a pain.
Meseems the jesters all are dead,
And he was kilig above them set.
Let now the rue be lightly spread—
’Tis for remembrance and regret.
Yet I would have them carve a grand
Fair Comedy to mark this spot,
The cap and bells within her hand ;
No epitaph would I allot
Of that sad sort that' seems to groan
About us here with jaundiced guile.
I’d cut a jest upon the stone,
That all men passing by should smile.

“I would not Solly be to-day,”

The fierce wind blew my hat away,
Chill winter froze my head.

The unrelenting rain of last week made
tilings easier for bottom weights in the big Hurdle
Race at Caulfield, and three of them finished in the
first four, the winner, ltoisel, being the one most
likely to have fallen in a faster-run race. Taking
7-sec. longer than last year’s record time for the 34
miles (less 92 yards), Roisel made most of the run-
ning, with King Neptune and Fiscom as his most
constant attendants. Fiscom was utterly beaten by
the weight, or by kicking a hurdle, in the last two
furlongs. Neptune also realised the predictions of
critics who mistrusted his alleged stamina, and faded
away, whilst Sandule was making a run and Front
Rank, a rough outsider, was plodding past him.
Sandule didn’t trouble the winner at the finish, but
bis performance in carrying list. 31b. between a pair
or nine-stoners was a real good one. Also it re-
deemed this page from the stigma of an utterly bad
tip, for Sandule was a “two-to-one-for-a-place” chance
at the start.
Iotaus, in winning the Steeplechasers’ Flat rather
handsomely, again showed himself quite as likely to
annex the four-miles jumping event next Saturday as
his old opponent Mountain God. The God may have
improved since the National, as his people maintain,
but Iolaus has certainly improved a lot more. • The
son of Heracles is a trusty jumper, and of all the
old hands at the game he looks the most promising,
on the assumption that the going will be good.
Stable companion Gazomp, or one of the hurdlers
with ’chasing pretensions—notably Haoma—may win
with a stand-up, but tumbles are many in an Austra-
lian Steeple. The chances are against the prize going
to a novice.
Frank Bullock’s riding successes in Eng-
land and France are hardly more than was expected
of him by his Melbourne friends. Bullock’s best
rides were on Melbourne courses before he made his
latest trip to England and got fairly in the, swim.
He rode the winner of the Caulfield Cup in 1918-19,
and his finishes on Lucknow were impressive examples
of the art. On a good horse Bullock is a great
jockey, and nowadays, seemingly, he gets a choice
of good horses in most races where he takes a mount.
A number of Australians in England have, won a
lot of money by following him. .Six wins in succes-
sion, as Bullock scored last month, mean a small
fortune to a punter who plays it up a bit.
Bullock was a discovery of J. E. Brewer’s. Brewer,
who trained for the Clark-Robinson combination,
was himself one of the best Australia has produced.
There was not a point about the game, on the flat
or across country, which was unknown to him. The
struggle between Bullock and Donoghue (who is
described in the cables as English, though he is
Irish on both sides) emphasises the tendency of lads
from overseas to shine in the saddle in England. Tod
Sloan began it 20-odd years ago. The Reiffs (also of
America)- followed; then came the Woottens, with
Carslake and Bullock.
A good old warrior is the Pistol gelding
Epistle, who scored in the July Handicap at Ballarat.
The veteran (he is just 12) has been racing since
he was a two-year-old ; he has started in 198 events
and won 31.
Some of the good horses appeared at
Rosehill on Saturday. The Linacre colt Otacre,
winner of the Mimosa Stakes last Spring at Fleming-
ton, took the Three-Year-Old Handicap in good style,
though on the burly side and carrying 9st. 81b.
Otacre may start in the Derby, but looks more like a
sprinter. White Phast, burdened with list, in the
Parramatta Mile, got his head in front after making
a’ wonderful, run over the last furlong. Old Fortune
Hunter, now in his tenth year, appropriated the
distance race. The third horse, David (a .winner the
week before at Warwick Farm), is going to have lots
of friends for the Metrop. Many good judges count
him one of the best stayers now in training.-
Adelaide Racing Club has had a brisk com-
petition for places on the committee. Bennett, A.
P. Bowman and Loftus MobrhouSe (owner of Fiscom)
were the retiring members, and all sought re-election ;
but “Boxer” Ware, formerly a member of the com-
mittee, had a fancy to come back. All are promi-
nent owners and good sportsmen, and it became just
a contest of popularity. Bennett and Bowman had
no difficulty in retaining their seats, and Ware just
beat Moorhouse for third place.
Describing the recent death of Alacrity
(Pistol —Kathleen), the winner of S.A. Birthday Cup
two years ago in record time for the State, the
Register says piously: “The services of a vet. were
requisitioned. However, the mare was beyond human
aid.” The good city likes to remind itself of the
possibilities of divine intervention even where its
racehorses are concerned.
The Bananalaml Turf Club’s Exhibition
Meeting began at Eagle Farm on Saturday, and the
brilliant Syceonelle beat the Muorilander All Aboard
by three lengths in the w.f.a. National Plate (ljm.).
Another by the defunct Svce, Mabel Syce, fought
and won a duel with the flying Muguet in the Winter
Handicap, and she nearly touched Countess Acrasia’s
.last year’s record for the nine furlongs. Elfacre was
a bit too rough to have a show in the fast-run six
furlongs Ascot Handicap, but Glenbern’s failure was
unaccountable.

The world has altered a lot since Gordon
Coghill, who met Colin Bell at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, first won an amateur championship
(heavyweight) on the same spot. And so has Coghill.
In France, where he rose to captain’s rank in the
infantry, he had his classic features knocked about
by a bomb; and in England, where he fought as
a pro., he was knocked about some more. And all
the time he was getting older and neither more con-
fident nor more agile. Colin Bell was bald and
stout . when Coghill looked a fair and youthful
Adonis, and in the interval he, too, has seen a lot
of trouble. The choice being between a brace of
badly blemished veterans, the odds appeared to be
oil the taller and obviously better-conditioned sol-
dier. However, there is a power of reserve energy
behind the pallid wedges of fat which Bell carries
about with him, and he has a deadly punch in
waiting for a suitable occasion. Coghill early dis-
covered that he could not hit the aldermanic figure
opposite him hard enough to hurt, and before the
second round was through Bell had realised that
he could damage Coghill almost, at will. He put the
finishing touch on the ex-A.I.F. man in the fourth
round- —a left swing flush on the chin. Coghill
seems to have lost all his old speed. Bell, contrari-
wise, is faster in the ring than he was a decade ago.
He is to meet another relic of the past in the per-
son of Petty-officer Curran, at the Hippodrome, in
the near future.
Vic Radford, tile Bendigo lightweight, is
game, but he is as slow as iced treacle and hasn’t the
faintest notion of defence. Pitted against Bert Mc-
Carthy at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night, he
moved heavily about the ring, as open as the day,
until he got a body-hold with the left and whanged
away clumsily with the right. This went on for a
round or two, and then McCarthy found that the ele-
phantine youth from Bendigo had no guard for a
right jolt. The one-sided affair dragged on weari-
somely till the ninth, when the referee said “Enough,
enough! 1 have seen enough.”

Jack and Tom Keeney are the top-notch
boxers in Maoriland, and if you beat one you’ve got
to beat both. Recently Jack Cole (Australia) wiped
out Jack Hejney (M.L. middle-weight champion).
Then he took on brother Tom (heavy-weight cham-
pion), and the family redeemed itself.

“75” (London) : The old “British sports-
manship” looks a bit threadbare nowadays in the
London Standard, Observer, Daily News uRd Daily
Herald. The Standard especially never misses a
chance of attributing English cricket
defeats, dropped catches, etc., to “bad
luck”while an angry article in the
Herald, dealing with the refusal of the
Australians to take part in a county
match on the day before the big Test at
Lord’s, headed its article: “Cricketers
or Loafers?” After the second Test an
equally poor spirit was shown by many
newspapers in the way they attacked
their own men, the implication being
that the Australians had defeated a col-
lection of “duds,” most of whom had
no right to be in first-class cricket. But
you will never convince the Englishman
that he is not the finest “sport” in the
world. It is mildly amusing to observe
the Daily News —one of the papers which
published the terrifying account of “bar-
racking” in Australia —unctuously quot-
ing observations in praise of Hun “sports-
manship” contained in a book “Twenty
Years of Lawn Tennis,”, by A. Wallis
Myers. Says Myers of the Huns: “I
never found them anything but good
sportsmen, particularly abroad. In method
they were more like ourselves at our best than like
the French or the Australians.”
Lancashire made an indifferent display
against the Australian,-; on a wicket which, despite
the rain, was evidently easy. Hallows, the county’s
chief standby with the bat, made 37, but he was
never at his ease. The innings closed for 100, to
which the visitors replied with 317 for five and then
declared. Bardsley made 124 and Parker got Mac-
artney l.b.w for 38. The Lancashire bats, in their
next innings, were as unable - to deal with McDonald
as the.v had been in their first effort, though the free-
and-easy scoring of the Australians had demonstrated
that the pitch was all right.
It was still raining, off and on, when the War-
wickshire match began on Saturday. This once-
powerful county has fallen low since it lost F. R.
Foster. About its - best bat is E. F. Waddy, the
elderly Sydneyite, who is now a master at Rugby
School, and the bowling form is poor. Waddy was
absent on' this occasion, and the only man to stand
up to the Arnrstrong-Gregory combination (McDonald
was taken off after getting one for 27) was Charles-
worth. He made a useful 51 out of a total of 133.
Armstrong, who still heads the bowling averages, took
five for 33—two caught and howled. Collins failed
for Australia (Howell, of Douglas’s Australian team,
bowled him for 15). and then Bardsley and Macart-
ney each ran into the seventies. Armstrong was 50
n.o:, and the score, 312 for seven when stumps were
drawn on Monday. With the breaking of the drought
in England, it does not appear as though there will
be any' finality in the half-a-dozen county matches to
come, or even (short of a fluky debacle on one side
or the other) in the three-day Test ahead. The posi-
tion reduces cricket from a game into an exhibi-
tion ; and the only remedy seems to be fewer matches
on future tours.

McDonald’s 10 for’ 79 v. Lancashire made
his tally 104 (av. 15.34) ; but Gregory’s even hun-
dred lias been obtained at a better average of 14.65.
McDonald is at his best after a spell. He was
rested before the first Test, in which he took 8 for
74 ; also before the second, in which he got 8 for
141. -After another look-on (in Scotland) he took
9 for 51 v. Durham.
* * * »
Andrews’s 88 v. Lancashire made him the
third player in the XI to pass the four-figure mark.
Andrews has scored 1018 runs, averaging 32.83. He
has also had most innings (34). Taylor also im-
oroved his average during the week with 73 v.
Wales and 19 v. Lancashire. He has amassed 905
runs ; av., 31.20.
By scoring 122 v. Wales and 124 v. Lanca-
cashire, Bardsley- went to the head of the list —
1735 runs; av., 61.96. .Macartney’s figures are
1798 —59.93. Bardsley tops the centuries with eight
against Macartney’s six. Both have had 32 innings,
and Macartney has got 28 double figures against
Bardslev’s 21 , the left-hander has four not-outs
against Macartney's two.

For the fifth time in the history of tennis
Australasia has tackled Britain in a Davis Cup tie,
and we now lead by four wins to one. In 1907 Aus-
tralasia won the Cup in England. In 1912 England
won it back in Melbourne, mainly owing to the sur-
prising defeat ot Norman Brookes by J. C. Parke —
a win that shocked the tennis world to its founda-
tions by proving that driving could defeat even the
greatest o i vollevers. In 1914 at Boston in the final
we defeated England, and then did the same to the
United States in the challenge round. In 1920 we
again defeated the British Isles at Sydney. Australia
will meet Denmark next; then there will be a fort-
night’s interval while Japan and India fight their
match, delayed by the fire on the Mauretania on which
the Indian team was to travel. Japan is tipped to
win; but France also was expected to defeat India,
and just failed on the post. The winner of that tie
is due to meet Belgium, and then will come the final,
in which it is possible that Australasia will meet
Japan. It is probable that Japan will come out as
the challenger of the United States.
W. Purcell (Rocldea;) gave the amateurs
a big surprise in winning Queensland 10-mile cross-
country championship at Brisbane on Saturday with
3min. losec. to spare in 64min. 24 2-ssee. V. Col-
lins (Thompson Estate) and G. Watts (Rocklea)
were in the places. It was Purcell’s first champion-
ship. Collins won Queensland five-mile cross-country
championship last year in. 29min. 17sec., and has
taken most of the middle-distance titles in recent
years.
Under' ideal conditions —a nippy westerly
and a dry track —N.S.W. fiye-mile cross-country cham-
pionship was run over Randwiek steeplechase course
on Saturday. For a mile and a half the field of 50
was bunched, with W. Porter (Easts) in the lead.
Then H. L. Sheaves (on the downhill to Kensing-
ton) moved away, and it took nearly a mile of
unselfish pacing to tear him back to the rest. 11.
It. Turner (Botany), M. J. McKenzie • (Souths), 11.
L. Sheaves (Souths) and B. Swinbourne (Souths)
settled down to .a gruelling race as the finish hove

McKenzie gained the ascendancy, the former winning
by syds. with Sheaves 50yds. away third. Turner
did the journey in 28min. 35sec. Last year he fin-

ished fourth for the championship (when H. Hayden
put up the record of 28min. 10 4-ssec.), and he
won the novice .cross-country title in 1919. McKen-
zie was second to Swinbourne in the N.S.W. novice
cross-country championship recently in 29min. ssec.
H. L. Sheaves, the 10-mile champion, was second
last year. For the teams’ championship, Souths (40
points) stopped the victorious run of Botany (48
points), with Easts (105 points) third.
Ou Saturday, in the sixth round of Syd-
ney City Cup . competition, Eastern Suburbs met
Souths at the Cricket? Ground. Easts won by 41,
points (9 tries 7 goals) to 27 points (7 tries
3 goals). South; at the end of the first spasm
were only four points to the bad. And shortly after
the interval, with his nickers delving in magnificently.
Wearing bolted across, and the score stood, Easts 15,
Souths 14. Then Kerwick and Horder put -in some
good work (Souths 19, Easts 15), and Gillespie, snap-
ping up 30y;us. from the Surfers’ line, got there, and
Horder duly raised the bunting. Souths 24, Easts
15. Then came the-downfall. Hume notched a try ,
which was converted by Oxford. Wright got over
next, and he was followed by Easts' champion junior,
L. Steel, Oxford converting. Easts 28, Souths 24.
Wright twice ambled over within the next seven
minutes, and Oxford hoisted his sixth goal. Then
Oxford got his final try and goaled. The Rabbitos’
response was a questionable score by Funnell, and
the game ended. ’Varsity had another clever win,
this time from Newtown, by 12 to 8. Glebe (the
leaders) outed Wests—ll to 8, and Norths did the
same by St. George, 8 to 3. ’Mains had the bye.
Bananaland and N. S. Wales schoolboys
contested the first inter-State match under the League
code at Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday. After
a clever game the home.XIII prevailed In II points
(3 tries 1 goal) to 8 points (2 tries I goal). Scorers
for N.S.W. were Bird, Worsley and Phillips (tries)
and Ruwald (goal) ; for Bananaland McGowan and
Frith (cries), and Cullen (goal).
Melbourne is having a respite from League
premiership matches, the elect of the leading clubs
having gone to Perth to play S. Aus. and Westralia
in the “carnival” series—the first since the outbreak
of war. In the -initial match on Saturday Victoria
(-which means the capital) Jed the Croweaters in
. every quarter, and finished with 11 goals 12 behind?
to S.A.’s 6 goals 7 behind*. A crowd of 15,000
passed through the turnstiles, and (lie offertory
amounted to £1227. Three Test games are to be
played altogether; two points are awarded for a
win and one for a draw. Another Victorian 18
visited Adelaide and downed the Wheat State'*
second-best by 10 goals 12 beliinds to 5 goals 10
behinds. A third team took on the Ma State'-
pick at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and ran over
them in the mud —7.17 to 4.7. A fourth lot visite-1
(and vanquished) Bendigo, and an Association side
scored 18.10 to 2.5 against ,the Westralian gold
fielders, who are used to play ing on brick-hai :
grounds and were all at sea fit’ the Jolimont slush.
It was a great day for Melbourne football.
■fr * * *
The absence of 25 prominent Union Rug
beians in Maoriland did not improve the standard in
Sydney club games on Saturday. Newtowns have still
to win a match this season, yet they made ’Varsity
go all out to beat them. Without Black, their back,
the Students would have crashed. Scott was NewtowF-
best back, and Connor was miles ahead of the other
forwards. Wests made Manly play, but that was all.
The losers’ backs are very feeble. Eyre was Manly -
star. Easts had an even game with Norths. The
Shoremen failed to get the bull out to Sheppard, on
the wing. Cooney' played a dashing game and Oatley,
as usual, was a grafter. Doutrebund and Walker
were conspicuous in Easts’ attacks. Old Bovs had
no earthly against Glebe-Balmain, who got a move
on straightaway. The 0.8. forwards held their
own, but Buchanan and Mayne were too beady. Th<
wing man crossed three times. Pilcher played well
for the losers.
On Wednesday of last week the Spring-
boks had their biggest win of the M.L. tour (34 —3)
against South Canterbury. On Saturday, Southland
(holders of the Ranfurlv Shield) were downed at
Invercargill by 12 io nil. The Hying Van Heerdca
and Morkel got two- tries each, but the heavy ground
and greasy ball kept the goal-kickers out of the
limelight.

In Sydney Soccer on Saturday, Granville,
who had only to win to take the first-grade premier-
ship, went down before Eastern Suburbs by two to
one. Easts have never played better this year;
Granville have seldom played worse. Pyrmont havr
trow' only to defeat Gladesville (postponed match) to
take the premiership.
A N. S. Wales Soccer XI defeated Queens
land at Brisbane on Saturday by four to one. A fast
first half ended one all ; but, after refreshment.
N.S.W. ran over the Northerners. Maitland and
Sinclair shot two goals each for the winners.

Football form in Adelaide, previously very
mixed, is sorting itself out a little. When the club
fixture-list broke off, to let a' State team go to
Perth, Ports had a clear lead with 20 points—lb
games won and two lost; Souths second, with 16;
Sturt, West Torrens and Norwood next; North and
West Adelaide and Glenelg out of it. Tom Leah;
is the State’s captain for the Westralian visit.
Sculler Oliver Searle, of the • Clarenc
(N.S.W.) and nephew of Harry, licked Tom Price by
nine lengths over three miles at Woodburn on Satur
day iu 22min. 27sec. There was a strong tide
against the men. Stake-money amounted to £2OO
and the winner w r as backed down to 5 to 4 on.

Adelaide City Council is squeezing the
Cricket Aseoc. a bit harder over the new lease of
the Oval. The present rent is £lOO, but after the
25-year-lease runs out in 1923 the claim will be, in
seven-year periods, £2OO, £3OO and £4OO. Then
is also to he a provision that all profits must be put
into permanent improvements, which would block an
occasional bit of generosity to such as. for example,
the Victor Trumper Fund.
A. G. Hill did three-quarters of a mile in
3min. 5 4-ssec; at Salford Harriers (Eng.) meeting re-
cently. The previous bests were W. Richard’s 3min.

The only better figures on the world’s record-book
are T. P. Conneff's 3min. 2 4-ssec., put up in
U. in 1895. t
Positano, just dead in his 28th year, was
a stallion who promised great things in bis voungrr
days. The imported son of St. Simon and Ponza, hr
ran about half-a-dozen races-in Australia as a four
and five-year-old, and won twice. The win that
deceived all the shrew'd heads of his time was scored
at an A.J.O. Spring meeting, when lie took a w.f.a.
race on the Derby Day. This form gave him a real
dead-bird appearance for the Metropolitan on the
Monday. There never was a better thing on paper.
It caught the eye of every old sport who, having suf-
fered from the glorious uncertainty of the turf, was
hardened against all temptation save the very strong-
est. Positano was one of the strongest. His weight
for the Met. was something under Bst., his breeding
was extra first-class, lie had beaten a good w.f.a.
field brilliantly. Telegrams poured into (he betting
clubs in Sydney and Melbourne —wires from client-
who hadn’t risked “50” on a questionable moral fur
five years. But Positano proved no good in tin
Metropolitan, and when the Melbourne Cup canio
the handsome nag was no good again. Then it be-
came evident that Positano could not be trusted t' l
do his best except at the stud. In his second year
of matrimony he begat Lord Cardigan, winner m
one Melbourne Cup, and runner-up the following year
with 9st. 61b. Two years later Poseidon confirmee
his father’s claim to be a champion at the stud
After which the old man sired two more Cup winner-
—-Lord Nolan, a mere ponv. and Piastre, as late a-

“O.Iv.” : Among early public fancies
for the Melbourne Cup is Syce Knight. Having com-
mitted the indiscretion of a Syce Knight tip in verse
for last year’s Melbourne Cup, I wish to remark that
1 did it on information that the Queensland hoc-
looked like a stayer. When I saw him before the
V. Derby' I gave up the tip for lost. S.vce Knight
struck me as being a showy', leggy colt with all
his good looks on top. A year’s filling out may
have made a considerable difference in his figure
but I cannot picture him as a two-miler in the very
best handicap company', even with the easy weigh’
of Bst. 21b. Much less could I fancy leggy Nautical
(Bst. 111 b.), who beat Syce Knight in their \ .R- 1 •
Derby places. Although he did win a Leger iron.
Salitros, when the latter was short of work, his subse-
quent, form doesn’t make him a good chance at
Sst. 111 b.

Postal Course of Health

into play the neglected muscles, steady the nerves, help you
to breathe and develop properly, ami make all the organs
of the body perform their functions correctly.
No apparatus is required, and each lesson is graded to
suit particular individual requirements.
“Snowy” Baker has written a most interesting booklet,
"Health and Strength from Self-Culture,” which tells all
about the course and contains many valuable hints. If you

Heart of
Melbourne.
The Navy Ofliee says it knows nothing
of the proposed appointment of Rear-Admiral
Great ore x to he First Naval member of the
Australian Navy Board. Neither can Navy-
Minister Laird Smith-give any enlightenment.
Greatorex at present dies his flag on H.M.S.
Monarch. Those who know the Priminister
say he wanted to “run the rule” over the
prospective new member in London before
any appointment was made. Toe Cook is
mum; but an early announcement may be
expected.
Leaving Irvine in charge as Lieut.-Gov. —
now that the Assembly has been dissolved
and writs for the election of new members
signed—-the Earl and Countess have tripped
over to Sydney to see Governor Davidson
and Dame Margaret, and incidentally hear
Melba sing. When the vice-regal pair have
had a peep at the harbor and the places
with more elbow-room beyond, they will go
on to Brisbane to visit the Nathans at Gov-
ernment House. Irvine will be Deputy for
a month or so, and may open the session of
the new Parliament about September 6.
The State Governor has hurried Lady
Stradbroke to the Queensland sunshine after
her recent fever attack. The invalid is the
thinnest countess imaginable, and certainly
needs plumping up.
The Governor i.s beginning to be suspected
of a liking for “literary” drama. He dropped
into a pen at the first night of the Mermaid
show last week, though the evening was wet
and bleak enough to make a Polar bear
long for a warmer climate. There were
probably about a hundred in the audience,
but the great vacancies below him and the
absence of “God Save” when he entered
never - blighted the smile that stayed on his
face all night. The cheerful programme
touched the Earl’s funny-bone, arid when the
Countess joined the party, after paying a
duty call elsewhere, the vice-regal box made
itself heard. Lady Stradbroke isn’t afraid
of losing her dignity by laughing like a human
being.
Dr. Rupert Downes has been made Military
Medical Director for Victoria. Dr. Rupert •
was flying his brass-plate from a modest
little South Yarra suburban cot when the
war started. Then he blossomed into a
lieut.-colonel in Egypt, and at the finish blew
back with a C.M.G., to the joy of bis old
dad, General Downes, once State Comman-
dant for Victoria and S. Australia, and
afterwards sec. to the Vic. Minister of De-
fence. His wife, who did some Red Cross-
ing with the Soldiers’ - Wives (presided over
by Lady Helen), got an 0.8. E.
Xavier College paid its tribute to T. J.
Ryan. When a 14-year-old lad he entered
on a scholarship, and study-time to him was
a period of earnest endeavor, as it was a
struggle to keep at school even when tuition
was free. When news of his death arrived
the students were assembled in the big hall,
and Rector Sullivan, S.J., himself an Aus-
tralian, wove a wreath to the memory of
the brilliant old boy.
At Flinders-street the other day a Digger
with more than a slight list to port was
arguing the right-of-way with a dutiful
ticket-collector who demanded an unprodu-
cible ticket. The language got thicker and
thicker until at last a constable took a hand,
much to the Digger’s disgust. At this stage
a quiet citizen, purchasing his own ticket
close by, turned round, spoke to the police-
man, fixed the matter of the missing paste-
board, helped the Digger on with his hat, arid
then passed to his train. “Oo’s that
bloke?” asked a bystander, as the broad
back of the quiet citizen disappeared. “Don’t
you know?” said his 'companion. “That’s
Monash.”
An empty box on the right of the circle
was the wonder of the crowded house at the
King’s last Saturday. The opposite pen
held the John Tait party, and a good many
hardened first-nighters came to give “Scan-
dal” a chance to shock them. The verdict
of a mixed multitude was: “Rather over the
fence, but very interesting,” supplemented
in one case by a growl : “I was told he
tlireic her on the bed.” The general remark
of the more moral motoring circles was that
there had been little to blush about and
plenty to laugh at. After all, there is a les-
son in “Scandal” for nice girleens bitten
with the craze for “going it.” The lesson
conies from Beatrix’s distorted notions of
social sportsmanship, formed from a femi-
nine point of view. The man is expected to
be just as hare-brained as his powdered pal,
though every bit as honorable. as the late
Brutus. Bertie’s constant problem since
cocktails and tags came into vogue for flap-
pers is how to play the sport without wish-
ing to Heaven he hadn't to.
Queen’s Hall Hew a '’house-full” sign on
Friday night, when the monthly gathering of
Slntkspearean devotees happened. The de-
votees seem to be mostly feminine, and
,mostly elderly. A few provided an aggravat-
ing accompaniment to the programme with
clicking knitting-needles. The Seawtch-Eng-
lish Professor Bob Wallace, who acted as
M.C., broke the sad news that, the players
in the Sliakspearean turn being down with
the ’flu, the event had to be scratched.
Charles Daley spoke a long piece about Eliza-
bethan London and sea expansion, and Mrs.
Frances Fraser told the assembled multitude
all about young life in the Immortal Bill’s
day. Between whiles Norman McLeod lifted
his voice in song.
Miss Laseelles gave a pupils’ ball at the
St. Kilda Town Hall the other night, and
raked in a good cheque for the Blind Appeal.
Last year .she gave a similar shivoo, whereby
the Queen Victoria benefited considerably.
Mrs. Harry Emmerton had Raveloe all
fussed up last week to receive Annette Kel-
lerinan. Daughter Mrs. Norman Brookes
used to play mermaids with Annette in the
bay in their early days ; also she was a pupil
of Mrs. Ivellerman. Mrs. Fan Dango Mackay
came out of her shell and sang some sweet
songs, and Kirby was in tremendous voice.
A cheque for £540 6s. Bd. for the Blind
Appeal was the legal-looking but healthy out-
come of the dinner-dance at the Occidental.
Miss Monk gave the dinner, with no deduc-
tions for exes. It was a fine result for one
evening’s work.
Cliveden got very flurried on Friday. Mrs.
Barry Thompson had rushed up a big card-
party for the. Alfred Hospital Appeal, but
the wretched man-with-the-chairs didn’t
arrive till an hour after schedule time. The
poker-players were furious, and their toque
feathers ruffled up like the plumage of the
fretful porcupine. But they set to with a
will when the necessary furniture arrived,
and Mrs. Barry bagged a good £lOO for the
cause. There was tea with the usual raffles
to help. Clifton lloanas, who flats at Clive-
den, arranged a music programme, among
the artists being a precocious eight-year-old
daughter of J. 11. Macdougall, who played
Beethoven. Walter Kirby won an extra
fiver for the hospital for one song.
Mrs. Gleneross threatens to show what
housewives can do at a monster exhibition
to be "held in November in the Exhibition
Building, Specimens of all sorts of things
a woman can produce will be on view, and
Mrs. Gleneross will be there to say “There
you are, you see,” to every man that passes
by. The prize exhibit, one supposes, will be
a fine healthy family.
Jack O’Hagan, pictured herewith by Sears,
began to write songs in his teens. Instead
of developing long
hair and an artistic
melancholy, the
youngster set out
briskly to show that
Australian songs had
good commercial pos-
sibilities, and he
seetns to have proved
his point. “Blue
Mount a'i n s,” his
latest effort, is the
kind of song that
exclusive orchestras
compliment by adapt-
ing to a yearning
Hesitation wal t z.
O’Hagan was a St.
Patrick’s College and
Xavier boy who
tried for the A.I.F.
but was rejected, and then bogged into
home-service work. He has collaborated at
times with Henri Penn, Cliff Hansen and
Fedora St. Leger, and since his hit with
“Blue Mountains” he has signed a contract
for half-a-dozen other numbers to be pub-
lished in the near future. He was recently
given -the job of professional manager at
Allan’s.
The ball and pageant at the Town Hall
on Thursday for the pupils of the Sisters
of Charity schools in Melbourne was an im-
pressive event, and is to be made an annual
affair. The Countess came,, and took Ladv
Helena Rous’s place in the official set, which
was a delightfully youthful frolic —Sylvia
of the Henness.vs, Madge Wren, Dorothy
Pohlman, Monica Burke, Rosa McFarlane,
Justice Cussen’s daughter Alice and the
Murray Mortons’ chick Maie made up the
pretty crew. The Countess wore black velvet-
and-fur. The Hennessys were there, the lady
in white brocade. Lesley Madden had a
classic wreath in her hair and some ivory
white togs. Mrs. Vogrich looked like Queen
Bess with a 12in. ruff of yellow old lace.
Dr. Maloney brought a smile and a daughter.
Frank Brennan came with his lady, who
was in paddy green and white. The J. B.
O’Haras and Dr. Spring and Mrs. Jack
Spring were also present, and Dr. Parer and
his young wife, who was sheathed in exquisite
black satin. Dr. Lane and his handsome
lady watched their girl lead the pageant.
She is a 14-year-old amazonian beauty.
Florrie Green, who had rehearsed the para-
ders, wore a dress of silver tissue, pink silk
and lace, and she flanked the procession of
the youngsters in the maze-like turnings of
the march, which was one of the most grace-
ful things Melbourne has seen. The pupils
dwindled down to three-year-old tots who,
after the parade, were packed off home to
bed. .The small fry. who had quadrilles and
minuets in the early evening, were dressed
in 17th-century clothes and powdered wigs.
The C.L.C. students of honor were presented
in white dresses with cardinal gown and
trencher, and after supper in the Council-
room the hall floor was given over to general
jazzing.
Vida Lahey, a Bananaland artist who was
an old Melbourne Gallery girl, recently re-
turned to Australia
after many years
abro a d, bringing
with her the pick
of her work in
France, Belgium,
Holland, Italy and
Britain. She has
already had an ex-
hibition in Brisbane
(the Gallery there
has bought a canvas
or two), and is wait-
ing for “space” to
show ill Melbourne,
which is rather over-
rushed with dates at
its various galleries
just no w. Th e
young artist studied
in Paris, then
downed brushes to plunge into war-work in
England, where she toiled at the Anzac Club.
After “Cease fire” sounded she spent a strenu-
ous painting year on the Continent, and de-
veloped a power in her work that has created
quite a stir in her home country.
Wilfrid Cotton, the manager of the Marie
Tempest season, was given a farewell supper
before he moved on. Menzies’ produced
waiters and covers for 24 guests, and the
party happened at a Hepburn House flat in
Collins-street, where the Cameron florist
girls did the table proud with red roses and
little French posies. Stars from all the
theatres came along after their shows. It
happened to be the day Caruso died, and
Walter Kirby caused a sensation by singing
in an inspired way an aria from, Chenier’s;
opera “Giordano,” which was written for
Caruso, under whom Kirby studied it. When
the last note had been sung and the com-
pany had got its breath again, Wilfrid Cot-
ton jumped up and offered £2O to any charity
Walter Kirby cared to name, to be handed
over as a Kirby donation ; and another guest
added a similar amount. Incidentally, Daisy
Willoughby, a Melbourne girl, got a pat
on the back for her clever accompaniment.
Before the party slipped back into its merry
swing a silent toast was drunk to the Voice
that is still.
Melbourne Grammar prefects, headed by
school-captain L. Bakewell, have sent out
cards for . a two-stepping frivol at the St.
Kilda Town Hall on Sept. 19—“ dancing from
8.30 till 2 a.m.” Misguided parents may allow
their young folk to give their own parties
and dance like their elders until the sma’
hours, but eyebrows are raised at the idea
of headmasters allowing boys to do these
things under the school colors. It robs head-
masters of their terrors.
Mrs. Charlie Perry, better known as
Dorothy Frances McCrae, arrived from
Maoriland last week on a visit to her mother,
Mrs. G. Gordon McCrae, ofMlawthorn. Her
husband, the Rev. Charlie, is vicar of St.
Michael’s, in Christchurch. For 60 years
peace reigned within its portals, but after
the importation of an ultra-high vicar the
dove took to itself wings. After his return
to England the vacancy was offered to
Dorothy’s husband ; but the dove hasn’t come
back to the cote.
James Niall has signalled across seas that
daughter Maggie and her English husband,
Captain Leroy Burnarn, may return to Mel-
bourne with him.
The younger generation don’t waste time
in their love affairs these days. Alan Cob-
ham, of this hamlet, knew C. R. Walsh’s
daughter only three weeks before he asked
her an important question. A satisfactory
reply having been given, they are to be
married in St. Andrew’s (Sydney) this
month. When the Wedding March has been
played they’re off to live in Ceylon.
When sent for by the Earl, Prendergast
borrowed a State car to take him out to Mal-
vern. Possibly he thought on the way
that he would have the ordering of the State
motor-fleet in future; but he was only to be
asked if he c6uld show why Lawson’s appli-
cation for a dissolution should uot be granted
Why his Ex. should have made both I'm,
dergast and Allan drive but four miles wh*]>
a comfortable vice-regal chamber is provide:!
at the Chief Seo.’s building in 'Spring-street
is difficult to understand. Of course, Lawson
had to do the journey also. When Watt wn-
Premier he gave the then Governor a broad
hiut that the official office was the proper
place for important State business: but b
didn’t post his advice on the wall of the
Gov.’s office.
Dr. Don Bennett, who goes to a job in
the Apple Island, was given a farewell feast
at the Occidental on Friday evening. ID
was a majah at the wah, and his blue-and
black batt. colors were among the decora-
tions. Eight Digger pals gave the dinner,
and General Blarney was the biggest brass
hat in the company.
Mrs. Pursey Chirnside and daughter Mollie
are due back in Australia in October. Tic
lady seems to use the equator as a skipping-
rope, so often has it passed beneath her feet.
What with post-war taxation and social un-
rest, England is not the paradise for socially-
ambitious Australians that it used to be.
As it leaves Adelaide at present:—
Charity .and the newly-acquired fancy for jazz late
in life are responsible for the tact that pater and
jnater, who a few years ago would have quoted bridge
as their hobby, now haunt the Palais pretty well
every night. We are averaging about three func
tions a week in aid of local charities. The Children’s
Home (Walkerville) and St. .Mary’s Mission of Hope,
are the latest to get a good haul from a Palais night
The Christian Young Women are on the war-path
again. This time it is a “Guinea Campaign.” To
inaugurate the drive a banquet was given in the
Lady Colton Hall, when 12 good ladies made speeches,
and eight toasts were drunk in gassy water. One
mysterious toast was “Our Outskirts,” which sounds
like some sort of top-dressing.
The scheme for raising funds for the Children's
Hospital i,s on a big scale. It starts off with a
Carnival of Flowers at the Palais on September 2,
and a whole week of variegated and high-pressure
money-extraction follows. The Mayoress and a big
committee of women are busy as bees on the job.
In all £20;000 is wanted, and if we can raise
£5OOO the Government has promised to give another
£5OOO.
The students of Mrs. Delrirar Hall and Winsloe Hall
concerted in the Queen’s Hall the other night to
raise funds in response to Lady Weigall’s appeal for
the Consumptive Home. Her Ex. has certainly
roused the public to a practical interest in some of
the old and neglected institutions.
In spite of rain and squalls, there was a huge
rally at the Exhibition Building wMn. an impressive
ceremony was held to the memory of sailors and
soldiers who died in the war. Seventeen patriotic
organisations combined to work it up and the vice-
regal and Mayoral parties, “Cheer-Up” William Sow-
den and members of the Ministry were prominent
in the gathering. Later floral tributes were placed
on graves in the A.I.F. Cemetery..
A few days ago the Adelaide Hounds held their
meet at Strathalbyn, a country run that dates back
to 1877, when William Gilbert provided a deer, and
Lancelot Stirling was Master. It is the third gener-
ation who are in scarlet now.
His Ex. recently visited the military headquarters
at Keswick and handed out a number of medals and
decorations. Lieut. J. H. Hill and Sergeant A.
Errington received each an American award, the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross. One of our old military
.birds, by the way, dons a huge cross on a red neck-
tie upon State occasions. It is said to he a Russian
order, and someone declares it gives him free access
to foreign convents!
Frank Freeman, the gentlemanly brigand of “The
Maid of the Mountains,” is slowly recovering from
the ’flu at Government House. The eight principals
were invited round there after the show on Monday
night for an impromptu dance, and Freeman became
so ill during the evening that his Ex. urged him to
remain, and be attended by the vice-regal M.I).
The kick-off was given by his Ex. to the new
School of Arts, University College, established by
Edith Napier Birks, where all sorts of craft work
will he taught, in addition to drawing and painting.
Society was in full force, and Edith and her mother
entertained the gathering at afternoon-tea in one of
the large studios.
That heroic worker among the abos., Mrs. Daisy
Bates, who some time ago went to Perth for treat-
ment for an affection of the eyes which had caused
total blindness, has now recovered her sight, and has
returned to her beloved Binghies at Ooldea, on the
south-west coast.
“Kelby”: The Med. Society at Sydney
’Varsity gave Professor “Johnny” Hunter
a farewell spread last week; but the stu-
dents’ real farewell took place at his last
lecture, when they presented him with a
trunk about the size of a wardrobe. Four
hundred students rose and cheered as one
when he stood to return thanks. Consider-
ing the Professor is not yet 24, his hold over
his students has been remarkable. Hunter,
who has been given a year’s leave, sails for
the Cold Country this week to do special
research work on the brain with Elliot Smith,
another brilliant Sydney graduate, and with
Prof. Wilson, his old teacher, who was mainly
responsible for the Senate breaking all the
rules of convention and giving Hunter his
professorship.

of taste, and we think the No. 1 Grade
will appeal to you if you give it a trial:
it has a delightful aroma, a delicious
flavour, it turns a lovely goldy creamy
color with milk and it is very saving
tea to use.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeproof
Hosiery
Sydney's best fur-coats cuddled down into
the hard Town Ilall chairs for Melba’s
home-coming concert. For 20 minutes before
the hour George-street had been a purr of
limousines, and mere foot-arrivals were forc-
ing their way at deadly peril up the little
bits of space at the side of the steps that the
cars didn't usurp. The vestibule was a surging
mass of heads waved and bald—the waved
and the bald invariably in company. Tweed-
coated girls and boys and old men and
women took up the back seats; and the organ
loft was simply a blot of humans. There
was one moment after the arrival of the
orchestra when the betting was even that
Dame Nellie could only find footing on top
ot the piano. Between five and 10 minutes
past eight Verbrugghen got fussy, and started
on the National Anthem ; then, just as the
audience was seated, the vice-regals swept
in, and everybody had to stand all over again.
The breathless moment arrived when
Melba, in a simply-cut pink panne frock with
a quart or two of diamonds spilled over her,
liara downwards, swept on to take the
plaudits of the crowd. The voice is still
the Voice, liquid, young, exquisite; it is a
lark's song preserved in ice. The orchestra
supplied soul-satisfying accompaniments.
Finally, when the stage was so stocked with
Mowers that it resembled a well-conducted
funeral, and after a dozen or so returns to
acknowledge the applause, the Dame sat
down at the piano and sang (now, don’t all
guess at once!) “Home, Sweet Home.”
Dame Margaret was ermine-wrapped, and
Diana and Daphne were there, and in the
back rows surely the oldest lady in Sydney.
Mrs. Sep Levy in gorgeous furs and a beauty
patch was a front-sea ter; and Mrs. Arthur
Allen, looking like John Longstaff’s portrait
of her, wore her white hair smoothly dressed.
The Melba daughter-in-law, Mrs! George
Armstrong, all in white, looked like a snow-
maiden. Mrs. Box (Melba’s sister) and
Mrs. Watson Holdship sat together; and
Mrs. Bertie Kelly’s headdress and silver
waterfall coat challenged all eyes that weren’t
fascinated by the bronze legs of the obvious
swimming girl that shone in dark patches
through white mosquito-net stockings.
Play-acting was in the air last Thurs-
day night, when up at the Conservatorium
the little Belgian colony produced Maeter-
linck’s “Mayor of Stillmonde” (would Dul-
wich be too free a translation?) in the
cause of their distressed countrymen. Consul
Segaert led the cast as the indomitable
alderman who would not allow his gardener
(Francis de Bourguignon) to be shot by the
German invader because a German soldier
had been inconsiderate enough to be vitally
punctured in the mayoral kitchen-garden.
The tense moment arrives when his Worship
throws off his clinging daughter Bella
(French-mistress Irwin of the Girls’ High)
and dashes out beyond the drawing-room
window to become the sacrifice to German
ruthlessness. The dapper little Consul and
Miss Irwin were quite Bernhardtian and
David Garriekish in this scene; and Neville
Mayman (with a figure) was the abominable
Hun who hissed his French like a bath-heater
gone wrong. In the intervals there was
music, pianist de Bourguignon getting down
to such nice, intimate terms with his instru-
ment that there was not the fear so prevalent
at musmal recitals of late that the piano
would have to be dry-docked before morning
for a hernia operation. The Walter David-
sons sat in the row of sea-grass chairs which
unfortunately had to be placed ’midsh’ps,
right in the icy draught, to the obvious dis-
comfort of the divine Nellie Melba, in spite
of hey two fur coats. (Ermine underneath
and a souirrel enveloper on top—the sight
turned every woman into a kleptomaniac.)
The Belgian Benevolent Society collects the
gate money.
Grace Stafford, who went to Oxford to get
permission from Gilbert Murray to use hi,s
translation of “The Trojan Women,” pro-
duced her bit of Euripides at the King’s Hall
for the second time last week. Grace her-
self, looking far too graceful and attractive
for the part of the supposed withered and
w r astecj Hecuba, but managing to convey by
her beautifully-cadenced voice the sense of
torn-asunder heartstrings, wore the flowing
grey robes of grief, while naughty Helen of
Troy flaunted a robe of cerulean blue and
looked as though she had‘eaten her cake and
gloried in it. The Chorus,- in purple gar-
ments and a lily-white array of bare legs,
intoned the flowing lines, meantime curving
themselves into the approved facsimiles of
urns and friezes and bits nf pottery. Grace,
who studied in London with Sybil Thorn-
dyke and others, learned all their tricks of
the Greek trade, and adds a few out of her
own bright imagination.
Out of the craze for the Greek play has
arisen what is possibly the worst pun on
record. “Do you know Euripides?” the Uni.
cub will demand from you, and before you
can reply he dashes on, “Do you know
Euripidecent pair of pants if you sit on an
upturned nail?” When Helen of Troy faints,
the cub only mutters that the Highbrows
have brought it on themselves.
Premier John Storey’s wife isn’t going to
be allowed to drop any of the condition she
gained on her travels. Since her return her
afternoons have been a round of cake-tasting.
The female part uf the A.L.P. brewed her
a dish at the Marlborough, and, although
the invitation cards said the reception was
from 3 till 5, a genteel arrival at 3.30
found nobody on the mat. All the hostesses
and the guest of honor were already at
the feast. Of course, the Ministers’ wives
also killed the fatted calf for their Premier’s
lady; they met in the large dining-room at
Parliament House, which had been turned
into a wattle-bower for the occasion.
That conglomerate which names itself the
Institute of Journalists ate its annual dinner
off a board arranged as a horseshoe in the
Macquarie—-a new tea-room which has taken
the place of Mrs. McCracken’s Textile Col-
lege. The main feature of the evening’s
business was the election of Dr. Ward, now
retired from active labors and living in Syd-
ney, as vice-president, and the ousting of
all women from the committee. Mrs. Hol-
man, whose Willie was ill at home, and Mrs.
Lancelot Harrison, having grown accus-
tomed through long election to office to seats
at the top table, seemed to think all the
women-members should resign in a body ; but
as the genuine, in-a-daily-job presswomen are
used to sitting below the salt, they merely
yawned in response.
With a gaiety as solemn as that of the
Journalists, the Millions Club- enveloped the
drawing-room of the Australia. The smell
of moth-balls was loud in the land, for the
edict had gone forth on the invitations “Even-
ing- dress essential,” so the oldest member
reluctantly eiimbcd into his blacks, while
the girl of the family let down her woollies
and was smilingly brave in shoulder-strapped
neck-or-nothing. The Arthur Itickard family
being on its way oversea, the Club grew
reckless in its libations of stirrup-cup. Henry
Braddon shepherds the flock while his brother-
knight is abroad. Verbrugghen and his lady
were among those who surrounded the chair-
man and his black-satined lady during the
feast. Secretary Edwards was supported by
his pretty dark-haired wife, who wore a
white lace dress and rose-liued cheeks.
-V number of well-known people are in
mourning as the result of Mrs. Garvan’s
death at Rosemont, Woollahra, last week.
Her husband, who predeceased her, was J.
P. Garvan, at one time N. S. Wales Treas-
urer, and her sou John is prominent in the
assurance world, as his father was before
him. The youngest of the family, “Dicky,”
who was a ’Varsity student when the war
began, joined the R.F.A. and was killed in
Flanders. Nan Garvan worked practically
throughout the war —in Egypt and elsewhere
—with the Red Cross. Another sister mar-
ried Captain Prideaux-Brune, and a third is
Mrs. Laidley Dowling.
Shake hands with Albert Collins, Presi-
dent of the Commercial Artists’ Assoc, and
Sec. of the Society of Artists. He is a
Maorilandcr, but his
art is Australian,
and one of his great-
est claims to consid-
eration is th e fact
that no matter how
busied lie is with his
own affairs he can
still find time to help
committees that are
running Art or pos-
ter charity balls.
Ideas and sugges-
tions flowed from him
as water from a
playing fountain to
help the recent Arts
Ball in aid of the
Sydney Hospital, and
though modestly in
the background he
was one of the greatest factors in its success.
Campbell Ryrie, who was found dead in
his Coogee flat last week, was one of the
large, florid sporting family of brothers who
wefie born to Alex. Ryrie at Michelago, near
Cooma. All the Ryries who were anywhere
near the military age went to the war.
Granville, the General, was a brother of the
deceased, and so was Colonel Ryrie, who is
a regular soldier. The original Ryrie, who
was olie of the first to take tip land in the
Monaro district, had been a British officer.
Died last week, in Java, Mrs. .T. Faassen,
who was Ethel Brady, one of Sydney’s most
gifted musicians. Ethel, who taught in one
of the sky-reaching rooms of Paling’s, had
one of the largest connections in Sydney, and
for a while she conducted the orchestra at
the Australia. This put it into her head to
take a girls’ orchestra to Java about three
years ago to play at the Exhibition there.
It was at the Exhibition she met the man
she married about 12 months later. Ethel
lived to mother twins for just eight days.
Visiting dogman Crabtree was the centre
of a regular ballet of cutlet-legged poodles at
the Show Ground on Friday. Every poodle
or Peke or Pom of high degree had come out
to be judged, and they awaited the awards
cuddled like newly-born babes in the arms of
their prideful owners. Dame Margaret, with
Aide Egerton in attendance, enthroned on a
dais, watched the open-air proceedings till
the cold grew too much even for her fur-
wrapped, stout-slioed form. Then she took
herself in the pavilions, where all doggy Syd-
ney was gathered gazing at. the beauties in
the dog-boxes—beauties who were miserable
no matter whether they were adorned with
the blue or red or
yellow order. A small
boy just getting his
second teeth was whis-
pering to everybody
who came near him,
his cheeks blazing
with wind and ex-
citement, that his
dog Beauty had won
three prize blues,
and the Challenge,
and a Gold Spoon
all the way from the
Collie Club in Eng-
land. Beauty turned
out to be a fright-
fully aristocratic-
-look i n g creature,
whose long, tapering,
descended - from-the-
Stuarts nose was only saved from being
supercilious by the gentle melancholy of her
eyes. 'l’lie only entirely happy pair were two
little neighbor foxies, whose bonds were just
long enough to allow them to swap compli-
ments round each other’s barriers. As for
the bulls and the Irish terriers, they looked
as though Lloyd. George had flung the whole
solution of tin- Irish situation upon them,
and tin- gravity of the affair had just sunk
into their brains. But the Pokes and the
Poms, the poodles and t».-e pugs, in a pavilion
to themselves, luxuriated on satin cushions,
their boxes bung with satin drapings, royal
blue gold, pale pinks and blue, like a
baby’s creche. Indeed one puppy sat squeezed
into a tiny wooden cradle on the floor, while
what was apparently the family poodle sat
enthroned in splendor in the box above. This
is Judith Fletcher’s picture of Miss 0. P.
Brooke, who has been lion, secretary of
almost every Dog Show Sydney has ever
known.
No more will the spats and yellow dog-
skin gloves of Francis Bacon, one-time of
Humble station, add to the joy of Rand-
wick. A weak heart suddenly ceased .to tick
the other day. and Francis went to join the
wife who died some years ago, and the fine
son who was killed in the Gx-eat War.
The Cecil Horderns, of Ivirribilli, staged
the fashionable wedding of the week at St.
Philip’s, where they gave daughter Enid
Marcia into the keeping of Vero Read, of
Turramurra. The wedding dress was a foam
of ivory satin and lace, and the georgette
train, ballasted with a silver rose, was fol-
lowed by five bridesmaids dressed in different
tones of shot taffeta draped over silver lace
with silver tissue hats. One best man and
four groomsmen balanced the wedding group.
After Newby Fraser had pronounced the ver-
dict the bride’s parents entertained over 200
guests at the Wentworth,. Mrs. Cecil resplen-
dent in a sheath of royal-blue sequins over
black satin.
Captain and Mrs. Malcolm McGhee, who
are honeymooning- at llealesville I.Tie.), were
married at the Anglican Church, Balranald,
the other day. Both came from Tasmania,
the bride, being Mary Webster, daughter of
the late Dr. Webster, of Sorell, who lost his
only son in the war, and niece of Mrs.
Lewis Clifford, of Hobart. Lewis Clifford is
an elder brother of Captain Bede Clifford,
who was one of Gerald Strickland’s aides
in Sydney. All the children of the
present Baron Clifford of Chudleigh were
born in Tasmania, where the family lived
very humbly until pa came into the title,
whereupon Society bore down in an ava-
lanche. The McGhees are to live at Cressy,
in the Island State.
Florence Beatrice Neumann, eldest daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. IT. Neumann, of Laidley
(Q-), has made publie confession of her
engagement to Harold Charles Shirley, whose
people live in London or thereabout.
The C. of E. Grammar School Old Girls
chose the Paddington Town Hall for their
first ball; and, as befits a young things’ dance,
the decorations were ail pale pinks and
blues, ribbons and roses predominating. The
-school colors, dark blue and white, were worn
in wristlets by the committee, to which Marie
Jenkins and Amy Crouch had been the able
secretaries. Mrs. F. G. Sareood •
old Grammarian, was at the dance in’ hi,?'

Gonservatorium and later with Paderewski,
and has toured all over Europe. Already In

„ V isiting Australia now is Bernard Eliot
Yorke, brother of Lord Hardwicke. One
of the family, another Eliot, was here in the
late -’sixties with the Duke of Edinburgh, and
incidentally appeared in one act oi "Hamlet"
at a benefit show.
The Manly boat was braving the blast and
the heavy seas, when a lady decided to sed
the refuge of the women’s cabin. Half-way
down the stairs her legs were buffeted from
under her, and she did a rapid feet-foremost
dive into a milk-can that at the psychological
moment swayed towards her. The stunned
elderly party, seeing the froth and bubbles
all around her from the now overturned can,
decided she had struck the Harbor and
launched gallantly into sweeping breast-
strokes. Not for minutes after the deck-hands
had stood her right end up would she believe
she hadn’t had a stirring encounter with
Neptune.
French enthusiasts who live in the wilds
of Manly or Summer Hill have a new idea.
They propose to make the French Cafe in
Hunter-street a dining-place for the out-
of-towners on the weekly lecture nights. If
you suspect your accent of not being pure,
don’t sit down at the reserved tables, for
the salt and pepper will be passed only in
the French language.
The artists in Sydney are sighing over
the thought of a Melbourne without Tom
McNally's studio. Tom had his room close
to Menzies’, and even when the owner was
away on sketching expeditions the door stood
open ; and while there was a linger of whisky
left in the bot’tle the caller helped himself.
It was a kind of inner club to the artistic
world ; and a constant dropper-in for a yarn
and a laze was G.-G. Ronald Munro Fergu
son. But the studio is closed, and McNally
is seeking in the country the health that
deserted him when the ’flu made him a
victim.
A postscript from Brisbane: —
The latest engagement is that of Alice Duncan,
daughter of Mrs. Duncan, of Mooraberrie station, t,
F. C. Kemp, whose family has been on the Macleaj
River for nearly 100 years.
Amv and Eileen Castles are touring the Down
and finding the weather painfully cold. The new
hotel award has played the mischief with the com-
fort of travellers. In one town manager Johnm
Griffith' was seen wandering about clinging to sonv
raw meat and looking for a lady able and willing
to grill or fry it for the famished party.
Miss Large, the kindly lady who has been head
of the Brisbane Central Mixed School since 1905,
and who has now retired, left with a lapful of gifts
from her pupils, an address and an armchair from
the past and present staff.
The G.-G. and Lady Forster arrived on Thursday
night, and there was a civic reception next morn-
ing, the Red Cross annual meeting in the- afternoon
and a Government House ball at night. The race-
entertained the visitors on Saturday.
Rene Allom was married during the week to L. <■-
Cottew, of the Pacific Cable Station. Auckland
Daphne Allom was bridesmaid, and helped to pa-
the wedding cake at Twyford, the S. R. F. Allow-

Miss Sylvester Samuel, who down south was tin
guest of the G.-G. and Lady Forster, is here f nr
Show Week, and is staying at Government House.
Mary Macgregor, daughter of Queensland’s lan
Governor, lias written to old friends of her engage-
ment to T. Parker-Jervis. They will be married in

the fidelity of Columbia reproductions.

“I am more than delighted with my new

you have got my voice absolutely, which
has never been done before.”
Yours sincerely,

READ THIS ABODT
TEXAS SADDLES
Mr. Clyde Beale, of Leeton, via Yanoo, ha-
had one of our Texas Saddles, similar to
illustration, for over 12 months, and in a
letter states: —-
“I can say with the greatest confidence that
it is far superior to the ordinary Aussie for
rough and ready riding, and just as good for
long-distance riding as any other saddle. On onr
occasion I rode 400 miles in it with more com-
fort than I expected. A horse cannot roll over
on it, and there is less danger of one’s fool
catching in the wooden stirrups.”
There you have the opinion of a man
actually using the saddle under all
conditions.

. ...W.G.R.: See' if you can’t condense it into a
par.... Paula: “Stones” a bit too melodramatic....
1'.T.8.: Too wordy 1.F.M.: Cat-sparrow yarn
old T.P. : Yes, but sample is a long way below
par in interest.... E.M.Me.: Cut out any pars that
appear and send to accountant, who will remit....
Bat: Noah gave a flood visitor a D.S.O. for telling
him the baker story... .R.H.K.: There’s some good
work, but it hardly makes a yarn.... Lizard: Nearly ;
but Micky didn’t persuade he was rea1....M.M.R.:
Replies so far have, generally, been discouraging... .
F. : Must go back.. .. J.M.W.: It doesn’t hang on
to the reader.. .The Reed: Fails... R.A.J,: The verse
isn’t good enough to carry it I.L.K. (Hobart):
Nothing there... .T.O. (Oapella): No g00d....

prose. .. . A.J.S.: A story there, but you don’t tell
1 it. Try again. .. .F.C.M.: Not 1ip.... Warrigal:
The yarn goes back Henry 8.,: So frail a story

the wicked eye to the first man she met... .R.11.C:
“Debating Club” is ponderous fooling... .McGlant:
The bare fact that a hard-drinking bushman got his
ears cut off isn’t enough to make a yarn... .C.Y.8.:
About as good as the average American picture-show
tale. .. .Madeline B.: Vigorous, but no value here....
Italphus B.: No use to us....Novic: Even a compli-
ment falls heavily in such verse.... Oliver B.: It
has the real tang:—
T’other day two strangers blew in our town.
t sual type of commission travellers.
With ’em they ’ad their luggage. Matilda and half-a-
crown.
Came in, sat dovai along some other fellers.
Both seemed full when they lobbed in the Settlers'
Inn.
“Any work anywhere around this joint?
We're workers.” Then some began to grin.
“We ’aven’t done nothing for months, we ain’t.”
“Well, what work can you do?”
“Take what we can get, anything.”
"There’s a man out here can do with two.”
“What for?” “Why, for emu-bobbing.”
. ...T.H.M.: Let’s have a look at it, will you ,J
Yal F.: None score a pass. ... A.F.C.: Yes, we pay
ior the verse we print. But yours is far below stand-

Foolish little thing. .. .A. F.B: Nothing in the in-
cident. .. .Athenian: Small idea badly handled. . .

If you listen to Liberal or Labor dope.
Norman C.: Poor little flutter E.H.S.: The
verses are bad in construction and the thought is
commonplace. .. .Florence G.: Very weak.... J.A.W.;
You’re a sorrowful person. .. . M.8.J.: Not up....
Dogears (or something like that): Nearly; but it
wants a few stops to make it mean anything....
W.J.S.: “Gills” has a lilt that sings its way invo
the coldest heart: —
You may think it forward
Or you may thing it rude
For a girl to go forward and ask for a kiss.;
It’s nothing unusual when she thinks she is scrude
In a sort of out-of-the-way place like this.
You will often see them spooning away
And their actions sometimes look rude ;
To go round the corner just for a kiss,
She says is no harm, because she is scrude
In a sort of out-of-the-way place like this.
. ...W.H.K.: Well handled as far as it goes, but it
doesn’t go far enough.... Ende Avour: The struggle
to be humorous is a bit too obvious here and there.
But there should be good pars, in 8i11.... Llewelyn
L.: Moves daintily; but so slight... .Housewife:
Your spring blowfly has one virtue, anyway—it
buzzed in early J.P. (N.Q).: The thought is too
commonplace. . . .Honi Soit: Thanks ; but we couldn’t
print that.... Kuaka: One is fine; the other must
gc back. .. .M.JK. (Randwiek) : Not well enough
done. ... Inglewood: Been better said. .. .Thirty-
five: According to latest available figures M.L.
has 22 p.c. of Scotch birth and Australia 15
p.c. Your other statements are correct.... 11. P.:
This also misses; but try again, and keep it short.
Humbug: Not worth it E.J.H.: Interest
doesn’t balance space... .Ex-Soldat: All out-of-date.
. ...L.E.G.: A bit thin... .0.M.E.: Too vinegary ;
couldn’t you poke fun at them more kindly?....
W.H.T. Not worth space H.J.R. (Tas.): 11. B.
Irving was the eldest son of the late Sir Henry
Irving; Ethel Irving is the daughter of the late
Joseph Irving (also an actor) and no relation to Sir
Henry.... The Toad: Not enough in dog yarn....
Barwidgee: Not up.... Sawdust King: Much too
wordy J.R.M.: “Dogs’ Souls” misses J.B.
(Q.): Try again... .Joe: That photo has been pub-
lished several times.... Agag: Those letters have

drawing, though not without merit.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
JN all rain fall the unstanched tears of
sorrow;
Each fair, tall tree may lift its dying
Christ;
The sunset with the moonrise, night with
morrow,
Keeps ever ifs eternal thwarted tryst.
The bloody dews of pain on trampled grasses
Lie like the sweat of some self-martyred
God :
And though through all our woods white
Beauty passes,
Upon what primal anguish has she trod !
Our seas are wistful; at their sapphire
verges
Our heart’s desire, a rainbow shadow,
stands;
And where the sea-blue with the sky-blue
merges
There is the beckoning of immortal hands.
But every flower whose brief transfiguration
Has been begotten by decay and strife
Seems ever utt’ring a mute revelation
To that scarred captive who is conscious
life.
And those Olympian clouds whose sunset
glory
With fleeting rapture crowns the darken-
ing world,
Ah, do they not. show forth the same dumb
story
In all their shapes of splendor lightly
curled !
Long, long ago a garden by a city
Held a new tomb where no man had been
laid,
And there they brought the corpse of Love
and Pity,
And sealed the grave, and wont away
afraid.
For through the hands of Love had nails
been driven,
And through his feet ; a spear had pierced
his side:
With his last breath his foes he had forgiven,
Yet on a gallows Love had hung and died.
But with the third day’s morning came the
wonder,
The empty tomb, the fear, the voice, the
fight—
For risen Love had rent His grave asunder,
And in His hands the wounds were dia-
mond-bright.
Bli, sunset-splendors whose uuuttered. mes-
sage
Strives with the dark bereavement of the
night!
fhi, piteous flowers whose transient beauties
presage
The deep Elysiau meadows of delight !
This is the grave of Love! But on the
morrow
Beyond the sea, beyond the sunset’s
breath, .
Beyond the senses and beyond their sorrow
We Khali find Love in the white dawn of
Death.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
old beachcomber's hut stood ou the
sandy shore, jSKJO yards beyond the last
hut in the village. It was not built
like tin; rest of the native houses, on piles
over the sea. It. stood above the reach of
the highest tides, and at a distance looked
like a rubbish-dump, with its walls of plaited
iiipa-palm leaf. Around it was a fence of
iiDtriinnted saplings, some of which had taken
toot and sprouted in the soft, wet sand, while
others had crumbled to a heap of brown dust.
The missionary said it was a disgrace to the
village—it and As occupants, old Toni Six-
pence and his (Joarihari woman t'nia.
As the hut stood apart from the rest of the
village, so its owners kept aloof from the
villagers. The man, once a recruiter and
trader, now down at heels and living native
fashion, was an object of scorn and derision
to both brown and white; the woman, an
outlander from the West, was without friends
in the village, for she wore a sihi, like any
hushman, and no decent grass petticoat, like
a well-brought-up native woman should.
Even the tiny toddlers in the village
swayed and swished their short grass skirts
at her as slie passed to draw water; the
•toys shouted accusations of cocoanut-stealing
and garden-rilling, for how else could she
'he, when she had but three cocoa nut palms,
and evervohe knew that she had planted her
•sweet-potatoes too late last North-West to
catch the rains, and had dug up roots only fit
to feed to the pigs?
The Resident Magistrate had had many
complaints as to her stealing front the gar-
dens; but as the village folk dared not go
out after dark, for fear of being caught by
the ghosts of their dead, they could give
no proofs. Old Tom was rarely seen beyond
the lence nowadays, and the village people
>aid that he was quite kavu-kava (mad),
and no longer drank the mura-mura from the
bottle, like he used to and mura-mura
which made him shout and sing and beat
bnia until she screamed that he was killing
“ er - No doubt, said they, he gave Unia
Plenty of money, or she would not stay and
work for him, fishing and grubbing in the
’■ttle garden on the hillside. White men
•nways had plenty of money, and one cook-
J JIj V had heard his Taubada say that, in his
'•vyn land, old Sixpence was a big blaguna,
, h many wives and much land, though if
, at "ere true why did he live in a little
with Unia?
The missionary, too. wondered lmw the
kept alive: but when he tried to visit
h e had such discourtesy shown him
. 'at he left them to their own devices. He
•; r| ew that gossip had it that Tom had seen
•auch better days. Some even went so far
/ to say that he was the degenerate son of
■' noble house: but, then, they said that of
■'ery good-looking scallywag who obviously
fP. e a wrong name. Still it was known
nat he regularly drew enough money to
keep him drunk for two or three weeks,
'Pending the thirsty intervals, in cadgin^
sixpences to assuage his desperate thirst.
.Latterly he had disappeared from the haunts
of white men; but the bank manager was
the only one interested enough to make
inquiries as to his whereabouts, and that
only because the derelict had not been to
draw his remittance. It was not a bank
manager’s business to run after his clients,
anyway.
The North-West came in early, and the-
yams and sweet potatoes had been harvested
and eaten, and the seeds set for the next
year, when the shipping strike stopped all
supplies. Rice, flour and tinned meat rose
to fabulous prices in the stores, and then
gave out altogether as far as the natives
were concerned. The white people were
on short commons, and no one knew when
the next boat would come. To make mat-
ters worse, the lakatois came back from the
west with but little sago in exchange for
their earthen pots, though they brought betel-
nut in plenty. Chewing betel-nut certainly
staves off the pangs of hunger, but that
way madness lies, and Loliia, the village
constable, took not a few men to gaol, for
they had chewed to ease their empty bellies
and the madness had come upon them, and
they had run amok in the houses, breaking
everything in their way.
Whilst the excitement of the return of the
first lakatoi was at its height, sorrow came
to the house of EgO-Masi. Her little son,
a toddler of two years, was lost. He had
been playing on the sands with the other
children, who had, at the cry of "Sail oh !”
run to greet the returned wanderers. When
Ins father, Mo-Rai, had inquired for the
child he was nowhere to be found. Search
was made, and the bereaved mother lay roll-
ing and screaming on the ground, scratching
her face until the blood ran. It was
thought that the child had scrambled on to
the platform of the hut, and fallen over into
deep water, and been swept away by the
falling tide.
A week later Loliia toiled up the steep
path to the magistrate’s house with a serious
face. He said that a puri-puri had been
cast on the village. Laurua had gone into
the bush with Ins black dog to see if he
could replenish the family larder with a
magani or two. He had been seen coming back
at dusk, close to the village, with his dog
at his heels, and two hindquarters of magani
on his shoulder. From that time all trace
of him had vanished. His dog returned
home the same night, howling and running
about /,'« Vti-kara, and then he, too, had dis-
appeared, and 1 lie people were .saying that a
lun-lau (ghost) had taken Laurua, his dog.
and possibly Ego's little son, too, and all
were afraid to stir from the houses.
A fruitless search was made, and Tom
Sixpence, as well as every other householder
in the village, had to have his house
searched, to the indignation of Fnia. Tom
was lying on the rough bed when the .sergeant
appeared, and Unia motioned that he must
not be disturbed. The respect for a white
man, however debased, made the sergeant
obey her gestures; but lie saw by the twitch-
ing limbs that all was not well with poor
Tom Sixpence. Still if did not seem as if
there were any lack of food, for there was
meat boiling in an earthen pot over the drift-
wood fire, and giving forth a savory smell, so
that the Sergeant, who was on short rations
at the barracks, felt his mouth water.
That night the Resident Magistrate was
lying on his stretcher bed in the mosquito
room. As he listened to the buzz of the mos-
quitoes round the net, lie heard the patter-
patter of feet on the bare boards of the veran-
dah, followed by the most heart-rending howl
lie had ever heard. Some village dog, he
thought, coining to forage for food, and he
reached for a boot. As he looked out he saw
a large black dog standing on the top step,
and as he poised the boot to throw it gave
vent to 'another blood-curdling howl. As
he once more settled himself down, he could
hear the same unearthly noise in the dis-
tance.
The next morning weary men discussed
ways and means of getting rid of such a per-
sistent disturber of the peace. It; had gone
the round (ft the houses, and expressed its
feelings under each verandah. Cartridges
were bought, and no one would have taken
an insurance on that dog’s life for a shilling
that morning. Rut when night after night
went by, and the howling pest eluded its pur-
suers, opinions began to be freely stated that
it. was what the village had named it, a sisia
baigona —a phantom dog.
A rigorous search failed to find a dog
answering to the description. The villagers
with one accord swore that the only dog like
it had belonged to Laurua, and had dis-
appeared with him. Night after night the
phantom ran the gauntlet of distracted hus-
bands, who, chivvied by nervous wives, sat in
wait, for him. A reward was offered for
his capture, dead or alive, but all that re-
sulted was that sundry village dogs, approxi-
mating to his description, came to an
untimely end.
A silver bullet was finally cast, and pre-
sented to the most noted shot amongst the
native police, the sergeant. That night he
waited, as he had done many previous nights,
under the shadow of the barracks verandah.
The moon was at the full, and the howls drew
near. It was an agony of .sound, like the
lament of a soul in everlasting torment.
The waiting man could hear the wailing of
the women down at the village, for another
child had disappeared that day in broad day-
light. One moment it was there, the next it
had gone. The women were keening their
sympathy with the stricken parents.
Under the big mango-tree the black dog
squatted on his haunches, and, flinging up his
head, poured forth his sorrows to the wonder-
ing stars. Crack went the sergeant’s rifle:
the silver bullet sped its way, and a howl as
from no mortal dog’s throat quivered and
died away. The sergeant rushed from his
hiding-place to examine the carcase. To his
dismay, carcase there was none, but in the
silver light of the moon he could see, trotting
across the parade-ground, in the direction of
the village, the black dog, apparently making
for home. Hoping that lie had wounded
him, the sergeant made after him. Through
the village they rushed, and along the sandy
beach, until the dog disappeared from view
through a gap in the fence round the hut
belonging to old Tom Sixpence. The ser-
geant crept through after him, rifle in hand,
and ready to fire again if opportunity offered.

Those agonising twinges across the small of the back,
that dull, throbbing ache, may be your warning of
serious kidney weakness —serious if neglected, for it
might easily lead to grayel, stone, bladder inflammation,
dropsy, or fatal kidney disease. So if you are suffering
with a bad back, look for other proof of kidney trouble,
and if there are dizzy spells, headaches, nervous despon-
dent attacks; a dull, tired condition and disordered
kidney action, get after the cause. Take things easier for
a while and use DOAN’S BACKACHE, KIDNEY PILLS,
the remedy that has been tested for you by thousands.
What satisfied users say is the best proof of Doan s
reliability.
STRAIGHTFORWARD STATEMENTS BY SYDNEY PEOPLE.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Geo. A. Skinner, 37 Goodhope Street. Paddington, says“As the result
of a bad cold which settled on my kidneys I suffered agony from backache, and was
often so bad that I had to lie up, not being able to move without endunng torture
The kidney secretions were very much disordered, being thick and cloud>, and i
could not even turn in bed without a stab-like pain striking me across the loins. J
took all kinds of kidney medicines, but nothing gave me any permanent relief, and
I was at a loss to know what to do for a cure. A friend, hearing how I was
suffering, suggested I should try Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. 1 bought some
at once, and after taking them for a few days, I was delighted to find they were
doing me good. In a week or so I felt ever so much better, and by the time had
used'five or bottles I was completely cured. That was two years ago. and I
am still well, but I .always keep Doan’s B"oWbe Kidney PJls in the house and
take them now and again, as a tonic for the kidneys.”
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. A. Weir, 168 Botany Road. Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“ln common
with many others, I can give Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a first-class recom-
mendation as a cure for backache and kidney disorder, these p’lls having cured me
of a bad attack some few months ago. Before I took these p’lls 1 suffered terribly
with my back, it being so stiff and painful that I could hardly get about: in fact,
1 have been so bad that I have had to lie up, being almost crippled with the pain.
My ankles and legs swelled considerably, and were sore to the touch, and i was
also subject to dizzy attacks. I could not get proper rest at night, and m conse-
quence always felt dull and tired, and had no energy. However, a course of Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills soon put an end to my health troubles, and I have been
grand ever since.” . i . n ~ , .
Six years later Mrs. Weir confirms the above: — lam stdl well, and
had no return of my old complaint since- Doan’s Pills cured me over six j ears ago.

Creeping round the humpy, he could hear
sounds of violent scratching, and through the
shelter of shaggy palm-leaves hanging
from the hut wail he could see the dog paw-
ing the earth from under a pile of driftwood
heaped ready for the tire. As the earth flew
up the sergeant could see shiuiug white boues
appear. Then he fired once more, and a
responsive howl assured him that he had
found his mark. When he gained the place,
to his astonishment all he could see was the
freshly-dug earth and a scattered heap of
bones. The phantom dog had vanished.
Stooping down to examine the bones, he
heard soft footfalls behind him, and turned
just in time to ward off a violent blow.
Then he closed with his assailant. Well it
was for him that he had spent many weary
hours on the parade ground, on the bars
and the vaulting horse, for it took all his
well-trained muscles to withstand the attack
of the scratching, clawing, biting fiend that
fought him. At last he gained the mastery,
and reaching his rifle stunned his opponent
with the butt. Dragging the body from
the shadow of the woodpile into the moon-
light he was astonished to fiud that it was
Uuia, the Goaribari wife of Tom Sixpence.
The bones in the earth, the tiny skulls, the
bones of a dog and a couple of maganis, and
those of a full-grown man told the sergeant
the grisly truth.
Tying his prisoner with some strands torn
from his rami, he entered the dismal house.
Tom Sixpence was still lying on the bed.
lie turned his dull eyes to the light as the
sergeant kicked the embers of the fire to a
blaze. But the log of a body that lay there
would never of its own volition move again.
Tom Sixpence was hopelessly paralysed. The
bubbling pot was still on the fire with its
horrid stew.
The sergeant hurried back to report, tak-
ing with him the great pineapple club with
which Unia had intended to fell him, and
with which she had butchered her victims.
Doubtless it was a relic of former cannibal
days from her own home in the west, for it
was said that she was the daughter of a
chief well known for his man-eating. When
she recovered consciousness she asked for
Tom Sixpence and was told that he had been
taken away. She turned her face to the
wall and refused to speak or eat again, and
with the native’s easy faculty for death she
died, unwilling to live without the man for
whom she had fought hunger in her own way.
With the interment of the bones in the
little native cemetery the midnight wander-
ings of the phantom dog ceased, and folks
once more slept undisturbed by its wailings.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONE thing I like about beer —apart from
the flavor —is the power it possesses
of temporarily stirring a man’s
imagination till it expands and scintillates
to the point of sublimity. , It is well, of
course, that the effect of beer is only tem-
porary. Otherwise we would be living in
an age of cranky brilliance which would
inevitably become nerve-racking to the
average plain man.
We were sitting under the verandah of
the Traveller’s Best Hotel when the dere-
lict drifted in on tne hot north wind. Idly
we watched him as he came from afar across
the pjain in the haze of heat, a lonely, plod-
ding ngure without even the companionsnip
of a dog. llis arrival revealed an ordinary
nomad of the back country. He was
dressed in the usual manner, and wore
sandy, irresponsible-looking whiskers and a
commonplace swag. Also he brought a
number of quite unnecessary flies to join
the swarm at the Travellers’ Rest.
“Good-day, chaps,” he said sociably and
hopefully. “It’s a cow of a day!”
We greeted him, and agreed about the
cow, and someone suggested drinks. luto
the bar we filed and shoved our collective
thirst down a few inches. It seemed a bit
cooler in the bar, so we stayed there; and
through the afternoon we sat and yarned
and punctuated our conversation with
fillemupagams, and watched the world
become a better place. The derelict had
no money, apparently, but he stopped pints
with praiseworthy persistence and grew
happy. He even offered to oblige the com-
pany with a song; but just then the public-
house cockatoo waddled into the circle and
gl.bly burst into profanity; so the derel.et,
being sufficiently beer-inspired, was moved
to reminiscence, and gave us a yarn instead.
The flies buzzed dully round us in the
drowsy afternoon heat as we sat on the
forms, the publican lolled comfortably over
the bar, and the delightful odor of beer per-
vaded the room ; and altogether there was a
capital settin- for a story.
“Ever been in the Speewaa country? No?
Well, then, you’ve missed a treat. Never
in me born days ’ave I seen a place to equal
it—what with water an’ shade an’ no flies
an’ th'ngs. But it ain’t the country I was
thinkin’ about—it’s a bird that this ’ere
cockatoo reminded me of. O’ course ’e wasn’t
like this cove, my bird wasn’t. This cove’s
built for speech, but mine was built for
speed an’ injurance.
“We was cornin’ down from the Gulf,
about 15 year ago, with a mob o’ cattle-
twelve hund’ed head it was if I remember
right—an’ it was a fair pleasure trip. A
man name o’ Harry Jamieson was in charge,
an’ our destination was Bourke. We ’ad
a fine outfit, an’ I don’t suppose you ever
seen a better crowd o’ stockmen in one lot—
me an’ Andy Garrett, an’ Larry Mackenzie,
an’ long Charlie Golding, an’ Jim Bowles,
an’ Tom Campbell an’ the rest of ’em —every
one a top-notcher like you don’t see nowa-
days.
“Well, we travelled a month or two till
we come to the Speewaa country, an’ the
boss decided to take it easy there. There’s
no place in Australia to eoual that part—
grass saddle-high all the year round, always
green from passing thunderstorms, and
plenty o’ good creeks to camp on. M e
camped for a fortnight on one creek called
the Billygobang; an’ it was there I found
my bird first evening we made the camp. I
was strolling down the creek havin' a smoke
when I noticed it flutterin’ alonsr the ground
ahead of me. It w r as a bit too young to
fly, so *1 caught it after a run, an’ I knoo
straight away I’d made a find. It was a
most peculiar animal as birds go—a sort o’
greyisu-blue color, with a body about as big
as a magp.e s, a long, hard beak, an’ a top-
knotch something Lke an anchovy duck, -but
it was tiie wings that puzzled me. They was
not much wider ’n two of yer fingers, but
was iuily four foot from tip to up. 1
dunno yet if that bird was a freak, or
whether it belonged to a race.found only in
the Speewaa country. Back at the camp
uone o’ the blokes could tell me its name,
but Larry reckoned it was a cross between
a sparrer-hawk an’ sometkmk.
"Some’ow that bird took ter me at once.
I petted it an fed it, o' course; but any
time I've got a sorter way with me with
b.rds. I couider made a pile if I’d a took
up trainin’ birds for circuses and the like o’
that
“Well, about three days after I’d caught
it, the littie cove took to dying’, an’ the lot
of us could ’ardly bel.eve what we see then,
Tfaere was never a hawk, duck or p geon
could live on the wing with it. You’d just
see a sorter flash o’ wings an’ hear a wlnz
an’ he was out o’ sigot, an’ back 'e’d come
the same way. I use ter sling tilings to Tin
an’ ’e never missed catchin’ ’em. If it
was tucker ’e scolied it, but if it was any-
thing else ’e fetched it buck to me. One
•sr*, 1 v-r. sr;
oO yaids away. I hen I hears a flip an a
snap, an afore that stone reached the budick
the bird ad caught it an dropped it back
in my hand. 1 he coves eoulcin t speak aoove
a swear, they was that thunderstiuck. lhree
tunes I tiled un, an each t.me it wao tli
same. We summed it up then an decided
the bird was a pure retriever. Day after
day we practised, an then what you d call
the climax Come. I took my old rifle out
to knock over a kangaroo. About halt-a-
mile away I spots a mob an sorts out an
old buck. The bird was standing near me
when I takes aim an’ fires. At tne same time
as the rifle bangs I bears the bird s wings
go swish, an’ ’e disappears. In a second or
two back ’e comes with something in is
beak. I put out me ’and, an e crops it in.
It was the bullet—so red-’ot that I couldn't
hold it. I sat down an’ rubbed me face to
see if I was awake. I was awake all r ght,
but just about ’alf-dead with surprisement.
I dunno ’ow I got back to the camp, but 1
managed it some’ow, an’ dropped down all
of a tremble. The blokes seen something was
wrong, an’ asked me to give ’em the strength
of it. W’en I told ’em they could not be-
lieve it, but I fired the rifle at a tree, an'
the same thing ’appened again. Fer five
minutes all ’ands just sat an’ gaped. Then
Andy Garrett jumps up an’ slaps ’is leg.
“‘l’ve got it. Spinifex,’ ’e says to me.
‘Take the bird down to the towns an’ make
yer fortune! Put up notices about “Perfes-
sor Spinifex Jackson’s wonderful Retriever-
bird from the Speewaa,” an’ give demon-
sterations, an’ you’ll coin money ! All the
other perfessors an’ natchrilists will be fol-
lerin’ you about, an’ every nubTl be free to
yer. Man, that bird’s a gold-mine!’
“I comc-to a bit then, an’ me an’ Andy
started to make plans. (I took h'm into
partners, o’ course, for suggestin’ it.) I
was to be the perprietor. an’ Andv led to
do the spoutin’ an’ interviewin’ the scien-
tists an’ makin’ a pedigree for the bird, an’
tellin’ of its capture in the wild Speewaa
country.
“Alter a bit we moved on with the cattle
trayellin’ sou -east, an’ that bird doing won
derful retrieving acts all the way. i-.vc..
one o’ the coves wanted to buy it, an' tin
boss ottered me half the cattle an’ no dr. ,
ing expenses if I’d deal, but I hung on a:
see ineseif do.ng the towns an’ shows an
then settlin’ down in a pub.
“I suppose it would be three weeks lat<•;
we come to a river they called the Murra
binalong, an’ decided on another camp
Now, tnere s a curious place mere—a ghnj
running down to a broad patch o’ water
between two lulls; an’ what with the big
trees round about an’ the curious formation
of the ground a man lias only got to speak
above a whisper to hear the echo go bark
wards an’ forwards till there seems no end
of it. They call it Echo Gully. Some peopl.
reckoned the place was haunted. An ordi-
nary cough would go for hair a day; an
Tom Campbell reckoned he passed through
there three days alter one cove who used <
smg a bit, an’ ’e heard the ehorus of ‘Tin
Wild Colonial Boy’ still going strong.
“Well, we makes a camp an’ I parks m
the old i-ilie, aims ’er ut a tree across tin
gully an’ lets blaze. In a second or tw
you d ha’ thought a crowd o’ soldiers \va>
firing; there was nothing but bang! ban?
bang ! from oue side to another. O’ count
the bird went off in a flash an’ brought bad
the bullet; but in a second it was oft’ again
backwards an’ forwards, an’ then I under-
stood —that bird was chasin’ the eelml
Didn’t the coves laugh—me too! An’ that
set more echoes goin’. Pretty soon I so
it was serious. 1 called to ’im an’ started
another echo, an’ w’en ’e squeaked back in
answer it started another one still, until
the bloomin’ noise was deafening. The
coves shifted camp about a. mile from the
gully, but I just stayed there in the hope*
of my bird stopping. All night, long I sat
there listening to the swish of his wings, an
now an’ then I called ’im, but it only added
to the echoes, an' by-nn’-bye I had to plug
me ears, or I'd ’a’ gone mad or deaf or
somethin)?. Next day was the same- 1
stayed there without a bite, burrin’ wot tie
coves brought mo. They tried to kid me
away, but 1 wouldn’t go. I slung bits o’ tie
tucker in the air an’ fed the bird like that,
but ’e wouldn’t stop for a drink.
“Another night came an’ went, an’ still
the chase went on. 1 knew the bird wa>
getting done. He was flyin’ slower—you
could tell by the spaces between the swishe-
w’en ’e turned, an’ ’e wouldn’t answer tim
w’en I give a call. On the next evening
Atjdv comes to me with a plan.
“ ‘Fire the rifle again,’ ’e says, 'an' tv m
’e brings back the bullet grab ’im.’
“It’s a wonder I hadn’t thought of it
before, it was so simple. Anyway. 1 tires
just ns ’e turned, an’ a second or two later
back ’e comes with the bullet. But l didn't
need to grab ’im! ’E just drops it in nn
’and, gives a bit of a flutter an’ a sorrowful
sorter squeak, an’ falls dead at me feet. An'
then I see his wings was wore down to tin
bone.”
The derelict buried bis emotions an<i
part of his face in another pint, and dried
his whiskers with his hat.

A Long Step

Every sportsman knows what it
means to have his day’s hunting
spoiled on account of his car y
tridges becoming damp and unfit for use.
For many years cartridge manufacturers
have experimented to perfect a method of
making their shotgun cartridges impervious
to dampness under all conditions.
Remington experts have at last developed a
process—known as “WETPROOF”—which has
been patented and is controlled by this company.
Our factory loaded shotgun cartridges subjected
to the “WETPROOF” treatment —as are all the
Remington UMC brands—will withstand without
damage to their shooting qualities such con-
ditions as rain, dampness, or actual immersion
for a considerable period of time, which are
ruinous to ordinary cartridges, and which are often
encountered in the held.
