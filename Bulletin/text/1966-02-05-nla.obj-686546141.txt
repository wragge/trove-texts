ASK GRACE BROS
Because they've done it. Oniy Grace Bros. Removals are
qualified to move an Embassy “across the world." And not
just because they’re big either. But because they care —
care for big things and care about small things.
This job required extra-special cdre, because all the furnish-
ings were brand new. And the packing cases required special
design—able to withstand salt air and at least five different
loading operations! Care comes from planning. By the way,
Grace Bros, not only moved this furniture —they supplied it,
too! Right down to the light switches —and ail they had for
reference were a set of architect's blueprints and some
pictures. Now that’s an example of what Grace Bros, have
done. If you have a removals
problem—make the easy deci-
sion (and make the right one).

Davis Cup 8 station telecast
makes TV history
For the first time, almost 1,000,000 families
throughout Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania
could watch each exciting stroke of the Davis Cup
as it happened in Sydney . . . thanks to GTV9,
Melbourne.
Courtside cameras at White City Stadium in
Sydney relayed Davis Cup matches direct to GTV9
by co-axial cable. The signal was transmitted in
fpur directions —to Victorian country stations,
Adelaide, and to Launceston and Hobart.
The telecast gave several million people on holi-
days a chance to see close-up action in the world’s
premier tennis event. For the first time in Australian
television, 80,000 families in Tasmania could view
a continuous live mainland telecast.
Sponsors— Viscount Cigarettes, Kays Rent-A-Car,
and Australian Consolidated Industries sponsored
the programme nationally and the GTV9 control-
centre integrated and co-ordinated the commercials
with participating stations.
For television leadership that means
better, more imaginative programming
for viewers and advertisers—look to
GTV Channel 9.

ONE MORE
WEEK
Mon for the job
NSW’s NEW GOVERNOR, Sir Roden
Cutler, is obviously the man for the job,
but what on earth is the job? One which,
according to “The Sydney Morning
Herald” editor, J. D. Pringle, writing
for the London “Observer”, says Aus-
tralians feel is “increasingly irrelevant
and out of date”. So Mr Pringle may not
be one of the “trade union leaders, writers
and businessmen” Sir Roden is reported
to want around his luncheon table.
The Buckingham Palace luncheons,
which Sir Roden says he plans to copy,
were one of the most disastrous public
relations efforts ever attempted by British
royalty. It was only as a result of them
that it became entirely clear that a life
spent on or around horses does not equip
anyone for conversation with a country’s
top brains.
Sir Roden at his initial Press conference
invited people to tell him “if I ever be-
come pompous”. Glad of the opportu-
nity, we record that he went on to say: “I
hope the people will realise that when
I’m off duty I want to get away quietly
and lead a normal life. That privilege
is accorded to the Queen when she goes
to the Windsor Horse Show. When I
go to the beach at the weekend, I would
appreciate the same attitude from the
public”.''With the spectacles our beaches
currently offer it seems hardly likely that
the Governor and his lady would get
more than a glance. In fact, we should
imagine that the last Governor who
caused much commotion among the
populace when he appeared on the beach
was Phillip.
Honor -
THE AUSTRALIAN of the Year is
dancer Robert Helpmann, who does not
live in his own country, does not wish
to live in it and certainly could not
afford to, financially or artistically. So
much for Australia.
The honor, for what it is worth, has
come to Helpmann at the end of the
Australian Ballet’s overseas tour. Since
his appointment as joint artistic director
of the company last March, Helpmann
has shed considerable lustre on it and
has opened difficult stage-doors for it
overseas. He has also mounted some of
its successful new ballets.
We would not want to disparage
Helpmann in any way, but, if the Aus-
tralian Ballet is to be obliquely honored,
what of the other joint artistic director,
Peggy van Praagh? Miss van Praagh has
put in four years with the company, has
had all the fret and frustration of re-
cruiting and training dancers, of weather-
ing criticism after a disastrous first sea-
son, of travelling around Australia on
a seven-day, six-night week with the
company. Miss van Praagh lives in Aus-
tralia, but we mustn’t forget she is a
Pom.
New deal
PRIME MINISTER HOLT has in-
dicated that he will meet the Canberra
Press more often than his predecessor
did, although he hasn’t promised a week-
ly conference and although 8.45 a.m.,
his chosen time, may not be the favorite
hour of day for Gallery journalists.
The Melbourne “Age’s” television
writer has provided an interesting answer
to criticisms of the Press at Menzies’s
farewell conference. The writer points
out that Sir Robert’s infrequent con-
ferences were really only TV spectaculars
with himself as compere and star and
the journalists as extras. “Sir Robert ap-
parently preferred his television news
conferences to be entertainment rather
than a serious search for information,”
he writes. “Because of this the Canberra
political correspondents have chosen in
recent years to be spectators instead of
participants. They believe their task is
to obtain “hard” news for their own
newspapers. They saw no point in ex-
posing themselves to the sharp edge of
Sir Robert’s tongue, or in scooping them-
selves by acting as unpaid interviewers
for the television channels.”
One picture is worth a thousand
words. Most overseas newspapers, parti-
cularly in America where both “Time”
and “Newsweek” used it, felt that the
photograph of Prime Minister Holt with
his three bikini-clad step-daughters-in-law
at Portsea outlined the transition from
the Menzies era to the Holt better than
columns of type could.

mal prices is fees paid to mannequins
and models. This is the first time there
has been a set scale and it is considerably
higher than current rates. So many of
Sydney’s models belong to the June Dally-
Watkins or Pat Woodley agencies, which
are together on this, that large-scale fee-
cutting by photographers will be impos-
sible.
Models on the scale will be graded
Premier, A Grade or B Grade. This
meat-market approach is perfectly logic-
al. A girl’s grading is not based on the
agency’s evaluation of her charms but on
how much she is in demand. Apparent-
ly, everyone is happy. The girls will earn
more, the agencies will get more com-
mission, the photographers will charge
more, the advertising agencies will in-
crease their budgets, and, of course, the
manufacturer in his turn will pass it on
.to the consumer. But by then you won’t
know what hit you. v j

THIS AUSTRALIA
POLITICS
The Climate of Change
The climate of supreme authority is traditionally supposed to change the per-
sonality of the person who lives in it. Mr Harold Holt, 57, Australia’s new Prime
Minister, last week conformed with the tradition. He was not quite the same person
as he was the previous week.
He joked with Pressman as he always
has. But the jokes had a different
flavor —an undertone of seriousness—as
though he were conscious that he was
on a higher, lonelier level. He made
his points with the same aplomb and
the same ease of manner. But there was
a suggestion of hardening steel under
the velvet. Even his style of speech
seemed to change a little. Over recent
years—probably you can date it from
the time he took over the Treasury—he
has been inclined towards prosiness and
never letting one word suffice where he
could use three or four. But he was
terse and to the point in his comments
in his new role as Prime Minister.
His Ministers? They were on trial.
Not one of them, including himself, had
been underwritten as to future service
in the Ministry. He was as urbane as
ever. Wherever he could he worked in
a nice thing to say about his colleagues.
But underlying what he said was the
suggestion that he was no longer keeping
goal for his predecessor, Sir Robert
Menzies, but he was playing to win—
and he expected his team to play to win.
Interestingly, he seemed to think that
many of his problems might emerge on
the external front. Possibly this was
due to the fact that he felt that in having
William McMahon, the senior NSW
Minister, in Treasury he had a good
backstop on the local front. Holt knows
that McMahon shares the philosophy
that guided him almost exclusively be-
fore he fell under Treasury influence—
the belief that Australians may accept all
kinds of blunders on the part of the
Government, even hardships, but that if
unemployment went beyond a point
which as Holt himself accurately says
other countries would accept as full em-
ployment the Government, under whose
regime such unemployment developed,
would be turned out of office. It may
have been due to the then impending
visit from the British Secretary of De-
fence, Mr Healey, who is now in Can-
berra trying to persuade the British
Government’s view that Australia, as the
country most vitally concerned, must
contribute more towards the defence re-
sponsibilities that Britain now has in the
South-East Asian area.
Whatever the reason Holt has made it
clear that he expects external affairs and
the allied issue of national defence to
occupy Ministers’ attention increasingly
in the months ahead. He quite obviously
went a long way towards strengthening
the External Affairs and Defence Com-
mittee of Cabinet which deals with the
sensitive touchy questions vital to Aus-
tralia’s future security, and whose re-
ports are the basis upon which Cabinet
makes its decision.
As well as the Ministers you would
expect to be formally associated with
such a committee—Holt himself, John
McEwen in his capacity as Deputy Prime
Minister; the Treasurer, Mr McMahon;
the External Affairs Minister, Mr Has-
luck; and the Minister for Defence, Mr
Fairhall—Holt also pulled in the PMG,
Mr Hulme, and the Minister for Works,
Senator Gorton. There might have been
a basis of politics in Hulme’s appoint-
ment. Queensland, and the electoral re-
sults there, is important to the Holt
Government. It would have probably
been bad politics to give any basis for a
suggestion that Hulme the senior
Queensland Minister had been slighted
by the allocation of the Defence port-
folio to the New South Welshman Fair-
hall.
But there certainly was no politics in
putting in Gorton. Gorton has person-
ality qualities that may not endear him
to those Liberal senators who, suffering
under an inferiority complex as far as
their House of Representatives col-
leagues are concerned, try to act as
though they are detached from the day.
to-day struggle of party politics. Gorton
is tough and outspoken. He tells them
that they have party loyalties and he ex-
pects them to adhere to them.
Rut when it comes to sheer capacity
Gorton is quite outstanding. He has a
quick, hard mind and a capacity to face
up to situations as they are, not as he
would prefer them to be. He believes
in making firm decisions and implement-
ing them. Holt would probably have
liked also to have elevated the new
Minister for Labor, Les Bury, to the
committee. But he is just in the saddle.
He is not yet firmly entrenched in it.
And until he becomes entrenched he
cannot do just as he pleases. As it was
he jumped Bury over four Ministerial
colleagues Transport Minister Freeth,
Immigration Minister Opperman, the
new Civil Aviation Minister, Swartz, and
Attorney-General Snedden. His expla-
nation for this was interesting. He told
a GTV-9 interviewer who asked why he
had taken this action: “The power to
appoint includes the duty to disappoint.”
But putting Bury on this committee
might be going too far at this particular
time. A Prime Minister has to make
allowances for jealousies developing be-
tween individuals in his team, and the
wise Prime Minister always has to keep
his eye on the possible as well as the
desirable. Mr Holt has been around the
summit of power for a long time. But
the climate of power right at the summit
undoubtedly changes people. Holt is
now at the summit. It looks as though
the process of change has already
started.
ALAN REID
DEVELOPMENT
Opening the Gulf
The extent of Australia s rawness in handling its iron ore resources was held
up for all to see last week. Only two of the several parties involved stood to gain
Japanese steelmakers, the buying cartel who kept their heads when all about them
were losing theirs, and BHP, who came out quietly winning three points.
The first was the setback to Hammersley
Iron, BHP’s most likely steel-producing
competitor, the second was the raising
of hopes for a pause in the downward
trend of price for ore and, thirdly, it
gave time for this latecomer to the export
field to gain ground. During the Mel-
bourne showdown 35 thousand tons of
BHP ore was on the way to Japan as a
trial shipment from Yampi.
From an industrial aspect the Com-
monwealth’s refusal to sanction an export
contract was a hard blow to Hammersley,
who have been affected by unexpected
costs on their fantastically big and com-
plex ore-export project at Dampier and
Mount Tom Price. They say they
needed the sale to help pay for their £lB
million pellet plant. Mr Charles Court,
the State Minister for Industrial Develop'
ment, pointed out: “One of Japan's rea-
sons for buying ore from us was that
they considered Australia a stable coun-
try where contracts were honored. After


this experience they will have their
doubts.”
From a political aspect, the dispute
opened further the gulf between Perth
and Canberra Liberals at a time when
it was hoped the change of faces might
have brought a more sympathetic atti-
tude. Acknowledging the Common-
wealth’s right to save Australia from be-
coming a Japanese quarry, it is felt in
Perth that the export ban was handled
with the bumble-footedness of inexperi-
ence.
One instance was ill-informed com-
ments on Tasmania’s Savage River con-
tracts, and comparison between this and
Hammersley’s. When Mr Court first
pointed out that Savage River pellet sales
had been approved at a lower price than
the rejected West Australian contract,
National Development Minister Fair-
bairn replied that Mr Court would have
no access to details of the contract . . .
at a time when the West Australian Min-
ister — a chartered accountant —had a
copy of the contract in his briefcase. In
announcing the Commonwealth stand,
Mr Fairbairn said: “We have already
accorded to the Japanese an equitable
share of the economic advantage of our
geographical proximity.” And he used a
similar style of English when he de-
scribed the two sides of the Savage
agreement: “One half is being financed
from American and some Australian
sources and the other from Japanese
sources. With regard to these pellets we
have recognised that any profits which
might be realised on their disposal would
(after tax) be expected to be remitted,
in any case, to Japan. We will, therefore,
allow the transfer of this half of the
pellets on export at a calculated cost of
production, subject to the company enter-
ing into an arrangement to ensure the
payment of Commonwealth taxes, cal-
culated as if a fair market price had been
paid for these pellets.” In other words,
half the Savage River production is being
sold at a fair market price the other half
at cost but with Commonwealth taxes
being paid as if it were higher.
The market price for the first two years
will be 20 cents per unit (20 American
cents per 1 per cent of iron per ton of
pellets), for the next three years 19 cents,
the next three 18.5 cents, and after that
the average of the prices obtained in
Japan for pellets from all non-Communist
countries. The rejected Hammersley con-
tract was worth 18 cents per unit, and
for pellets with a lower iron content.
Basically the Americans, Pickands
Mather, are in the Savage because they
make their money managing and oper-
ating mines. (The promised 20 per cent
Australian equity is still at the negoti-
ating stage with three companies and an
announcement is expected in about a
month.) Half the ore in the ground be-
longs to the Japanese, paid for by the
44 million American dollars they have
in the project,
While costs must be calculated in the
light of this non-earning investment and
their non-profitmaking ore, the cost
price would still not be high. Mr Fair-
bairn said the return to Australian pro-
ducers on past contracts was between 14
and 15 cents per unit. Averaging out the
20 to 18.5 cents on one half, and cost
price on the rest, is a value judgment
but the company who were put out
by some of last week’s estimates do
not quibble with Mr Court's estimate of
17 cents. After the first eight years of
the 20-year contract this will reduce
further. And already it is considerably
lower than the rejected Hammersley
price.
RSPCA
Gentle Whips
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has taken up a new
cause, and since there is no group in Australia strong enough to withstand the RSPCA,
it is, as they say in racing, “London to a brick” that it will succeed.
For some months now the RSPCA has
been putting pressure on Australia’s
leading racing clubs to exercise stricter
supervision over jockeys’ use of whips.
Eventually the society hopes to see the
afternoon when whips are banned com-
pletely from racetracks. At the moment,
however, it is pursuing the limited tac-
tical objective of ensuring that jockeys
use their whips in a more gentle manner.
The Victoria Racing Club, parent
body of the State’s race clubs, for some
time has been quietly warning its more
punishing riders that they must not
strike their mounts with undue severity,
and must hit them in orthodox places.
In October the stewards took more overt
action and fined leading jockey Jim
Johnson, the hardest-hitting little man
since the days of the great Darby Munro
and Harold Badger, £lO for excessive
use of the whip on the two-year-old
Royal Scot. Royal Scot was having its
first start and ran third. Johnson claimed
that he was acting under the instructions
of tariner Tony lopes, who described
the gelding as “a lazy type of horse”.
Two months later Johnson was called
before the stewards again because of
his use of the whip on Gheracian, a
plodding type of horse which he rode
into eighth place in a moderate field at
Moonee Valley. The stewards explained
that he had not, in their opinion, used
the whip to excess, but that “his manner
of application was very displeasing”.
fn a tight finish Johnson is inclined to
rise high in the saddle and clout his
mount home with a windmill kind of
action in which he strikes' both the front
and rear quarters. This style of riding is
most ungainly and also most successful.
The public is tolerant and appreciates
that not all good things come in pretty

packages, especially when Johnson is
astride a favorite. Johnson was instructed
by the stewards that he was not to use
the whip in a forehand manner in front
of the saddle. What they really meant
was that he was not to attempt to strike
his mounts on the neck, or over the head,
a couple of devices which some jockeys
had been using with a high rate of suc-
cess in close contests. Apart from
assisting horses to (as racing parlance
has it) “do their best”, such blows make
them stick their necks out, which is
handy in a photo-finish. They also hurt
the horse quite a lot, and can inflict in-
jury.
A couple of days later Johnson was
again fined £lO for disobeying instruc-
tions in his use of the whip in the Bagot
Handicap, the New Year’s Day feature
event at Flemington. But some followers
of the fancy rallied to the jockey’s flank
and asserted that he was being victim-
ised for “doing his best”. A case that
the stewards hoped could be closed
quietly suddenly bolted away from their
control when allegations were made that
the vice-chairman of the VRC, Mr
Trevor Clarke, had called Johnson a
“lion tamer”, had suggested to the stew-
ards that they punish Johnson, and had
told the jockey that he was riding for
a fall.
Top racing officials were much put out
by these charges and the stewards were
forced to cancel their instruction to
Johnson pending a full inquiry. The
RSPCA kept the inside running however,
and told the VRC that unless action was
taken to restrict the use of the whip it
would ask to see certain racing films
in the presence of top racing officials.
The films show jockeys hitting horses
on the head in tight finishes. The society
also focused its glasses on Sydney and
last week announced that it was seek-
ing legal advice on whether it could take
action against jockey Des Lake.
Lake drove his mount, Aureo, to vic-
tory at Rosehill on January 15. When
the horse returned to scale its rump was
lined with whip welts. Lake has been
since suspended over another matter
and will not ride in Australia for a long
time; he is going to Ireland, but the
Australian Jockey Club has received
the message and has announced that it
will make new regulations about the use
of whips shortly.
The 12-man VRC committee has now
given stewards the power to punish joc-
keys for excessive use of whips or spurs,
and for hitting a horse on or near the
head with the whip (the spurs by the
way are dummies and have no spike
rowels). Punters at the following Sat-
urday’s meeting at Melbourne’s new San-
down race track took the opportunity to
use a fresh excuse to explain the failures
of their elect. After each event contro-
vwsy raged over the possibility erf a
different result if only Johnson and com-
pany had not been restrained in laying
on the whip.
At the Easter meeting of Australian
race clubs the VRC is certain to raise
the whole question of whips and to press
for uniform rules restricting their use.
A silent, spectral member of the meeting
will be the RSPCA which will be anxious
to press for further concessions. The
society will not be happy until whips are
banned altogether but it must face the
practical problem that whips are neces-
sary to stop horses lugging in, shifting
out, and stopping suddenly when the
pressure is on; habits which can be
dangerous and cause serious falls. The
smarties are laying attractive odds that
the society can win the big one too

BRIAN BUCKLEY
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
Playford’s Guerrilla Band
After a decent Christmas cessation of hostilities the tough and sometimes dirtv
Parliamentary war is on again in South Australia. }
Sir Thomas Playford’s guerrilla band
has one big advantage, apart from its
superior knowledge of the terrain: the
South Australian Legislative Assembly
has only 39 members and it has never
bothered to introduce time limits for
speeches or timetables for the completion
of various stages of legislation. During
its 32 years of rather polite opposition
the ALP was never adventurous or cun-
ning enough to exploit this circumstance,
but now that it occupies the Treasury
benches Labor finds itself subjected to
the grand old American tactic of fili-
bustering.
Last session Liberal-Country League
members spent so much time in windy
speeches during the address-in-reply
debate, the loan estimate debate, the
debates on supplementary estimates and
on grievance motions that the Govern-
ment was sorely pressed to push through
more than a couple of major pieces of
legislation. Frequently the active and
crafty Sir Thomas kept pressing the
Government until the early hours of the
morning, and one session lasted 22 hours.
Some Ministers privately admitted that
they finished the session in a state of
exhaustion.
Playford feels that the Government is
vulnerable to attack over its Succession
Duties Bill, which has aroused wide-
spread opposition from the LCL, the
papers and the Chamber of Commerce.
The bill does nothing that was not done
years ago in other States, but it is gener-
ally misunderstood and its opponents
have suggested that it is unfair to
widows. In fact all the bill does is lighten
the burden of death duties on estates of
£19,000 or less, and increase them on
those over that figure.
The most interesting battle will centre
around the Government’s attempt to
bring in electoral reform. Walsh is out-
voted 16 to 4 in the Legislative Council
and there is no satisfactory constitutional

APOLOGY
TN its issue dated October 23, 1965,
“The Bulletin” published an article
under the heading “Breaking from
Constantinople” relating to the Greek
Orthodox Community of New South
Wales.
Mr Kikis Efthimiou of Sydney (a
member of the Council of the Greek
Orthodox Community of New South
Wales) has complained that this article
meant that he is a communist and a
criminal. \
“The Bulletin” never intended that
any such inference be drawn or to
reflect in any way upon Mr Efthi-
miou’s integrity. If any persons have
read the article in this sense, “The
Bulletin” much regrets that this should
have happened, and states that any
such suggestion concerning Mr Efthi-
miou is entirely incorrect and without
foundation.
“The Bulletin” also states that Mr
Efthimious is neither a communist nor
a criminal but stands as a person of
high repute in the community. We
apologise to Mr Efthimiou for any
hurt he has suffered as the result of
the publication of the story.
POLICE
Detect or
Instigate
For the zealous police officer where
does detection end, and where does to*
stigation start?
In Perth last week a magistrate, Mr
A. G. Smith, fined nightclub owner Cor-
nelius Hermans £lO for having give n
Constable Robert E. Mawson and h' s
wife, who was expecting twins, a bottle
of beer with which to drink the babies
health. The court was told that the con-
stable, who was off-duty at the time, and


his wife were having a meal at Her-
mans’ club. The constable asked for a
bottle of beer because his wife was ex-
pecting twins. Later, after having re-
fused to sell them liquor, Hermans of-
fered them a bottle of beer, free of
charge.
The magistrate asked: “If you go to
someone’s place and he gives you a glass
°f beer, is he supplying you with liquor?
fs this an offence within the Act?” How-
ler, after a quick check with a copy
of the Licensing Act this was found to
he true in the case of eating-houses.
West Australian legal experts have
condemned the methods used by Con-
stable Mawson to obtain the conviction.
Ooe QC said: “This case is scandalous
“ligation at gutter-level. The matter
should be brought directly to the attention
of the Commissioner of Police”.
A colleague said he had heard of a
number of cases of questionable be-
havior by Liquor Branch policemen,
but this was the worst to come to his
notice.
Mr Hermans told Pressmen later that
he considered he got a “lousy deal”. He
had given the constable the beer in good
faith and never knew, or thought, he was
breaking the law. He said he was a tee-
totaller and had come to Western Aus-
tralia from Holland 15 years ago. At
present he has an application for natu-
ralisation, but is doubtful whether to
go on with this. “It is ridiculous trying
to make a living under rules like this. The
police caught me on a law which was
made in 1911 because they could not
catch me out any other way.”
Reader of Law at the WA University,
Dr Eric Edwards, believes it is desirable
that criminals should be brought to
justice, and there is nothing wrong with
setting traps for those suspected of cri-
minal conduct. The distinction, however,
should be drawn between detection and
instigation. Dr Edwards says police
should not actively encourage offences
merely to charge the offender. It hardly
did credit to the police force, he said,
when they used subterfuges of this
kind. i
Meanwhile, the State Police Commis-
sioner, Mr R. T. Napier, has called for
a report on the case.

Of Pomp and Circumstance
The Queen , but not the Snowdons...
From ALEXANDER FRATER in London
The other day I flew back to London
from a Swiss winter holiday. As
the silver Caravelle leapt into the
air and bellowed away across the snow-
dappled pines, I controlled the routine
panic in my gut and glanced at the
stranger seated beside me. He caught
my eye and nodded gravely. “British?”
he said, in thick Zuricher accent. I
nodded.
“I am in ink,” he said, by way of
introduction.
“Lovely,” I whispered, as the jet ham-
mered through a rogue air pocket. At
3000 feet, when seat belts had been un-
buckled and fags lit, he turned to me
again. “1 am very interested in you
British,” he said. “In the way your
minds work. I hope you will not ob-
ject if I a personal question ask you?"
“Go ahead,” I said, breaking an in-
fallible rule.
“Would you,” he said, “die for the
Queen?”
“Which particular Queen would that
be?” I asked, uneasily.
Rushtons Monarchists
I am as loyal as the next man—in this
particular instance my good lady, who is
a keen supporter of the monarchy and all
it stands for My wife has taught me to
share her fanatical enthusiasm for the glitter
and the ceremonial to the full Indeed I
am frequently obliged to wave a Union
Jack and to shout “Good on you, Liz” as
she bicycles around the day-lounge graciously
acknowledging my cheers. Last year when
she had trouble with her varicose veins she
insisted I put hourly bulletins on the gate-
post. We fly a standard, designed and
knitted by her mother, when we are in
residence We have 16 Corgis and I am
forced to walk everywhere two paces be-
hind my good wife with my hands clasped
behind my back. Quite frankly. I’m getting
sick of the whole bloody business.
“Queen Elizabeth,” he answered, with
a trace of asperity. “Your Queen.”
I had never thought about it before,
but I did then, and reached my decision
in three seconds flat. “I’m afraid not,”
I said. But to ease the shock In his face
I added lightly: “I’d die for the Duchess
of Gloucester, though. What about you?”
He looked at me. “I would die for
Peter O’Toole,” he said, with quiet pas-
sion.
“Christ,” I muttered, and we left it
at that. But all the way across Central
France the question haunted me: If 1
wouldn’t die for the Queen, would 1 die
for the principle of monarchy? And if
I wouldn't, how many would? As the
air brakes thumped on over the hop-
fields of Kent I determined, once on the
ground, to put the query to a dozen
friends—selected on the basis of a cool
and balanced attitude to life. They auto-
matically split themselves into two
camps. The under-40s were definite and
unequivocal: negative. They claimed
they would die for. their families, and
for the preservation of democracy in
Britain, but they felt unable to accept
the Queen as an integral part of the
latter. The over-40s, however, were
undecided. Only one came straight out
and said he would, and he was unable
to say w'nv The others supposed they
might, but they preferred to defer their
decision till the occasion rose.
This spot test, carried out with a
casualness that would make the profes-
sional pollster eat his clip-board may
reflect nothing at all. but I have a hunch
it represents the feelings of a pretty fair
cross-section. Public attitudes to the
monarchy are currently in a state of
flux: some regard the Queen with a love
that verges on adoration, others see her
as a middle-aged German woman who
lives up The Mall. Between the two, the
intellectuals scoff at her middle-brow
tastes —Kathy Kirby, Goodwood and the
Crazy Gang. But all, I think, would
agree that the trappings of royalty, the
pomp, diadems and orbs, provide an
effective national stabiliser in times of
trouble and also—no less significant—
serve to channel the glamor away from
the actual Government who can get on
with the job of running the country.
Cases of megalomania, and the dreams
of glory that go with it, are a rarity
among British politicians.
The tide of criticism, however, like
the Thames, rolls ever on: even the Press
have been waspish, though in Fleet Street
anti-Queen sentiments are normally
taboo. She is still protected by that
old mystique, but the protection no
longer extends to other members of the
royal family. When Prince Philip, f or
example, described “The Daily Express”
as “a bloody awful newspaper”, he could
hardly expect the “Express” management
to continue referring to him with awed
deference. There was also a marked
coolness in the Press towards the Snow-
dons’ recent tour of the United States
partly because a number of papers
resented the amount of money the tax-
payer was forking out to provide the
couple with their fun, and partly be-
cause they don’t always conduct them-
selves like royalty anyway. There is,
of course, no particular reason why
they should conduct themselves like
royalty. Not like the traditional, dig-
nified, empire-building sort of royalty,
anyw'ay. But if the Queen’s sister and
brother-in-law choose to go stomping
Well, the question I ask myself as an
Australian intellectual, and as an Australian
intellectual I am constantly FORCED to
question myself, as, if I question anyone
else, they usually say, "Slope off, you boring
Australian intellectual with your fatuous
questions” — the question I ask is "Why?”
Now this cannot be answered with a simple
"Yes” or “No”, which suits me admirably
as I’ve nothing else to do today. Is the
Queen relevant to the ’sixties? Is she trendy?
Is she with it? Why not someone geared
to the times we live in? Why not the
Shrimp? Why not Googie Withers in op
art robes? Why not a man, darling?
Someone from David Bailey’s Box of Pin-
ups? I mean Australia is a man’s country
isn’t it? Shall we dance?

with The Rolling Stones at the Ad Lib,
and if Snowdon agrees to appear in
the most nauseating publishing event of
the year —David Bailey’s Box of Pin-
upS —along with P. J. Proby, smirking
and semi-nude, pretending to be Christ
on the cross, then they can no longer
expect an adoring public to pull their
forelocks as the royal Mini-Cooper
drives by.
Nevertheless, the carping of the Press
(and the MPs who tabled questions in
the House) over the cost of the Ameri-
can trip was completely unjustified.
The royal family is a luxury that the
country has chosen—without being actu-
ally asked —to keep. And if they want
it, then they can pay for it, and pay they
do. Two million pounds a year, in fact,
though the Queen’s official salary is
a mere £60,000. There are a number
of expenses, however, which she is ex-
pected to pay herself—£3ooo per annum
for horse fodder, £99 to the poet laur-
eate each year, and £3 to each set of
triplets born in the land.
And what of the future? In this age
of meritocracy it is fashionable to say
that the Crown’s grandeur and influ-
ence will decline till it parallels the
folksy, ineffective stature of certain
European monarchs. But the future
status of the British Crown will depend
entirely on one factor: the strength and
personality of the man who wears it.
The next person scheduled to shoulder
that awful responsibility is a shy, pleas-
ant youth who, like millions of his con-
temporaries, is mad about The Beatles.
There has been a comparatively mild
reaction in this country to his parents’
decision to send him to Timbertop. The
main voiced objection is that the school
chosen for him in Australia is just as
rigid and spartan as Gordonstoun. Popu-
lar sentiment seems to feel he should
have been given a spell in a place which
didn’t emphasise survival as one of the
high spots of its curriculum.
One notices a lot of public sympathy
for -The boy. Due to an accident of
birth, and through no action or ambi-
tion of his own, he is big news: as a
consequence he is being watched, judged
and evaluated by a curious world
right through the complex and self-
conscious period of adolescence. I feel
appalled at the tension he must have
felt when he trod the boards as Othello
in his school play. A routine enough
procedure for any other schoolboy, but
the future King of England must have
known that a boobed line, a clumsy
speech, would have set the whole world
grinning and nudging.
I remember when I was in the Old
Country for a visit to my wife’s people.
I was standing in The Malf in London,
gazing through tear-filled eyes at the home
of our stately Queen, when I was aware of
a face at an upper window of the palace.
I drew Gladene’s attention to it, and re-
moved my hat as a mark of respect. My
good lady began to jump up and down
excitedly and to sing “God help the
Queen”. In a moment our fellow-members
of the coach party had joined us and were
cheering whole-heartedly. It was during
this emotional scene that I perceived that
it was not the royal person, but a horse,
obviously one of the regal pets. However,
I did not draw anyone’s attention to this
fact as I reckoned it might have spoilt their
day.
The English Press has been reason-
ably merciful with his private life, but
the Continental journals have fastened
on to him like leeches. The editor of
the Swiss newspaper, for example, which
recently breathlessly announced that
Charles was being sent to Australia be-
cause he was interested in the daughter
of a Scottish merchant, deserves a kick
in the teeth from the biggest boot in the
federation. The truth of the story is
irrelevant: the plain fact of the matter
is that it was none of his business. At
that age I was pretty interested in girls
myself, and so were most of the other
people I knew. The Prince of Wales
isn’t a robot.
Currently there is not, in this country,
an enormous amount of enthusiasm at
the prospect of Charles becoming King
(we are waiting, unconsciously and per-
haps unfairly, for him to startle us) but
17 is a very early age to start earning
a nation’s allegiance. When he does
mount the throne, provided he shows his
subjects he means business, he will have
their support. The British are condi-
tioned that way. In the meantime, the
nicest thing Australia can do in the
months he is with us is simply leave
him alone and let him get on with the
few short years of comparative privacy
left to him.

Hipsters, Therapists and Squares
The Australian Republicans
By PETER COLEMAN
I recently had the bizarre experience of contributing a chapter to Geoffrey Dutton’s forthcoming
symposium on the monarchy and republicanism in Australia. It was bizarre because I had agreed to
discuss the “arguments” for republicanism in Australia.
There is no doubt that there is plenty
of republican—and monarchist —senti-
ment about, but arguments. . . ! Gener-
ally speaking, it seemed to me, after I
tracked them down, that most of the argu-
ments for republicanism are as miserable
as most of the arguments for monarchy;
and that in any case, as they soon are
sorted out, there is so little dividing the
more rational members of both camps
that the whole thing became a non-
issue, a phoney debate. Most sensible
people would be justified in referring to
the improbability in the near future of the
electorate changing Section 128 of the
Constitution and turning to more prac-
tical problems. Republicanism, in other
words, can wait. But that does not make
it any easier to debate the issue now in
a symposium.
Nevertheless, if we leave aside the
fairly widespread tacit republican senti-
ment in Australia and consider only the
more or less articulate republicans, there
seems to me to be three main types.
They can be labelled, for the purposes of
discussion, the Hipsters, the Shock
Therapists and the Squares.
The Hip Republicans need not detain
us long. Their main organs in Aus-
tralia are the satirical magazines, not-
ably “Oz” which, according to one of its
editors, is bought by “hip people aged
between 18 and 30”, has between 30,000
and 40,000 readers, and is committed to
republicanism. It delights in lampooning
the Queen (who provides an immense
amount of material for satire) in the
same way as it lampoons the RSL, sub-
urbia, democracy, the Press. Its writers
despise the monarchy not because it is
oppressive or dangerous but because
they believe it is popular, and what is
popular must be loathsome. They are
really descendants of the old colonial
imperialists and despise Australians
in the same spirit. (“An Australian?”
says Sir William Langton with con-
tempt, in Martin Boyd's “Card-
board Crown”. “What’s that? A con-
vict? A gold-digger?” “An Austra-
lian?” says “Oz”, “What’s that? A
drunken Digger? A suburban Mum?”)
But I said they need not detain us long
because it is obvious that, if Australia
became a republic, they would lampoon
it with even more relish than they lam-
poon the monarchy. The republic would
simply be the old Australia with a
president instead of a Queen. They are
not in fact republicans; they simply use
republicanism as one stick with which
to beat the Australians and their way of
life. Or at best they are a sub-intellectual
version of the second type the
Shock Therapists. \
The Shock Therapist republicans say
they do not want to attack ordinary
Australian life but rather to shake up
the elite which they claim is not giving
Australia the leadership it needs. The
elite, on this view, is so corrupted by
its British-mindedness or its imperial
nostalgia that it will not confront Aus-
tralia’s problems, especially its industrial,
international and defence problems. It
prefers to whistle “There’ll Always Be
An England” and chase British honors,
while Australia sinks. Therefore, at all
costs and no matter what the temporary
public indifference, the republican issue
must be pushed to a head in order to
shake the elite out of its rut. The most
outspoken of these Shock Therapists is
Donald Horne. “Australia,” he says in
“The Lucky Country”, which is the classic
text of this sort of republicanism, “needs
sudden shocks of reorientation within its
society that will divorce it from the
largely irrelevant problems of the British,
make it possible to speed necessary
changes and to develop some new sense
of identity . . . and act at times as if
Larry of “Punch” on Australia
it were so.” The sooner we get a re-
public, the sooner we abolish all the
nonsense of the honors system, royal
visits, British nostalgia, the greater will
be our chances of survival.
Horne goes further than this. The
monarchy, he believes, glamorises our
stuffy conservatism, our failure to link
ourselves with Asian countries, our
failure to develop the North, our failure
to develop our technology. If we were
a republic these failures would scream
out for correction, but the monarchy
casts a spell of historical sureness over
our way of life, so that, like eternal
batsmen, we imagine we can go on strol-
ling out to the crease, when in fact we
are probably going to fall on our faces
and be trampled to death. The mon-
archy is, in other words, a positively
dangerous influence w'hich must be ter-
minated urgently. Since Horne takes
the monarchy seriously-—more seriously
than some monarchists—his criticisms
are more searching than are those of
most republicans and more worth detailed
consideration. In the end, however, it
seems to me his case in “The Lucky
Country” boils down to a more sophis-
ticated version of the “Oz” contempt for
Australians, despite his protestations to
the contrary. (There is, of course, no-
thing immoral about an attitude of con-
tempt for ordinary people or ordinary
human nature; it may be based on a
theological truth, but it rules out all
political solutions, including republican-
ism, as trivial.)
To begin with the crucial question of
influence. Horne rightly does not labor
this point. No one can seriously say
(though some old-fashioned super-con-
spiratorial people try to) that our de-
cisions are still London-centred. We are
in Vietnam for example, the British are
not; we do not recognise Red China, the
British do. Even if the issue is ex-
pressed in terms of a pervasive, nostal-
gic influence rather than a specific one,
no one offers any significant evidence of
how this operates against the national
interest —given the American alliance,
for example, or for that matter the posi-
tive, irreplaceable value to Australia of
the British alliance in South-East Asia.
It would be slightly—but only slightly—
more plausible to talk of “sinister”
American rather than British influence,

but the republican, obsessed with Britain,
remains a few decades out of date.
But Horne’s argument is less concerned
with British influence on national de-
cisions than on our lack of decisions:
the monarchy, he believes, glamorises our
indecisiveness, our failure to meet urgent
problems —of defence, immigration,
foreign policy, northern development.
This cannot be taken seriously either.
Obviously, our performance in these
fields can be dismissed, attacked, derided
or whatever, but who could seriously say
that the Australian people or their
leaders have cultivated the affluent Sweet
Life (to put the point at its strongest)
instead o,f pursuing more heroic tasks,
because of the monarchy? The fault,
if this is one, lies in democracy, not
monarchy.
Sense of identity
IJHhich brings us to Horne’s real point.
I do not think he seriously be-
lieves the monarchic influence on our
national decisions or lack of them is
significant, let alone dangerous; but the
monarchy is one of the established
pieties, and any onslaught on that must
have a good effect by shaking things up
and making new directions of policy
possible. Horne in other words is really
less concerned with attacking the mon-
archy as with finding a way of injecting
a sense of crisis into Australian life.
Although he blames the elite for Aus-
tralia’s shortcomings and defends the
Australian people against the usual
middle-brow charges of mediocrity, in
fact the Australians seem to dismay him
as much as they do the “Oz” boys or
the old imperialists. He wants a new
elite who will deliver a “shock of re-
orientation” to the people and a “new
sense of identity”, and he wants this in
a hurry.
Does Australia urgently need a new
sense of identity? If we were talking
about, say, political parties and not
countries, there are obviously circum-
stances when a national split, a new
beginning, are inevitable or desirable.
The classic case in recent years was the
Labor Party split. But Australia is not a
political party, and are our problems so
great that the divisions between Aus-
tralians, between nationalists and “mon-
archists”, should be made as bitter and
deep as those between Left and Right
wings of the Labor Party in the 1950s—
for the sake of a supposed national re-
generation, a new identity!
Taking Horne’s view as seriously as
he does himself, aggressive shock-thera-
pist republicans, out to give us a new
identity, must, presumably, in the
national interest, awaken and sharpen
the differences between Australians and
push them to a crisis. Since we are
dealing with a democracy that has
universal suffrage and not with a de-
bating club, and since British influence
must be presented as dangerous and
then destroyed urgently, republicans
cannot simply allow republican sentiment
to grow gradually but will have to
launch a movement, strong enough to
win a referendum, by developing not
popular loathing of a precise enemy or
an oppressive foreign power, such as the
American colonists or Indian national-
ists faced, but of vague, diffuse in-
fluences. Since fundamental popular
changes can only be brought about by
dramatisation and demagoguery (and no
one objects to this in a good cause), it
can only mean cultivating hostility to
harmless British influences which have
bitten deep into the country’s unfortunate
“sense of identity”, to “British” institu-
tions which in origin means most of our
institutions from political parties to
law courts and churches and to a
mass of people for whom their British-
ness means a lot. It means dividing
people into “monarchists” and “republi-
cans”, people who otherwise live and
work together and who both love their
country. Is this not nonsense? Why on
earth divide Australians on an issue
which, compared with our mutual inter-
ests in defence against, for example,
Communism, is trivial for the sake of
creating a crisis which will lead us to
a new and better identity. On this view*
it is republicanism not the monarchy
which would be a dangerous influence.
But how far do the views of the Hip-
sters and the Shock Therapists really re-
flect the republican sentiments of that
“astonishing variety of people” whom
Geoffrey Dutton has said share his re-
publican sentiments. It seems to me that
they do not reflect them at all; and this
brings us to the third group the
Squares, the conservative nationalists.
Compared with the Hipsters and Shock
Therapists, they are a very dull and
unimaginative lot, but they are, I think,
the only genuine republicans, and their
numbers will certainly increase. They can
reasonably be called the New Republi-
cans if so pretentious a label is suit-
able for such unpretentious people.

because it is his sense of identity and
his determination to preserve it that
makes him a republican. He recognises
without rancor that many of his country-
men are pro-British and even pro-mon-
archy. He knows his country developed
under the monarchy and he feels no
great sense of alienation from or shame
of his past. What would shame him
would be being forced to renounce it.
He is basically not so much a republican
as a patriot who believes that a republic
is probably a next step in the growth
of the sense of identity he wants to pre-
serve. But believing in growth and being
confident in his country’s capacity for
growth he is in no great hurry. He gives
his support more readily to Lord Casey
than to the Queen, but he is a republican
because he simply believes that no
amount of legalism can remove the fact
that the Queen is not an Australian, is
not his Queen, and he would prefer an
Australian head of state.
Unlike the monarchists he believes that
our free institutions are in no way de-
pendent on the monarchy or on formal
British connections. But he feels no
need to force the break dramatically be-
cause he sees every day that things are
developing in the direction he wants.
When even the most conservative, anglo-
phile institutions such as the High Court
or the Anglican Church take what in this
context have to be called “nationalist”
lines —Sir Owen Dixon’s rejection of the
House of Lords decisions and Bishop
Shevill’s attack on “imported” Church
leaders, for example—only a blind dog-
matist can pretend there is any crisis or
need for one on this matter —especially
given the strength of popular national-
ism.
Potty Queen-worship
JguT —and this is the point—since he
feels no sense of urgency about it,
the Square feels more in common with
the monarchist than with the Hipster or
Shock Therapist republicans. For the
essence of monarchism is not potty
Queen-worship, despite a few examples
in high places, but the determination that
political change should be a matter of
growth, of development within national
traditions, which to date has included
the monarchy.
Who are the monarchists? There are
a few descendants of Sir William Lang-
ton and the old imperialists who despise
the pretensions of Australians; there are
those anglophiles who do not understand
that republicanism does not mean anglo-
phobia; there are a few who enjoy the
pageantry and ceremony associated with
monarchy and see no ready Australian
substitute. But most defenders of mon-
archy are simply conservatives who see
no present incompatibility between their
loyalty to Australia and their loyalty to
British traditions from which Australia
grew and which do not oppress us now.
They are not so mad as to oppose
change; they may agree that terrible
changes may soon be upon us, but they
claim the monarchy is an ideal way of
bridging change, or minimising the pain
and shame involved when dramatic
changes are forced on a country. It
may be that many of them have a
more urgent sense of a coming crisis
than the Shock Therapists. But they
also believe that wherever possible change
should be a matter of growth without
unnecessary crises or jiggery-pokery
about cultivating a new sense of identity.
If dramatic change is forced upon us
they would be frank enough to see this
as proof of our failure, not an occasion
for excitement. They are in other words
so very akin to the conservative repub-
lican that any dispute between them is
trivial. They will surely see to it that
the republican-monarchist debate does
not become a real issue—and remains a
phoney debate—until the decision that
will have to be made seems an obvious
and natural one, involving the minimum
of crisis. Otherwise, they will both have
failed.

The Dark Side of
World Affairs
When is anyone ready for independence?
By JUDITH RICH
Miss Era Bell Thompson, the inter-
national editor of “Ebony” maga-
zine, sat in yet another hotel room
—this time in Sydney and tried to
size up the position of this country’s
dark people. In her work for America’s
Negro pictorial magazine circulation,
900,000 the pattern has been repeat-
ed through five continents over the last
18 years.
She sipped squash in Lumumba’s house
on the day the Congo won independence
and, later in Uganda, watched the first
refugees come in from the Congo blood-
bath. “Many African nations gained in-
dependence that year 1960 80
million African people,” she said. “And
the same year I attended Liberia’s cele-
brations for their 113th year of independ-
ence. The newest and the oldest.”
She has been imprisoned in Johannes-
burg. “Technically it was because I had
no visa but primarily it was because of
the apartheid laws, which did
not allow me to stay in white
hotels,” Miss Thompson said.
“If I was ever going to be
frightened during my life, it
should have been then. But it
never occurred to me—l was
more angry than anything else.”
Miss Thompson has visited
Africa four times and in 1964
was editor of “Ebony Africa”,
sold in 12 English-speaking Afri-
can countries for six issues be-
fore it was discontinued. Her
first visit, in 1953 to write a second
book, “Africa, Land of My Father”
was marred by immigration difficulties.
“I wanted to write of a connecting link
between the African Negro and the
American Negro,” she explained. “But I
spent most of my time trying to get
through immigration formalities. I was
put under technical custody going into
Tanzania I only wanted to buy
some trinkets and I was persona
non grata in four countries. The first
time in South Africa they told me
to get out of town quickly. My book
ended up as the experiences of an
American Negro trying to go home.”
Of granting independence to African
nations, she says: “It is always too soon
for those people who are in control; not
soon enough for those people who are
not independent. When is a person
ready? There are differences in the de-
gree of preparation for independence
given by various African countries. In
some countries Africans are given
ERA BELL THOMPSON
responsible jobs in the civil service and
voting rights full training for indepen-
dence whereas other peoples are
given none. Unless steps have been taken
to prepare them, it is an injustice to say
they are not ready.”
When Miss Thompson interviewed Sir
Abubakar Tafawa Balewa in Nigeria,
just before independence, he was getting
ready to take up the Prime Minister-
ship. She recalled that he was very quiet
and reserved a hard man to inter-
view and there was no hint, in the
jubilance of the people, of the stirrings
which culminated in last month’s coup.
“It seems to be the order of the day,”
she said. “There are military coups all
over the world. I don’t know if it is a
disease. It is part of the growth of new
countries. We had civil war in our coun-
try. Weak young nations seem to need
one-party governments and strong lead-
ership to maintain stability. Violence?
There was violence in the Holy
Roman Empire.”
Speaking of the religious and
tribal differences which weaken
the African nations, Miss
Thompson said: “It is very
difficult to take self-contained
strong tribes like the Ash-
anti in the south of Ghana, for
instance and put them under
modern government. And
many of the colonial divisions
across tribal lines are to blame.
Much friction has occurred be-
cause of unrealistic divisions.”
Hie two most pressing problems
facing Negroes in the United States were
voting in the South and housing in the
North, Miss Thompson said. As a result
of improved voting methods Federal
marshals touring the South to ensure the
registering of Negro voters seven
Negroes now sit in the Georgia legis-
lature and Negroes hold office in city
councils in the South.
“I am very much heartened by Presi-
dent Johnson,” Miss Thompson said. “He
is carrying on Kennedy’s plans and
policies and doing a good job. But there
is still a long way to go. Housing patterns
in the North are responsible to a large
degree for segregation, but many cities
are pushing for open occupancy, so a
person can live wherever his money will
allow.”
Miss Thompson lives in an experimen-
tal inter-racial housing development out-

on a government slum clearance area,”
she explained. “The unique part is that
it is middle-class, high-rise housing.
Usually such schemes are only tried with
lower-class living. There is a long wait-
ing list for homes there.”
Miss Thompson met Negro Nobel
Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche in
the Congo and the Rev. Martin Luther
King is a regular visitor to “Ebony’s”
four US offices. Miss Thompson said she
thought the Black Muslims seemed to be
breaking up since the death of Malcolm
X. “The Black Muslims were in existence
for about 30 years in the US and nobody
paid any attention till they got publicity,”
she said. “The sect following grew
primarily because of publicity. Malcolm
X was a strangely magnetic personality.”
Miss Thompson will soon follow her
first book, “American Daughter”, with a
sequel autobiography, “American Daugh-
ter Abroad”. She will gather informa-
tion about Australia’s Aborigines and
the White Australia policy, during her
two months’ stay here.
Notes on Fixing
By JOHN THURSTON
A wet Sunday afternoon like so many
others in London, as we sprawl in
hard armchairs with the “posh
Sundays”. He is faintly restless, skim-
ming the pages, finally dropping the
paper to the floor beside him and gazing
into the gas fire. He stands up sud-
denly, goes to the rucksack that contains
all he owns, takes out a small parcel
wrapped in white cloth and unrolls it,
spreading the cloth on the bed. Methodi-
cally sets out his equipment on the cloth:
twist of silver paper, tea-spoon, eye-
dropper, needle from a small hypodermic
syringe, leather belt, box of matches.
Opens twist of silver paper: three white
tablets, very small, each one-sixth of a
grain of heroin (a small dose) at £1 per
grain. Goes into kitchenette with eye-
dropper and cleans it. Takes teaspoon
into kitchenette, emerges with small quan-
tity of water in it. Places one tablet In
the water, strikes a match and holds it
under the spoon. Passes his tongue
across his lips, eyes fixed on the tablet.
The water heats visibly without boiling,
but a second match completes the job:
the tablet dissolves and the water, still
clear, is drawn up into the eye-dropper.
All this with no hurry, no nervousness,
just a kind of detached care.
The top of the needle is fitted over the
mouth of the full eye-dropper; the im-
provised syringe is then laid back on the
cloth. He stands up now and takes the
belt: rolls up left sleeve, revealing two
circular scars, half-inch diameter, just
below the elbow joint, the result of fairly
regular “fixing'’. Passes the belt round his
bicep and through the buckle without
fastening it, remainder of the belt hang-
ing down his arm; takes the end of the


A Cantonese Opera. As unique as Hong Kong itself. A
symbol of the Orient as much as Hong Kong is “hub
of the Orient.” A complete contrast of sound, colour
and movement from the serenity of a
sampan riding on quiet waters. But this
is Hong Kong. This is the gateway to
the East, the only city in the world where
East truly meets West, where there is
complete co-existence of the old and the
new. Where the mysticism, of the Orient
comes face to face with the reality of the West. Hong
Kong, including Kowloon, the New Territories, and

vacation
the surrounding hundreds of tiny islands has a total
area of only 398 i square miles. Yet in this area abounds
some of the most breathtaking panoramic views in the
world. In complete contrast are the busi-
ness areas of Victoria and Kowloon, where
many goods may be purchased at prices
less than in their country of origin. So
for a holiday that’s different, take a
trip to Hong Kong. Take a Hong Kong
vacation. If you’re on business plan your
itinerary so that you can spend some time in Hong Kong,
the place that has everything. You’ll be glad you did.

belt in his left hand and jerks it a few
times, lacing it through his fingers to
keep the loop round his bicep tight.
Below the belt his arm darkens, the
veins standing out richly. A clear vein
is vital because he is “mainlining” (inject-
ing into the bloodstream), not just “joy-
popping” (gaining a brief, sharp but sup-
erficial “kick” by shooting into the skin).
He is still outwardly calm.
Holding the eye-dropper half-way
down, between thumb and index finger,
he begins to press the needle into his
arm. As it penetrates he stops breath-
ing; there is a sudden tension in the room.
A moment passes, but he can’t hit the
vein. He withdraws the needle and re-
laxes for a minute: “Out of practice; first
time I’ve fixed for two weeks.” The arm
is now rich red and has a slightly puffed
appearance.
He stands motionless for a few sec-
onds and the erratic hissing of the gas-
fire seems very loud. He brings the
needle towards his elbow-joint again, lips
pulled in over his teeth and pressed to-
gether. Needle into arm; a pause . . .
then a quick exhalation, “Aah!”, as a
vivid filament of blood curls into the
glass tube; slow, steady pressure on the
rubber bulb and both liquid and blood
disappear into the vein. He leaves the
needle in for a moment, then withdraws
it Flicks the belt loose and drops it
on the bed; there is a pinhead of blood
on his arm, but he brushes it away with
his hand and rolls down his sleeve. Any
sign of tension has disappeared; there is
no indication that anything has happened
to him.
Brief cleaning of his equipment, then
he wraps it carefully and puts it away.
He sits down again and gazes at the gas
fire, his breathing momentarily rapid and
shallow. Within a couple of minutes
he picks up his paper again, perhaps a
little more relaxed than before. Half an
hour later he speaks for the first time:
“Have to give it up soon; hate to get
hooked.”
WINE OF THE MONTH
Sweet and Dry
By CELLARMASTER
This begins a new series of Cellar-
master articles. In the first Bulletin
of each month he will announce his
selection of the Wine of the Month.
There is definitely a “thing” about
dry wines in Australia today. How
often do you hear the affected pro-
test: “Oh, I can’t stand that sort of
thing, it’s sweet!”, forever condemning it
to some obscure outer suburban category.
After all, the most complex table wine in
the world, Chateau Y’Quem, is probably
the sweetest.
Yet an interesting development
is the recent inclusion in wine show
schedules of a new class called
Medium Dry White. This concerns
a type of wine popular in Australia
named Moselle, often sweeter
than the overseas counterpart
from the Mosel area of Germany.
Lindemans have recently produced a
wine of this pattern, and it becomes—
—flourish of trumpets—-the first Cellar-
master Wine of the Month.
It is Lindemans Reserve Bin Spatlese
Moselle, Bin 2828, Vintage 1965. The
Spatlese means, of course, late picking,
therefore maximum grape sugar in rela-
tion to water content, therefore a touch
of sweetness and a rich, full flavor. The
wine was made in the Clare district of
SA from Rhine Riesling grapes, has a
full character with a very strong fruity
bigness and, though soft, it still retains
a typical Rhine Riesling character. Has
only been exhibited so far in one Show,
Adelaide, 1965, where it took a Gold
Medal in the medium dry white class
1965 and a Silver Medal in the medium
dry white open class. There is no
guarantee that this kind of wine can
be produced every year. You need a
long, sunny ripening period until the
grapes are picked very late, and if it
gets cool they don’t ripen sufficiently
and you miss out. Further south in the
same area Orlando produce their famous
Spatlese, again from Rhine Ries-
ling grapes, which is sweeter still.
I applaud these wines of quality.
This extended grape character
can produce different styles. If
you pick Rhine Riesling late you
can get this lovely, rich, full quality
but still with Riesling char-
acter. But if you late-pick Semillon
grapes in the Hunter Valley you get a
straight sauterne. Elsewhere, Semillon
can be too acid.
I personally prefer these wines served
with dessert and the best dessert I know
is chilled fresh fruit. Luscious mangoes,
Victorian plums and Shanghai peaches
are in at the moment and chilled are
superb eating with a tall glass of Spat-
lese served alongside.

Malaysia’s Next PM
The Tun is no Sukarno
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
“The indispensable deputy to the indis-
pensable leader.”
"Malaysia’s Eden to Tunku’s Churchill”
“The most hard-working and hard-
worked of Alliance Ministers.”
“As different and as unimpressive as
Shastri once appeared to be until
he obtained supreme power.”
“A machine politician with no heart.”
“He has the qualities of a top civil
servant but these are not necessarily-
those of a national political leader.”
rpHESE are but a few of the phrases to
be heard about the next Prime Min-
ister of Malaysia, its present Deputy
Prime Minister, Minister for Defence,
Minister for Rural and National Develop-
ment, de facto Assistant Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, Vice-President of UMNO
as long as the Tunku has been President,
in short, the general
factotum of the Alli-
ance Government,
Tun Abdul Razak
bin Dajo Hussein.
Already with the
Tunku’s eyesight not
at its best (he needs
an operation, but has
postponed undergo-
ing it either in UK or
Japan) it is the Tun
who shifts most of
the files. But, it is
frequently asked, is
Razak better as a
number two than he
will be as a number
one? Having been
so long in the great
man’s shadow, will
he, when he finally
emerges, be seen to
have become a shadow himself?
Unhappily he still gives the appearance
of being an ambiguous figure. He simply
doesn’t project. Inevitably but un-
fairly he is compared with the Tunku
who is seen as egregious, gregarious,
effusive, jovial, commanding. Irrelevant
though the comparison may be, Razak
appears subordinate, reticent, solitary,
non-committal, serious and diffident. The
Tunku is believed to be concerned with
the compromises that proceed from
liking people, Razak with he hard
decisions that beget efficient organisa-
tion. The Tunku is loved, Razak respect-
ed. The Prime Minister is warm and
blown, Razak cold and distant.
Tunku’s capacity for the tough or
ruthless decision, the fact of his royalty
TUN ABDUL RAZAK
which one forgets too easily to one’s
cost these and other aspects are con-
cealed. Consequently it is all too easily
assumed that Razak will fail because of
this adverse comparison just as it was
wrongly assumed that Shastri would fail
after Nehru.
T>ut what, rather than who, will come
after the Tunku is the prior question.
And this boils down to communal in-
tegration and economic growth.
- As elsewhere, Malayan, and then
Malaysian, independence was obtained
by a monolithic party which further con-
solidated its power with subsequent
victories at the polls. Will the Alliance
(comprising Malays, Chinese and
Indians) disintegrate, as it shows some
signs of doing? Or, .like the Indian Nat-’
ional Congress, survive to dominate the
second decade of in-
dependence? The
Alliance has never
been the grass-root
mass movement that
characterised, and
still sustains, the In-
dian National Con-
gress. It is (and
Razak will be) as
strong as its weakest
link, the Malayan
Chinese Association,
which decreasingly
appeals to Chinese
self-interest and cer-
tainly has no substan-
tial political machine.
Economically, Ma-
laya is also a rarity,
in that the momen-
tum gained in the col-
onial era has been
sustained and en-
hanced during the first decade of inde-
pendence. The economic structure has
remained virtually the same; demands to
change to a different, say socialist, frame-
work have been minimal. Foreign, mainly
British, firms and the Chinese business-
men have done most of the sustaining and
a good deal of the benefiting. Government
developmental expenditures have in-
creased but for the most part not in ways
to alter this pattern. Special “rights” not-
withstanding, the Malays remain, econ-
omically, “on the outer”. The Alliance
has pursued orthodox, conservative fiscal
policies admirable for the rubber and tin
orientation of the economy. Can these
continue?
Tun Razak has taken the responsibility
for seeing that the Malays have not been
economically neglected, but the stark
fact remains that Malay discontents are
likely to increase as the urban areas go
ahead faster than the rural ones. Too
much loose talk of Malaysia having the
second, now third, highest standard of
living in Asia should blind no one to the
key conundrum of the economy—wide
disparity, not only regionally but within
and between the communities.
1965, the year of Singapore’s separ-
ation, illustrated how easily suscep-
tibilities, if not emotions, can come to
the boil. While Razak believes the
Alliance formula is what the nation
needs, unlike some of his colleagues he is
well able to calculate that the nation
needs continual persuasion if it is to
share this belief. What is less easy to
discern is whether he is as well aware of
the many reasons why this task of per-
suasion may become a very difficult one
indeed.
Just how much has been achieved
by way of the compromises which hold
out the hope of functional, if not emo-

tional, integration is well indicated by
Razak’s own life. He comes from
Pahang State (he was born in March
1922, at Pekan, the Royal capital, now
within his constituency) where his father
as Razak’s name indicates, Dato
Hussein was one of the territorial
chiefs under the Sultan. Today he is able
to joke to Afro-Asians that, even with
such feudal origins, he himself has no
large land-holdings. The very fact of his
coming from Pahang is no longer of
great importance to his political future as
it might well have been in an earlier
period of much greater Malay interstate
rivalry. For that matter, his marriage to
a Johore Malay girl would have been
severely frowned upon, even impossible,
not so long ago.
The British colonial period and policy
created a multi-racial situation but did
little or nothing to create a multi-racial
society. Traditional Malay society was
protected, the Malays themselves were
paternalised and the non-Malays left to
their own devices. Thus Razak’s school-
ing was at the local “Eton”, Malay
College, Kuala Kangsar. Pre-war it was
for the sons of sultans, datos, the tra-
ditional elite, only. Today it is still
exclusively Malay and some aver that it
still produces a snobbish outlook.
"Demembering his background, it is not
so surprising that when the Tun and
the Tunku were in London studying law
immediately after the war “he was
very serious even in those days,” recol-
lects the Tunku the main problem
for them seemed the unity of Malays
themselves in the Malay Society of
Britain, which the British had done
nothing to encourage at home, rather
than, as for Keng Swee and Chin Chye,
the unity of all Malayans in the Malayan
Forum. Nonetheless, Razak joined, and
was active, in the latter, too. Still, when
the Tunku became UMNO president in
1951 at Razak’s urging (UMNO itself
was formed originally to restore the
pre-war colonial status quo, when Britain
produced Malayan Union to replace it)
it was Malay unity once again that
attracted his attention:
“. .. This is a Malay country, and
privileges should be given to the
Malays ... What will become of the
Malays if we concede every time to
the insatiable demands of the other
races? . . . Some people say indepen-
dence should be handed to ‘Malayans’.
Who are these ‘Malayans’? The
Malays will decide who the ‘Malay-
ans’ should be. The Chinese and the
Indians . . . love their own languages
and countries more . . .”
The Malays and the Malayans and the
Malaysians have come a long way
but have they come far enough? A coo*

ce rn for Malay unity must remain but,
having broken down barriers within their
community, it still remains true that
Malays prefer their group solidarity to
lowering the barriers between all com-
munities. (So, to a greater or lesser
extent, do the other groups.)
The crucial Alliance weakness is not
simply their speed and momentum, in
politics, economics and integration, nor
yet their being long on compromise, short
in ideology. It is that with so many pulls
towards conflicting ends their lack of
purposeful direction may weaken the
compromises they have yet to make.
fpHis weakness appears to be Razak’s
also. No dynamic approach emerges
from his often-platitudinous speeches,
sincerely yet often listlessly delivered.
His laudable stress on mundane things
like “good government”, “steady rate of
progress”, “sound thinking”, “sensible
leadership”, while given respectful atten-
tion, especially by Malay audiences,
would be no competition to more dema-
gogic appeals. His essential pragmatism
apparently leads him to the belief that
problems can be best eliminated through
administration, organisation, moderation.
He may be right but in the country he
will one day lead the corollaries of this
belief an indifference to grappling
with the human factor, to making any
radical changes in the social structure
seem inappropriate.
Thus Razak frequently confronts the
problems of an ex-colonial administra-
tive system created to carry out a “hold-
ing” operation, now charged with imple-
menting a developmental one. He tells
civil servants to cut out red tape, to
eliminate wasteful minuting. Like Lee
Kuan Yew in Singapore he exhorts, he
pleads, he demands action and efficiency.
Also like Lee he seems as yet uncon-
vinced that the answer may lie in the
system itself, appears unwilling to change
or alter a machine contrived for British
self-interest rather than the new needs
and demands of a different era.
The “human factor” is likewise in-
sufficiently recognised in Razak’s pet
concern rura. development. In Mal-
aysia it has been largely infrastructural,
dedicated more to changing the back-
ground of living, but not so much the
Pattern of life and outlook, for the rural
folk. The Tun again exhorts them to
w ork hard, to be self-reliant. But what
ls the meaning of being self-reliant when,
for example, you are forced by circum-
stances to rely on the (Chinese) middle
man? Why work hard when you do not
see that this is the cause and wealth the
effect?
Malaysian circumstances call for a
leader who has an emotional hold over,
a nd makes an impact on, all communi-
ties. This puts Razak’s quiet, self-effacing,
determined but not aggressive, person-
ality at something of a discount.
As he clearly indicated in a speech to
the University of Singapore students not
long before separation, he distrusts the
flamboyant, the theatrical, the dema-
gogic “you can’t run the country in the
same was as an actor (performs) ... you
can t. .. hold together in unity, peace,
and harmony merely in the same way as
an actor holds an audience in the glare
of the footlights ... in a nation of sen-
sible people good government and good
leadership (con e) not so much from
th_ front stage but from hard work,
sound thinking carried out at backstage”,
Yet statesmen also need more*
than a capacity for hard work and
sound thinking. In the same speech the
Tun criticised Sukarno for his “shallow
and hollow rule by rhetoric”, for his
“speeches, slogans, words and promises”
of like depth. But whatever Sukarno has
done, his manipulation of symbols and
slogans has advanced a feeling of Indo-
nesian identity.

The Literary Cat's Tail
SIR. —Miss Kylie Tennant (8., January
22) is in error not only in her assess-
ment of the number of stories published
by The Bulletin, but also in her
statistics relating to “Overland”. As she
is a member of the advisory board of
the Commonwealth Literary Fund, a
body which dispenses considerable funds
and favors, it is desirable that she have
her facts right. There were in fact three
issues of “Overland” published in 1965,
not merely one, as Miss Tennant states.
These issues appeared in March, August
and December. (Owing to holiday shut-
downs, the distribution of the latest issue
is not yet complete.) Thus “Overland”
published five or six stories (according
to definition) in 1965, not two. as Miss
Tennant states. Nor are the stories we
publish always “short”. In a recent issue
we printed a story of John Morrison’s
that was over 12,000 words in length.
Miss Tennant makes a silly remark
when she attempts to establish the credit
of Australian literary magazines on the
basis only of the stories they publish, and
adds that writers develop only by seeing
their work in print. I have no

80 Years Ago: February 6, 1886
r us, who have always looked towards
Federation as a step in the direction
of Australian National Autonomy, it cannot
fail to be gratifying that the first assem-
blage of a federal nature should have
afforded occasion for a public utterance of
the aspirations of Australian patriotism. The
speech of the venerable Premier of Tas-
mania fills us with as much joy as it has
overwhelmed some of our contemporaries
with dismay and confusion. The statements
made by Mr Douglas were that, in the
case of England being engaged in a
European war, the States of Australia
would necessarily consider the disadvan-
tages of the Imperial connection, and that,
apart from such a stimulus to a desire
for independence, the natural growth of
these communities must, in due course,
indispose them to their present position of
subordination, dependency, and political
inferiority. These colonies are no longer
mere congeries of expatriated Britons. And
every year increases the population of
native-born Australians. The time is already
past when to the people of Australia the
term of mother country, as applied to the
little islands on the other side of the world,
carries with it any sentimental value, or
bears the ring of a truthful epithet. To a
large proportion of the Australians of
to-day, Australia is their mother country,
and England is regarded in the remoter
relationship of the grandmother country.


It’s a good time
to think
internationally ...
\
Numbers of Australian manufacturers do
not think of selling beyond our shores.
Many have the mistaken idea that this sort
of thing is all right for the larger companies.
Actually, international trade has nothing to
do with size; it has to do with the ability to
compete —which is something many of the
smaller companies can do much better than
the giants.
We, at Lincoln, found this out and we are
extremely proud of our “E” for Export
Award.
It shows that there are trade opportunities
abroad if you can compete.
In the metals industry, one way to compete
it to be truly up with the times in produc-
tion technology.
If you use arc welding the man from Lin-
coln would like to help you use it with the
maximum efficiency.
As Australia’s largest manufacturer of arc
welding equipment we think it is our job to
see that our customers know about and
obtain the cost savings from new welding
technology.
It could lead to profitable export business
and be important to Australia.

doubt that seeing their work in print is
a great help to any writer, but for a
literary magazine to take on itself a
“workshop” function would be not only
to destroy its standards but would also,
in many cases, be a positive (or should
one say a negative) disservice to aspiring
writers. “Overland” would gladly
publish more good short stories, if
we could get them. We should have
liked to have printed our usual two
stories in our current issue, instead of
the one we do carry, but, in spite of the
hundreds of manuscripts we read a year,
there just was no second story of pub-

Monash Teach-in
SIR.—I write in reply to Mr Bolton’s
request (8., Jan. 29) for details on the
illiberal behavior of some of his col-
leagues prior to the Vietnam teach-in. I
rang the student organiser several days
before to tell them the newspaper for
which I work was considering sending
me down as a reporter and to find out
preliminary details of speakers and times.
Among other things they told me they
were having difficulty with speakers.
Next day they rang me in Canberra to
ask me whether I would speak (as well
as report) because they were in real
trouble, with Dennis Warner saying the
show was stacked in favor of the Left.
Only by getting me to speak would they
be able to hold Dennis Warner as a
speaker and have any semblance of
“balance”. Why me, I asked them. Why
not some prominent and capable pro-
Government speaker like Bob Santamaria,
or Frank Knopfelmacher? The answer
they gave me and being newsworthy
I of course immediately checked it
was that Dr K was being got at again.
Indeed, his name had been mentioned in
the early stages of discussions but a num-
ber of academics had objected. The names
of Professors R. Davis and J. Legge, of
Monash University, were mentioned. Pro-
fessor W. McMahon Ball of Melbourne
University had said that he would under
no circumstances speak on the same
platform as the terrible Dr K, despite
attempts by Dr Herb Feith to persuade
him to. Professor Legge later denied he
had been opposed to Dr K as a speaker
and the student organisers were angry
that I mentioned names in my report.
They said to me: “Why did you have
to mention Rufus (Davis) and Jack
(Legge)? It was very, very embarrassing
and, anyway, they were not the only ones
who objected to Knopfels.”

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The Myth of the Tastemakers
From ROBERT HUGHES in London
When I left Australia in 1964 most
painters and writers I knew
thought that an artist’s success
in London was a matter of whom you
knew, not what you did. You had to
know which buttons to press. Once you
hit them, Sesame opened. Joe Bloggs,
painter, would be whirled through a
tangle of contacts and pipelines until,
glittering rich, he arrived at the top.
One heard mysterious stories of How I
Just Missed The Jackpot. Thus one
painter, now well-known in Australia,
was wont to ascribe his lack of fame
in London to the fact that he didn’t go
to bed with a certain influential queer.
There was, and apparently still is, a
belief in the English Tastemakers —a
shadow cabinet of Machiavels who fore-
gather in Bond Street and Eaton Square
to resolve who shall be “in” tomorrow.
“A little more smoked salmon, Pere-
grine? Lemon? Yes, I think we shall
get rid of Iris Murdoch next week. And
Bacon and Braque. And the soft pedal
on Bridget Riley, but you’d better get
the TLS to revive David Gascoyne.”
Like all such conspiracy theories, this
is merely a comforting dream. Yet an
amazing number of Australians believe
it is the truth.
One of them is Max Harris, who is
very strong on an organisation which he
calls “the ‘London Magazine’ crowd” —-
whatever that may be. Being a contri-
butor to the “London Magazine”, I am
quite at a loss to see who, or where,
the plotters are. As far as I know,
most of the other writers not only dis-
agree among themselves to the point of
babel, but have never once got together
in a room.
Naturally, on a certain level, any
critic except oneself can be dismissed
as a “tastemaker”. In London, taste is
not “made” in this way. One can make
it in a small community like Sydney,
Melbourne or Adelaide, where there are
few serious artists, fewer critics, and
little fluent discussion of the arts. Under
such circumstances, anything that is said,
provided that it is said loudly enough,
will inevitably have an impact. This is
not necessarily so in a culture as wide-
ranging, international and many-celled as
London’s.
What London wants, most of all, is
some kind of originality or novelty from
its painters. The old procedure whereby
a painter served a long apprenticeship
in a garret in the Euston Road before, at
age 40, receiving the dizzy sum of £5O
for a mural, has vanished. Critics,
dealers and collectors haunt the art
schools—especially the Royal College of
Art—to snare new talent. Several of
England’s currently eminent young
artists were discovered in the egg in
this way: David Hockney, Allen Jones,
and the very promising sculptor Roland
Piche.
Part of the interest in Brett Whiteley,
when the Tate bought his painting in
1961, revolved around his extreme youth.
Five years later, painters expect to make
it young. Demand creates this situation:
the hundred galleries who need painters,
the critics who feel that their claim on
posterity will be to have discovered the
culture-hero of tomorrow.
The whole question of London reputa-
tions is, understandably, confusing to
Australians, because of the humiliating—.
and to many people, inexplicable—col-
lapse of the image of a national school
of Australian painters, after its glittering
auspices with the Whitechapel show in
1961. London now is wary of national
mystiques, whether they take the form
of the Ecole de Paris, the New York
School, or the Australians. Bryan Robert-
son, writing of William Dobell in “The
Spectator” last October, mentioned that
the “initial goodwill” which English
critics and collectors had felt towards
Australian art in 1961 had now been all
but cancelled out by the minor artists
who clambered on the Australian band-
wagon and broke its chassis.
In the forming of opinion, London is
like Animal Farm: all animals are equal
but some are more equal than others.
Some galleries matter and others don’t;
some institutions have more power than
others; some critics are influential and
others, however widely read, change
nothing. And certain painters have their
effect, too. Probably if you got these
men, or the representatives of these
institutions, together in a room and
tossed a couple of grenades in after
them, the London • art scene would be
left rudderless; but the likelihood of such
a putsch is remote because they don’t
often get together.
To begin with the institutions. Eng-
land’s museum of modern art is the

Tate, housed in a badly-planned and
ugly neo-classical gallery beside the
Thames at Millbank. It is limited by
lack of funds (its annual spending power
of £stgl 10,000, which looks huge by
Australian standards, does not enable it
to compete on the market for 20th
century masterpieces with any one of 15
galleries in the USA) and difficult to
reach by public transport, but to hang
there is the guarantee of an English
artist’s acceptance in his own country;
and thanks to the flexibility and intelli-
gence of its new director, Norman Reid,
and its board of trustees, which includes
the critic Andrew Forge, the art philo-
sophers Sir Herbert Read and Adrian
Stokes, the artists Ceri Richards and
Victor Passmore, and the collector
Robert Sainsbury, the Tate is able
within the limitations of money—to re-
spond fast to new developments.
Then there is the Whitechapel Gallery,
and its director, Bryan Robertson. “I am
not,” Bryan Robertson insists, “interested
in power. The Whitechapel exists to
stimulate situations and clarify them.”
And yet, because the Whitechapel under
Robertson’s direction has become Eng-
land’s best pointer to new developments
and reputations worthy of reassessment
in British and overseas art, people watch
it like a seismograph. And there is the
Institute of Contemporary Arts, and also
the Arts Council. It is the Arts Council
which decides on the official representa-
tion of British art overseas, at the Bien-
nales, and in travelling museum shows;
its most formidable figure is Lillian
Somerville.
It is a mistake to assume that opinion
is necessarily formed in public. A hun-
dred decisions and committee meetings
lie behind the presence of Joe Tilson’s
paintings at the Venice Biennale in 1964
or the sending of Patrick Heron’s to
Sao Paolo in 1965. One man may sit
on several committees yet make few
public statements. Roland Penrose, for
instance, is a most important figure in
the ecology of British art (and deservedly
so, since he has more experience of the
European avant-garde over the last 50
years than any of his colleagues except
Sir Herbert Read) yet he writes for no
newspapers, never appears on television
and has published little since his defini-
tive biography of Picasso was published
’n 1958. Yet he is a trustee of the
Tate, for which he organised the Picasso
and Miro retrospectives, and chairman
°f the ICA; and his influence is incal-
culable.
A painter's success depends, to a large
extent, on the gallery he shows with.
There are more than 40 galleries in Lon-
don. Of them, perhaps eight are con-
stantly reviewed; and these are the ones
|hat most painters would like to finish
J n. They are Marlborough, and its sub-
sidiary for younger painters, the New
London Gallery; Hanover, Tooth’s, Wad-
dington, and Gimpel Fils; and two com-
parative newcomers, Kasmin and Robert
Fraser. It is no exaggeration that these
firms between them represent nearly
every major artist in Great Britain, quite
apart from their links with overseas gal-
leries and local rights on foreign painters.
The most noticeable thing about Eng-
lish art criticism is that, far from being
the work of a clique, it has no centrality
at all. Art criticism in the popular
Press is merely art writing, a poor relative
of journalism. The critic (often a man
of mediocre sensibility and little know-
ledge of the history of art, who has been
cut down from a more “responsible” job
and given the art column for want of
anything better to do) is a 300-word
reporter. It is not his business to throw
out fresh ideas or suggest new interpreta-
tions. Accordingly, painters ignore him;
though what he writes may have some
marginal effect on sales. The best index
of a critic’s position is the excitement he
stimulates among artists —whether they
agree with him or not. Few people
bother to dispute the opinions of Terance
Mullaly, Pierre Jeannerat, Edwin Mul-
lins, the anonymous critic of “The
Times”, or even (despite the traditional
prestige of his paper) the “Observer’s”
Nigel But whatever the varia-
tions in quality—the root of such critics’
defects is that they write as if art bored
them —at least no English critic I know
of is bought, which is more than can
be said of their counterparts in Paris
or Rome.
The consistently interesting and in-
fluential critics in England today are
David Sylvester, John Berger, John
Russell, Andrew Forge, Bryan Robertson
and Robert Melville. Nearly all the dis-
coveries in Engish art over the last 10
years have been made by these men.
They have nearly nothing in common,
however, except their intense curiosity
about works of art and their readiness
to argue their conclusions out. If they
form a clique, it is like no other clique
I have seen. Perhaps the best answer
to the question of which buttons to
press in London was given by Marcel
Duchamp, in a different context. “There
is no solution. Because there is no
problem.”
Lively Skeletons
By DON LIPSCOMBE
Some not-so-old skeletons will be lift-
ed out of West Australian cupboards
and given a public airing this week
at the Festival of Perth. The advance
publicity on Son et Lumiere—“the his-
torical pageant of light and sound”—
makes it sound like glorious-heritage stuff
But, after reading Allan Aldous’ script, I
can visualise some uncomfortable shift-
mg of bottoms in the audiences out front
of the old Fremantle Asylum during
performances. Mr Aldous, a former West
Australian and now a noted radio script-
writer, sat down to write with a twinkle
in his eye and, perhaps, his tongue in his
cheek.
Acknowledging that his aim, while pre-
serving historical accuracy, was to pro-
duce family entertainment, the result is
far closer to a send-up than to a chronicle
of greatness.
Take the piece on Thomas Peel. The
meagre schoolboy history recalled has
him painted as a minor rogue who tried
to sell the British on the idea of emigrat-
ing to the west coast of the Antipodes for
his own personal gain. Aldous has re-
tained and even upgraded this impres-
sion, pointing out that Thomas Peel was
a cousin of the Prime Minister Sir John

The Festival of Perth offers Australia’s
first full-scale son et lumiere presentation.
Since it is also the first time anything
from the festival has been staged in
Fremantle, the port city is taking it up
in a big way. Ships in the harbor will
be dressed for the occasion, there will
be a sail-past of powerboats, bands will
play overtures for the audiences, the
Lions Club has made this its Service
Project for 1966 and will organise ticket
sales and ushering, and there’s even talk
of Navy men and police being dressed
in 19th-century garb.
If it flops, the whole Festival bank
balance will go. The complex stereo and
lighting equipment cost about £75,000,
with hiring charges well over £lO,OOO.
An average of 1000 people will have to
sit out the If hours over the 17 nights
for the gamble to break even.

Dracula. Dramatised by Hamilton Deane
and John Bladerstone from Bram Stoker’s
novel. Elizabethan Theatre. Sydney.
Dracula, tdp vampire, after a
successful demi-millenial career of
blood-sucking in Transylvania, decides to
emigrate. Accompanied by some ec-
centric luggage six large rectangular
boxes filled with soil he takes a night
flight to London. According to the
vampire code he has to spend the day-
light hours buried in his native earth.
Count Dracula is a model immigrant.
No complaints about the accommodation:
he buys up a battered old mansion in
the country and a few houses in Lon-
don. No difficulties in job adjustment.
“This” he exclaims, “is a land of oppor-
tunity! A population of millions!” His
policy of “depopulate or perish” would,
of course, make him unsuitable as a New
Australian.
The Count is cordially welcomed io

genteel society. He is a constant caller at
the home of his nearest neighbor, Dr
Seward, whose daughter Lucy, poor girl,
is mysteriously fading away. Just arrived
from Holland to help her is Dr Van
Helsing, an old friend of Dr Seward, who
is an expert on anaemia. By a most for-
tunate coincidence he also happens to
be an expert on werewolves, vampires
and suchlike Transylvanian phenomena.
His unorthodox scientific theories are,
of course, rubbished by men of common
sense such as Dr Seward, just like those
of his colleague Dr Freud in Vienna.
Dr Van H. very soon suspects Count
D. and sends off to Transylvania to check
the noble gentleman’s credentials. Back
at once comes the answer: Count Dra-
cula has been dead and buried this past
five hundred years. This might puzzle
the immigration authorities, but not Dr
Van Helsing.
Searching round for some illuminating
critical pronouncement after seeing Paul
Stockman’s production of “Dracula” I <
can find only this: the stage is not suited
to horror films. In the realistically stuffy
but reassuring Victorian comfort of Dr
Seward’s study (designed by Ron Tun-
stall) Count Dracula can be accepted as
an eccentric and even sinister foreign
gentleman. But as a blood-sucking vam-
pire commuting between town and coun-
try coffins? No. This play seems to me to
have great comic possibilities but little
hope of lowering the temperature of
anyone’s blood.
One thing puzzles me: a question of
zoology. How can a vampire, which is
a kind of bat, be at the same time a were-
wolf, which is a kind of wolf?

producers of “Bambole” had a
stroke of luck when they were rap-
ped over the knuckles by the Vatican
and the Italian Government for obscen-
ity; the resultant publicity aroused an
interest in the film which turns out to
have been largely unjustified. It’s a mild
affair, the basic argument of which is
that men and women often find each
other attractive, and sometimes do some-
thing about it. This will hardly surprise
any member of the audience whose age
is into double figures, but this supposedly
sophisticated comedy looks at the fact
of normal sexual intercourse with shock-
ed and delighted giggles.
It’s made up of four stories with dif-
ferent directors and no real connection
except that each one involves a pretty
woman (with black underwear) and that
at some stage she goes to bed with a
man. The best sequence (not that it’s any
masterpiece) is “Monsignor Cupid”,
slickly directed by Bolognini and boasting
a very neat comedy performance by
Gina Lollobrigida as a lickerish land-
lady who enlists the inadvertent aid of
a prelate in her seduction of his hand-
some, virginal nephew. “The Soup”, a
labored piece about a wife’s attempts to
rid herself of an oafish husband, at least
gives Monica Vitti the chance to display
herself as a highly accomplished comedi-
enne, deftly guying her own Antonioni-
image of enigmatic sadness. The other
stories both wring a simple jest long after
the last drops of humor are extracted;
their stars, Virna Lisi and Elke Sommer,
are more remarkable for prettiness than
for talent. “Bambole” is certainly not
obscene; it’s not even very good fun.

BOOKS
The Berkeley Students’ Soviet
By FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
DEMONSTRATORS AT BERKELEY
The Berkeley Student Revolt Facts and
Interpretations. Edited by Seymour Martin
Lipset and Sheldon S. Wolin. A Double-
day Anchor Original. 245. 6d.
** A rifle in the hands of a worker in-
volves a totally different historical
principle than the same rifle in the hands
of a student,” wrote Trotsky as late as
i 932. The history of the Russian intel-
ligentsia from the Decembrist conspiracy
to Lenin, and the more recent history
of Castroism and related movements
throughout the underdeveloped part of
the world, seem to belie the old Bolshevik
trust in the “proletariat” as the standard-
bearer of revolution. The proletariat and
the peasantry supply only the inert matter
of revolutions. The intelligentsia and,
very prominently, the students provide
the form and the activist ingredient.
The present book makes it clear beyond
doubt —it is the one major point on
which all the diverse contributors are
agreed that what took place at Ber-
keley in 1964-65 was a real revolution
with serious implications for the nation
as a whole, and not just another student
prank.
The setting was a “multiversity” par
excellence. An enormous federation of
eight colleges, of which Berkeley alone
accommodates 27,000 students, the Uni-
versity of California is, in the words of
its president, Dr Clark Kerr, “a know-
ledge factory” closely interlinked with
State, Federal and privately incorpor-
ated power. The Board of Regents is a
committee consisting of California’s top
political and corporate brass a text-
book illustration of C. Wright-Mills’s con-
cept of the power-elite. The president is
a brilliant and energetic administrator, an
erudite and pragmatic Quaker and very
much a man of what the American Right
Calls “the liberal establishment-”. The
dominant philosophy of the teaching
faculties is unqualified liberalism with a
strong radical tinge. Kerr and his ad-
ministrative machine have resisted, in
turn, loyalty oaths, political investigations
of the campus by the State House Com-
mittee on Un-American Activities, and
the exclusion of Communist speakers
from university premises. A few weeks
before history selected him for the hap-
less role of Kerensky to Mario Savio’s
Trotsky, Kerr was awarded the Meikle-
john prize for contributions to academic
freedom by the American Association
of University Professors. The occasion
was Kerr’s lifting of the ban on Com-
munist speakers. And yet it is Kerr who
has since become the hate symbol of the
campus Left: they spell his name “cur” on
their placards. It seems that, unlike revo-
lutions, ritualistic liberalism is being
devoured by its own children.
The university’s policy is dominated
by high-powered research, and by
pressure-cooker training curricula de-
signed to turn out competent men for
elite positions in the professions, in lab-
oratories and in public and private ad-
ministrative agencies. The growth-rate
of the university is staggering, its graduate
training programme massive and the
education of undergraduates streamlined.
There is no real evidence for the claim
made by some contributors that the im-
personal “processing” style of Berkeley’s
undergraduate training-programme has
turned Berkeley undergraduates into a
neglected and alienated proletariat. Yet
there is considerable evidence that the
faculty failed abysmally, outside the nar-
row and fragmented bits of training cur-
ricula, in providing the students with a
significant moral and political guidance,
which may consist solely in teaching them
how to make rational and responsible
choices with respect for the “logic of
ideas and events”. On the Berkeley cam-
pus the task was usurped by the con-
spirator and the demagogue.
The precipitating cause of the revolt
was an extension of an administration
ban on political activities related to off-
campus issues to a strip of land where
they had been traditionally tolerated.
For the last two or three years Ber-
keley students have been very active in
the civil rights movement throughout
the San Francisco Bay area; they par-
ticipated in frequent sit-ins, teach-ins,
shop-ins, etc., and they managed to
create a rumpus at the San Francisco
Republican convention, backing Scranton
against Goldwater. In the process they
became a thorn In the side of many a
solid citizen. According to a widely
believed rumor, the ban on the strip was
issued at the request of the Goldwaterite
Senator Knowland, whose newspaper, the
Oakland “Tribune”, had shortly before
been subjected to a student sit-in, for an
alleged refusal to hire Negro staff.
The students responded by turning
against the administration the civil
disobedience methods, which they had
picked up in the civil rights movement.
Massive demonstrations, sit-ins, and the
systematic breaking of college rules
followed. Police, sometimes several hun-
dred strong, soon became a part of the
campus landscape. The administration,
which had introduced the ban on the
transparently insincere pretext that poli-
tical canvassing on the disputed strip of
land obstructs traffic, failed at first to
meet the students’ challenge and to en-
force the rules, but it proceeded even-
tually to discipline randomly selected
culprits pour encourager les autres.
The students responded by stepping up
their campaign of civil disobedience,
and when police tried to remove a
culprit from the campus, thousands of
demonstrators surrounded the police car
and kept it stuck on the campus for
thirty-six hours amidst a massive sit-in
cum vigil. The student-leader Mario
Savio harangued the crowd from the roof
of the captured car (which he mounted
with his shoes off perhaps a petty
bourgeois deviation).
At that stage the university was rapidly
ceasing to be a functioning institution,
and Kerr proceeded to negotiate with the
ringleaders and with the Board of
Regents to restore law and order.
Following Kerr’s strong pleading the
Regents granted the demand for freedom
of unrestricted advocacy of extra-mural
political activities, but added a rider that
such activities must be legal. This
satisfied the moderates who formed the
majority of the revolting rank and file
and it looked as if peace and return to
normal university work were in sight. By
that time, however, the extremists a
coalition of loosely-defined Castroites,


Trotskyites, Maoists, Moscow-line Com-
munists and ordinary crackpots all
highly skilled in the use of the organisa-
tional weapon managed to gain com-
plete control of the student “soviet”, the
so-called free speech movement, formed
in defiance of established and duly-elected
student representative bodies. The mod-
erates were outfoxed and eliminated from
positions of leadership and the ex-
tremists proceeded to set up in all earn-
estness actually using some of the
terms themselves a system of dual
power, the free speech movement play-
ing the role of a “soviet” counter-govern-
ment, as if in Petrograd of 1917. The
Regents’ concessions were rejected and
the FSM escalated its campaign by
demanding freedom of advocacy for
illegal off-campus activities. The im-
mediate object became, in the words of
Savio, “to bring the college to a grinding
halt”.
A minor blunder of the unfortunate
administration was used as a pretext for
staging The Storming of the Winter
Palace: On December 2, Bdo FSM-con-
trolled students invaded and occupied
Sproul Building, the administrative centre
of the college. The building was retaken
the following day by 700 cops assembled
from all parts of the Bay area and
directed personally by the Democratic
Governor of California, Edward G.
Brown. The students were forcibly ejected
from the building, arrested, and charged
with various offences. The FSM then
declared a general strike in which many
staff members participated. Thus the
college was, indeed, brought “to a grind-
ing halt”.
Then occurred what was probably the
most fatal event of all, the faculty (all
permanent teaching staff members) in
lts collective wisdom found its voice. It
met and voted resolutions in favor of
a J demands and for an amnesty of
a offenders. A proposal to exclude ad-
vocacy of illegal activities was defeated
737 votes against 284. The faculty’s
unwise decision is a miniature in the best
suicidal tradition of ritualistic liberalism:
as long as the student movement was
still influenced by moderates who pre-
sented legitimate demands, the faculty
ignored it and provided no guidance.
Yet the moment it fell into the hands of
extremists and rowdies, whose intentions
are utterly destructive of a functioning
university, the faculty “went to Munich”
and identified itself with its own execu-
tioners.
Since February, 1965, the college has
been plagued by a new outbreak: the
“filthy speech movement” or, as Pro-
fessor Feuer called it, pornopolitics.
Two magazines of a familiar style,
“Spider” and “For Unlawful Carnal
Knowledge”, combining infantile ob-
scenity with Left-wing propaganda,
appeared on the campus and led to pro-
secutions under the Obscenity Act.
T>ornopolitics of one kind or another
has been a constant feature of the
revolt, fanned, it seems, particularly by
the Maoist elements. Invitations to parti-
cipate in combined heterosexual-homo-
sexual orgies were broadcast by students
through the college loudspeakers (with
the administration’s permission) together
with appeals for money for the Vietcong
and with detailed instructions on how to
dodge the draft. Pornopolitics seems to
have served three purposes: a tactical one
of provoking campus authorities into fur-
ther punitive action which would keep the
“revolutionary spirit” alive, and a more
fundamental one of bringing the students
into collision with the basic sexual taboos
of a despised and rejected society, in a
gesture of ultimatistic nihilism. A similar
use of pornopolitics has occurred, almost
simultaneously, within an Australian uni-
versity context. It has since become a
common feature of Australian Left-
wing campus politics.
The general reforming and militant
zeal generated by the movement for
Negro equality provides the chief im-
petus for the upsurge of student activism
in the USA. The ambiguities of the civil
rights movement were clearly reflected
on the Berkeley campus. Unlike the
liberal democrats who form the majority
of the civil rights movement and make
up the bulk of its Negro leadership,
the revolutionaries in it do not see the
movement as a set of actions to extend
full civic and social rights to the Negro
within the framework of the American
social order. They see it rather as a
device where the hollowness of American
democracy can be exposed and dis-
credited. It seems that the unfortunate
Negro has to face yet another form of ex-
ploitation: to serve as a black screen
for the projection of sado-masochistic
phantasies from white adolescents.
Literature from the extremist leader-
ship of the FSM made it quite clear that
their interests in the civil rights move-
ment was “revolutionary” in this sense.
It was linked to a thoroughgoing revo-
lutionary programme for universities—•
demanding that they should altogether
contract out of all affiliations with the
institutional framework of American
society and with a blatantly pro-Com-
munist line on American foreign policy.
Mario Savio and his mates made it abun-
dantly clear that, in their eyes, there was
no “real” difference between the racists
of Alabama, the Democratic Governor
of California and the ultra-liberal Presi-
dent Kerr. Thus the very civil diso-
bedience methods used legitimately in the
South to enforce the law and the consti-
tion were turned, at Berkeley, against a
liberal government and a liberal-pro-
gressive university administration to
flout the law and the spirit of the con-
stitution.
Those among the contributors to the
present volume who have understood
what hit Berkeley view the future with
foreboding. Professor Glazer fears that
the FSM may try to usurp the running
of the university altogether, including
the selection of staff. Few really believe
that the administration is capable of
solving the crisis.
The book does not present a pro-
gramme of reconstruction and preven-
tion, though a feasible one exists. Al-
though little can be expected from the
administration and from the faculty at
large, there is an element of hope in the
students themselves and in the sizeable
minority of politically sophisticated and
intelligent teachers. As the war
in Vietnam continues and casualties con-
tinue to mount, it is unlikely that the
American public, which is overwhelm-
ingly opposed to the FSM and similar
bodies, will tolerate for much longer
student demonstrators carrying Viet-
cong flags and punctuating Maoist pro-
paganda with infantile filth. Democratic
action by progressive** yet anti-
totalitarian students is all the more im-
portant, because the forces of outraged
communal “normality” might otherwise
be brought to bear on Berkeley and
similar places indiscriminately, and it
would be a pity if they smashed the
good with the bad. If anti-totalitarian
students and professors decided to or-
ganise and if they linked up with demo-
cratic bodies outside the campus (as
the extremists are linked up with their
own off-campus parent bodies) they
could wrest control from the ex-
tremists quite easily. It would then be
their task to separate the good from the
bad and to preserve the positive achieve-
ments of the Berkley student movement
without subscribing to revolutionary
nihilism and subversion.

The Banjo and the Bards
By W. HART-SMITH
Australian Writers and their Work:
Lansdowne. Bs. 6d. each.
A. B. (Banjo) Paterson. Clement Semmler.
lames McAuley. Vivian Smith.
Douglas Stewart. Nancy Keesing.
•Tlhese are the three latest additions to a
"*■ series of essays on Australian writers.
Of the three I found Clement Semm-
ler’s essay on Banjo Paterson the easiest
and most enjoyable to read. It is a bal-
anced study of one of Australia’s finest
journalists who, among other things,
wrote ballads and gave us our unofficial
National Anthem. It is fascinating to
see him emerging not just as a
balladist, as the author of “The Man
From Snowy River”, but as a writer of
sketches and short stories; a man with an
intimate knowledge of his country and
his people, well-educated, and with a
gift for “happy intimacy with all sorts
of queer people”.
Vivian Smith’s essay on James Mc-
Auley is an immensely thorough and re-
sponsible work. An enormous amount
of research, thought, reading and dis-
cussion has obviously gone into it. More
than once I found myself enjoying Vivian
Smith’s prose more than James McAuley’s
poetry, or at least more than those ex-
amples used to illustrate his text. The
editor’s choice of Vivian Smith to write
this particular essay confirms what I
feel was his deliberate intention, namely
to choose someone who knows personally
and is a close friend of the writer he is
writing about. Thus we have essays writ-
ten with sympathy, understanding and
intimate personal knowledge. It pays to
have friends.
Vivian Smith presents McAuley’s ethos
with sympathy and at great length, writing
some very beautiful philosophical-reli-
gious prose about McAuley’s religious
philosophy; this is criticism grand in con-
ception, though not so grandly served by
the verse.
Mr Smith spends a little too much
time on Captain Quiros and what is in-
tellectually and metaphysically behind it.
One’s interest depends on what one ex-
pects of poetry, and how one dis-
tinguishes it from verse, and whether one
expects poetry to delight and surprise and
be its own explanation rather than to
instruct and explain oneself and one’s
attitude to the world.
Mr Smith writes: “One of the para-
doxes of Art, to which the best modern
critics and artists never cease to draw
our attention, is that ‘Art which aims at
Beauty cannot find inspiration in Good
alone’. As D. J. Enright has said, deve-
loping an idea dear to Beaudelaire, ‘it
must consort with evil.’ Coherence and
simplicity in art are not absolute values
in themselves; they depend for their full
effect on the degree of complexity and
confusion that has been taken into ac-
count.” So far so good. But then: “The
lyrics in ‘Black Swans’, with their fine,
delicate strength, affirm the good and
proclaim the presence of light and order;
but all reveal an intense awareness of
evil, darkness and discord — transcended ”
(my italics). “Their power comes from
the fact they apprehend and affirm order
in front of a deeply experienced sense
of the constant threat and possibility of
disorder.”
It seems to me the point has been
missed somewhere. Perhaps it is that
very goodness, decency and nobility in
McAuley’s work which is gradually
shifting it away from poetry towards
verse. The poet, as I see it, is not merely
aware of the existence of evil; he has, in
fact, some evil in himself. It’s what he
does about it that determines his stature,
A poet is likely to have quite a lot o £
vermin in the ermine.
These excellent essays thoroughly
and responsibly done as they are —d o
nothing, especially when one looks at
the list of those authors already available
and those still in preparation, to correct
the suspicion that, in Australia, the more
rafferty unpredictable fellows with their
more spontaneous and compulsive writ-
ing are unacceptable to the scholar-critic
and the new breed of literati. The expert-
menting fellows, those willy-nilly deeply
involved in the workaday world of hypo-
crisy and double standards, spill over the
edges of propriety. They burst out. They
seldom, if ever, calmly decide on a
theme towards some major opus and
head more than heart driven settle
themselves to write, in verse. Which leads
me to the consideration; is it not extra-
ordinary that so much Australian poetry
is reading-inspired and literature-lofted?
Douglas Stewart’s opus, as Nancy
Keesing points out, includes both litera-
ture and history - derived narrative
poetry all of it rich in spontaneous,
compulsive poetry. As well as this, as a
writer Stewart has done much reviewing
and article-writing and has written one
major critical work, “The Flesh and the
Spirit”. He has also “discovered” and
nourished many poets, more unselfishly
and generously and encouragingly than
any man I know. I am glad that Nancy
Keesing has stressed this aspect in her
essay.
She has obviously put an immense
amount of work into this book, which,
apart from indications of heavy revision
and much re-writing, is an admirable
example of the way to present an im-
portant writer and poet, his work, his
attitudes, his philosophy, without adopt-
ing any contentious critical standpoint.
One is left to form one's own value judg-
ments according to one’s taste, one’s affin-
ities, one’s predilections.
Locked
Locked in the clock of my brain, ears
Cringe at the cricket-chirps, foot-screeps
On the pebble path. A starved god
Squats in my mind, twitching, watching,
Waiting to die. After the waft
Of mown lawn, my spirit springs free
As a genie, floats out spiralling.
Eyes browse at the blurted moon-rise
Of elephant, parading clouds; my west
arm
Arcs over to the east, ci reusing yes
Follow me, my love, where mist hills,
hefted
Like dinosaurs, lift through the night.
I will give everything away.

Thomas Mann’s Genius
By SYBILLE SMITH
Ihomas Mann. Andrew White. Oliver and
Boyd. 7s. 9d.
Last year was the 90th anniversary of
Mann’s birth, and the 10th of his
death. It was marked, not only by those
tributes which confirm, together with a
writer’s greatness, the fact that he is
harmlessly out of the way, but by re-
newed controversy and serious critical
attention.
Rather in the manner of a tourist
consciously avoiding centres of tourism,
Mr White avoids the well-worn critical
approaches. His reassessment of two
comparatively neglected works, “Fior-
enza” and “Royal Highness’’, which he
sees as marking the turning point in
Mann’s development, is excellent, and he
gives a fine analysis of the recurrent
theme of the hero’s withdrawal from time.
His thesis leads him to over-simplifica-
tion and even misrepresentation in some
comments on “The Magic Mountain”
(“Disgust for death becomes his inspira-
tion for life. Castorp ends the novel . . .
freed of all attachment to death”) and
on “Dr Faustus”, where White sees
Leverkiihn’s salvation as automatic, not
at least paradoxical, and at no point
even mentions his collapse.
The basic flaw in White’s approach is,
1 think, his underplaying of philosophical
influences and, particularly, his super-
ficial treatment of Schopenhauer’s place
in Mann’s thought. He sees Mann as un-
critically dominated by Schopenhauer up
to and including “Buddenbrooks”; it be-
comes clear that any hint of pessimistic
philosophy constitutes an irritant which
even affects Mr White’s prose—in one
page he speaks of the “stupor from the
heady draught of Schopenhauer”, “Scho-
penhauer’s spiritual chloroform” and
his “laming metaphysical narcosis”. Later
he remarks “The plot winds into meta-
physical hysteria around a threading in
which comic and serious strands turn
h>to each other”. After “Buddenbrooks”,
Nietzsche is seen to replace Schopenhauer
as an influence and, presumably, to
straighten Mann out on a few vital points,
® r White implies that hereafter the
s hadows lose their real threat and serve
® ain ly to emphasise the light. In fact,
°wever, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche ->
are balanced against each other in Mann’s
Wor k from the start, and he outgrows the
•atluence of both without ceasing to re-
s P e ct them. , tt
The structure of the book one
c apter on Mann’s life, four on the stages
0 development of his fiction, one each
on his critical and political writings and
one on works on Mann is well-balan-
ced. The extra attention given to the
political writings balances a deficiency in
this field, and the treatment of the criti-
cal and theoretical writing is excellent,
emphasising its close connection with the
fictional works. Perhaps the only omis-
sion is a comment on style and form,
which would have been especially interes-
ting in connection with the illuminating
discussion of parody and humor. The
book covers a wide range without any
sense of haste or cramming. The final
chapter provides a useful guide to further
study, with comments on, and cautions on
the prejudices of, selected works on
Mann. Mr White, of course, is also not
without prejudices; but this is a stimul-
ating and original approach to Mann.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Adding to the Swings
rpHE balmy days are almost over. Yet in the last few months, money has actually
been in reasonable supply to those with the right name, the right underwriter
and the right security.
And people have even been talking
about a shortage not of money but of
first-rate fixed interest public borrowings
to put their money into It was not just
all talk. The double subscription to the
£4m Boral debenture issue was solid
evidence of that.
This holiday away from the facts of
monetary life is soon to end, as the
special factors that brought it about are
removed from the scene. Not only does
the flow of money from exports reach
a seasonal peak every year from Septem-
ber on; some of the more eccentric of the
Federal Government’s devices for run-
ning the economy also make their pre-
sence felt.
There are people who take the view
that the financial operations of a govern-
ment should, where possible, be aimed
at evening out the natural ups-and-downs
of economic activity. The Australian
financial authorities do not appear to
subscribe to this proposition preferring
to use methods of financing their own
operations that mean, on the contrary,
an accentuating of the natural ups-and-
downs.
For example, the Government’s
method of paying for its operations is to
spend money it does not possess in the
first three-quarters of the year and then
collect the money in the last quarter. It
does this by borrowing from the Reserve
Bank, issuing Treasury Bills, which it
then redeems when tax money comes in
throughout March-June. There is a lot
of money involved in this; from a level
of only £36 million in July the Reserve
Bank’s holdings of Treasury Bills and
Notes had jumped to £lB2 million by last
November, so pumping money into the
economy at exactly the time it was not
needed.
It will then take money out of the
economy at exactly the time when it jj
needed when liquidity gets reasonably
tight in March-June.
Of course the authorities can counter
the impact of their own policies by using
other policies especially for the occa-
sion, and hoping that one policy will
offset the other. For instance, they will
no doubt make some releases of large
sums of cash from the statutory reserve
deposits of the trading banks, which the
Reserve Bank holds and which total
around the £330 million mark. This may
be about the only readily usable major
device still open to the authorities to
bring a bit of cash into the economy at a
time when they are solidly taking it out.
Even the Government’s loan raising
programme seems more likely to accen-
tuate the liquidity problem than ease it
and surely the authorities could do
something about this simply by making
the dates of these cash issues suit the
needs of the economy a bit better. Last
November’s cash and conversion loan
could hardly be regarded as a serious
attempt to take advantage of high sea-
sonal liquidity to raise money to pay for
Government works. For the loan in fact
did not take any net money out of cir-
culation at all; the £56 million raised in
cash subscriptions did little more than
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the markets: Some of the industrial leaders
were roused a little from their torpor on most Australian
stock exchanges last week, although as yet far from
sufficiently to indicate that 1966 might be the year for
the rise being forecast for later on by one or two
brokers’ circulars; volumes and buying pressures remain
all too small. Investors’ energies and resources siill
remain faithfully directed towards the metals, with tins
temporarily usurping copper’s primacy at one stage.
However Mount Isa and a few minor copper issues
took the palm at the end . . . Hull and higher social
service payments will have to be swallowed by Lon-
don’s share markets just after they have more or less
successfully digested the new cash incentive scheme
for developmental industries. In the meantime, the
index forges perseveringly ahead on an obvious scrip
shortage and with blue chips moving all over the
place . . . Wall Street has no hesitation in over-riding
the professionals’ scorn on the exactness of the Dow
Jones’ indicator. Distinctly high volume trading is
the order of the day, helped by mutterings of inflation-
ary tendencies and such things as IBM’s share split and
increased dividend.
For companies: More Australian businesses fail-
ed during 1965 than in 1964, but most of them were
fledgelings of less than three years’ exposure to tight
money, the drought and a chillier investment climate.. .
Drought at least took the edge off two agricultural
implement makers, Chamberlain Holdings and Ralph
McKay in the December half-year, also leaving a
more obvious mark upon pastoralist Pitt, Son and Bad-
gery . . . Two lofty flyers of earlier years, Rothmans
and Ampol Petroleum, sounded rather less hearty . . .
Even G. J. Coles, up on both sales and profits, had to
mention some “soft spots” in the cities, NSW and
Queensland.
Nothing but the best 1965-66 seems to lie ahead,
however, for well-protected paper giants APM and
APPM ... An exemplary hire-purchase industry made
the most of tight money and reaped excellent rewards
Australian Guarantee Corporation as of habit,
Custom Credit as of yore and Commercial and General
Acceptance as of takeover . . . Tungsten from King
Island at present does not have to struggle against big
exports from the USSR and Communist China on world
markets, so King Island Scheelite (1947) was helped
further towards rejuvenation by three-times enlarged
profits for the year to October 31 last .. . Life assurance
is not quite so popular in the mildly straitened economy,
yet Colonial Mutual Life was untroubled to grow at
a faster rate in 1965 and faster than most of the
industry; for the Mutual Life and Citizens’ Assurance,
H. G. Palmer proved a pinprick, although harsher
troubles are still to come for the holding parent, MLC
. . . Australian teenagers (and their parents) don’t
only concentrate on hard liquor Victoria’s Cohn
Bros, facing both ways with its Carlton and United
Breweries’ interest, is selling more soft drinks as well,
and happily provides shareholders- with a one-for-five
bonus and guarantees of steady dividends.

offset the £55 million redemptions for
the maturing loans.
It also seems that the redemption
figure would have brought a substantial
increase to the amount of money avail-
able in the economy, as the new cash
raisings figure would have included a
sizable amount collected in prior sub-
scriptions over previous months, as well
as some switching from other Govern-
ment securities into bonds.
But if the November loan only served
to accentuate the economic swings, the
prospect of another cash loan in Febru-
ary will see the authorities joining in the
scramble for money just as seasonal
factors begin to reduce its availability.
And then, of course, there is the May
maturity of £164 million in short bonds,
the conversion of which will presumably
be accompanied by a cash element that
will also serve to accentuate the seasonal
run-down in money.
Added to all this is the fact that, this
year, the supply of money will not be
assisted in the three months April to
June by the States getting double their
normal works allocation. This year, they
will get their money in 12 equal monthly
amounts instead of nine lots of one-
fifteenth and three lots of two-fifteenths.
So the success of the Boral debenture
issue and the likely success of ACl’s
£6 million borrowing cannot be taken as
any hint that the shortage of money has
ended. Nor can the strength of the rights
market to the Bank of NSW’s £6 million
share issue nor the improvement in the
share price index.
On the contrary, it appears we are
soon to enter another of those very tight
liquidity periods at a time when the
economy has already shown some omi-
nous signs of slowing down. Planners,
both in the public service and in com-
panies, face a difficult time. One thing
that should cheer them up is that, after
it ends, the second half of 1966 should
be quite a bright six months.
Some Australian businessmen’s organi-
sation should consider awarding a prize
to the public servant who works out how
to arrange the Government’s financing
operations so that they do not clash so
directly with the public interest. The
prize should not be an Oscar. That has
already been awarded this year—to Dr
Coombs for showing the remarkable skill
to keep the economy steady while every-
one else, particularly the Government,
is adding to the swings.
Aur attention has been drawn to a
v sentence in an article on this
page, “After the Good Shepherd” (8.,
Jan. 22), which dealt with the prospect
of shareholders in other companies
following the lead set last year by Mr
Albert Shepherd in tackling the board
of BHP.
The sentence said that the sooner
auditors stopped allowing company
directors to tell lies in their balance
sheets, the better. This naturally was
not aimed at the directors of BHP.
This was a general comment about
company accounts that had specific
reference to directors of companies
who had caused immense losses to
their shareholders by falsely stating
profits and assets over many years.
The recent financial history of Aus-
tralia is full of examples of such
companies, most of whom are now
m the hands of the receivers.
In the case of BHP, there can be
no doubt about the propriety of the
company’s accounts. Any possible
implication from our article to the
contrary was not intended.

]V/|r Stanley Korman may not have
had much luck in running success-
ful companies, but he is very good
indeed at running annual meetings.
Last week’s meeting of Chevron Sydney,
the £7-million white elephant that rocked
all but one of the Korman group of
public companies right out of the boat,
showed Mr Korman has lost none of his
brilliance. When he sat down after his
chairman’s address, many shareholders
present would gladly have lost their
money once again in his company. Since
all but one of his public companies have
gone into receivership his speeches from
the chair have taken on a style that has
never been matched in Australia.
Korman emerges from these speeches
as a sorrowful, kindly, humble man try-
ing to do what he can to right the wrongs
that have somehow happened to his
shareholders; wrongs that he did not
cause and which would multiply but for
his eternal vigilance. Yet he is kind
enough to adopt a “more in sorrow than
in anger” approach to his critics, and even
to “the vultures on the sidelines picking
every bone clean as they are abandoned
or disposed of”.
Last week’s meeting of Chevron was
notable only for Mr Korman’s speech;
it was one of his best.
It had faith: “I have not lost heart for
I know that there are many of you who
still believe in me.”
It had hope: “I have long been of the
opinion—and I still believe—that all is
not lost. 1 know that the capital that
has been invested in this venture can still
be recovered. Many people have told
me that this is a vain hope, but I have
said to them that where there is a will
there is a way, and a way will be forth-
coming, given the time.”
And he advocated charity: “All I ask
is that you speak not in haste, nor suffer
anything to be done which we will in
due time regret.”
In practical terms all this meant as
little as most chairmen’s addresses when
their companies are in receivership, with
only a minimal chance that they will ever

emerge. No comment was offered on
the annual accounts. Mr Korman con-
centrated on emotional appeals for per-
sonal support and a lengthy preamble on
Factors Ltd., the only member of the
Korman group showing real signs of life.
Mr Korman said only through the group
could all the problems be resolved, al-
though “events beyond our control” pre-
vented proper co-ordination.
He described November 15, 1960, as
the day of the hurricane; it cost Austra-
lia £2OO million, Mr Korman estimated,
He gives the impression that factors be.
yond his control —the Government and
the laws of the land —were the elements
that blew the Korman house down; it was
not due to any inherent weaknesses in
the financial structure.
The simple facts about Chevron Syd-
ney are that it cost the company £7 mil-
lion to put up a hotel that cannot be sold
for one-third that price. Government
policies, credit squeezes, not even a solar
eclipse, can change the fact that a lot
of money was wasted on this progress;
that it was a sort of miniature Opera
House operation.
No-one can deny the remarkable ef-
fort Mr Korman has made to salvage
something from the Wreck of his public
company empire; shareholders, particu-
larly in Factors, have every reason to
be grateful for his attempts. But no-
one who reads the inspector’s report into
the remarkable devices employed by Mr
Korman and his fellow directors at
SDF can allow gratitude for his recent
efforts on their behalf to wipe out the
memory of what happened when Mr
Korman was booming and why his
empire crumbled.

have felt somewhat dubious about
Greenbushes Tin’s intention to use por-
tion of a new issue to fund part of its
short-term borrowings from the bank

levels of the world tin price could only
convince them that practically any move
to get their company fully, efficiently
and economically operative is justified,

around 1970.

Burgeoning Particle
•T'here may be more to the falling pro-
duction figures for hardboard than the
popular explanation that it follows a
slackening in the rate of new house
building.
The figures seem, on the contrary, to
reflect the first significant impact made
by a relatively recent rival product, parti-
cle board, on the building board market.
Whether particle board will actively cut
deep into hardboard’s market is yet to
be seen. It is already evident that particle
board, made from pinewood chips, is
as least limiting the growth of hardboard,
made from pulped wood.
The latest statistics show that, in the
last quarter of 1965, hardboard produc-
tion fell while particle board has been
continuing its significant production
increase of recent times.
The rapid development of particle
board, which has only been on the Aus-
tralian market six years, can be seen
from the fact that the ratio of hardboard
to particle board production was 16 to 1
in 1962-63, 7 to 1 in 1964-65, but in
the 3 months to October, 1965, the ratio
was down to only 51 to 1.
Associated Pulp’s Burnie Board pro-
duction in north-west Tasmania accounts
for about 40-45 p.c. of Australian hard-
board. It competes directly with Masonite,
produced by CSR’s wholly-owned sub-
sidary at Raymond Terrace (NSW), and
CSR's Timbrock, which has been made at
Bacchus Marsh (Vic.) since mid-1961.
Particle board is a post-war European
development, using pinewood. The pio-
neering firm here was Pyneboard Pty.
(owned jointly by CSR and APM), with
plants at Oberon (NSW) and Rosedale
(Vic.). The market is developing so satis-
factorily that another £2im. plant is
being established at Tumut (NSW) with
capacity of 2m. square yards.
Associated Pulp, which had watched
the growth of particle board as a poten-
tial competitor with hardboard in some
use areas, finally got into the act late in
1963 with Trudek flakeboaid and Wood-
lok veneered flakeboard, manufactured
near Devonport (Tas.).
The question is whether APM-CSR’s
particle board is cutting into Associated
Pulp’s primarily hardboard business, or
equally as much into CSR’s very own
Masonite and Timbrock markets.
Hardboard and particle board do com-
pete in shelving; hardboard is generally
thinner than particle board. As an ex-
ample of hardboard uses, Timbrock (with
productive capacity of some 7m. square
yards) produces half for the building
trade as wallboard, half for automotive,
electronic, furniture and other industries.
Particle board, which comes in a
variety of finishes, plain or veneered, is
used with good effect not only for cup-
boards and shelving, but for such diverse
uses as lining railway carriages, panelling
and partitioning of offices, hotels and
motels.
More than likely the burgeoning parti-
cle board industry is hitting plywood and
natural timber sales as much as hard-
board.

The Treasury’s New Tenant
Wharfies rejoice. Will taxpayers lament?
By CROESUS
A LTHOUGH he cast himself for the role many years ago, few will envy Mr William
***■ McMahon in having to enter the fiscal and monetary play as Federal Treasurer
at a time when backstage the scene has all the glitter of a Hollywood party.
What with Mr Holt, who beat him
to the Treasury post seven years ago,
becoming PM, Sir Roland Wilson get-
ting wings from Qantas and Dr H. C.
Coombs the London “Financial Times”
Oscar, the toasts are all for the old well-
performed cast. After the rough and
tumble of the labor market, even with
his new image and more mellow outlook
on life, the former Minister for Labor
and National Service will need all his
well-known aplomb (vide the wharfies)
to push his own star in this galaxy,
Let there be no mistake, though, Mc-
Mahon is highly equipped for his new
job. It is not so much that he has had
a professional training in economics (in-
deed he is the first Federal Treasurer
with this up his sleeve), but because he
has passed with honors the various
Ministerial courses in the fields most
closely bearing on economic manage-
ment. Over fifteen years or more he has
been in most of the big economic argu-
ments, either actually in Cabinet or in
the Ministerial environment.
What is more, he has usually been
prepared to discuss economic problems
with the Press and suggest lines of
thought. Going way back I recall long
discussions on his hobby horses, such as
the proliferation of Government boards
and the use of Treasury bill finance to
top up investment and effective demand.
Then, when he was Labor Minister in
the 1961-63 recession, he was equally
ready to interpret the employment
situation to me at length on the phone
after a hard day in Cabinet. Perhaps his
accessibility has diminished a bit with
increasing responsibilities, yet with an in-
telligent Press secretary (which Mr Holt
never had at the Treasury) he is not
likely to be found wanting in this respect
in his new role.
Unlike his predecessor, the new
Treasurer has rarely needed to count his
personal chips; again, however, he has
never lived it up with them as Holt has
sometimes given the impression of doing.
McMahon may have flamboyant
fetishes, yet is dedicated to his political
tasks and works endlessly at them. He
is no spendthrift. His old flat near the
“Cross” was nothing to write home
about and, at least until recently, his mode
of life was simple, almost spartan. He
knows the value of money. For all his
pet theories that adjustments to effective
demand and public investment hold the
answers on full employment, I would
predict he’ll keep a tight hold on the
nation’s purse strings.
In his capacity of Minister for Labor,
McMahon was at one remove from the
centrifugal point of economic control.
His old Department is basically more an
instrument through which Government
economic policies find reflection in the
employment figures than one, like
Treasury and Trade, where those policies
are largely formulated.
As a leading Minister, McMahon has
been influencing the final versions of
these policies in Cabinet to an extent
which has increased with the years.
Though still falling short of being a
prime instigator of economic policy, his
influence has never been greater than
in recent months as his accession ,to the
Treasurership became more and more
assured. The big difference now is that
as Treasurer he will be leading policy
along. He will put his own stamp on the
Treasury’s submissions to Cabinet and
in a wide area of administrative de-
cisions taken by the Treasury Depart-
ment his will be the last word.
This is not to say we can now expect
to see drastic changes in the direction


LA TROBE UNIVERSITY
REGISTRAR’S DEPARTMENT
La Trobe University is proceeding with the appointment of staff to assist
in the planning and development of the academic side of the University's
administration.
Applications are invited for the following positions:
ASSISTANT REGISTRARS
Three positions are available at the assistant registrar level. Applicants for these positions
should have had extensive administrative experience preferably within a University and that
they will be graduates.
One of the positions will be associated with the general academic work of the University,
and in particular the assistant registrar will be minute secretary to the Interim Council,
the Academic Planning Board and several of the committees of the Interim Council.
The second position of assistant registrar will be associated with the planning and develop-
ment of the administrative services associated with the admission of students, courses,
examinations and other student activities. Experience with mechanised procedures is a
requirement.
The third position of assistant registrar will include responsibility for general administrative
activities related to all staff, the registry and University publications.
The salary for these positions will be within the range of £3,400-£3,80Q per annum.
The University is also seeking applications for the position of:
PERSONNEL OFFICER
The University has decided to group all personnel administrative activities under the control
of an assistant registrar. The Personnel Officer will be directly responsible to the assistant
registrar for all matters associated with establishments, engagements, terms and conditions
of service, and other related matters for both academic and administrative staffs.
The salary for this position will be within the range of £2,400-£2,700 per annum.
REGISTRY OFFICER
The development of the University requires an efficient recording system and the University
wishes to appoint an officer-in-charge of the registry section who will be responsible for
all aspects of the recording and distribution of the administrative records of the University,
inward and outward mail and similar activities. The University is seeking a person who
has had extensive experience in this area and offers a salary in the range of £1,860-
£2,100 per annum.
Further details of the University's plans for development and information concerning super-
annuation and other benefits may be obtained from the University whose address is
474 St. Kilda Road, Melbourne.
Applications for these positions should be made by letter giving full relevant details
including names and addresses of three referees and a recent photograph, and should be
forwarded by Monday, 14th February, 1966, to:
Higher Appointments Office,
Department of Labour and National Service

of economic policy. The lines of current
policy are too well established and have
proved altogether too successful for that.
McMahon can be expected to urge Cab-
inet to divert them a little more this way
or that in the interests of better control
of the economy, but the Prime Minister
and his deputy Mr McEwen are unlikely
to agree lightly to big changes.
Nor would it seem at all likely, even
if Sir Roland Wilson is soon to leave
the Treasury and hand over the Secre-
tary’s post to Sir Richard Randall, that
his new Department would be a pushover
for any pet or wild ideas Mr McMahon
may have been harboring all these years
he’s been waiting at its door. Sir Richard
is much of the same mental mould as
Sir Roland and has, of course, been the
Treasury’s main thinking-piece on econ-
omic matters for a long time (even fif-
teen years ago I remember interrupting
him at his desk in East Block writing a
submission on the economy for Cabinet).
Sir Richard is better suited than Wil-
son to cope with the crystallisation of
McMahon’s power complexes at the
Treasury. At least he will know how to
compromise should any of McMahon’s
old prickly-pear attitudes be reasserted.
Wilson might have found this difficult
after being so enormously powerful him-
self all these years. He usually got his
way with the genial Harold Holt and,
before that, with the jocular Artie Fad-
den. I’m not so sure he would with the
enigmatic Bill McMahon, who may well
turn out to be the strongest Treasurer
we’ve had since homespun economist
Ben Chifley
TTow will the new Treasurer get on
iA with Dr Coombs, the gnomelike Oscar
winner, the Governor of the Reserve
Bank? This is possibly the most in-
triguing question of all. It is hard to find
much common ground in the very
diverse personalities of these two
physically small but power-packed men.
Intellectual, cultural bonds perhaps?
But here one is grasping at straws. Any-
way, it is greatly to be hoped that the
better co-operation between Treasury
and Bank in the last two years, in bring-
ing fiscal and monetary policy to bear
on the economic scene in the right time-
ly proportions, will continue.
One indiscreet injunction by Mr Mc-
Mahon to the Mar4in Place doctor
could send him scurrying off to the Old
Lady in Threadneedle Street with “The
Economist” under his arm! But it won’t
happen. I bet they get on famously
(though I once had tea with Dr Coombs
at the Bank and he didn’t seem to like
me a bit!)
Mr McMahon’s earliest grudge as
Treasurer might well be levelled at Mr
Holt himself for his soporifics on defence.
For all the latter’s recent assurances that
the defence Budget would be kept within

limits consonant with a high rate of
economic development, events could
well dictate otherwise and this could
happen very early in Mr McMahon’s
spell at the Treasury. One cannot pre-
dict the outcome (in terms of direct
spending on defence) of Mr Healy’s
talks with the new Government this
week. It is certainly conceivable that it
could mean Mr McMahon might have
to postpone any plans he may have to
relieve taxpayers of some of the
additional imposts his predecessor
clamped on in his last two Budgets.
Again, the Prime Minister assured
West Australians on his visit to
Perth last week that he intended to press
on more earnestly with northern develop-
ment, so a Cabinet decision to spend
more there could combine with defence
to restrict McMahon’s, scope for pro-
viding tax relief in the more general in-
terest of labor absorption and giving a
lift to flagging sectors of industry.
Mr McMahon said in Adelaide
before Christmas that he had certain in-
dustries under close scrutiny as falling
behind in their employment tasks, so
obviously he will be very keen, as
Treasurer, to make a positive con-
tribution to their revival, to put his
effective demand theories into practice.
In choosing his line he still has a little
time on his side on balance-of-payments
scores. But he won't be any too happy
about the rather disturbing stand-still in
savings-bank deposits in December and
the slight acceleration in cost-of-living
increases in the December quarter, though
this is not nearly as serious as some of
the dailies have been making out. He
will also have noticed the unions have
stepped up their Arbitration Commission
claims. He has a tricky matter coming up
with the forthcoming round of wage
hearings for which it is to be hoped he
can improve on the brief Mr Kerr had
from the Treasury last year.
I believe that under his lead the
Treasury will soon follow the example
of the Reserve Bank and provide a better
pay packet deal for women in the public
service and that private employers will be
encouraged to follow suit. If so, it will
not be for nothing that McMahon left
his run so late in the matrimonial stakes.
As Minister for Labor he told a
businessmen’s forum in Melbourne late
last year he saw an immense and barely-
tapped reservoir of labor among married
women and would explore ways and
means to get more of it into the work-
force pipeline. Much water has passed
under the McMahon bridge even since
then. So now to watch, as the structure
measures up to the new stresses ahead.
Wharfies may rejoice to see him depart
the labor scene. Will taxpayers lament
his lease on East Block?

MAN ON THE LAND
Improvement After Retention
New demands on free wool marketing
rTHE Committee for the Retention and Improvement of the Free Wool Market has
•*- proved its point concerning retention. Right now there appears to be a glorious
opportunity to prove its point about improvement.
India wants to buy £lO million worth
of wool, with payments spread over 10
years. India also wants the Merino ex-
port embargo lifted so that it may pur-
chase Merino rams.
When the Free Market committee
made its belated appearance to fight the
Wool Board’s reserve price plan it did
not appear particularly strong. It had
nothing like the organisational strength
of the Wool Board, its chairman was new
to the hustings and was in ill-health;
while the committee got a good Press
in Sydney this was counterbalanced by
an indifferent, to poor, Press elsewhere.
Yet one after another the seemingly
impregnable Wool Board arguments in
favor of reserve price crumbled. The
retentionists won. The defeated reserve
price adherents then claimed, and still
do, that the Free Market men were de-
void of real intention to do any im-
proving.
This observer, a protagonist rather
than a participant, gave the Wool Board
free rein with their theories. The same
is due to one particular theoretical im-
provement suggested by a free market
man, Mr Murray Clapham, manager of
Boonoke station. He suggested an altern-
ative to the reserve price plan which
contained a proposal that credit be
granted to countries such as India so
that they could purchase wool on the
free market.
As a theory this looked good. As a
tactic it was not used greatly by the Free
Market committee in the reserve price
fight, because knocking the stuffing out
of Wool Board claims concerning
alleged overseas manufacturing support
was so much simpler, and more effective.
It might now be time for a closer look
at the Clapham plan, likewise the Merino
export ban. These matters are more
closely linked than might appear.
The Free Market committee was
closely allied with the Merino Wool Cam-
paign committee. The Merino Wool
Campaign committee was largely the
creation of the late George Falkiner
Boonoke is one of the Falkiner stud
properties. Both the Free Market com-
mittee and the Merino Wool Campaign
committee are closely allied with the
NSW Graziers’ Association.
It must be shown that there is inten-
tion to improve, as well as retain, or
the recent referendum will not be the last
word on wool marketing. Unhappily
there is already a discordant note. Re-
serve price supporters are talking of get-
ting a statutory wool marketing authority
created, without a referendum, by the
Commonwealth Government.
With the retirement of Sir Robert
Menzies, the Country Party, strongly
oriented towards “orderly marketing”,
may well bring pressure to bear on the
untried Prime Minister, Mr Holt. Mr
McMahon would certainly offer resist-
ance, yet the prospect of a Holt-Mc-
Mahon rift, aided and abetted by the
Country Party (with the Labor Party
cheering from the wings), is not very
attractive.
Those reserve price supporters who are
pushing this statutory authority move
might well look beyond this question and
ask themselves just who it is they wish
to run the country. The president of the
NSW Graziers’ Association, Mr B. A.
Wright, has warned that any attempt to
create a statutory marketing authority
would be “extremely damaging” politi-
cally. He has also said that the referen-
dum result could only be interpreted as
a vote of no-confidence in the Australian
Wool Industry Conference.
Improvement then, surely, is needed
in the realm of the Wool Industry Con-

ference. How is this improvement, if it
is really intended, to be achieved?
Three months ago it appeared,, as a
ray of hope, that the NSW Graziers’
Association might come around to the
belief that an elected Wool Industry Con-
ference could be brought into being. The
Graziers’ view, on any wool matter, must
be given its due, because NSW has close
on half the sheep in the whole of Aus-
tralia. But the most recent statement on
the theory of electing the Wool Industry
Conference, instead of appointing it
from the grower organisations as at
present, from the direction of the NSW
Graziers’ is a little depressing.
The redoubtable Mr Ick Hewins, chief
executive officer, mentioned an election
system, provided there was a system of
multiple voting. Mr Ick Hewins has been
a long time in the game and it is said
that, in argument, he has never suffered
a loss. It is either a win or a stand-off.
Multiple voting, to give the biggest
grower the biggest say, sounds a bit more
like retention than improvement. Let’s
not be too dogmatic, however. There is
a little time to see how things work out,
although not too much time.
Combined with the statutory wool
marketing push, Mr Holt may run into
the old “amendment of Section 92”
headache. Sir Robert Menzies, after an
early flirtation with this one early in his
career (1937), became, in his years of
astuteness and middle-of-the-road politics,
a bulwark against tampering with Sec-
tion 92. With him it was “no go”.
To get Section 92 removed or at
least that part applying to “orderly mar-
keting” of farm produce has long
been a cherished ambition of many pri-
mary producer factions with strong
voices in the Country Party. '
AGRISEARCH
Wheat Harvesting
Losses
IjLfE in Australia take pride in our
wheat-breeding and wheat-growing
achievements. Yet a new variety or a
new cultural practice capable of raising
the average yield by a bushel to the
acre would be hailed as extraordinary.
Curiously, we have not been nearly so
concerned to ensure that all the wheat
grown in the paddock is harvested. In-
deed, harvesting losses may commonly
exceed a bushel to the acre. Because
local information appears to be scanty,
wheatgrowers should be interested in
some Canadian research on this problem.
The Canadian Department of Agri-
culture has a team of harvesting equip-
ment engineers, headed by a Mr M. E.
Dodds, at its Experimental Farm, Swift
Current, Saskatchewan. This group has
decided to separate losses at harvest time
into two categories. The first is the
natural loss in the standing crop caused
in a number of ways: by insects, birds
and animals, by inherent tendencies in
the variety to easy shedding, and by shat-
tering caused by wind and rain. The
second type of loss is mechanical, caused
by the harvesting machines. We should
possibly add spillage as a third category,
since the wheat trails leading from farm
to silo and along rail tracks from silos
to shipping ports would appear to the
casual observer to represent a consider-
able quantity of wheat.
Granted that Canadian wheats and
harvesting conditions are much different
from ours, Mr Dodds’ men have made
some disturbing discoveries that even
we should not ignore. For instance, they
found, by averaging four harvests, that
the total annual loss might often be as
high as two bushels per acre, even when
the depredations of wind and insects
were not taken into the reckoning. This
figure was compiled thus: natural loss,
0.8 bushels per acre; reel and cutter bar
loss, 0.45 bushels; pick-up loss, 0.35
bushels (in these experiments the stand-
ing crop was first cut down and then
picked up from the swath by the header,
or combine as it is called in Canada);
threshing loss, 0.5 bushels.
The natural loss is surprisingly high,
particularly since wind and insects were
not contributing agents during the test
years. The Canadians are surprised too,
and are studying this category of loss
more closely. It appears that, under their
conditions, natural loss begins when the
kernels have dried to a moisture content
of between 34 to 40 p.c. and in-
creases rapidly as the crop matures. The
Canadian practice of swathing was de-

vised partly to forestall this form of loss,
but swathing, this same research team
has shown, introduces other losses that
cancel out the advantages, except in
special circumstances and unless the
crop is cut down when the moisture
content of the grain is between 25 and-
-30 p.c. Australian oat growers occasion-
ally swath with the intention of saving
or avoiding natural loss; it would be in-
teresting to know whether this is usually
an economic precaution here.
The machinery losses can also be
shockingly high frequently up to half
a bushel at the cutter bar and another
half a bushel mostly at the straw walk-
ers. The loss at the straw walkers was
found to increase rapidly as the through-
put increases. In a heavy crop, the
walker loss alone was sometimes found
to reach several bushels per acre. As a
consequence of this well-confirmed find-
ing, the Agricultural Machinery Admin-
istration of the Saskatchewan Depart-
ment of Agriculture has recommended
that the capacity of a combine (header)
should be stated in terms of grain loss
when handling different quantities of
straw and chaff. What the Machinery
Administration seems to be saying is
that the size of a headers mouth is less
important than the size of its rear end
and the efficiency of its digestion system.
The other threshing loss which could not
be reduced to less than a tenth of a
bushel per acre at Swift Current occur-
red in the drum and in the header’s
separation system. Occasionally these
losses amounted to half a bushel per
acre when drum, draught and riddle set-
tings were not made with sufficient care.
Professor G. Vasey of the Melbourne
University’s Agriculture School has com-
pared the performance of different
headers. He, also, has found that these
harvesters are generally capable of do-
ing quite an efficient job under certain
circumstances: they should not be re-
quired to handle too much straw; the
operator, too, must be sufficiently skilled
to select the best settings, and sufficient-
ly diligent to keep changing them as
crop height, density and maturity
change, as speed of travel changes, and
as wind force and direction change.

For the Experts Only
Speculator visits an investment school
Getting most Australian investment
analysts a cash flow problem is like
giving a child a new toy. Last week the
University of Armidale was full of in-
vestment analysts with new toys.
A group of analysts from broking
houses, institutions, and even the finan-
cial Press, spent six days of last week in
Armidale’s residential summer school,
whose curriculum was based on some
Harvard Business School case studies.
And, as a seasoned speculator who has
successfully ignored most of the market
maxims of my elders and betters, I went
along too. A lot of what went on was
academic rather than practical, but the
course of studies, under Mr Peter
Davies, resulted in a very positive move
towards improving the standards of the
investment industry in general and
one speculator in particular.
Probably the most significant of these
studies related to discounted cash flows,
an investment tool not widely used here
although it does have particular applica-
tion to some local companies such as
James Hardie Asbestos a company
that has just finished raising £1 million
from the public in a new share issue.
The cash flow form of analysis showed
some striking signs of wealth at James
Hardie, with the calculations of the net
cash flow linked to the year-end book
value of plant for the last four years
highlighting its strength.
The study showed that the book value
of plant had fallen from £5.1 million
to £3.2 million since 1962, indicating
quite clearly that the company had ex-
cessively depreciated its plant by use of
its substantial cash flow. For it seems
likely that James Hardie had in fact con-
siderably expanded its operations (and
therefore its plant) during this period.
The need for establishing the correct
base on which to determine cash flow
movement was demonstrated in a study
of Johns and Waygood Ltd. While the
trend in earnings per share in the last
four years has been down, the trend in
gross cash flow per share has been up-
wards." But if gross cash flow as a ratio
u> total tangible assets is used as the
analysts’ measuring stick, then the cash
flow movement follows the same down-
ward trend as earnings per share. The
explanation for the different answers
provided by these two cash flow ratios
is the fact that the increase in reserves
and borrowings substantially exceeded
the 42 per cent increase in issued capital.
The advantages of a high cash flow,
outlined in the main paper on this sub-
ject, are mainly for providing funds for
plant replacement and expansion and
the repayment of debt. It is dangerous,
however, to accept blandly that a high
cash flow is a sure sign of growth.
Yet this would seem to be the case
in the US, where the price earnings ratios
are now so high that analysts seek such
financial indicators as cash flows to jus-
tify the high share prices. Australian
share prices have a long way to go be-
fore this sort of analysis will be in de-
mand for that sort of reason!

The Fate of the Floats
It' s not quite so easy
By JASON
Buying into new floats while the
** “stags” were selling out was a sure-
fire way of making money on the stock
exchange in the good old boom days.
Last year you would have lost your shirt.
But the moral may still be that some
of the new companies that came on to
the stock exchange lists for the first time
during 1965 are underpriced in relation
to their profits and prospects. A lack of
market knowledge of these companies—
and the fairly clear evidence that some
of them were heavily overpriced by their
underwriters on placement has meant
that trading has brought real price gains
to only a few..
Sixty-five p.c. of last year’s newcomers
are selling at prices either below or
barely on a line with their original issue
prices. Only 35 p.c. are already unques-
tioned market successes. Results from
some of these newcomers this year could
prove that these proportions do a gross
injustice to 1965’s 20 new stocks on the
Sydney list.
They do not look a bad lot, even
though some only came on to the lists for
tax purposes rather than as a result of
any real desire to get into the big time.
The seven market successes are Busi-
ness Equipment, Nuttali, Frank O’Neill,
Eglo Engineering, Ipec Insurance, Wreck-
air and Bell Bros, with O’Neill and Bell
offering greatest profits to the lucky al-
lottees. Bell's wide scope (hauling, mining
and quarrying, constructing aerodromes
and roads, grazing and agency work) ap-
peals, and earning rate moved up from
15.1 to 20.4 p.c. in 1964-65. O’Neill’s
swimming pool business is enjoying sum-
mer support (water restrictions notwith-
standing), the 36.6 p.c. earning rate is
very attractive, but this business, which
rests heavily on the luxury trade, hardly
ranks a 4.7 p.c. dividend yield.
Four companies on the list, Hilton
Bros (women’s fashions), Mr Whippy
(ice-cream vending), Vickers (heavy en-
gineering) and Stegbar (windows), ap-
pear, in retrospect, either to have pitched
fteir placement price too high or, alter-
natively, they are in the bargain base-
ment now.
Probably the best bargain in this list
ls Hilton Bros, a company in an industry
which is very unpopular with investors..
Hilton Bros is providing a massive 8 p.c.
ividend yield and a 21.6 p.c. earnings
Y'eld on a 41 p.c. earning rate that seems
Ce ffain to rise substantially this year.
There are lots of widely held reasons for
avoiding investment in fashion goods in-
dustries; most of them do not apply to
Hilton Bros.
Mr Whippy’s year has just ended. The
first half produced lower profits, due to
the cost of establishing new locations
and refitting motor vehicles, but the big
earning period is the summer. Perhaps
“Greensleeves” is irritating investors.
Vickers’ size and importance surely
justified a 7s. 6d. premium, although
earnings to capital were not dramatic.
The trend now is right, profits and orders
up. Vickers’ fortunes should be worth
following.
Stegbar, with its big interest in win-
dows, may be suffering from the home-
building decline as well as from the
fact that in the aluminium end of its
operations competition looks to be very
strong indeed and could get worse. Yet
Stegbar looks good; prior to flotation its
earning rates showed regular annual in-
creases. In the year to June, 1965, profit
moved up from £125,000 to £170,000,
although the £420,000 collected from the
placement of 600,000 shares contributed
in no way to this admirable performance.
As to those stocks hovering around
placement price, E. A. Watts is in an
industry unpopular at the moment, build-
ing-contracting. It merits a little more

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Some Doubts About Dividend
British Tobacco*s future earnings
TTnfortunately, I am writing this
article about British Tobacco Com-
pany (Australia) Limited before the
consolidated accounts for the 1964/65
year are published. This means that any
comments which I may make could be
out of date almost immediately after
they are made public. I expect that the
consolidated profit and loss account will
show some marked improvement or
there will at least be some evidence that
the group is beginning to receive bene-
fits in quite a substantial way from the
investments which have been made in
recent years. The dividend rate for
1964/65 is 11 p.c.; so far as I can see
this is the highest rate in the company’s
listed history and it is certainly the
highest rate in the last twenty-five years.
The market has responded appropriately
—the shares are currently selling at 375-9 d
9d to show an immediate dividend yield
of 5.8 p.c. from the increased 11 p.c. rate
and this is the lowest yield for at least
five years.
The question here is “What will be
future policy regarding dividend pay-
ments?” After twenty years, one increase
in the rate per cent doesn’t mean an
established practice, even if earnings
growth would permit it. From the low
base year of 1960/61, British Tobacco’s
per share earnings index compares with
two • other companies previously exam-
ined as follows:

This picture suggests that during this
period the first two gained at the ex-
pense of the last one; it is also apparent
that the one with the smallest share of
the market made the most gain. It is
also likely that by 1960/61 Rothmans
had reached a position where it was the
largest company in terms of market share
and the one at the top is usually the
loser when the little ones start to be-
come aggressive about increasing their
shares of the market.
Dividend growth indices based on the
1960/61 year unduly favor British Tob-
acco, which made a 20 p.c. reduction in
dividend in that year; the 8 p.c. paid
was the lowest rate, with the exception
of 1949/50, that had been paid during
the preceding twenty years. Nevertheless,
the per share dividend indices are as
follows:

Although tobacco is still the most im-
portant activity of the group it is
still the only Australian manufacturer
producing a complete range of tobacco
products it is fairly clear that British
Tobacco is much further advanced in
the move towards diversification than
its competitors. In this respect, it is fol-
lowing the pattern which has been set
overseas by the old-established tobacco
companies. Now, after this programme
seems to have been in operation for
about six years, the group has quite sub-
stantial interests in the printing and
packaging industry. The 1965 year has
seen quite extensive additions to the
group’s “portfolio” of interests in the
food and drink industry. Associated
Products and Distribution Pty Ltd has
acquired interests in Frozo Food Com-
pany Pty Ltd, Lionel Samson and Son
Pty Ltd, Diamond Foods Ltd, Sou’-West
Frozen Food Packers Ltd, Thomas
Playfair Pty Ltd, General Foods Cor-
poration Holdings Ltd and Toppa Hold-
ings Ltd. The printing and packaging
group consolidated its position by
acquiring further shares in Dodge Con-
solidated and the whole of the prefer-
ence capital of P. C. Grosser.
In the interim report which covered
the period to April 30, 1965, it was
stated that “In Associated Products and
Distribution Pty Ltd there is no direct
comparison with the previous year, but
generally the newly acquired companies
have realised the sales levels anticipated
at the time of purchase”. Evidently, as
many of the acquisitions listed above
were made during the second half of
the 1964/65 financial year, comparison
will again be difficult. However, so far
as the shareholders in British Tobacco
are concerned, these additional interests
are being acquired without any increase
in the issued ordinary capital of the
company. In fact, the only capital issue
made during 1965 was of £1 m. in
unsecured notes and £720,000 went
towards the conversion of maturing
notes. The only increase in the total in-
terest charge will be in respect of th e
additional raising (£21,000 approxi-
mately), because the rate of interest on
the maturing notes was the same as the
rate offered on the new notes.
Other interests, namely in the pastoral

and indoor bowling areas, are of fairly
long standing and 1965 has not been a
very propitious year for such ventures.
While the pastoral activities may be ex-
pected to recover, there must be some
serious doubt about the future of indoor
bowling in Australia.
In his last address, the chairman made
the point that W. D. and H. O. Wills
accounted for 75 p.c. of the invested
funds of the British Tobacco group. It
will be interesting to see whether any
reference is made to this subject in
this year’s address and, if so, the extent
to which the percentage has changed. It
must be remembered that, while the
acquisitions seem to be large, the pro-
portion of the British Tobacco group
can be quite small because, first, only
a controlling interest may be acquired
in the company concerned and, secondly,
if the acquisition is made by Associated'
Products and Distribution Pty Ltd, only
51 p.c. of that interest passes to the
British Tobacco group because it only
holds 51 p.c. of Associated Products.
Finally, diversification may bring
stability but it does not bring rapid
growth. Up to date, the printing and
packaging industries and the food and
drink industries seem to have been the
areas in which this diversification of
British Tobacco has been most evident.
The former industries have expanded
rapidly and the latter are regarded as
the most stable. It may well be that
British Tobacco has selected the growth
stocks within these industries for its in-
vestment and the advantages of the
association may help to reduce costs
and therefore increase profits which will
enhance the growth. Nevertheless, I
have some strong doubts whether this
will mean that the per share earnings of
British Tobacco (Australia) will grow
rapidly in the future. In fact, I doubt
whether the 10 p.c. per annum rate of
the last two years can be maintained.

A Portfolio for Sir Robert
Raising the wind to the Cinque Ports
117HILE watching Sir Robert’s little show on television the other night, I was
** intrigued to hear him say he would be devoting his time to reading, ’riting
and ’rithmetic.
Just what did he mean by ’rithmetic?
Could it be a little flutter on the market?
I immediately had visions of Sir lan
(there being no other titled stock-
brokers) getting his men to draw up “a
portfolio for Sir Robert”.
Now what would you buy Sir Robert?
There’s a competition for the Sunday
papers to start as a circulation booster
(theirs, not his). First one would have
to decide whether to plump for income
or growth, or a bit of both. Obviously
the list would have to include a few An-
setts. Perhaps some McEwens. But no
R. W. Millers, if you please, or CSRs
after that nasty Vernon Report.
In actual fact, I suppose, the port-
folio would be full of BHPs, Bank of
NSW and other good, solid stocks.
Frankly, Sir Robert, that sort of stuff is
not going to pay your fare to the Cinque
Ports too often. Join us speculators and
have a punt. I’m sure you’ll make more
money. And, besides, it’s a lot of fun.
My own fun this week began,
appropriately enough, with Canberra
Television.
This little company brings all the
pleasures of city commercial television
(Mavis, the lot) into the homes of Can-
berra, and, unlike some other television
stations, is apparently making a good
deal of money in the process. The com-
pany was formed five or six years ago,
with the “Canberra Times” and commer-
cial radio station 2CA among its prin-
cipal shareholders. Since then the
ownership of both the “Times” and 2CA
has fallen largely into the hands of John
Fairfax Limited. This gives Canberra
Television useful connections with
ATN-7 in Sydney, although it is still
part of a syndicate of country television
stations, thereby getting the best of both
worlds.
Unlike its metropolitan forebears, Can-
berra Television has no commercial
competition nor, like some of its coun-
try counterparts, does it have to contend
with any overlap from nearby stations.
The station began operating in 1962
and, after initial losses, earned a £30,000
profit in 1964. This profit was doubled
last year, a loan repaid in advance and
a maiden dividend of 8 p.c. paid. Profit
should show a further jump this year
and the dividend policy could well be
more generous. Despite this the shares
have been in the doldrums around
12s 9d. I bought 300.
To pay for them, I sold my 200
Tyree, which have also been in the dol-
drums around 19s. since I bought them
at that price three months ago.
For my other purchase this week, I
made one of my rare sorties among the
heavyweights, Union Carbide. The idea
came to me while browsing through the
list of companies proposing to celebrate
decimal currency with a share split. Of
course, there is a lot more to Union
Carbide than a share split. Each of the
main operating divisions chemicals,
plastics and batteries seems to be
flourishing these days. I am fascinated
by the potential for “Eveready” bat-
teries in the trend away from electric to
“cordless” appliances. Transistor radios
have practically replaced the old mantel
sets. Battery-driven clocks are doing
away with the electric variety. And
Union Carbide’s latest annual report
boasted about a battery-powered table
lamp. Imagine a handsome table lamp
without a disfiguring cord attached to it!
Directors have been kind to their
shareholders (and, no doubt, to them-
selves) the last two years with a 1-for-
-10 bonus each time to supplement the
10 p.c. dividend. Even so, capital is still
relatively low at little more than £2
million; over half of this is owned by
the American parent company, so that
the shares have a scarcity value. I
bought myself a modest 50 at 70s. in
the hope that they’ll be worth more than
$3.50 after C-Day.
These were paid for by disposing of
another of my static holdings, Malleys.
They were bought in November during
their memorable slide from 365. but, un-
fortunately, before they hit bottom at
265. They’ve since recovered to 28s. or
so again, but can’t seem to get any
higher.
Transactions for the week were:
BOUGHT
300 Canberra TV, 12/9 £196
50 Union Carbide, 70/- £179
SOLD
200 Tyree, 19/- £lB6
200 Malleys, 28/3 £277
The upshot of these transactions was
that I ended January out of the red and
with £142 on hand.
