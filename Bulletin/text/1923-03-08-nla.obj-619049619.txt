Walpole and His Successors
Since ignorance of the English tongue by
the first Hanoverian king led to the creation
of the office in its modern form,-, there have
been 37 Prime Ministers of England. How
many of us could name the lot? What per-
centage could name more than a dozen of
the line prior to Peel? Yet even to an Aus-
tralian some knowledge of these men should
not be worthless, for the heritage of our
race to-day is in large measure their joint
and several legacy. They were widely differ-
ent, of course in type, in mental equipment,
in purpose, in achievement. Yet they were
singularly alike in many ways, bearing that
unexplainable, elusive resemblance which
may be traced among men who rise or are
pushed to place above their fellows. Suc-
cessful soldiers and sailors, distinguished
ecclesiastics, merchants, lawyers, surgeons,
musicians, artists—the family resemblance
persists through centuries. It is impossible
to imagine two men more unlike in most
respects than Walpole and Gladstone. Wal-
pole becoming a widower at 62 promptly
married the lady who had been his “friend 5 ’
for years. It was Walpole’s pleasing cus-
tom at dinner to “always talk bawdy,” it
being in his experience the only topic that
could be freely indulged in without creating
tedium and embarrassment. Gladstone could
no more have swapped Babylonian anec-
dotes with the guests at Hawarden than he
could have sung a comic song in St. Paul’s.
Yet they were both strong, purposeful charac-
ters, with most of the good qualities of their
race, vital, enduring and masculine. Both
had the reformer’s instinct. Most of us
know something of Gladstone’s achievements
and of his failures Not many, perhaps,
know that Walpole originated the Saturday
half-holiday—in order that he might escape
from London to go hunting, a circumstance
worth remembering to-day when suburban
Gradgrinds gird at toil-worn men for “devot-
ing their weekly half-holiday to mere sport.”
With the fail of Newcastle what seemed
to be the permanent rule of the old
Whig families in England passed. That
18th century was the heyday of the dukes.
Before the Bestoration they could be counted
on a single hand. But Charles 11. made
new ones at a great rate, and there were 32
when Walpole became Prime Minister in
1721. . Pelham’s administration contained
five of them. He himself was the only Com-
moner in it, and lie was a duke’s brother.
The only Prime Minister England has known
who succeeded in leading a Ministry first as
i Whig and then as a Tory was a Duke —
Portland.. He is the Hughes of British Par-
liamentary history. From 1757 to 1783 out
of nine Prime Ministers four were dukes.
In the last hundred years only one has filled
that place. In the 18th century there were
14 Prime Ministers. Four only have left
a male line extending to the present. Three
of these were dukes. The fourth was the
second -Earl of Shelburne (afterwards the
Marquess of Lansdowne). He had the pro-
mise and his grandson the refusal of the
golden coronet.
The most distinguished family in the poli-
tical annals of England is that of the Pitts.
There was madness there and a genius that
burned. Modest in origin it gave the country
two Prime Ministers of its own name; nomi-
nated the hereditary chiefs of the houses of
Cavendish and Fitzroy ; introduced to power
its relatives the Grenvilles, and handed on
a tradition for lesser lights to profit by. For
two generations it dominated the fortunes of
England. Its policy acquired much of the
British Empire and withstood the assaults
of powerful enemies. It initiated Parlia-
mentary reform, religious tolerance and
modern finance. Under the Pitts the Tories
rose to their highest pitch of authority.
Before them the Whigs sank into oblivion
for 60 years. Chatham was a man of enor-
mous mental activity, an actor, an adver-
tiser, a tyrant and an orator of almost
unrivalled power. His son, a stern, unbend-
ing autocrat of punctilious honor, wus the
greatest genius in the management of Par-
liament that ever lived. He became Prime
Minister at 25, drank two bottles of wine a
day (Peel says so, anyway), and died at 45.
* • t^le half-century following the Peace of
Amiens 10 Tory Prime Ministers besides Pitt
led the Government. Except Stanley, who
was still in the nursery, Peel, who was at
Oxford, and Wellesley, a-soldiering, all had
been proteges of Pitt. None achieved great
celebrity, but they were able to rise to the
first position in Parliament by the tradition
ot their potent protector. Those were indeed
days. During the 50 years North,
1 itt, Addington, Grenville and Liverpool
were Prime Ministers, they must have re-
ceaved well over a million of public money.
The legacy Pitt had left was not to be
despised.

The Story of Australia
South A ustralian Land Exploration, 1856
to 1880, by Bessie Threadgill, is another
example of the very valuable work that has
been and is being done by women in the
field of Australian historical research.
Marion Phillips and Ida Lee (Mrs. Charles
Marriott) are perhaps best known in
this connection, but there are several female
members of the Royal Australian Historical
Society who have contributed papers to the
latter’s Journal that have been of the great-
est assistance to the student of the political
and geographical aspects of the story of
this continent. And the indexing done in
the Mitchell Library by women assistant
librarians—notably that of the Sydney
Gazette by Miss Ida Leeson —is one of
the library’s most useful features to those
who are studying the beginnings .of the Com-
monwealth. The women historians seem to
be specially -endowed w r ith a faculty of
laborious research into obscure sources of
history, a sort ‘of instinct for tidy catalogu-
ing of the facts they have brought to light,
and a patience and neatness in arranging
them that is not always as remarkable in
their male contemporaries in similar fields
of endeavor. _ And now Miss Threadgill has
compiled a history of a period of exploration
and development in Central Australia that
is perhaps as good an example of this pecu-
liar enthusiasm for historical research on
the part of Australian women as has yet
been printed. Her book has been published
by the Board of Governors of the Public
Library, Museum and Art Gallery of South
Australia, as the third of a series of “His-
torical Compilations upon the Studv of Ori-
ginal Documents”—and it would 'be well
if the Public Libraries of the other States
could make it one of their functions to carry
out similar good work. There, is in the
Mitchell Library of Sydney, for instance,
an accumulation of documents that ought,
for the better education of Australians in
the history of their own country, to see the
light of print.
Of the period which she has chosen for her
careful essay—one which is brilliant rather
for its minute and exact research into
the attempting and achieving of infinitely
difficult tasks than for pen-pictures of the
men wdio attempted and achieved them—
Miss Threadgill writes as folhnvs:—
The central period of Australian exploration,
especially in its early stages, is more than remark-
able. The first youth of the solitary nation was
troubled by many an Alnaschar dream, fleeting and
unsubstantial. Its mind was divided against itself
as State was pitted against State. The lure of gold
and the menace of the emancipist had severed rather
than created bonds of union' while individual in-
terest was smothering the nascent spirit of national-
ity. In one field of enterprise, however, divided
interest was making for united aim. The gold-digger
in Victoria, the pastoralist of the Moreton Bay dis-
trict and New South Wales, the Outback squatter
in South Australia or the Swan River settlement each
depended for a sphere of future enterprise on a solu-
tion of the great problem of the interior.
Up to 3856 not much had been accomplished
in opening up the' interior of the continent.
A. C. Gregory, who knew more .of it than
any of his contemporaries, wrote in that
year: “We have now sufficient data for
assuming that the remainder of the unex-
plored interior is a desert, or at least unfit
for the habitation of civilised man.” His
words were a discouragement of further
effort. “But,” writes Miss Threadgill, “hot
blood and light pockets knew no law in
the Australia of ’56. Both stimuli in every
State led to exploration effort being directed
towards a solution of the one great problem,
and of that problem South Australia held
the master key.”
So, in seven chapters comprising some
65,000 words—aided by a supplementary
volume of maps which require careful study
in order that the' reader may follow intelli-
gently a book which is by no means a volume
for an idle hour or two —Miss Threadgill
tells the story of a quarter of a century’s
strenuous effort in finding out what was to
be known and profited by in this vast and
mysterious heart of Australia. Their head-
ings give some idea of the scope of the work :
“The Gateway of the Interior,” “The West-
ern Boundary,” “Across the Continent,”
“The Northern Territory to 1570,” “The
Overland Telegraph.” “The Western Desert”-
and “East of the Overland Telegraph.” But
it is from the 13 maps showing the routes
of the explorers, the survey work for the
Overland Telegraph, and the development of
exploration at different periods that one best
realises what a mighty task was accom-
plished in the third quarter of the 19th cen-
tury by such,men as .T. McD. Stuart, A. C
Gregory, B. 11. Babbage, J. McKinlay,
Ernest Giles, John Forrest and those who
accompanied them on their various expedi-
tions. And from the bibliography printed
at the end of Part I.—which covers a list
of more than 150 MSS. journals, series of
official correspondence, printed sources, such
as Parliamentary reports and the published
voluminous reminiscences of the explorer?,
together with acres of maps—it is given to
the reader to understand what a monument
to the authoress’s patient industry is con-
tained in these two volumes.
It is not at all likely that the book will
ever be a popular one, in the sense that it
will be much read by others than those who
are serious students of Australian history
and geography. But these will find it in-
valuable, and will not hesitate to accord its
writer the praise and credit which is her
undoubted due. It is not, as.has been hinted
above, an easy book to read. The volume of
maps must be consulted constantly, and an
elaborate system of footnotes carefully read
—and footnotes are irritating things at the
best of times. But the work is arranged
in such a way as to present the reader with
the minimum of difficulties in learning what
its writer so ably teaches, and is very well

Tombs and Silent Places
When the French wanted a place to bury
their unknown soldier they chose a space
under the Arc de Triomphe. Britain had
no such site; so it laid its warrior in the
middle of the nave of Westminster Abbey.
Yet Westminster is not the nation’s pan-
theon : it cannot be even a soldiers’ pantheon
while St. Paul’s holds the dust of Nelson
and Wellington, and of Roberts. And if so
many of the great are missing from the
Abbey, so many of the little are there —for
no better reason than that they or their friends
could afford to buy the space. Its Poets’
Corner has been spared any very bad sacri-
lege ; yet in a true gathering of the immor-
tals there would not be room for Cowley
and Drayton if Keats and Shelley and Byron
had to be excluded. There is the Little
Poets’ Corner, too; Wordsworth is in it,
and thus separated from his friends Coleridge
and Southey.
But the bones of very few of them lie
here. Tennyson and Browning were buried
side by side in the Corner, and Ben Jonson
was stood upright in his grave, as he wished
—-the Abbey authorities had been very good
to “rare Ben’’ in his indigent old age. Shaks-
peare’s ashes are, of course, in the church
at Stratford ; and there is a steady pilgrim-
age that way. No town was ever more com-
pletely supnorted by one man than Strat-
ford is. Those who don’t live on the pil-
grims live on those who do. There are three
principal shrines —the cottage where the
bard was born; Anne Hathaway’s cottage,
a mile or two out of the town ; the village
church—the Collegiate Church of the Holy
Trinity, to give it its full title. Here, as in
so many other places, the visitor gets a mild
shock to find a church turned into a peep-
show with a ticket-taker at the door. Be-
side the poet are Anne, his wife; Thomas
Nash, who married the daughter of Shaks-
peare’s daughter Susanna; Susanna herself,
and Dr. Hall, her husband. The registers
contain entries of Shakspeare’s birth and
burial. The spelling of the name appears
to be various (deciphering is not easy at this
date) ; but in those days they threw in e’s
with a prodigal hand (Thomas Nash is Nashe
i,i his epitaph, and Hall is Halle), it is
not surprising to find that it is “Shake-
speare” there. The State has taken over the
birthplace and the Hathaway cottage, and
here the pilgrim pays his way, too. The
upstairs room in which the poet was born
has been autographed everywhere except on
the floor. Some of the signatures are not
easy to swallow: I can’t, for instance, pic-
ture old Thomas Carlyle scratching his name
on the window. But there it is. carefully cov-
ered over with a flake of isinglass. to pro-
tect it. The cottage where young Will found
a wife is more pretentious : the Hathaways
were people of substance. Probably because
with its thatched roof it makes a picture
much sought by the amateur photographer
you must pay an extra pound if you take
a camera within the gate that opens into
a well-kept garden. Inside they have pre-
served the Hathaway belongings as far as
possible; if they are not the actual pots and
pans that Anne used, they are at least the
pots and pans of the period. So also in the
chief hotel-resort of the devotee, the ancient
Shakspeare, they have tried to make the
place match its name. There are no num-
bers to the rooms; you sleep in the King
Lear or the Midsummer Night’s Dream,
with something in the furnishing to recall
the play. Marie Corelli has a _ vine-covered
cottage down the street: she is the living
lion of the place.
But the Caledonian has done more for
his Scott than the Sassenach for his Shak-
speare. Edinburgh has its Scott. Memorial in
the most commanding place in its finest
street —the Empire’s finest, the proud Edin-
burgher will insist. And at Glasgow the
novelist is set high above all others in the
square that fronts the municipal buildings
—and they probably are the finest in the
Empire—with sovereigns and soldiers and
scientists set around him. Perhaps there
are fewer pilgrims to the novelist’s tomb
amid the ruins of Dryburgli Abbey than to
“Scott’s country.” Both at Dryburgh and
at Melrose the British Works Department,
struggling to find jobs for the unemployed,
has been doing a good deal of excavating and
restoring. But it is not intended that they
shall be anything but the shattered wrecks
they are. The Scot, hating to waste any-
thing, has long since taken away and put
into other buildings the stones that time and
Cromwell’s men cast down.
There is quite another class of pilgrims
to the Lakes. The American has adopted
Shakspeare and Scott —almost claims them,
in fact, and has made more than one offer
for the purchase of Shakspeare’s birthplace
with a view to its removal to New York
or thereabouts. It is in the Lakes country
that England’s own literary tourist takes
his recreation: you can scarcely move there
in “the season” without meeting a . clerical
collar. Its owner can be an antiquarian
here as well as a literary devotee. There
is history in the very names of the villages.
Going from Southey’s old home (his grave
is near by) to Wordsworth’s birthplace. you
come to Portinscale. On Derwent Hill the
Vikings who came across to England and
made this part of it their own held their
Thing or Parliament. There was a ford, or
north, over the Derwent by which the Vik-
ing M’s.P. went to their duties. And along-
side the ford or porth of the Thing, a few
huts, or scales, were built for their accommo-
dation. So you get Portinscale —the huts by
the ford of the Thing.
And ruins, ruins everywhere! Somebody
lmilded, somebody else came and destroyed.
We think we are suffering from war as the
world never suffered before. Certainly the
area of suffering is wider; but that is all.
How desperately bad the state of things was
thought to be in other times you can judge
hv the steps that were t* llro n to charge it.
Far up in Scotland you find at on" end
of what is now the Caledonian Canal the
ruins of Fort William; at the other end a
monastery has taken the place of Fort
Augustus. Besides constructing great high-
ways—Wade’s roads—Cromwell built these
two strong forts the better to tranquilise
the turbulent Highlanders. And farther
south, starting from Chester —which haa
done more to preserve the old Roman for-
tifications than any other city in Britain —
Hadrian built a great wall which ran down
to Hereford to keep back the turbulent
Welshmen. For their greater encouragement
he decreed that any Welshman caught east
of the wall should iose his right hand. But
times have changed. The Welshman may
move east now and run no risk of losing his
tongue even though he lose his head.
S. H. P.
An Australian Academy
“D.M.W.’s” complaint (B. 15/2/’23) of the
lack of encouragement given to Australian
writers is well founded. But this applies
not only to writers. It is the same even
with blood horses. And when Australians
neglect their own horses, how much more
will they do it to their literary folk?
Every real horsebreeder knows that Aus-
tralian-bred horses have proved themselves
quite as successful sires as imported ones.
Yet imported sires are almost always given
the preference by breeders. Why this should
be no one can explain. In literature there
is more reason apparent for such prefer-
ence. It is not that the stuff produced is
not good enough. It is merely that most
readers are always looking for new sensa-
tions. They get these more easily from out-
side sources. Few of them really know any-
thing about Australia. They are just suffi-
ciently in touch with it for it to have lost
the appeal of novelty. They are not suffi-
ciently acquainted with it to feel the in-
terest* of intimacy. As a natural result Aus-
tralian literature has a poor market in its
own country, and the overseas possibilities
have never'yet been properly exploited.
Foreign matter, especially Yankee stuff,
gives a new fillip. Readers flatter them-
selves that they are learning something new.
At least, they experience new sensations.
The Yankee writers see to that. The aver-
age reader likes his spirits raw. The result
is the flood of American books (and pic-
tures) that threatens to drown all true Aus-
tralian productions. The American knows
that the wild-west novel is not truly Yankee.
The average Australian does not; he simply
swallows it. The English and French litera-
ture most avidly read in Australia is, gener-
ally speaking, by no means the best or most
characteristic of either country. It is the
over-colored stuff that sells, the productions
that give a passing stimulus to emotions,
generally of a spurious kind.
The source of a good deal of the trouble
can be traced to our reviewers. When books
with a distinctly Australian atmosphere are
produced, they are treated almost exactly
like oversea productions. Read the notices
of Australian and other books in the same
column. We could learn a lot in this direc-
tion from America. There it is local atmo-
sphere first, good literature second. This
attitude can, of course, easily be overdone.
Nevertheless, it would not hurt the review-
ers, nor the journals in which those reviews
appear, to give a fuller and more under-
standing notice of Australian matter. What
“D.M.W.” says is quite true; we certainly
have here writers who are at least the equal
of those whose stuff is pouring in from over-
seas in a manner which overwhelms the
local article. What is the remedy? Appa-
rently nothing but the slow process of time
and development of an Australian spirit.
Meanwhile, our writers must just go on
suffering neglect, with that suffering height-
ened by the grim knowledge that others no
more worthy are reaping the gains that
should be theirs, There is little chance of
any remedy from a business point of view,
for the degree to which a person is a good
writer is almost always the exact balance
of his or her lack of business capacitv. Who,
then, will run the proposed academy?
W. M. FLEMING.
The Journalist
Frank Morton in reply:—
Somebody “from a pressman’s desk” replies
(1 5 / 2 /’ 23 ) to my brief and cordial, note on changed
conditions published a fortnight earlier. I needn't
sa y niuch in rejoinder to my “pressman” friend,
w ho has all the creaking and squeaking tricks
0 f the machine. The thing I am most inclined to
say> and to let him go at that, is that at this
advanced stage of my senile decay I can look
back with satisfaction to the fact that I never
attacked another man from cover. When I write
anything that may seem to reflect on any other
person, I invariably set my name to what I write,
And what a whale our “pressman” is for assump-
tions! “I am certain that in the hurly-burly of
that part of daily journalism devoted to the pre-
paration of reliable, water-tight ‘news’ Morton would
scarcely be worth having on the premises.” There
are good men and true on half-a-dozen honest news-
papers who could tell him something about that.
one of my sorrows over the new young men of
the press is that their methods are so rotten
a nd their work, in the net result, so bad. As to
the average of the reporters I find about me now,
1 a m convinced that there were better news-getters
i n the ark with Noah, though I myself was a very
young man then.
if the A.J.A. cares nothing for the quality and
tone of the work its members do—<if it cares not
at all what feint they make of earning the wages
they exact—then must the A.J.A. be damned past
remedy in the estimate of all decent men.
All the twaddle that is talked about the dreadful
sweating that went on in past days leaves me cold.
I have served many Australian papers as a reporter,
and I cannot remember that I was ever badly treated
by any one of them, though my own treatment of
some of them was damned bad. Having regard
to the changed value of currency, I was quite as
well paid when I was a reporter in the First Stoic
Age as any of these omniscient cubs are now. My
point is simply that, while the pay of the re
porters has gone up and up, the pay of the writers
who alone count for anything in letters has remained
where it was. If my “pressman” friend is satisfied
with that, he has queer ideas of justice,
I am asked what reporters can do to improve
newspapers. The answer is obvious: they can im-
prove reporting. They can labor, with however des-
perate faith, to write a passable sort of English,
and to avoid the grosser sorts of vulgarity in print.
They can strive to keep themselves reasonably con-
versant with the ideas and movements and events
of tlie world, to the end that when they get up a
step they may not write the dither about inter-
national quesions that is being published ad nauseam
by Australian papers now.
As to the silly talk of me as a slanderer of honest
tradesmen, a discourager of young ability—oh, la,
la! I am almost frantically anxiou3 to find and
encourage young ability, were it only for the reason
that I select and publish month by month some
original matter written by others, and I know how
barren a field Australia has become. There is a
constant stream of young writers passing through •
my house, and the old fogey that I am is on the
happiest terms with all of them. I have for years
back had almost constantly to fight people who
have come protesting to me that this young writer
or that was unworthy of print. I have young
writers, including a considerable number of young
reporters, writing to me often, asking my opinion-
on work submitted, inviting my advice, even ad-
mitting that perchance I, too, may know something—
reporters, mind you 1
I do not for a moment believe that the public
of Australia is so grossly illiterate as the news-
papers assume. I think that there are tens of thou-
sands of good Australians heartily sick of the blood-
spot on the floor and the tedious unpleasantness of
our inferior criminal class. But improvement must
be from the bottom up. A better class of reporting
means a better sort of newspaper. The present sort
of reporting is dreadfully bad, whatever our
mechanic may think. We have an example
of its badness in one or two new weeklies
that have recently appeared, written en-
tirely in reporters’ English, doomed from birth.
One weekly, it is true, has succeeded; but it has
succeeded because it pays high salaries to an ex-
ceptional staff and high rates to whatever contri-
butors can get the knack of writing down to ’t3
requirements.
Let me say a word for the despised race of
newspaper-proprietors, although God knows I owe
such gentry nothing. They are a people of poor
mentality and debased morals, but they are human
and respectable. They don’t spend ninepence when
they can make sixpence do. If they are slow to
recognise any special merit in the young fellows
of their staffs, it is simply because they can get
whatever literary matter they want by the respect-
able old plan of stealing it. If the A.J.A. took
up the subject of copyright, gathered to its fold
all the writers of Australia, and so came down like
a hammer of God on any paper that infringed a
writer’s copyright, then the godly editors would
find stealing a profitless and costly game, and the
reporter with honest ambitions and some ability would
see his prospects widen and become glad. Similarly,
the A.J.A. might, with advantage, lay it down as a
fixed rule that no Australian writer shall assail, pester,
or slander any other Australian writer otherwise
than over his own name. I don’t think that all matter
in newspapers should be signed. 1 think it is
stupidity to sign political articles, because politicians
are the scum of the earth at best and anything
is good enough for them. But I do think —I feel
very strongly—that anything in the nature of an
attack on a private person, any criticism by one
writer of another, should be signed by its author.
For the rest, my “pressman” friend has not hurt
my feelings in the least. He has written some
that is stupid, and much that is not true; hut -he
has plainly no personal knowledge of me, and he
has as good title to his bland opinions as any that
may accrue to the silly ass who, on the warrant
of my verses in this and other papers, holds that
I spend all my leisure in the trapping and be-
trayal of genteel spinsters. If I am exasperated
by the reporter-class in any way, it is simply be-
cause I feel that it is a very important thing
just now to maintain such standard of merit in
journalism as up till now we have attained.
Compare “Taps” (B. 15/2/’23), his manner, his
style, his humor, with “Pressman,” and my point
is largely proved. “Taps” humbles me by his too-
cordial praise of something I have written, it is
true; but the new young chap, the “pressman,”
never seems to admit that another fellow can write
anything worth while —he nourishes nothing un-
profitable as an unselfish enthusiasm. “Taps” is
of the older time and the older School —the distant
time when we writers were not afraid to admiie
Whatever was good in each other.
As for sweating in the old time. As to hours
of work, maybe; but I never did care how many
hours I worked, and don’t care now. But as to
salary—well, £4 a week 25 years ago had
a higher purchasing value than £8 has now. Cer-
tainly we all seemed to have more money then, and
spent it more freely. But there is no sense in
laboring these points. I still think that it should
be a qualification essential in every reporter that
he shall write reasonably good and correct English.
I think, too, that he should know something of
politics (on the large scale), books, history, move-
ments, and the general life of the world. I may be
wrong, but if I am wrong—well, dammit, I’m at
least sincere.

So another £3OOO
went into the flame.
HE walked into the office of
the Alexander Hamilton
Institute late one day and
enrolled for the Modern Busi-
ness Course and Service.
“Too bad I didn’t do this two
years ago,’’ he said, “it would
have saved me £3OOO.
“It took me a long time to get
that £3OOO together,’’ he con-
tinued, “almost five years of
hard work and rigid economy.
And it lasted just exactly six
months after I set up in business
for myself. You have a lecture
in your Modern Business Course
—something about organising a
successful business.’’
“Oh, yes,’’ said the Institute
man, “you mean ‘The Essentials
of a Successful Enterprise.’
“That’s it,” he replied. “I
picked up that Lecture in a
friend’s home the other night. . .
It’s a bitter thing to confess, but
it’s true —if I had had just that
single Lecture, just that tiny
fraction of your Course and
Service 1 would be £3OOO richer
to-day.”
He held out his hand.
“I’m glad to be enrolled,” he
concluded. “But tell me, if you
can, why didn’t I do it two years
ago?
******
IN a home in a New England
city a man and his wife sat
discussing the Modern Busi-
ness Course and Service. And
while he hesitated, she leaned
across the table and spoke:
“Just think, John,” she said,
u You have been where you are
for more than fourteen years,"
The flame that consumes the
lives of men; that licks up
businesses and devours the
hopes of millions of homes.
All men contribute some-
thing to feed that flame; some
men contribute everything;
for the flame is Indecision.
“Fourteen years of petty
salary increases and hopes de-
ferred—of expecting always that
next year would bring the oppor-
tunity that has never come.’’
“How can you hesitate?’’ she
demanded, “you ought to have
enrolled ten years ago.’’
******
IN an office a vigorous man of
thirty-four filled in his enrol-
ment blank and pushed it
across the desk with a smile.
Then rummaging around in the
top drawer he produced a faded
coupon and held it up.
1 clipped that from one of
your advertisements in 1917 and
never sent it in,’’ he said to the
Institute representative. “I
have just one criticism of you
folks. Why don’t you say
something in your advertising
that would tell a man plainly
what a fool he is to ‘put it off’?’’
The sad procession of wasted
years.
In that single paragraph he
summed up the whole problem
of the Alexander Hamilton In-
stitute.
The facts about the Institute
are known to thousands of
ambitious men.
Many a man, seeing the pro-
gress these others have made,
says:
Some day I will investigate
that training for myself.”
But he puts it off, and the days
lengthen into months and the
months into years.
Are you such a man? Are
you one who is paying for this
training without receiving its
benefits? Paying in opportuni-
ties that pass you by because
you have not the courage to reach
out and make them your own ?
Paying in years of routine pro-
gress when the progress might
be swift and sure? Paying in
the most precious currency in the
world—the hopes you have built
for the future of your wife and
your children and home?
Will you, in justice to yourself
and to them, spend one single
evening with the facts? The
facts have been condensed for
busy men into a 1 20-page book,
Forging Ahead in Business.”
It tells just what the Modern
Business Course and Service is
and does; just how it has been
used by men whose position and
problem were precisely like
yours. Will you ‘‘put it off”?
Or will you clip the coupon
and post it now?

SINGLE-SIX
SPORT
To speak of the Packard Single Six is
to speak of a car which even, in the short
space of time since its importation, has
opened up a new era for the Australian
motorist.
To travel in this new Packard is to realise
the entirely new and momentous meaning
which Packard has given to the phrase
"ease of control.”
From a stand, the gentle, almost imper-
ceptible shift through first and second
gears to third takes place within the car’s
own length, and thereafter the pick-up
in third is instantaneous, smooth and
powerful.
This new Packard Single Six has practi-
cally eliminated the use of gear-shift and
clutch.
From a gait of two miles an hour in top,
this new Packard will ascend the steepest
grade with an ease and grace almost
incredible.
So long as the Single Six is just turning
over, a shift out of high-gear is unneces-
sary, and the pick-up is vigorous and easy
smooth and strong.
Here is a steady flow of power which
possesses all the advantages of electric
current for accessiblity and flexibility.
This is one of many super-features which
make the Packard Single Six a car of in-
comparable value.
Big shipments have just arrived from
America and we can deliver these new
cars immediately at reduced prices.

Arafura Nights.
I love the northern nights, and the wild cries
Of birds unknown to me, the bark of dogs
Where few dogs are, the dismal croak of
frogs
By dark, uneasy rivers, and the sighs
The jungle breathes, like a lost soul that
dies,
As by the Arafura Sea I dream
Of cities far away, catching the gleam
Of native teeth, the flash of native eyes.
Cold grasses on the near-by burial-grounds
Stir with a fevered, slow solemnity
Beneath the stars ; and softly over the sea
Comes music, then the baying of great hounds
Untamed, unkenneled. .. . till the soul of me,
Grown grand, primordial, trembles at the
sounds!

Dead Flowers.
Though, through shine and shadow,
Honey-eaters flit,
Where’s the pink boronia —
What’s become of it?
Dead is gold December,
Gone its lights that shone —
Who shall find boronia
Now December’s gone?
Tell me, all ye rovers,
Rovers young and old,
Where is now the W’attle-bloom
And its drooping gold?
Sped is sweet September,
All its glory fled—
Who shall gather wattle-gold
Now September’s sped?
Yet within the forest
Nothing, nothing grieves,
Neither are there dewy tears
On the red-gum’s leaves;
Though we see flowers perish,
Yet, in time re-born,
Since we’ll see them bloom again
Wherefore should we mourn?

The Green Fan.
The first great leaf that swung
Over the soft face of a sleeping child
Whispered the green protection of the tree
To sway betwixt it and the burning sun;
But that silk fan between your fingers held
Offers to me no shielding from the light
Of your enticing eyes; rather it makes
An invitation to the sunny lips
Whose petalled scarlet dares the bee to sip!
Did some Cellini plan those thin gilt sticks?
And did some haughty, pouting Pompadour
First ply them to confuse a monarch’s wits?
Or an Unknown, with velvet mask to hide
The elfin nose and arching sepia brows.
Evoke a duel when she dropped the fan
Gallants would scramble for? I think some-
how
A whiff of patchouli drifts from As folds.
That small, dark stain may have been noble
blood,
Drawn in some shady garden of the Court
By a quick rapier at a ruffled wrist!

Arcady.
I’d like to watch the centaurs play
All through a bright and windy day,
And rear, and light, and prance.
My limbs upon a lawn of grass
Would feel the thudding horse-hoofs pass
Aloof from all mischance.
There would be craggy mountains there
Of rose-red rocks, all stark and bare,
And lawns of lizard-green ;
bathing-pool as dark as jade,
With virgin lilies overlaid;
A grove of sombre mien—
A very sacred midnight grove.
Wherein, if one should softly rove,
The heart would hold its breath—
A place of most delicious fear,
For noiseless, tall wood-gods draw near
Stone altars pale as death.
I’d have a wood-god for my love.
With midn'ght black of trees above
He would be dark, serene.
With close, kind arms, and carven lips,
A leopard-skin to gird his hips.
But out in sunlight keen
A dappled centaur stamps his feet,
And I have found his strength so sweet
I cannot choose but ride
Triumphant on his hollow back,
While all his fellows, brown and black,
Range close on either side.
Oh, but the female centaurs rear,
With narrowed glances, like a spear.
Straight-flung to wound or slay!
My centaur spurns the tender meads;
I grip his sides; no more he heeds
The loves of such as they.
Oh, headlong hoofs! Oh, singing air!
Oh. arms uptossed and scattered hair!
Oh, snow-white waterfalls!
Life is a shout, a cry, a song—
Oh. dappled flanks so swift and strong
’Neath rosy mountain walls!
I wed myself to lusty things.
M ’ life has taken falcon’s wings,
Love’s mouth tastes sharp of blood;
But in the dark and sacred place
That other love with shadowed face
Waits where the ring-doves brood.
Oh, breast as steadfast as earth’s breast!
Here shall I find my certain rest.
As day at length finds night.
The trane&d, changeless gloom is good
Here, in the middle of the wood,
Whose altars glimmer wh'te.

OUR DISCREDITED INSTITUTIONS.
One of the things that have kept the British
Empire freer from involution than any other
has been a belief on the part of the poor
of all races and exceeds in the integrity of
certain great institutions. Victoria, the
Great AVhite Queen, who loved her faithful
niggers like a mother; the Churches, re-
garded as exponents of the CHRiST-inspired
ideal of peace on earth and goodwill amongst
men; Parliament as a medium for effectuat-
ing a people’s will and the Press as a
medium for expressing it; the great profes-
sions as bodies with a high standard of
honor—the claims to public regard, even
veneration, made for all these have been
granted, without many qualifications. On
the whole they deserved it. What can be
finei% to take only one instance, than the
record of those civil servants who for the
past half-century have administered Bri-
tain’s 10 million square miles of territoi-y
in Asia and Africa? They made their mis-
takes, of course, but their work stands as
a world’s record of what probity and per-
sonality can accomplish without any great
display of force. A degenerative process
began all over the Empire dui'ing the wai\
Wlio now thinks of the House of Commons
in terms of the Gladstonian era? In the
last few weeks a British Royal Commission
has found that “honors” were sold whole-
sale by both the great parties, and has indi-
cated (though it l-efrained from actually stat-.
ing) its opinion that the ex-Ministers who
came before it and denied that they knew
what was going on were liars; an ex-Min-
ister has sold to the press a book of remin-
iscences which have been declared by high
legal authorities to be in contravention of
his Privy Councillor’s oath; and an ex-
Prime Minister has been involved in a
sordid wrangle in the U.S.A. between the
llearst papers and a syndicate representing
the Opposition press over the publication of
his Memoirs.
N. S. Wales provides an example on a
small scale of a phenomenon which may be
duplicated, roughly, in most parts of the
Empire. Its pubLc has become cynical about
its institutions. And with good reason.
Never was the Assembly more unsavory in
manners and morals (the once Spartan
Labor party is a by-word for corruption
even amongst Laborites) ; and never was the
Council lower in prestige. Many of the
leaders of the Christian churches, far from
obeying their Master’s precept in regard to
bringing men together in a spirit of amity,
devote such abilities as they possess to the
obviously congenial job of stirring up sec-
tarian and racial hatred. The pre-war Press
had its defects ; but most of it was written
in English, it boasted a sense of humor and
proportion, and it catered less for the crim-
inal than for any other class. A growing
number of papers to-day say what they
have to say in bastard American; their
humor is purloined Yankee humor; the very
photographs of half-naked chorus-girls and
painted film-actors which most of them pub-
lish are American ; they specialise in rape and
murder cases, yet set themselves up as moral
reformers in emulation of William Ran-
dolph llearst —though without Hearst’s
redeeming habit of canting with his tongue
in his cheek. In its last issue the
Medical Journal of Australia, which is
the official organ of the local branch of the
8.M.A., published one of its periodical lead-
ers on medical ethics. From beginning to
end the only “infamous conduct in a profes-
sional resp’ect” that the paper dealt with
was the practice of self-advertising. What
is the public, which knows of genuinely in-
famous medical practices in almost every
Sydney suburb, to think of this but that the
B.M.A. authorities, who are prominent
enough not to need advertisement, are more
concerned with the business of keeping their
younger rivals down than with the duty of
raising the standard of their profession up?
About 90 per cent, of the doctors who have
been thrown out of the B.M.A. in N. S.
Wales in the past 10 years were proceeded
against for accepting smaller lodge fees than
the prosperous heads of the profession said
might be accepted. How many have been
proceeded against as abortionists or drunk-
ards? The legal profession is sensitive of
its good repute where erring attorneys with-
out financial or social influence are
concerned. And it has a formidable in-
strument ready to deal instantly with soli-
citor offenders in the shape of the Supreme
Court. But when a prosperous attorney,
or an attorney who has friends in high
places, breaks nearly every commandment
of the legal decalogue, the authorities, l'ke the
noble infant of melodrama when questioned
about the corpse that has been attributed
to her sainted mother, are capable of pro-
fessing sturdily that they have “seen no-
thing, heard nothing,’’ though the reports of
sworn evidence have been in all the papers.
It is futile to point to a public calamity
without at the same time pointing to a pos-
sible cure or, anyhow, to the probable or gin
of the trouble. In this paper’s opinion the
wave of disillusion which is acting and re-
acting disastrously on many once-honored
institutions is the work at bottom of the
War Precautions Act. The immediate effect
of the measure was to bring about a lowered
political moral. Men in high positions were
responsible only to Hughes, and Hughes
was responsible to nobody. A craving for
money is dangerous, from the nation’s stand-
point, in a public man, and a craving for
absolute power, where there is any prospect
of its beino- realised, is a thousand tim°s
more so. Hughes had this failing. His
heelers, official and social, became suspect
from the moment the taxpayers grasped the
first principles of government by rescript
and proclamation—which was the system
Australia groaned under from the birth of
Nationalism till several years after the
Armistice—and the financial leaps that have
been accomplished by most of Hughes’s
friends in the last few years only go to show
how well based the original public anxiety
was. Illegality (and the War Precautions
Act was no more legal, in the true sense,
than Martial Law) begets illegality; and
when the thing is manifest on the topmost
branches of the tree of State, it may soon
be observed on the lower ones. The inde-
cently acquisitive spirit that grew more and
more flagrant as the war dragged on was
acquired by pretty well all classes. But this
kind of spirit called for a peculiar type of
politician, a peculiar type of press, a peculiar
type of city alderman, a peculiar type of
ecclesiastic, a peculiar type of lawyer. They
duly came to the top. and we have many of
them with us still. In some cases they are
men who, before war taught them them that
a disregard for the rights of others mav be
presented from a platform as a high form of
patriotism, were straight-going, fair-minded
citizens; in other cases they are men whom
the new conditions threw up—such banditti
as are always attracted by the prospect of
loot. They believe profoundly in the rights
of the top dog. They consider that members
of the financial or officer class can do no
wrong, and that the indigent or private sol-
dier-citizen is an extremely dangerous fel-
low. Him they punish for the good of the
nation; the officer they reward in ways
which are much the same in peace as they
were in war. .Hughes’s £25 000 gift fit-
tingly symbolises the period that evoked it.
It stands for a slackened political fibre, lax
business principles and a lowered moral
amongst the professional and religious
classes that have condoned it. As a first
essential to getting back to the pre-war atti-
tude towards those great institutions on
whose moral health and good repute the
maintenance of law and order depends, it
will be necessary to break away from the
arrogant and unscrupulous war-time noint of
view. That is only to say, really, that we
must get rid of our war-time leaders^— mot
merely in politics, but in commerce, in the
churches, in the Law and elsewhere. The
jettisoning of Hughes is but the first move
in a reform movement that should be as
big as the pernicious system he created.
IN THE “NEAR EAST.”
Lenin, wlio travels under an alias, is sup-
posed to be disabled and out of the front line,
so Trotsky, who has at least the merit, such
as it is, of having been born Trotsky, takes
up more space. The Jew chemist’s son has
always been regarded as representing the
war party in the self-appointed Government
of “Commissaries,” therefore no one is much
surprised at the statement ascribed to him
that war has “become a necessity” to his
bedevilled country. Russia possesses the biggest
paper army in the world, if not the biggest
in history, and it is supposed to possess the
biggest real army in existence. The force
is, moreover, said to be better trained than is
common with Russian armies. If it isn’t it
is difficult to imagine what has become of
the thousands of disbanded Hun officers —
men who knew no trade but war, and who
had no place save Russia to go to, and who
might as well be living on Russian paper
money as on Hun paper money. There is
always need to find occasional employment
for an overgrown army if it is to be kept
out of mischief. Employment is the only
thing such an army is for, sooner or later,
and in a country where the voting classes
are artisans, peasants and soldiers, all the
learned and peaceful professions being dis-
qualified, militarism must almost inevitably
develop. If a good part of the Russian Army
could live for a while in free quarters abroad
it would be a relief to the straitened and
cannibalistic finances, for, barring the plunder
of poor little Bokhara, nothing has been done
in foreign enterprise of a martial kind for a
long while. A good many of the officers are
probably as anxious for war as they were
when they were the Kaiser’s officers in 1914
—more so, indeed, since a French army is
now collecting arrears of Hun indemnity on
Hun soil, and that wasn’t the case in
1914. The opportunity for stirring up
Germany, and roping it in as a Bol-
shevik satellite, looks promising at this
distance, whatever it may look like at
shorter range. There would be no small
accession of prestige and wealth for the Bol-
shevik Administration if it recovered some
of the 500,000 square miles of territory and
the 65,000,000 subjects which it lost to Ger-
many without striking a blow, when that
Administration, in its frisky .youth, thought
it could get out of a war simply by dis-
banding its army, and saying it was out. As
the Hun promptly lost all that vast plunder
to the Allies, who set the little nations up
in business for themselves, he would have
no qualms about helping Russia in this
matter. Taking one thing with another, if
Trotsky is still the unpacified Bolshevik, he
may well consider that it is time a new start
was made at spreading the gospel.
The cabled narrative is that Trotsky has
offered Russian aid to the Lithuanian renublic
in its scrambling disagreement with the
Polish republic, and if, in the course of the
trouble, the Soviet legions marched across
Poland, they would be in more or less friendly
contact with the Germans, who are in un-
friendly contact with the French. The pos-
sibilities are thus enormous, and much de-
pends on whether Trotsky is a Napoleon
or a sky-rocket. In their honest desire to
free oppressed nationalities and do justice
to the little peoples, the Allies helped'to set
up quite a drove of minor States which may
keep the League of Nations busy in saving
them from big enemies and from' each other.
These are recent additions to the European
family :

Seven of them are smaller than Tasmania,
and 11 are smaller than Victoria, so they
are likely to require a good deal of help one
of these days, and to be a serious responsi-
bility to their parents and guardians. The
old independent baby-States of Europe were
Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein and
Andorra, respectively 8, 33, 60 and 175 square
miles. But they are sheltered, and each has
a powerful friend alongside. The new lot
are rather out in the open. Some of them
have no separate national character, and are
temporary-looking contrivances. Danzig and
Memel exist to save the trouble of deciding
between rival claimants. Fiume should be-
long to Yugo-Serbia, but a flashy Italian
poet went filibustering there, and kept on
performing till the usual compromise was
reached, so that there is another helpless
infant to be dry-nursed. A number of the
new States excite unpleasantness in two
quarters. The Russian grievance is that its
feckless. Soviet Government lost them, and
did it in a way which made even a tired
world laugh. And Germany’s grievance is
that it lost them in turn almost as soon as
they were acquired. The setting up of
Memel as a sort of neutral State deprived
Lithuania of the ownership, but not the use,
of its seaport; and Lithuania, which is three-
fourths the size of Victoria and possibly
thinks itself larger, has been making trouble
about the matter. Hence Trotsky’s offer
to take a hand and set Europe on fire again.
* * *
One good deed in a very mixed world is
the proposal of certain Allies to try if Aus-
tria can be set on its .pathetic old feet again.
The two-headed empire, before it went on
its ill-starred thieving expedition against
Serbia m 1914, covered 241,195 square miles
—about 30,766 square miles being the ori-
ginal German Austria, and the other 210.000
miles representing the territories of about
18 mixed races, acquired by marriage dip-
lomacy or plain theft. The lack of any’ com-
mon bond, in speech, religion or race, among
the mixed peoples enabled the small province
to hold the big empire till the crash came.
Then the mixtures were told that they could
leave and set. up for themselves if they liked
and they left. Nobody tried seriously to
collect an indemnity from Austria, despite
its sins, gnd hardly anybody even said a hard
word to it, but it collapsed all the same It
was left with an area a shade larger than
Ann T^ n l‘? nia; aad a Population of
6.000.000. Of these nerly 2.000,000 lived in
the big capital which had lost its job—the
only job it ever knew. A million or a little
more of the peonle were civil servants and
their families. There was no empire left to
serve, civilly or otherwise, and the seceded
races flatly refused to take over the old Ger-
man bureaucracy at any price. Gigantic
railway workshops, built because the Govern-
ment had the familiar Australian vice of cen-
tralisation, became a d«ad loss when nearly
tliree-fourtlis of the railways became foreign
concerns. So did the imperial munition
works. In fact, industry in general took up
its bed and walked. The new Government
droned along, paying its horde of dependants
in paper till paper ceased to have a value,
and playing the decayed aristocrat and hope-
less elderly valetudinarian to perfection. But
at last deaths became to births in the propor-
tion of 150 to 100, so the dying nation hung
out a distress signal, and four of her prin-
cipal enemies agreed to come to the rescue
with an advance of £32,500,000, and expert
advice about boiling down the host of derelict
officials, or otherwise putting them to some
use. Even Bohemia undertakes to raise 6$
millions for its old oppressor. After all,
then, despite Bolshevism and other crimes,
the world isn’t quite a hopeless place.
THE TRIBE OF FITZDOODLE.
On one of our seven-and-seventy plagues:—
One of the mysterious features of the Australian
system of government is the excessive importance
acquired in recent times by Fitzdoodle, the private
secretary. There are 63 Ministers in the six capitals,
and nearly all of theiji possess Fitzdoodles. Tha
Labor leader in the House of lteps. also has a Fitz-
doodlb to himself; so have the Cocky leader and
the leader of the Senate Opposition, which Opposi-
tion for two years consisted of one man. And there
are Fitzdoodles galore in the seven gubernatorial
entourages and in the multitude of departments
created or expanded during the Hughes regime—
Shipbuilding, Northern Territory, Munitions, Navi-
gation, Seienc'e and Industry, Commerce and Indus-
try, Works and Railways, and the Lord knows how
many more. Likewise, there are satellite Fitzdoodles
revolving round planetary Fitzdoodles who, having
made themselves useful to their Ministerial patrons
by happily combining the functions of valet and office-
boy, have been promoted over the heads of men
with far greater qualifications and length of service—
a standing grievance in all the Australian establish-
ments —or have surrounded themselves with depart-
ments of their own.
The earliest of the Commonwealth Fitzdoodles
was Arthur Atlee Hunt. A clerk in the N. S.
Wales Lands Department, and after that a barrister,
he became Barton's private secretary, and, four
months later, was made secretary and permanent
head of the Department of External Affairs. He now
has the light and genteel job of Public Service Arbi-
trator at £2OOO p.a. After Hunt came Malcolm
Lindsay Shepherd, sometime a clerk in the Sydney
G.P.O. Before Shepherd arrived the different Prime
Ministers had been content with a mere office, but
Fisher metamorphosed it into a grandiose depart-
ment, which department, thanks chiefly to Hughes,
took up 32 pages of the last annual Estimates. Tiring
of Melbourne, Shepherd migrated to London, where
he is designated Official Secretary of the Commonwealth
of Australia in Great Britain. The salary attached
to this mouthful of capital letters is £2OOO p.a.
Its owner has an assistant secretary at £560 p.a.,
and a private secretary (or the High Commissioner
has) at £3lO p.a., plus h.c.l. allowance in each case;
and last year he got an additional £1555 for ser-
vices alleged to have been rendered “while acting as
High Commissioner.”
* » * *
There are some who regard Shepherd as the lucki-
est I itzdoodle of them all. Others award the dis-
tinction to Percival Edgar Deane. Percival first
came under notice in 1916, when, at the age of 26,
he became Hughes’s private secretary. In 1921 he
succeeded Shepherd as secretary of the Prime Min-
ister’s Department. His salary in that position is
£1250 p.a., which is £5O more than the Director-
General of Public Health gets, and £2OO more than
was paid until this year to that eminently capable
public servant, J. W. Israel. And Israel, who is
40 years older than Deane and will have to retire
presently—wherefore he has received a grant or
compassionate allowance of £soo—has been Com-
monwealth Auditor-General for- 21 years, and was in
the service of the Tasmanian Government for 30
years before that. So that Deane may not sink
under the weight of his arduous duties, there are an
assistant secretary at £6OO p.a. plus a £5O cost-of-
living allowance; two Foreign Affairs officers at
£750 apiece, a private secretary to the Priminister
at £4OB, plus £63, c. 0.1. and basic-wage allowance,
and two other private secretaries at £352 10s. each,
c. 0.1., basic-wage and child-endowment allowances
included. And there is, of course, the priceless
Percy Hunter, who Fitzdoodled for the late Bill
Lyne, and who now draws £2OOO p.a. for acting as
Director of Immigration in Hughes’s electorate.
There or thereabouts.
* * * #
Practically all the Fitzdoodles have the use of
Government motor-cars for themselves and their
womenfolk. Apart from that, thanks to the .pre-
valence of Premiers’ conferences, Treasurers’ confer-
ences and unclassified Ministerial picnics, they do a
great deal of more or less unnecessary travelling at
the public cost. And, emboldened by the privileges
conferred on them, they get into the habit of regard-
ing themselves as eminent public characters, with the
rights of a member of Parliament and the inviol-
ability of a Supreme Court Judge. When Kessell,
a Westralian Fitzdoodle, received notice to quit,
a Royal’Commission was appointed to sift the momen-
tous circumstances, and at least one witness was
brought here from Britain, regardless of expense.
When Davies, a Melbourne motor-car dealer, wanted
to sell the Commonwealth Government Java sugar
(he cleared a £32,000 commission as a result of
one trip), it was to Deane that he went. That
young man, then merely Hughes’s private secretary,
admitted to the Public Accounts Committee that he
had altered and added to Davies’s letter soliciting
a big order before passing it on to the Priminister.
Asked why he had butted into a business so remote
from his recognised duties, he said that “the matter
meant a saving of many thousands of pounds to the

tion.” And when Payne, private secretary to Dooley,
was arranging the notorious five-years’ contract for the
supply of coal to the N. S. Wales Government trawlers,
.at 6s. per ton more than the fair market price, he
acted without reference to the Minister, the Under-
secretary, the Crown Solicitor, the Auditor-General
or the Stores Supply Department. In his own words
to the Royal Commissioner who inquired into the smell-
ful transaction, he didn’t consult Dooley, who was
then Acting-Premier, and “ignored” the Under-Sec-
retary. The Under-Secretary’s testimony is signifi-
cant :
Mr. Payne had not been long appointed when it
became evident to me that he felt he had the autho-
ritv granted bv the Minister, or arrogated to him-
self, of neglecting all departmental rules and proce-
dure, and ignoring the Public Service Board. As
permanent head, it became my duty frequently to
direct him to adopt the correct eourse. The result
in nearly everv case would be an impudent replj\
I found Mr. Payne writing letters under his own

THE GENTLE BOOTLEGGER.
Bootlegging under U.S.A. “prohibition”
has become so respectable that Big Busi-
ness is on to it and has made its respectable
millions. The bad and dangerous end of the
game is held by Sicilians mostly, who will
take the chance of being shot in return for
the chance of a thousand dollars, and who
for a disputed hundred dollars will shoot
the man who double-crosses them. Now
come the pikers, the shoe-string men, the
little people who enter the game lath ; just
as in the tail-end of the great “bear” of
Lake Views every Kalgoorlie barmaid and
bootblack had a “bear” of a share or two.
Seeing a peddler with a barrow-load of
Florida oranges reminded me that Austra-
lian citrus-growers are experimenting in the
U.S.A. trade. The Florida oranges were
good, sound fruit, retailing at 5 for 10 cents
—a penny each. I asked the peddler what
the profits are,; and he told me they were
fair enough. And then
“I got some good rye, Judge-—8 dollars
a quart. Genooine Baccardi rum and Gor-
don gin. Take your order. Judge ?”
Next day it was the driver of a delivery
waggon—“Want some gin, Captain?”
An Italian barber’s. He had engaged a
new boot-black—a negro boy who tried to
help in my murder by the razor, pushing
the chair so that he could make my feet
shine before me whether I would or no. I
gently told him that my shoes had been
"shined,” and he withdrew to a corner of the
saloon; his face lengthening, his lower lip
pendulous as that of a motherless foal. Then
I knew that he had no wages, lived on wind-
fall boots and the polishing of them, and
whacked his tips with the barber.
The Barber: “I got varra nice wine—you
iike? Oh, yes. Grape from California first.
Now Jersey grape come, four dollar fifty
for 281 b. grape. Before this pro’bitione Cali-
fornia grape sell wholesale 50 dolla’s the
ton... .Where-you go, you boy?”
“Goanome,” said the sulky negro lad, put-
ting on his coat. “A guy kin starve here.”
“What you want? Be Rockefellee in
one day?”
“Naw,” replied Dark Complexion. “Am
goan do no starvin’, anyways.”
He departed, a buck nigger, the physical
and .mental opposite of the wide-mouthed
black boy who brings my laundry, tells me
his name is Rameses Mclntosh, and laughs
so that the man who, doesn’t give him 10
cents must feel mean all day.
The barber cursed the ignorance of his
shoeshiner, resigned, and fell back to the
talk of prohibition.
“If you don’, like wine I get you gin,
vermouth, all that. The law? We laugh ; I
don’ want the law. The law do nothing.
Catch man sell beer, let gun-man go. I tell
you what I do? I am near my place. No
gun. Hold-up man come by me, poke gun
in my belly. He say, ‘Where money? Give
or I shoot you full of holes.’ I give fourteen
dolla’s ’leven cents. Then I go into my
house, get my gun, come out, look around
the b10ck.... one hour, two houi\ I see
him. I go up, not give him time, shoot him
in the thigh. He fall. I take mv money,
call policeman. He get two year gaol.”
“Nothing happens to you?”
“No. Policeman say, ‘Good boy shoot up
banditti.’ ”
Thus we see what beautiful things are
Law and Order.
A German paperhanger was wprking in
a studio that was my home for the summer.
We moved from room to room as the paper-
hanger progressed from wall to wall. My
artist friend painted, and I wrote arid cut
at the plays that are going to make Broad-
way stop for a minute and listen.
. At : noon the paperhanger stopped to eat
pie, sausage and cheese all together. He
drank coffee from a thermos bottle, and then
began anew the old subject.
“Before prohibition come, for t’irty year
in New York I drink my bier in mv home.
Nefer go to der saloons. Now I will drink
anyvere. No man shall tell me I shall not
drink as I like. Of gourse, I make my home
prew. Don’t you make some home prew?
No! Vy you don’t make some home prew?
You go to der bootlecker. eh? I tell you
my home prew to make it. Two-andt-half
poundts malt, two ounce hops in sheesecloth ;
put in von gallon vasser; boil two hours.
Fife cents wort’ chopped raisins; cook alone
two hours. Half-poundt of crushed barley
or corn; boil two hours! Squeeze out hops
from sheesecloth; t’row old hops away.
Cook up to boiling again; pour in der malt,

of groundt sugar each bottle. Leaf it six
days. Then you haf der bier mit such a
kick as eight per cendt; better as any bier
of brewers, an’ cost less as five cents der

“And what else do you make?”
“Vine, goodt vine. Fife poundts sugar an’
two poundts cherries; two-an’-half gallons
vasser. Cook der cherries a leetle; let all
stand two monse or six weeks, accordingk
to your patience. You can make boose from
all t’ings that grow. Nature is der greatest
bootleeker in der vorldt.”
Meantime, the bootlegger and the prohibi-
tionist vote together, knowing that the real
drought will never be. It’s a great triumph
for Law.
RANDOLPH BEDFDRD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Statesmanship and Spats.
In the House of Reps, last week the im-
ported deputy-leader of a party which stands
for a German-Jewish socialism, a made-in-
Russia objective, and a pacifist international-
ism which is partly European in origin and
partly Chinese, chided the Australian-born
leader of an Australian-born Min.stry for
not being Australian enough. And nobody
seems to have seen the humor of it.
“Knocking” the Australian-born Ministry
is an _ alluring pastime these days. Some
of it is traceable to the traditional Austra-
lian prejudice against the native product:
and, of course, those who are thus prejudiced
have to give some show of color to
their antipathies. Among its enemies, open
or secret, are Hughes and the interests he
represents ; the Commonwealth Bank, whose
onei-man control is threatened; rejects from
the last Government; disappointed candi-
dates for office, and swarms of civil ser-
vants. The last have heard that the Minis-
try will try to rub along with one taxing
authority and one electoral roll, in which
case their useless occupations will be gone.
And many of the newspapers which ordi-
narily support non-Labor Governments are
more or less unfriendly, some because
HxiGHEiS was passed out; others because
they have surrendered to a cheap sensa-
tionalism and the Ministry promises nothing
in that line ; one or two because of the pro-
jected reforms in the' Commonwealth Bank,
whose success in getting its stuff published
in certain screaming prints is quite remark-
able. So the Ministry has been raked fore
and aft with gibes, flouts and sneeis. It
seems that Bruce doesn’t slap reporters on
the back and tell them what fine fellows
they are. He likewise abstains from attack-
ing his opponents on the score of their reli-
gion, and suggesting that they have been
bought with German or Russian gold. His
speeches, in short, lack the provocative
quality which made Hughes so fascinating
to newspaper men. And there is, lastly, the
painful truth that BrUce didn’t arrive in
politics until May, 1918, while Page wasn’t
elected till December, 1919. Still, the war,
in which both served, is partly responsible
for delaying their political development. And,
though lack of experience is nearly always
a drawback, there are compensating factors
in the present case. For instance, Bruce
and Page haven’t been in public life long
enough to have mastered the ignoble art of
gaining power by dividing the people into
two camps and retaining it by playing on
their racial and sectarian prejudices. Being
men with fresh minds and honest ideals, they
exhibit no disposition to hang on to office by
taking the line of least resistance. On the
contrary, they are addressing themselves quite
briskly to the correction of abuses and the
solution of problems which the old gang of
politicians successfully dodged for a decade.
On their list of projected reforms, besides
the overhauling of the Taxation and Elec-
toral Departments, the Commonwealth line
of steamers and the one-man bank, are the
taking over of the State debts and the insti-
tution of one borrower instead of seven, a
subject which has been dropped since 1910,
and a permanent settlement of the financial
relations between the Commonwealth and
the States, which matter has been deftly
avoided since the Surplus Revenue Act ex-
pired in 1920. The new Ministry has also
undertaken to revive the question of the
constitutional amendments which Hughes
sidetracked for three years. For that reason
alone it is entitled to a fair deal. And for
every other reason it is entitled to be judged
on its legislative and administrative perform-
ances and not on the allegation that Bruce
wears spats.

The Primrose Way to Sheol.
The issue of a new flock of Federal figures,
bringing a lot of matters up to June, 1922,
goes to show that the drunk is drunker than
it was, and the dissipation more dissipated.
This is, of course, most apparent in the loan .
department. In 1913, the year before the
war, there was no State which had achieved
the distinction of owing £lOO per head (net
liability, sinking funds being deducted),
though Westralia, with £96 10s. per head
owing, was very near it. In 1914 Westralia
was over the Century mark. Queensland
was over it by June, 1921, and South Aus.
by June, 1922, Tasmania will be over it
by June, 1923, making four out of six States
which have put up a world’s record in in-
debtedness, without foreign war or the finan-
cial burden of defence preparations. The,
rake’s progress of the six States is shown
hereunder: —

The more striking features of the case,
viewed in a few of its more important as-
pects, may be summarised thus: —
Only two States have the excuse that they have
big works on hand. Victoria and Tasmania are both
trying to end their dependence on the precarious
coal supply by covering the country with electric
power—one with brown coal and the other with water
force. Four States are just pottering.
All the borrowing doesn’t hasten the growth of
population. Keeping clear of the war years, the
increase for 1910-11-12 is officially set down at
101,123, 143,624, and 164,652. For the year 1921
it was 98,781 only, so the big loans apparently kept
people away. Complete figures for 1922 are wanting.
The borrowing doesn’t seem to help agriculture
either. After stupendous and ruinous efforts at “set-
tlement” the area under crop was less at latest
returns than in 1915-16 and 1916-17. Too many
people are taken away from the land to build
loan works that never pay.
To provide for losses and otherwise pay for politi-
cal corruption State taxes (peace taxes) went up
from 18s. 7d. per head per annum all round in 1910 to
335. in 1916, and another six years (1922) saw
them up to 645. 2d. per head. This was to pay for the
privilege of going into debt, and taking men away
from paying occupations to build things that have
to be supported out of taxes. The aggregate interest
bill was £7,455,032 in 1901. It was £9,201,909
in 1910. It was £21,376,390 at last June and
is more now.
If we go on as we have been going the States
will owe £1,200,000,000 by 1943: the annual
interest bill will then be £60,000,000, and the
State direct taxes nearly £l2 per head, including
the baby. Under that burden most ot the land
will inevitably go out of use.
The construction of railways and tramways was
the original excuse for systematic borrowings, they
being necessary and having a sort of “permanent
and reproductive” look about them. Twenty-two
years ago these represented £124,000,000 of loan
money, while £65,000,000 w r as invested in odd-
ments. At June, 1921 (later details are lacking),
£245,500,000 was ir. railways, and £213,000,000
in oddments—some of them very odd indeed.
N.S.W., by its peculiar configuration, is in more
need to make new ports available for trade than
any of its neighbors. Yet out of the £33,600,000
of new debt it contracted in the past three years
N.S.W. didn’t contrive to build the scrap of line
required to connect the existing railway system with
Twofold Bar, or the bits necessary, to join the Nowi'a
or Goulburn lines with Jervis Bay (Goulburn and
its Surroundings haven’t even a road to their natural
port), or to connect up Port Stephens (the line
dodges it by a few miles), or to give the northern
Tableland a short practicable route to aiiy northern
port, or to carry out its old, grey-whiskered pledge
to connect the North Coast with Brisbane. And it
can’t (it just can’t ) get the little fragment of
rail finished between Binnaway and Wenis Creek,
because that would enable the West and North-West
and North to trade without the business taking the
long round by Sydney. And for want of that bit of
road the Hawkesbury bridge remains the one link
between the North, which supplies more than half
the coal, and the South, where are located four-
fifths of the people who want coal.
If the Great Drunk resulted in everybody
being employed, and all hands keeping merry
and bright, the thing would be understand-
able, But the country simply reeks with
unemployment and partial employment. Pre-
mier Theodore declares (probably falsely)
that Queensland has less unemployment
than any other part; yet the latest official
figures for that State showed 124 unionists
out of every 1000 to be unemployed. And
in N. S. Wales there is such shortage of
work among the Newcastle coal-miners that
in desperation their leaders advocate some
sort of pooling arrangement to make the
available money go round a bit more evenly.
The Thing that Dooley Made.
It began, of course, when Dooley, and two
Federal members who were less accessible
than Dooley, signed a statement that the
Labor movement required to be rescued from
the control of men who didn’t labor, but
were mere red-eyed revolutionaries, taking
their orders from shady characters in
Russia, where cannibalism has resumed. All
the good haters of the party sharpened their
teeth to bite Doox.ey fatally, as the monkey
bit a late King of Greece, for he had com-
mitted the same crime as Higgs— -criticised
the frowsy tin gods in office. They didn’t
go for him on any national matter, such as
that he and his late Ministerial colleagues
tried, in their Profiteering Bill and Land
Confiscation Bill, to put in the hands of
portfolio-holders such enormous powers of
persecution and discrimination-—of making
law, enforcing law, dr granting exemption
from law —that even an honorary Minister
would be liable to be offered a financial
consideration every day in the week. But they
found him guilty of something of their own
size-—something connected with the alleged
faking of records in a petty branch league
to qualify somebody for appointment to the
futile and nominally unremunerative but
coveted dignity of M.L.C. Dooley’s re-
sponse was a blast of thunder which implied
that his judges were dabblers in evidence
which they knew to be false, and were mostly
disappointed and maddened applicants for
the M.L.C. job—it appeared that 300 applied
for .if simultaneously. . He described the
rulers of the Labor movement as “uncouth
crooks and their hangers-on,” and urged the
great, clean, honest Labor majority to rise
and cast them out. But as it is always
being urged to do this yet never does it, the
question arises whether the l majority hasn’t
degenerated. It probably has, and there is a
very good reason for it in the decay of educa-
tion. By this is meant, not school education,'
but that which is obtained later by becoming
efficient in a skilled trade, by being proild of
it, and by haying good hopes of setting up in
business on the strength of it, and climbing
out of the “wage-slave” category. The un-
skilled “laborer” class is the least desirable
section of the working community. It has
no bright future to dream about, except a
precarious place in politics, or a job as union
secretary or “organiser,” or the hazy chance
of a revolution and a spell of brigandage.
Therefore, it is a positive and active danger
where it exists in undue numbers. It is a
very poor producer, and it furnishes a large
proportion of the criminal (as a rule, the
violently criminal) section. Even when its
lack of skill is. thinly disguised by a mem-
bership ticket in the Window Cleaners’ or
Garbage-tin-shifters’ Union, the result is not
wholly satisfactory. In spite of all that,
the class has been cultivated by State poli-
ticians who borrowed wonderful sums (the
amount added to the State debts last finan-
cial year was £48,471,726), partly for real
public works, but largely to “absorb” the
unskilled unemployed. Consequently there
is a N.S.W. union 14,000 strong with no
purpose in life save building unprofitable
loan railways, and it demands unprofitable
loan railways as its vested right. To further
cultivate it labor politicians have put rigid
restrictions on the teaching of trades, while
they have pushed up boys’ wages in dead-
end, obb-job occupations, and thus produced
an immense and ungainly crop of adults
with no occupation. Now' the thing which
Dooley helped to make is turning on
Dooley. Wffiat else did Dooley expect?
The Modern Whipping-boy.
“Whitehall” knows why they do it:—
The writer of “The Mud-slinging Habit” (B.
l/3/’23) misses the psychology of the admittedly wide-
spread disposition to criticise, not to say put the
boot into, great artists such as Melba and Asche.
Asche is unquestionably an arrogant and intensely
egotistical customer. Compare him with H. B.
Irving, Lewis Waller, or half-a-dozen visiting stars
whose names will readily occur, and you may realise
how bad his manners are. He plays Petruchio
nearly as well off the stage as he does on it.
Melba is the most persistent self-advertiser of this
or any period, and she is a humbug. A kindly,
fairlv-generous, genial and broad-minded humbug,
yet a perfect sample of the breed. She is capable
of getting a continent-wide advt. out of being bitten
by a flea ; and any city or town in the world where
she proposes to give a concert ipso facto becomes lier
spiritual home. Of late years Australia has been
irritated to an unprecedented extent by skiters,
bounders and humbugs of all sorts, great and small.
To take a handful at random: Dr. Man-nix, . with
his windy defiances of the British Empire; L.O.L.
blitherers, who rake in such cash and credit as they
do on the impudent pretence that they are under-
mining the R.C. Church; politicians like “Captain-
Chaplain” Wilson, of N. S. Wales (a legislator who
hangs on to a rank that in strict military law never
existed) ; papers which whoop of their determination
to morally reform the. community in between highly-
spiced reports of rape cases; eligibles who talked
loudly of their patriotism before the war, shirked,
and now are talking patriotism again. All such per-
sons and institutions provoke feelings of furious resent-
ment in the collective Australian mind, though indi-
vidually they are too small for concerted attack.
Presently some big public figure comes along who
epitomises several of the qualities to which a con-
siderable proportion of the population objects.
Hughes, for example, epitomised departmentalism,
its insolence, its wastefulness and its nepotism; and it
was for that reason, chiefly, that he fell. -Asche
epitomises braggadocio and vulgar conceit, and
Melba that exasperating method of .self-advertisement
which assumes the public to be half-witted. She
knows, when she returns to Australia and weeps with
joy to be home again, that we heard of her tears
when she arrived home in London, and, again, when
the yearning of years was gratified, and she got
home to New York. The misfortune of Asche and
Melba in this connection is their good fortune: they
are the tall trees. Asche in the critic’s hands
becomes every braggart in Australia; Melba is a
thousand “Captain-Chaplain” Wilsons. The world
has changed since madiasval times, when kings and
queens had whipping-boys. . A sovereign democracy
now makes whipping-boys of its kings and queens.

Wanted: Medical Assessors.
During the last few months judges in Vic-
toria and S. Aus. have been tacking doses
of the lash on to their maximum sentences
for crimes of One unfortunate
whom Judge Gordon, of Adelaide, treated
in this way has been certified to be a degem
erate ; and, indeed, in view of the. nature of
his offence, which was committed, on a girl
of 12, the evidence of the doctors was more
or less superfluous. For the hanging of such
a man as this, or his prototype, who, in the
Melbourne Criminal Court a few days later,
was given three years and 20 lashes for
assaulting a girl of six, there is a certain
amount to be said. Hanging, anyhow, re-
presents a cure. Flogging is no cure and
no deterrent (imagine trying to flog a dip-
somaniac into sobriety!). The Medical
Journal of Australia lately dealt with
the case of “11 children who were brought
for treatment to the John Hopkins Hospital
because of profound changes in character
and behavior”':—'
In every instance this' change had followed an
attack of epidemic encephalitis. . . .The,most striking
changes were in the character and behavior of
the children. They became irritable, quick-tempered,,
boisterous, quarrelsome, afid sometinles showed
streaks of brutality. They became destructive of
property and careless of their personal appearance;
In some cases , exhibition , tendencies and extraordi-
nary sexual precocity were presept-' In many cases
inability to sleep occurred. .. .Time appears to be
the sole healing factor. Punishment does not assist,
in any way.
Apply these scientific facts to the cases of
the unhappy beings whom our non-sCientific
judges periodically order to be flogged, and
it becomes evident that a tremendous lot of
useless barbarity is going on. We have long
since learned to look with horror on mediae-
val Europe’s attempts to cure madness by
torture. Yet are we not guilty of some-
thing very similar when we flog men for
acts which are the direct results of brain-
lesions? It is many years since The Bul-
letin first advanced the view that, just as
in shipping cases a marine assessor sits on
the bench and assists the judge, so in crim-
inal cases a mental assessor or psycholo-
gical expert should perform a like duty. The
reform is as badly needed as ever it was, for,
though flogging epidemics afe comparatively
rare nowadays, the judges remain as spor.i-
ful as ever of modern discoveries in the medi-
cal field—or, anyhow, they do so where
such discoveries threaten to trench on what
they regard as their exclusive territory.
On Thinking Nationally.
The reflections of “Griffith Mo.ses” :
The latest horror from Turk Land in Western
Asia has, just this one mitigating feature—in his
own ferocious way Mustapha Hemal is “thinking
nationally,” and acting on his think. It will be
good for Australia if our own Mustapha Bruce, who
lately discoursed on national thought, will do the,
same. In very old days, before there was any
Turk, and before the Arab had begun to bustle'
about much, Europe and European culture extended
to the Taurus, if not to the Euphrates. Despite
the temporary Persian occupation the border was
still there till after Mohammedanism was born, and
the culture was in Asia Minor till the other day.
Then the capable Mustapiia Kemal, thinking nation-
ally, which is the only good thing to be said
about his thoughts, decided for creating a uniform
race thereabouts by the drastic process of butcher-
ing of expelling the earlier owners. He went in
for closer Turkish settlement, and especially for
the settlement of the waste places of the kingdom'—
having first wasted them to make them waste. Of
course he will only sow barbarism, his race having
nothing else to sow, but it will be national bar-
barism. A few months ago his savages—-better
fighters under a capable leader than Zulus, Ghoork-
has or Senegalis, and incomparably better armed—
fell like an avalanche on the west-coast regions
where the Seven Early Churches hung out, with
the result that the accumulation of ashes is unpre-
cedented, and little Greece is crowded with a mil-
lion penniless refugees, whose wealth, for most
of them had been in fair circumstances, had van-
ished in a night. Now the Black Sea ports, Greek
settlements that date back almost as far as his-
tory, are being similarly cleaned out.
If Europe turned a Kemal of its own loose, to
prod the Turks of Constantinople and Thrace into
deep water, some room might be provided for the
refugees; but, in any case, the feeling would remain
that the area of pure white settlement, or the area
available for the same, is narrow, and isn’t growing.
Rather it grows less. The real white man owns
America? including frozen America, as far down
as the 7 Rio Grande, barring a blackish corner where
cotton grows. South of the river the position is
mixed. The failure of the Spaniards and Portu-
guese to kill off the previous inhabitants with the
exactitude of the New England Puritans —the men
who arrived in pious mood, arid first fell on their
knees, and then on the aborigines—has spoiled the
chances of a pure white race over that area. The
white man of European blood also possesses little
Europe, barring the Mohammedan corner; a narrow

habitable strip in Asia; South Africa, save for
the fact that the black man, not being permitted
now to commit suicide in tribal wars, multi-
plies exceedingly, and threatens to crowd his master
out; Maoriland, and Australia. Four-fifths of the
last, or practically everything above a line drawn
from Brisbane to Perth, is the empty region which
represents the remaining hope of a genuine white
people, and especially of an Anglo-Saxon people.
The business of being trustee, on this immense
scale, for the nation, for the race, for posterity and
for civilisation, is about the biggest one on earth.
A civilised Mustapha Ivemal, if Kemals were ever
civilised, with his intense nationalism and his bound-
less energy, and his passion for settlement, would fill
the bill. But unless Mustapha Bruce is quite dif-
ferent from his predecessors and his old colleagues
he will be content to “think nationally” about
Canberra, and take a world-wide view of Collins-
street. A really good Prime Minister, according
to Australian usage, is one who remembers every-
thing except (1) the empty four-fifths of the con-
tinent, and the need for its settlement and defence;
(2) the fact that it represents the last big oppor-
tunity of the white race; (3) the enemies who,
naturally and inevitably, have their eyes on it;
and (4) that we have only so many days of grace,
though no one knows how many or how few, to
assert our claim by taking effective possession.
Mustapha Bruce may not be a “really good” Prime
Minister of that sort. At any rate, he knows now
how he can avoid being one.

The N. S. Wales Prison System.
Dear Bulletin, —I have never been in gaol,
but I have been over many, and in my
opinion the complaints of the N. S. Wales
Prison Reform Society, which the Minister has
spurned “with courage and determination,”
were almost certainly justified. I inspected
Parramatta with a naval (R.N.) captain.
Half-way through our pilgrimage he re-
marked : “I’m fed up with this: it’s eye-
wash.” His trained eye had recognised many
signs that meant nothing to me. Since that
day I have spent three years in the army,
and it has taught me much about man’s
arrogance—and worse—to man. The way
I reason on the subject is this. Suppose
the governor or deputy-governor of a gaol
happened to be an official of the truculent
sort that was often put in charge of a base
camp or a training brigade after half a life-
time in the ranks. Suppose that, instead
of dealing with men whom he had a right
to respect, he had under him the fallen and
the friendless. Suppose that his charges,
instead of having their rights protected by
a special Act of Parliament and thousands
of regulations, the most important of which
were known to them, had virtually no rights
except such as were granted by the 0.0. and
his orderly-room staff. Suppose that the
camp or training brigade functioned, not in
the open but behind 30-foot walls; that “in-
cidents” between officers and subordinates
were not capable of being witnessed by men
of good repute, but only by discredited per-
sons ; that “incidents” in the dark cells,
which, to the gaolbird, are what the clink
is to a soldier, were only to be participated
in by those whom the C.O. or his adjutant
selected for the purpose; and that the rank
and file were not highly literate (as in the
A.1.F.), but extremely illiterate, and to that
extent handicapped in the matter of stating
their grievances. And suppose, finally, that
the C.O. and his henchmen had been in this
degrading environment for 20 or 30 years.
Would it not be natural to expect a certain
amount of injustice and brutality? We all
know that plenty of brutality went on in
the army; and riot only in base camps, but
in the more human atmosphere of the line.
It was a party of Diggers who, to their
credit, intervened, near Ypres, when a
Maoriland “eonchie” (a Quaker) was being
towed with ropes along the duck-boards to
the Menin-road under the supervision of a
sergeant. They threw the sergeant into a
shell-hole and unbound the unconscious “con-
chie.” My point is that if such things can
be done in the green wood of military ser-
vice worse arc likely to be done in the dry
of penal servitude. The naval man above
mentioned pointed out to me in the .train,
on the way back to Sydney, that we had
seen nothing that might not have been
readied up for us. It reminded him of a
visit he had paid to a German cruiser. The
ideal of the Government —and it is one likely
to be welcomed by the gaol equivalents of
the best of the A.l.F.'s base-camp C.O.’s—
should be a gaol system without any reti-
cences ; one which would permit the inspec-
tion of gaols and the interviewing of pri-
soners (with safeguards for the latter
against victimisation) by the nominees of
certain representative bodies at a moment’s
notice. Even then, in the present unde-
veloped state of human nature, there is
likely to be injustice galore: but it would
be minimised, and that would be something
to the good.—Yours, 2nd Divvy.
The Missionary and the Miner.
“Kunika Tau” on Papua’s pioneers:—
I am glad “Bouragi” (B. 22/2/’23) has taken up
the cudgels for the much maligned miners of Papua,
who, unlike the missionaries and Govt, officers, have
no publicity agents. It is just as well to dissipate
the illusion that the Papuan native is invariably
a peace-loving- person who would not injure a
fellow-creature, unless forced to do so in self-defence.
Old hands in Papua know better; they can recall
many murders committed by the natives. Chalmers
and Tomkins were done to death at Goaribari; Hur-
ley near the head of Magavura Creek; George
Clark on the Mambare; Green at Tamata ; Campion
and King on their way to the Yodda; Bracken burg
and Jimmy the Austrian at the Gira. The two last,
harmless old fossickers, were cruelly murdered by
the Koari tribe. These are only some instances
of many, and as for unsuccessful murderous at-
tacks on white men there have been legion. The
Papuan native is not quite so docile as some people
would have us believe; indeed, he is naturally
cruel. If he is killing a pig he puts it on a lire
before it is dead; should he capture a wallaby he
breaks its legs so that it cannot get away ; and he
has a shuddersome habit of plucking birds when
alive. The miner in Papua, as “Bouragi” says, has
had many untrue and unjust things said about him,
and much deserved credit is still withheld. The
interior of Papua would be practically an unknown
quantity were it not for the pioneering- work done
by the miners, who were mostly explorers as well
as prospectors. No one will ever know the hard-
ships and dangers. encountered by these men, who
struggled on to their objective through a fever-

And Frank Anstey says that two tails are easier to twist.
stricken country. Sometimes they were rewarded by
a fairly decent find of gold; at other times they
drew a blank, returned to the nearest settlement for
a fresh supply of provisions, and started out again.
The later-comers in Papua have comfortable homes
to live in ; and in some instances a subsidised mail
service, so that they keep in almost daily communi-
cation with the civilised world. But I defy anybody
to name me one missionary who has done as much
to open up the interior of Papua as such men as
Crowe, Stone, Elliott, Davies, Simpson, McClel-
land ; and these are only a few of manv
And from the missionary’s corner
“Bouraoi” (B. 22/2/’23) makes an indignant criti-
cism of what the speaker with the Australian Board
of Missions’ New Guinea Film Lecture did not say.
In fairness to Miss Neale, let us first mention that
she is not personally responsible for the lecture—it was
prepared with considerable care by others. “Bouraoi”
evidently was not present at its delivery, or he
would not have treated particular statements as hav-
ing a general reference. To give an illustration.
Miss Neale said: “In 1895 gold was discovered
right up the Mamba River, and for several years
there was a flow of miners from Australia. The
tribes here were vigorous and warlike, and a certain
amount of fighting took place, and some of the
whites were killed, including a Government official.
It became so bad that the diggers cleared out for a
time, and the Government had to adopt severe
measures. Sir William Macgreqor writes of this
time: ‘I have been compelled to shed blood in New
Guinea, to my great sorrow. I shall not rest con-
tent till I can make such reparation as is possible.
I want to plant a Christian teacher wherever such
blood has been shed under my authority.’ When
white men come for their own personal gain, blood
is shed, and the natives refuse to make terms with
them.” The point is that, as a matter of actual
fact, when white men went in here for personal
gain, blood —white men’s blood —was shed, and the
diggers—again actual fact—did have to leave 'the
Mamba River (not the island, of course), and the
natives did refuse to make terms with the whites
until Sir Wm. Macgregor had been forced, to his
deep regret, to shed, native blood. Furthermore,
some years before this, two missionaries landed
among the natives further east, equally as murderous
as the Binandele folk, and, in spite of the constant
threat of death, very soon broke down all opposition
without any blood being shed. In fact, there are
places all over New Guinea where the miner was
only able to go in because the missionary had been
there first. Miss Neale’s final statement reads:
“When the missionary goes, it is very seldom that
he is killed ; the comparatively few deaths that have
occurred have been due to revenge for wrongs done
by white men.” This appears in “Boxjragi’s” ver-
sion: “Miss Neale’s statement that any murder of
whites which has taken place has been due,” etc.
Which has a slightly different meaning. We will
admit that Miss Neale's statement is not strictly
correct, for James Chalmers's death was not due
to wrongs done by white men; but, taking the
Pacific as a whole, it will be found that the state-
ment is absolutely true in the majority of cases.
We. are sorry “Bouraoi” considers that the “atti-
tude of the early miners and prospectors towards the
natives was in every case admirable.” Some, indeed,
were splendid men, and no one has spoken more
warmly of them than the missionaries; but we would
like to show “Bouragi” a bundle of letters written
on the spot by one who gained the genuine respect of
the miners because of the stand he felt forced to
take up on behalf of the natives.

“Solomon Malaprop” writes:—
In my younger days, long before I married and
became the father of Rehoboam Malaprop, who is
only a limited credit to the family, I used to read
the more sanguinary parts of history, and I then
considered the billet of a tenth-century pope the
limit for picturesque precariousness. It seemed, to
beat being a Mexican president or one of the final
Roman anperors. His was a stirring life, but I
think now that the existence of a N.S.W. Labor
leader (especially a Labor Premier) will one day
equal it as closely as the times permit. McGowen
was deposed by internal intrigue, or it might be
called palace revolution. Holman was deposed and
sent into exile, along with his principal followers.
Storey was confronted by an insurrection almost as
soon as he attained office. He spent most of his
brief reign in hiding—hiding in recess and hiding
in England. Dooley' spent almost all his term of
office in concealment —in fact, he and Storey were
only officially visible for some two months in two
years, recess being to them a sort of castle of
St. Angelo, and a refuge from unpleasant enemies
and hostile friends. Dooley put down the Bailey
insurrection with difficulty, and the McGirr insur-
rection with more difficulty, and the way the royal
family (i.e., the Cabinet) supplied information about
its internal dissensions to the enemy’s newspapers
was marvellous. Then, the other day, a section
of the alleged Labor subjects outside rose as decisively
as Cromwell did against Charles 1., and using
much the same language, and the nominal governing
or inside section split also, and in a moment King
Dooley I. was washed off his throne into the deep
waters of execration, where he bobbed about excitedly.
No dead N.S.W. Labor leader has yet been found
lying about unexpectedly, nor has one disappeared,
but it will come. I have a premonition that the first
victim will be Dooley. Some unbalanced and
brooding person with wild hair, of the class which
furnished the assassins of the President of Poland,
of the Finance Minister of Bohemia, of Michael
Collins and Perceval Brookfield and hundreds
more, believing all that somebody says of some-
body else, will resolve to sacrifice himself that the
State may be saved. He will see, with his blood-
shot eye, the plain, plodding, plugging Dooley
as a picturesque monster of iniquity like Macaulay’s
sketch of Charles Stuart :
And the Man of Blood was there
With his long, essenced hair.
Arid then he will go forth and slay him clumsily
with a knife and fork.

N. S. Wales has spent 14 borrowed millions
in putting returned soldiers “on the land,”
and already £5,000,000 is considered lost. In
addition to the costly settlement on repur-
chased land other people were put last year
on 1,200,867 acres of State land, which is
about an ordinary year’s work. And with
all this industry, which has been in progress
for a century, the cultivated area was re-
ported in 1921 as 4,465,143 acres —a great
falling-off as compared with five years earlier,
and about equal to three years’ “settlement.”
Yet the Government which lives in Mac-
quarie-street, and the Million Farmers who
farm in Martin-place, and the Million Club-
bers. who club in Fitt-street, want to borrow
millions more to keep the dismal procession
moving on to the land, and off the land, and
on again, and off again, like a stage army
of six which multiplies itself by marching
round a stage tree. Some 60 years ago old
John Robertson's law threw open all the
public lands of the State to small selectors,
and in 23 years over 23,000,000 acres were
taken. Where old John’s settlers have gone
is unknown, even to the police. Some of the
pathos of “settlement” may be seen in semi-
suburban spots, Yvhere small families potter
on small areas, with a few fowls, a few vege-
tables, a few blasted hopes, and a pathetic
readiness to sell hot water to campers and
travellers. These represent the returned men
who had no trades to return to. (Thanks
largely to the enormous expenditure of loan
money on the employment of unskilled work-
ers, most of the present generation seem to
belong to the pretty hopeless order of
“laborer.”) If the big State was, instead,
six small States, there might be an occa-
sional Government that could make a suc-
cess of settlement. It would be a sort of
farmer Government, ruling a modest area
Yvhich its members could know personally,
and not merely by hearsay, and not a Gov-
ernment with its sense of proportion knocked
all out of gear by talking always in millions
and thinking in terms of city allotments
at £lOOO per foot. Australia, so far as popu-
lation goes, is still in the Pilgrim Father
stage, but one or two of its bigger cities and
Administrations ape Imperial Rome or deca-
dent Babylon in their frill, with the result
that small things are done on too huge a
scale.

“Anglican” : “Sky Pilot” (B. 15/2/’23)
must have read about Christianity in some
girls’ magazine. Perhaps he does know that
every day in Holy Week is holy. Perhaps
he does not know that Christianity is time-
less and the sacrifice of Calvary knows no
past nor future.' Hence Good Friday, 1923,
is as important to a Christian as Good
Friday, 29 —-to a Christian, though not to
a “philosophic” patroniser of Christ. Inci-
dentally, Paul does insist on keeping days
and seasons: he merely protests against the
compulsory observance of Jewish festivals.
Does “Sky PTlot” know that Good
Friday, like the Mass, re-presents (not
represents) Christ’s Passion? But all this
by the way. Arch. Wright simply suggests
that, as it is an insult to Anglican and
R.C.’s (who represent 70 per cent, of the
community) to defile Good Friday, it might
be courteous to arrange for that day’s festi-
vities on another day.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Having been added to the long procession
of the expelled, N.S.W. ex-Premier Dooley
may be “snooping)' around presently in
search of another party to attach himself
to. But past experience hasn’t been very
encouraging—to the parties which have done
the adopting. Holman and Hughes were
taken in when they were homeless. They
soon took possession of the mansion and
bossed it. They brought along their unde-
sirable friends, too, and the mess they left
behind them by reason of slovenly house-
keeping will take a century to clean up.
Much is being said about the briskness A f
business, the abundance of money, the bright
outlook and the recuperative powers of the
country. When the dope maniac has multi-
plied what was only lately regarded as a
heavy dose by 12 (in 1905-06-07 the ban
spendings of the six States were well under
£4,000,000 per year) he ought to wear a
temporary aspect of painted brilliance. And
when a country borrows in one year a sum
almost equal to all the accumulated coin,
bullion and paper money in all its banks,
and much more than the year’s gross railwav
revenue, prices ought to rise. Consequently
people are paying 30s. for shares which they
could get at 17s. 6d. but for the loan disease,
and sanguine dolts are giving £lO a foot for
land that may be worth 10s. when the dope
bottle runs low.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Now that Watt has been stifled in the Speaker's
chair while Hughes sits glowering in the Corner,
the balance of power in debate has shifted to the
Opposition side. Labor has never been stronger
in acrid, vehement speakers, and Bruce had a taste
of what is coming to him when Anstey launched
his no-confidence motion. Anstey’s power as an
ironist is well known, and never has his weird con-
ception of the incongruous been more disastrously
employed for the belittlement of a fellow creature.
But Anstey is only one. There is Yates, who has
returned to the House with a redoubled fluency;
the merciless Blakeley; the scathing Seullift ; Parker
Moloney’s long memory and schoolmasterly precis-
ion ; Frank Brennan’s pungency—it is a formidable
band of sharpshooters, making a way for the heavier
artillery of Makin, McGrath, Fenton, 'tiley senior,
and Mahoney., Excluding Latham, Maxwell and
Pratten, who, in the circumstances, may have little
to say, there, isn’t much on the Ministerial side.
The one fighting speaker in the Cabinet is Stewart,
but he has only the manner, and not the matter.
A man doesn’t necessarily extinguish him-
self by becoming Speaker, as Watt has done.
He probably remembers that Bent, whose
Government he assisted John Murray to
throw out in 1909, had previously been in
thf? chair; and it was as Speaker of the
N.S.W. Assembly (1883-87) that Edmund
Barton built much of the reputation which
later helped to make him the only possible
first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth,
In Tasmania Stafford Bird was Treasurer
after he was Speaker; and in Queensland'
Arthur Morgan stepped out of the chair on
September 15, 1903, to be sworn in as Pre-
mier two days later, and he had never held
a portfolio before.
An odd thing happened in the Senate last
week, when “Jupp” Gardiner, Labor leader
in that House, berated Pearce for his deser-
tion of Hughes, and spoke with significant
friendliness of the Man Who Was Passed
Out. Along with Gardiner’s declaration that
he stands by Dooley in his trouble, and the
latter’s hurried trip north to consult with
Theodore, it has started a report that
Hughes, Theodore, Dooley and Gardiner in-
tend launching a moderate Labor party
with the support of unionists hostile to
Tammany influences and the Reds. There
THE FALSE ALARM.
“The Gov.-General's speech at the opening of Parliament mainly consisted of a brief apology for
the Government’s lack of policy.”
DR. GOV.-GENERAL FORSTER: “Tut, tut! Little Bruce-Page Policy won't he here for a
long . time yet — wasn't your summons rather premature?"
GOVERNMENT PARTY NURSE: “Yes, sir; hut you know what a worrit these newly-mar-
ried couples are. Still, bless yer, sir, yer money's all right, and it's sich a com-
fort to have yer round the place.”
is nothing improbable in the notion of
Hughes going back on his tracks; certainly,
the well-advertised hostility of many of
those who parted company with him in 1916
has always bqen more apparent than real.
And Dooley’s position looks desperate
enough for anything. But the imagination
boggles at the idea of Theodore throwing
in his lot just now with two beaten leaders
who have been expelled by the party
machine.
The Vie. Auditor-General, giving evidence
before the Committee of Public Accounts
the other day. got in some remarks that
should be as superfluous as an affidavit that
the sun rises in the morning and not at night.
Yet apparently they were a sort.of revelation.
He said there should be a limit somewhere
to the spending of loan money and the piling
of debt on railway lines which were supposed
to be finished years ago. He held that the
replacing of old rails, re-modelling of ill-
constructed platforms and general repairing
of ancient loan-works shouldn’t be charged
even in part to new loans, and that aban-
doned works and assets shouldn’t be kept in
the balance-sheet at full value, or at any
value. Really, the high official was only
suggesting that a great department shouldn’t
be a sort of fraudulent trustee and an un-
scrupulous account-faker, but nobody seemed
to see that any reflection was thrown on any-
body or anything.
S.A. Government has arranged for about
200 skilled artisans in the building trade—
masons, bricklayers, plasterers and carpen-
ters—to come from the U-K. shortly. Nearly
all the skilled men in the State are over 40.
Parents will not apprentice their boys, pre-
ferring the quick return which the high wage
of unskilled labor gives. And, of course,
the rate of pay for unskilled labor is almost
always fixed by a vote-hunting Government,
which borrows millions to play with and has
an unprotected infant to pass the bill on to.
You never know where the consequences of
the loan disease are going to hit you next.
Pearce, Minister for Home and Terri-
tories, is now drawing a large salary in his
eighth Cabinet, yet when the matter of the
Northern Territory was mentioned the other
day he talked about consulting with various
people, and receiving a report, and possibly
formulating a policy—just as if he had heard
of the place for the first time. Similarly,
when Hughes, who has been in politics,
chiefly in or on behalf of N.S.W., for 29
years, was asked for his view on the New
State movement, which has been a smoulder-
ing issue for 60 years, he wanted time to
make himself acquainted with it. The com-
munity is nearly as tired of this sort of
formula as it is of the orthodox judge who
blinks an eye in surprise on hearing of the
Melbourne Cup.
Hughes has rarely shown himself more
Hughesian than he did in the Sydney Daily
Mail libel matter. On the day before the
general election—the day of all others on
which it was desirable that the public press
should be free to discuss him—he handed
the paper a writ for libel. The effect was
to close its mouth so far as he, the Prime
Minister, was concerned. Last week the
action lapsed for lack of prosecution. In
effect, Hughes, who has been Attorney-Gen-
eral and is a K.G., said to the Court: “Where
it suits me I will make use of you to silence
distasteful criticism, just as England’s 17th-
century kings did. No one knows better
than I that the issue of an election writ is
an abuse of the Court’s powers. If I had
considered the feelings of the Court I would
at least have made gestures suggesting that
the writ was not bogus. What I say, how-
ever, is: ‘Damn the feelings of the Court.
Also, Damn the opinions of the public ! I
am Hughes.’ ”
While Premier Lawson (Vic.) is cutting
mutton with the great ones of the earth dis-
gruntled Liberals are planning an attack on
his Ministry in August. If Allan’s Cookies
support the plotters the Government will be
gone. Its chief sin, in the eyes of Assembly-
men, is that it has had too long an innings.
By the time Parliament has reassembled it
will have broken the record. George Turn-
er’s first Ministry was in power 1895 days.
Lawson will beat that on May 29.
In N. S. Wales the law still is that no
liquor may be sold any day after 6 p.m.
Of course, tens of thousands of diners have
their liquor and pay for it —some of them
on licensed premises, many of them in un-
licensed restaurants. The theory is that the
consumers have bought the liquor before 6
o’clock and paid for it. No doubt some of
them do this ; it is equally certain that thou-
sands of them don’t. Sometimes the offend-
ing vendors are trapped, and in that case
they can mostly well afford to pay the £4O
fine which is imposed. The. cafe proprietor
has no license, so that isn’t imperilled. The
whole business is a scandal. The proper
thing to do would be to permit liquor to be
served with meals up to 8.30 p.m. But if
Parliament is too dull to take that step,
then, in justice to hotelkeepers and caf4-
proprietors who will not break the law, all
restaurants should be licensed, and for three
breaches of the law the premises should be
automatically delicensed, as restaurants. At
present, not only are people encouraged to
break the lftw, but those who'abide by it
are heavily penalised; for once let a place
be known as law-abiding, and, therefore,
bone-dry after 6 p.m., and thousands of
diners give it a wide berth.
The jury system is being raked fore and
aft in Adelaide. To a Royal Commission
looking into the possibilities of law reform,
Hannan, Parliamentary Draughtsman and
Assistant Crown Solicitor, admitted that “in
old days juries stood between the tyranny of
the monarch and the liberty of the subject,”
but he cculdn’t see that they serve “any
good purpose” now. He would drop the sys-
tem first in civil cases and ultimately in
criminal, with three Judges in the latter
case to give decisions. The fees for the
present panel (40 jurors) would about pay
for the extra judges. Evidence was given
by citizens with experience of serving on
juries; they were fairly unanimous that cer-
tain counsel (un-named) can sway the ordi-
nary juryman to a dangerous extent. But
presumably that applies only to counsel for
the defence; and the difficulty might be got
over by introducing the 15 jury, with a majo-
rity verdict.
In N.S.W. there is an extra-violent scan-
dal about alleged neglect and cruelty in gaols
and mental hospitals. Such things happen
almost everywhere periodically. And when
all the allegations, or some of them, are
proved, there will be the eternal question
of what to do next. A crowd of either luna-
tics or criminals is a nerve-racking proposi-
tion to deal with. The person for the posi-
tion of keeper in either place is a saint—
not a mild and drivelling saint (which is the
most plentiful variety), but one of intelli-
gence and firmness. The problem for the
reformer is to find a large and steady supply
of durable saints for a wearing, uninspiring,
long-hour, short-pay trade with a fair amount
of danger and no visible future in it. Per-
verted souls with a love of cruelty may find
something in the business over and above the
salary, but no one else does, barring the
scarce saints above alluded to. Yet
unless someone invents a mechanical record-
ing ear and a mechanical night-walking eye
which can be on duty in every apartment of
the gaol or asylum, these people must be
trusted with more power than is good for
ordinary mortals.
From the Sydney morning papers:—
The N.S.W. Ministry desires to have Duntroon
Military College turned into an agricultural college.
It is suggested that the educational functions of
Duntroon should be transferred to Jervis Bay, where
there is a Naval College.
The Federal college is wanted, of course, for
the training of farmers to settle in N. S.
Wales. And the Ma State can probably get
it or any other Federal building, now or at
any other time, for its territory sur-
rounds Canberra, and it can cut off the

HABET!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At Thursday night’s meeting of the A.L.P. cen-
tral executive it was resolved that the Hon. James
Dooley, by his statements to the Sydney press, laid
automatically placed himself outside the Labor move-
ment.”
He called his critics “crooks uncouth,”
Which may have been—or not- —:
The same unpalatable truth
The blackened kettle of our youth
Learned from the soot-grimed pot.
Yet even pledge-and-caueus kings
Should think before they mock
And hurl the gibe that sticks and stings
At Labor heads who pull the strings—
The which explains, ’midst other things,
Why Dooley takes the knock.
He indicated those who rake
The city gutters through
To find the tools that charges fake
And plots concoct. For Heaven’s sake
Don’t ask me if it’s true!
But Parliamentary heads for less
Have gone upon the block.
That blast of blistering words, I guess,
Amounts to treasonableness.
Thumbs by the score go down for Yes —
And Dooley takes the knock.
Nor any tear for him shall drop
Who wrought the deadly sin,
Who sought to scour the Labor-shop
(Or cracked he did) With soap and mop
And bucket —from within.
’Tis automatic, quite, you know,
His egress from the flock;
He treads the path that all must go
Who sauce the chaps that run the show.
And Catts and Co. may laugh “Ho! ho!”
Now Doolei 7 takes the knock.

Recent happenings in the L.C.A. are of more
than usual interest —particularly to man-
agements, shareholders and policy-holders
associated with the recent crop of insurance
floats. This office began 11 years ago,
primarily to “issue a cheaper and better
form of Industrial policy.” That was to
be accomplished “mainly by reducing the
expense of obtaining proposals and in collect-
ing. premiums.” Storekeepers and others
were to be enrolled as collecting agents, and
their activities were expected to popularise
the office. But the "great possibilities”
faded; and the management soon adopted
the general practice of the trade. The
business was developed steadily without any
costly, elaborate raids for policies, and by
December 31, 1921, £112,927 of insurances
were on the books. But this is what the
actuary found when lie completed his second
quinquennial valuation as at that date: in
10 years £IIB,OOO-odd of revenue had been
received, yet after making provision for the
net liability under policies and charging up
establishment and running exes, there was a
deficiency of £23,801. During the past
year Geo. Smith, formerly Sydney manager,
was called to headquarters. The problem of
what to do with the Industrial section was
solved by one of the latest life infants: the
Commonwealth General, of Sydney, bought
the entire outfit for £0223 cash, the vendor co.
being relieved of all pol.cy liabilities, which
exceeded £lB,OOO. In the, introductory table
establishment and all other charges m, con-
nection with the branch have been debited
front year to year; now the purchase price
and last year’s book surplus go to assist
reserves.
The L.C.A. appears to have made an ex-
cellent deal: it has rid itself of a losing
business, unloaded all responsibility for find-
ing £lB,OOO accumulated liability to policy-
holders, and recouped most, if not nil, its
loss on the venture. On the other hand,
the C.G.A. management announces to its
shareholders that “the business is on a pay-
ing basis,” and that “it will prove a splen-
did investment.” They are matters which
will come up for further consideration by
the “Wild Cat” when the C.G.A. issues its
next accounts. Apart from the question
whether the C.G.A. can made a profit from
business which has shown a heavy loss under
an older organisation, it is astonishing that
a new office should pay £6223 for the right
to acquire £lB,OOO or so of liabilities merely
to establish itself in Victoria. The
significance of the deal is the virtual admis-
sion by the C.G.A. management that it can-
not put an equivalent volume of business on
its books at lower cost. Otherwise, what
need for the purchase? After 11 years’ ex-
perience the L.C.A. admits that it has been
unable to make its Industrial premiums fulfil
the obligations for which they wei'e designed.
With business-writing and establishment more
costly, some of the reckless young offices will
be very fortunate if they escape disaster.
The L.C.A.’s Ordinary operations for the
past seven years have been as follows•

Expenses still take half total receipts (pre-
miums and investment earnings). The high
cost rate, however, is due partly to the large
volume of new business in proportion to old :
last year first premiums contributed £36,695
and renewals £83,155. Assuming that 10 p.c.
of renewal premiums is a fair charge against
old business, then last year the new-business
rate was 169 p.c. That is a stiff price: it
means that almost two years’ premiums from
any proposition must be collected before the
management can hope to put a penny aside
to provide for the policy obligation. Tins
is a problem w hich the new management dis-
cusses, and the directors have laid down this
policy:—*
They have decided not to restrict the amount of
new business, but to set a definite limit on the cost
of obtaining it, and to fix the proportions of the
various classes of business which they will write.
They want all the new business the}' can obtain at
a certain cost, but if the cost exceeds this, then they
are prepared to stand on what they can get at this
price, which, together with the large volume now
in the books, will, they feel satisfied, provide satis-
factory bonuses to policy-holders and reasonable
profits to shareholders.
Lately new business has been difficult to get,
particularly by the younger offices. Conse-
quently costs have, in many instances, been
far in excess of the allowances provided when
premiums were framed, and a lot of this
business cannot be expected to show a profit
for many years.
During the past year the L.C.A. paid its
first bonuses to policy-holders. In their 1921
report the directors had "pleasure in stating”
that the actuary’s second quinquennial in-
vestigation had disclosed "a surplus over the
actuarial liability of £17,233.’' Four-fifths
(£13,787) was appropriated for bonuses, and
the balance (£3446) for shareholders. Owing
to the ill-health of the Industrial branch,
shareholders’ cut was put into reserve. This
surplus suggested that at last Ordinary
operations were giving profits; an examina-
tion of the actuary’s figurings, however, puts
the “surplus” in a different light. Between
1916-21 the Ordinary branch establishment
and organisation and new business accounts
had stood at £15,495. Deducting this amount
from the £188,400 of funds shown by the 1921
accounts left £172,904 of funds represented
by tangible assets to cover an estimated lia-
bility under policies (future interest earn-
ings assumed at 4 p.c.) of £188,563. Actually,
at the close of the tenth year, there was a deficit
of £15,659. Allowing the intangible asset
to remain as it was, the 1916-21 opera-
tions showed a deficiency of £163. But the
actuary did an astonishing thing: he re-
valued assets of an intangible character. He
decided to retain the establishment account
at £4441, but “valued” the new-business
account at £28,450. So the “surplus” of
£17,233 which provided bonuses and divs.
was arrived at by writing up an intangible
asset by £17,396. In the case of a co.
which has charged up all costs against
revenue, there is justification in early
accounts for treating portion of the pre-
liminary costs as goodwill, to be extin-
guished when the concern finds its feet. But
to regard portion of new-business expendi-
ture incurred between the fifth and tenth
years as an asset, for the purpose of finding
a “surplus,” is, to say the least, dangerous.
It is questionable whether an actuary should
associate himself with valuations of intan-
gible assets whose worth is entirely problem-
atic and dependent on factors he cannot
measure in £ s. d. What glorious bonus
feasts big offices like the A.M.P. and M.L.C.
could offer by adopting the L.C.A. actuary’s
methods!
No doubt, the directors’ anxiety to place
the co. in the ranks of bonus-payers was
responsible for happenings a year ago. At
present there is no reason for policy-holders
to be concerned about the deficit in the
Ordinary department. Shareholders’ £71,500
of capital fully covers that more; than twice
over. Owing to the Industrial policy-
liability having been unloaded, the L.C.A.’s
position has become much stronger. At
December 31 last there were net tangible
assets, apart from motor-cars, furnishings,
stationery, etc., with a book value of ap-
proximately £294,000 available to. cover the
liability under Ordinary and Accident poli-
cies. Notwithstanding the questionable
manner in which last year’s “surplus” was
obtained, the L.C.A. does appear to have
turned the corner, and if manager Geo.
Smith adheres to the new policy of business-
getting, better , results can be expected.

Though the Hotel Pacific was put up in the
days of comparatively low building costs
and the site was purchased before land
values soared, this co. has not done as well
as was expected. Liquor-trading restrictions
and high running costs are chiefly to blame.
Last year was the best so far: after provid-
ing for depreciation, the net profit gave a
return of 12jt p.c. on capital. The directors
are wisely developing the co.’s strength, and
only 8 p.c. goes to shareholders. During
the" past five years the average div. rate has
slightly exceeded 8 p.c.; and meanwhile
±SLKK)-i.dd —equal to one-seventh of capital
—has been added to reserves. Portion of
this accumulated profit has been used to
effect hotel-improvements, but the liquid pos-
ition has also been assisted. This compari-
son goes back five and ten years:—

Besides £35,000 of paid capital, the co. is
working on £20,000 of debentures. Current
debts at December 31 amounted to £4453,
and against that were liquid assets —stocks,
book debts and cash —totting up £6621.

Adjustments make the profits shown in the
table smaller than those disclosed by the
accounts. For instance, when £6092 was
claimed for the financial year ended January,
1922, no provision had been made for taxes:
£614 has since been paid into the Treasuries
and £5OO also went into a bonus fund. The
£4230 claimed for the past year is subject
to similar deductions. So the 6 p.c. divs.
on ordinaries and 2nd prefs. and 7 p.c. on
Ist prefs. were probably only just about
earned. Prior to the set-back caused by
slumped prices, 8 p.c. bad been paid regularly
on the three classes of shares; but though
latest profits are around the level which
formerly permitted that rate, the capitalisa-
tion of £lO,OOO of reserves two years ago
and the raising of additional cash-paid capi-
tal has upset the balance. The bonus issue
was an inducement to holders to put in new
funds to ease the strain of more costly
stocks. There is now £60,000 of capital,
compared with £40,000 three years ago, so
8 p.c. would call for £4BOO. Latest gross
profits at £25,130 were £10,848 less than
those of two years ago: meanwhile exes,
have declined only £6OOl to £20,900. Of
course, trading during that period was not
normal; and last year the co. continued to
suffer the effects of the slump.

The outstanding feature of Sargent’s
latest accounts is that recent purchases have
taken the book value of freehold property
to £I7I,SCO, which is £6553 more than paid
capital. There is another £14,700 in lease-
holds. Of course, mortgages have helped to
finance property purchases;
about 40 p.c. of the total—has been so
borrowed. But no less than £117,500 of the
co.’s total funds of £186,258 is in property,
independent of furnishings. In view of this
investment the divs. of 10 p.c., and some-
times a bit more, emphasise the very hand-
some profits there are in the tea-and-cake
operations. Net earnings for the past six
months were not quite so large as those
for the June half, but another £lOOO has
gone into the taxation reserve and may not
be taken by current assessments. Twelve
months ago £6OOO was voted to the fund and
is still intact. Altogether there is now
f 15,0€0 in the taxation reserve, and all _of
it could probably be regarded as genuine
accumulated profit.
In this comparison of balance-sheet
figures the book value of properties is given
less mortgages, which, of course, are con-
sequently not included with liabilities: —

Another view of how handsomely the co. has
done can be got by measuring balance-sheet
movements over a period of years. Since 1910
£50,247 has been got in from new shares
and premiums thereon, and book values have
shown this expansion: fixed assets ( less
mortgages), £142,910; excess of liquid assets
over current liabilities, £4(575. Surplus
profits had visibly improved the co. by
£97,838; and there may meantime have been
appreciation not visible —the enhanced value
of long-held properties, for instance. The
present volume of reserves does not indi-
cate such handsome results : throughout the
table goodwill (£45,000) has not been re-
garded as an asset. That intangible item
was written off five years ago. Considering
the numerous failures in the business, this
co.’s performances have been astonishing,
particularly in view of the fact that the
balance-sheet improvements have been
effected after paying 10 p.c. regularly down
to 1919, and for the past three years an
average of almost 12 p.c. p.a. on capital
inflated by £25,000 of reserve transfers.

To give 8 p.c. on capital the co. need earn
not quite 4 p.c. on its funds: there are
£117,803 of reserves to assist £113.539 of
shai-eliolders’ scrip. So this Invercargill co.
has been very comfortably situated to weather
the depression in the frozen-meat trade. It
may be better-off than the accounts disclose,
for, parcelled with the £75,213 of sundry
creditors at December 31, there were un-
specified reserves for '‘taxation and contin-
gent liabilities” which may not be drawn
upon. Shareholders who were in before the
war boom have done much better than the
8 p.c. indicates: owing to the capitalisation
of £45,522 —which, incidentally, was accom-
panied by a cash bonus of £22,7ol—that rate
of div. gives one-third more than 10 p.c. did
prior to 1919. At present the outlook for
the trade is not brilliant, but this co. can

Domara River Plantations, Ltd.—
Eighteen months ago, when owing to the
collapse of world’s markets this Melbourne-
owned Papuan venture had 'no outlet for its ;
produce, £12,000 of five-year debentures
carrying 15 p.c. p.a. were subscribed to main-
toin_ the plantation. By December 31, 1921,
£5456 had been called in, and that financial
year closed with a loss of £2708. For the
past 12 months £3.180 of debenture instal-
ments were collected, and after paying £lllO
debenture interest and allowing £394 for
. depreciation a loss of £2230 showed up. A
little rubber-tapping was done during the
year, but no sales were made. Nevertheless,
the period benefited by taking 42771 b. into
the accounts at Is. per lb. and 19411 b. more
at 101 d., together £299. Meanwhile, copra
operations were unsatisfactory: 46 tons were
turned out, but at least 10 tons were lost
by inefficient methods, unfavorable weather
and insect ravages. A dryer has now been
installed, and better results can be hoped
for. Also, the rubber market has improved
sufficiently to give Domara a small margin
of profit on production. The directors new
hope that the final instalment on the deben-
tures will not be required, though the co. is
faced with expenditure to clean up its planted
areas. The success of the debenture issue
undoubtedly saved the co.—so far as it is
saved. At December 31 only £l5B was owirg
to outs:'de creditors, but including accrued
debenture interest, directors’ fees and
accrued native wages debts totted up £921.

now producing siliciou's ore for the smelters,
and has some encouraging carbonate develop-
ments in the higher levels. South Blocks
(Zinc Corporation) is now working, and
althoUgh the ore has a low silver tenor, the
lay-out of the mine should favorably

improved and will be a big help. Output
from the South has improved; between 8600

closed. The slime dumps are about finished,
and tailings dumps will disappear in a few

w’as £14.600; three divs. absorbed £9OOO,
and £2090 was paid off bank overdraft, leav-
ing it at £2713.' It is novel financing for a
no-liability co. to be burdened with a big
overdraft whilst paying divs. Mine-develop-
ments are reported to be satisfactory. A
subsidiary co. is to be formed to work the
northern section of the dyke—3o,ooo fully-
paid shares are to be allotted to shareholders
in the present co., and they have the prefer-
ence right to take up 30,000 shares at ss.

New Blue (Bendigo) return last week
was 6380 z. from 640 tons. The receipt of
£l3OO gold premium enabled the directors to
declare a div. of 2s. 6d. per share. For the
current year 5500 tons have been crushed for
51080 z., and 6s. 6d. per share (£14.625) has
been distributed. All productive work since
the reconstruction of the co. has been done
on a western formation about which little,
if anything, was known in former times. Re-
eently a. crosscut was started to the east,
200 ft. south of No. 3 shaft; in a few feet
this intersected the original main reef, and
to date 25ft. has been driven in quartz
carrying good values, with similar stone still
in the face. Shareholders have decided not
to purchase a battery at present.

Central Blue, Bendigo, has been allotted
£l5OO by the Victorian Government on the
£ for £ basis for shaft-sinking. Present
depth is 2000 ft., but no payable values have
been disclosed below about 600 ft. The bot-
tom of the shaft is almost in “centre” conn-
try, and its nearness to the blue slates wh'ch
are yielding so well in the New Blue (less
than a mile distant) is considered to “offer
a most inviting objective for shaft-sinking.”
From shallow levels Central Blue paid nearly
£150,000 in divs. in three or four years.
* * * *
From Bendigo :—•
The par. (B. l/3/’23) concerning the Hercules and
Monument mines expresses opinions quite contrary
to those held by many good men on the field. They
think these two mines, on present showing, the
champion “pups” from the B.A.G. kennels. It is
quite true that Hercules is a “good, old has-
been.” Its ground contains the original Her-
eules, Victoria Gold Mines, Victoria Consols
and Irbnbark mines, which paid over £500,000
in divs. But it is not fair to inferentially
class it as a “never-to-be-again.” It may seem
anomalous to say that work which is being done in a
mine at depths between 1300 and 1500 feet is almost
new prospecting, but such is the case. Hercules and
associated mines owe their fame almost solely to the
productiveness of the New Chum reef. It was not
until the past few years that any attention was
paid to the parallel Sheepshead line. It is the
same massive formation as at the southern end
(New Blue section), and presents the same character
of being very rich in patches; erratic returns from
trial crushings from development work can give only
an approximate idea of the average value, but if it
can maintain “only 7dwt.” it will not be goods
to be despised. The co.’s holding is nearly 5000 ft.
along this formation, which at the depth of present
workings is intact for the whole distance.
What possibilities there are here for a big mine!
Monument Hill, it must be admitted, is more of
a gambling chance. It has no brilliant : golden past
to commend it, but the management has located
gold in payable quantities exactly where they expected
to get it. It is a persistent formation, which, for
miles, is untried. The present development is con-
sidered, sufficient to justify the hope that it will
lead to permanency. On the theory of the parallel-
ism of pay-ore shoots, Monument Hill is in a favored
position. *
* * * *
“Bendigonian” : An event of pretty wide
significance will be the success or failure of
the recently-formed Nell Gwynne Co. The
mine is situated at Diamond Hill, on the
southern end of the New Chum series of
reefs. English cos. operated extensively there
for years, being introduced by H. J. Hether-
ington over 35 years ago. They had occa-
sional runs of success, but in the aggregate
the results spelt failure, except inthe respect
that by installing improved appliances they
established Australian records for econom cal
mining and treatment. As misfortune would
have it, concurrent with reduction of ex-
penses, there was a decrease in values. On
the cancellation of the Nell Gwynne lease it
was re-pegged by a co-operative party of
managers, shift-bosses and miners, who had
an idea that a large body of spurs known to
exist between two parallel lode bodies was
worth investigating. One-half of the party
did the manual work on half wages which
were contributed by the other half. They
continued an old crosscut from the Nell
shaft at 250 ft., and soon encountered the
spurry formation, which proved to be SOft.
wide. A short rise connected with an old
shaft. The whole of the material broken
from crosscut and rise—over 100 tons—
yielded 6dwt. per ton. Excluding barren
bars, which may be broken out and used as
filling or left as pillars, it is estimated that
about SOft. will yield about lOdwt. per ton.
The formation is intact through this lease,
and in adjoining blocks for over a mile here
and there are some old-time workings from
which, in places, rich yields are said to have
been won. On visible evidence the prospect
is hopeful. Success at the Nell Gwynne will
mean big work to be undertaken by three
local cos., and will give a stimulus to similar
prospecting work along the line which has
been worked from Spring Gully to Long
Gully—fully three miles—and also on other
lines. The' new co. proposes to erect a 10-
stamp mill to make thorough determinative
tests of the huge formation. The mortar-
blocks of a 30-stamp mill are still in posi-
tion, and already there is wagering as to
whether they will be called into requisition
once more.

“Ajax” : Reference to official reports con-
firms the statements of “J.C.”(B. 28/12/’22)
as to four lines of bores covering an area
of 14 miles proving the existence of an exten-
sive deep-lead system in the Mount Mitchell
district, about 25 miles N.-W. of Ballarat.
The area bored is on a confluence of the
West Ballarat, Avoca and Beaufort deep-
lead systems. Most of the bores bottomed
in heavy wash, and prospects of gold are
recorded. Deep-lead mining must be very
much out of favor when an unworked area
presenting such possibilities is ignored. As
the old river has crossed reef-bearing Silurian
rocks, it would be contrary to the rule if the
wash on the bottom does not carry payable
values in sections. What has been done by
the Government is merely scout boring, and
the results are such as to justify close
sampling. If Private Enterprise is not equal
to making such a test, the Government ought
to undertake it, making a special reservation
of a likely area, and in the event of success
attending the further sampling, submitting
the area to lease under competition.
The Manxman line of reef, five miles north
of Bullfinch (W.A.), was iound by prospec-
tors Bruce and Barnett in 1911. Quartz-
floaters containing values up to 20oz. per
ton were numerous over a length of 60 chains
and, after much prospecting, a narrow quartz
vein was located on the Manxman lease.
This, although high in gold content, proved
unprofitable, principally owing to gold being
confined to streaks. Prospectors, however,
stuck to the line, and, eventually, on the
Manxman South Extended, what is appar-
ently a continuation of the Manxman reef
was picked up. During early operations tins
reef was also found to be slim, although
crushings gave average yields exceeding 3oz.
per ton. Present owners, Barr and Clements,
invested their bullion returns in deen-sinking
and the result is the d’seovery, at 200 ft. of
a reef 10ft. wide worth in parts 4oz. They
are erecting their own treatment plant, and
turning a deaf ear to offers of up to £30,000
spot-cash.
Mount Quamby (N.Q.) half-yearly report
to January 31 records the following crush-
ings: 333 tons from C cut, 960 z. average
sciwt. 18gr.) ; B cut, 306 tons, 460 z. (3dwt.) ;
A cut 300 tons for 430 z. (2dwt. 21gr.). Re-
ceipts from gold were £736, and working
costs £lB3O. The show has failed to fulfil
the expectations founded on “previous small
tests and assay results.” It is evi-
dently very low-grade, and any chance of
success depends on a large output, for which
there is no adequate water supply at pre-
sent. Ore reserves are to be thoroughly
tested to ascertain whether heavy outlay ou
w T ater supply and plant wrnuld be justified.
Prospecting work is. being actively pursued
on several shows at Brookfield, near Bris-
bane, notably the Eclipse and Surprise. At
the latter the shaft is now down 80ft. oti
an Sin. reef, with assays up to 40z., but
values are up and down. The Eclipse dur-
ing the past week has struck another heavy
mineral leader assaying lOoz. It is reported
that as much as £3OO has been paid for a
twentieth interest, but there is not nearly
enough ore in sight to justify such a valua-
tion, though there is a likely chance of
crosscutting striking payable veins. The
new field is certainly worth prospecting, but
it has been boomed overmuch.
The gold discovery at the Six-Mile, Cook-
town, reported early last year, is a poor
thing. The indications within 20ft. of the
surface looked as if they might lead to some-
thing, moderately good, but down to 80ft. the
veins are small, and there is only a slender
chance that it will be anything better than
a prospectors’ show.
For the six months to December Tyrcon-
nell, Ivingsborough (N.Q.), won 15050 z.
from 1406 tons, and the grade for the last
monthly run during that period was almost
lloz. At the first clean-up this year values
fell to 17dwt. —128 oz. fromM.so tons. #
The Queensland Government is acquiring
the output of sapphires at Anakie, where pri-
vate buyers have been operating recently. A
grader has been sent to the field, and the
Department will pay 95 p.c. of the market
value on delivery, the exes, of grading, mar-
keting, e’tc., to come out of the balance. Only
a small margin of safety is provided, and very
much depends upon careful grading.
The caution with which the “Wild Cat”
viewed the news of a very good shoot at
the 580 ft. in the old Vailcan, Irvinebank
(N.Q.), seems to have been justified. Latest
information is that the shoot is small and
has practically cut out. The last x’ecorded
crushing for the tributors was 53 tons for
3 tons Scwt., worth £315, but this did not
include the good stuff from the new shoot.
There was no clean-up for January.
* * *
Spurred on by the success of the Irishman
and Rainbow syndicates, interest is being
revived in other tin-shows long dormant in
llerberton (N.Q.). John Newell and J. W.
Moule have recently acquired Trembath’s
Good Friday, and propose to test the lower
workings thoroughly. The old Ly-ee-Moon
is also being resurrected, and a local crowd
is going after the lost shoot with enthusi-
asm and a lot of cash.
“Ewan”: The Kangaroo' Hills (N.Q.)
battery puts the Great Northern record (B.
8/2/’23) quite in the shade. For 14 weeks
ending June 17, 1922, it crushed public ore
as follows: Sardine, 404 tons for ’429 tons
tin concentrates; Canary, 30 tons for 12
tons; four small lots amounting to 50 tons
for 3 tons. The total w r as 490 tons for
144 tons black tin, an average of 29.4 p.c.
W. M. Haenke, of Ipswich (Q.), is open-
ing up the new coal area at Injune Creek,
near Roma, reported on recently by Dr. Jen-
sen. There is a 3ft. to 4ft. seam at a
handy depth near the railway line. The
fuel runs about 12 p.c. ash. Haenke is one
of the busiest men in the coal business at
Ipswich; he has interests in Perrys Nob,
near Rosewood, and several of the Bun-
damba collieries. #
Austral Malay’s scouting for new proper-
ties has brought two promising areas under
consideration. In Lower Burma 450 acres
claimed to average 16ft. deep of tin
are being tested. So far 24 trial bores put
down have substantiated the values obtained
by the vendor-prospectors. The other option
is a large gold area in Upper Burma. The
tin proposition is to be thoroughly tested
before gold-dredging possibilities are investi-
gated.
W. J. Mulligan, former manager of the
Cangai copper-mine, considers that power
from the Nymboida will give that N. S.
Wales show a new lease of life._ In 1917
104 tons copper was won from 197 tons ore,
and Mulligan and others associated with
him declare that there is still nlenty of Irgh-
grade stuff in the mine, and that hydro-elec-
tric power will so reduce costs as to
justify re-opening.
“Nollig” : Samples of the galena and oxi-
dised ore from the recently-discovered Big
Ben lode, nor’-east of the Western mine,
Zeehan (Tas.), have given the following,
assavs: Galena, SO p.c. lead and ISOoz. silver
oxidised ore, 4140 z. silver and nearly 50 p.c,
lead. An assay of the capping of the lode
where it was picked up 250 ft. north of the
original discovery showed 29.5 p.c. lead and
14oz. silver.
♦ * * *
“Talpa” in reply :
“Physico-chemist’s” views (B. 8/2/’23) seem to
me to be old bones resuscitated. Probably every-
one acquainted with oil knows something of Bertha-
lot’s and Mendelief’s hypotheses, that petroleum
is formed by the action of steam on metallic car-
bides. These views were advanced in 1866 and
1877, so could hardly be called new. Coste is a
consistent advocate of this theory, but there are so
many objections to it that practically all geologists
have abandoned it, although chemists are naturally
inclined towards it owing to their successes in the
synthetic manufacture of other compounds.
One of the greatest difficulties that the chemist
has to explain is that oil experimentally derived
from inorganic material is optically inert, whilst
natural petroleum is optically active, this property
being ascribed to the presence of alcohols which
occur in the fats derived from animals and vege-
tables.
Another difficulty associated with the deep-seated
origin of petroleum is that oil-sands are discovered
with barren sands above and below them, the oil
area being often in the form of a lens, and with
no possibility of being fed from below; in fact,
if it were not for the presence of impervious beds
at the top and bottom of the lens, the petroleum
would be so widely dispersed in the reservoir rock
as to make commercial production an impossibility.
As all oil-men know, it is useless to look for oil
in quantity and in any other than sedimentary
rocks, and the largest proportion of the world's
oil is recovered from the tertiaries, not from the
deep-seated rocks. The pressure of mountain masses
cannot be cited as the direct cause of the develop-
ment of petroleum, as there are so many exceptions.
“Pbysico-chemist” quotes the Appalachians and the
Urals as examples. These are not great mountain
systems; the former rises to an extreme height of
6700 ft. in North Carolina —where, by the bye,
there is no petroleum—and the latter to 6000 ft.
above sea level in the Central Urals, but in many
places is so insignificant that travellers cannot dis-
tinguish it from the lowlands. The Great Dividing
Range to the North-west of Roma is quite as im-
portant in body of material as the Urals.
How can the great midcontinent oilfields of the
U.S.A. be accounted for on this hypothesis? They
are far from any mountain masses, being midway
between the Rockies and the Appalachians. What
about Commodore Rivadayia, on the south-east coast
of the Argentine, and Natalia, in Alaska, not to
mention Trinidad and the Egyptian fields?
1 may be incorrect in stating Dr. David White's
figures for the potential oil resources of the Pacific
Basin, but this is extracted from his speech as
reported in the Oil and Gas Journal (26/10/’23) :
North America, including Alaska, Western Canada,
Western United States, and one half of Mexico’s
reserves, 6,000,000,000 barrels; Eastern Asia, includ-
ing the Japanese Empire, 7,000,000,000 barrels;
Australia, 4,000.000,000 barrels; South and Central
America, 9,000,000,000 barrels.

“Henri Singemoine”: The disputants on
the church-census issue have overlooked, or
failed to understand, the most interesting
implication of the figures. These do not
indicate a spiritual swing-over to any church,
and certainly not to the Anglican Church,
which, on attendance figures, is far weaker
than, say, the Presbyterian Church. What
they do prove is that Australia is abound-
ingly prosperous. The fashionable religion
throughout the Commonwealth is Anglican-
ism, and all over the world, when people
make money, a proportion of them desert the
humbler sects. How many Wesleyan peers
are there in England to-day? Yet a large
number of the Lloyd George peerages went
to members of this, or allied, denominations.
The moment a French Jansenist makes a
great deal of money he tries to marry into
a Faubourg St. Germain family, and if
there are any prospects of success he and
his become Catholics. In Australia since
the war an enormous number of new pluto-
crats have come to the front, and many of
them have social ambitions. . The inevitable
reaction is that snobbish Wesleyans, Con-
gregationalists, Plymouth Brethren, etc.,
begin to look towards those fanes where the
important ones of the. land worship; and,
even if they don’t go so far as to invest in
pews, they begin to speak of themselves as
Anglicans, and, ivhen the census-taker calls,
write themselves down as such. If it were
constitutionally possible for the royal family
to join the Salvation Army, and if they did
so, 75 per cent, of Australian profiteers
would be wearing scarlet guernseys and
banging drums within a generation.

worth —what a name ! —had divested a cripple
of his crutches and pushed him into the arms
of a helper, he would say, “Now you’re all
right,” and proceed to wholesale curing. His
most wonderful strain on Faith, however,
was the Hanky Heal. In response to his
appeal for hankies, hundreds were sent in,
each marked with the sufferer’s name and
address. These would be heaped before Mr.
Wigglesworth, who would say prayers over
the pile, and then apply a drop of oil to each
scrap of cotton. They were then restored
to the senders with instructions to apply the
anointed square to the afflicted part and v ait
patiently for results. After that surely Mr.
Hickson won’t find any sick cases left to be
cured in Maoriland.
DESTINY.
“Cleared out with every penny she had!”
“She should never have married him.”
“She wouldn’t have, only a fortune-teller told her to take precautions against burglars."
“Horton”: Of all the war-time mascots,
animate or inanimate, the strangest I know
of was a Maori rush kilt, known as a piu-piu,
which was worn at Jutland by the command-
ing-officer of H.M.S. New Zealand. This
charm was the gift of a Maori chief, who,
in presenting it, some time before the war,
prophesied that one day the ship and her
crew would see action, and indicated the fore-
top the after turret and the conning-tower
as vulnerable spots. The New Zealand was
about to be paid off at the time, so little
notice was taken of his prophecy; but, as it
turned out, the same crew took part in the
Jutland action. The Huns registered only
one hit on the battle-cruiser, a large shell
striking her on the after-turret, but it looked
as though the Maori chief’s, prophecy might
have a chance of further fulfilment when
later —in November, ’17 —several Herman
cruisers were sighted from the crow’s nest.
On the order for “action stations” being
given, an excited rating was observed shin-
ning up the ladder leading to the upper
bridge. For a moment it seemed to those
below that he had run amok, but on reaching
his objective he was heard to shout: “It]s
all right, mateys; the old man’s got his
skirt on !”
“Henry Bateson”: The pakeha system of
trying a man for murder interested Hori
hugelv in the early days. He apparently re-
garded the Judge who passed sentence of
death much as the white man regards the
actual executioner, and would travel many
miles just to catch a glimpse of him. In
1855 the Tauranga natives were sufficiently
impressed with the English law to attempt
an imitation of it. One native woman had
drowned another. A native tribunal sen-
tenced her to death, but after that the pro-
cess differed. There was no respite between
the sentence and the execution, and instead
of hanging the condemned they tapped her
on the head with a greenstone mere. It is
worth noting that years prior to this, m
1842, the first Maori murderer condemned
to death by English law complained bitterly
of not being killed immediately, sentence was
pronounced. It’s a question if the savage
isn’t more logical and humane in some of his
ideas than the heirs of all the ages.
“Speculum”: It is rather wonderful how
the Navy provides for all things. There is
even a set of “service-pattern” nicknames for
persons owning certain surnames. Thus all
Halls ana Clarkes are called “Nobby,” and
there are sailors, from admirals to O.D.’s,
answering to the hail of “Tug” Wilson,
“Pincher” Martin, “Shiner” Wright, “Pus-
ser” Holmes, “Taff” Evans, “Spud” Murphy,
“Nick” Carter and “Pedlar” Palmer. In
some cases a surname has carried its own
common nickname for scores of years. In-
cidentally, the service itself is personified
as “Andrew Millar.” Apropos the quarter-
deck salute (B. 22/2/’23), a naval explana-
tion is that all persons coming close to the
shrine then placed at the break of the poop
or under the stern lamp used to cross them-
selves in the manner prescribed by Holy
Church. This in time degenerated into the
making of the sign of the cross with the fore-
finger on the forehead, and later into a mere
touching of the forelock. The military salute
has quite another origin. Free men, i.e.,
men entitled to bear arms, on meeting one
another or a social superior, signified their
peaceful intentions by holding up the empty
and extended right hand to the level of the
oar. Knights travelling round looking for
trouble wore the visors of their helmets
down and raised the right hand to lift the
visor. The military salute thus appears to
be a sign of greeting between friends; the
naval salute a relic of Catholic ritual.
In short order :
Necessity knows no lawyer.
Love is both a malady and an entertainment.
Give small heed to talk of the marvellous past.
Yesterday is seen in long perspective; to-day point
blank.
To most people high heaven is a bureau for chc
lodgment of complaints.
To a bald man a hat is not merely a cover; it
is a sanctuary.
Misplace seriousness ever so little, and you get
burlesque.
Diana hunted the doe ; her modern counterpart
hunts the bucks.
An old hen with a lone chick is not more primi-
tive than a civilised mother with her first babe.

“Harold Hardupp”: One Sydney girl is
said to have been “rescued” on half-a-dozen
beaches. Her capacity for getting caught
in an undertow that isn’t noticeable to other
people amounts almost to genius. But her
luck is out. Of the men who have helped
her all but one have turned out to be mar-
ried, or “as good as married.” The one
exception was a rescuer who, asked to call
at the lady’s home so that her parents might
thank him, said brutally that women who
were fools enough to get into trouble in
the surf were a dam’ nuisance, and he didn’t
want anything to do with ’em. Seeking for
romance in the surf appears to be a thank-
less pursuit.

“Whitehall” on the high cost of royalties:
Philosophers have been remarking irritably ever
since Tutankhamen’s time (and no doubt they did
it thousands of years before the Egyptian monarch
had his insanely expensive funeral) that royalties
simply cannot get the true focus of public opinion
in regard to themselves. The latest proof of it is
the insistence of the Bonar Law Government —
inspired, of course, by the Court —that £35,000 per
annum shall be allowed to the Duke of York. The
Duke, like his sister, chose an enormously rich family
to marry into. He will not be called upon to
spend a farthing in official entertainments. His
entire services to the nation will consist in taking
over a bazaar or a bov-scout review from the Prince —
duties he has hitherto performed for £lO,OOO a
year. In fact, the harried taxpayers of Britain,
wrestling heroically as they are with the biggest debt
in history, are being asked to provide the interest on>
about a million sterling, to keep an able-bodied young
sportsman in 500-guinea hunters and the like. The
building of Versailles is said to have been responsible
for the downfall of the Bourbons. But the French
nation has something to show for its 40 millions. In
fact, if Versailles were placed on the market, with
all the available furniture and art treasures that
it contained when Marie Antoinette went to the
scaffold, a Yankee syndicate would probably rush it
at 40 millions. The inexcusable feature of the huge
sums a monarchical country lavishes on its prince-
lings is that almost every shilling represents money
thrown down the sink. Even the admittedly suc-
cessful tours made by the Prince of Males are
examples in point. Let it be granted that where
loyalty was languishing he fanned it into a name,
and that, in already loyal countries, such as Aus-
tralia, a section of the community went mad about
him. It yet remains indisputably true that, if
the Empire had never seen him, and only knew him
as one who had decided to hand over seven-eighths
of his income to an unemployment fund, and remain
frugally at home, he would be even more admirec
than lie is to-day. There is a crying demand at
the moment for royalties who will live within their
subjects’ means.

“Jackaburra” : Williams is a regular week-
ender at a Melbourne seaside place during
the snapper season, and was returning one
Sunday evening when a ticket-checker caught
him with his No. 9’s resting on the carriage
seat. It cost the by-law breaker 7s. 6a. and a
guinea costs. A few weeks ago Williams
was again returning from his weekly excur-
sion, and met the ticket-checker on the rail-
way platform. The sportsman, to the othcia; s
surprise, gripped his hand, g'enially dis-
claiming all ill-feeling. In a few minutes
the pair became quite brotherly, so much so
that the checker was induced to accept a tew
freshly-caught fish, small but appetising to
the eye, and both boarded the next train to
town. At Brighton Williams left the tram
and rang up Russell-street, telling them that
a man with undersized fish was on board.
When the checker arrived at Flinders-street
he was met by two John Hops. This time
the beak said “£5 and costs, or 14 days.
Williams is still chuckling, but he always
makes sure that his bedroom-door and win-
dow are locked before he turns in.

“10-2-4” : Detectives appear to be the same
in every land and in every age. In Mark
Twain’s “The Stolen White Elephant” the
collective intellect of the U.S. detective force
was addressed to the discovery of the vast
animal; and they eventually did detect it by
the smell of its corpse in a cellar at Police
Headquarters. The Victorian detectives failed
to find Bertha Goughian in life. One dav
a Dago arrives in a Melbourne hospital
carrving a full cargo of bullets and informs
them that the girl has been murdered. They
express incredulity, whereupon he tells them
where a body is to be found that has been
disposed of. to say the least of it, in an irre-
gular manner. Their suspicions are at
length aroused, and they effect certain
arrests —again under the foreign gentleman s
direction. With similar assistance the dull-
est policeman that ever padded a remote

the only requisites being a sense of hearing

and of smell and a pair of handcuffs. It is
all very like Mark Twain’s yarn, and in no-
thing more than the veneration with which a
fool-press is prepared to regard these men who
detected nothing of a suspicious nature —
nor ever would have, apparently—unless
and until their faces had been pushed full
into the mystery’s abhorrent depths.

A stout person sees famine ahead: —
I am not old, yet I can remember when almost
every hotel in Europe fed its patrons on the table
d’hote system. One summer I went, to Lake Como
and found that the. chief hotels at Cadenabbia, Menag-
gio, etc., had started each an d la carte room. The
thin end of the wedge. You proved your social
status by deserting the cheaper, though equally .good,
table at which the meal was ready for one where it
wasn’t, or pretended it. wasn’t —usually the latter.
The thing spread, and within five years there were
few table d’hote meals to be had in France and Italy.
London followed suitv--though to this day there are a
few old places .where you are not compelled'to pay
for an entire shoulder of l imb because you want a
couple of slices of the animal. The swindle of the
a la carte system is that, as a rule, the feeder
pays four or. five times as much: as he did under
the other arrangement, ami gets the. same food. It
is inevitable that it should be so. A chef can take
a personal interest in Only, a limited number, of meals.
Joseph’s, in Paris, rarely contained more than 30
diners: Willis’s Rooms, in London, when Edouard

was cooking there, usually had less—in fact, the
downstairs room on which he concentrated wouldn’t
hold many more. We know that “where everyone
is somebody then- no one’s anybody” ; and so it is
with food. Once all the bigger Australian hotels
adopt the a la carte system—and according to my
calculations that dark day is only a year or so dis-
tant —the standard of high-class cooking, which has
risen, will slump once more. We shall be back,
as so many of the big London and Paris restaurants
are, to table d’hote food —but at a la carte prices.
“The Deacon” : Can nothing be done to-
wards standardising funerals? When the
shock of death is
fresh, few people can
bring themselves to
haggle about the price
of interment or to
show apparent miser-
liness about the sham
trappings of the
mourning. “The best
—and plenty of it,”
says the sorrowing-
widow, and the family
is behind her —till the
bill comes in. And
all. this conventional
mummery really pro-
fits nobody except the
undertaker. The R.C.
Church has stead-
fastly set its autho-
rity against expensive
wreaths and gaudy
caskets, and thus has
done something to re-
duce the high cost of
dying, but an urgent
need still exists to
prevent people of
other creeds from
being exploited, as
they are daily. The
beautiful Jewish fun-
eral is an object-
lesson to all Chris-
tians, not only in its
reverence blit in its
absolute economy. The
N.S.W, Parliament
has had but one un-
dertaker in its ranks
of recent years—old
Jabez Wright. “I’m
not positive that Pri-
vate Enterprise is a
■ bad thing,” he said—
“except in my own
business. I know that ought to be taken
.out of our hands.”
“Thorold”: If “Caballer” (B. 8/2/’23)
will look up a neglected atlas lie will find
that Norfolk was a far more unsuitable loca-
tion than the English Midlands in which to
build enemy-smashing tankk, being much too
handy to air-
fiends. The Mid-
lands were the
main birthplace of
the monsters, for
even if the people
who gave the big-
war contracts were
idiots they
couldn’t find works
anywhere in Nor-
folk big enough to
turn out anything
more than a frac-
tion of require-
ments. Also, the
eastern counties
teemed with
hybrid . seafarers,
who were poten-
ti a 1 spies and
go s sip s. Lloyd
George certainly
made one of his big-
gest bloomers when
he announced that
16 factories were
preparing a sur-
prise for Fritz, and
Philip. Gibbs and
every other war-
writer on the
Fre n e h fro n t
quickly subsided,
after emitting the
first inspired gush
about the tanks,
into admitting that
they hadn’t alto-
gether done the
deeds set down for
them. If those
‘wonderful, ludi-
crous, lolloping en-
gines,” as Gibbs
first called them,
did more at Flers
and other places
later than they did
in their first hop-
over, then Gibbs
and his mates and
British G.H.Q.
strangely failed to
let their country
into the encourag-
ing secret. Nobody contends that the tanks
were not useful, but Lloyd George in his
.temperamental exuberance and Matahan,
the dancer, with her secret-wheedling blan-
dishments. certainly robbed them of much
of their surprise effect;
“David”: If Malapropisms are off, how’s
this for mixed metaphors? Three of us were
discussing the recent M.L. election campaign,
and the prohib. question came along for judg-
ment. Quoth one Sullivan, pleader for sun-
dry drunks at the police court: '“Well. I
believe in prohibition—-I always have. But
I couldn’t come out into the open over it;
SMOOTHING IT OVER.

HIS HOMER ( affably ) : “Tut, tut, witness! I’m, sure learned coun-
sel doesn’t mean you to take him seriously.”
you can’t expect a man to cut the bread and
butter from under his own feet.”
“Sarn Major”: Herewith paragraph 95 of
Routine Orders of the Ist Divvy, dated
1/5/1917:
It has been observed that some officers and other
, ranks are under the impression that there are ranks
known as “King’s Sergeant’’ and King’s Corporal”
which carry with them certain privileges. It is to
be clearly understood and explained to all ranks
that:
(a) There is no such rank or title as “King’s
Sergeant” or “King’s Corporal” ;
(b) There are no legal privileges attached to any
Commissioned or Warrant or Non-commis-
sioned rank beyond those set forth in Army
Act and King’s Regulations;
(c) Promotion for gallantry or good service in
the field does not endow the recipient with
any privileges, legal or social, beyond those
which the holder would be entitled had he
gained that rank in the ordinary manner.
The above R.O. was- promulgated in 3rd
M. D. Orders of 24/S/T7, and “Digger’s
Batman” (B. 22/2/’23) can take the count
accordingly.
“0.K.”: Thirty-five years ago Georgn
Augustus Sal.a wrote of the Australian larri-
kin that he was a "'strictly sober young
.blackguard,”: and since then the disease has
spread to the more estimable classes. One
cannot cast six pebbles at a crowd without
hitting a teetotaller. Last week there was
■a bush-fire in Fern Tree Gully (Vic.}, and
after the local fire-fighters (portion of a
splendidly-organised force that did great
work for miles around) had been toiling for
hours, a tempter came with a keg of beer
from the wicked pub. Did the . fire-fighters
open their mouths to the enemy? They did
not. Out of a band of, say, 36, not more
than half-a-dozen were beer-drinkers even in
moderation. The others • stood listening for
the fire-fighters’ summons, from siren whistle,
auction bell or the rattle of a kerosene-tin,
and bade the bloke with the beer fade away.
Crosbie, the Y.M.C.A. secretary, and four of
his young men, assisted in this sharp repulse
of the beer-keg.
“Sol M.” : That nowadays rather, rare mys-
tery, a religious revival, has struck Belfast
(Ireland), just as it did Peterhead (Scot'
land) and adjacent parts a while ago. There
are no cast-iron rules for revivals, any more
than for waterspouts, and they may arise
in the most unpromising circumstances. The
dullest books in the Bible are the pair of
Chronicles, and there are few duller ones
out of it. About, the dullest verses are the
first four, which drone along thus : :
1. Adam, Sheth, Enosh.
2. Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered.
3. Henoch, Methuselah, Lamech.
•1. Noah, Shorn, Ham and Japheth.
Yet it is recorded that on a stuffy afternoon,
in a tin church, a parson who was no elocu-
tionist had just got as far as Ham when a
man and a woman in different parts of the
building leaped up crying that they were
saved. The whole congregation took the ih-
fection, and cried out that it was saved, and
then the street was saved, and after that the
town got it. This sort of furore dies away
as unaccountably as it arises, and where the
revival goes between revivals is as hard to
tell as what becomes of Christmas between
Christmases.

"‘Adelaide”: The City Council here is
seriously considering a proposal to “obtain
power to acquire such lands and buildings
as may be deemed necessary for street im-
provement.” The arrangement made by
Colonel Light, of a practically square city,
with nine broad streets running east and
west, but only- three running north and
south, has caused great congestion in the
various narrow north-and-south lanes, arbi-
trary and not continuous, which have sprung
up since. The most notable of these, being
in the busiest quarter, is Gawler-plaee,
which, not wide anywhere, actually loses a
few feet of its width where it is most needed,
just off Bundle-street; Two or three years
ago the City Council had to look on while
those few feet were Sold at an enormous
figure for a picture-theatre; and its Parlia-
mentary and Bylaws Committee is out for
powers of compulsory acquisition in future.

“Lexite”: Wireless has not made much
hit yet in Australian cities, where the Fed-
eral Government discourages amateurs’ re-
search with license fees, but it is forging
ahead. In a Melbourne suburb the other
night an urgent call came to the local police
station for the despatch of a few cwt. of
bluecoated authority to a boarding-house
where a refractory citizen whs making trouble
with a revolver. The station hadn’t any
spare authority, but it sfent out a wireless
message which was. picked up by a patrol
equipped with receiving sets. And in a few
minutes that patrol was on the spot where
it was most wanted.

Police disbanded in Bulawayo after the Matabele
rebellion. We headed southwards, and, after a long
and thirsty trek, struck a railway-construction camp
in the vicinity of Palapye. While we were sitting
in the white men’s marquee- drinking whjsky (served
in cups and saucers and poured out of teapots in
deference to the royal wowser, who would not allow
intoxicating liquor into his country), the construc-
tion boss stormed in and announced that King
Khama was in the neighborhood and .would like to
shake hands with the heroes. A few of the fairly
sober ones accepted the invitation, and were ushered
into the Presence by the boss and introduced as
“all teetotalersh.” After the old man had shaken
hands all round, one of the troopers, in the fulness
of his heart, offered his Majesty a fin of sardines,

but was immediately checked by another on the
ground that the eating of fish was forbidden to the
Bechuanas. Then the construction boss chipped in.
“Him not eat fish!” he said, “Why, he’ll eat
anything that swims, runs, flies or crawls. He’s a

AT BALLYMACARRETT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In Belfast, under the influence of a religious
revival, bad debts are vanishing, swearing has almost
ceased in the dockyards, lucrative but questionable
callings are being abandoned, footballers are sharing
in the moral uplift, and the rector of Ballymacarrett
is training reformed gunmen to become Sunday-
school teachers.” — Cable.
I would I might hasten me hence
To where the Millennium begins,
Where with unction immense the transgressor
repents
And the sinner atones for his sins.
They’ve sworn off the booze in the bins
Of Belfast, be it whisky or claret,
And gunmen repair to devotion and prayer
With the rector of Ballymacarrett.
The layer on sporting .events
Rings off and to sanctity wins;
The footballer’s sense (uplifted) relents
Till nobody’s hacked on the shins;
The stream of profanity thins
Till you don’t hear a curse from a parrot,
And gunmen to grace are conducted apace
By tlie rector of Ballymacarrett.
The movies are over the fence,
Deserted the bars of the inns;
There’s reluctance intense to be debtor for cents,
Much less for half-casers or fins;:
Mankind grow fraternal -as twins
Be their habitat castle or garret,
While gunmen repeat beatitudes sweet,
And collects to boot, as they sit at the foot
Of the rector of Ballymacarrett.

“Norbell”: I have before me the toast-
list of a dinner given at a Melbourne hotel
on Friday, October 29, 188(1—nearly 87 years
ago. Amongst the musical items are “Song
—‘Sailing,’ ” and “Song—‘Then You’ll Re-
member Me.’ ” Both contributions to the
harmony of the occasion were by “Mr. .T.
M. Hickson.” At that time “Jim” Hickson
was a clerk in the Savings Bank, a dapper
youth who made a point of adorning the
Collins-street block every afternoon between
four and five Adonised in the glad'rags of
the knut. of the period, and sometimes sus-
taining a shiny belltopper with much dig-
nity. There was nothing of the hierophant
about Hickson in those far-off days. He
was a sociable chap, and popular in his set.
Also he was a front-row footballer.
New Speaker Watt has come little in con-
flict with the chair; but once a Premier
was invited to move his suspension. It was
in the Vic. Assembly, when lie was a free-
lance in the Ministerial corner. Bob Solly
was stonewalling a bill which his (the
Labor) party favored, and Watt interjected,
“What’s the game?” Solly took offeuce.
and Craven, Chair-
man of Commit-
tees, demanded a
withdrawal. Watt,
after a few sec-
onds’ reflection, de-
clined to wit h-
draw, and Premier
Bent, when he was
invited to submit
a suspension mo-
tion, flatly refused
to do it. There-
upon Watt took
compassion on the
cha i r, withdrew
the remark, and
an awkward corner
was turned.

“Xox” : All the Federal Speakers to date

of the position. One is Charlie McDonald,
once in the forefront of every Opposition
attack, now so broken by neurasthenia that
he will probably remain a silent member for
the rest of his existence. Nor will much be
heard from Elliot Johnson, an eminently fair
and dignified gentleman. Johnson had a hint
of his fate when he returned to Melbourne
hurriedly before the House met, and the
sudden arrival of Marr, who called on him at
the House at 10.30 on the Sunday night, re-
maining until close on midnight, was suffi-
ciently uncommon to suggest that Johnson
had received his death warrant and could
prepare himself for burial. Watt, now elected,
and presumably suffering from bad health,
has now time to consider unhappy precedents
—and how to avoid them. Salmon and
Holder died with tragic suddenness, and no
doubt the effort to maintain an impartial
sway over the contending factions shortened
their lives a good deal, though Holder, who,
like Johnson, lived at the House, but in much
less state than the late occupant of the wig,
avoided all outside excitement by a monastic
seclusion, and kept his delicate stomach work-
ing with a poorhouse simplicity in the matter
of food.
Joseph Angus Thomson, the Perth citizen
who was charged with abducting his eight-
year-old grandson from paternal custody at
Sydney the other day, and practically
acquitted with honors on the ground that he
had acted in the youngster’s best interests,
was a well-known W.A. politician when the
century was young. He fought half-a-dozen
elections with more pluck than luck against
the old Forrest regime, and just missed be-
coming a Federal Senator at the first Com-
monwealth elections, running seventh in a
field of 16. A couple of years later, w r hen
Norman Ewing (now a Tasmanian Judge)
. resigned liis Senatorship, the State Parlia-
ment offered the vacancy to Thomson, but the
latter had meantime obtained a seat in the
State Leg. Council, and elected to stick to
it. His Parliamentary experience began and
ended with that six years in Groperland’s
Upper House.
William Herries, for many years Bill Mas-
sey’s Minister for M.L. Railways, pulled out
on the last train from Wellington the other
night without a return ticket. An Eton
and Cambridge man, he took his post-
graduate course on a bush farm near Te
Aroha, and drifted into the House of Reps,
about 1896; thence he sat continuously. A
tall, thin, red-faced man in his early Parlia-
mentary days, of rough exterior and polished
hearing, his hobby was to lounge into the
House while Dick Seddon was trumpeting
the daily defiance at his enemies (who gen-
erally numbered three all told), listen in the
politest possible mannah for five minutes,
and then, after decorating himself with an
outsize grin, lounge away for refreshment
and a yarn. And a really good yarner
Herries w r as, too —tolerant, well-informed
and witty. Time turned the once red,
mobile face scarlet and stodgy; the lithe,
erect figure grew flabbily stout. But those
were signs of his virtues—and they were
many, for Herries was a man’s man of the
best sort. He was a geologist of consider-
able attainment, a friend to the turf, a lover
of peace and quiet, a member of the London
Athenaeum, and a generous, kindly soul. The
signal went up at 67.
“F.J.” : Of the 45 representatives -of the
six Australian colonies and of M.L. at the
Federation Convention in Sydney, presided
over by Parkes, 32 years ago this month,
there are six survivors: W. McMillan
(N.S.W.), A. J. Thynne (Q.), Dr. Cock-
burn and Justice Gordon (S. Aus.), Staf-
ford Bird (Speck) and W. T. Loton (W.A.).
Bird and Loton are over 80, Thynne is in
his 76th year, and the other three were born
in 1850. ' Not one of the Victorian seven at
the Convention is left. Robt. Best. Vic.
Min. of Lands in 1896, is the only survivor
of those who attended the three Premiers’
Conferences held to discuss Federation in
’95, ’96 and ’97, preceding the National Con-
vention at Adelaide.
“Inanga” on a man who came back :
If Joe Ward, Bart., should succeed in getting back
to the M.L. Parliament he will have twice justified
the claim of “R.L.S.” that there is a “true romance
of history.” From telegraph-operator down in
■cold Southland, Ward became a produce dealer,
gambled to win £30,000 on wheat, and lost; then
promoted companies, and after a starry career in
Parliament came to grief financially. The Judge
who sat on the case also sat very heavily on Ward,
and there followed a wintry period for the bustling
young man, brightened by the graciousness of Sed-
don—who, as a fact, couldn’t do without the only
man who knew the only side of administration that
Seddon didn’t know, finance. Meantime, Ward had
many friends, and presently emerged financially
strong ; paid off his old creditors who had clamored
for his head on a charge sheet; re-entered Parlia-
ment, and took office with the everlasting Seddon ;
became Prime Minister, joined the hereditary nobil-
ity; and knighted the Judge who had scarified him.
lie lost his political number in a general revolt
against Seddonism and cocked-hat Imperialism a few
years ago. But, as history records, Josephs have a
trick of coming back.
With the knowledge of having built up a
big industry, James Peter Franki is retiring
from. his. job as manager of Mort’s Dock,
Sydney, after 56 years with the co. When
he joined up as an engineering draughtsman
in January, 1867, he was one of less than
100 employees. Two years later he was
offered the billet of manager, and after that
the history of the Dock was largely what the
little human dynamo made it.
Passed out at Hawthorn (Vic.) the other
day, John Leonard Forde, journalist of
three Australian capitals, in his 79th year.
He was a friend of J. F. Archibald in the
days before The Bulletin, and was one of
the oldest contributors to the paper.
Frank Anstey, who fired the first broadside
at the BruceT’ages in the Reps, last week,
did not acquire his vitriolic and satirical
habits yesterday. They were well-developed
when he was in the Vie. Assembly. Eighteen
years ago Premier Bent moved that the
House place on record its appreciation of
the services of Irvine as Premier, Minister
and member. Anstey submitted an amend-
ment that the Iceberg be presented, instead,
with a framed copy ~of the Railway Strike
Suppression Bill of 1903, “with an earnest
expression of the hope that it may do him
good.” Of course the amendment was thrown
out, but it served as a peg for a speech. And
when Anstey has made a speech his job is
done.
Dr. Elkington, formerly head of quaran-
tine matters Queensland and the N. Ter-
ritory, now takes over administrative con-
trol of the Australian Institute of Tropical
Medicine at Townsville (Q.), the Depart-
ment’s laboratory at Rabaul (New Guinea),
and the new health laboratories in Queens-
land. Nobody in sight has better qualifi-
cations for the big job. A product of Mel-
bourne Uni. —his father was Prof. Elking-
ton—he specialised from the first in public
health and tropical medicine, and spent
some years in India continuing his studies.
Then he returned to Australia, became chief
medical-officer of Tasmania, shook up the
little island as it had never been shaken in
that way before, arid finally passed to the
Federal Health Department when that was
organised. Incidentally, The Bulletin
has always had a grievance against -Elking-
ton V profession—it robbed this paper and
Australia of one of their most promising
writers.
Charles Gabb, who turned up in Australia
at the age of two, settled in 1853 at Can-
terbury (Sydney), then practically all bush,
and lived there till he died the'other day.
He was a member of the Canterbury Road
Trust, formed in 1875, which put up a toll-
bar for re-
venue p u r-
poses, and he
made the first
valuation of
land in the
district —■ in
1879. The
ancient he

years short of
the century—
left 126 de-
scendants.
E. F.
BLYTHE,
Minister
of Lands
in Tas-
mania.
T. S. B. Woodfull, the new Vic. presi-
dent of the Method! es, was one of the stal-
warts who helped to Wreck the Collingwood
‘‘tote,” and he had a hand in the legislation
against sweating. He was a chemist before
he started, out on the tracks of John Wesley.
Turned up, as usual at the Methodist
annual conference in Sydney last week, John
Gale, the veteran inky wayfarer. He is now
02, and has been a member of the N.S.W.
conference since its start, 68 years ago.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: So Robert
Hammond Elvy has gone west before me, at
1)3. I had known him for 65 years, our
acquaintance commencing in the old Arcade
which ran from Lonsdale to Little Bourke
street, Melbourne, between Elizabeth and
Swanston streets. In the mid-’fifties Joseph
Wilkie, a pioneer music merchant, had a
shop there which was in Elvy’s charge.
(Wilkie represented Polwarth and Gren-
ville in the second Leg. Assembly.) The
Arcade was not a financial success, and the
shopkeepers migrated, the Wilkie business
being transferred to the north side of Col-
lins-street, immediately opposite the old Mel-
bourne Club. Elvy came to Sydney in, I
think, 1861 with his wife (nee Hardy), and
started the business with which his name
has been so long connected —about 60 years.
Later the Melbourne business became Wilkie
and Webster, and then Allan, a teacher
of singing, joined. It is now, I believe,
Allan and Co. The original Allan had classes
in the early ’sixties in St. Paul’s school-
room, on the site now covered by the Cathe-
dral. He married a daughter of Clark,
tanner, saddler and leather merchant, of
Elizabeth-stfeet, who, with his wife and son,
went down with the London in 1866.
Frank Anstey, who had the job of propos-
ing Labor’s no-confidence motion when the
House of Reps, met, has the richest vein

When, however, he got to Ireland Lord
Decies, the Chief Censor there, broke down
Anstey’s opposition, and got him on his
feet. Anstey made the most impish speech
of his life. Every minute or so he rushed
like a whirlwind towards something that
looked like sedition, and cold water ran
down the Chief Censor’s back. But just as
it seemed inevitable that the speaker was
going to be guilty of the dreadful indis-
cretion, he smilingly wheeled round, and
went; off on another tack. It was all so
wonderfully clever that thereafter, when
there was speaking to be done in Ireland,
Decies begged Anstey to get to it.
Gone out at Hastings (M.L.), Col. Forster
Yelverton Goring, of the M.L. Artillery.
This Maori War veteran, who was born in
Ireland 77 years ago, gained a commission
rn the Ist Waikato Militia, and between
1863 and ’6B saw much service under Gen-
erals Chute and Cameron at Tauranga and
in the sultry Urewera region. After the
war he bossed the gunners at Auckland and
Dunedin.
When Alec Peacock was Vic. Minister
for Education in September, 1894, he pen-
sioned off Thomas Brodribb, the then per-
manent head, who had served 29 years.
Brodribb drew 'his £4lO a year for 29 years
and died the 'other day at Ivew, aged
87. He helped Yardstick Sargood to start
the school military-cadet movement, and re-
tired with the rank of Lt.-Col. His last
public appearance was on the platform at
the free, secular and compulsory education
jubilee celebration in Melbourne', last year.
Peacock, by the way, is still Minister for
Education, but he hasn’t been there for the
whole 29 years. Fie has let others have a
turn now and then.
Watt is the fifth Speaker the House of
Iteps. has known; two of his predecessors
are dead and the other two are still in the
House. Fred Holder came first (eight
years two months) ; he died in har-
ness. ihe late Carty Salmon, Holder’s
successor, enjoyed a bare twelvemonth of
wig and mace. Since then Charles McDonald
and Elliot Johnson have had two terms
apiece, the former aggregating 54 years, the
latter 64. Watt is the second Victorian to
hold the job. South Aus., Queensland and
the Ma State have supplied a Speaker apiece.
Groperland and the Speck are so far non-
producers.
Old Galleryite”: Several times some-
oody had to get out of the way when
\Villie Watt wanted something. ITender-
gast, the perpetual Vie. Opposition leader,
was pushed aside when Watt nominated for
North Melbourne in 1897. Allan McLean
had to turn his back on two or three of the
valiants who helped him to displace George
Turner, so that Willie Could be made P.M.G.
jjaek Murray felt himself forced to hand
over the Premiership to Watt, his second in
command; and Carty Salmon, who almost
had Balaclava in his pocket, was elbowed
backward when William made up his mind
to go into Federal politics. Jocook fooled
away his time in London, ignored by
Hughes, although he was No. 2 in the
Cabinet, while Watt was Acting Prime
Minister. And now we have Elliot John-
son surrendering the wig, gown and chair
because Watt “consented” to rule the roost
in the Reps.
COMPARATIVE VALUES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Petitions have been prepared on behalf of the
prisoners condemned to death for the murder of
——. There is already an enormous rush to sign.’’
Five years ago the war was old,
The war that set the world ablaze;
While human sympathies, grown cold,
Deplored the loss of brave and bold,
We gave more thought to novel ways
Of raising cash on button days.
When reading of that daily heap
Of soldiers none would see again,
We realised that life was cheap,
And Death, the Reaper, hoped to reap
A record crop from that campaign—
A crop of worthy fellows slain.
The luckless millions slaughtered by
Hun war-lords in the recent years,
We mourn their loss with scarce a sigh;
Since truly dead the dead men lie, .
Beyond the reach of hopes or fears;
For one alive we shed our tears.
“Oh, hang him not, this felon mean,
Who killed a man with gun or knife;
Remember that he might have been
Sore tempted to his act unclean
By fondness for the victim’s wife!”
The value of a human life
Petition-mongers thus proclaim,
When war desists from taking toll.
’Tis then we find some rotter’s name '
Committed to enduring fame
Upon the prison’s scarlet roll,
The mark of Cain upon his soul.
And, therefore, spectres haunt our sleep;
With taunting question they appear-
If good men’s lives were once so cheap,
Say, why are bad men’s now so dear ?

ABORIGINALITIES

"Koala-lover”: A while back someone
wrote of the difficulty of keeping native bears
any length of time in captivity. On the Proser-
pine River (N.Q.), in ’l4, I took from its mother
a thvee-months-old female cub, which for the first
few months slept upon its mother’s cured skin.
She has since travelled with me round to Gerald-
ton (W.A.), back again to Sydney and returned
finally to Westralia, always being well cared for.
much petted, and fed only on blue and other gum
leaves, with about half-a-pint of milk daily to
drink. She has a large cage covering some dead
trees in which she rests contentedly when not
about the house, and to-day 'is in excellent con-
dition. Thus you’ll see that when properly fed
and cared for these beautiful little creatures will
live a long while. I have now had this one for
-SI years and it looks as though she has several
more happy years yet to live. One peculiarity v
that when loose in the garden she at times read-
ily licks up gravel or earth, apparently for diges-
tive purposes ; and each morning she eats about
.five small peppermint lollies.
‘Pee Gee”: Coming home to camp the
other evening we were horrified to see our cook surfing
in a small tank which was our only water supply.
Advancing, intent on murder, we were enlightened
with “S’orite, boys, I ain’t using soap.”
A MEDICAL OFFSIDER.
PATIENT: “I want yer to examine me for occupational
diseases, doctor.”
DOCTOR: “ What occupation do you follow?”
PATIENT: “Well, I really follers the medical
perfeshun. I ’edps to dig the graves.”
‘Jimmy Possum”: The old ’roo shooter
was pulling “J.A.S.’s” leg when he told that yarn
about shooting a mammy kangaroo with a baby
djngo tucked away in her pouch (B. 28/12/’22).
Mrs. ’Roo knows better than to go near a dingo’s
lair. Anyhow, it is doubtful whether a dingo cub
would savvy the lady’s mothering convenience, the
teat being very long, thin, and flexible when she
is nursing. It is certain, though, that no respec-
table mammy ’roo would tolerate a sucking puppy
tearing at the lining of her cradle with his sharp
claws. I tried to suckle a young puppy on a
nannygoat once, but as soon as the young howler
started marking time with his toe-nails nanny gave
one terrified baa-a and a kick, and puppy’s adop-
tion ended.
* * * *
“A. Jocelyn”: In N.-B. Vic. the spread
of St. John’s wort has become terrifying during the
past few years—and I’d be game to bet that half
our politicians have never heard of the weed.
Originally imported by an old German lady in Bright.
it rapidly became acclima-
tised, and soon spread
throughout the district. Now
thousands upon thousands of
acres in the Nor’-East have
been rendered worthless by
the encroaching weed ; and it
is also making its way down
the rivers into Gippsland.
This pestiferous thing lias
such powerful effects upon
stock that one wonders if ’t
hasn’t some scientific value.
Sheep soon die from the
effects of grazing on it, and
cattle break out in festering
sores, and gradually pine
away. I can never forget
having, as a lad, assisted with
a mob of cattle through wort
country. They grazed on fhe
weed as they travelled, and
the drover, as ignorant on the
matter as I was then myself,
allowed them to water at a
small creek. The effect of
drinking after eating the pest
was electric. The mob turned
completely mad, and could not
be handled for some hours. A
third of them died. And this
appalling invasion continues,
amid an exasperating silence from the high-
salaried ones.

“Archbell”: “F. Clinton’s” Digger friends
(B. 4/l/’23) need not lose a swarm of bees simply
because the queen has been mislaid. Let
them put the bees into a box 'or ■ hive : and
then look carefully through some of the-
combs. They will find brood in various stages,
from eggs to hatching, and if they carefully take out
a piece of comb containing grubs—say the size of
a grain of rice—and attach it to one of the frames
in the “queenless” colony, the bees will rear a new
queen, and she will be laying in about 14 days from
the time the bees get the grubs (o raise her from.
‘“Dunederra”: Is this an entry for the
Queer Accident Stakes or a sample of insect suicide
(would you call that insecticide?). Riding along
a barbed-wire fence the other day 1 found, speared
i i.ght through the head on one of the barbs, a tine
big grasshopper. The Council can /decide whether
he took a bad aim or was just tired of being
chased by birds.
* * * *
“Tarago”: Melbourne Age recently re-
corded that a boy bitten by a snake
collapsed within a few minutes, rl-
though two ligatures were immedi-
ately applied to- the limb. Some
time ago I put my No. 7 on an
outsize in tiger-snakes. He hit
me a lightning-like stroke on the
calf of the leg with the bad: of
his head —I saw him do it, so knew
I was not bitten. I killed the
wriggler, and -within a few,, minutes
paralysis seized my legs—particularly
the one struck—and I collapsed on a
log. This ' was followed by a semi-
blindncss and a violent nausea, and
it was only by repeated efforts and
force of will that I staggered home in
short stages. I was dopey for a
couple of days after. Had I not 'seen
exactly what happened all this would
have been put down to snake ven-
om. Later, a doctor told me that I had
had all the symptoms of a bad snake-
bite, but a subsequent experience of
a real bite proved him wrong. That
time I had a dry sensation in the
throat, a wihdy feeling in the stom-
ach, and a burning, tingling pain
hke that after contact with stinging net-
tle ; but more intense, in the region
where there were two small punc-
tures in a slight swelling with red,
angry streaks reaching out like ten-
drils in all directions. I am in-
clined to think that the recognised
symptoms of snake-bite are caused
by shock, and it is quite possible
for a person who has not been bit-
ten to get a greater shock than when
a bite does really occur; but if the
victim is badly ' shocked and bitten
at the same time, his chances of re-
covery are small.
Copy of a letter received by a citizen who
advertised for “Antbed, price per yard,” in one of
the dailies:—
Dear Sir, —I saw in this morning’s paper where vou
are advertising for an ant-bed. I can’t imagine why
you should want one, but if it is that you want to
experiment with some ant-exterminator, I can tell
you where there is one. Of course it is not mine
to sell, but it would be beneficial to the general public
if it were destroyed. It is situated in the pathway
opposite graves in the old portion of the
Methodist Cemetery, Rookwood. The sexton is look-
ing out for something which will exterminate the
ants. I cannot stay by my husband’s grave for one
minute because of them. —I am, yours etc.

“Betterave”: Another instance of the
snake’s fondness for little children. About 15
years ago, near Laidley (Q.), a woman was
awakened one night by the crying of her youngest
child, a tot of two. Investigation showed that the
baby was on the floor, having been pulled out of
IN THE SAME BOAT.
FARE: “Say, driver, not so fast —this is my first trip in a taxi.”
DRIVER: “Mine, too.”
bed by a carpet-snake between 7ft. and Bft. long, which
had shown its fondness to the extent of engorging
the left hand and part of the forearm of the infant.
An axe brought the snake’s display of affection to an
end, but in its flurry it first disgorged the hand and then
struck the youngster’s right arm twice. The kiddy was
very ill after the bites, which were not medically
treated, and it was not until his fifth year that the
effects were overcome. Why the wriggler started
with the hand I can’t guess, unless it had found
the baby’s head (the end always taken first) too large.
Both mother and child still live hard by the scene
of the occurrence.
“Delhi”: I can’t tell “Ned Kelly” (B.
8/2/’23) why other fowl take notice of the soldier-
bird’s alarm ; but I’ve never yet come across a
bush-bird that would disregard the warning of a
thrush. Many a time I have • “stalked” a pigeon,
careful never to make a sound, and just as I
have raised the gun there has come one shrill note
from a thrush and the game has vanished. I have
often seen scrub-wallabies skeddadle at the quick
warning of the thrush.
* * * *.
“Caff” : Herewith a royal routine for the
Accident Welter. Dad started out with the kid.
also a spring dray and a young horse, to repair
an old well. He hadn’t gone far before the kid
fell out of the back. Dad; turned round to investi-
gate and the horse took fright, eventually throwing
Dad out and breaking its own leg. When Dad had
recovered, taken the kid home an<D'put the horse
out of its misery he again set forth fo! the well, and
while he was removing the overhead gear the rotten
boards underneath gave way, dropping him to the
bottom. Workmen near by, hearing his calls, rushed
across and lowered the oil-drum. They had not
raised the old chap more than 6ft. before the
ancient rope broke. Eventually Dad was landed,
and as he lay battered on the grass I asked him
how he felt. He replied, - well !” I still wonder
which he meant.
“W.D.G.”: Re “P.M.S.” (B. 25/l/’23) on
animals as weather * prophets. I have repeatedly
noticed sheep, in the habit of coming in early in the
morning to water at wells in the hot weather, stay
out all day ; and when this happened it almost invari-
ably rained the following night. Once the jumbucks
stayed away till midnight, but no rain fell that time.
If horses and cattle that water a,t wells and dams also
keep out in the paddocks hours after their usual
watering time, rain nearly always comes along.
“Haliastic”: A while ago someone was
holding forth about dogs not inheriting the qualities
of the breed to which they belong.. Well, I recently
bought a sheep-pup which had spent all its life in a
town. The day before I got it the owner tried it,
alone, with some sheep, and it rounded them up as if
it had done it all its life. I also have a pointer
which had never seen a quail, let alone another dog
at work, until I took him out, and the very first
time he smelt a quail he stood stiff. A pointer or
setter will hunt about all day, but the average ch°ep-
dog will probably follow them out and, when he
sees what they are up to, come home and lie down—
at any rate mine does. On tie other hand, a gun
dog shows no interest in sheep;
* * * *
“Z mra”: We were standing at the bar
when Bill blew in and asked us to wet the baby’s
head. \Y e duly blew the froth off, and were con-
gratulating the happy parent when Kelly chipped in
teasingly: “Princess Mary beat yer by ’arf a ’ead.”
Bill put down his pot at a gulp. “Blime! So she
oughter,’’ he retorted. “They ’ad five months’ start
on us.” You can work it out for yourselves.
* * * *
“32x40”: Tell “Ack F. C.” (B. 8/2/’23)
that among the professional shooters in north-west
Queensland the cook has to shoot more than four ’roos
a day to. keep the camp in fttlw meat. Four skins
a day (market value; about 125.) would not return a
living wage—in fact, would only just about pay ex-
penses. The shooter who cannot do his 10 or 15 a day, in
decent ’roo country, should look for a job road-
making. My last effort among the hoppers was in
1918, on Warenda (Q.). In 28 weeks my mate and 1
delivered 3300 pelts to Gibney'and Co., Selwyn. Our
actual shooting time was 22 weeks. And you won't
.see our names written up on the gidya trees as big
guns.

“Jimmy Possum” : That wasn’t gum which
“Wild Oat” (B. 25/l/’23) found so difficult to re-
move when toiling around a sawmill —it was juice.
If he had been handling tallow-wood instead of
stringy-bark lie would have had more to growl abo. t.
AN EASY ONE.
THE LADY : "Now, I am a very strict vege-
tarian, so, if I give you a shilling, will
you promise not spend it on meat?”
BEERY BOB (enthusiastically) : “My oath,
ma’am!”
When working this timber—which, by the way, is
closely allied to yellow-stringy—the hands become
hard and almost black from the oily sap which con-
tinually runs from it, and after the first week one’s
pants will stand alone after being washed. The
stain is so enduring that repeated boiling will not
remove it from clothing affected by it. As “Wild
Oat’’ says, the only cure is to let the dam’ thing
wear itself out.

MY BLOODWOODS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
An age ago adown a lonely way
1 lode from home and all that it held dear.
My youth, my hopes, my sin behind me lay;
Before—the whole wide world, all dread and drear.
No loved hand fluttered fond farewell to me;
No brave “God-speed” came ringing cheerfully;
But on the ridge against the dark’ning sky
The stalwart bloodwoods waved their sad good-bye.
Long years I’ve ridden many a toilsome road,
The far, faint tracks that only rovers know;
Have borne an exile’s weary, bitter load,
And found the march of Time exceeding slow.
An outcast I who have no kin or friend
To give me hail when all my wanderings end ;
But this I know, that, standing steadfastly,
The watching bloodwoods wait to welcome me.
Grey years stretch out in grim and fearful line
Ahead, wherein to glean the grief I’ve sown,
But, from the Weaver of the Great Design
Upon Whose shuttle I am hither thrown,
A meagre measure I of kindness crave,
That some brown hand may scoop my shallow
grave,
And lay me where, through all eternity,
My bloodwoods may moan requiem over me.
QUEENSLAND.

“W.R.”: I have struck the champion
curio billycan. It has been used for a couple of
years boiling hard water, and has now about three-
quarters of an inch of scale completely lining it.
The outside is pretty well destroyed, but the lining
holds the water. The owner is a prospector, and
complains of dust on the chest from mining. His
billy makes me wonder if drinking the water prior
to boiling is not responsible for his trouble,
“Bill R.”; Among Australian wild birds
only the lyre, as a rule, imitates the oft-heard
sounds of settled localities, and even he gets more
credit for mimicry than his achievements entitle
him to. But in the village of Bungendore
(.N.S.W.) a magpie, hatched and grubbed in the
pines of the recreation park, has adopted almost
entirely the customary sounds of the town in pre-
ference to the carol notes of his clan. His imita :
tion of an engine whistle frequently deceives the
railway-men, and has often caused the freezing-works
hands to get a move on before shift-time. He
crows lustily with the town roosters, and his mimi-
cry of a lorry’s wheels crunching on metal is a
masterpiece. Also on moonlight nights, when there
is a vociferous yapping out in front, the drowsy
resident doesn’t know whether he has to strafe . a
mustering of poodles on his lawn, or pelt a pie-
mag from the picket-fence.
“Cab”: Re “Wanderer” (B. 18/l/’23) ori
laughing-jackasses carrying off small birds. Although
I have never seen a bird of the air being taken, I’ve
lost a couple of young ducks through a predacious
John. The marauder was often about the fowl-
yard, and one morning I saw him rise in the air
with one of the small. quackers. He repeated the
performance next morning. The third day he
seemed to know that a charge of shot was waiting
for him, and he didn’t call.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum” : “S.S.” (B. 28/12/’22)
certainly knows something about snakes when he
says they have a partiality for kiddies, particularly
the wee ones. A while back I had a three-year-
old nephew living with me who was always break-
ing-in the cat or the dog. One evening he appeared
to be enjoying himself more than usual, and I
paused in my work to listen. “Gee up, yer bally
cow,” he was saying, “gee up. Whoa. Come here.
Gee back,” etc. Then he commenced to cry with
childish exasperation. “I don’t want you t<? go
that way, you ole thing,” he squealed, “go this
way.” I went out to enjoy the sport. The nip-
per had a 9ft. carpet snake by the tail and was
trying to steer it along the footpath towards the
house. The driver had lost his block when the
wriggler wanted to take a short* cut across the
flower beds. P.S.: This is a flamin’ lie; but it
could have easily happened.—J.P.
* * * *
“J.F.N.”: A Bulletin par. (15/2/’23)
asks why there are no quaint family names in Aus-
tralia, as in Britain, and looks forward to a time
when there will be “widespread families of Sheep-
dip, Mulgawire and Heatwave.” On a mill camp in
Victoria last year I worked with one known locally,
at any rate, as Harry Heatwave. He was first
cousin in appearance and behavior to Lawson’s
“Previous Convictions.”
“N. or M.”: Re “Simon II.” on canni-
balism among the abes. (B. 1 / 2/ : 23). An old
gentleman, now between his 80th and 90th mile-
stones, tells me that when the tribe he was
acquainted with in early Victoria came back from its
yearly migrations it was invariably noticed that
the half-caste piccaninnies had disappeared. There
was no direct evidence of cannibalism, but the infer-
ence was strong. Tribal instinct impelled the natives
to sacrifice their half-breeds first. Apropos the sorry
lot of - the half-caste. An old sea-captain who used
to make Hobart a frequent port of call saved a
little blaekgirl from a tragic fate and then adopted
her. The scorn of this small nigger for the “Portu
gee” cabin-boy was superb. “What you think you
are?” she would sneer. “Cap’n good white fella;
me good black fella —what you ? Nothing! Color
belong soap!”
* * * *
“Molokilii”: My Papuan cook-boy had
often asked me for quinine or salts for his simple
complaints, but I was rather puzzled when he came
on sick parade with the remark, “My belly he sore;
more better you give me some rubbetin.” It was
not until he produced an empty bottle smelling of
embrdention that it dawned on me what he wanted.
As usual, he had covered the affected part with small
scratches, presumably to let out the evil spirit to
which the native assigns all his bodily ills.
“Tough Mike” : I don’t know what the
result would be if one were to shoot a prad under
the tuft of hair on the forehead as recommended
by “Yarrum” (B. 8/2/’23). In the instance he
quoted, the Digger’s shot may have been only a
case of the last straw- —death may have been, and
probably was, due to the cumulative effect of the
15 shots. But I know for certain that one: shot
in the neck about an inch behind the ear will
mean a job for the undertaker.
# * * #
“Dave Shep” : Tell “Jimmy Possum” (B.
25/l/’23) that ploughing and harrowing will get rid
of couch, provided the operations are carried out at
the right time and with the right implements. But
who told “Jimmy” that Bed Natal or Rhodes grass
would smother couch ? Why, Rhodes is a weakling
compared with couch, and Red Natal should be de-
clared a noxious weed by every cockie who has any
respect for his land or herds. If it gets over our
light and heavy volcanic soils in N. Queensland it
will break all records in depreciating unimproved
values. But as a real dinkum remedy to out couch
let me right here nominate kikuyu (Pennisetvm
eland esttnum) —a recent importation from South
AT THE FREE DISPENSARY.
CHEMIST: “You must take this medicine
three times a day after meals.”
DUKE OF HYDE PARK : “ Where'll I go for the
meals?”
Africa or thereabouts. This is the champion eradi-
cator so far, and, in addition, it is a great producer
of butter-fat and beef. Once it gets a toe-holt and
guaranteed 35 inches a year, it will give couch the
k.o. in double-quick time.
* * * *
“Sarah Anne”: “Gazeeka’s” kangaroos
and wallabies that clasp their front paws when
travelling fast (B. 11/l/’23) are something out of
the box. I have watched hundreds on the move, and
have never seen one do this prayerful act. They
always held their paws close down along their ribs.
THE MIRACLE OF BOURKE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Salamander car was red, with yellow streaks,
and snorted Are;
Jones bought it cheap and Mrs. Jones thus realised
her heart’s desire.
No other car for size and sound and color could
with this compete ;
Imperial was the only word that could describe it in
the street.
Its eight fierce cylinders could shake the dust of
noon’s serene repose
With such commotion that the hand of half a
nation gripped its nose.
But Jones was very sad indeed before a single
month had sped ;
His wife’s ambition, like a rose too early wilted,
dropped its head.
The mighty Salamander roared, its smell was large
and full and free,
Its lamps were like great searchlights trained upon
an unexpectant sea;
And charged with petrol to the brim it always let
the public know
Its nearness, but poor Jones was sad beoause its
pace had proved too slow.
Wild men in overalls and oil looked gravely at
its black inside,
And with hard spanners scratched their heads or
crawled beneath its scarlet pride,
And screwed up nuts and twisted screws and
swore with technical delight
That, though the whole affair was wrong, in theory
it seemed all right,
That though eight cylinders were there but one
would condescend to work —•
They recommended as a cure a trip from Sydney
back to Bourke.
A short spin on the country roads, they said, was
good for lazy cars.
Best get them used to passing sheep and running
under spotted stars;
Best let them taste the gentle dust and see the
mulga of the plain;
The sluggish liver of a car could thus be shaken
sound again.
So Jones went slowly to the west like some great
conqueror void of power;
The Salamander roared like doom and averaged six
miles an hour.
Day on slow day he chased the sun with fragrance
towards the shining west
Till ere a fortnight passed away out of the broad
plain’s ample breast
He saw the domes and turrets rise, the spires that
pierced the evening light,
The palms, the pointed minarets, the monuments
of marble white.
And far and far he heard the voice of gathered
thousands on the air..
’Twas Bourke—the city of a dream! The noise
he heard was evening prayer.
The great sun loitered, loath to go. The jasper roofs
were touched with fire.
They leaped into a thousand gems—topaz, cornelian
and the higher
Clear lights of sapphire flamed above the soaring
spires of malachite,
While lamps of festival below proclaimed the com-
ing of the night.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC MOTORIST.
“And are you really so keen on studying
medicine?”
“Rather! You see, doctors are allowed to
exceed the speed-limit.”
And from broad gardens, rich with bloom, arose the
tender haunting tones
Of all stringed instruments that seemed to speak
the simple name of Jones.
France has its Paris; old Stamboul is full of magic
for the Turk.
All roads perchance may lead to Rome; but Jones
was glad one led to Bourke.
Bourke, where the green of old dead springs seemed
living in a charm of air,
Delicious, cool and sweet, that crept about each
purple palace stair,
Was waiting but six miles away when Fate out
of the sunset spoke;
The Salamander snorted, sneezed and something in
the clock-work broke.
Day bowed to night. The darkness thrust the
blade of twilight in its sheath.
The car stood still in dusty red and Jones was
toiling underneath.
He screwed a nut, he swore an oath —a technical
full oath of pain—-
Then he unscrewed a screw and screwed the same
screw sadly in again.
THE DVD.
CLAIRE (as he passes): “Is he interesting?”
MAE: "No; all he does is to sit on the sand and talk.”
Like other people under cars, his brow grew black,
his eye grew wild;
The Salamander’s abdomen with oil his bitter
hopes defiled.
He had no notion what was wrong and no idea of
what was right,
While over'him the sprinkled stars had mottled all
the wide blue night.
He tapped and tinkered with a wrench and hoped
some prod in ribs or tail
Would start the thing to life before the morning
in the east grew pale;
And so, of course, he did not see the gathering
of tremendous cloud
That filled the south till with a roar and leap of
flame the storm grew loud.
The lighted palaces of Bourke were full of mirth
and laughter free;
The dancing thousands little thought of Jones in
midnight agony.
Vnd when the storm grew mad without the music
fast and faster flew
Where by the flash of fountains green beauty and
youth went two and two.
l'he red wine shone in cups of gold, and beakers
of pale amethyst
bubbled and sparkled where the maids of Bourke
the pleasant vintage kissed.
I' or this is half Australia’s charm —while drought
lies heavy on the sea
Hie central cities always shine with lights of
splendid revelry.
BUt Jones, half drowned, sat in his car while all
the night grew wild with mud,
While lightning tore the sky and nipped the hope
of morning in the bud.
it might have been a lightning stroke, it might
have been a falling star,
Hut something with a sudden jerk had touched
and started up the car.
With one tremendous gasp and pull the whole
eight cylinders awoke.
The mud gripped hard to stand the strain, but
into sogging furrows broke.
Jones gripped the wheel, the headlights flared;
and, rolling in the heavy sea,
He brought the Salamander in and anchored her
beside the quay.
Then o’er the battlements of Bourke he saw a
flash of open sky;
The night was past, the morning broke and happy
Jones began to dry.
Nine days from stately hall to hall he passed
as an invited guest
And shared the hospitality of all the princes of
the west.
And when he turned his car for home it was a
sight for all to see
The Salamander paw the air while wildly snorting
to be free.
Oiled with the wind, he tore the miles to smallest
shreds across the plain
And up the hills he went like light and dropped
like darkness down again.
A scarlet streak, he fled for home, the whole eight
cylinders at work;
And men with spanners grinned to hear him tell
the miracle ; of Bourke.
Ah, well! The car is pensioned now. He drives an
aeroplane instead ;
But Sally sleeps in the back yard and wears hei
ancient coat of red.
His children love to crank her up or screw the
little nuts that lurk
in secret places only found by atmospheric powers
at Bourke.
But when beside the Darling’s banks the magic
evening fills with sound,
When colored lamps are in the street and golden
cups are handed round;
Or when on rather chilly nights the fire leaps
high with ten-pound notes,
Then Jones remembers in the sky, where under
tufted clouds he floats,
The night, the darkness and the rain, the sudden
music in his ears
Of Sally racing—and his eyes are blurred again
with happy tears.

what an important part hose plays in our industries.
In every direction Dunlop special hoses have to be made
for special purposes, each being different in construction,
thickness, strength, pliability, etc. We illustrate a variety of
DUNLOP
that are daily rendering economical service—doing their work
silently and satisfactorily at the minimum cost. In mining
centres air hose is used for drilling machines, working up to a
pressure of 20001b5., whilst the hose used on hydraulic machines
is built to withstand a pressure of 30001bs. Steam hose has to be
constructed to withstand the burning effect on the inner rubber
wall of hose. Delivery hose is used for conducting water, under
moderate pressure, on railways and steamships, for horticultural
purposes, &c., &c. In pumping plants, tanneries, breweries,
irrigation work, and for mining and dredging, suction hoses are
essential, and are constructed so that there is no contraction of
sides of hose during suction operations. In breweries and
wineries a variety of hoses are used for conducting beer,
wine, &c., and have to be constructed with specialinside rubber
walls to prevent damaging the taste of the liquor. Again, special
hoses are used for paint spraying, conducting oil, acid, and other
materials deleterious to rubber. The largest users of hose in this
country are the various Railway departments— the Westinghouse
brake air hose and vacuum air brake hose being essential to the
braking systems in operation on our railways, and upon which
the safety of the travelling public and railway transport depend.
Many of the above hoses have to be constructed with a covering of
flat or round wire, or woven cotton, to withstand abrasion in use.
All these hoses call for the highest quality of materials and
special construction, and in this direction “Dunlop” Hoses have
won a fine reputation for dependability and economical service.
Another important factor is that, being made in Australia
they are free from perish and can be made without delay
to suit the requirements of every branch of industry. We have
an Illustrated Booklet that fully covers these hoses, and shall
be pleased to mail a copy to users of industrial hoses.

Archie MaClaren’s English XI, wearing
the flush of ah unbeaten record in Maori-
land, came back to Sydney last week. The
tripping has made wonderful changes in most
of them. The English roses have all given
way to sunbrown, and it is difficult to pick
them out from the dinkum Aussie. Also
military—haw—ways have dropped over-
board, and when Captain Hartley led his
team out after the interval at the match on
the S.C.G. on Saturday he even carried iiis
crushed cap in his hand! No other English
captain has been known to do such a thing
in half-a-century of cricket.
St. Andrew’s, at Summer Hill, put out the
“full-house” sign at an early hour one night
last week, when Grace Chapman was booked
to say she would. Grace, the only daughter
of Percy Chapman, is an old Normanhurst
girl, and a great favorite in her native suburb,
and Harold Saxton, of the second part,
is one of the sons in the family timber firm.
The church decked itself in palms and white
favors, and there was a murmur as of ap-
plause when the fair-haired leading lady flut-
tered up the aisle, drawing the immemorial
bridal satins and laces in her wake. Four
bridesmaids, whose flame-colored frocking
was caught with huge silver roses at the
wajist and made demure by black panne velvet
hats, billowed after the souffle of Carrickma-
eross and tulle. When Canon Langford-
Smitli had bestowed the final blessing, and
Thea Haege had sung “Beloved, It is Morn,”
the invited, disentangling themselves from
the uninvited, went on for further sustenance
to the bride’s garden-bowered home.
Kathleen Bradhurst, of Ivirribilli, was
married at St. Philip’s midway through last
week. The Bradhursts hailed from Wagga,
and bridegroom Harry Baylis is a grandson
of a former P.M. of that hamlet. Kathleen
shimmered in white satin and silver lace, and
trailed a soft mist of Limerick lace that
started out as a blossom-encircled veil and
continued itself into a sweeping train. The
two bridesmaids introduced an autumn note
in the golden brown of the hats that finished
off apricot frocking. The feast was spread
at the Macquarie, where the bride’s mother
dispensed cordiality, etc., clothed in del-
phinium-blue from her millinery downwards.
Married during last week-end, Ethel Phip-
pard, of Sutherland-crescent, Darling Point.
Ethel, who is one of Sydney’s popular and
smartly-froeked lasses, chose to do the deed
in the stillness of old Windsor town, being mar-
ried from the Wormington household (she
was. the Laidley girl with the pretty smile).
Ethel’s new husband is John W. Greig, a
former A.1.F.-er, now repatriating himself
on the land. Ethel, by the way, is a young
lady of resource and enterprise. For two
years she ran a real-estate office in Vickery’s
Chambers.
Lorna, one of the three good-looking
orphans of the horse-training Tom Paytens,
of Randwick, and herself an enthusiastic
racegoer, has become engaged to Leo
Maloney, of Albury. The wedding is timed
for Easter, and after that the couple will
live at Randwick.
Another engagement that will interest the
North Side is that of Mr. T. Hume. He
is father of the gifted Mrs. Margaret Dale,
and his bride-to-be is a sister of sculptress
Dora Ohlfssen.
The supei’ior male looks upon women book-
keepers as mere trifiers at the business. Yet
a woman, Miss M. E. Wilcox, captured first
place for N.S.W. at some recent exams, of
the Commonwealth Institute of Accountancy,
and missed second place for all Australia by
only one mark. ,
An odd catastrophe has happened to the
Itawson Institute. Its broth has been spoiled
by too many cooks, and it requires to be
saved from its friends. With the best inten-
tions in the worjd Lady Davidson made an
appeal which resulted in £4500 being sub-
scribed for the place. The executive under-
stood that the appeal was being made for
the general welfare of the Institute (which
badly needs the money), whereas it was actu-
ally made for money to build new quar-
ters —a luxury which isn’t wmnted, and
would, anyhowg cost some £20,000. The
people who put up the £4500 were the In-
stitute’s regular subscribers (as always hap-
pens in such circumstances), and now they
are naturally reluctant to provide further
large sums, vet, without such sums, the In-
stitute won’t be able to carry on. It is essen-
tially one of those cases that call for a stern
Cromwellian gesture directed at the red-tape
habit.
A waterside hostess gave the Jules Miche-
let time to get under weigh before retailing
an incident of her card parties. A young
officer, with only a working knowledge of
English, was having a run of luck which re-
sulted, among other things, in his being
slapped on the back by the hostess’s son
and dubbed “Lucky dog!” “I do not like
being called ‘dog’, ” he indignantly exclaimed,
but was quite mollified when it was ex-
plained that the word, employed after such
an adjective, was purely a term of congratu-
lation. On the officer’s second visit, it was
the hostess’s daughter’s turn to win. Evi-
dently anxious to air his mastery of English
idioms, young France offered his felicitations
in the same phrase that had been applied to
him, merely feminising the noun. He
seemed, and possibly still is, quite unable
to account for the stunning silence that fol-
lowed.
The Alex. Hays had hardly deposited their
luggage at Burdekin House before they left
for Armidale on a visit to their daughter,
Hazel Jenkins. She was ill during most of
her wedding trip to England—the result of
a bad chill —and didn’t really recover till
she sighted Australia again. Mrs. Alex, is
only paying a flying visit to Australia. Her
elder boy, Berry, goes to Cambridge this
year, and her sister and the younger son
are awaiting her in London.
Ruth and Mattie Chisholm, the only two
unmarried of the 1 six daughters left by the
late Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Chisholm, have
given up their Wahroonga home and are off
to visit Japan and Burmah, where their
sister Jessie lives. A farewell tea was given
the popular girls at thfc Queen’s Club.
Back in Sydney a?nd camping under the
new family roof-tree at Darling Point, Mrs.
Deschamps and daughter Yvonne. Yvonne
has been for four years in Europe studying
languages and music, first in Rome at St.
Cecilia’s Conservatorium, and later at Brus-
sels. The attractive, large-eyed youngster,
who is still in her teens, concentrated on her
singing, although she still kept on her piano
and violin studies, and has a vision of help-
ing Australian Art if dad (he’s managing-
director of Hadfield’s, Ltd.) will consent.
Amy and May Macleod, of Mosman, were
in last week’s exodus from Australia.
The Moreton Bay is taking them to England,
and for 12 months or so they will help wear
out the roadways of the Old World. The
Loughborough lord and his lady and their
offspring (the kiddies, by the way, have been
most of the'Summer at Bowral), Mrs. Ernest
Watt (to be followed presently by himself)
and Mrs. Floyd (Neutral Bay) are others
booked for the’ other end in time to greet the
English summer.
Ailsa Graliame, who had to give up her
own name, Craig, for stage purposes because
Ellen Terry’s daugh-
ter had already a
lien on it, came
home last week and
immediately cele-
brated the event by
nearly blowing her-
self up with a bath-
he a ter. In the
bosom of her own
family at Barn-
cleuth-square, she is
trying to realise
that it is nearly
eight years since she
left Sydney. Dur-
ing that time the
clever acting-girl has
stepped from one en-
gagement to an-
other: in every
cast she has been in
she has met somebody who had played in
Australia with Wilson Barrett, or Ethel
Irving, or Oscar Asche, and all wanted to
go back again. She says Mrs. Pat Camp-
bell and Lord Dunsany are the two mist
colorful stage-personages she has met. Mrs.
Pat, though temperamental in excelsis , is
adored by everybody connected with any
play she is in, and half the time at rehear-
sal Dunsany forgets he is directing a play,
and has the' whole company, even to the call-
boy, airing views on poetry, philosophy and
politics. Clemence Dane is looked to to
bring a new note into English drama, and
play-acting circles are enormously interested
in the difference in her treatment of her
blank-verse drama, “Will Shakspeare,” and
the brilliant “Bill of Divorcement.” Ailsa
is an old Sydney Uni. girl, and was a mem-
ber of the S.U.D.S. in its sunniest days.
Busy rehearsing now for “If Winter Comes,”
she is declining all invitations until after
the opening night. After that —well, you
should see the mountain of cards waiting to
be answered. So far she has escaped two
things that seemed inevitable —a swelled head
and an engagement-ring.
Dorothy Coffee is chaperoning her aunt,
Miss Eva Coffee, across to America on the
next trip of the Ventura. There are strong
grounds for calling the track between Syd-
ney and ’Frisco the Coffee-pot of the Pacific
—there’s always one or other of the family
going or coming. This time a Foy girl helps
to form the party.
A. E. Newbury, the Victorian artist who
is showing his landscapes in Horderns’ Gal-
lery, was a fellow-
student of Leason’s.
He has been married
since his last exhibi-
tion in Sydney; his
wife, who is seeing
the sights of this
town, was Ruth
Trumble, a niece of
Hugh, the cricketer.
When the young
couple are at home
they live in the p c-
turesque village of
Eltham, outside Mel-
bourne, where the
only excitement
occurs when the
cows are driven
home in the even-
ing. Newbury has
in the show a por-
trait of his bride in a domesticated print
dress chequered like a draught-board, one
of the best bits of painting in the show.
Evelyn Scotney, whose stage frocking plus
her voice and stage manner made her the
darling of Melbourne audiences two or three
years ago, is back in Australia, and at
present is up in Bowral. She expects to
give a series of concerts before returning
to America. Her husband. Howard White,
who was equally popular, died during a ’flu
epidemic in New York.
The picturesque Iris de Cairos-Rego gave
one of her too-rare piano recitals at the Con-
servatorium last week. To a programme
that included Liszt, Bach, Mozart apd
Chopin she added brother Rex’s original
and melodious Sonata for Piano and Violin.
At the close of the new work, in which
Cyril Monk operated on his tuneful fiddle,
Rex got a big hand from the house. _ The
violinist also turned on a crystal jet of
Brahms and Sarasate, and congratulations
filled the air.
Talk about “where angels fear to tread” !
The Alliance Franqaise is producing “Blue-
beard’s Eighth Wife” in Easter week at the
Conservatorium. The play is by Savoir, and
the English version—by Wimperis—was one
of the successes of last London season, with
good-looking and graceful Madge Titheradge
in the principal role. That part will be played
by Mrs. Bertie Kelly. Belgian Consul Segaert
and his daughter Henriette will again be
leading members of the cast; but Alliance
audiences will miss the brilliant little Irwin
girl from the bill. Incidentally, in June
Sydney will see Irene Vanbrugh and Dion
Boucicault in the play, which —also inciden-
tally—has for its principal male character
a very rich man named John Brown.
The Feminist Club lured Prohibitionist
Hammond to a luncheon in Farmers’ lounge
the other day, when the gentleman advised
everybody not only to tow her own craft
into dry dock, but to help haul her neigh-
bor’s there also. He said all the usual
things about prohibition being the birth of
a nation, if not its christening, and the
lunchers swallowed it with fruit-cup and
near-beer, and tried to look as if the “up-
lift” had gone to their heads and was giving
them the time of their lives. Miss Preston
Stanley, President of the Feminists, pro-
posed the toast of the guest, and Perth’s
woman M.P., Mrs. Cowan, cheered Mr.
Hammond’s work on anti-irrigation during
the W.A. elections. Mrs. John Fell uprose to
say a word or two, and Mayoress Gilpin handed
the guest a portrait of himself with the
heavyweight inscription : “Humanist, World’s
Citizen, Prohibitionist!” The gathering
could hardly be said to add to the gaiety of
nations, but it may have an influence on the
next election barometer.
New Mayoress Gilpin doesn’t Often appear
in public, but when she does she makes a
name for herself. According to one Sydney
daily, at the Feminist luncheon to Mr. Ham-
mond she “presented the guest with
a bronze plaque bearing his own head!” Go
down one. Salome!
Mrs. Dan Kelly had sent out an S.O.S. for
linen for the Mater Miserieordise Hospital
(Dr. Dan is carver-in-chief there), and the
response was staggering as to numbers.
Sisters Mrs. A. E. Hughes and Dorothy
Coffee helped with the entertaining, but the
breeze-sw r ept balconies of Warranilla and the
Hawaiian music plucked highest distinction
in this class. Clever May Courtenay operated
brilliantly on the piano, and the Conrick
lady poured out deep contralto waves. Pretty
little Mrs. Don Taylor topped the sheerest of
lacy white frocking with a black hat that
carried a chiffon ruffle about its crown; the
hostess, in ankle-length, shrimp-pink georg-
ettes, hovered about with a kindly eye for
all: slim Mrs. Bishop was rose-pink clad,
and Mrs, Mark Foy wore smart grey tailor-
ings. The result will be a linen chest de
luxe for the North Side hospital.
The Housewives’ Association had two
stars in its firmament in the Education
Buildings last week —Mrs. Cowan, M.L.A.,
of Westralia, and Mrs. Dale, who talked of
her Geneva Conference experiences. Mrs.
Cowan, looking small and fragile in her
black frocking, and clutching in a hand,
long-fingered and nervous, a bunch of purple
asters, had a word to say about woman in
public life. Later the meeting got back to
the pantry, so to speak, and recorded its
soul-quakings over the Sugar Agreement.
After much hand-gripping there was a surge
towards the lifts and the tea-party in honor
of Mrs. Cowan at the Mary Elizabeth.
Mary Pickford, as “Tess of the Storm
Country,” will help the children of the City
Mission this (Thursday! afternoon at King’s
Cross Theatre. Those invited are asked to
bring an article of warm clothing to comfort
the kiddies through the winter.
The Royal Welfare Society may have a
rival: there is talk of a Plunket Society,
mainly for the making use of the services of
Sister McMillan. Sister McMillan, who is
having trouble with the Welfare Society over
her dismissal from the matronshlp of Tresil-
lian, is an expert in the raising of better
babies, and it would be a pity, whatever the
cause of the quarrel, if her knowledge were
not made use of. The Plunket Society has
its headquarters in Dunedin (M.L.), and is
run on the Truby King system, the chief dif-
ference between its methods and the plan
adopted in Sydney being that the treatment
is carried into baby’s home. W. H. Mac-
queen secretaries the new venture; and Mrs.
Sydney Jamieson, Mrs. Tregarthen, French
Consul Campana and others have formed
themselves into a temporary committee.
Died at Chatswood on Feb. 28 a sweet-
mannered old lady, Mary Alexandrina Camp-
bell Dymock, widow of the late John Waugh
Dymock. Formerly of old-fashioned Jam-
beroo, the little lady nevef quite lost the
touch of Scots’ accent that she inherited
from her father, Dr. Menzies. Though long
ago Mrs. Menzies was counted a “dainty
young leddy,” she brought her little Austra-
lian daughters up in hardy bush ways. The
late Mrs. John Kinross —whose learned man,
the late Dr. Kinross, was the first Principal
of St. Andrew’s College—was one of the
Menzies sisters. Artist Godson has etched
a charming impression of Minna-Murra, the
old family home amongst the Illawarra
hills. Mary Alexandrina lived to pass her
80th milestone.
Melbourne artist Dora Wilson has filled
Gayfield Shaw’s attic with a few furlongs
of pretty ladies —mostly unclothed. Backs
well padded with firm flesh predominate, but
here and there is the front view of a girleen
who looks as though she has just stepped
from the bath. Dora Wilson is a brilliant
worker in pastels, and her draperies and
embroideries are things of exquisite charm
—for example, “The Mandarin Cloak.”
“The Shrine” is the study of a nude before
the crucifix; but why the lady couldn’t have
slipped on at least a kim. before indulging
in prayer is something of a mystery.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matt looked in at “Brewster’s Millions” at
the Theatre Royal the other night. Two Haw-
thorns blossomed in the vice-regal box, guarded by
General Chauvel (who married one of the pretty
Jopp girls of this town), Col. Parsons, Capt. Ham-
mond and John McDonnell. In the house were the
Lockhart Gibsons and other upholders of Brisbane
society—and the starlight shone down upon the
aristos and rabbitos with benign impartiality through
the open roof.
On the previous Saturday, his Ex. had bidden
the jazzers to come under the Government House
roof. The Digbys and Lady Belper, Berenis Cadell-
Garrick, Alice Hawthorn and Bebe Walsh, a lieut.-
colonel, two majors and a captain w r ere among the
toe-shakers, and there were no less than four doctors
to lend first aid.
When Brisbane Grammar celebrated its 54th
birthday Sir Matt and an A.D.C. watched the
cricket match betwixt the Old Boys and the New.
There was some furious tennis fought out on simi-
lar lines, and at night everyone dined largely amid
laudatory speeches delivered by the headmaster, the
president and others concerned.
A beeline is made for Cremorne these nights.
Humphrey Bishop wields a wary baton through the
“Tales of Hoffmann” during the week, and “Scratcher”
Ross has employed his pen on a seena and dance,
“Silhouette,” in which some very fine legs are
shown on a blue horizon and some problematical
ones discreetly hidden under grandmother’s crowd-
ing crinoline. Tenor Jaffey sings from a shadowy
background in an 18th-century garb.
The Hogarths’ permanent camp in Toowoomba
sported tea-tables decked with zinnias, blue salvias
and asters, to honor bride-elect Maud Wilcox by a
monster tea-drinking. Everybody brought a hanky
(not to weep into, but to stock a copper bowl-full
for the guest). Most of the rank and fashion of
Toowoomba sipped the bohay.
Sir Matt has promised to watch the High School
girls swim on 19th. Tea and flowers—in fact,
everything but the mermaids —will be put up to auc-
tion for the benefit of the swimmirg-pool fund.
Our friendly Gov. was lured to the Mothers’ Union
of the District Nursing Association the other day.
Archbishop Sharp presided, and the omniscient old
bachelor from Government House gave some sound
advice on various domestic matters.
Mrs. Sears gathered in a white enamel fountain-
pen and a leather writing-case at a tea-drinking
at Lennons’ before leaving for the Fog. Mrs.
Frendenberg was responsible for the tea-leaves in the
pot, and Mrs. Ted Theodore and Emily Bulcock
were among the dissipators.

RICH SOIL makes RICH PROFITS.
THERE is nothing more disappointing
or disheartening to a fruitgrower when,
after devoting the utmost care and atten-
tion to the cultivation of his orchard, to be
confronted with trees stunted in growth
and unhealthy in appearance.
This more frequently than not arises from
a lack of Nitrogen in the soil, and, if so,
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA will afford
a speedy and certain remedy.
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA
contains a higher percentage of readily soluble
NITROGEN than any other fertiliser, and when
applied to Fruit Trees at the rate of about one cwt. per
acre, is the most economical nitrogenous Plant Food
obtainable—it ensures healthy trees, and, as a conse-
quence, increased yields.

The opening of Parliament was almost a
sensational affair this session. The galleries
are usually crowded'for the event, but this
year there was something of a riot. Im-
portant dames arriving half-an-hour before
the ceremony and showing exclusively-tinted
tickets found they had no hope of a look-
in, let alone a seat. Women were packed on
the gallery steps, hanging on by chin and
claw to the railings. Two demure ladies
caused a sensation by tumbling on to the
corridor floor because their quarter-inch of
footing had given way, and a courteous
official had to pick them up and smooth their
ruffled plumage. The hapless shut-outs con-
soled themselves by prowling round the por-
trait gallery.
The Queen’s Hallites got the best view of
the procession across into the House—be-
wigged importants and the Man with the
Mace, followed by the new Ministers. P'rimin-
ister Bruce looked altogether lovely—the
cut of his clothes perfect, the stripe in his
shirt-front a poem. Few women went into
the stormy opening session. Most of them
were lured upstairs by a whisper of tea from
the rooms above the white marble staircase.
A special little room was devoted to the
Ministers’ and ex-Ministers’ wives. Mrs.
Bruce, perfectly groomed in navy blue and
black, was hostess. Mrs. Hughes, in dark
foulard with an entrancing turban, was
there with Helen, w T hose baby mouth showed
a determined set beneath her pink bonnet.
Helen has a decided idea that people are
not being kind to her beloved daddy. Daddy
himself was brilliant and talked incessantly.
The new Priminister came in and handed
cakes. Senator Pearce helped his brisk little
lady to entertain, and Watt also gave solid
assistance in the feeding. Marks came with
his prophetic air and his lady, who made a
picture in black and white. Big General
“Pompey” Elliott was with his dainty little
lady, and Dr. Page was there with a wife
dressed in soft autumn tints of brown. Mrs.
Keating, smart in dark blue, said that hubby
was busy defending a Tassy case. The tea-
party went on with chatter and excitement
untii dusk.
The crowds at Flemington on Saturday
were mostly male, and only lightly creamed
with the smartest. A strong combination of
dust and sunshine having boxed up the anti-
cipated autumn .dress revelations, woman-
kind turned up in over-worked summer frocks.
One notable exception sweltered unattrac-
tively in sable wrappings, which in cooler
circumstances would have been terribly
envied. The vice-regal Forster group perched
inconspicuously in the rear of their pen like
a bunch of sparrows, the feminine section
having plumped unanimously for brown—
barring Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who framed her
fairness in black. Mrs. Belly brightened
her brown head-covering with wallflowers,
while another of the vice-regal visitors hid
some good looks behind an outsize in tortoise-
shell rimmed specs. A keen watch was kept
for out-on-bail Nurse Mitchell, who had been
sighted picking losers where the bookies roar,
but no one spotted her out on the upper
circle, partly perhaps because modern mil-
linery makes one woman look so hopelessly
like another. Oscar Asche struck a broad-
comedy note in white pants, khaki coat and
straw decker. Lawrence Grossmith stepped
round with his wife, who was a study in
brown. Prime Minister Bruce, trying not
to appear too self-conscious, walked the ter-
race with Mrs. Stanley, smartly striped in
black and white silk. The Hilliard pair felt
more nervy than they seemed. They would
hatye gone home richer if their All Serene
and Sindbad the Sailor had come up to scratch.
An irruption of inter-State polo and rac-
ing enthusiasts has caused wavelets on the
dull surface of society. Mrs. Tommy Marks’s
dimpled loveliness makes her a persona grata
everywhere. Mrs. Duncan, in attractive chif-
fons! has brought her little Colin along.
Mrs. Tom Knox, of Sydney, and daughters
Nell and Nora are being provided with their
morning muffin and hot water at 7 by the
“Carngham” Russells. The Ken. Richardses
will support the polo week to the last chucka.
Sam Hordern is here greeting his many pals,
and Hugh Denison and his handsome spouse
have their eyes turned to the Sun. The
choice and poise of Mrs. Hugh’s chapeau is
admirable. Others that have dropped in are
Alfred Turnbull, without his chic wife, who
is in London, the Tony Horderns, the Dinny
Garvans, the Steenie Osbornes and the
“Eurythmic” Lee Steeres.
At the first Castles concert, “good style”
was mostly represented in the reserve, where
Lady Forster sported an edging of green to
the deep collar of her grey georgette gown,
Worn under a bottle-green chiffon cloak. Yet
the concert showed good cause why the Town
Hall should have been much fuller and the
crowd very dressy. A little of youthful
honey has departed from the Amy Castles
song, but her voice was in great order, her
notes flawless in a general way, and her in-
terpretation of such trying numbers as. the
“Mad Scene” from “Hamlet” (not “Lucia”)
and “One Fine Day” from “Butterfly” car-
ried prima -donna authority with it. Amy
is a big girl now, and her gown showed no
ankle to mention. It was a startling thing
in gold and bright red brocade, with clusters
of dark orange dahlias at the hips, not un-
suited to the substantial figuali. The highly
polished upstanding comb in her dark hair
had the appearance of tortoise-shell at a dis-
tance, but was said to be jet. Amy goes in
for the bonnie queenly type of deportment
these times, whereas sister Eileen, who is in
danger of beginning to look a trifle shrewish
despite her plumpness, affects a swinging
school-lass type of walk, which keeps the
back in a wriggle and would be quite the
thing on the tennis-ground. Eileen’s becom-
ing outfit —becoming to her way of locomo-
tion —was salmon pink crepe de Chine.
There was a roughness about her soprano
at the outset, but she improved, and her
sturdy top note finished a highly respectable
second to her sister’s.
Capt. Charlie Lempriere, with his wife
and young daughter, is off to Europe by
the Orsova. They expect to return with
Melba, who is Mrs. Lempriere’s sister. The
Dame, as all j the world knows, is to leave
for Australia about nine months hence with
her own opera co.
Moonee Valley was the only place to be
on Friday, when the opening polo match of the
inter-State struggle for the Stradbroke Cup
raised the dust. The course was thick with
expensive motahs from our haughtiest
garages. The affair was Governor-Gener-
alled, of course, the Forster couple having a
bodyguard of Pitt Riverses, Fred Pellys and
many other lesser lights. Her I3x. was
sheathed carefully in battleship-grey satin,
with radium lace on port and starboard.
The Pitt Rivers lady wore her navy crochet
silk trappings with her usual Diana-like
swish. Fawn and nigger brown clothed
Mrs. Fred Pelly; and Queensland’s Miss
Aileen Bell, who was included in the vice-
regal group, was turned out decoratively in
blue charmeuse. Mrs. Harry Creswick,
whose hubby is hon. sec. of the tournament,
wore a tobacco-velvet hat above her knitted
silk sheathings.
Apropos of the fact that she has joined
the Albert-street Conservatorium staff as
chief study teacher,
Gertrude Healey is
presented herewith in
a Stirling photo. She
is a Ballarat native,
has fiddled ever since
she can remember,
and, after winning a
handful of South-
street laurels, romped
in a winner.' fdt a

scholarship at the
mature age of 12.
During a course of
study in Berlin Ger-
trude had the luck
to be holidaying in
the Fog when the
Huns started to
wreck Belgium; so
she was spared the
sight of Fritz at home with the war, fever on
him. One of the young fiddler’s most pleas-
ant French memories is embodied in the
widow of Csesar Franck, with whom she
chummed up in Crapaud’s capital.
Bonnie, only daughter of solicitor F. N.
H. Atkyns, of Brighton and Portsea (he
has erected a country seat on one of the
minor crags of that resort), has promised
herself to young John Campbell Fitchett, a
son of Shaw Fitchett, of Life, and a brother
of the tennis-player.
At the opening-of-Parliament tea, which
is charged to the poor dear taxpayer, you
know, there has always been an audacious
pinching of the floral decorations, but the
invited guests had hitherto paused at pinch-
ing more than the flowers. This year,
though, the fair ticket-holders had no
scruples short of forks, crockery and table-
cloths. The charming pink carnations were
in pretty wicker baskets. They bolted with
the baskets as well as the carnations.
The Moonee Valley polo drew off the best-
dressed from the autumn lawn-tennis tour-
ney, which opened on Friday to a poor house
—mostly enthusiasts of the game and indi-
vidual barrackers. Jim Fairbairn and
another of the clan had thrown over their
singles chances in order to straddle polo
steeds. Nevertheless it was a great day
out in the belated sunniness. Even the
tennis girl has lengthened her sports petti-
coats, and bloomer knee-hems have gone into
retirement. Miss Bere, who just managed
to score off the ex-schoolgirl champ., Ruth
Stephen, whirled in trim white silk under a
rainbow-hued hat, and top-notcher Miss
Boyd advanced another step on her triumphal
career.
Mrs. Artie Staughton and daughter Lorie
are back from a course of foreign travel;
but the girl won’t return her Saratogas to
the family attic. They are stuffed with
trousseau chiffonery, which will be called out
a few months hence when the groom-to-be,
the Oliphant Shaws’ son and heir, gets back
to his native Western District. That dis-
trict, bv the way, he has not sighted since he
left it as a youngster. After the wedding he
will carry the attractive girleen off to
S’Afric'a, where they hope to prolong the
honeymoon for a few years.
The Robert Harpers’ youngest hope,
Arthu'", whose matrimonial shackles were
struck off bv a decree nisi, is preparing to
forge new links at the end of the month. The
bride-elect is Mollie Lock. As a bright
little V.A.D. she lost the lower end of one
arm in the laundry of our first Soldiers’
Rest Home. A steam mangle was the cul-
prit. After the tragic mishap she went to
her ex-Anzac brother’s sheep-run at Ard-
mona, and thence, after four years of fresli-
air tonic, she emerged plump and smiling.
No one ever heard a whimper from _ the
plucky litfle miss, who now sports a silver
medai lettered, “For King and Country,” the
gift of George Rex.
The other Saturday Wesley’s headmaster
Adamson, as president of the Lost Dogs’
Home at North Melbourne, with the help of
his committee staged a tea-and-cake frivol
in the new'garage at the canine sanctuary.
Crowds turned up. Many fetched sweet bis-
cuits to treat the derelicts; more opened
their purses after inspection for the good
of the cause. The committee, by the way,
is bewailing the temporary loss of the bon:,
sec., barrister Morley, who, with his equally-
helpful wife, is off on a trip to England.
While everybody was enjoying the affair a
howl of protest was raised by a beautiful
little terrier in the condemned pen, who
had been sent out by its owners for destruc-
tion because they were leaving the city and
didn’t want anyone else to have him. A
rush of would-be purchasers set in, but the
law was against them. Without the owners’
permit, which was not forthcoming, the little
dog’s unwarranted death sentence had to
stand.
The Gattanach pair are having a sorrow-
ful stay across-seas. They reached London
to find' a cable telling them of the loss of
their handsome seven-year-old son whom
they had left behind. Scarlet fever carried
the’ little chap off in a few days.
The Housewives trimmed the Independent
Hall, Collins-street, with purple asters,
crochet lace and tablecloths covered with
cake and coffee when they held their annual
meeting the other day. Mrs. Glencross,
wrapped from head to heel in nigger brown
and a torrent of speeches, handed over the
chair to the new president, Mrs. Barnard,
an ex-Mayoress of Kew. Between the sugar-
agreement question and an election cam-
paign, Mrs. Glencross is so tired ; she simply
must have a rest, she explained, and the
Housewives, true to, their battle-cry of
economy, saved splitting their four-buttons
with clapping, waving their hankies instead
whenever they were stirred to excitement.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer has forgotten the cares
and responsibilities of her philantliropicfilly-
disposeqt life in Melbourne, and is angling
for trout in the Speck. Probably by this
: she has ; devised a scheme whereby the fish
may be caught painlessly. The lady’s latest

The Shakspearean Society hoisted a
“house-full” sign at the Queen’s Hall on
Friday night for the 1923 opening stunt.
Members led off with a paper all about
Stratford-on-Avon, and heavily punctuated
with lantern slides, by Dr. Nyulasy, who
knows his subject from the dramas to Anne
Hathaway’s cottage furnishings. Inciden-
tally, there was a good deal of talk about
Society affairs, including the suggested
Shakspearean memorial. This, contended the
veteran Dr. Deeper, who did most of the
talking, should at least equal Bobby Burns’s
local effigy in size and magnificence.
The Lyceum Club commandeered Maud
Grantham for a high-brow-but-pleasant re-
cital on Monday night. The lady treated
the cultured collection to scraplets of Oscar
Wilde, J. M. Barrie and Stephen Leacock.
There was coffee to follow, hot and chilled,
with the usual sandwich.
To habitues of the State public offices it
looked the other day as if the. clock had
been put back 20 years. Chief Justice
Irvine walked out looking as spruce as
when he was Premier, and not far behind
him came Mrs. Bleasby, Tommy Bent’s
daughter—now a grandmother. The C.J-
had been having a talk to Acting-Premier
McPherson, and Mrs. Bleasby was one ot
the representatives of 30 charities who had
been to her dad’s old room to discuss 'how a
couple of people should be elected to the
Charity Board. One of the two must be a
woman, and some of them think they might
do worse than give Mrs. Bleasby the job.
The Free Kindergarten Hostel shelters
others besides teachers who are studying
kindergarten methods. The happy family
includes a doctor, a
vet., a gardener and
even a woman car-
penter. You see the
last of these here in
a Lafayette photo.
—Miss Langdon, an
Adelaide girl who is
studying at the ’Var-
sity, and has made
her home at the
Hostel. God meant
to make this girl a
carpenter, so much
cunning is in her
clever fingers, and
she backs it up
with a mathematical
brain. Work on small
models in her spare
time led to such ex-
cellent results that she has now a lucrative
craft in model- and toy-making. A handy
shed in the Hostel grounds has been turned
into a workshop, which Miss Langdon
fitted up herself. She took an order for a
children’s model playhouse, and this she
produced in such exquisite detail that it
set a fashion in Hawthorn and Kew.
The Sol. Macpherson junket at Warrawee
was voted scrumptious. Mrs. Mac. was
in gold tissue and lade, with purple
bacchanalian grapes spread on her
frock and brow. Some inter-Staters
looked in, including Theo Marks, petite
Mrs. Ken. Richards, bright as a new-
minted penny, and the Tony Horderns —she
looking like a delectable pink sundae with
silver frostings. In the chiffon contest Mrs.
Rex Flatau scored well in dawn pink
charmeuse scrambled with pearls. Primin-
ister Bruce and his wife took a cheery
interest in the evening’s doings. Mrs. Jack
Fisken, who calls the hostess “daughter, ’
draped her handsome person in inky black
with an outbreak of diamonds on the hip,
while the other daughter, Mrs. Tommy Gran-
tham, burst into beads of black, green and
red, which had a French tang about them.
The invited discussed their bottles and birds
amid pink cactus dahlias.
At the Princess’s Theatre the other night
an astonished lolly-boy, in the shrill tone
which ensures an instantaneous hush, called
out to his mate in the gallery: “Eh—Bill;
take a twig —that don’t look too good in a
box, eh?” “ That” was a Melbourne beauty
serenely puffing a cigarette in one of the
boxes, defiant alike of curious eyes and
regulations against smoking in theatres.
A coo-ee from Adelaide: —
A vast crowd turned up at the Outer Harbor for
the inter-State motor-boat race, and Bymills, Bow-
mans, MacFarlanes and other enthusiasts chartered
launches, took aboard provisions, and bade their
friends watch proceedings from the decks instead of
from railway trucks on the wharf. Interest petered
out, however, with the fiasco of the Meteor-Tortoise
collision. The dinner on the Monday evening was
a cheerful gathering, chiefly remarkable for the nice
things that were said by people who looked as though
they meant ’em. Where they couldn’t be quite so
nice they maintained a discreet silence.
Rival shows on the day of the race were Boy Scouts
and Girl Guide rallies. The Scouts mustered at the
parade-ground, and were inspected and belauded by
his Ex. and Sir Alfred Pickford, who then went on
to Government House and took similar stock of a
dozen or so Girl Guide companies, with the Moulden
dame and Miss Violet Balph in charge and Alvida
Bridges as one of the Guides. The visiting Commis-
sioner is having a strenuous time, and Scout stocks
are already up 100 or so per cent.
The Commercial Travellers’ Club broke out in a
new place the other day and gave a tea-party, with
president E. J. Clarke’s wife as hostess. There was
music as well as tea, and good-bye presents to the
wives of a couple of members who are off to the
eastern States.
The Owen Smyths, who have never quite settled
down in the Cold Country, have decided to come
back and pitch their tent here. Their widowed
daughter and her two small children come with
them.
Members of the Tubercular Soldiers’ Society have
shown what they think of what Miss Cleggett has
done for them by giving, her a wristlet watch. She
has secretaried the society from the start, and has
never slackened in her task, though the war is slip-
ping into the limbo of ancient history.
From England comes news of the death of Mrs.
J. S. O’Hallpran, widow of a one-time sec. of the
Royal Colonial Institute and a daughter of the
Capt. Henry Simpson who once lived at Ridge Park
in this village. She and her husband were connected
with big clans here---Wrights, O’Hallorans, Milnes,
Simpsons, Connors and the rest.
Also gone over the hill, Mrs. T. H. Ayliffe, who
came to S. Aus. in ’54 with her uncle, the late L. J.
Pelham, who was Associate to Judge W earing long
years ago.

MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
The fastest Newmarket on record, wind as
well as course being- in its favor, was a confusing
spectacle. Easingwold looked a probable winner as
the 30 horses came in a broken line within two
furlongs of the winning post. Closer home than that
the Westralian, well out, and All Serene, running
near him, were a likely-looking pair of reds and
purples—purple spots in one case, and sleeves and
cap in the other. Meanwhile Sunburst was on the
extreme outside of the course, where winners mostly
spring from. In the end Sunburst’s red and black sleeves
flashed past the judge’s box with a distinct advan-
tage over the other two reds. No one could view
the finish of the Newmarket without seeing red.
What an excellent trainer of these sprinters and
nailers is Eric Connolly! His record with Rostrum
and Sunburst is a credit to his judgment and train-
ing skill. Last year Rostrum won the Hawksburn
Handicap at Caulfield, previous to annexing the
Newmarket a week later,. Then he had a rest of‘ six
months ere he went to Sydney and won a race
preliminary to capturing the Epsom, after which
he ran a second at the A.. 1.0. meeting—four wins
and a second for his last five appearances in Con-
nolly’s colors. Sunburst's record at the time of
writing, had been three wins and a half-head beating
since Connolly produced him on Boxing Day at
Caulfield. On Jan. 1 he won the Standish up the
Flemington straight. Favorite for the Oakleigh
Plate he was unlucky, as it now appears, to get beaten
on the post by Chelidon. A fortnight later he
started first favorite for the Newmarket, and carried
out the contract like the honest horse the trainer
has made him.
Note the difference between the consistency cf
Sunburst and the failures of the ones he has beaten
or been beaten by. Weedah and Sonora, close
secojid and third in the Standish, have been dire
disappointments since, likewise Chelidon and Deme-
trius, the placed winner and third in the Oakleigh.
Demetrius was declared to have had cruel luck in the
Oakleigh, and again in the Futurity Stakes excuses
were made for the big, handsome fellow. No
excuses were shouted aloud for Rostrum and Sun-
burst, because they never needed them. Connolly
said that Sunburst probably lost the Oakleigh through
having been eased in the conventional manner as a
matter of jockey’s policy, a policy that didn’t
work with this son of Bernard. Apparently the
trainer knew just how the machine should be treated.
He finished more strongly, in the process of running
every furlong in 12sec., than in the slower race over
a shorter course. It was his day, to be sure. Sun-
burst was a picture of health and condition. But
Connolly’s sprinters are always pictures of health and
condition when he bids the world believe in them.
Oaserta’s return to form just when stable-com-
panion Whittier seems to have gone a bit off, pleases
evervbody who “has the interests of the turf at
heart.” He had nothing to beat in the Leger,
but he did it handsomely, the victory being in
strict accordance with his unexpected third in the
Futurity on the previous Saturday.
After the strangely in-and-out Harvest King had
beaten Eurythmic at w.f.a. in the Essendon Stakes
the moral mostly drawn from the result was that
both horses are now roguish, and the older rogue
has lost his old determination. This’ was Harvest
King’s second time of doing the same thing over
the same 10 furlongs, but between the Melbourne
Stakes and last Saturday the handsome black had
run some verv bad races, whereas ? Eurythmic has
been only a moderately unsatisfactory representative
of his old self. He seems indisposed to get going
early or to put ardent spirit into his belated
run. It is a good, in fact a great, run up to a
point, and then Eurythmie seems to have had as
much effort-making as he wants. Punters complain
that Eurythmie is always ridden in the same way,
but seemingly he is always ridden in the only way
he will run. When Easingwold beat him over nine
furlongs Eurythmie carried 9st. 121 b. When Salatis
beat him over seven furlongs his weight was lOst.
71b., but on Saturday he carried only 9st. 21b. over
10 furlongs, when he played second fiddle to Har-
vest King. He has ceased to put his heart into the
finish. Shillirglee, who made the pace hot for a
while, gave no evidence of the stamina that rumor
credited him with. It was remarked in the bird-
cage that the English horse had never before looked
so well, and now was his chance to distinguish him-
self if he wgs ever going to cut a dash in an import-
ant handicap.
Prince Cox, who won the Australian Cup at
2's from James Wilson’s Woorak colt, Sir Andrew,
and Stalwart, has been a profitable purchase for
Samuel Hordern and “Constable,” who bought him
from the ex-Westralian sportsman, Peter Fox. Eric
Connolly was another who rejoiced at the victory,
having coupled the winner in doubles with Sun-
burst. The Prince has captured three good races
since he was sold out of “Baron” Brown’s stable.

“0.K.”: In my opinion that good sports-
man, the late William Reid, narrowly escaped the
celebrity of breeding a phenomenal racehorse in
Uncle Sam. But for his being a slave to a habit
which made him comparatively weak on his pins
Uncle Sam would have done far greater things
than two Caulfield Cups and a Toorak Handicap.
The tall, lengthy horse was a four-year-old ere he
showed his mettle, but he didn’t show it for long.
In August, 1912, he won a welter race at Caulfield
in commanding style. In October, whilst he was
still behaving reasonably, he won the Toorak Handi-
cap easily, giving 191 b. to little Almissa, who won
the Williamstown and Australian Cups the same sea-
son. A week later Sam won the Caulfield Cup
brilliantly from Lady Medallist. His weight was
nothing—only 7st. 61b.- —but weight was a small
consideration to so big a horse. Uncle’s final
rush proclaimed him an exceptional animal. Only
champions ever come with that kind of dash in
the best of handicap company. All that remained
for Uncle Sam to do was to win the Melbourne
Cup, at 7st. 61b. (the same weight as he carried at
Caulfield), before the handieappers started to “crush”
him. But when Melbourne Cup day arrived the
splendid-looking beast was a sad sight. Less than
an hour before the race he stood trembling in the
birdcage, bathed in perspiration. It dropped off
him. Stable boys commented jeeringly on his
appearance. In the race he was on his knees almost
when a scrimmage happened at the back of the
course. Lambert, who was aboard, likened Uncle
Sam to a kid, sent sprawling by every push he gets.
He was weak on the legs he ought to have been
so strong on, but in spite of his condition Uncle
Sam finished a good third to Piastre and Hal-
lowmas, making up a lot of ground in the last
half-mile. Mark Whitty succeeded in getting him
sufficiently himself, two years later, to win another
Caulfield Cup, this time under the respectable
burden of Bst. 71b. But the misguided Uncle never
could be regarded as “fit.” Had he been thoroughly
hard and healthy none of his contemporaries would
have touched him.

Those fine colts Soorak and Cliffdale re-
appeared in the Three-year-old Handicap, run over
a mile and 22 yards, at Warwick Farm (N.S.W.),
on Saturday. Cliffdale was thought to be more
forward than the other, and a pot of money went
on him at s’s and 4’s, Soorak being spasmodically
supported at B’s and 6’s. The Newcastle colt and
Oyeius made the running to the turn, where Cliff-
dale faded out, and, settling the field in a few
strides, Soorak romped home lengths ahead of
Cyclus and El Dorado in the fair time of lmin.
43sec. The winner and Cliffdale have both been
nominated for the Doncaster Handicap, which is
likely to suit them better than the St. Lpn-er. Cliff-
dale, especially, looks the very cut of a Doncaster
horse, and with another month’s condition on him
he may be equal to repeating the Speciality act.
However, Speciality was let in with 7st. 91b., and
the handieappers are taking care of the three-year-
olds this season.

“Vaou”: Though legally exterminated
many years ago the M.L. Tommy Rook is a lively
corpse. I was getting hair removed in a South
Island hamlet when a heated argument started about
a bet. “Well,” said the man with the stripper,
“here’s the rules of the M.L. Bookmakers’ Associa-
tion to settle it.” Settled it was.
T. K.
FITCHETT,
a Victorian
exponent of
tennis and a
competitor
for the
State title.
There were
91S entries for
the autumn
tennis tourna-
ment, which be-
gan in Mel-
bourne last week,
but it is doubtful if the fixture will be as
important as last year, seeing that Hawkes and the
N.S.W. cracks are absent. It would have done Nor-
man Brookes no harm to turn out for the doubles.
As it is, the tennis public will have to feast its
eyes on a lot of elimination battles between first-
rate but uninspiring pennant men and women-, inter-
rupted by an occasional striking performance by
Wood or Patterson as they rip their way through to
the finals. On paper the two internationals look
like fighting out the finish on Saturday, though
there is a possibility of a surprise in the fact that
Wood was palpably out of touch last Friday, and
was gTound-stroking much below his Davis Cup form.
It is unfortunate for him and Patterson that they
don’t get any practice massacring the rabbits, the
disadvantage being exceptional in the case of Pat-
terson, inasmuch as his leaping service so paralyses
his opponents in the earlier rounds that he is rarely
afforded a decent rally for a rehearsal of the shots
which he will be compelled to bring into play on
the last day. The only men likely to put up some
sort of a struggle against the champion are Wood,
Wertheim and young Mclnnes, but the latter two
are unlikely to worry him much.
South Aus. is taking on the cheerful task
of playing Vie., N.S.W. and Westralia tennis all
at the same time. A lot of good young players will
get their chance. Roy Taylor, the yld champion,
just back from England and nearly as good as
ever (though a five-set single would probably find
him out), asserts roundly that the State has never
before had so many good men.
In Sydney on Saturday Clive Stuart, a
15-year-old member of a Mosrnan club, swam 50yds.
in 25sec., and 100yds. in 58 4-ssec., wonderful times
for a youngster. Also Vera Pawley, who is the
same age, got over 100 yards in 73sec. No other
city in the world has a faster collection of kid-
swimmers than the boys and girls who disport in
the Sydney baths and beaches. But somehow they
don’t train on.

“Adelaide”: The dinner with which the
motor-boat racing in Adelaide (B. 1/3/23) was to
have ended was duly held, but there was a certain
gloom about the proceedings. Major Donkin, who had by
the afternoon’s inquiry been deprived of the trophy,
sent an apology, although staying in the same
hotel. Kind things were said about the local
Millawa, which had won one heat outright, and Miss
Brisbane, which, being a model of consistency though
riot a front-rank flier, ran second throughout. If
consistency is to count —and, if not, the first race
might very well be the final and only one—a piler
up of second places might surely be allowed to
try its luck in the final.
* * * •
“D. Batman” : There is talk of “Digger”
Evans re-entering the ring. lie showed champion-
ship form against Jimmy Wilde, but failed to repro-
duce it in Australia. The manner in which “Dig-
ger” and his handler secured training-quarters in
London immediately after the Armistice had a touch
of guile. Evans wanted Hughes to help him, but
was never able to see King William. However,
through the kindly offices of a Digger then holding
down a job on headquarters, a cunningly-worded mis-
sive was sent to the 0.1. C. of one of the smaller
A.I.F. depots. After pompously mentioning that
“Evans has applied to the Prime Minister, the Hon.
W. M. Hughes, for an opportunity to secure quarters
which will enable him to prepare for contests
in which he proposes to engage,” the writer adroitly
added that it was “the policy of the A.I.F. to
encourage members of the forces in such pursuits,”
and suggested that “you might be able to assist
by applying for the addition of these men to your
staff, and allotting suitable quarters.” Delighted at
the hint that he would be pleasing the Priminister,
the 0.1.0. nearly fell over himself in his hurry to make
the pug and his rubber-down comfortable. Probably
he still wonders why Hughes didn’t hand him a
knighthood, or at least an 0.8. E.
Bobby Gray stopped little Mendies in 10
rounds at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night.
But considering that he weighed the best part of
a stone heavier it wasn’t a particularly meritorious
achievement. Mendies received a shattering punch in
the first round, was down four times in the fourth,
and his right eye went out of action in the sixth.
The massacre continued until the poor little devil’s
other eye was damaged. Then it was called off.

Les Munro, the consistent Queensland
cyclist, won the one-mile amateur championship
of the continent at Brisbane on Saturday. H. Broad-
bent, the Victorian, was second, and Coppins
(N.S.W.), third ; time 2min. 22sec. Seventeen-year-
old George Dempsey (N.S.W.) collared the five-
mile title from Broadbent and A. Maier (N.S.W.)
in 12min. 40see. ; but they were the only three
to finish, 13 riders, eight of them Queenslanders,
coming down. When the last of the local men
toppled over some of the crowd got so wild that
they had to be forcibly restrained from clearing
the fence and dealing it out to all and sundry.
Amateur cycling is a tempestuous pursuit.
* * * *
“D.’l: The re-instatement of Lawton, the
Q. Rhodes scholar, whom the fool-authorities of the
English Rugby Union suspended because he had
played' the League game in Brisbane, makes con-
fusion worse confounded. We all know what a
professional means in the spirit, though the article
is hard to indicate in words owing to the chaotic state
of the rules. A man is not necessarily what sensible
people regard as a pro. because he plays 13-a-side Rugby.
Yet the rules make him one, and it was on such grounds
that Lawton was declared to have infringed amateur-
ism. A man should not become a pro. for swim-
ing or boxing with pros.—though hitherto no mercy
has been shown to one who has done either. A man
should not be banned for riding races against pros.,
and he is not; and he should not be banned for
running races against them, though he is. Lawton
was declared a pro. for playing the League form of
Rugger; yet, the most fashionable amateur football
club in England (the Corinthians) plays League
Soccer. And here is where the argument for the
re-instatement of Lawton, no doubt, came in. The
touchstone of professionalism is clearly neither the
game that is played nor those with whom it is
played, but the money that is paid. The only
true professional sportsman is the , one who lives
on the game, just as the only true professional actor
is one who depends on acting for a livelihood.
Some of the most disreputable professionalism in
England is associated with Soccer, which game, accord-
to Stanley Harris—the famous Old Corinthian- —is
now a sheer business. And some of the purest
sport in England is also associated with Soccer.
Why not have the rules altered to say, in the
briefest language, that an amateur may play, Swim,
fight or race with whom he likes, and that he
shall only lose his status if he is shown to be
subsisting entirely by one of these activities? No
other arrangement will prevent a series of those
rows that are the ruin of sport.
* * * *
“Centurion” : Sammy Woods, who has re-
signed the secretaryship of the Somerset County
C. C., wiih which he has been associated for 34
years, is the only Australian who has played in
Rugger and cricket internationals. Several English-
men have gained the double, notably A. IJ, Hornby
and Reg Spooner, but no Australian has done it
except Sammy, who was born at Ashfield 56 years
ago. Incidentally, Paul Clauss, the Scottish half-

the writer were the only men he had ever seen
drink a tankard of beer at half-time without
becoming waterlogged. We had that gift, at least,
in common.

“Centurion”: Tell “Matahari” (B.
l/3/’23), apropos of his remark that most of our
champions kept the home fires burning in 1914-18,
that the N.S.W. Rugby Union not only closed down
during the war but sent over 70 per cent, of its
active members into the scrum. The team which
defeated the All Blacks last year included at
least eight wearers of the bronze badge. The bal-
ance were mostly at school when the final whistle
went in 1918.
* * * *
“J.D.”: Archie Maclaren, whose scornful
words about M.L. cricket have given offence in cer-
tain quarters, is a type that only England produces
in bulk, and that is growing rare even there since
the war came and drove what used to be the leis-
ured classes to work. The Maclarens, Warners,
C. B. Frys and W. G. Graces, of England, are the
Peter Pans of sport: they reach the age of 18 or
so, and to all intents and purposes remain there
till they die. You meet them all over the world,
kindly and well-meaning, but intensely critical,
wearing their M.C.C. ties and Free Foresters hat-
ribbons (or an I. Zingari or Incogniti or County or
some other color scheme), and always they are
talking of the only things that really interested
them in the sixth form at school or as “freshers”
at their University. They are bitterly condemnatory
of the unusual in dress, accent, deportment and
manners (especially where servants arc concerned),
cooking, methods of playing games and a thousand
other things. Each regards
himself as a lone Digenis Ak-
ritis of “good form”; and it
must be admitted that they
make a brave stand against
the Empire’s outer barbarians.
It concerns them little when
inevitably the barbarians grow
restive under the goad. As
schoolboys and undergraduates
they have seen “townies” re-
act in the same manner to
the efforts of their superiors
to instruct and elevate them:
it did not deter them from
pressing on with the good
work then, and it does not
deter them now. There are
other English types who
possess this divine gift of eter-
nal boyishness—a gift which
carries with it all boyhood’s
naive snobbishness and conde-
scension and friendliness.
Middle-aged army officers often
display it, for example. But
to see it in its highest expres-
sion one needs to seek out a
50-year-old amateur who has
played international or county
cricket ever since he left his
public school. Tn short, such
a one as Maclaren.
A. C. WILKINSON,
member of the M.C.C.
team. lie left before
the others to rejoin his
regiment.
in an interesting three-days’ match at Syd-
ney Maelaren’s team made an excellent -showing
gainst a N.S.W. side that included nine Inter-
nationals, and had a bit the better of the draw.
They seo red 275 and 296; N.S.W. 314 and five
wickets (Collins, Bardsley, Macartney, Andrews and
Taylor) for 102. F. S. Calthorpe made the only
century of the match—llo in the Englishmen's
second innings—but, supremely useful though his
contribution was, he was missed four times. Far
more entertaining to watch were Chapman’s 91 and
yg f or the visitors and Taylor’s 73 and 52 for
the home team. Bardsley’s 90 and Kippax’s 59
n.o. were, also bright displays. The outstanding
bowlers were Freeman (7 for 133), Scotc
(7 for 144), Gibson (7 for 182) and
Mailey (8 for 209). Both sides fielded well,
Chapman, at cover-point, and Oldfield, behind the
wickets, being superb. Oldfield, who runs a flourish-
ll!n sports business in Sydney, caught four English-
men and let only four byes pass him during the
match. All going well, he is sme to be the Aus-
tralian stumper in the next lest. #
_ ’Basil : There would be a lot in Andy S
point of view (B. 22/2/’23) if umpires hadn t the
*iff b t to reverse their first judgments regarding l.b.w s
anf l catches behind, and call the batsman back to the
crease. As a matter of fact, this has been done on
}\vo or three occasions, and the only reason why it
hasn t become the general practice is that the sport-
ing press and the public insist on the umpire s inf,alli-
Mit.V, and buttress this absurd delusion with the
statement that the umpne s decision must not be
questioned. It is not ecessa y or o.e de t

THE TIGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Methodist Conference in Sydney this week
horse-racing was stigmatised as “the tiger in the
jungle.’’
Brethren, watchful be and wary! On each day’s
itinerary
Beasts and reptiles grimly eye you as you pass.
Metaphorical gorillas lurk around suburban villas,
There are serpents hid in every patch of grass;
Fearsome birds of prey may mark you as in daylight
or in dark you
Venture out upon your crust-pursuing course;
Wheresoe’er you are a ranger every clump may spell
a danger,
But the tiger of the jungle is the Horse.
Though the wolf of vEsop’s fable you may feel
supremely able
To keep from sniffing dose around your door—
Though the booze with fang of adder never makes
you gladder, madder
And, subsequently, sadder any more —-
Though you render “Deo gratias” that no vampire-
like Aspasias
Still find your veins of nutriment a source—
Still there’s left a beast carnivorous to evoke a
“Lord Deliver Us!”
While the tiger of the jungle is the Horse.
Every other forest-scourer and potential devourer
We’ll assume that you have knocked upon the head ;
Nevermore while you are straying will they come
your steps waylaying,
You may safely disregard them now they’re dead.
But the tiger, striped of torso, that the Methodists
deplore so,
The Horse that with such burning words they biff,
He may make you rue his cunning when he’s fit
and full of running,
But the danger’s often doubled —when he’s stiff!

“Pantagruel”: A lady resident of Mackay
(Q.) claims to have just completed the
longest uninterrupted railway journey ever
done in Australia. She travelled from Perth
to Mackay, 4076 miles. The journey occu-
pied 168 travelling hours, and involved 11
changes.
J. O’Neill Brennan, who has been asso-
ciated with the importation of Pommies to
Queensland for over 30 years, lost his job
the other day through being over 65 years of
age. E. H. Abell. Assistant Under-Sec. to
the late P. J. McDermott, is trying on his
empty shoes.
Old Judge Gordon, of S.A., who takes
extraordinary care over his sentences, has
handed out seven years and 15 lashes to a
young man who took a girl not quite 12
from her suburban home into the hills for
nefarious purposes. The case has started
the inevitable discussion as to sterilisation
being more merciful to the sinner—who may
be a good citizen in other respects—and
obviously a better safeguard to the com-
munity.
“4641”: The 1000th Y.C. awarded was
gained by an Australian, Private H. Dalziel
(N.Q.). It was at the battle of Hamel,
July 4, 1918 —the occasion when several
Yankees, in their eagerness to get at grips
with Fritz, left their own units-in-reserve,
and hid in the long grass in No Man’s Land,
waiting for the zero hour, to join the Diggers
as they hopped the bags. It was stated at
the time that W. M. Hughes was a spectator
of this engagement.
Died recently in the Cold Country, John
Graeme Blundell Fulton, grandson of the
late John Blundell, a proprietor of the Wel-
lington (M.L.) Evening Post. lie was a
young man of many parts—-scientist, pianist,
bug-hunter, soldier and chess-player, mixing
them all with cheerful abandon. The war
took him from Wellington to England, but
the authorities headed him off the trenches
into a laboratory, and while juggling with
retorts and crucibles he contract' d the. lin-
gering illness that eventually finished him.
“F.C.8.”: “V.C.’s” sprightly interest in
the subject of house names strikes a respon-
sive chord in this bosom. My enthusiasm
for the study dates from a recent Sunday
when the solution, in a short space of time,
of two remarkable examples, to wit, “Dun-
wandrin” and “Weelivere,” left me in a
mild glow of pleasure at my own perspica-
city. I suggest that the Society for the
Solution of Name-plates be founded forth-
with, and that the two examples quoted con-
stitute the test in the qualifying examina-
tion.
“Timo”: Among a recent batch of applica-
tions for a vacant within-the-service position
up north was one who told the truth rather
too plainly. Wrote the applicant: “I do not
know what special qualifications, if any, are
necessary, but, whatever they might be, 1 I am
as confident of being able to satisfactorily fill
the position as I am certain I will not be
given the opportunity.” And not only did he
fail to get the job he was applying for, but
he lost the one he was holding. A junior
with a gift for this sort of irony is naturally
abhorrent to his departmental heads.
“Dido”: The up-to-date management of
St. Mark’s, Fitzroy, where they run the
silent drama instead of reverberating ser-
mons on Sunday nights, is now providirg
midday meals for girls from adjacent fac-
tories on the cafetaria plan, and the new
vestry, a young one, indulges in dances after
its meetings. A reformed hotel and a pula's
de danse will be the next additions: Then
demands will doubtless arise for an oyster
saloon, a hair-dressing establishment, a
manicure and massage parlor* a converted
tobacconist’s, a delicatessen shop, a millinery
department and a pawnbrokery; and the
additions will have to be made if the pastor’s
ambition to be all things to all men is to
be realised.
“The Moa” : Maoriland is just finishing its
Otira tunnel, which has been under construc-
tion for 20 years, and the trains are to run
through in April, so that east and west will
be one, and there will be no more Southern
Alps. It is the longest tunnel in the Empire,
and there are only six longer in the world,
the first five in the European Alps and the
sixth in Colorado (U.S.A.). Nervous visi-
tors will be glad to know that the perfora-
tion is in a fairly solid pai’t of the country,
quite unlike the Hot Lake district, whefe
people poke walking-sticks into the ground
and watch boiling water spurt out, or the far-
north, where 100-odd miles of thin country
hangs on by such a narrow neck to the rest
of the island that the peninsula waves about
in an ordinary breeze.
“Ashmead”: “P.X.” (B. l/2/‘23) speaks
of France’s generosity to her soldiers. Re-
minds me that the day before peace was
signed at Versailles I went to the Gare de
Lyons to catch my train for Nice, and at
the ticket-window plumped down a wad of
frogs to pay the first-class fare. The waxed
mo behind the wicket wobbled to the effect
that I might prefer a soldier’s ticket. I
suspected that this meant I might be rele-
gated to one of those notorious horse-boxes,
and naturally demurred. However, the
shoulder-shrugger was adamant, and com-
pelled me to take a soldier’s fare, which, to
my great content, proved to be only a
quarter of the full charge, and carried with
it all privileges that the civvy ticket would
have furnished. That’s the way France said
“Merci” for services rendered.
“K.P.” on a Japanese diversion: —
The Jap is nothing if not imitative. A decade
cr so back one of him sought a better world by
jumping over the Kegon waterfall, near Nikko, a
clear drop of 250 ft. The notion became fashion-
able, and since then this famous beauty-spot pro-
duces its regular crop of victims annually. The
shinju, or “love suicide” (the word means literally
“middle heart”), is perhaps the most popular form.
Generally the lovers are of opposite sexes, though
instances • attributable to quasi-Lesbian motives are
not unknown. Parental opposition or an obstruc-
tive husband or wife prevents their union. The
drill of the manoeuvre appears to be- pretty con-
stant: a letter of farewell, explanation and direc-
tion ; an Elinor Glyn one week (though this depends
on finances) at a village inn ; the composition and
affixing of an ode or poem to a convenient tree;
the tying together of the pair by the girl’s obi or
sash ; finally the leap into the unknown. Other
localities besides Kegon are, patronised, and the
police when endeavoring to trace a missing pair al-
ways communicate first with those localities which
past experience has shown to be most productive
of results.


That Elusive Something.
By “PHLOX.”
husband is flirting with a pretty
I dark woman.”
“The wretch!”
“He’s asking her to take afternoon tea
with him,” went on the fortune-teller,
nothing abashed by her client’s interjection.
“Where are they going for tea?”
“I can’t tell you that, but at present
they’re dancing.”
“Is my husband dancing?”
“He is.”
“Oh, dear, what would you advise me to
do?”
“I did not undertake to advise you,
madam, but to tell your fortune. Half-a-
crown, please!”
Mrs. Marsden left the fortune-teller with
rage in her heart and revenge in her soul.
Who was this Woman, she asked herself, who
WaS usurping her husband’s affections? That
explained his attitude towards her lately.
He had begun to criticise her, and pass un-
complimentary remarks about her figure and
her complexion.
Indeed, he had hinted that she Was passd.
Why, there was her husband and the
woman walking towards her. John has
recognised me, she thought; now I wonder
What he’ll have to say for himself. That
fortune-teller is certainly a clever woman.
“How fortunate We met you, Mary. This
is Miss Heath—our supervisor of agencies,
who has done such good business for our
publications. ■ We wei'e just going to have
a cup of tea while we talk over business
matters, and it will be nice for you to come,
too.”
Mrs. Marsden gave Miss Ileath a formal
bow, and a cold, “How do you do?” When
her husband said they would go to the Went-
worth for tea, she was more than ever con-
vinced that the fortune-teller was a witch.
The trio sat down at,a table, and before long
Mrs. Marsden, succumbing to the charm of
Miss Heath, almost forgot her annoyance
and jealousy. Her husband merely talked
business with Miss Heath, who from time
to time politely referred to Mrs. Marsden
for approval of plans she promulgated. And
when Mr. Marsden said that he Would be
working back at the office that night, and
suggested that Miss Heath spend the even-
ing with Mrs. Marsden and regale her with
the latest Paris fashions, she Was quite
agreeable.
Miss Heath, the daughter of an Anglican
clergyman, was born and bred in Paris, and
having just come from the gay city, was able
to give Mrs. Marsden interesting fashion
notes.
Before long, however, the eternal feminine
asserted itself, and Mrs. Marsden wondered
why Miss Heath, with her charm and beauty,
baa never married. She told Mrs. Marsden
that the only man she ever loved was killed
on active service.
From this they talked of rejuvenescence,
the subject ever Uppermost in the mind of
the woman who has passed her first youth.
“If only I could reduce myself,” sighed
Mrs. Marsden.
“You can, easily,”
“Oh, of course, the French know the secret
(*l remaining beautiful, practically for ever.”
"What I take to keep my figure slim is no
secret, Mrs. Marsden.”
“My dear, I shouldn’t have thought you
needed to take anything”
“Indeed, I do; or I would soon fall into
flesh. Directly I find myself putting on
weight, I just get a package of clynol berries,
and take one after each meal.”
“Do they affect the heart?”
“Oh, dear, no; the most delicate person
can take them with safety.”
“I shall certainly take them, and I won-
der, Heath, if you know of a good face
cream that doesn’t grow hairs.”
“Indeed, I do; and I’m most grateful to
the manufacturers for what it has done for
me. I never use anything but mercolized
wax. It is similar to the preparation used
by the famous French beauty Ninon
D’Enelos, who at sixty had the complexion
of a child.”
“How very fortunate T met you. Miss
Heath; I shall certainly add mercolized wax
to the list of things I want from the chemist.
Do you know I’m rather distressed about
my hair ; it’s greying fast, and my husband
suggests that I dye it, but I hate the very
thought of dye.”
“I can assure you, Mrs. Marsden, there’s
no necessity to use dye. When I lost my
fiance my hair began greying fast, but I used
Tammalite, and now you won’t find a grey
hair in my head —it simply worked wonders.
It’s quite simple to use. You just get two
ounces of concentrate of tammalite, and mix
it with three ounces of may rum. Apply to
the scalp at night with a small sponge until
the hair has gone back to its original color.”
“Thank you very much for the informa-
tion. May I ask what soap you use, Miss
Heath?”
“Certainly, I never use anything but
Pilenta”
“It’s awfully good of you, to be at such
pains to tell me about these delightful pre-
parations.”
“Not at all; I think it’s a woman’s duty
to contribute to the beauty of the world,
and if you will notice, a woman who takes
pains with herself has that elusive some-
thing that is so fascinating. But it’s tirqe
I was going.”
“I will send you home in the car. * You
have given me fresh courage in life. I’m
now bent on cultivating that elusive some-
thing.”

Corsets Specially Designed For YOU
GOSSARD Corsets are not designed like
other corsets. Gossard artists have
thought of you as belonging to one of the
nine ideal figure groups into which they
have divided all women. Special models
have been created for your particular fig-
ure needs—differently proportioned cor-
sets, differently boned corsets that will give
you just the support you need at your age
andyour weight to comfortably coax you
to the ideal proportions of your type.
A Gossard Corset designed for your very
own selfX'S, going to feel more comfortable
than you thought a corset could. It’s going
to meet you everywhere, with a steady,
uniform muscular support, but it isn’t
going to constrict or pinch you anywhere.
The whole idea of Gossard Type Cor-
cetry is to bring you to graceful propor-
tions, one curve growing out of another
with no part unduly emphasized. When
this is done you will have an appearance
of slimness that the woman with a four-inch
smaller waist and your own hip measure-
ments can never have. A faithful follow-
ing of this simple rule will alone take
pounds and pounds away from a woman's
apparent silhouette and years away from
her apparent age.
Be honest with yourself: —are you com-
pletely satisfied with both the appearance
and comfort of the corset you are now
wearing? Or does it cut into your limbs, or
push up the bust when you are seated, or
cause an awkward, unbecoming bulge of
flesh under the shoulder blades and under
the arms, or do any of those many irritat-
ing things that the wrong corset can do to
hurt you and tire you out and make you
look years older than you really are?
When you can purchase a gentlewoman’s
corset for as little Cost as, the ordinary kind,
an exactly-right Gossard will make the

most ot your natural beauty, will protect
your health, will be comfortable every
minute you have it on, will wash beau-
tifully and outwear two or even three ord-
inary corsets?
Go to the Best Store You Know
The stores selling Gossard Corsets take
pride in their service. You will be fitted by
an expert corsetiere who knows figure types
as well as corsets and who will assume full
responsibility for your satisfaction.
Gossard Brassieres
Gossard Brassieres, like Gossard Cor-
sets, are designed for the needs of the
nine figure groups. The new Longerlyne
models are priceless to the woman who
heretofore has been unable to find bras-
sieres with special shaping to support and
flatten the diaphragm and with extra
length to prevent them from slipping up
over the lower tops of the modern corsets.
Yet they are most reasonably priced
within the reach of every purse.

To-night (Thursday) Amy Castles gives
the last of three concerts at Melbourne Town
Hall. When one thinks of imported artists
who sometimes let off inferior fireworks at
a fancy price in that same building, it is but
fair and right to urge public support for
Australia’s most considerable resident singer.
Amy Castles is not “another Melba,” but
she is herself and a mighty fine and
honest prima donna. Since she last
sang here in opera her voice has
seemingly increased its generous volume
and gained by its concert experience. She
is most impressive in her biggest attempts.
In the air from Thomas’s “Hamlet” the note
of madness is hardly so thrilling as it might
be, nevertheless the vocalisation is first class,
and the artist may be said to challenge com-
parison. It is only in small things that Amy
Castles betrays the effects of singing to un-
cultivated audiences. Her treatment of a
Tom Moore melody or the tiresome “Home,
Sweet Home” is deadly slow, even to dirgi-
ness, the trouble with a large section of the
g.p. being that no popular ditty can be too
long drawn out. Eileen Castles is very
patchy in effect, her best patches being quite
charming. The solo pianist, Francis de
Bourguinon, is a clever performer who falls
short of expectation in “The Ride of the
Valkyrie,” and a harp accompaniment to
some of Amy Castles’s numbers brings the
accomplished Barker to the platform ’twixt
his solo items. Barker is not a totally blind
harpist these days, but his eyesight is very
limited, and his long grey locks help make
him a picturesque figure.
Memories of Tittell Brune are revived by
the resurrection of “Sunday” at Melbourne
Playhouse. Tittell was a gusty heroine,
conspicuous in her pretence of girlish charm.
The newcomer, Nellie Bramley, is more mat-
ter-of-fact, utters “Damn!” with conviction
and finality, and only fails here and there
in the later acts to maintain the standard of
her opening scene. Leslie Woods is the
wicked wheedler who tries to make Sunday
behave like a Saturday night. He isn’t an
especially provocative scoundrel; but his
glistening leggings and rakish riding pants
make him absolutely lifelike from the waist
down. Charles Lawrence’s noble counten-
ance' peeps from an undergrowth of whiskers
in the part of Davy, and Victor Fitzherbert
delivers Towzer’s sentiments over a goatee
that doesn’t look at home. However, Fitz-
herbert is a lusty and well-spoken sentinel
for Sunday, and George Hewlett is a force-
ful Jaclcy, whose physiognomy was palpably
created to double the terror of a threatening
gun. Arthur Cornell shrinks his voice down
THE ROYAL SOUTHERN SINGERS
AT MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
to the dimensions required for Lively, and
his business with the tome of medical advice
in his effort to diagnose Jacky’s trouble is in
keeping with his appearance of pathetic in-
terest in the case. Colonel Brinthorpe is
indebted to Guy Hastings for a precious bed-
side manner and a voice suitable for calling
the faithful to prayer. Nellie Calvin, whom
the present commentator hasn’t seen since
she appeared with Thomas Kingston in
“Brewster’s Millions,” is hereby welcomed
back as Mrs. Naresby. Austin Milroy is
inclined to be ornate as Tom Oxley, and
Ethel Bashford speaks a piece as Sister
Agatha. The show is pretty well mounted,
and had a big house for the opening of the
season on Saturday.

“Chu Chin Chow” did not eventuate at
Melbourne Majesty’s last week, as was pre-
dicted. But, unless the advt. has made
another mistake, the famous spectacle is on
view now.
“The O’Brien Girl,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, continues to be everything it was Dst
Boxing Night and something more. The
lively show has now no enemy except its
reputation, which is a hard thing to live up
to in the estimation of newcomers who are
seeing for the first time what there has been
so much talk about.
At Melbourne King’s the great mystery of
“Ambrose Applejohn’s Adventure” remains
unsolved. Did Ambrose really have an uncle
in the pirate trade who left a hidden trea-
sure in a secret cupboaid ; was the treasure
concealed in small sacks ; and if the one sack
that Poppy inquires into c ; 1 really contain
pearls instead of tapioca, why did her uncle
forget to open the other sacks or show rea-
sonable concern about his new-found wealth?
The city pauses for a reply.
“A Southern Maid” is always making
musical friends at Melbourne Royal, and
Oscar Asche’s careful production of the
opera still includes real wine the
stage refreshments. Anyhow, Todo, Fran-
cesco and Wex have been observed to smack
their lips after broaching a new bottle, and
the interests of art rarely inspire old stage
campaigners to smack their lips in a merely
supposititious cause.

Melbourne Tivoli has passed a quiet life
of late. Another comedy sketch by Bradley
and Hamilton, plus Arthur Greenaway, is
a recent change of bill; likewise an innocu-
ous dualogue by McNaughton and Sweet.
An exploiter of trained pigeons has an in-
tensely friendly personality which lends im-
portance to the pigeons, and the Royal
Southern Singers are pale-faced coons whose
concerted songs are largely a matter of liow
they strike the ear. Some ears will com-
plain that there is more sound than sweet-
ness in some of the Southern Songing.

The screen’s infant phenomenon, Wesley
Barry, is at Melbourne Majestic this week.
As an adventurous kid who deserts his dot-
ing parents for a gorgeous life with a burg-
lar, he pictures the secret thoughts of mil-
lions of other nippers of a like style and am
bition. Tom Moore in “Beating the Game,”
which follows, proves once more that a Mayor's
chair may be the last refuge of a scoun-
drel. At Hoyt’s “Under Two Flags” enables
Priscilla Dean to reveal the absurdity of
her first name in the part of Cigarette. It
is a picturesque version of the old tale, but
the familiarity of its situations invites dis-
sent. Another of Hoyt’s screenings is “Room
and Board,” a tumultuous Irish romance
that grants the Distinguished Order of the
Spotlight to Constance Binney, whilst .the
strange tale of “The Face in the Fog” gives
Lionel Barrymore the freedom of nearly a
mile of film. “Monte Cristo” is a feast of
caviare and cocktails to the enchanted chil-
dren of all ages at the Melba. The Bri-
tannia has “The Sheik’s Wife,” with the
camera always handy for the Psychological
Moment.

A Melbourne variety show: —
W. M. Whitney, the latest painter to appear at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum,' has not jet mastered the difficult
art of water-color. He hangs sundry little things which
try to express the charm that can only be obtained
by self-criticism and experience, and he is here
and there guilty of absolute discordancies that
a more highly-trained eye might consider unworthy
of exhibition. There is his “Autumn, Nepean
River,” for instance, which is an example of the
rainbow-school; and his “Blue Mountain Sketch,”
emphasising the rusty, brown tones which he employs
depressingly in some Sydney Harbor scenes, is an
almost doleful achievement. Yet, with all thia
evidence against him, the artist shows that he is
capable of good things. His “Middle Harbor, Sydney”
(No. 9), is such an arresting example of harmonious
painting in comparison with some of the others
that it might be the work of another hand. Then
in “Nocturne” he has cleverly caught the color
of a pool in twilight, and produced in “Winter
Morning” a very pleasing representation of a grey
day in the bush. These stand out like macaroons
in a spread of dog biscuits, and seem to promise
a much better general performance 12 months hence.

A Sundry Showman gets excited: —
Australia’s finest theatre was built in 17 i minutes
by two men and a toy. With a dozen or two clothes
props, some hessian and a few bits of string they
ran up the outer walls. Providence supplied the
roof —the sapphire dome of vaulted heaven which,
incidentally, made the glittering canopy of the
ravished tomb at Luxor look as cheap as a rag-
basket. The stage was merely an acre of gleaming
sand; the scenic effects the illimitable sea, the
great curling breakers of the Pacific fading away
to purling runnels of foam that lovingly caressed
the beauteous legs of the chorus. The whole out-
fit may have cost as much as Oscar Asche pays
for dinner; yet upon that simple stage was pre-
sented drama so vivid, full of action, intense in
interest and delightfully poetic in suggestion as to
thrill and exalt the audience. Here at last the
genius of Australia was given expression, and the
theatre had again, after the lapse of insipid ages,
become the home of a potent art, the magical reflex
of a nation’s spirit. And because of this, because
into that splendid theatre nastiness had never entered,
and because it felt a new joy in its soul, the
audience went away exalted. It was at Manly, where
the Dago restaurants are. Happily a smell of fried
onion was not suffered to defile the in
which this renaissance of the drama had birth. The
gentle nor’-east trade swept all such outrage away.
Still, there was something reminiscent of Sopho-
cles and Euripides about it all. When squads of
brown, half-naked athletes preceded by standard-
bearers swept on to the stage and were marshalled
into rank, the mind ran back to Athens in her days
of greatest dignity. How different this from the
tinpot theatre of a commercialised, degenerate art,
where, under artificial light, mediocrity amuses the
mediocre in queer clothes! As a race are Aus-
tralians going to be as far removed from Athenians
as from Cockneys? One wondered as clean-limbed,
lithe youth with the torso of Agamemnon donned
a lifebelt, and, bounding into the boiling surf,
swam with long, powerful strokes to rescue some
fictional heroine in distress. And when half-a-dozen
crews sprang into as many whaleboats drawn up
on the sand, and, with a statuesque figure aft at
and steer-oar, tense as a casting in bronze,
pushed off into the Pacific and wrestled on their
turbulent voyage to a distant buoy, the ridiculous
make-believe of Crummies and all his tribe was
knocked to blithering blazes. Yes, it was a great
play that the life-saving clubs staged at Manly.
“The Flaw” sustains its emotional appeal
at Sydney Criterion, leaving a trail, so to
speak, of quick intakes of breath and sus-
pended heart-beats in its foaming wake.

“Sally” is in her ninth week of heart-win-
ning at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, nor is there
any noticeable abatement in the glad lure
and pleasant witchery of Josie Melville.
The sadness of farewell to Louis Benni-
son, at Sydney Theatre Royal, is being pro-
tracted or staved off by a four-night revival
of “Johnny Get Your Gun.” Attractive
Marjorie Bennett is bidding au revoir to
her admirers in the same piece.

Wirths’ Circus fills and dazzles the eye, in
the intervals of taking away the breath, at
Sydney Hippodrome. The brute creation is
generously represented, with giddy elephants
at one end of the scale and stately geese at
the other, and every zoological exhibit fit
as a fiddle and trained to a T. Captain
Eapf, with his troupe of lions and bears,
would make Tarzan look ordinary. And
the acrobatic-CMm-eurhythmic talent of the
merely human performers is an in
wholesome joys. The Lloyds and the War-
tons, from trapeze or springboard, are fliers
whose like has never gladdened Australian
eyes before, and the swimming and diving is
another entrancing feature of the show.

Wedlock sails rough seas before it reaches

Russian Crown jewels are the bone of con-
tention, and Grand Duchesses, Bolshevik
spies and a reformed crook supply the ex-
citement. The Piccadilly refuses admittance
to children to view a screen version of Oscar
Wilde’s “Woman of no Importance”; and
the nod is expected to be as good as a wink
to the rest of the population. But it will
have to take its own muck with it, if that’s
what it wants. Among the old-timers there
is a strenuous race. “Manslaughter” is in
its fourth week at the Globe, “Blood an!

and “Dream Street” is still in the same
place at the Crystal Palace. But the street
will be torn up next Saturday to make way
for Mary Pickford in “Tess of the Storm

Adelaide has come at Shakspeare with a
vigor that maintains the reputation of the
city for encouraging the best in drama. Allan
Wilkie has got the Prince of Wales’s literal y
packed. Comedy is the bill so far, “Mid-
summer Night” and “Twelfth Night,” with
the humorous side of each accented. The
Royal is reopening with Gertrude Elliott
(who is the wife of Forbes Robertson) and
a “new complete English company” in a
ditto ditto play. Also, there continue as
before variety at the Majestic, open-air
shows at Austral Gardens and the Exhibi-
tion, where ,T. H. Wakefield is assisting for
a week, and good pictures, ranging from the
jolly to the sensational, at York, Wonder-
graph, West’s, Grand and Pav.
“Thorold”: They’ve written a musical
play, round Schubert, the composer, his
alleged girl and some others, and produced
it at Hammersmith, now the spiritual home
of the Cockney highbrow. In “Lilac Time’
the amiable and plain-featured Franz is in-
volved in the intrigues of a jealous count,
an Italian opera singer and a detective, and
is otherwise immersed in a love story much
at variance with the true one, which con-
sisted of a soulful but unexpressed yearning
for a countess of the Esterhazy clan. Our
old friend Courtice Pounds impersonates
Schubert, and Edmund Gwenn is the comic
parent of the wench the opera-manufac-
turers have forced him to love against his
will and in spite of history.
“Plasmon”: Walter Hackett, the author
of “Ambrose Applejohn’s Adventure,” now
brightening up the populace at Melbourne
King’s, was responsible with Roi Cooper
Megrue for the diverting “It Pays to Adver-
tise,” staged in Australia a few years back.
Hackett has a liking for collaboration. He
wrote “The White Sister” with the Italian-
ated Marion Crawford, and in the production
of “He Didn’t Want to Do It,” presented in
London in 1916, he had the help of George
11. Broadhurst, the father of “What Hap;
pened to Jones,” “Why Smith Left Home
and “Bought and Paid For.” 11. A. \ achell,
remembered here for “Quinney’s,” was ; H ac '
kett’s partner in “Mr. Jubilee Drax, an
ingenious little piece that has long since
joined the Great Forgotten.

“Winkle”: Had Asche started his Melb.
Shakspearean season with “Othello” or
“The Taming of the Shrew” he would have
done better business. Portia and Calpurnia
don’t give the women sufficient heart-throbs,
and drammer doesn’t go in Melbourne unless
Mrs. and Miss Suburbia tell all their friends
that it is simperly 10-o-vely. Another reason
for the lack of appreciation on which Oscar
descants so bitterly is that Lily Brayton is '
not in the company. The vogue of the pic-
ture-postcard had made this actress famous
before she came here, and she it was who
drew the dear creatures that buy p.p.c’s, so
much so that they used to gather at the
Royal before sundown. Only once did I

hear Miss _ Brayton criticised by a woman.
One evening, after the smothering in
“Othello,” a Collingwood lady—obviously
out of place in the stalls —spoke derisively
to the sobbing tabbies around her. “If yer’il
cry fer this,” she scoffed, “whaddud yer do
if yer saw Eugenie Duggan in ‘The Chris-
tian’ ?”
“0.K.”: The redeeming characteristic of
Oscar Asche’s huge Marc Antony is his
honesty of utterance. He makes all the
other people sound like mummers, while he
talks with the easy assurance of an auc-
tioneer in the bosom of his family. Those
low notes of his carry conviction. He
doesn’t suggest the Marc of history. He
is the Antony of Oscar Asche, even as
Bernhardt was the Cleopatra of Divine
Sarah. Such interpretations are simply a law
unto themselves. Asche’s r.ch voice rings
true to the dominating personality of the
powerful man. He makes an Antony to
suit himself, as of old he made a
Shyloek to suit himself, and when that per-
suasive Asche is on the stage you are inter-
ested in every word he says. When he talks
one thinks of the silent puppets of the movies
as poor ghostly frauds. The supreme quali-
fication for natural acting is honesty of
utterance —in which, by-the-way, Lily Bray-
ton was always so lacking.
“Orb”: Apropos of “The Man Who Ate
the Popomaclc” (B. l/3/’23), Asche delights
to burn joss-sticks or something “off” to call
up the “spicy garlic smells” of Araby. And
Alfred Dampier used to fry bacon in the
orchestra to give the matutinal atmosphere
of the Marsdens’ hut in “Robbery Under
Arms.” But why not carry the idea further?
“Ten Nights in a Bar-room” would be more
realistic if the auditorium was sprayed with
the real Mackay rum before the early doors
were opened. To make the offence really
smell to Heaven, a fistful of bonedust might
be employed in the graveyard scene in “Ham-
let.” And if full-flavored drama is wanted,
why not harrow the feelings of the audi-
ence with a whiff of iodoform in the hospital
scene? Some of these plays are badly in
need of disinfectants and antiseptics, any-
how.
“The Mug”: How much longer are the
film-censors going to tolerate this Sheik stuff?
It is bad enough to teach the silly young
female of the species, per medium of foreign
pitchers, that it is her natural destiny to
be an over-sexed and under-dressed loafer,
forever maundering about her “soul,” but
when miscegenation is glorified in the propa-
ganda it is time somebody intervened with
an axe. In a horror titled “The Sheik’s
Wife,” now touring the Sydney subbubs, one
of the verminous niggers miscalled Arabs is
shown fondling his English blonde in the
bridal section of the tribal caravanserai.
After an estrangement, due to the advent of
a second lady, the beast is pictured, with sick-
ening realism, mauling her about again. In the
closing spasm the gloating savage divides his
loathsome endearments between the woman
who has abandoned her race, with its morn-
ing-tub traditions, and their half-caste brat.
How docs this poisonous rubbish get past the
censor?
“Tren” : That Harry Julius sketch of Bill
McQuade in “Possum Paddock” (B.
22/2/’23) came like a smack in the eye to
Melbourne Shakspearean cranks, for it was
their first intimation that Fred McDonald
had gone back to melofarce. Fred’s Dave
in “On Our Selection” is, of course, un-
approachable, but the good work he did for
Allan Wilkie as Sir Toby Belch in “Twelfth
Night.” Casea in “Julius Caesar,” the Porter
in “Macbeth,” the Gravedigger in “Hamlet”
'and Gratiano in “The Merchant of Venice”
endeared him to Melbourne audiences. “Pos-
sum Paddock,” of course, is good in its way,
but Shakspeare is a shade better.
“H.E.R.”: The Queen’s Hall, Perth, has
been the home of various entertainments,
from Melba concerts to educated-ape acts,
with a few years of continuous pictures
thrown in. About 12 months ago, after a
big city fire, it was converted into an im-
promptu ragshop, but is again open for legi-
timate business. The hall is owned by the
Methodists, one of whom, the Rev. G. E.
Rowe, used to run flourishing after-church
stunts. Rowe had a neat turn for effect.
He did not associate darkness with Satanic
influence. All the lights would be switched
off, and a magic lantern brought into service,
the words of the hymn to be sung being pro-
jected on the white walls. One night “Shall
We Gather at the River” was so treated.
At that period a Rickards co. was showing
at the Royal, and one of the com : c men
used to sing a plaintive Cockney parody on
the hymn. Imagine the surprise of the Rev.
Rowe when the subjoined interrogation was
beefed out by 75 per cent, of the audience: —
Anybody seen me brother Charlie —
Charlie —arlie —arlie —arlie —
Anybody seen me brother Charlie,
Him with the big pot of beer?
“.Tacky Roo” : It has been my proud privi-
lege to welcome “Snowy” Baker’s return to
the films. In a thing called “Doubling Romeo,”
recently released in London, “Snowy”
figures in a mob of cowboys, whose sole work
is to clan the hero enthusiastically on the
back. “Snowy” is an excellent fellow, and
has done Australia some service in a sport-
ing sense. But he has an unscrupulous
enemy—the man who told him he could act.
“Pedro”: “If Shakspeare wrote ‘Hamlet’
would he not have taken the part himself?”
argues “Donalbain” (B. l/3/’23). Shagsner
was no actor to play Hamlet or any other
big part. Apart from that, “Donalbain”
overlooks the profound argument that Shax-
per played the Ghost because thereby he
was enabled to get in front and keep an eye
on the box-ofßce. people at the receipt of
custom.
“Dido”: Reminded by the bold deed of a
Shakspearean actor in Melbourne, who dashed
out and stopped a runaway horse, I want to
tell of the splendid heroism of my friend
Wood, who has been saving heroines by flood
and field for years. Going home one even-
ing, Wood came upon a vociferous crowd
outside a burning cottage. The brigade had
not yet arrived. Taking a place in the
bright light, the actor-r-r threw off his coat
and rolled up his sleeves, just as he did
when salving Marie from the raging torrent
in "No Man’s Friend,” and dashed into the
blazing dwelling. He was gone two or
three minutes, and returned, blackened and
smoked, with his eyebrows removed. “She
is not there,” he said in faltering tones.
“No, yell blank id jit,” came a cruel voice
from the crowd. “It’s a hempty house.”
“Niinshi”: Harry Benham (B. 22/2/’23)
was a good Pooh Bah, but I prefer Fred
Billington to all I have seen in the part,
Rutland Barrington included. Billmgton’s
rendering of “My Family Pride is Some-
thing lngonzeivable” was a model of
unctuous delivery. He was equally a win-
ner in Shadbolt.
“Nero”: “Lex” (B. l/3/’23) overlooks the
fact that the man killed in “The Flaw” was
in the act of burghng Frank Harvey’s safe
when he was shot. Thus Harvey
coukl plead justifiable homicide or death
by misadventure, claiming in the latter case
that he only fired to frighten the midnight
robber. The matter would not have gone
beyond the Coroner’s inquest. There is
really no necessity for the sleep-walking
scene, but of course without it there would
have been no play nor six weeks’ “capacity”
business. Anyhow, the idea is as old as the
hills. I dropped across it 40 years ago, in
a piece of Palgrave Simpson’s called “Time
and the Hour.” In that play, however, it
was the “heavy,” not the hero, who walked
in his sleep, and thus proved to everybody’s
satisfaction that he was guilty of the mur-
der, which had happened off-stage in the
first act.
“The Deacon”: “Lou’s” yarn(B. l/3/’22)
of a lightning vaudeville co_. recalls an ex-
perience of the Fisk Jubilee Singers in
Emerald IQ.). It was electioneering time,
Harry Muller, yen.
manager of the
various Fuller theatri-
cal interests in
Melbourne.
and by some mis-
take the only hall
had been let
to both Joey Bell
and the meiodists.
After argument it
was arranged that
Joey should occupy
the hall till 9.30
p.m., and that the
Fisks should then
come on. It was
a blistering cold
night on those
Central Queens-
land plains, and
the poor coons sat
round waiting for
the hot-air artists
to subside. About
10 p.m. they sub-
sided, but despite
Joey's urgent ap-
peal to the crowd
to be sports and
w r ait for the con-
cert, they nearly
all followed him to
the comforts of
free drinks. Only
a dozen or so re-
mained to listen to
old-man White
(lately dead in
Sydney),- Belle
Gibbons and others
keep it going in
that perishing cor-
rugated-iron hall
till after midnight. And then the luckless
Ethiopians had to “hit the rattler” at 3.30
a.m. on a 15-hour run to Longreach.
“S.T.S.”: That par. about the abandon-
ment of the pipe-organ in the Melbourne
Exhibition (B. 15/2/’23) sent me thinking
about the Christmas of 1880, when that
Exhibition was a new thing, and my first
visit to Melbourne. There was a pantomime
with the three Stewart sisters in it. There
was another mainly by children, but includ-
ing Thorne and Mrs. Lewis. The school-
room scene went merrily, with Thorne as
the Bad Boy. “What is the organ of
speech?” he was asked in class. “Gaunson’s
tongue.” “Then what is the organ of
silence?” “The Exhibition organ!”’ Yells
from the audience, during which it had to be
explained to the visitor that Gaunson was
a noted advocate, and that the big new
music-box at the Exhibition was generally
out of order and therefore dumb. Only one
other detail sticks in the mind from that
panto.—a pun, in the manner of the period,
on a player’s real name. Said the Bad Boy
to the Good Fairy:—
Forgive me, fairy, for you have the power,
And I won’t go and do it Annie Mauer.
“Pedro”: Kate Ilowarde, who has been
long on the road in Australia, and now be-
comes a personality by virtue of the success
of “Possum Paddock,” is a Maorilander, and
long ago figured in a juvenile troupe of
which the late Charles Marter, of Sydney
D.T., was a member —the D’Ortelle company.
Her sister married Robert Vernon, brother
of Howard.
“POSSUM PADDOCK,” AT SYDNEY
OPERA HOUSE.
Bobby McQuade (Felix Bland).
“Whitebait”: W. Cronin Wilson, who is
to shine with Lady Forbes-Robertson (Ger-
trude Elliott) in several plays for the Firm,
made a hit in London in “The Bird of Para-
dise” three years back as the degraded youth
whom Louis Kimball presented here later.
Wilson used to be a member of the late
Lewis Waller’s companies, and was a useful
man in “Monsieur Beaucaire” and other
plays in which Waller sparkled. He went
to America in 1912 to play in “Milestones,”
and there became acquainted with Eugene
Walter, the author of “Paid in Full,” “The
Easiest Way” and other gaspers that have
been staged in the Commonwealth. The two
collaborated in “Nancy Lee” and “The
Small-town Girl,” pieces that never added
much to the lustre of their authors.
“Vandorian”: There was a shrewd com-
ment in the Woman’s Letter the other week
to the effect that Lady Di. Manners is not
so beautiful as society pars, lead us to expect.
She isn’t. I saw her at a big charity
bazaar in the Royal Albert Hall (London),
where there was a huge concourse of Brit-
ish and Australian good-lookers. In the crush
Lady I)i., who was helping, was nowhere
as a beauty. But she has sparkling dark
eyes, a thin-featured face, and the air of being
something out of the common. It was a
blow to think I had been standing beside
her, and never noticed that she was a beauty.
Her clothes are even in these days of fancy
dress remarkable and bizarre, and her
ways en suite. Mr. Duff Cooper seems to
have a proper sense of his own unimportance)
and is usually merely in attendance, as an
untitled person who married a Duke’s
daughter. Every other society paper in Lon-r
don apologised when the Duff Cooper paiij
took a small house in Bloomsbury-square)
and blamed the war and the house-shortage
for bringing the peerage down to that.
Lavery painted Lady Di. in bed, with won-
derful daffodil frillies, when she was con-
valescing- after an accident that gave her a
broken leg. At least, everyone said it was
a portrait of the lively young woman.
“Wilfrido”: The Annette Kellerman film,
M.L.’s first big pitcher, has been completed
at last. The Massey Government lent the
s.s. Hinemoa for some of the scenes in the
Sounds, Nelson and Wellington Harbor, and
at Taka.ka, the M.L. counterpart of Tir-
ranna, where the picnic races are held, the
co. erected a village. Nearly all the actors,
the electricians and the photographers are
Yanks. Annette herself, when asked whether
she was going back to Los Angeles, replied
“Sure, kid !”
“T.W.”: Ward prides himself on being aii
innovator, but he is not to be compared in
that respect with D’Oyly Carte, inventor of
queues and other improvements. The first
queue formed up when Carte transferred
“Patience” from the Opera Comique to the
Savoy, and the man who backed Gilbert and
Sullivan got his wife to send out tea and
cakes to keep the waiting folk in a docile
mood. That same run of “Patience” saw
the first replacement of gas-flare footlights
by electric bulbs. Carte likewise introduced
free programmes and banned gratuities.
Others had to follow him in all four leads,
but they soon got back to the bad old tipping
habit and the thrip’ny programme.
MAUD FANE DEPARTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Maud Fane, everybody’s favorite, is about to
retire from the stage. She and her sailor husband
intend to go in for mixed farming in Surrey (Eng.).”
Eggs will be fresh, milk admirably creamy,
And the soft climate will give added charm ;
In that old county, dim, religious, dreamy,
How will Maud run her farm ?
Ah, she embarks —she leaves our small world dreary ;
Beauty was in her every pout and bow;
Casting her pearls so long to— Did she weary?
She will have pollard now.
She could bewitch us lightly without talking,
With her strange wealth of Eve’s eternal guile;
Even those pigs unto the market walking
Will give her smile for smile.
As she the Rouen or the Pekin chases
Will she in dream, perhaps, come back once more?
Hear the applause of far outlandish places,
The footbeats on the floor?
Will she, supremely gowned in blue delicious,
Keep the young turkeys from all kinds of harm?
And we shall hope no gobbler old and vicious
Defies her on her farm.
While she the lanky gosling coaxes, quickens,
And the spring onion speaks to all the land,
Will she, amid the cheeping of the chickens,
Our worship understand?
Will she, a woman wise, a quick creator
Of gladsome roles, an artist rightly called—
Will she, while tending the fierce incubator,
See that no chickens scald ?
Jokes to the side, she came smiling demurely ;
To a dull world she gave a gladdening mind;
Spring was upon her, and sweet wisdom surely—
A woman summer-kind.
Farewell she says to artifice and hurry;
In the Most Serious Drama now she plays.
May she, in that old calm, salubrious Surrey,
Meet with the happy days!
Victoria.

Goldsborough Mort and Co. Ltd., Sydney.
We have much pleasure in informing you that the
“Comet" Windmills you have supplied and erected
for us, during the past twelve years, on our various
properties in Queensland and New South Wales,
have given complete satisfaction. They are working
at depths from 50 to 400 feet. They work in the
lightest wind and will stand the heaviest storms.
We can confidently recommend your Mills as the
best we are acquainted with, for watering either
6)mall or large numbers of stock.
(Signed) KEN Lu CUDMORE, Mgr.
IT is only after severe and prolonged
trial and test that such a huge
organisation as Goldsborough Mort
and Co. pin their faith to any make of
equipment.
The “Comet” Windmill has won their
first choice because of its all-round
superiority in all weathers, its freedom
from breakdown trouble and repair cost,
and its greater pumping capacity.
There are reasons for this supremacy.
Investigate them for your own benefit. Here
are but a few of the features back of our
three years guarantee, and responsible for
the superior performance of “Comet” Mills
in transforming wind power to water
supply.
STRUCTURAL STRENGTH—onIy best
qualitj materials in a “Comet.” LARGE
BE ARa <GS—running in continuous oil
bath, practically eliminating friction and
wear. LARGE DIAMETER SHAFT—
—ROLLER GUIDES- “SET” OF SAILS
—perfected after trying every conceivable
type and angle of sail, to give maximum
pumping power in the lighter winds.
SPECIAL SPRING GOVERNOR—to pre-
vent racing and damage in high winds.

marks are all over them. . . .Wafin: Rather an ancient
theme; and not quite well enough done. . . .P.8.P.;
The hunting hound, the cider-press, the falling leaves
and acorns and the play of the squirrel are not
marked features of the Australian autumn. Won't
your poetic eye see anything less than 10,000 miles
distant ?... .Mary G.: Very lame in its ideas and
phrases. .. .J.M.N.: The violence spoils it. Those
things don’t happen. .. .N.M. (Christchurch): Doesn’t
quite carry itself. . . .Atticus: It moves nicely enough,
but there is no new thought.... Waffles: You can
“laugh at the albatross” if you like; but don’t
you think the albatross might laugh to see you
“dance through the cliff’s cold caves” ?.... The
i* Chamois: That idea was worth while, but it needed
brighter handling and more care. . . . A.F.L. : Not for
us. . . .Wally W.: All far too crude. . . .E.M.T.: Dread-
ful rubbish. . . .J. 5.8.: You don’t get all the thrill

That-story, bright lady, was written by one of the
best Australian writers; but your method of re-
hashing it is all your own: —-
To his girl he said, “Will you excuse me a mo?”
Then with staggering steps he made for the Lavo;
He vowed he would lose every one of those ants.
So right on the spot he was off with his pants ;
Straight to the window he went with speed,
To the ant-bites on him he paid no heed.
In the evening breeze his pants did sway,
And I’m sure he had some swearing to say,
When a train that was coming the opposite way
Caught them and carried them right away,
But a kindly port on the station was there,
Who lent him a pair of dungarees to wear.
T his poor young man lived out at Rose Bay,
lie hadn’t enough money for a taxi to. pay,
And the people of Sydney did laugh and stare,
For his suspenders were, showing and his knees, were
bare.
I’m sure he will always remember the day,
When the train took his anty-pants away.
. ...H.L.W.: The same old thing in the same old
way. . . .N.J.M.: Alternately graceful and clumsy. .. .
J.8.F.: Not for this market.... Ronald B.: An an-
cient yarn without freshness in the telling. .. .
J.D.C.: Too long and broken. ... M.C.D.: Starts
moderately well and goes to pieces. .. .J.J.M.: Pretty
shocking... .Fer,shaw, Chordelia, F.J.W. and M.G.M.:
Not up. . . .P.Y.E.: Yes to all the questions. But rhe
outstanding feature of the verse is your rhyming
“east” with “west.” “Pears” on the same prin-
ciple should rhyme with “apples,” and possibly
“pubs” with “thirst”... .E.C.11.: Falls down in
places, as when you try to rhyme “crushed” with
“just”... .M.F.G.: You’ll have to do better than
that. .. .Ethel W.: An unpleasant idea in poor
verse....No Signature: “Life’s Yesterday” fails all
the way from 1 a.m C.J.8.: You leave too many
lines kicking their heels in the air.. . .A.P.R.: A
bit rocky. .. . R.D.F.: Hardly. . . .F.N.W.: “The
Golden Voice” doesn’t get anywhere. ... G.W.W.:

’Minds me of the cattle-
Bells that rested me from worry.

don’t make as much of it as you might. .. .A.R.G.:
Very crude and lumpy A. Shock: Terrifying verse
without point or humor. ...A.E.E.: Delightful domes-
tic picture disturbed by shocking verse... .A.J.L.:
None of them get near. . . .M.8.P.: Sorry, but it
misses... .R.F.G.: The same idea has been worked
far better. .. .R.D. (Dungog) : “Yellow” is an impos-
sible rhyme for “low.” And cut out the “thy” and
the “methinks”....Pip Tok: Not quite... .W.S.T.:
Too weak and easy. .. .Deirdre: “Triolet” no use....
M.A.R.: The “paper rose” idea is too difficult for
you. ... A.G.M.: The examples quoted as worth while
are the sort of “anthems” Australia might pray to
be delivered from... .Wilf: Slight things like these
must be done without jolting lines and false rhymes.
... .Rustyface: You don’t improve a well-shorn
theme by using cheap Americanisms to express your
feelings for home on the Darling. ...Sapere A.: An
intoxicated person in Melbourne got more intoxicated
in the company of Jack London and heard him
wheeze off an ancient jest the next day. Well, well!
....Rilda G.: The verse is very rickety... .R.F.G.:
They don’t even get near enough to say “How do?”

operation on his ear, and maybe on his soul as well.

for a little more elbow-grease. ... J.-M.F.: Is~it a
riddle?. .. .Fen W,: Falls just outside the line....

greatly improved it. .. .Artemus H.: Get rid of a few
jolts that you’ve dropped in for the sake of easy rhymes
and “Battalions” will pass. .. .1.H.5.: There’s a

£Messrs. ‘B eale & Co. Ltd.,
It is impossible to express in mere r words my ap-
preciation of your wonderful reproducing piano.
As I listen to the rolls played by such great artists
as c ßusoni, Levitski, Greig, and others whom I
have had the honour of meeting and hearing, I
close my eyes and imagine it is not a mechanical
reproducer I am listening to, but to the great per-
formers in flesh and blood, so faithfully is every
mannerism of technique, shall one say, photo-
graphed. c 'And the tone of the instrument is
unequalled by any I have heard.
Truly the Teale is, the final step, for it is a ioo
per cent, reflection 'of a pianist’s efforts.
Tours faithfulf
m -f
jO properly understand Mr. Asche’s letter
it is necessary to know that the New Beale
Reproducer is NOT a player-piano.
Every player-piano requires to be intelli-
gently controlled by an operator someone who will
give the music the depth of feeling it should have.
The Beale Reproducer requires no operator. It is
electrically controlled and, from special "recordings”
reproduces the playing of nearly every famous pian-
ist in the world. In touch, tone and temperament,
these recordings are exact reproductions of the pianists'
effects—hence the name "reproducer piano.”
Mr. Asche’s letter is doubly interesting from the fact that the
playing of many artists whom he has heard personally was faith-,
fully reproduced by this wonderful, new instrument

“S.C.”: Touching the preservation of
meat by the sulphur-dioxide process, this
treatment was tried somewhere about 18G6
by the late James Manning (brother of Wil-
liam, once N.S.W. Equity Judge) at Pam-
bula. Some of the products were shipped to
London, and are said to have opened up in
excellent condition. Beefsteaks were among
the articles preserved, and these are said
to have been exceptionally succulent, and
neither tainted nor toughened by the chemi
cal used.
“Ashmead”: Ivelsall and Kemp’s new
woollen mill at Invermay (Tas.) started its
machinery the other day. The first product
will be flannel, but all sorts of woollens will
follow. The other new woollen industry in
Launceston, Paton and Baldwins’, is fast
approaching completion. Already they have
a miniature plant set up to teach local girls
their future trade. The firm contemplates
providing its workers with a housing scheme
something on the lines of Cadbury’s and the
Electrolytic Zinc people’s at Eisdon.

“F.11.R.”: Re “E. Clinton’s’’ par. (B.
25/l/’23.) on breeding flowers. Isn’t there
more serious work awaiting science than try-
ing to improve the lovely flannel-flower or
boronia? If one of these pundits would
metamorphose the prickly-pear by crossing
it with the tomato (both grow wild in
Queensland) he might emblazon his name
on the scroll of fame for ever. An improved
flannel-flower would be a very pretty sight,
no doubt, but a commercial prickly-pear
would be the means o' turning millions of
acres of land, now valueless and a mere
source of expense, into good £ s. d.
* * * *
“Centre,” : Can anyone tell me what weight
of fruit, in pounds, an acre under bananas
should carry—plants, soil, conditions, etc.,
all being O.K.—in 12 months? I am asking
for the actual food weight. Also, does the
N.S.W. banana-grower get as big a return
as the man a thousand miles or so further
north? There’s a shifty-eyed indiv’dual
trying to. sell me a banana plantation some-
where this side of the border, which, accord-
ing to him, returns 250,0001 b. of actual
banana food per acre per annum. I haven’t
seen the place, nor do I believe him. So
far I have gathered, from outside informa-
tion. that bananas should yield 230,0001 b.
at the outside, but that I’d make more
money from murphies, which give a better
return with about 40001 b. food weight per
acre. What’s the strength of it?
“Gayndah”: Why does “Cleveland” (B.
l/2/’23) blame Theodore for the bungle over
ratoon cotton? The Lancashire people had
never made any comments as to the relative
merits of ratoon and plant cotton for spin-
ning purposes. It was their representatives,
the British delegation, who threw the belated
bomb that decided the issue. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture was always unfavorably
disposed towards ratooning, owing to the
danger of insect pests which this system
tends to encourage, and when the delegation
waxed emphatic as to what the spinners were
prepared to accept, the Government, in
the interests of a new industry, gladly
put the ban on ratooning. Anyhow, the
cotton industry, bright as the prospects are,
is only a sideline, and it's all bunkum to
say that Strawberry is being ousted to make
way for the new' crop. In this district, the
Australian home of cotton, no such thing
is happening. The few people who are
specialising in cotton are chiefly those who
have never grown pumpkins or helped to feed
Dennis in their lives.
* * * *
“Kip” : Reference has recently been made
to the introduction by the wily Japanese
pearl-fishers at Broome of glass beads as a
stimulant to pearl culture. The success
which has attended this experiment would
seem to contradict the modern theory that
the pearl is a disease not caused through
extraneous circumstances. The old belief
was that the oyster became irritated by any
foreign body finding a wav into its shell,
and in self-protection built up. through the
agency of its lips (which consist o' a vas-
cular membrane tapering to a filmy substance
at the outer edge), a smooth coating of pearl
around the unwelcome intruder. The sup-
porters of the modern theory deny this, and
claim that any foreign body coming’ into
contact with the lips of the oyster would
cause them to close. They state, also, that
it would be impossible for even so minute a
thing as a grain of sand to penetrate that
part of the shell in which the nearl is
usually found. Amid this conflict of op’n’on
one thing is certain—if a real pearl is nared
into the smallest of pieces no core different
from the pure composition of the pearl is
ever found.
THE PRESSMAN'S LOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Dedicated to Frank Ilen-ty after reading
‘‘The Farmer’s Lot.")
The pressman’s is a toilsome lot. He leaves m»
bed at noon,
Goes sternly forth to have a “spot” and rhapsodise
the moon.
With scissors, paste and fountain pen he climbs the
rungs of Fame ;
He satirises farmer-men, for that is in the game.
He ta)ks of “piffle,” “tripe” and “tosh,” of “my
own super-stuff” ;
He has no time for Keats’s “bosh”: of Wells he's
“had enough.”
He has a few more “spots” by now to lubr-Mc-cate
his brain ;
In point of fact, his classic brow exudes the
“spots” like rain.
At five g.m. he hastens home to dodge the duns
in town ;
He writes his great immortal “pome” and throws
the gauntlet down.
The farmer-man may be a clod, a Goth, a mate for
Turks,
••ut, by the great, exalted God, he pays his way
and works !
So, poets, ere you vilify the farmer-man again,
Go, take the mote from out your eye and brush
your mighty brain!
bow down before the farmer-man, a crude, iambic
dud,
\ “Bellerive” and an “Also Kan” —you couldn’t
grow a spud !

An 8-point lead for the Jlsreß Shear.
1. THE “LISTER” PATENT SELF-LEVELLING CROWN PLATE
—automatically ensures level tension, requires no hammering or screwing
in, as it simply drops into its seat, and, being glass-hard, toutwears ten
old-style crown plates. The principle of the “Lister” Grown Plate is
sure to be imitated, but only at the expense of simplicity.
2. THE SELF-SEATING LONG BUSH—first introduced by the “Lister”
and still a better and simpler fitting than its imitators, as, like the
crown plate, it simply drops into its seat and is held in place by screwing
up the tail-piece sleeve (4). Obviously mucli easier to fit than the old
separate bushes, and ensures perfect alignment. There is thus no
danger of over-heating or wear on the spindle.
3. OIL RECESSES IN LONG BUSH AND SPINDLE —act as a reservoir
for oil for the whole of the spindle and prevent the overheating caused
bv some styles of long bush.
4. RENEWABLE TAIL-PIECE SLEEVE —takes the wear of the swivel
half of the shear joint, and so makes the tail-piece everlasting. As it
is simply screwed on, it can be renewed in the shed.
5. ADJUSTABLE SPLIT LID-BUSH WITH LOCK RING —a strong,
hardened bush, which will outwear several old-style bushes and can be
adjusted to meet the variation in tension nuts. As a result, the tension
nut can be made hard and lasts years longer. Also the Expander and
Stock and Die are no longer required in the tool kit.
6. REINFORCED SPINDLE AT CRANK-HEAD SCREW. —Every
sheepman knows the weakness of the spindle where it is threaded for
the crank-head. The “Lister” Spindle, however, is made much larger in
diameter at this part, and all danger of breaking is eliminated.
7. OIL-RETURNING GROOVES.- —These grooves on the spindle prevent
leakage of oil from the shear body.
8. ADJUSTING SCREW. —While the shear joint is still of the well-
known screw less pattern, this screw has been added to the “Lister”
Joint so that any side play due to wear can be taken up quickly and
simply without the use of washers.
We have tried to prove to you—as well as we can in mere print—that the “Lister” meets the most exacting sheepman s require-
ments in a way no other machine can. Shearer, Expert and Shedowner alike find the “Lister” the most serviceable shear. It
not only shears quicker, closer and cooler than other machines, but, as we have just shown you, it gets out of order less and is
more easily and quickly put right again. Let uc discuss with you the bringing of your shed equipment right up to date.

A. B. Skottowe, just dead in Adelaide after
a long illness, was one of tlie Eastern Exten-
sion Telegraph Co.’s best-known men. After
the usual preliminary experience in India,
China, and elsewhere, he was for some years
superintendent in Sydney. Thence he went
to Singapore; but two years ago ill-health
forced a retirement.
“Te Babarantiko”: “Yardley” traces the
name of Melbourne to its source (B. 15/2/’23).
There are other places, of much more recent
christening, that may puzzle future philolo-
slSj\ Jfor instance, how many of the surfers
and holiday-makers invading Cronulla would
know—and care if they knew—that Ewos
I arade is concocted of the initials of the
name of E. W. O’Sullivan, bygone politician
and originator of Sydney Central Railway
station?
“Theolog”: When he was doing theology
at Ridley College (Melb.), R. G. Nichols
was a constant thorn in the flesh of Princi-
pal Aitken, who once in his wrath declared.
ioull never make good.” The young man’s
reply was, “I’ll show you !” He did. When he
went up ■to Fitzroy recently to put St.
Marks on the map (and, incidentally, cause
a stir in church circles by largely displacing
sermons with pictures), he went labelled
M.A., B.D. Dip. Ed., Th.L., and Inter.
B.Econ.Se. (Bond.) —with first-class honors
m everything.
“Henry Bateson”: As to when The Bul-
letin reaches the Rickety Isles (B. l/2/’23)
it all depends on what day the boat leaves
Sydney. If it is a Thursday, the red cover
hits Auckland on the Monday. With a ton
ot luck Wellington might be reached on the
Wednesday, but more frequently it is the
Thursday. Christchurch generally has to
wait until the Saturday morning. Dunedin
is able to buy it on the succeeding Monday,
while it ambles into Bluff a couple of days
later. But should the boat not leave Sydney
until the Saturday, delivery will be delayed
everywhere for at least two days and mostly
more. J
“M.P.”: The average man who votes for
h*abor knows his job, and is not led astray by
distracting issues. At the Adelaide Criminal
Court a trolly-driver was in the witness-box.
Do you remember December 16 last?” asked
counsel. “Yes,” replied the driver. “Have
, a 11 ~Pa f t ic u i ar reason for remembering
the day ? Yes, it was voting day.” “Vot-
ing day for what?” “For Labor.” “Yes, we
know that, but what elections were they?”
Ihe witness shrugged his shoulders and
frankly admitted his ignorance. “I don’t
take any interest in that," he admitted. The
laughter that followed was general, but the
witness seemed to think they were a crowd
easily amused.
“Schnorrer” from his ghetto:—
The screen story of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Bea-
consfield, due here shortly, will find plenty of the
Chosen eager to view it. For the fact remains that the
Jews are mightily proud of Britain’s one Hebraic
Prime Minister, albeit he was outside their religious
fold. For centuries the Portuguese Jews formed
a sort of aristocracy among the Children of Israel.
They claim clear descent from the House of Judah,
and political advantages in olden days gave them
a higher average of culture than other Hebrews.
Beaconsfield’s father was a prominent member of
the Portuguese Synagogue in London, and Disraeli
actually underwent his Barmitzvah (or confirmation)
there. But owing to a quarrel with the other elders,
Disraeli pere abandoned Juadism, joined the
Church of England, and had his son confirmed as
an Anglican. For all that, Dizzy retained his
Jewish friends all through life.
“Tin Hat”: Since the Victorian State
schools re-opened numbers of indignant
parents have dashed into ink to complain of
the exorbitant price they have to pay for
the books that the Education Department
prescribes for young Victoria. Minister for
Education Alec Peacock, stirred into action
at last by the storm of protests, has expressed
his own opinion that the prices are “some-
thing damnable” ; he adds that he has called
foi a leport, and intends “holding a confer-
ence with his officers.” But, despite the pro-
fane adjective, the bookseller grins cheer-
fully. Alexander has been in charge of the
Department a long while, and the usual fate
of a report or conference is to be suffocated
with dust m a pigeon-hole.
“Fax” in meteorological vein:—
What I resent in “Invalid’s” championship of
the Weather Bureau is the taunt that I “share
the popular belief that in Victoria another ice age is
approaching, and suspect it has remained unnoticed
at the Weather Bureau.” It reminds me of a remark
dropped by a barber the other day. “It ain’t
much like summer,” said he, “but you mustn’t say
so, else you’ll get Mr. Hunt after you.” For some
time past it has been a matter of common remark
that whereas pretty well everybody outside the
Bureau complains of an increasing number of cold
days in the summer (a more consistent streakiness
of climate, so to speak), Mr. Hunt seems to grow
quite angry in denying that anything of the sort
is happening. Meanwhile I subscribe to the popu-
lar belief, not that another ice age is approaching,
but that the average Melbourne summer this cen-
tury has been “less like summer” than it was pre-
viously, and that even temperature figures, fresh
from the Bureau, do not of necessity exactly de-
scribe the climate as we feel it; otherwise 100 de-
grees of heat in Sydney would have exactly the same
feel as 100 degrees in Melbourne— which they don’t
THE MEETING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When first we met, upon my life,
I did not swear that you should be
Some day my lovely little wife;
No pulse made tender play in me.
I had been told that you were sweet,
Neat-handed too, with nimble feet;
You gazed upon me, pansy-eyed,
Absorbed and seeming mystified.
Nor did I falter when we met;
No premonition stirred my soul
That we should be united yet—
I was untroubled, on the whole.
I had not given it a thought.
You were not shy, dear, when I sought
To kiss your cheek ; plain was your glee
That day 1 pulled you to my knee.
I held your hand, and did not blush ;
Love at first sight was not my case.
Your cheek displayed no modest flush,
_ But presently you slapped my face.
Together, now, six years we’ve spent,
And we are one and quite content,
Though kisses given were in fun
When first we met, and you were one!
VICTORIA.

The Cost is too High
The costliest habit among motorists to-
day, is the careless buying of motor car
engine oil.
It is safe to say that at least 50% of all
motor car engine repairs are caused by
“pick up” lubrication.
Your best insurance of engine results is to
ask for Gargoyle Mobiloil, being particular
to specify the correct grade for your car.
When you buy unknown oils, or
cheap oils, you are admitting to
yourself :
“Oh, I don’t care who made
the oil. ”
iprnl jn<t( fJDt/J *1)
liojiqow
“ I don’t care how much carbon I get.**
“ I don’t mind overheating, rapid depre-
ciation, noise or repair bills.
Gargoyle Mobiloil is manufactured from
crude oils chosen for their lubricating quali-
ties. Itis manufactured byprocesscsdesigned
to bring out the highest lubricating value.
This is one of the essential reasons for
the superiority of Gargoyle Mobiloil.
The correct grade of Gargoyle
Mobiloil for your car during its
entire life is specified by the
Vacuum Oil Company’s Chart of
Recommendations.

The Hills of Death.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, tell me when I walk those hills of
death,
Past the lone vale where life has
ceased to run,
Shall I within that place that knows no sun
Have glimpses of the past? Some fragrant
breath
That wanders from a lost! familiar day?
The light of some unfading memory,
To be a lamp along the gloomy way?
Oh heart, I cannot bear it if there be
Across the soaring paths no far-flung ray
To light the dreadful dark that circles me!
I who have loved through warm, white-
clouded springs,
Must surely keep my dear rememberings!
Perchance, when I am wandering, lost and
lone,
Beneath that silence brooding like a pall,
I’ll hear around and all about me fall
An echoing earth-born music faintly blown
Like silver mufHed sounds in dreams half-
heard !
What shall there be? Some ’cello’s sobbing
note ?
The thrilling song of a remembered bird?
The rhapsody that rends a lover’s throat?
Thin threads of sound that all about me float
As soft as summer roses, zephyr-stirred?
Then lost upon some steep, rock-clinging
track.
How shall I sorrow, struggling to turn back !
Lpon those dreary, barren hills of death
(Who knows?) may come a glimpse of once-
loved things.
Green autumn fields with pearly mushroom
rings;
Old, dim, rich gardens breathing out a breath
Of musky roses; and the yellow moon
From out a turquoise bowl of sheer delight,
Splintered to fragments in some far lagoon;
Pale rivers folded to the breast of night,
And windy seas threaded with tangled white!
Perchance I shall, with lovers’ dreams
a-swoon,
Tear at my eyes to rid me of their sleep.
And lift my wild, wild face, and, calling,
weep.
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
The Reformation of Johnson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU remember my deplorable acquaint-
ance Johnson, with whose vagaries
the stories of Elder Man’s Lane
were begun? Well, Johnson went from bad
to better, and from better to best; but his
triends as well as his enemies still had hopes.
They said you’d see him in the gutter again
before twelve months were over. And they
did. They saw to it.
Johnson had once before realised the
drunkard’s dream of reformation. He was
paying up for a cottage. He was pottering
found happily making a kitchen-garden,
which was sensible, for vegetables don t eat
nor liy over into neighbors' gardens; and a
tlower-garden, which was pleasing; and he
was raising hens for his wife and Muscovy
ducks for himself —these at a dead loss. But
at least the ducks were happy, for he made
them a pond with flagstones and cement, and
they were quaint to watch, going about
their domestic duties; and they comforted
his heart in the dark days that were to come.
For Johnson also realised something that
lie never dreamed of in his drinking days.
He soon lost all his drunken ideals. He saw
that his poor little wife (whom he had married
in haste, on account of a tale of ill-treatment
at home) was narrow-minded and selfish;
that she had a permanent tale of illtreat-
ment for anybody she happened to be talking
to, and against everyone else, her husband
especially; that she was, in short, a vin-
dictive, picturesque and circumstantial liar.
She had no soul.
There were frequent and violent wrangles,
and much unhappiness. There had been
little or none in his drinking days. He had
taken most things good-naturedly then, and
had not noticed others. As for the lying,
especially in financial matters, he had rec-
koned it was mostly done for his sake, and
that the nagging and the rest would all cease
when he reformed. That was all part of
his dream.
And yet Johnson was to blame. He should
not have gone round listening to tales of ill-
treatment before he was married ; he should
not have been drinking, and so not in a fit
state to weigh such tales. If he had been
what he should have been he wouldn’t have
taken the girl away from her home. Sym-
pathisers with chronic tales of ill-treatment
generally get their deserts; the misfortune
is that, though chastened and repentant, they
cannot give back the years, the reputations
and the homes they ruin.
Johnson tried gentle persuasion, and even
pleading, but that was worse than other
measures might have been. He was
a weak man. And in the end he
went down on his knees to her and
begged her not to make a Public Scandal.
b>o she explained to the chamber-magistrate
(or whoever it was) thnt Johnson had
pulled her out of bed while in a delicate
state of health, and jumped on her, and
dragged her round the room bv the hair of
the head, and chased her with an axe, and
called her vile names, and struck her with a
bottle, and taken a carving-knife to her.
Also that he had threatened to do for her.
I got hold of Johnson and persuaded him
to let it go by consent, without admissions,
and he was still sane enough to take advice.
Otherwise she would have sworn it all in
open court —and she had “two neighbors
ready to prove it, too.”
Johnson’s wife is not uncommon. There
are hundreds of her in Australia waiting
tor a chance to fling themselves around and
shriek. The English-speaking people, as a
rule, put up with too much from their
women, especially from their tongues; and
the English-speaking people are going to
suffer for it some day.. If they are not now
So Johnson drank avain. and his friends
lost sight of him. They reckoned he’d
gone to the dogs at last, as they
always said he would. He went down
as a matter of fact, into the Under-
world. and stayed there for a year
or two. He managed to live Wt.hout getting
>nto gaol or the lunatic asylum; and he
found a little to do in his own line now
and again. There are kind hearts in the
Underworld, and brother-wrecks who are
often able to help by “puttin’ a few bob
in yer way.” Layin’ yer onter somethin’.
For the rest, he had left the house and fur-
niture and a few pounds with his wife, and
managed to fix up the maintenance fairly
regularly—or his friends did. He was a
weak man, as I said before; and she a sti'ong
woman ; and she seemed to get on infinitely
better without him. I haven’t brought the
children in. They shouldn’t be brought in at all.
There are sisters down in the Underworld,
too. They are not like their sisters of the
upper or superficial world who lie inces-
santly about each other and each other’s
people in a superficial way, and whose lives,
minds, amusements and ambitions even are
just as superficial. They are mostly true to
each other, and to their —their males, this
Sisterhood; they are ready to make any sac-
rifice for a brute, hate an injustice to an-
other fiercely, and are intensely sympathetic.
I believe it was such as they who crept in
fear and trembling from their dens, and, in
terror of their lives, took the body of the Christ
from the cross and washed it hurriedly and
hid it away where none might find His grave,
that night on Calvary, long ago.
It was from a Bad Woman of my acquaint-
ance that I next heard of Johnson; it hap-
pened one morning in a pub up Church Hill
way—a sort of half-way house on the road
to and from the Underworld. At least, she
was only a semi-Bad Woman, and.that only
when she was drinking. A sort of half-
sister to the Sisterhood. I remembered the
days when she had been a Good Woman.
I was on the way down—or tip: I didn’t
know which yet. “Why don’t you take a
tumble to yourself, Mr. Lawrence, and build
yer constitution up wid a little drop of
broth?” she said; and so, being in a chast-
ened mood, we got chatting. She’d just been
down at the Central swearing a black lie
to get a “frind” out of trouble. Every leaf
of that Bible is—dare I say stained? —with
such lies. Her name happened to be Mrs.
Johnson, too, and I thought of the lies the
other Mrs. Johnson would have sworn. She
told me that our mutual friend Johnson was
down at the pub we used to call the Lost
Souls. He had been under the protection
of the landlady, who regarded him as a
“man of deep feeling.”
“The Lily of St. Leonards told me orl
about it,” said my Mrs. Johnson. “She was
down at the Lost Souls last night, an’ Mr.
Johnson was recitin’ the ‘Bridge of Sighs’
to a lot of girls in the parlor. They orl like
him. He talks to them just like other women
—about the world an’ things.”
But now it seemed that the landlady of the
Lost Souls had had to turn Johnson out of
his room: either because his deep feelings
exploded or because she found it was the
beer and not herself he was after; or, as
Mrs. Johnson suggested, mebbe because she
saw she was doing him no good, “God hilp
the woman that.loves min!” she exclaimed.
“He’s sleepin’ in a doss-house now—you
know what that means.”
I knew. I saw in a flash a long, dark,
dirty loft in a disused warehouse that stood
in a dark, damp entry from under a cov-
ered way. The floors were black, and on
either side ran a row of wire stretchers in
various stages of breakdown, with rotten
straw mattresses and horrible fragments of
blankets, and coarse sheeting which even
the whisky-sodden sweeper-out lifted off gin-
gerly with finger and thumb when he “made
the beds.” A dim lamp, hung to a nail on
the wall, was all the light, and it was enor.gh.
It showed nude forms, as in the shades of
Hell, moving about the beds and putting rags
of clothing under the pillows. Some were fine
figures of men, and some fat —none looked
starved. They slept in the buff for the most
part—otherwise “you didn’t get the good out
of your clothes and socks in the morning.”
There were grades of gentility even here,
same as in a better-class lodging-house where
one man might sleep in his shirt and another
in pyjamas. Here the man who slept in his
shirt or socks was rather looked down on,
and the dosser who slept in his clothes was
“a regular mucker.” There were soap and
water and towels downstairs; and a bath.
In the outside wall, where the lamp hung,
were two sliding doors, and bevond them
the narrow platform of a hoist, where the
goods used to be handled. Above projected
a beam with a pulley—from which a' Lost
Soul might have conveniently hanged him-
self. And with some dramatic effect, too;
especially if he did it in the buff.
Sixpence a night, and a large cup of tea
and two biscuits in the morning! For the
proprietor was something of a philanthropist,
too. His clients were all sorts- —broken-
down actors, writers,, artists, singers,
"gents” ; crooks of all kinds; postcard, pic-
ture, and boot-lace sellers; and, in and out
among these, general bar-bummers. We
called it the Abandon Hope Dosshouse.
“I wint there one time to see me husband
whin he was dyin’,” said Mrs. Johnson, “and
help get him into the hospital. ’Twas a
quare objec’ that came for me, too, I re-
member. But they’re kind to each other
down there. God forgive us all! He dodged
across on the horse ferry an’ walked all the
way out to Willoughby to me. ’Twas then
I lost me little place where I used to raise
the eggs an’ flowers to sell. The children
are wid me brother-in-law—God be good to
brothers-in-law! They don’t know but I’m
away charin’, or nursin’, when I do be
away for a day or two drinkin’. They
wouldn’t believe the truth about their mother
anyway, God bless ’em ! But I’m sorry for
yer friend Mr. Johnson. There’s good in
the man yet. He did me a good turn once,
God be good to him ! —an’ so did yourself. God
be good to us all! He’s proud yet: he
wouldn’t take a bob. but he had a drink wid
me this mornin’. He was tellin’ the girls
their fortunes”....
I thought hurriedly. I didn’t like to go
down to Johnson then: you see. the Under-
world doesn’t like to be visited by friends
from even the intermediate world. They’re
proud in their way, the TJnder-worldb'p«s
So T slipped half-a-crown into Mrs. John-
son’s hand and told her to give it to John-
son. or leave it for him with the landlady
of the Lost Souls “from an old friend.”
“I will,” she said, “and God be good to
ye! Or T’li leave it, an’ maybe a bob or two
more, wid the Lily. Good-bye, and God be
good to ye again !”

tells aStory!
Is Every Day a
Backache Day?
Are you dragging along day after day, with a dull,
nagging backache? Does morning find you tired, lame
and stiff? And when evening comes are you all worn
out —barely able to finish the day’s duties and drag
yourself to bed? Truly, life can hold few pleasures when
you feel so miserable. But don’t be discouraged! Just
realise that a cold, a chill or a strain has likely weakened
your kidneys and brought on that all-day backache;
those sudden stabbing pains; the headaches, dizziness and bladder difficulties. But, fortunately,
kidney disorders are usually easily corrected, if treated promptly. So don’t worry! Simply take
things easier for awhile—get plenty of rest and sleep, and help your weakened kidneys with Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor!
CONVINCING SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mrs. S. T. Burrows, 19 Springside Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says:
In common with many others I have nothing but good to say for
Doan s Packache Kidney Pills. Some few years ago I was suffering
a lot with my kidneys, and in consequence was troubled with pains
across the small of my back and dizzy feelings, besides having no
energy for anything. One day my attention was called to Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and, in the hope that they might benefit me, I
got a bottle. After taking them for a few days my health began
to improve, and by the time I had used six bottles I was completely
cured. lam very grateful to Doan’s Pills for the good they have
done me, and hope many will profit by my experience and use this
splendid remedy. I never suffer with backache mow; in fact, feel
splendid in every way.”
Four years later Mrs. Burrows says: “I have had no reason to
alter my good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me some years ago, and I am still well.”
Mr. Jos. Goddard, 6 Windsor Street, Paddington, Sydney, says:
“For some time my health was far from good, due to the fact that
my kidneys were very disordered. I knew this to be the case, as I had
aching pains in my back, was always tired and languid, and could not
get proper rest at night. When I first began to feel off color I did
not bother about it, thinking I would soon be all right again, but
this is where I made the mistake. I got worse instead of better, and
by the time Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me
I was suffering a good deal. A friend advised me to try these pills,
so I got some, and, after taking them for a few days my health began
to improve, and by the time I had used five bottles I was cured. I
feel grand now, thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Six years later Mr. Goddard says: “I am still well, and have had
no return of my old complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me over six years ago.”

I shook hands with Mrs. Johnson, and
raised my hat; and she trotted away with
her basket down in the direction of the Lost
Souls.
There’s faith,and trust in the Underworld;
and enough goodness to give a lot of it a
fair chance of a better world —or even of
salvation in this.
The trouble is the world can seldom let
a man go straight when he is going straight.
The next time 1 saw Johnson he was clean,
and healthy, and well-dressed and calm. He’d
been rescued from the Abandon Hope and
the Lost Souls by a friend —another drunk,
but in , a good position—and taken to the
Receiving House, where he had been nursed
back to light and sanity. Then his friend
had provided him with a good rig-out, and
paid for a couple of weeks’ board and lodging
with an old landlady of Johnson’s pre-
marital days. And, mark ye, a decent suit
and cleah linen and two weeks’ clean board
and lodging will do more for a man than all
your exhorting and preaching and pledge-
taking; more than all your talking about
the different man he looks and is when he
is sober. He knows all that too well, God
help him! Now, Johnson’s wife had been
startled when he took that separation order
seriously; and when the year passed away
and no Johnson appeared she got uneasy and
made advances, lou never can tell what a
woman will do. I’ve known many a wife
to “sepai’ate” a husband when he was a
moderate drinker and take him back when
he was a howling drunk.
So a mysterious change was worked in
Johnson’s wife, and the next time I met
him they were together. She started to
prattle, and she smiled sweetly, and later
she tripped away by his side. The children
were waiting at the corner; the girl took her
father’s arm to cross, and the boy the
mother’s. But, on the Quay, I thought I
saw a Fiend in the shape of an old acquaint-
ance who didn’t know when to leave well
enough alone. Oh, these fussing, mischief-
making busybodies! I believe they do almost
as much harm as the old foolish friend who
deliberately leads you back to the bar—“for
just one.”
The last time I met Johnson he was dirty,
in rags, careless of buttons, and fearfully
shaky. He wanted a dollar, for God’s sake!
He was down in the Abandon Hope once
more. But he’d “get on his feet again.” And
perhaps he will and stay there, provided
some ass doesn’t give him a push into the
gutter—all in the way of friendship.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Kind-hearted War.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A BENEVOLENT-LOOKING person on
all fours was removing a beetle from
the dangerous proximity of passing
boots. Blundering to his feet again, he
accidentally jostled my elbow, bowed, apolo-
gised and raised his hat. I thus met Bil-
bury, the man who abolished war.
Later, we foregathered at a neighbor’s
house to sign a joint petition to the local
council re garbage-tins. Jones had drafted
a full-blooded mixture of imprecation and
entreaty that drove Bilbury to despair.
“Dammitall, man !” shouted Jones angrily
at last, “can’t you see it shows ’em we’ve
got a bit of backbone? So help me, I believe
if a chap punched you in the jaw you’d get
up, apologise and shout him a beer!”
“Of course I would—and poison it,” replied
the gentle-hearted one.
This unexpected remark revealed a side of
Bilbury’s character that Jones learnt more
about immediately. The yapping of the
Joneses’ Pomeranian having inspired him to
fruitless protest, Bilbury suddenly produced
a mastiff that sang all night under their
bedroom window, and finally bit the toy-dog
in two. Jones called about the matter, was
bitten in the leg, took the case to court and
lost it. Then his rent was raised (Bilbury
knew the landlord), his fowls disappeared,
snails ruined his garden, and a thunderstorm
set his roof alight and burnt out his bunga-
low while he was at the pictures. Bilbury
closed the incident by sending him a gramo-
phone-record—“ The Lost Pom”—with arti :
ficial dog-barks in it.
“Best alibi in the world when you’ve run
a live wire to a kerosened-roof,” murmured
Bilbury when I referred to the thunderstorm
later. “But that man’s language—after all
I had done to bring him to a humbler state
of mind ! It makes me despair sometimes of
the ultimate Christian charity of the human
race.”
The Great War broke out soon afterwards,
and Bilbury’s despair of mankind grew some-
thing terrible to witness. His letters of pro-
test to the crowned heads of Europe were
masterpieces. He invented a cocaine-tipped
bayonet, which combined destruction with
painlessness, but the authorities would have
none of it. He endeavored to enlist, but
was rejected on account of eyesight. Bil-
bury then retired into seclusion to perfect
an entirely new scheme of warfare, but his
sylvan quiet was interrupted by loud howls,
crackers, brass-band' - music and general ex-
hilaration and rejoicing. It was the Armis-
tice.
“A day too early,” was his sole comment
when I accosted him in the crowd. “I fixed
my scheme up yesterday. If ever there is
another war”——
“No more war, ole top!” shouted an
elderly, excited citizen, dancing round him.
“All over for ever ’n’ ever. Kaiser deported ;
worl’ made safe f’r democracy! No more
war!”
Bilbury beamed kindly on him, and pushed
him into a horse-trougli.
Everybody remembers the event that led
up to the world-cataclysm of 1924. The
Crown Prince of Rumo-Slovokia slipped on
a piece of banana-skin at the annual ban-
quet of the League of Nations at Buda-
pesth, breaking several glass beads on his
uniform and bruising his dignity in the rear.
The whole thing was obviously a devilish
plot. War was immediately declared on
Fiji. Cocoanuts dropped to zero on the
world’s exchanges, and the nations, ranging
themselves into two camps, prepared for a
repetition of the horrors of 1914.
Australia had good cause to remember the
opening clash of armaments. The Pan-Slovo-
kian Fleet, getting into wireless touch with
the South Seas Navy when the combatants
were respectively in the Gulf of Carpentaria
and off the Barrier Reef, fought a long-range
action that incidentally wiped out Brisbane,
Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide were
obliterated the same day by aerial torpedoes
—it was feared that these cities might be
used as observation-posts. Maoriland was
blown to pieces by submarine mines on gen-
eral principles, and a hundred thousand
tons of poison-gas were released daily in
accordance with the best traditions of modern
warfare. Finally, each Power landed troops
on the Australian mainland, destroyed every-
thing left standing, dug in, and proceeded
to hurl ton-weight masses of iron at each
other. It was a war to gladden the heart
of the most exuberant militarist.
General Vladimir Sczpzych, after a five-
day artillery preparation in which four mil-
lion pounds’ worth of shells were used, pre-
pared for a “hop-over” to seize the nearest
Fijian trench, presumably shaken into a
frenzied submission. (As a matter of fact,
being a mile underground and busy playing
two-up, the Fijians had not even heard the
uproar.j Calling together his trusy Rumo-
Slovokians he harangued them on the sub-
ject of patriotism, loot, justice, murder,
brotherly love and flags, yelled “On to Mar-
rickville!” (two lumps of cement and a dead
tree marking the site of a once-flourishing
suburb), and stumbled up into the open,
waving his sword and followed by his cheer-
ing countrymen.
A queer singing started in his head.
“Szdjamm it!” he muttered, “what the
hzschell’s the matter!” and collapsed. His
men sank to earth around him in untidy
heaps.
When he woke he was comfortably tucked
in bed in a huge building, down which ran a
vista of similar beds till lost in perspective.
All were occupied by sheepish-looking Rumo-
Slovokians, clad in nightdresses. Elderly
dames in large roomy slippers toddled round,
proffering cups of tea to the inmates.
Kettles sang on hobs; there was an odor of
burnt toast and sizzling bacon. Opposite
his own bed, Sczpzych observed with a gust
of warlike indigation, there was a large com-
fortable tom-cat lazily wiping milk-beads
off its whiskers. He groaned—and a motherly
old lady came and rubbed whisky on his
stomach. With wild rage he tried to leap
from the bedstead, only to discover he was
securely strapped in. He was a prisoner.
And then suddenly he remembered Bilbury.
Bilbury had sold the secret of his new
anaesthetic gas to Rumo-Slovokia for a colos-
sal sum, on condition that certain kindly
treatment of prisoners followed its use. The
Rumo-Slovokian Government had signed the
agreement, never intending for a moment to
honor its observance. Yet there was the
very scheme in active practice; the traitor-
ous Bilbury had evidently also sold his
secret to the enemy, who had employed it
first. The miserable reptile seemed to have
as little notion of honor as the Governments
with which he dealt.
Bilbury’s gas made a man harmlessly un-
conscious for 14 days. Combatants over-
come by it could be collected, packed into
trucks, and transhipped well out of the fight-
ing zone. Thus General Sczpzych was at
that moment in Fiji, he and his regiment
having been consigned thither in a fleet of
giant Zeppelins.
It was a harrowing situation for the war-
like General. Day after day more and more
slumbering forms of his countrymen were
dumped into comfortable beds iu huge hos-
pital sheds, till the latter grew to a city
many miles square. Day after day kindly 010
ladies changed his sheets, brushed his hair
and whiskers, made him toast and darned
his bed-socks. Many of his bloodthirsty
command took up knitting. Lay-readers
left him improving tracts. Hymns were suns;
in the evening, and everyone was securely
tucked in bed by 8 o’clock. Whether the
Rumo-Slovokians were also employing Bil-
bury’s gas he could only conjecture, for
never a breath of news stirred the quiet or
that haunt of ancient peace.
And then the day broke when there was
no tea and toast and no old women. Leaping
from his cot —his bonds had been loosened
while he slept—General Vladimir Sczpzych
found himself confronted by the beaming
countenance of Bilbury.
“Ach, traitor!” shouted the noble General.
“Insect! Liar! Did you not tell me that
through your infernal gas we, the Rumo-
Slovokians, would take Fiji?”
“Come and take it,” purred Bilbury, lead-
ing the bewildered General and his men out
into the palm-groves of Levuka, now abso-
lutely deserted by its former inhabitants.
“B-b-but, where are the Fijians?” gasped
Sczpzych.
“In Rumo-Slovokia, of course,” beamed
Bilbury. “Both armies used my gas, you
see, to its logical conclusion. The last
Old Women’s Brigade—left for
the front and were gassed yesterday. The
complete Fijian nation is in Europe: the
entire population of Rumo-Slovakia is here.
Each of you has won the war!”
“Now we are together in nations we can
. begin to fight again, ain’t it?” queried the
General, hopefully.
“If you like,” said Bilbury. “But you’ll
simply waste a lot. of; money—the price of
my gas is going up from now on —and you’ll
end up again exactly as you are. However,
if you feel like it, get to it.”
But they didn’t. The logic of the matter
was obvious enough even to the most case-
hardened diplomatist. Making the best of a
puzzling job both Rumo-Slovokia and Fiji
claimed to have won the war, exchanged
nation for nation as prisoners, and de-
manded huge indemnities, which came to
exactly the same sum. War vanished from
the earth from that hour, Bilbury’s formula
making it such a foregone drawn game that
it was naturally looked on as a vexatious
waste of time. Grave international disputes
were thereafter settled by the toss of a coin.
So ended the Last War, the Kind-hearted
War, that cost millions of money and ended
exactly where it started. Nobody made any-
thing out of it except Bilbury, and he did not
live to enjoy his well-deserved gains. He
foolishly announced one day that he had dis-
covered an antidote to his own gas, and was
at once knocked on the head by a Committee
of National Safety.
