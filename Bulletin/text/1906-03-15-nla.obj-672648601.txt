LITTLE BOOKS
LUCKILY the plague of little books
comes not without occasional benison.
Detestable little books are those
summarising bigger books that must
be swallowed whole to yield their value, or
those squeezing the last drop of weariness
from a staled subject. But others come as
hors d’oeuvres to fillip the literary appetite
—opening a fresh vista on a trodden path,
or a fresh path to a new artistic landscape.
These may be bought and sucked like a
pugilist’s lemon, as extraneous aids to virtue.
Book-series curiously begin to die as soon
as born. When their subjects have an in-
definite extension, —such as personalities in
art or literature, —one sees no reason why
they should not continue indefinitely ; yet
they don’t, apparently can’t. Does pub-
lisher or editor or reader lose interest in the
task ? How many series have we not seen de-
scend to Avernus ?—suddenly or with the
“ long stagger ” of the horse-poets. Yet some
have not been bettered by the years—..lorley’s
“Menof Letters,’’for example. Why did that
series close ? Because M. had other things to
do ? Then it is on the editor’s choice for good or
evil that the series depends for existence, his
choice of the subject and the man. That
conclusion should have come “ by inspec-
tion," instead of roundabout: the value of
the editor is the value of the series.
Who was the man who invented the form
and style of the paragohic Aldine “British
Poets.” And Gilfillan’s “ British Poets ”in
their way are no less worthy. Why is the
Mermaid series in the old brown covers
lovable, while the new thin-paper edition is
damnable ? Why does the Contemporary
Science series hold its value, for the greater
part, while for the greater part the
International Scientific Library falls to
disrepute. How should the Keynotes
series, starting so well, end so miserably ?
Why does the Muses Library droop to “ re-
mainders,” while Grosart’s Elizabethan
Library, in the original brown backs, scarcely
changes its valuation. To all these ques-
tions and the like there may be nine dis-
tinct and obvious answers ; but some
answers are no response. In this day
of scientific mystics one can surely gain
credence for a theory of spiritual microbes
that destroy the Syme-soul of a series, and
leave its husk to perish presently of un-
financial inanition.
JC
A good series began m Heinemann’s
“Contemporary Men of Letters” (Is. fid.
net). The idea is to give a biographical and
critical account of the men now or recently
writing, the men now or still being read—
instead of reiterating weary themes. Every
year the classic authors recede in perspec-
tive. Those who deal with human instincts
may be practically immortal : those
who utter intellectual speculations carry
too much baggage useless to us. The
world may be no wiser than Plato,
but scie.nce has given a sounder basis
for its wisdom ; and there is no sense in
stumbling over guesses when one can walk
in surety. The most masterly book of Heine-
mann’s first three— Walter Pater , by
Ferris Greenslet—may stand for the
ideal which every publisher of a series
hopes fondly to maintain. As far as
one knows, it is the best short account of a
writer whose work is worth meditation.
His life “ was like that of Gray, essentially
an academic product. ” ‘‘ He saw the burden
of the mystery with a sad lucidity of view.
Instead of being passionately disturbed by
it, he was pleasantly interested as he sat at
ease in his ivory tower.” Greenslet’s criti-
cism is suggestive, and in its measure just.
William Butler Yeats, by H. S. Krans, in
the same series, is descriptive rather than
critical ; and is the least efficient of the trio.
H. W. Boynton, who writes of Bret Harte,
takes a definite and disparaging view of his
subject ; and his personal information seems
more curious than his critical opinion is
valuable. Each of the little volumes has its
portrait.
J*
The counsel to “Be Drunken” in last
issue was a version by Arthur Symons of
one of Baudelaire’s fifty “Little Poems in
Prose.” Symons hqp translated a dozen
cleverly enough, and they are published in
Elkin Mathews’ “Vigo Cabinet Series ” (Is.
net) —another good series. Chiefly it is com-
posed of booklets of Eng. minor verse : some
of the kind that we do better in Australia,
and some of the more scholarly, less lyrical
kind that is rarely attempted here. Mathews’
series is up to No. 32—and some of the
numbers are notable. One meets John
Masefield, Yeats, John Todhunter, and
others less notorious.
The last three numbers are given to Sea
Danger , by R. G. Keatinge ; Shadows, by E.
Gibson ; An Hour of Reverie, by F. P.
Sturm. A few book-buyers will enjoy these:
if not divine, they are dainty, and there is a
light of phrase or fancy here and there. The
best is Sturm, from whose work some lines
are excerpted.
PHILOSOPHICALLY SPRAKING
LET us start. Possibly we shall arrive ;
but the thing is to start. Is it neces-
sary ? At least it is advisable :if one
never starts, one never arrives—at
dinner, for example. And dinner is advis-
able, is even necessary. Or seems ? Well,
some seemings are so close to reality that
the difference is indistinguishable. Was
Berkeley really hungry when he got no
dinner !■ Yet is it not rather dinner-time
that arrives ? I trust we shall both arrive
together; but if I didn’t now, we mightn’t
later... And you, you have paid your six-
pences—or have borrowed or stolen the
paper—and are entitled to something in
return : that is just. The justness of the
Hour and the Man, the justice of Something
for Sixpence (or nothing in the guise of
something): these things are rooted in the
universal depths—which, as you say justly,
are heights if one so regard or label them.
To every force its l'eeoil of force : to every
Jack his Jill—or as the N.Q. parson said :
“First I christen a boy, and then a girl—
and then a boy, and then a girl—and then a
boy, and then a girl— How these little things
dovetail in ! ”
Let us start. But do we start ? I fear
not : I am sure not. We continue only.
Confucius, standing by a stream, said : “It
passes on just like this , never ceasing.” And
we, they, all, pass on just like that, never
ceasing. “ The Eternal Saki from the bowl
has poured millions of bubbles like us, and
will pour.” “The cloud-capt towers, the
gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the
great globe itself—yea, all which it inherit,
snail dissolve,” and like this insubstantial
article faded, leave behind the essential
energy that called them into being—the
germ, percnance, of new towers, palaces,
temples, globes, articles even... Mean-
while, sun and rain, and winter and summer,
and seed and harvest, and dinner-time, shall
not cease. Let us then continue.
I have not verified my quotations, but it
occurs to me that the Biblical one is the
cloudiest.. The significance is this : that it
is time the Hebrew and Christian Bibles
were printed as English literature—not in
small type encumbered with all their rubbish,
but as readable pocket or library classics, in
a series of volumes of extracts critically
edited and historically annotated.
i had it in mind when I started “To
start ’ seems after all a fair description of a
change in the mode of continuance—a change
from rest to action—really a change from one
kind of action to another kind. Best, of course,
is potential activity ; and a truly restful man
has that Spaniard s air of being a coiled-up
spring, ready at any moment to discharge
force. To intelligent people with a difficulty
in getting up o’ mornings I would recom-
mend, first, medical attention, and second,
a print of Differs “Melencolia” fixed
opposite the bed. Impressions may diifer,
of course ; but I find in that print anything
rather than stagnant passivity. The sense
of tension, of concentration, of energy in
leash, ends by driving you to muscular
motion. Even James Thomson admitted
this in saying the lady gives the strong new
strength :
Her subjects often gaze up to her there :
1 he strong to dri iik new strength of iron endurance ,
The weak, new terrors : all , renewed assurance
And confirmation of the old despair.
But “the old despair” was merely in
Thomson’s mind. He was Early-Victorian,
and the Early-Victorian epoch was one of
anxious soul-searching, or searching for a
soul. Browning searched, and Tennyson, and
Browning’s friend Domett, and Mat Arnold.
David iSyme is still searching. It isn’t
necessary ; it is n’t even advisable. Life is
a spectacle : It passes on just like this, never
ceasing.
d*
A friend of mine took up land in the back-
blocks thirty years ago. He cultivated, and
fought, and struggled, and lied and swore,
and did good and bad turns, and hoarded his
Dream. His dream was to see Life. A
little ago, he sold out, got some thou-
sands, came to Sydney and banked them,
and settled down in a corner pub. as
a superior boarder at 30s. a week. What
does he do l He sees Life. Every morning
he reads his paper, has his breakfast, and
goes out —and the whole brilliant panorama
of Life is before him. Labourers mending
a pavement will fascinate him for an hour.
He can watch a ferry-boat for a day. For
him are displayed the noble attitudes of the
policeman and the moving splendour of the
trams. He has the child’s or Nero’s glorious
mind, and everything interests him. The
pageant of the world passes, and it costs
him only 21. a week to view it as a spectator
in a theatre. He goes to all the fires,
all the political meetings, all the religious
services : he even goes to the Museum. His
“soul” is safe in the care of the R.C. church
—and if one feels anxious about one’s “ soul,”
there’s no better place for it. “Renewed
despair ! ” —nonsense : he lives and enjoys
every waking minute. And it is so cheap 1
so easy !
Of course, he is an old bachelor.
CRACKING A STOCKWHIP
This is the Wisdom of William Mills
Who under the Name of Saltbush Bill ’s
Known in Gippsland where he cracks
Bis Stockwhip with resounding thwacks.
IT isn’t what you would call a national
industry, but it’s a pretty good side-
line for an expert.
Whips are of two kinds—stock-whips and
bullock-whips : riding-whips and bus-whips
are toys, and don’t count. Stockwhips are
part of the outfit of every cattle-drover, tra-
velling or stationary ; or rather, they were.
The good old stockwhip is going out of
fashion, supplanted by the dog. Drovers
nowadays, instead of racing round a mob of
cattle with a whip, will sit still and sing out
to their dogs, “For’ard there !” “ Off side!’
“Near side ! ” —and the dogs do the work.
And the heavy stockwhip 15 or 20ft. long
has given place to a lighter one 9 or 10ft.
long—lighter and handier, though not so
punishing. Perhaps the bullocks are tamer
now than they used to be, and don’t ask for
a heavy whip. The old-style whip might
weigh 2or 31b. in all: the new style goes
only lor b.
A stockwhip has four parts—the handlej
the thong, the fall, and the cracker. Han-
dles used to be carved out of any favourite
wood, and were often highly ornamented by
inlaying and carving; but the plaited kan-
garoo handle, with a whalebone or steel
centre, has come into use in the East in the
last seven or eight years. The length of a
handle is nicely adjusted to the weight of
the whip. An ounce more or less will make
all the difference in the balance of a handle.
Handle and whip are separate : the end of
the handle carries a leather keeper, which
ties upon a keeper on the whip. The whip
itself is kangaroo or bullock hide, plaited in
from Bto 30 strands. The best whips are
hand-made. The whip tapers up to the
belly of the thong, and tapers down to the
fall; and it is partly in the adjustment of
this taper to the length of the whip that the
whip-maker’s art is shown.
The best whip-maker I found in Victoria
is Simon Fraser, of Bodalla ; the best I’ve
seen in N. S. Wales is T. Henderson, of
Sydney. Kangaroo makes the best whips.
Any hide will make a whip—bullock hide,
for example—but nothing plaits as fine and
wears as well as kangaroo. The fall is a
strip of greenhide, to which is tied the
cracker —a six-inch plait of silk. The best
silk makes the best cracker. It not only
wears the best, but cracks the best; and the
crack makes the stockwhip. A stockwhip is
a striking whip : but when a beast will turn
from the crack you don’t need to strike.
&
A whip in the air is like a living thing, and
to handle it you want knack and practice.
You never find two whips alike. Even if
they ’re the same length and the same weight,
the same in every respect, one will fall dif-
ferently from the other. A good man should
be able to use a stockwhip equally well with
both hands, so that it does n’t matter which
side of a bullock he’s on. There’s great
rivalry among men who handle whips, and
many a competition to decide who has the
best hand. In competitive cracking, the art
is to keep the whip alive—to get as many
cracks as possible before the whip buckles on
itself or falls dead. Nine cracks is my
average : forward, back, left and right side
level, left and right overhead, left and right
side level again, forward and back again, and
so on—until the whip beats you. I may get
more than nine, but it is n’t certain.
I reckon the most difficult crack is' over-
head, because the whip gets angry at being
kept up, and tries to fall on you. That
sounds funny, but it’s so : a whip in the air
has an individuality of its own. I’m speak-
ing of one-handed cracks : changing hands
from side to side, you might keep on till
further notice. It’s a good game when you
remember that a stroke that does n’t crack
puts you out. I’ve heard of men that can
pick up a threepenny-bit with a right-
handed stroke and catch it in their left
hands. I can’t do that; but I ’ll put out a
candle at 10ft. distance without breaking the
candle ; or put out a match held in my left
hand. If the candle had a long wick I might
cut the wick and send it lighted through the
air ; but you can’t do that every day. Or
I ’ll hit a fair-sized coin thrown in the air.
Cutting your name on a tree or on
a bullock’s hide is not so difficult ; but
of course you can’t cut round letters
I ’ll cut W M for you so that you ’ll
know the letters, though the ends
may not exactly join. Henderson, of
Sydney, has had a 65ft. exhibition stock-
whip in his window (weight about 151 b.;
36-plait) with a prize offered to anybody whc
can crack it with one hand. The difficulty
is in the handle, which is too long. A
handle works like a lever, and this one
keeps the whip too far away. But I
got some cracks out of it right enough
—with two hands though. Before coming
to Sydney I was at the A. IST. A. Exhibition
in Melbourne ; and one can make a pound
or two now and again wagering and ex-
hibiting at show's.
&
Bullock whips are another story altogether.
They ’re used by men on foot, and the handle
will run six or seven foot long. A nice
wattle sapling makes a good one. The whip
may be the length of the new-fangled stock-
whip—about 9ft. The handle is longer so
that bullocky can reach over a near-side beast
and tap an off-sider without going round his
team ; and there’s some art in handling that
whip too, so as to hit the right beast in the
right place every time. But the bullock
whip isn’t the thing of art and beauty that
the old stockwhip is ; and less care and
dexterity go to the making, because of the
rougher work. A heavy stockwhip in a
good hand will turn the worst piker that ever
rushed. Naturally, because you can blind
him if you want to. On a good day, in the
right country, you can hear a stockwhip
crack three miles away. I don’t know with
what force a 30ft. stockwhip strikes, but
men who have got a cut by accident say it
LOVE IN AUTUMN.
The dying fires of autumn softly fold
The time-worn woods in gold ;
Like our sunft lives the waters of the river
Drift from our sight for ever ;
The setting sun has drawn a misty veil
Over the waters pale.
And bathed your hands and brows in dreamy light,
Fading and bright.
So let us, love, in these dream-haunted ways,
Remember those bright days
When love awoke beneath the whispering pine.
And your brow drooped to mine —
For though life be at autumn-time or spring,
And joy or sorrow brinj,
You are the Queen of each enchamted hour,
0 breathing flower 1
F. P. Sturm, in An Hour of Reverie.
G. B. Shaw’s new Lon. play, Major Barbara,
is accredited with the familiar cleverness and the
familiar heartlessness. E. Balfour, in Feb.
National Review, repeats the old commentary
when she says that Shaw “ does not suggest the
mysterious presence of life, he only dissects its
manifestations Seated before the footlights
we acknowledge our follies and our inconsisten-
cies, our assumed and our true motives, our sordid
aspirations, but all the tim« we feel we are
greater than we know, or, to put it more gently,
greater than Mr. Shaw knows.” Still, the play
is worth while: when will “ the enterprising
managers” of the daily press bring it here? and
the others ?
Frank Bullen, announced as coming to lecture
in Australia, is a beautiful...writer of fiction. He
has an emotional sense, and a sense of rhetoric ;
there are good passages in his religio-nautieal
stories; and there are passages that read like
Jonah revised by Tartuffe. Sailors have been
reported as considering his books “overdrawn”—
a mild word. Still, suitably sauced with texts,
there is no reason why the ideal of the remarkable
tar with the upturned eyes, shaming a profane
fo’c’s’le to silence, should not be accepted by
church-going audiences at least.
A curious passage in M. MacDonagh’s article in
Feb. Monthly Review represents the House of
Commons as a kind of sanitarium for elderly
gentlemen. He says many men are m Parliament
“ mainly for their health.” During the day they
manage banks or industries, and in the evening
tney go to the House of Commons “for that
rest and solace which comes with change of
scene and occupation. ” “Many old men
who have spent themselves in trade or
finance take to politics in the evening of
their days as a mild relaxation, and a means of
prolonging life. It is a soothing existence.”
“They seem to grow younger every day.”
Disraeli once said to a friend just seated : “ You
have chosen the only career in which a man is
never old. A statesman can feel and inspire inte-
rest longer than any other man.” “In truth,”
says MacDonagh, “ the call of Parliamentary life
is irresistible.” And when, as in Australia, it
has a cash value !
Fred Johns, whose business in life is to shower
fame with generous hands upon Australians
notable and otherwise, is sub-editor of Adelaide
Register and Evening Journal ; American-born 33
years ago, but Australian since boyhood—and on
the staff of The Register and its associated journals
for over twenty years.
Corrections are highly objectionable: they
maculate one’s armour of infallibility. Two highly ob-
jected to :—R. S. R —8, was not the first editor of Barrier
Truth, Error due to his awkward statement on 23/2 6 :
“ I began the editing, of Truth with the first issue in
March, 1903.” Pendergast,” whose rough-riding
prowess was acknowledged, finds that his name is “ Pren-
dergast” after all. “You see,” he explains, “up the
country it did n’t matter, and all the boys used to call
me ‘ Pender ’; but when our folks came down to Sydney
you see they put the gas on it, and they found out it was
Prendergast alrjght.” Note “to put the gas on a
variant of “ to put the acid on,”—-the latter familiar
slang from the mine-assayer’s lexicon.

rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.
For city, country or camp it is the gun of the day.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mid-day.
Hark to the hour ! The muted chime throbs
slowly,
Drifting to stillness down the charmed air,
To sense a-tune, half joy, half melancholy,
And all at rest from care.
Up the pleached walk the quiet footfalls linger,
Pause, and pass on by alleys petal-strewn ;
Across the sun-lit dial a shadow finger
Halts on the mark of noon.
Only the fountain wakes. A questing swallow
Skims the clear pool ; bright waters, tossed in vain,
Fall with glad murmur back to the carven hollow,
Sprayed to a silver rain.
About the terrace marble-benched and paven
Lies the broad sunlight; mist-enveiled, strange,
Beyond the deep-sea purple of the haven,
Shadowy headlands range.
Faint as a dream the far ethereal islands
On the pale verge of dim horizons lie.
Noontide is drowsing in the lap of silence
Under the vast of sky.
QUEENSLAND.
A.W.
Keverie.
Here the road swerves,
Its slow unwinding length now finds the sea;
The broken harbor with its glassy curves
Dreams like a woman, breathing silently.
And faint, beyond the three trenched. points of
land
That jut between us and the further side,
The square grey towers and the tall chimneys
stand
(Against the sun) of Sydney’s civic pride.
O breathless walls of stone, less kind than hate,
How often in my hot and quick-spent days
Have I, exhausted, beaten at thy gate
With hope of walking in thy highest ways.
And often from the wooded Northern hills
I’ve watched the broad pulsating beam of light
That binds your lofty forehead there and thrills
The bay of Heaven at the stroke of night.
And, as I gazed , I grew mere comforted
To think, that looking down again from Mars,
That flame, complete unto its widest spread,
Was not enough to make two tiny stars.
N.S.W.
HUGH M'CRAE.
The White Man’s Burden?
Take up the White Man’s Burden ? Oh, cease
that sad refrain !
There’s something in that hackneyed phrase that
fills my soul with pain !
Others may vainly struggle, by fervent zeal
inspired,
To elevate humanity, but I was born too tired.
Tali eup the White Man’s Burden? I’ve carried
it for years ;
The thorny path of progress is watered with my
tears,
But it takes so much hard labor to crawl each
weary mile,
That, judging by results attained, it doesn’t seem
worth while.
Oh, for some spot where I could lay that burden
down and rest! —
Some sweet secluded South Sea isle would suit
my purpose best,
Where I could lie beneath the palms the live-long
tropic day,
And gaze out o’er the sapphire sea and dream my
life away.
There, while the cool soft trade-wind breathed its
scent upon my face,
I should not trouble much about the future of my
race,
But lazily I’d listen to the rustle of the leaf,
And the ceaseless cannonading of the breakers on
the reef.
And, dozing thus, the old, old life with all the
old defects,
The strife of politicians, and the snarling of the
sects;
The sordid money-grubbing, and the snobbishness
would seem
Like the swiftly-fading phantoms of some half-
remembered dream.
Take up the White Man’s Burden ? Would I
could live and die
A simple child of Nature, beneath that sunny sky !
Far from the strife of modern life, where I could
safely shirk
The white man’s cult of progress, and the white
man’s Creed of Work.
MAORILAND.
DON PEDRO.
Remembrance.
Do you remember that sweet night
Upon the waters long ago?
The ferry boats, illumined bright.
Which travelled softly to and fro ;
The stars that lit the tranquil skies,
The blind man singing on the quay,
The city’s thousand golden eyes,
The moonlight’s silver mystery ;
The long reflections tremulous,
The gems of light on spar and mast,
The sailor’s cries which came to us,
The garden perfumes as we passed?
Do you remember ? Naught replies.
The colors fade from land and sea;
Closed are the city’s golden eyes;
Dumb is the singer on the quay.

How to A ddress Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, ivhere practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence ” column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,

THE PROPOSED FISCAL REFERENDUM.
In Westralia the process of selecting Labor can-
didates for the Federal elections next December
lias commenced, and by way of a valuable innova-
tion it has been proposed that the men who ask
for the party’s nomination should state their fiscal
beliefs. The Labor party in Parliament professes
to have no fiscal belief, but its individual members
have; and it is held that if the Labor electors
prefer to send in Protectionists to sink the fiscal
issue, or if they desire to send in Freetraders to
submerge the same unsinkable object, they have
a right to do so. The tricky Freetrade section of
the party, on the other hand, objects to any men-
tion of the candidates’ tariff views, on the ground
that the fiscal question is to be settled by a
Referendum at the December elections, and
they say that the matter should be left alone
tiirthen. This is the first that a great many
people have heard about the proposed Fiscal
Referendum, but it was really decided at the last
great Labor Conference that such a thing should
be held if the party can bring it about. And the
idea is an excellent one, supposing the party can
carry its point —which, with the aid of the Pro-
tectionists, is almost certain —and assuming
that the Referendum is taken honestly and
is not loaded. If the Freetrade party can
manage it, however, the Referendum will be
loaded and will not be taken honestly. It is also
possible, by the way, that another popular vote
may be taken next December— re the amendment
of the Constitution to give the Australian Govern-
ment power to compulsorily take over the State
debts as they stand to-day. If a double Referen
dum happens along with a general election De-
cember will be a month worth living for.
* * * *
As regards the tariff question, there is no satis-
faction to be gained out of a ballot paper with the
bald question:
Are you in favor of
(1) Protection ?
(2) Freetrade ?
Nor is there any more satisfaction to ue gained
from a ballot paper with the equally hairless
query :
Are you in favor of
(1) Protection?
(2) Revenue Tariff?
(3) Freetrade ?
The bulk of the people don’t know what a revenue
tariff is, and without a sample tariff to go on,^ not
one in a thousand knows what Freetrade is. Even
in N.S.W., the alleged home of Freetrade, the
animal has always been out when anybody called.
In the time of the great Freetrader Parkes and all
his Freetrade predecessors, Fi’eetrade in N.S.W.
consisted in heavily protecting beer, bacon,
biscuits, buckets, butter, candied, preserved and
dried fruits, candles, cement, cheese, cigars,
cigarettes, confectionery, temperance drinks, corn-
flour, doors, galvanised iron goods of all kinds,
hams and tongues, jams and jellies, lead (red and
white) molasses and treacle, oils, paints, postsand
rails, fish, raisins, raspberry pulp, salt, window
sashes, methylated spirits, sugar (raw and refined),
timber, tobacco, snuff, varnish, wine, &c. Under
the great Freetrader Reid, Freetrade consisted in
heavily protecting wine, beer, tobacco, cigars,
cigarettes, biscuits, confectionery, jams and jellies,
and raw and refined sugar. Under both
of them Freetrade consisted in giving |d.
per copy Protection on each N.S.W. news-
paper that went through the post office, which
in the case of a penny paper meant 50 per cent.
It also consisted in giving immense bonuses or
subsidies or indirect Protection to the N.S.W.
farmer and others by carrying their produce by
rail for about one-half or one-fourth of the cost of
carriage, and by differentiating between N.S.W.
and foreign goods in the matter of railway charges
and harbor dues. Protection running up to 50 or
75 per cent, isn’t Freetrade. Therefore the per-
sons and papers that have talked of N.S.W. as a
Freetrade State have been aggravated liars.
The alleged enthusiastic vote which N.S.W. has
been in the habit of giving for Freetrade has been
a lie pure and simple. The old State politicians
who said they were Freetraders were liars. The
present Federal politicians from N.S. W. who say
they are Freetraders are liars also, unless they pro-
pose a very different kind of Freetrade from any
they developed in their old State days. And the
whole Freetrade business, so far as N.S.W. was
concerned, has been the most extensive fraud,
swindle, and confidence-trick on record.
* * * *
If there is to be a Fiscal Referendum on the
issues of Protection r. Freetrade, it should be, this
time, on the question of genuine Protection v.
real Freetrade. The scoffing Joe Cook, and the
superior Bruce Smith, and the enthusiastic
Conroy, and the blatant Wilks have sneered at
Protection for years, while they practised it and
lived politically by it. They have called them-
selves Freetraders when they weren’t, and they
have pointed to the results of their Protection as
a proof of the blessings of not having Protection.
They have been amazing political bounders and
impudent political spielers; and it is time for
them to be brought up, once for all, against the
dead wall of their own alleged creed. The
simplest and most effective way of putting the
question to the people is to draft two tariffs, and
enact that the one which gets the majority of votes
shall become law—the tariffs to go on these
lines: —
(1) Protectionist tariff, with duties running up to 100
per cent, in some cases, sufficient to fully cover the
difference in wages and hours between the Australian and
his cheapest foreign competitor, with something over
where necessary, as a guarantee against “ dumping,” and
with due allowance for the fact that a small new industry
can’t be worked as cheaply as a large, old-established one.
Where necessary, as might be in the iron trade, the new
tariff might commence with a bonus system, the duties
to begin a little later on. In fact, Kingston’s tariff, with
enlargements and improvements.
(2) Freetrade-Revenue tariff (genuine article, as it is in
England, where Cobden flourished), calculated to yield
about as much revenue as the present tariff. Duties
confined as closely as possible to wine, beer, spirits and
tobacco, with say sugar and tea thrown in if necessary. In
every case the Customs duty on the imported article to be
counter-balanced by an exactly equal excise duty on the
local article if there is one. No semblance of Protection for
anybody, not even the big breweries, and tobacco and
sugar firms, but the. glorious blessing of Free Competition
all round. A statement to be appended that the Com-
monwealth, if this 1 tariff is carried, will endeavor to
suppress or counteract the evil habit of giving surrep-
titious Protection to the local producer by reduced rail-
way freights from the inlands to the coast as compared
with those on the other journey, or by reduced railway
and harbor charges.
This would put the case in a nutshell. It would
be genuine Protection against genuine Freetrade
—or, at least, genuine Freetrade as far as it is
practised in England, which country is the glorious
example quoted by all Australian Freetrade news-
papers. If any excessive Oobdenite desired that
there should be submitted to the people a third
issue—academic Freetrade {i.e., no tariff at all), and
that the £8,030,000 or £9,000,000 of lost revenue
be made good by extra land and income-tax, poll-
tax, or other direct imposts—there is no reason at
all why that third issue should not be submitted.
But it is very uhlikely that anybody would ask
for it, and this possibility is hardly worth
discussing.
* * * *
Of course it will be said that to put the matter
in this way is brutal and extreme. It is not
brutal—only business-like; and it is not ex-
treme —only logical. The skulkers of the Free-
trade party have quoted Britain ad nauseam
as the bright and shining example to be followed;
it is fair to put them to a vote on the
question of really following Britain’s example.
They have declared all Protection to be disastrous,
even ruinous, also foolish, illogical, antiquated,
and many other adjectives of great tonnage ; it is
quite justifiable to push them into a corner and
make them vote against all Protection, or admit
themselves the frauds and hypocrites they are.
They have alleged a thousand times that Free-
trade is the road to wealth and prosperity; on
their records it is only possible to assume that
they said this believing it to be untrue, and con-
sequently that Ananias left a large family, or else
that they really believed Protection was utterly
injurious, and practised a good deal of it when
they ruled N.S.W. for the deliberate purpose of
injuring the country, in which case it is only pos-
sible to assume that they were paid by some
foreign rival to injure the country. In
the former instance they only call for
contempt ; in the latter instance there is
hardly a Freetrade politician in N.S.W. who
doesn’t deserve to be hanged, and by putting a
straight issue to a popular vote it might be
ascertained with some certainty whether they
merited a jeer or a gallows. No doubt, if the
Referendum resulted in a triumph for real Free-
trade the result would be ruinous, but against that
it can only be said that the majority is supposed
to rule, and the right of the community to ruin
itself is indubitable. At the worst the ruin would
not be for long ; within two years from the date
when Australia adopted real Freetrade it would
have a genuine Protectionist tariff, and the Free-
trader would be almost as extinct as the
pterodactyl.
The thing above all others which the Reid
party—mostly a Tory and anti-White Labor
party—desires next December is not to find the
fiscal spectre in its path. It hopes to run the
election on Socialism v. anti-Socialism, arid to so
expound the imaginary horrors of an imaginary
Socialism—with its confiscation of all wealth and
all industries, its community of wives and its
general breaking up of the happy home —that it
will secure a victory. With a huge section of the
daily press to help it in explaining the imaginary
horrors of what it calls Socialism, it might win on
these terms. Its anxiety to avoid the fiscal issue
shows it to be quite aware that it has no hope of
success on that question. This in itself is a good
reason why the fiscal issue should be raised ; it is a
foolish thing to fight on the ground that your
enemy has chosen if you can fight bn the ground
of your own choosing. If the Labor party decides
to do all it can to push the tariff question to a
Referendum, and to do. it on the lines here sug-
gested, it need not therefore depart from its tra-
ditional and most unfortunate attitude of fiscal
atheism. The Protectionist members of the party
would be willing, and more than willing, to appeal
to the country on the question of genuine Protec-
tion. The Freetrade members of the party—
unless they are the same political shams and hypo-
crites as Reid, Cook, and that enthusiatic advocate
of nigger labor, Bruce Smith— must be equally
willing to appeal to the people on the question of
real Freetrade. The whole party professes to be-
lieve in the principle of the Referendum, so both
sections should be willing twice over. As regards
the election itself the Labor party could be as demo-
cratic as it pleased and sink the fiscal issue as
much as it pleased, merely promising, as far as
concerned the tariff question, to accept the deci-
sion of the majority. It could keep out of the
fiscal shindy as much as it liked, and go round
picking up odd seats amid the chaos. It could
talk all the Socialism it pleased ; in the general
confusion and the breathless hurry, the chances
are that no one would have time to say anything
about anti-Socialism. The whole time of every-
body outside the Labor party would be occupied
in the struggle to get votes on the tariff
question, and to crowd in men who would do
something to nullify the result of the Referendum
supposing the other party carried its point on the
tariff vote. The poor little dusty cobweb of the
anti-Socialist propaganda would vanish as if the
Atlantic had struck it. The alliance between the
Freetrade Tories and a handful of Protectionist
Tories would split asunder when once fiscalism
came to the front. The Freetrade party, com-
pelled to vote at the Referendum for its own
alleged creed for the first time in its life, or else
to vote for Protection, or else not to vote at all,
would be rent in pieces; and Reid, and Cook,
and Conroy, and the two Smiths (Bruce and
Pumpkin), and Wilks, and Fuller, and Lons-
dale, and M'Millan (who would doubtless
rush back into the fray to defend his imported
calicoes), would be a loose assortment of raving
atoms. Nothing more picturesque could be
imagined than the Freetrade anti-Socialist
party brought up with a crash against its own
fiscal belief—the belief it has dodged so carefully
for so many years. Instead of being a haughty
and superior crowd talking about the ignorance
of Socialists and such like, it would be a hot, dis-
hevelled object in a burst collar, explaining inco-
herently that Freetrade was a good thing—had
always been the only really good thing—and that,
at the same time, the conduct of a nefarious com-
bination in offering the country the real article
was calculated to call down the vengeance of God
on that combination’s joint and several head. In
short, the Freetrade-anti-Socialist crowd would
have run against the one thing in its creed that it
can’t explain. There is little wonder that it
wants fiscal peace, but with such a handy weapon
ready to their hands its opponents will be pro-
foundly foolish if there is any fiscal peace to be
found next December.
CORN IN EGYPT.
The Federal Labor party made a great stride
forward in public estimation with the policy
speech of J. C. Watson to his constituents last
week. It was a remarkable meeting in many re-
spects. Speaking from a hotel balcony, the ex-
Premier had an intermittent dust-storm and an
alarm of fire to contend with in keeping his
audience, yet held a streetful of people attentive
whilst, without a quip or a low-comedy joke, he
talked on the “dry” subject of finance. Prac-
tically the whole speech was finance. A good-
natured thrust or two at G. H. Reid, whom
Watson, either with consummate art or from
genuine conviction, treated with an airy
contempt; a slight passing reference to the con-
stituents who had stood to him so well and whom
he was now in all probability losing through a re-
distribution of seats, occupied but moments. The
bulk of a lengthy speech was on the two inter-
linked problems that face the Commonweatlh—
those of the debt and of the land. Both were treated
with quiet incisiveness and in the light of an honest
acceptance of facts, and in neither case was there
any suggestion of pessimism or cowardice in
grappling with difficulties. Speaking for the
Labor party, Watson put clearly forward the
main lines of remedial action that party proposed,
and left room for no charge of lack of definiteness.
Compared with the vague mirage which the
“Anti-Socialist” leaders evoke from the shim-
mering heat of their imagination, Watson’s
clear-cut, straightforward policy will appeal to
every class of the community, except those
selfishly interested in Tory reaction.
* * » *
In the first place, the Labor leader emphasised
the necessity for the federalisation of the
debts. It was one of the root conditions of
the union, he rightly insisted, that this conver-
sion should be effected; but it would be useless
for the Commonwealth to take over the State’s
debts and then leave them to borrow afresh.
With the assumption of existing liabilities there
would have to be a control of future borrowing.
But the limited powers granted by the Constitution
prevented any such complete settlement of the prob-
lem. Therefore there must be an amendment of the
Constitution. He was prepared to urge on Parlia-
ment during the coming session the passage of
the necessary amendments so that at the next
general elections the endorsement by Referendum
could be secured. This is the most cheerful talk
The Bulletin has heard from a responsible
leader for many a day. An evil is clearly
recognised. A simple remedy is courageously
proposed. Its prompt application is strenuously
advocated. The politician who “ recognises the
serious disadvantages,” &c., and ‘ 1 has no hesitation
in stating that steps should be taken . is a
familiar calamity in Australia as familiar as
rabbits, the drought, the fruit fly, the prickly
pear, and other pests. Also, the politician who
is “ready to take into earnest consideration the
undoubtedly weighty arguments which have been
brought under his notice ” is as prevalent as influ-
enza. But the man who, having recognised an evil,
is ready with a remedy, and ready to push on with
the remedy is, alas, a rarity. A political cancer is
usually treated as if it were something to be rather
proud'of, a matter calling for at least prolonged
consideration, and not to be attacked with any
haste. If Watson fulfils his promise and presses
on, during the coining session, a constitu-
tional amendment which will put the control of
the debt, present and future, absolutely into the
hands of the Federation, he will make history.
* * * *
Equally straightforward and resolute was the
Labor leader in discussing the evils of land mono-
poly. Until the remedy is found for that, he
insisted, a steady stream of immigration could
not be expected. Population is wanted ; he
sympathised with the cry for immigrants ; but
until the fertile and accessible lands were opened to
the people, to encourage immigration is in some
respects a foolish policy. The Commonwealth
has any amount of good land; but it is locked
against settlement. The remedy is to unlock it
with the key of progressive taxation. Explaining
that, as to the details, he represented only his own
opinion and that of the N.S.W. Labor Conference,
J. C. Watson put this forward as his idea of what
a progressive land-tax should be : On all land
under £5OOO in value, no tax. On land worth
from £5OOO to £lO,OOO, |d. in the £ on the capital
value ; the tax then to rise l<\. on every additional
£5OOO. It is necessary to calculate out this pro-
posed tax on specific estates to see its incidence.
A tax of Jd. in the £ represents £'00115625.
Not to be mean, The Bulletin would let the
land monopolist off '00015625, and leave the first
tax at £'oo1 —somewhat less than and reduce
multiples of |d. in proportion. Then the tax sug-
gested by Watson would show this result: —
To spare the feelings of the land monopolist the
painful subject is not pursued further. By this
time he would have got to the stage at which he
would be paying, on any more land that he grabbed,
2s. in the £ taxation. To own £1,000,000 worth of
land under such a system would be a surer way to
ruin than the turf.
* » * *
A progressive tax of that sort would be as logical
as it would be effective. If it is an injury—to be
met by a 35 per cent, income-tax on the land’s possi-
ble product—to hold £200,000 worth of land in a
community where thousands are hungry for a
living area, it is a crime, to be met by the total
confiscation of the land’s income, to persist in
holding half a million’s worth. Such a tax should
not stop progressing until it has reached confis-
cation. Nor, since its purpose is economic rather
than fiscal, shoulditplace any burden on the reason-
ably large landholder. An area which could bring
an income of £2OOO a year would only pay £l4O a
year in tax—much less than the rate of the exist-
ing N.S.W. land-tax. Where injustice might be
suffered would be in the cumulative effect of the
tax on city estates. A city business is conceivable
which would occupy a £lOO,OOO block of land and
yet not be a “ land monopolist,” but be using the
area to the best advantage. An “area exemp-
tion,” say, of one acre might meet that objection.
Whatever the value of an acre it would be exempt
(this, let it be clearly understood, The Bulletin
suggests only in regard to progressive land taxa-
tion definitely designed to break up big estates ;
it does not support any interference with the
general taxation of unimproved land values). With
provision against extreme taxation of citj lands
not capable of sub-division or of better utilisation,
the farthing cumulative land-tax is one which
seems to meet the case perfectly. Altogether J.
C. Watson’s was a stimulating and encouraging
speech. May he show sincerity and sturdiness in
translating it into action.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Drawing Joseph.
Crouch, M.H.R., has turned from the task of
retailing barrack-room gossip, and engaged him-
self in the humorous and, from a political point of
view, useful game of “drawing” Joseph Caßru-
THEES, the sour little insect who hums “ Federal
tyranny ” whenever he sees an indication of Lands
scandals being talked about. Joseph is a hard
badger to draw, but Crouch managed to drag him
out of his hole and speak to him. He asked
Joseph these ingenious questions:—
(1) If Dalgety is finally and permanently chosen as the
future Federal capital, will the Government of New
South Wales advise secession?
(2) If Lake George is the site permanently selected,
will that be satisfactory to the people of New South
Wales ?
(3) If neither of these sites is satisfactory, which other
one will you advise the Parliament of the Commonwealth
to accept ?
And he added —
As most of the Victorian members desire to meet New
South Wales in this matter, I would be obliged if you will
let me have an early reply.
If Joseph had any faculty of giving straight
answers to straight questions, he would have re-
plied :
(1) Yes, in the same way as we are doing now, not too
openly, but by hint, insinuation, wail, lamentation and
innuendo.
(2) No. If Lake George had been chosen the same fuss
would have been kicked up as was raised over Dalgety.
We want a quarrel somehow. The site of the quarrel is a
matter of indifference.
(3) I refuse to answer for the reason given above. I
don’t want to help the Federal Government to a decision.
So far as my personal opinion is concerned —if I allowed
myself the luxury of a personal opinion—l should favor
MonarOj the present choice, as I did before. But I don’t
want a sebtlement. I want a row.
But Joseph is not that definite sort of person and
so he replied to Crouch in a long, rambling letter
which said in effect :
(1) if. the Australian Government stands by the selec-
tion of Dalgety it will create a “ deep grievance ” in
N.S.W.
(2) N.S.W. will be satisfied with “asite selected accord-
ing to the spirit of the Constitution and agreement
understood to have been made to induce N.S. Wales to
become a party to the Federal union.”
(3) I think it can be plainly seen that it is sny duty to
advise that N.S. Wales stands committed now to any one
of the sites already mentioned, viz., Yass (including Lake
George), Lyndhurst, and Tumut, and the acceptance of
any one of these sites by the Commonwealth Parliament
will terminate the present situation.”
Here the badger is drawn. Tumut would be a
satisfactory site to N.S.W., according to Joseph,
and yet Tumut is farther away from Sydney
than Dalgety, which is objected to because
of, its remoteness from Sydney ! And then,
for the five thousandth time, we have the
foolish old gag about the “spirit of the Con-
stitution” and the disreputable old lie about


the clauses dealing with the capital having been
inserted in the Constitution “to induce N.S. W.
to become a party to the Federal Union.
N.S.W. agreed to be “a party to the Federal
Union” if its people gave a majority to that
effect, and if the majority included at least
60,000 votes. Its people gave a majority for the
original Constitution in which the capital was left,
an open question, and the majority included
21,595 votes above the 50,000 minimum. But the
N.S.W. Parliament of political frauds, spielers
and card-sharpors broke its agreement with the
other States, raised the minimum to 80,000, and
nullified the popular vote. Then the capital
clauses were inserted —not “to induce N.S.W.
to become a party to the Federal Union,'
which it had tried hard to do without any such
clauses, but to give Reid and Carruthers an
excuse for crawling round to the winning side.
They found they had quarrelled with the majority,
disfranchised it, and annulled its decision. Ihe
majority was ready to throw them out in disgust
and disgrace, at the fast-approaching State elec-
tions ; and, as even Reid could hardly turn from
Anti-Bill to Bill at a moment’s notice, he had to
get some new proviso or other inserted in the
Constitution, so that he might put it forward as an
excuse for a sudden volte face. Carruthers, with
this old tarradiddle in one hand, and his offer of
Tumut—remote Tumut—in the other, is really a
deplorable circumstance, if such a thing can be
called a circumstance.
♦
The Small Island’s Election.
Tasmania proposes to have a State election at the
end of this month, but elections attract very little
attention in the quiet island of Apple-land. Pre-
mier “Jack” Evans, one-time master mariner,
has issued his programme, which is about as dull
and colorless as himself. He proposes to start
borrowing again, and says that though “informa-
tion is being gathered on the subject of land taxa-
tion,” he does not intend to make any use of the
information, as “no change is proposed. Inci-
dentally “Jack” Evans, ex-mariner, states that
the Federal sugar bonus costs Tasmania £40,000 a
year, which, as there is no sugar bonus and never
was one, is about as outrageous a statement as
could be imagined. There is an excise duty on
sugar, part —but only part —of which is returned
if the sugar is grown by white labor ; that is to say
the sugar-grower, instead of receiving a bonus, is
the only primary producer in Australia who
pays a heavy duty. Then that very old and de-
pressed gentleman Bolton Stafford Bird, ex-
preacher, who is vaguely supposed to be some
kind of a power in Tassy politics, is running a
political side-show of his own, which side-show
consists chiefly in a lone and solitary weep about
the awful results of Federation in reducing the
State revenue. Bird, who is a lorn and desolate
creature like Mrs. Gummidge, strongly supported
Federation because it would abolish inter-State
duties, and ever since it arrived he has scraped
himself lugubriously with a potsherd because, by
abolishing inter-State duties, it deprived Tasmania
of the revenue it formerly derived from inter-
state duties. Tasmania’s revenue now is a great
deal larger than it was in 1897 or in any year
previous to 1897, and it hasn’t to pay the cost of
its post office, telegraph and telephone offices, its
defences or its Customs and Excise depart-
ments out of the larger revenue, as it had
to do, in 1897 and other pre-Federation years,
out of a smaller one—the Commonwealth
pays them. Still it is necessary for Bird to
weep ; he wouldn't be Tasmania’s broken-up poli-
tical fowl if he didn’t. The one really live circum-
stance in the election is the Labor party, which
proposes the abolition of the petrified and rather
costly Upper House, the dropping of the im-
ported State Governor as a frill that Tasmania
can’t afford, local option, free education, an in-
creased land-tax with £5OO exemption, and other
improvements. It is difficult, however, to see any
definite sign that there is a big success ahead for
Labor at the present Tasmaniau elections. Its
time will come when tie Commonwealth
graduated land-tax falls on the big landlords in
the rear, and bursts up their holdings, and makes
room for a rush of new settlers with new T ideas;
and when a real Protectionist tariff brings an
inroad of live artisans into Tasmania, and the new
men and the new ideas walks over old lugubrious
Bolton S. Bird, and . make ex-shellback Jack
Evans fly in terror to the coast and escape, and
cause Propsting to wonder what has struck him.
There is no sign of any early waking up of Tas-
mania from within ; it is too fast asleep for that.
The shock must come from outside.
Clubs.
It is difficult to fully understand the principle on
which the N.S.W. liquor law is being applied in
and around Sydney with regards to clubs. These
may be roughly divided into three categories.
The first, which calls for no consideration what-
ever, is the drinking institution pure and simple.
It has no purpose other than drinking. It doesn’t
concern itself with sport, athletics, politics, or
social amusement; it doesn’t supply meals or
sleeping accommodation ; it doesn t even supply
comfortable quarters in which its members may
lounge and gamble. It is just dingy, and it
drinks, and it exists so that its members may get
liquor after public-house hours. This kind of in-
stitution has mostly lost its license, and rightly so.
Then there is the more reputable club which pro-
vides a little sleeping accommodation, and would
just as soon that it w ; ere not used. It also supplies
meals, but it isn’t especially enthusiastic
about the meals. Also, it supplies comfortable
rooms in which its members can go in for reading,
smoking, and moderate gambling, and it sells
drink. Very often drinking and running the poker
machine are its chief occupations, hut at all
events it preserves an appearance of respecta-
bility. This kind of club is allowed in every case
to supply liquor in ordinary public house hoars,
not only'to members for their own consumption,
but to as many strangers as the members like to
shout for. A third variety of club has, in many
cases, been treated much less liberally. This is
the suburban bowling or golf club. It, as a rule,
doesn’t supply either board or residence, but its
members pursue a healthy outdoor game by
daylight, and in the evening the club rooms are
devoted to billiards, chess, cards and social
amusement. After the dinner hour the suburban
recreation club is on exactly the. same level as
the city club, except that in the city insti-
tution there may be three or four or half
a dozen members, out of a good many
hundreds, who sleep on the premises, while in
the suburban one there are not. The suburban
recreation club, as a rule, is far more sober than
the city affair, for its members do not meet droves
of their friends in the crowded street outside, and
take them in to become animated whisky vessels.
It is a respectable, homely concern which deserves
consideration. Yet, in many cases, the law shuts
up the bar of the suburban club with a slam at 5
or 5.30 or 6 p.m. The reason for this injurious
differentiation, to quote the eloquent language of
Bruce Smith, is difficult to find. The suburban
gentleman can gut liquor till a late hour in his
city club, where there is no healthy outdoor exer-
cise, and no pleasure ground. He can do the
same at the suburban pub., where again there is
no healthy outdoor exercise or pleasure garden ■
merely a parlor full of stale tobacco fumes, a
billiard-room full of ditto, and the voice of the
local hobbledehoy talking fight or horse. He is
encouraged, so far as whisky is an encouragement,
to spend his evenings at the crowded city club or
the stuffy local pub. Yet he is expressly dis-
couraged, so far as want of whisky is a discourage-
ment, from spending them in much better
society at his haunt of recreation, where he can
loaf on a picturesque bit of grass and look at the
stars. Again, why this injurious differentiation.
A United Front.
T Waddell, ex-Premier and ex-Treasurer of
N.S.W., has been making remarks about the
need for a united front. The subject about which
Twaddell desires to exhibit a united front,
instead of a disorganised back view, is the return
to the State Governments of three-fourths of the
Australian Customs and Excise revenue. It,was
provided under the Braddon clause that this
should be done for the first 10 years of Federation,
so as to make certain that the States would have
money with which to pay the interest on their
debts. At the eud of the 10 years—that is after
1911—any one of four things may happen, or may
have happened:—
(1) The States may agree to hand over their debts to
the Commonwealth, and then the Commonwealth will
keep the whole Customs and Excise revenue.
(2) There may be an amendment of the Constitution
enabling the Commonwealth to take over the State debts
whether the States agree or not, and then also the Com-
monwealth will keep the whole Customs and Excise re-
venue.
(3) In the absence of such an amendment, the States
may still cantankerously refuse to hand over their debts,
in which case the Commonwealth may do the wrong
thing, and weakly consent to extend the Braddon clause,
and continue paying over three-fourths of the Customs
and Excise revenue so that the States may meet their in-
terest.
(4) In the absence of such an amendment, the States
may still contankerously refuse to hand over their debts,
in "which case the Commonwealth may do the rignt
thing, and refuse to extend the Braddon clause for a
single day, or to pay over another copper of Customs and
Excise ; in other words, it may inform the States that
they must either hand over their debts or go bankrupt.
It is in support of proposition No. 3 that
Twaddell, ex-Premier and ex-Treasurer of
N.S.W., desires the State Premiers to exhibit a
united front. This is one of the many matters on
which a sharp line is drawn between the National
Australian party and the parochial folk who
moan and mourn about State Rights. .The
National party desires to extend in every possible
way the power and influence of the Common-
wealth, and one way to extend it is to consolidate
the State debts under Federal control, to give the
Commonwealth full charge of the tariff revenue,
to make it the sole medium of communication
between the people of Australia and their credi-
tors, and to make it solely responsible for the
payment of the interest. The State Rights
patty prefers to leave the debts in the charge qf the
State Governments and to make the Australian
Government a mere agent which has to find
the money with which to pay the interest—
in other words, to make it a tax-gatherer for
the States. Twaddei l, who was a weak-kneed
Premier, a horribly unsuccessful Treasurer, a
leader who lost the run of his party, and a hope-
less public blot generally, urges the State Premiers
to show a united front in demanding that the six
debts shall still be kept under six separate controls
in order to enhance the pomp and dignity ot the
six State Premiers of whom he used to he one but
will never be again. It is to be hoped Prime
Minister Deakin will also show a united front.
All the front of which six, or even sixty, State
Premiers are possessed can’t compel the Ummon-
weath to supply the States with money to pay
their interest bills after 1911, and if, through the
obstructiveness of the States, no arrangement is
arrived at by that year, it is the duty of the Aus-
tralian Government to lay down the alternative
that the States must cease obstructing and hand
over their debts or else go bankrupt.

N.S.W.’s £1,500,000 Loan Expenditure.
New South Walks enjoys just now the blessings
of a Liberal, Economical and Reform Govern-
ment. At least it has the Government’s assur-
ance that it is all these adjectives ; when the
Government isn’t pursuing Willis, or finding out
grievous bruises and injuries done by theLom-
monwealth on the naked form of the Ma State,
it is always assuring the public that it is Liberal
and Deform and so on. On the last day of 1' ebru-
arv this Government completed eight months ot
its financial year. Partly through good seasons
and partly through the fact that the. alleged
wreckage of N.S.W. through I ederation is a pre-
meditated lie and a silly invention, the revenue
was the largest on the State’s record—£667,693
more than it was for the corresponding period
of last year. If things continue as they are
doing, the year will show fully £1,000,000
more revenue than last year did, and the
glorious total will be about £12,500,000. The
income has increased from almost every source;
especially is it worth mentioning that the pain-
fully economical Pederal Government has returned
to N.S.W. £135,450 more in the last eight months
than in the corresponding period of the previous
year, and all the thanks it received consisted of the
curses of Joey Carruthers about its “extrava-
gance” and about the Ma State’s wrongs and
injuries. Yet, with all this stupendous increase
of revenue, Carruthers, the Economist, expects
that his borrowings for the year will be £1,500,000.
They are already well over a million, with only
two-thirds of the year gone, so they bid fair to
be more than £1,500,000. Apparently, however
much the N.S.W. State revenue swells up, the
disreputable loan policy will still go on while
there are incapables like Carruthers at the
head of affairs. Compare the financial situation
for the year which ended on 30th June, 1899, just
before the beginning of Federation, with what it
promises to be this year, judging by the figures
to date: —
Gross Revenue
(less Postal revenue,
which now goes to Loan
Commonwealth). Expenditure.
1898-99 .. .. £8,979,083 £2,025,944
Gross Revenue
at ratio of
first 8 months
of year (about).
1905-6 .. .. £12,500,000 1,500,000
It isn’t a cheering prospect. On present appear-
ances the available revenue has increased by over
£3,500,000. The expenditure which the State has
to carry has been reduced by over £900,000 since
1899, through the fact that the Commonwealth now
pays the Postal and Defence charges, while
on the other hand expenditure has been increased
by £500,000 for old age pensions. This
means, as a net result, that the State has been
relieved of £400,000 liabilities; and £400,000 less
liabilities and £3,500,000 more income should
mean £3,900,000 more available to make the
borrowing policy unnecessary. And J oey Car-
ruthers, the Economical, Liberal, and Deform
Premier, only sees his way to borrow £525,000 less
than was borrowed in 1899. At this rate it won’t
be till the State revenue is close up to £24,000,000
that the Joey Government will see its way to do
altogether without loans. When Joey Car-
ruthers conferred the blessing of his guidance on
N.S.W., in 1904, he promised, as the least of his
financin' reforms, to reduce borrowing to
£1,500,000, and spoke feelingly about leaving off the
loan curse altogether. He got £lOO,OOO increase
of revenue in his first year, and still he failed to
reduce his borrowing to £1,500,000. This year he
seems likelv to have a million increase of revenue,
and even yet he only talks of reducing loans to
£1,500,000. No wonder Joseph has to hunt hard
for imaginary bruises where the nude figure of
the Ma State has been kicked by the imaginary
feet of some alleged injurious Federal authority, in
order to draw public attention off these and other
circumstances. If there ever was a time when
N.S.W. should swear off all new borrowings by
Act of Parliament, and pay for all works out of
revenue, and also reduce its old debt a little, the
time is now.

The Telephone Tangle.
The telephones ought to be made to pay. There
is no doubt about that. They are used mainly by
one class, and if only on that account they should
be absolutely self-supporting, meeting not only
working expenses, but also interest on cost, and
providing a sinking fund. There is one large
reason why the State Treasury should not be
rifled to subsidise either the merchant or the mer-
chant’s wife who wants to gossip to the doctor’s
wife, and that is that it isn’t honest. And, any-
how, apart from that, there is in this country far
too much loafing upon the State; and it is a re-
markable fact that the crowd that snarls most
at State enterprise, and demands most fiercely
that “ private enterprise should be allowed to
do things in a business-like way, ’’ usually makes
the biggest effort to prevent things being done
in that way. Mostly this loafing on the State is
the old selfish borrowing disease in another form.
The State borrows money to build works ; and
instead of charging enough for the services
rendered to provide interest and pay for wear
and tear, three years out of five it doesn’t
charge enough even to meet interest. If
there is one department more than another
which ought to be made to pay its way and loaf
on nobody and nothing, it is the Post Office. It
isn’t like a railway, which can be said to be
developing the great natural resources; it isn’t
like the Schools, or the Defences, which are
largely a provision for the future. Yet in the
three full years in which the Commonwealth has
been running this Postal Department, and for
which accounts are issued, the revenue has fallen
short of the expenditure by £201,022. The
Federal Auditor-General does not distinguish
between the finances of the various branches
of the Department; but the heads lay an
accusing finger upon the telephones, and say
that that is one of the branches that don’t pay.
And, considering how little this country pays for
its telephone, and how much other countries pay,
there can’t be much doubt that the telephcne
branch hasn’t hitherto been a remunerative oust-
ness —in other words, that those Australians who
have used it have been receiving a subsidy from
those who haven’t used it. If definite fig •
exist on this subject of profit and loss, they ought
to be produced ; departmental officers and others
have talked gallons of loose language around
the whole matter, but avoid anything definite on
the pivotal question : Does the service at old rate,
nav’ Taking, however, their say-so that ir,
doesn’t (seeing that it is supported by reasonable
circumstantial evidence), then the Depai tmc nt
still has to explain why it doesn t put up the rates
all round. Outside some few small country towns,
the annual minimum for a new private service is
to be £6; this entitles to 750 calls in the year.
For anything over that the subscriber must pay
Ad per call. Under the present system the private
house pays £5 a year without limit to the number
of calls, and the city business house pays £J. Jsut
existing: subscribers may stay as they are. Here
then is the tariff •
Old Rate. New Rate.
Oalls (average) Calls (average)

City (business) ..9 9 9 i o
Country (priv.).. 5 6 5 4 f ]° o g lO
Country (bus.) ..8 e o 4 ' 2 .
The subscriber who cannot possibly gain under
the proposed new system is the private city.sub-
scriber ; the others may possibly gain by limiting
the number of calls. On top of all this, however,
is the “ party” system. Two or three subscribers,
using one connection, though each supplied wi i
an instrument, may get a service for as little as
£2 Bs. a year. This sort of service has, however,
disadvantages which don’t allow it to be com-
pared with the old system. But if the service, as
alleged, doesn’t pay, it isn t clear why only new
subscribers should be charged something extra.
Departmental officers say that “contracts must
be respected. ” There are no contracts beyond the
12 months. The Postal Department no more con-
tracts to supply a person with perpetual telephone
service for £5 a year than the person s( butterman
agrees to supply him with perpetual butter at 10 2 d.
a pound simply because that happens to be the
price he agreed on for this week Apart from
that defect in the new arrangement, and allowing
that experience may show the new rates eapab.o
of modification, there seems no reason to attack
the department with every available claw in the
country. The system of paying according to the
number of calls is sound and just, anyway;there
is not much better reason for a flat rate tor
telephones than for gas Propose, to the Gas U .
that everybody should have the right to turn oil
as many lights and jets as he pleases, at a uniform
rate, computed on even the present average
payment, and the answer of that commerci. I
concern run on “ business lines won t leav e
much doubt as to what it thinks about the
righteousness of persons paying according to wha„
they use.
The Eeal Obstacle.
The attempt on the part of the Freetrade press to
create a bogey of “ Socialistic legislation as an
explanation of the lack cf manufacturing enter-
prises in Australia has more than one purpose in
view It’s a lie which strikes at two parties at.
once.' Not only is the Labor party injured by
direct false accusation; the Protectionist party
is struck at by implication m the denial of its
claim that it is the absence of Protection and
not the presence of fair labor laws that makes
for unemplovment and stagnation, lhe tacts,
and the contentions involved with them, were put
very clearly recently. On the 2nd inst.. the
Sydney Hebald, commenting on the Lithgow
ronworks, said :
This morning we quote a remark of Mr. Sandfoed, who
Droooses to offer employment to some hundreds of men
almost immediately at Lithgow, and who believes the
nrosnect there would warrant the employment of
thousands There is an obstacle, however, and the
menace of Socialistic legislation and politically-dictated
industrial conditions indicate what it is.
There is the bogey triumphantly advertised.
Manufacturing enterprise is lmpossilde in Aus-
tralia because the Labor party forbids. Let local
men of enterprise and immigrant capitalists be-
ware. However promising the prospects, labor
legislation will ruin industrial undertakings. Mr.
Sandfobd, however, did not sit down under this
misrepresentation of his views. The next day he
wrote to the Hebald : ' ■
It was not Socialistic legislation I referred to as the
obstacle but the threatened policy of the Freetrade
party, it is the uncertainty of our ports being opened
for the surplus of other countries to be dumped, there,
and the manufacturers’ market crippled, as it has been m
the past. It is the uncertainty of our politicians outside
of the Labor party that I am afraid of to-day.
That puts briefly and emphatically the truth ot
the position. “ Labor legislation is never going
to keep, or drive, the manufacturer out of the held
in which Protection assures him a fair chance.
Labor legislation is designed to benefit the
laborer. It cannot do that by destroying the in-
dustry in which the laborer finds employment.
It may blunder now and again, and hamper
development a little, but mistakes are soon dis-
covered by their results, and rectified accordingly.
The main purpose it aims at ensures that amend-
ments which are shown to be necessary will be
promptly made. Under Freetrade or semi-Free-
trade rule “Labor legislation” may ruin an in-
dustry by insisting on conditions which are fair,
when foreign competition dictates that the con-
ditions must be slavish. But the remedy then is
to abolish the Freetrade, not the Labor legisla-
tion.
“ Anti-Tbibute ” writes
While fully agreeing with your correspondent (B.
22/2/’O6) as to the comparative strength of the Eurvalus
and the Powerful, and as to , the mistake of the British
Admiralty in building so many large unarniored vessels,
I cannot follow him when he goes on to speak of the
Germans leading the way in the matter of naval arnia-
ments. He says that prior to the Russo-Jap var the
standard of German battleship armament was four llin.
and ten 8 2in. guns, but no such vessels are mentioned in
the “ Naval Annual ” (1905). The latest class of German
In Hleshins referred to carry fourllin. and fourteen 6.7 in.
as the King Edward VII. class with four
Win four 9.2 in., and ten 6in. guns. The later British
vessels of the Lord Nelson class, four 12in. and ten 9.2 in.
guns must by this time be well on their way to comple-
tion and, just recently, the still more powerful Dread-
nought, armed with ten 12in. guns, was launched ; while
the German vessels with fourteen 12in. guns mentioned
by your correspondent are only projected (i.e., presuma-
bly, not even planned). . ..
As far as can be learned from official publications, the
12in gun forming the main weapon of the great majority
of British battleships, is opposed in the German Navy by
guns of 11 10.2, or 9.4 inches. The Deutchjrs have lust
realised that they have been on the wrong (Track, andin
future the 12in. gun is to be their chief weapon. The
Russo-Jap war is, of course, chiefly responsible for the
increase in the number of large guns now to be placed on
the ships of all navies.
The Americans, however, have all along used Bin. guns
on most of their battleships in conjunction with the 12 or
13 inch gun. The Oregon, which was built some yerrs
before the Spanish war, carried four ISin,, eight Bin„
and four Gin. guns, and practically all the battleships
engaged in the war had either four or eight of the Bm.
The Spreading Jap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He has hold of Honolulu,
And is spread round ’Frisco’s shores ;
And they know him in Vancouver,
Where he disembarks in scores ;
He is galvanising China,
After breaking up the Russ ;
He has mesmerised our Mother,
And is reaching out for us.
Oh, his ways are strenuous !
Such a pushful little cuss !
He has marked a place for us
In his Mongol omnibus.
Now he hopes to buy Manila
From the disillusioned Yank,
While he disciplines the Manchus
With a stern, subduing spank.
He has collared all Corea,
And, oh, shame ! this heathen man
Christian England has deputed
To protect her Hindustan.
Wriggling, worming, heathen man!
’Tis a wily guardian
Has been found for Hindustan
In this son of New Japan.
Through the Torres Strait a-swarming,
He pervades our northern shore ;
Is at home on Thursday Island,
And is settling Singapore.
Faith, our world seems topsy-turvy,
And our cup of bitters full!
He is making rings all round us,
And is giving sauce to Bull.
Yes, the Monkey has the pull,
And our bitter cup is full.
He is over-lording Bull,
Once his patron, now his tool.
O, we hail him hero, savior,
Friend, sienna-ed but sublime ;
But his name is Oily Gammon,
And he spoofs us all the time.
Too-beguiling Asiatic !
He is spying out Our land
With a smile so sweetly subtle
That we do not understand.
Ah, we may not understand
All the dodges he has planned !
He is brown, and he is bland,
But his ways are underhand.
So all-welcome, unsuspicioned,
Favored, here he comes to live ;
Almond eyes, so keenly peering,
Snub nose, brown, inquisitive.
We are treating as a brother
The most menacing of foes;
When he sets out to absorb us,
We shall know how much he knows.
Done, and turning up our toes !
We shall know just what he knows,
When our lonely inland goes
To this oiliest of foes.

their vessels would have thoug-ht possible.
The naval agreement between Britain and the Com-

Mr. David Thomatis, whose very name suggests
that he is devoted to the cultivation of edible-
fruit plants, charges the Queensland Minister of
Agriculture with an act of vandalism. Thomatis
states that he was in correspondence with the
Emperor of Abyssinia re a new kind of coffee
plant, the beans whereof are said to be 'twice as
large and rich as the Mocha variety. The
Emperor had given orders that none of the seed
of this lately-discovered Abyssinian plant should
be exported from the country, but, in considera-
tion of his having received certain cotton seeds
from Mr. Thomatis, the dusky potentate made an
exception in his case, and sent along three regis-
tered packets of the coveted coffee seed ad-
dressed to him at Cairns (Q.). These, on
arriving at the Cairns post-office, were, it
is alleged, promptly seized by the Minister
of Agriculture and destroyed. The departmental
boss didn’t trouble to communicate with the ad-
dressee. He didn’t trouble to look for any good
reason why the packets should have come all the
way from Abyssinia to a local enthusiast in plant
culture. He simply ordered the packet to be burnt.
And Mr. Thomatis further complains that he can
get no sort of apology from the authorities. This
is Mr. Thomatis’ story. Of course, it must be re-
membered that a great many strange plants have
been introduced to Australia, and Australia is now
spending vast sums in struggling with them, and
Ministers of Agriculture, especially in the land of
the prickly pear nightmare, look on packets of
strange seed with wild alarm.

N.S.W. Minister for Works Lee lately stated
that the Government would either build the
North Coast railway or go out of office. Then
N.S.W. Premier Carruthers followed him up in
haste and declined to commit himself to the work,
so the North Coast people don’t know exactly
where they are. Also Carruthers, in a foolish and
blatant sort of way, suggested, apparently as a
reason why the North Coast shouldn’t get its rail-
way, that its members are mostly hostile to him,
wherefore it appears that J. H. Carruthers
regards railways as things to buy votes with, and
considers that people who don’t vote as he wants
them to should plod as best they can along the
dirt road. Last year the Carruthers Govern-
ment proposed that this most necessary railway
should be built, half the cost being charged to
revenue ; the Bill passed its first reading, and then
the wohblesome Cabinet dropped it in the
dust-hole. Minister Lee evidently thought
Carruthers was in earnest about the measure ;
Premier Carruthers evidently knew he was not.
Yet there is no place in N.S.W. which deserves a
railway (built out of revenue) as the North Coast
does. It in dudes a great area of the richest land
in the State. It is capable of carrying a very
large population—large enough to make the line
yield excellent returns. The Sydney-Brisbane
railway is no use to it, for to reach that line it is
necessary to climb some 3000 ft. or 4000 ft. The
district is dependent on a number of petty harbors
with shifting bars. These harbors only admit
small vessels at their best, while at their worst
they admit nothing, and they are strewn with
wrecks and paved with dead men’s bones. But, .
however much the North Coast requires its rail-
way, and however profitable the line may be, the
fact remains that the fertile and neglected spot
doesn’t return members who support the Joey
Government. So what can it expect? Appa-
rently it can’t expect anything.

A cry from Melbourne :■ —
Thomas Bent, Victoria’s Minister for Railways, is liable
at any moment to fall out seriously with Thomas Tait,
Victoria’s Chief Railway Commissioner. Tait is being
blackguarded from end to end of the State. The Gem-
brook smash, with its revelation of Tait’s methods, and
the evidence which is piled up against him every day at
the friendly court of inquiry, have caused Tait to be re-
garded with disfavor. No further proof of this is
needed than the public utterances of Bent. There
is no man in Australia so quick to notice the veering
of popular opinion as Thomas the Round. So long as
Tait, because of his railway surplus, was the idol of those
who did not know the inwardness of the business, Bent
could not chant his praises in a sufficiently piercing tone.
Since then a considerable quantity of water, most Of it
rather dirty water, has flowed under the bridge. The eyes
of the public have been opened. Tait’s surplus is shown
to be made up largely of neglected repairs, unsatisfactory
services and sweating of employees. The inordinate
number of railway smashes in the last six months has
convinced everybody that something is radically wrong
in the service, and the opinion is every day becoming
stronger that that something is Tait. Bent, with his ear
strained to catch the whispers of the crowd, has heard
this, and he is already volubly denouncing Tait. Last
week he told his constituents that he could not per-
suade Tait to do anything, and explained that the
reason was because Parliament and the press had
said that there should be no political influence. This
was, of course, the old, old Thomas longing to get the
strings into his own hands again. He concluded by an-
nouncing that he meant to “speak to the authorities in
a trumpet-tongue.” The same day he lost his temper over
the matter when Prendergast and a deputation com-
plained about the sweating enforced by “this foreign
commissioner.” “It’s the commissioner wherever I go,”
burst out Tommy. “Drop the commissioner. What’s the
good of talking about the foreign commissioner. You
appointed him.” That is just the position. Bent is against
Tait now, heart and soul, and is seeking to lay the blame
for his existence on somebody else’s shoulders, a fact
which clearly shows that the public are right sick of Tait,
and that Bent knows they are.

Captain Collins, the cute gentleman who has
been appointed by the Federal Government to a
fat post in London to do nothing in particular, has
surrounded himself with a staff of almost ambas-
sadorial magnificence. He is to have two ac-
countants and two clerks—chosen by himself.
According to the Public Service Act Mr. Collins
should not have been appointed to his post with-
out a report from the Public Service Commissioner
as to the necessity of creating the position, and as
to his fitness for filling it. Neither report was
obtained. In the terms of the same Act, all these
minor appointments of officials who are going to
help Mr. Collins to put in time in London,
should be made by the Public Service Commis-
sion. They are being made by Mr. Collins.
When Mr. Collins is in question, Acts of Parlia-
ment are mere trifles. He is far above them.
The same might be said of any clever under-
secretary in the Public Service. One of the
unhappy consequences of the poor administrative
ability and the lack of attention to their work
on the part of most Australian Ministers, is
that the departmental under-secretaries can
become real bureaucrats, governing Ministers
and flouting Parliament as they choose. The
under-secretary who knows the game devotes his
chief attention to making things easy for the
Ministers with whom he deals. They are offered
the-limelight and the glory, provided they leave to
him the work and the real control. So the wise
man seeking political concessions doesn’t worry
about seeing Ministers; if he can see under-
secretaries it is far more efficacious ; and if a
smart under-secretary wants anything for him-
self not even Parliament can keep him from it.
For he is the Boss. The Minister is only the more
or less brilliant ornament who figureheads the
business.
From a Victorian patent agent:—
As attorney for an inventor, in May last year, I applied
for patents in the Commonwealth of Australia, U.S.A.,
Canada, Britain, all European countries, S’Africa and
Maoriland. Despite citations from Germany and the
U.S., causing: two months delay, every one of those
patents has been granted—except the Australian one. It
is just about time that branch of the Federal service was
wakened up a bit. The branch is undermanned, for one
thing. Officers for months past h ave been going back at
night, and working sometimes till 11 o’clock. (They get
no overtime, not even tea-money.) And still the work is
in arrears, and likely to be. Sometime last year applica-
tions for appointments as patent examiner's were called
for. Presumably there were applications, though the
Department is not likely to get much skilled pro-
fessional service for the miserable £lBO per an-
num offered. Anyhow, no change was made. Under
such circumstances things are bound to happen.
During the latter end of last Parliamentary session a Bill
amending the Patents Act was introduced. That Bill was
known to patent agents as the Patents Office Whitewash-
ing Bill, and was said to be devised to legalise certain
errors. But a nearly unanimous House tore the Bill into
small pieces, and what will happen now the Commis-
sioner of Patents would probably like to know. Meantime,
it is proposed to re-open the patents offices in the various
States for the convenience of local whose
applications number only about 5 per cent, of
the total made in the Commonwealth ; and such
a proposal will involve still more work in correspondence
and accountancy. The solution of the whole problem
lies in the amendment of the Patents Act on absolutely
United States or German lines (patents-granted by those
countries are held unassailable in every court in the
world), the proper organisation of the department, the
employment of sufficient skilled professional men at
adequate salaries, and insistance on the wholestaff having
a good deal more “ git-up-an’-git ” about it than it has at
present.

Frederic Jones, for some time past Queensland
Government Commissioner in Japan and there-
abouts, told the Tariff Commission :
The highest wages paid in the Java iron foundry at
Sourabaya were lid. per day, and the manager thereof
said that some of his mechanics could do as good work as
a first-class English mechanic. In Japan the best-paid
mechanics receive as high as lid. a day of 14 hours. The
ordinary man in the factories got from Bd. to 9d. per day
of 14 hours. Preparation was being made to introduce
Japanese boots into Australia, and the Australian artisan
could not compete against them under the present tariff.
A fixed duty was preferable to an ad valorem one, as it
did away with the possibility of fictitious-invoice
swindling.
Once more, what is the use of a 25 to 30 per cent,
tariff against the “equal of a first-class English
mechanic” working at the rate of three farthings
an hour? Are any of these Labor Freetraders
game to ask their mates to toil for that wage ?
It is cabled that in the House of Commons
Mr. Vincent, long known as a consistent Protec-
tionist, has—
introduced a Bill providing for the marking of goods
from abroad as “ foreign ” or “ imported,” and if from
the British colonies as “ colonial.”
The “ made-in-Germany ” legislation of a genera-
tion ago should have proved to British Protec-
tionists how utterly futile is any “ marking ” sys-
tem to help local industries. (There is a similar
effort on the part of Freetraders in Australia to
delude people into believing that a voluntary
movement to induce customers to give a prefer-
ence to made-in-Australia goods can act as an
effective substitute for a high tariff.) It is more
than is to be expected of human nature that men
and women will voluntarily and unanimously
refrain from patronising a foreign article when a
temporary advantage of cheapness seems to be
gained by buying it. As wel 1 expect that early clos-
ing legislation could be dispensed with by advising
the citizens not to shop after 6 p.m. The basic
idea of Protection is that it is against the common
weal for certain goods to freely enter the country.
If that is so, clearly it is the duty of the Govern-
ment to stop them from entering.

“T.F.,” on a N.S.W. land matter which has lost
itself in the wilderness—as N.S.W. land matters
seem to have a habit of doing :
“Two Seas” asks why, if the. State gets a fair rental
for the land, are men so eager to give thousands of
pounds to get a lease. Simply because a lease for a num-
ber of years without residence conditions is worth twice
as much as a tenure requiring residence. Yet both are
offered by the State at the same price per acre. The man
who has only a few improvement conditions to fulfil is in
a very different position from the man who has to make
his home from year-end to year-end in some sandy,
drought-cursed, heat-blasted waste, and should pay more.
The mere fact that men are willing to buy land from syn-
dicates at, say, Lo an acre in preference to selecting equal
land from the State at £3 shows that the selector con-
siders the residence conditions and the labor and expense
of dealing with the red tape of an ineffective, effete, and
antiquated Lands administration is worth more than the
£2 per acre difference in prices. “ Two Seas,” like many
more people, wants an inexhaustible supply of Govern-
ment land worth £5 an acre offered to him and his like
for £l. If he wants good Crown land, why doesn’t he go
to Myall Creek and select there? If he doesn’t want
good land, there are thousands of acres all over the
country available for selection at 13s. 4d. to £1 (vide the
maps of the Land Board Districts); and even these
he can get reappraised if they are not worth What he
takes them up at.
There is a great demand for land, but not for land
clogged with a heap of conditions; and that’s why people
go for syndicate land. My way out of the land difficulty
would be to only have a nominal residence condition, but
insist on the selector improving his land, and insist on
his making continuous and constant use of it. Charge a
higher figure than at present, but let the selector off the
interest each year if he is fulfilling the conditions;
claim the full amount if he is not. This would do away
with the land hunger so rife in our country districts,
where you will see a 3000-acre man, with 700 or
800 sheep and, say, 200 acres under crop, 1000 acres im-
proved, and the rest; as God made it except that it has,
perhaps, a fence round it. Yet that man will want more
land on the plea that he can’t keep enough sheep on what
he has got. He would be much better off with 1500 acres
under strict conditions as to improvements and use.
But, granting the truth of all else he says, when
“T.F.’s” reform happens along, and the only
real condition of tenure is the improvement of the
land and the constant use of it, what is to prevent
a magnificent system of land-grabbing and subse-
quent rack-renting? The reform is, not simply to
have the land used, but to assure to the man who
uses it the full reward of his labor.
4
“L. Ree” : Of all land-reform measures, nationali-
sation, single-tax, and graduated-tax, the last
scores best. It gets the advantages without the
risks of other systems. Instead of pledging the
State to Cohen to get back the land, it produces
revenue till it attains its object. It involves the
State in no risks of unpaid rents or concessions.
It does not rush on the market and pawn its sub-
stance for repurchase when land is high and
everybody is pushing the State to buy, but it
dodges quietly along and squeezes the mono-
polist most when prices are lowest and
when the landless can buy land cheapest. It
leaves the individual to settle the value
of land for use purposes, and kills specu-
lative value with a dull thud. It works all
the time when land repurchase and nationalisation
are asleep, and it operates on all monopolists,
whether their land is £lO or £1,000,000 over the
standard of comfortable living. Its tendency is
to settle on land not the social wrecks whom
Land Boards choose as State tenants because
they are “such poor devils,” but men who have
resources and who know land when they see it
outside of a flower-pot.

J. M. Barrie has been pulling the public’s
leg all his time, and in “Little Mary ” (staged at
Sydney Criterion on Saturday), he pulls it as
vigorously and as slyly as ever. The comedy has
been smugly represented as a problem play,
teaching a lesson against the British habit of
over-feeding. Barrie certainly had to hang his
remarks on to something. Even if you sell gold-
bricks and wooden hams you have to give the
public clay and timber; and the Britisher’s
alleged habit of eating to excess is simply Barrie’s
clay and timber. Instead of being a sermon on
the necessity of eating only 7oz. of steak and
onions instead of lib., Barrie’s gospel, in
fact, is that you’d better make up your
alleged mind to eat 14dwt. or so, be-
cause in the end you are pretty sure
to stretch the 14dwt. to 70z., and swear to your
friends meantime that you are simply starving
yourself, and you feel so much better for it. In
short, Barrie’s lesson is that this world is simply
slopping over with cant and humbug; that we
talk about “ Oonst’ooshnal authority,” and “ The
inalienable rights of Sovereign States ” in order to
work our own little swindles; orate solemnly
about “ The sacred rights of Property ” in order to
get ourselves passed into office and power;
look at a queen and declare that she is the
Great Force that holds the empire up, and then
promptly forget what year she died ; declare that
•‘our duty ” lies in another parish, and don’t men-
tion even to ourselves that the pay is better and
the parsonage bigger and not so damp, and less
infested with beetles; or valiantly tap our (padded)
bosoms and tell ourselves that, as to the “religion”
of our fathers, nothing but conscience could affect
that, anyway—and promptly find that the religion
of our fathers was all wrong when it stands in the
way of a crown.
* * * •
Barrie sends out a missionary to work
cures by mystic means among the Very Best
People; and she gets into the interesting house-
hold of the Countess of Plumleigh. She manages
to get them up to breakfast at 7.30 or 8 in
the morning, and introduces dinner at 2 p.m.
instead of 8 p.m.; but she doesn’t mention
that that is the remedy—these eccentricities
are simply allowed to pass as incidental to the
Mumbo jumbo treatment. Marvellous things
happen ; the household is transformed ; sighing
lovers take a new view of life ; the earl-youngster
gets to hard graft; the invalid Lady Milly dances
a cake-walk. And how ? The cure of the sick,
the change in all, are obvious. But the treat-
ment ! The missionary won’t say for a long
while. But she is young, and doesn’t know how
the public loves mystery, and delights to be hum-
bugged and to humbug itself. It is all through
“Little Mary,” she explains. And “Little
Mary ? ” “ The —the—the stomach ! ” At which
the whole household evaporates. Ridiculous !
Preposterous ! The missionary, idolised 10 minutes
before, is told that her train leaves at 6.15. Of
course shedoesn’t goby that train. Something turns
up (Lord Carlton, in this case, with an offer of
marriage) and she wins in the end. That seems,
at the moment, to jar ; one wonders if it hasn’t
been thrown in on the banal married-and-lived-
happily-ever-after principle. But it is true and
artistic enough. The truth does survive in the
last act. It does pay. When Australia was help-
ing to kill perfect strangers in S’Africa in the
interests of the Empiah, there were jeeis for the
“ pro-Boers.” But where are those pro-Boers
now—in England, in Australia? No; that con-
clusion of Barrie’s is as artistic as the rest of the
charming little comedy.
•* * * *
There is a prologue and two acts. The
prologue is the genesis of Little Mary—the back-
room of an old chemist’s shop, into which drops
Lord Carlton (Robert Brough), having a prescrip-
tion compounded. The old chemist, an Irishman
with a love for the English, is just finishing a
pamphlet, in three huge volumes, on “Howto
Cure Our Best People,” His grand-daughter
(Miss Winifred Fraser) is left to work out the cure,
with strict injunctions to do it in a mysterious
way ; and she falls in love, and lets the secret out
—when love calls, the cure of even the world’s Best
People can wait. There are half-a-dozen charm-
ing characters in the little plot; in fact, when
one reckons them up, they are all very fine
characters, perfectly drawn, most of them. True,
one might quarrel over Barrie’s doctors —the
eminent consultant and the country practitioner;
but, accepting them as Barrie presents them, they
are rich and rare portraits, and their dialogue is
clever in the extreme. And then there is that
old chemist—a fine old fellow, in spite of the rat
clattering in his garret; and seeming finer for the
admirable way in which G. B. Payne introduces
him. Robert Brough’s part suits him well, too ;
that easy, confidential manner becomes Carlton,
the good-hearted but hard-headed clubman. Yet
one can hardly single out Brough for praise ; and
when one says that, one pours praise very thick
upon a company.

The Knight-Jeffries Co. is making a pris-
matic farewell to its admiring audiences at Sydney
Palace. The white and gold and scarlet of “ The
Sign of the Cross”; the prune and puce of
bottle-nosed “David Garrick”; the tweed-
hued, snow-stormed “ Silver King,” with
its final air of domestic peace ; and after to-morrow
the last word, verily, of good-bye—“ The Lady
of Lyons” with its word-painting and brilliant
swashbucklering. The part of Wilfred Denver
gives Mr. Knight no leg-show. The omission
will be made good in “ The Lady of Lyons ”
* * * *
On Saturday next Mr. Edwin Geach
will present “West’s Pictures and theßrescians”to
Sydney. As an inducement to Sydney to take the
Presented by the hand as if it were a long-lost,
rich brother it is hereby informed that some of
the screens on which the animated pictures ani-
mate consist of 500 yards of canvas. One of the
films which shows a trip to the sun is 1300 ft. long.
Concert co. of eight star artists are all brothers
and sisters-in-law, and they are warranted (by
Mr. Geach) to give Sydney a grin that won’t
rub off.

William Anderson goes out of the operatic
business this week at Sydney Royal, and returns
on Saturday to plain, screeching melodrama with
“When London Sleeps.” The Bulletin’s
opinion of this drama is that if London knew
what things were liable to fall on its skull
as it rests on its pillow in the silent
hours it would never sleep again, or would only
do so under the protection of a strong umbrella
It is in this play that Miss Duggan escapes from
the villain on a telegraph wire, and if the
wire broke and dropped Miss Duggan on the head
of the slumbeiing city the result would be at least
one funeral.
A SHOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Holman, M.L. A., who will uphold the Socialistic end
of the argument against Mr. Reid in the forthcoming
debate, says that it will take place on April 2 and 3 or 3
and 4. The principals are to deliver three 20-minute
addresses at each other each evening. The hall has not
yet been decided upon. Mr. Holman states that Mr. Reid
suggests that each of them should issue a certain number
of tickets, but Mr. Holman favors a small charge being
made for admission to cover expenses, any surplus to be
handed over to the hospitals. Nothing will be finally
settled till the platform duellists have another conference
at the beginning of next week. —Daily Paper.
May I make a few suggestions in a most respect-
ful way
Unto Messrs. Reid and Holman in regard to this
display ?
I am certain when these orators in controversy
meet
We shall all of us regard it as an intellectual
treat.
As the First will fall on Sunday they must choose
another date
For commencing; though the First would seem
the most appropriate.
But, supposing on the Second they should first
begin to speak
Why have only two days speaking? The debate
should last a week !
I agree with Mr. Holman that there ought to be a
charge
For admission; though the entrance fee should
not be over large.
In regard to place of meeting I respectfully sug-
gest
That Her Majesty’s, the Royal, or the Town Hall
would be best.
As to prices o.f'admission, a discussion so sublime
Should be surely worth the tariff of a Christmas
pantomime ?
For the post of business manager I’m sure that no
one can
Well deny that G. L. Goodman would be just the
very man !
There, of course-, should be an orchestra to give
the matter tone
With a solo of “The Heart Bowed Down” upon
the big trombone !
This would be a fine accompaniment, most suitable
indeed
To the dismal, dark forebodings in the speech of
Mr. Reid !
And there ought to be a limelight which the best
effects would show
When he reached the peroration, standing well
within the glow !
When theatrical performances with politics are
mixed
It is just as well the “properties” should be
precisely fixed !
Messieurs Williamson and Anderson and Brough
might all agree,
With our old friend Harry Rickards, to provide,
say, two or three
Of their entertaining artists to appear at intervals
As a sort of song and chorus for the worthy
principals !
Mr. Lauri, I am certain, would the other George
delight,
Mr. Holman would appreciate the help of Julius
Knight;
And it really seems a pity, when it might have
gained renown,
That Fitzgerald Brothers’ Circus is at present out
of town!

The Miles-Stavordale quintette is still
easily first among Tivoli attractions; the effects
got out of four banjos and the accompany-
ing harp constitute the most remarkable and
artistic bit of musical trickery that has yet come
this way. The only new comers this week, to add
to what was already a good programme, are a
couple who produce sounds (more or less accu-
rately described as music) from various unex-
pected places. All that can be said for the new
people is that they get the sounds out of articles
which the long cloud of previous people hacln t
tackled. The world, however, is full of hollow
articles, so that this doesn’t count to them for very
much.

The matinee in aid of the fund that is
being raised for the family of the late Victor
Daley is to take place at Sydney Royal on the
30th, and promises to be a great success. Mr.
William Anderson generously supplies the thea-
tre, and the show will be provided by the Comic
Opera Co. and the companies from the Royal,
Criterion, and Tivoli, to say nothing of the
Brescians and others. Messrs. Geach, Geo. Lauri
and Philip Lytton are managers. A beautiful
souvenir book has been compiled by Mr. G. lay lor,
the reading matter being supplied by well-known
writers and artists, and Mr. Souter has drawn a
fine post-card portrait of the departed poet. Book
and post-card will be on sale at the matinee, and
the proceeds will go to the fund. Ihe box plan
opens at Paling’s on the 19th, and he who gets there
first gets the best seat. As to the merits of the
enterprise it should be superfluous to speak. Ihe
name of Victor Daley needs no advertisement and
his memory requires no monument.
Melbourne has warmed to the subject of
“Leah Kleschna,” in spite of the glaring defects
in that sketchy melodrama. The first act pots the
audience in a mind to be deeply impressed, and
the last act has a background that deserves the
special patronage of T. Bent. Even Bent in his
heroic young days never raised a healthier crop ot
cabbages than artist John Gordon depicts m the
vegetable garden where Miss Kleschna goes to
work. Everything in the garden is lovely,
also the absence of weeds calls for favor-
able mention. In the contemplation ■of
those cabbages one can almost forgive the
weakness of the last act. It is deplor-
ably feeble, and perhaps there would be no for-
giving it at all if it didn’t introduce a passing
reference to the fate of old Father Kleschna and
his partner Sehram. They, like Xjeah, abandoned
the profession of burglary and turned virtuous.
They fled to S’Africa, where they died fighting
for the Boers.

At Melbourne Princess’s the brief run of
Anderson’s economical panto, will terminate on
Friday. Anyone who expected a Williamson or
Musgrove production has probably suffered some
pangs of disappointment from “Sindbad, but for
them that merely look for panto, in the spirit of a
ravenously hungry citizen who seeks steak and
boiled potatoes—for them it is as good as a ban-
quet. Meynell and Gunn will bring their farcical
comedy co. to the Princess’s on Saturday, to bid
for the harmless necessary laugh with I here and
Back ” Miss Florence Lloyd, J. Dallas, and the
rest of the co. are finishing their engagement in
the comedy aforesaid, and the period of the fare-
well season is limited to 12 nights.
** * *
Meynell and Gunn, by the way, are loom-
ino' large in the land these times. On Saturday
thev produce “The Fatal Wedding” at the Mel-
bourne Royal, and for the next four weeks that
unique musical melodrama will, in the words of
the advt., “present one of the most charming
studies of child character that the stage has ever
known ” Many children, it seems, are incidental
to “The Fatal Wedding” (which possibly explains
why it is called Fatal), but there are several full-
* sized characters, and m two of these Miss May
Congdon and Charles Yane will make a first
Australian appearance.
* * * *
Meanwhile, the Bland Holt co. is playing
“The Prodigal Son” to crowded houses. Bland
has put in his usual sojourn of 50 weeks or so at
the Royal, and after Friday he will stage no more
in Melbourne until Easter of next year. There-
fore he will be expected to show himself before
the curtain on Friday and apologise for not having
appeared in “ The Prodigal Son ” Bland should
not be permitted to escape to Sydney without a
speech.

At Melbourne Opera House an Irish
Tragedian—with an accent on the “ Trag is to
make his first appearance next Saturday in an
unparalleled characterisation of Robert Emmett.
The Rickards programme is a very meritorious
collection of turns just now, but it needs this
forthcoming touch of the brogue to counter-
balance the kilts and bagpipes of the
Scottish Meisters who came to hand the
other night. Melbourne is disposed to make
much of the Meisters. Musically considered,
they are not equal to the Gotham quartet party,
and in their united effort to be funny they give
the same impression of amateurishness that is
made by all glee singers who venture into comedy.
But the composition of their “turn” is somewhat
original, and the particular McTavish who sings a
song of “Tickling” has a naughty little twinkle
in his style.
»* * *
The cleverness and fun of Leroy, Talma,
and Bosco have made a big success of the current
season at Adelaide Tivoli, and Rickards is said to
bethinking of going back to his old pohcy ot
keeping the house open continuously. -y nf y r ( ' w
Black is giving concerts at the Town Hall. -Lne
Royal still relies on animated pictures, but nas
made a hit by collecting them locally, at, the
show, Fire Brigade turn-out, &c. “bather re-
cognises John Creswell and Superintendent
Booker and chuckles ; “ Mother ” identifies our
Jimmy ”in the crowd j and there is much joy
over these little scraps of actuality.
The just-published “Harmsworth Encyclo-
paedia” knows not Joseph and his assistant N.S.
Wailers. It puts it flat that “ the capital of the
new Commonwealth is Dalgety, a township 296
miles south of Sydney, on the Snowy River.”
Another injustice to Carruthers !
The proposed Reid- Holman debate on
Socialism recalls another, in which a raging G-. H.
Reid supplied much humor, over 20 years back,
at the beginning of his wriggly career. The sub-
ject was fiscal; scene, the old Masonic Hall; Yes-
No for Freetrade, and the flowery “Davey”
Buchanan for Protection. Davey was past master
in all points, and the callow George got his first
education in the game when he arrived at the hall.
Buchanan had got there a good hour before,
had brought his fervid Protectionist followers
along with him, and had thoughtfully left space
for about as many of Reid’s followers as you might
get into a five-foot tank with tight packing. 1
Buchanan led off, and the pace was tremendous.
He boiled, and toiled, and seethed and bubbled
for an hour, and each furiously-declaimed
point was received with exultant yells that shook
the building. When Davey dropped exhausted
after a full hour’s fiery oratory, an equally ex-
hausted audience seemingly hadn’t even a croak
left. ’Twas only seemingly, however. When
Reid arose, his reception was dazzling. He
waited, for it to subside. It didn’t. He began to
speak ; but, after five minutes, the reception was
still going strong. At the end of ten minutes,
George’s reception looked like beating all records
for length and force. The quarter of an hour
mark found the reporters on the platform, their
hands on their ears, their ears half down George’s
orifice, and the; reception still going with the vim
of five Sheols. Then George sat down. The
audience unanimously agreed that there was no-
thing in his argument^.
There are heroines in plenty
WhO are purer than the snow,
There’s the artless girl of twenty
With the sweet, confiding smile.
Who never dreams of evil, and who really doesn t
know . . i , i j
That the shiny-hatted villain is a sinner black and
vile. . . .
There are heroines in gladness ;
There are heroines in grief,
Who fill the air with sadness,
And are sickly, more or less,
So a nauseated public gets a feeling of relief
When it strikes a leading lady whos a soulful
unenlightened, vulgar-minded
sort of thief, .
But a soulful, sentimental, penitential burglaress.
IN THE WASTE HOURS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
/iV a moment of abstraction, years ago, I
wrote some verses ;
They were mystical and awful, and the
meaning wasn't clear;
But the theme was frankly pagan—heathen
gods and horrid curses ;
And I read my writing over, and I felt a kind
of fear.
Then the light it flickered sadly, and the manu-
script it fluttered
To the floor, as I sat brooding in a nervous
kind of way
On the verses I had written —and the candle
sank and guttered
As the spooks of vanished lodgers blew and
puffed it in their play.
From a distance floating, floating, then a howl
like something cheated
Of its hopes of sweet salvation, froze the blood
within my veins,
And I listened for a minute ere high Heaven I
entreated
To arrange that dog's undoing and dispose of
its remains.
Silence then—the waiting silence that engenders
thoughts of sadness,
Till I caught the fleeting echo of a faint and
ghostly sound.
5 Tims a tapping, feeble tapping, and it drove me
near to madness
When the light expired so gently and-the dark-
ness closed me round.
But the tapping, soft insistent tap, tap, tapping
as of fingers
Of a patient soul and lowly, never ceased upon
my door,
VIC.
Till I muttered with a shudder, “ Oh, what
thine/ is it that lingers ! ”
And a Voice it answered, “Jimmy /” ’ Twas
a lodger, nothing more.
Straight his reason I demanded as I gulped
and tore my collar,
For his idiotic tapping, rapping, tapping soft
and low.
Thro' the gloom there came a muffled, “ Can
y' lend me half-a-dollar l ”
Which I answered in a second with a wild
indignant “No l”
Then the raider, beaten, baffled, cursed me
slowly and completely;
Cursed my hopes and cursed my person, from
my boots up to my hat.
'Twas a job of some dimensions, yet he did it
rather neatly,
For I heard him as he hissed like heaps of ser-
pents on the mat.
But I listened, listened, listened, with a feeling
near to sorrow,
To his fervent imprecations, sitting dumbly in
my chair.
Then I caught the broken sentence. “ God, how
hard it is to borrow ! ”
And I cried in anguish, “Samuel !' but the
lodger wasn't there.
After that I must have dozed upon the s fa,
hard and narrow,
'Though the pagan gods I’d slandered hung

was regarded as brilliant, and a coming great man, when
he appeared in Melbourne as an amateur Thespian in the
late 50’s. With a good stage presence and_exce lent

lacked the touch of genius necessary to
the range of a first-class stock-actor. He put in his best
work as”a principal supporter for three y^ r 3

The production of Richard Strauss’ opera, “Salome,
has caused a breach between the composer and the
Kaiser, the latter declaring that the use of such a
libretto w'as unworthy of the work. In Salome te
singers’ voices are quite subordinated to the orchestra,
and most of the time they appear to be acting in dumb
show. The orchestra is said to consist of 28 violins, 1U
violas, 10 ’cellos, eight bass fiddles, 8 drums of different
kinds, two pairs of castinets, a peal of bells, two harps,
a xylophone, tambourine, a tom-tom, triangle, and six
pairs of cymbals.
“ Brother Charles ” —one of the Anglican clergymen of

circus, I am afraid, from purely selfish motives ; I went
because I love circuses. I love the swing and go of the
whole thing ; I love the horses, the elephant and the
dog; I love the jockeys, the acrobats and the clowns ;
and —yes, lam not ashamed to own it —I loye the lady in
green'tights who gallops round the ring, poised grace-
fully on one toe on her horse’s back, holding saddle,
bridle, and whip in one hand, and blowing kisses with
the other. Ho I really mean that I still like these
things? Madam, like, is too weak a word to express the
emotions they raise in my breast—l love ’eiji.
“ Lil” : Evidently that Kenningham opera (8., 22/2/’O6)
has the inevitable colored heroine. “Kismet, or the
Cadi’s Daughter ! ” Is that the sort Of thing to create in
a land whose only cady is the variety otherwise known as
a “ tile ” or a “ lid”?
Geelong (Vic.) has a unique artist of the music-hall type
in a self-taught Australian native, with the Lyttonesque
name of Zanoni. He takes out hispocket-kmteturns to

the paint and pictures a scene. His forte seems);

«0.K.”: Reading the American notices of Nellie
Stewart as Sweet Nell, one would like to know what sor
of performance they were based upon. The history oi
Nellie’s acting of the part in Australia is a record ot cle-
terioration in the broad comedy scenes. When she maae
her first success with it at Melbourne Princess s on I'eb.
15th, 1902, which is a long time ago, the clever little
woman was trying an experiment. Up to that time sne
had been known only as a comic opera and panto, artist,
and in taking up a new line of character in a four-act
costume-play she had to triumph over the public s pre-
conceived notions of her unfitness for the work. Her first
care was to subdue her old comic-opera method, to fioici
herself in restraint, and avoid every temptation
to “ overdo it.” The restrained Nellie Stewart
took the Melbourne critics by surprise and car-
ried public approval by storm. She never before
scored so many points with so little apparent effort, inis
capital performance of a very showy part in an easily
appreciated play, made her the idol of the many-headed
public, and the undiscriminating majority began at once
to give the actress their loud applause and laughter for
her cheapest theatrical effects in emphatic declamation
and comic business. Nellie Stewart’s performance may
have improved a little for a week or two, but before the
end of the first Melbourne season of “ Sweet Nell it was
on the down grade, and each succeeding Melbourne re-
vival of the play showed a growing habit of exaggeration
in the leading lady’s work. Probably her first perform-
ance in America was a compromise not so restrained as
her Australian best, nor so over-accentuated as her Aus-
tralian worst.
Premier Kidston at Toowoomba : “Not satisfied with
their advantages of climate, &c., Toowoomba aspired to
be the cradle of the arts and sciences. If Lord Chelmsford
would visit the next Austral Festival and listen to some
fourteen bands playing ‘ The Death of Nelson, he would
not only feel poignant grief at the death of the great naval
hero, but also realise what the people of Toowoomba
suffered in the cause of art.”
George Le Brunn died in London, recently, aged 43.
He was responsible for the melody, and occasionally the
words, of hundreds of popular variety-hall ln ? lu< r'
ing 26 of Marie Lloyd’s cheekiest ditties and the best-
liked efforts of Charles Godfrey and others. Apropos, it
is mentioned that, in London, a “ really good writer o
songs for the halls receives £1 to £5 for singing rights.
Awhile back, 10s. was the maximum price for a song sold
outright. It is a common custom for composer, writer,
and singer to share any sums obtained from publication
(after the publisher has had his dip), on the ground that
success largely depends on the singer. Considering these
points, and the rapidity with which the average comic
or “ serio ” song loses its bloom of popularity, it 's not
surprising that most of the lays are slung together so
loosely. It would not pay a man to take much time over
a thing which is gone to-morrow, and isn t always here
to-day.
“ O.IL” : Reading between the lines of the San Fran-
cisco press notices, it is easily seen that the success of
“Sweet Nell” is very largely due to the completeness of
the production. An effective Nellie Stewart in the name
part goes for much, but her performance doesn t appear
so exceptionally good as the all-round quality 7 of the snow.
Theatrical art is a very secondary consideration with
travelling managers in ’Murka, and the prediction that
Musgrove from Australia would carry 7 the principal cities
by surprise is fully borne out by the critics of the first
city he struck. “ There was a warm Californian welcome
for Miss Nellie Stewart and the very excellent company
which Mr. Musgrove has brought over. No stage setting
or artistic detail from anywhere has surpassed the scenes
of ‘ Sweet Nell.’ Admirable painting, most effective use
of lights, and fine and accurate properties attest the
artistic work in Australian theatres.” The language is
slovenly—for instance, one doesn’t expect an artistic
detail from anywhere ”to surpass a whole scene from
somewhere else—but let that pass.
Amy Castles’ recent photos show that she is growing
solidly in bulk, which is a healthy sign for a singer. Most
champion vocalists get like strong men and women in a
circus. The Voice, that some people think the expression
of the soul, is a purely physical organ, and to deve.op
properly requires a lot of chest territory to back it up.
thin singer is as great a mistake as a fat poet.
A London actress, Kate Cutler, is at present performing
something of a feat. She is playing in the Spring
Chicken ” at the Gaiety, and she has a 43-minutes spell
in the course of the piece. This she utilises to do a
22-minute “ turn ” at the Palace. To accomplish this
she has a motor ’bus fitted up as a dressing-room, and she
changes her costume during the four minutes run between
the two theatres, and is ready to go on the Palace stage
on arrival. Then she gets back again into her bus, again
changes her dress, and arrives in time to resume her part
at the Gaiety. Some day that ’bus may break down and
throw an undressed actress into the street, and then there
will be a hitch at one theatre—perhaps at two.
English mail brings news of the successful production,
at the Court Theatre, London, of Professor Gilbert
Murray’s translation of the “ Electra ” of Euripides.
Murray, who was born in Sydney, is a son of the late
Terence Aubrey Murray, at one time President of the
Legislative Council. At the age of 11 he went to the
Merchant Taylors’ School, in London ; and, after a bril-
liant career at Oxford, became, at the age of 22, professor
of Greek at Glasgow University. That was about IS
years ago. His brother is now Chief Justice of Papua.
“ T.D.” : Every Australian singer in London longs for
the lost land, not so much for patriotic reasons as for the
rejuvenating effects of its climate upon the voice. Six
months of the Australian sun brightens up any voice, and
all the work that an artist does on a tour in the roo
country is the merest child’s play alongside the hurry-
scurry life of the vocalist in England, so that it means
comparative rest as well as invigorating sunshine. Ada
Crossley is said never to have sung so well as immediately 7
after her six months in Australia and S’Afnca, and not
one of the leading artists that I have heard on both sides
of the globe has shown anything like the voice to English
audiences that she demonstrated in Sy'dney or Melbourne,
where the warm sun begets temperament. If Australia
were only a fortnight’s sail away, you would find every
one of its big vocal representatives rushing there at least
once a year to g*et some of its warmth back into their
voices.
“ Edyson ” : The critics do not rage over the latest
American success, Miss Tittell Brune, as they raged over
Miss Nance O’Neil. Why is this ? How is it nobody feels
hurt, and breaks out into passionate language because
Miss Brune is doing* particularly well for manager Wil-
liamson, raking in the products of the Mint, and exciting
absurd enthusiasm in the bosoms of the sentimentalists 7
Possibly it is because Miss Brune is an absolutely
conventional actress, an intelligent performer, a fan-
imitator, but never a creator. Miss Brune acts a part
as hundreds of pretty good actresses might act it ;
Nance O’Neil could act nothing without putting a great
deal of her own individuality into it. The critics could
not remember anybody else that had done it quite like
that, and they were enraged where they should have been
o-rateful. Miss Brune and many like her occupy a position
fn dramatic art akin to that of Marie Corelli in literature.
Not one little brick that will appeal to the commonplace
mind and the shop-girl sentiment is forgotten. Even
when the curtain has gone down Miss Brune does not
cease to act. On the contrary, she acts more industri-
ously than before, and her swayings, and pantings, and
gaspings when answering a recall are in sharp contrast
to the formal response of the actress who made no bid
whatever to the fashionables, and asked to be judged only
through her art.
Thus it Sydney barrister when the Pul
Court decided that it would not receive Willis’
evidence while he stopped in Natal: “When

N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley jumped
heavily, the other day, on Police Magistrate
King for not making the fine £5O instead of £5 m
a (ertain betting case. When mere lay persons
wax erroneously wroth with magistrates for ap-
parent lenity in such cases their ignorance of the
law is a bush to hide behind, but his Honor can-
not claim that shelter. The Act under which
Magistrate King and others of his class adjudicate
makes £5 the maximum fine. If Supreme Court
,lud"es are too big to study police court law, the
Crown sho'.ld have a police court solicitor at his
Honor’s elbow on occasion of appeals.

Melbourne Marine Court elicited a strange
story regarding the grounding of the barque Win-
held a week or two ago The Winfield loaded at
Geelong and left for Melbourne. The master
himself held an exemption certificate for Port
I hillip ; but owing to a contract with some of the
shippers, he had to take a pilot aboard. In brine-!
mg the vessel to Melbourne the pilot scraped it
badly on the rocky bottom of Altoua Bay, near
Williamstown. Charged with careless navigation
he brought evidence to show that the Marine
Board had recently substituted for the old light-
ship at Point Gellibrand a floating gas-buoy with
a hulk moored close by. In certain positions, this
hulk obscured the buoy, and a red railway lidit
on the shore ivas in such a position that it could
easdy be mistaken for the buoy light. Despite
the defence, the court ordered the pilot to stand
down for 12 months.

Adelaide : “Is there never a Song of
Australia? asks “Hix” plaintively (B. l/3/’O6)
Well, there is, and under that very name-a real
patriotic ballad, beginning:
There is a land where Summer skies
Are gleaming with a thousand dyes.
It has a tuneful air, easily picked up, and each
verse ends with three whoops for “Australia,” for
the audience to join in. It was the result of a
competition 40 Wears ago, and is as well known to
all b.A. people as “Gor’save.” I have heard
audiences piayed out with it in Adelaide in place
of the other Anthem, and I have seen an Aus-

insisted on a cylinder being specially arranged

‘ ‘ General Paralysis of the Insane, ” of which

A big Melbourne business man on woman-
kind, for the edification of a Bulletin para-
graph er: “1 have ample proof that a woman
can’t keep a secret, even her own, and even
when divulging it may mean gaol. I employ
a great many girls, and now and again the
girls rob me. That is only to be expected.
But I find that when a girl steals, you
can depend upon her to tell you of it,
sooner or later. I have had many such
confessions in the course of 20 years.
The latest is the most peculiar. It is
from a girl who admits that she falsified
the accounts for over 18 months, dur-
ing which time she got away with £l4O
in_ small sums. She said she was
driven to confess because she was about
to be married, and couldn’t bear the
thought of her children ever being called
upon to share her disgrace. When the
Salvation Army was more of a novelty
such confessions were frequent, but
they were not always reliable. Con-
verts would confess sins they had never
committed, because the convert who
had not been a bad lot was considered
of no particular account. One, 1 re-
member, landed my shop-walker in a
heap of difficulties by dragging him in
as her fellow-sinner. When cornered,
the girl admitted that she had only
done those things she ought not to have
done in her own mind, but, she said,
that was just as heinous in the sight of
the Lord. I pointed out that, what-
ever sins she did in her own mind, she
had no right to go doing sins in the
shop-walker’s mind, but the point
didn’t seem to impress her.”
Missionary enterprise has to take a back
seat when it dabs against imperial politics. For
very many years British missionaries have been
explaining the gospel to the black benighted
Kaffir in South Africa, and the Kaffir has accepted
it cheerfully. In course of time nigger congrega-
tions got together, and built churches, and were
preached to by eloquent niggej preachers, and the
London Missionary Society smote itself proudly
on its own back (or if it couldn’t get far enough
round to do that it knocked its back against a
wall), and said “Well done, thou good and faith-
ful servant’’—meaning itself. Then the nigger
preacher developed a grievous tendency to argue
that as he was a brudder in the Lord, and all men
were born free and equal, and so on, his crowd
should have the same political authority as the
white men ; he began, in fact, to ask for some prac-
tical brudderhood. Whereupon the secular arm
flogged some of these brethren severely, and now
it has been decided in Natal that black preachers
must be suppressed. In pursuance of this idea a
stern law has been enacted against the building
of churches unless they are in the charge of white
clergymen who will explain to the native that he
is only a low-down, inferior brudder who mustn’t
take the Scripture too literally. Consequently
the Missionary Society doesn’t smite itself on its
own back so joyously as it did.

5 4 Melb ” : Gruesome business at St. Kilda
Cemetery. A gentleman bought a nice bit of
lymg-in ground, of virgin appearance. However, on
turmng it up two coffins were discovered. A former
official sold this ground three times over. Nothing
was easier than to give it a proper top-dressing of
lovely green turf. The horrors of pauper burial,
three or more in a grave, have often been described.
Now respectable solvent corpuses have no guaran-
tee. The St. Kilda Cemetery may be catacornbed
all over two and three deep, with an underground
dress circle, upper circle and gallery of cadavers.
Uf course the cremationists are having a jeer over
this exposure. The one reliable warranty against
being buried three in a grave is to be burned and
have no grave—only a bottle for your ashes.

Lancefield Junction and set off, on the wrong
track, down the long hill to Melbourne. Strenu-
ous but futile efforts were made to stop them
but they slithered through Sunbury, past Dig-
gers Rest and into Footscray, where a rising
grade gave a chance to slip the brakes on. The
30 miles were covered in a trifle under 40 minutes
and by the grace of God the Bendigo express had
just cleared the junction a few minutes before the
trucks whizzed by. Taking them by and large
Victoria’s railways seem to be having great luck

THE “WHISPERERS.”
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
They come in dark procession, the velvet-footed throng,
Vith eyes intent they follow, with purpose stern and
strong.
They steal from out the shadows, the quarry cannot hear;
lie feels the hated presence, his heart is green with fear.
An ever-growing army, no king their rank confers,
They are the self-elected, they are the Whisperers !
And some are bold of forehead, and some are meek and
prey,
And some are dressed in tatters, and some in fine array ;
But all have will to conquer. Few men can bid them
wait;
Their touch is law and sentence—they speak, and it is
fate.
1 know with nerves prescient and cold, fear-feeling spine
Compelling eyes are on me, and the hour that strikes is
mine.
My soul may writhe in anguish and mutely cry, what
use ?
The claw that fastens on me one power alone can loose.
With voices low encompassed, with iron thumbs bestrid,
I give the silver deener, or lend the golden quid ;
bor I am merely mortal, a god-like grace is theirs—
They are the eerie forces, they are the Whisperers !
Though death-grave are their faces and sad their eyes,
we know
Deep in their hearts, like devils, they’re laughing at our
woe.
And though the strong may palter, they know the
struggle vain,
The crown clanks on the altar ere they are free again.
The victims creep to hiding, the victors joy in pairs
They are the master demons, they are the Whisperers 1

“Red Tape, Jun. ” : N.S.W. Public Service
Board has at last gazetted its scheme of employ-
ment for junior officials. It is over a year since
appointments to the junior ranks were practically
stopped, and as the increments to the lower divi-
sions of the service go on automatically to £lOO a
year, and after that (when the hurdle of examina-
tion is successfully jumped) to £l5O, it became
evident, even to the P. S. Board, that in time the
officers appointed at £1 a week would all be
getting £3, while, as no younger men were
appointed, they would still be filling their
original £1 jobs. So the scheme alluded to
was hatched. Juniors leaving school can now
get a Government billet at 155., increasing to 255.
a week, but at the end of three years they are
liable to be shot out. They may not be shot out,
but the possibility is always there. Two rocks
loom ahead—one rock for the junior employee and
one for the Government. The current belief is
that a training in a Government office is a fatal
bar to obtaining employment outside, and a boy
can’t live for ever on the memory of his three
years’ State service. On the other hand, it takes
an earthquake to shift even an incapable hospital
attendant from the service. And when he is
shifted,, select committees, royal commissions,
departmental inquiries, and claims for com-
pensation rumble on for years. Therefore the
temporary three years’ job may be much more
permanent than it looks.

The Werribee Park (Vic.) estate, the
home of the Chirnsides for over half a century,
which Victoria has just repurchased at a cost of
over £BOO,OOO for closer settlement, has a history.
There the first volunteer encampment was held
in 1862. It was the scene of many qf the prize-,
fights of the bare-knuckle period—the fifties and
-early sixties —and Werribee Park saw the first
red deer imported. There also was the home of
the famous grey mare, Alice Hawthorn, a cham-
pion in the late fifties. Finally, Werribee Park
saw the first hare imported. Writer heard one of
the early Squires Chirnside say at a banquet that
he considered himself a benefactor of the country,
as he had imported hares at a guinea apiece. The
public does not think him so now.

more to turn the fancy of the kitchen

score of instances of servants and thrifty

A good indication of the slump in
pnblic opinion with regard to the South
African farm-burners is afforded by the
Soldiers’ Statue which is to be erected at
Ballarat (Vic.)—some time. The founda-
tion stone was laid by the Yorklet, when
out here ages ago, but was taken up as soon
as he turned his royal back on Australia, the
space being wanted for a tram-line, lhen
it was found there wasn’t enough money to
pay for a statue as originally designed, many
Jingoes who had promised bags of gold
having backed down, so a cheaper design
was obtained. Various other postpone-
ments took place, and now the miserable
image can find no rest for the sole of its
pedestal. Even the tabbies of the W.C.I.U.
arose in un-Christian anger the other day
when it was proposed that a little fountain
they had erected in Sturt-street should be
removed to make room for it, Ihe deielict
will yet find its way down to its proper
resting-place—the Chinese camp.

A Sydney publican was recently fined for
having a person found on his premises after hours
for an unlawful reason. This criminal, the pub-
lican swore, was an old man who casually assisted
in cleaning boots and knives, but the magistrate
held that the aged one did not come within the
exemption clause, and fined Bung £5. Bung ap-
pealed. His counsel argued the point before the
Full Court, and the Full Court listened languidly
until he propounded the argument that there
was no proof that the Central Police Court (where
the publican was fined) was the nearest court of
petty sessions as required by the section, Ihe
State’s lawyer admitted that the police did not
have a measuring tape on them, whereupon the
Chief Justice demanded why the court’s time was
wasted like this, and quashed the case* leaving
unsettled the point as to whether a casual old man
who cleaned boots and knives was an illegal person
to have on the premises after drinking hours. It
was in this case that the Full Court acquiesced in
counsel’s dictum that if a burglar were found in a
pub. after legitimate drinking hours, the publican
might be fined.

“Port” Stephens (N.S.W.), where the
Norwegian steamship Thordis lately piled up its
£40,000 worth of bones, is a port that is not a port.
It is not properly buoyed or marked, the channels
are more or less unknown, and the currents are
uncertain. It has been neglected for the simple
reason that there is no cause for big vessels to go
there. Yet the master of the Thordis, who had
never seen the place, chose to take his huge ship
to Port Stephens because he wanted to load a few
hundred tons of extra coal, and he could not do
this at Newcastle because his vessel drew too much
water. It was blowing hard, and on entering he
blundered into a track where there was about Bft.
of water, and as his vessel drew 21ft. things hap-
pened. An inquiry is to be held in Norway, and
when the Norsemen hear that the place is called a
port, they will probably take it as a fair sample
of Australian harbors, and say things.

There is considerable complaint about the
delay in distributing the Melbourne fund for
the relief of burnt-out settlers in Grippsland.
Mayor Weedon’s fund is over £5000; Argus and
Age funds, over £lOOO each ; altogether there
is £BOOO avail able. And Gippslanders are writing
letters to the press complaining that they are m
want of the necessaries of life. The central com-
mittee believes that these statements are without
foundation, and it won’t hurry up. It’s very hard
to divorce a committee from a fund. It begins to
look upon the fund as a prop to its self-importance
and to view disbursements with anguish.

0 Lord, great Author of all good,
Preserve us from deceitful food !
Give us this day no daily bread
Whereby the quick are changed to dead ;
And let our lives be calm and placid,
Unmarred by salicylic acid.
Lord, keep our cup of coffee free
Prom pig, disguised as chicoree,
And guard us from the human woes
Caused by arsenical glucose.
Lord, teach our stomachs and our skins
To dodge all fruit that’s dyed in tins ;
And make us wary of the shams
Which grocers vend as “ purest jams.
Let not the greenness of our peas
Be due to copper sulphate, please.
Commandments Ten the Jews have known
Since Moses wrote them on the stone,
And now the Gentiles do implore
One up-to-date Commandment more ;
Or, better still than an Eleventh,
A slight amendment of the Seventh.
More trouble comes to man and spouse
Through sickness than through broken vows ;
Moreover they can have recourse
To legal measures in divorce.
We need Thy law to daunt the sinners
Who work us evil in our dinners :
And, therefore, with uplifted hand,
We ask this simple, stern command :
“Thou”—Government of any nation —
“ Shalt not permit adulteration.”
NERVES ON FIRE.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
“Neuralgia tortured me for 17 ? “T
said Mrs. Eliza M. Be van,. Hill St., I'orbes. I
was nearly out of my mind with pain when I
started Dr. Williams’ Pink Bill for Bale People.
After the second box the Neuralgia began to ease
up, But the pain was stubborn, and it was weeks
before the pills were able to drive it clean out of
my system. I had to take seventeen boxes al*
together, but then I was cured for good. When 1
wrote to Sydney and told Dr. Williams about my
case, he said it must have been the worst case of
Neuralgia in all Australia, for he had never known
another case that needed anything like so many
boxes of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to cure it.
“Years ago my health began to break down.
I was growing weaker every month. 1 could not
keep my strength up, for I lost all a PP® t,be '
Some days I wouldn’t have a bite inside my
mouth. Other days, when I did eat a little, X
sutfered agony with Indigestion. Everything 1
swallowed seemed to lie like a ton weight on iny
chest. Eating gave me so much torture that 1
grew to hate the sight of food I got thinner and
thinner. From one week s end to another, 1 was
tired. I let myself run down to the lowest ebb.
Every scrap of strength left me. I was »s weak
as a baby. There wasn’t a month passed witho t
me having a fainting fit. If I sat down to read
for awhile, I used to feel this faintness steal g
over me. Sometimes when speaking to a friend
in the street, I had to excuse myself quickly so
that I could get away and save myself from
dropping down in a dead swoon. , .
“ When the Neuralgia was bad, a hot burning
rush of pain shot from my chin up to the crown
of my head every few minutes. The agony was
so frightful that I often had to cry out. 1
couldn’t bear the slightest touch on my face.
Every time I opened my mouth, a pain that l
could never describe darted up through my brain.
My head felt as if the top were lifting off. It
anyone came behind me and put their hands on
my chair, it sent a spasm of agony through my
face and head, far worse than if I had been burn
with a red-hot iron. No one ever had Neuralgia

I thought the terrible pain must come from my
teeth, ’’ Mrs. Bevan added. “ I must have gone
fully twenty times to have them out but the
dentist wouldn’t draw them. lam glad now that
he wouldn’t. I tried no end of liniments and
lotions, but I might as well have saved my money
for all the good they did me. At last, I tried I>r.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I took two
boxes before I could see that they were doing me
the least good—but I would have gladly taken a
dozen boxes to be one day free from the Neuralgia.
By the time I had taken seventeen boxes 1 was
back in splendid health. Dr. Williams Pmk i’dls
gave me an appetite such as I never hoped to have.
Eor three years I have not had a single sign of mj
old Neuralgia—so it is plain that when Br.
Williams’ Pink Pills cured me, they cured me for
g °“ I used to have pretty bad attacks of Quinsy
every summer.” Mrs. Bevan concluded, but
since 7 taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills I have not
had one bad attack—so they must have curec
that, too. I suppose it was my bad bl ood that
caused those gatherings in my throat, and XJr.
Williams’ Pink Pills have put my blood m a
healthy state. My health is just perfect in every

because they actually made new blood for her.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
The fact that Macrriland floated its last loan in
Melbourne is said to have seriously aggravated J. Bull,
financier. J. .Bull has .a Tot of money to fend just now,
and Seddon’s conduct in not giving him first show at a
>;ood 4 per shent shecurity has made him so truculent
that he threatens to block the renewal of the next Maori-
land loan that falls due, if this sort of business is repeated.
•-eddon s fetate* has an old £2,000,000 loan to renew in
1907, another in 1908, and one of nearly £3,000,000 in 1909;
and the borrower, when he isn’t able to pay, and wants
the P.N. renewed, is slave to the lender. If Seddon
doesn’t leave off his borrowing mania, he will be still more
<>f a slave before long. Bent, of Victoria, who has left off
new borrowings, and is preparing to pay off part of the
iiext loan that falls due and to renew the balance locally,
can scorn J. Bull, financier, but Seddon the Thriftless can
only grovel and apologise.
* * • *
Seeing that the country is solidly behind Sed-
, don, which also means behind his Fire Insurance Depart-
merit, the insurance co.’s, after 14 months’ battle, made
the best of a bad job, and abandoned their boycott.
They will accept co-insurances, but not re-insurances. In
other words, they will accept what they can get. They can’t
get re-insurances, the .department having already made
. its arrangements in London. With a view to keeping the
business in the country the Department should now see
if it can’t dispense with London in this matter.

“Policy-holder” : Who scrutineered in the
recent A.M.P. referendum on the foreign-business ques-
tion ? I don’t want to suggest that the officials were not
fair ; but I do know, from my own experience, that they
had a bad way of mistaking “No ” for “ Yes.” I sent a
proxy, with the “Yes” crossed out, in favor of late
chairman Littlejohn. Just after the first vote was
counted I got a circular signed by the Secretary telling
me that, Mr. Littlejohn having died, my proxy “ in favor
of the extension to Great Britain and the South African
colonies ” could not be used ; and another form was
enclosed. Fortunately they sent my old form back, to
furnish me with proof that it wasn’t I who had made a
mistake. Now I’m wondering hard how many “No”
Votes were counted by mistake as being “in favor of the
extension to Great Britain and the S’African colonies ”

One of Victoria’s shiftless irrigation trusts, the
Western Wimmera, has made a valiant attempt to per-
suade a,sceptical public it is doing something, by reporting
that during the last half year it used 100,009,000 cubic feet
of water to irrigate 736 acres—which equals a rainfall of
77 inches per annum ! Clearly much of this water was
wasted ; but, even if it were not, this precious trust gave
itself away by reporting that only 736 out of 900,000 acres
of irrigable land within its area were watered. This is
the trust which, in 1899, shuffled out of £183,000 of its
indebtedness of £2l2,ooo—the £183,000 the general tax-
payer has to hump. But it is evidently too tired to even
' shuffle now.

After two years of remarkable good fortune in the
matter of losses, the co. has dropped down to about its

back its loss rate was, persistently bad ; far worse than it
ought to have been considering the amount of money

The most recent figures are not altogether cheerful -
even though the profits do work out at £7 15s per
cent, on shareholders’ capital and res- rves. Net premiums
not only fail below the average—which is probably the re-
sult of the lowering of the Maoriland insurance tariff—but
the cost of getting the business has increased (which is no
doubt due to the same cause, at least 10 per cent, more
business having now to be got in M.L. to show the old
amount of premiums). For the same reason, too, a small
increase in the loss rate, computed on the basis of net
premiums, may be expected. But this increase
cannot be detected in any one year, the Stan-
dard ■ being one of the smaller, though solid
offices in which the risks are not numerous enough to
show a uniform loss rate. The co.’s earnings are as
usual among Maoriland offices, extra good ; even includ-
ing cash balances at head office and branches (£23,847)
the return on the average of the securities is 4 per cent’
arid an imperceptible fraction. The reserves now exceed
the paid capital ; and with £925,000 of capital uncalled
(they are £lO shares, and only 15s. is paid) the growth of
the reserves ought to be calculated to make the share-
holders sleep better ; .for where a co. has undertaken to
pay, say, £7,500,000 in certain circumstances, and has
only £153,000 to do it with, uncalled capital comes to
look like a very real liability.

tear account.” To some extent, therefore, the reserves
appear to be unreal; money, for instance, which has
been spent in putting down a new pipe where
there was an old one, representing so much capi-
tal, isn’t, under ordinary circumstances, a reserve
any more than a woman has a reserve of husbands
because she has married a second after burying her first.
But if the old pipe has been written down to nothing,
then when the new one is put in the co. is still a pipe to
the good, and it is a genuine enough reserve, although it
is nominally a renewal. In this case, besides the addi-
tion to this renewal and depreciation reserve, large
amounts have been provided out of profits to write down
assets ; £650, which is considerably less than usual, has
been provided in the past six months. The reserves are,
therefore, fairly solid ; that can be judged, too, by the
fact that, even after writing off £650 for wear and tear
(= 11 p.c. p.a. on fixed investments), the whole bulk of
the assets show a profit for last half year of only just
under 6J p.c. The co. has no debts, buG has £15,568 of
bank-deposit receipts.

At the end of 1904 the co. put £2OO to a reserve for
renewal of plant; but that amount does not appear in the
present- accounts, and is, therefore, treated as having
been written off during the past year—presumably spent
upon renewals. The present undivided profits include
£2OO which has been appropriated as the beginning of an
ordinary reserve fund. The co. has been 22 years in
existence; and, considering its age, its reserves are
paltry. But the position is better than it looks in this
respect. The trouble with most gas co.’s is, not simply
that they have no reserves, but that they have not re-
stored capital that has gone in rack and rust. This co.
at any rate lets us know what it does provide in this way—
something like 2J per cent, per annum on fixed invest-
ments, in addition to provision for meter renewal. For the
latter purpose £2OO was put to reserve last year ; presuma-
bly that will come off the accounts during this current year.
Assuming chat £650 (nearly 31 per cent, on all fixed assets,
lamps, meters, &c.) is a proper allowance for depreciation,
the net profits show £9 12s. on shareholders’ funds. Ex-
tensive additions to plant are said to be in progress ; the
co., it seems, will have to borrow to pay for this. It
has no bank balance, and its sundry creditors on Dec. 31
exceeded its sundry debtors by £2870.

Besides the reserves shown above, there is a marine in-
surance account of £2365, to which £420 has been added
during the half-year. Apparently, also, the usual £BBO has
been written off the value of boats out of profits. The co.
used to state what it had done in this most important
matter of depreciation throug'h bumps and barnacles * ;
but it has altered the form of its accounts and leaves the'
matter one for figuring and guesswork. The co. is
launching- out. It lately absorbed the Lane Gove
Leichhardt, and other terries ; but the present accounts
only show the deals to this extent —“ Deposit on purchase
of Ferries, £800.” The purchase price isn’t disclosed, but
whatever it is, the co. will have to mortgage itself to pay.'
At Dec. 31st its overdraft and other debts amounted to
£4920, and its liquid assets were only £2024. Still if the
new boats (including the one lately built for the co.) can
do as well as the old ones have been doing lately, and if
they, are not bought at a higher value than the old ones
stand at in the balance-sheet, the co. should do all right •
for (assuming that the boats earn everything and the
wharves and such properties nothing) these old boats
have been bringing in 12 per cent, on their book value, in
addition to paying their insurance and about another 12
per cent, for depreciation.

At the end of 1900 the mortgages amounted to £24 300 •
standing now at £20,450, they have thus been reduced by
£3850 in five years. The business shows practically no
change from the previous year; the interest bill still,
amounts to £Bl6, which is more than enough to pay 4 p.c.
on capital that is to say, the capital that hasn’t been
admittedly lost overboard. On the whole capital in the
undertaking, shareholders’and borrowed alike, the return
for the last three years has averaged £5 3s.’ per cent
without writing off anything for depreciation but
charging something like £lOOO a year for repairs and
replacements. As there is always depreciation which
can’t be covered by ordinary repair and replacement
£5 3s. per cent, isn’t very glittering, notwithstanding
that the assets were written down a few years ago to the
extent of half the capital.

As usual the figures in the last line are approximate ; and
it is really time for the society to consider whether it
can t somehow simplify its accounts, so that the share-
holder (who isn’t an accountant as a rule) may get some
fair idea as to how things are really going. At present
to arrive at profits you: find the profit and loss balance:
tnen take the previous term’s balance-sheet, and note the
reserves; add to those figures the appropriations of
profits, and see by the present balance-sheet if totals have
moved, and deduct from or add to the profit and loss
balance accordingly ; then guess how much the directors’
fees and income-tax will be ; and you don’t know for six
months how near the guess is going to be to the truth.
The result may be the net profit—it depends- upon what
sort of a guesser you are ; also it depends to some extent
upon vour stock of patience. The Society has made re-
markable progress, largely owing to the loyalty
of the shareholders and the sincerity of the officers.
Lately some changes have been made; manager
Geo. Thompson, who has had the oversight of
the concern from the time it consisted chiefly of
one bag of potatoes—that was 38 years ago —has retired.
The first half-year’s figures under the new order are
larger ; profit on stock ran to £10,376 as against £9,349 in
the corresponding half of 1904-5. No doubt additional-
profit would be welcome, in order to provide additional
reserves,; all the same, while recognising that the
reserves ought to be larger, considering that the society
has borrowed £17,360 in deposits, one can’t help sympa-
thising with the old m mager’s steadfast idea that the
prime object of the society was to provide the members
with necessaries without charging middleman’s profit on
them, and incidentally to treat the emplovees in an
exemplary fashion.

The bonus shown as paid to suppliers consists of a refund
of total commissions received from them to the extent
indicated ; and the co.’s success in the past year has been
so marked that, through co-operation, they have had
their business done for two-thirds the price originally
fixed upon as a fair thing, and have also had the
substantial advantage in price that comes of co-
operative marketing. There probably are not many of
the dairy farmers who haven’t said hard things about labor
unions and arbitration courts and “interference with the
law of supply and demand ” ; but the action of co-opera-
tive unions like this is the same sort of “interference ” with
the blessed “ law.” Yet The Bulletin can’t find in the
balance-sheet any such item as “ Bonus flung back at the
co. with scorn, .” The little co. is making excellent
headway, paying a capital dividend, building up a good
reserve, and writing off 20 per cent, per annum from
machinery and 10 pei cent, from buildings.

still they get better than bank interest, put money into '

The difference between the look of things now and a

£303.” To make the alterations in the theatre at a cost
of about £16,000 a heavy overdraft was contracted; it
now amounts to £9078, but is gradually being reduced—
at the' expense, of course, of dividends. Unfortunately
up to now this expenditure has brought in nothing extra
in the way of rent. Beyond the overdraft and petty ac-
counts (£4l) there are no debts.

Current business has given as good profit as hitherto,
but there have been further large drafts upon the
contingency reserve, established to provide for losses
on land sold on long terms ; it now stands at £1592.
On the other side are “ balances due by land purchasers
and borrowers, £26,007.” But this co.—generally known
as E. O. V. Broughton’s co.—hasn’t apparently found
much substance in the recent Sydney and suburban land
boomlet; in fact, the balances due on December 31st, 1904,
were £3910 more than they were at the close of last vear!
Every little while a large amount is liable to fall'into
profits, and be followed by a 40 or 70 per cent, dividend ;
but as that is the result of profits which have been kept
in suspense pending final realisation, in connection with
the time-payment land business, and as there apparently
hasn’t been much of that business lately, the prospects of
early and frequent windfalls of the 40 or 70 per cent, sort
are not bright. In fact, instead of unexpected gains, the
institution is having at present a run of unexpected,
losses. The co. holds £16,520 on deposit, an increase of
£1769 during the 12 months ; but, borrowings on mortgage
have been reduced from £BlB9 to £4427.

Ore reserves of Fingall Consols (W.A.) on Dee.
31 were estimated at 753,000 toils, worth 555. 6d. per ton.
This meant three years’ supply at present rate of con-
sumption. But shareholders are now told that the future
monthly production will be only £45,000. This means
that ore is worth only 455. a ton ; it also means a profit,
exclusive of depreciation and London exes., of £24,000
only. A year ago the output was £60,000 and the profit
£40,000. On Dec. 31, 1904, reserves were put at 621,000
tons, valued at 87s. a ton. Six months later C. M. Rolker
-estimated-them at 635,000 tons worth 765., while Manager
Lovell made the figures 657,000 tons worth 795. It will
be seen that the tonnage has been creeping up, and the
grade of ore and profits falling rapidly! .The div. will,
have to be reduced to ss. a quarter, and even that will he
a tight fit, as it means £250,000 yearly out of a mine profit
of £288,000, leaving very little for management and
unforeseen expenses.

Associated, Kalgoorlie, has. found a new make
of ore m the Oroya shoot at No. 10 level. A vertical bore
sunk in the west crosscut, after passing through 7ft. of a
floor of country rock, penetrated 14ft. of ore averaging
25dwt. Similar floors occur in the Northern, and that
was why manager Rodda said long ago that the bottom
was out of the mine. This present pipe is 70ft. wide and
40ft. high in places, but carries bands of mullock: and
these make it difficult to define the lode. Associated
shareholders may yet be rewarded for their patience
which has been sorely tried through mismanagement-
before the days of G. M. Roberts, that is.
* * ’* *
Brown Hill Extended, Kalgoorlie, started the
new main shaft last June, and it is already down 700 ft.
This shows an average of 80ft. a month, including stop-
pages to put up surface tackle. The requisite 800 ft.
should be reached in April. This shaft is being put down
to work the two eastern lodes on the property. Prom
No. 1 lode, from a drive 6ft. wide by 200 ft. long, a test
crushing, some time ago, yielded 141dwt. per ton for 126
tons. Prom No. 2 lode, 224 tons yielded 18dwt. per ton.
The lode was driven on for 174 ft., averaging 3ft. wide.
There is still a good quantity of fair ore left in the Brown
Hill shoot on the north-west corner of the property, and
this will be treated on the mine. Management intends to
erect a plant whenever the reserves in the eastern lodes
warrant Co. is still fairly well off financially.
Boulder Main Reef, which has been under a
cloud since it paid its last div. in 1901, may yet come
again, as a development at 1550 ft. level, 260 ft. south of
Great Boulder boundary, is panning out all right. For
the first 7ft. of the north drive the lode runs 42in. wide
and is worth 64dwt. The ore shows telluride and free
gold. Co. must, however, be getting pretty short of
cash. It was reconstructed a year ago in 260,000 shares
of ss. each, credited as paid to 35., leaving an assessment
of 2s - ° f this amount, Is. per share, or £13,000, was
called up. After paying debts, only £5732 was left; but
in August, 1905, co. sold the old twice-treated tailings for
£6OOO, which served to keep developments going. It is
nevertheless, practically certain that the remaining Is!
per share will now be called up.
* • * *
Boulder Perseverance has had no luck so far
with its eastern boundary lode. It has been penetrated
at 1100 ft. and 1300 ft., and a connection by winze has been
made with the point where it was cut at the Associated’s
1200 ft. level. Although the lode is 35ft. wide and highly
mineralised, it carries very low values so far. The shoot
at 1200 ft. looks as if it dipped south, and may be found
by driving south at 1300 ft. and north at 1100 ft. The
alterations to the furnaces are being pushed on with in
rotation, and the output will be gradually increased up
to 16,000 tons monthly. The mine is opening up well at
the lower levels, where there was supposed to be no pay
ore when Klug took charge, and reserves are gaining on
the mill.. a

Fingall Associated, Day Dawn (W.A.), which
The Bulletin reviled when it was floated two years ago,
and also since, has been resurrected as Great Pingall

worth snapping it would have been snapped by 8.,M. and

Westralia Mt. Morgans, which only resumed
operations after the holidays, is again stranded. Why
won’t A. E. Morgans learn modern methods-of mining?
He argues that it is useless to sample, and has fallen in
every time. This slipshod method landed Sons of Gwalia
m the soup, and will land every other mine having the
erratic lodes of W.A., where it is impossible to judge
values except by constant assays. Nicolson, of Ivanhoe
told Morgans so last June, when he reported on the
property, but Morgans said that sampling was all rot, or
words to that effect. But he will have to admit he is
wrong, or lose his money, and close down the mine for
good till some wiser person comes along.
Fenian, Meekathara (W.A.), still goes strong
During February it treated 444 tons for 23220 z. ; total
since May, 951 tons for 47720 z. Main shaft, down to 150 ft
vertical, passed through the reef at 60ft. ; it was there
4ft. wide. The shoot so far has been proved to be 250 ft.
in length, and the returns prove its high value. Mine’s
future looks bright. In fact, the district appears to be
one of the best of the Murchison fields.
* * * *
Victory United, Cuddingwara (W.A.), con-
tinues to have fairly good crushings of small tonnage •
but the reef is too small to be of much account. The last
return of 2440 z. from 178 tons is up to the average. A
new air compressor is expected to start in April when
sinking the main shaft below 640 ft. will be resumed.

Queen Margaret, Bulong (W.A.), had a fairly
good half-year, the Queen Margaret showing a profit of
£5300, and the South Gippsland of £9OO. Nearly all the
profit of the former mine was earned in November and
December from the rich patch at 700 ft. As this has now
cut out, prospects can’t be called encouraging. The
South Gippsland yield has been falling off and was only
1690 z. in January against 411 oz. in October. Therefore
the mine at present must be working at a loss. Chair-
man Harvey Patterson told shareholders that the shaft
was to be sunk to 1000 ft., and levels driven at 800 900
and 1000 ft. Possibly; still former manager Bill Hender-
son reckoned that shaft was not safe, and did not sink a
foot all the time he was in charge.

As Great Ophir, Davyhurst (W.A.), has been
quoted occasionally of late, investors should know that
co. is in 300,000 shares of ss. each (170,000 paid and
130,000 con.), of which 2s. is called up. What is the
actual position of the co. it is impossible to say, as those
responsible give very little information. The mine is
good but the management crude, and the treatment plant
(Krom rolls with direct cyanidation) has proved a failure
for this ore. Additional treatment plant has long been
threatened, but from shortness of funds, or some other
cause, has not arrived. Co. was reconstructed in August
but no information was forthcoming as to the result. ’

Sons of Erin, Paddy Higgins’ new find at
Higginsville (W.A.), is turning out satisfactorily. In
driving 1 at 80ft. the reef has averaged about 2oz. for 2ft
wide, chiefly fine gold ; but a very rich patch carrying
coarser gold was later on met, and a few bags full of stuff
are reckoned to be worth £lOOO.

Broken Hill North new co. begins its financial
management badly by reckoning the premiums from the
new share issue asprofit, and treating it as such, instead of
as some sort of reserve fund ; with the result that by-and-
bye, the amount will probably be paid away in dividends
That is to say, dividends will be paid out of capital. The
half-year really showed up as follows :

habit of charging- all manner of mine work to capital
account; so .that .of ,tfie £10,2,42 written off only £4482 is

the same plan were adopted now the half-year’s profit

The fires in the B.H. Prop, and the Junction
are still smouldering, and the one in the big m
giving trouble. In this section there is mole than the
average forest of Oregon timber, and the pyroligne
gas generated by the slow combustion of this wood drove
the men out of the mine early this .week. Whereupon
down flopped shares, which had just had a remvety
on heavy London buying, to the tune of °OO.
It is disappointing, of course, that the Me IS
moving downwards (where it can do most damage ,
but the position is stiil largely misunderstood.
General Manager Delprat, when he found he could
not grapple with the outbreak instantly, started to
sink three winzes from the 300 ft. level right over the fire
area, intending to flood it out. It was necessary to g
down in each Shaft close Upon 100 ft,; and that isn t a
matter of 24 hours or even three days. This work is now
nearly completed. The plans for fighting the fire have
not failed, for the simple reason that they are not yet
complete. As for the mine workings being filled witn
gas, it sounds alarming, but it doesn’t necessarily' mean
that the fire is any worse. It is mostly a matter ot
atmospheric conditions. Cloud, rain, and a heavy atmos-
phere keep the fumes down ; and that is what took
place early in the week.

When the small party that owned the Lance-
field (W.A.) sold that mine to 8., M. and Co., two ot
them, Horton and A. W. Freeman, after looking around
N.S.W. and Queensland for another show, picked up the
Harden, at Harden (N.S.W.), and, under agreement with
the men who had been fossicking in it, formed a Sydney
co. in 50,000 shares to work it. Freeman, who had been
through Sydney University mining school, was put in
charge, ran up a 10-head mill, followed it with a cy'amde
plant, and meantime did more development at 80ft. and
also continued the shaft. Result gives hope of a mine
with a life of some years. There is a rufi Of ore about
400 ft. long—really two makes—which will probably
average 3ft. The extraction so far has been a good
deal short of the reported assays ; latter were stated at
about loz. sdwt. ; the battery finds only about 12dwt.,
with say another 4dwt. waiting for the cyanide, Last two
months’battery yield—Jan. : 458 tons, 2820 z. 5 Feb. . 4,50
tons, 2450 z. Total since the co. started, 1591 tons for
9S6oz.—a shade over 12dwt. Practically there were three
working months last half-year, and they' showed a piofit
of about £270 a month; present profit should run to
about £4OO. On the surface the mine is not enticing ;it
runs east and west, is in granite, and shows no outcrop ;
but a profit of £4OO a month, earned with a second-hand
mill and an engine that seems to have been washed up
from the Ark, is a good set-off to jnany prejudices.
The 0.5. A., Cobar, gamble is just where it was ;
and The Bulletin’s theory still stands—that the rich
stuff on which shares boomed to £8 10s. was a shallow
zone of secondary enrichment, the result of the leaching*
out of the metal from the stone down to water level. On
the results of two borings shares are now at 30s. Plats
for two more bores are now ready. Those already drilled
haven’t by any' means settled the fate of the mine ; there
may still’ be profit in it. But they prove, anyhow, the
serious tailing-off of values below the level on which all
the development has been done, +

The N.S.W. crowd that snorts at labor conditions
for mining lands is for the moment between the devil and
the deep. “ How ’’—this crowd asks—“ how can you
expect people to put money into mining when you make
their ground liable to forfeiture if they don’t work it for
some, no doubt, perfectly good reason ? It s monstrous,
and a gross interference with private enterprise. And
now, up at Burraga. there’s Hockey’s M.C.P., which
Lloyd’s Co. wants. If it could get that
ground the old mine might keep at work for
years ; without it, it announces that it must shut down,
and most of its hands have been sacked already. The
Hockey trustees will neither work the land themselves
nor let the Lloy'd’s people have it on terms which the
latter deem the only possible ones ; so there are ructions,
and the very crowd’that has denounced labor conditions
is calling for an amendment of the law' to make owners of
the M.C.P.’s work their ground. When, in short, labor
conditions were called for by working' miners, they weie
a monstrous thing ; but when they are called for by a big
English co., which finds itself in a corner because the
labor conditions don’t tread on a neighbor’s toes heavily
enough—well, it’s a different matter altogether.

The alleged syndicate which (so it was said a
year ago) was to operate on a large scale about Emma-
ville (N S.W.) seems to have died or fallen asleep or gone
to S’Africa. Although it secured the right to prospect
and w T ork the mineral lands on Strathbogie, held privately',
and also applied for other blocks belonging to the State,
nothing has been done, not even on the lands where
certain conditions are supposed to be fulfilled. The
principal mover in the Strathbogie sy'ndicate was a
Hebrew, of Sydney, who was in one of the good things
near Emmaville in the earl.v days ; but the real bonanzas
were all situated within five or six miles of the town.
And anyhow, there are no bonanzas now ; tin ore is hard
to get and it is only the high price which prevents an
exodus. Much of w'hat is got is coming from old ground
in the hands of foreign co.’s which take 10 per cent,
royalty. #
Prentice and Southern, Rutherglen (Vic.), is in
a parlous state. Co., three years back, was offered
capital by a Bull crowd, thought to be allied with
Bewick Moreing and Co., which was to get a half interest
and sink a third shaft. Money offered was not reckoned
enough, and the big holders didn’t want anything of
Bull,"so they shelved the proposal. Co. now learns,
through deep ground having been met going up the lead,
that it must get lower ; so the shaft is to be sunk 40ft.,
and a new main level driven 1500 ft., w'hich will bring gold
production to a standstill for 12. months. Henry Gore
and his crowd advocated the British deal, and are, of
c urse, cock-a-whoop. But there isn’t much reason for
thinking, if the other Bull shows in the State
are anv guide, that the result would have been
different, from a mining standpoint, supposing the claim
had been handed over to Bull and his engineers.
Luck has been against the Prentice and Southern
in cutting deep ground up the lead where natu-
rally thev expected to find the gutter shallow. Fact is,
co. ‘is draining half the country side with its pumps.
Minister McLeod should alter the law, and compel co.’s
•which are saved calls by the pumping of.their neighbors to
contribute to the cost of the work. It might be best to-
day for the Prentice and Southern to cut a level along-
side the lead in order to find out the extent of the crab
hole. If it is not big, there would be no need to deepen
the shaft just yet ; though this must be done when the
co. comes to work down the lead. Question that ought
to be answered is whether the board was ever advised of
the need to have the shaft sunk during Visick’s manage-
ment or before. If it was, why didn’t it carry out the
work then ?
Another Butherglen deep lead straggler is the
.Great Northern Extended Consols; and apparently for
the same reason. Co. is one of the old boom floats.
If situation counts for anything, it ought to head the list
of the producers in the district. Water, however, proved
as tough a job as to the old North Prentice, and
to the Southern and Prentice. So it happens
that, exclusive of a State loan of £3500, over
£90,000 in calls and gold have gone into the mine. Where
the fault lay was—(l) In not putting up a better class of
plant, and (2) in not sinking the shaft deep enough.
Browne, the present manager, found the l,nder-
crushing so badly for want of backs that he had " ,
a new main level outside the gutter. Th > s stO PP®“
development, and so the mine to-day has very htt
cut up and drained, Pretty well the whole of the
gold comes from off the No, 3 rise, where the run of good
wash is over 300 ft, wide, In the south end the dirt w
poor, and only the most careful management savestne
co. from calls. If Browne got a decent run of gold south
his uneasiness would disappear. Shareholders will have
to wait to see how No. 3 rise south turns out. Even it m
doesn’t open up well, so little has been done on the claim
that shareholders ought not to lose heart. Gt. Southern
was as badly off, but it came out on the r, &ht side, ana
the bores away further south give every reason to thum
that good ground exists there.

struggling co, like the West Berry Consols then was. But
he is more likely to hear some tall talk about the baling

easy condition that the cost is to be . for

Overdraft has been wiped out, and the co. is in

through ; iif "should return between £7OOO. and £BOOO.
Shareholders were rude enough to inquire about a divi-
dend. A director suggested paying one in three weeks ,
hut the chairman said within six months. Go. pushed
out a crosscut 60ft.,.and met 15in of stone coming from
the Phoebe. It is the correct reef this time, as a rise 128 ft.
long has holed through to the Phoebe workings ; so the
boundary is close. Levels from the crosscut are out 183 ft.
to the west, showing 18in. of stone; and there in
average of 6in. in the eastern drive, which is out 88ft.
Show looks well; hut more development is needed to
prove Kelly’s to be anything a one-hhtse affair.

before the courts and punished for squandering the means
of the widow and orphan, unknown numbers escape, by
making some wretched and ineffectual attempts at
restitution.' In all history there is no greater or more,
horrible tragedy than that of the widow a nd orphans
suddenly reduced to abject poverty through a careless
or dishonest trustee. The usual procedure has been for a
man to toil and deny himself and thereby ac “ a
sufficient to keep his wife and children in comparative
comfort. It is always the life-long friend who is appointed
trustee, because the wife is so ignorant of business. A
the life-long friend gets into difficulties, and gambling
with the money of the widow and the orphani drag, them
down with himself. Sometimes, it is not even dishonesty,

“J.X.L.” : I agree with “War E.’ (B.
8/2/06) as to the value of the rabbit industry.
±Sut what does that count for when there is taken
into consideration the losses sustained yearly by
bunny ? JNot only is the carrying capacity of the
land greatly reduced, but in this (Bland) district
and, 1 suppose, in many others, there are hun-
dreds of pounds’ worth of stock lost yearly, either
by eating the poisoned rabbits, or by picking up
the poisoned baits. And the wheat eaten this
year, around this part by the rabbits would pay
for a new war vessel. With “WarE”lquite
believe the only solution of the rabbit problem is
closer settlement and wire netting, and keep the
rv/PJf 6 specialist as far away as he is at present.
uu • j ts all we argue for; and then the
rabbit industry can go on being an industry until
there are no rabbits left. But if disease-poisoning
is started, the industry will be killed and the pest
won’t.—Ed. B.j

A HAPPY PARTING.
PERCY FROM 'OME (having landed hard): "Bub-lub-by Jove! I'm dud-dooced glad to be
wid of the fellow."
Something has been heard, like a hoarse
whisper of despair, about one of Queensland’s
Uut Beyond missing mailmen a race of
people whose movements, through blistering
heat, and overwhelming floods, have been sadly
disorganised of late. The police went out
after the lost mailman, but found only the
horseiess buggy and an empty whisky bottle.
1 hey followed his tracks for days, but in vain
and then went back to Charleville. Now a voice
comes from a point near the S.A. border saying
that he had turned up at a lonely station outpost,
half-starved, and more than half-crazy. He
rested a while ; then started up nervously and
said he would get further out-out into the
Northern Territory—“No man’s land”—where
many fugitives had preceded him from time to
time, most likely to perish. The criminal of Far
Western Queensland, and the crazed and sun-
struck person who is pursued by strange animals
coming up at him from the east, generally walk
out over the Edge never to return, and the mail-
man was last seen making for the Edge, and
talking to himself as he went.
VERE DE VERE.

“ Huflin-Guffiin ” : He she-shearers I
knew one, once, in N.S.W. She shore her hus-

tallies at surrounding stations. She could do her
ou a day, I have heard, but have no proof how-
ever. She was fed mostly on boiled wheat and
sugar when growing up. Her father carted fire-
wood into our township, and had a composite team
of horse and bullock—bullock in shafts and horse
leading. The lady cut the wood. When she
married, she took things easily for a while, but the
desire for the strenuous life returned, and she
drifted into shearing, ploughing, sheep-killing,
and other violent proceedings.

“D.A.D. ” (Grenfell): During recent
bush fires here there were witnessed some very
ugly “ whirlblasts ” or whatever they might be
called. One of these came out of the fire area
carrying three-foot pieces of lighted saplings'
&c., and tore along for two miles, distributing its
flaming burden, and setting alight the grass all
the way. Not much chance fighting that ; we
might as well hit an active volcano with a cow-
hide. One of them burst with a terrific noise that
was heard five miles off. Cause of burst unknown,
but it is said they generate some kind of gas as
they whirl along.
“Corax” (to “ W.P.8.” in B. l/3/’06.) :
that tarantula was probably not dead until you
officiated with the stick. He had most likely
been made insensible by being stung through the
cerebral ganglion, and was going to be stored as
commissariat for the future larvse of the wasp.
Creatures thus rendered insensible do not decay,
as would, of course, be the case were they killed
outright. I have frequently seen a hornet thus
dragging off towards its nest a comatose locust
(cicada), the big wasp progressing with difficulty
by the use of his wings, and thus “skidding”
along the ground.

“ Old Camp ” : A good many years ago, a
party of diggers on a N.S.W. goldfield bottomed
a duffer at 90ft., and deter-
mined to “work the oracle.”
They circulated a report
that they had struck good
prospects, but, being anxious
to go to S’Africa, where
wealth, they were assured,
awaited them, they were
anxious to sell out. A specu-
lator accordingly entered into
negotiations for purchase,
and stipulated that he would
descend the shaft alone to
take for testing a sample of
the wash. ISfow, the nearest
water to the claim was half -
a-mile away, and to this one
of the diggers hurriedly re-
paired. He cleared from
about the place every stick
but one, which had a crook
that nicely fitted the hand.
Into the end of this he put
sdwt. of shotty gold, which
he covered over with puddled
clay, and then placed the
stick conveniently beside the
waterhole. The sample of
wash was duly obtained and
conveyed (as expected by the
diggers) to the waterhole in
question, where naturally the
handy stick was used to
puddle the bucket of stuff,
from which the speculator,
of course, got the sdwt. of
planted gold. Then he
promptly closed at the price
asked, and a jollification en-
sued, after which the party
of miners unostentatiously
departed. The purchaser of
the claim never obtained a color
from it.
“TheProoshan ” : The wombat is a curse.
He burrows under miners’ water-races for the
sake of a “ soft dig,” and so lets the water of the
diggers escape. He worries graziers by tearing
great holes in the wire-netting fences, and lets in,
besides his own ugly carcase, the illimitable cara-
van of rabbit. A friend of mine is trying to bust
Mr. Wombat up with dynamite. A plug is fas-
tened to a long pole with about a yard attach-
ment of fuse. The hole of the ’bat is closed with
earth (loose), and, on the fuse being lighted, the
charge is rammed home through the dirt at the
end of the pole, and man retires. Presently a
boom and then profound silence, which betokens
either dead wombat or absent wombat and shock-
ing waste of good dynamite.
“ Dave Richards ” : I have been travelling,
and my batch of Bulletins lias just caught me
up. In one of them (8/2/’OG) I notice “Caber”
inquiring in an injured tone of . shout what make
of ancient history I liave been supplying them
with, anent wheat and other cereal cultivation in
the place the other side of the next whirlwind.
Well, it is not ancient history at all, and the
whole occurrence can be verified by reference to
the gentleman mentioned in my par at the address
there, given. “Caber” says: “Sometimes it
doesn’t count two straws in what manner a crop
of wheat is cared for.” That is a misapprehen-
sion. It always counts at least three straws. A
man can always increase his chances of a good
crop by a little care ; and even in the' worst cases
raise some sort of a crop—though if the season is
disastrously droughty he will certainly not have
put it in at all, if he knows anything of crops. I
was not speaking of cultivating in phenomenal
droughts. As for turning in sheep to eat the
young crop off two or three times in succession,
upon which I laid such stress, and which “ Caber ”
so much objects to, the great desideratum in
wheat or other grain-growing, in climates where
the rainfall is not too copious, is to have'the roots
of the crop strong, so that they will not shrivel
up should a short spell of dry weather ensue, but
will be able to draw out what moisture there is in
the ground and so survive between showers-. In
any sort of a fair season outback there are always
storms and scuds enough to grow a crop, two or
three storms of any volume at all being amply
sufficient. It is only in very bad droughts that
there is no rain at all in the cereal-growing season.
As for “Caber’s” remark about everything de-
pending on Providence, it puts me in mind of
Carruthers lying on a feather-bed and allowing
this blessed country to be run by Providence and
land agents.

“ Sunny Jim” : A friend of mine scoffs at
the notion that sharks can pace it with steamers.
He lives at Mosman and gives, as the result of
observations made on his daily trips across, the
average pace of a shark as four miles an hour. I
can’t personally confute him, so perhaps some
better-informed person will help. [Depends upon
what shark and what steamer. The white shark
of the Atlantic has apparently no trouble with
15 knots, and some of his rushes must far exceed
that. Pour miles an hour is certainly a ridiculous
estimate of any shark’s speed, if the animal was
trying to hurry. Even the slowest freight shark
can beat that, while the express shark would beat
it several times over.—Ed. B.]

“ Arnold ” :• Recently saw, on Lake Wen-
douree, Ballarat, a curious battle between a fox-
terrier and a swan. As the dog swam up he got a
dab on the ear. That astonished him, and after
vainly trying—on account of the swan’s long
reach—to get to close quarters, he put about and
made for land ; whereupon the swan put' him
under water. When he rose again his fighting
days were over.
THE VOICE OF THE TEMPTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the valley of the Moonbi, where the rich green crops
are swaying
As the breath of soft, warm breezes flutter gently over-
head,
Jock McLachlan tilled his, acres (and the crops were more
than paying)
I'rom the first grey dawn of morning till the sun was
setting red.
Jock McLachlan was a pious Highland Scot, and conscien-
tious,
And was prone to subtle argument on Calvinistio law ■
He was keen on points of doctrine that were knottv and
contentious,
And, in matters theological, was quick to find a flaw.
Thus he lived and throve, contented, on the product of
his labor,
In rural peace and happiness among his fellow-men,
T * bo h earke ned to temptation, in the person of a neigh--
And was basely made a victim to the arts of Peter Henn.
Peter Henn, throughout his lifetime, had been oft con-
strained to suffer—
P,ol law he Pe, ' SeVerin “ meddlln S' of the minions of the
He was known throughout the district as a noted cattle-
duffer,
And had filled, at sundry intervals, the prison’s hungrv
maw. /
At the peaceful hour of twilight, through the slip-rails he
came riding,
And accosted Jock McLachlan with a soft, engagin''
smile; e "
And his guise was that of friendship, and his manner was
' confiding,
Though his brain was busy hatching out a sinful scheme,
of guile.
And he told, in husky whispers, what he had in con-
templation—
How he wished that night to slaughter one of Patrick
Ryan’s steers,
And he chained his victim’s conscience in the shackles of
temptation,
And instilled his oral poison into Jock McLachlan ’s ears.
And McLachlan sat and listened to the plan communi-
cated, ,
For the price of beef was heavy, and the times were more
than hard,
And he felt his inward Mentor, in a measure, was nla
cated
By the side of beef Henn offered, just to use his killing
yard. ”
Peter laughed at Jock’s reflections on the prospect of
detection,
And he swore ’twas just as easy as an infant’s idle play •
All he needed was the killing yard that joined his own
selection,
And he’d leave the beef, all ready, on McLachlan’s bul-
lock dray.
Then McLachlan’s rigid conscience took a holiday and left
him
At the mercy of the tempter, and the devil scored a win
For the honeyed words of Peter’s specious argument be’
reft him
Of desire to keep his feet from out the downward paths of
sin.
When the dawn had flushed the sky-line, Jock McLachlan
hied him gaily
To the yard upon the river, where the killing-gallows
lay >
But his feelings overpowered him when he saw the head
of Snaily,
His especial pride of heifers, lying gory on the dray.
And there the hide of Snaily', showing plain the JM
branding,
And the half of Snaily’s carcase met his horror-stricken
gaze ;
Then it burst upon McLachlan with the light of under-
standing,
That a policy of honesty’s the only one that pays.
Is it strange that Jock McLachlan is a cvnic, sour and
bitter ?
Can you wonder if he’s doubtful of the faith of fellow
men ?
If within his eyes the gleams of cold suspicion ever
. glitter,
And his heart is filled with fury when he thinks of Peter
Henn ?

The bush fires in Beech Forest wiped out
one of the finest natural curiosities in Victoria—
the giant gum-tree stump which served as grand-
stand at Beech Forest racecourse. It was about
30ft. high, with steps leading up and a railing all
round. It accommodated comfortably ail the
aristocracy of the club, and its loss is rnuch
lamented. Hopetoun, when Governor of Vic-
toria, performed the opening ceremony, for even a
stump must be “opened ’ in this much-governored
country, and there was a dance on the stump, at
which Hopey did the first set with the wife ot a
forest pioneer for a partner. The bandstand on
that occasion was a big blackwood stump along-
side, and on the top thereof a couple of fiddlers
made shrieky music for the dance. Ihe club will
now, presumably, have to nail together the usual
ramshackle board edifice to accommodate the
local nobility when the noble animal rushes round
the track on high days and holidays.

Near Clunes (Vic.), the other day, some
boys discovered a dog at the mouth of an old
shaft. The dog had about its neck a rope to
which a brick was attached, and the brick was
hanging in the shaft. The dog must have been
struggling for some time to drag the brick out of
the mine, for the rope had worn a deep cut m the
back of its neck, and one ear was severed. Ihe
boys rescued the dog, and that night one of them,
explaining the matter to his parents, remarked
casually that there were funny noises coming up
the shaft. This set the lad's father thinking, and
further remarks induced him to organise a party
and visit the place. There were certainly funny
noises, and a miner, investigating on the end of a
rope, discovered a man in the last stage of exhaus-
tion in the water at the bottom of the shaft, cling-
ing to the slabs to keep himself afloat. He had
taken his dog to the shaft, intending to throw it
down, and had fallen down himself. When the
rescue party reached the shaft it found that the
dog had returned there, and was crouching at the
mouth, howling dismally. There’s nothing mean
about a dog like that.

“ Roma ” : Gippsland is a land of strange
anomalies. It has either too much water or none
at all. I spent six months there last year, and the
deluge in Noah’s time was a trifle to the water
that roared and rolled and tumbled down the
gullies and creeks right up to December. T here
was no spring till a few weeks before Xmas. Now
the local butter factory is closed for want of water,
and the precious fluid that 1 couldn’t dodge for six
months is being sold at Gd. a bucket, and even
more in some parts. It would pay to store water
in some way before next season. If I could come
across anyone in funds to go partners I’d start a
miniature reservoir. I’ve got Gd. leftover from
last pay day.
BAD TIMES IN THE BUSH.
“Dave H.R.” : The aborigines of Aus-
tralia appear to have either a respect or a sym-
pathy for lunacy. An insane blackfellow is prac-
tically the pet of all in the camp. They
will give him anything he desires without a
murmur, and will even surrender their food to
him. I have seen a mad blackfellow walk up and
possess himself of another blackfellow’s outfit-
boomerangs, spears, and other weapons, as well
as his ’possum-rugs —without any sign of objection
on the part of the robbed party. The other blacks
made the loss up to him each one contributing
something. I once knew a mad blackfellow,
whose lunacy, at times, 'took queer forms. He
would go down on all fours, and moving thus down
the river bank would declare : “ Mine yarraman ”
(horse). Then he would drink after the manner
of a horse, and, when he had finished, would
walk in, and either dive or walk across the
bottom—nq mere being seen of him till he emerged
like a bunyip on the other side.
THE MARCH OF THE MOTOR.
OLD STUMPJACK : “ And did ye cotch the dingo this morning ?
PINT-POT SAM: “ No , the daw slost the scent, and picked up the trail of a durned motor-

“The Prooshan” : Be “Falder’s” women
scrub-cutters. They are no great novelty. I
once knew ; two sisters, aged 22 and 24, who grafted
like good’uns in Tumbarumba (N.S.W.) district.
On one occasion the elder took a contract to scrub
50 acres for a cocky, and sub-let the contract, or
what remained of it, after a week, to her sister, m
order to attend to a little business matter in Wagga.
The business was her marriage with a young
farmer, who, dazzled with the swing she got on to
her axe, popped the question what time the fair
but hot Venus leaned back against a stump to fix
up her coil of hair with a splinter. Those girls
had corns on their hands fit to make buggy
brakes out of, and used to take oatmeal water into
the scrub in a billy for drinking purposes. They
reckoned the raw water made them “weak
inside.” They could drive bullocks, fence, split,
grub, scrub, or harvest. What jewels of wives
they’d make to husbands with that tired feeling !

“ Drifter ” : Watched a lyre-bird courtship
in a Blue Mountain (N.S.W.) gully recently.
Was planted among the ferns waiting
for a shot at a wallaby, and had an
uninterrupted view of the birds in a
small clearing. The mean-looking hen
bird was a veritable queen of coquetry.
Whilst the splendid male preened his
noble tail to her gaze and filled the
gullv with clear, passionate love notes,
she "disdainfully went on scratching
for worms among the dead leaves.
Now and again he would spring down,
in desperation at her coldness, and
chase her round the clearing, clucking
tenderly and whistling till the bush
rang with melody. Then he would
again spring on a log, strut and preen,
and commence mimicking the different
birds for her delectation. The black
magpie, coachwhip, king parrot and
thrush he imitated with wonderful
fidelity, but with a much clearer and
sweeter note. For over half-an-hour I
watched the little comedy, then, sud-
denly, the serenader appeared to lose
patience and chased the distracting
coquette till both disappeared noisily
among the bracken down by the stream.

“Hexham : Be women shearers (B.
l/2/’O6). In Argentina they are to be found at
nearly every shearing, and at small stations are
often more numerous than men. They have nearly
always three or four kids in tow and an infant
at breast, and, having besides to serve mate twice
or thrice a day for the unmarried husband and his
friends, two dozen sheep is a great record for
them. The tucker for the family is, in fact, more
what they look at than the pay—4s. to 7s. per
100. They are much better hands at maize gather-
ing than at shearing. I knew an Irishwoman
who, working with a rum bottle alongside of her,
gathered 24 bushels of clean corn (husk left on
stalk there) a day in 35-bushels-an-acre corn,
which is reckoned exceptionally fast work.
In the Darling Ranges, the fashionable
country retreat for the wealthy people of Perth
(W. A.), some of the oldest and best orchards and
orange groves are leased to Chinamen. One of
these properties is owned by Sep. Burt, K.C.,
once Attorney-General in Bigjohn s Ministry, and
a member of the Six Families. Another is the
property of Colonel Haynes, a good old crusted
Groper, who much prefers the Chow to the man
from N.S.W. or Victoria. Now, Chinamen are
admittedly good vegetable growers, but they are
clean out of it as orchardists, and as they make no
pretensions to a knowledge of fruit growing, it is
difficult to understand why they should be pre-
ferred in that line to skilled Europeans. Recently
it was discovered that, notwithstanding the des-
perate attempts made to keep out fruit from the
Eastern States (because, it was alleged, the codlin
moth was unknown in Westralia, and the pest was
allegedly rampant “ over there ”), a number of the
oldest W.A. orchards were badly infected. Great
alarm was caused, and the West Australian sent
a man out to explore, and this is what he wrote
(17/2/’O6): —
Complaint was made by some orchardists that several
of the gardens in the district were not cleaned up as they
sifould be to avoid harboring and encouraging various
pests. In this respect the Chinese growers were particu-
larly referred to. “ A Chinaman can grow vegetables all
right,” declared one irate grower, “ but he’s no good in
an orchard.”
Any small struggling European fruit-grower
would have had his trees cut down and reduced to
ashes under these circumstances, but to do such a
thing to Burt and Haynes’ plague spots is out of
the question.

that Trust could, of course, invest in U.S. A. loan stock
(of which there is not much in the market). (3) The post-
office, the arsenals, agricultural bureaux, the Panama
Canal and a few other enterprises are Socialist under-
takings of the U.S. A. Government. Broadly speaking,
there is very little State Socialism under the United
States Government, but a strong and growing party is in
favor of an extension of State and municipal enterprise.
(4) Generally, the Great Powers are inclined to Socialism
rather than private enterprise ; this is so of France,
Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Japan:
“ private enterprise ” is more favored in Great Britain
and the United States. (5) All- the “individualist”

LATE EDITOR. HADDON, OF THE
“ARGUS.”
A Brisbane pressman bad the watch on
Justice Real the other day in a Full Court case.
During the first hour he talked for 25 minutes;
out of the second hour he occupied 20 minutes ;
third, ten minutes. In the afternoon ne inci-
dentally mentioned that his throat was rusty.
I here was, as a result, a marked improvement in
the rapidity of business. Quite recently before
this Judge a barrister rose to proceed with his
case. Before the first sentence was half finished
Justice Real broke in and spoke. After he had
been going 25 minutes he paused and asked to be
excused for interrupting. As a lawyer, however,
he has no peer on the Queensland Bench. If he
only had C. J. Cooper’s patience! Real cannot
hide his feelings.
Heroism shone brightly in the murk of the
Long Tunnel (Vic.) incline shaft, the other day.
A shot was to be fired, and when the fuse was
lighted the miners jumped on the skip and sig-
nalled to be hauled up. After running up 10ft.
or so the skip left the rails, and threw the men off"
The lights went out. Patrick Kearnan was
jambed between the skip and the timbers, and
fatally injured. Jens Nelson extricated him, and,
when warned by another mate to look out for the
shot, replied, “ I’ve a man here, and can’t leave
him. I’ll take my chance.” He took it, crouch-
ing to shield his wounded mate with his own
body, and when the charge exploded was much
knocked about by a fusillade of rocks. Kearnan
died a little later.
Some of the people who
went under at the recent
British elections were more
or less distantly related to
Australia. Rupert Guin-
ness, of the great porter
firm, and cousin of N.S.W.
Chief Justice Barley, failed
badly at Haggerston, which
is practically another name
for Shoreditch, in the north
of London. Haggerston is
near Hoxton, and they are
both close to Aldgate and
Bishopsgate-street Within,
and not very far from Step-
ney. The best that can be
said for all these localities
is that they are a good dis-
tance from the Elephant
and Castle, and from the
Bricklayers Arms railway
station, and are not beastly
adjacent to Peck ham Rye.
Two years ago Rupert Guin-
ness commenced his canvass
in the Unionist interest—he
had then just married a
daughter of ex-Governor
Onslow of Maoriland. In
order to get at the great
heart of the people, and
pose as genuine members of
the working classes, he and
his wife lived and spent
their honeymoon in the
awful district of Haggers-
ton, beside Shoreditch, close
to Hoxton, among people
who Struggled through "on 12s. a week, and
were wildly affluent on 18s. But the
genuine Labor candidate beat Rupert Guinness
very badly, and then the rich member of the firm
which makes porter gave up pretending to be a
working man, and fled disgustedly out of Hagger-
ston, which is near Hackney and not far from
Homerton, to say nothing of the fact that it is
convenient to Bethnal Green, and commands a
distant view ot Holloway.
Nib : Late editor F. W. Haddon was a
man with remarkable physical gifts. After 31
years of night work in Melbourne Argus office,
He looked as fresh as an English farmer. The
enduring pressman is usually spare and wiry.
Haddon was fleshy, his figure resembling that of
O lief Justice Madden. He was a great trencher-
man and blessed with an equable frame of mind.
All the same, the stout person rarely makes very
ancient bones. He does not see 90.
W. A. M Arthur, M.P., who although
13 years Liberal Whip and an office-holder under
Gladstone and Rosebery, is not among the
Gampbell-Bannerman crowd, explains that he
was offered a Cabinet position, but declined.
, e eminent. Wesleyan ” asserts that he was
also offered a title, but preferred to remain “a
plain business man.” W.A. is a Sydney native,
and m respect of titles differs from his North of
Ireiand relative, W.. MMillan, head of the
M Arthur house in Australia.
A fearfully persistent woman has been
pervading the Melbourne police courts since
December, 02. In that month her husband, a
lawyers clerk, was ordered to pay her 10s. a
week maintenance; and, though he seldom lets
his payments get more than a month in arrear, she
has during the three years issued 92 summonses
against him. A woman like that, with the
persistence of a bull-ant, is wasted as a grass-
widow. She ought to be given charge of the
land-tax department.
Colquhoun, to whom the Queensland Chief
Justice, the other day, handed out 15 years’ gaol
is, at 44 a relic of that notorious Melbourne
W included “Buck” Milledge and
Guriy Carroll, afterwards hanged in
oydney for shooting a constable. On
Gup day, ’94, this gang broke into Berry’s
warehouse in Spencer-street, and stole
i/000 worth of tobacco. Six weeks later
Colquhoun was arrested and given 12
months for horse-stealing, and was no
sooner m Pentridge than he told all he
knew about the Berry tobacco robbery,
with the result that he and four others
were tried, convicted, and sentenced to
mrig terms therefor. But in less than a
week Colquhoun was released the
authorities not desiring a murder in
the gaol—and packed out of the country.
But he got off at Westralia, and drifted
back, and has spent most of his time
since in one gaol or another.
“Father” Watsford, the oldest Methodist
Minister in Australia, paid a visit to the Methodist
Conference m York-street, Sydney, last week and
was enthusiastically received. Mr. Watsford is a
native of New South Wales, though he has been
long resided in Victoria, and is running well up
to his JOth year. He, was one of the first six day-
schokrs who went to King’s School, Parramatta,
in 1832. The elder Watsford ran coaches from
feydney to Parramatta, his head quarters being
the old Globe Tavern at the corner of Market and
Gastlereagh-street. That is over three-quarters of
a century ago.
“ U.” writes :
Melbourne Argus, eulogising the late F. W. Haddon
Tv! 1 ? !?,! red fr ° m it® editorial chair in 1898, says he held
that there should be no flinching from the expression of
strong views when required, but never an unfair blow.”
A fine theory, but why isn’t the Argus run on these
, the lasfc ,,, few years its unfairness
has steaddy increased. For a specific instance, take
its treatment of Dr. Maloney when he dared to oppose
Malcolm McEacharn for the Melbourne Federal, seat
especially during the period between the first and second
ballots. The foul abuse and baseless allegations printed
in the Argus at that time might well have been penned
by some gloating person in the office of a Sunday gutter
no P a P ei ' th;lt prides itself on'fairness
should have published such stuff. And instances of simi-
lar unfairness abound in the alleged model of journalistic
rectitude. J

The reason I did not draw the man attention to the fact that he had

Over here
in Westralia you strike
men who have had all
sorts of bumps. Came
lately on one settled in
Fremantle, J. C. Jar-
dine— related to the
family of Jardine-
Mathesons, Calcutta
merchants. This Jar-
dine got away to sea at
12, and has been through
four shipwrecks, mostly
sensational. Thrown
ashore in S’Africa he
joined Carrington’s
mounted troopers, and
roughed it among the
Pondos and other na-
tives ; then, after an-
other wreck or two, he
volunteered on board
the Peruvian ironclad
Huascar in the war with
Chili. This war saw the
first practical test of tor-
pedoes. The Huascar
was supplied with
several. One of the first
used was discharged
against a Chilian vessel
huggingthe coast in shallow water. It went off with
a splutter; but, after travelling a couple of hundred
yards, turned right round and made straight for
the Huascar. A Peruvian officer, Lieut. Palacio,
plunged in, met the torpedo and directed its
course. Palacio was killed in the next fight, when
J ardme was taken prisoner.
Frederick Spencer Oakes, a man with
some interesting ancestors, died on Saturday at
Randwick, aged 47 years. His grandfather,
r rancis Oakes, was chief constable of Parra-
matta in the early days, and his mother was a ,
daughter of Sergeant Small, who came out with
I hillip m the first fleet. Francis Oakes the first
arrived originally as one of a band of missionaries
sent to spread the Light at Tahiti, but the natives
drove them off, and coming to N.S. Wales they
took up various occupations—police duty among
the rest. Francis Oakes No. 2, son of the mis-
sionary constable and father of the Oakes just
deceased, was a member of the Legislature for
many years, and was the first man killed on the
Sydney tramways. He was standing at the
intersection of King and Elizabeth streets when
he was run down.
“Lii ” : Be the proposed statue to Joseph
Banks (B. 22/2/’O6). Eighteenth century satirist,
Peter Pindar ” Wolcot, records a Banks utter-
ance that might be inscribed on the pedestal—
k leas are not lobsters, d n their souls ! ”
The line occurs in an ode on “Sir Joseph Banks
and the Boiled Fleas.” Peter asserts that Banks
was “ the most accomplished swearer of the Royal
Society, ’ but his communications to that scientific
body were so infrequent that some members started
to opine that he should be asked to resign the
position of Dresident. Banks, put on his mettle,
determined.to discover something. At last, “he
told an intimate friend that he had made a dis-
covery that would astonish the world, enrich the
journals, and render himself immortal” ; he was
upon the eve of jjroving that the common flea was
a variety of lobster. He boiled 1500 fleas, but not
one changed color as its supposed relative would
under the same conditions. Still, Banks was
resolved to make a discovery, so he gravely in-
formed the society that he had proved beyond
doubt that “fleas are not lobsters.” This was so
satisfactory that he was kept in office as president
tor 41 years.
Vic. Premier Bent and Water Commissioner
Swinburne are often seen together, and about
Melbourne they are known as “ Wind and Water.”
Balfour owed his defeat at Manchester in
part to a placard headed “ The Thieves’ Kitchen ’
showing how his grandfather made £300,000 in
three years at Madras, as a navy and army con-
tractor. It was a poor kind of gibe, though. The
Vxiad,stone fortune was largely made out of slaves
and yet Balfour’s opponents still regard Glad!
stone as some kind of a god.
“Hist”: The unfriendliness of late Jas.
Bonwick to John Pascoe Fawkner arose from the
latter s hatred of Bon wick’s hero, John Batman.
Bonwick once told present writer, in tones of
suppressed wrath, that Fawkner carried "his
enmity to his rival pioneer to the extent of assert-
ing that he died of a loathsome disease contracted
rom Australian blacks.
Joseph Creer, N.S.W. ex-Labor Bureau
keeper, tells this yarn of a pressman now basking
m the sunshine of success :
I twigged him at once, though he fondly thought he

Apropos a certain insolvent tailor and his
customers. Some years ago, Sydney had a fashion-
able tailor who gave unlimited credit to fashion-
able people, and so long-winded were these
fashionable people that periodically the tailor
either assigned his estate or went into the insol-
vency court-under the old law. He always paid
JUs. in the £, and only adopted this method to
make his protracted customers pay up without
personal dunning on his part. On one occasion, a
-J ustice (now dead) of the Supreme Court appeared
in the schedule, and when the official assignee
called upon him to pay up something like £BO, his
Honor was bitterly indignant, and spoke about
contempt of court and other things. Neverthe-
less, his Honor paid for his honorable “clobber”
in the end.
, , Vihiniy Bent, councillor of Brighton and
Moorabbm, is thinking of leaving in a huff in the
|?, terests °f 1 horn as Bent, Premier of Victoria.
due to the action of other councillors
oi Moorabbm, who sit round Councillor Bent and
abuse Premier Bent in his hearing. They talk
s relight at lommy about Thomas, all because he
will not give them more railways and roads and
bridges than they have accommodation for.
As Councillor Bent cannot defend the absent Pre-
mier he feels his position keenly. He says that
either lommy or Thomas will have to resign, and
thebettiiig is all on Tommy. One can sympathise
with Tommy. It must be very trying to have to
sit still while the man you love and honor above
all others is being traduced by common coun-
cillors.

About an aged banker :
After 46 years of service Mr. .Tames William Holmes,
sub-manager at the Sydney office, retires from the
service of the Bank of 'New South Wales. His
memory goes a long way back. In the late fifties
the bank kept bad hours and often didn’t go
home till morning, the officials struggling with their
cash and documents till 1 a.m. or later. Old pictures
show two shops between the Bank of N.S.W. and the
Commercial Banking Company. One of these was occu-
pied by S. Hoffnung and Co., “fancy warehouse,” the
other by W. G. Sprigg and Co., importers, W. C. Preston
draper, and E. Haviland, photographer. These were
afterwards acquired, one by each bank, while the Bank of
New South Wales also purchased a store at the rear occu-
pied by Kirchner and Co., general merchants. Apropos
the Bank of New South Wales had its first office in
Macquarie Place, in a house the property of the historic
Mrs. Peibv, about whom there has been so much confused
legend. That was in 1817. In 1823 the business was
transferred to George-street, on the site of the old
“Thistle Inn,” where in the early part of last century
beer was sold by James Chisholm. The inn stood where
Bradley’s auction rooms now are. When the old Barrack
Square ground was disposed of the bank purchased the
corner of Wvnyard-street and George-street and in 1853
built there, and the business is there still. In late years
“ Jimmy ” Holmes gave some of the officials much con-
cern. He wouldn’t brush his clothes, and he had an
affection for ancient garments ; and he persisted in going
out into the parks at lunch-time with his pipe and
colloguing with “dossers.”
Ex-Judge Foster, of N.S.W., treasures in
his suburban home the despatch box which his
grandfather used in the old Irish Parliament that
sat in Dublin before the union. His grandfather
was Speaker in those days.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Interviewed on his retirement, announced for
April next, John Roberts placed among 1 his best per-
formances a break of 821 against Duncan at Glasgow, in
January last year—the highest break yet made under
billiard Association rules. He thought the best thing he
. ever did was 119 consecutive losing hazards on a standard
table at London Egyptian Hall in 1889. His biggest break
of 1392 was the record for the spot-barred game, and his
record for rapid scoring was 1000 in 49 minutes. As this
was spot and push barred, he considered it equal to
a similar score in a game played under present Billiard
, Association rules. Roberts, aged 09, has been playing in
public fop 40 years. At 19 he defeated his father by 79
points in a game of 400 Up. At 20 he won his first big
handicap. Just then his father was smarting under
defeat from William Cook, sen., in the first game ever
, played for the championship. Two months later
his son avenged him, and for 30 years John
Roberts, jun., was supreme in British billiards. He
, was four times beaten for the championship (once by
Bennett, thrice by Cook), hut after each defeat quickly
regained the title. Since 1874 he has not been beaten in
a championship match, nor in any game upon level terms
since 1875, though he met and defeated every challenger
till five years ago. His last championship performance
was to beat C. Dawson by 1814 points in IS,OOO in 1899.
Ex-Premier Balfour and “ many other leading sports-
men ” are supporting a proposed national testimonial to
Roberts, who intends to g'o in for teaching, and also for
superintending big billiard saloons, which he means to
establish in various parts of Britain.

“Suss” : Par. re Haclcenschmidt (B. l/2/’OG) is
incorrect. The big fellow hasn’t got miner s elbow at
all, though he was operated on for something like it when
in Sydney over a year ago. Hack, could not meet
Madralli because he had wrenched his arm m a fool
wrestle at one of the halls. He will wrestle Madralli
soon however. It must be remembered that Haeken-
schmidt is not at his best yet. He is only 27 years of age,
and is improving every year. It is too early to look on
him as a scar that is waning. In a letter to a Melbourne
pressman, a week ago, Hackenschmidt, referring to
Scott, the Maoriland champion, said he was willing
to put up £5OO to £5O that he would throw Scott ten
times in one hour. The fact is tnat Munro. Cameron, and
all these alleged champions, are not in the same street
with Hackenschmidt. He takes 13, 20, or 40 minutes to
throw them perhaps, but then Hack, is a showman as
well as a wrestler, and he is a good enough showman to
always give people their money’s worth. In this connec-
tion it is worth while mentioning that, according to the
Daily Mail, a London wrestler named Gus Rennert chal-
lenged Hack, at the Bristol Empire some time ago.
Hack, wrestled him, but failed to throw him in the stipu-
lated 10 minutes. Whereupon 10 golden so vs. were
counted out to the Londoner. Hack, was too much ex-
hausted to continue the struggle. Has anyone in Bal-
main, or Geelong, or Humpybong, ever heard of Gus
Rennert, thfe Londoner, and has anyone at the Tivoli, or
the Opera House ever seen Hack, throw him? Oh, yes,
Hackenschmidt is a showman all the time. But he is the
world’s champion wrestler, too.
There are over 1000 racing cyclists affiliated
with N.S.W. League of Wheelmen alone, and the conse-
quence is that there are too many in the game for the
amount of prize monev. A list of the season’s winnings
shows that, apart from the lucky winners of big
events, the amount of money to be captured by
the average pedal-pusher at the game is under £5O,
while scores and scores of them get nothing
hut bills for training expenses. As it is impossible
for the professional cyclist to do anything else during the
six months season by which to pay exes and crust money,
the question arises: “How do they do it?” Obviously
the trade and the promoters are carrying the expense of
maintaining a small army of riders whose presence is
necessary to give the business at least the appearance ot
a gamble.
Somebody wants to know how to identify the
driver of a motor car that knocks you into the gutter and
whizzes off at 40 miles an hour. And the answer is
“ Dunno ! ” Every country where motoring has become
at all a popular amusement has struck the same problem,
and for a time in France the country people went about
armed, scanned the roads carefully before crossing, and
took pot-shots at flying motorists. The only morsel of
comfort is the fact that in the long run the scorch-
ing motorist generally gets killed himself. When-
ever you read of a sad occurrence “in.which Mr. Dash,
well-known in motoring circles as a daring driver,
came to a terrible end on Saturday, through rushing into
Mr. Farmer’s dun spotted bull while travelling at a rate
of 40 miles an hour,” do not sympathise. Just
whoop ! It is just the case of a man who has
probably run down half-a-dozen innocent persons
without being identified, meeting the fate he earned.
Germany has now legislated making motorists respon-
sible for the maintenance of people they injure, and also
their dependents. In the event of death, the widow is a
perpetual charge on the motorist, whiph will probably
conduce to the establishment of a widow-killing industry,

Hitherto when the racing cyeflist has fallen he
has mostly had to lie helpless, like the ancient in
armor, till relief came. This was due to the w a ? J” 8 f ®® "
were strapped to the pedals, and there are occasions when
it is to the advantage of the man who has come down to
get out of the way of the fellow who is scorching behind.
Some grimly humorous incidents have been seen on racing
tracks, when to avoid being run over the fallen men
have crawled rapidly off the track, dragging t ,
machines at their feet behind’them. The nec y
this gymnastic performance has now been obviated y
the invention of a strap which will slip right off the pedal
if it is jerked sideways. It is on the principal of the
modern stirrup leather, and remains firm as a rock as
long as the pedal is used in the ordinary manner. The
net result will be the saving of a lot of contusions. There
is something very objectionable about a fall at any time,
.but when a 12st. brute ,and a 301 b. machine ride oyer one s
neck after he has been dragged along the track it makes
a fall just plain unadulterated Beelzebub.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
My Dear Arinj,—
i Sydney, March 13, 1906.
In the rush of Enacdotes from many pens and
papers nary a mention is made that the Princess
Ena is pretty. A few looks in a royal girl go a
very long way, and what would be just prettiness
m Miss Jean Bull becomes absolute beauty in a
royal personage. So probably Ena’s fair hair and
complexion are her principal points. Emily Sol-
dene says she isn’t slender, but rather the reverse,
and in the snapshots of her she doesn’t seem to
have any neck. When a girl can have a thousand
necklaces it’s an awful pity for her not to have a
nice long neck. Her protile is very like that of
Ada Crosslev.
One of the snapshots shows Ena coming out of
the Protestant Church at Biarritz” after Sunday
service. As the “shot” is barely six weeks old,
and as Ena has been under instruction for a
change to the R.C. faith for some months, it’s evi-
dent she hadn’t quite seen what she now calls the
“error of her old ways” six weeks ago.
lalking of brides, I have been looking at the
picture in a weekly of a smart Melbourne bride
(Miss Frankie Oliver). It is hard to guess her
Jooks or figure, because of the profuse and rich
accessories, and the artful posing by the camera
man. There is a leafy pillared background, and
scaled against it a glorious eight-foot woman,
draped and puffed and fluffed from the apex of
her built-up coiffure to far far below her (I sup-
pose high-heeled) shoes. A fabric as fragile as a
dream, and embroidered like a vision, frames her
face and falls and rolls its waves to mingle with
the long, convoluted billows of the train, which is
all swept to the front, and surges over the whole
of the foreground of the picture like a whirlwind
of drapery. There is four times as much train as
bride, and from her waist down it falls in a
torrent of blossoms, foliage and ribbons. Further
“ abstractions ” are jewels, retouchings, and a
chair. A fashionable bride in all her expensive
bridal clothes and posed by the camera man is a
much finer creation than the first bride—a simple
thing that was made out of a plain rib.
Miss Ismay Preston, Lord Gormanston’s only
daughter, who is to marry the Marquis of Bute s
brother, was about 18 when her father left his
Governorship of Tasmania five years ago. She is
making what is known as a good match. Both
families are said to be painfully pious, and hers is
as poor as Bute’s is rich. The bride-elect was
chief bridesmaid to the Marchioness of Bute when
the latter was married last year; now she weds
the best man of that occasion, and as, no doubt,
they have Tasmania’s permission, the young
couple ought to be very happy. The Gormanstons
are slow as well as poor. The first Gormanston
started as an Irish peer (Baron Laundres) in the
time of Henry 11., but the family’s progress up
the ladder was very gradual. A caterpillar
could have beaten them for promotion. After
two hundred years Edward 111. made Baron
Laundres into Baron Birmingham, so he was
still only a baron. Then he was made Baron
Gormanston and it seemed that the habit of being
a baron was really incurable; the family was three
barons in 320 years, and had got no forrarder.
Finally in another hundred years it became a
Viscount an Irish Viscount, which doesn’t really
count—and then in another 400 years it was made
another baron, but this time it was a baron of the
U.K. with a seat in Parliament. But it is a
mighty slow family which spends 700 years in be-
coming four barons and a viscount. The Bute
family is niore energetic. It became a miserable
baronet 279 years ago, and since then it has become
two barons, three viscounts, five miscellaneous
Scotch lords, three earls and one marquis.
A young Maorilander, signing herself “Jessie
Murray,” writes to Otago Witness complaining
of the award in a “Ladies’Race,” in which she
ran first. She thought she was running for two
prizes—a sum of money and a bachelor, but
as it happens the bloque was an alternative prize,
and she got only the lucre. Now, she wants the
editorial Jove to say how she shall get possession
of Donald. Instead of telling hfer that he knows
two hundred women who would cheerfully part
with their husbands, or that the husband quarry
is caught by stalking, not by racing, or that a girl
named Jessie ought not to have to appeal to him
how to take a hurdle—l mean a husband—he
soothes her with gentle evasions. The fashion of
wife-taking in the stone age—that of catching her
in a loop and dragging her to the captor’s cave-
saved women a lot of worry. You remember the
clever but passe Matildadon in the story who, after
vainly throwing herself in the way of a rich young
ciive-dweller and his lassoo, finally crept up behind
him as he was going home one night with his lassoo
trailing over his shoulder, and slipped her head
into'the noose, and so walked calmly in the rear
as a captured bride-elect. Her family (with clubs
and flints), who were loitering in the neighbor-
hood of the bachelor’s cave, affected surprise at
the “unexpected engagement.” However, they
were there to see that Billodsm’s intentions were
honorable. And the bridegroom-elected had to
make the best of a bad way of carrying his en-
gagement ring.
A daily paper item :
R. O. Graham, a porter employed at the Adelaide Rail-
way Station, drew in Tattersall’s sweep Ossian, which ran
second in the Australian Cup. The prize is worth £2OOO.
Graham is a single man, and the sole support of his
mother, a widow.
Usually the method of Nature is to blow-up “the
sole support of his widowed mother ” in a mine, or
wreck him on a Bent railway, or drown him whilst
he’s trying to save a stranger’s life. The awful
frequency with which that phrase, “he was the
sole support of a widowed mother,” is appended
to the report of some violent.taking-off must have
struck every newspaper reader. For once at least
Tattersall has been kinder than Nature.
John Cleland, M.D., son of Dr. Cleland, of
S.A. Lunatic Asylum, has been appointed Bac-
teriologist at Perth Public Hospital. Cleland
studied the art and mystery of the human interior
in Sydney, and filled the position of resident
doctor at the Sydney Hospital for a year. Then
he went to Europe and studied the human interior
for another year, on the off-chance that he had
missed some of it, or that the human in Europe
had some interior that wasn’t known in Australia.
Mr. Theo. Marks, who accompanied his sister
and cousin to India, is said to have broken the
bank at Monte Carlo. The Marks party is on
its way back to Sydney, and the bank is trying
to gather itself up from the floor and piece itself
together again.
Monsieur Degen will arrive in Sydney towards
the end of this week on a holiday tour. His wife
who accompanies him, is the youngest daughter of
the late W. B. Dailey, politician, orator, man of
letters, and m his time Australia’s Noblest Son.
Mr. Frederick B. Sharp (he will be remem-
bered as the clever comic man of the late Arnold
co. playing the Professor in “What Happened
to .Jones and kindred roles, though, in reality
Jones rather Happened to other people than was
Happened t°) arrived by the Orontes last week
and skipped on the Warrimoo next day en route
for Maoriland. He gave up the stage, studied for
the Bar and intends to pluck the moa in Seddon’s
country— t.e., to practise there.
Miss Edith Collins, the Brisbane girl with the
dramatic soprano, has been taking the choir in-
visible role in “The Sign of the Cross” at the
JraJace, and taking the ear of the audience as well.
Xhis young singer and her sister have fine voices
but as yet have not had a fair hearing in Sydney*
And The Sign of the Cross” doesn’t give them
large show. It is full of tuneless Early
Christians who make a great noise so as not to
draw the attention of the Late Heathens, and
there is a bass lion or two that make a few re-
marks occasionally, but it is hardly an operatic
masterpiece.
Talking of singers: The Auckland girl Ivy
Ansley, a contralto, writes to her friends that
Melba is paying the whole of her expenses with
Marchesi and of her residence in Paris. An old
I rench maid of Melba’s engaged a room at a
pension for the girl, met her at the station, and
acted as her interpreter. While Miss Ansley was
m London, Melba gave her a lesson every day and
said the loveliest things about her voice.” Well
now, it is Madame Crossley’s turn to put a soprano
in training for pure love and affection. Melba
wouldn t care what she spent if she could put a
first-rate contralto of her own choosing on the
market.
Miss Kate Rooney is to be a star singer at the
great Eaelic concerts —afternoon and evening—at
Covent Garden, London, on the 17tli of Ireland
Miss Rooney’s success in London has been
emphatic. Another of Madame Christian’s pupils
Muss Eugenie Boland, who sails for the Big
ornoky City next month, I hear of now as going
to Wagga for the 17th this year. Last year, oh
that date, the same charming singer was at Wagga
Wagga, whose inhabitants put on much
Dogga over the fact that she was paid for singing
in their country town the highest fee disbursed
in the Australian States on that particular night.
Miss Ethel Mills, the Australian short storyist
writes to a Sydney friend that she is now
Mrs. Primrose. The happy ’groom is, presumably,
Mr. Primrose, a brother of Mrs. Anderson
Stuart He used to be a Queenslander,
and it Lord Rosebery’s two sons were to melt
into the infinite azure of the past leaving no
heirs, Ethel’s husband would succeed. But with
the usual inscrutability of Providence there are
no estates or gold in the Queensland branch of
the Primrose family.
Francis McCornas, the Australian-born water
colorist, was holding an exhibition of his pictures
at San Irancisco when the mail left. A critic in
the Argonaut says: “It becomes more and more
impertinent and futile to attempt to describe
or analyse McComas’s pictures; each in its
beauty seems like a single phrase in a symphony
. . . eyes of genius . . . brain of a poet . . .
hand of a master.” Anyone who wants more than
that in praise must be a glutton. Same paper
speaks of Nellie Stewart as an actress “utterly
devoid of the art of suggestion, but having many
tricks of technique, natural magnetism, and
wholesome attractiveness . . . Miss Stewart is a
little woman, with a ravishing figure, and a small
shrewd, pretty face, albeit its natural qualities
are submerged under a tidal ivave of artifice that
leaves one guessing as to where her eyes begin
and her mouth ends.” It is curious for us here
to see in all the American papers comments on the
Australian company’s “English speech” and
‘ English accent,” which “pleases the ear better
than the New York imitation of it.”
An Australian writes from Dinard about
the charm, variety and popularity of mixed
bathing at that fashionable watering place,
and wonders why we cannot cultivate something
of the same in Australia. “In Europe the tide
fluctuates more than with us in many places For
instance, at Mt. St. Michel, near Dinard, it runs
out many miles over the sand and comes in like
an express train. The bathing hour is therefore
regulated by the tide. That hour is the great one
of the day in Dinard forsocial reunion. You join
what is called the cercle des betigneurs i.e., get’a
number of tickets at the same time that you be-
come a member of the Casino. Anyone can join who
is not a tramp or a lunatic. Tickets cost a franc
each. lor this you have a right to a little canvas
bouse on wheels it is wheeled down near the
water s edge for you—and also to the services of a
man or old woman, who brings you two tubs after
the bath, one of cold, the other of hot fresh, water.
Also there are floating wooden diving platforms
and resting places, rafts, etc., and three or four
boats, for emergencies, with sailors in them. You
can get towels or costumes, but the women (and
most of the men) bring their own. If the
tide is favorable at a good time of the day, *people
stay in (or rather out) for hours. That is to say
men and women, in the most elaborate cos-
tumes, sit and chat on the beach under
big colored canvas umbrellas, swim out to one of
the wooden rests perhaps, come back and
greet their acquaintances again, have a cigarette,
fruit, and so on. A swarm of maids with
their mistresses’ peignoirs hang about, and men’s
valets do likewise. When the women finally come
out, the maids rush to the water’s edge and
envelope their shrinking forms in these wraps, in
which they walk to their tents. I don’t know why
the wraps are only used going from the water to the
tent, but they are. The costumes are often simple
to an embarrassing degree. Other amusements
at these places are golf, tennis (a great feature
at Dinard), and cards. At the Dinard Ladies’
Club they play very high.
The Oldhams, of that picturesque home of many
owners, “ Carthona, ” are off to Europe. Other
departers are the opulent widow Flood, and
Miss Nea White, of “Greenoaks.” Latter’s father
died recently, and left his women kin heavily
gilded. Mrs. White gave £lOO to the Jap famine
fund. Miss Jean Brenan, the head of that smart
little flower and food shop in George-street, leaves
this month for a nine months’ ramble abroad.
Her popularity is proved by the figures on the au
revoir cheque handed her by a few friends. It
was a swiftly and quietly gathered testimonial,
yet it ran to £2OO.
The marriage, yesterday, of Miss Violet Mac-
Pherson. an Anglo-Indian connection of the
Arthur Lassetters, who has been living in Tas-
mania, to a Major Fitzmaurice, who earns his
crust in South Africa, roused the Pointer people
to large excitement. The bridesmaids honored
i? 6 >rl<^e s Christian name in their dressing, and
the “ neck corsets ” of their gowns were the latest
thing in high modelling. Bride’s father, though
• —“begad, he took the wimmins’ eyes,” as Mul-
vaney did. He wore what the guests called
vicariously a “Windsor uniform’’and a “Privy
Councillor’s gala dress.” Anyhow, it, with its
Indian sun or star on the breast, was awesome.
He was something elevated in the law line in
India—so high, I believe, that you required a
ladder to get up to him. There’s a point of
romance in the match. Bridegroom and bride
have liked each other, or been engaged, or some
such, for nine years.
Mr. Owen Cox, who now leads the Commis-
sionership for the Maoriland Exhibition by the
hand and talks to it like a child, starts for
Maoriland this week under a full head of
gasolene, or whatever it is that pushes the
Moeraki along, for a week’s work on twenty-first
century matters. Also he has accepted an invita-
tion to dine in Paris with the Wards and Chap-
mans and other important postmen on the some-
thingth day of June. Invitations fot four months
ahead ought at least to wear D. V, on their face.
The Motor Boat Club whirred up to Gore Bay
on Saturday night under the stars and blown
clouds and broken lights. Then it hung Chinese
lanterns all around its collective launch until
the scene reminded everyone who hadn’t been to
Venice of a night on the Grand Canal in the City
of the Doges. The launches grouped themselves
around a little ferry steamer, and their occupants
listened to a programme of band, song and recita-
tion.
The Conference of Methodists sitting in Sydney
last week “affirmed ” that it had no desire to
pose before the camera for its picture. That
shows more self-denial than the average cleric gets
credit for. One photographer tells how he is
frequently invited to take “weddings” in a cer-
tain church, the celebrant always stipulating that
he shall be taken in a “commanding position,
with his eyes raised.” On hot days the camera-
fiend has fumed and perspired forquite a while
under his covering, waiting for the celebrant to get
into a sufficiently commanding position, and turn
his eyes up to heaven.
What a mania some people have for taking off
their hats on every possible occasion ! A man has
lately written to a daily paper saying he was glad
to see that some men had the decency to take off
their belltoppers in front of the Holy Hunt pic-
ture, and he suggested that all women who gaze
at the canvas in big hats should have them
forcibly removed. Well, if I am deeply moved
when I go to see the picture, I will “take off
my boots and look on reverentially in my bare
feet, and, at a push, I would even go home and
take off my corset, and come back to study the
work of art respectfully with that article in my
hand. But anybody who proposes to take off my
hat in front of any picture will have to climb over
my dead body to do it.
Holman Hunt’s “ Light of the World” will be
on exhibition at Sydney some time this week.
Mr. Mack .lost is in charge of it for its owner,
Mr. Chas. Booth. The picture is a life size
replica done by the artist of the original, but
smaller, one painted by him some fifty-four years
ago.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
WORSE THAN THE RABBITS.
A Japanese naval training’ squadron, with about 300
cadets on board, will visit Australia in May.
“ Hulloa , Danysz! How are you good for Japs !”
The patriotism of the British Empiah
League doesn’t run to the price of many beeahs.
Among the articles recently advertised by the
Customs for sale as unclaimed goods—really goods
on which the consignee wouldn’t pay the trifling
duty—was a parcel of the League publications,
sent from England to the League in Australia.
There wasn’t any limelight and public pose to be
got out of paying eighteen-pence duty for the
Jingo Terruth ; so the Terruth was allowed to lie
in a bond store and feed the rats.
By recent legislation in Victoria, every
stream and lake has been vested in the State.
N.S.W. should take the same step, and then care-
fully guard the rivers against impurity. There is
scarcely a river in the Ma State from which it is
safe to drink, yet the rivers provide the only water
supply of many towns. The McDonald, the
Hunter, and practically all the inland riyers,
are freely defiled by the settlers along their banks.
Hence the prevalence of typhoid inland.
Some N.S.W. persons have started to call
loudly for subscriptions of Is. and upwards in
order to found “ the Australian Immigration
League,” having the following objects
The education of the Australian people as to the
need of increased population of the agricultural class.
The dissemination of information both in Australia
and in Europe with regard to agriculture and land
settlement.
The advocacy of a vigorous policy of closer settlement
and of placing city people on the soil.
Which verbiage is mostly nonsense, for the reason
that nearly all the land which should be available
to attract immigrants is locked against them, and, if
opened at all, will only be opened at prices that
mean rack-rent and grinding toil. If the League,
instead of cadging shillings, were to devote its
energies to winning votes for the Federal Labor
party’s graduated land-tax policy, it might have a
chance of achieving its purpose of placing people
on the soil.
Victorian authorities can be recklessly
generous when they like. An Argus advt.
(3/3/’O6) called for an overseer of printing at Pent-
ridge gaol, to undertake these duties:—
To instruct prisoners in the general work of a printer,
including composing and stereotyping, and also to impart
a general knowledge to prisoners in all branches of book-
binding; to prepare periodical statements of require-
ments, and to perform all the necessary clerical work of a
printer’s shop; to maintain discipline amongst the
prisoners, and to perform warder’s duties when it Is con-
sidered necessary.
He is to receive £lBO a year, and must not be more
than 45 years of age. But it would take the
average man about 50 years to attain perfection
in all those trades. Consider —at least three
branches of printing (each a distinct trade), aiid
as many of bookbinding, besides clerical work
and book-keeping, not to speak of an occasional
willing go with convict 99 when he drops a galley
of type and refuses to distribute the “ pi.” Varied
as have been Bent’s experiences, it is doubtful if
even he could fulfil any such mixed assortment of
duties, though the munificent salary of £3 9s. per
week might tempt him to make a stagger at it if
he were disengaged.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 13, 1906.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Much-discussed marriage of Captain Fitzpatrick
and Miss Connie Armytage falls due in April.
The groom-elect has been in town for the past
fortnight amassing trousseau ties, and other
items of gay apparel. There’s to be a gorgeous
ceremony. bu\any fond couple that hopes to sur-
pass the grandeur of the Stuart-Oliver display had
better abandon the foolish notion. It’s idle trying
to do anything better than a comic-opera marriage
show. The next thing would be a harlequin and
columbine wedding, the parties bounding and
twirling to the altar steps. And the churches are
not likely to encourage that as a novelty. In fact,
the vergers are already protesting. Confetti and
unboiled rice are now forbidden fruit in the
tabernacle. Even rose leaves are vetoed by some
church custodians, and old shoes mean a heavy
fine.
Autumn-deckers had no chance to spread their
new sails at the Australian Cup. The sun was
emphatic, and a cloudless sky gave the new season’s
goods no hope. So everyone paraded in trans-
parent yokes and large strips of bare arm. A
double set of vice-regals stalked the terrace tiles.
Both dames evidenced a pretence of court
mourning, and promenaded in subdued raiment,
followed by a procession of aides looking very
like model funeral mutes. Melancholy grey
gloves helped the cortege idea. The State Ex.
lengthened her long figure by a tailed garb
of chaste white voile topped by a severe
specimen of interesting mauve millinery. The
Northcote Dame trailed in a lilac black and white
foulard. More lilac crowned the head-piece.
This Ex. does $t least appear to be on excellent
terms with her clothes. She went about in a
business-like, health-seeking manner, and hoisted a
plain black brolly with the practical idea of em-
ploying its By the way, the wholly
frivolous Miss refuses to carry any sort of ’brella.
It is the emblem of surburban sobriety in her eyes,
and stands for all that is cautious, careful, and
commonplace. Like specs, the giddy girl holds
“ the gamp” in horror. Thehe-rake views carpet
slippers in the same light.
Colonel and Mrs. Godwin were at the Cup
meeting, and swelled the interest of the Bowes-
Kelly’s Terrace swarm. All the Cream had coy
memories of Mrs. Willie Mitchell and her
Flemington chiffon-treats. But in Mrs. Godwin
they eyed a much-subdued and chastened dresser.
Her range of greys was far from buoyant, and her
figure (once the envy of Toorak) undistinguished.
Her Colonel-spouse wore a much gayer tone of
grey, and a glad, rollicking cravat. The one
other notable dame in the Mount Morgan
contingent was Mrs. Edwin Millar, who summered
it in cerulean hue, with fleecy laces floating over
the sky tone. A black-feathered hat was set
at a persuasive angle on the coppery head of the
handsome dame. Mrs. J. Alston Wallace ex-
ploited the most effective of white muslins, and
from her sensational hat there waved a sea-weed
sort of feather in green and coral pink tones. The
Misses Guthrie, in mole and putty-colored frocks,
put in a good word for the Geelong clan. Mrs.
Ross-Soden, back from Colombo, made an appear-
ance with a swarthy young Tyson relative.
A bright bachelor medico who was summoned
hastily to the toilette department of the Fleming-
ton course, on the Australian Cup day, to attend
a suffering girleen, was dumbfounded at the sight
he beheld. Feminine eyes are accustomed to it.
The man of the stethoscope relates how the shock
affected him : “ With my mind bent only on the
case, I followed my messenger straight into the
big dressing-room. My stars ! Thirty or forty
women were ranged before the long line of mirrors
‘ making up ’-—I think that’s what they call it. A
dozen or two Others looked on. A few pumped at
the scent-sprays. It wasn’t only flour and white
stuff they applied. They were engaged brushing
into the lips and cheeks a beautiful bright red
blush. I noticed a few applied a mysterious
mauve sort of cushion to the cheeks. I say
applied. The majority smacked on the stuff. The
mauve decorators went at it delicately. It was a
great lesson in how lovely woman adopts and ap-
plies her permanent bloom. I had to be torn
forcibly from the spot to attend my case—and
just in time. Some of the charmers looked like
attacking me with hatpins and covering me with
ignominy and powder.”
The flutterer was deterred by a stormy sky from
wearing her best bib and ticker at the final
Flemington horse rally. She went forth mostly
arrayed in the summer survival rig, or in a
’tween-season frock of concessional hue and tex-
ture. A trio of smart riggers who generally
contribute a chiffon treat dressed up to a tempest
and hurricane barometer. Mrs. Gordon Lyon,
Miss Alison Fairbairn and Miss Ethel Guthr.„
were the pessimists in deadly black. A white
feather or two saved them from an en-
tirely funereal aspect. Melba’s young sister —
Miss Dora Mitchell —was' a rare promenader
in suitable rig. ‘She wore mole cloth with relief
of white tucker, chemisette, and long cuffs. The
millinery was on excellent terms with the garb.
In most other cases, the top and lower mainsails
quarrelled outrageously. An ermine toque, for
instance, snarled and showed its teeth at a tropi-
cal rig of flowery muslin. In another instance, a
velvet head-piece with sable tips sulked in
proximity to a light fabric with skin
insertions to its pneumonia yoke. The youngest
hope of Byron Moore was a refreshing Autumn
sight in a warm cream rig with emerald edges, and
a cream toque stabbed with a gay emerald wing.
Generally speaking, all Saturday’s millinery
savored of an ostrich farm. Hundreds of dead
birds were laid to rest on the heads of the she-
multitude.
Miss Stuart-Wortley was let off the Court
mourning infliction. She has been sunning herself
abroad in various shades of blue, and looking
capable of much frivolity if she only had the
chance. It must be a trying thing to walk in the
dull, stately shadow of a pair like the Talbottles.
And etiquette doesn’t allow of the nieces of an
Ex. holding hands in public with an aide, even
should there be one willing on the spot. It seems
a shame that a young Miss, addicted to cheerful-
ness, should have to keep her smile on the chain
and walk with her pretty mouth in a muzzle.
The physical culture girl has a better chance of
trapping one of the reluctant sex than any she
who merely warbles and paws ivory. A culturist
on exhibition at an Austral Salon shivoo, last year,
caught the eye of a moneyed young medico. He
went down like a ninepin before the demonstrat-
ing Juno, and they were married. Now, dozens
of local girls are at breathing exercises and muscle
development, and strain before the mirror to work
dimples into the shoulder-blades and to acquire
undulations. And, meanwhile, thecareworn furrow
of concentration betwixt the brows grows deep
enough to accommodate a few tram tickets and a
hankie.
Town clerk Clayton puts on a different deport-
xflgnt and a fresh expression with each succeeding
mayor. With the M‘Eacharn the small Achates
bowed his crested head. The great Pooh-Bah
Mac walked in front, whether dressed in the kilt
or any other garb of authority, and his attitude
declared, “When I ope my mouth let no dog
bark.” Achates behaved accordingly, and
didn’t bark. With the Strong and Gillott
worships he rose higher on the pavement
stones of his clerkly self, and led the way
with measured step and slow. It was con-
ceded that he knew more about the ways of
mayoralty than either of these mayoral strutters.
With druggist Pleasance a deferential tone marked
Achates’ behavior. Here was a worship of
ideas, opinions and a man-about-town record—the
first of the chained brotherhood to know some-
thing about Art and to genuinely love the aesthetic.
The present worship has come with an entirely
different deportment. It is consequential and
impressive. Achates leads on and wags his tail in
an eloquent manner. He is the mayor, whilst wor-
ship Weedon walks through the part.
Curtain hangings are odd enough in any
millinery hue, but in flame color they resemble
bush fires, and look suspiciously like a confla-
gration streaming up the back of the fashionable
wearer, who probably isn’t insured. The cerulean
blue and milk-white hangings from the summer
hats had a vaporish, cloudy, mist-on-the-moun-
tain effect that formed part of the Sunny Girl
picture, but heavy marms and crow-footed
spinsters flaunting velvet and funereal palls to
their hat-brims strike a ludicrous note. It’s as
bad as the specimens with splinter arms saun-
tering abroad in baby puff-sleeves.
They must be badly off for pets in John Bull’s
country. Some of the aristocracy are even taking
marmosets to their crazy hearts. That represents
the limit of the pet folly. There’s nothing nastier
than the monkey craze. The Linlithgow Lord
isn’t accused of monkeys or guinea-pigs, but the
two Hope ladyships run to otter pets. Another
titled crank twines a small boa-constrictor round
her neglected neck. One almost has sympathy
for the giddy duchesses who have promiscuous
human sleeves surrounding their necks. After
all, a tame, clean johnnie is more reasonable as a
plaything than a hideous beast of filthy habits.
There’s a small excitement as to the sort of
chappie Captain Crichton is to prove. He’s the
incoming aide-brother to the Crichton who fol-
lowed in the wake of the Mighty Atom and his
ducal consort out here. The likelihood of aides
as marriage- mates occurs to Toorak now that one
of them has voted for wedlock with a golden
charmer of the locality. For a long time the vice-
regal caddie has been regarded as a mere orna-
mental appendage to the suite. A.s a likely
husband he comes as a harbigner of happy fate.
The new aide is due any hour. In the meantime,
Captain Buxton gets to heel whenever the Ex.
whistles for a follower. When his successor comes
Buxton departs for Japan.
Miss Eugenie Duggan, got up somewhat in her
“ Camille ” rig, spread her chiffons over the D.C.
at ‘ ‘ Leah EUeschna ” the other night. She was
elaborately decorated. Her wonderful profusion
of bronzy locks was mostly concentrated in a
giant bun on the nape of her neck. Over one ear
and most of the vicinity a rose of colossal circum-
ference was stuck or glued or nailed. Lovely
cream laces foamed and fussed riotously about her
prosperous person. Hers was the one startling
get-up in a large, dull, Friday audience.
Miss Alison Fairbairn is the sort to run the
matrimonial course in an amiable but firm man-
ner. Already she takes her fiance a-motoring,
and flings him a few condensed remarks as she
steers the car and him along the Toorak roads.
Colonel Ferguson and his grey spouse are
guesting it at the Victorian Government House.
The lady is sister to Victor Hood —one of the vice-
regal staff.
The Akgus Mackinnons are back in a plump
drove. At Flemington they held a levee minus
ushers and pasteboards. They motored each day
from the course.
The Norton Grimwades are in the last batch to
sail for London in time for the May gaieties.
-They leave next week, and Toorak will feel
bereaved till they return.
The Cliveden Dowager is a wonder. There are
crowds who refuse to say as much, but in justice
it has to be conceded. The very day she
left for the Cold Country she was round seeing the
ear, eye and heart doctors in a juvenile rush.
I hen all the senses are in prime order. A
Collins-street repairer tells me there’s scarcely a
dame in all A ilia boasting the capable
physique and sp> l nerve-system of this black-
haired grandmotj.
The dived > l ger had a swarm of fare-
wellers strug _ m. her industrious palm at
Port Melboui. o-. . sday. Race-goers hurried
their blessing.- ■ ,>r< > 10 entrain for Flemington ;
but a large floe f .-mu-religious, solely political,
and. purely ch table feminines remained in a
farewell crush : l a state of profuse perspiration
till the hauling up of the gangway.
An engagement announced is that of Miss Ida
Jell, daughter of an Albury-side squatter, to Dr.
Harry Strong, eldest son of the Melbourne ex-
Worship. The pair have been forward promen-
aders at all the horse rallies.
A Colossus on the • Strand, who deals in large
winning specs., is likely to bid for some more
matrimony this year. The siren also has worn the
weeds for a spell. There must be a most subtle
bond of sympathy between these lone ones who
shed the weeds for each other. They know.
Actor Kingston, who used to make hot and
fervent love to Miss Nance O’Neil over the backs
of stage chairs and other decorative barriers, is
again on his way out for Williamson productions.
Girls used to wonder why the curly-pated mum-
mer always breathed his boiling vows of love and
devotion to the large lady from the other side of
the cabinet or the couch, Will he talk as far
away from Miss Brune ?
Miss Muriel Cumming is starting to spin
through a gay Mayfair season with her Ruperts-
wood sister. A recent letter from a Melbourne
girl relates that the chick was wise in bringing
along only a trunk or two of necessary clothes
to the Cold Country. She put on a hustle, and
left her measure with the Regent-street builders
as soon as she landed, for the most fetching garbs
cut to date. And she revolved immediately like
one of the sprucest Londoners. You leave your
measure, it seems, one hour, and the frock comes
home with its final hook and eye attached the
next. That’s the best of a crowded city and ex-
cessive competition.
The milliner gets another blow. Classes for
demonstrating how to hoist a top-sail and to lay
out a dead bird are crowding out this capital, and
the rich Miss of the suburbs is attending to learn
how the thing is done. It’s not difficult to learn,
and the milliner who charges six guineas for a bit
of plaited straw with a Wyandotte hen’s wing
put upside down on it is superseded by the
amateur hat-rigger. The Miss finds that her
materials cost less than a pound, and when
manipulated with a cheap dexterity, which she
learned for another pound, they result in a master-
piece that looks fit to show anywhere.
Two sister theatre graces, who evolved originally
from a prosperous jug-entrance establishment in
Sydney, are billed for the matrimonial stakes
after a gay season in this city. One is pledged to
an American in the gem line ; the other Siren to
a Hebrew son of the turf. Considering that the
old-time Jew was mostly an infantry soldier it is
wonderful how his descendants have taken to the
horse.
Those much-discussed Primroses have set a new
parlor craze going. The girls squat on the floor in a
row, and give their lower limbs a diagonal hoist.
Then the men ha ve to stand afar off from a screen that
covers all but the silk-hosed props, and guess who
their owners are. As no previous knowledge of
the limbs is claimed the guessing has to be a
matter of keen inductiveness or a divine intuition.
It’s a giddy parlor game, but the screen draws
the line somewhere between the honi soit and the
shoe, and that saves the situation.
The circle at the Opera House has some smart
young things to the fore these nights, not so much
to see the upside-down Primroses-as to study the
gorgeous creations of Miss Alice Raymond—the
lady who blows music into a variety of large shiny
instruments. All her garbs are fresh from Paris,
and look it. This trumpetress is a dazzler.
A pet mummer of the hour has been getting
into trouble through his careless selection of
friends and indiscriminate way of moving round.
He isn’t sufficient of a social student to notice
where one set begins and the other
ends hence the trouble. A damsel who
makes herself violently ill over these little
matters endeavored to show the beauty-
man the error of his social ways. He
promised to try and work the conundrum out, but
his head has ached so badly that he thinks it
better to clear out of the place altogether than
stay and hurt the feelings of sensitive people. The
position summed up amounts to this —one set of
tortoise-shells won’t play in the star’s back-yard
if he consorts with another set of tabbies. So he
leaves the country in consequence.
“Jeame Gunn,” authoress of “A Little Black
Princess,” which continues to sell well, is in
private life Mrs. AEneas Gunn, a gentle, winsome,
little widow. The success of the book in question
—a record of the writer’s life on a lonely station
in the Gulf country —is, in some small degree, a
compensation for the sadness of the close of Mrs.
Gunn’s bush career. The remote homestead,
where she spent her brief married life, was so
lonely that no other white woman could be in-
duced to share the bride’s exile. Her husband
took ill, and was nursed devotedly by his wife and
the three men on the place. The presence of a
doctor was out of the question, but one was
written to and sent medicine to relieve the sick
man’s pain. The remedies arrived too late for
the husband, but proved the saving of the wife,
Who was struck down with the same complaint as
soon as she had seen her patient through his
sufferings. Mrs. Gunn was, in her turn, nursed
with the most devoted care by two of the men,
while the third rode hundreds of miles, hoping to
bring back with him the only other woman in the
district, a line-repairer’s wife. This sought-after
lady declined to set out on the formidable journey,
saying, reasonably enough, “ What if Mrs. Gunn
dies before I get there? The sickness killed
her husband, and may do the same for her. Sup-
posing I get out there to find her gone, and catch
the same trouble myself. I’ll be in a worse fix
than she, for she knows the men that are nursing
her. They’re complete strangers tome.” So Mrs.
Gunn recovered without feminine assistance, and
when she was strong enough to be driven down to
the coast, was escorted by her three faithful
knights of the backblocks to the protection of her
relatives, who had come from Melbourne to meet
her. AEneas Gunn himself had literary ambitions,
and would have been overjoyed at the success of
his wife’s book had he lived to see it. He was a
cousin of Mr. Fred Bradshaw, that staunch and
kindly pioneer who was killed by the Northern
blacks last December.
Two pairs advertised their new affianced state
at the four Flemington rallies. On such an
occasion, for the first day the sentimental link
arouses excited comment and discussion. After
that, unless the fair young'thing flourishes fresh
chiffons, interest wanes. Finally the pair pro-
voke the tired feeling. One rural Miss knew this,
and served the freshest of rigs on the spying
sisterhood.
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.
THAT MEETING.
An interview took place yesterday between the State
Premier and Mr. G. H. Reid. Mr. Carruthers explained
that a number of matters of interest were discussed, but
not of public importance.
“ That’s a fine girl they've got at Rickards’ now."
Archdeacon Gunther lately announced *to
the N.S.W. Missionary Association that the send-
ing home of kanakas at the expiration of their
terms, according to the strict letter of the agree-
ment made with them, is “distinctly opposed to
the principles of Christianity.” The Bulletin
begins to fear that Archdeacon Gunther has never
met with the principles of Christianity.

POLITICAL
POINTS
‘ ‘ About the only solid complaint in
Maoriland against the popular Mr. Seddon is
his undue desire to have an early-door ticket
for the London pawn office. — Sydney Telegraph.
From a sermon by Bishop Duhig (R.C.),
Rockhampton
He longed to see in every school in Australia a spirit of
Australian patriotism. Children must be taught that
they had a country of their own ; a country to he proud
of ; a country they were to live and work for ; that they
were to go out and develop its resources, and make Aus-
tralia great in the world. They must not decry Aus-
tralia ; they must make the children proud of it, and
teach them to remember that love of country js next to
love of God. '
In one breath Bundaberg (Q.) sugar
planters say that, the industry is doomed to
destruction because of the white labor conditions;
and in the next they estimate the crop during the
coming cutting season will be three times the
tonnage of last year, and 1905 was a specially
good year. 1
The hand of philanthropic Britain grows
heavy when the black subject begins to have too
many opinions of his own. Colonel Leuchars
shelled a native kraal, and being asked why, told
the niggers that “ the guns were the voice of the
Supreme Chief.” And an “educated Kaffir”
who had urged his fellows not to pay a poll-tax—
an ebony Hampden—got six months and a flogging.
George Reid has found a policy at last.
He says he stands for honesty in Australian
politics.
Though honesty’s a policy
That’s vaunted much, we think it’s not
Worth making George a leader on,
If it’s the only one he’s got.
Minister Swinburne (Vic.) says that the
Japanese are a very sentimental people, and “any
help from us to relie ye the famine would w’in high
appreciation.” Probably. Supposing Cole, and
Bruce Smith, and other advocates of colored labor
went forth and solemnly disembowelled them-
selves in Japanese styb as a delicate compliment
to Japan. That should win high appreciation.
The departmental survey of Strathkellar
Estate proves once more that many Vic. squatters
hold a great deal more acres than they ever paid for.
Strathkellar panned out nearly 200 acres better
than the original survey, and most Western Vic.
stations would probably have even more “extras”
than this. The bribing of old-time surveyors is
alleged to be responsible. It is pleasant to reflect
that the squattocracy has always supplied the
Uppah House with gentlemen of spotless
integrity.
There seems to be hardly a whisper of
protest from Europe in regard to the latest
massacre of missionaries in China. That bloated
empire begins to look like a dangerous unknown
quantity. Times have changed since an Aus-
tralian magistrate, dealing with some young
larrikins found guilty of cruelly assaulting a
Chinaman, dismissed them with a caution on the
ground that “it was Christmas” —as if the right
to bash a Chow were an appropriate Christmas
box to young Australia. ’
It is now explained that the drought and
consequent famine in Japan are chiefly confined to
three provinces with a population of a little over
2,800,000. This sets one thinking. Japan has
a total population of 44,000,000, and one would
think that the 41,000,000 who are not struck by
famine could carry the famine-stricken 3,000,000 or
less easily enough. Even if they can’t, living is
so cheap in Japan that a £10,000,000 loan would
more than see the trouble through. In any case
the Jap budget for 1905-6, as set forth in
Whitaker’s Almanac, foreshadows a revenue of
£31,000,000, and an expenditure of only £21.600,000,
and a country that dreams of a £9,500,000 surplus
should surely not require anonymous donations of
flour from Australia. Japan is even now build-
ing two first-class battleships, and greatly en-
larging its army, and paying off its debt, and
otherwise performing the star part on the world’s
stage, and at the same time accepting foreign
charity for its mere handful of drought-stricken
people. The position seems incongruous.
One Gippsland (Vic.) public body has
expressed “gratitude for the visit of Mr. Bent,
which w r as followed by beneficial rains.”
“ Quandong ” : Let us give the “ sweater”
his due. The postmaster at Coraki (N.S.W.), re-
cently sentenced for embezzling over £7OO, was
not in receipt of less than £3 per week, as stated
(B. 11/3/’O6). During the period over which his
defalcations extended (i.c , while he has been a
Federal officer), his salary was £2lO per annum,
less £2l for rent of quarters.
Extract from report of the Tariff Com-
mission :
Senator M'Gregor : Has your residence there (in Japan
and China) led you to believe that any of the Australian
laws have caused any prejudice there against us?
Witness (Frederic Jones, Queensland State Commis-
sioner) : Not at all. It has only been caused by people
there, horrible people, calling themselves Australians, who
decry the country.
And Jones might have gone a step further and
called them loathsome people without putting such
a strain on the two ends of the truth as to cause it
to burst with a rending sound in the middle.

THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.
Minister for Education Sachse (Vic.) proposes establishing a system of perambulating State schools, whereby
children living in remote districts may enjoy the benefits of free, secular, compulsory education. The idea is to fit out
vans and send them into the backblocks in charge of capable teachers.
N.S.W. Supreme Court gives a sort of
guarded sanction to the contention that if a bur-
glar breaks into a hotel after 11 p.m., or on Sun-
day, the publican is liable to be fined because the
man is not there for a lawful purpose, and is on
the premises after legal drinking hours !
Fitzroy (Melb.) Laborites solemnly resolved,
the other night, that “ the action of thee Govern-
ment in exporting the best and superior commodi-
ties of life, leaving the inferior qualities for local
consumption, is an injustice to the Common-
wealth.” But those Labor men seem to have got
but a feeble grasp of the stick. The. trouble is
that this country has borrowed so much that it
has now to send away annually large quantities of
produce to pay the interest on its debts ; and, as
the best stuff costs no more to send than the
worst, and as the creditor will take the best only
(he can get equally good elsewhere), this country
just has, to send it, injustice or no injustice.
The Defence Department does some breath-
less things at times. It has decided to protect
and fortify the Derwent River—about the finest
port in the Commonwealth—with one 6in. gun-!
This is tremendous and exciting. A single
American battleship nowadays carries four 13in.
have long been put aside as vessels that may-or
may not-do a little harbor defence work, have
Binf guns. A lone and solitary 6in. gun would
have a cold time in a scrap these days.
Queensland badly wants a redistribution
of Assembly constituencies. It is 20 years since
thqre was any change. Among the wild varia-
tions at the election in 1904 were such cases as
Burke (453 electors), Bulloo (556 electors-j.
Leahy returned unopposed), Warrego (895),
Bulimba (2454), Eitzroy (2282), Woothakata
(2289), and so on—all one member constituencies,
With women added to the roll at next election
things will be worse, for there are many more
women to each hundred men on the coast than in
the west.
The Australian Immigration Restriction
Act goes on its devastating way. Last year it
shut out one British subject on the ground that he
was likely to become a charge on public charity.
The education test was applied to 108 persons,
while 47,940 were admitted without any question.
On the whole it is a very easy-going Act, much
more like a mild friendly old cat dozing by the fire
than the devastating monster that the anti-
Socialist crowd loves to depict it.
As a sorry commentary on the poverty in
the British Isles, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Asquith reckons that there are 2,018,716 persons
who would be eligible for Old age pensions on the
ground of beingpennilessand agedover 65. NiS. W.
has. 22,000 old age pensioners. If it got down to
Britain’s level of beggary it would have 71,000.
Yet Britain has more wealth per inhabitant than
N.S.W.; the curse lies in the concentration of
that wealth in a few hands.
It is difficult to sort out the merits of
the fishwives’ row of N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners. But this much stands, to the credit qf
Oliver, that he seems to-have always beeri-on- the
side of the State and the public interest when big
contracts to private firms were being discussed.
S. M. has lately been using
severe language about the proposal to increase the
very low telephone rates, and some people have
been writing to it m reply, pointing out that even
with the increase the Australian rates will be
lower than those of most countries, then the
m. Herald replied (9/3/’O6)
Comparisons between telephone charges in Australia
and in New York, Chicago, Buda Pest, and other places,
are quite out of court, seeing that the systems of the last
three named centres are privately owned. Here the sys-
*em is a Government monopoly ■
After all the Herald s whooping about the ach
vantages of private enterprise, all it can suggest.
when it bumps against a concrete instance, is that
a private monopoly would naturally charge more
than a State monopoly, and it is quite unfair to
expect anything else.
Just ’ now George
Reid is baiting a multi-
plicity of hooks with
which to catch the votes
of the unwary, and, when
they are baited, the Syd-
ney Telegraph casts
them for him. Among
the more recent fish to be
angled for, is the aged
voter who, under any law
similar to that of N.S.W.,
would be entitled to an
old age pension. Accord-
ing to the Telegraph,
George feels very much
on this subject, and his
heart is broken and his
soul crushed by the suf-
ferings of the aged poor
so callously neglected.
George then goes on to
explain that there are
difficulties in the way,
however, as, owing to
the operation of the
Braddon clause, “to
raise the sum necessary
to pay £1,500,000 for old
age pensions, £0,000,000
additional would have to
be collected at the Cus-
toms. We cannot do any-
thing till the States
agree, unless the money
is found by direct tax-
ation.” And George
leaves it at that; so
things are not very much
further ahead so far as
George is concerned.
In Maoriland the
law lays it down that
no Parliamentary candi-
date can legally spend
more than £2OO on his
election, and a return of
his expenses must be sent
in when the dogfight .is
over. But Maoriland
begins to fancy things
about the returns sent in.
Advertising and rent of
halls can be checked, but
the rest of the items are
darkly suspected of being
flapdoodle—or : at least
some kind of doodle.
Some Conservative can-
didates who were licked
during the last skirmish
are alleged to have spent
something like £lOOO
apiece, though their re-
turns don’t show it. At
various times the bill of
expenses is a bigger joke
even than the average.
George Fisher once won
his seat with' an alleged
outlay of 7s. 6d. (6d. for
cigarettes), and once in
the cheerful long ago a
candidate’s election ex-
penses were nil, and he
was 3s. 6d. to the good.
London tradespeople
have not yet got a full
understanding of what
the Labor member in-
vasion of the Commons
means. Th e average
British M.P. is a rich
person, and his custom
is eagerly sought after.
The Labor members have
been pestered with appli-
cations for custom, hint-
ing at unlimited credit.
One was offered a flat,
cheap at £165 a year.
Another was asked to
stock-up his cellars, and,
if necessary, the firm
would extend the bottle
accommodation. Others
were offered carriages,
books, houses, and so on
—all on credit.

The P™posal to call together N.S.W. Par-
bament before the date to which it was prorogued
in order that it may stop the leaks which legal
decisions have made in the Arbitration Act is not
the unexampled thing some profess it to be.
N.S.W. Parliament was called together in an
equally hurried fashion over 20 years ago to sane-
tion the enterprise which brought back a donkey
and a goat from the Soudan.
THE DIGNITY OF LABOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Labor, dispirited with constant toil,
Worn, scarred, and wasted in the endless war
’Twixt want and work, reeking with grime and soil,
The fruit his hands have nurtured, to the door
Of Croesus brings ; and humbly there requests
Some small addition to his paltry share.
Whereon the rich man at his folly jests :
“ My share is large ; yet the division’s fair,
For your share beareth what my share does not—
The Dignity of Labor you have got ! ”
. Croesus sits smiling at his subtle jest
Amongst the piled-up fruits of others’ toil,
The while he thinks : “ The winner is the best;
He with the strongest arm deserves the spoil.”
Yet Labor, too, grown wiser with the years,
Lets his rebellious thoughts the same way fall :
“ I have the power ; my dignity appears
To need the keeping of its pedestal.
I will not cast my pearls unto the swine—
The dignity and fruit shall both be mine ! ”
n.s.w.

It was the old Australian blood that scored at
Y.R.C. Autumn Meeting, as against the descendants of
comparatively new-chum sires and dams. Tartan is by
Lochiel, a Newmarket and Australian Cup winner in the
’Bo’s, out of Colors, the dam of bygone local heroes. Pen-
dant, by Far Niente, is a daughter of Necklet, who won
the Mariby long Plate in ’BB. Step Out, winner of the
Bourke H Jicap, represents the old South Australian
identities, Thunderbolt and Footstep, the latter a runner-
up for Adelaide Birthday Handicap in ’B3. And Lady
Wallace is by’ Carbine’s best son, from Lady Mostyn, bred
in S. Australia. If there were no exporting of Australian
blood stock (the exportations are always of the best) there
would be no need for further recruiting it from England.
And, by the way, why is it never recruited from France,
where racehorses, as a rule, are bigger-boned and more
Australian-like than their British relatives.
* * * *
The result of the Australian Cup confirms many
people in the opinion that Blue Spec and Scot Free were
lucky gees to finish in front of Tartan for last Melbourne
Cup.
* * * *
Flemington of late—as regards its big Spring
and Autumn race meetings—is a Tom Tiddler’s ground for
horse-owners from outside Victoria. The winner of the
last Melbourne Cup came from Westralia to do the trick ;
the two previous winners were New South Waters. Four
times in the past five years the Australian Cup and New-
market Handicap have gone to N.S.W., and this season
the Derby, Leger, and Champion Stakes have fallen to
what horse reporters call the “Sydney division.” The
Victorian cake seems to be mostly made for the “ Sydney
division.” What part is left for local consump-
tion contains very few plums and none of
them big. Even the jumping races the two
Grand Nationals at Flemington and at Caulfield—
were divided last winter by a couple of double event
winners from Adelaide and Sydney. For the present the
collective name of Victoria’s principal turfmen is merely
Mud, and the local punters who seek “ information ”
from local stables are looking for sorrow all the time.
All the local stables put together couldn’t raise any
winners worth mentioning at the V.R.C. Autumn meet. ;
moreover it happened that on some of the rare occasions
when one of them scored the “books” had little or
nothing to pay out. Step Out, Nanoya and Position, of
the horses trained on the spot, were notable turn-ups.
* * * *
Last Saturday’s racing at Flemington provided
some interesting object lessons in jockey tactics. Six
started for the Place Handicap (1£ miles), and five of the
riders were presumably under orders to avoid making the
pace. It remained for W. H. Smith, on Marmont, to take
the hurdle-and-flat ancient to the fore and plod him along
at his best pace around the somewhat muddy course.
Before the other fellows had begun to grasp the’situation
Marmont was a dozen lengths in the lead, and then they
remembered perhaps that a horse of exceptional stamina,
with only 7.2 to carry, was not likely to come back to the
field. The heavy going was in his favor, and they
had given him a long start. So they hurried
up, but they didn’t catch him. Marmont got home
by a neck from Zepho, with Bright Beauty a length
behind. The victory of the rank outsider was loudly ap-
plauded, not so much because he was an old-time hero as
because he had shaken things up from the outset. Blessed
are the pacemakers, for they give themselves no chance
to get beaten by bad luck.
The Champion Stakes would doubtless have re-
sulted in another startling triumph for the outsider Pro-
ceeder —a 25 to 1 chance in a field of four —if the aged
gelding had got the best of the start. Scot Free was
first off the mark, but Ohevally soon pushed Proceeder
ahead of the 4-year-old, and settled down to make the
pace what time Tartan was being foolishly kept in the
rearmost place, where the flying dirt gave the gallant
horse a bad time. Proceeder was ridden a “waiting”
race in front, whilst Tartan waited behind, the pace being
excellent considering the stickiness of the turf. . The re-
sult was nearly a boil-over of the big pot. Tartan made
his effort in the straight, and having passed Blue Spec
and Scot Free, he came up to the pacemaker, whereupon
Ohevally called on the pacemaker for his last little bit of
reserve force, and it almost sufficed to carry him home.
Tartan won by a bare head, but the audience rightly gave
the bigger round of applause to the beaten battler— or,
rather, his jockey.
“ 0.K.” : As a rule there is the same want of
genuineness in w.f.a. horse-racing (over long courses) as
in “ champion ” bike-racing. That is to say the jockeys
don’t bustle their horses in the way they would bustle
them if they were running a big handicap race. A w.f.a.
long distant event is won by the best animal —best on
the day—in most cases, but it seldom or never happens
that all the starters have been doing their best. Take,
for example, the Loch Plate run at Flemington last
Thursday, over the Melbourne Oup course. Tartan, Scot
Free and Blue Spec, the first three in the Melbourne Oup,
were now going- through a form of fighting their battle
over again, Spec and Scot having an extra 181 b.
and 141 b., whilst Tartan’s weight was only 41b. more
than before. The horses are all still at an im-
proving age, therefore the difference in weight would
tell very little against them in a genuine effort to
run up to their Melbourne Cup form, and if they did
have a heavier burden they were, on the otner hand,
favored by the circumstance of a smaller field. There
was nothing to interfere with any jockey’s attempt to
cover the distance as quickly as his nag’s legs could carry
him. Well, what sort of a race was it for the Loch
Plate ? Scot Free, in the language of horse reporters’
fiction, attempted to “ run away ” from the field, but it
was so poor a pretence of a run away that the other
horses, lagging 25 lengths behind the leader as they
passed the judge’s box for the first time, must have been
taking things quite easily. Because Scot Free was not
under full steam Tartan and others were able to make up
a lot of their lost ground without distressing themselves.
Finally Tartan passed Scot Free and won by a length or
so, Blue Spec being three lengths away, and the time
13sec. slower than for last Melbourne Cup. Put the same
three horses in another Melbourne Oup with lOst. on
their backs, and the worst of them would get over the two
miles in considerably less time than 3.40 f.

So far five riders have qualified for a start in the
final of the Sydney Thousand on March 21st, to wit:
Henri Mayer, A. J. Clark, A. G. Boanas, Dick Arnst, and
Larry Corbett. It isn’t worth while to bet on any of
them. That the average individual who takes only a
casual look in at cycling should bet on the matter is just
plain idiocy. There is no game in the world in which form
tells so accurately; and the men who make a close study
of it seem to the uninitiated to have an absolutely occult
power of picking them. For instance, in the second heat
of the semi-final of the Sydney Thousand on Saturday
night, Larry Corbett’s admirers were so enthusiastic
about him that they offered two to one he would win be-
fore the heat started. After Hagney fell, some enthusi-
asts offered to bet ten to four that Corbett would win, and
frantically begged anybody to take them up. And their
favorite justified their faith in him by breaking away at
the shilling stand and romping home easily. In the fourth
heat the casual person who has seen the brilliant Rutt
streak away like a flash looked round to see if any
fool was mad enough to lay odds against him. He
found himself surrounded by dour-looking men who study
form and make a business of it, and who have the latest
information as to whether the champion has a pain under
hisweskitor not. They are not loud-mouthed, vocifer-
ous men like the layers of odds on the racecourse (betting
is not allowed at the Sydney Thousand), and they talk
business quietly. They admitted that Rutt had a good
chance, but thought some of the local talent would pip
him on the post—young Pye was a good flyer. They
would bet 2 to 1 Rutt would not win the heat—or if the
gentleman liked he could have 10 to 4. Sometimes the
gentleman did—sometimes he didn’t. And again insight
and careful study justified themselves. The German
champion was apparently riding splendidly, and at the
shilling stand he streaked away. But as the cognoscenti
had foretold (and they had staked their money on their
prophecy) he had taken too much out of himself, and A.
J. Clark, of Victoria, who had 25yds. start of him, and
whom he had previously caught and passed, went out
after him at the members’ stand, and beat him by inches
across the line. But consider how they must have sat up
o’nights to work out form to six inches on the line. It is
wonderful, yet the honesty of cycling is above suspicion—
so much above it that if it fell from its proud elevation it
would break its neck.

It is announced in Brisbane that his Ex. the
Governor is to play in a cricket match there, and it is
further stated :
“The team in which his Excellency will play will con-
sist of professional gentlemen who have, in the past,
taken part in first-class cricket. The opposing team will
be styled ‘ All Comers.’ ”
His Ex. only plays with “professional gentlemen,” and
the chances are his team will be defeated, through falling
over its own dignity, and coming down on the glittering
pomp of its own ear. The other crowd is to be All Comers
or Miscellaneous—presumably a mere assemblage of Blokes
who, having no need of professional dignity, can be
selected purely on their merits. Unless it is made high
treason to bowl his Ex., the odds seem to be with the
Blokes. But perhaps the Governor’s friends will select
the Blokes.

At time of writing there was no information
available as to what Melbourne Cricket Club intended to
do about appointing a representative to the Board of Con-
trol for Australasian Cricket. The time during which
an appointment could be made expired on Tues-
day night last, when this paper was rushing to
the press. As both Tasmanian and South Australian
Associations bad started a climbing down movement, it is
possible that the Melbourne Club will cave in. On the other
hand, in the interests of the Board of Control, it is to be
hoped the Melbourne C.C. stands out—the smashing of
the Melbourne Club will give the Board a lot of kudos.

Waverley still holds place of pride in Sydney
First Grade Cricket Premiership Competition, with 13
points. Burwood comes close on its heels with 12, Glebe
is within striking distance with 11. Behind that they
don’t count. Saturday saw four centuries made, and
some excellent averages with the ball also. The tide of
battle ended with Waverley beating Central Cumberland
by 10 wickets ; University downed Paddington by 47 runs ;
Gordon rubbed Middle Harbor in the mud with a 210 runs
victory; while Burwood treated Balmain similarly with
an innings and 30 runs. Glebe beat North Sydney by 18
runs, and Redfern, where the Syrians are, beat Sydney
District by 58 runs.

On the Saturday when the tenth round of
Victorian pennant cricket concluded, leaving Hawksburn
practically assured of the premiership, the only century
put up was that of Seitz, of East Melbourne, who had
just been selected Rhodes scholar for Victoria. He
notched 106 not out against the bowling of Saunders,
Warne and Collins, of Carlton.

Melbourne Cricket Club’s team, playing against
Southland (Maoriland), scored 535 against 99 and 78.
Besides making 335 off his own bat for the M.C.C., Arm-
strong took most of the opposing wickets, and thereby
showed that it was waste of time and trouble playing the
remaining- ten men. Armstrong was equal to tackling
the Southland crowd all by himself.

Sydney Church of England Grammar School
continues its victorious career in the Great Public Schools
premiership, and on Saturday fell on the Scots College, at
North Sydney, like an avalanche. The Scots made 118 in
their first innings, and then the Episcopalians got going.
Massie made 119, Blaxland 118, Minnett 101, and the
innings ended with the colossal score of 481. Scots’
second innings was terrible, and wiped out all memories
of Bannockburn. Minnett bowled the first three batsmen
with consecutive balls, accomplishing the hat trick, and
finished up by taking eight wickets for 11 runs. Edwards
took the other two at a cost of 12 runs, and the innings
ended with 24, making the Episcopalians victors by an in-
nings and 339 runs. At Parramatta, Sydney Grammar
School walloped King’s School by 265 runs, and Newington
beat St. Joseph’s College by 131 runs. These school boys
have been doing big things lately.

Saturday last saw several football clubs playing
practice matches—just getting their feet in as it w 7 ere,
and all through the suburbs there’s a hum of preparation,
and the voices of secretaries are heard inquiring where
men who can kick goals from sharp angles are to be
found. Unfortunately, they are as rare as hash-towers
where the cooking is good.

After all, neither St. George nor Manly Club
will be admitted to Sydney First Grade Rugby boofball
competition, and with a view to concentrating the first-
class talent, it is probable that Eastern Suburbs and
Sydney will be amalgamated. Sydney Rugby is beginning
to reap the rew'ard of its carelessness of the interests of
the game in the schools, and there is a sad dearth of pro-
mising new players. The Australian game is annexing
all the promising young talent. The Metropolitan Rugby
Union will have to take an intelligent interest in the
birthrate, so to speak. The Australian football game in
Sydney is evidently under very shrew'd management,
and in addition to securing the schools as recruiting
grounds, it is also enlisting the active sympathies of the
girls. Besides providing sport on the match-ground,
the League runs moonlight excursions, at which
excellent tea, first-class music, and other accessories are
supplied with wild liberality. A League that combines
the cultivation of brawn with the encouragement of senti-
ment, and puts the girls in the way of receiving pro-
posals, must prevail over its slower rivals.

The fact that Saturday saw the last of the
Prince Alfred Yacht Club’s races for the season rouses a
feeling of regret. The club always provided interesting
racing, and there was no pleasanter w 7 ay of passing a
Saturday afternoon than on board its steamer watching
the great winged yachts straining every halyard for pride of
place. Saturday’s race was altogether charming ; pleasant
people, first-class music, green sunlit water, a sky of tur-
quoise flecked over with amethyst-tinted clouds, and a
warm fresh wind that sent little foam-caps racing over the
shimmering surface. Seven yachts started for the Jenny
trophy and four for the cruisers’ race. The fact that
handicaps were given at the start, although it did not
provide the picturesque element to the same degree
that the flying start does, made the racing much easier
to follow, and of more interest to the mass of
onlookers. Scotia and Fleetwing flung out ballooners,
but the manoeuvre was apparently not a success.
Kukuburra, with 12 minutes start, walked through
the water at an imposing rate, but appearances are decep-
tive, and rounding the buoy at Manly the fleet had,
roughly, cut out half her handicap. The run to Shark
Island brought out all the extras, and the fleet continued
to close up. At the Island Sunbeam was only 4min. 49sec.
behind, having made up 6min. llsec., with 5£ nautical
miles still to go. At Fort Denison the lead had been re-
duced to 3min. 56sec., but it was enough—the Kukuburra
got back round the island and came romping home with
2min. 34sec. still in hand. A long chase and a close one,
and one that spoke volumes for the efficiency of the
handicapping. The second and third boats were Sunbeam
and Magic. The Cruisers’ race was won by the scratch
boat, Herreshoff, after an exciting contest, by 3min.
36sec., with Astroea and Thalassa second and third.

When Mr. Binnie’s Bona beat Mr. Pittar’s
Rawhiti over an inside course in Port Jackson there was
a wide-spread opinion that over an outside course tl e
newer yacht would prove the better boat. As the ownei s
W3re just as interested as anyone else, a match was socn
arranged, and it came off on Saturday over a 19-mile
course. Mr. Marks and his expert crew from the yacht
Cuhvulla took charge of the Rawhiti, and Mr. Fred.
Doran was again in charge of the Bona. The breeze was
light right through, but inside the harbor it was very
fluky, and a heavy rolling swell was met between the
Heads and for some distance outside. They started in a
slack tide and light wind, and ballooners boomed out to
Bradley’s Head, where the Bona bumped the ground, but
was not delayed. Then across to the western shore,
through Watson’s Bay, where the Rawhiti skipper showed
the better judgment and led the way through the Heads,
by lmin. 42sec. Outside the Bona gained for a bit,
and then Rawhiti broke away again, but rounding the
mark wide it allowed Bona to pull up somewhat. All
the same it was still leading by 4min. Then the
ocean was blotted out by the spreading of their extras,
and the towering Rawhiti began to move slightly faster
through the water. But there was apparently not nearly
enough wind to show the boat at its best. As a picture the
sight would have been hard to beat. South Head was
black with people watching the two white etchings on
an azure sea streaked with purple, and the steamer New-
castle and a number of yachts and motor launches gave a
touch of vivacity to the scene. Rawhiti ran wide of the
North Head, and led up the crowded harbor in the sunset
light, looking like a gigantic creation in ivory. Then as
it passed Bradley’s and caught the change in the failing
breeze, the spinnakers and balloon jibs were folded wing-
like, and the boat with the Maori cognomen glided up to
the judge’s boat close hauled, 6min 48sec. ahead of Bona.
This, minus the rating allowance, made Rawhiti winner
by 6min. 16sec.

N.S.W. Amateur Swimming Association should
sternly suppress the craze for high diving that is being
worked up by various clubs in the unholy interests of
Gate. Every week finds the platforms creeping a little
higher, each club striving to outdo the other in sensa-
sational display, and already there have been some
horrible noises heard when the plungers failed to strike
the water correctly. If the craze continues, some fine
afternoon a startled audience vvill be shocked by the sight
of a diver falling on his stomach, and—well, what might
follow is not pleasant to think about. Swimming as a
sport and an exercise is enjoyable and commendable;
high-diving is a juggle with death that is not useful, and
is only entertaining in the sense that it is a juggle with
death. If some wild athlete undertook to dive 50ft. on
to dry land he would probably be regarded by a certain
class as very entertaining indeed.

Arthur B. Postle is still the draw-card in Wes-
tralian professional pedestrianism. In the second Perth
Athletic Carnival, which spread over four nights, Postle
easily won the 100yds. championship in lOsec. ; which,
considering that he had just been downed in several other
events, was a marvellous performance. Immediately
afterwards he had to give up through illness caused by
running himself to pieces in a series of wild chases after
long markers. The £lOO Perth Oup was won by the
favorite, Hayden ; and C. Harrington scooped the 220yds.
handicap and 120yds. hurdles. Just now Westralia has
gone dotty over flat racing, and the meetings are rushed
by the whole population.

Chances of a match for the sculling champion-
ship between Stanbury and Towns, or anybody else, have
fallen very flat. Stanbury’s terms have knocked all in-
terest out of the sport for a while. The ex-champion is
not the least concerned at those terms, and, while his chal-
lenge on fair conditions still goes begging, plugs along in
his boat-shed. The three shells used in the recent Amateur
Sculling Championship were Towns’ handicraft.'

The Skuthorp-Martini buckjumping contest has
again shifted its venue, this time from the Supreme
Court back to Martini’s ground, where, on Saturday
night, Willie Waite wall try to ride, among others, Sku-
thorp’s Dargan’s Gray—the ferocious yellow outlaw'.
The other pole of the attraction wall be Skuthorp’s
attempt to nde the redoubtable Bobs, and two others of
Martini’s man-eating neddies. Altogether there will be
six buckjumping contests.

The Errol-Walcott disturbance at Sydney
National Sporting Club last week was fairly interesting
while it lasted ; the worst thing about it was its brevity.
As the men were filling an unexpected breach, owing to
the collapse of the Cripps-Blackmore fight, at very
short notice, there was no time for preparation. This
fact told most on the white man, for the colored brudder
is a quiet-living slogger who keeps himself in a state of
perpetual preparation. Errol towered over his French-
mustard-colored rival, whose chest development is beauti-
ful to behold. The white was also armed with a longer
reach, and looked heavier. At firstglance the colored man
had, apparently, no hope ; and the start of the fighting
showed that the Aryan had superior skill as W'ell as
superior height and reach. In the end, it was found that
the brown man had most of the pluck and strength.
Over and over again the Ethiopian seemed to be done,
but, somehow', the Aryan never follow'ed up his advantage
to any great extent, and the brown inhabitant returned
to his incessant tapping at the nose, from w'hich blood
was trickling. Continual tapping on the proboscis will
wear away any boxer, and Errol was sadly out of condi-
tion ; so after five rounds, in which he had repeatedly
been within an ace of winning, and had all the best of the
points. Errol requested his seconds to throw in the towel
after they had finished wiping his face with it.
Errol is a draughtsman, and of considerable
education. It is said he took to the boxing ring with a
view to making a certain sum of monev, and after he has
made it he will leave the game. But, like most educated
fighters, he has a dislike for punishment that will pro-
bably do much to prevent the accumulation of the shekels.
The man who expects to carry his nose into the drawing-
room of society likes to keep it a presentable nose, while
the man who only intends to carry his nose to a back
street in Paddington doesn’t care so much what sort of
nose it is.

The reason the Blackmore-Cripps fight fell
through was not because either belligerent had suddenly
joined the Salvarmy, nor was there any falling away of
the fighting spirit. Blacltmore’s leg was poisoned, and
the trouble turned out more severe than expected. So
the conflict is postponed, not abandoned.

The only gleam of comfort about Australasian
champion Tim Murphy’s debacle at Jewhannesburg
emanates from the fact that the stubborn Maorilander
put up something in the way of a record in taking pun-
ishment before he was beaten into a state of insensibility.
Mike Williams was at least a stone heavier, and, to make
matters worse, Timothy Murphy found himself up against
a man whose style of fighting w'as as terrible as it was
unique. Williams simply got in close, pressing his body
against Murphy’s, and beat the Maorilander up and down
the spine and over the kidneys, a la Du Chaillu’s gorilla.
This was the sort of attack from which a clinch afforded
no respite—it merely facilitated the administration of
punishment, in fact. It was a weird kind of fighting, and
Murphy stood it for six awful rounds, when Williams sud-
denly drew aw'ay and, drawing back his right arm, whirled
himself round on his toes. The whole weight of the horrible
manoeuvre landed right on Tim’s hitherto untouched
stomach, and the Australian champion rolled to the floor
insensible. It was a great display of pluck and endur-
ance, but the chances are that Tim Murphy will never be
the same man again—no man ever is after that kind of
dog-walloping, and McOoll will have more than Buckley’s
historic show if he can induce the Maorilander to enter
the ring with him once more.

Edwin Green, Esq., bantam champion of Aus-
tralia, nearly lost his topknot on Saturday evening at
Sydney Gaiety Club. In fact, his championship was the
only thing that didn’t go astray that sweltering night;
he iost the fight, he lost the big end of the purse, and
what beauty of countenance he had when he entered the
b hiding had totally disappeared when he left. The
opposite party was a colored gentleman named Moodie,
known by the nickname of “Ranji,”and he showed a
regrettable lack of respect for the dominant race. About
half-way through the scrap, which went the full 20
rounds, Green pulled himself together, and the atmo-
sphere grew very torrid. In the last two rounds the
c Jored man from Victoria plugged Green every time, and
although he failed to knock him out, secured the verdict.
But for the fact that Moodie was over Bst. 21b. Green
would have ceased to be champion.

“ Snell ”: The worst kind of luck, or something,
seems to attend the boxing game in Melbourne,
so that the really good exhibitions are always given
before scrappy audiences, and the hopelessly bad ones
before great, hopeful crowds that have dumped down a
ton of money in expectation of a thrilling mill. Squires
and Kernick drew an Exhibition-full of people and a van-
load of dollars, and the display wasn’t worth ninepence.
Squires v. Williams packed every superficial foot of the
big Oyclorama, and sent the people swarming half-way
up the walls, and they got exactly 85 seconds of fighting.
Ed. Williams, the lithe middleweight, who can hit and
shift with the best of them, waded in to fight that
gum-butt of a thumper, Bill Squires, in his own way, and,
as was inevitable, took the punch that did him in during
the very first mix-up. I cannot escape the belief that
Williams expected it, and his folly is so rank as to call for
bitter language from all interested in the game. He had
an enormous audience. It was up to him to make some-
thing of a fight, if only for show purposes, knowing that a
fiasco would “cruel” the game for months to come, and
he provided the fiasco. These pugs haven’t any sense.
The talk of Squires, as if he were no scientist, is all pappy-
cock. Bill knows enough to put a hand in where there’s
an opening, and to put it in hard, and Williams fought
him in a way that left many openings. The result is that
the disgust of the great paying public is spread all over
the game again.

The Dunlop Motor Tyre scored some remark-
able successes at the recent Motor Racing Carnival on
Florida Beach at Ormond, Daytona (U.S.A.). First and
foremost, Demegot (France) drove two miles in 58 4-ssec.,
equal to 122 J miles an hour, and thus won the gold
Laurel Wreath presented to the first motorist who nego-
tiated two miles in a minute. “ Dunlops ” were again to
the front in the 100 miles championship won by C. Earp
(Eng.) in lhr. 15min. 40 2-ssec., whilst Chevrolet (France)
established a new petrol car world’s record by covering a
mile in 30 3-ssec. on a Dunlop shod car.*
Spruce Smilf, the other day, before the
Women’s Liberal League, contended that an
admixture of a little black blood with the white
had been proved advantageous. He instanced
the “beautiful quadroons and octoroons,” the
products of the marriages of Englishmen and
negresses. Well, Mr. Smith is a family man.
Would he like to grandfather half-castes ? There
is nothing like putting a principle to a personal
test.
Farmers with capital are going into
Queensland at the rate of quite a number weekly,
despite the existence of a Labor Premier and a
Democratic Government. During the past year
nearly 100,000 acres, in areas varying from 100 to
640 acres, have been taken up by new arrivals on
the group system. Philp and “Janny” Leahy
have now almost ceased to allege that capital has
been scared out of the country, and that settlement
made greater strides during their regime of Borrow
and Burst, and Rum, Riot and Ruin.
The horror at Courrieres (France) is the
world’s record in coal-mine disasters. Already
the deaths by fire, explosion, and choke damp are
set down at 1100. As usual, the horror is studded
with tales of unobtrusive heroism ; all the world
over the coal-miner seems to be there in the hour
of stress. One brief mention is of a rescuer who
went into the burning mine 14 times, bringing
back either a live man or a dead one each time.
Then he went in for the fifteenth time—and
never returned. How could a man have died
better ?
Wonderful are the ways of Australian
weather. White Cliffs is usually as dry as the
bones of an Early Christian in a catacomb, but
the other day Peak Tank thereabouts had 4in. of
rain in 20 minutes, and now the population can
look out on 40 miles of water. The population
consists of two, and it had to swim for its life.
From a large section of Queensland comes the
monotonous remark that it is the biggest
flood on record, and the drought-cursed
West is sitting on the roof of its shanty,
and fishing for its precarious grub, all
ordinary communication being cut off. Horrible
dry places in the West have had half-a-foot of rain
dropped on them in one solid mass, and the kind
of creek that used to be a dry furrow, beginning
nowhere, and melting imperceptibly into the great
plain of dust, is now three miles wide, and raging
in a demoniac fashion. If only the weather would
come by instalments instead of all in a heap like
this, the Australian interior would be a great
place.

CIGAR TO
EQUAL THEM.’
Mr. HENDERSON, J.P., writes:—
|| “ Effingham, Crawley Down, Sussex.
“ Dear Sir,—Thank you for so kindly sending my Marsuma Cigars. Having
smoked for something like 40 years, I can safely say I have never met with one to
I equal them.—Yours truly, “J. HENDERSON.”
The Marsuma has already the largest sale of any cigar in England. Its intrinsic merit has recommended
it everywhere. A cigar that has received praise from Lord Kitchener, Sir Henry Irving, Right Honorable
the Eai-1 of Dunraven, Sir Edmund Barton, and the hundreds of other well-known men, must be something
out of the ordinary.

MAGIC POST CARDS.
A Real Novelty
in Post Cards.
THE Latest Craze. Have you seen them yet ?
Better get a packet. At one end of each card
are two round holes, one containing green transparent
paper—the other red. The scenes on these Post
Cards have been printed by a new process, with the
most novel effect that an entirely different scene is
observed with each color looked through. For in-
stance—by observing one card through the green a
most beautiful girl is seen ; the red, however, brings
to the gaze a decrepit old woman. Many other
equally astonishing contrasts. Price only Is. 6d. per
doz., Post Free.

Australians! Wear Hats
Sf?« AOstral Hat M>H&-
THE Foreign Trader has got wrath in his eye. Aus-
tralians are beginning to wake up and patronise
their own manufacturers. There’s a great run on
Hats made by the Austral Hat Mills, Melbourne.
Worst of it is (from the Foreign Trader’s point ol
view) they’re better Hats than those imported. Our
Hats —in both Hard and Soft Felts —are made of pure
sterilized fur throughout, very light and comfortable
to the head. They' look first class, and are as good as
they look. They are made by Australian workmen
paid full union wages and working eight hours a day.
No sweat shop shoddy about them —just good honest
Hats worth every penny of their price. They are sold
by Hatters, Tailors and Storekeepers all over the
Commonwealth. Every High Grade Hat has our full
name stamped on the inside leather. At the back of
every Hat bearing our name is our guarantee of good
service. Ask your Dealer for one of these Hats. Insist
upon having one of the Austral Hat Mills make—the
best that is—that’s good enough for you, isn’t it?
Don’t let him side track you on to something else.
If your Dealer doesn’t stock our Hats it is because
others show him a larger profit, but give you less
value. In such a case write to us, giving the names
of Dealers in your district, and we’ll arrange that you
will be supplied.

H. W. Gartrell, B.A., B.Sc., the South
Australian Angus scholar, who is now delving out
experience among foreign mines, sends home a
word concerning the country which, according to
Bruce Smith, “welcomes all-comens” : —
I was obliged »o leave Idaho (United States), as I found
that the law of that State prohibited a mining company
from employing any alien.
“Ped.” proves that an old wrong is still
in full working order
In the “Manual of Public Examinations” (1906), the
following- question is quoted from the Junior geography
paper : “ Describe in not more than 15 lines for each—
(1) Nicaragua, (2) Mesopotamia, (3) Rhodesia, (4) Murray
River from Mildura to its mouth.” Here is the comment
of the examiners : “ Answers to this question disclosed a
widespread ignorance of Australia’s chief river. Much
better accounts were given of Nicaragua, Mesopotamia
and Rhodesia.” Question 6 was : “ Give an account of
the climate of Australia.” Comment: “ This question
was repeated from last year, but, as a general rule, the
answers this year were just as indefinite and unsatisfac-
tory as formerly. Some candidates sent in little more
than a list of the various mountains, plains, etc., not
bearing in the least on the climate of Australia." I met
a young student who had gained the prize in his class for
history'. He knew all about Cardinal Wolsey and the
Earl of Strafford and Oliver Cromwell; but nothing of
George Grey ! He had, certainly, heard of Henry I’ark 68,
and- had a notion that he was “ out here once.” Can we
expect national sentiment to develop quickly under such
training?

Queensland is going to boom, and it will
boom, not on the artificial and unstable basis of
loans, but on its own resources.”— Joshua Bell,
Q. Minister for Lands.
Blackheads and open pores are, unfortunately,
a trouble, worry, and disfigurement to many Australian
women. Sufferers from this facial blemish will be pleased
to know that a positive cure has been discovered. Miss
Rubinstein, of Valaze fame, secured many new prepara-
tions during- her recent trip to Europe, but the best of
them all is this marvellous preparation, which is com-
pounded b.v the famous Dr. Lykuski, who also discovered
the beautifying properties of the herb from which Valaze
itself is made. This blackhead cure, if persevered in for a
little time, will effectively remove the worst and most
obstinate case. It is used by many eminent medical skin
specialists in Europe, and such an authority as the matron
of the Newcastle (N.S. W.) Hospital, writes most
enthusiastically in its favor. Used in conjunction with
the Valaze skin-food, which allays all irritation, freckles,
wrinkles, tan, sunburn &c., the beauty-giving complexion-
preserving combination is complete. The Valaze pre-
parations, which are all genuine imported remedies, are
doing" much to maintain that beauty of complexion for
which Australian women are so deservedly famous.*

YOU CANNOT CUT YOURSELF WITH THE
Figaro Safety Razor
A HIGHEST-CLASS HOLLOW-GROUND RAZOR
WITH ATTACHABLE SAFETY GUARD.
Shaves Close and
Comfortably.
6/6
S?3Z
S 3
You can do with a shave less every week and
save five minutes off every shave.
JUST THE thing FOR A MAN in a hurry
Shave Yourself and run no risk of Barber’s Rash.
]Vd" ANY Safety Razors have been invented, but most of them
have failed when put to the practical test of daily use.
Some are too complicated, nearly all need very careful adjust-
ment, others are difficult to handle, and with most of the
Safety attachments there is danger of spoiling the edge of the
razor. The Figaro Safety Razor has none of these objection-
able qualities. In the first place, it is an excellent razor of
the usual pattern that alone would be wonderfully cheap at
the price we charge for the complete outfit. It is full hollow-
ground and made of the highest quality of steel, specially
tempered to retain its keen edge. It is guaranteed ready for
immediate use without honing or stropping. If for any
reason you wish to use the Figaro Razor without the safety
guard, there is nothing to prevent you from doing so, and you
will find it as good as or better than the best razor you have
ever used. The patent Safety Guard fits upon the razor
Without adjustment of any kind. It cannot he wrongly
attached. It can be fixed or taken off in one moment. The
guard does not cover or interfere with the edge, and thus
there is no risk of gapping or blunting the razor, as with
most safety attachments. When the guard is in position, you
can shave with the greatest freedom and confidence, up
or down, backward or forward, even in a dim light, and get
through so quickly and comfortably that shaving is & plea-
sure. and not an irksome duty. Even if you have nevqr
shaved yourself before you will have no trouble in managing
the Figaro Safety Razor. One of our customer* assures us
that, since using the Figaro Safety Razor, he can shave so
close he can do with two shaves a week, whereas previously
he had to shave three or four times, and he states that he
saves quite five minutes on each shave. The Figaro Safety
Razor is the very thing for those who have to shave in
the shortest possible time. For those who dislike having a
rough, bristly face, the Figaro Safety Razor can be depended
upon to shave closer than the most expert barber, for you
can “ bear on ” the Figaro as heavily as you please without
fear of cutting the skin. The Figaro Razor and Safety Guard
are packed in a strong case, with separate compartments for
each piece, and with full directions for use. The price is only
6s. 6d. complete and carriage paid to any address. By shaving
yourself you will avoid all risk of Barber's Rash and save the
cost of the outfit In a couple of months. With each order
received within two months from the date of this paper we
will present a large cake of the Finest American Witch-
Hazel Antiseptic Shaving Soap, that makes sharing a
luxurious enjoyment. You should order at once and must
mention this paper to avoid disappointment. Obtainable

' " • THE WILY BLOOMER.
[For The Bulletin.]
(“An error crept into our issue of .”— Any daily
paper any day.)
Did you ever know an error that could run ?
Or a bloomer that did anything- but creep ?
“ In our issue yesterday we unfortunately say
That Mr. T. J. Smith has fall’n asleep.
We regret it very much, indeed we do,
But the error crept right in as you may see.
Mr. Smith called in at five, and he’s very much alive.”
Is the lucid explanation of the “ we.”
See the error take its socks off in the street,
Or the lie remove its bluchers at the door ;
Note them pass the sleeping “sub” on their hands and
knees, and rub
Their hands with sinful rapture as the}- score.
Watch them dodge the dozing “ devil ” and the comps.,
Pray observe them snatch a “ stick” and get to work
As they “set” the little myth, that Mr. T. J. Smith,
Being dead, will be a sad loss to the kirk.
Some day soon, maybe, the lies will gallop fast ;
In the future, p’raps, they’ll come in motor-cars.
They may rush in, wearing boots, blowing horns and
playing flutes,
Demanding a sub-leader—scorning pars.
Then the modern serib.-s will all be built to match.
“ Yesterday we told a lie as black as night;
It didn’t come in cr uvling, it was standing up and
bawling,
And we’re cussing at the staff with all our might.”
m.l. Claude Jewell.

The late Frederick Haddon, till within recent years
editor of the Argus, was voted a decent fellow by free-
lance journalists in Melbourne, and freelance journalists
are not easy to please in the matter of editors. He was of
much the same class as Arthur Windsor, lately of the Age,
with a pleasant literary side, not often discoverable in the
newsmongery business men of later dates. Both had
some sympathy for the disreputable detached litterateur,
who is often not fit to be seen, but just as often well
worth hearing. A few years back Haddon made a bid for
the encouragement of Australian story-tellers, and ran a
series of local productions in the Wednesday Argus. This
led to the appearance of a few “characters” about the
prim Argus office. One freelance was written to. The
editor wished to see him. The reply was, “Can’t come.
No trousers.” This drew a cheque for a guinea. Still the
writer did not appear, but he sent word : “ Thirst satisfied.
Better send the trousers.” The trousers were sent, but
Haddon presently regretted it. That particular writer
was only productive when he had no trousers.
* * * •
On the death of F. W. Haddon, the comfortable and
lucrative job of representing the Wilson interest on the
Argus proprietary—a very well-paid sinecure—falls to
David Watterson, the Argus editor. “Ted” Cunning-
ham succeeds to the editorial chair, and sub-editor Nish
becomes associate editor.
* * , * *
Deceased F. W. Haddon was one of the slowest
writers on the Australian press. While ARous editor
he rarely wrote anything the size of an article 1
without taking a day to think it over. As for letting 1
“slips” go until he had the whole stack ready, that was -
out of the question. On the other hand, he could dash 1
through other people’s copy with a fine, reckless rapidity 1
which sometimes made a sentence unintelligible to the
author. In the chair of the Australasian he did better
work personally than in that of the Argus. In the latter j
position he was almost wholly dominated by club i
influences.
A.B. Knew the late Alf. M‘Kain well, a few years
ago when we were on the staff of Melbourne Age
together. M Kam was a journalist—as opposed to a
literary genius—but his ability was'seriously discounted
by his excitable nature. With a different temperament,
he might have been another Harmsworth, so keen was his
sense of news and so- excellent his method of*handling •
it. As a writer, he was. little more than a recorder of
evepts, but he knew what events to jrecord. M‘Kain
left the Age to start a Labor weekly called the
Boomerang, which died of vacancy in the sto-
mach after three months. He had with him
as foreman printer, Prendergast, the present leader
of the Vic. Labor party, and, as co-editor, Leslie
Norman, ex-shipping reporter of Melb. Argus, who, later
swelled into a mining magnate in Westralia. M‘Kain
and Norman had a lively time with their little effort to
improve mankind. The pajoer, it was 'afterwards dis-
covered, started operations with a capital of little more
than £lO, and before the first issue was out the office
boy had bowled in a summons for his unpaid
week’s wages. Whenever I called to. see McKain I
encountered strange delays, and there were mysteri-
ous runnings backwards and forwards before I
was admitted ; and I used to fraternise on the mat
with irate whiskered persons, who made vile threats as to
the means they intended adopting to get their money. !
The literary staff used to exist on a threepenny lunch at
the rooms of the W.C.T.U.’s restaurant, close at hand,
and slept in the office those nights when it was not
engaged folding papers. The Boomerang had a mute
inglorious existence, but it served M‘Kain well in the
matter of experience, and, after editing a Kerang journal
for some months, he returned to Melbourne and raised
sufficient capital to bring out the Adelaide Critic in a
decent manner. After his break down, the Critic fell
away from journalistic grace with a deadly slump.

The Gadfly, the new S.A. weekly, run by C. J. Dennis
A. E. Martin and Beaumont Smith, made a" good start by
practically selling out its first number on the day of
issue. There should be a good opening for a paper of the
kind in Tortoise Town, where the weeklies are of a trulv
tortoisey description, and the enterprising young owners
should make a good thing of it.
* * * *
T. J. Lauder takes up the editorial duties of Barrier
Truth. When Lauder left Australia for America, about
12 months ago, he belonged to that short-sighted section
of the Labor party which maintains “there’s nothing in
Protection.” He went to the U.S. a sort of “ Free-tec-
tionist,” and returned—after seeing what - the Uncle Sam
tariff has done for the Americans—a pronounced Hio’h
Tariffist, and convinced that Protection means National-
ism.

Sydney Mail, February 28, answered “ Inquirer ” thus :
“ Mr. Jellico’s libels on New South Wales were published
in the Liverpool Post (England) and appeared in the:
S.M. Herald’s cable news on September 22 and October 2
of last year.” Only that and nothing more. How natu-
rally and how promptly libels on the State found their
way into the S.M.H.’s columns about the dates stated.

There is a wise recognition of journalistic custom in-
the decision of the English Appeal Court that a news-
paper cannot be forced to divulge the name of a con-
tributor. Journalistic confidence in practice is. just as
sacred as that of priest or doctor, and deserves the same
degree of legal recognition.

N.S.W. Government Gazette is in future to be issued
only once a week, which seems quite enough. It is a fear-
fully wasteful publication, the bulk of the space being
taken up by an elaborate recital, over almost every para,
graph, of the style, pomp, dignity, circumstance and
title of the Governor, and an elaborate specification of
how, by divine assistance, and with the moral support of
Edward VII. and the aid of the Ministry and two Houses
of Parliament it has been decided to cancel somebody’s
conditional purchase or to appoint a new under-gardener
at ss. per day. And when a billet worth having is vacant,
the Gazette is as dumb as an ox until it briefly mentions
that Johnson has got the job.

The tenth edition of the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica ” is
just going to begin, and the startling announcement is
made that the British edition will be printed in America 1
Again the blessings of Freetrade !
The Farmer and Settler, a bright, new agricultural
weekly, effectively satirises, in a recent issue, the amount
of twaddle that the Sydney dailies now devote to the.
“man on the land” and to special “ woman stuff.” In
truth, the Sydney daily blankets approximate more and
more to the type of havseed weeklies.

Editing is a remarkably easy job where a royal person
is concerned. Queen Alexandra is solemnly announced
as editor of a charity volume contributed to by leading
writers and artists. Her editorial labor seems to have
consisted in informing the Deputy Chief Cockroach-
chaser, or some such exalted official, that she would be
graciously pleased to allow her name to take first place
on the title-page.

London half-penny Express splashed over the recent
British elections with an unprecedented splash. Simul-
taneously with the results a portrait and a biography of
every successful candidate was given, and the public thus
got particulars of the whole 670 odd members as soon as
they were returned. As there were over 1400 candidates
this “ scoop ’’.was only possible by the money-soaking
process of making a photo.-block and writing’ a biography
of every man in the crowd, and finally, on the closing of
the polls, throwing three-fifths of the lot into the W.P.B.

Typhoid’s After Effects
A Relapse and a Radical Cure.
The Case of Mrs. T. Vaughan.
(BY A LOCAL REPORTER.)
Probably many who have hitherto played the
onlooker’s part have been sharply taught by ex-
perience, that the trials of life possess an arm of
far-reaching propensities, and in such instances,
where a personal interest has been aroused, much
pleasure will be found in reading the conversation
which took place between our representative and
Mrs. Teresa Vaughan, of No. 39 Elizabeth-street,
Camperdown, who said :
. ‘4 The first sickness I ever had in, my life came
to me six years ago, and it was a very severe ill-
ness, too.” _ _ t
“ What was it? ” asked the writer,
“It was ■an attack of typhoid that had
laid me low, and I had taken a turn for the
better, and was getting on fine, when I
made the mistake of leaving my bed too
soon. A relapse was the consequence, _ and,
of course, I had ■to take to my bed again. I
believe I was worse then than before, for the pains
which came to my head were frightful. Those in
the house told me that often I was quite delirious,
so that will give you an idea of how bad I was.
Well, I had been losing and losing flesh till at
last there was no more to waste away, nothing'
being left of me but a portion of my former self.
Everybody who saw me thought that my case was
hopeless, and I’m sure I thought so, too, but the
old saying that ‘ while there is life there is hope ’
proved to be a true one in my case. It was when
I was so ill that I couldn’t possibly have been
worse—scarcely able to move myself, in fact, that
a friend of mine, a lady about seventy, told me
what a grand thing Clements’ Tonic was, and
that it would be sinful not to give it a trial.
Well, what could I say ? Nothing had done
me any good so far, so could I expect
this one remaining remedy to benefit me ? I
asked myself. My friend’s persistent ‘ Give it a
trial ’ answered the question for me, so I sent for
some Clements’ Tonic that day. I don’t suppose
you’ll believe this, but it is perfectly true—the
very day I first took Clements’ Tonic the retching
stopped, and if that didn’t make me joyful nothing
would. Oh ! I was so thankful, for I knew then
that so long as I persevered with Clements’ Tonic
there was still a hope for me left. My friends
were almost spellbound with amazement, and
when I told them that Clements’ Tonic had also
created a feeling of hunger within me they could
hardly believe their ears, they said. But I had
still more to boast about, for this latest medicine
of mine had brought me such general relief from
pain, that it was as much as I could do to
realise that I was the same woman who so
recently had endured such a great amount of
torture. My chest had been very badly affected
with the weightiness that was almost unbearable,
but in a week or two I was quite free from it.”
“When you had taken some solid food what
were your feelings like ? ”
“Well, at first I did not feel too comfortable,
but after a while, and by taking Clements’ Tonic
regularly, the overburned sensations passed away,
and eventually my stomach became so strong that
I could eat anything, and never had the least
unpleasantness to contend with afterwards.
Why, the agony I used to endure from windy
spasms was something terrible, but Clements’
Tonic eradicated them for good. Several
times a day, too, I was subject to fits
of uncontrollable giddiness—the room seemed
to be turning round and round, and then
everything would go dark for a space;
but even to this trouble Clements’ Tonic proved to
me my staunch and only friend. My eyes used to
feel much larger than they should have been, so
heavy, and so defective in sight, too—and you
only wanted to catch a glimpse of the whiteness of
my tongue to understand what a disordered state
my internal organs were in. And what a terrible
taste I had in my mouth ! As though I had been
drinking gall, even after I had rinsed it out with
vinegar and water, which I often did. But there,
what a small matter Clements’ Tonic made of these
things, besides which it soothed me so well that I
soon got a sound rest every night without any of
the fearful dreams that used to terrorise me.
There is no doubt when I first used Clements’
Tonic I was as near the portals of death as I could
be. I earnestly hope this account of my recovery
will come under the notice of delicate women, so
please publish ‘this in any way you may think fit.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Teresa Vaughan, of No. 39 Elizabeth-street,
Camperdown, in the State of New South Wales,
Commonwealth of Australia, do solemnly and
sincerely declare that I have read the annexed
document, and that it contains and is a true and
faithful account of my illness and cure by
Clements’ Tonic, and also contains my fall per-
mission to publish in any way my statements —
which I give voluntarily, without receiving any
payment—and I make this solemn declaration
conscientiously believing the same to be true and
by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1900.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MRS. QUADE went noiselessly but
quickly about the rooms. She had
dressed herself smartly in the hand-
somest frock she possessed that was for travel.
Her hair was carefully done as Carlton liked it.
There was even a touch of carmine on her lips and
a suggestion that the hare’s foot had brushed her
cheeks ever so lightly.
She was quite ready, hat, gloves, furs and all,
and now she busied herself making a systematic
collection of the valuables she intended carrying
with her. Neither taste nor sentiment influenced
her choice; she selected those articles of least
weight and size and greatest intrinsic worth. The
mother’s relics were cast aside, with the dead
baby’s bangle and Harry’s first gift, the opal
pendant. Her judgment was quite accurate —no
pawnbroker could have done better.
She paused for a moment to examine a silver
waist buckle, her husband’s gift too. It had the
word “Martha” inscribed upon it. She smiled
as she gazed, remembering his words :
“I am quite sure of you, sweetheart. No
woman named Martha could help being a good
wife. A woman named llartha is foredoomed to
fidelity.”
Martha threw the buckle' on the bed with the
other discarded articles, and started to strap the
small trunk. She had no fear of being disturbed.
Quade was safely in his room with his books and
his brandy. If she were to scream “ Murder !” he
would not stir. Should he happen to blunder in
upon her he would not deign to question. It was
long since he had permitted himself to admit that
she existed. Little Mrs. Quade uttered an evil
word as she savagely jerked the second strap.
At that momenta sharp report echoed along the
passage. The woman recognised it, and her face
went deathly white. Never had she anticipated
anything like this. She ran from her room and
along the passage to the third door, opened it
hastily and stepped inside. A reading lamp was
burning on the table, casting a spray of light
through the smoke. The man sat in the shadow.
His head had fallen forward, his right arm hung
by his side, a revolver had dropped from the list-
less fingers. His left arm was on the table. The
fingers held a. slip of paper. All was silent. The
pistol shot had not been heard down stairs.
Mrs. Quade seized the note and read its
message:
My dear Martha.—You see, it is wholly unnecessary.
Martha rolled this into a tiny ball, slipped it into
her pocket, and then permitted herself to scream.

Every child born into the world
with an inherited tendency to tor-
turing, disfiguring humours of the
Skin and Scalp, becomes an object
of the most tender solicitude, not

because of the dreadful fear that
the disfiguration is to be lifelong

prosperity. Hence it becomes the
duty of mothers of such afflicted
children to acquaint themselves
with the best, the purest, and most

warm baths with Cuticura Soap,

‘Wood B.” : lie a recent Bulletin resurrec-

S.A. Register made a careful estimate,
after the whole State’s wheat-harvest was got in, that
(leaving hay out of the question) 1,830,000 acres were
reaped for an average of 11) bushels. Total over ‘2l
million bushels—the State’s record. Value, at market
price, £3,200,000. Exportable surplus, say 17) million
bushels, worth £2,500,000. It was found that a difference
of 20 miles frequently made the difference between a
2 bushel or 20 bushel crop, and some S.A. farmers are
actually unable to repay the seed-wheat lent them in
former years, and now due.

Auckland (Maoriiand) City Council has struck
Some more of the beautieS.of the Contract system. The
ancient capital Of Seddon’S land entrusted the removal
of its refuse to a contractor, and after tying that gentle l
man Up by various strips of parchment to bury the debris
on an island in the Upper harbor, it discovered that he
had been a victim Of his employees’ cafelesSrtesS. Many
of these scoundrels had, without his permission and
against his will, saved him much money by shooting the
Stuff into the harbor, whence it drifted back and found
anchorage along the foreshores of the city, with disastrous
results to the health and comfort of the inhabitants. The
contractor was prosecuted and fined £25, but he has saved
several hundred through the perfidy of his subordinates,
so the thinj* pays.
Recent cyclone in N. Queensland let some day-
light in to the profits of the Chow banana ring, which
pretty well controls the trade of Australia. One yellow
buyer estimated his “ loss of profits’" for the next six
months at £16,000, indicating that in an ordinary season
he clears £20,000. Another slant-eyed firm says that it
will lose nearly twice that. Geraldton alone sends away
nearly 2,000,000 bunches a year. Between the Chow and
the shipping company the producer is pretty badly
squeezed, since the latter ring charges lid. per bunch as
freight, or nearly as much as the grower gets.

Some wonderful things happen on the Maori-
iand railways, especially at the bottom end of the
South Island. The whole of a sheep-fanner’s wool clip
for 1905 has gone astray, and frantic efforts are be.ng
made to trace it. The clip of another man was so long
delayed in transit, a while back, that it missed the first
wool sales, and the owner talked at the Department until
he nearly died of apoplexy, because good prices had been
realised. When the second sales came on, however, lus
wool fetched from Id. to l)d. per lb. more than it would
have had it not missed the ’bus, and the pastmalisfc
withdrew his remarks. But this doesn’t comfort the
sufferer whose wool has got altogether lost. The resources
of the British language have given out in his case.

The Directors of the “Bureau of Commercial
Intelligence” hope to be ready for country clients by
Easter. Circulars are being drafted, and ways and means
discussed. It has been arranged that the Bureau’s motto
shall be, “ Always Be Honest.” But the Bureau ? Well,
here is one circular :
“ We handle all sorts of commercial business ; in fact,
we do everything. We buy and sell for clients ;we invest
their monejq collect dividends, transfer and exchange
properties, arrange weddings, rehabilitate characters, and
cure diseases. Our large staff is competent to serve
clients, no matter what the nature of the proposed service
may be li
Here is another
“To persons who have lived many years in the bush
the advantage of such a bureau as ours must be at once
apparent. As soon as you arrive in the city call on us,
or send card or private note and we will look you up.
If serious business, we are yours to command ; if you
merely wish to see what is interesting and amusing in
city life, we adopt and promise to gratify you. Enclosed
extracts from daily papers will show the pitfalls from
which we can save you.”
The extracts recount robberies, assaults, police prose-
cutions, and other incidents of shady night life. Then
the writer proceeds:
“Remember, you are perfectly free. We go around
with you; and guarantee safety under all circumstances.
Be wise. See us. Give your money to us, your jeweT'erv
to us, and tell us your wishes, and we do the rest. That's
our business. Our motto : ‘ Always be Honest.’ ”
The directors have already enjoyed some expensive
luncheons in anticipation of coming success.

“ Kassiteros ”: Often the man who buys tin
is a rogue. He says he buys by assay, but the assay
is generally a fake. Of course he knows what the true
assay value is ; hut you don’t. He tells you 70 per cent,
when it is probably 74 or 75. It is interesting to watch a
“ cronk ” buyer. You will see him give less per ton for
small quantities going above 75 than lie gives for a large
parcel of .tin going under 70 percent. The small man is
most at the rook’s mercy. I have seen a man who car-
ried 401 b. of tin assaying 74‘9, 18 miles, paid less for it
than a man received who had some ewt. to sell, which the
assayer said did not come up to 70 percent. And remember
that all lots are supposed to be paid for on assay. I see
no remedy but for the State to advance on tin and other
ores, and send the stuff in large quantities to the best
markets. As it is, a few fatten on the robbery of the
many. Another robbery indulged in is the collec-
tion of royalties on ore from ground to which the collector
has no ciaim whatever, but which at one time had be-
longed to some co. or swindlecate. This is done every
day. But if The Bulletin alludes to this practice it will
be accused of interfering with private enterprise. lam

write of Timbuctoo.
The advertising fiend may not have disfigured
Eden and driven Adam and Eve into less congenial dig-
gings, but he certainly has been on the move most of the
tittle ever since. Nothing is sacred to the fellow with the
pot of white paint and colossal cheek. The wreck of the
fil-fated Elginshire, oh Normanby beadh (M.L.), may not
be a picturesque ob ect, but for a long time it has been an
item of great curiosity, and its story interests visitors.
But t’other day some vandals rowed out, and in massive
white letters on the side of the vessel extolled the virtues
of somebody’s bike.

Poor Policeman XIX ! It is this way. De

friends sorrow for his departure, and wonder where the
poor fellow has got to. Still it costs money to issue a

How to Make the Liver Act Properly
Rev. Charles Wincott
WHITES :
“Gentlemen, —About three years ago I
was confined to my bed for a short time with
a very acute attack of Liver complaint.
After other medicines had failed to take any
effect, I was recommended by my doctor to
try Kutnow’s Powder, and I am glad to say
that after taking two bottles I was com-
pletely cured, and my health has been
better ever since. I have since recommended
your excellent preparation to quite a number
of sufferers, who testify of similar results.
“(Rev.) CHAS E. WINCOTT.”
(Incumbent of St. Phillip’s Church,
(Adlington, Lancs.)
Dr. THORPE WHITES :
“ Grant Building, Los Angeles.
“ I prescribe Kutnow’s Powder and take
it myself occasionally ; it never fails to bring
about the most gratifying results in the most
pleasant manner.”
Sir J. B. MONCKTON
(Late Town Clerk of London) wrote :
“Guildhall, London, E.C.
“ Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in
stating that for the last two years I have
regularly used Kutnow’s Powder, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks
of lumbago, with other gouty symptoms that
had troubled me for years, seem to have
entirely disappeared. ’ ’
THE FOOD PASSAGES
and ORGANS.
The body is a working machine, and like all other
machines wears away in use. Our bones and muscles, sofiim
and strong, need constant repair to keep them so. For this
purpose food is necessary, and a series of instruments or
organs by which it may be changed into flesh and bone. We
are, therefore, furnished with teeth to chew, palates to taste,
stomachs to digest, livers to aid digestion, and bowels to carry
off the refuse matter. The Liver is the very gateway of
health, the sewage farm, where the poisons are neutralised by
the action of the bile ; it exerts an all-powerful influence on
the mind, temperament, and disposition. If your Liver is
active you are happy and light-hearted, if sluggish you are
crabby and miserable. Kutnow’s Powder will keep the
liver in perfect order.
Important Caution!
All respectable Chemists sell Kutnow’s Powder, but there are others,
who, for the sake of a little extra profit, will attempt to foist upon
you some cheap imitation of their own. It is well known that
these cheap concoctions are highly dangerous, and in the case of
delicate, sensitive persons capable of inflicting permanent injury.
Kutnow’s Powder is pure, painless, palatable, free from sugar, and
absolutely harmless. See that the fac-simile signature, “S. Kutnow
& Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade mark, “ Hirschensprung, or
Deer Leap,” are on the carton in which the bottle is packed, and
also on the label on the bottle. This signature and trade mark
will alone insure your obtaining the
GENUINE Kutnow’s Powder.
CAPTAIN BARCLAY TI
“Kirsteen, Cisbury Road, Brighton.
“ Gentlemen, —You kindly forwarded me
a bottle of your Kutnow’s Powder a short
time ago. I am very unwilling to testify
that things have worked wonders, but really
I cannot speak too highly of it. I have
suffered for years from constipation and liver
troubles. Your powder has done all that it
claimed, and more than that, it has given me
comfort. Its action is sure and gentle, and
at the same time certain, without any dis-
tressing effects. —Faithfully yours,
“R. BARCLAY (Capt.).”
Dr. Tertlus Marks WRITES :
(President of the Texas State Home Medical
Association; Medical Director of the Q. A.R. of
the Department of Texas, Ex-Pension Medical
Examiner, U.S.A.J
“ Having tried your excellent preparation
(Kutnow’s Powder) personally, I am in a
position to say it is as good as it is possible
to conceive.”
Dr. I. N. LOVE wrote:
Late Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases,
Marion-Sims College of Medicine and College
of Physicians and Surgeons, says:
‘ ‘ Kutnow’s Powder stimulates the activi-
ties of the bowels and kidneys, it cleanses
the bowels, dilutes the urine, and flushes
out the kidneys in the most satisfactory way.
Thorough elimination is salvation, and there
is no better eliminator than Kutnow’s Pow-
der. “I. N. LOYE, M.D.”

“ Silver Pern ” writes
Something Is going to happen to the M.L. Arbitration
Court. Trades-unionists aver that the Arbitration Act
has never received sympathetic treatment since the re-
tirement of Justice Williams. Recent decision in the
seamen’s dispute has been worse than a head wind to the
very union which was responsible for the Act being
placed on the Statute book. Two years ago the U.S.S.
Co. promised an increase in wages if business improved
during- the currency of the award then given, but the co.
succeeded in proving to the Court that its directors are
living on dry bread in great poverty, while the sailors are
enjoying the comparative luxury of oysters and stout.
Although 90 per cent, of the seamen are unionists, the
Court consistently refuses them preference, a very sore
point with the men. Considering that the co. cleared
about £lOO,OOO on last year’s trade, and that the price of
living for the worker has risen 30 to 40 per cent, in M.L.,
there seems to be some solid reason for discontent. Pre-
mier Seddon evidently sees a storm in the near offing', as
he worked in a clause in last year’s Amending Act making
jt a punishable offence to incite workers to strike.
Some Bulgarian proverbs :
One does not go to hell to light a cigarette.
Strangers forgive ; parents forget.
If an ass is angry, he runs as fast as a horse.
The smaller saints will be the ruin of God.
God will give, but won’t carry home for you.
Also some popular sayings among the Punjabi
peasantry:—
The jackal was born in August. In September he saw
a flood, and said, “ Never in my life have I seen such a
flood.”
Even Satan prays for protection from girls.
A dog is a lion in his own lane.
A demon took a monkey to wife. The result was, by
the grace of God, the English.
“ Squidge ” : Queenscliff, at the entrance
of Melbourne’s huge harbor, when regarded as a
look-out station, is a more ridiculous proposition
than Queenscliff as a fort. Scores of vessels pass
through Port Phillip Heads without being seen ;
the first heard of them is often when they appear
off Williamstown. That’s bad enough ; but a
much more serious matter is that even a vessel
that wants to be seen, and which hollers with all its
might, sometimes can’t attract Queenscliff’s atten-
tion. When the Australia was wrecked, her
people burnt flares, blew sirens, fifed rockets, and
raised old Harry generally for about three hours
before it occurred to Queenscliff that somebody
wasn’t making all that fuss for fun. The other
week, another such case occurred. A motor
launch, with 15 people aboard, left Sorrento for
the ’Cliff. Some of the works broke down, and
the launch was left drifting. Fortunately the
wind was southerly, and the launch was blown up
to the back of Swan Island, where it anchored for
the night. As it drifted past Queenscliff blue
lights were burned, and frantic efforts were made
to attract the attention of the lookout, or the fort,
or the lighthouse, or the fishermen ; but no an-
swer came. Had the wind been from the north,
the launch would have been blown outside, or
on to the rocks, and several lives would have been
lost. The next time a big vessel hits the Heads and
signals to the’Cliff, and isn’t noticed, it will perhaps
be in the middle of a roaring storm. There will be a
long list of drowned, and then Queenscliff will be
wakened up and made to take an interest.

HEALTH S DANGER
SIGNAL!
DON’T fail to recognise the signal when Natur®
gives it to you. It may be very slight at first;
maybe you will scarcely heed the first tug that Disease
makes at your vitals. Heed the next. It may be
only a slight pain in your back. Its danger lies in
its persistence, and in your inability to shake it off.
It may be a pain in your kidneys or bladder. It may
be your stomach that first tells you of danger. Heed
the warning, in whatever guise it comes.
Wo man shotted be weak. A man’s organs should be as
strong at 40 or SO as at 30 or 35, if he has not abused his con-
stitution. His heart action should be good. His stomach
should digest his food properly. His kidneys should do their
work perfectly and if his nerves are right he is a healthy
man, full of vigor and vitality. Nature did not intend that you
should be a weakling.
Are You a Strong, Healthy Man ?
If you are not, it Is because you have insufficient nerve force.
Like an engine without steam, your organs must fall to act
when the nerve force is wasted. Nerve force means Elec-
tricity, and Electricity is life. You have wasted your nerve
force and before you can get well It must be restored. There
is only one way to restore it. Only one remedy that cures
without fail.

dr. McLaughlin s electric belt
is a sure and certain cure for Nervousness, Debility of the Organs, Weak Back, Prostatic
Enlargement, Kidney or Bladder Trouble, Sciatica, Lumbago and the Weaknesses Peculiar

BACK TROUBLE AND RHEUMATISM.
The Dr. McLaughlin 00. Logan Reserve, KINGSTON, Q.
Dear Sirs,—l am sending you these few lines to assure you how permanent my cure has been. It is
now many months since I have had occasion to wear your High-Grade Belt, as since I wrote you last and
told you how I had been cured of my Back Trouble and Rheumatism after two years of intense suffering,
and inability to walk, I have enjoyed the best of health, and have never had a return of my pains.
Any sceptic can write to me if he wants to know what your Belt did for me, and then he will be a
sceptic no longer. To be cured as I was, after all other remedies had failed, is just marvellous, and I
would be ungrateful indeed if I did not thank you again for all your Belt has done to make life worth living.
Yours gratefully, JAMES LAUGHLIN.
BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, FUNCTIONAL WEAKNESS.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co. NAROOMA, N.S.W.
Gentlemen, —It gives me great pleasure to testify to the benefits received from your treatment. It is
now fifteen months since 1 first experimented and borrowed an Electric Belt for Bronchial Asthma. I
wore it for about eight weeks, and was so well satisfied with the result that I purchased my appliance,
which has given every satisfaction, and for five months I have not had a return of my complaint. 1 believe
that to those who have never used your Belt its curative powers are beyond perception. I could write a
lot about my condition, as I have been very observant, but I will let these few lines suffice for the present.
Yours faithfully, C. H. SNELL.

WHAT IS CATARRH?
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining- membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

CONSUMPTION.
TOO ILL TO LEAVE HIS BED.
A COMPLETE CUBE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be
consumption, and various other treatments had been
tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage that I
heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a
course of the medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
for which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,

SEVERE BRONCHITIS,
COMPLETELY CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS
CURE.
IT ACTED LIKE MAGIC.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —It affords me very much
pleasure to give you an unsolicited testimonial as 'to the
great merits of your wonderful Bronchitis Cure. I can
say without hesitation that as a chest medicine it has no
equal. Having had Bronchitis in a severe form it com-
pletely cured me, and now in the AVinter months if I at
all contract a cold on the chest it gives me instant relief.
I have also proved its efficacy with members of my
family, whom it has always cured of coughs, colds on the
chest, also sore throats. It has acted like magic. Sir,
you are deserving of the best thanks of the community
for introducing to suffering humanity such a valuable
medicine.

Bronchitis Cure afforded me great relief after taking
two doses only. I have since proved its efficiency in
quickly curing a bad cold, and altogether my chest feels
stronger. I can strongly recommend it as the best medi-

COUGH.
DISTRESSING AND HACKING COUGH COMPLETELY
CURED BY A BOTTLE OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —Last winter my youngest
son, Herbert, who is rather weak on the chest, had a dry,
distressing, hacking cough which troubled the poor little
fellow very badly at night time. I tried many so-called
panaceas, without any appreciable effect. But after
using less than a bottle of your Bronchitis Cure I am
pleased to say that the child was cured and is now quite
well, all symptoms of the cough having entirely dis-
appeared. I have had much pleasure in recommending
your magical medicine to my friends.—Believe me to be,
yours very gratefully, R. SHERIDAN KNOWLES,

HOW FOOD CAUSED PAIN
AND DISTRESS IN
THE STOMACH.
SEVERE indigestion
CURED BY
MOTHER SEIGEL’S
SYRUP.
Mr. Thomas Brown, a carpenter,
of Grote St., West Adelaide, writes
under date, March 9, 1905 : “ Bor
several years I suffered frequently
from severe attacks of indigestion.
My food seemed to settle in a hard
solid lump in my stomach ; causing
much pain and distress in my
stomach and right side. It became
extremely difficult for me to stick to
my daily work. I tried several doc-
tors, but their treatment did not help
me. At last on the advice of my
friend, Mr. W. James, the well-known
blacksmith of Currie Street, I used
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. Three bottles
of it completely cured me. That was
a year ago and I have been well ever
since.”
*** Your food zvill oecome nourish-
ing and pleasant and you will have
no pain or distress in your stomach
if you will use Mother Seigel’s
Syrup , either as a cure or as a pre-
ventative. You can get it at all
up-to-date Chemists' shops.

And Ulcerated Sores.
THERE are many cases on record where Zam-
Buk has been used with excellent results for
distressing humors of the skin, and there is
no doubt about the Balm’s highly curative power.
Boils, which are very common affections at this
season, may arise from a debilitated condition of
the system, and generally occur in some part of the
body exposed to friction or chafing. After the
boil has burst, the healing process will
be greatly aided by applying Zam-Buk.
As a striking illustration, Mr. John
,Handy, of 380 Campbell-street,
Rockhampton, Q., says: —“I
have used Zam-Buk Healing
Balm for boils and ulcerated
sores and find it a far
superior article to various
other ointments I have-tried.
A few applications of Zam-Buk brought about
a perfect cure, where other ointments have
entirely failed. I am in the employ of the
Railway Department, Rockhampton, and have
no hesitation in recommending Zam-Buk as an
invaluable healing balm.”
ZAM-BUK is a PROVED CURE for PILES. ECZEMA BOILS RUNNING
SORES, SORE LEGS, RINGWORM, BARCOO, etc. As a HOUSEHOLD BALM

RUB IT
THE SHOAL-LIGHT
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r HERE'S many a quiet place on land,
But ne'er a one can be
So lonesome as this rib o’ sand
Set longwise in the sea.
’ Tis shining sky and shining sea,
The glare 'most turns you blind ;
Yet here I be, and bound to be.
For there's the light to mind.
My God ! ’tis still past all belief.
And smooth as any lake ;
Here on the sands inside the reef.
The seas don’t hardly break.
The lighthouse throws a bit o’ shade—
’ Tis all there is to see.
I watch it till I’lit half afraid
’ Twill rise and come at me.
My mate, he bore it half a year,
And alw t,ys frightened o't;
By then he'd got so mortal queer
He up and cut his throat.
’ Twas in his bunk, his face was white,
But all the clothes were red —
It put me in a kind o’ fright
To sec how much he bled.
I dursn’t put him to the tide,
There’s sharks too nigh at hand;
I had to dig a grave outside
And lay him in the sand.
I dressed him in his Sunday clothes,
And to the grave I’d made
I carried him, and filled it close,
And smoothed it wi' the spade.
I nailed tvjo boards to make a cross,
And wrote thereon ; "Here lay
QUEENSLAND.
The bones of Richard Henry Ross
Until the Judgment Day.”
I set a line of oyster shell,
And then I made it two !
I planted■ each one firm and well ;
What more-like cculd I do ?
For three long days—'twas ■mortal hot —
He rested quietly ;
But on the fourth one up he got
And followed after me,
I never seen him getting out,
I never seen his face ;
All coward-like he lurks about
In every corner place.
He creeps behind me out of sight,
But well I know he’s there ;
He lays a hand as light as light
Upon my lifting hair.
He's close as I go up the stair,
And, turn I ne'er so fast,
Still he’s behind me—God knows where
Or how he slithered past !
He passes quicker than a flash
As I go out and in ;
But I can see the fearsome gash
That gapes beneath his chin.
By day and night my watch I keep
Upon that creeping fear ;
I dare not lav me down to sleep
Lest it should draw too near,
And bend above me in the dark
And whisper me to rise,
And lift upon me, grim and stark,
The horror of its eyes.

A Highland Wedding.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ILIYE amongst a little community of
Highlanders, who, it must be remembered,
are quite different from Scotchmen. Most
of them speak only the poorest of English, and
prefer to converse in “ta Gaelic.” At any of our
little gatherings, if you call out “Mac.” nine out
of every ten heads are at once turned enquiringly
towards you. I always knew that the Highlanders
were the most clannish men on the face of the
earth ; but it was only lately that I discovered
that amongst themselves they were divided into
bitterly hostile factions. I made this entertaining
discovery at MTherson’s wedding.
It was M'Pherson’s daughter (Christina) who
was being married, and the groom was a Macrae.
I went to the wedding in company with my
friend, Dougal Bruce. Dougal, like myself, was
a despised Lowlander, and we both went simply
as spectators. The inner circle of Highland
revelry was not for us, and we didn’t regret the
fact.
At first everything was as decorous as the most
sedate Sassenach function. At the kirk all was
gravity and soberness. Leaving the kirk, how-
ever, two papers played the company—to the
appropriate tune of “ The Highland Wedding”—
up to M'Pherson’s house. The wedding had
taken place late in the afternoon ; and, on arriving
at M'Pherson’s, we all had tea —mostly cakes and
whisky. As soon as it was dark dancing com-
menced in the big kitchen. In an interval be-
tween the dances one of the pipers, Angus Canip-
bell, struck up “ The Campbells are coming.”
“ There she goes,” whispered Bruce, excitedly.
“ What goes ? ” I asked.
“ D’ye no hear what he’s playin’ ? ”
“Yes,” I replied, “‘The Campbells are
coming.’ What’s wrong about that ? ”
“Everything’s wrong. Why, the other piper
is an Ogilvy, and there is a feud between the ‘
Ogilvies and the Campbells, two or three hundred
years auld. Listen.”
I listened, and from the verandah came the
fierce, answering skirl of the Ogilvy’s pipe, “ The
Bonnie House o’ Airlie.’’
Faintly above the scream of the pipes I heard :
“ She’s a tam lee. There’s no a Cawmill efer was
born”—“She’ll haf seen Sandy Ogilvy’’—while
scraps of Gaelic were flung about in profusion. I
went carefully along the passage and peeped into
the kitchen, where I saw a Macrae climbing on
the shoulders of a MTntosh. At the same
moment a huge M‘Lennan grasped the Macrae
with both hands and hurled him through the
door. I drew back just in time, but a Maclure,
who was coming along the passage from the oppo-
site direction, was struck by the flying Macrae and
banged against thewall. He dropped, stunned, and
it took us ten minutes to revive him. A small glass
of whisky was poured down his throat, when he at
once arose and fiercely demanded the name of his
assailant. We wouldn’t tell him, and he wanted
to fight the lot of us.
By the time we had got him pacified the two
pipers had met. Flinging their pipes aside, they
sprang at each other with loud Gaelic and English
curses. The English curses predominated. A
man named M ‘Kenzie explained to me that “Ta
English will pe a fery goot langidge to curse in,
yes inteet.” I helped to separate the pipers.
Bruce then told me that the huge Highlander
who had dealt so unceremoniously with the
Macrae was related to MTntosh—his father’s first
wife’s cousin was married to MTntosh’s step-
sister—so that it was no wonder he had taken his
part. I began to feel glad that no one present
was related to me. It was nine o’clock when we
got things in order again ; but, just as a foursome
reel had been set going, I heard the noises of a
M‘Kenzie and a MTntosh raised in high argu-
ment.
As I turned to see what was the matter,
MTntosh looked into the face of M‘Kenzie and
imitated the whinny of a horse. Like a gun-flash
M‘Kenzie’s fist shot into MTntosh’s jaw, and the
MTntosh spread his length on the floor. In an
instant all was confusion. The M‘Kenzies and
their relations rushed at the MTntoshes and their
friends, and the fight became general. All the
while a torrent of abuse poured back and forth.
Dougal Bruce turned to me and remarked, with
a shake of the head : “I expectit this”; and,
as we climbed on a table out of the road he ex-
plained. “ There is a legend that, many years
ago, a ship with horses on board was wrecked on
that part of the coast of Scotland inhabited by the
M'Kenzies. The dead horses were washed ashore,
and, so the story goes, the M'Kenzies were so
poor and hungry that they lived on horse for
months after.” After a, pause, Bruce added, “I
expect it’s a dom lee ; but ye have only to whinny
at a M‘Kenzie and he’s at ye like a mountain cat.
The uproar was tremendous. Every now ana
then a well-executed whinny brought the
M'Kenzies on with a fresh rush. Our table got
upset : Bruce and I crawled through a window
into the garden. Gradually little knots of men
and women shot out of various doors and sped oil
home, and by ten o’clock the house was deserted.
I got an invitation yesterday to the wedding ot
Flora Maclean and Alister MTntosh ; but it the
fair Flora delays the ceremony until I put m an
appearance, I am afraid she’ll die an old maid.
One Highland wedding will do me for a long time.

HOW cross you are ! That’s because
you have been cooped in that horrid old
office all day. Lean your head on my
shoulder, and light a cigarette, and hush.
“This morning I took my lunch to Middle
Harbor. I passed egg-farms, bee-farms, and wild
flowers on the road. The blue sky was kissed by
baby clouds, and when 1 caught sight of the water,
a million diamonds sparkled on its breast.
“ ‘Lap, lap, lap,’ it murmured, as I flung my-
self on a warm rock on its brink to watch the
jelly and garfish that appeared from time to time
in the limpid water ; and it sang in my ears like a
lullaby as I listened to the whip bird’s whistle,
and the quick splash of fish leaping buoyantly on
the ripples.
“I tried to read, and succeeded, for a little
while. But what are books to one surrounded by
sky, and tree, and water? Besides, my walk had
made me hungry, and I had my sandwiches and
oranges to consume, winding up with a long
draught of lemon-sweetened water, which is as
good as champagne when drunk in the sunlight.
There were some cockleshell boats below my
rock, which made me long to go a-rowing. But
I can’t row ! And you were at your office work-
ing like a nigger to earn our bread and butter.
So I longed in vain, and wished I had brought
fishing-tackle to try my hand at the garfish.
You’d love garfish (as I cook them), especially the
home caught ‘ gar, ’ which is so different from that
caught with a silver hook. But wishing’s not
having, so ’twas merely mutton I set before you
this evening, poor weary bread-and-butter-getter !
“I felt so good in the sunshine, as if I grew
taller, and stronger, and browner every minute.
Indeed, I felt almost coo happy when I flung off
my hat and gloves, and basked in the sunlight,
though, of course, there was one thing missing.
‘Never the time and place,’ as Mr. Browning
hath it. But some Sunday we will prove that
statement a- fallacy, for we ll have the time and
place and everything, if it doesn’t rain (and the
sandwiches aren’t stale, or your hat doesn’t blow
into the water). Won’t it be heavenly, you and
I on a rock in old clothes, with lots of food and
fishing-tackle, and ‘Paolo and Francesca’ to
read in the intervals ?
“ See my sweet rose ? I found it by the boat-
sheds, and gathered it for you in memory of my
jaunt. It’s faded now, but its scent brings the
lapping water and waving trees and blue sky back
even yet. Such sky ! The faintest of faint dream
azures—the water being green, shading from
olive to blue, and from blue to amber gold. I
scrambled round the rocks before I left, and
startled some silent men fishftlg. Their dog flew
at me, but I wasn’t afraid, and he ceased to bark
when he saw it, and leapt all over me, licking my
hands with his warm red tongue. I wish we had
a dog just like him ; he was the cutest fox-terrier ;
but, alas ! there is the dog-tax to be considered.
‘‘Dear, I wish you could have seen the sunlight
trailing her bright fingers over the boat sides,
and stroking the waving grasses. I wish you
could have seen the white fairy sickle moon, and
heard the sky birds twitter. ... 1 wish
But you are asleep, at last, and the washing-up

KIDNEY TROUBLE IS SERIOUS.
It Comes on Unnoticed —but is Fatal if Neglected.
Have you suspected your kidneys as the cause of your trouble ?
Does your back, bead, or limbs ache ? Is there rheumatism, weak
heart, or dropsy ? Is there too great or too little flow of the urine, with
gravel or sediment ? Do you feel always tired, done up, nervous ?
These symptoms, and many more, come from unfiltered blood'—blood
loaded with impurities that are poisoning every organ.
If, then, you would “ get well/’ you must make the kidneys well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are for the kidneys and
bladder only. They are a special kidney medicine (no ac-
tion on the bowels). They are nature’s greatest healing
medicine, because they heal the kidneys, the blood purifiers,
and help them in their great work.
Bead the following testimony from a Sydney
woman :
MOTHER AND CHILD CURED
Of Eackache and Weak Kidneys.
Mrs. Louis Smorti, 1 Little Selwyn-street, Moore Park, this city, says “ I can
give Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a real good recommendation to all those who
suffer with weak kidneys. I have proved this medicine in the case of my little boy,
who had very weak kidneys. Every night he lay in discomfort in a wet bed, and
the secretions were very discolored. Indications showed that the kidneys were in a
very unhealthy condition. I heard of children having been cured of this complaint
by Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, but did not use them at first, I tried various other
remedies. After a good many failures, a friend again strongly urged me to try
Doan’s Pills. I resolved that I would give them a trial, and am very pleased to be
able to tell you that they have wrought a permanent cure. Two boxes were
quite sufficient in his case, and he has been quite well for over a year now.
“ I might also mention that Doan’s Pills proved very good in roy own case. I
suffered with backaches, headaches, and giddiness. Some days I could scarcely get
about my work. I used four boxes, and am quite cured—and cured permanently,
for over a year has passed and I have had no return of the ailment.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IWUZ groomin’ f’r Cobb and Co. on the
Momah-road, twenty miles from Toolpara,
when the loonattick came. The place was
a three-roomed slab cottage, with an iron galley
at the back, an’ the main road in front, an’ a big
sand ridge and Cobb and Co. ’s paddock away on
the right. It was a lonely, beastly place. One
night I’d gone ter bed—the missus an’ lin our
room, kids in another. The third room we kep’
f r meals an coach passengers. I dunno what
time twas, but it seemed ter me ’bout midnight,
when I yers moon-rendin’ shrieks a-comin' from
the big sand ridge. I jumps up an’ tells the
missus ter lie quiet, an’ I stan’s ther with the
prospration a-droppin’ orf me an’ me ’air stan’in’
fair on end, a-list’nin’. I wasn’t dressed much,
an’ the skeeters wuz bad.
The shrieks gits closer an’ closer, until ’tlast
they bumped fair inter th’side th’’ut. There
wuz a voice singin’out, “Keep orf! keep orf!”
and I thinks : “’Ere’s a pretty bloomin’ mess,”
an’ I jus’ opens the winder—’twuz on’y a wood
shutter ung on leather ’inges. I jus’ opens it
nuff ter see, an ther’ in the moonlight I spots a
man mother-nakid. An’ orl the time ’e keeps
on singin’ out “Keep orf.”
I sez ter the missus, “F’r Gor sake, you lie
quiet,” ’cos I didn’ know what the cove might be
up to. ’E’d a three-foot-six saplin’ in ’is ’and,
an I cud tell ’e’d bin drilled, ’cos, after givin’ one
extra yell, ’e ben’s ’is knees an’ sez “Guard !”
like the Grenadiers useter do in Wellin’ton
Barracks. Then ’e sez “ Point! ”, an’ nearly jobs
me in th’ eye through the chink in th’ shutter,
lhen’esez “Charge!” or somethin’ like that,
an’jabbelthe shutter fair in the middle an’shot
it right onter me nose.
I jus’ remembers seein’ the missus grab the shut-
ter as I fell back’ards over the bed. Me nose was
bleedm’tremenjus, an’the naked individual puts
his head in at the broken winder an’ orders me to
form meself into a holler square. The missus told
im to go home an’ get dressed, an’ he turns his
back on ’er an’ sez, “Prepare to receive cavalry.”
Me missus sez, “You speak to ’im, Willie.” So
I sez, “ Wot’sup, ole chap ?” ’E sez, “They’re
after me. To capchure me is everyone’s desire.”
“Oh, go on,” I sez. “You’re tight, you are.
That’s a song ” ; an’ I put me bleed in’ nose out of
the winder, an’ tried to smile friendly-like.
’E soz, “Two men with guns is after me, an’ I
know they’re married men, ’cos I yerd the babv
cry.”
“Missus,” I sez, in a noarse whisper, “you go
an’ git me the long-’andled shovel, an’ the axe, an’
the tommy hawk, and tell young Willie ’’—that’s
my nipper—“ter go down an’ catch ole Barris-
ter.” Then I goes on tryin’ ter soothe ’im down.
“’Oo wants yer, ole chap? Teamsters?” I
know’d ther was’n no teamsters within 30 miles.
“ No,” ’e sez ; “ two strangers.”
“Wot d’ they want yer for?”
“F’r murd’rin’ me wife. An’ it ain’t true,
neither. Ther wuz a Court of Enquiry an’ I wuz
’quitted—honorably ’Quitted.” Then he waved the
saplin’ an’ told the army to mobilise.
Jus’ then the wife comes back an’ shoves a
millet broom inter me ’and. Now I arst yer wot
sort of a weppin’ is a millet broom agin’ a stark
starin’ loonattick, mother-nakid, ’oo’s murdered ’is
wife an’ smashed your nose ?
“Yes,” I sez, “wot’sthis?” in another ’oarse
whisper.
“ Broom,” she sorter ’isses.
“ I can see that,” I sez, “ but it ain’t no good ter
me.”
“ Well, the long ’andled shovel’s in th’ galley,
an’ th’ axe an’ tommy’awk’s at the wood ’eap, an’
Willie won’t go for ’em, any more’n ’e’ll go f’r
Barrister.
“I’ll talk ter young Willie when I got rid er
this other loonattick,” I sez, severe-like. Yer see
I wuz sorter ’oldin’ the fort, an’ couldn’t afford ter
waste no words.
“My fren,” sez the loony, “ could j’er come out
an’ give me a ’and agin’ these yer murderers ?”
“You come ter-morrer, ’bout midday,” I sez,
“I’m sorter tied to th’ ’ouse ter-niglit.”
Can yer tell me where there is any men wot’d
give an’ unfort’nit bloke a ’and ? ”
“ Yes,” I sez. “ you foller the river down to the
third bend, an’ you’ll find a ’undred men camped
there. They’ll ’elp you. Sorry I can’t ter-night.”
“Oh, Willie,” sez the missis over my shoulder,
“ wot an awful ”
“ Dry up,” I sez, “ I want ter git rid of ’im. ’’
“ Yes, but why couldn’t you tell him five miles
down the river ? ’E’ll be back now before ’e’s
started.”
I’d bin a bit ’f a fool, come ter think ’f it. It
ain’t no good tellin’ a lie onless you tell a good
one. Anyway, ’e thanks me very ’arty f’r th’
information, an’ I ’pologises for not arskin’ ’im
inter th’ ’ouse. Before you arsks a bloke inter th’
ouse ’e should ’ave at least a sock on ’im.
. I listens t’ ’im paddin’ away with ’is bare feet
in th sand, until I reckons ’e’s a safe distance, an’
then I makes a bee-line f’r th’ long ’andled shovel
an’ th’ axe an’ the tommy’awlc, and I tries ter fix
up me ’ole gun wot Fred Mullins guv me, but
couldn’ make no fist of it, because young Willie’d
unscrewed the ’ammers f’r sinkers an’ wuz too
frightened ter think wot ’e’d done with ’em.
Also, I sends the nipper down f’r Barrister, an"’
me an’ the missus wuz jus’ settlin’ down torkin’
it over when we yers ’im pad-paddin’ like a
kangaroo up to the ’ouse agin.
I waved the axe in the air an’ sez to ther wife,
You git inter bed an’ cover yerself over
comf’table, an’ say yer prayers.”
“ Wot for ? D’ye think ’e’ll murder ns ? ”
“ Most like. But ’e’ll ’ave ter murder me fust,
an while I’m puttin’ up a bit ’f a scrap with ’im
you d best take the kiddies down the paddick.
Which’d I better take ’im with, th’ axe er th’
shovel ?”
.“ Shovel, Willie. You can keep ’im further orf
with that, an’ you never were any good with th’
axe.”
That wuz’n’ true, but I put it down to the fright
the missus wuz in, an’ did’n’ say nothink.
I gits to the winder agin, but ’e seemed quite
armless.
bay, mate,” ’e sez, “you’d no need ter go back
on a man the way yer did. Thet weren’t no
undred men camped in the bend.”
“You didn’t go fur enough,” I sez. “ Ther’s
more than a ’undred if you goes fur enough.”
.. won’t look for ’em t’night,” ’e sez.
Which is th road ter Toolpara ? ”
Git through that [fence, an’ ’s soon as yer hit
the road, turn ter ver right an’ keen straight on.”
Thanks,” ’e sez, an’ orf ’e goes, an’ when ’e
gits ’bout ’arf a mile erway I sees ’im wavin’ ’is sap-
lin’ again an’ thrown’ up fortifications. I never
saw such a military cove with nothin’ on before.
I spends the rest of the night with me weppins
in me hand. In the mornin’l packed the wife an’
all the kiddies orf up the river to the station in
the sulky, an’ I jumps on ole Barrister an’ ’its ’im
ard with the shovel, an’ gallops orf inter Toolpara
fer the police.
I called at Fred Spinks’ an’ ’e ’ad’n seen my
fren’, but ’e’d a ’erd ’im. He ’ad passed Fred’s
about four in the mornin’ under the impression
’e was a cannon.
‘‘What yer got the shovel for?” ’e sez.
“Case I meet ’im,” an’ orf I goes agin after
Fred gives me a good stiff nip.
I gits into Toolpara an’ tells my yarn to
Moriarity, the trap, an’ ’e takes me up to the
Sargint, an’ I tells ’im. I’d ’ad a few words with
Moriarity some time before over a horse. The
Sargint sez, “ What shtate wuz this mahn in when
you ’ristid him, Conshtable Moriarity?”
“As you see him now, Sargint. No hat an’ no
boots, but ounly ’is fate, a long-handled shovel in
’is hahnd, an’ ridin’ a bay harse in a lather o’
shweat. There was blood on ’is hose, an’ ’e
shmelt o’ grog loike a pooblic house bar, an’ he
was aslikin’ afther a naked loonattiek.”
With that the Sargint locked me up. And I
was brought up at 10 o’clock charged with drunk
and disorderly and resisting the police, an’
wavin’ shovels an’ other implements. When the
charge was read the Sargint sez that perhaps
there was something in what I’d told them, as
they had to send out to the eight-mile gate and
bring in a man who had wandered naked into a
travellers’ camp the night before. My case wuz
’eld over, an’ my frien’ of the night before brung
in. The travellers ’ad rigged ’im out, an’ took
away ’is waddy, an’ ’e didn’t look nothink like so
f’roshus as ’e done in the moonlight. ’E wuz
sensible, too, an’ backed up what I’d tole ’em.
Then ’e suddenly broke out an’ presented arms,
an’ undressed ’imself so promp’ that before the
trap got’im down ’e ’ad nothin’ on but one boot
an’ a loud shriek.
Course I wuz d’scharged; but when I wanted ter
go f’r the p’lice, the P.M. sez : “If you come ter
think on it, I’m sure you’ll allow that the p'lice
’ad every excuse f’r arrestin’ you. You were found
the fust thing in the mornin’, bareheaded, bare-
footed, without a coat, galloping a horse bare-

NE'ER-DO-WEEL.
How the Beer Fights.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE publican and I were holding a
meeting in the bar. We were the Sports
Committee, and were trying to fix up an
aquatic programme for “pay Saturday.” There
was a ladies’ race (double sculls) the prize for
which event was a pair of satin shoes donated by
the president. It was rather an awkward prize to
be divided, and we were debating the advisability
of giving a second, and wondering where it was to
come from. He suggested the member for the dis-
trict, and I instructed him to write to that gentle-
man. Several dead-beats, in various stages of
intoxication, sat about the bar on casks, talking
fight and Billy McCall, at whom any one of them
would like to have a cut. It was Eight Hours
Day, but the beats hadn’t the needful to celebrate
the occasion in a fitting manner. They had been
drinking since the previous Friday night. Bung
called one noisy individual to order a couple of
times for interrupting the meeting, and then he
went round and jobbed him. His mates said it
was good enough for him ; the meeting had their
entire sympathy.
After a bit, a couple of men, looking as if they
had wandered away from a Sunday-school picnic,
dropped in, and the meeting was adjourned sine
die. One of the newcomers shouted for all hands,
and was regarded as a perfect Godsend in conse-
quence. He took a “long ’un” himself, and,
after a lapse of a few minutes, started to inform
the crowd, which was friendly, that he could fight
a bit. Somebody remarked that he looked a likely
man ; and another said, in an audible tone, that
he would be an ugly snag to bump. He shouted
again, and had another “long ’un.” Then he
intimated that he had once challenged Billy
McCall, who shied off him, and that he was just
dying to meet Murphy, or any other man for a
matter of that. “Billy” had had ’em on with
him a time or two, and knew when to keep off the
grass. r -•
Just here a one-armed man, who had been out
and had missed two drinks, stepped in and wanted
to know where the alleged fighting man buried
his dead. He was promptly called to order for
interrupting the gentleman, who shouted once
more. Then the man who had shouted three
times wanted to have a cut at anything in
the bar, or anything they could fetch into it.
His mate saw matters were getting serious, and
tried to drag him away; but he wouldn’t be
dragged.
He had a fellow cornered, and was demonstrat-
ing to him how he had knocked a well-known pug
out in the ninth round. The mate here got over
to Bung, and informed that gentleman that he
could not make things out. The manslayer, he
said, had never had what you could call a fight in
his life, and was not in the habit of talking fight.
Bung said, “Let him alone; he’ll be all right
after a bit. It’s only the beer talking, and it’s a
fighting brew.” The friend assured the publican
that he was “a real decent, quiet man, and
attended church regular.” Bung hadn’t a doubt
about it.
After a bit, the bruiser called for liquor for
himself and the man in the corner. The crowd,
finding itself left out, rose in a body and wanted
him to put ’em up. He’d been skiting fight a lot,
and it was anxious to see what sort he was at the
game. He was peeling off his coat for a lash at
the poundlceeper, when the butcher’s dog rubbed
against him, and he collapsed on the floor.
Then the crowd sat itself on the casks dis-
gusted. The publican had the wreck carried out
on the grass, where it started slaughtering Billy
McCall at intervals, and being very unwell
between times.
A week later I met the man, fishing, with his
wife. He was sober, and borrowed some of my
prawns. I ventured to ask after McCall. “Never
met the man in my life,” he said, “and take not
a bit of interest in fighting or fighters.”
YARRUM.


This is the strong and convincing testimonial of a
lady residing at Dalmain, N. S. W., whose portrait
is also given.
“Some time ago I was taken
very ill, losing my appetite,
could not sleep, and was unable
to do my work. I was attended
by two doctors, but to no effect.
I became very thin and weak.
Sometimes when I was out I
would become so ill I would have
to go into a neighbor’s house'
until I was fit to walk a gain. I
cannot describe my sufferings,
only to say that this state of
things lasted for months.
“At last I remembered your advertisements in the
papers, so determined to try a bottle of Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. Finding the first so beneficial, I took another, and
still another, and the three bottles completely put me
to rights.
“I am now perfectly healthy and strong, and can eat
and sleep, and work like a Trojan.”
All are not alike. There are many
put up in imitation of Ayer’s. Avoid them. Be sure
that you get
Sarsaparilla
and then you will not suffer disappointment.
