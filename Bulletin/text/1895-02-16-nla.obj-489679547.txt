THE “KEEPER- PILE PILL
... (Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER "
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curativ.e Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, In confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic oases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF Iff ALL OASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2, 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do .not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER '*
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are Jaded by over-
work, it you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size

The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors.

A story of two “colonials.” Hicary was a
typiqal_ bash-Australian—a stockman and a good
horseman. He was riding this day towards
Drayton. He recognised the man who cantered
up behind him as Tyson, and said, “ Good-day.”
“Good-day,” was the reply. They rode along
together awhile. Tyson was talkative and in the
humor to joke. “What countryman are you?”
he asked. “A German,” untruthfully answered
the “Cornstalk.” “A German! Well, you’ve
the best seat I’ve ever seen on a horse for a Ger-
man.” “And what countryman are you?"
followed Hicary. “A native.” “A nativel

OLD LOVES.
Louise, have you forgotten yet
The corner of the flowery land,
The ancient garden where we met,
My hand that trembled in your hand?
Our lips foui d words scarce sweet enough,
As low beneath the willow trees
e sat; have you forgotten, love?
Do you remember, love, Louise 7
arie, have you forgotten yet
The loving barter that we made?
The rings we changed, the suns that set,
The woods fulfilled with sun and shade?
The fountains that were musical
By many an ancient trysting-tree—
Marie, have you forgotten all?
Do you remember, love, Marie?
Christine, do you remember yet
Your room with scents and roses gay?
My garret—near the sky ’tw.as set—
The April hours, the nights of May ?
The clear, calm nights—the stars above
That whispered they were fairest seen
Through no cloud-veil? Remember, kve 1
Do you remember, love, Christine?
Louise is dead, and, well-a-day 1
Malic a sadder path has ta'en ;
And pale Christine has passed away
In southern suns to bloom again.
Alas ! for one and all of us—
Marie, Louise, Christine, forget i
Our bower of love is ruinous,
And I alone remember yet.

down and seriously consider the fact that he con-
sists mostly of five buckets of water.
A Maoriland M.L.A. recently turned up
to address his constituents in an awful state of
liquor, and after looking at the audience with a
beery eye for some few minutes he lurched heavily
forward and fell off the platform on top of his

and the proceedings closed with an M.H R. grop-
ing around on all-fours and stating feebly to the
table that he was in favor of “Prohib-hic-

racehorses. In the same town resides the Rev.
Zedediah Catchmore, a clergyman whose efforts
in favor of prohibition have found much grace and
acceptance. The Rev. Zedediah wanted to let a
house of his, and placed it in the hands of an
agent. The ungodly Jones proposed ,to take it,
and was shown over the place by his reverence,
to whom he mentioned that he thought of putting
up some loose boxes oti the premises for his horses.
All seemed to go smoothly, and it only remained
for the rent to be named and the terms of tenancy
agreed’ upon; but very'shortly Jones received a
note, transcribed below verbatim
Jones, Esq. 28,12/’94.
Dear Sir,—l regret to say that in thinking over the
question of letting to you I fed that your connection with
the turf makes it impossible to me. lam satisfied that
the speculations of the racecourse are in violation of our
Lord’s golden rule, “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself,” and I must not, therefore, profit from such a
source. Regretting that I cannot oblige you as I would
so gladly do were no point of conscience involved,
I am yours faithfully,
Zedediah OatchmorK
Then Jones went to see the house-agent, in con-
versation with whom he said : “You know,
Smith, my wife was rather keen on the house, and
she was intending to use some of her own money
in paying part of the rent, if it was too stiff for
me.” The result of this conversation was dis-
closed next day when Jones received from Pastor
Catchmore the following indication of the docility
of a well-trained “ still small voice.” The would-
be landlord had by this time become acquainted
with Jones’s initials, and the cold “yours faith-
fully ” now blooms into “yours with regards ” :
Dear Sir,—Mr. Smith has explained to me that I shall
be virtually letting to Mrs. Jones. This satisfies my
: cruples, and if we can come to terms I shall be happy to
let to you either by the week or by lease, the latter being
perhaps the preferable method for both of us ; and I trust
you will find the house a very enjoyable home for your-
self and family. I am sending Mr. Smith my terms this
morning.
Yours with regards,
ZEDEDIAR CATCHMORR.
The terms were too stiff even for so holy a house,
and Jones is still pondering over the “ satisfaction
of the scruples.’’

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1895.
The Deaf Adder of Politics.
The Turner Government has undertaken to
devote part of the recess to considering its
position with regard to the Victorian Legis-
lative Council, and it is almost an open secret
that it intends to include the Referendum in
the pi’ogramme for next session as a remedy
for the present state of chronic deadlock.
As a peaceful, law-abiding Government this
is probably about as good a course as it could
be expected to take. A constitutional
Ministry ruling over a very small province is
not in a position to make a coup-iVetat unless
it has the whole population in a state of red-
hot enthusiasm at its back. Moreover, a
Ministry which consists very largely of
lawyers reared in the solemn atmosphere and
traditions of parchment and horse-hair and
6s. Bd., is not the material with which coups
d'etat are made.- Therefore George Turner
and his brilliant henchman, Isaac A. Isaacs,
are probably doing as good a thing as the
Constitution and the Premier’s peculiarly
legal cast of mind will allow under very hard
circumstances.
* # *
Unfortunately, the proposal to establish
the Referendum as a cure for the perennial
deadlock in Victorian politics is just as
adequate to the case as would be a pint of
water to extinguish Gehenna, and it is likely
to be fully an effective as a reproachful look
directed at a herd ol stampeded cattle. The
Bulletin says this with a perfect recollec-
tion of the fact that the Referendum is an
important part of its own political pro-
gramme, and a device which it has long and
consistently advocated. It believes as cor-
dially as ever that the proposed measure will
suit certain purposes better than anything
else that can be devised. As a guide-post by
which tjie nation can show its representatives
the way it wants them to go it has no equal;
but what is wanted in the present case is a
weapon by which the House of 48 Rich
Landlords can be scared out of its strongly
entrenched position, and a guide-post, re-
garded as an implement of offence, is of
little account.
« • •
Setting aside the fact that the Referendum
is avowedly intended as a weapon against
the Council, that it can’t be established with-
out the Council’s consent, and that the spec-
tacle of the Council consenting, unless under
extreme pressure—of which there is no sign
at present—is too picturesque for belief,
there remains the other fact that something
quite different is needed to meet the case.
The reason for the Referendum is that,
among the multitudinous issues brought
forward at a general election, it is impossible
for the people to express in any definite—
or even in any moderately indefinite
fashion their views on every important ques-
tion. Therefore, this law gives them a con-
venient means of instructing the men who re-
present them what to do or what not to do on
any given great issue. But, unfortunately,
it doesn't furnish them with any means of
instructing the men who don't represent
them. The popular veto is a handy device
by which the people can prevent Parliament
doing things of which they disapprove, but,
as the Victorian Legislative Council never
does anything, this hardly applies. That
body is a perpetual veto in itself. Also, the
power of initiative, by which the people car.
direct their representatives to proceed with
any proposed measure, only applies in cases
where the same body which gave the direc-
tion can discharge those legislators who fail
to comply with the popular will. The Vic
torian Council, however, can’t he discharged.
The people who would form the popular
majority in favor of a progressive measure,
and the people to whom the Council is even
nominally responsible, are two entirely
different constituencies The obstructive
body can’t be dissolved. It is duly aut horised
to go on its placid way, despite all the
Referendum on this earth, and even when it
expires the property qualification of its mem-
bers prevents the election of any but sub-
stantial Tories ; therefore, the electors must
needs send back a new crowd which would
bo just as proof against popular votes as the
old one.
# « »
Moreover, the Referendum can only affirm
principles; the details must be left, in a
great measure, to the Legislature. Where
the Legislature is elected by the people,
and is answerable to the people, it may
generally be assumed that it will endeavour
to execute the popular mandate according
to the spirit in which it is given. Where it
isn’t elected by the people, and is so pro-
tected by its property qualification that it is
scarcely answerable to anybody, and where
it is distinctly hostile to the public sent!
ment, then, if it executes the mandate at all,
it will do it entirely in its own way. In
other words, when the people have affirmed
some progressive principle, and the Assembly
has put it into form, the Council, even if it
doesn’t wholly reject it, will “amend” it
out of all semblance of the original intention.
In England, some years ago, the people
affirmed as definitely as circumstances
would admit—the principle that an employer
should he liable for injuries received by a
workman through defective machinery or
other circumstances for which the employer
was distinctly liable. The Commons passed
the measure with enthusiasm. The Lords also
passed it with enthusiasm, but with a proviso
that a workman might relieve his employer
of his liability by agreement. As the average
employer would not engage any workman
who did not relieve him of his liability by
agreement this practically nullified the prin-
ciple involved. Even if the Victorian
Council should enact the Referendum in the
first place, and should not absolutely cast
the expression of the popular will into the
waste-paper basket in the second, it would
probably carry out the national mandate in
a very similar fashion.
# * *
The Victorian Constitution is practically a
contrivance for bringing about incurable
deadlocks, and its existence is a standing
evidence of the incapacity of the British
Parliament as a constitution-maker. In
other countries various devices exist for
arriving at some definite result in cases of
disagreement. Sometimes one House is re-
cognised as the preponderating influence,
and when it has passed a hill a certain
number of times, or by a certain fixed
majority, it becomes law despite the veto of
the other Chamber. A still better and
more effective proviso, and one which
exists in many democratic countries, enacts
that in cases of disagreement the two
Chambers meet as one body, and the vote of
the majority carries the day. In Great
Britain, Queensland, Maoriland, and New
South Wales, a certain clumsy and circuitous
remedy is provided whereby the Ministry
may, after a bitter conflict with the Sovereign
or her representative, appoint a hatch of
nominees of its own way of thinking to turn
its minority into a majority. Victoria, how-
ever, has absolutely no remedy at all. By a
wonderful effort of perverted ingenuity the
Imperial Parliament supplied it with one
House which must, in the nature of things,
become more and more Democratic, and
another which must necessarily remain
bitterly Tory. Then it gave one unlimited
power of action and the other unlimited
power of obstruction, and bade them fight
the matter out to the bitter end after care-
fully providing that neither combatant could
get at the other. It is another version of
the old problem, how to add together a
mile-and-a-half and eighteen-pence, and give
the answer in cwts.
* * «
When the Victorian people elected the
present Assembly almost every candidate
was called upon to declare in favor of the
Land-tax principle, and the popular decision
on that point was as definite as a cumber-
some system would admit. Yet the nation,
by that declaration, only shook an impotent
fist at the Council, and that body took no
manner of notice. If the nation reaffirmed
the same principle by a Referendum vote it
would merely shake the same impotent fist
a little more definitely but with no more
assurance • f any good result. The llefereti
lum, in such a case, is only a means whereby
'fie people may speak a little more clearly to
iho political deaf adder which refuses to
listen, (’lie only way out of the eternal
deadlock lies in a reform of the present
hopeless Constitution, and there are only
two methods by which that reform can he.
arrived at. One is by inducing the Imperial
Parliament, which made the present, system,
to unmake it. Berry tried this device and
failed, hut, the British Cabinet of to-day is
very unlike that of Berry’s time, and the
experiment might be renewed with more
success. On the other hand, George
Turner is very unlike Berry, in the days
when that politician was still the Tribune of
Hie People, and he looks altogether unlike
the man to attempt so dangerous and unusual
an expedient. The other possibility lies in
forcing the Council to reform itself by some-
thing that—to produce such a result—must
needs look very like popular insurrection.
Either way it is necessary to decide in
advance exactly what measure of reform is
required, and it is necessary to gain as much
as possible while seeming to ask for as little as
circumstances will allow,
* • *
It may be safely assumed, to begin with,
that even an allegedly Liberal British Parlia-
ment would not enact the total abolition of
the Council, and that that body could not be
induced to totally abolish itself without an
actual—not merely au apparent—revolution.
Moreover, there is no necessity that the
Council should be abolished at present ; all
that is wanted is that it should be made
directly responsible to the people, and the
abolition would follow when required. The
desired result might be arrived at by enact-
ing that, in the case of a deadlock, the two
Houses should sic and vote as one body ;
this device is far from perfect, but it is pro-
bably the best one immediately available,
and it would, in most cases of really serious
importance, enable the popular chamber to
have its way. Another method would be to
abolish the property qualification for
M’s.L.C., to remunerate them at the same
rate as members of the Lower House, and
to make both Chambers dissoluble simul-
taneously. The Toryism of the Upper
House arises not so much because its 160,000
constituents are Conservative by instinct,
as because the property qualification
makes it impossible for any save mem-
bers of the most hopelessly Tory class
in the community to become eligible for mem-
bership, therefore the proposed change would
gradually democratise the hitherto fossilised
gathering. Either way, it is almost certain
that the Upper House would be brought so
far under popular control, as to enable the
people to reform it further without resorting
to any extraordinary methods. Also, either
way, the nation only asks as much as is
urgently necessary, and yet, while preserving
strict moderation, asks as much as is imme-
diately required. The Referendum, though
a good'and thoroughly Democratic measure,
is insufficient for the occasion. There is
nothing to be gained by enabling the people
to accurately express their policy to a Cham-
ber which isn’t responsible to the people,
and which is not required to care for any
policy save its own.

A Sydney paper puts the case for the private
publican and against the State Drink Monopoly
as follows :
The main argument used was that under State manage-
ment there would be less drunkenness, because of the
better quality of liquor sold, and the cleanlier conditions
under which the business would be carried on. This,
however, is merely a matter of opinion. It is no more use
blaming the fusel oil or the turpentine than blaming
“the salmon,” for when all is said and done, no matter
what may be taken along with it, the main cause of
drunkenness is alcohol. It is not because the drink is
adulterated that it intoxicates, but because of the exces-
sive amount consumed. Men who drink bad spirit to
excess would be just as likely to over indulge in good
spirit, if it was available, so that, as far as temperance is
concerned, that argument does not count for much. But
if it did, there is no guarantee that we should get better
liquor in a State-conducted hotel than in a State-licensed
one. If drink is adulterated now it is done so in defiance
of the law, and there would be just the same chance of
making profit in this way by the State barman as by the
licensed publican. It is said that in Sweden the Gothen-
burg system works satisfactorily, but Sweden is a long
way off, and, besides, what might suit the Scandinavian
might not suit the Australian. As a general rule, the less
the Slate has to do in the way of buying and selling
amongst the people the better it comes off.
This statement is worth replying to, principally
because it puts the whole case for the private
fusel-oil industry into the smallest possible
compass. It isn’t much of a case, anyhow, but
it is about all there is. So far as concerns the
first part of it, alcohol is the main cause of
drunkenness ; but bad alcohol, according to any
number of seemingly reliable authorities, causes
a more violent form of drunkenness than does
the pure article. Even the journalistic drink-
apologist admits that alcohol is only the main
cause, not the sole cause; therefore, the other
cause being removed, there would, by its own
admission, be less drunkenness—how much less
is a matter of opinion. But, in addition to this,
there would be less drunkenness because there
would be far fewer drinking-shops, and because
there would be no temptation to sell drink to
people who were already intoxicated, as the
bar-keeper wouldn't trade for his own profit.
As for the statement, “there is no guarantee
that we should get better liquor in a .State-
conducted hotel than in a State-licensed one,”
it is mere drivel, and tolerably abject drivel at
that. The private hotel-keeper, when he sells
fiendish German brandy worth Is. a gallon, or
raw potato spirit illicitly manufactured in the
bush, at the price of good liquor, gets the profit
Jur himself, therefore he sells it. The civil ser-
vant who ran the State-owned pub. wouldn’t get
the profit for himself, therefore he wouldn’t sell
it. Or, to be more strictly accurate, he could only
get the profit for himself with the comparative
certainty of, sooner or later, forfeiting his Civil
Service billet, his salary and his prospective
pension, and getting several years in gaol for
embezzlement. Therefore, very few of him
would do it, and it could never become a con-
tinuous or widely-extended practice. As for
the statement that “ the less the State has to
do in the way of buying and selling, the better
it comes off,” that is only an irresponsible hat-
man opinion, backed by no kind of evidence,
and may, therefore, be passed by. If the State
is less honest than the private monopolist it
way be true ; if the State is more honest it cer-
tainly isn’t true ; if the two are only equally
honest again it isn’t true. By itself, and
unsupported by any semblance of proof,
it is just as convincing as an anonymous
denunciation on a post-card. Even a journal
with four times the circulation of any other
daily in Australia (and almost all Australian
dailies have four times the circulation of any
other daily) only speaks with the voice of one
man, and when it fails to quote a single in-
stance in support of its assertions then it is
just as reliable as the bald statement of any
other man, and no more so.
The Great Australian Wine Industry.
Mr. A. Despeissis, Consulting Viticulturist to
the N.S W. 1 >epa,rtment of Agriculture, ridicules
the idea that, the chief defects of Australian
wine are due to the “ youth ” of the beverage,
and its want of maturity He scouts the verity
of the very frequent remark—“ The wine is all
right; all it wants is age.” He tells Australian
vignerons bluntly that they don’t know their
business, from the choosing of the varieties of
grape to the fermenting and “ rearing ” of the
wine. He admits that age accentuates the
defects, so that the trend of his argument
would seem to be, not only that most Australian
wine is not all right except for age, but that,
though it may not be bad now, it will grow bad
with age ; and, if bad now, it will get worse
with age. “In N.S.W. wine-cellars are thou-
sands of gallons of very promising young wines
from last year’s vintage. In two years’ time
they will be found utterly tainted and ruined
through no fault of their own.” Mr Des-
peissis calls for a comprehensive Vine and
Fruit Pest Act, the establishment of a College
of Viticulture, possessing a vineyard, a well
organised cellar, and an oeuological labora-
tory, where analyses would be math ; also,
a strictly enforced Food Adulteration Act
and a revised Distillation Act. With tome
very keen observations on the iniquities of the
present New South Wales Distillation Act, the
premium it offers to “ mock brandy and patent
whisky,” and the evils of lunacy that follow in
their train, Mr. Bespeissis pictured the possi-
bilities of a market for a good, wholesome,
home-made brandy. The gist of his sermon
was that Victoria and South Australia succied
belter than New South Wales, because in tie
two first-named provinces nearly every district
has a central winery that turns the produce of
Ihe vineyards into wine according to approved
and scientific methods, whereas in New South
Wales each small grape-grower is his own wine-
maker, and is a wine-maker according to his
own loose and imperfect notions, and has no
properly-equipped cellars. The way out for
New Soutli Wales vignerons is, by organisation
and co.-operation, to establish central wineries
and a central wine association.
White v. Yellow.
“ The white man with the yellow money versus
the yellow man with the white money,” formed
the text of the most eloquent part of Morton
Frewen’s lecture on the “ Prevailing Industrial
Depression” in Melbourne last week. This
apostle of silver has been celebrated in Stead’s
paltering novel, “Our Splendid Paupers.”
Morton Frewen is a travelled man, and a man
of wide sympathies, and he probably realised
the humor of his surroundings at Melbourne
Athenaeum. The official bimetallists of Victoria
consist, for the most part, of the “ Young Tory
Patriotic League” and the “Tariff Reform
League,” and the several other disguises in
which the bank-clerks, and shipping-clerks,
and wool-clerks down South delight to disguise
themselves. Morton Frewen, who believes
himself to be fighting in the democratic cause,
had Softgoods Sargood for chairman, and
Budget Downes Carter to second the vote of
thanks, and brewer Fitzgerald, M.L.C., to
vocally support Sargood. When the lecturer
referred to “the pretty platitudes of the
Cobdbn Club, ’ it was probably for the pleasure
of seeing a row of Tories squirm in public,
which they did. Morton Frewen unfolded a
gospel of bimetallism abundantly more coherent
and reasonable than the Victorian Bimetallic
League ever reckoned upon. He gave his ad-
herence to the charge that the demonetisation
of silver was a deliberate crime, com-
mitted in the cause of usury, and that
England was an accomplice after the
fact. He is logical enough to admit chat
if the bi-metallic tie was effectively main-
tained by France singlehanded, then the practi-
cal adherence of any “first-class nation” to
bi-metallism would be sufficient to restore
silver. These are aspects of the question not
heard locally befoie. But “ Rawton Silver-
tongue,” as Stead calls him, proves too much
when he proves that Australian railways lau-


guish by reason of the fall in rupee exchange.
Australian railways, as administered by
Sfeioht, and Australian railways, as adminis-
tered by Eddy, come not in the same category.
Bi-metallists prove too much when they prove
against mono-metallism all the evils that Aus-
tralia lias suffered by reason of boom-madness
and boom-robbery. And it may be doubted
whether the racial issue involved in the “ white
man with the yellow money vermis the yellow
man with the white money ” will ever be settled
on the exchanges. The yellow man in Australia
is not tamed by mono-metallism. Whether he
is paid in terms of gold or of silver he can and
does underbid white labor. In Australia, with
many legislative restrictions, the yellow man is
a perpetual menace—and it is therefore only
natural that the advent of Asia as a competitor
in the world’s markets should materially incom-
mode. “ civilised ” industry. It is hard to see
how a fixed ratio between gold and silver would
seriously affect this racial issue. In the Dis-
pensation of Supply and Demand, the yellow-
man, who has about as few wants as a pig,
must have the advantage of cheapness. The
white-man must go. But, in communities
where the principle of Protection is upheld, the
white-man does not go—the yellow-man has to
stay away. At present Australia is suffering
from a complication of diseases, everyone of
which can be proved :
(1) Government by Contradiction and undemocratic
modes of electing legislators.
(2) Maladministration of railways and public works.
(3) Unscientific taxation, the interest on borrowings
spent on the land not being obtained therefrom, hut from
people who never benefited by the borrowings.
(4) Bank fiascoes, the nightmares of finance, caused
partly by noodledom and partly by knavery.
(5) Delayed Federation.
Morton Frewen, with marvellous statistical
lucidity, invites Australia to put a finger in
the bimetallic pie, but the pie into which Aus-
tralian affairs have been knocked claims first
attention, and probably when she has set her-
self up again Australia will choose to meddle
not at all with outside affairs.
Combination v. Competition.
During the trial in connection with the recent
tobacco robberies in Melb. the following evi-
dence concerning an importers’ ring was given :
Edward Stevens, manager for Henry Berry, examined
by Detective-Sergeant Sainsbury, said the m ichanls were
bound not to sell Victory, Golden Eagle, or Williams’s
aromatic tobacco under Is. lid. per lb. in caddies of 201 b.
each, and the duty was 3s. per lb. The price was, there-
fore, practically ss. per lb. wholesale.
Mr. Coldiia.m : This seems to he the outcome of a
“ring,” isn’t it ?
Witness: The whole case is the outcome of a “ ring.”
(Laughter).
Wasn’t there a “ring” to keep up the price of tobacco?
—All merchants obtain the tobacco at the same price from
Couchb, Calder and Co., the sole importers. There was
an agreement that all should sell at the same price. We
are under a £5O penalty not to sell at less.
Have you heard of people se.ling under cost price?—
Yes, but not these tobaccos.
Isn’t there really a “trades-union trust” or ring to
keep up the price?—No, it is simply to ensure a profit to
a!l concerned.
Nemesis ordained that this further evidence ot
importers’ tricks should be elicited by the
barrister who contested St. Kilda in the Free-
trade interest last elections. Needless to say,
the Tory press did not break out next morning
in leaded invectives against the “ ring ’ and its
resistance to the eternal laws of supply and
demand. Experience, indeed, has shown that
such combinations in the present state of affairs
can not only be formulated, but can be main-
tained successfully—and, perhaps, this is why
the Tory press did not attack the Tory im-
porters in the matter. Day by day the pre-
cepts and practices of the Tories grow
wider apart. The precepts get duller and
the practices become sharper. Tory bankers and
Tory importers set up politicians and editors to
proclaim doctrines which it is the daily task of
the said bankers and importers to disprove.
The price of everything such men deal in, from
bank-interest to bicycles, is fixed by combina-
tion and maintained by a “ ring and the day
is past for them, as well as for Democracy,
when the vague sophistries of the Manchester
School have serious attention in daily life. In
fact, the bogey “ laws ” of the Tory party are
only trotted out when there is agitation for
combination on behalf of the general com-
munity. It is then that the eternal
verities of political bosh find loudest ex-
position, and for the fortieth time the
Tory rally is promised. In the meantime, the
importing rings go on prosperously “ ensuring
a profit to all concerned.” And there is no
reason why a fair profit should not be ensured
to all concerned—the trouble is that secret
combinations generally aim at an unfair profit—
and the public is robbed right and left. It
might do some good to compel registration,
under a heavy penalty for non-compliance,
of the charters of all “trusts,” “combina-
tions,” and “ rings.” The public need not fear
the open foe—it is the secret foe that cannot
he guarded against.
A Land-Grab Case.
An appeal case, which is now dragging its pro-
tracted length along before the Frivy Council
at enormous cost to the N. S. Wales Treasury,
is remarkable as one of the finest examples on
record of the gall of the private landowner. A
good many years ago the local “Crown”
granted to somebody or other—The Bulletin
either forgets or never knew the name of the
grantee—a large area of land at Cremorae, on
Sydney harbour. In the deed the said Crown
expressly reserved to itself a strip along the
shore 100 feet wide, measuring from high-water
mark. The grantee’s land started from the
further side of this strip, and, according to the
explicit terms of the deed, he had no more claim
to the portion reserved than he had to Bucking-
ham Palace, or the delta of the Nile. Never-
theless, when, in 1888 or 1889, the grant was
eut up for sale by auction, the reserved
portion was peacefully included in the area
for sale. To prevent all misconception, the
mictioneer impressively read out that clause
m the deed which specified that the owner had
>m earthly right to the water-frontage, and
then explained that “we” utterly refused to
recognise the reservation, and were going to
sell the reserved portion at the buyer’s risk.
The offer excited no enthusiasm, and the water-
frontage remained unsold. After that litigation
commenced, and the case was promptly decided
in favor of the State with damages. Then in
1891, the grantees applied to the Full Court for
a new trial, which was emphatically refused.
Next, the case was dragged to the Privy
Council, which is reported as having
“reserved its decision.” What the decision
will be when it ceases to be reserved no one
can tell at present, but as to the bill of costs
there can be no possible shadow of doubt
whatever. The case for the grantees rests
on 00 years’ alleged possession, and the case
for the Crown depends to some extent on a
letter written in 1878 asking that the grant
should be issued, which the Full Court held
as proof that the alleged possession—if there
was any, and if adverse possession counts
against the Crown, which, according to common
opinion, it does not—is now Only 1(5 years old
at the most. But, apart from these legal quib-
bles, the wild humor of the situation lies in the
fact that the State may sell a certain well-
defined piece of land at a low figure, and then
have to spend the purchase-money several times
over in law-courts to prevent the buyer tak-
ing the State’s own adjacent property, when he
doesn’t even pretend to show that he paid for
it or has any documentary title to it. The law
of the plaintifi’s case may be all right, for all
The Bulletin knows to the contrary, but its
moral aspect looks atrocious, and it seems about
time that all titles by possession were formally
abolished by Act of Parliament. Where a
landowner disappears leaving his property un-
claimed it should revert, not to anybody who
likes to take possession of it, but (as in Maori-
land) to the State. The title by possession,
whether in the case of private or Crown lands,
is a legalised steal pure and simple.
Unprotection.
An old allegory has it that a farmer put cats in
the cheese-room to prevent the ravages of rats,
and the cats ate the cheese. The Vic. Tariff
Board has just elicited the allegory in this
shape :
Mr. J. F. Richardson, manager of the Colonial Sugar
Refinery Company, was called. He was asked to give his
reasons why the differential rate, involving concession to
the local industry of £1 per ton, should not be abolished.
What is the product of the local refinery ?—34,790 tons
per annum.
Then your company has been making £1 profit on
each ton to the amount of close on £35,000 ?—No
answer.
The loss to the Customs revenue since 1887 has been
over £200,000. What was your dividend last year?—Ten
per cent.
How much did you carry forward ? About £7OOO. The
dividend absorbed £82,000 of the profits.
Has your company any differential rate in the other
colonies ?—No.
Yet you refine successfully there?—Yes.
Is it true that you control the market of Victoria?—
No ; not altogether.
Is it true, then, that you are gelling your sugar in New
South Wales at a lower price than in Victoria ? Prices
are about the same.
Now, why should your company extract £35,000 per
annum out of the revenue of this overburdened colony
when you are able to pay such enormous profits ? —We
could do witli less.
Do you not undersell any shipment that arrives, so as
to keep the business to yourself ?—Yes. We reduce our
prices.
Is it true you can wipe out all competition from this
market?—We never do it.
Does your company require the differential rate any
longer?—Yes. If we had not some encouragement we
would manufacture in Sydney and Brisbane, where we
could get coal cheaper, and where it would suit us better
in many ways. We could manufacture at seven shillings
cheaper in New South Wales.
The Freetrader would advocate the abolition of
the protective cats; but the Protectionist would
simply keep the cats for their purpose, and
prevent them from getting more than a reason-
able portion of the cheese. In the case in point
the Colonial Sugar Refinery, which lately ab-
sorbed its nominal opponent, has in form and
fact become an aggressive monopoly. It has
never served a true protective purpose. The
Protection that would play off Sydney against
Melbourne, or Melbourne against Brisbane, is
mere parochial inanity. Each city has its place
in Australian unity, and the sooner Australian
imposts are taken off Australian sugars the
better.
Some Victims of Competition.
The Vic. Tariff Enquiry Board is largely a trap
for woolly - headed Freetraders, who came
snorting into the board-room armed with argu-
ments against their blessed creed. The louder
a witness cries for lower duties the more reason
he shows, in almost every case, for a further
10 per cent, addition to his burden of woe.
Having hoisted himself with his own petard he
hugs the strange delusion that he has blown
Protection to bits, and awaits with confidence
an Argus account of how he “ emphatically
condemned the tariff.” The virtues of Protec-
tion can be made more clear by an indignant
importer than by any Trades Hall orator on
earth, judging from the latest Melbourne
revelations. For instance, David Altson,
manufacturer and importer of saddlery and
harness, informed the Enquiry Board that
the high tariff had ruined him. When
the duties were moderate he did a
good trade, but now he doesn’t. He ascribed
tliis personal calamity to bad times and “ ex-
cessive coin-petition, caused by the high tariff.'”
Duly 50 saddle-trees were imported into Vic-
toria last year, and he was the man who im-
ported them. “As soon as a hoy can make a
saddle he starts as a manufacturer. So long
as it is a saddle of some sort people will
buy it,” he said. Thus the trade slips
away from middleman Altson, and that’s
where his ruination comes in. E. Evans, an
ex-portmanteau-maker, was another witness
with a Freetrade grievance. “He had to give
up business as a manufacturer on account of the
competition induced by the tariff.” When the
duty was only 10 per cent, he could manu-
facture at a profit, but when the higher duty
quite blocked the way for foreign portmanteaux,
smaller manufacturers came into the trade and
knocked F. Evans out of time. The style of
;>■eduction, by the way, must have mightily
.i proved whilst Evans was losing his business,
seeing that “no duty is required now, for the
local article is cheaper than the imported.”
Yet Evans thinks that lower duties would
give “ a healthier tone ” to the business.
Altson and Evans are two fair specimens of
the Freetrade, alias Tariff Amendment party
in Victoria. They object to Protection because
it bas made manufacturers of “ boys’’—who
ought to be filling humble positions in the
employ of Altson or Evans. Saddles and
portmanteaux of local production supply all, or
nearly all, the local demand, but there is no
satisfaction in that circumstance for men who
ceased to flourish when Victoria left off send-
ing money abroad for these goods. Where is
the good of Protection, if it induces keen com-
petition, and spoils the fine, old-fashioned,
gigantic-profit businesses of Altson and
Evans ?
Protected Hats.
The following extraordinary statement about
the cost of hats in England and Victoria is
taken from the evidence of an importer (the
agent of Christie and Co., London) before Vic.
Tariff Board ;
The lowest-priced hats were made in Victoria for 7s. 6d.
per dozen, while in England they cost 145., which with
duty and charges amounted to 20s. a dozen landed in
Victoria. This large difference left ample room for a
reduction of duty. Hard felt hats were made in Victoria
for tos. a dozen, and in England for 16s. a dozen. Duty
and charges brought the price of English hard felt hats
landed in Victoria up to (17s. per dozen. On men’s hats,
which cost 20s. per dozen to manufacture in Victoria and
30s. in England, there was also great room for reductions.
This is the Argus report, and the items have
been compared with the Age report and found
to agree exactly. The importing class usually
declares that manufacturing is necessarily dearer
in Australia than England ; but when it has to
turn the opposite plea into an argument for
Freetrade, it probably would not hesitate to
stultify itself by a right-about-face. In this
case the importer may be telling the truth,
though it seems almost too good to be true.
The importer pleads for a reduction in the
tariff to enable him to rehabilitate his vanished
trade. Of course, the Vic. market would not
be immediately rushed, and efforts made at any
expense to crush out the local manufacturer in
the interests of the importer. No ; The
Bulletin believes that the time has now come
in Vic. when the State should assist the im-
porters who have been led astray by Freetrade
fallacies. The poor wretches have not only had
their pet theories turned inside-out by Protec-
tion, bub they have lost their living as well.
The time is now come for the abolition of the
protective tariff on hats, and the institution in
the interest of the importers of an excise-duty
on locally-made hats, so that the product of
England, which country has not the manufac-
turing advantages of Victoria, may compete on
equal terms with the Vic. product within Vic.
boundaries.
It should be the early business of some Demo-
cratic and patriotic Australian member of Par-
liament in each Assembly of the Australasian
provinces to submit to the House of which he is
a member some such resolutions as these
(1) That this House declares that it is not only unneces-
sary hut prejudicial to Australian interests that any Aus-
tralian Judge should be appointed a member of the
Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council; and
that this House absolutely refuses to vote any portion of
the salary of any such Privy Councillor.
(2.) That the time has arrived for the establishment of
an Australian Federal Court of Appeal for the final hear-
ing and settlement of all purely Australian legal disputes.
(a) That it be an instruction to the Government to
take immediate steps, with the other Australian Govern-
ments, for the establishment of an Australian Federal
Court of Appeal.
(4.) That the Governor be requested to forward these
resolutions to the British authorities.
Let one People’s Member in each People’s House
move some such resolutions as the above, and
let the people watch and note which represen-
tatives are faithful to their popular trust, and
which are ready to aid in the consummation of
the biggest lawyers’ job ever yet proposed in
Australia. The submission of direct resolutions
is the readiest way of completely checkmating
the audacious thimble-rigging of the so-called
Federal Council.
There is a temptation to hail the Tory journa-
list as the humorist of all centuries. The poli-
tical leading articles of the S.M. Herald and
the Argus, for instance, often leave the idea
that they are written by a coterie of practical
jokers, whose greed for laughter is so excessive
that nothing short of the daily befoolment of a
nation will satisfy them. In a recent issue of
the Argus a practical joke on Humor itself is
attempted. In a review of a book by one
Agnes Repplier (no woman, by the way, was
ever much of a humorist) the Argus says :
Mr. Mark Twain’s “ A Yankee at the Court of King
Arthur” was immensely admired in America, while in
England it is considered a piece of profane buffoonery,
equally/ vulgar and pointless. It is much to Miss
Repplier s credit that she says nothing of Mark Twain.
As a set-off to this, a parson named Hole is
held' up to admiration.
His chapter on “Bores” is especially delightful for its
wit, gaiety, and a pleasant exaggeration in*the style of
Sydney Smith. Nearly every sentence embodies some
wholesome jest.- There is the story of the deaf man who
meeting a friend of the bore tribe, produced carefully
from his pocket an elaborate ear-trumpet, one end of
which having been adjusted with some pains in the
defective organ the other was handed with a smile to the
bore’s mouth, who shouted down it, “ You are breaking
very last.’’
The italics are supplied by the Argus. It
remains to be seen whether the S.M. Herald
will be able to do anything to equal the Argus’
practical joke, Hole v. Mark Twain. It is
possible that the S.M. Herald won’t need the
help of the italics. We shall see.
Some enlightened and enterprising statesman
who wants to reduce the outgoings of Australia
might turn his attention with advantage to the
patent-medicine question. This country, on a
rough estimate, sends away annually £250,000
for patent-medicines alone. A very large pro-
portion of these is admittedly rubbish of the
meanest descriptions, and a great part of the
balance may be declared with confidence to be
of very little account. No intelligent person
takes patent medicines seriously, or is ever
likely to do so. They are the fetish of the
ignorant and superstitious who love to revel in
pills and in great quantities of loathsome
draughts and potions, and who put an evil-
smelling enemy into their mouths to steal away
their bowels. The average patent-medicine sells
for about nine times its intrinsic cost, even
estimating that cost on the liberal scale
of the apothecary, and it fetches that
exorbitant price solely because each P.nmnmi rv /I
has its own particular crowd of worshippers
who—having come to believe that they live by
it alone —would probably buy it at three times
the price if necessary. Considering the amount
of good legal tender which is sent abroad
annually on account of this superstition, and
how little value is obtained in return, some
enterprising Covernment might make a start by
declaring that no patent for any medicine, and
no copyright of the name of any proprietary
remedy, shall hold good within its province.
Another way of meeting the case would be to
levy 1000 per cent, duty on all imported
patent medicines, and still another would be to
prohibit their importation altogether. Just
now Australia wants to cut down its outgoings
as far as possible, and, therefore, The Bulle-
tin looks with an unfriendly eye on that
<£250,000 per annum which is sent abroad to
buy the means of wrecking this nation’s
digestion, and enamelling its bright young
countenance, and vainly smearing the bald spot
on its youthful head, and otherwise attempting
to lend it a fatal beauty which is not its own.
A certain Miss Lee, acting as spokesfemale of
a goody-goody society at Wellington (M.L.),
demands that “marriages should be strictly
supervised by the State, and that no unhealthy
couples, or women under 20 or over 40 years of
age, or men under 25 or over 45 years of age,
should be allowed to marry.” The idea—espe-
cially as concerns the “unhealthy couples is
theoretically perfect, but The Bulletin doubts
much if Miss Lee has the courage to effectually
carry out her theory. It has met many
gaunt and enthusiastic females with a similar
theory, but it never yet met one with sufficient
pluck to carry it to its necessary and logical
conclusion. The trouble lies, not in the mar-
riage of old and unhealthy persons, which
really doesn’t matter, hut in their having
children and thus handing down their
shattered and diseased constitutions to future
generations. If they can be prevented
from marrying and handing down the
shattered constitution lawfully, they will do
it unlawfully. Therefore, the well-meaning
society brings up with a crash against the
following series of alternatives .-—(I) All
girls under 20 and unmarried women over 40
must be kept in strict confinement. (2) All
youths under 25 must be kept in strict confine-
ment. (3) All men. over 45 must either
be executed, or imprisoned for life, or
rendered incapable of propagating their
species. Or else (4) all children, legitimate or
otherwise, born of unhealthy parents, or of
parents of prohibited ages, must be killed ; and
(5) all illegitimate children whose fathers are
unknown must he killed in any case, on the off-
chance that the missing parent is over age,
or under age, or disqualified by ill-health.
And, speaking of ages, what age is Miss Lee ?
Also, what is the average age of the gooefy-
goody society which she represents? It «mst
have quite a lot of creases in its neck.
A veteran N.S.W. fruitgrower told the
Sydney conference last week that, if canned Aus-
tralian fruits only had a Californian label on the
can, the consumers were willing to pay an extra
6d. a tin for them. Just so. Australia is its own

A suggestive criticism on Queensland
worthies, dropped in conversation the other day :
Griffith will knock an adversary down with a
bloodless syllogism, M‘llwraith with a knuckly
human fist.” Time was when it was very true.
By the introduction of a new machine for
oiling locomotives, which exactly regulates the
supply according to the requirements, instead of
‘sloshing ” the lubricator on by hand in the old
style, the annual oil-bill on the Vic. railways has
been reduced from ,£27,000 to about.£lo,ooo.
Dear Bulletin, —In a recent issue you
suggested that author Anthony Hope might be
related to Vic.’s Gov. This is not so. Anthony
Hope Hawkins is the son of liev. William Haw-
king vicar of St. Bride’s, in the city of Loudon.
He was president of the Oxford Union once, is an
ardent Badical and a barrister, though latterly he
has thrown over law for books. His “Half a
Hero,” dealing with Australian gubernatorial life
led many wise critics to assume an Australian
birthright for him. As a matter of fact, he has
never been to this country. —Yours, R.C.B.
London Literary World—a dull little
weekly which makes a more or less dishonest
living by scissoring long passages from newly-
published books and hashing them up with a few
lines of inept comment—and which wouldn’t be
here noticed but that it has been quoted with
sweet approval by certain Australian friends of
The Bulletin— naturally appreciates the talents
displayed by one E. H. Canuey in the clipping
without acknowledgment, from various Australian
sources (including The Bulletin) enough litera-
ture to liven-up a volume called “ The Land of the
Dawning ” (stolen title). These birds of a feather
unite in hatred of The Bulletin, and the
Literary World remarks that this paper is,
“ without question, the vulgarest in the English
language ; it is the organ of the Australian larri-
kin (stolen phrase). Such testimonials as these
from the galled jades of cant, rant and wooden-
headed “respectability ” are inexpressibly cheer-
ing to The Bulletin aforesaid.
The Orange Leader is a paper whose
political rhymes are much quoted in N.S.W.
The Leader’s barrel-organist is Mr. W. T.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK,
Hrr Majesty's “Bhck-Ey.d Susan.’*
Lyceum “ The Sportsman ” and
“ The Open Gate.”
Theatre Royal “The Union Jack.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre ... “Cinderella.”
Buou “ A Wife's Ordeal.”
Otbka House “ Harry Rickards’ Co.”
Geo. Rignold’s pantomime, “The House
that Jack Built,” will close at the end of this
week after a run of two months. Business on the
whole has been profitable, especially considering
that the public enthusiasm about pantomime isn’t
what ft was. On Saturday “ Black-eyed Susan ”
is to be staged, with a burlesque to follow. Her
Majesty’s, by the way, now hangs out the baleful
announcement that the free-list has been suspended
by the neck until it is dead, dead, dead and utterly
deceased.
* * *
The “ Union Jack” is to be staged next
Saturday at Sydney Royal, and some spirit-
stirring allusions to the manner in which the old
flag waves, and the dangers which arise when you
tread on its tail and thus arouse its heart of oak,
may be confidently looked for. Bland Holt’s
season, so far, has been the best thing that has
happened to the Royal for a long while. Even
Maggiie Moore, despite her success, did not wake
up that old establishment so effectively as Bland
has done of late.

To-morrow (Friday), Titheradge sows the
wind at Sydney Lyceum for the last time, and
thereafter the moral that is contained in his gouty
foot will be seen no more during the present
season. At this late hour, it has just occurred to
The Bullet.n that the ancient text needs to be
revised and brought' up to date; nowadays, he
who sows the wind reaps, not the whirlwind, bub
an enormously swollen hoof, which ripens in his
latter years, and stays with him like a bulbous
ghost of the drinks that he had in his youth.
Titheradge’s gout is a work of art, and suggests
long study of the misshapen extremities of many
superannuated and corny revellers. Also, it
arouses the reflection that the sere-and-yellow
tvvell generally repents with his feet, when he
t-pents at all. On Saturday, the B. and B. co.
makes a new departure with the “Sportsman”
(produced by arrangement with Plain Bill Hol-
loway) and the “ Open Gate,” a one-act play by
Haddon Chambers, both of which pieces have
never yet been seen in Sydney. The new bill is
to boom for six nights only.

When last heard from, Woodloch’s circus

Although Melbourne didn’t ask for a third
pantomime in one season the “ Cinderella” experi-
ment, at the Princess’s, is quite successful. Miss
Ida Osborne is not much like the ideal younger
sister that Nellie Stewart created in days of yore,
but she sings prettily and plays her little part
with spriglitlinesa. The silvery tenor is not
allowed to leave the stage until he has accepted a
second encore and told his love for Sally,
and, notwithstanding the absurdity of that
mawkish ballad, he gets much applause
for the effort. No man, of course, could
live in an alley in patent-leather boots. The
Baron’s delicately-modulated foot-notes inspire
sympathy even in the dress-circle, where a clog-
dancer seldom finds friends, also the ballets and
the general gorgeousness of “ Cinderella ” are
matters for admiring comment. The theatre
itself, as already mentioned, is a feast of new
beauty. Anyone who doesn’t trouble to contem-
plate the decorations can stroll out into the vesti-
bule and sniff the odour of paint drying away in
the distance.

Harry Rickards awoke Melbourne Opera
House on Saturday with a vigor worthy of that
indomitable warrior. A fine large waterfall at
the rear gave an air of distance and distinction to
the opening “set,” and a new variety company,
mostly taken over from Sydney Tivoli, made
things fairly lively, apart from the sole lessee.
When Mr. H. Rickards came up with his “little
lot,” the festivity w.axed furious. In a few
minutes he had fully 50 per cent, of a crowded
audience singing the martial chorus of “ ’E dunno
where ’e are,” and the mfection appeared to be
spreading so fast that there wouldn’t have been a
silent member left in the theatre if the chorus had
held out' a_ little longer. They would all have
assisted to swell the triumph of ’Arry’s strain.
Finally, he made a speech full of emotion and art-
ful business announcements, from which his
auditors, who by this time loved Rickards better
than life itself, gathered that he was game to act
handsomely by them on fair and reasonable provo-
cation. Hhe found it good enough to run the
dingy old houses he-would be good enough to put
a new face on it entirely, said the youthful
veteran.

The ©acres a»e understood, at time of
writing, to be due at Melbourne Bi|ou on Satur-
day, when they will produce “ A Wife’s Ordeal,”
for the first time, worth mentioning, on any stage.
It is a melodramatic play, of the purely domestic
ordfef, designed by G. R. Sims for the two artists,
who bear most of the heat and burden of
the plot. Miss Amy Roselle has to pull through
the ordeal aforesaid, whilst her husband ap-
pears as a highly-polished villain. Elton
takes a short, but sweet, comedy part.
Miss Mabel Hardy, from Great Britain, and
Wilfrid Shine are in the cast ; and the artless
young girl of the story is Mias Muriel Carr, whose
portrait embellishes The Bulletin’s latest num-
ber. There are but two other minor characters in
“ A Wife’s Ordeal,” which spreads over four acts
and requires tirst-class acting, accordingly. There
is no opposition novelty to clash with the Dacres’
debut, so the Bijou ought to be crowded on Satur-
day for the first time these two years.

The pantomime season at the Royal closed
on Saturday last. At the matinee performance a
deputation of Chow children testified to Maggie
Moore’s kindness of heart. In the evening the
leading lady received a load of floral compliments,
and after curtain-fall, it is said, shed a few fare-
well tears. Miss Maggie Moore and Co. leave for
Adelaide this week, thence to Broken Hill and
other places before reaching Sydney.

David Syme moralises re the bloatered
Earl of Yarmouth :
Were it not for the imperious dicta of omnipotent
fashion, no one will venture to say that the earl’s high-
kiaking in the cause of shanty has anything in it that is
not entirely praiseworthy.
If charity is the gearl’s sole excuse, why not go
round with a mon-key on an organ in the sacred
cause? or stand at street corners and invite the
lord-loving people to drop shillings in his gaudy
coronet? The earl’s idiotsyncrasy might be excus-
ableuf it were clever; but the gyrations of a clumsy
noble who fancies he can dance and invites people
to pay to find out his mistake can never be praise-
worthy, In point of fact, the earl is artistically
below the level of the two-headed sheep at the
snide museum.

The vaunted Tasmanian Exhibition, at
Hobart, has settled down to be a profound and un-
obtrusive failure. Solemn silence pervades the
great, half-empty barn, and visitors go round
with an air of hushed reverence, as though on a
visit to a cathedral. They speak in whispers, and
walk on tiptoe over the rough plank floors, so as
not to wake the echoes. If they speak loudly, an
official approaches heavily but 'stealthily, and be-
seeches them in a husky undertone to be more
subdued. Lately, some side-show people came
along and filled the place with stentorian apneals
to the people to roll up. Then, for a day or'two,
the thin audience awoke, and seemed almost
cheerful, till the Cmrarnission'ers descended heavily
on the side-show desecrators, and ordered that,
for the future, they must shout in a whisper. The
said shows paid from .£25 to .£5O apiece for the
right'to exhibit, and, as no one can run a side-
show in decorous silence, the large, dank hand of
authority has practically wiped them out, and
they talk of leaving. Also, some of the Exhi-
bition shareholders think of abandoning the whole
desolate undertaking, and closing up two months
before their appointed time. The great Exhi-
bition is the flattest thing that ever happened,
even in Tasmania.

The N.S.W. Executive Commissiolier’s
report is not the only expensive job issued by the
Government Printer in connection with Chicago
Show. What has become of the tens of thousands
of copies of “The Drama and Music in N.S. W.,’’
which poor W. F. Terry (who deserves all the
credit for fixing up the N.S.W. Court) was sup-
posed to distribute, to let the Americans know
that a corrobboree, or even a circus, was not the
only entertainment in Australia? Is. 6d. is the
price demanded for the book on its cover; but
people wouldn’t take it for nothing. Terry got
quite ashamed of the thing at last, and hid the
books away under the counters that ran around
the court. When R. S. Smythe arrived at
Chicago, Terry asked him, being in the line, what
he thought he had better do with them. The
Much-Travelled advised him to burn them. No
American man or woman could possibly feel the
slightest interest in the music and drama of Aus-
tralia; the only people who might care to see the
book were old Australian pro.’s, and they were
mostly dead. What has become of those tons of
printing? Did Terry take Smythe’s advice, and
was that the eause of the fire at the World’s Fair?
At Poverty Point.
Alfred Nathan, of whom little has been heard since he
went to Paris, will, it is stated, make his in August
next. Alfred is studying hard under Signor Sbriglia—
the male Marches!—on whose advice he threw up his
splendtdprospectsin a leadinggydney legal firm to pursue
grand opera. Mr. Nathan has certainly a fine vdtce and a
splendid stage appearance.
The bad old nobleman In “Sowing the Wind ’’has an
excellent polish on his cynicism. How cultured his style
of acquainting Mrs. Baough with her parent’s decease—
“ Your respected mother’s portrait hangs now in tjiy
gallery of recollections. Need I add that she hangs on
the line.”
Katharine Hagjy, who doddie-doddied with the (searl
of Yarmouth at JJflb. Bijou, has now shaken ofl the dust
of burlesque and Ts going to stick to comedy. She is a
pretty girl, with a natural fund of wit and more intel-
ligence than marks the usual stage aspirant. She is
chaperoned at all her stage engagements by a big sister.
The first thing a stage novice must learn is to stand up
straight. Girls seem to be worse sinners than young men
in this respect. If the average debutante held a long
piece of string in her mouth, the other end of it would
touch the ground about 6in. in front of her boots.
When Nina Boucioauit relinquished her part in the
London production of “Charley's Aunt,” it was taken up
by Mabel Lane, daughter of the high priestess of the City
Club Hotel, Melbourne. The attractive Mabel was the
daughter known as “ Chios ” behind the bar, on account
of her facial resemblance to an undraped young person in
a certain French picture. “Chloe” (the picture, not
Miss L.) is well-nigh forgotten now. A dozen years ago,
in the darker ages of Melbourne art, she hung on the wall
of the Public Gallery in Swanston-street, whilst the Scotch
Saw bath fraternity cursed her on their knees at night and
cal «d upon the Government to take her away. Finally,
Napoleonic Fitzgerald, the surgeon, bought poor Chloe
and took her away, after which the Kirk breathed more
freely. Nowadays, the dark-haired nymph could defy
Pharisaism to shift her from the Gallery. Melbourne
has been educated up to her chaste nudity in the mean-
time.
Yarmouth, the Dancing Gear!, was down at Mornlngton
(Vic.) last week, recovering frown the effects of his thea-
trical “crazy fit.” The dale of his threatened arrival at
Sydney is uncertain, Imt it seems that the belted young
Gearl has definitely decided not to open in Sidney as
Gimlet, Prince of Denmark.
On Boxing-night, at the Elephant and Castle Theatre
(London), the clown went on and fooled with wooden legs
of mutton whilst his wife lay cold in the green-room. She
played in the opening, but had the misfortune to drop
dead at the wings after singing in a duet with another
girl. [The post-mortem showed that she died of light-
lacing.] The pantomime went on as though nothing had
happened, ditto the clown as aforesaid. This story
wouldn’t be complete without a mention of the inevitable
tears that washed the paint off the widower’s face whilst
a sympathetic brother mummer was making him up for
the part. The idi a of “the broken-hearted clown
struggling bravely against his grief ” has been worn
threadbare in fiction, but here it is in fact.
Yarmouth, on succeeding to the Hertford title, will
become the patron of three clerical livings. When he

P. : Strange how fiction recalls fact, Wheatley’s
MTntyre fitches to my mind travelling on the North
Eastern, Vic., with a boozy old Scot in the railway
carriage. He was asking everyone, “ D'ye know

can tell her ye saw her old father drunk in the train.”
Arthur Daore’s real name is James. He is an M.D. and

Luscombe Searelle took the chair at the Savage Club
gathering, one night a while ago, but the privilege cost
him dear. It seems that a subscription-list had been
opened for the widow of Gwyliym Crowe. Searelle called
attention to this deserving case, and offered as, haw 1
chairman, to put his name down for the highest amount
that any other gentleman would like to subscribe. Little
W. S. Penley promptly oast a gloom over Searelle’s soul
by passing up a cheque for £25, whereat the club chuckled
with Savage delight. The chairman had not considered
Penley’s affluence before he so rashly spoke, or perhaps
it didn’t occur to him that any actor who could afford a
£25 joke would be glad to play it on the inflated person
from South Africa.
Poor Edna Grace ! She complains, in an affidaviß, that
while Elton and Shine regularly got their money, she had

sitting on the stage, waiting for the curtain to go up—
after £5O had been counted in her lap, while the hungry-
eyed 00. looked on.
Hadden Chambers, writes The Bulletin’s London cor-

Arthur Roberts, interviewed a few weeks ago, said he
thought he would have to do his Claude Duval as a one-

actors and actresses live too fast, and their stamina is so

Edith Chester’s, that alone makes a lot of them ill.

Dear Bulletin,—Why don’t Australian impresarios look
up the fresh young voices of the bush ? I know many a

The Queen, we read, has been graciously pleased to
enquire after the health of actress Mrs. Beerbohm Tree and
her new baby. This royal solicitude is accounted for by
the recent appearance of Mrs. Tree at Balmoral, when the
company had to bolt away to Dublin a few minutes after
the curtain fell. Naturally, Her Gracious felt interested
under the circumstances.
Once upon a time an Adelaide manager who had a
grudge against the papers invited all the youngsters
(office-boys and printer’s devils) connected with the two
dailies to see his play, ushered them into a conspicuous
section of the dress-circle, put up a notice that “These
seats are reserved for members of the press,” and then
went about among the audience, and, pointing to the
notice, said, in aggrieved tones: “Those are the sort of
ignoramuses the newspapers send to criticise our per-
formance.”

A Louden paper remarks that the fun of “Dr. Bill ” is
already old-fashioned, and the once riotous “kangaroo
dance ” now seems a mild enough affair. Which doesn’t
alter the fact that the very old comedies are still the very
giddiest that a manager dare stage. Think of Maw-
worm in “The Hypocrite”—“ I was married to my wife
for many years before she blessed me with a child, but
then Dr. Cantwell came and used to pray with my wife—
alone - and now she’s got a baby I O ! he’s a good man.”
Surely the time is ripe for revivals of “ The Hypocrite ”
and its like.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make#
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

A.J.S. Bank shares have considerably recovered

It is now broadly hinted in the daily press
that the Commercial Bank of Australia won’t meet its
postponed deposits when they fall due, but w ill endeavour
to make some new arrangement with its creditors.
“As for the old bank,” said James Service, M.L.C. and
chairman of directors, “it would he able to show, at the
end of 3.j years, when its liabilities matured, such a state
of things as would entitle them to the benefit of the
principle upon which business was usually conducted
betwee i man and man and institution and institution,
and which would entitle them to ask for a rearrangement
which would be of benefit both to the shareholders and
the depositors.” All “which” appears to distinctly
imply that the Commercial of Australia doesn’t see its
way to release its deposits before maturity, as so many
other banks have done.
Even despite the acknowledgment made by Mr.
Service that more time might be required, the old man
bluffed as vigorously as ever about the magnificent posi-
tion of the new Commercial, and said that certain recent
rumors concerning it almost amounted to “conspiracy.”
There are certain things about the institution which
ought to make Mr. Service just a shade more humble.
The Commercial stopped the payment of interest on
£2,100,000 of deposits by turning them into preference-
shares which now receive no dividend, and thus the
average interest payable on its fixed deposits is only a
fraction over 3 per cent. But for this saving the new
bank would now show something much more like a loss
than a dividend. Moreover, the increased net profit
for last half-year, which made the institution feel so
wildly self-confident, arose almost wholly out of a vigorous
reduction of expenses, for the earnings of the bank are
painfully small. Tub Bulletin knows of no actual reason
why it Shouldn’t pull through in the end, and sincerely
hopes to see it do so, but as a source of permanent in-
come to the shareholders its present prospects are not re-
assuring.
* * * *
Two years ago James Service lashed himself
into a frenzy of confidence in the Old Bank and
its assets. Two hundred tall, black hats beat the
air for simulated joy when he predicted that prefer-
ence shares in the grand Old Bank reconstructed would
be as negotiable as bank-notes at par. The other day he
was merely on bowing terms with the Old Bank, so to
speak. The ingenious gentleman begged his audience to
remember that he was talking about a New Bank alto-
gether—a beautiful, bright financial infant with liabilities
amounting to only £1,800,000 against assets totting up to
£4,800,000. He asked the meeting if any harm could pos-
sibly come to such a bank, and the meeting smiled super-
ciliously at the bare thought of it. Also James Service
volunteered an assurance (scarcely necessary from a
chairman) that he was speaking the whole truth, and no-
thing but the truth, when he said that the New Board
were not implicated in the Old Bank, which, two
•years before, he had been so proud of. Yet he
■admitted that a golden thread of kinship joined
ithe Old Bank and the New. He was glad, for in-
• stance, to note a great rise (after a greater fall,
• which he did not note) in the price of ‘‘our preference
(Shares, and a considerable rise in the price of our deposit
(receipts.” The humor of it ! Said deposits were in the
•Old Bank, and if the New Bank has only £1,800,000 of
liabilities on its back there was nothing to justify that
(personal pronoun in the possessive case. The joke thick-
ened when James Service said “ there are no liabilities of
sthe Old Bank that mature till a period still to come of
meanly 3J years, so that for 3J years, supposing every-
thing to go wrong at the end of that period, we are abso-
lutely safe.”

Ait the Bank of Victoria half-yearly meeting a
(Shareholder “wished to know if a distinction would be
rshown between the affairs of the old bank and the new in

ireplied that “ it was all one hank, as the new bank had
taken over the assets and liabilities of the old.” The
■shareholder remarked that the Commercial Bank had
made a very great difference, but the matter dropped
•with a sickening thud. The Bulletin now regards Mr.
lEdward Miller as a lost vessel. He doesn’t understand
ithe ghostly independence of the two commingled Banks
•of Victoria, and he is in danger of having to beg hereafter
■.a. cup of cold water from James Service, who believed and

At the half-yearly meeting of Melb. Tram Co.

The B.N.Z. reports a loss of ,£20,416 for the
half-year ended 30th Sept., ’94, and no div. is declared.
The profits, as show n by the balance-sheet issued in March
last, were at the rate of £20,500 for the half-year, so that
there is a change for the had amounting to nearly £41,000.
Part of t his perhaps £lO,OOO or sa—may fairly be set
down to the fact that interest had to be paid on a large
amount of the new State-guaranteed 4 per cent, capital
which could not be safely invested quite as fast as itoame
in, therefore a certain loss was inevitable before the bank
fairly set I led down to its new conditions. The rest of the
lamentable discrepancy seems to be pure disaster. The
note circulation has fallen off by £50,000. Deposits show
a drop of half-a-rnillion. The coin has increased by
£200,000, but the discounts and bills receivable have
dropped by something like £1,000,000, which looks like a
serious decline in business, though it is probably only a
temporary fall caused hv the hank’s s raitened condition
of a few months ago. Also, the “ Investments in British
Consols, &c.,” have increased by £540,000. Making all
possible allowance for the “&c.,” the interest on this
item can hardly exceed 3J per cent, all round, and half-a-
million borrowed at 4 per cent, and invested at 3J is not
calculated to yield an immediate profit. As already fore-
shadowed, £300,000 more is to be written off to cover
losses, and the call of £3 6s. Bd. per share was made on
this account. Having thus got over about ihe most excit-
ing half-year in its history, grave hopes are entertained
that the B.N.Z. will present a b-U'r aspect when
next heard from. Next May, £750,000 worth of the
Estates Co.'s ruinous debentures are to he paid off, and
this alone should cause a perceptible change for the

mighty electrical scheme for illuminating Sydney by

have the individual checking of his figures by a round
dozen or so of experts. The Sydney Corporation is now
endeavoring to get an electric-lighting Bill through Par-
liament, so that Gipps is determined to be well in time
with his proposals. His scheme includes the construction
of a storage reservoir of 600,000,000 gallons at Kenny Hill;
the tunnelling of the dividing-range by a 4-raile tunnel
carrying 30in. pipes, and giving a fall of 256 ft. in the
distance, the overflow of the water on turbine-w heels, etc.,

Baker's Creek Co., the Eleanora’s elder sister,
still prospers. It is about the only steady-dividend-paying
N.S.W. gold-mine. During the past half 5677 tons ore
gave 88220zj. gold, and 21 tons of concentrates 96ozs. gold
and 1350z5. silver. The percentage of gold shows a slight
decrease. Management and wages come to £12,471155. 9d.;
£15,000 has been paid in divs, ; present year begins
£7974 16s. Bd. to credit. Since (in ’B7) the mine started,
45,500 tons of ore,have given over 3J tons of gold, and
£307,500 has been paid to the shareholders, mostly Vic-
torian and S.A. speculators.
After all the praise for years lavished on the
square-set timbering in Broken Hill, it is now admitted
by the directors themselves that had it never been
used and the mine always worked, as now, on the

been distributed in divs. A million of money to-day
represents more than one-half the value of the mine,

prospector regained possession, and worked the minei
until one morning he was found at the bottom of the

erection of machinery, leases of large areas often shut out
bona-fide miners. The remedy seems to be indicated pro-
perly in a resolution passed at the last Miners’ Confer-
ence : “That no leases should be issued on any new gold-
field for three years after discovery’’; and then, after
three years, let the areas of leases be more commensurate
with the needs of the capital required to develop pro-
blematical properties.

Albert Calvert has just published a “West
Australian Mining Manual and Guide to Investors.” After
having got rid of the properties he was interested in, more
or less unsuccessfully, he has now elected to become the
guide, philosopher and friend of the British public, and
to warn them against bogus companies.

The success of the John Woods Co., Stawell,

The Union Co. still holds the big end of the

The New Costerseld Metal Extraction Co.,

According to P.O. Fysh, of Tasmania, Aus-
tralia pays in all £168,000 per annum to London bankers
for “managing” the public debt, said management con-
sisting mostly of paying the half-yearly divs. to bond-
holders. Wanted badly, an amalgamated Agent-General
for all Australia, with a staff of clerks who will keep the
stock-registers for the various provinces, and write out
cheques on the Government account for the divs. Even
if the amalgamated A.-G. got £5OOO a year, and the staff
was constructed on a lavish system, there should he room
to save £150,000 annually.

A plant for treating blood, offal and waste
products generally is being erected at the Riverina
Frozen Meat Works, at Deniliquin (N.S.W.). This
machinery, which is from the Austral Otis Engineering
Works, Melbourne, will convert all the elements, which
were previously a very aggressive nuisance, into a com-
mercial dry manure—a product for which there is ample
steady demand throughout Australasia. This is the
climax of scientific economy—the utilisation of all
natural material without waste. The plant, which is very
complete, is automatic in all its operations.*

Gladstone’s postcard to Parkes wishing

Mr. Justice Stephen (N.S.W.) did not

The Sydney banquet to politician Slattery
last week was attended by Cardinal Moran and

Capt. Gascoigne was a mystery in Sydney
and Melb. naval and commercial circles, a quarter
of a century ago. He had a clever son, and a
schooner yacht. They went on voyages to the
South Seas, presumably, and came back flush of
money, so that some fancied it was gold, and
others a touch of Bully Hayes. At last they dis-
appeared for ever, schooner and all.
Cowra (N.S.W.) boasts the possession of a
gradually - dissolving patriarch named James
Sharpe, 106 years old, twice widowered, and the
father of 15 children. Sharpe’s father lived to be
129, and his mother 124—50 he says, the gay
romancer. However, James is very, very old, and
attributes it largely to the fact that he was alway'
a “fair ” drinker and a heavy smoker.
Premier Forrest (W.A.), the autocratic
boss and personal validator of mining-jumps,
declares that, in the matter of the mail-steamers
calling at Fremantle or Albany, he “ wishes to
avoid Sunday labor at the West Australian port

the earth and the slave that tills the earth,
was always the prize Pharisee, the rigid Sabba-
tarian of his day and generation. Good old
piety !
Parkes has prepared a yarn for his tomb-
stone, they say. He will be described as a direct
descendant of Faulconbridge, the left-handed son
of Richard Coeur de Lion, and the epitaph will
conclude with a verse from an olde Englyshe
ballade :
Ye King upon ye babe didde gaze
And passe these fevve remarks
“Thy royale blood in distante days
S lall fille ye veins of Parkes.”
Lloyd Osbourne, in his memorial volume
recounting the death of Robert Louis Stevenson; —
He lay in the ball which was ever his pride, where he
had passed the gayest and most delightful hours of his
life, a noble room with open stairway and mullioned
windows.
People generally understand that the novelist
lived and died in a free-and-easy sort of nigger-
built bamboo house. “Mullioned windows!”
Why weren’t they “oriel ” windows? Mr. Lloyd
Osbourne is not so much a novelist as he is the
stepson of a novelist.
From S.M. Herald, 1848 : “As an attor-
ney, Mr. James Martin”—afterwards Chief
Justice—“may attain a respectable position (he
has on one or two occasions made a lucky hit in
tiie Police Court) but his position has not been
tli it of a public man, neither is he trained for a
senator. A man who may cut a tolerable figure
iu argument before a police-magistrate may make
a sorry exhibition in debate before the Speaker
of the Legislative Council. Mr. James Martin is
incorrect in imagining that he is a public man.
He is an attorney, with a fair share of assurance
and some little tact, and we only know him as a
public character from his own proclamations and
assertions.”

This was too much for Georgey Porgey, who left

THOMAS CARLYLE ON SMOKING.
The eminent Scotch philosopher, who was as good!
a judge of a cigar as of a book, used to say that
amongst habits which grow on men, none imposes
itself more than smoking.” But, strange to say,
in order to derive the maximum enjoyment out of
the weed an occasional change in the style of your •
smoke is indispensable. To continue for any
length of time the same brand of cigar or tobacco >
causes the smoker to grow so accustomed to it,,
that his palate gets indifferent to its special blend;.
With a view to meet the, general desire for ai
mild and aromatic smoke, Messrs. J. Frossard andl
Co. have lately brought out their Cavour Cigars ;
they are beautifully packed in neat cases of eight
to be retailed at one shilling. This article fills a
long-felt want for a light smoke, possessing flavor
and delicate aroma, and is certainly the best
value cigar in the market. Once tried, always
liked.

tracted a most violent cold and suffering with
pains in the head and chest, back and kidneys.
My water was highly coloured, and left a purplish

tried Clements Tonic, and am most truly happy
and thankful to state that before finishing one
bottle I was quite cured, and have never suffered
in like manner since. I am positive Clements
Tonic saved me from a prolonged illness, or possi-
bly death, therefore it is with the deepest feelings
of gratitude I can testify to its admirable qualities.

The intrigue to induce Parkes to retire

It is notable that with the advent to office
of Justice-Minister A. J. Gag-Gould the lash is
again being used by the N.S.W. beaks.
It would interest many Frenchmen to
learn whether or not the consul for France at
Sydney made any representations to the author-

Already the ennobbling of Premier Reid is

good luck for Eyeglass’s future if an immediate
adverse vote robbed- him of this chance of pleasing
his wife.
Strange contradiction ! Queensland won’t

The N.S.W. Protectionists who rejoice
because the Reid Government retains their tariff,
are very short-sighted. Should the duties be
repealed as prosperity returns, the cause of Pro-
teotion would be damned for years. r i he average
elector, instead of being able to detect an undis-
tributed middle term, is apt to be entrapped by
tlie fallacy post hoc propter hoc. At the general
election the Dibbs Ministry was condemned for
a state of affairs resulting from the bank smashes,
the stoppage of borrowed money, the labour-
troubles, and other things, for which it was
not responsible. There was method in Parkes’
apparent madness when he flung up_ office to let
his successors pay the penalty of his own folly
and incompetency.
A noticeable feature of the N.S.W. vine-
growers’ conference was the body’s thorough
accord re the fiscal character of the ameliorations
sought. Differential wine and brandy duties as
against outsiders were taken as a prime lever.
The beginning of interprovincial Freetrade
seems to exist in the agreement (made subject to
Parliamentary approval) by which Maoriland is to
admit South Australian fruit, wine, olive oil, and
salt duty-free in return for a similar concession to
Maoriland oats, barley, horses, and hops.
M‘Millau’s contemplated trip to England
suggests the possibility of his temporarily taking
charge of N.S. W. Agent-Generalship if Reid can
perfect his notions on that matter. Saul Samuel
will, in the latter event, retire on leave, and the
interval till the arrival of the new man will, it is
mooted, be at M'Millan’s dispjsal.
Although the Adelaide Labor paper
(Weekly Herald) is barely three months old the
committee-men have already quarrelled with their

that, after working six days a week with pen,
scissors, and paste, he declined to attend the meet-
ings of the Democratic Club on Sunday nights.
As a boss, the “ working man ” is a perfect tiger.
The Queensland and Westralia representa-

will shortly consume to ashes the Forrests, the

Alex. Bruce, chief inspector of N.S.W.
stork, in a paper on “Australian Wines in
England,” sent to the Fruitgrowers’ Conference
at Svdney last week, suggestively laughed at those

that the ‘ Colonial Institute” is of any practical
advantage to them. Bruce recently visited

Ministries, like private individuals, are

to oblige their friends. Thm actuated, the S.A.

exclusive information, to keep sweet with the

A newspaper linotype office intimated
lately thai in the near future most of the hands
employed would be women and girls. This is
Nemesis once more. Not long ago several of the
Typographical Associations declined to allow
women or girls to set type in unionist workshops
as fellow-employes with them. Now, out go the
masterful wearers of trousers and in go petticoats
as bosses of the field. But female cheapness
would have prevailed anyhow.

ing to ex-Pretnier Parkes’ nasty remark that he
believed that he (Reid) had never read a law-
book, pertinently enquires how it was then that
Parkes, when Premier, offered him (Reid) the
Attorney-Generalship. Reid remarks that Parkes
onoe also offered him the Speakership, and he is
proud to be able to say that he always refused to
accept office under Parkes aforesaid. Reid
further points to a three-year-old Parkesian speech

Adelaide Corporation recently decided, by
a narrow majority, to abolish day-lator in all
municipal work and to call for tenders. This
means a saving of about .£5OO a year direct from
the pockets of the workers. The new idea is a
triumph lor the National Ass party, who, when
defeated at the last S. A. elections, ran candidates
for the municipal bodies, and Fuller, M.L.C., and
Tomkinson, ex-M.L.C., were elected aldermen.
These two high Tories are at the bottom of the
cheap-labor reform now to be tried.
From Sydney D.T.’s report of N.S.W.
fruit conference :
Mr. J. Sutton, . . . although a Freetrader, warned
the Government against the danger of removing the duties
from dried fruits until the people had had an opportunity
of cultivating a taste for the local article.
“Although a Freetrader” is most excellent in
this conjunction. It illustrates the fact that the
average Freetrader is prepared to concede the
whole Protectionist ticket, provided that it suits
his own business. But he still calls himself a Free-
trader.
Almost the last official act of the historic
Fitz Gibbon, of the Melb. Board of Works, before
the recent lamentable attempted reduction of his
salary, was to vote against tiie establishment of a
6s. per day minimum wage for the employes of
contractors under the Board, because it would
increase the cost of a certain piece of work from
.£1940 to £2OOO. When the Assembly was dis-
cussing the proposed reduction of Fitz Gibbon’s
own minimum wage, and he came round with a
forbidding expression of countenance to see how
the debate was getting on, people remembered his
own enthusiastic advocacy of cheapness at any
price, and smiled. Why shouldn’t the Board get
its Fitz Gibbon at the lowest possible wage as well
as its pick-and-shovel gentlemen?
Archibald Archer, M.P., the Federal
Councillor who squeaked out —“ Queensland will
not submit to the abolition of Kanaka labor,” is
the senile politician who recently received from
his Rockhampton constituents the most unanimous
request to resign on record. He was M‘ll wraith’s
first Treasurer, and showed such Conspicuous in-
competence, that his first term of office was his last,
and people thanked God for it. He persuaded
himself that he was a C.Q. Separatiomst, and got a
trip to England on the strength of his persuasion;
but he has since changed his mind at the instiga-
tion of the gang in office, and now acts as a wet
blanket to his colleague Curtis’s enthusiasm.
Archer, like Parkes, trades on his white hair ; and
will assuredly be thrown out upon it by the
enraged electors very first chance that offers.
Perhaps the finest specimen of the N.S.W.
special breed of State White Elephant is the just-
opened Marrickville-to-Burwood-Road railway.
It is only five miles long and traverses a small
strip of country—sparsely populated and alto-
gether desolate—between the Suburban and Illa-
warra lines, and close to the classic regions around
Cook’s River. The construction and land-re-
sumption charges reach the respectable total of
<£162,000, or over =£32,000 a mile, and never, by
the wildest stretch of imagination, can the line be
made to pay interest on capital. The only pos-
sible occasion when the route is likely to be
decently patronised will be on race-days at Can-
terbury Park; otherwise, the locality could
hardly support a line of coaches, let alone
a railway. Last week, when a train of six
carriages reached Redfern, there were only
three passengers, including two dead - heads,
and, on the same day, an outward train
contained one solitary second-class passenger.
And yet the Department—the politicians, not the
Department, are responsible for the line’s con-
struction—runs 24 trains a day up and down. One
railway man calculates that the revenue received
should just about pay the cost of grease on the
rolling-stock. In the end, it is asserted, the line
will be closed altogether, or a single horse and car
employed only. Had this enormous amount of
money been spent in laying light lines in good
agricultural districts, it would have been of im-
mense benefit, and returns would have been
assured. At present those benefited are only
they whose land has been resumed.
Queensland Government, at the Boil-
citation of certain pastoralista, sank a bore
in the town of Barcaldine. Result: a mag-
nificent supply of water, which the Govern-
raent proceeded to utilise by clapping thereon
a prohibitive tariff. Protests from the towns-
people were all in vain. Whereupon the
citizens put down a bore of their own, got a splen-
did water-supply, and the Government bore
became the Fed white elephant.
N.S. W. political leaders are
now almost unanimous in prophesying
an appeal to the electors in or before
July next.
Under Freetrade, Great Britain
is said to accumulate annually 65 mil-
lions sterling. Many experts say that
since 1876 she has been 1 sing instead
of gaining. Under Protection America
accumulates annually ICS millions,
and France 75 millions. Under Free-
trade England imports 130 millions
"sterling more than she exports;
Protective America exports more than
she imports. Under Freetrade the
commerce of England has increased
21 per cent, in' 10 years. Under Pro-
tection the commerce of the United
States has increased 68 per cent, in
the same period, Holland 57 percent.,
Belgium 51 per cent., France 39 per
cent.
A Southern M.P. was lately

work of the session. An elector asked
him how it was he was away from
Parliament on one occasion for over
a wee£ “ Well,” said the M.P., “I
was detained by urgent business, and
I—er ” The elector rose. “What
kind of business?” he asked. “ Ob-

mered the M.P. “Now look here,
old boy,” said the questioner, “can
you tell me why you have so much
political business to transact at Mrs.
’s in street?” The member
subsided. Subsequently the elector
was asked how he came to know the
facts. “ It’s like this,” he said; “I
was with him all that week, and, by
, we had a real good time 1”

The WINDSOR MAGAZINE (Ward, Lock,

weak art and second-rate literature after the
model of the Strand, and the first number appears
to have very accurately gauged respectable English
middle-class taste and capacity. The preface
grovels in devotion to the respectable German
middle-class lady who squats on the English
1 ll ™ne, and pictures of royalty and alleged ansto-
craey are scattered with a liberal hand, ihe
editor claims that the Magazine bears no trace
of the leisurely trail of the tract (neat phrase);
but it is well slobbered with the sinister slime of
tie sycophant, ihe quantity of theWiNPSOR is
(like that of Queen Victoria) admirable.

A large Melb. drapery firm has announced
its intention of refusing employment to members
of women’s franchise leagues, and the various Yic.
leagues are very mad about it. It now remains
for a smart rival firm to declare in favor of the
leagues and scoop the knickerbocker trade.

There was a little mild excitement at
a Sydney tailor’s last week, when two “new
women” arrived to order a suit. The material
having been chosen, a cutter blandly came forward
with his tape-measure. They submitted to the
waist-measuring, but when it came to getting the
figures for the knickers, they asked, somewhat
confusedly, if there was not some arrangement—
er— by which the length of the arm would deter-
mine the size of the leg. On being assured that
there wasn’t, matters began to look serious, when
the proprietor suggested that if they stepped up to
the workroom a female employe would perform
the necessary tape-work. They seized the idea,
and left quite satisfied.

“It is the cheese” in Melbourne among
the gilded knickerbocker women to cycle forth
followed, at a distance of six paces, by a gorgeous
groom on a well-oiled bicycle. The New Woman,
when she is really “ New,” does not approve of a
bicycle built for two. For one thing, somebody
would have to be in front, and the New Woman
would, of course, allow no man precedence. And
if, on the contrary, the man were behind, he
would be- bound to notice that the New Woman
was usually not quite so new as she ought to be.
For it is into a woman’s throat and the back of
her neck that Time, the destroyer, first fastens his
remorseless t ;eth. A worn in’s face always tells
tales, but her neck !
* * *
Cycling is to be the medium for the exten-
sion of the breeches-idea among Melb. women,
who find it the most convenient method of justify-
ing their shedding of skirts.

It is expected that the great “M‘Meckan
will-case” will shortly be ended. The solicitor,
who has been residing in England for the past two
years on behalf of plaintiff (appeal having been
made to the Privy Council), has just returned to
Melbourne. The property, which was valued at
between <£150,000 and .£160,000 when Capt.
M'Meckan died, has much increased in value, not
a penny having been invested in bung banks or
i Mated property-values. The plaintiff, “Jack”
M‘Meckan, chief officer of the Monowai, is
engaged to a very charming South Yarra young
lady, the daughter of a well-known Victorian
engineer.
Very early the other morn-
ing, at Spencer-street station, a
suburban doctor’s wife tried her
hand at “New-Woman” tactics.
Half-an-hour earlier she had seen
her luggage aboard, and gone up
town for breakfast, returning (as
she thought, in time) for her up-
country train. But it was just
starting, and the porters shut the
gate, refusing to letler through
without a ticket. Nothing
daunted, hhe vaulted sheer over
the barrier, and took a bee-:'iine
for the guard’s-van, while hubby
gaped in astonishment outside in
the cold, and thanked the gods for
his noble wife. Unfortunately,
she was intercepted short of the
goal, and had to forego her trip,
for that day at all events.. The
fat fell in the fire when a red-tape
tyrant threatened to make her
leave the enclosure in the same
way as she had come in.
Which recalls the former prin-
cipal of a high-toned Melb. sec-
tarian college. Strolling in the
back garden, he occasionally
detected one or other of his young
lady pupils getting out of the
window of the music-room in
which she was supposed to be
practising. Upon these occasions
it was his custom to hasten to
the scene and request the culprit
to climb in again, which she had
to do while he stood coldly and
critically by.

The haunts of Justice have
much attraction for criminals.
Some men frequent the police-
court galleries daily, year in and
year out. It is the very circum-
stance of their constant attend-
ance which often gets them into
trouble. Case in pointCourt-
sergeant (loq.) : “That fellow’s
been here every Id ay for the last
six months, and he always annoys
me with his horrible grin. Must
bring him up under the vag.”
Next day the man figures in court
again—this time in the dock. Fact.
The Victorian Govt., which won’t take
money for the registration of the temples of Venus
(on the ground that —though that might lessen
disease —it would debase the State), hesitates not
to pocket the fines exacted with increasing regu-
larity from the wretched women of the town.
Every morning, at Melb. City Court, the number
of women charged as “ solicitors ” —for prostitutes
are of two kinds, legal and illegal—is equal to
that of the drunks, and in nearly every case a
fine of five shillings or more is exacted. Since the
beginning of the year one woman has been at the
bar no less than eight times, and the State has
received from her the average sum of six shillings
a week. Thus the State occupies the delectable
position of a pensioner upon the gains of prostitu-
tion.

Chief Secretary Bruuker’s readjustment of
N.S.W. police travelling expenses saves, taking a
batch at a time, 2s. in the <£, and, besides, pro-
portions more reasonably than heretofore the
relations of man toman. Under the old scheme,
a travelling superintendent was supposed to spend
£1 per day, whereas a travelling constable was cut
down to 4s. There is no part of the Australian
bush where diversities of table and lodging are
such as to take in two men together at these
figures, and as superintendents generally travel
with a couple of men, either the superintendent
pocketed half his allowance or the constables had
to sleep behind a log. Fifteen shillings for a
super, and ss. for a constable (Brunker’s scheme)
will probably work out thus : —Superintendent:
3 meals and bed, 10s., wine, 55.; Bobby ; 3 meals
and bed, 45., beer, Is.

The fair in connection with St. Pat.’s
(Melb.) Cathedral Fund will re-open at the
Exhibition next month, ostensibly to draw the
art-union. As the lottery has been open for some
months, and the supply of tickets is unlimited,
the chances are something like 3,000,000 to one
against the winner, who will probably turn out to
be a Chinaman or, worse still, an Orangeman.

Of late The Bulletin has taken to think-
ing again of Matthew D.ivies and his insolvency
release which was granted by Chief Justice Mad-
den, and his utter impecuniosity when he had
to defend himself in the Police-court because he
couldn’t afford to pay barristers, and his little
Masonic dinner whereat he spoke of re-attaining
“the top of the tree,” and of the people who put
money into his banks ; also, of many other things
relating to the Davies scandal. The subject has
acquired new social interest.

Nurseryman Gelding (N.S.W.) explains
the permanence of the cabbagee Chinaman thus :
“ We have been unable to get rid of the Chinese
market-gardener, simply because women prefer a
Chinaman’s ‘twiddle-twaddle’ to making their
purchases in a business-like way with European
vendors.” There is a hatful of truth in this.
The average woman likes the Chow’s eternal,
meaningless, “childlike and bland ” smile ; likes
the patience and “no-savee” with which he pos-
sesses his Oriental soul; likes the chaffing he
stands imperturbably; likes to call him “John,’’
and even to refer to him among her friends as
“My John;” likes to haggle over a peck of
potatoes and to fancy that John gives in to
her superior huckstering ability; and likes the
“Chinese nuts,” and the stray banana that he
gives to the children ; and regularly accepts the
preserved ginger that he leaves as a Christmas-
box. Ugh ! Woman is at the bottom of the
Chinese agony in Australia. Will the “New
Woman ” mend this evil ?

The Australienne, having got her medical
diploma, thought she would like to settle into a
practice at Darmstadt. The society was delicious,
but her resources ran low, and she felt that some
bold stroke was needed for an advt. Luckily
Prince D., the Russian, came there, and Cast eyes
upon her. He was a w’retched little weed, in the
lowest of health, troubled by insomnia, when she
met him. By professional hypnotism, learnt of Dr.
Charcot, she gave him sleep, and he thus picked
up health amazingly. Then he proposed marriage
to her, but got a nasty knock. She sent him a
receipt for all her fees, and then there appeared
a minute account of the case in the newspaper,
redounding to her credit, but making him look
rather small.

In the Melb. Photographic Exhibition is a
photogravure of a French painting, representing
a roguish-looking and very pretty girl reclining on
a couch, her cheek resting on her hand, and her
eyes twinkling with an unmistakeable fire. The
artist, in accordance with the passion expressed in
his work, fitted it like a glove with the title,
“Temptation,” but the pious Melb. firm which
exhibits the picture has taken upon itself to
ilowdlerise this into “Reverie,” which it certainly
is not. The Yankee Sehoolmarm who put pants
on the piano isn’t in it with some of the Southern
saints.
But the amateur photo, fiends, on the other
hand, are mostly' godless youths, and among the
exhibits of a certain newspaper of photographs
sent in for its competitions is the picture of a
young lady, “mid nodings on,” reclining on the
mossy turf at the foot of a cluster of tree-ferns.
The girl is pretty and shapely, but her pose is so
poorly conceived and ill-arranged that she only
remains as a subject for Social Gimletists to
indicate for the operation of the flogging clauses
of the Crimes Act.
Regarding the same photo., or one of similar
character, a yarn is told. The artist chose the
model from a number of professional applicants,
and accompanied by her and his faithful camera
made for a picturesqueand unfrequented dell out by
Fern Tree Gully, which he had had in his eye for
some time. On arriving there the lady was placed
in position, and was just being focussed properly,
when a crackling of twigs caused the photographer
to remove his head from the velvet cloth. An
aged man in a belltopper and shirt-sleeves was
approaching with a billy in his hand, and, as there
seemed no way of turning the intruder back, the
artist approached him and made a clean breast.
“ Look here, mister, I’m taking a photo, of a girl
behind those ferns, but I don’t want to be dis-
turbed, so I’ll be obliged if you say nothing.”
“Me !” replied the venerable one; “not me say
anything. But I’ll stop ’n have a look.” And he
followed the man of collodion into the bower, of
Venus. Regarding the divinity for a space of
five seconds, he seated himself on his upturned
billy and remarked, “Well, I’m an ole man and
I’ve lived some years, but bless me if this ain’t
the best picter I ever see in my life.”

Hobart Exhibition is just now an excellent
place to sleep in, the visitors being exceedingly
few. Day after day the only sounds are the band
playing to the audience of itself, and the fat voice
of the peddler who trades in grease-extractor and
indelible pencils. The Victorian Court and British
Art Gallery are the show, and as most visitors
have no lasting admiration for English art or
Yarraville-rnade boilers, the result is not so
colossal as prophet Joubert said it would be.
Also, the visitor is unable to see the alleged views
from the dome, by reason of the cafe-bar towels
drying thereon. Altogether ’tis a sweet pro-
menade of deadbeats, cheap barmaids, and year-
old whisky.
The sensational Westralian unnatural-
offence case, in which the accused is a newly-
arrived scion of a well-known English family, and
closely related to a somewhat prominent poli-
tician, concluded most abruptly in the discharge
of the prisoner owing to the Bench refusing the
application for a third remand. The popular
impression is that had the defendant been a
laborer the police could have had 40 remands to
round-up their witnesses.
At a Sydney China-
man’s funeral, the other day,
deceased’s friends, wishing
to conduct the obsequies with
all due pomp and ceremony,
engaged a fife - and - drum
band. The latter, unac-
quainted with any dead-
march, substituted “ Home,
Sweet Home ’’ as the dole-
fidlest ditty in their reper-
toire. The sorrowing caval-
cade kept solemn step and
noticed nothing wrong. Then
the instrumentalists got tired
of their theme and struck
boldly into “Two Little
Girls in Blue,” and de-
ceased’s friends quickened
their steps a little and shook
hands with themselves over
the versatility of their band.

If women are going to
take to wearing knicker-
bockers as a general rule,
much leg-padding will have
to be used. Thus Lady Cohn
Campbell, prompted by see-
ing a ladies’ gymnastic dis-
play in London:—“lt is
rather sad to have to record
that in all the band of girls
there is not one good pair of
legs. There are long girls
with legs like cedar pencils ;
there are short ones with
legs like those of a dachs-
hund ; there are legs with
the calves slipped down to
the ankles; and there are
legs without any calves at
all. But among those nine-
teen or twenty girls, fpicked
at random, there is not one
pair of legs which could be
even termed promising in
shape.”

A story of family jars was brought to a
successful ending recently by the suicide, in a
suburban park, of an elderly lady, the principal
character in the story. Her husband had died
intestate just previously, leaving <£00,000; one-
third of which, in accordance with the law, went
to the widow, and the remainder to the next-of-
kin—two nieces, cordially disliked by the old lady.
This so preyed upon her that she eventually lost
her reason, and one morning early she went out
into the park and suicided. The strange sequel
is that, as the vitriolic old dame herself died with-
out leaving a will, the whole of her money also
goes to the enrichment of the two nieces.

ment to clcse at six on Saturday nights, are
urging the Early Closing Association to agitate
for an Act to compel all shop-keepers to shut up
at the time named, and they even subscribe <£lo
10s. to a fund to be used in preliminary work with
this object.
« « «
Adelaide drapers, who have conceded
Saturday night closing to their assistants, com-
plain that their employes, when they leave to
start businesses on their own account, in city or
suburbs, almost invariably keep open for hours
later than the shops with which they are com-
peting. An ex-treasurer of the Early Closing
Association is one of the most inveterate sinners
in this respect, his establishment, which is in the
principal street, being in full swing until 10 or 11
o’clock. Almost the whole of its trade after
6 p.rn. is, sad to relate, drawn from mechanics,
laborers and their wives.

A certain S.A. country solicitor lately
advised a client that he had a first-class case,
and certain expensive proceedings were started
accordingly. A little later he found that his read-
ing of the law was erroneous, and the client reluc-
tantly agreed to compromise and pay a heavy bill
for law charges. He gave his cheque to the
solicitor, and the solicitor gave his own cheque to the
legal opponent. But just then the client’s banker
sent him an intimation that the bank had stopped
his overdraft as it couldn’t see its way to find
money to be wasted in law, and the cheque was
dishonoured. The lawyer’s banker, on getting
back the document, stopped payment of the
lawyer’s own cheque. Then the holder sued the
lawyer for the amount, and the distracted lawyer
sued his client, and the client threatens to sue him
on the ground that his erroneous advice had been
the direct cause of the stoppage of his credit,
and had brought him to ruin. The Bulletin’s
opinion is that it is a pity this sort of thing doesn’t
happen a good deal oftener.

In these days of competition and low fares
the company on the Maoriland steamers gets
more and more mixed. On a recent excursion to
the West Coast Sounds, the high-toned crowd in
the saloon included 19 spielers and seven painted

Dear Bulletin,
—Re that Sydney
model suburb anti-
license deputation.
The goodies wilfully
mislead Minister
Gould, himself a bit
afflicted with goodi-
ness. I was in court
when the license was
granted, and here is
what occurred : A
petition from 52
model suburbanites
favored the applica-
tion, and a police-in-
spector who, on his
own showing, “ had
a personal interest in
the case,” had 11
witnesses at hand to
uphold his objection.
The magistrates’ duty
clearly was to consult
the wishes of the
majority. If anyone
was dictatorial it was
the police-inspector,
who reckoned on boss-
ing a bench of six
paid magistrates. I
do not love Stipendi-
ary Addison, but I
admire frankness.—

When the sister of Chief Secretary Gordon
was appointed overseer of night-nurses at Adelaide
Hospital, a senior nurse, possessing all the needful
qualifications, was passed over by the Board on
the sole ground that she had once been a domestic
servant. 44 How could we take instructions from
her?” haughtily asked a probationer, the daughter
of an influential doctor. “Why, she was once a
servant in our house ! ”

It is definitely known in Adelaide that the
British Government intends to appoint a successor
to Lord Kin tore at the end of April, when his
term of office expires. Mr. Way’s reign as Lieut.-
Gov. will therefore only last about three months.
The Advertiser’s London correspondent (who
first informed Australia of the probable appoint-
ment of Lord Brassey to Victoria) affirms that the
S.A. vacancy will be filled by Mr. R. C. Munro-
Ferguson, M.P. for Leith, a junior member of the
Rosebery Ministry, and a son-in-law of the Mar-
quis of Dufferin, Ambassador to France.

In Adelaide they are prosecuting the
“Madams” and “Professors.” By the way,
people are asking how it was that those who had
no friends were arrested on warrant and landed in
gaol, whilst the fashionable chemist was “ sum-
moned,” thus obviating arrest and subsequent
bail ?
# • *
Alan Fergusson, sou of Sir James of that
ilk, who h now doing 12 months in gaol for setting
fire to the school where he was supposed to be
educated, is said to be a victim of football.
He was a weakly and timid, but reasonably clever,
lad, and was a successful student in his pre-foot-
Iball period. Football was compulsory at Glenal-
rmond, on the beautifully British idea that a feeble
youth could be rendered physically strong by being
1 bashed around in a “ scrum,” and this unlucky
weakling took a hand in the game against his will,
■and w T as knocked insensible almost as a matter of
'course. Thereafter he became an erratic semi-
lunatic who was incapable of learning anything,
and who muttered to himself and saw visions.
A cheerful sermon on Nebuchadnezzar’s fiery
furnace is said to have finally sent him off the
small remains of his head, and he joyously set the
college on fire—after informing some of his school-
fellows of his intention—by way of having a
Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace of his own. Result, as
aforesaid, 12 months in gaol to recuperate his
shattered intelligence.

THE WORM TURNS.
THE THORN IN HIS FLESH : “ You miserable worm! Drink, I say,
Drink, with a capital D, is the cause of all your troubles.”
The Worm: “Alas! it’s too true. The only time that I was ever
drunk was when I asked you to marry me, and I got drunk
then (ass that I was) to screw up my courage ! ”
There is an honorable rivalry between
Melbourne and Sydney. Melbourne achieves a
charcoal-pan-suffocation horror, in which a poor,
starved, middle-aged woman murders her mother
and kills herself ; then Sydney effervesces with an
alleged double-murder attempt of a unique sort.
The Melbourne tragedy was after the French pat-
tern ; the alleged attempted Sydney crime was in
the Italian style. A money-lender is accused of
having wanted to hire a horse-trainer to sand bag
an 18-year-old girl and throw her into a waterhole,
after which he was to assassinate her elderly male
quasi-guardian according to any convenient
method that might present itself. By these deaths
the usurer, it is averred, expected to make several
hundreds of pounds and to be able to afford his
hired bravo enough to buy a partnership in a
condiment-making business. Gruesome humor !
First cold-meat, then condiment-making !

Most of the crew of the Rocokino, the

This world is a cold place for the woman
of uncertain age who is thrown out on it
to earn her own livelihood. The latest and
most pathetic of Melbourne suicides is a new
evidence of this very old truism. The
people involved were a mother and daughter
-«■? »',<* v vin * d i e H rr ‘ iraB
previously. They had been entitled to some
money from some source or other, but a bank
intercepted and reconstructed.it. The daughter
made a humble living as a music-teacher until the
people of Melbourne grew so hard-up that no one
. , . , . , riii .1 i.
wanted to learn music any longer. 1 hen they got
a loan from Oohenstem on the security ot
their furniture. Cohenstein, so far as appears
from the evidence, was tolerably forbearing,
but at last he announced his intention of
seizing the sticks, “including an old-fashioned
~ r i-i ii j -i i t L„
piano, for his long-delayed monish. Then the
mother and daughter got some small assistance
from a society for the aid of decayed gentlewomen
and tried to earn a living by such hopeless devices
as making lollies for sale in the market. Finally
a gruesome stench issuing from the house attracted
ii- .. .. , ~ . . , . _
public attention, and the door being burst open a
dreadfully decomposed old woman was found in a
chair, with the other decayed gentlewoman, her
daughter, lying on the floor beside her.
......
A pathetically-written letter set forth that they
proposed to commit suicide by charcoal fumes,
but the post-mortem showed that the mother had
died from unknown causes and been a grisly relic
, . ~ ■ c i j T c „„
about the premises for several days before her
daughter’s decease. The only redeeming feature
about the affair was that they were botli really
and hopelessly dead; had it been possible to
resuscitate them a large, well-fed magistrate
would probably have lectured them severely
j K i , i f r i • i f
and then sent them to gaol_ for a fortnight.
When the law finds a dead suicide it charitably
decides that she died while in a state of “ tempor-
ary derangementif it bursts in the door before
she is quite dead it holds that she made a criminal
attempt to do away with herself while in full
• c i J i . . i i • i
possession of her senses, and treats her accordingly.
I he question of sanity or insanity isn t a matter
of medical evidence ; it depends wholly on what
time the large, bumble-footed policeman happens

wise, the writer isn’t a Chinaman. He is a civil

“no man could be as great a statesman as Patterson
looks.” You deny it on the ground that you saw him
affably consuming oysters and sharing a bottle of stout

he, that he takes deep interest in the development of the

Anon: Will consider T. Cooper: (1) In some parts
of Essex, as The Bulletin said, you can get farms just
now without rent, merely that the owner may escape
paying taxes on an unproductive property ; this on the
authority of a Board of Trade report. Therefore, the
landlord doesn’t come into the question. (2) The place is
within cartage distance of London, so the railway freight
doesn’t come in. (3) England is a Freetrade country in
agriculture. (4) You say “no English districts can arrive
at Single-tax conditions until taxes are abolished.” Well,
if there is to be a Single-tax how can taxes he abolished?
H.A.L.: Well written, but the story of the substituted
Chinaman has been told in many shapes already...

My Dear Moorabinda—
The many and alluring advts. thrown out by
the matrimonial agencies which find you bride,
bell, book, and candle for half-a-crown, strictly in
advance, evidently don’t carry into the back-
blocks, or else a Govt. Labor Bureau wouldn’t
have raised the following peremptory demand,
which I copy verbatim :
Kindly forward me at once, to Blank Town, a woman, not
over 25:yeans, must be good-looking, a good housekeeper and
a good cook. If she suits me on arrival 1 will make her
ray wife. She must be healthy, as lam myself very
wrong and hearty. You will oblige me very much by
attending to this matter.
“Kindly forward at once ”is excellent. Romeo
himself couldn’t be in a greater hurry to clasp his
Juliet than is the Blank Town bachelor to hand
over his hearth and home to the keeping of % per-
fectly strange woman, though the most grisly part
of the affair lies in his sending his sharp order for
one wife, carriage paid, to a Labor Bureau!
Meanwhile, the astonished Department has serious
thoughts of laying in a few of the latest patterns
in brides.
Mayoress Lees—Sydney’s just-fledged Civic
Potentatess—made her debut at Sydney Town
Hall the other day, when a hurtling mob attended
liwr first reception, despite the fact that the
weather had got its goloshes on. I sincerely
trust, by the. way, that the new people aren’t
going to be Mother Carey’s chickens, like the
Burdekins, whose festive fixtures were always the
cue for deluges. Fortunately, there never is
weather of any sort under shelter, so the big hall,
clothed, as in a wedding garment, with palms,
flags and ferns, looked its very boskiest, and, if
Wiegand (at the organ) had hired somebody to
sit on the soft stop, there wouldn’t have been a
flaw anywhere. If the same unmuzzled roar of
melody is to obtain at subsequent civic
people had better learn to talk on their fingers, or
fill their pockets with conversation-lollies.
From a picturesque point of view, the new
Mayor and Mayoress are quite satisfactory. Mrs.
Lees—a small, amiable-looking Mayoress, with an
airy manner—received the heaviest throng, which
sided, ambled, trotted and bolted in, each after
his kind (why do people look all hands and feet
at such times?) as if it was individually her
dearest friend ; and wore the harmonious colors of
the rosy cockatoo, with a small, becoming bonnet
and a shower posy of pink roses. The very latest
out in Mayors—a fair-haired, pleasant-spoken Mr.
Mayor, be it said —sported the “ vermin
trimmed robes which seem to have the unhappy
knack of fitting each potentate as badly as they
did his predecessor, and the mayoral connubial
trophies, as one might say, were staged as usual
within the silken ropes with plenty of gape-seed
growing around. Miss Lees, a fair-haired and
fresh-looking damsel, wore a cream fichu topped
off by a pretty perishable sort of hat, and her
younger sister was similarly arrayed. Altogether
the mayoral party made a very pleasant group,
and maintained its composure admirably under
the rude and basilisk stare of a seore or so of per-
sons who drew their cha : rs up opposite and glared
goggle-eyed like so many hypnotists.
One of the best-dressed women at the reception
was a “ military ” matron, who cut a very taking
figure indeed in a black mirror silk elegantly
picked out with butter-color lace, a small bonnet,
and her fair hair d la Cadogan ; but the dressing
was very good on the whole, considering the
weather and the fact that Tom, Dick, and
Harry were all there. The oddest spectacle
was afforded by two young women in bright
yellow dresses, who stood up against the buffet
with their skirts turned up, linings-out, as if for a
washing bout, so that no foundered cups of tea
should spoil their garish beauties, but it made
them look as if they were wading in refreshments,
which possibly, was the case. Another unusual
spectacle was afforded by a not exactly sylph-like
he-mm-i lian plaintively asking a lady to pinch him
round the waist and tell him if his corsets were
too tight. It seems that he takes 52 inches, but
only after a great strain on his stay-laces, and he
seemed so anxious, to get her experienced opinion
as to whether he girded or not! Man really has a
frivolous soul —he would like frills round his
knickers only he has the monkey cunning to con-
ceal his vanities. For instance, I have heard of a
Sydney youth who wears stays, and simply won’t
look at them unless they are made of rainbow
coutille !
There was a most unseemly mob round the visi-
tors’-b®ok at the Mayoral Reception people
elbowing and pushing and scrunching to write
their names in order to get invited to all the civic
outbreaks that may hap. There was even—
mirabile dictu! —a more desperate struggle round
the pan and ink than around the cakes and ale—
this because pen and ink in the present meant
eakejs and ale in the future. Though, let me
remark, there wasn’t any real ala Like one of
Ids predecessors. Mayor Lees never looks upon the
wine, nor does he put temptation in the way of
his guests. A clear-headed rbgimeof milk and soda
has arrived in the marble halls that are “ taken but
surrendered.” But I have no doubt the incorrupt-
ible Town Hall youths will still keep fiery spirits
behind the almanac in the bad old style.
Talking about those stupid things, visitors
books, which are only placed in the halls of the
Great to give a literary finish to the scenery and
keep the haberdasher in affluence owing to ink-
spots on your gloves, there is a new fashion in
vogue at Admiralty House. When a person goes
to sign his name in the book the private-secretary
is always in the room—so that he will know at
least one member of the family when cards go out
for a State ball, I suppose. But this little extra
formality has frightened away a number of people
who would gaily fioek in when it was only a
question of facing a flunkey or two, and it has
also the much-desired effect of “ putting the skid
on ” the obliging friend who amiably signs not
only for herself and family but for sisters, cousins
and aunts as well, making quite a literary achieve-
ment of it. Under the calm gaze of the private
sec. a man (or woman) hardly feels equal to in-
scribing a full page of names and addresses. He
only longs to put “John Smith, his x mark,” and
flee into the outer air.
Bland Holt’s mascotte drama, “Span of Life,”
at Sydney Royal, well stands seeing a second
time, the only monotonous thing about going twice
being that the rush for seats was exactly the same
as at first. But it is a soothing thing to walk
into a playhouse clothed and in one’s right mind
(hats allowed in the circle), and men especially
bless the ukase that absolves them from shiny
shirt fronts at 8 p.m. I detected no real changes
in the “ Span ” after a seven weeks’run. Hilda
Spong’s rings seem a little more numerous (Hilda
dotes on jewellery), and sprightly Mrs. Holt plays
Shrove_ with even more relish than at first, but
otherwise the brilliant spectacle appears as
it did in the days of its youth. It is getting a
middle-aged spectacle now, and the only fear that
haunts the ever-popnlar Bland Holt is that the
expensive camel will die of old age on the premises
before he can get what sporting men call a pull on
the play. If ever a drama bolted with a manager,
“ The Span of Life ’’ haabolted with Bland Holt.
People who encourage brotherly love to con-
tinue between Church and Stage ought to be
delighted with the latest phase of that sort of
thing observable in the tight little island. Kowal-
ski and “Pussy” Poussard, when in Tas., gave
a very thinly-attended concert, somewhere or
other, and a day or so afterwards met the local
Father O Flynn (also a newspaper-editor, be it
said), to whom they confided their little trouble.
Hisßeverenceheard all aboutthe “beggarlyarray;’’
but, to their astonishment, instead of deploring
the want of culchaw in his particular dirt-heap
and passing the artists on to the next stopping-
place, he earnestly advised them to give a sacred
concert the following Sunday night.
They obediently announced a sacred concert,
and, on the same Sabbath eve, Father O’EJynn
stood up—at the end of his service—and advised
his congregation to go at once and hear the two
great artists round the corner. “It reflected little
credit on the community,” he remarked, “that
such refined and ennobling music had so far met
with such scant patronage. Music elevated the
soul of man, and producing it and listening
to it were equally an act of religious devotion.”
He advised them all to go round at once and
attend the concert, which would not occupy more
than an hour and a half. And they did go as one
individual, until the room was S. R. O.
That is probably the most promising start ever
taken by the lukewarm Church and Stage Guild.
Soon we will have clerics—when the collection
gets shy—boldly announcing from the pulpit that
“ Brother Snap—one of the finest actors it has
pleased the Lord to prosper—is playing Hamlet
even now, my dearly beloved brethren, only four
doors round the corner. And oh ! those among
3'ou who have neglected to see the wonders of
Nature, as displayed by that pure-minded maiden,
Miss Flossie Fewclothes, thereby withhold your
admiration from one of the noblest works of the
Almighty ! ” One can see it all coming. How
Brutus Snap will get even for the advt. by dress-
ing the supes. up in silk hats and quaker bonnets
and sending them to listen, open-mouthed with ad-
miration, to the parson s discourse, putting silver
in the plate meanwhile.
A distinctly amusing incident transpired at a
Sydney post-office the other day, when a cheerful
old lady came in and asked if there were any
letters for Mrs. Asterisk? Two were forthcoming.
“ And now, are there any for Mrs. Dash?” Mrs,
Dash panned out one. “ Now, please, see if there
are any for Mrs. Blank?” But the clerk jibbed
at that. “ All these people ought to apply for
their own letters, madam,” he said, in his best
official manner. “I really cannot—” but the old
lady cut him short with “Well, and ain’t they
applyin’ ? You see, I’ve been married three times,
young man, and I never know what name they’ll
send to !”
I have just heard about a rich society leader
who gave the following reply to an unfortunate
relative who had written to her asking for the loan
of one or two pounds to pay the funeral expenses
of a dead infant. “ I will not lend you the money,
as I consider it wilful waste. What you should
do is to make a box and bury the child in the gar-
den." What a magnificent baby-farmer was lost
to the world when that woman’s parents struck
it rich !
“ My attention has been drawn ” to a statement
in a Melbourne paper which cr.etiits me with having
a book on the stocks, and thereby making the
third (Third ! when every Austral Salonite is
raking Hfeaven and earth for people and ideas to
go into her seven-leagued story !) Australian jour-
naliste about to seek fame as a novelist. As it
happens, I haven’t the faintest idea of doing any
such thing. The fame that has so far rewarded
the Australian pen-lady, when she sandwiches the
utterance of her bursting soul between paper
covers and charges 2s. fid. for the result with a
heroic disdain of the fatal “thripenny baskets”
outside the booksellers, does not encourage
one to go and do likewise. Most lady-
journalist literature reminds one of the good
old editor to whom a poet offered his burning soul
on the half-shell, as it were. “No,” said the wise
old man, “ I would neither publish nor pay for it
—but our publishers will do you a very nice
volume in the style of the language of flowers for
a nominal sum if you really must appear in
print.”
The latest Sydney fad is to carry poor pussy
round the block. Travellers to Manly, the other
day, were greatly amused by the appearance of a
lady dressed in white with a blue sash and carry-
ing a large white Thomas cat with a blue eollar.
Whenever I see a woman aggressively hugging in
public a dumb animal that can’t hit back I
always wonder why she doesn’t start a nursery
and let her feelings loose on the human race?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
George Giffen has made little out of cricket.
He has been in Adelaide G. P.O. for over 15 years, and is
now getting £lBO a year, whilst officials who joined the
department years after he did have been promoted over
his head. Giffen would, by this time, have earned a com-
petency had he been in England. Look at Grace, Walter
Reed {amateurs), and all the leading professionals.
• ♦ * *
When a N.S.W. Ministerial party was flying
around Wyalong, right in the middle of the worst part of
a track which seemed to run from nowhere to nowhere,
without a house or tent in sight, in the very bareness of
desolation, a gaunt, briek-oomplexioned, scarecrow of a
man suddenly shot into sight—also from nowhere—and
said : “Svy, mister, how many did George Giffen make in
the larst test-match ? ”
» • ♦ *
The Adelaide Oval wickets, “ the finest in the
world,” were prepared by Jesse Hide, the Sussex pro ,
who came out under engagement for five years to S. A.O.A.
Hide used to prospect the Adelaide ranges for likely soil,
and many soils were tried before he was satisfied. Adel-
aide wickets are wonderfully durable, although they
quickly cut up after bad weather. After S. A. had defeated
England the wicket was almost perfect, although over
1200 runs had been scored on it. Oheokett, the present
curator, was with Hide for years before he left again for
England to play for Sussex.
♦ « » •
Inasmuch as the final test-match in Melbourne
will clash somewhat with the V.R.O. Autumn Meeting it
is suggested that the M.C.C. ought to change their dates.
But. the cricket will'bring a lot of visitors to Melbourne,
and most of these will “do ” the races on the two last
days of the meeting under any circumstances. More-
over, the match is not unlikely to be finished by the Tues-
day, when the Australian Cup comes off.
* ♦ ♦ *
None of the Englishmen brought less than six
bats to Australia for the tour.
• » * »
The Sunday break in cricket matches, which is
the result of gate-money arrangements, leads to a lot of
“playing for the weather.” Such great changes may
come o’er the spirit of a wicket between Saturday and
Monday, that a captain winning the toss on Friday seems
bound to think of how he would like the game to stand
three days later, if there is to be rain in the meantime.
When Stoddart sent the Australians in to bat, the other
Friday, he was presumably reckoning that they would be
nearly through their second innings by Monday, when his
own men would have a fair go apiece under improved
batting conditions.
* ♦ » •
The Englishmen just about lost the last Sydney
match by missing the early chances to catch Graham.
They might possibly have topped the Australians’ first
innings on the Friday, but they didn’t. That is a fair
answer to the complaint that Australia had all thfe luck in
getting first innings after losing the toss.
* » » »
Only one English Eleven (Lord Sheffield’s) has
been beaten on the M. 0.0. ground in the last eleven years.
If Stoddart and Co. can prime their hearts with this
encouraging fact they may win the rubber. But it begins
to look as though the Australian fielding, trying weather,
and injudicious beer - drinking, have combined to
demoralise the Britishers.
* * • »
B. B. Cooper, who used to play with the Melb.
Cricket Club, came from England, with his peculiar leg-
stroke, much imitated. He had a knack of lifting his leg.
Better than some Englishmen’s knack of lifting their
little finger.
• * * ♦
The veteran Longmore, M.P., fulminates against
Vie. cricket enthusiasm at a time when the country is in
such sore straits. Lotigraore seems unaware that A. E.
Trott has clean bowled the depression.
* * * *
The sting of the Australian Eleven at Adelaide
and Sydney was in its tail. There is no sting, and only
an occasional display of stamina, in the Englishmen’s tail.
• * ♦ ♦
Leaving out of account his “double century*
score against Victoria, the Lancashire amateur, Maclaren,
has been one of the failures of the English team. Nothing
great was expected of Humphreys, Gay, Ford and
Fhillipson on their English form, and the two wicket-
keepers have done themselves justice. Brockwell and
Richardson are disappointments rather than failures.
♦ * * *
The Englishmen freely admit that the first test-
match was won for them by the wicket; but they point
out that in the second test-match they had the worst of
the wicket, and they won. In the third they had the
worst of the wicket, but A. E. Trott bowled splendidly
and they played badly. The fourth test-match they say
they deserved to lose because of the catches they dropped
in the Australians’ first innings, and they claim that then,
too, they had by far the worst of the wicket. The Eng-
lishmen say that although their downfall was due to the
wicket, the Australian bowlers did more upon it than
their bowlers could have done.
* * * *
In the interprovincial match, N.S.W. v. Queens-
land, three of the Queensland wickets fell in the first
innings for 93 ; the remaining seven put on only 13.
M‘Kibben got five wickets for 19 ; Iredale, three for 1.
When, ten years ago, Iredale first played senior cricket
in Sydney, he used to bowl for the now extinct Albert
Club. The Alberts just about that time were a good
club ; their crack bowler was S. W. Kirke, who has bowled
well this season for the Amiidale eighteen against the
Englishmen. Kirke promised to develop into an inter-
provincial howler, but nine years ago the Sydney Survey
Department, of which he is an officer, sent him up
country. He has been up-country ever since, and is now
one of the chiefs of Armidale office.

Last week the N.S.W. Railway-Commissioners
gave the English team of cricketers, and a few Sydneyites,
who are in no way identified with the game, a picnic at
the Hawkesbury River, but, strange to say, members of
the Australian representative team were “not in it.”
Eddy naturally “cottons” to his countrymen, but
“Charley” Oliver, himself an old interprovincial man,
might well have stuck out for the inclusion of Ms little lot.
It was a “ slap-up ” affair, the lee-scuppers fairly running
with “ fizz,” the cost of which, no doubt, came but of the
privy purse of the Commissioners ; but they do not own
the engine, or the palace dining-car, or the army of
waiters, and outsiders are fools enough to think that Aus-
tralians might now and then, on their own railways, come
in for some of the good things which invariably fall to the
lot of the “blasted Britisher.”
There is much discussion going l on as to who is
to fill Moses’place in the final teshmitch, as it is pre-
Burned that he will not be picked again. The choice
appears to He between C. MoLeod and Sid Callaway.
Eady, the tall Tasmanian, who twice topped the hundred
against Victoria, is also spoken of. He, however, has had
no chance of playing against really good bowling ; where-
as both McLeod and Callaway have performed creditably
against the English bowling, besides being in fine bowling
form themselves.

Batsman Lyons ; “ My luck’s clean out this
season ; I couldn’t keep my wickets up in the test-
matches—and, hang me, I was trying to hold an umbrella
over the head of a lady in Market-street, the other even-
mg, and the wind turned it outside-in !”
* * * »
When the next Australian team visits England
Richardson promises them a w arm time. “ I'd like to
bowl at the Australians on an English wicket.”
* * * *
Two or three of the Englishmen did not expect
the total to be more than 75 each innings in the test-
match, This was Moses’ opinion too.
♦ » * *
The Englishmen deny that in the first test-
match they batted like wooden dolls. Richardson says
that the w ieket was the worst he ever played on ; more-
over, that an English cricketer doesn’t know what a
sticky wicket means until he visits Australia.
* * » »
Richardson (this is his first visit to Australia)
says that the only remarkable feature of Australian
cricket is the fielding. It is here that the English are at
such a marked disadvantage. “ The Aiistialians all field
well ; and even the country teams field better than we do.
Look at the catches we missed off Graham.”

The Sydney ground is considered by the Eng-
lishmen to be the best fielding ground in the world.

The national game of football in Victoria. At
the end of last season a leading supporter of the dark
blues (Carlton) exclaimed with tears in his eyes, ‘ How
the devil could you expect them to kick goals? The poor
wretches had no boots, and we (the club) had no money
to buy them. The men who used to stand to the lads
have gone over to the Premiers.”

The Fijian cricketers touring in Maoriland
lost their first match at Auckland by an innings and 152
runs. Apropos of this, the Samoans are enthusiastic
cricketers. They play 70 a-side and an average inni gg
lasts a fortnight. Some years ago the Samoan King
Malietoa was reckoned a crack wicket-keeper.

Moses were denied the prefix.

Vanitas, Malolo, Ganmain, J 5, Eortunatus,
Erl King, and Bradford have all been supported for the
Newmarket Handicap, but how seldom do early fancies
win big events? Gaillardia has not as yet been mentioned
in the betting. She is in the same stable as Malolo and
Tullamore, and if she satisfies the astute Ike Foulsham
she should nearly win, as last year she was very unlucky
to tumble up against two such smashers as Hova and
Bruin.
* • * *
Churchill (Bst. 41b.) in ’9O, and Wild Rose (Bst.
lib.) in ’92, won the Newmarket Handicap, each of them
being by Newminster out of Primrose. Eureka, an own
brother to these two sprinters, is this year weighted with
Sst. 21b., and that he is fleet of foot may be gathered from
the fact of his winning the Lawn Handicap (six furlongs)
at Fleming ton in July, ’93; since that time he has been
“resting.” Hs is now well, and will in all probability
represent the pow erful St. Albans stable.

A fair contingent has left N.S. Wales for Vic-
toria, and a few “laurels” should be brought back.
Donation is very well, and if one of the big prizes is to be
landed ’twill be by his agency. Oumberoona should be
handy in the hurdle events.

Mr. Gollan’s luck is beginning to turn, and with
Bessie M-Carthy and Stemohaser he may be expected to
bid highly for some of the V.R.O. plums. Sternchaser
can stay, as evidenced by his good second to Portsea two
years ago, and as he is well served in the weights his
chance must be held in great respect for the Australian
Cup.
* * * «
The Harvester is being backed at an absurdly
short price for the Australian Cup. As probably he will
have to succumb toCobbity in the St. Leger he cannot be
expected to give him 41bs. over a half-a-mile longer
course. Preston ran very well in Melb. Cup, and with
but 7st. Sibs. on his back he should beat all the three-
year-olds.

If the Newmarket Handicap is to go to any of
the top-weights nothing seems more likely than Whaka-
watea—9st. 9lbs. This is no great load for a horse who,
as a two-year old, had an unbeaten record. The wily
Oarslake has Malolo in, and, as usual, the public has
blindly rushed to make him favorite, although he has
practically no performance to recommend him if we
except a certain five-furlong race once at Mentone.

These are not Calcutta camels —or, rather, those
that are known as such—but the real Hill breed ;
accustomed to feed on bushes and grass identical
with those of Western Australia; as only used by
the Army Commissariat Department of India,
consequently they can be thoroughly recom-
mended. They are dfreotly shipped from Kurra-
chee, the nearest seaport to Kharan, Baluchistan
and Afghanistan.
The s.s. Claverley, a first-class steamer-, giving
comfortable accommodation to 400 camels, was
chartered for the special purpose of bringing from
Kurraohee these 320 camels. All these earn els are
in good condition, as we have taken great trouble,
no expense having been spared by Messrs. D. and
J. Fowler on our behalf.

N. B.—As these camels are from a cool part of
the East, they will by the time they leave quaran-
tine be in magnificent condition. I insert this as
Indian camels are considered useless by some of
the judges in Coolgardie. This may apply to the
Calcutta camels, but cannot be taken as applying
to Kharan camels.

Australia is going to be made very weary of the
Carbine sale, we’re thinking. A Melb. paper says that
the higher prices paid for several English stallions “ are
not to"he compared with the legitimate sum paid by the
Duke of Portland for ‘Old Jack.’” For some unknown
reason a peculiar legitimacy attaches to the Carbine deal.
Carbine will find himself in unsociable company
at the Portland stud. St. Simon and some of the other
distinguished mashers are said to have vile tempers.
A Melb. Herald correspondent suggests that,
as Oaibine is going off, he should be placed on exhibition
for a few days at Is. admission, as, no doubt, thousands
will be anxious to see him.

“ The sale of Carbine to such a sportsman as
His Grace of Portland,” says the Argus, “is a splendid
advertisement for Australia.” Poor Australia! dragged
into fame at the heels of an entire 1
* * * *
Day stud-groom to Portland, has left England
and will accompany Carbine to his new home. It is safe
to bet that the first thing Day does to the noble brute
will be to bang his tail in real “ old Hmglish ’ style, to
match his own shaven upper lip, the badge of meniality
in that land of the free. If ever the writer sees a portrait
of Carbine in the English sporting papers with a ohopped-
off tail making him look like a heavy-rumped hack, he’ll
go straight “ Ome ” with the sole end and aim of murder-
ing the perpetrator of the horrid outrage.
St. Simon, Ayrshire, Donovan and Carbine,
now all belong to the lucky Duke of Portland.

There is some talk of increasing the Caulfield
Cup stake, which already stands at 2000 sovs. Better to

stewards were to get a much bigger crowd than they had
last year they wouldn’t be able to accommodate it

A few lucky ones at a recent Melb. Guvmentouse
function were treated to a gratis one-round contest with
the raw ’uns under the very portico of the hallowed
palace. As the carriages were departing at the conclusion
of the festivities ome of the lordly flunkeys, in an excess of
zeal, slammed the door of his vehicle on the ankle of the
youthful scion of a well-known sporting family, where-
upon the latter hopped out and dealt the offending one
“a slough,” almost in the presence of vice-royalty itself.
As there were no beefeaters or headsmen knocking about,
the profaner of the temple of loyalty was not dragged
away to a fearful doom, but was promptly plugged by.the
man in the plush pants. He responded by filling the
powdered-haired one’s eye, and for the next three minutes
the contending parties provided a “ real lively go.” At
length the guest landed a beautiful uppercut on the point
of the menial’s jaw, and sent Him out, amid the tears of
fashionable society. Whether the successful scrapper is
to be prosecuted for treason or not is not yet known.

What a farce—the rule which is supposed to
stop jockeys from betting 1 The lads have their own
especial punter who puts their little bit on their fancy.
On Saturday they picked on Olive for the Moorefleld
Stewards Mile, and a nice win they had at tens to one.
No rule can be framed which would stop jockeys
from betting, and it is a moot question whether it would
not be better to allow them to wager openly.

Apropos the 13,000 guineas given for Carbine,
the English record price, a few years ago, was £12,250 for
Blair Athol. Tneti Doncaster changed hands for £14,000,
though owner Saville was alleged to have refused £15,000
for Cremorne. Of late years these figures are put in the
•hade by the amounts given for Ormonde, St. Blatze,
Common, &e. It is said that £15,000 was offered and
refn-ed for Matchbox, second in last year’s Derby. The
appreciation of gold does not hold in the case.
A recent issue of the SKETCH has an excellent
likeness of Joe Thompson, who has kept his hair on
wonderfully and looks hearty. Joseph came out a
“skinner” with'his double on the Autumn Handicaps,
which is said to have f und vast favor with the English
magnates from Royalty downwards. Joe is credited with
some big wins. Rusticus’ Leicester Handicap is said to
have been worth £30,000 to him ; and £20,000 he is re-
ported to have bagged by Indian Queen’s win.

not having a Gould “gag,” it is presumed —“ leg-

was rotten and fell away, and Murphy walked off
to finish his drunk. Thereupon the police re-
arrested him, and charged him with stealing the

for trial for “ escaping.” Judge Coffey very per-

Jarvey 10s. with the fine, old wheeze—“So, after
all, my good man, you see honesty is the best

Ed. Bulletin, — Be N.S.W. Works Min-
ister Young’s son in the Govt, service. Your
informant has given you a crooked version of the
case. Young, jun., holds a temporary position in
no way connected with the Works. Having
given satisfaction to his superior officers he was
retained (still temporarily) when others were dis-
charged ; but the reason of his retention, as stated
by your correspondent, is untrue. Another thing:
Why do we hear so much of the claims of a mar-
ried, as against those of a single man ? Should a
married man, perhaps unsteady and inefficient,
take precedence of an able and industrious officer,
who (without an assured income) shows his good
sense by remaining single ?— Veritas.
A “ well-connected ” Englishman, who
arrived in this beastly country a year or two ago,
and condescended to enter the Civil Service, is a
bright example of how things happen in Aus-
tralia. For a year or so he was an obscure member
of the staff and a person of no special account.
Then he showed considerable ability by inheriting
some money and marrying the daughter of his
official chief. Next, a great effort was made to
shunt the imported one’s immediate superior, in
order to make room for his promotion, but the
other man resisted so violently that the attempt
failed. So the gilded youth was “ transferred ”
over the heads of more than a dozen of his seniors
to an important country district, and when last
heard from he was doing as well as could be
expected. Still, the great device of marrying the
boss’s daughter doesn’t always come off. Some
years ago a beautiful young man in a Govern-
ment office did a prolonged mash with the pretty
daughter of another departmental official, but,
owing to business considerations, reluctantly threw
her over and married a rather plain-looking girl,
whose father was head of the office. But a new
Government came in just about then, and shunted
the old man ; and the other official, having much
solid influence in the new Ministry, got his place.
That was over six years ago. The plain-looking
wife is decidedly ugly now, and is the mother of
four children. The Johnnie who married her has
had only one rise of salary in the six years. Any-
one else can be 15 minutes late without any ques-
tions being asked, but if he is 15 seconds behind
time a voice from the inner room demands an
explanation. Also, all the odd jobs which involve
unpaid overtime fall to his lot, and if he fails to
dot an “i”his attention is sternly called to the
matter. Marrying the boss’s daughter doesn’t
always pay a dividend.

Dear Sir, -1 think it my duty to inform you
that a course of your Alfahne Vitality Pills
acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness
and Biliousness.
100 Elizabeth-st., Meih., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform
you that a course of your Alfaline Pills com-
pletely cured me of a severe ease of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you
are deserving of success, which I do most
heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,
A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from General Debility of the
Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the
leading doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne,
I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses
of the Alfaline Remedies 1 am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking yon for your courtesy and
the uniform patience with which you have
treated me, allow me to say that you can
make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,
yours, CATHERINE HAGERMAN.
As witness ; John Hagerman (my husband),
caretaker, Tivoli Theatre, Castlereagh-street,
Sydney.

This Blood Remedy has been proved to surpass and exc 1 all other known and advertised

Herbal Remedy, which has stood a TEN YEARS’ TEST b. i re the Australian public, and which
is in demand by blood sufferers throughout the whole civilised «.-rld. It is purely herbal, and con-
tains, therefore, no mercury, and will completely and permanently cure the most fearful and unhappy
Itlood and Shin Diseuses.
It is recommended by the Faculty, and praised by those who have tried it, as a never-failing
Wood Purifier and Itlood Ton ie.
It has no equal, it operates upon every drop of the blood, and does not permit the slightest particle
of impurity to remain in the system.
THOSE ABOUT TO MARR
and who desire to have any possible taint removed from their bice. - , should take a course of the Rock
Rills which can only benefit the whole system. This remedy re. mves any discharges, strictures,
sores’, blotches, pimples and old-standing blood complications, ce (..inly and speedily. .Special

SPECIAL ISSUE of 8750 PREFERENCE SHARES ss. on application, ss. on Allotment.
The abovementioned Prtfeience Shares rank for dividends until the whole amount of 10s. has been repaid to the
Purchasers; they will then become Ordinary Shares in the Company.
I have the honor to inform you that your Directors have, “ in accordance with the subjoined resolutions passed at
an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on the 28lh of January,” decided to issue 8750 Shares. The
money raised by the sale of shares will be devoted in the first place to the purchase of land required for the railway
authorised by Act of Parliament during the present session, and on which the Government propose to expend £20,060.
This railway will place yonr mine in communication w'ith the railway system of the colony, and enable a large output
to be immediately attained. It is anticipated after the railway is completed that within six months the whole of the
amount subscribed by the purchasers of the 8750 shares will be refunded in dividends.
RESOLUTIONS :
Ist. To authorise the directors to issue 18,750 shares, or such portion of the same as may be necessary (being
portion of shares now held in reserve) as preference shares, at ten shillings per share, fully paid up to ten
shillings per share.
2nd. That such preference shares shall receive dividends, in all amounting to ten shillings per share, before
ordinary shares participate in any profit.
3rd. To give power to the Directors to issue such preference shares in payment of land required for railway and
mining purposes.
4th. Shares to be allotted on such terms as the Directors may consider in the best interests of the. Company, and
in allotting the same preference shall be given to the Shareholders.
W. P. JARVIE, Manager.
Note.— Shares will be allotted as applied for, but no preference will be given to Shareholders after seven days
from the date hereof. By order of the Board. W. P. JARVIE, Manager.

A subscriber to a N.S.W. country news-
paper lately sought to obtain the publication at
a reduced subscription on the ground that, since
he last paid, his wife had presented him with
twins.
“ I warn the aristocracy not to force the
people to look into the subject of taxation, not to
force them to see how they have been robbed,
and plundered, and bamboozled for ages by

Styles, the member for Williamstown
(Vic.), makes out that stoppages on the Vic.
railway lines exceed the stoppages in N.S.W.,
which has also less than half as many stations, by
2,000,000 per annum, the cost of each pause being
Bd. or 9d. This would account for an increase of
.£70,000 in working exs.
A Westraliau journal says the aboriginals
who kill the squatters’ stock over there “ show
exactly the same patriotic spirit as Tell and
Washington displayed.” It is quite possible that
100 years hence, when the blacks are all dead and
people have forgotten their ugly faces and evil-
smelling skins, new Froudes and Carlyles will
write stately histories in the vein of that Wes-
tralian paper.

The well-known Turkish Baths in Bourke-
street, Melbourne (formerly Hose’s) have passtd
into the hands of M’Manus Bros., two young men
who have been connected with the establishment
under former management, and to whose en leav< > s
to please an exacting public doubtless much of its
popularity is due. The baths, retiring rooms,
&c., have been lavishly refitted and decorated,
and are now ready to receive a host of visituis.*
Coal evidently is beginning to boom in
Victoria. A number of visitors inspected the
Ou'ttrim Coal Mine, by special excursion-train from
Melbourne on 2nd Feb. instant, and were con-
siderably astonished to find that the seam of coal
was 4ft. 9in. thick, and thac a continual stream of
bullock-teams was conveying the coal to the rail-
way. Appearances justify the belief that this
mine will take a leading position in Australia
when the necessary railway facilities are afforded.
The Outtrim, Howitt, and British Consolidated
Coal Company (no liability) are making a special
issue of 8750 preference-shares, particulars of
which are afforded by the prospectus published

Dear Bulletin, —Some additional slang
derivations: “Charlie Forrester,” shearers’name
for an oil-stone, is distorted from Oharnwood
Forrest —the kind of stone once used, now mostly
replaced by Kansas stones. “ Burnt - grass-
country”—back-blocks name for an hotel with a
good table ; feed from burnt country being sweet
and nutritious. “Toe-rag”—larrikinese for .£l-
- from the odour thereof. Wanted—source of
“ hatter,” an alluvial miner who works alone;
“borak,” humbug, chaff (larrikinese); “kip,” the
short stick used in tossing coins; “grey,” a
spieler’s double-headed coin; “peg,” larrikinese
for shilling; “monkey,” for sheep. Who were
“Jimmy Woods” and “Jack Smithers” (latter
W. and C.Q.), who have given their names to solo
drinkers? Ever noticed how few slang names for
horse in this horsey country—“neddy,” moke,”
“alligator ” (W.Q.)—none racy of the soil, none
appropriate? —Wukry M.
It is feared that the intelligence of the
falling off in silk hats in the province will
serio.usly affect Victorian stocks in London.
Conan Doyle remarks that “ no novelist
ever kills one of his characters with a disease that
takes him below the waist.”
He can’t go out without his ma,
For fear mischance might lark
With his sweet innocence ; and, ah 1
He daren’t go after dark.
But put a tax upon his set?
What, ho ! his old Bath chair !
Now, wheel him slowly, loon ! You bet,
The Old Boy will be there.
“Thank God we’ve got a Council, then,”
As someone did remark ;
Thank God, likewise, that we’ve got men
Won’t go out after dark.

writes :
“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than
any I have hitherto used, besides being free from
the heavy nauseous odour characteristic of others.
“This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
“It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations, and con-
siderably enhances its value.

A most elaborate scheme came to grief a
few days ago in Sydney. The originator of it
went round a number of jewellery and other shops
and ordered goods on a large scale, to be delivered
when paid for. He further requested that the
bill should be sent to his loving father in Rock-
hampton, and in each case he wrote a letter to the
loving father explaining the circumstances and
asking the old man to send along the money.
This letter he handed over to be enclosed with the
invoice, and the shopkeepers were much impressed
by the intensely affectionate nature of the epistle.
Then the alleged son s- oms to have gone up to
Rockhampton to conduct the other end of the
correspondence; at all events, each firm received
a letter from the alleged father also written in an
enthusiastically affectionate strain, enclosing a
cheque for the amount and something over, and
directing that the surplus should be handed over
to the offspring. It was just here that the trouble
came in. Dempster, manager for Stewart Dawson
and Co., was staggered by the old man’s lavLhness
and the affectionate manner in which he addressed
the young man who was “ blowing ” his substance
in riotous jewellery. Also, he made a mental note
of the fact that fathers, even when they pay their
sons’ jewellery bills, don't generally do it in such
extreme haste, and don’t generally write almost
exactly the same hand as their sons. In view of
all these circumstances, he called in a detective
ard the rest was chaos.

Dear Bulletin, —A few notes re Cool-
gardie. It is said here that, when exemption ex-
p-res at the end of January, sufficient men will
not be locally obtainable to work the mines.
Whether that will be so, I cannot say, but here are
two illustrations of the present state of the labor-
market. Some days ago, Bayley’s Reward 00.
called for tenders for cutting a drain 40 chains
long, 4ft. wide at the top, Ift. at bottom, and l£ft.
deep. Being hard-up, I thought I would tender.
At the time appointed to meet the surveyor, no
less than 19 hungry-looking men attended. I
offered at 10s. a chain, but did not get the job. I
have since been told that it was let at Bs. The
second case is that of a “ stiff ’’dryblower, who was
lucky enough to get a job serving at the condenser
and looking after the boilers. His hours were from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m.; wages, J6l a week and tucker.
Last week a little donkey-cart was to be seen
wending its way over the ridkety paths through
the suburbs of this dusty place.- Seated therein
was the shadow of a man, the very picture of
death. “ What’s up?” enquired inquisitive way-
farers, The driver explained that the man in the
cart was' his‘ mate, and that he was taking him
from the hospital. “ From the hospital ?” was
the astonished query. “Yes, he is discharged as
cured.” Here followed a few curses and a heap
of a|>use of the hospital authorities. I went to see
the cured man, and found that he had been down
with typhoid. It is a disgrace that men should
be turned out of a hospital in such a condition.
Fortunately this man has a good mate, but. there
are many who are as poor as crows. Is it any
wonder that so many cases of relapsed fever take
place?—Queenslander.

[FOR THE BULLETIN]
In a nook of the town, neither streetway nor alley,
At a corner drear, where no larrikin bands
Spit in the dusk, or with damsels dally,
The ghost of a grog-shop silent stands.
Four crumbling walls and some woodwork waning
Enclose a waste that is smelled afar—
Not a sign or trace in their midst remaining
Of the bar.
The din of the crowd’s distant coming and going,
Mocking the moan of a mourner in grief,
Sleeps on the breast of the wild wind blowing
Over the sign of “The Golden Sheaf ” ;
The noise of the waggon, or ’bus full-freighted,
Comes never anear to this moss-grown place,
Where slim, callow youths, by potations elated,
Went the pace.
Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,
H iply, of drinkers none ever will know—
Husbands who drank whilst their manhood was
sleeping
And wan wives, waiting, sang songs of woe ;
Johnnies, who hearkened to hoary blasphemers
Pitching lewd tales from sin-stained lips,
Or listened to touts from the turf-land of dreamers
Bringing “tips.”
Where the lean, grey cat hunts for mice on the
ashes,
Barmaids of beauty were wont to smile,
Whose eyelids, all dark at the lines of their
lashes,
Drooped over orbs that shone with guile
When a lover, snatching a red-rose token
From the summit soft of a padded breast,
Gave vows for the vows that are seldom spoken,
Save in jest.
Did true love bloom in this corner forsaken?
Is the perfume of passion still lurking nigh ?
Did a cheek turn pale when a hand was shaken
Over the counter in years gone by ?
D.d heart meet heart when the welcome clatter
Of glasses and tongues drowned a whisper low ?
Did courtship shape idols for marriage to shatter,
Long ago ?
Nothing is left—not a sign, or a story
Telling of life in. that pub., whose name
G learned bright on the glass with a golden glory
Which passed away like a hero’s fame.
Tue wild wind breathes no echo of laughter,
Laughed by the drinkers in times agone:
H ere the Spirit of Death, who shall die hereafter,
Reigns alone.

The Stuffing of Slattery .
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
The Burrowa (N.S.W.) election, just over, which
has resulted in the defeat of Tootney and the return
of Kenneth Mackay (the latter supported by the
retiring member, Tom Slattery, who was ban-
queted in Sydney last week), recalls an incident
which occurred when Tom Slattery aforesaid first
stood for the constituency. John Nagle Ryan
(Burrowa, ere it was joined to Murrumburrah,
consisted solely of Ryans) had previously re-
presented the electorate. He was a fat, easy-
going, absurdly hospitable local squatter, who
never opened his mouth except to put something
into it. Nevertheless, statesmanship soon proved
too exhausting an occupation for John Nagle
Ryan, who retired, and recommended “ Tom ”
Slattery as his successor. Thomas had just then
resigned the N.S. Wales Supreme Court pro-
thonotaryship owing to a dispute with auto-
crat, Parkes. As anyone who had sufficient
courage to beard H. Parkes in his den, as Slattery
had done, was sure to be regarded as a man of
grit, Burrowa was elated with its candidate, more
especially as the electors all detested Parkes and
were glad of an opportunity to show it by return-
ing to Parliament a man with such strong personal
and public reasons for opposing him. Here let an
elector of Burrowa take up the story :
“None of us up to this had either seen Mr,
Slattery or heard a description of his personal
appearance, but from the defiant stand he made
against Parkes we concluded that he must at
least be built on the lines of a spade-pressed bale
of wool. For in those days the majority of us —
the unwashed—held such extraordinary notions
of the outward and visible indications of courage,
power, ability, and wealth, that we could not con-
ceive it possible for these attributes to exist with-
out the accompaniment of a big bingey. Imbued
with these ideas we formed a most extra-
ordinary conception of our candidate’s physical
proportions. Judge our disappointment when,
instead of the adorable monster our fancy
had painted, a long, thin, hungry-looking pock-
marked lawyer, in a long, rusty black coat, put in
an appearance ! The shook was terrible.
“ On the night of the new-comer’s arrival many
of in rode into Burrowa from different parts of
the electorate to see and hear him, but chiefly to
see, for as long as he was physically fit we did not
trouble about his oratorical powers. Wj reached
Burrowa sometime after dark, and proceeded to
the hotel, where we were informed the can-
didate had put up. There we met one of
Nagle Ryan’s chief local supporters, who appeared
utterly despondent and half-full of whisky. This
we regarded as a bad omen, for when matters
went straight with our friend he was either quite
sober or dead-drunk, as he hated half-measures on
principle, and never indulged in them save when
upset and unable to carry his liquor like the
thorough gentleman he was.
“ After the usual salutations we asked him if
he ha,d seen the candidate. He replied that he
had. ‘ What do you think of him ?’ we next
enquired. ‘ What do I think of him,’ replied
Mick, ‘ what do I think of him ? Ah, boys, don’t
a*k me, don’t ask. We are done, boys, we are
done. He’ll niver, niver get in ! It is a swindle,
boys—he had better go back.’ ‘ Why, what’s the
matter?’ we enquired, ‘ isn’t he a clever, capable
and long-headed man—weren’t we told he was
one of the smartest men in Sydney ?’
“ ‘ We were, boys,’ said Mick ; ‘ and he is smart
and clever enough, and his head is all there. He
have a great head, but where be his belly ? He
hasn’t it, boys, he hasn’t it. He’s as thin as a
pole and has no more belly than a blackfellow’s
dog. He would only be wasting his time and ours
going to the polls.’ Here Mick fairly broke down
and wept.
“ ‘ But surely,’ we suggested, ‘the absence of a
big belly should not be a fatal obstacle to the can-
didate’s return. If he possesses a fluent and
logical tongue, backed up with an active and
reflecting brain, these qualities, together with a
spirit of honesty and patriotism, should carry
some little weight with the electors, and we think
we should do all we possibly can to secure his
return.’
“ ‘ Me boys,’ said Mick, pityingly, ‘ it is plain
from your remarks that you are new to politics.
A fluent tongue, a well-turned brain, honesty of
purpose and patriotism are attributes that are all
very well in their place, but they are no good in
politics. There is our last man, John Nagle
Ryan. Where was his fluent tongue and active
brain? He hadn’t them, boys. Share the only
once he spoke out loud during the time he repre-
sented us in Parliament was when he had the
rheumatics and couldn’t well walk across theflure,
and so he had to sing out in axing a man that was
sitting with the Ministry bow he liked Cassidy’s
new whisky. No, boys, John had neither a fluent
tongue nor an active brain, but he had what was
of more service to him—he had a big belly, lads.
The possession of a big belly put John Nagle
Ryan in, and the want of a big belly will keep
Tom Slattery out. For 20 years, boys, I have
been a voter in this electorate, and we have always
been represented by a fat man, and the people are
now so used to it that they won’t vote for a thin
one. In fact, they have no confidence in a man
without a big belly. But I have a plan that may
save us yet—and if you will come across with me
to Ryan’s and have a drink I will place it before
you, and, if you approve of it, you can afterwards
assist me to carry it out and make sure of the seat
for this man Slattery yet.’
“ We took our drinks and sat round the
table, anxiously waiting for Mick’s scheme
to defeat the opposition candidate and return
our own. At last the old man said: ‘Well,
boys, as I have already told you, this elec-
torate has always been represented by a fat man,
and the fatter the man and the bigger his belly the
more pronounced and decided has been his victory.
I think you will agree with me when I say that it
is utterly hopeless for our candidate to appear
before the public in his present wretched grass-fed
condition, but, fortunately for the purposes of my
plan, very few of the electors have seen him, and
the few who have are staunch supporters of
Ryan’s, so that, should they notice any change in
his appearance, they will know its purpose and be
silent on the matter. My plan is this, that we
form ourselves into a deputation to wait on the
candidate, place the circumstances of the case
before him, point out that it is useless for him to
appear before the electors as thin as he is, and
ask him to stuff himself; and if he has the in-
terests of this electorate at heart he will comply
with our request and make up a bingey on himself. ’
“ ‘But suppose he should refuse,’ we asked,
‘ what is to be done ? ’
“ ‘What is to be done? Well, then, boys,’ said
Mick, ‘if he should refuse, by jabers, we must
stuff him. There is no time for fooling now. The
opposition man has a big belly, and ours is not
going to the poll without one—not if I can help it,
so that if he should refuse to stuff, we must get
hold of him, take him down to my place, and
Jimmy, the tailor, will soon let a gusset into the
back of his garments; and with the aid of some
wool he’ll give him an appearance of respectability
which will secure the confidence of the electors.’
“We had fully arranged to put our plan into
operation when news reached us that the opposi-
tion candidate was taken seriously ill and had
retired in favor of a commission-agent who was
fully as thin as our ghost; so that, their corpora-
tions being about equal; we decided to have the
contest decided by a battle of brains, and our man
won. I suppose he hasn’t heard from that day to
this how near he was to being stuffed.”

anything in the book itself. Max, it seems,
calls Taylor’s well-meant little advt. an

conclusion that he is only a dreary and mechanical

see a good joke when it is brought violently under

humorist gets him down and sits on him, and ex-
plains the thing at length, and won’t let him up
until he fully understands it.

Bill Somers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
Bill Somers cheated me out of a nice little
fortune of some fifty or sixty thousand pounds.
Now, I never saw Bill Somers in my life; and he
never saw or heard of me, and did not gain a
single cent by the transaction. Nevertheless,
Bill Somers is the man I have to thank for the
present unsatisfactory condition of my finances.
I was managing my uncle’s station—it ought to
be mine, now. He lived in Sydney, paying only
an annual visit to the place. He was a bachelor,
and as he was a crusty and most argumentative
old dog, I used to think it was just as well we only
met occasionally.
Now, I myself am not argumentative except
when people don’t agree with me; still, one
cannot live with a Sir Oracle for long
without feeling obliged to differ from him occa-
sionally. Naturally, my uncle supposed himself
an authority on nearly every question under the
sun, and I have no doubt he persuaded himself
that he had really gone through the many experi-
ences he used to relate. He was never at a
loss for information to bolster his inventions;
for he could always quote a man he used to know
who knew all about it. That’s how I came to hear
about Bill Somers.
I was in Sydney for a few days on station busi-
ness, and was dining with my uncle. Charming
cottage and grounds (ought also to be mine).
Having finished all the “shop” we had to talk
about, the old gentleman was holding forth on
some sharp practices lately brought to light
amongst the provision - shipping merchants.
“Why,” he said, “in my time we would as
soon ” There he hesitated, and I chipped in,
jocularly, as 1 filled my glass : “Come, governor 1
you know you were never in the provision-ship-
ping line.”
My uncle was speechless for some time, whether
from rage or because he was making something
up I don’t know ; the latter, I suspect.
“No, sir,” he said slowly at last; “I was
never in the provision line, as you justly remark.
But, was not my friend, Bill Somers, one of the
leading provision-merchants in Sydney, and ”
here he almost shouted—“don’t I know all the
ins and outs of the business from him ?”
My uncle glowered at me for the rest of the
meal, and I was glad to get back to town.
I was engaged at that time to one of the nicest
girls in Sydney (who also ought to be mine). She
was a great favorite of my uncle’s ; and as I was
then fully justified in considering myself his heir,
I had not much thought for the future. I told
Kate all about my taking a rise out of the old man,
and, to my surprise, she told me that I was very
foolish. What was the good of contradicting my
uncle about such a trivial thing? This annoyed
me ; and although, as I said before, I am not at all
of an argumentative disposition, still I feel it my
duty to assert myself and not allow statements to
pass unchallenged when I know them untrue. I
told Kate something like this; but she did not
agree with me, and we parted rather coldly.
I went out to lunch at Nardoo Cottage next
day; but, as ill-luck would have it, we had not
got half-way through the meal when my uncle
a subject on which I hold strong views—
strong, simply because they are right. I like
neat well-done, and contend that is the proper
and healthy way to cook it. My uncle likes meat
underdone—raw, I call it; and most absurdly
insists that it is more nutritious when taken so.
Over this apparently insignificant subject we fell
out ; and, my uncle being somewhat bitter and
personal in his remarks, I retorted rather smartly
I can be very sarcastic when it pleases me) :
“ I suppose Bill Somers liked his meat raw ?”
I thought he was going to throw something at
me.
“ Bill Somers was not a jackanapes like you, so
he liked his food properly cooked,” he growled.
“Let me see,” I returned, reflectively, as I
opened a bottle of sodawater. “ You say he
traded down to the Cannibal Islands. I suppose
that is where he acquired the taste.”
“ Leave my house 1” shouted my u-ncle at the
top of his voice. I laughed, and remarked that I
would look rather queer appearing in the street
bareheaded, with a glass in one hand and a bottle
of soda in the other. This maddened him still
more, but I did not let it disturb me, for we had
rows like this whenever we met. Really, I must
admit that the old fellow had been very kind to
me.
When I met Kate that evening she said, “ How
can you be so silly as to keep irritating your
uncle ? He called here this afternoon, and I could
see that you have offended him very deeply. You
will go too far some day.”
This annoyed me very much. Kate evidently
meant that my conduct might make a difference
in my prospects ; and this, I consider, hardly
showed a proper appreciation of me. I knew that
my uncle had in reality far too much admiration
for my talents and ability to quarrel seriously.
In fact, I was quite sure that he respected me all
the more for my sturdy independence. Kate did
not agree with me, and made a most uncalled-for
remark to the effect that my conceit would
be the ruin of me. We parted still more coldly
than before, but I felt that Kate needed a lesson
as well as my uncle.
I had to return to the station in a day or two,
but was invited to dinner at Nardoo Cottage, to
meet a few friends of my uncle. He was a for-
giving old boy, I must say.
“Now, Harry,” said Kate, “do not go out of
your way to contradict your uncle this evening.
Remember the difference in your ages and posi-
tions, and wh.it you owe him.”
I gave Ka .e a bit of my mind in return, and
reduced her to tears before I left.
There were a bank-manager and two squatters
at dinner that evening, and the talk was mostly
“shop.” I rather flatter myself on having stated
my opinions upon stock-breeding and station-
management confidently and in a way that left an
impression. We were smoking with our wine,
and the subject of cigars came up. Now, lam as
good a judge of a cigar as any man, so, when my
uncle praised those we were smoking, I lost my
patience, for they were really nothing to brag
about.
“ They aren’t bad,” I commenced, “ but ”
Here the old gentleman snapped in : “ Con-
found your impudence ! Not bad, indeed ! You
conceited young blockhead ! do you know the
difference between a cigar and a cabbage ? ”
All the other old fogies chuckled ; and, very
naturally, I felt nettled. However, I knew how
to rub it in, so I exhaled a long puff of smoke and
drawled out: “ I presume Bill Somers selected
them.”
My uncle went purple. If apoplexy had only
carried him off just then, I should have been right.
He gasped, and then restraining his passion by a
great effort, said quite quietly, “ I have a word to
say to you later on.”
I was very facetious the rest of the evening.
Emboldened by the way I had put the old man
down, I had two or three more sly little hits about
Bill Somers, until I felt that I must not wear the
joke threadbare. That’s the best of my wit—l
always know when to stop ; I don’t run a thing to
death like most men. At a sign from my uncle, I
stayed behind when the others left.
“Henry Jamison,” he said, “you appear to
have deliberately gone ouc of your way to insult
me every time you have accepted my hospitality.
To-morrow you will return to Grimgums (the
station), and remain there until you hear from me.
Good night.”
He certainly had the last word, and as I strolled
townward I felt very wroth at the mean and
unjust accusation he had brought against me.
Just because he was too dense to understand my
perhaps rather subtle humor and certainly harm-
less chaff, he said that I “insulted” him. I
returned to Grimgums feeling very sure that my
■uncle would be extremely sorry for his conduct.
Scarcely bad I been a week on the station when I
received the following astounding epistle :
Dear Mr. Jamison.
If you look back, as I have done, you will, I am sure,
agree with me that our tempers are not sufficiently
sympathetic to hold out any prospect of happiness in the
future. I have no wish to enter into details, as I know a
little reflection will convince you that I am acting for the
best. Your uncle, who was always in favor of our en-
gagement, reluctantly admits that lam right. We will,
therefore, consider the engagement at an end, but I shall
always remain your sincere friend,
Katb Denby.
Was there ever such a shameful thing? Just
because a girl cannot have everything her own
way, she deliberately throws a man over. This
letter was enough to give me food for thought,
but I was fairly puzzled by one I received from
my uncle a few days later. In It there was the
following passage :
So through your infernal conceit and foolish want of
tact you have lost one of the best girls in the world ; but
there is one thing I can tell you: you will be the only
loser in the matter—she certainly shall not.”
Fancy ! I, conceited ! A more modest man does
not live. I may have sufficient self-respect to
estimate myself at my right value, but that is all.
Explanation of ray uncle’s remark came to me
in the form of a newspaper with a marked para-
graph soma six weeks later. My uncle and Kate
Denby were married !!!
I was so justly incensed that I resigned my
billet at once. This happened three years ago,
and the other day my uncle died—leaving a widow
and a son and heir.
I suppose the brat’s godfather was Bill Somers.
