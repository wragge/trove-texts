Sydney; Sirs: —I am in receipt of Belt
and books of instruction, and can safely
say that your advertisements are very truthful in regard to
the statement that a man feels the electrical strength of
the belt as soon as it is placed on his body, for I felt the effect
of the belt as soon as I placed it on, and believe me, lam
a sure advocate of this belt.”
From England. .
Mr. Chas. Middleton, of No. 76 Aston St., Birmingham,
speaksas follows: “I can say that I have felt better, a great
deal, since I have used your Galvanic Chain Belt, and I
thank you very much. I hove taken patent medicines but
I shall not lake any more. You can use my name in praise
of your Belt.” _ -

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1893.
The Second Ballot.
The leading principle of constitutionalgovern-
ment is that the policy of the State shall
be the expression of the opinion of the
majority. There is nothing specially beauti-
ful or intelligent about the majority that it
should thus till the place of a god, only it is
the best god chat can be found. As a matter
of fact, however, the majority never has
ruled the State, and the time when it will
do so is still, apparently, a long way distant.
In the first place, women are excluded from
the franchise in all the Australian provinces,
and a trifle over onedialf the adult popula-
tion has thus no semblance of a direct voice
in the conduct of the State. Of the other
half, or rather Jess than half, a certain
portion, in most of the Austi’alias, is manned
down by tlie brick-and-mortar vote of Pro-
perty. and, with one exception, every
Legislative Assembly now existing in Aus-
tralia and Tasmania was elected under this
brick-and-mortar suffrage. Then the majority
is smothered once more through a multipli-
city of candidates and the want of a second
ballot. In an enormous number of cases a
single-member constituency is contested by
five or six politicians, and among the
struggles of Protectionists, Foreign-traders,
Democrats, Single-taxers and others, the
local butcher-man and alderman, with his
solid following of a few score personal
friends, who reverence him for his voci-
ferousness. at the council board, generally
gets in, as the representative of one-fifth, or
less, of the electors, and one-twelfth, or a
good deal less, of the adult population.
# * •
When more than one half of the popula-
tion has been disfranchised in the first
instance, and, perhaps, one-third of the re
mainder has not gone to the poll, and four-
fifths of the subsequent remainder has voted
to no purpose through too much confusion of
candidates, and the brick-and-mortar vote
has nullified the suffrages of many more, and
the butcher alderman is triumphantly re-
turned, the process is still incomplete.
Through the glorified butcher-man an infini-
tesimal fraction o! Ihe constituency.certainly
does enjoy a vague and uudefinable measure
of self-government, and gets a share in
the control of the State. But it isn’t
much of a share at the best. The local
flesh - monger or temperance - lodge god
or boss publican can raise his dissonant
voice in the Assembly, and can take
a hand in ejecting the old Government
though he has no influence in the creation of
the new one, but in the other House the
majority has not even a show of being
represented. Also, it has no control over
the Governor, and no voice in his appoint-
ment, and the Sovereign, who is the power
behind the Governor, is altogether beyond
its influence. Therefore, the fiction that
constitutional government is government by
the largest half of the people is a very thin
pretence indeed. Even among the male
population it seldom happens that more than
a third is really represented, and that in
only one-half of the Legislature. Which
third it may be that gets even this amount
of representation depends on the skill with
which each party works the great political
swindle in its own interests.
# • *
The situation is gradually improving in
certain respects, though, as we have re-
marked, th'e day of government by the largest
number isstill along way oft‘. When the brxck-
and mortar vote is extinct, and the suffrage
is extended equally to both sexes, and the
Upper House is abolished or made an elective
body upon a universal-suffrage basis, and
Ministers are chosen by vote of the whole
Legislature instead of being appointed by
secret negotiation with the leader of a party,
still the majority will not necessarily rule.
In fact, as parties increase in number
through the disintegration of the old system
of Government by Contradiction, its chances
may possibly grow worse rather than
better. Even in the days when there were
almost always only two parties in politics—
no more and no less—it frequently hap-
pened that two candidates appeared on one
side, or sometimes two appeared on each
side, and occasionally the two parties mus-
tered five or six candidates between them
for a single seat. Then the “local man,”
whose one strong point was that he promised
to block the whole business of the country
unless new roads were made all through his
electorate, generally got in amid the con-
fusion. But, nowadays, in New South
Wales, with single electorates and the aboli-
tion of the old £4O deposit, and with five
or six parties in the field, each with a
possibility of anywhere from one to half-a-
dozen candidates, there are only two results
to be expected. One is the advent of a
Parliament of aldermen each intent only
upon getting public money for the pound or
the gaol in his own electorate—a Parliament
that will be the apotheosis of vulgar
parochial beadledom, and the crowning glory
of the little, sawn-off provincial Bumble.
And the other is the sudden uprising of one
strong-lunged fad which, by sheer energy
and good management, may sweep the con-
stituencies and get a majority in the Assem-
bly while hardly representing one-tenth of
the country ac large.
* » *
At next New South Wales election there
will be more candidates than there have ever
been on any single occasion since the begin-
ning of the province. It would be impossible
to throw a brick down George-street, Syd-
ney, to-day without seriously injuring at
least six intending candidates. The Protec-
tionist, Foreign-trade, and Labour-parties
will contest almost all the constituencies, the
Single-taxers and teetotallers will contest
many of them, and the inevitable local can-
didate or road-and-bridge fiend will contest
everything. Among them they may muster
anything up to a dozen applicants for each
separate seat. And if, amid all this confu-
sion, one party, even though it be a weak
one, developes a good organisation and pro-
duces a strung leader, and nominates in each
constituency a single candidate who will get
the block vote of the party, there is hardly
any fad so hopeless that it will not get a
hearing. Under such conditions a frWizied
Social Gimlet majority might be returned to
Parliament, or a rabid teetotal Ministry
might come into power, or a Cabinet of
publicans might be formed with the sylph-
like Bevill as Minister for Drink or Under-
secretary for Gin. The only existing
safeguard against such a contingency is
the fact that no one party is very much
better organised than the rest, and owing to
this the probabilities are that instead of
one fad something like half-a-dozen will come
to the front. The most likely result is that
the old Foreign-traders and Protectionists
and the Labour-party, who, among them,
probably represent nine-tenths of the voting
power of the country, will lose heavily
through party disorganisation, and that the
teetotallers, the Single-taxers, the Social
Purity crowd, and, above all, the parochial
alderman, will fill half, or more than half,
th e Legislature, and reduce politics to chaos.
# • #
The Second Ballot is not an absolute
remedy for the uncertainties of the existing
system, but it is a remedy of a kind, and
probably the best one yet devised. It pro-
vides a court of appeal from the first decision
of the electors, and though the court of
appeal may at times go wrong, it is much
be ter than no court at all. Its principle is
that the elected Candidate must receive an
absolute majority of the votes polled, so that
if 1000 votes are cad in an election 501 is the
lowest number on which a member can be
returned, whereas at present, if, say, eight
candidates go to the poll the successful one
could be returned by 126 votes —most of
them, possibly, the votes of his own rela-
tions. Where no candidate gets a definite
majority at the first vote the two highest on
the list have to go to a second ballot, and as
the suffrages are then divided between two men
only the verdict is often reversed on appeal,
and the local alderman, or the man who has
come out at the top of a list of six or eight
through the block vote of a small knot of
faddists, is utterly wiped out. The one
weak point of the Second Ballot is this :
In a strongly Labour or Protectionist or
Foreign-trade constituency it is possible for
the votes to be so much split up among a
multiplicity of candidates that the local
road-and-bridge fiend may come out on top,
with the teetotal or Social Gimlet faddist
next, while the men who really represent the
mass of popular opinion occupy the tail-end
of the list. Then the second contest would
lie between the alderman and the Social
Purity crank, and whichever got in, the
bulk of the electors would still be unrepre-
sented. But such a case would be of very
rare occurrence. It is common enough in a
much-contested election for the delegate of a
very small but iron-jawed minority to secure
a majority of votes, but that is all, and the
Second Ballot would reduce him to his native
insignificance.
* * *
Unless the Second Ballot is adopted, the
next New South Wales Assembly will appar-
ently consist mainly of small parochial
celebrities. It will be a gathering of beadles
and inspectors of nuisances, each firmly con-
vinced that the sun sets in his back-yard and
immediately behind his fowl-house ; and
each willing to vote for Imperial Federation
or an elective Upper House or another Colo
\ alley syndicate as the price of a new gaol
and court-house for his own electorate, and
a cockspur railway to some town which is
not yet built. Also there will be a few of
the old chronic politicians in the House, who
will form a Government among themselves
and manipulate the dull-wdtted aldermen ; a
few wild-haired cranks, and some sundries.
But the first-named class, judging from
present appearances, will predominate ; and
for the good of the country the choice
apparently lies between the Second Ballot
and the summary execution of all the
aldermen in New South Wales. For noth-
ing short of execution would quench the
desire that springs eternal in the breast of
every alderman to get into Parliament, and
his arrival there is an evil which should be
averted at any cost—even at the cost of
bloodshed.
“Lay to your Book.”
The suicide at Coogee Bay, near Sydney, of
Theodore Sampson, bookmaker, is burdened
with one great moral. Before running out to the
seaside resort to kill himself, Sampson left
behind him the following letter :
Tattersall’s Hotel, Pitt-street, Sydney.—My reason for
committing suicide is that 1 cannot keep away from
gambling and backing horses. I have lost all I had, and
run further into debt since yesterday week ; and, as I see
no prospect of bettering my condition or paying what I
owe, I feel compelled to do this rash deed. I have no one
to blame but myself. Everybody has been very kind to
me, especially James Dobson ; but I have the curse of the
gambler in me, and cannot stop ; in fact, am never at rest
till I’m either playing cards or backing horses. I wish all
my old friends at Tattersall’s a better fate than that what
now awaits me.— Theodore Sampson.
This is not a letter from a suicidal fool who,
failing to achieve any sort of celebrity during
life, and thinking that he has literary points
which the world ought to admire, seeks to
achieve one blast of notoriety by writing a
letter to a coroner ere making his exit from an
unappreciative audience. It is the plain busi-
ness statement of a plunger who recognises at
last a fact that most of his friends had seen
before—that he had “overlaid” his “book.”
The spectre of Theodore Sampson is gurgling
from the grave the world-applicable advice—
“ Lay to your book ; lay to your book only ;
don’t depart from your book.”
• # «
In every avenue of life, the fatal tendency of
even brilliant men to “ lay ” away from their
“book” is continually seen. These men con-
stitute the ultimate failures of society. To
their successors—some now graduating, and
some not yet begun—the last epistle of Sampson
was specially addressed. He blew out his brains
chiefly because he couldn’t pay his debts, and
he hadn’t the skunk-like capacity to live on in
an underground fashion and evade his credi-
tors. He “gambled” and “backed” horses.
No bookmaker should commit either of these
follies. A cold-blooded, well-balanced book-
maker merely “lays” to his “book”—he
doesn’t “gamble,” or “back” one chance
against many ; but unemotionally takes many
chances against one, in methodically-calculated
combinations and permutations, and is tolerably
indifferent to the individual result. The same
cold faculty marks the successes in every
business occupation followed by man ; while a
similar rashness to Sampson’s “curse of the
gambler ” directs and causes most of the
failures everywhere.

What reader of these sentences cannot recall
numerous instances in point? Professional
men, some of them making thousands a year,
and. deservedly so, at the businesses in which
they are masters, “lay” away from their
“books” in speculations or follies or fads,
which alluringly engross them, but as to the
intricacies of and laws governing which they
are the merest babes-iu-arms. The general
public, knowing of their great incomes, gapes
with wonder when their downfall comes—■
generally suddenly. Stdck-and-share gamblers
are of this order. Feverishly they gamble,
living alternately at the extremes of human
tension, now worth a paper million, anon carry-
ing a paper liability sufficient to sink a nation
into a sponging-house, but always with their
incoming hard-cash reality a vanisher into ex-
change. They “ lay ” away from their “ book,’
and pit their miserable “luck” against an in-
finity of chances, among which also there ar e a
multitude of certainties. Contrast with them
their sober-nerved agents, the brokers—that Ja
to say, the human machines among brokers who
merely buy and sell scrip for others “ on com-
mission.” These “ lay ”to their “ books,” and
depart not from the moderate rewards of
certainties. They do not plunge, but merely
accept sliding-scale wages for facilitating the
plunges of others. Bubbles burst; the dis-
tracted ex-millionaire slits Ids weasand ; but
the level-headed broker remains for ever as the
unimpassioned machine which can’t go wrong.
Fires won’t thaw him ; frosts can’t freeze him.
He “ lays ” to his “ book.”

See the diggings storekeeper—the man who
knows he is a storekeeper and nothing else,
and won’t be tempted to leave the business in
which he is an expert. All old-time minds
know his type. Heavy gold is suddenly
struck. There is a delirium on the rush. The
storekeeper is also butcher for the community.
Five hundred men crowd him on “killing”
day. They help him to “kill” and “dress”,
his meat, and then cheerfully plank down from
sixpence to a shilling a pound for it. He rakes
in the gold. But when a man wants him to
buy into a promising claim, he figures things '
out concerning his store and says, at least men-
tally, “ No, I will not 4 lay ’ against my
4 book.’” He will give ex-customers tuckei
out of his plenty; he won’t buy into any
44 shows.” He 44 lays ”to his 44 book.” When
the diggings are played out and a hundred men
who might have had piles are 44 stone-broke,’
this stolid storekeeper returns to civilisation
and is accepted as a wonderful instance of
pluck and sagacity, whereas he has only exhi-
bited all along the sheep-sense of knowing w hen
he is safe. 44 Lay to your book” —that is the
text of the funeral-sermon of Theodore Same-
son.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More “ Thrift.”
One “Alfred Saunders” of Leichhardt, or
an individual who professes to be Saunders,
has lately started to demonstrate, in Sydney
Telegraph, how a family of eight can live
comfortably, and save money, out of 30s. per
week. Saunders, according to his own clumsy
and obviously bogus statement, is in a clerical
position and has to keep up “a fair appearance.’’
This is how he does it :
First of all, the cottage in which we live is at Leich-
hardt and contains three bedrooms, kitchen, parlour and
dining-room. 1 work three miles off and don’t use a
conveyance, six miles being a nice walk per day and not
too hard on the boots. 1 have learnt how to cobble a
litlle, and take it as a pastime to mend any broken or
worn shoe. We never have the doctor, my w ife using
what are called “ old women’s ” remedies, and they prove
just as efficacious as a doctor. We don’t buy soap or
candles, as from the fat saved from the meat we barter it
with a soap company, and receive candles and soap in
return. We don’t buy vegetables, as in a little plot at
the back my wife takes a pleasure in growing sufficient
for our needs. We hardly pay anything for clothes for
the children, as with a few shillings my w'ife now ami
again buys remnants from tailor shops sufficient to
make them well-dressed. With ss. we get from a meat-
shop in George-street West enough flesh, and more than
enough, to last us for the week. With. ss. mo>e out
groceries are bought at Paddy’s Market. Of course,’, the
children mainly use go.den syrup for butter. The sum of
ss. pays for bread, as wit i flour and yeast cheap my wife
makes up this necessary every day. We don’t pay any-
thing for milk, as we use the preserved, and that is in-
cluded in the ss. for groceries Sometimes we pay Is. a
week for fresh milk for the baby.. We have, accordingly,
after all these payments, ss. a week for the savings' b'ank,
which makes £l3 a year, and interest 10s. extra at 4 per
cent. Some of this goes in clothing for wife and self, and
some of the children. I have existed for five years on the
30s. a week, and have now as accumulations, the result of
ss. a week, £3O Is. 6d.
It will be seen from the above statement that
there are no coals used in the Saunders
family ; that there are never any new
boots; that the family either uses very little
soap and candles, or else gets an amazing
amount of fat out of very little beef ; that it
gets through on very little vegetables—a back-
yard at Leichhardt doesn’t go far as a kitchen-
garden for eight; that there are no amusements
in the household, no books and no newspapers.
We may add that, as a further economy, there
isn’t any Sau.nders. It is only the eternal Fat
Man demonstrating over again the advantages of
an impossible system of Thrift, and showing how
the poor ought to be contented and happy after
the fashion of an impossible Jiouseholder lead-
ing a Chinese existence at Leichhardt. Even il
that alleged inhabitant were a reality he
wouldn’t be an example, but rather an awful
warning, to his fellow-men. The man who
institutes in his household such a dietary—no
butter, no cream (condensed milk is creamless)
and no fat to speak of—is simply starving his
children to death. If Thrift ever becomes
general, as the Fat Man says it should be, and
the world becomes full of Saunderses, then all
the tailors, bakers, bootmakers, cobblers, and
most of the grocers must close up for want
of support ; also the jewellers, publicans, dis-
tillers, brewers, tobacconists, greengrocers, the
theatrical profession, the parsons—for the people
will be too economical toput anything in the plate
—the booksellers, artists, musicians, chemists,
chiropodists, confectioners, coach-builders, cab-
men, omnibus-drivers, florists, fishmongers,
hair-dressers—for each family will cut its own
hair with a basin—photographers, toy-makers,
and several hundred more. All these would be
thrown out of employment, and in the utter
paralysis of everything Alfred Saunders’
employer would have to reduce his wages to
155., or else he would burst up, and presently
he and Saunders would both live by prospect-
ing for bones and fragments of bread in the
dust-boxes. If ever the doctrine of Thrift gets
a firm hold upon the community, then
civilisation will fade away, and the country
will get back to first principles, and
arts and sciences will be forgotten, and
everybody will live on vegetables of his own
growing and dress in a cheap calico rem mb tied
round his middle. Unavoidable Thrift is an
evil, but as for the premeditated kind which is
preached as a virtue by the Fat Man, it is the
most enduring blight that could settle down
upon any community. It is a mental paralysis,


a leprosy of the soul, and anybody reasonably
suspected of it should be shunned by his fellow-
men,
Mrs. Bourke, widow and mother of five
children, having gained before two N.S. Wales
Supreme Court tribunals a verdict of £7OO and
costs against Sydney City Council, for corporate
carelessness through which her husband was
killed, the Council threatens to carry an appeal to
the British Privy Council, promising, however,
to give Mrs. Bourke £2OO if the N.S. Wales
verdict be upset. It is time that Australia
abolished appeals to the British Privy Council;
it is a poor, mean, enslaved country that can-
not finally determine its own lawsuits. The
British Privy Council is too often the last
desperate instrument by which the rich man
plays legal poker with his poorer antagonist.
Sydney City Council, moreover, is playing with
the ratepayers’ money when thus proposing to
bluff off a miserable widow by making the law
too expensive for her. The law of the N.S.
Wales Supreme Court is quite good enough for
citizens of N.S. Wales ; besides, in dealing with
the claim of a workman’s widow, the citizens
don’t shriek for technicalities of law, but are
content with honest, manly arbitration. A
Judge and jury have arbitrated. That is
enough.
Aldermen John Thomas West and Hugh
M‘Leod, of Cowra (N.S.W.), in municipal con-
clave, had a dispute wdiich ended in a challenge
to “come outside.” They “went.” Two
rounds were fought. In the first, West knocked
M'Leod down ; in the second, M‘Leod reversed
the proceeding. Honours being easy, mutual
friends pulled the sloggers apart, and awful
eventualities were prevented. West is coroner
for the district, and had he killed M‘Leod, who
is the village blacksmith, he would have had
to sit on the body and be Cobbloquent against
himself as a dreadful manslaughterer, while his
horse would have to go unshod. Had West
himself been killed, he would have had to con-
duct his own inquest and direct a verdict of
justifiable homicide, on the ground that no
coroner had ever been provided with a more
professional corpse. However, none of these
things happened. What did occur was that an
evil-minded and uncivilised policeman sum-
moned both magnates for “ riotous behaviour,”
and (according to Cowra Free Press) :
When the case xxas called Seigt. Harvey explained the
circumstances under w hich the charge was laid, and he
B.xid that had he been in town he would not have taken
these proceedings, as he had lately received a circular
from the Department of Justice cautioi ing the police to
exercise discretion in proceeding against r> speclable per-
sons upon trivial charges. He asked that the charges
might be withdrawn, to which Mr. Connelly consented
on the understanding that the defendants should pay 7 the
costs of court, 7s.
So that it is actually a departmental command
that “respectable persons” say brawling
aldermen—are to be permitted to misdemean
and riotously behave while the police “exercise
discretion ” and run in the common man who
hits back at his common challenger. After
which, the beak “exercises discretion” by
ordering one or both of the common men to be
hung up in bonds and flogged into respectability.
“Let Justice be Done !” exclaims a Melbourn®
correspondent of The Bulletin. Thank heaven,
the rulers of Australia never depart from this
maxim ! They apply it invariably, though, of
course, not unvaryingly, for the circumstances
of each case w T ill call for some difference in the
modulation of the tone. The variation is chiefly
in the accentuation of the word “ done.” “ Let
Justice be ‘done’!” When the writer was a
hoy he attended a class for instruction in the
French language, and the various equivalents
of the English term “done ” having been dilated
upon, he was asked to translate “ This meat is
not done,” to which he responded satisfactorily.
The youth sitting next, who had not been
attending to the lesson, but caught at the sound
of what had been said, was then required to
render into French the phrase at the head
hereof. At a rash guess he hazarded : “ Que
la Justice soit cuile!” Let Justice he cooked. He
erred, but erred strangely like the truth.
The liquidators of the South Melb. Building
Society have been authorised to spend another
£5OO in prosecuting their old friend Matthias
Larkin on certain forgery charges. At first
blush this appears to be a vindictive kicking of
a man who is down, and as such will Fat Man
describe the proceedings. Practically, how-
ever, it is an expenditure of £5OO by Larkin’s
victims in doing work which the Crown ought
to have taken off their hands. Already the
Society has been put to the expense of two
trials in getting its ex-secretary convicted of
embezzlement. The first jury included one or
more persons who affirmed that Larkin was
‘a d d good fellow,” and a second jury was
necessary before he could be got into gaol at
ah. The sentence he received, taken in con-
junction with the conditions under which it is
neing served, doesn’t satisfy the people who lost
their money, They complain that much of the
coin in question was “planted,” and that
Matthias would in three years he strolling out
°f gaol, in a fat and jovial condition, to live
npon the fruits of his rascality. Also it is
suggested that a number of influential sympa-
thisers might work up a demonstration of
welcome to the unfortunate gentleman,
an, i persuade Parliament to pass a
vote of confidence in his innocence.
To obviate this extra infliction of gall upon
scores of people whose prospects in life went
bung with Matthias’ downfall, the chief credi-
t | ors > disgusted at the Crown’s cynical in-
difference to frauds in general and this cruel
fraud in particular, have decided to “go ” for
Larkin as far as they can. One South Melb,
citizen offers £lOO towards the cost of a forgery-
tnal, another says he will “ shout” £5O for the
same purpose,Jand the spirit that animates these
inenisnot altogetheraspiritof private vengeance,
but partly of publicanxiety topreventatleast one
financial criminal from having the laugh of the
Law. Larkin, it has to be remembered, was
* n unblushing swindler, who reckoned on the
n—-—d good fellow ” cry to assist him when
cue pinch came. His deliberate game through-
®ut was to get the maximum amount of money
f°r the minimum quantity of gaol. At this
particular juucture, the moral effect of a bit
more gaol for Matthias, should he be foun u
guilty, would probably he beneficial to th
community.
When the precious Freehold Investment Co.
had come to the end of its tether and appealed
for a “ renewal of deposits,” Matthew Davies
and his private accountant valued shares in the
concern at par. At the same time, Feb.
1892, Matthew and his accountant also valued
the E. and A. Mortgage Bank shares at par.
These artless estimates were intended only for
“ Sir Matthew’s private information, and not
for the purpose of being used in any way,”
but they are now trotted out as evidence of the
knight’s good faith in “securities.” The idea
set up by this balderdash is decidedly funny.
Matthew and his private accountant used
to meet together at brief intervals and prove by
figures that the land-boom had never really gone
bung. Matthew’s private accountant will
henceforth carry half the moral responsibility
of his master’s financial errors. Matthew
arrived at no conclusions without consulting
that expert. It was the private accountant
who first informed him that the Mer-
cantile Bank was not quite as strong as
Matthew could wish ; but this startling sur-
prise didn’t fall upon the chairman of directors
until two or three days before the Bank
stopped. When the half-yearly meeting took
place (which was a whole fortnight previous
to the catastrophe) Matthew considered the
Bank was as strong as a rock, and he and his
private accountant had dhubtless valued the
shares at par. Pah !

The Medical Bill, which Dr. Maclaurin ran
so merrily through N.S.W. Legislative Council
last week, has much improved by its 12 months’
keeping. Then it was heralded by a brochure
which the Speaker of the Assembly declined to
allow into circulation, although the Bill-framers
had succeeded in getting it printed in the
Government Printing Office at public expense.
Then, too, the proposed Council of Ten was to
be composed of five nominees of the Govern-
ment and five of the Senate of Sydney Univer-
sity, and the terms of office were so cir-
cumscribed as to virtually make the Senate
supreme. On the whole, it looked, and
was pretty generally taken to be, a bold
move, by what might be called a particular
clique, to subordinate the whole profession to
one class. As it now re-appears, it is free from
many of the old cliquey thumb marks. The
brochure is dead. The Council will be made
up of four members nominated by Government,
four by medical practitioners throughout the
country, and only two by the University Senate.
Provision is also made for the right of a man
struck off the register to appeal to the Supreme
Court, and it is laid down that the striking off
must be due to misconduct injurious to the
public, and not merely affecting professional
etiquette. So great an advance has been made
in the twelve mouths, that the Assembly may
be tempted to try the effect of another delay on
other features of the Bill.
A Basket of Breadfruit.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was in Steinberger’s time. A trader
had come up in his boat from the end of Savaii,
the largest of the Samoan Group, and was on his
way home again when the falling tide caused him
to stop awhile at Mulinu’u Point, about two miles
from Apia. Here he designed to smoke and talk
and drink kava at the great camp with some
hospitable native acquaintances during the rising
of the water. Soon he was taking his ease on a
soft mat, watching the bevy of aua luma “chaw-
ing ” kava.
Now, the trader lived at Falealupo, at the ex-
treme westerly end of Savaii, but the Samoans, by
reason of its isolation and extremity, have for
ages called it by another name—an unprintable
one—and so some of the people present began to
jest with the trader for living in such a place. He
fell in with their humour and said that if those
present would find him for wife a girl unseared by
the breath of scandal he would leave Falealupo
for Safune, where he had bought land.
“ Malie ! ” said an old dame with one eye and
white hair, “ the papalagi is inspired to speak
wisdom to-night; for at Safune grow the sweetest
nuts and the biggest taro and breadfruit; and, 10,
there among the kava-chewers is a young maid
from Safune —mine own grand-daughter Salome.
And against her name can no one in Samoa laugh
in the hollow of his hand,” and the old creature,
amid laughter and cries of Esa, e le md le lo matua
(The old woman is without shame), crept over to
the trader, and, with one hand on his knee, gazed
steadily into his face with her one eye.
* # #
The trader looked at the girl—at Salome.
She had, at her grandmother’s speech, turned her
head aside, and taking the “chaw” of kava-root
from her pretty mouth, dissolved into shame-faced
tears. The trader was a man of quick percep-
tions, and he made up his mind to do in earnest
what he had said in jest—this because of the tears
of Salome. He quickly whispered to the old
woman, “Come to the boat before the full of the
tide and we will talk.”
When the kava was ready for drinking, the
others present had forgotten all about the old
woman and Salome, who had both crept away
unobserved, and an hour or two was passed in
merriment, for the trader was a man well liked.
Then, when he rose and said to fa, they begged
him not to attempt to pass down in his boat inside
the reef, as he was sure to be fired upon, for how
were their people to tell a friend from an enemy
in the black night? But he smiled, and said his
boat was too heavily-laden to face the ocean swell.
So they bade him to fa, and called out manuia oe!
(bless you!) as he lifted the door of thatch and
went.
« • «
The old woman awaited him, holding the
girl by the hand. On the ground lay a basket,
strongly tied up.’ Salome still wept, but the old
woman angrily bade her cease and enter the boat,
which the crew had now pushed bow-on to the
beach. The old woman lifted the basket and care-
fully put it on board.
“ Be sure,” she said to the crew, “ not to sit on
it, for it is but ripe breadfruit I am taking to my
people in Manono.”
“Give them here to me,” said the trader,
and he put them in the stern out of the
way. The old woman came aft, too, and
crouched at his feet and smoked a sului.
The cool land-breeze freshened as the sail
was hoisted, and then the crew besought the
trader not to run down inside the reef. Bullets,
they said, if fired in plenty, always hit something,
and the sea was fairly smooth outside the reef.
And old Lupetea grasped his hand and muttered
in his ear, “For the sake ot this my little daughter
go outside. See, now, I am old, and to lie when
so near death as I am is foolish. Be warned by
me and be wise; sail out into the ocean, and at
daylight we will be at Salua in Manono. Then
thou canst set my feet on the shore —I and the
basket. But the girl shall go with thee. Thou
canst marry her, if that be to thy mind, in the
fashion of the papalagi, or take her fa’a Samoa
(Samoan fashion). Thus will I keep faith with
thee. If the girl be false, her neck is but little
and thy fingers strong.”
Now, the trader thought in this wise : “This is
well for me, for if I get the girl away thus quietly
from all her relations I will save much in pre-
sents,” and his heart rejoiced, for although not
mean he was a careful man. So he steered his boat
between the seething surf that boiled and hissed
on both sides of the boat-passage.
# * *
As the boat sailed past the misty line of
cloud-capped Upolu, the trader lifted the girl up
beside him and spoke to her. She was not afraid
of him, she said ; for many had told her he was a
good man, and not a ula vale (scamp), but she
wept because now, save her old grandmother, all
her kinsfolk were dead. Even but a day and
a-half ago her one brother was killed, with her
cousin. They were strong men, but the bullets
were swift, and so they died. And their heads
had been shown at Matautu. For that she had
grieved and wept and eaten nothing, and the
world was cold to her.
“ Poor little devil !” said the trader to himself—
“hungry.” Then he opened a locker and found a
tin of sardines. Not a scrap of biscuit. There
was plenty of biscuit, though, in the boat, in
fifty-pound tins, but on these mats were spread
whereon his crew were sleeping. He was about to
rouse them when he remembered the old dame’s
basket of ripe breadfruit. He laughed and looked
at her. She, too, slept, coiled up at his feet. But,
first, he opened the sardines and placed them
beside the girl, and motioned her to steer. Her
eyes gleamed like diamonds in the darkness as she
answered his glance, and her soft fingers grasped
the tiller. Very quickly, then, he felt among the
packages aft till he came to the basket.
A quick stroke of his knife cut the cinnet that
lashed the sides together. He felt inside. “ Only
two, after all, but big ones, and no mistake.
Wrapped in cloth, too ! I wonder—Hell and
furies, what’s this?” —as his fingers came
in contact with something that felt like
a human eye. Drawing his hand quickly
back, he fumbled in his pockets for a
match, and struck it. Breadfruit ! No. Two
heads with closed eyes, and livid lips blue with
the pallor of death, showing their white teeth.
And Salome covered her face and slid down in
the bottom of the boat again, and wept afresh for
her cousin and brother, and the boat came up in
the wind, but no one awoke.
» * *
The trader was angry. But after he had
tied up the basket again he put the boat on her
course once more and called to the girl. She
crept close to him and nestled under his overcoat,
for the morning air came across the sea from the
dew-laden forests and she was chilled. Then she
told the story of how her grandarn had begged
the heads from those who had taken them
at Matautu and then gone to the camp at Mulinu’u
in the hope of getting a passage in some boat to
Manono, her country, where she would fain bury
them. And that night he had come, and old
Lupetea had rejoiced and sworn her to secrecy
about the heads in the basket. And that also was
why Lupetea was afraid for the boat to go down
inside the passage, for there were many enemies
to be met with, and they would have shot old
Lupetea because she was of Manono. That was
all. Then she ate the sardines, and, leaning her
head against the trader’s bosom, fell asleep.
* # m
As the first boom of the great crested
pigeon sounded the dawn, the trader’s boat sailed
softly up to Salua beach, and old Lupetea rose,
and, bidding the crew good-bye, and calling down
blessings on the head of the good and clever
whiteman, as she rubbed his and the girl’s noses
against her own, she grasped her Basket of Bread-
fruit and went ashore. Then the trader, with
Salome by his side, sailed out again into the
ocean.
LOUIS BECKK.
Probably the most comical bull yet per-
petrated in N.S.W. Legislature was that scored
by B. R. Wise, who, being of opinion that the
Assembly (and, therefore, every member of it)
was legally non-existent, arose to point out that
Hassall, M.P., was “a stranger.” Mr. Wise’s
application to the Deputy-Speaker to resolve the
point was another weird absurdity, for if that
officer decided in the affirmative then he thereby
decided that there was no Deputy-Speaker to
decide anything.
One result of the tactics of the Sydney
Active Service Brigade is the cutting off of the
gas from a number of political bags which held
themselves ready for inflation these last two or
three weeks. Fully half-a-dozen members and
possible members felt the popular pulse last week,
in the hope of being encouraged to mount the
platform, but every “ feel ” brought an assurance
that the Active Service Brigade would be there,
and so the noble patriots incontinently ducked.
Neild’s amend the Criminal Law
Amendment Act of 1891 was conceived, born and
thrown into N.S.W. Parliament solely to reverse
the law of five Supreme Court judges on the
question—“ Should the refusal of an accused to
give evidence in his own case be necessarily con-
strued against him ? ” When Justices Innes and
Stephen held that an inference could not be drawn
by the Bench from a prisoner’s silence they were
outvoted. The Bulletin is not discussing the
merits of the question when it points out that
prisoner Makin was hanged by the lawyers in
probable defiance of the intentions of the Parlia-
ment that passed the Act.

Ballance succeeded, after arduous fight, in sending
up twelve democrats in the hope that they would
infuse some life into the House of Kidney-fits.
The result shows that the nominee disease can’t
be patched or mended—it can only be cured by
the death of the patient. Already some of
Ballance’s democrats begin to prove unreliable on
occasion, and they will grow more unreliable as
time goes on. Not one man in a hundred can be
trusted as a nominee in a House of Tory tradi-
tions.

846 Maequarie-street North, Sydney,
October 18, 1893,
My Dear Moorabinda—
The Military Tournament—taking up three
days and nights last week at Sydney Agricultural
Ground—was largely a success, and as everybody
paid to go in (my complimentary ticket was
refused by Cerberus, so, I suppose, other invites
fared similarly), there ought to be something over
for the hospital hat, although expenses were
heavy.
I went twice to the jousts—on the first and on
the last day—and was deeply entertained and
deafened on both occasions. The horses impressed
me as much as the men, for they galloped straight
into firing-parties, and no amount of gunpowder
made them swerve. I have never seen such bid-
able gee-gees outside a circus. What the far-
reaching programme really consisted of I haven’t
a notion, but as it was open to everybody in a
uniform (barring the Salvation Army), the entries
were legion, and there was no mistaking the popu-
larity and movement of the thing.
There seemed a good show of washing at
the Tournament, where, on Saturday, sum-
mer frocks of the sort that will face the
tub were largely in evidence. Mrs. “ Jack ”
Purves wore an imported dress of spring-green
figured silk that became her figure tremendously.
Miss M'Donough sported a pale-green-and-pink
shot silk with a Parisian flower-trimmed hat; a
millionairess was simply attired in a draggled
white muslin gown—the sort of thing a girl with
half-a-crown a week pin-money endeavours to
“ get homo ” on. I was grieved to see a really
pretty girl with a farcical amount of Bloom of
Youth or something on her face; it turned her
into a lovely heliotrope in the sunlight. With
Madame Ruppert still on deck in Sydney Strand
no woman who wants to give Nature a hint may
be excused for turning out such a hideous impro-
bability. A dress that rather amused me was an
all-white robe with big black satin sleeves and two
bars of black round the skirts. It reminded you
of the nigger in the soap-advt. who is gradually
washing himself white.
There was a boxing-match, I remember, between
a man in Home Rule trouserlets and another with
a red scarf worn in a most original position,
whose “second” filled his mouth with water and
spirted it over his “ man ” in the way that China-
men are alleged to moisten pastry ! What ought
to have been billed as a comic encounter was a
hero in a kilt, and his head in what looked like a
meat-safe, trying deliberately to spit a fellow-
creature on horseback with his bayonet. It
reminded me of Lauri toasting a herring in the
“Old Guard,” and the “Victoria Cross’’act—
mounted men rescuing dummies by one leg under
a heavy fire and over hurdles—was extremely
amusing. If dummy had been a genuine wounded
hero I’m afraid he would have questioned the
right of any man to thus save him even from
death.
By the way, I wonder why more people don’t
drive to any amusement like the tournament
instead of sitting on a badly-placed grand-stand,
commanding but one arena? At an open-air
show where everything happens at once, driving
or riding is the best way to go if you go to see.
Competitors from Victoria and Queensland were
in the lists, but I must confess to not knowing
t’other from which*—the Australian army is
dressed in the hue of a dead gum-leaf all along
the line, and one hero is as sartorially like another
as Ah Sin is to Ah Pong. Taking it altogether,
the tournament was a success, although the details
were rather neglected. For instance, some of the
horses were shockingly turned-out, and com-
petitors who were “off” for the time being rode
along doubled up and puffing dingy pipes as
though military smartness was only expected from
them in the arena.
Sydney D.T.’s bachelor-tax contention is rapidly
b ;aring fruit. Two youths advertise in the agony-
column, asking for an appointment with “Ethel”
and “Lilian,” and as the whole business is taper-
ing off into “Is Marriage a failure?” the D.T.
will have to start a matrimonial bureau.
Seriously, though, how would it do to have a
“matrimonial column” in the D.T., and a
“ matrimoni vl, etcetera,” column in the Evening
News? There is a great deal of etcetera in the
News already.
Some very irregular suggestions are tolerated in
the discussion. For instance, “Don Juan”
wants to be recommended to a suitable partner,
“one who would not object to life in the country
with a bachelor of twenty-eight 1” Also, a “bache-
—— _ e
lor of 29,” encloses his card to the editor in cas
he should know of a nice, pursey-girl in want of
a legal protector, and a lady (“ Lilian ”) at once
comprehensively responds.
“ Lilian ” (who is twenty-six, if you like to be-
lieve it, and wants a sincere lover_ who will
develops into a sincere Darby) explains, in one
simple sentence, why she is withering on her stem.
“ I have received a good education, with music
and other incidentals ” —which somehow gives you
the idea of puckered crewel-work, and a notion of
saying “nong” and “ moossoo set proudly
forth in the same way that the house-mother dusts
the stand of useless stuffed parrots, and puts it
where the world can look in and see it.
The information given by one woman corres-
pondent—that hundreds of spinsters, with a little
cash, are on the lookout for husbands —suggests an
idea. Supposing anybody as fatally-fascinating
as, say, llyley, advertised his willingness to marry
beauty and cash, the answers would roll in like
coupons in The Bulletin’s Missing Word com-
petition. That is what really every lovely “ pro."
should do ere his fatal beauty fades. The bachelor
(or poor and married) pro. who has got to be fat
and forty is as sad and insignificant an object as
the now un-uniformed captain of the big ocean
liner who has been dismissed his ship.
They are trying to “ put a head ” on the Sydney
Woman Suffrage League, i.e., they nominated
possible presidents at a meeting the other evening
to fill the place of the titled lady who left in a
state of speechless indignation not long ago. The
amusing thing about the nominations was that
Miss So-and-So proposed Mrs. Asterisk; Mrs.
Dash stood sponsor for Mrs. Minerva; but Mr.
Blank’s nomination was—-Mrs. Blank! And yet
some people maintain that woman sans the suf-
frage is a voiceless slave !
Only one fiasco signalised the last concert held
by Sydney Banjo-Guitar-and-Mandoline Society
at the Centenary Hall. A blonde fiddler was
given a bouquet to hand to a lady, and mixed the
situation by giving the roses to the wrong girl!
But any man would rather sit on a safety-valve
than tell a woman the applause wasn’t meant for
her, so the unhappy youth repaired his error by
offering up a floral basket at his own expense,
instead of explaining the vegetables back again.
The concert was an improvement on the society’s
last attempt, and, save the overforceful methods of
the conductor, there was little to irritate. The
society plays butterfly bits like the “ Immer
Weider ’’Gavotte, “La Harpe HColienne,” and
the Sylvia ballet music with much volume, and
the era has passed when its combined (fforts
sounded like a stick rattling on a tin-fence. Its
dressing is interesting, too —it is every girl for
herself, and no embargo put on everything but
neutral tints as most societies do. Of course, you
run the risk of somebody coming in a sea-blue
Empire frock, covered voluminously with tan
mosquito net —thus producing the effect of a blue
groper caught in a coffee-strainer, and there is a
hazard of a woman coming out in crude scarlet
like a bull-fighter, but I always prefer a flower-
bed stage to a uniform one, however the colours
swear at each other. Miss Llewellyn, Miss Gray
and Mr. Deane vocally assisted the guitarists, and
Edgar Straus exercised his ’cello to the delight of
a fairly large audience.
Nellie Stewart (with whom I had a chat the
other morning) attributes her increased plumpness
to “living on cream and butter with Marion Bur-
ton in Devonshire.’’ Marion, it appears, has also
put on condition, and imagination reels at the
idea of how those historic pale-grey tights would
look now. I don’t think Nellie Stewart, seen in
full daylight, has changed a single dimple (there
is a story told, by the way, of one Australian
songstress who sought a medico to know if he
could manufacture a dimple “by cutting some-
thing ”), except that she looks “fitter” than when
she left us—rather hollowed-out with continuous
effort, if you remember—three years ago. Nellie
was glad that she re-appeared first in Sydney,
“ where I belong ’’ —although she professes that
she hasn’t done the Block yet. One particularly
pleasant thing about Miss Stewart is that,
although she’s been “ ’Ome,” her language is still
intelligible—she doesn’t tell you that she is
“ reahlly gled to see deah Orsetrailyah agen,
dontcherkno w. ”
I was sorry to hear that Nellie means to forsake
us in eight months’ time to have another try for
British laurels, although the English climate
doesn’t agree with her. It is interesting to be
told that she partly blames her Australian wor-
shippers for her bad luck in London. “ You
spoilt me, you know ; and in London poor Cellier
would fling music I was studying across the room,
telling me to refuse to sing it—and you have heard
the result. However, I think the adverse experi-
ence has been useful to me.” It seems odd that
when Miss Stewart was rehearsing last week for
“Mikado” she found she had totally forgotten
the business. “I couldn’t even remember the
wave of a fan—but, then, all my old parts seem
new to me now.”
There was nothing new about thei.way they
dressed the “ Mikado ” at Sydney Lyceum on
Saturday. The girls all toddled about with pack-
saddle bows on, and four inches of paint. The
artless way they stuck three pins in their hair,
presented the wards of Ko-Ko in a very Pick-
wickian light. Nellie Stewart, who wears her
garments the shortest of all—but then she once
told me she doesn’t mind how much ankle an
actress shows —it’s topside revelations she worries
about—sported the most expensive robe —a very
Japanese thing in cream silk, brocaded in
coloured ’mums and gold cobwebs, the pack-
saddle and linings of gold-coloured silk. As
that was the prima-donna’s only array it was just
as well to do it handsomely.
The “Mikado” he-aotors weigh-in well sar-
torially with their rich coats (Vernon sports some-
thing very special in ruby velvet with golden
geese embroidered on it and a foot deep), and
Solomon would probably cross the street if he met
one of them—but at the same time we have
admired those draggling garments very often.
The shortness of breath we once felt when
the “Mikado” turned his black-and-gold back—
like a drawing-room screen—full on to the audience
has passed away with custom, and you almost
wish he were a twopenny chintz for a change.
There was a large and glittering audience on the
first night.
There is a lady of Titipu who frankly admits
she doesn’t wear her best gown to Govmentouse —
not since the first time, when she wore a very
special peach-colour brocade and sat on a chair
just gilded, with the result that her back bore the
impression of a golden gridiron.
The latest orange-blossom rumour about a very,
very wealthy spinster is that a relative will carry
off the matrimonial stakes. He already ’bides in
the house, and fetches and carries beyootifully.
Miss Maud Fitz-Stubbs’s “ Heather ” waltz,
which has achieved such success in Sydney, where
military bands and orchestras have it scored, gets
much praise from Hobart journals, which speak of
its “persuasive prettiness,” “dash,” and so* on.
It is selling freely in Hobart, and is proving
its right to the position of the waltz of the season.
But feeble musicians shouldn’t attempt to play it,
for it is difficult as well as dashing.
A “Necktie and Apron Dance” takes place at
Paddington Town Hall to-night (Thursday) in aid
of the Paddington Relief Society. Gov. and
Lady Duff extend their patronage, and double
tickets are five shillings—to be obtained at the
doors. I must confess that the title, “Necktie
and Apron,” rather alarms me. Will the guests
be restricted to those two articles of apparel ?
Honesty, really, is the best policy some-
times, For instance, I am told that as the
treasurer of Sydney’s principal theatre was
airing himself on the mat one warm even-
ing last week a seedy-looking man stepped
briskly up to him and said—not the usual
“Lemme a penny, sir, I’m starvin’,” but lowered
his voice to a confidential pitch and said per-
suasively, “I say, do give me the price of a
whisky-and-soda.” And “Goody”—fascinated
by the novelty of the thing—rendered tribute
accordingly. However, it is understood that the
Good manic whisky-and-soda list is now absolutely
suspended, the press alone excepted.
The latest notion emanating from Govt, House,
Sydney, is a Zoo party when the social lions tickle
the other sort with canes and parasols, and the
proceedings wind up with tea and trimmings.
Captain Feilding—the latest A.D.C. —(an im-
proved version of “Chumley ”) gave one the other
day, and if this mild excitement is a stepping-
stone to Aquarium parties and Wax work parties and
Cyolorama parties, the sixpenny-shows are going
to have halcyon days presently.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

There is a great sameness about the Ameri-
can gold-mining drama, but “ Forty-nine,” now
on view at Sydney Royal, while possessing all the
old familiar features, has some good ones of its
own. Maggie Moore, as the wild girl of the moun-
tains, is a refreshing spectacle. She is a very
large girl, so that there is plenty of her for the
money, and her singing-voice is in excellent repair,
and so is her weeping-voice when her adopted
mother trails her around by the hair, and her dancing
takes the gallery by storm. Further, there is
room for much comedy in the part, and though
other comedy-actresses have come and gone, no
one of them all has ever equalled Maggie
Moore in her own line. Mr. J. P. West
does some unusually good work as old “Forty-
nine,” the digger of perpetual ill-fortune,
who lives on coon, among some of the
grandest scenery ever built to contain that un-
savoury animal. The rest of the drama consists
entirely of Harry Leston. Leston is a comedian
of no mean order at all times, and his General,
regarded as the ruins of a noble Roman drunk of
many years standing, is in every way commend-
able. Concerning Mr. Cosgrove, this paper wishes
to place it on record that he is the most indefinite-
looking person it ever saw or heard of, and the
sketchiness of his aspect is a weariness. “ Forty-
nine ” is adorned with some fine mountain land-
scapes, and there is as little drink and shooting in
it as any Californian drama can get through with.
Even the intended hanging of Mr. West doesn’t
come off. The play is drawing larger audiences
than the Royal has seen for a long time, neverthe-
less the management proposes a new piece this
Saturday.

The new version of the “ Hansom Cab,’ r
staged on Saturday at Sydney Her Majesty’s, is
an improvement in some few respects upon various
of its predecessors. Mr. H. R. Roberts, as the
Irish hero, is beautiful to gaze upon, and when he
hugs Hilda Spong he hugs her so conscientiously
that his remarks seem to be smothered by her
back-hair getting into his mouth, and when he
kisses her there is a loud-resounding smack. He
is an accomplished huggist and a lovely fashion-
plate and hair-dresser’s advertisement. His teeth
when he smiles are like the white flower of a
blameless life, and his O’Connorian brogue is
sustained and convincing.

Mother Guttersnipe, as done by Miss
Kate Bishop, is a truly artistic triumph—a piece
of acting on which Miss Bishop might travel the
world, and which should be missed by nobody.
There are three generations of women in a garret
—one ancient, dirty, indignant and drunk, one
faded and dying, and the third ragged, hungry
and pathetic, and they make among them a high-
class temperance moral lesson. The lesson, how-
ever, is mostly concentrated in the old woman,
who, with her curses, her empty bottle, her dis-
hevelled hair, her boot-aimings at the head of her
affrighted grand daughter, and her hideous visions,
is a noble work of art. Misses Hilda Spong
and Polly Emery and Messrs. Forde and Norman
fill four other parts respectably, but Joe Tolano’s
blatant detective is sufficient (like the average
detective of real life —the one who stands at the
Australia bar talking loudly and flourishing a
huge note-book) to scare away a criminal at a
mile’s range; and Miss Vivienne’s dying female
is as contrary to the teachings of medical experi-
ence as was the dying Lady Isabel of Lilia Wilde.
Also J. W. Sweeney is a little less convincing
than usual for want of his customary police or
priestly uniform. The drama keeps up a reason-
ably coherent aspect till near the end, when the
murderer, for want of a better expedient, is
weakly bowled out owing to the unsupported
statements of a somnambulist. Ih‘ n he is
arrested and put into another hansom c ab.

Walter Bentley’s benefit perfo; n.anoc-, in
aid of the Thirlmere Home for Consumptive,
eventuated on Thursday night, at Sjdney Cri-
terion, and realised .£lOO and sundry shillings fur
a really deserving institution. “Da\ id Garrick ”
and the “Silent Woman” formed the bill, the
latter comedy being partly supported by the lovely
Captain Rupert Leigh, over whom the wide
mantle of charity is hereby drawn. During an
interval an unauthorised kind of person, one Mr.
Oonsett Stephen, appeared before the curtain and
made some remarks expressive of thankfulness.
Nobody inSydneycan remember any public or semi-
public occasion—hangings only excepted—when
somebody named Stephen has not been in evidence
and made a speech, and therefore the incident was
not surprising. Also, Mr. Bentley delivered an
oration in the course of which he remarked that
he was going away, probably for ever, but that he
wanted to be kept in affectionate remembrance.
Which remark, considering that Mr. Bentley has
always been a purely business transaction, was
somewhat irrelevant.
** * *
A six-nights revival of “The Mikado,” at
Sydney Lyceum, presented that humorous and
lingering potentate in a somewhat piebald aspect
—where he was good he was very good indeed,
but where he was bad he was horrid. The
dimpled Nellie Stewart, as Yum-Yurn, carried too
much black hair for her small and oval face, and her
colour in the first act wassomewhat too ripe (though
quite correct, probably, f rom a J apanese standpoint)
to be strictly beautiful to the Australian eye ;
otherwise she more than filled the bill. Her
voice sounded as clear as crystal in the “Moon ”
solo—a most dainty bit of work—warmly encored
and flower-pelted. Tapley, seen for the first
time in the abbreviated tunic of Nanki Poo, had
painted himself too pink for a liver-coloured Jap,
but he is undoubtedly the cleverest Nanki-Poo
of the lot, although he left out the ascending
notes in “Here’s a how de do,” which Bracy
invariably tackled.

Howard Vernon, in his familiar part of
Ko Ko, got much palm-tribute for the “ Little
List ” song, the locally-built encore verses, especi-
ally the one embalming “the advertising lady,”
would kind gentleman assist ? ” being re-demanded
in a way that looked as if Gilbert wasn’t in it
with local “ potes.” Vernon’s facial make-up was
perfect, miles more artistic than Ryley’s over-
grotesque face, evidently taken from a toy-shop
Joss. Ryley, by the way, becomes a bore in pro-
portion to the “society”strength of the audience.
Violet Varley, Nina Osborne, Mrs. Bracy, Rose-
vear (as The Mikado—but who would hope to
play it after Alan Morris ?), and Grundy were the
rest of the people with more or less success; and
Amy Leyton, garlanded like a prize ox, sand-
wiched her whirling rainbowrdance between the
acts. “La Masootte,” with Courtneidge added
to the cast, starts on a fortnight’s run this
(Saturday) night.

The new young lessee with the curly
moustache proved unequal to the strain of Mel-
bourne Royal, so that sorely-afflicted place of
■entertainment closed again during the middle of
last week. It was not an aggressive closing, and
nobody can say exactly when the event took place.
Properly speaking, the house ceased to remain
open. The curtain left off rising, the orchestra
dried up, the doorkeepers slunk silently away
and the “ Heart of Midlothian ” refused to beat
any more. The young lady who had dreamed of
Julieting to the lessee’s Romeo, awoke suddenly
to the stern reality of professional life, and her
fair champions on the press reluctantly set fire to
the splendid notices they had written in advance.
** * *
“ Hans the Boatman ” has pulled his
hardest against the stream at Melbourne Bijou,
without making much headway. A drama that
depends largely on a big dog, and a child who
sucks milk from a feeding-bottle, is a precarious
means of livelihood. Sometimes it “takes,’’but
sometimes it doesn’t—the latter alternative being
on top for the time being. This was no excuse,
all the same, for an unknown marauder’s descent
upon the first night’s takings. A ruffian, with the
instincts of Barabbas and a thorough knowledge
of the premises, started the Thornton-Arnold
season by sneaking the till, and it will be as well
for the future to let the dog roost in the safe. On
Saturday, a revival of “The Private Secretary
should give the new company a little more scope
for action. Thornton appears once more as the
hunted shepherd, and business-manager Harwood
resumes his particular character of the truculent
uncle around whose liver the comedy revolves.
** * *
At Melb. Princess’ there was another good
house for “Pagliacci” last Saturday. Leon-
cavallo’s music, although not so always catchy as
the airs of “ Cavalleria,” has come to be equally
appreciated, whilst the performance is improved
by the extravagances of harlequin Frasca. The

A respected old identity like Dick Stewart might, one

an equal-to-new production. The main obstacle in the
way of any such scheme is the miserable professional
jealousy which causes Binks to turn green at the thought
of playing a supernumerary part whilst Jinks (down for
the same salary as himself) is "starring” in the fore-
ground. But for this eternal craving for “ lines,”
“situations” and “good notices ” we might see an
aitisiio commonwealth show established, with trained
actors and actresses forming the “crowd,” or taking
leading parts, just as seemed best suited to circumstances.

The Wild-Cat Column.
The recent trouble between the Melbourne wool-
buyers and selling-brokers is an eloquent commentary on
the present rottenness of Victoria. The old-established
trade-rule is that all goods shall be removed by buyer
within six days after purchase, and shall be paid for in
cash before delivery. “Cash,” however, is an elastic
term, and hitherto a crossed cheque has always been
accepted. The trouble arose out of the discovery that
crossed cheques, nowadays, are not always so good as they
used to be, therefore the brokers demanded that each pur-
chaser should fetch round legal tender ere taking away
his wool, and the buyers resented this as an insult.
After a week’s deadlock, however, a compromise
was effected. The buyer is to hand over his cheque as
heretofore. The broker is to take it, with the air of a
man who hasn’t the least suspicion of his customer’s sol-
vency, only there is to be a delay of a few minutes before
he hands over the delivery-order, so that he can send
round in hot haste to the bank and ascertain if the cheque
is good. Meanwhile, it is to be understood by both par-
ties that the delay is purely accidental, and the fact that
the cheque has been sent round to the bank is to be
entirely ignored.

The quarterly returns of the Vic. Banks show
a general contraction in advances, evidencing the fact that

there having been an all-round decrease in deposits,
except in the Royal and N.Z. The decrease in the
other non - reconstructed banks is most noticeable
in the cases of the Australasia and N.S.W. The
proportion of cash to liabilities shows a return to sounder
finance, the N.Z. still holding first, and the Colonial, as
usual, last place. The note-issue has fallen about 20 per
cent., showing what bimetallists term “the appreciation

Matthew Davies’ private accountant having
been put into the witness-box to give formal evidence for
the Mercantile Bank prosecution, was naturally the sub-
ject of a very long and very friendly cross-examination by
his former “ boss.” The private accountant’s disclosures
were seldom to the point, but in an irrelevant manner
they proved interesting. He dwelt impressively on the
facts that Mat. Davies always paid for shares in his little
companies with “ his own money,” and never let a month
go by without asking for a correct statement of his wealth
to be made out. Furthermore, the private accountant
was convinced cl Matthew’s belief in the stability of
every institution, even after it had shut up, but seeing
that the aforesaid belief was founded on faith in the ever-
lasting flow of “ public confidence,” it was practically a
blind trust in the efficacy of balance-sheet bunkum. When,
at last, the defendant K.C.M.G. asked his private ac-
countant whether other banks hadn’t closed in a Meroan-
tiley manner without getting the directors into trouble,
that faithful servant replied “ Yes, Sir Matthew',” with
much unction. Nor did the Bench object to this wildly
humorous suggestion that two blacks necessarily make
a white.

To prove the connection of Matthew Davies
with his “ tentacle ” banks, it is necessary, seemingly, to
put the various liquidators into the box. Thus the w'orld
is reminded that Matthew’s private accountant is
liquidating the Gascoigne Company, and Matthew’s
brother-in-law is liquidating the Vic. Mortgage and
Deposit Bank, but at the same time it enables
Matthew’s relatives and adherents to pour forth a
flood of irrelevant belief in Matthew’s innocence at
Matthew’s bidding, and causes the case to stand still for
hours at a stretch. When the liquidator happens
to be a stranger, as in the case of the E. and A.
Mortgage Bank, the cross-examination is not unduly pro-
longed. Matthew ventured to ask Mr. Kaye, from
London, whether the stoppage of a bank was any proof of
its insolvency, and the reply was not at all favourable.
“Hadn’t the Melbourne Permanent Building Society
been forced to suspend payment, and wasn’t it
now a going and a flourishing concern ? ” asked
Matthew. The unsympathetic witness from London
answered that the society mentioned was going, but
he didn’t know anything about its flourishing, so
Matthew gave him up as a bad job. The question was
rather a reckless one, considering that the M.P.B.S. had
Just previously announced by circular its urgent need of
a new scheme for meeting liabilities.

“It has not been unusual for banks to close
after declaring dividends, and yet you have heard of no
charges of issuing false balance-sheets in those cases ?”
enquires Matthew Davies. The Bulletin has heard of a
Melb. bank being sued for issuing false returns, and of
the settlement of that case being kept a dark secret by
the press. However, if Davies doesn’t mean to be prose-
cuted without demanding the prosecution of other
people, there are lots of banks and companies he can call
attention to.

How the British investor is got at. A certain
company was formed for the purpose of buying and sell-
ing land. The directors, desiring to benefit others, floated
a new 00., and sold all the first oo.’s properties to it, and
advanced the purchase money by way of mortgage, not a
Denny passing in the transaction. Then the first co. had
its articles of association altered (and its name changed)
to preclude it from doing other than a mortgage business
and receiving deposits. TheboardadvertisedintheEnglish
papers that the co. did solely a mortgage business ; the
money came in fast enough and was lent to the directors
and their friends. Then the crash came, and the de-
positors wanted their money, and now find out the mean-

astonishment all they would give was a little over £2OO.
They must have made treble that out of my 30 years' pay-
ments. It is just here the law should compel the 00. to
give a fair value for the surrendered policy. “Insurance”
evidently makes no allowance for the fact that he has got
30 years' protection from the company, and that is a com-

The new A.J.S. Bank has already wiped off
£1,202,857 of the liability of the old bank, about £716,000
of this amount being deposits repaid. All the money at
current account has been liberated, and a large amount of
the note circulation paid off. Also, the bank has wisely
decided to close up 26 small branches and agencies which
were maintained at a loss in one-horse townships, partly
out of a frantic desire to “extend the business,” and
partly because the A.J.S. and the Commercial of Sydney
used each to be filled with a bitter resolve to open a
branch in perdition sooner than let the other institution
get ahead. Now that they both show signs of abandon-
ing this rivalry there is a much better prospect for
all parties concerned.

That baby bank, the Royal of Australia, pub-
lishes a little balance-sheet which looks like the Union’s
balance viewed through an inverted telescope. The paid-
up capital is £300,000, and the profits for the half-year
are £l9Ol. This, added to £5169, brought forward from
previous years, makes £7070 available. There is no
dividend, and the bank carries its little surplus forward.
The “ bills receivable and advances ” are £482,713, and the
total liabilities to the public a trifle under £307,000. The
Royal is just five years old, and up till quite recently no
one took it seriously ; it looked so small among the huge
boom institutions that it was regarded rather as a comic
bank which existed for the mere amusement of the thing.
But when every other purely Victorian bank burst in
the panic, and the little brother of the family survived
and seemed none the worse for the troubles all around,
people began, for the first time, to have a certain respect
for it, and they have kept on respecting it ever since.

Dear Bulletin,—The gold that is being got at
Bayley’s original reward claim (near Coolgardie, W.A.)
is incredible to all but those who see the mine for them.
Selves. The deeper the workers go the richer they find
the ground, whether in the underlie or the shaft or ths
trench. From the latter, last week, 200 oz. of lumpy
slugs of quartz gold .was obtained. As the well deepens
the volume of water increases; by condensation, only a
slight trace of salt remains. Owing to want of capital,
but few reefs at Coolgardie are being worked ; these give
better indications the more deeply they are penetrated.
There is not much alluvial at Coolgardie ; nevertheless,
a few goodly-sized slugs are picked up occasionally. I
saw a 25-oz. nugget picked up yesterday by
Bill Bennett; diggers, though, ought not to come
here on such odd chances. Some men are leaving Cool-
gardie, but more are arriving. Water is 9d. per gallon ;
bread, Is. the 21b. loaf; mutton, 9d. per lb. The field
is overstocked with flour. The last teamster sold
flour at 14s. per 501 b.-bag ; oatmeal, 2s. 6d. per 71b.-bag.
These prices allowed for a freight of £5O per ton by the
line vih Narrogin. Goods are now also taken by the rail-
way contractors as far as Doodelikin, 91 miles from the
Cross. This should reduce the cost of freight. The
Government has at last sent a body of able men to try and
provide the field with a constant supply of water, which
is getting scarce, rain not having fallen for a long time.
Good alluvial gold is being got at Hainan's, and at Rei-
son’s some are getting from 2oz. to 3oz. per week, but
many hundreds are hardly making tucker. The water is
getting bad there, too. I heard of a big rush about 30
miles west of that, but, so far, it has justified no hopes.
Ned R shot himself dead on the track back, 40 miles
from Coolgardie ; he had 3Joz. of gold on him and a bank-
ing account.—Yours, Miner. Coolgardie (W.A.), Sep

heads; when completed there was nothing to crush—

The great diamond lately found in Jagersfontein
mine, Orange Free State, will, when cut, be twice the size
of the De Beer’s diamond. In colour it is blue-white, and
weighs just over 970 carats—beating the De Beer’s stone
by 542 carats. It is expected to cut about 600 carats, and
will, in size, shape and purity, excel any other diamond.

The S.M. Herald interviewer makes out
the new U.S. Consul Bell to be a modest kind of
a man. “ What is your opinion of the Vancouver

“They seem to be on the way to prosperity.
'They treated me well.”
The swinish Carter's attack on Victorian
ex-Premier Shiels, when he charged him with
marrying a rich wife and “ loafing on her money,”
has reminded people of several things which were
in a fair way to be forgotten. A lecture by Shiels
on some episodes in Carter’s troubled existence
would “ take well ” now.
It is related that when S.A. Chief Justice
Way is about to give a social entertainment he

“ Now, which is it, guest or caterer ? Not both.”
To the everlasting honour of the latter be it stated
that he usually chooses the less distinguished but

Le Souef, director of Melb. Zoo, gained
his position by previous experience, having been
usher of the Vic. Upper House. He proposes that
Melb. fashionables should hold a weekly gathering

G. T. Blantern, the condemned murderer

author of a maudlin sermon to young men
to beware of drink, is “well-connected” in
England, and a year or two ago squandered,
around Gyrnpie and Maryborough, a remittance
of .£1,500 in the usual “ c:ime-and-pluck-me,-I’m-
a-pigeon ” style. He next uttered a valueless
cheque, for which he was punished, but only
under the First Offences Probation Act. Then he
forged a hotelkeeper’s name to another cheque,
and a warrant was out for his arrest at the time
when he chopped up the girl who wouldn’t love
him.

There are two ex-detectives on the Bench
which is hearing the charges against Matthew
Davies, Millidge and others. C. H. Nicholson,
the P.M., rose from the detective ranks to become
superintendent of detectives. The other ex-

An Australian cleric, some years ago, being
then in charge of a church at £l5O a year, put his
godly savings into Broken Hills. The Lord blessed
the investment, and told him to sell at the top ;
result, about £50,000. Then came a voice which
advised him to invest in beer, but it was the voice
of the Devil. The parson is now clerk at 30s. a
week in what was once his own brewery.
“ Jack ” Want’s Telegraphic Messages Bil*
was taken in N.S.W. Assembly, the other night,
to presage the entrance of that political petrel on
the stormy scene of daily journalism. Two or three
men, “who know exactly the sort of paper that
would take with the public,” approached the bar-
rister before noon of next day to tap gently in
search of capital, but success was not there.
The lately-deceased Edward Squire, de-
puty - Postmaster - General, &c., S.A., by the
accident which killed him just escaped, according
to those who assume to know the intentions of the
Kingston Government, being promoted into the
shqes of the ennobbled punster, Todd. Squires had
an Adelaide “ double,” and, for some days after
his death, the latter was several times mistaken
for Squire’s ghost.
That enlightened clergyman, Rev. Peter
Menzies, who was as boiling-water on an ant-hill
in Melb. Presbyterianry, had an absolute hatred
of the doctrine of Original Sin. One day he
pointed to his two pretty little daughters and
said to some Rev. Malagrowther Mulligatawny,
“Do you mean to tell me, sir, that they are
drenched in iniquity? No, they are fresh, pure
and beautiful, from the hand of God.”
The Age :
When Archbishop Carr treats Bishop Goe’s claim to
coequal rank with him in the hierarchical world as a joke,
he forgets that he owes his own status to the only piece
of pleasantry that lightens up the sad and joyless Record
of their common Master, and that but for the temptation
to play on the words Petros and Petra, he might at this
moment he teaching their knee-drill to the recruits of
the Salvation Army, with General Booth for his com-
mander in the place of Pope Leo XIII.
There has been in Pentridge Prison, for
the last 20 years, a commercial traveller named
Husler (a “Governor’s pleasure” man), who killed
bis wife at Richmond, but was acquitted on the
ground of insanity. Since then, the Judge who
tried him- and the three counsel who defended
him—M. A. Maodonnell, James Fullerton and
W. A. Moore—are all dead. “Willie” Moore
said that to his mind Husler’s insanity was proved
by his selection of his lawyers at trial.
Col. Finniss, first Premier of S A. under
responsible Government, is a tolerably seasoned
Australian. Boyle Travers Finniss was born at
sea on board the East Indiaman Warley, on
August 18, 1807, his parents hailing from Kent
(Eng.). He served in the British army as ensign
(56th Regt.) from ’25 to '35, when he sold his com-
mission, with the intention of going to N.S.W. as
a military settler, but, instead, proceeded to S._A.
in ’36, and helped Colonel Light to lay out the city
of Adelaide. He was made Deputy-Surveyor-
General in ’4O, became P.M. in_’43, followed
the intrepid Colonel Sturt as Registrar-General
in ’47, was gazetted Colonial Secretary in ’52,
was Acting-Governor from Dec. ’54 to June ’55,
and was afterwards chosen as Premier under the
new Constitution Act, but did nob retain office

dent of the Northern Territory in ’64, and now

The lately-deceased Dr. Ward, of Mary-
borough (Q.) —the man whose obituary was written
10 years before by a local paper on a false alarm—
was a tough “life,” and reckless in hisj'habits.
He insured his life years ago, and, after running
through his property, sold his policy to two local
business men. Afterwards he used to brag—
“ They thought I’d die soon, but I was better than
either of them, for they both cleared out.” Ward’s
powers as a raconteur were for years one of the
evergreen boasts of Maryborough.
A certain Australian Judge-— not Supreme
Court —was once trying a case of forgery. The
bill-discounter had given his evidence fairly and
squarely, the Judge summed up dead against the
accused, but the jury believed the latter and
acquitted him. That very afternoon the Judge
waited upon the bill-discounter to melt his own
p.n. for £5O, explaining that the accused of the
morning did not escape through any fault of his
(the Judge). The p.n. was not “done.” For-
tunately, Australia has had few such Judges.
The Spectator waggishly suggests the
solving of the Samoan difficulty by making R. L.
Stevenson King of Samoa, and notes among his
other qualifications for the billet the fact of his
having an American wife. No one-wife man is
going to placate Samoa. Steinberger had about
37 political wives, and he couldn’t do it, although
he was a born fighter and spent more money there
every week among natives than R.L.S. does in
three years. The idea of a white king would be
laughed at by the Samoans, from Malietoa down

your time in contrition and sorrow for the rash and
wrong thing which you have committed. I would also
encourage yon to keep up your heart, and, when you

a support to your mother. Because you are in gaol, you
need not lose your self-respect. . . . Keep yourself as
much as possible to yourself and preserve your self-
respect, for you know you are not a thief, you are not a
burglar, nora low, dishonest man. Be a comfort to your
mother and in the end you will be happy.
Insolvent James Mimro obtained his
“release,” a while back, under circumstances not
at all properly reported in the Melb. papers.
Objecting solicitor Godfrey had carelessly assumed
that he would be able to examine Mr. Munro
at the last minute, and show cause why the
venerable gentleman should not be quitted of all
his liabilities on payment of a plausible sixpence
in the £. Finding that he couldn’t put James
through his facings there and then, Godfrey asked
for the “release” to be held over until he
(Godfrey) could obtain an examination order.
However, Judge Molesworth disposed of the
matter right away with a few sympathetic
remarks to the effect that he was rejoiced to grant
a certif. to a gentleman whose misfortunes were
evidently the result of a run of “singularly bad
luck.” The Bulletin trusts that the Judge has
studied the latest Federal Bank revelations.

POLITICAL POINTS
Twopenny postage to continue in Yic.

Parkes is not dead sure of St. Leonards,
and Dibbs has at present no constituency wherein
to find certain rest for his foot.
The “Freetrade” Argus is in favour of
bonuses to foster local industries.
The Age favoured a land-tax at Budget-
time, but now regards it as an unholy thing—
which the Argus duly notes and scores off.
Rumoured that a certain M.P., who lately
brought down the Vic. House by his unexpected
and eloquent harangue, is to be sued by the writer
of said harangue for the costs of its preparation.
Premier M‘ llwraith (Q.) some time ago
refused to carry on the Govt, by the Speaker’s
casting-vote. He is getting quite used to doing so
now.
There is one Freetrader, anyhow, in Yic.
Parliament. Colonel Templeton has got in for
Benalla by the casting-vote of the returning-
officer.

Hearing Australian politicians talking
glibly of “keeping off the London money market,”
and then, on the first opportunity, rushing there,
reminds one of the confirmed drunkard’s eternal
winning promise “ not to touch it again.”
Parkes is the monte-man in N.S.W. poli-
tics. “’Ere y’are, gents, pick out the lovely lady

The Q. Council wanted to make the village

Now, the last Q. loan was floated to “ relieve” the

The proposed Adelaide Labour evening
paper has collapsed. It was to have been run on
the One-man-one-vote principle, but “ this re-
striction, it is said, prevented even enthusiastic
Democrats from applying for more than one share
apiece.”
By an arbitrary repeal of the Stamp Act,
the MTI wraith Executive lias saved the three Q.

“Dick” Stevenson, M.P. for Wollombi

creased to £2150 without the knowledge of Parlia-
ment. Last week, The Bulletin hears, a further
<£l2o per annum was tagged on to Mr. Greer’s
screw, which is now £2s7o—apart from travelling
expenses, &o.
“Glenlnnes”
Hutchison, in
N.S.W. Assem-
bly, insisted upon
“the uncondi-
tional withdraw-
al ” by P ar kes,
sen., “of the
whole expression”
—“the bald-head-
ed philosopher
from Glen Innes.’»
Parkes recklessly
withdrew all of
it. Yet Hutchison
is bald - headed,
hails representa-
tively from Glen
Innes, and is not
a philosopher.
Which proves how
difficult it is to
“ withdraw ” one
class of sneers.
Theannounced
decision of N.S.
Wales Govt, to
reduce the num-
ber of police-
magistrates, as far
as practicable, will
please nobody ac-
quainted with the
wholesale and
naked corruption
of the honorary-
J.P. system.
Cheap justice-how
nasty thou art! See
the blushlessly-
packed honorary
Melb. benches of
to-day ! And how
shameless were
the deeds of the
packed Sydney
honorary benches
of a dozen years
ago! As those Mel-
bourne benches
are, and as those
Sydney benches
were, so is, on oc-
casion, every
backblocks bench
of J.’sP.
L. W. Moles worth, M.P. for Newtown
(N.S.W.), is a Freetrader by profession, and a
Custom House agent by avocation. Every time
ho airs his fiscal creed ho blasts himself in his
working capacity—just like a Single-taxer running
a building-society.
“ With One-man-one-vote, local represen-
tation would be abolished.”— “Sugar” Dal-
rymple, (M.P.), Q. The Bulletin isn’t so sure
about that. It will wait until after the election
of the N.S.W. Mule Parliament. The alderman
is the son of the Ass.
George Thorn, M.L.A. (Q.), would give
every M.P. the right to act as a lawyer : “ those
who frame laws should know best what they
mean.” But not one member in fifty can frame
an act. The lawyers do that! They are thus at
once the framers and interpreters.
Thus calmly ’Frisco Call :
We do not care how ninny of the Japanese swarm into
Mexico and Australia, but we are not anxious to see them
enter our ports, for, were this immigration encouraged, it
would result In the same evils that have followed the
influx of the Chinese.
“We want,” says Fish, M.H.R. (M.L.),
“a half-holiday in the week in order to go out and
enjoy ourselves under God’s beautiful sky.” Fish
is such an aggressive-looking man that most people
used to think it was his sky, and this reipark
struck the House like a revelation.
Sangster, of the Yic. Seamen’s Union, in
pursuance of a new Labour crusade, has been
returned for Port Melbourne Council. Melbourne
workers are tired of the porcine councillor who
saves himself from the burden of rates by paying
labourers 3s. a day and wire-pulling for State
subsidies.
A HYBRID ANYWAY.
Mr. Barton has suggested an amendment of the Draft Federation Bill,
embodying the principle of One-man-one-vote.
Toby Barton [to N.S.W.): “As you see, he is Democratic down to the
very heels of his blucher boots.”
N.S. Wales ; “And Plutocratic up to the very crown of his Windsor hat!”
Afc last opening of Q. Parliament the
address-in-reply was seconded by M.L.A. Arm-
strong, who took M‘llwraith’s personal compli-
ments seriously. A harmless nonentity, on the
strength of it, has developed into an insipid bore.
Armstrong is of a military type physically—and
mentally.
S.M, Herald’s advocacy of the prime
importance of Federation is the offspring of
several considerations, the most operative of which
during the past month has, in the economy of the
office, been the necessity of directing the growing
sentiment for landj taxation into “ some different
channel.”
Brisbane Courier hints, in its own
stealthy fashion, that the gold robberies at Mount
Morgan and the Carcoar bank slaughter both
arose, in some unexplained fashion, from trades-
unionism and the existence of a Labour-party in
politics. It doesn’t definitely say these things, of
course, but it implies them as distinctly as it can
while leaving itself a chance to deny afterwards
that it did imply them.
It was Corfield, the Q. M.P. sent to Par-
liament by his trade-related returning-officer, and
who had been absent from the just-previous divi-
sion on an amendment, who enabled the MTI wraith
Government to secure a tie on thebetter-payment-
of-members question and call in the aid of the
Speaker’s casting-vote.
A N.S.W. M.P.’s vote on a local option
question was challenged by G. D. Clark, on the
ground that the member was personally interested
in a pub. The member happily retorted by
challenging Clark’s own vote, on the ground
that he, too, was pecuniarily interested in the
question, inasmuch as he was a salaried secretary
of a local-option organisation.
All the S.A. Ministers are middle-aged,
and as all, save Holder, are physically strong,
they are able to tire out obstructionists by long
sittings. Already the Assembly has agreed to
begin work on Thursdays at 10.30a.m., and unless
stonewalling ceases Kingston threatens to start on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays at the same hour, con-
tinuing the sittings till midnight on each occasion.
The name of Jowefcfc appears as secretary
of a movement to testimoniahse Max Hirseh, the
Victorian Freetrade apostle. Can this be the
Jowett who was secretary of the “Young Vic-
torian Patriotic League,” which, during last elec-
tion time, refused to grant Hirseh a hearing, and
referred to him as a “ miserable German
Socialist ? ”
A Maoriland parliamentary candidate re-
fused to appoint an applicant his paid canvasser,
because—
I have got no money to pay for canvassing; it is con-
trary to the Electoral Act to pay for canvassing, and even
if elected I would, if I employed you, lose my seat; and
lastly, and most important, the ladies are going to be ti e
all-important element in this contest, and to send you
round to see them would kill the Angel Gabriel’s chance.
One of the Brisbane M.L. A.’s, desirous of
exposing the inefficiency of Government inspec-
tors, said recently in the House:—“When I was
building a Government wharf at , the in-
spector passed a lot of faulty iron-work and bad
iron without a murmur.” The House roared
again, bub the legislator couldn’t for the life of
him understand what it was laughing at.
The restlessly-ambitious Piggin, of Corowa,
has returned from Sydney after a three months’ so-
journ. Piggin is, connected with squatters, and has
presumably been learning in the big smoko how to
pull the strings and get the Freetrade party, as
represented by Parkes, to father him at next
election. He’s in favour of nothing, or against
nothing. Better Hayes or Lyno even than that.
Hayes will be returned.
Speaker Bent, presenting Premier Patterson
with an oil-pamted portrait of himself, said “he
understood this demonstration was not altogether
of a political character, but had been arranged by
a number of leading citizens.” What do most of
them lead, except their own self-assertive lives?
The Irish Commissioners of Education
have removed from the Irish National school-
books eighteen articles on political economy by
Archbishop Whately. Yet, Whately’s economi-
cal theories are substantially the same as those
advanced in the higher-class school-books of Aus-
tralia.
Despite the strong
and united Demo-
cratic party support-
ing the Ministry, it
is almost hopeless to
expect anything from
the present S.A.
Assembly. The
Labour-members
have been models of
consistency, but the
Oppositionists have
corrupted several
members .elected by
radical constituencies.
One notable example
is a member, elected
by workers, who has
obstructed every
measure because
Kingston didn’t in-
clude him in his
Ministry!
Chief Justice Way
(S. A.), at recent Ade-
laide criminal ses-
sions, bullied a juror,
who pointed out that
a prisoner was un-
defended, and sug-
gested that witnesses
be ordered out of
court. Whereupon
Mr. Way observed
that prisoners were
frequently undefend-
ed, and it was like
the juror’s cheek to
suggest anything at
all, considering that
HE (Way) was on
the bench. Had
prisoner been repre-
sented by a Crown
Defender, i t would
not have been neces-
sary for a juror to
be jumped ' on by
Mr. Way in his
effort to secure jus-
tice.
With one exception, every monarchy
intrigues to overthrow every Republic. The
exception is Germany and France. Bismarck
and Caprivi have agreed in one thing only, firm
support of the French Republic—as the only card
a dynasty could play would be war with Germany,
and Germany desires peace, having everything to
lose and nothing to gain by war.
They have started morning sittings in the
S. A._ Assembly, and the other day Stonewaller
Oastine complained that the Premier and the
Treasurer had left the House to attend to their
private affairs. “ Why can’t Igo about my busi-
ness ?” he demanded fiercely. Then in eager
chorus the whole Legislature shouted : “ Oh, go,
for heaven’s sake !” Castine was so abashed that
his stonewall fell right down.
The Yic. Premier, talking to a commercial
and propertied gathering at a civic feed :
It was necessary that the people should be settled on
the land, bub it was not on that account necessary that
the houses of the people in the city should be emptied.
How to settle the people on the land and yet keep
up rents in town is Patterson’s latest difficulty.
How to run with the hare and hunt with the
hounds.
“Jack” Murray, M.P., saya that the
craving of the Victorian youth to wear uniform,
if only that of a policeman or a warder, is a
laudable one :
Gods ! no. It’s the flunkey's itch,
A vile reflex in these
Of that wad-eating spirit which
Has given us C.M. Gees !
Because the Kingston Government (S.A.)
were stubborn in retaining the Referendum, the
Assembly declined to pass the Adult Suffrage
Bill. The voting was 24 for the measure and 23
against it, but an absolute majority (or 28 -votes)
was needed to alter the Constitution. Ex-Premier
Downer and Caldwell, who has long endeavoured
to enfranchise females with property, declined to
vote. Kingston says, “ Having once put my hand
to the plough, I will never rest till the measure is
passed !”

A LOOK ROUND MELBOURNE.


Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened’at Southern Cross, Cool gar die, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will bo one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is ®b secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 309 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
j£lo each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well-known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
who will be pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

The men who speak of Victoria being “on
the mend ” ought to travel beyond the confines of
their fraud-infested Cabbage Garden and hear
about its commercial character. Then the thought
might strike them that nothing short of a revolu-
tion in Victorian public sentiment can save the
country from going utterly to rot. Whilst the
Melbourne press and its shallow political proteges
are busily engaged in trying to choke facts and
smother scandals, and are living in a fools’ para-
dise of local silence, the shame of the city is
shouted with increasing Vehemence elsewhere, and
the spiritless inhabitants in general, who ought to
be looking two or three years ahead, are mostly
wandering around in quest of a “ dead-bird ” for
the Cup.

The Bulletin’s faithful account of Lady
Hopetoun at the opera had an immediate effect.
Her ladyship brought His Ex. to “ Cavalleria ”
last Thursday night and studied the opera, not
the book, with great diligence. Likewise the
charming lady notified her intention of coming
again to hear “ Pagliacci ” on the Saturday
because she had enjoyed herself so much. Both
morning papers burst forth with paragraphs on
the subject of this vice-regal demonstration, so
that readers of The Bulletin’s scandalous re-
marks might go and observe for themselves how
untrue the story must have been. Very funny !
* * *
SOME MORE PHILOSOPHY:

With cash we might have spent now held in
boom-born banks.

In a recent issue of The Bulletin it was
announced that a certain charming violiniste was
engaged to a gentleman whose name began with
Mac. Thereupon a lady, who arrogates to herself
the proud position of mother to the fair one
alluded to, writes in the following confident
strain :
I object very much to the reference recently made to
my daughter, and shall be much obliged if you will be
good enough to have the paragraph in question contra-
dicted with as little delay as possible. The “certain
charming violiniste” is not married, nor is she likely to
be to anyone “whose name begins with Mac.’’
Apart from the fact that she is the mother of the
wrong violiniste, The Bulletin much admires the
cool confidence of its correspondent. The lady
who announces definitely whom her daughter
won’t marry, or doesn’t intend to marry, or who
is even dead sure that her daughter isn’t married
already, knows a good deal more than most ladies
do. Further, the mother who will announce, even
by implication, that nobody whose name begins
with Mac. is going to enter her family, is a
lady of uncommon pluck and resolution.
If, by any chance, her name and address
became public she would probably be rung up at
all hours of the night and day by large red Mac-
gregors with freckled knees who would want an
explanation. Also she would see a constant stream
of M‘Dougals and Mackechnies and M‘Tavishes

the statement was intended as a personal reflec-
tion. Hell has no fury like an insulted High-
lander, and if the freckled clans but get 011 her
track she will be talked to death by wild Celts m
something less than a week, or else her daughter
will have to marry the biggest Highlander of the
lot and trust to him to entice the other Scotchmen

The burglar looks for a revolver under lus
victim’s pillow just as he looks for a stone in a
plum. But in the case of a Horn finish (N.S.W.)
man the revolver-handle protruded from beneath
the pillow ; so the burglar took it and awakened
its owner by touching him on the nose with the
barrel, and then requested him to unearth his
valuables. As the burglar tied up a goodly swag
he remarked: “ I’m goin’ to keep the lovely
barker as a souvenir; you see, it only gits you
into trouble; sleepin’ with a knife between your
teeth is far ’andier and safer than a dashed pistol
under the piller.”

A lately-married Inverell (N.S. W.) man—

Up to date, the unfortunate lady had been

As a matter of fact, none of the Melbourne

A reporter applied for a billet in a Sydney
newspaper-office last week. In answer to a harm-
less question, he said : “Well, I left because the
paper was in the habit of making disparaging
allusions to Royalty. I simply don’t stand that.
I draw the line there.” And he stamped his foot
and brought his teeth together.

A newspaper-man, who supplies weekly
letters to a portion of the N.S W. country press,
lately met with a reverse which landed him for a

reached the bush destinations in correct time.

“ I have an impromptu thirst.” —The
Dipsomaniac.
A spoiled-bigamy story. A bank-
clerk in an Australian metropolis not
long ago joyfully received orders to go
and relieve a country-branch officer who
had got honeymooning leave, inasmuch as
his own fiancee lived in that country
towui. Determined on advantaging him-
self of such a snap-chance, he sent his
lady-love a cheque with which to buy her
trousseau, on the understanding that they
were to be married right off on his arrival.
Now, the girl had been secretly married a
fortnight previously. However, she chose
to risk the fun. Telling her husband that
she was going to visit a married lady
friend, she accompanied her older lover to
a parson’s, Out the latter baulked every-
thing by being absent from home. The
ceremony was postponed till next day.
In the interval, however, the “lady
friend ” met the husband, and a general
scandal resulted. The bank-man has gone
back to his metropolis poorer in pocket
but much richer in experience.

The fine new edifice which arrogates

Two Chinese Freemasons are regular
attendants at a Sydney lodge, and on exception

lodge fulminated the decree that in the I ree-
masonic eye all men are equal,
One of the two last-found-out N.S.W.
legal defaulters is a saint, and a great man in the
temple. Another attorney .who seems to have
scooted, leaving somewhere between .£14,000 and
.£50,000 worth of trouble behind him, is alluded
to in the papers as “ a leading solicitor ” —which
he never was and never could be. “ Misleading ”
would have been ever so much better.
* • #
Why shouldn’t thieving attorneys be
flogged ? People, so long as they are dressed in
poor clothes, get flogged for using bad language in
public. What sort of an offence is bad language,
used, perhaps, under the influence of drink or
hasty temper, compared with the cold-blooded
rascality of the chartered ruffians who are dealt
with so kindly by the law— i.e., the legal trades-
union the chiefs whereof wear horse-hair on their
heads ?
SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE, ETC.
SQUATTER’S SON : “ My father told you not to camp on his property, Neddy.’
KING BILLY’S SON : “ My father yabber your father like that.”
“ But flogging is reserved for brutal
offences.” Where is there a more brutal offence
than that of the man who, trusted because of his
position, embezzles an old widow’s money and
leaves her to have her very bed sold from under
her ?
* * *
Another man, drunk or mad, has been
flogged in Sydney—for indecent exposure in
George-street. Of course he wmre poor clothes—
was “of the vagrant class.” You can’t flog a
man in a black coat. The lash for the proletarian
always. Never for the bourgeois.
# * *
And see the paltry calibre of the officials
by whom this brutal punishment is dispensed—a
punishment almost equivalent to death in the
mind of a sensitive man--and even the wretch in
moleskin who, under the influence of bad grog or
temporary mental alienation, forgets himself, may
be of a sensitive nature.
« • »
Fifty-nine sixtieths of the men flogged in
N. S. Wales are tortured, not by order of a
Supreme Court Judge and Jury, after a deliberate
trial—and let it be said to the credit of the Supreme
Court Judges that they are slow to use an in-
strument whose proper home would be Dahomey
or Great Long-Fig Island. No, you find little
commonplace, glorified ex-police-court clerks, help-
ing to compose a “ full court,” and dealing out
lashings in the name of the Australian nation.
* * «
And, as to the wretches who are lashed,
who knows whether they are sane or insane ? A
man is arrested on Monday and ordered on Tues-
day to be flayed 48 hours or 72 hours afterwards.
The only certificate of his sanity is that the
police-surgeon or the gaol-surgeon (who has to see
one or two hundred cases a day) doesn’t say he is
•mad!

What has the N.S. Wales Labour-party

Editor Bulletin,—The lash for the
labourer ! At Darlinghurst a man whose appear-
ance denoted him to belong to the workman class,
last Friday underwent 20 lashes at the hands of
the flogger. Not very long ago a well-connected
man got six months, without the cat, from Judge
Backhouse for a gross indecency, the Judge con-
siderately and properly ordering him to be closely
watched at the gaol hospital. Had ho been in
working dress, two magistrates in Petty Sessions
would no doubt have dealt torture out to him.
Later on, another well-connected individual was
sent for trial for a somewhat similar alleged act,
but he was honourably acquitted. You never hear
of a labourer heimj sent for trial.— F.

at a fete, so that ‘if you pushed him e’d fall

Newspaper work pays so badly in Sydney
just now that one Press Association has sent forth
a branch in the form of a matrimonial-agency.
The Bulletin presents the daily presi
with a new idea. Let it establish a “Suicide’i
Column ” at scale-rates, and legitimately fostei
this new branch of industry. It already allot*
spaces for other domestic occurrences—“Births,’
“Marriages,” “ Deaths, ” “In Mcmoriam,” &c. :

That talented
Frenchman, M.
Lucien Henry,
for many years
art-instructor at
the Sydney Tech-
nical College,
who some time
ago left Sydmy
for France to
there publish his
book on “ The
New School of
Australian De-
corative Art,’'
proofs of which
have delighted
those by whom
they have been
seen, has, all who
know him will
sincerely regret
to hear, sustain-
ed a severe re-
verse. When M.
Henry left this
country he had
an order from
N.S.W. Govern-
ment for 200
copies of his
work, also an or-
der from the Tas-
manian Govt.,
and promises of
orders from the
other provinces.
But the financial
crisis has pre-
vented the other
orders being
given, and has
thus paralysed
the efforts of the
artist. The pub-
lishers have not
dared to take any
risk for so large
a work—a work
too great for the
means of its au-
thor. Madame
Henry, in whom
exists a type of
the courtly and
truly noble Frenchwoman, has now issued in
Hobart the prospectus of a series of seven lectures,
beginning with one on Jean Francois Millet,
which it is hoped will have all the succsss they
merit for their literary worth, and also as a
means of attaining the end which she has in view
—a voyage to Europe.

Dear Bulletin, —Last December, I was
one of Sydney’s unemployed. Unable to pet.
work, though, Heaven knows, I tried hard
enough, I decided to tempt my luck in much-
puffed Maoriland. I travelled right down the
east coast, from Auckland to Dunedin, taking
over three months to do the trip, during which
time I canvassed for a billet every possible place
in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. At
last, I got a show—at life-insurance agency. I
took it and spent four months at that God-fnr-
saken business, which is more played-i ut in
Maoriland than in Australia. Almost every other
Maorilander you meet is already insured ; the
uninsured is either deformed, or an invalid, or a
pauper. I had my eyes open all the time for
bettering chances, and, in the fifth month, ( lie
came. Australia is bad, no doubt, from Cook-
town to Perth, but times are admittedly at their
worst there. If Maoriland is supposed to lie in
prime condition now, what must it be like in its
bad times? If these are among its good times, it
cannot compare with “the other side.” I found
the Maorilanders jealous of Australians, espe-
cially in Auckland, where, by the way, the average
atom of the population is more sidtow-f aoed and
more shabbily-dressed than (say) the average atom
in Bourke (N.S.W.) The Maoriland
youngster is “cannier” and more staid than the
Australian kid, and—a notable peculiarity—he
speaks with the identical accent of his school-
master. I have met, speaking the broadest
Scotch accent, youngsters whose parents breathe
a lovely Irish brogue.—Yours, &c., Rock
Wallaby.

The other day a peddler forced his way
into the sanctum of a noted Melb, plutocrat,
whose pet boast is that he has never been “ had,”
and, by irresistible eloquence, induced the man of
cash to pay half-a-crown for a pot of coat-cleaning
mixture. After he had gone, the head of the firm
came to the conclusion that anyone who could
make him buy what he didn’t want must be a per-
fect wonder, and mentioned the matter to the
accountant. “Why,” said the latter, “he only
charged me eighteenpence !” And then little
Johnny, the office-boy, chimed in. “ Why, I got
one for sixpence, sir.” The smile has departed
from that magnate’s countenance.
CLEMENT WRAGGE.
(Government Meteorologist, Q.)
Clement Wragge, “Fellow” of several
more or less quaintly-named scientific societies,
and Government Meteorologist of Queensland, is
the recognised great weather-prophet of Australia,
about the only instance of a prophet who has
been accorded honour in his own country. He is
an unassuming, “ornery’’-looking, and usually
ill-dressed man, with no banked fires outside his
own chosen province. He first came into
meteorological repute in the S.A. depart-
ment, under the chiefdom of the lately-
ennobbled Charles Todd. Wragge was the
first official in Australia to systematise the
telegraphic transmission from a carefully-selected
cordon of stations of meteorological conditions,
and to calculate therefrom, according to baro-
metrical and other indications, the probable course,
destination, and duration of cyclonic and anti-
cyclonic centres. Wragge’s greatest life-grievance
is that every miserable newspaper punster will
and does sooner or later, mostly sooner, refer to
him as “ Inclement Wragge,” or “ Wet Wragge.”

The only interesting feature of the inter-
minable Speight-Syme libel-suit is an ancient
person with a long grey beard who sits out the
proceedings every day, and departs regretfully
when the court closes like a man who tears him-
self away with extreme difficulty. Nobody knows
this aged apparition, but it has been suggested
that he is the original Wandering Jew taking a
rest from roaming to and fro on the surface of the
earth. He never goes to sleep, and his interest in
the case never seems to flag, not even when a
hoarse lawyer reads for two days at a stretch an
endless list of Browns and Smiths who got free
passes for themselves and their wives and their
Flossies under Speight’s management. When
this one hardened listener dies of senile decay it
will be a sure sign that the case is getting near an
end at last.

Brisbane supplies the latest domestic
tragedy. A sexagenarian husband, with the
usual 20-years-yonnger wife, who gets the usual
“protection” order against him, is inflamed by
jealousy to follow her to a distant town and shoot
her. Some popular parson may now found a
discourse on the text that jealousy is as soul-
corn polling and degrading a passion as drink, and
invent thereon a theory for local option in the
wedlock traffic.

Police suicides by revolver-shooting are
becoming frequent in Melbourne. There have
been three at Russell-street barracks during the
past couple of years. The last, that of Sergt.
Derry, was saddest of all, being due simply to
worry, occasioned by the work getting behind.
Derry was a B.A. of Cambridge, and in many
other respects above the average policeman. A
very trifling confession of default, and less accessi-

At Sydney, the other day, a girl named

Newman, who appeared to be considerably above the

pelled to resort to the streets. Mr. Addison, S.M. said he
would give her an opportunity of mending her ways, and
remanded her on her own recognisances until Monday.
Now, considering that she still had the little baby
to keep, and that her chance of getting work was
just as hopeless as before, The Bulletin would
like to know where the opportunity of mending
her ways came in ?

now a Soup Kitchen, were moved to pull up a

Conies the customary way
To a palace or a manger,

That the “ pitty ickle dear”
Has been dropt from heaven here,
But when baby’s in a sack sent,
And we find him on the mat,
We inquire with startled accent:

Feels he’s called on to adopt
As a special gift from heaven
Every “ little one ” that’s dropt
O’er his garden wall, he’d best
Start asylums for the rest.

Stands ten rods from end to end,
And the “ Lord ” will quickly fill it

vades all classes of society, and. so, amid the
monotonous daily round of public exposure of
trickery and quackery it is indeed refreshing to
the mind to find an oasis, where the element of
deceit has not penetrated. The public have long

“ Marshall’s ■Tonic Nervine,” having proved its
many excellences, but when the additional
evidence of a gentleman so widely-known as John

Court, is tendered, his opinion is worth recording.
He writes:—-“By chance, a few weeks aero,
one of MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE
treatises was placed in my hands for
perusal, by a friend who knew I had been
for some considerable time a martyr to
INDIGESTION and DEBILITY. After read-
ing its contents and noting the various tributes to
its efficacy, I resolved to give it a trial, and I now
feel most happy to state that, after a course of six
bottles, lam thoroughly cured of my distressing
ailments. My HEALTH IS AT, my appetite
good, my strength has come back, and I enjoy
sound sleep at night, instead ot the restless, dis-
ordered slumber that previously was my lot. I
write this for the guidance and benefit of sufferers
from my old complaints, and think it my duty to
publicly acknowledge the great good that
MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE has done
for me.

There are in Queensland five deaths from
drowning for every one from sunstroke.
“ The Brigands blindfolded the traveller,
and hung him over a precipice, 1000 feet high,
only holding by his hands to a bough. Exhausted
he fell—six inches.” Wo have all been through
this experience.
This Austrian Universal Suffrage is a move
like Disraeli’s Reform Bill, to dish the Whigs.
Enfranchise the crowd in a country like Austria

swings of Toryism as Dizzy’s six years of Premier-

“ George Robertson and Co'.,” the style of
Australia’s most famous bookselling and publish-

boards. Charles Robertson, son of the original
George, manages the business at 363 George-

“ Thank you for changing your ‘ Missing
Word ’coupon to the cover,” writes a New Eng-
land (N.S.W.) correspondent, who gives no reason
for the increased satisfaction he derives from the
change. The Bulletin Competition No. 7 will
be found on the inside page of this week’s back
cover, and intending competitors will notice that
their coupons must be to hand not later than

The N.S.W. gaol-warders are agitating for
the retirement, on pension or otherwise, of Mr.
Robert Howard, the principal executioner, in
order that his place may be supplied by a robust,
athletic young man who will combine the dual
offices of hanger and flogger, and thus relieve the
warders of the stigma of using the cat. To do
Mr. Howard justice he refused, on his appoint-
ment as executioner-in-chief, to accept the control
of the whip.
When each lovely woman votes, parlia-
ments may squelch the “totes,” hunt the bar-
maids from the bars, but they’ll stick to Swiss
Cigars. Legislators draw the line at a brand so
superfine; even woman cannot mar Frossard’s
famous Swiss Cigar. Longer, better, cheaper
than any other brand you scan; bunched by
twenty-fives they are Frossard’s fragrant Swiss
Cigar. See you get the trade-marked brand, made
in Payerne, Switzerland ; you will never smoke
but this, once you’ve tried a Frossard’s Swiss.*
The grant of a free policy equivalent to
the amount of premiums paid, with 5 percent,
ndded, announced by the City Mutual Life Office,
■ s a step in the right direction. Nearly every
■ •ffice promises a paid-up policy in more or less
vague language, which 90 per cent, of the members
lad to understand. The principle, on the face of
ii, is a sound one, and the example of the City
Mutual will, ere long, be followed by the older
“ffices. It will not be the first time during the
p ist two or three years that this progressive
young institution has set an example worthy of
imitation.
The Duke of Edinburgh, they say, made
many attempts to sell his reversionary interest in
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, but his terms were
too high. Pity that Edinburgh isn’t Heir
Apparent to the precious British Crown! He
would let it go at a price. A Democratic Parlia-
ment might levy a small property-tax sufficient to
meet a Monarchy Purchase Bill, thus avoiding the
heavier expense of an old-fashioned revolution
Edinburgh would run up the extras, though—a
million sterling for “the Grace of God,” another
million for his royal rights in the Litany prayers
and so forth. ’
An English paper sketches an interesting
religious function that occurs every year at the
cross of Saint Junienles-Gombes in Vienna •
“All the local girls, on the day of St. Eu tropin s’
tile in prpoession to the cross erected near the
church to the saint. Each girl hangs her left
garter on the cross and prays that she may have a
good husband, and then gives way to the next
girl. The cross is so smothered in garters of
different colours that at a short distance it looks
as though covered with flowers. The girls wait
in suspender-ed animation while the eligible
bachelors go round with a tape measure and
decide which leg they will patronise.” This must
bear hardly upon some girls. Faith may move
mountains, but not a cold, calculating ruffian
with a tspo measure.
Premier M‘llwraith and the S.M. Herald
are agreed that the Labour parties, both of Q. and
N.S.W., behave unpatriotically in questioning the
statements of Australian bank - managers or
managing directors. “ Any injury to the banks ”
say both, “is borne by society at large, any blow
to their stability is a general injury.” MTl-
wraith and the S.M. Herald are to all practical
intents portions of the bank-management policy
of Australia; on the other hand, Labour-parties
are as practically the bank-managed classes • and
the assumption that the managers cannot be
questioned, cannot be criticised, cannot be cross-
examined without sacrificing patriotism, involves
the grotesque notion that patriotism consists in
conferring on existing managing powers a definite
financial dictatorship.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Tbe Caulfield Cup meeting didn’t commence on
Saturday as intended. Horses that always run stiff on
Guineas Day will this year have to hold over their in-
decent conduct until Wednesday, wherefore the sudden
improvement in their “form ” (only three days later) is
likely to attract more notice than usual. The adjourn-
ment is unfortunate, also, for the reason that horses which
might have done their best last Saturday, cannot be
measured for the Cup at time of writing. But with any
amount of “form” and “information" available, the
Caulfield Cup would still look an open race, for history
shows that all sorts of animals can win it, though they
may never do anything in particular afterwards. Two
that seem tolerably certain to run well are Jeweller and
Moscow. The latter has a very light weight, good looks
and recent wins to recommend him. Moscow will do as
well as anything else to lose money on—
If first to pass the judge’s box

The Argus recently despatched an interviewer
to Alf. Joseph, with instructions to sound that large
person on the subject of “ Wagering and how it is
managed.” Alfred discussed the art of bookmaking
(which consists, by the way, in finding backers and
learning to drink without getting fuddled) as freely as
Lohnen once expounded the art of burlesque humour,
but in the course of his prattle the betting magnate
worked off an ancient British “gag” upon his unsuspect-
ing visitor, so ancient that the interviewer is herewith
advised to lodge a complaint with the Y.R.O. Said
Joseph to the Argus representative, who was putting
implicit trust in him—“l’ve had all sorts of clients. I
wanted to lay Lord Rosebery a ‘pony’ against Sheet
Anchor for the Grand National once, but he said, “No,
thanks; I don’t like to see my money in the air.’ It
wasn’t a bad rule, and I’ve heard it cribbed pretty often
since." Now, possibly the noble Earl did impose upon
the Melbourne bookmaker with that chestnut, and maybe
it was passed along to the “ great” and guileless journal
in all good faith. It is about 50 years old, anyway. A
certain Fred Swindells was reputed, in the days when
hurdle-racing was young, to have been the first man to
object to seeing his money “ joomp oop in the air,” and
among the many turf sayings of Swindells—a much keener
speculator than Rosebery—this is about the most widely-
known. Tub Bulletin printed it quite 10 years ago, not
to mention several times since, arid the question as to
whether Alf. Joseph acquired it from The Bulletin in the
first instance ought to be definitely settled.
# * *
Dear Bulletin, —Be C.’s remarks about Messrs.
Crane and Wallace in the match for Australian Chess
Championship, “ that the games played have only been
fifth-rate, a timid massacre, and that each player dreaded
a dark horse.” Both players have a thorough knowledge
of the openings and books, and, though the games have
been generally uninteresting, they have been sound,
especially those opening with the Ruy Lopez ; the winner
of games 5,6, 8, 13, deserves credit for his victory, as few
players in the province could have conducted such attacks.
But few brilliant games have been played in matches.
Morphy’s brilliancies, with a few exceptions, were im-
promptu games, and Anderson’s celebrated K.B. game
was also impromptu. Crane’s great strength is hissitting
power—a power sufficient to fag out any ordinary mortal.
Wallace is noted for his brilliancies, and if the time-limit
were cut down to 25 moves per hour, the chances are that
lie could easily defeat anyone in N.S.W. if not in Aus-
tralasia.

The moon-faced hooky, Alf. Joseph, has been
talking: “I often think that I would have liked to be a
clergyman—if it paid as well as laying the odds. I’ve
booked many a modest fiver and tenner for the church. I
believe in racing-dreams; they are certain to name the
winner—when somebody dreams about every horse in the
race. One of the reasons of my being a bookmaker, as I
told a poor woman who asked me to put her last pound on
the winner, was a belief that backing horses was not a
good money-making business.”
* # *
Poor Sampson, who wilfully ran off the course
at Coogee (N.S. Wales) the other day, was an im-
perturbable loser, and a generous friend when “flush.”
He had evidently passed his limit of endurance without
showing an outward sign, since none of his friends ever
dreaded that he would thus invent his own settling-day.
* * *
Bookmaker Sampson, who recently suicided,
formerly employed a man charged with another a few
years ago with fatally stabbing a labourer in Sydney.
Sampson said he spent £9OO in law expenses and
procuring evidence to obtain his employe’s acquit-
tal ; he further superstitiously observed that somehow he
had never had a day’s luck since. The deceased book-
maker, by the way, is said to have been a cousin of
“Pendragon,” founder of London Referee.
# # #
When news of Teddy Sampson’s suicide reached
Sydney Tattersall’s, one particularly “ dry-hash ” trainer
remarked, “ Ah, me ! Poor Teddy ! I was good for a
thousand had he come to me.” Generosity of this sort is
invariably post mortem. The Bulletin never yet heard
of a live busted sport who found anyone good for a thou-
sand. Look at the vast array of people who “were good
for thousands,” had ex-banker Holt come to them in his
necessities after that horse didn’t win the ’Oxberry !

Junior cricket in Melbourne is firmly gripped
in the greedy tentacles of the octopus professionalism.
Clubs enter teams for the Boyle and Scott trophy solely
for the sake of the gate-money, and many players “ live
on the game.” Not only have some of the prominent
junior clubs got into a good financial position by this
means, where before they w'ere poverty-stricken, but
they have become opulent. Consequently, their power
,for evil in paying the price for the pick of players is
considerably enhanced. The wealthiest club takes the
cake.

“ Regulation of the diet constitutes, in fact, the

On TREATMENT of RACHITIS.—YoI. XVI.
“ In the treatment of rachitis, improper feeding

from personal experience of its value and con-
venience.” —Prof. Senator.
On SCROFULOSIS.—YoI. XVI.
“What form of artificial feeding ought to be
selected ? The results of our own experience may
be briefly stated to be in favour of Nestle’s Food,
the use of which was but rarely attended with
indigestion, while the nutrition of the child im-
proved in the most gratifying manner.”—Prof.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical
School, Glasgow, in an entirely voluntary com-
munication on his part to Messrs. Bosisto & Co.,
writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides beinjr free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, w'hich places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

Presence of Mind.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
At one of the weekly prayer-meetings in the
Grove street Chapel, Grabtown, S.A., the congre-
gation was led in prayer by Henry Rollick, pillar
of the sanctuary, and a noted philanthropist. A
man ready to lead at these meetings, who knows
what he wants to say, and when he has said
■enough, is an unmitigated blessing. Rollick, being
■wise in his generation, had acquired these perfec-
tions, along with many others.
His supplications were short and stirring, and
were tinged with a touch of humanity that har-
monised so well with the feelings of those around
that assenting murmurs and “A—men! A—men!”
encouraged him throughout.
The women were noticeably flattered, and held
their San keys more lightly when Rollick's voice
was uplifted. This may have been because they
were all familiar with Ids close, lingering hand-
clasps, for his manner was charming to young and
old of the fair sex, and at their picnics and annual
treats he was not more eager to introduce “Kiss-
in the-Ring ” than all the other married men.
The meeting was in full swing when Rollick
was called out. The general impression was that
an urgent case of dire distress required his per-
sonal attention, and his departure caused a slight
commotion.
In one of the side aisles a woman, with a face
like last week’s bread, was sitting. The squeaky
tread of the messenger, the hushed footsteps of
Rollick, and the interest evinced by some of the
women were all offensive to her, and if she did not
exacdy annihilate anyone, it was not for want of
inclination.
Rollick’s wife, a stout, florid woman, arranged
her rustling skirt afresh, and clasped tier hands in
patient resignation as her husband’s footsteps died
away.
A hymn was given out, and the organ sounded.
The organist for to-night was a Mrs. Smooth, a
pretty widow. The Chapel’s own organist, a man
whose excessive modesty explained the old curtain
which entirely hid the musician from the congre-
gation, and extended across the small door by
which he entered, was unable to be present, p,
Henry Rollick was away so long that he was
almost forgotten.
Towards the close of the meeting, and while the
pastor was loudly interceding for them, there was
a sudden noise near the organ. The curtain tore
away from the rings and came down, bringing
something heavy with it. Every eye was directed
to the spot.
Mrs. Smooth sat coolly enough facing the people
but when Henry Rollick disentangled himself from
the curtain and stood upright, no one knew what
to think.
“Shame!’’ cried the sour-visaged woman in a
loud voice. Mrs. Rollick laughed hysterically.
With admirable composure Rollick stooped, and
then, collection-plate in hand, descended to the
level of the congregation.
“That curtain’s very old,” he said aloud to the
bewildered pastor, and nonchalantly offered the
plate to the first row. The pastor’s brow cleared.
He saw how the affair had happened. Rollick
had started the collection with Mrs. Smooth, and
had caught his foot in the curtain.
Mrs. Rollick could not see her husband’s calm
demeanour, his perfectly unruffled air, without a
feeling of shame at her hasty judgment of what
was simply an awkward accident, and a few whis-
pered words from Rollick when he returned to
her side sufficed to wholly restore her equanimity.
• • •
The benediction had been pronounced,
and the congregation slowly filtered out. They
lingered in the aisles to shake hands and inquire,
with tender solicitude, after each other’s health.
Rollick piloted his wife out skilfully, but in the
porch she made a determined stand to wait for
some friends.
He slipped outside and stood in the shadow.
Presently, a little woman, with a fair, bright face,
came down the steps and stood beside him.
“ I told you not to,” she whispered.
“ Yes, but if you hadn’t made such a fuss—”
The congregation reached the doors, and Rollick
went back to his wife.

relieved the distress about my liver, regulated

SKINS ON FIRE
With Agonizing Eczemas and other Itching, Burning, Scaly, and
Blotchy Skin and Scalp Diseases are relieved in the majority of cases
by a single application of the Cuticura Remedies, and speedily, perma-
nently, and economically cured, when phy-
sicians, hospitals, and all other remedies
fail. Cuticura Remedies are the great-
est skin cures, blood purifiers, and humor
remedies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and may be used in the treatment of
every humor, from the simplest facial blem-
ishes to the severest diseases of the blood,
skin, and scalp.
CUTICURA
The great Skin Cure, instantly allays the
most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, clears the scalp
of crusts and scales, speedily soothes and
heals raw and irritated surfaces, and restores
the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite
Skin Purifier and Beautifier, is indispensa-
ble in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuti-
cura Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin

The Active Service Brigade and Tree
Speech,
Editor Bulletin, —Your correspondent “Locust”
is very wrathful, but he is mistaken. He de-
cidedly misjudges the above organisation. The
Active Service Brigade knows what it is about.
It does not desire to throttle free speech as
insinuated. One of the A.S.B.’s objects, as
printed upon its card of membership, reads as
follows: —“To prevent the manufacture of spurious
public opinion, protect free speech, and preserve
order at public meetings.” For the future, in
Sydney anyhow, the glorified pedlar of calico and
the wharf-lumper or coal-heaver will be placed
upon absolutely the same level when attending a
genuine public meeting. They will both be per-
mitted to and then mill both be heard.
# * »
Why should one side only be placed before the
listeners? Why should the resolutions of public
assemblages be a mere meaningless string of plati-
tudes? The right of moving an amendment was
wrung from M'Millan against his will, and the
right of electing their own chairman was asserted
(by the public led by the A. 5.8.) at the following
meeting. Trivial in a way these successes are, but
in the future they may possibly be the means of
hounding out of public life some of the greatest
political swindlers that ever ruled and ruined any
community.
• « «
Further, the Active Service Brigade recognises
that —under numerous disguises—the Social Ques-
tion is really one of War—war to the knife
between the Robbers and the Robbed —between
the Fat Man and the Lean Mob. Yes ! the class
war is, and must be, a bitter, relentless death-
struggle. The capitalists of the world have recog-
nised this grim fact long ago and are acting upon
it. Democratic “ Leaders of the People,” on the
other hand, only mouth beautiful theories, and in-
sanely sell the mob for seats in Parliament. It is
time the Lean Mob began to look the position
squarely in the face. They must expect no quarter
and they should give none. They are now in the
position of rats driven into a corner; they must
turn or—go under.
• • •
This is the idea that inspires the A.S.B. It
thinks that the time has come for putting theory
into practice. It proposes to assist in resuming
possession of the people’s stolen property, and will
work upon purely business principles towards that
end. It asks for no mercy and gives none. It
will use any business-like method to win, and its
motto is “To the Victors the Spoils, and Woe to
the Conquered.”

In the Teachers’ Train.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They are mostly single men who go down to the
city on the Friday before vacation; the married
ones can’t afford it. And those who do are obliged
to take their wives with them—school-teachers
are the most submissive husbands in Australasia
so they do. not travel in the same compartments
as the single men, because these latter smoke and
tell vivid stories. They are full of joy and cash
and strong drink on the down journey but these
things have all evaporated when you see them on
the last Friday of the vacation. They are going
back, then, to the horrors of the blue-black bush
and thev are very melancholy and regretful and
full of determination to take no more holidays
but to save enough money to be able to resign
and go droving, or something. And they glare
viciously at anyone who talks “shop.” But they
all talk shop on the way down, and are not
ashamed. The railway-men know the teachers’
train well, and make witty remarks about “ forest
rangers ’’ and “scrub turkeys ” and the powerful
smell of ’possum.
Last midwinter, there were ten teachers in my
compartment, all from the bush. One of the
number was a lady, and for about 50 miles none
of her companions was decided whether to regard
her presence as an injury and a check on his free-
dom of speech, or whether to be pleased and make
love .to her. By-and-bye, however, she said that
she knew some of them wanted to smoke, and
that she would feel so uncomfortable if they re-
frained on her account, for she was quite used to
it. “ At the place where I stay,” she continued,
“all the men smoke—and get drunk every Satur-
day. Isn’t the bush dreadful ?’’
The others fervently said it was—all except the
big, red-faced man, who said, “My word ! ’’—and
decided to be glad about the girl being there, for
she was a pretty little thing, and seemingly con-
tiding.
Then the big.-fat man in the corner, who was
obviously restless, and had been waiting all along
for someone else tado it, filled his pipe and began
to smoke stealthily and in a shame faced way.
Hut he livened up when his neighbour followed
suit, and presently he said—
“ Smoking always reminds me of a big cove I
had a great tussle with once. Name of Jacobs.”
“ Yes ?” said the lady, interrogatively. All the
others had meant to snub the big man, by refrain-
ing from showing any interest in his story, but
they were bested now, for he told it to the lady,
and they had to listen out of politeness to her.
“Yes. ’Twas a new school, out Carrathool
way. Always a lot of big coves at a new school,
you know. Jacobs was 19. Had whiskers. I
tried to hammer him one day for writing a love-
letter to a girl at the other end of the desk,
Jacobs says, ‘I ain’t going to let any man cane
me, but I’ll fight you !’ So we took off our coats
and had a go in front of the class, and I licked
him. Best boy in the school ever after. Says to
me one day, when I was going home, ‘ Not srnok-
i.qg to day, sir?’ ‘No,’ I says, ‘no tobacco.’
‘ Here's some,’ says he, and haiids over a big plug,
I looks at him pretty hard. ‘Not mine, sir,’ says
Jacobs ; ‘ 1 found it !’ I took it, but I know he
was lying, for I caught him afterwards smoking
like a chimney. Couldn’t lam him for that,
though, could I ?”
“Oli, wouldn't it be dreadful for a girl to have
a boy like that to teach !” said the young lady,
She was so interested that the other men glared
at the big man and tried to think of some yarns of
their own, and said to one another that they
didn’t see many points about his yarn. But the
gii’h still engrossed in the big man, said :
. was ?i vin » Scripture once, and one of my
■ \ ldTe c n , * , that Lot s Wlfe wa3 turned mto a
P ldowfu | ofaalt!
Everybody laughed very loudly at this, and the
ma ( n n « xt m e chipped in with :

enterprise. We were reading in the old 1.R.8.

the y w , ere by-the-bye) tenderly saluted
e “, ot ™', lbe Inspector was there that day,
and he did laugh when my girl said they ‘ tenderly
sal (^ ed each ot her ! ’ ”
“ I do hate to hear fellows talk shop,” said the
man opposite me, but the big man took no notice,
and was under way again with a tale of a man
named Jogson who had a good seventh up Tenter-
held way. Jogson used to get drunk every Satur-
da Y 1 appeared, at the local pub., and would then
fight all comers. He was generally licked, too.
O ne night he was more licked than usual, and
was thrown out of the mib. into a lot of
burrs. He slept there for a few hours,
and then went home with a plentiful adorn-
meut of burrs on his garments. Here he
remarked to his wife (untruthfully) Agnes, I’ve
just licked all the fellows at the pub., and now
I’m going to lick the man that made my pants !”
Whereupon Jogson disrobed, and tore bis pant
asunder with much violence.
“Nice sort of yarn to tell a lady !” said the man
who hated to hear fellows talk shop. “I believe
he’s Jogson himself.”
But the silent man (lie came from a half-timer
on the Lachlan) said—“No; that he knew Jogson.
Jogson was the man who slung Horkins out of his
school—Horkins, the inspector, you know. Took
Horkins by the slack, Jogson did, and chucked
him right out. And"—
Here the irrepressible big man sailed in again—
“ Horkins got another take-down before that,
when he was at Baigowlahmine. A great swell
was Horkins, you know, and reckoned himself a
hisr favourite with the women. There was one
little girl at a provisional that he was specially
sweet on, and she fooled him as long as she had
anything to gain by it. But she got careless at
last, and was reported a lot of times, and then she
got more careless, and cleared out with some
fellow travelling sheep. Just then Horkins was
sent out to hold an inquiry into the complaints
against Miss Martin. So he comes out, in great
style, one day, and finds no teacher there, but a
great crowd of kids reading a paper posted on
the door, and laughing a good one. Horkins goes
up and reads, ‘ Maggie Martin is gone, and long-
legged Horkins won't find her I’ It served Horkins
right, too ; he’s a hog.’’
The man who hated to hear fellows talk shop
whispered, “Ain’t they whales on shop !’’ and
then went noisily to sleep. Everyone of the nine
others now talked shop earnestly for 100 miles,
but my friend took no notice, and avoided the
temptation with so little apparent effort that,
after we had passed the next refreshment-room,
and he still held out, I began to doubt if he really
was a teacher, despite the pained expression he
carried about with him. But, by-and- bye, some-
one drifted into another “shop” yarn—it was
about the teacher of a second-class Prov., who
had a new boy, six years old, and very Irish.
The boy was unable, on his first day at school, to
follow the writing-copy set him, and, when
remonstrated with, said, “Oi cahn’t, Oi tell
ye ! ” He said this several times, it seems, in a
loud and injured tone of voice, but the teacher
still urged him on till at last the boy exclaimed,
“ Well, thin, Oi won’t, ye divil ! ” he said. “ Only
the word wasn’t ‘divil,’ Leggatt said,” finished
the narrator.
Then the man who hated to hear fellows talk
shop himself collapsed. He said :
“ I knew Leggatt long ago. Awful old fool, he
was. He wrote to the boss once—Old Hadley—
to say that his tanks were empty, and wound up,
‘ I have the honour to request that you will in-
form me what I had better do under these circum-
stances.” Old Hadley turned down the corner of
the letter (you know Hadlee’s style) and sent it
back with a memo, ‘ Pray for rain ! ’ ”
Said the big man : “There was a fellow had a
house-to-house up ”
The train stopped then at my station, and I got
out. I was glad to do so, for they were now all
talking shop. Perhaps they are at it still !

The Rejection.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
She says she’s “ very sorry,” as she sees you to
the gate ;
You calmly say “Good-bye” to her while
standing off a yard,
And you lift your hat and leave her, walking
mighty stiff and straight—
But you’re hurt, old man—“hit hard.”
In your brain the words are burning of the answe r
that she gave,
As you turn the nearest corner and you stagger
just a bit;
But you pull yourself together, for a man's strong
heart is brave
When it’s hit, old man—“ hard hit.”
You might try to “drown the sorrow,” but the
drink has no effect;
You cannot stand the barmaid with her coarse
and vulgar “ wit
And so you seek the street again, and start for
home direct,
When you’re hit, old man—hard bit.
You see the face of her you lost, the pity in her
smile
( Ah! she is to the barmaid as is snow to chimnev-
grit).
You’re a better man and nobler in your sorrow,
for a while.
When you’re hit, old man—hard hit.
And, arriving at your lodgings, with a face of
deepest gloom,
You shun the other boarders and your manly
brow you knit;
You take a light and go upstairs directly to your
room —
The landlady knows you’re hit.
You clutch the scarf and collar, and you tear them
, , from your throat,
You rip your waistcoat open like a fellow in a
fit;
And you fling them in a corner with the “made-
to-order-coat.
When you’re hit, old man—hard hit.
You throw yourself, despairing, on your narrow
little bed,
(Or pace the room till someone ttarts with—
“ Skit ! cat! —skit!”)
And then lie blindly staring at the plaster over
‘head—
You are hit, old man—hard hit.
’Tis doubtful whether vanity or love has suffered
worst—
So neatly are those senses interknit—
Yonr heart keeps swelling up so bad, you wish
that it would burst
When you’re hit, old man—hard hit.
You think, and think; and think and think, till
you go mad almost;
Across your sight the spectres of the bygone
seem to flit ;
The very girl, herself, seems dead, and come back
as a ghost
When you’re hit, like this —hard hit.
You know that “it’s all over you’re an older
man by years,
In the future not a twinkle, in your black sky
not a split.
Ah ! you’ll think it well that women have the
privilege of tears,
When you're hit, old man—“ hard hit.”
You long and hope for nothing but the rest that
sleep can bring.
And you find that, in the morning, things have
brightened up a bit;
But you’re dull for many evenings, with a cracked
heart in a sling,
When you’re hit, old man—hard hit.

Two Whaling Yarns.
(1) THE SULPHUR BOTTOMS OF WANGI
WANGI.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
On 21st Nov. 1887, the Costa Rica Packet, of
Sydney, was lying becalmed off the little island
of Wangi Wangi, one of the Moluccas. On the
10th, five whales had been killed and towed along-
side; another had been struck by the third mate’s
boat, but after sounding had “milled’’ under
water and come up right beneath the boat, which he
turned over and stove in. The officer immediately
cut the line and let him go. Five whales in one
day, however, was a good catch, and when, after
the lot had been “fluked” ready for cutting-in
at daylight, the watch on deck went below, all
hands felt both tired and satisfied.
That night the ship was surrounded by big
grey sharks, and at dawn, on looking over the
side, I saw that they had completely eaten an
entire whale, leaving only the huge flukes hanging
in the chains. Twenty of these brutes were
killed while cutting-in that day. Since the 10th
nothing of moment had occurred save that on the
19th a very large bull-whale, which had been
struck by the larboard boat, turned, made for her
at a tremendous speed, and, hitting her with his
head, sent her clean out of the water. The star-
board boat then came up to assist, and the boat-
steerer was shoving a bomb into the barrel
of his Pearce gun with the hammer cocked,
when the bomb exploded and carried away two
of his fingers. Meanwhile the waist boat had
under-run the line and was drawing up to the
whale that way, when one of the crew, funking at
the terrific speed, cut the line, and the fish got
off.
At noon on the 21st, as the ship lay close in to
the little island, the crew of a Malay prahu came off
to tell me that there were two whales imprisoned
in a small area of deep water completely sur-
rounded by a reef. They had, the Malays said,
been there tor two months, and must have got
over the reef during a heavy sea. The waist boat
was sent to look at them. The natives described
them as of great size and begged me to kill them
as they were playing up with the fish in the
lagoon.
On returning, the boat reported two enormous
whales were there right enough. They were of the
species known to whalemen as “ Sulphur Bottom.’’
They are black, savage, and as active in turning
as an eel, and although by no means so valuable as
sperm whales, I decided to kill them and think
about means of getting them over the reef after-
wards.
I had neter caught one myself, nor heard of
anyone else catching a sulphur-bottom, although
Hundreds of attempts had been made. But here
were two of these fellows in a nice little secure
paddock about 900 ft. long by 290 ft. broad. They
juuldn’t possibly get away. So at daylight all five
Ooats lowered away in high spirits, and here
ollows an extract from my journal :
“ We all pulled in over the reef and saw the
whales at once ; then the fun began. Every boat
pulled up and tried to get fast, but it was impos-
sible to do anything with such creatures. Har-
poon after harpoon, with razor-keen edges and
thrown by powerful men within touching distance
of their huge, gleaming sides, would bounce back
and leave not even a mark ! Boatsteerer after
boatsteerer, concentrating body and soul in every
effort, tried their irons again and again, and as
they saw the sharp edge strike the black hide and
the pole, quivering with the force of the impact,
tremblingly rebound without even scratching the
whale, they each sat down and gazed blankly at
their officers, too dazed to even blaspheme. One of
them, wiping his perspiring brow, said quietly that
he didn’t believe they were whales at all—they
were the Leviathans of Scripture cased in 10ft.
india-rubber armour.
“ ‘ Never mind, lads,’ said the mate, cheerfully,
‘ we’ll have to give ’em this’ —and the mate’s boat
ran up, got ahead of the big one and fired a bomb.
It stuck in the skin and exploded—outside ! And
now the thing began to grow interesting. The
Malays came down, stood on the reef, and took a
hand in the proceedings by flinging spears at the
creatures as they dashed along the wall, plough-
ing the waters into foam but apparently not at all
frightened by the bursting of the bombs. Not one
of these generally deadly missiles penetrated to the
blubber of either of them. Then our supply of
bombs ran out, and we endeavoured, by mobbing
them with all the boats, to drive them on to a
shallow part of the reef. No use. They didn’t
seem to mind us, and wouldn’t at last even get
out of the way of the boats. We kept so close to
them that we had every chance given us to study
their enormous length, and were struck with the
fact of their extreme poorness—caused, I suppose,
by starvation. They were so thin that you could
count every rib in their bodies. The only part
of either that was of any thickness commensurate
with their length was from the nib to the fins;
from there to their tremendously wide flukes they
tapered off rapidly like a snake. Their flukes
were over 20ft. in length.”
“ We tried very hard to catch those whales, but
gave it up at last, and pulled back to the ship
crestfallen. I have never heard of anyone catch-
ing a sulphur-bottom, and don’t believe it possible
to be done. No other species of whale is so quick
in its movements, and when you remember that
five boats surrounded each of them in succession
in so confined a space as this lagoon and couldn't
keep the run of either, although they were un-
doubtedly weak and starving, you can imagine
what a healthy, well-fed fellow would do out in
the open ocean. Nothing but a melinite shell
would bring him to!”
“ Some time afterwards, on carefully examining
the little lagoon, it became evident that the whales
could not have made their entrance over the reef,
for even at the highest tides there would not have
been half enough water to carry them over. The
only way in which they could have entered was by
an arched-over opening beneath the reef, and this
they failed to discover again from the inside.’’
AN OLD FRIEND.
In October, 1889, when cruising off the N. of New
Guinea, we ran one day into a big school of
wnales, and lowered four boats. The bow-boat
ran up to a big one, and the boat-steerer hove his
iron, but it drew out again. This roused the
school, and before any of the other boats could get
fast they cleared. Just then I signalled from the
ship for the boats to return and tackle another
school in sight close to the ship.
Three boats got down among them, and the
fourth mate’s fastened to a big bull. He sounded
at once, and the other two boats drew up so as to
be near him when he rose, for then his mates
would gather round and every boat be sure of
getting fast. This fellow was a long while
sounding, and the officers in the other boats
eagerly watched the trend of the line from the
fourth mate’s boat as it tore into the ocean depths.
At last the huge head of the stricken whale
broke water. He was surrounded by many others,
and the third mate’s boat darted in and got fast
to a medium-sized one. The instant this latter
felt the sting of the iron he made a streak for the
fourth mate’s boat—which was still fast to the big
bull; sinking under her he rolled, belly-up, with his
lower jaw on one side of the boat and his “ junk ”
(upper jaw) on the other,, and crushed her to
matchwood. Of course the moment the terrible
jaws were visible the crew sprang overboard and
by miraculous good luck escaped the fate of the
boat. Having done for one boat the \yhale settled
down flukes-first to about 30 fathoms, and, per-
haps remembering that the harpoon buried deep
into him, with the line attached, came from the
third mate’s boat, he rose under her, bit her bows
off clean as far as the bow thwart, and dived
again. All hands at once sprang out of that boat,
and had barely got clear when up he came again and
bit off another six feet of the craft. Then, taking
no notice of the two crews struggling in the water
he darted off towards the only loose boat that of
the mate, and rushing head-first at her opened
his awful jaws and made a savage snap, but
missed, his teeth merely tearing the outside of the
planking as the crew sterned her off. The mate,
who stood his ground coolly, watched the brute
shoot his head right out of the water as he missed
his bite, and then picking up his bomb-gun, the
officer tired a lanc.e square into the great, broad
chest.
When the shot struck the whale he was in a per-
pendicular position, his flukes deep down, and
showing the upper part of his body clear out of
the water. Two, or perhaps three, seconds
elapsed, and the bomb was heard to burst inside
the mighty frame. It shook him sorely ; he
quivered and trembled, and then, throwing him-
self flat on the water, he went into the agonies of
his flurry, rolled over and gave up his greasy
ghost.
Meanwhile the second officer’s boat had come
up after rescuing the crews of the third and fourth
mates’ boats, and then the chief made a hole
in the dead whale’s nib (nose) for a tow-line,
the lines were cleared and he was pulled by the
two boats to the ship.
Now, here is a curious thing. On stripping off
the blubber, near the ‘small,’ the shatp spade
struck against a piece of iron. The junk of blubber
was hoisted on deck, and it was found that the iron
was one of our own harpoons that we had fired
into that identical whale about 20 months before,
when crusing off Wangi Wangi in October, 1887.
How could we prove it? Very easily. Every
harpoon is branded with the ship’s name, and the
boatsteerer, whose particular iron it is, also puts
his private mark on, so as to avoid dispute by
another boat claiming to have struck a whale
first.
The mate had fastened to that same whale
nearly two years before, as you will see by the log,
in the Moluccas. The iron, however, struck him
too far aft in the ‘ small,’ and, just as he sounded,
he gave a furious kick, which snapped the iron of
the shank—a most unusual thing. But, then, the
blow was so sudden, and of such terrific force,
that I suppose it broke like a carrot. Well, he
got clean away; and yet, here off the north of
New Guinea and in the Pacific Ocean, 1800 miles
from the place where he got his first touch of cold
iron, and after an interval of nearly two years, he
fell foul of us again, and chawed up two boats to
show us he hadn’t forgotten the unpleasantness
that occurred in the Moluccas.

The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST F AVENG.
With Prefatory Note by Rolf Boldrewood.
Opinions of the Press s
“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a par The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the whites and the natives in these fai-awav
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who are fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”—S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of this is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.’’— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
‘“The Last of Six f and other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. P avenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are aood
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.” — Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen in wild nlacos
when human hearts are stirfed by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
talc of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr Favenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘The Haunt of the -Mnkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but. is itself relieved from IB.'

The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is nob
ef general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin s conductors claim thab every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the prod action of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clabns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, Tub
Bulletin wall fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, Tills Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy 'the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
