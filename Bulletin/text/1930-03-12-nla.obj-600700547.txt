The Felton Bequest Again
That body of amiable and eminent citi-
zens, the Felton Bequest committee, con-
tinues to sit in Melbourne on the important
question of a successor to Frank Rinder,
while the National Gallery trustees are said
to be considering a successor to Bernard
Hall. It is freely rumored that the former
job is to go to Sir Joseph Duveen. One
reason why the committee, which has be-
hind it a fund now exceeding £250,000. is
said to smile on the idea is that Sir Joseph
has offered to do the work of selecting pic-
tures for the national collection for nix.
Whoever will be pleased with such an
appointment, few artists will be gratified.
Sir Joseph is reputed to be a millionaire.
His benefactions to English art have been
large. He built an addition to the National
Gallery in London and an annexe to the
Tate Gallery for the housing of foreign works
of art. But he is an art-dealer; and to the
Study of Victorian National Gallery trustees making a serious
decision on a question of art.
artist, who is the only person in the com-
munity finally competent to speak with
authority on works of art, art-dealers are
anathema.
English art-dealers usually have a large
clientele of poverty-stricken gentlemen with
family heirlooms to sell. A popular method
of handling this branch of the business is
to buy up a nobleman’s entire domestic
supply and then engineer a fake sale of one
or two specimens at inflated prices. The
decoys are usually works by some long-deac
Italian, whose genius has previously gone
unrecognised. It is now discovered tha;
another Titian has been overlooked and
boom in the new master promptly ensues
The bulk is then easily got rid of to Ameri
can buyers, if the Felton Bequest doesn’t
happen to be on the spot.
Art-dealers also usually have one or two
living artists in their retinue. By carefu
boosting they endeavor to create a fashion
in their work; and fashions in art are extra-
ordinarily easily made. It is not suggested
here that Sir Joseph Duveen indulges in
any of the above devices for keeping the
wolf from an art-dealer’s door, but the
fact that these practices are common in the
European art market explains why picture-
makers regard picture-merchants with less
than the usual amount of brotherly love.
Australia, which has been fortunate in
acquiring one of the world’s most munifi-
cent benefactions to art, has been singu-
larly unfortunate in its administration. The
method of selecting pictures would invite
loud guffaws from similar bodies abroad
When Frank Binder was the Felton’s tra-
velling adviser in Europe, one of Australia’s
leading artists, now resident in Melbourne,
wrote to him about a Titian. It was a
sketch for “The Crowning with Thorns,”
regarded as the finest Titian in the Louvre.
The Louvre had been negotiating for years
for the sketch, whose history had been
traced back to a few years after Titian’s
death and about whose authenticity there
was hardly any doubt. The price asked was
£700,: but the Felton Bequest’s buyer did
not, even trouble to run across to Paris to
have a look. On another occasion Myer
Alston, the Australian artist, advised that
there was a Rembrandt self-portrait in
England which was for sale. The owner
had a patriotic notion that such works
should be kept inside the Empire and was
ready to let it go for £20,000. Without
troubling to have the work inspected the
committee replied that the price was too
high; whereupon the picture was promptly
snapped up by an American. At the time
Rinder was busy acquiring social prestige,
which the important position he held
enabled him to do. He was a friend of
Orpen and a believer in him, too; so the
Melbourne National Gallery has a dreary
collection of this fashionable but over-
rated Irishman’s works.
The obvious remedy for this state of
affairs is to take the selection of pictures
out of the hands of amateurs and connois-
seurs and appoint a committe of competent
Australian artists on the spot. Men like
Meldrum and Bunny in Paris, Cohen,
George Coates and Alston in London, sitting
periodically as an examining board, with a
business-headed traveller to scout around,
might differ on unimportant points, but
they could be trusted not to recommend a
fireman rescuing a baby, by Millais, when
there were possible bargains in Rembrandts,
Titians and Whistlers around.
As for the selection of a successor to
Barney Hall, judging by their happy-go-
lucky choice in pictures—one month a
master, the next a mountebank—the Nat-
ional' Gallery people might as well put the
names of a couple of dozen artists in a
hat.
F.S.
The Wages of Virtue
If anybody still has any doubt about
what The Bulletin Novel Competitions
actually mean to Australian writers, let him
hark unto me.
Twenty years ago I decided to become
a novelist. I planned to learn all about
Australia from top to bottom before
trying to write the Great Australian Novel.
I threw up a city newspaper job, took the
train to Bourke (N.S.W.) and the coach
from there to Cunnamulla, where I inquired
for the largest and wildest cattle station
in the radius. I
was referred to
Tinnenburra, be-
longing to the
famous Mackeys,
and then man-
aged by Isaac
Thomas, a man
and a horseman
from the broad-
armed rusty spurs
at the heels of his
elastic-sided riding
boots to the wide,
kindly, stock-wise
eyes that smiled
indulgently as he
looked me over
when I dropped
my bundle out-
side the station
store, told him I was fed-up with the city
and asked for a job. '
I got it. There and elsewhere I pluggeci
away until there was no phase of bush life
that I had not seen and assimilated.
Having been bred and born in the big cities.
I decided that I then had the goods. I
wrote a novel and sent it to a publisher,
who returned it, unopened. Did I throw
in the towel? I wrote three novels and
sent them to publishers. They returned
them, smartly, giving various reasons for
rejection. I pushed them to England and
they came back, very promptly. I showed
them to critics, who said they were excel-
lent, but there was no market for Australian
novels, at a profitable rate. Did I give
in? I wrote stories and paragraphs for
The Bulletin, and some of them were
published. I wrote stories and a serial
for the “Woman’s Mirror,” and they were
published. I sent other contributions to
other journals and they began to be
accepted. And then I knew I was on the
highroad to success. I was by this time
back with the pen in a newspaper office.
I wrote a novel and sent it twice to London
and once to America and they sent it back
with enthusiasm. Then I wrote one of the
runners-up in the first novel competition
and just missed the mark. I revised it and
sent it to a London agent and he shot it
to a publisher, who decided to publish it
on a royalty basis. A special edition of
500 copies is to be published in Australia.
The agreement says that the author shall
receive a royalty of 3d. on every copy
published in special? colonial editions. With
the aid of a ready reckoner I have worked
out what I get out of the Australian edition
—5OO copies at 3d. each, £6 ss. Ten per
cent, commission and 20 oer cent. British
income-tax have to come out of this. Then
there is a trifle of 10 bob for paper, a few
shillings for postage, £6 for typing (at a
cut rate) and the wear and tear of the
typewriter on which it was originally
written, with a few ribbons at 4s. 6d. each
thrown in. If the whole of the Australian
edition is sold I will be no more than about
£2 4s. out of pocket on an 85,000-words
novel! In fact, I- reckon I’m lucky not to
be in gaol for having written the book. On
the other hand, if I had happened to win
the first Bulletin prize I would have had
£5OO to play with, for the serial rights alone.
But perhaps a novelist suddenly in pos-
session of £5OO in Australia would be in
danger of arrest as a suspicious character.

inchester Arms-they are made for each other Jt
of For the Term of His Natural Life (Angus
and Robertson) discloses that something
like this happened to ■'Marcus Clarke’s,
story. In my introduction to the book I
quote the original publisher of the serial
in the “Australian Journal,” who reminds us
that thd book as published in London is
“vastly different in finish and even in
the construction of the story and the por-
trayal of the characters from that which
appeared in serial form in the ‘Australian
Journal.’ ” This is unhappily true. Sixty
years since its writing, now for the first time
in book form the story is as Clarke con-
ceived and wrote it.
The abridged story cuts out Book One
entirely, substituting a terrific melodramatic
prologue of murder and sumptuous sin, so
strained and hysterical that one cannot
believe that the same man wrote it and
the rest of the book. Thence we go straight
to the prison ship, endure with Rufus
Dawes, the innocent convict, the agonies
of the damned in the penal settlements in
the original Books Two, Three, Four and
Five, and black out suddenly with the
drowning of Dawes, Mrs. Frere and her
daughter. Books Six, Seven, Eight and
Nine are omitted. That is to say, the be-
ginning and end are gone, and there are
left only the horror and shame of the
middle, for which Book One lays the ground,
and Six, Seven, Eight and Nine bring
us gradually back to the sanity and sweet-
ness of life. .
In Book One we have missed a vivid
sensitive picture of the environment that
fed the penal settlements of the ’thirties,
of the pitilessness of Chance, of the deeps
of an unhappy man’s heart. We have
missed some keen, strong prose:—
No more tor him the glorious burden of humanity.
The law had lightened him of it. He was henceforth
no longer a man with hopes, aspirations, ambitions.
Between him and the world was a great gulf fixed;
a gulf whence arose curses and cries, and the clank
of chains, and the inarticulate moanings of agonies
too great to be uttered. “His natural life!” He
saw it before him —hopeless, infamous, bestial. The
convict ship, the chain, the prison, the deadly hatreds
that mutilate and murder, the foul friendships that
corrupt and destroy. The hideousness of his doom
fell like a weight upon his brain. For one wild in-
stant the thought of escape flashed upon .him. He
took a step forward, and fell senseless to the pave-
ment, plucked dowswards by the fetters at his feet.
We have missed all the motives, the cur-
rents and cross-currents that force and hold
the story on its terrible way. Above all,
we have missed the comi'ng-to-life of Rufus
Dawes, one of the really great tragic figures
of fiction, and not, as heretofore, a mere
peg on which the horrors of 1830 Van
Diemen’s Land are hung. Victor Hugo
would have been proud of Rufus Dawes,
but not of this morose lay figure, at one
moment a type of brutalised cynicism and
at another a heart-broken liying man. The
writing-in has killed his reality.
The other blight of cutting forces
Maurice Frere to hop on to the stage a
ready-made bully and cad, unconvincing
and unsympathetic without the illusion
created by Book One’s quiet argument and
character-work. The blight pervades appa-
rently less important matters—for example,
the smooth journalistic opening sentence
of the abridged story:—
In the breathless stillness of a tropical afternoon,
when the air was hot and heavy and the sky brazen
and cloudless, the shadow of the Malabar lay soli-
tary on the surface of the glittering sea.
And the same opening of the real Book
Two:—
It was the breathful stillness of a tropical after-
noon. The air was hot and heavy, the sky brazen
and cloudless, and the shadow of the Malabar lay
alone on the surface of the great glittering sea.
The latter believes in it, but the former
seems to be comfortably doing its job.
The last four Books contain the only
properly so-called Australian scenes in the
story. It is an Australia that has gone
now, not to return; but these final Books
form the proper coda of Clarke’s heroic
work. After the nightmare and terror of
Tasmania life begins to move, and faith
and hope, in this downfall of all faith and
hope. Mid-Victorian terminations in the
grand manner have the faults of their time
and mode of thought, and the end of
Clarke’s book is not any more free of them
than the ends of Dickens’s or Scott’s books.
HILARY LFTING.
Our Land without Women
The Wild West, fairy land and happy
hunting-ground of film directors, has be-
come trite, obsolete; extant only in barn
cinemas. That is why the film men are
searching for new Eldorados. The Germans
say they have found one, and proudly
produce, as the first German “Tonfilm,”
“The Land Without Women”—Australia!
Australia is presented to the German public
as the womanless land, although I had
never noticed any lack of them before I
left—in fact, there were far too many. But
the film dates back to some time when the
English Government, at the request of the
West Australian, sent out a ship-load of
young things to provide women-hungry
Westralian goldminers with unfaithful
wives. I don’t know when this was, nor
did the director of the film seem to. The
result was that the film is one great
anachronism.
At the time when a choice bunch of
grapes like this was sent out I feel sure
that there was no regular steamship ser-
vice to Australia, and still less wireless! I
am less sure about the date of the Perth-
Coolgardie railway’s construction and the
inauguration of the telegraph across the
“desert,” but I have a feeling that both
came long after the arrival of the first
boat-load of damsels. The final, crown-
ing joy for an Australian, however, is the
sight of the stately Commonwealth flag,
which didn’t come into existence until
after Federation, floating everywhere! Ihe
best point of the film is that it is not at
all insulting to Australia. In one way it
does a service, as it puts Australia on the
map for most’ of the audience of Germans,
who usually think of Australia as some-
where down near South America; and the
absence of all blacks knocked to bits their
fixed illusion that Australia is mainly popu-
lated by darkies. From now on, though,
the German who saw the film has indelibly
engraved on his mind that the Australian
is a wild, unshaven, lynching, collarless,
woman-mad he-man, and that Australia is
a collection of sand-scenes like the colored
prints of the Sahara.
As a talkie the film is a washout. At
the most tragic point, just as the beautiful
young thing is imploring the American
he-man doctor not to leave her, the voice
of God coming from the bowels of the devil
shocks everybody in the cinema by break-
ing forth in an imitation of the voice of
an old woman who used to sell hot-dogs
at Circular Quay.

The Terror by Night
To-day few retain conviction of the might
of the Unknown Evil which disciplined their
ancestor, the ape-man, trembling in his tree-
top as the dusk fell. Still, in Montagu Sum-
mers, author of The Vampire in Europe
(Kegan Paul; Dymocks), is a champion of
the ancient faith, and he is as learned as
he is painstaking. He has an international
reputation as an authority on the kingdom
of Beelzebub here on earth, and a confessed
believer in the recondite matters of which
he treats commands respect which cannot
be accorded to ethnologists and empirics of
a like kidney.
To-day, in England, France and Ger-
many, Rural’s lower strata still retains be-
lief in vampirism. Eastern Europe, includ-
ing Italy, Hungary, the Balkans and Greece,
accepts the vampire cult as an irrefutable
postulate. In “The Vampire in Europe”
the author traces the history of the cult
from ancient Greece and Persia to modern
Roumania and Bulgaria. He dispels the
popular idea that the vampire corpse risen
from the grave confines itself to sucking
the blood of the living, who become vam-
pires in turn. Your true vampire explores
all the accepted bypaths of evil; some can-
not even be hinted at save in the guarded
writings of the Magi. Furthermore, he or
she—or it may be it, since the demons them-
selves can and do take on the semblance
of vampires if occasion serves—is most diffi-
cult to banish when once addicted to the
unholy practices. Only the ministrations
of Holy Church—properly acknowledged, of
course, by the benficiaries —can prevail .
against the Lords of Darkness. These min-
istrations being necessarily long drawn out
and expensive, the vampire operates not
only directly on the life-blood of its vic-
tims, but indirectly on their bank accounts
also.
Probably jejune modernity will scoff at
Mr. Summers’s erudite exposition of a
belief shared by millions of European
peoples to-day; but in an age which refuses
to believe in anything it comes as a relief
to find someone who, while championing
the Company of the Angels, is not reluctant
to confess his entire belief in the mundane
activities of the Hosts of Apollyon.

A Satchel of Books
En Garde, by Samuel Morse (Cassell;
Dymocks), is a cape and sword yarn with
our subtle old friend Mazarin scheming epi-
gramatically in the background. The pre-
late’s staff work goes wrong as usual. He
orders de Villeron, roue and duellist, to
marry Liane, but she loathes him: —
She spoke not as one tasting the gall of defeat,
but as a lady to a despised menial. “Could I con-
sider myself alone, Monsieur de Villeron, I would
die rather than be your bride.”
Eventually the admirable Saint-Hilaire slays
de Villeron and marries Liane. An old story,
but brightly told.
The Love Poems of Joannes Secundus,
translated by F. A. Wright (Routledge).
Professor Wright has performed an exceed-
ingly competent and very welcome service.
His translation of the “Epithalamium” is
especially good. He has made from it an
English lyric piece comparable in beauty of
expression with Spencer’s and in joyous
appreciation of the bridal occasion with
Suckling’s “Ballade Upon a Wedding.” There
is attractive lyric quality in the “Basia” and
“Amores” translations too, but the work is
less even, although it all serves as an
approach to the glorious “Bridal Night.”
The translation is the first in English for
more than a century, rather strange in view
the unquestionable genius of the Dutch-
man Jan Everaerts, who called himself
Joannes Secundus, and, in the prevailing
fashion of the Renaissance, wrote in Latin.
Joannes, who was something of a sculptor
and orator, died in 1536, barely 25 years
old. In an erudite introductory essay out-
lining the Latin poetry of the Renaissance
and briefly appraising its leading lights, Pro-
fessor Wright does not overstate his case
when he gives the young Dutchman place
as “one of the half-dozen greatest love-
lyrists' in world literature.”

MORE WORK OR LESS PAY?
There is no instrument which we can put
under one man’s tongue and say it proves
him beyond all doubt industrious and under
another’s and say it proves him beyond all
doubt an idler. Yet there is some sort of
standard of industry, and we must measure
up to it when we compete for a job or a
market. If we cannot find a market out-
side Australia for our woollens, for example,
it can only be because we are not producing
them cheaply enough; in other words, we
are giving too little labor for the salaries and
wages we get. Whether the salaries and
wages are high or low is of no consequence
in itself: they are only too high or too low
when" taken in conjunction with the output.
A South Sea Islander who asks for only a
few bananas and half a sweet potato a
day may be industrious if he works three
hours a day; a man who insists upon a
high standard of living may fail in industry
if he works less than eight hours a day for
six days of the week.
Unfortunately we long ago ceased to
bother about standards of industry. Our
trade-union system discouraged them. So
far as we employed them at all it was
oftener for the purpose of slowing down
the quick worker than of speeding up the
slow one. The beginnings of this were
rather creditable than otherwise. In most
cases it was to prevent an old or indifferent
workman being shown up. Later the
class-conscious lunatic got to work, and
sloth became almost a virtue. In a per-
fectly self-contained country, having no
outside operations, this would not much
matter. If little was produced little could
be consumed. But when a country begins
to buy or borrow from abroad, then it
must also sell abroad; and the moment
it begins to sell abroad, standards of industry
matter enormously.
It was at this point that we commenced
to fall into difficulties. For many years,
however, Nature saved us from feeling any
ill-effects. We opened up mines of astonish-
ing riches: Ballarat and Bendigo were
followed by Charters Towers and Gympie;
on the heels of Mt. Morgan and Broken
Hill came Mt. Lyell and Kalgoorlie. Our
vast cheaply worked back-country gave us
the world’s finest wools. But when the old
mines had been robbed of their richer ores
and no new fields were found to replace
them, the trouble began to show itself. For
quarter of a century we camouflaged it
more or less successfully with loans. When
they ceased we were faced with the simple
fact that for all these years we had been
producing far less than we had been con-
suming.
It was not done deliberately. That sort
of thing rarely is done deliberately. It is
nearly always a matter partly of drift and
partly of altered circumstances. The cir-
cumstances altered in this case when, as _we
have said, we had to sell largely in foreign
markets to pay our foreign bills for imports
and interest. It was then that our old
standards of industry failed us. Up to
that time costs of production were not of
overwhelming importance. We could at
least protect ourselves against foreign com-
petition. But in the foreign markets we
had to measure up not against one another
but against the foreigner who was offering
his goods against ours. We failed to do
it: to keep our accounts square we should
have found markets for over 40 millions
more goods a year. We still fail.
Plainly Labor is inclined to say that it
is not concerned in this matter—that it is
quite content to let things run on. One
section, noisy but small, is even prepared to
say that it is not going to sweat itself to pay
anybody’s old debts. Both these attitudes
are based on a complete misapprehension.
We can’t “let things run on” any more
than we can let the rent run on or the
store account. It is the other person who
decides in such cases whether things shall
run on or not. The plan of refusing to
sweat ourselves to pay anybody’s old debts
is equally impracticable. No doubt if we
were dishonest enough we might repudiate;
but what then? We should have to pay
spot cash for the future; we should get
no more loans. And we have only lived
during the past few years by borrowing
about 40 millions per annum. We cannot
dodge the situation. We have got to
face it. How that gulf of 40 millions
shall be bridged is largely a matter for the
workers themselves to decide. They can
do more work for the same money or the
same work for less money. It must be
one or the other. There is no other way
out.
Readjustment will not be easy; but so
far from being hopeless, the course is quite
simple and quite obvious. Where there
is so much waste —of men, money and
material—there can be so much saving; and
where there is so much reserve of industry,
there can be so much increase of production.
And less waste and more production are
all the case calls for.
ALLEE-SAME BLOTHERS.
By no more than 80 to 75 votes the
A.C.T.U. Conference in Melbourne, alleg-
edly representing organised Labor in Aus-
tralia, withdrew from affiliation with the
Pan-Pacific Secretariat; whereupon the
minority made it clear that it would press
for the earliest possible reversal of the
decision. So it becomes part of the duty
of the workers of Australia to make them-
selves acquainted with the secretariat and
its aims and objects, or to keep themselves
acquainted with it if they had got to grips
with it hitherto. It is doubtful whether
more than a handful ever knew more about
it than the rubbish a few paid partisans had
told them.
The promoters of all such schemes for
pulling wool over the eyes of the masses
depend chiefly upon large-sounding words
and titles. Compared with “Pan-Pacific
Secretariat” that blessed word Mesopotamia
is a mere expletive. The promoters well
know that if things were called by their
simple names the glamor would be gone and
commonsense would reject the stupid pro-
positions. Yet it is quite easy to get the
facts about the organisation, told by its
own officers.
In June of last year Comrades F. Roels,
F. Walsh and P. S. Hannett were sent by
the A.C.T.U. to the Secretariat Congress at
Vladivostock. They failed to arrive owing
to the attentions of the Japanese police;
so they held a three-day meeting in Shang-
hai with delegates from Indonesia, French
Cochin-China and the Philippines, who had
also missed the ’bus for the Bolshevik city.
This conference, yellow, brown and white,
passed a number of resolutions, and they
were so like the resolutions that were being
passed at the Vladivostock conference at the
same time by. Tamils, Japs, Chinamen and
Javanese that a common origin is more than
reasonably suspected.
The, “instructions” given by the con-
gress to the Australian delegates were simple
and direct. They were told that, not
the employer, but the non-revolutionary
working man is the first person to demand
their attention; they were charged to
counter in eveiy way, legitimate and ille-
gitimate, the “capitalist offensive” of the
moderate trades unions of Australia; they
were in particular required to white-ant
the Australian Workers’ Union in order that
its “reactionary” officials might be ejected;
they were ordered to fight compulsory arbi-
tration, to foster strikes and to frustrate
all conciliatory measures, and, especially in
the colonies and dependencies of Britain,
to assist the revolutionary elements.
Further instructions were issued for the
publishing of revolutionary newspapers in
India, China, Korea, Japan, Australia and
Maoriland—legally if possible, illegally if
necessary (one part of this resolution has
been realised in the shape of the “Pan-
Pacific Worker,” printed in Sydney). A man-
date was also given the delegates to fight
tooth and nail all “capitalist” attempts to
settle racial, national and class differences
—such attempts, for instance, as the Inter-
national Labor Office at Geneva, the Insti-
tute of Pacific Relations at Honolulu, the
League of Nations and the Australian
Workers’ Union, because “only by revolu-
tionary action can the problems that press
upon the nations be solved.” In countries
like Japan, the Labor movement, said an-
other resolution, is to be decentralised
because the Red element is too weak to
take over the reins; in countries like Aus-
tralia it is to be centralised, because auth-
ority is already captured in the A.C.T.U.
That body, incidentally, came in for a word
of thanks for its staunch stand on behalf
of the world-revolution.
The programme of action handed to
departing delegates for transmission to their
affiliated unions included a policy of fos-
tering strikes for an eight-hour day; a
weekly rest; abolition of child labor and
flogging of child workers; prohibition of
night work for women; social insurance;
prohibition of sale and purchase of children
in factories; equal wages for equal work;
a minimum wage; freedom of assembly and
press; freedom to strike and labor inspec-
tion of places of employment. Thus these
crazy, doctrinaires are attempting to bring
about in depressed Oriental countries the
very sort of social legislation which they
are trying to destroy in Australia. That the
White Australia policy is abhorrent was
taken for granted—it was hardly considered
necessary to mention it.
This is the scatterbrained organisation
which sundry officials foisted on the Austra-
lian working man, and which they still wish
him to humbly follow. One Sidin was the
delegate from the Dutch East Indies. Sidin
was in a position to tell the conference how
the good work was going forward in his
sector. A couple of years ago, egged on by
the Pan-Pacific plotters, a handful of mis-
guided natives rose and seized part of
Batavia, in Java. They announced their
platform as the assassination of all whites
and the establishment of a native dynasty.
The rising was put down with much blood-
shed and some hundreds of the Pan-Paci-
fic’s dupes were exiled to New Guinea.
The Vladivostock conference nourishes the
hope of finding similar material in Australia.
A BOOTLEGGERS’ REFERENDUM.
A Prohibition referendum takes place in
Victoria towards the end of this month, and
a small quantity of rather dead excitement
prevails in consequence. Even the attitude
of the State Ministry, if it has any attitude,
is uncertain. Yet there have been few
occasions when a Ministerial attitude on a
referendum was more justified. If the result
is affirmative it will lead to immediate loss
of private income and public revenue—
conceding also that it will lead to the very
desirable stoppage of much waste —and
enforcement, if an attempt is made to
enforce it, will be an added public expense.
Any kind of anti-alcohol law increases
the criminal class. In other words, if liquor
is prohibited and the community still wants
liquor, which it is certain to do, and still
contrives to get it, which is almost equally
certain, it will obtain its supplies from law-
breakers instead of from citizens whose
characters have been officially inspected
before they entered the trade. And con-
sumers, except those who have their drink
delivered at the door or the window, will
be supplied in criminal haunts instead of
in places which are subject to police inspec-
tion. Some of the old drink-merchants may
go into the illegal drink trade and try to be
respectable at the same time, but the field
will be invaded by crooks and thugs for
whom there was little scope in the old days.
They can combine miscellaneous crime with
the sale of liquid refreshment. They haven’t
a valuable asset in the shape of a license to
lose, so one deterrent is wanting. And,
being practically in hiding from the police,
the concealment of an extra crime or two
doesn’t signify so much.
Victoria has a large amount of capital
invested and a great many people employed
in the wine industry, and this primary
industry has been systematically encouraged
without any thought of the possible sup-
pression to come. An utterly corrupt and
unsuccessful scheme of Prohibition—one
that increased drinking and made it more
poisonous at the same time—would wreck
the vine-growing business as effectively as
a successful one, if a successful one can be
imagined. A vineyard with all the appar-
atus attached is too large to be concealed
in a cellar or otherwise disguised. Sly-
groggery gets on better with more com-
pressed and portable ingredients than vine-
yards, chemicals of one sort and another
being much recommended. Many wild and
speculative calculations are made as to the
number of taxpayers engaged in honest
occupations, ranging from vigneron to bar-
maid, whom Prohibition would throw out of
employment. Whether it would furnish dis-
honest employment to a compensatory
number of non-taxpayers is equally specu-
lative. Distillers and hotelkeepers are at
least expected to put their earnings into
their income-tax schedules, but bootleggers
and burglars are not and do not. And it is
impossible to estimate how many of the
people furnished with dishonest employ-
ment would be content to remain merely
dishonest. The tremendous increase in
United States crime is ascribed' up to 971
per cent, to the difference between deliver-
ing spirits which are open and legal, as
against spirits which have to be defended
at the muzzle of a gun. A nation’s fiction
can’t avoid being in some sense a reflection
of the nation’s life. And in U.S. magazines
of the more “popular” class the tales of
battles between rival boot-legging organisa-
tions and between them and the police read
like a shambles.
Still, a no-license law, if applied in a
remorseless fashion, should produce one
definite effect even if it failed to diminish
the drinking evil. Almost every ruffian who
is charged on good evidence with brutal
conduct alleges that his mind is a blank as
to the event because he was “under the
influence of drink.” Aggregate teetotalism
enthusiastically accepts his statement, and
has a tendency to be sorry for him, and jots
down another crime to the discredit of the
accursed thing. Under Prohibition it would
be possible to demand that this person shall
corroborate his story by leading the police
to the bootlegger who furnished the alcohol.
Out of a mass of confusion would prob-
ablv emerge the fact that the ’ brutal
offender didn’t fall through drink nearly
so often as he pretended.
AMERICA CONQUERS GERMANY.
America has begun to treat Germany as
the forty-ninth State, to look on it much
as a pawnbroker looks on his securities.
Not in Berlin and the greater cities only,
but in the country as well, the Germans
lead the world in imitating the other great
republic. This is just what the other great
republic wants; it proves that it is, as it
likes to believe, the greatest peace-conquerer
the world has ever known.
someone said the other day that “the
pen is mightier than the sword.” The
Americans were clever enough to add “when
signing a cheque,” and now they go on
crusades to help oppressed peoples with the
pen in one hand, their cheque-book in the
other and the Mighty Dollar emblazoned on
their banners. Welcomed as the saviours of
the land, they are later accepted as kind
creditors, taking the rich markets gladly
given by a grateful people.
Already Uncle Sam owns about a quarter
of important sections of German industry,
and has invested so much capital in this
country that, for the same reason which
brought him into the war on the side of
England, he is now ranging himself along-
side Germany. America cannot and will
not allow Germany to fail financially again,
for too many American dollars would be
lost. Thus is Germany actually in an envi-
able financial position, in spite of the
cawing of the crows.
The American civilisation finds Germany
an even more fertile soil than it found Aus-
tralia. This is easily understood. Germany,
as a nation, is not old, and even now is
not integral, as is illustrated by the fact
that each of the larger States has ambassa-
dorial representatives in the other States.
All young nations suffer from a lack of tra-
dition, and the tradition scraped together
with such care, determination and obvious
intention during the short history of the
German Reich evaporated amazingly, along
with a large amount of pride, in the weeks
of revolution and hunger, leaving the soil
ripe for the American brand of kultur.
So Germany is already the America of
Europe, and Berlin is its New York. No-
thing American is too bad to copy. The
Germans exchange their pearls for the
novelty of the American trinkets. Smilingly
they open their arms and take to their
bosoms American jazz, American films,
American habits. American fashions rule
the clothes. All young men want to look
like John Gilbert; all girls want to have
that Hollywood figure and to smile divinely.
Almost the whole population has a seem-
ingly insatiable appetite for things sancti-
fied by an Atlantic passage.
The Berliners bow low before the gods
of the Cheque-book. They flatter and
ingratiate, and are therefore treated as
inferiors. They welcome and worship the
disciples of the Great American Civilisa-
tion, for is not their god great and their
pen powerful? Is not Money the true god
and America his prophet?
Thus the Americanisation of Germany—
and to a great extent Europe—goes merrily
on. A few small voices cry against it, but
are easily drowned in the swelling Hymn
of Praise. Soon the last remnants of Ger-
man kultur will be routed.
Thus does the fisherman who fishes for a
shark often become his own bait.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Butler Faces the Music.
Premier Butler has entered upon his task
of persuading the South Australians to keep
his Government in office, and is finding it
a hard one. It is not his fault that South
Australia has had bad seasons, or that it bor-
rowed recklessly to put settlers on dear land
(in some cases to grow things for which there
Was no market), or that it went in for gran-
diose railway expenditure just when road
motor competition was beginning, or that it
was obliged to pay 455. a ton for Newcastle
coal, or that it was plagued by Sydney
strike-promoters and Federal arbitration
Judges, or that it was denied a share in
the Commonwealth grants to needy States
when the Commonwealth was in a position
to make them, or that at the end of 1928
330,000 of the estimated State population
of 577,000 Were trying to get a living in
Adelaide and suburbs. It was merely But-
ler’s misfortune to be in office when all the
chickens came home to roost.
South Australia has a wise Auditor-
General, W. E. Rogers, who warned the
politicians repeatedly that they were bring-
ing about a serious position by prodigal
loan expenditure on “non-productive works.”
“The Statd cannot finance its losses out
of further loans,” Rogers reported in 1927;
“the plain fact is that it has been living
beyond its means for many years.” Quot-
ing these remarks in his policy speech, But-
ler asserted that “we heeded the advice.”
Unfortunately he heeded only portion of it.
He spent £6,500,000 of loan money in his
first full year and £5,500,000 in his second.
Certainly this rate of expenditure was a
reduction on the Labor Government’s crazy
average of £8,250,000 a year, but it was
outrageous considering the State’s popula-
tion and limited resources; nor is it alto-
gether true that the Government was bound
by the lavish programmes of its predeces-
sors. At the same time Butler increased
nearly all his taxes and service charges. He
made his income tax so stiff that the
receipts jumped from
£1,726,000 to £2,262,000 in
one year; he smote com-
panies so heavily that on
£4,634,000 of taxable income
1012 companies paid
£619,900, with the Common-
wealth tax to come out of
what was left. And, though
he claims that he has re-
duced the number of State
Government employees from
27,193 to 21,593—5600 in
three years—yet he had to
admit a deficit of £274,900
for 1927-28 and one of
£930,000 for 1928-29.
This should be a Warning
to Theodore and other
Treasurers, especially
Hogan. Drastic income
taxation is no remedy for
Australia’s troubles while
inordinate borrowing goes
on. Neither is drastic in-
come taxation plus remorse-
less retrenchment—though
the situation calls for the
cutting out of all forms of
waste. If the moral effect
is reckoned in, the Butler
income tax has done South
Australia more harm than
good. W. T. Murphy, some-
time Assistant-Government
Statistician of Tasmania,
made these pertinent re-
marks to the Common-
wealth Public Accounts Committee in
Hobart:—
“In the period 1924-26 taxation was so
burdensome that the cry ‘Taxation is driving
people out of the country!’ was frequently
heard. We were losing our population at
the alarming rate of two per cent, per annum
by net migration. When taxation was
reduced the drift eased considerably. Some
evidence in support of the assertion then
made in Tasmania comes now from South
Australia. In that State taxation has
become very burdensome, and the migration
figures show for the first time in many
years a considerable loss.”
Compare, on the other hand, the inspirit-
ing results of the 33 1-3 per cent, reduction
in Westralian income-tax rates, even though
that reduction was brought about by Com-
monwealth grants cleverly hoarded up for
the purpose by Labor Premier Collier.
Butler’s has not been a record to be proud
of. But at least he shows some realisation
of the fundamental facts, whereas the Labor
policy is based on the same old pathetic
belief in loans, which in any case are no
longer available.
The Bulletin’s private opinion is that
South Australia ought to make Rogers Pre-
mier and instruct Parliament to elect his
Ministers from the best material offering.
In the event of that being found impractic-
able, The Bulletin recommends Butler as
at least the safer and the saner of the two
possible Premiers.

The Queensland Cotton Industry.
The transfer of the ginneries and oilmill
established by the British Australian Cot-
ton Association to the growers, and the
placing of the enterprise on a co-operative
basis, added to the new tariff on raw cotton
and yarns and textiles, ought to set the
Queensland cotton industry on its feet. The
? u u j assets , which cost £560,000, are
to be handed over to the growers on pay-
ment of £137,500, which the Commonwealth
Bank has agreed to lend for 25 years. A
further £lB,OOO is needed to modernise the
plant.
The heavy charge by B.A.C.A.L. of one
penny and one-eighth per pound for ginning
has been a serious handicap to growers;
it was due to the over-capitalisation of the
company, which spent a large amount m
other than fixed assets. The yield per acre
in Queensland is well above that of the
U.S.A., and the average quality is superior.
Cost of production in Queensland also com-
pares favorably with that in the U.S.A.
except in the directions of picking and
ginning. If these can be reduced there
should, then, be
no need for the
continuance o f
the Common-
wealth bounties
beyond the
period arranged.
A substantial
increase in the
acreage under
cotton has already
taken place, and
further extension
is looked for.
During this year
1,475,000 acres in
the Upper Bur-
nett and Callide
districts will be
opened for selec-
tion. Much of
this land is
suited for cotton-
growing, and
would be taken

pose if prices were stabilised; and if
the projects for the building of two or
more mills materialise, other areas will be
developed. Whether successfully or not
will, however, depend upon the attitude of
such labor as it will be necessary to employ.

This New World!
The retiring president of the Institution
of Engineers, D. F. Harricks, gave his fancy
rein in Sydney the other night. Einstein
having banished time and space, we are,
said Mr. Harricks, on the verge of tremen-
dous discoveries. Physicists have had to
re-cast their views as to the nature of
matter, the very basis of the physical
universe, and a new earth, if not a new
heaven, is to be unfolded in this decade.
That is. all very delectable and thrilling,
but, though it seems to, it doesn’t promise
a speedy coming of the Millennium. In
the last quarter of a century, as Mr. Har-
ricks remarked, what used to be considered
the unpassable limits of man’s knowledge,
methods of thought and mastery over
matter have been passed. Einstein, working
at an altitude of pure thought. that has
not been attained since Newton evolved
his mighty generalisations, has in truth
opened up vistas more fantastic than the
mind of H. G. Wells ever visioned, and
Rutherford and his co-workers have dis-
covered that matter consists of nothing
more substantial than fields of magnetic
force. And, as in the case of the curse on
the Jackdaw of Rheims, nobody seems a
penny the worse—or better.
Suppose we throw off the last trammels
of time and space, manufacture our power
for next to nothing by splitting atoms or
harnessing ions, and manufacture gold by
a simple electrical process. What then?
Man will still have to work for a living in
some way or another, and if the past is
any guide to the future his needs will con-
tinue to be just a little ahead of his ability
to procure them. We have already power
infinitely cheaper; transport more rapid;
communication faster than our grandparents
ever dreamed of. The world still bustles
for a crust and the social problems of the
oldest civilisations still haunt us. Perhaps
mastery over matter isn’t our goal, and the
prophets of eld were right when they
appealed so persistently for a consideration
of what they called “the things of the
spirit.” The tragedy of our times in their
eyes would be that we know so little and
care less about those things.

Can We Improve the Jury System?
Dear Bulletin, — “Infra” suggests the
improvement of the jury system (B.
5/2/’3O) by supplying the.“twelve good and
true men” with all matter committed to
writing during a trial. A close acquaint-
ance with the problem leads me to believe
that, in practice, the object would be de-
feated.
(1) A verbatim report of the evidence in
chief and cross-examination is, in most
cases, a voluminous affair, of very little
value ,in the hands of an average juror, but
very valuable to one who, desirous (for
any reason) of acquitting at all costs, picks
out the inevitable slip in the evidence of
probably a most reliable witness, tempo-
rarily flustered on a trivial point by shrewd
counsel.
(2) The reliability of witnesses and the
probability or otherwise of their stories can
be determined mainly by their demeanor in
the witness-box; and as the salient points
in every case must be put by his Honor
when summing-up, theoretically there is no
reason why a just verdict should not be
returned by a reasonably intelligent and
observant jury of citizens, without their
being cast into a sea of typewritten matter,
mostly irrelevant.
That the present jury system is unsatis-
factory cannot be gainsaid; what we need
to improve it is a keener civic sense. For
example, not all the written evidence in
the world would have reversed a verdict of
“not guilty” in a North Queensland case
where a person,
charged with
stealing goods,
did not dispute
their possession
and could give
n o explanation
as to their acqui-
sition. Similarly
in a Western
Queensland case
of female assault,
where an obvi-
ously guilty man
was acquitted by
a jury whose
foreman later ex-
plained that
“they wanted to
give the poor
cow a chance.”-
Yours, etc., Quill.
« .
Free Farms for Farmers.
Dear Bulletin, —Your sug-
gestion to hand over to
. every Mallee settler the
deeds of his farm introduces
a lands question of highest
importance to every State
in the Commonwealth.
Mallee areas are only a
few of a number of similar
quality which should all be
included in the one class.
Land administrations have
approached the problem by
offering inferior country at
very much loWer prices in
later years. Why not have
the courage to carry the
policy to its ultimate con-
clusion and admit that any
price at all is too much for
many areas now lying idle?
A somewhat similar sugges-
tion was made with regard
to prickly-pear blocks when
W. E. Weame was Minister
for Lands in N. S. Wales.
It didn’t come to anything.
Yet every added settler is
a tremendous asset to the
country, and any Govern-
ment could well afford to
forego the little it would
derive from rent if that
little would make the differ-
ence between success and
failure to the settler.
An area of over three
million acres of country
known as the Pilliga Scrub
is lying idle in N. S. Wales.
Successive Governments
have tried various schemes
to induce settlement of this
country, but even those w’ho
once made their homes on
it have departed, except the
few around the fringe. Yet,
with more liberality, a great
deal of it might be coaxed
to provide livings for settlers. The
same principle applies to land in remote
places and difficult of access, or land
suffering disabilities which _ make it unten-
able under existing conditions. All kinds
of concessions are considered in order
to encourage settlement and relieve the
burden of the man on the land. Why not
try this?—Yours, etc., G. A. Baily.

The Queensland Coast Railway.
Interruption of railway communication
between Brisbane and North Queensland is
of frequent occurrence in “the wet”:, when
tropical rains flood the rivers many of the
bridges are feet deep in rushing torrents.
Fortunately most of the streams are short,
and in a few hours the waters subside suf-
ficiently for traffic to resume. But this is
not the case with the Burdekin, which has
its outlet near Ayr, 57 miles south of
Townsville. With its tributary the Bel-
yando it has the fourth largest catchment
in the continent, and after heavy rains the
water covers the low-level railway bridge
for days at a time.
On such occasions it had been customary
for the Railways to boat passengers and
their luggage across “at passenger’s own
risk,” but after a recent error, when the
capsizing of the boat resulted in the drown-
ing of two people, this practice was stopped.
Yet there is greater need of connection
than ever there was. After the accident
the trains continued to cross as long as the
water was not over the rails more than a
foot or so. But a recent startling incident
has caused instructions to be issued forbid-
ding the crossing of trains if the flood-
waters are over the rails at all.
Sooner or later there must be another
bridge. Until the line is diverted some
six miles upstream to a site where a good
rock foundation for a high-level bridge
exists, not only will communication con-
tinue to be subject to interruption in wet
weather, but there will always be the
menace of disaster.

POLITICAL
POINTS
S.A.’s Butler Government is unique in one
respect. Since it took office in April, 1927,
it has steadfastly refused to appoint royal
commissions.
For seven years or thereabouts Perth had
E. A. Mann for its Federal representative,
and Harry Mann
(no relation) for
its State member.
Ex-Senator Need-
ha m went u p
against E. A.
Mann last October,
but it wag reserved
for Walter Nairn
to shift him; now
Needham is trying
to unseat the other
Mann, who was • a
detective when his
namesake was Gov-
ernment Analyst.
If the little Labor-
ite succeeds, he
will renew an old
acquaintance with
the Assembly—he
was M.L.A. for
Fremantle in 1904-
OS. And he has
an undoubted
chance, for the re-
distribution has
been rough on
Sherlock Holmes,
and Perth has been
Labor before.
Ready for any Mann.
Melbourne Town-planning Commission has
presented its final report. The document
took seven years to prepare, cost £20,000
and weighs 64 pounds. It seems a lot to
pay for providing a Government department
with free shaving paper.
Westralia’s Lands Department fills in its
spare time overhauling Jimmy Mitchell’s
group settlements. The results come out on
the instalment plan. Last report deal with
four small “groups” which are in the books
as security for £595,381. They are declared
to be worth £191,375. Unfortunately, Mit-
chell won’t be billed for the difference.
Tasmania is mercifully free from the
nuisances who demand a violent distribution
of wealth ; and the Federal Accounts Com-
mittee learned the reason why. A statis-
tician told it that 90 p.c. of the taxpayers
pay on less than £5OO p.a., and that only
25 have incomes exceeding £4OOO, while only
five of these are in - the £6QOO-or-over class.
Ten-thousand-a-yeai* men there are none.
A bait hung out to vignerons to vote for
Prohibition in Victoria is that the wine
grape can be turned into a non-alcoholic
beverave without fermentation. It is the
nature of the grape to ferment, and to stop
it enormous quantities of chemicals must be
added. If this is done clumsily the concoction
is dangerous to life. The only person known
to history who was killed by wine as light
as the light wines of. Australia was the
Duke of Clarence, and he applied it exter-
nally.
The alleged “Australian party” seems
destined to be an obsequious
and unrecognised fragment of
the A.L.P. Crawling to Scul-
lin is part of the ritual; thus
a report says that “unstinted
praise for the work done by
Labor since it obtained power
in the Federal Parliament was
given by Senator
Duncan at North-
bridge,” Sydney.
The ‘‘objects” of the
“party” are to hang
on to its precarious
seats, and if the
Labor vote can be

there may be
a chance for
Hughes and
Marks. But
Labor cau
never put
Duncan on a
Senate ticket,
so crawling in that
worthy’s case is
labor in vain.
Justice Frazer, president of the M.L.
Arbitration Court, who recently visited Aus-
tralia, has been unfolding the principles on
which his Court fixes wages. It pre-
scribes minimum rates, intended to apply to
the worker who is “just competent and no
more,” leaving it to the employer to pay
more if more is earned. In Australia, Mr.
Frazer notes, the tendency is to make the
payment of wages higher than the award
rate a reason for raising the minimum, but
that view is disappearing in the Dominion.
The banks have put up the cost of send-
ing money abroad to pay for imports, so that
there may be fewer imports to compete,
against our own industry. The change
is so much to the good, but it is insufficient.
Australia needs to stop a mass of imports
which it has been paying for with loan
money, but it should decide what imports
will be stopped, and not leave the matter
wholly to the banks. Further, it needs a
great deal of permanent stoppage for the
permanent good of Australian manufactures,
and not just stoppage for as far and as long
as suits the banking interests. With all due
respect to the big financial concerns they
aren’t the Minister of Customs or the Tariff
Board.
On top of the two millions he was bound
to find under the Bruce-Page agreement,
Scullin gave the States a million for road-
making and absorption-of-unemployed pur-
poses. He complains now that they have
spent only portion of the million. The truth
is that they already had more road money
than they knew how to spend to advantage.
Nevertheless, the six Governments are urg-
ing the Scullidores to add 2Jd. a gallon to
the petrol duty—already 4d. a gallon and
stiff enough—and give them the proceeds for
additional roads so that motor competition
with their embarrassed railways may be still
more effective. _ It shouldn’t have taken
the Prime Minister five minutes to frame a
suitable reply, but “the request is still
under consideration.”
A French gentleman who manufactures
scent has arrived in Sydney to inquire into
Australian sources of perfume. He ought
to turn up the records of some of the chaps
who want to get back into the City Council.
Once more it is announced that the Com-
monwealth Bank is to be reconstructed, and,
so the tale runs, converted into a “central
reserve bank” that it may better compete
with other banks. Three months ago when
this Ministry took charge it didn’t know
the first things about the country’s great
financial problems. Some of its members
have been busy students since, and now
they know the little that is dangerous. Credit
is a fearfully nervous creature, and if the
Government begins making large changes in
our banking system just now it is certain
some people will think they smell a rat
when what they really smell is more like
a mischievous monkey. Anyway, so far from
conversion of the Commonwealth Bank into
a central reserve bank helping it to com-
pete with other banks, the change will put
it on another plane, and bar it from taking
many a risk that the ordinary bank must
be prepared to accept.
Emphasising their view that nothing their
predecessors did was right, the Hogans have
revoked the authority given to the Metro-
politan Board of Works to build new bridges
across the Yarra at Hawthorn and Victoria-
street, Richmond. The board has spent
£lO,OOO on a temporary bridge, and what is
to be done with that or who will bear the
Attitude of the “Australian Party.”
burden has to be decided. The Government
is keen on repairing the existing Hawthorn
bridge at a cost of £36,000, but as it has no
way of finding the £36,000 the municipalities
will in all probability be levied on. That
will mean a bill and more rates.
One reason why even Pro-hic-bitionists
should vote No in Vic. on March 29 is the
idiotic nature of the proposals. If the neces-
sary 60 p.c. majority is reached,
bars are to be closed, but
brewers may keep going so long
as they don’t sell their goods in
Victoria. And visitors, from
other States will be able to cross
the border with cars stuffed full
of liquor. In Uncle’s land it is
an offence to make
or import the stuff,
and in many other
ways the Act is
more stringent than
the proposed Vic.
measure. Yet Samuel
has to admit that
his Dry law is
a failure.
The land
boom has defi-
nitely burst,
but savings
bank money is
still being
shovelled out
to home-build-
ers to the extent of
90 p.c. of the alleged
value of houses and
allotments. Also the Sydney city assessments
show ah increase of £10,000,000 for one
year; the valuation of Fitzroy ward has
shot up from £2,155,000 to £4,237,000., This
is the very delirium of folly. The tumble
in land values had to come, and it will be
a good thing for Australia in the long run,
though individuals will suffer. It is largely
because of the fantastic prices charged for
farm, pastoral, city and suburban land, with
the obligation on wage-earners to pay 355.
or £2 a week for houses that would formerly
have been dear at £l, that Australia is in
trouble to-day. A post-war boom was pro-
bably inevitable, but by means of scientific
taxation the politicians could have kept it
within reasonable bounds and secured a large
part of the increments for the community.
In both respects they have egregiously failed.
Britain’s Labor Government has had
another narrow escape from defeat by the
grace of a handful of Liberals, four of
whom came to its assistance while seven
abstained from voting. Fifty years ago a
majority of eight on a crucial division would
have been no better than none at all; pre-
cedent demanded that an Administration
should resign when it couldn’t show a com-
fortable margin over the other side on any
vital question. Things have changed since
the two-party system went by the" board.
The High Court’s decision nullifying the
second Beeby judgment (it was rather a
recommendation) in the coal-mining case
moved the harassed Scullin to declare: —
It is monstrous to think that Commonwealth law
cannot operate to settle a dispute the effect of which
has been felt throughout Australia. The need for
increased industrial powers has been emphasised by
these two judgments of the High Court.
Still, Commonwealth law settled the timber
dispute, which raged in three States, having
quite sufficient industrial powers in theory,
and the settled dispute fought itself to a
finish jpst the same, as many other shindies
have done. If Commonwealth law isn’t
competent to tackle a local coal trouble, that
only shows that State law is. So long as
some law is competent where isi the real
grievance? Bruce and Page offered to take
the incompetent Federal Court out of the
road, and Scullin owes his promotion largely
to his insistence that it should remain there
and continue to block the traffic.
To prevent time-wasting at the opening
of the State session on April 2 Hogan pro-
poses to dispense
with an Address-
in-Reply. He has
two precedents—
one in April, 1866,
and the other on
May 13, 1903; on
the second occasion

being devoted to

public if he abolishes it.
It may be just as well for one of the Labor
Senators that the A.C.T.U. has cut its
connection Avith Moscow’s “Pan-Pacific Sec-
retariat.” Section 44 of the Australian Con-
stitution says:—
Any person who is under any acknowledgment of

Power, or is entitled to the rights or privileges
of a subject or a citizen of a foreign Power....
shall be incapable 0f.... sitting as a Senator.
In 1920 H’ughes had his former colleague
Mahon expelled from the House of Reps,
for an attack on the proceedings of the
Lloyd George Government in Ireland. The
Senate is the sole judge of questions respect-
ing the qualifications of Senators, and it
could expel one of its number if it were
satisfied that he was “under any acknow-
ledgment of obedience” to a mischievous
foreign Power through the Third Inter-
national or one of its pups.
The U.S.A. found itself with money to
burn, so it commenced to help its farmers
by buying and storing wheat to make an
artificial scarcity and raise the price and
encourage production. Latest reports are
that the Farm Board has bought with Gov-
ernment dollars, or contracted' to buy,
35,00O,000M)ushels, and is still going hard.
It is impossible to put this pile on the
market without damage to the price, which
isn’t too sound even now, so its disposal is
a nightmare problem. A Senator from North
Dakota has come forward with the hopeful
suggestion that Uncle should present some
25,000,000 bushels to the Chinese, and this
or .some similar freak idea may catch on.
If the Government barns can be emptied
there is always the hope that Uncle will buy
a lot more and fill them again.

being roughly handled in Parliament. It
has managed to secure control of rice, honey
and County of Cumberland eggs, and critics
morosely calculate that administrative ex-
penses consume the produce of one hen in
every five and almost every second bee. Hopes
are entertained that wheatgrowers will set
aside one acre in ten for the same purpose,
and dairy-farmers yield up the milk of every
sixth cow. But there is a vast difference
between pre-natal • estimates of departmental
expenditure and actual cost, so that the acre-
in-ten and the Strawberry-in-six are pretty
likely to both need a lot of help.
Perhaps Bruce should
have got himself up
like this.
The Japanese
elections were
fought on much
the same issues as
the last Common-
wealth elections,
but the result was
different. The
Liberals, who were
in power, went to
the polls on a
policy of economy,
part of which had
already been car-
ried out; the Lib-
eral leader, Hama-
guchi, had saved
£10.000,000 on the
estimates of the
previous Govern-
ment. They were
returned with a
large majority, the
small Labor runt,
which was loudly
promising Utopia,
being almost extin-
guished.
With the threat of losing their immunity
hanging over their heads, Britons and Aus-
tralians in Shanghai are pointing ruefully
at the history of the Provisional Court, in
which for three years past Chinese Judges
have been applying Chinese law to Chinese
in the Settlement. Three presidents of the
court have been sacked or forced to resign
because they refused to make an order con-
fiscating the estates of Hseng, a local mag-
nate who died 30 years ago. H'seng is
alleged _ to have made his pile by piracy,
smuggling and company promoting, but that
hasn’t been established judicially. The Gov-
ernment crowd wants the Hseng money, and
can’t understand why foreigners have nasty
scruples about the manner of getting it.
Perkins’s attempt to get the Eden-Monaro
election upset failed, with costs. The old
member tried to show that a parcel of 50
votes from Moss Yale, counted in that
Nationalist stronghold as being all for him,
had been tampered with after arrival at
Queanbeyan, where a recount showed that
the top paper was for Perkins and all the
rest for Cusack, the Labor man. Of course,
there must be absolute proof of such an
accusation, and Starke, J., ruled that it
hadn’t been furnished, suggesting that the
Perkins vote had, “by some slip,” been
placed on top of the Cusack votes at Moss
Vale. Perkins also alleged that many
unqualified persons from Canberra and else-
where had voted improperly, in Eden-Monaro,
and ealled witnesses to prove it. The Judge
rejected this evidence because he was “bound
to assume that those persons were rightly
on the roll and were entitled to vote” —
presumably even though they may have lied
like redshanks to secure enrolment and
ballot-papers; in short, “the evidence chal-
lenged the correctness of the roll, and under
the statute such an inquiry is forbidden the
Court.” Then it’s a dashed bad statute.
THE WOODEN NUTMEG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. , High Court found Judge Beeby’s second
interim award on the coal dispute bad in law and
void, like the first.”
’Twas a Yankee who evolved a line of
nutmegs
That looked, ’tis said, exceptionally good
Until some investigator rubbed a sample on
a grater.
To discover that the article was wood.
Laths may be painted to resemble iron
Or shaped in the similitude of swords ;
Useful weapons you assessed them till the
time arrived to test them—
And it seems the same with interim awards.
You may reckon this is gold or that is
diamonds,
To desired conclusions leaping in your
haste,
But, however keen your sight is, one may
be pronounced pyrites
And the other prove entirely worthless
paste.
It’s easy to believe what may be must be
When rosy satisfaction it affords,
But he’s reckless who evinces confidence
supreme in princes
Or implicit trust in interim awards.
Never take a thing for gospel or for granted
Till it’s had authoritative overhaul;
What you’re' positively sure is genuine
scintilla juris,
May be merely ignis fatuus, after all.
Accept no judicial say-so just because with
Your intimate convictions it accords,
For the very best, intended thing may be the
worst upended '
In the matter of these interim awards!

THE BLESSINGS OF ARBITRATION.
ARBITRATION JUDGE: “But, my dear fellow, what are you doing here? Don’t you know I fixed your pay only a little while ago?”
THE COLLECTOR: “Yes, thank your Honor for nothing! You fixed our wages, but you forgot to provide us with somebody who will pay them.”
“Disraeli."
Sydney Lyceum opened, in a more or less
rejuvenated condition, on Saturday with
Disraeli.” George Arliss, a brilliant Lon-
on character-actor who has scored most
of his successes in New York, stars in the
name-part. The plot is based on Disraeli’s
purchase of the controlling shares in the
rm?fi , and > as in so many innocuous
novels, the characters are imaginary. True,
stout old mummer rants unconvincingly for
a tew minutes as Gladstone, and a misty
yueen Victoria is seen in the distance at
tne end; but history does not mention
Charles Lord Deeford, Dizzy’s handsome
young protege, who saves the Canal for
England at the risk of his life, or the
Kussian spies who try to wreck the trans-
<lr wooden-headed Governor of
the Bank of England who is bluffed into
advancing £5,000,000 by the desperate Prime
Minister s threat to destroy the bank.
, A fragrant little romance runs through
this cleverly-written play like a melody. It
is as refreshing after a course of the sex-
Cr ?ik nt * cs Hollywood’s amorists as' a
cold bath on a warm day. Charles begins by
being a prig, who offers Clarissa marriage in
the patronising spirit of one conferring an
honor. To his amazement she turns him
dewn, at the same time taking the oppor-
tunity to tell him the truth about his out-
look on life. However, wise old Dizzy knows
she cares for him, and that they will be
aappy together, and under his treatment
Charles gets rid of his conceit and acquires
humanity. Anthony Bushell (Charles) is
a superb specimen of a well-bred English
yoath, and his voice and diction are admir-
iible. Joan Bennett is faintly American here
and there, but she makes a lovely and win-
some little English girl out of Clarissa, all
the same.
, Disraeli”. is something of a phenomenon
these days, inasmuch as it would be more
ettective on a stage than it is on the screen,
there is not a scene that gains anything
om foe photographer’s art (even the
nughenden garden-party could have been
done better on a stage), and the intimate
touches, which are the essence of this kind
of light-comedy drama, are prejudiced by
the remoteness which is inseparable from
the art of the movies.
The production is disappointing. Most
ot the political and court magnificoes look
as if they had hired their costumes from
a tancy-dress emporium. Dizzy himself, the
top who used to be “hung in chains like a
convict.” and who loved splendid equipages
and high-stepping hackneys, drives off to
the triumph of his lifetime wearing an
unbrushed topper, and seated in a pathetic
little Victoria drawn by a pair of shuffling
half-breds.
However, the acting more than compen-
sates for the shabbiness. Arliss might have
been created to double Disraeli. He has
the appearance and, even more important,
the voice in which to register the dry,
fleering wit which we associate with the
great Hebrew arrivist. Mrs. Arliss makes
Dizzy’s ailing old wife a vigorous, middle-
aged woman, but then, as has been observed
already, the play does not pretend to be
historical. Unfortunately, her buxom charm
tends to put a wrong construction on his
habit of handing her flowers and talking of
their love. In this play he is not a chival-
rous, grateful man deferring to age, but the
slightly senile lover of an attractive wife.
English is spoken by most of the performers,
and spoken well. A visit to “Disraeli” is
worth while, if only to be reminded of the
reverence with which the educated English
of half a century ago handled their beau-
tiful language.
“The Question of the Day.”
It was inevitable that the U.S.A.’s flood
of crime should produce a flood of morality
plays. One of them is “The Question of
the Day.” A society girl, by going for a
walk in the shameless livery of her class,
has so inflamed a worthy sailorman, back
from a long whaling cruise, that lie accosts
her. The girl and her mother—an insuffer-
able pair—want the police chief to punish
the man. The chief takes the view that the
sailor made an understandable error, ,and
he pours such a broadside into the. com-
plainants with regard to their habits of
gambling, drinking, and “dressing in a man-
ner designed to arouse all man’s basest,
vilest and most lustful instincts,’.’ or words
to that effect, that they skulk off abashed.
It is • one of the many disabilities of a
country with no cinema industry of its own
that it is always liable to have irrelevant
trash of this description unloaded on it.
“The Thirteenth Chair.”
“The Thirteenth Chair” (Metro-Gold-
wyn), at Sydney Regent, puts a severer
strain on the public’s credulity than
most plays of class. The first murder
is the kind of thing that might hap-
pen to anyone—a straightforward . stab
in the back delivered privately. It is the
second that demands the gift of faith. The
thirteen leading members of the cast are
having a seance, with the object of dis-
covering who did the first murder, when the
usual yell is heard, and when the lights go
up the inevitable corpse is found. The victim
has been struck stone dead inside two or three
seconds. Many objections will be lodged by
those who expect to find some relation to
life even in horror plays. Also, the thing is
without movement or humor. Margaret
Wycherley makes an eerie figure of the senti-
mental, fortune-telling old Madame La
Grange, and Conrad Nagel is impressive and
audible as Richard Crosby.
“Woman io Woman.
“Woman to Woman,” the new show at
the State (Sydney), is the kind of produc-
tion that must chill the hearts of those who
hope for the return of the legitimate drama.
Yet the story is extraordinarily trite. David,
a young English officer, meets Lola, a dancing
girl, while he is on short leave in Paris
during the war, and they fall in love. He
means to do the right thing by her, but
while he is roaming the boulevards in search
of a clergyman he runs into an M.P, patrol,
and is ordered back to the line. The 191*
push has begun. He is wounded, loses his
memory, marries another girl, and makes a
failure of it. He is at a London theatre,
five years later, when Lola comes on as the
star of the revue. When she sings the song
that he heard first from her in Paris his
memory returns. They meet, and she shows
him their boy. She wants him to adopt the
boy, but his wife refuses. A big scene
follows in which she gives the wife the option
between taking the boy and having her
husband taken from her.
Such obvious old stuff would be in danger
of getting the bird as a play nowadays. As
a talkie it is worked up into an absorbing
entertainment. The producer is chiefly
responsible. The Paris scenes do not merely
suggest Paris; watching them you are in
war-time Paris, seeing the street and restau-
rant life, listening to the sharp discordances
of the crowd. In a play the fact that David
had been wounded would have been revealed
by, one of the characters. Here we are
shown the front-line trench. We watch him
doing his job, hear the 5.9 coming over and
see it burst. “Stretcher-bearers at the
double!” the familiar cry rises above the
din of battle, and the stretcher-bearers
plunge along the ruined duckboards and get
to work. It is war as it was in 1918 —a
picture that no stage-producer could hope
to give. Similarly with the London stage
scenes in which Lola figures. What does it
matter that the round, melodious singing
voice which is supposed to issue from her
throat is palpably the property of another?
(At one stage she emits a' resounding top
note with her mouth closed and teeth show-
ing in a pleasing smile, j We get somebody
else’s vocal gifts, superimposed upon her
charm and beauty, and the illusion, barring
that one accident, is entirely satisfactory.
Betty Compson speaks broken English
during the war and American afterwards,
but is equally attractive in her joy and
restrained in her grief, whichever language
she speaks. As David, George Barraud, who
was here with Pauline Frederick’s company
four years ago,, gives English tailoring and
the English voice a good advt. But,
like most English actors of emotional parts,
he is troubled with actorishness. The Irving
manner is taking an unconscionable long
time to die. His slow, agonised admission
that he is married sounds comic in these
days of easy divorce.
“Don’t Believe It.”
It is significant of something or other
that, since Uncle Sam went in for prohibi-
tion, the output of
booze dramas, booze
romances and booze
farces has outdis-
tanced that of all the
other civilised nations
put together. “Don’t
Believe It,” the sup-
porting show at the
State, is a typical
American booze farce.
It opens with a club
scene in which all the
members are sozzled.
A husband, whose wife
is waiting to be taken
to a theatre, subse-
quently wakes on the
deck of a steamer
bound for Florida. He
is still tight when he
reaches Florida, and
tighter than ever when
he gets home again. There is only
one unsympathetic character —a house-
maid who , believes in the 18th amend-
ment —and that may be significant of some-
thing also. Jimmy Gleeson represents the
dipsomaniacal husband. It is a delight to
watch his easy, polished work. There is
ground for suspicion that the Americans
are the Frenchmen of the English-speaking
theatrical world. Most of them get their
effects as effortlessly as Frenchmen, and
they rarely overplay. Gleeson in “Don’t
Believe It” omits to hiccup, belch, place an
apologetic hand to the mouth, fall down,
cross his eyes, ruffle his hair, undo his collar
or perform any of the other tricks that Brit-
ish tradition demands of stage inebriates,
yet he never fails to convey that he is as
badly under the weather as it is possible
for a man to be while remaining in posses-
sion of his senses.
“Gossip.”
The pictures might do useful work in the
way of showing one half of the world the
way the other half lives, but there is a
strong suspicion that they usually fall down
on the job. Consider “Gossip,” which pre-
cedes “Paris” at the St. James. The three
characters —a husband and wife on their
honeymoon, and a friend who does not know
they are married —are rich enough to fre-
quent expensive hotels and make trips to
Europe. Yet their crude offensiveness to one
another would cause trouble in much less
pretentious circles. The husband and wife
are arguing truculently about gossiping men
when the friend arrives. He confides the
husband’s past to the wife, and the wife’s
to the husband. Denounced by them, he
promises to reform. The telephone rings,
and he begins gossiping over the wire. The
play ends with his remark that the lady
he has been discussing dopes. The manners
of the trio, like their clothes and the hotel
furniture, are probably libels on America.
CHARLES KING in
"The Hollywood Revue.”
Edifying effect of
“mother” song on razor-
gangsters.
If not, it helps to explain the high national
murder-rate. Unfortunately for the U.S.A.,
the talkies habitually offer these exceptions
to the world as the rule.

Australian Army Orders notes the appoint-
ment of Lieut. Edward Chauvel, younger son
of the General, to the cavalry of the 4th
Military District (S. Aus.). The youngster,
who graduated at Duntroon last year, was
head of his class in eight subjects and was
awarded the King’s Medal as the most
efficient cadet during his course. An elder
brother, lan, is attached to the cavalry school
at Saugor, India.

or 70 unselfish patriots striving disinterest-
edly for the good of their country; what he
found was one party at a machine grinding
out legislation in a manner that shocked him
by its casualness, while another party threw
dirt and stale cats into the works. Mr. Ross
will probably retire from politics if he feels
like that: the trouble with most of the good
many who feel like that is that they haven’t
got anything half as profitable to retire to,
wherefore they leave off worrying and
remain.
Ramsay MacDonald’s Government in Eng-
land lately decided to set up a British Econo-
mic Advisory Council, and Queensland has
followed with a Bureau of Economics and
Statistics. Thus far its job hasn’t been well
defined; but with Professor Brigden at its
head it is sure to do something. And there
is plenty of work to be done: half our
troubles arise from want of knowledge. Brig-
PROFESSOR J . B. BRIGDEN
den is the young Victorian who formerly
was Professor of Economics in the Tas-
manian Uni. and thus got into the public
eye. The Bulletin cheerfully confesses
that he got into its own eye, and that at
one time it had good hopes of luring him
on to its staff, along with that other fine
ex-Tasmanian official, Prof. Giblin. But
Brigden is better where he is.
A noted stockbreeder was A. M. Mac-
donald, just dead in S.A., and he gave vari-
ous States a turn. Born at Longwood
(Vic.) in 1872, his first experience was as
manager of Bulla Downs (Q.), where he
made a name with shorthorns, and presently
he moved on to acquire Wompah. Later
.he owned Olive Downs and Grassmere, in
N.S.W., but eventually settled in S.A. Lash-
brooke, near Macclesfield, was his final home,
and he has left a large family, mostly with
aggressively Scotch names.
W. G. Ardlie, solicitor, of Warrnambool
(Vic.), was admitted in 1865, and is still
practising. Some time ago he was informed
that there were two solicitors in Sydney
whose records would challenge his, but inves-
tigations showed that Ardlie was an older
man and a slightly older lawyer than either.
He is still very active, and never misses an
important race-meeting at Flemington.
“Happy Jack” Scaddan, who will con-
test a metropolitan seat in the forthcoming
Westralian elections, used to be reckoned
about the luckiest politician in Australia;
in seven years he progressed from an engine-
driver’s job on the Golden Mile to the
Premiership of the State. It was in the
war years that Scaddan’s luck deserted him;
he left his party on the Conscription issue,
after a long period of vacillation, and lost
his goldfields seat. His erstwhile opponents,
now in office, presently found him a coastal
electorate and a place in the Cabinet, but
he threw up both half a dozen years ago
to become manager of a motor enterprise,
with disappointing results. This is his second
attempt to get back to the Parliamentary
arena. Born at historic Moonta over 50
years ago, he has a breezy personality, and
Labor never had a more popular leader than
he proved in the pre-war years.
John Brown, a character sketch:—
The late John Brown was one of the oddest
characters Australia has produced. He had the
puritanical visage of the traditional wowser, and he
heightened the effect by the funereal garments in
which he clothed his 6ft.-odd of upright bone and
muscle. Yet his favorite Sydney haunt was a winter
garden, and he loved the company of smartly-
dressed women. His private councils with the
training fraternity were friendlier than those of
most racing owners, yet he had quarrelled violently
with almost every leading trainer in N. S. Wales.
Labor orators always made him the villain in every
strike drama staged in the Newcastle area, but most
of the miners remained secretly friendly to him.
They trusted him, and saw the goodwill that lay
behind his truculence. The truth is there was a
strong strain of theatricality in John Brown’s make-
up. He liked playing the part of the relentless
capitalist—the man who knew all about miners’
tricks because he had hewn coal beside them —but
his iron visage was always liable to break into a
grim smile in the midst of a hymn of hate. To
the general public he held no ideals, public or
private, and no ambitions except to add to his
fortune. Those who knew him best say this esti-
mate was all wrong, and his last pronouncement
on the coal dispute supports them. “I’m fighting
for the men’s best interests,” he said. “Do you
think one with my expectation of life would want
to take them down?”
When Harry Sutherland, secretary of the
N. S. Wales enginedrivers, made his attack
on Comrade Garden for his Asiatic affilia-
tons at the Trades Union Congress in Mel-
bourne, he was getting back a bit of his
own. Sutherland was a very sick man a few
months ago. He went to a Trades Hall
barney in Sydney and caught the eye of
ex-Rev. Garden. That gentleman devoted
half an hour to a verbal assault on Suther-
land, who was too weak to do anything but
sit and listen. It was Garden who had to
listen with a wry face when Sutherland
turned the tide against the Red section.
Few prospectors become opulent, but
octogenarian John Newell, just now down
in Sydney to see the optician, is an excep-
tion .He came to Brisbane from Ireland when
a youngster, and presently was carrying his
swag to the Hodgkinson and the Palmer.
With William Jack, John Brown and Tom
Brandon for mates he adventured into the
then unknown Herberton ranges, where the
party located the Great Northern, still Aus-
tralia’s premier tin-producer. The great
alluvial rush to Nigger Creek, on the Wild
River, soon followed, and in 1852 Newell
and Jack became partners in a “chain” of
stores which extended over almost every
mining-field in N.Q. Newell turned to
politics in the pre-Federation days and sat
for two terms as M.L.A. for Woothakata.
Just passed out at South Grafton, Clar-
ence River (N.S.W.), Mrs. Catherine Foran,
who claimed to have been the first white
child born on the North Coast. Her parents
arrived in South Grafton away in 1841, and
she was 87 at the finish.
C. J. Pope, just promoted captain on the
sea-going list of the R.A.N., is the
fourth pukka R.A.N. holder of that rank.
Pope has been on loan to the R.N. for
several years, during which he annexed a
Staff College degree and served as com-
mander in H.M.S. Hood, Britain’s biggest
man-o’-war. In 1914, as a lieutenant on
H.M.A.S. Sydney, he helped to end the career
of the Emden.
Frank Russell, dead in London at 53, was
an Australian who made himself a man of
note in the oil world. After serving his time
as an engineer in his native Brisbane, he
followed the trail of bit and derrick all
over the earth. He was general manager for
the big Tweedie interests in Russia early
in the century, and thence went to Peru
as head of Pacific Oil, being the first oil
prospector in the land of the Incas. In
1908 the United British Oilfields sent him
to Trinidad. At the time of his death he
was one of the leading spirits in the
Roumanian oil industry.

1 Passed out in his nineties John N.
Dunn, veteran Ballarat pioneer. Thirty-
six years ago Ballarat East electors displaced
him to make room for Bob McGregor, who
with Aiec Peacock and Joe Ivirton repre-
sented the young A.N.A. school. John Dunn
directed numerous mining companies in his
time, and was five times Mayor of Ballarat
East.
The son of a great Parliamentary figure,
as the late Lord Gladstone was, can always
rely on getting a good start in politics, but
it will seldom take him beyond a certain
point without conspicuous merits of his own.
The G.O.M.'s son rose to be Home Secre-
tary, after 25 years in the House of Com-
mons, but-it was mostly on the strength of
a great name; he was never more than a
respectable plodder. On the other hand,
Winston Churchill and Austen Chamberlain,
whatever they owed to their fathers’ reputa-
tions at the outset of their careers, both
made good by their own driving power.
There was a period when each looked like
a coming Prime Minister; in Winston’s case
it was in the pre-war years when Lloyd
Gedi-ge and he were the outstanding pair
among Asquith’s colleagues, and Chamber-
lain only just missed the party leadership
when Bonar Law succeeded Balfour. The
younger Gladstone never looked a remote
possibility for his father’s job.
Caricaturist FRITH, the humorist who
lately reached The Bulletin from
England via Japan and China.
Lord Kintore’s interest was anchored to
Australia by strong financial chains. Just
before his Ex. was due to leave Adelaide
Government House in 1895, Morton Frewen
came this way to talk bimetallism, and
brought letters from the powerful Gibbses
—the Barons Aldenham, Hunsdon and
Wraxall are all members of that banking
family. Frewen naturally got into close
touch with the Broken Hill people, saw in
the Central mine large chances, talked to
Kin tore about it (Kintore was a very cap-
able engineer), and finally introduced it
to his patrons the Gibbses. The result was
the Sulphide Corporation, of which Lord
Kintore. became chairman and has been
chairman ever since, with Gibbs, Bright and
Co., the Australian branch of the vast
Gibbs organisation, as managing agents.
The list of lucky miners who rose to
affluence in the roaring days of Westralian
mining and presently descended to utter
penury again would be a lengthy one. At
the Bullfinch boom of 1910 there limped
into Southern Cross, along with thousands
of other dusty adventurers, a man who was
credited, 16 years before, with having taken
£150,000 out of the mine that put Menzies
on the map. A swag, billy and tin dish
were all that remained of his possessions.
About the end of last century an enormously
rich deposit of gold was taken out of a

have enriched the original prospector to the
tune of nearly £300,000. The Fortunatus

the gullies for the elusive pennyweight.
William Mansell, who has retired from the
Vic. railways after 42 years of it, had the

He conveyed fish from Port Welshpool to

latter was later to win fame in quite another
sphere by becoming Mayor of Melbourne no
fewer than seven times.
OUT OF THE PAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I came across it yesterday (oh, wasn’t I
a dunce!),
This thing, no matter what it was, that I
believed in once.
My laugh was loud, though it may have rung
a trifle flat,
To think there could have been a time when
I believed in that.
I came across it yesterday, and quaint it
was to see
The poor, neglected, broken thing that started
out with me.
Should I not find it humorous? Can Ibe
held at fault
In that my faith was far too weak to brave
the world’s assault?
For we go up and we go down where’er the
ways shall wind,
And faith is but a puny thing that soon
is left behind.
For gayer company we seek, and bright the
lights ahead ;
Too hard and rough the road of life for our
poor faith to tread.
I came across it yesterday, but I am wiser
now,
With greying hair upon my head and fur-
rows in my brow.
Safe in my wisdom I can laugh at this thing
long forgot.
I came across it yesterday.... I would that
I had not.

“Anopheles”: The news that the Prince
of Wales has contracted malaria on his Afri-
can hunting trip may mean “little or nothing
or much.” There are different brands of
malaria, just as there are different reactions
to it. When the Germans first took over
SHE’D FOUND THAT OUT FOR HERSELF.

MAUD: “Yes, I know —not even Bobby.”
their New Guinea territory, the big-blond-
beast type died like flies at such stations
as Frederichshafen. Further south in Brit-
ish territory the wiry North Queenslanders,
beloved of William Macgregor, stood up to
the inevitable (mosquito infection was then
undreamed of) in much better style. But
oven these took the attacks in different ways.
I knew two brothers of exactly the same
'physique to outward seeming. One used to
shake off the fever without apparent ill
effects, and after a time apparently became
immune. The other went down like a pithed
bullock to every recurrence, and had to be
transferred to another district which was
practically non-malarial.
“Feng-Shui” : Outside medical circles there
are two schools of thought regarding malaria.
One 4s that it is no worse than a bad cold.
This is the view usually taken by directors
of wealthy companies in London, whose
shareholders draw fat dividends from the
labors of employees in fever-stricken locali-
ties. The other is that it is one of the most
insidious curses mankind is heir to. The
malarial germ is a past master in the art of
finding nooks and crannies in its human host
where it may incubate for long periods,
ready to flame up into activity again when-
ever its landlord’s vitality happens to be
lowered. I was four years in the tropics
before I got malaria, and I had recurrences
for three years afterwards. I eventually got
rid of the rigors, but according to my medical
advisers it affected my teeth, eyes, liver,
spleen and kidneys. Diabetes is often one of
the sequelce, and the dreadful blackwater is
said to be only persistent malaria grown
rampant. In the circumstances it is remark-
able that the Prince’s doctors did not pre-
scribe a regimen of quinine. All the cables
mention is mosquito nets, which are about
as efficacious as the daily glass of Guinness
to which a planter friend ascribed his long
immunity.

“Bad Australian’’: The method of knife-
fighting described by “Ida D.” (B. 26/2/’30)
is not greatly favored outside the southern
pampas of Argentina. The northern
tough usually strikes at the left
side, with the knife held at right
angles to his body. The
Chilian roto fights in a different man-
ner and with an entirely different
weapon. He always makes a frontal
attack. Imagine a reaping-hook with
a six- or seven-inch blade straightened
out a bit and ground to a razor edge,
and you have his corvo. The roto
always aims at his opponent’s flank,
and, with a long dragging stroke right
across the abdomen, disembowels him.
On account of its peculiar shape, the
further the corvo is drawn the deeper
it penetrates. I witnessed a case
where the backbone was deeply scored
by the sharp beak-like point of the
knife. I have a corvo that was taken
from a notorious bandido who had 12
known killings to his discredit. He
departed this life shortly afterwards,
with his back to a ’dobe wall and his face
to a firing squad in Santa Rosa de los Andes.
:!: * *
“Sol M.” : An old dramatic type of con-
spirator always commenced by putting the
full conspiracy on paper, after which it was
signed by all parties and planted handy for
the police to find it. The habit was insane
but dignified when it was proposed to blow
up a tyrant, but it is sordid when practised
by five suspected housebreakers who doss in
one room in a slum. When the Melbourne
police roped the party in, duly-signed articles
of association (10 articles) were found on
one of them. It was specified (2) that “the
proceeds after being materialised into cash
be equally divided among the members,” and
(6) “that no member is entitled to any pro-
fits belonging to the organisation.” This was
followed by (7) which stated that “the
business transacted is in the interests of the
organisation and shall be equally distributed.”
One clause declared that no ferocity should
be spared; another that no member should
act alone without first consulting his pals;
and in three separate articles all parties were
sworn to keep dark. Every one of them was
thus authorised to appeal to the Arbitration
Court if his mates turned dog on him. One
young man (not the one on whom the paper
OH, MUCH BETTER!
“Gee, girl, you swim like a duck!”
“Boy, the duck’s not in it with me. I can swim on my back!”
was found) hastened quite needlessly to
give the show away, and to state that the
“Edwards” whose name appeared with the
rest was himself, though his real moniker
was Jones. This failure to keep dark, in
conformity with Articles 3, 8 and 10, spoiled
any chance Jones-Edwards might have had.
The magistrate denounced him as a dangerous
person and ordered him six months, though
it might have been more appropriate to
have described him as an ass and ordered
him six thistles.
* * * *
“Batman”: The queerest “fatigue” I ever
struck happened on South African soil. My
stripes had gone over a little incident in Fre-
mantle, but activity in regard to the ship’s
paper and the organisation of games gave
me a privileged position without them, and
I arranged a football match to take place
in Capetown. The announcement of general
shore leave made some of the best men in
the unit disinclined to play. The 0.C., in-
quiring about the prospects,_ heard about this
delinquency. “I’ll fix ’em,” he said wrath-
fully. “Give me a list of the names and
I’ll make it a fatigue and put you in charge
of it.” And a fatigue it wan made, with a
full (very full) private in command of a
mixed lot, including a W.O. Probably the
whole business was illegal in a military
sense, but it worked out all right.
* * * *
“Kayeff”: If there were anything in the
theory that ghosts are prevalent where men
have come to a violent end, there should
have been a huge output of ghost stories
from among the Diggers. But though almost
every variety of yarn is spun by returned
men, the ghost narrative is conspicuously
absent I have not met a Digger who claimed
to have seen a spook in France, nor even
heard of a “windy” sentry who visioned a
spectre in those dreary night watches when
inanimate things apparently moved menac-
ingly towards a lone watcher. My own dis-
belief in ghosts got a decided fillip when I
woke after a dreamless night to discover
that the slight bump I had used for a pillow
in a strange dug-out was the very lightly
covered body of a German killed —poor devil!
—long before.

“Tuart”: An old Tasmanian firm of
auctioneers puts the matter right in the
Launceston “Examiner” :
We have to advise that the property known' as
——, comprising 426 acres 3 roods, was advertised
by us in error, Mr. -—who instructed us, having
forgotten that he had already sold this property
some years ago.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp”: The Law and I have
grown familiar, so when a policeman loomed
up in the outer office it was only natural
that I should go up to him with my breezy
formula, “Looking for me, I s’pose?” The
officer said something about very few people
taking it in that spirit, and handed me his
slip of blue paper as if he were giving me a
wedding present. I conducted him into the
pub through the side door, and shouted him
a drink —a couple of drinks, as a matter of
fact, since it was hot. Some days later it
struck me that it would be as well to know
the duty on which his Majesty desired my
presence in court, so I turned out the
summons —I had put it in my pocket among
the bills I never open—and found it was not
for me, but for a friend. Moreover it was
for a more serious offence than I am ever
charged with. Now there are complications.
The police, who have got their blessed docu-
ment back, are saying unpleasant things about
my having delayed the processes of the Law
or'sometliing (a bilious inspector, not at all
like my usual genial acquaintances, is saying
most of them) ; and my friend, who swears
he is innocent, talks vaguely about bringing
an action for libellous publication. It is a
vexatious business, and a warning to me
not to take other fellows’ summonses as a
matter of course. And, anyway, I can’t afford
to buy drinks for other fellows’ policemen.
“Sassenach”: It was alleged in Sydney
the other day that great trouble had been
experienced in obtaining the services of a
bagpiper by citizens planning a festival, the
menu of which was to include haggis. The
belief that a piper is necessary to the con-
sumption of haggis is curious, seeing that
the pipes are popularly supposed to be High-
land instruments and the haggis is entirely
Howland. The genuine Highlander’s food,
apart from usquebaugh, was uncooked oat-
meal, varied by salmon, deersmeat and cattle-
flesh, all hastily cooked on the coals. Even
the pipes are only Highland by repute. Ori-
ginally English as far as the British Isles
go, though they were probably derived from
the Breton come muse —Shakspeare contains
many references to them, save in his only
Scottish play—they were almost certainly
stolen by some Highlander in the English
wars and finally adopted by a people desmng
to distract attention from the fact that they
were without trousers.
:J: * *
“Nakh”: Add to the people who make
Bolsheviks the lady who was interviewed by
Melbourne “Herald” concerning the fasting
craze. According to the reporter this interest-
ing member of the leisured classes confessed
that on the sixth day of a menu which many
unemployed would be only too glad to regard
as a square meal she was so snappy that her
maid threatened to leave her. She woke up
thinking of the soldiers in the trenches and
smoked a cigarette to assuage the gnawing
in her stomach. On the seventh day, which
was Sunday, her dinner consisted of two
chops, some lettuce, six slices of cucumber,
half a grape-fruit, two olives, a tomato and
coffee, and the terrible privation made her
dream of meat meals. By the eleventh day
she had lost 141 b. of her 1751 b., and a terrible
tragedy was averted. She had just returned
from a foreign tour, and what with the wel-
come parties, and eating between meals, and
taking her exercise at bridge tables, she had
grown too fat to get into the frocks she had
bought in Paris.
“Lex” : A Sydney man has been fined for
selling “All Quiet,” Aristotle’s works and
other publications which are stocked by the
leading bookshops. The “worst feature of
the case,” according to' the magistrate, was
the giving away with the books of what
are known in the trade as “art noods. ’ Yet
the ladies in these photographs are not nearly
so undressed as the chief ballerine in a
talkie now running in Sydney. This dancer
does her turn in a loincloth and a couple
of saucers. According to decisions in leading
cases, obscenity consists in selling or display-
ing that which “tends to corrupt the mind,’
or which “offends against chastity or
decency.” As nearly all great literature-
including the Bible and the plays and poetry
of Shakspeare—can be brought within those
definitions by any competent prosecutor, the
authorities have hit on a compromise: they
prosecute only those who sell pornographic
works for their pornography. This is equit-
able from every point of view. Pornographic
booksellers get money from the unwary under
the false pretence that the books they offer
are sensationally filthy. In reality, the only
suggestive features of most of them are then-
titles. Many modern novels are much
naughtier than, say, “The Decameron,” yet
no reputable bookseller is prosecuted for
selling them. It is the “intent” that counts
—ancf quite right, too!
CONFUSING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Whole nations are being held up in this con-
troversy as shameful or shining examples, according
to the point of view. Apparently, quoted opinions,
like figures, can prove even diametrically opposite
things.”— “Argus” on the No-License uproar.
I sicken of Septimus Dry;
I weary of William Bung;
Their piteous tales bring no tear to my eye,
My withers by neither are wrung
When arguments fierce are let fly,
Retorts just as viciously flung.
So far as I’ve gathered,
Those lands that are lathered
With foam alcoholic
Are gay, melancholic,
Improvident, saving,
Strait-laced, misbehaving,
All slackers, all triers,
Wise fools, honest liars,
Free slaves and wrong right men,
Soot-black and snow-white men!
When words growing heated and high,
With figures and facts bravely strung,
Prove neatly each statement both truth and
a lie,
I feel—undeniably—stung !
I glower at William Bung;
I frown upon Septimus Dry;
For half a short lifetime I’ve childishly clung
To hope of millennium nigh
When mobs would no longer be swung
By ignorance, bias or lie.
To-day I am learning
How lands that are spurning
The cup which is beady,
Are prosperous, needy,
Chockful of contentment,
Consumed with resentment,
blind-drunken,
Uplifted, vice-sunken,
Good, godly, all’s-well lands
And heading for hell-lands!
When mine after mine you have sprung
To show me, as both of you try,
How t’other’s a liar —well, may I be hung
If I don’t think you’re right, 0 Sir Dry and
Sir Bung!
Yes, both of you right, say I!

“Oran”: Among retiring Maoriland civil
servants with the right to select either a pen-
sion or a lump sum there have been some
unfortunate decisions. A superannuated col-
lector of customs, due for either a substantial
grant or a good pension, chose the pension—
and died within three months. In another
case the choice fell on the cash in one lump,
the recipient putting the whole into what
looked an excellent speculation. He lost the
lot and spent his declining years as a
grocer’s clerk. But one wary old Highlander
who retired on account of ill-health and was
urged by his pessimistic relatives to choose
the lump sum insisted on' the pension, con-
tending that although his days were appa-
rently numbered he came of a long-lived
family. His faith was justified; he drew
the pension for 30 years, just twice as long
as the cash payment doled out on the same
basis would have lasted.

“Vil N.”: The stout lady was stringing
clothes across a Sydney Rocks street which
ended in a rusty corrugated-iron fence. “I
seen y’ ’ad Lil’s new bloke up, Sund’y,” she
shouted, taking a peg out of her mouth and
addressing someone
in the terrace oppo-
site. The reply
came through a

Oils, addressing the old chap. Sliprails looked
surprised. ‘Cows,’ he replied slowly ; ‘jist cows.’
We pulled up near a farm where we could
see pigs being fed. They were grunting and
fighting and scrambling about in the troughs.
‘What are those things?’ asked the fatuous
Oils, favoring us with a wink. ‘Dunno,’
said Sliprails. ‘You dunno?’ echoed Oils,
thoroughly enjoying himself. ‘Well, I’ll en-
lighten your bucolic darkness. They’re pigs,
old man—pigs.’ Sliprails studied his tor-
mentor for a few seconds. ‘ls that wot
they are?’ he drawled. ‘Know wot I thought
they was?’ ‘No,’ said Oils, looking a bit
puzzled. ‘Well,’ said Sliprails, not batting
an eyelid, ‘judgin’ by the noise they’s makin’

mercial trav’lers.’ ”

“Morita” : If quantities of vaccine count
for anything the progeny of the A.I.F.
should be immune
from typhoid epi-
demics for genera-
tio n s to come.
Signed records in
paybooks show that
double issues of
typhoid and para-
typhoid vaccines
were pumped into
me in 1915, 1916,
1917 and 1918.
Small-pox preven-
tion was a bit less
worrisome, but not
satisfied with scars
pf the 1913 scare
in Sydney, the quacks gave my arm further
scratchings in 1915 and 1919. And then
there were a couple of needle jabs to ward
off tetanus. As I heard one Digger put it,
after he’d been punctured in the chest with
a blunt needle, “Yous blokes fossick out
somethin’ fer every blasted thing but wot’ll
make a man’s hide bullet proof.”
“Morita”: Few Diggers ever had to escort
ladies about the line, but I recall one who
brought a couple of giggling charges into
the remains of an estaminet that was our
post outside Strazeele. Half-sliding down
the cellar steps where we were sleeping off
the effects of a long stand-to, he gave us
a minute to don
strides or anything
else we needed be-
fore he brought in
a “coupla shielas t’
meecha.” Still dis-
believing, we had
to dive for the
blankets when he
reappeared gal-
lantly escorting an
elderly madame on
his arm, another
bringing up the
rear. The fair
creatures wasted no
time, on us. They
dived into a pile of
junk stacked at the
end of the cellar
that we hadn’t
thought it worth
while looking over.
Having stowed
small bundles down
their .blouses, they
told their escort
they were “fini,” or
words to that
effect, and he
piloted them up the
stairs again, after
promising to try to
dig up something
younger next time.
He had been de-
tailed off from
H.Q. to fetch the
ladies to their old
home when things
were quiet and get them back from the line
at the toot after they’d salvaged what they
wanted. . “Twig the rifle and fixed bay’net,
cobbers?” said the squire of dames with a
grin. . “Gen’ral ’Aig’s hexpress borders.”

“Tomb”: A shire official at Pialba (Q.)
caught a motorist the other day. He stated
in evidence that the car was a double-seater
proceeding north in the morning, and the
driver failed to sound the horn when turning
a corner. Defendant proved that the car
was a single-seater travelling south in the
afternoon, and that there was no corner.
The Court did not go into the question of
whether the prosecutor was himself or some-
body else.

“Wang”: Two voluble ladies in the rail-
way, carriage going to Brighton (Vic.) had
“Vote for Prohibition” written all over them.
Opposite sat a sturdy fellow in dungarees.
The dames discoursed loudly on the iniquities
of the antis, and men-
tioned, incidentally, that'
their husbands were tee-
total. saying it in a tone
which suggested that the
gentlemen would get a
warm time if they
weren’t. “I’m sure, my
dear,” burbled one to the
other, “that ‘Yes’ will
win. But isn’t it remark-
able, when you come to
think of it, that those we
are fighting will vote ‘No’ because they
have always said ‘Yes’? If they had
learnt to say ‘No’ at the proper time
they wouldn’t be wanting to vote ‘No’ now,
and they’d be happier men to-day.” The
man in the dungarees glared at the interest-
ing pair. “There’d be a coupler ’appier
blokes in the world t’day,” he said, “if you
two wimmen ’ad said ‘No’ at the right time.”

“Klondike”: Mention of telepathy (B.
12/2/’3O) reminds me of a Christmas raffle
that used to be conducted by our village
Bung. It was noticed that members of his
family often clicked for good prizes, but the
numbers were all alike on brass discs, they
were all put together in the bag, and there
was no deception that we could see. One
day, however, the mystery was explained.
Bung’s small niece did the drawing, and she
groped for some moments, looking puzzled.
“Come on, dear,” her uncle remonstrated,
“don’t keep us waiting.” “I can’t help it,”
the child wailed. “I can’t find the ’ot one!”

“Esters”: Some British genius seems to
have solved' the problem of how to get tight
on water. Thames-side pubs now supply a
beverage composed of cheap Australian red
wine and German potato spirit. It is pulled
out of beer engines and sold by the tankard.
A couple of pints bring unconsciousness. It
is at the awakening that the miracle happens.
A swig of water from the nearest tap and the
subject is as sozzled as ever.

“Strict Veg.”: Melbourne has had another
mortuary surprise, the extension of the Vic-
toria Market being responsible. The electric
shovel suddenly began to disgorge bones
indubitably human. ITurried inquiries dis-
closed that the spot was the site of the old
Melbourne cemetery, in which John Batman
was buried. When this particular God’s-
acre was resumed some years ago it was
understood that all its tenants had been
reverently removed to the Fawkner cemetery.
But it was the custom to bury convicts out-
side the sanctified area, and it is probably
the remains of these erring children which
are now being turned over.

“Percy Pawnticket”: “Watch this one,”
the conductor whispered. He had been tell-
ing me tales about pert women passengers
and the way they induced strangers to pay
their fares or tried to dodge payment. “This
one,” who had just boarded the tram, looked
about her like a bird-of-prey, spotted a man
in the next compartment, and climbed along
the footboard to get to him. He was not
effusive, but he did not look surprised, and
paid up. The conductor swung back to me.
“Notice?” he said. “She didn’t even thank
’im fer payin’ fer ’er—took it as a matter
o’ course. The cheek of some of them tabs!’
I watched the lady and her victim with
amused interest, wondering if he would con-
sider that the payment of her fare entitled him
to a continued acquaintance; but obviously
she was too “fly” for that. She said some-
thing about wanting to buy a few things
BARE FACTS.
“Daddy, this is my coming-out frock.”
“H’m—hot with ME!”
before she went home, and left the tram, with
a mere brief smile at the mug. The con-
ductor swung back once more. “She found
you dead easy,” he said to the farepayer.
“They’re too ’ot altergether, some o’ these
women! I’d ’a’ let ’er pay ’er own fare.’
The man sat up stiffly, and his face went
red. “That lady was my wife!” he replied.
The conductor slithered along the footboard
and pasted himself at the rear of the car
trying to look as if he had ceased to take
any interest in the collection of fares.

“Klondike”: Two Melbourne juries have
been called upon to make some delicate
assessments —the cash value of a wife to
her husband, of a mother to children of
varying ages, and of a husband. In the
first suit the lady was killed in a car acci-
dent, and her husband claimed £3OOO ‘on
behalf of himself and his three children.”
The jury awarded £5OO, of which £125 went
to hubby, £B7 10s. to a child of eight, £125
to a five-year-old and £162 10s. to the baby,
aged 16 months. The second case was also
the result of.a car accident, which obliterated
a husband. His widow asked for £2OOO as
his value to herself and his aged parents.
She got £500; the parents nothing.

“Hamer”: English papers now use the
term “Digger” as a matter of course, but
it took them right to the end of the war to
learn that no offence was likely to be felt
at its employment. When I came out of
hospital late in 1918 “Digger” was still
carefully replaced by “Australian soldier in
the papers which published my “copy” ; but
the “Daily Mail” eventually headed an A.I.F.
repatriation article with the line, “Diggers
to Return.” Carmelite House waited for
two breathless days to see if anything would
explode. When no burst of indignation was
noticeable, it flung the word about with
rapture In fact, its bright young men
overdid it • an “Evening News” item announ-
ced that a “Digger” had been charged with
bigamy —and the great lover was a Canadian,
“SUPPOSING”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Your argument seems sound—to you,
Above the standard f.a.q.,
The points well made, the facts well
strung.
And then a voice “above” gives tongue,
A monitory finger’s wagged,
Across the trail a herring’s dragged:
“Supposing, Mr. Leatherlung”
You try the usual “come-back” patter,
“That’s not this case,” “It doesn’t matter,”
“I’ll treat that question before closing.”
As if some vast suspicion nosing,
That finger wags incessantly:
“Your duty is to answer me!
I’ll put the point again. Supposing
“Suppose I buy, or sell, a horse
And draw a bill ‘without recourse’;
Suppose two wager, hat for hat;
Suppose two Irish, Mick and Pat,
Contract and none know what they mean,
And some odd fact should intervene ;
How, Mr. Brief, d’you answer that?
“Supposing facts that can’t exist,
Except by some weird mental twist;
As thunderbolts from sunny sky;
That drunks are sober, pigs can fly;
Suppose one can, even if he can’t;
Suppose your uncle is your aunt;
Then, Mr. Gabb, what’s your reply?”
The curse pursues me in my sleep,
Where wild irrelevancies creep,
Supposititious facts and phrases
That dance about in lawless mazes:
“Suppose right’s wrong, or black is white.”
My answer echoes in the night:
“Supposing red-hot, blithering blazes!”
Oh, I can stand the Judge who dozes,
The one who snaps, the one who proses,
And him who with his fingers fiddles,
Or pen or pince-nez idly twiddles ;
But save me from the mental dance
Of minds made up well in advance
That fill in time composing riddles!

Despite its fantastic theme, “R.U.R.,”
now being done for the first time in Mel-
bourne by the Reps, at the Playhouse, is
interesting enough except when the author
forgets that the stage is not a hustings,
which is often. Still, the piece is sur-
prisingly badly constructed dramatically, con-
sidering that it has added a word to the
language which the “Argus” will some day
be printing without inverted commas. Karel
Capek got a stunning idea when he started
to write a drama round the notion of a
factory manufacturing synthetic human
beings which turn on their makers and
supplant them. Unfortunately Capek is
basically a sentimentalist and he gets way-
laid with the desire to make a happy end-
ing. Il'e deals in symbols and the trouble
with symbols is that when the allegory is
stripped off them they usually turn out to
tie the stock characters of bellowdrama. The
industry of making robots is in full blast
to-day, but there is no danger of their urge
for higher things making them bite the
hand that feeds them with the movies and
other aids to a comfortable existence. The
only time a robot gets really furious is
when efforts are made to elevate him. Then
he rises in his wrath, flings the Government
out on its ear and replaces it with one more
earnestly dedicated to increasing his comfort.
The present presentation is remarkable for
good staging and indifferent acting, two
exceptions in the acting division being Alice
Smith and Frank Clewlow. Miss Smith’s
sympathetic manner is allied with an
academic knowledge of stage deportment.
Mr. Clewlow, as the sole survivor of the
human race, throws the glamor of pathos
over the epilogue wherein the Robots are con-
fronted with the awkward fact that in 20
years’ time they will have become worn out
and, the formula for making them having been
destroyed, they will have no means of
replacing themselves.

Isabel Handley’s play “Handcuffs for One,”
which had its first stage presentation at Syd-
ney’s Savoy on Saturday night, is a comedy
in which there arc no bedrooms, no pyjamas
and no quips culled from the smoking-room,
“The Sea hath its Pearls.”—Sweet Nell of
Manly.
but it kept its audience chuckling merrily
and held its interest right up to the denoue-
ment. The ingredients of the plot aren’t
new—a missing bracelet; three salf-sacrific-
ing souls who confess they stole it, and a
couple of love affairs —but they have been
stirred skilfully and liberally seasoned with
unstrained humor. The young playwright
has a knowledge of stage technique and a
dramatic instinct, and she indulges both
without running into imbecile improbabili-
ties. The female characters are deftly
sketched, and Alathea Siddons as Mrs. Main-
waring, Freda McGee as her daughter Jill,
June Carter as Monica Duff-Barton, and
Katie Towers as Mrs. Stubbs make good use
of the opportunities provided for them, and
subsidiary parts are in fairly competent
hands. The show is promoted by the Actors’
Federation, whose members have been hard
hit by the conquering march of the talkies.
Trimmings include an array of usherettes
who constitute quite a mannequin parade of
evening frocks, and a vocal quartette that
harmonises sweetly between the acts.
Sydney Town Hall was thronged for
Saturday night’s orchestral concert, the big
attraction being what had been loosely
termed in some of the advance mentions of
the show a performance of Beethoven’s 0
minor Concerto with Nancy Weir, the youth-
ful Melbourne pianist, as soloist. The last
movement only was played, the 14-year-old
child at the piano proving worthy of the
very _ fine orchestra that followed Howard
Carr’s baton. Her confidence and courage
are amazing, and there is a maturity, not
only of technique, but of expression in her
playing far beyond her years. For an encore
she played a pretty little piece of her own
composition.
The thirst for eighteenth-century comedy
continues unabated at Melbourne King’s,
where Wilkie is still turning ’em away
nightly. On Saturday he changed from the
gaiety of “The Rivals” to the unsophisticated
merriment of “She Stoops to Conquer.”
Goldsmith’s masterpiece is proving as amus-
ing to the playgoers of the twentieth century
as it did to those of the eighteenth, and it
now has the added attraction of dressing,
which has become unusual. The trouble about
modern comedy is that it cannot undress
its women on the stage more than the audi-
ence undresses in the street or on the
beaches. Hunter-Watts as Kate Hardcastle
looked like a telephone cover. “She Stoops”
will run until Saturday, when “The Jealous
Wife” will start keeping the silverfish out
of the Wilkie wardrobe.
* * *
“Journey’s End,” at the Criterion, is the
only Sydney show over which the shadow
of the axe does not hover. This gripping
war-play has now over 200 Australasian
performances to its credit and present indica-
tions point to it occupying the Castlereagh-
street fortress for quite a while yet. “New
Moon,” at Her Majesty’s, will go into total
eclipse so far as Sydney is concerned next
Saturday, when a 1930 version of “The
Belle of New York” will take its place.
Marie Bremner, who is to fill the title-role,
will be the seventeenth to play the lead in
the piece in Australia. The following Satur-
day (March 22) William Faversham moves
into the Theatre Royal and Leon Gordon,
who has been responsible for “Murder on
the Second Floor,” moves out. Faversham
will kick off with a dramatic version of
Mark Twain’s “Prince and the Pauper.” The
rble of Miles H'endon, a deposed courtier
who befriends the young king, Edward VI.,
will be attended to by Faversham. Ann
Davis will wear the leading lady’s robes.
Those who are interested in whether Aus-
tralians speak with a Cockney twang can
secure evidence on the point by looking in
at the Grand Opera House, where Nancye
Stewart, Mayne Lynton and H. Lane-Bayliff
are holding the fort with “My Old Dutch,”
the play built around Albert Chevalier’s
famous coster song of that name. Eric Hud-
son’s “The Unfair Sex,” a light comedy with
a much tangled _ plot, will make an early
appearance at this house.

The talkies’ victory over the barnstormers
has been a blessing to the amateur theatrical
societies of Sydney. All report larger attend-
ances than usual, as a consequence of which
the enthusiasm of members threatens to
bump tbe top out of the thermometer. In
days of old the am. dram. ass. people took
the stage at long and irregular intervals, but
now they can catch an audience any day of
the week, and are making a steady business
of their play. “The Cradle Song,” which
finishes at the Turret Theatre next Friday
evening, will be followed on March 26 by
C. K. Munro’s “At Mrs. Beans’s,” a comedy
of boarding-house life. - It will be presented
twice weekly thereafter—on Wednesdays and
Saturdays. The same crowd are resurrecting
“Tbe Silver Cord” for one night at the
Savoy, March 24. Half the proceeds will
be given to the District Nursing Association.
The Players’ Club, which has just got
“Merrileon Wise” off its chest, has a fat
programme of play readings and studio even-
ings till June, when Quintero’s “The Women
Have Their Way” is billed to appear at the
Savoy. “Desire Under the Elms” continues
to attract Eugene O’Neill worshippers to
Duncan MacDougall’s Playbox Theatre, where
Miles Malleson’s comedy “Love at First
Sight” is shortly due to occupy the stage.
The Community Playhouse is at present con-
centrating on a series of one-act plays, but
proposes to release a three-acter at the end
of the month.
* * *
To encourage the production of locally-
written plays, the Community Playhouse,
Sydney, has offered the free use of its stage
to Australian playwrights. In response to
the offer, Mrs. Norman Thomas presented
last week her one-acter, “The Flame,” which
deals with prostitution. The subject, out-
side the fascination it exercises on the imagi-
nation of the immature and inexperienced,
isn’t very deep, and this playlet doesn’t cast
much fresh light on it beyond proclaiming
that the prostitute is likely to be a thief,
whereas the principal indictment against her
is that she has taken a horribly unsavory
course of life that threatens quick retribu-
tion to herself and countless others, and which
isn’t a fair alternative to death by star-
vation or cyanide of potassium. In Mrs.
Thomas’s essay, the contrite street-walker
hurls herself beneath a motor-car, which,
though intended to be pathetic, is in fact a
rather sanitary conclusion. Beatrice Wen-
ken, Elsie Brooks, Henry Cornish and Frank
White played the piece commendably.

Isidor Goodman, imported to assist with
the propagation of Paderewskis and Carrenos
at Sydney Con., demonstrated his ability as

his adorable creations.
an executant at the Con. His mastery of
digital problems was established by a sound
performance of the Brahms Variations and
Fugue on a Handel theme, and a very
clear and intelligent reading of Chopin’s B
minor Sonata displayed his interpretative
powers. Honor being thus satisfied, the
audience—and Isidor —settled down to care-
free enjoyment of such dainty little jewels
as Ravel’s “Miroirs,” Debussy’s “Pagodas,”
Scriabin’s “Study in Thirds” and Fagan’s
“Dance of the Harpies.” The newcomer has
a pretty touch and his phrasing is always
clear-cut and logical—assets of especial value
to a teacher.

There was a time in Merry England—
and doubtless contemporaneously in other
European countries —when every gentleman’s
home had its “box of viols” and the perform-
ance of chamber music was a most popular
and pleasurable form of recreation. The
world has since sought out many inventions
and forgotten many of its old delights. To
rescue this one from oblivion is the aim of
the Sydney Con. quartet, which gave the first
of its concerts of the present season one
night last week. W. ,T. Grieves took Alfred
Hill’s place with the viola, Mr. Hill being in
Maoriland (where, by the wmy, he has been
asked to write the music for a Maori
talkie):' The principal offering was one of
Beethoven’s quartets, of which a well-balanced
reading was given. Dvorak’s Quintet, in
which the piano part was played by L. G.
Smith, a composition with a strong Magyar
flavor, was presented with plenty of fire,
and the programme was rounded out with
Beethoven’s seldom-heard song-cycle “To the
Distant Beloved,” tunefully sung by Spencer
Thomas. There was a fair-sized crowd.
Arthur Greenaway’s yearly Shakspearean
season caused the cohorts of Schooldom to
descend on Sydney’s Con. to garner exam.-
points from his version of “The Merchant of
Venice.” Greenaway played his Shylock
seriously—as Australia knows, God wot, it’s
a serious part. Adele Quinn’s Portia suf-
fered from stage pauses. She should attend
the courts and see how nimbly the gent,
one in charge of the defence raps his little
nails into the soft parts of the jury. He
hasn’t got to wait for any salvos of applause.
“Hamlet’’ (for the benefit of Leaving Certi-
ficate aspirants) is promised in the near
future.

Arthur Stigant has temporarily aban-
doned the cultivation of prize chrysan-
themums to assist Gladys Moncrieff in “The
Maid of the Mountains,” which opens at
Melbourne Royal on Saturday. With them
will be Gus Bluett, Lance Fairfax, Michael
Cole, Madge Aubrey and a strong cast of
others.
The Palette
B. E. Minns, an artist of consummate
ability, who has paid more attention to the
Australian abo. than any other of his tribe,
shows some of his latest water-colors in a
little upper room in Sydney’s King-street.
It is an impressive show and one that gives
a more enlightened impression of Binghi
than reams of treatises. There’s an abo.
patriarch who is a ringer for George Dibbs,
and another, in a battered old belltopper,
who could pass, at a little distance, for
Lord George Fortescue de Fortescue —the
sweep of the moustache hasn’t been bettered
by the most nonchalant and useless of our
aristocratic growers of ziffs. And there’s
a portrait of a S.A. abo. decked up in a
Gladstone collar and a nice black suit who
looks almost as statesmanlike as Stanley
Bruce and a lot less rococo than Billy
Hughes. The tragedy of a race that adapted
itself to the life of this large, weird con-
tinent, possibly because it had its origin
there, expresses, itself in all these pictures.
Arthur Streeton’s latest array of pictures
at the Fine Arts; Melbourne, is catalogued
under a variety of titles, but, as far as
ordinary observation went it appeared to be
entirely composed of portraits of the eminent
critic who is writing these comments. The
critic was garbed in a cool white suit, was
well shaven, and had liis hair nicely parted,
and his looks are not entirely repulsive;
nevertheless, he found the repetition of him-
self in picture after picture somewhat super-
fluous. It was disconcerting to find himself
called “Roses” in one picture, “Bunch of
Flowers” in the next and “Mt. Bogong” in
another. In short, Mi*. Streeton still adheres
to the old-fashioned habit of glassing his
paintings. It is positively amazing to find
an artist of his experience following a
custom which makes a possibly sensitive
record of Nature into a riddle of reflections
of irrelevant objects such as carpets and
art critics. It suggests an indifference on
the artist’s part to the finer aspects of paint-
ing and as far as the present writer is con-
cerned it removes Mr. Streeton’s show from
the province of serious criticism. .
The fourth annual Kodak International
Salon is attracting the feet of the camera
fiends to the basement of the Town Hall,
Melbourne. There is a refreshing feature
in the latest show. Fewer of the exhibitors
are worrying about “composition” and
the other shibboleths of artists. There
are fewer pinchbeck Rembrandts, imitation
Corots and more-real-than-the-real-thing Con-
stables. The photographer is beginning to
realise that it is a camera he has in his
hand, not an etching-pencil or a paintbrush.
Consequently, some of the best work in this
show begins to approach the realistic stand-
ard set by the press photographers of the
dailies. .Particularly is this so of the por-
traits of Royal personages and notables, like
Mussolini. Possibly these potentates won’t
allow their features to be monkeyed with.
Mabel Roxburgh was one of the most
vigorous draughtsmen or -women turned out
by the Melbourne National Galleries, but
for years nothing has been heard of her.
Now she appears at the Athenaeum to demon-
Bondi Beach Inspector MAC, custodian of
the blushes of the Pacific.
strate that she has made herself a vigorous
and vital painter. She has the knack of
catching the most vivid aspects of her sub-
jects, and only her failure to unify her im-
pressions prevents her from producing pictures
of the first order. Even her worst blunders
suggest a courageous personality. A baby’s
head is remarkably alive and a man in a
black cloak, his face wiped in with a dozen
nervous brush strokes, is tonally dead yet
alive with character. Miss Roxburgh is uncon-
ventional but without the affectations of the
usual shatterer of conventions. One of her
offences against orthodoxy is the absence of
a catalogue, but as the titles artists give
their pictures are usually meaningless or
superfluous this is another point in her
favor.

In terms of
owner satisfaction
Oldsmobile ranks as
the truly satisfying car
TT has been said that he, who
in ownership finds complete
satisfaction, is the best salesman

proof of that statement could
be found than in the good
opinion which Oldsmobile

choice.
To appreciate Oldsmobile, to
understand Oldsmobile as it
merits understanding, listen to
an owner's selling talk—selling
talk that only an owner could
give.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
This Week’s Investment Tip.
At least half a dozen times a week The
Bulletin’s Free Service Department is asked
whether this or that life office is “financially
sound.” We know what has happened. An
agent has called, and, presently, being chal-
lenged with something The" Bulletin has
(or hasn’t) said at some time or other, has
replied: “Very well, I’ll tell you what we’ll
do. You write and ask them if my office isn’t
financially sound. If they reply yes, then
that’ll satisfy you, won’t it?”
“Financially sound” —what does it mean?
So far as a life office is concerned, not a
quarter of what you ought to know.
When a man or a firm owes you money, it
may be enough for you to know that he can
pay 20s. in the £. That is all you expect
from him: if he can pay you 20s. in the
£ you are satisfied. That constitutes finan-
cial soundness. But a life-insurance office is
entirely different. When you take out a
fife policy you really buy a partnership. So
you are not interested merely in whether
the concern can pay 20s. in the £; you are
personally and directly interested in its pros-
pects. For as long as you live or the policy
lasts you are to have a share in its profits—
if it can make any.
Even the man who is pretty well used to
ordinary share investments often boggles
when it comes to a life-insurance purchase,
lie just as much as anybody needs to get it
firmly into his head that what he is buying
is a partnership; and selection is all the
more important because he is being offered
partnerships in offices which consume more
than half their income in expenses, and in
others which don’t consume 10 per cent,
of it.

Though there were no forays by seamen or
waterside workers last year, the idleness at
West Maitland restricted the takings of the
colliers and greatly diminished the co.’s
investment returns from those pits in which
it is directly interested —it controls the
Hebburn and Metropolitan, the latter on the
southern field, and has holdings in Aber-
mnin-Seaham and B. H. Prop, collieries. But
apparently the losses on the swings were
partly set off by gains on the roundabouts.
After attending to the prefs. and handing
the ords. 10 p.c., the board was visibly able
to plough-in £27,077 of the year’s net takings.
Indeed, the directors claim a trifle more
net profit than for the previous year, writing
the figure at £124,659. Meantime £7418 had
been dropped into the insurance fund, raising
it to £301,679, which the “Wild Cat” believes
is genuine profit and treats accordingly.
In addition, there is an assorted reseiwe
for “contingencies, taxation, repairs and
maintenance, boilers and renewals, super-
annuation, etc.,” which has been built up
as opportunity offered. Recent movements
in this fund have been as follows: —
1924. .. ..£354,502 Increase £7,324

1928 .. . . 407,095 „ 26,882
1929 . . . . 408,047. „ 952
There is no doubt that a substantial portion
of the £408,047 consists of genuine profit
also. Treating the lot as such, last year’s
net result was £27,654 poorer than the 1928
figure. After handing the half-million prefs.
their £30,000, the balance was 13.7 p.c. on
the £750,000 of ord, capital as against 17.4,
18.6, 24 and 13.3 p.c. back to 1925. Over
the last decade shareholders have averaged
13 p.c., sweetened by a one for two gift-scrip
issue in 1922.
In addition to its coal and own shipping
interests, the co. owns half the scrip in
Tasmanian Steamers Pty., Ltd., and is on
Amalgamated Wireless share register. Also
there is £1,208,437 in Government stock,
debenture and other securities. Some of
this was gathered from the sale of tonnage
during the war.

The Westralia, a new motor-driven passenger
ship, was put on the Sydney-Fremantle run
in time to catch the thickest of the summer
traffic. The book value of shipping property,
with which is lumped freeholds, leaseholds
and some shares in other cos., increased
£255,505. Only £12,461 was added to the
debt, cash, book debts, investments and
stores being drawn upon for the balance;
thus the more or less liquid surplus
(£1,016,533) was £227,477 less than at the
close of accounts in 1928.
The ords., for which 465. was asked a
year ago, were recently quoted at 365. Allow-
ing for the final div. the return at that
figure is only 5.7 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.
Obviously the market considers that pro-
spects of a lift in the div. rate are still
bright. The backing amounts to 395. 9d.
in net tangibles. The well-protected prefs.
are steady around par.

This co.’s figures reflect conditions in the
real-estate market. The peak years of the
past decade were 1926 and 1927, when many
properties changed hands two and even
three times, owing to the activities of
American and other speculators. Lately the
market has been readjusting itself, as the
next comparison of combined selling-agents’
figures shows: —

Owing to the tightness of money the specu-
lator was practically squeezed out of the
real-estate market last year, and turnovers
were easier. They promise to be easier still.
Notwithstanding temptation, Richardson and
Wrench has kept strictly out of the land
gamble, confining its activities to valuing
property and putting it under the hammer.
The co. gets its full share of whatever busi-
ness is offering; the shrinkage in its turnover
(£1,225,722) amounted to only £112,622 last
year, when gross profits fell away £3634: —

1923 . . 36,250 | 1928 . . 40,488
1924 . . 33,567 | 1929 . . 36,854
Exes. (£24,286) were £159 heavier, so the
slip in the net result was £3793. The div.
was dropped back to 20 p.c., the final profit
figure being 23.9 p.c. on paid capital as
against 31.2, 34.6 and 36.6 p.c. back to
1926. That was before taking into account
reductions in the contingency fund, shown as
written off in the table.
Finances are snug:—

The growth in liabilities was mainly deposits
on sales (£9075, up £4718). The outside
debt was more than twice covered by cash,
etc., alone.
The absence of goodwill'in the sheet, the
return of one-fourth of the capital without
affecting business earnings in the least, and
the quick rise in property values largely
explain the juicy return to shareholders, and
the high esteem in which the market holds
the scrip. A year ago the 15s. paid shares
were at 485.; recently 425. 6d. was asked
without buyers declaring. At 40s. the return
would be 7.5 p.e. on a 20 p.c. div. basis.
The net tangible backing amounts to 28s. 9d.
per .pound of paid capital.

This co. turned over most of its assets to
Melbourne’s big brewery merger of 22 years
ago; and to represent its £57,600 of paid
capital, £36,735 of visible reserves, and a
trifle (£135) coming to creditors, the biggest
asset is still its holding in Carlton and
United. Of these there are 72,500 ords. and
10,549 7 p.c. cum. prefs.; the latter advance
with the ords. in any distribution beyond
that rate. In the Foster’s balance-sheet they
are in at £84,780 (cost). Other assets are
book debts, £7267; public securities and cash,
£9479.
The position therefore is governed by
results in the operating co. The brisk advance
in Foster’s div. rate corresponds with the
growth in returns from the C.U.8., which
has comfortably paid 174 p.c. for the last
34 years as against only 7 p.c. in 1919. Thus
Foster now gathers £14,533 annually in divs.,
which, with interest, etc., made last year’s
income £15,773. After paying a handful of
exes. (£367), the declared net profit was
26.7 p.c. on paid capital. That, however,
does not represent the full measure of what
the co.’s assets earned. The operating co.
did not distribute £81,423 of its admitted
profits for the year to June 30 last. Of that
amount Foster would be entitled to £3468,
equal to another 6 p.e. on its capital, making
total net earning 32.7 p.c.
Also, there is a .tidy inner reserve in the
C.U.B. scyip. At June 30 last the operating
co. had £1,258,596 of reserves showing, sub-
ject to £BOO,OOO originally paid for the good-
will of the amalgamated businesses, though
much of that froth has been displaced by
internal provisions. Taking these figures
into account, the visible backing for Foster’s
pound shares is 535. 6d. in net tangibles.
The market has no doubts about the out-
come of the Victorian liquor referendum, to
be held in a few weeks, but is more con-
cerned as to the possible effects of reduced
spending and competition from the new Rich-
mond Brewei’y, whose sales are reported
on the increase. The combine, however, is
very strongly equipped for a struggle; it
could show £1,500,076 in net liquids when
the books were last ruled off, an improve-
ment. of £857,308 in four .years.
The highest price paid in the call-room
for Foster’s scrip was 555. in 1926; the
figure reached 80s. last year, but has since
sagged to around 70s. The return at that
price is 7 p.c. on a 24J p.c. div. basis.

When this co. took over the cattle-runs of
the Q.M.E. in 1915 conditions were favor-
able, and divs. averaging 8.4 p.c. were paid
for the five years to 1920. The story since
has been one of mounting costs, lost markets,
drought and falling prices. Over the last
nine years only twice has the balance been
on the right side, aggregate losses exceeding
aggregate profits by £51,615, and since two
divs. were paid to the prefs. a deficit of
£63,158 had piled up at the close of last
accounts.
A few years back wool offered a way out,
so Tarbrax was turned over to sheep. To
finance the change and the purchase of
Springfield, a cattle-fattening depot near the
N. S. Wales border, £107,249 of 8 p.c. cum.
prefs. was issued; and for the next two years
£12,441 more than the prefs. called for was
netted. But drought quickly withered pro-*
spects; agistment and hand-feeding costs
piled up outgoings, and losses again showed up.
Last year all the co.’s properties except
Springfield were in fair condition. Never-
theless the slump in the wool market bit
into earnings, so despite better prices for
cattle the loss on the year’s trading was
£3311 heavier than the previous year’s.
Recent rains and the reduction in shearing
rates have improved the outlook at the pro-
ducing end, while the market for cattle has
improved and beef exports are on the increase.
Still the co. has a lot of leeway to make up.
Because its cattle from the Gulf runs have
not fetched top prices, the co. last year
bought Lyndhurst from the Queensland Gov-
ernment as a resting and fattening depot.
Thus £81,775 was tacked on to the debt: —
1923. 1927. 1928. 1929.

Debtors and cash 6,161 4,246 3,007 4,179
So far as the financial position is concerned,
groupings obscure the view. The book value
of properties and livestock increased £74,974.
Much depends upon the figure at which live-
stock has been written.
The price for the pound ords. dropped
sharply from 6s. to 4s. following publica-
tion of the sheet. The last offer for the
prefs.. which carry approximately 6s. sd.
accrued div., was 145.-—that was a couple of
months ago.

Tiiis co., with headquarters in Melbourne,
makes shirts, collars and so on, and the
piecework system, under which about 98 p.c.
of the operatives had worked for 16 years,
was suddenly scrapped by an Arbitration
Court award early in 1928. Immediately
there was an increase of 10 p.c. in the co.’s
wages bill, although the stall was reduced.
Cuts were made in other outgoings, but they
were not deep enough; and profits for 1928
were lower than for any year except one
since the co. took over the Pearson Law
business 18 years before. However, the out-
look became so gloomy that piecework was re-
introduced, and things began to look up at once.
Gross profits have moved this way:—
1921 .. £49,849 1926 ..' £118,090
1923 .. 111,631 1927 .. 125,167
1924 .. . 126,008 1928 .. 105,461
1925 .. 124,421 1929 .. 117,805
Last year exes. (£96,774) were cut back
£1721; so the net result was £14,065 better.
The prefs.—there are 29,736 7 p.c. A’s and
50,000 9 p.c. B’s —called for £6582. The
balance was equal to 8.7 p.c. on the £165,000
of ord. capital. There was nothing worth
mentioning to spare in the previous year; for
the four years before that corresponding
figures were 5.1, 9.1, 11.3 and 14.5 p.c.
respectively. The ords. got 5 p.c., which
was the average for the last five years, com-
pared with an average of 9 p.c. for the pre-
ceding five.
To what extent, if any, improvement
on last year’s figures can be looked for is
hard to say. For some years to come there
is likely to be much less money thrown about
than formerly. But that does not mean that
we .shall buy much fewer shirts and loaves of
bread; what it does mean is less amusement,
fewer motor rides, etc., and, perhaps, not
quite such expensive or frequent clothing.
This co. may not therefore be a serious
sufferer.
Now look at the position as disclosed by
balance-sheet figures:—
1923. 1927. 1928. 1929.
Capital . . £244,736 £244,736 £244,736 £244,736

Cash, etc. . . 1,868 3,250 2,756 2,253
Recent tariff adjustments may have had
something to do with the increase in stock;
its significance lies in the fact that the past
year’s profit was largely stored on the ■
shelves at Dec. 31. Much therefore depends
upon the value placed on stocks. The more
or less liquid surplus (£107,159, including
stock) was £26,657 stronger than at the
previous balance. The debt is made up of
bills payable (£81,020, up £43,225), over-
draft (£69,632, down £30,302) and sundry
creditors (£13,105, down £10,503).
The market notes the big stock and the
debt and the recent 4 p.c. divs., and pays
only Bs. 6d. for the 10s. ords. Still, allowing
for the div. the return at that figure is
6. p.c. on a 5 p.c. div. basis. The prefs. are
cumulative as to dividends, have priority as
to capital and rank in the order stated. The
net tangible cover amounts to £8 18s. 9d. for
the A’s and £4 14s. sd. for the B's; last
year’s profit was over three times their com-
bined annual requirements. The B’s can
be had around 235., returning 7.8 p.c. The
A’s are at par or a bit under.

Even after 40,000 miles
Willy s-Knight has high resale value.
MANY authentic reports from the used car
market strongly support the claim that
the Knight engine actually grows more
efficient, smoother and quieter with use, and
consequently has a much higher resale value
than other types of engines.
The new 1930 Willy s-Knight sixes are distin-
guished by outstanding beauty of line, color
and finish, and by such smoothness of per-
formance as only the patented double sleeve-
valve engine can give. The price of the new
Willy s-Knight sixes is the lowest at which so
large and powerful a Knight-engined car has
ever been offered. The fewer working parts
and the high compression of the patented
double sleeve-valve engine assure its owner of
absolute minimum service costs, together with
exceptional economy of operation.

What little love the market ever had for
these finance cos. was alienated by the
failure of most of them to live up to their
gaudy prospectuses. No doubt sales, especi-
ally of motor-cars, greatly increased under
the system, thus lowering unit production
costs and reducing the price to the consumer.
The field, however, was soon crowded, and
some cos. have already burned their fingers.
For the investor the lesson to be learnt from
the failures is the importance of manage-
ment. In this respect opportunity for judg-
ment has been somewhat limited by the com-
paratively recent growth of this class of co.,
but in most cases a pretty fair idea of the
quality of the control is to.be had from a
survey of the accounts.
Automobile Finance made an unpromising
start half a dozen years ago. But presently
there were changes, and original plans were
recast; business was extended to other States
on a commission basis, a subsidiary. General
Investments and Discounts Pty., Ltd., was
formed to handle t.p. business other than
automobiles, and altogether satisfactory pro-
gress has been made along what appear to be
sound lines.
Owing to dulness in the motor trade the
parent’s own earnings were less last year,
but the pup made progress. For the 18
months to Dec. 31 it netted £3368, equal to
9 p.c. p.a. on its £25,000 of paid capital,
and divided 8 p.c. Putting the figures on
an annual basis the parent’s income
(£52,614) fell away £5093; and exes.
(£34,883) were, only £2208 lighter. Thus the
net profit was at the rate of 10.5 p.c. p.a.
as against 12.2, 12 and 14.5 p.c. back to
1926. The div. was kept at 8 p.c., the last
of the share-selling exes., etc., wiped out,
and shareholders could see the whole of their
capital and £13,857 besides in net tangibles
at Dec. 31.
Here is the position, with comparisons, as
balance-sheet figures show it:—

The book debts are all represented by hire-
purchase agreements; really mortgages on
future incomes. To escape loss will call for
very careful management. Apart from shares
in the pup, which are covered by net tan-
gibles with a book value of 21s. 3d., the
more or less liquid surplus (£187,457) was
strengthened £3727 during the year.
The pound shares, paid to 10s., are priced
7s. as against 9s. 3d. a year ago. At the
current figure the return is 11.4 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis. The £24,700 of prefs.,
which carry a cumulative 8 p.c. and have
priority as to capital, are not quoted on
’Change.
The Busy Little Bears.
The bears have been busy, especially in
Sydney; and chiefly perhaps because they
have given particular attention to Associated
Newspapers, the evening journals have been
very vehement in denunciation of them.
A bear is a person who sells shares which
he hasn’t got, mostly for forward delivery,
in the expectation that he will be able to
pick them up at a lower price before he
has to deliver them. In the event of a fall
he often isn’t called on to deliver at all:
the buyer simply pays him the. difference.
It is alleged now once again that the bear
ought to be suppressed.
It may be admitted at once that he can
be a public calamity. At the moment when
it is most desirable that people should attack
their problems with hope, if not confidence,
he is liable to be a panic-monger, circulating
stories that are likely to cause a crash and
so put money in his pocket. On the other
hand, he may be a perfectly genuine specu-
lator, backing his opinion that a stock will
go lower, just as a buyer mostly backs his
opinion that it will go higher. There. is
thus nothing wrong about the actual buying
or selling forward. It is the lies that are
liable to be told in order to influence the
market that are wrong. Nobody has ever
shown how the law can deal with the trans-
gressors effectively; but the Stock Exchanges
might and should take them in hand.
What the investor needs to keep firmly
in mind is that, apart from special con-
siderations, the value of a share depends
upon the earning power, financial strength
and prospects of the business concerned.
This fact cannot be overstressed. If more
generally recognised it might prevent the
giving of hasty selling orders,, especially by
those who hold sound stocks in which they
have a well-grounded faith.
Amongst the stocks which have received a
lot of attention on the market lately are
Associated Newspapers, Anthony Hordern’s,
Goldsbrough Mort, General Industries and
Dunlop-Perdriau; the doubt in each case
being whether the old rate of dividend will
be maintained. Dunlops sold down from
275. on production of the last accounts, when
a 10 p.c. div. was paid, to par just before
the interim div. (6 p.c. p.a.) was declared
about a week ago, and they have since
weakened to 17s. 6d. Obviously the move-
ments have been made chiefly on market
whispers.
If managements made a practice of com-
municating to the public all information of
great importance to shareholders, the bears
would have far less power to do damage.
Tooths.
In Sydney the most heavily traded stock last
week was Tooths, the brewery people, who
bought liesch’s business in July last. Shares
with a face value of £1,250,000 were issued
in connection with the deal; at the same
time £485,622 of gift scrip, one for eight,
was scattered, making paid capital
£5,620,598. B’or the last two years the div.
has been at 124 p.c.; to maintain that rate
on capital as it now stands will call for
£702,575, or £68,521 more net profit than
was shown fpr the 12 months to Sept. 30
last. But the doubt has been not so much
about the co.’s ability to earn enough to
maintain the 124 p.c. div. as to whether
the board will consider it wise to pay it.
Since Tooheys just declared their interim
div. at the usual rate, it is now considered
unlikely that Tooths will make a cut in
theirs, due in May next. So the pound
shares, which eased from 40s. to 375. 6d.
during the last fortnight, firmed around the
latter figure, at which the return is 6.7 p.c.
on a 124 p.c. div. basis.
A North Queensland syndicate, with E.
J. C. Hunter, of Herberton, in the forefront,
has obtained a five-years’ concession from
the Queensland Government over some 500
acres on the Palmer goldfield. The con-
cession, which comprises four blocks, in-
cludes crushing mills and mining machinery,
of which there is a considerable quantity in
the May town district. Work is to commence
within nine months, and not less than £5OOO
p.a. is to be spent on development for the
first two years, and £2OOO p.a. for the fol-
lowing three. A start will be made on the
old Louisa, reported to be in good order,
with the machinery in position and ready,
with a little overhauling. Hunter is going
to London shortly to make financial arrange-
ments to open up the field on a large scale.
Meanwhile the syndicate will be formed into
a limited liability co. with a capital of
£20,000 in 200 shares of £lOO each. Of
these the promoter takes 20 p.c. in paids
and £250 cash. j
A lot of money has been dropped down
shafts on the upper Palmer since the great
alluvial field lower down petered out, and
what didn’t go below was left at the top in
expensive plant. If the worst comes to the
worst the syndicate, or the co. to be floated
later, should get a bit back in old iron.

Because of alleged infractions of the
Queensland Petroleum Act, holders of 132
prospecting permits have been before the
Warden’s Court at Roma. The Act demands
that the permit-holder shall commence drill-
ing within one year, and within two years
shall drill one well to a depth of 2000 feet.
Australian Oil Industries, Ltd., A to Z, 26
companies which hold 52 leases, were sum-
moned to explain concerning 50 if their
permits. The Lander was called upon in
respect to one permit near Roma. Four
Victorian cos., the Pt. Addis, Victoria Roma,
Torquay and Roma Downs, were given till
April 3 to explain their position. Most of
the cases were adjourned or affidavits were
submitted in respect to work done. Only one
permit was surrendered; several permittees
did not appear. It is expected that some
of the drilling cos. will be asked to explain
various slight breaches of the Act. Appa-
rently the idea is to prevent the shepherding
of leases.
* * * *
The Chillagoe (Q.) State smelter is to
run for about 15 weeks on silver-lead and
then switch over to copper ore for a similar
period. At the end of the copper period it
is expected that sufficient silver-lead ore
will have accumulated for another turn at
that, and so on. The arrangement is a
blessing to gougers and prospectors, who
need no longer send their stuff to N.S.W.
for treatment.

Not often is London capital told it is not
wanted, but something like that is occurring
in connection with coal-mining in Westralia.
The output of Collie coal is 500,000 tons
annually, of which the Railway Department
takes 400,000 tons. The Wilga Coal Mining
and Carbonisation Co., of London, is prepared
to develop and equip the Wilga field, and has
already been promised a share of the Rail-
way Department’s requirements. But now
the co. is being advised that it would be well
to keep out. What has happened in N. S.
Wales is being quoted: there too many mines
have been opened, with bad results for both
owners and miners. The miners’ and rail-
way unions are frankly opposed to the new
venture, and these parties can play strong
hands in the business. There would be less
cause for apprehension if the coal w’ere suit-
able for export; but it is too friable for that.
# * * *
Another tribute scandal is said to be
developing at Kalgoorlie. Years ago Persever-
ance could not make ends meet, and sorrow-
fully went into liquidation. Then tribute
parties, in which some of the mine officials
were interested, came along and did well —
so well, in fact, that the co. reconstructed
and sent a wideawake person from London
to resume control on its behalf. What hap-
pened on the Perseverance in regard to
tributes is likely to happen again, this time
in connection with the Lake View and Star
and one or two other mines on the field.
:J: ifc :|: »J:
At an early stage of Kalgoorlie’s existence
Lake View South was classed as a failure,
and nobody was impressed with its chances
until Dr. Laver lately found some telluride
ore at depth. H'e has now struck something
which, it is hoped, is a continuation of the
rich cigar-shaped shoot exposed in the adjoin-
ing Lake View about 23 years ago, and from
which £BOO,OOO worth of gold was extracted
in six months. Laver was one of the early
arrivals on the Westralian eastern goldfields.
He was amongst the first to extensively
prospect the country north of Kalgoorlie, and
was one of the pioneers of Laverton. So far
his luck has not been wonderful.
:j! j|t Jjc *
Tindals, at Coolgardie (W.A.), has a good
chance of being raised from the dead this
year. Some Government-subsidised drilling
was recently done on the show, and it is
now reported that a London crowd has both
the inclination and the money to give it a
trial. In the past gold was won from
Tindals by a Melbourne co., but it never
made any money. The shoots were narrow,
rapidly dipping and short 'lived, and the
ground hard. These shoots may improve at
depth.
* * * *
Optimism is soaring again respecting the
value of the old Fraser’s, at South Cross
(W.A.). There is talk of blocks of good ore
standing in the submerged workings, from
which managers used to pay divs. on lOdwt.
recoveries by battery treatment alone. It
is unlikely that they missed much. Still,
portion of the property is worth, a trial.
# * * *
Two years ago Sydney Siam acquired a
property in the Renong district, Lower
Burma. Portion of this, bored and check-
bored to go .721 b. of t. 0., was to be floated
as Thalang Tin, but the actual launching
was postponed until the tin outlook bright-
ened. It has now been announced that the
Thalang property has been handed over to
Associated Tin. The price is £40,000 in
paids in a working co. to be formed with
not less than £175,000 capital. If the
issued capital of this co. at incorporation
exceeds £175,000, vendors are to receive in
f.p. shares at par 25 p.c. of the difference.
Associated Tin has undertaken that a dredge
of 150,000 c.y. capacity per month will be
working on the property by December 31,
1931. Sydney Siam’s directors expect that
the sale, after deductions, will enable, them
to hand shareholders share per share in the
operating co. when the latter is formed. But
there will be a pretty long wait for divi-
dends.
* * * *
Kopah Tin, floated in Melbourne by Siam
Concessions, began digging on. its Siamese
property in mid-February. Paid capital is
£160,075 in £1 shares, of which 12,000 10
р. cum. prefs. and 52,000 ords. are f.p. and
the balance (112,000 ords.) paid to 17s.
Kopah’s property consists of some 480 acres
in the Takuapa Valley, and is on tidal' watgr,
a matter of considerable importance in that
country of expensive transport. Three hun-
dred acres were bored to go 9oz. of t.o. per
с. average depth being 36ft. The ore is
very fine, and the ability of the dredge to
deal with it is a matter of some interest to
shareholders at present. The plant is. a
modern one, the Werf Conrad dredge having
a capacity of 130,000 c.y. per month, and
jigs and classifiers are fitted.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
[Transferred from Service Dept.]
(1) Has cobalt been found in commercial
quantities in Australia? (2) Is there a
market, and, if so, what is the approximate
value of the ore? (3) Would it be worth
working if reasonably accessible (say, 200
miles from coast on rail) ? (4) Is there a
simple testing method ftir samples? (5) Are
other rare earths sometimes found in asso-
ciation? —5180.
(1) Yes, at Mt. Cobalt (N.Q.), (2) There
is a market for clean ore or concentrates of
about 18 p.c. and upwards. (3) Yes, if
your mining costs are reasonable. (4) bis-
solve the stuff in acid; a pink to purple
solution will suggest the presence of cobalt.
To determine the actual contents the elec-
trolytic precipitation method is considered
best. (5) Yes, and often copper. Communi-
cate with Frank Hambridge, 22 Bridge-street,
Sydney.
Is the National Reliance Investment Trust,
Ltd,, now being formed a reliable investment?
What is the best investment for £150? —5278.
There is no such thing as a “best invest-
ment.” What is best for one person may
be not advisable for another. Much depends
on the risks one can afford to take.. If safety
is important, Government stock is as good
as anything at present. The investment
trust mentioned will probably do well. But
all new cos. are more or less experimental.
Nobody can tell positively beforehand what
sort of a job of it any new organisation
will make.
Is there any Australian demand for fel-
spar?—5185.
There is a limited demand for first-quality
felspar at about 30s. per ton, in trucks,
Sydney.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
H. L. Jun.: Only explanation is that, if
it said so, the “Vade Meeum” is wrong. The policy
would reach the figure quoted in 40 years, not
30 years. Other estimates are not the society’s.
....Doll: But you have contracted to pay 20s. per
share, and you are liable for calls up to that amount.
. . ..W.H.W.: Australian Provincial Assurance
(A.P.A.), 77 King-street, Sydney G.W.F.: Asso-
ciated Newspapers never went to much of a premium;
their peak last year was 20s. 6d R.J.F.: You

THE motoring public of the
world has voiced unqualified
approval of the Chevrolet Six
—by buying 1,350,000 of them in
the year 1929. Here is unmistak-
able evidence of the desire of
motorists for something more than
mere transportation.
Each year for the past five
Chevrolet sales have surpassed
those of the previous year by wide
margins. 1929 was the greatest
year in Chevrolet history—due solely
and entirely to the instant public
recognition and acceptance of the
six-cylinder idea as applied to cars
of low initial cost.
For people were ready for six-
cylinder smoothness, power, flexi-
bility, and comfort.
When the Chevrolet Six of to-day made these qualities
available in the field of the low-priced car, the response was
sweeping and tremendous. It did not take long for shrewd
buyers to discover that economical transportation could also
be transportation of refinement, comfort, and quality—with the
Chevrolet of to-day !
To-day, Chevrolet superiority is everywhere acknowledged.
Engineers and motoring experts agree on the fundamental
soundness of its design—and the performance records Chev-
rolet has made attest the manufacturing skill and painstaking
care which enter into the construction of each and every car
which bears the distinctive Chevrolet mark.
This, the greatest Chevrolet in Chevrolet history, is the
greatest value that motordom to-day affords. A real leader
—outdistancing the field—the Chevrolet Six of to-day will
continue to provide these essentials of motoring satisfaction
for which it stimulated demand.
. . . and really satisfactory
in appearance
Just as every Chevrolet mechanical feature transcends
“mere transportation,” so the outward beauty of every model
in the line proclaims the quality car. The knowledge of the
skilled body designer is apparent in the modern streamlined
proportions. Likewise the colourings reflect the benefit of
three years of research and study of Australian likes and
dislikes on this important question. As to interior finish,
fittings, and appointments—look inside and note the difference!

“Bob Hop”: After
Greenhide had inspected
my bee-stung arm he dis-
coursed, “Y’know I got a
theory that them wild
Hitalian bees picks and
chooses when they’re out
on a stinging expedition.
There was two blokes come
up from Sydney about two
year ago, and they kidded
me to take them out to rob
a wild-bees’ nest. They
knowed enough about bees
to come prepared for stings.
One got hisself up in a
white motor-coat and
gloves and th.e other got a
meat-safe one of them
that’s made by sewing mos-
quito net round two hoops.
He put it over his head and
tucked the ends in his
pants. ’E reminded me of
a German pill-box. When
we got near the nest the
bees attacked in massed
formation; they cast a
shadow bigger than the
post office. Then they
divided into two companies
an’ made for the city
blokes. In a second the
white coat looked like an
outsize in pak-a-pu tickets,
and the cove in the meat-
safe was blotted from view.
Then a weak voice from
under the bees says
‘Hogan’s ghost, I’m suffo-
cating ! What ’ad I better
do?’ ‘Make for the crick,’
I says. ‘Go straight ahead
and _ you’ll strike it.’ An’
straight ahead he goes into
about ten foot of water. He
couldn’t swim a stroke, but
he clung on to the hoops, an’ the bees kept
him afloat. I turned round to look for the
other bloke an’ was just in time to catch
him doing summersets over the brow of the
hill. But never a bee come near me.”

“Toggle”: “Yairs,” said-old Tinnope, “if
you’re goin’ shootin-’ best take Jake along
with you, if he’ll follow. He’s sort of com-
pany, and this cold weather he’s handy to
swim in after a duck, if you get one. He
likes a walk, too, but he’s, terrible gun-shy.
A real terror for scarin’ game he used to be,
always stravagin’ round ahead of the guns
erashin’ his big splay feet into dead timber
and failin’ over himself, he was that eager.
We hadn’t the heart'to leave the poor cow
at home, but in the end Ave cured him.” “Put
a charge of shot into the brute, I suppose?”
“No, -Mister,” said old Tinnope. t “That
sorter thing don’t go down on this joint.
One day old Nugget crep’ up on him with a
handful of buckshot, an’ just as Ed fired
his gun, Nugget flung the shot. It hit Jake
on the neck, and he fetched a howl like a
dingo at full moon. It took me an Ed ail
our time to hold him while Nugget made
believe to dig the shot out with his knife,
him lying on the ground yelping and twistm
and tryin’ to bite Ed’s thumb off. Hi, Jake.
Ah, here he comes.” And round the corner
of the store, nervously polishing his spec-
tacles, trotted the little station book-keeper.

of a rabbiter’s hut. It was a gaily colored
jazz-garter, and when I asked its OAvner
why it hung there he told me that it was to

southern toAvn. Then taking it from its nail
he pointed to an irikspot upon it and said,
“That’s her name.” “Ob,” I replied. “Her

and stretching the elastic-ca,used the little

“Wallaby”: Sarah Jumbuck was the oldest

Although he lauded her abilities to the young
fellows of the district no suitors came to
woo the buxom Sarah. Her' younger and
prettier sister was the attraction. “Sarah
must get off .first,” was .Dad’s dictum. Mjim
sighed. “Doesn’t seem much hope. Dad,’
she said. But Dad hit upon a plan. A
few days later the district was stirred by the
news: “Any bloke as’ll hitch up with old
Jumbuck’s daughter Sarah gets two hundred
pounds.” Competition became brisk, and the

“Kappa”: One of the Pacific’s mysteries
is the origin of the great Caroline Islands
ruins, evidently those of what in its day
was a large city. Several expeditions from
Europe have visited the ruins, within the
last 20 years, but about the only
light cast on the matter is that from
the researches of Macmillan Brown, of
Maoriland, who just before the' war dis-
covered amongst the ruins a small tablet
bearing some words in what is believed to
be one of the Turanian tongues of Asia.
BroAvn’s opinion is that the ruins are those
of two cities, side by side, one occupied by
an inferior subjugated race and the other,
built at a later date, by its conquerors. He
asserts- also that there is evidence that the
place was once the capital of a great North-
ern Pacific land mass, now submerged, Avliieh
was inhabited by a populous race. The
time of the disaster Avhicli overtook it and
overwhelmed all but the small portion iioav
forming the Carolines he places as being
somewhere well within the historic period—
probably less than 2000 years ago.

teered. “Come off it,” the dead man’s mate
ordered coldly. “You can save that bit till
you need it for yourself. Wally was a real
steady going old plug. We don’t need no
hell-fire at his funeral.”

“Avon” : The katipo spider, the only poison-
ous creature overlooked in Maoriland by some
prehistoric St. Patrick who left few crannies
unexplored, isn’t quite so black —and red —
as he’s been painted. Recent careful investi-
gations into his tally of offences have shown
that while his tribe is plentiful on the sea-
beaches he doesn’t bite unless he’s sorely
hurt, and then only as a measure of self-
defence. Also, if his bite is freely scarified
and treated with a strong antiseptic—the
Australian snake-bite treatment —there’s
practically no danger. One of the worst
cases on record, Avhich didn’t get into a sur-
geon’s hands till three days after the bite,
when delirium and accelerated heart-action
were .at their height, was cured completely
in three weeks. The female katipo (whether
she’s deadlier than the male hasn’t been
established) is a handsome creature, satiny
black, with a stripe of orange-scarlet running
doAvn the centre of the body. The male is
blackish-brown with a yelloAv marking. Their
habits haven’t been accurately ascertained,
and a theory long cherished that they inhabit
old timber thrown up by the sea lacks
evidence. Maoris won’t sleep on beach-sand
for fear of them, and that’s as far as the
most practical form of research has carried.

“Sucre”: Nosing into flood records, I can
swamp “E.H.S.’s” mark, 70ft. above normal
level, easily. When a cloudburst hit the head
of the Stanley and'Brisbane'rivers in 1893,
Crohamhurst, a Blackall Range village, got
77.31 inches of rain in four days, and the
aftermath was a rise of 92ft. 6iu. in the
waters of the Brisbane River. Now let
Noah trot out his ark.

“M.L.C.” : An ant-colony has been hitherto
regarded as a thoroughly practical example
of the communistic ideal, but apparently
private property, is to be found even in an
ant-hill. It has long been known that cer-
tain kinds of ants keep green flies as coaa t s
and milk them for the honeydew they exude,
but the latest discovery is that an individual
ant looks after a few individual green flies.
In suitable weather, like all good shepherds,
he drives his flock to pasture on the leafy
branches of a shrub and brings them homo
to shelter at night before it grows chilly.
“Toggle”: Binghi was
no husbandman, but he
Avas a miller of sorts,
and if there was one disli
that tickled liis palate
more than another it was
nardoo-cakc. King, the
survivor of the Burke
and Wills expedition,
reckoned that nardoo was
a swamp plant, and the
heresy held; but he was
wrong. Binghi’s nardoo
was made by pounding the
stamens of coolabah flow-
ers in a primitive mortar.
As they pounded, the gins
added a little Avater, and
the mixture that resulted
was baked in the ashes.
The coolabah has not the
strong eucalyptus flavor
of most of the gums, and
there is a good deal of
honey in the flower to
make it palatable. It has
a long flowering season,
too, odd trees coming out
at any time of the year.
It must yield a terrific
lot of stamens, an im-
portant item Avhen one
remembers that it takes a
lot of tucker to make an
impression on a black. On
the other hand, the so-
called nardoo plant does
not yield anything of
value that I have been
ah l " to discover.

“Lot 13”: Jacky, our
station abo., was potter-
ing round the new engine
and put a finger on the
spark plug. “Wow, Boss,”
he yelled. “Dcbbil bite-
it!” IvnoAvledge is power,
Jacky had found out
something, and itched to
pass the information on.
The only mug in sight
Avas his own disreputable
hound, but what more
suitable victim? Chuck-
ling in delighted antici-
pation, Jacky clasped the
mongrel in his arms and
carried him to the engine.
A reluctant paAv Avas
planted ruthlessly on the
plug, and instantly the
grin was wiped from
.Jacky’s face and tAvo
bloodcurdling yelps, one
from the hound and one
from Jacky hit the wel-

“Sir Spen”: “Pick’s” par. about snakes
“slithering downhill” (B. 26/2/’3O) takes
me back a good many years to a ’roo-sliooting
expedition in the ranges at the head of the
Hunter River (N.S.W.). Going down a
steep mountain slope, I set my foot along-
side a burnt-out stump. I heard a vicious
hiss, and was horrified to see a large black
snake coming at me. I bolted downhill and
got a good lead on the wriggler at the start,
but it didn’t take me long to realise that
he was gaining ground. I felt he must over-
take me in the next few strides. Just then,
as if by instinct, I wheeled along the moun-
tain side. Mr. Wriggler wheeled, too, but I
quickly discovered he was no match’ for me
on the upgrade. Forthwith I despised him, and
let him have one in the middle from my .32.

WAITIN’ FOR THE RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s lots o’ little clouds about,
Like muslin in the sky.
They’re all the colors you can-think —
The palest green, the palest pink,
But not a movement in the lot!
The sun’s a-sinkin’ to the sea,
No breath o’ wind in any tree;
The grass is dead, the ground’s reel ui,
An’ ev’ry bush is parched with- drought
An’ seems to leant to die!
There won’t come up a thunderstorm,
Not with them kind o’ clouds.
The sort that busts an’ fills the tanks
Are black an’ white in solid ranks
That ’urtle on against the wind
An’ send the silver lightnin’-flash,
An’ echo to the mighty crash
That leaves you feelin’ deaf an’ blind,
With air that’s cold an’ rain that’s warm
An’ falls in heavy shrouds!
Them little pinky muslin things
That ’angs above the plain,
An’ w’irly-winds that walks about
Won’t never make the waterspout!
The ants is shiftin’ up the trees ;
The noo moon’s lyin’ on- ’er back;
Me fiddle-guts ’as all gone slack.
Ale corns is achin’, so’s me knees.
Hey, come on, Ilugliie ! Pull the strings!
We want a foot o’ rain ’

MAILS BY MOTORS
An Amazing Public Service
THE motor car is one of the greatest
* assets of present day life, and in no
direction is the automobile doing finer work
than in the transport and distribution of
His Majesty’s mails throughout Australia.
Along some 114,000 miles of highways that
thread their way even into the far-flung
back country of the continent _ messages of
friendship business correspondence - and
other mail matters are ever on the move
to their destination, transported by fast
efficient motor cars and trucks helped in
their national work in no small manner by
the rugged strength and dependability of
Australia’s popular tyre, DUNLOP.
All told, 8,866,339 -miles are covered
annually in Australia by automobile mail
couriers, equal to an average of 2,429 miles
per day. Swiftly, surely and economically,
motor mailmen travel along 1,836 Australian
mail routes, materially helping to make life
more friendly, more worth while and
Australia more prosperous, by reason of
their enterprise and efforts in expediting the
transport of a large percentage of the huge
volume of mail matter that is ever flowing
through the channels of communication
controlled by the Federal Postal Authorities.

SOON PARTED.
“The fool and his money are soon parted” is as trite a quotation as
could be selected, but it has the disturbing effect of being so true that it
cannot be disregarded.
No financial institution, least of all a Savings Bank, could advocate that
money should be saved only and not spent. It is true that wise spending
is as necessary as wise saving, but it is quite obvious that the saving
must come first.
That is where the widespread service of the Commonwealth Savings Bank
of Australia comes in. It provides every facility for the circulation of
money under the easiest and most profitable conditions.
Every Post Office in Australia is an Agency of this Bank, and in every city,
every town, every district in the Commonwealth the Savings Service of the
Bank is made available to the people.

“Q.E.D.”: The premature locking of the
Murray waters in the Hume dam has given
rise to a growth of algae that smells to the
heavens and makes the water barely fit to
wash in. Hence this advertisement in the
“Riverina Herald” of Echuca: “Guaranteed
Goulburn water, 4 gallons, 6d.; 50 gallons, 55.”
“Toggle” : While storekeeping in the N.T.
I got an order for 3001 b. of hobble-chains, to
be posted to the purchaser in 31b. packages,
the order to be repeated each
mail till further notice. Dur-
ing the wet mails go by pack-
horse, and though the contrac-
tor is bound to carry parcels
up to 31b. in weight, he natur-
ally does not like them. What
had happened was that Mr.
Cattleman, having fallen out
with the mailman over the car-
riage of a bag of sugar, had hit
on a meahs of revenge. Post-
age was fairly heavy, but he
reckoned he could outlast his
enemy, and he won. Paced
with an endless train of 31b.
parcels for which he didn’t
receive a penny, the mailman
sold his contract.
❖ *i:
“Dr. Nil”: Old Rashe didn’t
remember when he first came to
his shanty on the Roly-Poly
Plains, nor how long he had
been there. Neither did any-
body else. His memory was wot
too good in any respect. In
fact, barring that he was still
alive he couldn’t remember any-
thing from day to day. His
nearest neighbor, 20 miles away,
used to drop him out-of-date
Bulletins once a month or so,
and the old man studied them
from “red to red,” as all good
bushies do. But, having care-
fully perused a par. or poem, he
promptly forgot it, and if some
caller asked him, “Did yer see
that in The Bulletin about
?” Rashe could never be sure
whether he had done so or not.
So he used to tick the items off
with a pencil as he read them.
When he had gone clean through
a copy and marked everything,
he would commence at the be-
ginning and tick ’em off again.
Once the boundary-rider asked
him if he had seen a par. in his
last B. about himself. Rashe
said he didn’t know, but that
he would soon find out. He
produced the copy, and after
going through it carefully, said :
“ ’Ere it is. In the Abo. page.
But all the other bits ’as got
seven ticks to ’em, an’ this one
’as only six. I must ’ave missed it.
THE PURPOSE OF THE PARABLE.
AVANA: “What did the missionary mean by his sermon on the wise and foolish virgins?"
AUNA: “That was very plain. He meant that we should always be on the lookout for
a bridegroom.”
“Medicurse”: Alf works in a factory and
for some months has had pains in his back
from bending over a machine. This is clear-
HER MISTAKE.
ARGUMENTATIVE MOTORIST (after slight accident): “My dear woman, you were to
blame, standing in the road and gaping about.”
WOMAN: “Excuse me, I wasn’t gapin’ about; I was inhalin’ a cab.”
ing up, but in the last few weeks he has
found that his mouth has become dry, he
is very thirsty, it hurts him to swallow, his
vision has become blurred and he sometimes
sees double. He walks a little unsteadily.
He wants to know what is the matter with
him. It “ain’t booze, worse luck.” He is filthily
dirty, his socks actually cling to his feet, the
wrinkles of his skin are thick with the dirt
of ages, but he is not worried about that!
Inspection retrieved a long-forgotten bella-
donna plaster on his back, which he had put
there some mouths before for his lumbago.
He has been absorbing belladonna ever since
and this accounts for his blurred vision, dry-
ness of mouth and uncertain gait. He washes
his face every day. “You gotter wash the
face and ’ands every mornin’ at the factory,
Doc.,” he explains. But he has not had a bath
for the unbelievable period of four months.
In another month he would have been like a
doped racehorse. Atropine, with which race-
horses are .usually doped, is the active agent
in belladonna. A belladonna plaster has good
uses for a short while, but Alf overdid it.
I removed his plaster and gave him. a tonic
and some good advice about cleanliness in
relation to godliness. But I think Alf has
already become an aqueous atheist.
* * * *
“M.M.”: On the road from Gunnedah to
Coonabarabran (N.S.'W.) the two thickest
boughs of two gum-trees whose trunks are
30 feet apart crossed one another in the
dim past and have now become firmly grafted
and grow as one limb, forming an arch 20
feet above the ground. These boughs are
now slowly but surely drawing the trunks
toward each other, and I hope I live long
enough to see the big wrestling match when
they meet.
* * * *
“Fernie”: The colonising Englishman
doesn’t take many tips from the earlier in-
habitants of the regions he appropriates. In
Maoriland, where the newcomers butted into
a civilisation not devoid of crafts and arts,
two of the three notable concessions the
whites made to the browns were the adop-
tion of the greenstone tiki and the huia
feather as means of adorning the watch-
chains and felt hats respectively of the
younger and flashier male generation—both
were used so inappropriately as to evoke
fat chuckles from Hori and Henare and deep
curses from the men and women of an
older Maori generation. The third conces-
sion was the adoption of the “Maori kit” —
a simple little bag of woven flax, rectangular,
with little rope handles where they would
do most good. Decorated with woven inlays
of black —the body was of white flax —they
were in universal use among the white set-
tlers up till the end of the “hungry
’eighties.” Even Mrs. Gridiron Squatter
(whose husband had “selected” some of those
alternate lots fringing the new railway line,
and who was getting rich quick as a con-
sequence) deemed it only natural and proper
to do her shopping with a flax kit. You
could get a big one for fid. and a regular
outsize whopper for 9d., and the wahines at
the pa who wove them were well content
if they got 2d. apiece after the white middle-
man had combed his profit. But those days
have gone, and though you’ll find a bunch of
the kits hanging on a nail in most country
stores in Maoriland, their use is left to the
kids, who use them as schoolbags only if
their parents can’t stump up the price of a
leather one.
* $ * *
“Karaway”: Some of Sydney’s bathing
resorts, particularly around Botany Bay,
have lately been invaded by swarms of the
minute jellyfish known to surfers as sea-
vermin or water-lice. This microscopical
terror is armed with tiny barbs whose action
on the skin is similar to that of stinging
nettles, and causes a torturing itch that
lingers for hours. Various species of small
stingers are common in northern waters, but
this invader was a stranger to southern
beaches till about 10 years ago. As the
nuisance is invisible it is more dreaded by
many surfers than the blue-bottle.
* * * *
“Pick” : What by observers is mistakenly
regarded as frisky play in wild animals is
usually hard work. When rabbits come out
of their burrows and prance zig-zaggingly
about, their object is to unload their fur
of the dirt they convey from the tunnels
below. Hares rear themselves erect, pirouette
on their hind legs, bowing and gesticulating
with their forepaws, not for fun, but in an
endeavor to reconnoitre high over the reeds
and tussocks when they have detected the
scent of an enemy wafted on the breeze.
When dingoes spring from their lair to race
about the flat, roll over and over and crawl
amongst the bracken, they are trying to rid
their coats of flies, ticks and other torment-
ing encumbrances.
CUTTIN’ SCRUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’d pad the hoof for yacker
From Camooweal to Hay,
Or smoke belah terbacker
A dozen times a day ;
I’d shear a thousand cobblers
Or pass an open pub,
But not for seas of nobblers
Would I go cuttin’ scrub.
I did it once for Hogan
Who managed Lalla Rookh,
In drought-time down the Bogan
When things were pretty crook,
Where stock was poor as matches
And tanks were dried to mud,
W here sheep were skinned in batches —
A land of sweat and blood.
To hang on by a whisker
And wield an axe at that,
You’ve got to be far brisker
Than any acrobat.
And while you hang suspended
The friendly little ants
Find places undefended
Between , your boots and pants.
The flies are very chummy
About your eyes and ears:
They’d stir a tailor’s dummy
Or move a statue’s tears.
The sweat-drops nearly blind you,
_ You suffer cramps as well;
Nobody need remind you
Of what it’s like in Hell.
And while you ply your hatchet
The starvin’ mob below
Watch every sprig and snatch it
To disappoint the crow.
The minute that they’ve found you,
Like clouds of dirty smoke
The dust will sway around you
Until you fairly choke.
And so I’ll take on borin’,
Punch postholes out o’ rock,
Or while the bush-fire’s roarin’
I’ll muster starvin’ stock;
I’ll live on phosph’rus bunny
Or any rougher grub,
But not for mobs of money
Will I go cuttin’ scrub.

Information Sought.
(1) To become a barrister in Q’land, is
a high-school and uni. education necessary?
(2) How to set about becoming a barrister?
(3) About how long would it take to qualify?
(4) Is 21 too okl to start?- —5017.
(1) Desirable, but not essential if the
preliminary literary qualification prescribed
by the regulations has been complied with.
(2) Write.to the Under Secretary of Justice
asking for a copy of the regulations relating
to admission to the profession. (3) Assum-
ing all examinations were passed and articles
served, about five years. (4) No. Earlier
would be better, but many now successful
men have qualified later.
(1) Books on the valuation of land and
buildings. (2) Principles on which valuers
proceed ? —5002.
(1) C. A. Webb’s “Valuations of Real
Property” and “Valuation of Land and Com-
pensation,” by Collins. A useful con-
tribution was a lecture delivered by A. L.
Hinton, which will be published in a new
magazine, “The New South Wales Valuer.”
(2) The valuer investigates recent sales of
similar properties in the locality, making due
allowance for defects, access, services, con-
ditions of sale, improvements, their type and
suitability for the locality, their cost and
depreciation, and the demand for such pro-
perties. The valuer should also be pre-
pared to advise his principal on the prospects
and anticipated returns of the property.
What are the average earnings per week
of the miners at Rothbury (N.S.W.) ? —4984.
Daily-wage employees receive from 17s.
6d. to 245. 4d. per day, and work 11 days
per fortnight. Contract men are paid at
varying tonnage rates according to the char-
acter of the plage worked. The rates for
solids are: Miner, 2s. 7.15 d.; filler and
■wheeler, Is. 8.825 d. per ton, a total of 4s.
3.975 d. per ton. Average experienced workers
should obtain an output of 60 tons per week
and thus earn £7 15s. 9d. and £5 4s. Id.
respectively.
My four-year-old cattle-dog has been cough-
ing for two or three months. He is in poor
condition, and eats earth. He seems to be
trying to dislodge something from his throat,
especially after working. What's the cause
and cure? —soll.
.Can’t definitely diagnose cause without
examination, but suggest the dog should be
dosed with the following capsule first thing
in the morning on an empty stomach: Calo-
mel Igr., arica-nut 15gr., extract of male
fern 8 drops. After administration of cap-
sule, give _ one tablespoon of castor oil.
When medicine has operated, give a sgr.
tabloid of pepsin, bismuth and charcoal in
powdered condition in feed daily for a week.
Feed on meat, milk, gravy and green, vege-
tables.
My kelpie dog was bitten on the ear by
a bulldog some weeks ago, and the ear is
much swollen, and at times breaks out at
the points where the teeth entered and pus
follows. What’s the remedy? —so4B.
Use the following lotion: Chloride of lime,
one teaspoon ; boraeic acid, one teaspoon ;
and hot water Soz. Mix. Apply once daily,
and then dust mattery places with a powder
consisting of equal parts of chloride of lime
and boracic acid.
How are kurrajong, wilga and native-pine
trees grown f / have tried to raise them
from seed without success. —4B73.
The trouble mostly met with in germinat-
ing kurrajong seed is that the seed is not
fertile; this can only be determined by an
expert. Plants cannot be grown from cut-
tings. The difficulty in germinating wilga
seed is its extreme hardness. It can be soft-
ened by dropping the seeds into boiling
water, allowing them to remain until the
water is cool, or the seed should be harvested
and sown before becoming too hard. The
seed of the native pine, like the kurrajong,
must.be fertile and then sown in light sandy
soil in pans or . boxes and the young trees
planted into their permanent positions when
a few inches high.
(1) Suitable paint for the roof and walls
of a galvanised corrugated-iron building near
the sea? —5012.
Clean off salt deposited by atmosphere
and apply one coat of aluminium paint fol-
lowed by two coats of grey oxide roof paint.
What is a distich?- —5137.
A distich is a straphic group of two lines,
such as a Latin elegiac couplet, hexameter
followed by pentameter. An English rhymed
couplet may be called a distich, e.g. :■ —
Men some to business, some to pleasure take,
But every woman is at heart a rake.
Pope will supply you with a few thousand
more examples.
(1) How could a Q’land State school
secure samples of Q’land timbers at a low
cost? (2) What xvould portions Gin. by 'Sin.
by Mn. to 1 in. cost? (3) How to season
after sawing? (4) How to produce a smooth
surface? (5) Best polish or varnish? —49l9.
(1) Framed sets of 24 polished samples of
Q’land timbers are made available free by
the Forestry Department to State schools
within the State. Application must be made
by the head teacher. (2) Other sample sizes
can be supplied at cost. The size stated
would cost 9d. each. (3) After sawing, green
samples should be greased and dried in a
cool place under cover to prevent air and sun
checking. It is advisable to saw the blocks
a little larger than the required size to
allow for shrinkage. (4) Dress samples with
a . plane and finish with a scraper and fine
glasspaper. _ (5) Polish with French polish
(shellac dissolved in methylated spirits).
This is a tradesman’s art. An amateur should
use a hard, white, spirit varnish.
Is water collected in metal receptacles
equally as good as water collected in china
dishes for the purpose of topping accumu-
lators? —4987.
When distilled water is not available, rain
w4ter caught in glass or earthenware basins
may be used. Metal receptacles should not
be used, as minute particles of metal or
metallic oxides may enter into the water and
injure the accumulator.
Is there an Australian mulberry that
ripens during October ana November? If
so, what relation is it to the English varieties
which ripen in Auckland (ALL.) towards
the end of January? —4B66.
There is in Australia a native mulberry
( Oudrania javanensis), commonly known as
“Cockspur thorn” or “Fustic,”' which has
yellow fruits very closely resembling the true
mulberry except that they are rounder. The
species belongs to the same family as the
true mulberry, Aloracew. The fruits are
sweetish when fully ripe, during the latter
end of November.
Why is it that the sights of a rifle are
not changed when the cartridges are changed
from short to long? The long cartridges when
fired should have a flatter trajectory than
should the short. If the difference in weight
of the bullets counteracts the difference of
the charges, what is the advantage of long
cartridges over short? —sol6.
The variations in trajectory are not suffi-
cient to necessitate changing sights. In the
case of the .22 calibre, the short smokeless
cartridge has a bullet weighing 30gr. and the
long 35gr. The velocity at muzzle is re-
spectively 912.551 b. and 936.351 b. per sec.;
the energy at muzzle expressed in foot-
pounds is respectively 55.481 b. and 68.151 b.
The trajectory for 100yds., measured at
50yds., is respectively 6.13 in. and 5.714 in.
—a difference of less than half an inch.
. How to mix red oxide paint for galvanised-
iron roofs, to give durable wear under
extreme heat, heavy rains and appreciable
drop in temperature during winter months?
—5013.
Mix the red oxide (in oil) with linseed
oil and driers in the regular manner and
add 6oz. to Boz. of aluminium powder to the
gallon of paint. This will have the effect of
hardening the paint film.
Does 100 per cent, humidity mean that the
atmosphere is charged with so much moisture
that it is impossible for it to hold anu more?
—4997.
Yes, but it must be borne in mind that
the amount of moisture which the atmo-
sphere can hold increases as the tem-
perature increases. At 40deg. Fahr. the
atmosphere can contain no more than 2.86
grains to the cubic foot, but at 70deg. the
same quantity of air may contain up to
7.99 grains. The figures 2.86 grains and
7.99 grains equal 100 per cent relative humid-
ity at 40deg. and 70deg. respectively.
Relative humidity, therefore, indicates that
the moisture content equals so much per cent,
of the amount which the air can possibly
contain at that temperature.
(1) Is it possible to manufacture wheel-
barrows in Australia? (2) If so, why does
the N.B.W. Irrigation Commission use v;heel-
barrows imported from U.5.A.? —4928.
(1) Yes. There are dozens of manufac-
turers. (2) The Commission states that out
of 28 barrows purchased in the last 12
months, 27 were Australian-made and the
odd one was of British manufacture, of a
type not obtainable locally.
Method of ridding a lawn of paspalum
grass?— sl97.
The best method is by means of a “daisy
drawer,” rooting the plants right out. It
may be destroyed by spraying with sodium
chlorate in a 10 per cent, solution (lib. to
lgal. of water), but this also kills other
grass with which it comes in contact.
(1) If, at a meeting of ratepayers held in
connection with N.B.W. District Council mat-
ters, there is net time to complete the business,
would it be in order to adjourn the meet-
ing? (2) Would it be in order for a rate-
payer to move the adjournment, or should
a member of the District Council propose
it? (3) A petition signed by the required
number of ratepayers is sent to the chair-
man of a District Council requesting him
to call a meeting of ratepayers to discuss
District Council matters. The chairman
objects to call a meeting. What can the
ratepayers do in the matter? (4) At a
ratepayers’ meeting the chairman (who is
chairman of the District Council) vacates
the chair and leaves the meeting without,
declaring meeting closed. Would it be in
order for the ratepayers to elect another
chairman and proceed? —4B72.
(1) and (2) Depends whether there is
any provision in the by-laws of the District
Council for an adjourned meeting of rate-
payers if the business is not finished. (3) If
the chairman or any two councillors fail
or refuse to call a special meeting of rate-
payers for the space of seven days after
receipt of a petition, any three ratepayers
who signed the petition may call the meet-
ing. (4) Yes.
(1) What type of aeroplane was the
Kookaburra? Name and address of Aust.
agent? (2) Wliat advantage has a mono-
plane over a biplane? (3) Why are mono-
planes always used on trans-Atlantic flights?
(4) Makers of and agents for three-seater
planes? (5) Would agents teach intending
purchaser flying free of cost? (6) What
license must be held to carry paying pas-
senger's? (7) Length of flying experience
required before license is granted? (8) Can
slotted wings be fitted to a monoplane?—
4677.
(1) High-wing Westland Widgeon two-
seater monoplane. Cirrus Mark II engine.
Agent: Milton Kent, 19 O’Connor-street,
Ilabcrfield, Sydney. (2) Greater visibility,
less resistance, due to lack of struts and wires,
and ease of maintenance. (3) They have of
late been specially developed for long-distance
flying. (4) Ivlemme monoplane; agent: H. C*
Ittershagen, West Subiaco, Perth, W.A. De
Souter monoplane; agent: A. W. Gregory,
Aerodrome, Mascot, N.S.W. Simmonds
Spartan biplane; agents: Robert Bryce
Pty., Ltd., 482 Collins-street, Melbourne, C.l.
(5) Possibly. (6) and (7) If the intention is
to carry paying passengers you must be in
possession of a Class B (commercial) pilot’s
license. An applicant before qualifying for
a Class-B license must have had at least
80 hours’ solo flying experience. He must
also pass a technical examination and be
passed as medically fit. (8) Yes.
I have a white cockatoo about 14 months
old whose feathers rot in the quill and won’t
mature. He is practically naked, and his
beak is overgrown, but otherwise he is healthy
and a good talker. Fed on sunflower seed
and corn since able to feed himself. Caged
only at nights. What’s the trouble? —4830.
He has a skin disease which is quite com-
mon with birds in captivity. Discontinue
feeding on sunflower seed immediately; this
feed is far too heating. Feed on whole corn
and canary seed, mixed, together with an
apple or pear core, thistles, etc. Delete all
feed in which fat is contained.
(1) How to qualify as a conveyancer? (2)
Any books applicable to N.B.W. conditions?
—4933.
(1) An examination is held in June of
each year and sometimes, if circumstances
warrant it, in December. Full particulars
may be obtained at the office of the Master
in Equity, Elizabeth-street, (2)
Millard’s “Law of Real Property in N.5.W.,”
Millard’s “Law of Personal Property in
N.S.W.” and Hogg’s “Conveyancing and Law
of Property in N.5.W.,” together with pre-
cedents used in conveyancing and additional
textbooks, a list of which may be obtained
at the Master’s office.
It is proposed to launch a fortnightly trade
( engineei'ing ) journal. (1) Is it necessary
to copyright title? If so, method and cost?
(21 What other legal formalities must be
observed? (3) Is it advisable to hand over
distribution to a firm of wholesale distribu-
tors, or are other methods advisable? —-4964.
(1) The title as it appears on the paper
will have to be registered as a trade-mark
(2) The printer and publisher must be
registered and two other persons as sureties.
Leave (1) and (2) in hands of a solicitor,
as legal formalities must be observed. (3)
Advisable to employ wholesale distributors,
who will advise you on other points raised.
Does Anybody Know?
H’ow to prepare strychnine baits for
poisoning dingoes ?—4965.

Coming Tour of Joe Kirkwood
and Walter Hagen
It will be noticed during the tour of Joe Kirkwood and
W. Hagen through Australia that Joe Kirkwood always uses
the Spalding ball. Not only this, but he now always plays
with the new Spalding Cushion Neck Steel Shafted irons.
Playing with these clubs, and the Spalding ball, Tommy
Armour—the famous American professional—on January 8,
1930, at Hollywood, California, made a new course record
of 59 on Harold Lloyd’s private golf course.

MULTI DOT
GOLF BALLS
with the Jew Granite ~ hard Paint
THE special feature of 1930 Spalding Kro-Flite Golf Balls is
the New Granite-hard Paint, which is processed by a newly-
perfected automatic painting machine installed at the Sunshine
factory. This entirely eliminates all hand work on the balls,
with the result that the quality of the painting is such as to place
the Kjro-Flite on the pinnacle of perfection.
So great is the confidence in the universal satisfaction
which the new paint will give, that we have extended the
Guarantee of 72 holes to specifically include the painting on all
Spalding Kro-Flite Balls.
(N.S.W.) PTY - lTO *
332 Kent Street,
Sydney.
After being painted under the new
automatic process at the end of last
season, a quantity of Kro-Flite Multi-
Dot Golf Balls were rushed to
Adelaide for the Open Championship.
It is common knowledge, of course,
that the Kro-Flite won the Open
Championship.
ON PUTTING
Golfers worry too much about their style of
putting. This spoils their concentration.
Get a style in which you are comfortable.
Study the line. Keep your head and body
still and concentrate on hitting the ball into
the hole. If you have a putt uphill where
the line looks straight remember the ball will
always swing slightly to the left, but down
hill it will swing slightly to the right.

Farm Accounts.
A week ago we got on to the subject of writing up the modest little books we
nave opened. We had found that we should need three of these—a Diary, a Journal and
a ledger. Wie gave one example of how a transaction was handled; now we come
to another.
EXAMPLE 2.—H. Harrow intends to start a farm. He buys a block of land
without a fence or improvements of any kind upon it. He puts up £1000 of cash as
his capital in the venture, borrows £000 from the bank, and pays £1200 cash for the
property. The Journal entries would be as follows:—

(»)
In ordei to distinguish the two entries necessary to record any one of the above
transactions, as previously explained, the account which receives is called the Debtor,
and the account which gives is called the Creditor. Thus, Harrow pays £1000 into his
farms Cash Account; Cash Account is a debtor to Harrow (or Harrow’s capital account)
tor £1000. It is Journalised as in entry 1. Then £600 is borrowed from the bank;
Cash is again a debtor, this time to the bank, for £600, Journalised as in entry 2.
When the land is paid for, Cash gives £1200; Land Account is thus a debtor to Cash
tor £1“00, as shown in entry J. In the Journal entries above, for the sake of simplicity,
dates arc left out. The explanations under each entry are called “narrations.” They
help to make the Journal more useful for reference purposes. The debit entry, incidentally
is always put first.
The Journal entries must now be posted to the Ledger. Here are the Ledger
entries: —

BALANCING.—At the end of a month, or at the end of a full financial term
(usually a year), the two sides of each account in the Ledger must be added up and
the balances brought down. The way to do this is to add up each side, write the totals
m pencil, deduct the smaller total from the greater, and enter in ink the excess
(balance) under the last entry on the side with the smaller total. Here is an example
of a Ledger account, showing the balance:—
Dr. II. ERROL. Cr.

I _____ 1301 ” II 8 2 6
£112 18 4 £112 18 4
Feb. | 1 | By Balance | 11 ”£70 1 8
In the foregoing example the credit entries total £112 18s. 4d„ and the debits before
writing in the balance, total £42 16s. 8d. Thus there is an excess (or balance)
amounting to £70 Is. 8d. of credit entries over debits. This balance is entered under

A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN’S GREAT
RETURNS.
“Yeoman”: Mr. F. Coleman, of Tuela,
Saddleworth (S.A.), is a wheatgrower whose
methods and results are worth Common-
wealth-wide attention. For the 1929-30 sea-
son he reaped 5310 bags from 350 acres of
wheat, averaging about 46 bushels on a sea-
sonal rainfall (May 1 to October 31) of
12.11 inches. The average for the district
would be but little more than one-tliird of that.
During the last three years Mr. Coleman
has averaged 44J bushels per acre from Free
Gallipoli, while for the last four seasons
Wannon has yielded an average of 42i
bushels. He reaped 52 bushels 261 b. per acre
from Rajah, but his record return was 53
bushels 191 b. per acre (exclusive of the
w T eiglit of the bags) from 90 acres of Wannon
this season—equivalent to 4.4 bushels per
acre for every inch of seasonal rainfall. That
is 30 per cent, more than the optimum yield
per inch of seasonal rain worked out by
Prof. A. E. V. Richardson when ascertaining
the transpiration and water requirements of
a crop. It is, moreover, nearly four times
as much as the average State yield on the
basis of the seasonal rainfall.
The history of that 90-acre paddock is:
1924, wheat; 1925, fallow; 1926, wheat;
1927, oats; 1928, fallow; 1929, the wdieat
crop under review. The paddock was part-
disced to a depth of 3in. in March, 1928,
the balance being ploughed in July. It
was scarified July 20 to 30; harrowed in
August; scarified Sept. 15 to Sept. 20; har-
rowed Oct. 1 to Oct. 3; scarified Oct. 15 to
Oct. 20; scarified May 24 to May 31, 1929. It
was seeded with a rigid-tine combine, drill-
harrows attached, June 5 to June 26; 801 b.
of graded seed and 1681 b. of 48 p.c. super,
were sown per acre. The seed was dry-
pickled with copper carbonate dust. No
cultivation was given after seeding. The
total rainfall from July 1. 1928, to Oct. 31,
1929, was 21.85 inches. Thus the most was
made of rain falling.
Mr. Coleman attributes his good yields
to carrying out approved tillage practices at
the right time instead of at any time. In
the last three years he has won the State
championship for the best crop, and was
second twice. He thinks Gallipoli will be
more popular than Wannon in replacing
Federation, because the latter is subject un-
der adverse conditions to red rust and flag
smut, and is inclined to break off in front
of the stripper comb.
FACTS ABOUT AUSTRALIAN WHEAT.
“C. E. Real”: Australian wheat has a
great name abroad. It is described by an
eminent authority as “a very fine soft white
wheat of choice color and bloom, much
sought after for use in blending with strong
wheats.’’ Hard Duluth, an American wheat,
is described by the same authority as the
world’s premier and strongest wheat, with
Manitoba pushing it closely.
Other things being equal, a hard wheat
commands a higher price than a soft wheat,
because hard wheats produce a greater per-
centage of flour. Hard wheat with a bushel
weight of 581 b. will give the miller 70.8 per
cent, of flour; a soft white wheat with a
similar bushel weight gives 69.7 per cent.
When the bushel weight reaches 621 b., the
flour figures are 73.5 per cent, and 70.3 per
cent, respectively. Millers estimate a de-
crease of .75 per cent, of flour for every
pound decrease in the bushel weight. The
higher the bushel weight, the better for tbe
farmer, the miller and Australia.
It can be safely assumed that the best of
Australian wheat is exported, and the same
applies to flour. It follows that the average
grade of wheat milled in Australia is below
f.a.q. standard.
Fallowing pays _in ways other than
increased yield. Dirty land produces dirty
wheat, and the -weed-seeds, should they
escape the cleaning process at the mill (and
some of the finer seeds may), will affect the
quality and color of the flour. Some seeds
are known to give a distinct odor to flour;
the price of the wheat suffers in consequence.
Again, weed-seeds extracted by the cleaning
machine are subsequently ground and sold
as mill offal, and as weed-seeds are prone to
contain poisonous compounds the health of
farmer’s stock may be affected.
Smut is a nuisance'to farmer and miller
alike. To the miller it presents a special
problem in cleaning, for not a trace must
be permitted to enter the mill to depreciate
the value of the flour from the good wheats
to follow; consequently smutted grain is
marked dow T n in price.
These are some of the reasons why good,
sound grain should be produced; but the end
is not yet. Get it under cover, or cart it
to the stacks as soon as possible. Partly
germinated grain means an appreciable loss
in weight to the farmer and a lower-strength
flour to the miller, which means a few pence
per bushel off the wheat.
FARMERS’ FLOCKS.
“The Bat”: The class of sheep kept by
farmers is far from satisfactory, generally
speaking. Flocks have improved throughout
the _ Commonwealth as regards size and
quality of sheep and weight and quality
of fleece, but much of the credit is
due to the efforts of the big flockmasters.
The mixed flock so prevalent on small farms
is an eyesore.
Wool should be the first consideration, and
the importance of judicious culling to bring
about a good even type of sheep cannot be
overstressed. ' Breeding from any old ewe
capable of bearing a lamb is a great mis-
take. Culls should be fattened up—never
allowed to go to the ram.
The foundation of a successful flock de-
pends mainly on the type of ewes. A good
type does not cat any more grass than a
nondescript. Good sheep are always sale-
able ; nobody wants rubbish.
Two points must be borne in mind —first,
quality, density and length of staple; second,
size of sheep.
An idea of what culling can do may b >
instanced from the experience of two neigh-
bors in south-west Queensland. In 191 S
6000 station ewes were bought, and each
took an even run of 3000. Their holdings
were practically the same in area and carry-
ing capacity. One put his ewes to the
rams, without bothering to cull any; the
other drafted out a fair percentage, and
either killed them himself or fattened up
for the market. In nine years, although
each had about the same number of sheep,
and had been using practically the same class
of rams, the difference in clips was very
marked. The one who had culled and paid
attention to his breeding got a bigger price
per lb. for his wool and cut a lot more bales
per thousand sheep.
Small farmers protest that they haven’t
the time to draft their culls. But there is
very little time wasted at shearing, and it
does not take long to raddle a few old culls
and keep them out from the breeders.
In years to come the onus of keeping up
the high sheep and wool standard of Aus-
tralia will fall on the small farmers. Let
them aim now at a better and more uniform
class of sheep.
CACTOBLASTIS AND PEAR.
“C.11.P.”: “Oolino” (B. 22/l/’3O) says
my system of turning cows out into pear is
not dairying, but cruelty. He declares there
is no nourishment in pear.
We were once left with a lot of pigs on
hand after a clearing sale, and the price of
pollard was prohibitive. We filled a 40gal.
copper with pear leaves, added a little water
and boiled it. When it was well boiling we
added two. 71b. syrup tins of common
molasses. The jelly-like mass was rushed by
the pigs, and a bag of corn topped them off
for the bacon factory.
As for months being lost while the cows
are in the pear, it is better to lose a few
months’ profits than lose the bows and have
to replace them at the high prices that pre-
vail after a drought. There are cows here
that leave herbage to go to the pear, and
most of them are in the pink of condition.
I do not disparage what the cacto. has done
for pear-selection holders; but unless selec-
tors change their methods they are going
to have a thin time when the pear has been
cleaned up.
SUB. CLOVER AGAIN.
“Hillside” : Get the best out of your sub.
clover this autumn. Take out your discs or
spring-tooth cultivator and work up part of
your sub. paddocks to a fine tilth about three
inches in depth—sow at least a hundred-
weight of super, per acre on it; the early
autumn rains will do the rest.
I have seen sub. clover treated this way
give a carrying capacity equal to Algerian
oats at its best, and tins without the extra
cost of ploughing and seeding. Farmers who
practise this method in Gippsland and the
Western Districts (Vic.) usually have good
feed within three to four weeks after the
first rains, and on a lighter fall than is
required to bring on oats or barley.
Besides being cheaper this method of
getting early feed builds up your land, and
winter is not so injurious as on a crop
paddock.
HOW THE DANES DO THINGS.
“Traveller”: A recent reference in the
“Land” column to Danish eggs prompts this
dissertation on the way they do things in
Denmark. Every Danish egg is stamped with
grower’s name and date. But I am more
interested in dairying than poultry farming.
I was in Denmark last year. When in
Aarhus I asked a friend if he could take
me out to see a dairy, and he arranged a
most interesting visit. The shed, I found,
had big glass windows on either side. There
were 24 cows in the well-lighted building—
fine large animals, all dark brown, two in
each stall. There was a 2ft. thickness of
meadow hay for bedding. Alongside the
manger was an iron trough carrying
running water, which was turned on at
regular intervals during the day. Over each
stall was the daily tally of milk. When this
tally fell below a certain quantity the cow
was turned out and another brought in.
My friend read out some of the Govern-
ment regulations. One of them said: “After

Water Systems
IN its importance to life, water is second only
to air; without it existence is impossible,
and where it is scarce or impure—there
disease finds its chief ally.
The Delco-Light pressure water system has been
designed for the service of dwellers beyond the
reach of communal water supplies. Wherever
current is available, it provides an abundance
of refreshing, cool water at the turn of a tap —
always available—always direct from the source
of supply—-and at a pressure equal to any city
service.
A modern bathroom and sanitary system are
made possible and the drudgery of washing day
disappears. Away from
the house, the same
Delco-Light water sys-
tem supplies you with
water for stock, for the
dairy, the garden
and the garage.
It is easily in-
stalled, occupies
very little space,
is inexpensive to
purchase and to
run, and, best of
all, requires prac-
tically no atten-
tion.

Only one real reason ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
The consumption of
Sulphate of Ammonia
in Australia increased by approximately 35
per cent, during 1929, and for this there is
only one logical reason. Past experience had
proved its effectiveness on practically all crops.
Its use was definitely identified with increased
yields, which were in turn expressed in terms
of cold, hard cash. In a few words, SULPHATE
of Ammonia “paid.”
With the developments taking place in the
improvement of Australian pastures through
the application of nitrogenous fertilisers, a
further substantial increase in consumption
is anticipated during 1930.

carried out. ’ When my remark was trans-
lated to tlic ; owner he bubbled with in-
dignation. i apologised.
The building had a 'cement pathway about
14ft. wide between the cows. I stroked some
of the beasts,’ and on remarking liow clean
they were was informed that they were
washed every morning, and groomed, and also
groomed at night. One could have eaten
one’s dinner in the shed, everything was so
sweet and clean.
When leaving Denmark for England 1
travelled on a 11000-toii steamer which was
fully loaded with butter,, eggs and bacon;
cargo for which there was no room had to
be left on the wharf. Opposite where 1
stayed at Kensington was a big shop which
dealt solely in these commodities. I inquired
of the manager where a particularly fine
stack of sides of bacon had come from ; it
was about 10ft. high, and every side seemed
to be exactly matched as to size. “1 rom
Denmark,” I was told. “We stock Danish
only.” The reason? Well, sellers of bacon
wanted a side weighing 581 b. or near it, for
that size suited them in cutting out the
rashers. The Danes attended to this detail,
grading their pigs as an orcliardist grades
his apples. English bacon cos., on the other
hand., supplied sides weighing anything from
501 b. to 1001 b. The Danes think of every-
thing !
PREPARING BEESWAX FOR' MARKET.
“Larrapinta” : Cappings from combs pro-
vide the lightest, softest wax ; that rendered
from old combs is harder and of a deeper
color. The two should never be mixed. \\ ax
from old combs should be marketed as second-
grade. ~
To get a good clean sample put the cap-
pings into a tank, cover with water, and
leave to soak for at least 24 hours. I he
water is tlieji drained aw ay, the cappings
are placed in the boiler, covered with clean
water, and a slow lire is lit beneath it. Inc
wax must not be allowed to boil. When it is
all melted a screen made of clean pine, 1-
inches square by three inches deep, with line
gauze on the bottom, is floated in the hot
wax, which is then ladled out from inside
this screen and poured into clean petrol-tins,
each having about an inch of boiling water in
the bottom. These filled tins are set aside to
cool, the rest of the stuff on top of the
tank is put into a clean cornsacK, placed
under a press, and 'the remaining wax
pressed out. . , , ,
When the wax in the tins has set, the
blocks' are slipped out, their bottom ends
scraped clean and put back into the boiler
which must be clean —covered with water,
and the process of melting and boiling is
repeated. When it is cold, write on the top
of each block with a nail-point your name,
address and “first-grade,” wrap separately in
newspaper, put into cases and send oft to
market.
T 0 treat old combs, melt up as the cap-
pings were done, but a screw-press is neces-
sary to get out the wax which remains m
the cocoons. This wax should be also
remelted, and marked second-grade.
A practice which is to be strongly con-
demned is the putting of a smalt quantity of
sulphuric acid into the water in which the
wax is melted. This lazy-man’s way cer-
tainly produces a nice pale , sample, but
manufacturing chemists can detect acid-
treated wax at a glance —and don t buy _ it.
For years I used every care in preparing
and marketing my wax, and had the morti-
fication of seeing badly prepared, dark wax,
speckled with impurities, bring the same
price as my clean stuff. Four years ago,
however, a firm wrote to me stating that it
always bought my wax, and offering to take
my total output in future at a penny a
pound above the ruling market rate. As I
average 7001 b. of wax yearly, that extra
money is worth the trouble of getting up a
good sample.
THAT SPRAY PUMP.
“Disc Harrow” : The renewal of hoses is
one of the biggest items in the _ upkeep _ of
tne spray pump, but a little care in handling
may mean another season’s life. The wear
is hardest where the hose scrapes the edge
of the pump, and where it meets the spray
rod. The first is best protected by wrappings
of old bag, to be renewed as they wear
through. In the second a whipping of wire
will give best results. Baling wire as used
for straw is the most suitable.
Commence on the rod itself and work back
along the hose for eight inches, gradually
increasing the distance between turns. The
hose will then follow a gradual curve and
never be bent at a sharp angle. Do not
spray with both hands on the rod, but with
one on the rod and the other on the hose
below the point of junction. If the ground
is rough don’t try to uproot lumps of dirt
with the hose. A moment to lift it over
the obstruction is well spent.
A HAY SLEDGE.
“C.H.P.”: Sometimes it is desired to take
hay a short distance only, and a lot of time
is lost harnessing horses to waggons and
loading and unloading. Yet a hay sledge can
be easily made on the farm.
Get two good saplings about 12ft. long,
slightly bent at the end if possible to avoid
digging into the ground when hauled along.
Taper them to a point at the rear end. Nail
two crosspieces about three feet long at the
front of the saplings, and bore two holes
in one of the’ crosspieces about two feet
apart. Put two stout ropes about 15ft.
long through these holes, fasten a swingle-
bar to one end of the ropes, and have an
iron ring big; enough to fit over the
sharpened saplings at the other end-of each
rope.
When you need to move hay, put the sharp
ends of the saplings under it, bring the
ropes over the top of the load and slip each
ring over the end of a sapling. When the
horse pulls, he pulls the ropes through the
holes and so holds the load on the-sledge
without further tying.
SULTANA-DRYING.
“Caustic”: One of the most important
points in connection with the drying of sul-
tanas is the condition of the fruit prior to
its immersion in the dipping solution It
should be put into the picking .tins without
splitting or damaging the berries. A com
mon fault is to overfill the tin. ;
Tins should not be left in the boiling sun,
but placed under the shade of the vines.
Then all fruit should be taken, to the dip
as soon as possible after picking. Moie-
over, cultivate all the watering furrows out
of the headlands—this saves unnecessary
bumping when carting. It is necessary to
exercise further care when spreading tne
bunches on the racks; harsh treatment at
this juncture may spoil good work done
beforehand. „ ,
Mr. Lyon, one of the N.S.W, research offi-
cers, mentioned in a lecture recently that
if he were allocating points for production
ot good colored sultanas he would give oO
p.c. for condition of the fruit just prior
to immersion.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Would a selector intending to take up
sugar-beet growing in the Majfra district
(Vic.) have to contend with many pests and
diseases? —5199. , .
The only serious trouble met thus far
has been occasional damage to the young
beets by cutworms and tomato weevils, but
if taken in time these can be checked by the
use of Paris green or arsenate of lead.
Nematodes, beet blight, rust, root rot, etc.,
have not yet occasioned any difficulty, and
by rotation and careful cultivation growers)
should endeavor to avoid such troubles.
Rabbits are partial to young beets, but can
be easily controlled.
Do ticks breed on fowls, and do they infest
the roosts? —sl93.
Ticks do not breed on the fowls, but in
crevices of the houses, etc. If they are
present in any buildings to which the fowls
have access, they are likely to get on the
birds, even though they cannot get on the
roosts. Leaflet can be obtained from the
Department of Agriculture, Sydney, gratis.
One of my citrus trees has been attacked
by a pink fungus that grows on the bark of
twigs and branches. The fungus is at first
smooth, but later becomes cracked and a
dirty grey in color. Sonic gumming is also i
present. The bark is killed and the leaves
wilt. What’s wrong? The remedy? —4973. ,
It is attacked by the “pink disease” fungus |
—Corticium salmonicolor. All badly diseased
wood should be removed and burnt, and the
tree sprayed with Bordeaux mixture, 6-4-100,
plus 1 per cent, red spraying oil. Applica-
tions should be made periodically, preferably
in the rainy season, until the disease is
brought under control. It is not advisable
to apply the spray during droughty condi-
tions. The red oil should be thoroughly
emulsified in an equal quantity of water.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Brady’s Lookout”: While waiting for
someone to invent a handy (and inexpen-
sive) sub.-clover seed-separator, I use a
rough substitute. Try the hand chaff-cutter,
two blades, while the seed-burr is still
attached to the straw. I have just put
through and sowed enough off a small patch
for twenty acres. Bag into chaff-bags and
sow by hand; and keep blades sharp.
“Bill R.” : Where the ground is reasonably
good paspalum can be made to overcome
bracken patches. Mow off and burn the
bracken, then scarify the area and sow pas-
palum. Keep the bracken shoots cut back
until the grass has had a chance to root.
After that the ferns will be smothered.
“Korumburra”: A large packing case with
one board removed will, if placed in the
pen or near the sow, save the piglets. They
soon learn to sleep in it, away from the
sow, and so are not crushed when she lies
down. A little soft straw’ should be put in
the case.
“Mounier” : When young stinkwort plants
are showing to a height of about three inches,
turn a mob of wethers into the infested area.
A great percentage of the wort wall be eaten,
and the rest trampled and broken off.
“O”: If the point of a nail is “burred” by
a few light taps with the hammer, it can be
driven through any w’ood without danger of
splitting. This has the effect of making the
nail cut a passage for itself instead of acting
as a wedge.
“Disc Harrow”: When you have a large
number of shooks to knock up into cases, get
an old table, and nail one-incli cleats on it
to form slots at the proper distance apart.
These will hold the sides for you and save
hours in a day. In making flat cases, of
course, three such slots are required.
“Fodgie”: When planting tomatoes, scoop
out a fair-sized hollow and set the plant in
the middle. The bush will spread over the
' sides, and the fruit will lie cool and sheltered.
You will lose scarcely any fruit from sun-
burn in this way.
“Toggle”: When flies are bad, don’t forget
a fly-veil for your horse. For one thing,
it will save a lot of rubbed and torn harness.
“Bundy”: For cuts and bruises on horses
or cattle, wash affected parts with warm
water to which half a cup of safonia or
carbolacene has been added ; when they are
clean, dress with a mixture of two parts
olive (or salad) oil to one of carbolic acid.
Repeat daily. The oil and carbolic acid
mixture is also good for sore backs and
shoulders.
“Wrasli”: Warts on a cowl’s udder or
teats are best treated when the animal is
dry. Rubbing them with the juice of a
lemon will generally do the trick; if it fails,
dissolve a dessertspoon of washing soda in
a cup of water, and apply three times a
a “Sea Speck” : There is nothing better for
introducing powder into an animal’s eye than
a small insect-powder blower. And for apply-
ing liquids to wounds difficult of access an
ordinary sewing-machine oil-can with a long
straight dropper can’t be beaten. But, of
course, the vessels should be kept for these
purposes alone.
“Mounier”: When peas are winnowed by
hand, an effective winnower can be made
out of a sheet of flat galvanised-iron about
sft. by 3ft. In this, punch holes about
apart by fin. in diameter. Mount on a
wooden frame 4ft. high, with three sides v 4in.
above the surface of the tin. Leave one end
open. Fasten a piece of hessian underneath
the tin to catch the peas.

OUR DRAMATIC CRITIC GOES TO
CHURCH.
Lovers of comedy will find little to in-
trigue them in this show. Nor will bath-
room tenors take home any theme-songs
worth warbling. On the other hand, those
who like a moral with their theatrical fare
are provided for, full measure and brimming
over, and there is a gratifying absence of the
sex motif.
Arriving a little late we could find no
programme sellers, and are in consequence
unable to particularise the principals. An
old lady in an adjoining stall, whom we
ventured to interrogate on the subject, would
vouchsafe no more than a whispered Ush!”
As against this disability, the management
provided a book of the words free of
charge—a courtesy
which might well
be imitated in cer-
tain rival places of
entertainment.
The opening
chorus lacked
catcliiness, with the
result that most
members of the
audience ignored
the leading man’s
efforts to get them
to join in. The
dialogue that fol-
lowed was not
notable for wit and
there was a sad
lack of originality
in the leading
man’s patter. It is
deficient in humor
and needs pruning.
One of this per-
former’s mono-
logues lasted over
an hour and sent
many pleasure-
seekers to sleep.
The artist i n
question has a good
delivery but he
allows a neighing
note to creep into
his voice, and his
habit of shutting
liis eyes at inter-
vals, as though the
sight of the audi-
ence revolted him,
is unpleasing.
The chorus is
small half a
dozen chorines and
the same number
of lads—and totally
lacking in sex-
appeal. The fact
that no less than
five of its members
wore glasses mili-
tated against the
success of the
show. Glasses were
also worn by
several of the floor-captains while collecting
the admission-money during one of the so-
called song hits.
The bill does not appear to have a chance
to see the week out.

To James Watt a Scottish

Do you just take your oil
for a ride because you
hare to —or do you give
the matter of lubrication
really serious considera-
tion? If you knew more
about motor oils you
would not make your
choice lightly.
Atlantic gives your Engine
a real working partner!
When you buy a quart of Atlantic you are
buying a quart of perfect lubrication. You are
not buying any low-melting, oil-thinning, waxy
impurities. Such impurities (which are
not removed by ordinary refining pro-
cesses) are entirely eliminated from
Atlantic by a special and extra whirling
process. And that isn’t all!
A second Atlantic process "tempers” or
toughens the oil, rendering it the most
durable engine lubricant known. The result
is that Atlantic remains unaltered in spite of
heat, pressure and friction. Nothing
can alter its basic character. It never
breaks down. If it weren’t for ordinary
road-dirt and petrol contamination,
Atlantic would keep on lubricating
your car for a year on end! It is
always on its "metal.”

edienne. Everything she does in ‘Dear Love’
is done perfectly.”
“F.S.”: Plaving seen both the stage and
talkie versions of “The Trial of Mary
Dugan,” I should say honors are about
even, The stage play kept the theme more
continuously before you. It was like a
snapshot of life taken by a camera with a
wide-angle lens. The screen play takes pot-
shots at the plot through a telescope. The
potshots are linked together, however, with
great ingenuity, and the eye tends to flag
before the interest. The picture lasts nearly
two. hours, Which, omiitting intervals, is
about the length of the stage version; yet
there is no slackening of interest. Which
shows that, under intelligent direction and
minus the execrable elocution which has
been a feature of most talkies, the vocal
movie can handle a complicated drama
adequately, and that suggests there will
eventually be a sorting out of picture
theatres. “The Trial” makes demands on
the attention which some theatregoers are
not prepared to grant it. They will drift
to the theatres which tend to cater for their
requirements. The people who call for
stronger food will be segregated in other
playhouses, possibly less ornate and of
smaller dimensions. At present everything
is jumbled together. You never know what
you are going to get. Roast beef and cream
trifle are served on the same menu.
“L.H.P.” : Cornelia Japikse, in her recently-
published book “The Dramas of Tennyson,”
writes of “Queen Mary” having “on the Aus-
tralian stage had two long runs, first at
the Melbourne Royal and later when re-
produced at the Byou [presumably Bijou]
in the same city.” This is news indeed!
Augusta Dargon, who introduced the drama
to Sydney at the Royal, got only 11 nights
out of it. Alice Deorwyn, still in Sydney,
was Lady Clarence, and sister Connie, also
still here, was Alice in this undramatic
play, which at the London Lyceum, under
old Bateman, with his two daughters, Walter
Bentley and Henry Irving in the cast,
lasted only a month.
“Craiser” : Instead of spending £60,000 in
a - referendum in order to discover whether
Victorians want prohibition, the State Gov-
ernment ought to send a representative to
watch the audience at “The School for Scan-
dal.” The unanimous and whole-hearted
applause which greets Sir Oliver Teazle’s
decision to leave his fortune to the hard-
drinking but generous-hearted Charles Sur-
face rather than to the wowseristic Joseph
would give him all the information needed.
“L.H.P.”: A strange yarn attaches to the
English provincial rights of “The Belle of
New York.” A scratch production at Mar-
gate, an uncomfortable hotel, a bad dinner
and an unappreciative audience impressed
Morton, the librettist, and Lederer, manager
of the New York Casino, with an intense
desire to be quit of it. They snapped at an
offer of £2OOO for their interest. At a later
stock-taking it proved that the provincial
rights had yielded the Geo. Musgrove estate
£87,000, and “The Belle” is still a valuable
property! Most of the characters in the
opera had their prototypes in mummers on
the American boards. Cora was Lilian Rus-
sell, Snifkins was De Wolf Hopper, Fifi was
Anna Held, and Mugg was Chevalier’s
“Fallen Star.” The Bronsons were sup-
posed to be the Rockefellers, father and son,
Blinky Bill was Ivid McCoy, the then
pugilistic idol, and Violet Gray was a stage
version of General Booth’s daughter.
“C. 8.”: Alex. Symons, an Adelaide play-
wright whose works have been performed by
the Repertory Society, has caught the profes-
sional eye. Leon Gordon read two of his plays
and was enthusiastic about “Sigismund,” and
so he should be, since it is approximately
five times as well written and as dramatic
as Gordon’s own “The Poppy God.” As the
discovery was made too late for the piece
to be included in Gordon’s season, the actor
is taking the MS. to Hollywood to try to
get it talkied.
“M.G.S.” : As a producer in a small way
of works of the imagination, I am offensively
amused at the squealing of Australian theatre
proprietors because the American film pro-
ducers are charging as much as 30 p.c.
royalties for their pictures. Thirty per cent,
is certainly more than any poet or novelist
gets, but if other artists movie-makers
are sometimes artists —are able to squeeze
more out of the middlemen who batten on
them, well, good luck to them, I say. What
have the movie heads of the Commonwealth
done to art but degrade it and make fortunes
out of its degradation? If it hurts them
to cough up 30 p.c. of their profits to
Americans, let them try to break the Yankee
monopoly by fostering an Australian film
industry. The Australian artist is so used
to a measly five per cent, or less m royalties
that lie ought to be an easy mark for them.
“Dr. Trickell”: Here are the real names
of a few screen artists: Richard Arlen is
Richard Van Mattimore; Gwen Lee is
Gwendoline Le Pinski; Lupe Velez is Guada-
lupe Villalobos; Paul Muni is Muni Weisen-
freund; Ramon Novarro is Ramon feaman-
eigos; Barry Norton is Alfreda Biraben;
Gilbert Roland is Luis Antonio Damoso de
Alonzo; Renee Adoree is Jeanne de-la lonte
—she toured the Tivs.; Joan Crawford is
Lucille Le Seuer; Dolores Del Rio is Lolita
Dolores Asunsolo de Martinez; A 1 Jolson
is Asa Yoelsen ; Antonio Moreno is Garrido
Antonio Monteaguido Moreno; and Karl
Dane is Rasmus Karl Thekelson Gottlieb.
All are prominent American players.
“Alfred O’Toole”: The lions have been
roaring in London over the Musical Copy-
right Bill, which seeks to squash the traf-
ficker in copyrights of musical compositions,
but unfortunately would include the com-
poser in the same fate. Bernard Shaw roared
that the Labor members responsible for the
bill were sweating the musical composer. The
Incorporated Society of Authors, Playwrights
and Composers officially sooled Shaw on. A.
A. Milne and others heaped ridicule on the
bill, and composers and their friends forced
the formation of a select committee to inves-
tigate. The Faculty of Arts, Society of
British Singers, Incorporated Soci ty of
Musicians, and Performing Rights Society
all joined the others to make one concerted
roar of it. Shaw suggested that the Master
of the King’s Musick should use his influence
at Court to get the King’s veto if the Com-
mons does not throw the bill out. Anything
written before the Act comes into force is
excluded.
“L.IT.P.” : Curiously, “The Belle of New
York” has never been a success in Now
York. It ran only six weeks on the first
production at the Casino, though when on
tour the money simply poured in. George
Musgrove saw it at Philadelphia, and took
practically the entire American cast and
chorus to London Shaftesbury, where he
registered a run of 697 performances and
cleared thousands.
The Inky Way
A dinkurn Australian periodical is the
“Kristarinja Wolambarinjaka Pepa,” pub-
lished monthly at Hermannsburg, Central
Australia, SO miles west of Stuart. The
editor is F. W. Albrecht, Lutheran mission-
ary, and the language is Arunfca. Visitors
to Hermannsburg are so rare that every one
has_ a large par. stating the nature of his
business, his impressions of Central Aus-
tralia, and, most important of all, his pro-
mise to send back a tin of lollies. Scholars
of the mission and peripatetic tribes spread
over hundreds of miles read the seven or eight
sheets of close type.
“A.R.8.”: The Bulletin will be sorry to
hear of the death of Irwin A. Ormsby, a
frequent contributor of verse over the pen-
name. “Zadig” in the late ’nineties. By
the time he was 20 the inspiration of his
teens seemed to desert him, but he still
remained a well-known figure among The
Bulletin coterie. Ormsby’s was, I think,
the most encyclopaedic mind I have
ever known. He had much more than a
smattering of nearly all subjects. I have
heard him talk with lepidopterists, giving
butterflies their scientific names, and have
seen him assist them where their own know-
ledge ended by naming the plant or tree
upon which a butterfly was feeding.
Gilbert Mant, perpetrator of sundi-y
“Woman’s Mirror” serials, Bulletin verse,
stories and pars and heaps of other stuff,
heads for the Great Fog. He got a good
grounding in Australian life as it is lived in
the bush before taking a job on the old
Sydney “Telegraph,” and he goes to London
with a novel or two under his arm.
Even O. Henry’s newspaper, which came
out once a fortnight or “as often as it
could,” is knocked into a cocked hat by “The
Inlander,” the Presbyterian out-back jour-
nal, whose reverend editor bears the name
of John Flynn. No. 20, the current issue,
is the first to appear for three years. Some-
thing like high-water mark was reached in
1913, the year after the Inland Mission was
established, when three numbers were issued.
Since then it has appeared at odd times;
the recent break is a record. The present
number holds an interesting article on the
Burke and Wills country and one even more
interesting on the mission’s aerial medical
service, which has done great work in the
Queensland Outback.
“lan C.”: After 28 years as “Argus” re-
porter, chief of staff, special writer and then
chief leader-writer, Billy Brennan has gone
for a trip to the Cold Laud. He is the
third member of his family to serve the Con
servative sheet. His brother T.C., now a
K.C., was a sub-editor 25 years ago, and
Harry, another brother, is a senior reporter.
They and the Federal Attorney-General and
i lawyer-sister are all children of a shir,
lerk and engineer, whose friendship witl:
T. G. Edwards, of the Bendigo “Indepen
dent,” was responsible for the family’s intro
Auction to newspaper offices.
“Daru”: One finds The Bulletin ii
unexpected places.. Picking up a leading
American Sales Magazine to-day I find one
and a half pages, including a poem, pirated
from The Bulletin, without acknowledg-
ment. A few weeks back a Chilian paper
found three columns interesting enough to
steal. And as for drawings, the appropia-
tion of Bulletin picture-humor has become
one of the minor U.S. industries.
“S.T.S.”: Adelaide City Council has
asserted itself as censor of newspaper posters.
Not a bad idea in some cases; but the one
banned was the “Register’s” simple “ ‘All
Quiet’ —Greatest War Story ever Published
—Starts To-day.” The reason given by the
inspector-censor was that it was not “news
of the day.” The next morning’s “Citv
Council Turns Censor: Bans Bill on. ‘All
Quiet’ ” got through all right.
“S.T.S.”: Talking of long-distance runs
Till I went for an English holiday in 1927
there had not been for well over 30 years a
number of The Bulletin without something
of mine in it. For a non-stop and without-
holiday run, this might not be bad for. a
member of the office, staff;. for, a freelance:
operating at a distance of 1100 miles, it
should be a record.

“Kell”: Every year countless tins of
American corn are sold in Australia, though
this country grows thousands of acres of
maize equal to the world’s best. The importa-
tion sells for about Is. a tin. Most people like
green maize cooked on the cob, but when it
is purchaseable it is only at certain seasons
and places, whereas the tinned stuff finds a
sale everywhere and any time.
* * * *
“B. J.”: Although a telegraph-messenger
need not be possessed of the school-leaving
certificate (B. 19/2/’3O), it is not the fault
of the department if his education is cut
short when he enters the service. Postal
institutes, with competent instructors, are
available in all the States, and a lad can
study (either personally or by correspon-
dence) for higher positions. Many who are
now the heads of various sections entered
the service as telegraph-messengers at 13
or 14 years of age.
* * *
“Clydesider” : The war between the Sydney
tram and ’bus services is a reminder that a
similar feud has been raging in Glasgow,
where the trams are supposed to be the
best, run in the world. The civic authorities
have met the ’bus challenge by fitting the
municipal trams with upholstered seats and
I warming them electrically. Results were soon
apparent; from June to December last year,
passengers increased .by 15 millions, and
revenue by £88,129.
=i= * * *
“B-Gar”: Railway freights need revising
throughout Australia, and nowhere more
than in Queensland. A prominent pastoralist
recently approached the Commissioner with
an offer of £lOOO for the carriage of 10,000
| sheep from Peak Downs to Macalister, a
distance of some 700 miles, pointing out that
if the sheep weighed 350 tons, the price
would be about £2 17s. per ton. Seeing that
wheat is carried on the railways for about
Id. per ton per mile, and sugar at a shade
under Id. per ton, the offer seems reason-
able. The freight for scoured wool is about
lOd. per ton, so the grazier has good
reason to complain of differential treatment.
=:= * * *
“Noondoo”: Chairman W. D. Gibbs, of
the Australian Pastoral Co., told the annual
meeting in England that unless the high
cost of production in Australia came down
the co. would move on to South Africa or
the Argentine. He didn’t say how it was
going to dispose of its huge holdings in
N.S.W. and Queensland, especially the latter.
The properties range from the N.S.W. border
to the far central-west of Queensland. In
this respect the co. is like the chap who
took the bear by the ears; how to let go
is the problem.
=!= * *
“Barnacle Bill”: Returning to Australia
on an overseas steamer recently, I went to
purchase some canned fruits at the barber’s
shop, and found that the stuff had been
‘packed in Shanghai.” The barber explained
that there was no other line in stock; his
job was merely to sell what was provided
for him. And this was on a steamer trading
solely between England and Australia ! As
the overseas lines are snavelling about a
million and a half of Australian cash in
fares alone this season, to say nothing of
freight, surely it is up to them to use Aus-
tralian produce where possible.
* * * *
“Fernie”: When Lord Craigavon was in
M.L. he took an intense interest in Phor-
mium tenax, the stout native flax, and he
suggested that Ulster and the Dominion
should swap seeds and endeavor to acclima-
tise each other’s flax. The Irish linum,
which has a very fine fibre, has been culti-
vated in the Shivery Isles in the past, under
Government encouragement, as a source of
linseed, but results weren’t profitable, the
oil product being much lower than can be
obtained in the more suitable climate of
certain districts in India. But linum has
never been grown in the Dominion for fibre,
and phormium cultivation on a commercial
scale has never been attempted outside
Maoriland, so there seems to be room for
experiment.
* * *
Dear Bulletin —“Gabba” (B. 19/2/’3O)
records astonishment that the Greater Bris-
bane Council had wound up the year with
a credit balance of over £53,000, and won-
ders how much of the year’s expenditure had
been charged to Loan Account. May I point
out that the Brisbane City Council Debt
Redemption Trustees are a statutory body
independent of the elected council, and that
last year they received from the council for
redemption instalments on account of exist-
ing loans £203,074, and from interest on the
Trustees’ investments £48,072, and that at
the end of last year they held bonds, stocks,
debentures and cash —all trustee securities—•
to the sum of £1,046,962. From this you
may see that, even if some of the year’s dis-
bursements were on Loan Account, the coun-
cil is at least making some reasonable pro-
vision to meet maturing loans. —Yours, etc.,
F'. W. G. Annand, Town Clerk.
* * * *
“Avon”: A move that may help M.L.
farmers to bridge the occasional hiatus be-
tween the production-cost and selling-cost of
their wheat is the projected conversion of
wheat-straw into cardboard for butter-boxes.
The Dominion uses millions of feet of pine
timber every year for the boxing of dairy
produce, and the butter producers complain
that there’s always a risk of the timber
tainting the contents. That won’t apply to
strawboard, and the £1 a ton which will be
paid by the manufacturers to the wheat-
grower will represent an extra Bd. a bushel
on wheat —there’s an average of a ton of
straw to the acre, and wheat runs 30 bushels
to the acre. The 561 b. wooden butter-box
costs Is. lfd. and the strawboard article
works out at a decimal under 12d., so there’s
a worth-while margin to benefit two staple
industries.

The above cutting, “ Maryborough
Chronicle ” November 12th. 1929, is
from a speech made in Sydney on
October 23rd. at the Interstate Confer-
ence of CJhambers of Manufacturers by
Mr. S. A. Best, Senior Vice-President of
the Queensland Chamber.
Mr. Best has since stated that he referr-
ed to the cannery of Foggitt Jones Pty.
Ltd., packers of the thirty varieties of
Australian-wide known REX Pure
Foods.
Among these are the famous REX
Sandwich delicacies, including REX
Luncheon Cheese, REX Ham Pate,

ous REX-PYE, so handy and delicious
for lunch.
To be sure of obtaining this supreme
quality meat -in - jelly, always say
c.ts, so exports will not suffer.
I was recently privileged to see over
one of tlte largest of Australia’s canneries,
the cleanliness of which was remarkable.
But still more remarkable was the fact
that over 90 per cent, of the machinery
used was built in Australia. The cans
and glassware were locally made -near
the factory. All cases were made from
Australian timber, nailed with Australian
nails. Labels were printed in Australia
with Australian-made printing ink. In
fact, this one factory causes, by. its policy
of buying its requirements here, em-
ployment in almost every Stdte of
Australia—and of course helps many
other manufacturers.

EXTRACTS FROM PREFACE.
AVIATION FROM THE GROUND UP has been written, not for the technician,
the aeronautical engineer, or the seeker after technical detail, but for the average
every-day man who wants to learn the practical side of aviation. There is no
great mystery connected with airplane flight; it follows certain basic principles,
or laws, and it is the purpose of this book to explain’ these things in a very
elementary, way.

“TOO-OLD”
TIRED-OUT
HERE IS A SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE REMEDY
Too-old, tired-out men, complaining
of lack of vigor and vitality, you
will never be fit, well and happy until
you face facts. Your trouble in the
true sense is a blood trouble, starting
at the kidneys. The kidneys may be
said to rule the body’s health. When
the kidneys are failing to keep the
blood-stream pure, poisons and waste
matters accumulate. Thus, with an

JUST ONE FROM THOUSANDS
OF LETTERS OF GRATITUDE
Mr. Alfred Wall, 7 Walter Street,
Yarraville, Victoria, writes: ‘‘For six
weeks I lay on my back with rheuma-
tism, aching pains in my back, lum-
bago. I was told I could not be
benefited. A friend of mine told me
about De -Witt s Kidney* and Bladder
Pills and I started on them. I do
not regret it. I am now in - perfect
health. I have told several people of
the little De Witt s -bottle and of
my return to health.”
De Witt’s Pills is not a new craze-of-the-moment remedy. For 40 years
it has been bringing health, vigor and vitality to over-worked, tired-out men
and women. It is recognised as a splendidly beneficial remedy in cases of
Rheumatism, Chronic Backache, Sciatica, Lumbago, Bladder Weakness, and the
nervous troubles and pains that accompany excess of uric acid in the system.
The very young, the weakest and the oldest can take De Witts Kidney and
Bladder Pills. No dangerous drugs or purgatives, no heart-exciting chemicals,
but a scientific preparation that will do you good from the very first dose.
Get “De Witt’s” and get health and happiness. In 24 hours you will see
results. This is our guarantee.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, because of their wonderful popularity,
have been imitated. Other kidney pills there may be, but for your own
health’s sake and your pocket’s sake refuse all imitations.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Nadeau’s victory in the Australian Cup
made members of the MeShortodds fra-
ternity smile expansively. They had moaned
over the Oakleigh Plate and Newmarket
Handicap results, and flinched at the mere
utterance of the names of Amounis and Phar
Lap; but when Plarry Lewis’s little Adelaide
mare romped home in the long-distance
handicap they regained all their losses with
interest. Sir Kibble disappointed stable
plungers. Trouble encountered half a mile
from home does not adequately explain his
failure. Octember was also found wanting,
but he pulled up groggy. Nadean established
a new time record, for the race (3min.
50-Jsec.), and thoroughly deserved her win.
She did not race again at the meeting.
“Tich” Wilson, w T ho rode Nadean, won the
Geelong Cup next day on Taras, trained
at Flemington by J. G. Heywood. for a
Queensland sportsman. Wilson originally
was apprenticed to Hey wood’s brother,' but
the indentures were transferred to James
Scobie. Scobie considered he had first claim
on Wilson’s services, and a flare-up occurred
when the boy declined the Australian Cup
mount on Gleamlight because of a prior
engagement. Wilson has lost the lightweight
riding for “Pytchley Lodge,” but reckons
that the role of freelance will be more pro-
fitable, thoilgh, association with Scobie enabled
him to pilot two Melbourne Cup winners.
Theo. Lewis—unrelated to the venerable Bob
—temporarily occupies the vacated post.
Harry Telford was unperturbed by Phar
Lap’s first-up defeat in the St. George Stakes
at Caulfield on February 15. That gallop did
the champion three-year-old a world of good.
He ran away with the St. Leger and the
Governor’s Plate, travelling with equal kind-
ness for Jim Pike and the Victorian light-
weight, Elliott. How Phar Lap came to fight
so strenuously with Bob Lewis in the Mel-
bourne Cup is hard to understand. The fact
of riding him at work may have helped Elliott
to arrive at an understanding with Phar
Lap. Great though Amounis undoubtedly is,
Phar Lap will be a doughty antagonist if
they meet at a mile and a quarter, and a
trial of conclusions can hardly be avoided in
Sydney. The Easter tournament at Rand-
wick is fraught with big issues, Maoriland
being powerfully represented by Nightmarch
and Chide.
The greatest galloping treat witnessed at
Flemington was Phar Lap’s victory on Satur-
day in the King’s Plate. Of course, he could
not have failed to dispose of such mediocre
rivals as Mondiaga, Some Quality, Second
Wind and Lineage; but no one expected the
chestnut to set up a lead of 40 lengths and
score, pulling up, by half that distance.
Moreover, the time for two miles (3mm.
25sec.) was a quarter of a second faster
than Strephon’s time in the same event last
autumn. Phar Lap strode tirelessly, and
could have smashed Spearfelt’s Flemington
record (3min. 22fsec.) or the Australasian
figures of Star Stranger (Smin. 22isec.).
Those who backed him for the Melbourne
Cup were terribly unlucky.
Wallace Mitchell smote his. fellow book-
makers hip and thigh by backing the aptly-
named-Uriah Heep (Rossendale-Hundlity)
from 6 to 1 down to 7 to 2 for the Gibson
Carmichael Stakes. Uriah Heep had ‘only a
neck to spare at the finish, having tired
when challenged by Riaadoon. In the Autumn
Steeplechase, Nightlark found 2\ miles
rather beyond his tether, and was beaten by
both Seafit and Merauki. .Joe Cook landed
the Korthcote Handicap with Leadight (2 to
1), who,., finishing gamely on the rails,
accounted for Romany Rye by a mere head.

For Caulfield on Saturday :
St. Ivilda Cup: Standard Bearer; next,
Master Lunette.
South Yarra Handicap: Fission; next,
Du r ward.
ECONOMICS.
GOLFER (on strange links ): “What’s the'average tip round here, boy?”
CADDY: “Two bob.”
CADDY (after receiving 2s.): “Thanks, Mister. You're the first bloke Ive had to come
up to the average.”
Two horses with distinguished relatives
attracted a lot of attention at Canterbury
Park on Saturday. One was Salvador, a
two-year-old chestnut colt by Rivoli —Bob
Cherry, dam of Eurythmic. He is trained at
Warwick Farm by his owner, Ike Andrews,
and won there on February 15, showing such
dash that he was made a very short-priced
favorite for a division of the Juvenile -Handi-
cap at Canterbury. He figured in a great
finish, and was beaten a “short” head by
Floral Beauty (20 to 1), a daughter or
imported Cistercian, with Cronulla, the
second favorite, the same distance away.
There may be a future for Salvador over a
distance. Certainly, he is bred to stay.
The other connection of a turf celebrity
was Anambah, a half-brother (by Magpie)
to Beauford. It was a long time since he
had been seen with the colors up,’ but his
track wmrk. had been smart, and he had
good backing for the Flying Handicap, fours
being his closing price. With Bartle up he
was soon showing his heels to the field,
and, going at his ease, he ended up a length
or so in front of Bunkum, who did well
in the straight, with Dainty Mick and
Prince Verderer third and fourth respec-
tively. Anambah got over the six furlongs
in lmin. 13§see. - Though an aged horse,
he r , hasn’t, done much racing, and another
handicap or two should come liis way before
long if Cush can keep him fit.
Left a dozen lengths in the first division
of the High weight Handicap, Greenloch (5
to 2) made up her ground so smartly that
she was in the middle of the field when three
furlongs had been traversed at a fast clip—
the six took 1.14. Naturally, she couldn’t
come on, but she would have been a good
thing had she got away with the others.
Sweet Oration (9 to 2), a slippery pony
by Demosthenes —Sweet Land, won from two
outsiders, Pretty Betty and Head On.
Darby Munro, who was on Sweet Oration,
made it. a double by riding Happy New (3
to 1) to victory in the Canterbury Handicap.
Happy New, who is by Rosseiidale—Marco-
tina, fairly outstayed the others, of whom the
nearest to him were Aoraiigi (7 to 2) and
Bronze Fuze (3 to 1). He is only a four-
year-old, and it is doubtful’ whether the, best
has yet been seen of him.
Exact (7 to 1), a Shillinglee filly owned
and trained by J. A. Scully, had' an all-the-
way win in the Ashbury Handicap, though
Yainbaeoona (10 to 1) made a close thing
of it. Joy King (7 to 2), a gelding from
Maoriland, ran a peculiar race, finishing at
a great bat in third place after having been
a long last early, and the stewards decided
to ask some questions.
* * * *
For Moorefield on Saturday:—
Kogarah Stakes: Royal Brew; next, Eden
Yale.
St. Patrick’s Day Mile: Oave Dweller;
next, Anambah.
Moorefield Handicap: Happy New; next,

Oarlton Welter: Greenlocli; next, Prince

* * * *
The V.R.C. liandicapper reckoned Green-
line (lOst. 21b.) 41b. better than Amounis
over the straight six at Flemington. Amounis
did not start in the Newmarket; Greenline
won. Now the A.J.C. man considers
Amounis-(lOst! 51b.) 31b. better than Green-
line over the Doncaster mile. In the mean-
time, of course, Amounis beat Greenline
pointless in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes at
Flemington at w.f.a.; the Magpie geld-
ing carried 111), more than the New-
market winner. Nightmarch splits the pair
in the Doncaster; he gets lOst. 41b. Aussie,
whose form in Australia has only been
second-rate, is burdened with 9st. 71b. He
is a very badly treated horse. Pentheus
has Sst. 131 b. and Gay Ballerina Bst. 91b.
None of these attracts so much as some of the
lighter weights-—Lorason (Sst. 41b.), Haba-
shon (7st. 121 b.), Belle Gallante _(7st. 71b.),
First Arrow (7st. 71b.) and Poitiers (7st.
41b.).
For the Sydney Cup Nightmarcli has lOst.
31b., Amounis 9st. 121 b„ Chide 9st. 91b.,
Loquacious 9st. 61b. and Statesman 9st. 51b.
Phar Lap is not engaged; neither is the
Australian Cup winner, Nadean. Paddi - Eve
is good, but Sst. 91b. is a lump of weight
for so small a mare. Oratrix (Bst. 51b.) is
in better, and likely seven-stoners are Induce-
ment (7st. 131 b.), Some Quality (7st. 121 b.),
Tidal (7st. 121 b.), Romany Rye (7st. 41b.),
.Tolm Buchan * (7st. 31b;) and Royal Smile
(6st. 121 b.). Were this Page inclined to
speck a double it would take Lorason and
■ John Buchan.
Prices at the annual yearling _ sales in
Melbourne showed a distinct decline. On
the opening day 78 lots went through for
7155 guineas, or .an average of nearly 92
guineas as opposed to over 114 last year.
The best price was 400 guineas for a striking
brown colt by ’ Grcenstead from Tarana.
Some interest was aroused at the appearance
in the ring of Manfred’s first batch, a colt
out of New Shot being passed in at 900
guineas. He should not be long in finding a
buyer. On the second day 142 lots were
sold out of 166, the average being 152
guineas. They included a big batch from the
late Norman Falkiner’s Noorilim stud, from
which 11 Windbags brought an average of
212 guineas. Top price of the sales was
given for one of this Noorilim exhibit, a
brown colt by Spearhead (imp.) from
Beryllia (imp.) bringing. 1600 guineas. The
bidder was the Flemington trainer E. Fisher.
Another Grcenstead colt changed hands for
500 guineas, the Australian sire’s get being
in good demand at fair prices throughout the
sales.
* * * *
Though he had dropped out of the picture
somewhat of late years, the' late 'John Brown,
racing as “Mr. Baron,” cut a very consider-
able figure on the Australian turf in the
heyday of his career. For years he main-
tained a considerable stud in N.S.W. In
spite of his many successes he probably
dropped a lot of money over his racing and
breeding enterprises. Yet he had some out-
standing wins. Prince Fpote, the best horse
he ever raced, won him the A.J.C. and
V.R.C. Derby and- the Melbourne Cup of
1909, while other races to l “Mr. Baron's"
credit were a Sydney Cup, another Victorian
Derby, a dead-heat for the 1919 A.J.C.
Derby, a Metropolitan, an A.J.C. Produce
Stakes, a Doncaster, two V.R.C. St. Legers
and two A.J.C. St. Legers.-
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Australian middleweight-champion J ack
Haines (list. 2Mb.) and Ted Monson
(list, ljlb.) kept a big crowd wildly
excited at Sydney Stadium-' on Satur-
day night in their return bout. Haines
again ran out a winner on points
after 15 rounds of hard fighting, in which
Monson’s extraordinary toughness was a
feature. Neither lost time in getting to busi-
ness, and in the early rounds Monson wor-
ried Haines by persistent attacks at close
quarters, despite the champion’s terrific
punching. In the sixth and seventh Monson
was belted all over the ring, but came back
full of fight. In the eleventh, after receiving
another leathering, he forced the fighting to-
wards the end, and had Haines rattled. Over
the concluding rounds, Monson’s strength
began to wane under the punishment
received. In the last round Haines fought
all over his game opponent, who was down
twice for nine.
(Continued on page J/1.)
“Bash”: Some idea of the craze for the
American brand of football is seen in the
annual report of Notre Dame University, a
comparatively unimportant foundation in the
West. During the season the matches
drew 600,000 spectators. The average
price of admission was four dollars and
the total swag was 2,354,000 dollars —say,
£470,000. Yum, yuin. It’s enough to make
the Rugby 'and Victor inn Football Leagues
shed tears of agony at the thought of what
they are missing by not being domiciled in
America.

THE MODEL HUSBAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Manager Kelly said that one member of the
Australian cricket team had applied to the Board
of Control for special permission to take his wife'
with him. The board would not hear of it.”
Ladies whose lords perforce must cross the
ocean
To show their prowess upon English
swards, .*
Account them not deficient in devotion,
Keflect it isn’t of their own accords
Grass-widows you’ve become. It’s just a
notion,
Or rather an obsession of the board’s
That wives are best omitted from the ticket
If fellows want to whip the world at cricket.
A countervailing influence' that clashes
(However smart the frock or chic the hat) .
Is undesirable when leather flashes -
Swift to the pickets from the nimble bat.
Bethink, they’ve simply got to grab the
Ashes,
All else must take a second place to that—
A solemn truth that each should take a
note of ,
Wlio’d be the placens uxor Horace wrote of.
Whenever man has girded him for action
From the dim dawn of history, you’ll find,
However much to his dissatisfaction
He needs must leave a lot of things behind
(Always including his superior fraction)
As calculated to divert his mind
From the supreme importance that attaches
To whacking enemies or winning matches.
Yet one there was who viewed with desolation
The thought of being severed from his own.
Who sought to sway the board’s determina-
tion
But found it stern as Fate and hard as
stone.
And Kelly’s tact must merit admiration —-
To leave the model husband’s , name
unknown
Was real art. For since he hasn’t said it
Each Benedict may claim (and get) the
credit.

HOW \ HATE GETTING, VMET,
Ihe Ins ahd Outs
“Narque”: Nothing has so much aroused
the interest of the public in the departure
of the Australian cricketers as the news
that one of them had made most urgent;
application to the Board of Control for
permission to take his wife with him. That
flinty-hearted body refused point-blank, and
all are eagerly waiting developments. These
may take the form of an assault on the
board by some infuriated female with
an umbrella —there are a lot of people in
Australia, and especially in Collingwood, who
would cheer the lady on. On the other
hand, it is not beyond the bounds of pos-
sibility that the lady may stow away or ship
as cabin-boy in male attire, like the crew of
the “Hot Cross Bun” in the Bab Ballads.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: The dust of the departing
Australian Eleven had not died away before
news came to hand of a country cricketer
who seems predestined to become a member
of a Test side in Australia, at least. Play-
ing for Daroolbalgie, a hamlet somewhere in
the wilds of N.S.W., against the Forbes
Warriors, he batted for an hour and a half
before being dismissed without scoring. This
outstrips any previous record, even if we
include some of the batting feats in the Test
series between Chapman’s side and our own
Marathon performers.
* * * *
“New P.” : Gilligan’s Marylebone cricketers
ended a pleasant tour of Maoriland with a
game against Taranaki, which is more famous
for football and cows than for cricket. The
side has played good sporting cricket, and
has proved very popular in the Dominion, a
fact which has led to many comparisons with
its predecessor under Archie McLaren. The
personality of the respective captains had
much to do with this. McLaren’s Olympian
aloofness sat ill on a man who had for years
lived by cricket as adviser and manager to
the Lancashire XI and similar posts, and
it was resented. Gilligan’s only complaint
was about the umpires in the minor matches.
He says their views on l.b.w. are appalling.
It seems invidious to pick on the M.L.
umpires in this regard.
* * * *
“Ultima Thule”: It is a long worm that
has no turning. In Canberra the umpires
have been functioning all the season for
mere out-of-pocket expenses, and these are
continually being called in question, especially
in the matter of refreshment. So the other
day, at the opening of the semi-final matches,
the umpires’ association called out its men to
back a demand for higher pay. Under the very
noses of a Labor Ministry the cricket authori-
ties engaged the services of players from
teams which had failed to reach the semi-
final, and so locked out the members of the
umps.’ union.
* * * *
“Guilford”: The hard times are making
themselves felt in Westralian cricket circles
as elsewhere. The State cricket association
has regretfully decided that it cannot con-
tinue Arthur" Richardson’s engagement as
coach. For a couple of seasons past the ex-
South Australian has occupied the year with
a professional engagement in Lancashire
League cricket during the Australian winter,
returning to Perth for the next Australian
season. He is going back to Britain on the
same boat as the Australian Eleven, and
will now, presumably, have to look for a
winter job in Britain to keep him going
until spring brings cricket round again.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane”: The Marylebone C. C.
has steeled its heart (B. 5/3/’3O) and has
announced the name of the selectors who will
choose the English side for the coming tests.
One is our old friend J. C. White of Zummer-
set, and his choice indicates that lie will be
out of the hunt as a playing possibility.
Another is Frank Mann, a mighty hitter who
skippered Middlesex for some years before
his retirement in 1925. 11. D. G. Leveson-
Gower, the third choser of the slain to be,
played for Oxford, Surrey and the Gentlemen,
and is deep in the M.C.C. counsels. All are
South Countrymen, and already a howl of
indignation is going up from the North, with
Lancashire and Yorkshire leading the choir.
* * * *
“Gabba” : Grade cricket in Brisbane closed
last week with Toombul, for which Ron
Oxenham and Hornibrook play, winning
the premiership. Hornibrook showed some
glimpses of his old form before joining the
Australian NI mobilisation in Melbourne,
by taking 4 for 44 in the last match, and
materially helping his side to victory. Though
regretting the omission of Oxenham, and
realising that the choice of the selectors has
fallen on Hornibrook when he was past his-
prime, local opinion is pleased with two men
in the eleven. Only one dyed-in-the-wool
Queenslander has previously gone home with
an Australian team, fast bowler J. W. Mc-
Laren in 1912. Arthur Coningham and
Roger Hartigan were both N.S.W. players
before taking up their quarters in Banana-
land. Hornibrook and Hurwood are both
native sons.
The Watermen
“Lotus Eater”: It has always been the
claim of the scoffer that employment in the
Government service leads inevitably, by
reason of its sedentary and somnolent atmo-
sphere, to rotundity of figure. That there is
some truth in the assertion is proved by the
weights of the crew selected to row for
N.S.W. in the inter-State Public Service
fours. Bow is a manikin of 11 stone, but
No. 2 tips the beam at 13st. 111 b., No. 3 at
14st. and stroke at 12st. 81b. As a dead
secret it is whispered that the bow first
selected had to be dropped because the
for’ard canvas went under water when he got
into the shell. His weight remains a murky
mystery.
* * * *
“Swivel”: There is another aspect to the
proposal to hold the inter-State races for
the King’s Oup every two years (B. 5/3/’3O).
This will give N.S.W. an opportunity to pay
a long overdue return visit to Maoriland, while
the All Black oarsmen in their turn will be able
to visit us more frequently. As matters are
at present Australian crews have neither the
time nor the cash at their disposal for two
long trips a year. If the suggested change
takes place it will be possible for M.L. to visit
Sydney in the blank year, and N.S.W. and
Victoria at least should find little difficulty
in foregathering in Sydney at the same time.
For Maoriland visits all the States would
be able to offer candidates for an all-Aus-
tralia crew.
$ * * *
“Swan” : Westralia’s crew for the King’s
Cup in May is but a shadow of its once
invincible self. Man after man dropped out
until only two of the 1928 winners on the
Nepean were left. Last week Buzolic with-
drew, his place being taken by the emer-
gency, A. Dobson. The only man of last
year’s crew remaining is stroke G. Orgill.
One of Westralia’s best assets in recent years
has been the early selection of the crew, with
consequent months of preparation together,
and this will be absent on the present
occasion.
* * * *
“Po Kee”: Tell ‘-‘Sing Hi” (B. 22/l/’3O)
that the place where the foreigners of. Shang-
hai were accustomed to hold their annual
regatta was actually named Henli, the
foreign spelling of the Chinese place-name.
It is a spot just off the Shanghai-Nanking
railway about two hours from Shanghai.
Last summer the Chinese authorities for-
bade the use of H’enli as a watering-place
for the Shanghai people, alleging that the
congestion of houseboats and the like inter-
fered with the ordinary creek traffic. The
rowing enthusiasts of Shanghai transferred
the regatta to that part of the muddy and
very smelly Whangpoa which is within
international boundaries and is commonly
known as the Point, the western bank of
the Whangpoa River being the site of the
city of Shanghai, and its waterfront Shang-
hai’s famous Bund.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: Date and venue of Aus-
tralia’s opening Davis Cun match with
Switzerland have been settled; the clash
will take place at Zurich on May 3-4-5.
The Switzers have never been a very
formidable factor in European tennis, and the
Australian team should clean them up with-
out difficulty. The opening match against
Italy on the last occasion was a much more
formidable task, for in De Morpurgo Italy
fielded one of the acknowledged European
match-winners, both in doubles and singles.
On top of that came Crawford’s attack of
illness, with no player worthy of the name
to replace him at the last moment. This time
there will be a competent relief if any
player drops out temporarily.
* * * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: In spite of the
jeremiads of my contemporary press tennis
experts, Australia seems in far better case in
the matter of new champions or budding cham-
pions than many other Davis Cup contestants.
France has no startling newcomer in sight,
and the same may be said of America and
Britain, while a sister Dominion in Canada
still selects old-timers like Wright and
Crockett for its first-line troops. With the
possible exception of Willard, none of the
Australians can be classed as veterans, and
even he is still far from the sere and yellow.
if # * *
“Corniche”: W. T. Tilden emerged froni
his tennis retirement the other day in
Europe when he won the final of the Monte
Carlo tournament from Harry Austin, the
young Cambridge and English representative
who was here a little. while ago with
Gregory’s British side. The American went
through the Briton to the tune of 6-4, 6-4,
6-1, which suggests he came home on the
bit. Austin was - outmatched in Australia,
and there are no signs that he has improved,
though he is still rated Britain’s best singles
player. On form, the British team at least
should not check our own on the journey
towards the challenge round.
# * * *
“St. Cloud” : With all the good wishes in
the world for a speedy return to his best
form, other Davis Cup countries will receive
the news that Rene Lacoste will not appear
for France in big tennis this year with
philosophic calm. His temporary absence
will handicap the Cup holders, who are
expected to rely on Cochet and Borotra as
their first string. Cochet is still in a class
by himself, but there has been evidence that
the Basque is by no means his old self on
the courts. The other half of the team may
be recruited from Brugnon —also slipping
somewhat —Boussus or Landry.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: The bad luck attending the
Hagen-Kirkwood tour was continued at
Sydney where, though Hagen was released
from quarantine forthwith, Kirkwood had to
put in a week on North Head. This inter-
fered with the early arrangements for the
tour, and in the meantime Hagen carried
on with the aid of local players. The most
interesting feature of his practice games has
been his unorthodox stance and even stroke
play in some instances—still another proof
of the triumph of the unorthodox which so
often confounds golf pedants. The chief
impression he has made on the local press
experts is that he is a good golfer, a sur-
prising appreciation of the situation in their
case.
* * * *
“Swing th’ Boot”: Frightfulness continues
to rage in the N.S.W. golf war. Last week
the City and Suburban Golf Association,
which is the spearhead of the rising against
the two big metropolitan clubs and their
few minions, threw out most of its officials,
these, including the president, W. A. Win-
deyer, who was succeeded by F. H. Greaves
of Killara club, having taken sides with the
enemy. The move of the Big Pair to turn
the flank of the rebels by applying for regis-
tration of their own golf association has
also been frustrated. Following representa-
tions that the applicants did not stand for
the majority of N.S.W. golfers, officialdom
pigeon-holed the matter. Meanwhile the oppos-
ing sides are mobilising their reserves in
expectation of a break-through by one or
the other.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: That elaborate building
and reconditioning scheme of the Royal
Melbourne golf club (B. 19/2/’3O) is not
going through in its present form if the more
economical section of the membership can
help it. The objectors arc of the opeenion
that saxty thoosan’ pun’ is tae much ava.
and are preparing a ticket for the next
annual meeting and elections of officials,
when all those championing the extra-a-
vagance will be opposed.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: An appalling calamity was
narrowly averted the other day at the Royal
Queensland golf club. A short-sighted mem-
ber proposed at the annual meeting that the
club institute postal voting for the election
of officers. Fortunately, someone pointed out
there were legal difficulties which might
result in the closing of the Nineteenth Hole
until the elections were completed. The
Queensland licensing laws forbid the dis-
pensing of alcoholic liquor between the hours
of 10 a.m. and 6-p.m. on the day of any
election.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The N.S.W, golf side to
battle in M.L. for the Kirk-Windeyer Cup
on April 16-17 has caused some surprise.
Eric Apperly and C. H. Fawcett were not
available, but the inclusion of Lee Brown
and W. R. Dobson, neither of whom _ has
done much for some time past, has stirred
the critics. However, Brown, like Dobson,
helped to bring the cup back from Maoriland
a couple of years ago, so the maxim “Horses
for courses” may stand them in good stead in
the Dominion this time. H. W. Hattersley,
one of the young entry, is one of the
mightiest smiters in Australia, but a bit
uncertain after leaving the tee. S. A. Keane
is also full of promise. He figured in the
State team in Victoria last year.
* * # *
“Delia”: Here is a case for the .Rules of
Golf experts, the matter of whether it
occurred in fact or just in the imagination of
the onlookers not being of paramount import-
ance. A country golfer had to win the last
hole to clinch the match. His putt stopped
an inch short of the hole. Hurling his
putter into infinity, he leapt high into the
air as a preliminary to commenting on the
situation. He was a large and heavy man,
and the tremor which followed as he landed
on the green again joggled the ball into the
hole. Writer once saw a fight in a billiard-
room, the aggressor in which alleged that a
sneeze by one of the spectators had shaken
his opponent’s ball into a pocket for a win-
ning score. In that case the incident was
taken as an “act of God” and the score, stood
good, so the same principle may apply in the
case quoted.

MONEY IN WHALES
NORWEGIANS PAY BIG DIVIDENDS. AUSTRALIAN COMPANY FORMED.
Norwegian Whalers have established highly profitable industries on the products of areas which, rightly speaking, should
be exploited by Australian enterprise. Last year the gross takings from Whale Products in Southern waters exceeded
£8,000,000. It is, therefore, satisfactory that Australian investors are at last to be given opportunities of reaping a share
of this golden harvest.
The Australian Whaling Company, Ltd. (authorised capital £750,000) has gone to allotment with applications for 75,000 shares.
This company has acquired—as a going concern—a whaling station on the coast of Western Australia. During the past
four whaling seasons 3445 whales were captured at this station —gross realisations amounting to £553,830.
LATEST WHALING NEWS
Late cables from London, on 2nd Jan., 1930, report several Whaling
Companies paying dividends ranging from 20 to 35 per cent.;
Rosshavet Co., Vestfold Co., Sydhavet Co. and Viking Co. paid
25 per cent, each; carrying large sums to reserves. The Hektor
Whaling Co. (one of the new companies) paid 25 per cent, on
first year’s operations. On 10th Feb., 1930, Sir Douglas Mawson
reported that “West of Enderby Land whales were found to be
exceptionally abundant”; bearing out his remarks in “Sun,” 9tl>
Dec., 1928: “Almost at the doors of Australia lie mighty stretches
of sea teeming with wealth—a number of whaling companies have
a gross return of £500,000 p.a. and pay dividends of from 40 to
100 per cent.”

“Whoosh”: With Kaye Don’s attempt on
the world’s speed record imminent and
another by Australian Norman Smith loom-
ing in the near distance, the pioneers of the
game in Australia deserve passing reference.
The first record over a mile was put up by
a Queenslander, A. Jewell, on Southport
Beach in 1916, when the very good average
of 81.81 m.p.h. was recorded. The name of
the car was not preserved, queerly enough. It
was nine years before D. J. Harkness,
with a Hispano-Suiza aeroplane engine in a
Minerva chassis, raised the ante to 107.14
m.p.h. Then came Maorilander C. W. Hamil-
ton with 109.09 m.p.h. on Oreti Beach, to be
followed by Norman Smith with his recent
records.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: The latest capital-to-capital re-
cord was made by Syd Jenkins and A.
James, two racing motorists of Melbourne,
who left Yarraville before breakfast in an
Essex, heard the town clock chime in Adel-
aide, and got back to Melbourne in time
for lunch on the following day. The run of
1190 miles was done in 91ir. 57min. better
time than the previous record, the actual
driving time being 32hr. 12min.
# * * *
“Lapis”: That Daytona beach memorial
(B. 26/2/’3O) is not to be reared to
Chasseloup-Laubaut alone, though he first
established a speed record on the Florida
sands, On the monument will be inscribed
the name of everyone who has put up new
records since the Frenchman knocked up
39 m.p.h. After him 25 drivers have put
up new figures on 31 occasions, Segrave
being the first to pass the 200-m.p.li. mark
in 1927. Other famous drivers, alive and
passed on, who will figure on the list are
Barney Oldfield, Ralph de Palma, Malcolm
Campbell and Ray Keech.
* * * *
“0.H.V.”: Percy Coleman, who has been
selected to represent M.L. at this year’s
Tourist Trophy races on the Isle of Man,
is one of the pioneer racing motor-cyclists
of the Dominion; his record runs back
quite 20 years. He is equally at home on
dirt tracks, asphalt or concrete, and has
probably more wins to his credit than any
other M.L. rider. He favors big twins—-the
more powerful the it will take
him some time to get used to the 500-c.c.
mounts which are the limit of power allowed
in the T.T. senior solo event.
**.*’.*
“Hotliam”: The opening day of the Aus-
tralian amateur cycling championships at Mel-
bourne Motordrome last week proved a tri-
umph for D. Gray, who won the mile and five-
mile events. Indeed, the N.S.W. contingent
filled all three places in both races, though
riding on a strange track. The time for the
mile was 2min. 12 2-ssec., and for the five
miles lOmin. 41 2-ssec. Figures for the mile
are 3-ssec. better than the Australian record
standing in L. G. Munro’s name, while A.
Bassett’s time for the five-mile event. 12min.
2 2-ss.ec., also took a knock back. The mile
junior championship went to L. Fitzgerald,
of Queensland, in 2min. 21 4-ssec. The
rider was not selected for his State, so,
selling his sailing-boat to provide funds, he

championship winner, who will captain

made the trip on his own and raced as a
freelance. A feature of the meet-
ing was the reappearance of South Aus-
tralian riders in the championships after
a lapse of 35 years.
* * $ $
“Fitzcray”: The Australian hour record
for a push-bike following motor-pace was
broken on Melbourne Motordrome the other
day, when Victorian “Ossie” Nicholson
covered 55 miles 910 yards, with Bob Finlay
handling the motor-bike. The previous best
was Opperman’s 53 miles 953 yards. For 45
miles Nicholson averaged five miles every
smin. 25sec. He took 6min. 25see. for the
next five miles, but, coming again, finished
the final five in 4min. 25sec. He streaked
over several laps in 22 4-5 sec., almost 57
m.p.h.
* * * *
“Toe-clip”: There was quite a lot of
barney after the 10-mile Australasian cham-
pionship had been run at Christchurch
last month. Phil O’Shea was first across
the tape, with W. T. Weir, another well-
known M.L. rider, second, and L. W. Hill,
an employee of O’Shea’s, third. There was
a complaint that Hill deliberately ran wide
The late JOHN BROWN, who owned
many great horses, notably Prince
Foote.
when a rider named Jordan was making a
sprint at the finish, and forced him off the
track. O’Shea’s version was that he sus-
pected he was to be the victim of team
tactics, and that he warded off a vicious
attempt by Jordan to run him off the track.
Hill pleaded a flat tyre as the cause of' a
wobble. The verdict, Solomonic in its
summing-up of evidence, was: Weir 1,
O’Shea 2, Jordan 3.
Miscellaneous
“Backwoodsman”: The Australian bowling
carnival at Launceston came to a glorious
end with the usual Victorian victory. Only
a few N.S.W. players put in an appearance,
but it is doubtful if the appearance of the
Ma State’s full strength would have made
any difference. The singles championship
was won by A. Stanley of the Moreland
club, from a fellow-Victorian in A. Bruce.
The winner first learned to play bowls at
Ulverstone (Tas.), so the Speck was in the
position of the legendary eagle pierced by a
shaft feathered from its own wing.
* * * *
“Mat”: The Canadian bowlers, while they
have had a pretty good time during their
short tour of some of the Australian States,
have not done much in the way of record-
breaking feats. Their play is hampered by the
outlandish bowls many of them employ,
woods that have created wild surmise even in
the bosoms of the sophisticated official bowl-
testers in the various States they have
visited. The season is short, too, in Canada,
lasting barely four months, whereas Aus-
tralians play every day in the year and many
of the nights as well.
“Cascade”: Speaking at the recent pan-
Australian gathering of bowlers at Laun-
ceston, Jim Wall, one of the N.S.W. grand-
masters of the mystery, pointed out as an
illustration of the compelling power of the
cult that some Westralian bowlers had
travelled 3000 miles to be present. They had
not, he said, come all that way to play
bowls, either. One would think not. After
a trek of that length the compelling motive
on arrival would naturally be the grand
old cause of prohibition.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
“Ride-Off”: Harden Polo Club, for some
years Undisputed champions of N.S.W. until
Goulburn cut their combs in the Dudley
Cup last season, had a great time at the
Victorian carnival. The side, which included
C. E. Skene in place of one of the Ross
brethren, retained the inter-Dominion trophy,
the Australasian Gold Cup, beating Carra-
mut (Vic.) 7-4 to 6-16. Scores were 6 all at
time, and extra chukkas were ordered. The
Welshmen took the Stradbroke Cup also,
Carramut again being the adversary in the
final. This was another fiercely contested
game, Harden winning by 6 goals' 18 behinds
to 4 goals 12 behinds.
“Splash.”: The professional athlete can
teach the pothunting amateur little in the
matter of ways that are dark. Swimmers
seem particularly “clever” in this respect.
The N.S.W. swimming authorities, who
should be used to it by now, nearly threw a
fit recently when one guileless competitor
won a short competition race in eight
seconds better than the handicap guaranteed
by his club officials. Another, competing
in a night surf race, took advantage of the
poor light to dodge going round the turning
buoy. Instead lie waited half-way up the
home lap, and finished like a hydroplane in
first place. Fortunately he was detected, but
what about others like him?
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: Randolph Rose, at his best
one of the greatest distance-runners M.L. or
any other country has produced, emerged after
two years’ absence from the tracks to give
American Leo Lermond a gallop at Welling-
ton over a mile. Savidan, another topnotch
local performer, also competed, but the finish
was fought out between Rose and the
American, the latter getting home by inches
in 4min. 21 4-ssec. In 1926 the* flying
Randolph ran the mile at Masterton (M.L.)
on a grass track in 4min. 13 3-ssec. The
world’s record by Paavo Nurmi is 4min.
10 2-ssec.
* * * * .
“Narque” : TJiose folk who, platitudinise
about the benefits accruing to sport from the
exchange of international visits might ponder
on the results of the recent tour of Dr,
Peltzer. That gentleman was the cause of
an unholy row on Sydney Cricket Ground
because he refused to run save under con-
ditions imposed by himself. This fact was
communicated to the press by J. C. Allison,
hon. see. of the N.S.W. Amateur Athletic
Association. The association seized the first
opportunity of airing its ears in public, and
called upon the official to resign. The
treasurer thereupon resigned in protest
against the treatment of his colleague, and
all was abuse and recrimination. The
association says the sec.’s revelations made
it look foolish. If so, hb took unnecessary
trouble.
* * * *
“Birkenhead Park”: The British Rugby
team to tour M.L. and Australia is made up
of 2 full-backs, 8 three-quarters, 4 halves and
15 forwards. England contributes 12, in-
cluding 2 Army reps., Wales 5 and Ireland
6, one being an Air Force forward. Scot-
land sends a solitary forward from the
famous old Hawick club, which had three
players in the first Rugby side to visit Aus-
tralia, that captained by R, L. Seddon and
later by A. E. Stoddart, in 1888. Only five
are not internationals, all being county caps
from Yorkshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, North-
umberland, and Glamorgan respectively. The
Glamorgan man is a member of the famous
Cardiff club side.
* * * *
“Gate”: The N.S.W. and Queensland
Rugby League players returned from England
last week, and were received with the accla-
mation and honors that they deserved. The
management reports a profit on the tour of
over £7OOO, this being the outstanding item
in the bright lexicon of professional football.
The team, did very well in the North of
England, in Spite of the casualties insepar-
able from tours of this sort, and even went
so far out of the League beat as to play
missionary matches at Cardiff, Wembley and
Newcastle. Of the 35 matches played 9 were
lost, which compares - favorably with the
records of previous League teams. The
management’s report supplies one or two
humorous touches. One is that the team beat
the “champion county,” Lancashire. As only
a part of two counties, Lancashire and
Yorkshire, play the professional Code, the
feat is not so outstanding as might appear
if the League were like the Union, with
nearly every county in Britain and Ireland,
apart from club and university football,
playing in county competitions.
“Fitzcray”: The Victorian Football League
has been so accustomed to calling the tune
that it went berserk when it found that the
other (State delegates to the Australian Foot-
ball Council had thrown out all its suggested
alterations of the laws of the game. There
has been wild talk of refusing to be dictated
to by the presumptuous minions from out-
side the Cabbage Garden, and a general
strike has been advocated. In other words,
the Vic. body was to refuse to carry out the
council’s decision, and thus ensure itself
being thrown out by that august body.
However, wiser councils have prevailed, and
the League is comforting itself with the
thought of its £2600 credit balance.
❖ . * #
“Outside Left”: There’s a flavor of old
times about the semi-finals for the British
Association Cup. For the first time since
1897 Notts Forest is one of the survivors,
the once-famous Lacemakers winning that
year from their neighbors, Derby County.
The Northern and Southern clubs have had
such a monopoly of the Cup finals for years
past that the appearance of the old team
comes in the nature of a glorious resurrec-
tion.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Have you
ordered
Kraft Cheese?
John Brown was dapper to the end.
Women who knew the great tragedy of his
life were gentler to him than his manner
sometimes invited. Most people of this
generation thought of him as an old bachelor.
Actually he was married at Glasgow over
50 years ago; but his young wife had a
recurrence of an incurable illness soon after
marriage, and for the few remaining years
of her life it was out of her power to
comfort him. There were no children of
that marriage, and neither of his two brothers,
William and Stephen, had an heir. Stephen
is still alive; William died a couple of years
ago. One sister remains—Mrs. Nairn.
Will Archbishop Kelly bring the red hat
hack with him from Rome? —the question is
being pondered .wherever clerics and R.C.’s
band together. But what does a cardinal’s
hat signify, after all, to one who can wear
a completed St. Mary’s on his tonsure, so
to speak? At SO does a priest care what mil-
linery is being built for him in the iCity of
the Seven Hills? Still, if Cardinal Moran’s
definition of old age is correct, 80 even to
an archbishop is comparative youth. The
Cardinal with the witty tongue was one day
amidst a company of contemporaries when
somebody remarked: “A man is old when
his brain is old.” Another said: “A man’s
as old as he feels.” Still another laughed:
“A man’s as old as he looks.” The Car-
dinal smiled slyly. “Not at all,” he said.
“Just consider tlie looks of all of u 5”....
“Well, then,” they cried, “tell us when is a
man old?” The Cardinal shot a whimsical
look out of his fine eyes. “Why,” he said,
“that man is old who is 10 years older than
oneself.”
On his travels the Archbishop will be
accompanied by Father Peter Murphy. They
will be away about six months : one month
will be spent in Rome, a week at the
Eucharistic Congress at Carthage and two
months in Ireland, where the Archbishop was
born —80 years ago. Father Murphy is an
Australian priest, born on the Upper Hun-
ter. His family in this generation has
given itself almost wholly to the church;
he has five sisters who are nuns.
What a delightful and courtly manner has
Monsignor O’Haran ! He was an outstand-
ing personality at the tea-drinking staged
by the Catholic Women’s Association to say
farewell to Archbishop Kelly. The club-
rooms in Oxford-street were the rallying-
place, so the Monsignor hadn’t far to carry
the cheque for £5OO which was the gift of
the Sacred Heart Church in Darlinghurst to
Dr. Kelly. A leather writing-case from the
association and a leather wallet and a book
of autographs from the younger set were
other trifles his Grace packed into his home-
going car.
Sir Hugh Poynter and his lady have quite
settled down in Sydney. They have bought
a house in Warrawee'named Tikinui. It is
a mellow brick place comfortably enclosed
from the outer world by trees, lawns and
a vegetable garden. Along the whole length
of the sheltered side run a verandah and
balcony, the tiles of both furnished with
Persian and Turkish rugs, each with its
history. Here is a table covered with a
cloth of Bokhara embroidery. That is very
beautiful. There’s an old tea-stain on it.
That was made by Lady Poynter’s father-in-
law, the artist Edward Poynter, one after-
noon when Alma Tadema came to drink a
dish of tea. Everywhere are sketches —
sketches by “cousin John Kipling,” Rud-
yard’s father; by Edward Poynter; by Sir
Hugh when he was a little boy of 11 and he
and his father sat side by side painting
the same Moorish scene. Here are letters
from Rudyard Kipling, signed “Rudy,” as
his letters always are to intimates. Here’s a
first edition of Milton, the paper, type and
calf binding still in beautiful order —that was
a prized possession of Edward Poynter’s.
Near by are huge volumes bound in white
and tan kid. These relate to the Royal
Armory and were gifts from King Edward,
as the inscription tells, to the elder Poynter.
Priceless Chinese jades jostle Japanese Sat-
sumas, and books of Japanese prints show
fish and birds disporting on silk with a free-
dom of motion and an accuracy of detail
seldom seen in company.
A Persian helmet in silver, complete with
nose piece, stands on a table as though invit-
ing you to wear it when you walk in the
garden. Near it are the complete published
works of Kipling, given by the author to
his cousin as a wedding present, along with
an unpublished poem written specially for
the two friends. From a drawer comes a
manuscript written by the same author at
the age of eight, and his book of poems,
published by his mother and father when
he was a schoolboy in India. Lou
camel bags and rugs, and a perfect model
of the first vessel in existence. —it makes its
journey by a series of revolutions; such are
still in use on the Bosphorous. An old
Elizabethan chest is stored with Persian
embroideries —dragons done in lotus blue;
Bokhara and Chinese and Armenian
stitchery, some of it modern, much of it done
centuries ago. But the best part of each
beautiful thing is its association. Every
treasure calls up a name famous in literature,
art or diplomacy, for, apart from the Edward
Poynter and Kipling connections, Lady Poyn-
ter’s father was for many years ambassador
in Turkey.
Mrs. W. A. Holman has rejoined her
K.C. husband after a 12 months’ holiday
with daughter Portia in England. The
Arts Club stretched the hand of welcome to
the returned voyager the other afternoon,
and at the same time sped the departing
Mrs. Herbert Field on her way. The club
ballroom, where the party was held, grew
more and more crowded as the afternoon
wore on. President Mrs. Florence Taylor,
in a flowing white frock, made speeches and
presented bouquets. Mrs. .Holman’s black
chiffons were patterned in pink roses nearly
as realistic as the ones that filled her
presentation basket. Mrs. Field’s frocking
was in tones of beige. Mrs. Harry Twigden
arranged the music.
Ruth Bedford’s delightful fancies have
been woven into verse and prose that is
known the
Continent
over. Lately
she extended
her field, and
published a
book, “Fairies
and Fancies,”
in London.
This met with
such a good
reception that
Helen Simp-
son (now Mrs.
Brown her
husband is a
doctor in Il'ar-
-1 e y - s t r eet)
tried to per-
suade her old
Sydney friend
to pitch her
camp within
coo-ee of Fleet-
street. Ruth’s
best-known effort as a novelist is “The
Little Blue Devil,” which she and Dorothea
Mackellar wrote in collaboration.
B. E. Minus’s exhibition of abo. paintings
is at Rubery Bennett’s gallery, in King-
street, and the vital little wife of the Chief
Justice declared it open. But buyers had
been before her, and the cheerful red seal
blinked from many a frame. Simple, direct
and altogether admirable was the lady’s
speech, and when she remarked that it was
over 20 years since she and her Chief Justice
had bought their first picture from Mr.
Minns and that they draw as much delight
from it now- as they did then, the gallery
crackled with applause. The lady presented
a that must have commended
itself to the water-colorist instincts of both
Minns and Florence Mofflin. Her frock was
delft blue and white, her tiny tuscan hat was
banded in apple green, and the roses Mrs.
Minns presented to her were delicately pink.
Artist McNally, who introduced her, toned in
with a dove-grey suit, a lavender tie and a
buff walking-cane. Brother artist John
Banks stood to attention above buff gloves
and a black cane. Mrs. Minns wore vellum
georgettes, and the exhibitor looked at once
shy and pleased amid a storm of congratu-
lations.
One of the most delighted visitors was
art-collector Oakden. This gentleman,
79 years young, has lived most of his life
among the abos. in North Queensland. In
the early days of his settling he had skir-
mishes with the fighting warriors, and
worked his holdings with the more tractable
abo. Minns’s “Australian Aboriginal in
War Paint” he declared perfect in every
detail. But beyond mere reproduction of
face and form the artist has sensed the
wistful melancholy that for ever lies in the
soul of a conquered race. It’s a show worth
seeing, and any woman on a slimming diet
could sigh with envy over the slim flat flanks
of the abo. in peace or in war.
Other interesting people at the show were
the J. Burgess couple (she’s of the Belltrees
White clan), who own one of the finest
collections of pictures, old furniture and
china in Sydney, and architect . Ketliel —
he was responsible for the “Sun” building
and in his early days was a black-and-white
artist of some renown.
The Feminists, having declined to be
absorbed in the United Association, are now
playing a lone hand in the women’s move-
ment. Mrs. Kenneth Street is the president
of the newly-formed group, while redoubtable
Miss Preston Stanley has been re-elected to
lead the Feminists. The United Association
will have the benefit of more funds than the
old-established club, for it includes the
Women’s League, the Women Voters Asso-
ciation and the Women’s Service Club; but
will the ladies who have been head-serangs
grow restive when they find themselves just
a voice amid the multitude? Both groups
aim at abolishing or lessening social evils,
especially as they touch women and children.
The Feminists express their intentions “to
adopt a women’s charter which will embody
principles and indicate those objectives which
will afford simple justice and full expression
to women, politically, economically and
legally.” Miss Preston Stanley, good tac-
tician, got in early with her broadside, and
when the Uniteds got together a night or
two later their platform sounded a good
deal like an echo. But while the palm for
tactics and oratory may go to the J eminist
leader, there is nothing to choose between
the two bodies where good intentions and
honest endeavor are concerned.
If you can’t speak of putts and tees and
drives these days, you keep a quiet tongue.
Golf has leaped into the arena and snatched
the spotlight from that diehard bridge. With
the arrival of Walter Hagen and Kirkwood
golfing togs and tools have become of fierce
importance, and the Manly and Elanora
links during the week-end, where Hagen was
playing exhibition games, were populous with
sporting Eves as well as Adams.
At any gathering in a Jewish home nowa-
days the hat is likely to go round “Fot the
trees.” The collection is for tree-planting in
Palestine, where the Jews are busy on re-
afforestation work —a process all the more
interesting to Australians since it is our
own good gums that are being grown. About
six shillings pays for a tree, and the plant-
ing in Palestine is considered a suitable way
in which friends, by putting in their small
amounts, can celebrate the birthday of little
Miriam, ,the Barmitzali (confirmation) ot
Issy, or the wedding of Racine —or for that
matter when a Minyon is gathered together,
pay tribute to the memory of Grandma
Rebecca. It is a pretty notion; put into
effect all over the world it is giving its
life back to a denuded land.
Those who know- the splendid work of the
.Church of England Home for Girls at Glebe
look upon it as a memorial to Matron Gar-
vey. For 35 years she has impressed her
personality on this institution, and it was
owing to her influence that the girls, how-
ever poor, were not of necessity trained to
qualify for domestic service. Whenever a
girl showed taste and talent she had her
chance to develop it. Now the lady is retir-
ing owing to ill-health, and Anglican Sydney
has risen to the occasion and given a splen-
did woman a fitting good-bye. With a pre-
sentation it took place in the vestibule of
the Town Hall under the direction of Mrs.
Arthur Scrivener.
Herewith Florence Blake (Florence Mof-
flin), who goes back to England and hard
work by the Orford. Florence is represented
in the' National Gallery by two fans that
the Pompa-
dour herself
would not
have dis-
dained, and is
now throwing
all her energy
into portrait
work. This
has been her
study at the
Slade school
for over 12
months, and
she tried her
cunning in a
portrait of
Victor Mann,
former director
of the gallery,
and entered
the very good
result for the
Archibald
prize. Two
things lure Miss Mofflin back to London.
They are her flat in Chelsea and the pre-
valence of professional models. In Sydney
girls only become models, it seems, when
they are hard up, and when another job
offers they leave off being Godivas for some-
thing which will be more likely to earn
silk-stocking pay. The result is that the
poor artist for the most part struggles along
with amateur sitters who develop all sorts
of fads. One girl said seriously to Miss
Mofflin she couldn’t sit unless she read
Edgar Wallace. May Moore made the
picture.
Bridge, of course, was considered a suitable
relaxation for the guests when Sydney engi-
neers bade visitors to the conference of their
craft to a party last week. But, as the affair
was housed in the Wentworth, jazz proved a
strong rival to cards, and soon after Mr.
and Mrs. A. Maughan had murmured their
welcomes the floor of the ballroom was
crowded. President of the institution Har-
ricks brought, his wife, who wore black
satin. Tlie ex-Oanberra Butterses came, she
flashing opulent black and silver; the Cor-
lettes, from Newcastle, put a smile into the
night; the knightly Braddons, the Bradfields,
totalisator Julius and his wife, the Justs
from Brisbane, the Laytons and engineers
from every part of Australia riveted partners
and stepped out dashingly.
Attractive Louise Chautard slipped un-
obtrusively into matrimony last week at
St. Philip’s, on Church Hill. Anderson
Gair, of the Orient Co., was partner in the
deed, which was visM by Padre E. A. Fer-
guson. In contrast to the bride’s white
frock and summer felt hat were the tricolor
in her maid’s attire —frock of blue and red
chiffon and hat of white felt. Both were
served with bouquets to taste, and Ronald
Duncan best-manned.
There was a military atmosphere about
the wedding of Muriel Esther Martin and
Dudley Scott, for the bride is a daughter
of General Martin, of Rose Bay, and Dud-
ley’s father is Colonel Scott, of Melbourne.
The knot was tied within St. John’s, in
Darlinghurst, and later the bridegroom, his
bride, in her ivory satins, her three ’maids,
in swaying pink moires, and a great com-
pany of guests sought the . Ambassadors.
Here, the General being detained in Mel-
bourne, Mrs. Martin, lone-handed, did the
honors. After the honeymoon in Melbourne
the Dudley Scotts will live at I-lillgrove,
Wagga.
One of the Burwood Traills was a victim
of •' the long bow last week. He was Dr.
Eric Traill and he wore the quivering arrow-
in his heart to the glory of Marjorie Cocks.
Her heart being likewise skewered, they
sought balm in matrimony, and the same
was applied by Padre Hynes at the Lindfield
Methodist church. Ivory satin, a mist of
tulle and orchids mixed with frangipanni
went to the bride’s array, and roseate tulle
and satin gleamed and drifted about her
three attendants, Mrs. MacCredie Luker,
Mrs. Fred Barnett and Winnie Cocks.
Another of the three Graces is flashing an
engagement ring. It is Joan, the youngest
of the A. E. Graces, of Broadway and Rose
Bay. Kenneth McCathie, a son of the old-
established Pitt-street raggery, is the young
man.
“Oxberry” natives are of such tough stock
that Mrs. Sarah ICilduff, the heroine of an
episode of the long-ago, who died the other
day at Drummoyne, may have been considered
comparatively young, at S 9, to cross over.
Her father kept the first inn at old Windsor ;
her husband built and occupied the first house
at Riverstone. During the great floods of
’G7 the Kilduff house was threatened; but
the young wife took her babies one by one
across the saddle and swam her horse to
safety.
Quiet and demure in appearance, novelist
Edith Lyttleton becomes the dashing G. B.
Lancaster once she takes her pen in hand.
She is back in Sydney after a long stay in
Maoriland, in which country, although really
a Tasmanian, she passed most of her girl-
hood. She travels from Sydney to Brisbane,
then to Java and Singapore, and on to
London and her publishers.
Trixie Tange is going to the suburbs in
search of her expenses to America later in
the year: she set up her grand-piano at the
Anzac Memorial Hall in Mosman last night.
She has the promise of engagements in the
U.S.A., and if money, can be raised by deter-
mination and enterprise, the gold-topped girl
will greet the Statue of Liberty in time for
the concert season. Violinist Cyril Monk
was the associate artist and Mrs. Cyril pro-
vided the accompaniments.
Two presswomen spending holidays in
Sydney are Mliss Jones, of Auckland, and
Alice Gore Jones, of Brisbane. Alice, who is
on the “Telegraph,” is a verse-writer of
some distinction, and the Maoriland lady
makes a hobby of painting—she specialises in
water-colors, and is having a hectic time
dashing from one gallery to another. Minus's
show of abos. at Bennett’s Gallery in King-
street ensnared her. The two were guests of
the Society of Women Writers last week.
This is a Kind to Animals Week story
that comes from one of the most exclusive
kiddies’ schools: —
Small Girl Lavinia ( to small boy) : “Do you
lova animals ?”
Small Boy: “Ye-es!”
Small Girl: “Would you like to be kind to all
oi them?”
Small Boy: rt Ooh, yes!”
Small Girl: “Would you like to be kind to the
monkeys in the Zoo?”
Small Boy: “Yes!”
Small Girl : “Well, why don’t you give your
face back to them?”
The small boy considered this a moment,
then turned and fled. And just as a sym-
pathetic teacher was making her way over
to restore his self-respect she heard him tell-
ing a small replica of Mary Pickford about
it. Mary was one of the comforting sort.
“That’s silly,” she said. “Lavinia couldn’t
do it herself.”
OVERHEARD.
He: “What a musical old girl!”
She: “That! Why, she can’t play a note!”
He : “Maybe; hut she’s all crotchets and quavers.”

The remarkable value of Yeast for Better Health is everywhere recognised. The
world’s leading scientific men have unanimously reported in _ favor of it
for intestinal and digestive disorders, skin troubles, faulty elimination, “run-
down” conditions and other ills. It is most important, however, that the public
should realise that yeast, to be 100 per cent, effective, must be activated, and
that it is incorrect to suppose that any kind of yeast will give the same bene-
ficial results as genuine Cream of Yeast.
Brewers’ yeast alone does not work at its best as a remedy for everyday ills and “below-par”
conditions. So the greatest chemical organisation in the world manufacturing medicinal yeast,
after considerable research and experience, evolved the special activated compound form known as
Cream of Yeast.
This is a highly-compressed yeast, scientifically combined with other perfectly safe medicinal
agents of known therapeutic value in such a way as yastly to increase th. value of yeast for
remedial purposes. In Cream of Yeast is offered a handy medicine giving prompt benefit with
absolute certainty.
Cream of Yeast gives you the following benefits
(PLAIN BREWERS’ YEAST DOES NOT GIVE THESE BENEFITS)-.—.
Headaches relieved in 4 minutes. Acidity, Sour Stomach and Indigestion relieved in 3 minutes. Rheumatic Attacks, Influenza Colds, etc., countered within
15 hours. Depression and “Brain Fag” banished in 8 minutes. Nerves steadied in 10 minutes. Energy increased within 15 minutes. Abdominal pains relieved
in 12 minutes
Try this modern Remedy for yourself, but remember that you must get Cream of Yeast if you want the best results. More Cream of Yeast is sold
than all other yeast medicines combined, yet Cream of Yeast costs very little, a flask of 24 Tablets being 1/11, 48 Tablets 3/6, or 125 Tablets 5/9.
Since any good chemist can supply you, why not let this remarkable remedy rid you of those ailments that now mar your health and good looks?
The very first dose of Cream of Yeast will convince you of its merit. Truly, CREAM OF YEAST IS LIFE I

Synopsis : Boyd McCurdie had
left Abernethy station before the
war to study law in Sydney, where
he enlisted. There were other rea-
sons for his going. His mother had
been dead some years, and his father
had proposed marrying again. Also,
old McCurdie’s dominating energy had
rather overwhelmed him. Meanwhile,
McCurdie had married, but his young
wife had never become quite recon-
ciled to station life. McCurdie, who
had represented his electorate in Par-
liament, had lost the seat over too-
pronounced utterances during the
war, and financial troubles had made
him sell out various station and other
interests and concentrate on Aber-
nethy. The story begins with him
anxiously awaiting Boyd’s return after
years at the tear. At Abernethy
Boyd feels influences at work to
hold him to the station. He meets
again Josie Duncan, who has black
blood in her and is the home-
stead housemaid. Also, he is visited
by Barbara Mahon —as she formerly
was. She has married during Boyd’s
absence a doctor named Day, and is
temporarily up from Sydney, house-
keeping for her brother Leo. Boyd
senses that there has been a break
between Barbara and her husband.
He visits Barbara several times, and
eventually decides to stay, though his
father does not like to give over the
reins altogether. Boyd dislikes and
distrusts Billy Mace, a rolling-stone
horsebreaker, who is paying some atten-
tion to Josie. Mrs. McCurdie (Ada),
who knows Barbara is in love with
Boyd, goes with McCurdie for a holi-
day. Barbara becomes moody towards
Boyd, and does not answer a note he
has written.
CHAPTER XV ( Continued).
THE doubts and uncertainties that had
troubled Boyd for the past few weeks
brought a sense of confusion to his
mind as he rode over the mulga ridges and
cracked plains. Was he in love with Bar-
bara, he asked himself? He could not be
sure. His feeling for her was so natural
a development of the affection he had had
for her as a child; there was little of the
drive of passion in it. Hardly ever, when
he was with her, could he forget that she
was another man’s wife. The consciousness
of that chilled him, restrained him, laid a
controlling hand upon his senses. She and
Frank Day might not be happy together,
but the fact that she never admitted it
sharpened an obscure sense of honor in
him that he did not analyse.
“Keep away,” it urged him. “And you
don’t know what you want, anyhow.”
He could not keep away from her en-
tirely, though. He depended too much on
her company, on the bright flow of her
comment, on the vitality she poured into
the life around her. In the last few weeks
he had realised how dull he could be
without the stimulus of her presence. There
was a pleasant excitement in his blood as
he rode up to the homestead, and he ex-
pected to see Barbara spring up from the
lounge on the verandah and toss aside her
magazine as she came to greet him. An
air of lethargy hung over the place, though,
a definite feeling of emptiness. He could
see no sign of activity anywhere till Leo
emerged from a shed at the back in a pair
of greasy dungarees, fingering a spanner
with which he had been tinkering with his
car.
“Hullo!” came his cheery greeting. “Come
in and have a drink. On your pat now,
aren’t you? When did the old man go
away?”
“This morning,” Boyd told him. “They’re
driving overland to the coast. Lord alone
knows when they’re coming back. Not at
all, I should think, if Ada has the last
word.”
“Well, good luck,” said Leo, pouring out
a couple of stiff nips from the decanter.
“I’m on my own, too. Haven’t got a cook,
even. Barbara went off a fortnight ago.”
Boyd stopped with the glass half-raised
to his lips.
“Went off? Where?”
“Why, home, of course,” Leo told him.
“She was only waiting on till after the
races.”
There was a casualness in the way he
spoke, and his averted eyes gave no hint
that he recognised anything unexpected in
the situation. Neither did the expression
on his amiable/rather stupid face; yet his
very indifference helped to swell the current
of obscure passion that swept over Boyd.
He was angry in a way that surprised him-
self. It was as if Barbara had wantonly
violated something in him and in herself.
“You don’t mean to tell me she’s gone
back to that fellow?” he jerked out.
“Who? Her husband?” Leo said, raising
his eyebrows. “Why, she never left him—•
not in the way you mean.”
“Not when she came up here and brought
all her things?”
“No,” said Leo. “She’s done that before.
Spent nearly a year here when the doc.
was away on a troopship. Barbara’s fond
of this old place—fonder than I am, even.
She likes coming back for long spells.”
There was a dogged, rather boyish look
about him as he stood with his legs apart
and his shoulders hunched slightly, shovel-
ling tobacco into his pipe from his pouch.
It was almost as though he felt called on
to defend his sister from attack. But the
stream of dull anger flowing through Boyd
was still in full flood.
“This is all eyewash, Leo,” he said im-
patiently. “You surely don’t pretend that
Barbara and that fellow live happily to-
gether?”
“Has she told you they don’t?” Leo
challenged.
“No,” Boyd admitted. “We never talked
about it.”
“Same here,” said Leo. “Barbara doesn’t
gabble about her private affairs, even with
me. Perhaps she and Day don’t hit it
exactly, but how many married people can
hang out the sign, 'Nothing the matter
here’? All this damned gossip because a
woman comes home for a few months! It’s
enough to make a dog sick. There are
some old women around here who’d start
a scandal if they saw two birds sitting
together on a dead limb Here, let’s
have another drink.”
He switched the talk round to the dif-
ficulty of getting a housekeeper, and the
way badly-cooked meals gave him wind
around the heart. Boyd, looking at his
hearty, sun-darkened face, with its little
black moustache, wondered whether he was
really obtuse about Barbara or whether
he was merely throwing out a smoke-screen
like she did. But again there was a pos-
sibility that his attitude to the affair was
the straightforward and sensible one. What
was there in a little friction between two
married people to make a fuss about, even
if one of them was his sister? He might
know that they got along well enough
together; he was in a position to judge
how things stood between them. And
Barbara might have told him more than
he admitted
Yet in spite of his attempt to view the
affair in the cool light of reason, he had a
sense of being thwarted, of having run up
against a brick wall.
“Barbara’s gone back,” he found him-
self repeating. “Gone back to that fellow,
after all!”
And when Leo asked him to stay for the
evening and listen to some new records on
the gramophone he merely gave a curt
refusal and werft out to his horse.
There was a feeling in his mind that
there had been a betrayal somewhere, and
it was none the less acute for being vague
and formless. If Barbara had not definitely
said she had broken with Day, she had
stamped the conviction on his mind by
means other than words. What else could
he infer from the way she had talked about
Niva Downs as her home? Or from the
fact that she never mentioned Day’s name
at all? Looks, gestures, half-finished
phrases, came back to him, all seeming to
point in the one direction* How often had
he received the impression that Barbara
was telling him, in her own way, that she
could never go back to the man she had
married? Telling him that the very idea
of it was unthinkable to her! Was that
just an illusion on his part?
But as he rode through the cool dusk,
ambling along with loose rein, he
steeped himself in the indifference of the
rolling plains about him. What did it
matter? If she had gone back it had been
of her own will, and she was not answerable
to him or anyone else. He was glad he
had not yielded to the wave of passion
that had swept over him when he had held
her in his arms that night by the lagoon.
CHAPTER XVI.
A World of Men.
McCurdie did not come home as quickly
as he had planned. Instead of settling
down for a quiet holiday in a seaside bun-
galow, he had been persuaded to go off
on a motoring tour down the coast, and a
slight accident had damaged the car and
laid Ada up in hospital. It was nothing
serious, he wrote, though the chauffeur had
proved himself an incompetent fool. Ada
had friends in the town, and he himself
was fully occupied in looking at the dairy-
ing country around and studying some ex-
periments that were being made in raising
drought-resisting grasses. They would both
be back again in a month or so.
“But I’m going to sit down after this and
leave everything in your hands,” he added.
“No interference from now on! Tell me
off if I try to put my oar in.”
A dry smile crept round Boyd’s mouth as
he read. The same old story! His father
would repeat it, and even imagine he meant
it, as long as he had anything to do with
the place. Yet he would have to be made
over before he would lie back and watch
other people carrying on. There were not
two ways of tying a rope even while he
was around, and he found it hard to sit
peacefully in a railway-train because some-
one else was driving it.. He could picture
the old man moving around in the little
coastal town in which he was immured,
browbeating doctors and nurses, rooting
the chauffeur out before daylight for a drive
to some place he wanted to see, boasting
to the dairy-farmers about the big-boned
cattle he bred on his own place, and gather-
ing a little crowd around him in the mellow
after-dinner atmosphere of the hotel in
the evening to listen to his racy stories.
As long as he was away Boyd could laugh
tolerantly at this quality of energetic
egoism in the old man, but he was galled
badly enough by actual contact with it.
It was good to be free from it for a while.
Free also from Ada’s probing eyes, and
the little laugh that bubbled from the back
of her throat! He had succeeded in getting
on quite well with her, but there was some-
thing spurious in the banter they exchanged
whenever they met, and he re-acted against
her when he was alone. Ada’s intercourse
with men had always a faint atmosphere
of flirtation about it. She could never
quite forget that she had round arms and
small feet, and that everyone she had ever
met had noticed these things. They tempted
her to wear neglige costumes, sprawl about
in lazy attitudes, and disregard the fact
that she was getting stout. They kept her.
in a man’s world, highly aware of her sex.
And it was this awareness of sex, devoid of
vitality, and lingering past its hour like
a candle burning at daylight, that took
the freshness from the air around her, in
spite of her amiability and genuine light-
ness of heart.
“Yet what a difference a woman makes to
a place—any woman!” thought Boyd, as
he sat over his dinner of an evening, coat-
less and unshaven, his plug of tobacco on
the table beside him.
He was acutely conscious of a subtle
change that had come over himself and
over the whole place in the short time his
father and the two women had been away.
Something had been relaxed, some barrier
let down, so that the primitive world around
seemed to have crept closer, penetrating
the texture of his life more deeply. He
was less aware of meals, the hours on the
clock, the way he dressed. The flow of his
own thoughts went on more unbrokenly
now that he had not to make conversation
with Ada, or to talk with his father about
the day’s work; yet it was less thought than
a sensitiveness to impressions that kept him
rapt as he stood watching Duncan trailing
across the paddock at dawn, or the spaces
between the trees being blotted out at
dusk. Those leagues of mulga imposed a
silence upon a man. He could imagine
surrendering to them till he lost the desire
to talk, and other people’s voices sounded
like a trivial and strident chirring in the
ears. Something that interrupted the deep,
underground current of life!
It was hot. The rains had not come, and
the bare bones of the place thrust them-
selves out aggressively, the dead branches
of the tangled mulga, and the whitish clay
of the cracked ridges. When the evening
meal was over, Larry and Jeff, who had
both returned, came out to lie on the cool
stretch of turf outside the men’s quarters,
that still kept a cover of couch-grass. They,
too, seemed to feel that something had
been relaxed in the world around them.
Lying stretched on their backs, with the
dogs sprawling about them, they talked of
horses, prize-fights, women, or went to sleep
with their pipes still in their fingers. Yet
the strange unrest of the timeless night
kept anyone from sleeping long. The
leaves of the pepperinas rustled on the tin
roofs without any wind to move them.
There was a tang of dust in the air, stimu-
lating in a violent way like the smell of
dried blood to cattle.
McCurdie’s absence had not meant any
easing of pressure in the work. The over-
seer had bought five hundred head of mixed
cattle from Mooney, and the drafting-out.
and branding kept Boyd and the men busy
in the close February heat. A pained lowing
came from the yards, the smell of burnt
hair and hide, a shouting of hoarse voices.
Flames leapt from the hollow box-log,
branding-irons glowed, dogs lying on their
bellies in the dust thrust their heads under
the rails to nip at the passing heels. Stripped
to the waist, Boyd stood on the rails of
the crush, pressing home the burning irons
as quickly as young Jim brought them
from the fire, and he was generally the
last to cease work and throw himself in the
shade when “Smoke-oh” was called and
Josie Duncan came up the track carrying
scones and a'bucket of tea.
“Aren’t you men making a welter of it?”
she asked with a little laugh. “You’ll be
knocking yourselves clean out.”
She was always cool and fresh herself,
though the whole.work of the kitchen had
fallen on her in Miss Carmody’s absence.
It seemed, indeed, that a new vigor had
entered into her now that the housekeeper

The concluding social rally of Race
Week was the Country Women’s Associa-
tion’s ball at the Rex, which gathered in
all the cohorts of squattocracy. Though wool
is down there was plenty of stray cash for
side-line sales of carnival novelties, and a
good cause got the benefit. The Governor
and Lady Comers brought their nephew Lord
Hyde, and stayed long after midnight. The
v.-r. trio entered into the spirit of the party
even to the extent of donning weird head-
coverings. Ninon patterned in black and
apricot pink was worn by her Ex. Mrs.
E. H. Davidson, who was hon. ticket sec.
of the hop, wore fame-colored georgette
that fell in uneven lengths, and the hon. sec.,
Mrs. Russel Grimwade, danced in chiffon of
lapis-lazuli hue. Mrs. Jim Fairbairn, of Mt.
Elephant, and Mrs. Arnold Johnson lent a
hand with the management.
At supper there were cabaret turns,
arranged by Mrs. Harold Clapp, who led a
bunch of players culled from the younger
set. Mary Taylor, as a newsboy, and Ninette
Turck, in the male attire of the Latin Quarter
of Paris, were among the luminaries of this
firmament. Black-and-white artist Stanley
Parker showed unexpected talent as an
impressionist dancer, and Jim Paxton, in
pink ballet skirts and frills, burlesqued Pav-
lova, abetted by lan Heath in Grecian tunic
and wreath of ivy. In a polka competition
Harold Clapp and his partner out-pointed
all-comers. In the throng which occupied two
dancing floors were the Mayor and Mrs.
Luxton, she in floating crimson draperies;
the Mitchell lady, president of the C.W.A.,
in a graceful robe of black embroidered with
ruby-tinted sequins; Dr. and Mrs. Val Mac-
donald, she with midnight-blue glitter upon
a powder-blue frock; Mrs. Simon Fraser, in
white satin; Rear-Admiral Kerr and his
wife; and Mrs. Geoffrey Palmer, whose fawn
georgette gown featured tucks.
Sunshades were a feature of the dress
parade on the lawn at Flemington on the
third day of the autumn meeting. Warm,
bright weather, tempered by a cool breeze,
brought out the sort of clothes that should
grace a seasonable Cup day, and these, with
the outcrop of vividly-hued parasols, gave
the scene a carnival touch. Some of the
brollies were like big flowers. One, all
frills of orange and deep yellow, looked like
a sunflower. A target—or possibly it was
an aeroplane badge—was depicted on
another gamp in circles of shaded amber
bordered with cerise. Another, with a
gaily flowered pattern in silk, had a dangling
mauve fringe, and vivid greens, reds and
blues were flaunted all over the place. The
State vice-regals again had luncheon on the
course, with the Russell Clarkes, Mrs.
Claude Palmer and her daughter and the
Clive Robertsons as guests. Lady Somers
wore floral patterned chiffon in black and
white, with a large mastic straw hat.
Early buyers of winter suits and coats had
the satisfaction of getting in before their
neighbors and setting the fashion on the last
day of the V.R.C. autumn meeting. Clouds
veiled Saturday’s sun at intervals, and the
wind blew keenly, so out came the tweeds.
Nowadays they are made in such a variety of
weights and finishes that the old objection
that they are too heavy for general use in
Australia has been removed. The clothes
providers are making the best of the new
vogue, _ and are even making trim pull-on
hats to match tweed costumes and wraps.
The woollen material figured strongly in
the Flemington dress-parade, exemplified in
coats and skirts, jumper-suits and fur-collared
topcoats. The wearers looked well turned
out and suitably clad. A few fur coats were
given an outing, also some of the latest
face-cloth surtouts, with immense fur collars
and cuffs to the elbows. Again the Gov.
and Lady Somers followed the sport of kings,
her ladyship defying the dropping ther-
mometer in a beige georgette coat and figured
voile-frock, with matching straw hat.
On Australian Cup day the death of the
Earl of Ivintore shut the Federal Government
House pen, and several folk, lost the honor of
partaking of the v.-r. luncheon in conse-
quence. The State Government House en-
closure was fully patronised. Lady Somers
wore a mushroom-grey ballibuntal straw
hat with her checked brown and fawn voile
frock. Lord Hyde, a nephew of his Ex.,
lately arrived from England, was in the
party. Rear-Admiral Kerr was accompanied
by Mrs. Kerr, cool in biscuit georgette and
lace with a shady hat. Mrs. George Black-
wood, in chiffon of black, grey and w r hite,
was close to the throne; also Mrs. Alan
Currie, whose choice ran to gown and mil-
linery of strawberries and cream blend.
Florrie Green’s white chiffon gown was
traced with black embroidery, and her sister,
Mrs. James Purves, wmre a caped ninon
gow 7 n mixing tones of bracken brown and
orange.
For the finals of the Stradbroke Cup the
Harden and Caramut teams which had con-
tested the finals of the Australasian Gold
Cup were the warriors, and again the N.S.W.
team was victorious. Toots from sedans and
limousines encouraged the players, and every
stroke was zealously followed. Lady Somers,
in chiffon of mingled grey and periwinkle
blue, with a baku hat, passed over the cups,
with miniature goblets for all participants,
so the captain found his hands rather full.
The Caramuts, as runners-up, got pewter
cups, and champagne was quaffed from the
cups. With the State Governor and Lady
Somers were their small daughter Elizabeth
and Colonel and Mrs. E. H, Davidson. Frocks
were summery, and sunshades ranged from
the glazed Japanese variety to the small
fringed affairs of good Victoria’s day.
The polo matches were continued on Fri-
day and the final chukkas drew a large
parking of motorists to the Moonee Valley
flat. The State Governor and Lady Somers
were there, she passing over the pewter cups
of victory to the Camperdown team, which
beat Seven Creeks A in the consolation
event. On Saturday morning there was
another gathering at the Valley, this time for
the Cumming Cup match, usually played at
Caramut.
Isabel Handley, pictured here, authoress
of “Handcuffs for One,” the play now being
produced at the Sydney Savoy for the bene-
fit of that city’s unemployed mummers, is a
city council employee. She picked up her
knowledge of stagecraft under Gregan Mc-
Mahon, w 7 ith whom she played juvenile parts
in Ibsen and
Galsworthy,
and Anne in
Shaw’s “Man
a n d Super-
m a n.” She
aft erwards
produced
Olemence
Dane’s “Bill of
Divorceme n t”
and Shaw’s
“Devil’s Dis-
ciple” for the
Repertoria n s.
About five
years ago she
wrote a couple
of one-act
plays which
had a hearten-
ing reception,
and up to date
has had four
long and six
short plays produced. Her first full-length
drama, “The Mandarin Coat,” was staged
by the Repertory Society with unusual suc-
cess. G. B. Post took the play with him to
London, intending to introduce it to West
End Playgoers, but came a cropper with the
first play of his season and decided not to
experiment with his Australian find. How-
ever, the piece earned the praise of the
British Drama League, and its possibilities
are being chewed over at the moment by one
of the. Big Smoke’s theatrical guns. Miss
Handley’s biggest money-maker, “Tlie Six
Miss Seymours,” a farcical three-act comedy,
has a cast of 13 players—only one a man—
and is immensely popular with amdram-
socs of the smaller towns, whose member-
ships are mostly feminine. “Wedding
Belles,” another play on similar lines, has
also proved a good royalty-raiser.
The Government House hop of polo week
struck a heat wave. The dining-room, en-
larged while the Somerses were in England,
was used as a ballroom—Stonington, you
know, is a very small house judged by
English standards. The party, mainly
attended by propagators of wool and beef,
had congregated here for the races and
polo—about 200 of them. Great masses
of zinnias, hydrangeas, asters and other
blooms decorated the drawing-room and
lounge. The G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven
were there, her Ex. having ropes of pearls
coursing upon a gown of black chiffon scat-
tered with rosy poppies. Lady Somers’
draperies, that wandered into a double fish
train, were patterned in cubist designs, with
jew r elled strapping on the bodice and a neck-
let of pearls and emeralds. The Navy bright-
ened up the scene by wearing white mess-
jackets.
Mayor Luxton was there with Mrs. Lux-
ton, who wore black lace. Mrs. Edmund
Thornley, of Terang, was in black fisher
net, with a coat of the same bordered and
collared with smoke-grey fox fur. She, and
Edna Bowes Kelly, in silver brocade, were
about the only wearers of glistening hair
bandeaux. Mrs. C. O. Fairbairn was wrapped
m sapphire velvet, and Mrs. Jim Fairbairn,
of Mt. Elephant, w 7 as in cornflower-blue lace
built with a cape. Mrs. Harry Creswick
w r as in flowered velvet, and Mrs. Oliver
Winter-Irving set off her shingled silver
locks with a black lace robe. Mrs. Norman
Brookes swept a shaded pink feather fan
over a peach-pink chiffon gown. Knight
Sam Hordern brought his niece Nancy,
charming in pink, with whom was blonde.
Betty Willsallen, of Sydney. Phyllis Bray,
of Adelaide, was in royal purple, and Nancy
Greene, from Camperdown, sported ox-blood
chiffon velvet. Many of the younger set put
their faith in white satin—Sandra Shackell
and Patricia Clarke were notable examples.
Valerie Purves blended tulle and grosgrain
silk in her pale green frock. The broad-
acres were represented by the John Mani-
folds, Philip Russells, Hunter Pattersons
and others.
The weather was made to order for the
garden party given by J. G. Latham, leader
of the National party in the Federal House,
and his wife at their Malvern home. The
party was intended as a tribute to the efforts
of Mr. Latham’s electioneering committee
in the Kooyong electorate and other stal-
wart upholders of the Nationalist banner.
About 400 guests wandered over the green
lawns of Flete, and tea was served in a
marquee. The hostess gave greeting in a
frock of figured silk, blending browns and
reds, with a coat of fawn georgette topped by
a mastic-straw hat. Argyle and his lady,
the Edgars, Mr. and Mrs. Claude Couchman,
A. Latham. Mayor of Camberwell, and his
wife and W. T. Lewis, Mayor of Hawthorn,
and his w r ife joined in the rally.
The death of the Earl of Kintore, father of
Lady Stonehaven, caused the dinner and
dance arranged at Federal Government
House for polo and race visitors to be
called off at the eleventh hour. The news
of the passing of this one-time Governor of
South Australia was received too late to
be recorded in the morning papers, so the
guests had very short notice.
Prof. Ernest Scott and his wife—he’s
chairman of the Uni. Professorial Board —
on Thursday night welcomed the latest addi-
tions to the staff of the Uni., and invited
a hundred or so of devotees of the arts and
sciences to assemble at the Lyceum Club to
augment their greeting. Profs. Wood-Jones and
Marshall Allen and their respective better-
halves were the newcomers received into the
fold. Mrs. Scott, in a gown of lobelia-blue
lace with a bodice of moire, shared with
Elise Steele the task of providing musical
entertainment, the violinist being frocked in
golden tints. Chancellor MacFarland, Vice-
Chancellor Monash, Dr. and Mrs. Alex.
Leeper, Prof, and Mrs. A. Gunn and Dr.
Allen Robertson and his wife were there.
Much to the joy of the promoters the weather
was on its best behavior for the market
fair in aid of the Queen Victoria Hospital’s
kitchen furnishing fund. The palm-shaded
Henley lawns made an ideal location. The
Lud Mayor deputised for Lady Stonehaven
(absent owing to the family bereavement),
and launched the enterprise with a well-
deserved compliment to the Q.V.H. and its
workers, a sentiment echoed by J. G. Latham
and W. H. Edgar. The president of the
hospital, Mrs. Norman Brookes, and Mrs.
W. M. Robins, president of the Auxiliary,
held the guiding reins, with J. D. Howie as
lion. sec. Dancers in Grecian tunics stepped
daintily upon the green sward, and there
was a hand. Members of all branches of the
Auxiliary labored in the good cause along
with doctors and nurses of the hospital.
On the 22nd at the Town Hall the Uni.
Symphony Orchestra is putting on a com-
plimentary concert in honor of two of its
members, Gwen and Marjorie Prockter,
who are off to Europe on the 25th
to add to
their know-
ledge. The
daughters of
the E. H.
Prockters of
Cam berwell,
they have been
associated with
their mother,
a pianist of
much ability,
as the Prock-
ter Trio, in
recitals of
Chamber
music. Both
girls have
talents well
above the
average, and
they have
mapped out a
course of
study which
begins with a year in Budapest, where
Marjorie will continue her study of the
fiddle with Jeno Hubay. Later Gwen,
pictured here by Francie Young, will seek
out the great Pablo Casals to get some les-
sons in the ’cello. She is a pupil of Louis
Hattenbach, of the Uni. Con.
W. Beaumont Weston Hearne, son of the
late Colonel W. Weston Hearne, D. 5.0., and
of Mrs Hearne, of Middle Brighton, was
married the other day to Murielle, only
daughter of G. F. Thurgood, of Elsternwick.
Two ’maids, in petal-pink frocks, with leaf-
green hats, provided an effective background
for the white satin and tulle worn by the
bride.
Bell Longland, who became Mrs. Allan
Walton Arnold last week, might have stepped
out of an old picture. Her ivory satin gown
had hand-painted panels of forget-me-nots
and roses, and a rucked chiffon and Brussels
lace train. Sections from her mother’s wed-
ding dress were included in the array. Her
white feather fan was a relic from a great-
aunt, who waved it in the Court of Queen
Victoria. The four bridesmaids provided
the “something blue” in moire of up-to-date
cut with swathed toques of silver lame. Two
trainbearers guarded the bride’s train, their
hair wreathed with forget-me-nots, the hue
of their chiffon frocks.
Limousines and sedans were massed thickly
outside the Alexandra Club on Friday when
Mrs. Edmund Collins, of Frankston, gave a
tea-party as a greeting to her son’s financee,
Mrs. Romilly Farrar, of Perth, and to cele-
brate another betrothal in the family, that
of Mrs. Collins’s daughter Cynthia and
Robert Taylor.
At Arthur Streeton’s show at the Fine
Art Society’s gallery, Lord Somers was an
early visitor, followed later in the day by
the Dowager Viscountess Rhondda and her
travelling companion, Miss Haig. The
Dowager, who had stepped off the Otranto
on her way back to London, had just had
lunch with the Stawell lady, who was her
cicerone. The collection of 36 pictures, in
oils, water-colors and pencil, isi termed by
their author “Landscape with Variations.”
The variations are a nude, flowers and two
designs for fans.
The Athemeum Club has moved to its own
new building in Collins-street, right in the
heart of the doctors’ and dentists’ quarter.
The new premises run to five storeys, and
the facade is just about as plain as could
be devised. The club was founded in 188 S
by James Hay, who also established the
Esplanade Hotel, St. Ivilda, having made a
fortune out of gold in Ileathcote and Rush-
worth in partnership with the late Archibald
Menzies, of Menzies’ Hotel. Originally the
club was intended for members with artistic
and literary tastes, but now is composed of
business men from an upper stratum, race-
horse owners and a few lawyers and doctors.
Some of the foundation members were J. S.
Butters, a Mayor of Melbourne; George
Coppin, David Syme, Fred Row. Richard
Goldsbrough, James Grice, Chas. Bright and
George O. Fenner. Tradition and custom
have been flouted, and in future women will
be admitted within the sacred precincts.
Passing by South Yarra in one of the electric
trains provided by good Mr. Clapp, this
Chatterer lias often speculated concerning
the purpose of a building marked “Try Boys
Society,” which is one of the features of the
landscape. Curiosity has been satisfied by
the advent of an annual report from which
it appears that the society was founded 46
years ago by the late William Mark Forster
to give a guiding hand to boys who needed
it. It is one of the oldest institutions in the
State, and has helped to make many fine
citizens. The South Yarra building is its
headquarters, and embodies a night school
and a gymnasium. Recently Clifden Home
at St. Andrew’s. North was established as a
harbor for needy boys, and is being run on
farm lines. The society’s proteges are not
all lads who have taken a wrong turning.
They include orphans and sons of war
widows and disabled soldiers. Lady Somers
is president of the committee.
A charming bit of staging in the Repertory
performance of “R.U.R.” on Saturday night
was a drawing-room of a few years ahead —
all pale green, with a cathedral-like window
and acute-angled corners, in which setting
gleamed red-lacquered furniture. Alice
Smith, who came here to teach the speaking
of English at the Teachers’ Training Col-
lege, took the role of Helena Glory. She
wore a tweed costume and black felt hat
of sou’-wester cut, with an eye veil, in the,
first act, and in the scene in the greenroom
her tucked chiffon frock matched the walls.
The male Robots were phantom-like figures
in grey who sneaked round in sandshoes.
The female were cut to pattern in neat black
frocks.
Teacup-reading is adding to the attendance
at several local eating-resorts. The revela-
tions are thrown in with a pot of tea and
a slice of cake, and seemingly such soothsay-
ing is within the law. Madame comes along
to each customer, gazes into the dregs at the
bottom of his or her cup, places her hand
upon that of the subject to establish contact,
and unfolds her story. Only pleasant things
are pictured in the tea-leaves. Quick ears
will catch references to “change of residence,”
“increased prosperity” and the like, so every-
one goes home happy. If Madame pro-
nounces a subject to be “psychic” that. is
regarded as a whacking great compliment,
and so the kettle is kept boiling merrily.

THOUSANDS of men and women
have been astonished with the
unusual success of this modern treat-
ment for such uric acid disorders as
backache and rheumatism. Men who
were losing their strength, activity and
power—who were being termed “old-
timers”—have “come back” with such
freshness and vigor as to amaze their
friends; women who were fast losing
their capability and charm have found
a new way to health! Hundreds have recorded their experiences
of this remedy, most of the letters stating that successful results were
promptly obtained where every other form of treatment had failed.
FIND THE CAUSE!
How useless to soothe a symptom and leave the cause untouched!
Yet thousands are doing that—taking old-fashioned kidney pills
and salts—things which merely treat symptoms! But with the new
remedy—Harrison’s Pills—all this is changed. Harrison’s Pills
have shown people they can easily get rid of uric acid aches and
pains, gaining such energy and freshness as they have not known
for years. By getting rid of the deadly uric deposits— as well as
uric acid itself—Harrison’s Pills give HEALTH—reaI health—
promptly, unmistakably and without fail!
GET BACK YOUR YOUTH.
It is a demonstrated fact that of all the remedies offered for uric acid, kidney,
bladder, urinary and rheumatic disorders, not one equals Harrison’s Pills for
giving quick, safe, sure relief, and a definite return to healthy activity. There
is nothing like this remedy for those who feel too old before their time. . . .
Nothing like Harrison’s Pills for bringing back the elastic step of youth!

Sir John and Lady Goodwin attended the
annual meeting of the Musical, Literary and
Self-aid Society for the Blind. The build-
ing fund now stands at £2231, practically
the whole of this having been provided by
the earnings of student members on concert
tours. Mr. W. D. Grimes was re-elected
president.
Mrs. W. Jackson, Hong Kong, entertained
her friends at a Chinese supper-party at
Marlborough Flats. Chinese robes were
worn, the hostess sporting a mandarin coat
over her Chinese Court robe; sister Laura
Smith was in a pink satin coat embossed
in gold. Chopsticks were used for supper,
and various Celestial delicacies were served
in Ming china and red lacquer bowls.
There will be a choral concert and a ball,
the proceeds probably for the Anzac Mem-
orial fund, at the opening of the new City
Hall on April 8. The choir stalls holds
some 200 people, and the dancing floor could
manage a thousand.
At St. Colomb’s, Clayfield, Andrew Dale
married Vivienne Gladys Seal; the bride in
white silk ninon with a Brussels-net veil.
Trixie Seal ’maided in blue and rose floral
taffetas. Atcherley saw the breakfast; Syd-

TJie Rev. Theodore Ivernke was united to
Phyllis Miron Rock in Holy Trinity, Valley,
by the Archbishop of Brisbane. The service
was fully choral. The bride was in white
mariettc and chantilly lace, with a veil of
ivory silk tulle and a Juliette cap. Mabel
Rock, Doris Selwood and Doreen and Enid
Fountain ’maided in dawn pink with Eliza-
bethan caps of silver lace. Daphne Foun-
tain and Una Fountain were trainbearer
and flower-girl. The Carlton saw the recep-
tion. The bridegroom, who has been assist-
ant-clergyman at Holy Trinity, is going to
the Yarra Bank Mission as chaplain.
The Town and Country Women’s new
clubrooms were opened in Union Bank Cham-
bers by Mrs. Harry Cameron, president, with
an informal tea to committee members. They
look out on the river and city. Brown and
gold is the decoration scheme, and the fur-
niture is rattan against a dark-brown dado.
The official opening takes place shortly. The
objects of the club are intellectual as well
as social.
The Warwick ambulance brigade has
donated a site for a baby clinic. Queens-
land’s infant death-rate is claimed to be the
lowest in the Commonwealth, and there are
now 15 clinics in the State with 108,000
attendances. The Government is instituting
a 16th —a travelling one.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Nineteen-thirty will be remembered in
Adelaide as the year of heat records. The
drapers are trying to bring down the tem-
perature by opening shows of winter goods,
and gasping attendants expatiate on the
merits of a fur coat, while “No change m
sight” remains the morning message in the
dailies.
The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Forwood’s daughter Phyllis and Ronald Orr
took place at old St. Andrew’s Churcii,
Walkerville. The humidity was such that
the guests visibly wilted during the rejoic-
ings, a marquee and an incubator being very
much alike in a heat wave, but both the
young people are so popular that their
friends forgave them. Two Barbaras
and two Bettys were the ’maids, and they
made a charming picture in cyclamen georg-
ette behind the dainty little golden-haired
bride in her frock of white silk net. The
bridegroom’s mother came from England to
be present at the wedding. '
There were melting moments at Tattersall’s
Club meeting. Chairman P. J. Flannagan
and his cheery wife dispensed hospitality,
and the liquid refreshment was as welcome
as cooling streams to the panting hart. The
frocking generally ran to ninon over none-
on, but who-could blame them?
“Love Lies” opened to a crowded house
at the Royal. The dressing was smart, but the
temperature made it an ordeal for players
and audience alike. One of the leads had
large wet patches on his knees and shoulder-
blades, while others might have been under
a shower, the way the moisture rolled off
them. The gallery was packed with coatless
men sitting next to more fortunate ladies
in evening dress.
Victor Richardson, the State’s star
cricketer, and his wife were tendered a fare-
well dinner at the Kooyouga Golf Club-
house prior to the departure of the S.A.
captain on the English tour.
The Elder Conservatorium opened for the
year with the usual social gathering. Dr.
Harold Davies gave a brief lecture, after
which a committee of young things took con-
trol, and dancing and a peanut-hunt were
featured.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Sun-browned owners of jumbucks forgot
the low price of wool and made merry
together on Nor’-West Day. There was a
cricket match between the North and the
South, with the usual social accessories.
Frocks were summery, with a predominance
of printed silks. Mrs. J. J. Holmes was
all dove greys; daughter Violet was in blush-
pink liail-spotted net_; chrysanthemums ran
riot over Mrs. Rose’s navy georgette and
Mrs. Oakley’s cigar-brown crepe was orna-
mental with cut-work embellishings. Mrs.
Ted Lukin was all tan and biscuit ; emerald
spots danced upon the black ground of Mrs.
Ilarcourt’s two-piece suit; Mrs. Rodda wore
blue; Mrs. Fred Senior, in Lido-blue chiffons,
brought her handsome sister-in-law, Mrs.
Stretton (Adelaide). Mrs. Lowe’s gown
and millinery were of mignonette green;
Mrs. Guy MacLeod’s pussy-willow ran to
cocoa and tan ; Mrs. Meares was in powder-
blue, and Mrs. Bob Black topped figured
silk with a red hat.
There was a nuptial mass at St. Mary’s
Cathedral before Kathleen Gibbons and
Frank Cawley were made one by Archbishop
Clune. The bridal array was of ivory satin,
with a glitter
of seed-pearls
about the
bodice a n d
the skirt cas-
cading into a
long train. A
sheaf of pink
and white
lilies nestled
in the mesh
of a beauti-
ful' Limerick
lace veil.

Esplanade. Bardwell Clarke photographed
the bride.
Three kindergarten graduates hoisted can-
vas during the same week and embarked
upon the sea of matrimony. In their honor
graduates were bidden to the Training Col-
lege for a progressive bridge party. How-
ever, Lillian Colliss, who had become the
bride of John Higgins, had already started
housekeeping at Mullewa, and Carrie Raynes,
married a few days previously to Dr.
Breidahl, had the misfortune to attract the
influenza wog. This left youthful Allie
Dodge the sole guest of honor, and she was
handed a crystal bowl and sweet-dish as a
wedding-gift. Among the guests were prin-
cipal Gladys Pendred, Athol Clifton, Joan
Good, Jo Fox, Jean Eastwood, Margaret
Graham, Jean Barnes, Edith Ryan, Elsie
Saw, Leila Black, Kathleen Walsh and
Marjorie Birks.
Wedding bells rang out at Cottesloe when
Allie Dodge and Haddy Pearse exchanged
vows at St. Columba’s. The bride’s gown
of white georgette over a sheen of ivory
moire fell in drooping flares; her veil, t a
cobweb of embroidered tulle, foamed from
a bandeau of orange-buds. Leila Black
’maided with a glitter of silver amid her
eau-de-nil georgettes and a pale green picture-
hat. The church was crowded and present
and past pupils of Yoorala Kindergarten
and the primary school formed a guard of
honor and showered the bridal couple with
rose-petals.
Twelve queens are gathering pennies to
swell the returns of Charity Week. There
is to be a monster carnival, a balloon Derby,
a trotting meeting, a Sunday-niglit concert,
processions, and finally the crowning of the
top-of-the-poll lady. Each queen is sponsored
by business firms or Government offices.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Evans lunched a
small party on board the Australia last week.
Among the guests were Professor Mungo
MacCallum and his lady, Mrs. Walter Marks,
son and daughter, the Edwin Websters and
son Donald, Mrs. Palmer (Melbourne), the
Tom Murdochs, Lieut. Letheredge, Com-
mander Chalmers, Captain Darrick and Flag-
Lieut. McDonald. The polished table smiled
beneath a color scheme of tawny beige and
Mediterranean blue in little raffia mats, and
the flowers were massed pink roses.
Miss Isabel D. Travers, newly-appointed
part-time lecturer at the Tas. University,
won the W. R. Giblin scholarship in 1914, and
took her B.A. degree four years later.
Thence she went to Oxford, and graduated
in 1923. Back in Australia after two years’
teaching in N.S.W., she returned to the
Speck, became B.Sc. at the Uni. in 1928,
and now holds the'Research Scholarship for
1929. Miss Travers is camera-shy and incur-
ably modest over her attainments.
Tongues and teacups have clattered at
many farewell tea-parties during the last
month. The Cyril Lewises, the Walter
Gellibrands and Miss Mary Allport are
among those who have left or are about to
leave for a trip across the world.
Fare for all palates and minds was pro-
vided by Mrs. Wordsworth James for half
a hundred guests at the Lyceum Club. As
well as dainty refreshments there were songs
•with both words and music of local manu-
facture, and the efforts submitted for quar-
terly competitions of the Lyceum literary
circle were read by James Counsel. The ver-
satile little hostess recited some of her Own
verses.

was away, a pride of spirit and an energy
of body. Something that had been re-
pressed in her was beginning to assert
itself. Mysterious parcels of drapery
arrived for her with every mail, and the
rattle of her machine could be heard in
the afternoons from her bedroom behind
the kitchen; but later, when she appeared
in some simple, new frock to lay the table,
there were no signs of the labor that had
gone to its creation. She was clever with
her fingers and knew what colors and
materials suited her, so that she never had
the effect of being over-dressed; yet in
that world of men who had become care-
less of appearances, the trim neatness of her
very shoes and stockings had a positive note
that caught the attention.
“I wonder she thinks it worth while,”
Boyd said to himself, seeing her ironing a
fresh frock one afternoon as he passed the
kitchen. “Never sees a strange face from
one week’s end to the other, poor little
beggar! And the old man wouldn’t notice
if she was dressed in a sugar-bag!”
Gradually he found her taking a larger
place in his thoughts, and he could not help
watching her as she brought wood in from
the heap, or came across the passage-way
bearing the dinner-things. Now that the
branding was over, Jeff Thorp and Larry had
gone off to the back of the run to herd a
bunch of weaners and put the outlying
yards in order. The place was deserted
except for the Duncans and Billy Mace,
who had been given a free hand to break
every four-year-old on the run and was
taking his time over the job. There was
a deliberate leisureliness about the half-
caste’s movements. Frequently he dis-
appeared in the direction of the camp and
stayed away for long intervals, leaving the
colts tied up in the hot dust of the yard.
In the kitchen, now that he had wormed
his way in there, he seemed intent on seeing
how far he could prolong the meal-hours,
sitting with his chair tilted back against
the wall, a cigarette in his mouth and his
quick, black eyes following Josie’s move-
ments as she washed up the dishes or
attended to the oven. Over his face
hovered always the same enigmatic smile,
a smile that expressed no pleasure, but
merely the anticipation of it.
So sensitive had Boyd become to the
movements of life around him that every
sound in the kitchen, had meaning for him,
the scraping 'of a chair, the rumble of a
voice, a low laugh. He himself was tied
to the office and the store. There were
casual drovers coming and going, who
wanted beef and flour, or who merely
dropped in to give notice that their cattle
were passing through; but there was
nothing to disturb the quiet intensity of
the place. Sometimes it seemed to Boyd
that his father and Ada were shadowy
figures compared with the people who now
dominated Abemethy. How long was it
since they had gone away? He had almost
forgotten. His mind was filled with images
of Duncan sitting in the saddle-room wiring
hides together for the horse-teams,’of Josie’s
neat legs and polished shoes, of Mace
moving about the yards in a haze of dust.
Was it the presence of Mace that brought
new life to the girl, he wondered? He
could not tell whether she was attracted
to the fellow or not. She abruptly repulsed
any attempts at familiarity on the horse-
breaker’s part, but her eyes followed his
turned back and jaunty figure as he made
his way up to the yard. Was there some
wild blood in her that would make her
surrender to Mace in the end?
“Well, what odds,” he answered himself
cynically, “that’s life! They’re two of a
kind.”
But the very formulation of the reply
outraged something deeper in him than
reason. A flood of dark, obscure passion
was roused in him at the thought of her
giving herself to Mace. No, it was not
true that she and Mace were two of a kind.
There had always been a dancing joyous
quality in Josie as a child, and it still
remained, while at the bottom of Mace’s
nature lay possibilities of sullen cruelty. He
would drag her down. He would even do
it consciously to satisfy the sense of in-
feriority that rankled in his blood, and was
the source of his impudent jauntiness.
Once when he was lounging on the sofa
watching her clear the table, Boyd could
not help questioning her about Mace, and
he was surprised by the hot darkness that
came to her eyes.
“That fellow?” she repeated with a tilt
of her chin. “I can’t stand a bar of him-
never could. His eyes are like a snake s.
You seem to feel them before you hear
him at the door.”
He scrutinised her face closely, wonder-
ing how genuine her outburst was.
“I didn’t think you felt like that about
him,” he said. “I thought you got along
well enough together.”
Josie was silent for a while as she packed
the things together on the tray.
“A girl can’t always show what she feels,”
she said. “I’ve got to be civil. It’s not my
kitchen, and I can’t turn him out when
he comes in for meals.”
There was a note of accusing irony in
her voice, as though she were offended
by the tone of his questioning.
“So that’s the way of it, is it?” he said.
“Well, he won’t be here much longer. I’ll
see to that. Give him the freedom of the
track at the first chance.”
But Mace afforded him no opportunity
of picking an open quarrel. When given
a definite order he always obeyed silently,
his rebellion only showing in his eyes, which
preserved their enigmatic smile. There
was not much chance, either, of putting
the question of authority to a test. Mace
had his own definite job to do, and though
he was spinning it out as long as possible
there was no disputing the fact that he was
doing it thoroughly.
It was not easy for Boyd to forget his
presence, though, To him there was some-
thing sinister and haunting about the long,
lithe figure with its slow movements. When-
ever he went down to the outbuildings
Mace would appear silently from un-
expected places, always with a piece of
leather or a coil of rope in his hand to
prove his occupation.
“Damn the fellow!” muttered Boyd, angry
with his own obsession. “I’m letting the
very way he walks and wears his hat get
on my nerves. I’ll either have to fire him
out or forget about him.”
How completely his thought hM become
centred on the place, he often reflected,
especially now that Barbara had vanished
over the horizon! In that isolation, with
no background of outside happenings to
divert his mind, the human figures around
him loomed increasingly larger and more
distinct against the sky. Even the figure
of Duncan, hobbling about among the hides
in the saddle-room, was invested with a
tragic importance. What magic had his
father exercised over the old trapper that
kept him bound to the place? What
thoughts had been moving through his mind
all these years as he went about his work?
Had he still any rosy dreams about the
future, for himself or his daughter? Josie?
Did he ever think about her at all, or feel
responsible for her? He seemed proud
enough of her in his own way, though they
rarely had much to say to one another.
Sometimes in the afternoons when he was
working about the woodheap and she came
out to bring him a cup of tea, there was
a fumbling awkwardness in the way he
accepted the favor. Almost as though he
were* embarrassed by the knowledge that
this trim girl in the striped Fuji frock was
his daughter! There was no question of
him looking after her in the ordinary way;
warning her against Mace or any other man.
One could as easily imagine the old night-
horse lifting up its voice.
Boyd was lying in the shade of the wind-
mill one hot afternoon with a fine out for
fish, when he saw Josie pass down toward
the lagoon with her towel; but so fully was
he under the spell of a dream that her
figure changed into that of a Syrian girl
going down for water. He was back again
in the desert, riding over the blistering
sands to a white village, the smell of his
sweating horse in his nostrils, a dull crunch-
ing in his ears as his troop ambled behind
him. Figures appeared on the low walls
ahead of him, lean, half-naked children with
staring eyes and shrunken bodies. A couple
of Bedouin horsemen rode out, halting on
a ridge a hundred yards away to his right
and sitting as rigid as statues. Hardly turn-
ing his head, he scanned their hawk-like
faces intensely and rode on in silence.
Cicadas chirred, the loose bark flapped in
the tall gum above him,- a mob of cattle
passed along the -stock-route across the
creek, an incessant lowing heralding their
approach and continuing in a low murmur
after they vanished. In the dry hazy
air, from which color was gone, they looked
like creatures of the imagination, coming
from nowhere in particular and disappear-
ing without leaving a trace. The lean
Bedouin horsemen took up their places
again, riding forward to the brink of the
water and making signs with their hands.
The face of one of them seemed familiar —
the dark eyes, the sallow skin, the faipt
smile masking a secret enmity....
He was roused by a crackling in the
undergrowth a hundred yards down the
lagoon, and rose drowsily to investigate it.
Suddenly his attention was arrested by
the crouching figure of Mace, sitting on his
heels with his hat off, one hand parting the
bushes in front of him. There was an
appalling intensity in that concentrated
gaze, which was fixed on some object further
down the creek; the whole body was as
alert as a bird-hunting cat’s.
He stood for a while gazing at the black,
cropped head that was turned away from
him.
“Well?” he said at last. “What the devil
are you doing here, Mace?”
Mace started up as if he had been stung.
The smile had left his eyes, which were
furtive, and his features had taken on an
hysterical mobility.
“I suppose I can have a drink if I want
to,” he flung out. “Water’s cheap, ain’t it?”
His voice had a sullen impudence in it
and his face was pallid, either from anger
or fear. For a few moments they stood
facing one another in mute exasperation,
as if disturbed by this hostility that had
leapt out from its cover. Then over the
horse-breaker’s shoulder Boyd saw Josie
emerge from the bushes by the crossing, her
wet hair hanging down her back, her stock-
ings in her hand, and her feet thrust into
unlaced sandshoes. A gust of passion swept
over him as he realised the meaning of
Mace’s presence.
“You didn’t want a. drink, you damned
Peeping Tom,” he burst out. “Get out of
this, or I’ll put my fist through you.”
He was astonished at the flood of violence
that had been let loose in him. The blood
had gathered behind his eyes, and his fingers
were itching to meet round Mace’s thin
throat. He stood rooted to the spot while
the horse-breaker disappeared in the direc-
tion of the saddle-room, slinking through
the open door like a rat into a dark hole.
When he went up to the house a little
later Josie was standing under the pepperina
by the kitchen, running her fingers through
her drying hair. She gave a nervous little
laugh as their glances met, but he turned
his eyes away rapidly.
“This has gone too far,” he was think-
ing. “That girl What will Mace say
now if I kick him out? What does she
think about it all?”
CHAPTER XVII.
The Fight.
That evening he knew by the laughter in
the kitchen that Jim had come back and
was having a late meal. The boy’s return
was always followed by an outburst of high
spirits and boisterous humor. His lively
black eyes gleaned the world around him
for whatever was incongruous or absurd,
and when he came home from a ride his
mind bubbled with the results of his obser-
vation. - This would all come out in a
running fire of disjointed talk as he ate
his evening meal, and Josie, sitting on the
other end of the table swinging her feet,
would watch him admiringly, her protests
against his exaggerations sounding out in a
mechanical “Oh, Jim!”
The boy was a continual source of delight
to her. Ever since he had been a toddling
baby she had mothered him, lugging him
about on her hip when he was tired, and
squatting on the ground to amuse him with
colored stones. She mothered him still, but
he never traded on her affection, and was
considerate of her in small things. The
understanding between them was something
more personal than family affection.
From where he was sitting on the ver-
andah Boyd could just glimpse the boy’s
cropped head shining in the yellow light
of the oil-lamp, and catch fragments of his
talk. He wandered across the intervening
strip of garden and looked in at the door.
Josie was sitting at the head of the table
with a half-darned stocking in her hand
while the boy was showing how Larry
Byrne had stood up on his saddle to look
for a galah’s nest in an overhanging limb,
swinging desperately in mid-air when the
horse leapt from beneath him. He laid
down his knife and fork and doubled up
in his chair when he recalled the incident.
Suddenly his eyes rested on Boyd, lean-
ing against ) the door with his pipe in his
mouth, and at once a childish sobriety
covered his face like a mask. Josie, looking
up too, had the same sense of restraint.
“Go on,” urged Boyd. “Tell me all about
it. Any bones broken?”
But the boy’s impish humor had frozen
at its source.
“Nothing but a strained wrist,” he said,
with a shy grin. “He went to market about
the horse, though. It was near an hour
before he could find it, and it had scratched
the kneepads of his new saddle in the
mulga.”
He hesitated for a moment, and then
added with a sense of responsibility:
“They’re just about out of stores.”
“What kind of stores?” Boyd asked him.
“The meat went crook on them. And
they . haven’t any sugar or tea. I could
ride out again first thing in the morning.”
“No,” said Boyd promptly. “I want you
about the place. I’ll send Billy Mace out
with a packhorse at sunrise. He can camp
out there with them for a while, and give
those colts of his a chance of real work.”
For a moment the girl’s flying glance
rested on his face and then fluttered away.
He was disturbed by that quick look,
puzzled by its significance. Could it be
that she found a real oppression in Mace’s
presence? Or was she merely glad to have
Jim back at the homestead again?
“Does she guess what happened this after-
noon?” he asked himself. “And does she
think I want to get rid of Mace because
of her?”
Well, what did it matter what she
thought! He-was perfectly satisfied about
the single-mindedness of his own motives.
Next morning he was up before dawn and
had the packhorse saddled and the rations
measured out before Mace came up from
the saddle-room. Although Jim had given
the horse-breaker his orders, he affected not
to notice what was going on. Seating him-
self on the steps of the butcher’s shop, he
tickled one of the cattle-pups playfully with
a twig, letting his eyes rove occasionally
to the kitchen where Josie was getting the
breakfast. He had a new handkerchief of
green silk knotted round his throat, and
his wet hair was neatly parted.
“I’ve run the horses in,” said Boyd, com-
ing over to him. “Draft out those two
colts you’ve been handling last and take
this packhorse out to the men at the back.
You can stay out there till Jeff and Larry
are ready to take the colts off your hands.”
A frown knitted the horse-breaker’s brows,
and his features became at once heavy and
sullen.
“Taking stores out, is it? That ain’t my
job.”
Boyd’s back stiffened.
“I’m the man to decide that. You’re not
working on contract now; you’re on the
books the same as the others. And your
job’s whatever I tell you to do.”
“That’s news to me,” muttered Mace.
“When the boss left he gave me orders”
“I’m the boss now,” cut in Boyd, “and
I’m not taking any back-talk, Mace. You’ve
been loafing too long.”
He saw the angry blood flush the half-
caste’s neck and face as he stood up, saw
his hand tighten on his whip; but no sound
came from the parted lips. It seemed as
if Mace could not trust his tongue. Boyd
turned to the laden packhorse.
“They’ll all be coming in at the end of
the week,” he said quietly. “Jeff Thorp can
tell you if he wants you to lend a hand
with anything before then. Ask him to rde
over and see whether the dams on the Niva
Downs fence are holding out.”
Mace stood rooted to the spot, hesitating
and undecided. The first flush of passion
had died away, leaving him without any
strong impulse, for such was his nature
that he could only assert his will under
the influence of violent emotion.
“I suppose I can have my cheque when
I come in,” he said sourly.
“Whenever you like,” Boyd replied with
indifference, “but I may as well warn you
that it doesn’t amount to much. You’re
death on cigarettes and confectionery,
Mace, and you’ve piled up a big account

Grey Hair is always taken to be a sign
of age or worry, and in a woman, especi-
ally if she be in early years, amounts to
a tragedy. A woman should never let
herself go. The signs of youth should
always be protected. The well-known

at the store, what with one thing and
another.”
He turned on his heel and went to the
bathroom, plunging his head in the cool
water, as if to brush the horse-breaker’s
defiant face from his mind, and when break-
fast was over he caught his horse and rode
off down the creek. It was absurd, he felt,
that this conflict with Mace should heat
his brain so. He was conscious of some-
thing external to himself, driving him on,
whipping his blood to a feverish intensity.
Yet for years he had been used to giving
orders with a calm decision, and controlling
turbulent spirits through the exercise of
tact and good-humor; so why should he be
uncertain of his own self-command when
dealing with a fellow like Mace? Was it
because he had not been frank with him-
self in recognising the real cause of their
antagonism? Josie?
“Nonsense!” he repeated to himself. “The
girl’s nothing to me.”
And the drumming hoofs beneath him
took up the refrain. The girl was nothing
to him! This little trouble with Mace
would have been bound to crop up, even
if she had ~one off with Miss Carmody.
It was a relief to get away from the close,
intense atmosphere of the homestead for a
while and lose himself on the rolling plains
near the Warra boundary where the grass
looked like hay ripened on the stalk and
reached to his stirrups. He had become too
absorbed in the people around him lately;
had let them blot out the rest of the world.
What a man wanted was perspective, and
he could get that here. A mob of horses
on the far horizon seemed like crows round
a dead bullock, and the boundary-fence
itself was a faint gossamer thread that
vanished and appeared again as the light
shifted.
' At the creek he lay in the sparse shade
and watched two old ducks lead their brood
out through the still, reedy waters of the
reach. The air was soundless and heavy.
Though no cloud flecked the sky, a faint
haze like smoke hung between it and the
earth, robbing it of color and taking the
brightness from the sun. Along the line
of the reach soared a hawk, poising now
and then with spread wings in the dead air,
as if about to drop like a stone. Boyd
lay on his back with closed eyes, almost
forgetting where he was and how long he
had been there.
It was late in the afternoon when he rode
home. The white homestead dozed in its
cool bed of oleanders, and there was hardly
the movement of a fowl or dog about the
place. In a corner of the night-paddock,
where a couple of gums threw a thin shade,
a hollow-backed mare was sleeping peace-
fully, her nose nearly on the ground and
her bushy tail keeping off the flies. Boyd
was taking off his saddle at the little horse-
yard when he saw Josie coming down the
track from the kitchen, a flurried, breath-
less look on her face.
“He’s not gone,” she said when she neared
him.
“Who?” he asked, his hand still holding
the girth. “Mace?”
“Yes,” she told him. “He’s been playing
cards all day up at the camp with that
Indian hawker and some of the old blacks.
They’ve been drinking, most likely. That
hawker always has some sly grog with him.”
She had dropped her voice confidentially,
as if someone might overhear them. Her
dark eyes glowed; there was an intimacy
in the way they met the man’s. It was as
if she took for granted they had been
thinking of nothing else but Mace since the
night before.
“I thought he had something up his
sleeve when he went off,” she said. “He
was letting off at breakfast about being a
horsebreaker, not a wood-and-water joey.”
Boyd quietly buckled the girths again.
“All right. I’ll go over and find out
what’s been keeping him.... Ask Jim to
see what beef there is in the cask, will
you, Josie. We may have to kill again.”
She looked disappointed at the casual
way he took her news. The excitement died
down in her eyes; her body wilted a little.
In truth, Boyd’s instinct had been to hide
from her the impulsive passion that had
welled up in him again. So Mace had
defied him, had he? Well, he would have
,to drive home the fact that he was boss,
even if the lesson had to be marked on
the fellow’s hide! If he did not assert
his authority now he might as well pack
his things together and leave the place.
Under a stunted mulga he saw Mace’s
colt standing tied with a bridle and head-
rope, its nervous, impatient feet stamping
the dry ground to dust, while a little dis-
tance away the other colt and the packliorse
were feeding, hobbled so short that they
could hardly move. The smoke of a fire
drifted through the trees, and there was a
vague, diffused smell of cooking meat.
Round a greasy blanket near one of the
gunyahs a group was sitting over cards—
Mace, the Indian hawker, a few old men
and women.
Mace was the only one who seemed un-
disturbed. After a careless glance over his
shoulder at where Boyd was hanging up his
horse he went on dealing, his body hunched
a little, his long legs crossed in front of
him. There was a pile of small coins and
coppers by his side. He had been winning,
and it gave him confidence; besides, he had
to maintain a bold front before these people
he despised. Boyd strode over, tapping his
switch against his legs.
“Well?” he demanded. “What’s the game,
Mace?”
“Euchre,” responded the horsebreaker
cheekily. “Want a hand?”
“No,” Boyd rapped out. “I want to teach
you how to carry out an order.... Up you
getpMace, you loafing hound!”
It was the switch in his hand that caught
the other’s eyes and held him as if it were
a snake. For a moment he quivered all
over, and then on an impulse he leapt to
his feet and shot forward like a stone from
a sling. The sudden blow on his mouth
knocked Boyd backward and the switch
fell from his hand, but he recovered him-
self and prepared for a second onslaught.

The Sea Gangsters.
My coat is out at elbows,
And, ragged, sick and sore,
The waterfront I’ve haunted
For seven weeks ashore;
But, bound for Acapulco,
I’m signing on once more!
All bound for Acapulco,
Adown the Western Main,
To fetch a load o’ nitrate
An’ leave a load o’ grain,
Two-and-twenty bullies
Are chewing junk again!
Round, men, with a will! Tramp and tramp
it still!
Though you're dry and down and peeved.
Though you're sad and sorely grieved,
Still the anchor must be heaved....
Yo, ho, ho, the anchor's heaved!
When we unreef our topsails
I’ll say my debt is paid,
An’ now no more a-rovin’
I’ll go with you, fair maid.
We’re bound for Acapulco;
Farewell, you fickle jade!
We’ll get no good o’ grievin’
Because our rhino’s done;
Across the windy waters
There’s wages to be won ;
No odds how dark the night is,
To-morrow brings the sun.
Now haul upon the bowline,
My bullies all forlorn;
My silly little black sheep,
By cruel fortune shorn,
And keep your breath for cursing.
Bill steps aboard a-smilin’
All freed from care an’ strife;
’Twas Bill, as you’ll remember,
Got married to a wife
Which proved a howlin’ tartar,
An’ plagued ’is long-shore life.
Now Bill is settin’ for’ard
An’ mendin’ of ’is clo’es,
As ’appy as a mudlark
Because the beggar knows
He’s left ’em both behind him,
The woman an’ ’is woes.
A true English sailor, just come from Hong
Kong,
His stay in old England it didn’t last long.

brown,
We'll blow the man up and we'll blow the

Singing Tibby heigh-ho!
There’s Taffy out of Cardiff —
’ls father sells small coal—
A-heavin’ of ’is heart up
With every Weedin’ roll;
He’ll larn to .be a sailor,
Gor bless your silly soul!
He spent liis mother’s money
On wimmen, cards an’ wine;
The bos’n’s tried to cure ’im
With arf a pint o’ brine;
’Tis good for Taffy’s innards,
But not for yours or mine!
He’s just come down from the wild-goose
nation,
He left his love on a big plantation,
And sing hi-10, my Ranzo, hey!
At the lubber’s hole he baulks an’ blubbers,
For that’s the way of these pore land-lubbers.
So sing hi-10, my Ranzo, hey!
With Shoreditch Sam an’ Sandy,
Big Jake an’ Orkney Joe,
An’ Bruiser Ben of Lime’us’,
An’ Pansy from the Row,
He’ll bunk an’ feed an’ labor,
Whichever winds may blow.
They’ll brawl an’ bite together
Six months across the seas,
In frowsy, frayed pea-jackets
An’ greasy dungarees,
Tweed caps an’ slippy sea-boots
An’ scanty rest or ease.
Oh, Cardiff is a fine town, with ships in the
bay,
And he'll wish with his heart he was only
there to-day;
He’ll wish with his heart that he was far
away from here,
A-sitting in his parlor amd courtin' of his
dear.
But we calls for the watches,
An’ we sings as we goes
Of the mate’s funny whiskers
An’ the cook’s crooked nose,
An’ the Old Man’s relations—
Which there’s none of us knows.
Whatever wind is Wowin’,
No odds what work we do,
We always find a chanty
Will help us get it through.
An’ that’s the ruddy reason
I’ve sung this song to you.
All bold British sailors, the Salt o’ the Sea,
Big Jake an’ the bruiser, the bos’n an’ me,
With old Reuben Ranzo, we’re off and away —
We’ve shook out our topsails, my lads, so
belay!

Gunness
IS GOOD FOR YOU
No. 1
FOR
STRENGTH
Guinness builds
strong muscles
for sport —strong
nerves for those
under physical
strain. Famous
doctors say that
it is very valuable in cases of mental
or physical exhaustion.
The best proof is the test you make
for yourself. As you drink a glass of
Guinness you feel better at once —
you feel that it is putting strength
into you.
Try a Guinness every day with
your dinner. There can be no more
pleasant way of improving appetite,
digestion and general fitness.

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This Page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the
gems in picture, story and verse published in “The Bulletin of last
century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
a new generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
The Sydney lady undertaker, we are glad
to learn, is still in full blast and prospering.
She has already buried two husbands, and
is still prepared to take the measure of a
deceased at the shortest notice. This enter-
prising female also runs a fruit-shop, and
with unconscious humor she advertises her
corpse-planting business on the paper fruit-
bags. Consequently the customer who car-
ries home a packet of unripe bananas at
midnight, and sits up to devour his pur-
chase, is apt to get a sudden shock that
makes him grow stiff, and then after reading
the gruesome “ad.” two or three times over
he tries to recollect whether the fruit was
handed to him out of a coffin, and whether
these strawberries and the accompanying
cream were dished up in a skull or a saucer.
On reciprocal principles this lady would no
doubt make the undertaking business adver-
tise the fruit establishment if that were pos-
sible, but unhappily not even the cheapest
funerals are performed on the paper-bag
basis, and public prejudice makes it inad;
visable to send round a Chinaman to sell
oranges from a hearse.
The Ten Commandments reduced to one —
Don’t do it.
A small girl had been very naughty, so
her mamma sent her into the next room to
pray that she, might become a better child.
Soon the piping supplication rose quavering
on the breeze: “Please, Dod, I’ve bin a vewy
notty child, and I want you to make me a
dood child. Please, Dod, make me a dood
child, an’ if at first you don’t succeed try,
try, try again!”
“Mosquitoes! What do ye know about
mosquitoes?” said Big Sam. “If ye had
been with me and Jimmie Junkaway on the
Belyando about 12
year ago, ye might
speak about mos-
quitoes. We was
camped near the
big waterholes be-
low St. Anne’s, and
Jim went in bogey-
ing and got took
with a cramp in
th.e stummick or
something, an d
went under. Well,
he had touched
mud twice, and
come up for the
third time of ask-
ing, to let a yell
out of him, or take
a look at the scen-
ery, when a buck
mosquity (reg’lar
old warrior) that
was roosting on a
branch just over
him dug his per-
boscis into his arm
and held on, too,
till I come up and
rescooed him. .Tim
was pretty well
played out by that
time, though. The
mosquity must
have kept his
spear-pump going
pretty active, and
Jim was sucked as
dry as the dottle of
a clay pipe, and
didn’t weigh more
nor two dry lamb-
skins. As soon as
the mosquity seen
that I had a good
hold of Jim by the
wool he pulled his
nose out of his
arm, and set sail
down the lagoon.
He must have
passed somewhere
in the neighborhood of our camp, for when we
got back to the waggons young Tommy Off-
side told us that a big fat native-companion
had flew over just afore, a-singing a new
song like a hallelujah army.” And Big Sam
again wrapped himself in the stately folds
of his Cofidaminer, and soon started a rich
baritone snore, strong enough to shake a
flying squirrel off a gum-tree.
“Scabby” Moffat, a well-known squatter of
a bygone age, having built a palace befitting
a wool-king at his Hopkins Hill (Vic.) pro-
perty, offered the use of the establishment
to the Duke of Edinburgh on the occasion
of that canny personage’s first visit to Vic-
toria. Moffat was a bachelor, and earned
his unsavory cognomen from the fact that
his was one of the first (if not the first) runs
in the colony infected with scab, which fact
he carefully concealed. This led to a well-
remembered piece of election doggerel:—
Scabby is his name
And scabby is his pocket,
Scabby is the man
Who votes for Scabby Moffat.
The magnificent house which he built has
an entrance hall in which it is said a team
of 10 bullocks, dray and all, can be turned.
While awaiting the acceptance by the Duke
of his offer, Moffat walked into the book-
store of James .Caples in Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, and, intimating that he had one
room set apart as a library; —by the way, he
could neither read nor write —proceeded to
give an order for books. Old Caples, know-
ing he had a wealthy man in front of him,
after a profuse use of the. snuffbox, made in-
quiries as to authors, bindings, etc., etc. But
Moffat did not wish to be .
pestered with any such
paltry details; he gave a
general order, very concise,
but which suited Caples to
a T. “Send two ton or
thereabouts, and post the
bill to the club.” Moffat
died shortly afterwards at
Point dc Galle on his return
from England, never enjoy-
ing the new house or the
“two ton.”
Those Sydney mammas
who dress their young daugh-
ters from head to heel in
shimmering satin, glittering
passementerie and ostrich
tips may learn with advan-
tage to themselves that two
summer dresses worn by the
Princess Victoria and Maud
of Wales were simply as fol-
lows: Of grey, with a fine
thread-line check, the bodices
made in points which are
laced up at the neck with
grey cord and left open at
the. waist to show a tight-
fitting tan cloth waistcoat.
And what guys a lot of the
Sydney mothers do make of
their girls ! The other day
(“Sappho Smith” wrote in
the Woman’s Letter) I saw
a fat millionairess in flaring
claret brocade, scarlet bon-
net and tan boots, “carting”
along her three daughters
(all under 15) and all
attired in short peacock-blue
velvet dresses, with colossal
improvers, which they
waggled atrociously. Girl-
ish simplicity! They don’t
know what it means.
The ordinary frog-hyper-
bolater is having a rest now,
but the great snake-liar
seems to be in full blast.
Down south a reptile
crewled under a sitting duck,
and after swallowing the 18
eggs which the patient bird
was hatching it hung itself
round the neck of the wrong-
ed quacker and waited re-
suits. It was killed
shortly afterwards, and, its carcase being
opened, the eggs were taken out and
hatched in the usual course, but each
duckling had a mark like a snake
on its head. We may add that the sea-
serpent recently came ashore on a coral
island in the South Pacific and ate four
shipwrecked sailors, taking one each night.
It was 75 feet long, and in the fight which
attended its last visit it threw several men
a dozen yards in the air. Its bite was
venomous, and everybody who was touched
with its teeth in the scrimmage was slewed
—we mean slain.
Never write to your wife. Your spelling
and handwriting may one day be flippantly
criticised by her second husband.
We always feel sorry for the bailiff, the
saddest and worst-banged man in the com-
munity. Nobody loves him, and everybody
claws at him and aims hot water at his
head. Those whom the gods love die young,
and so does the bailiff; but the gods have
nothing to do with him —it’s the other
fellow. He gets bald early, for women who
are behind with their rent reach for his
hair, and regularly every Monday morning
he gets his ear shifted. Then on Tuesday
he generally gets it shifted back again, and
it seldom remains two days in the same
place. Furniture rushes at him on the
smallest provocation; so do farming imple-
ments and livestock, and cooking utensils
fall on him from a great height. People are
always inventing new troubles for the bailiff,
too, and this brings us at last to what we
wanted to say all along. The very latest is
that the other day two of the children of
misfortune went to reason with a farmer
who was very deep in debt, and when he
saw them coming he hid himself, and left
his wife to talk to them. Accordingly, the
lady locked the door and remarked suavely
from the window: “Good marnin’ to yez. It's
the master yez want to see, I don’t doubt
now. Well, wait a bit in the yard and
Oi’ll sind him to yez.” And with that she
went out to the barn and shoo’d the bull
round the house, and that excited animal
came along with a roar and scattered the
bailiffs in the shadow of a wink.
It is proposed to start a Press Club in
Sydney. They had one in Melbourne which
met in rooms located on the same landing
as a corset-maker's. The result was that
exasperated ladies frequently rushed into the
press-room and bullied Briggs, an “Age”
luminary, about a pair of stays “which you
know perfectly well should have been sent
Old gentleman who has taken a short cut to be in
time for his last tram.
home quite a week ago. You promised them
last Wednesday evening before ten.” The
club died of selling too much liquor for
sixpence.
Girls! only think. At a recent Sydney
wedding the bride walked over a mat
stretched from the gate to the church door,
fashioned of evergreens and filled in with
lilies, chrysanthemums and violets. Vanitas
vanitatum! A few moons more and the
same lady will be hanging herself over the
back-yard balcony barneying with a slant-
eyed Mongolian sinner over the price of
a head of cabbage.
“Land was sold for £BOO per foot in Mel-
bourne the other day.” And yet there are
people who, if they got a portion of it in
their soup, would strongly object.
THE WRECK OF THE DERRY CASTLE.
(In publishing the subjoined verses we take plea-
sure in stating that the writer thereof is a boy of
17 years, a young Australian, who has as yet had
an imperfect education and is earning his living
under some difficulties as a house-painter—a youtli
whose poetic genius here speaks eloquently for
itself.—Ed. B.)
Days of ending for beginnings,
Ocean hath another innings,
Ocean hath another score!
And the surges sing liis winnings,
And the surges shout his winnings,
And the surges shriek his winnings
All along the sodden shore!
Sing another dirge in wailing
For another vessel sailing
With the shadow-ships at sea !
Shadow-ships for ever sinking—
Shadow-ships whose pumps are clinking,
And whose thirsty holds are drinking
Pledges to Eternity.
Pray for souls of ghastly, sodden
Corses, floating round untrodden
Cliffs, where nought but seadrift strays;
Souls of dead men in whose faces
Of humanity no trace is—
Not a mark to show their races—- ,
Floating round for days and days.
Ocean’s salty tongues are licking
Round the faces of the drowned,
And a cruel blade seems sticking
Through my heart and turning round.
WHY SHE WANTED THE WIRE.
“At Cape York (Queensland), the blacks are pulling down the telegraph
wires.” —Daily paper.
Heaven! Shall his ghastly, sodden
Corse float round for days and day a ;
Shall it dash ’neath cliffs untrodden,
Bocks where nought but seadrift strays?
God in Heaven, hide the floating,
Falling, rising face from me!
God in Heaven, stay the gloating,
Mocking singing of the sea!
HENRY LAWSON.
WHY THEY WILL NOT MARRY.
Leisurely after lie opens his eyes
The bachelor chooses his time to rise,
Leisurely dressing, he knows no cares—
Breakfast is waiting for him downstairs
Thrust out of bed in the cold bleak morn,
With his hair unkempt and beard unshorn,
The husband creeps to the kitchen stove.
“Wish I was single again, by Jove!”
This is the reason young men won’t wed:
Each sex is equally fond of bed,.
And lie, of course, is a brute who’ll desire
His wife to get up and go light the fire.
Never speak evil of any woman. You
never know whom you may one day have
to marry.

S.S. SEVERN
TELLS HOW JOHN PENTACOST MARRIED THE ORIKIVA
WOMAN AND WHAT UBIPI, THE KIWAI BOSS-BOY DID ABOUT IT.
A FTER the hell of a hot day, as John
/\ Pentaeost, tired out, trod heavily on
/V the to p step of the grass plantation-
hut, his foot broke through the wet-rotted
sapling and twisted under him. Xt was
imperative that he get the carriers loaded up
and away with his copra by daylight, or
he’d miss the Morinda, which pushed rff on
the stroke of midday. And he with a
twisted ankle! IXell-everything!
On the third day his foot went black, and
he lay in a semi-stupor; whereupon Uripi,
the Kiwai boss-boy, took it upon himself to
paddle up river to the camp hospital on the
Laloki to fetch the Sister to attend his
taubada.
Through a haze of pain and fever John
remembered her. She was. the girl he had
seen sitting under a poinsiana-tree with a
lap full of orchids as he rode past the camp
one sunset. Orchids and a nurse’s cap didn l
click so he had re-christened her as he rode
away. He named her the Fairy Princess.
There were so few young white girls in
Papua that one made allowances to oneself
for going a bit romantic. Though, to be
frank, he, like most of the other planters,
had not taken kindly to the idea of a white
woman having charge of a hospital for sick
“boys” suffering from a flux which always
follows on the opening up of new ground.
Native labor was too damned expensive to
fool with; it needed ! a man in charge of it,
everyone knew that. Still the death-rate was
small, and there had so far been no com-
plaints.
Sister remembered him, the handsomest
man in Papua, with his prematurely grey
hair, riding by on a grey horse. Sort of
prince.
No, he wouldn’t go into Port to hospital;
Uripi knew nothing about tobacco-planting
—the new venture. Here he’d stay. So she
fixed up his foot, and showed Auda, the
cooky-boy, how to apply the lotion until her
return next flay. Then she made John a cup
of tea with tinned milk in it —how he hated
tinned milk! —and left.
On the whole, he took a dislike to her;
she seemed bossy, though she scarcely spoke.
Down river she came next evening bringing
a cake freshly baked, a basket of limes for
his tea and a new book. After all, she
seemed kind, and her blue eyes smiled. John
knew a girl in Scotland with blue eyes.
“Why don’t you marry, or get your sister
to come out to look after you?” she said in
her forthright way a week later, looking
round the unkempt living-room and the drips
in the grass roof where the rain—that soft,
warm, daily drop-dropping tropic rain—came
through.
“I wouldn’t ask any girl to come to this
heat and wet-rot and interminable bulama-
kau,” he answered.
“If she cared for you she’d come. Any-
how, why don’t you keep a shooting boy
to get you fresh meat, and set your cooky
planting beans and tomatoes? —anything
would grow here.”
“I never thought of it,” he acknowledged.
“As a matter of fact, I have been too busy
to bother about myself. One has to make
good, even in Papua.” .
This she agreed to: as a rule she didn t
agree with him. “Your foot is on the high
road now,” she announced; “I won’t be down
again for a few days. Ba mahuta.”
He wished that she didn’t wear that kind
of hat; it looked — sensible. Missionary, lhe
white muslin cap seemed more faery—like
blue eyes.
* * # *
Simbiri, the Orikiva woman of fifteen or
thereabout, who had been permitted by the
parental Government to accompany her uncle
and his wife, her only relatives, when be,
Kisisi, the uncle, with a batch of new
Kerava boys, signed on to work for a twelve-
month on John Pentacost’s plantation, was
black as an illimo cooking-pot, save for
her eyes, which glowed a sort of mossy-green
like mangrove smoke, and were slightly slant-
ing. Her hair was dressed in hundreds of
tiny dags, each ending in'a rose-red shell on
a level with her chin. She had thin, long
legs and a wide, ingenuous smile which, some-
how, belied her trick of the side-long glance.
She talked in a plaintive.sing-song.
When her aunt, whom she hated because
of beatings, came over from the compound to
wash Pentacost’s shirts by order of Uripi,
Simbiri followed, and sat on the cook-house
steps and sang to herself. “La liril la” she
sang over and over again. And when the
sun, copper-red, began to drop, she sauntered
out to the edge of the jungle and gathered
blossoms from the frangipanni and set them
in a jam-tin on Pentacost’s table.
Auda, the cooky-boy, grinned and threw
them out.
After a night of intense heat, Pentaeost,
still shackled by his foot, waked one dawn,
cool and refreshed from an hour’s deep sleep,
to find the girl Simbiri standing at the head
of his stretcher fanning him with a green
palm-leaf. It was jolly nice of her. And he
liked her sweet shy manner. She told him
in her plaintive little sing-song about her
aunt beating her. He would see to that.
Put a stop to it. Poor little kid!
Sister came in one blazing hot day to say
that she was returning to Port, and probably
to Sydney. A terrible thing had happened—
all the sick men in hospital had run away.
Someone—Tarua, the head-orderly, said it
was a vati tana fdevill —sat on the hillside
overlooking the hospital and sang all night a
weird, wailing sort of dirge-thing that sounded
like “White-woman medicine no good. Too
many men die. Too many men die.” And
unless they ran away from it none of them
would return to their villages and their
wives and little ones. Tarua didn’t really
understand vati tana talk (the Government
being very strict about magics), but it
sounded like that. And when be went, down
to the hospital to give the sick their early
morning medicine, there were none there to
give it to. Even the night-walkabout
[orderly] had gone.
It was all very worrying, for native labor
costs twenty-five pounds a head and must be
returned to its own village. Sister thought
she had been kind to them ; she had never bad
any trouble with the natives before, on the
Lakekamu or elsewhere. But there it was.
Mr. Pentacost must keep on resting his toot.
And be sure to get someone to keep house tor
him. And good-bye.
Later in the day Mr. Assistant Resident-
Magistrate Keeling came out with his Armed
Constabulary to see about it. He’d thank
Colonel Pentacost for a cup of tea and a bit
of a spell before moving on. -
Into the jungle he and his posse of police
went for a week; on their return he told the
Colonel that ten only of the fifty who bolted
had been found, and they were half-dead
from starvation. Too weak to swim across
the river higher up—that was how he had
got them. The rest were dead of dysentery
through eating green wai wai or something.
One of the poor blighters had said something
to the corporal about an Orikiva woman
inciting them to bolt back to their villages.
But there was no proof of it, for the rest of
them just muttered about a vati tuna. There
was not a single Ordinance to deal with it.
He was sorry for the Sister, a jolly fine girl,
Royal Red Cross and all that, and he hoped
it wouldn’t do her any harm. _ Perhaps she
was a bit strong on the medicine —natives
are a bit shy of it. Another cup of tea,
thanks. A good idea of the Colonel’s not to
keep much whisky about; safer —a man can’t
drink what he hasn’t got. Who was that
girl outside the cook-house? Clear her out.
Gaile girls make the best housekeepers. Well,
so long, he must be off.
And Mr. Assistant Resident-Magistrate
Keeling started out on his twelve-mile tramp
to Port.
S’! :!= # *
Pentacost discussed the matter with Uripi,
who had got an idea into his silly old head
that the Orikiva woman who had done the
mischief was Simbiri. Little Simbiri. Rot!
No doubt the Sister ivas strong on medicine.
Anyhow, Uripi hated Simbiri: they both
were black. He from the west, she from the
east, the peoples of other divisions of the
Possession being colored from pale gold to
brown. In Papua, as elsewhere, east _is
east and west is west, the result being
hate. Uripi hated her: she savvied too much.
That was all he had against her. It was all
he could have.
The Sister had gone. And Simbiri, smiling
her artless smile, inquired: “Whatfor the
white woman no more come looksee your
leg?” Pentacost missed Sister, she was some-
one to talk to, to argue with. These damned
niggers always said what they thought one
wanted them to. She made good cakes, too.
And had blue eyes, clear, with long lashes.
Whereupon the gecko in the grass roof
gleeked at him.
The evening after his first day out m the
plantation fever took him, the worst he had
ever had. Auda made him a bath in a wash-
ing tub and helped him off the floor, where
lie lay for coolness, and set him in it, sarong
and all.
As Pentacost squatted there, confined, a
tiger-snake came out from under the tappa
mat he had been lying on, and, rearing its
evil head over the edge of the tub, stared him
in the face within six inches of it. Too dazed
with fever to move, which undoubtedly saved
his life, Pentacost sat for time that seemed
interminable till the snake unreared itself and
slowly slid away. As it reached the open
doorway, Auda came in and, seeing it, struck
at it with a machete. It disappeared through
the saplings of the floor. “Kill it,” said
Pentacost and collapsed. Later Auda and
the offsiders brought him in a snake to
prove that it was dead. But he knew. Theirs
was a black snake, and his was a, tiger. It
would return. His ankle was better by now,
and he could get about a bit,. but was
rottenly alone. Snakes too. Getting nervy,
was he?
About then the Orikiva woman took up
her residence in his house. He needed some-
one to keep house for him. She was company
..with orchids in her hair. When he
came in tired she had a cool drink ready.
She sang to him little plaintive songs of
bird-folk and singing-fish; and in the cool
of evening she danced for him under the
frangipannis.
Gradually she usurped him. He gave up
going into Port for tennis and golf on
Sundays, and began to shun his kind. The
nice white women in town were sorry. They i
all liked him —some loved him. Who wouldn't
be sorry when it was John Pentacost. |
Colonel and D-S.O. before he was thirty, and j
six feet in his socks, with real people at
home? .
When John came face to face with them m
the street of Moresby they seemed distrait.
Anyhow, they were a poor lot, mostly tired
or bored: some had grievances. He began to
resent them. And to drink. Simbiri laughed
so merrily when he lurched: it was a
pleasure to hear a real laugh. And if she
would keep on singing that silly “La liril
la,” and did steal a bit and lie a bit, it
was because she knew no better. He must
make allowances for her. (White men do
this for black women. It is black magic.)
He had heard that the Sister had left
Port, gone south, engaged to Marriot, that
ass, and was coming back after the Wet to
marry him.
Whereupon the gecko in the roof tut-
tutted at him.... And so for six moons.
Then it fell upon him that he needed his
kind— folk to talk to. to argue with. The
men in Port were all right, some of them.
So he went into Ryan’s hotel and stayed
a week, drinking. Some drunken fool the
day after his arrival had spoken of Sinclair
as a “combo”—rotten word: it rankled.
But drink drowned it: drink drowned any-
thing.
All artless smiles and fresh striped ramis,
with red sapi-sapi bunched behind each ear
and orchids in her hair, the Orikiva awaited

him. ( She was glad to see him if no one
else was.) She set out the whisky and spark-
lets, then sat back on her heels.
“Missionary bin come,” she smilingly
announced. “Him speak must married.”
“Hell! Was that it? Those fool ordi-
nances that compel a white man to legally
marry the native woman who keeps house for
him and won’t allow him to divorce her no
matter how flagrant her delinquencies, the
plea being that it would be so easy for the
clever white man who wanted to get rid of
her to throw temptation in her way ! They
ought to be burnt by the hangman! So that
was it? What was a man to do? If he
refused to marry her the missionary would
make mischief between him and the Govern-
ment. And where would he be without
labor? And in his heart he knew that he
feared the Orikiva —that it was she who had
driven the sick men from the hospital to get
the Sister away. And if he refused to
marry, that she would get even with him
somehow; most likely by driving his boys
away. And where would he be then with a
plantation laborless on his hands and the
tobacco ripe for picking? He had got next
to nothing for his copra. ... And, anyway, he
could escape if ever he wanted to, through
Dutch New Guinea —if he had the money.
So let them marry him, these damned wow-
sers ! Let them!
He took her across to the Mission, and the
padre, who meant well by the heathen—in
their blindness as he called it —united them
in holy matrimony. John Pentacost, Colonel,
to Simbiri Orikiva.
Uripi’s hatred of her increased. If it was
a native woman his taubada wanted to
keep house for him, why had he not bought
a Gaile girl, one of those young ones with
gold in her skin and proper New Guinea
girl’s hair, combed up till it stood out like a
lime-bleached balloon, not dags ending in
shells, that outlandish fashion? And with
prettily rounded legs, not stilts? An Orikiva
from a mud-swamp for married wife! A
vati tana ! And black! He spat vociferously.
As married wife the Orikiva took up her
permanent location on the cool corner of the
verandah with one small boy to fan her and
a second to fetch and carry—sat and sang
her interminable “La liril la” and chewed her
interminable betel.
Greedy she had always been, eating every-
thing she could lay hands on. Now she
grew cheeky. And lice bred in her hair.
On Pentacost’s return from a business call
on another planter higher up the river be
found that his wife had been to Port, taking
her relatives with her, and had run up a
bill for fifty pounds for beads and finery
at the store. He paid without question, it
being one of the black magics that a native
wife may spend unlimited sums on herself
without question. He did remonstrate, just
a little. And next morning when Uripi and
the boys went to hoe the young tobacco
plants on the river patch there were none
there. And no tracks; the soft warm tropic
rain had obliterated them. Another vati
tana. And still “La liril la.”
The native now had John Pentacost com-
pletely in her coils. She laughed when he
was downhearted, and he laughed too. She
began to look silly. “Too many betel,” he
reproved; “I no like.” “I like,” she tittered,
and the red juice ran down her chin. Silly
kid! And men, cheap whites whom he
previously had scarcely known, began to
come out to the plantation. They drank up
his whisky and called him Jack. It jarred.
But Simbiri was fond of him. What else
counted ?
Later he had to go down river about some
seedlings, and, returning unexpectedly by
moonlight, he fancied he heard a faint bird-
like whistle from the scrub and a rustle in
the high dried grass near the steps. An
ow] probably.
Simbiri was asleep curled up in his bed.
Then came old Uripi into it. Out on the
plantation lie stood before Pentacost and
cleared his throat.
“Well?” said John.
“Taubada,” said he, “you no killum me
suppose I talk you true.”
“No.”
“You no tellum Simbiri; I fright along
her.”
“No.”
“That one Kerava boy Potesi he all same
married along her.”
Potesi! That scaly black pig all covered
with double-skin, sharing his wife!
Simbiri—she knew no better! But he
went out after Potesi, who got wind of it
and made away across the river, leaving the
canoe on the other side. Even the mad
white man wouldn’t dare the alligators by
sM'imming it.
Returned from his missed man-hunt, Penta-
cost sat him down on the steps of his hut
and took stock of himself. Work. Sweat.
Fever. Niggers. This! Hell!
His wife, still smiling, lounged on the
cool corner of the verandah. Was she not
married and always would be? Missionary
had said so.
Uripi, who loved his master, considered the
matter carefully. John Taubada would
assuredly shoot Potesi and put himself in
gaol for the rest of his life—for this woman-
thing! This drab! It called for delicate
handling. Disarmament must be his policy.
He would get that armsliell that Waidoi,
the pourri-pourri man, had spoken of when
Uripi s brother lay dying and died because he
hadn’t the five pounds to buy it from Juboise,
the trader, and present him wii it. Yes.
He would buy that armsliell for W idoi, and
in return would demand a strong pourri-
pourri, strong enough for an Orikiva. And
in the meanwhile——
He began to be kind to Simbiri, bfought
her betel, and a euscus tail for a fly-switch
Come Sunday, anid Pentacost sleeping-
drunk after a wet night with Sinclair and
some others. Uripi, with red hibiscus in
his hair and a blue striped rami, sauntered
along to the quarters and squatted on the
top step by the cool corner of the verandah
tumming his silly jew’s-liarp. (The Orikiva
smiled.) Leisurely he rolled a tobacco-leaf
and inserted it in his bau-bau, lighted it and
took a deep drau'; handed it to Simbiri,
who took a deeper one, regarding him from
the slant of her cool green eye.
“Flenty little fish sit down along river,”
Uripi began as though passing the time of
day. “More better you go catch him along
net. Taubada him too much like fish alone-
kai-kai.”
Simbiri sniffed. What matter whether
taubada liked or liked not? Was she not
married?
“I been talk along Potesi,” continued
Uripi. (Now sh e was all heed.) “Him no
S°t kai-kai. Him too many hungarary. More
better you go catch fish make him kai-kai.
Flenty fish sit down along nepa palms. I
f°. talk Potesi.” (Here indeed was a
triend!)
. Hi the half-dark before dawn she, with her
fisp-trap, a thing of woven fibre the size of a
child’s butterfly net slung over her shoulder,
slipped like a shadow down the jungle track
to the river.
As she leant over the stream to draw in
ber trap filled to its brim with tiny glistening
bsb, Uripi crept up behind and, seizing her
round the arms, filled her mouth with mud.
Then tying her hands and feet together with
a string of Goaribari hair—a puissant pourri-
Pourri this and well worth a five-pound arm-
shell to Waidoi—and attaching them to a
great stone, he flung her out into the river,
With a log and his hands he made the
imprint of an alligator in the mud of the
bank.
Undoubtedly as the Orikiva woman was
fishing in the early dawn an alligator had
come up out of the river and taken her.
For when Mr. Keeling .and his constabu-
lary arrived from Port to investigate, there
we U®, spoors still plainly to be seen,
Which ended it.
Confessio
Three things and one
Are dear to me:
The sinking sun ;
The leafless tree;
A Spanish air
Remembered well:
Thy face so fair
But false as Hell.
,
The sunset gold,
From cloister seen,
Brings from of old
What-Might-Have-
Been;
The leafless bough,
Those deeds that
fall
Unnoticed now—
Yet Part-of-All.
The tune from Spain
Recalls a past
Of joy and pain
Too rich to last;
That fair, false face
(These years agone)
Makes my disgrace
Oblivion.

The Carpet.
A myriad tints combine
And cunningly intertwine
In a woven filigree
Till there comes again to me
As a .sunny anodyne,
Like a flask of topaz wine,
The light on an eastern sea.
I know not when you were made,
Nor what deft hand arrayed
Your color harmony
To chime so craftily
With the warm grey-blue of the shade
Or the cool gold-green of a glade
And the rose’s mystery.
But when you were first unrolled
Each arabesque enscrolled
The maker’s meed of praise
That the labor of long days
Shone forth in every fold
Of crimson and turquoise and gold
To catch the breath in amaze.

Our Valley.
When folk come to our valley
They praise its many charms—
Its sunny glades, its shady groves,
Its orchards and its farms;
But little do they ever talk,
And little seek to know,
Of those who tamed our valley,
And tilled it long ago.
Oh, pleasant is the faring
Of those who nowadays
In limousines at cushioned ease
Glide down our valley-ways;
But seen by neither sun nor moon,
And hidden from the stars,
Are those who to our valley
Came not in gilded cars.
Though now, ’neath green grass lying,
They know not heat nor cold,
Home-makers stout of heart were they
Who hither came of old;
All seasons saw them struggle
As only heroes strive,
And where they drove the furrow
The furrow now we drive.
As all at peace they slumber,
Those warriors brown and bold,
By tarnished cross and rain-worn slab
Their story is not told ;
But told it is by cornfields
And fields where clover foams,
And told by happy housefolk
In many cosy homes.
Know all who seek our valley,
Who hither idly stray,
Yon tasselled corn on flat and slope
You might not see to-day
If those who wrought before us
Had listless been and lax,
And never sped the ploughshare
And never swung the axe.
Wayfarers from the city,
Entranced ye well may be
By all the glory and the grace
Our valley offers ye!
But dearer than the vistas,
The scenes that charm ye so,
We hold the men who tamed it
And tilled it long ago.
With ceaseless tasks before them,
Beset by many cares,
No path of roses did they tread,
No couch of down was theirs;
Late, late, their pillows seeking,
At morn’s first glimmer up,
Scant comfort was their portion,
Poor was their bite and sup.
All ye who seek our valley
And feast upon its charms,
Its sunny glades and shady groves,
Its orchards and its farms,
I charge ye to remember,
Though cold they lie and low,
The pioneers who tamed it
And tilled it long ago.

TO-DAY’S Chrysler “66”—the
lowest-priced six ever to
bear the Chrysler name —is in
every way the biggest value
ever offered by Chrysler.
It gives you Chrysler beauty,
Chrysler luxury—and Chrysler
performance! Here is high-
compression power from any
gasoline. Here is a superb
engine with 7-bearing crankshaft
and Iso-therm Invar Strut
pistons; with impulse neutraliser
and with positive fuel pump,
instead of a vacuum tank.
Rubber engine mountings are
another outstanding Chrysler
advantage.
Here is the safety of weather-
proof internal-expanding four-
wheel hydraulic brakes. Here
are remarkable riding qualities
secured through a perfectly-
balanced chassis and extra-long
springs—and a new type of
rubber-core spring shackle,
noiseless, as well as resilient,
and never in need of lubrication.
Just ask the nearest Chrysler
dealer for a demonstration. He
will gladly place a Chrysler
“66” in your hands for any
test or series of tests you desire
to make.
