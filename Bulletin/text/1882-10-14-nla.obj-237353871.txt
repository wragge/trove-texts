The “Strike” Question.
“ A strike is a war, and all war is a waste of
the material means of the combatants.” This is
beginning to be recognised as a fact in the
periodical disagreements between the employers
and employed. Colliers, ironworkers, and painters
hare all appealed lately to the arbitrament of the
“strike,” as of old, but these disputes have been
notably free from the aggravations of former
times. The threats, the violence, title, rattening,
the persecution, which were at one time practised
in the old country, have not appeared here. Two
of the industries concerned nave referred their
differences to arbitration, and the principal speech
at the Painters’ meeting began with our opening
. quotation. It is well that people are beginning
to reckon up the cost of strikes. The masters
profits and the men’s savings alike disappear as if
they were thrown into the sea. People must live
somehow, though idle; rents need-to be paid;
the Society’s fund is fast eaten away. This is the
score on bne side.- The other side shows dead
capital and heavy arrears of interest, contracts
pressing but unfulfilled, and going into
othor channels ; while the whole neighbourhood
fed by the custom of the factory or workshop, the
tradesmen and suppliers of provisions, are driven
to straits. They press for accounts, and struggle
to keep their legs against the receding tide. Tnus,
the war affects not only the combatants, but the
whole helpless inhabitants of the country. A
victory, too, in industrial warfare may prove more
disastrous than a defeat. Some years ago, the
men held out so stoutly in a contest with Messrs
Russell, that the firm at length shut their gates for
good and all, and a yard that employed tour hun-
dred hands has been silent ever since. If the
ironworkers achieve another “ crowning mercy ”
like this, their trade may be driven clean away
from Sydney, as happened on the banks of the
Thames about ten years ago. But the late stop-
page at Mobt’s has been little accompanied by
any feeling of hostility, and one is tempted to
think it possible that the next hitch may per-
chance be settled without prefacing negotiation
with the time-honoured declaration of war
Touching this, we feel tempted to quote another,
passage from the book wnioh seems to be, by
common consent, the maaual for reference on
such topics “ Nobody quarrels but the bully
who has an object in it, or the incapable who do
not know how to put themselves rignt, except by
the primitive expedients of the savage or the
waahorwoman —by tbo of tbo tomahawk or
the tongs.” # # #
Meanwhile, pending the adjustment of these
disputes, Mr. (i. R. Dxbbs has come forward with
a proposal for the settlement of future differences,
which he offers to all concerned. It is, that a
joint council of twelve members be formed —six
to be elected from the employers of labour,
and six from the operatives which body
shall determine all trade disputes. Also, that
work shall go on (without cessation, and that the
amount of wages in question shall be paid ini o a
trust account, subject to the award. This, Mr.
Dibbs explains, is no now plan. A council so
constituted, and working successfully, has for
many years boon in oxisconca in the manutac •
turing districts of France. _ The Trades and
Labour Council decided to invite Mr. Dibbs_ to
explain his scheme in detail, and we think it a
happy omen of the times that the suggestion has
met with ready hearing.
• • •
It is time that workmen and proprietors alike
gave more study to their mutual relations. I be
operative of a generation ago, and perhaps
sometimes of a later date, cherished the crude
notion that the wealth which existed was so much
taken from himself, and that if there were no
capitalists and no organisation of industry,
he would be better off. A little consideration
might have shown him that his whole subsistence
was the joint product of capital and industry; and
without these elements, all but savage life would
be impossible. He, without capital in some shape,
either his own, or as an accessory and aid, would
have nothing but his hands and teeth. The capital-
ist class, too, must have learned that a mere
Operative caste is an unsatisfactory element in the
Wtato ; and that skilled, intelligent, hearty help, is
immeasurably more effective and more reliable
than so many head of the ordinary material called
“ labour.”
• • •
These strands of thought running through the
minds alike of employer, employed, and the general
public, must find expression in one direction, and
in Co-operation is unmistakably to be found the
solution of the present relations between master
and man. Clearly, that is the one method by
which the artizan may secure a substantial share
of the world’s goods, consistently with the welfare
of all others. Moreover, the method enables the
workman, if he possesses the necessary qualities
of industry, economy, and self-restraint, to act in
perfect independence of the capitalist. Co-opera-
tion quietly and silently makes new capital of its
own. Co-operators of this stamp do not petition
for an increase of wages. They supply their own
capital, fix their own wages, and divide the profits
among themselves. They rob no one, deprive no
one of his wealth, but simply exercise intelligently
the right of all to create new fields of production.
But we fear that this harvest, though boundless
in Australia, will attract few reapers yet. Co-
operators, being both capitalists and labourers,
and dependent on each other, should bo clear-
headed honest men. The men who have been
in the habit of demanding increased wages
as soon as a contract is signed, who
put on the screw whenever their employers
are in a fix, whoso idea of “good times”
is to “ kill the goose with the golden eggs,” would
never make co-operators. Such tricky habits would
stick to them, and their “ game” under co-opera-
tion would be to skulk work and sponge on the
common fund. It is said that some years ago
Mr. Bussell and Mr. Mobt both offered their
men the option of working on shares, but they
scorned the offer. They simply wanted the profits
and not the risks of the business.
J * • *
The operatives-who are now evincing some sense
and moderation in dealing with the question, can
hardly look back with much complacency on these
reminiscences. But the direction to which things
point now augurs the approach of a better st».t' of
affairs. When arbitration has been fairly estab-
lished as the tribunal of appeal between employers
and employed, then the half-way house to co-
operation has been reached. With security, perfect
freedom of contract, and mutual confidence, there
will open up fields of enterprise unthought of at
present, because they are too hazardous to e iter
upon under existing relations. With a wider range
of production, profits would be greater, while they
would also be more widely distributed ; work would
be better done, because every man would bear
a full share of responsibility; living would be easier,
and things all round would '»e better for everyone,
because the principle would find its application in
all other departments of life and enterprise besides
workshops. All acquainted with the history of co-
operation know that a great many such results
have been achieved already. Whila one of the
most powerful of liberal principles, the method
infuses a strongly conservative element into human
life, lor it heals discords and binds all interests
into one.
• • •
At the meeting of the Operative Painters, held
on the 28th ultimo, Mr. Drayton is reported to
have said : “In the event of the masters persist-
ing in their refusal to give the extra three half-
pence per hour, it would be desirable for the men
to become their own masters by starting a com-
pany on the co-operative principle.” If Mr.
Drayton thinks that he and his fellow-craftsmen
are competent to originate and carry out a co-
operative enterprise, we think it strange that he
and they should not enter upon the course at
once, instead of using such a threat to bring the
Master Painters to terms. If the Operative
Painters, or any of them, are able to do what
thousands of journeymen in Prance, Germany,
and Great Britain have done, there is a wide field
open for them. As tradesmen working on their
own account, they would be bound to do good
work if they want customers. In this character
they cannot fail to secure the good-will of their
fellow-citizens, and they need fear no opposition.
Mr. Drayton, evidently, is familiar with Georoe
Jacob Holyoakb’s writings. He can, then,
judge from these whether many of the artizans of
Sydney have the stuff in them, or feel those
incentives to exertion that have led to co-opera-
tive success elsewhere.
* • •
While counselling moderation and fair play to
the workman, we must express our earnest hope
that the Employers’ Association will abandon
that ill-omened condition of the “ticket” on
“discharge,” which they have inserted in the
draft agreement submitted by their representa-
tive. In the first place, there was a distinct want
of candour in smuggling in matter which was not
of the essence of the dispute. Secondly, there is
manifest an utter want of sound policy and true
wisdom in raking up such obnoxious stuff-more
especially when put forward by men many of
whom were using hammer and chisel themselves
not long ago. The Bulletin will always gladly
say a word towards a fair settlement, for the
masters as well as for the men, bat no backing
will ever be given to any attempt at refitting the
old collar on the neck of “ Gukth, the born thrall
of Cedric the Saxon.”
Squaring the House.
Sib Henry Pabkes, on the evening of Friday,
the 6th, threw a mess of offal before the popular
branch of the Legislature, and it was not hurled
back in his face. After a public calamity, which
involved an actual loss of at least half-a-million
sterling, and prospective troubles and expenses
that cannot be estimated likely to arise from the
destruction of public documents, the Premier
had the effrontery to move that the H < ise approve
of the erection of two buildings, to cost at least
twice as much as the temporary structure de-
stroyed. There is nothing to wonder at in Sir
Henbt Pabkes attempting to hoodwink the
Assembly ; to divert the attention of the members
from the criminal apathy of the Ministry in allow-
ing the destruction of the public records; or to
stave off the progress of needful legislation. And
there is nothing to wonder at in the tone taken by
his ally, Sir John Robebtson, in claiming that
“the representatives of the people” should bo
allowed “to settle this matter” without hind-
rance—or, rather, to carry out a nefarious job in
order to buy political support. There is still less
to wonder that the compact Government party,
the fifty “road and bridge” members who sit
behind the two knights, should see nothing to
object to. But tint the Opposition members
shonld practically condone the graver aspects of
the proceeding, is matter for deep public con-
cern. Instead of considering in a mildly
critical spirit the comparative advantages of
different sites for the proposed Art Gallery
and Library, the gentlemen who spoke might,
well have said —“ We cannot sufficiently conden tT
the recklessless and indecency of a motion that, in
the face of a loss involving consequences which
cannot be estimated, proposes so profligate an
expenditure of the public funds. While the
colony is daily more burdened with expenditure,
supported mainly by land-sales and loans, wo
shall object to all such extravagant disbursements.
When the Treasurer’s statement shall show a
public balance-sheet less dependent en these
sources of revenue; moreover, when land legis-
lation shall have placed settlement on a sounder
footing, and when a Local Government Bill shall
have attached certain distinct responsibilities to
the spending of public money on local wants, —
then, but not till then, we may feel justified in
counselling the construction of such buildings.”
And it would have been well to ask whether
any member of the Ministry had ever con-
sidered the risk of placing public records
in a building so liable to destruction by fire P
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Murder or Manslaughter?
Oe, with our glorious trial hy jury and weak-kneed
judges, is it te be mere arson ? The Coroner summed
up manslaughter and arson, and should only one or the
other of these be proved, Mr. Dunn, Sydney street-
ruffian, may in a few years’ time be round again with a
wad of straw and a box of safety matches, lighting the
funeral-pyres of the wives and children of Judges,
Juries, and Attorneys-General. Mr. Dunn may soon
again be at his old avocation of setting fire to dwelling-
houses where mothers and children lie asleep—darting
to fire-stations—getting rewards for giving alarms, and
frenziedly working the engines at so much per
hour to put out the fires his own villainous
hands have raised. “ Manslaughter,” indeed !
The man who, for the sake of a few paltry shillings,
could deliberately burn down a house, and roast a
woman to death, is a fiend, and fit only for the hangman.
This hideous event is the latest and worst development
of that preaioua and judicially-nurtured institution,
down-the-harbourism. The acting-Coroner should have
known that there is no law empowering him to commit
a man for “ manslaughter and arson.” The offence was
clearly “arson, involving murder.” Mr. Wisdom mu&t
see that Dunn is tried for his life. And, should Dunn be
convicted, then the John Plomer trick must noth*
repeated. Unless the Ministry do their duty in this
case, what is a gallows for ? Mr. Dunn, we noticed, is
a young gentleman with a very thick neck and a fins
lump under each ear.
The Teachers and the University.
Some people are prepared to be surprised at the infer,
mation which Mr. Marti* elicited last week on the
subject of the respective attendance at the University
and Technical College classes. There is very little
ground for surprise. The functions of these institr.*
tions are quite different. The Technical College, as at
present administered, teaches the primary subjects of
English, as well as strictly technical and literary ones;
whereas the University instructs those who have,been
well taught before they enter its classes. In a ward,
the University is the institution for the leisured and
brain-working; the Technical College is that of the
uuleisured and hand-working. It is pertinent to

Inquire why the Department of Public Instruction does
lot employ the University for the instruction of
leachers ? The training-school at Fort-street has been
iteadily sending out teachers with an assiduity highly
iommendable, if the results had been made encourag.
ng, and what have the recent departmental examina-
iions demonstrated ? Making all allowance for incom-
petence of examiners, it is now clear that, for years
past, the colony has been paying men for teaching what
they did not understand even fairly well. The palpable
failure of the teaching profession of the colony at the
recent examinations means more than a condemnation
of the department; it means that the Fort-street
training-school has been a failure. Now, would it not
be possible to train our teachers at the University in
literary subjects, leaving them to acquire the economics
of their business much as they do at present—i.e., as
pupil teachers ? Make it incumbent on the candidate
to matriculate at the University; it might not be
necessary for him to pursue the Arts course to 8.A.,
but we might create a degree here similar to the A.A.
(Associate of Arts) of Oxford. To keep him to the
standard in the subjects not taught in a University,
such as geography, and so on, a small staff might be
appointed to give instruction in these subjects. The
benefit to the teachers themselves, under this system,
would be great, but that accruing to the colony would
be infinitely greater. To have a thoroughly well-
instructed teaching profession, —why, it means that
the intellectual heritage of all the ages is made acces-
sible to the humblest child in the commonwealth.
A Rising Firm.
A return has been made, showing the amounts paid,
or estimated to be paid, to private architects for work
in connection with Public Schools. Mr. Mansfield,
for a projected large work, llikely to cost £20,000, is
down for £lOOO. Mr. Mayes, for three schools, will
receive £1110; and a Rising Firm top the list with five
schools, and will bag £1291 ss. Poor Mr. Barnet, the
Colonial Architect, who has designed everything of
note in the colony, draws his salary only. He was
good enough to design the Garden Palace, and but that
his hands were tied in the matter of having to use
kindling wood, we should have to-day a magnificent
structure and half a million to the good. Now comes
the time whea we have to rebuild, and Sir Henry
Parses has decided, in a magniloquent speech, that
this coming nation is entitled to rear a new structure
of material other than the brushwood he gave Barnet.
But Barnet is not to be in it. While Barnet has been
working his head off to do two men's work, and while
Sir Henry has been disporting his noble frame
amongst Westminster and oth n r palaces, a Rising Firm
has inspected the plans of Milan the Grand and Pt.
Peter’s, and has lavished its Michael Angelo wits
on the construction of schools and its own fortunes.
Barnet may now drudge on. All Australian
architects are to compete for the only work which
might immortalise an old and proved veteran,
in order, it is thought by some Members, that
Michael Angelo Blachmann and Inigo Jones Parkfs
may have another “throw-in." It is fortunate for
Mr. Blachmann that his colleague in the Rising
Firm is Inigo, and that Inigo is the son of a Premier.
The firm of Blachmann and Parses is no doubt com-
petent and reliable—still the question arises how long
it will be before Inigo is Colonial Architect, or are we
to have a Colonial Architect at all ?
Political Simony.
There is a simony of politics. Men whose months
drop the finest sentiments of political morality, and
who strut before the unthinking as the champions of
the poor man’s rights, and would-be saviours of their
country, are found to be but heartless octopi who throw
over the crowd their slimy grippers. “Go to,” saith
the Premier, “ let us build ns a new library. Let know-
ledge spread amongst the poorer population. Let en-
lightenment be provided for the meek and lowly, and
let the rich provide for themselves. Let us build in
Eedfern, and many dark souls shall be illumed.” “Yea,”
saith Angus, “ let us build where many shall see the
light." So far the apostles; how far the facts ?
Angus, who has completely shed his original political
skin, gets £5OO a year from the people’s Government.
Angus loves the working-man, and he will follow the
working-man’s soi-disant champion. As for the Premier’s
purpose, the concentration of great public institutions
at the Eedfern end of the city is nothing more than an
adroit and characteristic piece of crookedness,
planned with a view to preventing the extension of
the railway from Eedfern to the Circular Quay.
The separation of State institutions is opposed to all
modern notions of fitness. It is in accordance with the
wretched old system, hardly yet effaced, which dis-
tributed the various departments of our Lands Office
over half-a-dozen buildings—one a quarter of a mile
from the other. A library in Eedfern, a gallery of
sculpture in Woolloomooloo, a picture gallery at
Manly, and a museum at Balmain, will be the next
notion. Everything in the way of national institutions
relating to the higher displays of intellectual activity,
should be grouped as closely together as possible. We
do not want the Art Gallery at Potts’ Point, and the
literature of Art in Eedfern. The sincerity of the
Government may be gauged by that wretched piece of
claptrap—the production in the House on Tuesday
night of a bogus plan of a line connecting all the
wharves round the harbour with Darling Harbour.
In Melbourne, the National Gallery and School of Art,
the noble Public Library, and other institutions, are
beneath one roof. We go to Eome, the fatherland of
Art, and we find the same system at the Vatican. But
the aesthete Parses knows better than the Eomans
especially the Holy Eomans.
“Herald” Virtue and Liedertafel Cakes
and Ale.
The Sydney Liedertafel concert to-night will be held,
not at the Masonic Hall, but at the private residence
of Sir Patrick Jennings. The Masonic Hall is attached
to a hotel, and our glorious Licensing Act does not
admit of liquor being sold on the premises. The
Herald suggests that the members forego liquor and
content themselves with coffee and cigars. But why
accept this virtuous alternative ? Why not forego the
cotfea and cigars, too? Why not do without the
music? Grannt is constitutionally holy and bun-
loving and fish-blooded. She sees no connection be-
tween song and wine. She could probably enjoy a
dance where there was no music, and revel in a supper
where ham-sandwiches were tabooed, and where the
festive throng roamed through a wilderness of jam-
tarts. We shall yet learn from The Herald that
Mozart and Beethoven were strict teetotallers, that
they got all their inspiration direct from Heaven, and
that they never tickled up their geniusfes with Eudes-
heimer or Johannisberg. Oh, yes; let us hy all means
take music and wine separately in future. Let us have
“Dream'and” with a ginger-beer accompaniment, and
hug our partner in “The Blue Danube” with ecstasy
toned down by bromide of potassium, Herald
coffee, and a proper respect for the Licensing Act.
Hallelujah!

VANITY FAIR.
The use of chloral in England is increasing
greatly. When a liking is contracted, the desire
becomes bo strong, almost a necessity, that the victim
will descend to almost any Scheme to procure it. And
its victims are chiefly women—and aristocrats One
of the newest Paris hats is called the “ Melbourne j”
it is round, of straw and velvet, slightly turned up at
one side, trimmed with six feather tips and a long
plume; a buckle fastens the velvet ribbon on the
crown A surgeon said a fashionably-dressed woman
can scarcely draw a full breath with her clothes on.
Of course, at the opera, or a ball, she breathes freely....
“ Tom’s rather wild,” said Angelina, “ but there’s
something in him.” And Sis remarked —“Yes, beer.”
All Worth’s best-fitting costumes lace down the
back A new vagary of fashion —a hat of which the
crown was a perfect imitation of a barn-door rooster,
and the brim interlaced briars Kate Greenaway
balls are popular in England ; that is, juvenile affairs,
where every boy and girl is in the quaint pretty cos-
tume of those designs, looking as if he or she had just
stepped out of a story book. ...Picture this at a London
ball:— •’ Flowers in masses up the staircases, concealing
the balustrades, blinding the chandeliers, and forming
complete dados. Ferneries and rural walks, winding
till you could lose yourself, and leading over stiles of
delicious little fruit buffets. Everywhere wicket gates,
rustic porches, and devices to increase the illusion.”
A London belle climbing a stile in her ball dress would
be a novel sight Grayopaque is a new system ef

brilliant. Started in 'Frisco Pittsburg (U.B A. ) pro-
duces glass shingles A man in America abducted his
own child from the mother, in order to raise £2OOO from
the grandmother as a ransom. The money was paid
before his scheme was found 0ut.... A German
inventor converts valueless refuse of silk into a good
material. He dissolves the worthless stuff, and then
places linen or cotton fabric in a bath of the liquid, and
the fabric becomes rapidly and permanently coated with
the silk solution That curious native fruit, the quan.
dong, is now ripening It makes the tartest jam ex-
tant. The trees are almost nncultivatable when trans-
planted, and very scarce Last month, a Cremation
Congress was to be held in Modena. Italy. Here ara
some of the facts for prejudiced ignorami There
have been 219 cremations in Italy alone; there are there
22 societies, with 5000 members; there are six crema-
tories, and four more building. These are in Italy; but
cremation is making rapid progress elsewhere, especially
in America. The ’Frisco Newsletter gives the system
special attention and advocacy, contending that both
from sanitary and religions aspects it is really the
least offensive method of disposing of the dead

printed sateens are much worn in England; but the
once-prevailing aesthetic dresses are almost obsolete
already Followers of fashion in France wear their
dresses more and more bouffant. Sydney is pretty close
on the heels of “ the tyrant ’’ this time ” Dis-
inclined to dance ” is still the attitude of the male
habitues in both England and America, and it’s really
hard to guess what the crutch and toothpick crowd go
out for at all. It was in a tone of delicious satis-
faction that a young lady not long since unburdened
her joy to her friends thus: “ I say, girls, isn’t it
good, just for one night, to see enough men to go
round?" Kobert Herlitz, of America, asked the
Judge to “ dissolve " him, on the ground that he had
married her from fear of her father and big brother,
not from love for herself. The Judge said “ Non-
sense,’ Eobert.” His Honor had married an only
daughter himself Oscar went to see Henry Irving
play Hamlet. He was very pleased, and said there
is a soulful yearningness in Henry’s starboard leg only
equalled by the pathos of his port elbow Onefdte
given by Baron Eothsohild this year cost him £SOOO.
In a few years his fate will be just the same as any
other man's.

Walter Falls, son of one of the founders of the

from Newcastle.
The ladies of a Western township are on the
whole very strict in their Sabbath observances. One,
whose religion is of the ostentations order, and who
makes a practice of driving to church every Sunday (a
distance of two or three hundred yards), attached her
signature, the other day, to the petition praving fcr
the proper observance of the Loard’a Day. Parhaps,
after ail, she may have thought the petition was for
the removal of the town pound.
The Koumiis (milk diet) Manufacturing Com-
pany, who have recently gone extensively into business
in Sydney, find their production to be a great success.
Koumiss, it appears, is a genuine assistant to digestion
and is a moat invigorating drink. It is made from pure
country milk, arrangements for supply being very com-
plete. Once tried. Koumiss is likely to hold a con-
tinuous place in every household. It is a most refresh-
ing summer beverage.

THE GREAT
ONE OP THE WOBLD’S GEEATEST
OAESMEN.
T® a **«ent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative o( one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Trickett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
•* I have found St. J AGOB’S OIL a sure and certain
Cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in hack, brought on by over-ex.
ortion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble.*’
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and sow he says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, &r
what all our young men want.

Administered in a warm bath is the only method
by which every muscle, nerve, and bone, can be affected
at the same time. It removes chronic liver complaints,
congestion, tumours, rheumatism, &0., and rids the

The circulation of The Bulletin has reached so many
thousands, viz., 23,200 per week, that it is deemed ad-
visable to use it as a medium for conveying: to all parts
and to all classes the popular Ji«ts contained in the now
famous ECONOMICAL HOUSE FURNISHING
GUIDE. It is therefore our intention to give an ex-
tract in every issue, and thus brine before the public
the contents of the NEW BOOK in WEEKLY PARTS.

THE
ECONOMICAL
HOUSE FURNISHING GUIDE.
SINCE House Furnishing Lists were first intro-
duced at the Royal Furnishing Arcade they have
steadily increased in public favonr, until, now, they are
almost indispensable, insomuch that our business could
not well be carried on without them. They are of
great assistant to buyers, and save considerable time in
the transacting of business. Being suggestive they are
sought after by intending buyers, and enable the
thoughtful and economically disposed to base their cal-
dilations and arrive at the exact cost of what they are
likely to require. This publication contains our £l5,
£25, £35, £sl», £7O, £lOO, £2OO, and £3OO lists, carefully
revised and remodelled. The first shows how a married
couple can, if necessary, commence housekeeping with
an outlay of only £l5. The last shows how a house
can be furnished really nicely for £3OO. Our business
is of course not confined simply to these lists; on the
contrary, wo are prepared to give estimates and fur-
nish throughout to almost any extent. Taking the
£2OO house, for example, it may be well to explain that,
when required, any of the articles, or any of the rooms
may be left oat, or others substituted. One might be p
lover of pictures, and not care mueh for music; in
which case the piano could be dispensed with, and the
£26 thus released would purchase a nice collection of
oil-paintings, oleographs, or engravings. Another per-
son might not require so many bedrooms, in which
cas« one could be left out of the list, and the price of
the house reduced by so mush, or the proceeds devoted
to furnishing a hall or small library, according to taste.
Persons arriving in Sydney and taking apartments, may
select any room or rooms from these lists,—may coma
and choose the articles, and get comfortably settled
within a few hours. It has been thought that our dis-
play might sometimes be the means of discouraging
parties of limited means from furnishing with ns : this
wo trust has never been the case. Our stock comprises
furniture and general household requisites to suit every
class of purchaser : in fact, it is our great aim to study
economists, and bring within the reach of everyone
household comforts at the lowest net cash prices. In
submitting these lists, we take the opportunity to ex.
press our sincere appreciation of the Immense amount
of encouragement and support we have received, and to
assure our patrons that we shall at all times endeavour
to give satisfaction in everything.

LIST *o. 1.
THAT FIPTI ’IN FOUNDS
Will suffice to furnish a neat little House suitable for a
married couple may appear surprising. Nevertleless, it
is quite true, and most persons will agree with us that
it is much more comfortable to commence housekeep-
ing in an unpretentious marner, and have everything
paid for, than to have that constant depression of spirits
which naturally ensues wher me is overburdened with
debt, and daily using unpaid . jr furniture.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Mr. Dalton, who was tutor to the Princes when
they were here, has been made a C.M.G. fill
Sir John Robertson’s birthday is at hand.
The Beform Club, of which Free-selection Jack is
President, will give him a dinner.
Mr. W. B. Dailey, Q.C., has, we hear, been
retained at a heavy fee to defend William Allison,
charged with the manslaughter of William Palmer, at
Wilson’s Downfall. The case will be heard at Armidale.
“That eminent barrister and gnarled politician,
Mr. David Buchanan, triumphed six times over the
Book to which he says he goes for “ all his instruction
and guidance.” Five divorced women and one divorced
man were re-married last year. Draw the p«n through
that seventh commandment, David.
Mr. Thomas Boland expired at his residence,
Longford, about five miles from Carooar, on the 25th
ultimo, having attained the advanced age of one hun-
dred years. He was a native of Sligo, came to this
colony about fifty years ago. and engaged in pastoral
pursuits. He was held in high esteem for the probity
and uprightness of his character.
Curious. Sir Charles Lilley, C.J. of Queens-
land, recently had a man imprisoned for driving by the
Court House in his buggy. Yet several people who, in
previous sessions had driven by in other people’s
buggies, have been acquitted. This was the learned
judge who refused—haughtily refused a knighthood—
that was never offered. But “listening to the repre-
sentations of friends,” etc.
Mr. J. Fairburn, C.E., of Auckland, has handed
us photos, bv Bartlett, of the city named, of Tawhaio,
the Maori King, and his two queens, Ngahuia and
Parihauraki. The latter, who is Tawhiao’s favourite,
has a face so gentle and refined that it would be
admired anywhere; Ngahuia, on the other hand, is
in many respects not unlike her lord, who looks the
stern old warrior that he is.
General Ducrot is dead. He was the General
who, having escaped from the Germans after Sedan,
was charged by them with having broken his parole.
They even threatened to shoot him if they took him
prisoner during the siege of Paris. He led several
desperate sorties, it will be remembered, and rather
foolishly declared on one occasion that he would come
back dead or victorious. As a matter of fact, he came
back defeated.
When Sir Samuel Wilson saw that the advanc-
ing tide of settlement would overwhelm squatterdom in
Victoria, he just took one look out of the West window
of Lengerenong Towers, and said: "I pass.” That
same week Longerenong station was sold at Scott’s
hotel, in Melbourne, to the highest bidder. £75,000
was paid for it to the auctioneers, and when the pur-
chasers came to take possession of their property they
found that, out of 325,000 acres of land, 220,000 had
been selected.
Sydney Taiwhanga, who the other day headed
the deputation which went home to interview Queen
Victoria, is a full-blooded Maori, and a land-surveyor by
profession. On one occasion he took it into his head to
start a store at a place called Kaikohe, in the Bay of
Islands district. Although he had to bring his goods
140 miles by sea, and then cart them 20 miles inland
over a mountain road, haulage on which was 245. per
ton for that short distance, he still managed to sell the
stores at less than what he paid for them in Auckland.
Though Skobeloff hated the Germans, as a
nation, many of his personal friends were of that
nationality. That he detested the English likewise is
well known. By a curious dispensation of fate he died
in the hotel “ Anglia,” the companions of his orgie on
the night of bis death were Germans, and the Hotel
Dusanx, to which his body was conveyed, is kept by
Germans. Skobeloff was possessed of an income of
100,000 roubles—at the present rate of exchange about
£lO,OOO a year. With the exception of a small annuity
to his wife, his property will be equally divided among
his three sisters. This latter statement, which has for
its authority a German journal, hardly tallies with
the story told by Mr. Archibald Forbes concerning the
great General’s domestic affairs.
This is a true bill. An eminent Sydney comedian
is in the habit of confusing the identity of two rising
barristers, Thompson and Johnson. Early in the fore-
noon he met Thompson at the Club, and noticed that
his eye was bandaged. A few hours later he met John-
son with a friend, and walking up to him ejaculated,
" By Jove, Thompson, you’ve got rid of your bandages
very quickly.” Johnson, a humorous dog, "took it,”
and winked at his friend, observing: “ It wasn’t much—l
gave him more than he gave me.” “Do you knew,”
proceeded the young comedian—“l get awfully mixed
up between yon and Johnson. By Jove, if Johnson'd
only keep sober, and yon often got screwed, I’d not be
able to tell the difference at all.” Tableau I—Johnson
felt himself “ had.”
Mr. George Armstrong has brought with him
from Milpariuka a well-preserved piece of the
historic boat left at Mount Poole by Captain Sturt, on
his last exploring expedition in 1844, after
discovering Cooper’s Creek. The relic is about 2i feet
long by 3-8 of an inch thick, and of the nature of
kauri pine, though now much darker in colour. From
the 1 apering of the board at one end, it is supposed to
have formed part of the bow of the boat. Some of the
nails are still in the wood, and are of cut iron, and in
a tolerable state of preservation. It was found in the
sand at Evelyn Creek, about a quarter of a mile from
Depot Glen, where one or two other pieces of the boat
had been found. Mr. Mae Arthur King, police magis-
trate at Milparinka, has a larger piece of the boat,
which is supposed to have belonged to near the keel.
The places where the nails were are now holes nearly
big enough to receive a man’s finger. Poor Sturt
returned from this, bis last trip, with the loss of his
eyesight, which he never recovered, and died in Chel-
tenham in 1869.
A couple of years ago, in N.Z., the Native De-
fence Minister was called upon to account for certain
moneys entrusted to him for reproductive works. The
following extract from the list submitted by him to
Parliament will show how the money was expanded:—
“No. 1, Marble bust of a native chief in Waikato,
executed by an English sculptor, price £2OO. No. 2,
Two pairs of embroidery scissors and tea yards of red
braid, presented by the Defence Minister to Mrs. ,
half-caste, on account of Government. No. 3, One
breach-loading fowling-piece, present to Maori chief in
Waikato for good behaviour, price £l7. No. 4, One
patent double-furrow plough, present frem Government
to native chief for good behaviour. No. 5, Four hundred
gallons milk and medical comforts, presentfrom Govern-
ment to Mrs. and children, Maori chief’s widow,
residing at Waikato. No. 6, Buggy and horse tonative
chief for good behaviour. Ne. 7, Long bill from Auck-
land cab-proprietor re cab-hire by native chiefs while
doing the lions of Auckland. No. 8, Eationa of flour,
tea, and sugar, served out to natives too lazy or impro-
vident to work for themselves.
When Mrs. Langtry was playing Rosalind, in
America, a N.Y. Herald reporter interviewed her. Ho
found her in her room in a loose robe, with luxuriant
hair falling below the waist, which, with her back to
the fire, she was drying. After apologising, say* the
reporter, for her deshabille, she said, with a bewitching
smile; “Now interview me, please.” He did. The
vreat beauty told him that not only was her father
Dean of Jersey, but the oldest Dean in the Church of
England, and that, curiously, all her ancestors—father,
grandfather, and great-grandfather, and she did not
know how many more, had been Deans. Her pedigree,
though not of the very highest, was unimpeachable;
she was born and educated in Jersey, and, as the only
girl among six stout brothers, was a perfect tomboy at
rough field sports, which would, no doubt, assist greatly
towards the graceful freedom of movement that i?, in
her, such a charm. She was never a boarding-school
bread-and-butter Miss. Her husband, when he won
her, was worth about £3OOO a year in Irish property.
It was at a London theatre one evening Frank Miles,
the sketcher and painter, was struck by her appear -
sue*. For some time he tried in vain to discover who
she was, raving to all his artist friends of the “new
beauty” he had seen. She was then scarcely known.
«-t last he proeured an introduction, painted her por-
trait, sold it to Prince Leopold, and in a moment she
**s famous, invited everywhere, and exalted by the
highest people in social circles, including the Prince
°f Wales. Her husband was greatly delighted
& t her social success—which, however, he did
not care himself to share—and freely supplied her with
money to move in society. Then painters “ worked
her up,” quite of their own accord, without wish of her
o *n. They raved of her “ classical head,” and the
" lines of beauty ** in her neck and bust. Miles,
Millais, Bnrne Jones, and Frith, all painted her por-
traits; then the photographers followed; their
windows were thronged, and people would stand on
chairs to see her pass down the street. Mrs. Langtry
went on the stage simply from necessity. Her
husband’s property decreased in value, money was
scarce, and the beauty went back to her Jersey home.
It was then that Frank Miles and other friends eng.
gested the stage. The idea startled her. but Mr.
Langtry, who was proud of his handseme wife’s
triumphs, left the question to be decided by herself,
and, after some trepidation, she adopted the idea of
“professional” life in her present line. The Jersey
Lily disclaimed the idea of putting any value on her
personal charms, and said plainly : “ I had never set
myself up as a beauty ; I never thought I was one, and
don’t think lam one now. lam never in the least
surprised when I hear people say they are disappointed
about my beauty. But the artists insisted I was one.”
The reporter’s interesting interview was closed by Mrs.
Langtry saying with delicious naivete—” And now, I
really wish you had not made me talk so much about
myself.”
Henry Labouchere tells the following story :
“ I remember being on friendly terms with a scnlptor in
Italy. * I cannot understand,’ some one said te him,
‘how it is that the legs of yoar nymphs and Yenuses
are so abnormally thinP ’ ‘I have,’ he replied, ‘a wife,
as you know. She is jealous, and she regards her own
legs as perfection. Were I to give my female statues
proper legs, my domestic bliss would cease.’ ” We are
exceedingly pleased to note the above, because it proves
that even the greet Labouchere is only mortal—com-
posed, in fact, of the same materials as the Brevity
builder of Bennett, or the leader worrier on the D.T.
The fact is, one Samuel Coleridge told the following
yarn before ever Henry’s father was introduced to his
mother" There was once a Greek sculptor who
acquired great fame for the legs of his goddesses,
although the rest of his figures were poorly executed.
His wife being asked one day to explain the reason,
modestly replied she herself washer husband’s model.”
Great minds frequently run in the same groove, but in
this case Samuel seems to take the cake for originality.
Apropos of Coleridge, his college tutor had a
decided mania for flogging; his favourite plan being to
hoist the victim on a fellow pupil’s back, and then skelp
away until he stood up to his knees in perspiration.
Samuel was the recipient of many shingle favours at his
hands, and being shown a copy of some plump, naked
little cherubs by Eaphael, he asked if that was the
costume the juvenile angels wore in heaven. Being
told it was, he let off a 40 horse-power sigh, and said :
“ Then I sincerely pity the poor little beggars if my
old master ever gets up there, and is allowed to take
his birch with him.”
The Eev. Charles R. Currey has written what
he calls an “ Australian National Ode,” and has had
the hardihood to send us a copy. The Beverend
Cnrrey’s ode is hash. We quote:
“ Love, in thrilling accents sweet.
Friends and dear ones frankly greets;
Winsome charms are bright displayed
By the gentle Austral maid.”
Now, what wo chiefly want to know, is not where his
reverence learnt the maniac metre in which he writes,
but how he came to find ont the “charms” of the
“ gentle Austral maid.” If we go to church on a Sun-
day, and pay our money for a front seat to hear a close-
shaven bulldog-jowled man anathematising the sins of
the flesh, we like to know that the thing is square. But
we don't like the holy man to fold up the whites of his
eyes, and wink at the first likely-looking girl be meets
the minute he comes ont of the pulpit. If it were not
for our safe anchorage on Eli Johnson’s morality and
Joe Cook’s theology, we should have drifted to damna-
tion long ago with such examples before our eyes. His
reverence, we might remark, has also written an ode
which he dedicates to the President of the United
States. We now laying six to four that that gentleman
will snieide if he receives the “ ode.” We can’t quote
from it just now, because we have used it up,
together with three or four hundred similar sap-
phics to make out a schedule of our hash-bills.
But, if the Beverend Charley will take our
advice, he will, in future, before ravishing the souls of
the public with his productions, read them over to his
dog. And if they are anything like what he has sent
us, ho will have to get a new dog every day.
It is gratifying to learn of the distinguished
success that has attended one of our natives, Mr. W. 0.
Wilkinson, the eldest son of Judge Wilkinson, at the
London University. Mr. Wilkinson is not unknown to
many of our readers. Before leaving for London, he
obtained his degree of B A. at Sydney University, gain-
ing a scholarship each year, and winning three gold
medals at his final examination. He arrived in London
in February 1878, and in July of the same year he passed
in the first division at the preliminary scientific exami-
nation in the London University, and a'so on entering
University College, London, he won an exhibition of £2O
for two years. In his second year in the University
College (sessions 1879-1880) he gained two silver medals
—one for Anatomy and another for Materia Medica.
In his third year (sessions 1880-1881) he won the gold
medal for Medicine and the first medal (silver) for
Ophthalmic Surgery. In his fourth year (sessions
1881-1882), at the end of last year, he was awarded the
highest prize given at University College, viz., the
Fellows’ gold medal for Clinical Medicine; and the
Professor who examined the papers stated that the
papers of five of the competitors were worthy of a gold
medal. At the same session, Mr. Wilkinson also ob-
tained the Atchison Scholarship (£55 tor two years),
which is awarded to the student who has gained most
honours daring the preceding two years. He was also
awarded the second silver medal for Surgery. In July,
1880, Mr.'Wilkinson passed the first M.B. in the London
University with honours. He was appointed demon-
strator in Anatomy for six months during the winter
session of 1SS1; and, in April last, he was appointed
house physician to University College Hospital, which
position he vaeates at the end of October this year. In
July last he became an M.E.C.S, of London. We notice
that Mr. Wilkinson has also distinguished himself
athletically.
Mrs. Plimsoll, who died at Brisbane recently,
will long be remembered in the Press Gallery of the
British House of Commons. Thanks to the ex-member
for Derby’s allusions to “dear Eliza,” and the influ.
ence she exerted on his political action, she was, in
fact, more than a name to the British public generally;
but the Parliamentary reporters have special reason to
bear her in mind. For it so happened on that memor-
able night when the “ Sailor’s Friend ” executed his
now historical pas seal on the floor of the House, and,
after dancing before the Mace, shook his fist almost in
the then Mr. Disraeli’s face, that Mrs. Plimsoll had
come down to the House and gained admission to the
Ladies’ Gallery, bearing a bag of such unusual dimen-
sions that the door-keeper essayed to relieve her of it.
She objected to relinquish it, however; and as explana-
tion brought out the circumstance that it contained
Mr. Plimsoll’s robe de nuit and the various toilet requi-
sites for an M.P. who is about to sleep away from home,
the bag was passed, and Mrs. Plimsoll bore it to her
seat in triumph. The fact was, it had been packed in
full expectation that its owner would pass the night in
the Clock Tewer, so determined was he to “ have his
fling” at the Government. But of this episode the
Press Gallery only learned later on; and it was a sud-
den shower of printed! documents, descending on their
devotedjheads from the “ Ladies’Cage” above, which
first drew attention to Mrs. Plimsoll’s presence. If
the House would not hear her husband's protest, she
was determined the country should, and so deluged the
reporters with printed copies of it. The incident was
characteristic of this true and staunch North-oonntry-
woman, who for twenty-five years has been in the fullest
sense her husband’s helpmate, and her loss has been
most severely felt, the more so as a journey to Queens-
land had been planned for the benefit of her health.
This trip, however, Mr. Plimsell’s public duties,
especially in connection with the Sbadwell Fish Market
Bill, had for some time delayed, and now, sad to say, it
is too late.

THE NEWSLETTER.
Messrs. A. Tobin and Son, of Wingadee, expect
to shear close on 500,000 sheep this year. The
whole of the clip will be scoured and damped on the
station.
The Wagga Wagga Advertiser termed Mr.
Charles Hardy ‘a “ dilatory ” contractor, and Charles,
of oonrse, sued the paper for damages. Jury haggled
for two solid hours without agreeing.
During the hearing of an affiliation case, at
Parramatta, on the plaintiff being called, two young
girls, with a baby each in their arms, made their appear*

thought both cases were going to be tried at once.
Victorian speculators have offered .£14,000 for
the whole of the claims at Upper Bingera. This has
been indignantly refused, as Miller and party want
£lO,OOO for their claim alone. The gold, says the local
George Washington, is in layers as large as a man's
band; and as much as 1000 ez. have been raised in one
week.
Another land dodge. A Lachlan squatter was,
the other day, “ tipped a wink," on the quiet, that a
dummy selection of an employe of his would probably
be forfeited for non-fulfilment of conditions. There-
upon the squatter immediately ran up a hut on the
land, so as to block it from selection by improvements,
and so preserve it for his own use in any case.
Since the introduction of the Id. postage in
England, the average number of letters delivered te
each person in the Kingdom has increased from three
to thirty-five. Altogether, 1,200,000,000 letters were
delivered by tbe Postmaster-General's department in
the last year. 27,000 were posted without any address.
One person posted a £5-note, uncovered, with only the
address and a postage stamp on it.
An extraordinary operation, which will serve
to show the perfection which surgery has attained, has
been performed at Prague. A riding-master, who had
oaacer in the throat, had the whole of the larynx and
epiglottis removed, and an artificial larynx inserted.
After a while the man learned how to insert the reed
which takes the place of the vocal chords ; and he can
now, by aid of the apparatus, speak and eat with
perfect ease.
In Melbourne Hospital, last May, Dr. Mother-
well, with the largest number in his ward, issued an
average of } oz. of spirit per patient; Mr. Howitt comes

times as much as Dr. Motherwell.
The Grand Papau G. M. Co.’s teams left Nor-
manton on the 15th instant, with 12 tons pyrites for
shipment to London. There are more pyrites to
follow. Twenty-one tons pumping machinery, also a
set of Brown and Stansfleld's concentrators, passed
Clarke Eiver, en route for Georgetown, on the 14th

The Postmaster-General of America finds last
year a discrepancy of £1,600,000 between the amount of
mail matter sent through the post and the amount of
postage stamps sold. As matter can’t go free unde-
tected, tbe surmise is that there is fraud in stamps.
However, part of the sum, as Postmaster-General
Pearson says, may bo explained away by the well-known
tendency of Postmasters to over-estimate their returns.
In small offices, letters are counted, but in large ones
they are estimated only, and the official never reports
bis work as less than it really is.
On “ London ’Change, ” during the week pre-
vious to the crumpling up of Arabi Bey and his merry,
merry men, the public were breaking their necks to
get rid of Egyptian Bonds at any cost. Certain persons,
who were afterwards discovered to have been in posses-
sion of the best “ political information,” trooped along
and generously stopped the panic by buying up all the
scrip they could lay their hands on. To-day they are
returning thanks for Garnet's “glorious victory,"
whilst the sellers are howling their heads off.
To the Editor. — Sir, — I am a surveyor’s
assistant on the Trigonometrical Survey, at the miser-
able wage of ss. per day. Ido wo-k which requires the
greatest care, and is oftentimes unhealthy and danger-
ous. What men of my class have to complain of is—
(1) That our pay is insufficient, and wo do not get it
before the 16th or 18th of the month; (2) That some
of us do not get the full wage allowed to us by the
Government, and that the surveyors (with very few
exceptions) employ the men as their private servants—
as grooms, gardeners, carpenters, Ac.—at the Govern,
ment expense. If we complain, we are dismissed. A
surveyor discharged me for refusing to pay several
shillings per week towards the rent of his house, which
house I never saw. He made the men pay his rent.
Another surveyor whom I know draws, or did draw,
38s. 6d. per week for a man, and only gave him 15s. He
also draws 355. per week for a cook, and only gives him
Hs. He charges his men 15s. per week for board, when
ho is only allowed to charge 10s. Such doings are of
common occurrence. So you can perceive, sir, that
some of those gentlemen add a nice sum to their income
by such vile means. I think it is but just that such a
disgraceful state of things should be exposed, and it is
only through the medium of the Press that we, the
victims, expect to get our grievances noticed. —I am,
sir, yours truly, Chaikman.
To the Editor. —Sir, —In a certain Government
drafting department the officers are employed in a room
which was condemned more than three months ago by
their medical adviser (Dr. Cox) as totally unfit
for human habitation, the surroundings of the place
and the building itself being, in the doctor’s opinion,
calculated to generate fever and disease. Still, no steps
have been taken to remove the draftsmen to a more
healthy locality. The doctor recommended that the
salaries of two of the draftsmen who had been away ill
should be paid, also that their doctors’ bills should bo
settled by the Department, and this recommendation
has received the approval of the Minister —who, while
thus admitting his belief in the correctness of the
doctor’s opinion, still takes no steps to remove his
subordinates from the danger to which they are
exposed. Moro doctors’ bills and sick-leave after-
wards will have to be paid shortly. It also appears
that the destruction of the Garden Palace, with all its
contents, is not sufficient warning to the Government,
for instructions have now been issued to light a fire
in the cellar beneath the condemned room every after-
noon, from 3 o’clock to 6, in order to dry the cellar.
This fire is left from; half-past 4 till 6 without super-
vision, though the rooms above contain most valuable
and expensive documents, which are exposed to the
risk of being burnt at any moment.—Tours truly

The gloom in which we were plunged by the de-
parture of Clark and Hyman's Minstrels from the
Gaiety has been somewhat dispelled by the arrival of
our own Pomeroy. Louise has not lost any of her
beauty in her cometary tour through the colonies,
though—we suppose we must say it—many millions of
admirers have lost their hearts. Her accents are as
winning and American, and her smiles as sparkling and
extensive, as they were on that memorable night when
we first saw her and became her slaves for ever. So
much by way of compliment; now for hard fact.
* • •
“ Led Astray” was the play produced on Satur-
day nieht. Louise gets on very well as Countess
Armande Chandoce, though there is a certain setni-
masculina roughness about her action now and tben,
which is not quite what we expect from such a soft and
sentimental creature as the Countess is supposed to have
been. Her manner also of delivering the statement
that she will go to the Opera and smoke out Kodolph's
little intrigue is a hit over-tragic for the necessities of
the situation, though it would be imposing if she were
storming at her chamber-maid to know what had be-
come “ of them har-pins.” Yet, taken tout ensemble,
smile and all, Louise plays her part as well as, perhaps,
we can expect to see such things done until actresses
are made by a new process.
• ft ft
Next in order is Mr. W. J. Holloway, the
11 Recount.” This is his own pronounciation of his
title, so it must be right. If ability went by weight,
Mr. Holloway would be a great actor. It is a teal pitv
for him that it doesn't. He looks a presentable enough
sort of nobleman, doesn’t fall over chairs, or get his
legs twisted together in making melodramatic exits ;
but that is all. He is not —we say it ruthlessly—suffi-
ciently high-toned for the part he undertakes. The grand
sentiments he gives utterance to in the later scenes of
the drama, degenerate into copybook maxims by the
way in which he delivers them, Hot that he doesn’t
deliver them impressively enough, but that one feels
they are his “ only stock and store,” and that when he
has got rid of them he will be a moral bankrupt. They
don’t seem to be a part of W, J’s. personality, and
the outcome of his own thought, but simply a number
of set speeches learnt by rote and made use of on the
first favourable occasion. That’s Mr. Holloway as the
Keeount.
ft ft ft
Mr. Elliott as George de Lesparre, “ poet and
novelist,” is a perfect “masher." There is an air of
grandiose melancholy—a look at profound Promethean
despair about him—that would, be appallingly charming
if it were not so suggestive of recent sea-sickness. His
gait is dignified. He never hurries whatever happens,
but strides proudly along like an emu with a stiff leg.
That is because he is a poet.. His reference to his
“luggage,” we presume, was only a piece of pleasant
irony. A poet never has any luggage—except what he
carries away from his last boarding-house. More
seriously, Mr. Elliott acted th e character very well,
ft ft ft
Ladies, advance. Miss Kate Arden (Dowager
Countess de Chandoce) you are just a trifle too stately.
Because you are playing the part of a grande dame, you
needn’t purse your lips toge ther as if you were pea-
shooting when you speak. It isn’t necessary that you
should attenuate your voioo till it sounds like the
whistling of the wind through a keyhole in order to
impress your hearers with the delusion that you are
speaking “society” English. If you imagine that you
are speaking the speech of high society, you are right
in a way—the society in a balloon five miles up in the
clouds—for instance, where a man has to use a cow-
horn to speak to the man next him. Otherwise, Miss
Arden will passwoll. Miss Blanche Lewis, as Baroness
de Eivonniere, is stylish and showy enough for the part,
and plays very fairly.
ft ft ft
Miss Essie Jenyns (Mathilda) shall have a
paragraph all to herself, which we wish we could make
as pretty as she is. Her acting is very gracefnl, and
characterised by a natural naivetd that is admirably in
accordance with the requirements of the character she
Plays. In fact
Her sweet face is so dainty whits
That one imagines she must be
A lily grown in ways of light,
A rose blown from a white rose-tree.
How gad it is to think that this
Is sham —to think the cheek whose faint
Ko c e-bloom a man would die to kiss
Is half white powder, half red paint.
But, for all that, she is a very pretty little girl leaving
powder and paint considerations out of the question.
Enrihermore, she is a charming little actress, wlieh
we don’t eay to please her, because [we are old and
wrinkled and unlovely to.behold.

Misa Florence Lewis plays Susanna O’Hara
v ery nicely. As a matter of proportion, we know we
ought to say a good deal more of her, hut s pace
' won’t run it.” In default, we kiss onr hand to her.
We dare say Miss Kate Clayton’s performam« of
“ophie, the soubrette, was a masterpiece of drat ratio
rigour, but we didn't see it.

not by any means a bad one for such plays as ■“ Led

Louise’s Hamlet,
As we are threatened with the production of
“ Boccaccio” over here one of these days, our readers
might like to know something of the libretto, and so
steel their nerves for the worst. The copy we have be-
fore us is the American edition, and professes to be an
adaptation from the German by one Dexter Smith, who
is the editor of something or other—probably a fish-
shop bill of fare—in the States. It reads like a Solomon
Island dir<e. Boccaccio, the hero, is the youth who
wrote “ Decameron,” and managed to get himself into
trouble much in the way that we have done occasion-
ally by telling people disagreeable truths. The men of
Florence go hunting round for him warbling the follow-
ing beautiful bit of bosh
“ We shall meet him, sometime, somewhere, and beat
him.
Yes, that is truly so. The mean scamp shall not mock
us;
We won’t stand that.
Just wait, we shall meet him sometime, somewhere.
Hear our oath that we will kill him—
The knave, we threaten him. We will kill him,
Would we could massacre him now. We will revenge
ourselves —
No, we will not spare the rascal —he dies, he dies —yes!
Keep silence, adders, wild cats —believe our words—
Beware our fists, or you’ll get the worst of it;
Beware our strong blows, mind you that.”
The skilful artistic construction of the metre here is
only surpassed by the slashing invective it embodies,
and both are weirder than anything we have ever had
the fortune to come across in this line —except, perhaps,
the now world-famed libretto of—well never mind.
We never inflict unnecessary pain. The plot is
poorer than a dramatic critic. The Prince of Palermo
comes to Florence,and falls in love with the daughter of
a barber, but goes back on her for the favours of the
heiress of a cooperage. But Boccaccio is in love with
the latter, and she with him. Just about here the plot
gets as thick as the librettist’s head, and the dialogue
thicker than that of a reporter after a testimonial
banquet. Things are finally arranged by the Prime,
felling out his interest in the cooperess to Boccaccio,
and going home to Palermo to write Paris letters for the
Sydney Morning Herald, and take contracts for the
supply of organ-srinders tothe rest of the earth. We
have not heard the music of “ Boccaccio” yet, nor,, if
if it is anything like the dialogue, do we intend to wliile
there are cellars in the city to hide in. Librettos of the
bind written by Mr. Dexter Smith are only fit for plug-
ging up rat-holes.

Little Goodie, at the Eoyal, has always, some-
how, had a reputation for charity, but now he is regarded
as the patron saint of the poor and afflicted. The other
night a seedy man knocked at the door of the office and
demanded assistance. He said he was a country editor
out of lu;k. “I have,” remarked the visitor, plain-
tively, “ neither food wherewith to nourish me, nor a
roof under which to shelter my head." “ Is it so bad as
that?" enquired G.L., with a sigh; “well, just go as
far as the corner and wait. Then, if I can’t board you,
I will endeavour to give you some place to live in.”
The man, much affected, desired to kiss the hem of his
benefactor’s garment, and, having been graciously per-
mitted to do so, shuffled away to the trysting-place.
Five minutes later he was rejoined by Goodie, who pre-
sent 3d him with one of J. P. Macdonald’s boots.

The-latest lie about poor Soldene is that she
engaged a company to travel the English provinces with
“ Die Meistinger," but, on the news being telegraphed
to the London Standard that the English had been
defeated by Arabi, her services were at once engaged by
the Government. They argued that if she couldn’t
frighten the Egyptians first and spoil them afterwards,
no one c0u1d......We are sorry, while on the theme of
star performers, to have to announce that Miss Theresa
Horan has been dangerously ill, but is now better. She
desires us to state that the people who were turned
away from the theatre at Grafton on her benefit night
were all “sugared up” to the extent of Boxing-night
prices. The piece, it seems, was magnificently put on,
carte-blanche having been given by the amateurs to the
fair artistes in re their costumes. It appears there was
not a hitch in the opera or the sailors’ pants, as Jennie,
who cut them out, used rather too small a model—the
result being that no sailor could sit down without
danger of fearful consequences. The dresses were only
made just in time, as Miss Eugenie “struck” at the
eleventh hour, not considering that cutting out bank-
clerks’ pants was a star part.

A lady, who we trust! is prettier than her
oaligraphy, writes us as follows :—“ Could you tell me
how one can gjet best into the dramatic profession ? Is
there any good teacher at Sydney who can procure en-
gagements (when one is proficient).” There are several
ways, dear child, of “ getting into ” the dramatic pro-
fession—as you poetically put it. The quickest way is
to lease a theatre yourself—the most economical, to
get someone to lease one for you. There are, however,
several people who would willingly impart to you in-
struction in the drama for money, and if you are very
nicey-picey, doubtless many would be quite content to
be repaid with smiles. When “proficient,” you would be
nearly sure of an engagement, sinca there are so many
people playing here now, dear, and earning big salaries,
who never have been and never will be that. What
you want, however, is, we suppose, to attain immediate
lame. Then, here’s how to do it. Get the Eoyal
management (they are tons enfants ) to let you “ go on ”
as, say, a mute baroness ; then on the third night get
your young man to wait amongst the “mashers” in
the pit alley, and as yon come out, stab you with a
property carver. Wait till he has got away, and give
the nearest white-tied dandy in charge for the offence.
Your fame would be made then; for if you couldn’t
exactly get an engagement to star as Lady Macbeth,
you could knock out a very good thing by amalgamating
with the educated snakes, or accepting a sharing offer
to show with the stilts.

Regarding r the Montague-Turner Company.
“ Martha” was a complete performance. Mr. Turner
sang at his very best. Miss Montague sang as she
always sings—well. The rest of the characters were
good and the chorus excellent. In fact “ Martha" was
the best performance we have seen for a long time.
We went to see the “ Lily of Killarney,” on Monday
night. The first scene is pretty, and would be
be even splendid, if it were not for the memories of old
that are aroused by the sight of the aged and anachron-
istic plush and chintz coats of the Kerry gentlemen
assembled around the table. When we remember hav-
ing seen these garments in Spain, Italy, and the heart
of Germany, it is too much to meet with them again in
Kerry. Mr. Turner (HardressCregan) sang “A Bache-
lor’s Life” very finely. Some of his later songs were
sung even better. Miss Annie Montague (Eily O'Connor)
sang as beautifully ae ever. Her song in the cottage,
“I‘m alone," was a delicious piece of vocalization.
• # #
It was a cruel thing to cast Mr. Gainor for the
part of Danny Mann. Being very tall, and having to
make up as a paralysed hunchback, he succeeded in
giving people the impression that he was the “ burnt-
sienna” bicyclist. His voice also is hardly suited
to the part.
* • •
Mr. Percy Shannon’s (Myles na Coppaleen) per-
formance was an agreeable surprise to us. His song,
•* The Colleen Bawn," was encored. He may be said to
sing with more taste than voice. It is so rarely that
things fall out in this way—so hard to find a person
with taste having any voice at all, or a person with
voice having any taste — that we are very much obliged
to Mr. Percy Shannon for condescending to unite the
two qualities in his singing. His duet with Miss
Montague at the cottage-door was very well pulled
through. It was here that we were struck by the
ridiculousness that is evident in operatic performances
whenever one can forget the conventionalities and look,
as it were through a hole in the curtain, at things as
they are. In this duet the name of an old unshaven,
crooked-legged, broken-backed bog trotter is twisted
about, played upon, caught up, let down, caught up
again, and pulled out like a concertina, till one wonders
what in thunder all the fioriture is about. When you
discover that all this wealth of music is wasted upon
corkscrewing and spiralling such a patronymic as
Danny Mann, until they ” Da-a-ah-ne Mahn " into such
a shape that the owner would refuse to answer to it if
he heard it, you begin to think that this world is a very
foolish place, and that the only wise men living are in
lunatic asylums. Mr. Percy Shannon wore a curly wig
—which'appeared to be made of smoked pine shavings
—that almost smothered his pretty face. We were
sorry for this, because a thing of beauty is a joy for-
ever.
* * •
“ Fwhat the divel are ye movin’ that cloth
fur ?” yelled the only Irishman in the company—the
stage carpenter—from behind the scenes as he shunted
the Atlantic Ocean into the smugglers’ cave. This was
a cruel disillusionment. The setting of this scene
was very bad. Possibility was outraged in every way,
and, to crown all, the Colleen Biwn was fished up out
of the waiter after she had been under it long enough to
have drowned a whale.
* * #
Mr. Gordon made a good Father Tom ; played
well, sang well, and sucked his jug in a most life-like
manner. Miss Josephine Deakin (Miss Anne Chute)
sang in a style which, we regret to say, we can’t grow
enthusiastic over, though we are willing tossy that it
was tolerably good. Coldness is Miss Daakin’s fault.
In conclusion we may say that the company did not
perform this opera as well as they did “ Martha,"
** * *
After “ Patience,” “ The Masootte.” And
what’s the “ Mascot,te ?” Well, the “Mascotte” is a
nice girl who brings good luck wherever she goes, but
“If she loves whom she shall wed
Then the Mascotte’s pow’r is fled.”
The “Mascotte” is, by profession, o duck-driver, who
loves one Pippo, and the King of that country, being
disappointed in his many efforts to engage Lewis Scott
ns poet-laureate, gets her away from her employer,
Eocco (who had chartered her from Mrs. Hicks), and
makes her (the Congregational Church will frown at
this) a countess. Subsequently, Bettina —which is
French of Betsy (the Mascotte) —becomes a vivandiere
in tha King’s army, and her side wins until she marries
Pippo, and keeps a tobacconist's shop, whereupon the
King (who, d rectly she had departed, had begun to
back Trickett) goes broke, and all ends happily. This,
as the Evening News says, “is a mere outline of tha
plot."
• • *
Maggie Moore ia to be the Mascotte. Possibly
the public may remember this lady. She, we believe, has
occasionally performed the role of Lizzie Stofel in con-
junction with J. C. Williamson, who, we believe,
enacted the Dutch cobbler for a short season once a r .
Jamberoo. Directly after Miss Maggie has finished
with the opera, we trust she will lo k round at our
office, since, from the score we understand that —
“ Wher’e’er she goes troubles must fly.
And all that’s wrong she soon transposes;
Poor turn rich, the sickly are healed.
And deserts are blooming with roses.
“ Flocks will increase, harvests be full,
Trees with fruit earthwards be bending;
There’s naught but luck, good temper reigus—
’Tie she alone who your fortune is mending.”
The libretto is of rather a spicy sort, and the the cos-
tumes are to be the most magnificent ever seen in Syd-
ney—which is saying a good deal.
• • •
“The Mascotte” will be succeeded by the
pantomime, which is t® be called “The House that
Jack Built ” (presumably at Surry Hills), and will be
written this year, we understand, by the Eev. Mr.
Jefferies.
■* * * *
“ Romeo and Juliet ” at the Gaiety on Tuesday
night—Louise, Juliet; W. J. Holloway, Homeo. Shakes-
pearian drama is what wo like to see Bill iu We Hardly
know, however, whether Shakespeare would have liked
such a Borneo What a face, what a figure, and what
a voice to woo a gentle maiden under a balcony on
soma soft Italian night! Anybody else but Juliet
would have thought on hearing that voice that an
angel (we don't say, mind yon, what kind of an angel)
had strayed into the; garden ; but love is proverbially
blind. Yet her pertinent question, “Borneo, where-
fore art thou Eomeo ? ” was an evident staggerer to
her stout lover. Bill's Eomeo was, for all that, a great
study. His conception of the character was thoroughly
original When Louise plays “ Hamlet," Mr. W. J.
Holloway should play the part of Ophe.ia. We look
forward to this performance with much interest.
« * #
Miss Pomeroy’s Juliet was just the sort of
Juliet to suit such a Borneo, which doesn’t say whether
it was good or bad. We wait to see Louise in “ Hamlet,”
where she will really have scope for her undoubted
histrionic powers We were much affected—while we
were outside during the interval before the death-scene
—by seeing a small boy go in through the stage-door,
staggering under the weight of a “long-sleever." We
tried to entice him, by the promise of a tricycle and a
position on the staff of the Daily Telegraph, to lay
down his bucket and come and play with as. But that
boy was old, and had seen people of our sort before.
We were glad afterwards that we had not robbed him,
when we reflected that probably the jug of ale was for
somebody behind the scenes.
• * *
Mr. Arthur Elliott’s (Mercutio) performance
was far above the level of the acting of the rest of the
company. This gentleman is certainly the best actor
in the Pomeroy “ Dramatic Combination." Mr. K.
Bernard played Paris And such a Paris I If his name-
sake who gave Venus the apple had been anything
like him, she would have hit him in the eye
with it. Capulet (Mr. J. H. Costello) was the most
extraordinary-looking nobleman we have ever seen, and
we have seen Gussy before now. When he remarked,
“ I have seen a day when I could have worn a vizard,"
wo could have wept that that day was over. Miss
Kate Arden, fallen from her high estate of the pre-
ceding night, played the Nurse. What a moral is here I
What a satire upon the vicissitudes of life I Bah, let
na drink ! Miss Arden, we might remark, speaks in
exactly the same “ screamed pipe” fashion in this part
as in that of Dowager Countess of Chandooe. Friar
Laurence (Mr. Lachlan M’Qowan) was, next to Borne®,
one of the funniest characters in the play. He wore
all through a look of holy grumpiness that was
extremely edifying.
* * •
The scenery was badly handled. The side-
scenes were much mixed up. The edge of a primitive
forest was ranged up beside a cell-wall, the cell-wall cheek
bv jowl with a section of tha banquet hall. The tomb
of all the Capulots, with the name of that noble family
painted in bill-poster type on the top, looked like a fish-
shop on a small scale, or a booth in Paddy’s Market.
. • • •
? But Mr. Baylesa says the show was a very fine
one for all that, and as Mr. Bayliss has had a lot of
experience with shows of this sort, be ought to know.
It is rather hard to begin a paragraph about
“Patience" and be original. The word “evergreen,”
now the joint property of the Telegraph and Evehlng
News, is only associated with “ Maritana,” and to call
“Patience” “ever pleasing,” would be to court the
application of the editorial boot. Let us bluntly say,
then, that on Saturday night, at the Theatre Royal, we
were once more treated to this clever opera, and that it
was performed before every Sydney swell whose washing
had come home in time, and before everybody of fashion
whose marketing engagements allowed of her being
present. A fine house truly, and a grand circle. As
usual the front row was monopolized by the Chosen
People—a circumstance which caused a great many dis-
tinguished “persons” (including ourselves) to look very
hard at the stage when the curtain was up, and to
flatten themselves behind the public-house door when
the curtain was down. The management looked well
after the press, giving each moderately clean-looking
representative a seat all to himself, and a well-aired
playbill. Mr. Whitetie was regally enthroned as the
representative of the Tambaroora Boomerang, and the
“Prints of Wails,” gorgeous in hair-oil (the dais
not being quite completed) sat just in front.
We were not in our usual spirits when the
curtain rose, having failed in the object of letting our
opera glass, the usher (evidently a man of a small mind
and a protectionist) interposing some objections, in
which, we regret to say, he was supported by a man-
agement, who, as a rule, are celebrated [Two
columns of complimentary matter, and a sonnet to a
managerial eye-brow are here remorselessly excised.—

• • •
The improvement —for there is improvement
in the representation of the Opera, is of a paradoxical
kind. The second set, for instance, is a scene-picture
which it is now impossible to improve upon. Like the
black Tom’s fifth leg in the cat-shew, this alone is worth
more than the price charged for admission. Alice Rees
has gone, and Nellie Stewart has succeeded her. Well,
Nellie Stewart, for picturesqueness, could not be sur-
passed by anything that didn’t oome from where the
Salvation Army’s “ Jolly Old Man,” is credited to have
gone “in a fiery van." She is a picture out of a frame
—a figure off a 10-guinea pie-plate. And she can sing
too, charmingly; but she can’t sing better than Alice
Bees, yet. No, not by a whole team and a big dog—under
the waggon. Riecardi’s place—the Colonel—is taken
by Mr. Drayton, who can’t sing much better than the
gallant Calverly’s former representative; and Armes
Beaumont is succeeded by Mr. Harrison, from London,
who, if he ever sings worse than Beaumont did, will
probably be killed. He has a niceish voice, has Mr.
Harrison, but there is a timbre about it at times, which
seems to point to the conclusion that in early youth he
may possibly have swallowed a sardine tin.
* • *
Madame Navaro has elaborated her Lady Jane,
hnt the only improvement we see in it now, is that when
singing she doesn't put out the man who played the
drum. There were two drummers, who ns ad to play
alternate nights, when “ Patience” was on last time.but
they both died, their remains being followed to the
Necropolis by a solitary mourning-coach containing the
author of their decease, and Jos Goodman, with a hat-
hand round his biceps. Vernon is as delightful as ever,
and Verdi as beautiful as he used to be. Edwin Kelly,
onr first High Admiral, was the Major, and Lady
Angela was enacted by Miss Ida Osborne, whom
we know not, bnt who we believe was recently under-
studying Patti when she sang her Dubbo season.
Giorza conducted, and the opera went gloriously. Thus
“ Patience.”
Mr. J. H. Want.
Our front-page portrait is that of Mr. J. H

that Mr. Want will have lots of “ wholesome
fun,” and are confident that few men will in the
old country better represent Australian manliness
than the eminent yachtsman, “ Jack” Want.

Mining in New South Wales is, probably, on a
sounder footing now than it ever was before. We are
glad to learn that Newton’s freehold at the Forest
Beefs is to be worked on a large scale. A company has
been formed by Mr. 0, J. Auckland with a capital of
£55,000 in 110.000 shares of 10s. each. Stone treated in
balk at the Melbourne Mint gave 437 ounces of gold to
the ton.
Huge investments are every day binding the
colonies together. The biggest thing yet announced is
the Worth Queensland Mining Investment Company,
whose prospectus will be published in a few days.
The company is formed for the purpose of purchasing
several large dividend-paying claims at Charters
Towers and elsewhere, and placing them under one
management for the purpose of economy. Several
leading men in each colony are identifying themselves
with the project.
The other day, the Queensland Evangelical
Standard stated that efforts were being made to engage
natives of New Guinea as labourers on Queensland
plantations. Mr. Brookes drew attention to the matter
in the House, and quoted a letter received from a mis-
sionary in substantiation of the charge. The Premier
in reply said he never read the Evangelical Standard,
and cautioned Mr. Brookes against receiving the state-
meats of missionaries from the South Seas, as from his
(the Premier’s) experience as Colonial Secretary he had
found that they told such a heap of lies as to disgust
him.
If there is one subject more powerful than
another to drag the Ciceronio eloquence out of a
cricketer’s 4-oz. soul it is that of “ The Ladies.” At
Newtown, the other night, there was a social splurge,
and a popular leather-hunter having filled himself up to
the ears with ginger-beer, let out as follows: —“ As I
arose to speak this evening 1 picked np a piece of papah
on which was written * Premeditate thy words.' I have
not done so, but I am shnah the ladies—those adorable,
angelical creechaws —will not mind that. Cricketers,
above all others, should love the ladies, because crick,
eters wear white shirts and collars and pants, and who-
I indignantly ask would scrub those pants if there were
bo ladies ? With these few remarks, I will now call for
three cheers for lovely woman.” The talented speaker
then sat down on a baldfaoed tart, and someone happen-
ing to wake the loader of the band by opening a bottle
Of “ Dunville ” close to his ear, his gang at once blasted
out “For they are jolly good fer-el-lows—and so say all
of us." Toasting the ladies is now such a popular
institution with our chivalrous athletes that many of
them tie cold coffee round their heads and consume the
midnight oil in their wild endeavours to brow a senti-
mental speech worth recording. Perhaps the most
sincere, if not the most truthful, oration on this sac-
charine subject was recently delivered by Tommy Horan,
who, being slightly under cometic influence at the time,
observed : ” Gentlemen, let us drink to lovely woman—
the morning-star of onr infancy, the day-star of onr
manhood, and the evening-star of our old age. Bless
our stars, and may they always keep at telescopic dis-
tance from ns." Tommy has evidently been jilted by
the “Jersey Lily,” or disagreeably disappointed by th«
ady who manipulates bis washing.
Last night, just after we had said
Our customary prayers.
And covered up our classic head.
And wondered if the stairs
Would echo in the morning to
The footfall of the dun,
And whether he would be a new
Or else the old, old one,
We saw with living eyes a ghost—
The winds were very still—
That shoot our souls up as, almost,
A match-boy shakes a till.
Our lips with grim and ghastly fears
Were both together glued.
It was the ghost of—ah, ye tears !
The last coin we had “blued.”
It had a bald and aged look,
A look of holy woe—
We parted it to hear Joe Cook
About a week ago.
The phantom slowly darkwards slipped.
The night went by, and then
We sprang up out of bed and gripped
Our stylographic pen
And sat down as you see us now.
With set and steady scowl,
Resolved to earn some coin somehow
Though heaven and earth should howl.
The landlady came in quite mad
As we turned that last verse.
And from her words we guessed she had
Designs upon our purse.
At which we simply turned around.
And with a glare we froze
That landlady, and grimly frowned
And ground on at the “ Shows.”


PEPPER AND SALT.
Head this. It was a beautiful girl, passing rich,
but of delicate appearance. It was also a literary man
of superior attainments, and of "good address,” —and
they loved one another. Everything was fixed for the
wedding, whan about a fortnight before the ceremony,
the groom-elect was told oft by his paper for a special
duty. Abuses were reported to exist at Glebe Island,
and he was told to hie him there in the grey of early
morn and report upon them. He journeyed thither in
due course, and on his return wrote to his lady-love
emphatically breaking off the engagement. The father
of the girl came to him twirling a big stick for an ex-
planation. Ho declined giving one. Then the brother
waited upon him with a tomahawk. But though the
brother axed him, he male no reply. The affair was a
nine days’ wonder, but in due course the Milburn Creek
business and the hat trick caused the affair to fade from
the minds of all except the parties directly inter,
ested. We, of course, wondered ; but with our usual
discretion, said nothing. A few days ago, however,
while dining at a popular hostelrie at the same table
with the journalist, we observed that, as he took his
departure, be dropped a couple of slips of paper while
putting up his pocket-book. He was gone before we
could restore them, and observing' that what he had
left behind was onlv “ copy,” we ventured to peruse it.
It had no heading, but there was an editorial memo,
crowded into a turned corner, saying :— *• Effective but
too repulsive.” What we could make out was to this
effect:—“ I stood with my Mentor, a retail butcher, in
the shadow of a doorway and watched as directed.
Presently a handsome Victoria drove up within a few
yards of the place, and a well-known statesman alighted,
went into the slaughter-house, and after a few moments’
absence returned, and was driven rapidly away. The
next comer was a young and beautiful lady in a dashing
brougham, who ” . . The slip was mutilated here, but

There was recently much excitement in Canada.
f plot had been discovered for carrying oil the Prin-
ts Louise. Directly the Toronto Town Council
v ird of this, they caused the Town Clerk to be armed
ith a pike, and voted the Mayor a pair of ironclad
tusers. Then, telling the constabulary to don his top
; its, and the beadle—the other representative of Her
'•T.ijesty—to see to the mobilization of the day-scholars,
e aldermen trooped up to Government House, and
r t esented a loyal address. The Marquis of Lome, hav-
ig swallowed the testimonial, and the aldermen, having
got down some nice Vice-regal “sherry wine” (im-
>rted especially for that purpose), the loyal body
tparted, and the Governor-Qeneral sat down to think,
hen, rising hastily, he issued a ukase that no English
ergymen wore to be allowed to land, and inveigling
onisa into the pantry, turned the key on her. Three
ays later —daring which the Marquis systematically
ua veiled the mail-bag—the happy pair left for British
< lolnmbia. Prior to embarking, the Princess reported
he existence of an infernal machine on board the boat,
out nothing in a white choker being discovered. His
Excellency smiled ironically and told the captain, in a
savage voice, to “ shove her off.” Since this, the
Marquis and Marchioness have been continuing their
tour, both, as a London crawler observes, “highly
benefiting fey the change of air and of scene, and the
absence of restraint imposed by official duties.”
It was on a blowy afternoon last week that a
elderly female, carrying one baby and leading another,
was waiting for the tram in Elizabeth-street, strag-
gling the while with a number of small parcels of
grocery, and holding her ticket desperately between
her teeth. Suddenly the tram and a fierce gust ar-
rived simultaneously. It was the high-toned Woollahra
one too, full of the noblesse of the counter and spigot.
The old dame made a wild rush forward, when the child
she was leading tripped, and in her efforts to save it,
the mother let go a two-pound bag of fleur she was
carrying. Then arose a howl the like of which has not
been heard since Young Loftns trod on Dooley’s corn
at the 1 Band wick races, and the last glimpse that was
caught of the cars as they moved on disclosed 250 ladies
shaking their skirts on to the gentlemen, and one mem-
ber of the legal profession making a vain effort te comb
the powder out of a two-foot beard with fingers that
would have been three sizes too largo for a glover’s
clump.

“ Australienne,” that weird antipodean muse,
has written a “ poem," printed in the Presbyterian
"on the burning of the Sydney Garden Palace.” Here
are two verses:—
“ The crowds of people gaze
In silent awe and fear.
And the sea laughs rippling on in the bays,
As pure and as fresh and as clear.
“ Father, we know not now.
Why Thou hast let this be;
But it is not ours to ask why or how.
But simply to trust in Thee.”
We feel that it is almost sacrilege to suggest an altera-
tion in the lines of the pious poetess, but our reverence
for common sense is too strong for our veneration for
religious rag-patchwork to let the opportunity pass.
How will these do ?
Six sad subscribers gaze
Upon those verses drear,
Andjthen go raving on their ways,
And drown their woes in beer.
Father, we wonder how
The devil it can be
That people print such blanked pow-wow.
And call it “ poetry.”

A London paper remarks that at Constantinople,
Mrs. Baker Pasha founded a Donkey-Protection Asso-
ciation. One day Sir Henry Layard happening to be
summoned to the Palace was acquainted with this fact
by the Sultan. “ Mrs. Baker’s aim is a laudable one.
But it is unnecessary to some extent. For instance—
Your Majesty is already well looked after.” Next day
the Ambassador was recalled at the instance of the
Ottoman Porte. [Hang it! Letting a big State secret
loose like this, and only charging 3d. a copy !— Ed. B ]
When the Royal Yacht, with Cetewayo and his
Court, arrived at Cowes en route for Osborne, it being
earlier than was expected, no royal carriages were in
waiting to convey the Zulus to Osborne House. The
King, therefore, got out on to the beach, and he and
his chiefs played a little game. It was a simple pas-
time, the only paraphernal a required being the shingle
provided by Nature. His Majesty squatted down in a
heap, and called his followers to form a half-circle in
front of him. Then he threw pebbles at them as hard
as he could. If Be hit a warrior it counted one to him,
and if ho missed, nobody counted any; so he had a very
good show of winning. On entering the Palace, His
Majesty appeared much struck with the Queen’s foot-
men, and expressed a wish to shake hands with these
menials, being under the impression that they ware the
Ministry. The conversation was carried on through
an interpreter, and was of a most intellectual kind.
Here is a chunk of it: —Queen: How do you like our
country ? Cetewayo : Why, in thunder, did yon steal
my bullocks and put me in gaol, confound you P
I Interpreted— He is delighted and charmed with the
graoiousness of your Majesty’s reception.) Queen:
We trust the house we have provided suits yeu.
Cetewayo: I owe you one for bursting up my best
kraal. What (pointing to John Brown) the deuce is
that snuff-shop Highlander ? Is it alive ? ( Interpreted
—He, in gratitude, kisses the hem of your Majesty’s
garments.) Queen : What is there we can do for you,
Cetewayo ? Cetewayo :Do 1 give me back my selection
—and all the pigs your soldiers ate. Oh, and look!
I’ve dropped down to this “ have.” Let’s see the real
Queen—the one there’s the picture of in my medicine
almanac! Here further disguise was useless, so the
signal was given to the beef-eaters, and the monarch
and his followers were hustled down the kitchen stair-
case, and out through the back yard into the street.

H. F. Nathan, of Christchurch (or, rather,
anti-Christchurch, for he’s a Jew, and it wasn’t in a
Christchurch at all, but in a synagogue), persisted in
sticking to a pew that wasn’t his’n. But on the festival
of New Tear 116,750,786 years from the Nebular period,
Mr. Harris, the president, and other Chosens bundled
him out—the police refusing to interfere. He sum-
moned the chief rulers, and was non-suited, with costs.
Said Hagag Nathan, “ S’help me life,
I’m going to sit down here.”
Said Moses Harris, “ Save us strife,
And do for God’s sake clear."
The beaky Hagag answered “ Nay.”
But, when before the beak,
He found that ’twasn’t Mo to pay,
But Hagag, for his cheek."

Cetawajo left England full of plans for the re-
organization of his army, and the civilization of his
people. Before clearing, he instructed a person to
prepare a number of patents of nobility, and also to
order a largo consignment of metal head-dresses, for his
warriors. Both orders have been delivered ; but as the
individual in whom the King reposed confidence has
turned out to be of a waggish nature, as well as of a
speculative disposition, the effect of the consignments
has been to vastly entertain all strangers within the
Zulu’s gates. Amongst his nobles now number (Em-
peror Soulouque fashion).the Duke of Qingerbeer, Lord
Portergaff, the M arquis of Lemonkali, Viscount Bum
and-Milk, and other titles of an equally facetious nature,
while, as the head-dresses of the warriors have been
ehosen from the tin-plates of disused provision boxes,
the inscriptions upon their martial brows read as follow;
—“Sardines, Leroux and Co.”, “Superfine Raisins,"
“ First-class Lobsters," “ Prime Dried Codfish,” etc.,
to the supreme delectation of all civilized beholders.

A Herberton paper that announced the spearing
of a man to death by the blacks last week, now says : —
" The concluding sentence of the paragraph [about
civilizing tho blacks, noticed by ns in “Pepper and
Salt ”] in our last issue, under this heading, has happily
turned out to be incorrect, inasmuch as the man speared
is alive and hearty, and not numbered with the dead,
having sustained no further injury than being pierced
three inches in the calf of the leg.”
A leg that’s pierced three inches through—
That is a paltry thing !

A lot of blacks had been shearing at a
station near Warangesda—the Grot of the Godly
Gribble—to which they belonged, when a hawker
arrived on the scene, and invited them to
make purchases, knowing that they had
earned some money. This the dusky children did,
and in a little while the ebon children of Christianity
were bedecked in all the glories of coloured belts, silk
neck-handkerchiefs, and other ornaments, the Crimean
shirts and moleskin trousers not being in much
demand. After they had been supplied, the tradesman
drew them out orders ®n the squatter for their various
amounts, and off they went whooping through the
bush. On applying at the station, however, he was
informed that they had all been paid, and at the time
he sold the monarchs of the forest the things, they had
their cheques in their pockets—or wherever they put
them. Hastening in search of these brown-skinned
hymn-chanters, he requested an explanation or the
money. “ Oh, baal shillin’ 1” [cried the spokesman ;

A question agitating the Tamworth mind is
whether the jurors’ luncheon should always be ordered
in from one hotel, or whether the others shouldn't have
a show. It arose from the frequency of “ Guilty" ver-
dicts of late, and it is thought a little variety in the
hash trough might give an innocent man a show when
on trial for his life. No pure-minded juror can return
a verdict on the evidence, when he is dying to get out
to a pub. and lay the torments of tough neck-chops.
“No just verdicts, your Honor, until a 32-course is
sent in,” says the foreman.
This is the tmth, the whole truth, and

Some time ago the telegraph Master in a cer-
tain Western township received a most impor-
tant telegram for a squatter, respecting the
state of the Sjdney cattle market. Going
out to deliver the same, the lightning dodger
was filled with “ a soot prise that bor-dur-red on
indig-nashun ** (as the only orator now alive
would say) on observing that the contents of
the message he carried were scratched in large
letters on the sand in front of his office. Not
being a Spiritualist, or any other kind of foo 1 ,
at tho time, he poked about on earth for an
explanation, and very soon obtained it. The
person next door was an old telegraphist, and
as the instrument in use was erected near
the front window, he had only to stand close
to read every word by sound that passed
along that line. This is a little matter con-
nected with the fittings of our Telegraph Offices
which evidently wants reforming. In almost
every case the recording instruments are placed
where their sound can be distinctly heard at
the receiving counter, and in some cases even
in the street. Now, there are quite a number of
persons in this colony who at one time were
telegraphic experts, either here or in America,
and there is nothing in this, or any world, to
prevent their standing on the footpaths in front
of our offices, and copying off the whole of what
is innocently supposed to be a business kept as
strictly secret as the Pope’s confessional. Even
tho head office can be tampered with in a similar
way. Any unscrupulous person who knows the
ropes has simply to concoct a “bogus” c«m.
plaint, and he is at once ushered into the operat-
ing room, where he can stand about, and per-
has pick up information enough to fleece the
poor unsuspecting little bookmaker of several
thousand pounds.
Liberality may be overdone. That is what a
Lachlan squatter said the other day, when, on ad-
journing with his family for a holiday *• spree” to the
metropolis, he feelingly suggested to the mother of one
of his servants that she ought to pay her daughter’s
fare up.
The other day, at a Sandhurst meeting, a vote
of thanks was proposed to Alderman Knight, for per-
forming a certain ceremony. The proposer added that
be would “liko to embrace the Alderman’s wife also.”
The worthy orator had te explain that his meaning was
to “include” that lady’s name in the toast.
The strongest rum known is sold on the Lands-

Considerable excitement, and

was recently caused at a marriage

through the newjy.arrived Bridget
mistaking a packet of Epsom salts

the flonr-doings were finished and

green, and then, with a sickly
smile on her face, she Iretired to

bridegroom might be seen holding
up the back fence, whilst the fes-
tive guests were lying about the
yard in the most promiscuous man-
ner possible, calling on the wood,

down and bury them, and cursing

Mr. J. H. Clayton, editor of a N.Z. paper

A gentleman writes from Newcastle: —“ Sir, —
As .you are generally admitted to be a gentleman of
very superior knowledge and an entirely disinterested
Party, will you have the goodness to enlighten me on
this very important sabjeot. A man who dies out-

state ? or does his soul neither possess brains or sub-
stance of any kind ? If so, then what is it ?• By describ-
ing it to me I shall ever feel grateful to you, as I am
always glad to receive information.” We have probed
this matter to the bottom. His soul, under tbe cir.
cnmstanoes, transmigrates into the body of a still mad-
der person, and he straightway gets the editorship of a

Water on such a crass creation 1
A Rockhampton merchant, the other day, was
pharged with selling less than two gallons of whisky.
The proof brought by the Inspector of Distilleries was
arum one. He stated that tue defendant did no r . get
drunk on tho quantity purchased, and did not dispose
of it in any way other than down his throat, conse-
quently it must have been less than two gallons. The
magistrate allowed that this was strong evidence, but
admitted that he could get drunk on lass himself—if it
were properly fixed up with cayenne-pepper and kero-
sene—and dismissed the case.
Some years ago a certain learned member of the
Tasmanian House of Assembly was strongly addicted to
extensive classical quotations. On one occasion, in
reply to an attack he wound up with an appropriate
selection from a Latin author, and, pointing to his
vigorous, but illiterate opponent, sneerirgly suggested
that he would allow him the honour of translating it
to the House. His antagonist coolly rose and said,
“ Well, Mr. Speaker, as far as I cap make out, the
honourable member wanted to say to the House.
There's no blank flies about me; only ho didn't like
to put it in plain English !’* There were no more
classical quotations that evening.
In a late issue, the London Daily News
took considerable pains to impress nppn its readers the
terribly arduous nature ol the duties of our “ Mr.
Wales,” acd the self-sacrificing manner in which he
bravely struggles through them. The par. is headed,
“ A Hard Day’s Work,” and this is what the martyred
hero did“ In the afternoon of Saturday last,
besides holding a levee, he unveiled the statue of Sir
Rowland Hill at Cornhill, and in the evening he dined
with the Lord Mayor and the provincial’Mayors at the
Mansion House, afterwards witnessing part of the per-
formance of ‘The Marriage of Figaro* at Covent
Garden." The fearful drudgery of putting oneself
outside of a Lord Mayor’s feed is bad enough, but when
it has to be followed np by an evening in ithe
Covent Qarden Theatre, one naturally wonders why
Albert Edward doesn’t throw up his billet and take to
the coal-heaver’s business, or anything else not quite so
fatiguing as eating roast pheasants and gazing for
hours at the naughty niceties of an opera ballet.
A good many of the several people who have
read the Victorian Review consider it to be rather a
heavy production. Now, this passage, for instance,
weighs a considerable deal. Read itUnder the
head of * Accumulation.’ in the statistics published by
Mr. H. H. Hayter fer 1881, that gentleman shows how
every pound earned in Victoria is spent, both by
bachelors and married men. For the purposes of the
present article we may disregard the statistics affecting
the bachelors, and take those only regarding the mar-
ried’’ Well, ladies and gentlemen, this bit is not from
the Victorian Review at all. It is from Melbourne

There’s a paper in Christchurch called Society,
which, up to the present time, has been chiefly remark-
able for the peculiar baldness of its style, and the cheer-

into prominent notice at last 9 seemingly, by punching
a local draper who tried to horsewhip him in the
street. On the week following the fracas, a cartoon
appeared in the *aper, and also some verses written
avowedly by their “funny man/' who, it seems, was

power which would do credit to an Aztec, and the

Not long tiace, certain natives
belonging to a Weslejan mission
station in Auckland prjvince, N.Z.,
determined on conducting a
funeral on economical principles
For this purpose they got »n
ordinary shoe-trunk, and placed
the body in it. However, there was
one obstacle to the success of the
scheme —the knees of deceased
persis'ei in sticking up, and ;pre-
vented the closing of the lid.
However, just as the natives des-
paired of Being able to shut the
box, a happy thought struck an
old hag, who jumped on the box
and got them to lock it while she
stood on the lid. One day a native
on the tame station informed one
of the missionaries that the Maoris
had g-t a monster; concealed on
the settlement, whereupon the
rev gentleman coolly remarked—
Wo inosc have this monster’s
blood." After coi siderable search
the monster was dragged from its
hiding place, and turned ont to bo

ary having, it teems, taught the

Up in North Queensland, recently, a store-
keeper died. His sou's wedding happened to have been
fixed for the following day; but, of course, everyone
expected that the marriage would be put off, for a time
at least. The deceased was buried on a Monday, the
day fixed for the wedding; but, contrary to antioips-
tion, the dutiful and s crowing son went to the parson
on his return from the funeral, and requested him to
tie the knot. The rev. gentleman refused, on the scere
that he had read the funeral service that day. Then
the young man, who seemed to like misfortune, and
was determined to acquire a wife on the same day that
he lost his father, went to the local E C priest, and
asked him it he would perform, An. The priest de-
clined, remarking that neither of the pair was a
member of the “ One True Church." " Well, ’ ejacn-
lated the bridegroom-expectant, ** I did think you were
a man, but you’re only an adjective thing." Next day
the pair cleared out by steamer for (say) Townsville,
where they ceased to be two and became one.
This is a “ rummynisance ” of the good old
days of bushranging. A travelling hawker, who was
the lawful owner of a lilted cart packed with all the
necessaries of station life, such as plug tobacco, dia-
mond studs, and German concertinas, was once rounded
up by Ben Hall’s gang, near Cowra, and after the
knights of the road had put him through, and departed
with the "turn-out " and all it contained, the pedlar’s
wife crept softly up and inform e l her sorrowing spouse
she had managed to plant twenty £5-notes from the
robbers’ gaze. 11 How in thunder did.yon do that?
asked the astonished man 44 I stuck them there in my
bustle," joyfully replied the lady—and then she placed
herself in a position to enable her lord to her to
his grateful breast, and sob •• Bar-lessyou, my own dear
girl—ber-less yon ” Instead of doing the George
Darrell biz , however, the fellojv turned savagaly round
and roared "Why. you good-for-nothing, jumped no,
wall-eyed, broken-lagged, contaminated old ass, why
diin’t you stick the horse and cart there also ?”

Another new paper. This time the Glebe
.... Observer This journal is established, of
course, to supply a long-felt want, and is remarkable
for containing a leading article—" Ourselves ’’—which
appears to have been written enfre deux vins by a gentle-
man with a very large fund of oircus-wheezes. The
first number contains an enormous quantity of read-
ing-matter, amongst which are some " Bubbles from
the Cauldron,” by “Vid ," who owes his position on
the staff down there, possibly, to the influence of the
last religious editor who died. What we miss in this
paper, however, is the usual recipe for " collared head,"
and the little report about the presentation of a leather,
mounted tooth-brush to our esteemed townsman Mr.
Jobling. The Glebe . . . Observer is very nicely
printed, and when the gifted editor has belaboured the
Esquimaux with a railway sleeper to improve his read-
ing the journal ought to be popular in its district —

of the kind, of course, and if he did, does not his
exalted position give him, in a great measure, the right
to look down upon the humble journa'ist? Besides,
supposing Thady’s account to he true, Sir Arthur
only reversed the ordinary order of things with squat-
ters and other big people—which is to lubricate th#

and innumerable banners waving from a oorresponning

glee and clean linen, and the comps, at the local news-

found himself for the first time in those wilds; 44 is it
a cricketer’s birthday, or has somebody slaughtered the

reply. 41 Can the local cobbler have won the J.unberoo

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO I.
I.
O ye, with hearts unatrickea by disaster.
Who never weep, and —hardly ever—sin;
O ye, whose souls are, unto alabaster.
As Baker’s conscience to an Ethiop’s skin ;
Whose principles are strong as Town Hall plaster.
Or Tork-street language, or Condoblin gin;
Whoso lives are paragons, whose deaths transitions,
■ Unto the realms that lighted Milton’s visions—
ii.
O tender women, to this world betrothed,
Who live your Uvea and have no other care,
Who, bountifully fed and brightly clothed.
Love back sweet love, and still have ample share;
Yet pass your sisters, trampled down and loathed.
With quickened step and half-averted stare,
To whom this life its choicest dish uncovers.
Piled to the top with husbands, hats, and lovers—
in.
O sturdy men, who in the lowliest stations,
Toil on to bulwark this great country’s name ;
Who, happy on a pound a week and rations.
Scarce nurse a thought to fly for higher game,
Bearing on patient backs the thin relations
Of bulky statesmen. Men, awake and tame,
Who know your strength, yet are too dull to rear a
Fierce buck and shed such human Phylloxera —
IV.
O strident, blaring, red-proboscised soakers,
Who pump out platitudes in our Domain ;
0, mincing Parsons, white in swan-white chokers.
Who lisp against the devil and Tom Paine I
0, phalanxed shoal of sanctimonious jokers.
Who ** never naming God except for gain,”
Wear, Deacon-Skinner-like, the mask Religion
To hide the falcon from the fated pigeon—
v.
0, tetchy squabblers about mere expression.
Who fret your poky little souls with doubt;
Who write about the Westminster Confession,
For lack of anything to write about;
Whose ghastly English would make creep the flesh on
A C.M.G —who daily worry out
The Church’s dogmas, as a dog might worry,
Recruoifying Christ —and Liudloy Murray—
VI.
And yo who strive to make men’s burdens lighter.
Who tight with darkness, groping for the light.
Give ear with these unto a new-ohum writer,
And ponder well the story he will write.
A tale of truth, although at times he might err.
As human writers must at times get tight.
With sufferance the badge of all his tribe,
Who should hold rum like the unhappy scribe ?
VII.
Dear ang'la, turn awhile from fins and ribbons.
Dear statesmen, rest upon your country’s wheel.
Dear lamb-like Vaughans, Chiniquys, M‘Gibbons,
Chuok up your cards and let ms have a deal.
Dsar doughty Templars, cease your secret bibbings
And plunge in sheath your thirsty temperance steel,
Give me severe attention, all and sundry.
From Yorke’s Peninsula to—to— Bjolhundrie.
VIII.
Lord Loftus, please release that wretched bantam,
Nor cluck in hopefulness about your yard.
(The Bulletin ere this has given you quantum.
So on that subjact I won’t lean too hard.)
John Davies, tremble not as at a phantom
To mark the dibut of a Popish bard :
If ha should smite you, and with blows not weak,
Just turn your other comprehensive cheek.
ix.
Q. D , go slowly—take a spell and fatten.
And give this land a chance to do the same ;
Jack M'Elhone, thou cross ’twixt Pitt and Grattan,
Forget awhile the Coonanbara’s name.
Ye out-door polemics, lot up on Satan,
And steady down from everlasting flame ;
And you, John Lucas, listen here, or go to
The —never mind, I’ll write it mildly—Pluto.
x.
Sir ’Enery Parkas (thou too hast wooed the siren.
Boar witness O ye *• Murmurs of the Stream ”),
Thou Grand Old Man, below whose brow of iron.

Who ne’er was lauded by the Sundown Scream.
Unscrew the harp thou canst attune so sweetly,
Lest my poor muse be boosted up completely.

Australian hills o’erlooked Australian valleys.
And all the scenery was quite Australian —
Dark trees were ranged behind the rustic palace.
Which at that time my heroine lived gaily in.
A lovely maid, whose bosom was a chalice
Of all the virtues to which mine is alien.
(What grace or worth, think you, could go where I go,
Who just eluded being born in taligo.)
XII.
It was a tenement not high aul splendid,
Bat small and rough and marvellously clean.
Whose walls were slab, most dexterously blended
With padelfb clay to stop the gaps between.
The root of »■.. ogles visibly was mended
With shi .ia< squares that spoke of kerosene;
Outside t .j garden-fence were ploughs and harrows,
And inside—chiefly vegetable-marrows.

To me. Sir Jack :—" This picture’s gory pleasant.
This is a crimson bona fide case.
This is the humpy ot a b peasant,
Look at his Deity-ignited maize

And yet the papers—d n and blank and space
Their rasa-huel optics—must come in and cripple us
With that d d story about Erysipelas."
xiv.
True, guileless greybeard. In the far-off future
Of this muoh-suavelled country, men will say
That when the land shark hungered for his loot, your
Invulnerable Land Act barred the way.
Nailed (like Achilles in a Goulcurn boot), your
Inviolable measure spread dismay
Among the Members, middlemen, and plotters.
Who sought to help the much-defrauded f quatters.
sv.
Beyond the house you saw the whole selection
(Two hundred acres it was—more or less)
Green with a crop which had the frail protection
A dog-leg fence affords. (You’d never guess.
Dear reader, seated at a choice refection.
In all the negligence of morning dress,
The anguish of a man who first commences
To wrestle with this forlorn-hope of fences.)
XVI.
He gets his bottom log set up on two bits
Of upright timber, and he digs four holes.
And then he grabs a log of many cubits
And tries to lift it betwixt four crossed poles.
And, gauging well the thing he has to do, spits
On both his bands, and tightens up his moles.
Then lifts the light end in, then find# the butt’s out.
Then all the lot comes down, and jams his guts out.)
XVII,
Daad trass amid the wheat stood white and ghostly.
And black sued stamps their stnnted forms npreared.
The timber thereabout was ringbarked mostly.
Some years before the cockatoo appeared ;
And as the settler found it rather costly
To have it even moderately cleared,
He let it be, and garnered in his sheaves
Diluted largely with dead twigs and leaves.
XVIII.
Now for the inside. I feel scarcely able
To do this subject justice—but here goes;
A glorious maiden seated at a table.
Her cheek a caution to the rosiest rose
That ever mingled in Arabian fable,
With genie’s marvels and true lover’s woes.
(I’ve often told my present Missus since. I
Thought nothing of that dowdy thing in wincey.)
XIX,
A hybrid doe—not high-bred, please—is lying
Unon the floor before the damsel's feet.
Largely alert and vigilantly eying
An eh an bucket, wherein boHs the meat —
Corned in a manner, there is no denying,
Aliae by salt and bv the weary sweat
Of the poor wretch who tills the soil for bread
And gats it —outside, cinder j inside, lead.
xx.
I don't insinuate that Jenny’s baking
Was less a thing of Heaven than herself,
So, this point settled, while she sits there making
A Town and Country trimming for a shelf,
We’ll loon around, brief inventory taking
Of billies, dippers, culinary delf.
Flat irons, and a patent nutmeg-grater.
Whose use was secret to the Great Creator.
XXI.
Fresh white-washed walls, with no attempt at ceiling
But rafters, from which hnng a goodly row _
Of bush-grown hams —a curtained door revealing
In grudging glimpse, a counterpane of snow,
A pair of bluchers, much in want of heeling.
Set near a dish that held fermenting dough
Upon a floor, innocent of hoarding,
And—really nothing else worth while recording.

SAMPLING THE SCULLERS.
Ib’a a very nice thinpr to be on the Press. Nicer,
almost, than anythin)? we know—except keeping an
oyster shop or training the ballet. Once you are
recognized as belonging to a paper, your privileges
commence immediately. Men wait to bntton-hole you
for pars, at one end of the street, and dissatisfied indi-
viduals attend on yon with bludgeons at the other.
Ladies waylay yon, and denounce their husbands in
shopping thoroughfares which are haunted by the girl
you adore, and you are, in consequence, cnt mercilessly
by her and denounced by the husbands aforesaid, who
are pressing in their queries “ if you want anything for
yourself” in friend.frequented hostelriea. The moat
glorious of your privileges is, perhaps, that you oan go
in for nothing any night the Parliamentary pitch is on
and sit over the Speaker. We went there one evening
in clean socks and well-burnished bluchers, and, haying
looked timidly around on the assembled Juniuses, we
went into a room at the back, and, humbly bowing to a
leaden-visaged young man who was wearily transcribing
shorthand notes, we proceeded to lay our umbrella on
a sofa, prior to collecting material for a sketch which
should paralyza the universe. Having, when near the
door, pulled our hair to the young man, he looked np
and said : “Er—l say—er—'l’von kaow this room be-
longs to The Herald ?” “What Herald?” wa en-
quired respectfudy. “ Toe Stdnet Moeniso Hekald,
said he. ‘•Never heard of it," we replied. Then, as an
afterthought, “It is probably a medical journal ?' On
this, the young man darted towards us such a look of
deadly horror, that, gathering up our property, we
elided into the next compartment. There was no sofa
here, only a gentleman with a short dark beard and
two foreheads—one at the front, and one at the hack <nf
his head. Wa stood our umbrella up in the corner of
the room, and were about to make a jsoular remark
anent the appetising odour of saveloys prevalent, when
the dual-foreheaded party said : “ Yon may not bo
aware of it, sir, but this apirtment is sacred to The
News." At this awful intelligence we turned deathly
pale, and, falling on onr knees before our umbrella,
offered up a heartfelt prayer for its safety. Then,
kicking aside a shoe-solo and a block-tin shirt-cuff
which lay upon the floor, wa passed out into the
gaUery. # , ,
Bat where the journalist also shines is at the
theatre. When he enters the front he does so with a
majestic step, conscious that he represents a paper
which gives the straight griffin to Governors, and makes
mincemeat of Members. He marches proudly to his
seat, and, finding a lady in it, requests the usher to
place her elsewhere. She goes, expressing surprise m
audible tones that the bellman is allowed in t he dress-
cirole; a--id later in the evening her “gentleman,
friend” requests you to furnish him with thenumbsrof
vonr ward in the model lodging-house, in order that a
friend of his may call and kick you for him on the
morrow Behind the scenes, however, the scribe is in
great glory. Pretty actresses trip over to you at the
wings, and, smiling divinely, hand you a packet ©f MS.
weighing something under 201 b , and whisper you it is
« a trifle " they would hko “ puc in the paper,” Anxious
to oblige, you hand the biography (which is in several
chapters) to your editor, who, no sooner has he read,
“Born of parents whose position in the dramatic pro-
fession was unchallenged,” pitches the copy in the
grate, and assaults you with the flie-ahoyel. The paper
comes out in due course, and the “trifle" not being
inserted, a cavalier avenger of pretty females’ wrongs
sits twelve hours out ©t the twenty-four on your office
step, switching a brand new horsewhip—a proceeding
on bis part which necessitates your climbing into y®nr
office at daybreak, and writing all your flne-ort notices
on the hill-board in the machine-room.

But the Press has its sweets as well as its
sorrows. Occasionally writers are, by men of more
than ordinary culture and intellectual attainments,
distinguished in a manner whieh, though fitting, is to a
modest mind just the least bit embarrassing. Mr.
Francis Punch is one of these superior mortals. If not
a worshipper of local genius, he is at least a respecter
of Sydney talent. Hie motto was evidently, when
making the arrangements for the rowing of his trophy,
“ The Press to the fore !” for when the time came and
the steamers started, the Press found itself very much
to the fora indeed Personally, during onr trip on
Saturday to see the final beats rowed, we were “right
in the eyes of her,” partly balanced on the bow by the
fore-stay, and partly, when danger threatened, main-
taining an equilibrium by clinging to the umpire. Yes,
when Francis Punch undertakes a thing he carries it
right through with a lavish hand. Nothing he took ia
hand would result, we are convinced, in a fiasco. He
would even, by his pretty generalship, shed lustre on a
cat-fight—attractive make a funeral. Everything was
on a scale of quite superior splendour. The tickets
themselves were especially gorgeous—being bordered
with gold and oscaloped at the edges like the letters
which, years ago, she used to write us. beginning—
“Dere trend i rite hoppin you are quite well which
leaves me at presing tbang gord." These tickets
admitting two, we went first on board the Commodore,
and travelling for’axd, found the Press compartment,
which was a small space railed off by stout planking.
Behind this barricade —a preventive, of course, against
popular fury—we found the Press represented by a
gentleman who sells newspapers, and a rising young
lawyer in spectacles. At this our heart fell. _ What I
this disappointment, after all we had set our minds on.
Were we not, then, to got a respectful look at Tarplee—
to revel in a wink at Withers ? In a few moments we
were ashore again, and b little later tripping aboard
the Prince of Wales. Forward here, too, the same pre-
caution had been taken against an attack by a foaming
popnlace upon their moral and political instructor*,
and Boated in the Press pen was quite a brilliant assem-
blage. One pleasing feature in the picture was that
not only were the belles-lettres represented to some
extent, but politics, eloquence, le sport , and even
religion had each at least one delegate.
• • •
Prominent amongst the occupants in the
enclosure was the gifted Grisbrook, who had come pre-
pared for the fray with enough copy-slips to write the
“ Decline and Fall " upon—modern editors' notes and
addenda included. Mr. Q. was assisted by another
young man of mild appearance, who was much respected
on account of a rumour being current that ho had just
completed his hospital experience, after going several
times “round the clock.’’ Then there was Richmond
Thatcher, Esq , the celebrated collector of curios,
precious stones, the shoos of racehorses, and the
author ef “The Travelled Actor”—a work which ws
confidently believe is destined to instruct and amuse
the exceedingly aged ef the very remote future. The
Frfeman’s Journal was not unrepresented. There
was present, oh behalf of that journal, a demure \ out h,
whose voice was like uuto the chimes of fct. Mary’s,
and whose face in repose reminded one of the popular
portrait of St. Peter with a billy-cock instead of a
halo, and the keys exchanged for a ream or so of cony-
slips and a pencil of corpulent appearance. Wewol.
corned him heartily, and offered to write a breezy
introduction, just to give him a send-off, but he smiled
gently, and said he was afraid bis editor would con-
sider our style too flippant. “It was not easy,” he
remarked, “to write a light article on a boat-race,
bringing into it allusions to Father Burse, the Vision
at Lourdes, and all about the Nun of Kenraare.” Dan
O’Conuor was there of course, and Mr. Gnrvan (who
is M L.A, for somewhere), and Colonel Kahlc, the
American Consul. Then there was as< out gentleman
with a blue ribbon in his button-hole, who was Mr.
Gratton, one of the hon. secretaries; and a slim gen-
tleman with a red-silk flag—just as though he were in a
balloon—who was the umpire. The most popular man
of the party, however, was a stout Adonis in a
light suit, who, having had considerable experience of
the Press, was no sooner seated tnan he commenced
to circulate a bottle of whisky, and a great box full of
cakes. We aiked him his name, in order that we might
hand it down to po-terity. Ho told ns, and we have
much pleasure in presenting it —Mr. Gardyne. There
was also present a silent gentleman, who Mr. Thatcher
informed ns was Alfred’s boas poet, disguised in a clean
shirt, and a sporting Maecenas completed the party.
The latter gentleman is, we believe, a general favourite,
and his identity will be guessed when we state that on
our putting to him the question, “ Do you think Trickett
will pull it off P” he replied “ The train, I believe, goes
at 9.45.”
• • •
It was a pleasant party, but we seemed to be
dull dogs. By way of enlivening matters, we tried
Mr. Kahlo with a Scriptural riddle, but he replied that
it was no use his guessing at it as he hadn’t “read the
Book.” Then some fleshly man proposed we should
have a little game; and we, therefore, commenced that
furious form of gambling known as “half-crown sweeps.”
But, though we were not brilliant, we were happy. A
pleasant trip that in a pleasant boat, which glided up
the beautiful river, all alive with steamers, and flecked
everywhere with sailing craft. Droll evolutions some
of these latter performed—especially those torture boats
yon hire with a flannel-pettiooat-sized sail and no centre-
board, which, when “on a wind,” go not’-enst on one
tack and son'-west on the other, notwithstanding all
the efforts of the amateur galley-slave, who toils un-
ceasingly with a five-foet paddle. There was a fine
breeze blowing, and ‘‘our harbour” was at its best —on
every side new beauties revealing themselves as the
panorama uplifted itself ; on the water every colour
flashing, on the rocks every shade reposing. One
boat was crammed—and with a distinguished com*
pany. Hanging on to the rail on the upper deck was
a legal light, who, it is rumoured, was some little
while since offered the Chief Justiceship of Cariboo;
Mr. Hilly, the mystic sportsman, was on band with the
inevitable jockey ; Laurence Foley, Esq , J P , with a
sparkle in his eye and a flower in his button-hole, was
explaining to George Hill, the exact interpretation of
the term, “03 rthetlo transfiguration ;” Billy Lees, who
has gained, as a snake-trainer, the immortality that
Tennyson has gained as a poet. “Stepping Charlie”
gleamed in the snnshine near the funnel, and “ Whis-
pering Jimmy” likewise enhanced the beauty of the
picture. ‘ ’ Miok the Cabman” scintillated on the port
side, and Kelly (whose cherubic smile was the admira-
tion of all) gazed with an anxious eye in the direction
of Hyde; and the blue-blooded portion of the picture
was completed by the appearance of the two newly im-
ported “books” Wallace and Wessy, in an “attitude” on
the steps. Besides these there were a few parliamentary
grovellers, a sprinkling of barristers, and the usual
military contingent—but we only care to chronicle the
presence of the more distinguished.
* • *
As our steamer contained the umpire—we are
too modest to mention in this instance ourselves—it was
the first to steam ©var the course, all the other craft
(except the Commodore which came later)—having to
take a back seat; much it seemel to the indignation of
a swarm of two-bobbers on board an old cough-
box, who whooped wildly at ns as we passed. On
reaohing One Man Wharf, Frank Punch got into a
wherry, carrying with him a wooden box, which
was ramonred to contain the “ sug.” When he had
pilled off amidst the general admiration of the pas-
sengers, a pleasant party in a straw hat with a blue and
white band came alongside. This was the starter, Mr.
Myers. “ Will yen have some whisky ? ” enquired the
hon. secretary. The starter considered. Me had a
serious, even an arduous duty to perform ; he knew that
the eyes of a world of his fellow-men were upon him—
but the bead on the potheen caught his eye, and he,
saying he would not consent, consented. Having then
been handed a cigar rather larger than a torch, he gave
the order to his gondolier and departed. We then lay
to, and a philanthropist having regaled the company
with more cigars of the same Brobdignagian brand, we
set to smoking and praising the invariable honesty of
pedestrians, until the men came out.
• • •
Rush was the first to show up. He was attired
in the orthodox rowing costume of decollete trousers,
singlet, and he had a green sash. Miok was greeted
with loud applause by those who had backed him; but
we, having put our little pot on the gallant oarsman
who was subsequently a splendid last, we gazed upon
the Grafton man with a malevolent eye. Seeing a smile
beam upon the F ref.man gentleman as Rash rowed
past, we said “ Caed mille failthe,” to propitiate
him. But he replied not, being busy in doing a
"general dovetailedness” (if we may he allewed to
borrow an expression of Mr. Curdles) with
the Nun, the Knock Apparition, and the Lady
of Lourdes. Laycock was the next to show. Ha
had a red scarf, and everybody held their breath
while he stopped paddling and drank something ont of
a bottle. Elias most certainly looked splendid— quite,
so far as appearances went, taking the shine out of Rush.
Beach, with a black sash, came next, bnt his style was
not much admired —the new man being generally written
down an “eel-puncher.” Trickett. who sported
lavender, was the last to embark, and he was loudly
cheered—especially by uv, who gave him as large an
amount of encouragement as could be compassed within
a wild halloo as he passed. Trickett, albeit a trifle pate,
looked in beautiful form, and rowed np to the starting-
boat like a machine. No sooner wore they off, how-
ever than the bottom seemed to come out- of him. Lay-
cock waited on him for a little bit. and then, getting
tired, shot past, after which Ned plodded on with
about as much chance of winning as an oyster has of
singing in opera. The race was just a pretty little
procession—something that reminded us of the way
they used to do the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race in
Formosa at the Royal Morgue.
* * «
Of course, the result —Rush 1, Beach 2, Lay-
cock 3, Trickett 4—should be popular. Ic is such a
charming instance of the eternal fitnefs of things.
Laycock has licked Rush ; Tiickett has beaten Laycock,
played with Rush, and pulled clean away from Beach.
Things are just a hit complicated now; but, if Laycock
(who has hacked himself to do so) would give Rush a
*• doing,” why complete chaos mnst ensue. It's beau-
tiful sport, sculling, anyhow. We like it awfully.
Pedestrianism, likewise. We mean, directly we get
rich enough, to go about all the year round doing
nothing but backing onr fancies in sculling races and
walking contests. We want to open a fruit shop—or
start a bank.
• • «
There was a lot of “ jaw,” coming home, about
poor Ned’s condition when he pulled up, the general
opinion being that he had been training since he beat
Beach on Thursday entirely on wax-matches and tar-
water. People were, generally, glad to see Rush win;
and, from the constant enquiries a big man made about
Laycock, it was at first thought that he was popular,
too. It subsequently transpired, however, that this
person bad brought on board with him a four-pound
butter-weight and a couple of bricks.
• * •
We shall go to the next sculling match, unless
there happens to be a chicken-fight on the same day.

THIS Company is formed to purchase and work the
rich Gold Mining Leases belonging to Mr. George
Slater, at Ophir, containing about 44 acres of Gold-
bearing Reef Lands, at the well-known “ Bluff,” near the
junction of the Lewis Ponds and Summerhill Creeks, and
adjoining the celebrated “ Belmore ” Mining Property.
Ophir is situated about 15 miles from Orange, and is
the locality where gold was first discovered in Australia,
and, in the immediate vicinity of the “Bluff,” the first
alluvial gold mining was successfully carried out in 1851.
The gold in its character was generally nuggetty, -and
piece* were found weighing up to 120 ounces each ; many
of the smallest of these pieces were attached to quartz,
and were sold under the name of “ specimens.”
The “Bluff” itself has evidently been formed by the
Summerhill Creek impinging against the hill side, and
cutting away a large portion of rock and earth—thus
forming an almost perpendicular cliff, and exposing an
enormous quartz reef. The “ Bluff ” Reef is, in the
opinion of all miners, the main reef of the Ophir Gold
Field, and there can be no doubt that the alluvial gold in
immediate contiguity came from this reef, the mechanical
action of the water having played the part of a quartz
mill, disintegrating the reef stone, thus setting free
the gold, which, after untold centuries, the diggers
collected in their cradles and tin dishes. But if any
further proof were wanting, it is furnished by the
fact that, about 15 years ago, Driscoll and Party made
a great discovery of “ specimens ” immediately under a
huge ma«s of slate rock, which had evidently fallen
from the “Bluff.” These “specimens” of quartz and
gold had been imprisoned in a crevice, at the slaty bottom
of the stream, by this heavy covering, and contained—
after being crushed by hammers—an immense quantity of
gold. It is towards this reef that all the leaders which
have been amd still continue, so rich in the immediate
vicinity are .apparently, directing their course. Of these
may be mentioned the one on the top of the “ Bluff,” in
Mr. Slater’s ground, from which 200 ounces of gold were
obtained in a few hours, and those in the celebrated “Bel-
more ” claim, which are now so rich, and from which a
largo parcel of stone, recently treated at the Mint, yielded
at the rate of 4,300 ounces of gold to the ton. The report
to the Minister for Mines from the Warden of the Orange
Gold Field, John T. Lane, Esq., dated July 17th, 1882,
mentions this discovery. His report is given with the
prospectuses in citculation.
In the principal Gold Fields ©f Australia, notably at
Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Chines, early attention was paid
to quartz deposits. Mines have been working for many
years, and hundreds of thousands of tons of quartz raised
to the surface from depths of frem 1,000 to 1,600 feet. This
shows the permanency ef quartz mining, and proves that
wnen quartz can be obtained in quantity, a few dwts. of
gold to the ton of quartz will pay handsome dividends, as
for instance, the “ Criterion ” ground, at Clunes, yielded
for 30,120 tons of stone, 6,457 ounces 4 dwts. of gold, or
at the rate of 4 dwts. llj grains to the ton, and paid
regular dividends; while, during the last twenty-five
years, the “ Black Hill ” lode, at Ballarat, has been made
to pay well for an average of about 3 dwts. Numerous
cases of large dividends being paid from poor r efs could
be quoted.
At no place in Australia does quartz appear in larger
quantities than at Ophir, and gold can be obtained from
the stone along the entire face of the exposed reef, which
is over 40 feet in width. This quartz could be followed
from the surface at the bottom of the “ Bluff ” into the
hill, thus affording at once hundreds of thousands of tons
of quartz for back stoping, and permitting its being
obtained at a minimum price, therefore it is contemplated
to work these huge reefs by means of modern appliances
and labour-saving machinery. Rock Drills, driven either
with steam or compressed air, when used to bench off the
quartz, will lessen the ordinary cost of mining fully one-
half, and the admirable position for crushing machinery,
immediately contiguous to an inexhaustible and pure
water supply, guarantees the most efficient means of
saving the gold and auriferous pyrites, as well as the
cheapest means of crushing.
By reference to plans supplied, it will.be seen that the
leases and machine site adjoin one another, except where
Damper Street appears. The sole right to mine under the
street has been secured by Mr, Slater, so that the area
available for the Company is actually more than 44 acres.
The machine site is embraced in the offer of the property to
the Company, but the area is not included above. Mr.
Surveyor Blacket’s report follows with others. The actual
distances of the workings on the enormously rich veins in
the Belmore Company’s ground from Mr. Slater’s boundary
are there set out.
A thorough examination of the property has been made
by Mr. Norman Taylor, the well known and talented
Victorian geologist, whose report also cs the
prospectus.
Machinery to crush 500 tons weekly, with patent percus-
sion tables for saving pyrites, stonebreakers, and the
most improved and complete stamping gear, can be
erected and set to work for £7,000.
It has been calculated that the cost of working will be as
follows for one week, viz.:—
To wages of 30 men employed in the mine
raising quartz, &0., at 50s £75 0 0
Do. 3 engineers driving mill 13 o 0
Do. 4 men employed at mill at 40s 8 0 0
30 cords firewood at 20s 30 o 0
Wear and tear of plant and general expenses 20 0 0
Management 10 o 0
Returns. £156 o 0
500 tons of quartz will, at 6 dwts. gold per ton,
yield 150 ozs. This, at the average value
of Ophir gold, say £3 19s. 6d. per oz.,
amounts to 596 5 o
Leaving a profit of ... £440 5 0
or. at the rate of £22,893 per annum ; and this profit is
irrespective of large sums obtainable from rich patches,
which are certain to be met with occasionally, if not fre-
quently.
It will be seen that this handsome profit is estimated
to be made on the low return of 6 dwts. per ton of quartz,
and that low average is purposely given because Mr.
Norman Taylor saw' prospects crushed and panned off,
indicating an average of 6 to 7 dwts. per ton, but there is
reason to believe that a much higher return mav be con-
fidently expected, and this fact must not be overlooked a
larger number of stampers than are required to crush 500
tons of quartz per week, when employed, would give even
more than the same proportion of profit on the outlay, as
some expenses would not be at all increased. Mr. Taylor
went so far as to report that the whole hill would probably
pay for crashing.
The terms under which Mr. Slater offers this magnifi-
cent property to the Company are—£2,soo cash and 7,500
shares fully paid up, out of the total number of 25,(XX)
shares, and the only other charges upon the Company’s
funds will be for usual brokerage, printing, &c.
Early application should he made for shares, as a large
number has been applied for privately.
The quartz being simply ready for quarrying at a
moment’s notice, and no dead work to be done, the right
is reserved to declare the Company formed when 12,000
contributing shares are allotted, as ‘it is veiy desirable to
give the order for crushing machinery without any delay.
In the event of the Company not being formed, deposits
will be repaid in full, to applicants.

at 12 o’clock sharp.
This Princely Estate, adjoining the most progres-
sive inlaul city in the colony,
SUBDIVIDED into 237 FARMS,
to be sold on the most IP era! terms.
The following collective notes are worthy the attention
of those to whom this magnificent property is unknown,
and may be acceptedgas strictly within the bounds of
fact: —
Ist—9ooo acres of this land are ready for 1 ha plough
—no clearing whatever required—and are suit-
able for the production of every kind of cereal
2nd—The land is equal to the celebrated Plains of
Bathmst, where farmers pay 20s. to 255. an acre
rent, and they prosper.
3rd—The demand for grain by the mills and breweries
in the ciry is so great that every year they have
to import from California, pay and repay car-
riage, and return the flour to Sydroy and else-
where. Suggestive of what the profits of giain-
growing must be.
4th—The farms are within two mips of the city,
consequently the products and everything grown
and reared can readily be turned into money
No loss in haulage and valuable tima—which
means cost and profit
sth—As sho wing the importance and progreesiveness
of the city, the lands in the suburbs for building
purposes have increased in value during the last
10 years from £5 an acre to £l5O, and in the
north-west of the city from £8 to £500; while
the population in the citv and district has run
up to considerably over 17,000.
6th—The traffic r> • oipts by railway for 1881, to and
from GouP' u, exceed those of Bainurst by
£12,360 15s Bi.
7th- ino s‘ os sold in Gonlburn yards alone for
1831 i - aunt to 162,152 head, and new private
bui dings erected (luring the year ate in num-
ber 137.
Bth—The stock forwarded fr'nn Goulburn to Sydney
for 1881 amounts 1o 58,451 head.
9th—The city has 5 banks cf issue, 2 cathedrals,
J churches of every denomination, grammar,
bearding, and public schools, collegiate institu-
tions, building societies, breweries, mills, tan-
neries, wooliconring establishments, factories,
splendid hotels, 3 newspapers. Mechanics’ In-
stitute and Public Library, Protestant, Temper-
ance, and Oddfellows’ Halls, reert a' ion grounds,
Agricultural and Pastoral Society, railway
workshops, , and next month the COllMi
RAILWAY will be oommeuosd, opening up all
the traffic of Mona r o
10th—Trams are in contemplation from Goulburn
to Crookwell and Taralga, opening up all the
trade to and from there fertile districts.
11th—-The climate is invigorating, fruits of all
kinds are in abundance, and commercial
travellers, who ought to know, pronounce
Goulbura as the most solvent and flourishing
city in the colony.
12th—Goulburn and its surroundings are most at-
tractive, splendid scenery, excellent shooting,
princely estates, good society, and, in fact,
everything that is required for the man of
pleasure and busiests.
13th—I he Government, in recognition of the vast
and growing importance of GOULBURN, the
capital of the South, have built haudso-- e po-t
and telegraph offices; the largest prison in the
colony is now being erected at a cost of over
£100,00); innatic asylum grounds have also
be, n purchased; bridges are in course of
erection ; and double railway stations are to

( model farm, homes for the peopl >, and the gentleman

extraordinary progressiveness, which may be obtained

Tyrannical Conduct of a Landlord. —A short
time since a capitalist;, purchasing a property,
said that he would insist on its being a quiet
place. ” But," remnrked a f riend, “suppose your
tenants have children “ Oh.’f replied the ”nr-
chaser. “ I won’t allow them to have any.” This
would be a most mnwarrantabls exercise of tbe rights
of the Lord of the Manor: vet even in some freeholds
the fine ladies object to children, leeause they give so
much trouble Bat at the centre of Granville the for-
tunate purchasers of allotments may have as many
children as they chco-e, and tbe neighbourhood is so
healthy that rosy cheeks will be seen snrrouudirg
every poor man’s table in unlimited numbers. There-
fore,* take no*o that the sale will take place on Saturday
afternoon. A special train will l“avo Sydney at a quar-
ter-past 2. The terms are wonderfully ea»y, and 'ree
passes mav bo obtained at the rooms of the Auc-
tioneers, Mills, Pile, and Gilchrist.—Anv.

Consultation on tbe Hawkeabnrv and Metrop. Double
having proved a success, considering in what a short
space of time it had been organised, another in a similar
manner on the Derby and Cup I have opened. Derby
entries number 132, and the Cup 128, so each subscriber
will have for everv 5s invested a Double, a horse in
Derby and one in the Cap. I am happy to Inform mv
clients that this is filling fast. The advantage of this
kind of consultation is that there are No Blanks, and
clients have an interest in both events, Derby and Cup,
Besides, look at tbe good hedging money if yon get a
•• leg-in.” There are 16,896 different possible doubles.
Not less than four tickets supplied. This will leave
the amount of £1224 in the sweep, which, less 10 per

WOMAN ITEMS.
Man was made to morfrn; women to run up
millinery bills.
Why do women present an attitude of cold
fashionaMeneas to a world which they might win by
their sweetness and inspire by their virtue ?
A woman has two smiles that an angel might
eTlV y_the smile that accepts the lover bet ore words
are uttered, and the smile that lights on the first-born
baby. A man has but one smile. Ton can see it as he
leans over the private bar at the “ Metrop.”
A recently-deceased prelate was very fond of
children, and few would forget bis fatherlv benignity
as he patted little girls on the head. This was his
favourite hymn:—
•* Gently treat the Utils ones,
For the darling lasses
Soon will grown to womanhood—
Time so swiftly passes.
Gently treat the little ones.
Kiss the blooming baby;
In the years to coma she will
Be your sweetheart maybe.”
Deliciously cool, this, from a St. Louis paper :
<<Mr. Willy C. Feates, an able and justly-oelebrated
member of mv company, has suddenly left it, taking
with him, as I am reluctantly compelled to remark,
two pairs of coloured tights, and one brand-new top
boot. Simultaneously with his evanish noent I note the
disappearance of my wife. I exhort Mr. Feates to send
back the articles extracted from my theatrical ward-
robe by an earlv train. Should my wife happen to be
with him when this advertisement metts hia eye, I also
exhort her to be mindful cf her duties as a wife and
mother, and to return to me. Should she, however,
not do so within a week from the present date, I shall
be unable to take her back, as by that, time I shall have
made other arrangements. M E. Eeade, Director of
the ‘Eeade Drama and Pantomime Company,* Bt.
Louis."
• • •
Men study women as they study tha barometer ;
but thev only understand the day after A woman
emits sometimes a daring opinion ; but. she is startled
it she is taken at her word.. Coquetry is not always
a bait: it is sometimes a shield.

The Rugby game in New Zealand is decided by
points—two for a try, five for a goal kicked from a try,
and four for a drop-kick goal.
For the N.S.W. Rowing Association Regatta,
Mr. P. J. Clark will act as umpire, Mr. A. P. Bros
judge, and Mr. L. J. G. Bennett starter.
Segenhoe is doing so well in Melbourne that his
party believe that in the Derby he will reverse the
verdict returned at the Eandwiok meeting.
The Krug Champagne Company have offered an
elegant silver trophy to the South Australian Bowing
Association for an annual champion competition.
This is the season when the Dnbbo man, desirous
of having a high old time on the Melbourne Cup day,
takes a store bullock along, and sells it at Hombush for
enough to pay all expenses.
It is reported that Mr. Fittes, the Victorian
amateur sculler, will be prevented through business
arrangements from taking part in the next contest for
the Champagne Trophy.
D. M‘Donald wants to row either Robert
Edwards or G. Perkins for £lOO or £2OO aside, the race
to take place four weeks from Saturday, over the
champion course, Parramatta Biver.
A match has been made between Clifford and
Beach in light skiffs, for £2OO aside, to be rowed over
the Parramatta Elver, within three months. Beach
allowing Clifford £25 towards expenses.
The skiff race in connection with the Glebe
Bowing Club, for the prize presented by Mr. P. Punch,
has been postponed till the Club’s annual regatta,
which is fixed for Saturday, 2nd December.
The Northumberland Amateur Turf Club have

the Club.
The Croydon and Victoria clubs commenced a
match for the Furness Junior Cup on Saturday, and
when time was called, nine of the Victoria wickets had
fallen for 52 runs—Crisp, with 26, being the only
double-figure scorer.
The Carlton Club paid a visit to Campbelltown
on Saturday, and defeated the local team by 26 runs.
The Carlton score was 135—T. Nunn 68, W. S. Wearne
36. Campbelltown, 169—Copeland 18, Mansfield 17, J.
Eudd 17, Fowler (not out) 14.
In the hour race at the Eight Hour sports,
Bichards covered 9 miles 1150 yards, finishing very
strong. This is, wo believe, the farthest distance yet
covered in the hour in Sydney. Parkinson offers to
make a match with him, giving two hundred yards.
At the N.S.W. Rowing Association Regatta,
which is to take place on the 14th instant, the probable
competitors for the Sydney Mail Cup will be Messrs.
Brett, Arthur, Gaden, and Thomson. The Eoyston
College crew are likely to have a walk-over for the
Mayor’s Cap.
In the match, Caxton v. Herald, for the
Printers’ Challenge Cup, the Herald’s second innings
closed for 153 runs—Green 70, F. Magoveney 32, A.
Magovoney 26, King 13. The Caxtons have given up
the contest. The next match will be between John
Woods and Co. and the Daily Telegraph.
The Sydney Lawn Tennis Association held its
annual meeting on the 6th instant. The following
officers were elected :—Secretary, W. Wyld ; treasurer,
J. Booth; committee, Messrs. Fletcher, Dixon,
Thompson, E. George, Hewlett, Cropper, and C. Smith.
A lawn-tennis tournament is to be held daring the
present season.
A cricket match was played on the 2nd instant
on the Surry United Ground, between team from the
Electric Telegraph and Daily Telegraph offices, re-
sulting in an easy victory for the lightning dodgers,
who scored 109 runs for the loss of 8 wickets, whilst
their opponents made only 18 runs. The scorers for the
winning team were Eichardson (not ont) 44, Bowen 18,
Yamton 15.
At the annual meeting of the Sydney Homing
Pigeon Society the following office-bearers were elected:
—Mr. T Thompson, president; Messrs. S. Hordern and

treasurer; Messrs. J Wright and C. N. Payton, hon.
secretaries; Messrs. Pratt, Freeman, Mnsgrave, Smith,
and blowgrove, committee; Messrs. M’Millan and
Hough, auditors.
The last race for the season under the auspices
of the Sydney Homing Pigeon Society, came off on
Saturday week from Monnt Victoria. The race was
for a silver onp, and was open to all comers. Fifteen
started, and the contest resulted as follows : —Mr. Q.
Smith’s Little Nell, 53 min., 1; Mr. G. Smith’s Forget-
me-not, 63 min., 2; Mr. C. N. Payten's Pilot, 109 min.,
3. The distance by rail is 77 miles.
The annual general meeting of the Sydney
Amatear Sailing Club was held on the 7th instant. The
following officers were elected : —Commodore, G. C.
Elliott; Vice-Commodore, J. Soutar; hon. secretary,
A. Green ; hon. treasurer, T. Stokes; auditors, H.
Soaxr and H. Doran; committee, E. M. Daltrich,
P. O. Williams, W. Grant, W. Johnson, and Dr.
Beiisario. The opening day is fixsd for October 21.
The Calcutta papers are full of admiration for
the magnificent lot of horses landed there from Aus-
tralia in the R illo. by Mr. John .Vilson, of circus fame.
The reports tnat Little Jack and others of the ship-
ment died on the passage are incorrect. The horses
were inspected by fifty cf the principal sportsmen and
dealers, who declared them to be the finest shipment
ever introduced, thus endorsing the opinion of judges
in Australia when they left.
In the match for the Furness Junior Cup, the
Clio Clnb defeated the Orientals by 32 runs. The latter
club is, through the smallness of the defeat, entitled to
another show. Still it should be borne in mind that the
Clio team obtained in the first innings 55 runs, which
was 3 more than the Orientals scored in both innings.
This is a crushing defeat, and the Orientals may thank
the flaw in the conditions, which gives them a further
chance. It is fair to them to notice that in the second
innings the Clio eleven were disposed of for 29 runs.
Fred. Archer, the celebrated jockey, had sis
mounts at a recent home meeting and scored four wins.
In the other events he ran into second place. The
“Tinman” now heads the list of winning jockeys ; his
total up to date being 116 victories. His income is
greater than that of many of his employers, and daring
the Epsom carnival the state of his health is a matter
of more public anxiety than that of the Prince of
Wales. His principal rival is Tom Cannon, who has
just succeeded in pulling off the treble—Derby, Oaks,
and Leger.
Thus a London writer: — “I saw a novelty in
the way of boats on the Thames the other day. By
means of an ingenious joint in the oats, the rowers sat
with their faces to the head, and while pulling in the
ordinary fashion the boat moved forward. Doubtless
there is some loss of power in this arrangement, but
the rowers have the great advantage of being able to
see where they are going.” This must be the system
practised by Hanlan, who, according to out veracious
D.T., while leading Triokett in his last race, “fre-
quently tamed round in his boat to see where the Aus-
tralian was.”
After the race, on Saturday night, Lay cock,
who has evidently held Rush and Beach too cheaply,
offered to row either of them for £203 a-
side. Beach was not prepared at present to make a
match—which means that he will, by-and.bye; and
Rush expressed himself so satisfied with the result of
the contest for the Punch Trophy that he does not
desire to row another race. Still Elias is importunate,
and, as Michael is plucky, they may yet come to
terms. ;But we hope they won’t. Rush isn’t however
likely to retire finally from aquatics until the bunyip is
discovered in the Clarence.
A match, for the Hoidaworth Challenge Cup,
was commenced on Saturday on the Association
Ground, between the Albert and the University Clubs
Thomas, a Victorian, and Wright, were the
only ’Varsity men who distinguished themselves
in batting. Dave Gregory bowled 13 balls for 3 wickets
and 1 run. McNeil bowled well for the Alberts, and
obtained top score Moses commenced his season
with a well-played 49. The game stands as follows
U.C.C., 115—Thomas 60, Wright 23, A C.C , 5 wickets
for 151—McNeil 63, Moses 49, Bailey 19. The match
looks almost a certainty for the Albert Club.
The programme of the Double Bay regatta
comprises 14 events, of which 7 are sailing and 7 rowing
races. Among the latter is one for all-comers in
licensed watermen’s skiffs, and we understand that a
liberal prize will be given; it should draw a large field.
The Hon. J, Marks has given a prize for amateurs,
residents of Paddington and Woollahra, pair oars in
licensed watermen’s skiffs. A valuable prize is given
for half-decked boats, a class which is coming into
favour. The programme winds up with a tub race for
all who have never won an advertised race. The
regatta promisee to be a very successful affair.
Most of the English papers claim that, in the
match Australian Eleven v. English Players, the latter
showed superiority in every point of the game. The
cOmparion is invidious, particularly as it is aot drawn
in the matches against the Gentlemen and the All-Eng-
land Eleven which were won by the colonials. Land
and Water says: “ Our visitors are, unfortunately,
by no means good losers,” and this is because the Aus-
tralians endeavoured to make excuses for their defeat.
If we are to judge by the sullen way in which English
teams took their “doings" out here, wo have little to
learn from them how to lose a match. However, the
English papers, generally, speak well of the boys : some
go for them bald-headed, and admit their immense
superiority.
The Wollongong races were well attended, and
fine weather prevailed. Three started for the Hurdle
Race; won by First Try. Bell Bird won the Maiden
Plate by a neck. Mermaid being second. Eight started
for the Prince of Wales’ Stakes ; a good race ; Moon-
light won by a neck, Maud second. Thirteen started
for the Wollongong Handicap, which was landed by
Cockney in 2 min. 43 sec., Kelso second. Fourteen
started for the Hack Race; won by Queensberry. For
the Flying Handicap, eight started, Kelso coming in
first. Six started for the District Purse; won by
Sultana. Silver Arrow appropriated the Town Plate.
Four started for the Tom Thumb Handicap, Ingomar
coming in first. The Selling Stakes proved an easy
win for Dreadnought.
In the return match between the Auckland and
Sydney footballers on the 3rd instant, Auckland again
won by three goals and two tries to one goal. The
Sydney footballers have been but fairly successful in
New Zealand. The team was weak as representative
of the N.B. Wales Rugby play, but still the New
Zealanders have in some instances shown themselves
to be worthy to cope with a much more formidable lot.
If, as is mooted. New Zealand sends a team next season
to Sydney, and the players are at all up to the New
Zealand strength, our clubs will have to lower their
colours to them, and it will take the champion team all
its time to find a passage to the Maori goal posts. The
recent tour puts the N.S.W. play behind New Zealand,
as fat as the Rugby game is concerned.
The Y.A-T.C. meeting was opened at Caulfield
on Saturday. The weather was fine and the attend,
ance numerous. Kanaka was made a big favourite for
the Selling Race but he was nowhere. Mllparinka won
by a length from Junius. Thirteen started for the
Handicap Hardies, Sportsman beating Rhesus by a
length tor first place. Nineteen youngsters started for
the Great Foal Stakes; St. Lawrence, the favourite,
won by half a length. Quality being .second. Twelve
came to the scratch for the big race, the Caulfield
Guineas; Guesswork, the favourite, secured third
place. A great race for first and second came off be-
tween Fryingpan and Boolka, the former winning by a
length. Marquis won the Amateur Challenge Cup
rather easily; Erin, the favourite, being second. The
Toorak Handicap resulted in an easy victory for
Verdure; Hebrew being second, and Larpent third.
The prizes for the contests for the Frank Punch
Trophy were paid over on Monday evening, viz., Kush
£2OO, Beach £7O, Lay cock £3O. Messrs. J- and T.
bpencer forwarded a cheque for £25 to Trioket to re-
coup him for his expenses. Mr. Frank P unoh paid con-
solation money to the losers, viz., Tnckett £ls, Pearce
and M'Donald £lO each. Thus, after all, Triokett
has, so far as stakes £o„ go, done better than
Layoock. Michael Rush’s health was proposed,
and in response he made a manly speech, stat-
ing that it was not his intention to row again, that
nearly all the matches he had rowed were for the pur-
pose of satisfying himself that he was the best man,
and he had now satisfied himself. He predicted Beach
would be the champion in two years’ time. Triokett at-
tributed his defeat to not going into training for a
longer period previous to racing.
The Adelaide Commissioner of Police has re-
ported upon the totalisator for the benefit of the South
Australian Legislative Assembly, who are about to
“ sit on ’’ the machine. He enumerates its advantages,
which all the world knows, but this is how ha gives
evidence against it“ The disadvantages are: It in-
creases the number of bettors on the course, as many a
man puts some money into the totalisator who would
never think of making a bet with a bookmaker. It is
apt to promote over-racing; I mean that the probable
profits to the proprietors are apt to induce them to
have mere race-meetings than they otherwise would.
This is, of course, an evil that might be remedied by
limiting the number of times at which it might be
used.” After that,the cass should be dismissed. “Too
many race-meeting” is a " consummation devoutly to bo
wished" by all sportsmen.
» Just at the present date it is a matter of doubt
whether our champion athletes should not receive more
praise for their mental abilities than they do for their
muscular prowess. For example, from Auckland comes
the satisfactory intelligence that ©ur football team was
rec 'utly banqueted by the Mayor, and after the pastry
doings had closed, Mr. Redfern Walker, who has been
baptised again, and christened ‘‘Jumbo,” sang" The
Torpedo and the Whale “—imitating Pattie Laverne’s
back kick to perfection—and after a few more vocal
gymnastics he favoured as many of the guests as hap-
pened to be awake at the time, with the _ “ Tarantara”
from Sullivan’s “ Pirates.” We are not informed how
the gifted Mr. Jumbo managed to sing four-part
choruses with only one voice, but in all probability he
poked his hand down his throat and sang the first and
second tenor parts on one side, and the first and second
bass on the other.
Thus the World ; — “ Now that H. R. Ball, the
quarter-mile champion, has run 220 yards at Aston, Bir-
mingham, in the almost impossible time of 211-5 seconds,
it will, perhaps, be conceded that performances at dis-
tances of a quarter-mile and downwards on that path
are worthless as showing the relative ability cf runners.
The track is downhill for over three hundred yards.
Ball, on the same day, ran 300 yards in 311-5 seconds,
time which he cannot make on the level; and John-
stone, a second-rater, was credited with the same time
a few weeks since. As Ball beat Browning, who is a
better man than Johnstone, by seven yards, the value
of the latter’s record can easily be arrived at. The
reason so much importance attaches to what is done at
Aston is that it was there Myers ran his celebrated
quarter in 43 3-5 seconds. He is, doubtless, equal to
such a feat, perhaps to a better one even; but ne has
no right to that particular record, seeing what an
unfair course it was obtained upon.”
Perkins withdrew from the contest for the
Punch prizes at the last moment. He complains of
being treated with marked discourtesy by the com-
mittee. He addressed a polite letter to them, repre-
senting that he had travelled 16,000 miles to take part in
the contest, and submitted th .6 he was entitled to some
compensation, particularly as the prospectus stated
that the boats of the competitors would be brought out
free, and an arrangement ma is w.th the F. and O. and
Orient Lines for a reduction of the passage money. He
had te pay full freight for his boat, and his entire
passage-money as well. He received no reply to the
letter. Thus Mr. Perkins. The committe state that
they did reply; that the prospectus stated that endea-
vours would be made to obtain the above concessions,
and that these endeavours failed. The committee are
not to blame, but still this kind of thing is rough on
Perkins. He is a stranger in a strange land, and bis
case is worthy of consideration. It must be remem-
bered that Laycock received no expenses in the Hop
Bitters contest. But that was in England.
It would be worth the while of the selection
committee of the Cricket Association to take notes of
the play in some of the Junior Club matches. There
are bowlers, batsmen, and wicket-keepers, who do not
plav |with the senior clubs, their matches being mads
sufficiently interesting for them by private persons, but
who would surely find a place in the first elevens of the
seniors. There was a time when it was the ambi-
tion of every young player to get a show in the first
eleven of a senior club. Now, pots are plentiful
amongst the juniors, and they feel no inclination to
serve an unrewarded apprenticeship in the Association
Clubs. If the mountain won’t come to Mahomet, he
should go to the mountain. A match should be ar-
ranged between a leading club and a fifteen selected
from the juniors. The secretaries of the leading
clubs deplore the fact that they have many members
who join them simply for practice, and when an impor-
tant match is arranged they cannot play, having an
engagement with their own junior club. This is worth
looking to if fresh blood is wanted in our representa-
tive teams.
The Rockhampton Cricket Club held a meeting
to consider, among other important matters, about
selecting a team to meet that of the Hon. Ivo Bligh.
The Britishers being bo very well up in every depart-
ment of the game, it was thought at first it would be
necessary to bring out against them eighteen Rock-
hampton knights of the willow. The Hon. C.
8. I). Melbourne objected to this arrangement
in toto. His reasons were—that an eighteen
is invariably hard to manage in the field,
and its members are more often in each
other’s way than not. He was for a strong, compact
eleven, composed of the very best fellows they could
pick. Here are the pickings The Hon. C. S. D.
Melbourne, captain ; Professor Knot, W. Higson, Dan
Martin, Jos. Pattison, Frank Hopkins, Fat Egan,
W. C. Face, John O’Rourke, Josh Davis, and M.
Cranley. The strength of this excellent team centres
in its bowling. As a slow, left-handed bowler, it would
be difficult to find the equal of Josh Davis. His ball
creeps slowly up until within two yards of the wicket,
when it begins to hop from side to side, and finally
wriggles among the sticks in a most extraordinary
manner. Dan Martin and Pat Egan, in the same
capacity, stand second to none—not even to the great
Spofforth—at least from a Rockhampton point of
view. Anyhow, the committee may well be con-
gratulated on the men they have chosen to uphold the
prestige of the colony. En passant, Wm. Pat-
tison, the generous patron of all athletic sports, has
kindly promised to give a massive silver cup for the
highest batting score on the side of the local team.
The banka of the Parramatta River were
thronged on Saturday by thousands eager to see the
final heat for the Punch Trophy, and the steamers fol-
lowing the race were densely crowd id, the authorities
being compelled to start one of them away from the
wharf before the advertised time, eo that no more pas-
sengers should be taken. We understand that the
steamers plied in the interests of Mr. Punch, the donor
of the prize, and we have no doubt that the £3OO he so
liberally offered will thereby be recouped. We are
glad to hear that the losers received consolation prizes
from the proceeds. When Mr. Punch first offered the
prize, his liberality was applauded both here and in
England. It would tarnish the lustre of his famo as
an aquatic patron if the fact leaked out that the affair
cost dim nothing. The race is easily described. After
the flutter from the start. Rush assumed a decided
lead. Beach being second. Throughout the race. Beach
made gallant attempts to overhaul his leader, but
Rush was always ready for him, and eventually won by
two lengths from Beach, who was about the same dis-
tance ahead of Laycock, Triokett toiling in the rear
hopelessly beaten. Rush’s win was only half
popular (so far as the betting public were concerned),
but the cheers that went up showed that his honesty
and determination had found public sympathy. Beach,
the coming man, surprised everybody by his splendid
rowing. Although the lightest man of the four, he is
wonderfully built. Between his shoulders is one mass
of muscular cords, giving him the appearance of a
round-shouldered man. Otherwise, he has all the cut
of a sculler, and when the fact is borne in mind that he
has been but a few months acquainted with outrigger
rowing, a brilliant career may be predicted for him.
He is 29, and, therefore, by no means young; but two
of the doughty oarsmen who rowed with him com-
menced their rowing as late in life. The future aquatic
champion must, however, be an outrigger rower at 24
or thereabouts. Therein is one of the secrets of Hanlan’s
success, inasmuch as he has never yet rowed a younger
man than himself in any great race. Laycock’s rowing
is unaccountable. We are told that he had not been
trained sufficiently. That is an excuse for his defeat,
but daring the race he seemed to be doing nothing but
" guying ” Triokett. Some hard things have been said
of him; we hope they are unmerited. Triokett is a
hero of the days of yore; bis career is done, and now
we can fling back the taunt to our antipodean scoffers
that Hanlan defeated a sick man, as Triokett in his
turn wrested the championship from a played-out
sculler. It is now proved that he could not be the
Triokett of old when he met Hanlan, and the small
consolation remains to us now that though for a while
we shall have to eat humble pie, the day will come when
even Hanlan will have to succumb to an Australian
conqueror—to a man who conquers “by effluxion of
time.”

the attendacce was large. The hall w*.s a pretty sight,
the ©mature being of a special kind. One almost
Beamed to Bister the field Itself, so Well were the ideas
carried out. E'ield aigs marked the boundary lines,
writh ftt each end, and two balls were suspended
by the tlu b colours. A lavish display of flags and greenery
the walls, and an excellent floor was prepare".
*ow wall-fl iwers were observable, and the M.’s C.
d cferveJ credit for thei<" efforts and energy. Amongso
the guests a lady from M irrickville, in black, was voted
by some the belle, though others thought the pluron
Lttl« lady in white, from Five Dock, held,the palm. A
young lady from PadiliagtOa, in pink and rnby,
aUr- .jied notice, both tor her splendid figure and
daißmg. The daughter or a respected solicitor, clad
iniiohpkk satir)> was a shrine; and the sweet little
SiUa at B ilmam B ill recently, was again admired.
v>.hor pretty dresses were : white Indian muslin and
Scarlet s;sb, from Burwood ; a black grenadine and
cardinal sash ; a beautiful blue broohd. with white lace
Uud blua wreath, from Aihfleld; and an Indian mudin
w th no end of tucks and ga'h-crs. Two cousins from
the line, one in pink, white lace, wreath of pink and
v hite b.csioms—the other in craam and white, with
scarlet wreath—were much admired. A bride from
San-mcrLiH wire a lovely white satin train, the front
consisting of three deep flounces of real Irish point
lace. From Croydon came a lady in handsome lemon
satin, trimmed with lacc The lorm of a little lady
from iJarlirghurst, in black, wis beshadowed by her
mu d attendant. A married lady from Bedmyre pos-
sessed a tweet face peeping over a costume of black and
white; an l a Homebnsh lady was nice in blue and
white. Fir.-t-class refreshments were provided, and
Sauerbitr s music was very good.though there was some
regret that the man who made such earnest efforts to
b!*,w his brains out through the cornet didn't succeed.
If he can only manage it next time, it might save bis
Lfe. But the cornet man was innocuous compared
with t e gentleman from Concord, who danced in a
Biileha had evidently taught himself—a style never
in tenth d to bo enclosed by any four walls. He ought
to self ct in the interior, where he’d have more room.
Tweniy dances w-teon the programme, and a special
train took guests home to the city at half-p*st 1.

About fifty couples were at thej Criterion
Assembly Ball on the 4ch instant, at Needs’ booms
Mr. I) F. Kuasell acted as M.C. with politeness, and
B ildhoum's musicians produced the melody. Among
the fa»c/ dresses were little Esmerelda, Olaudine, a
goad Follo«-the-Drum, and Patience. Miss Brims
wore a cream and cardinal satiu ; Miss Holt was Grace
i»arling, and Wolverene was “a lass who loves a
sailor. ' A bine satin, black velvet and steel beading,
was nice; also an arrangement of green, shades of pink,
and fiao white lace. Two handsome drosses were those
of Miss Bose, bine and cerise trained satin; and of
Miss Cardwell, a delicate blue brocade, cream puffed
satin skirt, and fillet of silver and pearls—a beautiful
dancer. Miss Pascoe was in white plush and cash-
mere. And ,eno of these three was belle.

On Tuesday week a ball took place in the
School of Aru>, Murrurnndi, in honour of the half-
h'diday movement. Some very handsome toilets were
oosotv.d. The honours of belle were divided between
a petite data girl in navy blue velvet trimmed with
cream Is os, anu garlanded with rcs-a, and a tall, fair,
graceful maide-i attired in cream satin. A tail, hand-
hi .mo girl in pink was also much admired. Tne hostess
of the ttoyal in black silk was noticeable, as a good
dancer. Break up at 5 a ra,

It baa always been the custom of the Newtown
{Monday night) Skating Kink to close each Winter with
a ba)', and on Friday last about 150 rinkists and friends
danced the season cut in the Nithsdale Booms. The
ornamentations were rich t so were some of the ladies’
uressaa, while others managed, by mera simplicity, “to
snatch a grace beyond the reach of art." Most suc-
cessful in rhi* who a lady from North Shore, who wore
a sleeveless sateen of pale bine, almost devoid of any
e mbellishment; yet, by her wearing, rendered elegant.
A. sister was similarly simple in ivory cashmere body,
buu's v. i mg skirt, and large daisies, harmonising well.
Almott a t win to this, was the costume of a lady from
I i imaiu Terrace, of ivory cashmere, lace and satin
trinjm d. with roses la the hair; a very pleasing
j iol ure As the poet didn't say, “ Man wants but lit tie,
rut that little, long." A large coterie of guests came
f.otu btimuiore, and of these a slender brunette from
Enielia.'* wore raiment which riveted attention—
luight ruby satin and cashmere, trimmed with oansies
ana wisteria, a decidedly handsome drees. A dress
uuivt admired was a delicate satin of the faintest
shade of piuk—or, as a luminous Milesian would no
doubt call it, the colour of a “pale blush," It—the
dress, not the blush—was worn by an Ashfleld lady,
ai d its shirred and gathered front was of beautifully
fi.ie work. Another remarkable costume was a panier
of bro iza brown, or, more correctly, kortfy brown satin,
with yellow brown skirt formed in long narrow killings,
ttimmed with white lace and srnttowers. Glebi sentit.
Ivy les v.,8 wore twined around the cardinal and cream
of a lady from “ Warrestou;" and that same ivy leaves
(this Is unite grammatical, now, if yon only peruse it
calmly)—that same ivy, we repeat, leaves
many immersible hearts yearning to twine also.
Among the gayer dresses, a pretty one was a
cream shirred; skirt and cardinal satin panier, from
Newton; and a woolbroker’s wife wore a strikingly
hard, ome yellow-corded silk, the front and edging of
b. dice being a mass of white beads in flower pattern,
1 eking chastely rich, while the skirt and hair were
adoruid with gigantic poppies. Miss Annie Haddock
was generally conceded the position of belle of the ball.
Everyone expressed satisfaction at the music provided
V y Mr. D« Groen, who is groen’ very popular in terpsi-
emoreuu haunts ; while the waltz played by a gentleman
volunteer was a treat. The catering of the City Co,
under Mr. Tandy, was good enough to satiate all. Mr.
Uoilman was a good M.C.; and, indeed, the arrange-
ments all throogh were creditably carried out. At
half past three the end arrived, and the guests de-
parted, Many had long distances to drive home. And

patronage, and dancing was continued till four o clock.

On Monday. Mrs. Martin gave a social party at

aud u drama Ho em ertainment. The theatrical display
was unique, and consisted principally of a protracted
hunt bv tbe amaiinr actors for a goose, which each
fjold have fauud at auy moment by laying hands on
h e neignbeur. Tie curtain fell on a tableau where
they were all woeiully mixed, and no one could tell
w hich was the goose. A little dot, Miss Stanley, sang

deal spo.’led by the du c t after the chairs had been
moved off the floor, and clothing suffered accordingly.
Dark costumes prevailed; a pur of bine cashmeres
trimmed with blue satin .and pearls, also a pink cash-
mere, satin bodies and flowers Rooked well. And a
idung lady recently mated, in black satin and cardinal
Bdwefs, danced bast. Mrs. Martin, dresfied in a hand-

March, Mr. Halle well rendered several songs, Misses

A very jolly day was a cent last Satnrday at Mr.
D. Fletcher’s Glee, Bondi, by a party of artists and
lovers of art. The affair being a thoroughly Bohemian
ladies were excluded. The glorious breeze from the
Pacific sported with ho golden ringlets in the Glen
that day. The host’s faithful Cerberus, a tall, gaunt
Milesian, guarded the approaches to this masculine
paradise, and the lords of creation revelled in their
new found freedom. Broad and cheese, beet and beer,
ham asd tongue—such was the menu. No mysterions
dishes, cunningly concocted to tempt dull palates, but
an honest Bohemian meal, everyone standing about
promiscuously, knife in band, helping himself. Seme
of the most influsntial man in the community were
present. A hai dsome ruler of Bta e, the reins of
Government flung aside for a time, and a jolly ware-
houseman, stretched their leviathan forms on the grass
in company with a popular little auctioneer. A C.M Q.,
who is no mean artist, puffel away at his myall and
chatted with an Important official f’om the Land 'o
Cakes, who believes more in “Works” than in
“faith” There were, also, a venerable gentleman, who
is a companion of the Muses as, well as of the Saints ;
and a genial linguist, who could ask for his bread and
cheese in a dozen different larguageSi The artist s ,
sketch-book in hand, scattered themselves over the
Glen and the adjacent Lynn, exploring some of tho
thousand lovely nooks in search of “ bits.” Some very
pretty work must result from their labours. " That’s
a charming imitation of an old ruined tower,” said one
of the party to host Fletcher. “ Tes,” he replied with
a twinkle in his eye; “ but lam going to build an older
one next weak” About dusk the party broke up, with
cheers for tho host, and expressing delight at the
happy day they had spent.

The master painters had a largo gathering at

went to the Sir Joseph Banks, Botany. Excellent
masio and banquet were provided, and sports of many
descriptions were practised, according to taste. Mr
Dyer was quito a busy bee in the hive of pleasurers, and
some of the young painters “ laid it on” very thick in-
deed A bachelors’ bill was held at Unlla on the 2nd
instant, under tho management of the local astrologer.
Between 2 and 3 couples were present, and dancing was
>ept up with hut few intermissions from 9 30 to nearly
10 30 p.m. What made the affair so successful was tho
fact that no one knew anything ahont it. The pro-
gramme consist'd of three polkas; for after nrvncr us
efforts to divide six people into fonr couples, the
attempt to form a quadrille had to h< abandoned.

son on the 21st A Fire Brigade ball, at Parramatta,
has been announced for the 18th instant, in connection
with the annual demonstration Miss Wriy, of West
Melbourne, sues W. M Clarke, member of Parliament,
and proprietor of a newspaper, for £2000; libel A
Swiss Fair has been running in Melbourne during the
week, and wall supported Sir Samuel Wilson has
grasped glory, inde-d. He Ins danced with Royalty.
After expanding years of labour, and mines of wealth,
be at last got the Duchess of Teck into his house, to a
ball that cost the price of a sheep station, and as she
“ put him through “ the quadrille, he told her Royal
Highness all about “ them salmon.” By the courtesy
of the traffic-manager, a special saloon car will be
attached to the train leaving Sydney for Parramatta on
Friday evening at 8 p.m. Sydneyites who attend the
Parramatta Rowing Club Ball will have an opportunity

POLITICAL POINTS.
Mr. C. D. Hardsell and Mr. Emanuel, of Goul-
btirn, threaten to stand for Tumut.
The reVeutle of, S.'S.Wi is nearly .£lO a head of
population. That of England RWout 8*>,2d0.000
against £7,250.000.
Mr. William Forster says that the prtssttei
Homes o*. Parliament would answer all requirements
were the G rvernnieut side not so uncomfortably packed
during divisions.
The senior member for Forbes has been blessed
and cursed in the same week by Parkes and Forbes
respectively. The railway is the “ bridge agin their
own door" this time.
Memo, for colonial patriots : — “ The only differ'
ence between the criminal class and the so-called re-
sp=ctab'e classes is, that the former put their worse
thduglits into action, while the latter would willingly
do likewise, .but arc afraid to incur the penalty which
falls upon evil-doers."
*• Balmain, Bcnrke, Canterbury, Bedfern, and St
Leonard’s are now entitled to additional representatives
under the Electoral Act. and arrangements SM to be
made to extend the power at the next election—rmlch,
if the political prophets are right, is not far off.
The correct Ministerial programme: “ Stick to
our salaries as long as we can ; whan forced to it, bring
in a Land Bill, and if on being defeated on the second
reading, as we are sure bo be, ask Gussy for a dissolu-
tion In tha meantime * keep it dark ’ is the safe
course, so that eur opponents may not have time to
prepare." This is from an inspired source; s« free and
independent electors, be up and doing, if you wish to
save the country from any farther experience of a
Government which is remarkable for its reign of mis-
rule.
The Victorian financial quarter closed on Satur-
day night, and at half-past ten o’clock the officers of
the Treasury had the who’e of the figures totted up
and published. Our Treasury, too, under the Hon.
Geoffrey Ea?ar, works like a clock, and is always up to
time ; but our Education Beport for 1881 has just been
made pnb’ic, six months after the time fixed by the
Act, and a fortnight after it was fully commented on by
the Herald How Hunter-streat managed to sea the
papers before they were laid 1 efore the Assembly, is a
matter that requires explanation, because it apparently
involves a decided snub for the Government Grovel.
Sir Henry evidently trod on the British lion’s
tu.il* and hurt him One of the hottest leaders which
has appeared in the London Thunderer speaks of Colo-
nial Prenrera as “Prime Ministers of a country of
sheep rung and railway lots." It refers to colonists
visiting England as ‘'aprearing more or less oppressed
with the wholly-urfounded notion that everybody is
looking at them " It declares not one of the colonies
ever “ produced any prodigy of statesmanlike capa-
city,” and finally it raps us over the Inad for that base
ingratitude to the mother-country which allows ns to
“display our independence by putting protective or
restrictive taxes upon English commerce ** Here’s a
chance for the Rum to sail in; wipe the London
libeller off the face ,of the earth, and thus redeem
Australia's character.
Mr. Heydon who, though a professed supporter
of the Government, is on every vital question opposed
to their policy, had what hir John would call “the
audacity" to take uo nearly three h urs' time the other
night in di“cus=ing that at present forlorn hope—Pro-
teation for N.iW Almost every session a motion in
favour of protection is proposed, and invariably a vote
is taken without any debate, but on this occasion the
wily Sir Henry thought it desirable to try and blow
down what he in * ffect termed the airy castles erected
by the latest champion of Protection A great portion
of S ; r Henry’s speech was devoted to praising Mr.
Hevdcn for his zeal and industry. Perhaps the
Government think that by applying the soft soap
freely they will induce the hon. member for Yass to
vote for that|Land Bill.
Tom Bailway Bent (Vio.) has called George
(Sultan China) Finoham an unmitigated liar. Some
time ago George charged Tom with selling to the
Government some of his wife’s land supposed to con-
tain ballast, and Tom came out right. The facts be
thus. Georgs-some time ago, played into the hands
of O’Loghlen, and the Ballarat Liberals came down on
him. The Major, who, to say the least, is acquainted
with Bateman, of the Courier, who again, in conjunc-
tion with R. T. Yale, Palmer, and Henry Bril, M.P.
rules the Billarat Liberals to the extent of 18 seari>,
gave out that, unless George harked back, Ballarat
West would know him no mare—has of late months,
gone in to retrieve his position. He attacks the
O’Loghlenitos on all occasions. Therefore. Tom Bent,
who deserted the Liberals and bags his £2,000 a year
like a man, cannot permit George to contradict him
without letting out in the old ling » by which, when he
was cabbage gardening, he used to put down dealers
who wanted 13 cauliflowers to the dozen.
Two would be shining lights in the political
firmament have clashed, but the darkness has not been
intensified—in fact more light will be the result In
other words, the mighty Pigott and the elegant Smith —
the man of colossal inte’lect who represents the Macleay
—have “fallen out;” which means that if the cranium
of either ever held a good opinion of any other man
(he cranium has dropped it, and is now stuffed with
self-seasoning—d la Higott or dla Smith. When two
attorneys meet in a combat of words, one would expect
to hear something refreshing, but the severest terms
used by these two men were “ di a c mrteous ” and
“unlearned,” which shows how profoundly learned
they both are. If B B baid said something like this —
• The—ah—honorable and—ah—unlearned member has
shown his ignorance of the requirements of this great
and rising country, of the intebect of which —ah —I pre-
sent such an illustrious example by not including my
name in the list of the new Ministry, that is-on paper ;
in fact, he seems to think that all the offices under the
State, from the Governor down to the Lands Office
charwoman, ought to be monopolised by Pigott and
Triokett”—he would have squelched the other man
completely, because he would have been very close to
the mark.
A Brisbane photographer advertises that he has
made arrangements to take, “on his premises,” instan-
taneous outdoor pictures!
We are only mortal, and are perhaps the only per-
sons— barring their Honors the Judges—who have not
their likes and dislike*. Accordingly we love B«nw of
enr correspondents mors than others Now, “J, B
who writes us, is a correspondent after our own heart.
He says:— ‘ Sir, —Would you please to put these
Original Lines in your good paper The Bulletin. Try
and have it put in this week But only ‘J. B.' under
the poetry.” “J. B." sends ns accordingly some verse
which has sufficient merit of its kind to deserve a
modest notice at our hands. He commences with the
following passionate poetic hint, a true echo of a
wounded spirit
“ My Miry Ann, you are a pretty noble belles (sic.)
So loving, sweet and free [III]
I think about yon often,
Tho* yeur face I cannot see.”
The next stanza is pleasantly enigmatical. It. reminds
ns of some of the “ Ancient Mariner," when Coleridge
is at his best
“ I wonder what you flay (sic ) at—
Please tell me when yon write.
And when you have a Birthday,
I hope you’ll me invite."
But the next stanza suggests the deep research, the
delicacy of thought, and tho consummate knowledge of
human nature, mingled with most airy imagery, that are
evidently the exclusive g’fts of this delightful bard.
Bead this, now, to slow music :
“And have at the table,
That i may with you be,
And i should like some nice cake,
And please a cup of tea."
Now we are tolerably well read in the English classics,
but we know nothing more truly natural than this
Here we have the poetry of the hearth, the stanza of
the scullery, and (so to speak), tho rnyme of the rub-
bish-box. There is nothing ideal in this. There is, as
Mr. Weller observed, nothing about “Wenus in it.”
We read naught about rippling rills, and sparkling cas-
cades, fury ferneries and goblin grots No ! Here we
have a bard whe is truly and honestly realistic, and
who, now that we have quite finished with him, may re-
turn to ths kitchen and continue chopping the hash.
A DANCING BELLE.
Our head is heavy, and our eyelids fall,
And we would fain
Go back to sleep, and dream of last night’s hall.
Still! throbbing brain !
Wo waltzed with Ah ! like magic, now it all
Grows bright again.
Oh, mad delirium of the flying feet.
What joy you stir !
Again we see that smi'e, and hear that sweet
“ With pleasure, sit: ”
It is divine —a terpsichorean treat —
To waltz with her.
We waltzed—Ah, yes, that’s all we know,
And all we care;
To ns, she was not slender, high, or low.
Or dirk, or fair,—
But just a bird, who seemed on wings to go
Through realms of air.
Ask you her name who so divinely twirls ?
We will not tell 1
She, whom we love above all other girls.
For waltzing wall.
Is just—we’ll say no more—a pearl of pearls,
A dancing belle I
