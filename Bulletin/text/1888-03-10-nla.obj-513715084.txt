Free Newspaper Postage.
Mr. M'Eluonk’s motion in the New South Wales
Assembly last week to the effect that the free
carriage of newspapers through the post be
abolished revealed a serious falling off in the num-
bers of the loud and voluble gang of brigands
who have rallied up to whoop for so many vil-
lainous steals in the course of the past year. Out
of the 126 members who mate up -the New South
Wales Lower Home only 36 ventured upon any
expression of opinion, and of these 19 voted for
and 17 against the continuance of the perennial
robbery which is carried on under the name of
free newspaper postage. Sir Hbnry Parkbs, as
the unnatural father and dry-nurse of the system
by which the Freetrade Press of Sydney is sub-
sidised at immense cost to the country at large,
led the opposition, and poured forth the balm of
his husky eloquence upon the ponderous journals
which support his policy in columns of chloro-
form and lead ; and the Cabinet followed him and
voted as one brigand on behalf of the cause, but
the arguments put forth in defence of the Premier’s
cherished institution were in every case lament-
ably weak. In an assemblage of ordinary intelli-
gence, indeed, the pleas urged in defence
would in themselves have sufficed to damn
the cause past all redemption, but then in-
telligence is the article in which the present
New South Wales Assembly is most defi-
cient. Manners and honesty are both in short
supply, but, however conspicuous their absence
may be, the dismal folly of the House is the
feature which will make it most prominent in the
future days when it will be dead and stuffed and
relegated to an honoured position in History’s
Chamber of Horrors,
• * *
The New South Wales Post-Office is at present
run at a loss of £BO,OOO annually, and for this
condition of things the Barnacle of the gin-shop
who is responsible for the management of the De-
partment, has no remedy to suggest. r J ha cause
of this tremendous shortage is undeniably the
system of free newspaper postage. Even allow-
ing that the published statements of the Sydney
dailies as to their circulation are one-half
Ananias, the imposition of a charge of a half-
penny upon each journal carried by mail would
almost be sufficient to restore the financial equili-
brium and make the Post-Ofllce a self-supporting
institution. The wealthy newspaper proprietors
of Sydney—the Fairfaxes, the Bennetts, and
the crowd of escaped parsons who print their
washy platitudes in the daily press—are, in the
lowest sense of the word, pensioners on the
nation. They receive their annual dole out of the
■Treasury like the meanest pauper, and the fact
that they receive it indirectly does hot lessen the
degradation of their position. Every citizen,
from the wealthy merchant down to the hungry
jag-picker, is taxed, more or less, to sup-
port this race of clamorous mendicants, who
take the country’s alms with a patronisingly
cut-throat air, and are perpetually demanding
more, and threatening ruin and destruction
and political convulsions and social smash if
their demands are not supplied. And not only
is the nation taxed to the extes t of some
£BO,OOO per annunajshat this race of sturdy paupers
may have their gcods carried free by post, but a
further outlay of £lO 000 a year is incurred for
special trairs to convey their merohand'se
gratis to all parts of ihe colony; and so tenaciously
do they assert their right to raid the Treasury
of a lemi-insplvent land to tte extent of
about £lOO,OOO annually, that no Government,
seemingly, dare interfere with this stupendous
national steal. Th* Minister who ventured to
insist that the Fairfaxes and the Bennetts
should pay their way, instead of turning the tax-
payer into a beast of burden to carry the load of
the:r political sermons and dirty divorce reports
all over a weary land, w, aid inevitably be written
down, and, worse still, suppressed down ; acd
rather than run the lisk of facing the undying
malevolence of that glorious Palladium of t.ur
liberties-the daily Press—each member of the
Cabinet gives his obsequious vote in defence of
the greatest political fraud ever perpetrated out-
side the halls of Tammany.
* * *
Newspaper postage, according to Mr. Garrett,
the ex-“ red-hot burning brand of shame ” of the
New South Wales Assembly, is a “tax upon
knowledge,” and, as such, a thing to be abhorred
by the apostles of light, but the gentleman from
Milburn Creek does not attempt to carry his
opinions to their log’cal conclusion, or to suggest
that the Education estimates should bo debited
with the cost of spreadirg abroad those unclean
divorce reports of which the Evening News is
so fond, or the “outrage” items ia which the
soul of the J ernii, wallows with delight.
The application of Mr. Garrett’s noble senti-
ment is woefully narrow. The works of
Darwin and Huxley are taxed in course
of transmission to illuminate the bucolic in-
tellect ; Shakespeare and Milton do not
travel free ; Byron has to pay his way by the
ouncs, while the drivelling rhymes of Mary
Jane Smith, in the Mail, are transmitted
at the cost of the nation ; and while know-
ledge is thus subjected to a pos al tariff, all New
-outh Wales is plundered to pay for the distribu-
tion of shameless ignorance and imposture and to
spread patent medicine advertisements, announce-
ments of land swindles, garbled reports of Parlia-
mentary ear chewings, and lying “ boosts” by
which the miserable agriculturist is induced to
swamp his savings in wild cat mining enterprises.
The degraded uses to which some members of the
Ministry have applied tha system of free news-
paper postage should have sufficed for very sftame
to smother their high faintin’ bathos about the
spread of knowledge through the medium of the
clammy sheets of a venal press. It is only a f*w
years since one of Parkks’s present colleagues
engineered a new journalistic venture, wnose
contents consisted almost entirely of a gigantic
puff of the owner’s wares ; a few scraps of hoary
intelligence were added to prevent it degenerating
too openly into a price-list; sundry advertise-
ments from va* ions sources defrayed the cost of
publication ; and 100,000 copies of this journalistic
sham were scattered over the length and breadth
of every colony in Australia at the cost of the
long-suffering tax-payers of New South Wales.
By this scheme the ingenious, politician saved
some £4OO in postage alone bn the first issue, and
the device, by which a trade catalogue was
turned into a newspaper, has since been repeated
by various persons in a hundred different ways,
each more shameless and more elaborate than its
predecessor,
* * *
The colony of New South Wales is run solely in
the interests of Sydney. All the railway-lines
converge on the one centre, thus defrauding the
smaller ports of their share of the general trade
and gathering it in to swell the commerce of a
single overgrown city; the manufactures of the
whole nation are crushed by the policy of the
Government in order that the importers of York-
sfcreet may monopolise the sources of supply; and
the system of free newspaper postage was invented
to enable tlm newspaper owntrs ol the capital to
crush inland competition and to handicap the
journalists of the small provincial centres cut of
existence. The large city paper, thanks to its
great array of profitable advertisements and i,s
wide circulation, can be produced as cheaply as
the smaller country sheet, but the sordid press
adventurers of Sydney were not satisfied with
these advantages, and by means of all manner of
well-understood influences they succeeded in
effecting an arrangement by which the nation
was forced to bsar the cost of conveying their
wares throughout the country and distributing
them at every door. The State has sunk so low
as to act as iight porter to the warehouses of a
Fairfax and a Bennett, and yat it would he
difficult to define what public service these men
ever rendered that their goods should he humped
gratis through the length and breadth of the land.
Both are merely )he sons of their level-headed
fathers ; both are dull, commonplace persons who
inherited enterprises which the energy of their
predecessors had created, and who would appear
to much greater advantage as presidents of
corner groceries than as the formnlators of a State
policy, or as arbitrators of the value of literary
wares ; yet it is to swell the profits of these men
that the people at large are taxed to the extent
of £lOO,OOO per annum. The Herald, out of its
fathomless dullness, yields a profit of £BO,OOO
annually to its fortunate owners ; the News and
Journal return, probably, £40,000 yearly; the
Telegraph, run by a set of land-auctioneers—
the patriotism and self abnegation of whose
operations can be faintly guessed at in view of
what transpired at the Circular Quay taxpayer-
on-toast enquiry—and filled with the maunderings
of parsons who have turned their backs
on the service of God to edit fashion-
notes and to start a new policy every day and
turn dbg on it the next—aspires to some
day attain a similar level, and every year the
Post-Office accounts show another huge deficit in
order to enlarge the profits of these sordid traders.
No research could possibly reveal what the Sydney
Press has ever done to deserve the enormous sub-
sidy it receives. It has always voted consistently
for what it thought to be the winning side. It
has allowed citizens to go to the gallows without
the semblance of a fair trial. It sounded no
note of condemnation when an insane prisoner
was interviewed in his cell by a Minister,
who sought to trap him into an admission of
his guilt, while a newspaper shorthand-writer
took notes outside the door in order that the
doomed wretch’s ravings might be used to pro-
cure his own condemnation. It has always voted
against local industry because the importers who
ruled Sydney advertised in its columns ; and the
importers have in turn supported the principle of
free postage because by that means their adver-
tisements were carried gratis all over the colony,
thus obviating the necessity of paying for their
insertion in the country Press; and successive
Freetrade Governments have supported b3th par-
ties, and have loaded the taxpayers with the cost
of transmitting truik-loads of dismal maunder-
logs to every town and village throughout New
. outh * ales because by thac remans tney made
things right with the importers and right with the
Press and everything was quite correct all round
♦
The Sydney daily P.es3 is run for backsheesh,
not for principle, and it 1 * arrogance has risen to so
trem ndous a height through a long course of
political greising, that it refuses to bear its thare
of taxation in any shape or form. When, some
years ago, a certain Treasurer proposed to levy
a small duty cn printing-paper, one s-mi-illiterate
newspaper proprietor called at the Treasury and
thundered ou ; a threat that if the tax were imposed
he would proceed to smash the Government, and
when the morning tapers were accommodated
with a special train at a charge of fiiO.OOO a year
to the na ion, the evening papesa demanded a
similar concession for their own special benefit,
and dropped obscure hints that the Minist* r who
blocked them in. this new raid on the Treasury
would have cause to wish he had never been born.
The Sydney Press is hampered with libel-restric-
tions which would be held as intolerable in Eng
land or America, but instead of using their in-
fluence in the true interests of the Fourth Estate,
so that it may, when charged in the courts with
libel, have the same piivileges as a citizen charged
with slander, these Freetrade journalists sell
their hollow souls for dross —the Minister who
gives them special trains is written up as a
god, and the Minister who proposes to put a
small tax on their imported material is de-
nounced for ever afterwards as a fiend from the
nether slums of perdition. Some day, possibly,
the free-carriage system will be followed out to
its logical conclusion, at d then the gin from Post-
master-General Roberts's pub’ic-housewillba con-
veyed at the cost of the working classes, and Tiger
Ikglis’s tea will be placed on the N, S W. Post-
Office free-list alo-g with the wares retailed by the
Fairfaxes and the Uobmans and the Bennetts,
and with an equal claim to the privilege. The
latter gentlemen, it is argued, are subsidised for
the spread of knowledge, but they themselves
have no knowledge worth speaking of to spread,
and while they annex the subsidy, their subordi-
nates, who supply the small stock of unreliable
lore which escapes being crowded out by adver-
tisements about dubious infants for sale and
notices of sham “ consul ations,” have no shar* in
the steal The arrangement is iliogioal, > o say the
least. The country is taxed for the benefit of
mind, and mere matter appropriates the proceeds.
• * *
The argument that the public reap the profits of
the existing system is too transparent in its
hypocrisy to be worth considerat'on. The imposi-
tion of a postal charge would, no doubt, raise the
price of the city newspapers to country readers,
but the result would be that the latter would
immediately transfer their patronage to local
journals, and thus the great monopo’y of the
Sydney press syndicates would be serious'y in-
jured. As it is, the country papers of N,B.W. are
reduced to the lowest ebb, both intellectually and
financially, by the pressure of the great monopoly
which weighs them down. Most of them depend
entirely on the support of a single town, conse-
quently th?y derive no benefit whatever from the
boasted system which Parkes claims to have ori-
ginated, and, while themselves paying the expenses
cf distribution, they have to,com - ete against large
city journals, carried free in spe ial trains,
towards the cost cf which they have to con-
tribute in comm- n with their fellow-tax-
payers, and delivered at every door by the
State in its capacity of errand-boy to the
monopolists of Sydney. Sydney new-papers can
send tons weight of printed matter by rail, free,
while the country newspaper p T oprietorhasto ray
full railway freight on eyeiy ounce of print ng
paper consigned to him from Sydney. Under the
weight of such tremendous handicaps, few can
afford to pay for talent or even for decent
nsediccrity, and the country press, the re-
presentative of two-thirds of the rising nation,
struggles feebly along, scarcely earning bread
for the literary wanderers who endeavour to
maintain a hopeless battle against a body
of huge capitalists backed by the entire Trea-
sury of New South Wales. But the Sydney
importers demand the sacrifice, and the im-
porters rule the venal Government with a rod
of iron. Sydney lives by foreign trade, and its
interests require that the whole country should be
dependent on the outside world for its supplies in
order that this trade may not be impaired ; the
country, on the other hand, seeks to promote local
manufactures in order that its dismal, semi-
insolvent little townships may become centres of
industry, and, in the face of these conflicting
interests, the State must pay for the distribution
of the journals in which the beauties of Calico
Jimmyism are set forth, and in which the advan-
tages of being unemployed are made clear to the
meanest understanding.
• • •
The Sydney D.T., in writing upon the subject
of Mr. M‘iißhone's motion, suggests that a pro-
perty-tax would appropriately supply the place of
a postal charge cn newspapers. In other words,
it proposes that the brigands who profit by this
unholy raid on the Treasury—the bloated sons of
the horse-leech who defray the expenses of their
businesses out of the earningsof the masses—should
trade upon the State as before, and that a direct
tax should be put upon every form of wealth to
makeup the resulting shortage. On the same
principle, it might be argued, that the pirate or
the bushranger, instead of being suppressed,
should be allowed to pursue lua calling until he
has accumulated a fortune, and that a tax ehou'd
then be levied upoa those he has plundered, so
that he should be compelled, along with them, to
pay a fraction of his ill-gotten gains into the
'treasury. The argument is worthy of the sodden
intellect of the paper which originated it. To
pay it a higher compliment would:be an insult.
*" « *
The success of Mr. M’Elhone’s motion would
have involved to The Bulletin a less at least
as great as that of many of its city contempo-
raries, but this journal is fully prepared to face
any consequences which might arise from the
abolition of its old-established privilege. Should
The Bulletin ever feel it incumbent upon it to
loot the nation, it proposes to do it with a revolver
and a crowbar, instead cf plundering with a
moral text, a precept, a snufile - and, moat
potent weapon of all, a suppression A news-
paper has no more claim to be conveyf d at the
expense of the State than has a cabbage, a dress-
improver, a cask of Postmaster Roberts’s rum, or
a tin of opium, and if it cannot stand without
being shored up by a huge Government bribe, it
deserves to fall and die. Centralisation has long
been the curse of New South Wales, and the cen-
tralisation of journalism has been no inconsider-
able portion of the burden. When the artificial
suppoititnow enjoys is removed, the city Press
will find its own level for the first time, and if its
own merits are not sufficient for its support the
waste-paper basket of oblivion must bo its rofuge.
The Boucicauts
of capitalists and employers to-day
who in any way recognise the wrong which they
perpetrate on every form of Labour by means of
competition—robbing Labour of the worth of its
work and reducing its wages down to what will
barely support existence—is so small that we can-
not let one of them pass away without a few
wi rds of comment. The Ban March 6, or Cheap
E-tablishment of Paris, has achieved a reputation
more than local, more even than national. It is
the greatest drapery and millinery establishment
in Paris, perhaps in the world. The Boucicauts
—husband and wife —to whom it belonged, were
true children of the people. Madame Boucicaut
wes originally a washerwoman. The washer-
women of Paris, as readers of “ L 1 As ommoir 1
will remember, are a large class, and one which
suffers more and more from a cut-throat competi-
tion that makes the margin of profit in their
work grow ever less end less. The pitiless
rich or well to-do systematically go to the
cheapest workers, and the poor women chop
one another’s prices down till they end in giving
a'l their toil for nothing and barely cover the
expenses of material. The simple but shrewd
provircial girl saw all this, and when she met a
young Parisian workman whose head was full of
the wrongs of the people, who realised how the
robbery trick was worked by the rich, and who
saw in co-operation the.only means of resisting it,
she felt she had met the man who could satisfy
her soul. They were married, and the rest of
their lives was taken up in the effort to make
their theory of work practical and a success
Boucicaut would say (we have' heard him say
that he looked forward to the time when work-
men would co operate well enough to realise the
whole worth of their work. But this would bs
contemporary with the limitation of that equally
cut throat competition among employers which
was inevitably driving them on in their oppression
and plunder of their employes That time has not
yet come, but that it will yet come is the hops and
trust of every Socialist. Meantime, so soon as he
got the chance, Bouoic *ut intended to show to
what a much larger extent than anyone thought
possible, the system of recompensing employes
considerably above the current wage could be
successfully carried. He was nothing if not
practical, and he saw quite well that a willing
worker is worth two unwiling, and that to make
a willing worker you must change a plundered
slave into a man who feels 1 hat he is getting some-
thing like the worth of the work he puts in. All
along Boucicaut made those who worked under
him feel that they were a part of the concern, and
had a right to profit in its prosperity precisely ac-
cording to the amount and quality of their
contribution to it. The leap from a small bakery
in an obscure quarter to the Magasins of the
Bon March 6 is immense, hut the bridge is all of
one material, and that material is the persistent
effort to do justice. When Boucicaut died, he
lefc everything to the dear wife and friend who had
stood by him from the first, sharing every thought
and care. By this time, he had realised his
original scheme. Close on three and a-half
thousand employes worked iu hig magasins. All
were hoarded and lodged by him. All received
their share of the net annual profits by an elabo-
rate system of calculation. Sickness and retire-
ment were provided for, and even dismissal,
which only took place for a serious offence did
not rob the offender of what he had earned in the
past. Nevertheless, Boucicaut had amassed a huge
private fortune, and under his wife’s administra-
tion that fortune grew and grew. She held it,
she would say, as a tenure for the people. The
people — le peuple —the masse’, as we say in
Engii-h; always that— people! But she.re-
cognised, with her noble, stubborn practicality,
that you could only advance at a certain rate.
Generations of wrong have made the people un-
ready to take the management of their house
straight upon their hands at once. Owens’ ex-
periments of handing over his factories to the
workmen failed. Madame Boucicaut has made
possible the time when the Bon Marche, this
immense property, shall belong solely and entirely
to those who work it. Every farthing of her
private fortune is for (he people. She has edu-
cated them up to this point, and sbe believes that
the day is at hand when they can show, in
complete possession of what is their own,
the same faithfulness as she has shown as the
steward of it on their behalf. Paris has seen
no such sight as her funeral since Victor Huoo
lay under the Arc de Triomphe, and all France
stood bare-headed around. AH honour, reverence,
love to these two peerless souls—this man and
woman of the people who have wrought out for
their fellows such hope and trust. Kings and
queens, the greedy gluttons of a played-out breed,
grow mean beside them. Greasy “philanthropists,’’
who posed as petty God-Almighties and prated
of “ charity ’’and a free gift where they should
have whispered “ Justice ” and the restitution of
their robberies, what are such beside these simple,
serene figures of the French baker and the washer-
woman 1 All honour, reverence, and love to the
noblest man and woman of the day I
The United States of Australia.
The Bulletin has long advocated Protection,
but it has advocated Protection in the interests
of the Australian workman. In the vanguard of
every reform there are sure to be selfish reaction*
aides who join a movement for the sake of the
spoil. With such we have not, and never had,
any sympathy. The worst type of Protectionist
is the Sydney foreign-trade importer. Mato Pro-
tection the policy of New South Wales and the
foreign-trade importer becomes the manufacturing
monopolist clamouring loudly for 25 years’ protec-
tion a ainst the other colonies, in order that ho


in that period may make hia fortune and retire.
He little recks what dissension, what heart-
burning, what blocks have been thrown in the
road of Australian National Federation ; hia sel-
fish purpose has been served, and, for aught he
cares, the avalanche may follow. Nothing is it
to him that border-duties develop into border
wars; that the Custom-house officer be super-
seded by the armed patrol ; that seizures of con-
traband goods be but the prelude to the border
foray and the tightly raid. He has had hia 25
years of plenty ; the years of famine, of bloodshed
and internecine war are for another generation’s
reckoning. The colonist —be he Victorian,
Queenslander, South Australian, or native of New
South Wales—is not an Australian !
* * *
In 25 years such barriers could be raised be-
tween the various colonies as might never be
beaten down; such wounds inflicted as Time
would be powerless to heal; such sentiments bred
as would outlinger centuries of rapine and murder
and dominate the entire future of this Australian
continent. And why should this unnatural
division of Australia—a division effected years
since by a power 16,000 miles away—as absurd as
unnatural—to which geography could never assent,
and which can only be, while it endures, an
obstacle and a menace to Progress—be perpetuated
merely to benefit a selfish and egotistic minority
at the cost of the sacrifice of all the true interests
of that nation which we are ambitious to build
up beneath the Southern Cross ? Why is this
splendid and shining future -to be imperilled for
the benefit of a little commercial ring of would-
be monopolists as small in soul as it is in in-
fluence ? We admit the fact that other colonies
have erected customs-houses on their frontiers,
but is not the rapidly-growing and intense jealousy
thereby created a lesson to us to use every means
of breaking down rather than of raising up any
further barriers between peoples separated neither
by race nor by the geographical features of the
country ?
* * *
1 here was once a period when the whole Aut-
tralian continent was known generioally as Ne w
Holland, Botany Bay, or Sydney Cove, simply be-
cause civilised man had made a settlement on the
shores of Port Jackson and elsewhere his enter-
prise had not extended. The entire eastern shore
was called New South Wales, and continued New
South Wtfles until, in the course of time, Moreton
Bay and Port Phillip, as well as Port Jaokson,
were breathed upon by the breath of enterprise,
and they, too, became important settlements.
Diversity of interests brought about separation of
p rovlnces; Victoria and Q neensland became colonie s
ii their own right. South Australia and
Western Australia will go through a similar pr ,-
cess of dismemberment as soon as It is
discovered that different industries are cultivated
with the greatest success in different portions of
their territories. The present boundaries of the
various Australian colonies are purely artificial
The 142nd meridian of longitude is powerless as
gossamer to cut off Silverton and Broken Hib
from commercial alliance with Adelaide. The
Riverina is held in loyalty of a hypocritical char-
acter to Sydney by the ruse of the Freetrade
variety of Protection afforded by a cooked railway
tariff; but the Riverina is ever and anon menacing
secession, The vast West, git baring miles and
miles away from the Lachlau to the Darling, and
again northward to the remote outpost of Mil
parinka, and beyond to the arid Central Desert
sometimes refreshed by the intermittent waters
of the season-lived creeks; the great pastoral
West sees not its future or its hope in the per-
manence of Sydney or the prosperity of ’delaido.
It has, time and again, threatened insurrection
and withdrawal from the cast-iron colonial scheme
forged and welded by the quid-nuncs of Downing-
sbreet, London, and fastened and fitted by th-
Imperial officials sent out by them, on to the
shoulders of this Southern Continent. Glen Innes
and Grafton look to Brisbane as their natural
seat of Government, and Townsville persists
in claiming her right to the title of capital of
Northern Queensland, although if the Carpentarian
country continues to be populated, and its mines
ouninue to be developed as of late. Northern
Queensland’s capital will be far distant from
Townsville, welch may then agitate for the dis-
tinction of the chief city of General Queensland,
and so on Jhe settlers and pioneers of the
Northern Territory are fludin s oat speedily enough
that their interests are set aside by the Chinese-
loving syndicates who rule from Adelaide, and
the gold district of Kimberley can expect in the
futu e little sympathy from a remote southern
city like Perth. Everywhere is there dismember-
ment, and this spirit of disintegration is the
motive force and life-blood of Australian federa-
tion. Pro serve the “ colonies ’ and the national
spirit must die 1 Facilitate the destruction of the
‘ ‘ colonial" spirit with the colonial mapped territory
and the reconstruction of the colonies into small
states, and the idea of an United Australia will
have become a reality.
* * •
The Imperialists desire nothing better than the
maintenance of the present irrational divisions—
it insures a permanence of Imp rial rule. The
Freetraders know this and point out triumphantly
that Protection against each other amongst the
colonies is tantamount to a declaration of war.
But Imperialistic fcreetreders and Imperialistic
Protectionists can both of them be checkmated by
apolicy cf rrote ction for Auslraliaagalnstthe world
with a policy of Freetrade between the colonies.
England’s greatest datire for a “closer union ”
springs from a commercial reason. England
wants a market for her manufactured goods. Let
the colonies close their ports, and England is abso-
lutely battled, ana intercolonial Freetrade, by de-
stroying int rcDloaial jealousy, would destroy her
last remaining hope of a vast coerced empire in
the south. then would Australia be in truth a
nation. Suppose each colony g -anted to its con-
stiuent electorates a full measure of local self-
government, the present absurd boundaries, sanc-
tioned not by G ographyand unblessed by Nature,
would melt aw y into a diaphanous adumbration
of s m thing more impalpable than smoke ; men
would cease io bo Victorians, Queenslanders,
South uslrallans, and naives of ew South
Wales and, like the inhabitants of America, they
would take the great and comprehensive title of
their country, they would boast of being Austra-
lians ; Sir John Robertson, and like malcontent
mischief-contrivers, would bo gathered to
the sarcophagi of their fathers, and the
men, whom they, by fomenting the petty
jealousies and little envies which disgrace the
name of man, seek to dlvlds, would rally by
a common impulse, to a common battle-cry,
around a common standard; the sentiment ol
nationality would then be concreted in practice
and in action, and the United States cf Australia
would become name on the muster-roll of
nations.

The American civil war was one of the finest
sights presented to the gaze of humanity in the
panorama of heroic endeavour. Would such a
grand victory for the right have been
possible had the principle of Protection bsen
applied by state against state ? Hardly!
Freetrade amongst (30,000,000 of people and
Protection against the world has been the
policy waioh has ensured bo tte United States a
continuance of unique and, indeed, almost un-
exampled prosperity in the commercial bistory of
the wo ild. Instead of urging retaliatory mea-
sures of Protection, let us endeavour to persuade
the various colonies to join us against the out-
side world on a basis of reciprocity. For the
measure of Protection proposed affects only
-Sydney. If it is good to encourage the Sydney
monopolist in his demand for Protection against
the Melbourne monopolist, why should we be
deaf to the cry of Riverina, to the prayers of tbs
West, to the discontent of the Hunter and the
muttered threats of New England? This ques-
tion is an Australian question. It is the question
of Nationalism versus Parochialism, and with the
issue the future of Australian nationality is
involved.

Whan we are ripe for union ; when the dif-
ferent colonial centres of local self-government
become the nuclei of many little states, it must
not be imagined by the inhabitants of New
South Wales that they will take the lead in ruling
and guiding the confederation., for then there will
be no New South Wales. Pahkes, who now
when he catches sight of the reflection of
his bulky form in a plate glass window, puts up a
mental apostrophe to the future President of the
United States of Australia, makes a prophetic
blunder. He sees therein the inflection of only
the possible future Governor of the State o£ Cum-
berland —if he lives long enough—in no way more
important than Gov. Melville of the adjoining
State of N ji thumberland;carrying with him no more
political weight than the Governor of Monaro, or
the Governor of Rosebery or Palmerston in the
distant North, of Gawler or Hindmarsh, of
Maranoa or North Kennedy, of Stirling or
Kimberley, of Ualhoufle or Talbot. Sydney will
then be only a capital of a sta*e, like Newcastle,
or Melbourne, or Brisbane, or Perth, or Adelaide,
or Wilcannia. Local State-Government leaves
little for a centralised Government to do beside i
roll departmental logs and grind political axes’.
Washington’s machinery of administration, like
an empty stomach, is forced to prey upon itself,
and j jba have to be manufactured for its states-
men to waste tneir energies up on. Therefrom a
lesson might be learnt by the unborn States of
United Australia. We want no c ipitol! Each state
io turn might he selected as the seat of central
government. Thus here would be no assum otion
of permanent dominance and jealousy wouldbsim-
possible. There would be medcdn i standing aim/,
no glare, no glitter, no State-house, no psuedo-
nationil frippery, no imperial navies proudly
wafted to victory—or Sheol —under the direction
of a foreign admiral. Every citizen might be a
soldier. It would be no loss to the nation if every
man who boasted its name was able to protect it
—perhaps from some future Invasion of German
descended New Guineans. But there need be
none of the bespangled paraphernalia of sham
regality—no jubilees, no naval subsidies, no vice-
regal cohorts of tinselled lancers —barbers in mufti
—no unveiling of queen’s statues, no banquets to
peripatetic noblemen; no fireworks, no fancy -
tlnted flame ; no cultivation of false sentiments ;
no grovel; no shams !

The Australian nation is coming! Swifter,
perhaps, than the Machiavellians of Downing-
street imagine. The Democratic party with each
day grows stronger. The Australian nation is
approaching more rapidly every year—like the
avalanone, its speed increases during the prrgres i
of descent. With its advent the past fales away
into oblivion. The errors and follies, the crimes,
the blood-hued butcheries of the convict-days ;
the rule of the New South Wales Corps and of
their descendants, with all the inhuman traditions
of lash and gallows, pale in the rosy hue of the
approaching dawn of Australian national indepen
dence. But before the sun rises the work of the
night must be accomplished. We meat destroy in
order to re-create ; break down to re-construct;
divide to rule. New South Wales will lose her
hated memories with her disrasteful name
when she shall merge through the media
of her states into the coveted status of an integral
part of an indurated whole —Australia will not
then represent jealous provinces with diverse in-
terests, but a vast confederacy of united cantons
bound together'by the broad band of a notional
sentiment. “ Australia for the Australians ” will
nob then be used to gather a crowd round the
feet of a demagogue, but it will be the motto of
a c ontlnent; it will typify a sentiment of pro-
gress which carries Protection against the world
in its van, and Land Nationalisation in its wake ;
it will summarise and embody a faith intense as
that embodied in the idea of Holy Russia ; it will
be the spring of national action, and men will dare
danger and couit death for the principle it an-
nounces, and women wiU withhold their smile
ftom these who may betray it; to-day It may be
nothing more than a catch phrase, but the day
will oome when the ground shall tremble with the
trampling of men who gather at its bidding to
hurl into the sea the plague inflicted upon ns by
the Imperial connection and our own disnnited-
ness, and our country will be freed of the curse of
the leper by those from whose lips comes only a
sentence —“Australiafor the Australians.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Alliance -Wool and Shoddy.
“Freetrade” in New South Wales being in a
desperate fix is forced to resort to desperate ex-
pedients. As Freetrade and Pahkks cannot hope
much longer to stem the risir g tide of wrath, a
new and powerful ally has been let in to the con-
spiracy against the country. The new-comer is
that confusion-creator of local politics, the always-
dissatisfied squatter. The i rice of his support is
to bo the tee-simple of his holding, the gift being
effected by a gradual process described by the
specious title of " compensation for improve-
ments ” There was in the condition of the country
a strong reason for the consummation of this con-
spiracy. The Freetrade policy, whatever may ba
its redeeming points, has a shocking tendency to
unemployment of the working classes. The
more “ commercial freedom ” prevails the more
do the armies of the unemployed increase. And
in their misery these idle ones rail at the policy
which took away their means of maintaining in-
dependence, and by their complaints cause much
indignation to centre upon Moses Pglsford and
Aaron Parkes, who are leading them around the
tuckerless Freetrade wilderness. To satisfy or
silence the meanings of these miserable ones
became a necessity ; some attempt had to
be made to provide work for th i multitude,
and something likewise had to be done to prop
up the staggering Parkesian party. To catch the
squatter vote nothing more was required than the
promise of compensation for improvements, and
this concession will, it is averred by the pas
toralists, create anew and enormous demand for
labour, a. double object will thus be achieved by
the grant of this so-called “tenant-right"— the
wool-kings will prop up the rule of the shoddy-
kings, and the unemployed will be placated by
dam-sinking and fencing-work. The Bulletin
has long since demonstrated the fact that “tenant
right ” for the squatters is only a new method of
oublic robbery ; the pastoral tenants have made
their bargain—presumably an equitable one—for
the leasing of the lands they occupy. It is now
proposed to review this contract and grant a new
advantage to the lessee, and that an advantage
which would give a freehold of tne lands leased.
That is one side of the iniquity of this unholy
alliance. With regard to the question of increased
employment for labour at present superfluous,
there are many points to be considered. It can
scarcely be urged, for instance, that this new area
of employment would he productive of wealth to
the community. For, although many new dams
would be dug, and many new fences erected,
these would go to increase the pastoralists’ power
to blackmail the Treasury—to obtain the freehold
of the land much more than to increase its pro-
ductiveness.
Two Pictures.
England is the land of contrasts. Vast wealth
shoulders away unutterable poverty. The 37
millions are run in the interests of 37 thousands.
Once it was all for birth—the “ upper ten thou-
sand.” The eldest sons were millionaires, and the
I ounger sons lived on the sinecures of the “ pro-
fessions,” the Army, the Navy, the Bar, the
Church, That has been modified somewhat, and
the greatest; tyranny to-day is not that of Birth
but of Wealth. Pitiless competition has reduced
wages to the life-line, and now everything is con-
ducted in the interest of the Capitalists as it oaco
was of the Aristocrats. The robbers and the
robbed, the possessors and the dispossessed, the
swindlers and the swindled —behold them cheek-
by-j owl!
The marriage of Mist Ger-
trude R'omilly, youngest
daughterof Lady Elizabeth
Romilcy, to Mr. Harrt
Stewart (Gordon High-
landers), which was cele-
brated at St. Gabriels
-Church, Warwick Square,
was a very gay affair. The
Princess Christian was
present, and there was a very
select compin'/ of friends and
relations, including the Duke
and Duchess of Bedford,
the Earis of Minto and
Airlie, the Countesses Rus-
sell and Spencer. Lord
and Lady Roicilly, and
Lady Charlotte Portal,
The bride wore a diets of
ivory white satin, trimmed
with fine old Brussels lace,
and veil to match fastened
by a diamond crescent, the
gift of the bridegroom The
six brides naids were prettily
dressed in pale yellow satin,
trimmed with white lace, and
wore Liberty hats to snatch,
and bronze shoes and stock-
ings embroidered in gold.
Each carried a basket of
bronzs and gold cbrysanths-
mums, tied with Gordon tar-
tan ribbons, and among their
ornaments were diamoad
safety-pin brooches, the gift
of the bridegroom.
A horrible discov iry ia re-
porbsd from Lambeth. Police-
constable John Edwards,
81 L dlvisi >n, was called to a
house in Glasshouse-street
when he fouud the body of a
woman lying on the floor in
a small bac* room, dead, bat
not cold. He at once went
for Dr. George Frederick
Farr, the divisional surgeon
of the L division of polio-*,
who states that in all his ex-
perience he never before wit
neased such a horrible sight
as this roam presented wit a
two human beings in it. The
dead woman was lying up n
the floor, with a few illtfcy
rags clinging to her t ereon,
but so dirty and emaciated
that it would be impassible
to guess her age. On pro-
ceeding t } examine the body,
which he found still warm,
he noticed something moving
close by the d >ad womans
side under a piece cf sacking,
on removing which a still
more horrible sight presented
itself—a man, who was stated
to fie the husband of the
dead woman, being found,
alive in the same filthy an i
emaciated state, too ex
hausted to rep’y to any cue)
tiona put to htm. The doc
tor, considering his case
critical, ordered bis imme-
diate removal to the psrish
infirmary, where he was
taken.
Here are two pictures taken at random from the
assortment of their fellows. Such things occur
every week in London, nay, every day. They
arouse no comment—they are coo familiar. The
appalling iniquity, whereby the easa and luxury
of the few is drawn from the toil and degradation
of the many, is not apparent. The fact Is accepted
as the fact of the weather or any natural pheno-
menon. But this is not to he so for ever. The
classes slumber, bat the masses slowly awake, and
then woe to these social assassins and thieves !
In that hour to be,
The hour of oar desire,
Wh at shall onr slayers be ?
As the stubbie to the Are!

Protection to the Lawyers.
Recently the New South Wales Parliament
passed a Banaruptcy Act wherein was inserted a
provision which, being a long-sought-for innova-
tion, was hailed with satisfaction by a large num-
ber of people. Hitherto the right of audience in
all Australian courts of law has been restricted to
lawyers who have always been extra watchful to
prevent any encroachment on their preserves
Several attempts have been m ide in various Par
Laments to introduce a principle which has worked
so well in America and other places—that of
allowing non-professional agents to appear in
cases in which technicalities were not involved.
When the Bankruptcy Act was before the New
South Wales Assembly the party of reform seized
the opportunity, and, de-pite the fierce opposition
of the legal members, an amendment was agreed
to providing that certain proceedings might
be conducted by a “ creditor’s representative
authorised in writing,” The conservative mem-
bsrsof ihel’pper Hon e, true to the time honoured
custom of that body, did not care about conceding
the whole of this desirable reform at once, a,ad
they struck out the word “ representative'* aad
inserted the words “manager, acooun ant or
cle'k.’’ Tne Assembly would not give way on the
poini. and in the message seat to the Council
drafted andpropo .ed by Attorney-General Wise
—it was stat ed that the Council's amendment was
objectod to be anse “ it was thought to limit un-
necessarily the privilege of a creditor in appearing
by another at the examination of a bankrupt.
Nothing could be clearer, therefore, than that
Parliament meant 'be word “representative ’t
have a gane-al application ; hut bare aga n Mr.
R ngnose Wise has shown tnat ha is a lawyer first
and a patriot afterwards, if at all. He is th
editor of a book on the new N.S.W. B nkruptcy
Act, in whi h, dealing with this particular pro
vision, he says - -
The « ord ‘ represantative ” has bean held in England t
apply tj a solicitor, who mu t, therefore, if required pr
duce an au.hority from the’cr. ditor : cut they do net apxl
to a barrister. It is questionable wh ther the term inolidi
any agent or clerk of tne creditor, since they cannot be tral
saidtj' represaut’ the creditor. To extend the term (re-
presentative) to include agents, would be practically to ovei-
ride the acts which limit the right of audience in the
Supreme Court to officers of the Court over whom the Court
o an exercise control.
This is legal quibbling quite worthy of the ex-
Attorney-General. This interpretation may be
sound law, but nevertheless it is uncommonly bad
common-sense. Giving Mr. Wise credit for the
expression of an honest opinion as a lawyer, he
stands convicted ,as a politician of having deli-
berately misled Parliament. One of the most im-
portant duties of an Attorney-General is to watch
the progress of legislative measures in order
to see that Parliament gives correct legal
expression to its views. According to Mr
Wish, Parliament has not done so in this
instance, and if that be the case he is solely
responsible for the blunder. The question will
Slava to be decided by the Supreme Court, and it
is to be hoped hat the Judges will tate a rational
view of it and discard the greedy, grasping, sel-
fish, ultra-protective motive which seem i 10 have
prompted ohe extraordinary opinion given by Mr
Wise.

The Chinaman Is hot to Go.
The Chinaman is not to go after all. The Aus-
tralian fore gn-traier cannot spare his yellow ally,
and even when tha force of the public wrath com-
pelled the Free trade par y to make a pretense of
hostility to the jaotdice-colourtd aposilo of uu-
limitl d competition, The Bulletin prophesied
tn*t every preoautioa wou.d be taken to let the
bland Asiatic down easily. The result shows that
he is to be let down even more easily than was
autuipated. IVe Northern TVmtory of Australia
is now a huge Mongolian colony, in whica the
white Australian is outnumbered in the ratio of
ten to one by a s ant-eyed race of lepers, whose
Joss has taken deep root in the soil, and where
the Whiteman’s alleged GoDisbo wledoutb j deities
stuffed with hay. Ic is not worth wnile being a
European ia the Territory; the whole trade of
that fertile region is in ths hands of the pig-tailed
raca; the mineral flecls are rushed with them;
the whole land is yellow with the procession of
aliens who are swarming to take possession of
the ruby-mines ; ttyo or three times a momh a
huge steamer comes in from China, and shoots
down a few hundred more slaves on the wharves;
even the transcontinental railway works are
oairied on solely by low-priced heathens, as
provided by Government contract, and the
white trash ’ are told to go and starve; and
the country is full of Chinese epidemics and Chinese
horrors. Port Darwin has one of the finest
climates in Australia, and it gives access to tne
richest lauds and tha richest mineral-fields on the
Continent; its harbour, too, is one of the best in
the South Pacific, but the land is held almoso en-
tirely by syndicates of speculators who make their
profit oat of the Asiatic companies which export
their slaves by thousands to the Territory, and
t.eice pass them over the borders Into the adja-
cent colonies, and the Mongols, gaining confidence
by their numbers, tre it the “ white devil j ” with
derision, and systematically close every avenue of
industry against them. And, in the face of these
stupendous evils, the Government of Adelaide has
reluctantly resolved to oppose the invasion of ihe
lepers by the imposition of a poll-t.x of £lO ptr
htad ! The amount, ic is well-known, wi 1 not be
paid by one heathen out of every five ; the rest
will enter as free “ Bhtish ” citizens from Hong-
Aong, or will present the receipts obligingly for-
warded by their brethren ia Australia, and will
the ii end bact the papers to serve for the im-
portation of a fresh cargo of’human scum ; and,
even supposing the duty to he codec ted in every
case, it represents nothing moie than the differ-
ence in the wages of ihe Mongol and the Austra-
lian for a space of rather less than two months.
Even the lady who opposed her broom to
the rising tide of the Atlantis canmt compare
for fathomless imbecility to the politicians who
thus propose to stay a cataract with a straw.
The pretence is too hollow to deceive even the
ignorant Ah Sue himself, and the object of the
measure is simply to allay the storm of public in-
dignation without inflicting the slightest material
injury on the horde of unprincipled speculators
who are building up fortunes by the importation
of Chinese slave labour into the Territory. The
Adelaide Government has shown itself a traitor
to the interests of Australia by this act of miser-
able hypocrisy or dismal folly, and unless the
lepers who swarm and multiply at Port Darwin
are ultimately to overrun the whole Continent it
will he necessary for the united nation to bring
suen pressure to bear as will shut the back-doer
of Australia against the race for e re r,

The Townsville ;Q.) Telegraph, a rampant
organ of Imperialism, pounds out a few observa-
tions :
Certain Southern papers, some conducted by avowed
enemies of the Empire, which may be said to exist by ecur-
rili y, and pauderiog to what is most base and unworthy in
hum.n nature, delight to represent England as a very leech,
draining the life-blood of her colonies, and even stoop to dis-
gusting cartoons attacking the person of the Sovfreign.
Politicians, seeking somewhat unworthily to catch a por ion
of the public ear, sometimes endeavour to tickle the imagina-
tion of th-ir hearers by pictures of the future independence
■of Australia Other papers have taken to discuss the matter
from a calm and phiknophio standpoint, and although we do
not think it is set a burning question in the public mind, wj
agree with them that it is one to be faced sooner or later.
We go so far as to believe that some day Austr ha will be
divided into two parties, namely Separatists and Unionist!,
There is a melancholy backing-down in these re-
marks. A paper devoted to English interests ad-
mits that tire time is coming when Kepublicans
and Imperialists will base evenly balanced in aus-
cralia that other parass will be obliterated, an i
politics will become a duel between the two.
Hooray I This means that the Australian Party
is so steadily' rising and the imperialist one so
steadily sinking that they will one day find them-
selves on a level. If the movement stop! there
the Imperial connection may possibly he main-
tained a little while longer, but such a stoppage is
impossible. The party which has risen so far will
continue to rise, and the sinning pirty' to sink,
and even tha organs of Monarchy can see the
inevitable result. Probably tha only man who
fails to get even a glimmering of the truth is
Primate Alfred Ba r by, of whom tha S.M.
Herald writes ; ~
In his sermon at the cathedral yesterday afternoon, the
Primate said that in some form or other we all feel that the
unity of tne. E tipire muss be maintained if our ra >e is to
bold its own in eaese cays of gig.ntic nationalities, and
play tne great part which uou in ms providence ia obviously
preparing for ns,
the Primate here gives a very straight hint as to
what he would do if he were the Lord, and sug-
gests mildly to tha Deity that, if He wants
ta mass Australia great, He can only do it
by fixing her firmly to England, At the same
tima, it is just possible that Providence knows
what it ia about better than Alfred Barry, and,
anyway, there is a chance that it may decline to be
shoved by any mortal and may goto work its own
way And, j ust supposieg chat Providence takei
no notice of the Bishop s hint, then wnat the
deuce is h> g ling to do about it ? The Bi hop, by
the way, purpi es acting up to his cr ed, aid
whether Auatrali a is annexed to England or not
he proposes to annex himself to that country
shortly. He has »ept his eye on Providence in
this part of the world for a good while, and now
he gives the Higher Power a hint how to manage
things in his absence, and solemnly packing up
his reverend carpet-bag he prepares to “ get."


HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
Anyone with the slightest experience in
the sitting of evidence or the examination of his-
torical records will see at a glance the value of
the claims put forward by John Macarthur and
his party. The unparalleled impudence of the
attempt whica has been made to exalt them to
the pedestals of patriots would only be possible
in a country where the term itself is one of ridi-
cule and derision. The Australian patriot has
the great advantage over those of other lands in
tha'j he has known how to make the trade pay.
Patriotism has been defined elsewhere as the last
refuge of the scoundrel; in Australia it has
always been the first trick of the huckster—political
or otnerwlse. The term has such unsavoury as-
sociations that it stinks in the nostrils of Austra-
lians.
* * *
It requires courage to deal vigorously
with these first chapters of our history, and par-
ticularly with the character of such a man as
this John Macarthur. Long before his death his
wealth— acquired as we know —gave him a com-
manding influence in the growing colony, as we
shall see as we go on. His influence was need, np
to the last, against the people of this country, and
some of tne worst and most despicable passages
in that part of our story that is to follow wi 1 he
found connected with his name, as were those
that have been already told. That such a man
and his accomplices should have continued to oc-
cupy their false position so long is a serious
charge against writers of Australian history, as
well as the popular spirit c£ enquiry which has
allowed these drivellers to mislead it. Miserable
attempts have been made in the face of facts to
glczi over and conceal Macarthur’s delinquencies
because he introduced the practice of wool-grow-
ing ; in view of which, says one of his apologists,
“ the faults of the man have bsen almost forgot-
ten in the patriotism of the citizen." ’Jhe
“ patriotism of the citizen ” consisted in his laying
the foundations of his own private fortune. Aus-
tralia has had many patriots like that!
* • *
“ The genius of New South Wales,”
Bonwick writes, “ as if in Imitation c£ the pitying
tear of the recording angel, has blurred the page
that told of John Macarthur s errors, while light-
ing up by her smiles the letters which blazoned
forth his glorious deeds in the path of peaceful pro-
gress," This hopeless cant is a fair sample of
the saponaceous idiocy on which the public senti-
ment of the Australian people has been hitherto fed.
Such is the dismaldriveithatmarks ourreesrdfrom
the beginning, and stamps it with its own fatuous
character, which it will continue to retain until
the Australian voter and taxpayer is able to think
for himself. It is for this reason that the writer
who would set the facts of our history in their
proper place and order, must cull them laboriously
from manifold sources, taking facts alone and
leaving behind him the wildermss of dreary plati-
tude and veneered venality in which they have
been hitherto embedded and concealed.
•- # *
The facts of the Bllgh case, candidly told,
are a sufficient condemnation of the officers. They
sold goods, having dishonestly obtained by fraud
and force the command of the market, at a
usurious profit running up to 1500 per cent. ; they
robbed the poorer settler of the produce o’his labour
for a t ithe of its value, and they demoralised the
settlement with licentiousness and rum. Bllgh,
as we have seen, had express instructions to stop
some tf these inquities, and his honest efforts in
that direction aroused the trading officers’ enmity.
They put in force against him the same vile tactics
—mere appropriate to a gang of thieves and pick-
pockets, which they were, than to British officers
and gentlemen, which they certainly were not—
that had driven Phillip, Hunter, and King out of
the colony, and for many years ruined its chance
of progress. When they found that Bligh waj a
stronger man than any of hia predecessors, and
shrewd enough to recognise the moving spirit
of all their rascality and put him in gaol, then the
officers and their worthy followers deposed the
Governor “in the public interest." The facts of
the deposition itself are damnatory. Johnstone
was too ill to write to the Governor, but not so
ill as to he unable to write to the gaoler at
Sydney, ordering him to deliver Macarthur at his
peril—thus compelling the performance of an
illegal action under a direct threat, which the
gaolef knew only too well how to appreciate.
Johnstone was too ill to attend BHgh’s summons,
but not too ill to come Into town the same after-
noon and depose him. He charged Bllgh with
crimes that rendered him unfit to exerc’se the
supreme authority another moment in the colony ;
but he forebore to say what these crimes were.
From first to last, as was clearly proven at the
court-martial later on, this man was a mere in-
strument in the hands of Macarthur, who in-
stigated Johnstone to hia squalid rebsllion for his
own miserable purposes. He found ha had gone
too far with Bllgh, and, being afraid to take his
trial, he moved his weak-minded superior officer
to rebel against the Governor so that ho himself
might get out of trouble and out of gaol.
# * *
The action of Colonel Paterson, who cer-
tainly knew the state of affairs in the colony well,
and understood the charac er of his officers and
men, has a significance of its own. Teat officer
refused, point blank, to have any act or part in
the “ rebellion,” when hn heard of what had been
done. Yet it is impossible to believe that he
would have held aloof had the circumstances
been, as Macarthur and Johnstone described
them, such as to warrant recourse to the extreme
measures taken by the Corps. The fantastic
tricks played before high heaven by the persons
who officiated as ordinary, chaplain, acd the
solemnlser of marriages would, perhaps, make
the angels weep were they not better employed.
All authorities agree (hat the debauchery and
licentiousness of the officers knew no bounds.
Many of them, we are told, kept regular harems
of convict women, and very few indeed held aloof
from these shameless excesses, which, like every-
thing else connected with these men, were squalid
and revolting, without one redeeming point or
featnre of extenuation. It is but fair to add that
Macarthur was one of those of whom least has
been charged in this particular connection.
# ♦ *
The prosecution of Gore and Crossley was
a piece of revengeful vindictiveness for which
ther can bo no pal-ia! ion. Because Crossley as-
sisted to draw up the indictment! against Mao
aribur, and Gore tcok him from the hands of the
soldiers who bed forcibly rescued him, both were
sent to the coal mines of Newcastle by the malice
of the canting ordinary, who had the audacity to
insert special prayers in the Church Service for
the instrument of his mean revenges. The case
of Suttor was still worse. He was an Industrious
settler at Baulkham Hills, and no sympathiser
with the alms and schemes of the officers. He
and several others addreesad a memorial to the
Homo Government disclaiming any part in their
action, and for' this he was deprived of his as-
signed servants and locked up for six months in a
condemned cell. Every extreme of malice seems
to have been put forward by the officers while
their power lasted to intimidate those who were
disaffected to their illegal rule, and to revenge
themselves cn all who had sought to strengthen
the hands of Bllgh in his short-lived but well-
meant efforts to remedy some of the miseries of
the unhappy settlement.
* * *
Bligh remained under strict surveillance
until March, 1809, when he was allowed to take
command of H.M.S. Porpoise on condition that he
returned to England at once. He accepted the
condition, but he appears to have thought little
of a promise obtained under such circumstances,
and bv such people, for he sailed to Van Diemen’s
Land. There is a story that when Blisth felt the
timbers cf his ship onoe more under bis feet, he
threw off all disguise and ordered Lieutenant
King to open fire and “batter down the town of
Sydney.” as well as to turn his guns against the
Admiral Gambler, then lying in the harbour, in
which Macarthur and Johnstone had taken pas-
sage for England to forestall him in the enquiry
they anticipated. At Van Diemen’s Land BUgh
was well received at first, until letters oance from
Sydney when an attempt was made to arrest him.
He escaped, and lay off the coast till the end of
the year, when Macquarie arrived to succeed him
as Governor on 28th December. Macquarie had
orders to reinstate Bligh for 24 hours had he been
present in Sydney on his arrival; when he did
come soon after he was received with the honours
due to a Commodore. By the new Governor
Bligh received despatches from Lord Caetlereagh
informing him that “ the mutinous outrage com-
mitted upon him bad caused the strongest sensa-
tion and that His Majesty had ordered Major
Johnstone to he sent home in strict arrest, to be
brought bo trial for his conduct.” He was em-
powered to bring home with Mm any witnesses
whose services he should require “to substantiate
the charge of that officer’s mutinous proof ediogs."
Bligh arrived In Sydney In January, 1810, and
left on the following May. By October, when he
arrived in England, there had been a change of
Ministry, and in the meantime his enemies had
been beforehand with him in blackening Ms
character and prejudicing his ease in the public
estimation. It was not until May, 1811, that the
Court-Martial was held, by which time the matter
had become an old-world story, and the new
Ministry had lost any small interest its members
had ever taken in such a far away matter.

finds that he cannot hang on to office without bringing into
action the reserves of religious bigotry with which it is his
custom to bolster up shaky political principles. Seeing
this, the bulk of the Catholics no doubt vote against
Parkes. The Irish, besides, remember that Freetrade
Britain has ruined the industries of their country in the in-
terests of the English commercial ring. Apart from this,
there is to special reason why a N.S.W. Roman Catholic

“Jess,” which commenced its career at
Sydney Gaiety on Saturday, is a drama which
requires to be treated by a naked aboriginal critic
with a club. According to the programme dis-
pensed by the talented attendant at the door, the
piece was adapted from Rider Haggard's novel of
that name by the combined efforts of Messrs.
Dampler and Wrangham. “Jess” is drawn out
into six acts, and filled with the most melancholy
gush ever constructed by any man who aspired to
scrag a work of moderate ability and make the
writer wish that a drav had rolled over his head
at an early age. It contains 12 characters, who,
in their language and their actions are as dismal
as 8100 cjutd reasonably bo expected to be. Most
of them seem to have been inserted in a
frenzied effort to give a f yle to the proceedings,
and tha show is conducted on such a lavish
scale that when a lady, who is of no account
In the story, comes on to make a remark
which Isn’t worth making anyhow, six able-
bad ted citizens come along behind her to hear
her do it. Having fulfilled this mission they are
apparently thrown away, for except that one of
them afterwards hollers at a court-martial they
are not used any more. The scene is laid
In the Transvaal at the time of the Boer
war, and when the badly-licked, narrow-chested
boys from British factories are shut up in
Pretoria the Boer officers drop in upon them in the
most casual way and cheek the entire garrison. It
is the custom, of course, in modern v arfare, when-
ever a British army is hemmed in, for the enemy's
generals to shin over their defences in open day-
light and examine the condition of things Inside,
and then roost on the walls and call the defenders
bad names and go slowly away without being
shot, but the practice is so demoralising that we
are sorry to see ib encouraged on the stage.
Farther, it would have been better if the little
Frenchman from “ Allan Qaatermain” had not
befn cadged and turned into a Dutchman, and
when the author borrows that scene frem “ Held
by the Enemy,” In which Nelson Decker used to
fall into the stage over the ruins of a blown-up
wall, it would be wiser for him to taka it as
originally written and not try to improve it by
making six men fall through the hole instead of
one. It doesn’t make the incident six times
better by a long way. The most striking scene in
the whole drama la the raging flood of the Yaal
River, but the flood at its best doesn’t rage half
so much as the audience. The saddest dialogue
ever invented outside a sarcophagus ii padded
with ponderous maxims which have no more con-
nection with the story than the Prodigal Son had
with the ulterior circumstances which lead to cold
feet ; possibly the piece might be roused into
activity by a charge of shot fired into the
hinder part of it, but we have our doubts. Miss
Lily Dampler wastes a lob of good acting in the
endeavour to hold up this dead-horse of literature,
and Messrs. Bootiunan, Lesion, Sbcneham, and
Baker do good work in various blind and para-
lysed parts. A quantity of valuable scenery Is
also cast before swine.

“ In the ‘Ranks,” at Her Majesty’s (Syd-

Cable advises the death of John Clayton,
the well-known London actor and manager, who
has probably knocked under to a chronic throat-
affection. Clayton first came to the front about
18 years ago, la Robertson's comedy “Dreams,”
p!ayl> g the part of a handsome “ heavy swell ’’ as
no other man ever will play it again. At that
time, and for some few years afterwards, he pre-
sented a stage appeaiance that was an edition de

Previous to taking co-managtment of the Court
Theatre (where he brought out Pinero’s I'ght
comedies) this obese Adonis made a sound reputa-
tion as Dazzle, Joseph Surface, and notably as
Hugh Trevor in “All for Her.” He divided
honours with Charles Warner in the first produc-
tion of “ Los Danlscheffs,” and afterwards sup-
ported Irving in “Richelieu” and a melodrama
called “ Philip " A certain morning performance
of “Philip" will never be forgotten by the
writer cf this In the one powerful scene
of the play, Irving, carrying a loaded gun,
was taunted Into suddenly shooting his younger
brother, Clayton, who had to fall apparently
dead. Irving then spread a handkerchief over
his brother’s upturned face, and crept, horror-
stricken, up a mountain pat s as the curtain fell. On
the occasion in question something had gone
wrong with Irving’s gun, and the trigger was
pulled in vain. He snapped it two or three times
and said “ D n the gun," but not the ghost of
a report would that miserable weapon throw off.
Under the circumstances, there was nothing for
Clayton to do but to fall down without showing
any just cause or reason (or his (ate, so down he
went. But while Irving was covering up the
poor ghastly face, you could sea the victim's
majestic stomach wobbling like a jelly in an earth-
quake and the frightened fratricide could hardly
creep up the mountain for laughing. Helgho ! all
that happened in the happy long ago. John Clay-
ton was brother-in-law to Dot and Nina Bouci-
cault, having married the great Dion's eldest
daughter, Eva Boucloault. His family name was
Calthrop, and he was brother to a pretty well-
known painter, Calthrop, R. A. The world could
have better spared a less imposing-looking man.

Essie Jenyns, according to a gushing
article in the Melbourne D.T., has a “ passionate
love for the profession into which she may be said
to have been born " —but, for the information of
Essie’s admirers, The Bulletin begs to rise to a
point cf order. She is the daughter of Dr.
Jenyns, who once upon a time practised the heal-
ing art in Brisbane, and she we a at least 10 years
of age before her (then widowed) mother made
her first appearance on the boards. In no respect
was this young divinlEy born into the profession,
unless she may be said to have been bom again
after the advent of a histrionic step-papa. Then
did the pinafored maiden to blood and thunder
seriously incline. Essie attended rehearsals,
which fired her juvenile imagination to such a
degree tbat she knew no delight save in hand-to-
hand conflicts with the servant-girl. Many a
time and oft has a small domestic armed herself
with the kitchen shovel, while the embryo star
“laid on Macduff” with the tonga, or put her
back against the cupboard and cried, “ Come one,
come all! ” But Miss Essie was fairly into her teens
before showing any promise of a fine presence, nor
had she the airs and graces of a stage-struck
miss. In point of fact, it is seldom that any lead-
ing lady cometh up like a flower, despite sentl.

The Triumvirate are making a commend-
able experiment at Melbourne Princess’s by (vide
advt.) “ placing the splendour, &o M of their comic
operas and dramas, &0., into an opera of a higher
blass." In selecting “Faust” as a first expert-
ment the management has hit upon a work which
gains little from being rendered in an English
audience’s native tongue, for the reason that it
tells its own story almost equally lucidly in choice
Italian. An opera so thoroughly understanded of
the people cannot be held up by a mere luxuri-
ance of scenery and supernumeraries, nn’ess the
Binging cf the principals is pretty well up to
traditional form, whereas with such as “ Lucia di
Lammermoor,” or “ Aida," an English translation
might go a long way. And in these introductory
remarks lies more honest common-sense than will
appear in a column criticism in any Melbourne
daily. The present production of “ Faust ”
is unique, in so far that the mounting and
accessories are miles in front of the vocalism
and music generally : it is, in point of fact, a gor-
geous leg-show whenever opportunity offers. Of
the company, it may be admitted that they sing
and act their parts well, as far as in them lies,
without ever clearing the great gulf dividing
“ Dorothy ” from grand opera. Comparing them,
for instance, with the late Simonsen Company,
their voices are like pleasing echoes heard from
afar off—faint suggestions of melodious facts
Miss Nellie Stewart was unexpectedly feeble at
the outset on Saturday night, but she stayed well
and poured forth a considerable volume of song in
the last act. Yet at her best--her Improved best
—Miss Nellie made It clear that the nicest of
ducks isn t a swan. Federlci was a depressing
Devil, and Lenmane’a big effort in the garden
scene only served to awaken painful memo-
ries of others much better. Later cn
he finished off his comparatively feeble
notes with Lazzarini’s soulful sob, and became
comic. A flavour of Gilbert and Sullivan hung
about the Martha of Miss Alice Barnett, making
it hard to accept her as anything hut a joke. On
the other hand, Miss Llddiard scored considerably
as Siehel, and Mr, Knight Aston’s Valentine was
“ all very fine and large ”in an acting sense. He
filled his part and sang with a certain plucky air
of being a born baritone instead of an ex-tenor.
A strong orchestra appeared not quite to grasp
the subtle beauties of their job, but the perform-
ance went smoothly enough, especially when the
chorus was about. The Triumvirate have been
“compelled to revise the scale of prices;” they
also “rely on the musical public of Melbourne to
encourage them to give other great works in the
same manner.” We fear no other great work*
will he enquired for just at present, and yet
“ Faust” is an imposing thing in all but the chief

Mr, Federlci, who played Mephistopheles
in “ Faust,” was, as it appears, lying dead in the
green-room of Melbourne Princess’s when onr
notice was written. We forgot to mention that,

slide down to lower regions, and that the descant
was somewhat ineffective on Saturday night, the
seeming hltoh being in poor Federicl’s clutching at
the boards for support as the sliding-trap brought
hia hands to the stage level. That was an expir-
ing effort, for Immediately afterwards he rolled
off the trap Insensible, and was carried into
the green-room to die. The dramatic end

Although Miss Jenyns and 00. did very
fair business with “As You Like It,” the Bijou
bill was changed on Saturday, when the wreath-
ing armed Parthenia conducted Ingomar around
as though she had that unshorn savage on the end
c f a string. Artistically speaking, a play like
“ Ingomar ” is deader than the man who wrote ib,
but Mary Anderson chooses to pose as the Greek
Maiden, so there is no act of Parliament to pre-
vent Essie from showing us exactly how Mary
does it. The young lady accomplishes this feat in
every particular, from the fixing-up of her hair to
the pointing of her left foot, and if “Ingomar”
were chopped up into tableaux vivan fs they would
be quite too sweet for anjthing. As the hero,
Mr. Holloway impressed everybody but the gal-
lery boys, who have little or no soul for what fs
truly great. They laughed -positively laughed I
—when an old Greek identity in a winding-sheet
made personal remarks about Ingomar'a locks and
beard, and the hairy barbarian cried, “ Then cub
them errf!’’ The play was well set up, and,
better still. Miss Essie showed a tendency to
adept the low, sweet voice which is woman's
greatest charm.

Things are beginning to look funereal for
Mr. St, Manr at Melbourne Alexandra. “Brigh-
ten ’’ was tried £ir a week, and on Saturday he
dropped into a romantic drama called “ S:age
Land.” The extreme awfalness cf this work was
intensified by a spurious lag who flapped
her fists to make believe she wai suffer-
ing from extreme old age. It fs sad to see
Mr. St. Maur rowing againsl the tide cf misfor-
tune with a ton of incompetence oa board his
craft. “ Drink ” goes prosperously at the Royal,
and burlesques on that eeven act liquor subject
are given at both the barnt-cork-and-baauty

all Melbourne having paid its money or gone in
with an order to see this monument of colcstal

wings to the garment and wire fixings to flap
them with when wanted. A rather subsequent
correspondent writes to point out than, in The
World Against Her ” at Sjdney Gaiety, Mr. Dam-
pier wore the same snia cf clothes all through,
though three months were understood to
elapse between the acts, and he was sup-
posed to have become a bloated millionaire
in the interval. We can't account for this,
unless the suit was one cf those wear-resist-
ing fabrics which Kurtz used to give his cus-
tomers an allotment of land to take away out cf
the place and be barged to them. Mr. H, B.

the British army, states that one of the swords-
men who jobbed at another fiery warrior for the
billet of champion of the world recently at Bondi,
never drew a sword in his life until 12 moatos
ago. He doesn’t say which it was. The “ Berber,"
a spectacular drama by an abjectly local genius,
was produced last week at Ballarat (Ylc.)
It proved to be a whirlwind of arms and
legs, but no one has yet discovered what
it is supposed to be about. The piece con-
cludes with a sanguinary insurrection of pirates.
It is rumoured that the Bill Holloway combinati n

Negotiations are going on with a view to bringing
Patti out to Australia, It is understood that she

the whole of George-street, Sydney, and Bourke-
street, Melbourne, are made over to her on a

the whole tramway system of Australia and the
gross takings of the season, combined with a free
railway pass and Government billets for all her
relatives. Patti has not gob cancer of the stomach

playing “ Johns Caesar” at New York to an awful
crush, The first night seven basketfuls of squashed
hats, coat-tails, paper collars and ladies’ flxin gs were
gathered up at the conclusion of the show.
Johnny Solomon, go thou and do likewise. An
Infatuated London masher proposed to a nymph
from a leg-show the other night. She borrowed
£lO from him, and then told him that she had
two husbands living already. In the “Shaugh-
ran ” one or the actors examines a wounded nun,
and then draws a pocket-book from his breast and
discovers that it has stopped the bullet. In Dion
Bouoicault’s younger days ib happened that the
other man unthinkingly left the book in his rear
pocket, and, when he had rolled over, Dion ex-
tracted the volume, and then, striking an atti-
tude, started the wonted speech, “A bullet en-
tered here—" he commenced pointing to the
prostrate sufferer’s coat-tails. (Laughter.) Even-
ing dress is going out of fashion in the London
theatre?. Male evening-dress, we mean. The
metropolitan female Is still out low. The Jersey
Lily doesn’t want any rude individuals looking In
at her windows ; she has built six tall fences
round her house in twelve months, and the gates
are fixed with springs so that they are liable to
close on any intruder and jam him up with hia

A small man, who w«s obviously built to
tread rhe paths of pesce rather than to do a
champion slogger and knock-out) his fellow- ,
creatures in 750 rounds, writ) s a tale of bitter woe
to aN Z. paper. He was at home in bed one
night, an unprotected male sfb, high, when
he heard the front door open, ar d a stealthy tread
like that of an elephant a-burgllng resounded on
the stairs. His first impulse was to rise and
clutch the intruder by the ha’r, but he suppressed
this inclination and lay still and perspirad. He
heard the vititor pack up the plate and softly
hump it outside ;.he listened while be removed
the spoons and forks and a silver inkstand, and
while he fell over the sofa and barked his shins;
and then he saw the shadow of a human monster
Oft. 2in. in perpendicular dimensions enter his
bedroom and take his watch, and shake
the coin out of his trousers-pcckets. He saw
all this, and successfully smothered his in-
clination to get oat and fight, and was glad
to find himself still alive when it was all
over. A day or two later he was going along
the stmeS when a great, cool shadow fall upon
him, and looking up, he saw the burglar, whose
gigantic dimensions filled half the firmament. He
watched him and followed close behind, and
when he had trotted about fialf-a mi.e in the
wake of the vast despoiler two policemen hove
in view. “ I say,” whispered the small cit'z.m,
excitedly; “ that’s the man that broke into my
house.” The constables gazad thoughtfully af'er
him as he lurched down the street. “ That him ? ”
queried tbe bigger of the two anxiously, ‘ Yes,
that’s him” “Are ye pretty sure of his Agger,
now?" said the smaller officer meditatively.
“ Yes, it’s him, right enough. Why don’t you,
arrest him ? ’ The two policemen looked at each
other again, and then surveyed the citizen.
“ Well, why didn’t ye hold him till we came ?’’
they demanded together, “ He’s gone now.”
“ Why didn’t I hold him?: 1 said the little man,
with bitter irony. ‘‘D ye think I can hold a horse
by the hind legs ? D’ye think I can clutch an
earthquake and keep it here till you como t,
P’raps you’d like me to collar a gallon of boiling
wator ? Maybe you want me to take a cataract

duty, or something of the kind, and his remon-
strances were smothered in the lookup,

The Rev. Dr. Zachary Barry, of Sydney,

chunk of healing influence because he once stated,
at the Melbourne Temperance Hall, that he hoped
to get a Divine recipe for raising men from the

Dr. Creed still struggles at intervals In

stand why these figures are so hard to obtain.
Perhaps if the doctor were himself a lltt’e more cf
an accountant be would comprehend the case.
The mi itary department never had any accounts.
It has a lot of incoherent memoranda stowed
away in a oandle-b x, but certain of the officials
can’t read their own w/ibing half the time, ar d
are getting bald with try'ng to guess what the
notes are about. Items of Jubilee expenditure
are briefly noted down as “ Bait for the old girl,”
and now they can’t remember whether the old
girl is meant for Her Gracious or nob. “ Inter-
viewing an ancient pants-marine £25 ” is supposed
to be the ot sb of somebody’s journey to Melbourne
to confer with Colonel Sargqol, but the Depart-
ment isn’t sure, and 1 the rest of the accounts are
equally doubtful. When the son of a'gun finds
his cash won’t balance according to the notes on
the fly-leaf of his best girl’s letter he briefly enters
“ Short, 18s. 0*1.,” and the thing is done. This is
the true reason why Creed, M L C., can’t get the
military account’, a~,d unless he se’zss the candle-

Mr. Yarney Parkes, son of Premier

Assembly, ard his bounceable old parent is again
left to represent the family in the ’Ouse all by
Tmself, The rasa is not one of the survival of the
fittest. Mr. Patkes, though a Freetrader, always
voted straight and honestly according to his con-
victions, and the natural result was that he voted
against the old man pretty often. He occasionally
shoved symptoms of brains, and if he had decided
to adhere to politics he might have ultimately
lifted the name of Parkes out cf the mire into
which it has fallen through too much association
with the short and simple annals of the Insolvency
Court; but probably te felt that so long as iha
founder of the race was to the fore it was useless
to attempt to elevate the widely-known cognomen
wh'ch he bore, Mr. Parkes (nee displayed his in-
dependence of spirit by voting for a motion that
the author of his being should be landed out of
Parliament on his ear, and this action alone should
cause the name of the retiring member to be held
in esteem by his suffering country.

Brother the Revd. Madgwiok stated In a
recent yellow oration that “there never was any
blemish on William III.,” from which we gather
teat he knows nothing of the universal blemish
which fell on that asthmatic monarch in Dublin
many years ago. An equestrian statue of the
wheezy foreigner who ran his wife’s father out of
his billet and left him without a cent, faces the
old Parliament House in College Green, aud it
was long the custom of the citizens to repaint sad
gild this image on the night; before the anniver-
sary of the eccimmageattheßoyne—which, by-the-
bye, took place on the Ist July, though Ah Haynea
and his brotherhood mostly fancy it was the 12th.
Somewhere in the far long ago, an ancient watch-
man, who chanced to be panting over his midnight
“ b ate ” discovered a man with a brush and a
bucket fooling around the noble figure and de-
manded to know what divilmenb he was uu to,
sure. “Oh, begorra! it’s givin’ his Majesty a
lovely coat o’ paint f’r to-morrow, I am, an’ won’t
we make them gory papishts ready to cut their
throats with envy in the mamin whin daylolght
breaks," was the prompt reply. “ Kape an oi on
tte bucket a moment, will yez?” and the artist
fled round the corner. The watchman kept his
eye on the bucket for six weary hours, and then
daylight broke and William stood forth in a coat
of tar looking like an escaped fiend from a pano-
rama. And if that wasn’t; a blemish on the
historic Bill we think it is time that Madgwiok
had his mind dug up in order to get a surface on
which to sow some fresh grammar,

Sir Edwin Smith, Mayor of Adelaide,
publicly stated that he had tried to Indues George
Giffen to join the Aua ralßn Eleven; but without
SUOCCfS.
When the rJnr'o imkH, some time agov.
raised an outcry against boxing being allowed in
Sydney, Parkes promised to vitit the saloons and
decide fbr himself whether the affairs should be
allowed to go on or not. Accordingly, one day, a
wh'le back, having set Abigail a page of dictation
to copy out, the great man strolled down to Foley’s
to see what was to be done, and a representative
of this journal, who happened to be there at the
time, gives the following account of what
occurred As the great Hi-Ham marched majes-
tically into Foley’s bar, and demanded to see the
“ pugilistical proprietor," an aged flghting-man.
who was attending to the bar, after gazing bard
at the Pn mien's classic features, gave a yell of
astonishment, ai d-exclaimed, “ Lord bless me, if
it alnt Deaf Burke come back to life !’’ Sir Henry
is said to bear a strong facial resemblance to a
departed pugilist who was famous in the scientific
world under the sobriquet of Deaf Burke. The'
Premier stared, and the old bruiser advanced
holding out the hand of amity. “’O w are yen,
deaf ’unf he jelled at the top of his voice.
“Put it there, if it’s red-hot "—at the same
time offering to shake hands. With an aggrieved*
look the great man drew himself np, and replied,
haughtily, “ You make a mistake. Hi aint deaf,
and my name isn b Burke. Im the Premier."
“ Not Deaf Bur feesaid the old warrior
astonished ; “ I could have sworn to jour nose.
’Owever, I wouldn’t be so flsfh about it; I’ll swear
you ain’t as good a man as Deat Burke anyways.
What’s your name, anyhow?" “Parkes."
“Parkes!” repeated the knocker-out; “never
heard of yon. What’s your line—boxin’, rowin',
three-oard, thlmbleriggin’, foot-racin —though I
shouldn’t take jou for a man with much dash of
foot V" “ I told you, ’ said the statesman, angrily,
“ that lam the Prunler." “ Oh, stow that rot! ”
said the athlete, “ what are ycu premier at—
middle-weights, Orosco Roman, collar-an’-elbow V
Everybody's a Premier, something or other now-
a-dayss The town’s stiff with champions, and
premiers, and nonpareils, and such like." “ I’m-
the Premier of New South Wales,” thundered the
old man, now thoroughly roused. “Oh, only a
local celebrity," said the other, pityingly ; “ I’m
premier middleweight-boxer of the universe my-
self—no Noo South Wales companionship for me ;•
'owever, there’s some boxin’ goin’ on inside, if you
want to have a look, so come alorg—it’s dry work
talkin’, though.” And the boxer went through
the solemn performance of holding np his gnarled'
and dirty forefinger, and making three separate
ineffectual attempts to spit on it : then he
held it np for the Premier’s inspection,
at the same time remarking, “ puffeckly
dry.” This ceremony, which is de rigueur in
scientific circles, is meant to indicate the extreme
thirst of the gentleman going through it, and his-
consequent inordinate desire for liquid refresh-
ment, The Premier, however, did not take the
hint, and the boxer ventured on a further sugges-
tion—“ Wouldn't it bo a good line to blow the
froth off it before we go?” he remarked, and this
time the veteran politician assented, and they
blew the froth off two foaming tankards at the
Premiers expense. “Now," said the png,,
“ come along o' me, and I’ll interjuioe yen to the
boys as Deat Burke ; you lay low.” They moved
on into a room where a lot of the fistic fraternity
were assembled. “ Boys,” said the fighting man,
“ this is my old friend, Deaf Burke—the greatest
man that ever stepped into a ring. When him
and me used to be flghtin’, then flghtin’ was
fightin : no playing pnff-faoe with big gloves and
makin’ a draw for the gate money. Lor’, I seen a
Brummagem chap and a snob from Lunnon ’ave a
set-to in Seven Dials just for love of it, and the
Brummagem man had his left listener chewed off
in the fust routd. -Ah, them was the times!’
The entrance of Foley put an end to these reminis-
cences, and the politician went away with
him, leaving the old man orating to a bored
and incredulous audience about the time
when Tom Sayers diet! —“ and all the profes-
sion went to the funeral, and there was 37
fights in the first two hundred yards, not counting
a scratching set-to between two women.” Our
epresentative followed tie Premier to the boxing
hall, where Foley explained the mysteries cf the
noble art. “ You sze,” he remarked, “the chap-*
facin’ us? Wei!, te holds his docks too high, and*
in ’arf a minute he'll get one in the pantry”—a
favourite expression for the place where one’s
victuals are securely resting. This prediction was-
amply verified, and the boxer was floored**
“ Ought to have looked out for that,” said Foley,
“ He’s all for sloggin’ out, that cove ; if he’d goin
for protection he’d do a deal better.” “Protec-
tion !” snorted the boss of all the freetraders,
“ Do you mean to tell me you believe in protec-
tion? “In course,’ was the reply; “if you don’t
protect yourself you’ll always get more than yon
give, and that don’t pay.” “That’s a fallacy,”
said the other. “It has been said by ingnose■
Wise, and must be true, that imports and exports
always balance each other j it’s an invariable-
rme." “All right.” replied the boxer, “You
come here some night and put on the gloves with
Black Jackson, and see if you don’t Import a great
deal more than you export.” But here the old-
man stalked wrathfully cut, muttering something,
about “ Seedplots of Protectionism," and we may
expect to have all boxing-saloons closed at an •
early date.

That gilt-adged lady “ Mrs. Gordon-
Baillie,” is a-going of it in England. She has en-
snared the susceptible Stead, editor of the Pall
Mall Gazette, who lately gave her two columns
ot an interview, even as he did our own Sir Saul.
The lady is still posing as the Crofters’ fiiend, and
the more that is known of her the more extraor-
dinary it appears. Mrs. Gcrdon-Bail ie is'a proof
of how easily the world can be gulled, especially
by a woman with any pretensions to good looks.
It Is not known for certain whether she ever saw
a Crofter, or was nearer to Skye than her native
town of Edinburgh; yet in Australia she bam-
boozled a greac many worthy people with the idea
that she was a confidential emissary from the
down-trodden associated fisherman of Skye.
“Give ms but land,” said Mrs. Gordon-Baillie,
“ and I will bring them ont en masse”—and she
forthwith promised to people our coasts with a
hardy population, who would provide us with fish
on almost as reasonable terms as she would wish
to have got the land. Lent would no longer be a
time cf real fasting for the poor Roman
Catholics, but of feasting on garfish and on
mullet, on trumpeter, and on bream ; in fact, on
all the most savoury fish cf the Southern seas.
How much, too, would the mental faculties of
yourg Australians be developed by such a diet ?
Mrs. Gordon Balliie burst up in Australia rather
ignominously, having to very quietly go away as
a second-class passenger. With all her cuteness,
and even though she was championed: by the mild
and genial Batters, and though she spent long
hours of close conversation in trying to persuade
him, she could not induce the Victorian Minister
of Land’, Mr. Dow, to grant her one single acre ;
and it was the same in all the other colonies. Yet
the Pall Mall broadly publishes the statement
that Mrs. Gordon-Baillie has, on behalf of tbe
Crofters, 70,000 acres of land In Victoria, and all
she wants now is the money to bring them out,
which, however, she may find rather hard to get,
as tbe career cf this remark ibla lady is becoming
pretty well known, the has shed the rays of her
charms over many pressman ; the man does not
live who could refuse her a par. when she ran him
down in his den. The simpering Phil. RoMrson pat
Mrs. portrait in a societyjcurnal he
wts edliing, but Phil, was always a faithless dog,
and a lady who protrsaed to handle some cf Joe
Clarke’s money seduced him from all his otter
allegiances and caused him to abandon his Aus-
tralian tour. Mrs. G -B. has been very much
married ; she was at one time associated wiuh a
well-known tenor, and claimed to be his wife. A
young man who travelled with her in Australia
as her secretary was, it is alleged, legally married
to her, but nobody in Australia seems to Meow
who Gordon-Baillie was. There was, however, a
worthy sea-captain hight Robinson, to whom
some 15 year* ago the Crofters frier d was married
in Melbourne. This husband sailed away to the
South Seas and Davy Jones's looker. His widow
went to Auckland and opened a boarding-house
and a school there, but soon disappeared to turn
up at the Antipodes, after these long years, as a
great and wealthy philanthropist. When taken
to Ihe N.S.W. Assembly, and while Sir Henry
was treating her to fizz, the other knight,
Sir John, told her pis inly that she was a humbug.
Mrs. Eaillie brought to Australia this trip two
lovely chi:dren whom Sir Henry Loch nursed on
his knee during a concert at Melbourne Town
Hall. Mrs. Gordon-Baillie is almost as mysterious
a personage as Mr. Walter Bezant's “ Herr
Paulus," and, like him, she has had her rise and
her greatness, and her political fall is near at
band, and even though backed up by admiring
pressmen she will shortly disappear once more
into the depths of obscurity from which, by the
aid "of a certain fascinating impudence, she has
managed to push her way.
D<ar Bulletin,—To say'Hat the great
mass of Sydney women sra over-fond of liquor
would be as gross a libel as to say that the great
majority of Sydney married men are gluttons and
wife-bcaters. Still, there was a certain element

Outside the very bull’s-eye of Melbourne
Sassiety there is shocking Indifference on the sub-
ject of “Tummy’s” silver-wedding present, for
the great heart of the people can’t raise a loyal
throb nohow. Enthusiasm began and ended with
that select meeting in the Mayor’s official baok-
parlonr, and the committee then appointed (con-
sisting of “ Lady Clarke and all the other ladies
present ’) meets twice a week in solemn state, to
acknowledge the receipt of two disconsolate
'‘fivers” and a reluctant “quid." As matters
stand at present, about 30 per cent, of the people’s
loving tribute is likely to come from about ten
grovellers with something stuck in front of their
names, a result so shrewdly anticipated that it
was arranged not to publish a detailed subscrip-
tion list ! Tummy is to receive his trophy as
coming from his ma’s faithful subjects in Victoria,
without being given to understand what a
darned few faithful subjects the old lady
has got. The Morning Post and St.
James Gazette will crow over one more
proof of Australian loyalty ; the Times, perchance,
will touch upon the Prince's personal popularity
wherever the English language is spoken, and the
Marquis of Salisbury will tell a Tory meeting how
the colonies dote upon the Royal Family. (Loud
and prolonged cheering.) Thus the miserable
worm of Imperialism crawls its slimy way along
The one satisfactory feature of this silver-wedding
Imposition is in the unexpected ridicule of Mel-
bourne suburban councils - When a local Mayor
rises to mention tha he has received a letter from
Town Cierk Fitzgibbon, respecting a souvenir for
His R ’yal, &o , &c , the council desires him to
take the epistle as read and convert it into pipe
lights. It must bs a very, very rank grovel which
can make any town council sick.

A story comes from Auckland (N.Z.)
about our copper-coloured old friend, Tawhiao,
the Maori king, which Is quite on a par with hie
Intrusion, attired in a nlghvgown and a short clay
»ipe, and carrying a candle, into a London draw-
ing-room full of ladies, to ask for “ a box of
matches.” During a visit paid by him to Auckland
a “ society ” damsel gave a grand al fresco enter-
tainment in his honour. Long tables, piled with
choice eatables, were arranged on the lawn. The
first trouble arose through one of the chiefs in tlie
king’s retinue being supplied with a blue claret-
glass, while those before the king and other chiefs
were red. The punctilious old savage noticed

Tears started from his eyes and trickled dovn his

The fates were against a prominent Hobart
citizen who took his dog for a run one Sunday
morning lately, instead of passing tbe plate round
In chtroh. When returning home, the dog ohal*
lenged another canine specimen on the threshold
of a house occupied by some notorious members
of the demi-monde—not 200 yards from the church
he regularly attended. A fight ensued between
the animals, they yelped, bit, and rolled all over
the footpath, and finally the strange deg darted
through the open door closely followed by bis
antagonist. Then women's shrieks mingled with
howls and yelps, and our hero was implored to
come and separate the combatants. He hastened
to the rescue, after a lengthy application of stick
induced his dog to let go, and walked out of the
house just in time to meet the folks who wor-
shipped in the aforesaid church. ‘ Seeing is
believing, you know.” He attempted to explain
the situation to a few acquaintances, but although
they said little they looked volumes, and he knows
they regard that dog-fight as pure fiction.

A young Sandhurst miner received a
severe shook to his nervous system the other day,
and is now pickling his fists in brine to toughen
them hard enough to pound a man with a thiok
head. The youthful clay-puncher is a Benedict;
he has been ma l rted a few months. He was on
day-sMft last week, and was blissfully delving
after crib, when a trucker handed him a note which
had come from the surface. The missive requested
the young hubby to hie him homewards, as a set of
twins had been added to his possession. The Bened let
did not wait to be presse’d ; he made up the drive
■tfith considerable ecldt, indenting his head against
the cap-pieces and falling over the trucks in his
impetuosity. Once on the surface, he plunged
Into the boiler-house, tied his vest round his neck,
hung his wet trousers in the fire-box, put his
feet into his billy and his crib-bag on his head,
and struck for home at his best pace. By running
down men, women, and children, and perambu-
lators, and turning aside for nothing short of a
jinker, he arrived in time to discover that it was
all a gross lie, and an outrage on the suscepti-
bilities of a young married man. The discovery
was followed by some plain and fancy swearing,
and then the hubby started for the mine again,
swinging a club. The perpetrator of the das-
tard y insult remains in hiding.

That remote and historical dependency of
N.S.W.—Norfolk Island -has now a population of
about 800 souls, all descended from the celebrated
mutineers of the Bounty, and a’most all bearing
their names. Nearly everybody is called Adams cf
Quintal or Christian or Buffet, and Norfolk Island
is almost the only place on the fate of the earth,
barring the Great African Desert, where the
Smiths haven’t got a good hold. The original
mutineers, efter seizing the ship, visited Tahiti*
and bore away a number of dusky maidens whose
habits were t)f primitive simplicity, and the
descendants of these have been manning and in-
termarrying ever since till nearly everybody is
his own grandfather and the relationships can’s
possibly bo sorted out. The bronzed virgins from
Tahiti handed their colour down to their descen-
dants, and many of the lovely girls of Norfolk
Island aren’t quite white by a long way. Al-o
they are very hard-up for husbands. Their an-
cestors had to go round and cadge with violence
for wives with seaweed bustles, and were glad to
take inferior and damaged females at full market
rates, but the scarcity has long since passed away.
The law which prevents strangers set fling on the
island is rough on the young ladies ; it is invari-
ably relaxed, it is true, in the case of a man who
ma ries a Norfolk Island girl, but many a pro-
mising youth who might wrd ono of them if he
were only allowed sufficient time to think, is
bounced out by the remorseless law before he gets
so far. Still, Norfolk Island isn’t half a bad place
for a hard-up British nobleman to go to. When
a girl marbles she gets 12| acres of land, which is
always worth something, and the island grows
the most innocent race of heavy fathers on record.
Many of them at the age cf 40 or 50 have never
once been outside their own little settlement, and
they are just howling for some impecunious swell
to come along and take them in.
Oar old freind, the Duke of Edinburgh,
whose washing-bill has been outstanding over 20
years in Auckland, N.Z M had received from the
British nation, up to the end of 1887, the sum of
£506,883. His present income from the taxpayers
is about £30,000 a year, and he is heir to a similar
amount from the duchy of Saxs-Coburg, while his
wife, the heavy-feeding Russian Grand Duchess,
has a revenue of £ll 250 a year and a private for-
tune of close on £400,000. This impoverished pair
have a free residence at the expense of the hoble
British taxpayer in Kent, and Edinburgh was
accustomed to part about £lO annually, with
much inward anguish, to the local hospital. Oa
his appointment, however, as figurehead of the
Mediterranean fleet with a huge salary, he wrote
to the trustees, pointing oat that, as he no longer
resided In the county, they couldn’t reasonably
expect him to subscribe any longer, and that
astounded body proceeded to take Edinburgh’s
bull-dog cognomen off the list. The Duke still
collect! his annuity from the nation, though he no
longer resides in the country, but then Edinburgh
out collecting is a vary different thing from some
one else out trying to collect from Edinburgh.
People who have made the attempt will be pre-
pared to take an affidavit on this before any re-
spectable justice of the peace or commissioner for

felt called upon to upend himself and rebuke them
for their disloyalty. There Is just a possibility of
a Mayor getting a C.M G.-ship, but a councillor,
never. The latest refusal to contribute to the

Well, not exactly, Christian Israelite. If Jews do
live longer than Gentiles it is because, as a rule,
they don’t do hard work themselves but wax fat
on the tollers. Also, because they seldom put
their strong intellects to any greater strain than
is involved in the getting of Interest or the
trading off of shares at an advance. And, finally,
because a large proportion of Jews have two rest-
day?, or pleasure days, every blessed week, and
never devote them to drunkenness. If the sons

One bright, calm evening last week, the
sort of evening when the thoughts of the muni-
cipal taxpayer seem to be irresistibly drawn to
the contemplation cf loftier things, three ladies
were progressing along College-street, Sydney, on
their way to batch a melancholy omnibus. Tvo
of them were young and pretty; the third was
dubious, like a “ faked-up ” Jubilee coin or a politic
clan's cheque, and, in the ordinary c rarf eof things,
this S 8 year old piece of damaged goods was shoved
to the front by the other two when a nasty, means
horrid male thing came sidling up to the party.
‘' May I see you a little dls tar ce along the street,
my dears ? ” said this individual in insinuating
tones, trying as he spoke to got a peep under the
veil of the gorgon in the van, whereupon the lady
laddressed waved a large umbrella and replied in
a cracked bass voice: “ Base, low, mercenary
wretch, how detre you address ladles in the
street?" The remark fell with a shock on the
unhappy citizen. He had taken her for five-and -
twenty. But he pulled himself together and
bowed with a sweeping gesture. “I beg your
pardon, madam," he said, humbly ; “ the fact is
that I am waiting for my—aw—mother and my
two unmarried—ahem—sisters, and in the uncer-
tain light I mistook you for them. I owe you an
apology, Ido indeed." The procession came to a
full stop in the effort to smother its wrath,
and the lady in the van took stock of
the stranger. Ha was 43 if he was a day ; his
teeth were false ; his hair was dyed purple, and
Ms mother, if he had one, must have been aged
78, and must have looked 20 years older at the
least from sheer misery at being related to such a
spectre. Strong language, she felt, would be
thrown away on such a walking ruin, and she
dropped into cordiality instead. “ Young man,"
the said, in honeyed accsnts, “persevere as you
lave begun and you will prosper. Always meet
your mother and sisters in the street. It is a rare
mark of virtue when a youth pays such courteous
attention to his female relatives ; also meet your
maiden aunt at every possible opportunity, and I
have no doubt that I will one day sea you in a
very elevated position. Meet your grandmother
hleo as often as you can. Good-bye, young man,
gcoi-bye," and with that the trio went thought-
fully on their journey, leaving a badly broken-up
dude leaning against a lamp post and looking sad
end very sick. It was the first time he had been
received that way, and he didn’t know what to do
about it.
Lord Cabington, as the official representatite of
the fount of mercy, and as assistant Pre-eminent
in Grief, has been graciously pleased to commute
the death-sentence passed on a poor wretch named
Jt ellas Watson' to imprisonment for life, the
first three years in irons. There is something
beautifully English and logical about this system
of piling wanton torture on a convict who is con-
signed to a living grave, and Lord Carington
might think the matter over —if he has anything
to think with— and see if he can’t fix up something
in the way of mutilation as well to make the ar-
rangement complete.
A POEM FOUNDED ON FACT,
There is a young man in Kew,
Who on Sundays has nothing to do ;
He wouldn’t for fish go a bobbing,
He wouldn’t In bars be hobnobbing ;
Much more fun he thought it than dricking
At the girls in the choir to be winking.
He’d a voice that was something sublime,
And he sang in the choir all the time,
Till one day he committed a scandal
That you wouldn’t believe of a Vandal.
It was hot, but the choir stool in wonder
When that young man he struck a note under ;
But he took off his coat
To ascend that top note,
And he sang in his shirt-sleeves , by thunder I
Thera is still a young man in Kew,
Who on Sundays has nothing to do ;
So you’ll see him for fish go a-taobbing,
And in bars like a fiend be hobnobbing,
For he now thinks it more fun to be drinking
Than at callow choir-girls to be winking.
The cause of this was—when the coat-tale was
stated,
The young man was promptly excommunicated.
The moral is—never mind how you perspire.
Don't take off your coat when you sing in the
choir.
The Member for Mud.
(A. BALLAD OF “FREETRADE")
In the Fourth rate Estate sure he started along
As a friend of the right and a foe of the wrong ;
He cared not a straw for the rich or the great,
All who pandered to fraud he proceeded to slate.
He worked like a Trojan to fossick out crime,
Anddenounoeditinlanguageprofuse and sublime •
A spade he called spade, and a spud he called spud,
Till he started in life as the member for Mu!.
His diction was worthy a Billingsgate fag,
Mixed with eloquence cadged from the primitive
lag;
Though a Freetrader straight yet he slated poor
Parkes,
And sketched Jaynlal Dan playing all sorts of
larks,
While he spread himself out to upend his owld
church,
Till his organ piped small and got left in the
lurch ;
Then he grew under Parkes a political bud,
And by eating his words became member for Mud
Next he trotted out figures and wrote to the press
That Protection was clothed In Papistical dress,
And that, all things considered, “ To Hell with the
Pope ”
Was hla suffering country’s last refuge and hope ;
And he hied him away with a red gory shirt
And spouted around till it trailed in the dirt ;
And his Billingsgate rolled like a sewer in flood
Till the Chinese brigade made him mem v er for
Mud.
Now the member for Mud. is a promising lad ;
Though he hangs on to “ Sirs ” still he says he’s a
Rad.
He Is ready to lie very low for his Queen,
And trample the Blue In the dust like the Green ;
But on one solid point he’s a Rad , I'm afraid,
For he’ll vote like a brick that the members be
paid—
This, at least, Is an instance that he has done good,
For that Act will extinguish the member for Mud.

GERMS CAUSE FEVERS.
The germ theory of disease has received farther
support from the researches which a scientist of
the United States has instituted into the ciuses of
the terrible mortality recently prevailing among
fresh water flah in some parts of the American
Continent. The mortality among the perch and
other fish of Lake Meadota, Wisconsin particularly,
had been extraordinary, the fish dying off in
enormous numbers. Prt fessor Forbes, of the Illi-
nois Sta’o College, has reported that diseases due
to the minute spherical microbe or germ, whose
diameter is only about the 1-25 000th part cf an
inch. This germ he discovered in the liver and
the kidneys of the diseased fiih. There it forms
abscesses which ultlm a* ely destroy the cells of those
organs, and therewith the life cf the fi?h Pro-
fessor Forbes says that there are various species
of this germ, and that they attack human beings.
The different varieties cause specific diseases, such
as fevers, small pox chicken-pox, hog cholera, and
so forth. It Is a well-known factthat in aninfected
locality only a portion of the inhabitants are
ed with, say, typhoid fever. And the answer as to
why this Is so, and which Is reasonable is,
that the resisting, or antipathetic power in some
constitutions is greater than in others. What is
this pow'er 1 It is simply nerve force. And for
just this reason it behoves ever/ man and woman
to keep his or her system in the best possible con-
dition to resist disease, and no tetter plan can
be employed than to take Warner’s safe cure and
safe pills to keep the nerves of the system in sound
order, and able at all times to perform the work
put upon them. The deaths from typhoid fever
in the colonies is something alarming. It has often
been called, and very appropriately, “>c denial
fever. ” Much of it however, can be avoided
Cesspits ought to be abolished:; water and milk
should always be boiled during typhoid infection
to kill the germs; perfect cleanliness of the person
must not be neglected:; isolation of typhoid pa Tents
should be Insisted on ; all excreta should be burned.
The important featnre, however, is tr keep the
system in such rude health that it will neutralize
the evil effects of such germs as may be breathed
into the lungs or taken into the stomach through
liquids, and thus escape disease and death. We
have pointed out how to attain this result, and
hundreds of instances prove our theory sound.
Were I on suicide intent
With pistol at my head,
Or o'er the foaming torrent bent,
To leap into its bed,
E’en then I could be resqjjed by
Some friend upon the brink,
Who’d whisper In my ear the cry,
“ What will you take to drink?"
“ Sfi. Louis Lager Beer," I'd yell,
In accents wild and clear,
There’s nanght can soothe
Parched bowels like
“ St. Louis Lager Beer." *

BUSH SO[?]GS.
Ed. Bulletin, —A back number of The
Bulletin contain! a very interesting contribution
on tbe above subject in which the writer quote 3
an excellent sample of the peculiar lyricj beloved
of the bushman. Perhaps in time to come it may
fall to the lot of soma one to collect the “ sabre-
cuts of Saxon speech ” which, bearing the stamp
of originality, have had their beginning by the
camp-fire and in the hut away in the remote out-
posts of settlement known as the “ back-blocks.’
During the writer’s early experience of these re-
gions—over 20 years baek —when the papulation
wai made up of a very mixed and widely-
divergent agglomeration of humanity; whan
th 3 ‘old-hand’ element —just beginning
to die out—was leavened with the admix-
ture of new chunho'jd and growing bush-
natives, the popular songs covered a wide
range of subjects, from the “homely pathetic ’ or
concert-hall melody, to the “ O.d Bullock Dray,”
the “Broken-mouthed Saepherd, ’ or the effusion
—generally with a rattling chorus -of some bush
poet. Among the latter the localised parody ol
some popular song—with plentiful personal allu-
sions—generally gained a wide popularity. In the
station-hut, during shearing time, at the horse
or bullock-driver’s camp, or cut on the ran when
stockmen gathered by the fire, within ken of the
bellowing herd, the song,jeff, or tala—not always
cleanly, but none the less enjoyable—was heard
at Its best. The “Stockman's Grave "—which
I first heard at a shoap-washer's camp In 1865
—was a great favourite. Who knows but that
its pathetic forca may have given Lind-
say Gordon the key-note for his “ Sick Stock-
rider?” A roughly-written copy of this lyric
(whlcn I picked up at an abandoned camp) wns
signed “ Lmfch Hay,” but whether that la the
author’s name or not is open to argument. Eliza
Cook’s “Sailor's Grave” was in great vogue about
this time. Numerous versions of “Old Grimes,”
localised, and “ John Browns Body” were also in
high esteem. Tne Gallic element was noticeable
in such obscure off ishm as “ Tha Grand Conver-
sation on Napoleon arose,” and I have heard a
Tipperary man with fiery gesture and strident
voice bring do vn the hut with what appeared to
be a rhymed itinerary in which the most anti-
Saxon sentiments were expressed, and the
doiegs of a certain “ Gallant Mioharl Hayes”
were greatly eulogised. The following is leavened
with the prevailing bash etiiies, wh’ch perhaps
jet survive in certain quarters :
“ And we'll saddle up our horses and away,
For we 11 duff the equattcr’a cattle in the dark-
ness of the night,
And we ll brand ’em in the dawning of the day.”
At tha “Crossing” public house, or shanty, where
teamsters “ most did congregate,” I have heard
an improvisatorial “bnllooky” win great applause
with an al freso version, cf which I caught this
Ecrap :
“0 my boys! bullock-driving’s very funny
Until you break two bullocks’ necks
And get stuck in a gully,
And then you know—you’re bound to go,” &c.
This gentleman varied his vocal efforts with a
fanta ie on the penny-whistle and a violent 1-tap-
dance which so captivated his fellow wieldars of
the long green olds tnat an impending fight sud-
denly collapsed and the debt of henour was frater
naily liqti laced at the bar. At the station-hut,
find during shearing time where a very represen-
tative gathering of bushmen was to be found, the
nasal quaver of the “ old hand ’ might be heard
as ho vaunted the glories of some old-tlma bush-
rangfr
“ Who was hunted up and down, my boys,
Lika an old-man kangaroo,
But Hi fight ’em tea to oae, says he,
Says Bald Jack Donohue."
Or, perhaps, as he gave a doggerel reminiscence
of th 3 ill-famed island-pdeoa denounced in
“ Frank, the Poet’s/’ scathing valediotl m as
“ Squatters’ home and prisoners' hell,
Land of Sodom,-fare thee wel',”
where
“ They yoked up like horaeo,
All in Van Dieman’s Land.”
Runaway sailors formed a strong item of the bush
population in thorn days, and, as a consequence,
nautical songs (the original article), redolent of
the forecastle—the very antithesis of Dlbdin’s
stagey produc ions—were frequently heard, The
“old shell” soon assimilated the ways of bush
life, and many a time has the hut rung in spon-
taneous chorus as he told —need'essly—how
“ The song was composed when the watch went
below,
Bound away in the ‘ Dreadnought ’ to the West
world we'll go,”
Or, as with many and emphatic thumpings, he—
modestly—sang :
“lama hero stout and bold,
I’ve a long time ploughed the ocean ;
I’ve ploughed is over and over again
For honour and promotion.
'Tis many is the battle that I have been In
Aboaid a man o'-war and a merchant again,
a nd all the harm that ever I done V
Was the c mrting of the giria both old and
youog."
In those days, when the colonies were inundated
by yourg men of liberal education and of what Is
called good families, probably a higher average of
intelligence obtained than is to be found among
the bush population no v a-days. The “ Jacka
roo ” or, to use a euphemism, the “ Cadet,” was
to be found on most stations—generally samples
of the “ne'er-do-well’’ class, who were expa-
triated by relatives in the vain hope that self-re-
liance would be a result of the rough experiences
of colonial life. Many of these, subsidised
to remain abroad, were brainless young vil-
lains who drew their remittance with a re-
gularity that was only equalled by the celerity
with which it was dissipated at the nearest
shanty. A few knuckled down to the reali-
ties of altered existence and gradually sunk
their early associations amid the “ rank-and-
file” in which they had become absorbed. A
young fellow of this latter class' was sheep-droving
with the writer away In the “New Country”
north of the alligator-line, during the early
Sixties. Having brought discredit upon the judi-
cial wig of his father (a Scotch law lord) he found
himself a remittance-man in the back-blooks at
the time of which I write. A truculent-looking
young scamp with the head of a prize-fighter,
who was respected by reason of his “scien-
tific” attainments, which, however, he seldom
exhibited. He was the soul of the camp,
and a champion drinklng-man. At the
first station on which he was employed
the bent of his genius took the direction of satiri-
cal parody, levelled at the station super, who, by
the way, was nicknamed “The Duke.” Here is a
specimen of lyrical melange—as it occurs to me —
which I have heard him voice to an appreciative
and sympathetic audience of drovers, washers
shearers and “ knockabouts ” on the “ burst" —a
a wayside “hotel”:—
“I’ll sing to you a rough old song made by the
Lord knows who,
Or very likely by the last bran-new-chum Jackaroo.
To think that he could find himself no better thing
to do,
Than make songs cn his super—and on such a
super too—
As this fine Australian Nobleman all of the
present lime
“At his slab and greanhida mansion he sits with
ease so grand.
In gravest consultation with his official band.
There's Bill, the under-super, and N 's the raw
new-hand.
And Mick, a limestone nigger-boy—a native of
the land,
This fine, old Australian Nobleman all of the
present time.
About where he's going to lamb-do wn he argues
very deep,
And how he’ll pull the shepherds for a-losing of
their sheep,
And haw he rode a hundred miles in thirteen
hours or lass ;
And on his return the station was in a (sanguin-
ary) mess.
This fl ;e Australian N obleman all of the pres ent
time."
“ Then success to aristocracy,
And down with d—democracy,
Tha noblemen out here, I see,
Are few and far bstwean.
So we ll drink to the one we’ve got, my boys,
With a full and flowing pot, my boys,
For he’s a clever fellow,
And that’s easy to be seen.
No trace of the “Senior Wrangler” or classical
tripos in the above, so thorough l y did Lord N ’a
—as he was familiarly known - possess the faculty
of adaptation, I have porposely withheld his

tha assaults of a thousand sprees, and I am not
The Bulletin’s fighting-editor. Here is the tala
of his own earlier colonial experiences, as the
memory of many “harmonious’’ nights spent in
hts company supplies it
There is no mistaking the truth of this rude picture,
which doubtless was the secret of its popularity
in the sphere to which its author had been rele-
gated by the iron hand of circumstances. Some
years later, during a trip “down South,” I heard
the familiar chorus, “ Im a Jackaroo,” awake the
Island echoas from the fore-cabin as the old
Boomerang made her wny through the Whit-
sunday passage by calm moonlight. And perhaps
its grip still holds even wh ere the genua Jackaroo
has become obsolete in the) big baby colony of the
North where the Iron-horsa has well nigh extin-
gulshed the good old creed expressed In the
“Bullooky’s ” parodied refrain—
“ There’s nob a traveller comes my way
Bat always gets a feed,
While I drive old Yellowman In the pole
And Bailey in the lead.”
“GAMBASH[?].”
There are signs that the same “ religions
influences which acted under the Freetrade flag
at the last N.S.W. election are coming into fcroi
at the next general struggle In Queensland. The
Premier’s father holds high office in the brother
hood, and parson Woolaough is ready to howl to
the full extent of his £BOO a-year. Thank heaven
the working men of Brisbane don't care one s'ngh
straw for the lot.
Messrs. M‘Giegor, Harris, and Co., oi
Sidney, have presented a splendid silver cup,
valued at 500 guineas, to be shot for in a series ol
annual rifle competitions extending over 12 years.
The contests will be open to all nations, bat must
take place on Australian soil. The cup. which is,
perhaps, the most valuable trophy ever given
away as a shooting-prize, la a magnificent
work of art, and is about Ht. high. Among
the figures engraved upon it Is a striking image of
Parkes in a former state of existence, before he
‘ jumped up wni e pfelJer." He has very little

Writes a correspondent:—“ Melbourne
society was agitated to its inner singlet last week
by the marriage of a certain Dr Hooper to the
Governor’s governess. The doctor is Scotch, and
28, more or less. Mrs Hooper is Swiss, and old
enough to know salt from celery. Three years
ago Dr. Hooper, who is, no doubt, an able man,
held a small appointment; now he occu-
pies a house in Collins-street at a rental
of a good many hundreds a year. The
wedding was one of the biggest advertise-
ments a medical man ever had on earth. The
Grand Duke Michaelovitoh was there, and gave
the bride a diamond horse-shoe brooch. All the
members of the “ push ” were there, and the
wedding presents, if mortgaged, would keep the
happy couple going for two or three years. But a
great many other people, not ia the “ push,” were
asked to the wedding and breakfast, Bohemian
members of the Yorick Club seemed strangely out
of place among the snobs and snobesses of Toorak,
Many lady patronesses of charities were also con-
spicuous in the church. These were asked, it ia
whispered, in ordsr to secure influence and favour
for Dr. Hooper s election as one of the msdical
officers for the Woman’s Hospital. De vr Lady
Lorh was pushing the master amongst her circle,
and after the wedding many ladies sbsr ed
actively canvassing on his behalf.

“THE ‘JACKAROO.’
“ Whan I arrived in Brisbane I thonght to cut a
dash,
Bat I was very soon pulled up by the shortness
of my cash ;
I mat a Northern squatter who slid that he'd
take me
For forty pounds per annum a Jackaroo to be —
I’m a Jackaroo, just coma from tha old coun-
trea,
The squattars here they need not fear that
tbay can humbug me,
When I got to tha station I saw the super there,
‘Hallo !’he says, ‘my Johnny Raw, what the
d 1 brings you here ?’
And then I draws mys elf right up, as straight
as I could ba,
‘ I’m here,’ I says, *to do twelvemonths', a
Jackaroo to be,’
For I'm a Jackaroo just out from the old
countree,
The squatters here they need not fear that
they can humbug me.
“ O, first he sent me driving a nasty, jibbing
mare,
He told me that she’d pull the dray without
any trouble or care.
But she stuck me up on the road, and I began
to holler,
When up the super oomss—and calls me a blank
b ank crawler,
And a jumped up Jackaroo just out from the
old countrae.
The squatters here, I’m free to swear, have
got the loan of me.
“ O, next he sent me shepherding a fighting flock
of rams,
And next I went a lambing-down to fetch home
the green lambs ;
Bat I couldn’t find ’em green—for lambs are
mostly white.
And sure enough I lost myself away in the bush
all night.
Such a stupid Jackaroo just come from the
old countree,
The squatters here, I greatly fear, have got the
loan of me.
“0, next I went off siding with a beastlybullook-
dray.
And next he sent me riding with rations all the
day,
And then he sent me cleaning out a dirty lamb-
ing yard,
A rouseabout from this to [that my case was
very hard.
A luckless Jaokarco, just come from the old
countree,
The squatters here, I greatly fear, will be the
death of me.
"Now, all day while I’m shepherding and taking
of the sun,
I sigh and wish within myself that this ere
lambing was done ;
For the flour id is bad and the tea is bad as
well,
And I wish that Northern squatters and their
stations wore all In h 1,
That’s the hope of a Jackaroo just come from
the old countree,
The squatters here, I sadly fear, will see tha
last of me,
“ Now, all arriving new-chums, take warning
here by me.
Never go to a Northern squatter bush experience
to see,
For they will use you strangely and treat you
most damnably;
You’ll scarcely live a six-months ; if you do,
then beggar me!
The advice of a Jackaroo—not long from the
old countree —
The squatters here, ’tls very clear, have had
the loan of me.”

receipt of instructions for country buyers who can-
not attend the sale at the lowest rates.
THE land is the best ever yet submitted by
subdivision around Melbourne, and it is
admittedly the acme and perfection of the most
fashionable, the healthiest, the most charming,
and the most romantic spot of Toorak, which, it
is needless to say, stands without a rival amongst
the suburbs of Melbourne. The Estate, which is
surrounded by Mansions, has a beautifully pano-
ramic view. For accessibility to the City the
Estate excels all other fashionable residential sites.
By road it is about miles from the Post-office;
by rail it is considerably less. The Glen Iris Rail-
way branches off from Burnley, and after travel-
ling one mile and three-quarters reaches the Rail-
way Station to be erected on Mr. Ferguson’s pro-
perty at the Glenferrie-road. This St ation is two
minutes’ walk from the GREAT TOORAK
ESTATE. By rail the City will be reached from
your breakfast-table comfortably in fifteen
minutes. The Toorak Tram, now in course of
construction, will take you from the heart of the
City to within eight minutes’ walk of the Estate
for Threepence, and the omnibuses from the Tram
Terminus to Malvern pass the Estate. Gas and
water laid on. Drags and Conveyances will meet
Intending purchasers at South Yarra Station.

A Special Invitation.
We especially invite a trial by all chose sufferers
from Kidney and Liver complaints who have
failed to obtain relief from other remedies and
from doctors. Nature’s great remedy— dr bell's
bitters- has effected cures in many obstinate
cists. It acts at once on the kidneys, liver and
bowe's, cleansing the system of all poi-onous
humors, and restoring a healthy condition of those
important organs. Do not be discouraged, but
try it.
Gloomy forebodings, Sleeplessness, Violent Headaches,
Nervous Irritability, and Heart Palpitation all arise from a
disordered Liver, and natures own remedy is secured in
Dunstone’s Compound Essence op Dandelion and
Livek Pills. Instant relief, and speedy and permanent
cure. Pleasing to the taste. Is also a certain remedy for
Gout, Rheumatism, Sciatica, and Lumb »eo. Wrapped with
each bott'e are copies of testimonials which will convince the
most sceptical. llunstone’s C mpound Essence of Dande-

William’s Australian Insecticide is death to all Insects.
Simple in application—sure In effect. This is the only genuine
Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to all kinds
of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal life, and
therefore may be used without the slightest apprehension.
For the extermination of Mosquitos especially, the Insecti-
cide has no equal—as the fumes of the burnt powder, while
throwing off a pleasant odour, ate at the same time most
destructive to them. Sold in Is. boxes by all chemists and
storekeepers. Manufactured only by W. Williams,
Pharmaceutical Chemist, 257 King-street, Newtown. Whole-
sale from Mess's Elliott Bros, and E. Prosser & Go.*
A Lovely and Delicate Complexion.— This is ob-
tained by using Rowlands’ Kalydok., an emollient and
harmless milk for the face, hands, ard arms; it removes sun-
ourn, tan, freckles redness and roughness of the skin,
cutaneous eruptions, &c., and produces soft, fair, and deli-
cate skin. Avoid metallic and greasy cosmetics, which ruin
the skin. Rowland s Odonto, a non-grittv tooth-powder,
whitens the teeth. Ask chemists for Rowlands’ articles.
“ DON’T KNOW HALF THEIR VALUE.”
“ They cured me t f Ague, Biliousness and Kidney Com-
plaint, as recommended. I had a half bottle left which I
used for my two little girls, who the doctors and neighbor
said could not be cured. I would have lost both of them om
night if I had not. ! iven them Dr. Soule’s American Hop
Bitters. They did them so much good I continued their use
until they were cured. That is why I say you do not know
half the value of Dr. Soule’s American Hop Bitters, and do
not recommend them high enough.” 8., Rochester, N.Y
Sea other column.—American Rural Home.
" Deacon Wilder, I want you to tell me how you kept your
self and family well the past season, when all the rest of us
have been sick much, and have had the doctors visiting us so
often; 1 ’
‘Bro. Taylor, the answer is very easy. I used Dr. Soule’s
American Hop bitters in time; kept my family well and
saved the doctor's bills. Three dollars’worth of it kept us
well and able to work all the time. 111 warrant it has cos ;
you and the neighbors one or two hundred dollars apiece to
keep sick the same time.’ ‘ Deacon, 111 use your medicine
hereafter.’
A Boon to Humanity. —ln 1844 a therapeutical inven-
tion v as brought before the world, which surprised everyone,
in that it dispelled, modified or lessened Pain, the charac-
teristic symptom of nearly all diseases. The inventor made
no secret of h'S l iscovery, although at the time Scepticism
raised her head, and people loudly acclaimed it was im-
possible that a tingle medicine Cjuid arrest Pain of every
kind, and care a variety of diseases t uch, however, was the
fact when Mr. Richard Freeman placed la the hand of the
public his Genuine Chb rodyne. Year by year its cosmo-
politan popularity has increased, till it is now found in every
quarter of the globe and thousands daily, in New Zealand
and other lands, express their gratitude and sens» of security
from the use of this iredicine.—Sold everywhere throughout

A Popu ar Fallacy.
Many people think that rheumatism cannot be
cured. It is caused by a bad state cf the blood,
which deposits poisonous matter in the joints and
mut dee, causing lameness st ffness and swelling
of the joints, and excruciating pains, dk. bell’s
(Kidney and Liver) bitters will certainly effect a
cure. They act on the kidneys, liver and bowels,
stimulating them to a healthy action, purifying
and enriching the b’o id and eliminating the poison
from the system. Go to the nearest druggist, buy
dr bell s bitters and be cured.

Gentlemen,—l have great pleasure In recom*

suffering for several years with liver complaint,

curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different

all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them,—

medicines of different kinds for affections of the

depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION

From a recently-published African book
of travels“ The Egyptian conjurers know how
to render this serpent (the cobra) stiff and immov-
»ble by pressing the nape of the neck with the
finger, and thro wing it into a sort of catalepsy.
The serpent is thus apparently converted into a
rod or a stick." This throws a good deal of light
on the story of Aaron and the magicians.
This interesting scene took place the other
mornicg, A man, who looked like a labonrer,
was coming somewhat unsteadily down the street
with his poor little wife after him, trying to per-
suade him to go home At last his patience gave
way at being followed, and he balanced himself
wiih an effort, and said, “You needn’t be
thrapesin’ aftur me loike this, now. I tell ye I’m
not goin’home. Is that enough for ye z?" “Well,

Dr. Neild, of Melbourne, the other day
extracted from the liver of a lunatic named

and a German-silver fork with contorted prongs.
The doctor says he never heard of such a queer
esse since the sponges were sewn up in a live
woman’s body at the Alfred Hospital.
A miner from Broken Hill, fired with its
wondrous promise, thought he detected in a South
Australian capitalist's property the signs of a rich
deposit of ore. He asked the rich man’s permis-

condi ion that he received one fifth of the grots
proceeds “I’ll think about it," sail Croesnp,
“an’ I’ll see mo wife." Next day he saw the
miner again and said, “I ’ave talked over your
offer, and me and me wife both think one-fifth is
too much to give you; but make it one-fourth and
you can work away." That miner skipped prayer-
fully to a lawyer to get the agreement down i
b'ack and white, and at latest advices was gee

Few people are aware of the alarming prevalence
of Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among
those who have arrived at or past middle age. It
is declared on good authority that fully one-half
the deaths in this country are either directly or
indirectly the result of Kidney cr Liver disease of
some sort.
A great majority of men above 10 years of age
are afflicted with some sort of affection of the
Kidneys or Bladder; and these diseases are on the
increase. Persons are often seriously affected
before they know of it themselves, and thus these
insidious disorders get a good foothold before any-
thing is done to dislodge them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s disease, In-
continence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder,
Albumenuria, &c., are among the many forms of
these diseases. Most of these are very difficult to
cure, defying the powers oftentimes of the best
physicians obtainable, and are pronounced by
many to be incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in
diseases of this form oftentimes there are no
symptoms of a marked nature. This is one of the
reasons why they are so difficult to cure.
Dr. Bell’s Kidney and Liver Bitters is a specific
for Kidney and Liver troubles. Bladder and
Urinary diseases. Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and
all of that class of disorders.
It cures Biliousness, Headaches, Jaundice, Liver and
Stomach troubles, D.spersia, Constipation, and Piles
It cures Intemperance, Nervous diseases, General Debility,
Female Weaknesses and excesses.
It is thoroughly reliable, hiahly recommended, works
promplly, relieves at once, and vat never known to fail.
TESTIMONIALS.
Gents.—I have been troubled with Kidney disease; there
was also fluttering of the heart—palpitation, I suppose—
and I had to lie v. ry quiet after going to bed At last I
thought I would try a bottle of your bell s bitters I
purchased some at Bedford, and took the medicine as
directed, and after using one bottle, I felt no more of the
fluttering heart I got another bottle, and had to take only
one-half of It to be cured. My daughter was similarly
troubled; had no appetite ; could not sleep at night. I gave
her my half remaining bottle, and she rests as well as ever.
There is no trouble with my kidneys now. I shall keep
your medicine on hand
October, 1886. William Bitter.
Gentlemen—I have been troubled ever since I was a child
with Headaches of a nervous character, and my mouth was
full of canker sores—so bad, Indeed, that I could not eat;
nor could I rest at night. At last I tried your bell’s
bit , bus, and two bottles have brought me out all light, and
I now feel like a new person.

They have a habit in the Melbourne
morgue of keeping a body several days, with a
view to its identification, before they dispose of it
finally. This may be a necessary custom bat it
Is not a very cheerful one. Frequently the body
is never identified. Few people are to claim ac-
quaintance with a corpse. Its name is no good
on a bill, it has no tobacco to lend, as a rule, and
is unable to set-up a drink. One has to be dead
awhile to obtain a real idea of his place in the
scheme cf creation.
Aaron Waxman’s friends have been pub-

tion hold good, Marcus Is heaping coals of fire on
the head of Aaron by lending him money, or what-
ever is the equivalent thereof in the next stage of
existence, without charging him interest. This
would be a fine epicurean kind of revenge which
Clarke would relish tremendously.

taxed to the extent of £7,000,000 a year. In
other words, the structures which re prerent

heavily as the land, which was stolen from the

The Referee.
Hop. James White fairly swept the board on
the first day of the V R.C. meeting. He won the
Eisendon Stakes with Carlyon; the Ascot Vale
Sakes with Volley; the Sc. Leger with Aber-
corn ; and appropriated the much-coveted New-
market Handicap with Cra* 1 brook, this being the
first time he has carried off a Newmarket. Tom
Hales bad the mount in each event. Joa 7 homp-
sm laid Mr. Whit®, just before the raofi g com-
menced, £lOOO to £1 that Mr. White would not
secure the four events. Toe last race on the card,
the Brunswick Stakes, was won by Mr. D, S,

Foley’s Hall was packed on Saturday
night, at os. and half-a-sov. a head, the event
being the meeting of Murkan man Costello and
the amateur champion-boxer, Mr. George Seale,
in a six-rounds encounter, Costello undert iking
to knock the amateur to a standstill. Costello
towered, b r g and lusty, over his opponent, but as
well might he have tried to knock out a streak of
lightning. For the first two rounds nothing
desperate was attempted, but in the third Costello
showed he meant business, launching out right
and left most viciously. But he soon got tired of
rushing tactics, as the amateur was n.ver where
the American expected him to be when he
let out, and, overreaching, he left himself open
to heavy returr s from Mr. Seale. In the
fourth round Cos ello altered his style to right
hand in front, but ttuee heavy visitations in quick
succession showed the mistake he made, and he
at once went back to his natural style. From
this out to the finish the little one made play and
fairly nor plusaed the Yank with the rapidity of
his hitting and getting away. The amateur boxed
in something like his old style, and the perform-
ance was one of the best he has yet shown, for, eo
far from being “ knot ked out,” the nimble and
tricky Costello did not get home a single b’ow
worthy the name from first to last. We shonld
much like to see the amateur, in tip top oondidon,
box four or six rounds with Jack Burke. The
show would be worth going a long way to see, and
we charge nothing for tbe suggestion.

An ancient identity cropped up amongst
the black cricketers in thepermn of our old faend
Twopenny. Twopenny may be called one of the
pioneers of Australian cricket in England, he
having f rated one cf Charley Laurence’s team cf
aboiigines Twcp nny, in his day, could give
poor Tommy Wills and Dave Gregory a start at
shying at a wicket, but the cld-un must have lost
his cunning, as Nat Thompson did not think him
good enough for a place. Twopenny showed
marked signs of civilisation after his return f om
the old country, and could give many a Civil
servant a start in borrowing bobs just “till the
first." Twopenny was thought so much of In
Sydney that ho represented the colony in an In-
tercolonial about’72, Sydney taking him over to
floor the Vies, So fast could he shy that it was
thought necessary to take ovrr a special longstop
(shades of Blackham !) to stop him, the person
chosen being poor C »rvle Da Meit:e Thompson,
who was afterwards accidently shot whilst mat ing
holiday over Port Hacking way. Twcpsnny didn’t
“oomaoff, ’ however, the Vies “doing the corn-
stalks bad ”in one innings. Perish the thought,
but some people did say the Twopem y had bsen
“ got ab," as when the m itch came off he couldn't
even shy straight. The present team have in-
heri ed tha characteristic! of Charley Laurence s
lot, soon getting very tired. OldCca'ley Laurence
used to say the greatest trouble wilh the darkies
was when they got a man out, Djwu they’d squat
and Chw ley used to swear that he had to go round
with a stick to rouse them.

Talking of the lei gfch of time for which

“ Fish" Smart is still the fastest skater—or fastest
runner on skates—in the old country. For at

“ Fish ” at his particular game, but in Holland,

It Is an old belief of breeders of blood-
stock that speed comes from the dam's side. This
will appear to apply equally to the genus homo as
to the equine species. At a recent carters’ picnic

Race" (open only to carters’ wives) Mrs. Frobert
ran first, Mr?. Hill second, and Mrs. Sindlen third.
In a subsequent race, open to carters’ daughters,
Miss Sindlen was first, Miss M. Hill second, and

John Smith, the owner of that game N.Z.
mare, Maid of Honour, was a live sport, bub very
eccentric. Before every race in which he had a
horse entered, he would waddle down to the
weighing-room, and say to bis jock,, in stentorian
tones, “ My hlnstruotions Is to go like h— all the
way, and to win.” Poor old Jack, when the grim
destroyer hovered round his pain-racked couch,
and the med’cal adviser at length hinted at harps
and golden crown?, said, “Lo k hero, doctor,
111 lay yon fitly to nothlrg I croak." The doctor
shook his head, for ha liked old Jack, and smiled
fa'ntly. “ A hundred, then," said tha dying man,
earnestly. “Book it 1" Haltaa-hour latar Ja">k
had won his wager. His mausoleum Is in the
Auckland cemetery, c’ose to tha modest graves of
Governor Hobson and Judge Stephen.

In excuse of hia present policy, Lori
Salisbury, we read, recently said; “I believe
there Is an amusement] popular in Canada called
tobogganing ; when you begin to go down tha
hill you must follow the course which those who
started it have designed for you; you must fo’-
law it, though you rese ve to yourself aoundant
rights to denounce with any amount of energy of
language those who set you cn that downward
career." It’s pretty evident that the noble mar-
quis never went down a toboggan s ids, or h*
wouldn’t conceive the possibility of denouncing
anybody during the process. Oace the toboggan
Is fairly whistli'g over the frozen siow a fellow
haa nn mo e thought for the world, the fl.eh ard
the othar chap until he gets to the bottom of the
slide. He may be holding t'gbt to the nioast girl
he knows, with the nexo nicest girl holding him
in a deathlike grip, and yet a fello w thinks of no-
thing at all. There is neither joy nor sorrow,
love nor hate, blessing nor de muciatlo-J, on a
toboggan which has been properly shoved off.

The Victorian Cricketers’ Asicciation re-

Surely the time has arrived Lr dividing Austra-
lian “amateurs” into two classes-the men who
don’t want payment for their lees of time, and
the men who do. As there is not sufficient] popu-
lation to support much professional cricket, the
interests cf the game demand that semi prufes
sionalism shall he recognised and fairly dealt with.
Twc-thirds of our leading “gentlemen” cricketers
would be forced to join the “players” InEagland,
if they wished to figure in country teams, for no
obliging banka or private firms wtuld allow them
tha leaves of absence they enjoy here. But,
although they are favoured In this respect, they
have also a right to expect their ordinary wages
to be provided by the cricket club or association
at whose invitation they knock off work. In the

ssked for £4 10s. and £4 Bj. respectively— rot very
exorbitant claims, anyhow.

The measure of the Sixth Australian
Eievea was fairly taken last week, when (hsy
scored —weather conditions bsirg equally favour-
ab eto both sides—an Innings of 219. against 221
made by the MC, C. Englishmen. It was evident
to a child that the Englishmen's superior batting
and fielding enabled them to told their own,
while the weaknes s of their trundling was none
the less apparent because they clean bowled seven
of cur boys. There cm be no earthly doubt that
Turner, Ferris, Garrett, Trott, and Bryle want
more playing than Psel, Attewell, Beaumont,
Stoddart, and Walter Read. Yet observe! The
Englishmen want la fl'Bfc on Friday, and be'ore 4
o’clock had scored 183 runs. The Australians
open on Saturday with 43 to their credit, and at
4 o’clock they have a total of 160, making 11/
runs scored in rather ie s rime than the Britishers
took to make 185 These figures speak for our
batting or against our fielding, and they are by no
means exoep’ional. The Britishers nearly always
score fastest by the watch.

book on the local Jockey Club meeting. You
may see him foremost among the crowd Drying,
“ Who's going to tack the double for the Flying
Handicap ?' He generally clears enough at two
meetings to withstand the wretched stipend-fund
tendered by his unmindful flock

Ovners of selling racers are so used <o
buying in the winners at their own prices that
they wax quite wroth when an a* imal is run up
to a decent figure, and when such an event does
occur, some fan is sure to ensue. When Saldler’s
Wind, tha winner of the Mutual Selling Rmo
was put up, Mr. Kennedy, the owner of Gen
E gin, who ran third in the race, commenced bid-
ding and compelled the owner to part with £145
before he was knocked down. Tola so ‘ riled"
Mr. Bill that he claimed Glen Elgin, and co soon
as the horse was put up he bid £125, at which
price the gelding was knocked down to him. Glen
Elgin could hardly put foot to ground when he re-
turned to scale, so Mr. Hill got rather the worst
of the deal.

and Pitt streets, Sydney, has again changed Pa
name. It started in life as “ Triokett’s," then
became “ Patch's," then “Callaghan's,” next
“ Deeble's,” and is now known as “Beach’s.”
If Kemp can only hang on to the shadow of the
championship long enough, we may expect to see
another change. Such la fame.

N.S.W. Land Nationalsiation League.
On Tuesday nex\ the 13. h inet, at 8 p.m., a
meeting will bn held at the Temperance Hal),
Pitt street, Sydney, to adoot the manifesto and
rules of the Sydney branch tf the Laid Nationali-
sation League (the text of which we print below).
The adoption of the manifesto will ba moved by
Mr. W H, Traill, and secD-dei by Mr. K. W.
Foxall : -
“ M inifestn of the Land Nationalisation League
of NS W. Motto: ‘The La-.d fo: tin People.’
We hold—
“ 1. 'lhat the absolute owne-?hip cf land Ir-
volves an injustice, because it is contrary to the
fundamental principle which should regulate the
distributlcn of the prodcc'scf human exertion.
Th's principle 1s that eaoh man has a right to
enjoy the fruits of his own industry.
“ 2. That all products are the outoome of the
operation of labour upon land ; while land, on the
contrary, is not the result of human exertion, but
ie the free gift of the Almighty to all his creature
for their sustenance and enjoyment.
“3. That absolute ownership of land makes
possible for those who own it to secure a share ,
the products of labour without any exertion
their part.
“ 1 That the value of land arises from the
senoe and needs of the whole coromur itv. W
therefore, deem it just and wise that this value
should be taken by the State, and used for
here St of the community.
“5. That God h.s given the earth for the usa
and benefit of all mankind. This being ignored
by o- r present social system, we feel it to be our
duty to assert this right, which we te’isve can bo
successfully accomplish* and by placing a tax on the
unimproved value of all land. We therefore pro-
pose to introduce such a tax, and increase it
gradually so as to absorb the whole of the value
of land irrespective of Improvements snd we be-
lieve that the amount thus received will meet all
the revenue requirements of ths State.
“ 6 That there is enough in the world to
abundantly sustain the life and minister to the
enjoyment of the whole of the human race; and
what is needed for the abolition of that poverty
which manifests itself in a)l the large cities of the
world—where multitudes a k In vain to be
allowed to work-Is, that the equ a l rights of
all men to the bounties of nature be reoegilsed.
“ We wish to call attention to the fact thai we
do net propose to tax buildings or any improve-
ments that the owner may have put open his
land. We hold that he has an indisputable right
to such ; and wo deem it unjust and unwiss in
any way to discourage the improvement of land :
because it Is to the benefit of the community that
all land should bo improved to the utmost, ana
put to the most profitable use
“ We wish it to he clearly understood that wa
propose taxing land accordlrg to Its unimproved
value, and not according to its extent. For ex ■
ample, one acre In a city is frequently worth more
than 100,000 acres in the country, and as the un-
improved value of both has been created by the
community, we claim it to be strictly just that the
community should enjoy the benefit of the vamf
it has created ; this can be easily accomp reho
by taxing land accordlrg to its unimproved value.
“ It is impossible that the Fatherhood of GOO
and the brotherhood of man can he universally
recognised nnder the present social system, ", a _
has produced tuch disastrous results. We, there-
fore call with confidence upon all who havetho we •
fare of their fellow-creatures at heart, to aid u
in our efforts to introduce a system more in ac-
cord with the fundamental p inoiples of Justice*
