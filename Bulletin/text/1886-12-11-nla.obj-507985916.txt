Wanted—An, Expurgated Bible.
In an era of comparative refinement and
delicacy, when all else has been brought into
harmony with the spirit of the age, the Bible
alone, of all standard literature, stands pro-
minently forward as the evidence of a former
age of coarseness and lewdness. The period
from which the Protestant Bible dates—
from it a majority, including the pre-
sent writer, have been taught—is pre-
eminent in English history for indecency
of speech and licentiousness of maiAers. A
Wealthy and leisured class had arisen and
become established in the nation, but they
lacked mental occupation. Their only tastes
were sensual and brutish ; culture was un-
thought of by the aristocracy as a class, and
politics—then consisting almost entirely of a
struggle of might against might—afforded
occupation only to a narrow minority. The
superfluous energy of the wealthy was,
therefore, for want of a better use, devoted
to sensuality and debauchery. Like their
Australian prototypes the ignorant and
purse-proud sons of coarse convict fathers—
the nobles under the Troon and Stuart
dynasties found their chief enjoyment in the
pursuit of vice, and their conversation was
mainly occupied in its recital. Elizabeth,
James L, and Charles 11. used language,
even upon State occasions, which would now
be prohibited in a pot-heuse, and the Court,
even under the “ Virgin Queen,” was
the scene of open and shameless breaches
of every canon _ of the moral code. The
Iqwer classes, steeped in ignorance and
dominated by superstition, were not slow to
imitate the vices of the Court,Jihe nobles,
and the clergy ; the infection of licentious-
ness, generated in the reeking atmosphere of
exclusive circles, permeated and poisoned,
the entire populace. The result of this
national depravity is seen in the literature of
the period. Shakespeare’s dramas are too
gross to be performed in the original text,
and wholesale expurgation is made in defer-
ance to modern refinement, yet he was
the cleanest writer of his century upon
any but severely philosophical or polemical
subjects. And little of the literature of the
16th and 17th centuries is popularly known,
the bulk of it having long since been laid
aside as indecent, while what remains
has been saved from oblivion only by
the aid of expurgation. Yet the Bible,
though bearing large evidence of the im-
morality of the age in which it was pro-
duced, has been subjected to no such friendly
treatment; as it was in the days of the
licentious Tudors and sensual Stuarts, so it
is in this 19th century, when even the men-
tion of Hell in newspaper columns is con-
sidered an outrage on the customs of the age.
* * *
It must be distinctly understood that we
do not here venture to affirm or deny the
pretensions of the Bible. The genuineness
of that volume is a question for each man to
settle for himself. We are not now con-
cerned with its authorship or its truth, but
simply with the language employed and
some of the stories it relates. Bishop Barry
in urging that the Freethinker should be ex-
pelled from Sydney School of Arts wrote :
“This is not a question of theology but a
question of decency similarly, it is in the
Interests of public decency alone that we
ask for the expurgation of the Bible. And
such a demand is within the clear rights of
journalism, for this is a question affecting
public morals and manners. Every week
from at least a dozen metropolitan pulpits,
clergymen who have never been in a theatre
howl for the purgation of a stage which they
condemn on hearsay evidence ; constantly
denunciations of racecourses are made by
men who have never seen what goes on
there, and if these demands for reform were
based upon good foundation of known fact
they could not be impeached on the grounds
of right ; so we, with full knowledge of
that concerning which we write, urge the
necessity for the removal of incitements to
immorality, and suggestions to vice, now
contained in the Bible.
* * *
It is strange that church people them-
selves have not long since effectively moved
in this matter. There is not at the present
time a greater obstacle to the influence of
Scripture teaching than the grossness with
which this teaching is surrounded. Parsons
urge men to read the Bible through and fol-
low its precepts. The anxious pupil in re-
ligion begins the study, and is almost imme-
diately confronted by a needless indecency
of language which would not be tolerated in
the Evening News. He finds the body of
revelation covered with a mantle of gross-
ness, and, disgusted and offended by the
terms employed and the scenes recorded, he
casts away the Bible for ever ; or, finding
that the obscure passages awaken his slum-
bering propensities to vice, he gloats over
these, and the last state of this man is worse,
far w T orse, than the first. Or, perhaps as an
earnest enquirer he goes to church in hopes of
profiting by the teaching he may there re-
ceive. He is interested, but unfortunately
happens to find that the reading of Scrip-
ture includes some tale too gross to be
admissible on the stage of the lowest music-
hall. Then he goes away and joins himself
to the great army of social pessimists, and
believing that morality is a lost quantity m
the world, betakes himself to such conduct
as best accords with that view. Similar
debasing effects are noticeable even with the
clergy/ In the Church of England but little
latitude is usually allowed as to the portions
of Scripture read, yet not infrequently this
latitude is used for the purpose of inflicting
corrupt passages, such as minister to pru-
riency and offend virtue, upon the congrega-
tion. Many ministers seem positively to
revel in the chapters most in need of expur-
gation, reading them with a boldness that
they dare not show for the purpose of using
language not one-tenth as coarse outside the
church walls. And to this continual dab-
bling with the indecent may largely be
attributed the frequency with which clergy-
men, despite their high professions and com-
parative freedom from temptation, break
through the sanctity of the marital contract.
Whether a similar influence holds sway over
the church-goers it is impossible to say posi-
tively, but it is unreasonable to assert that
no such influence is to be feared. It is
noticeable that every one of the nine Mount
Rennie convicts are returned as adherents of
various religions. Indecent publications in
the Sydney daily press are frequently alleged
as incitement to such outrages, but it is at
least equally probable that obscene Scripture
passages may have been the primary insti-
gators to evil.
* * *
It is not necessary to dilate at length upon
the various features of this subject. The
evil is too commonly known and lamented to
demand extended illustration. And it is
lamented most by the most sincere of
Christians. They can see that religion and
coarseness, piety and indecency, are not
allied, but at strife with one another ; and
they also can perceive that it is disgraceful
that matter, which, on account of moral
repulsiveness, cannot be spoken on any
licensed stage, or published in the columns
of a sensation-mongering evening paper, can
still be exhibited in the book from which
Christian creeds are taken, and epenly read
in any chureh to a congregation consisting
largely of chaste and modest matrons and
their innocent and sensitive daughters. The
man who takes ladies to any theatre in Syd-
ney may be reasonably certain that nothing
will be said to offend the most refined ear,
but the man who takes his sisters to church
may have to listen with them to indecent, ob-
scene, and immoral language. The anomaly
is shameful to Christians, but it will never
be remedied until the laity themselves
undertake the necessary reform. The vested
interests of the clergy are too great to
permit of their inaugurating a reform. Once
the ipse disc it of a parson, libertine and
scoundrel though he might be, was deemed
conclusive, but it is otherwise in the present
day. Daily the laity are making the church
more democratic, and grasping concessions
so long withheld by their clerical superiors,
and this concession of an expurgated Scrip-
ture must be the subject of determined
movement in the near future. Churchmen
must demand it in the interest of their creed
itself; those who do not belong to any
church will demand that the reform be made
for the sake of public morality and decency.
* * *
To bring this subject within the arena of
controversy is the first and most important
step towards the desired end. The result-
ing discussion must inevitably lead, although
by slow stages, to the necessary reform. But
in all discussion it must never be forgotten
that “ THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF THEOLOGY
BUT A QUESTION OF DECENCY,”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Boycott the Chinese!
It ia a melancholy fact that the Chinese arc chiefly
supported in Australia by that class whom their
presence most injures, and threatens to degrade.
It is the labouring classes who make trade for the
Chinese labourers, whether these latter are furni-
ture makers, cabbage-growers, shop-keepers, or
fan-tan runners. The mean-looking, dirty little
shop of the Mongolian rarely attracts other cus-
tomers than those who have to earn their daily
food by daily labour : bereft of such patronage
the Chinese retail shops would close at once, the
gardens be deserted, the fan-tan tables forsaken,
and an immediate exodus to the Flowery Land
ensue. The Australian w-orkmen are nourishing a
power that, with the attainment of a little addi-
tional strength, will battle with them for their
very bread. Every sixpence spent is so much
assistance to the enemy. And, although the Aus-
tralian mechanic is, by dealing with them, simply
purchasing his own oppression, he can hardly be
blamed for his folly. To him the saving of six-
pence is an important consideration, and over-
powers ulterior considerations. Domestic is to
him of more moment than political economy. And
the result of his purchase is not traceable to a par-
ticular effect. If he did not buy, others would
continue to do so, therefore he finds it hard to
deny himself the immediate advantage. If others
were willing to abstain he would likewise keep
away from the Chinese shops, and help to starve
the enemy out, but to renounce an advantage
which his fellow-workers readily take, seems a
senseless and quixotic proceeding. For this in-
creasing evil there is only one remedy. A “self-
denying ordinance,” or league must be formed
so that distinction may be made between
those who are for the Chinese, and those
who are against them. In the United States,
as well as in various North Queensland towns,
action more or less severe has been taken in the
way suggested. The Chinese shops are watched
and purchasers registered on a “black list;” the
system is that same description of “boycott,”
which, adopted by trades-unions, has been the
means of elevating Labour from bondage to
liberty. The supporters of Chinese are considered
as “ blacklegs,” and social enemies to their united
fellows, and by this means the arms of the Mon-
golian Octopus are amputated. How necessary
action of this kind is in New South Wales the
records of each week,show. New shops are being
almost daily opened in Sydney and the country
towns, and Chinese labourers continually come to
closer quarters with their Australian competitors.
Once Chinese were only employed on stations as
cooks, and that very rarely, then they began to
compete in scrub-cutting, and ring-barking, next
a few boundary riders of the same nation were
employed, and now squads of Chinamen are being
taught how to shear so as to be ready for next
season. Similar advances are being made in very
many other departments of labour. Land has
been secured in Woolloomooloo for a Chinese
laundry, and oigar-making and boot-making are
shortly to bo “ assisted ” by Chinese labour Only
a few days since when a lawn-tennis ground was
to be laid out in one of the Sydney suburbs a gang
of Chinamen were employed, although 2000 men
in Sydney alone are waiting wearily for any kind
of work. All these things, intrinsically un-
important, are portentous of evil. To provide
against the coming ill there is only one re-
medy—and we have no hesitation in calling it
by its ugliest name —there must be a “boycott”
of the Chinese, and of those who buy their goods
or their labour, or who work for them, accept
them as tenants, or deal with them in any manner
whatsoever. This is the only way to purge the
land of the Mongolian plague.

The Sydney City Elections.
Last week the city of Sydney was called upon to
fill up the annual rotation vacancies in the civic
chamber. Eight aldermen were to be elected ; in
three of the wards the previously sitting represen-
tatives were returned unopposed ; and in four out
of the remaining five the old aldermen defeated
their opponents. The only new man sent into the
municipal den was Mr, Jeanneret, who contrived
to poll four votes over Alderman Moore. One
would suppose, therefore, that the inhabitants ot
“ this great city,” as Sydney Town Hall orators are
delighted to call it, are perfectly satisfied with the
manner in which their affairs are conducted by
the municipal authorities. A more crushing de-
feat for the advocates of change of manage-
ment would be so nearly impossible that
we may consider this a complete rout. If
Mr. Moore had only whipped in five ad-
ditional rate-payers the whole crew of fumblers
and muddlers would have got back to the Council
Chamber without the loss of a man. And the
elections must be regarded as a practical endorse-
ment Of the thefts, and scarcely less culpable
bungles, that have disgraced the city for years.
The game will now go on more merrily than ever.
The solitary representative of the reform party,
who just secured his election in Bourke Ward,
had better at once abandon all idea of cleaning
out the Augean stables, take a few easy lessons in
the art of polished brigandage, and be hail fellow
well met with the most conscienceless
of Iris brother aldermen. It is useless
kicking against the pricks, and this Mr. Jean-
neret will doubtless quickly discover. The cause
of this curious result is not hard to seek. In the
five wards where the elections were contested
9844 votes were polled, exclusive of in-
formal votes. Out of these the defeated
candidates scored 4212, so that practically
the issue was decided by 5632 votes, representing
probably less than a third of that number of rate-
payers. The Act ot Parliament by virtue whereof
“ this great city” is governed by a mere handful
of persons—a large proportion of whom are not
even residents within the city boundaries —is one
of those measures Sir Henry Parkes is so puffed
up with pride at having been instrumental in pas-
sing. The effect of the law is simply to disfran-
chise seven-tenths of the occupiers, and to hand
the whole control of civic affairs over to the land-
lords. The people, therefore, need not feel dis-
graced in respect of last week’s performance. They
were powerless for any good purposes. The dis-
credit of the business rests with the wretched law
which disqualifies the real ratepayers from voting,
and with those great “Liberal” statesmen who
had to do with enacting that law. The only way
to attack the city council, clearly, is through the
Parliament. The late elections have performed
the signal service of proving this, and if the people
will only exert their power when the more im-
portant elections take place in such a manner that
“ Liberals ” of the Parkes kidney are effectually
brushed aside as impostors deserve to be, the
work of municipal reform will be made easy, for
no truly liberal assembly would tolerate for a
day a state of things in which the real ratepayers
of Sydney are incontinently cheated by the nofni-
nees of a set of grinding property-owners.
Poor Jefferis I
The Pitt-street Congregational Chapel hag been
running for no less than forty-six j ears, during
which time a great deal of noise has emanated
from its walls. The nuisance—for it must be an
infliction to many of the neighbours—has been
borne with for nigh half a century without a word
of complaint. Lately, concerts of sacred and
classical music have been performed in a not very
adjacent theatre on Sunday evenings, and the
horror and indignation of Dr. Jefferis and his
congregation thereat are unspeakable. Last week
Mr. Dibbs was interviewed on the subject, and
coolly requested to cancel the license of the offend*
ing theatre, on the ground that the sound of dis-
tant music interfered with the church service. Dr.
Jefferis explained that his church boasted no
fewer than 500 members, and for the sake of these
500 people he would have the Colonial Secretary
commit a distinct violation of the law in a direc-
tion affecting in a most arbitrary manner the
liberties of the whole body of the public. His-
tory repeats itself with remarkable precision
where religion is in the case. Less than a
century ago the Church of England was at'
tempting to shut up Nonconformist chapels
for reasons precisely similar to those advanced by
these Congregationahsts for shutting up Sunday
evening concerts. They were an invasion of the
monopoly of the church to teach, preach, and
edify. But it is too late in the day for such
claims to be seriously considered. The Church
had to give way to the dissenters, and mow the
dissenters will have to give way to the theatres.
Many people who believe in no church desire some
rational and elevating recreation'on the Day o ’
Rest; and the time is fast approaching when they
will have it, let Dr. Jefferis and his Five Hun
dred howl and whine as they choose. Nobody
wants to interfere with the Pitt-street chapel, but
everybody is concerned to restrain the members o:’
that organisation from interfering with the rights
and liberties of the rest of the community.

Contradictory Evidence.
When two witnesses flatly contradict each other
on oath as to certain simple facts, the Judge
frowns and informs them in severe tones that one
or the other must be guilty of perjury. And o::
all offences in the world perjury is the most hate
ful to judges, since it imperils and perverts the
administration of justice. Yet Sydney has been
recently affronted by the wrangling of two high
personages—one a Supreme Court Judge, and the
other ex-Chief Justice Salomons— giving two
radically different accounts of what transpired at
certain interviews, and each declaring the other’s
version to be “entirely without foundation.”
Even judicial functionaries, it appears, occa-
sionally resort to false statement when to
tell the plain truth would land them in
a difficulty. After this the Legislature ought
to lose no time in blotting out the crime of
perjury from the Statute Book, while the various
church bodies might fittingly deliberate as to the
propriety of eliminating the Ninth Commandment
from the Decalogue. For if judges fail igno-
minously to obey this law, spiritual and temporal,
clearly it is hopeless to expect much success on
the part of the common ruck of humanity, audit is
absurd and cruel to insist upon men being better
than they can be. The variance between Justice
Windeyer and Mr. Salomons is not over a mat-
ter of any complexity or subtlety, Mr. Salomons
asserts that Mr. Windeyer was “ insolent ” in
his mode of “ volunteering ” his disapprobation
of the former’s appointment to the Chief Justice-
ship, and that he persisted in adversely criticising
that appointment despite Mr. Salomons’ re-
peated efforts to stop him. Mr, Windeyer de-
clares this, version of the conversation in re-
ference to be “entirely without founda-
tion,” and asserts that Mr, Salomon’s
“ extorted ” an expression of opinion from
him, which he reluctantly gave. We shall
not attempt to decide who is the furthest from
the truth in this controversy. The whole business
is disgraceful beyond measure. Mr. Justice
Faucett’s candid and gentlemanly admission
that in his first letter to the Press he fell into an
important error of statement, contrasts strikingly
with the rigid adherence to their earlier accounts
by Messrs. Windeyer and Salomons, and is the
single redeeming feature in a pot and kettle game
that would be only contemptible if the disputants
were a pair of fish-fags, but, in view of the position
of the parties, clearly amounts to a seemdaluvi
magnatum.

Mr. B. R. Wise a Convert to
Protection.
Months ago when all the pseudo-Freetrade news-
papers of Sydney “turned dog ” on their principles
and advocated Protection of the iron industry, we
assented that they would ever desert their fan-
tastic theories when put to a similar test. Now,
the most intelligent and keen of all New South
Wales Freetraders, Mr. B. R. Wise, has similarly-
given up all the points of his contention by urging
—while still posing as a Cobdenite —the useful-
ness of extending Protection to native industries.
He does not renounce his theories by advocating
tariff protection, but favours direct encourage-
ment by Government preference of local manu-
factures by bonus and reduced railway fares
and freights. The first plan is a species of protec-
tion which has some serious disadvantages. If,
as Mr. Wise suggests, the Government were to
prefer local tenderers for work paid for by loan
funds, this would be in many cases to restrict the
benefit of one firm and its employes, while the
extra cost would fall upon the whole community.
Thus, if railway engines were all ordered hence-
forth from colonial makers, Mort and Co., and
perhaps two other firms alone would benefit,
while the extra cost would fall upon all who are
liable for the interest on the loan. Under a
system of tariff-protection only those who buy the
taxed article are forced to feel the effect of the
duty. Even with these disadvantages we believe
that direct protection of thi i kind is desirable for
many important reasons, but under ordinary
circumstances a system which has more of
equity in its incidence must be infinitely pre-
ferable. Bonuses, which Mr. Wise urges as
another means of “ encouragement to native
industries,” are still more inequitable in operation.
Suppose for instance that the Government gra it a
bonus to A of so much per yard on all the tweed
he manufactures. Then A will be able to sell for
a price which will enable him to compete in cer-
tain lines; but though his customers may not ex-
ceed one in a thousand of the population the other
999 must pay their share of the bonus in taxes or
otherwise, in order that A and his customer may
profit. The resultant evil is obvious. Free-traders
constantly allege that the amount of duty to be
imposed on an article is the subject of “ lobbying,
log-rolling, and corruption,” and this although the
benefit may have to be divided amongst hundreds
of competing manufacturers. But under the
bonus system, where the benefit is personal, direct,
and definite, corruption must ensue as a natural
consequence of human depravity. The third
remedy proposed by Mr. Wise is a reduction of
the railway freights. On the grounds of equity


this has still less to recommend it. The railways
at present are a heavy tax—over £700,080
a year—on the community, of whom very
few are railway consignors. A reduction
of present freights would most probably
mean increased loss to be provided for by taxa-
tion : here again the whole community would
lose* in order that a few consignors and con-
sumers might benefit. With tariff protection the
result would be just the reverse. All the commu-
nity would profit by the imposition of duty, for all
would share in the benefit accruing from the
revenue produced, and only upon consumers of
the taxed article would the duty fall. None of
the expedients suggested by Mr. Wise can com-
pare either in efficacy or fairness with protection
through the Custom House. But, haring admitted*
that Protection in these three forms is a good
thing, he has done much to narrow the question
in dispute. The contention in future, as far as he
is concerned, will not be “Freetrade v. Protec-
tion,” but “Protection by tariff v. Protection by
bonus.” As ho admits that competition may be
profitably limited, the only question now remain-
ing can be as to the best methods of effecting that
limitation.
*
The Sydney Echo has solved the Mount Bennie
conundrum. The answer is given in these oracu-
lar words : “Itis to be feared that for this de-
velopment of crime a section of the press is not
altogether free from blame .... A recent
divorce case introduced to the larrikin imagina-
tion the idea of community in crime. A strug-
gling section of the press has often become pros-
perous on filthy reports, and the result is that
there is a tendency to prefer impurity to cleanli-
ness.” Which last sentence is probably a lament
that the coppers of the public do not gravitate
towards the Echo coffers. One point is worth
consideration—lf indecent reports of divorce
suits induced larrikins to hold a carnival of crime,
Echo leaders must also have some effect on our
social state. For this effect we search the records
of lunacy, and find that 3203 insane persons were
medically treated during 1885, and that there are
now in confinement .507 more insane persons than
there were ten years ago. But to come back to the
publication of indecent matter. Even the Echo
will acknowledge that this may have one or two
effects—it may either lessen crime or make it in-
crease. And the motives of publication may be
either personal gain in coppers, or national gain in
a higher morality. Motives of personal gain in
publication almost invariably lead to national loss
in the advance of evil. The Echo, in a style that
jrjjaj- lead to mistake as to motives, attacks some
fivai evening papers for publishing in the interests
pf their circulation indecent matter. The charge
may be a perfectly just one, but a review of the-
subject does pot lead to unlimited com-
mendation of the Echo. The latter has al-
ways been known as an ultra-respectable
paper: a down-the-harbour orgie it would only
describe generally as “improper,” or “not of a
morally elevating nature ” ; to publish any details
or to show reasons for the excision of such an
ulcer would offend its very moral and sen.
sitive readers, and would even diminish the circu-
lation. Therefore it is the policy of the Echo to
overlook and by silence consent to the continuance
of social evils. Who ever heard of the Echo
risking the loss of one subscriber by exposing any
system of crime ? Maunderings over crimes that
have already been punished is the limit of its
moral agency. Admitting, then, that there is an
evening paper in Sydney that publishes literary
garbage and thus increases crime, the fact is still
apparent that another paper, the Echo, refrains
from checking rampant and continued crime by
refusing to visit it with fatal exposure. And the
policy pursued is in each case, accidentally or not,
that which is best calculated to sell the paper. Is I
ft worse, then, to make money by urging the I
publps pn to evil, than to grow rich by condoning
prime? Either course is selfish, immoral, and
Utterly wropg, and neither journal in adopting
the one has the shadow of justification in censur-
ing the other.
Hear this, oh Ecpo, hear this truth sublime—
He who condones foul ,conduct shares the crime.

“ New South Wales has now a definite duty to I
perform to Mr. Barley,” says one Sydney daily, I
and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, whilst I
savagely attacking the Ministry for not retrench- I
ing all round, urges that a substantial addition to I
the Chief Justice’s salary should be made. Pre- I
sumably this increase is required as a compensa I
tion personal to Mr. Barley : it is thought that I
the present salary is not sufficient for him, and I
must, therefore, be augmented. This is a new I
way of dealing with Chief Justices. The D.T, I
probably desires to introduce a sort of sliding I
j»cfll,e of pay, variation to be made according to the I
qifa#tfty of mental vigour that the Chief Justice I

“lacks dignity,” at £lO,OO, and Mr. Justice Win- I
Lexer at (say) £lO a week. But even with I
adjustment on these lines Mr. Barley would get
badly “ feft.” Sir Jajies Martin was content to

The perseverance of New South Wales Civil ser-
vants in searching for arguments against the
recent extension of hours is only equalled by the
utter absurdity of the arguments when found. We
have perused many reams of indignant trash,
alleged answers to previous articles, and had
despaired of finding anything pew, when the
screed of-a Post official proved that the d»pth of stu-
pendous stupidity had not theretofore beenroached.
After trotting out all the bald-headed and dodder-
ing assertions that have been so wearily exhibited
j°r weeks past, he proceeds to display some
facts ” which certainly have a breezy odour of
freshness and novelty about them, Let us’ tran-
scribe a few bars of his bray :
J ‘Without doubt, both physically and morally, the length-
en hours will affect the civil servants. You must admit
jnat the majority of our athletes are Civil servants. They
uave not sufficient time at their disposal to indulge in any
«yort whatever,'and the result ja our athletics will soon be-
ext.net. . . It >s rumoured that there is a great
railing oft in trade about the city this last week, which is
attributed to the alteration in the hours of the service. If
such is the case—as I believe it is—what benefit will the
UonviT v' 4 , and col ?? y /? ei ;' ve from these lengthened
liours . You know it was the Civil servant’s hobby to parade
the town with his darling after four o’clock, and purchase
"T **?' cy J oodfS > &c -> and m this way spend his easily-earned
money. Since the hour has been altered from four to live he
! s H°aWe to perform this pleasant duty. The Government in
trying to retrench, by making the service work longer, so as
A a few - °f. th . em < have caused a depression
amongst shopkeepers in the town."
Moses lamenting the ruin of Nineveh (or was it
Job ?) was not a sadder spectacle than this young*
man bewailing the ruin of athletics. But we
might urge that if the Civil Service athlete is
f uch a delicate young man that 74 hours of quill-
driving will do him physical injury, his perform-
ances in the way of muscular effort arc not likely
to extend beyond competition for the cigarette
chewing championship and high-collar-wearing
cup. But our deepest sympathies are “on tap”
when the decline of “block-bruising” is men-
turned. We don’t pity the Civil servant whose
hobby it was to parade the town with his dar-
ling, and purchase her fancy goods,” nor do we
even pity the shopkeeper, for wo are painfully
aware of the fact that Government mashers have
not hitherto been considered the most reliable
marks” by tailors and others, but we do pity
the darlings ” whom an unfeeling regulation has
brutally erushed. And we pity the habitues
of the block, for much masculine beauty that for-
merly was visible between I and 5 p.m. is now
conspicuously not there. Nature usually ladles
out good looks to the man to whom she sternly
refuses brains, and thus it is that there is more
loveliness to the square inch among members of
Ihe Sen ice than in any other offices in town.
We think our present correspondent must, bo
beautiful. He receives £152 per annum, and,
taking his letter as a sample of his mental force,
we are puzzled to know what on earth he receives
that sum for, if not as a tribute to his personal
loveliness.
The N.S.W. Drink Commission.
That fine old Silurian fossil, the N.B.W. Drink
Commission, is still pounding along on its dreary-
way, though no one knows and hardly anyone
• cares about its progress. At some long-forgotten
glacial period of A ustralia’s history a committee
of three teetotallers and three publicans was ap-
pointed, whose business it was to supply dia-
grams of the Niagaras of colonial beer, and
geysers of other rubbish poured annually down
the cornstalk throat. This was considered a
reasonable way of striking an average, for the
three publicans would naturally regard their col-
leagues as dry-rot fanatics, while the teetotallers
were certain to set down the publicans as bowel-
less wretches, belonging to a class most of whom
grew fat on swipes and delirium tremens . Un-
fortunately. however, two more teetotallers were
subsequently appointed; the publicans thereupon
resigned, and the commissioners have, apparently—
so far as useful results are concerned—suspended
everything except their salaries. How not to run
any chance whatever of doing it, even by accident
seems to have been their aim. The Government
analysts were specially examined as to the effect
ot‘ alcohol, just as if they had ever endured a re-
covery from three days of rum and orange snakes
in a bush shanty ; the medical officers were con-
sulted as to the craving for drink, whereas
the testifier wanted was the thirsty digger
who has sat down on the sand half
way between Kimberley and the other end of a
parched and dusty nowhere, and howled on his
deity to open the windows of Heaven and rain
down anything from bottled porter to absinthe on
the thirsty land ; and lastly the clergy—including
even Bishop Barry— were called upon to give
evidence hs to the best means of arresting drunken-
ness, &c. Yet, unless a bishop has himself been
arrested for drunkenness, he can know nothing
about this point, except at second-hand, and the
colony wants some more practical remedies than
church and collection-plate ; and from his clerical
position he is no better qualified to give an un-
biassed ( pinion on drink than is a hymna to sit in
a committee on frozen meat. Ap honoured cor-
respondent of Thk Bulletin, who describes him-
self as having been found hopelessly drunk on five
continents, and as having spent enough on experi-
ments connected with, beginning with, and ending
with drink to swamp the whole commission,
anxiously draws our attention to these points’
and urges that the confirmed drunkards of the
community should be called in evidence, and also
that a drunken lawyer should be allowed to cross-
examine when necessary. This would at least
have the merit of allowing both sides of the case
to be heard, and would add a little interest to the
petrified show which has sunk so completely into
oblivion. As matters now stand, the inquiry is
being conducted by teetotallers who are pledged
by their creed to bring in a whole-souled curse and
c # a rpport, and therefore nobody will earn
twopenpe for tppjp or thp dopumpnt. Tpey are
relyjng solely op the evidence of men who
have never been drunk, or who dare not admit
it if they have been; and they are waiting
patiently till the public have forgotten their
existence, and then they will flop down a fore-
doomed, abandoned bullock-load of waste paper
on the table of the Assembly, and present 10 acres
of bill for fppir salaries and depart. Nobpdy pars?
a straw fpr tfipir labours,” foy tfipy have effec-
tually discounted ail public interest long ago.
Unless the Commissioners can strike some new
source of information they will acquire no know-
ledge that every intelligent colonist does not
already possess, and, as the Commission serves
merely as an outlet for expenditure, the best
thing that can be done by the Ministry is to stop
the salaries, discharge the five formalist;* wuq
liave sat so long and hatched opp s'p lYttl'p, and
send an ei^pty-Fop jihgipe, with fu trucks, to re-
move t|>eif accumulated records at the earliest
possible moment.
Apropos of the Mount Rennie case, there is
room for a good deal of improvement in the method
pf gfftt|pgmp evidence adopted by the police of
Sydney, in that instance a iot hr promiscuous
and seedy individuals of the larrikin stamp were
paraded before the victim and recognised by her
with surprising facility. This was, of course, a
powerful compliment to the force. They went
flahing, necessarily rather at random, among a
population of 313,000 people, in search of a dozen
men whose names even the girl did not know, and
ihp identified the prisoners as fast as they were
run In. Bat, just te givp arrested ppoplp ip gpnpral
a shadow of a chance for their fives', ft youlu bp
as well in such cases to mix a few persons known
to be thoroughly above suspicion, with the gang,
and watch the result. The Judges, for instance,
are necessarily of spotless reputation, so they
might Jiavp dressed in shabby attire, and
passed along with the tost. Tips plan is com-
mended for the consideration of the Chief of
Police. f

We drink to the health of William Beach
—and may he never keep a pub. ! May his anvil
never be a bar ! Still there rings in our ears the
funeral-bell of a man who, hut a few years pre-
viously a fine sculler, physically degenerated
amidst his stock of rum-bottles until he sank into
the tomb. It is a miserable thing to see a great
athlete become a whisky-show—no more pitiable
sight is there on earth than that of the mighty
man of muscle, once an example to all men, who
has fallen from his high estate and become a pub-
lican with a seat in the City Council. There are a
good many hundreds of publicans in Sydney, and
just about two or throe of them are in athletic
health —and this because they are strong enough
to steadily resist all invitations to drink, thus
rising superior to the weaknesses of their cus-
tomers. The Bulletin has a sincere regard for
Beach, and hopes to see him shoeing horses and
not stoking men with rum. The latter business
he can safely leave to those “ patriotic ” bosses of
whisky-mills who barnacle themselves on to every
shining light of aquatics. If, as has been pro-
posed, Beach is given a start in a big farriery
establishment in Sydney, he will in all probability
make a little fortune—even if he should prove to
be only half as good a farrier as he Is an oarsman.
* * *
If Beach is really the weight they credit
him with, 14 stone and a half, he will do well to
retire from active service, for to a man of his age
the work necessary for the reduction of 281bs. will
become every day more severe. When Tom
Cribb, of immortal memory, fought and defeated
the American black Molineux, Tom scaled 14st.
31b. He then led rather a merry life for some six
months, and when a second match was arranged
with Molineux Tom weighed something over 16st.
Captain Barclay took Cribb away to his estate in
Scotland, where Tom underwent his preparation,
and, stepping into the ring at 13st. 61b , Tom
polished off the black in workmanlike fashion.
Cribb at the time was 30 years of age—an age, by
the way, at which a man was supposed to he get-
ting past championship form in the good old days
of the P.R. —hut he afterwards said he would
rather fight a couple of battles than go through
that preparation again. Captain Barclay, always
in athletic training, and looked upon as second to
none in England with the mittens, amateur or
professional, used to hex Tom up a constitution
hi}l on h : s ground, and Cribb told the yarn after-
wards that this was, the hardest part of his train-
ing at the commencement, for his cries of “ bellows
to mend” would have no effect on the Captain,
who would continue to belt him unmercifully un-
til the top of the hill was reached.

All Sydney and its wife and its mother-in-
law turned out last week to welcome William
Beach on his arrival from England, and there
was excitement enough for a revolution. The
whole city seemed to bo flying the champion’s
colours, and a few enthusiastic individuals even
dressed themselves from head to foot in nigger
and jaundice tints. The harbour was covered
with boats, and though there was perhaps room
enough on the Quay to swing a cat, the process
would have been fatal to tho feline, for goodness
only know how many people were crowded there
—some say 10®.000, but wo don't believe it. Six
drags awaited the champion’s party, and when
Beach landed amid a whole city full of uproar,
the police had to take him in custody and convey
him to his vehicle, or he would certainly have
been squashed. Even as it- was, he was cor-
dially spanked on tho back till lie had no
wind left. The procession then made for
the Colonial Secretary’s Office, where the
Awful (short for the Awful Majesty of the Queen’s
representative) congratulated the successful
sculler, who grunted once or twice in response,
and thence the show struggled along to the Town
Hall. Here Jubilee Young had what will proba-
bly be his last slice of luck ; in his capacity as
municipal boss he made the first speech, and after
him came tho ex-hero, Plain Bill, and Sir Patrick
Jennings. Beach then upheaved himself and
responded, and the official aspect of the outburst
was at an end.

Jackson’s big ’un, Kiley, did not show up

took to knock Nolan out in six rounds, but, big as
he is, Kiley does not appear able to hit hard enough
to knock a hole in the .proverbial pound of butter,
and Nolan was all there when time was called.
Gorman and Smith, the lad who recently fought
M’Carthy, had four ding-dong rounds, there being
nothing to choose between the pair at the finish.
Fitzsimmons and Molloy had a light quick, set-to,

favour of Fuller. Hansen persauded Murray to

resolution that for the future only three-year-olds
should be allowed to enter.

The Melbourne Leader waxes wroth
over the proposed sailing of Sir W. J. Clarke’s
yacht, the Janet, against the Magic and Waitangi
in the one race, and there is a deal of truth in the
arguments brought forward. No truer yachtsmen
than the owners of the Magic and Waitangi can
the yachting world boast, but should either bout
get the Janet under her lee it is not human nature
that the skipper to windward will allow her to get
away so long as he can keep her there, and in the
meantime the third boat may be booming along
miles away. The Janet, of course, might have the
luck to be the yacht to get clear off, and leave
the Sydneyites to blanketing operations, but, in
any case, if it is to be for the “championship,”
would it not bo better for the Magic and Waitangi
to sail beforehand and the winner meet the

the battle from afar, and ho is now matched
against Tom Cannon in the Greece-Roman style
for £lOO, the contest to come off in three weeks’

approach to the gentle sport the Yankees term a
“ canine controversy” that we know of, and we
do not think it will ever become popular in Aus-
tralia. A meeting bet ween the rival “ pro-
fessors,” Miller and Jackson, with the mittens,
would draw more “ gate” than the whole series
of wrestling matches.

The thoroughbred dies hard. Frank
Skurry Hewitt, rising 43, offers to run anyone in
the world, 40 years of age, five distances from 100
yards to a quarter, for £5OO aside. We fancy, by
the way, Frank Skurry was the first to have a
flutter with Malone in Sydney. Amongst a sport-
ing crowd, one evening, a then unknown young
gentlemen, from whose tongue the brogue ran as
water from a duck’s back, ventured the opinion
that he thought he could run 75 yards purty fasht.
Frank Hewitt was of a different opinion, and it
was not until Malone had beaten him for a small
stake that Hewitt was satisfied.

Business is very lively in the Melbourne
muscle market. Tom Cannon is to wrestle Miller
for the “ World's Championship,” Grsoco Roman,
one-down-on - his-hsuids-and-knees-and-the-other-
one-sitting-on-his-back fashion. Jack Connor,
who vanquished the veteran Christol, is waiting
to have a go at the winner. Donald Dinnie Is
about to shake the dew drops from his mane, and
wrestle more “ draws,” in every imaginable style.
And tho mighty Sali has just arrived from Italy,
prepared to throw Miller with one arm, while he
licks Diunie at weight-lifting with the other. Wo

match will be followed by a grand complimentary

It is to be hoped that the boss gladiator won’t

The Sydney Mail publishes as a Christ-
mas supplement a portrait of Baby Beach in a
dirty frock seated on a log as he appeared years
[ before he owned any sculls except the one on
which his frowsy hair was rooted. There are also
nine portraits of eminent Australian rowers, but
somehow they look painfully like those of the nine
who were convicted of the Mount Rennie out-
rage.

He was a philosophical and venerable old
gentleman with a decided thirst for information,
and as he strolled towards the crowd on the Cir-
cular Quay he innocently inquired, “ What are
you wailing for?” “For Beach.” “Who’s
Beach?” When they had finished with him
his hr-ad was stowed away in his left armpit, and
his right ear was wedged down into the toe of his
left boot, The doctois think that what remains

There was a ginger-headed youth in
Sydney who was studying for the Ministry, and
who looked as if a little horse-whipping would do
him good. He boarded with his mother, and held
himself up by his mean, lank, red hair for the
admiration of a pretty girl who had long been
‘ devoted to him and who thought him a hero.
' He was too poor to get married, he said, and the
girl is poor also, but she managed to save £1 out
of her scanty earnings and invested it In a sweep,
hoping against hope that something might turn
up to begin house-keeping on. Something did
: turn up, and in a pe-fect flutter of delight she put
j £4OO into the hunts of the inci, t- nt Wble-whacker
and told him that all difficulties were now
smoothed away. And so they were next morning,
for the chunk of pious cold veal had departed,
and on top of the brush with which he was accus-
tomed to grind up his sacred scalp was a note
saying that as money won by gambling never
brought a blessing, he had gone off to expend it in
charity. He added that the church was his bride,
and we can only hope that when he marries her
the bride vs ill habitually plant her cold ecclesias-
tical feet in the small of his back at midnight and
make him sit up with a snort. Almost thou per-
suadest me to join the Y.M.C.A.

The Sydney Echo says : “ Our country
cousins would be surprised to learn that out of the
crowds of horses that run at suburban meetings
near Sydney very few are started to win.” Ho,
ho ! let the Echo man take a horse up the country
and try to teach “our country cousins” a little
wrinkle in the way of in-and-out running. Man !
he’d find half of them knew enough to skin him.
Country cousins, indeed!

The A.J.O. Summer Meeting.
For the A. J.C. Summer Cup, to be run on Boxing
Day, the Caulfield Cup hero, Ben Bolt, is at the head
of the poll on paper, but wo fear he will occupy a
more humble position when the liualnumbersappcftr
on the black board. The trainer of the horse, Mr.
Kelly, was in Sydney a few days ago, which
favours the probability of the horse starting. On
her Melbourne running, Industry possesses not
the remotest show, hut it is no secret that she was
all to pieces when down South. Mr. White holds
three nominations up to date—at the head whereof
is Volcano, who somewhat coincidenlly occu-
pies third position now in the handicap. At
first sight Bst. olbs. appears an immensity of
weight for a three year old running amongst older
horses, with lighter imposts. But Volcano’s
late two-year-old running and subsequent per-
formances as a three-year-old, both, at Randwick
and Flcmington, fully entitle him to every ounce
of his burden. Let it bo assumed, too, just for
argument’s sake, that the Summer Cup is a Derby-
race in which, of course, all the male competitors
would carry Bst, 101 b., and the marcs Bst. 61b.
apiece ; how many are there out of the lot that
would be able to pace half a mile with Volcano ?
The gi eat difference in the weights may bring him
back to some of them, and If the betting market be
any guide there is a prospect of Volcano being a
defer ter on the day, and the success, or otherwise,
of the blue and white being left to the care of Hex-
ham and Tamarisk. This item comes under the head
of probabilities, which are at present difficult to
solve—very likely, at this date, the stable have
not the price of a sandwich on any of their in-
tended representatives, if, indeed, they have
decided which is the Simon Pure of the trio. But
judging fjom appearances, and the maniacal
rush made after Mr. White’s nominations, two
courses only are open to Mr. W. : he either has to
accept 2 to 1 about his nags when he should at least
obtain 10 to 1, or start them unbacked for the
benefit of what is known as “ the long-suffering
public.” At present we incline strongly to the
chances of Volcano, Tom Brown, Pilot, Highland
Mary, Leichhardt, and Upper Cut, with an un-
limited amount of confidence in the first-named,
if, on the day, he should carry his master's money.
As a second string, Pilot is, perhaps, the most
reliable.
* * *
The excellent acceptances made for Tattersall’s
Club Cup and Carington Stakes, together with
the numerous entries received for the minor
events to be decided at the two days’ race meeting
which commences at Randwick on New Year’s
Day under the auspices of Tatteroall’a Club, gives
promise of being the very best on record since
Secretary Perry has been in command of this
nourishing institution. With over 35 horses still
left in Tattersall's Club Cup, and just about 40 in
the Catington Stakes, backers have a merry task
set them of spotting tie winning double, although
the business will be somewhat minimised by the
running for the S mmer Cup, which takes place a
week in advance of Tattersall’s meeting. In the
first-named event Arsenal’s name appears whore
it did the last time he ran in public—at the head
of (he rest engaged in the contest —but whether
he is equal to repeating the performance with an
additional 221 b. on his back has yet to bo proven.
The Melbourne Sportsman makes the cunning
assertion that Mr. Scarr evidently thought
Arsenal won the Mel bourne Cup “ with a lot up
his sleeve,” simply because he has risen him a
stone and eight pounds for the Randwick event.
If Vigilant’s brilliant idea be correct, it is beyond
doubt that the Hon. James White must have had
both his sleeves stuffed, as little Hexham, who
was what Harrio Smith, of Victoria, would call
donkey-licked, with Cat. 51b., is risen to 7st. 41b.
for Tattersall's Cup. The Jewel is none too well
treated with Sst. 101 b . and Dunlop has too strong
a mortgage on any Victorian event he may
** spiel ” for to risk a visit to Sydney at present.
Should ho, however, be amongst the starters and
goers for tins race, two-thirds of these at present
left in (whose owners and trainers are beguiling
themselves with a belief that they have a Hen on
the 500 sovs. and Gold Cup) might just as well
remain in their loose-boxes for all the possible
chance of success they each and all possess.
Ben Bolt has only a squeak with Bst. 81b., and
will be more at home in the Summer Cup should
he visit the scene of his former triumphs. Ring-
master’s name appears amongst the list of con-
tented ones, but the writer’s dollars will not be
lost on him. Silver King is remarkably well
treated with 7st 6187? and shall carry our coin
when the stable are on themselves. Hexham and
Pilot are both on the same mark, and of (ho pair
we prefer the latter. Then comes the untried one,
The Felon, a full brother to First Demon. We,
however, prefer performers, of
rumours that 3min. 3lsec. will have to be broken
'to beat him. Lower down the list appear the
names of horses who have not a million to one
show of winning, albeit they all help to keep up a
field. We have a nevor-dyirg fondness for the
gentler sex, which extends even to horse-flesh. The
present is no exception to the rule, and despite all
warnings w r e shall roly on Tamarisk, Highland
Mary, and Sorelia to champion us, notifying
oven so early our preference for the first-named ;
and fora “saver,” wo choose as a Pilot nothing
loss than a Silver King or Myall King.

The Carington Stakes, with its 41 acceptors, will
be a nice little race for punters who have “ gone
wrong ” on the Summer Cup and Tattersall’s Cup,
to “ get right.” Benefited as they will be by wit-
nessing the rheumatic competitors in the two
above-named events, it may he comparatively easy
to make a recovery on this particular contest, for
we are loyal enough to prophesy that not any
of our racing men would insult Baron Carington
by running a horse “ watered ” in an event named
after him. Were we compelled to select three or
four at the present time we should ask for an
Upper Cut of Blue Blood from Highland Mary,
with the toast of Here’s Luck to Volcano and
Gozo as a fall hack.

rcpljing to the congratulations of Mr. Want, on

“ He need not say that Mr, Salomons, when to their Breal
regret he resigned the position to which it was his honouraui
amnition to attain, and for which he was so well fitted, wm

Mr, Justice Windeyer’s nose hero turned nP
visibly. It is pretty generally known that when
Mr, Darley waited upon Judge Windeyer to ex-
postulate with the latter in regard to his attitude
towards Mr. Salomons, some rather strong wolds
passed between them, and as a result their social
relations are now considerably iced.

We would like to write nice things always
if the theatres would permit us to do so ; it is so
much pleasanter to write Herald copy than
to write the stern sad truth ; nicer to speak of a
performance “ as a clearly-cut embodiment of the
part,” “ a histrionic triumph of the highest
Order, than to depart from the example of
Ananias, letter-writing judges, and land-agents, in
order to exhibit truth without the conventional
bustle and paint. It is pleasanter in tho result,
too. for while daily paper critics walk into the

Of “Jim the Penman,” at Sydney Opera
Home, it would be untruthful to say anything much
that was not pleasant. It is built on fine lines, and
possesses immense engine-power of dramatic
force. Different from tho flood of alleged come-
dies which have lately inundated Australia, and
which were so called because they were like
nothing else in this world or tho next—unless, per-
haps, in a lower one—and not much like comedies
at that —Sir Charles Young's masterpiece is fun 0 f
humour, mainly of a satirical kind, which diverts,
and dramatic action which entrances, the mind.
And there is strong originality in almost every
scene and situation, not less than with the
characters themselves. Jim tho Penman is a very
refined young man with a decided talent for copy-
ing signatures. He shows to perfection what a
really first-class forger is capable of doing when In.
full work. Tho manipulation of orders for £140,000
is not beyond his abilities, and tho copying of a
prescription not beneath them. The weak link in
the drama is his openly forging his wife’s name to
a cheque while in a room full of his guests. Baron
Hartfeld, his accomplice, in an artistic contrast
the piece abounds with such contrasts—to Jim ;
unscrupulous, designing, cynical, and cold-blooded,
ho seems to have been made for tho sole purpose
of devastating a credulous and opnlent universe,
while Captain Redwood appears to have been
built for the express purpose of ultimately making
the Baron sit up in a rigid and painful manner.
Hedwood is not like the hoary presentment of a
stage detective who wears scarlet whiskers, speaks
with a County Cork brogue, and hides in hollow
togs i his business is perfect save when the author
with a temporary aberration of skill, makes him,
while in the house of tho culprits be is tracking,
blather out all his suspicions and intentions, in a
voice compared with which the resonant tones of
Dawvld Buchanan eulogising a horse-thief to a
Mudgoe jury, are but as the love-whisper in the
back garden of a house wherein resides a stern
Parient who takes nineteen in pegged bluchers.
Ihe quartette of female women are nicely chosen,
and comprise tho four most conspicuous types of
society’s adornments. And their dresses, we are
credibly informed, are “ o-o-o-h lovely.”
* * *
It is not possible to give unadulterated
praise to Mr. St. Maur for his version of “ Jim the
enman.” His face responded admirably to every
demand of tho text, but his hands were in con-
irrual rebellion. Their method of expressing deep
emotion was to waggle as though he were shaking
«- charge of duck-shot out of a small boy, and
. action was in ludicrous contrast to the agita-
lon of his eyes and facial muscles. This defect
apart, his performance went more ounces to
ne pound than anything we have ever seen him
o, and that, wo would modestly point out, is as
much as most men can ever expect in a lifetime
Muv ln 80 ceusorious a world as this. Mr.

picnic at Fontainebleau, where a dozen butterflies
are humming round a fashionable siren. One of
the party, a limp, loosely-built swell with an in-
flamed and blotchy grin, makes an original re-
mark ; it is “Ah! yes—ah—ha— yaw-yaw—
yaw yah oh ah-yes—thank yaw—yaw--yah.”
A journalist of groat waist diameter is the most
prominent figure in the party, and he is presently
joined by a young sculptor with a strident, boom-
ing laugh ; this artist lives witli his mother.
* *
Ah might be expected, the sculptor falls in
love with the siren, and even while he is pounding
bricks in his studio her image haunts him. It is

fail in love with an orphan who has just come

sold like a superannuated fowl by the lady of his
choice, and sinks down a mere limp crushed
trodden-on remnant of a maudlin ass’inadress
suit, with hardly pluck and energy enough left to
drag about the load of his own boots. He hangs
round piteously, now sitting with his legs doubled
up and his head on the table, now dropping on a
sofa with his feet expanded and his wretched
grovelling skull hanging anyhow, while the lady
heaps scorn upon him in the hope that he may at
last find enough leg bone to carry him back to his
mother and leave her in peace. And ultimately
even this miserable parody on a man rouses a
little; ho laughs—a mad laugh, and saying
with an abject groan that he doesn’t oare he
starts for home. Ho finds on his arrival there
that his mother is dead, and then he does the only
sensible act of his life—he rolls over with his old
familiar yelp and dies in a dishevelled heap.

Raphael Duchatelet is described in the
bill of lading as “ a young sculptor,” and Mr.
Sheridan somehow did not seem to answer tliii
description. In the prologue the same gentleman
took the part off Phidias, and looked the character
well, but as Raphael he got himself up with a
worn, heavy, haggard aspect that put the sculptor
at a discount from the very first. Moreover, the
dreary, monotonous deliverance which suited’ the
part of Louis XI. so admirably, was woefully out
of place, and thanks chiefly to it the ardent young
lover became a solid block of drivel and stupidity.
Miss Davenport made only a moderate success as
Maroo. Her acting as the heartless coquette was
at times excellent, but she engaged in a gallant
struggle with her own features at those moments
when a play of expression was wanted, and she
lost the skirmish every time. If she had contented
herself with acting and abolished expression
altogether wo are inclined to think the re-
sult would have been admirable. The other
members of the company pounded along in a bus!
ness-like fashion though rather heavily, and the
three living statues—Aspasia, Lais, and Phrvne—
were really excellent.

Mr. Locke Richardson, who carries the
works of Shakespeare about with him in his head
is doing grand business round Melbourne. He
favours town halls, and such like orthodox places
of resort. Pillars of sassiety who would rather
die than enter the polluted precincts of a “ theay-
ter.” prefer the American reciter to church socials
and find a four-shilling seat better value for their
money than a collection. Every now and then
Lady Loch expresses a “desire” for some special
play, and on these occasions a well shirt-fronted
and bore-shouldered mob pack the Town Hall
like sardines in a box. But Mr. Richardson is
something more than a fashionable entertainer.
Ho is able to give life to Shakespeare’s characters,
and moulds his subjects into neat narrative shape.
Memory scarcely ever fails him, or, if it does, ho
pops in a word with the easy assurance of a con-
jurer. Talking of conjurers, Dr. Lynn can do a
httio in the Immortal Bard line. The Doctor has
Hamlet off by heart.

A correspondent of a certain Australian
paper, who was sent to the New Hebrides some
time ago, has been going about enveloped in a
cloud of gloom you could cut with a knife ever
since he returned. Once he was the leading spirit
of a convivial circle of journalists; now —alas,
now ! —whenever he makes his appearance he is
like the skeleton at the Egyptian feast, the bailiff
at a family party. One by one the depressed
scribes got up and walk droopingly away till
he is left alone. Thus we found him on one occa-
sion lately, and the look of hopeless misery he cast
upon us made us ask him what his trouble was.
After some hesitation he consented to tell us.
“ It was in the island of ” (we forget its name
now) he began, mournfully emptying his pewter,
“ where the event occurred which cast a pall over
my destiny, and made my existence no better than
a prolonged undertakers’ picnic, I was staying
there for some days gathering material for descrip-
tive articles. The natives were very kind to 'me.
I had a native servant—an old woman—who used
to cook forme. She used to make up all kinds of
delicate little dishes. She was very fond of me.
I asked her why, once, and. she told me that I re-
minded her of a son she had lost. One day she
brought me something cooked in a piece of bamboo.
I asked her what it was. She laughed and said,
‘ No mind—you eat um —good.’ Then she split
the bamboo and emptied the contents into a tin
plate. I tasted the food —it was delicious. I never
stopped till I had finished the lot. ‘ You like um ? ’
she said, laughing again. ‘ Ha ! Ha ! Gettum
plenty more.’ I asked her again what it was.
‘ Piece small fellow boy,’ she answered, grinning
demoniacally. ‘ Good Heaven ! ’ I shrieked, ‘ then
I am a cannibal. 1 I remembered no more, but when
the schooner called for me the captain told me he
found me trying to cure myself with salt
water, and said the natives told him I had been
doing this for several days. I may have brought
up that piece of boy or not, but whether or no, I
knew I was a cannibal all the same, and the hor-
rible part of it,” he concluded in a shuddering
whisper, “is that I have hungered for human
flesh ever since. That’s why they all avoid me as
you see.” He rose up and went into the next
room to call for more liquor, and—we left by the
back way.

Extract from Duncan Gillies’ guileless and
ungrammatical epistle to Sir Pat. :
11 For fiome little time I hare thought that your younger
sister Victoria might be able to aid you materially in your
effort to make your centennial commemoration worthy of
the occasion We propose to take advantage of
it, and when all your fetes are over—when your brilliant de-
monstrations in Sydney are brought to a close, your younger
sister will invite your visitors to come and see the Australian
world’s fair at our exhibition.”
I, we, your younger sister ! Now, by the shade of
Lindley Murray, what does the man mean ? Is
the exhibition his, theirs, or her’s 2 Sir Pat. hopes
to be in a position to reply in the course of a few
days. Heaven help him in his task. Will he
address the letter to Duncan, to them, or to his
blessed sister I Or will—but this is madness.
Oh, Duncan G., you seem to be
Of words a crazy twister—
The I and we they don’t agree
At all with Younger Sister ;
For, can’t you see, if We and She
Are merely Duncan Gil-lies,
Then She is He and you are three
And all a muddle still is.
Henry Ward Beecher has been rubbing
some of the English parsons the wrong way on
the all-important “hell” question. His farewell
sermon at the London City Temple was attended
by some 2000 ministers and aspirants for holy
orders. Yet, in the presence of such a sulphurous
multitude, Beecher let go after this fashion : “If
a man believes in conscious torment of men in
hell, then if he ever smiles, or gets married, or
goes into convivial company with jest and joke,
he is a monster. (Sensation.) In regard to the
doctrine as taught by the barbaric theologians of
the middle ages, and as taught by the barbaric
denominations of to-day—it is not according to the
mind and will of the New Testament.” (Tumult.)
Then did the blood of the dissenters boil in their
redeemed veins as they rose and cried, “It is
Biblical truth /” Yes, dear friends, and hell is
Biblical truth to which we intend to hang on like
a bull-pub to a beggar’s leg. We like Beecher,
and think he means well, but we can’t part with
our doctrine. We have been threatened with
everlasting fire for so many years that it has lost
its terrors, and we have begun to like the pros-
pect. Gently strike the gridiron with a red-hot
poker, while we admonish Henry Ward B. :
There is to be a Bible-burning episode in
Melbourne. The National Publishing Company of
N.S.W. have been exporting the Scriptures to
| that colony, but as their sacred volume contains
the Revised Version, as well as that old one
with the piteous, smudgy grovel to King James
on the title-page, the consignment has been seized.
This is rough on rats, indeed. The Revised
Scripture, with perdition struck out and the lake
I of fire drained off and converted into a demoniac
j tennis-ground, proves to be the property, by copy-
right, of the Universities of Oxford and Cam-
bridge ; they alone have the right to issue the
i true story of Jonah and his revised whale, and
people who don’t buy from them will have to be
content with the old, mean, vulgar whale of the
I dark ages. The two colleges get a per-centage
out of Moses and Goliah and Ananias ; they charge
commission on Job and his boils, and exhibit the
old patriarch for the sake of the gate-money, like
a spotted hyena in a show ; and they hire out the
Israelites as if they were so many kanakas on a
Queensland plantation. It would be difficult to
imagine a grosser outrage than this, and the only
redeeming feature in the whole miserable affair is
that the new version is not wanted in Australia.
What is required for this country is a Bible with
250 perditions, each keeping up a temperature of
a billion degrees Fahrenheit, and in which eter-
nity is made twice as long as it was before, so that
the larrikin may have time to howl for a good
long spell in each.

A grievous wrong which is habitually per-
petrated on the white Australian in gaol has been
brought under our notice by Mr. Frederick Hay,
an ancient and spectacled gentleman who did us
the honour of visiting this office the other morn-
ing. Mr. Hay’s face illustrates the insult of which
he complains, for he has only a slight foam of
whisker round the shores of his countenance, and
his hair is cut very short. The hair, we may add,
has a tint of red, a peculiarity which, we imagine,
is redheaditary in the family. One night some
months ago Mr. Hay had “ about six drinks,” and
took a beer home in a bucket for his wife. That
lady swigged it off, and then her lord and master
gave her all his income except 9d., and went out
for another drink and a plug of tobacco. He had
the drink, and was going along thinking of things
in general, when he was “scruffed and run in ; ”
the charge was “drunk and disorderly, yer wor-
ship, and used bad language to a hossifer while
executin’ his dooty,” and in default of a fine Mr.
Hay went up for three months. He was then
handed over to the gaol-barber, who chopped
down his hair, scraped away the boundary
line which separated the desert of his jaw
from the wildnerne-s of his neck, and turned
him out into the exercise-yard where he was
laughed at by niggers and Chinamen who were
not cropped and shaved. Mr. Hay would have
called earlier to draw our attention to this dis-
crepancy ; but he goes to gaol regularly twice a
year for not sending his children to school, and he
had a little episode of this kind to work off on the
expiry of his three months. He arrived, how-
ever, last Monday, and a member of our staff
being told off to interview him—a man who is
kept in reserve for these jobs because he can look
so like a born fool; it comes natural to him to do
so—we learnt what he wanted to know. Mr. Hay
had a big bale of literature about him which he
had written to show how N.S.W. lands could be
sold all round at £5O an acre ; he said he had
shown this document to Parkes and Parkes had
said that he would have pushed the scheme
through if he had been 20 years younger, but life
was too short now, and the inventor was just
going to pay Sirenry another visit when he was
run in.
* * *
That irrepressible agnostic, Joseph Symes,
was sold the other day as effectually as ever cow
was sold by bailiff. He was delivering one of his fiery
lectures, and was in even better fighting condition
than usual—and Joseph at his worst is a whole
wild-beast-show at fighting. “ Let’s see this God
of yours,” screeched the lecturer, as he struck out
manfully with his best leg ; “ bring out this God,
I’ll give £5 to any man who’ll come along and
prove that he knows this God,” he continued with
a yelp like a lost soul with a cold, and then for
about half an hour he turned the grindstone of
wrath and whooped for someone to bring out a
deity to be smashed. When he had nearly
finished, a small, thin, meek-looking man with a
doubled-up aspect and a racecourse on top of his
mild little head, crawled up on the platform and
sniffed apologetically, while the great Jos. sized
him up and sniffed also with a whole whale-load
of derision. “ My friends,” piped the placid little
man solemnly in a voice like that of a croupy hen,
“ Mr. Symes has said he will give £5 to any man
who can prove that he knows God. Now, about
12 years ago I went to a lecture in a Wesleyan
chapel in a small manufacturing town in Lan-
cashire, and I heard a young man declaring that
he had found the Lord, and he poured forth a
stream of eloquence as he described how he know
he was saved and what happiness he experienced.
My friends, that young man was Mr. Joseph
Symes. He knew the Lord then, and as he don’t
know him now, I presume that the Lord wasn’t
proud of his acquaintance and cut him dead. I
don’t know how Mr. Symes is to arrange about
that bet, but I think he’d better spend the money
in charity.” Then the small man gave a wheeze
and a groan and sat down.

The Pall Mall Gazette recently pub-
lished some interesting particulars about “The
Cycle as a War Steed.” According to all accounts
the tricycle is specially adapted to this business
and promises to knock the balloon quite out of
time. The P.M.G. says : “ Two of the great Con-
tinental Powers (Austria and France) have thus
practically shown that they recognise in the cycle
an invention capable of adding to the methods of
modern warfare, and with cycling making great
progress in Germany, it may safely be affirmed
that the time is near at hand when these machines
will be on military trial in the Fatherland.” Eng-
land will follow suit, and the war telegram of the
near future will tell how “ General Jones behaved
with great gallantry, having three triycles shot
from under him. The army is now busily repair-
ing the wounded machines.” —
Whenever anybody in Sydney wants to
play a practical joke, he chooses that venerable
nonagenarian Mr. Samuel Levey of the Oxford
Hotel as his victim, knowing that that gentle-
man’s vast panorama of brain will cause it to be
found out before it goes too far. Accordingly
when Mr, Levey got a letter the other day,
written on Government House paper, bearing the
official stamp, and signed “E. W. Wallington,”
as secretary to H. E. Lord Carington, in which he
was requested to consult with His Excellency on
the reform of the N.S.W. civil service, he did not
shine his boots and proceed at once to hunt up
Lord Carington ; he showed the document instead
to Colonial Secretary Dibbs, and as that gentle-
man thought it was a sham and handed the
forgery over to the police, Mr. Levey hived up his
buzzing store of knowledge till a better occasion.
In this respect he was more fortunate than an in-
telligent firm in Dunedin (N.Z.). Years ago a
legend on a one-storey wooden shop in Hanover-
street explained that Messrs. “ Rice, Hatton and
Rice, Wholesale Confectioners,” were crowded up
within,, and one day, when Lord Normanby visited
the town, the boss of the hut received a letter
setting forth that the Governor was coming down
to witness the process of boiling lollies and making
toffee out of the contents of the sugar-bucket. “ I
may mention,” said the writer in conclusion
“ that his Excellency is particularly fond of Turk-
ish Delight. It is a madness that runs in the
gubernatorial family.” That day the premises
were scrubbed as white as snow, and enough
Turkish Delight was boiled to make a camel ill
in all its nine stomachs at once, but the governor
came not, and at last a little Hebrew barrister
was consulted by the enraged firm and his verdict
convinced them that they had swamped their
whole stock of sugar in one leathery confection,
and all in vain.
* * *
Field Flowers Goe, the new Bishop of
Melbourne, only accepted the billet because
“earnest prayer” convinced him that “this was
a call from God which he was not at liberty to
disobey.” The dear old story! Doubtless Mr.
Goe persuaded himself and the ladies of his Lon-
don congregation that his mission in Australia
was “ ordained.” To tell him that F. F. Goe sug-
gested and guided the Loard’s policy in this matter
would be to insult him. Yet, as a matter of fact-,
Mr. Goe can afford to speak the truth. He is a
fairly rich and liberal man, and has been in the
habit of devoting his yearly salary to the assist-
ance of struggling curates. He might well have
said that he had no money-making object in
entering the Church, but that, being in the Church
he was naturally open to become a Bishop, and
thereby make certain of a reserved seat in the
Kingdom. Instead of this he elected to follow
the old hypocritical custom, and defined the party
offer (Liberal or Conservative ministers respec-
tively arrange whom God shall elect) of a bishopric
as a Divine order. Pshaw! The Almighty
“called” some half-dozen men before Field
Flowers Goe, and all of them declined the job.

A writer in the Melbourne Herald,
i speaking of the condition of the morgue, says
“ Everything in the room for the dead is utterly
forlorn and depressing. This ig not as it should
be. If there is anything a corpse likes more than
another it is an appearance of cheerfulness about
any place he is staying in. He doesn’t want any-
thing rollicking or riotous, but he does enjoy quiet
and unostentatious fun. We should say, there-
fore, that if the morgue were fitted up with a
billiard and one or two card-tables, a smoking-
room, and a bar —especially a bar —with a few
sporting prints on the walls, it would be a popular
place of resort with the corpses of the near future.
There is no reason because a man happens to be
dead that you should make the world gloomy for
him.
General Booth has raised the required
£5OOO and the Harmy is saved. The contributors
were eager and enthusiastic, and many of them
dropped into poetry that sounded like a cross
between a curse and a lunatic asylum. One poor
beggar, for example, sent his last sixpence—and
the General was mean enough to take it—accom-
panied by the following ;
“ I never had any veal or ham,
A very little mutton or lamb,
I’ll do without my sugar and jam.
Or anything for ?
We always admire sincerity, and we reckon that
after all this that sad little ass will get the first
bite at the ham-bone in Heaven, and will pass it
on to the Archbishop of Canterbury when it is
picked bare.
Even in art, dry bones, skeletons, and
slaughter are growing fashionable. The coming
artist of Europe is a great genius. Jan Van
Beers, a young Belgian, who, beginning with
wonderfully realistic pictures of beautiful nudity,
sprang into greatness by producing a picture re-
presenting the patriot, Van Arte veldt, lying
bound with ropes, dead, rotting, and mutilated
after his murder by the Flemings. He also struck
oil by a picture of a corpse holding up its own
bleeding head, and he has made a great third suc-
cess by a work now being exhibited at Paris. It
is hung in a dark corner of a saloon, and repre-
sents a skeleton draped in white. As the visitor
goes up two hollow notes are struck on a gong,
there is a flash of green light, and then the
painted outrage bobs down by machinery, and
shows the visitor his or her face reflected in a
mirror held in its bony hand. At this stage of the
joke a lady generally faints, and has to be carried
i out.
Naughty Ward Beecher,
Unorthodox preacher,
To roh your poor brother of bliss ;
They have such a yearning
To see us all burning
In a sulphur and brimstone abyss.
Hot torture eternal
In regions infernal
Is what they apportion to us ;
They’re waiting and willing
To watch us a-grilling—
And you go on talking, sir, thus.
What use their salvation
If certain damnation
Is not to be our wretched lot !
Their spiritual pleasure
Consists, in a measure.
In thinking that we’ll get it hot.
Naughty Ward Beecher,
We humbly beseech yer
Scoff not at their cherished desire—
Preach torture eternal
In regions infernal,
And don’t try to put out Hell fire.
Once mail-clad knights fought fearful fights
With lances and with axes —
Those barons bold in days of old
(Who never paid no taxes),
Did daring deeds on armoured steeds
Substantial sort of cattle ;
But customs change, now men arrange
Another plan of battle.
When helm and shield on bloody field
Gave place to something lighter,
And bayonets keen came on the scene,
And bullets smote the smiter —
Knights still, of course, preferred a horse
Wherewith to do their charging ;
On those ideas, it now appears,
We really are enlarging.
Next time we go to fight the foe
And decimate their forces,
We’ll go on wheels and show our heels
To everything like horses.
With sword in hand, .you understand,
O’er bodies dead and gory
Our knights will ride in all their pride
On tricycles to glory.
HOW TO CATCH AN ALLIGATOR.
The sportsman is here seen starting in quest of alliga-
tors, armed with a gun, a dog, a concertina, and a mind
conscious of rectitude. The use of the concertina will
appear later on.
Having discovered indubitable “signs” of alli-
gator near the brink of a river
He ties the dog to a neighboring tree and plays a sonata
upon the concertina—not so much to beguile the time as to
make the dog howl and thus attract alligators.

The vignerons of Sandhurst (Tie.) —cheer-
ful growers of the gladdening grape—are in
spasms of terror just now. Some 3-ears ago the
vine3-ards of Geelong were destroyed in the evic-
tion of that genial insect the phylloxera. Ever
since then the wine-growers of that district have
been moving heave a and earth, and the Vic
torian Government, to obtain permission to re
plant their vineyards; and the wine-growers o '
Sandhurst ha3"e been using all their influence in
the same quarters to prevent the permission being
granted. Maddened at this, the Geelong vignerons
have threatened to bring up millions of the phyl-
loxera without muzz’es, and let them loose over
every vine3'ard within 50 miles of Bendigo, unless
the opposition is withdrawn, Since the expres-
sion of this threat every man within the radius
mentioned who has an old grape vine growing
over his fowl-house has been sitting up all night
watching it, with a loaded shot-gun lying across
his knee, and a glare of incipient murder in his
eyes. The most fearful part of -the thing is its
mystery. Nobody around Sandhurst knows what
a phylloxera is like. We hear—though we do not
put implicit confidence in the statement, as we
got it man on the staff of one of the opposi-
tion papers—that a Melbourne reporter, who had
gone up to Sandhurst to describe the Juvenile and
Industrial Exhibition held there lately, was ar-
rested on suspicion of being a phylloxera in dis-
guise, Perhaps the havoc he made ajnong the
wines at the exhibition may have given rise lo the
suspicion. Ri t there is nothing to prove that he
did. make any particular havoc among them. The
whole story—about the reporter—is probably no
more than a malicious canard. It seems that the
phylloxera is, in appearance, something like
lobster, only it has wings. It belongs to the bu
rowing class of animals, and is perhaps the on
living thing (with the exception of the Queen
land country editor) which is never sober. It is

A romance of the sea. About a year
since, a young lady of Dunedin (N.Z.)got married
t ,°, ( a , y ° uLh (' l] 1 hitchman named Hoogklimmer.
After the Hoogklimmer honeymoon the couple
went to Melbourne and started love in a cottage
Ac. the husband had a situation as bookkeeper’
and all went well for some weeks until one morn-
ing Hoogklimmer got up very early to go sea-
bathing, and did not return. His clothed wore
found on the bench, and he was believed to have
been drowned. His young wife went into mourn-
ing for him, and after all attempts to find any
trace of him had failed she left Melbourne and
vent back to her friends in Dunedin. After a
years widowhood, however, Mrs. Hoogklimmer
got a telegram stating (hat her husband was alive
at his mothers house in Holland. Various ac-
counts are current as to how he got there, but the
rue Bulletin version is this. Being an excel-
lent swimmer, Hoogklimmer started to race a
N.E. steamer to the. Heads. When he got to the
Uip he was half a mile a winner, and our corre-
spondent who was on board the steamer states
that he then saw a white figure shoot up into the
air and (hen go down again head foremost into
(he boiling surf. That we may take for granted
w’ns the last glimmer of Hoogklimmer on this side
of the globe. From European papers now to hand
it appears that he was found a few days after-
wards boating on a piece of timber, more dead
ban alive, on the coast of Norway just outside
(he Maelstrom. If this be true, then there is
little doubt that Mr. Hoogklimmer has made a
discovery which will revolutionise the present
system of navigation and render De Leseeps’
Panama Canal a useless and roundabout way o ‘
reaching the old country. Our theory is that th
young Dutchman was shot through the 8000 mile
or so of the earth’s diameter by some passag
hitherto unknown to the geographical authorities
In all probability this subterranean passage com
municatee with the Rip at one end and the Mae •
strom at the other. Bank officials and Sunday
school superintendents will be greatly interests
in this new route to foreign parts. Mr. Beatty
of Greymouth (N.Z.) also seems to have been or,
the same financial “ fake.” He got a tumour re
moved from his eye, and bought a pound of rice
for his mother, and then he vanished, like a quar
of rum inside a policeman. Nothing was left to
tell the tale except half a pound of rice scatterec
on a bridge, and a hat floating in a river, but jus ;
as the money was about to be paid over Mi.
Beatty turned up in Melbourne. He had got a
new hat and his eye was quite better.
The “Bohemian” of the Sydney Globe
seems to be wonderfully hard-up for useful facts.
His last article—“ Youth that Perishes and Age

too-too utterness about the morals of Sydney', and
this is the nearest approach to anything definite
in the lot: —
“ Some day a wild crime is perpetrated by one of there

The beauty of it all is that the article would
answer so many purposes. If it were King Milan,
for instance, who was tottering and swilling beer*
and the Servian troops who were hopping among
tobacco-juice, it would be the most luminous acl
count of the battle of Slivmtza th \t was ever
written.

Society
As usual, Lady Carington received a
number of visitors on Thursday, the 2nd inst., at
Government House, Sydney. Since it was found
out that persons could go unasked without run-
ning the risk of being thrown out of the back door
by Die boys in plush, Lady Carington’s circle of
friends has extended, so that she now knows some
quite nice people in the whisky and other lines.
Their presence removes ranch of the stiff reserve
that formerly characterised gatherings at the
vice-regal mansion. There is an easy geniality
about the movements of the company which is
very winning. They plunge for the tea and cake
so naturally and unreservedly, ardform a pleasing
contrast to the proud souls of former days, who
waited until it was brought to them. The action
of one pleasant gentleman, who slipped a shilling
into the splendid butler's hand and asked him for
something “ stiff,” was a deliciously delicate hint
to his fair hostess that tea and coffee were not the
liquids yearned for in plebeian circles ; while the
fine fellow who lit his time-honoured pipe beneath
the spreading pine tree in the park, set an example
to the cigarette-whiffing dude, which completely
crumpled up that outcome of society manufacture.
No doubt her ladyship was among the first to
admit the many advantages of permitting the
self-invited to remain and cast by their presence a
charm over what had hitherto been a somewhat
slow and formal ceremonial.

Poor naval officer ! It appears he came
to her and won .her to himself. She was fair and
very rich, while he was but a simple lieutenant.
Time sped, and it was arranged that the marriage
should take place in England. She went to
Europe and he was to follow when he had com-
pleted his period of service. After many months
he reached England and flew on the wings of the
Portsmouth express to London. To leap into a
“ growler ” and reach a grand hotel was the work
of a moment. He found her in, so was her papa,
so was her mamma. Up he flew with open arms,
when a kind of chill fell on him. “ r Did you not
get it ? ” asked mamma. “ Get what 2 ” “ Her
letter she wrote breaking it off ; the letter must
have crossed you at sea,” “The cause?” he
asked, “ Well, in Sydney, young man, we were
good enough for you, but it don’t appear that in
England we’re good enough for your folk”—and so
he lost that £50,000.

At the Beach reception, a certain surgeon,
equally well-known for his stalwart physical pro-
portions and his good nature, finding himself in
the crush, squared his elbows to save his chest
from being “stove in.” One of those elbows,
however, was forced by the weight of the surging
multitude against the chest of another and weaker
man, and presently the doctor heard something
crack. “Oh!” groaned the much-elbowed man.
“Crack!” again—and another rib wont. “lam
dying! get a doctor !” said the broken-ribbed man
faintly. “ Ah, yes,” remarked the surgeon, ex-
amining his patient after a lane had been cleared
through the crowd, “ I am the nearest doctor.”
And he took the poor fellow home with him.

We have heard a good deal about Rose-
bery that has endeared him to us. When here he
showed hardly any contempt for the colonies,
which was most forbearing on his part, as he was
the victim to more sycophantic slobber than falls
to the lot of most men. This made us love him,
but when our only Peeress baeks up our opinion
with a tale of unbounded audacity, we feel in-
clined to worship him next after Beach. Says the
lady:—
“ At Christchurch, Lord Rosebery was celebrated principally
fjr his habit of taking claret at breakfast instead of coffee or
tea. He was famous, too, in the football field, and on the
river. Yet of the gentler arts of courti r he was not alto-
gether innocent. Walking one dull day in the neighborhood
of Windsor he met the Queen, who recognised him, and
made a remark on the gloominess of tbe sky. ‘Madame,’
quoth Lord Rosebery, ‘ it is always fine where you are.’ The
Queen was so delighted that she mentioned Lord Rosebery
to herself as a possible recipient of a Princess's hand. It is
whispered that Lord Rosebery was aware of the compliment
the Queen designed to pay him, and did not appreciate it. It
is no secret that the revenues attached to the Earldom of
Rosebery are not great—not, indeed, as large as the wants of
a man of their present owner’s sporting and other proclivities
require. If, however, Lord Rosebery was a few thousands in
debt at tbe time of his marriage, so much the greater was the
luxury of possessing a wife with a few millions.”

When To Whiti, prophet, of New Zealand,
emerges from the jug of the tyrant, the chances
are that he will find his occupation gone. No
doubt he will return to his former haunts and
rear his long brown figure on end and bark as
before, but in his absence the Mormons have been
seeking converts among his dusky flock, and he is
likely to find himself at a discount. The glorious
prospect of having as many wives as they like has
proved too much for the copper-kettle-coloured
tribes, and they are thinking of starting en masse
for Salt Lake. The society at this Paradise, by
the bye, must he getting rather mixed now, for
any horsey, doggy savage who can howl “ Long
live Brother Brigham Young !” is made welcome,
and the uglier and greasier he is the more eagerly
he goes on the grab for wives. It must be rather
depressing to the now female convert, though,
when a saint, who used to live on grubs and rum,
becomes a suitor for her hand.

A poor little nobleman has just got into
trouble. He is the eldest son of a British peer, and
is a small, sallow, flat-chested individual with a
melancholy smile that seemed to come all the way
from his liver, and he fell in love with a sweet
little woman who had two small words to say and
only one small article of attire to wear, in a bur-
lesque. The young lady scorned him, however,
because hs was poor, and it was only when he
turned up in sudden affluence and began spending
about £lOO a week in entertaining his charmer
that she agreed to be civil to him. But when his
father, the haughty marquis, and his aristocratic
mother returned from a tour they didn’t smile to
any serious extent, for of all the peer’s wardrobe
nothirg remained but a two-year-old belltopper,
and the marchioness had absolutely nothing to
wear except a pair of stockings, 150 pawntickets,
and one earring. If they had remained away
only a month longer the house would probably
have been gutted, and nothing left except a
coronet and a poker.
The Marquis and Marchioness of Stafford,
with Viscount Tarbat, have been doing the Gipps-
land ranges. The distinguished tourists were
kind enough to approve of the Black Spur and
pronounced the ferns “ haw, splendid bai

Actresses will he interested to hear that
the old Marquis of Ailesbury has quietly popped
off in his 75th year. By his decease Dolly Tester,
ex-chorus lady at the London theatres, is entitled
to clap a coronet upon her snowy brow. She
married the disgusted old gentleman’s grandson
and heir, a while back. Dolly has not been pre-
sented at court, but she will make a “slap-up”
marchioness. The new Marquis used to masquer-
ade as a costermonger.

A Melbourne Baptist has written to the
Heraid, protesting against the encouragement
of religious dissipation at bazaars. He asks :
“ How can the Baptists of South Melbourne hold
up their principles as followers of the Lord to the
young people of the Sabbath-school after training
them for weeks to act as * Living Draughts ?’ ”
Without exactly approving of bazaars (for which
it is impossible to find any authority in Holy Writ)
we must say that “ Living Draughts” is rather an
improving game for the young. The little hoys
and girls can learn a grand lesson from it. In the
first place it teaches them always to act on the
square. It teaches them that a black is as good as
a white ori the human draught-hoard. It teaches
them to bo always ready for the worst—one being
taken while the other one is left. It teaches
them that the Living Draught who misses an op-
portunity gets “huffed.” Finally it teaches them
that by boldly removing all obstacles in one’s path,
or by sneaking quietly along in the side walks of

Away at Echuca (Vic.) a love-sick little,
lady, named Adelaide Pyser, has been telling fibs
about her age. She is young, is Adelaide, yet not
so young that she did not want to get married.
’Tis a disease which has been epidemic among the
darlings ever since Eve’s time, and Adelaide
merely frrlfllled her womanly mission by catching
on to it. So she told a fib to the registrar,represent-
ing herself to be not so much a chicken as she
looked. Somebody exposed the pious fraud, and
the young bride stands committed for trial. She
will probably he let off with a blessing from the
jury and a wedding present from the Judge, but
in the meantime pretty (our heart tells us she
must be a daisy) Mrs. Adelaide Pyser is a blush-
ing object of sympathy. To prosecute a lady for
making a false declaration about her age ! Oh-

The coming man is obviously a woman,
but the Referee thinks she must give up being a
woman if she wants to score a success. Speaking
of female doctors, “ Dagonet ” says : —
“ One of the first concessions that lady students must
make if they wish to compete with the male sex is to put
aside all idea of the cares of maternity. . . . Those
young women who are ready to forego one of the chief duties
of their sex may, in the course of a generation or two, study
the ‘jologies ’ with impunity.”
Yes, in the course of a generation or two. But if
they are to give up the “cares of maternity,”
where in the name of Dibbs and all his angels is
that generation or two to come from ? Are we to
give up babies and import Chinamen instead ?

A petition for the taxation of bachelors
has been presented to the French Chamber of
Deputies. It alleges that there are half a mi'-
and anyone in the direct line had been hurried,
then the job of producing Lady C. must have been
commenced all over again. But it is absurd to
dwell upon such painful possibilities. Enough
that we have our perfect woman, and that—again
quoting the sublime snohologist—“ we thank the
old world for sending amongst us such persons.”
In dealing with the physical, apart from the in.
ward spiritual portion of Lady Carington’s perfect
womanhood, the essayist is bold even to rashness.
He says that one of the outward visible signs of
perfection is a “small and finely-moulded person
—a compact and harmonious structure not in any
way pinched or rigged out with absurd paddings.”
We will accept that declaration with childlike
faith. But when he says that “ Apollo’s how is
perfectly formed in her firm, full, red lips,” we
must ask for a few minutes’ breathing-time.

Here is a picturesque-slab from “Dagouet”:—
“ The papers, in spite of the silly season, have been excel-
lent reading of late. There are some gems hidden away in
odd corners. Did you read that Zolaesque incident com-
pressed into a paragraph of the young married woman at
Bournemouth who was found dead drunk in the churchyard
by the side of her little child’s grave? She had a bunch of
lovely bowers in her hand, which she had brought to lay
upon the mound above her dead little one’s resting-place.
And there she lay with the flowers clasped in her hand, dead
drunk. She was hauled before a magistrate, and she confessed
that she had taken gin-and-water to fortify herself. Can
you have a grimmer or a weirder incident than this? Gin
and flowers, dead babies and drunken mothers, a child’s
grave and a tipsy woman dragged from it by the police.
There is nothing in the “Assoinmoir” that equals or ap-
proaches this story from beautiful B.urnemouth told in a
paragraph of four lints."

A Melbourne lady of doubtful antecedents
has been discarded by her husband because she
drives around in hansom cabs, and all that sort of
thing. The inevitable summons case came on,
and one of hubby’s witnesses stated that when he
sa v the lively lady returning from Williams town
races “she looked very impudent and had the
appearance of the majority of women who ride in
hansoms.” This is rather rough on the sex in
general. We have seen hundreds of ladies who
were not impudent riding in hansom cabs. Most
of them looked innocently happy, and had a
decided appearance of being encircled by a strong,
loving arm, and resting their little heads upon a
broad, affectionate shoulder.

There is a clergyman in the South of Eng-
land who is openly and obtrusively “going off his
chump”—if, indeed, he ever had a chump. He
can still read his old sermons pretty well, but
when off duty he drivels about with his jaw hang,
ing, and gazes fishily at his surroundings, or leans
up against a wall and weeps. His parishioners
have stood this a good while, but at last they ap-
pealed to the bishop to get the harmless old im-
becile shifted from the pulpit into an asylum, and
the bishop looked up authorities to see how he
could manage it. This was his answer ;
“I am afraid we can do nothing for you. If you have any
charge to ma ke against his moral charat ter wo would deal
with it; but I regret to say that the mere fact that a mt n is
an idiot is no disqualification,”

There was a lady on the Flemington lawn
last Cup day who has rather a spruce record.
There was once a widow, vegetating in the metro-
polis of the Cabbage Garden, very rich, rather old,
and she had a governess, very poor, rather young.
There was a nice young man who used to visit the
widow only to spoon la gouvtrnante, and now we
have all our dramatis personce. But the widow
fell in love with the nice young man, and sent for
him and told him that if he would lead her to the
altar she would pay him £3OOO at the end of three
years. Well, the nice young man acquiesed. Ete
wedded the lady. For three years he treated
her as she deserved. We delight in ambiguity.
At the end of three years the cash was handed to
him, and the nice young man went away for a
little trip. The governess, who still remained
with the lady, now asked for three days’ absence
to “see her friend,” It was granted. Three
days rolled into four or five and no go
verness showed up. It was not possible, for she
had eloped with the nice young man overland to
Sydney! Our heroine (the lady) scented the
affair and came after them per express. But
alas ! she only learnt that, j hree hours previously,
they h-vd departed on the San Francisco boat for
the land of Yankee Doodle.

At a wedding in Sydney, recently, when it
came to the important ceremony of placing the
golden circlet on the bride’s fair hand, the unfor-
tunate groom groped and searched for the ring
everywhere—in his ears, up his glove, among his
hair, but without that success which he vainly
wished for. Matters were at a standstill, and a
grimy pew-opener, redolent of onions and
piety, suggested, in a hoarse whisper, the door-
key. But a fair bridesmaid, with a smothered
shriek, fell forward and unearthed the missing
trinket gracefully caught on the lace skirt of the
bride. In his flurry the groom must have held
the ring in readiness too soon, and in the exigen-
cies of “I will” let it fall from ms nervous
1 fingers !

The irrepressible Melbourne phrenologist
has turned out a little essay on Lady Carington
and the perfection of womanhood. They are
strangely mixed up together, it seems. Perfection
is Lady C. and Lady C, is perfection. ’ ' According
to the sage it has taken three centuries to build
up the N.S.W. Governoress. The order for her

cuted when Lady Carington came as a “ perfect
woman baby on this planet.’ All the while other-
men and women have been sweating, and toiling,
and starving in order that the ancestors of this
■estimable lady might live a life of calm and cul-
tured ease. It was necessary that those ancestors
should “ lisp their French in the nursery,” enjoy
a musical training “ coeval with their growth,”
and, above all, “ never seo anyone hurried.” If a

In the S.M. Herald of Monday, 22nd
November, 1880, we find the following choice
thing:—
“ De Montfort-Bromley—Ward.— November 7, 1882,

Lancers, youngest son of the late E. F. S. G. de Montfort-
Bromley, of De Montfort Hall, Kent, England, grandson of
the late Edward Ford de Montfort-Bromley, M.D.R.V. (for-
merly Physician Extraordinary to the Duke of Sussex, and
subsequently NaFiU Officer and Colonial Treasurer of Tas-

Bromley), to Helena, fourth daughter of the late James

As Sydney sassiety does all its dancing in

certainly has. There is a popular prejudice

This is from a New York daily comment-
ing on Lord Lonsdale :
That a clisßolute ft flow who leaves a wife at home while
he tags around the country at the heels of a variety actress,
the wife of another man, should he responsible for the ap-
pointment of 40 clergymen to as many parishes—that he
should select the spiritual advisers of some 60,000 souls- is so
flagrant an absurdity that I can but wonder at a social
system that makes it possible, and the temper of a people
who can submit to it.” It is an outrage to decency which no
amount of tradition can justify.”
It will be a terrible day for English “aristocracy
when the people learn the reality of these and
similar truths.
“ The Cheshire hounds lately ” (says
home paper) “had a remarkable run of 55 mile
across country after a smart young fox. It wa
noticed that the huntsmen never came across
corn field in all that long distance.” This circum
stance fully explains the fearful destitution exist
ing in England. The country is laid waste as
breeding-ground for game, or as pleasure grounds
parks, and domains for the idle aristocracy, anc
the poor people who ought to be cultivating the
fields are crammed and crushed into the cities
where millions of them are living on the verge o '
starvation.
The N.S.W. Executive is an “ amoozin
little cuss ” like Artemus Ward’s kangaroo, anc,
Mr. Dibbs is the most “ amoozin’ ” part of the

called for a return of the age, calling, birthplace
and religion of each of the Mount Rennie con
victs, and from it we learn that they were al
born in Australia, and that out of the nine five
are Roman Catholics, three Presbyterians, anc
one an Episcopolian. This is perhaps interesting
but if a man is to be hanged it does not matter
much what his religion may be, and if he is to be
flogged his creed is equally a matter of indif
ference.
Of Mr. Warbon, who has been appointee
Attorney-General of West Australia, the Pall
Mall Gazette writes :
“No one has accused Mr. Warton of hiding great abilitie
under his uncouth exterior; as a politician he was known fo
nothing except an ineradicable passion for impeding public
business for the flimsiest of alleged reasons and to such an
extent that it is almost surprising his fellow M.P.’s did no
lynch him in their disgust; and now that the House of Com
mons is at last relieved of his presence, this man, who simply
dared not face his own constituents at Bridport, is thrus',
down the throats of the people of Western Australia."
Which goes to prove that England’s passion for
making a human rubbish-heap of Australia is not
yet exhausted.
Q here is a little fun now and then even in
that holy house of hog wash, the South Australian
Parliament. The Speaker of the lower Chamber
has a bald, shiny head that looks as if it had been
anointed, and one night towards the end of last
session a reporter “accidentally” dropped the
contents of a bottle of ink on top of the awful
official's reflective scalp. In the same place, some
four years ago, when a member moved “That
this House do adjourn until to-morrow,” an
inebriated journalist yelled from the gallery: “I
move that this gory House do adiourn for 60
blooming years.” This sort of thing amuses the
pious politicians of Adelaide.
The chairman of the Sydney Chamber of
Commerce wants to know “ what protection has
done for America,” and then proceeds lo explain
that it has “ swept her ships from off the face of
the ocean.” This, strange to say, is precisely what
free-trade has done for New South Wales. The
A.S.N. Company, the only important steamship
owners in this colony, are now in course of being
swallowed up by a lascar-employing concern
called the Britiah-India Company. The whole
intercolonial steam-ship traffic will soon be en-
tirely in the hands of Melbourne owners, so far as
colonial owners will be in it at all. Poor M’Millan !
Why doesn’t he stick to rags, and leave “Free-
trade Association papers ” to writers above the

Somebody— it is supposed by Russian in-
stigation-has, it is cabled, been trying to embezzle
King Milan, of Servia, but unluckily he did not
succeed. Milan could w-ell be spared, for he is
the ugliest, meanest, gnarled little image in
Europe, and during the last war he dressed him-
self up in bullet-proof armour, and wheezed with
abject terror in a bullock-dray ten miles in the
rear of his army. He came to the throne because
he was the grand nephew of Milosh Obrenovitch, a
gallant old party who used to drive pigs before he
became a King. Milosh, in fact, was promoting
agility in a swine when a deputation summoned
him tb take command of the patriot army in 1815,
and as he could not afford in the then state of the
civil list to lose the brute, he and the crowd of
nobles drove it before them at a fearful bat till
they reached the camp. The difference between
the brave old rebel and his descendant is that one
came from the pigs and the other is going to the
dogs.
If there is another man on earth who can
aim at a great economic truth and make a worse
shot than Cardinal Manning, we would like to
make his acquaintance. The Cardinal figures out
a scheme by which every unemployed workman,
every penniless loafer and drunkard, every dotard,
pauper, and imbecile in the United Kingdom can
be shipped off to Australia, and yet both Britain
and Austral ?, bf con c the richer for the trans-
action. The passage-money of the horde is to
be paid in advance, and the loans for this purpose
are to be secured by mortgage on the “ lands
granted or sold to the emigrants by the colonial
governments.” His Eminence is apparently under
the impression that Australians are actually
howling for a chance to give away their public
estate to every drunken vagrant who comes along,
and that when an individual who is fit for nothing
but to bask in the sun and serve as a beer adver-
tisement, is exported, we will convert him into a
landowner at sight and be thankful for the
privilege.
“ In spite of the many sickly attempts made
by weak-minded philanthropists to persaudc us to
the contrary, the only way to govern Australia,
for a few more decades, at any rate, is by a plenti-
ful application of the cat and halter.” This re-
mark is quoted from the leading article in Harris’
Weekly, a Newcastle (N.S.W.) journal about the
size of a dishonoured cheque, which caters for
small boys by publishing stories of the Buffalo
Bill description, and from a note at the foot we
discovered that the bloodthirsty yell for dead
bodies has been cadged from Society, a Sydney
publication. There is something refreshing about
this second-hand yelp for slaughter. From all
that has been said and written during the last few
weeks, it is plain that there arc in Australia thou-
sands of people who love blood with a big B, and
who would rather see crime doubled by the gallows
than halved by its abolition. Such people will
never be satisfied until every Government cat
consists of nine miles of wire attached to a handle
made out of a telegraph-post.
From Judge Windcyer’s letter aneut the
recent legal “row”,;
“ He (Mr. Salomons) said : ‘At all events yon will do what
yon can to assist me. There is some work I am not familiar
with—sentencing prisoners, and such matters.’ He referred to
some hook of mine which he thought would help him, and
asked me if 1 would lend it to him. I said 1 Certainly.’ ”
Mr. Salomons must have his little joke ; even
when discussing his new appointment he could
not help having a shot at the renowned criminal
judge. He was not familiar with the work of
sentencing prisoners, so would seek instruction
from eminent authority on the subject. Despite
Mr. Salomons’ denial of Mr. Windeyer’s state-
ments we are very much tempted to believe that
this portion of the interview is correctly reported.
The keen satirical wit is just what might have
been expected from the Q.C., and the solemn way
in which the sarcasm is reported as a matter of
fact is much akin to what has been previously
noticed of the Judge’s more obtuse intellect. But
we would like to see that “ book.” If Mr. Justice
Windeyer, who, it is plain, must be utterly desti-
tute of humour, takes from its pages either hia
sentences or Judicial orations, the sooner that book
has a millstone round its neck and is cast into the
sea the better will it be for his reputation as a
criminal judge.
Here is something for the N.S.W. Minis-
ter of Public Instruction to chew over :
“ Editor Bulletin.—Sir, —Now that Government is re-
trenching, I wish to suggest a scheme by which many thou-
sands could be saved annually in connection with the De-
partment of Public Instruction. It is this. The law compels
children to attend school not less than 70 days every half-
year from the time they are 65 years of age till they are 14.
But why admit them before they are 6J ? They do not learn
very much, they take up a lot of time that would be spent by
the teacher to much greater advantage with the elder
pupils, they tend to destroy school discipline, and their
health is impaired by being shut up all day in comparatively
impure air. These are but a few of a multitude of reasons I
could give why the children, for their own good, should not
be admitted to the schools before the age stated. But to re-
turn to retrenchment. You are well aware that teachers
are paid in accordance with the attendance. The school I
have charge of is of the seventh class, but if the pupils belew
the age of 64 years were not counted it would be a very
poor eighth class. Therefore, by excluding or not count
ing the infants, a saving of £2i a year would
be e.feoted in my school alone, and I am quite
confident an equal, and in some cases a greater, amount
would be saved in nearly every school in the colony. We
have only to turn our attention to the large schools in the
metropolis and other large towns, and we will see that by
causing the parents to keep their babies at home, scores of
teachers could be dispensed with. You may think it strange
of me, a teacher, advocating the dismissal of teachers, but it
is for the good of my Vateilandldo it. Another waste of
public money is the employment of truant officers. They
might be requisite in very populous places, but out in the
country they do more harm than gpod. I speak from ex-
perience. Why can’t tbe police do their work ? The teacher
could furnish a list of defaulters to the police officers just as
easily as to a school attendance officer. And tbe parents
would be a hundred-fold more frightened of the police,
besides which they would think it more of a disgrace to be
summoned by them, and they would take care to send their
children to school more regularly. In my opinion, if the
country teachers were consulted, nine-tenths of them would
be in favour of the abolition of the school attendance
branch.—Yours truly, A Cornstalk Teacher. ’
Edith O’Gorman Auffray gave £3l 11s.,
proceeds of a lecture, to the Lismore hospital. It
is to be hoped that, in the eternal fitness of things
it wasn’t all absorbed by the victims of her riots.
It is reported that the A.S.N. Company
are about to sell out its boats to the 8.1.5. N, Com-
pany for £200,000; that the German armyis to be in-
creased by 41,000 men ; that the Czar has gone
mad and shot one of his personal attendants dead ;
that Bulgaria is going to the dogs ; and that the
Ameer of Afghanistan has already gone there. A
snake-story and a gigantic pumpkin art unavoid-
ably held over.
Sour are the uses of adversity. He had
been a trusted employe for years, but had been
“sacked” by his boss, and had finally come to
Abrahams and Co. for work. “ I have been in
the same situation for 15 years,” he proudly said.
“ Stopped until you weren’t any darned use,” ob-
served the head of the firm, and then that aspirant,
with his 15 years’ character, was trundled down
the stairs by the sub-pro-vice-deputy-assistant
office boy’s chucker.
The latest snake-perjury. At Cootamun-
dra, N.S.W., a large, lead coloured reptile was
slain, and on being opened it proved to contain 19
young ones. Inside one of (he latter was one still
younger, and probably this process might have
been repeated until 70 times seven—l9o small
snakes—but unhappily- the investigation was
dropped at this point. The story is vouched for
by the Liberal, and the same paper has sighted
some oats 7ft. Sin. high. Hallelujah!
A queer little yarn from the land ruled by
Samuel the Mysterious. A Clermont (Q.) journalist
dined with a haughty-looking stranger, and hap-
pened to mention the N.BW. Chief Justiceship.
Instantly the imposing man fired up and cursed
Salomons and all his family right back to the
original ancestor who cracked nuts while swing-
ing head downwards by his tail ; he also said the
eminent lawyer didn’t know enough to pound
sand, and that a decent man wouldn’t allow- him-
self to be found dead within ten miles of him. It
was not till next day that the journalist found he
had been talking to Wright, Heaton, and Co.’s
manager, and then he suddenly understood the
whole thing.
Murder, regarded as one of the fine arts,
is not properly understood by Frenchmen. In
Algeria, recently, two Arabs were to be executed
for murder, one of them being condemned on the
testimony of his wife, who looked on at the exe-
cution. She saw more than she bargained for.
The guillotine broke down after cutting her hus
band a good deal about the neck, and while the
Arab kicked and howled, the executioner hung on
frantically to the machine and tried to get another
chop. Then he got a saw and started to grind the
criminal in two, but the latter individual was suf-
fering from the jumps or something and would
not keep still. At last, however, a razor was em-
ployed, and the Arab’s head was hacked off.^


BREAKING BP.
On every hand we see evidences that winter is breaking up,
and wilisoon have to yield to the advancing spiing. It ia a
most important question to scientific men wad c-mses the
general feeling of debility and lassitude so prevalent in this
region. While some regard it as the result of confinement
and inaction, others suppose it t.) be caused by the decay of
vegetable and animal debris which has accumulated during
the winter. What is especially needed at this time, however,
is something to overcome these influences. It is too late to
talk about the causes ; what is thecute? thousand of persons
all over the country who have givm Dr. Bell's Bitters a
faithful trial art ready to testify that no other remedy is
equal to it for cleansing the system, puritying the blood,
regulating tire bowels, and curing all kidney and liver
diseases. It is, in fact, the king of all medicines.

The Autophone is a wonderful little instrument
which, while it weighs less than three pounds has
the lungs of a full sized parlor organ, and executes
its music with absolute precision and perfect
effect. It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three
keys, and all the pai ts of most difficult music. On
it a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of ever
300 selections from hymns, oratorios, operas,
waltzes, polkas, marches, popular songs, &o. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, but also has wonderful power in exe-
cuting very lively pieces. SS" It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card holder for convenience
in singing. It is entirely well adapted for country
churches, Sunday schools, the family circle, and
also for dancing. The music is compact, and far
cheaper than that which is made for any organette.
The Autophone is like every other good thing, the

“ Gentlemen, —It gives me pleasure to state
that the performance of the Watch manufactured
by you, and marked ‘B. W. Raymond No. 19,201,’
which I have carried in my pocket for a period of
six months, surpasses in excellence that of any of
the fine watches I have hitherto tested. It main-
tains its rate even better than a fine box chrono-
meter by Negus, belonging to this observatory.
I have intended, when I shall have leisure, to
make a complete test of the isochronism of the
balance for poise and temperature. So far as I
can judge by the performance of the watch, those
adjustments appear to be nearly perfect,
“ Permit me to congratulate you upon the
successful manufacture of watches which are
equal in performance to the pocket chronometers
by Jurgensen, Fordsham, and other celebrated
European makers.

The above is a faithful likeness of the man who
says that rheumatism is an invention of the devil.
He is a gentleman and a scholar ; speaks several
nguages, and has got the biggest foot in Aus-
tralia.
Ho is very wealthy and good-looking; has
enty of friends, but his clothes don’t fit him.
He has completely used up every profane word
in the Colonial and other languages, still he is not
happy.
He says there is enough thoroughbred agony
and hellish torture in his foot to kill every sinner
in creation.
He has been a Member of Parliament, a Minister
of the Crown, and an Alderman, but does not re-
member having done anything to deserve his
sufferings.
He has always been devout; and at one period
of his life a government contractor.
He has tried all the doctors and nearly every-
thing under the sun, but the villain still pursues
him.
He tells everybody that trying to cure rheu-
matism is like trying to shovel wind off the roof.
Or trying to get a sinecure in the Civil Service
without friends in the House, or marrying into a
high-toned family.
He says that rheumatism cannot be cured. His
grandfather told him so. And he thinks that
settles it.
He is sadly mistaken. It is a fact that a remedy
has been found which relieves and cures rheu-
matism, lust as sure as the sun shines in the
heavens. It is used externally. It conquers pain_
It goes right to the spot. It cures when every-
thing else has failed. It penetrates to the seat of
the disease. It is simple. It is safe. It is cer-
tain.
Mr. James Marlow, merchant tailor, 11, Flinders-
street East, Melbourne, was under medical treat-
ment for rheumatism for months at a time, and
suffered severely both in health and pseket. He
tried all sorts of remedies without obtaining rebef,
until he got St Jacobs oil, when “ the first appli-
cation gave me instant relief, and I am thankful
to say that I have not experienced the slightest
symptom of pain ever since.
Edward Evans, formerly with Davey'and Moore,
London, was declared incurable at three hospitals.
He was nearly crazy from rheumatism. The
doctors said he must die. St. Jacobs Oil cured
him. He says; “It saved my life.” William
Beach, champion oarsman of the world, writes :
“ 1 gladly endorse St. Jacobs Oil. It conquers
pain.”
Maurice D. Benjamin, Esq., importer and whole-
sale merchant, late of Brisbane, Queensland,
writes“ I had my doubts at first of St. Jacobs
Oil eradicating rheumatism ; but as I have practi-
cally tested its efficacy, I can honestly state that
it has wonderful rheumatic healing qualities.”
Henry Ricketts, Westbury, Gloucestershire, was
pronounced incurable at Bath Hospital. His pains
were terrible. St. Jacobs Oil cured him. After
practical tests on invalids in hospitals and else-
where, St. Jacobs Oil was awarded six gold medals
in America, Australia, and India. It has cured
people who had been crippled from pain for over
?0 years.
William Gitechink, a stoker, belonging to
H.I.M.S. Albatross, was compelled to remain in
Auckland when the Albatross sailed for Samoa,
on account of his dreadful sufferings from rheu-
matism. He says : —‘' I have now perfectly re-
covered, and it is entirely owing to the free appli-
cation of your wonderful remedy St. Jacobs Oil.
A CASH reward of £100 will be paid by the
CHARLES A. YOGLER COMPANY, of BALTI-
MORE, MARYLAND, UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, proprietors of St. Jacobs Oil, or by
their accredited local representatives, to any per-
son producing proof to the effect that the testi-
monials published by them in regard to St. Jacobs
Oil are not strictly genuine.

“Populaire.”
OnTuesdaythe 7th inst.,atSydney Govern-
ment House, the new Australian comic opera
“ Populaire ” was performed in the presence of
the most artistic and fashionable audience that
could be gathered in Sydney. The plot of the
play borders on extreme simplicity, in fact there
is so little plot that, after two hours and a. half of
the closest attentipn, we were unable to discover
the general drift of the proceedings. The idea
that pervades the piece is the desire to satirize the
triumph and standing of muscle over brains.
We are not sure but that the muscles
win every time. The circumstances surrounding
this first production were all in its favour. There
was no upper gallery and spare store eggs to in-
terrupt the show, so the authors and actors had
things all their own way. H.E. and Lady Car-
ington had most kindly fitted up (heir ball-room
with a miniature stage that was very admiral 1 > in
its completeness. All that the hosts could do was
performed. When we have said that we have
said much. The audience might reasonably bo
supposed to be in the best of spirits, still the
sad fact remains that they never w ore once
moved to an approach to enthusiasm,for not in one
scene, nor in one song, did the guests forget their
weariness of spirit. The music, we have most
reluctantly to confess, never rose above the level
of ordinary composition, and had it not been for
some half-dozen energetic and admirable book-
makers, nothing would have saved the piece from
utter prostration. A ballad sung by Clara (Miss
E, A. Foxall), in the third act, was perhaps the
most favourably received. But as it had pre-
viously been published by Glen and Co.,
Melbourne, it was not exactly a novelty.
“ Populaire ” is termed a “ comic” opera, but be-
yond the general idea of satirising an athlete,
there is nothing humorous in the words, and the
situations are positively sepulchral in their
sombrencss. Humour seems to have been studi-
ously omitted from the words, and was not
admitted on the stage for one moment. As one
of our fellow-sufferers—a man who is very much
before the public just now—remarked : “ Every-
thing should be left out except the intervals.” Of
the performers we have only to say that they had
a superhuman task to perform, and they
t through very creditably. Mr. Hallewell was in
fine voice, and though not quite anyone’s idea of
an athlete, managed to support his part to e /ery-
one’s satisfaction. The Muriel of Miss Josephine
Dcakin, and the Clara of Miss Foxall, were careful
studies, bar the words in the first-named lady’s
rendition. She went in for words of her own
and we did not blame her much. Mr. Monie as
Long Odds, and his associated bookmakers, carried
off the belt. Without them nothing could have
kept the audience in their seats. The scenery was
neat and appropriate, the steamers and wager-
boats being admirable and also of the same size.
We trust that in any future efforts the composer
and his author will be more successful.
With the consummation of the bargain
between the Queensland Shipping Co. and the
A.S.N. Co. for the purchase of the latter’s fleet,
‘'Sydney, the capital of a continent, one of the
great ports of the world, will no longer be the
headquarters of an intercolonial shipping com-
pany. Queensland, Victorian, South Australian,
and New Zealand boats will enter Port Jackson.”
This is from the Sydney D.T., and is, we presume,
intended as an argument in favour of the N.S.W
Freetrado policy.
Important Business Change in
Sydney.
The people of Sydney have been awakened
daring the last few days by the announcement of
an important business change, and this change Is
in such harmony with common sense and the re-
quirements of the people that it must eventually
revolutionise this branch of trade. Messrs. A.
Finlayson and Company, the importers and manu-
facturers of the celebrated Standard brand of
clothing have followed the lead of some of the
great London merchants, and turned their ware-
house into a huge retail house of trade and retail
tailoring establishment. What is really meant is
this : This wealthy firm of merchants and manu-
facturers, while still carrying on their large im-
porting business, have resolved to deal direct
with the people. We know, of course, that
Messrs. Finlayson and Co. import and manufac-
ture clothing for retail houses in the city
and the country, and these retailers do
a great trade on the profit of 83 per
cent, or more which they get from the people.
This firm, however, say they will deal with the
people themselves, and vivstly increase their
bonuses by giving them this 83 per cent. Tills
thing must simply revolutionise the clothing trade
of Sydney, and Mossis. Finlayson and Co. deserve
great credit for initiating the thing in Australia.
What has boon stated refers to the ready-made
clothing, but the firm go further. Being whole-
sale manufacturers, they take up the tailoring as
was never previously attempted in this country.
A person may now go to this large warehouse,
York and Barrack streets, and, after selecting a
piece of tweed 38 per cent, loss in price than
retail,can have his suit made to measure at manu-
facturers’ figures. Really this arrangement
means a come down in fashionable suits
to measure of from £5 down to about
£2 16s. or £3 10s. People needn’t buy
their own material; they can bring it,
and the making-up and finishing will bo found
to be at wholesale rates. For householders,
heads of families, artizans, clerks, anybody, in
fact, this new business of Messrs. Finlayson and
Co,’s must be a boon. The thing is an enormous
success in London. Nearly all the big houses now
do it. Why shouldn’t the innovation he a big hit
in Australia as well. The prices os quoted by
Messrs. Finlayson are simply extraordinary, and
will show how people pay through the nose for
goods bought in the old retail stylo. The premises
of the firm are worth inspection as showing great
preparedness for the work. There are various
xpansive well ventilated departments, for the
wlk stock, packing, show, and business rooms,
eady-made and order-cutting branches, coat de-
triments, each showing great activity and vast
mtput. It’s needless to say that the new idea has
dready proved a big success,and Messrs. Finlayson
ieserve every success for their pluck and enter-
rise. It may be noted Mi at the firm have a city
ouse and show-rooms in King-street, next the
*aily Telegraph, where samples and stylos may
e seen and orders left. 1 his King-street shop is
vithout exception the handsomest and with re-
pect to material one of the best shop of the kind
n all Australia. *
Mr. John Osborne, who has started on
he Sydney Sunday lecture platform, last Sunday
night, at the New Masonic Hall, delivered the
first of his series on “ The Passing Aw ay of
Theology.” There was an excellent attendance.
Two hundred and fifty tons of wire,-the
quantity required in the erection of a rabbit-proof
dividing fence across 180 miles of the Queensland
and N-S.W. border, has just been landed at Wil-
cannla. But, as a mat ter of fact, the rabbits are
already over the boundary-line !
Two Hobart solicitors appeared in court
the other day to explain why they had not
accounted for certain trust moneys, but as it
appeared they had paid up on proceedings being
taken against them, they got off with a repri-
mand. As there is not in these colonies one law
for the rich and another for the poor, wo would
suggest that every thief who finds ho is going to
bo proceeded against should square up promptly
and get off in like manner.
Though the white man may not
Fly him bow-wow in him pan
Alice samee Chineeman,
there is a striking resemblance between the two
when they are led up to the triangles. At Bris-
bane, a day or two ago, a German named Leisner
had the honour of being flogged just before War
Yeh —even here the white man leads the way and
the degraded Mongol brings up the rear—and at
every cut of the lash he yelled “ Oh, Gcd !” Then
the Asiatic was tied up and the official started to
tear the skin off the wretch's yellow hide, and ho
screeched also, lust like a European. But the
audience could not translate his howl, so the
sapient reporter put it down as “evidently a
Chinese oath.” There are .16 gods in the Mongol
Pantheon, and probably War Yeh was calling on
them all at once, but vulgar prejudice kept the
little cholera-coloured man from getting the bene-
fit of the doubt even while being flayed alive.
A man broke out of the gaol at Tumber-
umba eight years ago and was only caught the
other day. He was arrested not for escaping but
for carrying the gaol away with him and selling
it for lire wood. He would have been still at large
if he had not unwisely written a letter to the
Albury paper refusing to be nominated as a Town
Councillor.
They were shearers in want of work, but
they woiddn't sign an agreement for 17s. Gd., and
rode away in much wrath, for the jumbuck-king
was full of anger and sarcasm. And after much
riding they came to another station whose owner
listened to their tale with much interest, but he
wanted not shearers. Nevertheless he treated
them with much kindness, and hiring the services
of a photographer he procured likenesses of them
in groups. And this did rejoice their vanity, but
as they journeyed down that river they got no
work, for the wool masters did watch for their
coming and treat them scornfully.
