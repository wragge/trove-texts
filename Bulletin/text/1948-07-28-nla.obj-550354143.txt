is a city which is full
of interest to the student of religion,
history, architecture and literature! Its
documented history goes back for 1300
years. Under the Britons it was known
as Dur-whern, and Lucius, a British
king, is credited with building the first
Christian church in a.d. 187 on or about
the site of the present cathedral.
During the four centuries of Roman
occupation the town was known as
DurovernUm, an important commercial
post standing at the convergence of mili-
tary roads from the Kentish ports of
Dover, Lympne and Richborough, which
here formed a great thoroughfare leading
to the Thames crossing at Londinium.
Excavations that were begun by German
bombs in 1942 and 1944 (which de-
stroyed the cathedral library) have un-
covered many new Roman relics.
The Saxons re-named the town
Cantwarabyrig (fortress of the men of
Kent), and at about the year 560 it be-
came the capital of Ethelbert, King of
Kent. To this court St. Augustine and
his fellow-missionaries from Rome were
welcomed in 597. The king granted them
the use of the church, and was himself
baptised with thousands of his subjects,
thus it was that Canterbury became the
mother-city of the Church of England.
In addition to the famous cathedral
there are many other notable features of
the city; King’s School, partly occupying
the ancient monastery, numbers amongst
its scholars Christopher Marlowe, Sir
Hugh Walpole and Mr. Somerset Maug-
ham ; the ancient city wall and West
Gate and many medieval houses, of
which the Weaver’s Cottage, on the bank
of the River Stour, shown here, is a
picturesque example. Here lived Flemish
and Huguenot refugee weavers, who
settled in Canterbury after the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The in-
dustry of silk weaving, which at one time
employed two thousand persons, was in
this way introduced into England. The
weavers were given the use of the crypt
of Canterbury Cathedral for their re-
ligious services, and, in the early days, the
crypt was also used as a work-room in
which they set up their silk-looms. In
later years Sunday services in French
were still held for the descendants of
these Protestant exiles.

HAMLET BY MOONSHINE.
The “final” essay on “Hamlet” was
published 40 years ago by Professor A. C.
Bradley in his Shakspearean Tragedy.
Bradley, whose theory is that Hamlet is.
the victim of a “paralysing melancholy,”
a nervous breakdown caused by the shock
of his mother’s hasty remarriage and his
father’s murder, has that graceful, lucid
and irresistible logic to be found in
Matthew Arnold and in Plato.
Except in the case of Ophelia, where
he suffered a little from the critical dis-
advantage of being a thoroughly nice-
minded Englishman, it is not possible, as
Salvador Madariaga attempts in On
Hamlet (Hollis and Carter), to dispute
with Bradley. The text, commonsense
and what is known of the symptoms of
nervous collapse—particularly the inabil-
ity to make decisions —all combine to
make his viewpoint irrefutable.
But it is always possible to add to
Bradley; to find further proofs of the
correctness of his theory. We may, for
instance, consider the fact that Shak-
speare was a literary man ; a creative
artist: for that paralysis of the will, that
black and abysmal despair from which
Hamlet suffers, that mood in which “this
majestical roof fretted with golden fire”
seems no more than “a foul and pestilent .
congregation of vapours,” is something
with which all creative artists are too
well acquainted, and which Shakspeare,
supreme in the arts, must have known
supremely well. It is the hell in which art
seems meaningless.
Bradley is aware (and after him
Madariaga) that the list of griefs and
troubles Hamlet makes in the famous
“To be or not to be” soliloquy are sin-
gularly inappropriate to a Prince of Den-
mark :
For who would bear the whips and scorns
of time,
The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s
contumely,
The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? —
but neither of these critics remarks, in so
many words, how appropriate is the list
to Shakspeare himself; who went much
to law, who showed in the sonnets and in
the plays which deal with jealousy how
much he knew of “the pangs of despis’d
love” and who, at the mercy of official-
dom and surrounded by lesser artists and
mere businessmen of the theatre,* must
have known too well “the insolence of
office” and “the spurns that patient merit
of the unworthy takes.”
Here, then, we may add a little to
Bradley ; something by way of confirma-
tion. We may compare the list of griefs
in the soliloquy with the list in Sonnet
LXVI and the mood of the soliloquy
with the mood of the sonnet:
Tir’d with all these for restful death I cry—
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And art made tongue-tied by authority—
and we may conclude that the play is in-
deed, as Madariaga on one occasion
says, largely “a soliloquy by Shakspeare
to Shakspeare” ; that it is, as Bradley
says, a study of paralysing melancholy;
and that, specifically, it is a study of that
paralysing melancholy which Shakspeare
had experienced as an artist. Hamlet is
not, of course, a portrait of Shakspeare,
but he is drawn from an aspect of
Shakspeare; from the creative artist’s
black mood of despair, hatred of man-
kind and collapse of the will to act: a
mood very plausibly transferred to a
quick-tempered, sensitive and intelligent
Prince, given to writing in his “tablets,”
who saw all civilised values destroyed in
the “bestial” remarriage of his mother
and the murder of his father.
Had Madariaga founded his essay on
this theme he might well have added
something valuable to Bradley. But he is,
alas, chiefly bent upon confounding
Bradley; and in the course of that im-
possible task he talks an astounding
amount of nonsense for a man who has
translated “Hamlet” into Spanish verse.
He submits two new theories, one on
Hamlet and one on Ophelia, and both of
these, with all due respect, are largely
moonshine.
On Ophelia Madariaga’s case rests
principally on two ingenious misquota-
tions ; or, to be precise, one misquotation
and one misinterpretation. In the first
of these he is misled by Professor Dover
Wilson, who decided that when Shak-
speare had Hamlet complaining
O that this too too solid flesh would melt
what he really meapt to. write was
O that this too too sullied flesh would melt.
'This is, of course, a very pretty piece
of scholarship. It would also be very
pretty, and would lead to many new in-
genious theories, to suggest that Shaks-
peare actually wrote “sillied flesh” and
was thus referring to Hamlet’s madness,
or “salad flesh” and thus was speaking
about Hamlet’s green youth. But what
Shakspeare wrote was, beyond doubt,
0 that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Let us think, for a moment, of reality:
of “sullied” flesh ; of, say, a tainted leg
of lamb. If Shakspeare had been think-
ing of that kind of “sullied” flesh he
would have had Hamlet cry “O that this
too too sullied flesh could be frozen,
could be burnt, could be purified, could
be washed.” But he was thinking of too
too solid flesh that, in metaphor, could
reasonably be asked to melt, to vanish
into heaven in a dewy vapor. “Melt,”
“thaw” and “dew” following “solid”
make it clear that the traditional render-
ing of the line is correct.
But Madariaga finds that “sullied” flesh
fits in nicely with his theory that Hamlet
had seduced Ophelia before the play
opens, so “sullied” it becomes.
In the second of his textual errors
Madariaga, while not going to the
length of altering Shakspeare’s words,
alters the meaning of “nunnery,” and so
when Hamlet tells Ophelia to “Get thee
to a nunnery” he is, so Madariaga asserts,
telling her to go to a brothel; thereby
proving again to his own satisfaction, if
to nobody else’s, that Ophelia is “a fast
girl, an Elizabethan flirt with no par-
ticular inhibitions about anything” and
that she has had an “affair” with Hamlet.
On what authority Madariaga assumes
that “nunnery” in Elizabethan times was
a slang term for a brothel is not stated.
The term, ominously, is not recorded in
Eric Partridge’s monumental Shakspeare’s
Bawdy , and if Partridge has missed an
obscenity in Shakspeare the world of
scholarship will quake indeed. Perhaps
the fact can be established; but even
then, “nunnery” - certainly meant “nun-
nery” as well as “brothel,” and it means
plain “nunnery” in Shakspeare’s play.
This, likewise, is to be discovered simply
by looking at the words which follow
“nunnery” and, with perfect clarity, ex-
pound it:
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst
thou be a breeder of sinners? If thou
dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for
thy dowry,—be thou as chaste as ice, as
pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go
1 say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but
one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they
are. To a nunnery, go.
In a brothel, surely, it is possible to
become a “breeder of sinners,” Hamlet
is telling Ophelia to go to some place
where she can escape the fate of those
who marry and breed sinners: and where
else, then, but to a nunnery? *,
If Shakspeare means what he says, as
he generally did, we find that the nunnery
scene, instead of proving Ophelia to have
been Hamlet’s mistress, as Madariaga
would like it to, proves the opposite. If
Hamlet had indeed been her lover he
would hardly waste time telling Ophelia
that “be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.”
He would know that she was not pure as
snow and chaste as ice. But knowing that
she is, he tells her she shall keep as she
is; by going to a nunnery.
Were not the whole of On Hamlet,
from the jacket onwards, set in the
climate of moonshine, it would be sur-
prising that Madariaga adopts the
“sullied” misquotation, for it spoils his
fundamental theory, which is that Hamlet
is an “egocentric,” lewd and ruthless
person who doesn’t care a damn for any-
one. What is a lewd and selfish Hamlet
doing apostrophising the heavens about
his “too too sullied flesh” simply because
he has seduced a “fast Elizabethan flirt”?
Madariaga’s Hamlet could not possibly
feel himself sullied if he had seduced
Diana herself.
But a little inconsistency does not
trouble Madariaga, for he manages, too,
to be inconsistent about Ophelia.
Ophelia, he says, is a fast girl,
an Elizabethan flirt “with no particular
inhibitions about anything.” Weil and
good; let us admit that for the sake of
argument. Ophelia, he says, never loved
Hamlet although she had been his
mistress. Well and good; let us admit
that minor inconsistency fls, in human
wickedness, possible. Ophelia, he says,
goes mad not because she loves Hamlet
or her father but because she “carries in
her young heart a secret she can only bear
when shared with Hamlet,” the secret
of their amorous relationship. Hamlet
has gone mad and is lost to her and “the
pressure becomes' unbearable, and she
must tell all. Sane she cannot speak; in-
sane she must become.”
Here, once again, is a very oretty
theory, and Madariaga supports it by
stating (quite wrongly, of course) that
Ophelia is confessing her “sin” with
Hamlet by her bawdy songs in the mad
scene. But where on earth has Madariaga
encountered a “fast girl,” a “flirt with no
inhibitions” who goes mad because she is
bursting to confess that she has been
naughty? The madness scene clearly
necessitates a tender and sensitive Opheiia
who has lost the father she loves at the
hands of the man she loves; and when
she sings her bawdy songs she is not con-
fessing anything except the desires which,
concealed in the privacy of fantasy or in
the mind’s darkness, underlie her
innocence. If Ophelia is not innocent,
the pathos and deep truth of the bavWy
scene are lost.
Madariaga can, indeed, confidently be
relied on to go astray on every important
point he brings up. There is, for a
further instance, his rebuttal of the
Freudian theory that Hamlet is a victim
of the (Edipus complex and cannot be
bothered killing his uncle because he
really wants to kill his father.
This, to be sure, is a theory quite as
hopeless as any of Madariaga’s, and it
is pleasing to see it attacked. Hamlet, as
the text shows most emphatically, does
not hate his father; he genuinely re-
veres him, and that in a very sensible,
manly fashion:
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
Does he then love his mother, in the
Freudian sense of the phrase? Certainly
he uses strangely coarse language to her,
suggesting that he is in a morbid state
of mind. And so he is; but not in the
mental state of (Edipus. It is not merely
his mother’s remarriage, but the double
shock of that and the murder of his
father that brings about his “paralysing
melancholy” and it is when he learns of
the murder that he collapses. Consider
Hamlet’s situation as if it had occurred
in everyday life: within “a little month”
of his father’s death his mother has re-
married. Who would not be shocked, if
it happened in his own family; if it
happened in any family one happened to
be acquainted with ? It would be shock-
ing if the woman had merely redecorated
the palace, got drunk on the day of the
funeral, gone in for wild parties; had
done anything that outraged civilised
behavior. And the marriage is, in
Hamlet’s eyes, and the eyes of all Den-
mark, “incestuous.” Who would not be
shocked? And the man his mother has
married, his father’s brother, is the
murderer of his father, always suspected
(“O my prophetic soul!”) soon known
as such for certain. And his father's
ghost, no fantasy from his subconscious
mind but a terrible apparition seen first
by his friends on the battlements, comes
telling of the horrors of hell and demand-
ing revenge. What sensitive man would
not be as much shaken as Hamlet? The
whole structure of civilised life, the core
of which is family affection, family trust
and family pride, has been destroyed for
Hamlet at one blow; that, not any mor-
bid passion for his mother, is what has
paralysed his will, shattered his faith in
men and women alike, and set loose upon
his tongue the coarse phrases of rage and
disillusion, the images of madness and
despair. “Man delights not me ; no, nor
woman neither.”
Madariaga, instead of dealing at length
with what he rightly calls Freud’s “fan-
ciful theory,” replaces the (Edipus fancy
with the fancy that Hamlet does not love
his mother at all, even in the ordinary
way of family affection:
Hamlet does not love his mother, not
even in the carnal way an extravagant
theory would have us believe. He just
thinks her.
But the violence of Hamlet’s language
to his mother is surely the measure of
a genuine and deep affection which she
has shattered, and even in his rage and
disgust a strong filial regard still lingers
—“Forgive me this my virtue 1 must
be cruel only to be kind And when
you are desirous to be blessed I’ll bless-
ing beg of you.”
All these alterations and misinterpreta-
tions of the text, these shafts and glim-
merings of moonshine spring, inevitably,
from Madariaga’s central moon of error:
his theory that Hamlet is an “egocentric”
man, that and no more:
The only principle capable of giving an
order and a coherence to the character, the
only explanation for all he says and does,
is that Hamlet is egocentric When we
realise that the centre of Hamlet’s interest,
thought, motive and emotion is his own
self, the play becomes as clear as the solar
system after Copernicus, when astronomers
were at last able to drop their cycles
and epicycles and refer everything in
simple ellipses to the sun.
Let us, again for the sake of argument,
agree with Madariaga. Let us use the
horrible piece of j,argon he has borrowed
from the psychoanalysts he scorns.
Hamlet is “egocentric” ; that and nothing
more. The centre of his interest, thought,
motive and emotion is his own self. He
does not, then, care a rap for Yorick,
even when he sighs regret over his skull.
He does not, then, care a rap for Ophelia
even when, drawing his hand over the
lines of her face.
He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound
That it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being; that done, he lets me
go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn’d,
He seem’d to find his way without his eyes;
For out o’ doors he went without their help,
And to the last bended their light on me.
He does not care a rap for his father,
even when he says:
See what a grace was seated on his brow;
Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself;
A combination and a form, indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man.
He does not love his mother ;he does not
hate his uncle. Well and good. But why
then should Hamlet bother to go through
the play at all? Through the agony
and torment of the play ; through the re-
proaches of his conscience? Why not
just laugh at the ghost, shrug his shoul-
ders at his mother’s remarriage, clap his
uncle on the back, give the “fast Eliza-
bethan flirt” a last light goodbye kiss and
go off to Wittenburg?
Since he is well enough acquainted with
Bradley to disagree with him, Madariaga
should have taken to heart the professor’s
warning about “views which are unsatis-
factory because they isolate one element
in Hamlet’s character and situation and
treat it as the whole”: for that is pre-
cisely whaf Madariaga has done, with
both Ophelia and Hamlet.
He does not, one is glad to say, talk
moonshine all the time ;on the contrary,
he does in certain respects add something
to Bradley. Ophelia is not Hamlet’s
mistress ; she is not the “fast Elizabethan
flirt without inhibitions” ; but at least
Madariaga makes out a good case for
reading in her character a touch of
roguishness that is not usually noticed or
played.
Madariaga has missed here one point
in his favor, a hint as to Ophelia’s real
nature which also escaped Bradley. When
Ophelia, assuring Polonius that Hamlet’s
intentions are strictly honorable, says
that he has sworn so
By almost all the holy vows of heaven
there is, conceivably, something of a
smile, a twinkling of roguishness in that
word “almost.”
It is quite likely, again, to consider
Madariaga’s points, that when she tells
Laertes not to give her good advice and
t|ien go away and tread himself “the
primrose path of dalliance” she may be
laughing, secretly or openly; but that
certainly does not prove, as Madariaga
thinks, that she had been Hamlet’s mis-
tress. It is possible, once more, in the
“obscene” dialogue during the play scene,
that Ophelia is not as shocked at Hamlet’s
lewdness as she should be in the usual
interpretation of her character; possible,
even, that when she tells Hamlet his wit
is getting “still better and worse” she is
amused; but when Madariaga asserts
that if she were truly innocent she would
have to leave the room he forgets that
Ophelia is talking to a Prince, a person-
age she would be bold indeed to snub
in public. Nothing that she says could
not be said reprovingly, nothing is abso-
lutely incompatible with modesty. If she
seems a little inconsistent, she may be
showing due deference to royalty, she
may be placating a madman or, at most,
she may be playful. There are hints of
her femininity, perhaps, to prepare for
the revelation made by the bawdy songs.
As to Hamlet’s “egoCentricity,” that
has not gone unnoticed in the past, for
Bradley, though not liking to dwell on
this aspect of his character, remarks on
his “hardness” and “cynicism.” By stres-
sing Hamlet’s arrogant and brutal
moments —his ruthlessness to Polonms
alive and dead, his somewhat casual
apology to Laertes —Madariaga does
something to correct the popular senti-
mental view which, as he says, has sym-
bolically as well as physically shaved
Hamlet’s beard. His essay may be read
in this respect as a kind of invigoration
of Bradley, who is' a little inclined. to
dwell nice-mindedly on Hamlet s nobxli y
and purity. *. f
But for a fundamental explanation or
the Hamlet mystery Bradley remains tne
only satisfying authority. If Hamlet is,
to a degree, “egocentric” Bradley ca
tell us why he became so: the shock ne
has suffered drives him in upon himseu
and makes him, in moods when his inn
torment is most violent, look upon
outside world with arrogance, hostile
or indifference. He is Shakspeare s p
ture of a man who has been paralysed
by the horror of mankind at its worst,
as Prosper© is his picture of a man .
treats the Calibans with the contemp
they deserve.

A few particulars about Lord Howe
Island ?
Situated about 436 miles north-east
of Sydney, it has an area of 3220
acres, The climate is mild and rain-
fall abundant, but on account of the
rocky formation of its surface only
about 300 acres are suitable for culti-
vation, most of which are devoted
to the production of Kentia palm-
seed. The land belongs to the Crown
and is occupied rent-free on suffer-
ance. Discovered in 1788, the island
was first settled by a small party of
Maoris in 1853; afterwards a colony
was settled from Sydney. The island
is a dependency of N.S.W. and is
included in the State electorate of
King. A Board of Control at Syd-
ney manages the affairs of the island
and supervises the palm-seed industry.
Population, about 150.

(1) and (2) There was no Aust.
Light Horse unit in the Boer War.
They were known as (a) N.S.W.
Lancers, (6) 1st Aust. Horse, (c)
Mounted Rifles, ( d) Bushmen and
(e) Commonwealth Horse, (a) con-
sisted of one squadron under Capt.
C. F. Cox and sailed from England,
where they had been on a military
tournament, on Oct. 10, 1899, arriving
at Capetown on Nov. 2. They were
reinforced by drafts on the Kent,
Moravian and Australian from
N.S.W., arriving at Capetown on
Dec. 1, 1899, Feb. 18, 1900, and
March 19, 1900. (6), the 1st Aust.
Horse, comprised two contingents,
arriving at Capetown on Dec. 13,
1899, and Feb. 23, 1900. The strength
of this unit was not more than 140,
under the command of Capt, R. R.
Thompson, (c), (d) and (e) all left
Sydney during 1900, 1901 and 1902,
and each served for a maximum term
of one year, the late units for only
short periods until peace was pro-
claimed on May 31, 1902. (3) There
was no Australian general in supreme
command; each unit was attached to
British Army Commands; the most
senior Australian officers were lieut.-
colonels, who were on staff duties or
in command of light columns.

Are rose-trees budded on brier stock
better than those grown from cut-
tings? What is the reason for bud-
ding ?
Roses grown on brier stock will
always give better results than those
struck from cuttings, are stronger, and
will withstand weather under adverse
conditions. The flowering is better,
and should it be necessary fo shift
them the roses are less likely to be
affected by the change. The reason
for budding is that a wider range of
varieties can be more easily handled,
and if necessary more than one
budded on the same stock.

A RHYME OF WINTER.
Deuced unpleasant are
Chilblains and corns
When out of bed early
On cold winter moms,
When Jack Frost nips

The flaps of your ears
And point of your nose.
I dread the winter
With its frosts and rain
And glad when warm
Summer is back again.


COME OUT, BEAR
BY J.H.
MELVILLE
< < /* OME out, little bear.”
I Softly entreating, Mrs. Seelye-
V i Hunt crooned into the moon-
haze struck from the oaks be-
hind Barnford’s cottage.
A child hung whining round her
waist:
“A great big bear, Mother. I saw it
pawing the ground.”
“Come out, big bear, for Wanda,”
Mrs. SeelyerHunt called, and, startled by
the shrillness of her cry, held a pose of
birdlike anxiety, eyes and ears alert.
But the stream track was deserted.
Back on the highway a girl on horse-
back showed up in a motor-cycle’s head-
light. Guffaws and squeals of laughter
drifted faintly back, and among the wil-
lows a bucket-chain dangling over the
ruins of a sewage plant chattered un-
ceasingly.
“Bears in the trees,” she cried suddenly,
urged by a spirit of playful mockery.
PULLING her fur coat tight round
her, she crouched low and went
creeping out into the shadows. Her mood
was jubilant. She was on her way home
from the prizegiving, where she’d held
the stage as Mayoress. For once she’d
been free from file shame of her hus-
band’s pomposity—Mayoral duties had
taken Donald Seelye-Hunt elsewhere.
The body of the hall had been only dimly
lighted, and, with her play on the “sym-
pathetic” and the “classic” profile, she
had lorded it sweetly over a blur of faces
hobbling away into musty corners. She
was moving through the trees now with
high-stepping menace:
“Prow-ling. Prow-ling. Prow-ling.”
The child Wanda was dragged
stumbling behind, raked and spiked by
the undergrowth. Her passage through
moonlit places, cosy as’ they looked, was
nonetheless stinging. Piqued, she struck
out with a doll prize she carried.
“I did so see a bear. And I know
where it went.”
“Away over the tree-tops,” shrilled
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt.
She rejoiced at the child’s discovery.
A fallen branch, a pattern of foliage in
the moonlight, whatever made her
daughter’s bear she hailed it gladly. Her
little Wanda had the gift of imagination.
It was in imaginative perception, she
knew, that refinement lay, and refine-
ment was what she most fervently wished
her child.
SHE herself courted sensibility with a
kind of nervous expectancy, attuned
always to the precious and exotic, but
except for glimmerings of melancholy
awareness when the sun was going down,
enlightenment was denied her. Her quest
was, in fact, at times most disheartening;
there had been the vexation of thrilling
to the sweep of a scythe-blade in the sun,
only to find later that the mower on the
hill-face had been an uncouth, foul-
mouthed creature from the stables. But
the fulfilment she’d sought in vain was
being granted to her child. Wanda’s
fancy had run to a bear in Barnford’s
oaks. A bear pawing the ground.
The wonder of it would make a proud
tale to take home. She would tell it as
rejection of the Seelye-Hunt dourness.
“Nonsense!” would be Donald’s judg-
ment, arrived at probably with all the
solemnity of a matchstick twiddled in
one of his fleshy ears—attention to both
ears was reserved for civic affairs and
couldn’t be expected. And the Seelye-
Hunt aunts, a pair of brusque, rawboned
women who marched about together and
could lay concrete with as little fuss as
they turned out their own dowdy clothes,
would echo “Nonsense!”
She would take special joy from their
scoffing, for the fear that her Wanda
should grow up to be like one of these
marching aunts haunted her. The threat
was there —the broad head and the sleepy,
heavy-lidded eyes—but she strove to dis-
regard it. Seeing them tie back her
daughter’s hair in harsh imitation of their
own she would hide her aversion and
trump up most improbable reasons for
the child’s acquiescence.
THE measure of this dreaded Seelye-
Hunt corruption was made clear
during their Sunday car outings, trips on
which her husband, Donald, planted
solidly behind the wheel, would dawdle
along autocratically while from the back
seat the big women farmed the country-
side. There were frequent stops, and she
was distressed then to see her daughter
ape the marching aunts’, trooping out
after them to inspect the most trivial
changes of scene. Not that she wouldn’t
have conceded this to have heard the
child’s breath quicken at the rearing vista-
of the gorge, but a broken culvert
counted for more.
Resentful and helpless, she felt herself
nudged aside from an alliance that
baffled her. She’d tried hard to find a
way of compromise .with the big women.
Their sense of humor was no more im-
aginative than a smug pride in tradition.
Jokes were heirlooms. “We’re just wait-
ing to be struck by lightning,” they
would laugh when asked about their
catarrh —an allusion to a Seelye-Hunt
grandfather’s story of a Derbyshire
farmer who had been thus cured. She
sensed gloating in their talk of lightning,
as if some elemental sort of immunity
favored them. Her own style of humor,
tried out when she’d first come to the
homestead, was a kittenish mock-prudery
she’d been obliged to use defensively at
the bank where she’d worked. The re-
sponse of the marching women had been
bleak.
Their stolid self-assurance oppressed
her. Only once had she seen them wilt,
and for that she thought kindly of a
woman who had screamed abuse at them
so effectively from a cliff-top house that
the big women, who with Donald were
inspecting a patch of ragwort, had
crawled silently back into the car. The
memory of it pleased her, but it was of
little use as an example. She was too
keenly aware of her own inadequacy.
Sometimes she gave way to despair, and
the store she set by temperament was
then just a sham, a pose to offset the
Seelye-Hunt dominance. Then, too, her
ambition for her child would be only
the wish to see herself reflected, and its
purpose to satisfy a hunger for kindred
affection.
BUT the romance of Wanda’s bear
had dispelled all doubts. No Seelye-
Hunt had ever seen an oak-tree, by
moonlight or otherwise, as anything but
so much timber and firewood. She wel-
comed its advent with a touch of rakish
hysteria as she moved deeper into the
trees.
“Away with the wind,” she shrilled.
“Gone away over the treetops.”
She was heedless of the child’s doll
being thumped more urgently against
her back.
“Don’t go!” the child was protesting.
“It’s there! Don’t go!”
She swung the doll up into her
mother’s face.
“Oh, my glasses.” Mrs. Seelye-Hunt
dropped to her knees. “You naughty
child, you’ve knocked off mother’s
glasses.” Kneeling, she scratched blindly
through grass and fallen leaves. “You
bad, bad girl.”
She felt the glasses under hand. Then
suddenly she crumpled under the weight
of her daughter falling across her
shoulders. She couldn’t speak. A bangle
was pressed tightly against her throat.
She shook the child off with a spasm of
near-panic, but before she had time to
utter more than a startled “Wanda! ” she
was charged again and fell in a fierce
embrace. But this time she felt terror-
stricken trembling against her cheek.
“It’s there, it’s there, it’s there,” the
child was sobbing out.
O HATCHING clinging debris away,
*■—' she put on her glasses and, kneeling
there in the moonlit clearing, peered
about until she saw a squat, greyish
creature shambling through the deeper
shadows. She showed no alarm, but
gripped her daughter more firmly and
began to edge away. Her movement was
as deceptively smooth as a crablike
motion and her burden would allow.
She even caught herself humming a
comforting tune. In a strangely detached
way this pleased her. She fancied for a
moment that she heard hoofbeats, but no
horseman came riding along the stream
track. The sound was gone again, and
there was only the bucket-chain’s chatter
in the willows. The bear, she saw with
relief, had stopped short of the clearing.
She tingled to the charge of nervous
energy that was to carry them both to
safety.
Then came a few words from the bear,
spoken in the strident, nasal voice of an
old woman:
“Well I never, I thought you was her
ladyship.”
“Her ladyship.” Mrs. Seelye-Hunt
could only echo the words stupidly. In a
moment pr two she was vaguely aware
of little Wanda sniffling in her ear.
'“lt’s the dirty pig-woman,” the child
was whispering:
“What’s the girjie say?” the old woman
asked.
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt scrambled to her feet.
“Why, it’s Mrs. Harnbee,” she exclaimed,
straining so wildly after composure as
to raise to a ludicrous height the joy of
meeting old Lai Harnbee there. She
laughed unsteadily. “I lost my glasses.”
The old woman laughed with her, a tan-
talising laugh that left her guessing.
“I thought you was her ladyship,” the
old woman said again. “Sarah Barnford,
you know, from the cottage. There’d be
trouble if she found me here.”
“It was the pig-woman I saw,” mur-
mured little Wanda, dourly pleased.
“What’s the girlie say?”
MRS. SEELYE-HUNT was ready now
to snatch at anything as a sacrifice to
dignity. “Little Wanda thought you were
a bear,” she said, easing her ingratiating
way with mockery. .
Old Lai chuckled. “Goodness me, girlie,
a fine bear I’d make.”
“She was pawing the ground,” the child
maintained.
The old woman came lumbering down
the bank. “What’s the girlie say?”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt gave a condescend-
ing giggle. “She says you were pawing
the ground,” she said.
“And so I was, little girl. That’s just
what X was doing, pawing the ground.
You couldn’t say it better than that.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt said, “Fancy that.”
“No, I couldn’t say it better than that
myself,” the old woman said, and began
sliding round them strangely. She was
doubled over. One arm was bent to hold
a leather bag, and at intervals she stopped
shuffling to pivot on her left foot while
with the other she reached out arcwise.
Over her fat round face a plume from
her hat waved amiably, and a brooch the
size of a bantam’s egg glowed at her
throat. Her bulk swelled and shrank as
she moved through the changing light.
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt had begun to edge away
again and the child was plucking at her
coat. Then, tapping the ground with her
out-thrust foot, the. old woman stooped
and began to gather acorns into her bag.
She tapped again and stood erect, pant-
ing.
“It’s the way I pick up a few acorns
for my pigs when I happen to be passing
of a night,” she explained, proud of her
accomplishment.
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt, happily reassured,
murmured, “Fancy that.”
“I was just taking a jar of pickles down
to the vicarage,” the old woman went
on, “so I thinks I’ll just keep on my
slippers and pick up a few acorns on
my way home,”
“Fancy.”
“Oh, it’s just practice,” old Lai said
modestly. “Maybe the soles of my feet
is more tender than some, but I’m sure
the little girl could do it, too.” /
Mrs, Seelye-Hunt welcomed this diver-
sion. “I’m sure she could. You just show
Mrs. Harnbee, Wanda,”
“I don’t want to.”
“Right foot out,” coaxed Mrs. Seelye-
Hunt, lunging forward with an elegant
breaststroke action, her head high
“Slide, slide and —there, you see, mother’s
found one already.” She picked up an
acorn and dropped it into the old woman's
bag.
Old Lai grunted approval. “You’d do
good in slippers.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt was encouraged by
this praise. She giggled and began to
slither about in earnest, making a genteel
show of dropping each acorn singly in the
old woman’s bag.
The child stood sulkily aloof.
“You see what mother can do.”
Lai Harnbee laid her hand on the
younger woman’s shoulder. “I don’t want
to be getting you into trouble,” she said
quietly.
“Trouble?”
“Ah, yes, it’s her ladyship in there.
She’d set the dog on me if she caught me
gathering her acorns. I daren’t touch
them in the. daytime.”
MRS. SEELYE-HUNT stood non-
plussed, “But I always thought
Miss Barnford was such a sweet old
thing,” she said, subtly inviting any on-
slaught on that woman’s character. She
was uncertain of the wisdom of leaving.
She felt the need of dignity yet to be
retrieved. A place won in the old
woman’s goodwill, she hoped, would be
a safeguard against an embarrassing re-
port on the evening ; Lai’s street parades,
waddling from one gossiping crony to
the* next, were notorious,
“She’s a terror to hold a grudge against
you.” Old Lai chuckled. “You wouldn’t
remember that rumpus in the old days?”
“No.”
“I took the schoolmaster away from
her,” the old woman said proudly, “and
them engaged to be married.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt was incredulous. “I
had no idea. Mr. Harnbee a school-
master.”
“Good heavens!” Old Lai began to
shake all over. She seemed to be fight-
ing against outright laughter, the reason
being apparent when a moment or two
later she lost her breath in a bout of
wheezing. She wrapped her arms round
a tree-trunk and gave way, rolling over

Old Age, If Any.
When to old age, if any, I may come —
That will be the queer, the, grey,
diminishing journey
Where the blood aches along the veins,
all hungers cease,
When all delectable things I’ve seen and
done
Are ranged on memory’s shelves just out
of reach.
When the speech thickens and the will
to race
Stumbles and falters to an inching pace,
When actions to inaction sadly flow.
Having lived too much, be somewhat glad
to go ?
Feel the slow-beating pulse no drum of
doom ?
Thunder of bees about the box in bloom ?
Pray I remember in those cabined days
It was with too much riches I was poor.
Hard as the barren gullies score
A desolate country avid in the heat,
The teasing trifles thread across the
mind —
Torment and beauty, colors livid, harsh.
Storm and disaster gently level down
To this low weed upon the samphire
marsh.
While, eagled under granite rises,
Truth sits in tented wind,
A core of stillness.
When thief from theft is fleeing.
Murder lacks knives to hone.
Eye but burns dim from seeing,
As face wears back to bone.
So for the fallen weep no more.
The lion-heart or mouse.
No crows of despair can pick him bare —
Though the ants are under his house.

Battle of Berlin.
Reports sent out by corres-
pondents on the spot suggest
that the Russian aim of a united
Germany, Communist - bossed
and therefore another —it would
be far the greatest—Soviet satel-
lite, is not only nowhere in sight
but is utterly fantastic.
Since the London decisions
setting up Western Germany as
a working concern that won’t
be a millstone for ever round the
neck of the conquerors there
has been, practically all reports
agree, a strong rise of German
national feeling. That in this
there ig no love for them
amongst the bulk of Berliners
the Russians can thank their
resort to starvation as a “cold-
war” weapon. That there is no
love for them amongst the bulk
of Germans altogether they can
thank the vile brutalities com-
mitted by their Red Army, after
the then-appeasing Americans
and British withdrew from Ger-
man territory and gave them a
free hand.
Drew Middleton, of N. Y.
“Times,” has reported from
Berlin an increased “strength
and depth of feeling against the
Soviet Union,” not only in the
Western zones but in besieged
Berlin. On the rise of German
national feeling during the past
weeks, Middleton emphasises
that this is not to be confused
with the “ersatz” variety manu-
factured by the Communists,
whose “vision of a unified Ger-
many is one which always in-
cludes a close alliance with the
‘Great Socialist Motherland,’ the
Soviet Union,”
The same correspondent re-
ports that the majority of Ger-
mans do not want that sort of
Germany. “And persistent em-
phasis by the Communists on
the closeness of the future alli-
ance between their projected all-
German Government and the
Soviet Union is another reason
for their fall in popularity.
Never has Soviet prestige and,
consequently, the prestige of the
Socialist Unity party in the
Eastern zone and the Communist
party in the Western zones been
lower.”
Despite all that, however, the
position is not without some
points of doubt for the future —
the French fears of a resurgent
Germany being not altogether
groundless. As the N. Y.
“Times” correspondent reports
them, the Germans, although
they look to the West for eco-
nomic and political sustenance,
are reaching the point where
they want to see the end of any
occupation, “even one which on
the whole has been as tolerant as
that of the Americans and
British.” This is, he insists, be-
cause they retain a deep Ger-
manic belief in their own Reich
and because they feel that once
the occupation fqrces have been
withdrawn Germany ig less
likely to be the scene of an ideo-
logical struggle.
But whatever meaning the rise
of German nationalism may
have for the future, it has
strongly served the Western side
in the Battle of Berlin. The
stand has been made possible by
two main factors —“the bitter
resistance of the Germans them-
selves” a g.a in s t the Soviet
starvation weapon, and “the
enormous extent of the United
States and British air-lift,” giv-
ing the Germans a taste of food
and the Russians a foretaste of
what could happen if the planes
had to carry another sort of
load —a little further.
The Two Germanys.
The essential figures of the
two parts of partitioned Ger-
many, drawn from an article in
N. Y. “Times”:
Western Germany. Occupied
by 115,000 American, 70,000
British, 50,000 French troops.
Area, 95,800 square miles;
population, 45,000,000, Ac-
counted for 86 per cent, of Ger-
many’s pre-war production of
steel, 80 per cent, of its coal, 61
"Echo der Woche” ( Munich, Germany).
“IF YOU EAT ME. I’LL TELL MY BROTHER IN AMERICA
WHO HAS A GUN.”
per cent, of its industrial pro-
ducts, 45 per cent, of its food.
Eastern Germany. Occupied
by 300,000 Soviet troops. Area,
46,000 square miles; population,
17,000,000. Accounted for 1.4
per cent, of pre-war Germany’s
steel, 20 per cent, of its coal, 39
per cent, of its industrial pro-
ducts, 55 per cent, of its food.
Doubtful France.
Looking into just what is the
position of France in the Wes-
tern Powers v. Soviet crisis,
“Wall-street Journal’s” able
European correspondent Joseph
E. Evans finds that it is not to
be explained simply by French
fears of yet another attack by
Germany.
“The French reluctance to
play along with other Western
Allies in their plans for Ger-
many,” Evans insists, “is based
primarily not on fear of Ger-
man aggression but on fear of
Soviet aggression.”?
U.S. General Clay, on whom,
says Evans, no love is lost in
France, “is evidently of the
opinion that the presence of the
American Army of Occupation
in Germany suffices as a mili-
tary guarantee for France
against Russian expansion, a
concept the French are under-
standably at a loss to grasp. It
is at any rate of the first im-
portance to know just what the
French point of view is.
“In the first place, more than
one-tenth of the population of
France is Communist, a Soviet
fifth-column of truly prodigious
proportions. It doesn’t take much
imagination to calculate how
long it would be before France
would be occupied in the event
of East-West hostilities. Even
aside from war, French policy-
makers figure it is only by the
skin of its teeth their country is
not fight now in the position of
Czechoslovakia, and they are far
from thinking of that danger in
the past tense.
“They saw last winter what
the Communists could do in the
way of paralysing the economy,
and they had another bitter taste
of it much more recently at
Clermont-Ferrand [and in the
savage outbreak next-door, in
Italy]. The not-recently-
paralleled violence of Clermont-
Ferrand was a pretty good indi-
cation of the Communist mood,
and, what is more important, the
basic issue of Clermont-Ferrand
—the wage-price spiral—is as far
as ever from being solved, so
that for the predictable future
industrial peace in France must
remain in the realm of dreams.
That problem has not been coped
with, and the Communists are
the ones who will gain thereby.”
As in the case of the past
German threats', Evans points
out that the Soviet Union ap-
pears larger and more belligerent
to French eyes than to Ameri-
can or even British. “All that
separates the Red Army from
France is a very few hundred
miles of America’s Germany,
guarded by the American Army
of Occupation. But surely not
even General Clay or any other
responsible military leader seri-
ously believes his three divisions,
more or less, alone or in con-
junction with those of the other
two Western Occupation
Powers, could hold off the Red
Army once it started.”
In the writer’s view, the
French “may well inquire what
they are getting for their own
protection.”
Uncle Sam Rearms.
As well as keeping practically
on a war-basis the big fleets
totalling 763 ships, with another
1970 (including 664 major com-
bat vessels) in reserve (B.
21/7/’485, Uncle Sam is strongly
rearming in all other defence
sectors; to be a bit more than
ready, in case.
The preparedness figures, as
analysed by N. Y. “Times” mili-
tary writer Hanson W. Baldwin,
show Army strength being in-
creased insMe the next 12
months from 548,000 to 790,000
men (the President can make a
call-up to ensure that total);
Navy to 434,675 ;
Marines to 89,225; Air Force
to 444,500; a total standing
strength of 1,758,400 extra-
ordinary in peace-time.
Along with these increases
there will be more-active war-
training. Also, the U.S. Navy’s
operating air fleet —some 5800
active aircraft, 2100 of them
operating from the 20 carriers
in commission—will be aug-
mented inside the next 12
months by some 2000 planes
used by the Naval Reserve. New
procurements will replace obso-
lescent types with new planes,
particularly v jet - fighters. The
ultimate Navy goal is 14.500
planes—jets and other new post-
war types.
The U.S. Navy’s ship-con-
struction programme includes
“the world’s largest ship”—a
65,000-ton flush-deck carrier—
and new specialised ships.
The U.S. Air Force is already
embarked on a big new pro-
gramme, involving many long-
range high-speed types. It ex-
pands from 55 regular operat-
ing groups to 70 groups in the
regular forces, plus 27 groups in
the Air National Guard and a
further 34 groups in the Air
Reserve, with additional separate
squadrons—a grand total of
about 138 groups of their
equivalent, or more than 20,500
planes. Biggest operating in-
crease will be in long-range very
heavy bombers, which will in-
crease from about 480 to 720.
The new Boeing 850 will gradu-
ally replace the 829 as “work-
horse” of the strategic bomber
fleet.
Always remembering already
big stocks of the atom bomb, it
adds up to a standing strength
calculated to scare off all but
lunatics.
American Circus.
Politicians everywhere; large
and small; If you have tears
(which some narks doubt), pre-
pare to shed them now! Henry
Wallace has not only been draw-
ing capacity houses on his U.S.
Presidential electioneering, but
they’ve been paying good money
(and bad) to hear him!
They should pay, too; for,
as Luke P. Carroll, N. Y.
“Herald Tribune” correspon-
dent who’s been on tour with
him, describes it: “The Henry
A. Wallace road show, featur-
ing the Billy Sunday of the poli-
tical world and including an
assorted group of fund-raisers
extraordinary who double as
comedians, legitimate stage per-
formers who ‘warm up’ the
audience, and scientists who in-
stil in the minds of their listeners
a shuddering fear of the next,
war, is by far the top troupe
now touring the country.”
Capacity crowds, Carroll re-
ports, greet the performers at
every stop. Then, after shelling
out from ten cents to $2.40 each
to get in—the price depends on
the town —they are exhorted to
contribute to the campaign fund
during a special collection. They
always respond, “tossing cheques
and pledges into milk-cans and
waving greenbacks.” ;
From what Carroll describes
as a typical audience of about
16,000, the travelling" circus ex-
tracted “between $15,000 and
$20,000, a fistful of worthless
Chinese currency and five lots in
St. Louis county just outside
Duluth.” In the show on that
occasion were, apart from Wal-
lace himself, “William Gailmor,
a glib radio commentator who
makes the ‘touch’ [that is, puts
the nips in]; Canada Lee, an
actor who has had marked suc-
cess both on Broadway and in
Hollywood; and Dr. Maurice
Visscher, of the University of
Minnesota, and national chair-
man of the American Associa-
tion of Scientific Workers, an
organisation which he said is a
subdivision of the National
Association for the Advancement
of Science.”
Ushers, “usually students who
favor thick eyeglasses,” are re-
cruited and briefed on the part
they play in the collection ; pic-
tures of Mr. Wallace and the
late President Roosevelt are
stretched around the hall, and
experts prepare the lighting
effects which are used to drama-
tise the show.
Then the show gets going:
“First of the troupe to appear
on the bare stage is Mr. Lee.
Employing the stage presence
he has acquired in his many
years before the footlights, he
goes all out to impress upon the
audience the seriousness of the
need for a-Messiah to lead a
world drifting apart. No light
touches, no banter, in any line
uttered by Mr. Lee, and when
he finishes his thirty-minute spiel
the audience is well aware that
a monumental crisis exists today
—a crisis that can be resolved
only by electing Mr. Wallace
President of the United States.”
After Mr. Lee, Dr. Visscher,
to deliver “a stern warning on
the future,” the “almost in-
describable horrors of atomic
and biological warfare” in
which “every citizen will be in
the first line of trenches.”
“With the audience figuratively
sitting ©n the edge of their chairs
listening for an atomic blast,”
Mr. Gailmor takes the spotlight.
“Suave, perhaps a bit too
polished,” he picks up where the
previous speakers had stopped
and for a few minutes discusses
in general terms the programme
of “peace and prosperity” offered
by the new political party. Then
the fund-raiser gets down to
business.
“The ihoney you give,” he tells
the audience, “is more than a
mere political donation. It’s a
form of life insurance.” Mr.
Gailmor asks for individual
donations; the size of these de-
pending on the ske of the town,
says Carroll (or perhaps, cynics
might think, on feelers put out
beforehand). Anyhow, the nip
might be for as high as $1000;

keeps on scaling down to what-
ever he thinks is the most any
one person will offer —say, $25.
At one meeting, says the re-
porter, “When there was a lag
in donations, Mr. Gailmor
would turn to the many ushers
in the aisles and direct them to
‘attack the prey.’ And when an
usher would run to the stage
with a particularly interesting
donation —possibly an unexpec-
ted substantial offer or maybe a
‘pay-cheque’ donated by a union
member Mr. Gailmor would
stretch out his hands and say T
love you all. I’m going to move
from Westchester to live with
you.’
“Then, down to asking for one-
dollar contributions, Mr. Gail-
mor would call upon all in the
audience to wave a dollar bill in.
the air ‘just so the newspaper
photographers can get a shot of
how you feel about this move-
ment.’ There was no photo-
grapher available at the Duluth
meeting, but he went ahead any-
way. Then, laughing as if en-
joying a huge joke, he ordered
the ushers to get the dollar bills
—and they did get many.
“But that’s not all. As Gail-
mor walks off the stage he pre-
tends to hear change rattle and
dashes back to the microphone.
The cause is so compelling and
the need so great, he says, that
the ‘Wallace-for-President com-
mittee is willing to accept loose
change.’ The ushers, armed
with containers or baskets, re-
appear and march up and down
the aisles until Mr. Gailmor is
satisfied that not another penny
can be had. Then, and only
then, does the crowd get to see
the star performer.”
This is the dramatic climax
(perhaps Mr. Ward* say, might
like to try it): “The hall is
darkened. A spotlight wanders
over to a door, and soon a man
with an unruly forelock and a
toothy grin strides on to the
stage. He reads his prepared
speech with little animation.
And when he makes a paren-
thetical aside, the chuckle that
follows seems to frighten him,
for he immediately gets back to
the business at hand. .
“While the ovations are few
and far between, he is always
well received. Deadly serious
about his crusade, his sincerity is
apparent to all. And the audi-
ence, whether composed of stu-
dents, farmers or working men,
is as serious as Mr. Wallace.
When he finishes, he waves once
or twice and marches off the
stage, leaving behind an audi-
ence thoroughly satisfied with
what they have seen and heard.”
Quite a good show, even by
American Presidential standards
in general; yet it could be im-
proved, and without going out-
side Mr. Wallace’s own “party.”
Mr. Wallace’s team-mate. Sena-
tor Glen H. Taylor, would evi-
dently be an attraction in his
own right anywhere.
At any rate, referring to him
as the son of “a preacher of
some description who used to
exhort the more or less faithful
to give up their ginning and
wenching in the mining camps of
Idaho,” N. Y. “Daily News” has
said of the Senator: “Reaching
man’s estate some 22 years ago
[he’s now 43], he became known
presently as the Crooning Cow-
boy or the Singing Cowboy—-
the record is not clear as to
which it was —and the Taylor
number that never failed to roll
’em in the aisles was a rendition
of ‘Yes, We Have No Bananas’
in Chinese.
Tito's Flop.
At present in America for the
good of his health (like many
another one-time resident of the
Soviet paradise and its environs),
Tito’s former information chief,
Bogdan Raditsa, has explained,
in N. Y. “World-Telegram,” his
old boss’s fall from grace.
The Kremlin anathema pro-
nounced on Tito, declaring him
anti-Soviet, sympathetic to the
West and otherwise null and
void, in Raditsa’s account merely
cloaks the real story. Tito, he
declares, tried hard to make
good in his mission to mould
Yugoslavia into a “little Russia.”
He tried, says Raditsa, “by the
most ruthless methods he could
muster.”
What beat him in that aim
was “the stubborn, fierce nature
of the Croats and Serbs, the
dominant peoples of Yugo-
slavia.” And the fall from
Kremlin grace was no surprise:
Tito had been tottering since
last March, “when a split within
the Communist party in Yugo-
slavia began to widen.”
Raditsa even casts doubt on
Tito’s belonging to the country
at all; suggesting that actually
he’s a Russian: “He speaks
BuffalO “Evening News” ( U.S.A. ).
POOR TITO!
Croatian with a strong Russian
accent.”
The chief snag Tito’s Com-
munising encountered was “the
peasantry, who form the back-
bone of Yugoslavia ....the
Communists have admitted
complete failure to get the pea-
santry working actively for the
five-year plan.”
Malay Guerrillas.
In a London “Times” letter
Air Chief-Marshal J. B. Joubert,
looking at the murders of
planters by the local brand of
Corns in Malaya, sees a return-
ing boomerang:
“During the Japanese occupa-
tion the only effective guerrillas
in Malaya were the Chinese
Communists. These were the
thugs and bandits among an
otherwise peaceful and law-
abiding Chinese population
which suffered very severely at
Japanese hands. I believe that
H.Q., S.E.A.C., decided to sup-
port the Chinese Communist
guerrillas, and I do not doubt
that the Sten-guns used to
murder inoffensive British
planters were provided by us.
“The point is one for study
by the General and Air Staff as
well as by politicians. Whereas
it may be expedient and wise for
the weaker side (as we were in
1942-43) to foment sedition and
provoke and supply guerrilla
warfare in an occupied, civilised
and patriotic community, it is
very doubtful if the small ad-
vantage gained by the same
policy in countries such as
Burma and Malaya outweighs
the consequences that follow on
the reoccupatiorl of territory.”
Synthetic Rubber.
Though not exactly stated, the
scale (and effect) of U.S. syn-
thetic-rubber production is indi-
cated in a brisk exchange be-
tween Sir John Hay, chairman
of a British natural-rubber con-
cern, and N. Y. “World-Tele-
gram’s” financial editor.
Wrote Sir John: “Our Ameri-
can friends’ devotion to the sys-
tem of private enterprise and
free competition is not so un-
qualified as to prevent them
from departing from it when it
seems to serve their interests to
do so. Synthetic rubber has
been put under the shelter of
protective legislation well be-
yond the reach of the cold, blast-
ing winds of free competition.”
The American didn’t deny it,
but smacked back: “It is easy
to understand Sir John’s disap-
proval of our synthetic-rubber
programme. It upsets the
monopoly which his company
and others enjoyed in the
natural-rubber business, and pre-
vents them from charging ex-
orbitant prices for an essential
commodity because they do have
a monopoly. In other words, it
broke up a racket which had
cost American consumers mil-
lions of dollars in past years.”
Bolstering the £.
Commenting on British com-
plaint that “the U.S. objective
[related to the Marshall Plan]
is to make the dollar supreme,”
a New York “World-Telegram”
writer points out that “American
taxpayers have advanced billions
of dollars to bolster up the Eng-
lish pound.”
Also, “far from seeking to
‘capture’ the sterling area, the
U.S. is trying to help stabilise
the pound as well as other
foreign currencies. It knows
only too well that further chaos
in this field may wreck the thing
it hopes to do bring about
world recovery.”
Meanwhile, “because the
British pound is artificially
pegged at approximately $4, but
can be bought on the world
market at prices as low as $2,
Britain faces a serious sterling
crisis.”
These comments are typical
of general U.S. retorts to
British and other criticism of
European Recovery Programme
conditions, with the warning
that such criticism is likely to
lead to a drastic revision of the
amount of aid in the pro-
gramme’s second year, irrespec-
tive of who is elected U.S.
President,
The Scripps-Howard writer
on economic affairs, Lawrence
Fertig, says that, “to enforce
the artificial rate for the £,
British authorities have created
a tangled web of currency and
export regulations which are
very reminiscent of what
Finance Minister Hjal m a r
Schacht did in Hitler’s Germany.
Today there are five different
categories of pounds sterling —
each good for trade in some sec-
tion of the world.”
Fertig further comments: “It
will be a great day for the world
w'hen all the phony officially-
fixed prices for currency are
thrown on the scrap-heap. It
will be the beginning of a great
era for international trade and
commerce when the major world
currencies are permitted to sell
for what they are really worth.
Today practically every nation
in Europe is trying to fool every
other nation (as well as its own
people) by overvaluing its cur-
rency. The object, of course,
is to get high prices for pro-
ducts sold for export.”
Some Civilisation!
U.N.O. having, after much
solemn debate, come up with
an “international declaration of
human rights,” William Henry
Chamberlin comments in “ Wall-
street Journal” that perhaps its
most striking feature “is the
unfavorable mirror which it
holds up to our time,”
Most of the rights which are
enumerated in the declaration,
Chamberlin points out, were
taken for granted in most civi-
lised countries before the First
World War. “Nowhere, even
in countries which were con-
sidered politically and socially
backward 40 years ago, were
some of these rights blotted out
with the mechanical thorough-
ness so characteristic of totali-
tarian States today.
“The European who lived in
the period between the Franco-
Prussian War and the First
World War was pretty sure of
his right ‘to life, liberty and
security of person,’ Nor was
he liable to ‘slavery or involun-
tary servitude, to torture or to
cruel, inhuman and degrading
punishment.’ The right to leave
one’s own country and go else-
where for personal or political
reasons was not seriously ques-
tioned, and it was a rare event
when someone was arbitrarily
deprived of his property. Nor,
in most European countries, was
there any serious let or hin-
drance to ‘the right to freedom
of opinion and expression.’
“How drastically this situation
has changed today! Arbitrary
arrest, confiscation of property,
manufacture of opinion by
State propaganda-agencies have
become the rule, not the excep-
tion, in all lands east of the
‘iron curtain.’ It is both more
difficult and more dangerous to
leave the Soviet Union, without
Government consent, than it is
to get out of a reasonably well-
guarded jail or penitentiary.”
As for slavery and involuntary
servitude, Chamberlin quotes
excerpts on labor conditions in
the Kolyma goldmines of East-
ern Siberia from an article in
the sober, unsensational Lon-
don “Economist”;
“The convict slaves, who
form well over 90 per cent, of
the population of Dalstroy [the
Soviet State gold enterprise]
work under the ‘control of armed
guards and specially-trained dogs
and under the pressure of an
ingeniously devised system of
economic incentives. Norms of
work are fixed and the prisoner’s
rations are proportionate to the
percentage of the norm he
achieves each day. Refusal to
work is punished by death;
work less than 30 per cent, of
the norm is counted ,as refusal
and earns the same penalty.
Above the 30 per cent, mark
there are four grades of rations
for ordinary workers and a
special ration for ‘shirkers’; the
shirkers’ ration and the lowest
of the regular rations are quite
insufficient to maintain life if
continued for any length of
time, and only the best and
hardest work earns anything like
adequate nourishment. All
those who wish, to remain alive,
therefore, struggle to reach the
higher ration grades ; those who
fail over a period of days or
weeks rapidly weaken and die
or are finished off by the guards.
lnsubordination is requited
with death or with cruel punish-
ments often fatal to the victim.”
“In the truly liberal age be-
fore the First World War,”
Chamberlin comments, “charges
of inhumanity in the procure-
ment of rubber in the Belgian
Congo created an international
scandal; now the sufferings of
the victims of the Kolyma gold-
mines and the many other Soviet
slave-labor enterprises go almost
unnoticed in a world that has
become callous from the horrors
it has witnessed.”
A most amazing part of it all,
overlooked by Chamberlin and
most other commentators, is the
way admirers of the Soviet slave-
State particularly some pro-
fessed churchmen —can condone
such foul horrors, without sign
of even a twinge of conscience.

Governor Warren. U.S. Vice-
Presidential team-mate of Dewey,
California’s Governor Warren has a
tough, and a grim, background. His
parents were Norwegian immigrants,
and while he was still a boy his father
was murdered. Jhe young Warren
had to make his own way from the
beginning, working at solid toil and
from it paying for his own education.
Warren’s eventual success is summed
up briefly by a London “Times”
U.S. correspondent: “He has run for
many offices since the end of the first
World War without ever being de-
feated.”

Eire Aid. —Costello, Prime Minister
of Eire, on the new agreement under
which Eire will provide increased
supplies of cattle, bacon, etc., to the
United Kingdom: “We do not wish
to take advantage of your present
necessities. Continental buyers are
offering in Dublin prices for our fat
cattle far in excess of the prices at,
which we have agreed to sell them
to Great Britain. We could get in
return for those cattle goods which
we very much need, and from Bel-
gium we could also get hard currency.
But we have given up that advantage
for the sake of making a long-term
agreement with Great Britain.”

Jew Against Jew. Even if there
was no fighting against Arabs there
might still not be peace in Israel.
The Jewish groups which took over
power when the British withdrew are,
as Washington “Post” reports, be-
devilled by the terrorist faction within
their midst. The majority group in
control of’the Government is eager
to work with the United Nations and
in effecting peaceful, relations with the
Arabs. But the extremist Irgun Zvai
Leumi apparently has no such inten-
tions. The terrorists have “set Jew
against Jew in the Holy Land.”

Wanted, Salesmen. —As reported by
London “Times,” President of the
Board of Trade Wilson regards the
days of easy selling as definitely over.
“In future the extent to which Britain
can sell goods abroad will no longer
be limited by production but by
methods of salesmanship and the
attention paid to the needs of foreign
markets.” Selling, he said, “is a
most acute and growing problem.”
Exporters, “intoxicated with the ease
with which they could sell their goods
abroad” and believing that “this con-
dition would last for ever,” had now
to realise that the fool’s paradise of
a “seller’s market” has vanished.
Sentiments which probably don’t
apply only to Britain.

WARNING TO LIBERALS.
In the way of politics nothing could be
sillier than the exhibition which the
Sydney “Labor” Premier made of himself
and party during the Kogarah by-election
campaign, from start to finish and sequel.
Beginning with the assertion that the
coalminers had done and were doing
“very wonderful work,” which was tanta-
mount to a blind rubbing of salt into
wounds felt by every householder, flat-
dweller and roomer, Mr. McGirr passed
to hollow laudation of his “Government,”
in the result adding ridicule and contempt
to indignation, and from that to cheap
brag about the impending “victory.” His
candidate was certain to win and he him-
self would be ready on election-night with
a hearty handshake. Even when the
candidate was resigned to defeat, being
over 500 votes behind and only 1400 or
so to come in, the fatuous Premier saw
“victory” lurking in the remaining boxes.
And when the “Labor” majority of 3732,
registered so recently as May 3, 1947,
had been converted into a minority of
829, he blithered that “Labor” would
regain Kogarah in 1950, and with it
“Coogee, Lachlan, Orange, Albury,
Drummoyne and Lane Cove,” despite the
efforts of a press “notoriously divorced
from the interests of the people” which
had “excelled itself in the viciousness ot
its anti-Labor propaganda in order to
win the Kogarah seat for the vested in-
terests.”
As a politician since 1922 Mr. McGirr
should not be so foolish. Nor should
the Liberals match him by arguing
from by-election voting, as in their
elation they have chosen to do. Though
the capture *of Coogee and Kogarah is
naturally encouraging, it does not warrant
the assertion from Liberal H.Q. that if
McGirr and Chifley “Governments” had
to go to the country this year 20
Assemblymen and eight or nine, perhaps
10, N.S.W. Federal members would be de-
feated. It is not going to be so easy to
beat Administrations with large majorities
which can carry on for such a length of
time —14 months in one case and for
nearly two years in the other —and which,
it only because Parliamentary pay has
been heavily increased, will, in all proba-
bility, be untroubled by storms such as
wrecked the already-leaky “Labor” craft
in 1931-32.
A lot of water, dirty as it may be, will
flow under the bridge before the end of
next year. By that time, at the present
rate of increase, which the Opposition
has no means of arresting, there will be
at least 600,000 persons drawing Govern-
ment or “semi”-Government pay, con-
veniently distributed in vital metropolitan
constituencies. Probably 100,000 of these
persons fear that the Liberals will sack
them, if the Liberals can, so “Labor” is
assured of their support, and that of their
womenfolk and other members of their
families; and their support will give
“Labor” a big start. It will not be nearly
sufficient if the Opposition makes the
most of its opportunities; but, above all
things, the Opposition should resist and
master the temptation to believe that
nothing is required of it but destructive
criticism; that “Labor,” by its sins of
commission and omission, will beat itself.
That belief, too long persisted in, was the
undoing of the U.A.P.
It is a fair inference from the refer-
endum and by-election results that a great
many decent working people who pre-
viously voted the ticket are fed up with
“Labor” and bitterly hostile to the Com-
munists to whom the Chifleys and Mc-
Girrs crawl, and are thus in the mood to
accept deliverance from the Opposition.
But what does the Opposition propose?
The Country party has been consistent
in its resistance to the Communist con-
spiracy, though not precise enough as to
how it would scotch the foul thing. Its
allies have only recently abandoned the
notion that Moscow’s Fifth-column is
entitled to legal protection and should be
encountered only with the methods of
nineteenth-century Liberalism, which had
no Fifth-column to deal with. Even now,
though the Liberals would substitute for
legal protection a legal ban, they don’t
go nearly far enough. A ban could not
be wholly effective, as was shown in
1940-41, when Communists shot up as
“the State ‘Labor’ party” in N. S. Wales
and as “Independent Socialists” in
Queensland, and ran candidates with
these designations. Neither would con-
trolled union elections, which (partly be-
cause unionists have to choose between
Communists and A.L.P. men) they con-
tinue to win, nor secret ballots on strikes
do more than inconvenience them here
and there. All the weapons in their
armory of ruffianism, the chief of which
are insult, intimidation —extended to
workingmen’s wives—and sectarianism,
and, in small places, knowledge of how
everyone votes, would still be at the
service of the gang.
Yet the gang can be struck at through
the unions, even those used as instruments
of its wars against industrial arbitration,
the Australian people, their industries and
institutions, whole States (Queensland in
the most recent instance), the Dutch in
the N.E.I. and now the British in Malaya.
It could be hit hard by trade-union legis-
lation incorporating the best features of
the Taft-Hartley Act, which, to the con-
fusion of Communist union bosses and
the chagrin of others (by no means all),
has earned general acceptance among
loyal Americans, mainly for these
reasons:
As drafted by Senator Taft and his
associates and passed by Congress, the Act
set out “to protect the rights of individual
unionists in their relations with labor
organisations and to protect the rights of
the public in connection with labor dis-
putes affecting commerce, internal and over-
seas.” This it has done.
The measure safeguards unionists against
excessive dues and levies arbitrarily im-
posed and exacted, and, by the require-
ment of regular balance-sheets, secures
them against the expenditure of their funds
on Communist propaganda and other un-
worthy objects.
It refuses the use of the National Labor
Relations Board, a counterpart of our
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, though
with other important functions, to unions 0
and union branches with Communist
officials. All these organisations, some of
which, such as the A.F.L. and the C. 1.0.,
have millions of members, must certify by
affidavit that every official they employ “is
not a member of the Communist party or
affiliated with such party, and does not
believe in, and is not a member of or
supports any organisation that believes in
or teaches, the overthrow of the United
States Government by force or by any
illegal or unconstitutional methods.”
Here the Government at Washington
has gone further. It has arrested 10 Com-
munist-party leaders and is holding them
for trial on charges of plotting together
and working separately “to teach and
advocate the overthrow of the United
States Government by force and
violence.” Mr. Fadden has welcomed
this development. He should promise
similar action when the opportunity
comes to the Opposition, and so should
Mr. Menzies. They should also under-
take to apply the unrepealed Crimes Act
section (or to restore and enforce it if
repealed) which provides 12 months’ im-
prisonment for ruffians found guilty of
promoting “a serious industrial disturb-
ance prejudicing or threatening trade and
commerce with other countries and among
the States,” plus deportation if they were
“not born in Australia.” These under-
takings would put the fear of God in the
hearts of Communist wreckers, especially
Australia-hating immigrants who have
shown themselves traitors to their race.
And the Liberal and Country-party
leaders should say what they mean by
tax-reduction and be as precise and de-
tailed as can be fairly expected of them
as to what, if summoned to office, they
would do. Mr. Fadden has been giving
some homely, but very useful, illustrations
of thdf savage, and in some cases idiotic,
operation of sales-tax and excise. An
admitted authority on taxation matters,
he should be commissioned by both
parties to explore the whole field and
prepare a list of imposts which bear evilly
on the victims (such as the penal income-
tax clapped on thrifty old people past
earning, who get a specially reduced rate
in the U.S.A.), so that a specific reform
policy may be arrived at. There is
nothing like being specific in these
matters.
Berlin Not So Distant.
Mr. Chifley said after a look at the not-
so-cold-war front in Berlin: “We must
hold on. The Australian Govern-
ment fully approves the stand which the
Allies have taken.”
Then Mr. Chifley took wing home. En
route, in Malaya, he had a second-hand
report on another part of the same front,
in conversation with the British authori-
ties, who had already—and vainly—asked
Canberra to send a few tommy-guns for
defence of lonely planters against armed
Communist guerrillas. All Mr. Chifley
had to say from this quarter was that the
British Commissioner-General “believed
the situation could be brought under
control,” though he [Mr. Chifley] was
“not very happy about it.” But he has
still “deferred” the problem of sending
Australian arms to Malayan authorities.
Now Dr. Evatt has fled by air to
the fourth Test-match in England, on the
way to U.N.O. meetings in Geneva and
Paris in a few weeks’ time. What’s
Malaya to him, or he to Malaya? Or
the coming Bank Act judgment in the
High Court either? Or the possibility
that if Berlin blows up seriously the
leaders of a Soviet Fifth-column may
have to be rounded up in Australia as
already they are beginning to be in the
United States?
Quite unlikely that last, of course,
though those whom Mr. Chifley calls
merely “philosophers” here are agents of
the same destroyers of peace and recovery
whose “cold war” in Berlin appeared to
shake him. Through the unions they
have just collared afresh command of all
national transport services, and on the
slightest attempt from Canberra actively
to support Britain in Malaya they will —
as their current threats convey—tell the
“Government” exactly where it gets off.
Dr. Evatt, whose nine protracted trips
overseas since 1943 have not stiffened him
against Soviet Russia’s dirty games,
recently expounded “Australia’s foreign
policy” in a foreword to a composite
book by Australian war correspondents
entitled Near North : —
We must continue to develop a policy of
our own in relation to the Western Pacific
and South Asian countries whose
peoples are rapidly moving towards com-
plete self-government....
Our role lies, firstly, in an earnest en-
deavor to understand their problems and
needs; secondly, in discussing the best ways
of reciprocal help; thirdly, in carrying out
practical measures for such mutual assist-
ance.
In pursuing such a policy we shall bo
carrying out the pledges we have made
under the Atlantic Charter and United
Nations Charter... .We shall not prejudice
but strengthen both our close relationships
with the United States and our still closer
ties of kinship with Great Britain, of whose
responsibilities in... .South-east Asia Aus-
tralia is shouldering a considerable and
increasing share. Most important, we shall
safeguard our own national future in large
measure, because the existence of stable,
progressive, prosperous and democratically-
inclined Governments in Asia is funda-
mental to Australia’s own security.
Words without end, but never any accept-
ance of responsibility.
If the stand of the Western democracies
in Berlin, which excited Mr. Chifley’s
“full approval,” depended on the support
of the Australian “foreign policy,” the
Red Army would by now be destroying
all civilisation between the Oder and the
Atlantic,
Should the Berlin crisis lead to war, that
war will instantly appear as close to us
as Singapore and Sourabaya, and the
enemy will have his allies organised and
entrenched in Australia. It will not then
avail Our Foreign Policy that it has for
the past three years changed plumage in
in the course of every feeble flight, though
always with some cranky residual of
homing instinct —if it may be so called —
towards an anti-British roost, notably the
Russian.
The harsh facts of our situation today
are that:
The outstanding result of the Allies’
victory in the war was to knock down on
each side of Soviet Russia the two great
barriers which had kept Communism in
check —Germany in the west and Japan in
the east.
The British power, on which we could
always depend—whatever wayward “pangs
and inhibitions” might be evinced
by “Labor” —has been withdrawn from
most of far-eastern Asia, and from Burma,
India, Egypt and Palestine, and its status is
questioned at both ocean gates to our seas:
at the foot of Africa and the foot of South
America.
Membership of U.N.O. is supposed to
compensate for this deterioration. Never
has Dr. Evatt warned the country
in the terms of the changes above-
mentioned. So far as the public knows,
he has not learned the salient truth of
the Far Eastern question—that evergreen
cause of international strife —which is
that China does not rule, nor within
European memory has ever ruled, Man-
churia ; but rather Manchuria has
dominated China. That truth is at least
as old as the Great Wall. The late war
drove Japan out, only to place Russia in
possession, as Japan had previously re-
placed Russia; and if Japan itself is not,
as a result, to fall into the Russian maw,
then it must be made a barrier again
against aggressive Russian expansion.
Dr. Evatt knows, or accepts, nothing of
this. He has been perpetually pinpricking
and obstructing the American programme
in Japan. His Canberra conference last
year, in an effort to force a peace settle-
ment in Japan which would replace
General MacArthur with an international
council (including Russia and therewith
all the futilities of the European scene),
backed a plan to squeeze Japan’s popu-
lation indefinitely into a smaller space
than they have occupied for centuries,
restrict their industries, and reduce their
living standards.
Nothing could be better calculated to
encourage Communism among the Jap-
anese. Dr. Evatt is obsessed with “the
problem of Japan,” ignoring that the
problem is rather Asian in scope. The
facts persist in refuting him, not least
among them that American policy, com-
pletely opposed to “Australia’s,” is build-
ing up in Japan a counterpoise to
Russia. The American chain of modern
airfields now runs from Alaska, through
Japan, to Guam—from the Arctic to the
Equator. “Australia,” which refused -the
U.S. request to include Manus, objects.
While the Evatt foreign policy has been
expressing itself in action through a
mission, “completely successful,” which
toured the Communist-troubled States of
S.-E. Asia to distribute some Disposals
Commission tinned foods and blankets,
Moscow’s Eastern Cominform is prepar-
ing, according to a Singapore message,
to proclaim a Communist republic
in Malaya “in the first week of
August,” and thereafter to “seek a trial
of strength on Singapore Island.” The
next obvious step would be co-operation
with the Cominform agency in Jokjakarta
to start civil war in Java for a Com-
munist republic there also. What Aus-
tralia would do about that is “a matter
for Government consideration.” Hitherto
the only “policy” has been an attitude of
lethargic benevolence towards any and
every symptom in this quarter of Com-
munist violence.
Berlin is not so far away as Canberra
supposes.
Down with Bradman!
From The Bulletin's Oldest Inhabi-
tant :
A. G. Moyes, in his Bradman (Angus and
Robertson), a book written with unsurpassed
knowledge of the subject and in the spirit of
true friendship, refers* to the “undercurrent”
of hostility with which the man Moyes knew
as a country lad has had to contend since
he became the greatest cricketer of his genera-
tion, a .batsman without , a peer. And Moyes
gives examples of “petty criticism that has
never entirely died down and has made Brad-
man’s cricketing life less happy than it might
have been.”
Year after year it followed him. As
recently as 1938 I heard the remark in a
bitter tone, “Here comes the boy wonder.”
It surprised me, for the speaker never bad
cause to dislike Bradman There were
accusations of meanness and unsociability.
Bradman was neither mean nor unsociable.
There was too much of cricket politics.
Bradman knew, of course, who were his
friends, and he knew, too, those who, in
the cricket sense, did not wish him well.
There seemed no sense in it. But the
feeling was there. You could not escape
it if you were in any way associated with
cricket.
There was a paltry exhibition of this “feel-
ing” in Bradman’s first match in Sydney as
captain of South Australia when he was
bowled for “a duck”:
A State selector hurried into the press-
box to explain that it was all a plan that
had been worked out in the dressing-room.
It would teach Bradman, we were meant
to assume, not to leave New South Wales
to play for another State and expect to
get away with it.
The N. S. Wales Cricket Association should
be above this “feeling” if only because Brad-
man has done so much for it on the financial
side. It also has a duty, in cricketing matters,
to show that Sydney has ceased to be what
James Edmond called it, the Eternal Nark.
Yet consider its attitude to the S.A.C.A. pro-
posal, supported by the Victorian body, that,
with Bradman about to turn 40 and retire
from Test-match cricket, a testimonial match
should be played in Melbourne—there, be-
cause choice of the Melbourne Cricket Ground
would be a fair compromise between the claims
of Sydney and Adelaide, and because net
receipts would be greater there. Its reply was
to “suggest” to South Australia that “no definite
arrangements be made until the matter can be
discussed at an inter-State conference,” down
for September!
In the Eternal Nark spirit the Sydney con-
cern pleads that it “decided a few months ago
to play a testimonial match for Kippax and
Oldfield this season.” Actually this decision
was arrived at before the second German
war, but was deferred season after season.
No inconvenience would be caused nor any
injury suffered if it were deferred for another
season. Kippax and Oldfield were good
cricketers and are good fellows, but neither
needs the money. It is no secret in the
cricket world that both are in very comfortable
circumstances. Is Bradman? Moyes writes
with sympathy and understanding on this deli-
cate subject:
That ill-starred venture in Adelaide
promised to be a career for life. But the
employer went to jail, the business to the
scrap-heap and Bradman to the ranks of
the unemployed. It was a situation that
called for all the fortitude he possessed.
He would start his own stockbroking busi- '
ness.
But “the times were out of joint”:
There were ceiling prices. There was
little business. It meant hard work and
long hours, for such a business is per-,
sonal. Clients like attention from the A
principal. How would he fare if he left
to play cricket? Would it not be better
to accept one of the newspaper offers?
He took the hard road. He decided to try
to repay his debt to Australian cricket.
Beyond question the Australian public wants
a Bradman testimonial match and wants It
played in Melbourne; and in Melbourne
should be played whether the N.S.W.C.A. liksfS
it or lumps it. {]
No man in the sporting world has a greater
claim on his country than Bradman. Smiling,
cheerful, always the sportsman and temperate
in all things, he has entertained millions with
his incomparable skill and has set an excellent
example to youth. Many cricketers are
cricketers and nothing more, but Bradman has
other gifts, among them the gift of friendship.
When a pal died in action against the eneipy
he offered the widow the hospitality and affgcr
tioh of his own decent home. Everything this raah
touches —and he is a Man through and throilgh
—he does well. Intelligent and with a fund:
of information, he makes a capital speech*
Indeed, those who know him best hope that
his affairs will prosper sufficiently to enable
him to go into public life. If he does, he
will carry into that sphere a firm, strong mind,

the change, he is no provincial,


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Liaison-Officers. "
'‘Liaison-officers” came in with the
First World War —the expression, though
perhaps not the function, was never heard
of before. In an ill-starred hour the very
non-military “Labor” party, whose First
World War record, as to the last two
years anyhow, will not bear inspection,
borrowed the expression for two of its
own pets, to each of whom it gave a
roving commission.
The term “ill-starred” is appropriate
to John Smith (“Jock”) Garden, who,
as publisher of an astrological sheet,
with horseracing as a sideline, should
have been able to augur his future
from the positions of the heavenly bodies.
Perhaps the stars “ran crook.” Anyway,
Garden was Mr. Ward’s “liaison-
officer” and afterwards Mr. Holloway’s,
with the run of the Ward office —Mr.
Donovan, who was then Mr. Ward’s
private secretary and is now one of Dr.
Evatt’s Conciliation Commissioners, has
placed it on record that Garden was
treated as “one of the staff.” As “one of
the staff” he did things which earned him
three years’ hard.
Garden entered the House of Repre-
sentatives in 1931 a§ a member of the
Lang “Labor” group, elected for the
Cook (N.S.W.) constituency. A con-
temporary member of the Lang “Labor”
group was Rowland James, M.H.R. for
Hunter (N.S.W.). Mr. James himself be-
came a “liaison-officer,” appointed as such
by the present “ ‘Labor’ Government,”
with the use of a Commonwealth car and
chauffeur (fees or travelling expenses un-
stated) to carry its whines to the Miners’
Federation and see what he could do to
induce rebellious lodges to work. Last
week, two months after Mr. Ward’s
“liaison-officer” got what was coming to
him, Mr. James was carried into New-
castle hospital unconscious, having been
badly knocked about in a smash.
According to the “S. M. Herald”
account his Commonwealth car, driven
at 40 to 50 m.p.h. on the Pacific High-
way round 7 p.m.—no thoroughfare
for such a speed at such a time
—“crashed into the back of a
stationary truck,” and Mr. James was,
with difficulty, “extricated from the
wreckage.” The driver was himself
injured, though not seriously. He told
the police that he had been so “dazzled
by the headlights of an oncoming car
that he did not see the stationary truck
in time to avoid a collision.” Other
drivers are wiser in the ways of truck-
men on the Pacific Highway.
As a human being in distress, Mr.
James is entitled to sympathy. But this
feeling does not extend to his “Govern-
ment,” which must have known for
many months that as a “liaison-officer”
he was a total loss. That miners and
wheelers particularly wheelers could
be urged to greater efforts by the sight
and speech of a politician driving up and
away in a flash Government car was
always either a crazy belief or a dishonest
pretence.
Anyway, coal production is worse, the
Miners’ Federation more dictatorial and
pit larrikinism more prevalent than when
Mr. James became a “liaison-officer,”
With a costly Coal Board and Tribunal
added to the outfit. While the doctors
were working on Mr. James, Lysaghts
had to close down for lack of coal, and
the N.S.W. “Labor” Minister of Trans-
port dolorously confessed that his Railway
Department had to make shift with
25.000 tons a week when it needed
53.000 tons. For the same reason a great
part of the 1947-48 wheat harvest has be-
come a prey to rats and mice.
In terms of politics, this “liaison-
officer” business is one of a thousand ex-
amples of wanton “Labor” waste of the
people’s money, extorted by terrific
taxation.
Legalised Fraud.
Faced with the development of the motor
vehicle and the n£ed for more and better
roads, and seeking a means of paying for
the roads, Earle Page, then Federal
Treasurer, introduced a petrol-tax of 3d.
a jjallon on motor spirit in 1926, describing
iti. as a “special Customs duty” which
would be used for road-construction. In
1930 the tax jumped to 7d., in 1940 it went
to Is. and became an unjust tax, since it
was increased to get additional revenue
for war purposes from one particular sec-
tion of the public—the motor-users.
Since it was first imposed petrol-tax
has raked in about £164,000,000, but only
£57,000,000 has been handed over to the
States for road construction, the re-
mainder going into Federal consolidated
revenue. During the war petrol-users,
though realising that they had been singled
out for a special war tax on themselves,
paid up without grumbling. Since the war,
through their various organisations
they’ve been trying to get the tax re-
duced, and, with the backing of the
States and local-government bodies, have
tried to have the money applied to its
original purpose—the building and main-
tenance of roads. Canberra reluctantly
reduced the tax to 10£d., but on the roads
question Mr. Chifley replied to the
N.R.M.A.: “As far as the Common-
wealth is concerned, this tax is primarily
a revenue impost, and its maintenance is
necessary to meet the expenditure of the
Commonwealth.”
Motorists are not only singled out for
savage taxation, but the roads are rapidly
becoming as bad as they were 20 years
ago. States can’t get enough money for
the necessary work; local-government
bodies find it impossible to finance the
maintenance of minor roads. A large
group of motoring, country, engineering
and local-government organisations is
issuing a pamphlet outlining these matters
and calling upon Canberra to apply the
petrol-tax revenue to its proper purpose.
But “Labor,” which has always worked on
the belief that if a man owns a motor
vehicle he is fair game for special taxes
and charges and the “soak-the-rich”
policy, will scarcely be impressed.
The original Act imposing the petrol-
tax was introduced by Earle Page with
these words:
Those benefiting [from new and improved
roads] should specially contribute in some
measure The State Governments, lack-
ing the power to impose Customs duties,
are unable to effectively reach all road-
users. The Commonwealth, therefore, is
co-operating with the States in a national
roads policy and will impose special
THE WORM THAT WOULD NOT TURN.
Customs duties which will be hypothecated
for road construction.
Nobody minded them being “hypothe-
cated” for other purposes during the war.
But the war is three years past, and the
Chifley declaration that petrol-tax
revenue is “primarily a revenue impost”
is merely an alibi for legalised fraud, a
game at which Socialists of the Chifley
brand seem to be particularly apt. The
Opposition should remember the petrol-
tax in the coming election year.
The Adopted Child.
When a just-born baby boy was dis-
covered, injured and abandoned, in frost-
coated grass on one of Sydney’s coldest
mornings extraordinary public interest
was aroused. Taken to hospital, the mite
put up a grand battle for life, assisted by
the doctors and nurses of a great
maternity hospital; but its hurts and the
exposure proved to be too much.
Astonishing scenes of genuine feeling
contrasted with sentimental and morbid
hysteria at the burial of the pitiful re-
mains.
Sentiment and morbidity aside, the
episode showed that Australians have not
lost their natural sympathy, and the pity
of it is that, had the guilty ones taken
the child to a hospital or simply wrapped
it warmly and left it on somebody’s
doorstep, it would have been cared for
and would have quickly found a home.
Thousands of people these days are
anxious to adopt children. Child-welfare
organisations in the various States re-
port long waiting-lists of would-be foster-
parents. It is a post-war development
meriting the attention of social workers,
the medical profession and psychologists.
If the widespread desire to adopt a child
comes from people who are unable to
have children by natural processes, there
are so many of them as to suggest a very
startling breakdown in either fertility or
the female ability to conduct a preg-
nancy to a successful conclusion. It
may, to some extent, explain the falling
birthrate, and on that ground alone is
worth looking into. On the other hand,
if many of the women are willing to rear
a child but are unwilling to face actual
motherhood that also should be ex-
amined ; and there may be cases where
the husband is unwilling for his wife to
bear children, though ready enough to
adopt a child. Again, to what extent
does the shortage of domestic help affect
these questions?
It is pretty certain that most adoptions
are successful. Infants “bring their love
with them,” and those who have success-
fully adopted a child soon practically
forget the circumstances of its arrival in
the family. What’s more, amongst their
intimate circles are witnesses to the suc-
cess of the experiment, and many are
impelled to “go and do likewise.” It is
a good thing, taken by and large; but a
country with a static birthrate can
scarcely afford merely to be content with
the fact of the popularity,,of adoption.
It should be investigating the social,
psychological and medical background to
the whole thing.
Now It's Wheat.
Last year the Australian wheat harvest
was a record at 220 million bushels. It
won’t be that much this year, but even a
moderate harvest is likely to cause
political paralysis, because millions of
bushels of last year’s crop are still in the
country, and look like being there when
the headers go into the new crop. Nearly
half of the 100 million bushels which
N.S.W. grew last year not only has not
moved from farms and country stations,
but doesn’t look like moving for months.
Undersupplied with bulk trucks because
shortage of coal has caused a deficiency
of steel for construction and repairs,
forced to cut down trains because there
isn’t enough coal to run them, the N.S.W.
Government Railways have fallen down
on the job. Fleets of motor-trucks are
desperately trying to clear the grain
away from country silos to seaboard at
a cost of around 2s. Bd. a bushel in
freight. Flour-mills are forced to close
down because the railways can’t keep the
wheat up to them. And wheat and flour
ships lie idle in the harbors for the same
reason —though 40 ships are scheduled to
load wheat and flour for overseas be-
tween now and the end of August.
Stored in stacks, in silos and on farms
in the N.S.W. wheatbelt is an estimated
42 million bushels, most of it in the
north-west, where the new harvest is little
more than three months away. That new
harvest, according to the growers them-
selves, will come from a third less
acreage than last year —not because men
are unwilling to grow wheat or because
the world is any less hungry for it, but
because N.S.W. coalminers won’t dig
coal and consequently there is no fuel
and power to manufacture the necessary
farm implements.
It need scarcely be added that all tips
is not improved by the dreadful inertia
that has descended on the Australian
waterfront, where it is never known how
long ships must wait, though certain they
will wait long—a blight that has lately
spread to New Zealand, where a wheat
ship, the Mountpark, carrying some of
that notorious “five - and - mnepenny
wheat,” was one of a string of idle ships
because of a wharf strike over the
handling of hatches. The vessel, it is
said, has made only three trips to and
from Australia since October last year.
Feeble and muddling government,
which is the lot of sny country ruled by
these crazy Socialists with their delirious
notion that nobody except a Govern-
ment official is capable of managing any-
thing, reaches out in so many different
ways to gum-up the country’s works that
in the end it becomes almost unpossible
to put blame on any one individual or
department. The whole mad outfit has a
staggering capacity to hit anything and
everything that comes within its reach.
In this particular instance it is hitting
hungry people as in other directions it
hits the aged, the sick and the thrifty,
and as, in its wider scope, it hits the
nation’s production, economy and good
name. The special mess made of the
1947-48 wheat harvest is merely typical
of the whole mess.
Arbitration Under Blackmail.
The exorbitant wage demands of the
Communist executive of the Seamen’s
Union are fatal to household budgets and
the national economy alike; hence a
“Labor” clamor for continuance of the
subsidy on inter-State shipping which
Chifley is proposing to abandon in re-
venge for the prices referendum “No”
vote.
Australian seamen (who spend two days
in port for every one day at sea) under
the award which they have now had in-
creased were getting;
£29 12s. 6d. a month (inclusive of the
war-risk bonus of 25 per cent, still paid
three years after the war), and all found.
Plus a 40-hour week, with overtime of
4s. 3d. an hour in port, and at sea (with
the 25 per cent, war bonus added), ss. 3_(d.
Plus special rates for working ship’s
cargo-winches in port.
Plus paid annual leave of one day for
each month of service, and 16 hours’ (paid)
leave each week, including overtime allow-
ance calculated on an eight-hour-day basis.
They threatened a general strike unless
the new “temperamentally - fitted”
(Theodore’s old phrase) Conciliation
Commissioner Hamilton Knight (Mc-
Kell’s erstwhile Labor Minister) gave
them all they asked in a new award;
Another £l2 a month (which would in-
clude and perpetuate the war-risk bonus of
25 per cent, extra).
Higher overtime rates and double time
on Sundays and public holidays, and in-
creased annual leave.
Waiting-pay when vessels are delayed,
such as when wharfies won’t work or an
odd fireman won’t leave a pub at sailing-
time.
Increases for watchmen and all sorts of
special rates for trivial duties.
Worst of all, the Communist union-
boss Elliott announced, a couple of days
before Ham. Knight’s award was to be
delivered, that if the finding was not
“proper and retrospective” a general sea-
men’s strike, to include colliers, would be
ordered throughout Australia. Appar-
ently there can be no “contempt of Court”
towards a Conciliation Commissioner’s
jurisdiction, or this barefaced attempt at
industrial blackmail would earn its proper
penalty.
In the event Ham. Knight gave them £8
(instead of £l2) a month extra “seagoing
allowance,” thus making permanent the
equivalent (and more) of the war-risk
bonus, an increase of overtime rates to a
flat ss. an hour, rejected Sunday claims,
and said the parties should confer
privately on annual leave.
This finding coincides with another
“conciliator’s” award recently for sea-
going shipwrights, terms which the sea-
men’s Communist boss had rejected in
advance. If the union continues to reject
them, and Ham. Knight gives in, there
will be nothing left of arbitration in Dr.
Evatt’s new “streamlined” system—or of
conciliation either; industrial law, what
is left of it, will have succumbed.
Gold Bounty?
With production-costs catching up to
the fixed price of gold, Westralians are
worried about what used to be their
greatest industry. They suggest a bounty
of £2 10s. an ounce, and they can quote
a useful precedent.
At the instance of energetic Westralians,
a Gold Bounty Act was passed in 1930
as a depression measure. It provided for a
payment of £1 “on each ounce of fine gold
produced in excess of average production
for the three years 1928-30.” Reduced to
10s. an ounce in 1932, it was “suspended
in 1933. But the effect was such that the
value of Australian output rose from
£1,981,971 in-1939 to £6,401,019 in 1933
the rise in Westralia being from £1,602,142
in 1929 to £4,915,958 in 1933. A corres-
ponding increase could be a signal ser-
vice in these times.
By virtue of an Act which came into
force last month, but was dated back to
January 1, the Canadian Government is
paying the mineowner 50 p.c. of cost or
production exceeding $lB an ounce ; and
“cost of production” is defined in a liberal
spirit. Fifteen p.c. p.a. is allowed for pre-
production costs and depreciation, and
allowable also are “exploration and de-
velopment expenses required to maintain
ore reserves up to three years,” while new
mines may let depreciation deductions and
production expenses pile up until income-
tax begins to operate —they are exempt
for three years. In the increasingly urgent
need for gold production this is a wise
and generous policy.
But when the Westralian industry asks
Canberra for some relief the answer is a
lemon.

CARRERAS LIMITED - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR QUALITY
POLITICAL POINTS
According to “S. M. Herald,” the
U.S.A. has refused to let Britain into its
atom-bomb secrets without express
assurances that they will not be passed
on to Australia, and has refused to take
Australia into its confidence lest Com-
munists get to know everything and be-
tray it to Moscow. In effect, the Ameri-
cans, and the British as well, know a
great deal more of what is going on in
Australia, especially on the unresisted
Red front, than Canberra, with its pesti-
lent nonsense about the Communist con-
spiracy being a “political philosophy,”
ever bargained for. But it is nasty to
know that Australia, under “Labor,”
is suspected. It was never before sus-
pected at any period of its history.
In the closing days of Tasmania’s just-
deceased Parliament two members, one
“Labor,” one Liberal, asked for better
treatment by Ministers of members’ ques-
tions. It isn’t only in the Speck Parlia-
ment that Ministers seem to take the
attitude that questions other than
“Dorothy Dixes” are an impertinence.
Canberra Ministers are prone to regard
any Opposition question as a personal
attack,
Chifley chose a queer, time for asking
everyone to work harder —without, of
course, mentioning coalminers, wharf-
laborers and seamen who, under Com-
munist direction, don’t only refuse to
work hard themselves but prevent multi-
tudes of others from working hard or at
all, A returned wanderer himself, the
P.M. has sent two Ministers to Britain,
where they will meet a large party of poli-
ticians bound for the Empire Parlia-
mentary Association palavers. Another
large party is in Queensland enjoying the
mild winter, and there is another in Japan.
And Chifley’s appeal was made when
millions of victims of his bloodsucking
imposts were struggling with their income-
tax returns.
A significant sequel to the loss of
Kogarah was a Caucus attack on Housing
Minister (“Russia and Us”) C. Evatt.
One thing said was that his Housing Com-
mission had “grabbed more land in and
around Sydney than it could build on in
twenty years,” wherefore dispossessed
workers had retaliated by voting against
The Party. Kogarah and Hurstville, C.
Evatt’s constituency, adjoin. Number
of electors in 1947 was 27,750 in Hurst-
ville and 26,864 in Kogarah, the “Labor”
majorities being 3759 and 3732 respec-
tively. The Liberal majority at the
Kogarah by-election was 829. So less of
a turnover in Hurstville would enable C.
Evatt to give’his undivided attention to
the Australian-Russian Society.
Schoolteachers know better than to
punish an unruly boy and then apologise
and remit the punishment, but the Steve-
doring Industry Commission is different.
When Queensland wharfies struck in
sympathy with the rail strikers the S.I.C.
cancelled 10 days’ annual-leave “credits”
they had accumulated. Now it has re-
stored the “credits” —10 days at 38s,
a day, to be paid by the injured
party ; and the wharfies may strike again
any time they feel like it.
The Communist-run Miners’ Federa-
tion is against having Poles and Balts in
the pits because “they are tainted with
anti-trade-unionism and Fascism.” Trans-
lated from the Communist lingo this
means that Poles and Balts are “out” be-
cause they would work.
The latest about the Department of
Post-war Obstruction is that it is to be
“wound up” on June 30, 1950. That
should give Dr. Coombs time to effect
the “revolution in the building industry”
he promised in 1944. So far his “revolu-
tion” has signally failed to revolve.
With 14 Federal members enjoying the
Queensland sunshine the State has been
informed from Canberra that Ward is
making the trip “to talk about the uni-
form-rail proposals.” The liaison-officer,
if any, is not named.
The politicians’ union will have to do
something about the Liberal M.L.A. for
Manly (N.S.W.), Darby. He is working
his passage as a steward, a
precedent that must be squashed.
“Federal Labor” is toying with the
notion of making overtime pay tax-free.
If it comes off who will want to “work
for Chifley” when be can get “time and
a half” or “double time” untaxed?
At the end of May, “enlisted personnel”
excluded, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment employed 167,600 persons, the
State Governments 359,500 and “local-
government authorities” 60,700. The total,
587,800, is more than the population of
Westralia and more than twice the popu-
lation of Tasmania.
The P.M.G.’s Department has failed to
trace the shrinkingly modest owner of the
690 £lO notes posted in a brown-paper
parcel from King’s Cross, Sydney, to an
address in Brisbane and returned un-
claimed. The search proceeds, and so
does the search for the depositor of at
least one fortune in a Melbourne bank
who refuses to come forward, if he is
above ground. And there was at least
one report of a pile of Australian pound-
notes being carried into the American
money-market and sold at a generous
discount. Mysterious occurrences all;
but then this is an age of mysteries.
“S. M. Herald” published an item pre-,
dieting that Chifley would “call for
higher production” in a Macquarie
speech. Bang alongside this was some
coal news: “Strikes at 11 N.S.W. col-
lieries caused a production loss of 5667
tons.” Accident or some of Granny’s
mordant humor?
The Commissioner-General in S.-E.
Asia, with whom Chifley conferred on
the Communist violence in Malaya—
without sending him any of the arms
asked for a month ago—is the same
representative of the British Crown of
whom the Australian Communist Sharkey
declared last month —about the time the
“Government’s” aid was first requested—
“ What has to be struck down in Malaya
is not, as that Imperialist dog Malcolm
MacDonald declares, the Malayan Com-
munist party, but brutal British imperial-
ism.” • Questioned in Parliament last
month about this Communist dog’s trea-
son, Chifley said he “would have in-
quiries made,” He would return the same
answer to a question about an impounded
cow.
Before boarding the plane which took
him abroad —for the umpteenth time—
Dr. Evatt was delivered of a cryptic
compliment to his chief;
When Mr. Chifley says “will,” he means
will, and when he says “will not,” he means
will not.
Interesting, but incomplete without speci-
men questions and answers;
Communist leader: Chifley, if required
by the Communist party, will you crawl on
your belly from the Commonwealth Bank
Building, Sydney, to Marx House?—l will.
And will you ever do anything of which
the Communist party disapproves?—l will
not.
When a Queensland solicitor, defend-
ing in a s.-p. case, said it was time Gov-
ernment betting-shops were legalised, a
“high Government authority” replied
that the Government wouldn’t have it.
Governments running lotteries can’t
afford open competition.
If the A.L.P, condemnation of Com-
munism really meant anything “Labor”
Ministers would have the guts to send
cheeky comrades of either sex about their
business when they “demonstrate.” A
mob of about 200 called at N.S.W. Par-
liament House “to interview Ministers
and members on price-control.” Graham
(Agriculture) gave audience to a com-
mittee of three; the president of the
“New Housewives,” “Runaway” Rowe
and Bully Buhner. Graham told them
he would “convey their demands to the
Government.” He probably had no in-
tention of doing anything about it, but
why didn’t the man tell them to get on
with their jobs and let him get on with
his?
A Brisbane “Courier-Mail” writer allows
that “North Queenslanders are agitating
for a New State” but tells them there are
“insurmountable difficulties in the way.”
The insurmountable difficulties boil down
to hostile “Labor” majorities in the Par-
liaments at Brisbane and Canberra. No
doubt many Americans out for regional
self-government were told there were
“insurmountable difficulties in the way.”
The difficulties were surmounted by firm
men, deriving strength from a just cause,
as they can be in North Queensland, New
England and the Riverina, as witness the
admission to the Union, to its great ad-
vantage, of North Dakota, South Dakota.
Montana and Washington in 1889, of
Idaho and Wyoming in 1890, of Utah in
1896, and, in our Federal period, of
Oklahoma in 1907 and of Arizona and
New Mexico in 1912.
There should be an interesting scene in
the N.S.W. Leg. Council when Downing
the “Labor” Minister of Justice, intro-
duces a bill designed 6 to effect “sweeping
changes in the tenancy laws.” One clause,
noted by “S. M. Herald”:
If a person who buys a property or has
owned it less than two years desires pos-
session, he must give the tenant 18 months’
notice to quit.
Downing bought a grazing property in
May, 1946, in the Goulburn district-
according to Lang’s “Century,” from
McKell. On April 14, 1948, he gave a
tenant, who had a tenancy agreement dated
from December 23, 1946, notice to quit.
The tenant appealed, but the judgment of
the Supreme Court was against him. And
so “Labor,” or the crowd that uses that
name, goes forward to the destiny that
awaits it.
A Local Government Department in-
spector has been going into the affairs of
the Canterbury (Sydney) Council during
the period when S. G. Parry, M.L.C.,
was Mayor. He found that Parry had
bought an estate of 83 acres and “dedi-
cated” portion of a roadway, on which
the council obligingly spent £1392 of the
ratepayers’ money. Subsequently, with-
out reference to the council, there were
transactions in five blocks of which
Parry became the owner. The inspec-
tor’s report, read in conjunction with the
Land Sales Control report, indicates that
flies never roost on Parry. Parry is
good-as-La.bor (as he was all there with
his vote for Assemblymen’s pensions),
and this is a great age for good-as-Labor
worthies, such as Parry, “Romano” and
Biber, and doubtless many more.
Dollars have been refused to a Wes-
tralian girl, by all accounts another
Eileen Joyce in the making, who won an
A.B.C. scholarship for study in New
York. Did nobody tell the young woman
that if she disguised herself as a jockey
or a bookmaker she would get them?
The Communist leaders arrested by the
Americans’ F. 8.1. toe the party line in one
obvious respect—they are an ugly-looking
lot. Tito was the one boss-Com. whose
counterfeit presentment could be gazed at
without getting sore eyes, and —possibly
for that reason —he is “out” and reviled
by his abject associates for many years
and their putrid sheets all the world over,
with Australia’s at the rear of the proces-
sion, as always. It is dingily appropriate
that Red ruffians should be ill-favored,
seeing that their conspiracy is evil. The
hate that devours them shows in their
hard, unsmiling faces.
The “Argus” has been driven to admit
—and so would other Great Dailies if
they thought open confession good for
their souls—that it “has almost leaned
over backwards to be fair to the P.M,”
It could never, without self-abasement,
compliment him on his timing.
Wharf strikes, the threat of a seamen’s
strike unless Conciliation Commissioner
Hamilton Knight came to heel, and the
threat of a coalminers’ strike if the Coal
Industry Board insisted on coalminers act-
ing up to their obligations—these were
features of the Australian scene at the
week-end. On the Communist side they
were all expressed in the language of
larrikins overbold in the absence of police.
Meantime Elliott (imp,), the Communist
boss of the Seamen’s Union, said his
crowd would boycott any vessel carrying
arms for Malaya, where many Australians
and their womenfolk are in danger of
being slaughtered by Elliott’s friends,
Chinese terrorists, and that other Com-
munist larrikin Sharkey, back from south-
east Asia, whither he went with a “Labor”
passport, said his “party” would “make
every effort to stop the export of arms
to Malaya.” Where was the “Govern-
ment” all this time? In consultation with
its “peace officers,” preparatory to order-
ing them to take Red ruffians by the back
of the neck and deport them by the first
ship outward bound? No ; invisible and
dumb, as always—perhaps hiding in a
hollow log.
What with steep prices for fuel and
oil, repairs and replacements, petrol-tax,
sales - tax, heavily - increased insurance
charges and so forth, the average car-
owner finds costs getting out of hand.
To have them increased by damage and
wear and tear on bad roads, for whose
upkeep he is ostensibly charged on
every gallon of petrol he buys, is bad
enough. To realise that Canberra surlily
refuses to disgorge petrol-tax money and
apparently intends to continue making the
motorist the victim of unjust taxation is
worse. But, then, who isn’t a victim of
the Chifley Socialists?
One of those economists, a Melbourne
University professor, has coined a new
word. He predicts a “downturn” in three
to six years, apparently meaning some-
thing about halfway between present con-
ditions and a depression. The depth of
the “downturn,” in the prof.’s view, will
depend upon the measures taken to meet
it. Nearly all the politicians have already
taken measures to meet it —“upped” their
salaries.
Melbourne University’s School of
Physiology has engaged a couple of girl-
contortionists to perform before it so that
specialists may watch muscle reaction.
Australians find much to interest them
in the spectacle of their P.M. contorting
himself at the demands of Communists.
A young American, a Guadalcanal
veteran who is married to an Australian
girl, was granted a top-priority passage
to Australia when the Consul-General in
New York learnt he was an experienced
rocket-bomb worker. Arrived in Mel-
bourne, he lodged three applications with
the Ministry of Munitions for long-
range-weapon work. He was stalled for
five months and then told that he was
“ahead of his time” :
We cannot utilise the unique experience
you have, but some time in the future Aus-
tralia will need it.
Meanwhile the American is testing
hydraulic shock-absorbers in a Melbourne
factory.
“Pravda” has discovered that “Red Air
Force pilots bore the brunt of the air
fighting in the war, while the British and
American Air Forces encountered no
serious resistance”:
.The bulk of the German Air Force was
concentrated on the Soviet-German front,
where our pilots methodically and merci-
lessly destroyed it.
After which, of course. Red bombers
flattened German industry, did. all the pre-
paratory bombing for the invasion of
Europe, gave all-out support and com-
plete cover for the Allied armies on the
Western front and, when Germany threw
in the towel, switched their forces to the
Pacific and dropped the atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.


HOUSEWIVES’ HANDICAP AT THE COMMO GAMES.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Bo”; The wife came in from the
laundry wiping her hands on her apron
and muttering something about coal-
miners, “Has the gas gone off under
the copper again?” I asked. “No,” she
said. “It’s just that its thermal content
has become so debilitated that it’s led to
the extinction of the flame.” I stared
at her. It was the second idiotic, para-
doxical thing she’d said in a few minutes,
and I was becoming puzzled. Dismissing
it at last as one of those queer little ways
that wise men tell husbands they should
tolerate rather than bite at, I asked her
if young Bobby was still out in the pad-
dock playing football. “No,” replied
Mrs. 80. “He’s engaged in kicking an
inflated piece of elliptical-shaped leather
about,” This was more than anyone
could stand. I was just about to fly off
the handle when my eye fell on the open
page of the morning paper at a place
marked in pencil, and I saw right away
where this new cult of the senseless phrase
was coming from. It was a statement by
NiS.W. Minister for Idle Mines, J. M,
Baddeley. “There are no more strikes
now,” quoth Cessnock’s intellectual
giant; “only a few stoppages.” Yes, the
day he said it 8550 tons of coal were lost
through strikes in 13 pits.

“Salmon Gums”; In the eyes of
philatelists does a stamp gain or lose in
value through being date-stamped 12
months before it is issued? A Perth col-
lector wants to know, because he has one
“You’re OUT — for a drake!”
r— . . , , . ,
—a Farrer stamp posted to him on the
day of issue, 12/7/’4B. The postal clerk
who cancelled it hadn’t caught up with
the change of the year and was still show-
ing 1947. The problem will be debated
heatedly in far-flung stamp circles—the
Perth man posted a batch of first-day
envelopes to friends abroad ; all were
dispatched from the same post-ofiice.
“ ’Chaser”: “Mike Rikey” (B. 7/7/’4B)
is on the right track but a little off the
beam with his contention that Gordon
must be a major poet because a race
named in his honor is run annually at Mt.
Gambier. Mt. Gambier is, after all, but
a minor racecourse ; so, too, is Moonee
Valley, which also has its Lindsay
Gordon Steeplechase. But enshrined in
the immortal pages of Miller's Sporting
Annual, under the heading “Cross-
country Riding Performances,” is the in-
disputable fact that “Adam Lindsay
Gordon rode three steeplechase-winners
at Flemington, 10/10/’68.” That, as
nothing else could, rates’ him a really
major poet.
* * * *
“Lakka Lakka”; The newspapers have
been making a mouthful of the Canberra
National Librarian’s statement that he
is not a censor, and will therefore allow
Love Me, Sailor to be read by those
who use the library. Things were not
ever thus in Canberra! I recall hearing
a magistrate ask for Krafft-Ebbing’s
book on Abnormal Psychology there.
The young librarian informed him the
book was not available to the general
public, adding; “We do not believe in
allowing psychological works of that
nature to be read by laymen!” The
magistrate’s wrath was cold but effec-
tive. “Young fellow,” he said, “for your
information there is no such category
as ‘layman’ in psychology. Furthermore,
I do not recognise you as a judge of
what books I require to read ; you are
merely a servant of the general public;,
of which I am one; you are paid by us
to look after our books —not your books,
but ours. I have asked you for Krafft-
Ebbing. Get it for me without further
waste of time.” He got it in a matter
of seconds.
♦ * * *
“Aerobatsky”; I am rather intrigued
by the report that in Moscow last week,
during a display of “Achievements of
Military Aviation,” a group of 96 planes
flew over, forming the words “Glory to
Stalin.” Unless fire Muscovite alphabet
has been radically altered since my stamp-
collecting days, this must rate as the
greatest achievement of any form of
aviation.

“Flathead”: A hand which rose from
below the surface of George-street, Syd-
ney, and accepted the makings from a
workman standing near, I found be-
longed to a shade named George, A
splicer of underground phone-wires, he
was a man content with his job. “In
the summer,” he told me, “the pavements
get hot and I do a bit of a roast, but
now, in the winter, it’s lovely. I sit down
here as warm as toast. With the blow-
lamp on to a billy of tea, I can look up
at them watching me like frogs.” As he
casually fished into the jungle of conver-
sation and took out the wire he wanted, I
learned that what he liked best about the
job were the faces of his audience when,
with wires splayed eveprwhere, he
seemed, as now, in the midst of some
monstrous tangle, “The only time I’ve
really been bushed was last Christmas
after a couple of jugs. I was trying to
get a number for ten minutes before I
found that I’d clipped the lead on to my
shoe-lace.”

“Hoop”: Our butcher regards his hol-
lowed block with the same affection that
lawyers of old had

outside their wait-
ing - rooms. Chief
cause of the concave
is Aub, a weighty
assistant who can
make the chopper
whistle and who
must sooner or later
split the block to the
floor. He still has
all his fingers, no
nerves and a quaint
sense of humor
notably apparent
when some dear old
thing cringes at the

“Bohemian”: Vanished debtors (B.
9/6/’48)? I recall some who didn’t vanish
To my Maoriland mining village came a
party of four—a lady singer and three
males—a comedian, a dancer and a violin-
player—members of an English vaudeville
company that had gone bung. The first
night the house was worth 155.; the
second night they had to close down.
They had been driven to the town by
coach on the nod, and the driver refused
to take them back without the chips.
Bung, who owned the hall and the puo,
got a brilliant idea. The whitebait season
“I’m considering holding an exhibition shortly, Miss Stripper
was just beginning, and he suggested they
go whitebaiting and sell the fish to the
villagers. The local rag also had its bill,
likewise the bellman and billsticker. The
newchum fishermen were successful and
sold the whitebait at 4d. a quart, 2d. below
the local price. For two months they
kept the fishing going. They helped at
the hospital concert, and the lady sang
solos in the Anglican Church. The vil-
lagers organised a concert and dance for
their benefit. It cleared £l2, and with the
profit from the whitebait they paid off all
their debts and left with a credit balance
of £3O.
* * ♦ *
“Windsor”: “Clooter’s” derisive com-
ment on Coud (B. 7/7/’4B), that “there
must have been good money in these
stunts” is rather unfair to a philanthropist
with an intense love for his fellow-men.
Emile Coue devoted his days, his nights
and his worldly goods to the alleviation
of human suffering. When an entrance fee
was charged for his lectures the pro-
ceeds went to the relief of the disabled
and suffering of World War I. His
system was but a simple use of the prin-
ciples of Applied Psychology, and in his
day the unimaginative laughed at his
little jingle “Every day and in every way
I am getting better and better” —but it
worked miracles. Thousands who have
repeated the night-and-morning formula
conscientiously and believingly have
proved that it is no mere vain repetition
but a battlecry of actual accomplishment.
Coue was a great humanitarian who did
untold good, and “hitting the jackpot”
was the last of his thoughts.

“Torch”: That A.B.C. man who said
over the air: “Come on, come on. Give
us the score, you bloody fool,” recalls
a similar slip a commercial station made
a few years ago. The children’s session
had just finished and the air was momen-
tarily silent. Then a cultured voice came
clearly and with deep feeling: “Well,
that’s got rid of those little blankards! ”
♦ * * *
“Asha” (Fiji): I am accustomed to
Government red-tape, but only recently
I discovered that our local hospital is
also an offender. Tuesday and Thurs-
day are “operating days,” and patients
seeking a consultation are then manifestly
unwelcome. The situation was thrown
into comic relief a few days ago. A
small Indian boy met with an accident
late in the afternoon, and his father im-
mediately took him to hospital, where he
was met by an irate Indian doctor de-
manding why the child had not been
brought earlier in the day.
* * * *
“Balander”: The proposition that a
rise in the price of veges, should auto-
matically increase the maintenance rate
to a wife enjoying such a legal arrange-
ment was squashed by a Brisbane magis-
trate the other day, not because he
believed it would be unjust to the main-
taining husband but because if one main-
tained wife got away with it the Court
“would not be able to cope with applica-
tions.” Tfoe case was one in which the
wife of “Lucky Bill Rankin,” a Queens-
land lottery-ticket agent whose real name
appears to be Bill Fox, sought a third
increase in maintenance, having been
successful in two applications within the
past year. “Lucky Bill” she described
as a wealthy man, with four Casket
agencies earning him £B5OO a year, subur-
ban and country property, a yacht, four
cars and “a ring on his finger worth
£800.” Claiming that she couldn’t keep
herself on the £4 2s. 6d. a week she is
now getting, she quoted the price of
peas and cabbages to prove it. She failed
for the reasons given, and there’ll doubt-
less be many women in her position who
would like to talk to that magistrate,
I’m not sure what it all proves, except
that to be a sub-agent for a Government-
run gambling business seems to be a
better spec, than following Mr, Chifley’s
political-deathbed exhortation to “Pro-
duce, produce!”

“Tomsea” (Shanghai): Australia should
be seeing its first Chinese movie soon,
as the See Pao production “Phoney
Phoenix” (nicknamed “The Barber Takes
a Wife”) is to be dubbed in English and
sent throughout the world. The Chinese
are not far behind Hollywood in pub-
licity, and for the premiere the barbers
of Shanghai were invited to sit in. With-
out any warning the invited barbers went
berserk, flashed razors in front of the
theatre and boycotted it until offensive
parts, featuring the razor, were culled
out.
* * * •
“Findy”:
That Bulletin with the comment on the
1885 railway smash (B. 21/7/’4B) is included in
a bound volume on my shelves. Turning to
it the other night to read the article I became
interested in the advertisements. The Pall Mall
Electric Association was guaranteeing that Dr.
Scott’s Electric Brush, “an honest remedy pre-
scribed by the best physicians,” would posi-
tively cure headaches, neuralgia, falling hair,
baldness and dandruff. The brush must have
been good; according to the ad., it was in
regular use not only by the Prince and Princess
of Wales, Bismarck, the King of Holland and
W. E. Gladstone, but also by “Lady A.
Churchill, daughter of the Duke of Marlborough
(hero of Blenheim).” As Winston’s great
ancestor died in 1722, the lady must have been
at least 163 years old—a striking testimony to
the efficacy of the brush. But the electric brush
was not the only boon vouched for by its users.
Joseph Lingard, of Alexandria, Sydney, and
G. A. Brown, of the Exchange Hotel, West
Maitland, were both prepared to testify that the
aperient action of Emil Frese’s Hamburg Tea
was “gentle but efficacious,” and J. H. Webb,
M.R.C.S., having tasted Bavarian Hop Bitters,
went on record as saying that they were “suit-
able for those conditions of the liver and
stomach that require herbal stimulants.” Other
health aids offered included Abraham’s Pills,
prepared from dandelions, “the great liver
remedy”; August Flower (for dyspepsia, “two
doses will relieve you”); Cigars de Joy (for
asthma and bronchitis); and a batch of specifics
guaranteed to “restore manhood and the vigor
of life.” R. Burgis, of 170 Pitt-street, was
prepared to make a suit to measure for £3 3s.
Australian port wine could be had for Is. 6d.
a bottle; Murrumbidgee Port for 2s. Anthony
Horderns, after remarking that “the world is
made of atoms, the ocean of drops,” pointed
out that the little things of life —needles and
threads and buttons —could be obtained in their
haberdashery department. A sketch of an old
gentleman, bearded and bespectacled, was ad-
vanced as proof that he had “been hunting for
ease all his life and had found it at last with
the Argosy Braces at Gowing Bros.” He was
possibly the man of whom it was first said
that he had “gone to Gowings.” But the most
intriguing ad. of all extolled the merits of the
Autophone, “the most perfect, the most useful
and the most enduring musical instrument of
modern times. It weighs less than three pounds,
has the lungs of a full-sized parlor organ and
executes its music with absolute precision and
perfect effect.” The Autophone was reputed
to be so simple that a child could play any
of the 300 hymns, waltzes, polkas, marches
and popular songs offered for selection, and
its sponsors, the Oriental Gold Company, felt
that as the price was only 30s. it was “criminal
for any parent, except, of course, the absolutely
poor, to let his household be without it.”
Against this full-column ad. the notice of
another purveyor of melody stood out in dig-
nified contrast: “Reginald Toms, teacher of
the piano. Communications to be addressed
c/o Paling and Co.”
THE CARDUS BLIGHT.
“A ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ correspondent enters
a protest against ‘the flowers of metaphor nurtured
by Cardus-smitten cricket-writers in their flamboyant
reports.’ ”
Too right! They stick in quite a lot of gorges,
Get many a reader’s goat, it’s safe to say,
These highfalutin metaphoric orgies
That cricket-critics revel in today.
The chaps who with comparisons bombard us
From art or science, minstrelsy or war.
Keep us in mind of all that Neville Cardus
Has got to answer for.
They illustrate the magic and the mystery
Of some deft stroke that wins approving words
By wordy parallels from natural history
Of darting fishes or of swooping birds.
And when they note some incident mischancy
That ends all right, you find them apt to gush
On its resemblance to some poet’s fancy
Or long-dead artist’s brush.
When some famed batsman, amid keen regret-
ting,
To some slick trundler, near as famous, falls,
They’re apt to feature Hector’s carcass getting
Dragged .by Achilles around Trojan walls.
But should some youngster down a champ,
attesting
Thereby a pretty knack of spin or swing,
They see in him a modern David besting
Goliath with a sling.
In labored terms, with imagery glowing,
They mirror the dejection, grim and hard,
Of some poor cove pavilionwards who’s going
Because a rat is in his timberyard.
With turgid metaphors their ruling passion,
They chronicle the bat-and-ball duet,
These followers of the flamboyant fashion
That Neville Cardus set.
A quaint development, a curious usance!
But to myself, and those who think the same,
All this symbolic fustian grows a nuisance
When splashed so lavishly about a game.
You scribes, through whom vicarious admittance
We gain to entertainments such as these,
Couldn’t you give these metaphors their quittance
And stick to similes?

“Uco”: Inured as they are to reports
of brutal murders, Sydney newspaper-
readers last week were stirred out of their
customary apathy by the story of a crime
of more than usual callousness. A baby
less than half an hour old was found
wrapped in newspaper alongside the road-
way at Herne Bay. Blue with cold and
with an injured head, the little chap was
rushed to hospital and placed in a
humidcrib—-an apparatus which keeps a
steady temperature of 96 degrees. First
reports suggested that be would survive,
but pneumonia and cerebral haemorrhage
developed and he died after two days.
Extraordinary interest was aroused by
the baby’s struggle. Hundreds of people
phoned Crown-street Hospital, more than
30 offers of adoption were received and
dozens of gifts of clothing. When death
came the Campsie police, who had taken
the baby to hospital, subscribed the cost
and made all arrangements for the
funeral, wreaths were sent from all sec-
tions of the community and private cars
were made available to carry the many
people who attended the funeral. This
ceremony was unhappily the scene of
some mob exhibitionism. The Govern-
ment Medical Officer’s verdict was that
death resulted from a fractured skull and
pneumonia,, which was equivalent to say-
ing that a charge of murder would lie
against the inhuman wretch who flung the
baby out on the roadside to perish.

“Waddlin’ Willie”; “Thumbs-up” (B.
7/7/’4B) did more to bring the R.AA.F.
war-time air crew and ground staff to-
gether than anything else. It was
“thumbs-up” to the ground-staff “erk”
that told us it was o.k. to press the but-
ton and turn the Pratt and Whitney’s
over for another job. It was “thumbs-
up” on our return that told this same
“erk” that we were well and back again.
Never once in six years with the
R.A.A.F. did I interpret the sign to mean
anything but a reliable means of visual
communication linked with the comrade-
ship so solid in the squadrons.

“Taswegian”:' Sartorial problems have
been worrying two of Hobart’s leading
citizens—Mr. Pike, the new Speaker in
the Assembly, and Hobart’s Lord Mayor
Harris. During the war Speaker Dwyer,
for austerity reasons, did not wear cere-
monial dress ; Pike wishes to revert to the
old tradition. But with a dissolution
imminent, he has decided to wait a while
before he shells out for the robes; the
next Speaker may not be his build. The
Lud Mayor is also a believer in tradition,
and wishes to deck himself out in all the
Mayoral trimmings. Among other
things, he has unearthed the long-for-
gotten Mayoral sword. But when should
he wear it? And with what costume?
When he learned the answers he shook
his head sadly and put the sword away
again. It should be worn in the presence
of royalty or vice-royalty and with knee-
breeches and hose.

“Ray Whiting”; Observing the C.O. as
he emerged from the Galle Face at
Colombo the happy sergeant hailed him
with “G’day, you ruddy old tosspot!”
Which led to another sarg, being
dragged off his beer to escort the
offender back to the ship under arrest.
With his day cut short so abruptly the
prisoner had “plenty faloosh” left in his
kick, so he slipped his three-hooked mate
a fiver and hissed simply, “Get him rot-
ten!” That night the C.O. was invited
to the sergeants’ mess, and when he had
been brought to the stage of shouting
•the whole mess for the third time, in
the belief that it was still the first, the
day’s events were carefully breathed on.
Oozing bigheartedness, the C.O. de-
manded that the culprit—discreetly
parked in a corner —should be called to
join the party; a little later, when the
boss took his shoes off and hurled them
out the porthole, we knew that all was
forgiven.

“P.0.M.C.”: Vignette of the intersec-
tion of King and Castlereagh Streets at
high noon. A middy-sized black kitten
tumbled out of the pub, ambled across
the pavement like a crab, sidestepped
traffic which threatened to smear it over
the street any second and sat down
at the feet of the mighty. Taxi-drivers
“Shake it up, Parson — I've only got ten minutes' interval!"
making the'turn had a bit of fun at the
traffic-cop’s expense, one inquiring,
“Who’s yer offsider, Joe?” Then a
motherly soul jayed out from the crowd
on the kerb as brakes screeched, popped
the kitten into her string-bag and kept
going. It may have been highway rob-
bery in broad daylight, but nobody urged
the cop to make an arrest.

“Green Ink”: Old George had been a
two-pot drinker all his life, but on his
76th birthday we slipped a few more into
him and he began to throw his whole
nine stone about. Pot in hand, he faced
the boys: “Now look, you blokes, I’m
76 and I’ve never had a fight, so the first
bloke that starts anything’s going to cop
the lot.”

“Melbn”: This year’s Royal Show
in Melbourne is to be a centennial
celebration, and is to be on a
grand scale. Pageantry of the past
century will be revived in arena
events with old-time vehicles parading
with occupants in period costumes,
including mutton-chop whiskers, and
police and fire-brigades will illustrate
100 years of evolution in fighting fires
and two-up schools. The Fattest Lady
in the World will be fatter than ever and
the Tailed Man from Borneo will have
an extra foot or two of caudal append-
age. An attempt to improve the sump-
tuary regulations relative to women riders
came up against feminine opposition
and the difficulty of getting the correct
shape of hard-hitter. Caps may be worn
if bowlers are lacking.

“Laetitia”; At the Queensland public-
school which failed to educate me the
juvenile patrons of the pie-purveyor were
abandoned sauce-addicts (B. 30/6/’4B).
A momentary relaxation of the pieman’s
vigilance was the signal for upending of
the bottle’s contents down an adolescent
gullet. And could we put away pies?
One night a scion of the squattocracy
collapsed in a torpor. The malady was
a mystery to the staff, but not to those
who knew that Sheepshears had that
night, at the expense of 17 pies, eaten
himself into a place in the juvenile hall
of heroes,

“Clooter”: Any Queenslander con-
templating divorce had better think
again. Under a Supreme Court rule
solicitors’ fees are to go up by 20 p.c.
in the banana State, bumping the aver-
age cost of an undefended divorce suit
from 70 to 84gns. All-round increases
in the costs of labor, paper, preparation
of documents and so forth induced
Queensland Law Society to apply for the
increase, A good many years ago the
profession was granted a one-third in-
crease in fees, but in the depression it
was reduced by 20 p.c. Increases have
been granted in most of the other States,
which will probably prompt a lot of
people to agitate for two things—uni-
formity of laws and a reform and
simplification of the various statute-
books. What with modern transport and
other things, the average citizen is break-
ing some law or other all his waking
hours —in Sydney he’s breaking one if he
has a radiator on in his bedroom while
he sleeps.

“Norther”: Among the Federal Par-
liamentarians now infesting Queensland
in search of the sun is the P.M.G., who
no sooner hit Brisbane than he was
snared by a “Courier-Mail” reporter, who
found him “co-operative and informa-
tive,” and wheedled out of him the news
that Queensland is to get nearly
£6,000,000-worth of “postal rehabilita-
tion,” There are to be new automatic
exchanges at Woolloongabba, Fortitude
Valley, Ashgrove, Toowong, New Farm,
Chermside, Lutwyche, Sandgate, Towns-
ville, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Mary-
borough, Bundaberg and Mackay. It
was hinted, too, that a site for a new
post-office would be sought in Brisbane’s
Adelaide-street. You see, we have a de-
cided advantage in our winter climate —
the Canberra coves can’t keep away from
it, and when they come after it, being
sensitive about the Queensland vote,
they’re always full of promises. Natur-
ally the promises all have an “escape
clause.” In Senator Cameron’s case it was
“Progress has been retarded by the in-
ability of overseas contractors to supply
vital equipment” ; but, then, I suppose we
can’t have everything.

“Pitt St.”: A rather unique specimen
of Sydney tramguard was discovered
the other mornmg. Coming down
Oxford-street the tram developed a
hot-box, smoke rose into the compart-
ment and somebody called the conduc-
tor. The living counterpart of one of the
Cheeryble brothers, he looked in,
clambered through, inspected the source
of the smoke and then, with a beaming
smile, said, “There you are, customers,
a new foot-warmer service. If it works
we’ll be having hostesses serving hot tea
these mornings before you know where
you are. Now, will everybody remoye
themselves into the car ahead just in
case the new gadget gets too hot?”
Everybody did, and the morning seemed
somehow the brighter for the incident.

“Bybren”: “Bo’s” refreshment-room
spuds (B. 30/6/’4B), hard as they are,
would surely meet their match in those
gents who nonchalantly lift the tops from
beer-bottles with their teeth. I’ve often
marvelled at this feat without raising the
courage to attempt it myself. Still,
healthy teeth are immensely strong, and
with the human bite estimated at 170
pounds pressure and bites up to 270
pounds on record, maybe it’s not so
wonderful. If this knowledge fails to re-
store confidence to patrons of R.R.
rooms they should get in touch with the
Englishman who made himself a set of
“falsies” from an old aluminium crank-
case. Thus equipped, even if the spud
defied mastication, the teeth would have
a fair chance of getting through un-
scathed.

“Plop”: When my dry-cleaner began
adding shrinking to his other services I
decided to try a larger firm. I found
there a long counter with a dozen assist-
ants ; comptometers and typewriters
fought it out in the background ; there
was fluorescent lighting overhead, flood-
ing down on to a floorwalker with a car-
nation in his buttonhole —different from
“Scrubbo’s,” all right. I handed my par-
cel to the girl and found yet another
variation of about 100 per cent, in cost.
She broke the news sweetly, though, and
told me the pants would be ready on
Friday. This was service, I thought, the
ultimate in organisation. Then I read
the docket she’d given me:
1 pair grey trousers. Gab. Very stained
and soiled (plus 8). Try CPI solvent.
In their thoroughness' they had gone too
far, and I’m back with “ScVubbo’s” now.

“Lofty”: American “morticians” using
a Varga girl for an advertisement (B.
30/6/’4B) might attract attention, but the
pictured damsel would be more likely to
give a man a zest for life than encourage
him to die. A better advertisement line
was the one painted on a hearse: Why
go around- only half alive when we can
bury you for 65 dollars? ”
* * * •
“Pongo”: Old-time funeral fashions
(B. 30/6/’48)? When I was a lad not
only did male relatives of deceased wear
black arm- and hat-bands and black ties,
but the women arrayed themselves in
black for six months and for the next six
wore “half-mourning”—black and white
or grey. Hearses were awesome vehicles,
horse-drawn and surmounted by at least
eight sapling-sized sable plumes which
swayed with the motion of the hearse.
Corteges proceeded at walking-pace on
the outward journey, and a two-hours
trip was the rule. The undertaker wore
a bell-topper enveloped in sufficient crepe
to make a New-Look skirt. Those old-
timers took a great interest in their per-
sonal appearance and admired merit in
their calling. I once heard a couple of
“body-snatchers” discussing the passing
of a fellow-ghoul. Said one, “Good
bloke, Fred. Never saw anybody look
better on a hearse. Big black mo. Sat
straight and always was solemn.”
SMOKED SEAL.
“Smoked seal may soon be on sale in Melbourne
for human consumption.”
Smoked seal! Why not? It well may prove
delicious;
A vast improvement, too, one may remark,
On what we eat in fish-shops unsuspicious
And find both satisfying and nutritious,
To wit, fried shark.
Smoked seal! The very words sound appetising,
Unlike a lot wherewith we stoke our frames,
Its origin imperfectly surmising,
’Twill need no camouflaging or disguising
With fancy names.
Think of the humble and prolific coney,
How often his identity is sunk,
His pelt rechristened by some process phoney,
Concealed beneath a label rich and tony,
Musquash or skunk.
As for his flesh, the cook, if he’s a slick ’un
Can fix it up in pate or croquette,
Make it so tasty that there’s nought to quicken
Dim apprehensions that it isn’t chicken,
I’m game to bet.
But here’s a dish needs no’ description spurious
To recommend it. Who’s to say that seal,
Although its flavor seem a trifle curious,
Won t yet be billed as quite the least injurious
And m addition as the most luxurious
Part of a meal?

T HE SERVICE MAN
The Malayan Crisis.
“Ek Dum”: It seems that the
Australian Cabinet will not dis-
cuss the Malayan position be-
fore August 2, while in the
meantime Dr. Evatt debates it
with the Singapore and British
“authorities” to find out whether
it is serious and calls for Aus-
tralian help. Why this discus-
sion is necessary it is hard to
understand, since Mr. Chifley
himself has discussed the matter
both in London and Malaya
within the past week or two.
And Dr. Evatt vouches for it
that the Prime Minister is a man
who says “will” when he means
“will,” a stern character who
cannot be moved by threats.
This seems to put the position
clearly. All that is wrong about
the situation is that Mr. Chifley
apparently does not regard any
utterance by the Communists as
threats. They are merely “philo-
sophising.”
When the Communists have
demanded anything they have
got-it. When they have been
opposed to anything Mr. Chifley
has been opposed to it—or
silent. They don’t like Balts in
industry because the Russians
don’t like them. So Balts won’t
be allowed to go into heavy in-
dustry. They didn’t want the
Dutch supplied in Indonesia
when Russia was on the side of
the Japanese-organised partisans
and traitors, who are called by
courtesy “republicans,” so Mr.
Chifley, as long as this policy
pleased the Communist unions,
allowed it to be carried out.
/When Malaya was attacked in
December, 1941, there was no
talk of sending Dr. Evatt to dis-
cover whether its defence against
a savage enemy was important
to this country. The whole
world was agonised and decent
people of this country shamed
by the hysterical shrieks which
emanated from Canberra.
Messrs. Chifley, Curtin and
Evatt laid themselves out osten-
tatiously to put heart into a
supposedly cowardly lot of
British and to force action.
Dr. Evatt’s version then was
that the British Government
would soon learn that the de-
fence of Malaya was not a side-
show but “in truth the defence
of Britain, as well as the defence
of Australia.”
His then Prime Minister and
colleagues made it clear that
they believed Malaya was
“the bastion of Australia.” They
yelled for 25 divisions to de-
fend this country, since they be-
lieved that it was doomed to in-
vasion once Singapore had
fallen. They brought their troops
home from the Middle East at
such a breathless rate that they
would not even allow a division
to be left in Burma for three
weeks to save Rangoon. They
girded at Messrs. Churchill and
Roosevelt for dilatoriness until
those harried statesmen were
sick at heart.
They went pale at the “dis-
turbing reports from General
Bennett,” and they railed against
the steps which the unfortunate
British had taken 10,000 miles
from their bombed homeland,
then supporting five battlefronts
from its little islands.
Mr. Curtin told the British
fiercely that he would have no
“penny-packet dispositions,” and
demanded to be told at the
earliest convenience of their
Government what steps they
proposed to take. He called for
Russia to declare war on Japan,
but stopped when it was
found that it was unpopular
with Messrs. Thornton, Healy
and other officials of the then-
illegal Communist party. He
proclaimed that the evacuation
of Singapore would be an in-
excusable betrayal, and his in-
sistence on reinforcements being
sent there by the British, at a
moment when it was apparent
that Malaya must fall through
overwhelming Japanese num-
bers, if nothing else, led to the
sacrifice of the 18th British
Division, which could have been
used to save Rangoon.
The Canberra" Ministry was
odd man out all the tme. It in-
sisted that the danger of inva-
sion would remain until “stabi-
lised defence of the Malay
barrier” and naval superiority
were obtained.
Now the situation has
changed. The Communists —now
banned, along with their fellow-
traveller organisations, in
Malaya—are averse to defend-
ing Malaya from an incursion of
Chinese Communists. The
Malays are taking little part in
the affair. The Communist
party feels no qualms about the
murder of whites. They are the
agents of a savage semi-Asiatic
country which believes that it is
almost a disgrace to be a Wes-
tern European a disgrace
which can be redeemed only by
being a Communist,
What is happening has left
Canberra so unmoved that it is
deferring its “decision” until
Dr. Evatt has held talks abroad
and relayed the results back for
discussion at a Cabinet meeting
next week some time. Any-
thing may happen in a fortnight
to relieve the anxieties of a
trembling Ministry.
In actual fact there is no need
for a Cabinet meeting. Another
“Cabinet” has already met. Its
decision was published in the
Sydney “Tribune”;
Our troops must not help crush
Malayan liberty. Democratic Aus-
tralians have no wish to become
imperialist policemen denying in-
dependence to others, or to die in the
jungles of Malaya defending the pro-
fits of the Coffins House monopolists.
The big Australian Com-
munist-controlled union heads
are all on the side of the mur-
derers, and whatever the Aus-
tralian “Government” may
decide or profess to .decide
the certainty is that no merchant
ship will be allowed to carry
arms to Malaya, no transport-
worker to load them unless the
Government steps in and applies
compulsion.
Also, if they run true to form
shown in the Indonesian busi-
ness, the Chifleys will make no
move to force the situation.
Their automatic speech-equip-
ment will be in the “will not”
position until the crisis is over,
no matter what happens to Aus-
tralians and British in Asia.
It is a strange position that a
Prime Minister, who was so
moved (according to his own
flash of self-revelation in the
House of Representatives last
session) by the loss of merely his
job 30 years ago that he
vowed to devote his existence
to getting his own back
against those who “victimised”
him for breaking the law, should
react so mildly to the slaughter
of his own countrymen on a
foreign shore.
Two Statements on
Defence.
“Ek Dum”: Two statements
about defence appeared in the
Sydney press on July 24. The
first emanated from Mr. Cyril
Chambers, who is becoming
almost as eloquent and futile as
Mr. Frank Forde.
Parliament was solemnly
served with a defence plan last
year, and so far on the military
side not much has come of it.
The main development in Army
defence since then has been the
involuntary dwindling of the
8.C.0.F., which contains about
the only fighting battalions we
own. Mr. Chambers is now
happy to be able to announce
that the reduction of this body
of troops “from its present
strength of about 6000 to a
token force of 2000 is progress-
ing satisfactorily.”
The A.8.C., whicli is fond of
such pastimes, should put on a
quiz session to discover where
Mr. Chambers keeps his 6000
troops in Japan and how many
will be added to the present
brigade strengths to enable the
units to aggregate 2000.
However, when the troops
that aren’t there return to Aus-
tralia, if they belong to the
Regular Army, they will
become “the nucleus of a field
force.” “Nucleus” is probably
the right word if it is used in
atomic sense, there probably
being no smaller body within
the range of Mr. Chambers’s
vocabulary. However, it is pro-
posed that the force will be
built up “as recruiting for the
Australian Regular Army pro-
gresses.” If it continues to
progress as heretofore it will be
expanded into a molecule of a
force about the time Mr. Cham-
bers completes the 800th version
of the tour he is now making to
“review recruiting facilities in
the various commands” and to
“discuss with local commanders
any problems that may have
arisen on recruiting and military
training of the Australian Regu-
lar Army and Citizens Military
Force,”
He has a new defence
programme now “based on a
three-point plan” which will
provide armies ( a ) to be placed
at the disposal of the United
Nations for the maintenance of
international peace and security,
including regional developments
in the Pacific ; ( b ) to be main-
tained under arrangement for
“Hey, Bill: y' Wasn't told to paint the jigger' ead !”
co-operation in British Com-
monwealth Defence—it should
be noted that even this airy
promise is subject to the agree-
ment of the Communist Party
Central Committee, which has
become the most effective
“Cabinet” in Australia; (c) to
defend Australia.
So far there is no sign of
acquiring sufficient uniformed
personnel to do the paper work
for Mr. Chambers’s ambitious
armies, much less to fill their
ranks. Recruiting for citizen
staffs, however, booms. They
now number over 12,000.
The second statement on de-
fence is one which appears in
the “S. M. Herald”; that the
“United States, it is understood,
has in the last year shown reluc-
tance to reveal atomic-research
secrets to Australian scientists.”
And that “the Canberra Gov-
ernment is gravely concerned at
this reluctance.” It has been
learned (says the “S.M.H.”) on
the highest authority that Mr.
Chifley raised the subject during
his recent discussions with the
British Cabinet and had ad-
mitted to British Ministers
that Sir David Rivett had
earlier this year publicly ex-
pressed the opinion that the
C.S.I.R. should not be involved
in research of a secret nature.
The Prime Minister did not
say whether he told the Minis-
ters that his Government was
employing in the C.5.1.R., as a
political job, a defeated Labor
candidate who scarcely ever
spoke in the Federal Parliament
during his term of membership
save to blackguard decent people
under cover of privilege, to
sneer at Britain and laud the
Soviet Union. Neither does
he make it plain whether he
dilated on the fact that his Gov-
ernment also obstinately em-
ploys in the C.S.I.R. a Com-
munist convicted and jailed in
1940 of red-anting the civil de-
fence and passing on the infor-
mation to a Communist body
which was in communication
with the Comintern in an enemy
country, a man who has only
recently inveighed against the
measures which are being taken
for the defence of Australia be-
cause he thinks defence must
mean defence against Russia.
However, the “Herald” says
that Australia has tightened
security measures to protect the
rocket range in Central Aus-
tralia, but “the United States
authorities are understood to be
doubtful whether security meas-
ures are adequate in scientific
circles.”
Still Serious in Berlin.
“Ek Dum”; The situation in
Europe, despite the lull, or ap-
parent lull, goes from bad to
worse.
In its Premiership France has
replaced a strong man with a
sick man who, though a radi-
cal Left, is still a friend of the
Marshall Plan. But it looks as
if M. Bidault will have to leave
the Foreign Office, and the fact
that the Communists have unre-
lentingly voted against the new
Premier, M. Andre Marie, em-
phasises the fact that they feel
strong enough to play a waiting
game. The intrusion of Leon
Blum, now a doddering panta-
loon around the eighties, and
Reynaud, Premier of France at
the time of its surrender in
1940, have stimulated the hopes
of Moscow.
From behind the veil in Eas-
tern Europe reports continue to
come in of heavy movements of
Russian troops in the Danube
area along the natural route for
an invasion of Western Europe,
of which the core is the great
river and canal system giving
any army travelling from east to
west an axis of linked rail and
water transport all the way.
Then, too, it was reported
from both Turkey (where the
head of the Communist party
and 44 followers were jailed
last week) and Sweden, Russian
commands have been placed on
a war basis. The old com-
manders who disappeared from
sight a couple of years ago
are back. The redistribution of
military organisation was being
completed while General Soko-
lovsky, suddenly reappearing in
Berlin, gave a correspondent the
impression that the Russians
were about to weaken.
There is no sign of weaken-
ing on the Moscow front, where
the greatest air show on record
is being staged this 'freek with
thousands of military aircraft.
There is none in the Kremlin,
where Marshal Vassilevsky has
resumed his position as Chief of
the General Staff, nor in the
Balkans, where, despite the fact
that the Cominform has sup-
posedly expelled Marshal Tito
and banned all his works, that
gentleman set the Yugoslav
Communist conference ringing
with his protestations of loyalty
to the “Great Stalin” and to
Moscow and the C.S.P.B.U. (the
Russian Communist party). And
Marshal Zhukov has been ap-
pointed Commander-in-Chief of
Russian and, presumably, at
least Bulgarian, Hungarian and
Czech troops.
The first rumor of his appoint-
ment was followed immediately
by desperate purges in Hungary
and in Czechoslovakia much on
the lines of the Russian purge
of 1938. From Prague the
former Chief-of-Staff of the
Czechoslovak Army escaped to
tell the American press on land-
ing in New York last Friday that
the coup in Czechoslovakia last
February had been military
rather than political.
The northern flank of a cross-
Europe front has been handed
over, according to advice from
Turkey and Sweden, to Marshal
Rokossovsky. ' His command
goes down to the Austrian gate.
With the reports come others of
a stiffemng-up everywhere of
Russian discipline and changes
of command as far afield as
Vladivostok.
The Russians are going on
with their plans in Berlin. They
have offered to feed Western
Berlin. They have introduced
new permanent currency as the
only valid currency for Berlin.
Their Yaks permeate the air
route into Western Berlin and
occasionally pass over Allied
landing-grounds in squadrons
doing slow-rolls at 1500 ft. The
“Tagliche Rundschau,” the Rus-
sian organ, on July 25 fore-
shadowed the first move to close
the air route from the West to
Berlin by remarking that the
British aircraft flying the route
had committed “no fewer than
32 breaches of the air-safety
traffic regulations in three days,”
adding; “Soviet experts think
such lack of discipline can no
longer be tolerated.”
The American Ambassadors to
London (Mr. Douglas) and Mos-
cow (General Bedell Smith,
lately General Eisenhower’s
Chief-of-Staff) were in Berlin as
this was written to discuss the
situation with General Clay, the
U.S. Commander. The Russian
Radio and other agencies are at
pains to interpret this as a show
of weakness and a preliminary
to discussions between the Wes-
tern Powers and Russia on the
whole question of Germany. It
is suggested that this also is one
of the first signs of Western
capitulation.
Moscow’s main ambition at
the moment is a free hand in
Austria, Italy and the Middle
and Near East, and particularly
a hand in the control of the
Ruhr. If that could be obtained
the Kremlin would sit back and
wait its opportunity to extend
its present Berlin tactics west-
ward.

PERSONAL ITEMS
ln Melbourne after a spell in
ne diplomatic service, which he enjoyed
Hugely, is Sam Atyeo, the Victorian
artist who caused one of the biggest flare-
ups the National Gallery in Melbourne
nas ever had when he painted “Lot and
His Daughters” for the Travelling
ocnoiarship. The unconscious model for
Lot was the late Barnie Hall, the then
director, and the patriarch’s daughters
P° r * r^ ts °f Sam’s fellow-students.
When Barnie saw the outrage, which was
the first picture painted in the modern
manner by any Gallery student, he
ordered it to be removed to his private
study. Sam engaged two photographers
to help him recover it, put it in a truck
and took it to the “Herald” office, where
it was photographed for the evening
paper. It was then put on exhibition in
an art-craft shop, and half the art popu-
lation of Melbourne flocked to see it.
Atyeo has had a varied career since those
days. He has been architectural adviser
to a leading Melbourne industrialist and
a sort of cultural envoy on Dr. Evatt’s
diplomatic missions. He intends to re-
tire to a centuries-old farm he bought in
France. It is in good painting country,
and he will mix farming with picture-
making,
Adelaide can claim a foot or so in the
relay run from Mount Olympus to
London. Mediterranean Fleet frigate
Whitesand Bay was assigned to carry torch
and runner from Greece to Italy—the
Communist-dominated Balkans being bad
running country at present for athletes
wearing the wrong colors —and a naval
athlete, James Potter, got the job of re-
ceiving the torch at Corfu from the last
man in the Greek team, carrying it ashore
at Bari and handing it to an Italian runner
in the centre of the town. Potter, an air-
gunner of the Fleet Air Arm, is a son
of a Chesterfield couple who migrated to
South Australia two years ago.
Brigadier Frank Field, S.-w. Pacific
representative of the United Nations
International Children’s Emergency
Fund, is conducting the N.S.W. drive for
£1,000,000 in voluntary contributions.
English-born, he came to Australia in
1923, and is a retired brigadier of the
A.M.F. Asked to work on Army
mechanisation in 1924, he concentrated
on designs for new equipment suitable
for manufacture in Australia. Director
of Mechanisation from 1940 to 1943, he
raised the number of Australian Army
vehicles from 14,000 to 100,000. Later,
on Manpower Directorate, Field worked
out a programme switching industry over
from war- to peace-time activity. At
war’s end he joined U.N.R.R.A., and
was sent to Manchuria as Associate Field
Director. Five months later he moved
to Shanghai, and as deputy-director of
U.N.R.R.A.’s China Mission was re-
sponsible for a relief programme entail-
ing £182,000,000 in agricultural, industrial
and medical rehabilitation. In August
last year he retired from U.N.R.R.A.,
returned to Sydney and was called
for work in U.N.I.C.E.F. this year.
U.N.I.C.E.F.’s programme of relief to
230,000,000 children the world over de-
pends on two things—the amount forth-
coming from member-nations and the
speed at which supplies can be obtained
and shipped to needy countries.
Reginald Arthur West, who has retired
from the position of headmaster of
Adelaide High, had been teaching at that
seminary ever since it was opened—and
even before that, as he began his teaching
career at the old Pupil Teachers’ School,
which became High in 1908 when free
secondary education was introduced in
South Australia. He became head in
1920, succeeding Bill Adey, who had been
there from the beginning. Bora 66 years
ago at Woodville, then a sleepy village,
now the centre of Adelaide’s motor-body
industry, West won the Roby Fletcher
prize for Philosophy and Logic in 1902.
In his retirement he will watch with
interest the new Adelaide High rising on
the west parklands.
With the sudden death in Melbourne
of Air Vice-Marshal Stanley James
Goble, Australia loses a man who had
been prominent in the R.A.A.F, since
1921. He first became a public figure in
1924, when with Flight-Lieutenant Mc-
Intyre he made the first round-Australia
flight, using a Fairey seaplane, but he
already had a distinguished Great War
record behind him, with a string of
decorations to his credit. First with the
R.N. Air Service and later with the
R.A.F., he won- a D.S.C., D.S.O. and
Croix de Guerre, was twice mentioned
in dispatches and at the end of the war
was awarded an 0.8. E, After he trans-
ferred to the R.A.A.F. in 1921 he was
A.D.C. to the Governor-General for four
years—the flight with Mclntyre came
during that period—graduated at the
R.A.F. Staff College and the Imperial
Defence College, and held several high
positions, including Chief of Air Staff.
Soon after the outbreak of the later war
he was sent to Ottawa as Liaison-
Officer for Australia in the Empire Air
Training Scheme. He 9ame back to Aus-
tralia in 1945 and retired the following
year. Melbourne-born, he was 57.
“Thap”; Queensland agriculturists
have farewelled into retirement R, E.
Soutter, whose name is almost as much
a household word among Queensland
wheatfarmers as that of Farrer. Soutter
spent 50 years with the Agriculture De-
partment ; his interest in plant-breeding
goes back to his toddler days—his father
was at one time in charge of the Queens-
land Acclimatisation Society’s gardens.
Varieties of Soutter-bred grain-wheat in-
clude Puora—since 1942 the State’s most
popular wheat—Puglu, Flora, Seafoam
and Cedric ; his Warput is well known as
a hay-wheat. When Soutter speaks of the
local varieties they are always “Queens-
land-bred” wheats, and it is left to the
listener himself to find out that “Queens-
land-bred” i§ a synonym for “Soutter-
bred.”
A cold wind blew the Weather Man into
the Religious Editor’s room just after Heth
had walked in to borrow a pencil. From
private sources the Religious Editor knew that
the Weather Man, otherwise Bernard William
Newman, Deputy-director of Meteorology in
N.S.W., had been transferred to H.Q. in Mel-
bourne as Supervisor of Climatology; for per-
sonal reasons he was anxious to know what
sort of weather could be expected next day.
“Nice weather we’re having,” remarked the
Religious Editor. The Weather Man looked
completely noncommittal. Heth leaned against
a bookshelf and began to sketch. “You were
born, of course, in Sydney?” said the R.E.
“Wentworth,” said the W.M. “On the Dar-
ling?” “At the junction of the Murray and
the Darling.” Heth moved over to the news-
paper file. “You joined the Weather Bureau
in Sydney?” suggested the R.E. “In Adelaide
in 1917,” said the Weather Man. “What sort
of weather are we going to have' tomorrow?”
asked the R.E. “I was in Adelaide till nine-
teen thirty-five,” said the W.M., “except for
a couple of years in Melbourne. Then I came
to Sydney.” “Thirteen years in Sydney?” re-
marked the Religious Editor. “You must know
a lot about the weather here. I wonder what
sort we can”—— “In recent years,” said the
W.M., “we’ve installed a lot of new flood-
stations on the Northern Rivers.”
Heth moved to the window. “I suppose
weather-forecasting is a harder job in Sydney
than in Adelaide?” said the R.E. “They both
have their difficulties,” the W.M. told him.
“It looks like rain,” said the R.E. cunningly,
but the Weather Man ignored the remark and
CLIMATOLOGY.
continued. “Wires come in from hundreds of
stations, some of which are full climatological
stations, some from post-offices, others again
from private individuals.” Heth crept around
and began to sketch the Weather Man’s left
ear. ‘’From that information you compile
your weather reports?” asked the R.E. “Yes,
forecasts are issued every three hours.” “Talk-
ing of forecasts,” said the R.E., “what sort
of weather do you expect” “My new job
will be a bit different,” continued the W.M.
“Weather is a day-to-day affair; climate is more
of a long-range business.” Heth pocketed his
pencil and crept out. The Weather Man rose
to depart, his face as inscrutable as an isobar.
The Religious Editor decided on a frontal
attack. “Will it be fine tomorrow?” he asked.
“It’s been a pleasure meeting you,” said the
Weather Man as he shook hands and walked
out. The following day was Sydney’s coldest
for 76 years and tiny flakes of snow were
fluttering down outside the Religious Editor’s
window when Heth brought in his chart of
the Weather Man, isobars and all.
Training technicians at Fishermen’s
Bend, Melbourne, for the new Austra-
lian car is Stephen J. Kaiser, the first
American master-mechanician to help the
Australian industry. His surname has for-
tunate associations for getting things done.
Of Austrian parentage, he was with the
Chevrolet people for 21 years, during
which time production jumped from 10
cars a day to five a minute. He has had
previous experience in putting a new
model into production; he helped to re-
vive the Opel Motor Co. in Germany in
1935. During the war he was concerned
in producing diesel and aircraft engines
for Uncle Sam. He is assistant to the
manufacturing manager at General
Motors-Holdens.
Few Australians have a wider acquain-
tance with the horticultural world than
William Austin Comeadow, here depicted
by Mcßeath. Since he took over as hon.
secretary of the Royal Horticultural
Society in 1943 it has been brought to
the position of the largest body of its
kind in the Southern Hemisphere, with
nearly 100 affiliated societies. Besides
this he helps to superintend University
Extension lectures, writes and broadcasts
on a variety of subjects, from compost
to plant hormones, lectures and judges

school shows of horticulture, wins gar-
den competitions himself, and works four
acres of garden in the moist soil of
Sassafras where exotic plants of all de-
scriptions are grown to perfection. His
work amongst' plants is amateur and
honorary, but he runs, in addition, the
business of Printers Pty. and Archer’s
Printery in Melbourne. In his youth
Comeadow was a long-distance runner—
he won the Essendon five-mile and Bruns-
wick three-mile —and studied art and
singing. He won the George Verdon
prize for drawing and design and was
prizewinner at the Ballarat and A.N.A.
competitions in the days when John
Brownlee and Florence Austral were
competing. He was first tenor in the
old champion male quartet “The Seren-

Keith Dodgshun, MX.A. for Rainbow,
Vic., was recently the victim of a conflict
when he had to meet a deputation from
the Primary Producers’ Union asking
for the liquidation of galahs because of
the damage they did to crops, and on the
same day, as Chief Secretary, had to give
notice in the Assembly of a bill to forbid
the shooting of galahs and pigeons over
traps. As Chief Secretary he told the
union that galahs must not be shot, and
as a farmer at Hopetoun in the Mallee
he wished they could be. Last year he
lost 140 acres of wheatcrop from the
birds’ depredations. Since 1938 Dodg-
shun has been deputy-leader of the
Country party. He is a sharp debater
and is quick in retort. He was a gunner
in the 1914 war.
In the dear old days of pre-1939 some
dear old cattle-breeding gentleman at
some cattle-breeders’ function said what
many dear old gentlemen often say:
“Why don’t the young men come forward
instead of sitting back criticising us?”

Grenfell and got himself elected presi-
dent of the N.S.W. Branch of the Short-

a brother and is yctung enough to possess
an infectious enthusiasm for the red,
white and liver-colored beasts and a
desire to push the interests of Shorthorn
breeders for all he is worth. An old boy
of King’s School and a player in its
Ist XI, he was helping his mother run
the Grenfell stud when war broke out.
He went overseas with the 2/9 Field

mother, took charge of the stud with his
brother. Weddin has just acquired an
asset in Aldsworth Prince Arthur, a roan

Lewis Deer, dead in Sydney at 81, was

Department for many years before he
turned to journalism. He was first a
teacher, then in turn publicity officer to
the Minister for Education, chief of the
department’s statistical branch and Chief
Inspector of the Public Service Board.
He joined the literary staff of “Smith's
Weekly” in 1922, and later became first
editor of the “Daily Guardian.” In re-

Women's Letters
From Sydney
Sons and daughters of Belgium living
in Sydney did not forget their National
Day, but commemorated it with joyous
reunions. One of the happiest of these
was the reception given by the Minister
of Belgium, Mr. Paul B. Verstraeten.
From five onwards the ballroom of the
Australia was thrown wide to a stream of
Belgian guests and their Australian
friends. Besides the centre buffet there
were many small tables set about the
room, and on each bloomed yellow and
red flowers. At the end of the room
dominating all was the flag of Belgium.
On the principal buffet was an epergne
decked and filled with red and yellow
flowers and cascading with black ribbons.
To receive the guests the Minister was
assisted by attache P. Anciaux Henry de
Faveaux and his wife. Madame de
Faveaux, who is dark-haired and dark-
eyed, wore platina-fox fur cape with her
ankle-length frock of black taffeta. The
party had a very diplomatic flavor.
Ministers, Consuls-General and represen-
tatives of every country having an
embassy in Australia came to pay their
respects. France’s Consul-General de la
Croix was there with Mme. de la Croix.
Greece came in the person of its Consul-
General, Vrisakis, and Mrs. Vrisakis.
Minister for Norway, Lars J. H. Jorstad,
and his sparkling wife were among the
noted. Everywhere smiled Consular
importants.
The Governor’s daughter, Elizabeth
Northcott, wore an attractive grey fitting
coat and small braided hat of the same
shade. Mrs. Henri Segaert, whose
husband had been for so long Consul-
General for Belgium, came with daughter
Mrs. F. Coss. Also noted were U.K.
Trade Commissioner Adams and Mrs.
Adams, and the senior Trade Commis-
sioner, Mr. Greaves, and his wife. U.S.
Acting-Consul-General Knowlton V.
Hicks, Canadian High Commissioner’s
wife, Mrs. Green, were there. Lieut.-
General Berryman’s wife was smart in
black suit and platina-fox furs. The
Harry Moxham lady was another who
chose black in suit and hat. Mrs. L. A.
Robb’s hat was black, upswept of brim
and glittered with a diamond clasp.
Melbourne artist Reshid Bey began his
Sydney visit inauspiciously. He came in
on an early-morning plane feeling him-
self full of ’flu, cold or call it
what you will. One of his first
visits was to the chemist. As he ap-
proached the counter the proprietor ob-
served, “Ah, the hangover, I pre-
sume,” and began to be busy among the
bottles. But, “Hold!” cried the artist.
“It is a cold I suffer from.” The chemist
thereupon got busy and compounded
another draught, and Reshid Bey was on
deck, the glow of health in his cheek, by
the hour of the welcome to a Sydney
party given by proxy by his mother-in-
law, Mrs. Gordon Chirnside, who was
unable to come up from Melbourne.
This party was in the Gloucester Room
of the Australia, and was very Darling-
pointish. It was also very merry and
bright after his new Sydney friends
learned that Bey was a title, and that
they addressed their host as Reshid Bey,
not as some of them had been inclined
to mutter, “Mr. Bey.” The artist’s mother
was one of a well-known Melbourne
family. His father is Turkish, a diplo-
mat, and famed as a portrait-painter in
Paris, London and now in Melbourne.
Melbourne guests at the five-thirty on-
wards included R. Nelkin, who proudly
proclaimed ownership of both Reshid
Bey’s and his father’s paintings.
From Adelaide came Lady Sowden,
whose husband was one-time newspaper
magnate of the South. With her were
her sister Mrs. Victor Raves and art-
lovers the John Cuttles. Budding poet
Jim Alison, librarian at Maitland, was
another sherry-sipper. Rosemary Budge,
who did the publicity for the artist’s
Sydney season, glowed in a camel-hair
top-coat of the softest rose pink with
beret to match. The H. C. Osbornes,
Roger Barry, Wal Taylor and Lex Ren-
toul, who gave another party at the same
address for his Melbourne friend, were
there, Mrs. Lennox Bode’s hat, black vel-
vet and befeathered, had a touch of the
elegance seen in a Du Maurier drawing.
The Ernest Watts were there, the popu-
lar Ernest holding levee all to himself.
Mrs. Gwen Spencer, who acted as hostess,
wore a graceful black frock served with
three layers of pearls and a small flower-
decked hat gay as spring.
Owing to continued ill-health over the
past 12 months Sydney Ure Smith has
resigned the presidency of the Society of
Artists after 26 years of devotion to the
art of this country. Perhaps the next time
there is an Honors List compiled some-
body will remember to class him up
among the knights at least. He is fol-
lowed as president of the S.O.A. by
Douglas Dundas, a painter whose works.
eS p ec j a py those of the Australian scene,
have been mucb admired since his earliest
exhibits. He has studied a great deal in
p aris> in Italy an d i n England. He is

Wal Taylor’s Grosvenor Galleries were
crowded out on to the landing at the
opening of painter Reshid Bey’s exhibi-
tion, The minute this Letter saw Mrs.
M. S. Darling, who buys pictures with
the avidity with which other women buy
hats, she knew that bang would go one
red seal on to a frame. Black-and-white
artist Jimmy Bancks opened the show,
which is really lovely—mostly flower-
pieces, and if you hadn’t read the notes
on the catalogue you’d have guessed that
Reshid Bey had studied in Paris. His
camellias express warmth and affection
as well as romance. Great attention was
bestowed on the portrait of the artist’s
wife and that of his! father. Fashion
surged into the gallery. All the people
who were at the party the day before
came again.
Mrs. Ernest Watt’s grey suit of light-
weight woollen was worn with a large
off-the-face grey hat. Red flashed the
pheasant’s feather that arched Mrs. Mari
Livingstone’s small brown hat ; her suit
was in the same shade of cocoa-brown.
Brown and black were effective in Mrs.
Jim Coleman’s outfit. Jean Cheriton was
distinctive in Parma-violet. Navy, with
a touch of white, was Mrs. Jimmy
Bancks’s choice. Mrs. E. A. Machin,
from Melbourne, was an admirer. An
outsize in red-and-black pom-poms
nodded blithe in the small black hat
worn by Mrs. Muriel Mackay. Mr.
Nelkin, the Kater lady, Mrs. Minton-
Taylor, Mrs. Jack Sinclair and Mrs. W.
Buckle were other admirers.
Friends of Mrs. H. P. Christmas were
shocked and sad to hear of her sudden
death last Thursday. Only the day before
she had spent the afternoon tending the
garden of her Palm Beach home.
The music circle of the English-
Speaking Union held an afternoon
concert in Anthony Horderns’ Fine
Arts Gallery to swell the funds of the
Lute Drummond testimonial. Lute and
her pupils had so often supplied the
programme for this circle that every
member feels herself a close friend and
every member not laid low with ’flu was
in the audience. The singers and
musicians also were friends of Miss
Drummond, so what the atmosphere on
that bleak winter day lacked in warmth
was made up in friendliness.
Mrs. Harry Twigden, director of the
music circle, Mrs. Persia Porter, Mrs.
Eva Rutherford and Miss Violet Hamblin
were the afternoon’s hostesses. From
Melbourne came Mrs. H. J. Brady’s
black-cloth coat and large black hat, up-
swept of brim. Good-looking Mrs. A. E.
Grace was guest-of-honor. Singers Carrie
Lancely and Gladys Verona were others
in the audience.
The speaker of the afternoon
was Josephine Marks. Mrs. Wallace
Turner, who was for so long the secretary
of the E.-S.U., and is now busy in Bowral,
sent a cheque to the fund, and with it a
letter about Lute that anybody would be
pleased to put in her cuttings-book.
Visiting Polish conductor Paul Klecki
was welcomed by the committee of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra last week.
The reception was in the Royal Empire
Society’s rooms, and although the tem-
perature was all winter (it was one of our
coldest days), the flowers were all spring.
North Shore line gardens had been rifled
for the occasion, and the air was positively
drenched with the scent from a great bowl
overflowing with daphne. For the first
time Mrs. Hope Gibson was absent,
owing to an unwelcome visit of influenza
in her home. The Walter Swinsons were
there, and the Francis Anderson lady.
Mrs. Sydney Herring, Mrs. Claude Plow-
man and Mrs. Rupert Scammell were
among the flower-brmgers.
Mrs. G. R, Strachan, hon. director of
Red Cross branches, has been elected
vice-chairman of the New South Wales'
Division of Australian Red Cross. Mrs.
Strachan, who serves on the junior
Red Cross, the library, the special appeals
committees and the finance committee of
the flower festival, is also a member of
the council of the Bush Nursing Associa-
tion.
From Melbourne
At the Australian-American Associa-
tion’s afternoon-tea party at the Australia
plans were discussed covering proposed
tours for the rest of the year. These in-
clude visits to the War Widows’ Craft
Guild, Murray Downs, where they
hope to see the shearing, the hydro-
electric and the pottery works at Bendigo.
The president, Mrs. R. G. Casey, chose
a black wool suit and a matching hat,
with earmuffs of black niched ribbon.
Rhoda Taylor was smart in a black coat
with a black scarf around her head, a la
French mannequin. Mrs. lan Potter wore
a biscuit-toned suit with a matching hat
trimmed with sweeping black feathers.
Mrs. O. Lampard’s black tailored suit
was worn with a small black satin off-
the-face hat tied under the chin with veil-
ing. Mrs, N. Kellow, who recently re-
turned from America, wore an American
gabardine suit in turquoise-blue; the
neck and wrists finished with frillings of
cream marquisette; her accessories were
all in strawberry tonings.
The Church of the Immaculate Con-
ception, Hawthorn, was venue for the
wedding of Margaret, younger daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. E. H. Christian, of
Kew, to Leon, only son of the late Mr.
and Mrs. Massoni, formerly of Melbourne.
Margaret’s lovely gown was of French
brocade; a filmy tulle veil fell from a
coronet of orange blossoms. Sister Jean
was bridesmaid and best man was David
Triaca. The reception, held at 14 Queens-
road Private Club, was attended by 200
guests. Mrs. Joseph Nassary wore a
“new-look” frock of blue jersey, matched
by her swathed turban. Mrs. Ralph
Grosby’s black frock was of ballerina
style. Former French mannequin Lydia
Le Plat, now Mrs. John Pitman, wore a
striking black taffeta ballerina frock and
a platina-fox bolero ; her small hat was
of black velvet and trimmed with jet
beading. Joan Harvey covered her hair
with a black sari to match her black
marquisette ballerina frock, Leon and
Margaret motored to Sydney for their
honeymoon.
Mrs. Desmond Hollywood was hostess
at a pre-wedding shower-tea at Menzies"
for Faye Raphael, who was married on
Saturday at Christ Church, South Yarra,
to Ricky Josephson, of Sydney. The
hostess wore a cocoa-brown lightweight
woollen frock with a matching coat and
brown-fox collar ; her small blue off-the-
face hat featured flower-trimming. Faye
chose a black jacket-suit trimmed with
Persian-lamb. Her sister Yvonne’s deep-
green velvet suit was highlighted with a
coffee-toned lace jabot. Mary Holland,
just returned from Colombo, wore a tur-
quoise-and-fawn check coat and a hat
of brown velvet which had feather pom-
poms for trimming. Pauline Cresse was
in a fawn suit with brass-button trim-
mings ; a long quill adorned her small
brown hat. Mrs. John Harrison chose a
green ensemble. Her sister Loris Nettle-
berg wore a black coat and a Patou pink
hat.
While Melbourne shuddered with the
cold, Mildura was flooded with glorious
sunshine. Escapists from Melbourne to
this delightful city by the placidly-flowing
Murray included Mrs. A. Johns, who
spent most of her leisure hours on
the golf course; Mrs. Donald Farquhar,
who came with her husband from the bay-
side resort of Rosebud; and Mrs. L. T.
Currie, wife of Dr. Currie, of Fairfield,
who was in the dried-fruits capital help-
ing son Robert celebrate his 21st birth-
day—he is a first-year med. student at
Mildura Uni,. Tasmania was represented
by Mr. and Mrs. E. Ross, who paused
there for a few days while passing
through to Adelaide.
Guest-of-honor at a late-afternoon
party given by Mrs. Fred Shilliday, of
Mildura, was Elizabeth Taylor, who is
country organiser for the Red Cross
“Miss Australia” Quest. The hostess was
tailored in grey. Elizabeth chose a navy
wool jacket-suit which had a large bow
of pink-and-white candy-striped silk.
Among the guests were Mrs. D. M.
Seeley, whose grey suit was worn with a
gaily-striped blouse, and Mesdames Owen
Kew, J. H. West and K. Kelly.
Setting of the dinner-dance sponsored
by the Jessie Henderson Auxiliary to the
Melbourne District Nursing Society was
the Venetian Court of the Australia, made
gay with bowls of autumn flowers and
foliage. Secretary Mrs. Ronnie Nott wore
a soft-blue satin gown, with drapery at
the sides adorned with bows of contrast-
ing satin; a silver-studded sari covered
her hair. Mrs. Arthur Laver’s gown of
pastel-blue satin had an off-the-shoulder
bodice allied to a full, sweeping skirt.
Mrs. Tom Farrell’s gown was of black net
over taffeta. Mrs. Bill McGownan’s
bouffant brown-net gown was worn
over pink taffeta; the off-the-shoulder
bodice was highlighted with a scarf
of pink tulle. Mrs. Frank Lonie
chose blue brocaded satin. Mrs. Arnold
Henderson’s black moire taffeta gown
had a full skirt and draped bodice.
Among those who worked during the
night disposing tickets for worth-while
gifts were Mrs. Lionel Newton, whose

and Mrs. Vernon Jones in orchid-mauve
chiffons. Mrs. Gordon Challingsworth’s
slim-fitting draped gown was of char-
treuse-yellow crepe rqmaine. Mrs. Frank
May favored green satin. Mrs. J. E.
Shilliday’s cyclamen crepe gown was

foamy beige lace, Betty Jones’s ballerina
gown was of aqua-blue net. Marjorie
Spry’s ballerina frock featured a tulle
skirt and off-the-shoulder black velvet
bodice.
This photo, of Mrs. Lionel Newton
was taken at the Jessie Henderson
Auxiliary dinner-dance. Mrs. Newton
has worked for the Melbourne District
Nursing Society for some years—with her
car she calls for and takes to hospital
women who have no means of transport
and who are too sick to travel by train
or tram. Y.W.C.A. is another of her
interests —at present she is busy on the
committee which is arranging a concert
in the Town Hall for Y.W. funds. Her
Toorak home is the scene of many de-
lightful parties, mostly for charitable
organisations. Her good works, plus two
small granddaughters, keep Mrs. Newton
busy.

Interest in this London-controlled co.’s
scrip has been stimulated by big mine-
development, mill-expansion and prospect-
ing programmes and marked extension of
interests through investment in other cos.
At Dec., 1947, there was £1,534,045 of
capital to feed in 737,076 5} p.c. cum.
prefs., half redeemable (co.’s option) at
par after the end of 1950, and 470,400
ords., all of £1 each, and 635,138 10s,
ords. The 10s. shares are to be raised to
£1 each by capitalisation of reserves
created for the purpose ; meanwhile they
rank equally in all respects with the f.-p.
pound ords.
The steep rise in earnings over the last
three years is due mainly to rocketing of
overseas metal prices. The overall ster-

at ceiling figures) received were:

Australia’s lead requirements (over 40
p.c. of total production) are met at £A22
a ton, the figure fixed in Feb., 1940, and
now less than half total cost of produc-
tion, Similar remarks apply to zinc, for
which the local ceiling is also £A22 a
ton. British and other overseas pur-
chasers are thus heavily subsidising Aus-
tralian consumers of the two metals, as
well a§ providing divs. for shareholders.
During die current term more lead is to
be sold in U.S. to help relieve the dollar
famine.

helped to swell earnings, too, and so did
improved mill efficiency—recoveries were
97.1 p.c. lead, 93.8 p.c. silver and 89.8
p.c. zinc. Of the year’s crudes 10 p.c.

own ore to Z.C.’s mill for treatment.

ord. share. The declared (gross) rate of

ducting English tax of 9s. in the £) were

a margin of 2s. 8.4 d. a share between last

The drill has disclosed a lot more high-
grade ore in deeper (undeveloped) areas
—“particularly encouraging” results have
been obtained at 3080 ft.
The co. is also making a wide geo-
physical and geological survey of the
Broken Hill field, is examining mineral
prospects in Queensland and other States,
and, in conjunction with strong overseas
interests, is on the hunt for natural gas
(between the Barrier and Flinders
Ranges) and oil (in the north and nor’-
west of Australia),
The new offshoot. Broken Hill Corp.
(paid capital £3,000,000 in 1,000,000 4j-
p.c. cum. prefs., redeemable at 21s. each
after 1956, and 2,000,000 ords.), took over
most of the parent’s holdings in associated
cos., thus separating its mining activities
at the Barrier from its other interests.
The consideration was £2,250,000 in scrip
—250,000 prefs. and the balance ords.
After paying the subsidiary’s preliminary
exes. (£67,476) the profit on the deal was
£1,190,059, which was added to reserves.
The parent sold 244,900 of the prefs.
before the close of accounts. The sub-
sidiary’s two largest holdings are 700,000
£1 shares in B.H. Associated Smelters
(unlisted) and 951,959 ss. stock units
(priced at 51s. 6d. each in the market) in
New Broken Hill Consolidated, which
paid a maiden 20 p.c. div. (11 p.c. net)
since the close of accounts.
The Z.C.-N.B.H.C, 10-year joint pro-
duction programme, now in its third term,
aims at lifting combined ore output of the
two mines to 1,000,000 tons p.a. by 1955.
Aggregate outlay on additional plant, de-
velopment, transport, smelting and other
services involved is expected to approach
£7,000,000. Z.C.’s expenditure on plant
alone totalled £411,564 over the last two
years.

Bigger allowances for taxation, royalties,
welfare, etc., and surplus earnings are
reflected in a growth of £1,103,832 in
Government securities, cash, etc. The
increase of £1,029,009 in shareholdings
is on account of the new subsidiary
already referred to. Whether the co. can
finance its Broken Hill programme out
of earnings depends largely upon the
trend of metal prices and costs. The im-
mediate outlook favors maintenance of
high prices, but how long they will con-
tinue nobody can say at the moment.
Since close of accounts the co. bought
all the ords. in Imperial Smelting Corp.,
the big English holding co. with a paid
capital of £4,637,226 in 2,069,809 6 i p.c.
prefs. and 2,567,417 ords. The basis of
the deal was one f.-p. £1 Zinc ord. for
every five £1 Imperial ords. When the
offer was made London prices for the
scrip were Zincs 1255. 4d. (stg.) and
Imperials 235. 3d. (stg.). Z.C. already held
about £104,000 of Imperial’s capital. As-
suming this was on the ord. register, the
deal will add £492,683 to Z.C.’s paid
capital. For the year to June 30, 1946,
I.S.C. netted £150,086, of which pref.
div. and 5 p.c. (2| p.c. net) to the ords.
took £143,775. Chief subsidiary is
National Smelting Co., which operates
big zinc smelting and acid works in
Britain. Other satellites include a num-
ber of pigment and allied cos.
More recently B. H. Corp. has offered
to buy all scrip in Sulphide Corp.
(paid capital £1,050,000 in 600,000 £1
10 p.c. non-cum. participating prefs. and
a like number of 15s. ords.). The price
is £1,200,000 (stg.) cash—27s. 6d. prefs.
and 12s. 6d. ords. Before announcement
of the offer, which expires on July 30, the
prefs. fetched 255. and the ords.
10s. 6d. each in the Australian market.
Sulphide is London-controlled, but its
cement, super, and acid works are at
Cockle Creek (N.S.W.). With plant work-
ing at less than two-thirds capacity, the
co. netted £15,137 last term. The prefs.,
which recently turned down a reconstruc-
tion proposal, got 6 p.c.; the ords. have
gone hungry since 1937.
On the Australian market Z.C. ords.
fetch £8 10s. or thereabouts, the redeem-
able prefs. 255. sd. and the other prefs.
345.

For a long time the policy was to dis-
tribute profits as they were earned. Share-
holders, however, never received much in
the way of dividends—an average of 3.6
p.c. over the last 20 years, sweetened,
except in lean times, with annual rebates
of commissions in the form of bonuses
to clients until 1941. Then it was decided
to strengthen the support and assistance
for capital, and the bonus to clients was
dropped.
With shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined) and £84,217 be-
sides represented by freeholds, etc., alone
at end March last, the co. is necessarily a
heavy borrower:

The outside debt was reduced by £307,495
net last term. There was a contraction of
£522,949 in the amount coming to sundry
creditors, etc. —large amounts due to
clients were held on deposit at the close
of accounts in 1947. To meet the with-
drawals, etc., the co. went to its bankers
for an extra £215,454, and was able to re-
duce book debts by £269,588, to
the season and prices. When the books
last closed, liabilities exceeded more-or-
less liquids by £62,216, an improvement
of £6597 over the twelvemonth.
Australia’s cheque for last season’s
wool clip was a record £155,547,893 (up
£63,211,953). The co., which operates
mainly in the west and sou’-west of
N.S.W. and over the border in Vic., and
holds a substantial interest in Nenco,
pioneer Newcastle woolbrokers, put an
extra 7683 bales under the hammer;

Sheep and cattle sales dropped by 29,818
head and 274 head respectively, but prices
rose. Gross earnings (£211,031) stepped
up £35,038, and exes. (£193,883) took
£25,905 of the gain, leaving the net result
(£17,148) £9133 better at 5.7 p.c. on
capital,, compared with 2.6, 3,4, 5.7, 4.2
and 4.2 p.c. back to 1942. A point was
added to the div., making it 4 p.c.
There are no signs at the moment of
a serious setback in either demand or
prices, and another good season is in
prospect. Marshall aid promises to be
a temporary prop to European buying,
and the appearance of Russia and prob-
able early entry of Japan into the market
are other encouraging features. Mount-
ing costs,, high taxation and scarcity of
labor and materials are the ugly ducklings.
The market prices the f.-p. pound
shares, which have long-term possibilities,
at 18s., at which figure the return is 4.4
p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. Cover is
28s. Id. in net tangibles.

The music trade was still depressed and
over-competitive in 1936, and Nicholson’s
had recorded losses for the five preceding
terms when its trading affairs were passed
over to a subsidiary which also absorbed
the Sydney branch of Allan and Co. Pty.
An unusual feature of this subsidiary
(Nicholson’s Pty.) is its capital structure:
20,000 A prefs. and 67,991 B prefs. are
geared to a nominal issue of seven ords.
—all shares of £l. The A prefs. belong
to Allan and Co. Pty. (this firm remains
a power on its own account in Melbourne
music business), and Nicholson’s Invest-
ments holds one ordinary and all the B
preference shares, which apparently don’t
stand in anybody’s way.
There is no ceiling dividend rate on
the B. prefs., which are “cumulative to
p.c.” Nothing less than that has been
paid so far by the subsidiary, and the
improved profit of Nicholson’s Invest-
ments last year resulted from a 15 p.c.
receipt (£7650), compared with 121 P-c-
-in 1947 and 10 p.c. in the four previous
terms.
The net return over the past five years
from the holding co.’s other assets —free-
holds and Commonwealth bonds —has
oscillated only slightly around the mean
of £5083 (after £2710 average tax pro-
vision). Rentals are collected —mainly
from the subsidiary—for the seven-floor
building in George-street, which was re-
built in up-to-date style after the 1940
fire. The taxable return from rents
represents about 41 p.c. on this property’s
cost value.
Consolidated balance - sheet figures
aren’t published, and those given for the
holding co. alone are, naturally, some-
what imperturbable:

Last term the subsidiary’s turnover was
24 p.c. higher than in 1947, says the
board, whilst a further 33 p.c. rise has
occurred in the first quarter of the pre-
sent term. Stocks are improving, but costs >
are on the increase. The subsidiary has
been making “substantial” additions to
reserves in recent years.
A one-point rise in the holding co.’s
distribution would call for an extra
£2191, On the basis of the last div. yield
from the fully-paid shares is 4.8 p.c. at
current price of 21s. 3d.; the shares have
net tangible cover of 21s, 7d., including
6s. Id. for the subsidiary shares.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"Hamlet."
Laurence Olivier’s “Hamlet,”
current at Sydney Embassy, was
reviewed here in B. 23/6/’4B.
Since it has been cut from a
four-hour play to a two-and-a-
half-hour film; since Rosen-
crantz, Guilderstern, Fortinbras
and others have gone ; since the
soliloquy, “Oh, what a
rogue ” has been dropped ;
since some of the lines of mis-
sing characters have been
allotted to others ; since scenes
and lines -have been transposed
—since all that and more has
been considered necessary in the
filming, there is. room for
volumes of argument. To avoid
them it is necessary to consider
the production simply as a film
and to accept, however reluc-
tantly, the inevitability of the
alterations, omissions, etc. Tak-
ing it that way, the only ques-
tion left is: is it, as films go, a
good one? The answer, of
course, is that it’s excellent.
Olivier’s Hamlet is reduced
to comparatively simple terms —
a Hamlet obsessed with the idea
of revenge for his father’s mur-
der and with horror at his
mother’s early and “incestuous”
remarriage to his father’s
brother and murderer. There are
overtones of an CEdipus complex
in his embraces with his mother,
but they are so slight as to be of
little or no significance in the
film. If, in the film, k vigorous,
forthright, leaping Hamlet is not
altogether reconciled with an
introspective, hesitating avenger
at least both characteristics are
there, unexplained but made
credible by the force of Olivier’s
performance.
Olivier’s voice and wonder-
ful acting explore the charac-
ter from a dozen approaches—
his tender passing concern for
Polonius, his exchanges with
Stanley Holloway, the grave-
digger, and the gentleness of his
words over Yorick, his vigor in
the final duel, and, above all, his
tremendous fury, hatred and
love as he strips away his
mother’s mental defences.
Eileen Herlie is a beautiful,
voluptuous and, therefore, cred-
ible queen ; Basil Sydney an ex-
cellent king; Felix Aylmer a
standard Polonius, Jean Sim-
mons an Ophelia lost and be-
wildered in the storm of emo-
tions around her, and Norman
Woodland an Horatio whose de-
livery of “Good-night, sweet
prince” (the last words in the
film) are the most beautifully-
spoken lines in the production.
The camera, in its exploration
of sea and mist, and of the cold
wet stones of Elsinore, often
says as much as the actors, but
it says less than Shakspeare, and
one cannot help feeling that
there could have been more of
the play and less photographic
indulgence. Still, although it
loses much in Alan Dent’s distil-
lation, the tragedy also gains
something, almost as though its
dramatic force and intensity
were increased by the restriction
—like compressing an explosion.
"Les Enfants du
Paradis. "
This French film at the Mel-
bourne Australia and Sydney
Variety tells of the havoc
wreaked in the lives of three
men by the beautiful but none-
too - circumspect Gara n c e.
Garance loves Baptiste, the
clown, and he loves her;
Frederick, the small-part actor,
also loves her but she doesn’t
love him, and, in the tangle, the
wealthy Count de Montray gets
her.
After five years in a gilded
cage as the Count’s mistress she
returns to Paris to find both her
former lovers famous and the
clown married. Her arrival stirs
up all the ancient hatreds, there
are a duel and a murder, and
Garance finally performs the
usaul act of renunciation by
walking out, followed by the
infatuated Frederick, who loses
her in a crowd of merrymakers.
The polished acting of Arletty,
Jean-Louis Barraud and Pierre
Brassier, the brilliant recreation
of the Parisian theatre of the
forties and French sophistication
fail to conceal the fact that the
plot is one of the hoariest in
dramatic history and that the
film lacks the penetration of
Jean-Paul Sartre’s “Pastoral
Symphony,” and doesn’t justify
its three hours’ running time.
Brahms and
Khachaturian.
Comrade Aram Khachaturian,
whose Second Symphony was
given its first Australian per-
formance by the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra last week
under Eugene Goossens, was the
subject of a recent purge by the
Politburo. Various reasons have
been adduced, except the two
most likely ones: that Joe had
to listen to the dissonances of
the composer’s “Poem for
Stalin,” or that Khachaturian
unaccountably failed to pro-
vide for a kitchen sink in
the percussion section of the
score of his Second Symphony.
Apparently the Soviet-Arme-
nian “composer,” angered at his
own inability to infuse into the
“Train ’em this Way and they NEVER fall”
symphony anything in the nature
of a melody, decided to take it
out on the audience by concen-
trating on the cymbals. Only
once—in the scherzo, where for
a few measures there is rhythmic
sanity—does the mood of de-
mentia let up. The thing ad-
mittedly has vigor—as would a
gorilla with bagpipes.
On the same programme
Brahms’s First Symphony in C
Minor was given a splendid
reading. The whole work has
grace, charm and strength,
while the transition from tragic
to gay is one of the wonders of
music. Excellent work was done
by solo clarinet, hom, oboe and
violin in their various dialogues,
with all sections of full orchestra
working in fine concert and well-
controlled tone.
Hubert Evans.
In a recital given under the
auspices’ of Sydney’s Cymmro-
dorion Society, Welsh baritone
Hubert Evans revealed a voice
of fine richness in the upper
register, with a range sufficient
to do justice to the “Largo A 1
Factotum” from “The Barber of
Seville,” which he rendered with
fine artistry, though slightly
more fire would have made it
even more effective. Evans has
an especial flair for oratorio
—his “Honor and Arms,”
from “Samson,” and the
“Arm, Arm, Ye Brave,” from
“Judas Maccabaeus,” had de-
clamatory strength. A group of
Welsh ballads were sung with
plenty of spirit, and in Liza Leh-
mann’s “Myself When Young”
the singer employed a well-con-
trolled half-voice with excellent
judgment.
V * * *
Robert Pikler, Edward Cock-
man, Richard Goldner and
Theo Salzman combined to
good effect in the first reading
in Sydney of Eugene Goossens’s
String Quartet No. 2. The slow
movement has more lyrical
strength than any of Goossens’s
previous work ; the final move-
ment has a sustained vigor
which the four players pressed
home to great advantage. Some
of the best string playing the
society has presented marked
the performance of the second
“Rasoumovsky” Quartet of
Beethoven, one of the finest ex-
amples of his chamber music in
the grand manner.
Dorothy Thornhill.
Dorothy Thornhill has an ex-
hibition of her paintings, chiefly
flower-pieces, at the Macquarie
Galleries, Sydney. The smaller
pictures are the more satisfying
and typical of the artist’s talent
for fragile detail —“Azaleas,” a
small bowl with finely-touched
glistening detail in the bowl and
warm color in the flowers;
“Poet’s Medley,” blue among
pale roses, carnations and
pansies; and “Two Roses,”
another small painting with full-
blown roses ready to crumble at
a touch. In the larger paintings,
such as “Honolulu Lilies,” there
is careful craftsmanship but a
certain lack of life, as though
the artist had been painting
beautiful imitations of flowers
observed through a glass cover.
"Duet for Two Hands."
Ballarat has made theatrical
history by invading the capital
with the most extraordinary play
seen in Melbourne since “Three
Live Ghosts” at the Palace.
Mary Haley Bell’s opus con-
cerns a brilliant young musician
who damages his hands on the
cliffs of the Orkney Islands. His
friend, a brilliant experimental
surgeon, amputates the hands
and replaces them with those of
a dead man who bequeathed
them before his death for the
purpose. When the young
musician sits down at the piano
his new hands play tunes he has
never heard before but which
are immediately recognised by
the dead man’s ex-fiancee.
It then turns out that the
original owner of the hands was
hanged for murder, and it is
with very mixed feelings that the
musician now surveys his ac-
quisition. It is later revealed
that it was the brilliant surgeon
who committed the murder, the
victim being the usual girl friend
who has got into the usual
trouble.
It finally transpires that the
hanged man deliberately be-
queathed his hands in this way
in order to be revenged on the
surgeon. And the curtain comes
down with the hands drawing
the young musician towards the
throat of the guilty man, who,
however, is half-seas over with a
potent brew concocted in the
Orkney Islands, and dies of
heart-failure before he can be
strangled.
If Beerbohm Tree, Sir Henry
Irving and Laurence Olivier had
all been boiled into one actor
they couldn’t have made this
theme convincing, especially as
Miss Bell ekes out her hectic
fancy with banalities on science
and human nature which would
make a cat laugh. The Ballarat
branch of the National Theatre
Movement, which obviously has
acting talent in Marie Grace,
Gwennyth Heinz, Nancy Berry,
Peter James and Philip Hobson,
would have been well advised to
make its initial bow in the
metropolis' with something a bit
more real and simpler.

RED MILL RUM.
The £3OOO Winter Handicap, run
at Rosehill on Saturday, was the first
leg of the S.T.C.’s new £BOOO double,
which, if perpetuated, should give a
much-needed lift to the low standard
of winter racing in Sydney. It was
rather stiff luck that the club should
have struck transport trouble in the
shape of a coal-shortage ban on the
special trains which are the only
convenient way of getting to the
remotish Parramatta course.
The absence of earlier favorites
Columnist, Denali and Deep Sea left
a very open-looking field of 18 run-
ners. However, the popular pick, in
disregard of his comparatively un-
successful trip to Brisbane, was
Heroic Sovereign, backed down to
5 to 2, the next best-fancied being
Respond and The Groom, both at 11
to 2; that was nearly how they
finished. Ridden perfectly by Briscoe,
and striking all the luck of the run-
ning, the favorite ran out a clear
winner, though Respond, finishing
well for second money, was dis-
tinctly unlucky—some goat-acting as
the barrier went up had cost her
many lengths. The lightly-weighted
Persian Prince just touched The
Groom out of third money.
Trained by R. Battersby, Heroic
Sovereign (Golden Sovereign-Heroic
Belle) is worth a few words since
he is sure to be one of the early
fancies for the next Epsom, in which
he is to carry only one pound more
than the 8.8 with which he won on
Saturday. A three-year-old gelding,
he has won. at eight of his 11
starts during this season. His sire,
Golden Sovereign, tracing back to
Eclipse on the male line, and with
a dash of the Carbine blood, ran
second in the Irish Derby, but was
not a noted stayer. Most of his
progeny have shown speed, but lacked
stamina, with the exception of Summer
Cup-winner Invictus; not a brilliant
recommendation for the truly testing
Epsom mile. However, Heroic
Sovereign is from a Heroic mare
and Heroic mares have produced a
winner (Rainbird) and a runner-up
(Peter) in the Melbourne Cup as
well as winners of three Metropolitan
Handicaps, a Caulfield Cup and a
Victoria Derby. Heroic Sovereign
might well be the best of his breed.
Heroic Sovereign carried the colors
of Mrs. J. Jeffrey, and the lady
owners Completed a nice double
when Paktong (F. Walker), owned
by Mrs. G. Johnson, and trained
by her husband, won quite well from
Herbert River and New Cashmere m
the Rosehill Handicap (10f.), con-
tested by several candidates for next
Saturday’s £5OOO Winter Cup. The
placegettcrs in this, and with them
Silver Link, Spearex and Cromdes,
would all enter calculations for the
Cup should anything go amiss with
Columnist; on paper, however,
Columnist looks as near as one can
get to a handicapping certainty.
The rather riotous double of All
Spirit and Cognac, mentioned here
last week as successful at Canterbury,
surprisingly did the trick again at
Rosehill. All Spirit, ridden by
Munro, took the Two-year-old for
colts (in which third-placegetter
Khedive impressed as worth watch-
ing) and Cognac (W. Cook) won the
second Parramatta Mixed (7t.).
Cognac’s recent record of two seconds
and three wins from consecutive
starts speaks for itself. Other win-
ners at Rosehill were Alabama Queen
(E. Fordyce) beating two-year-old
fillies; Binnaway (N. Sellwood) win-
ning the first Parramatta Mixed;
Hurry Up (V. Faggotter) in the Clyde
Mixed (12f.) and Deed giving N.
Sellwood a winning double by taking
the Welter.
* * * *
After a few false farewells, Men-
tone racecourse, and with it the
V.T.R.A., were seen in action for the
last time on Saturday; both have
been “wiped” under the recent re-
organisation of racing in Victoria.
Old Sol, and the elements in general,
cast a gentle blessing upon the
obsequies, and a huge crowd turned
out.
Also probably gone into the past
with these, the Ascot Thousand. And
what better memorial to a race than
that its last running should have
gone to a favorite? Gilwell (H.
Badger), who downed Armentier and
Grand Gift in Saturday’s Thousand,
was at least equal favorite with
Greensborough, who made a poor
showing. Following on the success
of Gilwell, 7-to-2 favorite Vantage
(W. Williamson) downed the rank
outsider Blue Shadow in the 10-
furlongs Lincolnshire Handicap ; not
so palatable to punters was the suc-
cess of Tearo Silk (E. Clarke) at
10 to 1 in the Berkeley Handicap
(13L).
Curiously, the passing of a racing
track and club was marked by the
renaissance, as it were, of a good
horse of other days, when the nine-
year-old Manitoba gelding Tea Cake
(J. Gray) gamely defeated favorite
Tudor Prince in the first Knares-
borough Handicap of a mile —his first
win in a couple of years. In 1941
Tea Cake won the Caulfield Guineas,
beating a tip-top field, but, as a
gelding, wasn’t eligible for the Derby.
Skipton that year won the Derby
plus the Melbourne Cup.
The second Knaresborough went to
the only slightly fancied Lord Baden
(G. Bougoure), with Imperious and
St. Placid in the places. In other
races at Mentone, Atomic Lass
(W. A. Smith) proved too good for
a weakish bunch of two-year-olds,
and New England (T. Unkovich) beat
other three-year-olds in a finish in
which any of half a dozen horses
might have been the winner. Leading
pretty well all the way, Fairy Fable
(R. Watts) very easily won the Dela-
mere Hurdle.

jockeys’ premiership well sewn up,
but in Brisbane and Melbourne the
going is very close and next Satur-
day’s races will decide things. In
Brisbane it’s between Bruce McLean
and apprentice Noel Best; in Mel-
bourne there’s only a half-win be-
tween old rivals Badger and Purtell.

Shannon has picked up a little
more fruit for the sideboard in
America, collecting £A2300 for run-
ning third in the Sunset Handicap
at Hollywood Park, California. The
biggest prize he ever bagged for
winning in Australia was £2900 for
the Epsom. Shannon now needs
about £lO,OOO to pass Phar Lap’s
stakewinning record, and several
American races are worth twice that
amount.

Playing Cuba in the first round of
the Davis Cup competition, Australia
dropped Brown, natfiing Quist and
Sidwell for the singles and Sidwell-
Long for the doubles. In the first
singles Quist defeated Etcheverry witn
the loss of only one game, and Sid-
well beat the local champion Aguero,
6-3, 6-1, 6-4. Sidwell and Long then
won the doubles to*c!inch the tie.
The Australians in England:
Although the Ashes were safely
tucked away, the Fourth Test quickly
developed into the most thrilling
match of the tour. The English selec-
tors brought Hutton back into the
fold, and, benefited by the spell,
he figured with Washbrook in a
stand of 168 for the first wicket —
the best recorded at Leeds. Hutton
was bowled by Lindwall at 81; Wash-
brook went along quietly and surely
to 143, the second wicket going at
268. Edrich (41) and Bedser (nil)
were holding on at stumps.
Batting on doggedly on the second
day, Edrich and Bedser carried the
partnership to 155, and the total for
the third wicket to 423, Bedser mak-
ing a noble 79, and Edrich, finally,
111. The lion’s tail, unfortunately,
gave but a few feeble twitches, the
final tally being 496. Against that
total, bowling figures were not very
flattering, but ’keeper Saggers did a
grand job, allowing only two byes
and taking a couple of catches.
Australia began poorly with Morris
out for six, and, on the following
day, Pollard getting Hassett (13) and
Bradman (33) in one over. Then
Miller got going with the inspired
notion of flaying the bowling; he
went after a lively 58, and others
following his example retrieved a lost
cause, Harvey (112) added himself
to the illustrious few who have scored
a century in their first Test against
England (as he did also against
India); Loxton, belting sixers in all
directions, made 93, and at stumps on
the third day Lindwall (76) and
Toshack (12) were still there with the
score at 457 for nine wickets —a grand
recovery.

With six teams Collingwood,
Essendon, Richmond, Fitzroy, Mel-
bourne and Footscray —in reach or
the V.F.L. “four,” a tip at this stage
would make it Collingwood, Essen-
don, Fitzroy and Melbourne, with
Essendon probable minor premiers.
The Dons played a magnificent game
to down Collingwood in a grand last-
quarter burst on Saturday, going
from 10 points behind to win 16.11-
12.13, and steadily improving form
should put them on top. Fitzroy,
the early leaders, suffered their third
successive defeat, when Melbourne,
striving to make the “four,” downed
them by 17.11 to 11.11. Richmond,
21.20, had four points handed them
on a plate by St. Kilda, 5.9. Foots-
cray just managed to scramble home
against Hawthorn, 11.12-11.7.
Amongst the “also-rans,” Carlton
beat Geelong, 24.9-9.8; North Mel-
bourne beat South Melbourne, 15.14-
14.18.

Rugby Union: Comp, leaders
Randwick narrowly beat University,
16-14, in a hard game at University
Oval. University backs played well,
the Emery-Blomley combination being
particularly impressive, and Gamer,
a tricky runner and a solid defender,
scored two tries on the wing. But
the Randwick pack got most of the
ball, and backed up like internationals
—as they were, led by Shehadie and
Windon. Then international centre
Howell scored one of those tries
everyone saw coming, though nobody
could do anything to stop. Howell,
at his best, is brilliant, and it would
have probably taken two teams and-
the linesman to stop him. In other
games: Manly beat Drummoyne
11-6; St. George beat Western
Suburbs 20-14; Northern Suburbs
eclipsed Parramatta 40-8, and Gordon
beat Eastwood 16-3.
Although the older club players
may be .superior in experience, wiles
and polish, still the intensity of youth
gives its thrillingness to the weekly
Great Public Schools’ Rugby matches.
There was a corker at Cranbrook
Oval, Sydney, on Saturday when the
long - dominant St. Joseph’s struck
more than their equal in Scots Col-
lege. Scots won 16-3, though the
match was much closer than the
score suggests.

Anything remotely resembling
scientific boxing was conspicuous in
its absence from the Joe Upton (11.2)
v. Fred Braddock (11.3) contest at
Leichhardt —a pure slug-feast. First
to yield to the mutual battering was
Upton, his right eyebrow so badly
gashed in the second round that his
chief second, American Benny Evans,
who knows all there is to know
about gashed eyebrows, heaved in the
towel.

Metropolitan Cement
This flotation. Metropolitan
Portland Cement, Ltd., proposes
to manufacture cement with
Marulan limestone, Berrima coal
and local shale at a site near
Liverpool, in the Sydney metro-
politan area. The principle be-
hind the manufacturing plan is
to bring the chief raw materials
to the plant, not to take the
plant to the raw materials, as is
the case with other N. S. Wales
cement concerns. The raw
materials are a considerable
distance from Sydney by rail in
all cases, but in the past it has
been thought cheaper to freight
the finished product to the coast
than to transport the bulkier
limestone and coal to Sydney.
This is the third attempt at
the metropolitan manufacture of
cement, according to Bulletin
records, in which the name of
Arnold S. Taylor figures. Mr.
Taylor was manager of Southern
Portland Cement until 1932,
when he floated Metropolitan
Products, Ltd., with the object
of making cement at Granville
from Marulan limestone, Gran-
ville shale and coal drawn from
Camden - Bulli Collieries, in
which the new float proposed to
take a £7500 share-interest and
in which Mr. Taylor figured at
the formation. Marulan lime-
stone leases of “about 62 acres”
were sold to the cement co.,
which asked the public for
£130,000, the plant capacity to
be 50,000 tons a year. The pro-
ject never reached production.
Second appearance of Mr.
Taylor was in 1938, when Atlas
Portland Cement (Aust.), Ltd.,
was formed —A. S. Taylor
managing-director. Again the
manufacturing site was Gran-
ville ; limestone leases were to
be acquired at Marulan and on
the Macleay River, and the
Wollondilly colliery, in the
Burragorang Valley, was to be
bought. The public was asked
to put up £185,000, while Mr.
Taylor was to be given 89,500
fully-paid £1 ords. for “certain
plans, rights, processes, lease
and/or rights under mining
agreements.” Other vendor’s
agreements provided for pay-
ments totalling £29,250 in cash
and £18,500 in fully-paid shares.
The plant was to turn out 60,000
tons of cement a year; but the
project never reached that in-
teresting stage.
So much for the past, Mr.
Taylor appears in the present
flotation as a consultant who
prepared profits estimates for
the co. and as a prospective
vendor of shares in certain com-
panies interested in (a) Marulan
limestone and (b) Berrima coal.
Plant capacity is to be “about
150,000 tons” a year this time,
and it is already on order from
the Ford Motor Co., U.S.A.,
where it has apparently been
operating, but for how long is
not clear. It is expected to arrive
in Sydney in October. Dismant-
ling, shipment and landing
charges, etc., are expected to
bring the landed cost of the
plant to £437,000. Re-erection
and new buildings at Liverpool
and cost of site involve another
£140,000, equipment of the lime-
stone quarry at Marulan £95,000,
equipment of the Berrima col-
liery £25,000, brokerage £30,000,
preliminary exes. £lO,OOO, leav-
ing £63,000 for working capital
out of a proposed share issue of
£BOO,OOO in £1 ords., now on
offer to the public at par.
The prospectus, vague and
unsatisfactory in several ways,
is not sufficiently emphatic on
the point that the outlay of
£BOO,OOO does not give the
co, the freehold of the lime-
stone leases or the colliery. It
appears that Metropolitan Port-
land Cement, Ltd., has an option
over the “greater portion of the
shares in Metropolitan Cement,
Ltd., the owner of the mining
leases in respect of the limestone
areas.... .and other assets”; the
new co. has been offered an un-
specified number of shares in the
old co. for £215,713 (at the rate
of £250,000 for all the scrip),
payable in cash or shares, and in
which Arnold S. Taylor figures
as the prospective recipient of
£72,964 and Coal Holdings Pty.
of £22,770. Metropolitan Port-
land “has decided to exercise the
option #nd will complete the
purchase.” This will “avoid the
payment of royalties,” and “this
saving” and the income from
sales of limestone are expected to
“offset the dividend incidence.”
Arnold S. Taylor has also
agreed to sell the new co. his
shares in Coal Holdings Pty. for
“ Anyhow , he Wont feel THIS extraction till tomorrow
morning .”
£16,497 ; all the scrip in this co.
is to be acquired for £22,000. A
controlling interest in Loch
Catherine Colliery, Ltd., is to be
bought for £4650.
If the acquisition of these
shares involves the issue of new
capital equal to the considera-
tion payable by Metropolitan
Portland, its share register will
swell to around £1,050,000.
In estimating profits, Mr. Tay-
lor, “for reasons of policy,” de-
clines to furnish “detail costs.”
He displayed a similar reluctance
in the Atlas case in 1938, details
then being withheld “for obvi-
ous reasons.”
But total costs per ton (ex-
cluding taxes) are now put by
Mr. Taylor at about £3 155., and,
with cement sales at £5 Bs. and
output at the full capacity of
150.000 tons a year, a gross
profit of £248,750 is forecast,
with “net” at £161,750, after
deducting taxes. Presumably
estimates would be increased
slightly by the acquisition of
shares in the limestone co., but
the profits would have to be
spread over a considerably
bigger capital.
Thanks largely to the unusual
kindness of the Canberra Gov-
ernment, Mr. Taylor is now
likely to see his plan for metro-
politan cement production—
whatever the cost or profit per
ton —come true. “The import-
ance attached to the industry by
the Commonwealth Govern-
ment,” says the prospectus, “is
shown by the allocation to the
company of $1,189,110 for the
purchase of a complete plant
from the Ford Company of
U.S.A., despite the grave defic-
iency of dollars.” But whether
“the works will be fully operat-
ing in 1949,” as forecast, and
whether anything like £161,750
“net” can be earned by the co. in
a year on either a paid capital of
£BOO,OOO or upon £1,050,000 is
a matter for deep consideration
by the investment market. The
“arrangements made for freight
rates” will have an acute bearing
on profit-earning.
Kandos Cement, whose half-
share in plant capacity in N. S.
Wales and Victoria is consider-
ably greater than that proposed
by Metropolitan, has a paid
capital of only £673,862. Its
share of earnings in the operat-
ing subsidiary is not revealed,
but Kandos pays 10 p.c. divs. Its
16s. shares are at 455. in the
market. There is currently a
shortage of cement in most parts
of the Commonwealth, estimated
in N. S. Wales to be as much as
100.000 tons a year, arising
mostly from coal, labor and
transport problems. But existing
plant has not been fully work-
ing ; Southern Portland has been
manufacturing on behalf of the
Standard company for several
years, but Standard, with a plant
capacity of 100,000 tons a year,
should recommence production
later in 1948.
Directors of Metropolitan
Portland Cement are J. T. Wal-
ton, Arthur Vickery, L. J. Hart-
nett, A. T. George, R. G. Hamil-
ton, M.L.A., and E. R. Griffin.
Brokers are C. H. Smith and Co.
The Sharemarket •
Australian sharemarkets
weakened in sympathy with the
drop in Wall-street prices last
week. Our market invariably
goes through these motions
whenever Wall-street appears
distressed without ever revealing
a good and sufficient reason.
Actually the Australian scene
presented some disconcerting
features last week from the
short-term aspect: the coal and
shipping position was not one
to inspire anyone with enthusi-
asm, especially when Senator
Ashley was heard blaming
Lysaghts for a shortage of zinc
that was threatening the pro-
duction of galvanised iroii and
wire and N. S. Wales Minister
Baddeley protested that there
were no coal strikes in progress,
only stoppages.
Perhaps an even more acute
industrial breakdown than those
we have seen to date will be
experienced by the community
before sanity returns to industry.
The Communists are still bent
on reducing Australian produc-
tive activity to a minimum, and
mere words from Mr. Chifley
asking for increased production
will bring no relief to the situ-
ation. There must be a show-
down with the Communists, but
whether this will come before
the Canberra Socialists are
tossed out of office is a question
still to be decided.
In the meantime it is this Com-
munist and politico-industrial
problem that is standing in the
way of great activity and pro-
duction by Australian industry,
and the Socialist Government at
Canberra is one of the chief
promoters of the increasing in-
flation in costs and money-values
now so evident. The production
deficiency partly arises from the
transfer of employment-giving
responsibility from private enter-
prise to the Government. Heavy
taxes, too, are to be laid at the
door of the Socialists —these
taxes are almost wanton.
But with socialist intent re-
moved from the seat of Gov-
ernment, with taxes down and
with the principle of a fair day’s
work for fair pay generally
observed—This simple equation
represents the answer to most of
our problems—a vast indus-
trial prospect opens before Aus-
tralia, a country that has appeal
for people in all lands provided
it is governed wisely and with
full regard for economic conse-
quences.
The basic value of Australian
industrial shares remains un-
altered by the fluctuations on
Wall-street. Our problems are
largely those in front of us,
barring the matter of export
prices and import costs. Few
industrial shares today are
valued on the basis of present
wool and wheat prices.

G.H.Q. COURIER
Pianos, White Mice or Roast Chicken-
All by Air
By JOHN MACGOWAN
During the advance on
Wewak a soldier who in civilian
life had been the editor of a
Sydney weekly was trudging
along the old German road with
full gear after disembarking at
Hawain River. He saw some-
thing drop from a low-flying
plane and propped in his tracks.
A bundle missed his head by a
couple of feet and burst open
behind him, scattering its con-
tents—two dozen copies of his
own paper. The plane which
nearly brained the editor be-
longed to the G.H.Q. courier
service, which, if not always as
efficient in choosing its “tar-
gets,” always managed to drop
its cases and bundles where they
were most appreciated.
The G.H.Q. courier was
established in 1943, after a phone
talk between General Mac-
Arthur and Mr, Curtin, to pro-
vide a service between the
general’s Brisbane H.Q. and
forward areas. The American
322nd Troop-Carrier Wing pro-
vided the aircraft and Australian
civil airlines supplied mainten-
ance facilities and staff. Cap-
tains J;or the aircraft were drawn
from civil airlines, co-pilots and
radio - operators from the
R.A.A.F.
The combination succeeded
immediately, and in years,
with a trip every night between
mainland and the islands, the
courier failed only twice to de-
liver the general’s mail on time.
On both occasions the aircraft
crashed, killing the crews.
The courier began in Sep-
tember, 1943, leaving Bris-
bane at 8 p.m. each night
and arriving at Moresby at
5 a.m. next morning. As the
Allies advanced the courier
pushed on, first to Nadzab and
Finschhafen, then to Hob
landia. Then it followed
General MacArthur’s men in
their island-hopping campaign,
from Biak to Morotai. Finally
the courier reached the Philip-
pines, still originating its flights
in Brisbane though the general
and his staff had moved north.
The sight of an American C 47
transport with Australian civil
airline markings alongside the
familiar star confused troops on
airstrips at forward areas, and
when they saw Australian Air
Force crew pile out the back-
door they were worse con-
founded. The R.A.A.F. lads
were not above capitalising
this. Some of them wore strange
conglomerations of civilian,
U.S., A.I.F. and R.A.A.F.
clothes. When tackled by a
R.A.A.F. officer they generally
replied “Oh, you’d better see
the Yanks; we’re responsible
to them.” If that failed they
would plead their solemn obli-
gation to take instructions from
no one but the civil airlines.
When the courier started a
subsidiary service was run to
Adelaide. Arriving back at
Brisbane from Adelaide one
afternoon a co-pilot found him-
self rostered to leave the same
evening for Port Moresby. At
Moresby he handed to a sur-
prised S.A. soldier the previous
day’s paper from Adelaide.
Hearing of the incident most
Australian dailies offered to
provide papers for Allied troops
in forward areas if the courier
would take them. Airline com-
panies brought the Adelaide,
Melbourne and Sydney dailies to
Brisbane each day by their civil
passenger network. The courier
left at 8 p.m. and, after re-
fuelling at Townsville, arrived
at Finschhafen at 5 a.m. next
day—Port Moresby was dropped
from the courier route at this
stage of the war. Crews were
changed at Finschhafen and the
aircraft left for Hollandia, pas-
sing over troops fighting in the
Wewak area around 11 a.m.
Camps vied with each other
to attract attention—and a
bundle of newspapers. Artillery
was often silenced while the
courier flew in and dropped its
load. One unit erected a huge
sign facing skywards, “Thanks
for the papers.” Their courtesy
was rewarded by a full case of
ice-cream packed in dry-ice and
provided free by an Australian
confectioner.
General MacArthur’s mail
did not occupy the whole plane,
and the manifest often listed
some strange cargoes. On one
trip 20 cages of white mice were
carted to Manila for Army
medical research. During a
storm the cage-doors flew open
and the mice escaped. Several
of them made three return trips
from Brisbane to Manila before
succumbing to the cold. When
the general moved to Hollandia
the courier took his furniture,
and the men on the strip were
startled to see a piano rolled out
the back-door of the aircraft.
Crews, of course, managed to
carry a wonderful variety of
private parcels to and from New
Guinea for soldiers and relatives
in Brisbane. One radio-operator-
collected a sponge-cake hot
from the oven at 3 p.m. each
Friday from a soldier’s wife in
Brisbane and delivered it with an
accompanying letter at Finsch-
hafen at six next morning. At
that time letters were normally
taking six weeks to reach troops
in Finschhafen.
Only tinned food was pro-
vided for troops at Finsch.
at this time, and one enterpris-
ing cook persuaded a courier
pilot to bring cases of roast
chickens, fresh vegetables and
fruit each trip. The birds were
killed and roasted just before
take-oQ in Brisbane. The C.O.
was always invited to dinner.
Courier crews often left Bris-
bane on a cold winter night and
landed in New Guinea in boil-
ing sun next day. After resting,
the same crew would fly as high
as 22,000 ft. over New Guinea’s
snow-capped mountains, de-
scending once more to the
tropical heat at Hollandia.
Night-flying was another drag.
Usually the pilot, co-pilot and
radio-operator took turns: at the
controls, but on one occasion
they all went to sleep. The air-
craft had left Townsville at
1 a.m. flying due north for New
Guinea. When the pilot woke at
3 a.m. the compass showed that
he was flying due south back to
Townsville. On another flight
the courier was returning to
Brisbane with a full load of
Americans and Australians on
leave. It was hot, and the crews
dozed off. The aircraft dropped
lower and lower,, Suddenly the
passengers were alarmed by the
blast of the safety-horn designed
to warn pilots landing that the
wheels were not down. No one
ever woke so quickly as that
pilot.
Most radio-operators tuned in
to short-wave broadcasts, and
one who could not provide a
good swing session was in bad
odor. It was a common prac-
tice, too, for crews to listen to
the mainland race-broadcasts
even while flying over Jap posi-
tions, the captain acting as
bookmaker for the rest of the
crew.
As the courier plied regularly
between New Guinea and the
mainland, many troops tried to
sneak a trip down to Brisbane
for a day ot two. Eventually
one captain agreed to take a
homesick youngster from
Finschhafen to Brisbane for a
week-end. He reached Brisbane
safely, but that night the route
of the courier was changed and
the luckless soldier had. no
option but to give himself up to
the M.Ps.
The courier kept going long
after the war, and one of its
most pleasant tasks was bringing
home war-weary troops for the
last time,


ABORIGINALITIES
“Curtain Raiser”; Meteors and other
heavenly visitations falling on Rome por-
tended the death of Julius Caesar, accord-
ing to Plutarch, but there is no historical
evidence that cities have ever been the
target for a full-sized specimen, though
millions fall on this earth annually. Just
as well, perhaps. Dr. Frank Reeves and
N. B. Sauve, geologists with an oil-com-
pany survey, recently discovered a crater
made by a giant meteorite where the
Kimberleys converge on the flat, arid
Simpson Desert, 400 miles inland from
Broome and 64 miles from Hall’s Creek.
It is half a mile wide at the bottom, 150 ft.
deep and has a lip which rises above
the surrounding desert 100 ft. It is
obviously the grave of the meteorite
which R. Way, postmaster and meteoro-
logical observer at Hall’s Creek, saw as
an immense ball of fire which passed over
the settlement and fell with an explosion
that shook the earth in December, 1906.
Accurately aimed at Melbourne, it would
have done more effective damage than
the atomic bomb did to Hiroshima.
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: Those who see only the
lowlands of New Guinea have no idea
of the sort of country that lies above the
clouds. For days you toil upwards
through the rain forest, in a perpetual
lather of sweat; then the nights become
colder and you need the blanket you’d
cursed lower down. Above the rain
forest lies the gloomiest-looking vegeta-
tion on earth; the dank and dripping
moss forest, festooned with long
whiskers ; but above this again you enter
a region where it is bitterly cold at night.
Here the vegetation changes completely,
being mainly pines with even a real oak,
complete with acorns. Higher still lies
a country of rolling hills and grassy
plains, dotted with magnificent stands of
a pine very similar to the Queensland
bunya, with clear streams of water every
mile or so. Men in our section who had
worked in the timber-mills used to look
at those pines and estimate what they
would fetch if there was some way of
getting the huge logs to the Brisbane
wharves; the lads from the cattle and
sheep country would visualise the stock
which the country would carry, while
those from the farming areas agreed that
the soil should grow any kind of crop.
A glance over the stockade-like fences
of the native gardens seemed to bear this
out. Zebu cattle could graze on those
vast areas of grass; air transport of
quick-frozen beef would help to feed
meat-hungry Britain. There would be no
shortage of native labor. As for the power
to run a meatworks and its refrigerating
plant—well, I saw one waterfall alone
which a Dutch engineer said would
furnish enough hydro-electric power to
light hjs native Rotterdam, But, of
course, there are Eddie Ward and his
“planning” to reckon with.
* * * *
“Betcha”: In settled country the young
and foolish foxes don’t present much of
a problem, but many an old Johnny
avoids capture by using his nut. Saw one
knock up a first-class greyhound by tak-
ing advantage of nothing but a wire
fence. Calmly slipping under the wires,
he would wait till the big hound jumped
over, then he’d slip back and wait for a
repeat performance. An old fox is wary
of poison, suspicious of a trap and has
learned the art of dodging. With a couple
of mongs on his brush, a favorite resort
is a patch of fern. Dashing in, he waits
till the hounds have hurtled round the
edge to the far side, anticipating his re T
appearance there ; then he hastily doubles
on his track from his point of entry. Bent
on lamb for dinner, a fox is often frus-
trated by the defence of the ewe, but the
couple of ginger blokes I came on the
other day had solved the problem. Hunt-
ing together, they approached the pros-
pective meal from opposite sides, then,
while one held the attentions of the ewe,
gradually drawing her further away, the
other watched his chance to dash in for
the lamb.

“K”: G.-G. McKell, in Cairns in the
course of showing his vice-regal coun-
tenance around Australia, went to sea in
a motor-launch to watch a whale that
had appeared. No story followed from
the Queensland town, but when McKell
passed on to Darwin and got among the
local Ripleys the story telegraphed south
was that the whale was 60ft. long, that
McKell was taken to “within 10ft. of it,”
and then “it reared high out of the water,
towering over the boat.” He lived to tell
the tale because “the launch made all pos-
sible speed in reverse.” Darwin’s efforts
to persuade him to try his luck at tickling
an alligator out in a back creek were un-
availing.

“Billy See”: Anyone handy with a
pocket-knife could make a slotted kip or
lannet (B. 16/6/’4B), but it required a
deft hand to manufacture tfre double-
headed penny. Filing or grinding the tail
face of the two pennies was a tedious
job, since coin bronze offers high resist-
ance to such abrasion. The filing, too,
needed to be done with the utmost accu-
racy ; there must be no silver streak be-
traying the solder of the join. The best
and quickest way was to catch the penny
in the chuck of a small lathe, and turn
the surplus metal off. In this way two
absolutely accurate halves were obtained.
Joining came next, and wasn’t to be done
clumsily with a soldering-iron. The two
heads, their underfaces bright and clean,
were treated with soldering fluid ; then
laid together with the thinnest of tinfoil
between. Placed on a shovel over a hot
fire the foil soon melted, sweating the
two heads firmly together. When done
by a tradesman the join couldn’t be de-
tected without a magnifying-glass. Have
seen men convinced that the double-
header was really a mishap at the Mint.
* * * *
“Old Camp”: If, as “S. Gums” says (B.
16/6/’4B), Kendenup (W.A.) yielded rich
ore “as early as the late ’sixties,” the
finders of that time must have kept re-
markably silent, for there is no mention
of such a discovery in any official his-
tory. More, they must have been
markedly deficient in the spirit of acqui-
sition, for at that time a reward of £5OOO
to any free person discovering a payable
deposit of gold was on offer, made by
Governor Hampton. This should also
have encouraged “S.G.’s” ancient convict
to have opened up a bit, since the offer,
although not made to transported mem-
bers of W.A. society, did hold out some-
thing—any convict reporting a payable
find would receive a free pardon, accom-
panied by such money reward as the Gov-
ernor should deem fitting. So anxious
was Governor Hampton to have the bene-
fits of gold production brought to be-
nighted W.A. that in 1863 he engaged the
celebrated Hargraves to come West and
make an examination of the country,
After a scamper around the well-watered,
umbrageous south-west Hargraves gave
the opinion that gold would not be found
in Westralia. True, as “S.G.” says, specks
“The winner—on a technical k. o.!”
have been picked up in lots of places. It
was the finding of a big speck by Glass,
of Mugakine, in 1887 that started the
prospecting which eventually uncovered
the Yilgam, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, etc.

“Zake”: Resolve me, now, you experts
on equine physics—on what part of the
horse is put the greatest strain when it is
pulling a heavy load: fore or aft? I
plump for the forelegs as Captain bends
into the collar, but I’m open to correc-
tion.
* * * #
“Lower Tops’!”: Give me Tassie’s well-
indented coastline for picturesque place-
names, Starting down south at Recherche,
you have Cockle Creek Township and
Catamaran Bay ; then Fluted Cape—that
bold headland on Bruny Island whose
rock formations resemble fluted columns
—Quiet Cove Beach and Adventure Bay
near by; then come Eaglehawk Neck,
Pirates Bay, the Cock’s Comb —a moun-
tain ridge on Maria Island —Wineglass
Bay, the Bay of Fires, Tommyhawk Bay,
Stockyard Cove and Chimney Corner.
And where could you beat the Ballroom
for a mighty forest and Peasoup Creek
for a roaring yellow torrent on the wet
west coast?.

“Solitude”: Seventyfiver skinned the
length of eel he had brought in and
dropped it into the hot fat in the camp-
oven. There it squirmed, twisted, and
presently shot out into the fire. With a
curse the old bloke retrieved it, knocked
off some of the charcoal and pushed it
back into the fat. Then, his hat and
dinner-fork held ready for battle, he stood
over it warily for a few minutes, but as
the prospective tucker threatened no
further violence he went off for another
bit of firewood. There was none handy,
and when eventually he returned his feed
had disappeared. Carefully he raked out
the ashes, searched the floor and shifted
the heap of broken dingo-traps before re-
signing himself complainingly to a heavy
. slab of toast. Bet old Blue was surprised
at the nature and sudden arrival of his
tea that night, though Seventyfiver has
not yet discovered that the latest scar on
the old warrior’s nose is a scorch-mark.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Though
I was Gippsland-reared and have spent
winters in stormy Bass Strait islands, I
have never suffered colder nights than
when on the track from Marble Bar to
Nullagine (W.A.). Most of the dark hours
werp spent by the fire. But the wood and
quick-flaring spinifex fires of n.-w.
Westralia are missing on the bleak, tree-
less and cheerless downs in nor’-west
Queensland. There on odd winter even-
ings when the sou’-west trade dropped
away, temperatures froze, and with in-
nocuous cow-dung smokes, the whole
camp would finish up shivering the night
through, draped in blankets and swag-
covers, and route-marching—simply to
keep alive.
* * * *
“Blime”: When Andy was allotted a
block near old Charlie he stocked it with
a draft of jumbucks from a mob Charlie
had bought. Chas. didn’t want the lot,
so, running them through the race, he
turned the woollies one each way till
Andy’s quota was reached. Lambing-
time arrived, and, spotting the newchum
tending his ewes, Charlie went over to
see how things were going. “Want to
keep your eye on those eagles,” he ad-
vised, watching a pair of the big
scavengers circling low. “You might get
a shot sometime,” “Shoot a wedgetail!”
Andy’s voice was horrified. “Gripes,
don’t tell me you believe that yarn about
wedgies taking lambs? Why, it’s nothing
but malicious slander.” A couple of
weeks later Andy again mentioned the
eagles. “They live in the paddock all the
time now,” he told the older man. “But
they don’t take lambs—just clean up
anything dead. I’ve seen the bones and
skin about.” “If you’ve finished lambing,”
said Charlie, ignoring the eagle question,
“we might’s well give each other a hand
with marking.” Next day, his lambs
finished, Charlie counted the tails.
“Hundred and one per cent.,” he an-
nounced. “Righto, well go’n do yours.”
They did, and soon it came the new-
chum’s turn to check his increase. “It’s
—er —sixty-one per cent,” he said. “Now,
that’s funny. They all seemed to have
lambs, and they’ve been doing well. I
wonder Gripes, yes, that’s it; there
must be a blasted fox taking them! ”
* * * *
“Bughouse”: That wasn’t a bad yarn
of “Goldie’s” (B. 16/6/’4B) about the in-
dicator needle of the pressure-gauge on
the air-tank going around the second
time like the dial on the butcher’s scales.
But that needle just couldn’t. A pressure-
gauge, steam or compressed-air, works on
the same principle that makes the
garden hose lying curled on the lawn try
to straighten out when the tap is turned
on. Inside a pressure-gauge is a short
length of flattened, flexible copper tube
with a semicircular turn, the larger
bottom end being connected with the
source of pressure, the upper end taper-
ing not quite to a point. To this upper
sealed end is attached a hinge, which
connects with one end of a rack of fine
cog-teeth, which is in contact with a
clock-wheel, fixed on the same centre-
spindle as the indicator-needle. Thus as
pressure increases in the tube it more and
more tends to straighten: which draws
the toothed rack across the toothed wheel,
which turns the spindle that carries the
indicator-needle around the dial. One of
those simple things the invention of
which was a stroke of genius. The in-
dicator needle’s travel is thus limited by
the length of the rack. Actually I have
never seen a pressure-gauge on which the
needle could describe even a single circle,
* * * *
“Kelms”: If, as “Colonial Cove”
claims (B. 30/6/’4B), Guildford grass was
introduced into W.A, from Java, a grave
injustice has been done to the memory of
a fine old pioneer. My father, who knew
and respected the old chap, deplored that
his name was likely to be perpetuated in
a pest rather than in his considerable
achievements, and he and others were
genuinely pleased when the name Pad-
bury grass was replaced by the now uni-
versally accepted Guildford grass. All
the old-timers to whom I ever spoke on
the subject blamed the elder Padbury
for the weed, while admitting that he
acted in good faith. I’ll accept “C.C.’s”
explanation if he can solve one prob-
lem, The bulb is of European origin:
how was it introduced into Java, and for
what purpose?
* * * *
“Bardie”; The .rain was teeming out-
side the hut at Haunted Creek, and the
wind howled and whispered against the
slabs and shingles. The apparition seated
next to me at the waning fire was the
ghost of the bloke who, as storytellers
constantly remind us, calmly lifts a glow-
ing coal from the fire between gnarled
thumb and forefinger and unhurriedly
ignites his pipe. I was about to ask him
where he learned the trick when a spark
sailed out towards him and he plucked
at it with his asbestos digits. Something
must have disturbed his spooky equa-
nimity, for he at once let out a rever-
berating croak, and vanished with a mild
explosion through the wall.
THE BROWN MEN.
I have little use for the town men
With their faces pink and white,
But I dream by day and night
Of the bronzed men, the brown men,
The men of my heart’s delight..-.
Of a busier life and a bolder,
Of a life that is clean and hard
In the bush and the breaking-yard;
Of brown arms bare to the shoulder
And brown hands rough and scarred.
The last miles loom before me
And swiftly the short hours pass;
The shadows lie on the grass
Of the dark wings hovering o’er me,
The sand runs down in the glass.
But the youth in my heart retraces
The tracks of the old bushland
Where we rode in a laughing band,
And I long for the sun-frowned faces
And the grip of a rough brown hand.
SCOTLAND.

“Bo”; Any suggestion that Mitchell
is a man steeped in extravagant habits
may perhaps be refuted by the following
incident. Mitchell had borrowed
Hansen’s dray to bring sand up from the
creek for concreting his cowbail floor.
When he returned it a few days later his
approach to the Hansen homestead was
presaged by agonised squeals from the
wheel-hubs. Hansen opined that the least
he could have done was to have put some
axle-grease on them before returning the
vehicle. Mitchell offered to do it right
there if Hansen would supply the axle-
grease—he said he didn’t have any at his
place. “But, dammit! ” Hansen exploded.
“You could have put some kitchen fat
on, couldn’t you?” Mitchell looked
aggrieved. “Square up, Tom,” he said.
“I’m gettin’ fifteen-bob a kerosene-tin
for that!”

“Mat’s Mate”: In Coonabarabran we
heard of a job out Tooraweenah way and
headed for it. When we came to the place
we saw a bloke, a small girl and three
dogs dipping sheep, but when we got
closer the bloke turned out to be a young
woman wearing pants. “You men look-
ing for work?” she asked, blowing a lock
of hair out of her eyes. I waited for Mat,
knowing him. Mat looked at her and
then said: “Well, we was. But we don’t
work on no place where the missus wears
the pants.” She dropped the dip blind,
spoke to the child, then faced Mat, “My
husband’s in hospital with a broken leg,”
she said. “He wears the pants, when he
can. My place is in the house and I don’t
need you to tell me that. But somebody
has to dip the sheep.” Mat gave her a
level look. “All right,” he said. “Me an’
me mat© can do the dippin’; if you ain’t
kiddin’ you go an’ do the cookin’.” Her
smile was so full of relief that she couldn’t
speak. She made for the house. Mat
took off his coat. “There’s some wimmen
a man can work for,” he grunted. “Hop
into that pen,' mate.”
♦ * * *
“B. A. Ker”: The fellow with the
wobble in his walk was obviously looking
for trouble. His voice, as powerful as his
frame appeared to be, and thicker than
his neck, proclaimed: “I’m One-two
Grady ; I can flatten any one man over
twelve stone and any two under.” No
local pug stepped forward to subdue the
stranger—reputations travel far in the
bush, and the name of One-two Grady
had been plastered on hoardings outside
scores of small-time stadiums. Up and
down in front of the saleyards the bel-
ligerent tacked, emitting his challenge at
regular intervals. On the third voyage
a likely-looking young man climbed down
from the top rail, stopped him with a
large hand placed squarely on the chest,
and asked: “So you reckon you’re
One-two Grady? Well, I think I can
flatten you.” The fight was a shocking
affair —just three punches were thrown
before .a one-two rocked the alleged
One-two Grady to sleep. Later the victor
confided to me lugubriously: “The
trouble is a man doesn’t know what to
do for the best. If I’d let him go on,
what would have happened? People
would have gone away saying that One-
two Grady is just a booze-fighter. But
now I’ve cleaned him up it wifi get about
that some street-fighter stopped One-two
Grady in a couple of punches. And I’m
One-two Grady!” I tried to sound sym-
pathetic, but it didn’t sound very sincere.
If he was One-two Grady he, must have
changed considerably in three months—
I hadn’t seen my sister’s husband for that
length of Time.

“H.A.L.”: The sulphur-crested cocka-
too has an even wider distribution than
that given by “Horseless Horseman” (B.
7/7/’4B). He’s also found all through
New Guinea, though chiefly on the high-
lands. Every native village has pet ones
waddling about; they are sorry-looking
specimens, though, for their wing and
tail feathers are pulled out as fast as
they grow, to be used for ornaments,
while their yellow crests,suffer the same
way. But out in the. forest they are
just as handsome as they are here, and
we owe them a debt, for the bushmen
“Every man to his trade —you should consult a plumber."
among our troops soon tumbled to the
fact that by watching them in the tree-
tops you could tell when the Jap was on
the move in the daytime—something
which never seemed to occur to the stupid
Nip. Incidentally, the old sulphur-
crest doesn’t make a bad feed if you can
get a young one, although he’s darned
hard to shoot. And it’s no good trying
to pot the sentry bird —he was probably
middle-aged back in Macquarie’s day.
But if you scatter wheat or maize on the
clearings where they come to dig up
edible bulbs and set a few rabbit-traps
with rag-wrapped jaws you can usually
bag the sort needed for the pot,

“C.E.”: Hearing that old Fincher
wanted a couple of men for stock work,
Billy and Rod decided to look into the
matter. “Work sounds easy enough,”
Billy agreed, “But y’ never know with
that bloke. Tell y’ what. You sound
him out about the screw an’ things and
if it’s all right I’ll follow y’ t’morrer,”
Rod agreed, called on Fincher, and, other
things being satisfactory, mentioned
wages. “Five quid,” the owner replied.
“Always pay five quid. Got your own
horse?” Rod shook his head. “Righto,
I’ll find you one,” the boss agreed,
“ ’Course, you understand I’ll have to
knock a quid off your wages for supply-
ing it.” Rod reported back to Billy, and
the following day found Bill seeking
Fincher. “That’s right, I need another
man,” Fincher answered, going on to ex-
plain things. “Then there’s the wages,”
he continued. “I pay five quid. Now,
what about a horse?” Bill hastily pointed
out that he had a good nag. “Aw, you
want to bring y’r own, eh?” frowned
Fincher. “Well, that’s different, o’ course.
Not that I mind you having him, but, you
see. I’ll have to knock a quid off y’r
wages if I got to keep y’r nag, too.”

“Lower Tops’l”: Mention of fertile
Green Island, in Bass Strait (B. 16/6/’4B),
recalls that it was first settled by two
pioneering women in 1869 —the widow
and adopted daughter of Captain Davis,
a former master-mariner and superin-
tendent of rockbound Goose Island light-
house, 12 miles away. A log hut, sheep-
yards and sheds were built and, in later
years, a homestead. Those two women
led a somewhat different life from their
present-day sisters farming in the
Straits 80 years ago with no menfolk to
help, practically no communication and
where snake-hunting was the order of the
day. Killings averaged 1000 a year to
begin with!
* * ♦ *
“Bosun’s Mate”; Tell “Lower Tops’l”
that “those charts made by the R.A.N.
of the New Guinea area” (B. 21/7/’4B)
are not Admiralty charts, but Australian,
and particularised as such by the prefix
“Aus.” before each chart number. Am
aware that our maps are colored —have
discolored ’em often enough but
Admiralty’s have only recently been
brightened. Since April, 1941, when the
Australian chart of Port Moresby was
first published (Admiralty chart of the
area previously in use was printed in
1852), the hydrographic branch in
Sydney, with its own cartographic depart-
ment, has prepared for printing its own
charts, surveyed by Australian ships. A
Sydney firnf which also stencils tobacco-
pouches does the printing. It is hoped
entirely to supplant Admiralty charts of
Australian waters, some hundreds of
years old, with our own modern surveys ;
and to supersede Admiralty with Aus-
tralian atlases, sailing directions, nautical
almanacs and tide-tables.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: A Westralian out-
back town is doing itself proud to the
tune of a brand-new £36,000 post-office,
and some of the builders are seeing life
in the raw apparently for the first time.
One chap took the count to the local
grasshoppers. They’re big and hardy,
but the district hadn’t taken them really
seriously until this fellow landed in hos-
pital. Don’t say they mobbed him? I
wasn’t going to. He ate them —reckoned
they were the best prawns he’d ever
tasted.
* * * *
“Hanko”: The sound of a motor-bike’s
snorting approach on the usually traffic-
free unfenced road surprised us, and
hastily we began to hustle the mob to
one side. But a wool-blind old ewe
propped and skittered back on the track,
taking, with her a score or so of her stupid
sisters. There was only one thing for the
speeding cyclist to do, and he did it in-
stanter. Swerving off the track he went
bouncing among the bordering trees,
sending rearward a spray of leaves, bark
and twigs. Rejoining the road a furlong
on,, without a backward glance, he went
puttering away in a cloud of dust. We
were both shaken ; even the kelpie’s
forelegs trembled. The boss brushed a
hand that shook a mite across his brow.
“One thing about sheep,” he said. “No
matter what happens they never turn a
hair.”
# * * *
“E. 2”: The Rawson brothers, Bob
and Sam, had taken a dairyfarm on
shares. When I called there Bob was
flat-out with the milking on his own.
“Where’s Sam?” I asked. “Lyin’ down
on his bunk,” Bob said. “Crook?” “Not
him.” “But I thought you were partners
in this share-farmin’.” “Yair.” Bob
stopped stripping a cow long enough for
a wistful look down the valley. “I do the
farmin’ an’ he does the sharin’,” he said.
* * * *
“Esk D.”; The traveller knocks at the
door of the new house on the rise and
strikes his most captivating pose as the
young woman opens it, “I’m from
the” 'he begins, “Sssh,” replies the
woman, a finger to her lips. “I feel sure
you’d be interested in” he tries again.
“Sssh,” cautions the woman, an ominous
look in her eyes. The traveller clears his
throat a shade nervously. “You’ll pardon
me” he pleads. But before she has
time to “sssh” a male hand clamps on his
arm and scoots him down to the gate.
“Now, get to hell out of this with your
clatter an’ let the baby sleep,” he is
warned grimly by the husband. The
traveller makes his way off thoughtfully.
Two hours later he is back, ready to dish-
out baby admiration and mothercraft
hints fit to mollify any proud parent. His
fountain-pen again proves useful for
signing a cheque and contract to buy an
electric home-lighting set.
* * * ♦
“GToper”: Stone walls around a farm
may look picturesque, but they are
costly. Not so much in the labor of
building, since the stone is usually close
handy, but in the arable land they per-
manently occupy. Take a small farm of
640 acres, one square mile —four miles
of fence. And any stone wall to be at
all substantial requires at least an 18in.
base. How many rows of corn could be
sown along that strip? How much grass
may be smothered under such a wall?
One can realise when noting how stock
graze right under a wire-fence. A better
way to dispose of the stone is to use it
for buildings. Have seen W.A. farms
where every building, dwelling-house and
shed was of stone gathered off the land.
And where there had still been a surplus
after building it had been used to cobble-
over yards which otherwise would have
been quagmires in winter. Others, again,
I have seen pile the stone into bastions
in the corners of the paddock, holding
that it occupied much less land piled thus
than when built into a fence.
* * * *
“Trade Wind”; New Guinea’s strangest
cult is Vailala, or Cargo Cult. Up the
Fly River the natives periodically suffer
fits of frustration. Up jumps a prophet.
He had a dream. In it the spirits of his
ancestors told him they had been send-
ing the village goods (cargo) from kai-
kai to houses and lap-laps. But the
white man had grabbed thecft. Throw
off your black skins, the spirits told him,
they are only singlets; you are white
underneath, With the village in a frenzy,
wharves are bujlt to receive the spirits’
gifts of ships, huge sheds to store kai-kai,
and all available village food is gorged
in a week of feasting. If the patrol
officers get there in time, as they usually
do, it stops at that and an exhausted
village goes back to hunting and fishing.
Once, however, the maddened mob
hacked off a planter’s head.
AT THE WINDLASS.
Winding-up the windlass,
Bucket on the rope,
Full of quartz for crushing,
Full of faith and hope;
Letting it down empty,
Down the shaft below
Where the lighted lantern
Dimly casts a glow.
Faint the pick is ringing,
Clink of quartz on steel,
Faint the shovel weighing
What the shades conceal;
Winding-up the windlass,
Round and round and round,
Rope now taut and pulling,
Straining to the sound.
Cloud above is sailing,
All the world is still,
Come the parrots calling,
Crimson on the hill;
Hot the sun is shining,
Shimmering the heat,
Little pool of shadow
Lying at the feet.
Round and round the arm goes,
Broken seems the back,
Windlass old is creaking,
Timbers dry and crack.
Winding-up the windlass,
Gazing at the skies,
Up and down the bucket...
Oh, the flaming flies!
VICTORIA.

THE WAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Flock-improvement.
“K.W.R.”; No matter how
high the standard of the *fewes,
their progeny must degenerate if
inferior rams are used.
Most progressive breeders
aim at an ideal type which
grows more and better wool on
bigger frames. The popular
flock ram at present is medium-
woolled, plain-bodied and free
from breech wrinkles, while
possessing those characteristics
of conformation and type uni-
formity which mark a good sire.
Rams which as two-tooths or
even four-tooths meet all these
requirements may later fall
away, which is why the sheep-
man should go through them
each year before they are mated
and cull out any that don’t
make the grade. Good rams
may be dear, but the extra
guineas paid—apart from being
an allowable taxation deduction
—will be offset manyfold by in-
creased return per head from
progeny in later years.
The need for consistent and
regular culling’ of ewes cannot
be overemphasised. In most
cases they should not be classed
until they are 18 months to two
years of age. Seasonal condi-
tions and transition from lamb
to weaner stage affect sheep in
such varying degrees that clas-
sing in the weaner year, or even
a little later, does not do justice
to the sheep.
Sheep should be classed as
they go through the shed for
shearing, or a short time before
if yards are free from dust and
manpower is available. At
shearing it is a simple matter
to raddle the culls and draft
them off.
Sheep Prices.
“J.S.L.”: In reply to “R.
Ney” (B. 19/5/’48), I have
bought and sold many sheep,
and have come to the conclusion
that the average seller doesn’t
play any tricks because he wants
the buyer to come back again.
The average buyer wants to
know where he can place a good
line, so he doesn’t play any
tricks. Actually the tricksters
are poor judges, whether buyers
or sellers.
My advice to anyone wanting
to stock up with breeders is to
buy young ewes, in lamb if pos-
sible, bred on country inferior
to his own. About 70 per cent,
of breeding goes down the
animal’s neck, so breeders
brought from inferior country
to superior country will usually
turn out a reasonably good
deal,

fme-breeding should not be
attempted with anything but
the highest-quality stock. Even
(ten. h e a vy culling may be

aninlals which the less favor .
a b|c genes have “clicked.” The
j erse y cow (necessarily inbred
bec . ause of *e restricted area
of its original habitat) is an ex-
ample of what may be achieved
by inbreeding. More recent ex-
amples occur in the pocket-
sized dogs produced in America,
and in the sex-selective (by
coloration) fowls now being
experimented with in Australia,
Specific examples within breeds
can be seen in some of the
famous studs which have laid
the emphasis on production in
dairy cows, or in speed or
stamina, etc., in horses,
With the average herd line
breeding will be a failure. Im-
provement should be effected in
these cases by bringing in good
qualities from outside—by out-
crossing. If you decide that your
herd is good enough for line-
breeding it will be necessary to
make a close study of the
methods employed. Mates must
be selected with the greatest
care, and in all cases sires must
be proven before being exten-
sively used.
Tetanus,
“Myrr”; At shearing and
lamb-marking it is a danger, and
Victorian departmental veteri-
.narians recommend the follow-
ing: Disinfect shearing-sheds
and pens jyith a phenol or
carbolic-acid solution; cleanse
and disinfect combs, cutters and
shears at regular intervals; dis-
infect all wounds immediately
they occur; keep the pens free
of wool and sheep manure;
water for dust as required, and
release sheep from the pens as
quickly as possible after shear-
ing or marking. For lambs, use
temporary yards erected on
clean ground, well away from
locations where stock congre-
gate. On badly-infected pro-
perties, if weather permits, put
the sheep through a carbolic dip.
Contour Levels.
“L.P.”: When bringing water
for long distances around the
hills from a spring to a dam, or
when putting out a drain to pick
up the catchment from a gully,
the problem is how to keep
correct levels. A surveyor
would soon mark the course—at
a price. A layman can do it
“Be patient, Ma! One at a time!”

known as the letter A because
of its shape. It is made from

timber, with a 12ft. span be-
tween the feet of the A. Mark
the legs 1 and 2. Suspend a
plumb-line from the apex to
the crossbar. Stand the A on
a level floor or straight-edge
(checked with a spirit-level) and
mark the place (dead centre)
where the plumb-line shows on
the crossbar. Then, so as to
give sufficient fall for the water
to run, put marks lin. each side
of the centre one, Mark the
centre one A, the one nearest
leg 1 as B and the other as C.
Thus B is 2in. from C, with A
as piumb centre
1° operate the thing start
from the spring, where the water
is to come from, by placing
No. 2 leg at the intake, then
adjust No. 1 until the plumb-
line shows at B on the crossbar,
Mark the position of No. 1 leg
and then bring No. 2 leg to
there, carrying No. 1 leg on
until the plumb-line shows on
B again. And so on, marking
the positions of the legs as you
go. Work in reverse (plumb-
line to C) if running a drain out
(uphill) from a dam to pick up
water from a distant catchment.
Maintaining the Diesel.
“Radian”; Above all, a diesel
requires good compression, clean
fuel and efficient injection.
Valves should receive frequent
attention and regular cleaning. If
let go indefinitely they develop
warped heads, become badly
pitted and must be replaced be-
fore full compression can be
restored.
Valve - seats suffer through
lack of attention, and eventually
become a job beyond the aver-
age owner. ‘
Removing the valves follows
petrol-engine practice, except
that many diesels have valve-
cages, thus allowing the valves
to be taken out without remov-
ing the cylinder-head. Watch
carefully the way things come
apart, so that you can assemble
them accordingly. Be careful
not to mix the valves. For
cleaning don’t use cotton-waste
if old shirt or dress material is
available. Don’t use a file to
clean valve faces or seats. If
they’re badly carboned, soak in
kerosene, then scrape gently
with an old knife-blade. Valve-
guides coated internally with a
sticky wax may be cleared by
smearing the stem of the particu-
lar valve with liquid metal-polish
and working it in the gummed
guide. Pure phenyl will dis-
lodge the sticky deposit so com-
mon to the internal parts of
diesel engines.
When grinding the valves use
a fine grade of grinding com-
pound thinned in accordance
with maker’s directions until it
will almost run off the valve-
face. Rotate the valve to and
fro in the seat, using light pres-
sure and lifting often to dislodge
any grit which tends to become
embedded in the metal. Valves
and seats in good order show a
sharply-defined ring throughout
their whole circumference. This
ring varies, but is usually from
one-sixteenth of an inch to one-
eighth of an inch wide. The
ring widens as running hours
mount and the valve wears
deeper into the seat. Wide seats
should be avoided as far as pos-
sible, and for this reason a valve
should only be ground to show
an efficient seating—no more.
To check the seating clean the
face and seat thoroughly, draw
a series of pencil lines across
the face close together and for
the full circumference of the
valve. Press the valve into the
seat, rotate slowly for a full
turn and withdraw. If seating
correctly the pencil lines will be
wiped out evenly right round
the valve-face and will show as
an unbroken line on the seat.
Before reassembling make
sure that all traces of grinding
compound have been removed.
Smear valve-faces and -seats
with clean oil when replacing;
also make sure that all spring-
retaining cotters go properly
into place as they are fitted.
When tightening - down a
cylinder - head or valve - cage
don’t fully tighten any single
nut at a time. Work alternately
from side to side, nipping the
nuts up evenly as you go. This
prevents distortion of machined
faces and ensures an even ten-
sion over the gasket. Finally,
adjust valve-clearances to the
maker’s specifications, usually
stamped on a plate somewhere
round the cylinder-head or
valve-cover. For this purpose it
pays to buy or borrow a proper
thickness-gauge.
Black Polls in N.T.*
“Archaps”: By 1950 J. M.
Newman, Cabu 1 c h a Stud,
D’Aguilar, near Brisbane, hopes
to have all Aberdeen-Angus on
his Anthony’s Lagoon property
in the N.T. In the first round
of this year’s muster 1000 calves
were branded, of which over
half were black, and it is ex-
pected that this percentage will
probably hold good throughout
the branding of about 3000
calves. The station last year
turned 27 pure-bred bull calves
out with the herd cattle. It
carries 200 pedigree breeders,
and should brand at least 150
calves from stud cows this year.
Anthony’s Lagoon has not
hitherto recorded and registered
calves from stud cows, but two
paddocks are now being fenced
for stud-breeding, and it is an-
ticipated that within a few years
the station will be producing not
only all its own requirements in

The Poultry House. .
“Jock”: Build it with regard
to these factors —convenience in
working, durability, ventilation,
comfort for birds, ample light
and sunlight and sufficient space.
Allow 4 sq. ft. of floor
space per hen. Put the roosting
perches in the rear of the house
over netting or a pit to facilitate
removal of droppings and to
prevent contact between hens
and droppings. For convenience
in working it is advisable to
plan the house thoughtfully be-
fore erection or to approach an
expert for a diagram.
Arrange nests, troughs and
feeders so that as much service
as possible is given without get-
ting into the house. Good venti-
lation, but protection from
draughts, ample light and a
daily period during which direct
sunlight-falls into the house are
necessary to maintain healthy
birds.
Renovating Old Land.
“Sarina”: Giving old land a
spell under grass is a good way
of renovating it. Stock may
be grazed on the area and their
manure will be beneficial, but
some precautions are necessary.
A neighbor allowed native
grasses to get a start on an old
cane-paddock, then made the
error of turning cattle previously
grazed on weed-ridden country
on to it. The result is that now,
two or three years later, the
whole paddock is thickly
covered with tall flannel weeds
and assorted burrs, and the
farmer must plough them in at
the height of their seeding. He
could have avoided this by keep-
ing cattle carrying weed-seeds
off his paddock.
It is not wise to rest land in-
fested with couch-grass. The
grass only increases in growth
and may become quite uncon-
trollable, even though grazed.
Paspalum can be ploughed out
and destroyed successfully, and
so can most native grasses.
Overstocking should not be'
practised unless the growth of
grass is excessive; it always en-
courages weed growth, which
will persist and be troublesome
when the land is recropped.
Sow a legume crop, such as
cowpea, crotalaria or blue
lupins, after the first ploughing,
and plough it in when matured,
following which the area should
be in excellent shape for re-
cropping.
Townsville Lucerne.
“Chappie”: Townsville
lucerne has responded well to
superphosphate in C.S.I.R. pas-
ture trials at Rodds Bay, Glad-
stone, a sample from one of the
plots laid down in January,
1947, measuring up to 3ft. Be-
fore being sown the paddock
was given a light scratching with
a Mitchell pasture renovator,
and the seed was surface sown.
The trials include 15 different
fertiliser treatments with varying
quantities of super. (0, 1,2, 4
and Bcwt. per acre) and potash
(0, 1 and 2cwt. per acre) and
combinations of these. Towns-
ville lucerne is growing in
several small paddocks about
the house at Rodds Bay. It grows
better than natural grasses on
some of the poorer types of soil,
and it also grows well where
spear-grass does well. The
owners of the property are
anxious, however, to get it estab-
lished as widely as possible, be-
cause of the beneficial effect a
legume can have on soil fer-
tility and carrying capacity, but
difficulty has been experienced
in getting seed.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A,”: Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture recommends
sodium fluoride for roundworm
in pigs, a 1 p.c. mixture of the
drug in the feed as the optimum
dose. Compute accurately the
daily ration of the pig and add
sodium at the rate of 11b. to
every 1001 b. of food, mixing
thoroughly. Pigs destined for
pork should be treated twice
during their lifetime.
“Bai”: Cod-liver oil will pre-
vent rickets in puppies. Beef
bones are a help in keeping
worms in check, whilst calcium
phosphate will help to build up
a strong constitution. From five-
to eight - weeks - old puppies
need four or five feeds a day,
after which the time between
feeds can be lengthened. After
six months two feeds daily
should suffice.
“L.G.A.”: Useful poultry
feeding-troughs may be made
from old truck tyres. Use a
hand-saw lubricated with soapy
water and cut the tyres round
centre of tread for the full cir-
cumference, thus making two
troughs from each tyre.
“Sarina”: The bigger the run
the healthier the poultry. Where
there is overcrowding any con-
tagious disease that breaks out
claims a number of victims be-
fore it is noticed. Fowl ticks
and lice are usually plentiful in
the small pen. If the fowlrun
takes in portion of the farm
orchard the fruit-trees will bene-
fit from fowls scratching and
keeping the soil loose under
them, and, in addition, the fowls
will destroy insect pests attack-
ing the trees.
“W. Court”: When a lamp-
wick becomes too short it can
be used for a while by sewing
on a length of old hat-felt of
the same width. A complete
wick may be cut out of hat-felt
if necessary, but it is likely to
injure the wick-mechanism and
ruin the burner. Get a new
wick as soon as possible,
“Sundowner”: Common win-
ter pests of the cabbage patch,
such as white butterfly, dia-
mond-backed moth and grey
aphis, dan be kept down by
spraying (on a fine, calm day, if
possible) with nicotine sulphate,
one fluid ounce to four gallons
water.
“Big Billy”: On all fast-
working machines nuts will fre-
quently work loose and eventu-
ally fall off. It’s a good plan in
the mornings when oiling-up to
check on likely offenders and
tighten them.
“Nubis”: When the installa-
tion of self-feeders is not prac-
ticable a good idea is to have
the hay-stack or -shed just in-
side the fence of the dairy en-
closure. Feeders can then be
erected outside the fence and
opposite the stack, so that the
hay can be forked directly into
them. A post-and-rail fence
with 9in. vertical boards around
the bottom will suffice for
feeders. If it is preferred to
have the stack in the paddock
the feeders can be built next to
the stack fence.
“Warragul”; As a solvent for
rusted nuts and frozen machine
parts crush and dissolve a cake
of camphor in a small bottle of
common eucalyptus. This mix-
ture has much greater penetrat-
ing power than kerosene and is
faster in action.

with a grunt as she reached the
ground. She lay there panting
until she caught her breath,
“Roger Harnbee a school-
master,” she wheezed, straighten-
ing her hat. “Him and those
forms' they kept sending him.
Good heavens! He could hardly
write his own name.”
“Fancy.”
“Anything but a school-
master,” the old woman pro-
tested. Then, abruptly, seeming
to feel some respect was due,
she said “Ah yes, I lost him in
the flood, you know. Mixing
the, mash I was that morning
when I sees him making along
the river bank looking for a
rabbit for his' dog.”
“I am sorry,” Mrs, Seelye-
Hunt mumbled awkwardly.
“The banks has been fixed
since he was drowned,” the old
woman went on. “They never
found his gun.”
Little Wanda was whispering
again into her mother’s ear,
“What’s the girlie say?” Lai
asked.
“She was wondering about
the dog.”
“A fine retriever.”
WITH a husband out of the
way Mrs. Seelye-Hunt felt
more certain, of her ground.
“And to think she’d bear a
grudge all these years. It wasn’t
as if you married the school-
master.”
“Ah no,” the old woman said,
“we never married, him being
so unsettled.” Propped against
the tree, she toyed with the bag
of acorns in her lap. The moon
shone on her face. When she
spoke again she gazed up with
new intentness. The story of
her acorns was defiant in her
eyes, and its course shaped her
lips: “I just kept him on as a
boarder.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt gave a
daring giggle.
“Ah yes, we caused some talk,
me and the schoolmaster, I can
tell you. But the committee
knew when they had a good
man, and you could see by the
way he walked about that hb
didn’t give a rap for the lot of
them.”
Old Lai paused to watch
Wanda sliding about in a half-
hearted search for acorns, but
her interest caused the child to
leave off self-consciously.
“It was a grand sight to see
him crossing the wire,” the old
woman mused. “That was where
I saw him first.” She lay now
with her eyes closed. “I mind it
well. And Roger there rooting
out trees' in Daniel’s orchard.
Just back along the bank there.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt tugged at
her fur coat. The night was get-
ting cold. She wanted to go
home, but didn’t know how to
leave gracefully.
“He’s a fine lump of a man
for a schoolmaster.”
Those rambling words, as the
listening woman heard them im-
patiently, were an indulgence
granted in the hearing to a
grubby old woman. But the Lai
Harnbee who was hearing them
again was a dimpled hoyden
swinging her legs out of an
apple-tree, and the chilliness of
the night was the stimulus’ of
frosty sunshine in which spider-
webs hung bejewelled.
“He’s a fine lump of a man
for a schoolmaster.”
| T was her husband who spoke
1 to her now. A weedy man, un-
shaven and with a peak-shaped
head, he stood waist-deep* in a
hole. The pair of them were
watching from the orchard, to-
wards which the stream flowed
and then curved away, rippling
only at the poles of the “wire”
—a fence style of footbridge
stretched above the water.
The schoolmaster had come
whistling along the track and
was crossing in great easy
strides. He had a mane of black
hair swept back and a thick
moustache. Brass fittings' of the
case he carried caught the sun.
He was moving with speed, but
so smoothly that the poles, stab-
bing loose in the gravel, were
hardly rocked.
There was no greater confi-
dence than that with which his
hands reached out. He passed
across as a focus of virility
against the morning, a figure of
such splendid arrogance that the
thrill of it haunted the woman
watching from the orchard.
Something of the spirit of the
place went with him. The stream
lav glassily inert, grey almost,
and the willows stood lifeless
and bare.
She felt that something of life
had been drawn from herself,
too, and an urge to redeem it
possessed her. There was about
her an air of assurance almost a
match for the schoolmaster’s in
kind as, having gathered the tea
things, she stepped briskly down
the hedge-line, swinging her
basket and feeling the crispness
of frosty grass underfoot...
But her bones had kept sting-
ing record of nearly half a cen-
tury’s frosts since then, and she
shivered now in the night mist
drifting through the trees.
“Ah yes,” she said, stating
achievement simply, “we got him
for a boarder.”
Seelye-Hunt had a surge of
pity rebuffed by old Lai’s wist-
ful pride.
Little Wanda was whispering
again into her mother’s ear.
\ /HAT’S the girlie say?”
“ * asked the old woman a
little wearily.
“She wondered who fed the
dog.”
“Dog?”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt’s reply was
respectfully hushed. “When
Mr. Harnbee didn’t come back.”
The old woman thought for a
moment. “The schoolmaster,”
she said. “Yes, I remember the
schoolmaster feeding him. And
didn’t my husband think a lot
of that dog! ” She made this ob-
servation wonderingly, and
seemed about to tell more, but
checked herself,
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt was
genuinely affected, though in-
stinctively she sensed, too, that
sentiment could be turned to her
advantage. “Mr. Harnbee was
fond of animals?”
The old woman roused herself.
“I’ll always say that for him,”
she declared, “he was good to
animals. He was out getting a
rabbit for his dog when—ah yes,
I told you about that.”
“It’s very sad.” Mrs, Seelye-
Hunt turned to her daughter as
if to point the moral of it, but
began to sniffle without finding
the words. “But it’s beautiful,
too.”
“Not that you could blame the
dog,” old Lai put in quickly,
suspicious of the other woman’s
interest.
She raised herself up labori-
ously and began to waddle away.
“And I’m sure it’s because of
that he’d like to be remem-
bered,” Mrs. Seelye-Hunt pur-
sued, loath to leave sentimen-
tality untasted.
The old woman turned and
chuckled wryly. “It’s funny
about remembering him. I re-
member him best as a big man,
as big as the schoolmaster. And
that’s not right, you know.”
“But he always wanted to be
big?” Mrs. Seelye-Hunt asked
shrewdly. She was well set now
on her morbid course.
“He always talked big. About
all the money he was going to
make.”
“Poor old bear.” Mrs. Seelye-
Hunt was close to tears. As they
crossed the track together she
slid her arm round the old
woman. “Remembering him
like that. Just like he’d want to
be.”
“He’s wearing the school-
master’s clothes and black bow-
tie ; and I see him on the wire,”
old Lai blurted out, not as a
shameful confession but as a
statement of puzzling phenome-
non. “But it’s only his face I
see. His face on the school-
master.”
Mrs. Seelye-Hunt dabbed at
her eyes. “Oh, it’s beautiful.”
'T' HEY climbed the bank with-
* out speaking. Mrs. Seelye-
Hunt was busy jig-stepping her
way through the scrub, and the
old woman, plodding on heavily,
was suspicious of her escort’s
behavior. Their silence had be-
come acute embarrassment by
the time they’d reached the wire.
The old woman stopped for a
moment to shake her bag of
acorns confusedly, “You’d be
surprised to see how quick a
pig gets a taste for acorns,” she
said.
Then with a brief good-night
she was making her ungainly
way across the stream. The pole
lurched precariously, making
moonlight designs in the water
until she’d merged with the
shadows on the other side and
was gone.
“G’bye,” sobbed Mrs. Seelye-
Hunt, waving her handkerchief
from the bank. “G’bye, poor
old bear,”
Back among the oaks her child
Wanda slid about gaily in a
search for acorns, her red coat a
fugitive smudge of color.

BRIAN BUREAU.
The Same Difference.
“A spokesman for the British Coal
Board, while admitting that operations
for the year of the nationalised coal
industry had resulted in a loss of over
£23,000,000, said that this would not
come out of the taxpayers’ pockets.
Future operations of the Board might
result in a profit.”
Asked whether the taxpayer
would bear the cost of trans-
porting and feeding the large
herd of Parliamentary deadheads
who journeyed to the northern
N.S.W. coalfields district to
watch him trespass on private
land to fire a shot and so try to
kid voters at an imminent by-
election that his Cabinet was de-
termined to do for a change
something not connected with
booze or betting, Premier Mc-
Girr stated definitely that this
was not the case. Not one tax-
payer would be called upon to
pay a halfpenny more. His de-
partmental experts had worked
it out that the few paltry thou-
sands spent on the important
function, including cost of his

to us."
silver spade, panned out at less
than a farthing for each man,
woman and child in the State*
As nobody could be billed for
less than a farthing this meant
that nobody paid anything.
Could any Tory Government
point to such consideration for
the taxpayer? Instead of issu-
ing misleading figures, critics of
his Government should be prais-
ing it for not having indulged in
an orgy of spending. “Any-
way,” concluded the Bankstown
Blancmange, “the real sod I
turned —and I’m speaking purely
in an agricultural sense, mind
you—was actually worth, if they
only stopped to realise it, many
thousands of pounds in the tax-
payers’ pockets—or at least it
should round about 1989.”
“It would be quite wrong,”
said Boneless Ben, the Bathurst
Wonder, “to say that the mil-
lions of man-hours of which in-
dustry has been deprived this
year through industrial unrest
not entirely unconnected with
the activities of a certain party
which subscribes to a
particular political
philosophy, the legality
of which an enlightened
democrkcy must not
only recognise but help
along, means that pro-
duction to that extent
has been adversely
affected. The time lost
has probably been
more than made up by
the extra effort made by
the workers when they
resume after a strike,
owing not only to the
elated feeling of getting
back to the job after a
holiday, but also to the
knowledge that we’ve
granted every demand
they made. In point of
fact, the Com—er—the
party which embraces
a certain political
philosophy seems actu-
ally to be doing a
power of good by their
engineering of stop-
pages and thus in-
directly causing a verit-
able flood of produc-
tion. It is the press trying
to make political capital out
of unrest that- is world-wide,
and about which no Govern-
ment can dd anything—they
would crucify the workers if
they could.
“Another thing of which the
capitalist press makes a mouth-
ful,” went on the Boneless
Wonder, “is the increase in the
number of appointments to
Government boards and depart-
merits. They say, for example,
that by adding another 282 to
the staff of the Mangelwurzel
Board productive industry has
been robbed of that many
workers. How fallacious this
reasoning is is quite clear. Won’t
the extra loss incurred by the
board mean, for one thing, the
use of extra adding-machines to
tot-up the bigger losses? Mul-
tiply this by several hundred
boards, and the extra employ-
ment involved in the manu-
facture of adding-machines is
simply colossal —and that is only
one item. What of the addi-
tional labor needed by the man
on the land when he is ordered
to plough half his mangelwurzel
crop under again so that that par-
ticular commodity will be scarce
and dear —the object of all well-
planned socialist economy? It
is obvious that, by expanding
the personnel of boards and de-
partments fivefold as we are
doing, prosperity for all is
guaranteed. Government
revenue is kept buoyant, and I
confidently anticipate that within
two months of the next elections
the Golden Age will burst upon
us in all its glorious effulgence! ”
“The fact, ladies and gentle-
men,” said the chairman of
directors at the annual general
meeting, “that we have had to
pass a dividend this year need
not be taken as a sign that the
company is in the business dol-
drums. Far from it! Directors’
fees are greater than ever before.
Manufacturing expenses are at
an all-time high. Creditors’ ac-
counts have reached positively
astronomical figures. Our bank
overdraft has reached a peak
never attained, I’m sure, by any
of our rivals. Bad debts con-
tinue to touch new heights. No
other company of comparable
size can boast so large a deficit
on trading. It would be ridicu-
lous to suggest that shareholders
have suffered a loss —everyone
will leave this meeting with
exactly the same amount in his
pocket or in her purse as when
he or she entered!”

Rabbits
I used to make pretty good money trap-
ping rabbits, and recently decided to have
another crack at it. For a start it didn’t
look too promising. Tacked on trees and
posts all along the road to my old trap-
ping-grounds were those calico notices
stating that “the 18th day of February,
1948, has been a day on and after which
the simultaneous destruction of rabbits
shall be commenced and continued by
every occupier and owner of land
throughout the State of Victoria,” and
threatening prosecution for those who
failed to comply. It seemed as if the
authorities had declared outright war on
the bunny, and that landowners would be
on the job, too, since wool was bringing
record prices and 10 rabbits eat more
grass than a sheep.
Wherever I’ve “set” during the subse-
quent months, however, I’ve found that
most of the burrows and pop-holes
through netting-fences that I used to
trap on 10 years ago are still there. Land-
holders complaining that they cannot get
netting apparently make no attempt to
keep existing fences rabbitproof.
Rabbit-destruction, in this district,
seems to amount to laying a few poison
trails; very' weak attempts to annihilate
the grazier’s greatest menace —in one
area where 30 to 40 rabbits were poisoned
I’ve since trapped 150, and other trappers
have had even better catches.
Still, everybody’s happy. Trappers have
made big cheques, and are sure they will
do the same next year. Schoolboys with
their ferrets have made good pocket-
money on week-ends, and landowners
report (as they always do) that rabbits
have never been scarcer around their
places. The rabbits that have survived
should also be happy because, when the
last trapper pulls out, they will be left un-
molested to multiply furiously, and by
next season will be overrunning the
country again.
With a little organisation rabbits could
be wiped out in most Victorian districts.
In most cases poisoning is useless be-
cause rabbits killed that way would have
been trapped a few weeks later. Trappers
operate while rabbits are plentiful enough
to make the game profitable, and when
they finish the bunnies are fairly scarce.
From then on is the pest’s most favorable
breeding period, and the best time to
make an all-out attack on them.
The Lands Department, instead of put-
ting up calico notices and laying poison
trails, should dig out or fumigate those
thousands of little burrows on Crown
lands which have been breeding-grounds
for years. Landowners should do the
same on their properties. A whiff of
fumigant in a small burrow at breeding-
time means the death of about five young
rabbits. Big warrens should be isolated
as soon as wire-netting becomes available.
Trappers are often criticised because
they operate only while it is profitable to
do so. What more could be expected
of them? But if those who criticised
carried on from where the trapper left
off they could rid themselves of their
worst pest. —L. P. (Vic.).
WUd Pigs
Increasing hordes of wild pigs are caus-
ing n.-Queensland farmers no end of
trouble —they have been known to eat
sheep, they readily attack drought-
weakened cattle and play the devil with
crops and fences.
The pigs often appear at station killing-
pens in search of offal, and this is an.
excellent opportunity to poison them.
Although poisons such as arsenic and
strychnine Will not always kill them,"
there is a brew known as S.A.P. which
never fails. A little of this molasses-like
substance spread in a carcass will
account for every pig that tries it,
Some shires pay a bonus of 6d. a snout,
but that’s not sufficient to make pig-hunt-
ing a full-time occupation, — John Leslie
(Vic.).
Self Help
I recently witnessed a general strike in
the N. S, Wales south-coast town of
Bega as a protest against the Govern-
ment’s delay in building a new hospital.
The town band led the procession, play-
ing “Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?”,
Kelly being the State Minister for Health.
It was a spectacular procession, and I
am convinced that Bega, like many other
country towns, badly needs a new hos-
pital ; biff in my fancy I saw, watching
the display, the ghosts of the old pioneers
who carved their homes out of the bush
and battled along without Government
grants, subsidies, child endowment and
the like. Had they wanted a hospital
they would have called a meeting, not to
protest to the Government, but to raise
funds and to organise working bees to do
the job.
When the old-timers wanted a road to
their farms they got together and made
it; if it was a bridge, they felled timber
and carted stone to the site and built it.
When a man was in trouble he did not
ask for Government assistance. His
mates got to work and gave him a hand.
Around country districts now you can
see dozens of little dance-halls, churches
and other amenities that were built in
this spirit.
Of course the Government could do
much towards helping country people,
but in both country and city we could
do much more to help ourselves —
especially if income taxes were reduced. —
W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
Torres Strait Islanders
A recently-published book called The
Isles of Torres Strait, by one Gerald
Peel, opens with the statement that it was
written after a Torres Strait islander,
then serving as first mate on American
small naval ships, had come to the author
in the Communist-party offices in George-
street, Sydney, to enlist his help for the
oppressed people of North Australia,
The islander “spoke perfect English
with a slight American drawl,” and was
“You can reverse now, Tom —there's nothing
behind us.”
intelligent enough to he invited to tea
at the author’s home, where he said that
“No one but the Communists are likely
to do anything about the wrongs of my
people” and that he felt “like back home”
when he mixed with Australian or Ameri-
can Communists. He had read books on
political economy lent him by an Aus-
tralian Communist on board ship, and
was able to tell the author of the bad
conditions under which he and others
had to work on Japanese pearling boats
before the war. He also “spoke with
great scorn of the ‘Protector’ officer of
the Queensland Government.” The
islander contributed such an amount of
information on the misrunning of things
in general that the author set to work,
dug up Government reports, writings of
other authors and island visitors, mis-
sionary records and so forth, and pro-
duced the enlightening volume. One epi-
sode of the islander-guest’s gratitude is
recorded:
After tea [he] insisted with, great gallantry
on washing-up with me and would not
allow my wife to touch the dishes. “At
home,” he said, “that is man’s work; we
do not allow our women to do that,” and
he then proceeded not only to wash the
dishes but to scrub every bit of coal-soot
off the pots accumulated during three
years’ life on the northern coalfields.
The island gentleman’s private opinion
of his hosts who hadn’t cleaned the pots
isn’t recorded. A
After 19 chapters of interesting infor-
mation ranging over early discovery,
social conditions and various administra-
tive and other problems, the author en-
visages a completely new autonomous
region with sovereign integral rights for
the people (including the right to secede
from the Commonwealth at any time), the
region to take in all the islands of the
Strait and a slice of Papua, in the Fly
River district, with Thursday Island as
the capital. White enterprise would be
barred, and Commonwealth (instead of
Queensland) officials would police and
enforce the law. The question of mili-
tary bases would be worked out between
the Commonwealth and the new State.
There is much that could be quoted,
but the final paragraph will do:
All these demands of the people must
have the full support of the Australian
Labor movement; and it is probable that
it will be precisely around joint struggle
for such demands that Australian-Torres
Strait Labor and democratic unity will be
forged, and the struggle for democratic
internal autonomy within the Common-
wealth will develop. Communists will sup-
port, with all they have, all democratic
demands which may be put forward by the
Torres Strait people in the years to come.
The islands carry a population of
roughly 5000, and are very important,
commercially and strategically. More than
700 of the men served in the Torres
Strait Native Infantry, at Horn Island
and elsewhere; a number went overseas
with the forces. I know them well —
they’re fine fellows —and I should be very
sorry indeed to see them led by Commo
blather into another Indonesian tum-up.
But the book indicates how breaths of
former discontent are being used by the
Commos. — Waibenite (Tas.).
Exit, One (1) Fortune-teller
Although the N.S.W. Police Depart-
ment periodically complains—and nearly
always during an outbreak of crimes of
violence —that it is chronically short of
officers, it seems to have more than
enough for trivial assignments. In
February it had three ( 3 ) on the job of
catching a middle-aged musician who had
done three months for telling fortunes.
The fellow lived in Balmain, and two
policewomen met him in his; house by
appointment. When they had got their
evidence, which amounted to the familiar
silly stuff, “read”
from a female hand
and a crystal ball, a
man from the Bal-
main police-station
entered without a
warrant, forcing a
door, and arrested
the luckless peerer-
into-the-future; and
Sargeson, S.M., said
“Six months.”
There was an
appeal to Quarter
Sessions, at which
Judge Stacy repri-
manded the arresting
constable, who pro-
tested that he had
“the right” of for-
cible entry. “You
had no right,” the
Judge replied; “a
person’s home is his
castle.” But his
Honor dismissed the
appeal and con-
firmed the sentence,
. remarking of the
practitioner and his
outfit and line of
patter that “Tricking
people into throw-
ing money away is
a poor way of making a living—some
simple girl may go round there and he
may ruin her life.”
“A poor way of making a living” it is,
but if all those who trick Sydney people
into throwing money away were nabbed
and punished, as this obscure specimen
was nabbed and punished, the jails!
wouldn’t hold them. There are many
other rackets, nastier and far more
profitable than fortune-telling. And the
“Government” itself runs lotteries, three
or four a week, wlych draw from a great
many people money they can ill afford,
and from which a strong flavor of super-
stition is never absent. Then there is the
vogue of astrology, fed not only by the
sheet from which Liaison-officer Garden
drew part of the income on which he
“paid over £2OOO a year tax,” but by
“responsible” newspapers issued by at
least three public, companies.
Astrology was exploded in England by
Dean Swift 240 years ago. What is it in
the form current in Sydney but day-by-
day and week-by-week fortune-telling?
But you won’t find the police challenging
the publication of the unspeakable stuff,
with its pseudo-scientific and dangerous
appeal to multitudes of mugs. They pre-
fer going to all sorts of trouble to gather
in the occasional seedy humbug who, for
a florin, pretends to divine, not from the
stars but from palms and a crystal ball,
and who has no powerful interests be-
hind him. —D. E. (N.S.W.).
Outback Roads
Recent cyclonic rains once more em-
phasised the need for adequate roads in
.southern Queensland and northern N. S.
Wales. In the blacksoil areas roads were
impassable for days, while red ridges of
mulga country were death-traps for
motorists. Many of these roads are mere
bush tracks, graded once in months in
closer-settled regions and left to revert
to bogs and ruts with the first rains.
Local authorities and shire councils do
not seem to be greatly concerned. In one
inland town, centre of a prosperous pas-
toral district, a fortune has been spent in
unsuccessful efforts to turf the local sports
arena while moderate rains render most
roads impassable.
Recently two ambulances on emergency
missions in southern Queensland were
bogged on main roads and there remained
until relief parties towed them to firmer
ground several hours later. Air trans-
port has had to be used to carry food to
isolated communities and patients to hos-
pitals. ' .
The solution lies not in maintenance
and repair of existing graded-earth roads
but in the construction of permanent all-
weather roads of gravel or bitumen and
of high-level bridges.— Atlanta (Q.).
Country “Demmos”
Before “Carlyle” castigates Victoria’s
firemen for attending their annual
“demmos” (B. 7/7/’4B) he should realise
that most of them are volunteers who fight
fires as a duty to their community and
hardly get thanks for it. Should they
wish they could resign from their brigades
and let the whole State burn.
Their annual “demmos” are a training
necessity. They last only a few days and
the firemen are absent for a week at the
most. Efficiency would soon drop if this
competitive spirit was not encouraged by
the Country Fire Brigades Board.
Even when the firemen take their
annual break a few experienced hands are
always left to care for the town. The
fires quoted by “C,” would probably have
occurred whether there was a “demmo”
on or not, as half Victoria’s country
towns are in such a dilapidated condition.
Victoria’s country firemen are laps
ahead of those in other States, thanks to
an efficient board which believes in
friendly, sporting competition.— Waddlin’

“Business Couples*’
Many ads. offering accommodation
stipulate tenants must be “business
couples.” This has nothing to do with
social status —it is simply a guarantee to
the lessor that premises for which the
couple may be asked to pay £5 a week
will be free of their presence during the
day.
I was recently offered part of a house
(its unfurnished rent would be about £2
a week) for £5 a week, with electricity
but not gas bills paid, and no linen, cut-
lery or blankets. The landlady was eager
for assurance that my wife and I would
be out all day. In effect, we would have
been paying £5 a week for sleeping
quarters, £3 of which would cover the
meagre furniture the place carried.
When I said that my 60-year-old mother
would occupy the spare bedroom, the
deal was off.
I was at the war, and my wife works
to swell the bank balance so that we can
eventually have our own home. In the
meantime, searching for temporary ac-
commodation, we’ve struck some pretty
hungry sharks, but the “business-couple”
breed we’ve met are the hungriest.—
Conda (N.S.W.).
Measles and Abos.
An epidemic of measles is taking heavy
toff of abos in Central Australia. More
than 160 have died this year, and lately
the disease has spread to Hermannsburg
and Areyonga—7o cases have been re-
ported at each mission—and it is feared
it may spread further north.
Unfortunately, as far as the Binghi
is concerned, there is only one practical
way to arrest an epidemic, and that is by
its prevention. Cures are practically im-
possible with patients .who are apt to
invite pneumonia by throwing off their
blankets or, worse, by diving into water-
holes to cool off. Anyway, bush tribes
don’t bother about sick patients. At the
first signs of a scourge they abandon
them to die, disperse in small groups
over the landscape and don’t congregate
again until the all-clear has been given.
Today in Central Australia, with
stations, missions. Government com-
pounds and towns, the abo. is deprived
of his natural facilities of segregating the
sick and “going bush.” Moreover, away
from- the guidance of The elders, this
primitive instinct is -often lost to young
blacks.
Epidemics like measles are by no means
uncommon among aborigines these days-
What this particular one means is that
natives in the Centre will become extinct
a little sooner than expected. This is be-
cause any practical scheme to save them!
such as dividing Central Australia in hall
and segregating the blacks away from
prospectors, missions and stations, won t
ever mature. Governments, * apparently
cannot afford to lose the pittance the}'
get from odd pastoral . and mining leases,
nor to pay a few reliable men to police
such an aboriginal sanctuary. — Horse-
less Horseman (Vic.).


Ward’s Territory
Conceived during the later war years
and delivered when the peace offensive
hit us, the Town Planning Authority for
Papua-New Guinea has effectively re-
tarded building for three years.
It’s hard to pin down this elusive
T.P.A. Applications for building-blocks
in Lae —some lodged as far back as 1945
—have been refused on the ground that
it has not finally “come to a decision.”
First move was when a small body of
officials from Australia inspected the
town and pored over plans and recom-
mendations. They disappeared in a
southerly direction and cast up in Can-
berra, and their report, in more or less
coherent form, was eventually dispatched
to Moresby for comment. There it was
found that too much of the Lae inspec-
tion had been done from the inside of
offices —several of the recommended allot-
ments were situated in swamp. This in-
telligence was swiftly passed to Canberra,
and was followed by a lengthy silence
until the publication of the Lae plan a
few months back.
Meanwhile, building generally is fol-
lowing no set pattern. In Wau, houses
have been built on the outskirts of the
former town site and kunai grows over
the best and most convenient blocks. Not
even a preliminary survey has been made
of Wau (nor of Madang or Finschhafen),
and the Administration has stated that
any “unauthorised” building erected in
Wau or Lae will be subject to official re-
sumption if the eventual town plan so
requires.
Some explanation of the delay may be
found in Commonwealth policy. It
has been mentioned both locally and
over the national news that U.N.O. still
has a large say in the former Mandated
Territory of New Guinea (notwithstand-
ing Mr. Makin’s resounding assertions),
and that the Malahang area (Lae), at
present occupied by mission people,,is to
be resumed and converted to a world-
class aerodrome under U.N.O.’s direction.
However, Malahang is two miles north-
east of tfye pre-war town site of Lae, and,
as civilians are interested in expansion of
the town westwards towards the war-time-
built wharf, the Malahang proposal
should not interfere.with the allotment
of main town blocks.
A firm established at Lae before and
since the war has repeatedly applied for
an allotment, its first application being
lodged in the infancy of the Town Plan-
ning Authority. A letter received this
month from the Lands Department states
“It is not practical just at present to
make allocations of sites before the de-
signed layout of the industrial area has
been finally demarcated on the ground.”
The firm has been occupying makeshift
quarters since the end of the war, and
there appears to be little hope of relief
in the future. If permanent tenure of a
block could be obtained, building would
go ahead immediately.
Meanwhile, many people in the Terri-
tory occupy shacks and shanties. There
are only two alternatives —paying ex-
orbitant hotel tariff or buying land (at
an inflated price) from non-returning New
Guinea residents and taking a chance on
resumption by the authorities. — Lim-
Limbu (N.G.).
Education
Seventy per cent, of the physically fit
who have tried to join the army since re-
cruiting began left school before the mini-
mum leaving age of 14, and one in 12
of these has been rejected because of in-
sufficient education.
This deplorable standard was also en-
countered by Army Education Service
during the war. One A.E.S. school was
held in Bougainville within an infantry
group of about 2000 men, and, from the
number who attended the school and
the number who applied for second and
subsequent schools (which were never
held), it was conservatively estimated that
there were 200 in the group who could
not read, write and do simple arithmetic,
but might be able to do one of the three.
Going by that cross-section, there were
at least 50,000 sub-educated men in the
Army. So much for our boast of free
and compulsory education! Our educa-
tion authorities should insist on a cer-
tain standard, instead of a certain age,
before a girl or boy leaves school.—
S.E.B. (Q.).
Queensland Coal
Despite Communist opposition from
N. S. Wales, it seems that some of
Queensland’s coal deposits are to be
worked after all. Premier Kanlon has
given an assurance that the State has
not heard the last of the British com-
pany’s plans for Blair Athol, and coal-
starved Victoria is negotiating for Biloela
(Callide) coal. In the meantime Victoria
has sought coal from England, and South
Australia from South Africa.
It is surprising that those two States
should look for high-priced overseas coal
without first investigating all local
avenues of supply. Anyone with but a
skimpy knowledge of central Queens-
land would go no further for coal.
It took an Englishman who heard a
wireless broadcast on Queensland to put
Blair Athol, with its open-cut faces of
coal as high as a six-story building,' in
its rightful place on the Australian map ;
and it took a Queensland contractor to
bring Biloela, with its open-cut face as
high as a four-story building, to Vic-
toria’s notice —despite the fact that the
deposits have been known officially for
a number of years.
Is there no co-operation between States
to solve each other’s problems? The re-
cent Victorian delegation to Biloela knew
nothing of the facilities at the port of
Gladstone, which even geography books
record as one of the finest harbors on the
coast.
Blair Athol and Biloela are now pro-
ducing more than the railway can shift,
and if southern States can find an
answer to Queensland transport problems
they need never go short of coal. If
those two fields are out of their reach,
they might try Byfield, an open-cut mine
near Yeppoon and only a few miles from
the coast, or, again, the enormous deposit
of hard coal recently discovered in the
Bluff area.
There is no shortage of coal in Aus-
tralia—only a shortage of the initiative
to pick it up and carry it to where it is
needed.—S. E. B. (Qld.).
C.R.T.S.
The Commonwealth Reconstruction
Training Scheme has taken more than its
fair share of criticism, particularly from
newspapers. The moment an ex-service-
“Have this prescription made up right away.”
man is refused a course newspaper head-
lines bawl, “Ex-serviceman refused assis-
tance.” It fs conveniently forgotten that
75 per cent, of C.R.T.S, staff are ex-
service people. They know what the ex-
soldier is up against, and their one object
is to help and guide him.
There is usually a simple explanation
for rejected applications—the old story
of square pegs and round holes. The
much scoffed-at “gig test” and thS search-
ing questions about education and family
background are designed to determine
whether the peg is round or square.
I was trained under C.R.T.S., and had
my share of fretting, fuming and waiting,
but at all times my wishes were considered
if possible, and I was finally placed in a
job suited to my pre-war education and
physical standard. I, for one, am grateful
to the “gig-testers,” clerks and instructors,
and to my present employers, a firm that
really co-operates with C.R.T.S. — Swaddy
(Tas.).
“The Missus”
Rightly, Australians have extended
their sympathy to the British people —
the British housewife in particular, for
the hardships she has to endure, the
heavy rationing of food and other neces-
sities, the queues, the cold and the restric-
tions.
That is only as it should be, hut I
suggest that every Australian with a vote
should consider the Australian house-
wife. She also queues, she copes with
rationing and shortages of one necessity
after another. Budgeting is almost an
impossibility for her, as she has to take
things as they come. She must juggle
with rising prices and, a housewife myself,
I know only too well that the cost of
nearly every item of the average house-
hold’s diet has gone up during the last two
years. She carries heavy loads, in spite
of promised home deliveries. Finally,
she can never rely on having power for
cooking, heating or lighting, and, at
present, must risk a heavy fine to cook
outside Government-prescribed hours.
At least British housewives know tliat
they endure hardships so that their
country’s economy can survive. We
haven’t even that satisfaction. — House-
keeper (N.S.W.).
A Shortage Mystery
N.S.W. Premier, McGirr: “The expan-
sion [in secondary industry] has been so
remarkable that there are today in
N.S.W. 13,961 factories compared with
9460 when an anti-Labor Government
was in power.”
What puzzles the average citizen is the
whereabouts of the products of all these
new factories. In the 1930’s you could
get anything in popular demand in reason-
able quantities. If some article was not
in stock it was procurable at short notice.
Now even basic household items are
often hard to get for weeks on end.
I’ve tramped from shop to shop vainly
seeking such things as a half-pound of
sao or wheatmeal biscuits, or of mar-
garine, or a packet of washing-compound.
Women I know have tried to desperation
to get dressmakers to do minor altera-
tions, or have searched for weeks before
finding a suitable pair of shoes. — Lyle
(N.S.W.).
*
Another New State
' The central-west of N. S. Wales is hav-
ing its coldest winter for 10 years, and
householders are feeling Mr. McGirr’s
gas and electricity restrictions very
bitterly. They argue thus;
“We generate enough power at Burren-
juck and Wyangala to supply our needs.
The breakdown in Supply has been
caused by Moscow stooges and loafers in
the Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong area.
To avoid imposing drastic restrictions on
those responsible the McGirr Government
is pinching our electricity from Burren-
juck and Wyangala. Our local Labor
politicians say nothing against this pen-
alising of country people who have to
endure temperatures 20 degrees below
that of Sydney.”
Here in the central-west, too, farmers
are worried because McGirr has cut
goods-trains by 30 per cent., and millions
of bags of wheat need shifting from
country sidings before next harvest.
Potatoes, hay and other produce cannot
be shifted. No coal? Nonsense!
Thousands of tons of our Lithgow coal go
to feed Sydney’s Bunnerong. A State
Government of its own for the central-
west would not hand over coal badly
needed for its own transport and industry.
—F. D. (N.S.W.).
Root of the Matter
Almost daily I see loads of Mt. Gam-
bier (S.A.) limestone on the road to Vic-
toria to be used in building dairies. At
the same time prefabricated sheds are
being brought from N! S. Wales for cow-
sheds on soldier-settlement blocks in the
Mt. Gambier district. I suppose, some-
one gets paid for arranging such things.—
Beyond Me (S.A.).
It is doubtful if Czarist Russia properly
merited the term totalitarian (B.
30/7/’4B). Its absolutism was mainly
political, and there was not the thorough-
going control of industry as in contem-
porary dictatorships. Corruption was not
unknown in Czarist Russia, but it is
notorious in the Soviet, and the latter’s
claim to greater efficiency is also question-
able —Russia’s industrial advance began
before the end of the Czarist regime, and
there is no reason to believe it wouldn’t
have continued had there been no revolu-
tion. Most farming countries have shown
decided industrial development since 1918.
—Glenroy (N.S.W.).
I’m a returned' soldier. Eighteen
months ago, just after our third child
arrived, my wife and I went to live in a
converted Army hut a “temporary”
measure, as we were then trying to build
our own home. After waiting 12 months
for materials we got the chance to buy a
home outright. We sold our land and
bought the house because it carried a
promise of vacant possession within a
month. The month has turned into a
year and we’re still in the hut, making
the best of thin walls and communal
living. As a result of the cold and
draughts, our baby is now in hospital
with pneumonia. Yet when I applied
recently for a Commission-built cottage
my application was refused because “You
have a home already. You don’t need
another one.”—D. R. I. (N.S.W.).
Kelly, the Sydney Minister of Health,
conscious of revolt in the country against
dilapidated, ill-equipped and overcrowded
hospitals, says McGirr will ask the Loan
Council for more money “to complete
improvements.” There was no such hesi-
tation about providing Sydney with the
Eastern Suburbs railway and trams.
Over half a million is to be spent on 100
trams —at £B5OO apiece. The Melbourne
cost is little more than half that—O.-T.
(N.S.W.).
Being a very polite P.M., Attlee prob-
ably never even hinted to Chifley that
Australia might have done better in sup-
plying the British with food. But it seems
significant that the day before Chifley
departed Strachey, the Food Minister,
was moved to announce that the British
calorie intake was only 2800 a head daily
—“sufficient, but only just sufficient.” No
Australian with a heart and conscience
will regard it as nearly sufficient. —
Parcels (Vic.).

The Toowoomba - born Air - Vice -
Marshal Bennett has tried “nationalisa-
tion” as a director and “had” it:
All the privileges are in the hands of the
Minister. There are no dividends, but
there are substantial profits—big cars, aero-
planes, allowances and trips to Australia
at the taxpayers’ expense.
The distinguished Queenslander was talk-
ing of Britain, but his remarks apply
with even greater force to Australia,
where costly imported cars using costly
imported petrol carry “Labor” Ministers,
wives and friends whithersoever they wish
to go. And trips from Australia are not
confined to Ministers. Any “Labor”
member for whom the flimsiest excuse
can be found gets a pleasure jaunt round
the world, with allowances and expenses
drawn from the dollar pool. It doesn’t
end there ; Communist union bosses are
also treated to trips at the taxpayers’ ex-
pense. Britain draws the line at that. —
Brekker C. (Q.).
The crowd at Canberra is fond of call-
ing the private motorist’s petrol issue a
“pleasure ration.” It is only partly that
in • city or country. Much of it is
used for essential family carriage of
people and goods, in emergencies and (in
cities) to get people to work during fre-
quent public-transport failures. Not
much more than 25 p.c. of the average
private issue is reserved for “pleasure,”
and even that means nothing more than
running the family for a picnic or to visit
relatives at the week-end. — Flivver
(N.S.W.).
Although “Labor” directs immigrants
to the timber industry, to canecutting or
fruitpicking, not one Balt, Pole or othef
displaced person has been sent to a coal-
mine. The coal is there 24 hours a
day; the need is there 24 hours a day;
to allow it to be mined a nominal 40
hours a week —actually less —is folly.
But then most of “ ‘Labor’s’ policy”
can be similarly described.—B. J. J. (Vic.).
“In our libraries even essential books
are often lacking” (B. 7/7/’4B). A case
in point: Lord Portsmouth’s Famine in
England, one of the most significant
books on farming written for many years,
is in neither the Sydney Public Library
nor the Sydney Municipal Library. No
representative library should be without
it. — Kanimbla (N.S.W.).
A Federal “Labor” politician who will
regret the Oliviers’ visit to Sydney is
Haylen, now, on the strength of a buck-
shee trip to Europe, “an immigration ex-
pert.” Haylen is a playwright of sorts, and
has been pressing Chifley to find funds for
a “national theatre,” in which Hayler
plays could be presented. In the coursi
of his travels Sir Laurence Olivier wa
alleged to have given the “national-
theatre” project his blessing. This he
denied in Sydney, saying “A ‘national
theatre’ will give you fine theatre build-
ings,” but not the first requirement,
“actors and actresses.” So Haylen went
off to Japan with a flea in his ear. — Anti-
Cant (N.5.W.).,
Some of the older children in a State
mental asylum are permitted to obtain
jobs outside the institution. Two of them
applied to the railways for employment
and both got jobs at £7 10s. a week, in-
cluding overtime. Two of the attendants
at the asylum heard of this and resigned
and joined the railways. By the normal
process of promotion one of the patients
is now a foreman, and among his sub-
ordinates is one of the attendants, —
