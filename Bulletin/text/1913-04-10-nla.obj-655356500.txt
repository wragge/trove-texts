Powder

WHITE TEETH.
This Powder is not only an Antiseptic and
Germicide, but cleanses mechanically, owing
to the evolution of free active oxygen when
the powder is in contact with water or the
oral fluids. It is the oxygen which, by neu-
tralising the acid-producing organisms of de-
cay, and dissolving mischievous deposits,
whitens the teeth so wonderfully, and wards
off decav as no other preparation for the
Teeth can or will do. Scientists _ agree that
a powder is superior to any liquid or paste
for cleansing and preserving the Teeth- The
Committee of the British Dental Association
recommend powder as best for the Teeth.

The Call of the Wandering Jew.
The Red Page
Hot lava floivs in my veins to-night,
My nerves are jangling mad,
The Joy of Life is a tinsel gaud.
The sweetest songs sound sad.
/ feel the drag of the Wanderlust,
I see the ghosts stream by,
I hear the call of old Ahaswer,
And I must go or die.
A horde of ghosts from the grave tramp past,
And each one turns and stares,
And each one smiles and beckons me
To join with my forebears.
And each one stands and tells his tale,
Then grimly passes by,
Each stops and speaks and beckons me,
And I must go or die.
“A slave, new freed, from the land of Ra
/ journeyed the desert on.”
“I hung my harp on a willow tree,
And wept in Babylon.”
“I saw him die on the thorn-crowned Cross.”
‘‘l writhed 'nea.th Roman whips.”
“My blood dyed red the stones of Tyre.”
'T groaned in Punic ships.”
“I wandered forth when the Holy Flame
Lit torches in Castile.”
“I wore the badge of the Ghetto's shame.”
“I died, but ivould not kneel.”
“I fought the Moor in the streets of Fez.”
“/ heard the ‘ HEP’ of hate.”
“J came afresh out of Muscovy.
But yesternight’s Jew bait.”
U I wrote joy songs for the world to sing.”
“I kept a gambling hell.”
“I caught the musio the angels love.”
“I lived to buy and sell.”
“I raised the cm of the toilers' woe.”
“A lord of gold was I.”
~Now Heine, Mendelssohn, Marx with these.
Are tramping, tramping by.
Begrimed by muck of centuries,
.And smoke of holy stakes,
Each bends his head, like the osier,
That bows but never breaks.
The nations rise, the nations war,
The nations fade and die,
They mock, they Mil, but the Jew heeds not,
Goes tramping, tramping by.
Alone comes One who had loved all men,
The man of peace and tears;
His eyes meet mine, and I rise, and stand
Perturbed by doubts and fears.
“Oh! speak the words that tvould clear the
way !
Speak! speak! one word!” I cry;
His eyes are dimmed, but His voice is mute
And He goes tramping by.
But I was born in this Southland sweet,
In it to manhood grown;
I love this land, as I love my life,
I call this land mine own.
Yet, here, to-night, my blood runs maa,
To go with these and roam,
To wander off with these gaunt, grim ghosts
That ever seek a home....
NATHAN F. SPIELYOGEL.
in “Our Gum Trees.”
In Our Gum Trees and (the inevitable)
Other Verses (Harris, 491 George-street,
Sydney, Is.), Nathan F. Spielvogel has not
achieved his patriotic desire “that Young
Australia should have metrical recitations
on subjects that would appeal to their love
of their homeland.” For his verses are
good verses, but bad recitations. Most
good verses are. Spielvogel is more patri-
otic than poetic; but Australia needs bar-
racked more than she needs bards. His
work is slight, but pleasant; and occasion-
ally, as in “The Call >of the Wandering
Jew” and “The Golden Days of Ballarat,”
he puts on wings. Note the swing of this
stanza from the latter poem:—
Then swift to work with pick and spade,
Ye must he men in this hold brigade,
Ye must he men if ye would raid
The flowers that hloom on Ballarat.
Ten thousand hees on the honeycomb ground,
Seeking the honey in shaft and mound.
Richest of honey that ever was found!
IIo! Ho! for the honey of Ballarat.
Usually, however, he prefers to saunter
along pleasant highways or loiter in the
eucalyptus shade. He has much facility,
some imagination and a fine fervor for Aus-
tralia. This little book is welcome.
George Moore
Salve, the second volume, of Qeorge Moore's
trilogy, Hail and Farewell (Heinemann, per
Lockley Library, Sydney), continues his
account of his connection with the Irish lit-
erary movement. It begins with his return
to Ireland in consequence of a ghostly com-
mand, and concludes with his renunciation
of Roman Catholicism and his reception into
the Protestant Church. Both are matters of
tremendous importance to George Moore. In
between there are alarums and excursions of
his soul. , When, in response to the super-
natural voice in London he went to Ireland,
to his amazement he found that Ireland did
not particularly want him. All he hoped for
was “a welcome and some enthusiasm; no
bonfires, torchlight processions, banners;
bands, Cead mille failte’s, nothing of the
kind, only a welcome.” He admits that he
was modest, considering the sacrifice he was
making. But when he pompously took a
contribution to a Nationalist paper he was
told that his article would be “considered.”
Moore was rightly shocked.
But M provided compensations, for he took
Moore off to call upon the ancient Irish
gods. JE knew the addresses of these gods—
they mostly lived in caves or on mountain
tops; but when these devout tourists
called, the gods were always out. Moore
failed eatirely to see any of them, though he
has a suspicion that managed to get into
partial communication with them. This
critic suspects that Ail's converse with the
gods was just about as complete as that of
the average Sydney telephone subscriber
when he raises his exchange and is blithely
told “all lines to Mosman engaged.” Ap-
parently M found all lines to Irish gods
engaged. For this annoying interruption of
the divine telephone service Moore blames
two Wowsers whom they met in the neigh-
borhood of the shrines. But the real reason
of their failure is plain, though unguessed
at by Moore. These two devout
pilgrims actually rode to the haunts of Irish
divinity on bicycles! No Irish god could
stand cycling pilgrims. The account of this
absurd tour is gravely set down by Moore.
His egoism is not afraid of becoming ridi-
culous.
Through the book there are delightful de-
scriptions of nature, and wicked descrip-
tions of Moore’s friends. M is the only one
of these to whom Moore can fit no witty,
wounding word. But Edward Martyn is still
“dear Edward.” Incidentally, Moore dis-
covered a new cure for consumption in Ire-
land
“And what cure is that?” Edward asked,
innocently.
“Holy orders. Now, listen! I’ve in-
quired the matter out, and have succeeded
in discovering .the fact that for the last 100
years no archbishop has died from consump-
tion, nor a bishop, nor a parish priest, only
two or three out-lying curates. Therefore,
my letter to her Excellency is a serious ad-
vocacy that all Ireland should take Orders,
those who want to lead celibate lives remain-
ing or becoming Catholics, those who wish
to enter the marriage state remaining, or
discovering themselves, Protestants. In this
way, and only in this way, will her Excel-
lency be able to kill a fatal disease and rid
Ireland of religious differences.”
Then came Moore’s greatest discovery.
About one-fourth of Salve is given up to the
evolution of this discovery, and the effect
its disclosure had on all the characters “on”
in this, the second, act of “The Soul of
George Moore.” It began with the text,
“Dogma corrodes the intelligence,” and led
him to the belief that the Catholics had no
literature, that 95 p.c. of the world’s litera-
ture has been written by Protestants and
agnostics, “that Catholicism hasn’t produced
a readable book since the Reformation.” He
examines and discusses the literature of each
country in turn, and with each step in his
researches he finds further evidence in favor
of his theory.
And, suddenly, Moore sees that his great
discovery must lead him into unexplored
country. For Moore had come to Ireland
on a sacred mission to further the renais-
sance of the Irish language; and if Ireland,
being Catholic, cannot produce literature,
where, precisely, does George Moore and his
mission come in? He is overcome by the
conclusion to which his theory has driven
him. “My life,” he exclaims, “has been
sacrificed for a bubble.” But a helpful
thought comes. “I haven’t examined the
question thoroughly. I may discover some
Catholic writers.” And he departs from
“dear Edward,” “thinking how I had been
ensnared, and wondering -vyho was the
snarer.”
France and Spain he had searched with-
out finding his Catholic author. England
was Protestant all through. Scandinavia
was, of course, out of the question. Russia
—Tourguendff he reckoned an agnostic
writer, and Tolstoy, “for his lack of belief
in the Resurrection, would have been denied
Christian burial by St. Paul.” “My dear
readers,” he sighs, “it seems impossible to
discover a Catholic writer of importance in
Europe.” But there remained Germany.
Hot-foot, he seeks out a German scholar;
but he cannot help him.
“Then,” says Moore, “I’m done for. I
was led into this country in the hopes of re-
viving the language. It seemed to me that
a new language was required to enwomb a
new literature. Ireland will not forego her
superstitions for the sake of literatura.” His
main contention is that “the Catholic may
not speculate ; and the greatest literature has
come out of speculation on the value of life.”
His brother, a Catholic, champions New-
man, whereupon George subjects Newman’s
Apologia to a detailed criticism. He finds
fault with Newman’s style; and “it is the
mind that produces the style.” And Moore’s
brother remarks, “It is barely credible....
I could write as well as that myself. .. .
What surprises me is the lack of distinc-
tion.”
His quarrel with his brother over Cathol-
icism and his indictment of their schooldays
in a Catholic school are done with a masterly
hand —the picture of that school will not
soon fade from the reader’s mind. Moore
decides that he must declare himself a Pro-
testant, for his soul’s sake, but such a step
would so grieve his brother that Moore de-
termines to leave Ireland. But the impulse
publicly to state his position persists; and
Moore decides to read the Bible through.
He approached the Bible in a twofold spirit:
“As a man of letters, and as one interested
in religious problems.” His criticism of the
Bible is cheerfully and wittily shocking—
Moore is not to be recommended to the re-
ligiously minded. The closing pages of Salve
tell of the struggles of Moore’s soul to accept
all the demands of Protestantism, but ulti-
mately he is convinced. But it was touch
and go. For Moore wrote to the Archbishop
stating his desire to be received in the Angli-
can Church, and his Grace referred him to
Moore’s parish priest! It seemed to Moore
that such a conversion as his could only be
managed by headquarters. For Moore leaves
his readers no doubt but that the soul of
George Moore is the one important fact in
this chaotic universe. And it is, and rightly
should be —to George Moore. His delightful
egoism presumes that his reader has the
same tremendous conviction. The climax of
this great spiritual adventure is “to be con-
tinued in our next,” for Vale, the conclud-
ing volume of the trilogy, is announced to
be in preparation. The suspense is terrible.
Kinetic and Potential Speech
In his Portraits and Speculations (Mac-
millan, per Dymock’s Library, Sydney),
Arthur Ransome puts forward his theory
of the differing value of words, according to
their potential or their kinetic energy, as an
infallible standard for the criticism of
poetry. Kinetic energy is force actually ex-
erted, potential energy is force that a body
is in a position to exert. Ransome applies
these terms to language, and defines the
medium of literature —words —as, a combina-
tion of kinetic with potential speech. Purely
potential speech may be found in music, or in
listening to a poem in a language that one
does not understand. Ransome takes Blake’s
“Tiger! Tiger! burning bright” as an ex-
ample. “The kinetic base of that stanza is
only the proposition to a supposed tiger of a
difficult problem in metaphysics.” (“What
immortal hand or eye could frame thy fear-
ful symmetry?”) But above, below and on
either side of that question, completely en-
veloping it, is the phosphorescence of another
speech, that we cannot so easily overhear.”
Kinetic speech may be translated without
loss from one language, to. another. Poten-
tial speech cannot. This is the reason why
Shelley denied the possibility of the transla-
tion of poetry. Why is it, then, that there
are poems that many men cannot perceive to
be poetry, and other poems, once poetry, now
no longer so? Applying Ransome’s formula,
we find that the nearer poetry approaches to
kinetic speech, the more easily is it appre-
hended by the multitude. Kinetic speech
secures its effects by the bare presentation of
facts, situations and stories, hence the wide
popularity of Longfellow, Scott and
Macaulay. Whenever poetry of high poten-
tiality is widely read it will be found that its
potential speech is condoned for its large
public, or hidden from it, by more than usu-
ally vigorous kinetic speech.
“The kinetic speech of a poem is under-
stood by all; the potential depends for its
apprehension upon the taste and the know-
ledge of the reader. Words must have for us
the associations that they had for the poet.
In time these things change. Unpopular
poetrv becomes quite popular, and, indeed,
no longer poetry, as it loses, through usage or
forgetfulness, its proximity to the condition
of potential speech The Elizabethan dra-
matists lost their potential, and were judged
only by their kinetic, speech during the 18th
century. They were considered coarse and
bloodv-minded, because there is rapine and
murder in their plays. Lamb restored to
them the potentiality they had lost.”
So we come to an understanding of the
Symbolists. They sought to write poetry
that should be purely potential; and Ran-
some points out that in the .revision of cer-
tain of his poems MallarmS tried to elimi-
nate. bit by bit, the whole structure of kinetic
speech that had been in them. But either
potential or kinetic speech carried to the
extreme cannot be poetry—it is either un-
intelligibility or bad prose.

Chesterton has discovered, in The Vic-
torian Age in Literature (Home University
Library). that the novel is the female of its
species*. “This is the first fact about the
novel, fhat it is the introduction of a new
and rather curious kind of art; and it has
been found to be peculiarly feminine, from
the first good novel by Fanny Burney to the
last good novel by Miss May Sinclair. The
truth is that the modern novel is a. new
thing; not new in its essence, but new in the
sense that it lets loose many of the things
that are old. It is a hearty and exhaustive
overhauling of that part of human existence
which has always been woman’s province, or
rather kingdom; the play of personalities in
private, the real difference between Tommy
and Joe People put the matter wrong
when they say that the novel is a study of
human nature. Human nature is a thing
that even men can understand. Human
nature is born of the pain of a woman;
human nature plays at peep-bo when it is two
and at cricket when it is 12; human nature
earns its living, and desires the other sex,
and dies. What the novel deals with is
what women have to deal with ; the differen-
tiations, the twists and turns of this eternal
river.... The novel of the nineteenth cen-
tury was female; as fully as the novel of
the* 18th century was male.”
The Man Who Got Thinking
The Royal Road, by Alfred Ollivant
(Methuen, per Dymock’s Library), is good,
sustaining food. It is the story of the life
death and resurrection of Teddy Hankey'
of London.
“Teddy Hankey was the new sort of
working-man—a product of the towns and
twentieth century. He was not burly •
he was not beery ; and he was not slow of
mind or body. There was nothing about
him of the navvy. His strength lay in his
hands and not in his arms and back and
legs. In his life he had never swung a
pick or sledge ; never driven a spade home;
never clung to the jolting plough as it
sheered its shining way through seas of rich
red tilth. His working clothes were not
earth-soilea and russet-hued—he was too far
from the old brown mother to know kiss of
hers; nor was he ever gartered beneath the
knee. Corduroys were unknown to him;
his working duds had once been his Sunday
suit. This working-man was not the machine
that wrings its riches from the earth as his
forebears had been ; he was the man behind
the machine. In Europe and America
there were hundreds of thousands of him.
.... Anybody less akin to the John Bull of
history and tradition it would be hard to
conceive. Beef and beer had not gone to
his making. He was compact of jam, fried
fish and peppermint.... Cocky and courage-
ous, he was a bounder of the class that can
bound without offence, because it is so
clearly their nature so to do.”
And, with quiet art, Ollivant shows
us Teddy from birth to death —and
after; and the simple story is one
that is full of pathos. Teddy Hankey is
well paid as a skilled hand at a splitting
machine in a tannery. He meets his girl,
marries, has a child —all cheerfully and
cockily. But then something happened in
his heart. His little girl goes to school.
“He dimly felt that he had lost something,
that a new element was stealing upon Pis
life; and that things would never be again
quite what they had been.” Teddy, like
his Cockney class, was cursed with an im-
agination. * He began to have a dim com-
prehension of the industrial system which
had produced him, and which would just
as casually throw him away. He discov-
ered that with his responsibility to his wife
and child he could not afford a breakdown
in health. The abyss yawped. ”A man of
the same mind in a strohger body would
have read, worked and -wriggled out of the
ranks of those who live by their hands into
the ranks of those who live by their brains.
As it was, when he came home of evenings
from the factory after his 13 hours in the
stench of raw hides, he had no energy to
spare for books and study. What little was
left in him went to Meg. and her amuse-
ment.”
His wife would watch him anxiously as
he sat in silence, musing
“ ‘What is it, Dad?’
“His answer never varied. It was ‘I got
thinking.’
“It was not peculiar to him, that trouble.
It was common to the workers all the w T orld
over. They got thinking.”
“Something had crept insidiously between
the workers and the old Brown Mother from
whom they sprang, to whom they belonged,
and who belonged to them of natural right
something invisible, intangible, yet very
strong and deadly. Swiney (a Socialist
friend) spoke of it as Capital.”
“That slow unveiling of his economic eyes
w T hich conies to-day to every intelligent
worker, when the first flash of youth has died
away, and he begins to feel the w T eight of the
yoke upon bis neck, seeing life no longer as
a game, but as a grim reality, was coming
to Teddy Hankey....He began to realise
that he was not a free man walking the
earth and rejoicing in his liberty; but a tiny
cog in an immense machine without a heart
over which he had no control, and in the pro-
fits of whose labors he hardly shared; and
that if he ceased to run easily and well, tne
Engineer with the Grimy Fingers would re-
move him from his bearings and chuck mm
on the scrapheap. That sense had come to
Teddy Hankey which comes increasingly to
millions in our day—the sense that he did
not belong. He felt himself a foreigner on
earth.”
So pitilesslv the inevitable tragedy rolls to
its terrible close. The author has no briet
for the workingman; he merely shows witn
out bias the working of the soulless system.
Indeed, when Teddy loses his job for a ton-
night owing to incipient tuberculosis. UUi-
vant is careful to point out the difficulty his
employer has in taking him back. *° ,
place has been filled by an even more skilled
worker, and one equally in danger of droi
ping back to the abyss.
The cog in the wheel, owing to a flaw m
its construction, gets to its appointed P
on the scrapheap, and Teddy tries to d
himself and his child. He is , sa^®( | 0 f
great-hearted slum doctor, and, dying
tuberculosis, loses his bitterness. learns aga n
to love his wife and child, and ends m »
heart-wringing mood of acceptance o
defeat. This is the “resurrection of ,led«s’
Hankey. and it is depicted with rare artist y
The book convinces.

Made by Mr. J. Pepe in competition on Oct. 19,

Remington- UMC .22 Long Rifle Lesmok Cartridges.
Authorities pronounce Mr. Pepe’s target the best and most
centrally placed 10-shot group at 100 yards ever made.
Every shot can be touched by an English shilling laid over
the group and the shots average but a quarter of an inch
from the exact center of the bull’s eye.
Mr. Pepe had already fired 9,000 RentlngtorkUMC cart-

Morning in Arcady.
mu’ were all the juices of the air
-that splashed in heavy drops against the
world,
The while Aminta sat amid her hair,
Her every rebel tress with purple curled.
et was the milkman on his morning round,
Hut wetter the dank wight whose wavering
key _
No hole in all the painted portal found
lo ope the lock of domesticity.
Four dripping panels shut him from his
home,
nd £ oiled the malten courage that he bore;
And he, alack, too full for sound or foam,
Swayed as the night tide on a windless
shore.
i The d °or swung back, Aminta’s splendid
I eyes
Hazed on the ruin thirsty night had made.
She stooped as one who snatches some rich
prize
From odorous sadness of a garbage glade.
No hint of wrath she spake, nor any sigh
Escaped the scarlet word-way of her lips.
She smote him not, nor asked the how or
why
Of morning’s ruin and his thought’s eclipse.
But gracious liquid in a shining bowl
She poured for him with tender, loving zeal —
The wounded portions of his draggled soul
I hat blended nectar oft had power to heal.
She peeled him of his dripping raiment
drear,
| Rubbed dry the oozing wildness of his head,
j Soothed his uneasy murmurs, made him
cheer,
And tucked him softlv in a grateful bed.
For thus the pleasant dames of ancient days
Were wont to hold their heroes’ hearts in
fee
Through all the tangled paths and twisted
ways
When life was young and wet in Arcady.
Oh, damp were all the juices of the air,
lhe world was moist without and eke
within.
While bright Aminta ’mid her shining hair
Heard music in the stumbling feet ~f sin.

MARY McCOMMONWEALTH.
Fable of Nature and the Maiden.
A Maiden, rapturous and intense,
Grown conscious of her Innocence,
Strolled in a Meadow one glad Day,
And watched swart Yokels making Hay.
The Air was Wine, the Sky was blue,
Nature luxurious chuckled through
The breeding Earth —a Thing, you'll note,
To flutter any Petticoat.
A Lark sang Praises overhead,
And cried that grim Despair was dead
A brood of Linnets in the Hedge
Twittered, and gave a perfect Edge
To that Keen Moment of Delight
To heighten joyous Appetite.
A Curate, passing down the Lane,
Flicked at the Daisies with his Cane,
Then paused beside the Gate to mark
The Rustics, while the 'quiring Lark
Paused not, but beat against the Sky,
Exultant in his Minstrelsy.
The Curate sensed these things, maybe,
And turned with heightened Pulse to see
The Maiden rapturous and intense,
Just conscious of her Innocence.
Dame Nature laughed. Perhaps she knew
(Being so old) a Thing or two.
She laughed to see the 'wakened Maid
So radiantly half-afraid.
She laughed to feel the thrilling Flood
Of Summer’s Glory in her BLod.
(Nature, however old she be,
Loves stinging Joy like you and me.)
The Curate sighed with sudden Spite....
His Heart so full, his Purse so light!
He’d woo the Maid (he told himself)
Had he fit Furnishing of Pelf.
She eyed him shyly as she stood,
A winsome Bit of Womanhood.
Ah, how the Sky was blue, so blue!. .. .
Ah, how the Lark was pleading, too !
The Curate sought his _ humble Home,
And bent above a musty Tome.
So cramped the stony Path he trod,
He dared not grasp that Fruit of God,
Nor dream (for very Prudence’ sake)
Of tender Damsels just awake.
Though all his Manhood irked by Drouth
Yearned for the Glamor of .-her Mouth,
The wistful Wonder in her Eyes
Just opening to Paradise.
The Maiden, tremulous with Glow
Of this new Music, turned to go,
And in her Father’s Garden met
An old Man, very staid and set.
(Vile Gold had he in plenty, and
He owned a mighty Stretch of Land.)
Long had he wooed her all in vain,
And now he pressed his Suit again.
The Maiden’s sweet Lips fell apart,
While in her strangely fluttering Heart
The Magic of the. Summer grew.
(Domed Heaven was a singing blue.)
He wooed, and she could not resist,
But let her shy. sweet Mouth be kissed ;
And so, to end this futile Strife,
She told him she would be his Wife.
She robed in Spring, he for his Shroud
Preparing. Nature laughed aloud
With strident Laughter clear and dry.
The Lark was sobbing in the Sky.
Moral (for shallow Striplings who
Deem that all Fables are untrue) :
If you’d succeed in Love, be sure it
Is foolish to become a Curate;
But still, however well you waltz,
Dame Nature oft will fl"v you false.
So, when you woo vour destined Maid,
If surely you would snare the Jade,
(Though this your simple Faith may shock),
it
Is best to have a well-lined Pocket.

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears* Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
skin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre*
eminent decree as

A MEMORY.
At a special meeting of the executive of the Freetrade and Land Values League it was unanimously decided that the secretary should write to all Federal candidates for New
South Wales, requesting an answer to the following questions:-
1. Are you in favor of reducing the cost of living by abolishing Customs and Excise taxes now imposed upon food, clothing, raw materials and tools of industry?
2. In e vent of the tariff being re-opened, will you vote consistently to enlarge the free list, and, if that fails, in any case tor the lowest proposed tax?

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there ; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read, and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the form
of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse, Short
Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Australian sub-
jects, and not exceeding two columns in length, or,
say, 3000 words, are specially acceptable), Paragraphs,

THE WHOLE GOSPEL OF
CONGESTION.
There dropped into Sydney recently a cer-
tain Haggard —front name Rider, and a
man of some tonnage in his own country—
who warned this community to “people the
land” instead of devoting itself too exclus-
ively to the heaping up of one big, bloated
city in each State. Thereupon the big Tory
papers of the big congested cities spoke
kindly of Haggard, whose front name is
Rider ; and declared that his words were the
utterance of wisdom, which, seeing that the
Drophet who spoke them was imported from
Freetrade England, could hardly be other-
wise from the Tory standpoint. That is to
say, these papers backed up the imported
prophet in a general way, but as their own
interests lie with the congested cities they
mostly hastened to add that the protests
against the congestion policy might be over-
done, and that it wasn’t advisable to carry
zeal to excess, and that haste might be exag-
gerated, and reform might lead to undigni-
fied perspiration, and it was always advis-
able to take all the circumstances of the case
into consideration. As the Sydney Tele-
graph put it: —•
To apply to the relative proportions of country
and city populations judgments based upon standards
of . earlier times would be misleading. If nations
which depended mainly on trade were for that reason
on the road to decaj 7 , what would be Britain’s state?
We real se—no one can help realising—that to the
healthy progress of Australia the development of her
back-country is vitally necessary. But there has
been too much talk about the disproportionate
growth of Australian cities, and especially of Syd-
ney. Cities simply focus the country about them;
what they are it has made them, and thej’ are as
necessary to it as it to them.
These are non-committal words, and they ex-
press in a general way the attitude of the
Tory city press. For the larger the propor-
tion of the population of N.S.W. or Victoria
that is compressed into Sydney and Mel-
bourne the larger is the handy and easily
available clientele of the established Sydney
and Melbourne papers, and the greater their
profits. And if every attempt to establish big
cities that are not Sydney or Melbourne is
heavily sat upon in the Congestion interest,
the less risk these papers have of serious
opposition. In other words, they hold, by
reason of the Congestion policy, a most re-
markable sort of monopoly, and they advo-
cate the policy which has made that mono-
poly. Consequently it is not advisable to
regard them as wholly unbiassed witnesses.
Sometimes there is almost a temptation to
regard some of them as unprincipled liars.
* * * *
The Congestion policy of three Australian
States has no existing precedent on the face
of the earth. There have been city States
like Carthage and Venice and Florence and
the final tail end of the Greek Empire which
consisted, at one time or another, almost en-
tirely of a huge metropolis and a back yard,
but they are dead. It is natural that they
should be dead. Taking the unhealthy case
of Sydney, it is estimated that, during the
year 1912, the population of N.S.W. in-
creased by 80,230 persons, and that 43,000
of this increase Avent into Sydney and its
suburbs (about 150 square miles), which left
37,230 people as the new population gained
by the other 310,200 square miles which
make up the State. Yet it is the boast of
such Congestion papers as the Sydney Tele-
graph and Herald that Australia is, and
should be for many years to come, essentially
a land of primary industries —that it should
depend on wheat-raising and meat- and wool-
growing, and mining, and other country jobs.
And the Protectionists, who don’t believe in
the importing policy of the Telegraph and
similar Foreign-trade rags, are addicted to
remarking —theoretically—that even though
a State should make its own boots and hats
and engines, there is no reason why these
essential industries should be all crowded on
to one spot, and the raw material which they
require carried absurd and useless distances
at great cost to that spot, and the finished
product be similarly dragged at needless ex-
pense away from that spot, and the artisan
be driven to pay twice the rent he ought to
pay by reason of the policy which crowds all
of him on to the smallest possible space or
spot, and leaves the rest of the. country
empty. Yet, despite all the professions of a
deep desire to fill up the vacant spaces almost
everybody seems to be toiling with might and
main in the Congestion interest.
It is a startling fact that, despite all the
vast borrowing that has been done, all the
railway building, all the land legislation and
all the alleged opening up of the country,
Sydney stands, at each succeeding census,
for a larger and larger proportion of the
N.S.W. population. If the movement con-
tinues at the present rate a time must come
when there will be practically nothing in the
great Cornstalk country except Sydney. On
paper that city doesn’t stand for quite such
a large percentage of the local community
as Melbourne or Adelaide does, but in reality
its case is the worst of the three. In its line
there is nothing else like it on earth. If the
area that is called Greater Sydney covered
as many square miles as Greater Melbourne
or Greater Adelaide it would represent not
less than half the population of the State.
Already it embodies 2i times the land values
of all the other municipalities put together.
It contains most of the private wealth of the
State, all deposited conveniently on the sea
shore where the first foreign enemy may get
at it on the first day of his arrival. There
isn’t a N.S.W. bank or a life or fire or other
insurance concern, or a trustee company, or
a newspaper possessed of any serious influ-
ence, that isn’t located there. There are very
few business firms of importance outside the
big city, and with the possible exception of
Newcastle there is hardly a port outside it
whose foreign trade isn’t perishing—or
already perished. There is practically no ex-
pansion of manufactures except in Sydney,
and that city possesses to-day about three-
fourths of the manufactures of the State. In
fact, it would be only necessary for an enemy
to take possession of this accessible and ill-
defended fragment of ground, and in one day
the boasted Ma province would get back
almost to the aboriginal or fried ’possum
stage of existence. It would have its rail-
way communications cut in practically every
direction. It would lose all its machinery of
government and almost all its manufactures
and its commercial facilities, its cash, its
credit and its defensive system. After that
it wouldn’t be so very much further advanced
than it was in Cook’s day —in fact, for pur-
poses of defence it would be further behind.
The attack would be stronger and the resist-
ance, by reason of the insufficiency of ’pos-
sum, would shoAV no corresponding improve-
ment. Now that Sydney has become such a
gigantic monopoly that it absorbs more than
half the new population—and unless the
movement is checked it will probably soon
absorb the whole of it and perhaps even more
-—the situation becomes full of possibilities.
When this question is raised the Tory city
papers which make stupendous fortunes out
of the Congestion device invariably reply that
the matter can’t be helped. The position
hasn’t been artificially created but has arisen
naturally. Providence did it, in fact. It is
one of the inevitable concomitants of our
complex modern civilisation —and so on. Just
here it may naturally be asked why the same
sort of disease hasn’t arisen naturally in any
other country, and why it isn’t the natural
concomitant of civilisation anywhere save in
N.S.W., Victoria and S.A. England, for in-
stance, is 300 times as thickly peopled as
Australia, and it is natural that a vastly lar-
ger proportion of its people should be dri\ 7 en
to live by town industries than is the case
here; yet it hasn’t one and only one big city
and trade centre, and its bloated metropolis
represents a very much smaller proportion of
the total inhabitants than either Sydney,
Melbourne or Adelaide. The same statement
applies to every other European or American
State. It also applies to every Australasian
State —Westralia, Tasmania, Queensland
and Maoriland —which hasn’t deliberately
laid itself out to concentrate everything in one
exaggerated capital, and devised its railway
system with that end in view, regardless of
the huge loss inflicted on the people by need-
less distances and needless haulage. Unless
it can be proved that N.S.W., for instance,
owns a special kind of civilisation that is like
nothing to be found except in a small corner
of Australia; or that 400 miles in N.S.W. is
really less than 100 miles, so that long haul-
age is cheaper than short; or that such ports
as Port Stephens and Twofold Bjiy don’t,
and never did, exist; or that all the coast of
the State, apart from Sydney, is disease-
smitten, leprous, accursed and uninhabitable
—-unless one or more of these things can be
proved the proposition that the One Big City
policy is the natural outcome of the country’s
conditions is silly and childish lying. As a
matter of obvious fact, the commerce which
might have been at Port Stephens or Two-
fold Bay, because these were the handiest
outlets for the adjacent districts, was artifi-
cially killed just as was the commerce of
Antwerp when the Dutch closed the river
against shipping, or the trade of Carthage
when the Romans obliterated the place. In
proof of which let anyone send a ship to Port
Stephens, and try to get the Railway De-
partment to take a cargo of wool to that ship
by the line which doesn’t exist —there is a
new line close at hand, but it takes an ela-
borate and costly circuit to avoid about the
best port in the State —and ask that Depart-
ment to load the vessel by means of the ab-
sent crane on the non-existent wharf. And
if he can find any disability about the place
save the careful and elaborate disqualifica-
tion which prevents the railway and the crane
and the wharf he should inform the Con-
gestion press of the fact and gladden its heart
accordingly.
The case against Congestion is, briefly,
that it retards settlement by creating a vast,
costly artificial remoteness between many of
the fertile areas of the State and the only
permissible outlet for their surplus products ;
that it leads to unhealthy overcrowding; also
that it is a most dangerous policy of putting
all the public eggs into one basket. The case
for it is that it is an old and habitual crime ,
that it protects a few loud-mouthed and
shameless Tory publications from serious
competition ; that it is good for the private
landlords of Sydney, of whom the State Pre-
mier is one; and that it saves a lazy, effete,
discredited, politically rotten and politically
unscrupulous Cabinet the trouble of living
up to its alleged principle of State land
ownership. And there or thereabouts the
whole story of Congestion begins and ends.
THE N.S.W. MINISTRY—SO FAR AS
IT HAS GOT.
Now that nine months of N.S.W.’s current
financial year have drifted by, some people
here and there begin to ask the famous Mad
Ministry where it thinks it. is going. So
far as things have travelled the ordinary
revenue has improved by £348,905, as com-
pared with the corresnonding period of last
financial year, which means that the income
has been growing at the rate of £465,200
per annum. Even if that was a lonesome
and solitary increase it should help materi-
ally to keep the State out of the ditch. But
it isn’t lonesome or solitary. It is part of a
boom movement which has gone on without
interruption since 1903. But it unfortu-
nately happens that the bottomless pit of
the McGowen Cabinet seems capable of
swallowing up all increases, and leaving
very little that is tangible or permanent or
reproductive to show for them—for such
things as its friend Nielsen’s famous trav-
elling job with £4 per day for “expenses”
can hardly be called either permanent or
reproductive. The ordinary expenditure for
the nine months has expanded enor-
mously as compared with the corres-
ponding period of last year, and
already the outgoings are over £2,100,000
ahead of the receipts. So far, N.S.W.
is shaping well for a shortage of
£2,500,000 on the year—the most prosperous
year in the matter of revenue that the State
has seen or heard of up to date. And what
the Mad Ministry proposes to do about it
that mad institution doesn’t even mention.
In fact, it never touches the subject except
in the most general way, and it alludes to
eight or ten millions more or less as if they
were a matter of no real importance.
The McGowen Cabinet has been men-
tioned in a charitable sort of way as the
Mad Ministry, but in reality the Scab Min-
istry might be a more fitting term. A scab
is understood to be one who goes back on
sound labor principles, and on this basis no
blackleg who has been kicked out of a
union, no cheap laborer, no sweater’s em-
ployee or strike-breaker has “scabbed” more
strenuously than McGowen, Holman and
co. They attained office on certain recog-
nised conditions, and unless they were politi-
cal traitors and Parliamentary liars they
were bound by these conditions. One of
them was a pledge that, for the future, loan
money would be expended less recklessly
than in the past, and only laid out on works
that would pay full interest on their cost
and a small sum—l per cent, was men-
tioned —towards a sinking fund. The prom-
ised economy of loan funds is missing. The
Government has joyously “blewed” about
£6,500,000 of borrowed money in nine
months, which means that it is pawning
posterity at the rate of about £8,600,000 per
annum. In the old bad days of Tory boom
and Tory extravagance, the very worst year
N.S.W. ever had showed a loan expenditure
of something under £5.000,000. And even
Toryism—not being then edrrupted by
McGowen and his dreadful friends—
was shocked to some extent at its
own doings, and repented more or
less, and so far cut down the lOU
that in one remarkable year that document
amounted to only a little over £1.000,000.
The charge against the present shameless
and backsliding combination is that it got
into power with a promise to reduce borrow-
ing, and it has much more than doubled
borrowing. It went back on its solemn
league and covenant almost on the day it
got into its billet, and every succeeding day
it went back on it more and more. It is
customary to complain of the falsehoods
that the capitalistic press tells about Lahnr
but in this matter the falsehoods &
allied Labor, as represented by McGowp*
the landlord, and Holman, the
told about itself would be hard to equal’ \l
toi the assuiance that loan funds
only to be expended on works that won a
pay full interest and sinking f um i it
been so utterly thrown overboard that the
sinking fund is hardly even mentioned now,
days—in fact, the amount out of
revenue in reduction of debt appears to he
less now than it was last year; and the
►State s so-called “permanent and renrod ~
tive works” are yielding less net revenue
than they did 12 months ago. If this whole-
sale and retail repudiation of the I abm-
programme doesn’t qualify McGowen" and
co. to be described as the Great Scab
Cabinet (or Scabinet) the party’s vocahn
lary is in need of revision.
* * * *
There was a time when N.S.W. almost
swore off the evil practice of floating loans
in London, and selling its children into finan-
cial slavery to the foreign capitalist, just
as the Circassian used to sell his daughters
to the foreign Turk. It will be remembered
to the discredit of the McGowen Govern-
ment that it undid this comparatively good
deed, and resumed the old practice of beg-
ging from Bull-Colien of England. Also
it has run down the credit of the State till
the price of Bull-Cohen’s aid to his mendi-
cant offspring has risen to a figure unknown
for very many years past. Yet despite all
the loans that have been floated, loan
expenditure, like ordinary expenditure, his
kept ahead of receipts, and in order to fill
the. gap the Treasurer has done marvels in
the way of laying his hands on trust funds,
savings bank deposits, small balances belong-
ing to lunatics, and such-like trifles. Even
the penny of the blind beggar would hardly
be beneath his consideration. In fact, after
all the formal borrowings (over £6,000,000
in nine months) there still remains more
than £4,650,000 due on small casual promis-
sory notes, and when they are allowed for
there is mighty little trust money that
James McGowen hasn’t got his hands upon.
Also, all the funds that the Commonwealth
had to spare in a temporary sort of way
out of the Federal bank-note fund have been
gladly accepted, and recently Australia saw
the remarkable spectacle of the Queensland
Government offering its allegedly big and
affluent relative a trifle of “monish” to
go on with —of course at a price. A whole
lot of remarkable and humorous things hap-
pen in N.S.W. these days.
The alternatives ahead of the State are
bitter poverty and hard retrenchment, or
else public insolvency. No State can go on
spending more every year with nothing
tangible to show for it, and having a bigger
deficit every year, and borrowing on a larger
scale every year, and borrowing at higher
interest every year, without some kind of
stoppage resulting. Apparently the shiftless
and hopeless Premier has realised something
of this sort at last, and he has proposed to
flee from the wrath to come. In other
words, he threatens to quit his political job
and retire before the smash and the great
discredit. He isn’t really an old man. for
his 60th year is still some distance ahead,
but he is a supreme failure, and it is not
good for any failure to wait until the public
bas a chance to tell him frankly what it
thinks of him. Some people may not greatly
admire the courage of the captain who
leaves the sinking ship, but everybody must
recognise his prudence. McGowen, during
his brief term of office, has given his followers
and admirers a good time with money raised
regardless of consequences. If he leaves
now he can say that things were good while
he was in charge, and he can blame his suc-
cessor for the consequences. Anybody who
is swift enough on his feet can be an ab-
sconding political debtor. The job of leav-
ing posterity to pay the bill, and not being
there when the bill arrives- is within the
scope of any fleet-footed character. Such
places as South America are pervaded by
people who left before the bill arrived. If
James McGowen retires between now and
election day he will at least get a fairly good
send-off from the Tory press. In his main-
tenance of the Congestion policy; in his
refusal to create State-owned cities at the
neglected ports of N.S.W.: in his reverence
for the interests of the Sydney landlords; in
his clamor for a mean and hopeless Federal
capital; in his narrowness and parochialism;
in his borrowing and booming—in all these
things he has been a Premier after its own
heart. So it will write a pleasant but
guarded epitaph above his political dust.
And then the people whom he fooled will be
left to consider how 7 to clear off the dead
horse which he didn’t take away with him
in his retreat.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Greece and its Marine Jest.
It has been the fashion with a certain un-
patriotic gang of politicians and human sun-
dries to heap a crude variety of scorn on tne
small beginnings of Australian naval defence.
To these people the fact that the Australian
fleet won’t be born full-grown —as it any-
thing was ever born full-grown —has been
advanced as a reason why it shouldn t fie
born at all. In its early stages it will be
quite unfit to face single-handed the navy or
a Great Power, or even of something less than
a Great Power, and this fact is advanced as
sufficient cause for derision. True, the first
English navy was quite unfit, for many years,
to face the fleets of Norway or the Greek
empire, and even in Plantagenet times Eng-
land was glad to hire marine aid from v emce.
And there are people still living who remem-
ber when the German navy was so small anu
futile that Denmark blockaded the German
coast, and a British Prime Minister
at the German salt-water banner as a P 1
flag.” Therefore there are precedents to
Australian’s small beginnings as a sea M° w
—so many precedents that only the mo
thick-headed of critics can be oblivious
them. x\.nd within the last few months hi -
tory has been busy supplying further mi ■
trations of the case, and showing that e\
a baby fleet may be a matter of infinite i
portance. When the four Confederate
with 10,000.000 people among them, took tne
chance of war with the Unspeakable 1
and his population of 24,000,000 they b .
wanted ships, and only Greece had any
of a sea armament. Greece is a very, ' •
small country, and very barren, and natui. .
very poor. It isn’t a patch even on -


tralia for population, and is not within a
hundred centuries of it for wealth. And the
necessity for keeping up a disproportionately
large army as a safeguard against the Otto-
man had further helped to starve its naval
force. Still Demetrius Piiriedfisii got his
infant squadron to sea in haste, and Abdul
Ballast and Abdul Bilgewater did the
same with the Ottoman navy. The two
sized each other up, and then Abdul Bal-
last and Abdul Bilgewater found it was
time to run for shelter. The Greek fleet
might be, according to the doctrines of the
Australian anti-Defence party, a jest which
had no business to be loose on the waters
without its mother to look after it, but it
was the better jest of the two, and Deme-
trius at the guns showed every resolve to
make the best of whatever chance he had. His
outfit might be only worth 2d., but then its
enemy was only worth lid., and that odd Id.
made all the difference. In the circumstances
the Greek fleet served its purpose just as well
as 20 Dreadnoughts would have done. With
two more good ships the Turks might have
driven Greek commerce off the sea, spoiled
all the Greek schemes for annexing Turkish
islands, and perhaps kept 50,000 Greek sol-
diers at home doing garrison duty in sea port
towns. As matters stood it was Turkish
commerce that was bumped hard on the seas.
Incidentally, whenever the Greeks had a
minute to spare they captured another Turk-
ish island, helped themselves to whatever
arms and ammunition the little garrison pos-
sessed, diverted the local taxes into their
hungry treasury, and gathered recruits among
the wildly applauding inhabitants, and while
they did this the disgruntled Mohammedans
could do very little save look on. By reason
of a few very inferior ships the whole Greek
army was able to go to the front, for even
the comic opera fleet could keep the peace on
the Greek coast against the variety show
fleet of the Turk. The same humble disar-
rangement of ships was able to assist at
bottling up for a time a huge Turkish army
on the Gallipoli peninsula, where the alleged
Caliph’s soldiery became steadily wetter,
colder, hungrier, more dispirited and less
useful. When it was necessary to rush Ser-
vian reinforcements to the front in haste it
was the Greek naval attitude which made
the short sea-route practicable, and incident-
ally it is mentioned that it was the Servians
and their guns which were the last straw on
the back of the Turkish camel at Adrianonle,
wherefore that place surrendered the other
day with 60,000 soldiers and 640 valuable
cannon. As already mentioned, according to
the position of the Australian anti-Defence
push Greece has even less right than Aus-
tralia to have any sea-power at all, for it has
far less means of supporting anything of the
sort, and it hasn’t a hundredth part of Aus-
tralia’s chance that its navy will ever be
equal to that of a Great Power, or even of a
fairly strong secondary Power. But Deme-
trius did his best, and as it happened Pro-
vidence was good to Demetrius as it often
is to those who do their best. His force was
big enough for the job it had to do, and
it was a job on which immense. issues
depended. It saved probably twice its
value directly, and a lot more indirectly.
The record of the Balkan scrap is full of en-
couragement for those who believe in making
a good beginning with a system of national
defence, even though—the race of the pro-
phets being extinct —no one knows at the
moment exactly what the ending may be. It
is quite possible for a big city to be held up
by an iron dredge with a few guns on it if
the owners of the city hadn’t the foresight to
lay in some guns and a dredge of their own.
And then that big city feels very small and
mean, and all the world laughs at it. The
moral of which is that in defence matters
almost anything is a little better than no-
thing, and that the gods are often unexpec-
tedly good to the community which goes the
whole hog. even if it is a small community
and can’t go any great size of a hog.
Our Daily Strike.
Considering that almost everybody in and
around Sydney is, or has recently been, or
expects soon to be on strike, and that a
large section of the population of Newcastle,
Broken Hill and the Illawarra district is, or
was, or soon may be, in a similar situation,
the time appears to be ripe for some dis-
course about the case. At present the
Labor party owns the Parliament and the
Government of N.S.W. Through them it
bosses the railways, and the latest big strike
concerns the railways. Through them, also,
it controls the whole machinery of Indus-
trial Arbitration, which was devised to
make strikes unnecessary, illegal and impos-
sible, and it is on chronic strike against
Arbitration. It is also supposed to own
and control Attorney-General Holman, the
eminent Laborite who recently declared in
London that Arbitration had abolished
strikes in the land of the. Ma Community.
By reason of its ownership of Parliament
it lately rushed, or shambled, through the
State Legislature a Gas Bill of sorts, w'hich
was to put everything right in the gas indus-
try, and the gas strike which followed made
this new and allegedly perfect arrangement
sit up suddenly and look foolish. The
whole question boils down to two proposi-
tions : If unionism believes that the strike
the simple old device of industrial warfare
—is the best way of settling differences, then
it should call on its Ministry and its 1 ar-
liamentary majority to wipe all Arbitration
devices off the local statute' book; and it
should cable to Attorney-General Holman
and tell him not to be an absurd ass in
London. Then the position would be clear
and honest. On the other hand, if the
unions still believe in Industrial Arbitra-
tion, but consider that they haven t aot the
right variety of it, they should explain what
is the right variety, and see that the
Labor Government and the Labor I ai^ ia '
mentary majority supplies the toods. lhe
present situation is anomalous. The P ar ty
in power seems to be, a great part of the
time, on strike against itself and its own
methods. It rushes into industrial warfare,
apparently on the plea that it and its I ar-
raent and its Government are such darned
fools that it has to live in almost chronic
insurrection against them in order to get
its rights. It gets awards and it makes
agreements, but amid the prevailing chaos it
pays so litle attention to them that an im-
pression begins to arise that no possible
agreement is worth more than a Bengalee s
oath or a Mexican President s billet. Cer-
tainly in many of tlie recent disturbances
the strikers appear to have had a good case
—often a very good case—when their hoin,
wages and general conditions were ta ven
into account. But when Labor owns t t
Parliament and the Cabinet, and can make
and unmake the whole system of Ir mstrial
Arbitration it should be able to j ut these
matters right without running amok after
the manner of a bovine animal in a china
shop, and declaring war, not only avainst
the employers, but against the whole com-
munity, Labor supporters included. Unless
the party is prepared to announce that it
really prefers war to peace, and strikes to
arbitration, and that all its professed advo-
cacy of wages boards and such-like is gross
hypocrisy, the only possible explanation is
that the party doesn’t believe it is fit to
govern, and that it regards its Parliament
and its Ministry and its own programme
as failures. There is some reason in the
spectacle of the defeated minority resorting
to civil war. But when the victorious
majority does it, the situation is grotesque.
The almost certain downfall of the N.S.W.
State Labor Government will be largely
due to the deafening advertisement its own
supporters have supplied re its incapacity,
and their own incapacity. The unions, like
Dogberry, write themselves down an ass.
The community finds strikes a costly nuis-
ance. One reason why it put Labor in
power was that Labor might give itself com-
plete justice—all the justice it thought it
required—by peaceful means. And the com-
munity is savagely disappointed to find that
the apparently infallible remedy is a failure,
and that the unions strike a little more furi-
ously, if such a thing be possible, against
their own crowd than they did against the
other crowd.
“Constructive Statesmanship.”
Of all the Tory comment which was made on
.Toseph Cook’s exposition, last week, of the
Liberal policy for the forthcoming three
years, the most priceless, in the way of
broad humor, was certainly that of the S. M.
Hekald. With every appearance of gravity,
this irrepressible old journalistic wag said
(4/4/T3) :
There is a note of constructive statesmanship in the
policy of the Liberal leader that we look for in vain
in that of Labor.
Properly to appreciate the sardonic bitter-
ness of'the above jest, it is necessary to con-
sider Joseph’s recent effort in detail more
or less. A number of institutions are to be
“maintained” —the Federal Arbitration Court,
Old Age and Invalid Pensions, a White
Australia, Compulsory Military Service, the
Australian Navy, and sundry other things
which no office-seeker in the possession of
his faculties would dare, at this time of day,
to talk of overturning. Also, “the policy of
the present Commonwealth tariff is to be
preserved,” which is a civil way of mention-
ing that the sweated goods of the cheap-
labor nations overseas are to be suffered to
pour in on us as heretofore ; and “the States
are to be secured full independence in local
affairs,” or, in other words, all attempts from
any quarter to validate such enactments of
the old, or Deakin Liberalism, as the New
Protection, a Federal Rule, or the Aus-
tralian Industries Preservation Act, will be
resisted by the New, or Cook Liberalism, to
the ultimate gasp. None of the things which
have been, at various times, represented as
Curses, Menaces and the like, by the people
whom Cook now represents are to be at-
tacked. In fact, they are to be cherished.
And one new measure is foreshadowed. It is a
hilarious fact that in all the vast welter of
speech which Joseph poured forth on Thurs-
day night last one piece of legislative reform,
and one only, is promised. According to
Joseph :
We propose to mature along lines suggested by the
experience of other ccntries a comprehensive scheme
of national insurance, providing for sickness, acci-
dents, maternity, widowhood and unemployment on
a contributory basis.
Britain’s National Insurance Bill has been
denounced for the palpable Socialism that it
is by every consistent anti-Socialist in the
United Kingdom. But let that pass. Aus-
tralia has long ceased to expect anything re-
sembling honest anti-Socialism from the
bogus anti-Socialists of its Federal and State
Houses. Cook’s lonely proposal is open to
harsh criticism as a most fraudulent piece
of confidence trickery on other grounds.
National Insurance, on a contributory basis,
is carried out in other countries —which is
to say, in Germany and the United King-
dom —on the following lines: the employee
is forced by law to contribute a certain sum
per week to a* provident fund, for the benefit
of himself and his family : the employer must
provide a somewhat similar sum ; while the
State makes up the difference with a contri-
bution that is equal to the other two or
thereabouts. In Britain and in Germany it
is possible for the central Parliaments to
enforce such an Act. Not so here. The
High Court has declared that, by virtue of
the Trade and Commerce clause in our Con-
stitution, the Australian Parliament though
it has power to make laws in respect of trade
and commerce between the States, has no
power whatever to interfere with any con-
cern which operates within a State. To in-
dicate the distinction between the conditions
here and abroad it is enough to remark that
whereas the British Parliament is fully em-
powered to force, say, an Edinburgh hotel-
keeper and his employees to join in any form
of National Insurance that the Legislature
puts on the Statute Book, the Australian
Parliament has no more power to so inter-
fere with such a business, or with any other
business that is confined to one State, than it
has to legislate for the well-being of Russia.
To sum the matter up, Cook, in the unlikely
event of his ousting Fisher from office, may
so violate his individualistic principles as to
pass an Insurance Bill. But unless he also
gets the Federal Constitution amended by a
general Referendum of the electors, the mea-
sure will be quite futile and valueless. Now
he firmly opposes any Constitutional altera-
tion, and, most of all, one that touches the
trade and commerce clause. Which is to
say, his talk of introducing a system of
National Insurance is the rankest sort of
false pretence. The rest of Joseph’s policy
consists partly of assurances that he will do
what his opponents are already doing (the
promotion of immigration, for instance, which
has never been brisker in the history of Aus-
tralia than it is to-day), and partly of pro-
mises that he will oppose things—a raised
tariff, the strengthening of the Federal Par-
liament, with the object of validating social
reform measures, and so on. To call such
aspirations “constructive statesmanship”
well-nigh amounts to insulting language. A
politician, one-half of whose programme con-
sists of maintaining existing institutions,
while the other half consists of opposing new
ideas, isn’t a constructive person. He is a
cul de sac.
Selling Australia a Dog.
The Bulletin’s Retired Admiral writes: —
The Navy policy speech of Winston Churchill
(First Lord of the Bull Admiralty) the other night
in the House of Commons, reads very much as if
Australia had been sold a dog. Which has been
the not uncommon experience of the Commonwealth
in Quite a lot of its dealings with the dear old
Grandmother Land. In all good faith Australia has
been carrying out its naval defence policy on the
lines endorsed by the Imperial Defence Conferences
of 1909-1911, and has given patriotic proof of its
intention to move on towards providing the founda-
tion of a powerful fleet for the preservation of the
White Man in the Pacific. But, until such time as
that defence has been provided for locally, the obli-
gation was supposed to be with Britain to afford a
certain sense of security. The form of the obliga-
tion was not all that Australia could have desired ;
still, it was something. And the fact that Bjjll
has now definitely thrown it on one side is another
significant pointer to just how much is likely to
be expected* in that quarter if a war scramble is
suddenly sprung upon the Empire.
Bull undertook (or it was understood that he
did) to fit out two fleet units —one in China waters,
with Maoriland’s Dreadnought as the flagship, and
one in Indian waters. For some time past it was
evident that Bull had no intention of keeping his
share of the “honorable understanding.” While Aus-
tralia was hard at graft preparing, as a dutiful son
should, to help the old man in the direction the old
man had pointed out, the aged reprobate broke faith.
Left him, in short, to shift for himself, with the
bald unofficial intimation that things were different
now, or the time was geting ripe in Europe (nobody
seems to care how it is progressing in Asia), or
something equally vague and unsatisfactory. Now,
Winston Churchill puts the position beyond doubt.
Said he (per cable) :
“If the pressure at the decisive theatre continued
to grow it behoved the oversea Dominions to pro-
vide for their own and the common security by form-
ing local navies, or, what was more effectual, by
additions to the Imperial navy, in order to preserve
its world-wide mobility.”
Which goes to explain why Maoriland, with its
Dreadnough “addition” to the Imperial navy, and
Canada with its proposed three-Dreadnouvht “addi-
tion,” have been receiving the high spot light of
Imperial approval lately—additions to the navy are
now more favored than local units. Bull is in
fear at home. White Australasia is in fear at home,
too, but that isn’t worth mention, unless its relief
is provided for in the latest proposal of the Admir-
alty to form the Canadian Dreadnoughts (if the
gift is made), the Malay States’ Dreadnought and
Maoriland’s Dreadnought into an Imperial squadron,
based on Gibraltar. As Churchill says:—
“They would occasionally visit the Dominions to
show the flag [say, about twice a month or cen-
tury] and be ready [say, at a moment’s notice] to
operate at any danger point at Home or abroad
[say, at Australia’s open north].
No wonder Australia’s Government hustles out the
statement made by Prime Minister Fisher, on
Monday night, that rapidity of expansion is to be
shown by the Commonwealth in local naval defence.
Clearly we are on our lonesome at this end,

Defence Hint from this paper’s “Old Sol-
dier” :
The recently-fallen Adrianople—one of the two
entrenched nosit.ons which the Turks have held
throughout the war —affords an object lesson in the
value of the new kind of fortified position with a
town for its “nucleus, and a chain of detached forts,
each capable of defending itself for a time, scat-
tered at various distances round the central town
and at various intervals from one another. It is neces-
sary in these days of long-range rifled guns to keep
the besieger so far away from the centre of an en-
trenched position that he cannot bombard it with
any effect. As the range of rifled guns increases, the
forts must be moved further and further from the
nucleus town if it is to be really safe from bombard-
ment. Just now, if the besieger can place and work
his batteries within 7000 yards of the central town,
he can make himself tolerably troublesome to its
people. What he has to fear is the fire of the guns
in the forts, or in the subsidiary batteries that will
be thrown up in advance of them when the attack
begins. The besieger ought always to be able to
establish a superiority of fire and gradually advance
his batteries. He ought, if he has means and skill
enough, to be able in time to take some of the forts
one by one, but if they were well defended it would
be at heavy cost both in men and material. The
Adrianople forts were built all in earthwork, with
underground barracks and stores, in the beginning
of the war with Russia in 1877. They were too
near the town, which was thus exposed to damage
by bombardment, from which it is said to have
suffered a good deal.
The cable tells us that the Turkish gunners fired
slowly to save their ammunition, which was running
short. That is where the besieger has the advantage
every time. He can, if the road is open behind him,
renew his stock of ammunition and food, and even
bring un fresh men to make good his losses, and re-
place those who are worn out with the hard work
in the trenches, while the besieged, when they are
once surrounded, must do as they best can with what
they have, unless their friends outside can collect
force enough to break through the line of invest-
ment and bring them more supplies and fresh men.
The advantage of the defence is decisive for the
time, but if nothing of the sort is possible the de-
fenders will get weaker and weaker, while the guns
of the besiegers are knocking their earthworks out
of shape, and they are less able every day to go on
repairing the damage that the guns are doing to the
works. It is not only the fighting, but the down-
right hard and exhausting work that has to be done,
renewing smashed gun-carriages in the batteries,
bringing up new guns to replace those which have
been made unserviceable, and perforrrrng a hundred
other duties that are essential to keeping the defence
alive. The besieger is sure to win if he is not hur-
ried ; but the Bulgarians and Servians \yere hurried
—or thought so—at Adrianople. So they drove their
men on to storm the only half-ruined forts. Whole
companies and battalions are said to have been wiped
out by the fire from the forts. Perhaps Australia
will note that little fact, since it is really deter-
mined to defend itself. Why should it not make up
its mind to provide for the defence of its big sea-
ports by a ring of earthworks, far enough out to
protect them from bombardment or from a sudden
rush ? It would not really cost much. Anyhow, it
would be far cheaper than buying that big
“manoeuvre area” at Liverpool.
♦
Sydney Telegraph performed a notable feat
(2/4/’l3) in the way of compressing a
quantity of mendacity into a very small
space. Discussing Fisher’s policy speech
disclosures it said :
The New Protection is an undeveloped, unexplained
device to give a share of the tariff benefits to the
workmen and the consumer. The party now frankly
confesses that, whether it can elaborate a system
of New Protection, or not, etc., etc.
Is the New Protection “an undeveloped and
unexplained device,” and a system which has
yet to be elaborated? The untruthfulness of
such a contention is as obvious as the side of
a gaol. The New Protection is well under-
stood in Australia, and it has been carefully
explained and approved, not merely by Labor-
ites, but by the leaders of Liberalism both in
the Federal and State Parliaments. Alfred
Deakin was the author of it, and he ex-
pounded and upheld it in many an eloquent
address both in and out of Parliament. W.
H. Irvine, M.P., gave it his (dessing and
warm approval on many occasions. Ex-
Miristcr of N. S. Wales, said as
far back as 1911: —
The proposed amendments consist, firstly, of power
to give effect to the New Protection policy. I am a
Freetrader, but if we must have heavy duties....
then I believe in the manufacturer’s employee get-
ting a fair share of the profits made—-a fair and
reasonable wage. If the New Protection were a
separate issue at the Referenda, I venture to think
it would be carried by a large majority.
The Australian Government has no need to
cast round for a means of “elaborating” a
system of New Protection, as is suggested by
the Telegraph. The thing was done when
the Excise Tariff Act. 1906, was passed.
The High Court declared it invalid, owing to
the presence of the Trade and Commerce
clause in the Constitution. _ And there is
only one way by which this well-developed
and exhaustively explained, and highly ela-
borated and likewise widely approved system
may be rendered effective —namely, by an
affirmative vote to the Trade and Commerce
clause amendment proposal next May.
The distressful Sydney Ferries, Ltd., hav-
ing been driven to pay its deck hands as
much as Bs. per day, has replied by collect-
ing from 15 to 58 p.c. more from its regular
customers. The co. has got so into the habit
of making money that it can’t bump against
even a misfortune without trying to coin it
into dividends. In seven years it has added
the Kanimbla, Kuba, Ivirawa, Kaikai,
Kailoa, Kirrule, Iviandra, Kosciusko and a
few horse-punts, etc., to its fleet, at a cost
of about £150,000; it has added £46,262
(net) to its cash balances; it has put about
£15,000 (net) into wharves, plant, etc.; and
£42,684 (net) has gone into the purchase of
Harbor foreshores and other landed pro-
perty. The total of these four items alone
is £253,946. And all the capital the share-
holders have put up in that period is
£134,389. This means that in the past seven
years this company’s customers have not
only supplied a dividend of about 14 p.c. on
the shareholders’ capital actually paid, but
have also provided £119,557 of assets. Or
put it another way: of the £150,000 which
the Kanimbla, Kubu. Kirawa, Kaikai,
Kailoa, Kirrule, Kiandra and Kosciusko
have cost, the co. has nrovidecT £30.443 and
the co.’s customers £119,557 in addition to
the dividends. It is absurd, of course, to
expect that a co. with such a record could
afford to pay its deck-hands 10 p.c. more
wages without requiring its customers to
pay anything up to 58 p.c. more for the use
of a ferry which they have paid for out of
their own pockets.
A Dominant Note.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(1) The Australian is a loafer. (2) The Aus-
tralian is selfish. (3) Thank God the Maorilander
is not as the Australian. — Synopsis of the published
views and opinions of T. L. Mdls, Esq., of Maori-
land.
What is the dominant note of Australian scenery ?
That which is the dominant note of Edgar Allen
Poe’s poetry—Weird Melancholy.— Marcus Clarke.
Our forests, they tell us, are solemn, our
mountains are secret and stern ;
There is l&lackness and gloom in our gorges
—all is dust in our Poesy’s urn!
Thus the Millses and Clarkes by the
column, as they rise in their turns to
explain—-
(What a cheerful procession of Borgias,
and how vast are their howls of dis-
dain !)
There is death in the poems that we grow—
’tis a story of sullen despair
That is told in the desolate verses our
Daleys and Bradys prepare!
John Milton’s “L’ Allegro” and “Comus’i
distant, of course, from our scope :
Still, in spite of these creakings of hearses,
we brandish large symptoms of Hope!
We regret that our landscape is ghostly, and
the flights of our white cockatoos
Grieve us deeply indeed. We ask pardon for
the leaps of our grey kangaroos!
Our sun sinks instanter, and mostly our hills
seem to frown on the scene,
Whilst the strength of this land seems to
harden into men who are sudden and
Our soil has no past, has no story—kooka-
burras discordantly shriek;
Yet the trend of this nation is upward ahd
most unmistakably Greek!
The secret foundations of glory are laid in
the depths of our hearts,
And the spielers whose footsteps spiel Cup-
ward are this land’s least signficant
parts!
Our nation looms vague and gigantic, so the
critics who bound on its marge
See the husk that’s imported and British—
not the soul of Australia at large !
So they jump and they howl, corybantic,
and they fashion with brimstone and
gall
Long screeds which describe us as skittish
and careless, disloyal and small!
And we laugh—there’s no end of our grin-
ning, no end to this continent’s smile ;
For these Persons are most entertaining,
and they help to amuse us awhile!
It is there that we’re patently sinning—each
scandalised Britisher knows
That this land is a wilderness, paining John
Bull with its smoodge-lacking pose!
Still, we note that the Islands Explosive,
which crawl on their stummick to Bull,
Show a sudden if late disposition to copy
our notions in full!
Whilst the voice of a desolate Joseph is
raised where the titles are stored,
It is Massey’s and Allen’s ambition to
jump on the projects of Ward !
So we smile, as I mentioned, and also hear
hearty Canadian yells
For a fleet on our Commonwealth’s pattern
—disloyalty patently tells !
And ’tis strange that Field Marshals should
call so for armies made after our plan—
Can it be that Britannia’s the slattern, and
the loafing Australian the Man?
Vast shadows infesting our spaces, lone
horsemen ’twixt moonlight and dawn —
Can it be that we’ve shaped us a nation
whilst Maoriland leapt to the pawn?
How queer are our gumtrees —who traces
hieroglyphics so strange in their guise ,
Can we really expect approbation in the
Cockneyfied Britisher’s eyes?
Unsoothed bv the flames of the martyr, slow-
grilled at the Ignorance-stake,
Can it be that our mood is reliant, our man-
hood erect and awake?
No Propputy-vote in our Charter —oh, say,
can this miracle be ;
Is Australia the good-humored giant, too
large for Pig Island to see?
VICTORIA.

WHERE
EVERYBODY
GOES
“ J.R.” : Thus Governor Strickland, at
Sydney Town Hall, the other night:—
We have seen that missionaries and their work
have support, both moral and financial, not only
from an eminently religious people like the British.
Etc., etc.
A comparatively insignificant section of
Britishers continue to support the futile
business of despatching parsons to convert
the heathen. The huge majority, finding
that the heathen is rarely converted, and
that, when he is, the process usually turns
him into a liar and a thief or worse, have
lost interest in missionising. In most parts
of the earth where the good old Union Jack
flies, the missionary and his efforts are a
stock joke on about the same plane as the
mother-in-law one that has come down to us
from the pleistocene period. So far as official-
dom is concerned, if there is one class of
persons against which the British Govern-
ment has set its face like a flint in its deal-
ings with its polychrome empire, it is the
missionaries. In India it has persistently
ignored them, and ignores them still. It
Will not even subsidise their schools, though
it generously subsidises Hindu and Moslem
schools. A similar attitude is observable
elsewhere. Ask any British official you
chance to meet in a nigger-infested country
what he thinks of the local missionary, and
the odds are 10 to one you will find his
synonym for the holy man is “blanky nuis-
ance,” or words to that effect.
«
Frank C.: The Fusion candidates continue
to be sorely afflicted with a great lack of
intellect, accentuated by a plentiful dearth of
ideas. Thus Senator McColl, at Ballarat,
decrying the sanest part of Fisher’s policy,
the expenditure on defence (out of revenue,
by the way) :
In 1902 Mr. J. C. Watson said that £500,000 a
year was sufficient for Australia’s defence, but lately
Senator Pearce said that £5,000,000 was not too
much. What a change !
Poor dull McOoll can’t see that things are
now vastly different from what they were in
1902 —that Japan has licked Russia, and a
lot of other things have happened in 10
years. And consider his financial ideas: —
Mr. Fisher’s note issue had largely brought about
the financial stringency. The banks had to pay Mr.
Fisher 10 millions in gold for his notes, and thus
half their reserves were taken away. That meant" less
money was available.
Does the foolish old man really believe that
banks lent out the money they held as
reserves against their note issues? Listen
again to the outpourings of Palmer, M.P.
for Echuca :
Mr. Fisher claimed that his Government did not
go to the money-lenders of the world, but simply
borrowed from itself. True, but Mr. Fisher might
have added: “You cannot take some millions of
money out of circulation without contributing to the
dearness of money.”
The hopelessly muddled rail-straddler seems
to think that when Fisher borrows from
himself, he hoards the money away in a pri-
vate place. Bull Cohen has lent tens of
millions to himself, and the scarcity of
money in Britain must be something appal-
ling by now; yet it contrives to lend a pound
or two even to outsiders at times.
Died on Monday “Jim” Anderson, K.C.,
who might have got the vote as Adelaide’s
most popular citizen —a fine sportsman,
with plenty of public, spirit, and in court
an agile cross-examiner and a dashing
speaker. His wife is a daughter of Judge
Gordon (S.A.), and father-in-law and son-
in-law had more than most men in com-
mon.
Another curse came home to the import-
er’s roost and crowed dismally a few days
ago. It appears that last year there was a
shortage of cement in New South Wales,
and the Public Works Department manfully
grappled with the difficulty by importing
supplies from the obliging and cheap-labor
foreigner and lifting them over Australia’s
non-Protective tariff wall. By-and-bye, the
temporary rush for cement ceased, but the
Department’s orders from abroad continued
to arrive with enthusiasm and expedition.
Thereabouts, the local manufacturers came
to the conclusion that they might as well go
out of business until the importations ceased,
but, finally, rather than close their works,
they agreed to pay £22)0, the cost of 27,000
barrels of cement under order, on condition
that the Works Department cancelled its
foreign orders. So local industry once more
gets a show.
H. H. Champion writes:—
In a recent issue there is a par. about the
Andersen case, in which my name is mentioned. I
have no time to show how many misstatements it
contained, but would ask you to print the following
matter, dated 25th February, 1913, from T. Tunne-
cliffe, M.L.A., who asked on what terms Andersen
could be free from detention in the Ivew Asylum as
a lunatic (the Dr. Jones referred to is the Inspector-
General of the Insane for Victoria:—“l saw Dr.
Jones yesterday (Monday afternoon) in the presence
of Mr. Callaway, Under-Secretary, and he promised
me that he would give Mr. Peter Andersen a full
discharge, which could first be read by Mr. Holden-
sen (Danish Consul) or myself. This he would hand
to Mr. Holdensen or myself or any responsible per-
son on a guarantee that it would not be delivered to
Mr. Andersen until he was out of the Commonwealth;
that is, I take it, after the boat leaves its last port
of call within the Commonwealth.” I thought this
delightful. Andersen is a lunatic while in Australia,
but could be certified to be sane if he will only go
away.

13,999 people, this paper won’t argue about
the discrepancy. In a time like the present,
when the weather is bad. and domestic ser-
vants are almost unattainable, and a new
strike happens almost every week, no one
save a madman would look for needless
quarrels merely because the weekly attend-
ance at “Puss in Boots” is one individual
less than the management says it is.
The Crystal Palace broke out into colors
this week with ‘“The Doctor’s Patient.” On
the whole, these artificially-colored films look
more perfect than the kinemacolor, though
evidently they can’t be turned out as
rapidly. But, apart from the fine coloring,
the doctor’s patient has little to recommend
it. “The Suez Canal,” at the same theatre,
provided some good scenes of that warm
spot. “The Mystery of the Elk Bank,” at
the Colonial, was another of the detective
yarns wherein, for the very manyth time, the
’tec., after being almost eaten alive by the
secret society, comes home to the missuus
with another batch c f scalncj.

Cummin and Seaham, who are half-
brothers to Gowome and Gitwork. are the
latest excuse for taking the girl to the
Tivoli. They come unburdened with super-
latives, and merely book themselves as
knockabouts, and, particularly in a hat
manipulating act, they offer a very tooth-
some mixture of nonsense and novelty. Tay-
lor and Arnold, the ragtimers, make their
third re-appearance, and look capable of
making a thirteenth without causing the box-
office receipts to wilt. The Clark-Owen turn,
Henri French, Will Whitburn and Alex.
Prince are other baits held out by the man-
agement. A matinee is being given this
(Thursday) afternoon, with the object of
helping the stranded Atkinson’s circus
people out of the soup that bad Melbourne
weather and a two-weak treasury landed
them _ in. The programme will be a pot-
pourri of selections from current shows.
The National Amphitheatre is featuring
a perfect herd of new stars this week. The
pride of the collection is Paul Gorden, the
world’s greatest wire-walking drunk. Many
an honest, right-thinking citizen has felt asi
though he were walking on a wire when he
was merely proceeding along his own garden
path. Paul does the actual thing, and does
it well. Associated with him are Spenser
Kelly and Marion Wilder, who sing dis-
tractingly, Mathews and Mack, travesty
stars, and a dozen others of merit, or there-
abouts.
At the Palace, “A Woman of Impulse”
will be introduced on Saturday night in the
place of “Dr. Wake’s Patient” by the Hamil-
ton-Plimmer co. The piece made many
friends some little time back when it was
presented by Talbot, Ltd., at the same the-
atre. There will be four nights only of im-
pulsive lady, as the season must be closed
on Wednesday in order that the co. may
reach Melbourne in time to open on the fol-
lowing Saturday night. The ponderous
leaps of the Sydney-Melbourne express are
responsible for some very fried language by
show managers these days.
Fred Niblo. of the mournfully beautiful
clothes, and Miss Josephine Cohan, of the
wistful smile and the scrubbing-brush, sup-
ported by their menagerie of wild “rubes,”
continue to attract audiences to “The For-
tune Hunter” at Sydney Criterion. And
if among the menagerie one only knew
which animal was which actor, this
critic might be able to pat several on the
back and prod a few with a vicious umbrella.
But there are 15 of them, and the writer is
no good at logarithms.
The Adelphi, having collected its reserve
supers, finds that its supply of kings, prime
ministers and wood-cutters will last for an-
other eight nights ; then, there being no one
else worth killing, “From Convent to Throne”
will itself die a natural death. “The
Woman Pays” is announced as the successor.
This is said to be a local production dealing
with the Sydney Ferries’ season tickets.
At the Little Theatre “The Man on the
Box” has not yet gone on strike, nevertheless
in these infectious days, when Sydney lives
in a state of chronic upheaval, it is a wise
management that has another money-maker
ready for an emergency. Wherefore, the
second production is being prepared. It is
to be “Fanny’s First Play,” which received
the most exclusive approval of the purple
when George and Mary commanded Granville
Barker, who was producing it at the Ivings-
way Theatre, London, to stage it at Downing-
street for the special edification of members
of the Amalgamated Union of Monarchs,
Princes, Gentlemen Ushers, Dukes, Lady-
Helps, Duchesses and Royal Unemployed
visiting the Big Smoke at Coronation time.
Altogether, the piece ran into 600 perform-
ances in London, which is classical business
for comedy. The date of its introduction to
Sydney is not yet announced. Meanwhile,
“The Man on the Box” is plying for hire
nightly and on Thursday afternoons.
“THE BELLE OF NEW YORK," AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
Bronson (Leslie Holland), a pugilist (Edward
Nable), and actor Mugg (Arthur Lissant).
“Lizzie” is still sweating blood, or rum, or
whatever liquid it is that pours from the
cuticle of an able-bodied female hippo., at
Wirths’ circus entrance. Madam Garcia
descends nightly the chute of death, and
death retires with a hurt feeling to consider
why a lady whose motor-car throws three
somersaults in the air shouldn’t become his
prey. La Belle Victoria smiles as charm-
ingly as ever while she swings her Mexican
beauty to and fro on the slackest of all slack
wires. The Flying Codonas whirl in the
air, blindfold and otherwise ; and the clowns
—well, the clowns and Polar bears are just
clowns and Polar bears. Which is to say
that Wirths’ circus is still going strong in
the Belmore Markets, Sydney, and endeavor-
ing, with marked success, to make good its
modest claim to be the greatest show on
earth. In defence of its general character,
the writer offers it his sworn testimonial
as the least smellful circus he has ever met.
f*
“The Belle of New Vork” will ring at
Sydney Royal for the last time on Friday of
next week. The public will tear itself re-
gretfully away from Ichabod Bronson. He
is a rare old pietist, not exactly a Chadband
or a Pecksniff or a Heep or a Mawworm.
but a snufflebuster who knows the joy of
life —a festive,_ long-legged Wesleyan with
hop-leaves in his hair, and yet not so many
hop-leaves as to be in danger of degenerat-
ing into a Stiggins. Bronson may be de-
scribed as the leaping or ballet-dancing
hypocrite, and he is one of the few hypo-
crites who tend to make their job popular.
Ichabod _ was probably at his best when
Oscar Girard did him, and as Girard was a
dying skeleton in those days, the fact was
all the more remarkable. Something else
will follow “The Belle” at the Royal, but
on this subject a certain scarcity of infor-
mation prevails so far.
“ BeQ Hur,” at Adelaide Royal, h as had
that crowded second week which in the H i
City, means a big success. With the multi
tude increasing, and no other house compete
in drama the Royal is on a good wicket these
times Ben Hur” has the defects always
attaching to the play that is made out nf »
novel. It has not the directness, for ex
ample, of Claudian,” perhaps the neared
previous thing to it; and it weakens down
from the first two strong acts. But it is a
fine spectacle, and has a fine cast, the lavish
ing of good men on little parts being remark
able. "I aust is closing the season Th P

Branscombe’s Dandies have had a vice-regal
night; but the evenings are growing chilly f or
the open, and they contemplate a flight to
some place where they can perform indoors
Drama is the chief feature of the pictures
this week. The Empire has revived the fiery
“Father” film, and Wondergraph—whose new
house in Hindley-street is nearly finished-
shows a thrilling Reincarnation drama
West’s, on the other hand, is having a hum-
orous week, and “In a Fix” shows Asta
Nielsen in a new light as comedienne.
Evidently “The Count of Luxembourg,”
which derived its music from the composer
of “The Merry Widow,” is not destined to
outrival its relative. There are some pretty
waltz and other dance strains in the “play”
introduced to Australian at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.) last Saturday, but the performance
left no haunting echoes in the ear, nor did it
ever begin to look like a record-breaker. Of
novelty in story, characterisation, or irrele-
vant items there is none whatever. A hand-
somely 7 decorated show, containing many
lively legs, two or three passable songs and a
lot of fitful bustle, is a thing to be seen, of
course. Having seen “The Count of Luxem-
bourg,” the most willing slaves of comic
opera will soon forget it. Heavy-footed
Talleur Andrews is utterly unsuited to the
name part, and Florence Young, as the
heroine, can give him no assistance to speak
of in the mazy waltz. Their waltz up the
broad, easy staircase at the back of the Grand
Duke’s reception hall was painfully labored
on the first night. The briskness of W. S.
Percy, as the Grand Duke, seems mechanical
rather than snontaneous, whilst his allusions
to his fluttering old heart grow wearisome.
Sybil Arundale, in a colorless soubrette cha-
racter, is merry and bright, but the music
asks more of her singing voice than she can
give, and her share of the dialogue is dull
stuff, like everybody else’s share. Phil Smith,
the new comedian, who paints his face a
strawberry tint and terminates many of his
sentences with a partial snigger or chuckle,
is nimble on his feet and funny in spots. At
a first hearing, one compares him favorably
with Bertie Wright, insofar- that his buffoon-

The Williamsonian chorus, in a foolish sort
of way,
Came in Carnival disguises and pretended
to be gay.
They frivolled round a table,
Raising Cain if they were able,
And they made an awful babel when pre-
tending to be gay.
The student Count of Luxembourg, a stony-
broke young man,
Consented to be wedded, like Don Caesar do
Bazan,
To a girl whose name he knew not, nor her
eyes had ever seen.
He pushed his hand in marriage through an
intervening screen.
The Count was paid to do it,
And the prima-donna knew it,
So they sang a bridal duet whilst the screen
was in between.
The bantam Grand Duke Rutzinov, a cousin
of the Czar,
Though somewhat more than old enough to
be the lady’s Par,
Was booked to take the Countess for his
wife in legal course,
If her marriage with the stranger could be
ended by divorce.
But they met and were delighted,
When they found they were united,
And the ducal hopes were blighted re that
pre-arranged divorce.

And tricks of style suggestive of a Christmas

Paired off with Sybil Arundale, who capered

At the Bijou, the demand for “The Graft-
ers” is still running to eight performances
a week. A “Texas Tommy Dance” by the
entire company, is a newly-added link in
the Grafter chain or vaudeville-comedy
items, and the silly old belief that no profit
could come out of a venture at the Bijou is
now quite faded and gone, like the last Rose
of Summer.

quently sung.

playlet by Edward Dyson, entitled “The
Climax.”
At the Majestic (Melbourne), this week,
they are putting “The Red Hand” on the
screen for matinees only, the Apache dance
in that bloodthirsty drama coming as an un-
gentle reminder of how Parisian Bill’s donah
likes him to chuck her about. The star film
in the programme at night deals with the
fabulous Kingdom of Silistria, where an

spirators waste their time in futile endea-

The film de resistance at Spen-
cers Olympia is a dumb dramatisa-
tion ot Blackmore’*- “Lorna Doone,” which
suggests further possibilities in the way of
putting on the screen the plots of old-
established novels that have never been
staged. Also it suggests the probability of
a time coming when new and original picture
plays will be plagiarised by novelists, and
the film and the book will advertise one
another.
. T l!r e l J ova bl e characters in “Milestones,”
at Melbourne _ Royal, are endearing them-
selves to an interested public, and a uni-
versal smile of satisfaction rewards young
Ronald Macleod when he orders Lord
Monkhouse to “shut up.” Monkhouse is the
one dislikeable character in the play. It
speaks well for the impersonator (Martin
Lewis) that the audience is glad to see his
hereditary nobility sat upon by his sister’s
best hoy.
Parramatta, Joe Cook, explaining the
Liberal programme, nearly wept when he
talked of the sinfulness of the jLabor party in
attempting, to. “interfere” with the magnifi-
cent Constitution, so “clear, precise and logi-
cal, that was “adopted” only 12 years ago.
It may be a sacrosanct document, and it may
be particularly wicked for mere mortals to
amend it only 12 years after it got into oper-
ation ; but, in that case, what can we think
of the infamy of the Deakin-Cook Govern-
ment which carried through a referendum
tor the alteration of the same Constitution
in two places when the sacred thing was only
nine years old !
A wail about scarcity of employment was
recently upheaved in Melbourne, and, of
course, the Government was urged to borrow
a new heap of money and start building a lot
ot probably unprofitable public works. It
would be interesting to know how Melbourne,
or any other old place in the Commonwealth,
expects, under the present tariff, to avoid
the unemployed trouble. In 1910 this fool
country imported £42.700,000 worth of goods,
which was £42.700.000 worth of work it
didn t have. In 1911 it imported £48.000,000
worth of goods, which was £48,000,000 worth
fro’^A^i :ave awa y- In 1912 it imported
t 02,000,000 worth of goods, which repre-
sented £52,000,000 worth of honest toil
deliberately thrown overboard. A commun-
't.v of that sort deserves to be unemployed.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The Imperial (Hyde Park) Roller Rink Co.
opened for the 1913 season on Monday evening’.
General-manager Bendrodt was on his old stand at
the top end of the palatial marble steps. Here, he
extends the glad hand to the plain citizen or’the
naughty Miss, and passes on the Order of the Boot
to the joyous hooligan. The Imperial Roller Rink
has the unrivalled advantage of having, been built
tor its present purpose. In this it is unlike rnanv
minor places of amusements such as small local
concert halls which have apparently been designed
tor hen roosts or sewing bees. The Imperial maple
floor is as perfect for roller skating as experts can
make it. Under its milk-white surface three sub-
floors or catacombs (to bury the loud noises of many
leet) give an exhilarating spring to the roller-
wheels, and assist the beginner to fall softly over
his own feet. A thousand skaters glide comfortably
°y e r fhis Tinker’s dream of delight. On the opening l
night Youth and Beauty swished round under a

Zoug Arabs have discovered how the stirring of an
audience may be accelerated and amplified by weird
sounds. These nimble Africans toss themselves
through the atmosphere with much variety and aston-
ishing velocity. Yet their turn would gang in dead
silence but for the unusual interjections of the full
strength of the company. When a man is not rip-
ping across space, like a disordered comet, he is
standing in the wings, assisting to make unchristian
clamor, with the result that an acrobatic act takes
on the atmosphere of a national jamboree of South
Sea cannibals, and the blood of the audience leaps
and bounds in half-anticipation of a terrible sight
that will end in the smallest Arab being bitten to
death by his rabid companions.
“J.S.R.”: I fancy I can see what G. Shaw’s
trouble is when he has to circularise Big Fog audi-
ences as to how to behave. The Shaw play being
now quite the correct thing in alleged smart circles,
all sorts of affluent but wooden-headed persons turn
up, and in order to profess that they can see the
joke, force themselves to laugh like all the hyenas
on earth. They don’t see the joke, but think that
they ought to. Hence the unnatural and distracting
noises. No Shaw play appeals to any irresponsible
emotion in a way to compel a demonstration. Shaw
tickles the mind with subtleties for internal consump-
tion, and not outward explosion.
“Snell”: From “topical allusions,” good Lord de-

comes to us from far lands, but the imported bosh
does not lie so heavy upon me as the imbecility made
on the premises by Antipodean experts. Take the
case of “The Grafters,” at Melbourne Bijou. It
came as a company of strangers to a strange land,
and it was infamously beguiled into spotting its in-
tensely American burlesque with trifling Australian
gags, glaringly foreign, and pitifully weak. If one
cannot rise above bald references to O’Malley’s hat
or crude allus ; ons to the baby bonus, in Mercy’s

oTT/TT Geach writes: “Private Boxer” (B.
20/3/13) comes to the conclusion that pictures are
on the wane simply because the demeanor of the
audience of a Sixpenny Palace was not one of
hysterics over the fare provided. As a matter of
iact, speaking from some years’ experience, fully 95
per cent, of the pic-
tures, no matter of
what excellence, fail
to secure the glad
hand ; so one can only
come to the con-
clusion that “Private
Boxer” has only just
awakened. The fol-
lowing quotation is
from a trade paper:
“No signs are yet

with some unusual horses and a few sloppy per-

were due to gather up the remains, they trooped in,

London, are known m Australia. These are Wini-
E . mery . ( Mrs - Queckett, the staid schoolmistress
also , an opera bouffe. star). Boucicault
(Queckett) and Gwenn (Admiral Rankling). Wini-
fred Emery came to Australia with her father, that
excellent comedian Sam Emery, son of a great one
John, of the same ilk. Sam and WSnifred, now Mrs’
Cyril Maude, were so hard run in Melbourne that thev
were reduced to acting at L. L. Smith’s Polytechnic
m isourke-street. Sam’s Peggotty was a fine per-
formance m London, he was the King to Fechter’s
Harniet. Boucicault is, of course, our old friend
Bob Brough’s partner. Gwenn was in Louise Wal-
dorf s company. Brough and Bouev staged “The
Schoolmistress” in Australia. Mrs. Brough was the
schoolmistress, Brough acted Queckett, and Charley
Brown was Admiral Rankling. He never gloated
more over a part, which is saying a good deal, for
he was a great gloater. Brough’s Queckett was great.
Vou could never surpass Brough as a puzzled person.
Boucicault is a pastmaster of technique, but Brough
had the finer sense of humor and the face to paint
it on.
Back in Australia, after nearly seven
years divided between Paris and London,
H, S. Power, the Adelaide painter. Always
preferring animals as his subject, he has
made, big cheques latterly in England, doing
favorite horses and hunt-meets for country
gentlemen—including the Speaker of the
Commons and King Edw-ard, who gave a
special commission for an Australian bul-
lock-team. The artist proposes to give one-
man Power exhibitions in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, as well as Adelaide.
Died at Pakenham (Vic.), aged 78, Francis
Parry Atkinson, who has had his fingers in
printers’ ink hereabouts for 59 years. He took
eight months to come out in a 102-ton
barque. When he had got over the motion
of the ocean he joined first the Melbourne
Hebald and, later, the Abgus. Thence he
went to Maoriland, and presently rose to the
eminence of Government Printer of Fiji.
Back again in Melbourne, he toiled in the
Government Printing Office, and there de-
signed the first postal note that Victoria ever
issued. He also HANSABD-ed to some extent.
Though Victoria’s disastrous land boom
of a generation ago .is almost forgotten, a
few of its little relics are still being put
away to. rest. One such was finally covered
up in discreet silence recently in the shape
of a declaration of a first and final divi-
dend of 23-40ths of a penny in the £ in the
estate of the late Dr. George Lefevre. The
estate, when sequestrated in ’93, showed lia-
bilities £113,000, assets £83,433; but,
through the subsequent drop in values, it
only pans out a halfpenny in the pound. It
~ hardly worth all these years of bother.

of W. M. Hughes’ speech at the Glebe (Syd-
ney) :—•
Mr. Cook (great laughter) has told you we have
been guilty of an orgy of extravagance.
What a blighting criticism the words under-
lined constitute of the futile leader of Lib-
eralism, when one comes to think about it T
JNo audience, hbwsoever hostile, has been
known to rock with merriment at the mere
mention of Deakin, or J. C. Watson, or Wil-
ham Lyne, or even Wade of N. S. Wales, or
Watt of,Victoria. Grim and hopeless is the
lot of the party leader the sound of whose
name affects the populace like the spectacle
of a stout man falling over his own feet.
THE TRULY GREAT ACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The actor of 20 years ago was better than the actor
of to-day.— Mr. Walter Bentley before a Wages Board.
The actor of the other day
Mas everything that heart could wish.
He had a manner and a way,
And gave his splendid tail a swish
Wheh striding histrionic boards,
And dealing with the ruffian hordes.
His roaring shook the mimic scene,
Expressing all of human woe.
Imposing was his brow and mien,
And awesomely he dragged his toe.
Then his digestion, too, was good—
If need arose he fed on wood.
His art was serious, intense.
Well drilled he was. He had to learn
With action fine to suit the sense.
He did his Hamlet to a turn ;
And pretty ladies loved him so,
Some five-and-thifty years ago.
The actor of the olden time
In all his parts was truly great.
In diction he was quite sublime,
In gesture so appropriate.
His like the world will never see.
I ought to know, for I am he!

From last Saturday’s S. M. Herald :
In the party are four singers, namely, Messrs. P.
J. Gilbert (tenor), P. H. Metcalf (tenor), C. M.
Keeler (baritone), and E. W. Peck (bass) ; and they
gave a taste of their quality. So pleased were their
hearers that an encore was vociferously demanded.
The verve oi F. B. Smith (their leader) is both
physical and spiritual. In gymnasium trunks he
would look like a pugilist or a wrestler. His
shoulders resemble the crags of a mountain, and his
legs are of amazing circumference. At college he
rowed in the regular crews. He also boxed with his
pile-driver fists. Trained, he ought to be able to
throw a horse and pull a loaded waggon uphill, etc.
The stuff about the singers is not, as might
be imagined, the work of one of Hugh D.
OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF
BABES, ETC.
"Come, come, Letitia, kiss your uncle and tell

is not a Stadium star newly-imported by
Snowy Baker. It is simply the preliminary
whoop of the la' est band of Yankee evan-
gelists to arrive in these parts. How the
disciples would have reeled had they been
instructed to go after “the lost sheep of the
house of Israel” with vaudeville turns and
incredible assertions concerning the vast-
ness of their legs! Apparently Smith isn’t
in search of the lost sheep. It is the lost
and fainted elephant he is going to bring
back on his shoulders.
The French had a lovely windfall last
week, when the latest German war-Zepoe-
lin, lost in a fog, descended in a fortified
French area and was immediately seized by
the military. The Germans on board were
in uniform, and the air ship was of the
latest pattern and had quite a number of
secret devices. They are secret no longer,
the French having made the most of their
opportunity. The German air ships hold
the world’s record for long-distance travel-
ling, and British and French engineers have
been quite unable to unravel the mystery of
their success. Now the Frenchmen know
anyhow, and the applause is something tre-
mendous.
Two cases from the Sydney Police Courts
this week by way of keeping up their repu-
tation :—•
Edward Snowden and James Walker were sentenced
at the Central Court to six months’ imprisonment on
a charge of stealing 54ft. of rubber hose from the
Glebe Public School.
Archibald Palmer, a dairyman living at Rook-
wood, was charged at the Children’s Court, Parra-
matta, with cruelty to a ward of the State. Dr.
Brown, on the witness-stand, said it was the worst
case he had ever seen. He thought the bruises had
been caused by the lad being hit with the handle of
a whip as well as the thong. The lad must have
suffered a great deal, and he had been in the Parra-
matta Hospital for 10 days. The dairyman was
fined £lO, in default three months’ imprisonment.
Which is eloquent of the difference in value
between rubber hose and mere cow-slaves.

One of the original houses built on Syd-
ney’s “Golden Corner” (King and George
Streets) by Joe Wyatt, in 1834, is to come
down, Waters, Limited, being about to re-
build. Nearly opposite is the last bit of
“Old Sydney” in the locality—a house at
one time occupied by Woolley,
an ironmonger, and afterwa •ds
the Golden Fleece Hotel. E\ ry
place in old Sydney seems. to
have been a hotel at one time
or another. In 1834 Wyatt
gave £55 10s. a foot for the
George-street frontage of the
corner —hence “Golden Corner,”
because the price was then
reckoned prodigous. It would be worth that
much per half-inch now. #
In its comments (2/4/’l3) on the ap-
pointment of Justice Rich to the High
Court Bench, Sydney Telegraph demon-
strated, with exceptional force, its Plaza
Toro-like capacity for leading public opinion
—from behind. An extract: —
The High Court, it cannot be repeated too often,
is not only the highest legal arbiter within the Com-
monwealth, but the warden of the Federal Constitu-
tion. If its members are not to be as capable law-
yers as ive have, it had better hot exist. So far,
they have been among our best, and with this latest
appointment there is nothing to find fault. But
with the course of action which led up to it, it is
another matter. Two out of the three High Court
appointments were such as to suggest that they had
not been made with that care which a Government,
actuated by the sole desire of strengthening the
Bench, would have exercised. One appointee has re-
signed, and the Federal Government has now in that
case corrected its mistake. But what about the other.
One who was unacquainted with the rail-
sitting, Jump Jim Crow methods of our
local Tory dailies might imagine from the
above that the Telegraph had been hostile
to the Piddington-Powers appointments from
the start. What were the facts? The
’Graph announced those appointments on
February 14 last. It allowed Attorney-
General Hughes to say of Mr. Piddington
in an interview :—-
He was a man of the highest capacity, with a pro-
found knowledge of law. He also had in a marked
degree the calm and judicial temperament necessary
for the high and responsible duties of a justice, and
was a man of great force of character. He would
prove himself worthy to rank along with those dis-
tinguished men who have hitherto exercised the
functions of High Court Judges.
On its own behalf it mentioned Mr. Pidding-
ton’s “brilliant career at Sydney Univer-
sity,” and his signal success at the N. S.
Wales Bar. And for Mr. Powers it had
nothing but praise. During a month or
more, while this paper and others were
strenuously denouncing the new appoint-
ments as an insult to the High Court and
to the collective intelligence of the electors,
the King-street organ lay low. And now,
when the shouting and tumult have died
away, to all intents and purposes, it takes
up a very resolute attitude indeed, and says
in effect that the appointments which seemed
to it good two months ago are really rotten.

According to the decision of an Adelaide
court, the “entirely given up” of the baby-
advertisements means, legally, just nothing
at all. In this case, the mother paid £l5
before the birth of the child to have it taken
off her hands for ever, and signed an agree-
ment to that effect. But when it was a
month or two old she went to visit it, grew
fond of it, and finally carried it off. The
foster-mother —a highly respectable woman
—claimed 19 guineas for her damaged affec-
tions and six guineas for the pram, in which
the infant travelled; but the Court, while
allowing that she had “all the merits of the
case,” said that the Law does not allow a
child to be “sold,” and she could claim for
nothing but sums out of pocket, and the £l5
should cover that. Tableau. Re-union of

MUTUAL EXPECTATIONS.
HE: “ You know I expect to
be rich what the old man
pegs out."
SHE: " So do I; he proposed
to me this morning."
One of the first official acts of Victoria’s
new Police Commissioner should be to invite
excuses from a plain-clothes constable whom
a P.M. lately stated had committed a “cruel
and unjustifiable act” in publicly telling a
fruit-hawker that he “did not wish to speak
to him as he was a convicted thief.” As the
hawker had but one mark against him, and
that was nearly 10 years old, most men
would have allowed the dust to remain un-
disturbed. But the Victorian “force” seems
to act on the principle that, if it can’t catch
new criminals, it can at least goad old ones
into activity. The P.M. promptly dismissed
the charge of “insulting language” against
the hawker. He had called the Law s
minion a “cowardly blackguard.” Has
Sainsbury much use for officers who can be
called cowardly blackguards with impunity?
Dr. Green, who bishes for a crust at Bal-
larat, has just maintained the high level of
inaccuracy reached in most clerical utter-
ances. Said he: “The Christian Church
recognises no lawful dissolution of marriage
for any cause whatever, except the one
specified by Christ Himself, i.e., adultery.”
As a matter of fact, the Greek Church,
which numbers something over 100,000,000
adherents, recognises a whole heap of rea-
sons other than post-nuptial giddiness. Also,
the Scotchbyterian Kirk allows divorce for
desertion, and reckons it has Scriptural
authority for doing so. Since Dr. Green is nre-
sumably aware of these facts, it would
seem that he regards everybody outside the
Anglican sect as heathens, whose chances of
bliss beyond the undertaker are not worth
considering.
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
More history! S.M. Herald, in an article on
birth of the Bank of N S. Wales, says that Robert
Lowe, who afterwards became Lord Sherbrooke and
was Chancellor of the Exchequer in England, was one
of the original shareholders. The bank was launched
in March, 1817. Robert Lowe was born in 1811
Apparently, therefore, this “original” shareholder was
just six years of age when he became an investor
As a matter of fact, Mr. Lowe didn’t arrive in Svd
ney till 1842. Robert Lowe, of Birling, Bringellv
may have been an original shareholder; but the
Bringelly Lowe was quite a different person from the
great albino financier who proposed to tax matches
and cats.
“Quidam”: In the Russo-Jap.
war the European nation did no-
thing to write home about in the
way of applying science to the
saving of soldiers’ lives. But the
Japanese, having grasped the
great principles of sanitation and
antiseptic treatment, applied
them so thoroughly that in all the
annals of war there never was so
little death, and never did such
a large proportion of wounded get
back to the firing line. In their
navy, the sailors were compelled
to take carbolic baths and put on
sterilised clothes before an en-
gagement, so that no germs
should be carried into wounds by
projectiles, themselves sterilised
by their lightning rush through
the air. Their turning -of the
teaching of sanitary science to
their furthest possible use was
the principal factor in the Japan-
ese success, so much so that the
saying that “Lister won the
war” is current among scientific
observers. All of which is merely
preliminary to the question whether this re-
quirement is pushed far enough to the front
in our own scheme of Defence. The writer,
for instance, recently heard a military in-
structor in a Victorian town —and a person
who thinks no small beer of himself, too-
stating dogmatically that water that had
filtered through Bft. of earth must be abso-
lutely devoid of disease, germ, and, therefore,
necessarily safe for drinking. That a man
whose job it is to teach our youngsters
how to keep themselves alive while
making it unpleasant for the other party
should have such a pitiably ancient belief
makes one think hard. To send a soldier
out into a campaign armed with pre-historic
lore of this sort is bound to result in his
rapidly becoming a dead soldier, and dead
soldiers are the kind that win campaigns for
the other side.
A beautifully-planned scheme for an alibi
went wrong the other day, all through that
inconvenient person, the man with a mem-
ory ; and now one Smith, of Melbourne, is
lamenting his wasted ingenuity. Recently
Smith, having transacted certain matters
with a Caulfield business woman, returned
to the city per train with her. Knowing
she was going home again by the next train,
Smith hired a swift taxi, whipped out to
Caulfield in 15 minutes, annexed some
jewellery he had noticed near a convenient
windowq and landed back in town about the
same time as the lady was entering her
house. The scheme was elegantly worked
out, and her visitor was the last person she
suspected; but the chauffeur, seeing the
report of the robbery, remembered his fares
haste to reach Caulfield and his swift
return, and mentioned the circumstance.
The rest was easy.

SUITABLE REFORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Barrister Maxwell, addressing the Indeterminate
Sentences Board, in Melbourne, the other day, de-
clared the penal system of Victoria to be “rotten.”
“Every circumstance in Pentridge tended to crush the
individuality of a man.” He advised taking prisoners
away from everything suggestive of their downfall.
He would give them decent clothes, “ even going so
far as to allow them to pick their own pattern and
choose their own ‘cut.’ ”
We know the tailor makes the man —
This much has often been admitted.
The color, pattern and the plan
Of vests and coats and trousers can
Do much to elevate the bloke
Who’s sadly doing time in choke.
No chap is good or nimble-witted
Who’s suit is cheap and badly fitted.
So give the burglar nice white ties,
And evening togs in which to sup, too,
The penal system that is wise
Provides smart shoes, the proper size,
And saucy bonnets —little loves! —
And natty, lemon-yellow gloves.
The girls should have a swagger pup, too,
Of breeding—something to live up to.
The well-dressed man can do no wrong;
Beau Brummels don’t break into houses.
So let the convicts go it strong
In skirted coats, cut wide and long
(Fine feathers make fine bird 3, we’re told).
Then if a fellow gets too bold,
Embezzles, burgles, or carouses,
Straight hang the man who made his “trouzes!”

Lawyers give good advice occasionally. A
Melbourne citizen lately limped into the
casualty room at the General Hospital and
exhibited a leg showing a gaping wound
which looked like the climax of an argu-
ment with a shark. “Dog bit it,” he said
laconically. “Went to a lawyer. He
advised me to come here.”
HER DRY HUMOR.
SUSAN: “Oh, no, Arthur, don I go bathing.
You don't look a bit like a gentleman when

SUGGESTIVE.
BOTTLE-OH : “Any empty bottles, lady?"
LADY (sharply) : “No, indeed.- We don't drink beer here."
BOTTLE-OH : " Vinegar bottles would do, mum."
“Hullo”: I am thinking of starting a cor-
respondence course in Bottle Messages. The
usual dead marine came ashore the other day
with a pencil note in
his innards : “We are
lost; there is no
hop e. —G.W.E., S.S.
Waratah.” It is like
all the other bottle
messages. It gives no
details, it is signed
merely with any ini-
tials that the writer
found handy, it sends
no dying message to
wife or relation, it
gives no directions for
rescue. In fact, it is,
like its tribe, as vague
as a spirit message
from Stead. If a pas-
senger on the Wara-
tah wanted to send a
message, he would ad-
dress it properly,
would indicate what
had struck the vessel
and what chance there
was of rescue, would
state the geographical
position of the ship,
and, above all, would
carefully sign in full.
But, simply because
m y correspondence
class has not been
started, the practical
jokers 'who pursue this
profession never add a
single human touch.
I guarantee that a
three-weeks’ course
would equip any stu-
dent to compose a
message that would thrill the world. Lists
of passengers and crews of all lost vessels
are supplied with the course, also specimen
letters to cover every conceivable catastrophe
at sea, and 18 more.
When Panos Bollieros came to Melbourne
to sella da banan’ he brought with him sweet
memories of Theodora Dendiros, whom he
had left behind in Greece, where old Ther-
mopylae used to be, and where the klephts
grow. As soon as he had settled down, he
wrote to Theodora and invited her to come
and marry him —and take the shop for her
trouble. She came. But before she
had; come, another damsel had stolen
Bollieros’ heart —and then closed on a
rival’s offer of an icecream cart. Bol-
lieros was thereby so upset that when Theo.
came he wouldn’t marry her, let alone give
her the fruit shop. She didn’t trouble about
Bollieros, but she went to law about the fruit
shop, and got a verdict for £3OO. Mistrustful
of courts. Panos had got in early and sold
the shop for £6O and cleared out. But Greek
had met Greek. Miss Dendiros sooled on the
law, which grabbed him, brought him back,
and told him to pay up at the rate of £4 per
month —in default three months’ hard. At
latest, he was inquiring the whereabouts of
the man who said that there were points
about having loved and lost. He wants to
argue the case with him —with special refer-
ence to a profitable banan’ shop. To love
two wopien, and lose both of them, also a
steady business and a lawsuit and £3OO, is a
one-sided transaction.
LUCID.
“Hello, Joe, hear you're on strike .”
“ Yes.”
"That are you out for?”
"Dunno! But we're not going back to work
till we get it.”
Broken Hill has been enjoying another
strike, strikes and processions being almost
its only diversions. The trouble this time
started on the Silverton Co.’s railway—the
one link between the big mining field and the
outer world—and that meant the closing-
down of the mines as soon as the ore-bins
were full. Broken Hill almost scorns to
strike over such a sordid matter as extra
pay: nearly all its outbursts have been over
some showy frill or other. This time it was
over the employment of an alleged non-union-
ist here and there. The unionists, declaring
that they were tired of battling for benefits
that non-unionists shared in, gave all hands
till April 1 to come in ; and practically all
hands came in to save trouble. The explo-
sion happened mainly because a few petty
bosses didn’t reckon that they should . be
branded and belong to the mob. It is annoy-
ing, no doubt, that a man should get benefits
that others who are no better off pay for;
but the trouble about roping in members
wholesale under threats of various sorts is
that the unions become filled with people
who are not unionists. Fpr two or three
years before the Broken Hill strike which
lasted five months and ended in utter defeat,
the mining cos. conceded the point that all
hands should be members of a union; but it
didn’t take long after the strike lasted to find
out that a whole pack of them weren’t union-
ists. To rope everybody in is all right; to
settle down comfortably after everybody is in
is simply suicide.
A RHYME OF THE TROUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Persons who dine in some of the citv restaurants
ar- of:.en reminded of the that 'others have
dined before them. Some months ago regulations
were gazetted with the view of securing the cleanli-
ness and freedom from contamination of articles of
food. Persons who read the regulations, however,
are firmly of opinion that they are not generally
enforced. — Aft lbourne Arcus.
What time our Greek restaurateur serves up his
splendid scran,
Is there a citizen would stoop to sniff his frying-
pan ?
When scents of rich, well-seasoned food come warmly
on the air,
Say, why should eighteenpencers peer too closely at
their fare?
What though the linen’s overripe, the fish-forks
edged with green ?
All’s well ! The regulations say our feedware must
be clean
Though things may not pleasant where the meat-
fly builds her nest,
And where the cupboard-rat is bold, and where great
* spiders rest
Among the long-discarded bones of old, forgotten
ham,
And where, in summer-time, a myriad ants explore
for jam,
And where the cockroach hath its lair, beneath grim
tins of fat—
Let be! The regulations deal with everything like
that.
What though young oysters, newly scalped, upon old
oyster-shells
Recline? What if the butter-dish in sweetness scarce
excels ?
What though the Dago maul new bread with rude,
microbey mits ?
Although on ware washed yesteryear the cheese of
ages sits
Droning the same old dirge of burial-day awaited
long ?
It s quite all right! You see, the regulations say
it’s wrong.
Smeared china, shady tablecloths and sluggish salad-
ing,
Wild kitchens all gummed up with what the chang-
ing seasons bring,
Frayed food, matured potato-peel, with cobwebs
high and low,
Soiled aprons underneath the stove, since some cooks
like ’em so,
Bacteria in the bread-bin, tame germs busy in the
grime?
Who cares? The regulations now protect us every
time 1

EXILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A queen am I.
My palace boasts a hundred carven rooms;
A chain of jewels clicks whene’er I move,
And they must fear me. . .even when they 10ve...
The smirking crew that pander for my smite.
And all the while
I long to lie
Hearing a bird-song buffetting the breeze
Or the Green Harper stealing through the trees
Face down, among the cool, wet violet blooms...

M. FORREST.
Art Society’s Exhibition.
This year s exhibition of cabinet pictures,
from the brushes of members of the Royal
Ait Society of New South Wales, was
opened to a breathless and impatient
public at the Pitt-street (Sydney)
rooms this week; and the solitary ex-
cuse for it that this*-* deponent can
discover is a portion of the water-color
department. A strong foundation of inter-
est and charm is built up there by Arthur
Burgess, Lister-Bister, Percy Spence, James
Lnsp, D. G. Reid, Chas. Tindall and J. A.
Bennett. But the oils section is as deplor-
able as the representations of truth and
honesty done by the hired liars of the anti-
Australia party. Burgess, with three marine
pictures of workman-like touch, makes most
or the others look like clumsy students,
iercy Spence obtains exemption from this
®P IDIOII with a phantasy which he has titled
Evensong of the Sea.” The face and
figure of the girl (presumably Davy Jones’s
most attractive choir lady) are painted with
eil n lC i skill* but the large, dead hunks of
rolled-up sea, also the uncompromising, tidy
bubbles, are so unsatisfactory as to call for
the services of.. a furniture-removing con-
tractor. James R. Jackson, too, puts a little
spirit into one or two of his small land-
scapes, but not enough to soften their unnat-
urai reserve. YY ith a few other minor excep-
tions the remainder of the work is crude,
with a particular weakness for falsity of
coloring. The difference of opinion, for
instance, as to the exact shade and amount
of washing blue employed when the waters
of 1 ort Jackson were mixed, is bewildering.
The most striking result in the exhibition
has been obtained by Burgess with the
water-color, “Pacific Shores.” It palpitates
with that spirit of the South Seas which
made even the bald-headed suburban readers
of Stevenson and Louis Becke regret the fate
that led them from a career of blackbirding,
treasure-seeking, pirating or plain devilry.
Off the low shore lies a white, silent, adven-
ture-hinting schooner. Along the inevitable
reef stretches the far line of lazy surf.
Between it and the white beach, the clear
water. Above and below the unforgettable
tropic blue of the sea and sky. And, impreg-
nating all, the heat haze of the sun-high
hour. The effect is striking, but a closer
appreciation of the work is impossible owing
to the disheartening light on that side of
the gallery. The same artist has two fine
pictures of the Australian war-ship Mel-
bourne, which are similarly handicapped.
Close by are Lister-Lister’s set of ’scapes,
each characteristically pleasing. There are
12 of them, which is a risk to take with
familiar goods on a dull market. In the
same locality a fine richness of color relieves
the otherwise Christmas-almanacky effect of
“The Rose,” by Percy Spence, and his talent
for color treatment is well matched by
another old hand, .T. A. Bennett, whose pair
of heads, “Esther” and “Nancy,” are most
pleasantly reproduced. And, of course,
there are specimens of James Crisp’s mag-
pies—no R.A.S. show would be complete
without them. Also, honorable mention
must be delivered to D. G. Reid and Chas.
Tindall. Others range from fair to medium,
with a downward tendency. In the black
and white section a couple of etchings
(“Steps, Gloucester Street,” for preference)
by Alfred Coffey stand out amongst a weak
lot. But the many failures of the exhibi-
tion are no excuse for not seeing the few
successes. Rather are they an urgent appeal
for a heap more encouragement—especially
from the unpatriotic Affluent.


A GREAT IDEA.
Now, turn to the typical Labor leader or other such demagogue of the so-called “advanced” or “progressive” sort. Is not the great secret of his success his facility
in the manufacture of political bogies, in which he persuades the unthinking workers to believe. —Melbourne Argus.
The Argus, walking abroad in profound meditation, has a brilliant idea. “Bless me soul, why ever didn’t I think of it afore?
I’ll accuse the Laborites of breeding bogies, so I will.”

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
ON HIS GUARD.
WAITRESS: “Bill of fare, sir?"
MULGA JIM: “I pays no bill till I gets my feed!”
“Ned McNicholl” : Can sympathise with
“Kimbolton” (B. 6/3/’l3) for cursing at mules.
Only knew one of them, but she taught me the
entire mule family’s box of tricks. She carried
more swags and more tucker from Bulloo Downs
than any BDI horse, and kept fat on nothing when
the horses were dying in “the corner.” She was old
when I knew her—old in years, older in sin—and her
name was Jenny (of course), and there’s not a
pack-horse cook that ever left Bulloo Downs for
Adelaide with Jones, Green and Sullivan cattle
that Jenny hasn’t kicked, bitten or otherwise mal-
treated. If all the language that has been hurled
. ~ , . j t A
at that animal were collected in one blaze it would
scorch the whiskers of the stars. Dunno whether
she is alive now, but, if she is, she is carrying
swags for Kidman; and if she is really and truly
dead (that is if a “mewil” ever does die) 4 I’ll bet
“Kim” two drinks that she’s kicking, biting and
making trouble for a phantom cook on one of
David Jones’s cattle camps.
“Ginger”: For “Hager” (B. 13/3/’l3) to
say that wheat-threshing is harder toil than chaff-
cutting is simply a method of directing public atten-
tion to his igr.orance and inexperience. Thresher
work is hotter and dustier, but easier, than chaff-
cutting, particularly where the elevators can be
lifted high enough to do away with the pitch-hole.
And if “Rager” humps his drum over Cooiamon
(N.S.W.) way, he’ll find the chaff-bag contains
more stitches than the Chapman sack of wheat. “L.
Soup” (same issue) writes with a local and limited
knowledge of the game. None, of the cutters quoted
by him (bar one) are in the “gun” class. Several
others get through from 600 bags a day upwards.
Mackey’s will run a thousand bags through in a
full day; and Chandler, Logan’s sewer, will sew
and stack that many. And there are others who
can do the same. I’ve followed the cutter in the
five States, and the Ganmain-Coolamon men are the
ringers of the Commonwealth. About those 27
stitches. If Logan, whom I’ve mentioned before, saw
his sewer turn out a bag with only 10 stitches and
two “lugs,” he’d bash the aforesaid sewer with a
boiled gohanna or something. But why wrangle
over a few stitches or a few bags either way, and
lose sight of the more important fact that the bag-
sewer does the solid yakker of two men for 10£
hours a day for the wages of one? It is up to some-
body to pass the cutter-boss an Irish whisper that
it is rank sweating, and that the way of the sweater
is distasteful to all good Australaian blokes, coves,
etc.
* * » *
“Konini” : Another historical record went
up in smoke recently at Gisborne (M.L.). This was
(or was claimed to be) the carved wooden bucket
used on the “big” canoe—presumably the Arawa- —
on the voyage from Hawaiki to what is now Maori-
land. If it was the genuine implement, it was no
doubt used to bail the canoe out when the craft
looked as though it was going to be en-
gulfed in “the steep descent where the
world ends.” All, of course, because of the
eternal woman. Tama-te-kapua, when he took
the Arawa away from Hawaiki, also took the wife
of one Ruaeo, an attention which somewhat jarred
Rua. The latter speedily got to work with some of his
devilments, and about the same time the same un-
canny things were set in motion by another gent,
aboard the canoe, whose wife had also strongly at-
tracted the tropical Tama. Between them the Arawa
was rushed into a whirlpool, so that the water was
almost instantly over the bows. It was the pitiful
crying of the women and children that saved the
party. The aggrieved tohunga aboard found his
heart softening to the wailing, wherefore he stood up
and spat on his hands, so to speak, and changed the
aspect of the heavens. The storm ceased, the canoe
was hauled out of the whirlpool by incantation, and
all sailed on peacefully to Aotea. That was only
one of the strange things that happened on the
big canoe, but it is not nearly so strange as the
saving of one of the buckets to be burned at Gis-
borne when a small house fired. I must admit that
that part of the business appears somewhat doubtful
to me.
“N. or M.”: Here’s another unusual way
of capturing fish, as told of Binghi by the late-
lamented Martin Cash, ex-bushranger, Van Diemen’s
Land, in his Memoirs. He relates that while he
was stock-keeping on the Hunter River (N.S.W.),
he saw the natives obtain a plentiful supply of
mullet, which were never known to bite at the
hook, in the following manner:—
They procure a quantity of the lignum vitae bark,
which they chop into shreds with their tomahawks;
they then dig a hole, in which they make a fire,
afterwards taking out the ashes and filling the hole
with the bark, placing a layer of ashes on the top.
After subjecting it to this process for about an
hQur they J tak e o ut the bark and put in into small
nets, with which they plunge into the waterholes,
an d in a few minutes the mullet appear on the sur-
face and are thrown out on the bank without the
slightest difficulty.
Has any Abo.-reader heard of this method being
employed, or did the Irishman with the financial
name imagine it ?
FISHING.
“What are yer fishing tor, mate?"
“ Oh, anything I can catch." (After a pause) "What are you?”
“Scrapiron”: I observe that “Cavalry-
man” comes back to his charge against the Aus-
tralian as a horseman, and tells “F. Brown” that
he (Brown) doesn’t know what he talks about.
Brown’s talk was to the effect that “Caval-
ryman” was a plumber. I’m with Brown ;
and on behalf of a number of bushmen here-
abouts (which is Somewhere Away to Blazes
out of Winton, N.Q.) I desire to tell the
said “Cavalryman” that his remarks are
rubbish, particularly when he says that on
sheep stations 90 p.c. of the inhabitants
never see a horse that a child couldn't ride.
He will be telling us next that he has seen
the monkey-dodgers mustering sheep in sul-
kies, as according to him the sheepman rides
mostly in buggies, sulkies or on bicycles.
Now, I am a sheepman, and have lived
among sheep, horses and cattle since I could
toddle, so I guess that I ought to know
something about the game. And if “Caval-
ryman” will saunter out here we will oblige
him with a mount a child can’t ride, but
which is, nevertheless, used to do station
work. I won’t say anything about the Eng-
lish fox-following riders because I’ve met
only two of them; but if they were a fair
sample of the fraternity, “Cavalryman” can
have my share of the lot when it comes to
really and truly riding. If these station
workers Outback aren’t horsemen, then I’m
afraid there are no horsemen left. We get
all sorts of blokes from Europe and Eng-
land, and some of them can ride a bit, I ad-
mit ; but I’ll bet a small bundle they would,
in their turn, be the first to admit how
much they can learn from the Australian
Billjim.
“Ginger” : My cobber Nugget is, like my-
self, a mere specimen of the plain, common or vege-
table variety of swagmen, but he is an artist in his
line. Here is a list of the articles Nugget rolls up
every morning into just a decent-sized swag: one 6 x
8 tent, one pair double blankets, two suits, one pair
trousers, one working hat, one cap, one pair boots,
one hair brush, one clothes do., one b’acking do.,
one tin cobra, two flannels, three pair socks, one
towel, six collars, four neckties, four fishing lines,
six cod hooks, one mosquito net, one writing pad,
one packet envelopes, one pen and ink, four photo-
graphs, one bundle letters, one bottle painkiller, one
needle case, one reel thread, two pipes, three candles,
one pair scissors, one box pills, four shirts, two
packets tape, one pillow, one razor, one shaving
brush, one camp mirror. He is adding thereto a
rug and a rain-proof macintosh. The commiss-
ariat department, divided into two bags (one over
each shoulder), consists of tea, sugar, flour, salt, one
flour bread-brownie, mutton, one tin pepper, one tin
curry, a few onions and spuds. A frying-pan, pint
and two billycans complete the outfit. I put the
clock on him the other morning, and he rolled up
the whole caravan in a tick under two' minutes. If
a woman can be found to cram the above list into
the same space I’m prepared to rat on the Labor
party and vote Vida Goldstein for the Senate.
“Chops and Steaks”: Our cow-cocky
friend could tell us something useful in this meat
versus vegetable controversy. The cow, a vegetarian,
grinds her food; she does practically no biting.
A BLOKE’S LUCK.
FIRST BEER CHEWER : “Money torks orlright.
Blokes like us never have a charust in this
world."
SECOND DITTO : “ That's Gord's truth, mister.
Now Urn the champeen beer drinker of
Orstralia, but I carn't get enuff beer to
prove it.”
The cocky friend will know that. Carnivorous dog, pn
the other hand, doesn’t grind at all. Simply because
he can’t. Man is intermediate between the cow and
the dog. His teeth are adapted for both actions —in-
cisors for cutting, molars for grinding. This alone is
sufficient proof of the fact that he was designed to
handle a mixed diet. Again, the amylolytic
(starch-splitting) ferment, ptyalin, found in human
saliva, is totally absent in herbivora. It’s no use
tooting individual cases of men waxing sinewy and
colossal on the spud-celery diet. • They’re mere
diddling deceptions. Of course, if a person’s com-
missariat somersaults at the sight of steak, his
only commonsense course is to turn vegetarian.
But to start preaching it as a doctrine for universal
application is quite another thing.
PHILOSOPHER CHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
None of these calamities would have happened had
we only been guarded by the precepts of Philosopher
Ching. —Pekin Gazette.
Why did we stray from the path that was straight,
Losing the ticket we held for the Gate?
Why did we marry the wrong sort of girl,
Getting our life (and our hair) out of curl?
Why did we drop into ways that were lax,
Wand’ring to Tophet by devious tracks?
Why did we sigh when existence should sing ?
Why did we turn a deaf ear unto Ching?
Where was he living and what was his caper?
When did he burn out his studious taper?
Was he in youth just a giddy young spark,
In for all mischief and out for a lark?
Did he make love in a voice that was fluty,
Swearing his almond eyes swam with her beauty?
Did he turn sage when he’d had a mad fling,
Or was he born Philosopher Ching?
Sooth, but I know not. Yet well had it been
Could we bring back the old man to the scene;
Cut off his pigtail (as China does now),
Gaze with respect on his deep-furrowed brow ;
Model our lives on the lines that he gave,
Worship our parents or weep on their grave ;
Drain from his chalice a draught of the spring
Whence came the wisdom that bubbled in Ching.
Had he been boss of the Council or Curia,
Ne’er had the White Devil gone with Manchuria ;
Had but the nous that was under his cap
Lighted our way, we had beaten the Jap ;
Had he but guided old Buddha Tzu-sche
Down her long journey, how happy were we!
Samisens joyful with ting-a-ling-ting
Ring out the praise of Philosopher Ching!
True that his precepts are shrouded in maziness ;
True, his career is beclouded in haziness;
Though he was reverenced so highly by most of ’em,
Reasons for worship we find not the ghost of ’em.
Still, had we lived by his “Counsels that Bless,”
What we had risen to no one can guess;
And you’ll admit that a doubt is a thing
No decent person could have about Ching!

TERRIBLE BURN ON PALM OF HAND.
“One night I struck a match and the whole box
went off in my hand, burning me across the palm,”
says Mr. J. R. Worseley, Margate (Tas.). “The pain
was awful. I went to the store and looked round for
something to relieve me. I saw Chamberlain’s Pain
Balm, and noticed the word ‘burns’ on the label.
I rubbed it on my hand, with the result that the
pain quickly disappeared and I was able to go to
sleep. In the morning I found the skin whole, and
the burn quickly healed without even leaving a
scar.”*

“Bro”: Old Pathrick Maguire lay dying,
and friends and relatives were assembled at his bed-
side to speed his soul with prayer. In the midst of
the devotions the dying man gave one deep groan,
sighed, then lay back on his pillow. In the com-
motion that ensued, Pathrick, jun., collapsed into
the capable arms of widow Mclnerny. Someone
promptly rushed for the bottle of stimulants and
held it to the fainting man’s lips. Then a feeble
voice whispered from the bed: “Be sure, Pathrick,
and lave a little dhrop for th’ mornin’!”

“F. M. Clements”: The “pigface” (Me-
sembryanthemum /Equilaterale) referred to by your
“L. 8.” (since dead) and “Coola” (B. 6/3/’l3) is
the goonah of the Hottentots and the canagong of
the Australian aborigine. It is also eaten as a kind
of spinach by the Maoris. It has slightly astringent
properties, and some varieties —especially M. Crys-
tallimim —are rich in soda. As goonah it is largely
used by the South African natives as a remedy for
sore throats, insect bites, abrasions and inflammatory
conditions generally. Such therapeutic value as it
possesses is principally due to the alkaline consti-
tuents.
FULLY EXPLAINED.
WARDER : “ What! Mean t ’ say y' never take
a bath?"
PRISONER : “I ain't been in gaol before!"
“Arm”: Of all the curious ways that
black and brown brother has of enticing fish into
the cupboard I have long ago concluded that lasso-
ing them is on its solitary. That’s how they catch
crayfish and prawns along the Kemp AVelch River,
Papua, using palm fibre for the lasso. It seems a
tedious and slow process, but if you saw a couple
of dozen youngsters fishing a pool you would be
surprised at the result. Another method is the use
of a creeper root to “poison” or stupefy the fish.
This root is crushed between stones and thrown into
the waterholes, where it emits a milky juice which,
mixing with the water, in an hour or so brings
every fish gasping to the surface, where the bre-
thren easily gather them in with a net not unlike
a butterfly-catcher, but made of spider's web instead
of cord.
GUARANTEED.
OLD LADY : “Do you think I can teach him to talk?”
BINGHI: “My word! Bimeby that pheller swear like a plurry trooper!"
“S.S.S.”: He was a wizened old canni-
bal, clad in a microscopic grass rami, and adorned
with strings of dogs’ teeth. Round his neck hung
a pendant that looked uncommonly like a man’s
hand. This son of Satan squatted on the plat-
form of an alligator-shaped rami, 60ft.
high and 150 ft. long, chewing betel and
occasionally licking his lime stick, and,
with insolent uninterestedness, scorning to
even glance at the white sinabada. The
dingy outer wall of the rami was over-
hung with hunting and fishing nets and
queer pig- and alligator-traps. In every
corner were heaps of bamboo knives and
bows and arrows. Groups of men and
youths, splendid in bird-of-paradise plumes
and tight, broad, bark belts, sat round
eating pig, stewed with bananas and sago,
from great wooden bowls passed up to
them through a hole in the floor by the
women underneath (for no native female
may enter a rami). Accidentally I brushed
against a fiendish-looking totum shield,
which fell with unnecessary noise and
struck the shoulder of the aged son of the
Devil’s wife. He glared at me over his
lime stick, and I caught the glitter of pre-
cious stones in its hilt. Through my
orderly boy I was permitted to inspect
this object. It was 12 inches of a human
thigh bone, the upper part carved to the
exquisite semblance of a beautiful woman’s
face, with emerald eyes (I wonder where
they got those emeralds?), and hundreds
of tiny hair plaits curled at the top, where
they passed through the bone and finished
off at the ends with minute rose-red shells.
The neck was faultlessly modelled and the
curve of the shoulders expressed complete
beauty. It was ivory-white at the face,
tinging to deep gold brown where the Son
of the Morning’s claws clasped it. I tried
unsuccessfully to trade that stick
for a brand-new tomahawk, a pair
of scissors, a 3ft. scrub knife, and, finally, all
three. The information was passed along that the
stick belonged to the ancient cannibal’s grandfather,
and if it lift the village the hill people would come
down and eat the tribe. It was a tough tribe, so
I pressed the matter no farther.
* * * *
“F.H.R.”: It isn’t necessary for me to
see a snake to know there’s one about. Time after
time I have felt a queer warning and stopped-
once with my foot poised over a black snake in the
moonlight; another time within a yard of a “tiger”
that I had no chance of seeing or hearing (I was
running at the time). Recently I was so sure of a
snake in the barn that I waited and got him next
day. I left home Monday morning recently, and
said to the wife, “You look out for a snake here.”
I work in the bush, and on Tuesday, after dinner
I had a bad attack of nerves. At every bit of
brown bark I ■ jumped. At four o’clock tea I told
my mate, who remarked that I would be unlikely
to see one that day, as it was late and rather cold.
However, I killed a big “carpet” before five o’clock,
and three miles away the wife killed another. This
is gospel. I can’t explain it. I only ask if others
have got the same sort of internal snake-forecasting
barometer.
“Eddyson” : Johnny Noall was dead. The
hearse was at the door, and practically the whole
adult population of Cup Cup was assembled on the
widow’s verandah, or in the parlor or the kitchen,
celebrating the occasion with whisky and water
and corned beef sandwiches. There was beer for
those rugged inhabitants whose grief called for a
larger bath. Presently it was noticed that a
stranger had intruded upon their sorrow. The per-
son who had butted into the ceremony was a small,
wiry female, in a shabby black hat and wearing
ostentatious crepe. She had a tiny, hard, dark eye,
like the head of a tin tack, and a sharp nose that
went about the place quickly and inquisitively.
She was very suggestive of a sniffing terrier. She
sniffed the whisky before taking a big nip, she
sniffed the sandwiches after attacking a four-storey
helping; then she sniffed at everything in sight, in-
cluding the bereaved relict of J. Noall. After all
of which she took some more whisky and another
seven layers of corned beef sandwich. At this
stage a relative intervened on behalf of the pro-
prietors. “Excuse me, madam,” he said, “but may
I ask who you are?” “I’m yirs. Noall, that’s who
I am!” retorted the female with sudden energy.
The relative endeavored to point out the lady’s
strange error, and make it clear to her that the
real widow was the stout lady crying in the corner;
but the unexpected guest wouldn’t hear of it. “She
Johnny Noall’s widder!” piped the invader. “Not
a bit of it, she ain’t! Johnny Noall was married
to me afore ever he seen her.” And as an emphatic
assertion of her authority the claimant seized, an-
other whisky. Efforts were made by relatives and
neighbors to hush up the scandal, but the new Mrs.
Noall was not the kind of person it was easy to
hush up. She got on the parlor table and started
to state her claim. “I’m Nell Noall,” she pro-
tested, “Johnny Noall’s legal, lawful, wedded
widder, none other genuine.” She produced a docu-
ment to establish her position, but nobody would
look at it, and Nellie was hustled out. But when
the funeral was about' to move, Sweet Nell was
found ensconced in the 'mourning coach. She was
ejected after an unseemly struggle, and then tried
to climb into Clark’s buggy. Driven back from
that, she elected to walk, and trotted behind the
hearse all the way to the cemetery. At the grave-
side she started in again to dispute the right of the
supposed widow to the alleged remains of the said
J. Noall, and produced her document again. It was
forgery and corruption and burglary, she said, to
rob a decent widder lady of her lawful corpse, and
she was so persistent that the presiding parson
consented to look into her proofs. The papers were
certainly authentic. Nellie produced a marriage
certificate which established her claim to one John
Noall. “He ’ad twin warts on his chin,” cried
Nellie. The late Johnny had two warts on his
chin. “One was a blue one,” asserted Nell, triumph-
antly. One of the lamented Noall’s warts was cer-
tainly a turquoise blue. Doubts and suspicions
beset the burial party, and after a brief consulta-
tion it was decided to open the coffin and allow
claimant to identify the remains. The coffin was
opened; the expectant widow stepped forward and
gazed on the face of the dead. Then, uttering the
poignant cry of a baffled hen, she turned on the
mourners with just anger. “Why, this ain’t ’im!”
she said. “This ain’t my Johnny Noall.” She
shook her fist at them. “Watcher mean by it?’’
she said. She gazed on deceased once more. “Not
a bit like ’im.” she moaned. “The blighter—’e’s
dodged me again!” Then Nellie went away. But
too late—everybody agreed she had quite spoiled the
funeral.
“Tea-Vea-Tea”: White Austrrlia and
Black Australia were engaged taking out the bottom
wire of the station boundary fence, preparatory to
putting in a small drain. They had rolled and rolled
till the roller was full, and still chains of “slack”
kept coming. W’hite Australia paused to mop off
sweat. “Gripes, Ben, the end uv this wire’s a hell-
uvatime cornin’!” he gasped. Black Australia glanced
suspiciously down the fence as an idea seemed to
hit him. “By cripe,” he grunted, “mine bin tinkit
some pfeller bin cut t’ plurry end off!”
Billy T. : D. McCool was, compara-
tively speaking, a hearty and happy man till his
wife started a boarding house. She might have
known what the result would be from Dan's be-
havior at harvesting time, when it was sometimes
necessary to lock him in the barn while the hands
were eating, so irritating was the spectacle to a
man of his frugal temperament. But the mines
started at Peewee, and Mrs. McCool saw what she
called “dollops” of money in it. She was right.
Within a month she had 30 boarders at a quid a
week, 33 per cent, of which was bunce. But the
sweet peace of mind of Daniel McCool was broken
for ever. The sight of 30 hungry men in full
action at table on Sunday drove him frantic. It was
bad enough on week days, when there were always
a number of men absent on day shift; but on Sun-
days the full strength of the company assailed the
victuals three times within 12 hours, and Dan's
powers of restraint were not equal to the occasion.
He would dance the length of the groaning board in
an ecstasy of apprehension, and eventually his agony
found expression. “For the love iv Hiven, Stacy,
have a little thought wid th’ mate, will yeh?”
“Davis, take some consideration fer th’ house, man.”
“Aisy wid th’ sugar, Squires!” “Anderson, lave
some duff for th’ weemin!” It might be supposed
that this sort of thing would drive boarders head-
long from the house; in reality, it spurred Mrs.
McCool’s paying guests to more desperate fights
with the viands. Mrs. McCool did them well, and
Dan’s acrobatics and mental agony became a much
appreciated comic-relief. The diners were disap-
pointed if he did not perform, and “Lave some for the
weemin!” was a cant term in all the mines at Pee-
wee. Mrs. Mac and her two stout daughters tried
their old device of locking Dan in the barn at din-
ner hours, but Dan performed like a ravening lion
behind his bars, and the boarders raised such strenu-
ous objection to the deprivation that McCool had
to be loosed again. He would stand at the head of
the table, pale and tremulous, and shout piteous ap-
peals or angry expostulations at the energetic feeders
as he saw the too, too solid flesh melt, and the piled
vegetables fade away, and “Lave some for the wee-
min! Mercy Gcd, lave some for the weemin!” was
the ever-recurring refrain of his intolerable lament.
It was a good joke while it lasted, but it did not
last long. The climax was sudden, dramatic and
full of action. It came along at Sunday’s dinner.
McCool had been bewailing and threatening with
even more than his customary vehemence. During
the pudding course he dashed from the room. When
he reappeared, a minute later, he had a gun.
“Dogs! dogs!” he screamed, “’atin’ a man out iv
house ’nd home!” and fired into the thick of the
startled feeders. The first shot broke Anderson’s
arm, the second smashed a sauce bowl. Then, roar-
ing like an animal, McCool got at them with the
butt of his gun. He gave Squires concussion of the
brain, knocked six of Hoadley’s teeth in, and dislo-
cated Trouson’s collar-bone. The survivors bore
poor Dan down, and secured him after a long fight
in which the tip of Davis’s finger was bitten off.
The police took McCool to Ballarat, and a lunatic
asylum swallowed him. Probably he is there yet.
His delusion was that he was being eaten alive by
wild boarders.

mond River, near Casino.— News item.

“Te Babarantiko”: The people of the
Pacific races have unlovely voices, but it is surpris-
ing what excellent “time” they keep. Practically
all of them are enthusiastic singers and dancers.
When the dancing mania is on him, which is nearly
always, the native squats in his house, chanting his
monotonous dance-song, keeping time with slaps on
chest, thighs, palms, and with gestures. Before they
can really speak the children do the same thing, and
the old crone chants on the brink of the grave. A
hundred men, and as many women, may take part
in a dance, and the slap with the flat of the hand
on the naked chest sounds as one crash, while the
stamp of 200 feet thunders like the stamp of a soli-
tary giant. But apart from this ear for “time,
the Pacific Islanders are not musical, or native-made
instruments would be more generally found. Where
they are found it is wise for the tourist to side-step.
THE ESPOUSAL OF THE CAVE WOMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To win as mine some hugely splendid woman,
Some woman breasted deeply, broadly thighed,
Moulded and mighty-limbed, of love defiant,
Large, savage-lipped, long-haired and fiery-eyed.
To steal upon her, bathing at the river,
Stalking her from my cover unawares,
Bellying along to tree and rock and hillock,
Knowing that all is lost me if she hears.
To close upon her till the waters, slipping
In silver tumult down her gleaming sides,
Show drop by drop distinctly.... then the onrush
Across the space that her and me divides.
Startled, she splashes through the water shallows,
Rustling the swaying reed-beds in her haste,
But swifter far, I leap upon and seize her
Around the curved delighting of her waist.
We fall and grapple in the ooze together,
Her teeth and nails are tearing at my heart,
But quick I lock my throttling, greedy fingers
Around her neck and force the jaws apart.
Now is she mine! And, struggling on my shoulder,
I bear her, till she struggles less and less ;
Then all her struggle ceases. And so I loose her.
She does not seek to flee my hot caress.
She licks my bloodied wounds, her soft tongue
stirring ;
Nor any boon I ask will be denied:
Her eyes are gentled as she looks upon me....
Up to my cave she goes, my happy bride.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
‘Abbey” Dangar, of Baroona, Singleton
(N.S. vv.), who died on Saturday, was the
fourth son of Henry Dangar, who came to
A. S. Wales in 1822, and was employed as
an assistant Government surveyor. This
original Dangar had five sons and two daugh-
ters. The sons were W. J. Dangar, who died
in 1890; Henry Carey Dangar, of Macleay-
street, who will be 83 on June 4; F. H.
Dangar, of London, who will be 82 in Octo-
ber ; A. A. Dangar, who died on Saturday
(he was born in 1840) ; and Francis Richard
Dangar, who died unmarried. The girls
married Walter Lamb, of Rooty Hill, and
G. F. Want, of Sydney. The four elder
brothers had 130,000 acres on the Gwydir.
A. A. Dangar, in addition to his share in
that estate, had 53,000 acres of his own in
Queensland. A part of the Baroona pro-
perty (A. A. Dangar’s own) is Castle Forbes,
owned in the _ ’3o’s by the notorious Major
Mudie, an aristocrat of his day and gener-
ation, and about the most strenuous convict-
flogger of the period.
“Dahn” Fisher (otherwise the Hon. F. M.
B. Fisher, Minister of Customs, Marine and
in Charge of the Government Printing Office
of Maoriland, at present a visitor to Aus-
tralia) is a son of that great personal force
in Wellington’s life, “Our George”—comp.,
reporter, mayor, M.P. and Cabinet Minister
under “Stockwhip” Atkinson. “Dahn”
Fisher, whose people came from Ireland, had
no fewer than three uncles who were comps ;
one of these (in Australia) and his father
being “whips” at the type-setter’s trade,
loung Fisher is keen to emulate the
achievement of his father, by tackling
a revision of the tariff. He has been
breaking himself in during the past
three months by assiduously inspecting fac-
tories up and down M.L. and meeting groups
of manufacturers. He and the boot people
found each other a tough proposition. There
was Smith, the manufacturer, fighting for a
high tariff to protect his trade, and there
was the same Smith, the importer, urging
Fisher to grant freetrade in footwear. It is
reported that “Dahn,” with his dazzling
smile, satisfied both Smiths.
The External Affairs Department recently
informed Hop Poon Gooey (the Chow who
has been so much in the public eye for the
last two years) that in a fortnight from date
of writing the time would be ripe for his
frequently-interesting missus to leave this
country. Whereupon the Argus announced
that “Mr. Poon Gooey was upset at the
hurried intimation of the Department, and
the short notice allowed to make all arrange-
ments for the departure of his wife.” As
an example of “hide” this takes the biscuit.
Mrs. Gooey was allowed to visit this count-
try in 1910 under a six-months’ exemption.
On the ground of ill-health an extension of
time was granted, whereupon the lady
promptly became “interesting.” Heeding
the blither of the Argus and other barrack-
ers for a piebald Australia, Josiah Thomas
extended the time allowance by another
three months. The next gag was that,
owing to the Chow revolution, Mrs. Gooey’s
life would be in danger if she returned to the
home of her fathers. So Thomas granted
yet another six months’ grace. Before this
was up the industrious lady succeeded in
becoming “interesting” some more. This
time Thomas summoned up all his determin-
ation (which doesn’t amount to much) and
said that Mrs. Gooey must go as soon as a
doctor certified that she was fit to travel.
The medico did this in February last, and
Gooey was informed by the Department that
the date of his wife’s departure had been
fixed for April 10. At the end of March,
when asked what arrangements he had made
for the voyage, the Mongolian intimated,
with a smile that was child-like and bland,
that he was horribly upset at the “hurried
intimation” and “short notice.” Also, he
procured a medical certificate to the effect
that his elder infant was unfit to travel ;
but Josiah’s ultimatum gives no heed to this
final strategic move.
An atmosphere of gloom and disapproval
brooded over the High Court last week when
Justice Powers took his seat there. The bar
stayed away with enthusiasm and unan-
imity, and no congratulations were forthcom-
ing from anywhere. The new Judge must
have felt something like Oscar Wilde’s “Sir
Mathew Ileid. President of the Royal Col-
lege of Physicians,” on the latter’s first visit
as a member to the Buckingham Club. Sir
Mathew was elected “in mistake for some-
body else; a contretemps that so enraged the
committee that when the real man came up
they blackballed him unanimously.”
Once more “ Jeames” :
The most notable feature of the late Pierpont
Morgan was his nose. It somewhat resembled the
proboscis which Coquelin used to build on to his
tace in the r6le of Cyrano de Bergerac. The chief
difference lay in the fact that Pierpont’s was more
purple and crenellated, and generally outrageous-
looking. It bulged like a small ballooji at the end,
and gave to his naturally small eyes a curiously pig-
like, expression. I used to see him every morning in
1 aris, years ago, buying a button-hole in a shop in
the Rue de la Paix. In those days it was said that
he was prepared to give half a million sterling to
anyone who would make his nose like that of
a normal man. The yarn may have been a lie.
Nevertheless, hundreds of people squandered hours
brooding over ways and means to repair the great
financier’s countenance. A doctor once said to me,
‘Why, I could fix him up with a few apnlications
of radium. in no time.” I maintained a civil silence,
but disbelieved him. There are some things that no
human being will endure if it is in the power of the
medical profession to free him from them, and one
is the sort of nose with which Morgan was afflicted.
CASEY,

V. R. C.
“11. H.” : In a way the passing out of Pier-
pont Morgan, the great American capitalist,
was pathetic. It was a case of a multi-
millionaire dying of hunger. He had enough
money to buy half the food on earth, but he
hadn t anywhere about his clothes, or his
banks, or his trust companies, or his safe de-
posits, the price of a new stomach. And the
solitary old stomach had been so neglected
in the process of money-making that it had
lost its punch. Consequently its owner lost
his paunch. Morgan would probably have
given the value of a small kingdom for two
or three pounds weight of fresh innards, but
they were almost the only things he couldn’t
buy.
The Oldest Inhabitant on some Oldest

Apropos the “eviction” from Sydney Government
H ° u ® e ? ? Be . e a P° rtra it of Mr. Arthur Macarthur
published _ with this footnote: “Leader of the move-
ment against the eviction of the Governor-General.
An ancestor of Mr. Macarthur, by the wav, took a
leading part in evicting Governor Bligh 'with the
aid of an armed force.” As a matter of fact, John
Macarthur, who took the “leading part” alluded to,
left no male descendant bearing his name. He had
four sons. _ One only of them married, and his
family consisted of but one daughter, who married
Captain Opslow, R.N. The McArthurs of the Wil-
liam McMillan rag firm are not connected with the
Camden Park people.
Neil Stewart, alleged to be the oldest in-
habitant of Parramattta, Australia’s oldest
settlement outside Sydney, died the other
day, aged 92. In the first roaring J so’s he
was a gold commissioner at Bathurst, a place
which roared a good deal at that period.
John Lee, who for 66 years had lived in
the Maitland (N.S.W.) district, died a few
days ago. aged 79 years. He was the son of
an old Peninsular warrior who settled and
died at Parramatta. The warrior’s eldest
son, Benjamin, is now climbing up the ’Bo’s.
Ben was member for Maitland at one time,
and is remembered for a, famous scrap on the
/mi 1 " the House with another member.
(These were the days when big members
picked up small ones and threw them bodily
at the Speaker.) He was afterwards P.M.
at Bathurst, and for a while S.M. at the
Water Police Court, Sydney. Dismal Lee,
ex-Minister for Works, is a younger brother
New Chief Rabbi Hertz, head of English-
speaking Jewry, is only 41. He is a Hun-
garian, but was taken to America in his
12th year. After becoming a rabbi there he
transferred to Johannesburg, whence he was
expelled by Kruger. That got him the ear
of Milner, who is credited with a share in
making him Chief Rabbi.
Sometimes the centenarian business is
overdone. Thus Richard Blood, of Jack-
son’s Swamp, near Bathurst (N.S.W.), died
last Saturday at the age of 110. It only re-
quired the addition of another cypher and
R. Blood would have clearly remembered
how Egbert won the Dattle of IJengestdown.
And with another cypher he would have
remembered Chaos.
Everyone has his secret ambition. N.S.W.
Attorney-General Holman’s is not to be
Agent-General or Premier of the State, but
to shine in the British Parliament. Holman
was born a Londoner, and will probably die
one.. He acquired his Socialistic views as a
disciple of William Morris, who used to lec-
ture at street corners. His parents, both of
whom were members of the Brough-Bouci-
cault comedy co.. brought him to Australia
in his precocious teens.
That fine judge of a good meal, ex-Judge
Casey, died at St. Ivilda (Vic.) on Satur-
day. The old man —he lived to 82 —packed
a lot of things into his life. In the davs
when lie was a whirling figure in Vic. politics
—though he even then aimed at being some-
thing of a fashion-plate—there was a gag
to the effect that he had been a policeman
in America. In his first years in Victoria,
at the time of the gold rushes, he helped
Angus Mackay to own the Bendigo Adver-
tiser ; and from that he climbed into Par-
liament, and was Minister for Justice in
McCulloch’s second team, with Gorge
Higinbotham for a colleague. He was also
a vigorous Lands Minister under Francis—-
with his partner, Angus Mackay, at the
Lands Department. Then, pushed out of
Parliament, and hankering for a stiddy job,
he engineered himself on to the County
Court bench in 1884, and what he didn’t
know of law he made up for in his know-
ledge of men and things. Retiring about
10 years ago, he spent his old age mostly in
samnling the food of different countries. No
man knew more of the prog of the universe
than Casey.
A. A. (“Abbey”) Dangar, the N.S.W.
squatter who died last week, was one of the
little group of Singleton people whom the
big Cobar mine enriched. The business
started with the two Longworth brothers,
who worked a little local coal-mine and made
coke. They couldn’t get anybody to buv the
coke, so they decided to try to get hold of a
mine themselves and use their own coke in
smelting the ore. Cobar was abandoned, and
they got hold of that. Gould, the local soli-
citor, was in the business with them. When
they wanted more money, they went to
Dangar, the local rich man, and Dr. Read ;
and this lot constituted the Cobar Syndicate
which made big profits for 12 years and then
sold the whole concern for about half a
million.
THE BETRAYAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Millionaire Pierpont Morgan died at Rome from
acute indigestion. —News item.
The rich man owned a princely paunch,
In keeping with his place;
He nourished it and held it dear ;
It grew in beauty year by year,
And with his wealth kept pace!
A symbol of his sov’reignty,
The hall-mark of his caste,
He treated it with tender care,
Yea, lined it well with viands rare,
And loved it to the last.
Its sleekness and its rounded grace
He conned with lofty pride.
But in the end the pampered thing
Attacked its kind, indulgent king—-
And then the rich man died!

HARRISON O.
Octogenarian Smythe.
A Bulletin man who knows him well
speaks a piece:—
R. S. Smythe, whose score now stands at 80 (not
out), is probably the oldest journalist and impres-
ario in Australasia. Certainly, he is the most
widely-known public identity who has figured in
both capacities. As a professional penman he closed
his notebook when he returned to Melbourne from
“The Much - Travelled” (R. S. SMYTHE).
his first visit to America in 1876 (after acting as
special correspondent for four or five newspapers at

(An old Phil May sketch.)
a Deniliquin weekly, the Southern Courier, in op-
position to a scandalously democratic rag, called the
Pastoral Times, their cnoice of editor fell upon young
R.S.S. Those bloated capitalists paid him £l2 a
week to check the country’s headlong descent to the
D- 1, and for nearly a year Smythe earned his
salary. Then he broke away again and resumed the
managerial burden. His travels and troubles began.
He took Dr. Lynn, the conjurer, and a small concert
company for a five years’ tour in the ’6o’s of last
century, visiting countries where the hoof of white
showman had never yet trod. Japan, the treaty
ports of China, Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Mauri-
tius, India from end to end ; and South Africa sent
forth audiences to welcome the invading show
Smythe included even St. Helena in that record-
breaking five years’ experience, from which he de-
rived his title of “The Much Travelled.” He was
the first manager to cross the Orange River in
S Africa with a professional co, Smythe tells a
story of how, standing at the inner door of the local
hall, which he had hired for his ungodly enterprise,
he held out his hand to receive the ticket or cash
of a tall, hairy Dopper, who had come late to the
show. Brother Boer, under the impression that it
was a revival meeting, and that all were welcome,
shook Smythe’s outstretched hand with Christian
cordiality, and passed himself into the back seats.
The Much Travelled returned to London, and made
himself acquainted with Europe, He was still a
journalist when he was not engaged in money-
making. In 1868 he contributed to the Pall Mall
Gazette, and wrote an article or two for the Corn-
hill, and for some time afterwards he supplied some
of the Occasional Notes for that magazine. No show-
man had a wider knowledge of newspaper offices. It
was once said of R. S. Smythe that he was person-
ally known to every editor of any importance from
i okohama to Capetown. To his capacity for writing
smart paragraphs and articles in advertisement of
his business and for getting them readily published,
a lot of his success was due. He was his own press
agent, and the best of press agents at that. Thus,
he was able to establish the “lecture platform” in
this country, and to make a speciality of importing
stars’’ from Europe or America. His name became
identified with the business that is now carried on
in a milder form, by his son, Carlisle Smythe.
Robert Heller, a clever conjuror and remarkably
fine pianist, was one of his earliest importations.
Arabella Goddard, the hardest and loudest woman
pianist of her period, was an early concert “star,”
an “ o Up c to tbe tllne of . Santley’s visit, and later,
R.S.S. figured as the principal concert-runner here-
abouts. He was the first to engage Paderewski, but
file contract was broken, and the long-haired Pole
eventually came to Australia under other manage-
ment. The first lecturer whom Smythe boomed into
notoriety was the Melbourne parson, Charles Clarke.
Lecturing was popularised by the silver-haired Rev.
Charles, and after he had returned to England on
his own, he came back to Australia several times
under engagement to his original manager. But the
most remarkable of Smythe’s early successes with a
one-man entertainment, was the' tour of Richard
Proctor, the astronomer, who talked about the firma-
ment to crowded audiences wherever he went. A
showman who could work up a hysteria of intelli-
gent public interest in the lectures of a scientist,
must have been a master of his craft. His manner
of exploiting Proctor gave Smvthe the first call on
celebrities, who could be tempted to make the long
trip to Australia. Some of these had a magnetic
name, and were comparatively easv to work. Archi-
ed J° rbes > Geor £ e Augustus Sala, H. M. Stanley
(the discoverer” of Livingstone), Max O’Rell, Mark
twain and Talmage (the Yankee preacher) came to
a c ' olm * r ' V that wanted to see and hear them for
their notoriety’s sake. Such less-known persons as
Rev. Haweis (the apostle of music), Harry Furniss
(the London Punch artist), Miss Von Finkelstein
(the 6ft. ladv who yarned about the Holy Land)
and Rev. Haskett Smith (one of the most interesting
and educational of Smvthe’s long line of platform
talkers) were not celebrities outside of literary circles.
They needed all the local notoriety that ' the old
hand could attach to them in order to make them
. e mana ?' er ’ s name was a guarantee of bright
>" their lectures. They were accepted on the
R.S.S. label, and the tiublic never complained of the
goods. R S. Smythe’s Reminiscences of the Remarkable
People he has piloted around Australasia, and
the others with whom he has foregathered whilst at-
tempting to get into closer business relations with
them, would make an attractive volume. He has
outlived every one of his biggest attractions. Their
celebrity is now so clouded o’er with “memories of
later years,” that the announcement of Smythe’s
80th birthday came to middle-aged readers as a
sudden reminder of the many famous names the
clever old showman has handled in his time. As
for the younger generation, the lecture platform can
go to rot for all it cares. It knows not Smythe, nor
is m the least respected by him. At the age of four
score years he has earned the right to think that
public taste,. in forms of entertainment, is losing
its last vestige of craving for education.

N. S. Wales finances get madder and
madder. In the first nine months of the last finan-
cial year the expenditure exceeded the revenue by
£368,201; in the first nine months of this financial
year the excess is £1,731,756. Every week or two
Cann, who is understood to be Treasurer, announces
that he has put the peg in; but while there is a
penny to be had his spendthrift colleagues are going
to have it, and Cann doesn’t count. This is how the
whole matter stands:—
Revenue £11,407,156
Expenditure—-
Revenue account . . £13,598,976
Works Fund . . . . 685,931
Closer Settlement Fund 46,729
Loan account . . . . 6,889,696
21,221,332
Excess of Expenditure over Income .. £9,814,176
That is for nine months. Of every £lOO spent dur-
ing that period, no less than £46 6s. has been raised
on the State’s I 0 U’s; and we shall have to pay
those I O U’s some day—and the chances are that the
payment will come due when we are far more hard-
up than we are at this moment. Meantime, we shall
have to pay as much as £4 7s. p.c. interest for the
money. Money, in fact, is so scarce and dear that
private people with business instincts and training
are borrowing no more than they are forced to; they
know that for many years past there hasn’t been a
more unfavorable time to borrow. But the fools or
rogues who are running N. S. Wales and ruining the
Labor cause at the same time, branding the party’s
administration as the wildest and most extravagant
on record, pay no heed to such considerations.
And we are undoubtedly in the backwash already.
The N.S.W. March revenue was certainly £19,982
ahead of last year’s; but there was £40,563 less
from taxation, and the £60,545 more which the
business undertakings brought in is simply due to
the boom trade that results from the current squan-
dering of millions of borrowed money. And, anyhow,
there is another £350,000 or so of interest to be
earned—or owed—this year. Victoria shows pre-
cisely the same sagging in the middle. Its nine
months’ revenue has been £6,904,716, as against
£7,025,312 in the corresponding three quarters of
last year—a shrinkage of £120,596. Loan and
other expenditure figures from that quarter are not
available. S. Aus. has got in £3,190,475, as against
£3,166,755 ; but the Broken Hill trouble will send
the figures for the current quarter to pieces. Loan
figures are never mentioned in S. Aus. ; in fact, the
average S. Australian, who has been told that his
surpluses go to reduce the public debt, has a vague
idea that he doesn’t owe anything worth mentioning.
What he does owe is. about £9O per head—twice as
much as the Victorian, and more than any other
State in the Commonwealth ; more, indeed, than any
other discoverable State in the world.
Queensland collected £4,417,570, or £193,534
more than in the same three-quarters of the previous
year; but the expenditure was £4,173,350, or
£413,141 more; and that shows the same old wild
rush of the Gadarene swine down the steep place.
On the other hand, Loan expenditure, though still
far too large, was £567,927 less; the nine months’
total was £1,868,957. Westralia continues to suffer
from the common microbe: Revenue, £3,099,143;
expenditure, £3,374,527. Certainly, Westralia has
to charge itself with various sinking-fund contribu-
tions. In other words, it is borrowing to pay either
its sinking fund or its interest, and if ever a confi-
dence trick was played on Cohen that is one. Loan
expenditure is also never mentioned in the West—
except when the Auditor-General throws his report
on the table, and casually mentions that the meals
bought for immigrants on arrival are included among
the permanent and reproductive works charged to
this account. Finally, Tasmania, thanks mainly to
the special Commonwealth subsidy and the boom in
the metal markets, has shown up better with a
revenue of £882,773, as against £795,422 in the
first three quarters of the previous year ; and when
an improvement is due to a Commonwealth dole and
a sky-rocketing rise in the metal markets, it isn’t
much to give three cheers about.
* * * *
An important development is likely to
occur shortly in connection with the floating of loans
by the Australasian States. Hitherto it has been
the practice for the Agent-General of a State to
initiate all financial negotiations with the stock-
broking firm which for years has represented the
Australian States and Maoriland on the London
Exchange. A few years ago this issuing house,
Robert Nivison and Co., took into partnership Robert
Smith, who was official stockbroker to the Govern-
ment of India. Then an arrangement was made
whereby Nivison and Co. acted as financial agents
for the Dominion of Canada and its brokers. Thus
the greater portion of the debenture issues of Canada,
India, Australia and Maoriland, and most of the
loans of the Crown colonies and dependencies, are
now floated by one firm, having a close connection
not only with the recognised underwriters on the
London Stock Exchange, but also with the numerous
banks, discount cos., bill brokers and other private
cos., firms and individuals that habituallv indulge
in underwriting as a pleasant and profitable pastime
when the securities are doubly gilt-edsred. The accu-
mulated wealth behind this congeries of underwriters
is vast. Every loan recommended by R. Nivison and
Co. goes through whether the public comes in or
not. The public . nowadays rarely applies direct
for much of a colonial loan. In London nearly every-
thing in the nature of investment of capital is done
through one’s banker rather than through one’s
broker. The banker collects the anplications from
his clients and passes them on to the bank’s stock-
brokers, and they divide the brokerage. The bank,
being usually an underwriter, is quite prepared to
take up its underwritten portion of the issue. It has
daily applications from its customers for sound securi-
ties, and .it . thus, peddles off the new loan. Now.
however, it is quite likely that the experiment will
be made of handing a couple of Australian loans to
two London-Australian stockbroking firms, who have
so far been closely identified with Australian mining
scrip. Should these firms, whose rise to wealth has
been sensational, decide to become issuing houses,
they will compete for the honor, and incidentally the
profit, of floating all Australian and M.L. loans ; and
it can scarcely do harm, and most likely will work
for the public benefit, if these two Melbourne firms
co-operate to create a new underwriting group in
London. There will be only one drawback to success.
None of them speak Scotch, and their noses are only
of moderate size.

The capital is £40,000 in 7 p.c. cumulative pref.
shares and £122,591 in ordinaries. Of the pref.
shares 27,500 went to the pref. holders in the original
private co., 10,000 were subsequently issued at a
premium and 2500 were allotted to the emplovees'
provident fund. Goodwill accounts for no less than
£65,702 of the capital:—

Rooke and Co.’s business (Melb.) .. 20,’000

Total . . . . £65,702
Reserves amount to £61,620, so there are now
tangible assets to represent practically all the capi-
tal. In a year or two the balance-sheet should be
cleaned up by wiping off the paper item entirely. A
few other things might be wiped off at the same
time. “Catalogues, stationery, prepayments, invest-
ments, etc., £3414,” isn’t, for instance, presentable
enough for the company it is in. Besides the visible
goodwill item there is another of a sort represented
by a payment on profits to be made to the three
“Wunderlich brothers who constitute the head office
Board. As managing or permanent directors they are
entitled to 5 p.c. of the net profits after the prefs.
have taken out 7 p.c. and the ordinaries 6 p.c., with
something more on the profits in excess of £lO,OOO.
This bonus amounts to more than the pref. dividend.
The pref. div. is, however, small. If the co.’s profit
was cut down by one-half, there would still be
enough, after feeding the prefs., to pay the ordinaries
10 p.c. and lay a fairly respectable amount by.
Whichever way you approach it the thing looks very
good indeed. There is a cumulative pref. div., cer-
tainly; but it can call for only £2BOO a year. There
is a cut by the managing directors; but it doesn’t
start till the ordinaries have had 6 p.c. There is a
big goodwill item; but just about enough surplus
profits have been accumulated in five years to wipe it
out. The trade has evidently grown very rapidly,
yet there are no liabilities whatever; on the other
hand, £60,564 of the capital (total, £162,591) is
in freehold lands and buildings and £41,287 is in
book debts (less reserve) and cash. And though
there has been a building boom of late, and though
under normal conditions the co. would get neither so
much business nor such prices, profits, as mentioned
before, could fall 50 p.c. and still show 7 p.c. to
prefs. and 10 p.c. to ordinaries. That they are quite
capable of falling with a nasty thud seems to be sug-
gested by the earlier figures in the table, though in
running the eye down the Profit column it should be
noted that until 1910 the co. made up its accounts
half-yearly.

The object of the management seems to be to make
one part at least of its accounts as unintelligible as
possible. It succeeds admirably. Six months ago,
after paying the 6 p.c. div. on" pref. shares, £3308
was appropriated in a lump to pay “div. at 10 p.c.
p.a. on ordinary shares and bonus to present holders
of ord. and pref. shares of Is. in the £ on dividends
paid during 1911.” Possibly the object of the
bonus (which, after all, amounted to less than p.c.
all round) was to provide shareholders with their in-
come tax; but it was a slummocky wav of doing it.
Now, after paying 6 p.c. p.a. on pref. shares and 10
p.c. p.a. on ordinaries, a bonus of 20 p.c. is to be paid
this month on ordinaries; the money, or some of it,
to be applied to the payment of calls on shares not
fully paid. The notice runs this way: “Where a
shareholder holds fully-paid ordinary as well as con-
tributing shares, such bonus shall be credited as
capital on his or her contributing shares to the
extent of 125.. on each share.” There are 60,000
fully-paid ordinaries and 20,000 ordinaries paid
to 2s. Apparently the directors mean that, out
of any sum payable to a shareholder, there may be
applied to capital so much as shall pay the now
partly-paid shares up to a maximum of 125., any bal-
ance to be paid to the shareholder in cash. The re-
sult, seemingly, will be that contributing shares will
be paid up to all sorts of amounts —which will be
more untidiness.
According to the Profit and Loss account, the
net profits are smaller than those shown in the table.
The balance is made up of amounts dropped into the
reserve fund. This shows how:—-

P. & L. Additions to

Dec., 1912.. .. 8618 4699
That reserve fund now amounts to £34,000; and it
is out of it that the bonus is to be paid. The fund
is, presumably, a reserve to protect the big asset
which consists of time-payment debts. All the assets
are raked into two heaps:—
Property, Stock, Sundry
Fittings, etc. Debtors.

June, 1912.. .. 75,454 89,148
Dec., 1912.. .. 80,995 103’491
The sundry debtors—presumably time-payment debts
—are growing fast, and, though the capital has been
gradually increased until it now stands at £81,963,
the co. has had to get accommodation to the extent
of £24,664, besides the £34,350 owing on mort-
gage. Prima facie, the person who buys on time-
payment hasn’t the available resources to pay cash,
and it would look like risky business to supply him’
But the strength of a concern of this kind lies in its
means of finding out the bad marks beforehand ; also
the debt is being constantly reduced, and the further it
is reduced the less likely is a “hire-purchaser” to
renege and lose the goods and his instalments into
the bargain. This brand of trading, if the manage-
ment is good, therefore produces far fewer bad debts
than might be expected. But if there were a sudden
slump, the co. would no doubt be landed with a
heap of returned second-hand goods; also, trade
wouid certainty go to pieces. For it is a weird
tact that, whether it be Government or individual,
the tendency is to borrow harder and go more furi-
ously into debt in good times when earnings are high,
than in bad times when work is scarce and wages
poor.

The agent of the big co. picks up side-lines as he
goes along; and, since the big co. doing numerous
lines can afford to paste its agents all over the coun-
try, the little co. doing only the odd jobs finds its
row getting harder and harder. Hence, a little over
12 months ago this co.- —which bought out a still
smaller one some years back—decided to go into
more general business, and set its agents talking
fires and accidents and burglars, as well as horses
and other cattle. The capital at that time was only
£6414, in 25,658 shares fully paid to ‘ss. Another
24,342 were offered and taken, Is. apiece being paid
on them. During the year nearly £lOOO has been
spent in organising the new departments ; hence the
diminished profit. So far there is nothing much to
show for the outlay in the shape of increased pre-
miums; the income from policies in 1911 was
£12,504, and in 1912 £12,694. It is too early
yet, though, to draw conclusions. The capital isn’t
imposing enough to hit the average insurer very
hard; but the funds are quite large enough to carry
the present volume of business and a bit more. And
there is no doubt about the quality of those funds ;
with the exception of a trifle of furniture and sun-
dries and £648 of secured advances, the whole lot is
in deposits and cash.

To temper the Polar blast to the closely-cropped
lambs, the dreadfully eloquent directors promise that
in about six months, when the co.’s new premises are
opened, “a return to profitability should be experi-
enced.” A few years back the directors (there are
nine of them) found sales so sick that they decided
that, unless a member spent at least £l2 per annum
at the stores, £1 of his capital would be deducted.
That explains the “forfeited capital.” The visible
result has been to nominally reduce the deficit; pro-
bably another result has been to embitter a crowd
of small customers who weren’t large customers
simply because, instead of nutting the available cash
into stock, the directors dashed it into out-of-the-way
city property. The directors’ report, anyhow, still
makes sad reading: “The sales at head stores fell
from £50,029 for the half-year to January, ’l2, to
£40,412 for the half-year to January, T 3. The loss
at the bakery (£275) The loss on the sale of
drapery stock ( £300) . . . . law costs in appeal case
(£300)....” And a promise of further losses next
half-year is helc( out. During the past six months
the before-mentioned out-of-the-way head stores were
sold for £28,000 (just under book value), and ten-
ders have been called for the erection of more cen-
tral premises, where the directors hope to chase the
nimble shilling with more success. The co. in the
previous half-year also got rid of its drapery stock
for £6269, the loss ( £300) being debited to this
half-year. Although the head store’s sales shrank,
both the Williamstown branch and the bakery show
increases; but only the Williamstown store shows a
profit ( £54). Higher wages, increased price of
flour, etc., are blamed for the bakery’s failure. For
the six months to June, 1912, the sales were £11,508
and the profit £344. To January, 1913, the sales
had risen to £14,885, yet a loss of £275 is shown.
As a matter of fact, the whole bakery enterprise
was ill-conceived from a business point of view. The
bakery appealed to hardly anybody outside the
society; and the society’s customers were scattered
throughout practically all the suburbs—one here and
another three streets further on. Successful trading
under those circumstances was just about impos-
sible.
The co.’s liabilities are heavy: Debentures,
£11,894 ; mortgage, £13,000; bank overdraft,
£4002; outstanding cheques, £7744 ; sundry credi-
tors, £1073; total, £37,713. There is, however,
£26,000 to come off this on account of the sale of
the Flinders-street property; how much is to go
back to debit on account of the new premises isn't
mentioned. At present various premises stand at
£45,574, while stock on hand is only £24,371.
Until the position is reversed, this co. is likely to
remain the shocking example among Australian co-
operative stores. The share canital now stands at
£ 52,823.

money to advantage. An amount equal to the whole

obviously, therefore, much depends on how that stock
is valued. A large part of it is also liable to con-

been written off property. One cannot tell how
big they are; but the next small table may throw
some light into that dark place. The figures show

(2) paid for all new plant and other purchases; and
(3) put by £145,750. As for the dividend, it will
be noted that £120,000 of reserves have been trans-
ferred to capital during the past few years; so the
present 10 p.c. is only a little under 15 p.c. on the
actually-paid capital ( £280,000). It wasn’t always
like that, though. Formed in 1881. the co. had a
hard struggle for many years, and it wasn’t until it
had built up a fine bunkering trade that there was
any glitter on the results. Even a 6 p.c. div. didn’t
arrive till the middle ’9o’s. Nowadavs the business
i-s very steady, with a slight tendency upwards. This
shows the output:—
1904 .. 532,228 tons. 1900 .. 560,809 tons.
1905 .. 1910 .. 616,531 „
1906 .. 570,000 „ 1911 (9mos.) 470,750 ~
1907 .. 610,750 ~ 1912 .. 621,322 „
1908 .. 613,218 „
A few years ago it was calculated that the coal
reserves would last about 40 years—27 years on
from now. A sinking fund was established to wipe
out the capital cost of the undertaking within that
period. With its own intertest-earnings that fund
now amounts to £51,282. Since the date of that
original estimate, large discoveries of mineral have
been made, and the life of the property has been
extended, provided no catastrophe happens. Never-
theless the original basis of the sinking fund has
been adhered to by a management whose long-
headedness strikes this paper most favorably. There
isn’t indeed another Australasian coal-mining con-
cern which seems to so thoroughly realise that its
principal asset is wasting all the time and must
presently disappear altogether.

A select Melbourne crowd has made a lot of money
out of wrecks during the last few years, and this
hasn’t been the least profitable of them. After the
Freehold Assets Realisation Co. had sent its divers
down and explored the ruins, the management re-
ported that there certainly wouldn’t be anything
for the shareholders in the old “bank,” while, as for
the depositors, they would be lucky if they got
much more than 6s. Bd. in the £. The old business
was accordingly wound up and this new co. was
started. Shareholders were regarded as dead ; credi-
tors got nominally 7s. 7s. in the £—3s. in shares
and 4s. in 4 p.c. debentures, and 7d. was passed on
as a nest-egg in the new co.’s reserve fund. That
was in 19C7. The proceeds of a few extra-good
harvests were just then beginning to pile up; the
States’ borrowing boom was starting; and between
these two things, with a little help from others,
values began to kick up their heels again. This
co., being in the liquidation business, naturally
grabbed a buyer when it found him ; and the grab
has been pretty steady, though not violent. When
sales have been completed, the surplus over the
written-down value has been reckoned as profit;
while expected profit on sales made on terms has been
passed to a contingency fund, which is now £19,673
in credit. This latter item isn’t included with the
reserves in the table. Of the past year’s profit,
£4262 (less some expenses probably) has come
from sales. As the co. can’t go on selling the same
property, it is obvious that, unless it gets new
business, the profits must shrink presently. Recog-
nising this, and finding that the business of buying
wrecks is much to its liking, the Freehold Assets
Co. lately bought 140,500 out of a total of 145,700
shares in the Land Mortgage Bank of Victoria —a con-
cern which struck the same storm and found the
same rock as the Freehold Investment and Banking
Co. The effect of this deal is to put up the asset
“Shares in other cos. at cost” from £15.851, as at
December, 1911, to £102,686. as at the end of
1912. The purchase has, however, been easily
financed. Liabilities have moved up only from
£74,364 to £98,985; the balance of the purchase
money has come out of liquid assets and from reali-
sations. Of the liabilities, £70.949 is on account
of the debentures issued when the co. was formed.
Twelve months ago there was 31s. per 20s. share
visible for shareholders, assuming that the proper-
ties in hand bring only their book-value; and,_ as
remarked before, properties so far have been bring-
ing a good deal more than that. But the Land Mort-
gage deal completely alters the look of things. The
new asset represents almost one-half of the total
assets, and there is no data yet to show how it is

Reserves transferred to capital, £12,500 .. 4,976
Dec., 1912.. 3348 7£p.c.= 2335 1013 5,989
Of the co.’s reserves as at June, 1912, £13,716 con-
sisted of share premiums. The extremely doubtful
course has now been pursued of transferring £12,500
of this fund to capital, and the still more doubtful
course has been followed of transferring the balance
(£1216) to Dividend Reserve. Presumably this
latter reserve is a fund for the equalisation of divi-
dends, so we may presently have the spectacle of a
reputedly respectable co. paying a dividend out of
premium capital. Market-riggers could play a nice
game this way. Suppose a co. in which they were
interested wanted more capital. With tongue in
cheek they could boost things by issuing shares to
themselves at, say, 30s. apiece, that being 2s. or 3s.
above market value ; then presently they could further
boost things by declaring an utterly fictitious divi-
dend to absorb the premium they had previously
collected from themselves. The law may allow this
sort of business; but even if the law acquiesces, a
Stock Exchange with a proper regard for the invest-
ing public would jump hard on a co. which plays
any tricks with premium capital. Apart from this,
the accounts tell little of any value. Profit for the
half-year is alleged to be £3348, but how much or
how little has been written off against depreciation
there is no way of finding out. It is a matter of
trusting the management—the management which
transfers premium capital to a dividend reserve. The
capital stands at £62,258; and liabilities total
£14,093. On the other side the principal items
are —skip properties, £45,776; freeholds, wharves,
etc., £32,619; Pearl Bav estate (less amount
received from purchaser), £3177. The co. is gradu-
ally getting rid of the Harbor foreshore properties
into which it plunged some time ago, before it
found out that there wasn’t as much in the picnic-
ground business as it thought; and the proceeds are
going into new ferries, presumably to replace the
venerable arks with which the co. has been carrying
on its rather precarious business along the upper and
mostly tram-served reaches of the Harbor.

Sales have moved up a trifie during the year, but
costs have moved up faster, so after paying the 10
p.c. div. there is only a miserable little £2O avail-
able for reserves. Worse still, there is no hint that
anything whatever has been written off on account
of wear and tear. Of the reserves the bulk consists
of a depreciation fund, to which £5OO is now trans-
ferred; and if £5OO is a fair thing to charge for the
twelve-months’ depreciation, then the 10 p.c. div.
wasn’t anything like earned. The time has come
when the directors should seriously consider whether
they are not fooling themselves and a lot of other
people.

“Gargoyle” : The more I see of company
directors the less I think they are necessary. Par-
ticularly superfluous is the director of the little
mining co. and his brother of the bank or life assur-
ance office. When four or five of the little ones
bustle into the fortnightly meeting of a little gold
mining co., which survives on threepenny monthly
calls, they usually find the business on the agenda
paper cut and dried lor them to adopt, and all the
cheques neatly filled up for the two best writers to
sign. Sometimes there is no agenda paper; always
there is a cheque for directors’ fees. The legal
manager makes sure of that cheque—and of his
own. Often there are minutes to hear read and to
confirm. Just as frequently there are no minutes of
previous meetings. One director, usually the chair-
man, does what real work there is to do after the
mine manager and the legal manager have ordered
the goods and engaged the miners. There is no
question of policy for the other directors to he!])
decide; they are mere surplusage, never ornamental
and rarely useful. In fact, most of these extra
directors know nothing of mining, and only about
2 p.c. of them have ever been down a mine. The
other 98 p.c. are afraid to venture in the cage. The
case against the director who is not wanted is as
strong in the instance of a bank or insurance co.
The bank director turns up on Wednesdays for one
hour to hear the general manager read the con-
fidential statement as to the amount of cash on hand,
and the quantity of bills discounted or overdrafts
granted by himself and the country managers; but
the Board rarely sees either the bills-discounted lists
or the overdraft lists. Everything is done by the per-
manent officials, and the only time a director does
any active work is when he calls to ask general
manager to look kindly on his friend Billkin’s appli-
cation for a loan. To the bank directors who thrust
advances on unwilling managers during the Mel-
bourne land boom, was nearly entirely due the
resultant smash. If the chief officers had been left
alone, the Scotch deposit money would not have
been thrown to three or four groups of allied land
speculators. And with stronger reason is the director
of a mutual life assurance society a useless ap-
pendage. He does not introduce business; he can-
not investigate loans or mortgages; he does not
seek to shape a policy he would spoil if he did; and
he, too, is a mere decoration to a newspaper adver-
tisement. When a director of this class of co. in-
terferes in its administration it is usually to get
an appointment for a relative or do a job for a
friend. In the United States and in Germany the
director, as we know him, is unknown. In Aus-
tralia he is a valueless excrescence, and should be
scraped off.
“The best possible” scheme of reconstruc-
tion put forward by the receiver of the Common-
wealth Oil Corporation makes cold reading. He
proposed to deal with things this way:—
(1) Issue £350,000 of 6 p.c. prior lien deben-
tures, giving £175,000 in 5 p.c. shares as a bonus
to subscribers.
(2) To induce the holders of the existing
£150,000 of 5/ p.c. first mortgage debentures to
agree, offer them 6 p.c. and pay their arrears of
interest in cash.
(3) Exchange the existing £400,000 second de-
bentures for £240,000 debentures (not secured) ;
interest 6 p.c. Interest arrears on the old deben-
tures not to be paid.
(4) Sundry creditors for £lOO,OOO to get £50,000
in unsecured 6 p.c. debentures.
(5) Shareholders (£725,007) to get £175,000
ordinary shares.
r l his means that the old shareholders would lose
£550,000 and the old debenture-holders and credi-
tors £230,000, plus arrears of interest. The new
capital paid up would be £350,000, out of which
interest arrears would be taken. The scheme, ac-
cording to latest advices, had little hope of going
through; and it would probably be ineffective if it
did go through. The wasted capital proposed to be
written off was quite inadequate, and the money
proposed to be put up was inadequate, too.

The Queen Bee (N.S.W.) many months
ago was spreading her wings and generally getting
busy. The weather was propitious, and the unusu-
ally knowing ones predicted that a flight was about
to be made. That was at the beginning of the
copper boom. But somehow the ascent never took
place, and now there has been a nasty drop instead,
on account of the warden’s refusal to grant a six-
months’ suspension of labor conditions. The next
move belongs to the co. Mismanagement is what’s
the matter with the Bee.

Bodangora (N.S.W.), after putting up
a lengthy struggle on its own account, is to be
turned over to the tender mercies of tributors,
whose job it will be to gouge out the ounce stone
said to have been developed. If the report as to the
existence of the stuff be true, it doesn’t look as if
the mine is altogether to blame, even though its very
flat dip does make mining expensive. The mine is
only a few miles from the railway at Wellington and
is well situated in many respects. Gold has been
proved over a wonderful length, and there seems to
be plenty about. The co. retains the right to the
tailings. Next door, or on the property itself, there
is a cyanide plant putting through accumulated
tailings—apparently just for the fun of the thing,
as there are no visible signs of any profit.

Pulganbar, the alleged mercury (with a
dash of copper) show outside Grafton (N.S.W.), is
once again heard from; but this time it is in a
comparatively chastened mood. During the interval
of silence the oil engine (the chief asset brought
into the amalgamation by the old co.) was replaced
by a steam engine, and a new pump was erected,
having six times the capacity of the old one. The
mercury furnace j,s reported to have given a highly
satisfactory test, the recovery being perfect. What
there will be to perfectly recover in the future is
the interesting question. Meanwhile the plant is
billed to start at once.

Chairman A. Bowler had the sense to put
the acid on the man who got up and talked hifalutin
at the recent meeting of the Australian Diamond
Mines. Bowler has the cold-blood microbe in his
veins, and so is content to merely repeat that the
pipes on the co.’s lease at Delegate (N.S.W.) resemble
the Kimberlite matrix in S’African mines. Yet, as
Bowler truthfully says about the myriads of garnets
found, that “means nothing” so far. The little
white octagon has to be got before a tiara can
adorn the brow of the Australian Diamond Mines or
a motor be added to the directors’ backyard.

When Hawkins Hill (N.S.W.) fails to
come forward with news about the discovery of a
virgin reef, it may be taken that it is in a bad
way. That, however, is not yet, as the latest to
hand relates to a new untried reef found on the
surface near the Exhibition shaft. Coarse gold, “in
specks weighing pennyweights,” is reported, with
prospects up to lOoz. per ton. Samples are hurrying
citywards. But the trouble is never with the sam-
ples. It is always with the reefs that the samples
come from.
Prom Vic. mining engineer W. A. Rain:
The reference to the Murray-Rain crowd in connec-
tion with the Ajax Central (B. 27/3/T3) is mis-
leading. I am not a director of the Ajax Central,
and have nothing whatever to do with its control,
either directly or indirectly. As regards the sugges-
tion that I am inclined to withhold information in
regard to the extent and value of a mine’s ore re-
serves, let me say that I know of no Victorian mine
which declares the tonnage and value of its ore
reserves, and it seems to me unfair to single me out
for not being the one exception to this order (?) of
things. It is also unfair to mention specifically any
one Victorian mine, and condemn its Board for not
doing what no other mine in the State is doing.
The question of declaring the tonnage and value of
the ore reserves of Victorian mines is one either for
the suffering shareholders of any individual mine, or,
taking the mines in toto, a matter for Government
intervention. Many men, inexperienced in mine
sampling, but experienced in the management and
control of Victorian mines, have expressed to me
their opinion that it is not possible to estimate the
value of a Victorian mine by sampling. I consider
this opinion erroneous, but I wish here to emphasise
the importance of the personal equation. In other
words, the right man must supervise the work and
make the estimate, and grave differences of opinion
are likely to arise as to who is the right man. I
believe, however, that no proper idea of the value of
any mine, more especially of a small mine, can be
conveyed by a cold statement in figures of estimated
tonnage and average value. In every case the state-
ment requires to be amplified more or less by de-
scriptive writing, which will necessarily be colored
by the engineer’s views regarding future develop-
ment —not forgetting that the real development of a
mine is done in its stones, the drives, crosscuts, rises
and winzes being simply “highly suggestive.”

A legend has run for years that a deep
lead exists in the Ovens Valley (Vie.) below where
the dredgers are turning the surface into a gravel
mound. A lively little Welshman has been check-
ing data, and there would be as much talk over his
boring as over ■some of the best work in the Cathcart
Central, if people had the time to listen. Anyway,
a paddock of 3000 acres is roped in, and 1000 acres
are to go in a float for 15,000 paid-ups and £lOOO
cash in a co. of 60,000 shares. The private work
done by the syndicate is said to exactly bear out the
results of the old State bores, and gold has been
actually found. This is more satisfying than the
deduction that, because gold was got in the adjoin-
ing hills, it must be found in the deep lead. With-
out damping the syndicate’s spirits, the old advice
has to be repeated—bore the lead well before starting
the mine. Then, if the bores are good enough, don’t
skimp the sinking, for no one knows what drainage
from the mountains goes underground in the Ovens
Valley system. Also, don’t dream that a call or two
will put the claim on gold. At Creswick the average
outlay was about £lOO,OOO per shaft. At other
leads of any size the outgo was £30,000 upwards;
and there is no evidence that the cost will be less in
the Ovens Valley.

Ivanhoe (W.A.) has at last confessed that
it can’t maintain present profits any longer. This
time the monthly surplus is to be reduced to
,£14,000, and the drop will take effect at once. The
general manager’s latest estimate of ore in sight is
1,080,850 tons of a gross value of £2,196,897,
while that of the consulting engineers (8., M. and
Co.) is 1,089,595 tons containing £2,201,890.
Allowing 30s. per ton to cover all exes, and loss in
residues, these figures give a profit of 575. 6d. and
565. 9d. per share respectively.
Associated Northern (W.A.) is shoving
down its shaft at Ora Banda as quickly as possible,
and hopes to open out at No. 5 level in a month or
so. It will, however, take two or three months
longer to reach the point where the rich shoot is
expected to be cut. Meantime, the market has
added to the value of the stock a good deal more
than the new property warrants.
* * * *
An official circular announces that the
Great Boulder directors have surrendered the option
on the Great Victoria, development work there
having given disappointing results. It is added,
however, that the Board has “other important busi-
ness in hand of very considerable promise.” Some
admirers of the show reckon that Great Victoria
was turned down without a fair trial. But this
is certain: as the shafts and winzes were sunk ore
values dropped, and to have acquired the property
in the face of this would have earned for the man-
agement a shower of bricks.
Victorian alluvial expert Briant has been
engaged by Dr. Laver and others to report on the
leads at Kanowna. Hamilton, of the Great Boulder,
and Yeo, who works in with Lionel Robinson and
party, have also decided to import another Vic-
torian to prospect the same locality on their behalf.
There are tons and tons of gold still in the ground
at Kanowna, but the problem of profitably extract-
ing it isn’t easy to solve.
Another change of management is pend-
ing at the Gwalia (W.A.). Some months ago_ tne
then superintendent, Jack McDermott, had a differ-
ence with the general bosses (8., M. and Co.), and
resigned. A. Wauchope was brought down from
Yuanmi to do things that it was thought McDermott
couldn’t do, and after a short innings he has re-
tired. Several queer things have taken place on
this mine during the past 12 months, and an in-
vestigation into some of them wouldn’t do any
harm. # *
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) is reported
to be looking “very healthy” in the upper levels,
but in the lower levels it still appears to be off-
color. An average grade of about 6dwt. is being
milled, and with a bit of luck the management
hopes to maintain this for some time to come.
* * * *
Corinthian North, near Bullfinch (W.A.),
has its plant nearly ready, and expects to start
crushing this month. The ore to be treated is
estimated at 30s. per ton, and as working expendi-
ture should not average more than 12s. per ton, a
monthly surplus of £2OOO on 2500 tons crushed is
anticipated. * As the co. wanted nearly all the
money it could lay its hand on for plant and equip-
ment, very little development has been done during
the past six months; but directly revenue is derived
from ore treatment this matter will receive atten-
tion. It is proposed to deepen the shaft in order to
obtain sufficient water for milling purposes. For
the present, the mine will be worked mostly on the
open-cut system.
* * * *
8., M. and Co. have thrown up their
option on Perkins’s lease at Gwalia (W.A.). A few
hundred feet of development was done on the shoot
above water-level, but nothing to warrant a deal
was met with. Locally the show is believed to have
the continuation of the Sons of Gwalia lode. Pos-
sibly it has; but as far as 8., M. and Co. could see,
the gold isn’t there.
When last heard of, Boulder No. 1
(W.A.) had some tributors breaking ore in various
parts of its Kalgoorlie property, and dust-storms
were interfering with its slime-treatment works at
Lennonville. Nothing short of a miracle will put
the co. on its feet again.

Queensland mines last year produced
£4 175,355, of which copper gave £1,698,280 and
gold £1,477,979. Mount Morgan, easily the biggest
mine in the State, gave nearly equal values of the
red and yellow metals —copper, £641,887; gold,
£583 682. At Cloncurry copper preponderates—
£76l,7ss out of the total of £842,267 from all
sources. On that field Mount Elliott led; its
54,631 tons returned £540,266. The gold output
of ’the State shows a decreasing yield, and the slump
would have been much worse but for the metallur-
gical works, which got great help from the boom in
industrial metals. Of quartz mines, the Scottish
Gvmpie was the most consistent; it produced
86,700 tons averaging s.7dwts., and paid £16,500
in dividends. _
Said that Lionel Robinson, Clark and Co.,
are nibbling at the 300,000 Mount Morgan shares m
the late Walter Russell Hall’s estate. The price
mentioned is 60s. If the big deal is concluded, the
shares will go to London, where the firm will see
to some preliminary booming. This, more than any
changes at the mine, has been responsible for the
recent firming of the stock in the market.
* * *
A start has been made with the Chillagoe
Co.’s railway to the Mulligan coalfield. Prospectors
will doubtless be attracted in that direction for the
country adjacent is highly mineralised. Chillagoe s
most important mine, the Einasleigh, is looking up a
bit. The new lode struck in deepening the main
shaft is low-grade silicious ore, but is a big, solid-
looking body which may give better assays in other
parts. . , *
The Marble Island Iron and Limestone Co.
(0 ) registered in 1904, has had a merry life. It
started with 200 £lO shares. For the four years
1907-1910 it paid divs. of £43 per share, thanks to
flux purchases bv Mt. Morgan and Great Fitzroy.
last *vear the directors were negotiating for the
sale of ore for three years, which sale would have
paid another £35 per share, but at the last moment
business fell through. Things, therefore, are dull
now and the directors are thinking of selling the
whole outfit at anything over £5O per share Some
shareholders, however, want to hang on, and there
are threats of Law in consequence.
Thus a Melbourne Ahgus financial cable:
“Mount Elliotts, 106/3—loB/9. The sales of Mount
Elliott are due to a French pool being in difficul-
ties.” Any excuse is good enough; seemingly, the
shutting down of the mine has nothing to do with
the slump. Facts are, this stock was puffed to a
ridiculous figure, and Alphonse was landed with most
of the shares at the top of the market. The alleged
creep in Mount Elliott itself may be taken with some
salt. The real trouble is the short supply of ore
of the old high grade. Certainly, there was a
fire in the Hampden Consols —a very opportune fire.
How much timber was there in the Consols, any-
way?

Transvaal’s gold output for January was
789,398 fine oz. This is another record, being
97280 z. better than the previous best (May, 1912).
A return of 1,000,0000 z. a month is, according to
some optimists, likely to be recorded before long.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, April 7, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
On Saturday afternoon the Rose Bay goff
house was full of the scent of orris root and
hot scones. Four hundred or so of our most
Expensive Persons jerked their tightly-
swathed limbs out of cars, cabs and three-
penny trams, and ambled up the flower-
edged strip of asphalt to the eternal tea-
tables. The German Consul’s lady gave one
large Pekoe party, and Point Piper rallied
round another dame who consistently feeds
the hollow interiors of innumerable acquaint-
ances on the fatted cream puff.
Mr. Ted Simpson, captain of the Golf
Club, showed Governor Strickland and his
blue-eyed daughter the sights, and tennis
raged furiously on the lower lawms where
Mrs. Ted Antill and C. F. Stowe won a
mighty tourney (mixed doubles) and van-
quished Mr. and Mrs. Hooper in the finals.
The opening day brought all the best golfers
from their summer hiding places. Dr. and
Mrs. Kelty topped the score in mixed four-
somes. The Hugh Macneils were lower down
in the count, Miss Williamson and J. P.
Doyle hurrying along ahead. The Rose Bay
caddie resumed his grasshopper flight in
search of lost balls, and the deluge oblig-
ingly postponed its arrival till Saturday
night.
The Prince Alfred Hospital, a vast net-
work of wards, will hold its annual meeting
on April 14. Governor Strickland takes the
chair, and will divide his attention between
the balance sheet, and the nurses who flutter
to the front to get their priceless rewards
of merit. No priceless reward is worth less
than 2d.
The legal ladies of the High Court big-
wigs haven’t hitherto been remarkable for
anything but Stodge of the purely suburban
type, and a jealous clutch at their own un-
important Importance. Now a picturesque
personality, the brand new Justice Rich’s
handsome wife, will toss her plumes amongst
the dull dames of horsehair circles. Mrs.
Rich used to be a Miss Bowker. She is a
daughter of the late medico of that name,
and won the breathless admiration of ad-
miring friends by the capable manner in
which she mothered, as a slip of a girl, a
generous helping of brothers and sisters.
Without an ounce of folly or incapacity in
her mental make-up, the level-headed Mrs.
Rich is a charming addition to the veteran
fleet of legal lady cruisers in these parts.
Ex-Bush Brother Feetham, the long, lean
bishop-elect of North Queensland, was fare-
welled in Dubbo wflth an address and a
cheque. As Parson Feetham is going to
take on a pretty tough billet, with the dis-
tinction of being about the worst paid bishop
in the Anglican fold, he’ll find the cheque
very handy. The address might make an
emergency meal for his nag in time of
drought. When a North Queensland cleric
pays for his own oats, there’s supposed to be
mighty little left over for the necessary gee-
gee.
That cherubic young parson, Saumarez
Smith, and his wife are leaving for Eng-
land in the immediate future. The Saum-
marez Smiths didn’t make any great blaze
on these shores. The late Archbishop of
Sydney was a man of peace, with a generous
waist-line, and no hankering to split skulls
re the Boyne River accident of long, long
ago. But the “Bob” Smith cab fare epi-
sode stuck to him like wax, though his ex-
planation had a grain of truth in it. Only
a woman with an iron iaw would ever dare
to give cabby his legal fare. His late Legs
of Sydney argued that in handing out the
exact fare (one shilling), he was fighting for
a principle. But the weak-kneed will always
over-pay, and the mean will invariably give
less than the just fare, if they can, so the
principle wasn t worth the “Bob” nickname.
Suffragette Mrs. Pankhurst, who has just
been served with a sentence of three years’
plain, cold English gaol for being an uncom-
mon nuisance, has babbled politics all her
life. Her father was a red-hot Radical, so,
naturally, when she was sent to Paris to
school, she chummed up with Rochefort’s
daughter, and after that she was no end of
a red Republican. When she- married it
was to another political—a mild, scholarly
“an who was a leading member of .T. S
Mill s Women’s Suffrage Society. Pa Pank-
hurst had one victory; he drafted the
Married Women's Property Bill, which be-
came law. I hen he died, and the widow
had to battle for her own crust —which she
did for some years as registrar of births and
deaths in Manchester or thereabouts.

the awe-inspiring name
of Mrs Ruffey Hill has come from Westralia
to shake up the morals of this port in the
matter of the alleged V bite Slave Traffic,
which is a vague substance and not to be
found in the directory. Mrs. Mayoress Cocks
held the fort in the Y.M.C.A. lecture hall
the other afternoon, while the meeting thrilled
with the Ruffey Hill oratory.
Frank Thompson, a fine young Cornstalk,
much admired by the girls hereabouts, is off
to Europe for six months. He’s something
in the Lands Office by way of earning a
crust, and spends most of his Sundays as a
church organist, instead of cracking oysters
up the dizzy reaches of Middle Harl^r.
The Walter Blundells are over from Well-
ington (M.L.) for a few weeks. He follows
the pleasing occupation of owning, or part-
owning, that snug property, the Evening
Post. It thunders forewords of political
omen once a day in the Windy City, and
Editor Lukin turns the handle of the
thunder.
A week or two ago, the far-off M.L. town
of Invercargill landed an Austrian woman
journalist. She was promptly interviewed.
Alice Schalek gives the impression of being
a happy little Bohemian knocking about in
odd ends of the earth on behalf of a Vien-
nese paper—a billet every pen-driver with
the wander-thirst in her veins yearns for,
though it wears out boots and takes your
front hair out of curl. The scribbler un-
folded about a column of matter re
the Austria-Bulgarian-Servian triangular
tangle. Servia, it appears, has only one
market for pigs—Austria. But the haughty
Austrian won’t look at Servian hog, hence
the pursuit of a new market in Adrianople.
The latter town, however, is rather over-
crowded with ruins just now to be much
good to pig of any nationality. The Austrian
lady left Invercargill for a scamper through
the top half of the Dominion. Later, she
skims this continent in search of copy. In-
vercargill must sue her for damages, if she
forgets to mention that it grows the most
southern lamp-post in the world. Of course
it doesn’t, but it likes to think that it does.
Saturday was private view day at the
Royal Art Society’s .room. The atmosphere
of Rip Van Winkle fell heavily on two view-
ers who slumbered on the long settee that
faced the oil section. No surging throng
shook their sub-conscience lethargy. They
turned heavily in their sleep as the cat-like
tread of the occasional critic or patron fled
past the worst offences on the opposite wall.
The throng that might have attended the art
show, but didn’t, was mostly at Randwick, or
on the Rose Bay golf links. In the Chamber
of Sleep one ecstatic snore woke the startled
echoes, and the startled echoes snored back.
Alfred Coffey values an effort in oils caUed
“White Satin” at 25 of the obsolete coins
called guineas, which means £25 and 25
twentieths of a pound. There are no guineas
in circulation now, but some people will talk
in the dead coin. You really might as well
price your picture in talents, or shekels, or
rose nobles, or fix the value at 10 lakhs of
rupees and one anna and a few piastres and
a franc and a boliviano. The guinea vaguely
recalls the story of the hen and a half that
laid an egg and a half in a day and a half,
about which time the clock stopped so that
no one knew how many minutes and a half
it was after half-past something.
To return to the 25-guinea pic-
ture, the lady ’inside this frock must
have been rushed at a bargain sale
if she gave more than 4M. a yard for
the material, which looks like glazed calico
—the really cheap brand you give the prim-
eval savage for a cocoanut isle, if you get
ahead of the local missionary in the deal.
The “White Satin” lady wears a bleak air
of stony disappointment, so I suppose she
hates her shroud as cordially as does the
spectator. Mabel Barling still stalks hun-
gry looking lions, and sketches them on fast
days for her Zoo collection.
Mosman ought to turn out to its
last man and its final dog to see
what it looks like in a water carnival.
The artist’s name is Beer. Arthur J. W.
Burgess is a delightful person who casts a
glamor over the grey hulks of modern
cruisers. His wonder-patch of Reckitt’s blue
water flecked with foam, “Pacific Shores,” is
the illustration every Louis Becke story is
waiting for. You can almost see the brown
siren behind the slender poles of the palm-
trees, putting the last touch to her toilet of
hibiscus flowers (one behind each ear). Bur-
gess forgot to put her in the background, but
you know the minx is there just the same.
Women artists are few in the water-color
section at the R.A.S. show, but Bernie Pring
shows them the way in soft shades of peri-
winkle blue labelled “Mount Dundas”
(Tassy’s Isle).
A few weeks ago the Bondi Surf Club
selected two teams to compete for the Roth
Challenge Shield. The chosen only amounted
to about eight or so out of the 80 or more
members of the club which wrestles with
the business end of a breaker, and is poured
off the top of a big wave like something
of no importance out of a dish. So a
huge and healthy Bondi surfer named
Ormsby, who also belongs to the club of life-
savers, conspired with other mermen tocom-
bete rr / or / .rt le shield- They were dubbed the
U.I.T. (Unofficial Inefficient Team). But
when the day of reckoning came with the
serried hosts of fish-men, the U.I.T. snatched
the trophy from all-comers. The shield,
however, mysteriously vanished for a day or
two, pending an academic debate as to
whether the U.1.T., being chosen only of
itself, could officially win anything. A
crowded meeting, after a debate that would
paralyse the best efforts of a fully-fledged
politician in the act of raising his own
salary, decided by a majority of one, that it
would take the U.I.T. back to the official
cave. So all aspersions are withdrawn, and
the marine Potts now associates with the
sea Slurk on terms of amity. If the amity
isn’t quite real, it is at least a fair imita-
tion.
Zanelli, who came here with the “Butter-
fly” opera co. as a mild young baritone, has
developed a fine dramatic tenor. Some day
he may uplift it in a thanksgiving song to
the Australian climate, when he handles big
fees in opera or marries an heiress. (N.B. —•
Any good-looking tenor with an ounce of
pluck can carry off a moneyed maiden if he
wears the right clothes and has large melan-
choly eyes.) Zanelli’s farewell concert was
a tumult of enthusiasm. He goes first to
place the tenor he found in Sydney under
the noted Perilli in Naples. Later, he will
warble operatic rbles under Jean de Reszke
in Paris. Jean used to be a baritone him-
self before he climbed into a tenor, by the
way. To quote the singer’s own words:
“My father sent for me to return and finish
my studies on the Continent. I remained
in Sydney with a purpose. Soon after com-
ing to Australia I noticed that my voice was
changed. It is the climate —I am sure of it.
So now I have the stuff —the tenor voice—
I go to place it under Perilli.” Just here
the office cynic inquires whether Zanelli
phre can bribe the Australian tenor voice
not to turn into a Neapolitan bass or a
French baritone or a German sausage.
The friends of musician Hellemann, who’s
going to wave his baton over the Welling-
ton (M.L.) choral society, are gathering
themselves together in one place as this
meets your eye. A purse of sovereigns will
be forced into the Hellemann tail-pocket as
a token of farewell. The whole reason of
the tail-pocket is that when you wear it
your friends can crawl up behind you like
pale backbiters in the night, and shove
money upon you unbeknownst. Then,
as soon as they are gone, you take it out
and shove it into your front pocket lest the
Artful Dodger should get at it.
The Sydney Phil, had the luck to capture
Mary Conly for two festival concerts, the
rather dull “Elijah” and the gorgeous “Cre-
ation.” Hadyn’s poetic dream of the begin-
ning of things is an improvement on facts.
The first man was a savage who probably
argued with a club and knocked his lady on
the head if the fig soup wasn’t up to the
mark. In oratorio, Adam addresses Eve in
the language of a vegetarian Chesterfield,
“Graceful consort, by thy side, softly fly the
golden hours.”
The Town Hall was packed with con-
firmed Conlyites for the “Creation.” Mary’s
beautiful voice is evidently as carefully shep-
herded by the owner as is the Melba' organ
by the only Nellie. The Conly soprano
keeps the bird-like purity of a youthful
warble. Allied to brilliant technique, it
soared high and sweet above the growls of
the ’cellos or the combined voices of the huge
Phil, chorus. “On mighty pens” and “With
verdure clad” were vocal triumphs with
which large selections of flappers from local
schools slaked their musical thirst. Regi-
nald Gooud, the hundred-fathoms-deep or sea-
bottom basso of the oratorio, curled his mas-
sive voice round “furious storms’ tempestu-
ous rage,” and descended to lower G or
thereabouts to earmark the birth of the first
worm. It was the most bottomless worm
on record. Even the deepest and most un-
profitable mine at Bendigo doesn’t compare
with it. Tenor Higginbotham, beautiful to
behold in immaculate and priceless swallow-
tails, was the mild Uriel of the solo cast.
Artist Frances Hodgkins, whose head-
quarters are in Paris, will give a one-woman
show here within the coming week. On
April 15 the public will be welcomed in a
select corner of Anthony Hordern’s art show
rooms to view the Hodgkins water-colors.
The Maorilander, who left her native geysers
for Europe about 10 years ag- was the' first
and only petticoat ever elected as teacher of
water-colors in the classic Academy Colla-
rossi, in Paris. Later, she set up a small
academy of her own in the city of boule-
vards. Miss Hodgkins gets steep prices for
her work. She returns to her French pupils
at the beginning of the Paris winter term,
which is October. At present she is linger-
ing picturesquely with her cousin. Mrs
George Rich (the lady whose husband has
hed the High Court wig fitted to
his judicial cranium), at Darling Point.
A slim youth, who started from his native
Hawera (M.L.) for London as a veteran of
Lf or Id summers, blew into this port from
the Dominion last week. His name is Hut-
chins, and his business is music. Pader-
ewski, who heard the infant prodigy six
years or so ago, advised that he should be
packed up and sent to the Royal Academy
forthwith. This was done, and the Hawera
boy pianist waded through a stiff course of
exams., emerging from the ruck as a sub-
professor before he put an edge on his first
razor. Hutchins, who has attained the lofty
eminence of —1 years, has been giving re-
cit<ils in Maoriland. After a lnnir \r* 1

Alice May Codogan, who is A T C L Vn “ 1
nothing of L.R.A.M., is rolling „ p h er five
years’ references from the I ien n ave

ment. After the boss school marm gets over

temsh ways the Welsh girl is all right when
the pmno lid is open. The famous Teich
muller, in Leipsic primed her with technique
for five years. Schreck, one of Germany’s
heavy-weight composers, filled up any snare
left over in Alice May’s smillperson
with composition, counterpoint and other
musical wonders and amazements. So the
Ipswich flapper ought to acquire better stvle
than is usually banged into the school man!
of a provincial town.
Madge Temple, the Tivoli goddess of
gowns, is a tall, handsome young woman
with a surprising soprano voice and 14 times
her fair and reasonable share of ostrich
feathers. Her tailor-built style reflects the
last gleam of fashion in perpendicular lines
of crystal buttons. She is an old friend of
Grace I'alotta, and has caught the Viennese
trick of putting a distracting touch of black
into some portion of her attire —half an inch
of black silk, or a thin strip of belting on a
rose coat, or a semblance of black velvet
under a white hat. The effect is It. But-
tons, I imagine, after a respectful interview
with a dozen or so Temple costumes, are
next to cut and color, the climax to a per-
fect outfit. The new, long, flat crystal but-
ton is like a slit almond made out of a slice
of decanter-stopper, colored with a flick of
absinthe.
The Madge Temple voice was trained by
Marie Duma (a Covent Garden authority)
for grand opera, but it descended to musical
comedy as a more auriferous profession. The
gold specks in opera are for the few. It is
odd to think of Ethel Irving in the trivial
jingle of comic opera, with Madge Temple
as her youthful understudy— yet that hap-
pened. But Ethel kept well, and didn’t give
her understudy a hope. The Voice was
afterwards raised in Stoll’s extracts of grand
opera at the Coliseum, and was commanded
to the _ presence of the Spanish King’s
mother-in-law, the Battenberg matron, who
is a very small royalty and the widow of a
royalty who was so small as to be almost
imperceptible. She paid the warbler in com-
pliments, while vaudeville pays in cash.
Hence, the Temple hats at the Tivoli. Yards
of ostrich tail trail round these temptations
(isn’t the Devil supposed to chuckle when
he sees a woman trying on a new hat?), for
which humble Eves sigh in vain.
Australia seems to be looking up as a
good address. Have you noticed that the
American Tittell-Brune is starred in the
Thames village as “the great Australian
actress”? /
The suffragette germ must have floated
round the King’s Ilall the other night, when
Prof. MacCallum addressed the Sydney Uni.
Women’s Union. A small, mild man, like
the literary MacCallum, seldom meets the
lady “objector” in her warpaint, since poli-
tics generally claim her undivided orations.
The burning subject of the next Senate elec-
tions, however, got the interjector and the
case for the prosecution into fighting line.
The little Prof, found his wind after being
asked whether he was present by his own
invitation, or something of the kind, and
threw a ton or two of hard mouth material
at the lady hecklers. Then he landed a
neat uppercut somewhere on the official per-
son of the Minister for Education. Figura-
tively, of course, for the Person wasn’t pre-
sent. The only information of any account
that the non-academic mind can drag out of
the recent uproar is the fact that the learned
Louisa Macdonald, M.A., is first favorite
in the female rush for a perch in the Senate.
This year the Royal Art Society proposes
to spread itself over an artists’ ball, which
is to be quite 200 degrees higher than all
previous efforts. The idea is a fancy hop.
illustrating the History of Australia from
the arrival of the first Spanish and Dutch
voyagers, up to 1860. Why 1860? The date
will prevent anyone appearing, either as the
Kelly Gang or as the bank smash of 1893.
Bushrangers and aboriginals will be wel-
comed. The. outlaw who designed the pre-
sent Australian stamp ought also to be im-
pounded. His costume should consist of a
few hundred Commonwealth stamps, in-
sufficiently gummed to his body. A general
rally of those interested will occur in the

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 7, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Alf. Vincent, The Bulletin’s esteemed
Melbourne artist, announced in a letter
dated April 4, that he was to be married on
April 5 to “the finest girl in the
world.” As a matter of fact, the
event really happened at St. James’s
Church on the date mentioned. Vin-
cent has hitherto been a chronic bachelor, but
he intimates that if he has fallen in love
later in life than some men, he has done it
badly in order to make up for lost time. The
lady is Miss Phyllis Potter, late of Sydney,
and everybody who knows her congratulates
Vincent. Also, everybody who knows Vincent
congratulates her, so things are about level.
The wedding presents included ten writs
for libel damages aggregating £50,000 —ten
writs at£sooo each. They were served by
ten of Vincent’s colleagues on The Bulle-
tin, including the general manager, the editor
and the associate editor. Each of them is
already married to the finest girl in the
world, and consequently the Melbourne ar-
tist’s statement is actionable. Eminent
counsel and other animals have been re-
tained. Meanwhile the financially ruined
pair are honeymooning at Healesville.
A 26-year-old woman of unremarkable
appearance led her fourth husband to a Mel-
bourne altar the other day. “Not No. 1, or
No. 2, or No. 3,” as the deluded valet used
to say in “Ma Mie Rosette,” “but, hang it!
No. 4.” The bride must have started her
matrimony at an early age. Pier first hus-
band lived four years after marriage. His
immediate successor lasted 15 months in holy
bonds, and the next one bade the world good-
night after nine months of wedded bliss.
That’s how the lady came to be marrying
her fourth in her 27th year. It sounds'like
a record—one of several Australia has put
up lately in the matter of marrying. Knibbs
told us the other day of a sprightly damsel
who had been divorced and remarried before
she was 18.
Lord Whitburgh, a burly but blas6-looking
young man in the late ’3o’s, was here for an
all too short stay. Our eligible girls had
heard that his peerage was a new “creation,”
and that his forbears were “colonial mer-
chants,” so, putting two and two together,
they reasoned that he was good enough,
matrimonially speaking. However, his get-
away was accomplished too decisively to
allow of any business being done. He plays
golf, and did a little in that line at the Mel-
bourne Club. A mother and sister are look-
ing after him.
Senators Tudor and Frazer laid them-
selves out to entertain F. M. B. Fisher,
Maoriland Minister for Marine and Customs,
who is here to have a look at the Dominion’s
new battleship. They invited a score of
people to meet him at lunch at the Oriental
Hotel. Mr. Fisher has brought along his
sister, Mrs. Mac Ewan. She graced the seat
of honor with big mustard-colored plumes
drooping over a particularly well-tailored
shoulder. Maorilander Manson and his lady
and Joshua of commerce were among the
guests.
Maud Washington Smith, a girl of high
social tonnage who divorced her medico hus-
band, Downey, some time ago, took unto
herself another spouse last week at
old St. James’s Church. The second experi-
ment is one Bryce, a big man with an English
engineering fame to match. Sister Mrs. Doc-
tor Downey (the two sisters Smith married
two brothers Downey, both doctors) shed the
light of her full approval on the wedding—a
smartly fixed-up affair, of which many of the
bride’s women-friends knew nothing until
after the event. She and hubby put up at
Menzies for a few days before leaving for
England. In that interval, she figured at the
Hug-Duckett wedding, and received heaps of
congratulations in a black velvet snood and a
marvellous cloak of pale pink chiffon velvet.
Edward Goll, Bohemian, who married the
young widow Julie O’Brien, has returned to
these parts because his wife is too good an
Australian to stay away. He comes covered
thick with London honors for his piano work,
and _is going to give Melbourne recitals on
April 26 and 28. Sister-in-law Mrs. Tom
Hogan, of Killegran, and all the other big
Society powers who dwell along the Balwyn
White Horse-road, are rousing Hawthorn
and Toorak to the call, and the Melbourne
Town Hall promises to be packed with the
Very Best chiffons.
Keith Maxwell, an eligible Sydney-sider,
has come and captured an English widow.
Mrs. Sayers. The lady had arranged to man-
age the Oriental Hotel, but after five weeks
she succumbed to matrimony, and departed
for Sydney with a grey chiffon bridal dress
and a pink feathered hat in her Saratoga.
Keith Maxwell has a station in Bananaland,
and is related to various well-known N. S.
Walers. A sister married the eldest son of
G. E. Pilcher, K.C. The new little bride is
plumping for Sydney as a dwelling place.
The better-half of the Thonemanns is lying
quietly in wait at a swagger suburban guest-
ery for her decree nisi, and intends to go
abrawd as soon as legal matters are arranged.
Mrs. Fred Thonemann, a daughter of James
Service, _is so rich that .she will be able to
indulge in extended wanderings.
Mrs. William 11. Higgins and her three
daughters left by the Osterley for Europe,
taking William H. along with them.
Col. Chauvel and his wife —a slim piece of
elegance from Bananaland—have taken a
residence in Toorak. They furnish the nur-
sery with a brace of small boys, beautiful
enough to win prizes at a baby show.
The officers of the battleship New Zealand
were billed for an afternoon tea-party at the
Oriental last week. Two hundred invitations
were out. Expectation cantered high. The
excitement in many a gentle female breast
was almost intolerable. And then, with a
sickening thud, comparable in its dreary
finality to the sound of a dead Chinaman
falling out of a third-floor window on to a
wet pavement, came the news that the fes-
tivity was off. The officers “regretted,” but
“they were coaling.” Fancy those divine
creatures shovelling coal!
Vida Goldstein and a number of other fair
self-advertisers are putting on a street scene
borrowed from poor old Suffragette-harassed
London. The performers stand in a rigid,
carefully-calculated pose, and hold out ban-
ners bearing the device “Votes for
Women.” Their elbows are primly tucked
in toward the waist-line, and a correctly-
gloved forefinger and thumb adhere genteelly
to the top of the placard. It is an attitude
that makes even a curvesome and right-hug-
able Suffragette look angular and forbidding.
The old Melbournians are giving a lawn
party at the Church of England Grammar
School on April 12. The delights that are to
be heaped on visitors are a sports pro-
gramme, tea and (hold tight) music in the
class-rooms.
The whole of the commissioned sea-lions
belonging to the battleships at present
making black smoke in our bay were asked
to dine with the vice-regal Denmans on
Friday night, and Lady Denman invited a
choice selection of girls from the Most Ex-
pensive circles to dance with them after
they had done feeding. About 40 cars, full
of fluffiness and impatience, arrived on the
scene too soon, and were kept in a queue in
the drive, severely cut off from the sacred
portico until the lengthy dinner terminated.
When the youthful Battenburg prince got
to the stage of dropping sugar in his black
coffee, somebody gave the signal and the
dead queue of motor wakened up. Men
chucked their cloaks through a sort
of mouse-hole in the outer hall, and
the women were herded in a narrow
cloak depository, lined with pigeon-holes
and garnished with one lonely and in-
adequate Venetian mirror. Even the solid
gold toilet fixings that backed it up, couldn’t
compensate for one mirror. Girls got out of
fur motor mufflings and stared with anxious
criticism at each other, for this was the sort
of hop that calls for every ounce of ammuni-
tion. Clothes simply shrieked in a deter-
mined effort after effect. One damsel hung
cerise over purple and another had petunia
panniers, like donkey’s packs, on either side
of a black and red brocade sheath. A fair
girl put on blue and white stripes as wide as
railway lines—broad gauge. A dear little
girl, just emerging from flapperdom, tilted
her nose in conscious superiority. She got
her original note by having all her pretty,
white, crisp tulle frills turned upside down
on the white sheath frock. She looked like
an adorable chicken very much ruffled. A
girl with maize-colored hair stood a flat pink
feather, quite a foot high, on top of her
head and drooped otherwise in flesh pink
fixings. The officers had something to rouse
their attention when these damsels came
through the swing doors, guarded by pink-
purple flunkeys. A vividly pretty young
matron had clothed herself in chiffon bro-
cade, the color of a tender young lemon,
while Mama appropriated the tint of the
ripe lemon for her magnificent gown. A
fine effect was achieved. A dame just
arrived from London and Paris might have
brought her dress from Timbuctoo. She
wore her feathers Red Indian fashion and
put her blazing diamond tiara on as a bul-
wark. A little new bride was demurely
subdued in black, and a tall member of a
wool family affected a purple cloak like a
Roman toga. Dress was all staccato or rag-
time, and the uniform of the officers com-
pleted the presto impassionata of the
theme. The ballroom. like many of
the dancers, was one half carpeted and one
half nude. The guests de luxe fed from gold
plate. Lady Denman, in black, had half a
sack of diamonds and pearls scattered over
her. She and her lord received the after-
dinner guests in the drawing-room, standing
with their backs against the fortress of the
bic. white marble fireplace, which usually
holds signed portraits of Royalty on its
chilly shelf.
Mayoress Hennessy gave a party to fare-
well three social Importants, who are going
abroad for a time. Ex-Mayoress Davey, one
of the departees, will plunge into London
Society under the wing of the local Lord
Mayor, who is a nephew of her husband, and
is enjoying a second term of office in the
Mansion House. She said her good-byes look-
ing buxom in black and white. Mrs. Moreil
was also farewelled, and so was Dame Gillotr.
wife °f the Sam who was first Gaud Mayor of
Melbourne. His predecessors didn’t have the
Gaud attachment. Mayoress Hennessy wore
a clingsome leaf-green garb. Mayor Hennes-
sey, the only man present, contrived to seem
quite cheerful under the circumstances. It is
the duty of Gaud Mayors to smile even at a
tea-party labelled “for women only.” The
heavy aldermanic air was absent from the
party. Mrs. Geoff. Syme added a frivolous
note to the dressing in a Frenchy pink frock
trimmed with ermine. Mrs. J. G. Barrett,
just back from London with her eye-doctor,
was a magnificence in old-gold silk. She
brought a daughter, who was nicely tucked
into a sealskin coat. Mrs. Godfrey spread
several yards of petunia silk with fur garnish-;
ings. Bands played cheerfully in the blue
rooms and the corridors, while the serious tea
business of the afternoon happened in the cosy
council room.
Sydney man Macintosh, who has come over
to manage the Oriental, has instituted a
Guest Night dinner that will make a world of
difference to hostesses worried by the Nary
Mary problem. While you dine a concert
proceeds in the Juliet balconies that jut out
over the turquoise winter-garden lounge. On
Friday night Arthur Andrews and Fred Col-
lier warbled sentimental ditties, and an
orchestra murmured classical scraps of comic
opera to the diners in the big oak hall, with
scarlet electrics to show up pretty frocks.
University Commencement on Saturday
was richly decorated by dons in gorgeous
robes and presided over by the Waxcellent
Chancellor in a flowing frock of honey-color
and black. Governor Fuller, an interested
spectator, was a mere cipher in the doings,
and sat in subdued civilian dress, at the right
hand of the enthroned Madden. Arts Prof.
Tucker, tall and correct, opened negotiations
with the Chancellor for the admittance of his
bunch of graduates, including sweet bachelor
girls to the number of 10. They swung their
rabbit-skin and colored hoods jauntily, and
favored the admiring eye of the Chancellor
with lovely blushes. Skeats, dark and debon-
air, squired the Science graduates. He wore
scarlet and the loveliest new-fashioned beef-
eater hat imaginable. There were girls after
Law and Medicine and Surgery and Teeth
and Music. Only the departments of the
Yets, and the Engineers escaped the feminine
invasion. Among the visitors on the plat-
form was horse-doctor Gilruth, Official Guard-
ian of Australia’s Front Door, looking like
a picture of Abraham Lincoln just after he
heard of Lee’s surrender.
The wives of the professors sat at the foot
of the platform, and Sassiety, in its prettiest
frock, yawned politely to the farthermost
limits of Wilson Hall. The admission of 132
new graduates might be inspiring from a
patriotic point of view, but the ceremony of
initiation becomes tedious. The solemn pro-
cession of the robed from the platform
savored of church on a Big day, and then
came a flurried break-up for tea. For this
last rite the building, which was once the
Museum, and after that was a music college,
and still later was transformed into an under-
grad.’s luncheon room, had been decorated
with the festive palm and laurel wreath. And
it calls for some extra-decoration, for some-
body has painted it in a crude color like
skinned rabbit. The wives of the professors
had charge of the tea-pots. Mrs. Peterson
was a dainty vision in lime color, Mrs. Allen
wore white, Mrs. Ewart came out into the
sunshine from a sick bed for an hour.
The Chancellor’s wife was gaily dressed
in pale blue, and Mrs. Professor Masson made
an energetic hostess in a soft black gown and
a charming manner.
Preparations for the winter balls are be-
ginning. _ The P’ran Mayoral hop—an
annual incident of importance—is billed to
happen on June 4. These coming events
cast terribly long shadows before, don’t
they?
Cards are out for a farewell mayoral spree
to three important dames —ex-Mayoress T.
J. Davey, ex-ex-Mayoress Gillott and Mrs.
S. J. Morell. The outburst will happen
early in the month.
The patient orchestra of the Theatre Royal
is boxed again in “Milestones,” and the
purring of the music comes from beneath
waterlilies and a green muslin pond. This
fashion of concealing the bald heads, pers-
piring faces and deplorable clothes of the
makers of music is growing. “Kismet” shut
them behind latticed screens in stage boxes,
and “The Blue Bird” buried them, like the
“Babes in the Wood,” under an avalanche of
leaves. Some of us wouldn’t complain if
they were buried beneath an avalanche of
blue-metal.
Two St. Kilda girls, Ruth and Evelyn
Sainton-Dolby (by the way, one of them has
just become Mrs. Somebody), who have
Voices and recurrent attacks of stageitis, are
feeling that “Milestones” is giving an ances-
tress a nice little boost every night. Gertrude
Rhead, the progressive maiden in the 1860
act, demurs at singing “Juanita” because she
“heard Madame Sainton-Dolby sing it last
week,” and her own performance would seem
to her so shocking by comparison.»
Typewriters of the haughtier variety are
feeling “real mad” with Emma Temple’s por-
trayal of one of their number. They say the
lady more resembles a factory ’and, and an
exceptionally loudly-dressed one at that. This
is not their first stab of the sort. A panto,
boy recently confided to the papers that she
consoled herself during hard theatrical graft
by thinking she “might have been Donndin
a typewriter’—as who should saj shovelling
sand or cracking road-metal. y snovelhn S

The dressing at Morphetville races on Saturday
was what one might term involved. Some wore

The good old Wolf of Want has not only been beaten
off the doorstep of the club house, but likewise
kicked to death, and its carcase has been sold. To
such good purpose did the committee put the boot in
during the preceding 12 months, that the membership
now totals 326, and the income from members’ sub-
scriptions is £163. Shrieks of applause.
Mr. Purnell, who has jpst taken charge of our
Public Library, was on the staff of the famous Bod-
leian, at Oxford, for six years, from 1897. He then
went to the Library of Queen’s College, Oxford.
Afterwards he undertook work in connection with
various public and private libraries, and was given
charge of the Central Lending Library at Croydon,
England. He has also cast a critical eye over some of
the chief Continental libraries. Do you blame this cul-
tured city if it reposes an almost childlike trust in
its new acquisition?
Miss Howard, of Fullarton, left for England in the

Dr. Jefferis met his eightieth birthday with a

The medical and legal professions were at logger-
heads in the Civil Court on Monday, when Mr. F. V.
Smith was cross-examining Dr. Kelmar, who is at war
with the Adelaide United Friendly Societies’ Dispen-
sary, or some such fearsome thing. Mr. Smith was
not inclined to swallow too readily some of the
medico’s technicalities, and said so ; but he got no
help from Judge Murray, who had “understood for
years” facts which the lawyer regarded with a
dubious eye—at which point the smile on the face of
the doctor was expansive.
The curates of the Outer Harbor met on Friday to
say good-bye to the departing Bishop Thomases. A
breakfast was consumed in honor of the fleeing
bishop, and, according to the local church paper, it
was a hilarious affair. Now, can a clerical breakfast
be hilarious?
Mr. T. J. Mitchell, who died at Woodville on
Thursday, was a colonist of over 73 years. He came
to Port Adelaide in the Ganges in ’39, and got a
billet in the Bank of South Australia, to which con-
cern he clung for 47 years. His original home was
a wattle-and-dab structure .near the west end of
Hindley-street, but he had lived at Woodville for about
33 vears. He was an unusuallv good classical
scholar, and could prattle cheerfully in Greek and
Latin. Also, he was a personage of some tonnage in
the Methodist world.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
“Rawlet” tells how the wind blows: —
Before polling-day there is going to be trouble in
the Liberal camp, and if Joe Cook wishes to quell a
rising rebellion against his “popular” leadership, he
ought to come to Victoria at once and kick his “fol-
lowers” into line. I attended a “Liberal” gathering
at Carlton the other night. Speakers: Sam Mauger
and F. O’Neill, billed as “Selected Liberal Candi-
dates.” Mauger was asked to mention the party he
belonged to. He answered that he was not tied to
any party; as for a leader he had none, and as for
pledges, he gave none, save his platform utterances.
O’Neill was next verbally inspected. Certainly, he
was njt a member of the Fusion party. He had no
leader either; “every candidate was a leader in him-
self.” Also, “Mr. Cook was only elected till after
the campaign, and when the elections were over they
would have another meeting to decide the leader-
ship.” Joe Cookism has ruined whatever chances
the Opposition ever had in Victoria. Alleged Liberal
candidates are afraid to mention their chief’s name
these days.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A profoundly depressed British blue book
announces that Bull’s little voluntary army
is now 84.800 men short of its nominal
strength. So if the long-threatened Franco-
German scrap breaks out this year, Britain
will have to help its French ally by sending
over two old women and a dog.
STRIKE-BREAKING UP-TO-DATE.
In New South Wales, under the Union Jack, we
are supposed to have constitutional government....
What we do find is a weak-kneed Government going
cap in hand to these evil-doers.... This is the kind
of Government we have got—a Government untrue
to its oath, and untrue to the people as
a whole, instead of a strong, firm Govern-
ment, everybody under the Union Jack has
the right to look for; a Government that will at
once set to work to punish evil-doers.... If a firm,
strong, capable leader were only to come forward
with the old flag in his hand, right side up, it
would be found that a vast majority of the people
would follow him, and nail the flag and its tradi-
tions to the mast. etc.
Sydney TELEGRAPH correspondent.
The good Fairy waves her magic wand thrice ,
and the demons of evil melt away like mists
before the wind.—Scene from a threatened poli-
tical pantomime.
“Eheu Fugaces,” his Lament: —
As a Conservative of the old school —one who has
never ceased to deplore the cessation of government
by the Upper Classes, and whose face has been set
steadily from the beginning against unionism, one
man one vote, and Radicalism generally—l would
like to draw the attention of The Bulletin to a
cable message of last week. It ran as follows:
“Mr. Lloyd-George, Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the Asquith Government, giving evidence before the
Marconi Commission, said: ‘I am a comparatively
poor man. The position of a Cabinet Minister is
precarious, and the glory is transient. Parties come
and go, and only the judicious make provision for
the future by investments. The whole of my in-
vestments have returned only £ ItOO in a year. I have
only one house, that in Wales, for which the con-
tract price was £2OOO. Surely a man of 50 can
have one house that he might call his own.”
Is ary further evidence needed of the rotten state
of affairs that prevails when the administration of
a great nation falls into the hands of Socialists?
England has come to a pretty pass when her Mini-
sters are driven to admit, on oath, that their pri-
vate fortunes are such as many a petty shopkeeper
would be dissatisfied with after a decade of toil. It
was otherwise in the brave individualistic days when
gentlemen ruled the land and Labor Parties were
unknown. Consider the position of a British Minis-
ter in, say, George lll.’s reign. Had he remained
satisfied for a moment with investments returning
£4OO a year he would have been regarded as marl.
In those days, as Sir George Trevelyan remarks:
“Everybody who had influence in Parliament used
it for the express and avowed purpose of making
or repairing his fortune.” This was a period when
“it was more profitable to be a member of a
Cabinet than the partner in a brewery.” Henry
Fox, the father of the great Charles James, did not
hold office for very long. But while he did he was
in a position analogous, more or less, to that of the
miserable Lloyd-George—he was Paymaster of the
Forces. Starting, in a financial manner of speak-
ing, almost from scratch, he rapidly put himself
and his family beyond the reach of want. In the
words of the historian: “Every new regiment that
was mustered, every fresh ship that was m com-
mission, every additional ally who applied for a
subsidy, every captured province or colony which
had to be provided with a staff of salaried adminis-
trators brought grist to the mill of the Paymaster.”
And what was the result? We find that bv his will
he was enabled, after living luxuriously for years,
to leave his wife £2OOO a year, Holland House and
Government securities to the amount of £120,000.
His son, Stephen, received between four and five
thousand a year in land. Charles got a property
in Kent and £9OO a year, and Henry an estate in
the North and £5OO a year. The sons also got
£50,000 in cash between them, and, in addition,
the debts of the two eldest, amounting to over
£200,000, were paid by their father. And all out
of the public purse! Can our statesmen do this
sort of thing nowadays? Certainly not! At the
first faint sign or hint of anything of the sort the
so-called democracy is up in arms, the gutter press
is shrieking like an inebriated fish wife, and the
loot has to be abandoned. The result is, we have
the Cabinet Ministers of the greatest nation on
earth living in villa houses and dying poor. If any
better proof is available of the sordid process that
is the ideal of the modern Laborite or Socialist—■
an ideal that leaves no scope whatever for sturdy
individual effort —I should very much like to be
supplied with it.
Thus Joseph Cook, leader of the Federal
Opposition, at a “rally” in Sydney the other
night:—•
Australia is a land of hope and glory, and will
remain as such until amateur politicians can make
it otherwise.
Yet the “professional politician” was, until
yesterday or thereabouts, the subject of so
much cursing by the papers which support
Cook that the smoke of their language was
like a burnt offering on Mount Carmel. Why
this change? Is Cook himself a professional
politician nowadays?
The wobbling Adelaide Advertiser pours
much grease over the S. Aus. Government
for abandoning the late Yerran Ministry’s
proposal to establish State brick works and
concluding a deal with a
private firm for a year’s
supply. The price is 10s.
per 1000 less than the cur-
rent quotation; and “there
is nothing whatever to pre-
vent a number of builders
pooling their probable re-
quirements with equally sat-
isfactory results. Of course
there isn’t. Yet when Ver-
ran proposed something
wholesale in the way of
pooling—in short, when he
proposed that the whole
State should co-operate and
produce its own bricks —the
Advertiser was horrified
at the wickedness of the
idea It was a most deplor-
able thing for 10,000 people
who want bricks to pool
tlieir probable requirements ;
but it is a most sensible thing for “a num-
P er (( £ f builders” to play the same game. One
is Socialism” ; the other—well, the other is
business.
It is a cold day now when N.S.W. doesn’t
float a loan in good old London. Its latest
effort has been to raise £3,000,000 at 4 p.c.,
i epaj able in 10 years. Each £lOO security
sells at £9B, which makes the interest some-
thing over £4 4s. A little scrap of extra in-
terest is thrown in, and there is the Bull
stamp duty and the underwriters’ commis-
sion and the sundries. So one way and
another, the Ma Prodigal is borrowing at a
rate that even a tenth-rate bank wouldn’t
dream of offering to its wildest depositor In
tact, there is many a faded building society
living up a back street which would think it
reckless to cadge at the price.
JOES EASY TRIUMPH.
Mr. Tudor (Minister for Customs) blamed the
Fusionists for having frustrated his attempts to ex-
punge the anomalies from the tariff. When he in-
troduced his Anomalies Bill....the Opposition whip
(Mr. W. E. Johnson) said: “So that there may not
be a misapprehension in the minds of the members
of the committee, or of my constituents, I wish at
once to dissociate myself from any approval of this
attempt to re-open the tariff and impose higher
duties.” This was the sort of talk the official whip
of the Fusionists indulged in over tariff reform.
News item.
THE ANGERED ONE : " So, after not doin' a
hand's turn since you took on th ’ job, your
only excuse is ”
THE LANGUID ONE: “’E wouldn't let me .”
The real trouble at the bottom of the
Sydney goods porters’ strike is the sudden
realisation that, though they do exactly the
same sort of work as wharf-laborers, they
are paid about half the price per hour,
being on weekly wages. Of course, the
wharf-laborer replies that his work is not
constant, and he has a lot of broken time ;
whereas the railway porter draws his wage
every fortnight whether he has lost time or
not.
There comes to hand the glad information
that the N.S.W. Government proposes to
“throw open” for settlement 84,000 acres of
land near Hay—as if the 84,000 acres were
a door or a bazaar or an oyster. It is a
grand idea, but so long as Hay is only
allowed to export its wheat and wool via a
port that is nearly 500 miles awav, and the
ports that are only about 200 miles away are
rigorously blocked under the Sydney conges-
tion policy, there isn’t much prospect for the
settlers in the 84,000 acres. If Twofold Bay
or Melbourne or Portland happened to be
“thrown open” to Hay the place might begin
to have a show, for it is really almost a
coastal area, but the State Frights policy
makes it almost as remote as the middle of
Siberia or the back yard of Timbuctoo.
Judging from his Parramatta speech, Joe
Cook utterly disbelieves in Protection. He
regards it as a ruinous policy for the coun-
try. But he doesn’t propose to try and save
the country in spite of itself by educating it
to a proper tariff view. Instead, he will
refer the matter to a referendum, and if the
country prefers, in its ignorance and blind-
ness, to go to the fiscal devil, he will cheer-
fully let it devil. In fact, there is nothing
Joseph won’t do for the 30 pieces of silver
that are otherwise known as office.
BORROWED PLUMES.
The Opposition leader made some caustic refer-
ences yesterday to the policy of the “third party,”
led by Mr. Beeby.
“Mr. Beeby has become a convert to the very
principles we have fought so hard for in Parlia-
ment,” Mr. Wade said. —Daily payer.
THE DUCK (tearfully); “ BOO-hoo! Yer mean
thing , yer nicked orl me bread.'”
THE CHICH (gaily): “First come, first served.
Pm orf ter ther Parliament'ry ball dis-
guised as a chicken sandwich."
ith a view to further persuading Aus-
tralians that their country is capable of doing
more intricate things than sitting on a fence
while a few sheep grow wool, the Associated
Chambers of Manufacturers are going to
hokl a series of All-Australian exhibitions,
fhe first is due in Melbourne in Septem-
ber next, and it hopes to keep going until
Cohen collects his winnings over the Cup.
The idea is, not merely to show made-in-
Australia goods, but also to have various
processes in operation, and to that end elec-
tric power is to be turned on free.
There promises to be some
agitation over the contes?
for the Plenty (Vic.) seat in
the lieps. Already three
candidates have come for-
ward, with a possibility of
the early arrival of Robert
Harper, who is still M.H.R
or about -to- be - abolished
Mernda. chose itti
candidate after lengthy de-
liberation In the beginning
the branches called for nom-
inations ; and presently pre-
sumably finding that poor
fish took the bait, tempor-
arily closed the proceedings
A ext, they again called for
nominations and chose a
candidate who withdrew for
“business reasons.” A third
cast, and a Federal public
servant came to the sur-
face. He, in his turn, de-
veloped a mysterious ‘‘ill-
ness,” and withdrew. At
this desperate stage, with
the elections onlv eight
weeks away, Labor decided
to count its second prefer-
ences on the latest ballot
and chose a Malvern painter’
who had been a previous
trier. Boyd, chosen by the
Women’s league; J. pp
IPewison, the selected of the
People’s Liberal party; and
the man are at this
stage the three declared candidates. Things
will be willing, in any case, and if Harper
comes out, they will simply hum.
The Queensland Railway Department fell
heavily on its officers over the Murphy's
Creek disaster. Usually in these cases it is
some insignificant person who gets the boot,
but, apparently, in Queensland they do
things differently, and a General Traffic
Manager and a District Traffic Manager are
in the soup. Both have been reduced in
rank, and one fined £lOO, to be deducted
from his salary at the rate of £5 per month.
The other is reduced £lOO per annum in
salary and fined £5O, to be collected at the
rate of £3 per month. This will be a sort
of epoch-marking case, and is probably about
the first on record in Australia where such
high officers have been dealt with so drasti-
cally. Still, the accident was a very bad
one —the sort of affair that no railway de-
partment could do otherwise than make
trouble over. And Queensland rose to the
occasion.
HOW CAME THE END—UNIVERSAL
ANARCHY.
And as their passing would be equivalent to a
political earthquake in Australia, every honest and
intelligent citizen should move heaven and earth
to condemn them.— Conclusion of a Bruce Smith
spasm on the Referenda.
THE LARGER PLANET “ ’Ere! Wot th'”
THE EARTH : "Sorry, but Mister Smith's de-
cided he couldn't tolerate this excresence on
the lower part of my face any longer
Parson Woodful], at Victorian Methodist
conference: —
If men are to be trained for mutilation and
slaughter, then it is best to go back to barbarism.
But that’s no good, because the barbarian
is trained for mutilation and slaughter, too.
Alas, Parson Woodfull can’t go anywhere in
this world to avoid the red-fool fury. And
the worst of it is he is quite satisfied few can
avoid it in the next, either.
The S. M. Herald (1/4/T3) told Prime
Minister Fisher what he ought to do: —
There is no hint that Labor may be defeated in
the coming Federal elections. The Prime Minister
does not admit for a moment that the failure of the
Referenda will be the greatest possible note of cen-
sure that his Government could receive, and that
under ordinary conditions of straightforward British
politics it would have to resign.
Two days later it told the electors what they
ought to do :
The voter will have to choose the body to whom
he is prepared to entrust the Government of Aus-
tralia, which is a matter of party politics: he will
also have to answer the questions of the Referenda,
and from these the element of party should be com-
pletely absent ....
When did the llerald know a Government,
acting “under ordinary conditions of straight-
forward British politics,” to resign because
a purely non-party proposition had been
turned down?
A SONG OF CHEAP DEFENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Strict economy has been shown by the Reform
Government in matters of defence. The cost during
Mr. Massey’s term of office has been, proportionally,
little more than half that of the Australian system.
—Glad shout from Maoriland.
The gun was cheap we bought to guard
Our backyard fence against the foe,
For powder we had much regard,
And bullets were but kept for show;
We would not waste our caps to fire
In practice for the coming fray,
Because it was our great desire
To make the country’s business pay.
And yet our lads were smart enough,
They held themselves with pride elate,
We felt they were the proper stuff
To smash the foeman in the gate;
But boots and uniforms were dear,
And we must keep expenses down,
And so we exercised them near
The quiet places of the town.
The angry scrub might tear their dress,
The rugged hills their soles destroy,
A very little carelessness
Makes an expensive soldier boy ;
We ran the whole Department cheap,
Economy was still our cry,
Our term of office would not keep
Until the shots began to fly.
The people’s votes had turned us down
Before the wrathful foeman came,
And then we had the fair renown
And our opponents got the blame.
The roll of death was rather large,
The landing place was hard to hold,
But those who perished in the charge
Forgot to mention they were sold.
And now with frightful haste and pain
The people mend the damage done,
And rush to man the breach again
Beside their new, expensive gun;
Which gives us an excuse to say,
To those who hold the seats we lost,
We made the country’s business pay
And you forget to count the cost.
For thus the game of party goes
In pleasing spells of turn about,
And we must use our country’s foes
To get the other fellows out.
A little blood perchance 7nay flow,
But we shall praise the men who die;
We claim we ran the cheapest show
Before the shots began to fly!

A BOON TO ATHLETES.
FOUND COMSTOCK’S NERVE AND
BONE LINIMENT MOST EFFECTIVE
FOR STRAINED MUSCLES AND
BRUISES.
The powerful, penetrating qualities of
Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Liniment make
it invaluable for a strained muscle or bruise.
Applied according to directions, it very
soon reduces a swelling from whatever cause.
“Being unfortunate at various times,”
writes Mr. E. A. Lang, of Oxford, Wollon-
gong Road, Arncliffe, “to meet with several
bruises and overstrain of muscle, sufficient
to render me incapable of fulfilling my ordi-
nary duties with satisfaction, I used only one
bottle of Comstock’s Nerve and Bone Lini-
ment on each occasion, and was able to con-
tinue work very quickly afterwards. On
one important occasion I was kicked by a
horse in the thigh, and though the bruise
was very painful, causing a slight lameness,
only half a bottle of liniment was necessary
to give relief and in a few days I was well
again. As a boon to athletes and skaters
for bruised limbs, strains and sprains, I am
sure nothing can be better.”
To be obtained from all chemists and
stores, or will be sent post paid on receipt
of price, 2s. 6d. per bottle, by The W. 11.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
City Tattersall’s Club distributed £2200
added money among the horse-owners at Randwick
on Saturday last, which was about £BOO more than
was passed out last year. It was a grey, still after-
noon, with rain hovering horribly along the horizon,
but the club had a bumper crowd, which probably
yielded it a record gate. The course, notwithstand-
ing the wear and tear of three days’ A.J.C. racing,
was generally voted good. The public got a bitter
smite in the Hurdle Race, with which the meeting
oper-ed. The field was five, and Gorlias, the aged
son of Gaulus, was loaded with public money till
he started at 10 to nine “on.” His rival right through
the race was the Maorilander, Merrie Laddie, who
went out at sixes, and they kept together till after
the last jump. Then the favorite was evidently
done, and the Maorilander ran home with 10 lengths
to spare, the favorite filling second place, with
Honey Bag third and away to glory. Seventeen
started for the Denman Stakes. Valido was the
popular fancy, and went out at sixes; but Patrick
O’Judas was in a generous mood, and did business
on some others at eight. The result was a bolt
from the blue. The winner, Malt Mary, appeared
suddenly from nowhere at the distance, and at half
distant:; ran through and won by half a length
from Lady Denman, with Mersina, who also carried
some public money, third. Lady Denman started
at the same price as the dubiously named Malt
Mary. Presumably if Malt Mary has a daughter
she will be called Beer Polly. The chief event of the
afternoon was, of course, the City Tatt.’s Cup. a
valuable utensil worth 50 guineas as well as £lOOO
added money. All this cash, and the sweepstakes,
with the exception of £2OO for the second and £lOO
for the third, is piled into the mug. Sixteen went
out to battle for it. The public rushed Hallowmas,
and he hardened to seven to two against. Cagou
was next at fives and Bernard at sevens; so it was
evident there were few on Bernard. Hallowmas
was first away, but Bernard quickly passed him,
with Cagou not far away. These three seemed just
then to include the winner of the Cup. At the dis-
tance Belove, winner of the Hobart Cup, took charge,
but Waltz, the imported daughter of Yorkshire Lad,
came with a rush. Bernard and Hallowmas fell
back, and the two mares fought a desperate race
with Offa, the gelding, straining lengths behind
them. It was a fierce finish, and Waltz won by part
of a head. Belove had started at eights, but Waltz
was soft at l‘Ve. It was a race after O’Judas's own
heart. Altogether Patrick had a pleasant afternoon’s
outing.
“0.K.”: Seems to me that “F.C.” (B.
27/3/’l3) libels himself when he describes his Flem-
ington Flat remarks in reply to mine of 20/3/’l3, as
“insulting.” They are too absurd to be in-
sulting. My paragraph was suggested by the
outpourings of a Footscray councillor and others,
who claimed for the public the right to enjoy a Mel-
bourne Cup Day picnic gratis on Flemington Flat.
I said that the Flemington racecourse show was an
expensive entertainment, provided by people who paid
to go in, and that nobody had a right to go in with-
out paying. “F.C.” says: “Now, will ‘O.K.’ tell us
what entertainment a Flatite sees? Has ‘O.K.’ ever
been on Flemington Flat? Absolutely the only en-
tertainment the Flatites get is what they provide
themselves. Most of them go there to bet,” etc.
To which I reply that the entertainment a Flatite
gets is a fairly close, or quite close, view of the
race at any point he may choose, whereas the paying
public gets practically no view of the race, except
when the horses are in the straight. A Flatite’s
view of jumping races is closer than the paying
public gets. I have been on the Flat, and I know.
Flatites go to the Flat to bet and see the races—for
nix. Standites and Hillites pay for going to the re-
serves, where they bet. Or they go for an outing—•
.to see the crowds. Well, the other people’s money
provides the show that draws the crowds. But for
the gate-money and subscriptions there would be no
races, no crowds, no sight worth seeing. As for
“F.C.’s” contention that Flemington should have
been under control of trustees like the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, I merely say that the M.C.C. ground
is a show-place where everybody has to pay for ad-
mission. The M.C.C. has never admitted the public
free to its flat on test match days, whereas the
V.R.C. has done so for 40 years on Cup days. Had
the club stewards been called trustees, they would,
presumably, have charged a bob for admission from
the verv outset.

Boyo Driscoll, the Welsh fighter, made
his first appearance in Sydney Stadium on Saturday
night against Charles Simpson. If he fights a
thousand he will never meet a pluckier, more fight-
hungry bull-pup than that sterling little Victorian
who was about a head shorter and half a stone
lighter. Simpson was naturally deficient in reach.
And yet what a fight he did put up. It was magnifi-
cent in its courage, and in the tenth Chapter it was
tremendous in its effectiveness. But excepting in
that tenth chapter he never had a real hope, for
Driscoll was his master all the time. He has a
beautiful left which he times perfectly, and moves
with all the piston-like grace which characterised
the left of Peter Felix in the days when Peter was
really Felix. He has a head-guard that is well-nigh
invincible, and that left is the soundest defence of
all. It is always in the place where it ought to be,
and Simpson literally dashed himself to pieces
against it on Saturday ni&ht. By the 13th he was
done. It would have been madness to let so plucky
a fighter get further knocked about in a hopeless
battle, so the Victorian towel fluttered in. Driscoll’s
left, if it keeps on as it has started, will certainly
become famous.
The two latest importations of American
boxers by Snowy Baker for the Svdney Stadium
bear out his promise that only superior men are to
be brought out. It would be hird to find two more
gentlemanly youths than Stone and Thomas. They
were welcomed at a supper on Friday night, and
prove to be both men of parts. Stone is married,
and his third child is a wee daughter who arrived on
the planet after her father’s departure for Australia.
He has achieved fame outside the ring, and wears a
gold medal given in recognition of his bravery in
saving the life of a child at Savannah fU.S.A.).
His most famous opponent was Abe Attell, whom
he fought when that brilliant young Hebrew was
featherweight champion of the world. Thomas was
present at the 1908 Olympiad, where Mr. Baker saw
him win the world’s bantam-weight championship.
Although he has also met Abe Attell. and fought men
like “Knock-out” Brown, of New York, and other
big guns, his only defeat was at the mauleys of Jack
White, who won on points after 20 rounds. Both
will shortly be seen in battle array at the Rush-
cutter’s Bay home of the pugs.
The fact that Bill Lang is returning to
the ring ih Sydney to risk the loveliness of his
countenance in a combat with the English heavy-
V'-eiglit, Petty Officer Curran, is not a matter for joy.
In fact, it is a matter for a day of prayer and inter-
cession and general grief. This tendency of the pug
who has retired to come back and have one more bout
is not only harmful to his own countenance but to
the face of the country. Usually the Come-Back gets
an unholy walloping and the credit of the nation
suffers. And N.S.W.’s credit is already so bad that
the last loan cost nearly ii per cent.
Writer has heard of marriage as a remedy
for neurasthenia, but matrimony as an aid to pugil-
ism is a new thing. It was generally understood
that the sturdy Danish fighter, Battling Nelson, was
through with his ring career. Then he got married,
and departed for his honeymoon. Next he jumped
into a ring at Racine, Wisconsin, and attacked a
husky fighter named Sorenson for 10 rounds of a pair
of minutes each. Sorenson had an awful experience,
being knocked down four times and slugged almost
into insensibility. Nelson worked with all his old-
time skill and seemed faster than ever. Most of his
blows were landed on the body, which is an old
game with Nelson. He prefers to hit the body, as
he says the blows are just as effective on the recipi-
ent, and not so hard on the hands of the giver.
Nelson has always held it is more blessed to give
than to receive, and he has always taken great care
of his hands —a fact which is standing him yeoman
service in his attempt to come back.

American fight fans are not altogether
devoid of sentiment, it seems, and gave Leon
Ketchell, brother of the late Stanley of that ilk, a
rousing reception at the Olympic Club, New York,
on February 10. It was Leon’s first appearance in
the professional ring, and he seems to have swum
at once into popular favor. He is said to be a minia-
ture edition of the late middleweight champion, and
to have all his dash and skill. He got through his
initial 10-round mill with credit, and save for a
couple of eyes in deep mourning, was unmarked.

When the mail left New York, Tahmmy
Burns, a Canadian boxer who once visited this coun-
try and fought a forgotten nigger named Johnson,
was having a new kind of conflict. Tammy is running
a Stadium at the Canadian town of Calgary. The
Rev. Di. Marshall was trying to close it up, and
was going strong on the subject from the pulpit.
Tahmmy was going strong in the press. Marshall
said the fights at Burns’s Stadium were brutal, and
Burns retorted that they were not half so brutal as
the amateur scraps indulged in by the boys in the
doctor’s church gymnasium. Then Marshall made an
attack on Burns personally, and Burns got in a
reply. He challenged the clergyman to publish a
complete list of all his sins, and he would do like-
wise, and let the public judge between them. Just
then the mail left. It’s a weird scrap. Talking
about the ferocity of amateur boxers, there is cer-
tainly more gore and hair and fury in an amateur
tournament than in a year’s professional fighting.
The amateurs are over eager, and fight all they
know, whereas half the skill of the professional is
devoted to taking care of himself. Abe Attell is
evidently of the same opinion as Tahmmy Burns, for
when he opened a stoush saloon in New York he
announced to the public that he would stage only
fighters who were just coming on, struggling for a
place inside the ropes. Stars, he declared, and he
was a star long enough to know, are always stallers
who, nine times out of 10, impose on the public.
It’s a pretty revelation, but it hits the alleged
brutality of the professional ring right on the point
and the solar plexus simultaneously.

A sporting event called a ‘ swim through
Adelaide,” was inaugurated in chilly weather last
week. The course was from Frome-road bridge (by
the Zoo) down to the weir, measured as one mile
575 yards, and Moon did it in 40min. But, this
being the first time of holding, the time required
had been altogether over-estimated, and sundry com-
petitors, with nearly half an hour’s start, were” finish-

Saturday saw the commencement of the
13th and second last round of Sydney First Grade
cricket. Interest was somewhat dimmed by the fact
that the Rugby League started its practice matches
and those who' desired to watch form from the jump
threw cricket overboard. Moreover, all but three
clubs are right out of the hunt for the premiership
which fact has decreased the attractiveness of the
bulk of the matches. The clubs that matter are
North Sydney, with 17 points, and Redfern and Uni-
versity, which, at time of writing, are each 14
North Sydney met Paddington at' Hampden Oval'
and Paddington went to the sticks, where 163 was
knocked up laboriously. North Sydney had no
time to show its mettle, and when stumps were
drawn had smote two without losing any "timber
Paddington’s highest score was 39, accumulated by
Noble. His only good backer was Munn, who hit
35; so these two, with Sundries, were responsible
for about half the score. North Sydney is feeling
good. North’s best bowler was Middleton, who got
five sticks for 19 runs. Redfern and University met
at the former’s oval, where University coruscated
by heaping up 431 for the loss of nine wickets. The
boss scorer of the day was Barbour, who was reminded
by a section of the crowd of his doings in the gas
strike. He biffed 143, so the heckling did not seem
to disconcert him. Roy Minnett made 68 and Gregg
64. A shocking feature of liedfern’s play was the
existence of 32 sundries. Redfern’s captain should
buy anew pair of boots, and use them hard on some
of his men. The fact that Middle Harbor made
199 against Gordon, reflects little credit on the rank
and file, seeing that 120 were hit up by the not-out
man Gee, and after him the highest score was 17.
Gordon hadn’t much time, but it made good use of
it, and by the end of the light had accumulated 132
for the loss of one wicket. Trumper made 44, and
then fell to Randall, and Macartney carried his bat
for 67. Although Sydney’s highest individual score
against Petersham was Coffey’s 49, the rest of the
team lifted the tally to 213 with the help of 11
sundries. Burwood called on Waverley, and being
invited to make itself at home, bashed its host’s
bowling for 306. Waverley allowed the reply to
stand over till next Saturday. Glebe met Central
Cumberland at No. 2 Cricket Ground, and with the
help of Bardsley’s 114, put together 277, after
which Central Cumberland started with 19 for no
wickets. Parramatta’s best bowler was Cranney,
who took three Glebe wickets for 31. #
Sydney Grammar School XI gathered the cricket
premiership of N.S.W. Great Public Schools after an
exceptionally triumphant season. Of 32 matches
played, Only one was lost and seven were drawn.
The other 24 were occasions to whoop and indulge
in catcalls. The schoolboys’ averages revealed a
couple of shining lights in W. McLean and G. A.
Street. Mac piled up 1143 runs at an average of
45.72, and Street gathered 120 wickets at an aver-
age of 8.72 per wicket., #
With the hoofballers practising on most
Melbourne grounds, the locals at Fitzroy began their
semi-final battle against South for the Cricket Prem-
iership. Winning the toss, ’Roy went in and made
a promising start, notching 150 for a pair of wic-
kets ; but a large and anaemic tail failed miserably,
and when stumps were drawn the side was out for
225 If the weather holds fine South has now its
last chance and a "ood one. Simultaneously, on
the rugged ’Varsity oval, the Students, winning the
toss, sent ’W'ood to the wickets, and got the 11 out
for 176. That distinctly moderate score leaves the
Students with the thick end of the argument; but
neither the pitch nor the weather are things one
can swear by, so the finish next Saturday promises
excitement. _ _ _
While some 5000 spectators viewed each of the
above episodes gratis, an equal number paid . a
“sprat” apiece to see if Middle Park could raise
278 in its second innings scuffle with ’Roy foot-
ballers for the Junior Cricket Premiership. Park
couldn’t. One batsman made 23, another 10 ; the
rest laboriously compiled 32 among them. So ’Roy
won handsomely. Here endeth the Junior Lesson
for the 1912-13 season.

This writer isn’t quite sure whether it is
evidence of the increasing gentility of the great winter
game or of lovely woman’s tendency to push her-
self into the strenuous lifa, or whether it is merely
a pleasing specimen of feminine sarcasm, but in any
case he views with alarm, as Fat puts it, the fact
that a young damsel of Yarraville has applied to
the Yie. Football Ass. for an umpire’s license. She
states that she is athletic and hefty, understands the
game and has a good command of language. But
as there is sufficient “language” already on and out-
side the hoofball grounds, and as permission to
allow a woman umpire to exchange “remarks” with
players and barrackers might mean much exhilara-
tion, but would certainly mean very little football,
the Ass. turned the application down.

The Metropolitan Rugby Union, which con-
trols the electorate side of Rugby football in Sydney
as far as the true blue amateur is concerned, has
decided not to add to the clubs which battled for the
glory last year. The Y.M.O.A. recently clasped its
knees and begged to be allowed upstairs among the
great ones, but the M.R.U. coldly bade the Good
You-ng Men be content in that station of football to
which it had pleased God and the M.R.U. to call
them—namely the second grade. The M.R.U.’s
trouble is that it hasn’t got grounds on which to
play, the taller offers of the more heavily gilded
League having driven it forth from the places where
it once reigned supreme. The council has now re-
commended the purchase of new grounds, either by a
syndicate or by the Union. If a syndicate can be
found, well and good. But at present the general
impression about the Union is that it is absolutely,
stony, motherless broke. The struggling Australian
League managed to finance the purchase of a couple
of grounds, but it looks as though the M.R.U. will
have to confine itself to unoccupied spaces and dodge
the law by playing in George-street when the police
aren’t looking. It’s a grievous case of the glory
having gone up the flue.
The whole of the Rugby League clubs were
in the field on Saturday, and adopted the wise plan
of putting on two separate NIII’s for the first and
second halves. This was to give the young talent
a show to reveal what it was made of, and it turned
out a good idea. Also, the young referees were
given an opportunity, and General Oninion remarked
afterwards that they all did very well. The Horder
family, which is playing for South Sydney, showed
up well in the scoring, the three brothers scoring
six tries among them. Which shows that it is a
fine thing to be strong in the legs. The Rugby
Union clubs and the Soccer teams were also out, so
there is no longer any excuse for imagining that
summer is with us still. The God of Winter is
abroad. * * »
The wind was almost dead on Sydney Har-
bor on Saturday afternoon, and as the grey, unin-
teresting afternoon wore on it became beautifully
less. The big yachts managed to finish the Prince
Alfred Yacht Club’s Ladies’ race, Sayonara, Cul-
wulla and Yuelba finishing in that order. But the
Skiff Club’s General Handicap, for which 13 started,
had to be called off. The wind got so faint that the
problem of how to get home suddenly became
urgent. The Skiff Club hadn’t brought its bed with
it, and it didn’t want to sleep on the bosom of the
harbor.
The Paddon-Arnst match for the sculling
championship of Australia is right off. Paddon would
row only on the Richmond River, while Arnst would
scull only on the Parramatta. So in the end Arnst
lifted his deposit and let the matter go. What
people are wondering is whether Paddon is feeling
glad or sorry. There are grave doubts on the sub-
ject.

Although 15 championships were listed on
the programme of the recent N.S.W. Amateur Ath-
letic* kick-up, only one record was equalled, and
that not a world record. It was the 100vds., in
which E. R. Cox covered himself with glory by
devouring the distance in 10 sec. This placed him
level with those demigods Nigel Barker, Stan Row
ley, W. T. Macpherson and Duffey, so far as their
Australian performances were concerned. But it
did not attain to the dazzling eminence of the
9 3-ssec. put up by Duffey at New York in 190“> and
since then equalled by J. Donaldson, E. S. Donovan
and Dan Kelly.

Sydney bowling enthusiasts were not en-
thusiastic on Saturday afternoon. The weather was
against enthusiasm in any shape or form, except that
which might have accelerated a hurried departure
to some sunnier clime. Still the Pennant semi-finals
provided some good games, especially that in which
Lowlands (Newcastle) was defeated by Ashfield bv
the narrow margin of 103 to 101. City and Chats-
wood was a close thing, the bloated Metropolis win-
ning by 104 to 101.

When 11. Grandon dropped the job of strok-
ing the N.S.W. Eight Oar Crew for Adelaide, the
Ma State found itself in danger of being left. The
crew must be in Adelaide by the end of the month,
and there was no time to find anew stroke. Ma
was saved from humiliation by single sculls cham-
pion Harry Green, who threw up the almost certain
chance of winning the single sculls and offered to
stroke the crew. As he is a stroke of parts the
selectors were delighted, and Ma will be safely re-
presented in the Eights, but not in the single sculls.
Is it possible that rowing is in such a parlous state
in N.S.W. that it has only two men capable of strok-
ing an eight-oar crew?

The sport, business, or recreation of fire-
fighting in Greater New York is being conducted
strenuously. Motor traction is being introduced, and
while the old system is still allowed to go on its
smoky and erratic way, 45 new stations are being
created, 20 of which will be ready for occupation
early this year. Motor vehicles to the number of 85
have been ordered at a cost of about £140,000. They
include 31 combined chemical and hose waggons, 28
motor-drawn steam pumps, and 26 escapes of various
types. Nothing now remains but to organise a ser-
vice of aeroplanes to fly at the throat of any sky-
scraper which may dare to burst into flame in the
upper storeys.

Henry Hughes, the veteran handicapper
to the S.A. Jockey Club, Adelaide Racing Club, and
practically all allied bodies in S.A., and at Broken
Hill, too, has given notice of his retirement at the
end of the present season. He has been at the racing
game for half a century, has filled every possible
official position on the course, was starter at the first
races ever held at Morphettville, has seen every Birth-
day Cup and every Adelaide Cup (except the one
that was run in Melbourne), has been a professional
handicapper for nearly 40 years, and for 20 years
has made horse his sole occupation.

In other words, a real man—a man able to
stand up for his rights, if need be, and deal
out 'more than he receives.
You’ve surely seen many cases where
Might was Right, where a great gruff
“bully” unjustly attacked an inoffensive indi-
vidual.
Just imagine if you were to be goaded by
the insults of a bully until your self-respect
could stand no more. How would you get
on in the “scrap” that followed? Could
you stand up to your man, confident of your
ability to “out” him, or would you be ner-
vous on account of your lack of knowledge
of the noble art?
Now, to be'forewarned is to be forearmed.
You will do well in learning to box—in
knowing just when and how to hit—how to
stop a rusher —how to land a knock-out.

“Hori” meets the newest Prophet:—
Have just returned from Waimana (M.L.), up
on the borders of the Uriwera country, which was
the last refuge of Henare Maori when the pakeha
Government confiscated the rich coast lands in the old
war time. Across the river from the pakeha settle-
ment is Henare’s stronghold—the Waimana pa,
where Rua, the Kaiser Bill and Moses of the Uri-
wera, has his establishment. Rua is an unofficial
king and the very latest thing in prophets—nickel-
plated and geared for high speed. He can tell more
highly variegated tales of the rewards for good
Maoris than the most enthusiastic missionary would
dare to, and is, therefore, a very successful prophet.
It is a sight to draw tears of joy from a Mormon
elder to see brown brother drive through the
pakeha section of Waimana, with his train of
seraglio beauties, gentlemen-in-waiting, rough-
tailed ponies and pariah dogs. The great man him-
self leads the way, ensconced in a smart butterfly
gig, with the latest addition to the harem at his
side. Next follows the rest of the skirt-collection,
driven in a high-wheeled four-in-hand by the heir-
apparent. Behind the beauties come the nobles of
the court, with their spouses, in every variety of
vehicle from an open drag to the humble dray.
The costumes of the entourage, leader included, are
of the latest and most fashionable cut, and six-
guinea suits and silk gowns are in striking contrast
with the get-up of the humble cow cocky, who, in
dungarees and bluchers, trudges slowly past in the
dust thrown by the flying wheels of the procession.
Yet in six months’ time, when the proceeds of the
latest land sale have evaporated, those same haughty
nobles, gay courtiers and radiant damosels will be
glad to pick up from the billiard-room floor the
cigarette butt discarded by the rouseabout employed
by that identical despised cow-pakeha, who happens
to have the knowledge, denied to them, of the uses
to which a banking account may be put.

“IWAN” Post-Hole Diggers
build firmer fences.
Because the “IWAN” bores the hole just big enough for the post
—thus you have practically no ramming, and the fence is firm
right from the start.
On the other hand, digging post-holes with crowbar and spade,
you must dig a hole at least 2ft. in diameter to get the required
depth. Consequently, there’s a heap of earth to shovel back and
ram; the post takes a long while to set, too.
Now, the “IWAN” digs post-holes just three times faster than
a crowbar and spade; is easier to work and easier to buy.
Where you only put in chains of
posts with bar and spade, you can do
18 chains with the Iwan Digger.
Empties with a shake, and by fitting
' extra pipe to the upright bar, the Iwan
bores to 35ft. No man wants to rack
!■ ■ o"K.d back and arms with out-
of-date fencing methods —get an

“IWAN” has no adjustable parts to

TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by. this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover
postage by the wholesale representative, H. A. God-

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
So notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
Hostile: Please mention those “imported
blocks” you’ve lately “seen” in The Bulletin
(reading columns), and we’ll send a tenner to your
local hospital for each one of them. And when you
can’t mention one, we’ll have the pleasure of calling
you 10 different sorts of liar.... The Grafter: You
“don’t know whether it’s poetry or prose.” To us
it looks like an infuriated beetle that had just
crawled out of the inkpot.... Parox: “Supper Clubs”
pleasant jingle ; but the point needs sharpening... .
W.W.P.: The cob story is ordinary and devoid of
human interest. .. .K. 8.: Well, what’s the matter
with you? You say The Bulletin was “hardly cor-
rect” about the N.S.S. Co. and its engineers, and to
prove your case you quote the very paragraph. Go to.
.... Missie: This lot not up ; but you ought to have
heaps of good Abo. material... .J.D.P.: Too me-
chanical F.W.D.: The plea for the forests is good
sense, but appalling verse. .. .T.C.: Things like “Out
in the West” should run smoothly or not at all.
Yours jolts horribly.... P.H.O’D.: “Swaggie’s Ap-
peal” is easy, lazy verse, without a fresh thought in
it. . . .Cleido: The subject is good enough, but the
whole thing would have to be re-written. . . . Jas. M. :
Another man gave us some better “Australian lan-
guage” verse the other week. .. . A.S.K.: You cannot
rhyme “stinkful pride” with “stands to gibe” in this
paper.... 8.C.: Glad your love brings you nice
dreams. It’s a way they have. . . .L.L.: Poor verse.
....A. Field: It doesn’t arrive. .. .M.L.: “My First
Place” could have no possible interest for anybody
in Australia. . . .A.H.: Very crude yarn. Now, if the
fossil had robbed the tart of that fiver to teach her
not to trifle with the affections of elderly married
men, there might have been poetic justice or some-
thing in it... . Bellerive: We like your brotherly
tribute to the late George Essex Evans best: —
After a painful illness he —
Crossed the bar,
George Essex Evans the —
Poetic star,
Divine were he’s inspirations,
Which established his fame,
As a bard he achieved
A high literary name,
Life fadeth like a leaf
On a wintry tree,
Early departed the author
Of the secret key.
....Caro: “Poppies in the Grain” doesn’t appeal to
us F.B. : “A Summer’s Dawn” is too slight,
although quite well done P.F.: “Two Love
Songs” rewarded for their moral qualities by being
handed to the office Wowser to sing.... Manin : Not
quite good enough. .. .C.C.: Poor yam told without
skill M.A.K.R.: Craftsmanship imperfect and
ideas very thin. .. .M.P.: “Dan” is quite hopeless.
.... Tas.: Moral reflections on ham-and-beef shop
duly noted. .. .W.H.: The office Wowser is still sob-
bing softly over his beer. .. . G.G.: “Aged Forty-
five” is melancholy business. That is just the age
when Rosa should begm to appreciate you
Charlie S.: Yes, we will discourage you gently—
with road-metal, if necessary. .. .W.W.R.: The only
thing “The Public and its Streets” requires to make
it cheerful is an extension or wing or something of
about another 68 verses.... Mac: Verse is not your
strong point. . . .A.K.: Heaven knows exactly what
it is about. We don’t, but we will swear that
“wrought” doesn’t rhyme with “court.”.... Manin :
Rather a faint sort of thing with a pale autumnal
moan in it. .. .G.V.W.: (1) It was too like the
other fellow’s story, despite the application; (2)
the charge was correct, according to Customs regu-
lations D.L.T.S.: “Knight” is out-of-date
Splodger: There is something rather taking about
your sturdy, downright style, Splodger, but as a
critic of the Bench you are, if we may say so, Splod-
ger, out of your element; in fact, rotten. Griffith’s
reputation does not rest on his efforts in Constitu-
tional cases. The High Court only deals with about
one cause of this sort per annum. Make a note of
this, Splodger. . .Querist: Certainly, a dog is allowed
its “first bite” in the United Kingdom; that is to
say, the injured party, in order to get redress, has
to prove what is called “scienter,” on the part of the
owner of the animal’s savage disposition. Unless it
has previously gnawed someone else, the owner is
not assumed to have had scienter. .. .E. Reynolds:
The balance was mostly made good by floating loans
in England. The borrowed money didn’t come out
here. It was simply used in London to meet Aus-
tralian liabilities of one sort and another, by that
wonderful process called exchange. If you owed £1
to a man in Birmingham, and sent him a post-office
order, it was probably paid out of the proceeds of
one of McGowen’s loans, or Scaddan’s loans, or
Massey’s loans. Any blamed or blighted or blith-
ered old loan would" do. .. .Brumby: A little on the
relative merits of the cow’s and cat’s diet goes a
long way, and we’ve as much on our plate as we
can digest at one meal.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.C.M.: Plain rotten. .. .G.A.T.: Gag has been
wandering around too much, and has got sore feet.
. . . .Sarto: After deep thought and bottomless cogita-
tion, the subject has been given up as an incom-
prehensible job 5.C.8.: That “one cow” iest has
seen too much wear and tear. Also, the mother-in-
law jest is DEAD. Incidentally, Queen Parysatis
was a notorious mother-in-law in Persia lon™ before
the Christian era. . . .R.E.: The bad egg jest has been
used up in practically every shape and form....
E. 5.1.: Received your letter, saying that you forwarded
two pictures. Received two pictures without name,
address or signature, and two with only an illegible
hieroglyphic in the corner. Tossed up to see which
lot was yours. Both are horrible. Also, both sets
of gags are un-original or chestnuts. Consequently,
both of you are requested to cease contributing....
Amateur: The pen doesn’t matter; but you must use
Indian ink.... Frank A.: You might turn the gag
into an Abo. par. Can’t suggest anything useful
that you could 'turn the drawing into.. . .G.S.: Shows
promise—try again E.P.: The pianist is too
obscure to "be worth space. The other picture is
simply the old misery—two plain figures and a
statement below to the effect that one is saying
something or anything or nothing to the other. They
are mere fashion-plate girls, and you don’t even de-
pict one with her mouth open to show who is speak-
ing. .. .1.0. U.: No good at all. .. .L.McD.: Chucked.
The Law has a long arm occasionally.
Five years ago Carmody, of the Victorian
Agricultural Department, was walking home
when a party of three gentlemen smote him
at North Fitzroy. Two of them were
gathered in and did a “stretch” each. The
third man fell into the hands of the police
the other day, was tried, found guilty, and
remanded for sentence. One of the two who
had done a “stretch” appeared as a witness
and swore the third man had nothing to do
with it, the witness having been the sole
assaulter. Unfortunately for the prisoner
there was outside evidence, which had not
done a ‘“stretch,” to the effect that the third
man had taken an active part in the
assault; and it looks as though the name of
of the third man is Slush. When a five-
year-old crime suddenly rises up like this
and catches a bloke on the chin, it produces
a lack of confidence among the battery
classes which is liable to have a bad effect
on their branch of industry.

The American Ring Pulveriser
is designed for
Crushing and pulverising limestone, lime, coke, ore,
brickbats, sewer pipe, terracotta,. glass, quartz, phos-
phate rock, sandstone, gravel, tile crockery, flint,
manganese ore, oyster shells, stove lining, shale and
all other refradtory materials.
Made in Six Sizes.
The various sizes are made with a view of meeting
the requirements of the small, medium and large
consumer.
Crushing and Pulverising to Fines.
Those materials of a refradtory nature can be fed to
the machine m 3m. to 6m. cubes and smallei.
The several degrees of fines are secured by installing Grate Bars containing interstices of various widths. A measured
decree of fines is secured by running the materials over a given mesh screen, returning the rejedtions to the Pulveriser. The
coarser the grind the greater the tonnage capacity, while the finer the grind the smaller the tonnage capacity. The more
dry the material is made, the faster and finer the machine will pulverise.
Strength and Durability.
Careful observations, based upon adtual experience, have resulted in adding to and making extremely strong all parts
of the machine. Extended research and grinding tests year in and year out have brought about the use of Manganese Steel,
a metal that will best resist abrasion and withstand the greatest impadl.
We shall be pleased to show you these in operation in Sydney. Send for Catalogue.

The above clearlv shows Results from a Short Course ot my True hair-Growlng Compound
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time—yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing.hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing »com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Vic.”: Mackay, our Government forest conservator,
read a trenchant paper to the A.N.A. conference on
the subject that fills his days. Of all continents, Aus-
tralia has the smallest forest area. According to the
statists, the total is about 100,000,000 acres, or 5 p.c.;
but Mackay insists it is under 4 p.c. The U.S. of
America took 250 years to bring their forests as close
to the verge of destruction as Australians have gone
in 70 years. The great Victorian Otway and Strz-
lecki forests were virtually destroyed in 30 years.
Nor are,we keeping a tight hand on what is left. Of
Queensland’s forest area, under 3,250,000 acres are
set aside for timber supply, and no portion even of
that is inalienable. In N.S.W., with forests esti-
mated at 15,000,000 acres, settlement is steadily
biting into, and destroying, large areas. Victoria’s
forests are commonly given as 11,800,000 acres; but
Mackay, who ought to know best, declares that the
true area is less than 7,000,000 acres, and that much
of it is greatly damaged by fire. Plantations of pine
and fir will soon reach 20,000 acres; but this is not
a tenth part of what there ought to be, because Vic-
toria pays annually about £750,000 for imported
wood. Tasmania has about 65 p.c. (11,000,000
acres) under forest. South Aus. has a very small
area, with less than 147,000 acres reserved. Wes-
tralia has 20,000,000 acres; but this, again, is subject
to extensive timber-cutting licenses. The annual ex-
port amounts to £1,000,000, from which Govern-
ment receives a revenue of less than £45,000. The
export cannot last beyond 12 or 15 years. And
then— ?
Maori land has grown so dissatisfied with London
as a distributing port for the frozen jumbuck that a
determined effort is being made to have all the pro-
duce of the Shaky Islands sent to Bristol. And, of
course, Bristol is willing. Indeed the western Brit-
ish port, which was once the second in the island,
and ha'd nearly all the ‘long-distance trade, has been
so_ stirring itself dp lately that it has spent several
millions on its wharves and river, and is now reach-
ing out both hands to Maoriland in the name of
Empire and commission and petty cash.

“8.N.F.”: Everybody wondered what ex-Minister
Nielsen. (N.S.W.) was doing to earn his “expenses”
while in America. A recent report throws some
light on the subject. From that and the illustra-
tions reprinted in a weekly paper, I gather that the
peregrinator was inspecting ferry services. There is
a nice little 'picture with a long description of San
Francisco’s ferries. The' picture shows a very old,
beam-engine boat, belonging to the Southern Pacific
Railway Co., whose craft are the joke of San Fran-
cisco. They are. used bi' nobody who can get on the
Key Route service. The latter has up-to-date boats
with a screw at each end, and they can pass the
S.P. boats any old time, besides which they are sup-
plied with modern conveniences. Compared with
even the Sydney ferries, the Southern Pacific boats
are modern only so far as their fittings go.

Judge Williams, of Maoriland, has said his say
on the important Brighton land case, and his deci-
sion is one to bring temporary cheer to Premier
Massey. Brighton, for his payment of £47, cannot
acquire the £13,000 worth of coal below the sur-
face, but only the surface rights granted by his
original lease. Yet Massey’s Act of last year ex-
pressly stated that Brighton could obtain the fee
simple of his land. Ward’s Act had previously
laid it down that he could have the freehold of
the top layer only, with all mineral rights reserved
to the Crown. Now, if Massey’s fee simple only
meant the same thing as Ward’s top layer with
reservations, what in the name of Cohen’s mortgage
did Massey mean by altering the old Act at all?
The debate which raged over the question was, on
Judge Williams’s decision, only so much hot air,
for which the country had to pay.
* * * *
The Australian Government’s decision to replace
the copper penny and halfpenny with smaller nickel
coins threatens disaster to certain representatives of
Private Enterprise and some small expense to the
Post Office. The “brown” at present in use is an
unnecessarily massive article, and when a man has
to transport a dozen or so he becomes temporarily
lopsided, and walks as though he had a boil on his
spare rib or thereabouts. The new coins will be an
advantage and a blessing to weak-kneed persons,
but they won’t be any good to the slot machines.
There are quite a number of these contraptions
about Australia’s various cities; and the larger gas
companies own a lot of them —the big Melbourne co.
as many as 23,000. The proprietors of the weighing
and cigarette and lolly machines are in worse case,
for they don’t make the huge profits of the gas co.;
but so far there has been no wail from them nor any
lament about “capital being driven out of the
country.”
* * * *
“Star”: The American Musical Burlesque Co., in
eruption at Melbourne Bijou, makes an obtrusive
display of one number, a song and chorus, laboriously
extolling a coming “World’s Fair” in a Yankee town.
It doesn’t belong where it is, and is obviously a
large advt., for which the authorities provide ade-
quate remuneration, no -doubt. Three or four years
ago I advised Australian Governments, rabid to ad-
vertise their States, to subsidise Australian plays,
and send them “abroad” with laudatory statistics
judiciously mingled with the heroine’s woe and the
wicked man’s villainy. It is plain that America
has taken kindly to the proposition, and this yap
about the exhibition is the first -instalment of a
long series of ads. designed to decoy dollars from
Australia to the land of Sam.

“Ricardo”: Margarine is again seriously threaten-
ing the Australian butter trade. The import to
Britain in 1912 was 1,352,427 cwt.; of butter (from all
sources), 4,005,159 cwt. Very nearly as' much mar-
garine as Australian butter was landed on J. Bull’s
docks, and far more margarine than butter is made
in England itself. Altogether, the consumption of
the mess is estimated at one-third that of butter.
Worse still for us, Danish butter does not fear
margarine; it is the Australian and Siberian imports
that suffer, because of their poorer keeping quality.
As to price, margarine is retailed at Bd. to lOd. the
lb., reliable butter can hardly'go under Is. 2d. Nor
can a stone be cast at the wholesomeness of the stuff;
in fact, the Glasgow corporation chemist states that
the use of vegetable oils, chiefly cocoanut, brings
margarine well within the range of pure butter as a
food, while as for taste only an expert can distin-
guish—-and he often has to rely on texture as well.
WRITTEN ON MY INCOME TAX FORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In pursuance of the Acts, and the regulations
thereunder, every person in receipt of income within
the meaning of the said Acts is required to fill up
the following return, and deliver the same at, or
forward it by post to, the office of the Commission-
ers of Taxation. —Horrible official warning.
The Old Year’s gone with its joys and sorrows;
The cash it brought me has also fled ;
The young New Year with its blank To-Morrows—
Mere calendar leaves—hangs overhead;
The week days black and the Sundays red
Look down upon me like great birds waiting;
These kites and vultures must 4 all be fed ;
Their endless appetites I am sating.
Into the sunset the last flock wavered
On weary pinions that slowly flapped;
Below a hideous curse I quavered;
In bills receipted my wounds I wrapped.
Oh, but my anguish with ease was capped
When out of the east came fresh ones winging i
Their hungry beaks on the trees they snapped.
(Their raucous croaks in my ears are ringing! 1
Butcher and grocer, milk-o and baker,
They’re waiting all for their pound of gold!
The watchful shades of the moneymaker
That follow—follow till he grows cold 1
No coins are left in the purse’s fold ;
My gains are nil for the long year’s raking.
Yet my lost income must here be told,
While this year’s vultures their meed are taking!

BRISBANE.
IN BANANA LAND
On present appearances Bananaland
Assembly will house another member of the
Bell family. Wienliolt, having quitted Fassi-
tern in order to win the affections of Wide
f?ay, by boxing two rounds with all comers,
there is a rush of “Liberals” for the State
seat; but E. T. Bell, of Coochin-Coochin
station, looks like an easy winner from the
crowd. The Bells’ reputation for scatter-
ing money freely will tell in a purblind dis-
tnct which clung to Wienholt because that
wealthy young man handed over his Parlia-
mentary remuneration to the local hospital.
Brisbane Oddfellows are up against a
bi am-racking problem. Women are rapidly
pushing their way into the most recondite
mysteries of Oddfellowship, and now the
awful question has arisen, “Can a woman
be a Noble Grand?” Up to date, the Bris-
bane conference has said “No,” but it has
said it to a sex -that read the story of the
importunate woman when it went to Sun-
day school, and hasn’t forgotten the lesson.
Now that the millionth male Eureka
otockader has gone to his reward the
women are coming along with vivid stories
of their part in that famous riot. Two old
ladies have just written to the Courier
giving their experiences. One of them pro-
duces a flattened bullet which whistled bv
her head during the battle. And, even if
anyone were inclined to doubt a lady’s word
there s no disputing the bullet, of course.
Queensland’s new Liquor Act got to busi-
ness on April 1, and Bung has fallen upon
evil days. While the Law is looking, lie
cannot now serve any person under 21 with
liquor; blackfellows, lunatics and Kanakas
may get no drink; women are prohibited
customers. The whole grog business must
henceforth be conducted strictly on a cash
basis, no debt being recoverable by law.
Lambing-down is henceforth an impossi-
yi~ ty , ( so it is alleged), for when Jimmy
W ire l ence . Pl an k s his cheque he must
get the change immediately—no putting it
j? the till and . telling Jimmy in 48 hours
that his deposit is exhausted, and that it
is time for him to take the track with a
bottle to comfort him.
“McNorth,” from Thursday Island :
Here the banging of hammers and plug-plug of
oil engines driving circular-saws in the Jap boat-
slips, mingle nicely with the tones of the Sabbath
church bells. The law that was passed to prevent
sweating and kindred evils is flouted in the most
flagrant manner by our brown brethren. If Bill
Smith mere white man, wants to build a fowlhouse
da^A e n ha ? t 0 obtain a Permit. No one
interferes with the Jap; apparently, he can do as
he pleases, and he goes on systematically doing it
The consequence is that the Jap has got the whole
ot the boat-building industry in his hands. White
carpenters cannot compete with his long hours and
short wages; they are objects of derision if they
even attempt it. A walk along Thursday’s main
street at night will reveal more instances of colored
brothers indifference to the voice of authority. Jap
tailors! shops will be seen to be illuminated, and sit-
tmg in full view of passers-by are the workmen mak-
ISlpClothes for white residents who profess to be
White Australians. The Chow does much the same. Some
time ago the Early Closing Act was enforced, and
Ah Sin was informed that he would in future have
to close his stores and workshops at 6 p.m. . instead
ot 8 p.m. He blandly agreed—but opened two
hours earlier in the morning. So far nobody has
lemonstrated, and it looks very much as if nobodv
cares to..
How are the mighty fallen! Brisbane,
once the home of Brunton Stephens and
minor bards innumerable, couldn’t raise a
solitary poem worthy of the prize set apart
for a lyrical effusion at the local Eistedd-
fodd.. Nine sets of verses were sent in, but
the judges looked at the nine—the tuneful
Nine— and said “We pass !”
A retiring president of the Methodist con-
ference haughtily told a Bananaland audi-
ence the.other day that the pastor&and mem-
bers of his show could ao without Fisher’s
baby bonus plasters.” Considering that
Methodist parsons get £8 a year extra for
every child they own, and that 99 p.c. of
them eagerly snare it, the saintly potentate’s
jest was, to put it mildly, out of place.
Though the Liberals nowadays make some
pretence of enthusiasm in matters of De-
fence, at heart a big section of them are
just the old let-it-sliders. Thus, Finlayson,
M.H.R., told Ipswich the other day
I believe there is no nation in the world to-day
that wotjld invade Australia.
Presumably, every unprepared nation that
ever was invaded, fooled itself with those
words. Korea was certainly saying such
things only a few years ago—and where is
Korea now?
QUEENSBURY RULES.
PEACE-MAKING PUBLICAN : “Don't -take no notice. He's drunk, and he’s a big Jellow
to boot.”
STRANGER: “Dam nit, man! D’ye think I kick when I fIGHT?"
Arnold Wienholt, Liberalism’s black hone
against Andy Fisher, is of German extrac-
tion. His father misrepresented the West-
ern Downs electorate with Robert Ramsay
in 1871. He married a daughter of Dan
William* who built the first section of the
Toowoomba-Warwick railway at the close of
the ’6o’s. Recent mention of Arnold’s pugil-
istic efforts recalls that he is a daisy at
electioneering. He beat Jenkinson out of
sight for Fassifern by promising his salary
to the local hospitals, going around rigged
up _as a cowboy and yelling “Hoch der
Kaiser” in his spare moments. The latter
stfint told in the frequent centres where Pots-
dam was a mor£ familiar name than Bris-
bane.
Having had a few months’ trial of things
sinc£ the old C. D. Act was repealed,
Queensland now finds that some action is
necessary; wherefore it is provided by Order
in Council that if the Commissioner suspects
any perspn of venereal disease he may re-
quire individual to submit to special
clinical or bacteriological examination. The
Order particularly specifies that men are
included. Properly and pluckily adminis-
tered, the Order (which is based on the
Health Act) should do an immense amount
of good—or, anyway, stop an immense
amount of harm.
Avignon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Twas in an old brown book I read it,
A heavy book with a golden clasp,
1 here were blurs of damp on the ragged
cover,
A stain of green on the broken hasp.
Avignon !” How the soft word haunts me
T , twittering pipes in the summer air,
Uelmate winds in the feathery grasses,
\\ hen light as a leaf the white moth passes
And dreams are everywhere.
Avignon! Was it hill or forest
Windy eyot or bough-blind way;
Cow white walls of a tree-girt city,
-Lhe word has followed me all the day!

Avignon,” when the stars are out!
And I turn in fancy the pages over
(The sun blood spotting the haze’s grey).
And dream the name as a twilight lover
Dreams the end of a burning day.
And over the creak of the saddle leather,
And over the red spur’s driving on.
Comes the croon of winds in the feathery
grasses,
As when the ghost of an old love passes
With a broken whisper of “Avignon !’-
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 5, 1913.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
His Ex. in a frock-coat (etc.), Lady
Macgregor in mauve, and the Vision in a de-
licious dove-grey frock, adorned the General
Hospital meeting on Thursday. Everybody
in the room, excepting the two official ladies,
spruiked. Her Excellency, however, filled a
gap by ladling out the medals won by the
useful nurses. Grey haired Nurse McDiar-
mid —the angel of the hospital, as she is
usually called—scooped a gold medal for
highest marks in her year.
The Indian Government, having issued a
serious warning to white Australian women
against marrying Afghans or Pathans, I’d
like t" know what the Australian Govern-
ment intends to do about it. At Mount
Gravatt, a few miles out of Brisbane, an
Afgharn hawker bought a few acres of land
opposite the State School, married a white
woman, and settled there. Then he cut his
estate up into small allotments "nd sold
them to his fellow-heathens. These followed
his example with regard to white wives, and
now a half-caste settlement with a Moham-
medan mosque in its midst, has sprung up.
There are too many palpable leaks in this
White Australia policy,, to say nothing of
the horrors that await our lost white sisters
when, as mostly happens, they are taken to
the Land of the Flowing Shirt-tail. Does
the whiteness of Australia end when we
block the landing of a percentage of Chinese
stowaways V
Fred B. Smith and Raymond Robins have
been straining -the ear-drums of the occasion-
ally-faithful in this city with a shriek en-
titled, “Men and Religion.” It seems a
hard, dry, weevily sort of exhortation, still
1 suppose it has its advantages from the
point of view of the eternally-peregrinating
plate. The show was opened by a sort of
banquet, saddened by the absence of the
cup that hiccups, but officially brightened by
the presence of George V.’s plenipotentiary,
who was supported by a subdued private
secretary. The holy Smith testified against
the indecency” of the Brisbane women’s
dress, and we feel so awed now that “trans-
parencies” arp off till the next fine day

Queensland s enervating climate received
a painful showing up the other dav when the
annual report of the Ispwich Technical Col-
rm passed round. Referring to the
that some of the State’s school-
teacher students had to surmount in their
efforts to attend the Saturday morning
classes at the college, it was stated that one
pedagogue left his far-out home at half-past
midnight, walked eight miles to the main
.no c . au Sbt a freight train and
l eached his destination about breakfast time.
But, with the weakening effects of the cli-
mate and the hardships of reaching the
centre of study, the best he could do was to-
head the list of Queensland’s Technical Col-
lege students in the subjects he took up. It
is all very disheartening. ,
F x '?VK r i ntend ® nt O’Callaghan got am
extra ±4oo from his pal, the Acting-Premier/,
on his retirement, '‘in recognition of his:
services to the State.” As the State has;
tor years been shouting most emphatic
expression to its dissatisfaction with O’Cal-
s s . ervdces > it may be assumed that:
±4SU is the. reward of demerit from John.
Murray s point of view, or else it is all that
IS .A. > after the demerit is deducted, of the
nnllion or two he intended to give O’Cal-
laghan before his uselessness became so
apparent.
The \ ictorian Board of Health has unani-
mously recommended that in the Health Bill
which is to be introduced next session by the
'\att-YVeary Government, a clause should be
included making it compulsory for those
about to marry to produce a clean bill of
health. The proposal has, however, been re-
cmved by John Weary with bleak and heavy
disdain, and the Argus has become morbidly
facetious about it. Yet thinking citizens know
that there is something illogical in health
laws which profess to prevent the importa-
tion of the unfit from without, while permit-
ting their wholesale propagation within. The
Argus tells the Board of Health “that, to'
avoid being made ridiculous, it should
devote itself to the objects for which
it was appointed, and not waste its
time in discussing and deciding upon:
matters which it does not understand,
ihe Tory sheet evidently never heard
ot that expert in these matters Havelock
Ellis, who remarked, “It is the task of
Social hygiene not only to make sewers, but
to re-make love.”

driving cars costing from to
And there’s a good reason for it. You
get in the 14-C-H the utmost in comfort,
in looks and in strength. You get power
sufficient to take you and your family
wherever you want to go, and faster
than you’ll ever want to drive. You get
an economy of operation impossible in

THE IDEAL COMBINATION FOR BOTH

MOTOR BICYCLE
FITTED WITH THE
B.S.A. TWO SPEED FREE ENGINE HUB.
Owing to its extreme simplicity there is little to get out
of order in the B.S.A. Two-Speed Free Engine Hub.
The three positions—Top Speed, Free Engine and Low
Speed—are each taken up with silent smoothness through
the movement of a single clutch, operated by a con-
veniently placed foot pedal. The single train of gearing
is always in mesh and, therefore, free from risk of
damage. Its proved reliability in town traffic and on
hills make it indispensable to every motor cyclist.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hog-skin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, ' 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/15/- Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle will
be forwarded freight paid. It is to be obtained
from J. P. Talty, 388 Sussex Street, Sydney.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking thie strain off them —the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
"f you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the W’ilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
Ihe Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you _ wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
liven a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

How’s This f ! r Genuine Cure?
This little girl whose picture is given below is the child of Mrs. M. Doogan,
No. 1 Ann Street, Surry Hills. The child had a most terrible burn on her back,
which it did not seem possible to cure. On February 3, l.Jlo, Mrs. Doogam wrote
us the letter printed below to tell us how thankful she was to think she had at last
found a cure for her poor little child who
had suffered so much pain.
You will see from the letter that she had
her child at the hospital for seven weeks,
and the doctors tried skin-grafting and gave
the little one every attention. However, it
seemed impossible to cure the sore and cause
the skin to grow again, and it was only as a
last resource that she tried Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, which has cured the burn and
caused the skin to grow in a most wonderful
manner.
That the burn was a terrible one can be
seen in the photograph of the scar left on the
child’s back, and everyone will agree that a
remedy which will so quickly cure so bad a
burn as this, a burn which had resisted
every other known remedy, certainly merits
the term “The Rapid Healer,” by which
Rexona is so widely known.
Since writing this letter Mrs. Doogan has
informed us that the child is absolutely
cured, and that healthy skin has grown en-
tirely over the sore. We are sure that all
mothers will read her letter with great. in-
terest, and agree with her that Rexona is a
necessity in every household.

FRIEND.
February 3, 1913.
The Manager, Rexona.
Dear Sir, —I cannot describe to you on
paper or in words how grateful I am to your
wonderful ointment, Rexona, for what it has
done for my little girl. She was burnt eight
months ago. She was in the hospital three
times for the burn, and skin grafted once
seven weeks ago. She was sent out of the
hospital as an out-patient. I used to take her
every second day to have it dressed; but I
was never let see the wound, as the bandages
were sealed on her. When I would ask how
it was, they would tell me it was getting
better. After attending for four weeks as an
out-patient, one morning I undid the band-
age, and I was horrified to find a big mattery
sore. I took her that morning back to the
hospital and asked for the doctor. A nurse
told me the doctor said if I wanted it to heal
I would have to put her in, and let her be
skin-grafted again. I was broken-hearted at
this after all she had suffered. I made up my
mind I would not let her go back any more.
A friend of mine asked me to give Rexona a
trial, so I went and bought a tin, and after I
had cleaned the discharge from the sore with
hot fomentations I applied the ointment. The
first week it made a wonderful difference, and
each day it kept getting smaller, until it is
only the size of a threepenny piece. It was
fully the size of a saucer, and it is only three
weeks and a half since I first started with
Rexona. I hope you will not be bored with
this. Rexona is worth its weight in gold to
me, and if you want any proof of this state-
ment, call on me and I will show you the

“Shaver.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS declaration that his name was
Edward Saunders is the one thing
to attest that Shaver had been ad-
mitted to the Christian fold. No one that
ever I could find knew more about him than
himself. And when he became one of the
group at Whylungela he was not old enough
to be an authority, even concerning himself.
There was a waterliole out in a back pad-
dock of the run —a bad paddock, too, rocky,
hilly, scrubby, useless, worse than useless,
for when sheep wandered into it they per-
ished ; wherefore we had fenced it off from
the rest of the station. It was seldom visi-
ted ; but it happened that one of my boun-
dary-riders was out in the Dead Finish pad-
dock, as we called it, in search of strayed
horses, and returned to tell me a sick travel-
ler with a little “kid” was camped there.
Next day I rode out with Bill, and found
the poor beggar who had halted in that
hungry desert. I was not doctor enough to
know his ailment or to help him much; but
he was very ill, no doubt about that. Per-
haps, if I had been a regular medico, he
would not have suffered my treatment; for
a more sulky patient I never met.
A wretched camp it was for a sick man —■
just a few bushes propped against the stump
of a dead tree. He lay wrapped in a single
blanket; a swag for his pillow. Outside the
mi-mi the accoutrements of a couple of
horses littered the ground ; at the fire were
a pair of tin pots. Food seemed scarce. All
this was not surprising to me; we see all
sorts and conditions of tramps, sick and
well and malingering, out our way, and the
pick of them don’t travel with much baggage.
The queer thing was that such a chap
should have a little boy with him, a young-
ster from eight to 10, I should say, a picture
of misery, too, poor little wretch. He was
as silent as the man ; I can’t say if he was
fond or afraid of him, but he never left the
sick man’s side. He was dressed in some of
the man’s old clothes —not so much dressed
as lost in them. His boots alone seemed to
belong to his size. I wanted him to come
with me to the station, but he refused. So
I left Bill with what I had brought for the
sick man, and directions to look after him.
I had a heavy post to dispose of next
morning, so that it was late in the afternoon
before I was able to revisit the camp. The
man was visibly near his end. He was
hardly conscious, and while we waited he
died, as silent as he had been all along. We
wrapped him in his blankets and protected
the body from interference; then, taking
with us the stranger’s swags, and mounting
the boy before me upon my horse, we went
back home. Next day Bill and another man
went out and buried the traveller, and
brought in his horses.
The swag contained no clue to his iden-
tity ; the boy knew him by a Christian name
and said: “Th’ ol’ man an’ me we wus work-
in’ our way down f’om Billylaringa, but Tom
fell sick, an’ got worse, an’ we ’ad to camp.”
I wrote to the manager of Billylaringa; he
knew nothing of the pair as I met them. I
questioned every manager for a hundred
miles round; but no one seemed to know
either the boy or his companion. Then I
sold the dead man’s horses ; and the money,
with a small sum found in the swag, was
put aside for the youngster.
What to do with the boy was the next
thing to decide. On this point there was
agreement at the station. Our cook and
laundress, Mrs. Honorah O’Connor, said:
“Sure, an’ ye c’u’dn’ do ut, to sind a b’y
awa-ay to th’ p’lice; ’tis a harrd toime ’e’d
have wid ’em, and turrn out bad. Ye’ll not
miss the bit ’e ates, an’ Oi’ll say to s clo es.
Bill’s wife, down in the hut, was of the
same opinion. Shaver shook his head when
I suggested he should go in to the troopers
at the township, and asked: “What for? I’d
rather stop here.” So it was agreed he
should stay on with us.
The two women fed and clothed and cared
for him, till they gave him something of the
air and appearance of a boy at his age. He
was tall, but strangely emaciated in face and
body, partly because of hard living. When
he was stripped, it was painful to see how
tightly the skin stretched over his ribs
seemingly their only covering, for flesh there
was none; to see the throbbing of the heart
and the fallen arch of the abdomen. Poor
little chap ! His lines had fallen in far from
easy places. Nor was he in countenance
the kind of youth who takes the eye with the
charm of healthy and 'contented boyhood.
His usual expression was neither wistful nor
melancholy, but self-contained. Frown or
laugh seldom crossed his face; his shrewd
eyes were watchful and steadfast; and he
had a notable talent for keeping his thin
lips closed.
About his past he never willingly spoke.
We ceased to question him when we found
he could not, or would not, tell much. The
men on the station called him “Shaver,” and
the name stuck, till he himself adopted it.
His allegiance was divided between Graham,
the young storekeeper, and myself, Alfred
Hurst, manager of Whylungera. Shaver was
too old to be interested in the toddlers down
at the hut, though now and again he condes-
cended to nurse and care for them at the
mother’s request. He did not like the job,
but he was grateful to his friends and kind
to everything. In short, Shaver soon be-
came a privileged person among u§. He took
his meals generally with Mrs. Honorah in
the kitchen, and he slept somewhere in her
kingdom.
As months went by, Shaver did credit
to the care of his friends. Young as he was,
he grew an accomplished horseman, and he
had a quick eye for the features of the bush.
He stood on good terms with the men, and
was accounted by them “a dashed handy use-
ful, good-natured little beggar, worth his
tucker, all of it.” Company of his own age
there was none on the station, so that
Shaver had to share the grown-up folks'
life. My fellows were very decent chaps,
from whom the boy could learn nothing
worse than a good deal of jocose experience
of the world, a few commonplace oaths, and
the tags and refrains of some music-hall
ditties five years old or more.
Other things indeed he learned. The men
taught him all that concerned the run, its
boundaries, extent, neighbors, roads, tracks,
paddocks, tanks, timber, and a world of that
close knowledge, based upon endless observa-
tion, which is the bushman’s stock-in-trade.
They taught him during the long evenings of
winter to play dominoes and draughts, crib-
bage and euchre and “nap.” He caught
their tricks of pronunciation, varied now and
then by Graham’s accent or mine. He
adopted their idea of music, and could lift
up a thin but steady stave on occasion, with-
out shyness as without forwardness. Step-
ping out to us if we were on the verandah of
a summer night, or to the hearth, indoors,
with the firelight upon his face, if it was
winter, he would drone his way through the
song, sure of applause. He learned to finger
the powerful English concertina of Adolf
Woltermann (better known as Peter the
Dutchy), when the owner of that esteemed
instrument was absent on duty. _ If there
was some simple jollification, a birthday or
anything of the kind, he got rather more
than he ought to have had of much-watered
whisky; and he could not have been 12. when
he came to me in a woeful state obviously
traceable to indulgence in a very rank to-
bacco pipe. _
Between Graham and myself Shaver
learned by degrees to read a newspaper and
to understand most of what he read there ;
also, he could write a serviceable fist, which
all who ran could read, and the same can
no man say of mine. He was wiry and
tough of body, if meagre still; he was sound
in wind and limb; he had shrewd eyes and
a tight mouth and a firm hand for bridle
or rein. When he did talk he had a clean
tongue and brief, his head was clear, he was
thoughtful for animals, and he was grateful
to his friends —that is, to everybody. I do
not care where a boy comes from, or how he
gets his training—if these things may
truthfully be said of him when he is going on
for 16 years I’ll stand to two things: that
the boy was worth his training and his train-
ing was the best he could get.
It was a long while before Shaver left the
station. Once at session time, having busi-
ness in the township, 120 odd miles south, I
went there, and Shaver went with
strict command to answer only to “Ned.”
We came in by coach, the station horses (it
was drought time) not being equal to the
journey. After a dusty trip we got in
safely, had supper and a wash, and went to
bed. It was later than usual when I awok»
next morning, and after my bath I pushed
open the door of Shaver’s room to call him.
Shaver wasn’t in. While dressing, I won-
dered a good deal, and coming downstairs I
made search of him. That was hardly neces-
sary. for very soon I heard his voice. Used
to ‘the early hours of the station, he had
got up quite early, before daylight, I think,
and had spent the first hours of the Sunday
in helping the groom for Cobh and Co. to get
the mail coach ready to despatch. This done,
and the stable, loose boxes and horses having
been minutely and silently examined, the
young man ingratiated himself with the girls
of the hotel by lighting their fires and bring-
ing wood for them. He was receiving much
detailed information about the inner work-
ing of a country hotel, from the servants
point of view, when I found him. Now 1
had long been on the best of terms with the
girls at my favorite hotel, which I visit',
about once in four months, but Shavers
popularity soon threatened or promised—
as you prefer —to surpass mine. -There
really must have been trouble if Shaver had
been at all impressionable.
Out on Whylungera we never saw a par-
son. Ido not blame them. Roads that way
were generally bad, sometimes impassable,
distances were long, houses few, people
hearty and hospitable, but not at all devout.
It is said that the clergy can only be per-
suaded to come outback by the temptation of
a good wedding fee, or at shearing, when the
men can raise a collection. So Shaver and
I went to church. It was not very far from
the hotel, and the neighborhood caused the
church-going bell to be heartily cursed by all
the late risers. Some of them said that only
for the splitting headache caused by that
bell they would have gone to church
that morning. Luckily the headache was re-
lieved after breakfast, for those who most
complained spent a cheerful forenoon with
cards and clouds of smoke and sundry com-
forting draughts in the snuggery off the bar-
room. behavior W3,s cxGmpl&ry.
He got the swing of the hymns and the
chants, and joined them out of liking for the
tunes; he stood up or knelt or sat with the
congregation; and during the sermon he
bestowed a friendly but searching regard
upon the preacher which once or twice came
near to disconcerting him. Then he would
study the few boys in front of him; as to the
girls' he was indifferent. That service gave
rise to a long examination afterwards. I
explained how it was that the church was
not intended for a place of residence, why
the parson dressed up in that rig, why some-
times the people said their prayers out loud,
sometimes the parson alone, and then the
whole mob of them, what they did with the
money, and was that what the chaps on
Whvlungera meant when they talked about
“shovin’ roun’ the hat?” Then the boy
added judicially: “I s’pose them fellows
there” (meaning the boys he had observed)
“go ’cause they like it, but it wouldn’t suit

the customary cases of fraud and so forth
were being hurried through by Judge and
Crown lawyer, anxious to close the sittings

trials for their own kudos and gain, lo

the: ever-ready healer.
Every mother realises to-day that a handy pot of Zam-Buk is
priceless boon. Zam-Buk is not only world-famous for its heal
ing. soothing and germ-destroying qualities, but gjves us for the
first time an ever-ready “first-aid,” uniting simplicity effective
ness and safety.
Simplicity.
-vvauoc.oicyuum uuneuwus preparation,
~ , needs simply to be taken -out of the not
"*th the clean linger-end and rubbed gently over the cut or sorp
when the fine juices sink into the tiny pores in the skin and ‘Vet
at’ the harmful germs that are lodging in the undier-tissues.
wi
Effective
Because Zam-Buk is prepared by methods en-
tirely different and ahead
of mere ointments and cheap salves or
‘ creams.” Because it is composed of pure
juices and oils, scientifically refined and skil-
fully combined. The uniform success of
/am-Buk shows that the ideally effective
balm has been discovered at last. ,
Safe
Because Zam-Buk’s active constitu-
ents contain no trace of rancid animal
tat, mineral irritant or poisonous acid. Because
Zam-Buk achieves its exceptional results
by methods quite different from fatty
ointments and cheap salves. Zam-Buk is
so pure that it suits the frailest invalid
and the youngest babe. It is the one and
only Zam-Buk.
Daily mishaps make Zam-Buk
a daily need ; and its instant ap-
plication on cut, sprain or sore
is a sure safeguard against blood-
poisoning germ diseases and all
the common complications of ac-
cidents and skin diseases.
A MOTHER PRAISES ZAM-BUK.
Mrs. S. M. Burgess, of 34 Cambridge
Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says: “For
such injuries as cuts, abrasions and
festered sores, and for children who are
always falling and hurting themselves,
Zam-Buk should be kept on a handy shelf
in every home. For chapped hands and
cracked lips caused by the bitter, winter
winds, Zam-Buk is a splendid remedy.”
Zam-Buk is invaluable
for eczema, ringworm,
chapped hands, chil-
blains. cold sores, piles,
and heals cuts, burns,
bruises, scalds and
scratches. Sold by all
chemists and stores at
1/6 and 3 6 per pot (con-
tains 3 times 1 6).
" RUB IT IN.**
Colic, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

I was attacked with severe shooting- pains across
the back which used to gripe me and make me feel very
miserable. They were brought about by liver com-
plaint. I took Cascara, and other medicines but got
no permanent relief at all until a chemist recommended
Chamberlain’s Tablets to me. I found that they gave
me relief at once and were especially beneficial to the
liver. They acted so well in my case that I was
completely cured after taking only a few boxes and am
now enjoying good health.”
J. W. Watkins, Pelichet Bay, Dunedin, N.Z.
make up for Shaver’s dull day we went that
night to a circus performance of the usual
up-country standard. As far as I knew, this
was the first time in his life that Shaver had
been present at such a display. The tent
was not large, or the company first-rate; but
the delight, the envy, the emulation which
they excited ! Not that the boy was at all
demonstrative. He sat among us in the
chief seats, upon a bench of rough hard-
wood, scantily draped with old coarse drug-
get, but he hardly stirred, his mouth was
firmly closed, while his eyes devoured all
which the ring displayed. It was a poor
show, certainly; you don’t get Barnums
in the backblocks. The japes were ancient,
the horses looked as if they wanted more feed
and more grooming, the men were red-
nosed, thick-spoken, and stiff in the joints ;
while the boys were ill-trained and cheeky.
But it was a revelation to Shaver. He
lost not a motion of the thin, wasted slip of
a girl in scant and faded finery who jumped
through the paper ring and kissed a mani-
festly dirty hand to us as she turned her big,
dull eyes unon the group which represented
the “boxes”; he was on tenter-hooks until
she had done her risky trick. It did not
seem to him a woman’s business to be a
bare-backed rider and control a horse to per-
fection ; that, in Shaver’s eyes, was a man’s
affair. Hence, perhaps, his keenest interest
was given to the girl. He watched narrowly,
but with a more indifferent air, the lads of
the company, whose spangles glittered in the
light of a ring of guttering candles overhead,
whose unyouthful faces met our eyes as the
riders swept round the ring in the flight of
their cantering horses; while their harsh
voices goaded on the animals as the ring-
master’s whip and the thought of to-morrow
goaded the riders.
Shaver smiled upon none; he heard the
clown’s sad jests without an alteration of
countenance; you might have thought him
quite indifferent. Ah, then, you should have
seen and heard him in our horse-yard the
Sunday morning following, when he did half
the tricks for the station hands at home, re-
peated confidently strings of patter of which
I could only recognise a word here and there,
mimicked the clown, the ringmaster and the
few remaining performers, and described
minutely the various costumes of the mem-
bers of the company. There is but little
that interests him which a bushman’s keen
eyes miss or ignore, which his eager mind
fails to record or his faithful memory trea-
sure permanently.
* * * *
Time passed. Three years later, Shaver
was grown out of his name. He was tall
and straight; thin, as of old, but no longer
with the attenuation of want and neglect;
he was now a young man who got a warm
glance from every woman on the roads and
the stations. The same frank true eyes ; the
same oval face, bronzed by sun and weather
in his out-of-doors life ; the same firm, closed
mouth; all these were unchanged. But he
had grown a moustache, heavy, black and
curling, though the strong chin and lower
jaw were shaved. He had the practised'
horseman’s slight stoop of shoulders and flat-
ness of chest, thin flank and firm, full thighs
with their powerful grip of the saddle. In
his saddle or out of it, he was as fine a
young Australian as could be seen. Brimful
of health and pluck, with a temper naturally
kind and slow to be provoked, yet, once offended,
implacable; good company with all he met;
by choice a bushman and best pleased among
men of his own class, but bearing himself
gravely and simply in the best society of the •
district; I tell you I was proud of my pupil.
In our journeys we sat together at the same
table with men of all conditions —squatters
like myself, their wives, their girls and boys,
Government officials, drovers, surveyors,
commercial travellers, sheep buyers, Wool
agents, and all travellers of the western
roads. Young as he was, I never saw him
at fault. He dressed as I did, in the rough,
strong tweeds that stand hard wear in the
bush—loose, open coat, half-buttoned vest
over a cricketing or tennis shirt, trousers
made to be comfortable in the saddle, neat
boots of soft leather, a loose grey hat of felt
upon his head —such was Slmver.
He had by this time become my overseer,
for he had clung to me all through the years.
When Graham got his promotion, a year be-
fore, Shaver transferred his account to me.
The other men about the station saw that he
was sure to rise, but as he was still the same
quiet, steady, kindly fellow as ever, no one
begrudged him his advance. The Melbourne
owners wanted to “ring-in” a newchum for
me to break in, but I said : “No, you don’t,
if you please” ; and Ned was appointed. It
made little difference. He had long had
quarters in bachelors’ hall, as we call the
rooms of the single station officials —the
storekeeper, the overseer, the experienced
hands, and so on. He took his meals with
us; he was as much and as intimately one
of us as if he had been sent up from town
and had not “growed” among us from his
four-foot nothing to over six foot. Mr.
Saunders to the men: to me he was always
Shaver.
We sat at breakfast one hot morning in
December. Early as it was, the blaze upon
the empty plain before our room could hardly
be endured. “Shaver, old son,” I said.
“What’s up, boss?” he asked at once.
I tossed to him across the table an opened
letter which had arrived by the morning’s
mail.
It was a scrawl from old Jimmy Robert-
son, of Cootralantra. The old boy had been
stocking heavily for shearing, and he was
caught in a bit of a drought; in consequence
he wished to sell me some of his prime sheep
for next to nothing, so that they shouldn’t
die on the run. lie wrote now to place a
ten-thousand lot under offer at 3s. delivered
on Cootralantra. I had room for them;
and, besides, I thought it likely the weather
would break, when my- speculation must
greatly improve. This was the letter Shaver
was reading.
“That’s a cheap lot,” he commented.
“Dead cheap,” said I, “and I mean to take
it. But the bosses in Melbourne won’t stand
a draft for ten thousand : I should be over
my limit with six. So I’ll buy five thou, for
them, and the other half I’ll take on my
own hook. There’ll be a year’s wool at least,
maybe some lambs, and I’ll sell off shears.
With anything like luck, I reckon on
clearing a couple of hundreds. Now, you
ain’t busy, old man ; suppose you take deliv-
ery and bring the monkeys over here. I’ll
stand you £3O for the job, or go you third
share, if you like.”
Shaver spread the marmalade thick upon
his bread, finished his cup of coffee, and re-
plenished the cup before he replied. Just
his deliberate wav : I knew what the answer
would be: “Please yourself, boss ; I’m ready
to go anywhere you like.”
I considerd the risks for half a minute,
then I said: “£3O let it be, then. The
cheque’ll be more useful to you for etceteras
when you tie-up with the little girl on
Yougoway.”
She was the manager’s daughter, a grand
girl, reared on a station, pretty as a picture,
and just as good, jolly and kind and straight,
but plenty of pluck and temper—whenever
I saw her she made me think of what such a'
girl might have made out of me if we had
met 20 years ago. Ah, well! I liked her
with all my heart, but Shaver worshipped
her, and I think she appreciated it.
He gave _me a glance and said: “Not
bound to give me a cent. I’m the firm’s
property.”
“Firm be hanged ! Think I want to use
you up for nix; what sort of a ‘shyster’ do
you take me for? Not my style, sonny.”
“I know,” he said. “Just do as you think
best.”
“Then it’s settled,” I went on. “You can
cut your stick as soon as you like. Go over
by Yougoway, and you need be in no hurry.
Robertson’ll be too glad to see you at all to
make any bother about a day here or there.
But, I say, old man. Don’t you come back
through Yougoway. They’ve got none too
much feed or water there, and I’m thinking
Feltham’ll be losing some of his stock. You
bring your mob down the CootreHntra boun-
dary, cross the Luck’s All Creek, then you
can follow the road round here. It’s a bit
of a roundabout, but it’ll never do to mooch
on poor old Feltham just now.”
“It’s dashed kind of you to think of that,”
he said in his slow way.
So, a few days afterwards, I strolled
down one hot forenoon to the first paddock
gate with the dogs, and there we said good-
bye ; Shaver and I. He gave me from his
saddle a grip of his firm, warm hand, the
clear eyes looking straight into mine as he
answered my “Take care of yourself, Shaver,
old boy; so-long,” with his cheery: “You
bet, boss; good day and gpod luck.” Then
he thrust his pipe back in between his
teeth, gave me a nod, half saucy, half affec-
tionate, and turned down the track in a
canter. The little mare swung along, the
rider firm as a rock in the saddle; the thin,
white smoke borne backwards by the* motion.
At the futher rise he halted a moment and
threw up his arm, and I waved my hat.
Then he was gone.
Poor old Shaver! Poor little lass of You-
goway !
After a week a man of mine who had been
sent with a few more to wait for Shaver’s
coming to take the Cootralantra sheep, came
back to the station, and the story that he
told, here it is :
“We got th’ sheep f’om Mr. Robe’son, an’
made a start. ’Twas rainin’, not much,
though. We fetched them sheep down along
th’ ol’ bound’ry fence, nex’ day we wus onto
the crick. I don’ think Mr. Saunders ’e
knew that sort o’ country, so I ups an’ tol’
’im w’at I thought. He says, cool-like: ‘This
’ere’s a bit of a spec o’ Mr. Hurst’s, an’ I
ain’t noways a-goin’ to deliver ’is sheep all
knocked :to pieces.’ ‘Right!’ I says, an’ says
no more, barrin’ to the chaps. Well, it
rained that night, like Hell, I can tell you ;
I carn’t rec’lect ’arder. My oath, it did pour.
Mr. Saunders ’e didn’t like it, not a little bit.
I knew we wus in for fits as soon as the
-crick come down. ‘Bill.’ says ’e. ‘we’ll try
and get the sheep on a bit.’ ‘Lor’,’ I says, it’s
as dark as inside a tarbarrel; sheep won’t
move!’ ‘We’ll try,’ he said, and so try we
did. But sheep ’t any time’s awful fools.
We wus hours gettin’ ’em a bir furder,
an’ then we camps. ’Ad to. Mr. Saun-
ders ’e was sorry and angry, ’f y’u
kin un’erstan’. Not to say much, though.
’Twas too miser’ble. Rain, rain, rain, an’
mud ev’rywhere, an’ I’d a gev a big slice out
o’ me year’s screw f’r us all to be ’way any-
where out o’ that. ’Cause I knowed that
crick. It’s a man-trap, that’s what it is.
W’en I wus carryin’, I see that crick’s dry
’s a skelington be 6 o’clock o’ night, an’ we
wus stuck there next mornin’, an’ f’r three
days afore we could cross it. That was up ’igh ;
down where we wus wi’ th’ sheep it spread
out f’r miles, an’ what give me fits wus to
think we wus right in the track of it. I
couldn’t tell f’r certain, ’cause them cricks
they ’as no channels to speak about, they
goes an’ scoops one out wheniver a
flood comes down. I wus dozin’ ’r some-
thin’, an’ all at once Jim sings out: .‘Christ!
Billy, what’s that?’ ’Twas the crick. We
could ’ear it like a roar, but couldn’ see fur
the dark. Mr. Saunders, ’e jumps fur ’is
’orse, says he: ‘Are you—goin’ to let the
sheep go to blazes whilst y’u scratch y’ur
’ead?’ I said t’ ’m, ‘For God A’mighty’s
sake, don’ you go ’way f’om this ’ere camp !
It’s ’ow us men’s to get quit of ’ere that
we’ve got to think about.’ He turns on me
short, ‘You a cocktail, Billy?’ ‘No, that I
ain’t,’ says I, ‘l’ll go ’long with you.’ No
more said. Got me ’orse, an’ on I jumps. Mr.
Saunders, ’e shook ’ands wi’ me, an’ says.
‘lt’s Mr. Hurst’s spec, this is Billy, an’ if
I lose them sheep I’d as well lose me right
’an’.’ ‘Oh, I didn’ know,’ I said. We wus
splashin’ away to th’ sheep camp. All of a
sudden we went souse into deep water. Mr.
Saunders ’e sings out. ‘My God, where’s them
sheep?’ I wus be’in’ ’im an’ hollers, ‘Turn
back, man, this ’ere’s the crick!’ ’E didn’
take no notice, on’y says, ‘The sheep !’ We
wus tryin’ to get furder, an’ the curr’nt wus
sweepin’ us down. It all ’appened like a
heap, I couldn’ say how, but ’is ’orse come
down on to mine, an’ we wus both under.
Lor’, ’ow that water took me down. I felt
meself goin’ like fun. I reached out after
somethin’, don’ know what, couldn’ hold it,
an’ went furder. Then I got among scrub,
an’ pretty soon clutched for life, an’ ’eld on.
Findin’ it wus a biggish bush, I climbs up
an’ sits there shiverin’ all night. When
mornin’ come, lo an’ be’ol’, shallow water
wus on one side an’ the crick ’alf a mile
wide on the other. Well. I wades in an’
gets back to the camp. They wus in a nice
way, too! Jim ’e went back to Cootralan-
tra, an’ me an’ the boy we ’unts roun’ f’r
Mr. Saunders. We didn’ do anv good till
the crick goes down ; be that time Mr. Robe’-
son come down. We foun’ Mr. Saunders in
one o’ the ben’s, near knocked to bits with
the timber. Hawful. Sir, ’e wus a man, by
God !
“A man. by God !” That was his epitaph.
Boor old Shaver!
