“Socialism and Character,”
M.A.
by Henry Sturt
(George Allen & Unwin, Ltd.)
Theoretical socialism always pictures a
world in which there is no sin or vice,,
in which the wicked capitalist has been
abolished, and where everything proceeds
with a clock-like regularity. If the social-
istic world really were such, it might prove
a very pleasing change from the present
state of affairs. Unfortunately, practical
experience has demonstrated that theories
are only theories and differ widely from
realities. Still, for those who like to delude
themselves with the belief that Utopia can
exist, Professor Henry Sturt, of the uni-
versity of Wales, has written a most com-
forting volume. The perfect socialist State
will, in theory at least, organise our lives
down to the smallest detail. It will not
be enough to abolish the land system and
public debts, inheritance and capitalism,
and any rewards that special industrial
ability or inventive genius now earns, but
production and consumption will each be
regulated, in the interests of the community,
by co-operative societies and guilds. The
principle of high payment of Government
servants will be largely extended, though,
we are informed, less money will be spent
pU the pomp and circumstance of govern-
ment. c - c(
But true socialism, as Professor Sturt
preaches, will interfere as much in pri-
vate life as in public. Indeed, there will
be no private life at all. The dysgenic influ-
ence of individualism is to be destroyed,
and race propagation will be regulated by
Government order or prohibition, as the case
may require. The science of eugenics will
have full sway, and only the healthy and the
sane he licensed to marry. IIow; a lover shall
prove himself sane is not explained . Accord-
ing to the author, one effect of socialism will
be to raise the status of women, which would
be a very good thing. But experience, as in
Russia to-day, does not by any means con-
firm this view. The economic dependence
of woman on man is no doubt bad; but it
has not Quite such bad results as is suggested
here. As a matter of fact, the Professor
Shows/but a limited understanding of women.
The androcratic system, in which man
is dominant and woman subservient, is
androcratic only in name in modern coun-
tries. In Oriental countries it is much more
securely established, for the East still holds
to the Confueian saying: “As the sun is
above the earth so is man above woman.”
However, practical experience tends to show
that the influence of woman is actually
greatest in those countries where her public
position is most negligible. A Japanese
will speak of his “wretched wife,” or “silly
wife,” and deprecatingly present her to,
foreigners, but behind the slioji her influence
is supreme. It would be interesting but
fruitless to speculate on how the modern
history of China might have been developed,
but for the counter-intrigues of Yen-lo and
the Pearl Concubine. In India the purdah
is only a physical and not a mental or moral
barrier from the outside world. So acute
au observer as Mr. Uucy has expressed the
opinion that the women of the Victorian
age, secluded though they were, exercised a
greater influence than do the freer and more
masculine ladies of to-day. Professor Sturt
underestimates the influence of women in
the past, perhaps because women, though
naturally social reformers, are rarely social-
ists. He is certainly wrong in his estimate
of their failings. tie can have had very
little experience of women during the war to
deny them the virtue of bravery, lie also
refuses them honor and common honesty, and
oven the most favorable conditions of social-
ism will make them only “nearly as honest”
as men! He grants them coquetry and,
frippery and trickery, all due to the desire
to cajole men and catch husbands. But
have men never delighted in smart rai-
ment. or preened themselves before a mirror
for the ultimate delectation of women? To
sum up, this writer comes to the conclusion
that the kind of man a woman really likes is
the “tame cat.” How different from Miss
Ethel Dell’s conception of the hero, who
bites bis ladylove in the neck, drags her
round by the hair, and thrashes her with a
dogwhip! Evidently Guildford and Aberyst-
with do not see eye to eye.
It wiH be a surprise to learn that in the
true socialistic State the level of culture will
be much higher than under the individualistic
system. What are now called the cultured
classes will be less cultured, whilst the un-
cultured will be cultured, so that, whilst the
peak may not be as lofty, the general average
will be higher. Frankly this paper does not
brieve it, and, in view of the many social-
istic experiments in higher education, it is
rather remarkable that no example of the
tendency is quoted. Socialism will simplify
the lives of the workers and leave more time
for intellectual pursuits, but the argument
simply will not hold water. Professors
pmte about the higher standard of living,
but the facts are dead against them. Hours
have been reduced, wages have been raised,
but the pursuit of culture is trodden in the
mud as the crowds hasten to the races and
the football matches.
Socialism is. if carried to its logical con-
clusion, Prussianism in its worst form. It
means, as expressed by Professor Sturt, the
regimentation of mankind to the extinction
of individuality. It connotes the oblitera-
tion of the family as a unit, and the reduc-
tion of parenthood to a mechanical level, “by
order.” There is no reasonable certainty of
any of the promised benefits materialising,
but there is reasonable certainty of very
many of them miscarrying. Socialism no
more means social reform than eloquence
does truth.
The Inscrutable Jap
Japan’s Pacific Policy , by Iv. K. Kawa-
feapi CE. P. Dutton and Co., New York),
casts some interesting lights on the apparent
defeat of the Japanese delegates at the
Washington Conference. Apparent because
“monkeys do not fall among trees.” and the
Japanese diplomats are far too astute to be
really defeated in any conference of the sort.
The ready acquiescence of the Japanese dele-
gates in naval limitation, in the Pacibc
status, in the retrocession of Shantung, and
in the evacuation of Siberia, not less than
in the “Open Door Treaty," of . which the
world has heard far too little, created the
most favorable impression, and even the
cynic began to wonder whether, indeed, the
imperialists of the East might not' have suf-
fered a change of heart, realising that all
desire is but illusion and a new binding on
the wheel. A sense of sin is so often a
starting-point of progress that there has
been quite a movement to re-estimate Japan’s
policies, based upon the apparently reformed
character which appeared at Washington.
But diplomatic conferences are not unlike
crochet.- only a small part in the making can
be seen at one time. The final intricate
pattern can only be completely revealed
when the work is finished. So far, all the
estimates of the work of the Conference have
been nrovided by those who took an active
part in its working, and, as might be ex-
pected from the inherent defects of human
nature, those estimates have been of an
extraordinarily self-congratulatory character.
As the Washington Conference is the only
one in history where all parties got what
they wanted, or at least said that they got
it, this is not strange; but it may be recalled
that Talleyrand, who had great experience in
conferences, wrote that the “treaty- which
satisfies everybody satisfies nobody”—a very
true and wise saying.
K. K. Kawakami’s volume is a Japanese
record of the proceedings of the Conference.
It is written by one who has long been known
as a distinguished member of the Japanese
press organisation which moulds public
opinion in the eastern States of America in
consonance with the views of Tokyo. What
he writes may be regarded, therefore, as
official; and that which is official is of im-
portance, not for what is said, but for that
which is left unsaid. The chapters consist
of letters from Washington to New York and
Baltimore papers during the period of the
Conference, and one only needs to compare the
dates and contents of the letters with the
diary of the Conference to realise how inti-
mately the writer was associated with the
Japanese delegation, and to what extent his
letters were of the nature of official propa-
ganda.
The results claimed for the Conference are
a limitation of armaments, a 10-year peace
in the Pacific, and the settlement of China.
Actually, not one of these results has been
attained. The competition in naval arma-
ments has merely been transferred from one
branch to another, from battle units to sub-
marines. The 10-year Pacific Peace Treaty
merely binds the four Powers concerned to
respect each other’s insular rights in the
Pacific so long as peace prevails, whilst the
U.S.A. has only approved the treaty subject
to the endorsement that America is not
thereby “committed to armed force, alliance,
or obligation to join in any defence” ! By
the naval and Pacific treaties America to
all intents and purposes abandons all in-
terest in the Western Pacific. With a
baseless fleet the U.S. flag flies over the
Philippines only by permission of Japan,
which country Ivawakami notes is “Mistress
of the Pacific.”
But China and her so-called settlement is
the real kernel of the Conference, which \yill
figure in history principally by what it nas
achieved for that wretched country. From
the days of Yosbida Shoin and the prc-Meiji
revolutionaries the policy of Japan has been
to control China and the Pacific. That is
still the axis of her policy. Previous to the
Washington Conference the keystone was the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance, flanked by subsidi-
ary agreements : the Franco-Japanese Agree-
ment of 1907; the Russo-Japanese Agree-
ments of 1908-1912; and the Root-Tqkuhira
Agreement of 1908. The declared policy of
all these understandings was the territorial
integrity of China, and the “open door.” How
they worked out in practice is now ancient
history. Suffice it to say that by 1921 Japan
had absorbed all the Russian and German
rights, and claimed as her sphere of influence
Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, Fukien, Amoy
and a large portion of the much-prized
British sphere in the Yangtse. What has
the Washington Conference done to ameli-
orate this condition? It has agreed to scrap
all spheres of influence,'except those in which
Japan has special rights; to pool all conces-
sions except the most important Japanese
ones, for she pools only those for which she
would have to find real money to exploit;
and by the “Open Door Treaty” the Powers
have guaranteed yet again the “sovereignty
and integrity, territorial and administrative,
of China.” True, China can have Shan-
tung back —if she pays for it, which, as she
is absolutely bankrupt, does not mean a
lot
Any claim on the part of the Conference
to have settled China is futile. When one of
China’s baker’s dozen of “saviours” gets the
upper hand and begins to settle the country
from within, a conference may help very
much; and on the lines laid down at Wash-
ington. But so long as the Premier of to-
day is the refugee of to-morrow nothing use-
ful can be achieved. K. K. Kawakami gives
a well-informed, if biased, account of some
of China’s worst troubles, and his deductions
are shrewd and correct.
Of course Washington was the scene of
the final obsequies of the Anglo-Japanese
Alliance. In its place has arisen an entente,
the leadership of which, as is repeatedly in-
sisted in this book, belongs to America. For
Japan, certainly, there can be .no comparison
of benefits. At the end she may not have
had a great love for the Alliance, but she
had a great respect for the benefits which
it had conferred. It will be interesting to
see how the entente will work, but Mr.
Kawakami hardly conceals his belief that
American leadership foredooms it to failure,
nor is there much doubt that therein lies
a principal reason for Japan’s ready accept-
ance of the new arrangement. All of which
goes to show that the humility of the
Japanese delegation at Washington was
more apparent than real. In effect, Barons
Kato and Shidehara played the old judo
trick of suddenly slacking the muscles a.nd
letting their opponents fall over themselves.

PINKETTES
FOR SICK HEADACHE
Most people suffer at regular
intervals from sick-headache. The
trouble is caused by accumulation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coaled ovals that act
so gently that they are the ideal
laxative to use in correcting a
tendency to sick headache. They
have no unpleasant effect to make
them objectionable to the extra-
sensitive sick-headache patient.
Old-fashioned harsh purgatives
will not do at all in such cases.

Within a casket fair.

As delicate as air.

And many a pearl most pure
Laugh up from it as bright as wine,
As apple-bloom demure.

About the lovely gift
That Love, for sweet remembering,

Blow wind of heaven, buffeting, cleansing

Turn me from quest of the uttermost,
starriest height.
Blow, wind; oh, blow ! Be your strength as
the strength of a giant
Yet face I you; nor all your strength
wielded and thrown
At my body shall batter it back; for ever
d'fiant
I make the ascent, till I stand on the
stimmit alone.

Cowardice.
It was the heavy lisping twilight time
Of grey moth-rhyme;
The muted world went by on steps of wool,
The airs were cool,
Far cow-bells jangled peace and a star-
gleam
Lit the low stream.
The world slipped softly from me hill by hill.
Time seemed to spill
In some black nothingness beyond the ken
Of lamps and men;
And as the utter darkness round me grew
Its voice I knew.
It breathed a language older than the high
Wind-calling sky,
More magical than whispers of lost leaves
When autumn grieves
Down the sad morning and the woods are
still,
Waiting her will.
And I, who knew the tongue, paused not to
hear,
Faint with the fear
Of some clear knowledge exquisite with
pain
Of life made vain—
Ah, vainer than the moth-light in the gloom
Of a grey room !
Poor coward heart! Had I but stayed to
know
That word, night slow,
Perhaps all fear had died upon a breath
Older than death
And found a sudden rainbow making rhyme
Of light and time!

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Modern Song of Peace.
I fain would weave a soulful lay of lines
inspired by early Spring,
M hen wattle blooms beside the way and
feathered friends are carolling:
For peace is found in my abode and banished
are the. leaden rains
That smote the squadrons as they strode
across the battle-wasted plains.
And rather than a martial song with many
a stave of action grim,
I fain would watch the magpies throng and
hear a magic forest hymn.
Those days are dead when passion sped the
songster’s heart, the poet’s pen.
To stir to fire the dreaming youth and thrill
the wakened hearts of men.
Shell-shattered in the ruck of war, his free-
dom scanty recompense.
His hot youth spent on fields afar, he loiters
where the crowds are dense.
On paven ways, in streets ablaze, in marts
with many colors shot
The broken Digger stays awhile to dumbly
nurse his lonely lot.
Ah, not for him the show of pride, the
glamor and the costly bays,
Alas ! Yet who would dare deride the promise
of his fiditing days’?
The drum that timed a victor’s march and
stirred the thunder tramp of feet.
The banner and the triumph arch are ban-
ished from the crazy street.
So I would lilt a lay of peace like magic
stanzas I have beard
About the smiling Spring’s increase, the
wattle, and the singing bird ;
But martial notes intrude the while and
move me with their strange discord....
Ah, once I caught a glance of guile half
h’dden by a naked sword!

ALL EYES ARE ON UNCLE.
Lloyd George is said to be writing a book.
If he is honest with himself and his con-
temporaries, and extenuates nothiug, it
ought to contain a great chapter on the
imbecilities of politicians. Not four years
ago he himself carried the British consti-
tuencies on a programme of “hanging the
Kaiser” and “making Germany pay the cost
of the war to the last penny.” Seven
months afterwards, returning to the House
of Commons from his triumphs at Versailles,
he “announced, amid loud cheers, that an
inter-Allied tribunal, would sit in London
for the trial of the ex-Kaiser.” Referring
to the Peace Treaty, he stated that Ger-
many, bv signing it, had admitted her obli-
gations for all the costs of the war —“some
30,000 millions sterling.” To discharge this
debt she would have to find 1800 millions a
year. He challenged anyone to point to a
single clause of the Treaty which was not
in accordance with the sternest and highest
demands of justice and fair play. Part of
that was said on July 3, 1919; the rest on
July 19. Last week the man who said it
implored the French not to send a bailiff
into the Ruhr Valley, Germany having de-
faulted, not once but many times. His
Government has expressed its willingness,
conditionally upon the cancellation of the
Allied loans raised in the U.S.A., to
“remit all debts due to Britain by the Allies
in respect of loans, and by Germany in
respect of reparations.” And the untried
and impenitent Hohenzollebns are still
sawing wood or chasing flappers for recrea-
tion and .exercise in Holland. - • •
At the Spa Conference in July. 1920. the
British share of the indemnity was fixed at
22 per cent. In the London agreement of
May, 1921, Germany’s total liability, includ-
ing- sums already paid and the Belgian debt
to the Allies, tor which she had assumed
responsibility, was declared to amount to
132,000 million gold marks. The German
Government, which had unavailingly offered
to pay 30,000 million gold marks, over and
above 20,000 million alleged to have been
surrendered in the form of property, accepted
these terms. The Reichstag adopted them
by a good majority. One of the provisions
of the agreement was that 12,000 million
gold marks should be delivered by July 1,
1921, and a further 38,000 million was due
on November 1. But by December 31 the
Reparations Commission had received only
1011 million gold marks, including the
amounts paid in before the agreement be-
came operative. The 1922 contribution was
to have been 2000 million gold marks, plus
an amount equal to 26 per cent, of the
German exports. Only a pathetic fraction
of it has arrived. Fritz now declares that
he has temporarily exhausted his capacity
to pay. He pleads for a moratorium till
1921. The French, who should know their
Hun better than the British or the Yanks,
having been his neighbor for centuries, re-
fuse to believe him. Their view is that he
is scheming to get out of his obligations, and
propose to make liim fulfil them by force.
The Belgians, who have also had a long
and intimate experience of the Boche, are
of the same opinion, and will stand by
France. Lloyd George, on the other hand,
in one of those striking reversals of form
by which his career has been distinguished,
has become a defender of the .nation
whose hereditary monarch he wanted to
hang. He believes, or professes to believe,
that for the time being, economically con-
sidered, it is down and out. On the word
of a lawyer who was Minister of Munitions
for a year or so, he assures France that she
has no need to arm against a war of re-
venge, since Germany, as a military Power,
is "broken and in the dust.” To whjch the
French reply, politely but pertinently, that
they are guided in military niatters by
Foch, and that, lacking the guarantees pro-
mised by Britain and America at Versailles,
an army —necessarily large and, therefore,
costly—is their only protection against the
unforgiving Boche and the unwhipped
Bolsh. The Prime Minister is on firmer
ground when he reminds the French of
Britain’s devastated trade. At the end of
last month there were 1,350,000 unemployed
in the U.K. They and their dependants, to
the number altogether of about five millions,
are being supported out of taxation. They
can’t get work because war-w’asted Europe
is too poor to buy the goods they used to
produce. Rightly or wrongly, the Grovern-
rnent has come to the conclusion that the
only way of restoring the situation is to
let the foreign war loans and the British
share of the reparations go. Excluding
Russia, whose borrowings (G5O millions*
are irrecoverable, the Allies owe Britain
1300 millions. At 22 per cent, of the in-
demnity the German liabilities are 1450 mil-
lions. America holds 860 millions of British
war stock, but there is three years’ interest
to be added. The British offer to abandon
all hope of repayment if the U.S.A. shows
a like generosity is “subject to the jn**-
Claims of other of the Empire.” All
the same, it will decidedly prevent W. M.
Hughes from asserting at the next election,
as he did at the last, that the money for
cashing the Digger’s gratuity bond will be
dragged from Berlin.
* * * •
In a sense, the U.S. Government brought
about the latest crisis in the affairs of dis-
tracted Europe by requesting Britain to pay
the current year’s interest on the 860
millions, and repay the principal, plus
funded interest, within a quarter of a cen-
tury. Britain thereupon notified the Allies
that, while willing to cancel their debts, as
part of a general plan, she would have to
ask them to meet their engagements to the
extent that the U.S. compelled her to meet
hers. France accordingly decided to apply
pressure to Germany. In the situation to
which she has been reduced by her ghastly
war losses and the failure of her late enemy
to comply with the provisions of the Treaty
(according to Poincare, France has spent
80 milliards of francs on reparations which
the Prussian should have paid), she has no
alternative, failing help from her Allies. Un-
like Britain she has been unable to mobilise
foreign Securities to ease her financial posi-
tion. Before the war, about 50 per cent, of
her foreign investments were made in Rus-
sia, Austria and Turkey. During the war,
she lent nearly 200 millions to Russia.
Practically all these holdings are worthless.
Bankrupt Turkey and dismembered Austria
can’t pay, and Red Russia won’t. If it is
found impossible to wring adequate repara-
tions from Germany, only the U.S.A. will
stand between France and a financial col-
lapse, for Britain has her hands full. Of
course, 860 millions is only part of the sac-
rifice that the Americans are asked to make.
France owes them nearly 600 millions,
Italy 320 and Belgium about 70. As a
matter of fact, they lent their Allies more
than Britain did. In “International Finance
and Its Reorganisation.” a monumental
work by an American writer, Elisha M.
Friedman, the inter-Allied loans issued by
the U.S.A. are shown to amount to 9466
million dollars; by the British to 9251 mil-
lion dollars. If the Yankees can be brought
to believe that it will profit them to make a
bonfire of Europe’s p.n.’s for the 9466 million
dollars, the thing will be done. But they will
take a lot of persuading. When the matter w r as
broached at Versailles, President Wilson
and his advisers were uncompromisingly hos-
tile. The terms imposed on Germany were
made stiffer for that reason. A year later,
in answer to a proposal from London, the
Washington Government wrote that it was
“not prepared to consent to the remission
of any part of the debt of Britain to the
U. 5.,” and suggested that the funding
arrangements should be hurried on to avoid
the nossibility of “a dangerous misunder-
standing.” Now it is asking for its interest.
In short, the official U.S. attitude is unpro-
mising. Still, there are enlightened Ameri-
cans who have taken up the cause of Europe
with generous enthusiasm. They understand
their countrymen, and it is auite possible
that they will end by convincing them that
without a general cancellation of debts due
from one Ally to another, leaving Germany
bound to repair the wrongs done to the coun-
tries she invaded and desolated, the war-
wasted wor*d cannot be made safe for
democracy. There is a hard side to Samuel’s
character, but he is not without imagination
and has shown himself capable of magna-
nimity in emotional moments.
INDUSTRIALISM AND THE R. S.
LEAGUE.
At the recent; Returned Soldiers and Sailors’
Conference the familiar complaint was made
that the petty tyrants of unionism have
somehow acquired, and exercise, the “right”
to shut capable workmen out of their unions
(while admitting incapables on their politi-
cal records), and then demand that they be
refused employment for being out. This sug-
gests tile out Caivinistic doctrine of pre-
destination, as preached when the faith was
in its leruCiOus prune, a dogma by which
the vast majority of the human race was
born lost, and had to remain lost whatever
its merits, and finished an unsatisfactory
career by. being damned for being lost. In
addition to the capable men (mostly impor-
tations or the products of vocational train-
ing) who are excluded, and the vast number
of boys who grow up without being capable
of anything definite, thanks to the limita-
tions put on apprenticeship, quite stupen-
dous efforts are being made to create a record
army of unemployed. In Westralia, one
of the soldier-speakers reported, the house
famine, caused by sheer lack of bricklayers,
has reached alarming proportions, to the
Serious increase in the cost of living and the
serious decrease of settlers, the average set-
tler being unfitted for nesting in trees.
An exorbitant proportion of the exist-
ing toilers in this line are not only-
poor tradesmen, but have reached or passed
the 50-year mark, and are fast approaching
the time when they will bricklay no longer.
No effort has been made to replace them,
still less to provide adequately for the needs
of a population that has a habit of doubling
every now and then. So bricklayers almost
threaten to become a dying race like the
aborigines, or a dead one like the Waterloo
veterans, who are now supposed to be ex-
tinct. Some striking results arise out of
these strange doings. For instance
Whereas during the ten years to June, 1911, an
average of £6,400,000 per annum loan money was
spent by the States in order that that more or less
chronic class, the unemployed or odd-job brigade,
might be kept fairly well supplied with the rough
kind of work which it is fit for;
In the year to June, 1921, the amount spent was
over £41,000,000. Yet the cry of the surplus odd-
jobber was louder in the land than ever before, so
much had he multiplied. And so much had the
skilled worker diminished or slowed down that the
house-famine came to stay, and the habit of nesting
in trees came to be seriously considered.
During the ten years to June, 1911, the interest
bill of the six States increased by £2,078,657. in
the one lonesome year to June, 1921, it increased by
£2,419,061.
In 1901 Australia bought £42,400,000 worth of
goods because it didn’t supply its own requirements,
in 1921 it imported £163,800,000 for the same
reason.
* * *
There is no cause to imagine that the
heated mentioning of these and similar
scandals, at public meetings or elsewhere, to
the parties mainly responsible, will have
any effect on the situation. It is one of this
country’s self-presented testimonials that the
Australian workman is far too level on the
top of the cranium to be led away by wild
Communist theories. Yet the fact remains
that, at one Labor conference after another,
the Communists, alleged to be a negligible
minority, achieve remarkable success at
running the show. It is a fairly safe policy,
to judge by appearances, so long as they are
bad appearances, and so leave a margin for
contingencies. The Communist leaders be-
lieve in the repudiation of public debts, and
they naturally believe in having as large a
public debt as possible so that there may be
the more profit in repudiation. They also
naturally like the debt to be burdensome to
the last degree, because misery makes pro-
selytes. Highly respectable and orthodox
Eeople have been converted to cannibalism
y sufficient financial and other pressure,
and to convert a citizen to filing his own or
the public schedule should be much efisier
than that. The same leaders believe in
revolution, and poverty and misery help to
make revolutionists. And, on the same prin-
ciple, apparently, they believe in ignorance,
especially ignorance of any high-class trade.
This is one reason why the I.W.W. organisa-
tion, which seeks to be a chronic revolution
or insurrection on a small scale, contains 10
bottle-dealers for one certificated engineer—
and any big gaol can show a hundred
laborers for one electrical expert, compositor
or carpet-weaver.
Those who, like the soldiers, desire to
save a promising nation from sinking into
coolieism and Communism, require to have
a definite programme and to aim high. So
far.'among Nationalists and such-like, the
definiteness has been very little in evidence.
Some of the reformers’ purposes might be
these:—
To dissociate themselves from the borrowing craze
to the utmost of their ability, and not play the game
of the advocates of revolution, chaos and Communism
by being only a shade less active than themselves in
the work of making ultimate repudiation practically
certain. In other words, they should cease to under-
mine any shreds of manliness that the habit of chalk-
ing up almost everything against the baby has left
to the Australian, even for the sake of the senile
grandiosity of putting a million bankrupt farmers on
a million dry and remote farms.
To establish the piecework system- instead of day-
labor and class-consciousness in every industry where
it can be applied. It not only leads to far larger
output, but it helps the supefior employee to
move into the employer class, and constant
motion of this sort tends, in the old United
States phrase, towards “bridging the blar.ky
gulf.” This would naturally arouse the fury of revo-
lutionary union bosses, who desire that classes, instead
of tending to disappear, should become so unutterably
fixed that the “wage-slave” shall see no alternative
to “wage-slavery” except the capsize of civilisation
amid gore and flames and entrails.
To get a perfectly new sort of unionism, under
which every union shall be open (like law and medi-
cine) to every person who proves by examination that
he is an expert craftsman,-and to no others; also io
make the teaching of trades 'compulsory, and to
penalise nothing in the industrial world save loafing,
parasitism and ignorance.
It would bp a long road to the complete

THE NEGLECTED THINGS.
Bill Smith is the heir to the culture o£ the
ages and the possessor of an educated intel-
ligence : he is also a complete fool. Can both
these statements be true? They can—be-
cause they are. William is the typical citi-
zen of a modern State. He is, although he
usually does not know it, a disciple of Fran-
cis bacon. Bacon suggested tnat if pointed
questions were put to a a cure tile iauy would
cleaver up her secrets ior tne use and benent
of mankind. Various questions have been
put; .Nature has been forced to give too right
answers; the Knowledge thus gained has been
used in making lite more comiortahle on the
material smc; and all this, in the lust ana-
lysis, is tue worn or Smith. lie has pro-
duced the steam-engine, the weavmg-loom,
tne telephone and elaborate plumbing, th
has produced a well-warmed and well-lighted
world, filled with good food, sanitary and
convenient dwellings, and ail sorts of facili-
ties for swift and safe travel. How has
Smith brought ail these wonders to pass?
Very simply! He has paid a huge army of
creative thinkers to gam a knowledge of
Nature's secrets, and to apply that know-
ledge to increase his comfort. To this extent
he has acted the part of a wise man. It is
only necessary', however, to examine the facts
of- his communal life to see the extent to
which he is a Tory-minded fool. He lives iu
a community which is at once intimate in
quality and wide in extent. He is therefore
in constant relationship with a large num-
ber of folk like himself. His relations to
these folk are governed by a code of moral
rules which has been extant in one form or
another, but without changing in substance,
for some 11000 years. Take, as a typical
example, the code compiled by Hoses. These
rules, in so far as they affect the relations
of man to man, number six. It is enjoined
that parents be honored by their children —a
doctrine enjoined originally, of course, for
the preservation of the patriarchal ■system on
which the first rudimentary societies were
based. In China one can see reverence for
this principle run mad. Theft, homicide and
adultery are forbidden —and with much prac-
tical wisdom, since they give rise to reprisals
with a resultant disturbance of that soli-
darity which is so necessary to the preserva-
tion of the tribe. These laws, then, are obvi-
ously dictated by the most elementary 'con-
siderations of prudence. A somewhat deeper
psychological insight is shown in the com-
mands against false witness and the coveting
of another’s chattels; but the small measure
of foresight these display is still utilitarian
in inspiration, and could well have been the
work of a very ordinary intelligence. Yet
these laws, with some slight accretions o,
detail suggested in the course of their practi-
cal application during 3000 years, still pre-
vail. V\ hy has there been no advance, no
discovery of deeper knowledge of human
nature resulting in the codification of new
principles of conduct? Some, perhaps, will
say that the Mosaic code has the spiritual
value of a divine revelation, and therefore
represents all that man needs to know
of his moral nature. But this argu-
ment does not march, since the civilised world
pays lip-service to the divinity of a cataclys-
mic revolutionary in morals who taught
neighborly love, pacifism, communism—prin-
ciples which the world has almost unani-
mously neglected. Bill Smith obviously re-
gards the moralities as and he is
as obviously a fool for doing so. They should
be considered no less important as subjects
for study and investigation than sanitation
—an art which has advanced prodigiously
as a result of research even within the last
20 years—and the world would be a much
pleasanter place to live in to-day if they had
been so considered in the past.
If, in the matter of morals, Bill Smith
has proved himself a short-sighted ass, then,
when his political theories and practices are
examined, he stands but as a veritable im-
becile. These theories have been mostly in-
herited from Aristotle, a scholar who, more
than 2000 years ago, was considered by his
contemporaries to be a compendious but not
a particularly original thinker; the prac-
tices are uninspired attempts to adapt the
Aristotelian theories to modern conditions
Aristotle’s doctrines as to the composition
of matter and the nature of force have long
since been discarded, and it is worth asking
why his political ideas should be considered
any more authoritative. The State be en-
visaged could be crossed on foot in a days
travel. Its metropolis we should consider a
fair-sized country town. In Athens 500 citi-
zens were chosen —by lot —to form a council.
Since this number proved unwieldy, it was
divided in boards of 50- —each board holding
office for five weeks. These boards prepared
business for the deliberative assembly,
which consisted of the whole of the adult
citizens and which met four times a month.
Thus every piece of legislation, every execu-
tive act, was decided by the actual yea or
nay of the whole people in council assembled
—a wholly admirable arrangement for a
small community. Cricket clubs follow' it to
this day. But there are many practical
difficulties in the way of applying such a
constitution to a modern State. r rest
machinery has, therefore, been evolved with
a view to preserving the democratic
character of the Aristotelian constitution.
Electorates have been fixed —many of them
far bigger than a Greek State. Their re-
presentatives have twm functions —to pro-
tect the sectional interests of the electors
and to initiate and impose legislation. In
Australia they hold office for three years.
Our representatives do not propose legisla-
tion for the final sanction of the people.
In their relations with the people they deal
only in promises and fails accompli*.
Aristotle would himself repudiate the un-
democratic character of this arrangement,
and he would rightly conclude that govern-
ment in a huge modern State cannot be
conducted on the theories which suited up-
time and country. Smith may dimly realise
this truth. If the matter directly affectec
his food or his tobacco he would arrange
that the unsatisfactory conditions be exam-
ined hy experts and a practical solution
arrived at. As it does not—o-r. rather, as
he is too much of a fool to see. that it does
—he is content to hand the intricate pro-
blems of modern government to the first


adventurer who asks him for the authority
to mishandle them.
The other great department of Bill s
communal life—his economic relations with
his fellows—presents an equally chaotic
appearance. Adam Smith wrote acutely
about the value of competition as a method
of ensuring a fair distribution of the world s
wealth. Ilis unthinking descendant Bill
believes that competition is .still the only
method by which the production and distri-
bution of wealth.can be arranged. Yet com-
petition as a principle of commerce is fast
being superseded. Unions-fix the wages tor
an industry, thus eliminating competition be-
tweeu individual workers. 1 rusts create
monopolies in certain commodities, for which
the price charged is, theretore, not a com-
petitive price; “gentlemens agreements’ be-
t\veen looser federations of produceis have
the same result Co-operative societies of
consumers also do away with the element
of competition. Industry, to-day, is fast be-
coming a private struggle between organ-
these l two"
of the services he buys, and in the price
he pays for them—suffers, curses and does
nothing. If he were not a fool he would see
to it that at least as much creative thought
was addressed to this problem as is given to
the invention of a vacuum-cleaner. But he
doesn’t So it appears that in matters of
morals, politics and economics. Bill Smith
is a fool. Yet these represent the true quali-
ties of that life which differentiates man
from brute. Lacking the coherent force of
sane principles of community, our obese
civilisation will one day disintegrate and
perish. But Bill Smith is indifferent on
the subject—being too much of a fool to
understand.
J. W. CORNFORTH.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Pooled” Farmer.
Some belated information from London: —
Replying to a question in the House of Commons,
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade
said that from 1916-17 to 1919-20 the British Gov-
ernment bought 6,000,000 tons of Australian wheat.
The price worked out at ss. 2d. a bushel f.o.b.
Australia. The wheat bought elsewhere during the
same period averaged 9s. 3d. a bushel f.o.b. at the
country of origin.
It is pleasant reading for the farmers whose
war wheat was pooled. Another cheering
circumstance is that the British contracts
were made on their behalf partly by
Hughes himself and partly by a London
committee consisting or tne High Commis-
sioner (Fisher) and six superfluous Agents-
General. The Australian politician is usu-
ally like that in his ventures upon the tur-
bulent sea of trade. He can mostly be relied
upon to buy in the dearest market and sell
in the cheapest. When it was necessary to
import sugar he waited until the f.o.b. price
of the raw foreign article soared from £l5
to £55 a ton. Then he rushed into the Java
market and bought with his head down.
When he had wheat for sale he made a
hash of his shipping arrangements (Fuller,
the N. S. WaL-s Premier, said not long ago
that £10,000,000 was lost in this way), and
then, getting panic-stricken, let J. Bull
have the grain at his own price. In one
case the Old Man got 3,000,000 tons for
4s. 9d. a bushel f.o.b. For another parcel
of 1,500,000 tons he paid ss. 6d. a bushel.
Nobody can blame the British negotiators
for having done a good stroke of business
foP their country. But it is a serious matter
for the Australian farmer that his wheat
should have been quitted for 4s. Id. a bushel
less than the average price realised in
Canada, India and Argentina. That was
the root-cause of the slump in production
from 179.000,000 bushels in 1915-16 to
152,000.000 in 1916-17, 114.000,000 in 1917-
18, and 75,000,000 in 1918-19; and of the
down-and-out condition of most N. S. Wales
grain-growers when the drought withered
their 1919-20 crop. Probably the owners of
the wheat would have been willing to sell
it for ss. 2d. a bushel at siding. But
owing to the staggering cost of the pooling
system and the enormous losses from vari-
ous causes, shady and otherwise, they haven’t
received that net return or anything like
it. For their 1915-16 wheat they averaged
a fraction less than 4s. 9d. a bushel. For
the 1916-17 stuff the N. S. Wales and S.
Aus. cockies have drawn 3s. 3d. —less than
the cost of putting it in and taking it off—
and those in the other wheat-producing
States have fared little better. Only in
1920 did the price soar above 7s. 6d. And
then, by the irony of events, N. S. Wales had
no wheat to dispose of; and Victoria had
very little. Although seven years have
elapsed since the Commonwealth Govern-
ment burst into the grain business not one
of these pools has been wound up. At inter-
vals it is announced that the winding-up pro-
cess is imminent, but, owing to the situa-
tion in Roumania or the muddled state of
the accounts at the British end—any excuse
serves—it is always postponed indefinitely.
Meantime, the cost of administration goes
on. and the prospect of drawing a dividend
sufficient even to pay arrears of income-tax
or of interest on bank overdrafts becomes
fainter every week. Those who put wheat
into the second N. S. Wales pool were
awarded £549,000 as compensation for the
destruction of large quantities of their pro-
duce while the Government of the day had
charge of it; and have been waiting two
years for payment. Chaffey, Minister of
Agriculture, stated last week that in-
asmuch as the holders of 1916-17
scrip had been overpaid—a discovery
reported to have been made by a pri-
vate investigator, who found the pool
accounts in “a deplorable condition” —the
£549,000 wouldn’t be forthcoming. This
intimation nearly cost the Fullers their
jobs. The attitude of the Progressives,
hitherto friendly to the crowd in office, im-
mediately became menacing, and to save itself
from a motion for adjournment which must
have been successful, the Government climbed
down. It hastily announced that it had been
misunderstood, and that “every farmer with
wheat in the 1916-17 pool will receive the
full amount of compensation to which he
is entitled” —when all the pools are finalised.
The Lord knows when that will be. There
is only one thing certain about the dreary
and calamitous business, and that is its
uncertainty. The compulsory pooling of
wheat, under Government control, is Aus-
tralia’s worst contribution to the unwisdom
of the ages.
Politicians, Statesmen and Sundries.
Oxe way by which a statesman sometimes
keeps in office is by doing, or attempting, big
things for the nation in general, including
the unborn section oi’ it. In other words, he
appeals to the jury on the merits of his case.
Another way by which a politician often
keeps in office a great deal longer than anv
statesman is by buying sufficient members of
the jury, separately—sometimes with real,
but oftener with bogus money—then adopt-
ing the attitude that the merits of the case
can go to Blithering Blazes or elsewhere.
Merits, in such a matter, are rather an en-
cumbrance than otherwise, as the owner is
expected to live up to them. Demerits only
require to be lived down to. In recent Aus-
tralian times the Irish Sinn Fein vote did
a great deal to put the Dooley Ministry in
office. The spoils were paid for in pure
guff, for the Ministry could do nothing for
Sinn Fein, and it attempted nothing. The
Orange crowd did a tremendous lot to put
Dooley’s opponents on the Government
benches, and again the thing was a swindle.
Fuller has not injured liome: he never
can, and he knows he never can. Like
the Dooleys, the Pullers are where they
are on false pretences. A useful device in
Federal politics, which is run conjointly with
L.0.L.-ism by the long-lived Hughes Cabinet,
is that of purchasing State support by offering
to do purely State jobs with Federal money
(loan money). Thus Queensland support
may be bid for with aid for its sugar in-
dustry, and with the promise, or half-promise,
of a railway from South to North to link
together its bankrupt State lines—all this
partly at the charge of N.S.W. and Westralia.
N.S.W. can be offered the tail end of the
same line to make a connection with Bourke
and Sydney; possibly a Federal railway in
its territory to join Sydney with the Westra-
lian trans-oontinental job, and a railway
bridge over the Clarence, which doesn’t
pretend to bo other than a purely
local undertaking—all this partly at the
charge of Queensland and Westralia. West-
ralia is promised £2,000,000 for its immigra-
tion scheme —partly at the cost of Queensland
and N.S.W. Certainly there are losers in
the game, for nobody ever invented a crooked
game at which it could be even pretended that
everybody won. Victoria, owing to its ex-
ceedingly small area, is losing members, and
counts for less and less as a means of keep-
ing a Ministry in office. Tasmania and South
Australia, by reason of their still smaller
dimensions (the area of South Australia
blessed with even a 15-inch rainfall is barely
a tenth of the size of N.S.W.), are never
likely to have more than the handful of votes
they possess now, so they don’t count for
much in the office-hunting game. The
Northern Territory, which, being Federal
property, should be a first Federal considera-
tion, having no votes to sell, counts for
nothing at all. Nor does Papua for the
same reason. Nor does Posterity for the
same old identical reason. It is a miserable
and sordid game, but if well played it is a
paying one, and as a result politicians hold
office much longer on the average than states-
men. And a fair guess may be made as to
the nearness or otherwise of an election by
the vigor with which the game is played.

Our Red Tape Worms.
“El Verdugo” produces another specimen :
Its name is “Order to Pay Collector.’’ Privately,
and as the representative of a company whose head
office is outside N. S. Wales, I regularly have money
owed to me or my concern by various people. From
a collection point of view they resolve themselves
into three classes. In the first or blue-ribbon section
are those who do not wait for an account before send-
ing their cheque. Next in point of merit are various
unimaginative houses of commerce; to them I send
a regular monthly statement and they in return send
me their crossed cheques through the post to the
address on the account. A bad last is the Govern-
ment. On frequent occasions it owes my firm money
-—sometimes as much as seven or ten shillings in one
lump, Sometimes considerably more. It does not send
us a cheque, though, when the amount becomes due.
It sends an “Order to Collect.” I have one of those
documents before me now—for several shillings. It
is on bright blue paper, and after opening fire cere-
moniously, “Please pay on our behalf to Blank, whose
signature is given in the margin hereof,” and pro-
viding an elaborate series of dotted lines for a com-
plicated system of signatures, it winds up with these
useful notes: —
1. This document should be witnessed by any
Magistrate, Clergyman, Clerk of Petty Sessions, Crown
Lands Agent, legally-qualified Medical Practitioner,
Barrister, Solicitor, Superintendent, Inspector or
Sergeant of Police, Bank Manager, Postmaster or
Railway-Station Master.
2. Any such person, however, should be a disin-
terested party.
3. The witness should be satisfied as to the identity
of the person signing.
4. Any alteration should be initialled by the Prin-
cipal and by the Witness.
5. This document, if signed by the representative
of the payee, should be supported by production, at
the Department concerned, of the Instrument duly
stamped in N. S. Wales, if liable to stamp duty, em-
powering such representative to so sign.
6. This order must be signed by the Principal only,
or in- the case of Limited Companies by Managing
Director, or in his absence two other Directors. (The
underlines are the Department’s.)
Now the company which I represent registered origin-
ally in another State, and here I am its principal
and registered public officer. Its cheques bear my
signature alone. I have power to spend its funds up
to a limit, along ordinary business lines, without
consulting the directorate. But to secure a formal
authorisation for my office-boy to pick up a seven-
shilling crossed cheque from the Government office I
must, according to rule, send the authorisation on to
the head office, so that the managing director can sign
it and make sure that the Department is not de-
frauded. I must do this, if my transactions are
sufficiently isolated, every time the Department owes
me sixpence. If our transactions are sufficiently fre-
quent we may sign a general order of authorisation
to some particular person to collect. This means
that our managing director, 700 miles away, has only
to dig up a Justice and write his name every time
we change our office-boy instead of every time we
have a separate account.
The joke of the whole silly scheme is that the
blank order to pay which the Department sends along
in the first instance, through the post or by mes-
senger (who leaves it with the lift-man), is at least
150 times more easy to forge than a crossed cheque
payable to order sent under the same conditions. 411
you have to do is to sign on the dotted line, forge
the signature of your local station-master as a wit-
ness, go boldly and collect the boodle, and all is Wpll.
Most of the accounting Department’s employees—
whom I have always found a cheerful and courteous
lot whenever I have had to beard them in their
native lairs —would, no doubt, rejoice if the present
system could be scrapped and an ordinary business
method of payment installed in its stead. And look
at the blue paper, printing, time and profanity it
would save.
o
Throwing Open the Military Records
Book.
The Hughes Ministry has found a new
ex.-use to economise at the expense of the
Diggers: a small army of them was sacked
from Government jobs the other day on the
alleged ground that their military records
were unsatisfactory. Hew, barring those
who have served, appreciate what a military
“crime' is. m tne Army it may be a “crime”
to miss a train, protest against a public
insult, smile at the wrong time or place, or
—as sergeant or corporal of a guard—allow,
m all innocence, a shrewd prisoner to escape
trorn a primitive “clink.” Men who, as
civilians, never had a stain on their charac-
ters, were put under arrest for such offences
during the Great War; and some did hard
labor for them, An n.c.o. or private with
aI G h-iigtii or serv.ce wuo remained entirely
crimeless was a phenomenon, like the little
gui wnp uuencis sch ,oi tor years without
once being late —and this unnaturally care-
tui soiuier was usually as unsatisfactory in
other respects as the unnaturally punctual
child nearly always is. So that a "crime”
did not necessarily .carry any stigma, and
the best of men—impeccable citizens in civi-
lian life—-saw their ridiculous convictions
inscribed in their pay-books for transfer to
the records without a qualm. Their comrades
understood, and the guilty ones had the
most solemn assurances that secrets of the
sort would never be disclosed to those not in
a position to understand—employers at home,
for example. It is easy to see that without
this arrangement no intelligent man could
be induced to submit himself to military
discipline unless under the severest compul-
sion. The action of the Hughes Govern-
ment lias gone a long way to kill voluntary-
ism tor the purposes of any future war. For
it has established, by its betrayal of the
military sefcrets of those Diggers who hap-
pened to have the Government as an em-
ployer, the principle that all soldiers with
taulty records are devoid of rights in this
respect, Where any employer—State or pri-
vate enterprise—is anxious for an excuse to
put on a new man. It deals the dead-
liest blow at the preference to soldiers doc-
trine, on which, largely, the Hughes Gov-
ernment was returned to Office (the Labor-
ltes were represented as disloyalists who
could not be trusted to do the fair thing by
the men they had aspersed while the lighting
was in progress), and transfers the advan-
tages to the cold-footed person who, never
having placed himself in a position to be
crimed,” is the possessor of a technically
stainless character. Ex-soldiers have no
effective means, at present, of registering
a united protest against this breach of trust.
The politicians and clerics have divided
them too sucessfully on social and sectarian
grounds. But an opportunity will offer
when the Hughes Government goes to the
country in a few months’ time, and any
soldier who then casts his vote for a
Hugiiesite candidate should kuow that he
will be thereby endorsing not only dishonesty
of a most poisonous description, but a preee-
dent which should do much to make another
A.I.F. an impossibility.
«
The One Hope for N. S. Wales.
The debt of N. S. Wales has wandered up
to nearly £180,000,000, -and so utterly has
the State’s financial reputation burst that
this year is expected to find it paying a
higher rate than the poorest of its neigh-
bors—£s 6s. 3d. per cent, all round, as
compared with £3 10s. 3d. per cent, when
Labor first took office. With £39,000,000
of old debts, falling due this year and the
next, the prospect of getting the loan of
nearly £14,000,000 per annum of new money
to keep up the Devil’s dance amounts to
little, and a great slackening of the rail-
way-building mania is foreshadowed. The
new Government appears to have inherited
14 unfinished lines, and some of them look
as if they should be stopped short where
they are, find left there indefinitely. They
are mostly extensions, fully expected (it
might almost be said, fully intended) to be
non-payable, of old railways which are re-
markably unremunerative already. The
old contraptions are generally expected to
grow worse, partly because' the interest-
charge on each partly worn-out job becomes
heavier every time the thriftless and never-
provided-for bill has to be renewed on any
terms offering, and partly because thev serve
perishing places, the dry bones of which 10
railways apiece wouldn’t galvanise into life.
There is really not one work on the partially-
finished list which is designed to give N. S.
Wales what is necessary that its stagnant
and prematurely-aged carcase may live .again
—new ports, new sea-coast cities, new cen-
tres of population and nc-w cheap short-cuts
to the ocean and the outer world. Times are
bad beyond precedent, but the State doesn’t
want to give up railway-construction on that
account, however badly it may require to
shut up a lot of works in progress as well
as some of the finished disasters. There are
lines that it wouldn’t pay to construct or
maintain even if the capital dropped gratis
out of Heaven. These are the sort that
merely carry diminishing swags of freight
past one diminishing town after another, till
the business nerishes of exhaustion and lack
of purpose. There are others which it would
be worth while to build with money that
cost 10 per cent, per annum—always pro-
vided that the profits were devoted to pay-
ing off the State’s liabilities, and to no other
purpose. These are the sort (never to be
found on any stereotyped polit ; cian’s pros-
pectus) that, simply by furnishing short
roads to thq sea, would make new cities as
a side-line, and in addition to their mechani-
cal haulage work. Iron roads connecting
places like Coff’s Harbor. Grafton. Port
Stephens, Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay with
their hinterlands (assuming the new‘towns
were allowed a fair chance to live whpn
connected) are the sort that should brj
undertaken simply because N. .S. Wales is
short of money—so that new cities should
create money and the State be short no
longer. Nobody expects' a drv-farming line
494 miles long and ending at the Laclilnn.
to originate a fresh young Babylon beside
that skimpy stream, but the coast is a land
of hope and promise, There is no patent
or copyright or mvstery about the growth
of a great and profitable centre like Sydney.
With similar facilities it could have grown
just as readily at Eden or Jervis Bay or
Port Stephens, or at all three; and it could
still do so, It could also have grown at
Bowen or Gladstone (Q.), at Portland (Vic.)
or Albany (W.A.). Or, with the positions
reversed, Sydney might be now on the Clar-
ence, and the kangaroo might be bounding
over the assault-and-battery regions of Pal-
main, where congested man degenerates into
a mere animal, and congested woman takes
the track to perdition, and congested child-
hood gambols in an atmosphere of twp-up
and pony-racing. There is plenty of pope
for the worst of these States, if it could
find rulers blessed with imagination—the sort
who would realise that Australia is rqaily
quite young yet, even though it. may have
acquired the born-aged aspect of the back-
streets babv.
The East White Czar.
“Clifford Snook” offers an opinion:—
Possibly if the Holy Roman arrangement were
more of a constitutional monarchy and less of an
old-fashioned absolutism, it would get along better
in Roman Catholic countries and cause less fury and
L.0.L.-ism in Protestant ones. The nationals of the
R.C. State are adherents of the Church in one sense,
and in another they are nothing of the sort. They are
really its vassals, In much the same way as the Kings
of England and the Dukes of Burgundy used to be
the vassals of France, with small profit to the latter
—that is to say, they are vassals who go their own
road. And in the hopeless struggle to keep them to
their allegiance the autocrat in Rome annoys a num-
ber of spiritual aliens, and so produces an undesi-
rable state of affairs all round.
In other great Churches Parliamentary gov-
ernment has been represented, more or less,
by a Convocation, a Holy (or more or
less Holy) Synod, or some similar body.
These institutions exercised a good deni of control
over the chief spiritual authority from below, and at
places like London, Constantinople and Petrograd
the civil power exercised some from above. But
from the time when the Roman Church separated
from the parent church at Constantinople and the
Greek exarch at Ravenna, and French influence set
the vicar at Rome on the way to being both a spiri-
tual and temporal autocrat, Catholicism has believed
in absolutism. When that was the rule and not the
exception few complained, just as in. those days the
citizens of London, Paris, etc., took witch-burning
and the absence of drains for granted. But abso-
lutism has outlived its usefulness, and Rome is bound
to feel the reactions of the changer] situation, if it
isn’t doing so already.
Up to the finish of the Temporal Power the Roman
State (never amounting to much more than 12,000
square miles, or less than half the size of Tasmania)
was not only one of the white man’s lands with no
Parliamentary Government; it was almost the only
one with no hope of such a thing. It was thulast really
safe refuge of the theory of the divine right of kings.
And it was rottenly governed—not from intentional
wickedness but because all divine right countries are,
and ever must be, rottenly governed.
Perhaps if the Roman spiritual empire established
a Parliament—a wonderful cosmopolitan body in
which every predominantly Catholic country was
represented—the situation might alter. Catholic
States might regard such an organisation as, in a
sense, their own Federal Legislature, and regard its
decrees as, to some extent, their own self-made laws.
But the ukase of the last remaining white autocrat
(who is always a foreign and largely an invisible
autocrat, for none save Italians have a chance for
the Papacy now, and the Pope stays indoors), doesn't
fit in with the republican tradition. And Americans
or Portuguese who gained their independence by up-
setting the divine right of the Most Catholic King
of Spain find it a short road to questioning the
divine right of the potentate who gave the king his
divine right. The French, who upset their divine
right man in 1792, are similarly situated. Admit-
tedly this proposal—which is in plain terms that the
Church Tummas ’Enley fears should democratise it-
self —bristles, hedge-hog like, with difficulties. Yet
it would probably give the wonderful old concern a
new lease of life if it accomplished the feat. And it
would certainly ruin the best arguments of most of
its modern critics.
Fluff.
“Bio”: Lancashire, with its mills closing
down owing to the cotton shortage, has been
making exhaustive inquiries about the out-
look. And it is here that Australia ought
to come in. The boll-weevil has a strangle-
hold on the U.S.A. cotton-plant. In five
years, says Dr. L. G. Howard, there may be
no crop at all. From the 16,000,000 bales in
1911 the output has fallen 50 per cent, in
1921. Choice Sea Island, with 100,000 bales
in 1916, produced less than 2000 in 1921.
India, according to Professor Lefroy, might
greatly increase its crop if cotton reached a
shilling a pound, a price allowing for the
expense of irrigating the Sinde deserts. (Just
here the Sydney Million Farmers may note
the fact of the high cost of irrigation even in
India. A local Leeton estimate is £4O per acre
per year, requiring a bumper crop and high
prices to show a margin.) Egypt produced
a million-and-a-half bales in 1902; since
then, owing to the pink boolworm, the output
has rapidly declined. The promising coun-
tries for new plantations are said to be: the
valley of the Amazon, the hinterland of
East Africa, and parts of Australia; but
each presents varied labor difficulties, and for
this reason . in particular Australia is not
counted on as a factor in the coming cotton
famine. Yet there is this reservation: If we
adopt the already invented automatic cotton-
picker and power tractors for weeding, hand
labor may be so reduced as to make our
wage-rates commercially possible. In this
connection, it is here suggested w’e should
cultivate the variety of cotton suitable to
the machines, and so avoid Yanko methods,
where vast areas were planted with
peaches that later proved useless for the
imported canning equipment. Considering
the widespread and virulent diseases of
the cotton-plant. the biologist recalls
like happenings in the history of sugar-
cane, the tobacco-plant, the potato and the
grape-vine, and is forced to the inference
that long continuance of the same life-forms,
without soil-rest or change, leads inevitably
to a loss of vitality. China and India have
grown cotton from time immemorial, and pro-
bably have all the plagues known to the
plant; but by growing it in rotation with other
crops its vitality has-been retained, the dam-
age by pests being casual and intermittent.
Seemingly, in a new country, one crop mav
be repeatedly planted for a time (wheat
grown till the harvest does not equal the
seed, or potatoes till disease gets more than
the bags), but sooner or later the one-crop
business peters out. fertilisers and fallowing-
only delaying the inevitable. Thus. S. Aus-

tralia is finding superphosphate with wheat
is losing its magic. Warrnambool, piling on
the fertiliser, fails to get the old quality and
quantity of tubers. Dairymen on our North
Coast complain of exhausted pastures. The
Queensland sugar-cane is the easy victim of
the beetle, and the banana welcomes bunchy
top. In sharp contrast, the long-cultivated
lands of Belgium, Holland, the Channel
Islands and parts of Britain rarely have
devastating plant diseases; and the soil
is far more fertile than in its primi-
tive state. Methods vary, but always
there is a rotation of crops. And a
rotation suiting our conditions is wanted here.
Cor this purpose the cotton crop —if the Gov-
ernment and its Sydney farmers keep their
hands off it —should be welcome. Ration-
ally handled the cotton biz ought to give
the jumbuck industry a good run for the
Local Prosperity Stakes.

The Man-eaters of Europe.
Those who run the bedevilled and demented
show m Russia have got in early tins year with
an explanation of tne causes of the annual
winter famine, so that people may have the
satisfaction of knowing in the autumn
what they are to die of at Christmas-time.
Firstly, it appears that lack of seed wheat
caused some 35 per cent, of the previous
acreage to remain unsown. Quite a long
time ago it was announced that nearly 40 per
cent, of the land had passed out of cultiva-
tion, but whether this is the same lot or an
additional one doesn’t appear. If anything
were fixed or steady in the y&st lunatic
asylum speculators with real money would
have come to the country, and imported
seed wheat, and sold it to the farmers in
return for mortgages, but the Soviet con-
trols "the means of production, distribution
and exchange.” It is the sole buyer, and it
has no longer anything but cubic miles of
soiled paper to buy with. So it would appear
that Authority, in its gaudy uniform, sat
helplessly on a snowball and watched the
land remain unsown. Then locusts ate an
undue proportion of what crop there was, as
locusts will when man is too thin and miser-
able to put up a light, and disease took the
rest, as disease will when methods of cultiva-
tion grow slack. Cattle and sheep are becom-
ing rare curiosities; and rackety mismanage-
ment has so ruined the once wonderful State
forests that the fuel problem is acute. It
is Lane’s communistic New-Australia-in-
Paraguay on a million times bigger scale,
with a fatal climate thrown in, and no
means of escape. Which is why our J. S.
Garden and other prize madmen, while still
preaching Soviet methods, don’t quote Russia
as a bright and shining example after their
old fashion. In fact, the place has almost
dropped out of the communist vocabulary.
Presumably, one of these days, a sane and
human Government will get to work at re-
pairing the maddened land of frost and
debris, and the process will be one of thrill-
ing interest. When either a ship or a civili-
sation has lost its bottom and sides the work
of pumping it dry calls for care and discre-
tion. It is a far cry from cannibalism back
to the twentieth century, though the journey
from the twentieth century to cannibalism
didn’t take Russia long. Probably this
Administration which can’t even find a bag
of seed wheat has few followers left, apart
from its armed bodyguard, like De Valera,
who, save for his savage gunmen, would be
the shepherd of a sheepless flock. But among
an unarmed and terrorised populace a few
faithful gunmen count for much.
Jury-squaring and the Vic. Labor Party.
The hopeless Victorian Labor party has
chosen to make a show of opposition to the
State Government’s bill designed to make
the way of the Melbourne jury-squarer more
difficult. The main amendment proposed in
the existing procedure is in preventing the
publication of the panel, so that names and
addresses of jurymen may be known only
to a Crown Law officer (and his agent, if
any), and empanelled citizens may remain
strangers to jury-squarers and their “crook”
informants, unless, of course, a “crook”
should slip through the Crown’s challenge.
In that case, he is pretty certain to be per-
sonally known to some member of the other
side, and no chance of a conviction is pos-
sible. The Labor party’s only excuse for
cavilling at this amendment is in the in-
sinuation that the Crown, whilst thus seek-
ing to prevent “squaring” by the prisoner’s
friends, will itself acquire a monopoly _of
power to influence the verdict. According
to this amazing insinuation full and early
knowledge of the jury panel is necessary to
all interested parties for the sacred sake
of Justice. Jury-squaring by the prisoner’s
friends must remain an easy job, as at pre-
sent, in order that the Crown may not
iniquitously get a conviction. The world
at large can see no reason why the Crown
should desire to bring about by bribery the
unjust conviction of accused persons. On
the other hand, it can well understand why
Fagin should move secretly on behalf of
the Artful Dodger. But the Labor party
in Victoria is. seemingly, unable to dis-
cern any difference between the attitude of
a professional prosecutor, employed by the
State, and that of a professional “crook ’
employed to prevent fair play in a criminal
court. Premier Lawson cited a case where
the names of the jury panel were exhibited
in a two-up school, and those present were
urged to approach any of the parties they
happened to know. Whereupon he was
twitted with his inability to reel off
a list of instances in which jury-squaring
had been proved, as though actors in crim-
inal conspiracies were likely to proclaim
their guilt. The difficulty in procuring the
conviction of certain influential offenders
has been a Melbourne scandal for years
past, and, assuming the local Labor party
is anxious to put an end to that scandal, it
will either suggest some better means than
the new Juries Bill, or shut up. If, when
the debate, which Pkendergast got
adjourned for a week, is resumed, Labor
shows no disposition to do either the infer-
ence will be obvious.

The Fall of Lee.
Following on a sort of palace revolution,
the Speck’s Lee Government, which assumed
office on April 15, 1916, has faileu. Recon-
struction of the Cabinet, with Lee jetti-
soned altogether, if possible, has all along
been the aim of the Nationalist malcontents.
TUB BATTERED ROMEO.
"‘Pussyfoot’ Johnson will tour the chief cities of Australia this month in the interests of Pro-
hibition.”—News item.
PUSSYFOOT: “I only hope she treats me letter than that awful English woman did.”
In a sense, Lee rode for a fall. Though it
might have been safe to ignore the Coun-
try party, which consists of twq old Parlia-
mentarians of small tonnage and three raw
recruits, and has not been too astutely led,
it was unwise to heap derision on prominent
supporters like ex-Whip and ex-organiser
Marshall ; McPhee, who topped the
Denison poll: hard-headed Scotsman Peter
Murdoch; farmer-orator Campbell: and the
blind but capable ex-soldier Marriott.
These, or most of them, roundly accused Lee
of lack of loyalty to his faithful and long-
suffering followers, a charge which neces-
sarily implied lack of the first essential of
leadership. Marshall told the House that
the Premier’s policy speech at the opening of
the recent election campaign was prepared
and delivered without one member of the
Nationalist party having been consulted be-
forehand. If Lee were a lawyer instead
of a wheelwright, and there happened
to be a vacancy on the Supreme Court
Bench, the name of a new Judge would
possiblv have adorned the front page of a
Government Gazette some time ago. There
was the Agent-Generalship, but the commer-
cially-trained Ashbolt (formerly of Jam
Jones' co.) is understood to have achieved
something like a stranglehold on that job.
As it is, Lee, whose greed of office is as
great as ever, becomes Treasurer under his
former lieutenant, Hayes, who takes the
portfolios of Works and Agriculture in addi-
tion to the Premiership. Blyth, the Cocky
leader, enters the Cabinet as Minister of,
Lands and Agriculture. McPhee becomes
Chief Secretary in place of Snowden.
Propsting remains as Attorney-General,
and Hean also stays on, but only as one of
the honorary Ministers, Shields being the
other. On paper ; the new Government com-
mands 17 votes m a House of 30. But its
future will depend on whether it has under-
gone a change of spirit as well as a change
of name.

When Ireland is cleared, as it presumably
will be some day, of the murderers and bri-
gands who are at present acting in armed de-
fiance of its Government the oft-debated
question will arise of the culpability of :
(1) The plain killer whose motive may be robbery,
revenge or anything else, but whose crime is a soli-
tary one, so that it injures only the victim and his
family—if any. This criminal usually gets death or
a life-sentence.
(2) The person who does killing and robbery on a
fur larger scale and aggravates his crime 100-fold by
declaring that his object is to deprive the nation of
its most precious possession—its right of free self-
government, and to enslave it permanently, or at
least indefinitely, under the domination of himself
and an armed, violent and lawless minority.
The latter calls himself a patriot, thus add-
ing hypocrisy to his other sins. There is a
world of difference between a Garibaldi,
fighting for no personal reward (for he
accepted none) to establish the rule of the
people in place of that of a minority of
monopolists and their parasites, and a De
Valera, fighting a wild-beast row to replace
popular self-government by the supremacy
of himself and his camarilla. The slayers
of Sir Henry Wilson, who were hanged
last week, could at least plead provocation,
the good old “unwritten law” that has freed
so many desperate criminals; for Wilson
was one of those who advocated “relentless
severity” (i.e., wholesale slaughter) in Ire-
land. De Valera, of the U.S., can put up
no such defence. He is apparently causing
death and destruction out of a mere spirit of
vain-glor iou sness.
“Wart” : The Victorian manufacturing-
jewellers have an association which registers
their private stamps, and through the asso-
ciation they hold themselves responsible for
the quality of their goods. That is all right
as far as it goes, but it applies only to one
State, and not to all the manufacturers in
that State. In 1921 the Australian jewel-
lery manufacturers decided to form a hall-
marking company. Being good Australians
.they resolved that the kookaburra for a
design would be able to laugh down any sus-
picion that he w r as not as good as the Eng-
lish lion. Here is the history of the Sydney
hallmarking company’s first round with Bar-
nacle :—
September C, 1921. Application for registration
forwarded to Melbourne.
September SO. Notification from Department that
the application was numbered 31,697.
October 14. Letter to Department inquiring about
progreu of application.
October 21. Answer that application was then
before the examiner, whose report would be “avail-
able shortly.’’
November 15. Letter inquiring whether the exami-
ner’s report was yet available.
November 22. Reply setting out certain objections
to design.
December 2. Inquiry whether if application was
amended so as to provide for a standardisation mark,
the objections would be waived.
December 15. Reply that the objections would
apply to a standardisation-mark.
January 9, 1922. Application for a hearing before
the Registrar, on hi» next visit to Sydney.
January 14. Reply that a hearing would be
arranged.
February 6. Department fixes hearing
February 7. Interview with Registrar, who seeded
quite a reasonable Barnacle, agreeing to waive objec-
tions and to expedite matters.
February 11. Amended application forwarded to
Melbourne.
March 10. Letter to Department inquiring about
progress.
March 20. Department sends letter with requi-
sition.
March 22. Requisition answered and Department
asked to get a move on.
April 3, Block of design forwarded to Melbourne,
though not asked for by Department, as the Sydney
office said such a block would be necessary before the
matter was finalised.
April 24. Letter asking for information as to
what was being done.
May 1. Department writes that application has
been sent on for Ministeral approval, and that, on
return of documents, the matter would be proceeded
with.
Thus endeth the first round, with all the
points to Barnacle. When last heard of
the kookaburra was laughing like blades in
Barnacle’s office.

The same old scrag-end of platitude from
the usual daily paper:—
In a speech at Bendigo Mr. Hughes declared that
the White Australia policy was the corner-stone of
the temple in which we lived. He said that the
tropkal parts of Australia could be fully developed
by white labor.
He might, with equal usefulness, have de-
clared that “Z” is, and will probably remain,
the last letter of the alphabet, or that over-
proof brandy tends to inebriate when taken
in profusion, and must ever do so. The
tragedy is that the huge province which
Hughes has ruled directly for eight years,
and the’bne where the cause of White Aus-
tralia is most distinctly at stake, is less
white than it was 22 years ago, inasmuch
as there are fewer white people there. A
place isn’t made white because black men
don’t live there; if this were so the White
Sea-bottom would he the admiration of the
Caucasian world. A country is whitened
by white population, and W. M. Hughes
seems as good as an epidemic at scaring
away that sort of population. People don’t
go to the Federal North from the southern
States that have a few folk to spare be-
cause it may take three months to get
there instead of the four to six days
which should suffice, and when the pilgrim
has arrived and found nothing doing, save
lukewarm beer, he departs with consider-
able celerity, if he can. It is a dishonest
as well as a futile thing to boast about
your corner-stone if you are continually
undermining the support; and that, in fact,
is what Hughes has been doing fot years
in respect of the White Australia policy, of
which he talks so much.
o
“G.S.”: Has Massy Greene included
amongst the brass-hats to be compulsorily re-
tired those responsible for the loss in bringing
to Australia from England several thousands
of useless G.S. waggons? At Seymour rail-
way station it was found impossible to trans-
port these waggons, even when empty, on their
own wheels. A casual examination by an ama-
teur would have made it obvious that the
timber in the majority was in the last stages
of decay through dry rot. It is odds on
that the officer responsible is not amongst
those compulsorily retired. In accordance
with the traditions of the service it is more
than likely that he has received accelerated
promotion; possibly on the grounds that by
bringing the rubbish out he has enabled the
Commonwealth Bine to show a profit, since it
filled many a ship of the line at £5 and £0
per ton.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From Queensland comes a political item
that is sensational enough for a movie film.
It is alleged that somebody has been attempt-
ing to buy out, bribe or nobble Premier
Theodore’s majority of one with £3OOO in
Treasury bonds and £2OO in notes. The
Labor legislator who notified the detectives
that lie was being pressed to assess his honor
at this figure, or thereabouts, is Frank
Brennan. Two journalists, John Sleeman
and Edward Connolly, were arrested on
Monday night and charged conjointly with
attempted bribery After the charge had
been outlined by barrister Macrossan, they
were remanded for a week. Sleeman was,
till a few months ago, editor of the Bris-
bane Sun. Prior to that he was engaged
in publicity and organising work for the
Queensland Nationalists. He began his
press career 11 years ago on the W.A. gold-
fields and the staff of the Kalgoorlie Sun.
In those days he was a Laborite, but he
parted company with the A.L.P. on the con-
scription issue.
In the latest confused shindy between
Free-Staters and Republicans in Ireland the
former are reported to have acquired Cork.
But inasmuch as the rebels have a habit
of coming down from the hills, when the
Government army lias moved on, and re-
occupying the police barracks and the post
office, to say nothing of the pubs, the acquisi-
tion is not so significant as it seems. On
the other hand, the sudden death of Arthur
Griffith is a real disaster to the Free State
cause. The brain behind the Sihn Fein
movement, Griffith did more than any other
man to bring about the treaty with Britain,
and it is a calamity to both countries that
he should be called away, at 50, before his
work had been consolidated.
“Gallery”: The Hughes Government is
taking no chances these tempestuous days.
Though assured of a majority against Charl-
ton’s _ censure motion on the eternal sugar
question, it routed out Groom, who was
already paired with Stewart, thus compel-
ling the latter to forget his influenza and
attend the division. It is likewise alleged
that Gregory, who has been in hospital for
weeks, was allowed a pair for the Noes,
whilst Prowse was refused the same privi-
lege when he was called away suddenly on
account of the death of his mother. Earle
Page, the Cockies’ urbane general, has be-
come so annoyed at these tactics that he
is threatening drastic reprisals. The fact
that the Government has also twice spurned
his no-confidence motion —once by means of
the gag—is a further inducement to get into
his warpaint and make his influence felt.
Harvey, M.L.A. of South Australia (not
to be confused with W. H. Harvey, of the
Leg. Council), has apologised humbly for a
reference to the slain soldiers of Australia
as “dead meat.” His miserable explanation
was that the word “tripe” was being freely
used in interjection at the moment, and.
apparently, analogy, carried him hastily into
the use of the horrible expression. Speaker
Richard Butler accepted the offender’s “sin-
cere regret,” but the electors have yet to be
heard from. Judging by the storm of indig-
nation that the deadly insult has stirred
up outside Parliament, they are not likely
forget Harvey in a hurry.
From one of his constituents:—
Give Francis, M.H.R. for Henty (Vic.), his due. He
may possibly be “a marked man” (B. 3/8/’22) when
he goes before his constituents, but he won’t “ask
for a renewal of his £lOOO a year.” Francis is one
of the few who voted against the salary grab and
backed up their votes by not taking it. He still
receives the old white pay-in slip which records that
£5O has been placed to his credit for a month's
work. Moreover, the man entered Parliament
pledged not to vote for an increase in the number
of members. Had he supported Earle Page’s scheme
for 76 Reps, he would have broken that pledge.
It was a very half-hearted Peacock who
introduced the bill exempting Melbourne—
or that part of it bounded by Flinders,
Spring, Victoria and Spencer streets—from
the 7 p.m. closing of. fruitshops in winter.
Teased by Digger Webber as to whether
he believed in the measure, Alec said the
Cabinet had passed it and he “recommended”
it. If he had only “recommended” other
factory- and shop-legislation as half-heart-
edly there would not be much of it law now.
The bill is in for a rough time.
THE OPTIMIST.
THEEDORE : "She’s pretty frightful as she is, hut she should look letter in her new
Spring frock.”
The story of the Glenreagh-Dorrigo
(N.S.W.) railway, which is likely to cost
over a million for 44 miles of single track, is
a copious essay on the art of doing things
upside-down. At first there was such sud-
den haste over the long-neglected job that
work was started at both ends. So half the
ponderous material was dragged 40 miles
along and 2000 ft. up by muddy dray over
muddy road at mud-headed cost. (Those
were the days when the Labor Government
had farmed out its railway-building to the
Xorton-Griffith people, who were paid com-
mission on what they spent.) Then the
Government rushed madly to the other ex-
treme, and stopped work altogether, and the
stacks of material at the far end, 2000 ft. high,
were abandoned, it being too costly to bring
them back. And the mental hospital still
yawns in vain for the fools w r ho were behind
the enterprise.
MacDonald, the accidental Senator from
Queensland, is subject to fits of depression.
He sees in the electoral redistributions, or,
at least, the Queensland scheme “a deli-
berate attempt to make it very difficult, if
not impossible, for the Labor party ever to
regain political control of the Common-
wealth.”
The Queensland divisions have been so re-arranged
that there is little prospect of Labor winning two of
the seats, even if we had such a swing as in 1913-14.
N. S. Wales also may lose several seats as compared
with 1914. I see one possible loss to Labor in Vic-
toria, and there is a prospective loss in S.A. as well.
And the worst of it is that the pessimist
himself will have to face the electors next
year. It looks as if he would sell his
chance cheap.
“Clifford Snook”: Reported the other day
that Benjamin and John Fuller had bought
a modest block at the corner of King and
Elizabeth streets, Sydneyjfpr £75,000. Now
in the rising city of Ciniord (named after
me), seaport and capital of the new and ris-
ing State of, say, Baradine (Northern
N.S.W.), the esteemed Benjamin and the in-
valuable John, by getting in early, could get
a bigger and even more central block for £7so—
with all its future before it instead of
£75,000 worth of past behind it. Why a
hackneyed generation sticks so hard to the old
hackneyed goldfield, where only men with big
capital can operate, while by cutting up the
huge States it might have a dozen new fields
suited to men of small means, is this country’s
mystery. Even hardened property agents
seem too dull-wited to see the point.
Walter West, sec. of Traralgon Shire
(Vic.), is making a big effort to capture
the South Gippslaml seat which the late
Tom Livingston held for 20 years. Arrayed
ag’in him are a fellow-Liberal, 11. J. York,
and Martin Boland, the Cocky candidate.
All are thorough Gippslanders. Donald
McLeod is the most notable instance of a
municipal clerk getting into Yic. Parliament
and attaining a status there. If lie had
arrived 10 years earlier he might have col-
lared the Premiership. But McLeod had a
reputation outside Daylesford as an autho-
rity on local government, whereas West’s
fame has never spread west of his own
burgh. Lawson is working hard for West
and York, as Labor, (21) and the F.U.
party (12) control 33 of the 64 Assembly
votes, excluding the Speaker. And his Lib-
erals are in three or four groups at that.
“Swansider’s”. story:—
A somewhat (lour, fanatical person is Rep. Prowse
(W.A.), who has forced himself to the fore in the
Federal Country party by never omitting a chance
of speaking. Prowse, who is an ex-Mayor of Perth,
where he was formerly in the insurance line, would
have foregone his rum ration with no discomfort if
he had been a soldier, and can tell you the probable
destination of the Pope in one syllable. A story is
told of hbw, the last time he was touring his Swan con-
stituency, he compared one of his opponents to “Nero
fiddling while Rome was burning.” An argumenta-
tive person who had been dipping his beak into the
bowl that Prowse abhors cut in with a drunken side-
issue. “Yesh, but I’ll betcher dunno why Nero
fiddled.” Prowse, who is not the man to alienate
any vote unnecessarily, smiled indulgently. “To
denote his utter unconcern at human suffering as
long as it didn’t affect his own selfish enjoyment,”
he explained in his best pulpit manner. “Wrongsh,”
hiccoughed the interrupter dogmatically. “He fiddled
while Rome (hie) burned because he was a blauky
(hie) Orangeman!” The yell that followed made
several horses bolt outside the hall.
Queensland’s Labor Government is an-
cient, though not venerable, as /Govern-
ments go. Last week it weighed in with
its eighth Budget. In its early financial
essays it undertook to make everybody
affluent by means of loans. Later on, the
country was to be taxed into prosperity.
That expedient failing like the other, “the
salaries of Ministers, M’s.L.A. and certain
Government employees are being reduced;
also, the requirements of the services have
been cut to the bone.” Nevertheless, the
deficit is expected to amount to £576.540.
Having achieved for Queensland a moun-
tainous debt, the highest taxation in Aus-
tralia and a chronic deficit, the Theodores
are getting ready to quit. When Labor Min-
isters go in for retrenchment it is a sign
that they have abandoned hope.
“ J.E.” sums up the position:—
The person who drafted the terms on which aione
the employees offered to resume business at the New-
castle steel works had his full share of nerve. The
44-houi week reduced the earnings of the concern
by one-twelfth, and orders had ceased to come in.
The men’s representatives offered to accept a slight
reduction of war wages, but not enough to allow
the owners any profit. The reduction was to be a
debt which the owners were to pay off out of the
first profits, restoring the old war pay as an eternal
permanency at the same time. So if the company
began to earn a trifle for itself in, say, 1928, it
might find itself owing so many hundred thousands
of back pay that it couldn’t hope for a dividend
till 1936 or later. On the other hand, if it kept its
works closed it would not only save wear a.nd tear
of plant, but It would owe no huge dead horse of
debt when it resumed in 1928. Also, the union
bosses might be in a more accommodating frame of
mind after a rest. The owners, having studied the
terms and grasped that they offered them the choice
of working hard, getting nothing and piling up huge
debts and wage liabilities that would make their
property quite valueless and unsaleable, or do.'ng a
care-free loaf without debt or commitments, resolved
to loaf. There are times when loafing may be said
to be mandatory, and this was one of them.
Up t 9 the end of June within £lO,OOO of
Oi millions sterling was spent on the elec-
trification of Vic. suburban railways. The
original estimate was “about £4,000.000.”
Parliament has voted another £1.150,000, and
State Treasurer McPherson reckons that
this amount, with £150.000 he is hoping to
get as rebate of Customs revenue, ought to
be sufficient. The electrification of the rail-
ways was one of Watt’s stunts. Time has
yet to justify his anticipations, but cheap
power from Morwell (also at a higher price
than the estimate) will help when it arrives.
A Sydney paper made a pilgrimage to the
Glebe lately, it being that slum’s turn to be
written down, for every slum has its day.
The usual disclosures resulted, and they
may be summarised as follows: —
The place is, to a great extent, horrible, and past
repair, with mean streets, lanes and alleys. It is
naturally growing older and worse.
It can’t be destroyed and rebuilt with the inhabi-
tants in it.
There is no place within an impossible quantity
of miles where such a horde can move to if ejected
from the condemned tenements. For want of harbor
bridges and city or suburban railways (on the
ground, underground or overhead), two miles in
and around Sydney is, in many directions and for
practical purposes, more than five miles in ordinary
cities. Sydney is crowded on a smaller and more
slummy space than Melbourne because, without
these conveniences, people can’t get away unless
they spend half their time and wages! in travelling.
The necessary railways, bridges, etc., are due in
about 35 years, Greenwich time.
The area really accessible from the business centre
has already, perhaps, 30 per cent, more people than
a civilised place should have. It expects to have
300 per cent more before improvements are com-
plete.
If it is mentioned that, with some new
States, new capitals with new business
centres, and new ports, the pressure on
Sydney—including Glebe and Woolloomoo-
loo —might be immensely relieved, and that
no other way has been suggested, the anger
of the political people who live within smell
of Glebe is terrible. Why fuss about Glebe
and its inhabitants, they ask, in effect?
They are institutions. Let them ripen in
the sun.
Under Holman, and after him Under Dooley,
almost every new public work in N.S.W.
became a relief work. Thus the Glenreagh-
Dorrigo railway, which lias dawdled along
since 1910 (Holman’s first year), is now
tottering to a conclusion at an average cost
of £25,000 a mile, whereas £7OOO would have
been ample. A returned toiler from up that
way lately described the North Coast railway
job to a Bulletin man, with pardonable
enthusiasm, as the best in his experience. A
man, he explained, had to be there with a
shovel or something in his hand, but doing
anything with the implement was never in-
sisted on. He seemed to regard the society
of the weapon as a foolish superfluity.
A GLORIOUS START.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“hi the preface of the ‘History of the Genoa
Conference,’ Mr. Lloyd George states that the peace
campaign is only beginning.”
Our sacred Peace Campaign is but a few years old,
and yet
It has accomplished cheerful things the world may
not forget;
For scarcely had the gathered clans arranged for
lasting peace,
When suddenly the fun began, as Turkey challenged
Greece;
The Pole got wild and scrapped the Hun, the Latvian
followed suit,
The Czecho-Slav bashed Hungary, and then put in
the boot;
The Bolshie moved on Turkestan; old China split in
three,
Which started each to murder all in peace-bred
ecstasy ;
The Japs chewed up Manchuria ’mid sleet and Arctic
hail;
The Indians uprose and yelled, till Ghandi went to
gaol;
The Irish riot grew to war, the Persians made a fuss,
The Gyppos took to bombs to prove their peaceful
love of us;
The Arabs in Damascus swept the Christians from
thei» home;
The Dagoes turned Fascisti and tore up the streets
of Rome;
While at the sacred Conference, as if of calm bereft,
Japan assailed America, and France got wild and
left;
Till, dazed with din of biff and threat, the person-
in-the-street.
Whose income-taxes foot the bills when conferences
meet,
Can only stare around him, full of awe, and muse
amain:
“If this be but the early stage of Peace’s sweet
Campaign,
How loud will roar the cannon, how swift the blood
will flow,
When Peace has been established, say, for twenty
years or sol”

This co.’s wonderful run, which began
with the war, came to an abrupt end hist
year, and the latest accounts indicate that
little more than one-third of the amount paid
in divs., was actually earned during the 12
months ended May 31. Owing to collapsed
values the volume of insurances was smaller
than in any year since 1916. With the ex-
ception of the ’Frisco disaster year the loss-
rate was heavier than in any other term
of which The Bulletin has' record, and
operations were more costly than at any
other time, due partly to 'heavy taxation.
This comparison gives a general view of the
underwriting experience over many years :

For 1921, the year of record profits, 87.3
p.c. of net premium income went in losses
and expenses: for last year 103.7 p.c., under-
writing for the period thus having resulted
in a loss. The directors’ report shows a
surplus on the year’s operations” of
£40,394; ' actually there was a loss of
£39,605 on underwriting. How the £54,432
profit shown in the introductory table was
arrived at is show r n hereunder:—
Net premiums £1,087,616
Losses £756,469
Expenses 370,752
—• 1,127,221
Underwriting loss £39,605
Interest from investments .. .. 94,037
Net surplus as per table .. .. £64,432
At the 1921 balance there was £BO,OOO in
a reserve for taxation, but £20,000 has since
been extracted. So the net surplus for the
period was evidently only £34,432.
Even that £34,432 cannot be regarded as
profit actually earned, provision for unex-
pired risks on the business which contributed
to the year’s income not having been taken
into consideration in the above calculations.
Though payment of the usual 13J p.c. div.
(£100,000) for this adverse year has left
the co. visibly weaker by £66,000, it is still
a very powerful insurance office. Now that
premium income has shrunk, reserves of the
size of those held in recent years for unex-
pired risks are no longer required, so the
£625,000 on hand in 1921 had been cut to
£545,000 at the latest balance, £35,000 of it
having been added to general reserves, and
the balance having been dropped into P. and
L. account. That £545,000 was equal to
50 p.c. of last year’s net premium income, and
10 points more than is generally considered
necessary to reserve for unexpired risks. In
addition to that specific reserve the N. Z.
Insurance had half-a-million more in other
accumulations after payment of the final
div. Including the £750.000 of paid
capital funds exceed £1,800,000, equal
to 165 p.c. of the year’s net premiums.
Funds 1$ times the size of premium income
are generally deemed reasonable protection
for policy-holders. In 1917 the proportion
got as low 7 as 121 p.c., but the huge reserves
accumulated in the abnormal period and the
shrinkage of premiums have made the co.’s
position from this, point of view stronger
than at any time since the mid-’nineties.
. Shareholders have had a w r onderful feast
since the.war sent values soaring and created
a boom in trade. Only 10 years ago paid
capital was £300,000, and though not a penny
b^ en ca^e< J «P it has expanded to
±< 50,000, reserve transfers providing all the
new scrip So on the capital of 1910 the
P-*J- div. paid nowadays gives a return
of 33* p.c. An outstanding feature of the
N. Z. Insurance is that owing to the larger
volume of investments and improved interest
rates 94 p.c. 9f the £lOO,OOO required for the
Idt P-c. divs. is provided by investment returns.
Consequently all except a few thousands of
any profit derived from underwriting is avail-
able for strengthening reserves. Profits on
the scale of those of the boom years are not
to be expected in the near future, but both
in strength as an underwriter and as a div-
payer, the N. Z. Insurance is decidedly com*
fortable.
The book value of all assets at Mav 31
was £2,367,226, which was £102.241 less than
12 months before. That reduction has not
been due wholly to the payment of divs.
which were not earned during the period.
The accounts formerly included £62,500 of
investments of the staff pension fund, but
they were withdrawn during the year and
given into the care of the executor and
trustee branch of the co., concerning which
no information is tendered except at share-
holders’ meetings. The withdrawal of the
staff-pension fund probably also accounts for
the disappearance of £lB4O from the invest-
ment fluctuat’on reserve, shown as written
off in the introductory table. Including

(£248.510) with liabibties, net assets at Mav

That decline of £67,408 was the excess of
the year’s outgoings, including divs.. over

Only in one other year have net profits
been larger, but portion of latest earnings
would, under normal trading conditions,
have show.n up in 1921. In that financial
year the bottom fell out of the wool market
and sales were suspended; consequently, at
the close of the year 16,500 bales were in
store unsold, compared with 70 bales 12
months previously. Demand and prices hav-
ing recovered, the past year’s earnings have
been assisted materially by the marketing of
old stocks. The only satisfactory method
of gauging recent profit-earning is to average
results for the two years. In fact, at any
time in a business like this, dependent as it
is on erratic seasons and variable markets,
earning capacity should be judged on aver-
ages over a period of some years. For the
24 months ended June 30 last net profits
averaged £22,732 per annum, and as that
represented more than 15 p.c. on paid capital
the co. pulled through the disturbed period
very successfully. They are remarkable re-
sults considering the poorer opportunities in
the live-stock market, and the collapse of
the boom in hides and skins.
Pitt, Son and Badgery is one of the most
successful cos. in the pastoral-agency busi-
ness. Paid capital is not large: the co. is
mostly an agency-concern, and does not
dabble in pastoral finance. The £82,306 of
sundry debts shown i.n the latest accounts
are probably mostly advances on live-stock
and produce in process of marketing. A
dozen years ago paid capital was only
£60,000; at June 30 it was £150,000. But
every penny of the extra £90,000 is capital-
ised profit. The directors do not put it
that way: on seven occasions in the period
covered by the first table they have declared
“special bonuses,” which have been applied to
the purchase of new shares at par. The
10 p.c. divs. now paid are, therefore, very
sweet for shareholders who took up the new
shares. The directors are once more dip-
ping into surplus profits for another gift
issue. A bonus equal to the year’s div.
has been declared to give one free share for
every 10 held, at Sept. 30 next.
The co. nowadays is very snug. The
present position and balance-sheet movements
since 1914 are shown hereunder:—

The directors’ report, to which Agar Wynne
appends his signature as chairman, has no-
thing to say concerning the year’s opera-
tions. But Dennys-Laseelles’ directors are
to be commended for continuing to publish
informative accounts. It is a common prac-
tice nowadays for managements to confine
their statement of earnings to one entry giv-
ing the period’s profit, shareholders and in-
vestors being entirely in the dark as to how
that profit was derived. This co. gives de-
tails in its Profit and ix>ss accouuts:—
Gross Profits Salaries Other
and Commissions, and Wuges. Expenses.

1921.. 45,614 18,917 15,079
1922.. 66,026 23,670 16,618
Owing chiefly to the revival of the wool mar-
ket gross earnings last year were an improve-
ment on the figures for 1920, but heavier
exes, were the bugbear, the wages list having
been £3325 larger, and other exes, having
taken £llB2 more.
m Shareholders have now had 10 years of
7 p.c. divs., and that is a poor return for a
co. of Dennys-Lascelles size in the pastoral
agency business. Average annual profits for
the 10 years have been only slightly more
than those the late E. 11. Lascelles had been
harvesting during the half-dozen vears prior
to the public co. taking over. The transfer
was effected at an unfortunate time for
shareholders: shortly after the co. acquired
the well-established business (£50,000 in
scrip was paid for goodwill) the Vic. West-
ern Districts suffered a severe drought.
Apparently the recovery was not swift
enough to give handsome profits on the scale
shown by some agency concerns during the
years of boom markets. Though 7 p.c. has
been a mild return, shareholders have re-
ceived that rate of div. regularly, and mean-
time their investment has been considerably
strengthened by accumulated surplus profit.
During the past seven years £32.000-odd has
been laid aside, and now only £19,617 of the
paid capital of £150.000 is represented by
the intangible goodwill asset. Consequently,
though nearly £BOOO more is now in pro-
perty and plant that at the first balance—
the co. extended its interests to the Mel-
bourne live-stock market several years ago
—the management has been able to reduce
liabilities by almost £20,000, and at the
same time find £5600 more for clients, besides
holding £3OOO of War Loan. Balance-sheet
figures have moved in this wav since the
co.’s first accounts were issued in 1913 •

claimed to be the most up-to-date in the
Commonwealth. They were acquired at less
than their actual worth in- 1912, and have,
no doubt, appreciated in value since then. In
other respects the co. appears to have been
made more comfortable, and provided the
management continues to be efficient share-
holders may look forward to receiving a bit
more than 7 p.c.

The troubles Wm. Adams and Co. experi-
enced in its 1921 financial year did not ease
during the past 12 months. It has a big
nnnuig connection, but that industry has
been so depressed that there has been very
small demand for stores, etc. Building-
trade operations were also seriously affected
by the Commonwealth Government throwing
on the market at cut-prices huge stocks
which had been purchased at the top of the
market for war-service homes. Meantime
the engineering trade has had a very dull
time, and besides employing only half the
normal number of workmen in its own works
this co. had small demand in its trading
branches. Twelve months ago very large
stocks were held, and while turnover suffered
values have also been steadily declining.
Considering all the difficulties of the period
the co. did very well to come through with
a loss of only a few hundred pounds, after
making provision for depreciation. The
directors in their report give a detailed
account of the troubles of the period, and
they are not over-confident about the imme-
diate future —“it may take another year,”
they say, “to remedy the unsettled state of
affairs.” An important matter on which they
have nothing to say is as to the basis of
valuation on which stocks were taken at the
balancing-date. However, “only a small pro-
portion of the co.’s stocks was held during
the whole period.” ’Murkan exchange
has been fairly stable for several months,
and as there is little likelihood of any further
serious collapse of values no heavy losses
should be incurred on the stocks held at tin-
latest balance, though, on the other hand,
owing to continued industrial depression,
little profit can be expected.
The worst of the co.’s troubles were evi-
dently experienced in the latter half of the
financial year: after striking a balance in
October last the directors passed out a div.
Consequently the co. slipped back £BlOO after
making depreciation allowances, leaving only
£1270 in reserve, after providing cover for
the £10,500 of goodwill, compared with
£13,889 three years ago. The co. was
established nearly 25 years ago, but the pub-
lic has been interested only four years, dur-
ing which time considerable new capital has
been got in from outside. Nearly half the
shares are still held by old proprietors and
their families and employees. Since accounts
w’ere first made public balance-sheet move-
ments huve been as follows: —
1917. 1920. 1921. 1922.
Paid capital £94,900 £197,379 £248,224 £248,950
Liabilities . . 122,883 224,051 230,404 194,510
Freeholds, etc. 45,218 74,025 76,000 91,960

Shares .. Oil 1,438 2,039 17,029
Cash .. 803 3,467 2,528 770
Total assets, apart from goodwill, had a book
value of slightly more than half a million at
April 30, compared w ith £223,000 five years
ago. So, though £154,056 of new capital
has been got in, liabilities are much heavier.
Stock and book debts at the balance totalled
£307,234, which was £124,71S in excess of
all liabilities apart from a £12,000 mortgage
on properties. The co. has branches in each
State and has purchased freeholds in all
centres. They were recently independently
valued at £114,700, or £22,744 more than
their book value.
When is a pref. share not a pref. share?
This riddle arises from a consideration of
Musgrove’s Palais de Danse float. Harry
Musgrove and others propose to erect and
conduct a winter and summer dancing-pavi-
lion on the Bondi (Sydney) ocean-front, and
a prospectus is out inviting the public to
provide the necessary cash. It is offered
15,000 fl prefs. carrying a cumulative 15
p.c. p.a., and the only other shares are 2000
£1 deferreds, which are a gift to the vendors
for putting the public on to. the good thing.
Investors have become accustomed to regard
preference shares as offering good security
and a reasonable prospect of regular divs. at
a fixed rate. This venture is highly specu-
lative, which is fully acknowledged by the
vendors whe_n they suggest that the public
should get 15 p.c. before they get a cut. The
prospect of regular divs. at that rate and
security for capital depend on the dancing
craze continuing, oji good management and
other things. In the generally-accepted sense
these shares, though carrying “rights,” are
not preference shares, but ordinaries with
prior claims to the vendors’ gift
scrip, which are really deferred ordi-
naries. The vendors may, perhaps,
claim to show faith in the enterprise
by accepting these deferreds—indeed, they
anticipate a 36 p.c. p.a. return on £17,000
paid capital—but as they are not called upon
to put in a penny, and it is expressly stipu-
lated that they shall be directors (“manage-
ment and administration, £3O per week”)
they have nothing to lose. The £15,000 which
the public is invited to subscribe does not
secure freehold premises; it will provide the
pavilion and six shops—no precise building
cost is given—on land held on 10 years’
lease, but which can be purchased by the co.
during the term of the lease for' £15.000.
Should the promoters’ estimates materialise,
the two classes of shares will participate
50-50 in any profit in excess of 15 p.c. on
all scrip.

Secretary F. M. Dickenson is out with pre-
liminai-y figures for the B. H. Prop.’s year
ended May. Profits since 1915 have been as
follows: —
1915.. .. £321,827 | 1919.. .. £652,342
1916.. .. 486,528 | 1920.. .. 517,663
1917.. .. 426,198 i 1921.. .. 351,331
1918.. .. .650,587 | 1922.. .. 103,300
An examination of the balance-sheet will be
necessary to ascertain how that profit was
derived, and to what extent settlements on
pi-oduction of metals in previous terms have
helped. Capital expenditure for the past year
was £890,896, against £1,215,318 for 1921.
Fred Thonemann was hauled on to the
carpet by the Melbourne Stock Exchange
committee the other day because he circu-
larised shareholders of the Australian Paper
Mills about a new issue of 100,000 £1 shares.
This cash is wanted for reasons that were
not stated by the Boai-d. His sin against
the brokers was that he sent the circular to
all the shax-eholders, to whom he was to allow
6d. a share commission. As a director of the
co. Thonemann, under the articles of asso-
ciation, was within his rights in acting as
underwriter; but brokei-s objected violently
to circulars going to shareholders who were
their own pet clients, and stormed at the
issue being offered without a prospectus or
financi -statement. The domestic disturb-
ance wa not worth the hot air and chest
swelling, but the last objection was thor-
oughly sound. The result is that the share-
holder gets the right to look at a balance-
sheet to see if the goods in the window are
worth having. And as Thonemann won’t
offend again, everything is peaceful once
more.

“Quidnunc”: Colin Fraser, managing
director of Associated Smelters-, must be
credited with: being an adept at specious
camouflage. Recently he specifically advo-
cated an “export duty on ores and concen
trates,” but the storm of opoosition which
that suggestion aroused has caused him to
changes the terms, if not the intention of it.
He now talks of “Government assistance of
some kind to tide the Australian lead-smelt-
ing and refining industry over a temporary
period during which foreign competition, due
to depreciated exchange, would obtain.” Of
course Mr. Fraser is not aware that dealings
in Austi*alian metals which have been per-
mitted under severe war-time regulations
have all been based on London exchange
rates! He admits that he is ignorant of the
fact that restrictions are such as to make it
almost-impossible for the ordinary producer
to have such dealings. The “foreign com-
petition” which he writes about has not
existed since 1914, and does not exist even
now: the small producer is not “free to sell
his ore to foreign buyers.” In denial of the
assertion that Associated Smeltei-s have, ox-
wish to have, a monopoly of lead-smelting in
Australia, Mr. Fraser makes the innocent
statement that “Ihe Cockle Creek woi-ks are
being maintained intact.” Will he answer
these questions: (1) Has not the Sulphide
Corporation joined the Associated Smelters?
(2) Are not the products of the Central
mine to be treated at Port Pirie? (3) And is
not the lead section of Cockle Creek right
out of commission and likely to remain so
for ever?
What the small producer wants now is
the prompt removal of the harassing re-
sti-ictions on the sale of his product,
that he may deal with whomsoever he
pleases without having to fill in a
hundred forms (more or less) and be
subjected to the insult of having to go, it
may be, to some glorified marine-store dealer
to get a permit signed, with the added injury
of.. having to pay a commission for the
pi-ivilege. If it be true, as Mr.
Fx-aser asserts, that despite overseas buy-
ers competing for ores, Associated Smelt-
ers have secured conti-acts .for 12 months
for the “whole of the outputs of the
thi-ee principal silver-lead producers in east-
ern N.S.W., and is purchasing from the
smaller producers on terrhs regai-ded by
them as very satisfactory,” and that large
shipments are going forward from Tasmania
to Pirie, where is the necessity for an export
duty to “pi-otect an efficient lead-smelting
industry in Austi-alia”? It is significant
that in his latest effusion Mr. Fraser care-
fully refrains from dii-ect advocacy of pro-
tection for the zinc-smelting industry.

Oil-sand has been passed through at Roma
(Q.) at a depth of 2815 ft., and the find was
considered important enough to send Arthur
Moore post-haste to Brisbane with samples
and to cause the Petroleum Advisory Com-
mittee to be hurriedly summoned for last
Thursday. The samples sent down con-
tained 35 p.c. of 50 p.c. petroleum, and
needless to say are welcomed as evidence
that the Roma strata do contain the precious
fluid. Roma petrol hitherto has all been
extracted from the gas flow. Although it has
yet to be proved that there is a flow of oil,
the find is most encouraging for eventually
finding commercial supplies . at Roma, or
other spots whex-e structural conditions are
proved favorable for the retention of oil-
pools. The fact that the oil was not
recorded in the previous bore only shows
that some drillers are not as careful as they
ought to be in testing every few feet.
Queensland seems to have, in Arthur Moore,
a man who will give Roma a good run for.
its money. The Committee decided to cease
boring and test the sand for a flow. It is
at present, of course, under a big water
column.
The news of the oil strike at Roma will
no doubt hearten the men who are going
to give the Lower Walloon formation, in the
Beaudesert district, a run for oil, as the
formation there is said to be identical with
that at Roma. The site is not likely to be
near Dunn’s bore, which was investigated
last month as a possible seep. Dr. Jensen
was recently in the district making investi-
gations ; as to the best probable site. Two
oil-prospecting licenses have been granted by
the Mines Department, and two of the most
interested in the venture are Messrs. Joyce
and Colin Philp, the latter a son of the late
Robert Philp. Geologists give the district
a good fighting chance. It will be remem-
bered that the Grafton bore, in the bad old
days before we had begun to think in terms
of oil in Australia, gave off large quantities
of gas, the nature of which was never pro-
perly investigated. Grafton is probablv on
the same line of strata as Beaudesert. Were
those gas flows wet or dry?

Though the Westralian Mines Depart-
ment last year turned down Bremei- Bay oil
prospects, Perth Mayor Lathlain, heavily
interested, still has confidence in the show.
The area is owned by the South-Western

returned from eastern States with . Russian
oil-geologist De Hautpick, who is to examine
and report.

Australian Petroleum Development Co.
has given an option over all its leases in the
Northern Territory, also over O’Donnell’s
area (14,000 sq. miles in exti-eme north-
east of Westralia), to a group “which is pre-
paring to float a co. with a million shares
of 10s. to carry out prospecting and boring-
operations.” Flotation is being conducted
in Melbourne, but other States are to be
invited to become interested, and “it is anti-
cipated certain London interests will be
taking a considerable shareholding.”

Arthur Pearson’s office has decided to defer

“Talpa”: Another aspect of the Austra-
lian oil-hunt is the doubt as to the ability of
supervisors to : apply the correct methods to
be used in pi-ospecting. The expei’ience of
the U.S. Bureau of Mines shows that the
average American driller knows nothing about
the problem, and oil and gas sands subse-
quently giving large supplies have been
passed thx-ough and cased off in hundreds of
instances. Even -in Australia, at Roma, the
American driller reported “small gas pocket”
for a supply that, on bailing, showed a flow
of many millions of feet of gas per day. Thi?
excluding of water from producing wells, and
the proper plugging of abandoned wells, and
similar problems, are subjects for the engineer
rather than the driller, whose business it is
to drill the well, and nothing else. A great
responsibility rests with the Governments
concerned iii seeing that a national asset
is not irretrievably ruined by impitoper
methods.

Bendigo Amalgamated's record since, Teddy
Dyason floated the show has been as follows:
1918 ~ Loss .. £58,841
1919 7,784
1920 . . Profit .. 110,930
1921 . ! „ . . . 52,930
1922 .. Loss .. 17,561
The net l’esult has been a profit of £79,674.
In Dyason’s two fat years he was handling
the riches of the Constellation, and had the
Carlisle and Unity to help, besides which thp
high gold premium assisted. A year ago the
co.’s capital was reduced from £392,418- to
£303,808, £75,952 being returned to sub-
scribers. In connection with his profit-shar-
ing scheme, Dyason’s move now. is to put
two of the workers on the Board so. as to pro-
vide “a direct JLink between those directing
affairs and. the actual operatives.” Hard
times have brought a cut in staff salaries
as well as the departure of geologist Dr. Stil-
well.' With .the Constellation dope, the new
reefs in the Hercules and Monument mines
have beexi the centres of prospecting activity.
So far the pick hasn’t proved more than big-
unpayable quartz formations. But Dyason
still thinks there is plenty of room in the
claims for good shoots to be got. The policy
of conserving resources has been pursued. As
nothing fresh came along, old formations have
been woi-ked to the fullest extent. Ore milled
at 94,203 tons compares with 95,43 S tons in
the previous year, but the yield of 30,6310 z.
averages only 64dwt. against lOdwt. Costs
were much lower at 33.175. a ton —against
40.815. in 1921 —-but this in part was due
to curtailed development, which, after all,
only spells exhaustion of ore reserves. In
the balance-sheet, plant has been written
down to £143,700, and freeholds appear at
£11,414. Stocks on hand and other liquid
assets, including £21,917 of bonds, tot up
about £44,000. As outside debts are under
£l5OO the co.’s position continues snug. Still
the whole life of the co. has been a succes-
sion of blasted hopes.
* * * *
Blue Consolidated (Bendigo) half-yearly
report and balance-sheet to 31st July were
issued last week—a record for expedition,
surely! They are highly satisfactory docu-
ments. Directors state that “notwithstand-
ing the expenditure of a large amount in
connecting No. 3 shaft with the main shaft
workings, and thoroughly equipping the mine
with an efficient air service, rock-drills and
other necessaries, we were enabled to dis-
pense in dividends the sum of £15,750, equal
to 7s. per share.” During the six months
10,635 tons were crushed for 56730 z., an
average of 16dwt. Bgr. per ton. During the
past two months working costs have been
reduced from 30s. to 235. 4d. per ton. Re-
viewing the position the manager states that
results during the past few weeks have “fully
verified the prediction made at the commence-
ment of the term that the working improve-
ments mentioned would make the mine a
greater producer of profits than at any pre-
vious period, whilst the outlook for the future
is very bright and gives promise of being a
great profit-producer for a number of years.”
Returns for past fortnight fell off: there has
been less quartz in the part of the formation
which is being driven on south in the 1540 ft.
intermediate level, and material which recently
fell from the back of the level had to be re-
moved. The whole of this material will not
be disposed of for about another fortnight.
When the workings reached the stage for
systematic stoping up to 70ft. in width, an
average of from 10 to 12 dwt. per ton was
expected to be maintained for a long period.
This is still the opinion that is semi-officially
expressed. Instead of paying a div. last
week the directors decided to re-establish a
reserve fund, and to increase it to a five-figure
amount to provide for probable plant require-
ments and for extension of the scope of
operations.

Cathcart Victory, Ararat, is a typical
example of Victorian patience and enter-
prise in alluvial mining. For several years
the co. has been engaged iii a continuous
battle against water and heavy ground.
Bores have proved that the Cathcart lead
runs through the co.’s ground fox*' a consider-
able length, and when working difficulties
are mastered it ought to have a prosperous
run. Original capital of £54,000 —all sub-
scribed, there being no paid-up shares —has
been exhausted, and shareholders are to he
asked to sanction an increase of ss. per
share. In N. S. Wales, under its obsolete
law, this could not be done -without the old
co. going into liquidation, and the new one
would have to pay stamp duties on the book
value of the assets taken over, registration
fees and other charges, which would pro-
bably amount to about £5OO. Under the
Victorian law a no-liability mining, co. can
be registered at less cost than the charge
made in N. S. Wales for the certificate of
registration!

Philippine Di’edges, formed by John Mc-
Whae to work alluvial drift in Manila, has
got into Queer-sti-eet. Of the fleet of four
dredges that once swept in gold, one has
been dismantled since 1919, and No. 3 is
practically at the same stage. Hard times
also kept No. 4 idle last yeai\ When the
Board decided to give it a spin the sluice-
box supports were so rotten that the lot
smashed on to the deck. Then the tax-col-
lectoi’, in the person of Bi-other Jonathan,
made things so hot for the Aussies that it
became a toss-up whether to let that plant
also go into perpetual retirement. But chair-
man Anglxss still hopes to get the buckets
working. No. 2 plant put through 764,000
cub. yd. for 42020 z. gold. Since Nov. it
has added another 21550 z. But. finances are
sickly. The old debenture debt of £41,400
still stands, and accrued interest thereon is
now nearly £5OOO. Current debts amount
to £7274, and visible liquid assets in the
balance-sheet cover about only half that sum.
The co. also admits a debt of £BlB4 due to
the Paracale Dredging Co. for royalty, but
sets out a counter charge of £17,246. As the
Philippine holds 100,000 shares in the Para-
cale Co., it looks as if the debts on either
side are more or less partnership transac-
tions. For the gold won by the No. 2 dredge
the co. got £15,570, and’ made a working
pi-ofit of £5308, which melted down to £l4lB
when royalty and expenses were squared up.
So. the year’s run resulted in 'a loss of
£4032, which swells the debit of £34,642
already there. This and the debenture debt
suggest that John McWhae would have done
better had he stopped at home instead of
chasing the dollar in the land of little Brown
Brotlie#.
Westralian State mining-engineer Mont-
gomery expresses the opinion that there is
“room on the Westonia group of mines for
only one c 0.,” and that “the cos. at present
concerned ought to sink their differences
and combine their interests.” From early
in working of the field The Bulletin has
stressed that point, but the time is now past
when it can be said with certainty that a
joint pumping-scheme at Westonia would be
a profitable undertaking. While the mines
were working it was apparent that a joint

handling charges and also, enabled the three

are almost certain prospects of additional

No. 4 North Phoenix, Gympie (Q.), has
had another small crushing (120 ions) with
very decent values in it, and last week paid
out 2s. per share. That took the dividend
total to Bs. 6d., or £14,572 —all inside two
months, and from less than 350 tons- ore.
The last report shows that several of the
stopes have from 6 to 9 inches of stone show-
gold in the faces, but on the level
(784 ft.) the gold has gone out. The co.
can now afford to spend money in the hope
of locating it again. Recent crushings have
been the best paying for many a day on the
old field.

From a doctor who knew him: —-
Lord Northcliffe must have been a sick man when
he commenced his world tour (July, 1921 —March,
1922). It is strange that his medical advisers,
knowing that the inconveniences and worries of
travel would of a certainty have a prejudicial effect on
the progress of his complaint, did not veto the trip
altogether. They put him on a rigid diet, but that
was all. As he himself remarked, they deprived
him of everything in the food line that made life
worth living. When he went to the Rhine a few
weeks ago, incog., to judge for himself how the Ger-
mans were shaping economically—his suite con-
sisted of one companion, and his motor-car was a
hired one—some of the people w'hom he had met
in that country in 1914 remarked how thin he had
become. He said that it was small wonder
he had got thin, since the doctors had expressly
forbidden him to take any starchy foods, had vetoed
sugar and had banned from the menu all sweet
fruits. He had submitted to this regimen with a
good grace, but confessed that the deprivation of
all fluids at meal-time was a sore trial. By this he
obviously meant alcoholic fluids, since I cannot con-
ceive that any physicians, under the circumstances,
would deprive him of tea, coffee or mineral
waters. At all events, he was a teetotaller
in Australia. There is only one disease in
CHARLES CROSBY, octogenarian, Hobart
merchant and Plymouth Brother, who
recently started a church of his own.
which such sweeping changes in diet are neces-
sary, and that is glycosuria. I think it was
very rash of him after the termination of a long
and* arduous journey, when he must have known
that his symptoms had not abated or taken a
favorable turn, to rush away to Germany, but his
energy was apparently tireless and his love of
work unquenchable. The anxiety of dodging poten-
tially troublesome or even dangerous towns—
he made a detour of 153 kilos on approaching
Cologne—and the worries incidental to traversing
a country inimical to him, and the interests he
controlled, probably unsettled his nervous system
and caused the disease to take a change for the
worse. He talks about being upset by the
noise of motor-cars in Brussels, from which
city he precipitately fled; he would not have
noticed such slight inconveniences when in robust
health. Had one known the nature of the disease
he was so bravely fighting against, one would not
have been so astonished at the ominous news as to
his condition which was cabled a few days ago.
Middle-aged or elderly people who have been gross
feeders, or who have been subjected to a severe and
continuous mental anxiety and strain, sometimes
develop a temporary glycosuria. These patients, on
being dieted (all substances containing sugar being
barred) and put on small' doses of codeine, as a
rule, rapidly improve. I have lately seen two
patients suffering from glycosuria get well in a
month. It is quite a different thing when true
diabetes is established. The patient rapidly wastes,
and is apt to get serious, or even fatal, complica-
tions. Coma may set in, and end life in a few
hours. The prognosis in patients under 40 is grave,
but over that age the outlook is not quite so
gloomy, many sufferers having been known under
a rigid dietary to live in comparative health for
many years; but there is always the danger of some

serious complication supervening without warning.
I remember a diabetic who developed paralysis of
both legs, and lived for 18 months after the onset
of that awful complication. Some patients, in spite
of drug and dietetic treatment, go rapidly down
hill; and, unfortunately, diabetes is one of the
diseases about which medical science has still a
terrible lot to learn. There is no doubt that Lord
Northcliffe faced his ill-health with invincible reso-
lution and courage, and it is sad to reflect that a
most useful and energetic life has been so suddenly
brought to a close. He was a true Briton, and, like
Sir Thomas Browne, he was “In England everywhere,
and under any meridian.”
J. T. Lingen, K.C., has just celebrated
his golden jubilee as a barrister. He was

“Sr”: Prendergast, Victoria’s Labor

“T. 0.1.”: “Billy” Ross(B.10/8/’22) was not
born on the Red Rover, 106 years ago. There
were no births on that Vessel on that trip.
But he could have been born on a ship of
that name which arrived in Sydney on
August 13, 1832, with a couple of hundred
free women-immigrants. There were two
births on board during the voyage. Billy
Ross will be 90 this August, not 106.
Arthur Griffith, President of the Dail
Eireann, and father of the Sinn Fein move-
ment, died of heart failure last week. He
was a born rebel of the intellectual and
constructive type. The son of a Dublin
comp, he got a sound education from the
priests, and immediately started to better
it by hard reading. He was a republican
when his leaders—Parnell, the Redmonds.
Devlin —regarded the doctrine with con-
tempt. And whenever he saw an underdog
he barracked for the maltreated animal. This
brought him to the side of the Boers when
the last S’African war began, and, like
Lynch and many other insurgent Irishmen,
he fought with them against the Saxon
oppressor. In the years that followed he
did good propaganda work for Home Rule
in the British and U.S. press—he had a
most effective style and a tremendous fund
of political and historical knowledge to
draw on—and when the fighting began in
Ireland he, of course, plunged into the midst
of it. The English made a hero of him after
the settlement, as is their way, and he, no
doubt, deserved most of the encomiums
heaped on him by the press which had pre-
viously termed him a thug and an assassin.
Human freedom was the ideal he set before
himself during the whole of his crowded life,
and no fear or bribe was big enough to turn
him from what he sought.
“Jorrocks” writes of horsemen and others:
W. M. Hughes is the first Priminister of the Com-
monwealth who has been addicted to falling off
horses in his hours of leisure. It is difficult to
imagine Barton atop of a refractory prad or George
Reid bestriding any mustang except one of the
merry-go-round variety. Watson was probably a
better judge of a horse than any of his successors,
but insufficiently fond of the noble animal to
tear over the landscape on it before breakfast, and
there was nothing of the centaur about Deakin or
Andy Fisher or Joe Cook. Even William Morris
on horseback always suggests that he is riding less
for the abstract love of the thing than to shake his
liver up and wear a pair of riding-breeches. Wil-
liam’s passion for posing as a horseman (even at
the cost of an occasional tumble) recalls a harm-
less vanity of the Earl of Beaconsfield, whose delight
it was, when he lived at Hughenden, to dress himself
up as a John Bull agriculturist and take the chair at
Buckinghamshire farmers’ dinners. Dizzy, of course,
never looked like anything but a stage farmer, but
he may have felt like a real one. It is something
the same with Hughes’s equestrianism.
“Blackfriars” from London:—
Percy Hunter, now on his way back to Australia
to take up Harry Gullett’s relinquished immigration
job, made a bold bid for the title of “Australia's
best-dressed son” while here. Some, indeed, accorded
it to him, though tastes differ on this issue. Percy’s
tailoring is on the flamboyant side, thereby express-
ing vividly his interesting personality. His best
work for the Commonwealth is, and always will be,
done in the social arena. The sight of him, with
some rather dusty Federal magnate in tow, strolling
down Bond-street on a fine June afternoon —morn-
ing coat and trousers by Schultze, silk hat from
Scott’s, spats and patent-leathers straight out of the
Burlington Arcade, and an umbrella with the name
“Briggs” written all over it —this has been one of
the familiar sights of the last two London seasons;
and as the mere squatters, haberdashers and other
tourists from the Commonwealth watched him
easily greeting duchesses and the like, they agreed
that he was earning all his screw. The discredit-
able-looking politician who was almost invariably
with Percy merely served to show up the latter’s
almost unearthly radiance. Percy, W. M. Hughes
and Joe Cook all learned to dress (or as some
carpers will insist on having it) overdress in Lon-
don. George Reid continued to look like one who
had spent the night on an ashheap to the end.
“Lex”: Robert Darlow Pring, of the N. S.
Wales Supreme Court, who died on Sunday
-after a long illness, just missed being a big
figure on the Bench. He had courage, force,.
and was a sound lawyer; but he lacked
breadth and intellectuality. He was a nar-
row man and hard. Wholly upright himself,
he had no understanding of laxness in others:
his maimer was bad, and there were times
when his manners were little better. The
Bar did not like him as they like Gordon
and Ferguson; but they respected him
as a man who knew his job, was com-
pletely devoid of pose, and was as straight as
a gun-barrel in every relation in life. He
was just on 70 when the end came. He
married a direct descendant of Gidley King,
sometime Governor of N. S. Wales, and is
survived by three sons and a daughter.
About an eminent family:—
Mary Elizabeth Gaunt, who died in England a few
days ago, was the widow of William Henry Gaunt,
a gold commissioner, and, later, a Victorian County
Court Judge. She had five sons and two daughters.
Sir Guy Gaunt, was naval attache at Washing-
ton and head of the British Secret Service in America
during the war; Vice-Admiral Sir Ernest Gaunt
commands a division of the British Battle fleet,
and a third son enlisted in a Hussar regiment and
wound up as Colonel (D. 5.0.) of the 4th D.G.’s.
The other two are successful barristers in Rangoon
and Singapore respectively. Of the girls Mary is
the novelist and traveller. The other settled in
Malay States, but on the death of her husband re-
turned to Melbourne and established a hostel for
University students. Mary Gaunt boasts that none
of them began with either money or influence.
One of the most mysterious citizens in
N. S. Wales is the gentleman whom the
Assembly knows as “Lloyd George.” Every
day and night, while the House is in session,
he sits in the Speaker’s Gallery, and whether
the sitting is of tie briefest or an all-night
affair, he hangs on to the bitter end. Jokes
of the most uproarious nature fail to raise a
smile from him; larrikinism, however de-
based, does not move him to a frown. The
other night, one of the Mother State’s best-
known statesmen was counting heads for his'
party. Being more than a little sozzled, he
counted his colleagues; then the Sergeant-
at-Arms, then the Chauffeurs (who, while
waiting to take members home, were improv-
ing their intellects by listening to the speechi-
fying from the public gallery), and finally
he counted “Lloyd George.” The bizarre
distinction would have moved some men. But
the stranger maintained his unearthly aloof-
ness to the end. In the matter of unearthly
aloofness, no less than in his odd means
of finding amusement, all hands from Speaker
Levy_ down to the braided menial who guards
K? - Precincts of the Chamber, agree
that he is unique.
“Invalid”: “Gnarek’s” par (B. 22/6/’22)
revives the old suggestion about Horatio
Bottomley being a son of Charles Bradlaugh.
This appeared in the July number of the
London Literary Guide : “There is not a
scintilla of truth in the allegation that Mr.
Horatio Bottomley is an illegitimate son of
Charles Bradlaugh. As a matter of fact,
Bi adlaugh did not know even of the exist-
ence of Bottomley’s mother.”
H. KNEEBONE, editor Adelaide HERALD.
A note concerning the late Lord North-
cliffe, written in London just before the last
mail left: —•
Northcliffe seems to have been suffering, of late,
from fits of mental instability. His pamphlet vio-
lently attacking other newspaper proprietors and the
extravagantly-worded advertisements to promote its
circulation point clearly in that direction. Further
corroboration is afforded by his playing Aunt Sally
with a couple of his fellow-directors of the Daily
Mail and associated newspapers, who have both issued
writs for libel against him. Other reports allege
that he recently promulgated some strange orders,
such as that no two brothers should remain in his
employ, and that no member of his staff should deal
in both journalism and fiction. In consequence of
this latter decree G. Valentine Williams, the foreign
editor of the Daily Mail, who is also a successful
novelist in his spare moments, has resigned. Wil-
liams, by the way, married beautiful Alice Crawford,
of Bendigo.
An impression:—
Most big men carry a sort of aura which marks
them for what tney are on sight. Cases in my
experience are Kitchener, Foci), Cardinal Manning,
Winston Churchill, and our own freak-Napoleon,
Hughes. Northcliffe lacked it. A shortish, fattish,
loose sort of man, without a solitary remarkable
feature, he would have looked quite in place behind
a counter, or driving a tram, or going slow on a
road-maintenance job, or performing any other
humble duty. When he spoke he employed a thin
head-voice something reminiscent of the young Lon-
don “blood” of vaudeville; and he rather featured
that simplicity, verging on fatuity, which is the
rule in social circles where fools predominate, and
manners demand that the conversation shall not
soar above the level of the dullest person present.
And yet there was something about him, despite his
silken ways, that suggested tremendously unpleasant
possibilities. The stout Count in Wilkie Collins’s
“The Woman in White” was the fictional character
that he somehow made me think of every time I
saw him. Which only shows how a surface impres-
sion of a man’s personality may err, for Northcliffe
was not that sort of man, whatever else he may
have been.
“F.L.H.”: A soldier who had done the
State some service was the Gurkha, Frederick
Singha, who passed out at Melbourne Hospi-
tal a day or two ago. Picked up at Ceylon,
when a lad, by Theodore Fink, he usually
worked as a cook, hut proved his fighting
qualities in the Boer War and the recent
bigger affair. In one daring exploit he knifed
three German snipers and won a sergeants
stripes. He lost two brcfthers in the war.
“A.M.F.”: By the compulsory retirement
of Generals Legge and Fqrsyth, Australia’s
Citizen Army has received one of the greatest
set-backs since the inauguration of the uni-
versal Training Scheme, for which they were
chiefly responsible. Legge is an organising
genius and an S.O. of the highest order. I or-
svth is less brilliant intellectually, but
more likeable. The Light Horse in particu-
lar swear by him. He raised, trained and
handed them over to Chauvel in Egypt, and
although all the kudos went to Chauvel, a lot
of it was due to the foundations laid by For-
syth. He was chosen for his sound, prac-
tical judgment to straighten out the mess
into which the Supplies Branch had drifted,
and this he was doing very successfully
when the end came.

restore Axham to the 'Register of Practi-

with no response. Dr. Axham’s desire

“Clifford S.”: A certain difficulty, occa-
sionally noticed by the oafish Sassenach, in
dealing with the melodious tongue of Old
Ireland, is illustrated by the publication in
the new Statesman’s Year Book of an
authentic list of Erin’s Free State Cabinet.
Its members are
Michael O’Coileain, Eamon O’Dugain, Caoimbghin
O’Huigin, Seosamh Mag Crait, Padraig O’Hogain,
Fionan O’Loingsigh, Liam T. Madbosgair, Diarmuid
O’Hegarty, Gavan Duffy, 3. 3. Walsh.
And the Irish signatories of the treaty which
created the Free State were:—■
Art O’Griobhtha, Micheal O’Coileain, Riobard
Barton, E. S. O’Dugain, Sforsa Ghabhain, Ui
Dhubbthaigli.
This is the Irish language, which is the only
official language of the Free State. Out of
every 10,000 inhabitants 39 speak it exclu-
sively. Another 1200 s,peak it, either well or
badly, in conjunction with English. The
remaining 8671 speak English only. Welsh
has proved a much more durable language
than Irish, for no visible reason. Out of
10,000 inhabitants of the Ap-Synfrmaed-
tywith country, 790 speak their own
curlycue speech and hone other, while
another 3250 speak it and English
indifferently. All Irish official documents
addressed to the Sassenach Government in
London are headed “Translation,” but
whether Caoimbghin O’Huigin ever put them
into his own national language is doubted.
Bbth Irish and Welsh seem inadequate lan-
guages for one who aspires to think more or
less modern thoughts. They do not appear
to produce Miltons, unless of the incurably
mute, inglorious sort; and if anyone has
painted or sculped or composed music on the
classical scale In the Gaelic he has been
successfully hidden from the envious eye
of the English-speaking oppressor.

“Eddyson” : It happened at Clunes in the
bad old days, when Sop Suey kept a fruit
and vegetable shop at, the end of the main
street, down near the creek. Sop wanted a
wife, and thought Glenning’s missus would
fill the bill. She neither drank, drugged nor
smoked; was industrious, and not too old,
The fact that Mrs. Glenning maintained Mr.
Glenning by the sweat of her brow, shed over
a hot tub, was a grave consideration; it
might impel Mr. G.' to put a. high price on
his property. However, Sop Suey was
severely smitten, and out to win at any rea-
sonable price. His first offer took a form
that he imagined would be most acceptable
to Glenning—£2s down and a barrel of beer.
The barrel of beer was avail-
able for inspection at the
Rose Hotel, and after walk-
ing round it five times Mr.
Glenning seemed on the
point of accepting, when
the lady concerned, who
was washing at the pub. in-
tervened. A week later Sop
offered £3O. Mr. Glenning
mentioned £5O as the price
he put on the best wife man
ever had. Sop Suey pro-
tested, whereupon Glenning
spent a full hour enumerat-
ing the lady’s virtues. Event-
ually the Confucian paid
the sum stipulated and took
possession of the lady. Some
good clothes and a careful
coiffure improved her charms
immensely, and Suey put
her in charge of his new
soda fountain. There was
only one discontented party,
and that was Glenning. He
was continually intruding,
uttering bitter reproaches,
and making unreasonable
claims, and several times,
Sop Suey was seen running
the recent husband of Mrs.
Sop Suey off the premises,
and into the adjacent drain.
Sop’s neighbors were shocked
at Glenning’s immoral con-
duct. Glenning was expos-
tulated with. It was pointed
out that his demand for
restitution was contrary to
strict notions of propriety;
moreover, it was unbusi-
nesslike? “You sold out; you
got your 50 quid,” said .Tack Taunton, as expo-
nent of the public sentiment of the town,
“you ought to be satisfied.” “Did I get my 50
auid!” cried Glenning. “I got nothin’ of the
kind. I’m dam’ well ashamed of the price
I got fer me wife’s honor* She took the 50,
and on’.v allowed me a paltry 10 per cent, fer
negotiatin’ the sale.”
“Griffith Moses” : It seems to roe that the
principal objections to the stupidly vulgar or
vulgarly stupid idea of calling the Tasman
the Arfzac Sea are these- sir: The Gallipoli
stunt wasn’t a large affair after all; it was
a failure. It didn’t affect the course for
the better as some failures do. We weren’t
the only people there by a long way, nor was
MISUNDERSTOOD.
“And how are we to-day, my girl?”
“Not too good.”
“Excuse me. I teas inquiring after your health, not your behavior”
it our special concern, like the Papuan busi-
ness and some others. We don’t own the
Tasman Sea beyond the three-mile limit.
And we didn’t discover it,' so the privilege of
naming international property which is
allowed to discoverers doesn’t come in, as in
such cases as Behring Sea and Hudson’s Bay.
Still less did the Australian and New Zea-
land Army Corps discover it. Anyhow,
there is an objection to composite names.
When Alderman Jenkins and Alderman
Littlejohn exert their joint pull and get the

selves the result pleases no one. Lidcombe

ing in the ceiling till the coast was clear.
He got away in the prison-governor’s clothes
to S.A., was almost at once gaoled there for
larceny, and in October escaped, giving the
police a fine moving-picture kind of chase
on a motor-cycle and, when overtaken, on
foot across country. The Stockade at Dry
Creek has since held him, but t’other day
he disappeared, legirons and all, when work-
ing in the quarry. The S.O.S. call was sent
out, and for four hours police, trackers and
warders hunted for the elusive William. More
. by luck than anything else he was finally
found in a tunnel in the bed of a creek. He
had literally gone to ground, and he was
nearly smothered when found. Incidentally,
this slippery kind of customer is always the
reverse of popular with his. fellow-prisoners.
His exploits mean the withdrawal of the
privileges which every decent gaoler likes
to grant.

“O.K.’s” view of it:—
Penleigh Boyd quits Melbourne for England next
week on an artist-showman’s mission. His scheme is
to collect all sorts of pictures for exhibition in Aus-
tralia, paintings from every modern school of arr,
sane and cranky, in order that his fellows of the
brush may know what is doing whilst philistine?
are shocked in their sense of reasonableness. Yorti-
eists, Cubists and Futurists are to have their show
along with painters whose purpose in life is to sell
their goods, not to shock non-buyers. The project
sounds promising enough, and the novelty of its side-
lines may give it bold advertisement. There have
been touring- picture-shows in the past, but the paint-
ings—respectable, risky or oddly pretentious—were
all of them comprehensible. None of them sough:
notoriety by Inviting scowls and guffaws. Artful
absurdities may do the gate-money trick. All the
same, It is rather staggering to be told that “In
seeking examples of Vortieism, Mr. Boyd hopes thjt
by viewing these extreme absurdities of Old World
art the public will achieve a sense of proportion, a
feeling of sanity In art.” As a clever painter him-
Self Boyd views the matter from a professional’s
standpoint, and attaches false importance to i.he
Vortieists, Cubists, Futurists, Da-Daists, etc. He
thinks he detects sincerity in work where the world
sees only bluff, stuff and nonsense. He surmises a mea-
sure, if only an infinitesimal measure, of lasting re-
sult, whereas commonsense takes the ultimate complete
oblivion of these “new schools’’ for granted. To
people who consider that the Old Master? have lived
for centuries oh the absolute sanity of their work it
seems waste of thought to' discuss the ravings of in-
sanity, real or assumed. Nothing appears more ridi
culous than crude lunatics in art or poetry, except
the eloquent eulogiums-lavished on them by critics
whose specialty is the discovery of sublime beauties
that remain hidden to ordinary intelligence. It is
the educated public’s very sense of proportion which
refuses to be interested in glaring absurdities. And
in that sense of proportion many capable craftsmen
in art and literature are lacking. Otherwise the
Bluff, Stuff and Nonsense schools could have no birth
and childhood. Old age they never attain.
A WARM-WEATHER JOB.
“ Aren't there times when yon wish you had
hesitated before becoming an artist’s

“Well. I do sometimes wish I had hesitated

WHERE ARE THE COPS?
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The N. 8. Wales Chief Secretary complains of the
difficulty of getting efficient police recruits at the
presect rates of pay. “The days of fine, hefty men,
who P4,n hold their own with the roughs, seem to
have gone,” says Mr. Qalces.
Through Surry Hills at set of sun
Forbidding figures skulk and scoot
O’er prostrate limbs the rule is run,
Slips into quivering frames the boot.
The thugs are on the job, ’tis clear —
Where are the cops of yesteryear?
Where are the stalwart men in blue
Patrolling Argus-eyed their beats
To awe anarchic Waterloo
And keep the peace on Pyrmont streets?
The force before whose truncheons ran
The toughest Newtown hooligan.
Easy to them as shelling peas
To pounce upon the burliest tug,
The most accomplished crook to seize
And haul him, darbied, to the jug,
Quelling, lone-handed, berserk frays—
Where are the Johns of other days?
They weakened not in Woolloomooloo,
In Ultiqio they never quailed
Though pickets crashed and bottles flew
And jagged metal round them hailed.
Where are they now, do you suppose?
With Kosciusko’s last year’s snows?
Aye; they are gonel With Mr. Oakes
The tear we shed and share the moan ;
Oh 1 for the husky, hefty blokes
Who .held with snarling mobs their own
And kept in Sydney streets the Law
A thing of majesty and awe.
Where are the men who shirked no stress
(Nor needed to) with Dempsey’s thews,
Foch’s serene resourcefulness,
The versatility of Hughes?
AVhy do we seek them vainly? Eh?
Is it inadequate, the pay,
A whole fourteen-and-six a day?

“Ex-Englishman”: Birth-restriction finds
au unexpected and powerful advocate in
Dean Inge, who carries more intellectual ton-
nage probably than any Anglican preacher in
England. In his recent Rede Lecture at
Cambridge on the Queen Victoria epoch, he
< harges it against the economists of that day
that “their only error was failure to realise
'that over-population is the result of a very
low standard of civilisation. Families are
restricted whenever the parents have social
ambitions and a standard of comfort. Where
they have none, the vital statistics are those
of Russia, Ireland, India and China.” And
he cites the horrible case of a predecessor of
his own, Dean Colet, who was one of 22 chil-
dren, and the only one of the lot who lived
to grow up.

*“Exul”: Mob psychology is a weird thing.
I was walking along Castlereagh-street, Syd-
ney, one night. Near Park-street, on the
eastern footpath, near the gutter, a man
stood inoffensively gazing into space. An-
other man approached from Market-street,
and, for no discernible reason, punched the
IN MEMORIAM.
"I particularly likr this dress: it's rich, yet at the same
time simple .”
“Of course, dear! A kind of permanent reminder of your
husband.”
abstracted one in the jaw, knocking him
down. The smiter then dashed across to the
other footpath, narrowly escaping being
knocked down bv a tram, and doubled back
in his tracks. His action had been seen by
three sailors, who had just come round the
corner in line-ahead formation. The first
put out his foot and the fugitive tripped on
it, cannoning off a wall in such a manner as
to stop with his nose the fist of the second
sailor. Some civilians got to the sailors.
Then some soldiers hurried up to the aid of
the senior service. More civilians chipped
in on both sides, and in less than three min-
utes there was a fighting mob of at least 150
men. It took a vanload of police to stop
the scrap. I never learned how many of the
combatants knew what it was all about.
PERFECTLY FALSE.

SHE: “Why, they’re artificial!”

“De Oriel”: N. Queensland country towns
are becoming so cosmopolitan that touring
showmen sometimes advertise in what looks
likely to be the dominant language. Whilst
playing North Queensland some time ago we
had couriers printed in Chinese for the
Tolga residents, and matter done in Italian
for the Dago town of Halifax. Unfortunately,
the fool-post officials, in examining the bills,
transposed the parcels. Upon arrival _at
Halifax we found Gabriel d Annunzio s
countrymen furious at being approached in
Cliow language, whilst the Pongs ot Tolga
persisted in regarding the Dago dodgers as
the efforts of misguided proselytising mis-
sionaries.
« * * *
“Yardley”: A man I know served his
apprenticeship in Edinburgh, and was reck-
oned by his mates there a clever workman,
to whom nothing in his line came amiss.
Hence the assurance with which he sought
employment in Birmingham, the very strong-
hold of his trade. That assurance, however,
soon crumbled before a necklace of negatives.
Nobody wanted him, and eventually he
learned why. “It’s no use looking; tor a
lathe as a brass-turner here,” one of the
employees said. "Before entering an office
read the sign outside, and then ask for a
job at that particular
specialty.” The Scotch-
man took the tip. The first
factory he tried next, morn-
ing was specialising in cas-
tors for furniture. He en-
tered with the inquiry:
“Any show for a castor-
turner?” The instant an-
swer was: “Go down and
see the foreman.” Thence-
forth, throughout a long re-
sidence in Birmingham, this
man never again found diffi-
culty in obtaining employ-
ment. In each instance he
found himself an outsider
amongst the specialists, but
he always managed to earn
board-money whilst catching
up with ’ his shopmates.
Now, there is a lesson in
this for Australia. At pre-
sent, in most of our fac-
tories, the stage of progres-
sion calls for men who are
competent for any depart-
ment of their trade; but bow
will those competents fare
when extension of the fac-
tory brings them . into com-
petition with specialists who
have devoted their lives to
a mere detail of the work?
The man who confines his
labor exclusively to gun-
action-filing has wasted, all
the time which he may have spent whilst
working at any other part of a. £tm. l lns
question of learning a whole trade, or only
a part of a trade, well merits discuss-on
between representatives of employers and of
workers. If our lads are to lift Australia
to prominence amongst the nations, appren-
tices cannot afford to lose any tune m
acquirement of that which will be useless
to them.
“Billy T.”: Mrs. Smiley believed she was
safe in trusting her little Bobbie (aged two)
to his sisters and brothers, of whom there
v ere four—aged 6. S, 10 and 12. They
lived beside the railway line, a mile or two
outside Bealiba, on the way to St. Arnaud
(Vic.), and the children had never
been unsettled morally, even to the
extent of seeing- a cinema-show. Sud-
denly the storm broke, and there was
Hades to play and the Devil to pay.
The Smiley children had held up the mid-
day train, and attempted to rob it with two
mutton-bone pistols loaded with Chinese
crackers, and one old broken shotgun, the
property of Smiley, senior. “But,” protested
Mrs. Smiley, “what did you stop for? Fancy
stopping the train for a few kids! You
shouldmt have been such a fool as to stop.”
“I think,” said the driver, “you will admit
we did right in stopping.’* “Never! You
shouldn't have stopped. Why—why”
“We stopped for a dam’ good reason,” in-
terrupted the guard. “They had your baby
tied to the railway-line.”
“Nimshi”: Exultation over a deceased
enemy isn’t entirely confined to Oriental
races. In the hospital of a
Queensland town, some time
since, there was an old man
who, whenever he was
allowed out, headed straight
for the local cemetery.
These frequent pilgrimages
became a subject of mild
curiosity, for the ancient
was a comparative stranger
to the district, and, as far
as was known, there were
no sentimental ties to draw
him to the resting-place of
the hamlet’s rude fore-
fathers. At last it was de-
cided to try and solve the
mystery, and two inouisitive
persons followed in the wan-
derer’s tracks. They were
witnesses of a curious scene.
The old chap made his way
to a particular grave,
mounted upon it, and began
a kind of war-dance, flinging
his arms and legs about in
ecstatic abandon. The ritual
went on for about 10
minutes, and seemed to re-
lieve the demonstrator’s feel-
ings, for a hapny smile re-
placed his habitual gloomy
demeanor. After he had
meandered off, the watchers,
more curious than ever, proceeded to ascer-
tain who it was that had been the object of
these posthumous attentions. The grave
proved to be that of the local police ser-
geant.

“Hanno” considers prohibition and hos-
pitals :
Recently a number of medical men in Melbourne
collected some statistical figures bearing on the rela-
tionship of drink to the cases treated at the three
metropolitan hospitals, Melbourne, St. Vincent’s and
Alfred. The result in no way supports the pro-
hibitionist claim that suppression of the sale of drink
leads to decrease in the cost of maintenance of hos-
pitals and similar institutions. As far as casualty-
room cases are concerned, omitting the comparatively
trivial matters, only one in 468 was directly traceable
to drunkenness at the time of accident. Of 217
patients in the medical wards one only was found to
be suffering from disease directly produced by liquor. In
the surgical wards the percentage was even lower,
and in the female cases on both sides it was lower
still. As far as the incidence of disease goes it is
much the same in America as it is in Australia,
with the exception of certain industrial and occupa-
tional complaints ; and yet Australian supporters of
the Pussyfoot business never tire of repeating that
many American hospitals have been closed because
there are no patients for them. As a matter of plain
fact, a reputable American medical publication, the
Massachusetts Joubnal op Clinical Medicine,
stated recently that, as far as it was aware, there
was not a single hospital, asylum or gaol anywhere
in the United States that had been closed since
prohibition arrived, purely as a result of; prohibi-
tion.
“H.F.” : Among the many unforeseen con-
sequences of the Great War is the disappear-
ance of Britain s landed aristocracy, wlucn is
assuredly going the way of the vanished king-
lets and princelings of Central Europe, in
England post-war taxation has broken all
records, and on large estates it is confisca-
tory. Itider Haggard, a squire of. broad
acres, moans: “Do the peoplVof this country
understand that, owing to swollen outgoings
and the cost of upkeep, few, if any, landed
properties pay their way.” During the four
years 11117-20, estates equal to five average-
sized English counties changed hands, mostly
by subdividing sale to the occupying farmers
at prices from 10s. to £lOO per acre. Castles
and mansions are largely unsaleable, but
their upkeep from rents is impossible. When
the possessor does not go into trade, he is
often glad to camp in a cottage on his estnte.
In three generations, by the operation of
fixed charges and death duties, the old landed
aristocracy will be extinct. In this way the
backbone of nine-tenths of England’s -fiction
and drama —the lord and his lady and the
squire and his humble tenants —is fading
into oblivion. Jews and profiteers will, no
doubt, fill the vacuum efficiently ; but it will
not, cannot, be quite the same.

“Flicker,” his carp :
“liilang” calls attention (B. 27/7/’22) to school-
books that encourage South Australian kids to murder
their own language. But what of some of tire alleged
literature prescribed for the Senior Public Univer-
sity Exam, in the same State? Those sitting for the
senior standard are presumably of an age to appre-
ciate good verse ; and assuredly the average Austra-
lian is fond of it. But in the book issued
to Adelaide Uni., “The Golden Book of English
Verse” (by a person named Jones), there is little to
give pleasure to the student but much to give pain
to a person with a musical ear. For instance, in
one little gem by Cory concerning a sea-fight, we
have the following:
George gave him ins commission, and that it might
be safer
Signed “King of England, King of France,” and
sealed it with a wafer.
Simplicity may be needed for the beginner, hut in-
harmonious fatuity is not; and if simplicity is re-
quired there is any amount of good verse by Austra-
lians. Even if we are to stick to the theory , that a

“Shall we dance this one ?”
“That wasn’t the music starting. One of the waiters

poet is no good till he is dead, our own literature
can still fill the bill. The home-grown youth is not
going to be wildly thrilled by an account of the
coming of Spring which is set to a metre about as
musical as the arrival of a goods-train, and. which
deals with a Spring-time he has never seen. But
Kendall has set the very spirit of our own Spring
in hiu, “Grey Winter has gone like a wearisome
guest,” etc. The Lord send that such wearisome
visitors as Jones’s manual will also soon take their
departure from our ’Varsities, where they do
nothing to the literary taste of our young men but
vitiate it. #
“Tasmaniac”: The recent completion of
the Stanley-Myalla railway in the Speck has
upheld that island’s reputation for hastening
slowly. It is 168 miles long, find the first
sod was turned by the Duke of Edinbuig
in 1868. A fraction over three miles a
vear is not what one could call rushing the
job; but, after all. it is better than some of
the mainland shows, one or two or wincn,
and notably the North-South railway, look
like never being finished at all.
MELBOURNE IN AUGUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the sodden month when chimneys loom
Like dripping trees against a watery sky,
And crowded trams slug homeward through the gloom
With muffled toilers striving to keep dry.
In vain they try 1
The gutters with a yellow fluid gush,
And all the suburbs are a-wash with slush.
Men dress themselves like Polar bears and growl
Because the price of fuel has increased,
And women past the lighted shop-fronts prowl,
Seeking the skin of some small, furry beast
Long since deceased
That they may shelter from the bitter cold,
As did the shivering caveman’s wife of old.
Now is the time that furtive bacilli
Lurk in damp corners for their destined prey,
Strong, sturdy men in quaking fevers lie,
And children get their tonsils cut away.
To keep at bay
The dreaded wolf, Father to business goes
With aching bones and teardrops on his nose.
And, as the gloomy shades of night advance,
In crowded cinemas men sit and freeze
While feeding on some sugary romance
Cooked in the kitchens of Los Angeles:
With cough and sneeze
They punctuate each great, red-blooded scene
That flicks its fiery way across the screen
“In sport there lies forgetfulness,” say some,
And troop in thousands to the football ground
Where guernseyed youths, amid a savage hum,
Chase an inflated sphere of leather round.
A roar of sound
Splits the dank air when one team scores a win
And cops swarm out to bring the umpire ini
Season of mists.... But ah, how well we know
The fight with asthma breeds a virile racel
That white men only thrive in mud and snow,
And wilt like ices in a warmer place!
Here, by God’s grace,
Let us remain, and prove with tongue and pen
The North was only meant for colored men.

“Randolpli Rentless”: The Australian
drover is a casual and resourceful cuss. Richard
Mahoney, having taken the job of droving a hog-fat
stud bull from Hay (N.S.W.) to Boondara station —
refused by other drovers because the pampered beast
A MATTER OF TASTE.
BOTH (not to rare) : “Some mothers have queer children!”
would have to be walked—hitched the animal behind
his dray, and set off ; but, at a rest-interval the bull
got away, swam a river, and joined some other
cattle. Mahoney, pursuing the escapee,, had his horse
drowned in the river, and was left with the bull and
a horseless dray on his hands. He arrived at his
destination with an outraged lord of the cow-yard
snorting at the indignity of being harnessed between
the shafts of a cart.
■X ■* * *
“Wessel”: Harry Burrell, of Manilla
(N.S.W.) or thereabouts, has a photograph of a
pelican in a queer fix. By some means, Lord knows
how, the bird had at some time or other got the
upper half of his bill stuck through the skin of the
pouch under the lower half. The two halves of the
bill are practically tied together about midway to
the end. The pelican could not open his mouth in
the ordinary way, and he could feel only by taking
in its tucker sideways near the base of the bill. Yet
he must have rubbed along like this for quite a long
time.
“Heclce”: Some time ago a prospecting
mate and I were having “crib” on Snake Creek —a
small stream running into the Combienbar (Vic.) —
when a large black snake crawled up to a damp >og
and commenced to make a meal off the
mushroom-like fungi that grew upon it. He
devoured at least 20 of them. I have always
believed they are deadly poison. A hurried consul-
tation decided us not to kill but disable him, and
test whether he had quarrelled with his missus and
was committing suicide. But as he became none
the worse for his feast an hour later we ended his
misery. Does the snake generate his blood poison
from a stomach poison?
• * * •
“C.L.N.”: The more I watch cattle that
have left good pasture for priekly-pear the more am I
inclined to liken them to the boozer. They begin
their downward slide by nipping off the choice green
leaves and shoots of the pear, and appear to be none
the worse for it; but, somehow, their sense of taste
becomes perverted, and they disert the choice buds
for the uninviting, dried corky pear. It is here that
they become the outcasts of society. They live for
pear, and pear alone. And it generally ends up the
one way—the indigestible dried stuff causes impac-
tion, and the animals’ doom is sealed. I can’t say
if any of ’em take the pledge before reaching the
last stage. Can some Abo. pear-expert enlighten me?
* * • *
“Ned Kelly”: My Rolls Ford suddenly
went on strike the other day outside Coonamble
(N.S.W.), and as I was sprawled out underneath
her a mounted constable rode by with lordly air
taking no notice of me. Then just as he had passed
an old swaggie, travelling in the opposite direction,
came up. He stopped and looked at the car for
a few minutes, as if he were intensely interested;
then, when the trooper was well away, he spoke:
“Yer can come out now, mate; ’e never seen yer.”
* * * *
“Merah”: “Bull’s Wool” (B. 20/7/’22)
evidently knows little of Australian edible animals.
The wombat smells no higher than a kangaroo, and
it would be a particularly fastidious bushman who
would turn away from a haunch of ’roo when pro-
perly cured and cooked. The mange that “Bull’s
Wool” speaks of may be a purely local complaint,
or, perhaps a judgment on the poor beasts for
living in the Upper Yarra (Vic.) district. He is
also wrong in saying the hides will not tan. I
have seen dozens of them treated with strong
wattle-bark solution and used for doormats and
footmats in buggies and sulkies.
» * * *
“Kimt”: I don’t know how to keep bull-
frogs, but tell “C. Coral” (B.
20/7/’22) here’s <1 quick and sure
way to slay the cockroaches on
his lugger. (I know because I
have cleaned them out of many
schooners in the Islands.) Mix
arsenic with treacle into a thick
paste, and put it into a few tins
—empty herring-tins for prefer-
ence—and sprinkle with flour.
Lay a tin in the cabin, another
in the hold and perhaps one in
the fo’c’s’le, and the cockroaches
will head for them about six
deep. You’ve only got to renew
it a couple of times before all
the ’roaches turn up their toes
regardless of how many there may
be aboard the hooker. But if you
have any coons aboard that are
any way useful don’t let ’em use
the empties for pannikins.
* •
“Te W.”: I have recently
seen a valuable bull die from
bot-fly. The stomach was found
to be lined with the long, rat-
tailed maggots w'hich are the
larvae of this atrocious insect,
each hanging on to the mucous
membrane by a hook at the head
end. These larva? also turn up
at times in outhouses and open
tree-hollows. I have found the
scarlet rag often hung around
horses’ necks to scare bot-fly
quite ineffective, the bee-like in-
sec: striking and depositing its
tiny w-hite eggs among the ani-
mal’s hairs in spite of it. A mix-
ture of kerosene and “sweet oil”
rubbed over the eggs will render
them infertile. The lousy star-
ling is credited with the destruc-
tion of many bot-flies and their
larvae; but the insects flourish nevertheless. Some
strange inherited instinct teaches horses that the
bot-fly is dangerous to them, and they rush madly
away when they notice one. But the creature
deposits its eggs with extraordinary rapidity and
rarely misses.
* < • •
“Sir Spen”: The feat of locating a rifle-
man’s shots on the target before it turns, as related
by “Pine-needle” (B. 27/7/-’22) is not extraordinary.
It depends largely on the humidity of the air. The
hot bullet coming in contact with the moisture in
the air causes a slight vaporisation that is visible
to a keen sight for several hundreds of yards. Once
at Randwiek (N.S.W.) range a friend and I stood
behind sundry competitors in the service matches
(10 shots at a figure exposed for 40 seconds), and
held a series of competitions between ourselves by

us was very far wrong at any time.
“Iola”: “Cartot” (B. 22/6/’22) insists
that one Bill, an Aussie bird-of-paradise hunter,
carried for 100 miles through the Eitape country
(Papua) a sick man weighing 1191 b., and assures

hadn’t heard it until “Cartot” told it; nor had I
heard of the fracas with Klaiuss, though I was
nearer the border than Buna Bay at the time “Car-
tot” says it happened. Will he, or anyone else who
feels inclined to back the -Dill myth, answer the
following questions?—Who Parted the yarn? How
long did it take Bill to carry that sick man 100
miles? What grub was eaten by them during that
time, and by whom was it canned? Were any local
natives requisitioned for carrying, and if not why
not? How were the swamps and waterways negoti-
ated bv a heavy man carrying another 1191 b. in
weight? What grip did the perspiring William
employ to keep the very sick man on his back?
How came a bird-of-paradise hunter and a scientist
each, separately, to be in the interior of New Guinea
without the carriers and equipment indispensable to
New Guinea travel ?

Cowra (N.S.W.), we have a dog that is absolutely
dumb. Exhaustive tests by torture (mild), fright,
excitement etc., have failed to bring the slightest

superior to those of any ordinary towser. He is
just plain dog, and hunts with the station pack.

“Caballer” : Is there anything down south
quite like the white-
tailed rat of the Atherton
Tableland (N.T.) ? In
winter-time one of them
the size of a three-parts-
grown rabbit will carry
off and bite into a tin
of condensed milk, and
after a few hours’ prac-
tice will knock the lid
off a large camp-oven and
bog into your loaf as if
it were a counter-lunch.
They are noisy devils,
always clicking their teeth
and making a grunting
sound as they roam about
the camp. I have put a
.22 bullet through one’s
hindquarters, and seen him
back in three minutes to
flour spilt outside the tent.
They tock my mate’s pipe
once, and he found it a
week later on a stump,
bitten through the stem.
On the morning of the loss
he had also mislaid his tobacco, and until he
found it he falsely accused the white-tails of this.
I could hear him as he searched. “I’ve kept the
blankards in tucker for a month —if they’re going
to start smoking I’m through.’’

“FY7”: “Pro” (B. 20/7/’22) asks how
extinct vertebrates like the diprotoddn came to leave
their bones in massed formation in such “bone
beds” as those at Quirindi (N.S.W.), and quotes a
Canadian professor’s theory that herd animals have
community dying grounds. If “Pro” has ever seen
a big, dried-up lagoon or waterhole towards the
end of a long drought in the West, the true-inward-
ness of the “bone beds” should have been borne in
on him. Just as sheep, and other animals, mad with
thirst, are bogged in the mud round the sunken
waters, and trodden in by others who are bogged
and die in their turn, so it fared with the giant
creatures of the past in exactly similar clrcum-
stances. This is so plain that even scientists agree
to agree upon it. Similarly, the “worms and
grubs” mentioned by i‘Pro” as embedded in marble
are dead creatures of the sea covered over by the
constantly descending shower of lime from the
decay above of tiny lime-bearing creatures. If “Pro’s”
petrified shoulder-blade which has been plainly
“sawn off square” is genuine, it is a find of import-
ance. The oldest beef-bones showing signs of tool-
as opposed to teeth-marks, are those of the Dordogi*
or Armangnac caves—mere things of yesterday,
probably not more than 200,000 years old or so,
and not fossilised.

“Bogan Bill” : Binghi’s methods of curing

rough. I once rode into a blacks’ camp while a
man was being treated for what. appeared to me to
be pneumonia. Three other nigs had dragged him
out of his gunyah, and while two of them held him
down stark naked a third kept pouring cold water
over him. It was a cold, windy, August day, and
ye t the sick man didn’t die—until the next’ after-
noon.

with blue eyes, fair hair and white faces, but
usually with a very sooty piccanninny at foot, came
up to claim the full-blood status. We passed them,
and they got their supplies.

AN AKAROAN IDYLL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was a thriving countryside,
»Some sixty years ago,
Where settlers always claimed with pride
A dozen kids or so.
Unlike these days it wasn’t thought
A fearful social wrong
If each successive Christmas brought
Another child along.
Now, chief among these men of fame
Was farmer Joseph Binns.
He had eleven to his name —
And four of them were twins.
One midday Joe was in the field
The house not far away—
A-reckoning- up the season’s yield
Of golden oaten hay.
The nurse came to the door and cried,
“You’ve got another, sir,”
“You’ve not surprised me,” he replied;
And brightly smiled at her.
She presently returned and said,
“The missus has one more.”
“Oh, well,” he sighed, and scratched his head,
“It’s happened twice before.”
And then she came and murmured low,
“The twins have got a sis” —
“My God!” he yelled, “I’ll have to go
And put a stop to this.”

“Wyn’s Ex” : I have a starter for “Bel’s”
“Queer Accidents Stakes” (B. 20/7/’22). A carrier
at Yaekandandah (Vic.) was taking a heavy iron
tank from the railway station in a dray, and the
usual boy was hanging on behind. Crossing a
sharp gutter, the tank slipped off the rear of the
dray, and as it fell the manhole slipped over the
youngster. The only results were a boy’s grazed
head and a caged-up yell that would have made
Gabriel’s trump sound silly.
* * * *
“Hecagus”: To some, “Sucre’s” par (B.
;i.3/7/’22), anent a pigeon feeding a crippled mate
may seem fishy; but I’ve got to believe it. The
other day a bullock went down to it on a bare
patch on the road, and each morning as we passed
him we noticed that some Samaritan had been in
attendance with luscious panicum grass. It was
only this morning we found out who the Samaritan
was, and then we saw an old ball-y cow limp up
from the creek to her sick cobber with an outsize
mouthful of grass and a kerosene-tin of water
hanging from one of her horns.
* # * «-
“Torquil.”: I’d advise the Abo. Council
not to attempt to test the theories of “The Moralist”
(B. 29/6/’22) as to litho-fracteur not exploding in
the open air—particularly in the' presence of friends.
Many a time have I broken lumps of ore after
a “firing out” in the stopes by merely laying the
explosive on them. Of course I- used detonators
and fuse, but didn’t trouble to make the charge
air-tight. Some of the pebbles treated in this
THE CRAZE FOR RED.

manner reach big tonnage. I once saw a couple of
“ding-bats” ataiians) place a packet of gelignite
(about 50 small plugs) on a rock, poke a hole
through the packet with the sharp end of the scraper,
stick a detonator and fuse in the opening, and fire
it. The result was satisfactory. I’ll admit that
in some stopes there is not a superabundance of
oxygen.
■ v °
“Azac”: Yes. “Vulture’s” dodge of circling
around a rabbit that it is desired to catch (B.
20/7/’22) is old. When I was a lad on Monaro
(N.S.W.) all hands and the cook would sometimes
fill in Sunday afternoon scouting the nearby pad-
docks in search of squatting rabbits. In Indian file
the party would then begin to circle round Bunny,
on whom all eyes would be fixed. The circle gradu-
ally contracted, and the one whose turn it happened
NON-ALCOHOLIC.

you.”

to be finally darted in and got the prize. This can
be done when the party ( ?) numbers only one, though
Bunny is not caught every time. There were plenty
a bos. round about Canberra many years ago, but 1
never saw or heard of them employing- this trick.
If Binghi did use it in other parts of the country no
doubt he learned it from the dingo. As lads we
picked it up from Rowdy, the station sheep-dog,
although he apparently did not have it copyrighted;
as I have since seen foxes use it. It seems to be
half the game to keep a steady gaze on the rabbit
while the‘circling is going on.
* * * *
“Nor'-West”: A few’ weeks ago I shot a
snake 3ft. 9in. long,
about as thick as a
stockwhip, and dark
reddish-brown in color.
He had a black patch
on the back of the
head and dark black-
ish-brown bands for a
short space along the
body. The underneath
parts were whitish
with vermilion
blotches. I have never
seen one like him, but
the oldest bushman
identified him as the
bandi-bandi of the
blacks. Has the Coun-
cil anything to say
about him ?

“Te W.”: Binghi.
at times, in early days,
lighted upon a stranded
whale, which joyful
event he marked by a
great feast. Bark
notelets were sent out
to all friends within
reach, and both bucks
and gins had a royal
time. It is said that,
as a preliminary, the
bucks usually greased
themselves all over
with blubber. They
then cut whale steaks
from the carcase and
flung them on the
coals c-r spitted them
on sharp sticks and
toasted them before
the fire. The feasts
would continue for
several days, and by
degrees the whale be-
came So hollowed out
that Binghi could climb about inside the
carcase. The whale might or might not have
been partly decomposed when found, and a dism-
tegrating whale can “hum”; but thk didn’t incom-
mode the abo. in any way. Whale-meat, however,
is bilious and indigestible tucker, and some skull-
cracking was often done by bucks with overladen
tummies before the food supply gave out.
“Tauwarra”: My entry for the Pidgin
English Stakes: A Port Moresby cook-boy was sent
to the kitchen for a corkscrew, and returned with
a screwdriver. When the real article was pointed
out to him, he sniffed disdainfully: “What’s the
matter you humbug Tonga me, taubada? This
fella he no korki-sekroo—he tin-opener b’long
bottle.”
* * * *
“Kiiang”: The Northern Territory is col-
lecting some queer
mixtures. Here’s one:
Mother English,
father Malay; eldest
son married to Portu-
guese-Chinese girl, by
whom he has three
children; second son
married to aboriginal-
Norwegian girl, four
children; third son
married to Japanese-
Malay-aboriginal quar-
ter-bred, two children ;
fourth son married to
Spanish-Irish girl,
three children. Yet
all members of that
family call themselves
pure Australians, and
the bitterest insult you
can offer is to refer
to them as colored
folk.

“Aramac” : The
weight of the dressed
bullock at the recent
Cairns (N.Q.) show
was guessed by a
grocer’s hoy to the
pound—93s. Two others
capi e within a
pound on either side.
This reminds me of a
batch of fats headed
for the Townsville
(Q.) Show away back
in ’95. By some
chance they were a day
or so late, and were
turned into Alligator.
Greek works instead.
There were 10 in the
mob, and they aver-
aged 10301 b., the
weights running from
9601 b to 11751 b. Can any Abo. bring a better
lecoid. Incidentally, they brought about 355. a
head all round.
Ito : ’Jiie bus'll undertaker mentioned
y The Moralist” (B. 22/6/’22) jg probably the
sexton-beetle; but that gentleman is a lady, her
motive being an incubatory, and
not a sanitary one. She first lays
her eggs in some stray corpse—
anything up to the size of a
mouse suits her —and then buries
it. When the body is too big
for removal she undermines it,
and then heaps the scrapings over
it in a small mound. There is
also a fly which lays its eggs in
the dead body of another insect,
but this little vixen makes her
own kill and carries it away to
the community nest, which js'usu-
ally in the bank of a stream.
She is a more finished artisan
than the beetle, and embalms the
body in a film of wax, so that
there will be fresh meat for the
young ’uns when they incubate a
season later, after the whole
parent colony has died off. I
can’t recall the correct name of
this particular lady, but probably
some other Abo. can fill the gap.
* *
“Natare”: We had vainly
tried all sorts of remedies to
break our deer-hound off sheep-
chasing when he got the habit of
killing one now and again, so
we thought it time to stop him
permanently. But on the day
sentence of death was passed a
drover blew along, and we told
him our trouble. “I ll stop him,”
he said, “I’ve seen his sort be-
fore.” He took the dog up to
the sheep-yards and tied him
between two old rams. No
sooner had they been let loose than all three cleared
the wall of the yard. Rex was dragged about the
run until the rams were absolutely done up. Sheep
chasing is his last thought nowadays.
* * * *
“W.D.G.”: “Winchester” (B. 13/7/’22)
is dreaming when he says red and grey kangaroos
never associate. I came across three mobs the other
day, and in each there were both reds and greys.
They were all close together, feeding, and they all
left together when I disturbed them. I can’t guar-
antee that they go to the parson together, but it
looks suspicious, as I saw' some dark brown ones
among ’em.
* * # *
“Jim Carew”: My dad, who followed the
gold rushes, tells the yarn that on one field they
were burying a chap when it was discovered that no
man present had a prayer-book, and nobody knew
anything about the burial service. Particularly as
it was a Sunday the diggers reckoned that there
had to be some sort of ceremony, and at last one
(an Australian, by the way) agreed to officiate.
Solemnly he did his very poor best at a prayer, and
when it was over he as solemnly announced, “And
now, boys, we’ll give three blanky cheers for poor
old Dave. He was one of the best.” The cheeis
were given, and his mates heaped a mound over
“poor old Dave,” who doubtless slept just as peace-
fully as if the Archbishop of Canterbury had done
the burying.
* * * *
“Ellon Tommy” : “Natare’s” fox-dog cross
(B. 13/7/’22) reminds me that a friend of mine on
a northern S.A. station has a similar cross. The
mother is a tame vixen, and the father a kelpie
sheep-dog. The offspring has a foxy head and a
smooth coat, but the brush is absent. This little
chap handles sheep and cattle like a champion. As
a painstaking worker he stands alone in the district,
and when things are slow he has been known to take
the afternoon off and “yard” half-a-dozen rabbits in
the corner of a paddock—just to keep his hand in,
I suppose. One peculiarity sets him apart from the
other dogs—he has the fox’s aversion to the touch
of a human hand, and will allow no one, not even
his master, to get near enough to pat him. But the
pastoralists are in for a rough time if sheep-dogs
make a habit of starting family relations with the
foxes. With the dog’s brains and ferocity mated
with the fox's cunning the hybrids running wild will
be hell on earth for livestock. I have heard of one
instance where a dog well enough bred to know
better was seen covertly courting a wild she-fox.
* # * #
“Teamster”: The love-lorn lady dog
(“Jumbo,” B. 20/7/’22) has long been used as a
dingo decoy. A good plan is to take a bag on
which she has been sleeping, tie a string to it—
without touching it with your hands —then drag
it behind you letting the trail lead over your traps;
and, lo 1 his Highness the bachelor will follow
Romance to his destruction.
“D.F.” : When J. Harrison, a member of
the R.A.0.U., was trying to get a photograph of a
young fantail in its nest the old birds grew scared
and would not come near. Their hungry youngsters
squawked lustily, and at last a “yellow-bob,” which
was passing and repassing on the way to its own
nest nearby, stopped and gave one of the alien nip-
pers a bit of tucker to shut it up. The camera
caught it in the act.
* * * *
“L.E.0.”: I doubt “Slinga’s” yarn (B.
20/7/’22) about poisoning crows. In 1907-12 I was
part-owner of Beeclial, adjoining Dundoo station
(S'.-W.Q.), and scores of times I tried both strychnine
and arsenic mixed with fat and spread on hides and
the pelts of freshly-killed sheep. Ten minutes
wards 40 shearers and rouseabouts would be enjoying
the spectacle of about a dozen crows swinging
wrong way up from mulga trees until they made
themselves sick —but in five years we never fpund a
dead one.
UNSEEMLY GENEROSITY.
“Young Bill made a fool of himself down in Sydney .”
“How teas that?”
“lie went to church with a few drinks in, and when the
plate came round, insisted on shouting for the
wholo pew!”
“Boniite”: Evidently the wombats in
“Bull’s AVool’s” district (B. 20/7/’22) must be a
different breed to those here in Tassie. On the
West Coast the flesh of the wombat is by many
preferred to that of the wallaby and kangaroo, and
although I have seen a good few I have never yet
come across one with a diseased • skin. The local
wombat when caught young makes a great pet, and
can be trained to be as clean in his habits as any
good house dog.
* # # *
“The Overlander”: How’s this for a bit
of a spurt? On Yanco Station (Q.) five men
draughted, then—three men out, and two inside the
yard—caught, hand-pulled, castrated, branded and
ear-marked 155 calves and dehorned 15 cows m
three hours and ten minutes. The man handing
the brands in was about 70 years old. G. Cald-
well, of Ashby, and W. Sommerville were in Uie
yard, and the owner was one of the men outside.
BILL’S EPITAPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ole Gidya Bill he was the boss on Gordon River run,
An’ one day, being drunk an’ cross,
He hops upon his wall-eyed hoss
And rides to lick the sun,
A-shouting like a thousand cats all melted into one.
“There ain’t no human bean,” says he, “can ease me
from my stride;
Who thinks lie ’as got one on me,
Has dingbats in his dome,” says he,
“And I will have his hide.
I am the man from Whooparoop whose parents is
cross-eyed.”
i lie ups and hits his wall-eyed moke a slanter in the
ribs.
“Gerrup, yer flamin’ artichoke,”
Says Bill, who liked his little joke—
But that there horse he jibs
An’ fires Bill over on his block an’ kicks him where
he cribs. ‘
Now Bill has crossed- the Great Divide and is -an
angel there.
He sports no trousis since he died;
Around his neck white robes is tied ;
There’s harp-strings in his hair.
But on his tombstone they has wrote: “HIS WALL-
EVED HORSE DON’T CARE.” .

Artist Recording an Edison Re-Creation.
Same Artist proving the Re-Creation by
Direct Comparison.
Only The NEW EDISON sustains
the Direct Comparison Test
This means that The New Edison is the only
phonograph that gives you exactly what the artist
or artists sing or play into the recording horn when
making a Re-Creation.
This means that no other phonograph or talking machine can give you
that lifelike realism you have a right to expect—the absolute realism
that has now been made possible by the world’s greatest inventor.
And, finally, The New Edison offers longer playing time (through its
150 sound-grooves to the inch), freedom from needle-changing, and
Re-Creations that are not liable to breakage and that will not wear out
—an immense economy.

dered, Japan obtained a free gift of the naval
supremacy of the Pacific; a four-Power
guarantee of her insular possessions; and a
twelve-Power guarantee of the status quo in
China. True, Japan evacuates Siberia, but,
as Ivawakami demonstrates, she never would
have gone there except for President Wil-
son’s invitation and mandate. Indeed, it
is clear that Japan anticipates U.S. leader-
ship in Pacific problems will be of about the
same calibre as U.S. leadership of the
Siberian muddle; and the grounds for that
conclusion appear sound. It only remains
to add that the author writes excellent Eng-
lish, not American, and that the appendices
contain all the most important documents
placed before the Conference.
These Young Men
Ten years ago the imaginative youth of
the world was burning quantities of incense
on the altar of the Novel. Not to have writ-
ten a novel was, in my callow set, to confess
oneself a dolt—unless, of course, one had
written, or was about to write, a play. We
sat up in stuffy back rooms until the small
hours discussing Flaubert, Ibsen, Shaw,
Wells and Granville Barker; smoking lots
of tobacco; talking, I trust, lots of dizzy non-
sense. There was a tacit determination to
speak nothing but epigram, and Wilde’s
coruscating characters were our pet models.
Gissing’s novels (there was a cult of Giss-
ing just then) were read aloud by the hour,
and the creepy little dramas of Maurice
Maeterlinck were listened to with varying
degrees of scepticism by all present. The
New Age, edited by the fastidious A. R.
Orage, provided us with a weekly symposium
of literary, {esthetic and philosophical data.
The Red Page was produced, read from,
argued over, waved finally as a flag between
heated factions. Literature was more of a
reality than life itself, and the novel —or
the play—was for us, in that decade, the
form of art that mattered most.
Think of the literary fledgling of to-day
and admire the change in his gods! His
Shaw, his Wells, his Granville Barker are
now relegated to the shelf where function-
less fossils like Gower, Quarles and Tupper
lie beneath a blanket of dust. Not that these
three stars, so new and glittering a dozen
years ago, are intrinsically diminished in his
estimation. lie probably shares the growing
opinion that Bernard Shaw is the greatest
of his kind since Voltaire; and it is pretty
certain that 11. G. Wells is no less a figure
in his eyes than he was in ours. But these
are men that youth no longer looks to for
an interpretation of life. They are great,
but they have had their say and survived the
glamor of novelty. The public has taken its
fill of them, has drunk deep and come to
the dregs. They are out-moded. What
writer of his years and talents is more
lamentably out-moded than Granville Bar-
ker? The literary fledgling of to-day bends
his knee (or flaps his wing) to Ezra
Pound, Rupert Brooke. Squire, Walter
de la Mare, Aldous Huxley, Siegfried Sas-
soon—and 50 others, none of them known
even by name to the sky-scraping cronies of
my recent nonage. The explanation is
simply that the literary "left” of the moment
is composed chiefly of young poets, poetasters
and vers libristes, all of whom are writing
lyrical verse. Lyrical inspiration has in
fact done more to quicken the blood of Eng-
lish literature these latter years than the
prodigious efforts of all the fictionists and
playwrights together. And since Hardy of
Wessex—that anomalous old Man of Genius
—has turned lyrical poet himself, the art of
the novel (for which the pamphleteering
Wells cares nothing) rests mainly on the
Atlas-shoulders of Joseph Conrad. For the
rest, literature finds itself in the flush of
a lyrical burgeoning unparalleled since the
17th century.
Stevenson, I remember, in one of his let-
ters says that it is the length that kills, or
ail but kills, in the writing of a novel. And
as I once (in those callow days) wrote and
re-wrote four times a novel of 90-odd thou-
sand words (unpublished, thank God!), I
know how bitter-true that is. Ruminating
on the psychology of this lyre-smiting out-
burst, I have found myself wondering if
some of these bright young vers libristes
haven’t perhaps known the experience of
being inextricably and hopelessly stuck mid-
way in some such immense bog of words
as, for instance, my “Promethean Fire.”
One imagines how fervently, in such an
event, they would pledge themselves hence-
forth to the writing of nothing but lyrics.
And when it was proved, as it very soon
was, that a respectable literary reputation
could confidently be expected from the carv-
ing of these cherry-stones, small wonder if
they disdained anv heavier labor. But I
suppose it is uncritical to talk like this. For.
although one recognises that the pressure of
the creative passion is commensurate with
the bulk and weight of the work conceived,
one knows well enough that art is no more
a question of muscle or stamina in the mak-
ing than of avoirdupois in the result. “Poetry
is the essence of speech,” as David McKee
Wright says. Now, essential speech, such as
you will find in a lyric by Walter de la
Mare or W. 11. Davies, or in Mr. Wright’s
own lyrics, never by anv chance crops up
in the “Best Seller of the Season,” or in
the hit-or-miss experiments of the Free
Verse poetaster. Being the language of
poets it is; on the other hand, the last thing
that one expects from the mouths of pedants,
prudes and abject purists. But as the
sprightly iconoelasm that one naturally ex-
pects in a young writer of talent—for whom
the “authentic traditions” are merely targets
to shoot darts at—seems of late to be stiffen-
ing into a stagnant convention, one realises
that it is the business of criticism to decide
what to do with vers Wire, as conceived by
those sons of confusion, the Younger Ameri-
can Poets. Whatever their significance, they
have set criticism an altogether new task.
“In order that a sanctuary may be created
a sanctuary must be broken down.” as
N'etzsche excellently says. Rut however
satisfacforilv thev mar have demonstrated
their ability to demolish, these writers have
not so far shown that thev will ev*r
anrthivo, likely to weather the storms of the
centuries.
Whether thev are poets or not. even no-
hodv hut themselves seems to have unite
decided. Nevertheless, the critic who attempts
to ride a h ? srh horse ~t them will he apt * 0
find himself unseated in the encounter The
cock-nosed attitude, for instance, with which
a certain type of critical and culture-parad-
d°n us , ed to approach Walt Whitman
(but for whose "Leaves of Grass’’ these in-
choate and violent counter-strokes to the
tyranny of tradition might never have been
delivered) would be quite pointless in the
case of a hardened and unassailable scholar
like Ezra Pound. A patriarch and progeni-
tor of the “Imagist” group, he arrived in
London from America a dozen years ago,
apparently with the benevolent intention of
pulling English literature out of what he
calls "the Miltonian quagmire,” and very
soon came to be regarded as a Person of Im-
portance. The publication of his hilarious
"Exultations” and “Personae” proved that
lie was, at any rate, capable of fluttering the
immemorial Tennysonian dovecotes; but he
was even then, it seems, a scholar of pro-
found and various culture: a nastv for
hurried and perplexed critics. Here is an
admonition from a paper of his entitled “A
Few Don’ts by an Imagiste” : “Don’t think
any intelligent person is going to he deceived
when you try to shirk all the difficulties of
the unspeakably difficult art of good prose
by chopping your composition into line
lengths.” As Pound is himself the author
of much Free Verse, we may take this as
an indication of his artistic Integrity. But
what touchstone is criticism going to employ
to distinguish the chopped line lengths from
the authentic vers libre that posterity will
want to treasure in its anthologies V Harold
Monro, a young English poet and critic, who
writes with all the air of one who knows
what he is talking about, considers the fol-
lowing “an example of excessive restraint”
and “an ideal specimen of Imagist theory
and practice”:—
OREAD.
Whirl up, sea—
Whirl your pointed pines,
Splash your great pines
On our rocks,
Hurl your green over us,
Cover us with your pools of fir.
That is all. It is by Hilda Doolittle, and she
is a poetess. After quoting this in his book
on “Contemporary Poets” Monro remarks of
her work in general that “the degree of the
reader’s appreciation will depend on the
amount of natural sympathy with which
he temperamentally can approach it.”
After this, one remains placid while he
declares that “verse is undoubtedly in-
ferior to prose as a medium.” “It is easier
to write,” he adds. So it is—when a Martin
Tupper or an Ella Wheeler Wilcox is the
writer. The alternative inference is that
the poet is in a state of rare inspiration,
writing like an angel and keeping his pipe
serenely alight at the same time. But
although the bulk of the better verse of to-
day is good, fresh, strong, penetrative stuff,
it is evident that inspiration is still, as ever,
the rarest thing in the world. The authori-
tative Monro notwithstanding, and notwith-
standing my own great delight in good prose,
I daresay I shall continue to regard all
writing—certainly all “poetry”—that is not
specifically and essentially verse as the sort
of suburbs or nether parts of literature.
(P.S. —After thus confidently deciding
that the Dovel and the drama are moribund,
I learn that Louis Esson, whose comedy,
“The Battler,” was produced here in the
Melbourne Playhouse on May 18, has re-
turned to his native country for the express
purpose of “building up a school of Aus-
tralian drama.” in which respect he is spoken
of as “a pioneer.” Is the wheel turning
again? Or. as a Red Page writer argued
the other d*iy, are the literary activities of
Australia 20 years behind the movement?)
ADRIAN LAWLOR.
Beauty and the Beast
Harley Matthews’s Red Page article
(d/</'22) is interesting, inasmuch as it
provides a glimpse into the inner mind of
an apologist for the modern art movements.
But it leaves one doubtful of his competence
as a critic. He quotes Rodin’s Balzac as
perhaps one of the causes of the great man’s
acceptance, whereas that figure caused the
biggest quarrel in the sculptor’s stormy career.
And he mixes up Renoir, Cezanne, Manet,
Monet, Gaugin and Rodin in reckless
fashion. Only in his latest work is Renoir
a modernist. Manet was a realist who
learned a little design from Velasquez;
Monet an impressionist; Cezanne a simple,
decent man and bad painter, who went to
classes right till the end in a vain endeavor
to learn how to draw. Gaugin was a Creole
who went straight to primitive forms and
color by instinct, whereas Cezanne went to
them merely because he had not the mental
power to define form.
Primitivism has not reached Australia
except in one abortive attempt bv De Mestre
and Wakelin some years ago, in some of
Lambert’s more deliberate efforts to sur-
prise (he knows he is too clever a draughts-
man to throw that gift away), and in some
of the women-painters who have the usual
feminine weakness of intellect, and wish,
naturally, to show how ifashionable and
European they can be. It has not reached
us, for the very good reason that we have
a genuine art, and because we have no hordes
of studio-folk and tenth-rate painters, the
underworld of art, to push like any other
mob after the latest thing.
Conventional art, says Mr. Matthews, has
been bolstered up by the literary critic, re-
peating there the good old cry that every
minor critic has been elaborating since
Whistler jeered at Frith. That academic
form of art has long been dead: if it ever
can be said to have lived. It never belonged
to anyone except the people. It was Manet
who formulated the modern slogan, “Paint
nothing that you haven’t seen or might see
anv day.” For, to the realist, there is no
difference between a bacchanal by Rubens
and the “Drunken Maenad” by Lord Leieh-
ton;.between the subject-pictures of Rubens
or Titian and a mid-Victorian oleograph, or
one of Alma Tadema’s frozen classical re-
constructions. But because the academic
poet writes odes to the death of Somebody
or lines about a goldfish, we do not banish
subject” from poetry.
Mr. Matthews jeers at the attacks on
the defective eyes’vht of some of the mod-
erns, nod says that at least it was their
own. This may be true of Cezanne, who,
his biographer tells us, had a defici-
ency in his eyesight that made him incline
objects towards the centre of vision. No
wonder his admirers were annoved to be
told this, since thev bad. been findmg pro-
fundities in this very point. In the case
of Augustus John, however, there is no
such excuse. John is, or was, a perfect
realistic draughtsman; but he has deliber-
ately and confessedly imitated El Greco,
who suffered from stigmatism and astrabis-
mus, and John now produces the strange
long heads and curious perspectives of that
painter.
This brings us to a direct denial of the
statement that modern art has arisen despite
the literary critics. It has arisen soiely
because of those critics, who, eager to be in
the movement, soon started vying with one
another in discovering fresh virtues in any-
thing brought forward. As for the opposi-
tion, after the first assaults of the conserva-
tive press were weathered, its attacks
became a good advertisement. Modern
art is not a new thing. It is as old as the
savage. And if we in Australia are behind
(or ahead of) the times in this respect, we
have the consolation of the knowledge that
the natives along the Congo are probably in
the forefront of the fashion. There' has
always been a crowd of people willing to
paint like savages, to fling undefined forms
together, to splash color about, to picture
men with green faces and purple noses. It
is only because the critics have made a
virtue of. these things that they are now
indulged in publicly with praise. There is
no need to point out that beneath the phrases
. joy of color,” “simple forms,” and so on, there
is really the desire to destroy the effort to
define forms not merely as actual forms but
as elements of rhythm, which puts such a
strain on the mind’s power; to destroy the
effort to use color as an element of light
by chiaroscuro. Mr. Matthews’s article is
really an attack on his own statement that
modern art is the liberation of art from
the literary critic; for he himself is in it
one of the thousand minor literary voices
who repeat that we must not con-
demn, but must wait for the fruits.
He forgets, as Nietzsche would have told
him, that the psychologist, or he who seeks
values, no longer says, “By their fruits ye,
shall know them,” but “Thev are fruits, and
from them I learn the soil out of which
they grew.” When n movement has its
roots in the mud of primitivism, there is
no need to sit around waiting for the golden
ajpple to appear on the prioklv-pear. It
simply cannot come. Out of the soil of
Praxiteles, Titian, Rubens, Turner (or, if
you insist on more modern names, of Corot
and Degas) the artist will grow; and he
will not think that “there are very few
things worth making” a picture of. He
will be obsessed by the inexhauspble beauty
and passion of life. And none of the modern
critics will notice him.

The Inky Way
“Norbeir: In Sydney Sun the other day "Warby,”
as a synonynom for beer-sparrer, hum or dead-beat,
was classed as “a new word.” It is 30-odd years
Old, and was coined to fit the derelicts who used
to line up to the counter-lunch at Warby’s Hotel,
corner of Pitt and King streets, Sydney. It is
usually abbreviated to “Warb.”
“Azac”: Received a postcard from the Deutsches
Entomologisches Institut at Berlin the other day
reminding me that “before the war”- I was inter-
ested in their publications, and they would like to
resume relations with me. “We would highly get
pleased if you to this proposal agree.” I was in-
formed. But what took my eye was the following.
which was conspicuously printed in red on the front
of the postcard: “All Men of Science are Brothers...
Edgew David (August, 1914).” No doubt they have
a different quotation for each country.
The first number of Cheerio has reached this
office. Described as a journal for “ordinary human
folk who' hold Liberty precious” it is chiefly a bomb
aimed at the blue-ribbon crowd. There are articles
on prohibition in America and the medical aspect of
dryness, and a prize of ten guineas is offered to the
writer of the best article on “Why I am Opposed to
Prohibition.” It is a bright little publication
which ought to wring a grin or two even out of him
who is in a sense the real author of its being—
namely the fast-approaching “Pussyfoot” Johnson.
“Ike Hollar” : Gertrude Page, the Rhodesian novelist,
died worth £31,104, entirely made out of books,
and there are half-a-dozen other S. Africans who are
doing almost equally well—some of them better —
out of novel-writing. How many Australian writers
with better talents will be able to leave as many
pence? From an ordinary literary standpoint—in
the production of magazine and comment journuls
—South Africa is almost barren. But that very
barrenness supplies a reason. The person who must
write, having no local paper to absorb his (or, very
frequently, her) output, puts it into novel form,
sends it to London and often scores better.
“Machete”: "Veronal” kicks himself (B. 27/7/’22)
because he once missed the chance of buying two
paper-covered Kiplings (Wheeler’s Indian Railway
edition) at 9d. How’s this? Not 18 months since
I bought an unopened copy of “The City of Dread-
ful Night” (same edition) for one shilling. Within
10 minutes and not a hundred yards down the
street, I had sold it for a quid. Both seller and
buyer were second-hand book dealers. One has :io
sympathy of mine, the other needs none; as far as
I know these editions are worth £4 or £5 in
London. Anyway, my profit is the best I have made
since 1 gave up horse-coping.
A Satchel of Books
The Boss of Killara, by Vance Palmer. The latest
of the N.S.W. Bookstall novels, a series which,
happily, the eo. intends to continue to publish as
before the death of the founder, A. C. Rowlandson.
Palmer sets his scene on an out-back station, and
what with the 'struggle of its you ok owner to lift
the place out of the financial ditch, a picnic race
mectiiiK, an attempted horse theft, the doings at a
wayside shanty and a strong love interest, he puts
together a light, readable yarn admirably suited
to a railway journey.
Reminiscences of an Indian Cavalry Officer, by Col.
J. S. E. Western, C.B.E. (Geo. Allen and Unwin).
The author stands perfectly for one type of the old
Regular officer—the kind whose conversation eternally
pivoted upon polo, eatables, hunting, servants and
the women of their set. For no reason discoverable
within themselves they regarded the British officer
as the salt of the earth, and, for rather more obvious
reasons, an enlightened democracy was anathema to
them. You get their outlook exactly from this
quite unnecessary volume of reminiscences by an
estimable old gentleman who, after a lifetime in
the service, retired with the rank of colonel. A
book of most amazingly small beer.
A Cuckoo in the Nest, by Ben Travers (John
Lane), is a fairly pleasing story, something on the
lines of a “bedroom play.’’ At all events the most
interesting scene, and the one on which the plot
mostly turns, takes place in a double-bedded apart-
ment, the same being located not in a city flat, buf
in a remote Somersetshire pub. Ben Travers has
undeniable humor, but he somewhat over-colors his
characters and spins out jokes, like a cat killing
a monse, at enthusiastic length. It is perhaps un-
necessary to mention that the pair who share the
bedroom at the “Stag and Hunt,” Maiden Blotton,
are young and recently married—not to each other—
and that nothing is really fractured by their conduct
except the conventions. The last chapter leaves
the two persons who have been readiest to suspect
evil and to make mischief locked up in a bedroom
by themselves, to see how they like it.
THE PLATER : “What do you think of this shirt I'm wearing?”
THE OTHER: “Well, it ought to be good — I know what you pay for your clothes
THE PLAYER: “As it happens, though, this Zephyr Golf Shirt cost me only 7/11 at
David Jones', and is typical of the values throughout the store. You should go
along and see for yourself.”

Kew has saved the soles of the district for
the past 40 years.
“Cutter”: If the axe-handle argument

assurance that the Australian article is
recognised as the best shovel-handle on the

“Saaedi”: “Clep’s” ’possum-skin dealer,
who was fined 2s. per pelt, might have been
much harder hit. A N.S.VV. magistrate
recently fined a man ss. a skin for having
287 ’possum-skins in his possession. As the
delinquent had originally paid 152 for the
fur, his flutter in ’possum pelts cost him f 123-
odd. Incidentally, he forfeited the fur.
“Kus”: “Cruma’s” vaselined eggs (B.
20/7/’22) remind me that a covering of i
treacle or molasses is a common country
method of egg preservation. Many house- •
wives keep the eggs for two or three years
by this means, and, when the “cocky’s joy”
has served its turn as a preservative, it is ■
often used for ordinary domestic purposes
by the economic farm-wife. It is one of the
reasons why treacle puddings are so popular
in the country.
“Gouger”: The old Cooktown Plantation's,
Ltd., is now the N.Q. Products, Ltd., re-
capitalising for £200,000. The idea is to
start a big settlement scheme and grow
rice, ginger, peanuts and a score of other
tropical and semi-tropical crops for which
this part of N.Q. lias long been proved suit-
able. Later on it is proposed to build an
oil-treatment mill to exploit the peanuts.
The idea is to work the ground on the share

“Two Seas”: Let me in on this axe-

was offered one of the pallid Yankee handles
at our local store for 4s. Gd.! (Once it was

thing cheaper, and the storekeeper apolo- •
getically introduced a “not-much-good Aus-
tralian handle,” price Is. Gd. I took it, have
still got it, and want nothing better. Have
since learned that my dinkuin Australian
axe-handle was manufactured near Bungeu-
dore out of jingera hardwood. My opinion
is that the man who continues to pay 4s. Gd.
for an imported handle, pick or axe, is
either millionaire or plain ass.

“U.P.”: In South Australia there are
1487 applicants (824 in the metropolitan
area and 663 in the country) waiting for the
telephone service to be put on to their
premises, and the Department advises
grumbling citizens that they will have to
wait two years before they can be connected.
Deputy-P.M.G. Kitto gives as an excuse
that for a long time there w T as .no money
wherewith to buy material, and now the
money is available no material is obtain-
able. There is, it seems, a world-wide
shortage in ’phone equipment, and the Euro-
pean and Yankee telephone factories are
crowded out with orders. There are 200,060
intending ’phone subscribers awaiting service
in the United Kingdom alone, so we have
not much chance on this side. Perhaps it
will occur to Australians some day that it
might be possible to make the equipment
here.

“Park” : Westralians are much perturbed
at the thought of “culture” pearls, as dis-
covered by the wily Japanese, upsetting the
staple industry of the north-west coast of
W.A. In response to the complaint of
Broome pearlers that oysters are being arti-
ficially stimulated by the enterprising Asiatic
the State Government has ordered that the
practice must stop, while the Commonwealth
Government is being requested to legislate to
prohibit the importation into Australia of
“culture” pearls or the beads used in their
artificial production. Westralia supplies
75 per cent, of the world’s pearlshell and
pearls; the annual production of the
pearling grounds is valued approximately
at £350,000, about four-fifths of the
income being derived from shell. Although
the bulk of the business is in shell,
the 300 boats working the grounds make a
nice profit from the pearls, and the chance
of a.n occasional valuable find brings in the
gambling element, which makes the job
attractive. The pearlers consider there will
be a stigma on the North-West should the
grounds be associated with anything but the
natural product.

“J.K.”: Re Chinese guile. Some years
ago at Cooktown, North Queensland, Burns,
Philp and Co. and Cfunn and Sons, mer-
chants, agreed to discontinue giving Christ-
mas boxes. They approached Tommy Ah
Kum, the Chinese merchant, suggesting that
he should fall into line. Tommy demurred
at first, averring that he thought “more
better give Clistmas boxes—catchem back
longa plofit.” However, he eventually gave
in, and undertook to co-operate with the
other firms in the abolition of the old Yule-
tide practice. Subsequently one of Burns,
Philp’s coasting skippers mentioned to a
storekeeper of the firm that his wife had
been given a ham for a Christmas box by
Tommy Ah Kum. There was a hurried
indignation meeting, followed by a visit to
Tommy, who was charged with black treach-
ery. The Celestial, however. flatly domed
that he “givem ham to ladv.” The upshot
of it was that the beneficiary herself was
consulted. She said that the question put
to her was “You gottem penny, missus?”
She admitted the possession of one, and
Tommy then said, “Olli. I sellem you ham
for penny.”

whole of the design ensure biggest tallies for least labor.
The cutter has plenty of wearing surface at the fork end
and great depth, giving it long life. The “Plain-back’
Cutter is a slight variation from the Standard, specially
made for light-woolled sheep, such as are found in Queens-
land. . .
The steel from which all “Lister” Combs and Cutters are
made is the outcome of countless laboratory, workshop and
shearing-shed experiments, and represents the highest possible
achievements in comb and cutter manufacture. The result
is that “Lister” Combs and Cutters , take the keenest edge
and keep it longer than any other. There is less grinding
and, therefore, less expense in using “Listers.” To meet
the varying conditions in different parts of the Common-
wealth, ““Lister” Combs and Cutters are made in several
styles and widths. Each is designed for a special purpose
and all are guaranteed of uniform quality and finish. They
reach you ready to put into the wooL

The JtMQ “Flier”
intermediate Comb and Cutter.
The Lister “Flier” Comb was the great hit of the 1921
season and was used in thousands. Its great popularity was
due to its being the widest-cutting Comb possible with the
Standard 1/- Cutter, and also the widest-cutting Comb at
4/-. It was universally recognised as a beautiful-cutting
comb, entering the densest wool freely without picking up
skin.
For this width Listers completed a perfect combination
by introducing the special “Flier” Cutter—sold at the same
price as Standar.d-r-ana with the usual “Lister” properties
of fast-cutting and edge-holding.
A Shearer writes: “I used your ‘Flier’
Combs and Cutters last year and found them
a great success. I SHORE FOUR THOUSAND
SHEEP WITH TWO COMBS AND SIX
CUTTERS.”

The JlsTffß “Racer”
Medium Comb (10-tooth) and Cutter.
This is the widest Comb allowed bp' the A.W.U., and
undoubtedly the comb of the future. It is designed to take
the place of the 11-tooth Medium Comb which has been
proved mechanically wrong when used with a 3-tooth cutter!.
The Lister “Racer” can be used with a 3-tooth cutter with
perfect results on iniy handpiece without any special fork or
fork-spring. It is made With an exceptionally wide-cutting
surface over the whole length of each tooth, obviating.any
danger of picking up skin, even when the comb is ground
right, down. Shearers who have used this comb already
pronounce it the finest and cleanest-cutting comb ever put
into wool.
The “Racer” can be used with Standard Medium Cutter,
but gives best results when combined with the “Racer”
Cutter —a 1922 introduction. This cutter is specially
arranged to get the full pressure over the centre of each
outside tooth instead of on the inside as with the usual
Medium Cutter. The result is a liveliness and steadiness
of action which, in conjunction with the “Racer” Comb, is
worth something like six sheep per run to any good shearer.

GIVEN an adequate source to draw
from—river, creek, dam, or bore-
C . hole—a “BILLABONG” Wind-
mill Plant will put an end to all worries
connected with your water supply for
stock or household use. It will give out-
and-out satisfaction to every owner,
everywhere, and all the time.
If you are contemplating the purchase
of a Windmill, investigate the merits of
the “BILLABONG.. “BILLABONG”
Troughing and Fluming are other mem-
bers of the same family, that are equally
reliable in their service-giving qualities.
The “BILLABONG” Windmill is built to ensure
the utmost reliability under all conditions. its effici-
ency is due to a number of patented features not found
in any other windmill, while its simplicity of construc-
tion permits of it being sold at the price of an ordinary
mill.
The “BILLABONG” is fitted with a patent governor
and regulator, which automatically controls the wheel
in heavy gales, but leaves it free to work with the
lightest breeze. It is a usual sight to see the “BILLA-
BONG” at work when other mills are idle.
It would need a book to tell you all we would like
you to know about the “BILLABONG.” Mill. That
book is available for the asking—write to-day for
Booklet “W 65.”
“BILLABONG” Troughing is made with a patent
interlocking, leak-proof joint that cannot pull apart. It
is set into a heavy Angle and T steel frame which forms
a rigid bed for the trough, and enables it to withstand
rough usage and hard bumps.
We can supply “BILLABONG” Troughing, in any
length, for sheep or cattle. Write for descriptive leaflet
“W 27.”
“BILLABONG” Fluming is designed to prevent the
waste of water by syakage and washaways in irrigation
channels. It is much cheaper than tubing, and may
be used above or on the surface, or set into the ground.
We manufacture “BILLABONG” Fluming in a number
of styles, with fittings to suit various ordinary require-
ments. Write for descriptive leaflet “W 28.”

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t allow old
fermenting food to stay in them for davs,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con*
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many iolks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain's Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are mild and gentle in their action and
pleasant to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

CHAMBERLAINS
COUGH REMEDY
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.
SPLIT PULLEY
A Heavier Load with a Lighter Pullej
Because of its unique construction the SKF Split Pulley can be used
for loads much heavier in comparison with the usually accepted
ratio of riveted or built-up pulleys.
This means distinct economy and a substantial saving in power.
Though the SKF Split Pulley is light in weight, nothing is sacrificed
in strength, it being not too heavy for the lightest loads at high
speed, yet sufficiently strong to transmit maximum loads on normal
drives at reasonable belt speeds.
Accurate balancing and rivetless construction also assure the
advantages of saving in wear and tear of belts, machines and
bearings.
For efficiency and economy’s sake you
should write for further particulars.

in compliment to the brilliant veteran who so

“Whitebait”: Speaker Johnston, of the
Reps., who was once a scene-painter, still
keeps his hand in with paint and pencil and
his official cards of Christmas and New Year
remembrances are always illustrated by re-
productions of his water-colors. He also
knows something of lithography. In the
window of an antique shop in Spring-street,
not far from Parliament House, there is a
lithograph, signed by him, of one of the first
houses erected in Melbourne—the little home
of Dr. Howitt, built in Flindtrs-lane, near
Spring-street, in the thirties of last century,
and having at that time grounds extending
from Collins-street to the banks of the Yarra
The old place, which was originally brought
out in parts from England, was demolished
a little while back, and there is now appa-
rently nothing but Johnston’s sketch as a
reminder.
“U.P.”: I notice that King George
attended a display of the Royal Philatelic
Society in London recently, and exhibited
some rare specimens. They were all
Australian stamps, and included the un-
usual error of a West Australia 4d.
with “inverted swan,” and an unused
block of six of the 2d. “Laureated”
N. S. Wales, with six-rayed stars in the
four corners, Is. emerald-green New Zealand,
and two of the blue-green shade. There
were also stamps from Queensland, S. Aus.
and Victoria. And this reminds me that
when I was a youthful philatelist, hearing of
George’s weakness, I sent the gem of my
collection to him, hoping to receive a
Iv.C.M.G. or something, but didn’t even get
an acknowledgment.
“U.P.”: Up to just recently the S.A. Gas
Co. Ims not produced anythin*' much but gas
and dividends, but now, in Adcdaide, they are
conducting experiments in artificial manures
by growing wheat and other crops on the
roof of their Waymouth-street building.
Their idea is to prove the advantages of
sulphate of ammonia (a product of the Gas
Co.) in cultivation. In a wirenetted enclo-
sure, 40ft. above the city dust, they have
large earthenware pots planted with wheat,
oats, vines, onions, potatoes, cotton and even
poppies and a couple of orange-trees. One
lot of each has been planted in average soil
and another lot is being assisted with the
ammonia and super. The pots are not being
protected from the elements, and are given
no invidious advantages one over the other.
The reason for this potted intense culture is
the Gas Co.’s wish to display the plants at the
Adelaide September show, and endeavor to
prove to the farmers and gardeners the ad-
vantages of fertilisers, especially their own
product. Now that superphosphate has given
the man on the land in S. Aus. an increased
yield of 50 per cent, he is not so pessimistic
regarding artificial soil stimulants as he
was 20 years ago.
Vic. Upper Chamber cannot boast any
member dating back beyond 1891, the
year Sternberg was first elected. President
Manifold and ex-Minister T. 11. Payne, who
come next in seniority, entered 10 years later.
When the House was reformed in 1904, there
were 35 members, including one direct repre-
sentative of the public service and railway
men. Bent swept away the special mem-
ber (along with two in the Assembly) at
the bidding of his friend Dave Gaunson, one
of the aforesaid delegates. Of this original
“reformed” band of 35, 10 did not seek re-
election when their terms expired, eight
resigned, and three bit the dust on polling
day. From 1856 till 1901 there were four
Presidents —Palmer, Mitchell, Mcßain, Zeal,
and in the 21 years since 1901 there have
been three —Wrixon, Davies and Manifold.
The Speck’s annual Labor conference
adopted the Brisbane objective, with “cer-
tain modifications” which have not been made
public. Appeals against three expulsions for
“disloyal actions during the election” occu-
pied several sessions. E. Dwyer Gray, for-
merly editor of the World, had his expul-
sion confirmed by a narrow majority; Sam
Champ (chairman of Denison Divisional
Council) was granted an adjournment till
next conference for the production of rebut-
ting evidence, and Gerald Mahoney (sec.,
Denison Divisional Council) satisfied a majo-
rity that his alleged disloyalty was uninten-
tional or accidental or something, and his
expulsion was rescinded. The charge in all
three cases was failure to advocate the full
ticket at the election.
“Perdix”: Tasmanian railway rates pass
all ordinary comprehension. They fix the
freight on a ton of nails from Burnie to
Launceston, 112 miles, at 14s. 6d., and from
Launceston to Scottsdale, 48 miles, at 375.
6d.! Only the other day a commercial saved
money in forwarding goods to Hobart by
shipping first to Melbourne and then tran-
shipping to their destination. Yet in one
instance there is do differentiation for mile-
age. A case of apples is carried any distance
on a Government railway for the charge of
one shilling.
“Hargo”: The Post Office Hotel, Cudal
(N.S.W.), just closed by order of the De-
licensing Board, began to quench the thirst
of trekkers to the Lachlan (now Forbes)
gold disraings well over 60 years ago, with
Tom O’Brien turning the tap. His succes-
sor was one Peisley, who brewed his own
stuff when the waggons failed to come up
to time. The exterminated pub had the dis-
tinction of never having been “mentioned”
in court for a breach of the Liquor Act.
“Jackeroo”: Andrew’ Banning recently pur-
chased 200 head of cattle on the Diamantina
(Q.) for 10s. per head, and another lot of
1400 mixed cattle at 15is. per head. And
still Theodore and Co. are snooting the rents
skywards.
“Bullwhanger”: Although inter-State
steamers are tied up in nearly every Aus-
tralian port the Melbourne Steamship Co.
are evidently stuck for tonnage, as they are
bringing' out a new hooker soon—the Ella-
r£°’ ? 4643-ton 10-knotter, recently pur-
chased frotp Norway. She carries a cargo
of coal for Karachi, and has Captain Bro-
therson, who brought out the co.’s latest
steamer, the Ooolana, on the bridge.

Those Suffering
Shavers
To hear a lot of men talk you’d
think their beards were a curse
of nature and that the owners
were doomed to lifelong shaving
torture.
But I notice that the minute one
of these self-appointed suffering
shavers invests inatubeof Mennen
Shaving Cream and dares it to
soften HIS beard, he almost im-
mediately starts talking about how
tough his beard used to be!
Over two million users say that
Mennen’s ..can lick the wiriest
hedge that ever sprouted around
a man's jawbone. Three minutes
of lathering—hot or cold water —
no rubbing with the fingers. Then
shave! You’ll never go back to
hard soap.

Airman Blake, now endeavoring to encom-
pass the globe, is accompanied by the son of
that Westralian Governor after whom
Broome was called. Col. L. E. Broome,
official geographer and photographer with
Blake, lived as n boy in Perth, and liked it
so much that when he grew up he returned,
joined the mounted police, and put in a
eßuplejof years on goldfields duty during the
Coolgardie and Kalgooi’lie rushes.
A S. Aus. veteran who carries a cartload
of degrees—B.A. (Cantab), M.A.. B.C.L.
(Oxon) and LL.D. (Dublin and Adelaide)
among them —is Dr. William G. Torr, now
nearly 70 years old. and living in retire-
ment at Brighton (S.A.). As an infant he
came tp Australia with his father, a Devon-
shire miner, who could not write his own
name, and eventually became a public-school
teacher: but in ISB6, when 33, he went to
England, after ’Varsity degrees. On his
return lie became principal of Way College,
opened in 1892. He controlled that insti-
tution for ll years until the Methodist.
Union got it turned into the Ladies’ Metho-
dist College, After that the Doc. did mis-
sionary work in Australia and Maoriland
for some years, and then, in 1909, started
the Methodist Training Home at Brighton,
of which he was principal until he retired
last year. Despite his English degrees he
is a good Australian.
“Iota” : What is to be the future of the
Lithgow Small-arms Factory? Mention has
been made in the House of Reps, of the
unsuitability of the plant for making
telephones and their accessories, but it was
admitted that good hammers had been made
there. Why shouldn’t they continue to be
made? Both the Remington and the Win-
chester firms (U.S.A.) are concentrating on
small tools (hammers, hatchets, pliers,
saws, etc.) with success. There are too
many workless engineers . and too few Aus-
tralian-made tools in this country, and no
avenue of employment should be closed down
unless it is shown to be unpayable.
“B.” : In common with some other Aus-
tralian industries, shipbuilding at Port
Adelaide will shortly be in a precarious con-
dition —Hughes cannot promise further sup-
port when the present contract for three
ships is completed, so the industry will have
to depend on State and outside work. Poole
and Steele are still employing 250 men at
their Osborne shipbuilding yards, and the
third steamer built for the Commonwealth
Government will be launched during October
and completed somewhere about the end of
the year. The other two S.A.-lniilt boats
have been taken over by the Commonwealth
Government, although the Euwarra is still
in the Port River. The first S.A. produc-
tion—the Eurimbla —is out of commission with
a number of other boats at Williamstown
(Vic.). The Commonwealth Oil Refinery Co.,
of Melbourne, has given the firm a contract
for 13 oil tanks, and the S.A. Government in-
tend building two dredgers (suction and
bucket) which work, if secured, may keep
the Osborne yards going.
“Senojo”: The anti-Cliow feeling of
Clunes, Vic. (“Billy T.,” 27/7/’2U) is
shared by Zeelian (Tas.). When Zeehan
and its surrounding hills oozed miners, woo-
betide the Chow who dumped his matted
baggage on the station platform. His arri-
val was heralded like a radio signal, and
half the townspeople flocked towards the in-
vader. John would be escorted to the first
of a long line of pubs, allowed to have a
meal, and packed Burniewards by a train
that left in the afternoon. One day a Celes-
tial evaded the pickets and established his
temple in an old hut. The. younger genera-
tion discovered the prohibited immigrant
first, and dropped some powerful medicine
into his water-supply. When he left it was
on a stretcher. Zeelian’s antipathy to China
men is still as strong as ever, although the
settlement’s light has been very dim of late.
Adelaide ’Varsity Senate has lost its
warden and clerk (or chairman and secre-
tary) and won’t know itself without them.
Frederic Chapplg has been warden since
1883, as well as a member of the Council
from 1897. Since giving up the headmaster-
ship of Prince Alfred he has been doing
Y.M.C.A. work, but a smashing fall on
a staircase has put him out of action.
Ainslie Caterer, whose health has badly
broken down, has been clerk since 1888. All
that time he has been on the teaching staff of
St. Peter’s, and in the long interregnum be-
tween Girdlestone and Bickersteth, was
actin g-headmaster.
“Chris”: The city fathers of Wellington
(M.L.) have just achieved a world’s record
by collaring the local milk trade. The cow-
juice arrives from the municipal and other
farms by rail and civic-owned motor-lorries,
is pasteurised at the municipal depot and
delivered to householders by municipal
carters. Eighteen thousand sealed bottles'
went out on 10th July. Private Enterprise
is satisfied; it was well paid to give up the
job. Some people had the shock of their
lives when they got full measure under the
new regime; they didn’t know the other
blokes had given them short supplies. And
there’s talk of reducing the price, too.
“Country Ped.”: I notice that most of the
boosters of cotton-growing are at much pains
to point out that this industry is essentially
a family affair. In other words, dad and
mum and the youngsters, especially the last,
will be able to do all that is wanted when
picking time comes round. If this industry
is to rely on child labor to make it a payable
proposition I am sorry for the kids. We
have enough child slaves now- on the cow
farms without adding to them in the cotton
fields.
“Senojo”: Four telegraphists, to my per-
sonal knowledge, are so deaf that ordinary
conversation is carried on w r ith them under
difficulties; yet they are competent operators
and can take the Morse signals at the usual
average speed of 20 to 25 w r ords per minute.
The metallic ring given out by the sounder
penetrates tlieir apparent deafness.
“Meataxe”: The new' roundhouse at Laun-
ceston. for the Speck’s railway engines, wall
be the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere.
Radially distributed stalls, fitted with hot-
water services for washing-out _ boilers and
“warming-up” pits for renewing wheels,
cleaning and repairing—these are supplied
to “stable” 40 engines. The stalls converge
on the electric turntable, weighing 96 tons,
having a diameter of 75ft.. and capable of
carrying 210 tons. This is set in a rein-
forced concrete pit. The old engine-shed
which is being replaced has lived over 60
years.

If you are fond of drawing you

demand for new sketches that persons of
very moderate ability earn good fees.
But to get the best results you should
learn direct from a successful artist.
Under Mr, J, C. Bancks, the well-known
cartoonist and caricaturist, and by his easy
system of lessons by post, many persons
of both sexes are now being trained to
do money-earning sketches.
Mr. Bancks himself supervises every
student’s work and personally corrects
and advises them by letter on each lesson.

"Parlor, Bedroom and Bath,” a very little
thing to stage at the spacious Melbourne
Royal, is an up-to-date American xarcical
comedy of the hind that Coyne specialised
in. An earlier and better example of bed-
room comedy with a mild husband in the
foreground, was “Fair and Warmer,” but
the present rush of unrealism compares not
unfavorably with a certain entertainment
that consisted largely of Marie le Varre in
pyjamas. Marie is an important factor in
“Parlor, etc.,” but this time she wears a
series of glad rags which she calls “scenery,”
and her duty is to strike poses and reel off
ankeeisms in the alleged capacity of a
woman-journalist who hires herself out to
impersonate impropriety at 500 dollars per
stunt, or thereabouts. Other characters are
nearly as frankly stagey as Marie, though
they get less burlesque out of their jobs.
Generally speaking, they weaken after the
tirst act, growing more unnatural on
acquaintance. Exceptions to this rule are
Marjorie Bennett, who expresses perturba-
tion in a bath with a nice sense of decency,
and Lucie Carter as a tall relative, who
seems rather shocked than otherwise at
giddy complications arising from the prox-
imity of the bedroom and bath to the parlor.
Probably these complications would become
less pallsome after an hour of them if Phil-
lips Tead were more fitted to his character,
and several other people, including the
matured bell-boy, had a lighter touch. Edith
Drayson’s pronounced artificiality is as dis-
appointing as Frank Bradley’s stodginess, or
the unfurnished style of Reginald Collins.
Nothing matters very much, however, in
this passing appeal to public indulgence, ex-
cept the bath, bed and pervading atmosphere
of larks, scandal and divorce. For people
who like this sort of thing this is the sort
of thing they will like. It is lively cricket.
Several sixers are scored during the even-
ing, the strongest suggestions going well over
the fence.

"THE PEEP SHOW,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Dan Booker as George Chickweed.
At the King's, where Emelie Polini dreams
“My Lady’s Dress” in varied spasms, the bloke
who has contracted to marry Lisa invariably
speaks contemptuously of their approaching
nuptials as “a three-poun’ wedding.” After
which his prospective sister-in-law saves the
family pride by selling her blasted black ’air
for 10 quid, gordelper!
Melbourne’s Pioneer Players started their
Thursday night series at the Temperance
Hall with “John Blake,” a doleful drama
in four brief acts, by Stewart Macky. How
1 much of it is Macky and how many “cer-
tain. episodes have been taken from the
official Historical Records and the works
of the late Price Warung” ( vide pro-
gramme) only the author can say. But any-
one familiar with Marcus Clarke’s “For
the Term of His Natural” can detect a
strong resemblance between little Master
Blake’s fondness for convict Warrington in
this sketchy story, and the affection of little
Miss Vickers for her pet Rufus in the dra-
matised novel of old. Also, it is clear that
the Warrington who is a victim of John
Blake’s “system”-atic harshness in 1526, and
who ultimately murders him at Williams-
town in 1843 (even as John Price, father
of Col. Tom Price, was done to death by
vengeful lags), is a perversion of the histor.c
character of pickpocket Barrington, who
flourished in Sydney under Governor Phillip.
Stewart Macky’s play, as it stands, contains
some essentials for a strong, dispiriting melo-
drama of the convict period, dating from
Macquarie’s time in N.S.W., and Norfolk
Island. Though destitute of hero, heroine
or “heart,” it is worth considering. Padded,
picturesquely staged, and acted by forcible
professionals it would at least be a melo-
drama of importance, abhorrent to some of
Australia’s oldest families, and more inter-
esting to thinkers than any dramatised ver-
sion of “His Natural Life.” The scene
described as “A corner of the Gaol Yard,
Norfolk Island,” where a voice puts the dim
and ghostly lags through their Satanic cate-
chism of hate, is very dramatic. Warring-
ton is sworn in. as appointed slayer of John
Blake, after having been incited by another
convict, convincingly played by Frank Keon,
to join the Ring. Keon’s part is easy-
enough, whereas the part of Warrington, who
starts by masquerading as a Brummagem
Beaucaire, pinching ear-rings from Mrs.
Blake’s ears to
gratify artistic
pride in his old
skill, and then de-
teriorating into a
savage animal
through the aus-
tere malignity of
Commandant
Blake, would come
hard on an experi-
enced actor.
Young Alan Mur-
ray shows more
than one spark of
real histrionic
talent in his per-
formance, and
looks _ likely to go
far if he means
theatrical business.
The structure of
the story is sup-
plied by Alan,
Keon, George
Dawe iu the name
part, Isabel Hand-
lay, and a bright
little kiddie who
innocently adds
“God damn John
Blake” to her even-
ing prayer. Dawe

personal appearance and manner, but
no strength in his polished diction. The
author gives him no idea as to whether he
ought to suggest an absolutely brutal mar-
tinet, like the real Captain O’Hara who
served Marcus Clarke as model for his
his Maurice Frere, and the Price who was
righteously murdered by sufferers from his
tyranny at Williamstown, or whether he is
naturally a self-respecting John, beloved by
his colorless wife. Miss Handley’s sketch
of the wife throws no light on this question.
Leo burke, C. H. Row, Charles Doherty and
pretty Hilda Bull (who needs to hold her
head up instead of looking at the boards), are
promising in minor parts, whilst G. R.
Roberts tries hard to look happy in an Eton
jacket. The pretence of scenery is rather
painful, the orchestra of three auite pleasing,
and practice is bound to have improved a
second performance, due this (Thursday)
night.

“The Trap,” now in motion at Hoyt’s, Mel-
bourne, affords a close-up of Canadian back-
woods r-r-revenge flaming in the eyes of a
trusting Frenchman. The cause of the dis-
turbance is the usual adventurer whose Past
is full of dates with simple maidens. Science
will be interested in the case of amnesia
featured in “The Other Woman,” but the
neurotic flapper who is looking for a gasper
will probably fall asleep over “Love Without
Limit.” The Majestic is advertising the
audacious achievements of one Sansone in a
snecially-built film, “The Acrobat of Death.”
Also there is a diverting study of the natural
kid m bchool Days, with the clever infant,
Wesley Barry, as Master of Mischief. At
the Melba, is Marion Davies in “Beauty’s
Worth,” while our old friend Lydia Yea-
mans Titus gives an exhibition of a Quakeress
soaked in gin. At the Britannia Clara Kim-
ball Young is the same old Eve in glorious
raiment in an emotional spasm, “What No
Man Knows.”
If the Twenty Melbourne Painters invited
some of the orthodox artists to contribute to
their latest show for the purposes of compari-
son, they have succeeded divertingly in their
aim. Even the work of George Bell, who
is the best of the outsiders, seems hollowly
decorative and superficial beside the uncom-
promising but convincing canvases of A. E.
Newbury, C. Hampel, W. Rowell, and other
young realists of the Meldrum school. Bell’s
landscape of sheep moving under shimmery
trees is as pretty as a picture-postcard,- but
its second-rateness is advertised as soon as it
is contrasted with Newbury’s “Winter Sun-
light,” for example. In this achievement we
get a brilliant exposition of tone relationship.
The trees are real, and depth and atmosphere
are perfectly conveyed. There is the same
extraordinary veracity in “The Lagoon,” by
the same painter. The accuracy of represen-
tation, gives the simple, unassuming scene a
curious dignity and charm. C. Hampel is
not so great a performer. He pictures the
right lights in “The Grey of Autumn Even-
ing,” but his vision isn’t so sure in his pano-
ramic landscapes. “Grey Day” is the most
appealing of W. Rowell’s efforts, and E. Fin-
lay deserves an honorable mention for his
treescape, “Keysborough.” Miss A. M. E.
Bale demonstrates her stark naturalism in
her portraiture. The study of the lady, who
is unaccountably called “The Puritan in
I'ink,” is as impressive as the glimpse of the
elderly scientist caught in a moment of micro-
scopic research. W. Frater’s portrait of his
wife has a gleaming vivacity. It has a
strange holding power beside George Bell’s
nearby impression of a fashionably-dressed
woman sitting erect in her closely-corseted
decorum.

Collet Dobson “produces,” and the support
is good ; in fact, the players consistently strike
one as being better than the material they

little play. The Walter George co. is end-
ing its long season at this house. At West’s,
on. the screen, is Pauline Frederick in the
gloomy “Madame X,” and a ukulele turn
gives variety. The York has had a great
Australian week with a Rudd’s “Selection”
film, but now switches off to “Shame,” a
powerful study of cross-breeding, which was

Members .of Parliament. At the Grand,

More from “L.” .
Thea Proctor is obviously right in saying (B.
10/8/ 22) that broad-mindedness is an essential of
art criticism. The world would not now be suffer-
ing a deluge of freak art if there were more critics
sufficiently bread in outlook to judge a picture, not,
as is generally done, by canons of its particular
school but by basic principles to be discovered in a
broad survey of art-evolution. Artists would be re-
minded oftener, in that case, that art in any medium
which does not deal fully with the three dimensions
is doomed to oblivion sooner or later. The simple
reason is that the great realists Velasquez, Rem-
brandt and Corot, to name but three, taught man to
know a greater sum of visual truths than he had
previously encountered, with the inevitable result
that he is now unconvinced by a statement
of less. The chief aim of art from the begin-
ning has been to record things seen. Primi-
tive man gave all he knew here in a crude
statement of the symbol “oiKl.ine.” Color was
noticed next, and similarity became slowly more com-
prehensive. The realisation that outliiie was a visual
untruth gave birth to shading and the discovery of
tone, and so made possible a statement of the other
and equally important half of form, “depth, ’s, and a
full statement of color. Centuries passed, however,
before the value of these last discoveries was fully
realised. It was Velasquez who gave the world
art’s first close approach to a re-creation of life.
Since flatness is present to some extent in all pic-
tures, but nearly absent from a few by the greatest
painters, Miss Proctor’s claim that the charm of
Chinese, and some other forms of art, lies in flat-
ness, suggests a new valuation of past failures. Thus
Leonardo Da Vinci’s contrivances to conquer the
air, like many later inventions along the same lines,
had one outstanding virtue: they refused to fly.

“The Peep Show” goes on its glittering,
eye-filling, ear-arresting career at Sydney
Royal. It’s full of change, and there is
plenty of sparkle in it, even if there is a
stretch or two of flatness. An appetising
olla podrida of entertainment is “The Peen
Show.”

Hugh Buckler, well and favorably known
in Sydney as a sound actor, is at the Lyceum
as a flickergraph Indian officer. The sensa-
tional story in which he figures is based ou
Ethel Dell’s “The Place of Honor.” Gloria
Swanson, the latest in vamps, is featuring
in “Her Husband’s Trade-mark” at the same
address. “Saturday Night,” at the Globe,
starts out on its long journey as “The
Sheik’s” successor. It should commend it-
self to the graduates of- “Deadwood Dick”
literature. “My Boy,” at the Rialto, depicts
young Jackie Coogan fleeing from the
IJ.S.A. Immigration Department. The item
that draws the crowd is “A Virgin Paradise”
at Hoyt’s—a volcanic eruption, in which all
but a little girl perish. Additional on this
programme is Eugene O’Brien in a Selznick
production, “John Smith.”
“Nella”: Gus Neville’s pretty daughter
Dorothy is doing well under the Firm’s
house-flag. At present she is one of the slick
dancers in “The Naughty Princess,” at Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne. Dad continues to
fret his hour with Allan Wilkie in the fervid
North.
“Thorold Waters”: I believe the Com-
monwealth to be afflicted with more perpe-
trators of noise by xylophone—which is
4. collection of bits of wood that flatten the
pitch and can never by any possibility be in
tube —than any other part of the globe. The
reason may be that the less patient nations
have grown so tired of their xylophonists
that they have hurled the accursed musicians
upon Australia as a last resort. No variety
show here is considered complete without a
xylophone, and the torturous bunches of fire-
wood even chase you round to your pet cinema.
Usually'- the players are fairly old things
pretending to be very young, and the intent
seriousness with which they devote themselves
either to the overture from “William Tell”
or “Poet hnd Peasant” is really worthy of
some higher aim—bottle-ohing for example.
What drag's, these young-olds down to their
detestable occupation is a thing I fail to
understand. \ Had their mothers employed
some of the void lengths of timber that they
use to' spank them with, the treatment would
have benefited \this country considerably.

“Archivist”: John F. Sheridan denied re-
peatedly the allegation, lately revived, that
he was a Jew. He always said that he was
born in America, “of poor but Irish parents.”
Sheridan admitted his big nose, but argued
that a man might have big feet and not be
a policeman.
“Cornstalk”: Charlie Wheeler (B.
3/8/’22) began his stage career as a super,
with Bland Holt. Afterwards lie did odd
jobs about the office, was made assistant
stage-manager, and became s.-m. when Harry
Norman stepped down. Wheeler draws and
paints as well as writes. He studied at
Melbourne National Gallery under Fred Mc-
Cubbin. "Two of his fellow-students were
George Coates and James Quinn.
“F.L.H.”: “Archivist” asserts (B.
3/8/’22) that Booth’s Theatre, New York,
with which Dion G. Boucicault was con-
nected, is “now run by Australian O. P.
Heggie.” It is impossible. The playhouse
in question passed from Booth’s control in
1874, and in 1883 or thereabouts it was
demolished.- The site is now a business
block. Heggie must be showing somewhere
else.
“Norbell”: What hasn't Nellie Stewart
done in the way of mumming? Shakspeare,
grand opera, tragedy, » comedy, burlesque,
comic opera—she \yould exhaust old Polo-
niums “tragical-copiical-historical-pastoral”
inventory. Of course, Nell has starred in
the , pictures; and now she has accepted a
very tempting fee to speak a piece at the
Globe Theatre, Sydney, as a prologue to the
movie labelled “Over the Hill.”
“Second Murderer”: Doris Gilliam and
Herbert Millard, of Marie Tempest’s late
co., have decided to break into vaudeville.
They open at Melbourne Tivoli on Saturday,
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Ed. Ford, owner of the largest mouth in the
world, demonstrates Us capacity for
holding golf balls.
August 19, iu the first of a series of comedy
sketches from Norman Campbell’s pen, the
opening explosion being “Well, I’m !”
It sounds percussive, at any rate. Doris
Gilhain was Lottie, the cook, in “Good
Gracious, Annabella!” and Mrs. Mulhol-
land in “The Duke of Killiecrankie.” Mil-
lard was Marie’s s.-m.
“Billy T.” : The .flaring light sign informed
you that the Union Jack Variety Entertainers
were raging within, and a gentle spruiker re-
minded passers-by that the fee was a bob,
but the fact excited small public concern. In
fact, the Union Jack Entertainers were the
worst of a bad lot, and their entertaining in
places suggested the mysteries of the Spanish
Inquisition. It was about 9 o’clock when a
couple of street singers, man and wife, ac-
companied by an urchin who rattled the tin,
prowled up and pitched in front of the high
hall, singing “Under the "Weeping Willow
Tree,” a shrill tenor and an even shriller
soprano. Came the gifted manager to them,
red with righteous anger. “Go ’way!” he
cried. “Go ’way ! Go ’way ! What do you
mean by singin’ here right in front of my
show? Go ’way! Go ’way!” “Yes,” said
a bystander, “go away—you are emptying his
theatre.”
“Norbell”: I agree with “0.K.” (B.
10/8/’22) that a telling nom-de-greasepainb
is half the battle. The stage-name should be
unusual, striking and easily remembered.
Your Clarence d’E. Smytheson-Howler may
look imposing on the programme, but no one
ever remembers the owner for five minutes.
In the simple annals of the stage from the
Restoration to David Garrick (a splendid
name), Nell Gwynne, Colley Cibber and Anne
Bracegirdle are easily recalled. The Dion
Boucicaults, Boothroyd Faircloughs, and
George Titberadges of our stage have cum-
bersome but unusual titles. Hayden Coffin,
Sarah Bernhardt, Beerbohm Tree, D’Oyley
Carte, George Rignold and Alfred Dampier
—there is an arresting twist in each of them.
John L. Toole had a good name. So have Oscar
Asche, Hilda Spong and Marie Tempest.
Much of Muriel Starr’s popularity was due
to her easily-remembered “monniker.” But
the gem of all stage-names, comprising
brevity, simplicity, oddity and subtle sugges-
tion, is that of our old friend Bland Holt.
“Gregor”: “Nor-
bell’s” circus-pro-
prietor (B. 3/8/’22)
who objected to his
daughters “looking
like play-actresses”
is anything but
rare. All the circus
peonle I have
known —and I once
travelled with a
big outfit—had no
use for their
brother-entertainers
of the stage, whom
they regarded, as
monsters of in-
iquity. These
knights and dames
of the sawdust-
ring are a thrifty
and industrious lot.
They earn good
money and bank it
regularly, which is
why a dead-beat
circus performer is
as rare as a frog
with feathers.
There is no non-
sense about the
pretty ladies who
look so entrancing
in tights. For the
most part they are
the daughters, sis-
ters or wives of
gents, employed
about the circus,
and are models of
propriety.
George Gee in “The
Naughty Princess, al
Her Majesty's,
Melbourne.
A “Parlor, Bedroom and Bath” reflection :
Our expectations oft are squashed
When plays like this we get,
Since actresses are never washed,
The lookers-on get “wet.”
“C. Ockney”: London Prince of Wales’s
Theatre, where “Dorothy” was transferred
after its lukewarm reception at the Gaiety
<m its first production in England,' is not
identical with “The Old Dust Hole,” as “Nor-
Irell” states (B. 27/7/’2’2). It was the older
Prince of Wales’s, in a street off the.Tottenham
Court-road, that at one time bore the title.
There it was the Bancrofts started in man-
agement. The present building is in Chandos-
st-reet, which runs into Leicester-square, and
when first opened was known as the Prince’s.
“Dorothy” ran there for a long season, dur-
ing which its proprietor, B. ,1. Leslie, was
busy building bis own theatre (the Lyric, in
Skaftesbury-avenue) out of the profits. The
site of the “Dusthole” Prince of Wales’s was
later acquired by a certain Dr. Distin Macl-
doeks, who erected on it the most beautiful
and most unfortunate playhouse in London —
the Sea la.
“Philm Up” : Patrons of the movies have
a neat method of giving dud pitchers the
bird. The futility of hissing screen shadows
having been borne in upon them (though a
popular leading-man often gets a round of
applause on his entrance), they vent their
disapproval by ironic hand-clapping. An-
other case of “a bird in the hand.”
“BlackfriaTs”: I am becoming increasingly
curious to know who Madame Lily Payling
is, that she should score so richly with the
Australian cablemen in the Mirk. Lily
adopts the age-old device of booming herself
witn big charity concerts in such places as
the Albert Hall: she keeps us waiting
breathlessly for cable news of her re-
covery from a dangerous illness: and now
she is one of the singers at a stunt-
ing Daily Mail wireless concert. The
average well-established prima donna would
have given her garters 10 years ago
for half the attention. It is not as though
wireless concerts are .now a novelty. Nearly •
two years ago I listened in from Switzerland
on a vocal and instrumental programme by
artists assembled in Colchester, England. If
Madame Lily is delivering the real vocal
goods in the right kind of British market,
why on earth don’t the cablers tell us so
instead of confining themselves to the other
side of her work?
“M.P.A. (London) : Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
home, No. 5 Great Newport-street, W., is
now the headquarters of a moving-picture co.
But the movies are everywhere these days.
The old Canterbury ’all, over Westminster
Bridge, is housing pitchers with three
variety acts thrown in. The show is won-
derful value for the money—9d., Is. and
Is. 6d., including tax. Uniformed gents
parade the theatre and request order. If
they require assistance Australia’s old friend,
Gunner Moir, sometime heavyweight bruiser
(he whipped Petali Felix in Sydney) and
wrestling partner of George Ilackenschmidt,
is there to supply it. The Gunner is front-
of-house manager, and is indeed “a mountain
of moving brawn.” He goes to scale aC
17 stone. '
“J.F.H.” (London) : As I write George
Tallis and Hugh Ward, long-time /fel-
low-partners in the J.C.W; co., but
.uow strenuous competitors, are prowling
about the West End in search of plays
and players for" Australia. Tallis, who
lias secured the Australian rights of
“The Lady of the Rose” and “Whirled into
Happiness,” both London successes, told an
interviewer that “Australia is largely de-
pendent on the mother country for actors,
and authors too.” To which it may be
retorted that hitherto he and his fellow-man-
agers have given precious little encourage-
ment to Australian dramatic authors. Pos-
sibly the present keen rivalry between Tallis
and Ward may result in one or other taking
a few sporting risks in the production of
pieces by Melbourne or Sydney playrights,
instead of slavishly relying on London.
“0.K.”: Eily Malyon is a daughter of
Agnes Thomas, who appeared here at a
memorable time. Agnes was leading lady
to the original Dion Boucicault in his Irish
dramas. Afterwards she played heroine
with a company which Williamson, Garner
and Musgrove formed when the actor-drama-
tist had departed. Anson, Alfred Maltby,
George Titheradge and Agnes Thomas, in
“A Night Off,” were an unforgettable quar-
tette. The lady played the daughter of an
artless provincial scholar. (Maltby) who
had been bluffed by a travelling, showman,
(Anson) into supposing that'the battered
“Vincent Crummies” in question woflld
stage his Early Roman tragedy in all seri-
ousness. Titheradge had the part of a
young fellow, a Nicholas Nickleby, who had
joined the barnstormers, and his scene with
the lady who corrected his errors in Roman
history was as humorous as his -interview
with Anson re the sudden indisposition of
the showman’s wife, cast for the part of
Tullia, a Roman matron. Tullia was to
have rushed in at a critical moment of
the tragedy with an all-important scroll.
Anson decided that a new character, an in-
fant phenomenon, to be billed as “Tully,
a Child,” should serve as scroll-bearer. But
Tully also took ill, and then Titheradge sug-
gested that the scroll had better be “dis-
covered,” lying in the centre of the stage.
The tragedy was reported to have been such
an awful thing when it came to light that
even the provincial audience howled it off
the stage, and, presumably, Agnes Thomas
and Titheradge plighted their troth after
the catastrophe. But one doesn’t remember
the whole of a rattling good farcical comedy
after 35 years or so.
“Deadehead”: Shaw isn’t the only drama-
tist who believes in mounting the soapbox
to boost his wares. When the “Lass o’
Laughter” showed signs of fizzling out in
London the authoress, Edith Carter, and
half-a-dozen girl friends paraded .the West -
End with sandwich-boards marked “5.0.5.”
The stunt proved successful, and Alfred Butt
kept the play on. ‘.‘Lass o’ Laughter” is a
comedy of the “Peg o’ My Heart” type,
and was built with all the proper ingredients
of a long run. But it looks as if popular
dramatists are literally coming down into
the gutter to draw a crowd.
“D.do” : Australia has one male imperson-
ator who took peculiar pains to perfect her-
self m her art. For a year or more before
taking definitely to the stage, and when
herself a youngster of IS, she lived, dressed
and worked as a boy. - Slie even lived in one
household for over five months without
awakening a doubt that she was anything
but what she pretended to be—a particularly
bright boy. She wore a boy’s clothes ancl
did a boy’s work, and played a boy’s part
whatever was going, and now that Miss
Ipffie Fellows is male-impersonating for a
living at the Tivoli and in other places, she
confesses it is a comparatively simple matter
to carry off a male character on the stage
where the suspicion that you are not what
you pretend to be involves no disaster and
no trying disclosures. In fact, on the boards
a female_ impersonating a male would not
be anything to speak of if the imposition
were not fairly obvious.

agement, “we’re:
old married folk.
Our youngest girl

1 !u' li ephe r d s

the clever duo got the “bird.”
“M.P.A.”: The elephant has been the
cause of more accidents in the circus than
an y other animal, Jumbo, always repre-
sented in the schoolbooks as a docile old
creature, is often a malevolent brute. Such
is the considered judgment of Mrs. Reeve
Sanger, a daughter of the late “Lord” George
Sanger, whose Margate menagerie was
known to every Cockney 30 years ago. The
Sanger family, by the way, is now settled at
Ramsgate, where Mrs. Reeve runs the Palace
lbeatre. ...Here Bert Bailey wrestled with

Lhyllis Neilson-Terry, daughter of Fred
Terry and Julia Neilson, is the sloppy wench
with the bare feet, who has a habit of burst-
ing into “Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt.” She is
probably better suited to the part than any-
one since Mrs. Dorothea Baird Irving made
her one and only hit in it. Lyn Harding,
usually, a very gentlemanly mummer, falls
away from grace this time, and tyrannises
and hypnotises Miss O’Ferrall with almost
the sinister exaggeration of Tree himself.
“O.K.’s” appreciation:—
The scheme of the Nigel Brock Dramatic Stock
Company should appeal to the sympathies of habitual
theatregoers, young and old. A paragraph in the
prospectus explains the nature of the Stock:—
How often one hears—“ Why don't they nlav
such pieces te ‘Dandy Dick,’ ‘Second Mrs. Tanqueray,'
and ‘The Village Priest,’ like Brough and Boucicault !
used to give us?” Well, that is just what the
Nigel Brock Dramatic Company is going to do, at
very reasonable prices.
About 40 comedies and dra-ihas of ancient, and
comparatively recent, popularity are listed as being
available for production, provided the management
can get a guarantee of special public support. The
number of subscribers is limited to 500, at £5 13s.
Bd. per head. For this each season-ticket holder
will get a book of 26 double tickets for the best
seats in the house, which can be hooked without
fee, one double ticket for each play. Twenty-six
plays are to Be produced in as many weeks, so the
cost will pan out at 2s. 2d.- for each ticket. If with
■this guaranteed measure of support the quick-change
show succeeds in drawing the outside public it will
yield a good profit, permitting of a partial, or whole,
refund of the subscription, not to mention the
possibility' of subscribers furthermore drawing a
dividend from the 50 per cent, of profits dedicated
to that holy cause. The hope of obtaining free
entertainment for 26 weeks, plus a share in the
profits, is a sweet dream for any provider of £5
13s. Bd. to go to bed with. Seeing that a subscrip-
tion buys two tickets per week, the inducement for
two young men, or maidens, to go “whacks” in the
investment is really tempting. Nigel Brock and
J. L. Goodman are the business heads of the enter-
prise, while George Bryant, who knows the stage
game from practical experience, is to direct affairs
behind the curtain. The scheme will (d.v.) get
its send-off in Melbourne, at the Playhouse, in the
middle of November, the theatre being leased for
26 weeks. Regarded as a winter scheme it would
look highly unpromising, but in pleasant weather
the Playhouse, a-nigh the Yarra, is a satisfactory
proposition.
HENRY THE HANDY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was a barman, but, because
Too large were Henry’s hands
For glasses delicate as straws
And valuable brands,
They sent the hapless man adrift
For bread and meat and bed to shift
At jobs where hands to fill a ’bus
Might be quite ad-van-ta-ge-ous.
Poor Henry’s hands were thick and square,
None larger grew on humans;
His feet’s extreme dimensions were
Excelled for space by few men’s.
And everywhere that Henry went
lie quickly from his job was sent
Some favor otherwhere to meet,
Because his hands were measured feet.
That Henry’s happy now and well
You may be pleased to know;
He’s something of a heavy swell
As usher at a show.
The managers with zest compete
For Henry’s mighty hands and- feet;
And now a steady screw he drays
For nightly leading the applause!

Loyal Irish’s easy win in the Dundas
Handicap at ltosehill on Saturday has called atten-
tion to his Epsoin Handicap chance. Carrying 71b.
more than his Epsom weight (7st. 51b.), the M.L.
chestnut jumped out briskly from the barrier and
was never headed, Reed —a smart jockey from the
Dominion, who will get a lot of mounts on this side
—riding him home two lengths ahead of the out-
sider Gilray (Bst. 121 b.), who was well clear of the
well-backed and highly-thought-of Newcastle mare
Sun Lady (Bst. 31b.). Loyal Irish had plenty of
friends at 6 to 1, and ran the six furlongs in lmin.
losec. In the unplaced division were Wish Wynne
(9st. lib.) and Paganini (7st. 121 b.), both solidly sup-
ported. This looks good form, and if the Ausurd-
Moira Machree four-year-old can keep his condition
he will run an interesting mile at Randwiek on
September 30. The question is whether he isn’t too
forward for a horse that will require to be at his
top six weeks and two days hence—his preparation is
certainly more advanced than that of anything he beat
on Saturday. Last year, after winning the Maitland
Cup on August 20, the colt went to pieces and could
do nothing at Randwiek. He may be more robust
nowadays, but with that experience in mind no
philosophically doubtful turf scribe can recommend
him for the Epsom in preference to Gilray, a proved
weight-carrier (he has Bst. 81b.), who relishes the
Randwiek straight and is capable of being improved.
No other likely-looking Spring candidates ran
prominently at Rosehill. Punch, who beat a field of
moderates in the August Handicap, will never dis-
tinguish himself in first-class company. Going out
to do his preliminary he looked the fittest horse of
the bunch, but he had run badly at Moorefield on
Thursday, and was friendless at. 20’s. Bardoleur,
who landed the Three-year-old Handicap for Earn-
sliaw, and Stony, winner of the Parramatta Mile,
are useful, but nothing more. Samuel Hordern’s
fine-looking chestnut, Wyndham (Montecello-Patri-
inony), who went wrong last year when fancied for
the Derby, started in Htony’s race and showed pace
for a few furlongs. Then his condi Covi gave out
and he finished nearer last than first.

The party behind Tolley Scott must be
sorry they didn't
nominate him for
the Metropolitan.
When the Linacre-
Waiter five-year-old
downed Fairy Bob and
Prickles in the w.f.a.
race at Ascot (Q.), on
August 5, doing the 10
furlongs in 2min.
7sec., there were those
who thought it was a
fluke. Ha proved it
was no fluke by clear-
ing out from the field
in the £lOOO Metro-
politan Handicap, run
on the second day of
the meeting, and win-
ning by six lengths in
2min. SlAsec.—record
time for Queensland
over a mile and a half.
The stable backed him
enthusiastically in both
races.
"THE COUNT." a
Fleminffton fielder.
In time that was several seconds outside
the record, Bright Maid won the Australian Steeple-
chase. On account of her easy weight and reputation
for stamina the daughter of Bright Steel and Fleet
Maid was backed down to B’s in a field of 12. only
Agar, Haoma and Mountain God starting better
favorites. Agar, who had been going in great
style, took off., too.-late at the logs- in- front of the
stand at the second time of asking, and lost his
rider. Presently Haoma took his favorite place at
the head of the field, and a doubt about his staying
right to the bitter end was all that worried his
backers. Old Doiran and Mountain God were far
behind. Resembler was tiring, and only Bright
Maid was a very dangerous follower. Haoma held his
four lengths’ lead until the last of the jumping jobs
was accomplished. But weight was finding him out,
and in the run home Bright Maid outpaced him.
Meanwhile, Mountain God, who was humping 191 b.
more than even Haoma over the four miles, had out-
lasted Oopina, and was gradually gaining on Doiran.
Thirty-three pounds was a lot to give away to the
other old sticker, but the third money (£150) was
worth battling tor, and Mountain God won it—on
the post. Eight of the 12 finished the course.
On present appearance Faithful Knight will be a
champion ’chaser in the near future. In minor events
there has been no stopping him of late, and on
Saturday the dashing chestnut made nothing of
list. Bib. With judicious handling, and good luck,
Faithful Knight is going to earn a name for himself.

“0.K.”: Judging from the dictum of
chairman Mackinnon at the annual meeting of the
V.R.C., that “We must have the bookmakers in
addition to the totalisator,” there is not much
chance of ample tote accommodation being provided
at Flemington when (or if) the machine is legalised.
Heaven only knows why we must have book-
makers. Stead became a famous breeder and owner
of racers in Maoriland without any help from book-
makers. He was much more successful than Mac-
kinnon, or any other V.R.C. committeeman, has been
with bookmaking assistance. At any rate, the days
of a reserved “ring” ought to be over when the
tote comes along. If Mackinnon must have indivi
duals to lay him the odds months before the event,
and on the day, he will always know where to find
those alleged esse, tials. Wnat the people want is
a tote which they can get to more easily than they
can reach a bookmaker during the busiest part of
Cup day.
* * * *
Vic. Premier Lawson has set apart Aug-
ust 22 for Moriey to luo.e the second reading of
his Tote (plus the Bookmaker) Bill. Bouchier, one
of the intellectuals of the Cocky party, is named
as seconder, but he is not wiidiy enthusiastic about
the measure. The debate will be largely academic,
as some of the members won’t be playing for keeps.
Unwilling to be bombarded with wowser propaganda,
as Moriey has been, the advocates of the bill have
been keeping under cover. Old hands think that
if it gets into committee it will ue side-tracked
there, and that Moriey and co. will have to do a
lot more missionary work.
“L.M.”: “Tuart,” referring to the death of
Lionel Robinson (B. 3/8/’22) and the win of his
horse, The Victory, in the 1902 Melbourne Cup,
mentions that “thenceforward white, cardinal seams
and cap were conspicuous colors on the Australian
turf.” Those colors, however, were prominent io g
before 1902, prads belonging to the late W. R. Wilson
having carried them to the front in most of the
events worth winning in several States. Wilson
was also a prominent mining-man.

“Linesman”: Patterson and O’Hara Wood
performed nobly in the doubles against the trenehmen
at Boston. By dropping the first two sets in the
singles against Gobert; on the first day (he won the
other three) Patterson suggested that he was not
tuned up to Davis Cup pitch, and it was plain
that Wood, lacking practice on account of his shoul-
der, was not the man for an encounter against two
fast volleying players like Gobert and Cochet. The
latter beat the Australian in a stirring five-set match,
which made it level pegging. Our men ran away
with the first set of the doubles. The Gauls rallied,
and seemed to have the match in their grip, with two
sets to one. Patterson and Wood averted disaster
by capturing the fourth, after the teams were 3
games all, and snatching the fifth at 10-8, after the
enemy had led at 6-5, 7-6 and 8-7. The last
session was a ding-dong battle, but the Australians
proved superior in pluck and stamina. Cochet, a boy
of 20, was the weakest of the four as regards
physique, and probably on that account bore the
brunt of the Australian attack. But all of them
must have been leg- and brain-weary at the finish.
In the tension of a close fight running to 57 games
even the usually phlegmatic Patterson must have
crumpled considerably.
Tn Monday’s matches O’Hara Wood handsomely
defeated Gobert, after losing the first set, and Pat-
terson proved too good for Cochet. The Australians
have now to meet Spain, and with Anderson back in
the team, should comfortably account for the Dons.
* * * #
“15-30”: Whatever may be the alleged
feeling betwen Patterson and Anderson, the former
is sportsman enough to recognise publiclj’ the other’s
ability. lie writes warmly of Anderson’s perform-
ance against Washer in the Belgian tie. Washer, a
recognised European champion, was easily downed by
the Cornstalk, of whom Patterson says: “It gives
me joy to say, without any qualification,” that he
played “in his greatest style.” Anderson piled up
a superlative record of forehand aces, shooting with
wonderful accuracy across court and down the side
lines, and frequently retrieving fierce slams which
the Belgian had considered winners. Patterson de-
clares that Anderson never baffled an opponent more
in the concealment of direction, whilst his service was
so brilliant, pelting along the middle line of drop-
ping into the corners, that Washer failed to reach
seven balls with his racquet, and was visibly non-
plussed by many others. Altogether, “Jimmy” was
a triumph, and his rival is kind enough to add that
“the English critics were unanimous in saying that
he is a world-beater in the single-handed game.”
Britain has discovered a promising girl
tennis-player in Kitty Mclvane. Once employed at
the headquarters of the Multiple Tea Shop in London,
Kittv learnt her game on the court provided for
the firm’s employees, and, without any coaching,
shot into notice in 1919 by winning two champion-
ships in the South of England, She fought her way
into the Queen’s Club final the same vear. Miss Me-
Kane did not go far at Wimbledon this vear, but ore-
viouslv, at Beckenham, she walloped Mile Lenglen’s
alleged rival, Sirs. Mallory, by two sets to one, and
knocked out the Californian Miss Ryan in two
straight sets, in which the Yankee only collected
four games. She is declared to be an English edi-
tion of Mile Lenglen in her activity and hitting
Eowers, but a service without bite or spin keeps
er lagging behind the French girl.
Another shock was administered to Rugby
Leaguers on Saturday, when North Sydney thudded
for tne third successive time. Western Suburbs beat
them on this occasion by 8 (2 tries 1 goal) to 7
(1 try 2 goals). All North’s points were notched
by Horder, who played at centre. Green, their rake,
fed Duncan Thompson liberally, but the champion
was below form. North led by 5 to 3 at the spell,
but afterwards they were no match for West, who
were greatly helped by their new men, Yanz, Bel-
lamy and Mendel. South Sydney retained their lead
in the City Cup competition at the expense of
Glebe, whom they defeated by 15 (3 tries 3 goals)
to 10 (2 tries 2 goals). But Glebe were unlucky,
F. Burge (concussion). McGrath and Toohey going
off during the first canto. Eastern Suburbs were
just too good for Uni., scoring 4 tries 2 goals to
3 tries 3 goals. Balmain gave St. George their usual
weekly hiding by 15 (4 tries 3 goals) to 7 (1 try
2 goals). North Sydney and Glebe still head the
premiership list with 22 points apiece, and South
Sydney are 4 points ahead of Glebe, East, West and
Newtown for the City Cup. Horder tops the scoring
list with 91 points (11 tries 29 goals).
JAMITO, the Filipino featherweight, who
is about to leave Australia.
“Pongo”: “Lexite” (B. 10/8/’22) and
others are sceptical aoout Uni. s recent successes in
Sydney Rugby League competition. lam not. In 13
matches the ’Varsity men have scored 107 points
against 232. They have Sandy Pearce and W. Kelly
coaching them, and although they have not been as
successful as they hoped, they have always given
their opponents a rare fight. As one who has been
closely connected with the League game since its
inception, I can assure “Lexite” that there is no
need of the inquiry he seeks. Football is a sport
in which luck is an important factor. The trouble
with ’Varsity is that they have had little luck,
“Wilfrido”: How’s this for a Bugger
record? Wellington (M.L.) College juniors have
played 10 matches this season, and scored 536 points,
while only 3 have been notched against them. Some
of the results run: 98-0, 93-0, 83-0, 66-0, 48-0, 38-3.
The College line has never been crossed, the only
score having been a penalty goal.

The controllers of Australian football
devoted Saturday to emphasising the fact that their
game is supreme in tour of the States, and is
making headway in the other two. One Vic. League
team visited Adelaide and played S. Aus., anotner
met N. S. Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground,
a third encountered the pick of Ballarat in the city
that used to be golden, and Fitzroy, the leading club,
took on West Perth in W.A. S.A. won the Adel-
aide match by 6 points— 7.l4 to 6.14. On the
centre line there was a grand struggle between V.
Richardson, the inter-State cricketer, and Carr, the
St. Kilda crack, and the balance of points was with
Richardson, although Carr was the better man in the
last quarter. Showing a greatly-improved standard
of play, albeit the conditions—wind, rain and slush
—were against them, the Cornstalks were beaten by
17 points—Vie., 7.17 ; N.S.W., 6.6. Ballarat were
the winners by 3 goals—l2.ll to 9.ll—but it took
Fitzroy all their time to settle West Perth, a single
point separating the teams —7.7 to 7.6 —when the
final bell rang. At Sydney a second N.S.W. side
had a win over Queensland —11.18 to 10.9.
The Bananalanders played excellently in the opening
quarter, and were superior in the third and fourth.
But in the second term N.S.W, put on 32 to nil, and
that decided the issue.
* * * #
Lots of League supporters, scenting a good
game, went to watch the Association leaders, Footseray,
demolish North Melbourne. ’Seray have lost but one
match this season, while Norths, who disappeared
from the football landscape in the middle of last
season, have had to build up a new team. This is
a simple feat if you have money, but North have
so little that their players have to pay their own
fares. ’Scray discovered that though cash can buy
stars it can’t always win games, and the smellful
suburb’s barrackers went home in a state of sur-
prised disgust, with a solid licking to think over—
-30 points to North’s 47.
* * # *
“Unley”: Jack (“Snowy”) Hamilton, who
helped his State to beat Victoria on Saturday, has
at last been granted a clearance to play for West
Adelaide. Hamilton is 22, and since 1919 has been
recognised as S.A.’s most brilliant and spectacular
player. A great sprinter, he won a 75yds. race at
Stawell (Vie.) in first-class company when only 16.
He has specialised in Sheffield Handicaps, but can
run a fine half-mil*.
r^'! ie Soccer team had a trium-
phant tour of Queensland. They won both Tests,
tne first bv 1 goal to nil and the second by 2 goals
to nil, and defeated a Metropolitan lot in'between.
The second game was on the rough side, and the
ambulance men were kept busy. Also, the ban-ackers
hooted the umpire lustily. This is a sign of the
increasing popularity of Soccer. Hitherto followers
of the Association game have been too lymphatic to
hurl insults at the umpire.
* * • .
m (Lpudon) : Though obviously on
the buily side W. S. Kent-Hughes, the Melbourne
Grammar Scnool athlete, now at Oxford, bad verv
little difficulty in winning the 440vds. hurdles at the
English amateur championship meeting at Stamford
Bridge. Hughes left his mark to tell me that exams,
had prevented his making a proper preparation, but
he won both his heat and the final without being
pushed. His time was 59sec.—no great shakes over
low hurdles. It was fortunate for him that the
holder, Cliristiernson (Sweden), did not start, as the
Swede is quite a class above the British hurdlers over
the quarter.” Kent-Hughes is the first Australian
to place Ins name on the list of champions at this
meeting, though two Maorilanders in George Smith
and H. E. Wilson have scored in the 120yds. hurdles.
Smith won in 1902, and Wilson in 1919. The out-
standing feature of the gathering was the wonderful
running of Edward, the English champion, who won
the 100yds. by a clear yard in “evens,” and also
collected the 220yds. in 22sec. and the 440yds. in
50 2-ssec. In both events he won pulling up vards
ahead of the second man. Edward, who has a strong
dash of the tar brush—he comes from the West Indies
—is certainly the most attractive amateur sprinter 1
have ever clapped eyes on.
* * * •
“Winkle”: The Hawthorn harrier Fred
Kohlman has added his second Victorian five-mile
championship to his Australasian and Victorian ten-
mile titles, which stamps him as one of the greatest
long distance runners Australia has produced. His
time, 27min. 56sec., is only 30sec. behind W. I*.
O’Neill’s record, and as Kohlman won at his east
by 150yds. he would have established new figures
had he been pushed. St. Stephen’s harriers, who
are competing in the N. S. Wales championships,
lived up to their reputation by capturing the
A-grade teams championship for the fourth con-
secutive year. They also won the B-grade event.
» * * •
There ought to be some magnificent running
in Sydney shortly if Parcell, the Queensland crack,
comes south and meets Kohlman and Sheaves. At
Brisbane on Saturday the Rocklea man retained the
three-mile championship of his State. He ran the
distance in 15mm. 41 l-ssec, and had 300yds. lo
spare at the finish. Tas Ferguson, of N.S.W., won
the 440yds. in 54 2-ssec., and J. Corrigan took the
mile walk in 7min. 44sec. The 100-yards champion-
ship went to T. Grehan, the Brisbane sprinter, but the
time was slow —10 3-ssec.
* * • •
A speedy bantam is the Sydney youngster
Les Waters, who fought Harry Gordon, of Melbourne,
at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. But Gor-
don is almost as fast, and much stronger; and he
ended up the winner of the most satisfactory scrap
seen at the Stadium for many a moon. Maters
started off at a furious pace, and sustained it aston-
ishingly. His boxing was brilliant, and his counter-
ing exceptionally clever. But in the 10th round
his stamina - started to ebb. and the tough Victorian
steadily wiped out the margin of points against him.
In the 16th round he triumphed over his 16-year-old
adversary. After Waters had been punched to the
floor for the second time the referee stopped it.
Bert Spargo, the best man in Australia at
his weight (9st.), is seemingly getting tired of let-
ting his opponents go 20 rounds with him. In
recent fights the Victorian has brought into play his
long-mislaid knockout punch, with melancholy results
for the other man. At Melbourne on Saturday Spargo
stopped Kramer, the. latest U.S. importation, in 10
rounds. Kramer was plucky, and took a dreadful
hiding with stoical composure, but he never had a
hope. In his present form Spargo would be a match
for Criqui or any other featherweight in the world.
* * * *
Judging by Hughie Dwyer’s brilliant box-
ing against Bradley at Brisbane last week, ihe
lightweight championship should be liis when lie has
finished with Godfrey. Bradley beat the latter all
the way, but against the more scientific Dwyer the
rugged Gympie boy never looked like winning. His
fierce swings were artistically ducked or blocked,
and he stopped most of Dwyer’s hooks and uppercuts
with his body. Popular as Bradley is, no one
cavilled when the decision went to the spare Sydneyite
at the end of the 20th. .He was thoroughly entitled
to it; and he only wants a k.o. punch to rank with
the great boxers of 25 years ago.
* * * *
“M.P.A.” (London) : If Australian George
Cook possessed anything akin to a punch he would
have put Canadian “Soldier” Jones to sleep in
short time at the Holland Park Rink, London, on
July 10. Jones is built somewhat on the lines of
Bill Squires, without the sneed and hitting power
of Australia’s old slogger. By avoiding wild swings
and a vicious stab with the left, Cook gradually
piled up points and got the decision. Had it not
been for the antics of the Canadian it would have
been a sorry 60 minutes’ show, and until he tired
he displayed some attitudes reminiscent of Jerry
Jerome and a Maori haka. Jones left himself open
as a book. Time and again he turned hjs back on
Cook and walked away, the Australian having neither
the speed r.or the faculty to cope with the situation.
And so the rounds dragged on. After seeing Cook
in action against Carpentier, the master craftsman,
and Jones, the Canadian bushwhacker, 1 am quite
satisfied that George is a lucky youth to have clicked
the matches he has got in England. The easy money
some boxing duds get these days is enough to make
the old-time stoushers turn in their coffins.

Two inter-State baseball matches were
played on Saturday. N.S.W. beat Victoria, at Syd-
ney, by 3 runs to 2. Alan Kippax, the cricketer,
got the winning run, streaking home after a fine
hit from James’s bat had been taken by left-field;
and 5000 “fans” cheered him madlv. Mitchell’s
great fielding was a feature of the game. The Vic.
crack dragged down three wonderful “flies.” In
one case he ran backwards half the length of the
field and then grabbed the ball left-handed. There
was little between the rival pitchers, Robison
(N.S.W.) and Malcolm (Vie.). In Melbourne a
second Vic. team beat S.A. by 12 runs to 11 after
the Growwiters had led 11 to 6.
THE SPORT OF KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“After a Marriokville-Mascot Ruguy League foot-
match last Saturday, a crowd of supporters of
both teams chased the referee. The latter just
mai aged to beat his pursuers to the pavilion and
locked himself in a dressing-room till the police
arrived.” —Sporting item.
They have no antlered stag at Marriekville
To spring when wanted from his dewy lair,
And lead an eager hunt o’er dale and hill;
They cannot even chase the fox or hare,
Or on the bounding ’roo exert their skill —
Such fauna are not there.
For sportsmen who would sweep across the lea
Whooping in artless venatorial glee
The only quarry is a referee.
Behold the barrackers, their breasts aglow,
Their eyes aflame with ardor of the chase!
What keener joy can England’s thrusters know
Who top their bullfinches with easy grace,
While Pytchley echoes to their tally-ho,
Or some bucolic place
Whence jovial Jorrocks rode with Pigg afield,
Or Soapy Sponge his rare resource revealed,
Or Facey Romford lived and loved and spieled.
Now Marriekville to Melton seems akin,
The human Reynard runs with hanging tongue.
God I Will .he make his point? He’s ’most all in,
Soon will the snapping pack on him be flung 1
On with the chase! Sure, never faster spin
Than this Whyte Melville sung.
Yoicks 1 Tear him ! No, he’s safe across the hill 1
Ah, well 1 The staunchest hounds can’t always kill,
Either at Melton or at Marriekville.

For the sake of the Australian Steeple-
chase at Caulfield on Saturday, no one
seemed to mind the weather. The rain
Avashed the whole scene to a brilliant clean-
liness. The Flat was a picture of little lakes,
tawny grasses and green shrubs, and even
the huddled people lent an effective spLtsk
color. But the la\A T n Avas severely dull Avith
the greys and browns of men’s togs. Women
deserted the parade and huddled on the
grandstands. Still, one or tAvo of the men
livened up the dull coating. “Lockie” Mac-
kinnon shoAved a delicate lavender suede i T est
and blue-lavender pants under his tight-
waisted overcoat, and a well-known figure on
thg Block had a couple of dozen blue corn-
flowers in the buttonhole of his pale grey
tAveeds. Womenfolk, of course, put away
all thought of their neAV Spring clothes, but
they brightened up fur wraps Avith brilliant
headgear. Mrs. Reg Clemments topped off
Avith peacock green and gold, and Mrs. Theil’s
cerise A’elvet toque made a brave note in her
•navy blue frocking. Mrs. Buchanan AA’ore
a big collar of black and tawny white fur
on her overcoat. Mrs. Jess Fairbairn Rus-
sell was muffled up in a huge motor-coat,
but her head sported a mandarin-like tawny
and gold affair. Mrs. Brunton affected
leaf brown, and had some fashion-
ably “drenched” feathers in her broAA’n toque.
Mrs. Jack Winter Irving Avas snug and trim
in a short black mack, tightly belted at
the waist. Mrs. Manifold showed a rich
orange turban above her fur coat. The popu-
lar knitted avool frock had a great innings,
and was worn with business-like hats deco-
rated Avith woollen flowers. Miss Stead Avas
in a cute nigger-broAvn rig. Mrs. Woodforde,
in the committee box*, stuck to her consis-
tent fancy for fawn colors and brown. Mrs.
Norman Wilson, in black, stuck a brilliant
turquoise feather in her cap; and Mrs. John
Mills, in a dark cloth suit, wore a brilliant
turban of jade, blue and crimson. Mrs. G.
Blackwood’s frock was a heavy cloth smartly
trimmed with fur. Mrs. Alan Currie put
bright pink facings on her broAvn suit and
hat. Mrs. Higinbotkam backed Master
Vibrator in the Balaclava Stakes because of
a dream, and her friends were wild with dis-
gust at their previous unbelief. Poor old
Sam Mackay—seriously ill in Westralia —-
had a Avin with Yanda, and his Avife and
daughter were too busy nursing him, to be
there to see the race.
Una Bourne’s concert Avas dominated by
Melba, as a matter of course, gentle Una
not being of the dominating sort. When her
patroness took the platform, a picture in
gauzy pale apricot and gold, the Town Hall
hailed its queen in the usual manner, and
her gracious contribution of a group of
songs led naturally to the three encores
which were her gracious limit. The Dame’s
trills may not be —in fact, they certainly
are not —the string of pearls she used to
play with. The day of her top-note is done.
But the beauty of her middle register re-
mains- to tell the tale, and Avhen she grieA’es
the liigh-brow criticism by warbling “Se
Satan Rose” the multitude just adores the
sweet breeziness of it. Apart from the en-
core numbers Melba threw in a pretty pro-
fession of her love for Una Bourne, and
delight in being there to help. Una played
second heroine, and shared the feast of
rtoralties, in graceful gossamery frock fin-
ished with pastel pink roses. At the key-
board she had some of the times of her life,
though the programme might have been more
varied in effect. There was a clever little
nocturne for the left hand only, and the
“Appasionata” and the “Death of Isolde”
(“Tristan”) and other things, more quaint
and daintily performed than winsomely
melodious. One would have preferred to
hear her in a programme more in harmony
with her personality.
Luckily there is no union for artists’
models or for such as draw paint or model
from the life; so the Saturday-afternoon
Life School at the Y.A.S. Galleries has been
revived, and members are invited to come
along and get tAvo or three hours’ fi’ee study
of draped humanity on Saturdays, instead
of considering limb-outlines at football-
grounds. A fresh model will be provided
each Saturday. In the financial interests
of art, the Y.A.S. should petition all
good popular subjects for portraiture
and caricature to do a Saturday-afternoon
turn at posing. Why not a few special Wil-
liam Hughes or Walter Kirby stunts on the
school platform? The trouble with Hughes,
though, would be that “volunteered opinion
or criticism is absolutely barred” by the
rules of the game. One can hardly imagine
the Priminister refraining from violent com-
ments on the work of any artist who saw
him as he doesn’t see himself.
Society is slipping back to the simple
games of olden time —a reaction, probably,
to the feahfully expensive orgy of poker
that it has been indulging in. At Mrs.
Albert Miller’s housewarming party the
other night they slew’ Time by guessing the
number of peas in a bottle. Meta Power
was triumphant, and bagged a silver cigar-
ette-box as a prize. But why wasn’t the
trophy an embroidery frame or a thimble?
A doctor ordered Mrs. A. G. U. Richard-
son back to her home climate in South Aus-
tralia for the worst of the winter months,
but the energetic lady refused to let in-
validism put aside her wonderful work for
charities. She gave a song recital in the
Adelaide Town Hall on July 20, to aid the
proposed Moonta Jubilee Hospital, and
handed in a cheque for £l3B. Mrs. Rich-
ardson Avas formerly Miss Lilian Lucas, and
appeared often in Adelaide on the concert
platform. She has a rich mezzo-soprano
vbice. I-ler husband is also a South Aus-
tralian, but he now superintends the Agri-
cultural Department in Melbourne, and lec-
tures on biology at Melbourne ’Varsity.
Captain Nigel Somerset, who married our
Fifi Urwin has gone to Cologne in charge of
a section of the British Army of Occupation.
Fifi had a great time in London on her
honeymoon, and she was presented at Court,
under the wing of Lady Weigall, just before
she left England.
Lorna Embling, daughter of the late H. A.
Embling, has joined forces with Norma Col-
lins, and the tAvo girls are planning to run
a riding-school at Malvern. They are both
smart liorsew’omen, w’ell knoAvn in the hunt-
ing field, and Lorna and her mother were the
leading members of the Equestrienne Club.
They have some reliable hacks, and they
intend to add a few quiet ponies to their
stable.
The civic quarterly dinner happened on the
9th. Under the Swanson regime Avives are
invited to these blow-outs, the Gaud Mayor
(or his Avife) feeling that it promotes friendli-
ness in the aldermanic w’orld. A lengthy
menu was served under electrics hung Avith
huge golden bells. At speech-time Alderman
Burton said it was practically a sure thing
that Svyanson would reign for another term.
There Avas also a murmured reference to the
possibility of him being smitten on the shoul-
der by a kingly sivord. But SAvanson was
non-committal on these matters when his turn
came to speak. Mrs. Swanson, in the per-
fection of a Parisian black goAvn, led the
ladies to the drawing-room, where coffee and
much fine music were served.
Allan’s last Saturday Pop programme men-
tioned in a footnote that the next two con-
certs will have to be matinees because the
Assembly Hall is otherwise booked for the
Saturday nights. Music’s warmest friends
are getting quite keen on Allan’s pops.
They are glad to meet such revered old iden-
tities as Benno Scherek and Hattenbach,
doing solo and duet work for piano and ’cello.
Fritz Hart’s Conservatorium Choir proved on
Saturday that it is improving all the time in
part singing, whilst Marion Wainwright’s
sweet voice was charming in Elgar’s “Like
the Damask Rose,” and a bunch of simple
love-songs by Julius Harrison. Talking of
Fritz Hart’s choir, though, one has to be cruel.
Some of the girls looked as though they had
come hurriedly from the ironing-table, with-
out stopping to run the iron over their ow r n
fair selves.
Musical Adelaide is proud of Miss Maude
Puddy, pictured herewith. She trails “Mus.
Bac.” after her
name, teaches the
pianoforte at the
Elder Conserva-
toriuin, and" Ts Tier-
self a brilliant exe-
cutant, a fact re-
markably demon-
strated at the S.
Aus. Orchestra con-
cert a few weeks
ago, when she ex-
hausted the critics’
stock of superlatives
by her playing in
the Schumann Con-
certo in A Minor
for pi an 0.. an d
orchestra. And she
carried the whole
exacting thing
thi’ough without a
note ot music in trout of her! Miss Puddy
spent 14 years studying and giving concerts
on the Continent and in London. She was
under Leschetizky in Vienna, and the Great
One thought so much of her that he made
her one of his vorhereiters, or under-
teachera.
Never very sturdy, the London branch of
the A.N.A., which began with the war, must
be near its last glimmer. Nearly all those
who held the concern together are now back
in Australia, its main props having been
immigrationist A. T. Sharp, trade expert
and veterinary Cherry, Customs-man Curd,
pressman A. H. O’Connor, now r of the Sun,
and Colonel Reay, who is on his w v ay out.
The A.N.A. served a big purpose in London
w’hen it set up the Anzac Buffet for the Dig-
gers, but since that hostelry shut down most
Australians there simply couldn’t be bothered
with the talky side of the concern.
IV. M. Crougey, the virile young Ballarat
baritone, caught the ear of adjudicator Gib-
son Young at the
South-street compe-
titions in 1919 so
persistently that he
won every avail-
able triumph. Ver-
brugghen clinched
the opinion last year
b y dragging lii i m
from a compara-
tively dull occupa-
tion in Ballarat into
the limelight of a
New r Zealand tour
and numerous Syd-
n e y appearances
with the State
Orchestra. Crougey,
who vivifies most of
hi s work with
strong temperamen-
tal and dramatic
lire, entertains hopes of making the grand
tour and entering the London lists as an
oratorio and ballad singer; but his next
move is as principal baritone in a forth-
coming Melbourne mystery production. In
the meantime here he is, as the lens of
Richards, of Ballarat, sees him.
One is rather grieved than shocked to find
the Mermaids up against the Pioneers. Per-
haps that needs explaining. Lately the
Pioneer Players, who have taken the coming
Australian drama under their care, had their
first show (Louis Esson’s “The Battler”) at
the Playhouse, a place where the Mermaid
Repertory Play Society deals with the sort
of drama that has no vulgar contact with
the common public. Now, the Pioneer Plac-
ers have decided to shift to the Temperance
Hall in Russell-street, and make Thursday
their weekly night of gathering. Australian
drama is thus dedicated to the great god
Thor, and if you wish well to local manu-
facture in theatrical goods you must put your
trust in Providence and keep your Thursday
nights free. But, lo! the Mermaids block
the way somewhat. They have a prior claim
to Thursday, as the first of a three-nights’
season, and this week they are staging
“Toys” and “The Choice” at the Playhouse.
If Australian drama is to be a regular once-
a-week event it must clash occasionally with
doings at the older temple of highbrow wor-
ship. And the breast of Culture will bo torn
by conflicting emotions.
Led by Mrs. Glencross (Eleanor Cameron
that Avas) a fair-sized crowd of women mus-
tered the other day and formed a provisional
council to work for skirted legislators and
municipal councillors, it is just too late
to do anything much this year in the muni-
cipal line, as nominations have closed; so it
looks as if Mrs. Mary Rogers (Laborite), of
Richmond, will be our lone councillor. It
has been open to women to nominate for the
Federal Parliament, but few have done so,
and those who have tried it in Vic. have
been consistently among the “also rans.”
Two links with politics of the past have
just been snapped by the death of Mrs. Hen-
rietta Dobson, at Launceston (Tas.), and
of Mrs. Margaret Cussen, at Elwood (Vic.).
Mrs. Dobson was the widow of Stanley Dob-
son, LL.D., Q.C., who was in the Vic. Dreary
House from 1870 till 1895, and was Chair-
man of Committees for the last 12 years of
that term. She outlived him 27 years. The
daughter of W. S. Sharland, of' New Nor-
folk, she had associations enough with the
little isle to find a resting-place there. Mrs.
Cussen was the widow of Martin Cussen,
who was in the Upper Chamber for a while
early this century, and threw it-arp - for- a
North-Eastern seat in the Assembly.
The Australian Literature Society met at
the Stratford Tea Rooms the other night
to see, among other things, a playlet by C.
Carter (Karta). “Madame Fortuna” is a
little story with a happy-ever-after ending-
all about a fortune-teller trapped in a city
cafe and forced to reveal the truth at the
point of the teacup. The foundations are
excellent, but the dialogue lacks point and
humor, and the character-drawing could be
better; nevertheless, Carter shows some
knowledge of stage technique, so if he cheers up
his dialogue a bit “Madame Fortuna” might
get her professional chance. The curtain-
raiser, a dramatic interlude by W. Nelson,
was a smartly-written sketchlet; but the
plot was only a variation of an old story.
Mrs. E. C. Davidson read a paper on the
drama, in winch she had Peter Pan and
the Blue Bird a bit mixed up with folk-lore.
Carter aiso spoke a piece on the same sub-
ject, showing he was no admirer of Ber-
nard Shaw. (Shaw r ’s opinion of Carter is
not available at time of writing.) Dorothy
Bryan warbled two songs by Hilda Malm-
gren in a sweet tremolo which did not always
get there in the topmost notes, and Iris
Shaw, with considerable skill, released a
humorous, home-made string of loc’al anec-
dote with a fine ehestnutty flavor.
Wee Georgie Wood, the miniature Tivoli
comedian, spent a hurried Sunday with Melba
at Coldstream, and came away richer by a
tiepin, two autographed photos, and an etch-
ing of the Voice’s residence. The pin, pre-
cariously holding up a generous helping of
small diamonds, is about the rarest gift that
the diva has ever handed to a stage identity,
and the portraits of her as Marguerite, includ-
ing one specially for the youth’s mamma, are
evidence of unusual appreciation. The etch-
ing, which was much treasured by the song-
stress, is by Cyril Dillon.
Lady Novar (Munro Ferguson as was)
sends word that her niece, Lady Doris Black-
wood, has fixed up to marry Captain Cecil
Gunston, M.C., of the Coldstream Guards.
Cheery Doris, who has a whole host of girl
friends in Australia, spent the war years at
Federal Government House. She became en-
gaged while in Australia, but it only lasted
a few minutes, in a manner of speaking; then
she repeated the feat in London, but became
disengaged almost as soon.
Billy Hughes made a speech and opened an
exhibition of Australian-grown cotton at
Buckley and Nunn’s the other day. Cotton
from Victoria, N.S.W. and Bananaland was
shown. There were big fleecy masses of the
stuff, as well as little fluffy pods, and an ex-
hibit showing the various stages in the manu-
facture of the cotton as Ave know it. Society
came along and murmured with calculated
imbecility: “Really! We thought only
negroes grew cotton —down in Virginia and
Broadway and those sort of places, don’t you
know.”
The Lord Mayor formally launched the
appeal for the Broadmeadows Foundling
Horae at the Town Hall last Friday. The
committee, headed by Mrs. Benjamin Hoare,
were there in force, and pushed on the good
work among the hundreds of Melbourne
matrons who had been invited to the meeting.
There died at Echuca recently, Margaret
Jane McKenzie, wife of the McKenzie who
was once Minister for Lands and Railways.
She came of an old pionteer family, and was
the first white child born on the Wakool
River. In her childhood days the blacks
often made uncomfortable descents upon the
unwary settler and his cattle, and she could
recall many occasions when the family pre-
pared to withstand an attack. Mrs. Mc-
Kenzie, who was 76 at the end, retained an
excellent memory, and more than one writer
—the “Vagabond” among them —sought her
aid and collaboration.
Edith Swan wick, a young Bananalander,
has certainly the gift of tongues. English,
French and German she has spoken with
equal fluency from the time she could lisp.
After that Russian and Japanese were added
to the list, and only two years ago she went
to Spain to study Spanish first-hand. News
now comes that she has passed her exams,
beating all-comers in literature, and all but
two half-Spanish students in the aggregate.
Miss Swanwick was offered the job of
teacher of English in the Central School of
Languages, Madrid, but declined, as she
intends going on to Italy to make more
linguistic conquests.
A coo-ee from Adelaide: —
Last week-end took hunting men to Stiathalbyu.
It is 60 years since the pack paid its first visit
there. Those were the days when the late Henry
Downer was master. The fixture used to cover a real
week-end with lunch at The Lodge (the Lance Stirl-
ings’ hospitable home), house parties, and, a dance
thrown in; but now the hunt and the journey there
and back are tucked into one day. There is still the
lunch, though—this year at the local hotel with a
committee of Strathalbynites as hosts.
Obit , Miss Margaret Drummond, youngest daughter
ol this State’s first Presbyterian minister. She was
born at Mitcham 79 years ago.
Someone has dug up from an early history of the
State the origin of Mrs. Carleton’s “Song of Aus-
tralia.” In October, ’59, the pioneers, “while loyal
to the" National Anthem, felt the need of an Aus-
tralianjnational song.” The Gawler Institute’s offer
of a £lO 10s. prize brought 93 competitors, and
Mrs. Carleton’s was the winning entry. Meanwhile,
the fund for the proper care of her grave moves
slowly on.
The Lick Observatory’s contingent of scientists
who are to study the September eclipse descended on
us in force on Friday on their way to W.A., and
were given a hectic day of it. First a civic reception
at the Town Hall, with speeches from Lord Mayor
Cohen, Vice-Chancellor Mitchell and W. J. Sowden,
and a reply from the expedition’s leader, Dr. W. IV.
Campbell; lunch with the Commonwealth Club,
with a word or two of welcome from President
Richards and another reply from Dr. Campbell; and
an at-home at Government House —planned for the
garden, but hastily transplanted to the house, thanks
to Arctic winds and rains. The reception Tooms,
stripped of personal odds and ends, are sorry things
during the vice-regal interregnums, but the Murrays
filled up the gaps with masses of early flowering
peach, and huge bowls of wattle and purple irises—
all brought from their own garden at Magill. Local
guests were few —a couple of hundred or so at most —
and all of them more or less definitely attached to
some phases of science or education.
The estate of the late Bishop Kennion, who was
here before he went to Bath and Wells, is sworn
at £10,384. and some of it goes to his English
diocese. His wife, a sister of the Sir James Fergus-
son who was once our Governor, has money of her
own.

The Poster Ball to help buttress the. Royal
North Shore Hospital was the big charity-
dance of the week; and it drew the usual
haul of pierrots and pierrettes, butterflies,
harem ladies and gum blossoms, Shahs and
Sheiks and Cossacks. The posters were few
and uninspiring, but made tne most of them-
selves by serpentining down the length of
the room. A group of pretty girls who had
got entangled in Hillier’s chocolate-boxes, led
the poster march, made their appearance first
on the right side, then zig-zagged over to
the left, followed by the Onoto fountain-pen,
the green-wigged damosel who upheld the
honor of David Jones, the Tintex dyes, the
A.U.S.N. ladies in rather depressed-looking
flags, a striking P. and O. girl who might
have been the figurehead of a golden vessel
in some North Sea Saga, and a stream of
others representing tooth-pastes, teas and
even newspapers. Then the procession
moved again to the right, and so on. Heaven
alone knows how’ many miles they trod be-
fore reaching the base of the platform on
w’hich vantage-point Mrs. Bertie Kelly, dis-
playing brocaded tafetta and a new style in
hair-dressing, judged the sets, helped by Mrs.
Tom Dixson warmly enfolded in petunia geor-
gette. Bertie Kelly and John Longstaff were
also in the party. There was a liberal supply
of “heads” on the dais. Sir Walter and
Dame Margaret were cosily ensconced after
the band had Gorsaved three times; and the
Wade and Hay ladies, Cullen, C.J., the Alec
Thomson couple, the Mayoral twosome and
Walter Vindin, acting-president of the
North-side hospitals, shared the seats of the
mighty*.
The David Fells passed through Sydney
last week. They have just come back from
England and a visit to that half of the
peerage which is related to her; and he has
been testing the somewhat rocky foundations
of English finance. The pair now go on to
Queensland, where Mrs. David has more rela-
tions.
The latest artists snared in U.S.A. by
the Freddie Shipmans—baritone Arthur
Middleton and tenor Paul Althouse—are both
metropolitan Opera House stars. Middle-
ton is a large man, Wagnerian as to waist-
line and voice, both of which he keeps up
to condition with fearsome draughts of milk
cocoa. He has a repertory of 15 operas and
50 oratorios. Althouse claims to have
sung Samson to more operatic Delilahs
than any other tenor, dead or alive—and his
hair doesn’t look even singed ! He never
even wilted when the tropical D’Alvarez
poured her torrid Delilah notes over him. He
has made a dashing Pinkerton to the beau-
teous Farrar’s Madame Butterfly; but the
softest spot in his heart is kept for “Caval-
leria Rusticana,” beeause it was in that opera
he made his first appearance at the Metropoli-
tan. Paul has an uncle in Sydney—John
Althouse, of Edgecliff-road, Woollahra.
Another uncle is Monro Althouse, whose
musical competitions are well known i,n Syd-
ney. A cousin, Lieutenant Althouse, who
died at Bullecourt in 1918, was famous as
a boy-soprano.
It was a great idea of Dr. Arthur to let
Jackie Coogan speak for the kiddies of Sydney
at the Tivoli last week. The result was a
monster roll-up of mothers and children and
friends interested in the Sunshine Club. This
club has been formed to bring direct action
to bear in brightening up the lives of the
youngsters whose lot is cast in Surry Hills’
lanes, or amid Redfern’s smoke and grime.
Everybody who turned up at the show the
other morning bore a brown-paper parcel
having in its innards a singlet or some sort
of woolly undie for one of Dr. Arthur’s
adopted. The “little girl who had no doll”
made a star appearance on the boards, and.
although speechless with shyness, threatened
to become a serious rival to Lee White in
popularity if something wasn’t done; so
Sister Hughes handed her a dollie, and the
matinee continued.
The*recent marriage of the Earl of Drog-
heda to Lady Victor Paget (formerly Olive
May, the musicaj-comedy actress) has a Syd-
ney interest. The Earl’s sister, Lady Bea-
trice Moore, married Robin Clark, who was
a Rawson A.D.C. with Leslie Wilson for
several years. After his marriage the young
man added Kerr and a hyphen to his name
and settled in London, and going among the
first to the Great War. was killed in 1915
He brought his sweet-faced little wife to N.
S. Wales to view the ancestral squattage
shortly after their marriage. She stood by
her. brother during the ceremony the other
day, which, as both he and his bride had
been through the Divorce Court mill, was at
a registry-office.
W. A. Tainsh, secretary of the Union
Club, wrote the words of “Port o’ Sydney.”
composed by James Brash, which Chappels’
have just published. Benham included the
song in his programme at his farewell con-
cert at the Town Hall. Mr. Tainsh was
formerly secretary of the Savage Club, Mel-
bourne. He produced his own revue at the
club, and wrote the words for W. F. G.
Steele’s Australian song cycle, “By Creek
and Gully.” He was once a member of the
art colony at Warandyte, Vic., and it was
there that he met his wife, Mina Moore, a
sister of photographer May.
“We are not so remote from Sydney as we
anticipated,” writes Elizabeth Baker (Mrs.
Allaway), who has settled with her husband
at Raratonga, Cook Islands. “We are on the
wireless and get the world’s news daily,
while mailboats to and from ’Frisco call
twice a month. The orange season is upon
us, and the natives and traders are very
busy.” Miss Baker’s drama. “Alf’s Girl,” is
one of the plays underlined for future pro-
duction by the Sydney Repertory Co., which
produced her “Chains” last year.
Elizabeth, by the way, writes to London
Referee that the nice things said in her
“Chains” about Australia were mere guess-
work, which, however, has come true. “When
I wrote them I knew nothing of Australia,
and only chose it as an inspiring Land of
Hope. _ I found it on my arrival quite up to
my estimate. There is an insp ; ration about
Australia, a suggestion of freedom, which is
very fine, and I feel that all I said in
‘Chains’ is abundantly justified.”
Miss Pelletier, who has her own ways
of teaching French to small children, has
arranged a matinee to be given entirely bv
the kiddies in aid of the French Benevolent
Society of N. S. Wales. The Tony Horderns
are lending the ballroom of Retford T-Tell for
the show on Saturday next, and Sir Walter
and Dame Margaret have promised to be
front-seaters. Diana and Daphne and the
Gordon children, are members of a class
taught by Miss Pelletier.
Eileen Morgan, a little Bananaland writ-
ing-girl, whose long suit is verse-making, is
being warmly welcomed to Sydney just now
—her aunt. Mrs. Nelson, being one of her
admiring entertainers.
Mrs. Bertie Kelly is organising the Con-
tinental hair, to be held in St. Vincent’s
Hospital grounds early in October. All the
Allies are to be represented on the stalls;
and the old cries of London: “Chairs to
mend,” “Sweet Lavender” and so on, are
to materialise in comnany with characters
from grand opera. All the staunch peren-
nial supporters of the Darlinghurst life-
saving institution are backing up the
scheme; and the other morning, the meeting,
presided over by Mrs. Toohey. saw these old
friends roll up with much enthusiasm.
The special-reserve card has been put on
the Wentworth Cafe for August 20. by the
staff of the Commonwealth Bank for their
annual ball.
Herewith Marie Bentivoglio, the Italian-
Australian flapper who goes off this week
with an exhibition which entitles her to two
years at Somerville College, Oxford. She
won it by her research work in the realms
of crystallography. When she entered Syd-
ney ’Varsity on an entrance scholarship won
at Fort-street High,
Marie worked under
Professor David.
Later on (after more
scholarships), she
worked with Prof.
John Read on his
discovery of an im-
portant new essen-
tial oil in the euca-
l.vpt. The 1851 Ex-
hibition is granted
by the Royal Com-
missioners of Lon-
don, and, hitherto,
six have been given
between Australia
and Tasmania, but
this year the allow-
ance was cut down
to two owing to
economic pressure.
She takes to Europe with her some Austra-
lian diamonds —not as ornaments, but for
scientific use. She has made up her mind to
discover why an Australian dihmond is
harder than all other diamonds, and what is
the property that makes it capable of cut-
ting a Kimberley gem.
A night* or two before she left S/dney
Melba had a box at the “Great Lover.” She
had helped Ditrichstein, who created the
part in New York, to stage the first scene—
the great opera impresario’s office. Caruso
also had a hand in shaping Ditrichstein’s
part. Evidently Bennison knew of this, for
every now and again he flicked a whimsical
eyi at the Diva’s box, as if to say: “Is that
how it should be done?” What the people on
the stage didn’t know was that on the open-
ing night in New York, Caruso had shared
a box with Melba, and at the stage
where Paurel so tragically loses his
voice and listens to his youthful rival
making a triumphant dgbut in the
part, Caruso clapped his hand to his
own throat, moaning, “Name of God, it is
too much.” He is understood to have con-
ceived this neat plan of attracting the lime-
light to himself out of his own head: any-
how, his regular publicity-adviser was no-
where near at the time.
There has been such a rush on Mrs. Bur-
dekin’s book, “Anna,” that it is now practi-
cally impossible to buy a copy in Sydney or
Melbourne. It is a remarkably clever study
of an unusual type of woman; but that
hardly explains the anxiety to possess it,
which is more a matter, apparently, of a cer-
tain naughtiness in outlook, if not in deed, on
the part of the wayward heroine. The writer
is expected home towards the end of the
year.
“The Persian Garden” matinf-e netted
£Bl2 17s. 2d. for the Royal Alexandra Hos-
pital for kiddies, and secretary Clarence
Moss is expecting a big cheque from the
Grand Opera Ball in the Town Hall on the
24th of this month. The tickets for this
flutter up the social scale can be had for
12s. 6d. each. Though somewhat eclipsed
by the froth of frivolities whipped up for
the Four Arts Ball, three nights earlier, the
Grand Opera Ball has a few cards up its
sleeve in the way of decorations and gallery
attractions. Drop your money in the slot,
and Mrs. Spencer Brunton, Paling’s, and the
Australia will disgorge the tickets.
Here is the headpiece of Lindley Evans
(it would need a poster six-foot-odd to
take in all of him),
who goes off to play
for Melba in the
western and southern
States, and then sets
sail to do the same
for her in Europe.
Melba first heard
Evans playing
accompaniments for
Haigh Jackson, and
remarking “You’ll do
for me 1” straight-
way engaged the
S’Afriean for her
English tour. The
popular young pian-
ist, who, by the way,
is a pupil of Frank
Hutchens, will give
Sydney a last chance
to hear him at the
Conservatorium on the 17th.
The Science Society brewed its annual
jazz at the ’Varsity last week; and the event
of the evening was the bestowal of an im-
mense cabin trunk on the Bentivoglio lass.
The Fort-street old girls also turned on tea
and toast for her and p’led yet another part-
ing gift upon one already staggering under
an avalanche of rugs, steamer chairs,
cushions, trunks, suit-cases and sponge bags.
Mrs. Alec McVernon, whose husband is
boss of the Queensland Insurance Co.,
trimmed her reception rooms and the big hall
of lvirranda, Believue Hill, with wattle and
daffodils and bridge tables, the other after-
noon. in the interests of the Royal Hospital
for Women, Paddington. Songs at the piano,
and piano-play.ng without songs were the
spiritual refreshment of a crowded after-
noon. The McVernon household, including
Mr. McVernon’s sister and niece, sail by the
Narkunda for Eurone in March.
The Public Health Association of Austral-
asia is getting ready for its second annual
conference —the first to be held in N.S.W.
Dr. Tn by King is coming from Maoriland
to speak on infant life, and all sorts of other
experts _ will hold forth on their particular
specialties. The basic idea seems to be that
as hospital finance is becoming more frenzied
every year, the taxpayer had better learn
to keep himself well.
Eileen Shettle and Lorna Gowland are
back in Sydney after flying over half
Europe, and sampling Berlin, Vienna, Paris.
London and other effete villages of the Old
World. They report that Germany is again
busy doll-making, and its mechanical toys
are once more everything that the clockwork
nation can make them. The dolls have eye-
lashes and eyebrows and finger-nails, and
can be twisted in every joint. Clothes are
so cheap in Berlin that whole outfits can be
had for a few pounds. While in the Dry
States Eileen got caught in the eddy of the
new fad, and gave some wireless concerts.
During a recent visit of the Gilbert and
Sullivan Opera Co. to Perth (W.A.), four-
year-old Austin, son of Dr. Holland (nephew
of elocutionist Harry Leston), was taken to
“The Mikado.” Afterwards, when asked
what it was all_about, he summed it up this
way: “Well —ICo-Ko wanted to marry the
Japanese girl, but she wouldn’t have him,
and she married a man without any trousers
on.”
Governor Davidson wants to go as a
mystery to the Four Arts Ball, and the im-
pression, at the moment, in the Government
House set, is that he will turn up as a
municipal contract. At Theo Cowan’s sculp-
ture parlor in the Town Hall basement a
complete course in marble carving will be
taught on payment of £5 or 5d., and anybody
who runs out of cash will be able to pawn
his boots at the Monte de Pi£te round the
corner behind the coffee-stall in the gallery.
Pickets for the giddy shivoo are selling like
hot calces at Paling’s and the Australia for
35 bob apiece.
The W entworth seethed and frothed with
a high sea of georgette and tulle early last
week on behalf of St. Joseph’s Hospital at
Auburn. The suburbs had responded nobly
to the S.O.S. of the popular institution, and
over SOO dancers cheerfully pushed one an-
r,ound th e big room, the palm court and
the balcony. A gaily-colored caji was a part
of everybody’s outfit, and each cap carried
a number, the lucky combination “241”
unlocking a box at the Peep Show. The
Gaud Mayor and his little lady gave the
gathering a three-minute blessing on their
way out to Kensington’s dance in honor of
Mrs. McElhone’s protegee, Clarice Coles.
. Jack Higgins, Inky Wayfarer and M.L.C.,
is producing a new weekly: The Sydney
Tatlek. He has adopted, as a motto, the
witty declaration of Steele in the old Eng-
lish Tatlek; “If there’s a dull page in this
paper, there’s a design in it.”
A lady who is celebrated on two conti-
nents for her dressing was giving jazzers
at one of Sydney’s gayest cards a glimpse
of the latest in jet and tulle from Paris
and a close-up of a pair of peerless shoul-
ders the other night, when the chatelaine
of the establishment approached, and in a
horrified whisper commanded the lady to
coyer up the bare places. The visitor re-
plied with a cool stare and a supercilious
interrogation of the eyebrows. The chate-
laine became insistent. Either u portion of
the meaty display should be suppressed or
the visitor must fade out altogether. She of
the shoulders lifted them disdainfully, lan-
guorously flicked the ash from her cigarette,
stood up, picked a dragging fish-tail panel
of tulle from each side of her skirt, flipped
them crossways over her backbone, drew
them together with a postage stamp in front,
and so—“on with the dance!”
Gwen Nelson has postponed her visit
home to keep an appointment as solo-dancer
with the Greenwich Follies in New York,
a show which calls its ballet the “Leg of
Natious.” The Sydney girl says New York
has two crazes: “Blossom Time,” a charm-
ing fantasy, written around the life of
Schubert, the lyrics being set to Schubert’s
music; and feathers. The nasal village these
days is growing feathers on hats, on dresses,
sunshades, lampshades—everywhere except
on bald heads.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Government House Ball was the event of the even-
ing on the 9th. The building, once the residence of
the late John Stevenson, well-kenned in Queensland
politics, was, with its grounds, in very festive attire
for the spree. The G.-G. and Lady Forster were
among the guests, she in blue and silver. Commo-
dore Addison’s wife was resplendent in champagne
tints, and “Pamela” Pitt Rivers was also blue and
silver. Mrs. Willie Collins wore black, and Mary
Macgregor, the clever, daughter of the member for
Merthyr, was a debutante in silver lavender. Beryl
Collins, another bud, wore ivory erfipe de Chine.
Lord Digby, Col. Parsons and Capts. Pitt Rivers and
Hammond supported their Exes.
Many southerners are here, and the Q.T.C. races
in the afternoon had the biggest crowd yet seen
on a Brisbane course. Dr. Glyn Connolly and his
spouse gave a race luncheon to which Lord and
Lady Digby and Mrs. Pitt Rivers lent a reflecting
glory.
Brisbane’s head is giddy with dancing. We have
had in the one week the Hospital Ball, a mask ball
at the G. C. O’Beirnes’, the Commonwealth Bank
Ball (Jean Sholto Douglas, daughter of the manager
of the Brisbane City branch, was a deb.), the Girls’
Dance in South Brisbane City Hall (Gov. Nathan
was there), jazz afternoons, and an elaborate “Night
in Hawaii”‘arranged by Brisbane and country women.
His Ex. was also present at the last-mentioned, with
a following of Digbys, Pitt Rivers and various
captains. Jade and gold sheathed Lady Digby, and
Mrs. Pitt Rivers was in pink. Mrs. Willie Collins
put aside her whites and greys, and appeared in
coral red. Other functions of a hectic season were
the Arthur Morts’ at-home at the Bellevue, and the
Percy Walkers’ reception. Percy Walker, of Glen-
lyon, was one of three men who, years ago, were
driven by a bush-fire into the corner of a wire-fence
out west. Their horses were burned to death and
one man lost an ear.
The Governor-General, with Lady Forster at hand,
officially opened the Brisbane Show, which broke all
attendance records. Governor Nathan was on the
showground on the 10th, and witnessed an exciting
unofficial event. An 11-year-old daughter of the
Woods, of Fairview, Warra, had just won a first
prize for pony-riding, when her mount bolted, carry-
ing the child four times round the ring. She hung
on like an Australian, until Doctor, a blackfellow
who rides Judd’s jumpers, gave chase on Skyrocket
and got the pony’s bridle. Charlie Macdougall, pre-
sident, made a presentation to both the girl and
the rescuer.
During the week Southport had its own little
excitement in the discovery of an unknown wreck
at Porpoise Point, Stradbroke. Over the site of
the wreck, which lies under 40ft. of sandhill, a
honeysuckle-tree 2ft. in diameter, was growing. The
hulk is of wood, with wooden dowels and brass spikes,
and there are traces of copper on the keel, and marks
of some rude tool. The Harbors and Rivers Board
is scratching its head, but is quite unable to “place”
the old boat.

Jonick: ‘'Not Personal” doesn’t scan, and
the rhyming is poor W.J.T.W.: Nothing wrong
with method, but not enough in joke... .D.H.N.
(M.L.) : The tiger-snake injects his poison through a
hole half-way up the fang. No poison comes' from
the teeth, which are quite independent of the fangs.
. ...M.8.D.: That pen-name has an owner already.
. ...P.A. (Braidwood) : Mechanical yarns with* an
Impossible incident are no use here... .Faceplate:
Neither of them gets anywhere near... .D.F.S.: The
frosty lady is not for us... .R.11.M.: The prisoner
creaks at the joints... .Dora L.: Doesn’t move us.
Edward M.: The swimming lady might have a
sporting chance E.D. (Randwick) : “Bill” is very
crude Eunice T.: Not quite Laurence T.:
Plenty of things happen; but there is no yarn
T.C.8.: “Magic” misses.... Brandon: Try Angus
and Robertson, Sydney... .E.J.G.: No good whatever.
.... Cygnet: Moves very woodenly.... The Change-
ling : Heavy punning stuff has no chance; but you
should have real color if you wrote simply of what
is at hand....T.O. (Cessnock) : The verse is lumpy
and commonplace... .W.N.D.: Stiff and du11....
Deirdre: The mournful drunk does not move us,
though the setting is g00d... .L.J.C.F.: An old
theme ruggedly handled F.C.M.: “Nightmare”
goes wrong too often in metre Bay W.: No use.
. ...K.M.D.: “Sympathy” contains a fairly good
idea; but every line is built up of the old phrases...
Norman C.: Both miss, though the yarn got near...
Haka: A bit too thin and obvious... .Becky: Those
“Trees” have w’orked hard for so many others..'..
A. (Waverley) :It appears to be a prayer to the
sun to shine; but you’ve already stated that it is
shining J.W.S.: Far too lumpy H.W.8.: Very
rugged... .Q.P.: You can’t rhyme “visage” and
“mirage” in this paper.... Gee Bung: Something in
it: but . it’s not worked out. .. . D.L.S.: Heavy and
sorrowful mirth in horrible verse M.L. (Kilcoy) :
Very rugged stuff... J.H.S.: Closely enough observed,
but makes very poor verse Gilbert B.: Nothing
there... .L.S.: One slab of the “XVII chapters” will
do to go on with:—
My flaming heart is aching so,
’Tis broken, cru’ly battered;
My soul is smitten ; all along
My life is filled with crime and wrong
’Tis wrecked, ashamed and shattered!
I dare not look at any man,
Or woman, nor a child;
I am a sinner before God,
I’ve trodden on ruination’s road,
Thus Nature never smil’d!
I am a woman destitute,
The world does pass me by;
And wand’ring through the streets I beg,
Just for a crust, on weary leg;
I wish that I could diel
. ...A.R.F.: As dreary as a public bar after six
o’clock Pamela B.: Not for us Will K.: The
same old yarn told many times too often Richard
B. : Not our style M.A.R.: Doesn’t strike us
F.R. (Parramatta): Commonplace.... Pam: The
“Roofs” verse has the old fault of using natural
things as stage - properties-... . Dorothy B.: Very
poor verse horribly strained to get its occasional
rhymes.... F.D.: (Whangarei) : Weak little flutter.
. ...G.8.L.: None of them well enough done....
J.F.N.: No interest..! .H.G.T. : “Thou art” a dreary
person in thy use of worn verbiage and ideas....
! F.W.H.: Covers ground more closely worked by
■ another writer.... Myee: Verse bumps heavily to
state the obvious... .Jo. M.: Destroyed according to
instructions Corpusule: One “Majestic” stanza:
Ascending as the rollers roll
Meets pandemonia-hvperbole—
Furies have become cyclonic:
Barring thoughts hedonic.
. ...E.R.8.: Not up by some distance Walnut:
The one you describe as “humorous” may appeal to
our anarchist subscribers:—•
Judges and Ministers, and people with money
And respectable citizens think it’s very funny
When girls and other young men commit dreadful
crimes.
These thinkers should get their brain clear with the
times.
They think that everyone should alwavs good be.
And compare people at the standard "of what thev
should be,
To get a clearer understanding by far,
They should accept the people by what they are.
When people do things it should not be surprising,
lor there they are doing them—erime-wave- are
rising,
What should most astonish, astound and appal,
Would be if no crimes were committed at all.
South Downs: It should be easy to write a
couple of thousand lines a day of the same sort
R.F.G.: “King-street” is a long way 0ff.... Sam:
Never heard that the firemen struck because this
comestible was withheld, but will take your word
for it in consideration of the poignant beauty of
some of the lines:—
It’s money that makes the wheels go round,
The whole wide world is out for boodle;
But here we come to a fact profound—
That men won’t work without their hoodie.
Far from the madding haunts of strife
Some pass their time in a long canoodle;
But in a stern seafaring life
It’s wise to give the men their hoodie.
The steam won’t rise in the pressure gauge
(And thereby busts the whole caboodle),
It has nothing to do with the basic wage,
It’s wholly a matter of missing hoodie,
Corkscrew: Great stuff for deep thinkers:—
Wanting in knowledge in thinking not deep
We strain in the face of facts,
Knowing a few things we learned in our time
Yet fear erudite attacks;
Knowing the sea as it washes our coasts
And shrinks in the size we know,
Salter and salter becomes to our taste
To salt for grasses to grow.
Kelp and asparagus only for food
Appals to the human mind,
Spuds and tomatoes and cabbage and fruit
Refuse to be coaxed when brined.
Einstein is proving in relative way
The things as we think are not,
Proving appearances holding deceit.
Is Mars an ideal spot?

In Quarantine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COW sickness has broken out in our dis-
trict, and the Government Supervisor
has issued his decree —quarantine.
Let no clean cow wander by so much, as a
hoofs breadth lest she come back tainted.
Confiscation and destruction of Strawberry
would result from any such adventuring, as
well as heavy penalties in hard cash for
Mother. , ,
So here we are with every enclosed
piece of ground we possess, along with
the yard, the front gard°n. the back
lawn: yea, even the verandah —all com-
mandeered bv Cow. And such, a
babel with its bellowings and buntings,
sudden inrushes and retrea ts! Cows, nor-
mally placid Vint now maddened by confine-
ment. make life a nightmare.
“They’re just like us for all the world,”
sighs Mother dispiritedly. “Monotony gets
them down. Shut up the most angehc cow
and she becomes a devil. Baek, Beauty!
Back, I say; do you want the whole of the
hedge?’’
She lays violent hands on a massive beast,
who, with its mouth full of cypress, backs
away only to be embroiled immediately with
two ugly red milkers over first rights to the
pear-tree.
“No, the cows aren’t cows at all just now,”
opines Phyllis, who, being Mother’s daughter,
is a dairymaid by inheritance. “But when
you come to think, it’s quite natural for the
poor beasts ali out of their element, which
is out there.” She waves her red, ealf-chewed
hand toward the open country; then turns
to a maternity case. Here she falls to her
knees, and, a mud-spattered Florence Night-
ingale of the cow-pen, croons over and com-
forts the newly-made mother. “Poor old
Curlytail! Was she sick, then? Wouldn’t its
little ealfie take the milk then? Poor Curly-
tail ! Here, Jimmy and Jack,” she com-
mands her young brothers, "bring me that
beastly calf again. It’s got to drink—Curly-
tail’s getting milk-fever as quick as shb can,
and we’ve our hands full enough with the
supervisor without bringing in the vet.”
The calf is brought staggering and foolish.
Phyllis applies its muzzle to the milk supply
with kind but forceful hands. But for some
reason the infant spurns Nature’s food, and
poor Curlytail’s case looks blacker than ever.
“Take the brat away,” orders Mother im-
patiently. “Put it in the calf-shed, Jimmy,
and give it a bottle of Brindle’s milk. Now,
Curlytail, here’s a nice warm poultice for
you. Lift her leg, Phyllis, while I put it on
—it’ll keep the fever down till the vet. comes.
....There, Curlytail, you’re comfortable.
Leave her, Phyllis; that’s all we can do.”
Mother collapses on to a kerosene-box and
picks chaff and cow-hair from her ears.
" What’s to be the end of it all?” she de-
mands tragically.
“Insolvency, perhaps,” I suggest.
“That’s like you,” rejoins Mother. “Job
might to have been your name, not Julia.”
She muses in sorrow, then falls into recita-
tive. “But this dry-feeding week after week
is sheer ruin. I daren’t count the cost. And
there’s no nourishment in it either —you
simply can’t fill a cow with that stuff.”
She is still pointing a scornful finger at
the mounds of strawy food neatly disposed
for the cows’ morning lunch, when she wheels
suddenly towards the house. “Look out,
there —Beauty’s eating the washing !”
Amid wails of despair, Beauty, chewing a
towel, is chased from the wash-house. She
splashes clumsily through the mud churned
to soup by many hooves, and we all get our
share.
“Six weeks yet before the restrictions are
lifted,” wails Mother, trying, meanwhile, to
draw her feet from the mud’s suction with-
out leaving her shoes behind. Then, desper-
ately, “Would you believe me, there’s times
I wish I never saw a cow”
This seems an awful admission, seeing our
living depends upon milkers, but there’s no
time for further words. The mob is now
mixing things in the milking-yard. Thither,
like a good general, Mother repairs, and
immediately finds herself a vortex round
which a maelstrom revolves. A gate has
been forced open by some young cattle tech-
nicallv known as “them blasted ’eifers,” and
they make for the row of milk-buckets await-
ing'transit to the dairy. Not that the heifers
like milk altogether, but they like excite-
ment. And excitement leads to mob rule
and insurrection, and insurrection sometimes
leads to liberty; so by the time Mother
arrives the whole yardful of animals, old
and young, is a swirling and twisting caul-
don of bovine madness. Mother seeks to
restore reason with a weatherboard: but
though mighty thwacks resound hollowly
on heaving flanks, the flagellator might as
well be using a straw or pelting the revolu-
tionaries with confetti, for the only damage
is loss of cow-hair —and Mother receives that.
But the heifers leave as suddenly as they
came, and there is Mother staring with blaz-
ing eyes at a legacy of flattened buckets
and streams of milk dimpling and eddying
among the flagstones.
Lunch comes, and with it a savage hate
of all cowflesh in the hearts of the dairy-
maids. It is wise to take this meal stand-
ing, otherwise knee muscles become strained
from constant risings to serve “Mee-lk-o’s.”
Nor must a dairymaid look sour at these
constant interruptions. Rather must she
inquire respectfully after the customer’s
decrepit aunt or peevish baby. Not to do
so is “bad form” in a dairymaid, and apt to
lose custom.
Between callers, intrusive cows must be
driven from the dining-room door so that
Jimmy and a bucket of bran mash can pass
safely toward Curlytail; and again luncheon
waits while the dairymaids help to erect
a screen round the invalid, extricate a calf’s
hoof from a rat-trap and save another from
next-door’s bulldog. A merry meal is a
dairymaid’s! 1
Shortly afterwards the red cow is found
with her great face embedded in the bucket
of bran mash. All precautions _ have been
nVtll and void, and the whole dairy staff is
unable to pull that head from the bucket
until Redface has finished the mash.
All day a bellowed oratorio has been
swelling in volume. It has worried Mother,
knowing as she does that it comes from
milkers robbed of their young. Finally, the
plaintive answering of the poddies so in-
censes these matrons that their oratorio be-
comes a war-cry. ,
“I’m frightened—l am, really, says
Mother. "There’s onlv a fence between ’em.
If it holds up, well and good; but it’s only
a temporary thing at best, an’ if the milk-
ers should rush it and it should go wallop” -
she shudders at the picture conjured
up. “There’ll be no milk for the round,
that’s all. An’ me with a dozen ‘one-cow’
babies on mv list. Listen to ’em!”
I do. In'fact, it’s hard to listen to any-
thing else. Our ears are assailed by the
most violent bellowings added to squashy
sounds of hooves stampeding round in the
mud. I frankly admit that things look bad.
Just then a wall-eyed cow that lias been
prowling round Ourlytail’s boudoir in a sus-
picious way, lumbers past. She is chewing
something. After her rushes Mother. “Drop
it, you big brute!” she screams, and vanishes
in hot pursirt. ~ _ .
“What’s she got?” I yell to the flying
flgu re.
“Cnrlvtail’s poultice.” she gasps back.
“That old brute steal anything. . . .eat

tells Mother that rather than remain near
her premises lie’s going to shift.
About this time a mob of heifers in front
ot the house, disturbed in their peaceful
pastime of tearing down grandpa’s passion-
vine, stampedes to the back. Mother is
caving the dairy with a pan of milk when
the horned pests bump round her. Naturally,
the milk is showered over them—Mother not
being superhuman or a professional balancer,
in a surge of anger she strikes out blindly,
and hits the wall, the wire door, her own
knuckles, a boy with a billy and, lastly,
grandpa. - Weeping over his vine, her vener-

Night Prowlers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ll' was one of those quiet nights of late
summer when the moon glinting on the
flew-wet leaves flecks the bush with
silver. The frogs in the swamp kept up a
'leep. continuous chorus, and a spotted owl
from a gum-tree on the hill made reiterated
demands for “more pork.” In the little flat
of green grass by the creek a kangaroo, with
a halt-grown joey in her pouch, was feed-
ing with a number of wallabies. She was
nervous, and every few minutes stood up to
.101 full height of looking like «i silver
statue, nostrils and ears questioning the
wind, and brown eyes gazing into the dark-
nessotthe gully. The joey was impatient
with these interruptions that lifted him out
01. reach of the succulent grass. Once or
twice he attempted to climb out of the
pouch, but he was gently pressed back with
ner tore paws. Suddenly she scented the
danger she had suspected, and bounded away
across the creek; the thump of her tail
being the signal that sent all the other crea-
tures scurrying to cover. The wallabies
dived into their tunnels in the scrub, and
the possum that had ventured down to the
grass scrambled up the trunk of a gum-tree.
lhe thump of the kangaroo’s tail died
away in the distance, and no danger ap-
peared. First a bandicoot ventured out to
continue feeding, and then the wallabies
began to peer from the edge of the scrub,
there was another alarm as a. Tasmanian
tiger, looking like a stockily-built, tawny,
black-spotted dog, trotted along the track
as silent as a shadow. A few seconds spent
in picking up the kangaroo’s scent trom
.hat ot the wallabies and the tiger bounded
across the stream on the trail. It seemed
a forlorn hope, as by this time the kangaroo
must have been a mile and a half away, and
travelling very much quicker than her pur-
suer. A quarter of a mile behind the tiger
came her cub, that seemed to have even less
chance of being in at the end.
The wallabies recovered from their alarm
and came out to feed. A native hen led
her cluckens down the creek-bank, and the
spotted owl flew down to a clump -of tea-
tree. There was only a slight stir as the
kangaroo came bounding down the track
Slf l° *?f J£P)ly anfl again mixed
with the feeders. This time she was too
nervous to do more than pick a few mouth-
* , grass; but she crossed numerous
wallaby tracks in an endeavor to puzzle her
relentless .pursuer, and then jumped the
creek 20 yards lower down. Again the
thump of her' tail died away around the
mug oi the hill. There was another scatter
when the tiger came lumbering down the
hack, ana, with hardly a pause, leapt across
the creek on the kangaroo’s trail; if anv
thing a little further behind than on the
first occasion.
This time the kangaroo’s circle took in
tuo further hills, and it was an hour and a
haJI later when she came down the gully-
She whs not covering in her leaps
within two feet of the ground she had cov-
ered on her first trip. The joey was becom-
ing a heavy burden. Crossing the flat by
the creek she reached to her pouch with her
fore paws and threw him into a clump of
long grass and rushes by the side of the
track. It looked like a deliberate abandon-
ment, but she knew he would lie there quiet
until she came to seek him, and the tiger
would stick fast to her own trail. There
was another long interval of silence except
i°-V,- tlie ~? s , clloril . s and a dusky-fantail
trilling his broken little song to the moon.
The other feeders had deserted the fiat by
the creek for less exciting feeding-ground.
The tiger came round at the same steady
pace: a quarter of a mile closer to the' quarry
thnn when the chase began.
The kangaroo again took a wide circle
and almost blundered into the creek > when
bounding across. Like a tawny shadow the
tiger came before the thump of the kan-
garoo s tail had died away around the hill-
side. Relentlessly she stuck to the trail.
going neither faster nor slower than when
me chase began. Crossing the brow of the
second lull me quarry was in sight. The
kangaroo'made a desperate attempt to out-
pace her pursuer whiie crossing the gum-
tree flat between the hills. Bounding
across tue fallen trunks she cleared 12rt. or
14tt. at a leap, and left the tiger half-a-mile
behind.
Coining down the gully by the creek
only 20 yards separated them, and the kan-
garoo was failing fast. Every stratagem
had been tried : now T she turned to bay. With
her teet in the water of the creek and her
back to the high bank she stood up to her
rull height. The tiger approached warily,
knowing that one rip with the terrible hind
claws would disembowel her. She crossed
the creek and tried to approach to one side,
but the kangaroo was protected by the curve
ot the bank. An attempt from the front
was met with a kick from one of the ready
•l 1 ! rhe kick tvas J' us t too short, but
it left the kangaroo half off her balance,
petore she could recover the tiger was at
her throat, too close to be reached by the
hind teet and almost too close to be hurt
by the fore feet. The momentum of the
spring carried them both down, and the
light was over. The tiger cub arrived in
time to eat the liver from the warm carcase.
Just as daylight broke the remains had been
agged away to their den in the rocks by
tiie gully, to be consumed at leisure.
An hour or two after, a trapper going
around Ins snares was able to read a good
deal ot the tragedy from the signs that were
left His dogs caught the abandoned joey,
and he took it home to his little girl for a pet.

Everlasting Beer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ri 1 HERE are unforgettable moments in
1 the lives of the most humble and
commonplace. One of them came to
me on the day I was introduced to Ebzeb
Oobib. The possessor of this astonishing
name was loaning against the stone sea-wall
near the northern gate of the Sydney Botani-
eal Gardens. He was with my friend Hack-
well Pite, and they were absorbed in an
argument about Bolshevism with which, in
some way, the sectarian issue had become
involved. I remember Pite claimed that
Lenin was an t>x-priest, and Oobib said lie
was an Orangeman.
Oobib was a tall, bent man with hair that
looked as if it had been chewed by mice,
and a long nose, indurated with bvgone
pimples and a sort of dull maroon color at
the tip. He wore spectacles (one glass
broken) and an inadequate straw hat which
someone had apparently tried to burn years
previously. I paid little or no attention to
him till I heard references to his “new
patent beer-extender.” My interest imme-
diately awoke.
“What’s the idea?” I inquired. Seldom
have I hoard such a flow of burning oratory
as this question induced. Boiled down, it
amounted to the fact that he had invented
a method for keeping beer at perpetual high
tide. The only outlay necessary, apart from
cos ] tie exten der, was the original
P the beer —usually about fourpenee.
tovu* ext ® Dc^er *. be explained, is done up in
tabiets Y ou simply drop a tablet in the
f you haye drunk half the beer,
ana the tide immediately rises to the brim
A unique feature is that the beer automati-
cally ceases to rise when it lids reached the
top ot the glass. One tablet will keep the
beer rising to the top for two hours.
W hen I next came across Oobib he was
gumming some stickers on the lower leaves
ot a Moreton Bay fig-tree in Hyde Park.
;~.„ ese , stl ckers were round, and about the
circumference ot a door-knob. Oobib ran
away when he saw me, and I read hi<
sticker in absentia, so to speak. It bore
this announcement: —
OOBIB’S EXTENDER
KEEPS YOUR BEER
AT
PERPETUAL HIGH TIDE.
Sold Privately.
I spent a fortnight fruitlessly trying to
get some information about the extender
ii! 1 t. again came across Oobib. It was in
the Botanical Gardens. He had snared a
water-hen on one of the ponds, and was
gumming a sticker to its back. There was
no one else about, and I sneaked up under
cover ot a tree and got a strangle-grip on
his collar-band.
Tell me more about your extender,” I
urged passionately. “Tell me where I can
get it Sell me a quid’s worth ! Sell me
a cartload—a ton! Where do you live';
a thousand fire the tablets?”
• *? en K°- scampered back
into the water with the advertisement stick
mg to its back.
Come on!” I urged. '‘Let us go and get
a load of these tablets. I understand you
are out for business.”
He showed no inclination to run awav
this t-irne, I released him.
“Hush!” he said, “you have taken me
unawares. The time is not yet ripe. It will
take me another three weeks to cover all
my advertising spaces. 1 have got them
mapped out, but there is not a moment to
los jf' the biggest job is yet to be done,
and that is to get the patent water-proof
stickers on the goldfish in all the ponds.
J-bcn I shall be ready for business.”
„ Bamn the goldfish !” I said impatiently.
1 m thirsty; let’s go and have a drink. ]
w&nt to talk this thing over with vou.”
“Can’t bo done!” he said firmly. “It
would never do for me to be seen in a bar.
The brewers have got me set, and I should
be arrested and they’d put me back again.”
Back again! Where?” I cried, a horrible
suspicion dawning on me slowly but surely.
Why! Don’t you know? Aren’t you the
warder who said I was harmless? * Don’t
you remember taking me to the gate after
the doctor let me out on trial for three
months? Of course, you remember. Didn’t
I tell you at the gate that I’d change mv
name because it was the same as yours?” '
I left him sorting out his waterproof
stickers.
“I’ve worked this beer-extender out on
the principle of the rising tides,” lie called
after me as I walked away. “I’ll have some
of the tablets ready in about three weeks.”

the reliability, strength, endurance and speed of the “Wolseley” Cars have
been made still more famous than ever by reason of the wonderful perform-
ances recently put up by the smallest “Wolseley” model—the “Wolseley” Ten.
NEW WORLD’S RECORDS
by The WOLSELEY TEN
but six months after the 15 new world’s
records set up by the same car at Brook-
lands in October and November last is
surely the most positive proof of
“Wolseley” perfection.
The outstanding feature of these wonder-
ful Wolseley performances is that they
were accomplished by a standard chassis
with but slight modifications to suit racing
conditions, all the main essentials,
constituting 90 per cent, of the chassis,
remaining unaltered.
To any prospective car purchaser such
performance should surely prove convinc-
ingly that the car for consideration—first
and last— is the “Wolselev.”
The Wolseley’Ten- Fifteen
are Ready for Immediate Delivery,
each model combining those qualities that stand for all-round everyday performance in
equal ratio to the brilliant track performances of the “Ten.”
Responsiveness of engine at all times, speed, reliability, perfect springing, economy of
“?Y/ e ? P \ P^ US re^ beauty of finish and luxurious appointments, certainly place the
W olseley ’ as foremost of all cars for useful and satisfactory service.
To be a “Wolseley” owner is something to be proud of.
