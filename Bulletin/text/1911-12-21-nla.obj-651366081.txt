Maeterlinck.
Maeterlinck
Maurice Maeterlinck, experimental bot-
anist, experienced apiarist, practical motor-
ist, mystic moralist, popular playwright,
critic of letters, genial essayist, pleasant
philosopher, husband of a celebrated actress,
and owner of an ancient Benedictine abbey
where his wife had played “Macbeth,” is
now nearly 50. It is apparent that he has
grown up—though tliaj fact is made even more
obVious by a comparison of his early and
his later work. Maeterlinck’s whole his-
tory may be compressed into three Avords:
He grew up. Most poets don’t.
Maurice Maeterlinck, by Edward Thomas,
(Methuen), is merely an account of the
poet’s growing up. Maeterlinck came of a
Flemish family, and lived his early years in
country that was very like the background
of his early mystic plays.
Maeterlinck used often to watch the quiet
and monotonous life of the Flemish peasants
near his home.... He often peeped into one
cottage where lived seven brothers and a
sister, “all old, toothless, worn,” who worked
together, and in the evening sat together
silent or talking with repetitions like those
of Les Aveugles.
He read for the Bar, but at 24 discov-
ered literature and Paris, published a book
of poems, and said farewell to the law. He
returned to his home at Oostaeker for some
years; and from here he gave to the world
hiS first play, La Frincesse Malaine, hailed
as a work of genius by French critics. In
1896; he settled in Paris ; and now, at nearly
50, he rests assured in a popularity unique
in that it has been won by not one, but
three Maeterlincks. For some he is the
mystic dramatist, for others the genial prose
philosopher, and for a third section he is
famous as the expert deviser of spectacular
and theatric plays of the type of Monna
Vanna and The Blue Bird. The latter en-
tertainment will be seen on the Australasian
stage next year.
With the year 1896 ends the work of
Maeterlinck’s youth. That period contains
eig-ht plays of the type of Pelleas et Melis-
ande, and two volumes of verse. These early
plays are Maeterlinck’s most characteristic
contribution to literature; and if posterity
remembers him it will surely be because of
these plays. Despite their faults, they herald
a new dramatic influence; and if Maeter-
linck lias forgotten them the world will not.
He aimed in those early dramas at making
for his ideals a dramatic scheme peculiarly
his own; and he succeeded by the apparently
childish simplicity of his means in making
many of his scenes extraordinarily effective.
These plays are all variations of the one
theme, “the littleness, the impotence, the
lostness of mankind.” The sound of them
is “sweet, because the creatures are so small
and far away, and unlike anything known
to us.” The frail characters are hidden in
vast palaces, lost at the end of interminable
corridors, in dark forests where no sun ever
shines, in vaults melancholy with the sound
of the sea. Maeterlinck has suggested in a
description in Interieur the aim of his early
drama. The people in this play are seen
from outside, through lit windows, inside a
house, unconscious that tragedy is waiting
to break in on their peace.
When one of them rises, walks, or makes
a gesture, the movements appear grave, slow,
apart, and as though spiritualised by the
distance, the light, and the transparent film
of the’window panes.
The old man says definitely that he seems
to see them “from the altitude of another
world.” The whole piece is evidently elab-
orated from an impression of a lighted in-
terior seen thus detached, and its effect is to
sum up and intensify the feeling of the fas-
cinated spectator. In spite of the crowd
outside, the movement, and the t-alk, it re-
mains purely dream-like and lacking in the
breath of life.
, But Maeterlinck was already beginning to
sit up and take notice. The plays and early
essays had something of a mute, resigned,
religious gloom. This gave way before a
freer acceptance of modern life. He came
out of the vagueness of the gloomy past into
the nineteenth century. As a critic said, at
this period “he met Life and Nietzsche.”
And we may pardonably add that he met
Georgette Lablanc, the actress who became
his wife and played “Lady Macbeth” in the
domestic abbey, with the audience trooping
hurriedly from room to room to witness each
succeeding act.
Monna Vanna was the first definite break-
away from his old formulae. It is the first
play to be set in a dated period. But signs
had been apparent of Maeterlinck’s revolt
even earlier.
Of Ardiane et Barbe Bleue, Thomas re-
gretfully remarks:—
The atmosphere is purely that of the
theatre. The magic is stage magic; the
mystery is contrived. The vaults and the
hall with the many doors really seem to
emphasise the difference this play
anu the early ones. In them there was a
natural mystery of darkness, space and ob-
scurity, the mystery of a yet dim and half-
understood dawn world. In Ardiane et
Barbe Bleue all is theatrical: it begins and
ends in a theatre, and has no existence save
as a number of picturesque and uncertainly
symbolic scertes. It provides opportunities
for impressive and subtle staging, and its
words are worthy....lt is more material
and plainly sensuous than any of the works
which preceded it. It says all that it means
and suggests nothing.
And Maeterlinck himself said that moral
or philosophic intentions were not to be
looked for in such plays.
In his later dramas, Maeterlinck has be-
come a popular dramatist with a strong
sense of the pictorial, and a master of
theatrical effect. His later plays “play.”
He even wrote a new fourth act to The Blue
Bird, for Mr. Herbert Trench, “in which,”
says Edward Thomas, “he very nearly left
the Blue Bird out altogether.” As for the
elaborate symbolism for which the. critics,
misled by his earlier symbolist drama, have
looked and which they have, therefore,
naturally found in this fairy extravaganza,
Thomas is frankly disdainful. He says that
the Blue Bird means happiness, and that is
all that there is in it, and all that the new
Maeterlinck put into it. Thomas adds to
his summing up of his dramatic work: “He
has only failed to create a human charac-
ter.”
£
A parallel evolution is discerned in Mae-
terlinck -the philosopher and essayist. Lc‘
Tresor des Humbles, of which tolerance and
the sense of mystery are the foundations, is
the early Maeterlinck. “The book points to
mysteries under the surface of life which are
as impressive as the corridors, vaults and
dark waters which are their symbols in the
plays.” But La Sagesse et la Destinge, pub-
lished but two years later, show his reaction
to the influence of “Life and Nietzsche.” And
through his other works, such as The Life of
the Bee, and Le Double Jardin, we see the
strong ferment of modernity working.
Of The Life of the Bee, the critic says
that it is aimed deliberately and consciously
at the public. It is not a masterpiece that
has grown up naively in darkness and soli-
tude—which, of course, explains why it was
so immediately popular. It does not “smell
of the bee” : it smells of belles lettres.
But Maeterlinck had been also perfecting
bis craft. Of Le Double Jardin, Thomas
pronounces
These essays prove him by far the most
brilliant of essayists in this generation,
never tedious or banal, always adroit, ingen-
ious, cheerful, impressive and picturesque.
And he delightfully adds: —
I should like to see him writing upon ban-
tams for The Feathered World / it would be
the most beautiful chapter ever written on
bantams.
Also, the present writer looks to him to give
the finest literary impression of aviation.
But Materlinck is not impeccable; his
symbolism occasionally runs away with him.
When it suits him, he will write as if he
had never scorned the false old mysteries
with which poets yet chill our blood ; will
speak, for instance, of Edward the Seventh,
lying ill of appendicitis, as an “illustrious”
victim of “a whim” of fate “hovering between
the crpwn and death. ” The whole essay is
a tissue of gaudy and almost tawdry elo-
quence : the king, who has not been crowned,
though he was king in every sense, is des-
cribed as about to attain “the sole object,
the essential moment” of his life; and it is
surmised that this “royal tragedy” proves
the impotence of man’s love, prayers and
“finest moral forces” against the will of
Nature.
Finally:—
fie is the advocate, and the preacher. He
does not originate, but expands with subtle
eloquence what he has learnt... .He ad-
dresses, not philosophers or scholars, but the
humble, the magazine readers, the general
public, and he is neither technical nor ob-
scure.... He has his clear and sweet style,
his sentimentally colored words, his infec-
tious rhythms. Maeterlinck is the first “mys-
tic,” though not the first mystical writer, to
appear in the age of science; and he is all
the more important because he really belongs
to his age. He is not, however, always a
mystic and a man of science at once, and
there are times when he seems to be striving
to look at scientific facts in a poetical man-
ner. Thus some of his passages are simply
science in fancy dress.
Edward Thomas’s work is a comprehen-
sive text-book to the man. The author’s
critical explanation of the plays and prose
works is carefully and occasionally illumin-
atively done, and especially in the analysis
of the sources of Maeterlinck’s inspiration
the book is worth while.
Conrad and Henry dames
The flood of English autumn fiction is
upon us, and the gutters are running with
novels. The literary drought has broken.
Twenty-nine inches of novels fell on London
last week —and what is an alleged literary
critic going to do with 29 novels per week?
He can’t read them. All that a drown-
ing man can do is to clutch at the nearest
handful of straws, and, if among this hand-
ful, he notices the names of Joseph Conrad
and Henry James —one wonders if Henry
James was ever, even in youth, called Harry,
or even Jim?—-he cannot cast them away.*
Joseph Conrad has outlived his outcasts of
the islands —that dim underworld of half-
caste, savage and derelict white; but in his
new novel he finds a new and a just as psy-
chologically interesting underworld to ex-
plore. He has discovered Russia. And he
has not only written a grim, impressive,
murky story of the Russian; he has penned
a novel that might have been written by a
great Russian writer.
For the purposes of his novel, Conrad
assumes the personality of an old English
teacher of languages at Geneva. But he is
not a Westerner: he is Conrad; and the
turbid soul of bis Russian hero and the ex-
traordinarily limpid soul of the Russian girl
are just the kind of dissecting cases that
Conrad needs for his deft psychological lan-
cet. Here is how he handles his lancet upon
the Russian soul: —
What must remain extraordinarily strik-
ing to a teacher of languages is the Russians’
extraordinary love of words. They gather
them up; they cherish them, but they don’t
hoard them in their breasts; on the contrary,
they are always ready to pour them out by
the hour or by the night with an enthusiasm,
a sweeping abundance, with such an aptness
of application sometimes, that, as in the
case of very accomplished parrots, one can’t
defend oneself from the suspicion that they
really understand what they say. There is
a generosity in their ardor of speech, which
removes it as far as possible from common
loquacity; and it is ever too disconnected to
be classed as eloquence.
The mark, in Conrad’s western eyes, of
the Russian autocracy and of Russian revolt
is cynicism.
In its pride of numbers, in its strange pre-
tensions of sanctity, and in the secret readi-
ness to abase itself in suffering, the spirit of
Russia is the spirit of cynicism. It informs
the declarations of her statesman, the
theories of her revolutionists, and the mystic
vaticinations of prophets to the point of
making freedom look like a form of debauch,
and the Christian virtues themselves appear
actually indecent....
I suppose one must be a Russian to under-
stand Russian simplicity, a terribly corrod-
ing simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe
ft naive and hopeless cynicism. I think some-
times that the psychological secret of the
profound difference of that people consists
in this, that they detest life, the irre-
mediable life of the earth as it is, whereas
we westerners cherish it with perhaps an
equal exaggeration of its sentimental value.
The story is of a Russian student who is
so compromised by having, unasked, to shel-
ter a revolutionist who has just killed an
official with a bomb that, after having made
one futile effort to get the fugitive away, he
revolts and gives the stranger up to the
police. The revolutionist is promptly exe-
cuted, but the police are not quite satisfied
that his betrayer had told all that he knew.
The result is that his rooms are searched,
and he is given to understand that his whole
future will be under the eyes of the police—
which means that he will have no career.
Meantime, lie is hailed by the revolution-
ists as one of themselves, a hero for the
cause; and, in disgust, he becomes a tool of
the autocracy. He is sent on a spying mis-
sion to Geneva, the home of the revolution-
ists. Preceded by his reputation, the spy
is received as a friend and fellow worker;
but here he has to meet the mother and the
sister of the man he had betrayed. He suf-
fers torments in liis ceaseless efforts to
guard against betraying himself. The catas-
trophe comes only when he knows that he
is safe from discovery- His desire to escape
from the mesh of necessary lies he has had
to weave about himself becomes so overpow-
ering with the recognition of the love and trust
of the sister of the dead man that he con-
fesses to her and to the revolutionists. He
is swiftly, horribly, almost incredibly pun-
ished.
This fine story is instinct with the sense
of fatality; the situations are remorselessly
logical; the psychology is almost brutal; but
his method is still the method of Lord Jim —
a series of digressions and roundabout pro-
gressions. And he has added to his gallery of
curious portraits that strange colony of
Russian revolutionists in refuge at Geneva.
All of these people seem as if they could
only have been done from life. As a novel it
will not be much liked ; it is for us too
Russian —and, of course, Conrad is not a
writer beloved of women; but as a text-book
of the meaning of the Russian chaos it is
invaluable.
J*
And now for Henry James. But The Out-
cry cannot be adequately reviewed except in
the Henryjamesian language. It is, like the
American accent, a quite too dreadfully easy
thing to, let us “competently explain,” pick
up. The trail of Henryjamesism is over the
great, dazzling “spread” of modern English
literature; its influence, its delicate tinge,
“quite positively” “glares” up from the
novelists’ pages. Henry James, with his
delicate commas, his perpetual, diffident
search for the exact, the only, word, the
beautifully italicised preposition, and his in-
volved yet persevering, interminable sen-
tence, has, well, with high candor we must
” * Under' Western Eyes, by Jose}* Conrad (Me-
thuen per Dyrhock’s Library). Ihe Outcry, by
Henry Janies (Methuen, per Dymoek s Library)-
say it, feminised the English language so
delicately that to the, if we dare use so jour-
nalistic a phrase, “average reader,” it is—
let’s see, where exactly icere we? —it is al-
most as beautifully hard to understand as a
feminine soul. There!
This page, it will be apparent, has tem-
porarily succumbed to the Henryjamesian
epidemic; and it is necessary to use
Henryjamesisms. Luckily the author pro-
vides plenty of words, commas and beauti-
ful phrases in his novel. His style is
“formed and fondled and finished” ; he “beau-
tifully shows what he beautifully sees,” aDd
“clearly, you might put it as you liked —it
all comes back to your being more charmed”
—that is, of course, if you like Henry James.
Its “so apparent perfection” “shows for
beautiful” if, for instance, you “get” the
sense of so delightful a sentence as this:—
Lord Theign, after the longest but the
blankest contemplation of him, broke here-
upon, for the first time, that attitude of com-
pletely sustained and separate silence which
he had yet made compatible with his air of
having deeply noted every element of the
scene —so that it was of this full view his
participation had effectively consisted.
Of course, you can make of this “a jolly
lot” or you can “treat it as rather a ‘lark.’ ”
As one character “perversely sighs,” “Ah, we
can at least go on talking!” They do.
“Oh, I often, with the wild beauty, if you
will,, of so many of his turns, haven’t a
notion,” Lady Sandgate confessed with an
equal gaiety, “of what he ! s talking about.”
“I think I never miss his weird sense,” her
younger guest again loyally contended—
“and, in fact, as a general thing I rather
like it!”
You, as a matter of fact, if you are a con-
firmed Henryjamesiac, generally do.
But we must pull up, or, like one of the
characters, the readers’ face will fall “almost
with a crash,” if ever we are going to di-
vulge the plot. The Outcry is the noise made
about the intended sale of one of the greatest
of Lord Theign’s art treasures to a fabu-
lously rich American; and woven about the
negotiations is—that astonishing thing in
Henry James —a plot. The finish is quite
exciting. And the art of the construction —-
each of the three parts of the novel is con-
trived as a separate scene, exactly like a
drama with plenty of the dramatist's stage
directions —shows the author in all his al-
most —again falling back on Henry James —-
“damnable” cleverness.
The life of Barrington, who left his
country for his country’s good—and ulti-
mately for ours —furnishes Roy Bridges
(author of, By Mis Excellency’s Command)
with stirring adventure for his romantic
novel, Mr. Barrington (Bookstall Co., Is.).
Bridges has written a fine adventure yarn of
the highway—and the highwayman is the
proud father of the bushranger.
The Australian Catalogue, a reference in-
dex to the books and periodicals published
and still current in the Commonwealth, com-
piled by A. B. Foxcroft, of Melb. Public
Library (Whitcombe and Tombs), has-been
wanted for a long time by everybody inter-
ested in Australian literature. The index
is well done: the critic has been able so far
to find only one notable omission, and that
of a book published in Melbourne.
Australia To-day (Is. 6d.), the seventh

statistical summary of the present prosperity

“Harrison O.”: The Tasmanian Evening News
has given up the ghost, at Hobart, after an undis-
tinguished existence that commenced 28 years ago.
The Flyspeck press is not, and never has been, calcu-
lated to arouse enthusiasm. The Mercury was first
issued in 1854, as the Hobart Town Mercury (price
4d.) ; George Auber Jones and John Davies were
the proprietors, but Jones vanished after two
months, and the rag, which, up till then, had been
issued twice a week, blossomed into a tri-weekly. It
was not until 1858 that it became a daily, having
previously absorbed the Colonial Times and the
Tasmanian. Since then, the Mercury has swallowed
the Tasmanian Daily News, Daily Courier, Ad-
vertiser and Tasmanian Times. The first Ply-
speck news rag was produced by Collins, the Secre-
tary of the province, on January 8, 1819. It called
itself the Derwent Star and Van Diemen's Land
Intelligencer, and was a sheet of foolscap printed
on both sides, and issued fortnightly. Thirsty souls
who desired to drink its news had to segregate
themselves from two bob, unless they could cadge a
copy The editorial throne was occupied by Deputy
Surveyor-General G. P. Harris. The sheet ceased
to exist at the end of its first year. 1 Other ancient
Plyspeck papers were the Van Diemen's Land
Gazette and General Advertiser, founded May
21 1813 ; Andrew Bent’s I-Iobart Town Gazette,
June 1, 1816; Gazette and Van Diemen's Land
Advertiser (born 1824, died the next year) ; the
Tasmanian, the first rag published in Launceston,
issued on January 5, 1825; the Colonial Times
(also 1825) ; the Tasmanian and Austral Asiatic
Review (March, 1827), and the Hobart Town
Courier (October of the same year). The Corn-
wall Press and the Launceston Advertiser eventu-
ated in 1829.
That highly respectable, but heavy-as-dough pro-
duction, the Otago (M.L.) Daily Times, celebrated
its 50th anniversary last month, to the accompani-
ment of the fervently-expressed satisfaction df George
V. and thousands of others of its constant readers.
The O.D.T. made its first appearance on November
15, 1861, at a time when “the diggings” were pan- j
ning out about 35,000oz. of gold fortnightly, and
attracting tens of thousands of fortune-seekers. An
idea of the cost of living in “the roaring ’60’s” is
obtainable from a glance at the sominercial column
of the new paper. Flour is quoted at £20 a ton;
bread, Is. the 41b. loaf; butter, 2s. 4d. a lb. ; salt,
Is. 8d. to Is. lOd. a lb.; milk, 8d. a quart; meat,
lOd. to Is. a lb. St : ll, there were some who could
afford the money at a pinch. One party of miners at
Wellington Gully (near Gabriel’s Gully) are specially
mentioned by the Tuapeka correspondent of the
paper as regularly clearing £100 per man per week.
In the first leading article appears the policy of the
paper. “From this day we aspire to be the histori-
cal mirror of all that occurs in Otago... With poli-
tics we desire to meddle as little as-possible. . . It
is hardly necessary to say that our columns will not
be open to sectarian controversies, but it will always
be our aim to encourage everything calculated to
promote the sacred interests of religion.” Finally:
“Let the public foster the first days of the young
bantling, not only with copious supplies of adver-
tisements, but with assistance in enlarging the cir-
culation, and we promise, on our part, that the infant
shall advance to rapid development, and become a
journal calculated to reflect credit on those who
aided its earliest days.”
“Bails”; The late Harry Hedley—“Mid-On” of
the Age and Leader —had a brother George, who was
in a Victorian Eleven ; and Harry hirnself was a fine
hitter. Jack Conway brought him forward as a
writer. Jack, Bob Whitworth and Garnet Walch
had a Melbourne threepenny weekly, named Town
Talk. It didn’t last long, but long enough to show
Hedley’s calibre as a cricket writer. Conway and
Whitworth both had to do with the Age and
Leader, and thus Harry Hedley was “introduced.”
From playing the imall part of usher, he worked up
to the Bench of Cricket Judges, formed of “Ob-
server” Don Macdonald, Hedley, “Felix” Horan, and
“Almanac” Dave Scott. Hedley was like the actor
who is most in favor with the actors; he had no
fringe as a writer, but was prime favorite with the
Men who Knew. Macdonald has his unapproachable
qualities for the general public. Horan is the un-
equalled man for tit-bits of personal reminiscence.
Thus, between one and another, Melbourne has been
more variously served with cricketarians than any
other place I know of.

Of sin, and sought the Gates of Gold,
And finding tnere I was not one of them they count

Always in hope to find a scope for talent earth

Would spurt in flame my hapless name —and then the

Speaks of the Broken Hill mines,
and how he lost his health
through lead and gas poisoning.
Clements Tonic, Ltd., has published strik-

of Clements Tonic in restoring health when
recovery is despaired of. These letters are
striking examples of the value of good health
in contrast to ill-health. This is mentioned

future. Miners and painters especially should
read this letter, written from Scott and Clyde
Streets, Kensington, South Australia, Sep-
tember T, 1911.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“Of all the mines in Australia I think the Broken Hill mines are
the most injurious for the health of a miner, and it was whilst working
there, and suffering from an attack of lead and gas poisoning, that I first
discovered the merits of your splendid lonic. IT ACTED LIKE
MAGIC IN MY CASE. When I was convalescent I used to feel too
weary and languid for anything; everything seemed a trouble to me, but
after taking a couple of bottles of your famous ■ medicine I fell like a new
man. lam well known in Broken Hill, having worked on the Central
mines for 10 years. GRATITUDE AND THE WELFARE OF MY
FELLOW-WORKMEN prompt me to pen this note, and you are at
liberty to make what use you like of it. I recommend your Tonic every-
where. (Signed) EDWARD ELLIS.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The Woman Behind the Woman.
Ellen, the woman, is fair,
As a casual glance may discover.
I know not —but some declare
That John, the man, is her lover.
Though gossip be idle stuff,
Met mostly where sense is lacking,
He takes her about enough
To give the town’s talk backing.
At times, of an afternoon,
They sit in the park together;
Ellen, a rose a-swoon
In gold, midsummer weather.
Her hair in the sunshine gleams,
Coiled smooth in a dainty fashion ;
Yes, roselike, a rose she seems,
All color and perfume and passion.
Sure, love is abroad in the air—-
About them, and over, and under ;
Yet the man sits silent there,
And the chill in his eyes makes wonder.
There’s ice in his veins, it may be,
Or, perhaps, he is less than hitman,
Or more —with a power to see
The woman behind the woman!

When a Fellow Does His Damnedest.
I heard a Voice all-potent, singing deep within my
soul —
“Be a Strong Man, be a Smiter —keep thy Manhood
sure and whole!”
I have gathered up the splendor of the earth and
sea and sky,
And to thee I give the glory when the proud storm-
pennons fly !
Be thou worthy of the kingdom—-thou who sittest
on this throne,
Be a Fighter strong and valiant, not a weakling
slack and prone!
Be a Captain, be a Leader —10, when Wisdom’s door
unbars,
Thou shaft climb with Me triumphant up the stair-
case of the stars!”
I heard Jehovah singing in a proud, exultant kef'* —
“When a Fellow Does His Damnedest, it is homage
unto Me !
For I am a God of Battle, not a Lord of humble
tears;
Dear to Me the scabbard’s rattle and the thrust of
stubborn spears !
Who are these that vainly murmur, with a sad and
strengthless moan ?
Who are these that weep and falter, while the Strong
Man Goes Alone?
For My heart is towards the Smiters, towards the
Leaders in the van —-
Be a King, Oh! be a Master, be a Soldier and a
Man ! ”
I heard the Voice puissant rolling like a trumpet-
call—
“Beat the steel and bend the iron—be a Captain
over all!
Be a Builder, be a Maker —where the savage lolls at
ease,
Hidden strength beneath the breaker lifts the isle
’midst tropic seas !
’Tis the Insect Climbing Upward from the bed of
ocean slime —
Climbing Lightward, climbing starward, through the
years of Silent Time !
When a Creature Does Its Damnedest anthems peal
beyond the stars,
For the strength that Lifts and Labors breaks the
spirit's prison-bars!”
I heard the God-Head singing, and the Message
from the Throne
Stirred my soul with strength puissant when the
Seed of Faith was sown !
“Be a Soldier of the Legion, be a Captain if you
can”—-
Rang the anthem trumpet-pealing: “Be a Smiter, be
a Man!
Be a Climber, groping upwards from the gulfs and
from the slime —
Do Thy Damnedest, do it ever and thy soul shall
conquer Time!
For the atoll is an altar raised from far depths of
the sea—
I am God, I love the Fighters and the Strong Souls
Serving Me!”
Who hears the Voice Triumphant, ringing bell-like
in his soul?—
Chanting proudly, “Be a Lifter, be a Strong Man
sure and whole!”
He has gathered up the splendor of the sky and
earth and sea,
Who has heard Jehovah singing as the God-Head
sings to me!
He is worthy of the glory, of the Kingdom and the
Throne,
Who is strong, and battle-visaged—not a weakling
slack and prone !
He is Captain, he is Leader —do your Damnedest ere
you go;
God ivho hails the Fighting Insect Hails the Strong
Man’s Hammer-Blow !
VICTORIA.
GRANT HERVEY.
A Thunder Cloud.
The night is black, one heavy bank of cloud
Obscures the herald glimmer of the moon
That soon should rise. The faint sea breathes aloud'
And the wide air above the Sands a-swoon,
Chill, as with fear, and held in moveless wonder,
Waits under the curved dark for flame and thunder.
Pitch blackness moves against the starless night,
Vast formless shapes roll shoreward fold on fold,
As though the void, in triumph over light,
Drew all her legions from the outer cold,
Like some despair of over-reaching sorrow,
That having drowned to-day would whelm to-morrow.
And 10, with sudden flame the world a-fire,
Gleams for a heart-beat, calling darker night,
Ravless as God’s despair, or Death’s desire,
After that brightness, till from out the height,
Each rolling echo calling to its fellow,
The thunders as of judgment range and bellow.
Then, as if lifted by an unseen hand,
The shapeless horror brightens at the rim,
And by the wide sea’s limit, where the land
Reaches a long arm, glimmers, faint and dim,
Shrouded in cloud, but ever slowly growing,
The sweet, pale brightness from God’s white moon
flowing.

PRESERVE YOUR BEAUTY.-*
The Australian Climate is noted for its deleterious effects upon the complexion;
freckles, “muddiness,” pimples and other blemishes are likely to make their ap-
pearance unless something is done as a deterrent. There is nothing like
ICILMA Fluor Cream,
the “/ace cream without grease ,” for keeping the skin healthy and beautiful. It
is the product of natural mineral waters in Algeria, and is therefore rightly
named “NATURE’S REMEDY.” A little rubbed on 'the face BEFORE going
out assists nature to preserve that wonderful velvety condition that is every
woman’s aim and pride. All Chemists, 2/* per pot. Sample tube, 3d. in stamps.

CONCERNING COMPANIES AND PRI-
VATE CAPITALISTS.
The McGowen Ministry got its Income-
tax measure through the N.S.W. Assembly
without offering any elaborate explanation
of its attitude towards joint stock enter-
prise. Possibly it had no explanation to
offer. Treasurer Dacey stated blandly that it
was the policy of the Government to look on
a man in a more hostile spirit if he invested
his money in a company (perhaps a hard-
working Australian company that made
bricks or butter), than if he buried it in
property (slum or otherwise); and that a
; small income derived from a company which
made (possibly) boots or clothes or hats
would be much more severely penalised than
a large one earned by personal dealing in
bad grog, or by beguiling the public to bet
, on the wrong horse, or by putting a head on
one’s fellow man in a roped square. He ex-
plained that these things would be so, but
he didn’t say why they would be so. He
announced that a company would not
be allowed the £3OO exemption granted to
private individuals, even to absentees; that
the small, poor company would be hit as
heavily as the large rich one; that the com-
pany which followed the needful and honor-
able job of making clothes or roofing tiles
v would be bumped just as hard as the one
which lived by usury or beer; and that the
Australian company wouldn’t get the ad-
vantage, as compared with the foreign one,
that the Australian individual is to enjoy.
He revealed that even a small company
of seven or eight working partners, making
a miserable profit of perhaps £3OO a year
over and above wages, was going to be smit-
ten at the rate of rather over twice as much
in the £ as the person who drew £3OOO a
year from a partnership, all for his own
spending. He expounded all these things,
but the reason of them he did not expound.
It was a remarkable situation, and nothing
has happened to make it any less remark-
able. In fact, when the w r ay of the Bill was
smoothed into the Upper House by a
sort of promise that it would be repealed
next year and a very different kind of
measure brought in, the situation became
wonderful.
* L * * *
As regards the private individual the
McGowen Ministry proposed a sliding scale
of taxation, with an addition of one-third
where the income is derived from property,
and of one-third more where the owner is
an absentee. So the scheme was calculated
to produce results like these :
Income Tax on Various Kinds op Income.
Profits of
company

Salary be divided
or Jn- among
come* om Rents Rents 100 or

come. Lent. landlord). landlord). holders).

7000 238 6 8 317 15 7 397 4 6 408 6 8
The case for the private capitalist is really
better than shown above, for he receives an
allowance or additional exemption in re-
spect of each child aged less than 16 and
having no separate means of support, while
the company gets no rebate even though
its shareholders have 24,000 children to sup-
port. It is a curious business all round.
The whole policy of levying special in-
come tax on companies, simply because they
are Companies, is rotten. It might even be
said to be deranged. The tax should be
levied, not on the corporation but on its
members. They should pay individually on
their individual shares of the profits, so that
the person who drew £lO,OOO or £20,000 a
year in dividends from a number of con-
cerns would pay as a rich man at the rich
man’s rate, and the person who drew £5O
or £2O from one poor little woollen co. or
creamery corporation would be exempt un-
less he or she had other sources of revenue
which raised the income to the tax level.
Then the absentee shareholder should be
taxed extra for being an absentee, and the
local shareholder should receive special con-
sideration for being a. good Australian and
spending his money in the country. This
would be an improvement on the McGowen
idea that an absentee shareholder is as good
as a local one, and that a local shareholder
is very much worse than an absentee land-
lord. The trouble seems to arise out of a
mistaken idea that a company is an animal
or an individual. As a matter of fact, it is
a number, sometimes a great number, of
individuals, and some of them may be com-
paratively poor. The A.M.P. Society with
some £26,000,000 or £27,000,000 worth of
assets, looks, for instance, an exceedingly
bloated corporation and a fit mark for
special taxation ; but jt really represents the
savings of some 230,000 people, and these
own on the average about £3.20 apiece of the
funds. That amount isn’t enough to buy a
three-roomed wooden cottage in Paddington.
Even the Bank of N.5.4V., with its
£5,600,000 of shareholders’ funds, isn’t quite
what it seems, for it is the property of over
3300 people who own, on the average, about
£l5OO worth of bank per man or woman,
and receive on the average about £9O each
out of the profits.
The situation may be summed up thus:
The absentee company, the company that
rack-rents or practises usury, the company
that pays low wages and works its em-
ployees long hours under unhealthy condi-
tions, and tlie company that runs a mono-
poly are almost as objectionable as the pri-
vate individual who does one or all of these
things, and the law should fall upon it with
both hands and all its feet. But it is not
more objectionable than the private absen-
tee, or usurer, or sweater, or rack-renter, or
monopolist. In fact, it has this saving
grace—-that it has to issue balance-sheets,
and thus the country can keep some track
of its doings and know exactly how bad it
is, while no one really knows how much the
individual robber is taking from the com-
munity. The opinion seemingly held by the
McGowen Government, that the principle
of co-operation is of necessity a curse and a
thing to be discouraged by special taxation,
rests on no solid basis. And its idea that it
is better for a big industry to be owned by
one bloated capitalist than by, perhaps, 200
people, many of them comparatively poor —
so much better that it is necessary to handi-
cap the co-operative affair in order to give
the one bloated private individual a special
chance to run it out of existence —looks like
an absolute negation of Democratic prin-
ciples. Shareholders are of various classes.
Some are rich money-makers with a bril-
liant capacity for snatching the right finan-
cial moment and grabbing at the skirts of
the unearned increment. Some are in the
shareholding business because they lack the
knowledge or energy to run businesses of
their own. This is the class to which the
widow and the elderly spinster mostly be-
long, ancient, unpractical, spectacled folk
who don’t know how to run a timber yard
or a line of steamers or a boiling-downs.
Others are shareholders because of their
comparative poverty. Not having the
money to buy a house or a number of houses
on their own single account, like Premier
McGowen, they invest their laboriously-
saved £5O or £3OO or £2OO in a little lot of
shares and hope for the best. Lacking the
means to start a universal providery on the
Anthony Hordern plan they buy a scrap
of the tail-end of one in the shape of a little
bit of scrip. These different people might
reasonably be taxed according to their
wealth, but it is a crude proceeding to lump
them all in one condemnation of Is. 2d. in
the £ simply because they have co-operated.
# * * *
A very large proportion of companies in
Australia are manufacturing concerns, and
are doing something in the way of shoving
Australian industries along. On the other
hand, the much less beneficent job of own-
ing property and collecting- rents from ten-
ants is to a great extent in private hands.
Certain industries, such as the making of
butter and cheese for export, and deep gold
mining, almost owe their existence to the
co-operative idea. Companies, like share-
holders, are of all sorts —rich and poor,
large and small. Some find it a long time be-
tween drinks; in fact, some haven’t sighted
a dividend for 20 years. They have all vari-
eties of principle or lack of principle. But
at the worst, they represent a valuable idea.
They give small folk a chance of investment
and an opportunity to be part-owners of
the country's industries. In some measure,
they represent a revolt against the domina-
tion of the individual capitalist. The mono-
polist corporation is an evil, just like the
overgrown millionaire, or the landlord who
wants the earth, which is a reason why
special legislation should fall on it. But
the idea of discouraging co-operative indus-
try in general for the advantage of the indi-
vidual capitalist is midsummer madness. The
individual capitalist hasn’t been such a
gigantic success as to call for all this con-
sideration.
THE POSITION IN MAORILAND.
The Maoriland elections are over, and great
is the wailing and hard language thereof.
For the mighty Liberal-Labor combination,
which has danced to its own piping since
1891, when the calamitous Atkinson Gov-
ernment was finally heaved into the political
rubbish-tip, has been caught up by the
remnants of that party, and struck down in
its tracks. And when lousepii Ward arose
and, turning round with a sudden jerk,
blew the dust out of the deaf ear he
turns to the howls of the mortgage, which
break out in the still hours of calm reflec-
tion, 10, his glory had departed, and his big
majority in the House of Representatives
had been turned into a minority. The posi-
tion in the last Parliament was that the
Opposition, led by Massey, could muster 25
strong in a House' of 80 members. On De-
cember 7, however, the first ballot for the
new House altered things thuswise: Gov-
ernment, 22; Opposition, 25. Seven days
later, the second ballots (30) completed the
disaster by dividing the parties as follows ;
Government, 35 ; Opposition, 37 ; Labor and
Labor-Socialists, 4; Independent, 1. If
Joseph could rely upon the support of the
Labor representatives, as he doubtless can
upon the three Maori representatives, to be
■elected in a day or two, he could be reason-
ably sure that the quarter-deck would be his
end of the ship for another three years, any-
how. But, unfortunately for Joseph, he
cannot be sure of anything concerning those
votes except that an exceedingly cold wind
is blowing from their direction.
As a matter of fact, three of the
Labor men have made no secret of
their unswerving hostility to the Ward
Administration, and the subsequent pro-
ceedings largely depend upon their ac-
tion. But, at best, about the only advan-
tage they could take of their position would
be to force another election, for it «is not
conceivable that they would place and keep
in power the Massey party, which, for one
thing, has the bomb-proof hide at this time
of the day to pledge itself to give the option
of the freehold to lessees of lands on lease in
perpetuity at the original valuation. They
might endeavor to make an arrangement
with the Dreadnought plunger that he should
not, for instance, go on any more borrowing
jags. But, even if the pawnshop disease is
not chronic in Ward’s case, the large and
even vast quantity of roads and bridges
member who has given his affidavit that he
will next year see that communication is
established between Cowville and Cabbage
Dog Gully, will want his whack, in return
for his loyalty, when the first pinch comes.
And as the easiest way has been Joseph’s
weakness since he tried to fill the mantle of
dictatorship vacated in 1906 by Richard
Seddon, the dipper will be sent round as
usual to the side door: of Cohen’s financial
pub. Joe’s dissipation, since he became Pre-
mier, may be suspected by the fact
that the public indebtedness increased from
£62,191,040, in 1906, to £81,078,122 in 1911,
being an increase of £18,857,082 in six years.
But a more reliable idea of his prodigal son
methods is obtained by judging them from
the time he got into his stride, which may be
set down at 1908. The national debt in
that year was £66,453,897. In 1909 it leaped
to £70,938,534; in 1910 it bounced, to
£74,890,645, and in 1911 it was waving the
three brass balls round its head to the tune
of £81,078,122, or an increase off £14,624,225
in four years. The shadow of Cohen’s nose
on the wall has assumed such dimensions
these times that even the average citizen
trips over it almost daily, and the constant
tripping of the average citizen will wear
away a more solid politician than Ward.
The unfortunate thing for the average
one was that his choice, was so limited
when he came: to cast his vote. He was
well aware,, or ought to have, been, that,
whatever the Government’s failings, it was
sufficiently Democratic to drive". Fat behind
Massey’s crowd, and, where Fat is .there
shall the boilers-down not be gathered to-
gether —anyhow, not if Fat knows it.
Nevertheless, the necessity of arising to blow
off dissatisfaction was urgent, and, if
Joseph Ward is too old to learn the lesson,
there are quite a large number of people to
whom it ought to be a source of profitable
study. In the meantime, it is doubtful if
either party in the House will be able to
keen a grip on the Treasury benches, and
already the signs of another appeal to the
free and enlightened are discernible on the
horizon. This was the year of jubilee for
Labor, if it had been an organised body with
a definite and compact platform and pledge.
With its scattered forces and conflicting
methods, it is not so . greatly a matter of
wonder that it did not receive more support,
but that it got so much. The sizeableness
of the opportunity ought to at last move the
great mass of the workers to some rapid
understanding with itself, even if it is only
to shoo its quack political physicians off the
premises. After that, it could get work,
and. when one considers the amount of work
there is for Labor to do in Maoriland, the
urgency for getting a move on is in danger
of being fined for exceeding the speed limit.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Johnson and the Alligator.
There is cause for bitter disappointment in
the proposal that Johnson should again sit
on tne alligator in the Northern Territory.
Last time —it seems a good many years now
—that a Federal .Parliamentary picnic went
to the Territory, its sole contribution to local
knowledge was the information that John-
son had rashly settled on the animal above-
mentioned, mistaking it for a log. The jest
wasn’t worth the delay and tne expense.
Now, another useless and foolish and costly
and time-wasting expedition is suggested.
The uselessness stares forth conspicuously.
Allowing for the weeks spent on the two
journeys, the visitors can’t stay many days,
and no useful knowledge of an area of
523,620 square miles can be gained in a few
days. There won't even be time to look at
one proposed railway route, let alone several
possible routes and the adjacent country.
Meanwhile, ail the informaudn which the
picnic won’t get during the brief session of
Johnson’s seat on the new alligator can be
found in books which are available in every
Australian city. They embody the result of
50 or 60 years’ continuous investigation. It
is known that, out of the Territory’s 523,620
square miles, no less than 243,860 square
miles have more than 15in. of annual rain-
fall, and 15in. being regarded as the figure in
which wheat-growing commences, it may be
reasonably interred that there is more wheat
country in the Territory than in N.S.W. or
Victoria or S.A. It is known that, of the
really well-watered part of the Australian
mainland —the 163,870 square miles which
have 40in. or more of rain per annum-
-83,826 square miles, or more than half the
total, lie in the Territory. It is known that
the Lost Province contains some of Austra-
lia’s biggest and most navigable rivers ; that
it owns, in the Macdonnell Ranges, the one
high, cool, well-watered patch of country
that the midland regions of Australia can
show; and that it is a land of great mineral
possibilities. No matter whether it happens
to rain or happens not to rain during the
few days the Federal Parliamentary expedi-
tion will spend looking at the tip of this
great land, and no matter which alligator
the belated Johnson sits on this time, these
facts remain. And, beyond and above all, is
the obvious circumstance that Australia must
put the Territory into direct and quick com-
munication with the rest of the continent
before it can hope to get settlers, and unless
it gets settlers it can’t hope to hold the Terri-
tory very long. Therefore, Australia wants
to get to work at completing the railway
from Port Augusta to Port Darwin, instead
of fooling away time and money on absurd
little visits of inspection, which won’t have
time to inspect worth When the main
railway is built, it will be time enough for
amateur inspectors to go up and consider
where the next lines are to go. Unfortu-
nately, there is a general desire among poli-
ticians to hang up the Northern Territory
business. It is more essential to the safety
of Australia than almost any other question
now in sight. But there are hardly any
votes involved, and votes count for a great
deal. The line to Kalgoorlie, which is not
nearly so urgent as far as Australia’s se-
curity is concerned, had to be shoved along,
else six Senators from Westralia would be-
come angry, and five Representatives from
the same place would give way to excite-
ment. But the Territory only represents
Australia’s future. It stands for no voting
power in the immediate present, so it is a
thing of little account. The Government
hasn’t yet even begun to formulate a settle-
ment scheme for the great, empty land. It
hasn’t begun to seriously consider the rail-
way. Its most active work, so far, has been
to cut down the already scanty mail services.
Otherwise, it hasn’t got beyond a vague idea
of sending up another Parliamentary picnic,
so that Johnson 'can sit once more on his
ancient and horny friend.
♦
The Tenth Year of Protection and the New
Upheaval of Bruce Smith.
A feature of the tariff debate was the up-
lifting of a once familiar voice—the voice of
Bruce Smith. It was a discordant voice,
and a prophetic voice, and a voice calling in
the wilderness, and it vaguely suggested the
voice of Cassandra or Solomon Eagle.
What Bruce Smith had to say was that
Australia would soon become wmary of Pro-
tection, and would revert to the old genuine
fiscal creed. The present ways, it seems,
are all wrong, and the only right ways are
the Smith ways. It is strangely reminis-
cent of far back days when George Reid
was, an alleged Freetrade Premier in N. S.
Wales, and was Staggered about every six
weeks at the amazing rapidity with which
Victorians and others were coming round to
Freetrade. But now, as it happens, N. S.
Wales has come round to Protection, and if
George Reid is still staggered he carefully
conceals the fact in London, and staggers
afar off. Furthermore, N.S.W. has done so
well under the new system that it has very
little time for the Bruce Smith philosophy.
This is the State’s estimated value of gross
production in various lines of industry
during the last year of Separatism and
alleged Freetrade, and the latest year of
Union and Protection :
Gross Output ox Various N.S.W. Industries.
1900. 1910. Increase,
Manufactures .. £24,394,000 £49,615,000 £25,221,000
Pastoral.. .. 13,707,000 21,028,000 7,321,000
Agricultural .. 5,856,000 9,489,000 3,633,000
Cows, Bees, etc. 3,617,000 6,895,000 3,278,000
Mines .. .. 6,362,000 8,455,000 2,093,000
Tree®, Fish, etc. 796,000 1,108,000 312,000
£41,555,000
It is the blessed reword of 10 years’ studious
neglect of Bruce Smith, and 10 years
whole-souled contempt for his political ad-
vice that the gross output of N.S.W. factories
has increased more than the gross output of
all the State’s other industries put together,
though the other industries have also enjoyed
an amazing boom. Furthermore, and for the
same reasons, the gross, output of the State’s
manufacturing industries now totals more
than the gross output of all other indus-
tries put together. .That is something for a
country which is liable to severe droughts,
and badly wants some drought-proof jobs to
save it from going suddenly to the brown
devil of dust when the heavenly water pot
dries up. Ten years ago the employees in
N.S.W, manufactures numbered 60,779,


That was all there was to show for 112
vears of comparative Freetrade, making an
average of 524 added to the list each year.
Vow, after 10 years (Protective years,
1 hough not nearly so Protective as they
should be) the number of employees (in
1910) is 99,746, an increase of 38,967.
That means expansion at the rate ot oBPb
per annum, which is a heap better than the
record of the ancient B. Smith days Fur-
thermore, the wages paid m 1900 to N.h.NV.
industrial workers averaged ±Bl lbs. dd.
per head, which was a very poor E reef™
wage compared with the £B7 2s. Bd. of 1910.
The increase is even better than it looks,
for the proportion of women workers -
always a worse paid crowd than the men ■
has increased immensely, the inference
being that Protection pays women about as
well as the old variety of Freetrade paid
men. So, taking all things into account,
there is very little chance of N.S.W. going
hack to the fiscal gospel of Revenue Tariff-
ism or Freetrade, or whatever the bygone
anomaly called itself. Nothing but appal-
ling ignorance or raving madness will ever
take it that road again. It has, of course,
enjoyed fair seasons of late, but it has the
assurance of the Government Meteorologist
that, fair though they may be, they are
really rather below than above the average,
so it is impossible to charge all, or nearly
all, the new prosperity to that source. Be-
sides, there is the outstanding fact that the
great boom" is in industries which depend
least on the weather and most on Protection.
Therefore N.S.W. owes a stupendous debt
of gratitude to the other States, but princi-
pally to Victoria and South Australia, see-
ing that it was the votes of their represen-
tatives which gave Protection to N.S.VV.,
and brought to it the stupendous influx ot
prosperity which it hadn’t the sense to
acquire for itself, and dragged it out of the
backwash of McMillan’s political folly
and the mudhole of Bruce Smith’s fiscal
incompetence. Even if it presented one of
these States with the Federal capital and
the other with Bruce Smith's head on a
charger it wouldn’t half repay the debt.
Concerning a Costly Farce.
It would be interesting—in the horrible
fashion that a conflagration or a bad street
accident is interesting—if someone called,
in the N. S. Wales Legislative Assembly for
a return showing how many settlers under
C. G. Wade’s Closer Settlement Act are
now in arrears with their instalments. By
multiplying the number, whatever it is, by
two, one could arrive at a more or less
accurate estimate of how many of these
settlers will be stone, motherless broke
shortly after the arrival of the next drought.
“Liberalism’s” scheme for peopling N. S.
Wales with sturdy yeomen is as rotten and
impracticable and uneconomical as the same
party’s Superannuation Fund for railway
employees; and Parliament cannot get wise
to the fact a moment too soon. Consider
the way inquiries as to the value of land
are conducted under this Act. A Supreme
Court Judge is sent up from Sydney to. pre-
side. One of his invariable characteristics
is a bland innocence as regards practically
all land matters. He .is assisted by two per-
sons _ styled “Members of the . Court.”
Nominally, their functions are judicial; in
reality they are barrackers, for the State
on the one hand, and for the people who are
selling the land on the other. Associated
with them are a couple of K.C.’s and their
juniors and a perfect army of “expert wit-
nesses.” The Judge draws three guineas a
day and his expenses (in addition, of course,
to his salary) so long as the inquiry lasts
The “Members of the .Court get from 1-
to 20 guineas a day apiece. The h.O. s »er,
25 guineas or thereabouts, and their juniors
15 guineas a dav each. And the expert wit-
»eJ”s wl.o are, in number, as the:sands on
the seashore, pouch from five to 20 guineas
per day per man. It is obviously to the in-
terests of all concerned to keep thl s J uglily
desirable state of things moving, and, con-
sequently, the average land inquiry is t°n»ei
than a 'sea-serpent and more gradual and
deliberate than a test cricket match. I here
are barristers who have reduced tm® l
ness of stringing out these cases to a fi
art. The nett result is that a Land in-
quiry is liable to cost, when all is said and
done, anything up to £5OOO. It 1S a cunou s
fact that the verdicts, in these cases, are,
almost invariably, for a trifle more than t .
State offers, which means that the land-
owner saves his Costs. Lhe Government
adds the expenses to the price at which the
land is ultimately offered for settlement,
and the prospective farmers pay the btate
for the- lot—that is, they undertake to,
though, as aboveTiinted, many of them are
certainly in arrears now, and most ol tnem
are going to burst financially over the gro-
tesque business in the future. They manage
this business incomparably better and more
economically in M.L. There, each side—
the State and the Landlord —appoints an
arbitrator. There is no summoning ol- ex-
travbtantly-fee’d expert witnesses ; no vast
motor parties composed of Judges, Members
of the Court, K.C.’s, etc., for the purpose of
spying out the land that is under considers,
tion; no portentous hearings that it is
everybody’s interest to prolong. The M.L.
arbitrators mostly know something about
the particular land in dispute—that,_ in
fact, is one of their chief qualifications.
They drift round amicably, and each, ac-
cording to his lights, comes to an estimate
regarding its value. Then they confer. It
they fail to agree they are empowered to
call in an umpire. As a matter ot fact,
however, in all the years that this system
has been in vogue in M.L., the umpire has
never been requisitioned. The basic defect
of N. S. Wales’s “Liberal” device for arriv-
ing at the value of land for the purposes of
closer settlement is that it is too dashed
liberal altogether. What is urgently needed
is a scheme that will grease the stout
lawyer, squatter, etc., less, and save the
would-be settler more.
-<►
A Matter of Sympathy.
The debate on the new Tariff Bill, in the
House of Reps., roused W. E. Johnson, of
Sydney, to sudden and wholly unexpected
sympathy with the artisan. Why Johnson,
of all men, should take up that attitude, when
there are so many other attitudes that John-
son could take up, it is hard to say. Any-
how, this is how an admiring Sydney Free-
tiade paper —known to be Freetrade because
it put up such a heroic fight to keep hold
of the 50 per cent. Protection it used to get
under the N.S.W. free postage swindle —re-
ported him: —
Mr. W. E. Johnson (Lang) insisted that the pro-
posals, though ostensibly to rectify anomalies, would
produce greater anomalies still. It was a purely
amateurish scheme, which would fail to be of any
value except for; taxing people and bringing in re-
venue. The public would soon become so incensed
by the increased cost of living produced chiefly by
thfese tinkerings with the tariff that a cry would
arise for a substantial turn towards Freetrade. The
workers were entirely neglected, and at a later stage
he would move that "it should be a provision that the
increased rates of duty should cease to operate after
a period of three months from the date of their im-
position, unless satisfactory evidence was forthcom-
ing that wages had been increased in industries in
respect of which the increased protection had been
enacted.
It is one of tbe characteristics of the whirling
Freetrader that he isn’t a student. He doesn’t
look up his facts, because he can invent much
more suitable facts as he goes along. Thereby
he gets a big advantage over the opponent
who lias a regard for accuracy, for, by the
time the opponent has looked up the facts
and figures, and made the necessary calcula-
tions to show that the Freetrade person is a
Mttnschausen, the debate is probably fin-
ished, and the subject closed, and the Free-
trader is sticking out his chest in some club
or other, and explaining that his arguments
were irrefutable, because nobody refuted
them. It is very difficult to be ready for
him on the spot, for no one knows in ad-
vance what spot it will be. In this case the
facts are these: In the year 1906 the manu-
facturers of Johnson’s own State (N.S.W.)
had a fund of £11,906,000 with which to
cover wages, rent, fuel, interest on borrowed
money, repairs, bad debts, travelling ex-
penses of bagmen and others, freight on
goods, purchase of new machinery, deprecia-
tion of old machinery and old stock and old
buildings, and to liquidate all sundries, also
to keep themselves and their families. That
amount represented the difference between
the value of the raw material they used
and the finished article they produced. Out
of the £11,906,000, wages absorbed
£5,591,880, so the worker got £46 19s. 4d.
per cent. In 1910, the fund had increased
to £17,015,000, and wages represented
£8,691,386, so the worker’s share had risen
to £5l Is. 7d. per cent. The manufacturer
Ims, therefore, some claim to consideration.
Rents are higher. Interest isn’t decreasing.
He has had, in N.S.W. alone, to add over
£3.000,000 worth to his stock of machinery
since 1906, in order to keep abreast of competi-
tors, and that represents an enormous annual
bill for repair and replacement. And the
proportion of his earnings which are avail-
able for these and many other expenses grows
steadily less. Prices have certainly gone up
and the worker has to pay more for
of Australian manufacture than he
did in 1910. But the wages of the man who
toils ot Australian manufacturing industry
have gone up faster than the price. He gets
a bigger percentage than he did. He may
be ooorer through being robbed by the land-
lord or the importer, but he hasn t been
robbed by the manufacturer. In the aggre-
gate, he lias had the best of the deal so far
as that person is concerned. The farmer
and pastoralist and landlord are on a better
wicket than a few years ago. Things have
improved with them, without any correspond-
ingly large improvement of wages. The
manufacturer is the one man who has, in the
aggregate given the worker a full and liberal
share of the increased values. Therefore, he
is beginning to feel the need for increased
Protection against tbe competition of low-
wage countries. The Freetrade person covers
his hatred of Australian industry by the
plea that he is ready to grant extra Protec-
tion just as soon as he is assured that it
will be accompanied by extra wages. As a
matter of fact, he knows that the extra
wages have already arrived, while the extra
Protection hasn’t. The manufacturer has
done a great deal for Australia under the
new tariff. He has shoved its industries
along more vigorously than any other person
in the community. He has shown by results
that he is more worth encouraging than most
persons. Therefore, he deserves support
against the furious animosity of the anti-
Australian importing gang, which is never
more dangerous than when it professes to be
torn by conflicting emotions of sympathy for
the factory employee. It sympathises with
the factory employee so much that it would
cheerfully see him lose his job altogether.
No sooner had the Commonwealth Govern-
ment corrected a few of the tariff anomalies,
the other day, than S. M. Herald talked
about the good old days of “Freetrade” :
In this State the benefits of Freetrade are still in
the minds of a multitude of housekeepers. It is
their business to get full 20s. value for every sover-
eign, and they remember how much further that
precious coin went 10 years or more ago.
Apart from the fact that the precious coin
was a good deal scarcer 10 years ago, and
that it really doesn’t matter how much you
can get for the coin if yoit haven’t got the
coin to get it with, it is worth throwing a
brick at the persistent superstition or lie
that the increased prices are due to Protec-
tion. Fortunately, the Freetraders them-
selves supply the brick. In March last the
rabid Insurance and Banking Record
supplied a table, based on Sauerbeck’s
“Prices of 45 Principal Commodities for
1910,” and ran out the averages for the last
10 years as follows :
1901 .. .. £93 I 1906 .. .. £lO3
1902 . . .. 92 1907 .. .. 107
1903 .. .• 92 I 1908 .. . . 97
1904 .. .. 93 | 1909 . . .. 99
1905 .. .. 96,! 1910 . . . . 104
“The prices are English,” the Record
added. In other words, in Freetrade Eng-
land, commodities that cost £93 in 1901 had,
as an average, increased in price to £lO4 in
1910. And the Economist, handling the
same subject in the same Freetrade country,
produced this table :
Basis. End of Higher
1901-5. Jan., 1911. p.c.
Cereals and meats . . 500 548 9i
Other foods, etc. (chiefly
Colonial produce) . . 300 342 14
Textiles . . .. 500 609 22
Minerals . . • • 400 423 6f
Miscellaneous . . • • 500 601 20
So textiles, which are almost exclusively
goods of British manufacture, were 22 per
ceni. higher, last year, in Freetrade England,
than they were as an average in the previous
five years, while cereals and meats, which
come mainly from protected countries, were
only 9i per cent, higher. In view of that
22 per cent, rise in the price of textiles in
Freetrade England, the Australian Freetrade
crowd might in decency drop the lie that the
advance in prices in Australia is wholly due
to Protection. The tariff may have piff up
some prices to some extent ; but, on the Eng-
lish experience, it is quite clear that Free-
trade couldn’t have kept for the “precious
coin” the same or anything like the same
purchasing power that it had 10 years ago.

“Belaying Pin”: Justice Higgins’s new
Arbitration award for seamen is humane
and considerate; and shipowners, if they
would only be honest with themselves, would
admit that the terms are merely reasonable.
Under the old conditions a man might work
from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m., then leave the
wharf, and still be called on to do another
five hours without payment for overtime. A
life in which such things were not only pos-
sible, but frequent, could not be attractive;
and therefore I, for one —-and I have had
men working under me at sea for the last
21 years —will welcome the eight-hour prin-
ciple, in the hope that it may induce a sup-
ply of steady, sober Britishers and Austra-
lians sufficient for requirements. The enor-
mous increase in tonnage on the coast this
last five years has, up to now, not induced men
of the right calibre to stay here. The older
men are mostly all right; the newer men
are not trustworthy. Fully 75 per cent, of
them are birds of passage, and frequently
get helpless on sailing day—which is bad for
unionism, the shipowner and the chief officer.
Preference to unionists, may, and I hope
will, be the means of checking these little
capers of Jack. A censure, or fine, or per-
haps suspension, should do something in
minor cases, and cancellation of membership,
as a last resource, would clean out a number
of undesirable men who have crept into the
union, and are doing it the very bad service
of making the officers mistrustful of it. If the
union will put the persistent nuisances and
wasters outside, it won’t have to trouble
much about the preference business —the
union man will get it every time.
“The Old Soldier” : A question that ob-"
trades itself in the midst of the Hoskins-
Paul ironworks row, with all the sullen,
insistent obviousness of a black granite tomb-
stone in a snowballed cemetery, is: Why,
anyhow, does N. S. Wales, rich as it is in
iron ore, coal, limestone and every other
thing needed for the making of good iron and
steel, seem to find it impossible to make
either in any quantity? Italy is not dis-
tinguished for busy industry. We certainly
get the Fiat motor-cars from there, but the
man in the street would not for a moment
suspect it of being a country of great iron-
works. They are in out-of-the-way places
where the ordinary tourist does not go.
There is one on the island of Elba, another
at Savona on .the Gulf of Genoa, and an-
other, the greatest, and most up-to-date of
all, at Terni, hidden in a valley of the
Umbrian Mountains. It began as a small
foundry, working up imported scrap with
charcoal, which was plentiful and cheap.
It fell into the hands of a foreign engineer
about 20 years ago. He spotted a waterfall
close by, and saw what a source of power it
would be. Some Italians floated a com-
pany, and the result is the present works,
which are, according to the Engineer,
among the largest in the world. Here are
some details that ought to make Australia
go green with envy or shame or something:
The new armor-plate mill, the newest installation
at Terni, is a solution of the hydraulic problem of a
reversible rolling train. In practice it is capable of
rolling armor plates larger and heavier than any yet
ordered bv any Government. It, and all the other
rolling-mills, are driven by water-turbines, those of
the new mill making 450 revolutions per minute, and
developing up to 3500 horse-power, with a discharge
of 2000 litres. The mill can deal with ingots of
from 25 to 100 tons’ weight, heated in gas-furnaces,
and lifted by electric cranes.
In the same shop with that great rolling-m«4l are
three vast hydraulic forging-presses, which have
ousted the big 108-ton hammer, the largest of the
kind ever made. Two of the presses are each of
6000 tons potential, and the third of 5000 tons.
The last was installed last year by Davy Brothers, of
Sheffield, for forging the steel coils for heavy guns.
The two COOO-ton presses are used for bending armor-
plates into the curves required for fitting the out-
side of ship or turret.
Rails, guns, armor-plates and projectiles are all
made in one great establishment, supplied with power'
by water-turbines, and the furnaces heated by gas..
Australia lias a fair amount of water-power,,
too, but it isn’t close up against either Ade-
laide, Melbourne or Sydney, and, as all in-
dustries are expected to be there or there-
abouts, what in thunder is the use of the
water-power?

Tasmania is the State which Nature fur-
nished with the best and brightest prospects-,
in Australia. At the same time, it is the
State which Tory misgovernment, the dis-
honest use of loan money as revenue, and!
the foolish habi.t of selling or giving away
every possible opportunity to Private En-
terprise—foreign Private Enterprise for
preference—has made the most backward,,
hopeless and ignorant in the Common-
wealth. It is the pauper and mendicant
among the Australian sisterhood, and for
no visible or possible reason than that it is
bled white to pay interest, rents and divi-
dends on the blessed “influx of foreign capi-
tal.” But the Tory never learns; he
wouldn’t be a Tory if he did. So it is
natural to find the wooden-headed legisla-
ture at Hobart shoving through a fresh
batch of private Bills, by which companies
are to be given extensive rights, in the words
of a leading Tas. paper, to “develop the
waste lands of the State,” and to “utilise
the timber resources of portions of the
island, which, so far, have been practically
useless.” These are days of timber famine,
and days when well-watered land brings
amazing prices. Yet the second most thickly-
peopled State in the Commonwealth is giv-
ing land and timber away, just as a bear
might reject sovereigns, because Tory gov-
ernment has brought about such a condition
of paralysis that these assets are of practi-
cally no use to it. For two or three genera-
tions the isle has watched the Van Die-
men’s Land Co. sitting on its waste _ pro-
vinces, and blocking progress, and driving
away population. Yet it can’t think of any
better idea than to create at the splendid’,
harbor of Port Davey a new octopus like the,
one which squats beside Emu Bay.
«.
The cheerful scheme under which Mel--
bourne’s existing and future tramways,
would be managed by a council-elected!
trust—-in which the city fathers would have?
a dominating voice—is being blown out by-
the various subordinate partners. Even the-
Tory Haw-hawthorn council has drawn upi
a counter-scheme for presentation to the*
coming conference, which provides (1) that all!
lines be vested in a ratepayer-elected trust,,
the latter to automatically snuff out on the*
creation of a Greater Melbourne Council;
(2) every ratepayer to have one vote only;
(3) all trustees to retire simultaneously
every third year; (4) surplus revenue, after
providing for maintenance, interest, depre-
ciation and sinking fund, to be applied to
the extinguishing of the debt and the reduc-
tion of fares, grants in relief of the general
rates to be absolutely forbidden. It is a
good scheme, though it does come from Haw-
hawthorn ; and not the least good part of
it is the provision that comes last. If there
were some such clause in connection with
the city’s electric-light and power scheme,
the Gas Co. would be shaken off its high
horse. But as the clause isn’t there, the
council charges unnecessarily high prices
for current, to the great relief of the Gas
Co., and coolly empties the surplus into the
rate-box, to the further great relief of the
Fat property-owner.

The Official Look-out reports some wreck-
age :
Amongst the stranded, following upon Maoriland’s;
recent election storm, the most prominent is Attorney-
General Findlay, who resigned from the Legislative-
Council, where he was placed by louseph Ward in,
1906 and presented with a portfolio, to once more*
make a try for the Reps. One of the strongest Gov-
ernment seats was found for him at Auckland, and|
the brilliantly-audacious beknighted one hopped northi
from Wellington, and greeted the local inhabitant as;
a long-lost lover. The greeting, however, was a kindl
of one-sided affair, and at its conclusion one J. St
Dickson, a Tory nominee, tacked M.H.R. to his name,
and M.L. was' an Attorney-General short. Fowlds,
who was uninterruptedly sent to the House from
Auckland since 1899, and became a Minister in 1900,
was also sent to the scrap-heap by a practically un
known Labor candidate, named Payne. Quite recently
Fowlds sniffed a gale in the offing, and resigned from
the Cabinet to preach, as he said, “a new Evangel.”
But while he preached the heathen merely raged.
W. H. Field, a tame follower of the Government for
the past 10 years, was also downed by a Labor man,
named Robertson, who sprang up in the night and
knew not Joseph. Also, he didn’t care a pedlar’s
dash.
Another 10-year-older was Hogg, of Masterton, who
some little time back was invited into the Ministry,
and hurried out again after a wrangle with the bosf
concerning a national note issue. Hogg was always
a staunch democrat, and the man who defeated him
is a staunch MASSEY-ite, so it is clear that the public
can be an ass in Masterton just the same as it can be
in Bega (N.S.W.), where W. H. Wood comes from,
or Warrnambool (Vic.), where Yawn Murray is not
understood. Another good democrat swept away was
James 'Arnold, of Dunedin, who has been a represen-
tative from there since 1899, and a hard-working
assistant to Richard Seddon, when that hefty indi-
vidual was hammering together sound legislation for
that section of the people which had been overlooked
by the previous Fat Governments. Plain Bill Jen-
nings, a democrat, but tainted with the roads and
bridges curse, has likewise been turned out to grass
after just on 20 years’ graft as a Leg. Councillor and
Rep.
Of the newcomers, perhaps the surprise packet is
Dr. Newman, one of the old Tory school, who was in
the thick of the game as far back as 1884, when the
Atkinson-Stout-Vogel crowd was carving the bone :
to its liking. He gave it up, or was given up, in.
1896, and until this last election he was considered!
to be politically dead. The resurrection theory re-
ceives a first-class advertisement in his case. And!
when Maoriland’s ancient pawnbroker learns, further,
that old man Massey’s party has floated up from the,
bottom, he’ll have fairly reasonable ground to believe,
that Gabriel has been blowing his front teeth out.
A letter from “Motor-Man” :
Before the N.S.W. Government allocates the shire-
subsidy vote, the Minister who runs the department
should take a flying trip over the Blue Mountains,,
and then ride north and south, and see the way the-
shire councils are neglecting the main roads. And
then he should take the shires by the ear, and breathe
forth the news that unless the main roads are pro-
perlv maintained a large hunk of the subsidy will be
withheld. For, sooner or later, the central Govern-
ment is going to be hit with a huge bill for making
good the main roads that are now allowed to decay,
The Art of Being Killed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the annual meeting of the Peace Society of New
South Wales, the Rev. Mr. Bean expressed feelings
of horror at what he termed the proposal to school
young boys in the art of killing. Nothing aroused
in him keener resentment than to see boys strutting
about in soldier’s uniform, bearing soldier’s arms. —
News item.
I hate the art of killing
Imparted to the kid ;
I hate to see him willing
To do as he is bid ;
I hate to see him strutting
In wicked soldier’s dress ;
I hate to think of cutting
And other warlike mess.
What is the use of teaching
The kid at Sunday school?
Why waste our time in preaching
A gospel kind and cool?
If dreadful laws they fashion
To teach him to defend,
With patriotic passion,
His mum, and dad, and friend?
If war upon our borders
In horrid flame should break,
The kidlet under orders
To dreadful wrath might wake;
And who with words could stifle
Ilis rage if he began
To look along his rifle
At some nice yellow man?
With bullets hotly flying,
And big shells bursting round,
A lot of people dying
Might cover all the ground;
And while the flags were waving,
If our side shot the best,
They might end up by saving
Some parsons with the rest.
But selfish thoughts restraining,
I make a gentle noise
Against this scheme of training
Our numerous small boys
The dreadful art of killing
Should never be instilled,
But we should all be willing
To let ourselves be killed.
If war were really near us,
A little, well-aimed prayer
Would doubtless help and cheer us
And clarify the air;
A little gentle singing
Would save a nation’s face,
The happy foemen bringing
To penitence and grace.
Or, if the heathen sought us,
With steel and flying lead —-
If all unarmed he caught us
And tried to make us dead—
Our cheeks unto the smiter
We ought to offer free.
To make our haloes brighter
Beside the Jasper Sea.

unhindered by as much as a barrow-load of shingle.
I recently did a 400-mile run over the Blue Moun-
tains and beyond. Everywhere men were at work on
the local roads, while the main arteries were neglected
in a most shameful manner. The argument of the
shire councillor is that the main roads are the con-
cern of the Government, which should keep them open
for the good of the whole community, and that it is
unfair to spend ratepayers’ money on main roads
when there is so much to be done on the local tracks.
Yet the shires, with the exception of about two, re-
ceive heavy endowments of public money, some rang-
ing as high as £6 subsidy for every pound raised by
rates. And.the people who put up that money have
a right to expect that some of it shall be splashed
round in maintaining the traffic arteries of the
country generally. In many places, the roads which
were in good order when taken over from the Govern-
ment are already in a hopeless state, being worn
right down -to the foundations, and these are rapidly
being rooted out, after which the roads will disap-
pear. Up north, towards the Queensland border, the
case is very bad indeed. In some cases bridges have been
burned down and left in a ruinous and useless state
for months, while thousands of pounds have been spent
on the paths which lead to the nearest railway
station. This sort of thing cannot go on. While
there is such remarkable unanimity among the shire
councils in the matter of neglecting the main roads,
those highways will continue to go to the Devil.
Ihen, sooner or later, they will have to be constructed
oyer again. And when that reconstruction takes
place, it is safe to bet it will be the Government, and
not the shires, that will foot, or hoof, the bill.
The Totalisator Bill is still the joy of the
N.S.W. Legislature. Recently, after a long,
dark-blue stretch of energetic inactivity,
Harry Levien dashed at the Assembly arid
proved that he had framed a Bill, and was
prepared to pass it for the benefit of the
community and the confoundment of the
suspicious. Then it was suggested that a
select committee should be appointed to
consider the habits of the tote, and decide
whether it was a vegetarian or something,
and this being agreed to, the committee
commenced its studies. But the Christmas
holidays coming on, and there being no hot
springs handy, the committee arranged that
it should be turned into a Royal Commission
and despatched to Maoriland and various
other places to see if Henry’s antagonism
to the bookmaker might not undergo a
change after a course of Rotorua, or
Bruntnell be led to overcome his horror
of the machine by a pleasant sea voyage. It
was remarked to Premier McGowen that
the business would cost the country a lot of
money, but that guileless person opined that
the bill would be quite moderate. The
party, at latest information, was heading
for Auckland with an open cheque in one
hand and a passenger ticket in the other.
And, in Maoriland, it will look hard at the
tote, and get about onertenth part of the in-
formation .that it could gather from the
year books.
“Harrison O.” writes
One of 'the most interesting of one-man art shows
that have, eventuated in Melbourne of late, is Blamire
Young’s exhibition of water-colors at the Athenaeum
Hall. Young deserves attention both as an original
thinker and an original colorist. In fact, he might
be described as a post-impressionist colorist, inas-
much as he gives expression to the effect a scene pro-
duces upon him, instead of painting a sort of kinema-
color representation of it. Young would not feel
bound to paint a green cabbage; he might paint a
cabbage as viewed through his temperament, and if
liis temperament happened to be feeling that way
just then, the vegetable would be of a purple hue,
picked out in crimson. Yet Blamire Young is a post-
impressionist only in the matter of color. He runs
riot with orange, purple, yellow, red and green, but
they are harmoniously blended; and even if he
colored a turnip according to his temperamental ob-
servation of it, he would be careful that it should
have the shape of a turnip, and that there should be
no danger of it being mistaken for a view of Middle
Harbor, or a picture of a general election. The
artist is effective in his handling of the softer colors,
as shown in “Nenuphav,” a delicate composition, in
which low-toned whites and greys fit in with a green
background; and “Evening Symphony,” which is
made up of restful blues. Sometimes his blues shriek,
but only When he means them to shriek. They always
shriek in harness, so to put it, and he can drive five
tints abreast without upsetting the waggon. “A
Harbor Memory,” for instance, is more noisy than a
respectable memory should be, and “Diamond Creek”
looks like an advertisement for somebody’s blue.
Yet no one would have one less noisy or the other
less blue. Two fine agricultural paintings are “The
Horse Team” and “Harvest in the Ranges.” The
former is especially good, both for its coloring and
its economy of line. “Summer Sands” is also notable
for its coloring; some pleasing nudes occupy the
centre of the picture, while behind them is shown the
blue, blue sea. Two fine pieces of realism are “The
Smelters” and “A Wet Street.” In the former, the
glow of the furnaces and the bustle of the workmen
are vividly represented, and if one looked at it for
long, he would become overheated, and feel com-
pelled to'adjourn to the nearest drinkery ; which only
further goes to show how inseparable are beer and
Art. “A Wet Street” is a view of Swanston-street,
looking south. The Town Hall is massed in the fore-
ground ; a solitary sad, depressing hansom is visible
through the mist, and in the background looms the
dome of Flinders-street station. The part of Swans-
ton-street chosen is just the right bit of Melbourne
to select for such a picture. For the rest, the collec-
tion includes some good landscapes, a couple of
paintings of theatrical subjects, several first-rate
views of Sydney, and other items of great merit.
Despite discouraging skies, which have been re-
cently guilty of riotous conduct, the Follies continue
to frivol at their al fresco theatre, on the St. ICilda
(Vic.) Esplanade. One Lawrence is the leader of the
team, and his excursions into comedy are ably
seconded 4 by a party called Leywood, who is circum-
spectly waggish as a rule. Two sentimental singers
are George Stevenson and J. McGowan, and female
warblerS of the serious and semi-comic are known to
the “boys” as Phyllis, Mona and May. Each of
these damsels has now a large bouquet of admirers*
who regularly express their affection with vegetables
plundered from suburban gardens.

“Othello” rampaged across the boards of
Her Majesty’s (Sydney), on Saturday night,
amidst the loud alarms of Verdi’s music.
Melba-Desdemona —who would here be called
Desdemelba for short, if it were not that it
would seem frivolous and perhaps disrespect-
ful—gets her first great vocal opportunity in
the last act of “Othello,” and the “Willow
Song,” with the “Ave Maria” on its track,
count amongst the Skylark’s next-to-Heaven
trills. Her “Ave Maria” (one of the occa-
sional gems in a noisy opera), with its melan-
choly sweetness and soft, sustained notes, is so
perfect in its phrasing that it ought to be per-
petuated through eternity as a star turn for a
feathered choir. After Melba, came the ar-
tistic triumph of Scandiani’s lago—dramati-
cally a magnificent performance. Scandiani’s
conception of a gentlemanly devil was the lago
of Shak'speare in the flesh. Zeni’s “Othello”
was fierce melodrama, diluted with comic
opera. The second act of Verdi’s “Othello”
wants the axe. The death scene shrieks for a
garden roller to smooth out its sharp corners.
Desdemona has hardly time to hop into bed,
and is still hurriedly straightening up the
coverlet, when her blackened husband arrives
far ahead of the speed limit, rushes at his
“sleeping wife” and begins the evening’s
slaughter. The Moor’s dead body, carefully
rolling from step to step in front of Desde-
mona’s bedroom sarcophagus, is opera bouffe.
Quesnel-Cassio meandered through the play
with an. air of mild astonishment. Cassio
had the inconsequent manner of a person who
is looking for the Day of Judgment, or some
other movable feast, and chases it round the
stage in the hope of finding it behind one of
the wings.
“ROMEO ET JULIET ,” AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.
Melba (Juliet) and McCormack (Romeo)
sing of love.
The welcome return of Miss Ethel Irving,
for a too brief season of comedy at the Cri-
terion, attracted a big audience on Satur-
day night. Judging from the expert and
almost condescending gaze of the feminine
audience as Lady Frederick decorates a face
that needs no sign-painting, it may be as-
sumed that Sydney women have nothing to
learn in the gentle art of making com-
plexions. On the other hand, it may be
that their attitude is one of stunned sur-
prise. All Miss Ethel Irving’s elfish charm
is once more noticeable in her playing of the
part of the Irish' widow ; but even her un-
obtrusive art cannot make convincing her
defeat of the dressmaker who demands pay-
ment of her big bill. Even a snobbish dress-
maker would see through the palpable fake.
And she is bought off with the promise of a
lunch that never takes places, as Lady Fred-
erick returns to London the next morning.
After the curtain goes down, Paradine
Fouldes will have the pleasure of paying
that angry dress-manufacturer’s account,
over which he has already lost a wager. As
before, Mr. Stephen T. Ewart unobtrusively
suggests the somewhat decayed but philo-
sophic bachelor with the sense of humor and
the big cheque-book. Mr. Halliwell Hobbes’s
almost perfect portrayal of a distinct char-
acter creation —the Hebrew by the name of
Montgomery—does not get the praise his
work demands simply because he does not
have the sympathv of the audience. Those
few who have not seen a delightful comedy
whose leading characters, at least, are ad-
mirably cast, should hasten to the box office
without waiting to put on their boots. Boots
are mere small dust in the balance where
“Lady Frederick” is concerned.
“Maron, the Ethiopian,” Mrs. Boult’s new
drama, which was lately produced at the
Criterion by the Sydney Muffs Dramatic
Society, is a powerful creation. A re-
markable testimonial to the success of
the authoress was the statement by
the Sydney daily press that the play
made it think. Only genius could do that!
Also, it was a cheerful spectacle to see the
audience, composed largely of the class that
is anxious to import Asiatic house-men to
take the place of Meagre Mary Ann, arise
with an upward bound, like a submarine ex-
plosion, to applaud the sane, sound doctrine
put before them. “Maron” is the story of
lanthe, the blind daughter of King Croesus
of Lydia. She does not marry a black man
because she prefers the color or has no other
offer. Isadis, Prince of Sparta, has offered
to forego the crown if he may have Ce lady
for wife, but she prefers him as a brother.
She has always disliked dark people, but
when Maron, of Ethiopia, drops in to tea at
Sardis, a conspiracy of silence allows her to
marry the murky king, and she returns with
him to Meroe. Later, he discovers, through
an interfering oracle —one of these institu-
tions that Can’t Keep Still —how to give
his queen sight bv applying to her eyes
water from a sacred well. Instead of hav-
ing the wrnll dug up by the roots, and carried
right out of the kingdom, and then thrown
away, Maron takes his wife to the roof of
the palace, and there, in moonlight and in a
rash moment, gives her sight. She has an
instant of joy, and then she flees from her
black husband —over the parapet. The
bump is fatal. With great ingenuity, Mrs.
Boult hammers home the remorselessness of
the argument by making Maron an ideal
character. He is a great king, an enlight-
ened man and a devoted husband, but he
sees his virtues count for nothing against
the pride of race.

there will be no further opportunity of
learning the handcuff get-away. On Satur-
day night the Plimmer-Denniston co. will
produce “Inconstant George” at the Palace.

Bert Levy, the Australian artist enter-
tainer, who draws with vivid white lengths
of twisted lightning, is the best novelty of
the week at the Tivoli. The turn is
smartly mounted and presented. The per-
former strolls casually into his studio in
ordinary street dress and bows. The lights
go out, as he seats himself in front of his
lantern. Still whistling melodiously, he
starts to scratch out a sketch on a small
disc. Each scratch is magnified into a great
white dash on the screen, and the immense
drawing seems to leap together of its own
accord in the gloom. In between times, Levy
writes confidential notes to the audience in
letters of fire regarding such matters as the
unpleasantness of having a boil on the neck,
and the fragrance of the educated chim-
panzee, which occupies the next dressing-
room. George the First, the animal afore-
mentioned, is painfully like a miniature
bounder in deafening clothes. His languid
restaurant manner of chewing is really not
a copy at all, but an original and perfectly
natural performance; in this case, it is the
cheap restaurant human who really gives
the imitation.
Sk
Shamrocks are still sprouting on the bills
of the Adelphi. On Saturday night, Allen
Doone and co. started a week of “Mollie
Bawn,” which drama deals principally with
the poisoning of an old lord by an embit-
tered female relative. As a rule, the female
relative merely poisons the mind of her vic-
tim ; but this is a complete job, and the lord
is dead all over when she has finished. It is
an ignoble way of winding up the aristocracy.
The Religious Editor looked out on Sunday
morning, and saw the man next door pursu-
ing the house cat with fair words and a
deadly saucer of milk. The doomed beast
crawled up on the roof yowling dismally,
thereby advertising its approaching murder
and casting a gloom over the entire suburb.
Lord Amherst, the victim, is executed with
less fuss than that; still he goes out by the
same method. As Ted Luttrell, Allen Doone
enacts yet another irresistible stage lover,
who sings about half a dozen songs ; he also
drags in and performs Robert Emmett’s
speech from the dock during the ballroom
scene. Luttrell is evidently the terrible type
of guest who, being asked to amuse the com-
pany, distends his eyes, scre,ams loudly and
recites “The Blood-Drinker’s Dream” —giv-
ing the first half whilst clinging to the
chandelier pipe, and the second portion from
under the sofa. Edna Iveeley, as Eleanor
Massereene (alias ivlollie Bawn), would be
more delightful if she would try and be less
shrill in moments of excitement. C. It.
Stanford does well as Lord Amherst, until
finished by his niece, Marcia, who is just a
trifle overdone by Ida Gresham.
POTTED OPERA, AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
The classic haircut.—Samson (Percy) being
lured to the woo/shed by D. Liar (Mrs. Can-
not) and the High Priest (Victor Prince).
The Lyric this week screens, amongst
other things, a thrillodrama entitled “A
Fight for Fortune.” Some' cool, splashy,
motor-boat racing pictures help to cool the
superheated eye of the onlooker, whilst
“Jane on Strike” incites him to howl. “The
Siege of Calais,” which gave a job to some
2000 performers, is the plum of the pro-
gramme at Colonial No. 2. The bill at
Colonial No. 1 includes “Through Fire and
Smoke,” which is said to have been taken
during a big New York blaze which was not
started especially for the benefit of the mov-
ing picture man.
“Sweet Nell” Stewart will pursue her way
across the screen of the Lyceum (Spen-
cer’s) for the last time, on Saturday night.
At Sydney Glaciarium (West’s), “A
Woman’s Way” has been leading the com-
peting Sirens of the Surf by one braeeleted
wrist. The Glaciarium seems to be very
strong on curves. The annual beauty com-
petition is approaching, and a film called
“The Power of Love” has been sighted in
the offing.

_ Gus Harris is one of the fairest constella-
tions at the National Amphitheatre just
now. He is a Hebrew of the Israelites, and
should win on points in any honestly-con-
ducted Yid show, for, so far as the writer
can judge, he has all of them. The song in
which he appears to love himself best is
delivered from the portals of a stage taber-
nacle. An urchin has just projected a frag-
ment of blue metal through one of the win-
dows of the house of prayer. Gus emerges,
disguised as a Rabbi or something; and
carols to the erring lad concerning the evils
of anti-Semitism. As he turns sadly away,
the child takes up the chorus of his homily
in a shrill treble, whereat Gus starts as
though nipped by an adder. Small wonder.
The writer would liefer watch this youth
stone a church that hear him sing a chorus,
any day. Arthur Stacey and Emerald and
Dupre deserve cheering words. Bert Gilbert
is in his last nights, likewise Miss Beaumont
Collins and her co., also Armstrong and
male half of which troupe, by
the way, lias a fair claim to be styled the

The venue of the divorce proceedings aris-
ing. from Miss Florence Young’s memorable
train journey, has been changed to Sydney
Royal. Jack Cannot and Percy do a bur-
lesque of the Cisneros allurement act in
“Samson and Delilah ” that would move to
laughter a Wowser who had just received
tidings that he had been made bankrupt, that
M.L. and the State of Maine had unani-
mously “gone wet” from end to end, and that
the Rossel Islanders had renegged on .the
Open Bible question.

The third season of McMahon’s Reper-
tory Theatre in Melbourne was opened with
a performance of “Rosmersholm.” The story
of the fall of the house of Rosmer is no less
gloomy than Poe’s narrative, “The Fall of
the House of Ussher.” Ibsen, a surgeon
skilled in diseases of the soul and mind, lays
his characters upon the dissecting table, and
turns the X-rays of his mind upon them,
and publishes their innards in a reasonable
number of acts. “Rosmersholm” is a fine
example of Ibsen’s craftsmanship, and his
use of the retrospective method. He begins
the story, not at the beginning, or even the
middle, but just before the end, and the
narrative wanders backwards, and perishes
beautifully just previous to the commence-
ment, amid a blaze of human vitals and
burnt souls. If Ibsen had written the Bible
as a drama, he would have opened with the
first chapter of Revelation, then dallied with
Malachi and Jonah, and concluded by set-
ting fire to the front cover which is before
the beginning of Genesis, and would have
poured the Deluge on it just as the curtain
came down, and dropped the ruins of Jeru-
salem on the debris. The acting was not
up to the standard of the previous Ibsen
production, “John Gabriel Borkman.” but.
nevertheless, several good character sketches
were provided—notably McMahon’s Ulrie
Brendel. Miss Rene Tanswell deserves
critical encouragement for the manner in
which she grappled with the difficult part of
Rebecca West; Lawrence Hardinge made
the ;weak-kneed Rosmer an appropriately
gloomy individual; and Herbert Leigh was
fairly strong, but unnecessarily noisy as
Pastor K-roll.

tory Theatre. It is a wonderfully realistic
study of painfully middle-class life. Charley
Wilson, a young quill-driver who has com-
mitted matrimony while in receipt of £9O
per annum, longs to leave his suburban
cabin, 55 Acacia Avenue, and go out to Aus-
tralia, where, owing to the twin curses of
Federation and Socialism, work is plentiful
and pay decent. But he is held by chains
which he cannot shake off. His smug, middle-
class relatives, whose outlook is bounded by
a wallpaper which is horrible in seven dif-
ferent ways, regard his divine discontent
with dull disfavor, and drop platitudes down
on him from a lofty moral altitude. Still,
the spirit of revolt is strong in Wilson, and
he is in the very act of throwing off his
fetters, and leaving for this land flowing
with cow-juice and bee-fruit, when his wife
announces that the services of a midwife
may soon be required at 55 Acacia Avenue.
Thus fresh shackles are forged. Wilson
angrily tramples on his map of Australia,
and, assuming the frock coat and belltopper
of a blameless but unprofitable life, sets off
once agaip for the commercial Darlinghurst
in which he toils. None of the per-
formers \yere deserving of criticism

this paper would willingly have handed bou-
quets to Misses Maud Jolliffe and Isabel

McMahon’s Australian night attracted the
best audience of the season. Four playlets
were presented. “Billy” Moore revived “The
Only Game,” which is intended to
be a trifle light as air. Alf Buchanan
came forward with “The Sacred Flame,”
which is as full of coincidences as
the last act of an Andersonian bellowdrama,
in which the missing will is found beneath
the hearthstone, and the lost marriage lines
blow in through the window, just as the
hero, w'ho is supposed to have been drowned
in the Indian Ocean, steps from an aero-
plane into the 'arms of the heroine and in-
forms her that he found the papers, proving
that he is the earl’s son born in lawful wed-
lock, in the fum bottle, to which he clung
until picked up by the comic sailor, who
happened to be passing that way in a dinghy.
The dialogue, which is on Bernard Shaw
lines, is smart in spasms. Miss Dorothy
Iliscock was the brightest feature of a weak
cast. Blamire Young’s “The Children’s
Bread’’ is a satire on Art for Art’s sake.
Sebastian Branbag, who has given up art
to become a hay and corn merchant, goes to
sleep after a crayfish supper, and has a
nightmare, in which he sees himself as an
artist once again. His offspring are starving-
while he is painting his masterpiece, “The
Children’s Bread,” having explained to the
unhappy kids that it is their privilege to
hunger in the sacred cause of Art. It is a
clever extravaganza, and the dialogue is
full of good things. But the success of the
evening was Louis Esson's “Dead Timber,”
in which the tragic side of cow slavery is
vividly depicted. Things have not been
going well on the selection, and the selector
is weighed down with the hopelessness of
life. Young Joe, his son, has grown rebel-
lious, and is showing a desire to escape from
his serfdom; even A'be, who is “soft,” an-
nounces sulkily: “I’m not goin’ ter take
them steers inter market t’day.” The utter
uselessness of continuing the fight is borne
in upon the harassed selector, and when he
finds that his daughter Mary has “gone
wrong,” he decides that a rifle bullet is the
most suitable solution of his many difficul-
ties. Joe is informed of the “old man’s”
demise, and receives the news with surly in-
difference. Then the distracted widow rushes
to the soft-headed Abe, and tells him of the
tragedy, but his dull brain cannot grasp the
significance of it; his only reply is to again
assert: “I’m not goin’ ter take them steers
inter market t’day”; and the curtain des-
cends on these words. The play is a fine
piece of grim realism —melodramatic, but
still artistic. Esson begins his story just
before the end, thus contriving to crowd the
tragedies of five lives into a single short
act.

Melbourne was given a glance at “Aida”
before the Grand Opera co. moved on to the
Ma State capital. The performance at-
:acked both the ear and the eye, for, as a
spectacle, it was the best thing put on dur-
ing the season. In spite of the fact that it
was manufactured to order by Verdi, “Aida”
is an improvement upon “Traviata” and
“Rigole'tto.” The Melbourne production,
although in some respects little better than
a full-dress rehearsal, was distinctly worth
while. In the name part, the beauteous
Wayda gave a most artistic performance,
and bravely sacrificed her divine fairness so
as to look the part of the Ethiopian damsel.
Zeni made a heroic Redames; Scandiani was
good as Aida’s shaggy male parent; and as
the Ethiopian cat, Amneris, Cisneros
purred satisfactorily, and repeated the Maud
Allan-like posturings with which she lured
Samson to come and get his hair cut. The
co. made its last appearance beside the
Yarra in a programme, the only new
feature being the fourth act of “II Trova-
tore,” in which Wayda made a melodious
Leonora, while Zemi and Cisneros were
harmoniously noisy as Manrico and Azucena.
Her Majesty’s will be reopened next Satur-
day (December 23), when “Sinbad the
Sailor” will endeavor to justify a prodigal
use of superlatives in the advts.

Managerially classified as “a modern mor-
ality play,” “Everywoman,” in which Hilda
Spong was re-introduced to Melbourne
at the Eoyal on Saturday night,
strikes this paper, on a first ac-
quaintance, as a rather dreary piece ot
theatrical sermonising, unworthy of anything
special in the way of encouragement, xlie
characters are mostly symbolical of various
deadly vices or deadly-dull virtues. Acting
on the advice of Flattery, Everywoman, with
Youth, Modesty and Beauty for companions,
leaves home to go in search of Love. Bad
Everyman desired the commodity he would
probably have gone out and purchased it in
the Great White »fay, or ’phoned for it to be
sent along in a taxi; but Everywoman looks
for it in a theatre. She becomes a “star”
and obtains billets for her three companions m
the chorus. Youth and Beauty are welcomed
by the management, but Modesty is as out
of place in the ballet as a dipsomaniac at a
Methodist bun fight, so she is cast into outer
darkness. Being without Modesty, Every-
woman soon appears in a dress which is
mildly immodest, but wildly inartistic.
Wealth, a Yankee millionaire,'and Witless, a
brainless scion of J. Bull’s aristocracy, make
amorous overtures to Everywoinan. Wealth
represents himself as King Love, but a man
with his bow-window effect could not de-
ceive the most guileless damsel, and Every-
woman says, “Prithee, hence,” or words to
that effect. (This “modern morality play” is
full of “prithee,” and “thou” and similar
archaisms.) Then Passion, an obese youth

in bright red tights, represents himself as
the much-impersonated Love; but the color
of his clothes is against him, and he is noisily
repulsed. Then, one night, Beauty dies, dur-
ing the progress of a banquet in Every-
woman’s gaudy apartments; whereupon she
is deserted by Youth, and, of course, Wealth
and Witless have also no time for her.
Finally, Truth leads Everywoman home
again, Modesty returns to her, and she finds
Love waiting for her in front of the fire, after
the manner of the family cat.
* * * *
The dialogue is clever in some spots, but
extremely dreary in others; while the plot
is without real dramatic interest, and is bur-
dened with a good deal of theatrical ism. Miss
Hilda Spong—a tolerably mature Hilda —is
pleasing as Every woman, and acts with
much emotional force. Nobody, who intro-
duces the play and does the useful work of a
Greek chorus, is made an elocutionary some-
body by Eardley Turner, whose impressive
diction fits in with his Dante-like “make-up.”
Arthur Styan makes Wealth a typical Fat-
man, and A. J. Patrick, as Love, does his
little bit well enough. Modesty (Miss Enid
Bennett) is the most satisfactory of Every-
woman’s handmaidens; and the still, small
voice of Conscience is effectively represented
by Miss Florence Quin, who sings a couple of
songs very nicely. Truth, a crippled witcjh
who carries a whip with nine lashes, is played
by Mjss Emma Temple, and Miss Rene
Tanswell flaunts a Titian wig and a large
quantity of stocking as Vice, a lady with a
numerous male following. Good scenery is
supplied by Phil Goatcher and J. F. Hogg.

At the Princess’s, that delicately modu-
lated Marlowdrama, “Under Two Flags,” is
pursuing the uneven falsetto of its way.
George Cross, as Bertie, is a globular delu-
sion and a sweet, cherubic snare; for he re-
tains but few of the characteristics of the
beauteous Life Guardsman. The drawl, the
languor, even the moustache anent which
“Ouida” went into rhetorical ecstasies, are all
missing from the Bertie who nightly sacrifices
himself at the Princess’s to save a brother’s
bad name. Cigarette, who is in the lime-
light most of the time, is made a sort of sou-
bretjte character by Miss Ethel Buckley. At
no time is it possible to take the noisy French
vivandiere. seriously, least of all when she
speaks of the arrival of “the mail from
Kaliss” (i.e., Calais). Among the perform-
ers deserving of honorable mention are
Cecil Mannering, Miss Nellie Fergusson and
Miss Elwyn Harvey.
The King’s Theatre is at present occupied
by “The Female Swindler,” who possesses
the financial morality of a borrowing State
Premier. She is pursued throughout the
greater portion of her nefarious career by a
detective, Jack Coulson, who stands for the
immemorial brainlessness of the blundering
sleuth-hound. The Swindler finally exchanges
her state of single wickedness for one of
wedded biiss with the lamentably incompetent

melodrama, “England’s Hope,” the work of
the Australian Bernard Espinasse, will even-
tuate ; and on the afternoon of Boxing Day
the juvenile panto Co. will take charge with
“Red Riding Hood.”

The best turn at the Opera House is pro-
vided by the Finneys ; and one does not know
whether to praise most the graceful diving of
Miss Elsie Finney (who bears more than
a passing likeness to Lily Brayton) or the
remarkable work of the male Finney, who re-
mains under water for an impossible length
of time, and picks up coins—7s,ooo, or some-
thing like that —with his mouth. Johnson
and Dean sing badly' and dance well, in cos-
tumes /which recall the glory that was Greece
and. the grandeur that was Rome, or words
to that effect. Willie Gardiner presents a
skating turn which is well executed and
wretchedly staged; and Ike and Will Scott,
comedians, win considerable applause for rea-
sons not apparent to the present bored com-
mentator.

Broncho Bill, with the usual ordnance in
his belt, made a.noiseless debut at Spencer’s
Melbourne picture house, on Saturday. Bill
gave a gaudy demonstration, finally wound-
ing the welkin in several places. Of Spen-
cer’s other features, “The Aerial Anar-
chists” supplied fleeting visions of ruins and
human remains; while “The Making of a
Man” unfolded a tale of unkempt love and
an unexpected baby. Incidents in the Dago-
Turk fracas were well depicted in a lengthy
picture, which also included some studies of
Arab dead looking in the distance like piles
of washing.
Kinemacolor pictures are still inviting the
attention of the curious at Melbourne Glaci-
arium. A fresh series of these films was
shown on Saturday, and included a study of
life by the Zuyder Zee, in which the color
results were extremely good. Another hand-
some subject, and an item of wonder to all
the kiddies, was “The London Zoo,” which
disposed of the objection that kinemacolor
could not produce an effective brown. All
the browns in this item, from the golden
browns of the tiger to the burnt sienna of
the big bear, were depicted with perfect
fidelity to Nature.

The chief recent dramatic events in Adel-
aide have been in the hands of the amateurs.
The Appendreena Society, departing from
its usual plan of staging only the well-
known and successful, gave Sutro’s “The
Builder of Bridges” a first Australian per-
formance. The play seems a trifle old-fash-
ioned. There is not a married woman in it,
and the sole interest turns on the question:
Which of a girl’s two lovers will put up
£3OOO to save her brother from prison? The
audience has very little sympathy for her
by the time the bargaining is completed.
Wilfrid Neill and Douglas Walsh, Len
Chamberlain (just back from inter-State
cricket), Miss Ethelwyn Robin, and Miss
Kathleen Sutherland all did good work. The
Literary Theatre put up two delightful ren-
derings of Bernard Shaw’s “Candida.” Miss
Kathleen Lawrence was that sensible lady,
and Arthur Smith her parson husband, who
apologises for saying “Confound your im-
pudence!” The play is true Shaw—never
convincing, and often rather mad, but always
brilliant, and demanding attention. Frank
Johnston was best —having most chances—
as the 18-year-old poet, who will kill him-
self if roughly handled, but who, falling in
love with his hostess, makes honorable, busi-
ness-like proposals to her husband that she
shall be allowed* to choose between them.
Adelaide shows are a little mixed these
evenings. Rickards’s Tivoli has shut off its
Variety, after an unbroken season of some
years, and a Melrose melodrama has come
in. The King’s Continentals no sooner got
started at the Oval than the weather turned
cold, and drove them indoors again. The
Dandies, in the Exhibition Gardens, keep on.
weather or not.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Norbell”: All the artists deluging Melbourne at
present are imported, the latest being a chimpanzee,
delicately called “George I.” Certainly, there is Bert
Levy, but he couldn’t get a decent job as an enter-
tainer in his own country till he went to the other
end of the world, and came back with a certificated
luggage-label on his cabin trunk. Same with Frank
Hawthorne, another recent Opera House performer.
At the King’s Theatre, Bill Anderson gives the native-
born his only chance, though an import plays leads.
Most of the unimported actors are taking to cine,
drama. What I want to know is this: Will the Aus-
tralian Government charter a fleet, and ship the
whole boiling or simmering or spouting of Australian
actors to London, and then instruct Reid to pay their
fares back to Australia, so that they will have a
chance with the other imports?
“Rosna”: One-time Adelaide singer Arthur Otto is
preparing to burst upon London as “Kingston
Stewart, the new tenor.” He was a baritone when
Adelaide knew him, but French polish, for which he
went to Europe, is no doubt responsible for • the
change—in the voice if not in the nanie.
“Cockaigne”: Exit George Lewis, of London, the
lawyer, par excellence. The man of the diary that
never was written, but which would have knocked
Pepys into a cocked hat. An unparalleled law court
man; his specialty was keeping cases out of court.
Occasionally confounded with Sam Lewis, the Yid
money-lender of a kindly kind. George married Kate
Terry, eldest of four clever sisters. The others were
Ellen, Florry and Marion. Florence is dead. Kate
was a popular young actress with the Keans when Ellen
made her debut as little Mamilius in “A Winter’s
Tale,” or Puck in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
I half fancy Ellen takes a year or two off her age.
Kate and Ellen were especially popular together at
the Bath Theatre. Their father was a very humble
actor. Then there is their brother Fred. His
daughter blooms as a star, almost equalling Marie
Lohr.
The Argus gibed at the poor player for his folly
in forming himself into a trades’ union, and his
fatuousness in supposing that anything but merit
could help him in his chosen profession; and while it
thus gibed, the pressmen on the Argus and other
Melbourne papers were forming themselves into a
powerful trades’ union, and smiting the proprietors
with a very knotty “log.” And there has since been
a devil of a row in the Argus office. Evidently the
professional pressman thinks something more than
merit is necessary, whatever he may say in the paper
which is “demanded of conscience to speak the
truth.”
“Harrison O'.”: “Dame Nature” has been given
a particularly foolish “happy ending” for the benefit
of Australian audiences. In London, the deserted
Lolette was sought in marriage by her faithful old
lover, Ridgeway, whom she accepted. Asked by Gar-
ford what he would say to Bertram, Ridgeway replied:
“You can say—say I have picked up something he
dropped by the way, and, by God, I mean to keep it.”
This conclusion was far more natural and effective
than the one provided in the revised version, in which
Lolette, having promised to think over Ridgeway’s pro-
posal, finds that Bertram and the authoress'of his
hot, unruly passion have parted, and speedily becomes
reconciled to her painter-wastrel. There is no artistic
justification for the alteration; and, properly speak-
ing, it can’t even be called a genuinely “happy”
finish. It is doubtful if there would be any perman-
ency about Lolette’s reunion with the prodigal
skunk, were he to again come within reach of the
former siren’s aristocratic allurements; whereas mar-
riage with the steadfast and manly Ridgeway would
be as close up to a sure thing as any matrimonial
proposition that one can think of. In the original
version, by the way, the Princess and the artist were
quite content to take one another for “keeps.”
There is no love lost between the London theatres
and their enterprising rivals, the music halls or
variety palaces. In the new horsey drama at Drury
Lane, “The Hope,” a leading lady character ami-
ably alludes to the music halls as “places where
animals can act and persons can’t.”
THOSE STOLEN CLOTHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A prominent comic onera singer had his clothes
stolen while he was surf bathing at Coogee.
’Tis well! ’Tis well! Malicious joy
Exalts me as I read the “noose.”
No thing can mortal man annoy
Quite so completely as to lose
Those garments which come next the skin,
And those his nether limbs that grace,
And find himself an open sin,
With not a shirt to hide him in,
And pantlcss in a public place.
This fact have comic singers dinned
Into our ears for years untold,
And painfully have people grinned
To hear the sorry jest and old ;
And now a singer in the swim,
Bereft of clothing, stands aghast
Without a “rag” to cover him ;
And all the town applauds with vim
The thief who’s turned the joke at last.

There wasn’t a dry eye in the Perth Police
Court when the second act of a bellow-
drama was played the other day, under the
stage-direction of the S.M. A white girl
was up for frequenting Chinese dens, and
her solicitor stated that one of the Chows
would marry her if she were let go. “If I
thought he was a respectable man, I’d do
as you wish,” snuffled the magistrate. Then
the whole Court fell to sobbing, while the
magistrate thought out the problem of Ah
Sin’s respectability. Evidently, he concluded
that the Chow occupant of a den which har-
bored white girls wasn’t quite the untar-
nished lily, so he gave the girl two months
in a reformatory, instead of the suggested
yellow husband.
“G. Mack” writes about pubs and pub-
keepers :
Alas, for the threepenny beer and the gorgeous
counter-lunch! Another of the temples devoted to
them is doomed. The Duke of Rothesay Hotel, the
only refreshing-place on the east side of Elizabeth-
street, between Flinders and Collins streets(Melb-), is
to go. The pub is over 50 years of age. All that time it
has dispensed cheer and beer. Even when the big
fire swept the block in which the pub stands, about
13 years ago, it seemed to take pity on the Duke.
The roof fell in, and a wall of an adjoining ware-
house fell on it, and the place was wrecked, but
there was enough left to keep a temporary bar going,
so the license remained afloat.
The place used to belong to George William Petty,
a money-making person, who half a century ago re-
tailed dead sheep and cows to the people of Mel-
bourne. His business was in Bourke-street, where
W. Angliss and Co. now dispense fleshly odors around
the neighborhood. Petty got tired of killing things
and selling dead meat, so he bought the Maribyrnong
stud farm when C. B. Fisher and Hurtle Fisher had
had enough. There Petty bred blood stock for years.
He had three sons and four daughters, and when he
died the estate was cut up. The Duke of Rothesay
went to the daughters. Of recent years Charley
Memmot had his billiard-room there, and ran one of
the first standard tables in Melbourne. The place
was for a long time the resort of big break men, who
came to try conclusions and learn wrinkles from the
amiable Charles. Latest of all, A. A. Farthing, the
present State "member* for -East Melbourne, took over
the pub. His method has been to take hotels which
were out at elbows and frayed at the heels, patch
them un, clean them up, and then sell out at a profit.
From the Duke of Rothesay he stepped into Parlia-
ment, booting Henry Weedon out in the process.
Farthing himself has an odd history. He has been
a school-teacher, professional pedestrian, and a hotel-
keeper. Now he is a legislator. He has been paying
£lOOO a year for the pub, and they offered him a
new lease at £l2OO if he would spend £2500 in re-
pairs, for the Duke has been getting a little bit
shabby since the lessee took to politics. Farthing re-
fused, and the owners sold over his head to Craig
Williamson, who intend to. spread their premises over
the site at a cost of £lO,OOO.
The Duke of Rothesay, under the Farthing regime,
has been noted for the best and most varied counter-
lunch in Melbourne. Dozens of dead-beats have lived
well for the last two years upon the “feeds” they got
there. : The old story, of course. Slip in when the
bar is crowded, pick up a beer glass with the dregs
in it, drain these, and, glass in hand, attack the
counter-lunch in flank. Threepence is saved, a meal
is gained, and the flavor of beer kept green in the
memory.
From “Rosna”
in London :
Excuse my ignor-
ance, but can any-
body tell me what
th e Commonwealth
Kiosk represents? I
wandered into the
White City the other
day, and having visi-
ted South Australia
(a howling desert in
which a lady and
gentleman are shak-
ing hands before a
shockingl y-con-
structed haystack)
and Sydney (a toler-
able picture of the
harbor as it must
have looked 20 years
ago), 1 came to
“ the Commonwealth
Kiosk.” It is a ro-
tunda, apparently
situated in the mid-
dle of the Never
Never, and sur-
rounded by about 50
people, dressed for
the Melbourne Cup,
with their umbrellas
up. At a little dis-
tance there is a
, , ~ , group of pilgrims,
who have evidently dropped in from America
and the Middle Ages. T thought I knew the
geogranhy of my native land fairly well, and if there
is a rotunda in the Never Never I think I should have
heard of it. What does this “Commonwealth Kiosk”
mean ?
The story of Australia’s own Dan O’Con-
nor and the Countess has arrived by cable-
gram, and it doesn’t shed much light on
itself. The Countess is said to be exceed-
ingly beautiful, and to have £12,000 a year.
Presumably she is the same countess that
Australia used to hear about in the days of
Dan’s previous refulgence. Dan says, or
the Age says he says, that she would gladly
have married him, and that if she hadn’t
been a Protestant he would have married her
10,.000 times over —which seems numerous.
Dan, however, couldn’t “part with the splen-
did associations of the Holy Roman Em-
pire”—wherever that may be. There is a
certain uncertainty as to what would have
happened to Dan if he had married the
Protestant lady with £12,000 a year 10,000

her designation is Hamil de Manin—under
threat of “publishing letters to her annoy-
ance.” There is no information' as to the
contents of the letters, except that they
were perfectly harmless, and the nature of
the annoyance isn’t specified. The Countess
said that Dan didn’t write them, and if
there was any annoyance about them, it is
certain he didn’t, for the chivalrous D. O’Con-
nor never annoyed a lady, especially a beau-
tiful one, in all his romantic existence. The
letter (it is difficult to find out whether there
was one or more) is said to have been
written to, or about, the intended mother-
in-law of one Dobbie, who is a misty sort of
figure in the narrative. At one point in
the series of events, whatever these events
may have been, the Countess is said to have
been in a state of collapse, though where she
collapsed is difficult to decide without the
aid of diagrams. Previous to this, she was
“taken to the office of the prisoners,” but
whether she was taken in a cab or dragged
through Cheapside, the Strand and Leaden-
hall-street by the hair is another matter. It
is all brief, unsatisfactory and cablegram-
matic, but the story is surrounded by a rich
haze of poetry and sentiment, and the figure of
Dan shines in the midst of the radiance.
Daniel was always a whale for poetry.
Justice has been tardily done on paper to
Captain Attwood, who commanded the
Elingamite when it went to fatal and eter-
nal smash on the Three Kings, off the
Maoriland coast, eight years ago. It has
transpired lately that the Three Kings were
wrongly located on the chart; if they had
been rightly located the course which Cap-
tain Attwood set that foggy night would
have carried his ship clear. So his smudged
certificate is cleaned by the Maoriland
Court, and he is handed a pot of white-
wash and a completely repaired character.
But the skipper whose professional reputa-
tion has been obliterated by mistake is very
like the man who has done £0 years in gaol
by mistake, and has then been released, and
apologised to, and given a public dinner with
turtle soup. Somehow only one person
seems to hear of the rehabilitation for 100
who heard of the original disaster. And
the intervening years are gone, and the
salary and the chances that should have in-
tervened are also gone. The case is one for
a solid cheque by way of visible compen-
sation.
“Vic” : The last omnibus has just disap-
peared from the Melbourne suburbs. It is
difficult to fix the arrival of the first. Be-
tween 50 and 60 years ago the ’bus was
already providing the pleasant way for busi-
ness men to bowl into town. Conran’s four-
horse teams, from Upper Hawthorn, were
popular; and Kew, St. Kilda and Brighton
had their fine turn-outs. Then there were
the rival caravans of Fulton and Ford, ply-
ing to Fitzroy and Collingwood. Later on
every ’bus was driven off the road by the
cabs, until the new company started in
1869. It served all the suburbs, and pre-
sently made a bargain with the munici-
pality to substitute trams. The company’s
first ’buses came from America, where they
were made by Stevenson, of New York.
THE HAPPY DRUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To-day is “the withdrawal of drummers” day.
Practically every city firm’s travellers return from the
country with the last orders of the year —News item.
The drummer leads a happy life
In Trade’s well-nourished van ;
Remote from home and office strife
He plays his rataplan.
Beyond the reach of wife or boss
He sails and rails first class;
Or bumps behind the cabby’s hoss
Large orders to amass.
The grass grows not beneath his boots,
But whisky gaily sprouts,
And good yarns circulate ’mid hoots
When good old “Ex’s” shouts.
The publicans are joyous friends,
The cabbies are good chums,
His life is gay where’er he wends
And soap or saucepans drums.
His thin gold line of barmaids goes
Half-way across the State ;
He knows them all! He knows ! He KNOWS ! !
And calls each “Kid” or “Kate.”
Home sees him only at week-ends ;
On Friday he comes down
To see his wife and other friends
And meet the Boss in town.
His children sit upon his knee
(They rarely get the chance),
And —this is beautiful to see! —
Round their strange parent dance.
His wife shows him the house and fowls,
And gets a meal or so;
But, ere she gets off any growls,
It’s time for him to go.
He packs his bag with skilful haste,
And sounds the cab alarm.
No leisure time lias he to waste !
Sweet home has lost its charm.
The whistle hoots—the siren calls,
The gay road flings its spray ;
Into the world that never palls
He steams from care away.

THE JOY OF EATING NOTHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The advantages of the fasting cure are now widely
known throughout Australasian— Daily paper.
Deeply I breathe the rich Australian air,
My plate is empty as my heart of care,
My simple breakfast all the world may share
From day to day;
I eat not any herb nor crusted bread,
For me no cauliflowery bloom is shed,
The pumpkin sleeping in its humble bed
I will not slay.
No bird that soars upon the lofty wing,
No rooster waking in the morn to sing,
Nor fatted duckling shall ye hither bring
To cook for me ;
The trout may dwell within his quiet brook,
The sea-fed oyster with a shady look
May stay unopened, and the baited hook
Forsake the sea.
I will not eat of beef bedewed with brine,
I will not taste the larded flesh of swine,"
Nor on the cutlets of young muttons 'dine ;
At noon or eve;
Although the market price of eggs be down,
Though golden comb in sweeter honey drown,
I pass the lush temptations of the town,
And shall not grieve.
But morn by morn I breakfast on rich air,
And dimpled fruits of poets’ fancy rare,
And moony-whiskered dreams that comets wear,
And all high thought;
Crisp plates of Plato, chops of Shakspeare’s mind
Old devilled kidneys Milton cooked when blind,
Scoth haggis on which Burns and Ossian dined,
With coffee bought
From Omar Khayyam’s shop across the way.
These shall my heart sustain and hunger stay,
Till fine as sunbeams on the mountain way
My soul is wrought.

FOR A MAN
THIS CIGAR CASE.
Here’s the Gift a man would choose for
himself —a Gift that would be the smokers’
constant companion, and keep you in con-
stant memory as the giver.
It’s a fine Cigar Case, in both fancy- or
smooth-grained leather, strongly made with
a hinge at back and clasp in front. It holds
12 cigars, and has strong leather linings, and
two large gusseted pockets.

“ Button-Stick ” : The anti - militarist,
anti-defence, anti-any-old-darn-thing party
held a most successful demonstration at the
Town Hall in Wellington (M.L.) t’other
night. There were one or two items put on
which the anti crowd hadn’t reckoned upon,
but they helped the evening along wonder-
fully. A number of the down-trodden vic-
tims of compulsory training took care that
there should be no tired feeling about that
parade, anyhow. One orator orated pas-
sionately that “18,000 lads had stepped into
exile, and 13,000 daughters of Maoriland
are to be robbed of their natural mateship.”
The conductor of the soldier-slaves-exiles
present waved his baton, and promptly the
solemn chant arose: “There was I, a-wait-
ing at the Church.” The orator’s further
attempts had to take a back seat till the
final triumphant outburst of “My Wife
Won’t Let Me”; and before he could get
into his stride again the gallery rolled up
with the hymn of “O Happy Day.” Then a
lady, who violently declared that Lord
Kitchener was the Czar of Maoriland, had
to sit back while three uproarious cheers
were given for “The Czar —God Bless ’lm,”
and the chorus firmly vociferated that “He
Is a Jolly Good Fellow.” When the chair-
man rose to remark that he wished to pass
a resolution he was implored “not to pass—
to go nap,” and on going on to say that
“This Meeting Declares” a voice inter-
jected “NO Trumps,” and the chorus
asserted loudly that “Clubs —Clubs —Clubs
Are Trumps.” After that the down-trod-
upon troops that all the sympathy was
being gushed over took command of the
meeting, and, amidst hurricane cheers, an
amendment was passed that “A system of
compulsory training was essential for the
defence of Maoriland,” and was a darn
good thing, anyhow. The anti-Defence party
has been clamoring about the strong feeling
in Wellington against the Defence Act, and
this demonstration was held to give voice to
it. Evidently the Voice will have to use a
megaphone if it wants to make itself heard
in its own house, or it will have to lock out
the poor soldier-serfs who are represented
as yearning for their freedom from the
goose-step. Either that, or it will have to
go into strict training itself and its apostles
must attend their meetings with a half-
brick in the corner of a hanky to enforce
their peaceful proposals.

THE SPORT: "Hello, little girl! Would you
care to join me in a cup of tea? ”
THE FLAPPER: “No, thank you. I object to
mixed bathing."
By The Bulletin’s Official Philoso-
pher :
In the majority which has grown from a minority
there is much wisdom; in the minority which is
slowly forming a majority there is most wisdom ; in
the minority that has dwindled from a majority
there is no wisdom at all. The political opinion of
a community may be likened to a cigar. The light
begins at the far end, the middle gives most of the
smoke, and the Tory butt-end, saturated with -nico-
tine, never knows the light.
“Vagabond” : The desertion, by the Orient
line, of Marseilles in favor of Toulon, quoted
by The Bulletin (16/11/T1) as an ex-
ample of the readiness of shipping
cos. to go where the dues are cheaper
or handling facilities better, is strik-
ing in its way. But still more so is
the recent chucking of Liverpool by
the White Star Co. in favor of South-
hampton. For generations the trans-
Atlantic monsters of this co. had
been using Liverpool as a terminus.
The White Star people must have had
vast interests there, to say nothing
of established trade, and an accumu-
lation of conveniences. Scenting the
coming trouble, Liverpool franti-
cally deepened its ditches, straight-
ened out kinks in its fairway, built
wharves, ran dock railways—did, in
fact, every mortal thing it could to
keep itself in the front row as a
port. But Southampton offered deep
water accommodation, easy access
and egress, convenience to other
centres, and so on. And so the change
came. There seems to be no reason
why some of the neglected deep-
water harbors of Australia should
not suddenly be discovered to be
preferable to Melbourne or even Syd-
ney in spite of the Sydney merchants’
recent remarks that Sydney MUST
renmin the “front door” of Australia.
And, anyhow, I’ve no doubt that the
unused ports would not have any objection
to Sydney or Melbourne or any other place
remaining the front door if they were
allowed to hang out the sign, “Tradesmen’s
Entrance.”

“Brass Button” drops a briny tear: —
I wonder how many of the hundreds of passengers
who sailed to or from Maoriland in the fast clipper
Dunfillon would recognise her in the dirty, unkempt,
ill-cared-for “guano barge” Mataura that has just
arrived from Seychelles, and is now polluting the
atmosphere at the King’s Wharf in Wellington Har-
bor. She was a full-rigged ship in the ’Bo’s, when
she flew the red ensign and hummed along the Roar-
ing Forties “running her easting down,” with the
white foam Purging along her lee rail, her black sides
and painted ports glistening, and every stitch of can-
vas that could be piled on her pyramided
above the snowy decks and winking brass-
work. She was given her Maori moniker
when she was bought by the N.Z. Shipping
Co. Since then, she has slipped down the ladder to
grimy slutdom, and has been turned into a barque
by the present Norwegian owners. She is a sad sight
to a sailor or a lover of the old sea-beauties.
The Law in the Weary State is again in-
dulging in the pleasantry of gaoling persons,
mostly women, for having no lawful means
of support, and then arresting them immedi-
ately on their release and gaoling them some
more on the same charge. Even Coburg’s
usually complaisant b6nch of honorariums
kicked, the other day, when Mary Jane Fuller
—Fuller wasn’t her name, but it will do—
was introduced to it for the severalth time.
In every case her “offence” was the same —
poverty —and she had just finished a >'2
months’ sentence; but as she was a “frail-
look' ng, worn woman of 67,” and the Penf-
ridge doctor said she was mentally weak
and unfit to take care of herself, the beaks
reckoned it was hardly good enough, and
set about getting her into a home. Ilow the
Law expected her to acquire a competence
in Pentridge, seeing that no prisoners are
provided with remunerative employment,
that ass didn’t condescend to explain, and the
boss of the penal department is in a per-
manent state of sleep, and the head of the
Law department is too busv remitting well-
deserved sentences; but Treasurer Willie
Watt, who has to find the money to pay for
this foolishness, may want to know why the
Law persists in these thriftless jokes.

Old Samuel Peacock, the Melbourne doc-
tor who was sentenced to death for the
alleged murder of the woman whose body
wasn’t found, has had his conviction
quashed by the High Court after failing to
get any satisfaction from the State Judges.
It is not known whether there will be an-
other trial, but the Federal Chief Justice
recommended that there should not be, and
his recommendation will doubtless carry
weight. Old Peacock calls for admiration
in a way. If his patient was dead, he, of
course, didn't want to produce her. She
would, in these circumstances, be the most
unproductive object lie knew of. If she was
alive, he plainly failed to find her. So
Peacock relapsed into silence when verbal
traps were laid for him. That is to say, he
relapsed into silence when the detectives
wanted him to enter into brilliant conversa-
tion about the alleged body! lie was will-
ing to offer opinions about the weather,
based on 70 years’ experience of weather, or
to discuss art, politics or drama, but as
regards the other matter he mostly just
smiled. Doubtless, being a wise old medico,
he realised that innocent men have talked
themselves to the gallows, but guilty ones
seldom conversed or jabbered themselves
away from it. If N.S.W. Attorney-General
Holman had been half as silent about die
Willis agreement as Peacock was about the
supposed body, things would have gone
better with a harassed Government.

Cornelius Delohery, sen., was a Sydney
magistrate who, at 57, was appointed a Pub-
lic Service Commissioner. In three years he
reached 60, a natural circumstance. When
60 he threw up the Commissionership. As a
magistrate, Delohery, sen., drew about £7OO
a year, and when promoted to P.S.C. was
given £lOOO, and drew it for various years. He
retired about 1909. Delohery, sen., has a
son —Delohery major, a barrister —and an-
other —Delohery minor, a solicitor. Delo-
hery major and Delohery minor worked it
out that Delohery senior “retired from the
Service” when he reached 60 years of age,
and was entitled to a pension of (say) £5OO
from then. The Government remarked that
the salary of £lOOO paid to him as Commis-
sioner included the £5OO pension. Deloherys
senior, major and minor all said it didn’t,
and on appeal to the Full Court the Delo-
hery triumvirate carried their point. They
also carried £4400 back money for Delohery
senior, and costs against the Crown (on the
highest scale) for major and minor. The
disordered Crown has now fled back to its
chambers, to find out how many more ancient
public servants have lawyers in their fami-
lies.
The time-payment wife has a precarious
hold on this planet; her home is, as it were,
hitched to a financial balloon which may be
released by the simple process of spending
one instalment on beer. If she has a row
with the boss, and
he gets wild and
curses the instal-
ment collector, the
furniture chases it-
self out of the place
and goes home.
Then she is left sit-
ting on a kerosene
tin in the midst of
a few ill-assorted
fragments. In Mel-
bourne, the other
day, a little home
blew up, and the
wife found herself
stranded with a
meat safe, a fender
and a bit of oil-
cloth. Even the
bustling hen that
had hopes of hatch-
ing a skyscraper
out of a brass door-
knob would have refused to sit in a busi-
ness-like way on that jagged and cheerless
collection.
A PERFECT GENTLEMAN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A gentleman should not place himself in a posi-
tion of risking a brawl, hut, if under exceptional
circumstances, a personal encounter is unavoidable,
let him, in the words of Shakspeare, “Stiffen his
sinews, summon up the blood, disguise, fair -nature
in hard favored rage,” and rush at his antagonist
with the first weapon he can lay his hand to.
I am, etc., Excubitok.
—To Editor of Great Daily.
A calm, reposeful manner, and choice diction are
delectable —-
And hence it is a gentleman affords a pleasing spec-
tacle !
A man who blends good taste in dress with passion-
ate sobriety
Should be considered, more or less, the Model of
Propriety!
If, meeting ribald persons, he’s unable to admonish
them —
In certain circumstances he’s entitled to astonish
them !
Recalling all he ever read in days of his precocity,
Let him proceed to summon up his blood with dire
ferocity !
And though the odds against him show an ominous
disparity,
l*et him chastise those ribald folk for their inane
vulgarity!
This is the time a gentleman will always show his
metal true
By hurling at the ribald clan Some well-aimed lumps
of metal blue.
Or, if the scene’s a picnic beach, where broken stone
does not abound,
It may be, within handy reach, the Bottle or the
Pot abound !
Or, failing these, an Iron Bar —the fact is inescap-
able —
Makes ribald folk see many a star, and renders them
incapable!
An axe, a club, a carving-knife—a common kitchen
poker, too,
Can all be used with great effect to bring the ribald
joker to !
The ribald persons’ bodies must be hid—howe’er
laboriously—-
A gentleman will always strive to do these things
decorously !
But p’r’aps ’twere best —-supposing that your
Dignity’s imperilled, say—
To chastise ribald persons through the Sydney
Morning Herald, say!

A SLIGHT MIS-
UNDERSTANDING.
SAM THE SHEARER (on the
hurst, to curate on his way to
croquet party): "Struth, ’ ere's a sport at last. If yer lookin' fer a game of polo, mate,
I'll play yer over in Casey’s paddock fer drinks."
“Taramat T.” : Now that everybody else
has failed to provide an antidote for ants, permit me
to settle the matter. All you have to do is to remove
the upper storey of the insects’ domicile, cover the
rest of the structure with a layer of straw and replace
the dirt that was taken off. I’ll back that to drive
capital out of the country against any other scheme
in Australia. Straw is the ant equivalent for
Sosh.
From “X.P.D.” :
I have spent 20 months in Papua, and can endorse
the remarks of your correspondent (B. 19/10/11)
concerning the unwisdom of financially squeezing the
white settlers of that wild spot for “the benefit of
the natives.” If £23,467 per year is really spent
“to provide black brother with some of the benefits
of civilisation” —well, it’s a case of burning good
money. If you want to transform a more or less
decent Papuan nigger into a confirmed loafer, waster
and blighter, you have only to start the process of
giving him something for nothing. I found the really
wild people of Papua invariably honest, hard-work-
ing, well-fed from good gardens and skilfully engin-
eered hunts, and alert and commendable in regard to
the village birth-rate. On the other hand, the native
peoples I knew (save and except Taupota boys) that
had much to do with whites were rogues to consider-
able extent, invariably lazy, gorged when the white
man handed out the pura-pura, and part-starved the
rest of the time, neglectful of gardens and wives and
—despite the Government having blocked massacres —
indifferent cradle-fillers. The much-photographed
Port Moresby villages, lasi-lasi (on the north-east
coast), and Wedau, where the head station of the
Anglican mission is,' show these contrasts sharply.
Those three localities see more of whites than any
of the few dozen others I have been at (bar Yule
Island, but there the R.C. missionaries deal with the
native without trying to make him an imitation
white man). The Moresby crowd are weedy, and too
lazy to work now that tourists’ tobacco is easy to
catch. lasi-lasi is one great Yoshiwara, with conse-
quent leisure for the males, and the Wedau people
are miserable specimens. I exempt womenfolk from
the charge of idleness, for the men keep them up to
the collar.
Shareholders of the many rubber ,companies, now
more or less afloat in Papua, may think that, out of
its couple of hundred thousand population, there will
be plenty of labor for the plantations. Not so, how-
ever. New Guinea boys (bar Taupota again, and an
odd lot here and there) are of little use; for con-
tinuous work. Shipping them away from their own
villages invariably means awful home-sickness (some-
times they die of it), and is, consequently, more cruel
than the life Jack Johnson’s ancestors led in America.
It should, by rights, be forbidden. Again, trying to
get any considerable quantity of regular labor from
near-by villages is hopeless, for one day’s pay means
a week or two’s smokes, and few natives will work so
long as there is a pipeful left.
“Billy T.”: I met a “near” thing in
James Minchet, of Weewee. James held a 320 : acre
block in the wedge Of two creeks —320 acres of
excellent land that grew gums and rabbits. How
Minchet and his large family sustained life before
we took along the sawmill, Heaven alone knows ; but
there were hundreds of fine sticks on his selection,
and we paid James £4OO for the milling rights.
When the final cheque was to be handed over, Minchet
opened his heart quite wide —he invited me up to tea.
I went. You literally waded through rabbits to reach
the selector’s three-roomed humpy. Put a dog into
any hollow log, and rabbits would spurt from the
other end, like water from a hydrant, and they were
so free and familiar they lived in scores under Min-
chet’s house. At a pinch, you might have trapped
a brace under Minchet’s bed. We had roast rabbit
for tea, Minchet, I, Mrs. Minchet and the nine little
Minehets. Willie Minchet was first through his little
lot. “Please, dad, can I have some more rabbit?”
piped the small toy. “Wh-a-at?” cried Minchet.
“More rabbit?” said Willie. “More rabbit!”
squealed Minchet. “More rabbit! Good God, do you
want to eat me out o’ house and home?”
“Dal”: I may bo lato, but I've come a
dashed long way to have a chip at this liard-wood
competition. I’ve had “Douglas” in my hands for
about 15 years, bar meal time, and nominate dry
belar as the hardest to fall and log off; also the
roughest on axes. I’ve tested it at Mildura (Vic.)
and Wyalong (N.S.W.). About two chains away
from my present camp is a two-foot diameter dry
belar, which, over a wager, knocked out a “Kelly”
and “Plum” in about three minutes. If “Odor” will
send a camera along, I’ll post him photos. The
axes would be no good to him, and it would be rather
inconvenient to send the tree. I’ve seen lightning
rebound from dry belar with a broken neck, and
smash itself in three pieces. The reason why the
Devil is lame is that he struck a belar when he fell
out of Paradise. The belar wasn’t injured, but it
was a devil of a time for the Devil.
FORETHOUGHT.
APPLICANT FOR JOB : “Can I get Bill Jones's place what was killed yesterday , d’ye think?"
PESON ON TOP: “Oh, res. I 'sped so. Who’s your undertaker?”
“Murrinji”: From country little known,
I’d like to tell brother bushwhackers about three
hard timbers which few of them, probably, have run
across. The first to receive honorable mention grows
in the ranges between the Thompson and Dimantina
rivers, alid' is called by the inhabitants, “Mountain
napunyah,” Its, tall, straight lengths readily lend
themselves to any bush work, but how long the wood
will last in the ground I ; can’t say. All I know is
that some cattle-yards, built with it over 40 years
ago, are still as sound as the day they were framed.
Another tough customer in the same locality is the
minaritshee, or red mulga ; it is as hard as my luck
at the races. The third hard case grows in the
Northern Territory, and ,is called “bullawaddy” by
the natives,' who make all their weapons from it.
Between Newcastle Waters and Victoria River there
are great forests of it, and Binghi’s unanimous
opinion of the wood is: “Can’t breakum.” Binghi
is a good judge, too. .
“J.S.”: “Mallarapoonie” said that jarrah
is the only timber that defies the tpredo, or sea-
borer ; and “Montalex” backed him tip. Both are
wrong—or, at any rate, both are under suspicion of
being wrong. Talking about the big. cost of Wes-
tralian jetties, the local Premier said the other day:
“It was thought that selected jarrah, iri cool waters,
possessed sufficient powers of resistance to this des-
tructive pest; but it appears that for marine pur-
poses there must be an abandonment of implicit
faith in jarrah, as was the case in regard to karri.
The Government was considering the question fairly
in the interests of the timber trade and of the tax-
payers generally. It was a bad advertisement to
have to deal with jarrah like that, but it was worse
if, every eight or nine years, the wharves’ had to be
rebuilt.” So, like the gentleman who is suspected
of growing snakes in his hair, the jarrah bad better

“Recoil”: Randolph Bedford, in his “Sal-
vors of the Planet Venus” (B. 9/1 l/'ll), repeats a
" popular fallacy when he. says: “Dynamite! Dyna-
mite, which always does its greatest damage down-
wards.” Now Bedford knows more about mining
and a good many other things than most men, and
that he should voice such claptrap is annoying. Dy-
namite and its more aristocratic relations, gelignite,
gelatine dynamite, and blasting gelatine—all nitro-
glycerine compounds—in practice strike equally in
every direction. In theory they strike upwards. An
explosion is simply rapid burning, and in a perfectly
compounded blow-up mixture every atom of carbon
will find, ready at hand, just sufficient oxygen to re-
duce the lot to carbon dioxide, which, being a gas,
applies its pressure equally in every direction. In
theory, the gas, being hot, wants to rise. Explo-
sions are, however, sudden affairs; hence the liber-
ated gases, forgetting theory, wade in with hands
and feet simultaneously. Some idiot is bound to
remind me that a drop of water poured into the drill
hole will hold the infernal stuff by its front hair
while it “deals it out” to the rock; hence it must
strike more down than up. The fellow who is going
to blow me out with that argument had better con-
sider the effect of, roughly, 151 b. of atmospheric
pressure on top of the water. But why should Bed-
ford blame dynamite, anyhow? • The most experi-
enced cannot tell by the result of an explosion which
member of the nitro-glycerrne family struck the
blow. You might as well endeavour to recognise a
cremated man by looking at his ashes.
“Whipsaw” : Bullocky Bill’s ability as a
curse-purveyor is over-estimated. I never yet knew
a bullocky to get his team out of a fix by rhapsody
alone. Was travelling with an assayer in North
Queensland recently, when we struck Bill’s waggon
jambed in a broken culvert. Bill was cooing child-
ish prattle to the beasts, with the result that he had
soothed nearly all of them to sleep. “It’s blankv
heart-rending,” said poor Wm., mopping his classic
brow. “Tut, tut,” chirruped the assayer, “why
don’t you cuss at them?” “P’raps,” snarled Bil-
liam, “y’d like to take a hand y’self,” “Don’t mind,”
replied the cheerful stranger. And with that he
addressed a few well-chosen remarks to the slum-
bering team. Five minutes later there was
a bush fire raging in the vicinity, the stone
culvert had melted, and the team was flee-
ing down the road, with me after them on
my bike. I caught up to them an hour later, as
they tore into the railway yard. “That your lot?”
said the station-master to me. “You’re lucky. An-
other five minutes and y’d bin too late. Just got
orders to take no more goods ’count of the strike at
Sydney.” It didn’t matter, anyhow. Bill was
only carrying water, and it had evaporated.

“Phlop”: Wandered into a N. S. Wales
State school, t’other day, and remarked (a) Eleven
maps, 10 of which, had been fashioned in England.
(6) A British zoological diagram. The comparative
sizes of the animals and insects were cheerfully dis-
regarded. Thus, the alligator was represented as
being half a size bigger than the whale; the bat
was almost as high, and full twice as broad as the
man; the kangaroo ran a dead-heat, in height,
with the elephant; the frog rivalled the shark in
dimensions, and the monkey was greater than the
lion, (e) The Australian flag was nowhere in evi-
dence, though the British emblem slapped the
gale from the pine pole staff. ( d ) Ninety per

American doings, with a Chow and a Jap tearitem

BROWN’S FANTOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill Brown is quite a sober chap—considering he is
Brown,
With money in the bank, and cash to burn —
He seldom loafs about the pubs, nor talks around
the town;
Just waiting for the beer-hour, to adjourn.
But, now and then, when things in town are extra
bright and gay,
When Dave and Jim have blown in from the bush,
He’ll take his sober-harness off and spend a scarlet
day
Or two, and p'r’aps an evening, with the push.
One day a saintly lady handed Brown a little tract
Called “Mind It Doesn’t Sting You!” full of
wild,
Weird talk of fantods purple-green ; with grim word-
pictures packed,
Pale agony on hideous horror piled.
Brown read the tract—then, for the time, forgot
what Drink could do,
For, that same day, full up of Outback drouth
And good, hard cash, old Dave and Jim arrived in
town--and through
Said town the' bunch went raging, with a Mouth.
And where the warm crowd swarmed and shuffled—
where the flaring bars
Were bright—the bunch went in, and Brown went
first:
Bill Brown drank beer in quantities, his vision
blurred with stars,
His one desire to go on quenching thirst.
But, later on, when midnight came, Brown lost his
bunch of pals,
Marooned upon an unknown, beer-lapped shore,
Blurred darkness all about, crammed with strange,
moving animals ;
Men, most of these—but men to Brown no more!
Then, then the truth came home to him —this wan
the work of Drink !
And—there!-—the worst, wild animal of all
Moved slow, and moved in front of him, an all-fours
Missing Link
He stared, and all his flesh began to crawl!
The ghostly fanfaron went on ahead, with nose in
air,
And now and then would turn on Brown, and
sneer—-
Brown felt the fingers of cold fear creep through his
rising hair !
“Ish ’orrible!” he groaned, “’N’ jush on beer!”
Cnevenly "Brown strode, and cursed the Thing, in
sweating fear
Of what would happen when those fantods grim—-
The crimson snakes and such—-began, with rude joy,
to appear ;
And, as a bloke came by, Brown spoke to him.
He murmured, “’Ere, jush ’elp me shove this fantod
off the spot!
We’ll kill th’ brute!” And rocked with rage and
grog.
“I do’ know nothin’, bloke, o’ fantods,” said the
man ; “but wot
The blazes are yeh doin’ wif my dog?”

DELAY IS DANGEROUS.
There is no- class of ailment that affects the system
quicker than bowel complaints, and any delay in
treating diarrhoea or colic is dangerous. Chamber-
lain’s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy is the
only remedy that is absolutely reliable in cases of
this kind, and as some member of the family is
always liable to an attack at any time, it should
always be kept in the house. This remedy never
fails to give prompt relief.*

Eddyson” : “A-course I b’lieve ;n the
’ficaey iv prayer,” said the ancient whaler; “ain’t l
ad good reason ter? There waS' Andrews prayed
fer rain t’ water his cows, ’ml next inornin’ his
whole herd was corpsed in the flood. But me Own
case is a more strikin’ experience of what I call
the hintervention iv Providenijfe. We was camped
seven mile out iv beniliquifl, me ’hd ‘Capers’ Greeri,
’nd Soapy Simms, ’nd tte was that down to it the
lamentable finish seemed terrible near. I’d ’ad
nothin’ tb eat but a prickiy pear for two days, ’nd
we was that mistrusted we couldn’t steal nothin’ t*
save our himmortal souls. Well, we was gathered at
the rivet, with a fistful of fire a-tween us, fishin’ fef
eel with a sharpened hairpin, ’nd that hungry we’d
a cat in anythin’ that come on, halligator' or ’orse.
Suddenly Soapy put up a howl. ‘I kin blanky well
stand this no longer,’ sez he. ‘Here goes!’ ’nd he.
plunks down on his knees, ’nd begins t’ hoist a
prayer. Mind yeh, Soapy was no slouch. He’d bin a
AAesleyan elder in his day, ’nd ,could put a prayer
with any o’ the professionals. He prayed, ’nd
prayed, ’nd prayed, rastlin’ on the turf, till his
knees dug a hole you cud ’a’ buried a cow in. He
on’y let up when he was all out, ’nd then he flopped
on his nose, ’nd lay there givin’ a little flurry with
bis shins like a dyin’ fish. I was, a- bit concerned
about old Soap, ’nd moved over to fan his ’eated
brow, when boom went a great explosion somewhere
off west, and, jist one second later, whiz came
somethin out iv Heaven, took jnef ’tween wind ’nd
hi isket, nd put me unconscionable fer eight minutes.
What d’yer thing it was? ’Twas the hans-er t’
Soapy’s prayer—a boiled leg iv mutton. Soapy ’nd
Green ad got it arf ate afore I come to. Yes,
Providence ’ad hanswered Soapy’s prayer, although
He ’ad t’ blow up one iv the digesters et Oddv’s
Boilin’-down Works, two miles off/ t’ deliver the
goods.”

“Leo Lear” : There are three articles used
in bush homes that never seem to reach the owners’
idea of perfection. They are lamps, butter-coolers
and wire-strainers. As new ones appear on the
market, the old are cursed and heaved out. The
top shelf in the store of many bush homesteads is
occupied by a collection of lamps fit for a curiosity
museum. Tall and squat, smokers and oil-eaters,
whole and maimed, all discarded for new favorites
on fancy stands and nude Venus pedestals. In the
matter of butter-coolers, these * commodities are as
innumerable as unsatisfactory, and it is not safe to
walk in the back yard by moonlight for worn-out
tins, pots and canvas,, that have-given up the weary
task of trying to keep the extract of Mrs. Bull from
bolting when the mercury is khook-jhg against the
roof of its cage. I place wire-strainers a good third
in the ranks of the cursed and cast off. Any station
tool-house contains half a dozen types that some
fencer has condemned as only fit to strain milk.
TO PUT DRINK DOWN.
SPEAKER : “I am of the same opinion as Mr.
Mauger. Take, for instance, this horrible
example on the platform!"
A VOICE: “Which one?"
A TRUST FULFILLED.
ALLEGED ARTIST : “ Yes, many a tune my poor old mother implored me not to become an artist .”
STRANGER : “ Don't worry, old man. You didn’t!”
“Wild Harry":
For raising the most
i n tolerable emotions,
give me flying wattle
dust. I have labored
in a primitive bark-
grinding mill, and 1
know. At every breath
the particles are drawn
up the nostrils and
down the throat, caus-
ing to the uninitiated
unutterable discomfort.
The throat is parche'd,
and that type of thirst
induced which mature
beer anglers are wont
to picture in their
sweetest dreams. In
the better type 6 f
mill,;; where up-to-date
machinery is in opera-
tion, the foregoing
discomforts are, to a
large extent, obviated
by “collectors,” which
suck up the major
portions of the dust
before the men have
the chance to do so.
I’ll take l a long time
to forget the day the
Particular Baptist par-
son, who came to the
mill in the pursuit of
souls, was introduced
to the snuff. One o f
the hands was doing
some high and lofty
feats, of profanity,
when the Bap, feist
walked- into the dust->
room, and promptly
fastened to the offend-
er. “My dear ber-
r uthe r,” h e com-
menced.. “Oh, go to
flamin’ blazes,” howled
Profanity*, who was
very, annoyed about
something, and .drop-
ped the kerosene tin
of refined bark he was
nursing right at the shepherd’s corn-cobs. You
couldn’t see that shepherd for dust, and when he hur-
riedly passed the mill nine days later, on his way
home, he was still sneezing.

“K.T.” : If there is a nomination fee for
entrance to the snake-infested localities stakes, I
would like to see “Ivoreki” get his money back.
Unless he can make out something, better than . hisa
3800 Papuan specimens for the year, I should advise
him to take a trip to the south-east district of South
Australia, where a month would cause him to go
back to Kanosia and agitate for a close 1 season for
snakes. At Glenroy station, there, two men are
employed during the summer months doing nothing
else but murdering crawlers that approach the home-
stead in deputations. Saw some of the hands go out
one day to Clean up a waterllole. They took a heavy
cart with them, and when they returned it was full
of snakes’ heads. That’s what I call something like
decent snake country.
“ Paddymelon ” : If “ Offsider ” (D.
2/l/’ll) had said of Queensland hickory that it
was ‘tough,” rather than “hard,” I would not have
had to correct him. But if he wishes to get the
full strength of the wood, let him inquire of the
Queensland Railway Department, which was per-
suaded, in the good old days, by contractor Robb,
hickory was just as good as ironbark. Every
biidge built of hickory had to be renewed soon
the borers and weevils, particularly the
weevils, got to hear of its whereabouts, and the job
was more like renewing a flour mill than a railway
bridge. In my youthful days I lined and ceiled a
house with hickory, but the weevils started to
devour it off the landscape, so it had to come down.
I intended to use it for bone-dust, but it blew over
to Papua.
* * * *
• a hasten to tumble or somersault
into the Abo.” columns, to tackle “Brumby” and
his octopus (B. lti/li/’li). “Brum” is very much
so when he states that the feelers of the sea horror
are easily torn in two. Have seen many a fisher-
man blunt, not only his knife, but his flow of lan-
guage, trying to sever those same arms or legs, but
if “Brumby” would like to bet that his statement is
correct, I’ll provide the marine devil; for test pur-
poses, and lay five to one on him. From the way
.“Brumby” talks of turning octopuses inside out, like
‘tbbacco pouches, I take it he is acquainted only with
bantam-weights of about Boz. First time he meets
one in the Jack Johnson division, he’ll mavbe get
some new ideas about the most loathsome thing that
flies with many legs in the sea.
“Sr” : I’ve had the Question put to me in
all sorts of ways, but the man with the Face-at-the-
Window countenance was an easy winner. “Sir,”
he said politely, “do you happen to know of a long
beer in want of a good home?”
“Nulla”: Penrith (N,S.W.) has a Jersey
cow which owns a fine calf and an output of two
gallons of milk a day, and, withal, is but 34in. high.
“N. or M.” : Re the voice of the mope-
hawk. Robert Hall, Curator of the Hobart Museum,
who has written a text-book on Australian birds, and
is supposed to be an authority on the subject, agrees
with “Vagabond’s” mate (B. , 16/11/T1), in credit-
ing the boobook owl with the pork howl. The
morepork does not sing in public, contenting itself,
under observation, with giving a lifelike impersona-
tion of a broken branch or a piece of loose bark.
Nevertheless, where the morepork is, there is the
outcry for a further supply of pig—and, where the
morepork isn’t, as far as my experience goes, hogs-
flesh is off.
“Palaver”: Re ancient country pubs. The
Junction Hotel, at the junction of the Merri Merri
and Marthaguy creeks, deserves a line. First built
as a stockman’s bungalow, it was known as the
Shingle Hut, and under this name attained notoriety
from Bathurst to the Barcoo. Midnight and his
merry men made it a favorite rendezvous. It was
opened in the late ’6o’s by a German named Eckert,
better known as “Old Goodluck.” A little habit of
his, when bushmen were in . numbers at his shanty,
was to fill up a row of glasses every five minutes,
and, pointing to one of the coves assembled, remark:
“Those are yours; drink up, boys; good luck.”
Hence his title. Old Goodluck is dead these 40
years, and his old pub, after having helped to mitigate
the effects of many a drought, has just been banged
up. The weary traveller from Quambone to Carinda
now arrives with all Sahara in his mouth, due to a
dry stretch of 40 miles.
“Lex” : Attorney-Gen. busy
missing the biggest change ever offered a
law-reformer in N. S. Wales. The Ma
State’s legal procedure and law machinery
generally is years out of date ; it is clumsy,
costly, and favors the rich against all
others. Instead of the courts being, as
courts are intended to be, a refuge for those
who think they still suffer an injustice,
people avoid them as if they were pestilential,
and only go there when dragged by some
daring litigant who has the spirit of the
gambler in him, or has heaps of money to
throw away on a costly form of amusement.
The old system of common-law pleading is
still preserved, and the - complicated and
costly English system of procedure has been
permitted to run to seed. The arrangement
of the court sittings is absurd and archaic,
and every circumstance which would render
the process of law costly and tedious is
maintained with stubborn perversity. Prac-
tically nothing has been done to put into
force, for the benefit of the litigant, the
powers given by B. R. Wise's Supreme
Court Act of several years ago. The Judges
are overworked, and the benches are under-
manned, and the delays are scandalous; the
old stupid rules of evidence are maintained,
with all sorts of petty points which may
cause appeals and perhaps new trials; and,
in short, that which popular prejudice attri-
butes to courts, Judges and lawyers is attri-
butable to the N.S.W. system more than any
other now existing in any place where Eng-
lish is spoken. Holman, by a stroke of the
pen, could create a commission of three
strong men, with some amount of common
sense, and every desire to simplify the pro-
cedure of the courts, and a firm determina-
tion to knock out absurdities, however vener-
able they may be. The present English
system is a good model, though there might
be many improvements. The aim ought to
be —in accordance with modern tendencies —
to make all trials in the courts as much like
conciliation and arbitration proceedings as
possible, rather than forensic duels in which
the result may often depend more on the
skill of the advocate than pn the merits of
the dispute. To strengthen- Holman's ner-
vous hands, the Labor Conference affirmed
the principle of law reform up to the hilt;
but the one man who lias the -power to carry
that recommendation into* - effect, during
what may be a short interval of office, is, as
usual, making his party’s enemies a present
of his opportunities. , ; .
♦ " '
“Redcot” : As this deponent views it. no-
thing will be. done to obliterate the .Closed
Ports curse till the districts concerned start
a vigorous agitation in the matter. It is
natural that Melbourne and Sydney should,
in their short-sighted fashion, discourage
outside competition. London did the same
for as long as it could. In the 15th century,
“London commercial men.... passed in com-
mon council a law which prohibited any of
the citizens from carrying their goods to any
fair or market out of London” (vide “Lon-
don in Olden Times”). Parliament can-
celled the edict, but the Port-starvers of the
day only launched out, unabashed, on fresh
schemes to keep all the trade of the nation
in their own grip. Liverpool, Hull, etc., only
came into their own by unwearying effort.
And so it is going to be with the vast, deep-
water harbors that are languishing in an
unused state in Australia. If those concerned
really want a port, and can make up their
minds as to the sort of port they want,
then they will eventually get it, provided
they fight hard enough. At the present rate
of proceeding, they won’t. The question
needn’t develop into a party cry, and even if
mischievous ingenuity twists it so, the plank
is a good one for any political party. The
great point is that the country-folk should
get busy quickly, and be prepared to make a
long-distance event of it. If they wait for
the city-bossed State Governments to “do
something,” then the name of their territory
will probably remain Mud.

To hold him, and with movements fleet
He sought an isle where law was not.

There one might live in laziness.
With impudence and manly grace
He mashed to amorous excess
The plump and pleasing ehieftainess.

ITEMS
Retired Last week, after 21 years’ quiet,
solid service, Christopher Brandis, member
uf the N.S.W. Land Appeal Court —the tri-
bunal established in 1889 to blaze a track
through the jungle of the Ma State’s land
laws. Frank Rogers, Q.C., was appointed
president; Stephen Freeman, Under-Secre-
tary for Lands, represented the red-tape
aspects of the case; and Brandis, who had
been pastoral inspector for the A.J.S. Bank,
brought in the practical land-settling ex-
perience. Rogers quarrelled with his job
because he wanted the status of a Supreme
Court Judge; Freeman retired long since;
and Brandis saw not only them, but half a
dozen of their successors off the appallingly
dreary premises.

Yes, we've noticed it.
Lavington Bonython, Adelaide’s new
Mayor, is one of the band of younger men
who butted in to the City Council a few
years back, and changed the character of
that body. Of these, John Baker and Alfred
Roberts ("noted tennis players both) have
dropped out, but Frank Moulder and Alan
bimpson have not tired of the game, and
Bonython, with 10 years’ experience behind
him, is still under 40, and the youngest
mayor Adelaide has ever had. He is the
eldest son of Langdon Bonython (of the
Advertised, and an original Federal
M.H.R.), and has been connected with the
commercial side of that office ever since he
left school. His wife, a daughter of long-
a<ro Premier John Bray, died several years
ago, and his sister, wife of Herbert Parsons
(Federalist Paddy Glynn’s law-partner),
acts as Mayoress.

Adelaide Register last week farewelled
Clarence Moody, its chief of staff, who is leav-
ing to start a sporting weekly that is to
knock out all local efforts in that line. D. J.
Gordon, his predecessor, gave up presswork
for Federal politics, and, with the death of
Robert Kyffin Thomas and the retirement of
C. J. Stevens, promotion in the Register
ranks has been of a record briskness the last

the chair of Moody, who, being an expert in

paper by going the round of the present test-

R. R. P. Hickson, President of Sydney
Harbor Trust, is due Tor retirement, and Joe
Davis looks like the most determined starter
for the job. Every public servant has
heard of “Holy Joe” Davis, sometime Under-
secretary for Works, and now Inspecting
Engineer for N.S.W. in London. He is a
Heaven-born engineer, particularly skilled in
the subterranean branch of his trade. His
friend Lonsdale, M.L.A., also a holy man,
has already addressed the N.S.W. Assembly
on Joe’s virtues; for things can’t be taken
for granted since there are others crowding
after Hickson’s shoes, while they are still
on the old man’s feet.
The Old Soldier discourseth :
London rumor hath it that the Marquis of Stafford,
heir to the dukedom of Sutherland, is to marry one
of the daughters of the late Maharajah of Cooch
Behar. The India Office is said to be violently op-
posed to the match. Cooch Behar was about the
best known of the Indian potentates in the sporting
and social world of London. llis father, before the
Bhutan war of 1864, owned the largest stock of
elephants in India, but so many were killed during
the war, that, for several years after, it was difficult
in Cooch Behar to raise enough of the great beasts for
a state procession. However, the compensation the
Indian Government paid for them swelled the Rajah’s
bank balance, and enabled his son to break his caste
and put in about three-fourths of his time in Europe.
Cooch Behar’s sons have all been educated at English
public schools and universities, and the daughters are
I kewise English trained. In appearance the family
is comely to a degree, and little darker than Italian's
or Spaniards. The tar-brush has never held any
particular terrors for the youthful European who
hasn’t been outside Europe much. The German Grown
Prince, for example, became wildly infatuated, during
his recent tour of India, with a pretty princess, the
product of a Paris convent; and his staff spent many
agon'sing days and nights hunting the royal lover
away from the. lady’s side. The infusion of a dose of
Indian blood into the British peerage would be an
entirely novel circumstance. Picture a half-caste
duke! One compensation for this horror would be,
in the case of any of the three maidens of the Cooch
Behar family, a huge dot. Their father’s passion
for polo, t ; ger shooting, musical comedy stars -and
suchlike expensive luxuries in no wise preyed on his
vast monetary resources.

“Stripe” talks about Victorian policemen:
Melbourne’s senior police officer is ex-Superinten-
dent Pewtress. He came with a batch of policemen
from London, the chief men being Pewtress and
Sergeant Archibald, afterwards of Warrnambool.
Pewtress was for many years in charge of the Mel-
bourne City Court. Then came a crisis. Chief
Commissioner Standish and Superintendent Winch
fulminated a scheme for the education of gentlemen
cadets as officers. Premier Berry capsized this by
the promotion of rankers. The men thus advanced
included Larner of Ballarat, Drought of Bendigo,
Toohey of Geelong, Pewtress, Montfort and Babing-
ton. Thus the path was opened for T. O’Callaghan,
a working detective, to advance to his present billet
of Chief Commissioner, in succession to such upper
crusters as Chomlcy, Nicholson and Standish. The
last named did all he could to upset the new arrange-
ment. Pewtress, who had seldom been on horseback,
was sent to the Benalla district, and given charge of
a great area of wilderness and mountain. The most
splendid horseman of all, Toohey, Berry’s special
favorite, was placed in charge of the Melbourne City
Court, under a delusion that he would there display
his literary ignorance. Pewtress, at Benalla, had the
ill-luck to drop upon the outbreak of the Ned Kelly
gang. Yet he held his own as an experienced and
judic'ous officer, till Hare and Nicholson took charge,
in their small way.
Dan O'Connor has brought portion of his
whiskers and other valuable properties back
to Australia. He shed the herbage while
in America, where such gauds are treated
with ribald jeers, and it never quite regained
its old lush abundance. Dan is thinner, and
a shade shakier than of yore. He stayed
in Melbourne for a few days, but, as he
might put it himself, Sydney was his ulti-
mate and glahrious objictive.
THE SURFERS' TOPHET.
The most prominent degree-takers at the
Adelaide University Commem., this year, were
Donald Campbell, M.L.A., who, like the late
George Ash, and Attorney-General Denny,
got into Parliament first, and took a law
course afterwards; cricketer Dolling, just
back from the inter-State tour, and now a
full-fledged medico; Miss Eger ton-Jones, who
is to be Adelaide’s first woman lawyer, and
meanwhile is a 8.A.; and Harold Giles, or-
phan, farm-hand, telegraph messenger and
ship’s cabin-boy, and now winner of the
Tinline prize for local history research, and
the Roby Fletcher prize for p- ~etiology and
logic.
The old Maori guide, Sophia, who was as
much a part of the boiling district of Roto-
rua as the geysers, moved on to Rangi re-
cently, after giving life a trial for more than
80 years. It was she who saw the phan-
tom canoe which very thoughtfully gave
warning of the Tarawera horror in 1886,
but, unfortunately, nobody took the vessel’s
word for it, and it carried no references
from its former customers, so Sophia just
stayed on at Wairoa until the mountain
bust its boiler, when she made a name for
herself by saving a considerable amount of
people from a large supply of boiler. In
later years she acted as the custodian of the
old carved house at Whakarewarewa, and
it’s a good job for George Rex that the
severe lady who runs the royal roost wasn’t
present when Sophia described all about it
to the Duke of York.
Sam Tait, of the Collingwood (Vic.)
Observer, is dead. When a young man he
went to America, and wrought as a comp,
on the New York Herald; but the gold-
fields drew him to Melbourne. He dug with
some success, at Castlemaine and the Ovens,
and then joined the Melbourne Herald, a
morning paper in those days. Tait had an
instinct that Melbourne ought to have an
evening sheet, so he started the Evening
News, but his financial resources were in-
sufficient. He started also the Weekly
Dispatch, but the infant was slain by an
anagram, “To Agnes.” In 1864 Tait helped
to buy the Collingwood Observer from Gra-
ham Berry, and soon became sole proprie-
tor, as well as editor. He held on to that
till it evaporated, not long ago. As a writer
he had a pawky humor, though he hardly
ever smiled.
One of the most striking figures at the
send-off to Douglas Mawson °in Adelaide
w/is Pat Auld, who crossed the continent
with McDouall Stuart just half a century
ffSO. The jubilee of the sighting of the In-
chan Ocean is to be celebrated next year,
It was a sort of historical event when they
“shook”—the veteran who dared the torrid
sun of the north and the youngster who is
just off to tackle the ice of the south.
According to London
papers “Smiler” Hales has
been appointed South Amer-
ican correspondent of Lon-
don Times, with head-
quarters in Buenos Aires.
In his 50 years “Smiler"
has been many things. He
was born in Adelaide, and
was a carpenter until he
got a prize for some Liter-
ary Society jingle. That
sent him into journalism
equipped with a very poor
education, a vivid imagina-
tion and a magnificent
capacity for pushing into
the middle of every trouble
that was going. When
Bedford was Randolph the
Reckless, junior on one
Broken Hill paper, Hales
was the reckless mining re-
porter on another, and when
he wasn’t disguising him-
self and pushing into a mine
from which he had been
barred he was fighting some
“silvertail" who had hinted
that he wasn’t as game as
he said he was. Since then
he has been through the
Boer and Russo-Jap un-
pleasantries, and after chas-
ing “local color” for pot-
boiling yarns through most
countries, turned to
S’America 18 months ago
with his two boys, allegedly
to chase mining proposi-
tions. He hasn’t the balance
of Dr. Morrison, the Aus-
tralian who has done great
work for the Times in
Asia; but he can get anywhere, and paint
vivid purple patches under any circum-
stances.
The story of the birth of a shipping co.:
The Huddart-Parlcer shipping and coal business is
being passed on to a public co. at last. Captain
Huddart was in the trade first; he started to haul
coal from Newcastle to Victoria some time in the
middle ’4o’s. T. J. Parker dropped down in Geelong
in ’53 ; he kent a store, and got into the shipping
business through acting as agent for Captain William
Howard Smith, the founder of the Howard Smith
Co. A little later Howard Smith sold out his half-
share in the Express to Parker ; and John Traill be-
came managing agent at Geelong, while Parker went
up to look after things in Melbourne. S. B. Skinner
was the Express’s engineer; he and the skipper,
Howard Smith, had been equal partners. When
Skinner died in 1867, Traill and Cantain Thomas
Webb (the new skipper) bought his half-share.
Howard Smith is dead; so is the original Parker:
but .John Traill is still on the Huddart-Parker Board,
along with two of the second generation of Webbs.
Captain Huddart brought out his nephew, James,
and it was this Huddart who joined the Parker-
Traill-Webb firm in 1876, and thus formed Huddart,
Parker and Co., which promptly jumped into the
inter-State trade, and kept on jumping until the
vendor co. now takes £750,000 in shares for its in-
terest in the business, and alleges, on the best
authority, that its hard, solid assets, are worth that
much or more. When Howard Smith sold out of the
Express he bought the You Yangs, and that was the
very first of the regular inter-Staters.

i’here are no fireworks about this concern. When
things are prosperous it doesn’t blaze out into 20 p.c.
divs. ; it just pays its solid 8 p.c. on ordinary shares
(the lately-issued pref. shares carry only 5 p.c.), and
tucks away the balance as a stand-by for the droughty
day. Even in the ’9o’s it went on paying 8 p.c., and
it didn’t ask anybody to take less than 20s. in the
£•_ No doubt it was remarkably well situated; for
while others had to argue with short-term or call
depositors, who wanted their money back at once, the
great bulk of this co.’s borrowed money was repre-
sented by irredeemable debentures ; wherefore the co.
wasn’t under any obligation to rush round and realise
its assets at any price. It just sat down and nursed
those assets, and waited for values to recover; and,
as nearly all the assets were country lands, in 19
eases out of 20 they recovered all right. It is
highly probable, also, that some surplus profit was used
to write down properties that looked over-valued ;
and it may be that some of the extra-big profit
shown during the past two or three years represents
the surplus derived from the sale of those written-
down assets. If that is so, such profits are non-re-
curring, and the total will ease off when the written-
down properties have been got rid of.
Still, apart from these' sales, everything has fa-
vored extra-big profits in the pastoral and pastoral
agency business. The squatter certainly doesn’t travel
much on the old lines. Many a manager would
have been sacked if he had saved his grass 25 years
ago as he saves it to-day. Nevertheless, in spite
of this new caution, the tendency is to run a few
more sheep every succeeding year, and risk the loss
of a few more hundreds, or thousands, or tens of
thousands, when the drought comes. As long as the
country will carry the stock there is enormous profit
in this business; it is a good deal like piling up
deck cargo on an already well-loaded ship. If it
has luck and gets through, well and good ; if not—
well, so much the bigger loss. So far the
luck has been good; seasons and prices have
both been right. And, apart from the pas-
toral business, Dalgety’s run all sorts of buying
and selling agencies, and nobody fattens faster than
the agent when there’s money to burn and prices
don’t matter much. All of which points one way:
allowing that Dalgety’s business organisation is good
enough for any Board to be proud of, the difference
between the co.’s profits in good times and in bad
ones is still likely to be very considerable indeed.
As indicated above, the co., in 1908, issued
£500,000 of 5 p.c. pref. capital, represented by
£lO shares fully paid. The ordinary capital is in
200,000 shares of £2O, paid to £5, and carrying,
therefore, a liability of £ls—-quite enough to make
the shareholder take a very keen interest in the
growth of the reserves, which are the things that
stand between him and calls. But he is protected
now, as he was in the ’9o’s, by the fact that a great
deal of the outside money in the business is just as
much a fixture as his own. There are big debts of
other kinds, certainly ; but nearly two-thirds of them
are represented by liquid assets. This shows things
in more detail:—

The past six years’ disclosed profits aggregate
£966,359, of which £496,042, or very little more
than half, has been divided; the rest has gone to
formal reserves, or to write down the premises ac-
count. Meantime, large sums, not shown above as
profits, have been paid to the staff benevolent fund,
which now amounts to £31,000. The rapid strength-
ening of the reserves not only improves the security
of the debenture holders and pref. shareholders, but
also makes it an easier matter to keep the ordinary
dividend steady. For the ordinary shareholder has
only the third bite: good seasons or bad, the deben-
ture holders call for their £120,000 or so of interest,
and then the prefs. back in for a fixed £25,000.
This large mass of debenture money is bound to make
Dalgety’s profits appear erratic: for if this money
earns only 1 p.c. less this year than it did last,
down drop the profits £14,000. Or, if it earns
i p.c. more, there is £14,000 more for the ordin-
aries to pouch, if they feel that way. Still, they
can’t pouch it for nothing. The price they pay is
that they practically guarantee everybody else against
any loss of capital; and with £5,868,179 in ad-
vances, properties, etc. (apart from premises), there
is a good deal of scope for loss, should anything bad
happen to Australia.

The revenue for the half-year kept just about where
it had been lately, but expenses crept up a little in
almost all directions, and pushed profits down. The
next table shows how various items have moved: —

The biggest movement follows upon the withdrawal
of the power hitherto held by private banks to issue
notes. Those notes were really a deposit without
interest; the bank issued a £ 1 note as a receipt for
a sovereign, and didn’t pay any interest on the
sovereign. All it cost was for the printing of the
receipt or note, and a tax or composition of 2 p.c.
payable to the State on the average amount of notes
in circulation. Anything the banks could make out
of this loan in excess of about 24 or 2| p.c. was
profit, and it probably averaged a shade over 1 p.c.
p.a. on the total amount of the notes outstanding.
This profit has now disappeared. The little National
of Tasmania, though it has got £44,854 more of regu-
lar depos ts, has really less resources than it had
12 months ago, having £49,365 less of its notes in
circulation ; consequently, in spite of the increase in
deposits, it has deemed it prudent to reduce its ad-
vances.
Other things being equal, that bank is strongest
from the depositors’ point of view, which has the
largest amount of share capital and reserves in pro-
portion to deposits and other borrowed money. This
bank has £211,918 of its own money in the busi-
ness, and £607,357 of other people’s; so it has only
£2 17s. 4d. of other people’s for every £1 of its
own —an unusually small and safe proportion. On
the other hand, having only 27 p.c. of its liabilities in
liquid form, it is evidently trading to the utmost of
its present capacity, and is in a poor position to
meet a sudden demand without outside help. How-
ever, it is understood that neither of the Tasmanian
banks rake up money from outside; and it is the
foreign deposit that invariably causes the trouble.
Having the use of so comparatively little of the
public’s money, the profits are naturally rather small:
calculated on capital and reserves combined they
show up like this: —
May, 1907.. £9 13 5 p.c. Nov., 1909.. £7 12 2 p.c'
N0v.,1907.. 819 3 ~ Ma\,1910.. 719 11 „
Mav, 1908.. 9 2 0 „ N0v.,1910.. 716 10
Nov., 1908.. 813 3 „ May, 1911.. 716 4 „
May, 1909.. 8 7 3 ~ Nov., 1911.. 615 2 „
The figures are not moving the right way; but you
could hardly expect anything else in view of the
depression in the Tasmanian mining business apart
from tin, and the general dry-rot which afflicts the
Sleepy Island.

Until the last two or three months most Australasian
fire and marine offices have lately had a rattling
good time; but this little office’s experience hasn’t
been anything very extra. In so small a concern
one year’s results, taken by themselves, are, however,
no criterion, because the law of averages hasn’t got
room to swing right round in the time ; one or two
extra losses make all the difference between a good
year and a bad one. Taking a general view of the
situation, one thing sticks out conspicuously: the co.
has been dividing too big a proportion of its profits.
In 10 years it has added only £21,783 to its re-
serves, while its dividends (with tax) have amounted
to £63,077. There probably was a time when
people didn’t inquire far into such things ; but now-
adays, when practically all the offices work accord-
ing to tariff, and you can’t get cheaper insurance
from one office than from another, the ordinary busi-
ness person naturally looks for other things to re-
commend one office over another ; and from his point
of view that office is best which leaves the largest
proportion of its profits in the till for the protection
of policy-holders. The natural result is that, almost
without exception, the offices which are making the
most progress are those which divide the least of
their profits. Unfortunately this co. is among those
which divide the biggest proportion; hence it has a
record like this: —•

Things are improving a little, certainly; but even
now the premium income is actually less than it
was in 1900. Yet, if the shareholders weren’t so
greedy, the co. would be in a really strong position
to appeal for business. The capital and reserves
combined total £132,241, and (assuming the assets
are good) that amount would afford very good pro-
tection to insurers, even if there were twice as many
of them. Very few offices, indeed, have funds equal
to twice the amount of the year’s total premiums ;
but this office has just upon six times that amount.
The co.’s strength is, therefore, unimpeachable—as-
suming that the assets are even moderately good.
They certainly are not what this paper regards as
an ideal lot for a fire insurance co. No less than
£93,330 of a total of £138,592 are mortgages, and
mortgages are not the sort of assets a fire co. can
realise promptly in large lumps without loss—and
that is the sort of assets a fire office is liable to want.
Nevertheless, after making very large allowances on
this account, the Derwent and Tamar carries a
smaller load of risks, in proportion to its funds, than
almost any other office that this paper has met.

And still some people sav there is no land-boom in
Sydney! The one serious question that faces share-
holders in this co. is: Is the profit a real thing, or is
it merely a paper profit? The co.’s business is to
buy property wholesale and sell it retail, mostly on
time-payment. Occasionally also, no doubt, it makes
advances to people who want to build. As prices
have been steadily going up, in consequence of the
unbroken prosnerity of the country and the accumu-
lation of capital, there has been a very big profit in
the subdivision business; it hasn’t been anything un-
usual r or a small suburban paddock, that cost £5OOO
five or six years ago, to be split up and sold on time
for £15,000. The Federal land tax has helped
the subdividers, inasmuch as the tax depreciated
the value of the paddock when it was held in a lump,
but doesn’t touch it when it is cut up into building
blocks and sold to different people. But though the
subdivided block may be sold for £15,000, it doesn’t
follow that the £lO,OOO (less expenses) will be
profit. All depends upon whether the buyers can come
up to the scratch with their instalments. If they can’t,
the allotments will be thrown back on to the sub-
dividers’ hands, and by that time stray allotments
may be as hard to get rid of as a poor but thirsty
relation. If it wanted to do so, a co. of this sort
could plainly boom itseif by the simple process of
reckoning the whole £lO,OOO (less expenses) as
immediate profit; on the other hand, if it wanted to
play the safe game, it would put a large portion of
that £lO,OOO to suspense, and only credit itself with
the last of the amount when the final instalment was
paid. This co. has been long enough in the business
to know the risks; and that no doubt explains why
it has a suspense account, though nobody can tell
whether it is big enough to meet all contingencies.
The time almost inevitably will come when, the
property market being stagnant, the co.’s profits will
shrink, through the absence of any new transactions
worth mentioning; but if the management is pru-
dent, it will still go on showing substantial profits
as the old transactions are completed, and the profits
in suspense are drawn upon.
One thing in this co.’s favor is that it hasn’t got
a very great deal of other people’s money at risk,
and another is that it isn’t hanging on to much free-
hold or leasehold property—it evidently only buys to
sell quickly. This shows the course of things

Last year a bonus equal to 12J p.c. was paid, and
the amount was distributed in new shares; in this

For years past The Bulletin has been asking the
management to convert the published accounts from
a farce into something a little more serious; and a
trifle has now been done in that way. The balance-
sheet still shows, however —“ Cost of sundry estates
and improvements, £105,270,” and if that is cor-
rect —which it probably isn’t—it means that only
the properties which have lately been got rid of
have been written down. This seems hardly possible;
it seems more likely that a bit of general writing
down has been done. The position, in any case, re-
mains unsatisfactory. What was called for was a
complete revaluation of assets, -so that the outsider
may know as much as the insider. The uncertainty
has always bothered 'the investor, with the result
that, to-day, the £2 share is saleable at only about
275. 6d., in spite of the 6 p.c. ..-dividend. This is a
pretty shocking reflection upon’ either the assets or
the management. Evidently, either the investor
doesn’t believe that the assets are worth anything
like the figures mentioned in the accounts, or he
doesn’t think that the management can make profit-
able use of them; and that isn’t a. position in which
a self-respecting management ought to allow itself to
stay.
The principal balance-sheet figures are grouped
hereunder: —

The co. is in the suburban land purchase and sub-
division business or gamble, but hasn’t been able to
do as much as it might, through being lumbered up
with country property.—particularly the Furracabad
estate, near Glen Innes —which it bought a good
many years ago 'at what still looks too high a price.
There is no telling where country farming lands will
go; it is admittedly almost impossible to value them
on a scientific basis. Not so long ago big mortgage
concerns refused to consider a valuation of wheat lands
at over £5 an acre; but it isn’t much use insisting
on that, in view of the fact that many a man has
paid off that much purchase money and more in
a couple of recent seasons. Possibly, therefore, the
Haymarket may get its price yet; the utterly un-
satisfactory part of the business is that there is no
telling from the accounts how far the book valuation
is above what the properties would fetch to-day.
Besides the properties—loaded nowadays with a land
tax—the co. has £96,126 out in advances, which
means unpaid balances on properties sold on terms.
On the other side the co. owes £123,371, so that more
than half its assets are represented by borrowed
money, on which it is paying interest, no matter
whether those assets earn much or little. Altogether,
considering the buoyancy of the property market, the
co. has made poor progress in the way of getting
rid of its load; and that hints at over-valuation. It
may, nevertheless, come out all right; almost every-
thing depends on the seasons. Meantime, the direc-
tors ought to set to work and clean up the accounts,
so that shareholders may know exactly where they
are. Thomas Henley, M.P., is one of the directors,
and Thomas Henley has a compassionate regard for
the poor widow. Well, suppose the poor widow is
left a few of these shares, won t. Thomas Henley help
to stop her from sacrificing the. for 275. 6d., when,
if there were a revaluation ; " assets, it might be
shown that they are really wi h 35s. —or even the
475. 6d. which they ought to be worth if the reserves
are genuine?

In 1895 this co. had reserves of £23,921, after
paying its dividend. In 16 years it has therefore
added less than £4000; and, as £3802 has dropped
in during the past two years, it is pretty clear that
the reserves weren’t in danger of being arrested for
furious progress during the other 14 years. The
truth, of course, is. that there are reserves and re-
serves reserves which consist of froth and reserves
which consist of beer. When this co. found out that
its reserves were froth, it had two courses open: it
coma have blown off the froth, and admitted at once
that the pot was only half or quarter full, or it
could keep silent about the froth, and gradually fill
up the pot as profits were made. It took the latter
track. For years it disclosed only just enough profit
to pay the dividend; the balance was tipped silentlv
mto the pot. The co., in 1895, had £43,186 in
mortgages and other securities.” Some of these
properties had to be taken over, and the co. found
that it had advanced on them much more than they
would fetch, and that’s where the undisclosed profit
went T to make good that deficit. The co. still has
£14,819 represented by mortgages and foreclosures;
but evidently it reckons that the assets have been
written down to bedrock; hence, no doubt, some of
the big spring in disclosed profits shown during the
past two years. The reserve fund nowadays is in-
vested in office premises, acquired about six years
j they cost 41,600, and carry a mortgage of
£13,000. Apart from that, the co. has only a few
small trade debts. IVhat progress it is makin <r so
far as turnover is concerned isn’t visible, this being
one of the few trustee cos. which give us no more
information than the law prescribes; and the law
doesn’t prescribe much. Its paid capital is £30,000,
in 75,000 shares of £2, paid to Bs.

Nearly everything depends on the stock-taking in a
concern of this kind. The capital is £12,911 (it
used to be more, but had to be written down on ac-
count of some blistering defalcations) ; and the
whole of that amount and £9030 besides is repre-
sented by pledges and stock. The pledges are valued
at the amount advanced on them, plus interest, and
the stock is taken in partly at cost and partly at
valuation. Obviously, if another Aaron came along
and valued the pledges, etc., at £5OO less, that
amount would have to come either out of reserves or
out of current profits. Whether the valuation adopted
is safe or not, this paper hasn’t the ghost of an
idea; and probably the directors haven’t much of an
idea either. Besides its own funds the co. has the use of
£9658 of other people’s (deposits, overdraft, etc.) ;
and its assets, in addition to pledges and stock, con-
sist of furniture, sundry loans, property and other
trifles, valued in all at £6638. Apparently a small
part of this—probably about £7oo—is the goodwill
of a couple of small suburban three-ball shops that
were purchased a while ago. This is a paper asset
which ought to be got rid of with as much speed as
if it were a dead swine on the premises.
Huddakt, Parker, Ltd. —Alone among the
big Australasian shipping cos., Huddart, Parker and
Co. have remained a proprietary concern until now,
when they put themselves into a public co., take
£750,000 in shares, and invite a willing public to
put up another £250,000. The capital is £1,000,000,
with power to issue another £500,000. Toe present
issue consists of 500,000 6 p.c. cumulative pref. £1
shares and 500,000 ordinaries. The vendor eo. takes
375,000 of each denomination. That means
£750,000 for the business; and the prospectus sets
out that the assets exceed the liabilities by
#751,404. The vendor co. thus charges nothing for
goodwill. Nevertheless, some portion of the assets
—though a comparatively small one —may consist of
paper value, inasmuch as “Investments, etc.,” stand
for £273,866 among the assets, and there is no
guarantee that the full market value of shares held
in other cos. is represented by tangible assets.
“Steamships, lighters and hulks, properties, plant,
stocks and stores, etc.,” are in at £680,654. The
basis adopted in valuing the vessels and leaseholds
is not disclosed. Troup, Harwood and Co., however,
certify that “for five years ending June 30, 1911,
after providing for depreciation at the rate of 6 p.c.
p.a. on an amount given as being the original cost of
the vessels, and excluding any charge on shareholders’
deposits, the average annual profits amounted to
£71,714.” Shareholders’ deposits amount to
£201,642 ; assuming that that was the average total
on deposit, 4 p.c. interest would absorb £8065, leaving
£63,649 for dividend, or practically 8i p.c. on the
£750,000 at which the vendor co. values the busi-
ness. Assume that the new capital will earn 6 p.c.
net = £15,000 p.a. The total profit would then be
£63,649 + £15,000 = £78,649. The 6 p.c. pref.
div. will absorb £30,000, leaving £48,649 =£9 13s.
p.c. on the ordinary share capital. That looks all
right. And, having reached that conclusion, the only
things that seem worth further consideration are: (1)
How is the prospectus value of the vessels and other
wasting assets arrived at? (2) Are the past five
years’ profits a fair criterion?

Itecent Sydney flotations include Joe Gar-
diner, Ltd.—a eo. in 35,000 £1 shares, with another
25,000 in reserve, to purchase various boot-shop busi-
nesses, carried on in the names of Joe Gardiner, C. H.
Gardiner, David Dudley and Theo King. Starkey and
Starkey report that “the average net profit for the
three years ended July 31, 1911, after charging £5OO
a year for managing director’s salary, gave a return
of 19.7 p.c. p.a. on the average capital employed in
the business.” The vendor has, however, apparently
been trading considerably beyond his capital, and the
20,500 shares now issued to the public are (except
as to £2000) to be placed to the credit of the co.,
evidently to be used to reduce or wipe out liabilities
and enable the co. to get the benefit of substantial
trade discounts. The vendor is paid by 14,500 shares
and £2OOO cash, plus bank and cash balances on
July 31. The co. gets the benefit of the trading
since that date. The business appears to be exceed'
ingb’ profitable, though the disclosures made in the
prospectus are very meagre.

W. 11. Thomas has been the most-talked-
of man on the Stock Exchanges this past week.
British Broken Hill shares, which were a few
shillings a few months ago, soared up to
pounds on the discovery of what was alleged to be
“practically a new mine.” A couple of months ago
Thomas wrote to The Bulletin, declaring that in
the first place the find wasn’t new, and in the second
place it was dreadfully exaggerated, and as the
matter was of tremendous importance to thousands
of people, he urged that some independent expert -
(say) Hebbard, of the Sulphide Corporation, or Weir
of the North —should be called in. Thomas’s re-
marks, printed as those of one of the oldest
mining men of the field, didn’t have effect, so he
came out with a categorical statement over his own
name; and, inasmuch as he had been the co.’s sur-
veyor when the boring was done, the management
simply had to come up to the scratch. Thomas is
not now, of course, in the co.’s service; he puts it
plainly that he left because he was asked to do things
which he didn’t think were honest. Whether thev
were or not depends mainly upon whether Thomas
knows more than the people he was working with. If he

“Will the undertaking pay?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleichert
and Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeways work-
ii g in Australia, or in course of erection, and will
soon have at work, near Sydney, one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants in existence. Special

Professor Richards, in the revised edition of his
celebrated edition of “Ore Dressing,” 1909, devotes
14 pages to the Wilfiey concentrating table, and,
among other things remarks (p. 1465): “The first
table sold was installed in the Puzzle Mill, at Breck-
enridge, Colorado. Since then over 12,000 . have been
sold. This machine has revolutionised ore-dressing,
and as such is a phenomenal success. The original
form, and forerunner of all modern shaking tables
with longitudinal riffles . . has been greatly improv-
ed.” And further on (p. 1478) remarks: “One feature
of the Wilfiey table to which especial attention should
he called is its ability to separate sands from slimes
while making the ordinary concentration. This sep-
aration is more complete and thorough than can be
made by any classifier, and should be taken advant-
age of in designing mills.” In the extensive addi-
tions just made to the Golden Horseshoe Mine (W.A.)
i large number of Wilfiey Concentrators have been
installed. The Austral Otis Engineering Company,
Limited, South Melbourne, have the sole manufac-
turing rights.* [1

doesn’t know a lot he has missed his opportunities.
For Thomas was an old hand on the Barrier when
Broken Hill was found, and was the Prop.’s first sur-
veyor. What he says doesn’t, nevertheless, settle the
matter; and what any other man may say won t
definitely decide the value of this western ore body
either. The directors have called in George Klug,
manager for 8., M. and Co. in the eastern States;
but there is really too little known about the ore
body, apart from the drill-core assays, to allow any-
body to be cock-sure about its value. In the adjoin-
ing Block 14, the same vein is notoriously too poor
to pay.
* * * *
Thomas made a very poor show at the
British meeting in Adelaide. Everybody who knew
him knew that he would. Manager Woodhead has a
cheery manner that takes a crowd; Thomas talks
badly in little snarls. And he made his attack
personal, too, so that the meeting said at once:
“Ah, that’s the milk in the cocoanut!” The market
recovered at once. But yet the wise man will stay
his hand. This is only a business for the profes-
sional gambler.
For all that, the British meeting did not get down to
bedrock. The real point is: Why should plans and
assays be available in London, and not in Australia?
Why should the London Board hall-mark a big brok-
ing firm there by letting it put out a pamphlet
with the bore results and assays, if shareholders on
this side are not equally well treated? If Austra-
lians hold the shares, why don’t they move the
office? Board fees would be saved and different treat-
ment assured.
Sulphide Corporation’s net profit for the
year was £174,019; total for the past two years,
£377,852. There are 1,100,000 shares, half pre-
ference, half ordinary. The co. for years looked as
though it must go through the melting pot; but the
zinc-extraction business, combined with the pertinac-
ity of the management, saved it. The co., by the way,
has its head office in London; so, though the mine is
Australian and the works are Australian, and a great
swag of the shares are Australian, and all but one of
the co.’s officers are Australian, J. Bull collars Is. 2d.

North Mount Boppy is developing its
Blue Spec mine at Hargraves (N.S.W.) with some
success. The formations on this field are saddle-
shaped like those at Bendigo, but the gold-bearing
portions are not of the same geological age. 'I he
North Boppy is in 300,000 preference shares (Is.
each) and 601,828 ordinary shares, mostly held in
London. The preference shares were created in 1908,
and are entitled to 124 p.c. cumulative, so things arc
frigid for the ordinaries. As the co. is building a
battery, the Blue Spec and other mines at Hargraves
will soon get a practical test.
The Great Britain Sluicing Co., which got
to work in November, 1907, paid its 22nd div. the
other day, and that makes £11,683 on a capital of
£5OOO, of which only £3680. was paid up in cash.
The co.’s original lease near Emmaville (N.S.W.)
was supplemented by what is known as Moore’s
ground; but the latter is almost worked out, and
there are only about 50 acres of the other left—say,
five years’ work, if the ground can be all sluiced at a
profit, which is doubtful. In the hope of lengthening
its days, the co. is now boring an optioned 80-acre
block on the Y Creek, and as far as it has gone
reckons the ground worth 14lb. per cubic yard. This
is more than 41b. less than the average hitherto
worked; but the Britain ground is tough and takes
a lot of shooting, whereas the Y country is free.
The co. has about £2500 in hand after providing for
all liabilities. #
Harden (N.S.W.), which it was hoped
might get a bit to the good during the last few
months, can’t keep its revenue level with current
expenditure, and, worse still, development work below
the No. 4 level continues to give extremely unsatis-
factory results. #
Bullfinch shareholders meet in London
this month to conform with the Companies Act, but
as the co.’s financial year does not expire until the
31st inst., a full statement of the position will not be
made until the general meeting in March. D. L.
Doolette, who recently returned from London, states
that the question of development and equipment is
being considered, and all going well a treatment
plant should be up and doing in about eight months
time. The funds in hand are officially stated to be
ample for plant and all other requirements.^
Present cash position and doings of some
victims of the Bullfinch deception:—Young Bullfinch:
£750 ; abandoned Bullfinch and Camelback leases
(W.A.), and has the Blumberg mine (S.A.) on op-
tion. Bullrush Estates: £13,000; has a 12 months’
option over the Kyarra leases at Meekatharra (W.A.)
for £12,000 cash and 4000 shares, also an £BOOO
option on the Royal Standard mine at Yuin (W.A.) ;
developments are alleged to be promising in both.
Rowan’s Find: £5000; is now spending money on a
hazardous venture known as the Transvaal at Westralia
Mount Morgans, on which a balance of £4OOO is ow-
ing. Great Chaffinch: £11,000; has had an expert
sampling the Callion, at Davyhurst, which has made
fools of a lot of people in its time. Bullfinch West:
£717; now owns the King of the Hills,
at Leonora (W.A.), which, according to official
reports, is “looking promising.” Babylonian:
£2750; has apparently “skied the towel
in W.A., and taken over the Ajax at Waulcaringa
(S.A.). Bronzewing: £1800; is full up of trying to
find a mine, and proposes to liquidate. Bullfinch
South : £1765 ; co. believes that it now has something
worth having at Meekatharra (W.A.), but there are
impurities ki the ore, though shareholders haven t
been told muck about it. Golden Butterfly :£ 9000 ;
has taken the Gregory mine at Kookyme (W.A.) in
tow, and is passing word around that it has got
hold of a good thing. Greenfinch: £3500; all offi-
cial hopes are now centred on the Recovery mine’ at
Weston’s (alias Carribin), where a few thousand
tons have been developed or partly developed, though
the prospect of this show being any good at depth
is very remote. Eaglehawk: This co. struggled on as
long as it could, and then went into liquidation,
Cables have been received from London
stating that confirmatory meetings have been held m
connection with the Lake View and Oroya Explora-
tion amalgamation, and news of similar gatherings
in the case of the Yuanmi and Oroya Black
may be expected at any time. J. A. Agnew, 8., M.
and Co.’s long-headed boss in W.A., has gone to Lon-
don, and may not return for some time. W. J.
Loring will meet him at Colombo, and then proceed
to Burma. If time permits, Loring proposes to re-
turn to England via Australia. #
D. L. Doolette announces that the ore
reserves in his Corinthian North mine at Southern
Cross (W.A.) now total 158,000 tons, valued at
£200,000. This show was acquired some
aeo from the Oroya Exploration by Doolette, and it
intended to bracket it with the adjoining Conn-
thian in a London float. # *
Ivanhoe (W.A.) is credited at Southern
Cross with having taken the local Transvaal mine off
the Oroya Exploration’s hands. This sh "' as . °
recently acquired from the prospectors after a lot of
money had been splashed up in devdopment, and if
the report of the present sale be true, it makes the
second property on :he Yilgarn field that the Oroya
Exploration has bought and subsequently got rid of
during the past few months.
Marvel Loch (W.A.) has struck the lode
at 400 ft., where the ore is narrow, but g°?d. two
directors visited the mine last month, and intend to
advocate the scrapping of the m-esent decrepit mill
and the installation of 10 heau of new stamps m its
stead. » *
Northern Mines, Ltd., at Lawlers (W.A.),
lias decided to give it up, allegedly on account of
shortage of labor. Which, of course, means that the
co. can’t afford to bid high enough to get a supply.
For ever so long the ore mined has only averaged a
few dwt., and unless the full 40 head of stamps can
be kept running full time, it is impossible to make
ends meet. Shareholders have never received any-
thing. # *
Morning Star (W.A.) now has its ore
reserves estimated at 28,696 tons, of a gross value of
£67,196. Last February the figures given share-
holders were 35,664 tons, containing £83,708.
There have been one or two crushings since then, but
these could not account for the discrepancy between
the two estimates. It was proposed to reduce the
high cost of treatment by the erection of new plant,
but the mine boss has just arranged to lease a neigh-
boring battery, and so try to attain the same result
by cheaper means.
Mount Morgan Co. concluded its half-
year in November, with an output for the month
valued at £80,450. In point of value it is the best
monthly performance of the term. Copper has been
taken into account at £5O per ton, whereas the
market price is to-day over £6O, so that on the
month’s work alone there is a margin of more than
£6OOO to meet fluctuations. The gold figures of
the month, showing a I,7dwt. per ton yield, obviously
include a clean-up, and must be read with the re-
turns of the five previous months, to which portion
belongs.
The past year has been one of unrealised expecta-
tions for Mount Morgan. In November, 1910, there
was every reasonable hope that the use of Many
Peaks ore on the smelting charge, in place of barren
ironstone, would swell the profits enormously. Ihere
is still that hope, although the increased profits have
not yet materialised. That they can be made to
materialise, even with the price of copper below its
present figure, is, in the judgment of competent men,
beyond question. Mount Morgan is a barracker for
Australian brains, and is proverbially good to its
technical men. It treats them well, and pays good
salaries, but it is quite obvious that the right brains
were not selected for the present job. They were
available in Australia, and, further, for this particu-
lar metallurgical problem they were not available
beyond Australia ; and yet the co. has persevered for
a whole year without producing the increase in pro-
fits. If the Board has erred at all in permitting the
staff such a lengthy experiment, it is apparent that
it now realises that further complete reliance on that
reed is quite impossible. Audley Smith, late of
Mount Perry, was first called in; then, in addition,
the services of Dean, of Mount Lyell, were requi-
sitioned ; and it will be a shock to the copper metallur-
gists of Australia if both Smith and Dean do not, in
effect, tell Mount Morgan that it has been monkeying
with the business and that things ought to have been
put right long ago. Following close upon Smith and
Dean, arrived electrical engineer Dodd, and the
necessity for his presence clearly indicates that the
Mount Morgan job has been far too big for the un-
aided staff. This paper once wondered what would
happen to Mount Morgan if it lost Seale. It wonders
no more. In securing Dean to report, Mount Morgan
will have the benefit of Mount Lyell smelting prac-
tice, which, in its class, is not equalled in any part
of the world. The Bulletin expects that the enor-
mously-experienced Sticht will be called in to put
Mount Morgan right. In any case, had Sticht been
treating the Mount Morgan ore, he would probably
have earned £125,000 more profits than Mount Mor-
gan will show for the past year. This is a serious
business.
Doubtless the Board will take the shareholders into
its confidence, and publish the opinions of Audley
Smith, Dean and Dodd. Some of the smaller share-
holders have become alarmed, and the truth in this
case will do no harm to those who have loyally
backed the Board to do the right thing. So far the
shareholders have been expected to feel satisfied with
“explanations” from the mine. But those explana-
tions have lost their charm. If The Bulletin were any
judge of the character of the present Mount Morgan
control, it would say that the annual report just
about due will contain some frank reference to the
independent investigations which have been made,
and to what may be expected to follow.

As most of the Great Fitzroy (Q.) ore is
very silicious, the concentrator results are of special
interest. For the last month’s run, 3328 tons of
crude ore were treated, assaying 3.3 p.c. copper and
2.4dwt. gold, and the output of concentrates was 980
tons, worth 8.43 p.c. copper and 4.62dwt. gold. The
recovery of copper in concentrates was at the rate of
2J units per ton of ore treated, or 76 p.c. of copper
contained in the ore; the gold recovered was
1.368dwt. per ton of crude ore, 57 p.c. of the original
assay. . Taking copper at £6O per ton and gold at
4s. per dwt., the money value recovered was £1 15s.
sd. pgr ton of ore. This is, however, subject to loss
in smelting and refining, for there is hardly any
metallurgical operation that doesn’t involve some
loss. Although these figures have a hopeful look,
operations for November involved a loss of £3029
(revenue, £8704; costs, £11,733). These costs, by
the way, don’t include debenture interest and depre-
ciation. A failing supply of water at the mill and a
breakdown at the furnace help to account for the un-
favorable results.

Lupton’s, near Barrambie (W.A.), is the
subject of a few cheerful remarks in an official circu-
lar just issued. There are* it is hinted, 300 tons of
ore, worth £l5OO, at grass, and 450 tons, valued at
£lBOO, in sight above the 100 ft. level; also, a bat-
tery is ready 'to crush at any time. In fact, every-
thing in the garden seems lovely, until the immediate
declaration of two calls is touched on. Then one is
reminded that there may be bees, and even wasps, in
the loveliest # #
Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) has issued
another melancholy report, from which it is gathered
that the past year’s ore treatment and re-treatment
resulted in a loss of £5290. Development work was
stopped in October, 1910, and since then the co. has
been struggling to find a process to treat the sulphide
ore at a profit. The co. still has hopes, but its best
friends are dubious. Meantime the property is under
exemption, and small tributes have been let.
Gwalia Proprietary (W.A.) has struck
fresh trouble. An application for forfeiture has
been made, on the ground of the co.’s tired habits,
and the circumstance hasn’t improved the patience of
the co.’s creditors.
At Golden Ridge’s half-yearly meeting at
Kalgoorlie, the chairman owned up that the bottom
level (500 ft.) shows a substantial decrease in
width and value. As a result of this unfavorable
development the grade is to <be brought down, and,
after two more one-and-sixpenny distributions, the
quarterly dividend is to be reduced to Is. The neces-
sity for sinking a new shaft was mentioned, but,
owing to the e: '"tic nature of the lode, as disclosed
in a winze bcl. ' 30ft., this pressing matter is to be
left in abevanc_ until more work has been done at
570 ft. Meantime the future of the property hangs
by a slender thread.
Commodore (W.A.), whose shareholders
are tiring of calls, proposes to try to better things by
treating a few thousand tons of ore at the Meeka-
tharra State mill. It is hoped by this means to
rake in a little revenue for shaft sinking and develop-
ment. . * t
8., M. and Co. have thrown up the derelict
Burbanks (W.A.), and ancient Professor Nicholas,
who previously ran the show, but has lately been “on
the land,” has taken their place. The mine remains
in the hands of tribute parties for another 12
months, after which “some vigorous development” is
to be undertaken by the co. An adjoining property,
the Burbanks Main Lode, has, after many years of
painful struggle, just paid its first dividend.

The Hampden-Mount Elliott (Q.) amal-
gamation is still in the incubator. The more the
directors considered the suggested elaborate bases of
negotiation, the deeper they got in the bog; so the
difficulty Will probably be settled by each agreeing
that he’s as good as the other, in which case the
two cos. will come in on equal terms.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, has
put through a crushing, taken exclusively from No.
4 west level; 48 tons gave £7lO, averaging £l4
15s. 6d. That reads well; yet even the most hopeful
barraeker for Deeps must admit that a mine which
varies so rapidly from £3 13s. to £l4 16s. 6d. is
a bit patchy. A few days ago the reef in No. 4 west
level pinched to a mere string of quartz, but the
market recovered from that shock, on the strength,
no doubt, of the high average of the last little
crushing. * * *
Last month, Brilliant Extended, Charters
Towers, crushed 3380 tons and cyanided 2800 tons,
for a total of £7OBB. The month’s run gave a profit
of £984. For the half-year 27,580 tons were crushed
for a profit of £13,338. The half-year’s profit of
9s. Bd. per ton gives a fair idea of the value of the
40,000 tons of reserves, reckoned to carry 455. worth
of gold per ton of stone. At 4s. per share the mine
is valued in the share market at £50,000; and, as-
suming that costs can be kept down to £1 14s. 9£ti.,
some 100,000 tons of stone, worth 455., are required
to pay 4s. in dividends. The 40,000 tons in reserve
would be worth only about Is.' 6d. per share on the
same basis.
* * * *
The most enlivening news from the Oaks
Rush goldfield (N. Queensland) tells oi die discovery
of a make of good stone in Thompson’s Oaks straight
shaft. Thompson’s shares, which have been hard to
sell at a few pence, jumped to 3s. All that is
known for certain is that the assays are good, and
the reef apparently of fair size. It was struck sooner
than any make of stone was expected; hence some
of the shareholders on the spot think that it may not
be identical with the highly mineralised vein worked
on the foot-wall by the original Thompson’s party.
So strong is the suspicion that there are two reefs,
that men have been put on to unwater the old under-
lay shaft, and drive in towards the new shaft.
* * * *
The plum in the Christmas pudding of
Johnson’s Reef, Bendigo, is a dividend of 3s. per
share. This comes from the rich patch of stone got
from between 1800 ft. and 1900 ft., at a point north
of the big fault on the Collman reef. When Coil-
man and Tacchi, to the south, were paying out fat
profits, Johnson’s drove a big crosscut to pick up
the shoot at 2200 ft., but had to face a crowd that
believed the break kept the Collman shoot of gold
from going past that claim. But that crowd was
wrong; the present rich make, got by rising, netted
14840 z. from 954 tons last fortnight. The best of
it is that the depth—less than 2000 ft.—is not too
deep. A slide occurs where the gold shows, and its
influence in all probability has a good deal to do
with the enrichment. With this 3s. dividend, share-
holders in the old co. have received to date £317,000,
spread over very many years.

Mount Balfour (Tas.) float in London is
in the hands of Hector MacDonald, a straight-going
solicitor, who was mixed up with Crotty over the
Mount Lyell and North Lyell mines. His bull-dog
is perky little Langford, of the same Lyell school.
In putting the float before J. Bull, the pair have
the backing of London electrician Merz, whost part-
ner has blessed the Balfour railway line, the Stanley
harbor scheme, and the Mount Balfour mine. Mac-
Donald’s advice that a powerful London house is
behind the syndicate which is to float the co., and
that the whole enterprise is to be paid for, probably
means that he has got his old North Lyell backers
mostly Scotch —into the deal. What, MacDonald has
authority from Melbourne to do is to float a co. of
£600,000 “or more,” provided existing shareholders
get a 25 p.c. interest. The “or more” sounds very
like Langford. "But, before the float is completed,
Tub Bulletin would like to hear, from someone
qualified, something as to the outlook on the mining
side. Developments at Balfour don’t smell sweet of
late. While the railway may be justified, because of
the land and the timber, more convincing testimony
is wanted that the mines justify other than the exist-
ing tramway to Whale’s Head.

It was the Tasmanian jam people who
fossicked out the Tongkah; now the same people are
backing a tin-recovery scheme near home. They
propose to get their metal chiefly from factory clip-
pings and the rubbish-box. Some Dutchmen have an
electrolytic process for de-tinning this refuse, and it
is proposed to set it up somewhere in Australia, but
preferably in or near Sydney. It is estimated that
there is at least 4000 tons a year of “raw material’
to work on; a great part of this is now shipped to
Germany or Holland. The tin (pure) will be worth
£2OO a ton, if the market holds; the uncoated iron
or steel should find a market at 50s. or 555. a ton.
The co., which calls itself by the large name of the
Australian Electric Metal Refining Co., is in 15,000
£1 shares, of which 6134 and £ll6 in cash go to
purchase the process and part of the outfit. Very
little information is afforded as to the success else-
where, or the cost, of the plant and the process ; but
these jam people don’t usually back poor bills, and, as
the idea is to keen for the Australian a job that is
now sent to the German and the Dutchman, the co.
deserves three cheers and a lift.

McArthur River Corporation seems to be
the title-designate of the Northern Territory mines
lately introduced to Melbourne and thence to Lon-
don. This change is made because Bottomley’s
group of “Northern Terrors” has been dragged from
smelly obscurity for flotation purposes. Lionel Rob-
inson, Clark and Co. don’t want the elect to shy off
the new show; and, seeing the slating the quasi-
virtuous London financial press has just given the
“Terrors,” the firm’s anxiety is justified. “Robby”
has cabled the Melbourne syndicate the first five thou-
sand. The second will alight on P. P. Cook’s table
when the little formality of rubbing out the old
name is complete and the new co. is registered.
The Tarcoola Blocks, an Adelaide co.,
which is trying to hold the fort at one of the far-
northern S. Aus. gold fields, is finding things no
better. A couple of years ago it looked as though
the shareholders might soon get a little of their own
back, but since then the mine has only proved a
stringer, and last half-year’s outlay reached £4006,
against an income of £1358. Calls had to be relied
upon for the balance.

ROBUR
CALENDARS
This year they are exceptionally
nice, and the demand for them
is greater than I’ve ever known
it before. It’s a pity the Company
don’t send us a few more in
each Case though, because I
can honestly say if they gave us
ten times as many as they do
there would be no trouble in
getting rid of them.
Now, which one would you
like? —there are three different
ones. This Portrait of a French
Lady and her Child, painted by
herself, is very ifine—by the
way, it’s not the first time
that I’ve heard of a woman
painting herself, but in this
instance it’s in quite a different
way, and I’m fairly puzzled to
know how she managed it
If I ever go to Paris I’ll go
and see the original canvas
of this picture—it must be
worth seeing. Then there’s a
"Bushranging” one —it’s splendid;
the horses look as if they could
jump right off the picture and
keep on galloping away. And as
to "Stealing the Keys,” ’pon my
word, I believe it’s the best of the
bunch. It tells its interesting
story so well, and is so
excellently carried out in every
detail. They have fine Pictures
in Sydney—the original Paintings
of the last two I mentioned are
in the National Gallery there.
I’m afraid I can’t let you have
more than one; the truth is, I
don’t think I’ll have enough to go
aiound as it is. If, however, I
have any to spare, I’ll promise to
put another on one side for you.
Will you take the pound of
Nd. 1 Grade with you?—thanks.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, December IS, 1911,
My Dear Arini,—
Lady Poore fires off a few brisk volleys
at a 12,000-miles range. “I am considered
a confirmed Australian—aggravatingly so,
for I will say your girls are prettier, smarter
and more practical than ours. I should like
to. say, too, that, kind as my English
friends have been during the long months
when I have been physically on the shelf,
I think every day very regretfully of Aus-
tralia, and of the dear delights I enjoyed
there. They are like a line of gold on a
very far horizon, 12,000 miles of sea between
us... .1 find myself wishing I were 20 years
younger, with the chance of getting back.
....Dear, gay Sydney, and the beautiful
garden and harbor views from its Admiralty
House are never-to-be-forgotten joys.... The
house at Chatham is beautiful and spacious,
with a ballroom which would have been
delightful in Sydney, and would have made
it possible for us to have doubled the num-
ber of our guests; but we give ourselves
the pleasure of entertaining here many of
our Australian friends who are kind enough
to overlook the absence of a garden and har-
bor, which I never cease to lament....We
are expecting (October 30) a short visit
from Miss Gladys Owen and her travelling
chum, Miss Alice Norton, of Sydney....
Mr. Eric Darley and Mr. Bryan Adams, two
Australian-born lieutenants (Britain’s blue-
water hulls) came in to tea to-day.”
The optimistic Admiralty lady had her
special brand of smile severely shaken at
Bradford-on-Avon in September last. After
the manner of Alfred Jingle, I send you a
skeleton story: “Two-wheel dog-cart—slip-
pery asphalt—horse on his nose —Lady P.
on her face, pitched out of d.c. —picked her-
self up—kind Samaritans supplied balm in
Bradford; hot water for injured knee —
motored home —knee worse —doctor firm —
plaster of Paris firmer. Carried up and
downstairs in chair — hate it—getting better
—think of Australian kindness as a tonic,
say as warm and cordial as cherry brandy
—not a temperance simile —prohibition and
lemonade in the air out your way?—good-
bye.”
The Admirable and Lady King-Hall have
gone down to the sea in their official steam-
roller, the Powerful, and are liable to say
their prayers upside down, if that ancient
ark strikes the wrong end of the long wash
between Sydney and the Apple Island. A
man who once voyaged, as a guest, on the
obsolete iron barque, says it sits down sud-
denly, in rough weather, in any handy hole
in the green seas, waits till something hits
it hard underneath, then squirms over on its
side, while all its armament clatters like a
stage thunderstorm. The poor old Powerful is
advertised to have made its (positively) last
appearance off these shores. 11.M.5. Drake
will presently swim into Hobart’s duck-pond,
to pick up its Commander-in-Chief, who will
forthwith splice his maintop with the ginger-
pop of joyous greeting.
Governor Chelmsford and his lady are
wiping off big arrears of handshake. While
this letter is climbing over a linotype, State
Government House is again in the throes of
a lawn and linen party.
Knight William Russell, who clips sheep
and shears the soil at Hawke’s Bay (M.L.),
passed through this town the other day, after
a long trek to the wurlies by the Thames.
Mr. Russell is an ex-army man, whose man-
ners are said to have been “against him”
when he shook a fist in M.L., for, while
Seddon was hitting hard, Russell was look-
ing up the rules of the game.
Mr. and Mrs. “Jim” Osborne left for
America aboard the Zealandia on Monday,
accompanied by their now convalescent
child. They have been trying to get away
on a visit to the Jeffries place in America
for the past six months, but illnesses and
things kept turning up to hinder them.
Which reminds me that quite the most
foolish of recent canards is that which attri-
butes Mr. B. R. Wise’s trip to India to ill-
health. The big K.C. is fitter at the present
time than he has been for the past four
years. The Indian expedition was planned
by the Wises many months ago, and the date
was selected solely with reference to the
legal vacation period. The object of it is to
pay a visit to Mr. “Tony” Wise, who has
been earning his living on the allegedly coral
strand since he left Oxford.
Mrs. Herbert Marks has just left for Mel-
bourne, where she will meet her sister. Mrs.
Jay, who is journeying to these shores on
the incoming P. and O. steamer. Ten years
ago, Miss Pilcher —as Mrs. Jay was then—
was generally esteemed to be about the
prettiest girl in Sydney. She wedded Mr.
Jay, a London stock-broker, and hasn’t been
seen here since. Another smart and hand-
some dame is arriving aboard the same
craft, namely Mrs. “Ted” Simpson.
Mrs. Jackson Palmer (M.L.), who had
to rest her injured limb in marble hdlls (I
can’t remember which limb it was, but she
tripped on a duke’s staircase during the
Coronation crush), passed through this town
last week on the way back to Wellington.
The Duke of Norfolk’s stairs —where the
smash occurred—seem to have been just as
hard as any other stairs, but the limb
righted itself in the full blast of England’s
best strawberry patch, and Mrs. Palmer
goes home nicely mended and quite happy.
Young ladies’ “cemeteries” are breaking
up with extreme elegance on the Christmas
reef, while Dad wades ashore through large
breakers of bills that fling a foam of “extras”
over his breakfast bacon. The boy is also
going to pieces in the presence of Governor
Chelmsford, or other official dignitaries who
baste him (the boy) with remarks on the
whole duty of being a boy. Samuel Smiles,
the dreadful “self-help” person, hovers round
the boys’ speech-day burning-off service. For
my own part, 1 hate Smiles. 1 think the
ideal speech-maker for boys was the Rev.
Chadband. His oration to Jo, as delivered
in the parlor of Snagsby, always appealed to
me as one of the gems of English literature.
Professor Harper, at the annual smash of
the Presbyterian Young Ladies’ Academy,
the other day, is reported to have rushed
from Ituskin and short skirts (Ruskin is
said to have known the artistic value of a
pretty ankle) to language. The language
which the academic Scot urges for young
ladies’ use doesn’t involve a fine with the
option; it costs nothing but total abstinence
from newspaper reports of political meet-
ings, etc. The vernacular hits the air when
an Oxford graduate dusts his opponent. w ; th
the same absence of “delicacy” that i - ks
the flavor of plain Bill when he gets ex :ued.
“Avoid slang,” says the learned Harper. Yes;
try pure English on the telephone service,
and see how it back-answers in classic sil-
ence.. And endeavor to find surcease from
anguish in thinking Miltonic thoughts when
you are trodden upon by the hot and count-
less multitude in the tramcar. I have heard
of a girl whose temper was short and her
vocabulary long, but who learned to restrain
herself. The result was disastrous, for a
careless servant upset a plate of hot soup
down her back. There was a moment of
tense silence, and then she smiled an apology
to the company at the table, and went up-
stairs to her roam, and bit a sofa in two
pieces. She hurt her jaw so badly that she
gave up being reformed, and decided to let
herself go again in the old slangy fashion
when things went wrong.
At St. Vincent’s Hospital, the other day,
Mayoress Allen Taylor handed over the pro-
ceeds of the annual ball (£546) to the
Mother Rectress of that benign institution.
The same old bone of contention, supper ex-
penses, was dragged out of its hiding place
and gently gnawed by Sydney’s municipal
lady, who is against a plethora of food at a
charity ball. Mrs. John Hughes rose up and
bit the other end of the bone—the fat end.
She contended that £75, or thereabouts, had
not been as coin cast to no purpose upon the
waters (supper well and truly laid being a
reasonable bait for the male dancer), and
sat down with some severity. The Mayoress
sailed away at this crisis, in consequence of
another engagement, and cream puffs and
harmony prevailed, while the committee
ladies buried the supper hatchet till next
year.
The Christmas goose is already in the
condemned cell, or crate, and the society for
the prevention of ancient fowl masquerading
as “prime chicken” proposes to examine the
teeth of all feathered exhibits over six years
old.
The Christmas present sits heavily just
now on the chest of the Family Giver or
Headpiece, who hopes to save 6d. to
buy himself a ready reckoner, to prove that
a merry Christmas has no decent excuse for
hanging round the street corners more than
once per annum. If the General Giver has
a few shillings left over—when the season’s
greetings have stripped him to the marrow—
will he kindly unload a remnant in front of
the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Sick Chil-
dren, which is hanging all its stockings on
the outer wall, for dolls and trains and
things— please.
Mr. R. M. Pitt is alleged to be one of the
public pillars of lyric drama in this town,
for he buys opera seats at a pace that runs
away from local competition.
Opera redivivius hasn’t incited otherwise
peaceful citizens to tear up the paving stones
and throw barricades round the house of
J.C.W., Ltd, but it has driven countless
damsels from their suburban homes at an
early hour in the afternoon, and caused
them to live on their emotions, mixed with
ham sandwiches, till the gallery opens its
portals.
A glimpse of Verdi’s “Othello,” from a
remote stall on Saturday night, was a blur
of heads, legs and red drapery, with Ange-
linas baton dashing great splinters off the
air in silhouette. Sound rises, and the hid-
den treasures of the opening chorus may
have floated up to the D.C. and gallery,
while the back stalls sweltered in the centre
of a raging argument over seat selection.
Governor Chelmsford and his party, also
Lady C., got into their box with half a min-
ute to spare, before the stalls, with lights
out, black as Othello’s face, groaned under
the stampede of the Habitually Late.
The plague of darkness set in when “God
Save” fell down dead at the feet of Govern-
ment House. The opera began to rage on
top of the corpse. The stalls were filled with
moving bodies struggling to find their seats.
Only ushers who go through a special
course of obscure reading at midnight can
grapple with the stalled ox, who regularly
breaks up every 7.45 performance with the
thud of his hoofs. Neither he nor his
ticket can be identified amid the gloom. In
the distance, I saw the Angelini forelock—
agitato—and the legs of the chorus, and
one ear was filled with recrimination, and
anger poured like a cataract over my back
hair. This was something like what I
heard: —
Usher (while a bat-like procession flapped in the
offing): “You’re in your wrong seat?”
Irascible old gentleman (fortissimo): “No, I’m
not.”
Usher: “Show me your butts.” (Ironic laughter
out of the Stygian darkness. Loud altercation.)
Voice like cry or Lost Soul: “I can turn you
out of those seats; you’re in the wrong numbers.”
Irascible Old Gentleman : “Try it, then—-just
you try it.”
Shriek of Anguish: “I can send for the police.”
Ancient and Infuriated Citizen: “Go on, then!
Do it 1 I’d like to see you put me out! I was
shown into these seats.” (Frantic fumblings in the
dark, and the black bodies blot out the Angelini
silhouette.)
This was the first act of “Othello.” When
the curtain drops, the back stalls pull them-
selves together, nrl the elderly gentleman
looks at his buttu and gives a snort —almost
a howl —of triumph. “I knew they were
right,” he roars. “The girl put me here
when The lights were up, and I wasn’t going
to be turned out by a ,” etc.
Desdemona-Melba materialised in the
second act, in a gown of dull rose—too
heavy in color for the all-red setting of the
stage furniture which clashed with Othello’s
Christy. Minstrel drapery—another red dis-
play, with the white frills that belong to the
Christmas ham, wandering over the chest
and wrists. Othello-/ieni must have run out
of time or blacking on Saturday night, for
his black paws were attached to white
Italian wrists. Melba sang divinely in the
last act. The death struggle occurred in a
four-poster with a raging red awning falling
over its sides like a precipice of gore.
Othello-Zeni rushed up the steps, waved his
arms, scattered a tragic song over the plump
body of Desdemona, shook most of the breath
out of her corsage, but kindly left a few sil-
very notes of farewell, which trickled over
the footlights before the corpse came for-
ward to take the calls.
Before this meets your eye, Arini, the
Stadium carnival will have grown a corpu-
lent cheque to help the Sydney Hospital
centenary fund. Nellie Stewart, Hugh
Mclntosh and “Snowy” Baker have con-
spired together and pushed a genuine nov-
eltv—an open-air ball trimmed with a
Venus competition—into the public eye.
Nellie Stewart, Julian Ashton, Florence
Rod way, Dr. Parry, Sid Smith, Harry
Julius, etc. (I am etcetera), have been im-
pounded as judges of the beauty competi-
tion. Any Venus who feels herself mis-
judged or unappreciated is expected to state
her case to Mr. Baker, who is a man of vast
muscle and energy, and a Sabbath day’s
journey round the forearm.
Soprano Ruth Bucknall lifted up her
sweet voice in song, the other evening, in
the Y.M.C.A. Hall, in the presence of a
large supply of applause and floral tributes.
The fair-haired girl is a pupil of Mrs. Regi-
nald Quesnel, who leaves this harbor to
bloom as Professor of Singing in Adelaide.
Friends —fond, foolish friends, who prod the
Young Idea into half its troubles —have in-
formed Ruth that her voice has the Melba
quality in its limpid purity of tone. The
girl’s blue eyes look wistfully across the sea.
She dreams of castles on the Thames Em-
bankment. The Melba brain, business capa-
city, iron will, cast-iron constitution and
phenomenal capacity for work have been
the bulwarks of the Melba voice. The slen-
der little Ruth, too gentle to strike a cater-
pillar in. self-defence, had better nurse her
silvery pipe a little lonsrer in her native land
before she attempts the fierce adventure of
smiting European voice agents.
N.S.W. Women’s Patriotic Club dropped
its Tory spectacles, and took Mrs. Boult’s
clever play under its wing the other day.
“Maron, the Ethiopian,” is a racial drama
which hammers (by means of a new and
original plot) the old White Australian
ideal—a white woman and a nigger can’t
mate without disaster to the race.
The setting of “Maron, the Ethiopian,” is
a blend of magnificent color. Sensuous red
roses, the light and shade of green and gold
at Delphi, the marble palace of Meroe (black
as night), and the white face of the blind
Greek woman Who married Maron, the
Ethiopian. Here is the kernel of a fine
story. The tragedy is the restored sight
and lost illusions of the white woman.
Queen lanthe (Miss Boult) gave a marrow-
freezing answer to the color question, by
leaping off a parapet rather than live with a
coffee-colored potentate. Ola Humphrey
found the Divorce Court a less bone-break-
ing exit from her dusky Prince.
Mummer J. Plumpton Wilson, who is Sir
Gerald O’Mara in the “Lady Frederick”
cast, was married, the other day, to Eily
Malyon. She is a charming Rose in the
same eye-opening drama of the assisted com-
plexion. They make love with enthusiasm
on the stage—it happens to be in their
lines.
The bit of Test match that was torn off
last Saturday, on the Sydney Cricket
Ground, viewed by one who doesn’t know a
gcoglie from a water-cart, left a mixed im-
pression of hot wind, cold tea and agitated
millinery. A hot blast from down under
screamed across Moore Park, for Sheol is
growing old and falling into disrepair, and
the sulphur fumes leak through the sagging
doors, and a tired and careless devil no
longer attends to the rehabilitation of things
with the strenuousness of better days. An
urgent need for a younger devil becomes
more apparent every hot day. The hot wind
that was mislaid by the untidy, grey-haired
Satan already alluded to, blew 35,000 people
into the cricket enclosure. Some fell up
the steps of the members’ stand. Women’s
hats were torn off their scalps (one trembled
for the stipendiary locks that are acquired in
the shop), feathers stuck up, and the dis-
play of ankles, etc., illuminated this season’s;
fashions.
Sybil Arundale, with a wisp of wind-
blown drapery round her Principal Boy
calves, hopped down the Pavilion steps like
a little bantam hen with all her plumes
ruffled. Mrs. Walter Clark —a miracle of
decorous grey frock —got round a wind-bat-
tered corner intact. A wild hurroo of wind
landed little Mrs. Broughton on a top step,
in a cloud of white muslin. Cries of distress
from a distant seat focussed attention on a
large hat aeroplaning over the heads of
disgusted men, who had gone to see cricket,
not feathers. All the brown paper in crea-
tion blew through the air. And still the
cricket ball rolled on. Australia went out
with 447 on the board. A man with a roller
came along. Another man with a broom
rushed at the wild velocity of one mile an
hour into the cricket patch. They continued
their part of the game. The Englishmen
went in. Cricket proceeded at the same rate
of speed as the broom and the lawn roller.
A dog mixed himself up with the Test
match, and was unmixed and dropped over
a rail. I suppose he was a test dog. Clos-
ing time. Still uncertain about the personal
appearance of a googlie.
If this should meet the eye of artist Alf.
Vincent, now in Europe, he is warned to
keep out of the province, State or diocese of
Reuss. Let him try any country he likes,
except German Reuss, which will probably
seize him as an eligible bachelor, and tax
him 10 per cent, for his offence.
Yours on the lee side of Sheol.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 18, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The latest fad of the Government House
folk is breakfasting in the Botanical Gar-
dens adjacent. Even bacon and eggs be-
come romantic when taken with green
lawns, the scent of well-watered petunias,
musical cries of waterfowl and other morn-
ing extras. I often wonder why the un-
hurried classes don’t try breakfasting in the
manner of the American magazine girl. The
last one I struck “played with melons and
coffee.” In the magazine world, to “play”
with your nourishment seems to be regarded
as a sign of blue blood. A vigorous struggle
with steak and eggs is vulgar, and half a
pound of ham is sheer degi'adation.
Auntie Phipps is said to be homesick.
She is to sail for Fogland at the end of the
year, and her place will be taken by a taller
Auntie Phipps. The next sister of the
huller lady to visit here is alleged to stand
6ft. oin., without the aid of high heels.
The presentation of the late Edward Vll.’s
war banners to representatives of the Aus-
tralian infantry regiments represented in the
Boer scramble, brightened up last Wednes-
day. To receive the silken treasures, khaki-
clad men from all quarters lined up to brassy
music in front of Government House. The
Denman children were perched up aloft, with
a gay green rug flung over the grey stone bal-
c?n .y* .Lady Denman, in the porch, was a
vision in cloudy blue, with a jewelled watch,
the size of a finger nail, pinned on her
breast. Miss Quirk, with a military plume
in her hat, sported a pink parasol. The
Barttelot lady looked like a piece of Dresden
Ghana in ivory cloth.
G.-G. Denman, attired in a General’s uni-
form, strode forth attended by Aides Bartte-
lot and Stewart-Richardson, and a royal
salute broke out amongst some adjacent guns.
After this explosion he inspected the troops,
and presented the flags which, he told the
detachments, “were to be guarded as their
lives.” Banners are not dragged into war
nowadays, so the chief dangers will be moths,
burglars and : careless charladies. The
spectators subsequently retired indoors for
tea, and the soldiers marched' off with their
trophies. Major Griffiths, the exchange offi-
cer from India, and his blue-gowned wife,
were centres of interest. Colonel Chauvel,
with fair-haired Mrs. • Chauvel in black
and blue, told people the latest news
from Bananaland. Both the Colonels
Courteney were there, with their re-
spective _ wives. They command a Vic-
torian infantry regiment apiece, and it
is a bright, windless day when someone isn’t
dreadfully confused between them. The
fact that a third brother is a captain,
and that there is a budding-■Courteney
who bugles, adds to the trouble. Colonel
Ryan’s daughter looked a dinky little,girl in
a blue dress, with a waist under ller arms
and a “mutch” of fine lace. Mrs. Pearce
was one of the party, also Mrs. L. L.
Smith, whose son collected the banner for the
Sixth Regiment.
Lady Denman and Miss Quirk, with Aide
Barttelot as attendant knight, recently spoilt
a few days riding through the ranges neat
Melbourne. They spent two nights at bush,
pubs, and offsaddled occasionally on their
own for billy tea.' Barttelot, being an olcT
Indian campaigner, was able to season it
for them with a lemon when cow-juice was
not available. The two ladies rode astride
throughout the trip, her Ex. being aboard
one of the G.-G.’s hunters. During the
party’s absence, his Ex. and Chamberlain
Nevill entertained the Melba opera stars in
detachments.
The Brett-Clegg wedding was a drenched
but successful function. Captain Clegg had
been staying at Government House, and the
house party turned out gladly in his honor.
All Saints’, St. Kilda, where the knot was
tied, stands well back from the road, and
fine weather must have been confidently ex-
pected, for there was no shelter for the
motored between the kerb and the porch.
Much costly millinery was laid waste by the
falling wet, as the wearers scudded like
storm-beaten chooks for the door. The wed-
ding was not a military spectacle, both bride-
groom and best man Stewart-Richardson
donning the unsensational duds of plain citi-
zens. The honevmooners subsequently de-
parted to Tasmania. Later on, the Contain
is to take his bride to India, and show her to
his regiment, after which they sail for E»g-
land.
t A terrible misfortune happened to Aide
Stewart-Richardson while he was best-man-
ning Captain Clegg. After safely steering
the bridegroom through the performance, and
signing him over to the bride, he
looked round for his cylindrical hair-
tower, and found only a rusty, green-
black topper. Someone had been fas-
cinated by the blinding radiance of his
lid and gone off under it. Another almost
fatal accident happened at the same func-
tion. The choral procession through the
church had to be cut out, owing to the
choir’s surplices being away at the wash.
It almost cost the verger his fee. Bereft of.
their superfluous white garments, the choir
people sat glued to their seats and sang with-
out promenading.
The friends of one prospective bride in
Melbourne are organising a surprise party, to
which each girl guest is to bring a garment
she has made herself. The idea is a poetic
advance on the homely kitchen tea.
All the Clarkes and Landales, and some 400
of Melbourne’s most expensive people trained
up to Ilupertswood, on December 9, for the
wedding of Vera and George. As only the
families could squeeze into the little church,
the guests waited at the big house and pelted
the pair with rose leaves and congratula-
tions. . The bride wore the conventional
white rig, and the bridesmaids —Sister Ivy,
cousin Roma and the two Hughes—were in
pink. They and the little train-bearers had
everything on that the frock-builders could
work in.
Last Saturday morning, two misguided fe-
males were observed wringing their hands
outside the platform where panted the spe-
cial train bound for the Clarke-Landale wed-
ding. Suddenly the dolorous pair spied a
friend, and explained that they had left
home without cash, believing that the invi-
tation included the train journey. They
would be obliged to forego the feast unless
he could lend them 9s. for their fares. Of
course he produced the necessary coin.
The Dyer-Smith couple, after leaving the
altar, on December 27, will make for Egypt.
They return for a brief eight months of Haw-
thorn. Then they will pack their trunks and
set forth on an inspection of the whole rmind
earth.
The Grey-Smith girleen is having a glori-
ous clothes hunt, as papa is presently taking
her for a tour round the Durbar country.
Engineer-Commander Kimber, who steamed
here on his ship, the Challenger, strode
through Melbourne this moon with his pretty
wife, who arrived per mailboat. They
played round this city awhile, and then went
on to Sydney. By the way, only two of the
Challenger men are married —which leaves
a goodly selection for the Australian girl.
Major Lindsay, who died the other day of
heart disease, was still in the thirties. Some
six years ago, he married Mary, daughter of
the late Janet Clarke.
Doris Madden, the pretty, musical cousin
of the clan, is back with her mother from
\ ienna, where she has spent several years
patting pianos.
Henry Weedon. the rejected photographic
knight of the East Melbourne electors, is tak-
ing himself and his wife off on a holiday
tour, far from the returning officer.
Mrs. Robert Blackwood is tripping off to
Fogland, in company with Dr. Helen Sexton,
as soon as the 1911 calendar is waste paper.
Squatter Robert will follow his wife later
on.
The John Highetts arrive from England
with Pa Christmas. They are journeying
hither to see Mrs. Highett’s mother.
Vera Burgess, a radiantly fair damsel still
in her teens, has murmured “Yes” to Charl-
ton Dawson, a moneyed Maorilander from
Auckland, and a son of the late Colonel Daw-
son, of England. Miss Burgess is the only
chick of Mr. Burgess, of Medlow- Majes-
tic. Mamma Burgess cannot wll object to
the contract on the ground of v’era’s youth,
since she herself was engaged at about the
same age.
Of late the flapper has been beating Death
for the old men, and abducting them in matri-
mony. I heard a managing mother hissing
advice to a less sophisticated parent in the
tram the other day. “Get them out! Get
them out! The younger the better!” I
thQiigkt at first she was talking about
cricket, tactics.
One day recently, the staff of a soft-goods
firm toci%the afternoon off to attend the
funeral of the senior members.
I rimmed wi% ties and hatbands to match
their sadness, the juniors arrived at the
church where the service was to be held, in
the hottest part of the frizzling day. There
appeared to be nothing doing, and one or two
of the mourners wondered if they had mis-
taken the hour; however, they were presently
reassured by the arrival of several of the
heads. A long, sad superheated wait ensued.
Ihen someone tiptoed out and reverently
bought a paper, and looked with a tearful
eye at the date. They had all gone to >ue
funeral a day too soon!
The Clarke-Power booklet for children is
hardly likely to find a place on the book-
shelves of the most genteel babes. It is an
innocent rendering of the old French story
about the flea that travelled from the leg of
a dog to the leg of a lady. It takes a French
child and a nrench parent to fully appre-
ciate the flea joke.
Oscar Asche has just engaged Aubrey
Hoad (elder son of the late General) for a
long period. “Geoffrey Ilardinge” is the
stage name under which Lload unsuccessfully
endeavors to hide his limelight. He has
done a lot of work in England, and a play
of his, called “The Flail of Fate,” is now
touring the wild region which is known
amongst theatricals as “the provinces.” He
had to relinquish the leading part in it to
start his engagement with Oscar at the Lon-
don Garrick.
“Everywoman,” at the Theatre Royal, turns
out to be a very well-mounted sermon.
Eardley Turner, in a bronze cowl and green
llimelight, is Nobody, that person of whom
we speak so often. Truth (Emma Temple)
is alleged to reside at the bottom of a well
with Nobody. Youth, who is a nice girl
with tawny hair; Beauty, and Modesty, a
little duck of a girl, are Every woman’s com-
panions in the beginning. On the worldly
highway, Everywoman loses Modesty, kills
Beauty and Time, and drives away Youth
and Conscience. Wealth walks pompously
through the play as a modern American
millionaire who throws dollars to the crowd
from the steps of an up-to-date restaurant,
ana sups with pretty Vanity (Molly Lin-
den). Every scene is frocky and up-to-
date. Sir Flattery and Lord Witless are
almost 1912, so recent are they.
Hilda Spong has returned a graceful
woman. It was a slight Hilda who played
Sweet Lavender in Melbourne years ago,
though she had grown just a trifle too solid
for the Blan'olt bridge in “The Span of
Life,” just before her departure. In Wash-
ington, so Mrs. Rumor asserts, she was
bracketed with stalwart Nance O’Neil. Her
mother, Mrs. Scenic-artist Spong, was an
immense woman. One day when the Brough-
Boucicault people were frivolling at a
garden party, Mrs. Spong trailed her dress
in the damp grass. Boucicault (who was
about a quarter her size) wanted to stage
manage even the garden party. “Pick up
your dress, Mrs. Spong!” he snapped. Mrs.
Spong promptly obeyed ; but she was heard
to murmur viciously: “Some of these days,
I’ll pick up Boucicault and slap him !”
As Everywoman, the returned Australian
wears some lovely clothes. She begins in
the white draperies of the innocent, but
blossoms out into daring Parisian robes on
the' highway'of life. Modesty curls up when
she uncovers a trifle of gold undress with
much bare shoulder and arm, and displays
a jewelled peacock’s feather powder bag.
There is, also, an exquisite cloak of velvet
and lace, and an ostrich hat which must
have used up one whole bird. For her
supper with millionaire Wealth, she wears
a dress of silver and blue, which supports
itself by a band of silver over one shoulder
and a strap of blue over the other. The
supper table is covered with a brocade table-
cloth laden with roses and blue forget-me-
nots. The fur coats worn by the males are
magnificent and almost as interesting as the
frocks.
The Australian Night at the Repertory
Theatre brought some good stuff to light,
and Louis Esson made a nit with his cow
tragedy, in which he presents the bush in a
sodden condition. Someone murmured that
the playlet is to be sent to Fogland. It is
well worthy of the long-distance experiment.
Manager Gregan McMahon’s small daughter
made an appearance in Blamire Young’s’
contribution, “The Children’s Bread,” and I
glimpsed some silver amongst the presenta-
tion vegetables handed to her. Billy Moore
played his own hero lover. Edward Dyson’s
play was withheld because a suitable lover
wasn’t available. The Denmans, who have
been very faithful to the theatre all along,
were present, and a worried aide hunted
about trying to catch modest authors for
the G.-G. to congratulate.
One Melbourne man of money did a good
turn to some girl music-lovers during the
Melba season. He bought 150 reserved seats
and dealt them round gaily.
A roast chicken was the gift forwarded
last week to a star who, fearing to carry
the baked meat into her pompous hotel,
passed it on to a lesser light, who received
it thankfully. The light was walking off
happily with the bird when she ran into a
group of girls, including the sender of the
edible gift. Fearing recognition of the fowl,
she rushed back and dropped her intended
supper at the feet of the star, who was then
obliged to carry the chook out to her taxi
and smuggle it into her palatial lodging, in
order to avoid giving offence. I don’t know
whether she threw it out the back window
to the hungry lesser light, or whether the
light just went without.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Mr. and Mrs. King and their small daughter left
by Friday’s mail steamer. At Colombo they will
meet .Miss Lily Waite, and take her on to England
with them. Before marriage Mrs. King was Miss
“Peggy” Swan, of Adelaide.
Dolores did not get the big audiences she deserved
for her recent concerts. They (the concerts) occurred
in the Town Hall, “Wondergraph” having trans-
ferred itself to an open-air theatre in Pultney-street
for the summer. By the way, Wondergraph is con-
ducting a beauty competition—and has unearthed
some lovely specimens of the female sex.
The annual prize-giving of the Adelaide Lawn
Tennis Club took place on a day when the thermome-
ter was leaping skyward like an inebriated dervish.
Withal, a fair crowd turned up to watch the Governor
earn his money. Miss Helen Culross and Mrs. Swift
won the trophies for tennis and croquet, which he
and Lady Bosanquet presented.
The Children’s Hospital Bazaar—an institution in
which our Ancient Nobility takes a peculiarly warm
interest —was a record success this year. In other
respects, it was like the ordinary old bazaar of com-
merce.
Yet another musical prodigy. She is the 15-year-
old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Oldham, of
Glenelg, and her recital at the Elder Hall was a
surprise to many. In fact, several ordinarily unemo-
tional critics summed it up as a blitherer.
Talking of marvels, Daisy Kennedy, the small
genius in the fiddling line of endeavor, who went to
London to round up her career, so to speak, is said
to be doing well. I mention the fact for what it is
worth. We have yet to hear authoritatively of a
genius who has developed a wild passio-n for skittles,
or one who has been urged by her maestro to address
her energies to charring.
While on the subject of portents, Bryceson Tre-
harne is off. The Conservatorium will miss him, like-
wise the Literary Theatre.
The Society of Arts gave a cheery conversazione in
the Institute rooms, on North Terrace, last week.
Supper, music and pictures (to mention things in
their order of appreciation) were the delights offered.
Mr. Cuthbert Hawkes has been transferred by the
Queensland Insurance Company to Sydney. He and
his wife amassed an imposing collection of friends
during the five years they spent here.
The Anglican tea-cup is on the boil once more.
The insidious hoof of Romanism has been identified
in the neighborhood of the crockery. Canon Wise,
regardless of the most sacred feelings of Derry, has
been urging Confession at Christmas, and things have
got to such a pass that if someone got up and openly
advocated the N.N. Western position and the wear-
ing of Albs, Dalmatics and things at picture-shows,
Prodistantism would merely say “Toleye rso,” and go
on withdrawing its capital from the country. The
dailies are fairly bursting with correspondence on
the scandal.
“Mick” Newland and his wife (she was a Miss
Porter) are among those who have had the honor of
being wrecked in the Delhi. For years the family
has been forging steadily ahead, in a social manner
of speaking, and this should put a glorious cap on
everything. The cable doesn’t mention if the Duke,
before hurrying discreetly ashore, wrung the hand of
Michael in affectionate farewell (“Mick” being a com-
moner, had presumably to wait with the herd, to be
rescued later), but I am inclined to trow, aye, almost
to bet, that the Duke did. Of late, the Newlands
have lived in S’Africa, and now and again an article
in one or other of our dailies has indicated “Mick’s”
®P ln j on of S’African affairs. The Delhi wreck is the
third catastrophe in which a member of the Porter
family has been involved of late.
The inter-collegiate cricket match allured multi-
tudes of admiring small sisters and cousins to the
Adelaide oval. St. Peter’s won, amid shrieks of- ap-
plause from the blue-badged section of the crowd,
the rival colleges “broke up” about the same time,
and the Governor said the same nice things to each.
Dn Tuesday the shareholders of the Queen Adelaide
Club met, and changed that institution from a pro-
prietary concern into a company. Apropos of which,
J-be Lyric Club has just passed through a particularly
black hour. The members were informed that the
institution, in which they took so justifiable a pride,
was in the hands of Cohen, or his equivalent, to the
tune of £9O. Furthermore, it was mentioned that
the club must either pay up or burst. The matter
was attended to by a couple of public-spirited club-
men, and all is now peace and joy. The club’s next
business is to re-establish itself in new premises.
The Appendreena Dramatic Club staged “A Builder
of Bridges” at the Walkerville Hall on Saturday
night, which (thank the Lord!) was cool. The hail
was filled, and the club’s guests behaved as guests
should.
The Harry Duttons are back from a trip which was
planned for three weeks, and lasted nearly three
months. Fishing in Maoriland and a study of the
simple life in the South Sea Islands filled in their
time. They had with them Miss Nellie Fothering-
ham.
The University “boys,” or asses —which you will—
processed through the streets on Friday evening,
arousing hearty derision where they didn’t inspire
pitying contempt. The wretched lads think the
grinning worker admires, and is amused at their
annual outbreak of idiocy. It is not so. The
worker mostly grins from smug joy at the fact that
he was never as one of these. One of the students’
“jokes” consisted in sprinkling the crowd freely with
flour and water—a brand of humor that, in the
opinion of your correspondent, deserves the attention
of the Law.
This year’s Rhodes scholar is E. Britten Jones, who
narrowly escaped the same honor at the last contest.
He’s a popular youth, and his people are well known
in Adelaide.
Mr. Arthur Otto, a one-time teacher of music in
this city, is giving concerts in London as Arthur
Kingston-Stewart. The critics praise him warmlv.
Had he thought to adopt some such cognomen a
Alured BTeurieu de Plantagenet, their encomiums
might have been absolutely torrid.
At Riverton, the other day, a hearse bolted —that
is to say, the horses associated with it did. The
driver was flung from his seat and run over, thus
bringing off .what is commonly regarded as one of
Life’s million-to-one chances.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
The approaching marriage of Miss Verney
and Captain Newton, of Queensland, is of
interest to many folks in this State. The
bright-faced Titian-haired young woman
was extremely popular hereabouts a year or
more ago. Captain Newton is a brother of
Mrs. Lang Want. He toiled manfully at
the A.D.C. business for some years, but de-
cided, latterly, that there wasn’t enough
money in it. He has now taken up a selec-
tion, or whatever you call those slabs of
country which the Queensland Government
allows the land-hungry to ballot for till they
begin to feel as though life was one vast
penny dip, and expects to be a bloated
squatter in no time, or ’thereabouts.
“Vag”: The highly respectable, yet, withal, some-
what bedside humor of Harry Lauder is responsible
for half his vogue. An example of it occurred in
N’York the other night, when Henry’s boat was late
on the ferry trip from England,- as a result of which
he didn’t turn up to do his stffhtiat the Manhattan
Opera House till 1 a.m. the-iiext morning, so to
speak. To the audience which clamored for more of his
resonant kail.vardings, the Caledonian wit ultimately-
remarked: “Ye can please your sels, but Ah’m awa tae
bed. What d’ye suppose Ah’m tae tell the wife?”
There you have a large section of Lauder’s box of
tricks, in epitome—namely, homely sentiment, com-
bined with a faint—very faint—suggestion of im-
propriety.

A Good Square Meal.
«
What the dyspeptic subject
mostly longs for*
Treatment for Indigestion that pots
the stomach into condition to
digest ordinary food.
The Dyspeptic who wants a good, square
meal, and knows that he will suffer it he
eats one, hnds poor consolation in picking
and choosing a diet. The only real cure tor
Indigestion is treatment that will enable the
stomach to digest good solid food a steak
and vegetables without trouble.
The tonic treatment for Indigestion is
based on the contention that Indigestion
occurs when the organs of the stomach have
become too weak to digest ordinary food, and
that only the restoration of the stomach to
a proper state of tone will cure the trouble.
From their blood making and general tonic
qualities, the use of Dr. Williams 1 ink
Fills have been found of great value in Indi-
gestion. Amongst many successful cures we
might mention that of Mrs. Phillip. Higgin-
bottom, of 59 Lennox Street, Itichmond,
Melbourne. Mrs. Higginbottom stated:—
“Several months back my health was very
unsatisfactory. My appetite went off and 1
would get Indigestion as soon as I swal-
lowed anything, so that at last I was afraid
to sit down to a meal. I would feel so sick
that I would turn at the sight of food,
even if it were just an egg. I would get
thumping bilious headaches that made me
think my temples were bursting, and pressed
down on my eyes the live long day, till 1
could hardly see or hold my head up. After
a bit of fond my mouth would fill with a hot.
stinging, bitter fluid, and my mouth would
have such a nasty taste. My tongue was
always dried and thickly coated. I lost flesh
greatly and my skin turned as sallow as
possible. I would get such dizzy turns and
my head would feel as heavy as lead. A
mist would come before my eyes and black
specks that made every line that I might
be reading waver before me. I could not
be bothered to speak to anyone, I felt so
wretchedly low in spirits. I noticed my
heart beating furiously if I had any exer-
tion, so that I hated to go out anywhere. I
would have to loosen my clothes every now
and then with the wind in my system. 1
would want to sit down all day, I
would feel so drowsy and heavy, and too tired
to do much work. I can, however, speak
most highly of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
My health has been splendid since I took
them. My appetite is good and all the heavy
weighty feeling has gone. I heard of them
through a friend when I was living in Clif-
ton Hill, and the first few doses relieved me
a little and encouraged me to keep on. Two
boxes completely cured me.”
Don’t let any dealer talk you into taking
something which he says is “just as good."
If you are pestered to take a substitute,
send 2/9 for one box. or 15/3 for six boxes,
to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Aus-
tralasia, Ltd., Sydney.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Tasmania, acording to the Fisher Govern-
ment’s proposals, is to get a lift out of the
mire in the shape of a grant of £500,000,
paid by 10 annual instalments. The amount
will do Tassy very little good while it sticks
to its policy of selling all its best natural
opportunities to foreign syndicates, and cul-
tivating the absentee as if he were a won-
derful and heavenly pot plant. In other
words, it isn’t likely to make the island a
much bigger contributor to the Federal rev-
enue than it is now, and while it remains in
its present condition it is a very unprofat-
able member of the Commonwealth. A very
much bigger grant, coupled with hard and
fast conditions of reform, would have been
a better speculation.
Although the S. Aus. Opposition has been
making such a fuss concerning the proposal
of 'the Verran Government to start Govern-
ment brickworks, not a word was said
against the establishment of State join-
ery works, which involved an expenditure ot
thousands of pounds. The only difference
between the two acts is that one was done
by a “Liberal” Government, and was good
business ; the other, being done by a Labor
Government, is, of course, dreadful Social-
ism.
As might have been expected, Vic. Public
Works Minister Baillieu, acting as inquiry
agent for the Weary Cabinet, decides that
the time is not ripe to establish State brick-
works. The Government still owns the
Thornbury paddock that Bent bought, and
the machinery is still stored away some-
where, so there is no obvious reason why the
Vic. Government shouldn’t supply at least
its public works with slabs of burnt clay at
245. or 255. per thousand. The Melbourne
combine has lately raised its figure from 355.
to 385., but Baillieu says this means only
£36 on a £4OOQ building, which isn t
worth worrying over. That is the Weary
way of viewing the case ; the progressive man
would say that, as he can produce bricks at
265. per thousand, he would in reality save
£]44 on a £4OOO building. Meantime, the
N.S.W. Government goes on making bricks,
and encourages the stupidest section of the
Wade crowd to go on throwing clods at the
enterprise, quite satisfied that it will be able
to throw all those clods back presently. For,
given any sort of management at all, the
thing simply must pay, inasmuch as the
works have a steady market in the Govern-
ment itself, no canvassing or advertising
charges, no bad debts, no anything except the
bare cost of manufacture.
EXPEDITION!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne. —Mr. Fuller, in the House of Repre-
sentatives, drew attention to a report that the men
employed on the Federal capital work had been dis-
chaigfA MaUey ga j ( j that the roads in the territory
having been put into first-class shape, all the men
were no longer required.
Mr. Fuller: Is everything being pushed on expe-
ditiously ? /T , , .
Mr. O’Malley: Oh, yes. (Laughter).
—Federal Parliament proceedings.
Well, well! isn’t this fun!
How reminiscent this is
Of the Web Penelope spun
While waiting for Ulysses—
When the Suitors would come and gaze in amaze,
and ask suspiciously—
“ Lady, excuse our doubt, but is everything being
pushed on expeditiously?”
And Penelope would smile deliciously,
And tilt her fair, white chin capriciously,
And say: “Oh, yes!”
Presto! the time, the place
Change as if magically!
Fuller, with anxious face,
Is questioning King O’Malley
In Parliamentary phrase, which is oft used meretii-
ciously,

In fact, he asks it somewhat viciously!. ..

BOYLE TRIPE.
HOW FATNESS IS DIMINISHED.
Pronounced stoutness is one of the most
aggravating of the afflictions “that flesh is
heir to,” and is generally accompanied by
ill-health and impaired vitality. There is,
however, an excellent remedy within every-
body’s reach, namely, the Marmola Prescrip-
tion Tablets, which constitute a perfect
home treatment for obesity. The basis of
composition is, of course, the famous Mar-
mola Prescription, of which the great re-
ducing efficacy and strength are fully con-
centrated in the portable tablet shai , The
dose is one tablet after each meal ana one at
bedtime. The fast-diminishing fatness—
sometimes at the rate of five or six poumlg a
week —is, as it were, a signal for the rapid
recovery of strength to the muscular and
nervous systems, and in thus regaining
vigor the whole body regains shapeliness
and slenderness. The removal of the exces-
sive subcutaneous fat leaves the body com-
pact and the figure trim, the limbs slender
but firmly and roundly moulded. The
double chin subsides, and the charming con-
tours of the face and throat are restored,
while the complexion is greatly benefited.
Marmola Prescription Tablets are sold by
chemists, price 3/6; or, post free, of the
Marmola Company, 5 and 7 Barrack Street,
Sydney, N.S.W.*
Note —For those who prefer the liquid pre-
paration, chemists are still dispensing the
famous prescription as follows: —One ounce
of fluid Extract of Glycyrrliiza 8.P., one
ounce of pure Glycerine 8.P.. one half-
ounce of Marmola, and mix with peppermint
water to make six ounces in all. The dose
is two ieaspoonfuls after each meal.
Railway Commissioner Tait is heard of
again in his native wilds. When that won-
derful Canadian resigned his job as Rail-
way Commissioner in Victoria after the
Richmond smash (which followed close upon
the Sunshine horror), it was understood
that he wasn’t fleeing from the wrath to
come, but was going, according to a long-
established purpose, into elderly and dig-
nified retirement. Now, however, he is
heard of as an applicant for a railway man-
agership in Canada. So it may be, after
all, that he quitted Victoria, not with a
view to dignified retirement, but because he
felt that the record of muddle and slaughter
had made his position untenable.
Maoriland appears to have just missed
National Prohibition and Universal Drought.
There was a majority for the utter oblitera-
tion of the beer that perisheth. But it
wasn’t quite the statutory majority. Still
there is no reason for the pious folk to lose
heart. Their cause is looking up. And
when liquor is really blotted out, the aboli-
tion of tobacco will naturally follow. After
that, there should be a crusade against cheese
and late hours, both of which are nefarious.
And something ought to be done in the way
of Prohibition of Beetroot —a horrible sub-
stance which smells like a decayed octopus
mixed with a dead umbrella that had led a
bad life.
They are humorless folk who run the Vic-
torian Society of Free Workers. Lately
they wrote to Prime Minister Fisher, asking
if the “preference to unionists” policy would
apply to them, they being pure-breeds of
the first water, so to speak, and duly
branded under the Trades Unions Act.
Fisher used no sophistry in his reply. He
coldly remarked that, as the society’s rules
provided that “no member of any trade
union or of any organisation formed under
the provisions of the Commonwealth Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Act can be ad-
mitted to the F. W. Society,” it was con-
trary to public policy to recognise them in
any way. Fisher now expects to hear
from a Society of Thugs, asking that citizens
shall call for its members, instead of the
police, when they want assistance.
Some people are never satisfied. The
other night, in the N.S.W. Assembly, Minis-
ter for Works Griffith, in reply to Opposi-
tionist Dan Levy, who had yelled “Bounder”
at him, remarked :
If there is anything worse than a dog robbed of its
bone, it is a Hebrew politician robbed of a possible
portfolio.
Whereupon Levy became enraged, and de-
manded a withdrawal; and when Griffith
agreed to withdraw, and informed the House
that, on reflection, he had to admit that Mr.
Levy was neither a Hebrew nor a politician,
the fury of Levy was like to that of Jehu,
the grandson of Nimshi, wffien he made a
bee-line for Joram, except that he had less
luck.
A NATIONAL PRIDE.
As an Australian lie was proud of the national
debt, seeing that it was nearly all invested in repro-
ductive works. — Liberal Member in Australian Par-
liament.
COHEN : “Mine Liberal friendt was quite
right; raising new loans to pay the in-
derest on old ones is most certainly repro-
ductive vorks."
The Age, after persistently analysing the
voting to demonstrate its conviction that
Labor is over-represented in all the Houses,
foolishly allowed Prof. Nanson to ring in
these figures in the course of a general argu-
ment on the workings of “preference” at the
recent Vic. elections :
For instance, it has been estimated that the full
strength of the Labor vote is 175,766, whilst that of
the non-Labor vote is 263,155. Now, if these figures
are correct it is manifest that Labor ought to have
secured 26 seats and the Ministerial party ought not
to have had more than 39. But Labor has only
secured 19 seats, whilst the other party has no
fewer than 46.
Bald-faced Davy Hall is developing into
one of the witty members of the Federal
Labor party. He has modelled himself upon
Attorney-General Hughes, and is developing
the same qualities of ironic humor. On the
Electoral Bill, the other day, he was ad-
vancing arguments against postal voting.
“I’ve been a J.P. myself,” he said, “and I
know how it is done. I was called in to
witness a vote, and the elector said to me:
‘How shall I vote, sir?’ ” “What did you
say?” asked Joe Cook. “I gave her the
proper answer,” replied David. “But wiiat
I was going to say was that we were beaten
by five to one on postal votes, I was the
only J.P. on our side. There were five on
the other.”

THE WATCHER.
A woollen mill will be the next Federal activity
undertaken by the Defence Department. The Minister
lias been informed that Mr. A. Smail, recently
selected in Scotland as manager, will shortly arrive
in Australia....!/?'. Small’s fast duty in Australia
will be the selection of a site for new mills. —Sydney
Telegraph ( breathlessly ).
“P.X.” quotes a case: —
A few months ago I met one of the most decent
employers I know, and congratulated him on his
latest proof of decency. He runs a big business, and
has just formed it into a company, i knew he had
done it to simplify the process of transferring an
interest in the concern to some old employees, who
had worked side by side with him in building it up.
There was no other reason; he didn’t get in a penny
'of new capital, and didn’t sell, or propose to sell, any
of his scrip. He merely wanted to give and go on
giving old employees a share in the business they
had helped to create. One would have supposed that
the Labor party, of all people, would have said this
etnployer was a cut above the ordinary, and that this
soft of profit-sharing, person deserved encouragement.
But, instead of giving him three cheers, the N.S.W.
Labor Government hits him with extra taxation. Had
he been the usual, hard, selfish employer, who collared
the whole of the profits for himself, it would have
levied from him about Bd. in the £ of the income
of his business. Being the sort of employer that the
Labor party says an employer ought to be, it levies
Is. 2d. in the £ of the income.
“J.P.” sends along the baseless fabric of
his dream: —
The “Catholic vote” is going to be
one of the doubtful factors in the
next N. S. Wales elections. For one
thing it is mostly Irish, and the
Hibernian’s sympathy never stays long
with the man on top. lienee the an-
cient gag about the Irishman being
“agin the Government.” I have
Romanist friends of Irish extraction
who, I am convinced, would develop
into passionate upholders of Dill
Snowball, if that Orange myth only
fell on sufficiently evil times. Wade
and Wood have but to drop a few
feet lower, politically speaking, to
have all these one-time enemies stand-
ing to them like monoliths.
The difficulty which faces any party
that tries to keep a grip on the ultra-
Catholics, while in office, is the im-
possibility of granting some of their
demands and not, at the same time,
alienating the huge body of electors
who don’t mix religion with their
politics. Logically, the Labor party
would be no more justified in accept-
ing the Church’s education policy, for
example, than it would be in replac-
ing the State railways with private
enterprise lines. “Liberalism” has
been annoying many Catholics for
years past by refusing certain of their
demands. Labor is now faced with
the same old problem, and the out-
come is likely to be the same.
And there is the factor of the
Catholic Press. In the Cardinal’s
day it would go as hot and strong on
the Labor ticket as it liked. But
Archbishop Kelly is not an ardent
democrat, in the brief time he can
spare from Church work and religious
exercises. The Press already shows
signs of the new regime. As it has
a goodish circulation, and as the
Telegraph and Herald do their best,
by reprinting extracts from time to
time, to ensure that non-subscribing
Romans shall not miss any anti-Labor
stuff that it prints, its influence should be felt.
Taking one thing with another, State Labor will be
liable, in my opinion, to lose at next elections about
40 per cent, of the essentially “green'’ vote it polled
last April.
upon Premier McGowen’s
wearisome reiteration of “the dear old
Motherland” gag since he returned from the
Coronation folly, comes the announcement
to the N.S.W. Public Service, from the
Cabinet, that in future State legislators are
not to be styled “M.L.A.” in official corres-
pondence, but “M.P.” More piffle !
Strange old bones and ghosts are dug up
at times in Parliament. As a rare sample
ex-Salvationist Bruntnell, of N.S.W. Assem-
bly, desires to know :
(I.) flow many men were included in the Soudan
Contingent ?
(.Z.) In what year was the contingent despatched?
(3.) How many engagements did they take part
in?
(4.) How many were killed in action?
(5.) How many died from other causes?
(6.) How long was the contingent away?
(7.) What was the cost to New South Wales?
(8.) What Government, was in power when the
contingent was despatched?
Probably Bruntnell will next rise to ask the
Chief Secretary how many letters there are
in the-alphabet.

Premier McGowen, of N.S.W., recently
assured a deputation from Newcastle that
Sydney would always be “the distributing
centre, not only of N.S.W., but of the whole
Commonwealth.” Apparently, McGowen
thinks Australia is about the size of Bel-
gium. If this vast country is going to be
so little developed that it can do with one
distributing centre, or even Ayith half a
dozen, then it might as well write itself
down a failure. Will McGowen kindly come
out of his burrow at Redfern and try to
think in continents, not in suburbs?
“Maorilanc!er” writes: —
In the revolt which swept Premier Ward’s majority
out of the M.L. House of lteps. a few days back, no
less than four ex-Ministers of the Seddon-Ward Ad-
ministration were handed their pass-out tickets. The
oldest was T. Y. Duncan, who served in the Reps, for
30 years, during six of which he was Minister for
Lands under beddon, after the death of John
McKenzie. McNab and I'owlds joined Ward in 1906,
the former as Minister for Lands and the latter as
Minister for Education. At the 1908 polls McNab
was defeated, and not long back I'owlds resigned
from the Cabinet, in the hope of forming a new
party. The fourth of the unlucky crowd was A. W.
Hogg, who, after a brief stay in the Government,
found himself unable to agree with Ward, and handed
back his portfolio.
Two members of the M.L. Ministry were
returned unopposed at the recent general
elections —James Ca. oil, Native Mini-
ster, and A. T. Nga i, representing the
Maori race ; one, Attorney-General Findlay,
failed to secure a seat, and most of the others
had a rougher passage to make port than in
11)08. Premier Ward’s majority was 2000
in that year, but it has now clambered down
to GOO; Millar, Minister for Railways, who
was 2500 to the good at Dunedin West in
1908, scrambled through this time, after a
second ballot, with only GOO to spare; R.
McKenzie, Minister for Public Works, went
down about 400 votes in public estimation;
T. Mackenzie, Minister for Agriculture, left
the South Island and carved a new political
home for himself, in the wilderness of Eg-
mont, with 300 votes in hand. On the other
hand, Minister for Internal Affairs Buddo
increased his majority over that of 1908
from 77 to 216, which proves nothing that
can be published in these days of edged libel
laws.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Judging by the first Test at Sydney, “big”
cricket is preparing for its funeral. Some games
can be played for their own sake, but big cricket
is not one of them. It has to draw the crowd to live,
and’to draw the crowd it has to sparkle. The first
Test had about as much sparkle in it as the beer left
in the glass the night before. It was a dreadful ex-
perience, which reached its culmination on Saturday,
when 30,000-odd barrackers and admirers and fol-
lowers of the game swarmed into Sydney Cricket
Ground, and showed that they were under the impres-
sion the game was still a live one. But that day at
least they did not get the value of their co.n, and it
was worth 10 times the money to sit there chewing
the dust and picking the paper out of the hair.
I here was no demonstration; the crowd was struck
dumb, and like Mulcahy, could not find language
equal to the occasion.
Victor Trumper’s 113, in the first test at
Sydney, is the sixth century the leviathan has smit-
ten in test matches, a record well ahead of all other
aspirants. It was a carefully-built-up century, in
building which he took no risks he could avoid, and
treated the bowlers with profound if not courtly re-
spect. But it lacked snap and fire and dash, and a
Trumper without these attributes is like —well, he’s
like a glass without liquor. Anyhow, he took 226
minutes to pile up 113, and the dailies described him
as a “new Trumper.” In reality he was a petrified
Trumper, who had become such a master of dreary
slowness that he shamed the very snails.
English batsman Hobbs celebrated a birth-
day on Saturday by painfully inflicting 63 (not out)
on* the Sydney thousands who choked and gasped in
the dust. This tally was amassed with due thanks
for the blindness of Captain Hill in failing to check
llobbs’s efforts at the “on” side of the wicket. On
Monday an inspiration hit Hill, and he took up a
residence on the vacant position, and gathered in the
catch that had begged so loudly all Saturday for a
recipient. Hobbs’s 63 runs were piled up in 167 min.
—a careful, dreary, horrible effort, which showed a
special fondness for fast bowling, and presented a
broad bat alike to the twirly bowlers and the bowlers
who didn’t twirl.
* * #• *
“Blackbutt” says terrible things: “Cap-
tain Clem Hill did not handle the Australian XI
with Napoleonic skill in the first innings of the Test.
The bowling was wearisome. Cotter and Armstrong
being kept on too long, with the result that, in-
stead of smashing up the batsmen, they got them
“set.” And even Whitty was persevered with to a
waste of the flesh. The Australian bowlers may have
appeared to excel themselves, but, truth to tell, it
was merely the slowness and solidity of the M.C.C.
batsmen which gave the complexion to the perform-
ance. And the placing of the Australian field was a
thing to move a man to swear language. It was
blanky awful, in fact, and the fieldsmen gazed won-
deringly instead of falling quickly into their places.
It was" not the Australian XI of yore; it was a
huddled, varied, shandy-gaff kind of gang as com-
pared with the Xl’s of other days.
The bright spot in the dreary waste of in-
ternational cricket is English wicket-keeper Strud-
wiek, a dandy worker of purest ray, who toils in a
clean, crisp manner, and on the leg-side is abso-
lutely brilliant. In the Australian first innings he
caught Bardsley, stumped Armstrong, and upset
Hill’s wicket when the Australian captain tried to
steal one to go on with. Certainly 26 Sundries swelled
the Australian total, but most of them were not the
sins of Strudwick. Against an Australian XI, at
Brisbane, Strudwick snapped up no less than four
wickets, and otherwise covered himself with
J. W. H. T. Douglas probably puts up a
world’s record by captaining a team in his first ap-
pearance in test cricket between England and Aus-
tralia. As far as experience goes, Clem Hill is on
a good wicket, having scored 2386 runs in test
matches before the English skipper had made his ap-
pearance in internationals. “Johnny’s” record in
first-class cricket in England is: Batting, 7921 runs,
average 234 ; bowling, 13,640 runs, 566 wickets,
average 25. *»
* * * *
Stand up, and charge the glasses for Roy
V. Minneftt, the Australian colt. In his first test he
has scored 90, and the difficulty of scoring a century
in a test is evidenced by the solemn fact that, out of
98 Australian players who have taken part in tests,
only four have put up a century in their first match.
Minnett got so close to it that the record list
trembled. Roy is one of the three brothers who have
claims for high seats in big cricket when the selec-
tors wake up or get sober. In the last three niatches
he has scored as follows: Against South Australia,
nine and 87 (not out) ; M.C.C. at Brisbane, 69;
First Test, 90.
The fight for the Sheffield Shield now rests
on N.S.W. and Victoria, South Australia having re-
ceived its third jumping on at Sydney recently, when
Ma wiped out the Crow State by 361 runs. Ma
slogged up 316 and 352, while South Australia made
hard labor in scoring 209, and then collapsed for 98.
The Murray State is leading just now, having scored
two wins to Ma’s one.
The M.C.G. team versus an Australian XI
at Brisbane, last week, gave an opportunity to some
of the smaller lights to shine in first-class cricket.
The match was a sop to the appetite of the Banana-
landers —the best the Board of Control could afford,
as there were no Test fixtures looking for a place to
settle in : and as the Northern State had seven plavers
in the XI, Bananaland felt well pleased. England
piled up 267 (Douglas 101) and 279 for the loss
of four sets of timber : while an Australian Xl’s only
effort reached 347 (Crawford’s 110 being the first
centurv made against the M.C.C.).
•** ■ * *
Last Saturday was a batsman’s day so
far as Melbourne Pennant cricket was concerned.
The day’s scores included Kortlang (Essendon) 120,
Deas (S. Melb.) 114, and McKenzie (Fitzroy) 99;
while “Freddie” Vaughan hit up 202 (not out) on
behalf of Melbourne, which is engaged in a contro-
versy with Collingwood. “Freddie’s” score suggests
that the ’Wood bowlers have so far failed to discover
his weakness on the leg side. In the Fitzroy v.
Carlton match, the first ’Roy partnership—Kiernan
and Colin McKenzie —was well past the century be-
fore segregation was effected. The score stands:
Fitzroy (first innings), eight for 261. Northcote,
which is arguing the point with Prahran, was sacked
after compiling the moderate total of 203. P’ran
then went in, and lost two wickets for a paltry 14.
The result of this match, which is awaited with in-
terest, as the two teams are practically equal, will
probably depend as much upon the weather as upon
anything else. Further Pennant discussions are now
postponed until January 6, owing to inter-State and
Test attractions.
* * £ *
The excellent showing of colt Minnett in
the Test didn’t impress the N.S.W. selection com-
mittee muchly, judging by its choice of a team to
roam through the southern States. The players who
have just been doing hard labor in the Test match
could easily have been stood on one side to dry, con-
sidering the hot weather, and some of the army of
promising youngsters given a chance to prove their
mettle. The selection committee is evidently a hide-
bound body which, like Ibsen’s Master Builder, fears
the younger generation.
R. A. Duff, one of the most fearless bats-
men Australia has produced, fell to the Master
Bowler at Sydney last week, and was buried with
cricketing honors. Once Duff and Trumper usually
began Australia’s innings in test matches, and though
Trumper was then at the height of his glory, Duff’s
was never dimmed by comparison. Duff visited
England in 1902 and 1904. In the off year (1903)
he piled up 748 in the season’s inter-State matches,
included in which were bright first-wicket efforts
(with Trumper) of 298 against South Australia, and
267 against Victoria.
The horse is passing with a vengeance
these days, giving place to the automobile and the
steam waggon. In London, one company alone is
now running 1220 motor-’busses, transporting
300,000,000 people per year, which is equal to taking
the whole population of the late Chinese Empire
for a joy ride. Huge motor-lorries are becoming,
quite common in the streets of Sydney and Mel-
bourne, carting wool, iron, and everything else that
used to be drawn by toiling horses; and most of the
big drapery and grocery firms now make suburban
deliveries by motor. But the most significant sight
this writer has seen of late was that of a huge steam
waggon toiling out from Bathurst, loaded up with
mining machinery for the wilds. The horses along
the track regarded it very apprehensively.
* * * *
The new motor tariff is something of a
blunder as it stands at present, with its duty of 15
per cent, on foreign chassis and_ 10 per cent, on those
from Britain. The duty was well meant, because it
is provided that if the chassis parts are assembled
in Australia they come free from Britain, and pay
only five per cent, if from foreign lands. But the
trouble is that the motor makers are such a haughty
crowd. They make more profit on an assembled
chassis, and they want that profit; and their patent
rights render them immune from competition. What
is required is a short clause or a special Act pro-
viding that unless the patents are worked in Aus-
tralia the patent rights will immediately lapse. At
present Australia is importing between £750,000
and £BOO,OOO worth of chassis per annum, and the
increased tariff is going to hit the people who buy
them. It ought to be so designed as to hit the
people who sell them.

The recently-published story of the Ger-
man preparation for the invasion of France by motor-
car bears out this paper’s repeated forecast that the
battle of the future will be an engagement between
opposing squadrons of automobiles. The German
authorities had rushed almost every available car
to the frontier, and made elaborate arrangements to
seize the cars in the French frontier towns. Had
war started, no less than 28,000 men, accompanied
by armorned vehicles, q tted with machine artillery,
would have been let loot, on France within an hour.
Think of it—2B,ooo men a. "e to travel 40 miles an
hour! The damage that hoi ,'e could have done in
a few days, unless headed off by a similar horde,
would have been terrific. Of course it does not apply
so much to Australia, for this country, the ground
not being cleared to the same extent as in Europe,
does not lend itself to motor cross-country work. All
the same, writer saw Herbert Garrett drive his 25-
h.p. Fiat a good many miles through the Capertee
Valley, over fallen trees, between stumps, and up
the sides of embankments, without impairing the
efficiency of the trap in the slightest. The forth-
coming Dunlop relay despatch ride from Adelaide to
Sydney is expected to throw much light on this sub-
ject, and the Commonwealth military authorities are
keenly interested.

The attention of the Amalgamated Wow-
sers is directed to what can be only interpreted as a
display of Divine displeasure on Saturday last. At
a race meeting at Deagon (Q.), evidently named
after Dagon, the heathen god of the Philistines, the
first race was just about due .when a blizzard struck
the whole show, carried away the roofs of the build-
ings, split the hobble skirts of the degraded women
who attended the unholy function, and covered every-
body with soil and dust. Then the heavens split and
the rain poured down, and, turning the dust and dirt
to mud, made a pretty picture of everybody, And,
in spite of this fearful hint, the sin-besotted wretches
did not go home. After washing the dust and mud
out of their throats with drink from the wrecked bar,
they went on with the racing, and swore they had a
great time. Now. as not one single “prize-fighter”
was 'struck by lightning, or got covered with mpd,
isn’t it time the Amalgamated Wowsers left: boxing
alone, and started on a crusade against horse-racing?

The college cricket match in Adelaide
brought out some useful players. Prince Alfreds
have been rather under a cloud since the supply of
Hills ran out (Clem came about the middle of that
big family). Their wicketkeeper and top-scorer,
Darling (72), is a nephew of Joseph, the ex-Austra-
lian captain. The brilliant Steele made 65, but was
run out in the second go, when the whole side : flopped
out for 105, and left St. Peters winners by an innings.
Fot the winners, Moyes and Auld made 72 and 65
also; but there were others. Governor Bosanquet, in
his enthusiasm, told the winners they were the best
school team he had ever seen anywhere—which is
gross flattery. , '
* * * *
J. E. Brewer, back from England after*
eight years’ absence, gave some interesting talk to
Adelaide interviewers. He has bought a station on
the Lachlan, and will drop horse-training, though he
has brought a few good goers with him. R. Wootton
stands in on the station venture, and Stanley Woot-
ton is coming out to give a hand, having thrown up
riding. Frank Wootton is putting on weight—Bst.
51b. already-—and cannot “last” much longer.
Brewer thinks Australian riders compare favorably
with English, but that Australian horses don’t.
Good mares are specially needed here; South America
bids much higher money, and so gets the pick of the
English studs. Brewer remarks on the general atti-
tude of suspicion in Australian sport—the readiness
to believe that something somewhere is not on the
square. As one result, a beaten horse has to be use-
lessly flogged up the straight, or else accused of
stiff running. “I have been at the game now for a
long while, and have found very little underhand
work done.” Brewer ends his yam with a brand-new
and unexpected argument for the totalisator —it
“would go a long way to give the public more confi-
dence in owners and trainers.”
The morning papers and the evening ones
publish the same news in several daily editions. Fur-
ther, the news which appeared in the late editions
yesterday re-appears in the early ones to-day, and
may even be confirmed in more editions to-morrow.
So, when an aviator falls 150 ft. or 7000 ft., and hits
the earth so hard that he has no further use for him-
self, the fact is published so frequently that at last
it seems as if there were 800 of him, and his fall
had darkened the air. It comes as a surprise to hear,
on the authority of one of the aviation societies
which keeps a record of these things, that the total of
aeroplaning fatalities is still under 50.
Owing to the butchery of drivers and
onlookers, automobile road r racing was dropped in
Europe after the 1908 season. But a modification of
it continued to boom in Yankeedom, and recently
raised a blizzard of dust, human blood and public
indignation. Word comes now that France will re-
sume the gory business in 1912, owing to the French
trade having discovered that since its abolition the
sale of automobiles has fallen off a lot. Why the de-
cline should be attributed to the abolition of road-
racing is hard to say. In the automobile business,
thanks to men like the Marquis de Dion, France was for
quite a time the pioneer, and profited accordingly.
Then the other nations began to forge ahead, and,
naturally, the French foreign trade was the first to
suffer. But the French hold a different view, so the
Automobile Club will organise two great interna-
tional races, to take place on French soil, the com-
ing . year. A strong effort was made to restrict the
events to French cars, but it failed ; so all the motor-
ing world and his wife will be in France iri 1912.

Saturday was a shocking day on Sydney
Harbor, and the smaller craft had a beastly time of
it. In the Balmain Amateur Club’s handicap, no
less than 15 boats started, and, barring two, every
one was capsized, swamped, blown out of the water,
or knocked overboard. In the Cremorne Amateur
Club’s race, only one of four starters avoided turning
turtle. There was quite a number of narrow escapes
from drowning, at least one man being rescued only
in the nick of time. He had a real good view of
the Pearly Gates before he was brought round. On
Botany Bay things were impossible, and St. George
Club gave up the idea of racing, and took to drink,
or bowls, or something. Prince Alfred Yacht Club
blew off its race for the North-West Trophy, a £2O
event subscribed for by club members who reside in
the north-west part of N.S.W. Which would seem
to indicate that there is a phantom yacht club at
Bourke, or Walgett, or somewhere. Thelma (3min.)
was 30sec. late getting away, and was further delayed
by the splitting of the jib on the voyage, but shook
things up so that the beautifully-handled Rawhiti,
starting from scratch, won by only 34see. But public
interest was centred chiefly on the 18ft. final test, to
decide which boat should go to Westralia next
month. Five lined up, and got away to a wretched
start, Nimrod being the only one on the line when
the flag fell. It was not till three minutes later
that Acme bounded away in pursuit, and the rest
were anything from four to five minutes behind.
Still, it seems to have been the fault of the skippers
who were left. At the Lightship Acme had over-
taken Nimrod, in spite of the latter’s lucky and unoffi-
cial handicap, and looked a sure winner. “It’s all
over barring accidents!” said somebody, and as he
spoke the accident came along and burst Acme’s jib
right away. By the time it was made fast again, all
hope had apparently gone. Veteran Chris Webb
made a mighty effort in the Golding, and blew out,
for the day, an enormous spread of canvas. The
boat seemed to fairly spring out of the- water, and
began to cut down its opponents one by one till a
quick succession of vicious squalls blew over from
Shark Beach and tore sails and jib to ribbons,
and Golding had to drop out. But it was a mighty
game effort and possible only to such a past master
as Webb. Hereabouts Acme made another brilliant
effort, and although apparently out of it was sud-
denly seen to be closing on Nimrod very fast in-
deed. But the luck was right out, and the jib
again carrying away, Acme gave up the ghost. Nim-
rod narrowly escaped going in too close to Clarke
Island, and, after a hard battle round the triangle,
won from Sunny South by 2min. 25sec. This was
the third test, and Nimrod had won two, so to Wes-
tralia Nimrod shall go.

The Amateur Sporting Federation of N.
S. Wales, which is also the Olympic Council for that
section of the earth’s crust, has not covered itself
with glory in connection with the Olympiad. For
six long golden months it has bungled along and
made not the slightest known effort to finance a
strong N.S..W. representation. Now, when time is
running out, it cheerfully chucks the job on to
the shoulders of the swimming and rowing people,
seizes its portmanteau, and remarks that there’s just
time to catch the boat to the “conference” in Wel-
lington, Maoriland. It certainly does look as though
the time were ripe for the present crowd of A.S.F.
bosses to make way for better men.

Johnny Thompson, from America, got the
worst of a points’ decision on Saturday night at the
Stadium (Sydney) when he concluded his -20 rounds’
engagement with “Bandsman” Rice, of England. In
.-view of the insistence on the clean break this season
in Australia, it was hardly to be expected that he
would be able to do any more against the awkward
Englishman, unless some lucky chance came his way.
And Rice took all sorts of fine care that he (Rice)
would be no party to a deal with chance. From
gong to gong he kept his much heavier opponent at
good arm’s length, even if he had to run for it. As
a display of boxing it would have met with the
entire approval of the Evangelical Council. As an
exhibition of how to win on the points system, it
•met, with the approval of the referee —and he couldn’t
help himself.
Warren, of Melbourne, put up a remark-
able exhibition of gameness in his battle with Clarke,
a reputable Pacific Sloper (both list. IORb.), at
Melbourne Athletic Pavilion the other night. But
gameness in excess is not a thing a somewhat lame
and limp boxer can always be congratulated on.
Thus, if Warren hadn’t been so game he would have
been saved much damage, and results would have been
the same. As it was, Clarke couldn’t finish him in
20 rounds, whereas the finish might reasonably have
been called in the 10th. The local lad was handi-
capped with a crippled duke. He did fairly well
with his right for a time, but Clarke was all over
him, like a swarm of bees, and was a hundred-to-one
winner on points when the gong signalled a happy
ending.

The roving Kangaroos crept out of the
second football test at Edinburgh on Saturday last,
with a draw of 11 points each. But there was balm
in Gilead in the thought that the Kangaroos had won
the first test earlier in the year, so it is our father
Bull who is feeling worried over the matter.

The black pug. has been giving the white
man a bad time of it lately, and a rather prolonged
lately at that. On Boxing Day, the white man can
sit back in comfort at the Mclnstoush Stadium, Rush-
cutter’s Bay, Sydney, and watch the black race knock-
ing itself to pieces; for on that delightful occasion
Sam McVea and Samuel Langford, both colored
brethren, alleged to have been made by Providence in
His own image, will get busy on one another at 10
a.m. sharp. The doors will be open at 6 a.m., so
the fight-fan will have ample time to stow himself
into a good seat to watch the fun.
Lily Elsie, the beauteous original Merry Widow-
in the English version of that German opera, is about
to marry a widower named Bullough. With a view,
perhaps, to showing her what she had to beat in
competitive examination, one of the London weeklies
published her portrait beside that of Mr. Bullough’s
first wife.
Adelaide woke up, the other morning, and
found a cow-tending youth lying electro-
cuted in a suburban road: and the subse-
quent inquest found the Tramways Trust,
the Power Supply Co., the Electric Light-
ing Co. all eager to show that it wasn't their
fault. They set out among them that (1)
the wire was not naturally a live one. and
should hang well clear of another that was,
but somehow the two had touched; and (2)
it was not within reasonable reach from the
ground, but boys used to haul it down with
something heavy, hang on to it, and get mild
shocks. It happened that there had been a
shower just before the cow-minder happened
along, and the wetness established a more
■ complete circuit, so the trick suddenly
turned fatal. In the circumstances, nobody
in particular was blamed; but the coroner
dropped a hint to the public not to fool with
anything strange these times, so many
things being loaded nowadays.
GREAT WOMAN’S REMEDY.
WEAKNESS AND POOR BLOOD
CAUSED MUCH SUFFERING, FROM
GIRLHOOD TO WOMANHOOD.
SYDNEY WOMAN’S STORY.
In the case of Mrs. Martha Simmons, of
49 Cove Street, Balmain, Sydney, whose let-
ter appears below, another illustration is
given of the wonderful properties of Dr.
Mrs. Martha Simmons.
(From a photo.)
Morse’s Indian Root
Pills as a Great Wo-
man’s Remedy. Bilious
attacks and weakness
generally in her case
were but the symptoms
of other complaints pe-
culiar to woman. Many
women have found in Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills
just the same effective
remedy that Mrs. Sim-
mons did, who says in her
last letter: —
“In my teens I suf-
fered very badly from
Bilious Attacks. My
blood was very poor, my
whole system became
completely run down,
and on many occasions I
was so weak that I had
to be supported home by my schoolmates.
As I grew older I did not seem to overcome
my weakness, and I was in this state of
health for a long time. Periodical head-
aches, bilious attacks and constipation
were my constant ailments. I gave many
medicines a fair trial, but I did not receive
any permanent relief. The salvation of my
life was Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills; it
was wonderful how they relieved me of
bilious attacks. They put life into my
body, regulated my system, and I gradually
grew stronger, until I became a perfectly
healthy woman. I still use Dr. Morse s
Indian Root Pills occasionally, and heartily
recommend them to everybody. You may
use this testimonial just as you like for pub-
lication.”

“Mix”: All the world loves a murder, and
is loath to forget the grim details of it.
Thus M.L. still gratefully remembers the
case of Ellis. He slew a citizen who had
dragged off his clothes and shown the crowd
the marks of a flogging inflicted on him
years before, and was duly hanged. Pre-
vious to his suspension he placed in the
hands of Tom Wilford, M.P., his counsel, a
sealed letter, with directions that it was to
be opened on Wilford’s death. Maoriland
yearns to know the contents of that docu-
ment, and thus it came about that the en-
tire Bar nodded understandingly the other
day, when Plugger Alf, perusing the bul-
letin of Wilford's recent bout with appendi-
citis, flung down the paper and howled
furiously “Blast it, he’s getting better V'
The attitude of these good folks was not due
to the fact that they loved Wilford little.
Simply, they loved sensationalism more.
And yet it may be that Ellis was a humor-
ist, and enclosed a blank sheet of paper or
the photo of a ballet girl in the envelope he
gave to Wilford.

“Harrison 0” : A human curio, which should be of
interest to students of the bizarre, is Prince de Chab-
ran, the cynical aristocratic ruin of “Dame Nature.”
The torpid nobleman is purchased as husband by a
wealthy lady, who desires a title. When she con-
ceives an affection for a young academician, and
wishes to marry him, she offers the blue-blooded in-
cubus £20,000~ for her freedom, asking that a cer-
tain painting, to which she has taken a fancy, should
be thrown in as discount. The picture represents a
ladj' whom the ancient knew in his hot and passion-
ate youth, but although desirous of the pelf, and not
adverse to a divorce from his arrogant purchaser, he
announces that the portrait is not for sale. The Prin-
cess offers an extra £5OOO for the work of art, but
the lofty patriarch stands upon his absurd last legs,
and observes that it is one of three pictures of former
odalisques with which he will not part for unlimited
lucre. Even though his blood has turned to absinthe,
and he wears the' wizened physiognomy of eld. He
tells his spouse: “You have bought this ruined old
shell of an aristocrat, but you oannot buy his soul.’
He wants the Flossies, preserved in oils, to snnle
down on him when he surrenders the ghost, and he
refuses, even to the bitter end, to be segregated from
the painting.
“Parisine”: Paris is rushing a five-act version of
“Pickwick” just now. The characters of Pickwick,
Mrs. Bardell, Jingle, Sam Weller, the Fat Boy,
Wardle, and Dodson and Fogg are particularly well
done. Mrs. Bardell is etlierialised into a sort of
Delilah, and the plavwright condemns Pickwick to
marry her at the finish. Which reminds one that
London rumor credits Herbert Tree with the inten-
tion of putting in a “David Copperfield” adaptation,
in order that he may play Micawber. It should be
a striking contrast to his Colonel New-come. In
Melbourne, half a century ago, G. F. Rowe produced
his original adaptations of “Copperfield” and Barn-
aby Budge,” His Micawber was first-rate, Har-
wood burlesqued the part, when Sam Emery ap-
peared as Peggotty. Jennie Lee’s Jo has a kind of
immortality. She" was supported in Melbourne by
Eloise Juno, Maggie Knight, Lillie Bryer, Harwood,
Hoskins, O'Brien, W. B. Warner, Jack Brvan,
Daniels and Burnett. Yet Beatrice Holloway, with
the tears in her beautiful voice, has given Jo with
a pathos that Jennie Lee could not reach.
“Henry H.”: Recent revivals of “The Sign of the
Cross” and “Foilis XI,” make this a suitable time
for entering a protest. For some reason or another
one of these famous personages is generally shown on
the stage as a broken-down, broken-up epileptic, and
the other as a sour and aged ruin. Nero was a
fine, upstanding Roman of 31 when he handed in
his earthly resignation, after keeping the empire
awake during a reign of 14 years, being thrice married,
and building a city. Louis XI. was a strenuous
and polished French gentleman of. 60 when he died
(six years younger than George Reid is now) ; and it
he wasn’t married three times, he. a-t least founded
three Universities. Compared with Elizabeth of
England, who died at the age of 70, and at 63 be-
headed her latest “mash,” an infuriated wine mer-
chant, aged 34, these two men should be shown on
the stage as comparatively youthful gallants.
“Searcher”: “0.K.” (B. IG/11/’11) calls “Travi-
ata” “a cheap and tawdry old thing.’ Traviata
was written by a genius who wrote opera for singers,
which is more than can be said of any of the modern
writers, including Puccini. To make them effective,
“Samson and Delilah,” “Tosca” and Gutter-
fly” do not require good s risers, but actors. Wag-
ner mostly requires roarers rather than either, V erdi
must have fine singers ; the pity is, he seldom gets
them. Every note which Verdi wrote to a word had
its meaning; but the word requires sometning more
than distinct enunciation and mere beauty of tone
to reveal this meaning. What the Argus the other
day called “the old-fashioned bel-canto of the
Italian school” is wanted no longer—it is not under-
stood. There are few exponents of the bel-canto,
there are few teachers of it. There is no call for
it The highest form of the divinest of arts is practi-
cally dead. Of the present opera co., Scandiam
alone has it; he showed it in “Traviata. His
pleading with Violetta, his dignified sternness with
bis son— he did, in fact was truly
drawn and colored.
“Jimmy Glover—His Book” is the latest volume of
Poverty Point reminiscences. Jimmy has long been
conductor of the orchestra at Drury Lane, and is as
well known in London as the pump of that parish.
He has some interesting things to say about Dan
Leno for years the funniest man in the music halls,
and the chief humorist in Drury Lane Christmas
pantomimes—in one of which, by the wav, he had
to fight a: mock duel with Australia s Nellie Stewart.
Glover says Leno has no “initiative sense of humor.
All his corilic scenes had to be built up for him.
And yet he could command £250 a week at the
halls. Its - wSTSandrinffham that ruined him in the
end The "Prince of Wales (afterwards King Ed.)
honored him with a command performance. Dan
was the first music hall performer so favored, and it
turned his brain. He had to be placed in a private
retreat, and died soon after emerging therefrom.
At latest, the London Hippodrome’s weekly salary
list was reported to be £2BOO. Leoncavallo, conducting
a condensed version of his opera “Pagliacci,” and
Madame Rejane, in French improprieties, pocket most
of the receipts. Close by, at the Coliseum, the rival
house, the salary-list must be even more tremendous,
with Sarah Bernhardt, Cissie Lipton and Albert
Chevalier topping the bill. But both houses are of
enormous holding capacity, and are crowded twice a
day ; so, : in spite of the huge expenditure, they are
able to earn good dividends.
In a revival of “Man and Superman,” at the Lon-
don Cri., our old friend, Edmund Gwenn, sat behind
the motor goggles of ’Enery Straker, and made a
great success of the part. A couple of others ap-
pearing in the play were Robert Loraine, the ac-
complished aviating mummer, and Pauline Chase,
the representative Peter Pan. Pauline was cast
for the character of Ann Whitefield, and, though she
had the right name for the man-hunting Ann, she
had the wrong temperament, and consequently her
man-hunt was less convincing than it might have
been.
Australia ought to look out for * Ilis Heart in
Japan ” a new four-act melodrama having a run in
London. The hero and his pals are all British
bluejackets, and the villains are all Japanese—quite
contrary to recent British custom.
“C. Ockney”: “Pittite” on the logical finish versus
the “happy endihg” of plays (B. 5/10/ 11), is inter-
esting, if not convincing. Pinero, even at the
“Profligate” period, was a strong man, but the play
was flabby in the last act, else there could have
arisen no' question, of altering the end. There never
is with the perfectly-balanced article. When a
play wabbles at .the finish, the author has missed
the ’bus, and no amount of tinkering can save
his work. As Edmund Gosse, the literary critic, put
it in a recent article, “the public has. np pycqon ;
ceived views on what it likes, but waits to be
persuaded by the genius of any gifted writer.
That is so true that, when I hear of any play being
submitted to “alterations and repairs,” in defer-
ence to “public taste,” I wink the other eye,
and look soon for the logical end —the end of the
run!
“C. Ockney”: Actors are proverbially bad judges
of an unproduced play, which is hardly surprising.
“Is there a good part for me in it?” is the one
question in the mind of the mummer. If there is,
his belief in the piece is enormous; if there isnit,
well, how can he help being pessimistic about its
chances ? George Edwardes, in London Daily Mail,
relates that he sold Alfred Cellier’s “Dorothy for
£lOOO, to his accountant, principally because he met
George Grossmith in the Strand one day, and was
told by that mime that Gilbert and Sullivan’s Ruddi-
gore,” then in rehearsal at the Savoy, with G. G. in
the principal comedy part, would prove the best
comic opera ever produced at the theatre. If his
information is right,” said Edwardes, “what chance
has ‘Dorothy’ ” ? Grossmith’s tip was, of course, a
wrong ’un. “Ruddigore” proved the least successful |
of the Savoy operas, and Edwardes let a fortune slip j
through his fingers, for “Dorothy” made £lOO,OOO
for his accountant!
The bedroom play is still raging in Paris. At the
Theatre Michel they were doing the two-act piece,
“Pour Etre du Club,” one scene whereof is laid in a
lady’s sleeping apartment. A critic skated over the
thin ice in this way of speaking: “Mile. Juliette
Clarens and Lucien Rozenberg occupied the place of
honor on the programme, and just the reverse in the
bedroom.”
Old Australian playgoers will remember George
Coppin in “Milky White,” one of his favorite parts.
The piece was written by H. D. Craven, whose son
Tom is now playing a condensed version of it at the
Tivoli, London. Tom has recliristened it “The
Dairyman,” and has given the venerable comedy a
new lease of life.
Oswald Stoll, native of Melbourne, is one of Lon-
don’s most enterprising citizens. He is managing
director of the Coliseum and a score of other variety
palaces.” The Coliseum is his London head-
quarters, but not far away, in Drury Lane, he will
presently be directing yet another “palace,” built by
the Coliseum architect on the site of the demolished
“Morgue,” or Middlesex Music Hall. This site, it is
claimed, is the oldest in London continuously used
for entertainment purposes. Records of nearly three
centuries ago show that at the “Morgue’s Head, in
Drury Lane,” bear-baiting, cock-fighting, rat-catch-
ing, and various other gentle pastimes were regularly
carried on.
“J.F.H.”: There are signs of a resuscitation of the
cmce-famous semi-circle of burned-cork singers and
instrumentalists, with bones and tambourines at the
oorners and the dignified interlocutor in the centre.
A negro minstrel interlude on the old lines has been
introduced into the latest ballet, “New York, at the
London Empire, and is proving one of its most popu-
lar features; and at the other variety houses the old
business is coming more and more into prominence.
“Vic.”: Last year there' were some Yiddish
dramatic performances in the Melbourne Temperance
Hall under the direction of Weisberg, an actor and
manager from New York. They caught on so re-
markably, and the local actors and actresses were
so good, that Weisberg was encouraged to go forward,
lie imported Mr., Mrs. and Miss Finkelstein from
New York, all excellent performers, and so put more
backbone into the local co. The new season s per-
formances are given in the theatre of the turn
Verein, where Gregan McMahon’s company has ap-
peared Weisberg is an excellent low comedian, and
can do a bit of tragedy in the Robson vein ; Finkel-
stein is leading man, just the cut for something like
Ishmael, in “The Flowers of the forest ; Mrs.
Finkelstein is the Celeste of the troupe; and Miss
Finkelstein is the inggnue, with a good turn, for the
pathetic. There is rght-down grit in the acting, and
the Turn Verein Germain crowd say that Weisberg
and co. ought to show at the Princess’s. No doubt
something of the sort will come.
“Billy T.”: Saw a very delightful, if somewhat
bulky, foreign grand opera artiste of great import-
ance standing on a penny-in-the-slot machine on a
Melbourne railway platform. She was gravely and
reproachfully scanning the tell-tale face of the
machine, which registered a trifle over 14st. The
tremendous cantatrice was slow to understand, and
when she did she broke into a tragic wail, stamped
her foot, and cried: “Liar ! t Eet ees. Liar .
k lA “Bookware” : Ope of the most immortal of characters
was invented by a man for. a comedy which is as
utterly forgotten as he is himself. Thomas Morton
was the man, and he invented Mrs. Grundy for a
comedy named “Speed the Plough,” produced very
early in the 19th century. Mrs. Grundy did not
appear, but Farmer Ashfield’s wife was always talk-
ing about the great lady—“ What will Mrs. Grundy
say?” Dickens took the hint for Mrs. Arris m
“Martin Chuzzlewit.” Since then, many, another has
played this very successful trick of making the prin-
cipal character one who does not appear. thus,
Mdlle. Duclos is the very keystone in Adrienne
Lecouvreur,” acted here by Bernhardt and by Beere.
“Harrison O.”: He is a popular conductor, whose
name is made up of, two syllables, and a sneeze, and
he was trying hard to get a pizzicato passage as it
was scored. He struck his stand sharply with his baton
and addressed the orchestra. “For God s sake don t
hic-cough it,” he implored; “play it like gentle-
men.”
“Blue Mask”: Miss Eva Balfour, is a M.L. girl
who is prepared to take her affidavit that it is not
so difficult for a stranger to reach the London
footlights as other strangers relate. Three years
ago she arrived in London, stage-struck, but with"
out any experience; found her way to Herbert
Tree’s office without an introduction, and was
promptly given an understudyship. Since then, she
has gradually climbed until Tree cast her as Queen
of the Witches (a part, by the way, which has
alwavs, hitherto, been played by a man) in his re-
cent’revival of “Macbeth.” The. young lady was
born in Canterbury (M.L.), and is as beautiful as
some of the girls O. A. Jeffries handed over to the
“Shepherd Kings.”
THE STRIKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In connection with the Australian Actors’ Union
(affiliated with the Council) there is a pro-
posal to build a union theatre. There are magnificent
possibilities in all this.
The night was dark, the street was lone,
The theatre rose, black and grim ;
An actor perched upon a stone;
I spoke a friendly word to him.
“No play,” he said; “you may begone,
In very truth a strike is on.”
“A strike? Are you a picket, then?”
Ilis answer came, with anger quick :
“Ho, fellow, darest insinuate,
That I, Anstruther, am a stick?
No, no, the actors do not buck —
It was the audiences struck.
“They have gone out for better plays,
And better players, too. But, peace.
In these degenerate later days
We cast our pearls before the geese.
In quest of justice we resort
To Higgins’ Arbitration Court.”

BOXING BY POST.
(Vide “Snowy” Baker’s advertisement.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I tried hard to learn boxing a few years ago,
And a battered professor instructed me;
Though l took the first lessons all right from that
pro.,
Through the full course he never conducted ipe.
Oh, the jolts in the ribs and the jabs on the nose!
In each bout I seemed all the time copping ’em ;
And the pro., when half-dead from the floor I arose,
Would abuse me no end for not stopping ’em !
I was never without a black eye or thick ear,
But I can’t say the game quite appealed to me ;
Though I read a big book on the “Art,” it seemed
clear
That the book would remain ever sealed: to me.
So I sacked the professor. He called, me a “muff” ;
And a straight left at parting he handed me.
I remember I thought, and I said; "fj uan tum stiff,.
As I beef-steaked the bruise where he’d landed me.
But I’ll give him a straight left one day, I will bet,.
For it’s only a question of training it,
Just “a bit of'my own back,” Ifm longing to get,
And I’m now in the way of obtaining it.
For the up-to-date “Snowy” has thought: out a plan,
And to good account soon I’ll; be turning it,
“I teach boxing by post,!’ runs his ad. Bless the
man —
That’s the way that Ii much prefer learning it l

WHAT FAMOUS DOCTORS SAY OF
antineurasthin
THE NEW NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD.
Dr. GUISEPPE LAPONNI (Physician-in-Ordinary
to His Holiness Pope Pius X.) wrote:—
“ ‘Antineurasthin’... is an admirable agent for
toning and strengthening the Nervous System. I
shall not fail to recommend it to my colleagues.”
Dr. ZAMARA (Physician to the Bad Hofgastein
Health Resort) wrote, after making a careful analy-
sis and subjecting “Antineurasthin” to exhaustive
personal tests: “In proportion as mankind is weaned
from the use of Nerve-destroying drugs, and devote
their attention to your healthy Nerve Food, they will
be cured of Nervousness.”
Dr. LION, the Director of the Russian State Hos-
pital for Epileptics at St. Petersburg, reports magi-
cal results obtained from trials made exclusively
with “Antineurasthin” on Nerve Sufferers. An im-
mediate and marked increase in mental vigor and
bodily strength; increased appetite and sleep—re-
moval of constipation and tendency to tire rapidly of
work; calmness and marked increase in self-confi-
dence, etc.

For over half a century Alcock’s Billiard Tables have been the
recognised standard of perfection in Billiard Tables. Lindrum,
Gray and other champion players of world-wide repute are quick
to express their appreciation of these excellent tables, for they
realise that, for accuracy, precision, speed and pleasurable play
there is no table in the world to equal them. In fact, it is on the
“ALCOCK” Table that both Lindrum and Gray won their way to
the front.

There is a small * chasm in the middle of that table;
and the material to fill it up isn’t available. The
reserves shown in the last line are made up as fol-
lows: Sinking fund, £23,416; formal reserve fund,
£8359; less revenue account debit, £lB4. The
sinking fund is very properly credited with its own
interest earnings. The reserve fund appears to be
partly a renewal reserve; as shown above, various
amounts, as they are spent on works, are written off
this account. Various renewals are also paid for out
of ordinary revenue; so between the two the pro-
vision made to cover general depreciation looks satis-
factory. The total amount of loans outstanding is
£160,000. To the sinking fund an annual contribu-
tion of 1 p.c. is made; interest earnings last year
were £7OO ; total addition to the fund, £2300, as
shown above. The gross profit (i.e., before providing
for interest and sinking fund) was £7 6s. 3d. p.c.
After paying interest, and providing for sinking-
fund, there should be a fair margin there to provide
for general depreciation and contingencies. The
business continues to grow steadily, and the average
charge for light and power continues to diminish.
This gives the history of the past few years:—
Units Sold. Average Price.
1905 .. .. 793,306 .. 4'46d.
1906 .. .. 994,523 .. 3'B6d.
1907 .. .. 1,308,880 .. 3Tld.
1908 .. .. 1,533,286 .. 2’7Bd.
1909 _ _
1910 .. .. 1,692,859 .. 2‘36d.
1911 .. .. 1,763,425 .. 2-34 d.
The average price is extremely low ; this is partly
due to the fact that Launceston has cheap water power
for generating its electricity, and partly to the other
big fact that the consumers get the whole benefit of
that cheapness, there being no shareholders to feed
with dividends.
The Belambangan was another of the syn-
dicates formed in Sydney and Melbourne to find out
whether “the East” would provide another Tongkah.
The vague El Dorado over which the co. had an
option w r as in Sumatra, and, as already reported,
Horton and Freeman, the Sydney mining engineers
who went to look at it, turned it down with a most
conclusive bang. Thev now report: “Gold mines
certainly exist and will slowly continue to be dis-
covered and opened up in Sumatra and Borneo. All
the properties offered for sale, however, are quite
virgin and unprospected, nor will the Dutch people
undertake that kind of work, so that mining invest-
ors entering the Dutch Indies must be prepared to
do their own prospecting; entailing a much greater
expense of time and money than Australian mining
investors usually feel justified in affording.” The
little the Belambangan did absorbed all but £156 of
the co.’s modest capital; and that unconsidered trifle
is being dropped into a stocking to wait until some-
thing turns up.
* * * *
News comes from the West that the Labor
Government is determined to enforce the language
test among foreigners in mines—which means the
weeding out of new-chum Dagoes, who, working
among high explosives, are a danger to themselves
and everybody else, because of their inability to make
themselves understood.
One of the shortest reports on record was
made a while ago by a Victorian mines inspector.
He was an assistant then, and his chief was away,
and he was asked to inspect and pass some new
machinery, as the people wanted to get a move on
quickly. He investigated the outfit, and passed it;
but when the High Panjandrum returned he “went
off” about such an unhallowed usurpation of what he
considered his rights, and in his official rage for-
warded a protest to headquarters, complaining that
his understudy had done the business in a most in-
competent manner inasmuch as the cooling water
tank of the oil engine was close behind the cylinder,
thereby preventing the taking out of the piston, if
desired. The department, as well versed in the
internal economy of an oil engine as its inspector,
forwarded a stiff type-written epistle to the offender,
calling on him for a full report as to why he had so
incompetently erred in regard to the engine. In re-
turn, the understudy, who fortunately knew an oil
engine from a cow, dipped his pen in red ink, and
wrote across the document: “Tell the blanky fool the
piston comes out at the front end of the cylinder.”
The understudy is now a chief inspector himself, but
from that day to this neither the Panjandrum nor
the department has ever mentioned the matter of the
oil engine in his hearing.
* * * #
Some tall estimates have been made of the
gold that is still left in the Rand mines, but the one’
just arrived at by the S’African Union’s Minister of
Finance beats them all. His figures are
£2,000,000,000, which, on an output of £40,000,000
a year, gives a life of 50 years. Yet, even that is
reckoned by some wild, whooping optimists to be an
under-estimate. “Simply appalling” is how the
Financial Times man at Jewburg describes the way
phthisis is killing and disabling the miners who are
employed digging out this wealth. The Government
mining engineer is quoted to show that the workers
are being encouraged to die off rapidly, and he
alleges that everyone who goes underground gets
phthisis if he stays there long enough. Some men,
he says, are only slightly affected; others are on the
brink of disablement, but continue working. One
Wybergh, who was Commissioner of Mines under
Milner, is credited with the statement that 25 p.c.
of the miners are incurably affected, and that the
question ought to be settled whether it is advisable
to carry on an industry in a manner which murders
its men. Wybergh declares that the present
methods are wasteful of money as well as of life, be-
cause men die off in great numbers as soon as they
become efficient. He would, therefore, put the whole
cost of compensation and remedial measures on the
owners.


To Intending Piano Buyers.
Here is a piece of trade information, from the best authority
in London, which ought to be of interest to the general public.
EXTRACT FROM “MUSICAL OPINION AND MUSIC
REVIEW,” LONDON, NOVEMBER, 1911.
“Pianos sold in England for TWENTY=EIGHT GUINEAS
“ (at twelve and sixpence per month) readily bring EIGHTY^
“ FIVE guineas in Australia on time=payment (usually five
“to ten pounds deposit and twenty to fifty shillings
“ monthly). They are often paid within a year (or SEVENTY-
“ FIVE guineas cash). Somewhat lower prices prevail in
“ the larger cities. There is a growing tendency to support
“ English goods in the Colonies, so the sooner the English
“ piano manufacturer discovers that his wealthiest buyers
“ are not living in Great Britain the better.”
4■, » ' v ' v '
•i' '-“IV ■. *
Statements of the same kind often appear in the German and English music-
trade papers. The exorbitant profits made by middlemen in Australia explain
their rooted objection to manufacturing locally, for they would find themselves
compelled to turn out a far better article made in Australia, and at a materially
higher cost.

Captain Trot: The snow-banks of Canada
are a long way off, and only of limited interest....
Concrete: Too far off our beat J.F.C.: Joke evi-
dently melted out in the post W.A.T.: Grieved to
hear that the curator’s horse wanders by night all
over the flower beds; but even if the horse were a
centipede, the damage wouldn’t be worth half a
column... .Thomas Rice: Both serials have been
published in novel form, at 3s. 6d., with postage
added. Apply any local bookseller, or George Rob-
ertson, Sydney.... Buck : Long-buried post-hole story
to hand, which is proof that you can raise the dead.
AH the same, you won't raise it in this paper....
D.O’D.: All as unprofitable as a widow's husband...
Don Q. (and several hundred others) : Write prooer
names plainly, and save yourself and other people
unnecessary trouble. .. .Arundel: In consideration of
your affidavit that it is Very true, we’ll print as much
of it as the public deserves for sixpence:—
ON A SHEEP STATION.
Here I sit and dream alone, fretting to the marrow
bo-ne,
My heart it feels like iron stone, there’s weariness
in every bone.
Week in, week out, it’s all the same—just the real
monotonous game.
Wool here, wool there, wool every-where, in fact you
smell it in the air.
\ou drive the sheep into the yard and work there
you must.
Just curse, and yell, and jump about, and nearly
choke with dust..
You mount a horse which is quiet of course, until
you climb on high,
Then you have either got to hang like hell, or go
unto the sky.
But what is the use of fretting for that will never
pay,
For there’s always a day in store for us a day that
will come our way.
So let us think of the brightest and let us hope for
the best,
And if there’s a day in store for us God knows it’s a
much needed rest.
.... G. Schroder: Letter received. Many thanks for
good wishes.... Tiaki: The tuppence short gag may
be a fact known to you, but we can’t use it, because
the copyright still belongs to the descendants of
Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, who originated it at
smoke-o one day when the walls of Jerusalem were
being shored up.... The Recording Angel: Don’t
know author; can’t ’ republish J.V.McG.: Same
remark applies to your ancient pup yarn.... Snowy:
Several laymen have served in the office of Attorney-
General. Peake, for instance, was Price’s Attorney-
General in S. Aus. ; and the only use Peake ever had
for horsehair was for stuffing his horse-collars and
cart-saddles. .. .8.E.: In your attack on the mono-
rail, you reply to a heap of arguments which this
paper, at all events, never used. (1) The Bulle-
tin never professed that the use of one rail instead
of two would “halve 1 the cost of construction.” But
there might be a very large saving through the use
of shorter sleepers—in these days of timber shortage
a suitable long sleeper is much harder to get than a
short one. Also, the Brennan train is alleged to be
able to tackle steep grades and abrupt curves that
the ordinary two-rail concern can’t look at. That
means some saving in construction. (2) There are
prospects of a great increase in speed. That means
reduction of weight. If what is now a day-and-night
journey is turned into a day journey, the bulky sleep-
ing car can be left behind. Also, the rolling-stock
can do double service. It will wear out faster, but
that will save it from being scrapped as out of date
before it is worn out. (3) You say that the adop-
tion of the mono-rail will involve an expensive scrap-
ping or a costly re-construction of existing rolling-
stock. Well, Australia has now five different gauges.
It is clamoring for uniformity. Any kind of uni-
formity involves a huge and costly work of recon-
struction. In any case, the blessed old rolling-stock
would soon wear out in any case. It isn’t immortal.
Ann a lot of it is on its last legs even n0w....
D.X.G.: Can’t say. Had three rounds with the pro-
blem, and then skied the belated wipe of inquiry.
Adam B.: “Ha’penny’s” swindle isn’t worth more
than a paragraph Abulk (or something like
that) : Interesting article about the possible preser-
vation of Binghi, but a great lack of information as
to the probable value of Binghi after he is pre-
served. Is there any moral or economic law which
calls on anybody to make special efforts to multiply
a race that seems to have no future? If it is true
that the soul is eternal and indestructible, then the
inference is that if Binghi isn’t born, the soul that
might have been Binghi will be somebody else. If
he will gain by being somebody else, with a different
brain, and the white man seems to think he will,
why lament because he isn’t Binghi? .Just consider
that it may have been the decrease of the Australian
aboriginal" race that saved Gladstone, Gambetta,
Garibaldi, Cavour, Diaz, George Washington, Simon
Bolivar, Charles Dickens, Taine, Pinero and other
prominent men from being King Billies. . . .Yuba M.:
This is the 20,000 th time that yam has turned up.
....George Washington: Regret to say that we don’t
believe your yellow box yarn. It looks like an ex-
aggregation of an Ananias or something. ... Tracker:
Your biography of the bloke who writes the answers
to correspondents is too true to print. This bloke
knows, because lie’s part of the bloke. . . .L.E.A. or
L.E.S. or L.E.T. or something: Quite agree with,
what we can read of your letter, which amounts to
the date P. G. Jackson: Victoria Constant
Subscriber (M.L.): Remote chance, but the compli-
cations are worthy of an unemployed lawyer.... A
Subscriber: If beauty could be defined, might tackle
the other questions. .. .A.8.C.: Can’t say without
knowing by-laws, locality and several other things.
Local bodies have power to charge extra for special
services, if necessary, but unable to say from your
letter whether it was necessary in this case.... Bo-
swell : As it happened the other man arrived before
you. When a dozen or 40 people rush along the
same item of information they can’t all appear. It
would make the public tired... .Nix: Tablet par. is
just about a year old, which is much worse than if
you had sent it in 10,000,013 years hence.... Dan
Lloyd : Declined with infinite gusto.... Stingaree:
Meal sign as old as the promise woman never keeps.
. ...Toomuc: Don’t know the meaning of the word
“Toomuc,” and, so far, have struggled along and
got an occasional meal without the information. If
we find our luck giving out, however, will assume
that ignorance of “toomuc” is the cause, and will
flee like mad in search of knowledge. .. .J. Mollier :
Can’t do it; Bulloeky Bill’s best team couldn’t drag
out of us the name or whereabouts of any contri-
butor.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
R.P.: Drawing of the profoundly blotted order of
architecture, and the gag doesn’t* excite even the lOud
guffaw which expounds the unfurnished cranium
Fitz: They are not exactlv screamers in point of
mirth. Nor are they exactlv howlers. They are be-
twixt and between. . . .W.: The picture is not at all
after the manner of Raphael, and the man who knew
three languages is a very far-back circumstance....
L.M.: If that crude boy in your picture hangs on
much longer to' the dishevelled coat-tail of the
shapeless old man, the very sketchy old man will
either have no disordered coat-tail left, or he will
fall back like thunder on the untidy boy... .B. Ford:
Quite unfit. The scratchy background in most of the
pictures is almost black, and the figures, which are
just about as black as the background, suggest inky
ghosts against a wall of turtle soup....J. Yates:
You are the only artist we know who can draw a
wall in such a fashion that it might be a wall or it
might be a dog. And if you happen to want a wall
that can bark at night, the arrangement is valuable.
....Will D.: Unsuitable picture, dealing with an
extinct or imaginary animal —to wit. the servant
girl.... W.W.F.: The axe and woodheap joke is
having a rest this warm weather. .. .L.F.: It looks
too—too much —like a copy of imitation from the
French.... F.M.N,: The hanged dog looks —(I) hor-
ribly human; (2) libellously like a well-known poli-
tician hereabouts. .. .Lance M.: Have you suddenly
wakened up to the existence of the Anglo-Jappy
treaty? It has been in existence quite a long while.
.. . . A.P.C.: Simple little jest of the kind that must
have been made 2000 times or more. .. .An Obscure
Artist: Do you really think that the bush horseman
looks like that? Well, he doesn’t- —nor does his
horse. Your sketch suggests a mad bottle-oh riding
on a giraffe.
“8.J.”; In the Combine’s “Sinbad the Sailor”
panto, in Melbourne, the part of Sinbad will not as
is usually the case, be taken by a female but instead
will be appropriated by Frank Lincoln the energetic
young man who appeared as the Scotch hero in “The
Gay Gordons.” However, the community will not be
entirely deprived of its “principal boy ” Miss Florence
lmeson (also of the moderately “Gay Gordons”) will
appear as Hinbad, and wear tights or words to that
effect.

sn Dl w a T i r V' li ?, gton ’ on December 13, aged
00, \V. J. B. Gray, a Darling Downs pio-
neer- He went to Queensland in 1842, and
laid lived on the Downs since 1843. Some
time ago he wrote a short history of “Early
Days on the Downs,” in which he alleged
thal explorer Allan Cunningham was not
the first Whiteman to see the tableland, but
that one Baker, who lived with the blacks
tor many years, and subsequently returned
to civilisation, roamed over tho.se parts long
beiore the professional investigator came
that way.
Dapper little Sergeant-Major J. P. Byrne
who has presided at the front door of the
Queensland Legislative Assembly since the
dim and misty long ago, and who still intro-
duces visitors to the members in the time-
honored way, is publishing an enlarged edi-
tion of his brochure, “First Lessons on Rifle
Shooting. Of the early edition, Lord Rob-
eits wrote: It should be in the hands of
every cadet ; and the author is proud
enough of the opinion to reproduce it, and to
dedicate the second impression of his work
to the ancient Field-Marshal. Referring to the
question of judging distances, the author
instances the accuracy of the Boers. By
'vay ot explanation, he alleges that, as a
matter of training, the Boer boys were given
a couple of rounds of ammunition and told
to bring the week’s supply of meat in..
I ailure ensured a flogging. Unfortunately,
the only wdd meat in Australia is in the
Meat Ring, and that is preserved by State
One of Digby Denham’s Ministers had
the nerve to tell his fellow legislators, the
other day, that “representative government
in the Australian States was on its trial.”
lie might have added, also, but didn’t, that
so long as Fat has an Upper House, the
jury box is packed.
Multitudinous fines having utterly failed
to check the adulterating milk-vendors of
.Brisbane, the resigned public now merely
implores these gentlemen to kindly cease
from sophisticating their milk with filthy
water. Any milkman who will guarantee
tfiat he only adulterates with pure distilled
water would probably scoop in a large circle
ot delighted customers.
“Xela”: “A.Y.A.” (B. 7/12/’ll) was
seeing not merely double, but seventy times
seven .when he saw “thousands of sheep in
the Burnett district.” I know the Burnett
pretty well, and the only sheep there now
are a few ration mobs of 100 or so. These
are run in small paddocks near the home-
steads, and generally a gin is told off to
shepherd them. They are yarded every
night m a dog-proof yard. About five year's
ago several sheep-men, who knew their busi-
ness in the south, took up land in the Degilbo
AT THE PICNIC.

Id led a better life!”
district, and, in. spite of the warnings of the
older settlers, went in for sheep-farming
and lamb-raising. To a man those settlers
are now dairying. Worms, dingoes and
spear-grass just about broke their hearts and
their banking accounts. I grant “A.Y.A.”
that the Burnett is flourishing, but it is not
on sheep—it is on plain, common or garden
cow. In witness whereof, I produce the
two up-to-date butter factories just erected,
one at Gayndah and the other at Biggenden.
■‘Jack A’Randa”: The Queensland Em-
ployers’ Federation has been bursting its
collar-stud in a well-sustained effort to have
union secretaries and old ex-workers de-
clared ineligible as employees’ representa-
tives on Wages Boards. The result is that
the Amending Bill introduced by the Gov-
ernment contains a clause debarring every
person not actively engaged in an industry
from sitting as a Board representative for
that industry. This, if passed, will mean
that employees in the industry will have to
sit on the Boards beside the bosses with the
sack staring them in the face, and Private
Enterprise anticipates much benefit thereby.
Unfortunately for P.E., a few supporters
of the butter-box Government have shown
themselves hostile to the unlovely proposal,
and Denham knows a hot brick when he
lifts it as well as the next office limpet.
So the collar-stud will probably be burst in
vain.
Brisbane had serious troubles with its
fashionable ladies 50 years ago. Courier
files of ISGI tell how a Mrs. Rush was fined
10s. and costs in the police court for ob-
structing the public pathway ivith her
crinoline. Quite recently, the pathway was
also obstructed by a curious crowd collected
round a harem skirt; but these are days
when woman “has her rights,” so no fine
eventuated.
There never was any trouble with domes-
tic servants until the last year or two,
which proves that it is all .the Labor party’s
fault. Still the Brisbane Courier's 50-
years-ago reprint tells how squatter Gillespie,
of Canal Creek, dining with a few friends
noted a strange taste in the food, which he
immediately "tried on the dogs,” whereupon
those dogs died. Gillespie had had a quarrel
with the cook, and the cook went to gaol
over the poisoning business. Also, within
the same week, at Mclntyre Brook, John
Brown, landlord of the Diggers’ Arms, ven-
tured to ask the cook to hurry along the
breakfast, whereat the cook “stabbed his
master to the,* heart, and put the body on
the fire.
Beau : Labor members and pressmen
have been doing their darnedest to make
Denham give the election dates away, but
Digby merely assumes an inscrutable air
and retires into his belltopper. Speaking
for myself, if I wanted to make dead sure
of the date, I would meander round to the
motor garages and ascertain the names of
the individuals who are securing options
over the available cars for May next.
The Flower-Strewn Path.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the Legislative Assembly Mr. Swayne asked Mr.
roVibVi ~S eelnS that in the case of the Trades
Halt Bill the monetary deposit and other conditions
hitherto required in connection with Bills of this de-
scription were not required, is it the intention of the
Government in future to treat schools of arts and
similar bodies in a like manner when asking Parlia-
f°r an extension of their borrowing powers?”
“ In cases where the interests
art laigely of a public character the rule is to charge
only actual out-of-pocket expenses, such as printing.

It was the Local Member,
He was a man of parts—
A leader in the Bogville Shire,
And Bogville’s School of Arts.
And in the name of Bogville—
Three hundred adults grown—
The Member boldly kept the floor ;
He talked for seven hours, and more ;
Repeating o’er, and o’er, and o’er
The case for Bogville’s Loan!
He urged a hundred reasons,
He pleaded floods and drought;
He said they’d had good seasons,
And there were more about.
And, further, things looked gloomy,
As everyone would own—-
Therefore he urged with might and main—
Although there’d recently been rain,
And might be, possibly, again,
He be permitted to explain
The case for Bogville’s Loan!
He wished .to ask the Premier,
\V ith whom he disagreed,
Whose policy was dreamier
I hail anything he’d “see’d,”
What Government intended
To do? Had he not shown
With proper moderation,
And apt gesticulation,
In lengthy dissertation,
So vital to the Nation,
The need for bogville’s Loan?
And then the dreamy Premier
Uprose upon his feet,
And beaming on the Member,
Spake thoughtfully, and sweet:
“There’s nought that we hold dearer
Though we should be o’erthrown I
1 wish to make it clearer,
And generally known:
There’s nothing we hold dearer

people were content, because the drink bill
pei stomach climbed in the same period
from £2 19s. Bid. to £3 15s. s|d. The sly-
grog folk didn’t object, because business
flourished, and all was large profits and
small fines. The boozing individuals had

■ P ® ut > thereabouts, everybody began to tire
oi a game which, like a pup chasing his flv
whisk, seemed to lead nowhere in particular,
bo it was agreed to make new rules for a
resh start in 1911. First of all, the public
was offered a vote on national prohibition,
the. conditions _ being that if a three-fifths
majority was given in its favor, then Bung's
business was to up stick four years later
and, except for medicinal, scientific, sacra-
mental or industrial purposes, liquor was
not to be obtainable unless the obtainer was
prepared to risk £lOO for the experiment,
lire importation, manufacture or sale of
grog was to be on a par with assault and
battery, and the pot 0’ beer luncheon over
the bar was to pass out in favor of the ginger
ale teed in the bath-bun pagoda. In addi-
f*cm to national option, the voter retained
the original local option—License or No-
license —but the Reduction issue was deleted
from the ballot paper. The result clearly
showed that the old game has become a back
number, if the figures may be taken as anv
sort ot reasonable proof. They worked out
in this way :
Continuance. Reduction. No-lioense
1908.. 188,140 162,562 221 471
1911.. 229,562 No vote 226!684
1908.. Majority for No-license .. 33 331
1911 •• ~ ~ Continuance.. 2.878
On th® Question of national prohibition.
205,bb4 votes were, according to the cable
cast m its favor, and 202,008 against, out
or the 408,472 votes polled, the whole work-
ing out at the following percentages:—
1908 . . No-license votes .. 53 per cent.
1911 •• .. ~ .. 49 ~ ~
1911 .. Prohibition ~ .. 55 ~’
The preference for national prohibition is
given more point by the voting in the four
chief cities. Thus:—
Majority for Majority for
Continuance. Prohibition.
Auckland .. 840 1149
Wellington .. 2176 1762
Christchurch.. 1018 1661
Dunedin .. 408(for N.-l.) 3316
In order to have brought about Dominion
prohibition, 60 per cent, of the votes cast
was required to be in its favor, so that the
LOid Tea crowd just missed unlimbering
the water-cart by hardly 5 per cent. An-
other 19,000 odd votes, and they would have
been belting the welkin with their brollies.
As a matter of fact, if the large Roman
Catholic community had not been officially
warned by the head of the church in M.L. not
to vote for prohibition, there was a doubt-
iul chance of the required margin being
reached. The warning was issued as the re-
sult of the Archbishop’s fear, born of an in-
discreet statement by a Sydney parson, who
ranipaged through the campaign, that the
H2O vehicle would eventually be driven to
the very steps of the altar, and the sacra-
mental wine be cut off. And there is
no doubt he had some reason for his fear,
because not even an archbishop knoweth
where the fanatic will cease from troubling
and the weary be at rest. An-
other disappointment to the anti-liquor
army lay in the fact that, while licenses were
not restored in any of the alleged “dry” dis-
tricts, No-license was not extended to any
other district, consequently there will be no
pubs to. close next June, and it will be a dull
month in Snuffledom. Meanwhile, Stiggins
is hissing through the keyhole of the bar
that the writing is on the wall, and Bung,
who was as staggered at the gigantic vote in
favor of no grog as his melancholy pursuer,
is feeling sufficiently downhearted to seek
solace in the blue rum he keeps for the deep-
sea sailors. The only explanation of the
vote that protrudes itself is that the Maori-
lander, finding himself unable to moderate
his appetite and keep his daily nips from
overcrowding, is making up his mind to re-
move the temptation beyond his reach. If he
decides for prohibition in 1914, the scheme
will receive a trial in a country specially
adapted for the purpose, and the citizen who
feels that he. must have a drop of something
with a bite in it will be compelled to cross
1200 miles of the Pacific track to get it.
Altogether, it will be an interesting experi-
ment to watch —from a distance.

AVON
THE good name of the mother country is
bound up. in AVON MOTOR TYRES.
The home folk who run their cars on
AVO NS are not looking any more for the per-
fect tyre, because the manufacture of AVONS,
always at the top notch of modernity, is conducted on the
principle that not the most scientific machinery can make si
purses out of sows’ ears; that the strength, endurance an
speediness demanded of the motor tyre must be derived rom
material of the finest, deftly handled.
Other Specialties of this Firm include—
MECHANICAL RUBBER FOR RAILWAYS.
Avon Buffer and Drawbar Springs Brake Materials Body Fittings,
Valves, Hose, etc., specially adapted tor use in the tiopics. Contrac

Marvellous’ Things
Cuticura Soap and
Ointment are Doing
For Skin Troubles
“I suffered dreadfully for twelve months with eczema and chapped hands.
I tried all medicines recommended by my friends, which all proved failures til 1
f took my father’s advice and tried Cuticura Soap. On going to bed at night
M
m
\ I !'! i
' ! <hwr4 ‘ ‘
my hands and lips used to commence to burn and
itch something terribly and sleep seemed impos-
sible, as it caused terrible pain and suffering from
the bleeding and itching, and in the morning my
hands and lips were all over blood.
“So I took dad’s advice and tried both Cuti-
cura Ointment and Soap. I bathed in Cuticura
Soap before retiring for the night and then treated
my face with the Cuticura Ointment. The result
was marvellous, wonderfully cheap and quick, for
in a month all trouble on hands and face had disap-
peared.
“The eczema that my little sister, five years
old, suffered so much from was in her head. My
mother used to apply the Cuticura Ointment to the
scalp on going to bed, which cured her in a fort-
night. My little brother had a frightful cut on the foot three inches long and
Cuticura Ointment cured it; he bathed it first and applied the Ointment after-
wards. Marvellous! So you can see the use of Cuticura Ointment and Soap
in our house is much appreciated; the Soap is also a beautiful toilet soap.
(Signed) Miss Ida E. Leary, “Oakwood,” Queen’s Road, Five Dock, Sydney,
N.S.W., Dec. 19, 1910.
“The trouble that affected my little girl started in her head like ringworm..
Then it went all over her head. The head swelled, and it went in the form of
matter and all the hair came off her head. It was very itchy. She could not
sleep and I began to think she would never get better. I tried a lot of adver-
tised remedies, but all to no avail. She was like this for over three months
until I tried a pot of Cuticura Ointment. I had not used that pot before she
was completely cured. The hair grew again, and you would never know that
there had been anything wrong with her head.” (Signed) Mrs. P, J, Collins,
Merlwood, Humffray St. North, Ballarat East, Vic., Dec. 5, 1910.
“For several years I have suffered with eczema on the face, hands and
bodv and when it got very bad I would spend night after night without any
sleep, and at times I would feel like scratching myself to pieces, I tried several
so-called remedies without getting the slightest relief. One day I was telling
a friend of mine the pain I was suffering, and she told me to try the marvellous
Cuticura Ointment. I did this, and lam very pleased to state that to-day I
am quite free from all such itching that is brought about by that dreaded
eczema I will never be without a pot "of Cuticura Ointment in the house.
Anyone suffering from eczema, burns, boils, or any other abrasions of the body
could not possiblv do better than keep a pot of Cuticura Ointment pi t ie
house.” (Signed) Mrs, T- J, Hazelwood, Islington, So. Australia, Dec, 0,
mo.
For more than a generation, Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment have
afforded the purest, sweetest and most economical treatment for affections of
the skin that torture, disfigure, itch, burn, crust, scale and destroy sleep. A
single cake of Cuticura Soap and a box of Cuticura Ointment are often suffi-
cient. Sold throughout the world. Send to E. Towns & Co., Department
3L, Sydney, N.S.W., for a liberal sample of Cuticura Ointment, with 32-page

By “B.B.”:
The ramming of the Olympic by a warship, as that
mammoth liner was threading her way out of South-
ampton (Eng.) recently (the sort of accident that is
going to be common in Sydney as soon as it becomes
the naval base of a big fleet) has raised a legal ques-
tion of interest to sailormen. The question involved
is: “When is a wreck a wreck?” Section 158 of the
Act dealing with such matters says that where the
services of a seaman terminate by reason of the loss
or wreck of his ship, he is entitled to wages only up
to the moment of the wreck. But Section 162 of the
same Act says that “If a seaman is discharged before
he earns a month's pay, without default on his part,
he can claim a month’s remuneration.” The owners
the Olympic was a wreck, wherefore they were
entitled to sack the crew with no more than three
‘lays pay m their jeans. The men claim she wasn’t, and
ask for a month s salary. The dictionaries offer more
opinions as to what a wreck is than the lawyers, and
the magistrates who tried the case at Southampton
were equally divided on the question, and have passed
'‘UP a Superior Court for its say-so. It seems
odd that such, a debatable point should have been so
long in cropping up; but the plain fact is that the
average seaman has such a horror of the Law, that he
is used to taking any old wages the owners like to
hand up, without making any fuss about it. The
common or garden variety of justice would suggest
. that Section 108 oi the Act be sewn up in a liam-
rnock and dropped in the deep, deep sea, with a brace
; .i re , b „ a [ s lashed to its shins. No doubt men are
hang on to their ship for a little longer, and
lisk then lives for a few more hours, pumping to keeD
a leaky craft from foundering under their feet, if they
know their pay stops the minute she goes under • but
such an inducement shouldn’t be thrust in their ’wav

FOOD
is for Infants and Invalids
and for those whose digestive
powers have become weakened by

If the digestive functions, however weak, can do
any work at all they should be given work to do to the
extent of their powers. In the easy process of its prepara-
tion the digestibility of Benger’s can be regulated to give
this work with extreme nicety.
The “British Medical Journal” says—“Benger’s Food
has, by its excellence established a reputation ot its own.”

Owing to the inability of the makers to
keep up with the demands of the selling staff, the
Dunlop Rubber Co. has been driven to make exten-
sive additions to the mills at Montague (Melbourne),
running to about £30,000. When they have been
completed, the company will be turning out over
1000 tyres per week.
Ben Hall”: Hunt, M.L.A., asked a question in
the N. S. Wales Assembly recently, which opens the
way to another from me. He desired to be in-
formed how much money, deposited for season tic-
kets, has been held by the Railway Department for
the past five, 10, 15 and 20 years ; what is done with
the money, and in what way the interest upon it is
treated ? At time of writing the Government was
thinking it out, and while we’re waiting I’d like to ask
the same question of the gas monopolies, who demand
£1 cash before they’ll talk business with customers.
Tens of thousands of pounds must be held by those
companies; and, while there may be some justifica-
tion for insisting upon a deposit, there is absolutely
lone for grabbing the interest. It is true that one
if the big companies pays over to the depositors the
amount of interest earned by the deposit, but there
are other highwaymen holding up the public who
are not so honest, and if you happen to see the Gov-
ernment passing The Bulletin office, you might
poke this under its trumpet, and yell in its shell-like
ear: “What about it?”
* * * *
“Ricardo”: A few weeks ago, the Bourke-street
drapery store of Wright and Neil, three doors from
the Melbourne G.P.0., was sold to George and George
for £71,000, or £ll5O per foot. They resold to
Myer, from Bendigo, at a price not given, but it
is • the highest ever realised for land in Melbourne
since the Equitable Insurance gave £3OOO per foot
for its Collins and Elizabeth streets corner, at the
crest of the boom. A good Collins-street site has
since been sold at £BOO, though the Bourke and
Swanston corner, known as the Leviathan, fetched
£9OO about two years ago. Myer builds a dry-goods
palace on his expensive plot.
The North Coast (N.S.W.) new flier Wollongbar,
811 tons, a guaranteed 18-knotter with a record of
20, is to be on the Admiralty reserve list. Mean-
while, her object in life is to race up the coast to
Byron Bay and back, in order to keep pace with the
huge butcer output of the district, and drag it to
Sydney before it becomes like “Liberal” politics.
The passionate foolery of hauling everything to Syd-
ney, irrespective of its ultimate destination, obtains
on the coast as well as inland. A vessel of the
Wollongbar type could just as easily cart the cow’s
grease to London from the North Coast as could a
foreign vessel from Sydney, but that, of course,
would not suit Sydney, and what suits Sydney is the
only thing Sydney reckons suitable.
* * * *
“Snaffle”: It looks as though there is trouble ahead
of the Victoria Amateur Racing Club. In the first
place, the vast majority of Caulfield residents are
hostile to it. Your genteel suburbanite sees no points
about having a racecourse, with all its attendant
dust, beer and curse, planted on his front doorstep.
It is estimated that the proposed doubling of the
Caulfield railway lines would cost somewhere about
£1,000,000, and the scheme would benefit none but
the race club people. Therefore, the non-racing
economist rages against it. The V.A.T.C. folk are
only tenants at will, unlike the V.R.C., at .Fleming-
ton, which had a lease. The taking-over" of the
Caulfield course, 30 years ago, was a blessing to the
Government of the day. It meant that the railway
between Prahran and Caulfield would be made to show
a profit. But, since then, the populous suburbs of
Armadale, Malvern, and so forth have sprung up, and
the Caulfield race days don’t matter so much. The
V.A.T.C. holds privileges that the V.R.C. would give
big money for. For instance, the V.A.T.C. is al-
lowed to charge for entrance to the flat,
and does so, to the extent of 2s. 6d. per
head. The V.R.C. has no such right, though
it has sought it for years past. Imagine
what Is. a head would mean at the Melbourne Cup
meeting? The Flemington racecourse is one of the
best in the world. The Caulfield course is one of
the worst. The accommodation for the public on the
flat is a by-word throughout Australia, everything
being lavished on the grand stand and lawn. The
privileged members there really get their pleasure
cheaper than the flattites. The subscription is £5
per year, with entry to all meetings, and this in-
cludes two ladies, who also get free railway tickets.
Seemingly, the V.A.T.C. has been scenting danger for
some time. Anyhow, it has accumulated a reserve of
£20,000.

A Victorian inventor has designed a motor
chassis, which he considers specially suited for the
rough Australian roads. The revolution is in the
arrangements of suspension and springing, and if it
does all that is claimed for it, riding over the
roughest roads will be like going to rest in a feather
bed. The original model was made in Melbourne,
and subjected to a succession of tests, from which it
emerged triumphantly. A syndicate took it up, and,
(the pity of it) promptly sent it to France, where a
big firm of makers grabbed it enthusiastically. The
chassis is suspended on a compound cantilevei
system, entirely different from any on the market,
and within a few weeks some of the first models
turned out in France will arrive in Australia.

“X. 0..”: A tip to those who are looking for a
residential or week-end allotment with a water front-
age to one of the numerous tidal bays and creeks
within easy reach of Sydney. If you buy at high
tide, do your inspecting at low-tide. You’ll thus
probably escape buying a “frontage” that is only
mud 12 hours out of the 24, and, to boot, has most
of the characteristics of a manure or glue factory.
THE HAPPY RENTS OF HUNTER-STREET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Evidence showed that the rents of buildings in
Hunter-street had been raised at intervals of a few
weeks. —Sydney news item.
The happy rents of Hunter-street
To higher things aspire;
At last, at last, they climb to meet
The landlord’s vast desire;
They mount on wings as aeroplanes,
They soar as soars the dove,
Rejoicing in the gladsome gains
Their modest owners love.
Up, up the bright demands arise!
Up with each flying week!
They leap towards the shining skies
To touch the white stars meek.
The wheels of trade may rumble by,
Or sales and business cease,
The landlord’s profits, wet or dry,
Must evermore increase.
Behind the desk or counter still
Men earn their humble crust,
While, from a full or empty till,
They pay because they must;
But, idle as the pleasant cow,
That lolls in meadows sweet,
No perspiration damps the brow
Of him who owns the street.
Dull as a drove of lowing beef,
The public makes no fuss,
Save to remark, “ ’Tis past belief
The way they tread on us.”
Joyous as doormats in the rain,
They speak no angry word,
Save to remark with passing pain
That rents are now absurd.
But were the landlord’s happy ways
Applied in other spheres,
The dust the populace would raise
Would shake the coming years;
Each cheated citizen would roar
Against the rent-man’s tricks,
And, as his fathers did of yore,
Discuss the theme with bricks.

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the shin
is naturally and deservedly beauty's
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears* Soap fof
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
shin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre*
eminent degree as

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A wireless message was received from the steamer
Uaheno last night, stating that she was 520 miles
from Sydney, was experiencing good weather, and re-
ports “all well.” —Shipping News.
1 WATCHED it go from the Nation’s
gate, where the backwash rippled
and swirled, *\
Till its vast black trail was a pencil
smudge on the deep blue rim of the
world;
Aud the ocean wind took the last few wisps,
and it spun them exceeding fine;
Then 1 looked again. There was naught to
see but the empty horizon line!
Twas as if the sea liM brought down its
prey. Like a lion it sprang and roared
When the silv’ry blade of the sunset light
flickered out like a new-drawn sword.;
But the night came down on the heaving
waste, and the beam like a diamond
shone,
As it swung and searched in its tireless
round for the vessel I knew had gone.
As the mourner waits by the open grave, so
I waited beside the sea,
And an undertakerish wind went by. But
I’d brought a good'friend with me;
And I drew the cork with my two front
teeth, and drank him, and wanted more,
Then the empty whizzed through the haunted
dark, and exploded upon the shore!
Jly dial was stiff w y ith the ocean brine, and
I suffered from deep sea blues,
When over the hidden horizon rim came
cheerfully commonplace news ;
The ship was keeping its usual course, and
had nothing at all to tell;
I knew none on board, but felt quite glad
when the sparkogram said : “All well.”
The poet sits down by the salted sea, and
makes funeral wreaths of song ;
As a rule, he is much too full of .gloom, and
his funeral ode too long; ~
But his funeral ode he sells for beer—which,
of course, is excellent stuff;
If you meet him when he’s absorbing it, you
will find him cheerful enough.
Now I will confess that I meant this rhyme
to be windy and full of gloom;
1 meant it to make you depressed, and think
long thoughts of a bottomless tomb ;
But a cold wind blew through my own back
hair, so I longed for some light and
cheer,
And the wireless muttered, “All well,” so I
have adjourned for a heap of beer.
N.S.W.
PONTIUS RUM.
Alone in Sydney.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
retreat of Morley and myself from
Maoriland had been successfully
carried through, and now with our
baggage lying around us in some disorder,
we took a rest in our Sydney lodgings and
examined our resources. My own consisted
of 10s. 9d. in bullion, two decent portman-
teaux, a watch and a fair stock of impu-
dence.
Morley was more affluent. Ilis bullion
amounted to a whole 325.; and he had a
gold ring and a silver watch of superior
manufacture; but he had only one port-
sammy. As for impudence—his supply was
just unlimited, and I was, in fact, rather
frightened that his superabundance would
be a bit of a burden.
“There's one thing in our favor. Nobody
knows us here, so no matter what we do
we’re not going to be disgraced. In a
strange place where one has no friends he
can do anything, from burglary to two-up,
and be cheeky over it,” said Morley, wag-
ging his head wisely.
“The trouble is that we shall soSn know
quite a lot of people, though!” I said.
“And it is remarkable what a small place
the world is. Why, before the week is out
I’ll bet we meet someone we know strolling
down George-street. Anyhow, let’s go out
and see about something to eat. I’m starv-
ing.”
We were discussing whether we should
patronise a “full and plenty” establishment,
or smash up a florin in a Dago fish shop,
when I was slapped heavily on the back,
and a familiar voice remarked that all hope
of the speaker’s eternal salvation had actu-
ally vanished.
I turned round in some alarm, as there
were some people I was not anxious to
meet. But it was only Davy Greig. I in-
quired what he was doing in Sydney, and he
cheerfully confided that he “had done a bunk,”
and was en route for Java, where he said
there was no extradition treaty, except for
murder, burglary and other crimes of vip-
lence.
“And what’s your little lot?” I inquired
sympathetically.
“Oh, just plain embezzlement —a mere
trifle; £350 in Bard cash, and about the
same amount in accumulated deficit. Well,
where are you off to?”
“To tell the truth we're just debating if
we can afford another bob meal each, or had
we better get down to fourpence right
away.”
“Oh, that’s horrible,” said Greig in a
shocked voice. “F'ourpenny scratches are
downright low. Never be seen coming out
of them. If you are you’re damned.”
“Well, when the cash is all gone we are
damned whether we’re found or not. I re-
gret to say we didn’t manage things as well
as you.”
“Well, come and have a bite with me. I
leave to-morrow morning.”
So we proceshed up the street, and in 10
minutes had run Greig’s account up to three
half-crowns. Then we offered to see him
home, but he declined, and saw us home in-
stead, and on the way he bought some liquor
with which we were to drink to his pros-
perity in Java.
It was 10 p.m. when he started for his
diggings, and Morley went out with him to
post a letter, and that was the last I saw of
either of them. Morley’s top coat lay on
the floor, his worst suit was hanging be-
hind the door, his portsammy was gaping in
the corner; and for all I know they may be
there yet. I left them when I left, the fol-
lowing night, to take up my important
chi ties as deck hand on a steaSner that slept
at Manly.
Two days as a deck hand satisfied me it
was no place for a man with ambition. But
for the sake of the wages I stuck to it for a
week. Immediately I drew my pay I
walked off, and never went back even to get
my old coat in the stoke hole. I went home
and arrayed myself in my last suit, and
started back for city life.
Arrived in the town, I found quarters
with a man who was interested in profes-
sional bruising. That same evening he
came in arrayed in a sweater, and throwing
me a pair of gloves, requested that I would
kindly smite him on the nose at the rate of
2s. per hour if I was any good. 1 waded in
with alacrity. I didn’t know anything
about the finer art of boxing, but I had con-
siderable experience of fighting of a, rough
and tumble order. Moreover, I was in good
condition, and after fastening the mits with
my teeth, I squared up.
“Hit me, hit me, you ruffian!” he yelled,
dancing about, twirling his gloves and pok-
ing his face at me.
“Certainly, with pleasure!” I replied,
feinting with the left and bringing a heavy
right on to his ear. As I saw him swaying
there, almost helpless, I forgot that it was
only practice, and I shot out a short left
jolt to the point which sent him to the
boards with a great bang.
“Are you hurt?” I inquired as he made
no effort to rise.
“Oh, no, not a bit. I’m quite sensible,
but my legs won’t work. They’ll be all
right in a minute. Great Scroggings, where
did you learn to hit, you ?”
“I didn’t hit; they were only taps.”
“They w r ere only taps, were they? Well,
you’ll tap me no more like that, I’ll take
mighty fine care. This room ain’t large
enough. Better come down to the club.”
The club was an awful place—gloomy,
dirty and full of strange ungodly stinks. I
was requested to “remove my duds an’ put
my valuables in my trousers pockets.” Then
my friend took charge of my boots, which
he carried over one arm, and he had my
coat, waistcoat and shirt suspended over
the other. .
I was asked to get into the ring. My
guide came to the ropes and explained :
“They’s tryin’ you out; an’ if you makes
good, they’ll put some scraps in your way.
Don’t lose your block, an’ just ‘tap’ him,” lie
remarked sarcastically.
A fat benevolent-looking referee, said a
few words about clean breaks, no hitting in
“holts” unless both hands ivas free, an’ to be
careful of “yer elbows.”
My opponent, a weedy-looking wretch, alt
legs and wings, approached me in great
style, twirling his gloves in a marvellous
manner. I watched him curiously, and be-
fore I knew it, had received a hang on the
eye, a bash on the nose, a couple on the top
of the head; and then the apparition was
away at the other side of the ring, dancing-
like a mad dervish.
“Lor’ blime, go arfter ’im. ‘Tap’ him;
why the blazes don’t you ‘tap’ him?”
It was my backer that was yelling. A
feeling of shame swept through me. I
mustn’t disgrace this good-hearted fellow
who was evidently doing his best for me. I
rushed at the dancing dervish. I saw him
stop dancing and eye me warily.
“I like rushers!” he said as he leaned
over and sent his right through, my guard
and over my shoulder. I saw his left was
coming, and ducked. He missed me. A
look of fear came into his face, and then it
was obliterated as I sent him clean through
the ropes over the first row of chairs on to
the fat referee.
Seeing him scramble to his feet I went
through the ropes after him. But a dozen
hands held me, and the voice of my guide
howled: —•
“Don’t lose your block; don’t lose your
block!”
“I’ve had enough,” said the rooster. . A
man of science ain’t got no show against
these hard hitters. If they gets wan in, it's
all out —an’ p’raps a broken jawr. There’s
nothing in it.”
“He’s swinging in ther balance,” said my
friend as we made for home. “Sez you
ain’t a fighter but a slogger, an’ ver’ ex-
citable. But I told him you ain’t had no
’perience, an’ got to learn th’ game. Anny-
how, you’ve got ther run of ther club, an’
that’s a sort of a livin’ for yer. There’s
always a substitute being wanted, an’ a
bloke like you’ll get plenty of work ; as a
sparrin’ partner. I’ve got you set up.”
“Well, what about a beer?”
“Never touch it —an’ you’d better chuck
it, too. Gen’l’men of our profession has to
live clean —no swipes an’ that sorter thing.
S’truth, the road to glory an’ dollars is
paved with the wrecks of good blokes who’s
drowned their charnces in swig.”
For the want of somewhere better to go, I
went to the club frequently, and when my
friend’s scrap came off, I was in his corner,
waving a towel over him in the intervals,
shameless in the fond belief that no one
there would know me.
Poor old chap! He was knocked right
out in the third round, and the audience
howled for its money’s worth.
Down below we were rubbing him down,
bathing his contusions, and applying cold
steak to one particularly nasty bash, when
the proprietor hurried down.
“Struth, them blokes is going to market
proper. The other chaps ain’t turned up—
leastways one of ’em hasn’t, an’ there’s goin’
to be a riot by ther look of things.”
“Well, what are you going to do about it?
They won’t come down here, will they?”
“Gord knows wot they’ll do if they gets
properly goin’. I’ll give yer five pun to
come up and put up a real raw meat scrap
with the chap wot’s turned up. Otherwise,
they’ll pull the place about our ears.”
I closed with the offer before he could
change his mind ; but he showed no signs of
doing so. Shouting something to a half-
naked man in the corner, he waddled up fhe
ladder, and presently there was comparative
stillness, and I could hear the yells of the
proprietor announcing that “An Unknown”
of high degree and marvellous natural fight-
ing ability would fill the gap.
Five minutes later I was scrambling
through the ropes.
“Make it raw meat,” whispered the pro-
prietor.
Fighting before a limited audience and a
packed house are very different proposi-
tions. Curious how one can hear the re-
marks from all around. The other gentle-
man txus sitting in his corner, his coat
thrown over his shoulders, eyeing me criti-
cally.

Then I sat down while they tied on my
gloves, and as they did so I glanced round
the ring at the people in the “chairs” at
-Is. per time. The referee caught me by
the shoulder and dragged me to the middle
° u tlle my hand was placed in the
other fellow s, something was murmured
about a clean break and hitting in “holts
anu over the din of voices and through the
rolling clouds of tobacco smoke came an
awful voice:—
Make it raw meat, an’ give ’em their
money s worth.”
Make it raw meat yerself!” snarled my
opponent as he walked towards his chair.
1 lien the gong sounded, and he sprang at
me like a tiger. I had to bend almost to
the floor to avoid his rushes. And as soon
as 1 could get a chance I did a bit of rush-
ing myself. We got into clinches and
roughed frantically, and the crowd howled
with delight.
“Make it raw meat, Billo!” howled the
proprietor’s voice.
“He’n offer extra splosh presently,
matey, said my opponent, cool as a cucum-
ber, while he appeared to be making fearful
efforts to hit “That’s right, kid stakes—
that s what they pay for!” lie remarked as
he ‘broke away, and the gong Sounded.
‘ You’re doin’ dam fine splendid!” said
the proprietor to me as they mopped and
l tinned,: and then lie deliberately walked
round to BillbV corner and said something,
probably the same, to him.
Instead of hitting', Billo clinched imme-
diately.
He ain t riz my price yet," he whis-
pered. “JNor mine,” 1 replied. “Well go
slow then. We tire.” And with that he
swung a tearful wallop over my shoulder
and broke away once more.
Playing “kid stakes” is a fine art to
which I was not apprenticed. 1 tried to do
1 u an * badly. The crowd hooted me
cheerfully, and one man slung a banana
into the ring.
“Yaff! Boo!” came from everywhere.
..?t, did we pay to seeV Parss ’em out !"
“It sno good—he won’t come it. Mix,it: J”
And he mixed it. But: the gong went and
saved me.
Again the proprietor' " approached the
corner.
“I’ve bin watching him. He's on the
niake. Hive you another 50 bob to chaw
him right up, ther cow!” said iiis hoarse
whisper.. Then he ducked round behind me,
and arrived in Billo’s vicinity just before
the gong sounded. He said something to a
second, and lie in turn whispered to Billo,
and when Billo came up after the gong
sounded I saw he had forgotten our brief
friendship. In fact, he didn’t know me;
and he waded in to make such a picture of
me that I lost my temper, and deliberately
set to work to do battle, butchery and sud-
den death.
After that, coherent recollection ends.
Ilie rest was a rushing delirium, a waving
ot arms, a blood-tinted mist. The only
sounds were a far-off roaring, grunts and
sighs as blows were driven home, gasps as I
smote wliere the openings appeared momen-
tarily, and occasional flashes of stars.
Suddenly, for one brief moment, it all
became visible. The gore cleared from my
sight. Down in the front row, in evening
dress, a smile on his classic features, I saw
Morley and some Maoriland friends.
And he was watching me.
A smash on the side of the head sent me
down, and the picture of Morley’s sardonic
smile was blotted out by Billo’s battered,
blood-stained and anxious countenance.
Then I saw a fist smite right into the middle
of it twice, saw Billo’s arms go up, and he
vanished in a ring of blue smoke.
“Cripes, but lie had you knocked out
three times ’cording to all the rules of the
gime; an’ every time you got up an’ sent
him down. Poor bloke, his nose is broke.
Didn’t yer. hear the ref. shout to yer not to
hit him agin?” said my dresser.
“Well, the boss said he wanted it made
raw meat —and Billo said to mix it, and
everybody was shouting, something, and the
only thing to do was hit Billo’s face every
time I saw it. I only saw it about four
times.”
“Yes, I thort he had you dead to the
world. Yous one of those blokes who goes
on stoushin’ when he oughter be dead—
alius dangerous men to meet. Here’s the
boss with yer splosh.”
“GenTman an’ party from Maoriland
waiting upstairs to see you,” said the pro-
prietor. “ ’Struth, but you are a pretty
sight for a supper party.”
But I got out the back way, and had sup-
per with Billo and his neat little wife in
their cottage in Palmer-street, in the Tx>o.
And, somehow, I think it was more enjoy-
able.
C. A. JEFFRIES.
Billjim's Back Fence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was a warm, summer evening, in the
little town of Austral Flat, in the year
19—. Upon a western hill, at the
back of the town, five giant gum trees were
sharply silhouetted against the blood-red
sky. Three or four men leaned idly upon
the railings of the town reserve, watching a
score of schoolboys playing football; while
upon the calm, still, evening air floated the
strains of “Rule Britannia,” played upon a
tin-whistle by Mat the Musician. From
down the street came the rhythmic ringing
of a blacksmith’s anvil, where the German
smith, known locally as “Old Berlin,”
worked at his forge; and, anon, the voices
of Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Phillip rose and
fell, as they argued, over the back fence,
about a brindle cow. A spring-cart rattled
down the uneven main as old man
Primble drove away from thy. local pub,
with a large, heavy jar. On the hotel veran-
dah, the local policeman leaned -against one
of the posts, and argued about prize fowls
with the landlord, who reposed against an
empty beer barrel. In the town pound, Mrs.
Dolittle’s three milch cows lowed mourn-
fully.
The mayor of the little town, Alderman
Billjjm,. J.P., sat in his back yard, over-
looking a Chinese garden at the rear, and
scanned the sporting columns of the Daily
Gurgle, .wife., swept the back ver-
andah. Suddenly, the mayor raised hii
head.
“By gum!” he said. “I never reckoned
that Sliprails would get a place in the
Grand National. I’ve watched that ’orse
carefully, too.”
“You’d be better employed,” replied his
wife tartly, “if you' watched that back fence
of ours. It’s a disgrace to the neighborhood.
And you the mayor, too! Pretty mayor, in-
deed.”
“Aw right, me dear, aw right,” said the
mayor, somewhat impatiently. “I’ll see to
it when I have time to think to get some
nails and a ’ammer.”
“Nails, indeed,” retorted the lady. “Why
don’t you get ’em at once and be done with
it? Some day, one of those wretched pigs
of Ah Foo’s will get through and bite some
of the children. You know what savage
brutes they are.”
“Aw right, me dear,” replied Billjim, pre-
paring to return to his reading. “Father
promised to let me ’ave the loan of one of his
dawgs if I wanted it. I’ll see about it in
the mornin’.”
It was a muggy summer evening in the
little township of Austral Flat, five years
later. Upon a western hill three giant gum-
trees showed black against a lurid sky. A
small group of lusty youths and men sat
upon the reserve fence, watching half a dozen
small boys shooting at birds with “shang-
hais,” while the strainU of “Soldiers of the
King,” played upon a mouth-organ by Mat
the Musician, were borne upon the gentle
breeze. Now loud, now faint, came the
voices of Mrs. Phillip and Mrs. Jackson, as
they disputed, over the back fence, about a
black and tan dog ; and up the street rattled
a spring-cart, as old man Brimble drove to-
wards the pub with a large, empty jar.
Upon the hotel verandah the local
policeman leaned against the wall,
and argued about the cause and cure of warts
with the publican, who sat on the edge of
the pavement; while, fpom across the road,
came the tinkle of an anvil, as “Old Berlin,”
the blacksmith, hammered away industri-
ously. In the town pound Mrs. Dolittle’s
only cow lowed plaintively.
In his back yard, - ' overlooking a Chinese
garden and piggery, the mayor, Alderman
Billjim, newly re-elected, sat upon an up-
turned bucket, reading the football reports
in the Morning Megaphone.
• Suddenly, Billjim looked up and smacked
his thigh.
‘‘Six goals in the last quarter!” he ex-
claimed. “By crikey ! I wish I’d been there
to see it.”
“You’d be better employed,” snapped his
wife, “attending to that back fence. It’s an
eyesore ; and it’s not safe, as I’ve told you a
score of times.”
The mayor looked hurt.
“Why, Susan,” he said; , “didn’t I put
three new palin’s on it only, the week before
last! Don’t be unreasonable.”
. “Three palin’s!” retorted his wife, with
bitter scorn. “What’s three palin’s? What
you want, really, is a good stone wall. If
those pigs of Ah Foo’s get in and harm the
I shall hold you responsible,
mind. You know what vicious brutes they
are.”
“There, there, me dear,” said the mayor
soothingly. “I’ll see about gettin’ one of
father’s dawgs.”
“You know very well,” replied his wife,
“that your father said he wanted those dogs
up at his own place. If you’d knock off
that silly old paper for a few months, you
might be able to buy a good watch-dog for
yourself. I’ve no patience with you.”
“There, there, dear,” repeated Billjim,
still more soothingly. _ “I’ll see if I can get
a couple more palin’s in the mornin’, or nex’
week, or sometime.” And, after yelling at
one of. Ah Foo’s pigs that was sniffing at a
crack in the fence, he returned to his read-
ing.
It was a sultry summer evening in the
little town of Austral Flat, some three years
later. The western hill stood bare against
the fiery sky, lit- by the spreading rays of
the setting sun. A dozen men leaned against
the reserve fence, watching four small cadets
at drill. Mat the Musician had been killed
the year before. Now loud, now soft, as the
gentle breezes rose and fell, came the voices
of Mrs. Jackson and Mrs. Phillip, as they
disputed, over the fenc£, about a speckled
fowl. Down the dusty street, past the
hotel, rumbled the funeral procession of old
man Brimble. On the hotel verandah, after
the funeral had passed, the local constable
leaned back against the window-sill and re-
sumed his discussion on the exact locality
of the solar plexus, with the publican, who
lolled in the doorway. In the town pound
Mrs. Dolittle’s goat bleated pathetically;
while the tapping of the German black-
smith’s hammer went on incessantly.
. Suddenly, from down the- street, in a
direction of the mayor’s residence, came a
woman’s shriek, then a hubbub of voices.
A boy, pale with excitement, and panting
with terror, came running up the street to-
wards the hotel.
“Quitik!” he panted, as he came within
speaking distance. “Quick! Police! Mis-
ter Leaner, you’re wanted. One of Ah Foo’s
pigs has killed Mister Billjim’s baby!”
The constable slowly straightened up.
“Spare me days!” he said. “What can I
do? If the youngster’s dead, the Lor can’t
do it no good. S’pose I better go and see,
though.” And he leisurely accompanied the
bo"y down the road.
“Old Berlin,” the German smith, attracted
by the hubbub, came, hammer in hand, to
his smithy door, and learned the news.
e rf Mm righat,” he said brutally.
Serf him righat, der lazy dog! Vy lie don’
mend dot fence of his? I haf no sympadies.
I titty sort of mayor you’ve got, ain’t it’
Vat?”° S der may ° r Id ° tings better as dat
‘‘Listen to ’im,” said the publican, to a
small group of loungers that had assembled.'
Listen to ’im. Fancy we see ourselves with
a bloomin’ Dutchy fer a mayor. Not much '
Billjim’s all right, if ’e’d only get a move on
L rcely ort to mend that fence of ’is, an’
get a dawg or two. Come an’ ’ave a drink
boys, it’s give me bit of a turn.”
“Old Berlin” stood at his door and watched
them enter the hotel.
“Don’ be too sure, Mister Publighause.”
he said. Ven Ido some more vork an’
make some more moneys, p’raps ve see.”-
Then he returned to his shop; and the
evening calm was broken only by the steadv
persistent ring of 'his anvil. - - steady,

Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those' of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, 1 fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair,
since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
P° und - I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. Ido not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested m decrying others—but I do assert
