Australian Flapperature
It must be remembered that when one
reads the work of Mary Grant Bruce and
other purveyors of pleasant stories for
flappers, one has instinctively to apply
to such work a standard of criticism lower
than that one applies to a full-grown novel
like, say, Betty Wayside. The wants of
flappers are more easily filled than the wants
of adults. Flapperature stands in a class
of fiction of its own. So in stating that
From Billabong to London-, by Mary Grant
Bruce (Ward, Lock), is admirably written,
her simple-minded clientele must be taken
into consideration. Her readers want
nothing more than this leisurely painting
of station life; and they will gladly read a
whole chapter devoted to the breaking in of
a bucking colt, though the incident is
merely incidental. So her account of a trip
from Australia to England during war time,
with its occasional mild thrills —including
the capture of a German spy and the threat
of the hold-up of. the vessel by a Hun
auxiliary cruiser—is well written —for the
readers who are content with just that
sort of thrill. And her readers do not
object to the introduction of other adven-
tures that have no bearing on the plot—even
if there were a plot. _ There is no need,
either, of any development of character in
the nice but colorless persons she intro-
duces to us. Mary Grant Bruce merely
depicts with an unobtrusive realism life on a
beautiful Australian station and the experi-
ences of her travellers. She writes well —
well enough for her readers. As flappera-
ture From Billabong to London is honest
and satisfying fare. 1
Ethel Turner is in a higher class. The
Cub, a story of war-time (Ward, Lock), is
her 18th novel; and with it she still charms
her large and loyal public. It is a story
of children and youths that will be eagerly
read by children and youths—and enjoyed by
their elders. Curiously enough, like Mary
Grant Bruce, she has staged the greater
part of her story on shipboard. A little
Belgian refugee orphan is being brought to
Australia by her rescuer, a child of 15; and
there we learn the graphic and pitiable story
of one of the innumerable atrocities committed
by the invading Huns. The shipboard life is
devoted not to thrilling adventure but to a
quiet and interesting study in character.
The Cub, a long-legged Australian boy, is
an admirable piece of characterisation, held
strictly, of course, within the limits neces-
sary for Ethel Turner’s traditional readers.
There must be no love-making, no stirring of
sexual attraction, which at the age of the
Cub and the girl are such frequent psycho-
logical effects of our climate.
The effects of war upon the social life of
Sydney is depicted with insight, and many
a touch that is both accurate and acute. And
though the heroism of the Cub is heightened
somewhat beyond credence, again we must
remember Ethel Turner’s special public. Her
girl readers demand a hero, and that sort of
hero. But where Ethel Turner shows the
reason for her popularity is in her ability to
impart in the midst of her genial commen-
tary upon Australian life that touch of the
genuine pathetic that can seduce even the
hardened heart of the adult. And specially
is this marked in the final chapter where
the girl is seeing her hero off to the war.
She has her little Belgian prot6g6 with her
on the wharf; and that child is a healthy
and genuine child. She does not sorrow
over the departure of her big friend: "she
has found a most delightful puddle on the
wharf. “Brigid herself had one golosh
firmly planted on it, and, charming occur-
rence, a curled brown gum-leaf, marvellously
like a boat, was alongside the golosh, just
as it it were a boat at a quay....lt was
really the most glorious game of all her
whole life.”
That incongruous, yet artistic, touch of
reality is Ethel Turner's real secret.
The age of the reader of HVr’s Heart
Throbs, by Lilian Turner, is 20. This is a
story of young love, sentiment without
passion, and of the change in character,
caused by the coming of the war, in a bored,
selfish and foolish Australian girl. Cynthia
was letting herself flop on the comfortable
station outback. Nothing ever happened to
her —not even a man ; and that is a parlous
situation for any nice-looking Australian
girl. But, in a delightful scene, the declara-
tion of war comes while Cynthia is in the
middle of the perplexities and worries of
matching a certain mauve button. She had
been in every shop in Sydney, and had
failed. That moment was inconsiderately
chosen by England to declare war. But,
with the new duties that crowded upon the
girl, the “knit two —purl two” and Red
Cross duties, and with the enlistment-of the
two men who love her, Cynthia discovers
herself. Lilian Turner writes with a natural
facility, she can add a genuine touch of
pathos at the right place, and she has a skill
in characterisation sufficient for her some-
what unsophisticated and unexacting reader
of 20.
The age of Vera G. Dwyer’s gentle reader
is 17. The reader of A War of Girls ( Ward,
Lock) must be able to look back upon her
early school days with happy memories, but
with a complacent knowledge that she has
so outgrown them that she can now appre-
ciate the humor of those distant days ; and
she must also be able to look eagerly for-
ward to the delights of flirtations and the
prodigious possibility of a proposal. It is
not a book for the young school-girl, for
Vera-G. Dwyer makes fun of. and not with,
the school-girl. It is sympathetic fun, of
course, but the young school-girl takes her-
self quite seriously. And wliat school-girl
would be encouraged to continue A War of
Girls when on the second page she meets
language so diffuse as this sentence: “It had
seemed to Miss Stockley that the unpopu-
lated rear of the hall would be a good place
in which she might increase her lack of
orthographical wisdom, and develop a proper
sense of contrition for it?” And why, unless
she is appealing to adults, should she use a
circumlocution like this: “He had been in
Such desperately ruinous financial difficulties
that, but for the other’s timely aid, tendered
at considerable sacrifice to himself, he would
have been overwhelmed by them”? But her
story has feminine humor in it, and just
enough young love to please feminine 17.
The plot is rather cleverly and capably
woven, from the slightest strands, and here
and there are some interesting characterisa-
tions. A War of Girls is excellent flappera-
ture.
A Little Bush Poppy , by Edith Graham
(Lothian, Melb., 3s. 6d.), is for the girl of
12 or 15. Here we are pleasantly intro-
duced to some more “Little Australians”
and follow their escapades with sympathetic
interest. The humor —an important thing
in this sort of story—would be understood
by the child-reader herself. The children
are real; and the author rightly makes the
love interest of the grown-ups, who. of
course, are never older than 21. a subsidiary
part of the plot. Yet one wonders why such
a subject need be introduced at all into a
story of children, for children. One curious
point in Australian flapperature is that the
authors almost invariably introduce an
author among their leading characters. Usu-
ally it is the hero who writes an Australian
novel, which is immediately accepted and
brings the author “fame.” Occasionally it
is the heroine who does it; but invariably
at least one of the kiddies has aspirations
toward fiction or verse. In A Little Bush
Poppy the child not only writes stories and
verse, but Edith Graham reprints them.
Either every Australian girl writes, or wants
to write, verse, or the authors of our flappera-
ture. are singularly alike and singularly fool-
ish in their choice of their ideal man.
j*
The Isle of Palms, by Charles Barrett
(Lothian, Melb., 3s. 6d.) is hardly to be
included under this title, since it is an
adventure story for boys. But what girl
does not read her brother’s books? This is
a good yarn of treasure-hunting on the
usual Pacific island of romance, done by a
writer who is also a naturalist. The yarn
is told in simple style; the adventures are
exactly the sort of adventures that recur in
beys’ books, and, incidentally, the child-
reader will gather some interesting facts
about the life of insect, bird and animal.
Just the thing for the Australian kid.

A second edition of .Tas. A. Philp’s shilling
volume, Some Bulletin Stories, has been
called for.
Readers are reminded that the competi-
tion for the six best Australasian short
stories closes on December 10. A guinea
will be paid the competitor who submits a
list of six, or less, short stories written by
Australasians that most nearly corresponds,
in order and in contents, with the six stories
that top the poll of the aggregate votes.
War Personalities
According to A. 6. Gardiner, author of
The War Lords (Dent, per Dymoek’s
Library), the person primarily to blame for
all the trouble was not the Kaiser, but the
Crown Prince. It is reported, on high
authority, that when the Kaiser threw his
pen on the table after signing the declara-
tion of war against Russia, he said to the
triumphant soldiers around him: “Gentle-
men, you will live to regret this.” Add to
this another “well-informed” incident. When
the Crown Prince heard of his father’s
hurried return from his cruise in Norwegian
waters, he said to one of the military cabal:
illiam is back ; but he is too late.”
Elsewhere Gardiner says: “The Crown
Prince played a leading part in the military
conspiracy that led to the war. His rela-
tions with his father had been notoriously
bad. He had allied himself openly with the
military extremists; and there is a wide-
spread and well-informed opinion that it was
the fear of his son that was largely respon-
sible for the marked change in the attitude
of the Kaiser [toward war] in 1913 It
was believed that the Kaiser would never be
coerced into making the plunge, and he was
openly accused-of cowardice. In the Crown
Prince was found an easy tool with which to
bring the Kaiser to heel. The alliance of
the heir-apparent with the war party became
an open menace to the authority of the
Kaiser.” In the notorious Zabern incident
the Crown Prince openly and defiantly threw
over his allegiance to his father. But the
indictment of history against the Kaiser will
not be that he wanted war, but that his
policy could not end in anything but war.
This series of character impressions of 20
personalities thrown into sudden fame by
the war, ranging from the Kaiser to M.
Venizelos, is brilliantly written, as those who
recall this author’s Pillars of Society will
expect. His conclusion about Wilhelm is:
“Perhaps the Kaiser is mad. Pride such as
his is hardly consistent with sanity. But
certainly the peoples of Europe will be mad
if, after this frightful lesson, they do not
make an end on the earth forever of the
doctrine of the Divine right of kings.”
d*
Gardiner states liis belief that there is a
letter in existence written by Admiral Fisher
in 1905 in which he prophesied that there
would be war with Germany in 1914, and
that the then Captain Jellicoe would be the
Admiralissimo. Remarkable, if true. But
Gardiner shows that this twin-prophecy was
something more than guesswork. 3905 was
the year of the creation of the Dreadnought,
and the Dreadnought threw the Kiel Canal
out of commission for a certain number of
years. For to meet the Dreadnought the
Germans had to build as big a boat, and the
just completed Kiel Canal was too shallow
to float it. It would take till 1914 before
the Kiel Canal could be reconstructed. As
for the second part of the alleged prophecy,
Fisher, convinced that the first part would
prove true, had to meet the expected chal-
lenge with the right man in charge of the
British navy. He had discovered Captain
Jellicoe, and decided that he was the only
man for the big job. But there was no
chance for Jellicoe’s promotion in time if
the red-tape of seniority was considered.
“Those who in the intervals have followed
events in the navy closely know how the ful-
filment of the prophecy has been brought
about. Perhaps only the courage of a
Churchill could have carried through the
rapid shufflings of men and officers necessary
to accomplish the object. It was accom-
plished at the last moment. As the hour
struck Jellicoe appeared as the Admiral-
issimo of the fleet.” Fisher, barring acci-
dents, was betting on a cert.
One of the most interesting character
sketches in the volume is that of Nicholas
of Montenegro. He.is the reincarnation of
the Anthony Hope romance. And, incident-
ally, he does a flourishing export business-
in daughters. One of his daughters is the
Queen of Italy, one the Queen of Servia, one
is' the wife of the Russian Grand Duke
Nicholas, and the fourth a wife of his bro-
ther. King Ferdinand of Bulgaria is an-
other character from fiction. “He is the
king of melodrama.... There are times when
you almost doubt whether he was not in-
vented by Dumas or Stevenson or Anthony
Hope.... As a matter of fact, Ferdinand was
invented by his mother.” For it was she who
trained him to fit any throne that might
happen to be to-let. “He was whisked from
capital to capital, habituated to the company
of princes, indoctrinated with the diplomatic
subtleties of The Prince, taught the facile
graces of the charmeur, made to cultivate
entomology as one of those hobbies that sit
so prettily on potentates, coached in half a
dozen languages, even in Hungarian, for one
never kn. w whence the call to kingship
would come. Thrones might spring up or
fall vacant anywhere. One must be ready to
pounce.” He pounced—upon Bulgaria.
Another interesting biography is that of
Karl Liebknecht, the leader of the German
Socialists —the other king in Potsdam. “There
is the Kaiser who reviews his legions on the
parade ground before the Old Palace, and
there is Karl Liebkneeht who gathers his
legions in the streets. His election to the
Reichstag as the Socialist representative of
the Kaiser’s own borough in 1912 was the
most bitter insult the Kaiser ever received
from his people. It was as though Windsor
had returned a Republican to Parliament.
The Kaiser’s sons ostentatiously led the way
to the polling booth in the early morning, but
at night the people of Potsdam had elected
Karl Liebkneeht as their democratic king.”
He is too powerful to be constrained. A. G.
Gardiner sees in him “the symbol of the Ger-
many with whom we are going to be recon-
ciled.” Again and again he has made his
protest against the war —and the Kaiser
dare not touch him.
At this moment, however, the character
sketch of Venizelos, the Greek, will attract
more attention. One wonders whether the
Allies will confirm the statement that Veni-
zelos is still “the greatest statesman in
Europe to-day.” It was in all probability
due to a too great dependence on Venizelos’
word that the disastrous naval attack on the
Dardanelles was initiated. A statesman of
his calibre ought to have known the strength
of the forces organised by the Greek Court
against him. History will put the blame
either upon the organiser of that desperate
adventure for too great a trust in Venizelos,
or on Venizelos for too great a trust in his
own power.
Gallipoli Bill, Author
He is still writing, the bloke outback in
Gallipoli, still winning his literary laurels.
A correspondent forwards some examples of
Bill’s capacity for graphic expression, all
taken from Australian soldiers' letters:—•
“He was that excited that his eyes stuck
out far enough for a fowl to roost on them.”
—Pvt. Ludermann (Bendigo).
Pvt. W. liyan (Molong), of shrapnel:
“It’s just like throwing a dishful of rice at
a man. You would have thought a fly
couldn’t have lived there. The 'bullets were
so thick. .. .If there had been another one
in the air, they’d have jammed.”
“Put our fellows into Hell, and they will
clean up the joint first and fight their way
out again.”—Pvt. B. Ashton (Coalville).
Thus spake a private to an officer who
shot dead at close charging Turk:
“What in Hell did you do that for? I could
have shot him five minutes ago, but I
wanted to harpoon the cow!”
Corp. Dibley (Sydney) : “With the dawn
came Lizzie’s deep contralto... .In a little
while we heard a report like a thousand
thunder-claps rolled into one. It was only
Lizzie sounding a low B.”
Pvt. R. L. Houston (Bendigo), under fire:
“My teeth vVere playing ‘Home, Sweet
Home,’ with variations, and my nerves were
jumping like a Morse code apparatus.”
Sergeant W. Trott (Manly), in hospital:
“The doctor called two nurses to have a
look at a narrow escape. I was the narrow
escape.”
Corp. W. V. Gray (Parkville) tells of a
comrade at the great landing: “He jumped
out before the boat landed, and as he floun-
dered ashore he was heard to gurgle: ‘Well,
here’s a blooming submarine at them, any-
how !”
According to a British officer an Indian
trooper thus indicated the difference between
Briton and Australian: “When shrapneL
comes along, an Englishman will duck and
get. in a dug-out; but an Australian will
turn round and say, ‘Who in Hell threw that
thing ?’ ”
•
“Jack Spur” on flappers, literature and
bishops :
Keel Page fiction reviewers do the short-skirted
section an injustice in calling the Garvice brand of
story Flapperature. The present writer reckons he
knows as many flappers as the next man, and never
knew one yet who entertained any illusions con-
cerning Charles or his imitators. While home on a
recent furlough I was surprised to find baby sister
(aged 17) tackling Bergson. We do not claim to be
an exceptional crowd, and there are no geniuses on
the distaff side of the family. Bergson had been intro-
duced to her by a more sophisticated schoolmate as
“a writer one really ought to know.” At least a
dozen flappers qf my acquaintance know Cannan
but not Corelli, and could pass a searching exami-
nation on G. B. Shaw, Pinero and Barrie. The
spread of secondary education and the popularity of
the repertory theatre have improved Miss Pigtail’s
taste for reading matter. When she is not conning
French verbs and botany she gets busy on H. G.
Wells or Shaw, Anne Veronica and Arms and the
Man being hot favorites.
Any bookseller will tell you that Action of the
mildly-naughty type is rushed by middle-aged
matrons who would blush at the mention of Dean
Swift or Rabelais. From personal observations I
should say that commercial travellers and jockeys
are the greatest readers of the gospel according to
Garvice. When the barmaid has time to open a
book it is generally something by Dickens or Hugo’s
latest.
While on a recent train journey my fellow travel-
lers were a bishop, a bookmaker and three commer-
cials. The following publications were visible to
the naked eye. The bishop and one of the commer-
cials were devouring magazines. So was I. Another
commercial was being edified by Nat Gould. The
rest had newspapers. It was a long, tedious trip,
and, after a couple of hours had dawdled by, the
bishop yawned, indulged in a polite commonplace,
and swapped a brand-new Sthand Magazine for the
well-thumbed, dog-eared Nat Gould.

“There is no need to tell people who
saw me two years ago of the
wonderful results of
Clements
Tonic”
Mrs. Mary Ethel Hoare, wife of the
officer in charge of the Police
Station, Guildford, N.S.W., writes of
her recovery:
Police Stajtion,
Guildford, N.S.W., 2/l/’l5.
“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful
that I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass without
letting you know for the benefit of other people the wonderful
results of Clements Tonic.
“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. I would shake all
over.
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
try Clements Tonic.
“There is no need to tell people who saw me two years
ago, and who can see me now, of the wonderful results of
Clements Tonic, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after I had taken six bottles I WAS RESTORED
TO MY PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.
“You are at perfect liberty to make what use you think fit
of this. AS I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
CLEMENTS TONIC AND WHAT IT WILL DO FOR THEM.”

A Great REMEDY for
BLADDER TROUBLE.
Drinking water that is of bad quality or
too soft often causes bladder trouble. Every
sufferer tortured with the agonising burning
pains of bladder inflammation (cystitis)
should try a harmless remedy which gives
relief in ninety-nine cases out of every hun-
dred in a way that can only be described as
miraculous.
This torture and pain is caused through
germs in the bladder. De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills contain a very strong,
yet marvellously soothing antiseptic, which

penetrates the diseased tissues, attacks and
destroys the germs, makes the urine after a
time bright and clean, bringing a wonderful,
quick sense of relief and ease.
If you are troubled with rheumatism,
gout, gravel, backache, tired feeling, dropsy,
Bright’s disease, constipation, cloudy urine,
inflammation of the bladder, or other
symptoms of urinary trouble you should
give this wonderful remedy a trial imme-
diately, because it brings quick relief, almost
every time—guaranteed—and a sure cure
follows in most cases.
To cure rheumatism or any other form
of kidney trouble you must positively get
rid of the cause—the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. S\ hen you see the urine change
to a muddy bluish color—a feature which
distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing touch
on the right spot—the kidneys and the
bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the
kidneys—that is why De Witt’s Pills give
such amazingly quick relief —every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case. Look for that blue-colored urine.

The Road to Waverley.
Noise and dust by night and day ;
Running ever towards the sea;
Overlooking beach and bay—
That’s the road to Waverley.
Often ’neath the noonday sky,
While all life works tirelessly,
Plumed funerals go by,
On the road to Waverley.
Tread whatever road you may,
You and I, sometime to be,
We shall take the silent way—
Pass the road to Waverley.
Then we shall no more awake,
See no more as now we see.
As full length at peace we take
The long road to Waverley.
Tread whatever road we may,
Let us face it joyously,
Noon of day, or end of day,
The long road to Waverley.

The Magic Rose.
With sweets of lavender and musk,
The petals drifting through the dusk,
Make me an amber rosary.
And you, a soft-toned penitent.
Whose prayers, with the faint perfume blent,
Whisper of secret sins to me.
Sins? Yet I see your foam-white feet
Stainless beneath the winding-sheet
Which folds around them tenderly.
Love leads you down the shining hills
Where tender Silence, list’ning, thrills
With soundless magic melody.
He leads you to a silver plain
Encinctured with a rose-wrought chain,
So that, while bound, you yet are frt
He weaves the sunlight in your hair,
Crowns it with stars and blossoms fair—
All part of Youth’s first ecstasy.
And dark-winged Doubt before you flies,
Love lightens so your dewy eyes,
She feareth their sweet mystery.
Hope from her harp draws songs of these,
Sad Nicolette, sweet Heloise,
The while you listen dreamily.
Ah ! Unforgotten dawn of gold !
Wisdom, nor wealth, nor precept cold
Can ever bring you back to me!
Night broods upon the grey-leaved trees,
Crooning sad dirges to the breeze,
Dimming the path of Phantasy.
Past is the dream! The petals shed
Are crimson where my heart has bled.
Pain stoops and gathers them for me.

The Joy Riders.
True, Mary Jane, you do not sport Milady's
silk and fur,
And yet for us the lights whiz by—a glorious
silver blur!
The night wind riots through your curls,
and screeches in our ears;
But w r e, my girl, with'hearts a-whirl, are
done with frets and fears.
In yonder park old Moneygrub lives in a
mansion white ;
But, Mary Jane, he seeks in vain, this blood-
red surge of life!
Wealth, and the things that wealth can
bring, are his ; and yet they cloy—
He's never felt, for all his wealth, this
splendid hour of joy!
Milady’s robes are not for you; no gems
gleam in your hair;
And yet I vow she is not now as fair as
you are fair !
When Cornucopia gave largess a blank, girl,
was your prize :
What matter, dear? Enough to peer into
your wondrous eyes !
Enough for me to have you sit close-
snuggled by my side
What time we in old Moneygrub’s luxurious
auto ride;
Enough for me to hear your voice, and see
your teeth of pearl—
What counts the ban if I’m liis man, and
you his servant girl!
Ah, fain would Madam be as you, to feel
the joys we feel
When Beauty smiles a-down the miles, and
Love is at the wheel.
And fain would Madam’s husband give his
money and his might
To glimpse as we the witchery that we have
passed to-night;
To feel the freedom that we feel, and know
the things we know ;
To taste the spice of Paradise in all the
winds that blow;
To see the tints we see around, the silver
and the gold—
Ah, could he, he’d he sorrow-freed, yes, freed
a thousand-fold.
To-night, sweetheart, this car is like some
wild, exultant thing;
Now watch me graze this post (like that!)
and round this corner swing;
Now twig the trees merge into one, and
hear the breezes hiss—
And yet despite our breathless flight we
still have time to kiss!
What roads shall flash beneath to-night?
What dangers shall we dare?
I do not know (a bump, what-oh!) —and
neither do I care!
For this is Joy’s own sacred hour, with
nought our path to bar—
God bless the portly toff who bought this
thousand-guinea car!

BRITAIN’S PRIME MINISTER FLOGS
HIS OWN JOSS.
Asquith gives the whole show away with
this admission :
Voluntaryism is well enough in time of peace, but
it operates in a haphazard, capricious and unjust way
in time of war.
And that is the beginning, the middle and
the end of iff —an appropriate inscription
for the tombstone. Asquith, a life-long-
supporter of the system, could not have
damned it more effectively had he used a
thousand words instead of a score. He
kicks away the last conceivable justifica-
tion for allowing the defence of a nation to
depend upon the eleventh-hour effort of an
untrained multitude.
* * * *
Of course voluntaryism is good enough
when the life of the nation is not at stake,
or when it. is only engaged in such enter-
prises as demand a limited force, or has. to
supply a guard of honor for a visiting-
potentate. Any old army does then. In
the same way, when a man is living in a
remote part of the country, uninhabited by
burglars, it is not necessary for him to have
a policeman on the beat. But when that
citizen comes to town he finds that in the
multitude of John Hobs there is safety for
his watch and his hat and his purse; and
when his premises are raided and his furni-
ture carried off, his goods are torn
away from the thieves, if the protective
force can get there quick enough, and the
criminals are thrown into prison. Unless
this citizen is a blithering lunatic he doesn’t
write to the newspapers complaining that
he has been spared from suffering serious
loss because the State has taken at least
reasonable precautions to protect its law-
abiding inhabitants against attack by those
who covet their neighbor’s ox and ass and
everything that is his. Nor if flames break
out in his house does the sane citizen rise
in revolt against the fire brigade which
dashes up with 15 hoses and squirts cold
water through the windows and drags him
out of bed and slides down a ladder with
him hanging over its shoulder. The only
test of protective agencies, whether they, be
armies or navies or John Hops or fire-
brigades, is their effectiveness to do some-
thing sudden and decisive when they are
wanted. An umbrella with one rib and a
rent covering may be useful as a walking-
stick on a fine evening, but in a cloud-burst
it is about as handy as a pineapple.
* * * *
To say that a military system is hap-
hazard, capricious and unjust in time of war
is merely a polite way of remarking that
the thing is hideously dangerous. Armies
are wanted for war, not for peace, and to
go on clinging to what is haphazard in
organising for defence is no more sensible
than it would be to resist the employment
of long-range ordnance and high-explosive
shells, in order to have the privilege <>f
assailing the enemy with bows and arrows.
For a century John Bull has been encour-
aged by the peculiar circumstances associ-
ated with his insular position and liis un-
challenged naval ascendancy to regard the
maintenance of voluntary service in the
army as one of the props of the Constitu-
tion. Opposition to national service became
with him a cult. As he got along fairly
well without it the idea became fastened
in bis mind that he owed his liberties
and his progress and all the rest of
it to freedom from “compulsion”—that his
navy would guard him against invasion
and keep the seas open to his commerce,
and that the army which was strong enough
for what was doing when Wellington
fought in Spain would rise triumphant over
any call that could possibly be made upon
its devotion at any time soever. The delu-
sion has been systematically nurtured by
Splendid Isolationists like Gladstone, and
pacificists like Bright and visionaries like
Cobden ; it received encouragement from
commercial and financial interests, German
and otherwise; it became embedded in the
doctrines of every political party—in that of
the Conservatives because, for one thing,
they regarded a career in the army as the
special privilege of the wealthy ; in that of
the Liberals because they imagined military
weakness to be the complement of Freetrade;
and in that of the Radicals because to them
“conscription” savored of oppression. So
universal service became a thing to be jeered
at, to be intolerantly rejected by public meet-
ings at Peckham Rye as “un-English,” and
“our splendid volunteer system” developed
into a catchcry—vain and futile as all such
phrases are—not because that system would
stand the only test by which it should be
judged, nor even because it embodied an
expression of intelligent principle, but
because the people had been bemused by a
false reading of history and by unsound
judgments on the course of contemporary
events.
From the argument always advanced by
philosophic exponents of the virtues of the
voluntary system—that a large army was a
danger to the people from whom it was drawn
because it could be made an instrument
of Jingo adventure, conquest and oppression
in the hands of unscrupulous rulers and
Parliaments —two gross errors stand up like
lamp-posts. One is that the argument
ignores what is going to happen to the
nation against which this instrument is
turned by another; the second is that, when
applied to a democracy, the meaning of the
argument is that the democracy cannot trust
itself. .In Germany the military strength of the
nation lias been prostituted, and the nation
turned into an international house-
breaker. But it has not been so in France,
nor in Russia, nor Italy nor Servia. By
those countries the men of the nation are
standing up against a brigand, and had they
not been Teady to do it—had they depended
on the system described by Asquith as
“haphazard”—the brigand would have won.
John Bull is merely learning to-day a lesson
that has been taught to the world ever since
the first man set out with a club —that
what a nation has it must be ready to de-
fend by force. Unless it is ready, then,
sooner or later, an attempt will be made to
employ force against it. From this comes
the inescapable conclusion that participation
in defence must be a duty of citizenship—
that every man must be prepared to defend
his country, the liberties of his race and the
freedom of his children. The only alterna-
tives to that are to let things slide or to do
the best that can be done by inviting people
to come along at the last minute and take
lessons in shooting when the enemy is
climbing over the back fence. That is
what John Bull has been doing. And now
it is no longer a matter of being excessively
proud of it, but of wondering just how
much longer dependence for life is going to
rest on a farce that worked with great suc-
cess when no one’s skin was in danger.
According to Asquith it ought to continue
about five minutes. According to a num-
ber of dreary dodderers it should be kept
going—through injustice and unnecessary
suffering A-to the bitter, wretched end.
WAR AND MORALS.
An Adelaide parson of the uttermost
respectability has ventured to echo the sug-
gestion of English scientists that the present
upheaval must make a big difference in con-
ventional morality. And that means all
morality, for all morality is conventional.
In one country the most blameless woman
will go about in public bare above the waist;
in another such an action would be out of
bounds to the most degraded. In one coun-
try a man with four wives is perfectly
moral, because law and custom favor that
extravagance; in another he would be a
monster of iniquity, because they don’t favor
it- —though if the law and custom of that
country happened to change he would be as
moral as the other man. Some of the most
popular characters in history—. Jacob, for
instance, and David —had more than one
wife at a time, and nobody thinks of blam-
ing them. Our own conventional morality
admits its folly when it rules that, of two
people coinbining to have a child without
any marriage ceremony, the man is excus-
able but the woman isn’t. It could
without any great, shock change its capri-
cious mind and say that she also is excus-
able ; and signs are not wanting that this is
what it is going to do.
* * * *
Population is the crying need of the stir-
ring age we are thrown in. If this war be-
comes, one of exhaustion, the side that can
heave'the final half-million men into the gap
will w T in; and the nation —presumably
Russia —that has a spare million or two 20
years hence will be able to talk pretty con-
fidently to its less heavily populated neigh-
bors. And how is even the normal growth of
population going to be kept up in an age
when a completely abnormal growth is
demanded? The marriageable men are
being killed every day. The marriageable
women are not. Australia and .England and
Russia will notice a disproportion. In Ger-
many and France and Belgium the dispro-
Dortion will be staggering. With strict
monogamy still enforced, millions —-literally
millions —of splendid women now just grow-
ing up must go unmated. That is, as the
Adelaide parson suggested, they must, for
no fault of their own, lose the full meaning
of their womanhood; also the nations they
belong to must lose their enormously valu-
able potentialities as repairers of the waste
caused by war.
Well, what is going to be done about it?
»So far as Nature decrees, there might be
50 women for every one man, and still the
next generation need not run short. To
run counter to the conventional morality of
centuries is hard work, all the same. The
first thing would be to cease to make the
unmarried mother feel herself in any way
outside the pale. Europe is rapidly taking
that step. It already encourages her to
declare herself a victim of the horrors of
war —which may or may not be true in any
given case—and presently, in its gratitude
to her for helping to enrich her country, it
will not trouble to ask any questions at
all. In Australia she has only to say that
the father of her child has been killed at
Gallipoli to gain a kindly sympathy which
would have been utterly lacking a year or
two back. The maternity bonus has already
in Australia ceased to be a joke and become
a plain business question. As other nations
adopt it, they can and will increase it im-
mensely. Comfortable and perfectly ap-
pointed and free maternity hospitals follow
as a matter of course, with a continuing
provision for the child as ward of the State.
The one really difficult step is that at start-
ing.
* * * *
In any case, it is all merely a phase that
will pass. The children who are growing
up. and the children hereafter to be born,
will balance in the matter of sex as hereto-
fore. In 25 years or so the discrepancy that
will immediately follow the war will cease
to be of importance. The business during
that time will be to see that the healthy
women now aged from 15 to 40 do not —as
they otherwise must—live their lives un-
mated ; to see that the time when births are
of unusual importance shall not be just the
time when births become scarce. It will Ife
work for statesmen who can defy the wow-
ser and think of the country’s good; and it
will be most interesting to see how they will
set about it —in Belgium !
THE SHAKEN FAITH OF THE SMALL
NATIONS.
In spite of the small and shuddering gleam
which Asquith’s speech lias shed on
the national darkness, there is a
decently optimistic view which can rea-
sonably be taken of the situation. In
the face of a big, dangerous enemy
who has thus far had more successes than
reverses, a. British Prime Minister can still
openly acknowledge his mistakes, boldly
claim the responsibility for them, and declare
that he will stick at nothing to bring the
big fellow at. last to the dust. The absence
of apology, cringe or special pleading on the
part of those who are doing the muddling
through is worth something, and it may yet
prove to be worth a great deal. The
temper of all the British peoples is such
that no failure on the part of frank and
honest leaders will entirely discourage them.
Tied by cords of antique superstition and
dragging after her weighty chains of custom,
England has little freedom uf movement; and
taking this into full account her organising
efforts of the last 12 months have been re-
markable. That those organising efforts
should have been made 20 years late, and
that they are even to-day incomplete, cannot
wholly destroy their effectiveness; and it is
at least even-chances that enough has been
done up-to-date to keep the ITell-broth of
battle boiling while the completed national
effort is being made. The history of the
past goes to show that a Britain heartily
walloped, or at least stung by partial defeat,
has produced a Britain strong and deter-
mined and capable; and there is at least a
decent chance that history will repeat itself
in the present instance.
* * * *
But it must be Britain, and not France or
Russia, that wins out if her national prestige
is to remain when the last shell bangs into
a discomfited and broken foe. Fifteen months
ago Belgium, in an agony of surprise for the
thing that had burst upon her, called to Eng-
land for aid. England, true to her treaty
obligations and her traditions, sent a force;
but it was utterly inadequate, and it was sent
too late. The war with its chances and changes
boomed on through months of pain and
death, and then Servia, in more insistent and
heartbroken tones, called from her hungry
hills for British help. Taught by ex-
perience in the case of Belgium, British
statesmen responded to the appeal with a
result that cannot yet be known; but all the.
present indications are that the help sent is
insufficient, and that once more it lias been
dispatched too late. Should English forces
in the Balkans redeem the situation and
march through triumphantly to the Danube
the lesson of the opening stages of the war
will have been well learned ; but should the
southern European campaign resolve itself
into a repetition of the stalemate of the
western Front, the world’s faith in England
will have been shaken to such an extent that
Avliile her failures may be atoned for they
can never be altogether forgiven. No national
crime can be greater than that of encourag-
ing small and weak peoples to put their
trust in the orotection of a Power which will
not make adequate sacrifices to ensure that
protection being effective. * ,
All present indications point to the fact
that Britain with the assistance of heY Allies
will muddle through. The Germans are
held securely enough on the west; winter
fights with the Russians on the east; hunger
bites in Berlin; Italy keeps a lot of Aus-
trians busy in the Trentino and elsewhere.
The one big German chance is a histrionic
display at the gates of Constantinople. But
the Kaiser would much rather hear Asquith
declare in the name of both British political
parties that there would be no conscription
under any circumstances than enter those
historic portals. With her whole available
male population under arms England will
more than merely win. Berlin knows this quite
as well as it knows the price of sausaged
war-horse. But the delay fights the Teuton
battle and helps the Kaiser to dream of a
peace made by the Pope and Woodrow
Wilson in which lie may still masquerade
as a world conqueror. Asquith’s speech
makes it plain that the temper of England
is all right. Whether the war lasts one year
or 17 England will nmadle through. But
there is nothing to indicate how long it
will take to mop up the remembrance of the
blood spilled in Belgium and Servia which
might never have been spilled if Britain had
drilled her manhood in the cause of peace.
One thing is certain. In the better days
to come, when the guns are quiet and men
look hack at the record of things done in
Cabinet and field, the person who mentions
the British habit of muudling through as if
it were a national virtue will deserve to
have a brick thrown at him without warning
or explanation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Peaceful Arrangement to Mark Time.
Partly because the thing had been badly
stage-managed and the progress of the war
has not been according to schedule, but
mainly because the r chances of securing a
favorable verdict were unpleasantly blue,
Commonwealth Prime Minister Hughes
looked for a soft place to fall on, and the
party behind him was just as anxious as
he to save its face. Therefore it happens
that a method of procedure, previously
rejected because of its inadequacy, has been
agreed to by the Federal .Government: the
Referenda proposals have been withdrawn,
and the Commonwealth, if all goes well, will
by the grace of the States get for the period of
the war'and a year afterwards a substantial
part of the powers asked for under the sug-
gested constitutional amendments. From
llolman and Joe Cook and the S. M.
Herald and others baskets of flowers have
been handed up to Hughes, and from the
serried ranks of Lib. and Lab. has come
a chorus : “Thank God, that’s over, anyhow !”
Twelve months after the Great Disturbance
has ceased the old job will be waiting for
someone to tackle afresh. Meanwhile the
Commonwealth will, for “the purposes of
carrying on the war,” have a wider
authority. But it is only partially true that
the powers to be conferred were wanted
for this purpose. The Referenda proposals
arose out of conditions associated with
peace, and it is impossible to see; how that,
so far as the purely w r ar activities of the
Commonwealth are concerned, these.extended
powers are going to be of tremendous
material value! The merit about*'them in
their original form was that they contem-
plated a permanent limitation, of State
powers, and represented a step towards the
establishment of One sovereign authority in
the government of Australia. In this direc-
tion the advance now achieved, pending sub-
sequent retreat, represents about half an
inch, and this paper is much too tired of
such piffling substitutes for Unification to
join in the hymn of joy raised by party bar-
rackers of, every brand over the great achieve-
ment.

Munitions of War.
The enormous Russian demand for muni-
tions of war is said to be absorbing all the
skilled labor of Japan. Already in Europe
every mechanic who can turn his hand to
the job of making shells or guns is working
Groan, Brother, Groan!
(Dedtrnted in any and every persinist.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Groan, Brother! Groan your dismal song
Of wrack and ruin and schemes gone wrong!
Look out, look down, with a bilious eye
And con the world with your brain awry!
Never a spark of hope you see
For poor, deluded humanity!
Your wearisome croak is heard all day
Of debts and devils we’ve got to pay.
The past is dead and the future’s black,
And the walls of Heaven begin to crack!
Groan, Brother! Groan, if Groan you must,
Till worlds stop spinning and white stars
bust,
And the molten yolk of each one pours
Line red egg-meat on Hell’s sizzling floors!
Groan till angels on wings of cloud
With joys of Heaven come bent and bowed,
And the fairest of all, as in air she stands,
Takes your crying soul in her lilied hands
And bears it away to the Central Throne.
(Oh yes, dear brother, in Heaven we’ll

Groan, Brother! Groan! The Halls of
Grace
Are doubtless a very draughty place;
The tremulous throb of golden harps,
Sounding their numberless flats and sharps,
Will tear at your nerves till, cold and lone,
You utter a most tremendous Groan,
And a senior angel from afar
Flies like a racing motor-car —
Soars like a bird and drops like a stone
To find who uttered the Heavenly Groan.
Groan, Brother !. Groan ! ’Tis your employ
And pessimism’s your only joy!
Groan for the follies and faults of men
And when you’re dead you will Groan again!
Groan in Heaven and Groan in Hell
Till Satan watches his hot tail swell,
And devils sit by their fires asleep,
And angels droop at their harps and

Misery! Misery! Slcin and hone!
What laugh contents like a hearty Groan!

EXTRA AND SPECIAL ISSUE.
The Ordinary Issue of The Bulletin
will be published on the usual date.
overtime. The enormous quantity of war
material required was one of the surprises
or the present struggle. Germany may not
have been taken unawares, but certainly the
other nations had no idea that anything like
so much fireworks would be required. A
sufficient supply of munitions of war to
guarantee peace will be one of the problems
of the future, and with the invention of new
and improved weapons this, rather than the
number of men in an army, may come to be
regarded as the index of a people’s strength.
But here the difficulty arises that munitions
of war are by reason of those very inven-
tions particularly had stock. Not the muni-
tions, but the skilled men and intelligent
machinery to make them, must therefore be
the first consideration. Australia will be wise
to learn this in time. Her citizen army, being
necessarily limited in size, even if increased
to its true dimensions by taking in every
able-bodied man who can hold a gun, must
be doubly well supplied with things to throw
at the enemy. As these cannot be made in
large supply beforehand without locking up
national capital in material which a bril-
liant idea of an inventor may render obso-
lete, it follows that they must be stored in
the skilled fingers and trained brains of our
mechanics. Let every lad on being apnren-
ticed to one. of the engineering trades have
included in his training a certain period
spent in munition-making workshops. Let
every chemist be compelled to pass a prac-
tical examination in the compounding of
explosives. Let no tailor be allowed the
full rate of trade wages unless lie has
learned to satisfactorily make a military
uniform. Carry out the. same idea in every
calling and keep the general machinery
handy, and then when llie war-gong clangs
an army of workers can take its place
behind the armies in the field, and the nation
can rest in confidence that war supplies
will be fully forthcoming when needed. This
is no more than Germany did. It is less, in
fact; for every German workshop, on the
outbreak of any war, automatically stopped
its ordinary job and turned to the particular
national work to which it had been allotted.
The other way is to leave things to chance
and throw a jam-tin and a sheep’s head at
the enemy before going out to challenge him
with a crowbar.

National Waste.
Thus William Cokin, Chief Electrical
Engineer in the Public Works Department
of N. S. Wales, concerning only one item in
the appalling waste that proceeds in Aus-
tralia -
Last year 304,800 tons of coke were manufactured
in N. S. Wales, of which 252,409 tons were made
on the Southern coalfields. At the new iron and
steel works belonging to the B. H. Proprietary, at
Port Waratah, 66 by-product ovens have been
erected, and other examples of by-product recovery
exist in the Northern district; but so far as the
South is concerned, with one exception, viz., the
Oorriinal mine, the whole of the coke-oven gas is
wasted, and in no case is any attempt made to
recover the valuable by-products. If coke-ovens were
elected on a suitable site, with plant for the
recovery of ammonia and tar, and possibly benzine,
toluol, cyanide and other by-products, the whole of
the South Coast coke could be produced therefrom,
and in addition there would be available from the
gas no less than 140 million units, which, if the
industry be regarded as a whole, and the by-pro-
ducts be sold at market rates, could be supplied for
less than a farthing per unit delivered. It need
scarcely be pointed out that ammonia is being in-
creasingly required for refrigeration; that sulphate
of ammonia is a valuable fertiliser (and, though
more would be produced than is required at present
in this country, its export would add to the material
wealth of the State) ; that the large quantity of tar
resulting would enable a supply to be furnished at
low rates for improving the roads of the State ; and
that there is likely to .be a large demand for toluol
for the manufacture of tri-nitro-toluol (T.N.T.), if,
as seems probable, Australia relies upon herself for
her future supplies of explosives. Confidential figures
have been supplied by several British coke-oven
owners, showing conclusively the great profits which
are being made from this industry. This is evi-
denced by the increasing number of coke ovens with
recovery plants which are being employed in all
parts of the world. The four chief firms supplying
these plants within recent years constructed, up to
and including the year 1913, no less than 6540 ovens
in Great Britain and Ireland, of which 2662 were
constructed since the year 1908. One firm alone had
constructed, from 1902-1912 inclusive, 5088 ovens
in Germany, 1507 in the United States, and 1370 in
England.
When those who talk most about “national
economy” mention the subject they are three
times out of four thinking that somebody or
other ought to spend a shilling or two a week
less on beer or tobacco or jam or millinery
or something-. But if the things that are
wasted in this richest country in the world
wore used, there wouldn’t be any need for
the population to cut out a tin of jam or a
new hat. There is, in fact, enough going-
over the dump in Australia to buy a lot of
extra jam and quite two more hats.

Some French Naval History, with an
Australian Application.
As there is a lot of thoroughly well-deserved
admiration about for France, the French, and
French methods generally, perhaps the time
may be considered more or less matured for
imitation of a comparatively recent French
reform. After the war of 1870-71 the French
navy and its dockyards became a sort of
freak or toy for the politicians and “groups”
to play 'with. The inevitable result was that
the fleet became a collection of marine
curios, while the dockyards were turned into
extremely comfortable semi-charitable insti-
tutions wherein the Government super-stroke
flourished like the green absinthe-tree. While
John Bull was putting his pre-Dread-
noughts into commission 80 months from the
time of laying the keels,' and' while the Ger-
man Michael was doing almost as well, the
-average French battleship built in the Gov-
ernment yards was found to take seven
years to complete. In fact, ships of the
. Charles Martel class took nearly nine
years to send to sea. France, of course, in
‘the ’Bo’s' and ’9o’s was full of troubles,
scandals, “reorganisations,” war-scares and
Dreyfus cases, and consequently nobody
bothered much about the fleet, which became
the Cinderella of the nation. Then, in
1900, came the German Navy Law and the
Kaiser’s welt-macht speeches. What, pri-
marily, was a challenge to England was seen
by the logical and brainy French to be
equally a menace to them. They had
definitely abandoned the idea of naval com-
petition with Britain, but their traditions
and their interests alike forbade them meekly
to acquiesce in playing third fiddle when
they had so long played second. In 1908-9
by which year the Mailed Fist had really
commenced to make a splash in the North
Sea —the French were seriously studying
the position. Even with the Inscription
Maritime (introduced by the great Colbert
in 1009), it was found that the country was
paying about £15,000,000 a year for what
Delcasse described as “a naval menagerie.” A
special Commission was appointed to inquire
into things, and its conclusions, in the form
of a report of 220 pages, and 730 pages of
evidence, so shook the Government that the
Minister for Marine was promptly jettisoned,
and France’s best sailor, Admiral Boue de
Lapeyrere, was put at the head of the De-
partment and given almost limitless powers.
As a result of De Lapeyrere's efforts France
has now quite a respectable and efficient
fleet, which at the close of the war will pro-
bably rank in its old place. This ancient —
yet not-so-very-ancient—history has an Aus-
tralian application. The French Parlia-
mentary Commission reported, inter alia.
that once a ship had been authorised, instead
of the dockyard getting promptly and ener-
getically to work upon the job, endless alter-
ations and modifications were made in the
plans by all the faddists on deck. (As at
Cockatoo Dock, N.S.W.) Again, the Com-
mission pointed out “that the yards were
not in a state to carry out with rapidity new
construction and repairs.” (Just as at
Cockatoo.) Also, “the plant and mechanical
equipment were in general inadequate and
out of date” (the same as at Cockatoo).
Furthermore, “the abolition of piecework,
which had coincided with a reduction of
working hours -and the diminution of the
powers and authority of the superinten-
dents in chargej had resulted in an alarming
lessening of production.” (Ditto at Cocka-
too.) In addition, “lack of material some-
times caused-a stoppage of work.” (Precisely
as., at Cockatoo.) And the Commission
recommended (and the recommendation was
acted upon) “that there be an immediate re-
introduction of piecework, distributed and
remunerated in an equitable manner,”. . . .
while “the authority of the foremen and
heads of departments should be strengthened
by increasing their power of dispensing pro-
motion, rewards and punishments.” All of
this applies most closely to the awful institu-
tion alleged to be run by the Commonwealth
Government at Sydney. Australia can have
one of two things. She can have (1) Cocka-
tooism as it is at present and an expensive
and futile and out-of-date fleet: or (2) no
Cockatooism and a fleet worthy of her
ambitions.

Towser.
“Carfax” reports the decline and fall of
Towser: —
He was one of tlic bulldog breed, lean and hungry to
look at, and bearing many scars. But he carried Ins
head aloft, and his roving eye looked so balefully
at the cat that Thomas slunk away. And there was
no droop in the tyke’s tail.
“D'yer want a pup, boss?” asked the tattered
pirate who alleged he was the owner. Well, 1
didn’t, but it struck me that that brute of Samp-
son’s next door was getting a bit of a nuisance; so
Towser changed hands there at the back door.
He had been reared in a hard school, had Towser,
having apparently been left to shift .for himself at
the earliest age. Feeding him was at first unneces-
sary. He preferred the larcenous meals of a high-
wayman. On the morning after his arrival on the
premises the butcher drove up to deliver a pound
of chops. Being in a respectable neighborhood
and a quiet street, he left the tailboard of his cart
down. Towser, entrenched behind a rosebush, ad-
vanced silently to the banquet and bore off two or
three feet of choice steak. The butcher was still
wondering where that steak went when, three days
later, he hurried back to his cart and detected
Towser attached to a leg of mutton. That cost me
ss. 6d.
Next evening Towser was enjoying a bone when
Sampson's tvke appeared for the first time —a big,
hairy animal which had vanquished everything on
four legs in the district. “Ha ! a bone. Right into
my hands!” and he proceeded to the act of appro-
priation. It was a meatless bone, too. But as
the stranger drew close Towser’s teeth were bared
across the prize, and an ominous growl warned the
district robber that if he wanted that bone he would
have to fight for it. And fight they did —a sharp,
desperate battle from which a black dog, with
torn throat and bleeding ear, vanished, into Samp-
son's, howling with agony and surprise. The inci-
dent led to a very marked coldness between my wife
and Mrs. Sampson, who had known each other for
40 years. Sampson’s dog kept within Sampson’s
frontier for the rest of his days, and died eventually
of dropsy.
For a long time Towser fought every dog that
appeared in our street. Some he openly challenged
to combat and advanced upon with threatening noise.
These were generally dogs of obese habit of body—-
fat, waddling dogs that were short in the wind and
accompanied ladies on afternoon-tea expeditions. On
these occasions the discreet suburban air was filled
by the squeaks of old lady dog-owners and the
frantic yelps of vanquished poodles. The other sort
of dog—the one that looked like a snag or one hav-
ing a punch about it; the kind young boys are fond
of taking exercise with—found themselves up against
it all of a sudden, so to speak. There was no pre-
liminary declaration of war. Towser would hurl
himself at them from the rear without remark and
get to work with the silent resolution of a cracks-
man. He was lord , of the street and all the neigh-
boring lanes, the terror of kids and old maids and
corpulent old gentlemen ; a brazen thief who got away
with ham bones and sausages from adjacent sculleries
and drove all the cats to permanent habitation on
the tiles.
In- time, however, I began to notice that Towser’s
circumference was increasing. He became fond of
dozing in the sun, of leaving a bone With meat on
it outside his kennel while he slumbered between
chews. One warm evening a strange little tyke hap-
pened into the yard to explore the rubbish tin, and,
seeing a bone near a sleeping clog, went to try his
luck. He had home too soon. But the fight was
quite interesting, and, though the prospector of rub-
bish tins retreated, he .did so. with his tail pointing
to the stars. Towser was out of breath, and his tail
pointed the other way. He went into his kennel and
slept. .
It was not long afterwards that Bn, no came round
with rabbits, and, stalking behind him, a wicked-
looking brute with a spotted hide and a heavy head,
hungry and gaunt. I had just placed before Towser
the usual dish of assorted meats and very nice gravy,
and he was about to pick out the best-looking piece,
when with a growling bound the rabbit-o’s pup
shoved an unlovely-looking face into his own. Tow-
ser drew back with a snarl, then a whimper, and
leaped for his kennel! And as he looked out he
saw a long red tongue gratefully lick the dish that
was his. Towser had joined the Peace Society.
The fleas are thoroughly satisfied.
An Experiment that Was Squashed in
the Egg.
Tasmania’s attempt to abolish party war-
fare during the Great Disturbance has ended
disappointingly. The Assembly agreed,
almost unanimously, to postpone the general
elections for a year, three members of the
Opposition (Lee, Lewis and Evans) to act
in a consultative capacity with the Earle
Ministry. The parties pledged themselves
to stick to the agreement for six months,
whatever happened ; but if the pact proved
unworkable either party might then end it by
giving the other side a month’s notice. It
would have been an interesting experiment,
but the Last Say Chamber, furious at its
“Liberal” allies in the Assembly even sug-
gesting an armistice with the hated Labor
Government, flung the proposal out even more
unanimously than the Assembly had agreed
to it. Then the Assembly Libs, promptly
handed a no-confidence motion to John
Earle, and the discussion thereon is now
raging as violently as party bitterness knows
how. There does not seem to be very much
for the parties to fight about. The hostile
motion is apparently moved on general prin-
ciples. The Opposition declares that the
Government’s very modest Public Works pro-
posals might be and ought to be cut down,
and demands that the cutting down shall be
done, not by Parliament in the usual way, but
by a joint committee or combined secret
caucus of six, the abbreviated result to
be presented to the House for formal endorse-
ment. As the independent party of
Whitsitt says he intends to support the
Government, the no-confidence motion will
probably be negatived by a majority of one.
But as an election is now inevitable within a
few months, the necessity of mounting the
party stump and saying a few words through
Parliament to the electors is more pressing
than it was. Hence the outbreak of hostilities.
The Labor Government naturally wants to
get a new Electoral Bill up to the doorstep
of the Fee-Fo-Fum Chamber before Parlia-
ment expires next January ; also a Referen-
dum proposal, and a proposal to increase
death duties, and a Necessary Commodities
and Prices Control Bill. The time taken up in
nominally discussing the want of confidence
motion will, however, cut into the available
time so severely that there will be little left
over after the Estimates are bullocked
through. Clearly the Libs are out for ob-
struction. so the lot of the Labor crowd isn’t
happy. They may do something desperate in
their dire extremity, and if a dissolution
happens within a. few weeks and the general
elections are fixed for December, nobody, bar-
ring a few highly-unimaginative Libs, need
be astonished.
Tins is Tiie Bulletin’s special report of
Asquith’s speech; none others are genuine:
I am not going to defend myself, because I speak
as head of the Government. That’s the job to which,
in the days of peace, I was elected, and, personally,
I see no reason why I cannot conduct a war just as
beautifully as I conduct elections. Things are rot-
ten at present; but are we downhearted? (Cheers.)
All we have to do to win this war is to possess a
proper sense of perspective, a limitless stock of pati-
ence and an overflowing reservoir of courage. Organi-
sation or energy doesn’t matter. Just preserve your
perspective, be very, very patient, and very, very,
very brave, and everything will come out all right.
(Cheers.) In fact, everything is all right. It is
true that we haven’t three million men at the Flan-
ders front; but we have nearly one million. (Loud
cheers.) Then there are the contingents from the
Dominions. (Cheers.) The most remarkable fact
is that hitherto the loss of life in the whole of these
gigantic oversea operations is less than one-tenth of
one per cent. (Cheers.) That is, of course, referring
only to military loss on the seas. The loss on land
is somewhat larger, though there is no need for me
at this moment to enlarge on the sickness at the
Dardanelles. (Cheers.) Anyway, lam not going to
apologise for the Government, for I am the Govern-
ment. It is true it .was guilty of many shortcomings
and mistakes, but it means to muddle through in the
grand old Bulldog wa}'. (Loud cheers.) And it is
well to remember that there are always the Rus-
sians. (Cheers.) Also Mesopotamia. (Loud cheers.)
It is well to recall what a blessed word is Mesopo-
tamia. We have also nearly got to Bagdad. (Cheers.)
Bagdad—not Aehi Baba. Lord Fisher didn’t like
the naval attack upon the Dardanelles; but then
Lord Fisher wasn't the Cabinet, and everybody
knows that the Cabinet is the finest possible instru-
ment for winning the war. Even the War Council
approved of it, and, also the Grand Duke Nicholas.
(Cheers.) But Kitchener hadn't any troops to spare,
so I decided to make the attempt without them.
(Cheers.) I made a mistake —(Cheers) —but I admit
it. (Cheers.) I fully admit it. (Renewed cheers.)
No one was more responsible than I. (Tremendous
cheers.) I also admit that when we did send the
troops, I was keenly disappointed because they were
sent too late. (Cheers.) But the nation must not
forget the magnificent bravery of the Australians,
(Cheers.) And if the Allies are too late to save
Servia, it must be remembered that up,to the last
moment our diplomacy believed in Greece. (Cheers.)
Why ? Our diplomacy was wrong. I admit it was
wrong. (Cheers.) Servia, or what is left of Servia,
may be assured that her independence, or what is
left of it, is regarded by us as one of the essential
objects of the Alliance. (Cheers.) The financial
position is, of course, bad. But Germany’s is worse.
(Cheers.) Voluntary recruiting is haphazard and
capricious and unjust. But compulsion would for-
feit the maintenance of national unity. (Cheers.)
So would defeat, but I am not going to enlarge on
that subject. (Cheers.) There ought to be a War
Cabinet, but so far I haven’t appointed one. (Cheers:)
And, personally, I ain’t going to resign. (Cheers.)

If it weren’t so disastrous to the State it
would be amusing to wateli the efforts
of The Age to scrape the Peacock
Ministry off the rock. The combina-
tion boasts a following of less than one-
third of the House; but the other two-
thirds will not coalesce to heave it out. Of
■course no real work is clone or can be done.
There is urgent need of a Greater Melbourne
Bill, an effective Public Health Act, and
other measures that the public has long been
looking for —and will continue to look for
until it has sense enough to drop the Party
system stupidity, and insist on Elective
Ministries, with the Initiative and Referen-
dum. While the Age earnestly calls on Pea-
cock to turn it up it offers nothing in his
place. Thb Tory corner is unthinkable; the
Labor Opposition is anathema ; so the only
choice is among Peacock’s private followers
—a matter of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Meanwhile the illogical journal meSiodically
opposes every movement to transfer to the
National Parliament any of the powers now
unused or neglected by the petty State
legislatures.
According to new Prime Minister Hughes,
the proper attitude of Australians in connec-
tion with the war is to “mind their own
business”—to train and equip men for ser-
vice, and not discuss or criticise the conduct
of the campaign. What fine, crusted old
Toryism!
God bless the Squire and his relations,
And keep us in our proper stations.
The war is a matter of transcendent im-
portance to Australia, and for the nation to
carry on such a struggle with its head in a
bucket is equivalent to the surrender of its
self-governing rights. So far as this paper
is aware, no Parliament in the world ever
submitted to a war being waged by the
country it represented without wanting to
know something about the disturbance. In
France, in England, in Russia, even in Ger-
many, the war is almost the sole subject of
Parliamentary discussion. And the proposi-
tion that Australia’s place in the Empire is
that of a mere sleeping partner—an inferior
person who must be told nothing and keep
his mouth shut —is one to which the utmost
disrespect is due.

“Rag” : The paymaster’s window at Victoria
Barracks, Sydney, presents a woeful spec-
tacle these times. Any day there is a crowd
of maimed Gallipoli warriors, ranking from
bugle-boy to major, jostling for the money
we owe them. When a man battles his way
to the window, lie delivers his book, and is
informed that he is in credit (say) £5O. He
asks for it, and is informed that “the most
we can do for. you is (say) £5. Come again
on. Monday, and we may be able to let you
have a few more.” “But, damn it, man, I’ve
my wife and children stopping with me at
tlie hotel, and I owe this much already.”
“Can’t be helped,” grunts the clerk, and that
settles it. One officer, after waiting with
others for three hours, was given a cheque
on the Commonwealth Bank, but upon pre-
senting it he was informed that it was; only
negotiable through an account. Not know-
ing anyone handy who ran an account be
had to wait until next day to have it
“opened” by the pay-clerk at the- Barracks.
Upon presenting it at the bank a second
time he was told that it was not in order
owing to whoever made it out having for-
gotten to endorse it with the rubber stamp
of the pay office. I met him as he was re-
turning to try his luck for the third time.
It was all right, but he swore that he’d pre-
fer to charge an enemy’s machine-gun across
open country than contend here for his
arrears of pay. Every returned soldier I’ve
questioned says likewise.
“Real Australian” : Japan stirred up a
remarkable agitation in China when she
forced upon her an ultimatum. A “National
Salvation Fund Movement” was started to
raise £5,000,000 to arm the Republic,
establish arsenals and develop home
industries. The fund is open to Chinese
only, and beggars, coolies, schoolboys
and merchants are subscribing. A national
boycott against Japanese goods in China
was started at the same time. The
Pekin (Chinese) Chamber of Commerce
sent out a stirring anneal, headed
“Never Forget the Nation’s Disgrace!” In
Hankow and Hangchow 200 Japanese shops
were closed, and in the latter city was
formed “The United Association for Advis-
ing the Nation to Use - Native Goods.” It
is really a very serious position for Japan.
The leading men of the movement assert
there' are 200,000,000 males in China, and
they have asked the Government to raise
an army of 10,000,000, of whom one million
shall always be on active service. Should
this new spirit of solidarity amongst the
Chinese gather force and spread, Japan has
a contract ahead of her. What a fine
national .Spirit is revealed in the titles of
these sodalities —“The National Salvation
Fund,” “The Society to Propagate the Use
of National G00,.5” and “The Society for
the Protection of Native Trade.” The
associations are opening “Show-houses for
Native Goods” everywhere. Meanwhile the
people themselves are demanding heavier
taxes and Government iteform so as to nre-
pare properly for national defence. The
President has created a Board of Censors
whose job,, it is to criticise all governmental
action and suggest administrative and
economic improvements. That’s a charming
idea; and when, the Board has finished it
ought to be picnicked down to Australia to
tell the Governments. Jliat—buLmwins-money
to waste is not the way to build a strong,
self-reliant nation.

News from the part of the world ou which
Australian eyes are fixed is still so meagre
and so unreliable that discussion about the
struggle, except in its very broadest
aspects, has become a more or less pathetic
sort of joke. What our army is doing;
what it is going to do; what steps are being
taken to provide it with winter clothing and
shelter; where it is going to winter; what
has been done to grapple with the heart-
breaking ravages of sickness among the
men ; whether it is going to be reinforced —
on these matters not one authoritative word
has been spoken. They are points about
which the Australian people should have
information. To withhold it is a scandal too
gross for defence. In every other country
engaged in the war the people are at least
told something about the welfare of their
troops. Australians are told nothing. Their
Minister for Defence Is a mere clerk. All
this is horribly unfair to the men who are
fighting and to the families they have left
behind them. It blindfolds the nation and,
worst of all, acts as a powerful influence
against recruiting. The gag that a por-
tentous silence was necessary in Australia,
in order to keep the enemy ignorant,
long ago lost whatever litttle force it may
have had. It is not the enemy in Germany
who is being kept in the dark now. It is
the patriot in the next street —the patriot
who would turn on the administrators if he
was permitted to know of administra-
tive misdeeds. So scandals are hushed
up on the hypocritical preteilce that Pots-
dam must not learn of our weaknesses.
Meanwhile the position in the Balkans is
changing rapidly. German and Bulgarian
armies seem to have junctioned, the Ser-
vians are being steadily forced backwards,
and railway 1 communication between Con-
stantinople and Austria appears to be some-
where close at hand —-that is, unless the
Allied troops landed at Salonica and now
in touch with the Bulgar ran get astride of
that, line of communication. Apparently a
considerable force is being thrown ashore,
and as there are rumors of a Russian army
hovering ominously in the North, and as
Kitchener is going out to somewhere near
the. Front thereabouts, and as an Anglo-
Indian army is on the skyline near Bagdad,
the Hun and his friends in the baggy pants
are. going to have a hard row to hoe. But
it is a vague tangled-up yarn that comes
along from day to day, the only certain
things being that the Servians are going
astern and that the Greek is sitting down
and being a friend to everybody while he
waits to see who carries the punch. All
things considered, the most amazing feature
of a wildly complicated business has been
the success of the crude bluff put up by the
Greek. But to get very much further with-
out stubbing his toe he will need the luck of
a Chinaman.
■*- — ■
This is the way of the Defence Depart-
ment, which says that munitions are the
most important thing of all. As long ago
as. last June certain patriotic citizens of
Williamstown (Vic.) formed'a co. for the
purpose of manufacturing machine guns, and
endeavored to obtain drawings and plans or
the loan of a gun to enable them to get busy.
First they were told it would take six
months to turn out a gun (they didn’t ex-
pect it to be done in a week) ; then it was
said it would take two years (the war pro-
mises to last quite that long) ; then they
were told there were neither guns nor plans
available, and they are no further ahead
than they were When they started. We
could not make shell-cases, it was said!
They are being made. We could not build
complete aeroplanes. They have been built.
And the North Melbourne firm that built
the . engine for the first flier declared its
willingness to build machine guns, yet so
far it has got no orders, while the Williams-
town company is blocked at every turn.
Will Minister Pearce cease expatiating on
the feats of his department and explain just
why Australia isn’t supplying its troops
with machine guns on the same scale as the
Huns are supplying the Turks?

“Clubman” on the Ford car controversy:
lie Ford, the motor-car manufacturer, and his
antagonism to the recent British war loan. The
“trade” story (B. 4/11/T5) endeavors to cloud the
fact that profits on Ford cars sold here go to Ford,
who is described as a “peace crank.” Apparently
his idea of peace is a peace to our disadvantage, if
hampering the British war loan is considered by him'
a step in the direction of bringing peace nearer.
The patriotism of firms and their employees who
happen to handle his cars under the British flag in
no way excuses his attitude, for they are but the
channel through which the money flows from us to
him ; neither does it condone the fact that he used
his money or threatened to use it to hinder the
British war loan. The “trade” story is that Aus-
tralia gets only Canadian cars. Well, who owns
the Canadian works? Or, rather, who. is the largest
owner of those works? If Ford is, then the
profits on the output go chiefly to a man who
“would tie a tincan to this joint Anglo-French Com-
mission, and chase it back to Europe.”

The 2nd Engineer’s report on a musical
steam trial: —
I wasn’t offered a programme when I arrived at
Verbrugghen’s concert in the Sydney Town Hall
last Saturday. But I didn’t worry about that. I
have enjoyed many a thunderstorm without a pro-
gramme, and I don’t suppose printed slips will be
passed around at the Last .Judgment. It sounded as if
the Judgment had come, when, right at the. end, the
brass division stood up in their high seats to get an
uninterrupted view of the conductor’s beat and
blew like three typhoons. The big, bell-mouthed
brute that looks like a fire-engine in convulsions
puffed deep elephant-grunts into the boiling pool of
violins below, and the enraged trombone stretched
and contracted its double neck and snorted madly
on the brink like the last of the dragons, while the
bass viol hippopotami plunged and grunted in the pool
where the trombone wanted to swim. Away up in the
opposite corner, right behind , the great kettledrums
and the side drums and the bass drum, a fierce,
elderly gentleman with spectacles and a short beard
swung a long, two-handed flail at the father of all
bass drums, while the nearest of the 3000 listeners
shrank back in their seats and tried to look unem-
barrassed as the flashing stick fanned their noses. It
was a truly noble row, in which even the smallest
and meekest contrivance had a part. And, by way
of contrast, there were times when the forest of
violin bows were still and the man behind the
kettledrum took a short holiday like the gentle-
men who buzzed through the wooden waterspouts
and boomed down the brass bath-lieaters, while a
bald-headed, retiring instrumentalist whose head just
showed above the rows in front tootled a gentle
little back-parlor ditty on something like an office-
ruler. One of the honorary hissers you can always
find at these shows had a seat behind me in the
gallery. He made death-adder sounds all the after-
noon at the people round about him, and thoroughly
enjoyed himself. If he had been near enough to the
balustrade 1 would have pushed him over. In the
awful silence just before one item some unlucky
brute dropped his boxer hat on the floor ; it sounded
like a bomb. I would like a heavy penalty imposed
on the woman who goes to crowded afternoon shows
“THE WAY BACKS” AT SYDNEY

MR. WAYBACK (William Stewart), after
dinner at the Emu Coffee Palace: “Say,

drenched with cheap scent and then looks about at
her neighbors as if she found them insufferable.
And, if I’m not wandering from the subject, I may
say Verbrugghen is a great musician; he has the
proper dusty appearance of genius, and when
Beethoven gets him excited his mop of hair turns
into writhing rattlesnakes.

“The Man Who Stayed at Home” was
awarded another week at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, by a grateful management. But he
catches his last spy in Sydney on Friday
evening. “Kick-in’' makes a start at this
theatre on Saturday with a new glossary of
U.S. slang. After one brief week it changes
over to the Criterion, and makes room for
“Paul Jones,” with Florence Young in the
lead.

To-night will be the last occasion at Syd-
ney Criterion when “A Pair of Sixes” will
win at poker. Next week the theatre will
be closed.
The Waybaeks, who have come down to
Sydney, will leave the Palace homestead to-
morrow evening and continue the harvesting
at the Royal. Dad reckons about two weeks
will see them through with the job there.

It is rumored that gentle Aggie has been
deported from the Little Theatre in Sydney,
where Howard Vernon and Vinia de Lioitte
still refuse to admit they are downhearted,
and affirm that reinforcements have been
engaged to take the place of the strenuous
amateur with whom the show opened.
But the reports from headquarters do
not make it clear whether when gentle
Aggie left she took the “bird” home
with her. Upon that the length of the
campaign under General “X” at the Little
Theatre will depend.
AT SYDNEY
TIVOLI.
Walter James, "King of the Laugh Trust,”
and Hazel Moran, from the Wild-vaudeville
West.
The open-air scheme of entertainment is
spreading in Sydney. Premier Holman
announces his intention to take a pitch in
Macquarie-street and compete for business
with the Violet Dandies, showing in the
Garden Theatre, Bayswater-road. The main
difference between the shows will be that
to Branseombe’s you take your best
girl; to Holman’s it will be better to take
your best corkscrew.
** * *
Walter James (who arrives roaring from
the U.S.) is one of the week-end novelties at
Sydney Tivoli, and Hazel Moran is the
other. Hazel is a stage cowlady who skips
lightly and draws beautiful falling curves
and circles in the air with a slim, snaky
rope. Violiniste Mary Law is now fiddling
away her last ‘nights, and cooniste Coy de
Trickey is still giving the audience the tip
that her complexion isn’t really smudgy by
leaving one white arm unpainted and letting
down her great golden mane.- Jim Harkins’s
boyish confidences, the Staffords’ merry out-
door turn, juggler Nolan’s fooling, and
Morris Golden’s fiddling are other bright
features of the show.
** * *
Sydney screenings for this week:—
Crystal Palace: “John Glade’s Honor,” in which
the old trio—the back-at-the-office husband, the neg-
lected wife, and the Other Man —occupy five acts in
telling the old story in a new way.
Lyric : “No Greater Love” —Le Queux’s popular
novel photo-played, with Regina Badet, of “Vendetta”
fame, as the mother who goes to awful lengths,
widths and depths to save her chee-ild.
Empress: “Child of the North” —a frozen drama
tempered by love and eventually thawed by a red-
hot murder.
* * * *
“The Old Guard” surrenders on Friday at
Melbourne Majesty’s, but it doesn’t die.
Some day it will go into fiction again, and
then perhaps the inane fooling which has
ever been incidental to Murielle’s song will
be eliminated by order of the Censor. Poor
Murielle, who is Gladys Moncrieff in this
revival, is required to stand stock still and
look foolish whilst the Mayor and the Mar-
quis pretend to play cricket and football with
her top-note. This causes the groundlings
to titter and the more judicious to feel sick.
Nothing sillier was ever perpetrated by two
comedians acting in collusion. The spec-
tacle of those laborious entertainers feign-
ing to bowl, bat," batch or kick an invisible
ball, which is vaguely understood to be a
musical .sound—the spectacle of a pair of
often-amusing male mummers outcircusing
the wickedest antics of circus clowning,
whilst a sweet soprano voice waits mutely
for the supposititious ball to be thrown back
into her mouth that she may finish her song
—it is enough to make angels weep and The
Bulletin representative tear his burnished
scalp. Then he remembers that the wretched
fooling was born with the first production
of “The Old Guard,” and has been growing
ever since. The comedians are merely fol-
lowing precedent and trying to go one better.
It isn’t their fault; and sudden death would
be more than they deserve. But they ought to
be sharply spoken to. For next Saturday and
two following nights “Our Miss Gibbs”
will be revived, and on Wednesday matinde
and night “Ma Mie Rosettte” will conclude
the Royal Comics’ season.
* * * *
At Melbourne Royal four pieces of the
melodramatic season will be warmed up to-
night (Thursday) as a parting feast for the
gods. Muriel Starr and Millward are leav-
ing Melbourne to return no more, so, by way
of giving everybody one last chance to see
those performers in four different versions
of themselves, the management will present
them in one act of each of four plays—the act
of “Madame X” being No. 1, in which Muriel
Starr is just Muriel, and not the bedrugged
Madame of some years later. On Saturday
the newly-constructed J.C.W. Comedy Co.
comes to the Royal to ' play “A Pair of
Sixes.”
* H: * *
“A Scrape o’ the Pen” is nae drawin’ a’
the toon to the Princess’s, but it should
attract more people than are prepared to
love it for its ain Scawtch sake. Graham
Moffat’s play has at least an air of realism
in its homeliness and many touches of humor
in the dialogue. The thread of interest is
slender*, but it never breaks, and when at
last it has all been reeled off the audience
sits staring at the curtain until the little
orchestra plays the Anthem which spells
“Go!” The audience mostly seems sur-
prised to hear the band’s announcement.
Even the sudden arrival of the undertaker’s
man had not persuaded the crowd that the
play had breathed its last.
* * * *
The hero’s willingness to degrade himself
on a small point of honor remains the out-
standing feature of “O’Leary, V.C.,” at Mel-
bourne King’s. Warrior Allen Doom*
cheerfully throws up his commission merely
on the assumption that his sister’s supposed
“shame” is a smudge on his own military
record calling for his removal from the
company of brave men. The fact that his
sister is lawfully wedded makes Doone’s self-
sacrifice superfluous, but the lady' is not
allowed to mention the matter in his hearing
for fear of spoiling his great pose as a fal-
tered martyr bravely enduring the false
accusation of “Cow-ard!” while ruefully
gnawing crusts in a Parisian garret. Many
times her brother’s awful sufferings must
have tempted Eily Dale to open her mouth
and explain her position, but for the sake
of his limelight she maintains a silence that
is nothing less than an insult to the reputa-
tion of her sex.
# * * *
New arrivals at the Tivoli in Melbourne
are Private Pearce from Gallipoli, who
sings songs of warlike sentiment in a good
baritone voice, and Betty Don. a lyric
soprano of the sweet and light class. Also
the agile dancing Tyrells are hack for ;i
time, and the Warwick Burlesquers and the
Belgian concertists are preceding the Follies
as before. There is heaps of stuff in the
Tivoli bill at present, and some of it is good
quality. By the way, the. Tivoli matinees
are now restricted to Wednesday and Satur-
day.

Amy Castles, soon leaving these shores
for America, will give some Saturday Pop
Concerts before she goes. This Saturday
(13th) the concert will be at the Audito-

costume comedy people, are to start at the
Audi.

The Wirth Family, and the Seals, and all
the other features of the Greatest Show on
Earth, are still at the Circus building in
Melbourne. Thus far the last nights of the
Circus are not announced, but the caged
menagerie glances furtively around as
though always expecting to be moved on.
* * * *
The Bulletin is pleased. £o bestow, a
bouquet on Alice Pierce, an imitator of ex-
ceptional ability who anpeared for the first
time at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday. Alice
gives striking replicas of English artists like
Ada Reeve, Ethel Levey and Mrs. Pat
Campbell, particularly obliging with a copy
of the last-named as Eliza Doolittle in Barney
Shaw’s “Pygmalion.” Also the young lady
renders Muriel Starr’s speech to fluff-
merchant Gilder in Act 1 of “Within the
Law,” and makes it a convincing mixture
of outraged innocence and honest tears. Yet
ar the Saturday matinee the mob that had
never heard of Shaw, Mrs. Campbell or
“Pygmalion” cave the damsel the “bird” in
a most unpleasant fashion. Other fresh
artists on the present programme are the
Mullaney Twins, songsters and dancers;
Manuel de Fra, a clever, equilibrist; and
Slavin and Thompson, a middling patter
duo.

Adelaide evenings continue wintry ; but this
does not keep people away from the open-
air entertainers on opposite sides of North
Terrace. They have a certain family resem-
blance, but at the Exhibition they call them-
selves Pink Dandies, and at Austral Gardens
they are Ideals. There is some good “enter-
taining” at the King’s, too, by May Erne,
Armitage and Hine, and the Newmans; but
these are only items in a long -variety bill.
The Tivoli is doing really fine business with
“The Silver King,” which is old enough to
be new to a lot of people. Julius Knight

“Nibbidard”: Henrietta Amelia Cochrane
is a young person of resource. With her
husband, John Andrew, she came before
Melbourne General Sessions last week on a
charge of forging a marriage certificate. The
Crown story was that Henrietta Amelia’s
father had refused to consent to her mar-
riage because she was not 18 years of age.
In those days she was Miss Kuelin. A
Collingwood parson, asked to provide the
connubial incantations, gave her a docu-
ment and told her that her father must sign
it. Two days later the couple were wed,
the signature being apparently in good
order and condition. Then the girl’s father
asked questions, and was told by the bride-
groom that “a man in the street” had signed
the paper. “I bound up my husband’s arms
so that he was unabje to write,” volunteered
the girl, “and the man in the street signed
the name given to iiim.” The jury smiled:
the Crown reduced the charge to one of
uttering; the pair, pleading guilty, were lec-
I.tired by ’s Onah, and then were released on
undertaking not to get married that way
any more.

year on Guy Fawkes Day. He appeared at
Astle.v’s, London, at six years of age; his
mother and grandmother were both connected
with that theatre. Ford came to Sydney in
1847, and built the first theatre in what is
now Queensland. Later, in Sydney, he
was the first manager of the old Scandi-
navian Music Hall, opened about 1870, on
the site of the Tivoli. Had “Old Ford”
stuck to sheep, gnd put the same work into
jumbucks that he did into variety shows, he
might have made a fortune. As it is
“E.N.M.”; Since “ILF.” —who is evi-
dently not a Turk, although he uses (B.
28/10/T5) the word “bosh” in the best
Stamboul manner—puts me iff the position
ot defender of the' “Philharmonic” pitch, as
against the “Continental” wicket or links, I
wish to point out that, despite “R.F.’s”
frantic denial, the Continental pitch is a
pretty deadly thing to all (which means all
in Australia) who have been used to the
Philharmonic. “R.F.” emphasises my point
as to its unsuitability for bands by remark-
coolly that the P.P. “is retained only by
military bands !” Also “by some firms of
pianoforte makers.” Yes —British, not Ger-
man ! And Australian, not Hungarian! As
for the voice, “R.F.’s” statement about Patti
and Sims Reeves is ridiculous and beside
the question. It all depended upon what
instrument maker those great artists were
singing for. If, say, for Broadwood, they
sang to Broadwood’s pitch (which isn’t
Continental) ; if for Bechstein ( Gott
strafe Bechstein!) —why, then, they sang for
Bechstein at Bechstein’s beastly old Con-
tinental pil^h.
“W.J.S.”: “R.F.’s” contention (B.
28/10/T5) that “English” pitch changes an
E flat symphony “virtually” into E natural
is untrue. Each key, G major, E flat major,
etc., has a certain definite mental effect. The
whole character . of, say, a hymn-tune is
changed by transposing to another key; and
competent organists frequently avail them-
selves of this knowledge when a hymn, set
to one tune, is sung to another. It is for
this reason that songs written for a soprano
are a failure when transposed for a mezzo-
soprano or for alto voice. This knowledge
wisely used is no small factor in deciding
whether Smith, Pulwiski or Tremolomolo is
the soundest musician. No change of pitch
alters the microscopic intervals of a key.
“J.F.H.”: London Incorporated Society
of Authors, Composers and Playwrights
issues a public warning against a very com-
mon and widely-prevalent form of robbery.
Church choirs and musical societies are in
the habit of buying one or two copies of a
work, and then with their pens multiplying
it for use and distribution amongst their
members, “in order to save the cost of pur-
chasing an adequate supply.” This sort of
thing is a breach of the Copyright Act,
which “entails serious loss to composers,”
and; the Society intends to use its sharpest
axe on offenders. All over the world many
good ladies have indulged in this music-
copying business, not realising that the pro-
perty created by a man’s brains is just as
much his own as the property created by
his hands, and equally entitled to protection.
“Busk” takes a few jerks backwards: —
Died in America a few weeks ago, Eleanor Carey,
known in Australia as Lena Carey. She first emerged
in Sydney from the ballet. Montgomery was fasci-
nated, and her friends wanted her to marry him,
but she said, “I won’t be sold to Montgomery.”
Anyhow, this was published in the newspapers. Lena
came to Melbourne, engaged by Coppin as leading
lady. Hattie Shepparde was in the company. Dr.
Neild, critic of the Australasian, championed
Hattie’s claim to be in the lead, but Coppin knew
better. Neild even changed his signature of “Jaques”
to “Tahite,” an anagram of Hattie. Great was his
platonic infatuation; he had 14 children, too. After
the Royal was burnt Coppin produced Robertson’s
“School,” and other plays, in St. George’s Hall, with
Carey and Shepparde, supported by Ireland and
Appleton. Miss Carey was admirable as the original
Galatea in Australia, and' made a hit as Mercy
Merrick, in “The New Magdalen,” supported by Dam-
piei as Julian Gray. She must have almost reached
the age of Ellen Terry.
“Jaques” : If real thrill is the thing at the
picture-show there is one theatre in Sydney
.that has quite satisfied me on two occa-
sions. Over 2000 people were startled the
other night when a boy squealed excitedly,
“Look at the rat! Look at the rat!” and
pointed roofwards. There, sure enough, was
a big rodent doing Blondin on a girder. The
screams of the women and girls combined
with the exclamations of the kids must have
scared the animal, as it missed its footing
and seemed to hang on with one hand. How-
ever, it clawed back and performed the
journey from one end of the theatre to the
other and disappeared. On two occasions
that has happened in the same theatre and
next time I’m betting the rat falls. Then
there will be a circus.
London theatres are almost entirely given
over to revues, frivolities and musical
comedies. Hardly a - single high-class,
“elevating,” superior play is on anywhere.
A Berlin paper prints in parallel columns
the programmes of the principal shows in
the two capitals. A striking contrast be-
yond a doubt. The Berlin theatres are
nearly all staging Shakspeare, Schiller,
■ Hauptmann and other heavy-weight drama-
tists. The German argument seems to be
that people like the Londoners who run
their theatres this way in war-time ought
to be annihilated by Ku.ltur.
“B. J.”: The other day a husband who
had long been a-missing was hauled before
a Melbourne suburban court and ordered to
pay 10 shillings a week towards the support
of his wife. The lady had despaired of find-
ing him until one day a friend rushed in
with the glad news that She had visited a
picture show where a military funeral was
being screened, and in the driver of one of
the mourning coaches had recognised the
missing matrimonial link.
“J.F.H.”: Passed out, London’s veteran
low comedian Arthur Williams, who strongly
reminded old Australians of George Coppin,
whom he strikingly resembled in face and
broad humor. His greatest success was
Lurcher in “Dorothy.” When the part was
first handed to him it contained only 30
lines, but he expanded it night by night
until it gradually became the outstanding
character of the piece. Fred Robson, the
reigning low comedian of 60 years ago, whose
style and mannerisms were closely copied by
George Coppin, first gave Williams a helping
hand and started him on a successful career
in the same line.
Londoip Shaftesbury was to have been
opened a month ago by Beecham for a
season of opera, Mozart’s seldom-heard
“Magic Flute” being included. The caste
inclu-.es several names known in Australia
—Rosina Buckman ; Blarney, the stout , tenor
with the tired voice who supported Bel Sorel
five years ago; Jeanne Brola, Edith Clegg,
D’Oisley and W. J. Samuel.
“Jwosp”: “Harrison 0'.,” the smiter of
American playwrights, should rejoice to
hear of the death of Paul Armstrong, the
part-author of “Via Wireless” and the
adapter of “Alias Jimmy Valentine,” which
Williamson Ltd. produced in Australia.
Armstrong was really a brilliant collabo-
rator rather than a dramatist. Heart disease
took him off: the stage after his main works
had been beating for 46 years. “Jimmy
Valentine” was his biggest success, and O.
Henry supplied the best part of it.
Frank Nankivell, the Australian artist
who has been a New Yorker for many years,
has made good in a new way by drawing-
reels for the ;These are not draw-
ings on the screen where the hand is shown,
but a complete story in drawings.' His two
latest are a humorous adaptation from iEsop
and a modernised version of Mother Goose.
Both are likely to be seen in Australia soon.
“B.B.” : “Jimmie Pannikin” is in similar
trouble to Randolph Bedford —-his good
name has been taken away. Victpr Prince
in his “revusical” comedy, “Full Steam
Ahead,” at Adelaide, has stolen the anti-
child-slavery battler’s pen-name to tack on
to one of the low-comedy characters. Origi-
nality has its limits, of course; but this
seems a bit over the fehce.
“Stargazer”: The reappearance of “Paul
Jones” recalls Fanny Lyddiard, Snazelle,
Leach and Johnnie Gourlay to ageing play-
goers. The most spirited performance, to
my thinking, was that of Gourlay, a sprightly
little American and a remarkable'dancer.
Leslie Holland is credited with being a light
and nimble Trocadero; but compared with
Gourlay he is as a traction-engine to a
feather in the wind. My recollection is of
an Opera House (Melb.) season which must
have been super-excellent, since so many of
the figures still hold out vividly in the public
mind. Gourlay survives in America, but
the other stars have ceased to twinkle.
“Row M.”: Maud Fane, the bright sing-
ing girl of Warwick’s Burlesquers, now
doing the Tivoli circuit, steps from polite
vaudeville into a principal part in the
J.C.W. panto., and thereby blazes a new
professional cross-trail—Or I think so. Maud
has an unusually powerful voice of good
quality, good looks, and —best of all—a sense
of humor. She suffers from musical-comedy
ambitions, and, now that she is with the
Firm, will probably get a chance to indulge
them. I rate her with the three most natural
comediennes I remember of recent years—
May Beatty (Stevenson’s Opera Co.), the
leader of the Sprightly Sisters (at Sydney
Tivoli about four years ago), and Grace
Ellsworth (of the unlucky “Mayor of
Tokio” co.). Miss Fane is the fourth in
about 15 years, which shows they don’t
come by every boat.
James T. Tanner, the well-known libret-
tist, died recently in England. Among other
things he perpetrated the book of “Our Miss
Gibbs,” which ran for 83 weeks in Sydney
during 1911, and the “Dancing Mistress,”
just staged for a couple of weeks at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.). Grinding out this sort
of stuff seems to be a paying job. Anyhow.
Tanner washed up for close on £12,000.
Major-General Godley backs Australia’s
war correspondent Bean, who has con-
sistently urged relatives and friends not to
believe' the stories of alleged atrocities
practised on soldiers at Gallipoli by the
Turks. Writing to Col. Chaffey, in Maori-
land, the General says:—
It is quite true that the Turk is a clean tighter,
and compares very favorably in this respect with
the German. I also have no hesitation in saying
that at this moment I believe he is a better and
braver tighter than the German. Anything mon
valiant than the way he has fought us lately it
would be impossible to conceive, and he is a really
formidable enemy. He has treated our wounded
and prisoners extremely well.
In the night of trouble that’s one comforting
item, anyhow.
There is evidently something stirring
down South, for the “Southern Lights”
were visible in Tasmania on Novem-
ber 2 for the second time this year. Their
former appearance—on June 17—-was much
more brilliant, but it is something of a record
for them to show up at all so late in the
season.
It is a beastly reflection on somebody or
something that with six Labor Governments
in power in Australia, there are more serious
strikes in progress at this moment than there
have been since the early ’nineties. And it
is a worse reflection still on somebody or
something that the strikes are the most
serious and the most numerous in the Ma
State, where the Government has been in
office longest and has the easiest working
majority. Either these Governments have
failed to supply labor with means to settle
industrial disputes by reason, or labor doesn’t
want reason to settle its disputes. Either
way you look at it things are pretty rotten
from the Labor standpoint.
POOR OLD ACTOR:
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O Gouty Lover, hobbling through your part,
For what lost "armchairs do you sigh in vain!
Upon the grave’s brink you must ply your art,
And sigh like air-brakes for a little gain.
Upon your shaveq cheeks should wave the beard
That masks Old Age and hides Time’s cruel scars;
Instead, your hairless chops are thickly smeared
With the queer colors'that are found on “stars."
Pity the old mime with the shining pate!
In foolish rags towards his poor grave he reels;
Wearied to death, he still must simulate
The youthful raptures he no longer feels;
With toothless gums he yammers of his love;
The limelight pours; the high gods shift their
feet;
And falling, falling from the gloom above
Drift the poor husks of that strange food they eat.
O Gouty Lover, while the peanuts rain,
For what lost armchairs do you sigh in vain!

“Warrumbucca”: From their tactics, it
seemed fairly certain that the Turks
were not launching any attack that
night, so most of our men slept the
heavy sleep of the trenches. Sentries

salary."
"Of course not. But what a splendid excuse
it would he to ask the old pot for a
rise."
at various intervals peered through the
narrow, sand-bagged loopholes, ready to pick
off prowling snipers or give the alarm in
case of attack. From one of these sentry
posts came a sharp cry, followed hy the
thud of a falling body. Evidently a rifle
bullet had got a man through a loophole.
My sergeant gave the grim, familiar call in
a low tone: “Stretcher bearers!” The call
was picked up and passed along down the
communication trench like a low echo—-
“Stretcher hearers!” “Stretcher hearers!”
until it died away in the distance. With
the sergeant I walked along the fire trench
to see about having the casualty carried to
the communication trench where the hearers
would take him over. But the “casualty”
was sitting up now, painfully wiping sand
from his eye, A bullet had ripped the
sand-bagged end of the loophole, spirting
grit into the sentry’s eye and dazing him for
the moment. However, he pulled himself
together, assured me that he was all right,
and hopped hack to his post. Having in-
spected my section and returned to the
junction of the fire and communication
trenches, I waited there on hearing the
steady plod of two men up the long, steep,
tortuous communication trench. The new
arrivals were Joe, Bill and a stretcher. Joe
was leader and spokesman, and putting
down the stretcher demanded, in a sharp,
business-like voice, “Where’s the bloke V”
Other things had happened, and I momen-
tarily forgot the incident, so absently
queried, “What bloke?” That exploded Joe.
“Some rotten swine” had called for stretcher
bearers, “and me and Bill' shoved off.” I
should have reproved Joe for his language
(there was a lot more) but —well, we don’t
stand very much on ceremony here, anyhow.
Besides, I knew I was expected to share in
the just indignation of Joe and Bill that no
“bloke” had been and got hisself hurt, and
thus given Joe and Bill a good chance to
get sniped, too, as they took their case to
the dressing station.

November 1 was the 91st anniversary of
the first trial by civil jury in Australasia.
It was a court of quarter sessions held in
Sydney. The first nisi prius case before an
Australian civil jury of 12 was heard on
February 12, 1825—the King v. Robert
Cooper, of the Brisbane distillery. Inci-
dentally, the defendant won.
“Jonz” : The Maori wowser is nursing his

He announces that be is going to run on be-

be pictures, some of them gifts, but most of
them purchased from local artists. When he
has them gathered together they are to be
sent through the country along with the
Government Collection and the valuable
Chevalier Collection in Auckland. The
whole proceeds go to the fund for Convales-
cent Camps for Soldiers which the National
Government is going to try to build and run
on subscribed money ; and if the frolic turns
out trumps, Russell may ask the State to go
in for it annually.
“11. C.” : There was some excitement near
Ivanhoe (N.S.W.) the
other day when the
Education Depart-
ment’s travelling hos-
pital met the local
school. The young-
sters were examined
and several of them
repaired. Two, a hoy
and girl, were told off
for a trifling opera-
tion. The girl was
treated first while
Bill awaited his turn
on the outskirts of
the little crowd of
children and their
parents. Presently
there was a yell and
cries of “I don’t want
that!” That, was
Bill’s cue. In 2§ sec-
onds there was only
a small dust-cloud
where : he- had disap-
peared in the scrub.
A pursuing party
that included men,
women, children and
dogs failed to locate
him, and at sundown
the search was aban-
doned. That night,
when the moon was
high and the travel-
ling hospital gone be-
yond recall, a small,
tousled boy emerged
from the shadow of the scrub and upended
himself through the back window of home.

enemy’s supplies an’ make things inconvenient.
Consequently, they blaze away at his line of com-
munication. Along these routes day an’ night is a
continual traffic of mule teams with water and
tucker, unarmed blokes with ammunition or even

over th’ place. I’ve seen drivers, mules an’ wounded
men sent straight to ’ell by one shot. Even the
ambulance blokes work in singlets, or stripped t’

uniform here; which is mostly nothink in summer.
An’, any’ow, th’ enemy don’t know most er th’

“Mulga Scrub” from the war zone: — t
The Australians have a grouch against the.eternal
saluting of officers. As you might expect, those who
look for it most deserve it least, and some of the
Cold Country officahs squeal terribly if their petty
dignity is ’ bumped by non-recognition of stars or
crown. To a. decent-minded fellow this continuous
semaphoring is just plain rot. On the other hand,
the old gibe that the Australian resents discipline
has been sent kite-high by recent happenings. At
Lonesome Pine, for instance, the order was given
that the attack was to be carried out with bayc-et
only. “Don't shoot,” the order went, “if you can
possibly avoid it.’’ And see how the Australian
interpreted that. For him it simply meant that he
must not shoot at all—must die, rather. For days
afterwards our dead were found with the business end
of their bayonets showing signs of usage, but in every
case the 150 rounds of ammunition were intact.
There was no grouch about doing that. But for
the merely ceremonial things our fellows haven’t
either time or patience.
A poor but dishonest young man had a
lamentable piece of bad luck in St. Kilda
(Vic.) the other night, lie had entered a
washhouse on the nod and was endeavoring
to remove a lawn-mower with as little noise
as might be, when suddenly he found him-
self involved in an intricate kind of thief-
talcer. The contrivance simply jumped at
him out of the dark and wound itself all
about him. The more he struggled the more
hopelessly he was involved in the t<sils. The
misfortunate fellow’s light for life brought
the owner of the lawn-mower, in pyjamas,
and then the truth was revealed. A coil of
wire clothes-line that had been hung on a
hook had been dislodged, and had fallen
over the marauder. No housefather who has
had dealings with a coil of wire clothesline
needs further explanation-.

When Edward Ross Fairfax, “gentleman,
of Macquarie-stfeet, Sydney, and Tunbridge
Wells, England,” died at London on July
15 last, he bequeathed property in Aus-
tralia to his immediate relatives worth
£569,062. Although probate was granted
at Sydney on November 4 the daily papers
have made no mention of the fact. It was
unjust to thus overlook the benefactions of
the deceased. According to the last will
and testament of- the relative of the S. INI.
Herald he did not feel called upon to make
any bequests to charitable institutions,_ as
he had contributed largely to such organisa-
tions during his lifetime, and in proof he
modestly quoted this list: —
Prince Alfred Hospital .. .-.£500
Sydney News Boys . . . . ..... 400
y.M.C.A -..200
N.S.W. Deaf, Dumb and Blind Inst. .. 100
Sydney Female Refuge . . . . . . 100

Sydney Newsboys’ Brigade .. .. 100
Camden College . . . . . . • • 50
Bible Socy. (N. S. Wales branch) .. 50
N.S.W. Bush Mission 50
This made a total of £lB5O. That the
S. M. Herald didn’t mention such benefac-
tions out of an estate of a mere £569,062
suggests quite unnecessary modesty on its
part. As for the Telegraph, maybe it was
furious jealousy of the other family that
kept it from saying the great things a Fair-
fax had done.

THE VALUE OF MAGNESIA TO
DYSPEPTICS.
ITS ACTION EXPLAINED.
“Of inestimable value in all forms of
stomach trouble.” recently remarked an
eminent specialist when asked his opinion
upon the ever-increasing use of magnesia in
cases of indigestion, dyspepsia, heartburn,
flatulence, wind, etc.., but, of course, it must
be pure bisurated magnesia ; this is the form
invariably prescribed by physicians who
recognise that in many cases serious harm
might result from the use of other forms,
such as the acetates, citrates or sulphates
of magnesia. Most chemists no\y stock pure
bisurated magnesia in powder and tablet
form, and I would advise sufferers from any
form of stomach trouble to take half a tea-
spoonful of the powder or two compressed
tablets in a little water immediately after
each meal. This will instantly neutralise the
excessive acid in the stomach and prevent
fermentation of the food, thus ensuring nor-
mal digestion and freedom from discomfort
and pain.*

Camp. Broadmeadows,” and awaited an
answer in patience. He got it when the
missive was returned to him through the
Dead Letter Office on October 2,). I ■ost-
marks show that it was duly posted on May
12, and reached Seymour on the 18th.
Thence it went on a sort of grand tour,
touching at Cairo on the loth Zeitoun
on the 28th, Cairo again on the loth Aug-
ust, and other undecipherable places there-
after. Nobody interfered with it; it simply
mooched around the world, casually and
leisurely. Finally someone considered it
had mooched enough, and returned it to
Melbourne, whence the genius who directs
these tremendous matters returned it to the
writer instead of sending it to Broad-
meadows, where Tivey had been all the
while.

The old gentleman had asked for some
stories and the returned soldier was obliging
him. “There was a sniper who was doing
a letter damage and I goes after ’im. Just
as I sneaks over the rise he lets go and
smashes me bay’net. Running down the
gully was about 20 Turks, and I
goes after them and drops a
couple before they gets clear. Then
I comes back and lumme if I didn’t
walk fair on top of me sniper.
Bet yer life I put the bay’net into
him ouick and lively.” “But I
thought you said your bayonet had
been shot away,” said the audi-
ence. Billjim lit a cigarette.
“ ’Ere,” he snapped, “you asked me for
stories, but what you want’s a blanky argu-
ment !”
“T. 0.1.”: There are two churches in
Windsor (N.S.W.) named after St. Mat-
thew, one Anglican, the other R.C. The
former has just celebrated its 98th birth-
day, and is the oldest church in Australia.
The foundation-stone was laid by Governor
Macquarie on October 11, 1817. That stone,
by the way, was removed during the night,
and the holey dollar, which was below, was
stolen. The stone was relaid, hut when the
second coin was likewise stolen the parson
got tired of placing valuables underneath.
In those days there were no collections —
the Imperial Government did the needful
in cash matters. George IV., of very pious
memory, presented the bell which hangs in
St. Matthew’s tower. The pipe organ was
the first landed in Australia, and is in use
still.
A TRIAL SPIN.
The world at the present moment was a whispering
gallery.
The TELERAAF (Amsterdam) ridicules Germany's

“H.M.W.,” from a warm spot:—
Recruiting results and the Gallipoli performances
of the Bananalanders ought to do a bit to knock out
the mischievous yarns about our hot climates breed-
ing only degenerates. Ask any experienced camp
commandant, and he will tell you that the men of
the most magnificent physique are coming in,
especially to the Light Horse, from the Outback
plains. Hot climates, I am more than ever con-
vinced, breed as big and robust a type as do the
lukewarm and colder brands of weather; and the
shibboleths about certain climates not being fit for
white men must soon be thrown into limbo. It can
be hot enough here, where we are not far from the
big western plains, and our last physical degenerate
who enlisted, aged 20 years and four monhts, stood
6ft. 3in. in his socks, went lOin. round the chest, and
weighed 2001 b. And we have more of him.

“This dreadful war! They say me must all

“Yes, indeed; poor Fido’s chicken sand-
wiches are now made of rabbit.”
Norman K. Ewing’s appointment to the
Tasmanian Bench and the re-shuffling of the
Federal Cabinet cards in the same week will
remind old Westralian goldfields men of the
meeting of Ewing and Hugh Mahon (now
Minister for External Affairs) at Kalgoorlie,
in the consulship of Finnerty. Mahon, as
editor of the local paper, with a terrific
set on the quaint old Perth administra-
tion, used to launch hair-raising leaders at
the Forrest-Harper crowd who, up to then,
had never encountered anything stronger in
the way of criticism than G. F. Sala’s mild
comments in the Perth Daily News. Big-
john especially disliked Mahon’s slashing
style, and the first chance he got he went
for the pressman for criminal libel. So
-anxious was “Old Jack” to pot Mahon, whom
he dubbed “a d —d rebel,” that he dispatched
N. Iv. Ewing in place of the common or
garden Crown Prosecutor, because (1)
Ewing was then coming to the front as a
lawyer; and (2), like Forrest, he had a pri-
vate score to settle with Mahon’s paper. By
hook or by crook Mahon was to be “got.”
All sorts of rumors flew about the field ; it
was even said that the Crown tried to “pack”
the jury. But in those days to pack a jury
against a Goldfields’ champion was harder
to do than it would be to bribe Peter for a
free pass into Paradise. Mahon was acquitted
without the jury leaving for its usual drink
—a record in those days. Being himself a
Justice, the “d —d rebel” left the dock and
—stepped on to the Bench! The astounded
Ewing protested, whereupon he and his
friends were reminded that one Justice —-
under the then W.A. law —had power to
commit to gaol for “contempt,” and the hint
was passed round that if Ewing got really
savage Mahon, J.P., meant to order him
into custody. The idea of a Crown Prosecu-
tor being shot in appealed to all hands, and
if Ewing had not “tumbled” quickly, in he
would have gone! Ewing, very pale, for-
mally opened the “next case,” then handed
it and his papers over to a junior, and
cleared for Perth by the afternoon train.

“Mujik”: Now this yarn about a Mel-
bourne Cup dream is absolutely true. A
month before the race, while sleeping off my
daily debauch of tea, I was visited by a
severe-loolcing person in clerical clothes, who
took me by the arm and led me to the win-
dow. “Look, brother,” he said, and I looked,
and there, suspended in the distant atmo-
sphere, was the figure of a girl clad in a
diaphanous garment, and as the tail thereof
fluttered in the breeze the ghostly wowser
slowly spelled out, in a deep, sepulchral
voice, the letters of a word printed on the
celestial nightie—“M-a-r-c-u-l-f-u-s.” Won-
deringly I turned to my visitor, who, putting
a large, bony hand to his mouth, whispered
hoarsely in mv ear, “The straight griffin.”
Then he pulled a couple of wings from his
tail pocket, pinned them on his shoulders and
flew off like a bird towards the airy maiden.
They were hiding behind a cloud when I
woke. Next night my rest was disturbed by
a horrible nightmare, in which, carrying
George Reid on my back, I made the ascent
of Kosciusko in inky darkness. “Mountain
Knight,” I panted, when bathed in sweat I
dropped George at the top for supper, and
woke to find it was day. “Must be going to
have a dead-heat,” solemnly said Puntersby
when I told him next morning, and he rushed
off to ring up Ikey. But just then Pickem
happened along and remarked that his wife
had received a letter from her cousin in
Westralia announcing that her husband’s
niece, who lives in Queensland, had a friend
who said he had dreamed with great distinct-
ness seeing St. Carwyne win by half a mile.
Pickem said he was going to have his bit
on that. Now when the race was run these
three calamitous prads fell down on the way,
and everyone whom I had told about the
dreams spoke in terms of advanced fright-
fulness. Me? Oh, no. I didn’t lose any-
thing ! I didn’t back ’em. I thought I’d
wait and see how things panned out; and,
anyhow, I tumbled to it that my shadowy
rev. visitor was out hitting up biz for his
mates, the bookmakers.

Soldiers are still returning who vehem-
ently declare that the strictures of Dr.
Springthorpe on the management of the
Australian Red Cross in Egypt were abso-
lutely correct and more than
wholly justified. The Bul-
letin was assured this week
(and by no irresponsible pri-
vate) that one battalion had
practically no comforts for
four months, and he asserted
as a solemn fact that supplies
despatched from Australia on
some ships remained unloaded
and were returned in the same holds.

Dr. Golding Bird, Anglican Bishop of Ival-
goorlie, has just founded in London the
“Kalgoorlie Diocesan Association,” with
power to establish branches in Manchester,
Liverpool and other places, lie has got an
English prelate named Ryle as president, and
in that capacity Ityle has sent out a begging
letter to the British papers, headed “The
Needs of the Australian Goldfields,” and
assuring the charitable public that “the dio-
cese of Kalgoorlie is in urgent need of finan-
cial support and assistance.” When is the
Commonwealth going to suppress the circula-
tion of these stinking-fish advertisements by
gaitered mendicants in England?
SLOW BUT SURE.
JONES: “And he went out at twenty to one.”
OFFICER PUNTER (who hacked it) : “M’yes; and got hack at a quarter to two.”
“Tuppence Extra”: Whenever I come
across one of these exultant Yankee shrieks
about the financial supremacy of the world
passing automatically to the U.S.A., 1
wonder how much money without power
will be worth in the confused years that
will follow the war. The U.S.A. had the
luck to produce the man who wrote “The
Influence of Sea Power Upon History.”
9at it needs now is another genius to
write “The Influence of Sea and Land
Power Upon Finance.” The dollar is a
noble animal, but it can’t take care of
itself.

“Wingen” Abbott, the aged New England
(jN.b.vV.) squatter and inveterate newspaper
correspondent, caught a tartar when
he wrote a fevered criticism of the Necessary
Commodities Commission to S. M. Herald
on October 5. “The Crown” fired a
Supreme Court writ at him inviting him to
snow cause why lie should not be proceeded
against criminally for libel. The case was
heard before the Full Court, and was in its
way a judicial farce. There were three
Judges, two Iv.C's and live lesser legal
lights present to look as solemn as if there
really was an intention to prosecute Abbott.
He handed in a humble apology, which was
gravely intoned, and this was followed by
the chanting of the pained affidavits of the
libelled commissioners. Then the inquisition
unanimously agreed to accept the apology
aforesaid on condition that Abbott paid for
everybody’s beer.

I don’t want jumbles of figures proving nothing.
I believe that our volunteers are better than tlicir
long-service conscripts.
1 believe that our improvised strategy will prove
better than their long-matured plans.
I believe our diplomacy will achieve more than
their bribes.
I won’t listen to long stories about our muddling.
I won’t read long stories about our criminal care-
lessness.
I will give no encouragement to the Jeremiah of
the tram or train.
I refuse to believe that all the Red Cross com-
forts and stores go astray.
1 want to hear bands and see banners.
I believe in the Fleet, the Army, the Silver Bullet,
and all the rest of it.
I believe, most of all, the speeches and statements
our politicians make.
1 believe and hope for the sheer comfort of
believing and hoping.
1 believe that victory is incubated by patriotic
fervor.
1 don't want to be reasoned with, because reason
is only dry dust.
I admit I have no great reason for elation,

I am not troubled.
I am Characteristic of the Race.
I am British—-

COLONEL EDWIN THEY. D.S.O.
Kenneth M. 11. Solomon, son of the Syd-
ney City Treasurer, who, as lieutenant in
the lltli Gloucester®, died from wounds at
Gallipoli in September, was one of the most
promising of Australian poets. “Verses by
K.M.H.S.” showed the author to be a poet
with ideas, chaotic but original, and a tine
facility in expression. Ilis death, at the
age of 27. closes the promise of a brilliant
career. He was captain of Sydney Gram-
mar School, gained liis degree at Sydney
University, and was just completing his
course at the Temple when the war called
him.
Once when interpreting for Wi Peri in
M.L. Representatives David Francis (Ren-
ville Barclay, .iust dead, refused to translate
the last sentence of the speech. Wi. who
was violently protesting against the iniqui-
ties of a native land Bill, banged him on
the head with a volume of statutes and
roared at the Speaker in his best English.
"I say, ‘Go to Ilell, te pakeha” This
was in the old days. With the arrival of
Maori representatives like Apirnna Xgata
(barrister). Poinare, Hone lleke and Te
Rangihiroa the interpreter’s job became of
much less consequence. Stili Barclay, like
Jimmy Carroll and Bellamy’s and the' mace,
was an institution, and his death causes
widespread regret.

Ex-ITemier John Verran. miner and
“local preacher,” continues to hand out. to
S. Aus. Parliament his personal renderings
of Holy Writ. The other day he explained
in his own way how and why an Opposi-
tion member who had interrupted him was
no better than the ordinary crowd. “God
did not make you any different from other
people,” said this holder of all the Stable
Secrets. “He made you out of red clay, the
same as the rest. He threw it against the
wall, and said ‘Live!’ I might snv that
some people got very much disfigured in the
process.”
It is ipiite possible that Vie. Attorney-
General Mackinnon may be beaten at the
next elections by a mere law-clerk. At
Labor’s recent pre-election ballot at Prali-
mn, Mackinnon’s constituency, there were
seven candidates, the successful one being a
young man named Parker, cm l ‘l■,vod in the
office of solicitor Joseph Woolf. Of the
seven Laborites in the ballot, two had
opposed Mackinnon at previous elections,
and the Liberal majority had shrunk each
time. Since the South Yarra and Prahran
seats were amalgamated, and Mackinnon
entered the Assembly on a minority
poll leading by a few votes, Labor
has put up a different candidate at
each contest. Parker being the seventh.
The first of these was Edward Pus-
sell. now senator and Assistant Minis-
ter ; and the second was Martin Hannah,
now M.L.A. for Oollingwood. The third.
McCarthy, was killed while playing football
two or three years ago. On paper, the
Parker-Mackinnon engagement: looks like
being a close thing.
Benjamin Lee, who represented West
Maitland in the X.S.W. Assembly 51 years
ago, and was afterwards police magistrate
at Bathurst and stipendiary at Sydney for
some years, celebrated his OOth birthday

a private in a 1 )ragoon regiment, and was
all through the Peninsular War, and missed
Waterloo through being engaged in the
battle of New Orleans in America. He came
to N. S. Wales in 1829, settled at Parra-
matta in 1830, and died there in 1579, aged
91 years.
The latest of Adelaide’s vigorous patriarchs
to pass the SO-mark is Simpson Newland.
pioneer and pastoralist. Mis father, a farm-
ing preacher, settled in 1839 at Encounter
Bay. just outside the Murray mouth, and the
veteran of to-day has put many memories
of early times into a valuable though
rather stodgy novel, "Paving the Wav.” He
has been State Treasurer, and is now an
authority on all River Murray questions:
also he claims that S. Aus. would have had
its direct line through to Darwin long ago
if the Price-Peake Government bad not
frowned on bis plans for getting it done by
a land-grant syndicate. Among the Newland
sons are a leading Adelaide surgeon, an
Australian XI wicketkeeper, and a Rho-
desian settler, who had the chief hand in
arranging Roosevelt's big game tour.
AN • D. Murray, a unionist who was
rapidly making his way to the top of the
X.S.W. Labor tree, has had his climbing cut
short by a railway accident at Auburn'while
on his way home from a Sydney Labor Coun-
cil meeting. lie came from Belfast on
account of victimisation in that place, and
was able to supply Sydney unionists with
the Larkin viewpoint of the Larkin strikes ;
and ever since his prominence had been grow-
ing on council and conference, his straiglH-
out speech and firm adhesion to definite
Labor doctrines giving him the support of
the stalwarts. One thing he was very definite
about —his hostility to the introduction of
religious matters to political and industrial
affairs. He had seen the workers beaten
time after time by the good old business of
stirring religious differences in Ireland; and
he was a wholesome reminder to a party that
has been inclined lately to forget the old
principle.

ill children. The mother died recently, but
the father and the rest of tin 1 family still

offered a prize to the largest Australasian
family, and quoted an English journal’s
claim that the family of George Perkins, of
Hull —28 children —was the largest in the
Empire. After exhaustive research the
prize was awarded to Richard King and his
wife. Dick’s brother Bill, of the same
locality, proved himself almost as good a

Dead, as a result of an accident, Glenville
Barclay, of Wellington (M.L.). lie was
the eldest son of Captain W. de It. Barclay,
and for many years was Maori interpreter
lo the House of Reps. Probably there was
no one in the Land o’ Quakes who knew
more of Ilenare, his language, ancient lore
and traditions than “Pakare.” There are
many good translators—Alf Grace, for in-
stance —but very few of them can talk
Maori well. Glenville Barclay could do it
more than well: in the use of Ihe musical
language there are few Maoris who could
ha ve' equalled him.
Melbourne’s Art Gallery Trustees (lie
other day received a letter from an Austra-
lian sculptor suggesting that he should do a
bust of Henry Lawson In copper, bronze or
marble for the gallery. One of the trustees
promptly observed that he did not think “the
writer mentioned” had acquired such fame
that he was entitled to have his portrait in
the gallery. This was received with mur-
murs of approval, and the suggestion was
accordingly cast into outer darkness. Hav-
ing thus asserted the exclusiveness of their
Temple of Fame, the gallery guardians pro-
ceeded with the next business —a proposal
that Henry Gyles Turner, who acquired
fame by being general manager of a bank
that made a most disastrous smash in the
'!lo's, ruining thousands of people, and who
now happens to be chairman of the
Gallery Trustees, should be preserved
|n oils and given a niche in the
Temple. This was unanimously agreed to.

meeting, could not utter one squeak of pro-
test. Nor for that matter, could the Past —

The first member of a N.S.W. Legislature
to receive pay was probably Hanley Bennett,
of Tamworth. He was elected for Liver-
pool Plains in March, 1872, and sat in the
seventh, eighth and ninth Parliaments. IBs
first election came about curiously. The elec-
torate was made a convenience of to provide
a seat for “Slippery Charlie” Cowper in
December, 1869. Cowper held it for a
year, and then went to London as Agent-
General. Lewis Wolfe Levy, who had
big family interests in the district,
followed him. But the people were
getting tired of being made a convenience
of. and decided to select a local candidate,
they chose Hanley Bennett, a man in very
humble circumstances, and illiterate. He
consented to run on condition that those
who nominated him also maintained him.
Several business people agreed to do it. and
to the surprise of some of them. Bennett
was elected by a clear majority. The finan-
cial support' dropped off after a year or
so. and Bennett, who was re-elected in
1-575, got further and further in the
mire and was made bankrupt in May.
’76. But he came back smiling after
re-election, and sat until 1880, when he was
given a job as gatekeeper on the railway.
AN hen he was too old for that he found his
way into a public institution and died there.
“THE NAUGHTY BOYS.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A famous African battalion, known as “The
Naughty Boys, ' which is composed of ex-prisoners,
led the assault. As usual, when a desperate enter-
prise is afoot, they sprang forward a few seconds
after the artillery lire ceased. Despite dreadful losses
the line never faltered. When once at grips with the
foe they soon finished off the Germans. The battalion
will be mentioned in Orders of the Day.— Cable.

This bank didn’t bit hard enough when it
reduced its capital ; and afterwards it appar-
ently hadn’t the courage to hit again. So,
though there are nominally reserves of some
size, which ought to mean that all the capital
is intact and a good deal besides, the public
has always been able to buy the shares* at
several points under par. Had the capital
been cut down harder, a 7 p.c. div. would
have cost no more than one of 41 or 5 p.c.
does now; and there probably wouldn’t have
been such pressure put on the management
to raise the dividend another T p.c. Fur-
ther, it wouldn't have been necessary to stuff
profit away in order to replace capital lost
but not written off. However, it is not much
use talking now, though it is a fair tiling
to remember that the present reduction of
dividend is really in a measure due to the
former neglect to do the writing-down
thoroughly. Of course it wouldn’t have
saved the hank from showing diminished
profit. Had there been no war. Queens-
land’s exceedingly serious drought would
have cut into earnings. The remarkable
tiling is that it hasn’t cut more than a
couple of thousand pounds out of them.
And on top of drought has been the inter-
ference of the war with the meat-export
trade. It was unquestionably the proper
thing that the Governments of the Allies
should have first call on our meat surplus.
That, however, shouldn’t have meant any
serious interference with exchange business.
But as things were arranged, the Govern-
ment played into the hands of one or two
banks—and the Royal wasn’t one of them.
Ministers had, in short, to deal with matters
<>l which not one of them had any personal
knowledge, and they had their levs pulled,
just as Hughes has had his pulled over the
metals business.
But if the profits are not so good, the
balance-sheet figures show the bank to be
stronger:—

than £1,393,325 in advances (book value)

wide that it should give the depositor a very

isn’t calculated to give the shareholder much
profit. A bank with less than £3 of the

more than half of that held liquid, can't
expect: to make its shareholders very fat.

The half-year just ended took in the winter
months; and that partly explains the
shrinkage in the profit from the figures of
the previous term. But there is no visible
reason why the profit should be loss than
one-half of what it was. As a matter of
fact the £172,773 of the previous half-year
looks a good deal like a freak.
Wore the directors' pursuing a cunning
policy, it would he a most inopportune time
I > show a bloated return at the rate of over
•“3 p.c. p.a. on the actual capital, as was
done six months ago. It isn’t so easy to say
what a management’s policy ought to he in
a case, of this kind. And (what is of more
practical importance, perhaps) it isn’t so easy
to say what it is. For instance, there are
serious contingencies in this business. The
trade was never faced with so man? dan-
gers. Even if the worst of them are over-
come. the victory will cost a lot of money—
and for a good deal of it there won’t be any
receipts given. If. as seems highly nr.j-
bable, pubs are closed at six or seven or eight
o’clock, irrespective of their character, the
rent and capital value of hotel properties
will be cut very hard. Is the co. nroviding
for this? Is it stuffing a few tens of thou-
sands of profit up its sleeve, so that it may
presently write down the assets without
drawing too heavily on the profits of the
future? Or will the future have to carry
all the trouble, supposing trouble comes?
Until you know these things you don’t know
very much about this co. The published
accounts look all right; but they really leave
a lot unsaid, and in the nature of things
the management is not at all likely to sup-
ply the omissions. There is this to be noted,
certainly. Three or four years ago £350,000
of contingency reserves were brought to
light and capitalised, and the existence of
these hidden reserves shows that the policy
had been to provide for contingencies out of
undisclosed profits.
It has been a wonderfully lucrative busi-
ness. Look at this :

No new capital lias been got in from the
shareholders in the 10 years, so that all the
extra assets have come from surplus profits.
Tine, the capital has gone up in the time
tLom £900,000 to £1,787,500, but the
£887.500 has '‘all been bonus distributions.
►Still, as suggested just now, this isn’t a case
of the past governing the future. The future
is going to govern itself. And the leader
oi: the opposition is no longer a dear old lady
of uncertain sex who demanded impossible
things and was encouraged to keep on
demanding them and thus make quite sure
of getting nothing.

It is when you come to sit down quietly with
an old-established Australian co. like this
that you begin to realise, if you have never
done it before, bow splendidly the Australian
spirit has grown during the past 12 or 15
years. The United is 53 years old; and if
you look at the table you will see that, in
spite of a transfer of £20,000 to capital, the
loserves are now a good deal more than twice
what they were in 1902. Or this shows it
even better :—•

By 1900, after 38 years of life, the co. had
reached a premium income of £58.499. In
the subsequent 15 years it lias added £129,788
to those figures. So in the past 15 years it
bas_ got 21 times the new business it had
achieved in all the previous 38 years. And
tins hasn’t been due to any thorough reor-
ganisation. 011 the contrary, things with
the United have gone along in much the old
leisurely way. General-manager Tinley,
who died during the year, had been with
the co. for 52 years. Bartin Haigb, who
steps up one, was- secretary 20 years ago
and how many years before that this paper
doesn’t know. And George Judah Cohen and
1. 1. Knox and Richard Binnie, directors to-
duv. were directors in 1895. Legislation
lias no doubt done something for this and
other cos.; employers’ liability and accident
insurance have become very general. But
more important than all that in bringing
about these remarkable changes in the
figures is the growing confidence in Austra-
lian institutions; a growing belief that you
can t make Australia rich by making divi-
dends for someone to spend elsewhere. And
this war is going to push that truth still
further home.
incidentally, the growing disposition on
the part ot. Australians to advance Austra-
lia by dealing with Australian institutions
is bound to be exploited bv adventurers
This makes it the urgent duty of the Aus-
tralian Parliament to legislate so that wild-
cats may be kept out. Things are being
done at this moment iu the insurance field
which amount to a scandal. Any adven-
turer can put up a brass plate in Sydney
and call himself and his equally impecunious
friends the Perennial Insurance Co., and
make vague references to a million capital
and on 110 real capital whatever take insur-
ance risks running into hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds. People actually are doin<*
this thing in N. S. Wales at this moment,
mostly, of course, in country districts, after
caging a few well-known men to act as
decoys by offering them a handful of free
grains. With luck these people will pull
through, and may. in fact, make a lot of
money. Without luck, they won’t of course
lose anything, because they have nothing to
lose, but hundreds of cookies and others who
thought they were insured will find their
policies a delusion and a snare.
. first thing to look out for in con-
sidering a proposal to insure is safety Will
you get your money supposing you have to
make a claim? .Now. the security which an
insurance co. offers depends primarily upon
the proportion of its funds to its risks; and
, e i' lsks you can judge, in a general way,
by the premium income. Therefore con-
sider first what proportion capital and re-
serves combined bear to premium income.
CaSe ,°l, the United paid capital is
±120,000 and the reserves £231,780 after
current div. is paid; total £351,786 Pre-
miums were £188,257. So funds were 187
p.c. ot the year’s premium income. Anv-
thnig over 150 p.c. is good; anything over
uo p.c. very good. Anything less than 100
p.c. is bad. If a co. can’t show that it has
actually in hand an amount equal to the
previous vear’s premium income, it ou°lit to
be turned down. Actually in hand—it is well
t<- note that. The amount mustn’t consist
pothetical assets, but cash deposits,
public securities, mortgages and properties.
I'lie safer the co. the more plainly will it
sot out its assets: this one, for instance,
shows deposits £111,005, various Govern-
ment stocks £87,642, mortgages £36.060.
freeholds £<2,244. and so on.

4he profit is shown net "after providing for
depreciation, etc.”; but the amount of that
provision isn’t mentioned. Really therefore
it isn’t any use taking much notice of a
single line in the foregoing table: the only
safe thing to do is to take a general sulvey.
The most the figures do is to indicate the
trend of things. For the past two terms
it looks as though the directors want to
indicate that things have been distinctly
better. They certainly could afford to be.
Before that, apparently, the 7 p.c. dividend
had for several years been barely earned. A
10 years’ comparison makes things look even
less satisfactory. As at September 30 1905,
the co. owed only £2840 and had £43,950 in
cash and public securities. Now it owes
£4073, and practically the whole of the nest-
egg of cash has been put into ships, which
ought, of course, to be earning a lot more
than the money was bringing in when it
was on fixed deposit. Certainly profits are
better than they were, on the whole, 10 years
ago; but the difference isn’t -striking. This
clearly isn’t one of those fortunate ship-
ping cos. which can gradually builu up a
fleet out of undivided and mostly-undisclosed
profit. Possibly it may be doing a trifle
better than the table indicates; but if it had
been doing very much better, it wouldn’t
have had to use up all its liquid assets to
pay for the additions which have been made
to the fleet. As far as one can see. there
is bread-and-butter ahead; but The Bulle-
tin can’t find any reason to expect cases
of champagne to wash the bread-and-butter
down.

The directors put it in the director’s usual
involved way :■ —■
This balance-sheet is by far the most satisfactory
submitted since manufacturing commenced in 1886.
The larger surplus shown has been derived by reason
of the greater demand for the qo.’s goods, brought
about to a considerable extent by the abnormal
restrictions in the way of importers obtaining their
usual deliveries, and not from any inflation of prices.
The shareholders get 5 p.c. extra on their
capital, the employees get a 5 p.c. bonus on
their wages, and (according to this report)
the public pays no more for its goods, if
the directors can prove this point as to
prices, they will have got hold of one of
the strongest practical arguments in favor
of high Protection ever available in these
parts. For if “restrictions in the way of
importers obtaining their usual deliveries”
can add 5 p.c. to the return of capital and
5 p.c. to the return of labor, without adding
anything to the cost to the consumer, plainly
this is the thing the country is looking for:
and those restrictions can be imposed just
as well by a high tariff as by a German
submarine. The thing is quite feasible.
Apart from labor unrest the great trouble
of the average Australasian factory has been
the irregularity of the demand anil the high
cost of marketing and distribution. This
latter drawback has been even more pro-
nounced in Maoriland than in Australia. If
the Australasian market were secured to
the Australasian product, the manufacturer
could afford to specialise, with advantage to
himself and his customers; and the specialist
would get the business iu his particular line
without chasing it at the present very heavy
cost. The consumer would benefit in regard
to price as well as quality, because competi-
tion would inevitably disturb a concern
which was showing 25 p.c., as this one did
last year. What we want to aim at is a
condition which will allow a manufacturing
co, to earn a steady 9or 10 p.c. or so. With
our present tariffs a co. lias to starve its
plant horribly in order to pay -1 or 5 p.c. one
year, and a few years later, there being no
internal competition to speak of. up rush
the profits to 30 p.c. when foreign com-
petition is temporarily shut off. That the
lean years of this co. have been much more
numerous than the fat years can be judged
by the circumstance that, after just a third
of a century, the reserves amount to less
than £43,000. though., the dividends have
often been mighty poor. The Bulletin
could name a dozen .concerns which either
cut up land and sell it or handle imported
goods which have done far better than that
in one-sixth of the time.

That table < <>v< is practically all the life of
the present co., which was built on the wreck
of a predecessor. At that time it was still
uncertain how the balance of the old pro-
perties on hand would pan out, so when the
assets were revalued the capital was fixed
at only £90,331, or £2(i.4SS less than the
total net valuation of the assets. That
surplus was accordingly available for
reserves. Instead, however, of this fund being
drawn upon to make good any losses on the
sale of assets at prices below the written-
down book value, surpluses were realised,
and the reserves were thus added to. For
some years the surpluses realised were
shown as profits on sales,, but this line has
of-late years disappeared from the accounts:
and, as it is simply incredible that the pro-
perties sold have realised exactly hook value,
either the profits have been lumped with
other earnings or an invisible or contin-
gency reserve has been established. As the
properties are now practically all sold, this
fund may be now brought into the light:
on the other hand, it may be kept up the
directors’ sleeve to provide for any losses
that may bo made on securities which may
in future fall into the co.’s hands. Hidden
reserves don’t, of course, sound well; but in
practice they turn out all right. Without
them depositors would certainly often he
quite unnecessarily ruffled, and tiie credit of
a thoroughly sound concern would be in
danger of being impaired.

Capital meantime has gone from £96,351 to

erate. Deduct the cash from the deposits,
etc., and you get net liabilities of £71.449:
and the advances represent 31 times that
amount. Further, they are no "doubt all or
nearly all advances on building society
terms, which means that solid repayments
have been made since the period of excessive
values two or three or four years ago; so
that even if excessive advances were then
made the security should be quite good now.
As for profits., the 7 p.c. dividend is earned
and a fine margin besides. But how it is
done is a bit of a puzzle. It almost looks
as if some of that undisclosed profit on sales
previously referred to has been dropping into
the general profits of late years, though the
accounts don’t admit it.

Old Burra copper mine (S.A.) is up for
.ale and although this tamous copper
bonanza produced £3.000,000 worth of cop-
pe! A isn’t likely to realise a Inghpnce
The co. formed in 1901 did 110 good, the old
workings proving wet in the deepest levels
and rather barren. The Burra from 1840
to 1877 produced 234,648 tons of ore, much
of which assayed 20 p.c. copper. Costs
were heavy, especially m the very early
da vs when the crude ore Avas carted 100
miles to Port Adelaide. Still it paid hand-
somely even then. Mining men generally
consider the Burra to be a basin-like deposit
formed by intersecting lodes. Geological
reports are emphatic about lode channels,
•md hold out considerable encouragement to
a mining co. that is prepared to spend money
in sinking. # »
The C’ooronga Oil Lands Go.’s prospectus
reads like a chapter from “Monte Cristo.’
Pour pages are full of AA’hat Kockotellei,
D’Arcy and Tom Whaley have done, but
precious little about Avhat the Cooronga Co.
is going to do —except as to the distribution
of "the money it hopes to receive from the
public. Out of 125 shares for sale at £lO
the vendors are taking £750 cash as well as
getting £2OOO Avortli of scrip. That leaves
£5OO for what the prospectus naively
describes as “the expenses of flotation and
the usual brokerage.” The. Cooronga Co.
does not even mention precisely where its
areas are, though it hints in the fifth para-
graph that they are “within 10 miles of a
splendid port,” and it. seems proud that it
is in the vicinity of Petroleum Concessions,
Petrolia. North Petrolia, Austral Conces-
sions, Murrabinea Oil Concessions and
Kingston Petroleum Territories, all similar
companies holding prospecting search
licenses for oil. Why don’t all these small
syndicates amalgamate and thus raise
cash to put down a bore? If they Avon’t do
it people are bound to say that the pro-
moters have more faith in getting something
out of the public than out of the earth.
11. C. E. Muecke, of Adelaide, very Avisely
goes oil the Broken Hill Prop. Board, of
Avhich he was an accidental chairman Avlien
the war broke out. He has long been Ger-
man Consul iu the most German State in
Australia, and the big metal co. was liable
to be prejudiced by such a one being on its
Board. 11. Y. Mac Kay, the agricultural
machinery maker, brings in an entirely neAV
sort of experience. Valuable experience,
too, it should be, in view of the co.’s steel
undertaking.
“G.D.M.”: The Australian iron industry
needs a scientific series of Customs duties, and
when we get that Ave’ll make our own fencing
wire, pig, bar, hoop, ingot, plate and sheet
iron, pipes, tubes, rails, fishplates ; also our
own guns and rifles. And to the Mount Lyell
ought rightfully to belong the duty of making-
iron and steel at Burnie (Tas.) from the
Blythe River deposit. The creation of
another great steel-making corporation will
need a big man and a big capital. Mount
Lyell Co. possesses both. Why should it;
not undertake the task? Blythe River may
not have the 21,000,000 tons of iron ore iu
sight at the Broken Hill Prop.’s Iron Knob
(S.A.), yet its compensation is that near by
are coal for coke and big beds of limestone.
Bowes Kelly ought to make this the crown
uf his life’s work. In no way could he do
more for Australia.
“Weston”: “A Bulletin man at Wes-
toiiia” (B. 14/10/T5) states that the
methods proposed to sink the shaft at Edna
Deeps, by forcing the water out of the coun-
try rock and filling the cracks with cement,
have been successful elseAvliere. Will he
kindly give instances? Instead of spending-
money 011 a second-hand battery to crush
ore not yet developed, AA’liile playing cement
down the main shaft, the co. should put up
a decent head-gear and pumping plant to
enable the diamond drill core results to be
proved.
One of the largest unsecured creditors has
acquired Chaffers (W.A.) from the liqui-
dator. and proposes to first let it on tribute
and then try to form a neiv co. and give it
another go. Less than a year ago, when the
“wild dog” management Avas in full swing,
Vail (Lake View and Star) reported on the
property for his co. After au exhaustive
sampling he came to the conclusion that there
were 93,162 tons of ore in sight, worth 295.
per ton. Working exes, and cost of develop-
ment he reckoned would average 275. per ton,
and losses in treatment an additional 35.;
so that for every ton of ore mined and treated
he figured on a loss of Is. That
summed up the mine in a few words. He
admitted, however, that a considerable ex-
penditure on development might enable a
profit to be made on 295. ore, but there was
no certainty about it, nor was it at all sure
that the expenditure could be recovered.
•If * * *
Payne’s Find (W.A.) still perseveres.
The last half-year’s accounts show a profit
of £155 on a revenue of £2594. Liquid assets
are a mere £866, including £2OO stores.
Against this there is a debt of £6296. It is
true the co. has a calling power of £7223 and
7000 reserve shares which are given a book
value of £3500, but neither of these assets
would count for much if the co. got into diffi-
culties. Something is said in the manager’s
report about ore in the shafts assaying from
30dwt. to 30z., and that there “should be
1000 tons of 25dwt. stuff in one particular
block of ore,” but no definite estimate of
reserves is given. Chances are not good.
* ■ * * *
Black Range Co. (W.A.) is still turning
its Sandstone mine to profit. Last month’s
surplus was £lBBl. There is estimated to
be 1400 tons raised and 50,000 tons in sight
below the surface of its newly-acquired
Pinnacles show, and the erection of plant is
about to begin.
* If * *
Alec Peacock signs the Edna May Deeps
circular with regard to raising
but he isn’t the architect of the scheme. He
is too canny to want to jump up a register
from 60,000 to 100,000 shares, if only be-
cause of the extra office work it means.
Most Victorian no-liability concerns when
needing money simply increase the amount
callable on each share. The Deeps Board,
instead, goes for 40,000 new shares divisible
pro rata among present holders if they care
to apply. This looks like trying to hit up
the bears. If no calls can be made on pre-
sent shares the bears cannot use such calls
to straighten out their position. All the
same, they will recover cash over the rights,
and they know also that once the last 9d.
is called upon the current issue, 20,000
paids will come in as good delivery scrip,
making 60,000 shares available to square
deals instead of 40,000. The market apart,
there isn’t much to be said in favor of the
new issue. If ss. per share will cover all
outgo till the co. gets on to profits, the five-
bob new scrip will rank equally for divs.
Avith the old 10s. paid contributing shares.
The men who put up 10s. each on the orig-
inal float Avon’t like that, the more when
they see the new shares called first in the
market. If there should happen to be a
knock-out, the old holders will be on to the
loAvest plane before they get the right to
deal. Manager Stuckey estimates £7500 will
erect plant and sink the Deeps shaft as far
as he wants to go. So far his scheme for
cementing out the water has acted, but he
has 90ft. of fractured ground to get through,
and it would take a palmist to say what
will happen on the Avay.
Lancefield (W.A.) looks like being turned
to profitable account by the Kalgoorlie mine
managers’ syndicate which recently acquired
it. Returns for August and September
aggregated £17,000-odd, and the profit over
working exes. Avas £5OOO. A big surplus is
still required to recoup the syndicate for its
outlay, but Avith an estimated ore reserve of
250,000 tons and big sections of the lode still
to be opened up in the bottom levels, this
should not be hard to get, particularly as
some of the best mining brains in the State
are at Avork on the show.

A tale of Western sin:—
The present sporadic activity of the Goldfields
C.I.D. in scoring- convictious against gold-stealers
from the mines holds up to ridicule the system of
search. The underground men, who have to go
through a methodical examination, probably during
a Avhole year’s work never see a color, though the
stone may be pretty rich. But the workers in
treating plants have an opportunity of getting away
with the stuff in lumps, yet through some quaint
provision do not have to submit to the indignity of
examination. In the “good old days,” when there
was plenty of free gold showing in the face, how
many wore the schemes devised to collect some of
the curse! The best “joke” in our mine AA-as per-
petrated by a chap avc used to call “Grunter.” He
was a very unsociable cuss, and to any question,
civil or otherwise, his only answer Avas a grunt.
Hence his name. The searcher, a garrulous old
Cousin Jack, tried vainly to get a “pitch” on Avith
him, but AA'as always answered in pig’s language.
One of his Avorking mates, after some months of
this, bet his friends a fiver he Avould make
“Grunter” articulate. When meeting him at crib-
time that night, all his advances and taunts re-
ceded the same answer, till he connected “Grunter’s”
jaw Avith a dirty left. That loosened “Grunter’s”
tongue all right. It also loosened from its hiding
place a 4oz. slug of gold, Avhich prevented his free
speech and also explained . his taciturnity.
“Grunter” had reckoned that, if he never opened his
mouth to speak, nobody would suspect anything
when he kept his mouth shut to hide something.
Fred Tricks’s old mine, the Npav Loch
Fyne, of Matlock, near Woods Point (Vic.),
is to enjoy a second advent under John
Friel, the man who helped in the resurrec-
tion of George Dickenson’s Al. This time
the Loch Fyne will don the tartan of James
Mackay’g Queen-street, clan. It is vouched
that, “since the geological features at the
mine are similar to the Al and Rose of
Denmark mines, Gaffney’s Creek, there can
be little doubt that, as in these mines, the
ore occurrences remain permanent and will
maintain values at a depth.” This is about
as clear as mud. As the record of the New
Loch was 118,000 tons for £304,000 of gold
and £109,000 divs., the old Tricks crowd
wouldn’t have given up the show if the ore
occurrences had remained permanent. They
quitted because they couldn’t lay hands on
any more payable stuff above No. 4 adit,
and there wasn’t enough cash floating around
to take the dyke in bulk and shove it
through the battery on a huge scale. Want
of support also kept them from going-
deeper, and gave John Friel and his brother
the chance to pick up the plant and mine
for an old song. Seeing how the Al has
developed, James Mackay has every reason
for giving the Loch Fyne another run,
though he mustn’t talk about permanent ore
occurrences when nearly every vein or floor
has independent existence.
The whisper goes round that George
Dickenson, flushed with profits from the
Al, is shaping the old Morning Star al
Woods Point into form for a post-Cup car-
nival float.
From Mr. D. Murray, chairman of the
Langi Logan South: —
I have not at any time expressed an opinion as to
the course, before it enters the Langi Logan South
'Mine, of the Oathcart Central lead, adverse to the
direction shown in the plan lately issued and
referred to by you last week ; nor have 1 stated that
the lead would not go through portion of the New
Langi Logan property.
The Oaks (Q.) makes out a very
good case for the modest increase of
capital the directors are asking for. It
owes £2265 on mortgage debentures, and as
these mature in Sept., 1916, something will
then have to be done, anyway. The idea
is to offer present holders 5000 £1 shares
issued as paid to 65., and with the proceeds
pay off the debt and among other things put
iu another live head of stamps. Even with
the 10 head a fair profit has been made from
2dwt. lOgr. ore —a remarkable achievement
for Queensland —and there is certainly a
very big body as good as that and probably
at least a dwt. better.

Mount Shamrock, in the Maryborough
district (Q.), is to have another trial, a local
syndicate having taken it on. This show
has had several tests, and has produced a
good deal of gold, but the ore is refractory,
containing bismuth as well as gold and sil-
ver. It was at one time the only place
where telluride of bismuth was identified,
though possibly now it does not play a lone
hand in that respect. There is a 10-head
battery, with Wilfley tables and cyanide
plant, and a ton of concentrates recently
obtained from 100 tons of ore returned llOoz.
gold, lOoz. silver, and 10 p.c. bismuth, w’hich
is valuable just now. ~ If every 100 tons of
ore would do this, and the supply was equal
to the demand, the resurrection of the Sham-
rock should bring credit and renown, also
cash, to its instigators. Dunstan, Govt.
Geologist of Queensland, was at one time
interested in the property and held a very
high opinion of it.

Assistant-Geologist Hills holds out little

Mount Stronach might be worth prospect-

On the other hand he thinks that at the

are worth developing on a much bigger scale.

The deepest gold mine in the world, the St.

cent, on its capital for the year, a consider-
able sum being held in hand till the share-
holders decide whether they are going to test
values below “horizon 20.” They have a fine
large way of alluding to different levels in the
Sf. John as “horizons,” and “horizon 20” is a
bit over a mile and a Sheffield distance
down. This is a long way to drop cash if
“horizon 21” proves a duffer. It is fre-
quently quite unnecessary to go so deep to
lose money.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine per-
fume added, a,nd some Puritol wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat and
dust. Its healing effect is well known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of ruritol
Wax Soap.* [1

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November S, 1915.
My Dear Ari.vi. —
This is from Carrie Swain, whom every
theatre-goer in Australia knew 20 years ago;
After all this time, talking to Australia again—-
it seems so strange, so unexpected. Yet I had to.
Every day from rny home here in Paris T go, like
most Avomen who have the time, into the hospitals.
Yesterday I saw a red cover, so familiar; it
brought me running to it. Behind it was as
splendid a Cornstalk as ever lifted a idfle to an
enemy, and I knew he was my brother, and straight-
away sat beside his cot and handed over all the
cigarettes I had. Then we chatted and laughed, and
were as happy as two children out of school, living
over again our days in Australia.
How bravely he and the other big brown men have
been fighting! What splendid manhood, what fine
courage!! I am proud of them, and long to give
that personal encouragement that counts for so much.
Cor the wounded among the brave soldiers of the
country which has been my home for 20 years 1
have given many concerts, and have convalescents
with me at my house iu groups, and then I am
indeed happy at their sweet, honest appreciation,
and we part as though we had known one another
all our lives and would soon meet again. God
grant that we may!
France is not the bright, happy land it was. You
rarely see people laughing. Only the English
soldiers’ seem merry and gay. The whole French
population appears to have suddenly become serious.
Even in appearance; everybody has laid aside light
and gay colors. The men have discarded even straw-
hats. On the national fete day there was something
sublime in the quiet dignity with which the French
passed their annual holiday. No music; no singing;
no dancing; no shouting; no noise. Only the occa-
sional displaying of flags and the quiet crowds of
families in the streets.
During the last few days a new feature
has come upon tl.e city. Thousands of sol-
diers from the firing-line, after nine months’
fighting, have been given four days’ leave
to return to wives and mothers. Brown and
war-beaten men with torn and faded coats every-
where. There is something in the lines of their
faces that tells you they are determined to win.
They seem to have grown so old.
How could the city but be stern? To-day I saw
five soldiers together with only five legs, and some
of the wounds are beyond description.
I was overwrought and needed a few days’ rest.
But where to go? Finally I thought of Jean and
his wife who, after 30 years’ service with one family
who are my friends, had put their savings away in
a little house near the sea where they take in a
guest or two. The good couple’s pleasure in greet-
ing me was almost pathetic. But Avhere was their
hoy, just 20 —-their one happiness and hope?
Promptly on the call to arms he had gone to the
Front with his battery, and every ten days some
brief, humid scrap in pencil came home to tell them
all Avas well. Months passed in this accustomed
regularity. Then the ten days lengthened into 20,
and finally a month without any tidings....
After a while the father went to an old desk, and
with trembling hands handed me an envelope. It
was in their boy's handwriting and said: “This is
my wish. Dear Parents, I desire this envelope not
to he opened except in ease you Avill be without
news from me for more than a month or you have
heard of my death. Charles.”
“Read within,” the old man said ; and was there
ever a more touchingly beautiful farewell message
from a son to his devoted parents
“These lines are my last thoughts and my supreme
adieu to my dear parents whom I adore. 1 have
always loved you more than I have been able to
tell, and if at times iu the misguided moments I
have strayed from your love I admit it to-day and
ask your forgiveness. Rest certain, my dear and
beloved parents, that if I die I will fall bravely for
France and our beautiful country. Receive from your
son who loves you fondly many kisses and remember
these two words which I send in embracing you—Du
Courage!—Charles.”
To-day I am back from a pilgrimage to Mailly on
the Marne, and there we left all the Union Jacks and
french flags we could get on the little mounds of
the dead soldiers —for maybe among them was many
another Charles.
The first orchestral concert here under
conductor Verbrugghen had to be housed in
the ToAvn Hall. The Conservatorium is
much too small for a great occasion. A
bulging eroAvd Avaited for the opening bar
of “God Save.” Verbrugghen struggled
through the platform, tossed a mop of hair
that seemed to be strands of electric Avires,
bowed to the Quality on the vice-regal
patch, and let it go. Our dull old National
Anthem brought a rare thrill. The Bel-
gian Anthem —a joyous lilt —shook a storm
of applause from the house. Then the small,
lithe figure in the conductor’s pen settled
down to serious business and Beethoven.
Verbrugghen conducts with a long, wand-
like baton, an empty hand and every nerve
in his body. He cajoles and inspires his
•orchestra. Light and shade are as deli-
cately Avorked out in sound waves as the
(color scheme of a Avihl rose. At the close
of Beethoven's big Symphony in C Minor
the Belgian had to return to his stand to
avaa’c an exhausted arm toAvards his fiddlers
in ans Aver to “hurrahs” from ail over the
hall.'
The Fergusons and the Stricklands sat on
their leather and cane thrones. Excellency
Helen’s ostrich plumes were the centre of
the circle, with the small, bare patch in
Premier Holman’s thick crop to its left. Min-
ister Arthur Griffith’s spectacles hashed
alongside the unmusical Governor Stride
lands polite efforts to look cheerful. James
Chalmers, of Farmer’s, just back from
a trip on the other side, has lost
his once-flowing moustache in his travels.
A small, trim ornament noAV bristles
on this Symphony patron’s upper lip.
Judge Backhouse Avas in the central block—
the place Avhere the finest vieAv of Verbrug-
ghen’s back hair, mostly standing on end
Avhen he conducts, acted as a music barom-
eter.
When it Avas all over, Warwick, the regis-
trar of the Conservatorium, pushed to the
front and announced nicely that, as more
than n thousand people had been turned
aAvay. the Avonderful thing Avould be repeated
in aid of Allies’ Day.
The Poores have lost their only son, Roger,
in the fighting line. And Lady Poore, whose
witticisms used to snarkle over the teacups
at Admiralty House, has no daughter to con-
sole her. The son missed a naval career
OAA'ing to occasional eye-trouble, so tea-
planting in Ceylon Avas the alternative.
Throwing up his peaceful billet to do his bit
at the Front, he met the fatal bullet.
On Allies’ Day the Carnival in Moore-
street and Martin-place will get to business
at 7 p.m. Pavilion traders will start un-
packing at 4 a.m. on that date —November
19. The early AA’orm will have no chance
that day. Mrs. Jim OnsloAV, Mrs. Tom
Knox and Miss Eadith Walker Avill be
among the multitude to fasten on their
aprons. This little lot Avill sell fresh eggs
and unrivalled butter in the Italian pavilion.
There was a live meeting at the Palace
Theatre to incubate an Allies’ Day matinee.
Visitors crept warily up the marble steps
to the foyer, and got to business forthwith.
Stanley Jones Avas in the chair, and soon
the skeleton began to take on flesh. The
slioav itself will he housed at the Palace,
where damsels dressed in Indian togs
will raid susceptible males for spare
threepences on the afternoon of November
11. Mrs. Joynton Smith’s Indian Pavilion
gets the benefit of this affair.
Amy Castles can’t get across the border
in time for the Allies’ Day concert; but
Peter Dawson and Ella Caspers are likely
to be amongst the chirpers.
Lord I-lo Ave Island has done its bit for
Allies’ Day. The tiny speck has sent a load
of giant palms for the Belgium stall. Avhich
the decorative Michaelis lady is mauageress-
ing. Curator Maiden is housing them at the
Botanical Gardens till the 19th.
NeAvs of the death at the Front of Major
Bernard Head has saddened many Maori-
landers. The Major was English, but came
almost each year to climb the suoav heights
of M.L. He Avas there, when the hounds
bayed, and Avont in charge of the first batch
to" Samoa. Returning aftenvard to Eng-
land, he rejoined his Territorials.
The same mail made some souls glad by
fetching neAvs of the engagement of Roma
Hope, a grand-daughter of Canterbury’s
sheep-king pioneer, Charles Tripp, and great
grand-daughter of Bishop Harper, Miss
Hope, full of faith and charity, went to
London to nurse soldiers in a probationary
Avay at St. Thomas’s. The lucky male is
Major Drummond Spencer Smith (I don’t
think I’ve left out anything). Avho was at
one time on the war-staff in Maoriland.
Lieutenant Banjo Paterson, who goes
with the remount brigade to Egypt, may be
joined there by his curly-lieaded Avife. She
is a favorite cousin of Miss Eadith Walker.
They once went round the globe together
find agreed all the way. Dr. Shellshear, of
Albury, who leaves very soon as Major of
Field Artillery, will also have his wife
handy in Egypt; and so will Major Wil-
liams, of the same noisy arm.
The Dmsional Ammunition Column,
Avhieh has been gathered from the four
corners and is in camp at Albert Park, Mel-
bourne, Avill have its damages attended to
by Dr. St. Vincent “Welch, of Neutral Bay.
Artist Ethel Stephens is in charge of the
Voluntary Aids of Darlinghurst. Rose Hall
Convalescent Home is the soldiers’ hive there-
abouts. There the Aids flourish the duster
and bang the dust-pan o’ mornings, or, in a
second relay, fall into housemaids’ gloves in
the afternoon. Miss Fox, the matron, who
is honorary and residential, has Mrs. Sher-
wood, Avife of the Police Superintendent, to
help her mother the boys. Matron Fox
belongs to a Bananaland family that once
lived out Roma way. A brother —noAV dead
—used to sit in the northern Assembly.
Voluntary cooks are not all amongst the
atrocities of war-time. Some of the women
who are grilling their complexions to feed
the returned soldier hold Tech. College cer-
tificates. Miss Sherwood, an “emergency”
at Rose Hail, is one of these capable damsels,
The Kangaroo has some compensations for
being talked to and sung at Avhen he is too
Aveak to defend himself.
Woolwich, Avliich has a convalescent sojers’
home, has carefully thought out a masterly
scheme of home defence. Should any of
the patients become too obstreperous for
the slender authority of the voluntary aids,
two honorary male helps are to be rung tip!
One is a small man. the other a lieavy-
Aveiglit. Woolwich expects the bantam to
get in first and sit on the patient Avhile the
solid partner is ambling towards the dis-
turbance. Up to the present, the Heroes
have not been Avanted.
Gladys OAven has given up sketching-trips
for a Avhile. Red Cross and similar good
AA’orks give her brush a rest. Unlike most
of the cult, Gladys is free from anxiety
about earning her breakfast before she eats
it. Artist Dorothea Barclay -is also able
to take things easy at her special line of
business —sculpture. So she is making a
monumental success of the voluntary aid’s
broom.
Dr. Elsie Dalzell, the clever Sydney
graduate, has been doing forceful Red Cross
AA’ork on the other side. When last heard
of she AA r as in Servia. Rut that Avas before
the Balkan knot tightened. Still, it is quite
likely that the Kangaroo who hops that
Avay Avill meet the Sydney woman in one of
the base hospitals in Peter’s amazing little
kingdom.
Two of the Fourdrinier family, formerly
of A ictoria, and more lately of Sydney, have
been damaged in the fighting line". One Avas
hit in the head in France. The other was
more seriously Avounded in the spine at the
Dardanelles. A sister, Florence, expects to
welcome home the Dardanelles man and
nurse him back to health. The brothers
met in a London hospital. A forebear, one
Paul Fourdrinier, by the way, made himself
disliked in France as a leader in a Huguenot
row, so the family drifted over to England.
Tom Dixson, of the tobacco millionaires,
is noAV a dashing lieut. in the Coldstream
Guards. All Guardsmen are supposed to
dash, I understand. The plump and pretty
Mrs. Tom, , who used to pour out tea at
Redleaf, Double Bay, has taken a house near
the English Windsor for a Avhile.
A Newcastle man, Percy Cotter, who used
to throw out his chest in the R.A.N.R., has
recently been navigating officer on lhe hos-
pital ship Loyalty. This craft was given
by an Indian Maharajah, and transferred
Australian wounded to England. The
N.S.W. Cotter hoav has a commission in the
Royal Naval Reserve.
The patch of herbage in front of the
RandAvick Hospital for soldiers wants clean-
ing up. The authorities hope that there
Avill be a rush of able-bodied football bar-
raekers to do the job.
Writing from Calais Dr. Kate Ardill says
she has been put on the medical staff of the
Anglo-Relgian Hospital. Surgeon Frederick
Treves Avas responsible for the appointment.
The Sydney Avoman is the only petticoat
with a stethoscope on the premises. In a
recent visit to Wimereux, Dr. Katie, whose
parent has been in charge of Sydney soup
kitchens almost since soup Avas invented,
met Dr. Edye and Dr. Macdonald, who
used to he at Prince Alfred Hospital here.
The Austin Chapmans’ good-bye to a
brace of fighting sons happened on the
most sizzling night of last week. Ice-
creams dripped languidly on glass platters
while dancers in khaki panted round the
ballroom. The strapping boys, Lieuts. Jack
and Jim. had a number of pals iu the
fashionable buff raiment to keep them com-
pany. About 250 plates were laid for
supper. The menu cards were decorated
Avith the brothers’ photos.
A “gift afternoon” for nurses at the
Front had the bad luck to strike a red-hot
afternoon; so Society wilted, for the most
part, behind its closed shutters, while the
plain citizeness unfurled her gingham and
stamped to the Garden Theatre. Mrs. Hugh
Ward sang, and a succession of heroic per-
formers did their bit to gain limp applause.
At the end of the party the company for-
tified itself Avith light refreshments.
The French-Australian League of Help is
the old original patriotic firm. Avith Miss
Soubeiran as hon. secretary. It asks you
for help in the way of Avarm winter cover-
ing for the women and children of desolated
North France this coming Avinter.
At the Red Cross club-rooms the other
afternoon Mrs. Read, Avife of a N.S.W.
doctor in Egypt, confided that the distribu-
tion of comforts in the Nile country was
dreadfully muddled at first; but mistakes
were already getting adjusted when she
packed up for home a feAV weeks ago. The
wounded Kangaroo at first had to convalesce
in either violent purple pyjamas or “shorts.”
In the former he made such a dazzling sil-
houette that the authorities crossed off
pyjamas as Avalking attire. She didn’t think
these garments could have come from Aus-
iralia. Then up and spoke a Town
comforts worker. She broke the ne\v •
gently : “They did come from Australia— -in
fact, we made them up in Sydney.
authorities had dropped a hint, it seems, u
steer clear of too many pink and blue rags.
Hence the plunge into Imperial purple.
After the shock had been absorbed the meet-
ing -ended like a State-school bun-ngnt.
"Hands up those who want tea!”
East Maitland has recently let itself go in
a decorative wedding. St. Peter s was
turned into a Gothic arbor filled with palms
and lilies. The bride Avas Madge, eldest
daughter of Mrs. S. A. Alcorn. Ivory shim-
mer under a cloud of Brussels lace was the
finery which the bridesmaidens shook out
as the Best Girl stepped up to the altar.
Dr. S. A. Alcorn handed the heroine over to
Pendennis, a son of the late F. H. Richards,
of Cornwall.
The large and placid Margaret Vinton, of
the late Potash Co., was in a Criterion box
to see “A Pair of Sixes” the other night.
As soon as the lady’s golden topknot
appeared, the gallery gave it a vociferous
welcome. On the stage, Florence, a Heaven-
horn humorist, swept her way through the
machinations of a comic housemaid’s part.
It was rather a poor part in the U.S. play.
But the Australian girl practically raised it
into “lead.” Florence is one of the few
young women who don’t mind making up as
a semi- toothless, begrimed fright. In a
rusty black frock, bursting open in front,
with a grubby apron, and a cap about the
size and color of a turnip that has fallen in
the coal-box, she was more like the London
slaveydom of Dickens’s days than any pre-
sent product of Woody Wilson’s country.
“Rosna’s” cooee from London :
There's a scheme afoot to organise five concerts a
week throughout the long, dull winter at every hos-
pital in or near London where Tommy ’Boo is in-
carcerated. Australian artists in London are offer-
ing their best notes in the good cause, and
Carlyle Smythe is keeping an experienced eye on
the proceeding. There is to he a committee of the
noise-makers themselves, with Ada Crossley in the
chair, so if l’te. 'ltoo starts talking arpeggios and
second movements when he comes marching home
again you’ll know who to blame.
A little Birdwood girl, daughter of the General
whom the Australians at Gallipoli unanimously
vote a “real decent cove,” is the only non-Australian
on the staff at llarefield Park, the Australian hospital
for Tommy. She is an unaffected, jolly youngster
and a general favorite —a good deal more than half
an Australian herself by now, she says. The boys in
hospital pin their best faith to the General, who
apparently knows the entire Australian army by iis
Christian name, and has even made some progress
with its slanguage.
The big-1 tinged baritone, Malcolm McEaoh-
ern, has asked Hazel Doyle to be Mrs. Mac.
She voted with the Ayes. Violinist Bessie
Doyle, Avho used to fiddle so deftly on this
side, is Hazel’s auntie; ar.d the McEachern’s
young fiancee is also given to musical
enthusiasm.
Lottie Dearn and her eldest sister Allie
are back from Europe. They tvere round-
ing off their music in Leipsic when the
enemy showed his claws. They got intact
to London, where Lottie resumed work
under the mane of Mark linmbourg. In
spite of his technique Mark used to slam-
bang the piano too heartily for most people’s
taste. Of late years he has adopted a more
soothing attitude. Mnvbe he found the old
style too expensiA r e. They say a piano used
to last him only three months.
Australian-born Justine Kong Sing Avrites
that she has been holidaying in the Bronte
country amongst Yorkshire moors. Her
hostess Avas Miss Kemp—the lady who has
turned out some solid books concerning her
wanderings in the East. Justine had a
slice of Yorkshire pudding, besides, under
the roof of Mrs. Claude Roe, an'Australian
Avhose husband is at the usual address in
Gallipoli.
The Benevolent Society’s appeal for help
this Christmas is voiced in its pamphlet.
“Yule Tide.” This granny of N. S. Wales
charitable institutions is 103 years old, and
has found out quite a lot of good ways of
spending money.
“The Govenor gave a lunching yester-
day,” the Telegraph tells us. It must be
the D.T. that always talks of the Blue
Mountings.
A daughter of “Jim” Gannon, K.C., has
just given a Waverley man, Ilarrie Dvcav.
the right to call round in the evenings
Avithout making excuses.
Artist Ruby Winekler, now in Boston
(U.S.), has just turned the corner after
bolting away from appendicitis. The Sydney
girl’s gossamer illustrations have caught the
fancy of W. Wilson’s subjects. She is
steadily climbing the ladder that leads to
dollars.
Mrs. Pain, Avife of the Gippsland bishon.
has come back to look at her lambs. Before
leaving Sydney Parson Pain used to hand
out the text in St. John’s, Darlinghurst.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November 8, 1935.
Mv Dear Yarrje.—
This C.up may have been a success as a
mere race meeting, but socially it was rag-
tag. First of all there was no vice-regal
circus; the Fergusons just rolled along to
the terrace steps in a limousine and made a
quiet, plain-clothes entry. Seen in the
official pen bereft of her carriage furs, her
Fx. was dressed in a soft smother of grey,
with puffy white tulle and lace about the
bodice and big grey feathers in her hat.
Governor Barron, of Westralia, yawned
with them. He wore an eyeglass and a
grey suit. The Pudukotas were close by.
The Also Ran-ee looked weary. Her very
fair hair was groomed smoothly back under
a shady hat, and she wore a dress made of
a curious Indian silk, with gold flowers
woven into its soft grey folds. Her other
things were already packed and down at the
mail-boat bound for India. The skipper and
most of the passengers saw the Cup run and
then fled for the wharf on the stroke of six.
Governor Stanley, in a comfortable grey
crush lounge-suit, vice-regaled away the
hours in the birdcage with his trusty Gent-
help at his elbow.
Mrs. Patrobas Widdis was in neat navy
tailorings with a dream of a hat made up of
buff and white and blue. The Widdises
refused to drink the noble brute’s health in
champagne, but sent the wine to the hos-
pitals. Russell Clarke and his missus (she
used to be Miss Mackenzie of Tasmania)
were there. She sported a particularly mag-
nificent series of furs, which reached from
chin to boot-tips. They were off some flossy
brown animal which had no further pse for
them. Roma Clarke, having exhausted the
possibilities of ordinary clothes, put in a
bid for publicity in a hideous yellow and
black suit which terminated not far below
her knees. A sister attracted some notice
with a tiny parasol tip-tilted at one side
like a broad-brimmed hat. One woman,
evidently a Best Dresser, walked with her
head in a filmy blue-bag; the veil disguised
her effectively. She incautiously sat down
on the terrace wall and her knee-short navy
silk skirts looked like a ballet dancer’s tulle
frill. Mrs. Leslie Stuart had a pale blue
stripe in her neat khaki suit and balanced
her duck of a hat on her nose like a juggler.
Hocking, from Westralia, was here and
there. He has been buying new horses,
and threw up his hat when one of them
won the Cup Steeplechase. The Manifolds,
from Camperdown, were in force as usual.
The womenfolk, being representatives of a
racing district, stuck to sensible tailor-
mades.
One Gippsland farmer-lady had a small
and early bet on Patrobas for the Cup.
When the colt passed the post ahead of the
mob, she gasped “Oh! I’ve won £140!” and
straightway fainted all over the crowd. Poor
creatures that we are, our racing minds are
so used to working on a half-crown basis
that a shower of gold stuns us ! If I ever
won more than 7s. Gd. in one lump I would
have to knock the G.-G.’s grey belltopper off
his head or die.
Mrs. Widdis, owner of Patrobas, is the
only woman who has ever gained immor-
tality with a Cup winner. And she and
Mrs. Alawa Buchanan are the only two who
have owned a Derby winner.
Federal Government House was a quiet
place this Cup-time. There was no free
entertainment for anybody beyond a heavy
dinner or two for mandarins of the first
grade. As soon as the Cup was emptied,
alt the Excellencies rushed away from the
big, grey house as if some evil soul had put
ferrets into it.
During the Flemington horse scramble, a
big grey Wolseley motor Avas run out on to the
promenade lawn. It was a raffle car donated
to the Australian Red Cross by Mr. Gar-
land, of the Dunlop Tyre Co. The climax
of the gamble is timed for November 26, and
the tickets are fi\ T e shillings each. Do you
want one?
The second patriotic dinner, eaten at the
Savoy on the Wednesday night after the
Cup, folloAved the first too closely to be a
big success. The Best Fed still‘had their
appetites; but they had been engaged far
ahead for the horse season. The Bowes
Kellys, Widgiewa Falkiners, George Fair-
bairns and Barlows AA'ere hosting. Elderly
lawyer Bowman, from Sydney, Avas at a
party given to his fiancee, Miss Rhodes.
Swedish Consul Aon Goes ran another groan-
ing board. Eventually the proceedings
became frivolous; the tables were shoved
aside and dancing began, \vhen the revelry
Avas fairly started a young squatter-visitor,
avlio had been dining quietly upstairs,
waltzed in Avith something particularly chic
in black. The matrons thereupon put up
their glasses and eyebrows and shoulders
and noses, and presently the poor young
things became aware of the change and
drifted out again. The auctioning results
did not stagger or delight the charitable.
But there are promises—or are they threats?
—that the next blow-out will be very care-
fully inflated beforehand.
Ancient history telleth us that Sassiety
got some excitement out of the cafe ehantant
at Raveloe —the Emmertons’ house on South
Yarra hill. It was really a big race-week
frivol circumspectly dressed in Red Cross
disguise. Entrance was by expensive
tickets ; but every care was taken that the
passports fell only into well manicured hands
or perfectly-fitting gloves. It was an even-
ing affair and the clothes were gorgeous.
The Hodges, Grices, Fairbairns and Clarkes
were all “helping” with the raflles and so
forth, and the song programme was just like
one of the old-time expensive At Homes of
Cup week. The Bowes Kellys, Dalrymples
and Fannings were to the fore, and Lady
Helen Ferguson shed a brilliant vice-regal
blessing over all. Mrs. Emmerton and her
daughter, Mrs. Norman Brookes, received
her Ex., who was a vision of grey embroi-
deries and pink roses, and made a stirring
Red Cross speech. Miss McAdam and her
fiancd received congratulations, and there
was some confusion as to which of the
numerous khaki boys had just become en-
gaged and which were brand-new bride-
grooms. Marriages are so hurried and
quiet nowadays that one can’t keep track
of them all without a card system.
Steeplechase Saturday at Flemington
closed the greatest week of the 52. A storm
of rain came just before the big race ; till then
the heavens were supported on a pillar of
dust. It was curious to see every tidy man
whip off his hat at the first patter of rain-
drops and give it 25 lashes with a big hankie
or spank it by hand. Women flew to cover
like barnyard ebooks, the frilly variety hav-
ing a particularly lively time. One smart
young dame who had very short skirts
showed extra-plump calves in tight white
silk stockings as she scuttled for the crowded
stand and flew straight into a thicket of
umbrellas.
Daisy Jerome was very smart in grey
satin, with a grey cloth cape and grey velvet
bonnet. Melba’s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Arm-
strong, was startling because of the size of
her Puritanical cape-collar of white muslin
over black taffetas. Everard Browne was a
symphony in autumn-leaf shades and took
life easily as one of a man-party. Justice
Cussen walked modestly in spite of the
Aveight of the thanks of both Houses which
had been heaped upon him during the week.
This was for re-stuffing the horsehair
sofa of the Law, which was down on its
springs. Lawyer Casey wandered about
looking thoughtful—perhaps because brother
Dick is still in the hands of the surgeons.
The G.-G.’s collection had scattered off to
Sydney and the visitors had gone off to their
various homes, but Stanley and a Man Fri-
day or two managed to get along to see the
end. Mrs. IT. S. K. Ward looked really noble
in all-grey tailorings, and Mrs. Rankin, from
Maoriland. was a vision in soft white, with
a black Gainsborough hat. The lonely
Fenner girl partied with some Rutherglen
friends. She was befrilled from neck to
toe with stiff glacd silk, and was forced to
beat down the fluttering waves as the wind
flung them at her face. The handsome Bail-
lieu girl wore a sleeveless navy suit (there
were short sleeves of net, you know) and a
flat pancake hat with flattened ostrich fea-
thers. _ Mrs. Arthur Richards (who used to
be Miss Rowe) walked the laAvn in the
cutest, dress of frilled Avhite glace. Her hus-
band is at work in India. Mrs. McEvoy
swathed her neck in a black satin choker
and wore plain muslin frills up to her nose;
the rest of her clothes were biscuit-color and
the hat Avas a bleached straw bird’s nest.
Adelaide’s despatches:—
The Medina smoked over the horizon with long
decks dotted with neighbors. W. J. Isbister, a
Avell-known barrister, is bound for Red Cross work
in Egypt; Mrs. Edgar Brown follows her doetor-
husband, who has already gone per transport to
No. 1 Base Hospital; Mrs. Carew Reynell, widow
of the late Lieut.-Colonel Reynell, is going as far
as Egypt; Mrs. Longbottom and her daughters are
bound for somewhere else; and Mrs. Humphrey
Makin will probably fetch up in Egypt, where her
husband went. Meanwhile the sea has given back
to us the Guy Makins and R. W. ITa'ckett. The
latter put in a dreary time in a German internment
camp. Another arrival is Mrs. Wright, widow of
the late Captain Wright, who was killed in France
in the early days of the war. He aviis A.D.C. here
in the Bosanquets’ time. She is on a visit to her
people, the T. E. Barr Smiths.
Two more old Prince Alfred College boys—T. E.
Cleland and R. S. Davey-—have got commissions in
England. Archdeacon Samwell’s only son is on his
way to shell-fire from Sydney.
Lieut.-Colonel’s Miell’s estate has been sworn at
about £23,000. It goes to his vndow and children.
The financial “feeders” for the forthcoming Gov-
ernment House fete are now bidding for cash. One
of the tributary shows is a small exhibition of the
pictures that are to furnish the art section of the
Australian stall. Lady Galway looked in during the
afternoon, and a good many of the canvases were
sold.
The engagement is proclaimed of William, the
third of the William Gilbert sons, of Pewsey Vale,
to Pauline, the younger of the T. L. Brownes’ daugh-
ters. Last week Margaret Hughes, a cousin of the
leading lady, wedded Roy, the eldest of the \V. L.
Davidsons’ sons.
From England comes news of the marriage of Mrs.
Cordon Ayers to Mr. E. Boddam-Wetham. She was
one of Adelaide's smartest and best-looking young
women, and he was here on the Challenger some
time back, lie is a brother of a one-time A.D.C.
to this State's Government House. Another peaceful
engagement is that of Harold, one of the H. B.
Hugheses, of Atlielney, to E. Margaret, the second
daughter of the late E. C. Gwynne, of Payneham.
The “Hut,” built by the Cheer-Up Society for the
use of soldiers, was given its final coat of paint and
its last polish during the week, and then declared
ready for use by the Governor.
Allan Morey, who has annexed a Military’ Cross
for gallantry at Loos, went to England as a Rhodes
Scholar not long before the present turmoil com-
menced. He volunteered to cross open spaces
between the lines to get information, and went some
distance after being wounded to report to his com-
manding-officer.
Mrs. John Downer has booked her passage, and
that of her small son, for Egypt. She will stay
there awhile and then go on to England, but she
talks of returning to S.A. within a year.
The Way Campbells, who have the travel habit,
are off again to England. That will be once out
and once back since the war commenced.
Mabel Marryat and Joan O’Halloran Giles have
come back from England and Scotland and the
Seven Seas, including the Spanish Main.
God Save the King!
Family-solicitor Edward Rigby is this
week being installed as one of the eight lay
canons of St. Paul’s Cathedral. It is a rare
office —a sort of spiritual V.C. —and is the
subject of a certain amount of dignified com-
petition when death removes one of the elect.
Dolly Castles is leaving for the land of
the star-spangled dove at the end of the
month, and is spending her last weeks in
Melbourne in a private hospital, after a
slight operation. She is, however, progress-
ing favorably and declines to be down-
hearted.
Mrs. Brookes, who used to be Ivy Deakin,
has gone off to Egypt to join husband ll> v
bert. lie is one of Adrian .Knox’s helpers
in straightening out the Red .Cross tangle.
Louise Mack made a bolt through Mel-
bourne to Sydney and a rest, but not before-
she had been one of a party to plant wattle
trees at the Base Hospital and attended
a luncheon party with a strong Parlia-
mentary flavor which was given in her
honor. Andrew Fisher and the Pearce pair
attended, and the party afterwards went
along and listened in the newly-arranged
House while Fislier was congratulated on
giving himself a new job.
Young Dr. Frank Keane, who used to
heal Glenferrie, went to France at the begin-
ning of this gunpowdery year, and was a
minor in No. 5 General Hospital to starl
with. Now he has been hoisted to the posi
of Assistant Surgical Specialist at No. 1
Hospital, Rouen. He had a bout of illness
on his own account some time ago, but won
it on points.
Ex-Gaud Mayor Henry Weedon’s younger
brother, W.J., who lately enlisted in the
A.1.F., left the other day for the Front as
a private.
The Frederick Blackwood lordliug, who
left Melbourne at the first jump for the war.
has been invalided to England from the
fighting ditches in France. He is Major
Blackwood now; in the Boer War, in which
he won a D. 5.0., he was a lieutenant in the
Lancers.
Pretty Dollie Parker, daughter of the ex-
judicial Parker, of Westralia, remained at
home when the family moved east. Now
comes the news that she has accepted young
Alec Macleod, who is one of the irresistible
wounded heroes.
Mrs. Ted Mitchell has hurried off to Eng-
land to comfort the eldest girl, whose hus-
band has a naval job. A younger daughter
goes with mother; the other remains to see
that the K.C. gets his breakfast on time.
A cable from Frank Carse saying that he
had been invalided to Egypt sent his little
wife off at top speed in the Medina.
Our warriors in England are as prompt
at the altar rails as they are in the trench.
Aviator Foster Rutledge has been to church
with Mildred Manifold, daughter of the
Willie Manifolds, of Purrumbete, Camper-
down, and popular Freda Shaw, another
member of the squattocracy, lias said “Yes”
to Ronald Pyman, a likeable English youth
who was connected with the oil industry
before he went to war.
The latest arrivals from Germany are
Elliel Liggins, the Sydney singer, and Mar-
garet Edson. the pianist. They were domi-
ciled in a Berlin pension when the lid blew
off Europe, but sat tight and said nothing-
till the first burst was over. About the
time the Germans were digging themselves
in on the Marne they packed their grips and
slipped over to England. Unluckily they
had to leave behind them a piano and a
varied assortment of luggage. You can’t fly
with a piano.
Colonel Tivey’s wife, who belongs to the
house of Robb —Malvern wing—has started
a little association, composed of wives,
mothers and other interested relatives of
her husband’s fellow-officers. The amiable
objects of the new association are (1) tea
drinking; (2) keeping one another’s spirits
up; (8) looking after the interests of every
soldier in the brigade (Btli Inf.) while he is
away. If the thing is done with thorough-
ness and tact it should help quite a lot.
Henry Barnet, of the St. Kilda Council,
and probably the most effective parks-gar-
dener about Melbourne, led a deputation up
to Mayor Hewison the other day. kowtowed
three times and asked that the Y.M.C.A.
might be allowed to build a rest-house for
soldiers on the St. Kilda foreshore, with
enough room to grow a few sweet peas on
the sunny side. The Mayor’s reply, con-
cealed in polite phrases, was understood to
be favorable; and now .Tews and Gentiles,
the local Patriotic Committee, the Shrimpers’
Association and the rest are working to give
the Christians their hearts’ desire. The
rest-house is to be a neat, commodious shaek
ac the back of the Palais du Danse, with a
free lawn and sea-breeze available for every
soldier.
The women of the Overseas Club, who
want a shipload of vegetables for our legion-
aries in the trenches, gave a c-afe chantant
last Friday night in the Club rooms. There
was every known contrivance for getting
money out of the public ; but what is wanted
is something like a milk-shake machine
which will seize and rattle the visitors till
all their money falls out of their clothes.
It cost only lialf-a-crown to get in to the
bushranging. Some of the preserved vege-
tables and fruits were on view and made my
mouth water. The Club cleverly coaxed
Professor Osborne down from the University
and got him to explain the high food values
of vegetables and fruit. The flock of even-
ing-dressers looked quite intelligent for a
while; but they soon tired of hearing about
the gastric juice and began to yawn
politely. Mrs. Jansen attended to the music
and Mrs. Barlow ran a cigar stall. Miss
George peddled flowers and sweets, and
a platoon of girls sold programmes indoors
and outside in Fiinders-street. Mrs. Secre-
tary James, a gracious figure in lilac, told
everybody just what the Club was doing
with the bottled vegetables. Mrs. Dyer
came along in the good cause of cabbage
with a sunburst of gold embroidery on her
black dress. Mrs. Eggleston, wife of the
lawyer, sat in a bead cloak, and Mrs. God-
frey and her daughters were on hand in
clothes which defied the Finger of Scorn.
Mrs. Senator Pearce in soft dove-grey duds
was with daughter Dorothy, and her man-
o’-war came along later with Andrew Fisher.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

When it comes to Men’s Shirts we have found
it a wise policy to make a speciality of a
necessity for men upon which efforts have
been concentrated to give the best value
from every standpoint, and this applies to
the POPULAR
“DOUBLE-LIFE” SHIRT
It is all that the name implies. The special
features, as illustrated, ensure practically
double wear, which means double value for
the remarkably low price as quoted.
These shirts are cut and made by experts

THE UMPIRE.
FOOTBALLER (suddenly hearing the familiar
sound of a whistle): “Ah, gum! Wot
for? I never touched ’im!”
“Itan”: Perhaps the greatest resort for
wild fowl in Queensland is Lake Buchanan, 40 miles
from Aramac. Not far away is Lake Dunn, also a
great bird resort. Buchanan, during a wet season,
is 20 miles in circumference. Birds frequent these
places in the breeding season in millions —ducks,
geese, swans and others. Lake Dunn, even when
brimming, is so full of bird life that the water is
useless for stock. Buchanan is uecter in that
respect, as the water is deeper. In the nesting season
the eggs lay around in millions, but as small settlers
are beginning to spread out into those parts, most
likely they will interfere with the sanctuary. If
possible, some means should be adopted to conserve
the birds, too few now in Australia.
“Tibs”: He has been passed out already
four times on the same charge, but is still game.
“ ’Lllo, woo-woo-woo-where you going?” “I’m going
to enlist, Bill.” “Wa-wa-wa-wait a bub-bub-bub-bub-
bit an’ I’ll cuc-euc-euc-cuc-eome tut-tut-tut-too.”
“But, Bill, they’ll onlj r pass you out again.” “Wa-
wa-wa-wa-why ? Dud-dud-dud-dud-damitall, d’they
th-tli-think I wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-want ter tut-tut-tut-
tut-talk the bub-bub-bub-bub-blasted tut-tut-tut-tut-
Turks ter dud-dud-dud-dud-death ?”
“Overlander”: I have seen no mention of
the supple-jack or vine tree, which is the best and
most even heat-giver on the high Downs, where fuel
is scarce. Next to it in value are the knubblv roots
of tlie currant-bush, more prized because found where
no other fuel is available —out near Connolly’s Water-
hole and Bessie’s Bush, on the track between Camoo-
weal and Anthony’s, where, failing it, one has to
fall back on the last resource of the cattle-man, viz.,
“buffalo chips.” The drawback to a damper cooked
with these is similar to that baked on dogwood of
New England. They flavor the batch. On the coast
the roots of the mangrove are No. 1 for an even
heat. The red rnulga is good in the “corner” about
Clondilla Downs. Absolutely the worst timber to
light in Australia to my knowledge is the peppermint
of New England. You can always light a fire in
stringy-bark country even when it is raining. Strip
a sheet for shelter, use the middle dry bark for
kindling, and you will soon have hot tea, which is
the compensation for wet saddles when the cattle are
moving.
* * * *
“Mulga” : The monkey-vine mentioned by
lick (B. 14/10/15) probably has no superior as
a bush reservoir; but, unfortunately, it is indigenous
only in coastal areas. In Central and Western Queens-
land, however, there are two trees from which bush-
men can replenish their waterbags in drought time. One
is the bottle-tree, which needs only cutting into a
few inches and a bountiful supply is obtainable. The
other is the kurrajong, the surface roots of which, if
cut into short lengths and hung up over a receptacle,
will trickle out a good helping. Like the liquid
from the vine the fluid has a resinous or gummy
taste, but it is a welcome thirst-quencher when there
is nothing else going.
* * » *
“V.”: Vanilla-growers in Tahiti suffer a
sc\ ere disability through the lack of co-operation on
the part of insect life, of which there is practically
none in the island, barring wasps and mosquitoes.
As a consequence the fertilisation of the flowers has
to be done by hand. The male portion of the flower
(I do not know its Sunday name) is shaped like a
tongue and the female like a cup. When the flowers
arrive the tongue has to be cut off and placed in
contact with the feminine part to secure fertilisation,
this operation is a delicate one, and has to be per-
formed on the first day the flower opens, otherwise
it is too late. The native, being a born procrasti-
nator, hates blossoming time for this reason, but he
has to get the job done to pay the interest on the
mortgage, generally held by John Chinaman.
*****
-Le Babarantiko”: According to news
biought from the Gilbert Group, Bob Correy and
family have drifted away into the Pacific, while
sailing in a cutter from Maiana to Tarawa, and are
apparently gone for good. That makes the second
time the patriarch has drifted away from Maiana.
A good many years ago he and another trader were
whisked away in a dory, and eventually
brought up on one of the Marshall atolls
not much the worse for the grisly ex-
perience. The distance from Maiana to
larawa is but 18 miles, yet the crossing
involves considerable risk, owing to the
mighty Equatorial Current which usually
runs to the westward, and there have
been many drift-aways. Usually they
bring up in the western Marshalls, the
Carolines or the outlying islands east of
the Solomons. (A cargo boat which
drifted away, empty, from Ocean Island
brought up on the coast of New Guinea.)
Many perish on that stretch of from 240
to 1000 miles of ocean. The most re-
markable case during my residence in
the Gilbert Group was that of the late
AVilson, trading on Nonouti. Just to
show everybody, he, with a native crew,
sailed out of Nonouti Lagoon bound for
the-few-miles-distant Tabeteuea Atoll.
Outside the lagoon they were becalmed,
and the craft promptly drifted away.
Days dragged by, and when they were on
their last cocoanut they sighted Baker
Island, a worked-out guano dot, 600 miles
due east from Nonouti, but were unable
to reach it for the current. Here the miracle hap-
pened. Burdett-Coutts’ yacht, the Laurel, happened
along, took the famished men on board, and towed
the boat back to Nonouti.

“S. S. Severn”: Nearly every Papuan vil-
lage has its albino, blue-eyed most of them, with
rose-pink skins and garish yellow curls. The gild-
ing is too acute; it has the aura of poison weed.
The freaks appear to be throwbacks to some long-
since white strain. In Motu-Motu, a very huge
Tauripi folk village, I saw a beautiful child, with
agate-hued eyes and golden hair that rippled to her
knees, sitting under a palm-tree with her whole
soul engrossed in hanging a garland of frangi-
pani flowers about the neck of a village pig. The
Samoan missionary when questioned about the girl
shrugged his fat shoulders, and said: “Proper
native; no can white.” Which, interpreted, meant,
though the skin was white, no peroxide on earth
could bleach the personality.
INDIGESTION; OR THE BITER BIT.
C ADGER: “Gimme a tray, boss, I ain't 'ad a feed fer a week."
BADGER (a martyr to indigestion): “Lucky devil.”
“D.F.”: A white seal came ashore at
Burnie (Tas.) the other morning. For a day or two
it disported itself quite happily about the mouth of
the creek at South Burnie, and then some destruc-
tive idiot knocked it on the head, alleging as an
excuse that he thought it was going to bite him.
I wish it had bitten him to death. There are
millions of fools around, but white seals are rare.
* * * *
“W.G.8.”: Re the common belief that
alligators use the claws or feet for grabbing their
victims. I have seen three horses that have been
attacked by the devils, and none of them had been
touched with the claws, but all showed marks of the
teeth. One know-all insisted that claws had torn one
of the horses on the head till the vet. pulled out half
an alligator tooth that had broken off. Even when
feeding the reptiles do not use their claws to tear
the victuals.
* * * #
“Paroo Joe”: Not the kurrajong but the
mulga is the champion cattle fodder-tree of Aus-
tralia. The far west of N.S.W. has just emerged
from one of the severest droughts on record, yet
a recent consignment of six-year-old bullocks, from
Darling River country, realised thirty pounds per
head at Homebush. The Sydney agents stated that
the cattle were fed upon hay, but I’m game to bet
my new swag-strap that they were not. Further,
I’ll bet they had not seen grass for three years, but
were fattened exclusively upon mulga.

“Nick Bottom”: “D.D.” (B. 14/10/’l5)
runs breathlessly looking for a youngster who can
beat his kid’s record of 18 cows milked in an hour
and a half, tie’ll find him waiting at Piccabeen, on

cows in 60 minutes.

“Werrimea”: Quirindi (N.S.W.) Gazette
(8/10/’l5) offers an explanation as to the great
disparity between shearers’ tucker bills this year.
“In our own district this season the mess accounts
have varied from as low as 16s. to as high as 305.,
which is somewhat remarkable. But the men have
only got themselves to blame. When they get a
quid a head for voting for a cook if he gets the
job, they must know that he will fleece them for it
afterwards. And there are several easy ways of doing
it, too—spiriting away the stuff that comes from
the store and charging up stuff that never comes at
all being the most common dodges. In the latter
case, of course, the cook and the storekeeper are in
the game, and cookie generally winds up with a
watch and chain or a spanking new suit.” This is
the first time I have heard of a shearers’ cook buying
votes. As he gets from Is. to 6s. per man per week,
he would require a long-running shed to make it pay.
Of course, he would buy only doubtful votes, but
even a week’s pay out of a month-shed is a lot—
unless a pushing storekeeper helped him. Then the
shearer’s tucker bill would be swollen by more than
he got for his vote.
“Con Lea”: Allow me to inform “Sas-
safras” (B. 2/9/’l5) that on the upper Tweed River
districts I have heard the lyre mimic the scrub-
turkey frequently ; in fact it seems to be the prin-
cipal part of his performance. I have even run
across the “wappett” (turkey) in close proximity to
a mimic, no doubt under the impression that a
cobber was about. But “Sassafras” is quite correct
when he says the lyre does not imitate the wonga.
I’ll add that I've never known him to imitate any
of the pigeon species. Why, 1 don't know. And old
"hands can't give me any satisfaction.

“Pardon 1 ' : A fine Christmas present for
Ours at Gallipoli passed through Bourke from Kil-

12-horse waggon-load of sheepskins, and half of it
was to go to Billjim in the form of waistcoats.
Officer Bros, are the people who thus earn Billjiin’s
-thanks. Fine, brainy chaps, these Officers, by the
way—always at something you wouldn’t expect
mulga sheep-growers to do: painting pictures, or

BAR-BIN’ DOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the big machine’s been busy the best part of
a week
And punched a dozen “twentv-foots” around the jut-
ting peak ;
When Powder Monkey Murphy has ’em loaded and in
trim
(An old hand at the game is he —we call him “Care-
ful Jim”),
Along the wires the eager spark upon its mission
goes
To rouse the latent demons to mad, mountain-rending
throes.
And when the row is over and cleared the dust and
din
Of several hundred falling tons—well, that’s when
ice come in !
It's treach’rous sort of country, among these tumbled
rocks—•
Last year a hundred tons came down and crushed
poor Davie Knox.
So ere the men may start below a gang of us must
work
Along the “face” to clear the spots where hidden
dangers lurk.
And this our occupation—it's one of small renown—
To make things safe and tidy. They call it “Darrin’
Down.”
With bar in hand adown the ropes we take our
careful wSy
To where the loosened boulders hang; our mates
above must pay
The ropes by niggard inches out as we may make
demand,
While scratching footholds in the “face” whereon to
take our stand.
Perched like the chamois on a ledge, a careless
glance we throw
To where the grim rocks wait for us a hundred feet
below.
With judgment sure, and practised hand, we prize
the lurkers loose
And send them roaring to the place where they may
be of use;
And if there’s any breeze at all the boulders as they
fly
Start up a cloud of gritty dust that hits us in the
eye.
But blinded eyes or slipping feet must not to fear
excite,
For we’ve to keep our wits awake, stay cool, and
hang on tight.
Though we’re not strong on souls to save, still we
allow ’tis true
Fa eh has a precious carcase that’s of use to me or
you.
We toil until below it’s safe as in a street in town —
And then we’ve well and truly done our job of
barrin’ down.

“Billy T.”: Breaking the news is really
a fine art. Two years ago Richard had started taking
gloomy views of life. At 28 lie agreed with the
ancient who found that existence was vanity and
vexation. Dick talked little, and when he did talk
his favorite theme was the relative merits of various
methods of shuffling off or “snuffing it.” The gun,
tne rope, the river or the poison bowl —which?
Dick’s relatives said: "Ah. gain, you’re all right.
Dick! Dick decided on the rope. Tom Harvey
found him hanging in the barn. The rope method
had proved most effectual. Tom Harvey called Holt
and Cameron and Dick’s brother Ernest. Holt
climbed up to the rafters with a tommy-axe to cut
Dick down. He was a little too precipitate, and
Dick fell on Ernie. Ernie took this in very bad part.
He lay quite still. It was necessary to carry both
or them home, and Holt was sent on ahead to break
the news to Dick’s mother. Holt arrived all out
of breath. “Please, missus, somethin’s ’appened," he
said. “Ernie's hurted.” "What is it!” cried the
stricken woman. “Tell me! Tell me!” “I dumo,
missus. On'y a few broken ribs, I think. They’re
bringin him up.” Holt went away, but turned back
from the gate, and put his head in at the kitchen
door again. “This is how if 'appened, missus.” he
said. "When we was ontiin' Dick down he fell on
Ernie.”
Following its trout-fry distributions,
A.S.W. Fisheries Department has been transplant-
ing fresh-water lobsters. Several crustaceans were
lifted front one part of the Alurrnmbidgee at Bin-
gagee and liberated in the Uinaralla, which begins
its ramblings near the junction of the Monaro and
Couroek ranges. Another batch began its new life
in the Nepean at Penrith. The ’Bidgee is a fine
stream to produce fresh-water Fa ( men. The
I maralla, Molonglo, Queanbeyan and Yass rivers
trickle in on the right bank, and the Naas Creek,
Cotter, Goodradigbee and Tumut dribble from the
left; and in-all of these there is abundance of feed.

“Pick”: The speed at which a fence can
be run up (It. 14/10/To) depends entirely upon
(1) kind of fence, (2) depth of post-holes, (3) nature
of the sinking. In soft, sandy country, where a
toncer can shovel out a post-hole in 3-1 digs, such a
line of posts as “Mnlga” quotes for the champion-
ship might be erected between jackass and mopoke.
1 have, in fact, heard of cove (though 1 never
met him) who fenced so far in a clay that it took
him three days to walk back to his coat. With
post-and-rail fences, however, and in hard country,
the going is different, and as a performance that
calls for bettering, i want to mention 176 panels of
two-railed fence put up during half a round-about
of the planet, at Rose Vale, near Bungonia (N.S.W.),
by old Amby Carter and young Amby his son. The
latter did the digging and ramming, whilst dad
adzed and fitted the rails, and the yakker was for
a man who stood no slumming.

“Hamer”; The rabbit has been carrying
out a vigorous offensive in the north-eastern regions
of N. S. W ales, where a few years ago it was practi-
cally unknown, and the stock inspector has warned
the coastal districts that the country is becoming
slowly but surely infested, One of the indications
of the advance of the rabbit is the retreat of the
hare, which invariably disappears when the swarm-
ing relative comes down on the fold. The country
along the Northern line was well-stocked with hares
some time back, but you need a 2-h.p. telescope to
see signs of them now.
THE BETTER WAY.
THE MOTHER: "Bitch feeling, such expres-
sion—I shall certainly send her abroad !”
THE CRITIC: " Quite unnecessary, dear lady,
I assure you. Bell the piano."
“Moana”: Maoriland says that recently
when 10 of its men dug 572 post-holes in 3,1 hours, a
record was established. The necessity behind the effort
was the getting ready of the course at Cambridge
(M.L.) for a race meeting. One of the workers was
over 60, but he succeeded in outing everyone but
the gun, who beat him by a couple of holes.
PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCES.
JACK: "When Fin down at Ryan’s pub I can see a hundred Hanky ways er mukin'
money.”
J IM: "Same as me! An new' in or min’ I can see a hundred an’ fiffy blanky ways er

I’.C.’ : \\ ill some horse-doctor pass

“Milo”: In most things connected with
ihe Burke and Wills expedition, Burke’s journal was
noi clear, but his records leave little room to
doubt that the expedition did reach the Gulf. One
of the entries refers to some of the party catching-
sig-ht of its waters. Within the last four
years ample evidence has been obtained to
establish that the expedition accomplished
what it set out to do. The track from Nor-
manton to Burketown crosses the Little
Hynol, about a mile and a half inland from
the limit of the tidal waters of the Gulf. It
forms part of the delta of the flinders, and
beside this stream, close to the limit of the
tide movement, a coolibali tree grows. Some
time ago the manager of Magoura station,
-Mr. Graham, noticed on this tree what looked
like an old surveyor’s mark. It was over-
grown with a thick growth of new wood,
which Mr. Graham removed; and under-
neath he found the letters “B. & AAL, 1861.”
I’hc work appeared to have been done with
a crude instrument, but the letters are
plain. The thickness of new growth indi-
cates that it was very many years since the
initials were cut, and such a growth could
not have developed had the marks been made
since this part of the Gulf Country was
settled. On another tree Mr. Graham found
traces of initials, which are believed to be
those of a subsequent explorer who had
been searching for flic lost expedition. I
have been unable to ascertain what these
initials arc, but the date is 1862. Another
tree, which grows some distance from the
Duchess, in Western Queensland, also bears
the letters “B. & AAV’ These were probably
t u;i de by the explorers, because the party’s journal
indicates that they travelled through this country.

“Romney”: My troubles about the breed-
ing of eels. Here's the way to cook them. Skin
in the usual way, until the abdominal cavity is laid
bare. Remove contents, and replace with a mixture
of butter, breadcrumbs, anchovy paste, pepper,
thyme and parsley or onions. Also smear the body
with these, minus the breadcrumbs. Replace the
skin, and hang deceased beak upwards in front of a
fire, giving the string an occasional twist; or place
him on his back among the embers. Cooked that
way an eel is a feast for a. king, or even a book-
maker.

“S.T.S.": Wha.t does “ging" mean? Or
what did it mean in Sydney in 1801? The new
volume of the Historical Records of Australia shows
that Marshall called Macarthur “a Ging rascal,’' and
was at once challenged to a duel. Henley’s wide-
raking slang-dictionary does not seem to know any-
thing’ of the offensive adjective. As a guess, it may
have been “G—-ing.” The blank might stand either
for some simple word like “grinning,” which
Governor King’s official reporter happened to write
indecipherable, or for some verb he thought too
shocking to write in full.

“Itan”: Re "Pick’s” monkey-vine water

these in Maclean, Clarence River, when the town
was a mere hamlet. It grew in a small scrub. On
several of its branches the moisture exuded in a
lrothy state, and as the small globules
cohered into drops they fell to the ground. I have
been about the bush a good deal, but have never
seen another of the same description. The water
which fell from it was as clear and sweet as drops
from a thunderstorm.

FATHER'S COMPREHENSIVE DRINKINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Poor father drank !” the flapper sighed—
She’d nothing else to say.
The sad and silent caller eyed
The clock that ticked alway.
“Yes,” said the maiden thin of shank,
“I thought you lcneio that father drank!”
“Oh, no!” he groaned, “I never knew!”
She squeaked a faint “Go on!”
And from its dusty cupboard drew
i The fam’ly skeleton ;
Then made the darned thing reel and leap
To keep her visitor from sleep,
if
He listened helpless to her tale,
And licked unmoistened lips ;
His poor tongue tasted dry and stale....
And father had had whips!
Thirsting and coated in the hall —
“Well, good night! Did he drink it allt”
N.S.W.
THE DECANTER.
From the Office Curate: —
A curious side-issue of the war has been the con-
troversy which has raged in the Cold Country as to
the appearance of angels at Mons. Briefly, the story
is that when the British troops were retreating-
before the German cavalry in August, 1914, and
when it appeared as though they would be cut to
pieces, a- squadron of angels materialised out of the
air, and, frightening the Germans’ horses in the best
Old Testament manner, drove the Huns back. No
one seems to know who first started the yarn, but it
spread like a bush-fire and found its way into the
press all over Britain. In no instance was it told
by an eye-witness, but was always given at second-
hand as “the story of a wounded officer (unnamed)
to Miss M., daughter of the well-known Canon M.,”
or something equally vague.
Still, thei-e was an uneasy feeling in pious circles
that it would be just as well to produce one eye-
witness, at any rate, to confound the sceptics ; and
the demand found the man. Private Robert Cleaver,
of the first battalion Cheshire Regiment, invalided
home from the Front, modestly admitted in his
Flintshire village that he had seen the angels;
anyone could, and many did, hear his first-hand testi-
mony in the local pub. When the gossip reached
the ears of the Squire, who is a J.P. and a church-
warden, he sent for Cleaver and got him to make an
affidavit with which to confute the ungodly scoffers.
Cleaver confined his sworn statement to the sentence
“I saw the angels at Mons”; and in the amplifying
remarks which he made to the J.P. under cross-
examination—and which the J.P. at once sent to the
press—he was admirably vague. “Suddenly the
Vision came between them and the German cavalry,
lie described it as ‘a flash.’ I asked him if the
angels were mounted or winged. He could say no
more than that it appeared as ‘a flash.’ ” Even this
vague testimony was greedily seized upon as giving
a knock-out to the sceptics. But someone was base
enough to suggest that the heroic Cleaver had never
been at Mons; and Squire, to refute this calumny,
wrote to the record office of the regiment for par-
ticulars. In return, he got a cold official reply which
proves that Cleaver was only mobilised in Chester
(Eng.) the day before the battle of Mons began,
and did not leave England for France till the day
after the retreat from Mons to the Marne had ended.
But a mere detail , like that won't .discourage the
pious faith of ~the* good ToTks wEcFbelievVthat God
is English—a Cheshire man, maybe—and the tale of
“the angels at Mons” will for generations be told
as a convincing “proof” of the special divine favor
which Field-Marshal French enjoyed.
The veteran James Ashton, father of Will
Ashton, has been re-elected president of the
Society of Arts in S. Aus.. and 11. E. Powell
remains secretary, as he has been any time
these 20 years. At the annual meeting of the
society it was resolved to cut the loss lately
made by having two exhibitions each year.
The ordinary July show is to go in with the
‘'Federal,” in November; but the society
will console itself by showing some
“sketches” in May. There was a brisk debate
on an official proposal to fix a minimum
price of a guinea for a “sketch” and five
guineas for a picture; but eventually this
was thrown out. as being on the lines of
what someone called “Trades Hall Tyranny.”
Incidentally, Will Ashton, whose work has
been bought by many galleries, admitted
having sold things for as little as half a
crown; still, in liis experience, “the bigger
the price the better the chance of a sale.”
“Chug,” in protest:—■
Why this eternal reference to the Germans as
“Huns” ? The Huns were a mob of Asiatics who came
near making a mess of Europe, but the Goths were
a mob of Germans who did make a mess of the
Roman Empire and with the assistance of the Van-
dals, Lombards and a few others put back the clock
of civilisation a thousand years. Why doesn’t the
old name do for the Kaiser’s crowd? Goths they
are, and the name carries as much stigma as any
other. But even that shows a frightful lack of
imagination. Can’t someone invent a plain title
that is less than a thousand years old ?
Well, why not call them Germans? You
couldn’t make it worse.
In the intervals of procuring peace among
the nations, a little coterie in Melbourne
takes its daily peck at a Swanston-street
cafe. There is a penny-in-the-slot electric
piano in the place. It is not a large estab-
lishment, mostly depending on the steady
custom of a few dozen faithful feeders of
all shades of political opinion. At one table
an M.E.A. is accepted as a sort of chairman,
and he discourses in a booming voice on the
war-situation, going back to the days of
Itufus to prove that things could be better
if they weren’t worse, or words to that
effect. Rut the assemblage has its remedy.
“Here, Bill,” says one, reaching down in his
pocket for a copper, “bung this in an’ let’s
get on with our dinner.” Bunged in accord-
ingly. “And so,” says the M.L.A.. “the end
of despotic rule” (crash of melody from
the piano) “downfall of the oppressor
and” (up the scale and down again and
“Rule Britannia!”) “era of peace and
prosperity, with the people no longer bound
to the wheels of” (series of hurried arpeg-
gios, “Sons of the Sea,” more arpeggios, a
salvo of thunderous chords, “God Save the
King”—and half a dozen diners each grop-
ing for another penny).

“8.J.” : The Fog-dweller now has a theatre
in which he or she can smoke—the Comedy,
at which, when the gradual mail left, a
~o, ii o . i • rp,
rmvue, Shell Out was happening. The
ofhcial view is that smoking is only allow-
able at a variety show, and this the Lord
Chamberlain has defined as an entertain-
ment in which there are at least six “turns.”
The Comedy management rushes through
five short items each evening before the
revue starts, and the official conscience pre-
tends it doesn’t know’ its leg is being pulled,
SO to speak.
“Bill o’ Costs”: What a fine old phrase it
is—“the precincts of the court”! It. has
flavor and dignity about it, like dry sherry
and side whiskers. When I read that a
surprised suitor has outside the court room
ventured to express his opinion of the other
party or his lawyer, and has been hauled
back and charged (preferably before Madden,
C.J.) With contempt, then am I filled with
great joy. “Your Honor,” says the out-
raged complainant, “he threatened to pull
my nose within the precincts of the court!”
At the mention of that phrase all the judi-
cial horsehair stands on end, and the rash
person w’ho thought that when once
outside the court he could freelv express
himself, SV .'wfW
description of his offence. Then he learns
that Contempt of Court does not merely
mean offermg cheek .to the beak where he
sits, but includes taking liberties anywhere
“within the precincts,” a vague territory
over which the Judge sometimes steps or the
bailiff spits. Some of these days someone
will raise the point, “What is a precinct?”
Then the old chestnut as to wdiat a “place”
is will be tame and dull by comparison,
because, you see, a, precinct isn’t anywhere,
It is merely adjacent, so to speak; and if
you cannot locate a place, which must be
somewhere, a fortiori, as we say in the law
—but, there, there, what’s the use! Any-
way, I am thinking of hiring someone to go
into the street outside Madden’s Court and
make rudely disparaging remarks about it.
and when my agent lias been lectured for
10 minutes and fined 2s. (id., I shall appeal
to the Supreme Court and the High Court,
and hold a brief in the ensuing arguments,
and my reputation will be established, even
if a precinct remains as nebulous as it was
before.

BRINGS to your home the most refined, pleasing, yet
inexpensive entertainment, entirely at your will.
Merely by a selection of Records it will provide your
friends an entire evening’s entertainment, changing from
vocal to instrumental music, of all kinds, rendering each item
with an astonishing degree of lifelike purity of tone and
distinctness. Or you may enjoy by yourself when tired by
the demands of your business, the most pleasant refreshment
of good music—a beautiful ballad; operatic music by Melba,
Caruso, and all the greatest singers ; orchestral music by the
leading orchestras of the world ; or a comic by the inimitable
Harry Lauder.
THE BEALE KALOPHONE is not an ordinary talking
machine. It is a scientifically constructed musical instrument,
manufactured to designs dictated by a lifelong experience of
the talking machine trade and a full appreciation of the
fundamental limitations of the ordinary “ commercial ”
talking machine. It has not been designed primarily with
an idea of the great volume of tone, but, whilst having ample
power for the largest hall, sufficient to cause the listener
frequently to remark, “ One would believe the singer in this
room,” it possesses an entirely unequalled purity of tone,
free from scratch and brazen foreign sounds. By reason of
its extremely sensitive reproducing mechanism, magnificent
motor and scientifically constructed wooden horn, it is the
first machine which will reproduce any possible musical effect
—a vocal item with the true beauty of the human voice ; a
violin solo with the proper “ woody ” tones of the violin ;
or band music with the bold military challenge of the brass band.

A VEGETABLE THAT REDUCES
FLESH.
“I recently made the astonishing dis-
covery that a vegetable can reduce excessive
fat, arid for the benefit of obesity sufferers
1 give the following facts. About five weeks
ago I met a friend from the south of France,
who. knowing I suffered from obesity, ad-
vised riie to include salith leaves in my diet.
She told me that these were extracted from
a harmless sea plant found off the south
coast of France, and said it was quite well
known among the natives there who main-
tained that it possessed exceptional health-
giving qualities. Though sceptical as to
its success, I decided to give the treatment
a trial, and on inquiry found that my
chemist already kept salith leaves in a con-
centrated and most convenient tablet form.
For the first week I did not notice any
difference, but at the end of the second I felt
undoubtedly better and my clothes (parti-
cularly round the hips) seemed much easier.
Scarcely five weeks have elapsed now, but I
have already lost 91b., and feel ever so much
more healthy and vigorous. I only took two
tablets before each meal.”*

JUST AWAKE AGAIN.
The water supply of the Northern Suburbs of
Sydney has again failed, and in some parts house-
holds have had to depend on water cars. — News item.
RIP VAN WATERBOARD: “Well! Well! Who
would have thought it!”
Part of that benevolent jest, the Nobel
Peace Prize, will this year go to the pur-
chase of cannon, shells and warlike sundries,
for £1125 will be deducted as Swedish defence
tax. Probably it is the first bit of the prize
that ever did anything for peace,-seeing that
purchase of the machinery of war is a surer
way of promoting harmony than the writing
of hundreds of essays to encourage some
people to remain defenceless while others get
ready to walk over them.
The war dwarfs so many things that a
recent peaceful incident of tremendous conse-
quence was scarcely noticed. A man sitting
in an office in America exchanged words with
another man in France —actual spoken words
- —and an operator in Honolulu beard the
talk. It is little tilings like this that ought
to make somebody wonder what public works
are permanent. And the outcome of the
wonderment ought to be a sinking fund every
time.
The acrid protest of N.S.W. Liberals
against the Broken Hill Trades Hall Exten-
sion Bill, which gives the Barrier unions
another slice of land in the middle of the
city, would have sounded a lot more genuine
if it hadn’t been the Liberals who gave the
first slice. That was long ago, when the
two big parties of the time were fishing for
the Labor sprat. Henry Parkes, who helped
the business through, subsequently laid the
foundation-stone of (he ball. That night
somebody overturned it and stole the coins
underneath ; but the old man proved an alibi.
There are some people who can’t learn
the truth. The W.C.T.U. of Victoria has
passed the following resolution at its annual
convention without a dissentient voice:
“That the Union advocate the closing of
liquor bars permanently at six o’clock, in-
stead of temporarily at half-past nine
o’clock, and that ‘shouting’ be made a crim-
inal offence.” The W.C.T.U. produces no
figures to show that the 9.30 early-closing
lias been even a partial success. So far, all
the available figures indicate a rank failure.
As for the suppression of “shouting.”
Australia lias been advised of only one soli-
tary conviction for this offence under the
new English law—which seems to dispose of
the efficacy of that measure. This fooling
around with proven fallacies gets the Union
nowhere —and meantime the liquor trade is
putting new r mirrors in the private bar and
at 0.25 p.m. is doing a roaring traffic in
buttled beer to he drunk on the kerbslitone
in the shweet by-hic-bye.
We are capturing somebody’s trade, any-
how. Imports to Australia for nine months,
January-September:—
1914 .. £58,416,742 | 1915 .. £50,752,724
Exports of products other than gold during
the same periods :
1914 .. £47,080,370 | 1915 .. £41,725,958
Gold exports:—•
1914 .. £1,996,407 | 1915 .. £8,091,926
So, with all the fevered borrowing, it is
clear enough that Australia hasn’t borrowed
hard enough to keep her credits on the right
side, and is now, in addition to importing
foreign capital in the shape of goods, ex-
porting Australian gold at a greater rate
than it is produced from the mines. There
can be only one end to a country which goes
along on those lines; and the depreciation
of the paper currency will mark its arrival
at the half-way house.
A wail went up from Sydney Telegraph
the other day that the Northern Territory
refused to go ahead in spite of “there being
no constitutional restrictions to its complete
development by the most up-to-date Labor
methods.” Its condition certainly is nothing
• for Labor to crow about; but what about
the anti-Labor crowd? . They had control
for 50 years or more, and when the Com-
monwealth arrived in 1901 the result of all
the “development” along anti-Labor lines
was a white population of 4073. And it
wasn’t because the Telegraph’s pet black-
and-tan mixture was prohibited. There was
a time when Chinese over-ran the place. That
was when tlie Telegraph’s nigger policy
went to pieces, for the Chinese didn’t develop
the country worth tuppence: they simply
gouged tlie eyes out of its mining fields, and
then cleared, leaving it every way poorer.
The Telegraph’s crowd simply smudged
tlie page. The Labor crowd, if it hasn’t
done much, has anyhow kept the page clean.
The S. Aus. Assembly lias resumed its
Bible-class manners. Over a discussion on
a Teesdale Smith contract, arranged in a
hurry to give work to unemployed, Public
Works Blundell said: “I publicly admit that
the Government did not do so much as it
might have done. Tlie Government did make
a mistake in not going to the extent of
advertising for offers to have the work
carried out.” On which this lady-like dia-
logue followed:—
Peake: It was a loose business arrangement.
Works Blundell: It was. I have already admitted
that.
Peake: There seems to have been no check.
Works: There was no chance to get a check, in
the circumstances.
Peake: Oh, well, I feel that the iirice paid in that

Tlie Sunday-school certificate which the
Assembly had been imperilling with its

Late Minister for Home Affairs Archibald
in reference to O'Malley, cheerfully remarks
“I have no doubt I shall be a Minister when

fairly personal matter for the Kink.
THE END OF THE SHOW.
GLOOMY ACTOR: “ WHat's the mater this morning, Albert?”
GLOOMIER MANAGER: "Baby Briggs is getting married, and the show's queered."
Said Asquith —•
But I challenge anyone to prove there has boon
anything of sloth, indifference and self-complacency
to face unpalatable facts, or to conceal the truth.
(Cheers.)
A few minutes later, among other charges,
Edward Carson brought this against the
Government: —
So far as he could sec when he was in the Cabinet,
there icas no staff at all.
And a little later on, Charles Beresford told
the world this :
Hitherto there had been no proper plan of cam-
paign. The naval authorities had never been con-
sulted regarding the Dardanelles operations, but
simply told to “do it.”
And still, as far as one can judge, Asquith
the Challenger didn’t turn a hair. What are
these political “challenges” worth?
There was a lot of loose talk in the S. Aus.
Assembly the other night over the rate of
interest which it is permissible for the State
to pay. The Government asked to be
allowed to offer up to 5 per cent, for the
conversion of a loan of two millions just
falling due in London. Peake, the Opposi-
tion leader, offered to allow the Government
to go higher. As a matter of fact, any
rate of interest is merely nominal, unless the
loan is issued at par. In this case the loan
was actually issued for five or seven years
at 99; in other words, you get £99, and pay
£lOO, and on a five-year loan this adds
nearly a quarter per cent, to the nominal
rate of interest. Add underwriting and
various concessions, and the actual rate paid
by S. Aus. is not far short of 5| per cent., in
spite of all the loose Assembly talk above-
mentioned. The quotation of a fictitiously
low rate has the bad effect of making a
borrowing policy agreeable to a lot of people
who would have much more serious doubts
about it if they were told the blunt truth.
From a detached Tasmanian onlooker: —
Our experience so far suggests that the propor-
tional system of representation, with preferential
voting, promotes rather than restricts party strife.
Under the Hare system neither political party in a
fairly equally-divided Parliament need fear a crush-
ing defeat at the polls. There can be no such thing
as a party debacle , so the personal risk to any
sitting member is reduced. Consequently there is
a tendency to ride the party moke recklessly at
all obstacles. Neither the moke nor the rider would
rush the fences if the falling places were not so soft.
A deputation that waited on 1 rank T .
to protest against the 100 per cent, me ‘ 7
of Customs duties on motor-tyres go ,
right answer. Tudor said that lie nite
to do everything he could to prevent '
many from getting busy on Australia a
the war; and tis the local manufacturers,
who had established themselves under the
old tariff and had kept the prices from being
pushed up, could expand, and as crude rub-
ber could he obtained from Papua and the
Northern Territory, lie considered the best
plan to block German trade was to keep tlie
business for Australians. But why doesn’t
Tudor apply the same sensible conclusions
to a few more industries?
A LITTLE GAME OF BOWLS.
Another £11,010,000 was added to the public debt
during last year. The total now amounts to
£127,735,000. — N.S.W. Treasurer’s Budget Speech.
The Sydney city railway was to have been
started before this, but operations have been
suspended until the beginning of next year.
The official explanation is that so many
draughtsmen have enlisted that the Works
Department is unable to prepare the work-
ing plans. Lack of cash —of course not!
The only chance that any N. S. Wales job
has of being held up for lack of cash is the
absence from the earth of any person from
whom the Government could borrow.
MAORILAND SPEAKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here to the courts of tlie Empire I am come. Let
my voice be heard.
Ye have named mine a little people. Hearken to
this my word.
Untilled, alone, unfruitful, a forest of mighty trees,
An unstrung, unpolished jewel in the swirl of the
Polar seas,
They found me, and straightway labored in stress
and travail sore,
Cut and polished me, forged the links binding me to
your shore —
Cut and polished unrestingly, as it was only meet,
That I of the setting he worthy, that your girdle
might he complete.
When the sword leaped from its scabbard, did my
people falter or weep ?
From the North in the sun a-dreaming, through the
Straits where the wild winds leap,
To the Bluff like an icicle gleaming, where the
sullen pole tides creep,
The message rang- and they heeded. In their man-
hood’s strength and pride,
From the North to the South they rallied, and
sprang to the mother’s side.
They are a handful of people on the outer rim of
the earth,
Where the arts of the old world nations are still in
the throes of birth ;
of color, and song, and laughter life lias doled them
a scanty share,
But has filled the day with labor, and dulled the
night with cave.
Yc own a hundred cities ablaze with time’s purple
and gold,
Right it is that your sons should fight for the
wealth and romance ye hold.
My sons fight for tlie Future, holding it ns their
bride,
With courage deep as the ocean; their souls as the
skyline wide.
And when the task is over, with love in their hearts
they will sweep
Over the mighty waters, over the vasty deep,
Back to the mist and the sunshine, to tlie sting- of
tlie icy breeze—
To the emerald they have wrought me agleam in the
Southern seas.
Ye have named mine a narrow people—the fires of
my heart are stirred.
1 have spoken, Mother and Sisters—my far land
awaits your word 1

A NEW INVENTION
The “Rawson Moody”
Patent All-Steel Fence
There are three distinct stages in the evolution of the fence —first
the stone period, second the wood, and third the steel.
The stone fence was too expensive to quarry—too weighty to handle,
hence it soon gave place to wood.
The wood fence has also had its day. There are too many objections
to its use. Being subject to quick decay, it serves as a breeding
place for vermin. It is rigid, and lacks flexibility or springiness.
It is also very susceptible to destruction by fire.
The “RAWSON MOODY” is the last word in fencing—THE PATENT
SELF-LOCKING, ALL-STEEL FENCE.' It is as superior to wood
as an automobile to a buggy—a man-power to a gas-engine.
The remarkable flexibility of the “Rawson Moody” enables it to
stand the severest strains, as the whole fence resists the strain put
upon it at any given point.
The “Rawson Moody” fence has long passed its experimental stage—
being now the most popular and most successful fence made. Used
by landowners all over Australia, and by the New South Wales
Government.
The “Rawson Moody” is a complete fence, comprising straining posts,
standards and droppers—all of which are supplied separately if
required.

A HINT TO THE SWEETHEART.
To the thousands of sensible young
women who have men friends serving in the
ranks at the Front and who desire to send
some article that will he of real _ benefit,
instead of some silly, useless trifle, it might
not be amiss to suggest sending a bottle of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Fills.
A bottle of pills may seem an amusing or
unusual thing to suggest; but, seriously,
could anything of equal size or cost be sent
that will be so necessary or useful? _ It is a
well-known fact that the men require such
a remedy. The irregular life causes the
system to get out of order, and it is this
getting out of order that is responsible for
such an enormous loss from sickness. The
shot and shell of the enemy are only a part
of the danger the soldiers face. To be an
effective soldier good health is far and away
the most important single item.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are too well
known to the public to waste space telling
what they will do. The little amber bottle
in which they are packed will secure them
from all kinds of weather conditions, and
they can be carried by the men on their
person at all times without inconvenience.
10,000 bottles of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills were offered and accepted by the Mili-
tary Authorities during the early months of
the war. From letters received from Egypt
and other advices, the gift of these pills
was highly appreciated, because they met
the everyday requirement and kept them in
perfect condition. See that a bottle of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills is included in any
parcel being sent to a friend at the Front.*
SPORTING
NOTIONS
The moral of the recent Melbourne Cup
race is that the best of the three-year-olds can
always be expected to make bold bids for it if tlio
most kindly-handicapped of their seniors are not
equal to a two-mile journey. Last year the three
placed horses in the Derby-—viz., Oarlita, Aristaeus
and thru—ran in the Cup without a hope of win-
ning’, for some of the light-weighted older nags were
stickers, and the pace was exceptionally fast. Car-
lita, the best of the youngsters, finished ninth. This
year, with Bst, 41b. up, the same mare finished a
good third, two of the Derby placers being in front
of her. From which it is evident that Carlita, not-
withstanding her notable wins in w.f.a. races, is
not a great mpre, but merely a good one. The colts,
Patrobas and AVesteourt, were better at the weights.
Patrobas won by a neck because he was very fortu-
nately circumstanced as compared with the workman-
like looking AA'estcourt, who is quite likely to develop
into a good Tin over long distances. Patrobas drew
the Mo. 1 position next to the rails, whereas AVest-
eourt got No. 24 position, outside of the field, and
had to cover quite a lot more ground than the
other follow before he got near the rails.
Other bits_ of luck for Patrobas were the break-
down of Naxberry (Bst. 41b.) —a carefully-prepared
four-year-old with some credentials as a stayer—and
the accident which disposed of Marculfus (7st. 41b.),
not to mention Mountain Knight and St. Carwyne,
'Oon after the start. Marculfus, like Naxberry, had
been specially-trained for the Cup journey. Lambert,
who had the mount, was as sweet on his chance as
Bracken, who had been previously engaged for it.
Marculfus was expected to get busy when the other
nags were stopping. But lo! something fell in front
of him and brought him down. So the long prepara-
tion was a waste of time. The luck of the game!
The book shows that Derby horses, though they are
usually in good condition and are honest battlers
(not having begun to lose their enthusiasm for
racing), are very uncertain matters of calculation
in the big Spring handicaps. There are the years
when they shine, and the seasons when they are on.
of it. Prince Foote won Melbourne Cup in 190"
because he was a first-class animal with no good
light-weight elders to beat. Alawa, the runner-up to
Prince Foote, was a doubtful stayer with 9s t. 31b.
in the saddle, and Aberdeen, the third horse, was
too infirm to be thoroughly trained. Lord Nolan,
the three-year-old who won in 1908, carried 101 b.
less than a Derby winner’s weight, and had nothing-
much to beat. Poseidon —a great horse up to 12
furlongs, but not a really good stayer—struck a
year when the opposition was weak, and he won
the Cup from the colt (Antonious) that had stretched
his neck in the Derby. The fresh and sprightly
tliree-year-olds had things made easy for them thm
year. It was the same when tlio young stable com-
panions, Clean Sweep (7st.) and Malster (7st. 111 b.).
finished first and second for the Cup, with a com-
moner named .Mix in third place. When Derby
winneF’Merriwee won the Cup in 1899 another three-
year-old, Dewey, finished third; and Dewey had pre-
viously won the Caulfield Cup, a race in which the
less handy Patrobas this year could never get to the
front.
The case of Amberite of yore shows the great dif-
ference between one season and another as regards
the Derby horse’s chances in Melbourne Cun. Amber-
ire in 1897 won both Derbies and the Caulfield Cup.
the same as Poseidon did before adding the Mel-
bourne Cup to liis trophies. But in Amberite’s year
tlie late “Bill” Forrester had his two good things—
Danins (7stl 81b.) and The Grafter (7st. 71b.)—in
the Cup, and they ran clean away from the field.
Gaulus won by a head from The Grafter, who next
year, with 9st. 21b. on liis back, was good enough
io win the two-miles race from AVait-a-Bit, the
Derbv winner. Cocos finishing third. Now, what
chance had am' average top-notch three-year-old of
winning the Melbourne Cup in Gaulus’s year? Not
Buckley’s !
The foregoing remarks go to exnlain why racing
tipsters, without execution, didn’t • greatly fancy
Patrobas for the Cup before he had won the A.R '
Derbv, and why not many of them picked him after-
wards. In the first, place, there was no line of evi-
dence bv which Patrobas could be proved better
than Cetigne and AVesteourt (not to mention the
exalted AVallace Isinglass) before lie bad met them.
And in the next place it was clear that he had a
poor show to beat sueli as Lnvendo and AVillinm the
Silent if they were going to be in better nick
Flemington than they were at Caulfield. Silent
Bill, Reputation and Garlin, who finished in the
first quartette for the Metropolitan, had confirmed
their form by finishing in the first five for Caulfield
Cup, with Lavendo ahead and Patrobas behind
them. The two imported horses and the dandy
black from Maorilahd had only to do as well a
Garlin in the meantime:to be pretty certain to beat
that proved non-stayer in the Melbourne Cup. But
whereas the consistent Garlin repeated himself—
being right in the front rank, and failing onlv i"
the last 100 yards—Lavendo and AA’illiam the Silent
never got near the front. AA'ant of condition for a
two-miles’ struggle might have beaten the infirm
aliens on the pinch, but they never, arrived at the
pinch. Lavendo was badly left at the post, and
couldn’t sustain the effort of making up so much
leeway. AVilliam simply wouldn’t gallop with his
former dash. Circumstances favored fhe Derby colts,
and that’s all about it. Had AVallace Isinglass been
nearly the colt that public fancy painted him—his
owner supplying the paint—-he would have won the
Cup.
Patrobas, being a true son of Wallace,
will take all the hard riding he can get; Hence the
luck of Bobbie Lewis in getting the mount in the
Cup. Smart had ridden a capital race on Patrobas
in the Derby, but he would have had to put up
some extra weight in the two-miles event, and he was
not under contract to ride at catch-weights. Lewis,
for hi.s part, had not been booked for Wallace Isin-
glass, and after the Derby failure he was full up of
that thick-winded deceiver. So he, beHng- the oldest
and strongest jockey who could go to scale at 7st.
61b., was snapped up for the job of pushing Patrobas
in the Cup. Smart couldn’t have done it better.
And the extra weight would have kept Patrobas
from winning.
* * * *
“Bobby” Lewis, who added a little to his
pile by riding the Cup winner, is far and away the
wealthiest of the jockeys now in training. “Bobby”
must be worth more than 25 times his weight in
gold.
*■.***
It was rumored at Flemington ou Cup
Day that William the Silent was strolling around
the birdcage with a muzzle on him, talking loudly
through his nose the while. King Marco, another
imported pony, was mistaken for the better-behaved
William. Marco and Mr. Brennan’s little horse are
much about the same size and color, and with their
legs swathed in bandages either nag might be casu-
ally mistaken for the other.
* * * *
During the Melbourne Cup meeting only
three horses won twice (Patrobas, Marculfus and
Traquette), and only one owner (Mills) entered
more than one winner. The most auspicious trainer was
P. T. Heywood, who was represented by five firsts.
The most successful jockey was Lambert, who rode
them. The winnings list was headed by Mrs.
Widdis, the owner of the Derby and Cup winner,
Patrobas.
* * * *
Mountain Knight earned his oats —over
■£ll,ooo in stake money—before cracking his shoul-
der in the Melbourne Cup; so his wealthy owner,
Watt, of Ilawkes Bay (M.L.), has not much to
complain about. Queer how good luck and bad
comes in patches to men and horses. Mountain
Knight was an exceptionally fortunate horse for
over a couple of years, for though not a first-
flighter he struck seasons when top-notchers were
scarce, and began to look like one. Then. trouble
came in hunks. At the A.J.C. meeting he contracted
some mysterious sickness variously attributed to
dope and to a thistle poisoning his tongue, and
cracked up badly, letting down with a heavy thud
the crowds who. had steadily backed him for Caul-
field. But he brightened up later on, and was
backed some more for the big handicap at Fleming-
ton. It was a hoodoo bet, for Fate, or something,
had him dead lie goes to the stud, with a
good record, lie wasn’t a champion, but he was a
pretty good sort of an ’orse, all the same.
Two brilliant wins by Marculfns in the
Veteran Stakes (12 furlongs) on the Thursday and the
V.R.O. Handicap (14 furlongs) on Saturday must have
convinced the backers of Patrobas that they were
lucky when three horses came to grief in the Cup
race. Marculfns was one that fell, and it now
seems that he only needed a fair run to have got
home in front. Last Saturday the -fine son of
Positano carried his Cup jockey Lambert, plus 221 b.
of dead weight, and galloped the 14 furlongs in
record time for Flemington. On Thursday he had
won the Veteran Stakes in fast time, with Bst. 21b.
up. And he was thrown into the Cup with only
7st. 41b.! On paper Marculfus, the 20 to 1 chance,
was a real good thing for the 16 furlongs’ journey
had Mountain Knight not happened to fall in front
of him.
* * *• *
Carlita, in winning the C. B. Fisher Plate
(12 furlongs) from Cetigne, confirmed the impres-
sion that she should have finished a closer third in
the Cup, though the mare may not have been quite
good enough to win. In the Cup she was giving
Patrobas 121 b. In the C.B.F. Plate, run over the
Derby course, she gave Cetigne 141 b. and beat the
colt by a length. Well, Patrobas beat him more
easily in the Derby.
* * * *■
While the non-success of the Sydneyside
horses was one of the features of the Cup meeting
six out of seven starters for the C. B. Fisher Plate,
on the fourth day, were trained in Sydney, and
they ail finished in front of the one Victorian rep.
As the Plate is a w.f.a. event the fact is the more
surprising. The winner was Carlita, and as she got
away with the Williamstown Cup on Monday, carrying
9st. 41b. at 10 to 1, her stake earnings run into
about £12,500.
¥r V/ * *
“T.F.”: A while ago The Bulletin
mentioned a number of cheap-priced gee-gees which
had won big events. Two more for the list.
Carlita, winner of Williamstown Cup (Vic.), on
Monday, cost only 125 guineas; Bascasse, Queens-
land Derby winner, was exchanged for 100 guineas.
Thus far, the season lias been a triumph for cheap
yearlings—something which will make purchasers
of young blood think heavily.
Steeplechase form is a lot more variable
than the most in-and-out running on the flat. It
is only sometimes that the toughest old ’chasers are
equal to a severe test, though they are kept in
work nearly all the year round. And the average
quality of the jumping fields varies like the fashions
in hats. For instance, last year old Coradjill
‘ lOst. 111 b.) finished last, and a bad last at that,
in the Victoria Steeplechase, won by Swedish Lad
in 6min. 29sec. This year Coradjill, carrying
list. 81b., won the same race in 7sec. better time,
two old stagers that beat him last year being simply
out of it from start to finish this time. In these
races over the big sticks the opponents (or their
jockeys) seem to take turn and turn about. At one
time one lot of gees appear unable to put any pace
on. Three months later they form the vanguard,
and the former lot of leaders run hopelessly in the
rear. A field of 12 for a steeplechase at Fleming*
ton in the “off” season usually means that one of
four horses will surely win unless the whole quartette
topple over. The other eight starters never get near
the leaders.

Thus “Vagabond,” of the K.F.A., settling
down for his second winter at the Flanders Front: —-
The latest sport in Flanders is field-gun sniping,
and you can read that both ways, for the field guns
are the snipers and the sniped. It is a sport really
for g-unner subalterns, although occasionally majors
are tempted to indulge in it when plenty of birds
are about. The Forward Officer of a battery gets up
as near to the German lines as he can. He is armed
with a telescope and a telephone, with a battery tied
to the other end. He keeps a careful and compre-
hensive look-out over the country at the back of the
enemy lines —well back usually, because the front
line is squatting well down in dugouts or under
stout parapets, and doesn’t offer a target worth
heaving a shell at. But back a few thousand yards
the inhabitants are more careless, especially if they
are below the eye-level of the front parapets, and so,
as they fondly imagine, out of sight. Particularly
good sport is to be obtained when a fresh lot of
Huns come up into the trenches, because, not having
learned the ground, they may at any time wander
out on to a patch on which some Forward Officer
has glued his e.ye. Working parties, too, in the
innocence of their hearts, imagining that they may
labor safely without being shot at a mile or two
back, gaily get to work in broad daylight; or a
strange transport driver may take what he thinks is
a short cut. It often is—on a longer journey than
he had expected.
When the Forward Officer spots one of these
pleasant pictures lie makes hurried calculations and
hasty remarks down the telephone to the battery.
Then it's “Fire,” and he claps his telescope to his
eye to view the performance. If he has calculated
angles and ranges and elevations correctly the next
thing the enemy knows is that a disturbance has
been arranged and is due to take place thereabout
within the next few split-fractions of a second. The
game adjourn the meeting hurriedly, and without
waiting for any formality move towards the nearest
cover. If some of thorn have to go away on a
stretcher the Forward Officer enthusiastically shakes
hands with himself and telephones congratulations
to the gun.
One of the best bags he can make or hope to
make is of an opposition Observing Station, with
Forward Officer complete, planted by a battery to
play a hand in the same gun-sniping game. On both
sides a keen watch is kept for any clue to a For-
ward Officer’s hiding-place, and when one is found
a round of high explosive or shrapnel is immedi-
ately unloaded on it. A very young subaltern may
poke his telescope out of his tree and so give the
game away. At times a haystack, which ought to
lie a rigid non-smoker, is observed to be emitting
little blue clouds from its top store}'. Or there may
be a movement in a dilapidated cottage roof which
lias no right to move. There are finer points in the
game; but these are trade secrets in the profession,
and not to be given away.
Occasionally this intelligent sport of gun-sniping
degenerates into a general scrap, when the batteries
on one side, annoyed by some hit scored by the
other, foam at the' mouth and proceed to distribute
eruptions. The other lot hit their hardest back, and
so the scenery bubbles with lyddite and high explo-
sives. During this- period the Fonward Officers, the
genuine gun-snipe sportsmen, keep their heads (etc.)
as best they can, and pray hard that a chance shell
won’t lump in on them. They don’t mind so much
being beaten fair and square at gun-sniping, but
they feel annoyed if they are outed by a blind shot
in a kick-bite-and-scratch. It hurts their profes-
sional dignity (as well as other parts), just as a
boxing world’s champion would be who might get
slugged over the head with a bottle in a rough-
house argument. But, on the whole, gun-sniping
can be recommended as an interesting and exciting
sport, even if an Observing -Station cannot be con-
scientiously recommended as a health-resort.

One of Maoriland’s most noted rifle shots,
Sergeant .Tolm Cox, is on his way to stalk big game
at. Gallipoli. So that- that unholy double, Ha ns-Abdul,
cannot complain of not being warned, this is a
sample of Cox’s form. Last year, at the Auckland
Exhibition: At 800yds., 11 successive bull’s-eyes,
55 points; at 300yds., seven successive bull’s-eyes,
35 points; at 500yds., six bull’s-eyes and an inner,
34 points; at 900yds., nine bull’s-eyes and an inner,
49 points; total, 173 points out of a possible 175.
The year before, also at Auckland, he whanged in
15 consecutive bull’s-eyes from the 500yds. mound.
May. liis bag be full from his present hunting !
A fine family of athletic lads, the Bridges
of Wellington (M.L.), is one short —shot at the
Dardanelles. And that one went out heroically. He
was in a party of Maorilanders who had charged
and been repulsed. After getting safely b
looked out and saw a mate lying wounded ao ,
yards away. Rushing out he hoisted the w ,
man on to his shoulder and struggled lot
Macliine-gtin fire commenced to pour upon •
Bridge’s mate was riddled, and Bridge hun>e •
liis side nearly torn away. They got hint in ■
how and carried him away for the hospital shil,
he knew he was hopeless, and insisted that att '
should be given to those who had a chance,
ever, they put him aboard at last; and a few
later he died.
# * * *
“S.T.S.”: I happened to he there when
old Grace’s great keenness, combined with Ins know -
ledge of the technicalities of cricket, made him '
about the strongest thing within the law ever se.
on a field. He was fielding at point, on Benning-
ton Oval, sometime in 1884, against the Australians.
The ball, bowled to Murdoch, got up awkwardly on
a lump in the pitch, and was put away a few varc s
to leg. The wicket-keeper went after it, a Quick
but safe single was run, and Grace moved up to
the wicket to take the return. The incident seemeo
to be closed. While the wicket-keeper was coming
back to liis place tlie batsman who had to take
strike, Sam Jones, went out to look at the lump and
pat it down; on which Grace put down the-wicket
and appealed for run out. And out it was. Aon see
the ball having been thrown in, and there being no
question of another run, Jones supposed it to >e
dead in the wicket-keeper’s hands; whereas it was
in the hands of Grace, who was not wicket-keeper,
though lie was standing at the wicket. That is,
Grace had not fired on a flag of truce; lie had merely
shot a man who was coming along unarmed under
what he thought was a flag of truce, though technn
cally it was of tlie wrong shade. There was a lot ot
talk about it. The legend at the time was that the
umpire said pointedly: “If you ask me, sir, I must
give it out” ; hut he went into print to deny thaL
saying that lie never made speeches when giving his
decisions. Grace’s own simple, sole and sufficient
argument was that rules are Rules. The man was
out of liis ground, the hall was not really dead, and
his duty to his side required that he should giet a
man out whenever lie lawfully could do so. 1
took the news of the incident to George Palmer, laid
up at the hotel with a sprain. “The old villain, ln-
said. “If I had known lie would do a thing like
that there is a trick I could have played him several
times. He backs up too soon when you are bowling
from liis end. and you could put his wicket down
instead of delivering the ball. Next time I will do
it.” But I never heard of the old man actually
getting out that way.
* * * *
“0.K.”; First-class cricketers are. not
first-class insurance risks. Ilazlitt has gone close
after Victor Trumper, whose old opponent. Grace,
died only a fortnight ago.., Even “W.G.,” who out-
lived so many of liis contemporaries at the game,
was not so very old when he died. Yet: he must
have often felt in his 60’s that ho had missed the
hearse, so to spak. One thinks of the famous
cricketers of 30 years ago, and remembers only
the dead. Murdoch, A. G. Steel, Alfred Lyt-
telton, Bonnor, Shrewsbury, Johnny Briggs, floran
and others have passed out. Of the team that Lord
Sheffield brought to Australia —when the show was
advertised by the name “W. G. Grace” in large caps
on the posters—how many are alive now? The throe
stars—Grace, Stoddnrt and Lohmann —are deceased,
anyhow. Evidently tlie life of a representative
cricketer puts too much strain on the constitution in
most cases. A man can live longer by sticking
strictly to bowls or golf.
Ilccent N. S. Wales enlistments include
three top-notch X.S.AV. oarsmen —Alma Cox, ‘‘Gig”
Smedley and Alf Felton. Cox had a share in all
sorts of Tasmanian sculling championships, includ-
ing six senior eights and two champion eights, and
latterly was a N.S.W. amateur champion. Smedley,
as coxswain, holds the unique record of only losing
one race for Sydney Rowing Club in six years.
Alf Felton is the professional sculler who would have
made a front-ranker if he hadn’t flown too high early
in his rowing life.

Light heavyweights Harold Hardwick and
Harry Reeve battled over 20 rounds at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday, and Reeve got the verdict.
Tt wasn’t much of a scrap. Hardwick outpointed the
Englishman on the first part of the journey, but
made very little use of opportunities for doing
something more emphatic. Towards the end he
tired badly, and Reeve, who is at any rate a stayer,
easily wiped out the score against himself. Hard-.
wick looked like a man who had overtrained. At
any rate, ho shaped poorly, missing often and hitting
without much sting. This suited Reeve very well.
Reeve is plucky and quick-footed,, but that he should
be somewhere near top among the bigger men is a
rather pathetic circumstance.

“S.S.”: I was at a fight the other night.
Ernie v. Arthur. “Fight ’im, Ernie, fight Mm!”
advised a fierce ringsider. Arthur replied in a scorn-
ful aside: “Fight me! Him fight me! He can’t
keep me employed. Somebody get me a bit o’
Knittin’?” This irritated Ernie, and he socked
Arthur on the iaw. When Arthur came to he was
most bitter. “The cow!” he said. “Fancy him
takin’ offence at a little thing like that!”

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the' dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebeco
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth—even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

The society in its present form dates from
1900, when it cut off half its capital to pro-
vide for accumulated and prospective losses
oh properties which had been thrown in.
Tilings turned out a lot better than they
were expected to; and in the past seven
years the society has got back over £10,009
of the money which it then thought it had
lost. This so-called profit has been passed
to reserves. However, there isn’t much more
to come from the same source, as the old
foreclosed properties have nearly alb gone.
This shows the position in that and one or
two other respects :
July,’ol. July,*l4. Jan.,’ls. July,'ls.
Liabilities ..£37,015 £45,813 £40,766 .639,587

Foreclosures .. 72,305 10,576 8,481* 7,912
Cash, etc. .. 2,778 165 990 .1,412
Thus foreclosures have been worked down
from £72,805 to £7912. This money, along
with the accumulated profits, has been put
into advances; but there hasn’t been enough
doing in that way to entice the co. into
borrowing to lend out again. Liabilities
are therefore actually less than they were
14 years ago. Considering the agencies
through which the public can get house-
purchase money nowadays, the society's
earnings are astonishingly good; and (lie
management will be very fortunate if it can
go on doing as well. A society which at
this business can make well over 8 p.c. on
capital and reserves combined, without tak-
ing the risk of handling more than a trifle
of other people’s money, certainly seems to
know its job.

This is a trading co. pure and simple. Of

practically all in stock (£69,978). That a

ties of no more than £21.570 should hold
stock of that size is only possible through
the small investment in premises combined
with a cash trade. Including prepaid charges
the sundry debtors amount to only. £2BOB.
The co. is thus able to handle a business of
remarkable size in proportion to the capital
invested. But if the co. hasn’t its own
capital invested in premises it must have
somebody else’s; and with certain qualifica-
tions the value of the premises is preference
capital which doesn’t figure in the balance-
sheet. There is this! however, to be said:
supposing business falls away, the hired
pi emises can be left and the capital thus
represented ceases to be a burden. On the
other hand, capital represented by premises
doesn’t carry a fixed maximum interest, since
the rent Is liable to go up as the-business
becomes more profitable. Apparently this is
wluit lias been happening. At any rate,
whereas the gross profit on trading in 1914
was £55186 and the rent, taxes and operat-
ing exes, were £41,780, in the past year the
gross profit was £53,896 and the rent, taxes
and operating exes, were up to £45,788. No
doubt there were other factors —increased
wages and taxes, for instance. Anyhow,
there is the fact —gross trading profit was
£1290 less, while rent, taxes and operating
exes, were £4OOB more; and the result is
shown in a severely cut net profit. Even
now, however, the margin of profit over the
124 p.c. dividend is equal to 7 p.c. of the
present capital of £44,813. Both principal
and profit depend very largely upon the
stocktaking. No independent check of that
lias been made this year; but 12 months ago,
for the satisfaction of shareholders, an out-
side expert was called in, and he reported
all well. As to the future, the trade is in
goods which will be called for even in less
prosperous conditions. In fact, under such
conditions, the co. is likely to attract a cer-
tain amount of custom which went in other
times to shops that wouldn’t think of put-
ting a familiar name like “Joe’" on their
signpost.

There must be a Reason for the fact that the great bulk of the
motor-car owners of the world are Ford owners—more than 850,000 of them.
We believe that one reason for that is the lightness of the Ford—the lightest
motor-car in the world. And that lightness means economy in tyres, in petrol,
in repairs, in general serviceability. We ask no better proof than the legion
and the tribute of Ford owners.
THE SAME SATISFACTION IN EVERY STATE (vide testimonials as under)

Messrs. Davies & Fehon Motors Ltd.
Hunter Street, SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs, —1 bought my Ford from
Mju in January, 1912. it has covered
22.000 miles since then, and has cost
me practically nothing for repairs. It
runs on this dead, loose soil on the
average of 25 miles to the gallon of
naphtha, on hard red country nearly
30 miles.
It runs as well as a new car, and a
man who knows it well offered £l4O
for it lately, but I want it.
You know there are no roads here,
only waggon tracks, and they are
bumpy and heavy. Other cars bought
about the same time have tumbled to
pieces and are now scrapped, or ought
tp be. I have had no troubles other
than punctures.
A tyre runs about 5000 miles.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) C. B. BLYTHE.

Dear Sirs, —I have very much plea-
sure in adding my experience to the
many testimonials of the Ford car.
I have had my Ford for over three
years, during which time I have
travelled 2.‘>.000 miles over rough bush
roads in all weathers. I have only
had to use my chains once, and I will
travel where any other car made can
go.
I consider the Ford the cheapest and
most durable car for Australian bush
use on the market. I have never had
any engine trouble —the one secret
is: keep the oil and water up to the
r ord and it will go on for ever.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) ROBT. C. T. GARLAND.

Messrs. Tarrant Motors l’r., Ltd.,

Dear Sirs, —I have delayed answer-
ing your enquiry re “Ford” Car so
that I could tell you the state of the
Ford car purchased from you last
October, which has been taken down
for inspection. You will be pleased
to learn that everything- is in splendid
condition, none of the engine bearings
would stand a liner being removed, and
the car has done over 15,000 miles over
back-country roads, in places where no
oilier car has been, or likely to go.
There has not been a renewal of any
kind to the car-—the petrol consump-
tion averages from 25 to 30 miles per
gallon. In mud “Fords” have no equal;
they float over bogs heavier cars sink
in to the axles.
A unique performance on this car
was from Mildura to Broken Ilill
between 0 a.in. and .12 p.m., over 300
miles, thence into the heart of Aus-
tralia, doing 1500 miles in seven days,
and I have yet to learn what a break-
down means.
I have bought two more Ford cars
from you since this one, and all are
thoroughly satisfactory. After run-
ning several high-priced English and
French cars, I am satisfied these cars
are the very ones that will do the
work in this country satisfactorily, and
at one-third the cost and less than one-
third the upkeep. They negotiate with
ease our heavy sand-ridge, where
heavy cars have serious trouble.
Wishing you every success with
these wonderful little cars.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) HUNTER YULE.

Dear Sir, —In reply to your letter of
Ist June, asking for particulars of iny
experiences, etc., with the Ford Motor,
I may state that I consider the Ford
one of the best cars on the market for
hack-country and rough work, and low
cost of upkeeping. My original car,
bought from you over two and a half
years, lias done something like 20.000
miles, and nearly all the time on hush
tracks, and is still to the fore. Of
course I have had the usual mishaps
that motors are heir to, hut the greatest
number of them have been caused
either through carelessness or inexperi-
ence. and all spares required have
been easily obtainable and adjusted.
My second car, bought last January,
has done a little over 7000 miles with-
out a hitch, and has not cost me more
than £5 for repairs, and has been on a
bush track all the time. I have
travelled through sandy country in
several other cars of different makes,
but none of them have come up to the
“Ford.” Everything in order, and
with a capable, experienced driver, you
can go anywhere.
The lightness of the car enables it
to negotiate sand where a heavier make
would not go. We do about 2o miles
on a gallon of petrol.
I am, yours truly,

Bear Sirs, —We have been using two
“Ford” cars on the above station for the
bast two years. We have found them
entirely satisfactory. They are in con-
stant use and do a lot of heavy work,
and have never yet been found wanting,
whilst the cost of upkeep, tyres and
petrol, etc., is only nominal.
I am also using a “Ford” Runabout
in connection with my big Touring car.
which I find is extremely useful. We
contemplate ordering another “Ford”
for the station at an early date.

—travelled 10,200 miles over rough,
unmade bush tracks west of Winton.
and is still going as perfectly as when
new.
The lightness of the car enables it
to get through sandy or boggy coun-
try, and also makes petrol consump-
tion low, and the tyres last long. My
second set of tyres has already run
■l7OO miles, and is good for another
■lOOO. I could not ask for better
results from the most expensive car
nlade than I am obtaining from my
“Ford.”

These are undoubtedly days oi exceptional nervous strain foi tbe
us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its f j°' an)0ll ,
lives of many of us women, and while, perhaps, a few the mo : : tll a little
us—can avoid worrying over past or prospective events, we na , « notice-
care and forethought, succeed in preventing the resuit of worry fiom be
able in our appearance. To these fortunate few this little chat w * . to ii et
as interesting and instructive as to those who stand in real-need of ll known
matters, and may be the means of bringing to their notice some hitherto
method of retaining, or regaining that beauty of face and figure *ch :« fhebutu
right of every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned be found to
not generally known to the public, but any good chemist nil usua j
have a small quantity in stock.
Freckles and How to Cure Them.—lt Is always
those with the finest and fairest skins who
freckle most easily, but this knowledge is pool-
comfort when the face is disfigured with these
nglv little blemishes. To prevent the forma-
tion of freckles, a wash should be applied to
the face which will form a shield from the
rays of the sun. A simple and inexpensive
unc can be made up at home by dissolving an
ounce of cieminite in four tablespooni'uls of
hot water. Shake the bottle, and when cold
apply to the face and allow to dry on the
skin. If this is done every day, renewing the
application whenever the face is washed, and a
little raereolised wax rubbed into the skin
every night, freckles will not make their
appearance, no matter how hot the sun. To
remove freckles which have already formed,
apply the wax every night, rub it well into
the skin of the face and neck and leave it on
lill the morning. Then wash off, using Pileuta
soap and warm water.
The Hair—To Increase the Growth. —To arrest
an undue falling of the hair and increase the
growth, scalp massage and the application of
a good tonic is absolutely necessary. Part the
hair in the centre, and starting at the forehead
massage for at least ten minutes. Then apply
a tonic. A simple and inexpensive one can he
made up at home by mixing one ounce of
boranium (which can be bought at the chem-
ist’s) with a quarter of a pint of bay rum.
Add the boranium to the bay rum, allow to
stand for half an hour, then strain and add
sufficient water to make half a pint. Dab
amongst the roots of the hair with a soft
sponge.
Blackheads, Knlarged Pores, ete.—Blackheads
are unusually troublesome things during the
summer months to those bothered in that way.
The extra warmth makes the skin “give,” and
it looks more greasy than usual, and conse-
quently the blackheads are more noticeable.
To remove them and close up the pores of the
skin dissolve a stymol tablet in a glass of hot
water, allow the effervescence to subside, then
dip a soft sponge into the liquid and bathe
the face. After a few minutes, dry the face
with a soft towel, and the blackheads will be
instantly removed.
To Reduce a Double Chin. —To reduce a double
chin, give hard, firm massage every night with
mercolised wax, stroking the flesh firmly back-
wards from the chin towards the lower portion
of the neck. Do this every night, and in the
morning bathe with cold water and iii')
the skin a little parsidium jelly. JJ"* 1 ®„ (l

Superfluous Hair.— Dark-complexioned women
are far more frequently. ";? übl q , 1 ,.s wi t
growth of superfluous hair than those
fair skins, and at the first sign of tlie*e objec
tionablfe hairs steps should be taken to remoie
them, or they will develop into a stioi g
growth which will take a very long time to
destroy. A little powdered pheminol applied
to this growth will remove the unsightly blem
ish. destroying it permanently if the haiis be
but few. Two or more applications may bt
necessary if the growth be unusually strong.
but about one ounce of pheminol should m
sufficient for the most stubborn case. Phemi-
nol can be obtained at the chemist s and a
little powdered alum should be obtained at tlit
same time for dusting the skin before applying
the pheminol.
Grey or Fading Hair.—To restore the color to
grey or fading hair add one ounce of coneen
trate of tammalite to four ounces of bay rum.
Apply to the roots with a soft sponge everj
night until the desired result is obtained, then
use the lotion two or three times a week. Alter
three or four days a decided improvement will

original color, An iron tonic will be found
most beneficial when the greyness is caused by
general debility.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.— Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should he shampooed once m
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful oi
stallax granules ill a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shamnoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse, and dry by fanning with a palm fan. 01

the hair be naturally very greasy, the oB
massage should be omitted: [•?

“F.H.” : There is a law in Victoria against
soothsaying for cash, but not much is done
by the police to deal with the professional
soothsayer. The credulous, discontented
woman is still the prey of scores of charla-
tans who are prepared to prophesy trips to
Europe or new husbands for a consideration.
Once in a blue moon the police-force dis-
guises itself with big feet, enters the dim
mystery of the prophet’s parlor, and presently
testifies in court against the prophet; but
not much ever comes of it. On the other
hand, it is a suggestive fact that one of
Melbourne’s newest, most lavishly-rococO
and nouveau-decorated “mansion homes” is
the property of a lady whose business it is
to communicate vague, high-priced nothings,
full of canny comfort and cunning advice, to
a faithful circle of chuckle-heads.
“Alamon” ; All Northern Territory hotels
came under Government control a week or
t"-o ago, and one of the suddenest shocks
that customers got was a demand for cash
down for all drinks. If you’ve ever been in
the N.T. you’ll know how easy-going the
old system was. Another facer was the abo-
lition of Sunday trading, and many an old
stager now spend a long, hot, dry Sabbbath
praying for Andy Fisher’s welfare. Private
Enterprise is forbidden to sell, attempt to
sell, offer to sell, or supply liquor, and first
offenders have to face a fine of £3OO or 12
months’ imprisonment, or both. Hence, sly-
grog selling- is dead —for the present. As
booze can be lawfully supplied only by the
Government store, and sold only by State
hotels, probably the N.T. will become more
temperate, if not teetotal, in the future. The
hotels at Katherine and Brock’s Greek are
closed, and the three in Darwin and one. in
Pine Creek are run by employee*. - whose job-
depends on observing the law. A mail might
as well be at the war!

1914: The contract for the removal of the Kelp
Rock is progressing as well as can be expected, con-
sidering the bad weather. The plant and tools are
complete, and in every way fitted for this important
work..
1915; it was decided, after thoroughly investigat-
ing the circumstances in connection with this work,
that‘it would be a distinct advantage to Currie
Harbor if the Kelp Rock were not removed. The
contract was accordingly cancelled. _
And then Tasmania wonders why its loans
are so unproductive that it has to make up
the shortage in interest-earnings by paying
£1 16s. lOd. per head in taxation while the
average for the Commonwealth is only
£1 ss. lid. per head.
r> , ,
Poor, hard-up little Tasmania is finding
out, like the rest of them, that wheat-specu-
lating isn’t the game it is cracked up to be.
When it couldn’t get what it wanted from
the mainland it turned to America, and the
Yankee unloaded a lot of inferior stuff. The
Government reckoned it wouldn’t be safe to
get only just enough to last till November,
because something might happen to this har-
vest too; so it has a pretty big stock on
hand which it can’t afford to sell for less
than about 75., while mainland stuff can be
landed for 4s. 9d- There are only two things
to be done. It can either keep the price
propped up, or take the natural price and
call the difference a loss. In either case
the public pays, in the first case in its
bread bill or in the alternative in its taxes,
In either case the Yankee scores.
~ , . „ ,
Mackinnon, Victoria s Attorney-General,
mumbles his reply to the demand that the
borrow-and-boom policy should stop:—
We must not shut down all round, dismiss people
and create a panic by wholesale stoppage, but weather
the crisis without interfering with the lives of the
people - -
Of course, nobody wants the absurd person
to create a panic. All that is asked of him
is to cease wearing out his boots on the way
to the mont-de-piete and get out of his skull
the demented notion that by pawning the
people he is helping them, instead of sowing
tares and docks and alligator’s teeth.
Thus a man in the business
The action of the Federal Government in suspend-
ing the trade mark of “aspirin” (German drug) in
favor of two Victorian chemists may be all right,
provided that after the war German rights are not
re-instated. If they are re-instated, then Hughes
will find that he could have devised no better way
of keeping the nest nice and warm for the Hun
than by thus preserving in the public mind the word
“aspirin.” One condition is that the Australian-
produced “aspirin” must comply with the tests for
acetyl salicylic acid, British Pharmacopeia. If
aspirin answers to these tests then it is acetyl sal.
acid, and acetyl sal. is aspirin, and no patent
rights should be granted. Is this Hughes’s idea of
collaring German trade?
Last year N. S. Wales borrowed eight

Yawn Murray woke up in the Vic. Assem-
bly the other evening to explain that, though
J . . . . , , .
cerebro-spinal meningitis had been leaping
about the State for six months (508 cases
reported, 206 fatal), the Board of Health
had “not looked up the law” relating to its
power to isolate- patients. Yawn didn’t say
whether he would ask someone to inquire what
the statutes provide, but people in the know
are reported to suspect that if he can
manage to get sufficient sleep during the
next financial year he will peremptorily
demand au invefetigation .
“Mil”: A proof of the humanness of
Caucus selection lies in the fact that it
reflects the mistakes of the electors. Kink
O’Malley, who hangs on shakily to the Dar-
win seat, got himself elected as Minister
despite his record as a puller-down of Labor
Governments, thereby proving that all the
thoughtless people are not on the West Coast
of Tasmania. Archibald was not the limit
in administrative ability, but the principal
objection to him was that, in a time of finan-
dal stress, he did not give way to every
demand for more nay or less work. The in-
teresting thing ahead is the watching of
O’Malley attempting to redeem promises to
the ca’ canny section of the unions, and
contemporaneously putting into action those
fine business ideas he learned in Amurrika
—ideas consisting mainly of The substitution
of red ink for black, and designed to save
everything except life and money. It’s a
good reflection on Australia that the Caucus
can’t find an Australian-born hot-air mer-
chant equal to O’Malley. I’ve seen a dozen
O’Malleys on Broadway selling jewellery at
a dollar a quart. Yet' he is chosen from a
party including Watkins, Bamford, Page and
other good Australians. But none of these
five at the Trades Hall or belong to the
Underminers’ Union, neither are they any
good at rolling a log or pushing their own
barrows.
An Opticians Bill is promised by
the N. S. Wales Parliament. It is
time. Only a week or so ago a person was
advertising for “Yg men, good add., no prev.
exp. necy.” to “work” a district for the sale
of spectacles: and, of course, a cash pay-
ment was required in return for a “guar-
antee” of £5 per week over expenses. What
may happen to the eyes of people who
are treated by yg. men of good add. and no
prev. ex. can be told by hundreds of victims.
The Legislature should have jumped years
ago on a business that is not only plain
robbery but eye-murder in addition.
“Orion,” back from S’Africa:—
A Dutch parson named Von Horst, who was a
candidate for Parliament at the recent S’African
election, distinguished himself by using the gag that
the Almighty could trust General Hertzog in the
dark but not the British, and that was' why He
never let the sun set on the Empire. After the count
of votes, which gave Botha an easy majority, the
predekant forgot to say that evidently Heaven had
lost confidence in Hertzog; nor did he explain why,
when a word from Hertzog could have stopped the
preparations for rebellion, he never spoke it. Now
poor old De Wet and a crowd of others are in
Johannesburg gaol, while the real instigator of the
riot sits grinning in Parliament.
“Rainbow” : The British Board of Trade
has decided to alter the “wool” test in the
color-vision examinations. For years the
aspirant for a certificate as a mate has had
to pass what is known as the Hofmgj'en
examination. Given a collection of wool
skeins of every hue except black and white,
he has had to match those picked by the
examiner. If he could decide by day a crim-
son lake from a burnt sienna he was ad-
judged capable of telling a green light from
a red one by night. Science long ago de-
nounced this system as imperfect, and ad-
vised the adoption of the obviously correct
test of real lights. The object of the test is
not to find out if a sailor is “color
ignorant,” but whether he can distin-
guish a ship's lights. - After lengthy per-
suasion the British Board adopted a lantern
test in addition to the wool test, with many
misgivings and shakings of its grey old head.
So successful has it been that the Board
announces the abolition of the wool test als
from January 1, 1916. After that date
aspiring masters and mates will be examined
only by means of red, white and green lights.
V “Glen”: Before the war the Port-Mel-
bourne rifle-range was visited on Saturdays
by a fairly solid crowd of regular attendants,
year in and year out. When bloodshed
began a swarm of learners came along. At
that stage one had to play a patient wait-
ing-game to get a whack at a target. Then
came the voluntary drill-movement, wifh the
rifle clubs as organising centres.. That fairly
clogged the range with shooting-students;
and numbers of these trainees enlisted. in
due course. But, with every club clamoring
on Saturdays for two or three targets, there
was an inevitable lack of shooting facilities.
Now, with the need for trained shots as
pressing as ever, the attendances are slack-
ening, and beyond doubt the shortage of
targets is the reason for it. For
a year or more an agitation for an
open range to the east of Melbourne
(so far served by miniature ranges only) has
been engaging the bored attention of the
Defence Department; but, beyond the in-
spection of one or two possible sites, nothing
visible has been done. The present is no
time for procrastination. Either this busi-
ness of learning to shoot is necessary or it
isn’t. If it isn’t, why the Port Melbourne
range? If it is, why this apparent content-
ment with an inadequate system after 15
months of war?
Assisted by private donors, the Vic. Edu-
cation Department has built a semi-rural
school for poorly-nourished city children.
It is at Blackburn, a bush-and-orchard dis-
trict 11 miles out of town, and the pupils
come daily by train from Melbourne’s
closely-settled areas. Stretching a point,
the Railway Department charges only
a shade over a shilling weekly for each
child’s fare, while for the tucker supplied by
the. Education authorities another shilling
or so is asked. Both these payments are
made by the parents of the children. Mrs.
William Keast, whose husband is M.L.A.
for Dandenong, started the agitation which
led to the establishment of the school, and
most of the cash for the building was col-
lected by her. The experiment has not been
conducted long enough to establish results;
but, since the Education Department seems
to be taking no great financial risks in the
matter, the good work will probably be
allowed to go on.
An art note (more or less) from Colies,
the black-and-white man:—
Ever since landing here in Gallipoli I have been
under intermittent fire; practically all the time.
But it wasn’t until a few weeks ago that I found
myself involved in an argument that lasted continu-
ously for one day and through the night and into the
following morning. It was a case of advance and
counter-attack and counter-counter-attack, and a lot
of my good Australian brothers fell. Just about dawn
I was one of those relieved. We were then occupying
captured ground, and from the characteristic maze
of shrubs, hillocks, pits, abominable stenches and
other horrors I was glad to clumsily drag away to
where a narrow track began a precipitous descent
into the gully.
Next night, feeling chippier, I was having a sea-
bathe, when a "chap in the water near me
mentioned Manly. He was, it seems, one of the force
I had met going up to their baptism of fire. With
a lurking hope, I asked after my Sydney artist
chums. To my surprise he told me that there was
a chap named Cecil Hartt in his company; but, he
added, he was one of those who’d gone out in the
charge that morning and hadn’t come back. “But
see that bloke up there,” he continued, pointing to
a group further up on the beach-—“ask him. He’s
in the same platoon.” I went and accosted a ser-
geant. “A long streak, ain’t he ? Struth, yes 1 He’s
all right. He came back with me —wounded in th’
thigh an’ shoulder Yes, he wuz sent off fer ’is
’oliday—but quite all'right!”
So, in the same disturbance which provided my
initiation, artist Cecil Hartt made his dSbut and a
sudden but honorable exit. It was hard luck to thus
just miss meeting him. But there’s plenty of time
yet; there’s tons of encores in this show —and < we
could do with a lot more performers.

ONE special advantage of
a bicycle built through-
out of B.S.A. Fittings is the
interchangeability of each
part. Should you lose or
damage any part any agent
can supply you with an exact
duplicate from stock, and it
is certain to fit because every
B.S.A. part is guaranteed to
one thousandth part of an
inch. Interchangeability is
an exclusive feature never
associated with a so-called

Testimony of Mr. M. J. Hassett, Hotel Sydney, Pitt St.
Bth Jan., 1915.
It is with a feeling of deep gratitude that I write
to fell you of the relief I got from using your valu-
able remedy. I have been suffering severely for
some time with Eczema. I got treatment from two
doctors, several chemists and several patent medi-
cines that were recommended to me. They all failed
to cure me. I was eventually recommended to try
your valuable skin cure. I got relief after the first
application, and now I am very pleased to say com-
pletely cured. I have very great pleasure in recom-
mending your valuable skin cure to any person who
may be in need of it.—:Yours truly, M. J. HASSETT.

IN
BANANA LAND
Dropped dead in his office at Brisbane on
November 2, Thomas William Connah,
Auditor-General for Queensland since 1907.
He was born at Birkenhead (Eng.) and
arrived in Brisbane 49 years ago. After a
term as accountant for Gibbs, Bright and
Go. he entered the Audit Department in ’72,
and had climbed up to be Under-Secretary
ac the Treasury in 1901. He was a year or
two over 70 when the books were closed.
“A.T.E.”: Bananaland Judges are on a
soft wicket. This is one of the latest dis-
coveries made by inquisitive young Fihelly,
the Assistant Minister for Justice, who has
acquired a nasty habit of making inconveni-
ent “discoveries.” The Beaks, it appears,
regulate their own expenses by the simple
device of drawing exactly what they want
Nobody but themselves knows how the
money is spent, as they simply draw a
cheque to bearer and no vouchers are sup-
plied to the Dept, to show how, when,
where or why the cash goes. Fihelly re
marked that “the system was susceptible of
improvement.” Not at all! At least, not
from the point of view of the Judges. Also
why should business methods be introduced
into Government Departments? In any case,
only public funds are affected, so why worry?
“F.H.”: Captain Parry-Okeden, the
Queenslander mentioned in lan Hamilton’s
just-published despatches, spent a long time
in the Melbourne Domain, prior to leaving
these shores, as a lieutenant with the Divi-
sional Ammunition Park under Colonel Tun-
bridge. He is a very tall, large, capable
young man ; and he had the luck to be at
Gallipoli when most of the D.A.P. was
bailed up in England. At the Front he was
early given a provisional captaincy. By the
way, Tunbridge, who has only lately got out
of England, was one of the Australians in
the scrap at Eland’s River, when a few
mixed troops stood off six times as many
Boers for a fortnight or so, from behind a
rampart of very dead horses, in “the most
distinguished action of the war.”
A Brisbane daily, descanting lately on the
agricultural industry, quoted the names of
several well-known Queenslanders as having
been that State’s most • successful planters.
But the most spiendidlv-cffjcibik planter of
all was never mentioned. ' Fifty years ago
Gore, of. Yandilla, set in his -garden a little
spiny thing, and gave orders to his gardener
to water it carefully, as it was a tender
specimen. The gardener forgot it, and was
sacked. But the plant grew on, and to-day
30,000,000 acres of Queensland are covered
with prickly-pear descended from the pam-
pered pet of Yandilla homestead. As a
“successful planter” Gore, himself a sprig of
an old and prolific Parramatta family, beats
all Australian records.
“J.F.IL”: Any pioneer settlers in the
Gulf Country ever heard of an early ex-
plorer called Benjamin Woodrow? He has
passed out at Baxter, Derbyshire, England,
at 74, and left behind him a tidy £65,760.
accumulated as chairman of Woodrow and
Sons, Ltd., the well-known Stockport hat
manufacturers. The obituaries allege that
he “went to Australia in his early days, and
took part in many exploring expeditions,
being among the first to penetrate the wild
regions, in the vicinity of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria.”
Home Secretary Bowman, speaking at the
Ipswich Workshops:—
Britain and her Allies would come out on top, and
lie had little hesitation in saying that the forces
behind Britain and her Allies would secure success
for their arms. (Loud applause.)
If the public men of Australia would
frankly tell their audiences, that the Austro-
Gerrnan may easily “come out on top” un-
less Britain equals the enemy in effort and
sacrifice, the result would be healthier for
all of us.
OBVIOUS.
BIG ’U N: " How is it that I do twice as much work as you and only yet the same pay?”
LITTLE ’ UN: “Brains, of course !”
A good word can be said even for the
drought. It is the most deadly enemy of
that beautiful pest—the water hyacinth. In
dry times swamps and backwaters vanish,
and the hyacinth bulbs perish, while the
salt water coming further up-stream kills
the floating pla.nfs ifi thousands. But to
prickly-pear drought is a matter of sublime
indifference.
Brisbane Worker announces that “with
►Socialism would come the reign of universal
Well, it all depends. If the same
brand of Socialism were universal, peace
might be universal, too. But, if it were not
so dead, ancient Peru, the most Socialistic
State that ever was, could say what is liable
to happen to a country that has no defence
except its Socialism so long as there are
unsocialistic brigands in the world.
In camp at Enoggera, Arthur Leslie Mer-
rotsy, who has put up a record by journey-
ing from the heart of Australia, where he
was with a survey party, to put another nail
in the German’s coffin. The first 180 miles
was per camel, the next 500 by horse, and
then 140 from Pine Creek by train. He
started on August 12 and got to Darwin five
weeks later; and eight days after that a
steamer dropped him at Brisbane.
The real problem of Bananaland is the
prickly-pear. Two years ago a keg of
cochineal insects were imported from
Colombo and dumped on to it magnificent
growth near Charters Towers. To-day that
pear is a wreck, and selectors are howling to
the Lands Department that if any more of
the vegetable is destroyed they won’t have
stock food during droughts. If the present
< 'V sn<dl continues, pear poisoners like Dr.
Jean Bell and Oliver Cromwell Roberts may
have to clear for their lives.
Geo. Rylands, once M.L.A. for Gyrnpie
and the deadliest enemy the Parliamentary
Refreshment Bar ever knew, is again to the
fore. After being defeated for Gyrnpie George
was made Director of Lands and Forests in
the Northern Territory, and achieved dis-
tinction by coming out on strike and doing
picket duty at the call of the A.W.U. He
aspires to-day to fill the shoes of Andy
Fisher at Wide Bay, and is up for the party
nomination.
“Tom” Chataway, ex-Senator for Banana-
land, who was politically drowned in the
flood which obliterated the Liberal' Senate
bunch last election, is at present driving a
quill in the Transport Service.
Captain Thomas Bennett, an auld Scots
engineer who began to apostrophise the
firemen about 70 years ago, lias obeyed the
Last Order at Bundaberg. He served his
apprenticeship on the Clyde, and then be-
came “guarantee man” for Lairds. His
first job afloat was aboard Queen Victoria’s
gift-yacht when it was sent to the Pasha of
Egypt. After that he had a turn .as chief
engineer on a mail-boat running between
Barcelona and Minorca. He landed in
Brisbane in 66, had charge of the engines
in Gibbs, Bright’s Hero and the alleged
warship Cerebus successively. Jobs as chief
of an E. and A. boat and of dredges working
in the Burnett and Fitzroy Kivers fol-
lowed. After a spell as chief engineer of
the 860-ton flagship of Queensland’s toy
navy, the Gayundah, Bennett joined the
Marine Board, and stuck to it till it was
reconstructed. _ He obtained the rank of
captain by virtue of being engineer-com-
mander when he retired from Bananaland’e
navy. The log showed 90 when the “stop?*
was rung down.
In Khaki.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As boys in khaki stepped the street
With trimly-shouldered rifle,
What meant that hurried bosom-beat.
That thought I could not stifle?
What meant that question in my brain
That out me ever deeper:
“If Trueman fights and I refrain,
Am I my brother’s keeper?”
i saw the trenches in my dream,
The boys within them straining
To catch the word at which they stream
To death-grips uncomplaining;
T saw them fall in twos and threes
Before the ruthless Reaper:
They never doubted once, did these,
They were their brother’s keeper.
And once again the vision changed.
The Turkish sea-line faded,
And back again my fancy ranged
To creek and cottage shaded ;
The children reft and fatherless,
The widow wan, the weeper
Gazed up and asked in pale distress:
“Art thou thy brother’s keeper?”
And whensoe’er I hear the drum
Roll out fits fateful measure
Or watch the lads whose hour has come
Take leave of them they treasure,
Within my soul there rings a cry:
“What aileth thee, O sleeper?
How canst thou ask while brethren die :
‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’ ”
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 6, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah, —
What do you think. To-day at the races
his Ex. actually interrupted the proceedings
after the third race to deliver a recruiting
speech! On the sacred racecourse! My hat,
this war is undermining our grand old tra-
ditions ! Lady Goold-Adams, who encour-
aged her husband in this break-away, kept
faith, however, with the tradition which re-
quired her to decorate the winner of the
Derby with the blue ribbon. In return for
this compliment the ungrateful beast en-
deavored to devour the vegetation on Ihe
vice-regal hat.
The froeking on the lawn was mostly of
the airy, fairy, summery type. Lady Goold-
Adams was in blue. Mrs. Jack Thomson,
the best-dressed woman present, paraded in
floral ninon over pink, with a rose-crowned
hat. Mrs. Isaac Moore, Mrs. Wliittiiigham,
Mrs. Boss Munro and others of the squatto-
c.racy appeared in white. Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson, in pink and white striped voile, was
a living denial of the current idea that
stripes are not the right choice for the tall
and slender.
Mrs. T. W. Bouchard paid for afternoon
tea at Rowe’s Cafe on Monday, in honor of
her daughter, who will soon forsake the way
of the bachelor-girl. There were about 60
bearers of congratulations at the teacups.
Dr. Doyle and his handsome wife have
forsaken Queensland for Hobart’s milder
summer.
Another medico who has deserted us —to
take a longer journey—is Dr. Costello Sliqw,
who is in Melbourne, on his way to the big
Mix-up. His wife and daughter are staying
in Melbourne until he gets his marching
orders.
The Brisbane Liedertafel provided a con-
cert on Tuesday night for a very large and
music-hungry audience. Lena Hammond
was the she soloist, and her fine contralto
voice was at pure-tone level. She warbled
in a frilly lavender gown, relieved with
black —a gown that her grandmother might
have worn, and certainly would have
worn if she had seen how fascinating her
grand-daughter looked in it.
If there are any German toys on sale this
( liristinas they seem to be carefully disguised,
i’he displays in the shops are mostly
.Japanese samples of work that Australia
should be doing on the spot. Incidentally,
toy-making ought to be a good industry for
returned soldiers. Has anybody 'got a
barrow-load of tariff bricks handy?
Colonel King, who has been trying to get off
lo the war ever since it began, has at last
attained his wish. He has been given com-
mand of the No. 2 Australian Remount
I nit. ihe residents of Gowrie and there-
abouts farewelled the fine old soldier the
other evening, and passed him some material
evidence of their regard.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

mixed at home or put up by any chemist,
will quickly remove dandruff and stop the
hair from falling out.
To a half-pint of water add loz. of bay
rum, one small box of Orlex Compound and
}oz. of glycerine. These are all simple in-
gredients that you can buy from any chem-
ist at very little cost, and mix them yourself.
Apply to the scalp once a day for two
weeks, then once every other week until the
mixture is used. A half-pint should be
enough to rid the hair of dandruff and kill
the dandruff germs. It stops the hair from
falling out and relieves itching and scalp
disease.
Although it is not a dye it acts upon the
hair roots, and will darken streaked, faded,
grey hair in 10 or 35 days. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair
soft and glossy. 17
IMPORTANT.
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as- possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Hough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

“.Taques”: The Newcastle (N.S.W.) col-
liery proprietors have many worries, and one
they would like to be relieved of is how it is
that every sailing vessel laden with their
product arriving in South America from
Australia discharges from 10 to 100 tons
less than the quantity shipped and weighed
by Government scales at Newcastle. The
vessel’s holds appear to be in the same con-
dition when she arrives as when she left,
yet the Chilian and Peruvian weights say
she is always short. Does any Bulletin
mystery-solver know if climatic conditions
interfere with the weight of coal?
* * * *
“Warre” : You know how a “gun” works
the three broads. He generally goes to
gaol. The State employs people to nab him.
Well, this is how another sort of game is
worked, and this gun keeps a motor-car.
Cocky consigns a truck of prime chaff to
his agent in the city. The day’s yarding
comprises the usual amount of medium and
inferior stuff. The prime lots are sold “pri-
vately,” say at ss. per cwt. The medium
and inferiors are auctioned, with top price
about 3s. 9d. The agent who sold the prime
stuff for ss. sends an intimation to cocky
that he sold at 4s. 3d. per cwt., having
managed by “selling privately to get an ad-
vance of 6d. per cwt. on the top price of
the day, the yarding comprising a large
quantity of prime chaff.” Cocky looks up the
auction sales in the press and is satisfied.
He got 6d. more than top price all right—
and the agent snares a cheap advt. and 9d.
per cwt. on a six-ton truck. When will the
fool-producers learn to co-operate?
* * * *
“Fax” : A few sanguine Victorian citizens
may have saved a quid or two this Cup time
at the instance of M. P. Adams. That ver-
satile young man (he is just now conducting
a lightning tour of Bailey’s “On Our Selec-
tion” Co.- —27 country towns in 3S days)
was lately managing Irma Caron’s Concert
Co. on the Gippsland circuit. During a
pause in the programme Adams, who is a
conjurer, unfurled an umbrella on the
platform and gave the audience a prac-
tical demonstration of how the thimble-
rigger and the three-card man deal with their
prey. He could generally induce somebody
to try. his hand at picking the pea; after
which he would give a touch-of topical in-
terest to the turn by addressing words of ex-
hortation to any misguided young men in
the audience who might be going to Mel-
bourne for the races.
* * * *
“Hori”: “Jaques” (B. 7/10/T5) is right
when he says that the claim to be the oldest
steamer afloat lies between the Stormbird
and the Edina, both built and launched in
1854. The Stormbird left the Broomielaw,
Glasgow, for Melbourne on .Tune 17, 1854.
She was consigned to Graham, Sands and
Co., Collins-street, and was intended for use
as a tender to the steamers Sovereign (after-
wards lost in the South Passage. Moreton
Bay) and the Prince of Wales (converted
into a coal hulk at Panama). These vessels
were to have run a mail service from Mel-
bourne to Panama, but the Crimean War
upset the scheme. Just when the Edina was
launched and sailed for Australia I don’t
know, but that date would help to settle the
argument as to which is the older boat. The
claim of the British steamer Ceres may be
worthy of support for second place, biit a
sailing ship turned steamer can hardly be
treated as having been a steamer all the
time. Another English claimant was the
Collier, built in ’4B ; but for many years she
was only an auxiliary steamer. The French
built the 1200-ton liner Orient in 1855; that
was their pioneer. The Stormbird is still
going strong, apparently as sound as' ever,
in the Wanganui-Wellington trade. The
Edina has retired from business.
* * * *
“T.D.”: Only a very reckless prodigal
would expect the fatted calf these days. At
Burnie (Tas.) a Durham bullock fattened
by the V.D.L. Co. for the Melbourne Royal
Show (which did not come off this year)
.was sold for £l2O. This is claimed as a
world’s record and is a big rise on the Aus-
tralian record of £7B held by a beast sold a
few weeks ago at Newmarket. The weight
of the V.D.L. bullock as he stands is nearly
30001 b., but, even so, the price works out at
about lOd. per lb. live weight.
* * * *
Angaston, a quiet little fruit-growing dis-
trict in S. Aus., is rippling with joy. Its
marble is to be used in Australia House in
London. It owns a first-class quarry, and
three or four thousand feet have been
ordered from it. Since Parliament House in
Adelaide was enlarged the industry had been
starved; but now six-ton*- blocks are being
turned out, and soon Andy Fisher will be
passing up staircases, and between columns,
and through doorways that have come from
home.
THE PANACEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a special meeting of the Canterbury (N.S.AV.)
Council consideration was given to the construction
of 1835 J chains of road works, at a cost of £60,000,
which it is proposed to borrow.... The proposal was
unanimously approved. —News item.
Folly, war and drought
Have almost knocked us out—
The Ma State staggers under killing loads ;
But suburban councils still
Can increase our little bill
By raising sixty-thousands pounds for roads.
In the olden days
The rates they used to raise—
A course at variance with modern modes ;
And a practice we’ve outgrown ;
Nowadays we raise a loan
■ To repair our worn-out, unproductive roads.
Or to build new, costly, mostly-useless roads !
Of course, it wouldn’t do
For us to buckle-to,
And lay the things ourselves past our abodes.
No, no! Or peace or war
We will borrow (as before),
And Posterity shall pay for our new roads—
Our futile and inutile little roads.
And good enough for ’em, for what’s Posterity
but a lot of useless and ungrateful little
toads!

BANKRUPT NERVES,
Each of us has a certain supply of ner-
vous energy. Every act, even every thought,
uses up some part of this energy. During
rest ahd sleep the supply is increased by tiie
blood, which gets the needed elements from
the air we breathe and the food we eat.
Your nervous energy is like a bank
account. If you use it up faster than ybu
add to it you overdraw your account. Neu-
rasthenia is the name given to nervous bank-
ruptcy. It means that the power to recupe-
rate is gone.
The bl7)od can be built up so that it will
increase the supply of needed elements to the
wasted nerves, and this is the only way that
the nerves can be reached. Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills are a tonic that especially builds
up the nerves, because they supply to the
blood the elements that the nerves need.
Many nervous disorders, sometimes chronic
ones, have yielded to this tonic treatment
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills when other
methods failed to give relief. They are cer-
tainly worthy of a trial in every case of
weak nerves and thin blood.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are cold by chem-
ists everywhere, or will be sent by mail, post
paid, on receipt of price, 2/9 per box, six
boxes 15/3, by the Dr. Williams’ Medicine
Co., Sydney. Write to-day for a free book,
“Nervous Disorders.”*
Cause of Much Trouble.
Constipation is more frequent in women
than in men. It is almost always present in
old age.
Many results of constipation are attri-
buted to something else. Constipation causes
pimples and eruptions. By pressing on the
veins it causes cold ankles and feet and pro-
duces varicose veins. It may cause neu-
ralgia. Constipation often makes children
delicate and feeble.
The remedy is to stimulate the liver by
the use of Pinkettes, the gentle laxative pills
that do not gripe or purge, but simply assist
nature. Taken regularly for a time, they
really do correct constipation.
Write to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co./
Sydney, mentioning The Bulletin, for a
free sample; or get a full-size Is. bottle of
Pinkettes from your own chemist.*

DRY DADD ON
BABY’S FACE

Red and Ugly Looking. Used to

Cuticura Soon Healed.
♦
109 A George St., Erskineville, Aust.—
“The beginning of last year my baby's lace
caught the sun and formed a dry rash; it
was red and ugly looking and looked bad.
She was getting her teetti so I put it down
at first to them, but it looked worse every
day. It used to irritate her and she would
scratch it and for t lie time it caused dis-
figurement. It was bad for over a month
and I really thought it was eczema.
“Seeing the advertisement I sent for Cu-
ticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment. I
washed it with tlie Cuticura Soap using it
freely and then applied the Cuticura Oint-
ment. 1 continued doing this and site was
soon cured and now no marks remain.

BOOTS have come back again and no mistake.
But such dreams of boots, up-to-date,
dainty, delightful, lit accompaniment to the
flounced taffeta frocks of the day, which
combine smart modernity with old-world charm.
Paris and London both are now tripping to work
and play in short-fronted, high-heeled, suede-
topped boots like the Bostock style here illus-
trated.
It is a smart little boot, there is no doubt
about that, and every bit as comfortable as it is
smart. The beautifully fitting last on which it is
made sees to that, and lots of women, who have
never imagined thc\ could wear a short fronted
style, will be amazed to find how comfortable it
is, how jolly it. makes their feet look.
Then for those who want something different,
who prefer shoes perhaps, there is a line range of
styles to select from, all as up-to-date and charm-
ing as this model, and all safe to wear well and
feel as peculiarly one’s own as if they had been
made to measure.

‘'Fax" : Lindsay Russell (of “Smouldering
Fires”), who is now Pattie Scott, writes
from London about her literary doings
I have signed a contract that will run my annual
income into four figures. 1 get £5OO as deposit
alone on two Lindsay Russell books a year, and 1
have contracted to bring’ out two K. H. Quinn
books. I’m said to have the biggest sales of any
“colonial” author now, and certainly my (10,000
copies of one book alone startled me when 1 saw
the - .record. I have indeed been lucky. I've ju-t fin-
ished “The Zandsee”—it goes into press at once, and
will be in Australia in November. This comes out
side by side with “The Gates of Silence," also
“Flickering Flame,” the best thing 1 have ever
done or will do for a long while, it is the story of
one who came back from the Dead for three more
years on earth.
Somebody called Lindsay Russell the Aus-
tralian Corelli. But she can write better
lines than Marie Corelli was ever paid big
money for. She's a poetess who thinks in
melodrama.
‘“Hois” : lie Kink O’Malley (8.21/10-/M5).
One very good reason why his O’Malleyisms
are so generally disregarded is that they
have been found out. For instance, take
the sample quoted: “The three greatest
organisations the world has ever seen are
the R.C. Church, the Standard Oil Co. and
the Germany army." You’ll find that one if
you look in a book called “The German-
Amerienn Plot,” by F. \Y. Wile (page TO).
“The Incubus”: The death of .1. A. Millar.
Maoriland's ex-Minister of Railways, re-
minds me of the time I followed him to the
West Coast of the South Island. There were
two reporters in his entourage, one for the
Liberal and one for the Conservative rags,
and Millar was supposed to be inspecting
the railways and coal-mines. We made a
happy party, the pressmen halving the
speechifying and working amicably together,
'flic people of the West Coast, where the
big mining rushes used to take place, are
hosts who shake hands and say "What's
yoursV” every time they look at you. So
we had a wet trip for a fortnight, with
banquets in every town. One night we had
all come home from a gorge, and were
having a last one in the Ministers sitting-
room, when the then Speaker of Maoriland's
I louse got very solemnly on to his soles and
proposed the health of Millar,jstating inci-
dentally that he was sure their guest had
not reached the top of the political tree, and
things like that. My pal of the Conserva-
tive rag had been well stunned at the ban-
quet, but he woke up and heard the remarks
and began to write furiously. Then he
rushed off towards the local telegraph office.
After the Minister's secretary had held him
down and taken the copy from him we road
by the local moonlight the headings. "Is
There a Split in the Liberal Party?” “Sig-
nificant Statement by Speaker.” “Will
Millar Succeed Ward?” We put. that re-
porter to bed and tore the copy up. lon
Ward was at that time very, very shaky,
and it is a safe bet that the publication of
those splurgings would easily have swamped
the then-foundering Liberal party. It's won-
derful what a combination of whisky and
reporter can accomplish.

“Mujik” : He' was standing on a box in
the Domain, a frowsy-looking person, sur-
rounded by a number of individuals whom
I identified as Senators. I don’t know what
he was talking about, but ak the rabble fre-
quently broke into cheers here it is, and it
shows the manner in which some people are
allowed to abuse the right of free speech :
The Government, suspecting that the people might
want to know what was going on, made the business
of telling them a State monopoly. Reporters were
excluded, and an official appointed to write an account
of the proceedings which would convey no information
tu one side or the other. It was also arranged
that other officials should revise the information that
wasn’t there, by striking out all reference to what it
was about. By this means the conspiracy that is
always afoot to prevent public servants doing their
worst was nipped in the bud, and the public was
furnished with matter of no value whatever. When
the people were made aware through other channels
of what had occurred they were at once able to see
how kind the Government had been in not allowing
them to be disturbed through reading matter which
had the circumstances been different might have been
of another character. As an ardent supporter of
the voluntary system I ask you to think of what
would have been the result if it had been known
that
Ac this stage seven constables rushed into
the crowd and arrested the speaker under
the War Precautions Act. Good enough for
him, anyhow.

“lyaniva” : Died recently in London, Hugh
Spottiswoode, who, since 1903, has been
responsible for Printers’ Pie, a publication
which has raised large sums for literary and
printing-trade philanthropic funds. Spot-
tiswoode annually entertained all the writers
and artists who helped him fill the Pie, and
a couple of years ago his guests returned the
hospitality with a “Pirates’ Dinner” —
sanded floor, candles in bottles, fearful deeds,
etc. The captive, Spottiswoode, was brought
to trial, found guilty, and handcuffs of silver
were fastened round his wrists, engraved
with the words, “To bind us closer hand in
hand.”

“O’Phimerty”: Katherine S. Prichard,
the Hodder and Stoughton prize-book
writer, comes of an Australian writing-
family. Her father, T. 11. Prichard, edited
Melbourne Sun for some years, and after-
wards took charge of Launceston Daily
Telegraph. He published a novel, “Retali-
ation,” which had little vogue, and has
dropped into oblivion. An uncle, F. .T.
Prichard, has edited Launceston Examiner
for many years. The rival dailies of the
city on the Tamar were at one time piloted
by the two brothers. Katherine has a bro-
ther who writes for Melbourne Argus. Her
only other brother studied law, dropped it
for medicine, graduated at Melbourne, and
is now with an Army Medical Corps in
Europe.
Defence-Minister Pearce has a streak of
verbal resource. “It should add to its title
and call itself the Stone Age” was his com-
ment on an article in the Syme paper
urging economy in the use of motor-cars by
the Defence Department. Far from going
back to tipdrays for the convenience of camp
commandants and others, Pearce says he is
seriously thinking of an aeroplane.

DEREK HUDSON, the Popular Baritone,
DEREK HUDSON,
as Jose in
“Gipsy Love.”
(.From a photo.)
m
Praises
REXONA
Derek Hudson invests everj
role in which he appears
with his own personal charm
and manliness, and it is those
qualities, allied with his
magnificent baritone voice,
that have made him the idol
of the Theatre-going Public,
particularly that section of
it still in its teens.
It is as Jose in “Gipsy
Love” and Slippery Jack in
“The Marriage Market” that
Australian audiences know
and admire Mr. Hudson so
much. He writes to us as
follows: —-
I want to recommend
your Rexona and your
Rexona Soap, for they
deserve it.
I have used them both,
and think they are fine.
As a healer Rexona is
unequalled, and I am
sure anyone who once
tries Rexona Soap could
not help but appreciate
it. I use it for both
bathing and shaving, and
you can count on me as a
good friend, for I shall
recommend it wherever 1
go. Yours truly,
(Sgd.) DEREK HUDSON.
Everybody’s Using it Now.
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values a pure and
healthy skin. The longer you neglect your skin the harder it will be to care for it. Delay
may result in Eczema, Psoriasis, Ringworm, Running Sores, or some of the many unpleasant
forms that skin trouble so often assumes. Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and Rexona Soap are sure
preservatives for the health and skin. Rexona Soap keeps the skin soft and pure, and Rexona,
the Rapid Healer, will immediately eradicate any disease which may be apparent, for it arouses
the skin to healthy activity, so that it quickly recuperates and the diseased skin becomes once
more sound and healthy. To shave with Rexona Soap is to make one look forward to the
operation with pleasure. It produces a thick, creamy lather, and leaves the skin soft and supple
after the shaving is completed. Rexona is sold everywhere in triangular pots at 1/6, or in
larger pots, holding nearly four times the quantity, at 3/-. Rexona Soap is sold at 1/- a
tablet.

Avhite road glimmered like a ghost
I Through twilight warm as a caress,
And, like a bird, beat at my side
The fluttering softness of your dress.
The wild, dark magic of the wind
Quickened the tide through pulse and vein,
go sweetly o'er the hills it dreAV
The fragrant breath of fallen rain.
Deep-throated in its glorious mirth
; It trampled, shouting, through the trees
To tousle all your silky curls,
And whip your skirts about your knees ;
To play a thousand wilful tricks
And buffet us Avitli fingers light,
And bear us boisterous company
Down the dark avenues of night.
The dancing stars betAveen the leaves
Like gleeful children peeped and flashed,
While surging madly, Avave on aa* aA T e,
The quivering forest heaved and clashed.
Low down, the moon with silver horn
Tattered the flying drifts of cloud,
And to the harp of straining boughs
The Avind exulting chanted loud.
Uplifted on the Avings of youth,
Beneath Ave scarce could feel the clods,
But footed thistledown that sped
Puffed by the merriment of gods.
Your warm hands clung about my arm.
Your laugh outsparkled moon and star —•
Oh, Avalking step to step like this
The wide world’s end Avere not too far!
Oh. walking gaily step to step
Eternity Avere not too long,
If round us floived the starry night
Wind-shaken into joyous song.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The watch-below came suddenly on deck.
There wasn’t much of it, for it Avas
the skipper only—Peter Joyce by name ;
middle-aged, big and burly, with a black
bullet-head and a square, clean-shaven jaAV.
The other watch was steering. It, too, Avas
big and burly, but it was younger than
Joyce—fair-bearded and blue-eyed, as became
the name of Sigurdsen—Dial' Sigurdsen.
The ketch Avas doddering across the Strait
toAvards Port Phillip ; four knots or so, with
a light breeze abeam. She Avas a craft un-
beautiful, with a hull of faded red and green,
badly slacked standing-rigging, and here and
there a patch upon her dirty canvas. But
she had a pretty name —“Roxana”; which
Avas also the name of the skipper’s red-
haired Avife. Red-haired, but handsome in a
fiercely exuberant way, and not, it seemed,
unwilling to lend a shapely ear to gentle
nothings from the good-looking Norseman.
At all events, that Avas how it struck the
skipper Avhen, as has been said, he came
unexpectedly upon deck.
The Boy, who was all the rest of the
creAV, had been a Melbourne paper-selling
imp, and was sage beyond his years.
“Blime!” he said to himself, “there’ll be a
circus now, all right!”
Mrs. Joyce had walked forward, and the
Noi'Avegian was spoking the wheel over in a
hurry. Joyce stepped close.
“It’s Milbourne Ave’re makin’ for, me man
—not Kangaroo Island. How d’ye come to
be so far off yer course?”
Sigurdsen looked the other straight in the
eyes. He would brazen it out, he told him-
self. After all, wasn’t he just as good a
man as this clumsy dog of an Irelander? So
he sniggered maliciously, and spoke not.
Joyce’s jaAV set hard. “Here, boy,” he said.
“Take the wheel, and keep her just as she
is.”
Mrs. Joyce’s eyes glinted, and her breath-
ing quickened. She saw there was going to
be a fight about her, and all her primal in-
stincts awoke. For the time being she was
paheolithie.
Sigurdsen understood and braced himself.
“I don’d vant no poy to sdeer yor me,” he
said sullenly, and he still had hold of the
spokes when the other, with a sudden
upward right hand jolt, caught him under
the jaw and laid him on his back behind the
Avheel. Then Joyce stepped out of dis-
tance and threAV off his coat and waistcoat,
while the wheel Avas grabbed by the Boy,
delighted that he didn’t have to stand Avith
his back to the fun.
The Norwegian scrambled to his feet and
“peeled” in orthodox fashion; but Joyce
knew more about the game, and as Sigurd-
sen rushed in like a tornado he took a
straight left that sent him staggering against
the mizzen. Back again in a moment, he let
go tremendously for the body, but the Irish-
man—springing back and then forward in
the same instant —swung a right to the
other’s jaw that put him promptly “down
and out.”
But here Avere no Queensberry rules. For
a full minute the Norwegian lay where he
had fallen. Then he sat up, apparently still
dazed, but swiftly forming a plan. “Dod
auis all righd,” he said, as lie slowly got to
his feet. “Dyou vas too goot vor me !”
With a short laugh of contempt Joyce
turned away to take the Avheel again, and in
an instant Sigurdsen was upon him from
behind —got a mighty grip around the arms
and body, and made his teeth meet in the
Irishman’s mahogany-colored neck.
“S —s —s !” hissed the woman. Her own
teeth were clenched, her eyes were like
bayonets, and her fingers fiercely clawed the
air. The fundamental savage in her was
all awake, and that ferocious bite Avas Avliat
she would herself have inflicted upon a foe.
Then, Joyce, unable 1 to Avrench his arms
free, threw suddenly all his Aveight behind
him, so as to knock his antagonist over back-
Avards. Down then they went together; but,
as they fell, the craft’s low rail caught their
legs, and in an instant the sea had them.
The noAV badly-scared Boy had the making
of a seaman in him. As he whirled the
Avheel over to get the helm hard-doAvn he
screeched to the Avoman to run forward and
let-fly the head-sheets. This was Sanscrit
to her, and the Boy himself rushed quaver-
ing half-way to the bows; then, as the helm
righted itself and the craft fell-off again, he
darted back to the wheel. But the Roxana
was at best a lazy lump in stays. The jib
held her off, and the Boy, glancing over his
shoulder, saw the two men only just relaxing
their grip, and beginning to follow the ketch.
But they were already sixty yards or so from
her quarter, and she was moving faster now
than they could swim.
Frantically the Boy shouted to the woman
to come and take the wheel while he ran
forward to slack-off the head-sheets. But
she heeded him not. She had reacted into
modernity and hysteria. But not for long.
A sudden thought seemed to strike her like
a blow; then, Avith lips drawn back from
her clenched teeth, and red hair flying
fiercely from its coils, she rushed so savagely
towards the wheel that the frightened Boy
bolted for the main-rigging. But the woman,
with a swifter hand, grabbed him by the
collar and shook him till his teeth rattled.
“Do what 1 tell you !” she shrilled—“or over
you go to join the others! Or—better still”
—she snatched the slieath-knife Avhich the
Boy, in precocious sailorhood, wore at his
back. “I want the ship to go that way”—
she pointed down-wind, away from the men.
“Make her do it —do you hear? Make her
do it at once, or”
She flashed the knife at him, and, quaking
to his boots, the once audacious Boy put the
helm up. “Please hold the Avheel as it is,
then, ma’am,” he stammered, “an’ I'll do the
rest.” Tremulously then he went forward,
eased the jib and fore-sheets, and slacked the
main-boom well out. Then he came aft,
tended the mizzen-sheet, took the Avheel and
steadied the helm. The woman could see for
herself that her orders had been carried out,
for the Roxana, now dead before the freshen-
ing easterly breeze, was walking away eight
knots through the fast-falling night. And,
Avlien down the Avind came despairing cries,
growing gradually fainter and fainter, the
Boy shuddered, but said nothing, and the
Avoman’s face remained as stone.
“Well, you see,” said the Boy to me (the
boy grown-up and six feet high), “Avitli
nightfall it come down as thick as pea-soup,
an’ I was that flummoxed Avitli that orfui
Avoman that I clean forgot Are Avasn’t
showin’ any lights; so I nearly jumped outer
me skin Avhen I heard the screech of a
steamer’s siren close handy. I dropped the
Avheel an’ scooted for’ard, but I couldn’t see
ten yards ahead. Then the siren comes
boomin’ out again—right overhead, seemin’ly
—an’ all of a sudden I catches the loom of
a big steamer close on to us. Course I hol-
lered for ail I was worth, but, as I could see
both her side-lights, I kneAV Ave aa t us dead in
her track, an’ nex’ moment she simply Avalks
over us. I got a bash on the nut from some-
thin’, an’ I Avas dead to the world till I foun’
meself aboard the chap that had smashed us
up.”
The Boy struck a match and eclipsed him-
self Avith vapor.
“Well?” I said, after vainly waiting for
more. “What about the others? Were the
tAvo men drowned?”
“Y’may take it at that. Never heard of
again, ’t all events.”
“And the Avoman?”
Another long pause. Then —“Kuoav the
Binnacle Hotel?”
I kneAV it; and on the moment a light
came to me. The landlady of the Binnacle
Avas redundant, rufous, resnlendent and re-
pellent. Just the sort of Avoman, in fact, to
—but, stay ...
“Look here, my lad; if what you’ve told
me is true, she's a mur” ——•
“Sh —sh!” The Boy took his pipe out
from his mouth and turned upon me a
cryptic eye. “S’pose y’think she’d be afraid
of me givin’ her away?”
I nodded.
“Not ’er! She’s gone to wind’ard of me
there, all right.”
I Avaited. There was .something in all this
that didn’t quite
“She’s been puttin’ it all about that I’m
dotty—been’s mad’s a hatter ever .since

“Since that” • ■
“That bash on the ’ead !”

And I —having somewhat dramatised Avhat
the Boy told me—have since been wondering
whether or not “that bash on the ’ead” was
responsible for some of the story.

Knocked off to receive a deputation about
Aziz Rahman, the bhandary (fireman’s
cook) again.
Tn Melbourne it was discovered that the
bhandary had been drawing full rations, giv-
ing short commons to the men, and selling
the balance of the rice, etc. A good scheme,
but he was fool enough to be found out.
Well. I cursed him and reprimanded him and
let him off. Whereupon Aziz Rahman made
up his mind that he would get even with the
blighters who had told me about his ways.
He started to do it by serving up curry they
couldn’t eat, and mouldy rice to help it
down. Hence the deputation.
The donkeyman and a fireman headed it.
Aziz Rahman had to be sent for. Curry
and rice were held under my nose in kero-
sene tins, in paint-tin lids, in half-cocoanut
shells and in grimy paws, and I was urged
to taste it. But I thought not. Then the
fireman made a speech. Lightly but grace-
fully he alluded to my world-wide reputation
for wisdom and justice. He told me I was
his “father and mother” (don’t you believe
it), that he/was my unworthy slave, and
that Aziz Brahman was a jackal and his
mother an owl; also that his female rela-
tions were busy members of the oldest pro-
fession in -tiie world. The donkeyman then
made a few remarks to the same effect; but

DANGER!
Backache, Rheumatic
Weakness —and
Twinges, Urinary Troubles, Gravel point to Kidney
may lead to serious complications if neglected.
For the overworked house-
wife and tired-out man Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a
blessing. They quickly heal
and regulate the Kidneys,
helping them to filter from
the blood the poisons and
impurities which all too often
cause disease. I heir good
effect is often felt immediately,
and a fresh and invigorated
action of the kidneys brings
back to men and women the
strength their work demands.
Doan’s Pills do not act on
the bowels. They do one
thing—they cleanse and heal
the kidneys, and they do that
well. I hey are equally good
for men and women, and a
safe medicine for children.

SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
15 YEARS CURED.
Mr. William Carroll, senr., ex-railway guard, 749
Harris Street. Pyrmont, says:—“Some time ago I
strained myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon
noticed the effect in the small of my back. For three
solid months 1 was unable to work. 1 was laid up.
T had a very lame back and a dull pain through the
loins and the kidneys, and my secretions became
unnatural and irregular. I consulted a doctor, who
recommended Turkish baths, but though I got a little
ease I could not work. I used Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills, and obtained wonderful relief. I am
so much better I can now do heavy work. I am
firmly convinced that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are a true kidney remedy, and I never fail to recom-
mend them among my friends.”
Fifteen years later Mr. Carroll confirms the above:
“I have been quite free of backache and urinary
trouble ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
nie fifteen years ago. My cure proves that Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills are a thoroughly good remedy.”
SIX MONTHS CURED.
Mrs. Clias. Clift. 38 Wellington Street, Waterloo,
Sydney, says:—"ln common with many others, I
have nothing but good to say of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. This remedy cured me of a had attack
of kidney trouble of long standing some six months
ago, and I have had no return since. Before T took
these pills I was suffering a lot with my back, the
pain at times being almost unbearable. I could not
stoop or move freely, and always felt tired and had
no energy. The secretions were affected, being thick
and cloudy, with a red sediment, and I had dropsical
swellings on my legs and ankles. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were one dav brought under my notice.'
and I sent for a bottle. They gave me relief almost
at once, so I persevered with the remedy until I was
quite cured, using in all four bottles. 1 cannot speak
too highly of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and
recommend them with every confidence to other
sufferers.”

And knowing nothing when the slaying’s

A war without a “God" can never be!
Without that name no thief can square his
sin :
His sin with self, and call self “Deity”—
The sneak, the murderers who with blood-
lusts win,
Pirates by Right Divine of Piracy;
And they, like craven David, that: begin
To steal a soldier’s wife, as Scripture saith.
And give the word that easts the man for
death.
Dead soldier who shall miss the joys of life.
The glistening bridal, and the " pomp of
gold ;
His ears a-dnlled by war-drum and the fife,
To all the things his dear affections hold—
Dread! labor! and the evening and the
wife —
That, by the war he did not make, are sold ;
He thinks not of a child’s small fingers, lest
He see the vision of a nursing breast.
Christ thought He saved the world by sacri-
fice
Of blood; and smaller Christs saved it
again.
When for His vesture legions threw the dice.
And Calvary east shadows on the plain.
Men wished them true —the kindly, happy lies
That now the tortured earth was free of
pain :
But many Christs the world, since Noah's
flood,
Has known to come in war and cleanse in
blood.
Flesh is but flesh, of man-God or of man.'
The nameless Christs that die to cleanse
the world
Know not the order, method, nor the plan
That to the eager trench of death has
hurled
Brother and brother since the world began.
Or since the first barbarian's flag un-
furled.
Our Herod and our l’ilate are but one—
The self-drunk king who owns the heaviest
gun.
A hundred years of order, self-control.
Fluxed in war’s crucible of molten hate ;
Christ! Moses! Biuldli! Genius from pole
to pole:
Plato! Beethoven ! Shakspeare! All the
great
Obscured by shadows that some puppet-soul
Makes till the melting-pot's grey fumes
abate:
Given to the grave the sculptors, painters,
too:
While man-made gods laugh down the cen-
tral blue.

Hear girl, who hast tln* senses of the spring.
Who gra vest that October winds shall blow
Peach and pear blossom down to earth,
and fling
The fading flowers of the acacia low:
War hath its use, like any cleansing thing.
_ And all the meaner things of life shall go:
The fatted ease of all the hypocrites;
The smug content of all the huckstering cits.
Only shall live the great Bealities !
All royal charlatans shall disappear,
And literature arise, to truly seize
A world regenerated front the sere.
All the dead creeds in lumber-rooms at ease.
To wait their time when war again is here :
And some new king, to burn a new Louvain.
Invents a God of Battles once again!
Sweet, hate thou war because all youth is
clean.
And men are evil; greed has leached their
blood ;
Out of this lull the world shall rise serene.
Cant of all kings drowned in the battle
flood;
Prince pimp, and clay-brained king, and
dullard queen
Crackle to ashes in the furnace red;
And Demos rise, splendid in his new youth !
A child who’s lost the lie and found the
truth !
