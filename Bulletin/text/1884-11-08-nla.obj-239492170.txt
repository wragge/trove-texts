Those Horrid Scotch!
The London Daily Telegbaph is the pro-
perty of an apostate Jew, who is ashamed of
his name and is as obsequious a crawler and
trimmer as the world has ever produced. He
wishes to be reckoned an aristocrat,and seems
to conceive that, by doing the dirty work of
the class, he will qualify for admission within
it. In a recent issue of the Daily Tele-
graph, that journal, while offering the
ferocious advice which the Toady is ever so
ready with, gives a glimpse of a condition
of matters in Scotland, which, as a rule, it
has been the business of the capitalist press
of Great Btitain to deny or conceal. The
fact is that in both England and Scotland
the growth of democratic principles has been
of late so rapid and so formidable that the
propertied oligarchy which has so long
ruled Great Britain can no longer afford to
be indifferent or scornful. For generations
the people—the masses—in Great Britain
have been serfs lulled into submission by
fine phrases dealt out by the masters of the
soil and Dy the willing tools of these masters
—the State clergy. At all times there have
been protestations, and sometimes at-
tempted revolts when the pressure upon
them or that section of the people became
unendurable. But the oligarchy could
afford to smile at resistance which was obvi-
ously impotent, and have constantly taken
credit for their indifference, by pretending
that it was a virtue —love of the principles
of liberty. The farce of men who denied
the franchise to nine out of every ten
Englishmen pretending ;to love liberty
is seen, when investigated, to be un-
speakably cynical. It has never needed
more than a serious danger to oligarchi-
cal privilege for the hollowness of the
professions of devotion to Liberty to be
exposed. English artizans sabred at Peter-
loo, the Irish nation placed under martial
law, and Great Britain the only country in
the world where, by law —recent laws, re-
pugnant to the spirit of the constitution,
and passed in a scare—political offenders are
openly treated as felons; these facts expose
the thinness of the veneer. So long as de-
mocratic agitation against the plunder of
the earth-tillers by landlords was confined
to Ireland, it was comparatively easy to
persuade Englishmen and Scotchmen that
the cause of the discontent lay, not in the
social Iniquities which drove the wretched
people to desperation, but in the innate
savagery and natural perversity of Papist
Irish. Now, however, that an agitation,
identical in its causes and in its purpose, has
come to a head in the Isle of Skye, is spread-
ing rapidly throughout the Scottish High-
lands, has independently sprung up among
the Lancashire farmers, and extends to
other English counties, the reality of the
reasons at first denied can no longer be con-
cealed.
* ♦ *
The admissions made by the London
Daily Telegraph are especially note-
worthy, in view of the strong pro-landlord
deductions, presently to be referred to, of
that paper. “ Ireland for the Irish ” is a cry
which, in the ears of even Radical English-
men, has sounded very like a declaration of
a raf; ial war. We detest such cries, prefer-
ring infinitely the ideal of the International,
a nd the sentiment of “ the land for
the people. - ’ But, among the vulgar,
national sentiment is strong; and in
a *i popular agitations the need for a
concrete motto, which shall touch a chord
ominant in every heart, is felt. The true-
aita °t the Scotch, as of the Irish, is unques
tionably the right to retain enough of the
fruits of their own labour to enable them to
lire decently. In order to attain this, access
to the soil of their country is imperatively
necessary. And this is not only true with
respect to the lush and the Scotch; it is
universally true.
• • •
Now, mark the statements and admissions
of the London Daily Telegraph
‘“The Highlands for the Highlanders!’ is the
new political war-cry In Scotland, and. like the
‘slogan’ of their ancestors, it will find an echo
even in the South. For the Highlander is a popu-
lar and picturesque figure in the imaginations of
most Englishmen.”
Then, after a dissertation on the military ex-
ploits of this people while wearing British
uniform, the London paper continues: —
“ The Highlanders were first-rate soldiers all
round, and Wellington never led better men.
The steadfast patience that marked them in camp
they have also shown at home. They have suffered
evictions which compelled something like the exo-
dus of a nation; but they have submitted to the
law, taking to Canada, to England, or into Glasgow
or Dundee regret for their lost homes, yet no such
feelings of bitter resentment as have turned Irish'
peasants all into agitators, and some into assassins
We are told now that this patience is at an end;
that, at the next election, crofters’ rights will come,
to the front; and that the people will in future re-
sist the execution of the law. The recent Ross
and Cromarty election certainly showed that the
new element in Scottish politics is making itself
heard.”
This description of the condition of the
political atmosphere in the Highlands is cor-
roborated by Mr. J. A. Camekon, who writes
from the landlords’ point of view. In an
article in the Nineteenth Century, Mr.
Cameron states
“So far as disputes affecting land are concerned,
public law and authority do not exist in Skye.
The sheriff's officers, for instance, have written
formally to say that they decline to serve further
summonses upon the crofter population unless
supported by troops. Unarmed police, they aver,
would be useless, and from the executive officials
of the country I learn that the number of toldleis
they ask for as necessary to re-establish public
authority in Skye is four hundred. . . Over
half-a-dozsn cases of undoubted deforcement and
assault committed upon officers of the Crown
while in the execution of their duty, have been
allowed to remain unpunished, and although duly
reported to the central Government, the necessary
permission to prosecute on behalf of the Crown
has not been accorded. The inability of the local
authorities to effect the arrest of the offenders is
known, but the Government apparently shrink
from sanctioning the employment of troops.”
There is no doubt that the Government
has shrunk from “sanctioning the employ-
ment of troops” to do the bashi-bazouk
business upon the persons and dwellings of
Scotchmen, The example set in Ireland
could not be conveniently followed in Scot-
land. There has always been a feeling of
national antagonism and separation between
the Anglo-Scotch people and the Irish. There
has been equally a religious and an econo-
mical feud. To the most ignorant class even
of English and Scotch—the mere agricul-
tural hinds—the poor, bare-footed, ragged
Irish harvest hand has, within our own
memory, been what Chinese immigrants
are to the handicraftsmen of Australia
and of California. They were cheap compe-
titors. We can remember the “Keelies”
(Scotch equivalent for “ larrikins ”) of Mid-
lothian jeering the “IrishPaddies” as they
passed. And in Yorkshire we know the
labourer equally regarded them with min-
gled contempt and dislike. Then the differ-
ence of religions assisted to maintain an
alienation between the Irish and the British.
Any Government could, considering the
influence of these feelings, pour troops into
Ireland and suspend the Constitution there,
disguising the fact that it was an agrarian
agitation—the throes of an exploited and
plundered plebs—that was being throttled,
under pretence that violence and tyranny
had been rendered necessary by the national
intraotibility of the people as Irishmen and
their perversity as Papists. For the latter
view, the support of every Little Bethel, and
for the matter of that, every big Bethel, in
Great Britain could be securely counted on.
Australian newspaper readers, who have
noted the persistent malignity with which
the clerical S. M. Herald, under its Metho-
dist conductors, fought the landlord’s battle
and put the worst construction on every act
or argument of the struggling Irish, will
comprehend how reliable that sort of sup-
port has been. The British oligarchy might
have trampled the life out of Ireland, might
have flung her entire Papist population out
upon the highways to [shiver and perish in
the wintry rains, while soldiers and process-
servers warmed themselves at blazing ham-
lets ; might have, m that part of the Empire,
practiced the experiment how to over-ride
the Constitution—in Englapd, if convenient,
later on; and such papers as the S. M-
Herald, every Methodist Conventicle, and
every Orange Lodge would have kept up an
unfaltering chorus of approbation.
• * •
But when it comes to turning loose troops
upon Scotchmen and Presbyterians, the
matter is different. There would be an
“echo in the South," truly. The lowland
Scotch, with their traditions secular and re-
ligious, from Bannockburn to Drumclog,
would not with indifference see the scarlet
uniforms harrying “pujr folk” on the hill-
sides. In the Highlands, the clans, broken
as they are, would hear the spirits of their
ancestors crying vengeance from among the
mists did any Minister dare to revive, even
by a distant resemblance, the memories of
Glencoe, and of those weary months when,
after Culloden, it was better to be a wild
beast than a Highlander, Aye, and the
people of England would murmur and
heave. The 6fcot is not to the quiescent
Englishman the objectionable person the
Irishman is, but a brother. The Bethels,
little and great, would change their tune
when it was Presbyterian, not “ Papist,”
that was put under military execution.
• * *
We don’t believe that, even were the de-
sired 400 soldiers sent to enforce the land-
lords’ exactions in Vist, the people of any
part of the United Kingdom would rise in
revolt, or that the incident would kindle a
civil war. But we do belies e that the troops
for the function would need to be very care-
fully selected, lest they refused, at the
critical moment, to assault their fellow-
countrymen. Doubtless, the army contains
a sufficient quantum of ignorant black-
guards who would be insensible to the
character of the duty. But if Highland regi-
ments yet preserve any vestige of their
original character, they could not be trusted
to do such dirty work. For obvious rea-
sons, Irish regiments would also be unsafe.
And although there may be English bat-
talions, recruited in St. Giles and Seven Dials,
which would do all they were wanted to do
and ask no questions, the employment of
such in Scottish territory would tend to a
national exasperation of the most serious
kind. Still, there would bo ho immediate
civil war. But if 400 troops wer® sent to
Yist, we .believe the. advertisement of the

crofters’ grievance would be so effectual, and
the resultant perturbation throughout the
Highlands so wide-spread, that 4000 men
would be immediately afterwards required
to deal with crofters all over the Northern
Counties. Even that, however, could be got
over. The truly serious result would, to our
mind, be that the incident, should it ever
occur, will set the people of England a-think-
ing, and thinking free from the prejudices
which, when Ireland was the scene, clouded
and perverted their judgment and apprecia-
tion of the real questions demanding solu-
tion. And the day that the English people
commence to think out the agrarian pro-
blem in good earnest will mark the serious
commencement of a radical change in the
distribution of land, and in other social con-
ditions which have as yet occupied the re-
flections of only the most intelligent mem-
bers of the proletariat.
• • •
The Daily Telegbaph, however, does not
comprehend the matter in this way. It sees
in the condition of affairs in the Highlands
merely a chance for the Tories to “dish
the Whigs.” It quotes Mr. Cameron when
he says
“The Whigs have never done much for the
Highlands. It was Whig doctrinaires who de-
fended and Whig landlords principally who carried
out the clearances, while the leading Whig news-
paper of the South of Scotland is even now our
most inveterate enemy. Is it possible the Tories
may come to our assistance ? Let them put for-
ward candidates for the northern counties, and
let the party be pledged to bring in a suitable
Crofters’ Relief Dili, and we will guarantee them
the capture of all the existing Whig seats in the
North of Scotland I”
As a preventive against such a misfortune
to the Whig party, the London journalist
coolly suggests a further development of
the policy of expatriation which has already
partially depopulated the Highlands. He
asks :—
“Do the crofters and their friends desire to see
an Ireland in the North ? When they root a poor
peasantry in an impoverished soil, will the next
generation bo as well off as the Scotchmen who,
after eviction, came South, or crossed the seas
to build up thriving homes far from their native
glens ?”
This remark about an “impoverished soil ”
reads very peculiarly when placed side by
side with the following passage from the
Crofters’ Manifesto
“The Highland Crofters are poor peasants, cul-
tivating small plots of land in the north of Scotland
and in the Islands thereabouts. Many of us are
threatened with eviction because we cannot pay
our rents In full. Wo cannot pay, as we have been
rack-rented for generations, and thus prevented
from accumulating savings and capital. We have
been gradually deprived of the use of peat and turf
fqr fuel; heather, rushes, ferns, and stone for building
purposes and for repairs of our huts; seaweeds for
manure; and for our beasts. All these, we
crofters had looked on from time immemorial as
our rlghtslln common. No one interfered with us
in the old days; but, as land became more valuable
the landlords laid claim to all these things. Our
fathers were too shamefaced to go to court; and
where could paupers like us crofters get money to
defend our rights ? And without money who can
get justice ? . . . Besides the sufferings we
have already told youj.of, we suffer greatly as
we have been driven from our fertile lands and
made to settle,'on barren soils, as rich farmers
wanted the good soils and the sheltered sites for
their south country sheep.”
But the conclusion of the Daily Telegraph’s
article puts the crown of effrontery upon tho
brazen front of its monopolist reasonings
"‘Justice to tho crofters’ is admirable in spirit,
but to fix them in the soil, and turn their thoughts
away from the emigration which has scattered
thriving Scotchmen all over the world, would be a
lamentable mistake. The true way for a Scot to
combine patriotism with prudence is toTleave his
native country when young, and in old age to
return to it rich.
That is to say, the landlords consider that a
Scotchman has no right to live in Scotland,
but may be graciously permitted to die there.
He may not occupy enough land for a cot
and oat-patch, but he will, if he goes to
Jericho and stays there till he feels the hand
of death upon him, be conceded enough land
for a grave.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Positively Last Farewell.
Sib Henry Parkes’ third positively Anal retire-
ment from public life is of the same pattern with
his two former last appearances. On each occasion
he had been put into the shade and kept there till
his patience and his hopes had alike evaporated.
But he has hitherto always come back. Whether
be will again step upon the political stage wil*, pro-
bably, as before, depend upon circumstances, and
especially Sir Henry Parkes’ circumstances. His
positive farewell is, of course, of no value. The
public has had experience of the value of two of
these Parkesian promissory notes, before. No man
can say with what private mark the farewell ad.
dress may be Inscribed, or what reservation that
mark may signify to those in the secret. It is but
natural that Sir Henry, reduced by the coldness
of the public to act as a supernumerary on
the stage where formerly he was a leading
actor, should issue a maledictory rather than
a valedictory address. We can quite under-
stand that he really believes much of his evil fore-
cast. We are ourselves uneasy respecting the
very matters he i efers to. The lavish increases in
the salaries and pensions of the Judges, to such a
point that pur Chief Justice is as highly paid as the
Chief Justice of the United States with its fifty
million inhabitants, we protested against when
proposed. We shark Sir Henry’s uneasiness
about the effects of the Band Dili, and are no ipprp
happy than be with respect to the style in which
railways are authorised to be i cattered as from a
pepper-castor over the country. But how Sir
Henby Pabkes ventures to plfty the critic is what
confounds Us. To whom, If not tb himself and
his dear friend (since interests corresponded), Sir
John Robebtson, is due the chaotic condition of
the land laws which has rendered their reformation
so difficult and so complicated a task that honesty of
purpose may not have been adequate, without
special and extraordinary ability, to restore order
in that department of administration? And who
is to be blamed if, inthe absence of an intelligent
and respectable Opposition, Ministerial schemes
have been passed into law without proper sifting
out ? Sir Henby Pabkes claims to be anjable man-
Nay, he is an able man. Could not he, for one
short year, have served his country, without place
or pay or “ consideration ?” Is he such a dog—this
self-styled patriot—that he will not watch unless
he has a bone? Nay, there are no such dogs. Sir
Henby slinks into private life mouthing impotent
malice like a spiteful crone.
Crooks and Crookedness.
A Bishop is generally pictured with a crook in his
hand—that icing an appropriate implement for
catching a sheep by the log, and hauling him Just
where he does not wish to go. In the Dissenting
churches, the President is a Bishop. In New
South W lies, at present, the.leading crookists are
Bishops Barry and Moran, and Mr. Jeffbrxs,
and, if we consider the public as pretty
well what it is—a sheep—we have the exhilarating
spectacle of a sheep, hooked by three legs, and
being dragged from three directions at once,
witu considerable difficulties for the remaining
leg to deal with. Barry wants religion taught in
one way, Jeffbrxs in another, and Moran lu
another. This three-cornered euchre takes the
form of all-round charges of bluff—or “ inconsis-
tency,” as the clerics put it. Meantime, the un-
crooked leg, which is the outside public, bears the
weight. Dropping the one-legged metaphor, the
plain English about this religious question is, that
the public are beginning to’cry “a plague of all
your houses.” Let the children be taught abbut
light, and health, and truth, and provable facts,
and let your crooks go to the marine store, for all
the common-sense Australians care.
Exeunt Omnes.
Since the Land Bill got the Vice-Regal assent,
Nunc dimittus has been the unspoken prayer of
every member of the Assembly. The railway ap-
propriation aroused the spasmodic interest of the
House, but the debate was a farce. It was simply
the old game at grab, squared by the inevitable
log-rolling—“ You vote for my line, and I’ll vote
for yours.” Nobody believes that the merits of
the various lines authorised have been logically
and conscientiously discussed, but everybody
knows that public money has to be spent pro-
fusely to keep the people in bread and lodging.
The census taken three years ago showed plainly
that only a fraction of the population was sup-
ported by productive industry. Most of the
people lived in the towns, and a large portion of
both town and country residents subsisted oo/Go-
vernment money. If it was so in 1881, it is oven
moreithe fact now; so whether the railways of
the future run empty trains or not, the money has
got to be spent. The Civil Service Bill and the
Confederation would have been much
better postponed. No good work can be expected
from an Assembly fagged by thirteen montht>
sitting. It is lucky that, by the bare majority
of one vote, we are saved from being
handed over, bound hand and foot, to a
Federal Council. Whatever may be the results
which may accrue from the labours of the past
session, the legislation attempted has been enor-
mous; and it would be unjust to question the
good faith of the Assembly in tackling the recon-
struction of our land-system. Yet the Act is not
what it should be. The most that can bo said is
that the Policy of 1861 is abolished, and that the
lines of a better system have been laid; but it will
be long before the arrears of the ola Act are dis-
posed of and the inheritance of intrigue,discord,and
waste Is purged from our records. For the present,
and probably till some amending Act is passed, the
discord between squatter and selector will continue
with greater fury than ever. The Morhis-Kankkn
report published in May, 1883, first disclosed the
real condition of the public lands; but Mr. Faun ell,
with incredible apathy or stupidity,entirely ignored
the revelations contained in the report, and drew
his Bill as if he had a clean sheet of.'paper before
him. Consequently, as no precaution has been
taken to preserve the lands for the proposed settle-
ment, “ peacocking ” on a greater scale than ever
has gone on for the last eighteen months; and when
the stations arc divided, each “ resumed area” will
present the appearance of a veritable “ Chinese
puzzle.” The simple, honest yeoman who goes to
a Lands Office to apply for a farm will find himself
double-banked by agrarian blacklegs of all sorts
and conditions, from the “ Honorable ” of the
Upper House to the wood-and-water Joey who
dummies at£5 the job, or the Melbourne magsfiian
who demands his £50.
Still, it is not to be forgotten that we are making
a fresh start, and it is not to be assumed that alj
the new forces brought into play will be on the side
of fraud or corruption. The local administration
by Land Boards is a newfeature altogether in New
South Wales, and in this much interest centres.
The value of these Boards will depend altogether
on the Chairmen appointed. In most cases, the
members of the Board will be dummies or cyphers
—partisans in small local jobs, and ignorant and
careless as to matters of general Import. But the
Chairman will be necessarily the brain and right
hand of the Board. He will be precisely in the
same position as the Queensland Commissioners
who have presided in the Land Courts of that
colony for the last sixteen years. If men of the
right stamp are appointed, we have every prospect
of seeing a new page opened up in administration,
in spite of the defective laws; and every step in
the direction of decentralisation and intelligent
executive action is to be welcomed as a boon.
Various panics are mentioned in connection with
these appoinments ; some of politicians, much
better on the stump than in any honourable and
responsible position; some notorious in connection
with profitable dealings in appraisements; a nin-
compoop or two; but among others, two names
§tapd out prominently. if the one
connected with the Department of Mines and the
other a member of the Survey Staff, accept the
positions of Chairmen, the districts they are ap-
pointed to will be well administered,
The Lands Department staff is said to be engaged
in framing the regulations for the working of the
Act. It is possible that these may in certain
cases, where the Ministerial discretion has scope,
remove ambiguities, but those who are studying
the Act see little chance of the latv’s working
smoothly. The impromptu verbal amendments
carried in committee, by members half asleep,
often entail infinite mischief and huge, expense on
the community.

they are called “Civil servants,” but this is a mere

hend your argument. You think it would be as

totle as jthiat of “ The Fruits of Philosophy,” and
you illustr ate your position by the parallel case of
the use and abuse of tne Juice of the grape. God
gave you powers of speech, reason, and free-will,
whereby you are distinguished from the brute
creation; and, having thus endowed you, He set
before you good and evil to choose between. Else
where was the use of free-will ? Thus you had the

struction or read for erotic gratification. But to
prohibit their publication would, you argue, be as
senselesu as to eradicate the vine. Good. We
agree. But we do hold that in the present
stage of human progress towards enlightenment,
the sale alike of liquors capable of intoxicating
'’and books capable of inflaming need to be regu-
lated. Our plan would be to make the sale of
either to legal “infants,” or even the lending to
juveniles, an offence. Possibly it would be well
even to require dealers in such works to take out
a license, so that supervision might be exercised.
But, to prohibit them, is a recourse to Philis-
tine bigotry drivelling at the moqtU.

Some years ago, when
the frisky and genial Gar-
net Walch had just
written a neat thing in
verse, entitled “A Drug
in the Market,” the atra-
bilious and funereal, but
withal learned and able,
David Blair (he used to
be a Presbyterian clergy-
man), who read it, said
it was indeed capital, and
would bo absolutely per-
fect if he (David) were
.•illowed to make in it a
few alterations. When
Garnet was told this, he
sat down and wrote: “ My
dear Mr. Blair, I send you
MS. of the set of verses
shown you the other day
by . Will you add
another to the many
favours you have already
conferred on me by
touching it up a little,
and greatly oblige your
talented friend. Garnet
WAi.cn.” Whereupon
David—who, by the way,
is now editor of the Mel-
bourne World -pro-
ceeded to “alter” Gar-
net’s poem with a ven-
geance, by striking out
all the humour, and
substituting sundry grim
Calviuistic jokes for the
quips which were to make
all Melbourne laugh. Gar-
net didn’t publish the
poem as altered by David.
He is keeping it, he says,
until his gloomy friend

The other day the
Intelligence was cabled
to Australia that certain
men and two women had
been executed at St.
Petersburg on account of
the part they took in one
of the innumerable plots
always afoot to wipe out
the Czar. So many “men”
and “two women ” count
for nothing. They are
arithmetical units when
so referred to. But these
poor creatures, had they
been born in Australia,
would probably have
been now alive, active,
good citizens, of more
than average energy, and
willing to make sacrifices
tor the public good. And
the “women”—God help
them!—might have been
matronly mothers of
romping children, enjoy-
ing day by day the peace-
ful delights of observing
their girls and boys grow
and develop under their
eyes. One of these “ wo-
men” was Natalie Fey-
gbine. At the time of her
execution she was 36 years
of age. Her whole life
had been devoted to her
country. While yet a
girl of 17, she took part
in the movement of 1873,
and,after trial with others
before a special commis-
sion, was sent to Siberia.
Two years ago she es-
caped, and arrived at St.
Petersburg after a journ-
ey on foot of eighteen
months, undergoing the
severest privations and in
perpetual fear of recap-
ture. With recovered
health she entered anew
into the Nihilist conspir-
acy, and was recently
arrested, with a number
of others, accused of
plotting against the life
of the Czar. Now she is
dead. The Czar was fright-
ened of her. Long may
he live—the life of a cur.

“Lord Northbrook had, to-day, another

teem” such a low, cowardly, besotted, sensuous
ruffian as the Khedive.

One Andrew Carnegie, a New York mil-
i lionaire, has been driving all through England in a

bably the most respectable woman that ever oecu-

There is one question you can’t safely ask

Madame Kolemine, the troublesome “ mor-
ganatic” wife of the Grand Duke of Hesse, is
beautiful, clever, and unscrupulous. She threatens
to disclose many delicate matters relating not only
to her husband’s family, but also to his English
relatives, and the equivocal manner in which she
was originally brought to consent to a divorce is
to be divulged. The Grand Duke, who threatened
to shoot himself if the marriage were stopped, is,
now, perhaps, almost ready to do so because it
cannot be quietly quashed. Queen Victoria
has taken an active part in the affair: and,
although furiously angry, has been willing to
spend money freely in order to arrange it.
Mrs. Kenealy, widow of Orton’s counsel,
is treasurer of the “ Claimant’s Demonstration
Committee.” Apropos, young Kenealy, son of the
deceased barrister, some time ago started in Lon-
don a paper palled Modern Society, in which he
1 lost his interest, mainly through lack of funds to
carry on the venture, which in other hands is now
a financial success. The “Claimant’s” friends
mean to carry things with a high hand. Mr. Ed-
mund Kimber says:—“Not only will Sir Roger
Tichborae on his release seek the very earliest op-
| fiortunity of again swearing that he is Sir Roger
Tichborae, but he will bring an action for libel
agalnit any newspaper who ventures to call him
an imposter, and in that action he will conclusively
prove that he has been tho victim at as foul a con-
spiracy as ever disgraced any civilised country.”
The Dublin paper, United Ireland, in
reference to the visit of Alf—not our Alf., the
royal Alfred—works up steam in this fashion:—“ So
long as the Eaglish Parliament chooses to continue
the Sovereign in her situation, we, although hold-
ing our own opinion that hereditary Sovereigns
are as laughable shams as hereditary peers, will
continue to obey the law with respect to Royalty,
as we obey the law with respect to vaccination.
But the personal adoration of the very common-
place persons who fill thrones Is no more enjoined
by law than kissing the shoe of the policemen or
process-server when officially engaged. The Duke
of Edinburgh is not even a Sovereign, but one of
?n innumerable German family, ifhose chief claim
or the homage of the people who pay them a
million and a half a year in salaries Is that they are
not the idiots and debauchees that their grand- |
fathers were. Upon his merits as a man and a
j fiddler he would not have risen to a seat at an
Irish Board of Guardians.”
We have acquainted our readers pretty
j fully respecting the eminent merits of that
superior brand of blackguard,'the Duke of Marl-
borough—drunkard, rake-heli, and seducer of his
friend’s wife.The correspondent of a London J
j weekly writes, apropos of the Duke’s first appear-
ance after his succession to the title, in the. House
of Lords: “Sir, Sometime ago I wrote’to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, asking him to place a
notice on the House of Lords paper to this effect:
‘ That, should the Duke of Marlborough apply to
be sworn in as a Peer, he would oppose his taking
the oath and bis.seat in that House,’ as I did not
think he was a proper person to sit there, after
reading the shameful proceedings in the Divorce
Court some time back. The Archbishop’s chap-
lain wrote to say that the Archbishop of Canter-
bury said he could not prevent the Duke taking his
neat. The truth is, sir, that the Archbishop of
Canterbury did not like, 1 suppose, to offend
(Society, by saying anything against a Duke, how-
ever wicked or badly behaved, as it would be a
dreadful breach of etiquette never to be forgiven;
or, sir, why did not the whole bench of Bishops
rise and leave the Rouse during the Duke’s speech,
to show their horror and contempt for bis soefcty
in the House of Lords ?”
When the venerable Baroness Burdeit-
Coutts became the proprietor of Mr. “ Alphabet ”
Bartlett, it pleased her to alter his name to Bir->
dett, or Coutts, or something of the kind. Tlig,
mania for changing names seems to be catching
for Mr, Bartlett, or Mr. Burdett, or Mr. Coutts. tr‘
whatever his “monniker” happens to be, has iuit
been Indulging his fancy In re-christening a flebinr
smack of which ho is the nominal--and probaMj
his wife is the real—owner. Hitherto, this vessel
has been officially registered as the William Ewart
Gladstone, but henceforth, is to be known as wm.
o’-the-Wisp. This notice, which duly appears in
the London Shipping Gazette, is Bartlett’s
method of insult‘ng the veteran British statesman
who is even older than his (Bartlett’s) own wife
When Bartlett, or Burdett, or Coutts was a little
schoolboy, his model conduct in that capacity ia
understood to have first won the affections of the
lady who is now his wife. It is a pity that out o#
her unbounded wealth Baroness Coutts had not
subscribed an additional twopence a week to her
protege’s school fees, in order to nave had him
taught those manners indispensable in all aspirants
to a public career.
The present King of
Italy’s disregard of the
warnings addressed to
him as to the danger of
exposing himself to chol-
era recalls the retort of
Victor Emmanuel, when
Duke of Savoy at the
fatal fight at Novara, to
an aide-de-camp, who
pointed out that the
Duke’s cloak had been
shot through three times,
and urgently adjured him
to leave the field. “ Mind
your own business/'
quoth the son of Charles
Albert ; “I am minding
mine.” The only instance
in which King Humbert,
who inherits his father’s
pluck, felt constrained to
deviate from his obstin-
acy of purpose was when
he was about to plunge
into the depths of the
lowest and vilest of the
Neapolitan slums, the
Fondaci. A voice among
his following was heard
to exclaim, “You have
no right to commit sui-
cide ; neitner have you
any right deliberately to
kill many of these un-
fortunate people, who
will continue to follow
you into that focus and
hotbed of pestilence.” In
answer to this lemon-
strance, the King bowed,
and slowly re-entered his
carriage. However, he
wasn’t thinking of him-
self, but of those whom
etiquette would have
compelled to follow him,
and who were possibly in
a desperate state of doubt
as to whether they would
get out of the Fondaci
again with a whole skin.
At last a London
paper tells the simple un-
varnished truth about
Miss Mary Anderson :—
*’ Viewed as an actress
alone, she is rather below
than above the average
of many of the young
ladies who are at present
on the stage. There is
nothing genuine in her.
Whatever she plays, she
is exactly the same—cold,
hard, and mechanical ;
more like a marionette
than a woman of flesh and
blood. So long as Miss
Anderson has to remain
the statue girl, she is at
her best. She has care-
fully studied statuesque
attitudes', and she clicks
irom one well-known
pose into another as
though see were ani-
mated by the most per-
fect of clockwork. Here,
however, all that can be
said in her favour ends.
The stone remains stone.
The statue never comes
to life. She is unable to
portray emotions which
she docs not leel. But
when she loves and when
she hates, when she weeps
and when she smiles, she
is nothing more than a
pretty doll, utterly un-
conscious of the signifi-
cation of the words that
fall from her lips, and,
except for her beauty, as
uninteresting as she is
uninterested. M>ss Ander-
son, on the other hand,
is not likely to be more
than a pretty American
Miss, whose chief merit
is that she is good to
her mother. And, when
one goes to see JuiMi o Q
the stage, it should »• to
him a matter of the most
absolute indifference
whether she has tended
her mother with filial
devotion or entirely
broken with her, or
whether she has married
a Bishop or run away
with a groom. On the
stage,” continues Labou-
chere, “ I prefer the
naughtiest of girls who
canact, to the most per-
fect paragon who can-
not.”

has been re-published by a lot of the leading
weeklies of England and America. Latterly, copy-
ing one from the other, they lost track ot m®
origin of the poem, and knowing only that it was
Australian and striking, one paper pronounced it
the most characteristic and Australian of Kendall s

Ballarat, with a handsome landau worth 400
vuinets, and Dr. Moore has thought proper to ac-
cent it.” Well, now, wo see nothing extraordinarily
remarkable in that. In fact, if Mr. M’Loaghlin has
another landau to spare we are quite ready to fol-
low Dr. Moore’s very sensible lead, and take the
thing ourselves. Different men have different
tastes. Home of the early martyrs had a penchant
for walking with buck-shot and dried peas in their
hoots over blue-motallod roads for miles; but that
is no reason why Dr. Moore should do the same.
Besides, there were no M’Loughlins knocking
around in those days; consequently, simon Peter
never had the opportunity ot refusing the offer of
a 400-guinea landau—and it is a piece of downright
impertinence to presume that he would have been
soft enough to do so, if he had. And, again, we fail
to see why the Word comes with any greater degree
of attractive force or acceptability from a man
who has been tramping round in his bare feet
during a hot summer’s day than it does from a Turk-
ish-bath patronising, scented, and pomatumed bis-
hop lying leisurely back in his 400-guinea landau.
Our experience is all in favour ot the apostle in the
“kerridge ;” and it he carries a double-breasted
hamper in the “boot,” we feel dead sure he will
make more converts in half an hour than any
hare-footed friar in the land will make in half a
year. The time for treating poverty as a cardinal
virtue has gone by and all the sympathy it meets
with to-day is 40s. or seven days in gaol. Now,
John, bring round our landau, and we 11 give the
Potts Point belles a treat they rarely witness.
The Tichborne-Orton-Creswell excitement
Is gradually declining, but we have a letter from a
correspondent, who says he was “ well acquainted
with R. D. Tichborne before he left Melbourne and
changed his name to Thomas Castro.” Also, that
he was “well acquainted with Arthur Orton, both
in Melbourne and Wapping,” He asks us to send
him a copy of The Bulletin containing the pic-
ture of Sir W. Manning taking the evidence of the
Creswells and the Ortons, because the cut shows
the full figures and the hands of William Creswell,
and so makes it more important to him than it
otherwise would be, as Creswell “ differs from
Arthur Orton more in those points than in any
others. William Creswell is - a straight-made man,
with small hands; and Arthur Orton is far from a
ctright-made man, with very long, bony hands.
Arthur is the figure of Charles Orton, only taller
[Why, Charles Orton is a hump-back, a deformed
in an I Such a trait could never surely be forgotten
when the Claimant’s identity with Arthur Orton
was being legally sifted out at his trial.— Ed. B.]—
" with sharper features!” [Charles Orton’s features
are strongly marked, and gaunt.— B.] Our
correspondent further alleges that Arthur Orton
was last heard of in Queensland, under the name
of Brown. Also, that he, the writer, wasdn Sydney
last Christmas, and had an interview with Joseph
Bckford, Charies Orton, Daniel Smith, and William
Creswell, and was consequently in a position to
make a comparison between Orton and Creswell.
Further, he says: "The unfortunate Claimant has
been led astray ” [In identifying a portrait of Cres-
woll as the likeness of Arthur Orton?-En. B.]
“with a photo, of William Creswell, which was
taken sitting in a chair all of a Jump, making him
to appear like Arthur Orton, there being some re-
semblance in the face, but none whatever in the
figures. Orton has high, round shoulders; Cres-
well has not, but the same height.”
Mr. George Augustus Sala will he acoom-
mied to Australia by Mrs. Sala, a rather charm-
ing woman who acts as “busineFS man” for the
gening who is so fortunate as to be her husband.
Mr. tala, who has of late years quite “ reformed it
ail,” barring his temper, is a glutton at work, and
almost lives in his splendid library—a collection of
hooks which, for the practical purposes of an all-
round literary roan, is Probably unsurpassed. Mr.
Sala’s house is all books and pictures. The great
Journalist rises early, seizes the morning papers,
and at once begins to plot out, in his curiously
stiff and exact “fist,” materials for a leader or two
Pu topics of the day. By and bye, Mrs Sala takes
nur husband’s notes down to the office ot the
IDlLY Telegraph, and sees the managing editor,
wno decides upon which of the suggested subjects
bis eminent contributor is to write. Upon receiv-
ing instructions, G. A. S. soon gets through his
leader, and goes on with his other daily work,
Which includes cutting out and elaborately cross-
indexing all newspaper scraps which may there-
after be useful for purposes of references. As a
writer ot “social leaders,” Mr, Sala has no peer.
He has done little serious literary work beyond a
novel and a play or two, with which exceptions
the whole ot his writings have consisted of fugl-
4*ye “ screeds.” His idea of visiting Australia was
delved from Archibald Forbes, who, after he had
iSpi&ijl out this land of milk and honey, urged upon
(Sala to undertake a lecturing and writing tour,
E\jd recommended him to put hiraeelf In the hands
ot Mri R. S. jSmvthc. R. S. happened at the time
to a call'to London, but it is understood that
he and Mr. Sala tailed to come to terms. At first
it was announced in the London papers that G; A.
8. was under engagement to lecture for Messrs.
“Allison and Rignold,” now it appears that his
entrepreneurs are Messrs. “ Rignold and Co.” and
all London is wondering why Mr. Allison’s name
has been left out. Mr. Sala’s voice, when raised
la a large ball, becomes somewhat stridect, but he
is really a most humorous and charming speaker,
and, as an after-dinner orator, is not surpassed by
even the genial and brilliant American Minister,
James Russell Lowell.
Thus the ’Frisco Argonaut, a paper whose
“tree and Hashing” style of writing shows that its
editors are up to the time-right up;—“ Robert
Ingoraoll is causing a profound sensation among
the orthodox—all the orthodox, from the Roman
Catholic down through the Episcopalian, Metho-
dist. Baptist, and Presbyterian, and all that hold to
similar dogmas or believe in like creeds. It is im-
possible for the orthodox world to ignore this
orator of liberal thought. It is all very well to say
that fie is not original, that he is only reflecting
/oltalre and Paine: his lectur ’8 are none the les*
Interesting that he has culled them from the fields
of infidel literature, and they are none the less
convincing that his unanswerable arguments, his
oiling satire, and his pungent wit are drawn from
sources beyond himself. The fact is, that to the
•rreat, busy world his lectures are new, and even
to the student of the writings of freethought they
°ome with the interest of a novel presentation, and
Apt the less effective because they embrace the
■flews of earlier students, and perhaps abler ones,
*•0 the same line of investigation. Ingersoll has the
-Courage of most of his convictions. He has the
.-courage to say what multitudes of intelligent per-
■fin08 think. He holds up toe whole orthodox
■foHeme to a cold and merciless analysis; with pltl-
■P8s scorn and most irreverent contempt he tears
®fay its disguises, exposes its nakedness, and lets
the daylight of common sense and common reason
‘o upon the skeleton. He shows ecclesiasticism as
a framework of fraud and priestly artifice, based
on lying traditions. He does not deny the exist-
en Pe of God. To those who ask, he replies, “ I do
know.” Bat the scheme of salvation, inspira-
bOQ, predestination, miracles, masses, transub-
ff.-htiation, and the entire dogma of the Papal
he challenges, and holds up to the
light of reason. We say to the grim old
criminal of Rome, and to all the accused pilloried
5} the same dock, that they must plead to the in-
ufetmont and enter upon their defence. Colonel
Ingersoll—whether he is right or wrong—is voicing
the opinions of multitudes of Intelligent men and
women; he is reflecting tho sentiments to-day of
more adult thinking men and women in all the
civilised countries ot the world than all the ortho-
dox churches of the a orld.”
No event, perhaps, has given us so much
satisfaction, since the day when a deluded vintner
left at our residence an unbilled cask of Mackay,
as the return to this colony of Mr. Frank Bennett,
who forms, in conjunction with the captivating
Chris., the alluring Alfred, and the (now) high-
toned Henniker, the proprietory of the News and
Jehnel. Mr. Frank Bennett has long been known
and recognised (by us, especially) as a journalist
of startling promise, and at one time he was
credited, on ait, with the composition of all the
Evening News poetry not signed by either
Douglas (etc.) Sladen or Alfred Allen. This was,
doubtless, due to Prank's having been, for such a
lengthened period, so closely allied to Grease.
However that may be, with engine-cotton Frank
most frequently made his mark, and the art he ex-
hibited as machine editor was, we believe, but
rarely questioned; and then only by rival con-
ductors, who secretly envied Mr. Bennett’s deli-
cate manipulation and the degagi manner in which
he fulfilled his various literary duties. The cause
of Frank’s somewhat sudden departure was an
open secret at the time. It was said that Alfred
objected to his collaring all the concert tickets,
and never writing any notices. So Frank then
said he would write a notice, and he did—on Char-
bonnet. It commenced, it we remember rightly,
as follows;—"As a two-feeder to a double-action
planner, and for manipulation of tho near-side
cranks in the concertina effects, Alice may be said
to knock sparks out of the Hy-wheels of every
key-board crasher tbat has preceded her. During
the revolutions of the second part, the audience
were as silent as an Otto, but the moment the
steam was cut off all present roared like a man-o’-
war siren.” Alfred, however, wouldn’t insert this
critical blast. He considered there was too much
of the paregorical in it; besides, the number of
•’ meatandforks ” with which it was drownded he
could rot but consider as “abnorman.” Frank
then left disgusted, and it was rumoured that he
had even put up his “old masters” for sale—
every one of them genuine, for Mr. Bennett saw
all the pictures painted himself, and desired his
artists, in every case, not to spare the varnish as
there was lots more at the ship-chandler’s. Frankly,
we are frlad to welcome Francis once again in the
circle of our dilettante which ho so adorns. As
Mr. Turveydrop remarked, “ We are few, now.",
London Figaro, the Tory catch-penny
which gives a pen-and-ink sketch of some notable
or would-be notable man in each issue, on Aug. 23 rd
devoted three columns to our own “ Sir Salmon,
the baronetcy-hunter.” Like our own Henniker,
Sir Samuel Wilson, a parvenu, seems to have
taken to heart the lesson taught by Disraeli, no
less in the wonderful Jew’s career than in his
earliest novel, “ Vivian Grey.” That lesson is that
a social nobody has a far better chance of pushing
to the front in English public life, if he boldly at-
taches himself to the high old Tories, than if he
take his natural place among the Liberals. The
reason given is that the Liberal ranks are con-
stantly recruited by parvenus who either have
talent to force their way to distinction, or havp
made money enough to buy a position. Parmnus
naturally have, when conscious either ot great
wealth or great ability, a jealous rivalry of the
haughty pretensions and assumption of privileged
exclusivwm of the high old families. And often
the newly-made man really retains, after he is a
“ made man,” the ideas and political impressions
which were natural while he was truly one of “the
people ” Now, the great old Whig families,
which until very recently managed the Liberal
party just as they pleased, are even more
haughtily and severely exclusive in their
social relations and domestic circles than
the great Tories. They have so many politi-
cal alliances with vulgar new men, and have
to unbend so much and mix so much in public
life, that they suffer a reaction in private. They
vote on the same side, and sit on the same benches,
and even in the same Cabinet, with manufacturers
and big ex-contractors and such, so that their pri-
vate citadels—their home circles and personal con-
nections—are perpetually in a state of siege. Cense
quently, they are even more unapproachable,
socially, than Tories of the same rank, who
are not so beleagured by political associates
whom they regard as being of inferior caste. To
a Liberal magnate a rich or clever recruit more or
less, from the ranks of the vulgar, is of small im-
portance. Such volunteers are plentiful. But to
the Tories, a smart partizan or a newly-enriched
vulgarian, with a vanity proportioned to his ple-
thoric money-bags, and a perfect willingness to
bleed freely, and pay alike for social accommoda-
tions and concessions, and for the political funds
ot “The Party,” is an exceptional personage, and
one to be made much of. We never heard of Sir
Samuel Wilson pretending to cherish “ Liberal ”
sentiments. So far as we know, he has been a
Conservative as long as he had anything to con-
serve, and although he started as a mdre North of
Ireland bumpkin, early showed that he had a
practical genius for money-making, and conse-
quently. if ever he was in sympathy with the
“plebs.” from whom 1 he sprung, he was not long
in Australia before he learned to respect pro-
foundly the “ privileges of property.” On his
retiring to England with a knighthood and enor-
mous wealth, he drifted either by preference or
astute calculation, towards the Conservatives, anal
began to make hot running for a place. His mis-
take so far has been a belief altogether overween-
ing, and quite too brutally betrayed, in the abso-
lute efficacy of money to buy anything. Sir
Samuel showed his hand too plainly altogether.
He went so openly into the market, with bis big
purse obtrusively displayed, that the obliging
persons who are generally willing enough to
“procure” for a Croesus, have been positively
ashamed to do anything for Sir Samuel. Thus his
costly attempt to secure the seat for Londonderry
in the Conservative interest, his sensational pur-
chase of the late Premier's place. Hughenden, and
the big advertisements secured by magniloquent
announcements that nothing should be altered in
the house and grounds—nay, even In the very fur-
niture of Disraeli’s apartments—that is to say, the
chair would remain the same, so that perhaps peo-
ple would overlook in a degree the tact that it had
a different occupant—these have so far failed to
make Sir Samuel more than notorious, His thou-
sand pound cheque to the Helr-Apparent’s latest
fad, the Royal College of Music—his splendid fetes
— even the iucky chance ot his son at Eton being
on hand to thump with an umbrella the latest
feeble crank who tried to assassinate Her Majesty
the Queen with an unloaded pistol-have all been
equally fruitless. Sir Samuel with his purse out,
tipping noble Jeremy Diddiers who promised any-
tning ne wanted, and in a florid condition of pal-
pable readiness to tip every influential person or
body from the Heir-Apparent down to the Con-
servative Election Organisation Committee, has
become so very—so painfully—prominent that,
from being simply notorious, the clumsily ambiti-
ous parvenu has begun to be regarded with amuse-
ment and a good deal of derision. However, as
the Tories have to buy every vote they procure
from the ‘lower orders,” whereas the Liberal
party get an immense proportion of their votes
free of cost and as the result of the voters’ strong
convictions and preferences, a man like Sir Samuel
is too valuable to the Tories to be kicked down-
stairs, even tnough his frightful political manners
expose every one who has taken him up to a
certain amount of contumely and reproacn. He
is going to have a fight—or, perhaps, we should say
make a bid ’ —for the county of Buckingham-
shire, at the next general election. Probably no
one belonging to tho old Tory County families
cares to face the expense; and a vote in the
Commons is a vote, whoever gives It. We need
scarcely say that the above slight notice is not
extracted from London Figaro. That account is
really funny. It states, for example, that so ardent
is bir Samuels admiration for “his predecessor”
at Hughenden that be has not altered any of the
arrangements of the house. “The state-room re-
mains m the same order; the hooks are as they mere
vn the library.") We could have sworn to it.
Disraeli’s books are safe from disturbance by his
successor,” anyhow.
Sti'pmak, thedistinguished Nihilist, author
ol underground Russia,” docs not, because no
such writer dare, live in his own country, where
so many of his compatriots have been murdered
on the scaffold or in prison. Yet, by and bye, he
hopes to return to his inflamed native land and
take part in the struggle. His present home is a
village near Geneva where he occupies a first floor
consisting of two rooms each about seven paces
square, commanding a view of the land through
winch marched the legions ot Cmsar to the con-
quest of Gaul, and tho hordes of Attlla to the
sack of Milan. The table he calls his field ot
battle, his pen his sword; for every Jine bo writes—
almost every thought ho conceives—is either a
blow delivered or a thrust aimed at the fell
tyranny with which Russian liberty is so desper-
ately struggling, yet with sure hope of ultimate
victory. This celebrated member of tho Terrorist
party is about 30 years old, is tall of stature, and
nas Slavomcally dark hair. He writes slowly and
polishes with poetic care ; there are whole
chapters of his “Underground Russia” which
were written and re-written six times, and
even then sent to the printer with reluctance.
Stepniak, a man of intensely nervous temperament,
cannot work methodically as did (say) Anthony
Trollope. He usually goes to bed at midnight,
rises at two, and plies his pen without surcease-
save for refreshment—until noon. Then he sleeps
for about three hours, when he again sets to work,
and, until midnig.it, gives himself only one or two
short spells of rest. This goes on for five or six
days, a week, or until the task he has set himself
is accomplished; and while It is in progress he
drinks enormous quantities of tea and coffee, the
one as black as the other. Only a man of iron con-
stitution. and of otherwise temperate habits, could
long endure such a literary regime. Russia, he
thinks, has a brilliant future. The educated there
are devoted to humanity and progress: tho op-
pressed and unlettered masses are kindly and good-
natured—a traditionally barbarous system of Gov-
ernment is the sole bar to prosperity. The Czir’a
courtiers dread criticism as they dread dynamite.
Every exposure of Imperial tyranny in English
journals finds, sooner or later, an echo in the dark
realm of the Romanoffs, and hastens the day of
reckoning. The Russian police do not know Step-
niak, though he has been in prison. It is his
"golden dream ” one day to write a Nihilist ro-
mance which shall show the nobility ot aim and
simplicity of soul, the devotion to duty and the
love of humanity, that characterise In so marked
a manner the heroes and martyrs of Russian
liberty, whose outward life he has so vividly de-
scribed in his “ Underground Russia.”

COULBURN
THIS is an age of co-operation, and among the
most successful of co-operative Institutions
there are. perhaps, none which have benefltted the
masses more than Buildimr Societies.
But even these have not been free from objec-
tions.
For Instance: The system of compelling both
Borrowers and Investors to become Shareholders,
and consequently to pay entrance fees and .-.ppli-
cation fees, also of charging 3, (5, or 13 mouths’
prospective interest to Borrowers who may wish to
payoff their Joan, as well as many other charges
which press heavily upon those who are induced to
join with the view of obtaining a home of their
own, are among the relics of the old system—good
no doubt for the time when these Societies were
originated, but. like other things, destined to yield
to the iron hand of progress, and to be superseded
by a broader and more liberal policy.
The Australian Mutua' Investment ami
Kuildinir Company, Limited,
have under their System of Business so completely
cleared away all these unfair charges, that it is
only necessary to quote a few of the leading fea-
tures from tne Company’s Prospectus to prove
that they may justly claim to ho the most Liberal
Company in the Colony.
The Company, being registered under the “ Com-
panies Act,” their is no necessity for either Bor-
rowers or Investors to become Shareholders.
No Application Fees.
No Entrance Fees.
No Fines.
Borrowers share in the Profits, and o\ ery instal-
ment made by a Borrower or Land Purchaser
reduces the interest, because interest is only
charged upon the daily balance.
For the same leason Borrowers may pay off at
any time, with interest to date only.
Persons building through this Company are not
required to make any repayment while the build-
ings are in course of erection.
In all cases interest is charged or allowe 1 on the
Daily Balance.
Depositors lor 3 or 6 months have the right to
withdraw the whole or any portion of their De-
posit at any time with interest at the current rate
tor Deposits at Call.
Interest is also allowed upon current or open
accounts. This is found to be a great convenience
to those who have idle money, which for various
reasons they do not wish to lock up for any fixed
period.
It frequently occurs that purchasers of property
are compelled to Keep large sums of money unpro-
ductive between the time of paying the Deposit
and the time of completion; the Interest upon
which, if deposited with the company upon cur-
rent account, would more than pay all the charges
for conveyances, &c.
Fixed Depositors for 13 months participate in
the profits. Last year (1883) Depositors received
a Bonus of 1 per cent, in addition to the interest
allowed.
Land Purchasers have the following speeial
privileges:
1st. Small Deposit.
3nd. Easy Repayments.
3rd. Low Interest.
4th. 2h per cent. Discount for Cash.
5th. Free Deeds to Buyers of more than one Lot,
it the purchase money be paid within 13 months.
Land Purchasers are not required to execute a
Mortgage, as is the custom with some vendors.
There are therefore no Mortgage Fees, and conse-
quently there will be no charge for a release
when the purchase money is paid up.
These are concessions made by no other Building
Company in the Colonies.
6th. Every Land Purchaser is entitled to ft
Bonus.
Last year (1883) Land Purchasers received a bonus
ol 7 per cent, upon the amount paid off purchase
money during the year.
Under the old system the Bonus is only given
upon the amount which should be paid. If any-
thing extra is paid off, it does not increase the
Bonus.
But the Bonuses paid by this Company are com-
puted upon the entire amount paid off during the
year.
The Australian Mutual Investment and
lluiidiDgr Company, Limited,
purchase large Blocks of Land, sub-divide and re*
sell the same, and then advance up to nine-tenths
of the cost of buildings erected upon their Estates,
la place of leaving the sub-division of land to he
done by outside speculators whose only care was
to sell the land at as largo a price as possible, and
leave the purchasers to do as they please about
the improvements; the evils of which system are
too apparent in most of our suburbs to need com-
ment.
The Company is not only interested in properly
subdividing the land, but while assisting persons
to secure homes for themselves, are by such im-
provements constantly increasing the value of
their Estates. ,
The success which has attended the operations of
the Australian Mutual Investment and Building
Company, Limited, has been such that the deserve
or undivided Profits now amount to more than the
paid-up Capital, and the market value ot the *1
Share is now £2
This success, to a lar i e extent, is attributable to
the fair and liberal manner in which the Business
of the Company has been conducted.
Wherever there is great suocesit ia, as a rule,
the result of fairness and liberality.

of modern times.
It is a wonderful little instrument, which, while
it weighs less than three pounds, has the
LUNGS OF A FULL-SIZED PARLOUR ORGAN
and executes its music with
ABSOLUTE PRECISION AND PERFECT
EFFECT,
It has 22 reeds, plays in throe keys, and all the
parts of most difficult music.
To Mr, H. B. Horton, the Inventor, the world
was first Indebted for the Organette ; but that was
too expensive to come within the reach of all.
After years of persistent effort and intelligent
study, he has been enabled at last to place before
the world this complete little triumph over all
the difficulties of costand crudeness.
It requires no skill to extract from It any sort of
music that may be required, the list of three
hundred tunes which it plays comprising selections
from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes, Polkas,
Marches, Popular Bongs, &c„ Ac., &c. A child can
play any of these selections with perfect accuracy
The player requires no instruction further than
the few printed directions that are sent with each
instrument, and are so plain that “ he who runs
may read. It is best adapted to the kind of music
which suits an organ best, in which chords pre-
dominate ; but it has also wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces. It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card-holder for convenience 1
in singing. It will be found Invaluable for Country-
Churches, Sunday Schools, Family Circles, and,
for Dancing. Every shanty in the bush should be
supplied with one ; and every household which
cannot afford a piano or organ should possess an
Autophone. It will afford greater and better
entertainment than four times the price can pro-
cure if expended in any other direction. Since
they were appointed Sole Agents for this marvel-
ous little Instrument in the Australian Colonies,
18 months ago,
THE ORIENTAL GOLD CO.,
OF
474 George Street, Sydney,
Opposite the entrance to the Fruit Markets,
have forwarded hundreds of them to different
addresses throughout the colonies. Orders have
come to us from remote stations in the far North,
from distant mining camps, from many a lonely
shepherd on a far-off run, from farm-hands every-
where. from Sunday-school superintendents, from
clergymen, from residents of the cities—from
everywhere, in fact. And one of the best argu-
ments we can offer as to the genuineness of the
instrument, is the fact that, in all our corres-
pondence, we have never had a letter that spoke
disparagingly of it. On the contrary, we have
hundreds of letters on file from customers who
have written only to tell us how greatly they are
pleased with it, and that they will recommend it
to their friends.
’t is conceded by aU educators and moralists
that music is the great refining influence, and
especially with children, its effect for good is
boundless. The love for music which music in
the family engenders, is more potent in forming
dispositions and governing tempers than all the
treatises and lectures of the whole force of teach-
ers, pastors, and parents, and in conjunction with
these, is the oil or balm which renders an other*
wise hard task an easy one.
The price of the Autophone Is 80s.,
and where good music can be procured for such a
trifle, It is criminal for any parent (except, of
course, the absolutely poor) to let his household
be without it. With each Autophone for 80s. we
send three tunes of our own selection and a listed
catalogue from which the customer may choose
whatever tunes may suit his fancy.
All orders for music are $ent post-free by parcel
post, on receipt of list price, and wo make it our
business to see that all orders are promptly
attended to.
Send to us for catalogue of tunes at any time.
PRICE, ONLY THIRTY SHILLINGS.

M. Victor Hugo, author of “ Notre Dame
de Paris,” is still alive; while Mr. Andrew Halll-
day, who dramatised this picturesque romance, is
dead. M. Hugo’s novel alone would probably
have sufficed to have secured the immortalization
of any writer, while, curiously enough, all Mr.
Andrew Halliday’s adaptations have failed to keep
his head above the stream of forgetfulness. In his
time, Andrew Halliday adapted nearly as many
novels as the “ literary gentleman ” who was
drunk before his health was, at Mr, Vincent Crum-
mle’s farewell supper, in “Nicholas Nickleby.”
He adapted “The Miser’s Daughter,” “The For-
tunes of Nigel,” the poem of “The Lady of the
Lake,” and scored a big success in a melo-drama
of the “Badger” type called. “The Great City.”
Of the general character of his work, however,
“Esmeralda” may be regarded as an average
sample. And os a sample of the earpenter-and-
scissors-drama, the late Mr. Halliday’s work may
be regarded as mildly satisfactory, If not purely
artistic, ihresembles—wo can’t help it!—Mr. Doug-
las Sladen s verse in not being “ pernicious.”
♦ ♦ »
It may be stated at once (and forever) that
"Esmeralda or, The Gipsy Girl of Paris,” as at
present performed at the Royal, owes what suc-
cess it may have attained, in a large degree-if not
altogether—to its attractive scenery, and to the
generally liberal manner in which it is mounted.
The spectacular parts of the play meet with much
approval; but, as a simple matter of fact, Quasi-
modo and his terrors are, in nearly every instance,
received derisively. For example, when that
philanthropic hunchback says to Esmeralda in
the last act, “Don't be afraid if I come in and
look at you when your eyes are closed in slumber,”
there was a yell that made the welkin ring; and*
similarly, the mental and physical struggles of
Claude FrOllo were provocative of general merri-
ment. When Jenny Watt-Tanner, in a grotesque
make-up, asGudule (she was generally known as
“ Guddle ”1 bearded the Gipsies on the banks of the
Seine, and cried “ I’ll tell why a-rr-re baiter ye
soh,” nothing but good humour prevailed; and,
similarly, when Claude Frollo bored a hole in
Phoebus’ back, the hilarity became universal.
* * *
To us, the interpretation by Mr. Dampier
of Quasimodo, is a study in chalk and brick dust.
No more. Mr. Dampier is, perhaps, now gradually
attaining an age when men make mistakes oftener
than when they were younger. Many people do.
And thus it may have dawned upon aim that to
make his face up like Caliban, don a pair of panta-
loon’s fleshings, and stuff the hotel bolster up the
back of his jacket, would be all that was necessary
to identify him with the person of the JJossu-bell-
ringer. It may have also occurred to Mr. Dampier
that to “lug” in ail his hunchback business from
"The Duke’s Motto ” would render the conception
perfect. We don’t doubt this for a moment. We
do not, really. And if we cannot concede to Mr.
Dampier, in this instance, even diluted apiroval
for his version of an ideal Quasimodo, Mr. D. can,
at least, lay claim to our complete and absolute
sympathy.

We have only to preface our notice of Miss
Solange Navaro’s Esmeralda by stating — and
we wipe our perspiring brow the while—that the
management made her sing. Mdlle. Solange is a
young lady of generous instincts, and she likes, of
course, to give her audience (paw thing!) plenty
for its money; but we cannot but consider that in
singing “ Esmeraldah, bang, bang ” in so many
keys, she went far towards surfeiting the stalls
and embarrassing the circle—not to mention para-
lysing the pit—with gratitude. But, putting the
vocal efforts of Miss Navaro aside (and we do—
hastily), we are compelled to state that this lady’s
conception of the character is a singularly unfor-
tunate one. We are afraid that some of those nice
young men on the staffs of our contemporaries,
who are lavish, in certain instances, of their
critical confiture, have been spoiling Mdlle Solange.
we can sympathise with these trifling blades,
of course; but we can’t endorse their procedure
so far as criticism is concerned. Why should we,
when we are even called away from the composi-
tion of poetry to hang the baby’s shoes upon the
clothes-line ? There was plenty, of course, that
was pleasant about Miss Navaro’s Esmeralda, but
the art was not there; and, curiously enough, de-
spite her “ angularity,” she was, during her solo,
a weird and wondrous resemblance, both in volce-
mtiexion and facial expression, to a certain other
Miss Navaro who used to tell us nightly, with a
granite sternness of purpose and an iron inflexi-
bility of will, that “ seelvurr-ed wars herr-r
r-ravone hair.” In a word, Miss Navaro has not
caught on;” and, really, letting loose her own
particular French accent on poor Leake, when she
knows well enough that he, in replying, can get no
nearer to fhe prattle of the lively Gaul than
kleeker-street German, is alike cruel and inex-
cusable,
• ■ *
The Claude Frollo of “My Partner" se-
cured our respect—and also that of the audience,
f heir esteem, indeed, for Mr. Leake went to such
engtha that we are convinced that, had they be-
lieved he had been really slain in the last act, they
Would have had his body brought on in a wheel-
barrow, and have subscribed liberally towards the
funeral. His death was very popular. Charles
holloway was the giddy young Frollo, and his
get-up was darling, Indeed, We once saw Charley
Play Romeo, and, ip the words of Barbara, we
considered him “the beautifpllest creatpre as ever
was.” When, with the gasman working the soft
glow of morn up a ladder in the third groove O.P.,

chantment when, next morning, ho came down to

“oney from his brother to go round to the pub.
T*th, that went to the hearts of all beholders. We
H«ud have wished, though, that on this occasion
**b Charles had not borrowed so large an instal-
ment of his brother’s voice. The success of the

conveniently “double” the three weird «isters.

stop here; for we must confess we have not had,
so far, the pleasure of seeing Miss de Grey dance.

There was a great roll-up of those persons
who have the felicity of occupying positions in the
social scale, akin, even if somewhat inferior, to
that of the fair henefi(;iare-, and the assemblage of
Intrepid warriors in the kafe during the interval
reminded one somehow of the meeting of the
heroes after the Peninsular War. Miss de Grey
was pleasantly supported by her company (who
seemed, though, it struck us. to slilv enterinto the
spirit of the joke); and Adrienne herself was bom-
barded in the usual inane way with those floral
veterans with which we are all so shuddtringly
familiar.
* • « *
It is satisfactory for us to learn (from the
advertisements) that “ Mr. Fleming Norton, in his
unrivalled character entertainment,” is meeting
with “continued success.” It can bo little
doubted, ns Mr. Norton in his acumen advertises,
that ho indeed gave this weird and wonderful per-
formance before the Prince and Princess of Wales,
at Sandringham. In regard to thisespecial honour
conferred upon birr, Mr. Norton is brief in his
announcement, l ie stops short. He docs not say
anything about the qalnntim of turkey that ho
was regaled with as soon as it was done with “ up-
stairs”; or about how the seventh under-butler
dug him jocularly in.tho ribs, and said, “If you’ll
come ana dance for us down in the servants’ hall,
Mr. Flemings, you shall have a bottle of Johannis-
berg to take away with you in your portmantlo.”
Possibly, however, this did not happen at all, and
that Mr. Fleming Norton Wiis banquetted in Sand-
ringham House in as much state as Mr. Solomon
Pell was when he dined with his friend the Lord
Chancellor, on which auspicious occasion, it will
be cheerfully remembered, a man was on guard,
" in a drawn sword ” and silk stockings, during the
whole of the entertainment. It does not appear
to us distinctly improbable that Mr. Fleming
Norton’s Portraits” Ireally did find
favour with his Royal Highness. It is the kind of
thing, en effet, that would perhaps be calculated,
in a mild way, to tickle his Brunswickian brain.
But, we venture to mildly remark, that even an
expression of favour on the part of such a magnifi-
cent critic as H.K.H. is hardly sufficient to travel
upon.
• ♦ ■
What we have to complain most about
Mr. Norton, as an entertainer, is that he doesn’t
entertain. His struggles are as powerful as they
are praiseworthy; but, somehow or other, “it
isn’t there.” Possibly it may be In Mr. Fleming
Norton’s boots, and rendered thus Invisible to the
naked eye* but one thing very certain, it is invisi-
ble. It has been our unhappy lot, in answering
the strenuous call of duty at various periods of
our existence, to have assisted at nearly all the
performances of monologue (and, Indeed, other
similar) entertainments of the present decade. Of
these, undoubtedly, Houdin was the most original;
Maccabe, the most versatile; and the Wardropers
(one of whom is now dead, poor fellow) by far the
most artistic, taking them as all-round performers
in this peculiar kind of performance. They could
all sing, and sing well. To all of them was given a
certain amount of ventriloquial power; and they
could all- dance. Now, have you ever seen Mr.
Fleming Norton dance ? LWe feel we really ought
to give Mr. Norton a little send along at last.—En.
B.j Well, if you have never seen him dance,
“pawn your shirt for medicine ”— we mean for a
ticket; an and see Mr. Fleming Norton dance - and
die. The question now arises, can the delight of
Sandringham sing at all? Yes, he can certainly
sing, but it is a species of vocalisation which we
sadly own our grovelling antecedents render us
totally unable to appreciate. Finally, can Mr.
Norton make you laugh ? Of a certainty, he can
do that. He would makea wombat laugh- at him.
♦ ♦ ♦
We are, however, as we remarked before,
delighted that Mr. Fleming Norton is having
“continued success in his unrivalled character
entertainment, as given by him at the Egyptian
Hall, Piccadilly, London, over350nights.” Whoopi

Grattan Higgs has done so well with “ The
Irish Detective,” that he has wisely run it on, until
he can get'“ Peep o’ Day ” rehearsed in every par-
ticular. This piece is the best Edmond Falconer
eyer wrote; and, unlike “ The Detective,” It is
consistent in all its phases. "Peep o’Day” was
first produced at the London Lyceum about the
time Searelle flrat started out as a baby-pianist.
By the time Luscombe flguied as an infant com-
poser, tha “Peep o’ Day ” boy must have had a
considerable run. Alter Riggs’ season at the

to be developing into quite a colonial Barnum.

going to treat us to a minu principally composed
of “Maritana” (make* Mary Turner, we declare I).

Miss Marie Lanyon (they are all Maries!)
is a youhg lacy whom a kind Providence has en-
dowed with—since we must say it—a very con-
siderable amount of confidence; which, alter all,
is only another word for cheek. She bursts upon
us “unherkided,” as she humorously remarks,
with an American play, her relations, Sweeny, and
Jack Steele; and, billing her play as “Young Mrs.
Winthorp ’’ (sic), spreads herself out for an assault
upon the public purse. Startling as the facts may-
be, they are simply as stated; and, when we add
that “ Young Mrs. Winthrop ” is an American
play, the stupendous amount of “nerve” which
Miss Marie has embodied in her constitution at
once becompr apparent An American piayl

miserable jabbering pedlar, ‘fSamT O ’Posen;”

Picnic.” Clarke and Ryman, by the way, were the
most impatient men under criticism wp eyer met j
and that reminds us of something that-to use a
term ot their own—ought to “tickle you to death.”
When the C. and R. crowd first burst upon us,
fresh from the ’Frisco lunch bars and “dives,”
our social relations with them became strained;
and we used rather to bite our thumbs at one an-
other than otherwise. Well, one day a Boston
lightning-rod agront came to us, and he said—“ Sou
boys had better be a little less fresh; they’ve en-
sued Tom Sayers.” On receipt of this intelli-
gence, a thirst lor the green fields they “babble”
of took possession of us, and we went and hid
away in the fastnesses of Bondi, bribing Brown
with obsolete circus tickets to feed us on those
cheese and biscuits for which he is so renowned.
In a few days a bright idea struck us, and Young
Dutchy being then in town, we went to him with
money in our purse and purchased the protection
of that puissant pugilist. Next day, happening to
meet that Sullivan-like slogger, he being in his
cups, drew us aside and said—” I’m a goin’ hup to
Tamworth to start a yummy nasi on." “Horror!”
we cried, “ we are lost, indeed I What! leave us to
be ‘ knocked out ’ whenever he meets us, by that
terrible Torn Sayers! If more gold—-” “Lookit
here, ’ whispered Dutch with a hoarse chuckle,
you can bide easy. Why, Tom has slung me a
couple o yaller boys to protect him.” Then we
once more recommenced the thumb-biting busi-
ness. But to resume.
• • *
Whatever merit there may be in “Young
Mrs. Winthrop,” from a dramatic point of view,
Miss Lanyon’s company entirely fails to bring out
—and during the time wo were present, our senior
sensation was one of desperate dreariness. Tin's
being the case, we prefer to pass “ Mrs. W.,” and
judge Miss Lanyon and her company by their per-
formance in “Masks and Faces.” "Young Mrs.
Winthrop,” however, is well worth seeing, if only
lor the sake of the elongated “banger” sported
by Steele in the second act. Miss Lanyon’s busi-
ness manager is Mr. P. Warburton—whom, wo are
told, the lady had specially unscpulohred for that
purpose.

Our George (and this is strictly true)
Has lately been elected to
The Savage Club.

Gets treacle slaked on by the yard I
Here ’tls where Henniker’s immense.
And Martin (in a double sense);
Where frauds are fed
Who could not (since you must it learn)
By writing poems or pars., here, earn
Their daily bread.
But “ Savages ” don’t want a name—
They can buy, ready-made, their fame.
Let Heaton be a shining light—
A literary genius quite—

If we but breathed that atmosphere,
We’d die.
There, “ favourable ” critiques reign.

We read in the Burrowa Wombat, the
other day, of a young man who was struck dead
for telling a lie in the Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation. We are willing to believe this. But only
upon one condition—which is, that we hear upon
good authority that the Burrowa editor has been
struck dead since.

The tendency of the juvenile population
of this country is to satire, and, sometimes, to
satire of a sinful description. Thus, the other
day, a highly-respected clergyman had a present
made to him by the members of his confirmation
class. And what do you think it was ? Well, it
was a travelling-bag. We are as fond of a joke as
most people, but we consider this was more than a
joke. It was sbeer heartlessness.
We Invite our reader?, with humility—and
the reason we assume humility will become at
once apparent by perusing this paragraph from
Vanity Fair— a shilling weekly, published in
| London:—“ I have authority for saying that there
i la no truth in the report in the newspapers that
| Lord Queensberry has a bet of nine thousand to a
j thousand on Busybody for the St. Leger. The
I only bets he had were nine ‘monkeys’ to one
j against Busybody ; £250 on the same mare at
! other prices for various friends; and 600 to GOO
against Superba for a place. In all, Lord Queens-
berry stood to win £10,000, and owing to the plac-
ing of Superba’ihe lost very little over the race.”
We do not question, of course, that the writer had
authority of some kind or another when he wrote
this aesthetic par. — possibly that of another
[ flunkey. 'This information reminds us -of the
similar “rattle” of Mr. Chuckster, in “The Old
Curiosity Shop,” when he entertained the Gar-
lands with the fashionable gossip of the day at
luncheon.
We know the sort of man who writes
This elevated stuff:
His socks are silk, his kids are whites,
Ho travels on his cuff.
He also loves to recommend,
To further other ends,
A “ certain sherry” which he’ll send,
By sample, to his friends.
This is the chap whom titled folk,
On sufferance, let in:
Whose presence does at once invoke
The butler’s scornful grin I
But he’s impervious to this glee—
For thus it does befall.
He’d sooner in the pantry be
Than not go there at all.
If e’er you meet this scribbling thing",.
Avoid, by all the stars,
The “snip” whose praises ho will sing—
And don’t try his cigars.
His proffered race-tips do without—
They, like his “ weeds,” are bad.
For sometimes he will be a “tout,”
But always he a “ cad ”
Every day, somebody is writing to us and
asking us why we don’t assert our splendid intel-
lectuality, and soar to everlasting fame. Here is
one answer cut and dried for us from a Northern
paper. Please to observe: “A meeting of sub-
scribers to the School of Arts was held last night.
Mr. Griffith moved that the present committee,
with the exception of Mr. Shakespeare, had the
confidence of the subscribers, and that Mr. Shakes-
peare be requested to resign.” And the motion
was carried. And Mr. Shakespeare was shlUed.
After Ihis, is it any wonder that the original Wll.
liam wanted to know what there was in a name ?
And yet—we say again—people ask us to consent
to celebrity! Why, it is criminally ridiculous!
Who knows but in the days to come some creature
of our name might go home to contort a con-
stituency and write letters to the Jernel I Dread-
ful thought!

A correspondent of the Evening News

wanted one.” This is a pleasing evidence of the
rustic simplicity of the inhabitants in railway

Here is an item from Gunnedah which may
be interesting to the musical profession, though it

the local paper. Thus:-” We hear that the Min-

practice to get up concerts of a superior class, in
Which opera music will be largely used.” To drop
the negro business, mark you! This is great news

A scientific gentleman has just invented
an automatic arm and hand. He tried it on a man
who had lost his arm in a collision. The result
was remarkable. The man used it to pick up a

sorry, for the sake of the story, that he did not use
it to pick the inventor’s pocket. But we cannot
sacrifice the truth to a joke, however hen trovatn.
Still this reticence may not have been the fault of
the man. The inventor was an editor. The rest
goes without saying. We suppose they will never

A telegram from Brisbane says that a man

We should say it was the mistake of the man, not

strychnine, we should like to know? Why, if a
publican up there offered the ordinary shearer or
drover anything else,!they would hang him over
his own door. And how was this publican to
know that the man ho was serving had such a sllk-

To a still City of the Dead,
To call upon a citizen.
He had been famous in his day;
Much talked of, written of, and praised,
For virtues my small soul amazed—
And yet I thought his heart was clay.
He was too full of grace for me:
His friends said, on a marble stone,
HIb soul sate somewhere near the throne:
I did not know; I called to see.
His name and fame were on the door-
A most superior tomb, indeed;
Much railed, and gilt, and fllagrecd —
He'occupied the lower floor.

I looked—and knew it far his soul.

back it.” “Is that so?” exclaimed the quiet man
as he reached after a double-breasted sandwich;
well, now. It’s strange how men differ. When-
ever my wife dreams, I rush right along to chemist
Abraham’s and get him t’ give me something to

that neither of the dream backers’ horses were

AS SOON DIE AS LIVE
I have been a fearful sufferer for flffeen years,
most of the time with what has been culled eczema
or salt rheum, psoriasis and lepra, and the like, and
have always been told that there was no cure for
me, and have been so discouraged that I had an
soon die as live. I have been so bodily yflilcted
sometimes that there was not the smallest spot,
from the crown of my head to the soles of my
feet, that, was not diseased and as red as crimson,
ft would commence in small white spots, which
had a silvery appearance, but were not deep; but
if I attempted to heal them, or, soon after their
first appearance, they would burn end run to-
gether until there was a complete dry red scale,
which would become so inflamed as to crack and
look fiery and angrv, and the buring sensation
would be almost Intolerable.
I was at times so lame that I could scarcely get

helped for a time, I soon relapsed again to bo as
badly troubled as ever, and during the winter of

No Petersham ratepayer gets a grain of

able meal off pot-plants. If, however, he can
secure a sore-backed horse that can walk up and
down the people’s verandahs at night, he is elected

only chance for a mayoralty is to have a green-
painted spring-cart drawn by a one-eyed grey

“The Australian Portrait Gallery ” is an
illustrated work of which the first part has just
been issued by the Southern Cross Publishing
Company of Sydney. The part contains two very
finely-executed portralts-one of Sir John Robert-
son and the other of the Hon. W. B. Dailey, both
being excellent likenesses. The rather variable
and difficult expression of Mr. Dailey is especially
happily caught and preserved. A biography of
the conventional sort accompanies each portrait.
Mr. Macleod is the artist, and his work In this pub-
lication will remain a monument of his abilities.
The Ulerin, Watson’s latest 10-tonner,
hoisted twenty-five winning flags at the close of
the season in England, topping the list as far as
number of wins is concerned, and effectually
wiping out the hitherto invincible Buttercup, It
is a fact—or else the Field Is a perorater—that a
well-known “yachting lawyer” here has the lines
of a 10-tonner from the same draughting board,
designed about the time the Ulerin was produced,
which, if built on, ought to turn out a heeler. And,
on dit, another popular gentleman of the same
profession (what would the sport be without the
•‘yachting lawyer” and ‘‘yachting doctor,” de-
spite ‘ Selvage’s ” little sneer ?) contemplates
acquiring something spacial of the; same class;
so that, perhaps, next season, if not this,
the Sirocco may have to look to her laurels.
By the way, it is said that a protest has been en-
tered against the Asteroid taking the cake at
Double Bay regatta for carrying amidst her crew
a well-known gentleman who, although he has
not followed the sea for some years, is obnoxious
to the Double Bay Club rules if strictly construed.
It is wonderful how one man can steal a horse
while another can’t look over a fence; it is notori-
ous that the winning boat in the yacht race car-
ried two hands whose presence was even a more
flagrant breach of the rules than the case of the
Asteroid. It is an unpleasant and thankless task
to protest even where the case is a glaring one,
which is, doubtless, the reasoM why the Australian
is allowed to pocket the money in this instance.
All the same, rules are rules, and no one who en-
deavours to obtain an advantage over other com-
Eetitors .can grumble if they be enforced against
im in their integrity.

V,
1 HE COMPANY is steadily increasing its business, and bas recently Enlarged and Improved its Freezing Apparatus. A
amount of money bas been expended on Extensive Additions to the Company’s Works, and the Freezing Rooms, Chill Rooms,
and Ice Rooms are now sufficiently large for all reasonable requirements. About 300 carcases of sheep and 50 of heel can be frozen
■per diem the latter taking longer on account of the greater thickness. The butchers of the city have learned to take advantage of
the cold room rather than let an excess of supply spoil, after a sojourn in which it is good for at least three weeks. The fishmongers,
also are finding it is very handy and profitable to have a freezing room in the city. Should there be an unusually good display of
fish’in the Woolloomooloo Market, it is bought up, and the amount not wanted for the daily supply is sent to the cold room, where the
charge made is only nominal. In two or three days’ time the supply may be scanty, and the fish worth just double as much as they
were bought for. A considerable amount of frozen fish is often taken by the morning trains to the Southern and Western towns to
sunnlv country markets. The great milk industry of the Company is carried on in connection with the freezing rooms. The milk
is brought by rail from Moss Yale, Bowral, Picton, Menangle, Camden, and elsewhere, in the Company’s own trucks, which are
specially fitted to carry a certains number of cans about 5 feet in height and 18 inches in diameter. The trucks, which arrive twice
a day run right into the building, and the cans, holding about 50 gallons each, are hoisted by machinery to a higher storey, where
their contents are first tested by lactometers and other scientific instruments, and then weighed in, just as the supply is subsequently
weighed out. During winter, a considerable quantity is brought from Kiama by steamer. There is a screw at the bottom of the
cans through which their contents are made to run into large vats in the cooling room, in each of which is an agitator to prevent
the cream rising So low is the temperature in this room that milk can be kept perfectly sweet in it for two or three days, and even
longer A lar4*building has lately been erected, 120 feet long and 30 feet broad, where ice-making operations are carried on.
Here some very powerful machinery is erected for the production of clear, transparent Ice, by their new process. The ice is made
in effiht large wooden tanks, in each of which eight cells, made of two plates of iron 8 feet by 4 feet with three-quarter inch space
between them are placed, the tanks being filled with filtered water ; the cold brine is made to circulate through the cells, and the
water gradually congeals on each side of them, thereby forming large blocks 4ft. x 4ft. by 4 or 5 inches thick. These are hoisted
by machinery from the boxes and cut up, also by machinery, into smaller blocks, to suit the requirements of customers. A cold room
is erected here also so that the ice made daily in the boxes is there stored until required for consumption. The Company imported
several Danish cream-separators for the dep6t at Mittagong and the Sydney factory. The seven large vats in which the milk is kept
and the agitators work hold about 900 gallons each, it being necessary to keep a good supply in stock. At the Mittagong dep6t,
where there is also a freezing apparatus and cold room, surplus summer milk is converted into butter and cheese. A considerable
trade in this latter article is now being done, special carts for its delivery being employed, and the cold room of the Company gives
it great advantages over private dealers. Shoots from the large milk vats lead to the delivery-room, where the supply is weighed
out to the carts ° The importance of this branch of the business, in its relation to the daily food of the people, cannot be over-
estimated The Company commenced under great disadvantages, but Mr. T. S. Mort, the originator, whose genius has left many
mementoes in Sydney, was a far-seeing man, undaunted by difficulties. At first, 30 gallons per diem founded the trade; now 32
carts distribute over 1400 gallons daily. Another branch of the Company’s business is that of making ice, of which 20,0001bs. per
dav and 2 1 million lbs. per annum are distributed. The ammonia process is in employ at the works, which are at the head of
Darlin°“ Harbour and have a water frontage with a wharf, besides direct communication with the railway by a line running, right
through the buildings. The ammonia required is made at the works, and the necessary sulphate is from the gas-works. The engine
power’is continually being added to, and the number of shafts, belts, pipes, and pulleys to be seen at work is positively bewildering.
There are two engines, the sole work of which is to pump salt water from 150 yards away from the head of the harbour. Then
there are the pumps employed in sending cold water to various parts of the building. The fresh water used for the ice is all filtered.
In other parts of the works are workshops where all the repairs required are effected. The Company imports all the piping, &c., it
uses The stables, in which there are 70 or 80 horses, are entirely distinct from the works, and there is no possibility of the milk
heino- tainted by any effluvia or other influences to be ascribed to them. In this respect the establishment unique in this colony.
The °chaff for the horses is cut by steam-power on the premises. The harness-maker has a busy time of it, and there is regular
employment on and about the works for 200 pair of hands. The milk, butter, and freezing businesses are all rapidly increasing,
as everyone who has the health of the people at heart must wish that they should. The offices of the Company are at 21
Harbour-street. It was formed in 1874, the late Mr. Mort taking a large interest in it, which is still held in his family. Mr.
W Gr Lock who has been connected with the establishment since' its inception by Mr. Mort, is now the courteous and business-
like manager for the Company. Under Mr. Lock’s management, the interests of the Company have prospered most satisfac-
torilv and it is to be hoped that the gratifying success of the past may continue with them in the future.

Yung Sing Loo was an immigrant Chinee.
Botany was his location, and the rearing of veget-
ables his occupation. Born in the Celestial Em-
pire, the tates, at an early stage in his career, had
thrown him upon the shores of this our colony,
and It is whispered that even then he was “fly”
enough to evade payment of the usual £10 a nob.
Yung Sing Lee was a married man, and the celes-
tial olive branches appeared with a rapidity not
surpa-sedby the radishes and onions on the family
estate. And the interesting offspring of this
industrious Chinee showed their love for their pig-
tailed parent by weeding the carrots and keeping
the cabbages and the leeks free from slugs and
caterpillars. But these youthful Mongolians were
not all sugar; and from time to time required con-
ciliating and cajoling after the manner of youth
generally, and this artful Yung Sing Lee found
that nothing delighted them so much, nothing
rendered their good conduct for a week, at least,
a greater certainty than a trip to see all the
pretty things at Anthony Hordern and Sons,
Palace Emporium, Hay market.*

Only one man of our acquaintance was
lucky enough to drop upon Kufus for the Mel-
bourne Derby. His wife dreamt she saw the race
won by a horse ridden by a jockey with a shock
head of scarlet hair. Various were the surmises
made as to what the brilliant red covering could
mean, until, in looking down the list of probable
starters, they dropoed upon Rufus and the correct

Let no one ever accuse “ Spoil.” of a want
of pluck. Not that, so far as we know, such an
indictment has ever been preferred against
Fweddv. In the Zingari match, when eight
wickets were down tor 140, and ten runs were still
wanted to save a follow-on, “the Demon** and
Midwinter took the matter in hand, knocked the
Zingari bowling “all over the shop,” and finally
beaded the English score by four runs. Spotforth
dismissed seven batsmen in each innings, and in
the whole match took fourteen wickets at a cost
of 185 runs. M’Donnell’s 07 in the second innings
was a brilliant performance.
Derbyshire played ten matches this season,
lost the toss ou every occasion and lost every
match. Truth suggests that instead of following
so fluky a test as the toss of a coin, it should be
settled by a trial of skill between selected members
of the obposlng sides. “ Let the representative of
each eleven have a shot at the wicket from twenty-
two yards’ distance (the length of the pitch), and
then let the side of the winning thrower have
choice of innings. If both hit. let them throw
again: one will soon miss.” Thjs would suit Aus-
tralia very well, indeed. Get, for instance, Frank
Allan, who can hit a stump twice out of three times,
to throw for us.

The Toronto and tf.Y. papers aopear ut-
terly flabbergasted by Beach s defeat of Hanlan.
The Toronto Guo hr sajs that “it seems impos-
sible to suspect that now. after having reached the
zenith of fame, he would tarnish hi-* glorious re-
cord by ‘ throwing ’ the race with Beach. It is true
the temptations must have been many.” Flop-hoo
to you! The Toronto Maid thinks that either
Haulnn did not train properly, orcould not. There
is probably not a soul In Toronto who believes he
was beaten on his merits.” The N.V. Hkhaud
“thinks that the result does not necessarily imply
that Hanlan is losing his strength or his skill. Ho
was not ‘thoroughly acclimatised.’ The N.Y.
Tin bun E says 41 he must have been out ol condi-
tion-” and the N.Y. Sun says that “even those
who’lost very heavily by Hanlan's defeat do not
for a moment doubt that he did his best to win.

three-quarters of a length ahead of David, Bargo
a lengtn a way third; and, lo and behold, it came to
pass there whs extreme jollification thereat
amongsr the Yids. Malua romped in the winner ot
the Melb urue &takes; Fayo started at 5 to 2 for
the Hothim Handicap, an.i justified the confidence
pi ced in him bv w nnlng hands down from Hast-
ings: Newstead made an easy win of the Maribyr-
nong Plate from Monte Christo, Burnlda third;
Royal Irishman annexed the Selling Race: and
Josephine defeated Duration for the Coburg
Stakes. Rufus by King of the Ring-Princess
Ali -e, was backed pretty heavily for the Caulfield
Guinea 0 , but did uot run into a place, which no
deubnaccounts for bis being such an outcast for
the Derby.
The gallant little Australian certainly de-
serves a par. all to herself. It is about twenty-five
years since Dan. Sheehy put the little clipper to-
gether, audit reily seems wonderful .that, after
all tnese years of wear and tear, we cannot find a
boat of anything like her tonnage able to lower
her colours. Last Saturday her topmast broke
short off, but, notwithstanding the mishap, sbe
romped home the easiest of winners ; and
although the Sao might beat her in a right down
close-reefer, there cannot be a doubt the old
Beaky is able to prove herself the daddy, or rather
the mammy, in nine days out of ten. The Aus*ra-
Han has seen some rough work in her time, too.
We recollect when Mr. Graham—who is now P.M.
at Tenterfleld—owned her, a party of us started in
her with several dogs, for a shooting trip [down
the coast. It came on to blow great guns when
well out, and a gay time we had of it. We bat-
tened the dogs down below, and although she
shipped it green, she landed us all safe, none the
worse for a wet jacket.
Meek, the crack Yankee walker, has turned
professional, la which connection, Dismal Jemmy
or the London Referee [Do you refer to ‘ Pen-
dragon ”?-Ed. BO very truly remarks;. It is
always batter for a man to (Jo the honesty thing and
become a professional when he iinds he can no
longer afford to remain an amateur. One of the
most wholesome stories to be found in connection
with cricket is that of Richard Daft, then by no
means the wealthy citizen he has since become.
Finding he could not remain an amateur con-
sistently with his idea of honour, Daft went at
once and without hesitation over to the profes-
sionals. In Daft s case it is an open secret that
offers of more money than he could hope to get
among the players were made him in the event of
his deciding to remain a ‘gentleman. How
strange the term ‘gentleman’ often sounds to such
as have had anything like experience of its sport-
ing uses! The true gentleman is he who does as
Daltdld years and years ago—as Meek has done
just lately.”
Apropos of the wind-up match Smokers v.
Non-smokers, at Lord’s, the London D.T. remarks
that “ considering the prevalence ot the habit of
smoking, it does seem somewhat remarkable that
so many of the most prominent batsmen and
bowlers of Enaland or Australia should be able to
rank themselves as abstainers from the fragrant
weed which, in the words of good King James, is
‘ hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, danger-
ous to the lungs,’ and many other terrible things
besides.” The D.T. goes on to suggest that the
presence or the best bats (Grace ana Murdoch) on
the side of the non-smokers and o’ the best
bowlers (Spofforth and Palmer) on that of those
who “ blow a cloud, ’ may be used by the doctors
to frame an ingenious theory that proficiency
with the bat is the reward of those who do not
smoke, and who, therefore, do net voluntarily go
out of their way to render their nerves “ jumpy,
and, consequently, untrustworthy, at a critical
moment. On the other hand, the bowler, from
whom dash and variety, and that gift of nature, a
good eye, are required, does not need steadiikss ol
hand In the same sense as the batsman. A good
“nervous” bowler would probably enjoy mo-
ments of inspiration when he would “ mow down
all before him.” All the doctors’ theories will
not drive everybody to abjure henceforth the
“glowing ” bowl, as well as the “ flowing ” one.
“ The Evolution of Cricket ” is treated by-
Mr. Andrew Long in the current number of the
English Illustrated Magazine. Mr. Long
says the real strength of the Australians lies in a
department where no labour will enable us to
equal them, for “ the bowler is born, not made
and the Australians are born bowlers.” While
recognising the brilliancy of such batsmen as
Steel, Grace, and TJlyett, he is compelled to
acknowledge that the Australians have th** pull in
bowling, and in the universal power of run-
getting which pervades the team. In other
words, we suppose, Mr. Long thinks, but doesn t
dare to openly assert, that the Australians are
better bowlers and better batsmen, and, as an
almost necessary consequence, a darned sight
better all-round cricketers than the Henghshmen.
Or, let us say it again, in a way which won t rasp
against the jarred nerves of the genial Grace and
the hanistocratic ’Arris (’ow har you, me lud ?):
the Australians are born bowlers and the English-
men aren’t born batsmen. Apropos, that was a
truly terrible affair at (appropriate name!) Graves-
end, where his ludship, not content either with his
Kent victory or his leather-hunting on the 551 day,
got together an eleven of the South of England to
“ recover the ashes ” of home cricket and curry-
comb the kangaroo with a rake —and did it so
effectually that he was thrashed in one innings
with 107 runs to spare. The match-reports of this
truly shocking affair in the London dailies all
opened with a dirge bewailing the absence of W.
G. Grace, and wound up with a doleful sentence
hinting that nobodv could tell how the contest
might have gone had his ludship not been lame. A
lame excuse, indeed. Think of the ten English
wickets falling in an hour and twenty minutes
thus; 5, 15. 8. 5. 4.1, 1, 2, 4, 3-the balance being
represented by 20 extras made because Murdoch
kept wicket and the Australians went to sleep in
fielding.
It seems Farnan’s fame has crossed the
briny, as Sullivan is credited with having said that
he could “ knock out ” both Farnan and Greenfield
in one night; and, if Greenfield is no better than
the Victorian, we can’t see that it Would be a great
performance on the part of the American slogger
if he carried out his tnreat. Farnan may be a good
rough-and-tumble fighter amongst his own set,
but it makes us shudder when we picture him
before Sullivan—or even facing our own Larry.
By the way, a recent issue of the Melbourne
Sportsman stated that articles had come over
with the object of fixing up a match between
the pair, but we fancy Messoo “Androgoes ’ must
have been misinformed. Larry has offered the
Melbournian every inducement, and even said he
would throw in the champion belt won by him in
the ring, for a glove contest; but we have an idea
that Farnan will require a lot of coaxing before he
wib agree to stand up before the Welshman. As a
matter of fact. Farnan has no science, and when
he fought Jackson m Sydney—we did not see the
Melbourne affair— the darkey was ail over him
in the first round; but Jackson was very wild,
and struck half his blows with open hands, and ap-
peared afraid of his man. Should Farnan and
Foley meet, we shall not be surprised if Farnan
does not show for a second round. lolev is a
terrific hitter, fights for points, seldom throws a
blow away, and has a sledge-hammer right, with-
out which it would t*ke a man some time to knock
out a powerful stayer like Farnan. Talk about a
mother's lullaby—it is nothing to one of Larry s
right-handers. When Foley had his room in Pitt-
street, a Sydney jehu, a perfect brunette and any-
thing nut a “mug” with the gloves, bearded the
lion in his den. and stated his opinion holey
couldn’t knock him out. The gloves were donned,
but it was a regular one-horse show. The dark un
led off, when Larry landed his left on the mark,
and as the blow brought his opponent’s head for-
ward, he met him with the right on the point of
the jaw. And the subsequent proceedings m-
i crested him no more. Nor us either, for in less
time than It takes a Rum man to put a quart out
of sight the prospect of an inquest on the morrow
had flashed upon us.
Up to one o’clock on Saturday last, the
weather looked anything but promising for the
Double Bay Regatta people, but later on, old Sol
struggled out, and with a spanking south-easter
blowing, the afternoon passed off in rare style.
Mr. Anslow, as umpire of the pulling races, did
not have a sinecure, as scarcely a race was rowed
without a foul occurring. Messenger, with 4o lb.,
had a “throw-in” for the All-comers, his stable
companion, H. Croad (35 lb.), who rowed into
second place, being unable to extend him. I be
Residents’ race, in light skiffs, fell an easy victory
to Chamberlain (30 lb.), but a really gallant strug-
gle eventuated between Rawlinson and Ireland
for second place, which ended in favour of Raw-
linson. Ireland is a youngster, scarcely out of his
teens, and if he sticks to the game has every show
of making a name fOr himself. He rows in (rood
form, and reminds us very much of Matterson, but
like the Clarence River man, or rather boy, he
lacks swing. The maiden and junior double-sculls
both fell to F. W, Sharp, and C. Thompson,
a brother of “ Jacky ’ of that ilk. The Bal-
main Bowing Club crew came in first, but were
disqualified for jockeying the S.R.C. crew. we
fancied it rather sharp practice for Robertson and
Williams to start in a junior race; but events
proved that in sending in their entry they had not
at all underrated their powers. The senior double
sculls proved a soft thing for the M.R.C.—Seale and
Brett. The S.R.C. pair, Johnson and Kloster,
dashed off with the lead, while the “long un ’
contented hunself with a swing like a piece of
machinery, well knowing that la a fully three-
mile course the leaders woulu have to come back
to him. Before a quarter of a mile had been
covered, the red and whites, without [quickening,
passed tneir men, and the race soon resolved itself
into a procession with a rapidly-increasing space
between the component parts thereof. Brett
rowed in faultless style, and our amateurs, and
professionals, too, might well take a lesson from
him. The Australian lairly ran away from her op-
ponents for the yachts under ten tons, beating the
8ao by some five minutes, notwithstanding a mis-
hap to her topmast on the trip to Manly. The As-
teroid had a day to order, and made the most ot it
by beating the big half-deckers by some 7 minutes;
and the half-decfcers. 20 feet and under, resulted
in a win for the Nereus-a 20-footer put together
by amateur Golding, of Balmain. The Wanganella
unfortunately carried away her shroud-plate when
holding third place. Regina won the 16-ft. dingy
race; Donnelly and Sullivan’s creation, the Chance,
made small meat of tne other canvassers; and the
Curlew, 18min., won the limited crew race for open
boats 20ft. and upwards-a race, by the way, with
which we have very little sympathy.

1884;—Having heard of the beallng-'and curative
powers of ST. JACOBS OIL in cases of sore

SOCIAL
On the 24th Oct., a most pleasant evening
was spent In the Gundagal Assembly Hall, under
the auspices of the Social Kecreation Club. Some
■well-known gentleman of the town and families
found the district conceived It well to meet for
recreation, and the evening was the more harmo-
nious because a tine aew Ascherberg had been
lent by ME Cblville Smith, and among the twelve
dances were interspersed several vocal and instru-
mental selections of music. Mr. Bailey, of the
2.eka lI) > sang “ Let me like a soldier fall ” in such
style as to convince everyone that if he hadn’t
been made an editor, he would have been a hero.
“ The Nightingale’s Trill ” was deliciously solo’d
by a fair one of 18 summers; Miss Minnie Leary
gave a capital piano piece, and Mr. J. A. Smith, a
line baritone song, “ Hark the drum,” Mr. Machen
adding a comic dirge. As there is a penchant in
the district for fancy dress, cards wore worded
accordingly, and two ladies attired as the Press
Were conspicuously line. One dress was of navy
blue satin, elaborately made, with waterfall back;
the other, old gold satin, with ilcru lace, trimming
of golden shades, also lilies, sunflowers and daisies.
One young matron was attired to represent
Madame de Pompadour, whilst a charming demoi-
selle with bright eyes and nez retrousse personified
Lady Teazle. Then there was a damsel of stately
thlen from Cootamundra, who posed as America,
and found many admirers. Mrs. Bailey wore a
gem of cream satin—a very handsome evening
costume. During an interval, Mr. Weekes made a
short address stating that it was contemplated to
form in connection with the Social Kecreation
Club, other branches, such as lawn tennis, bowls,
archery, glee singing, dramatics, and to have pic-
nics, and nearly all present promised to support
the plan. The company partook of light refec-
tions, and about 3 a.m. the National Anthem closed
a fine evening’s amusement.

So artificial is society to-day that the very
mention of gymnastics for girls will shock the ears
of many a “line” mother, The idea of gymnastics
Is associated with visions of ill-bred romping and
vulgar strength, which they could never tolerate
In their doll-like daughters. The calisthenics at
•chool must only be of the mildest character;
Otherwise Arabella might get to be rudely health-
ful, and possibly even active, and then, of course,
she would be spoiled for all fashionable purposes.
In view of such a catastrophe, “fine” mothers
frown on girlish gymnastics. But for years past,
though only in a limited circle, a ladies’ gymna-
sium has been going on in Melbourne, and quite a
number of fashionable girls have been spoiled.
Their training has had such a disastrous effect that
many of them can run and jump, and even stoop.
Some have been known to walk as much as a mile,
straight away, heel and toe. It is very unjust to
cabmen and car-drivers that such things should be
allowed; but it shows how emancipated Melbourne
girls are getting. Only a few days ago, a fashion-
able audience gathered in the Town Hall, to gaze
on the melancholy sight of some sixty of these
misguided girls going through physical exercises
which are sure to rob them of that utter helpless-
ness which young ladies ought to cultivate in
modish society. After an exhibition of marching
to time, genuflexions, and exercises with rings,
dumb-bells, and clubs, the girls wore actually en-
couraged by Lady Clarke distributing prizes
amongst them, in the absence of Lady Loch, who
could only give her patronage. But the worst is
not yet told, for, after the prizes and refresh-
ments, several ladies not only approved of what
they had seen, but positively made speeches in
public advocating that girls in general should have
more exercise. Everyone knows that when a
woman speaks in public she unsexes herself. Sad
to say, this health heresy, this foolish fancy about
exercise being good for girls, seems to have
broken out in London. At the Health Exhibition
there, a number of young ladies, who ought to
have been lolling about on parlour sofas reading
Bow gave a show of gymnastics, which the
Princess of Wales was deluded enough to pro-
nounce pleasing. Even the illustrated papers
drew pretty pictures of them, which made them
look real little divinities In close, easy-lltting
dresses; with the designing intention, no doubt, of
getting people to regard gymnastics favourably.
But heaven forfend that the Sydney girl should
permit anything to disturb her statuesque repose.
• * *
Thursday evening, October 30th witnessed
one of the largest gatherings lately seen in Tenter-
field, at the plain and fancy dress ball in aid of the
the hospital. There were 100 couples present, who
kept up dancing with great spirit, to the excellent
music rendered by Mrs. Kelly at the piano. Notice-
able among the fancy costumes were two sisters
dressed as fried, White, aud Blue, and Pinafore. A
young lady from a neighbouring station looked
well in the costume of a Spanish Lady. A fair
young ledy, in the costume of a Schoolgirl,
daughter |of a townsman, shewed to advantage;
and a talented singer wore a very pretty dress, in
her character as Daisy Queen, Two married sisters
were well suited in their characters as Queon of
Koses and Black-eyed Susan. A fair young lady,
daughter of a station-owner residing in town,
looked really charming in white evening dress,
decked with flowers. The refreshments were
supplied by the ladies of the town, who worked
very energetically, and they expect to hand
over a good sum towards the hospital.
• * *
m Last week, the Mechanics’ Hall at Narra-
bri was crowded to excess at the fancy ball.
Ladles’ dresses wore charming, and we’re almost
airaifl to mention who was belle, for tear the
others will go fqf the poor girl. Nancy Lee’s be-
witching costume, however, held more beauty
than falls to the share of most girls. Some gentle-
men looked ill at ease, and one from tne opera of
’•Maritana” Nash-ed his teeth effectively at sup-
per; wnilethe gentleman who figured as Captain
Corcoran looked as sad as South used to when ho
struck a poor show town. A Jester was positively
funereal—perhaps grieved at the loss of his calves.
The P M. danced vigorously, and some of the rail-
way officials, not having evening costume at hand,
came in day costume. Of course, this was an ad-
vantage going home in the morning; it saved
changing. « » »
Saturday’s weather was most unpromis-
ing for the Double Hay Regatta, and when the
Emu left Circular Quay very few were on board.
But the afternoon lined later on, and a good num-
ber of visitors wont off from Double Bay wharf to
the flagship. Mr. Trickctt, and other well-known
aquatic men, as well as a bevy of ladies, graced its
decks, where the Vernon band played a selection
of music. The Bay itself was one of the prettiest
sights imaginable, crowded with scudding, white-
sailed boats, skill's, and craft of all kinds, and the
racing was well carried out; but the bright sight
of ladies’ gay drapery fluttering to the breeze
could hardly be looked for in such uncertain
weather. Mr. W. C. Stafford, as hon sec., care-
fully arranged everything to the best advantage.
* * *
Flower shows are quite fashionable in the
country. There was a grand one in the Oddfellows’
Hall, Tumut, netting about £40 for the Mechanics’
Institute. Simpson’s band played, and Mrs. M.
Marks was chief musician among the ladies. As
the opener said the refining Influence of flowers
would raise men’s minds above a mere sordid in-
terest in pounds, shillings and pence, the flower
show would be particularly beneficial to Tumut
people. Then Mudgeo has had a floral f<“te, the
chief peculiarities of which were that the local
editor quoted all the poetry about flowers he could
recollect in time for next issue; and an individual
burdened with the awe-inspiring name of Schlach-
ter gave a prize to be awarded by public ballot,
which is a good idea. It was for best floral device,
and the highest marks were won by Miss Lowe,
Misses Miller and Cox coming next. Two nice
Mudgee girls also combined to give a smoking cap
to the bachelor who produced the best lady’s floral
necklet. Wagga has just had its best show, and
Miss M. Pulver took three prizes.
• • •
A crowd of beauty in the flowered hall.
Crushes and blushes at the Ladies’ Ball!
With gentle pen, that not a soul shall vex,
Do we record the triumph of the sex!
That sex of whom, while on life’s troubled sea,
Our first fond memories were—our last shall be.
When we were, O! so little, young, and soft,
Still “trailing clouds of glory ” from aloft.
How well we recollect, all things above,
The emphatic tokens of a mother’s love;
How oft, to stop our flow of pearly tears.
She first would Kiss us, and then—box our ears.
She taught us early, but yet not too soon,
The benefit it was to “ have a spoon.”
Quite readily we still can call to mind
How, with that sweet uncertainty that marks
her kind,
Woman would mix up coaxes, kisses, slaps,
When we were littlest of all tiny chaps.
Next, we remember that as “ little girls ”
The sex appeared—they seemed all legs and
curls.
No steel .then cased their young and yielding
ribs,
They wore white “ pinnies,” and told awful flbs.
All heaven’s innocence seemed in their eyes,
But yet we rather scorned them at that size.
Till, older grown, ah! age of dreams and kisses.
They bud as Byron’s “ bread and butter misses.’*
Then at their present stage, the best of all,
Star-constellations at the Ladies’ Ball;
Like bright-eyed L’Allegro, all “ nods and becks
And wreathed smiles ”-0, cheerful, charming
sex!
The room is full of swiftly circling forms,
And youthful pleasure many a fair cheek
warms;
Here, well bedight, delectable, serene,
The sex in all its conscious power is seen;
Here, creamy garment falls in furling folds,
As if ’twere jealous of the gem it holds;
There, richly wrought, the fern-like spray of
green
In silk device on satin’s lustred sheen;
Here, pearly coronal blonde beauty decks,
There, crimson roses glow on snowy necks;
Mark now the voice, sweet, silvery and low,
The corsage bouquet, and the cunning bow,
The saucy eyes, the deftly managed fan,
All help to subjugate the weaker man.
Out o’er the balcony above the street
The hum of voices and of shuffling feet,
Tbe rune of waltzes like some tuneful sigh.
Float out, ascend, and fade beneath the sky.
If there was any fault at tbe ladies’ ball, it was the
simple one of the room being quite full. The
number present might be taken as an evidence of
the attractiveness of Glebe girls; and their fault
was one which all ball promoters aim at, but few
achieve. Having enjoyed the Glebe Point private
assemblies through the season, tbe ladies thought
a graceful recognition would be a return ball, and
the committee who made the ball so brilliantly
successful on Friday night were Mrs. F. H. Reuse,
Mrs. Sullivan (hon. treas.). Misses Bull, Long,
Paddle, L. Haslingden, Lomer, F. Wilson, and
Josephine Bull (hon. sec ). It must be understood
that the ball was not given merely to a committee,
but to all the gentlemen members of the as-
sembly, which made it a large undertaking and
i expensive. Yet such was the result, that it
is expected a considerable surplus will go to the
Children’s Hospital. So that others besides dancers
will be grateful to the Glebe ladies. Punctuality
was observed, the hall being well 11 lied by half-
past 8, and soon after crowded. With Messrs.
, Needs, Herman, and Blanchard at piano, violin,
and cornet, the music was fine, and the hon. se-
1 oretary of the ladles’ committee added a delightful
waltz, one or two others also obliging. Copapag-
nonl catered, and cloak-rooms were provided up-
stairs for ladles, and down-stairs for gentlemen.
Tne decoratlous of ferns and flowers, flags, etc.,
had all been arranged by ladies, and pot-plants
were placed along tbe edge cf the platform, while
a large “Welcome” was worked In white and
scarlet above. To Indicate any of the fair partners
as better than others would in this case be hardly
fair, since, having attended the assemblies, almost
all were skilful dancers; and, as to toilets, ladies
are not likely to display anything novel at the end
of the season, but they were all excellent. There
was not even one that would, in the critical lan-
guage of the sex, be called “a sight.” All the
committee wore tri-coloured streamers, and the
duties of M.C. were undertaken by that evergreen
and renowned bachelor, Mr. Robert Fairweatber.

Lady Loch’s garden party at Government
House, last week, gave Melbourne feminity a fine
opportunity to display its new Spring millinery
and apparel. White and cream dresses were most
plentiful, dainty lace skirts over light-coloured
lining, and lace-trimmed hats. One titled lady,
who is always modishly dressed, wore a soft deep
red, with vest of lace; but this was exceptional.
Lady Loch herself wore a soft silken white,
studded with raised silk dots, and trimmed with
white silk embroidery and lace; also a small Pierrot
bonnet of maize velvet and lace, with black lace
butterfly as its only ornament.

Our apartment is festooned with vine
tendrils, which creep confidingly in through gothic
apertures in the window-panes, and is shaded by a
gossamer-veil of cobwebs thoughtfully preserved
to ensnare the buzzful fly that oft disturbs our
musing moments. On the wall hang a tooth-brush
and a claw-hammer and an almanac—and will
eventually hang ourselves; but it is on the
almanac that we are gaz.ng with humid eye. For
with regretful fingers we have just now marked
the passing of a red-letter day—one of those days
which send us back sorrowfully to the work-a-day
world, burdened by pleasant memories and an
utter inability to reckon up our cash. It was at
Balmain, oa the night of the 31st, “the way was
dark, the wind was cold,” but we plodded on, for
wo wore sure of a welcome—of pleasant hand-
shakes and of sunny smiles. The occasion was a so-
cial given by those experienced Thespians,;the local
dramatic club. The inclemency of the weather,
together with the rain, prevented many from at-
tending, conspicuously absent being two fair and
Well-known faces, and one very familiar—but
you’d hardly call him fair—he, too, was other-
where. We allude with tears to Captain Gingah.
Notwithstanding drawbacks, however, the dance
progressed merrily, and a programme of 20 dances
was religiously observed. The Misses Jones were
there—all there—one in pink, and the other in blue
satin with short sleeves, and all the little fascinat-
ing accessories of flowers, lace, &c. Miss Hanby
wore a tastefully-made cream satin dress. An-
other lady appeared in a pretty costume, which
had a bright blue satin bodice and ruffled collar
of the same material, and a fleecy white skirt that
must have been delicious to dance in. A youthful
resident of the district, bearing a German name
which we can’t spell, looked to great advantage in
a cool white costume. Miss Davis wore mauve
satin and muslin—or was it muslin? we forget;
but it was terribly effective, so the end was at-
tained. Two ladies from the Shore were charming
in white satin ornamented with pearls and flowers.
Refreshingly cool and bright they looked, and
there wasn’t much difference to be observed when
they crossed the water somewhere about break-
fast-time next morning. There must be a some-
thing revivifying in the bright colours and odour-
ous blossoms on a woman’s dress which the meaner
sex, in its sombre regimentals, lacks—or how do
the girls keep up ?
• • •
On Thursday, Sir W. and Lady Olarke, of
Rupertswood, gave a fancy ball in the Melbourne
Town Had, which eclipsed in grandeur and mag-
nitude; anything ot the kind held there for years.
Over one thousand guests were present, represen-
tatives coming from nearly every colony, and the
great majority wore fanciful costumes. Of course,
all the usual accessories, such as furniture, mir-
rors, flowers, liquors, music, were provided at
lavish expense. The reception of so many guests
was a rather trying ordeal for the host and host-
ess, and especially - so a& attention had to be
t con 8tant strain too recognise familiar
triends in such fantastic and unfamiliar
guise; and sometimes even the announcement of
the name almost suiggeste d a mistake in identity.
However, ceremony is t’ae penalty which a rich
entertainer has to p>ay to ‘society. Those who adu-
late him demand at leas t that much. There was
the usual number of common characters, court
costumes, peasants, sail ors, and so on; but also
some novel and very beautiful ones. The trio of
Governors, Sir H. Loch, Sir W. Robinson, and Sir
G* Strachan, all wore evening dress; Sir William
Clarke, himself, the,uniform of the Victorian Yeo-
manry. Lady Loch, was in evening attire, so was
Lady Michle. Lady Clarke appeared in ,the
character of Marie Antoinette in a trained
dress of pink brccade, with pale blue silk
petticoat, and a dazzling display of diamonds.
Miss Clarke was |E awn; Miss Ethel Clarke, Twi-
light; Miss Bella Cl arke, a Hornet, in brown satin
and gold braid win gs, and a waist contracted as
far as convenience would allow. Miss Grice was
original as the Futu re Footwoman, and Miss Ethel
Moore chose the character of Beatrice Cencl,
surely a peculiar choice. Elaine, from Tennyson’s
Idylls, was a really beautiful conception. Captain
Des Voeux was in /Indian military dress : Sir
Patrick Jennings, evening; Mr. Byron Moore
raced round as a Neapolitan Fisherman; Sir A.
Michle, Court dress: Sir F. Murphy, a Disbanded
Volunteer; Mr. Cosmo Newbery, an Astrono-
mer’s dress, whatever that may be; Sir A.
Nicholsen, Cavalier of Henry IV.; Lord William
Neville, as Edward VI.; Mr. J. B. Were, Danish
Consular dress; Miss Raleigh, Empress of China :
Lady Nicholson, Maltese Lady; Lady O’Loghlen,
Ve Olden Time; Mias O’Loghlen, Going to Market;
Mrs. Shanahan, Tho Woman in White; Miss Snod-
grass, as Hope, wore a dress of white satin trimmed
with gold cord and the emblematic anchors; Lady'
M'Mahon, Spanish Lady; Lady Murphy, Lady of
Queen Bess’s time; Mir. Fitzglbbon was Leona to,
and Mrs. Fitzglbbon, Beatrice; Miss M’Farlane was
Marie Stuart; Miss He nty. Starlight. Such areia
few of the chief characters.

HARTFORD. CRU.S.
Madame Theo has been accused of possess-
ing the most magnificent arms and ‘shoulders of
any lady on the stage.' At any rate, she is a beauty
in every sense, and hdr dresses are intensely cun-
ting. Not long ago, a reporter interviewed her
(and Theo usually conciliates the press). He found
the famous actress in a close-fitting dress of vail-.
rclioieuse. cut V-shape at the neck so as to half
reveal the superb bust beneath. When he rose to
go, Theo took a rose from her corsage, and grasp-
ing it in her plump littlp hand, plunged it down
into the voluptuous Interior of the Y-shaped dress.
There she held it for several moments, and then,
drawing it out, she pinned it to her visitor s coat-
flap, saying, with a smile, “ There’s a warm rose for
you.” It was a very trying moment for the lite-
rary man. 4 s
The clerk at a crack New York hotel made
some interesting disclosures about visitors who
leave things behind them. These relics include
everything thinkable; but the most numerous
article of all is—nightgowns. “ Nightgowns,” he
said, “beat everything; we have now nearly five
hundred, keeping them in case they are applied
for. But they very seldom are—bless you, most
people wouldn’t admit the ownership if we sent
them to them. Some are very dainty, elaborately
embroidered, or trimmed with expensive lace.
Others are shaped to fit, and sometimes the owner’s
name in full is artistically marked. Annie Pixley,
the actress, left a white satin night-dress here last
time she stayed; it was embroidered all down the
front with coloured silks--mugt have cost 60 dollars.
But she wrote for it.” It was probably Miss Pix-
ley’s Sunday garment-

Political Points
The 8000 roses which decorated the Russian
Imperial supper tables at Warsaw scarcely covered
the multitude of skeletons which were present at
the feast. Nor did the tray music scare away the
' ghosts of the Polish patriot Kosciusko and “his
trusty warriors, few and undismayed,” which
hovered round the truests.
is a common practice now (says J ustice,
the organ of the English Social Democrats) to at-
tack any Socialist who happens to employ men.
There are not many of them. But it seems to us
--tbat-a capitalist who pays his employes well, and
spends hfs money in trying to upset the system he
profits by, is a benefactor to the race.
“Anti-Conservative Demonstration” is the
heading given by the S.M. Herald to a cablegram
from its “owh” correspondent, announcing that
Lord Salisbury while on a visit to Dumfries was
stoned by the mob. Had the incident happened to
(.-EarlBnenoer, In Limerick, the heading would have
, Dastardly Outrage by the Irish.”
It is doubtful whether the French Com-
mune would find the same leaders It found in 1871.
Rochefort, Jules Valles, Pascal Groueset, and
others have become well-to-do citizens; the
former two are getting on in years, and the latter
has paid so heavy a penalty for his revolutionary
tendencies that he is not likely to recommence
them.
EacTv Anne Hamilton, in her records of
Court life, states that the first Marquis of Conyrig-
ham obtained his title through the sacrifice of his
wife to the libertine (God save the King) George
IV. Vet English liberals are unprincipled enough
to talk of doing without a House of Peers. Why,
it is a blow at Royalty itself. Two-thirds of the
Peers are descended from Kings and—harlots, i
“Why,” asks Troth, “should the Austra-
lians wait for a Federation Bill to become law ? If
the Australians are wise, they will hold a Congress,
and proceed to federation without troubling them-
selves about English consent. And it they are
animated with a spirit of justice, they will at the
same time declare their readiness to make an
annual contribution towards the general expenses
of the Empire,”
When the Czar visited the 4 Greek Church,
Warsaw, a bourgeois presented a petition to him,
notwithstanding the diiHculty of approaching. At
first the Emperor started visibly, and then ordered
his carriage to stop, and promised to help the man,
who was, however, taken to prison by the police,
Alick thought the document was a death-warrant.
The Huesian pobce are great philanthropists. They
help men—to prison.
Thus an English paper, prior,to the event:
“The Czar’s visit to his faithful and loving .sub-
jects of Warsaw is to be a grand festival. No
strangers to be admitted to Warsaw hotels and
restaurants: houses searched daily by the police
and troops; the palace undermined in search of
■ Wines; 300 men and 17 women lodged in gaol; and
all the trees on the Czar’s route cut' down, Jest
some Nihilistic Zaccheus should climb thereon to
'cotch sight of the Emperor. Are not.all those
glad signs of the coming of the Great White Czar,
the Father of the People ?”
■ Here is treason. From an infamous paper,
"W London Daily News:-”Arab!, the only
native Egyptian loader and patriot whom modern
Egypt has produced, and who, in spite of his exile,
commands more popular affection and respect at
this moment than all the Viceroys of Egypt can
boast of put together.” These are the things
which the Sydney daily papers do not quote—the
Sidney dailies, which worship wealth and tyranny
Sind which denounced Parnell a'd Araol, the
nationalists, as cowardly assassins. The Bulletin
was the only Secular paper in N.S.W which dared
to say a word for either man. Who is right now ?
The competition of Indian wheat coming
upon an over-burdened market has reduced prices
'to such a level that ruin stares the American
’ small farmers in the face. Thus the increase in
'the production of wheat in Northern India-which
does not benefit the Indian cultivator under pre-
sent conditions—should help to ruin the American
«rmers. whose competition has already shaken the
igllsh agrarian system to Us foundations, it is well
y tfi bear in mind that political economy is a progres-
sive science, and that so-called economists who
content themselves with the old superficial non-
ufense are simply blind leaders of the blind. Nova
t GAm uria, please note.
In a Boer raid on the Zulu chief .Mont-
rj.oa’8 territory, Mr. Betheli, a young Englishman,
friend of Montsioa’s, was captured by the
SSutchiuou. Ho (Mr. Betholll had, though b dly
SJrounded in the eye, returned to assist a sou of
*Montsioa, who was alsolwounded and lay prostrate
on the ground. to fret hack to their,lines. The
Boers said: “ Ahl now we have got you. We have
long waited for this. What shall we do with you,
you Englishman?” Bothell replied: “I suppose
you mean to kill me—you can do so if you like.”
They walked away a few pace® and consulted for
a momcfnt. Then they turned round and in cold
blood shot Bethell dead.
Admiral Sir Edmund Hornby (the officer
who commanded the flying squadron which visited
Australia a few years since) thinks it would be an
act of statesmanship and a benefit to European com-
merce for the French to annex Formosa,S He says:
“ If a ship comes to grief anywhere near its coast
or takes refug6 in any of its harbours, the crews
arc certain to be murdered or sent off to work in
the mines. At this moment it is supposed that
hundreds of European sailors are so immured.”
Indeed, the “China Sea Directory ” significantly
cautions mariners that “the natives of the south
end of Formosa have always been hostile to
foreigners, and their traditional propensity for the
collection of skulls is so well authenticated that,”*
&C. &Q.
It haying been reported that O’Donovan
Rossa, disguised as a Roman Catholic priest, had
left America for England, the police kept watch,
and one day, whep a priest from Dublin arrived in
Birmingham, and called upon the brother of Egan,
who was sentenced to twenty years’ petfiU servi-
tude for his association in the dynamite conspiracy
with Da y, they concluded that they were on the
track of a “good find,” especially as the ecclesi-
astic carried a bag—probably full of bombs. The
priest saw their mistake, and carried on the joke
at their expense. He bailed cab after cab, and was
driven all over the town, followed by relays of
detectives* Finally, he drove to the railway-
station, and booked for Birkenhead. His “ nitro-
glycerine” bag contained books, a subscription-
list (of course), and some collars.
Malthusianism* that devil’s gospel which
the wealthy rely on as furnishing justification for
universal selfisnness, is getting roughly handled
now-adays. It is argued by the Socialists that the
power ot man over nature, his capacity to produce
food and other necessaries of life, is increasing far
more rapidly than the increase of population in all
civilised countries. Second, that the very fact
that the well-to-do have fewer children than the
poor, proves that, as Adam Smith said long ago,
poverty seems favourable to generation. ■ In a
Socialist state, therefore, where all would be well-
to-do and none poor, the probability is that the
increase of population would be less than it is
now. The Malthusians are asked to account for
the existence of the evils attributed systematically
to “over-population” in wealthy France, with a
decreasing or stationary population ?
Thus Truth : “I suppose that there are no
people in the world so fond of remarking motes in
the eyes of others, and so blind to the beams in
Iheir own eyes, as we are. We are morally indig-
n«nt with the French for warring with the Chinese
through lust of empire, and we are terribly
shocked at their having destroyed the Chinese
lloet. iSuoh barbarism we did not imagine to be
possible! And yet, whv did we bombard Alex-
andria ? Whv did we make an Admiral a Peer, and
give him £30,000 for this lent ? Why, too, did we
make a General a Peer, and give him a like sum
for defeating with much slaughter a crowd of
Egyptians—so harmless that when half-a-dozen
Arabs attacked them with spears, they did not
even attempt to defend themselves ? When the
French make Admiral Courbet a Peer, and give
him a million francs for sinking some Chinese gun-
boats, and when they compare this victory to the
greatest achievements of modern war, it will be
time enough for us to abuse and jeer at them.”
There are ‘33 English war-ships in the China
seas. Of these, however, fifteen are small and of
four to six guns each. Moreover, one (a turret
ship) is “laid up” at Hongkong. A second is
merely a despatch vessel, and two gun-boats are
deficient in Crews. The principal vessels of the
English fleet on the China station are the Auda-
cious, which is the Admiral’s flagship; the four
corvettes, Champion, Cle'q-.itra, Cura«?oa, and
Sapphire; the Daring, and the Albatross. The
last-named has only lour guns. The Audacious
has fourteen. Though she is the fastest vessel in
the fleet, she can only steam 13 knots an hour.
The French have 38 ships on the China station,
and tour more are on the way to join Admiral
Court et. Of these 38 vessels, eleven are very small,
carrying only one gun or two guns each. But, in
other respects, the French ships are mostly large,
strongly built, capitally equipped, and fast sailers.
Adm.ral Courbet’s flagship, La Victorieust, is
heavily armoured, and her guns are breechloaders.
Indeed, the French ships appear to carry nothing
else but breechloaders, supplemented by machine-
guns. The English armament, on the other hand,
•consists of muzzle-loaders. Three of Admiral
Courbet’s ships can steam from 14 up to PiJdj knots
an hour.
It is well to look at our position sometimes
from the standpoint of our enemies. Looking for-
ward to a war with England, against which as a
friend of the bondholders he is irate, M. Gabriel
Charmes defends ferociously letters of marque,
and holds up Captain Semmes, of the Alabama, as
a model to the future naval heroes of France. As
England’s greatness, colonial and commercial, is
due to her merchant navy, privateering would not
only be legitimate, but would be imposed by
patriotic duty in a war. Big vessels are now at the
mercy of torpedo boats. Swift, light, blockade-
runners, privateers, and torpedoes will render
heavy armed ironclads useless. England would
be crippled if attacked in the five or six chief
maritime routes which connect her with Asia,
America, Africa, Australia, and Belgium. Her
factories would collapse, her industrial population
would bo given over to the horrors of famine, and
Groat Britain would sink to the level of Holland.
Twenty privateers, commanded, by daring cap-
tains, resolved to destroy pitilessly every Eng-
lish merchantman, would, paralyze her. M.
Charmes is for merciless sea warfare. He appears
to forget that England in ship-building enthrfirize
is ahead of all other nations. M. Charmbs cites
Admiral Aube to prove that a score of Alabama
would suffice to annihilate England’s ool’onial'and
commercial power.
Tempora mutantur, &c. And a better
proof of the truth of the old classic adage could
not bo found than in the change a few years have
worked in the opinions of Slr ’Enry Parkes touch-
ing the federation of the Australian colonies. In
a paner contributed to the Victorian Review for
January, 1881, entitled “Intercolonial Agreement,”
our Jim Crow statesman let himself out as follows:
—“It may be justly maintained that every occa-
sion for bringing the ruling minds of Australia
into consultation, whatever may be its apparent
fruits, will be an occasion for advancing the cause
of Federation. As men gain a better knowledge
of each other, they will desire to gain a better
knowledge of each other’s country. From the ex-
amination of one question in a broader light they
will accustom themselves to the contemplation of
other questions In a broader light. By estimating
the advantages of eo-operatlon lu g given case,
they will the sooner be prepared tio-admit‘> the.
general benefits of permanent union. There is no
fear of mischief arising from too many conferences,
which, irrespective of their immediate uses, may be
regarded as the natural nurseries of the federal prin-
ciple.” And to-day, our all-things-to-all-men hero
coolly declares, “ But I venture to say here what I
said when I had an opportunity in London, what I.
ventured to say to Lord Derby himself, that this
Federation scheme must prove a failure." Of course
It must, now that the Great Panjandrum Is not at
the head of affairs to float it; in fact, the wonder
is that Australia sticks together at all without his
omnipotent rule and guidance.

The Tipperary farmers have prevented'the
landlords from fox-hunting. Mr. 0’Brlen, ,/ M.P.»'
advised them recently “not to provide sport for
Earl Spencer now that the times were dull and the
hanging season was over”...On Labour holiday
this year, in New York, the great demonstration
was headed by a band of 3000 coloured men. The
feeling against the black man Is dying out in
America. The question of their admission was
discussed by the Central Labour Union, bpt hardly
a voice was raised against them; and not. only
were they invited to head the procesSion/but it
was declared that in future all trades organizations
| shall be open to them, and that no difference in
| creed or colour shall be recognised by the work-
j ing-men of America. No Chinese, however, will
be there — There were 60,000 applications for seats
at Mr. Gladstone’s Edinburgh meeting The Ger-
man Admiralty Is holding experimental torpedo-
boat competitions. A torpedo-boat, built at
Stettin, was raced against an English-built boat of
the same class, and the former won easily, its speed
averaging nearly twenty-three miles an hour
The average annual increase in the national debts
of the world sir ce 1848 has been £974867,000. and If
they go on augmenting at this rate until 1000, they
will have reached £6,500,00,000 sterling... c. Joseph
Arch, who will probably stand for Parliament at
next election, is urging the English labourers to
insist upon capable land being cultivated, or im-
position of a tax upon untllled land. He also ad-
vocates fixity of tenure and fixity of rent... The
Russian Empress’s reception of ladies at Warsaw
was unattended by the Polish noblewomen. Only
the officers’ and officials’ wives came. At General
Gourko’s ball, out of 800 invitations only one-half
accepted. The nobility and the bourgeoisie stayed
away—The object of the “National League of
Great Britain” is to organise the Irish vote in
England and Scotland, so that it may be “ thrown
solid ” for candidates of any political party who
will pledge themselves to co-operate with the Par-
nellites....The “treaties” made by the French
with the African niggers seem to be just as genuine
as those made by the English and other nations
with unsophisticated savages. The King of “ the
Mayombe country ” was recently forced to sign a
treaty with France under pain of being shot
An Edinburgh gentleman has placed £1000 in the
hands of trustees In order “to bring before the
public mind the question whether there are any
means by which the labouring classes may more
fully share in the products of industry.” Just
what The Bulletin Is doing gratis.... A Chinese
Viceroy recently quelled a riot between tee people
and the troops by merely observing:—“ For each
life lost I shall take a head on the other side.” ....
In Italy, 33 million francs are spent annually on

The Irish National League will, at the next gene-

They were unusually vivacious the other
night in the Victorian Assembly. When the
honorable gentlemen feel the end of a vein of
humour they spit on their hands, get astride, and
ride it till its back gives way. Then they tumble
about promiscuously, and each blames the other
for having been too ranch of a dead weight. On
the occasion under notice the talk was about the
rapid growth of population In the splendidly-
endowed colony, and whatever Mr. Deakin, the
Solicitor-General, said, it brought no Mr. Gaun-
son with the merry innuendo, “ Mr. Deakin is n6t
taking into account at all that the country is
growing, although he has got lately married.”
After cantering bare-backed on this piece of
metal for a while, he gripped the mane and let out
again: “I am afraid that the Minister for Rail,
ways is out of the running as far as contributing
to the population of the colony is concerned.”
The paco was becoming reckless. Half a dozen
members now clambered up the sides of the thing.
Then the Minister for Railways pointed at Mr.
Gaunson, and cried, “ Well, you are pretty well
wound up.” After that there was a smash and
the customary scramble. '
A little obituary ad. appearing in the re-
spectable columns of the Melbourne Argus, has
furnished us with food for much pious reflection.
The ad., after drawing attention, in prose,) to the
untimely decease of Mrs. , concludes with a
burst of poetry:—
“ Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on his gentle breast;
There by his love or shadow,
v . Sweetly my soul shall rest.”
There’s a poetic vagueness about this calculated
to set anyone—even an alderman or a C.M.G.—
thinking. We must expostulate with this adapter
of Sankey’s touching lay. To be complimentary,
we will make our protest in verse—
Dear friend, pray permit us to gently remark.
That as to your meaning we’re yet In the dark;
(A state of affairs which is really too sad-o);
Now whteh does she rest by—the love or the
shadow ?
Here id. a most contemptuous epigram,
addressed to an orthodox Conservative author of
a stupid “ Answer to Renan ” ;—
“ You answer, Renan! That is strange, if true.
Men only answer when they’re spoken to;
And Renan speaks to scholars—not to you.”
, Everyone is well aware of the decided ob-
jection most men have to sitting on a “ demnition
dead body” as a juror, and of the many devices
resorted to by the coroner and his myrmidons to
secure a full panel. Therefore, solely in the ends
of justice, we tell the following true tale, in the
hope that the hint may be acted on, and future
corpses will not be unduly Inconvenienced. One
jday.-ln a sparsely-settled district out West, a dead
Chinaman was found in the scrub, and he had evi-
dontly afforded a three days’ picnic to all the crows
about the district who possessed the time and in-
clination to enjoy tips free land-sale sort of
luncheon. This being’ noised abroad, all the male
residents suddenly discovered they had important
business out of the town ; and the “ crowner’s
’quest ” had to be postponed from day to day,
until at last the defunct Celestial began to raise
some extremely high objections to being kept
before the Court any longer. Things having gone
so far,, the despairing coroner was about to let the
.beggar rip and take bis chance, without the sweet,
sacred consolation of ap inquest, when suddenly
the breathless “sarglnt,' who had been scouring
round, rushed into Court and exclaimed, “ It’s all
rolght, yer Anner; we’ll hev a full jury rigged be
13 o’clock. Oi’ve got tin av ’em looked up in the

INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT.
WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Why is it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, npt only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others; yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
Intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious, A few doses of Emil Frese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.
FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OTHERS.
Glenmore Road, Paddington,
14th January, 1884.
Gentlemen, —Some few weeks since I was so
severely affected with Indigestion as to render my
rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the back; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of which
I was by no means lit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, I
used it myself, the result being that I was myself
in three or four days, and have not suffered since.
My friends have advised mo to write this for the
guidance of others, and you arc at liberty to make
what use you please of this.
Fours,

Messrs. Elliott Bros., Sydney.
At 10 o’clock last night the alarm was
given at the Central Fire Brigade
Office of a lira having broken out at
the house of Tomkins, labourer, Soot-
land-street, Wai erloo.
The brigade turned out, with one manual,
with their usual dispatch; but the inmates
and neighbours bad the tire extinguished by
the time the firemen arrived, and they re-
turned at once to their station.
. • . .«• V* ' ’
The fire originated through the
careless handling of a candle. The
damage done consisted of the
burning of a bed and bedding
and the curtains of a window in
a front room on the ground floor.
Tomkins is tenant of the premises,'
and Mr. Jockell is landlord.
The house, a weatherboard one, is not
insured.

HUMILIATING BLOTCHES
WILL MCDONALD, 2543 Dearborn-street, Chi;

Salt Rheum on Head, Neck, Face, Arms, and Legs,
for seventeen years; not able to walk except on
hands and knees for one year ; not able to help
himself for eight years ; tried hundreds of reme-
dies ; doctors pronounced his case hopeless ; per-
manently cured by Cuticuba Resolvent inter-

CUTICURA REMEDIES are the greatest medl
cines on earth. Had the worst case Salt Rheum
in this country. My mother had it twenty years,
and in fact died from it. I believe Cuticuba would
have saved her life. My arms, breast, and head
were covered for three years, which nothing re-
lieved or cured until 1 used the Cuticuba Resol-
vent internally, and Cuticuba and Cuticuba
Soap externally. J. W, Adams, Newark, O.

Sir.—My patients have given
me 8 very satisfactory account
of Dr. Scott’s Electric Hair Brush.
One lady assures me that she gets no
neuralgia in her face if she uses it, and
others state that by a few minutes’ brush-
ing with tho Electric Brush, a nervous headache,
or one arising from overwork or debility, is quickly
removed. The invention is, I think, very valuable.
I am, your obedient servant,

Why should not discounters make a prac-
tice of giving formal notice to all the parties to
each bill they negotiate, that they have negotiated
It ? Why should it not be compulsory upon them ,
so to do ? It is the custom in many countries to
take that simple precaution against the swindler.
No doubt there are some discounters who prefer
a “ crooked ” bill, seeing an extra security in the
very fact of its crookedness; but, putting the ex-
ceptional aside, it is certain that a lot of fraud
would be prevented were it the custom for banks
and financiers to formally advise the owners of
the several names on a bill of the circumstance of
their having “ melted ” it on such and such a
date, &c.
Henry George has received hia coup cle
arace: his reputation is shattered—bust up—de-
molished. Henry George as a social reformer is a
thing of the past, relegated to the limbo of
obscurity, never to emerge therefrom. Fitzgibbon,
the Town Clerk of Melbourne, has killed “ Pro-
gress and Poverty ” with a pamphlet. Snatching
a brief respite trom parochial duties, the Town
Clerk threw off a satire, wittily entitled “The
Essence of Progress and Poverty,” and displayed
the theories of the once celebrated American in
their true colours And black hideous colours
they are, forsooth, as summed up in the con-
cluding sentence of Fitzy’s truly remarkable
work: “The title of “Progress and Poverty”
may be translated from American into English as
‘Humbug and Knavery.’ Alas, for poor George I
When we remember his position in the world’s
esteem ere the advent of the pamphlet, we cannot
refrain from paraphrasing Tom Moore’s lines:—
How vain was his boasting! Fitzgibbon has spoken,
And boldly declared him a ‘ humbug ’ and ‘ knave.’
One of the main distinctions between the
Government of the churches founded on “Bri-
tain's bulwark ” and that of the tabernacle which
rests on the metal plates of old Joe Smith of Utah,
Is that while the authorities of the former rule
their flocks by holding out terrible threats of an
overplus of fire in the world to come, the long-
beaded bosses of the latter keep their diselples in
check by still more fearful threats of a scarcity of
water in the more immediate world they occupy
at present. And the way the very much worried
saints of the Salt Lake put their dearly beloved
children through is this. Agriculture, in Utah, is
largely dependent on irrigation. The machinery
is owned by the church, and the bishops make it
their business to look after the temporal as well
as the spiritual welfare of their flecks. Therefore,
it comes to pass thar as the Mormon farmer lives
on a farm supplied with water which is under the
control of the Church, he is, in a remarkable man-
ner, well under the thumb of his father confessor,
or whatever they call their priests and parsons in
the language of the anti-Malthusiau land of Utah.
Now, anyone who is at all conversant with reli-
gion, as she is slung to-day, will at once perceive
that so long as this Goverument-by-water game
holds good, there is tittle fear of the pious old Salt
Lake divines being compelled to preach themselves
bald-headed in order to squelch the schisms caused
by the advanced thought teachings of the Tom
Paines and Bob Ingersols of the grand old faith of
Brighamy. For example. Bishop Jonathan Jerks
Is officially informed that at a recent meeting of
the Utah Plugugliee, Farmer Sisera Shyrtale flatly
declared that he diun’t believe an angel ever ap-
peared to Joe Smith at all, but that Joseph had
sucked the brains out of a bottle of prairie
poison, and was suffering from a mild attack
of the blind staggers, and furthermore, that that
sloppy old yarn about the Deluge was far too cool
for this planet at the present day. All this doesn’t
shake the Established Church a single jolt. No
special council of enraged ecclesiastics is hurriedly
called to anathematise the miserable heretic, and
with thedndispensible bell, book, and candle con-
sign him to a front seat near the hottest stove in
hell. The Bishop of the diocese simply sends the
offender a note to say, “Dear Brother Shyrtale in
the Lord, the revolutionary remarks made by
you at a recent meeting of the Utah Pluguglies
have reached and pained your pastor's ears. Un-
less a full and unqualified retraction is lodged with
me within twenty-four hours, your water will be
out off, and kept off until your eyes are opened to
a due sense of the enormity of your conduct. The
brethren will pray for you, but they won’t loan
you a billy of water even if your blasphemous
tongue sticks outas long as a ship s jlbboom. Bead
Paul to the Californians, 3rd chap. 4th verse, and
don't come hanging round, when your pastor's at
his meals. Yours in the spirit, t Jierks, Bishop of
the Holy Mormon Church.” 1 hat settles the job
at once. Brother Shyrtale Immediately grasps the
situation, and going down on his knees in the
market place publicly declares he was mad drunk
at the time he made his scandalous statements, and
that he is perfectly willing to believe Joe Smith
not only saw angels in his sleep, but that celestial
visitors used to frequently drop in and take pot-
luck with him for weeks: and, furthermore, he is
dead sufe there was a deluge, because he remem-
bers his old grandfather used to gab about losing a
brindled cow and a bull-pup in the general inun-
dation. 'i here is really nothing in the Scriptural
line that the repentant sinner will not swallow at
such a time as this; and we can. therefore, safely
recommend the Utah system of government by
water to the attention of Dr. Barry, and, in fact,
every other clergyman throughout the land. Fire
as a vice deterrent is played out, and nothing
ffights a,, man—especially a Rum man—to-day
much as water.

NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival us—blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result have they to show,
excepting- to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—in Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in New Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its name is really a household
word,
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
guaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO
can be hadron very easy TIME PAYMENT.
THE MIGNON PIANO
excels all similar pianos for first-class work and
richness of tone.

Rev. Father Wilds'
EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“ 78 E. 54 th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
Messrs. J. C. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen:
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that 1 could scarcely near any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly Improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles. I place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may'do good.
Yours respectfully, Z, P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from impure or Impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofu-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Rheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.

For a good old mixed or job lot of poli-
ticians, commend us to the present New Zealand
Cabinet, which contains two Freethinkers Messrs
Stout and Ballance, president and vice-president
respectively of the Maoriland Freethought Asso-
ciation: two Roman Catholics, Messrs. Buckley
and Tole; one Anglican, Mr. Richardson ; one
Presbyterian, Mr. Reynolds; and a Jew, Sir Julius
Vogel. Such a Ministry seems calculated to give
every denomination a fair.show fer its money;
but, nevertheless, it is one to which the question
of State secular education —should it ever crop up
ia likely to cause as much trouble as a bushel of
green gooseberrys in the “ turns ” of a whole Sun-
day-school crowd of youngsters.
This cheery little item fully explains itself,
and requires no comment from anyone. It ap-
pears that a party by the name of * Thargommdah
recently sent a perfect hummer of a query tci the
“ Answer to Correspondents ” editor of a Brisbane
journal, and that distracted gentleman re-
plies as follows:-" If the J.P. was drunk on the
Bench, you should report the matter to the
Colonial Secretary. Further, it is your duty and
that of the other gentleman, to summon him it he
acted as you state. Though, as he is the only J .P.
in the town, I really don’t see how he could be
summoned. Unless a man of his extensive genius
should sit on the Bench, 'hear his own case, find
himself guilty, and let himself off with a caution
on account of it being his first offence. Bather a
novel and difficult situation, is it net ?
A Melbourne Daily
Telegraph man has
been having a real old
drunk, and in a column
or so of the paper he
describes a congeries of
thoughts and emotions
■with which he was affec-
ted in his orgy. The
thoughts were terrlbie,
the emotions awful, and
he winds up with “ I am
haunted with fear lest
I shall be again led to
stray.” Now, is not that
genuine D. T. literature ?
Both delirium and tre-
mens are there.
Roma (Q.) was re-
cently the scene of one
of the most bang-up wed-
dings ever seen this side
of the equinoctial line,
and the preliminary fes-
tivities being through,
the happy pair started off
to their new home in a
buggy drawn by a pair of
showy, but evidently
oft-hearted, bloods. Five
miles from their destina-
tion, the horses knocked
up, and the disgusted
f room and blushing bride
ad to tackle the road and
tramp it. Finally, they
?:ot bogged, the bride
ost her wedding slippers,
and her tender little
ootsie-wootsies not being
used to the blistering
plainsof Western Queens-
land, she soon broke
down also, and the gal-
lant groom had to sling
her over his back at last
and carry her home to
love and glory. And
talking of this having set
Bobbie Byrne in a mus-
ing mood, he heaved a
sigh like a burst balloon,
and said, ‘‘Wonder
whether he’ll be so ready
to hump her in the sweet
by-and-bye ?” Of course
he will. The man who
wouldn’t “is unworthy
thd name of a Berritish
sailor.”
Says the Dubbo milk-
man who does the special
correspondence of the
Evening Slime:—“Pro-
bably one of the sights
of Dubbo is the neat
little garden of our es-
teemed townsman, Mr.W.
B. Morgan ; the large
number of pansies in end-
less colours (many larger
than a five shilling piece(
are a treat to see. Besides
these, are roses, ranimcu-
lus, pelargoniums, and
others, growing pro-
fusely, which make up
one of those pleasing
sights so rarely met with
in country towns.” We
have no remarks to make
on the above, except to
say that it is rather more
cleanly and interesting
than the rest of the drivel
and garbage which ap-
parently luggages the
sympathies of Alfred’s
35001 daily readers. And
again— how one thing
brings up another; castor
oil, for instance — the
names Morgan, ranimcu-
lus, and pelargoniums, re-
mind us forcibly of the
old lady who observed,
with a sigh, that there
was once a time when
she could remember the
Latin name of every
flower in existence, but
now, alas ! Time had
rubbed his sponge over
the red-leaved tablets of
her heart, and ail she
could think of was the
names of two—delirium
tremens, and the sweet
Aurora Borealis.
Granny’s bantling is rapidly growing a
sarcastic little cuss, and. If the old girl doesot use
the shingle more, there’ll be a heapof trouble in
the old home in Hunter-street. A late Echo, for
instance says: “As our readers are doubtless
aware, a Mr.T. W. Chambers, described as hon,
secretary to the River Darling Navigation Com-
pany,’ has propounded to the Adelaide Chamber of
Commerce a scheme for unlocking the darling by
locking’ it. The pun 1 8 not ours. Certainly not.
Echo puns, the world will crumple up
into chaos. The question, however, is not who
owns the pun, but where in thunder is it i
The Church Times remarks: ‘‘To say that
one is three may be numerically false, but there
are other departments in uature where it to tme,
and thus, when discussing the Nature of God, it is
absurd to suppose that we are bound by arith-
metical considerations.” Or,
any considerations of reason. The Church Times
gives, as an instance in nature, three
make uo one chord, hence “ three in one. But no
one pretends that each note is a chord. f
to the creed, “ each person by himself is God
and Lord,” and yet they are not three Gods but
one God.” We cannot say of the notes, each
note of itself is a chord,” and yet there are not
three chords but one chord." The Church Timfs
had better not be bound by musical considera-
tions in discussing the “Nature G°d. EqiiiUly
charming is the nciivctt of th© following.
sides, if we are talking of Divine Persons where
is the unreasonableness of conceiving of relations
like Fatherhood and Sonship which had no begin-
ning!” And where to the reasonablencsss of talk-
ing of fathers and sons at all, if the persons to
whom the phrases are applied are ooutemporane-
01*8 in point of non-beginning ?
Hear this hoary bit of muddy twaddle
that is going around again:—“In his sermon on
secularism. Dr. Steel tells the following anecdote:
“ When Napoleon I. was returning from France to
Egypt, some of the officers were discussing the
being of God. They were on the deck of the
vessel where Napoleon was standing alone. They
asked his opinion whether there was a God. Lift-
ing his hands to the starry heavens, he said ‘ Who
made all that?’” This reminds us once more of
how many religious teachers act on the notim
that on sacred subjects the very dregs of the intel-
lect are ample, and evidence on which they would
not stake a half-crown is perfectly admissible in
things supposed to be of eternal concern. What
grown man, for instance, cannot recall the ghastly
lies that used to terrify his youthful soul about
the last days of Voltaire and Tom Paine, and who
swallows them now, when it is known they died as
other men? Fancy the great Napoleon, a little
podgy bundle of brutal selfishness, sailing away to
carry massacre and destruction upan a helpless
race, and to cover a country with bleached bones
and drench it with innocent blood, being called in
as an authority on the existence of a God, to
whom, if He exist, the voices of millions of his
slaughtered creatures must then have been crying
aloud to avenge their death 1 And it is a Reverend
Doctor that hauls out this dubious old legend to
confirm our faith. We reverence not such reve-
rend reverencers.
This is the sort of thing that delves the
premature furrow into the eyes of a man who has
to read newspapers written by people who were
never credited with sufficient intellectual pene-
tration to master the preliminary attitudes neces-
sary to follow the occupation of a grave-digger.
A sporting writer has this time crunched out all
the human feeling we ever had, for he has under-
taken to enliven, to sparkle, and coruscate.
“ Hanlan finds that the Sydney ducks have cut
their eye-teeth;” “the Beach and Clifford crowd
have him on the rope;” “he struggled long and
warily to get the boulge in;” “ he first scoffed
terapin in Toronto,” and so on, paragraph after
paragraph. To what shall we compare the head of
the editor who permits this sewerage to rank as
light and lively and decidedly racy ? A turnip is
an honest ana Intellectual vegetable which we
weuld not insult by mentioning in this connection.
A boiled onion Is a hard-headed philosopher, and a
block would flare up in spontaneous combustion
to be brought into comparison. But we see this
mad wag by the eye of faith. Horsey coat, cut
tight round the hips, over-lapping masher collar,
tight enough to strangle a civilised man; pocket-
book sticking out of breast pocket, tight trousers
around legs bandied to imitate his ideal—the shank-
legged jockey. Cigar-smoke and slang coming cut
from under a cavalry moustache, very high-
beeled boots, and seven rings as thick as quoits on
his dirty-nailed fingers. “ Ha,” says the indescrib-
able editor, “dashing writer—witty, sir, witty!”
Oh, for a bludgeon made of a gum-tree upside
down I
The Bishop of Melbourne says that he
loves Jews. But he is careful to give his reason,
which is, that the Jews gave Christ to the world.
There it is, you see. Even the Bishop can t keep
the old Adam from asserting himself. His love
for the Jews is a clear result of evolution, as thus:
—The Jews, thence Christ, thence Christianity,
thence dogma, thence the Church of England,
thence the institution of Episcopy, ultimate de-
velopment —the Bishop of Melbourne Tib as
clear as mud. If there had been no Jews, there
would have been no Cbrist, no Christianity, no
church, no sects, no bishop. The Smouches, there-
fore, who may be inclined to cry, “ Grashus, Abra-
batnsh! vot a fine creechur that Bishop is, may"
reflect that the love and admiration which his
Lordship professes for them are derived from no
sense of their special worthiness to inspire either.
It is simply, “mafrensh,” because your ancestors
of Galilee gave to the world the founder of Chris-
tianity; the which principle, being distorted, and
prostituted, and polluted, gave to the world the
greatest outrage upon Christ s teachings—to wit,
man-invented Christianity,and thence bishops. It is
clearly out of all reason, opposed to even the
most cynical conception of the sentiment of grati-
tude, as influencing humanity, that a Bishop
should be indifferent to the claims of the Semitic
race upon his love and admiration. He owes his
position, his power in the Church, bis fat sine-
cures, his wages—all to the Jews. No Jews, no
Cbrist, no church, no bishops. Logical as a Krupp
gun. We like to get at derivatives, and trace
motives to their source.
As it has been found that the lowest-
known type of mammal—the Australian duck-
billed platypus—lays eggs like a bird (though it
subsequently suckles its young), and that the
structure of the egg is analogous to that of rep-
tiles, a high probability arises that all mammals,
including man, descend from reptiles, instead of
from amphibia, as has been imagined by the Dar-
winians. “The discovery is of value,” says the
Spectator, “ though it helps little towards the
ultimate question—the origin of life on this planet.
The existence of progressive energy in the original
germ is not the less wonderful because it was de-
veloped first through reptiles, Instead of amphibia.
How did it come there at all ?” This reptilian dis-
covery will, of course, be held by the orthodox to
chime in exactly with the Biblical legend as to the
events which occurred in the Garden of Eden soon
after the Creation. It must also be taken by the
unorthodox to explain the presence of so many
“crawlers” in this world. We’ve beard lots pf
old maids say that man has a deal of the snake in
him, and we’ve known a poet, when writing about
the women of his acquaintance, to savagely apos-
trophise them—
“ O Woman, allied t ■> l ‘ e serpent,
O Beauty, w.lu vcaj-u c.m jincdl”
Our opinion, after fully and ''e’iberately consider-
ing this matter, is that Adam and Kve and the
Devil were all Australians: that the Garden of
Eden was at Parramatta; that Adam was an abo-
riginal king or an old-man kangaroo; that Old
Nick was a big, handsome carpet-snake: and our
good mother Kve, “ who damned us all for a bite
at a golden pippin,” was a llying-doe, afflicted
with a kleptomaniacal habit of stealing apples and
“planting” them in her pouch. We commend
this piece of advanced and patriotic theology to
the attention of Pastor Allen. But we are rather
Inclined to believe that that reverend and learned
gentleman will sneak out of adopting our theory,
and will proceed to argue that man was made of
dust, thus—that dust became mud, that mud be-
came worms, that worms became snakes, that
snakes branched off into platypl and ceratpdi, and
so on, and that Anally the monkey stage (at which
so many teaphers of the people still remain) was
reached.
When we pencil out our little will, w#
shall certainly remember to insert a clause for-
bidding our remains to be planted up Forbes way.
And why ? Well, Just because the loved and
honoured dead have such a poor time of it in the
local boneyard. Directly that a decent corpse has
had some little tribute of affection placed on his
silent tomb, and begins to take a pardonable pride
in his surroundings, he gets all broke up, so to
speak, when he wakes up in the morning, or when-
ever it might be. to find that the scenic effects
which he had set his heart upon had vanished like
the baseless fabric of a dream, or something, and
that a barren, cold, and cheerless mound only re-
mains. And not only from the neighbouring
corpses are depredations to be dreaded, but in-
tending candidates join in the spoliation. This wo
learn from the editor of the local Winding Sheet,
who is an undoubted authority on matters of such
grave importance. The bright-hued flowers wnich
imparted an airy lightness to the somore and sug-
gest! ve mound in “ God’s acre ” at Forbes have been
transplanted to adorn the garden patch of a live
citizen; and it would appear that even the gravel
walk, which affectionate friends had formed round
the 6x8 allotment of another of the dear departed
had been surreptitiously removed and fixed up as
a parade ground for an opposition corpse. So long
as this state of affairs is allowed to exist in Forbes,
respectable and tolerably honest citizens refuse to
peg-out; and in consequence of slackness of trade,
the local undertakers are about to start a Grave
Protection Society to prevent what the local paper
calls “ Inhuman and barbarous robberies.” How-
ever, if we should te carted to Forbes (which the
saints forfend), we ask that the office bull-dog
shall be allowed to prowl round occasionally.
Pat. Ford had better
look closely after the
dynamite laurels of his
Oirish Wurrld, as there
is a new competitor in
the field, who apparently
hates the bloody Sas-
senach as much as he
does. The Decca Pbo-
kash, a Bengalee news-
paper, is the new candi-
date for treason-felony
honours, and part of its
recent chat runs : —
“ Foreigners have taken
possession of India, and
are sucking her dry. The
people of India look on
in a helpless manner.
Their best interests are
sacrificed for the benefit
of the English. Over and
above this, the innocent
natives are insulted and
killed. At every step the
people send up a cry for
succour, when the Eng-
lish whip or the English
kick falls upon them.
The demons are engaged,
heart and soul, in viola-
ting the chastity and
taking the lives of Indian
females. What a heart-
rending scene ! It is
matter of regret that the
people of India do not
gird up their loins to get
rid of the oppression of
white men.” Had that
lot appeared in an Irish
journal, the proprietor
would be snugly but
securely lodged in gaol
and his office sacked be-
fore he could sell a hun-
dred copies of his sedi-
tious sheet. God save
Ire —we mean India.
History tells us of a
French adventurer who
wormed his way into
society by treading on
ladies’ dresses and gentle-
men’s corns, and at once
apologising with such
grace and politeness that
3 managed to strike up
a most favourable ac-
quaintance. A similar
proceeding appears to be
attempted by the Nooze,
which barefacedly insults
a respectable citizen to-
day, and to-morrow in
sects a grovelling apol-
ogy. The only difference
is that, in the case of the
Nooze, most persons can,
without the slightest in-
convenience, put up with
its calumries, but few
can stand its excuses,
i o so great an extent has
this apologisiog habit
seized on the Nooze, that
it has actually started
publishing excuses for
faults never committed,
as was shown by a late
“ suckin edishun,” whic>
says: “In reference to a
re lent paragraph which
appeared in thesecolumns
in connection with the
arrest of the boy Thomas
Kooney in Melbourne, on
a charge of having stolen
Jewellery from Mr. Wil-
liam Alderson, it appears
that the victim of the
theft is Mr. Thomas Al-
derson. The incorrect
information was tele-
graphed to us from Mel-
bourne.” In Justice to
the poor devil who has
the misfortune to repre-
sent the Nooze in Mel-
bourne, we now state
that id the information
referred to he tele-
graphed, and the NoozB
actually printed the name
“ Thomas,” not "
liam.” This comes of
running an apology for a
paper.

The skirt of this elegant toilette of yellow virginie is trim-
med with two pinked silk flounces, and lace ones nearly
an inch deep going nearly up to the waist. The tunic is
richly pleated, and the place where the pannier is set on is
hidden by the front drapery. The basque bodice buttoned
before is trimmed with a lace stomacher arranged on a
stiff net foundation. Bunches of loops and ends of satin
ribbon.
The dress with the double apron drapery
exemplifies a pretty and ladylike toilette
of self-coloured wool trimmed with velvet
and coloured embroidery. Velvet trim-
mings which are now so fashionable, for
washing dresses, must be arranged so that
they can easily be removed when the
iatter require washing. The great
novelty of this dress is the way the front
drapery is put on —two triangular parts
falling over each other at the side. Kilted
flounces trimmed with velvet ornament
the skirt. The velvet stripes on the drap-
ery are four inches broad and the em-
broidery Corresponding embroidery
trims the bodice and sleeves.
