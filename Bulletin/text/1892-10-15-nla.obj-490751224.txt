Tales of the Early Days.
No XIII.— At Burford's Panorama.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
“ Ladies and Gentlemen,’-’ remarked the
Pnrfiord s Panorama, Leicester Square,
i eC Tn one afternoon in May, 183-, “ we will
I J ° nd ° k ’ you from the Old World to the New.
ut ve shown you the glories of ancient and
W !livn Italy, and have revealed to you .the
W nwv glaciers of Mount Blanc, the monarch of
SB ntains. Now we pass to other, regions—
W °‘ ns where, if travellers speak truly, beauties
Mature adorn the scene that rival Italia’s, where,
“J 1 h the art wonders which make Rome and
Terence the theme of admiring myriads are
Y there are to be found subjects not un
ab nrthv of the pencil of Michael Angelo, and
l pre if noble peaks bedecked in eternal snows
not penetrate the horizon, there are still Alpine
vTitrhts which are as grand in their cerulean
nect as Switzerland's mountains are in their
rb of purity. Ladies and gentlemen, behold
' ?hp magnificent harbour of Port Jackson, in New
3 nth Wales, with the beautifully-situated city of ,
on its shores—nursing,” no doubt, in the
rnnth of her existence, dreams of the coming time
Awn she shall rival Carthage, Rome—aye,
London itself.” ..
The lecturer, paused to allow the panorama to
mroll and*his turgid eloquence to sink intojFe
minds'pf Ids hearers. They stirred in their seats
with the restlessness which is hungry for a
Flayed delight. This ..was what they had paid
their shillings to see.- They knew all about-Italy
-and they were so sick 5f Mount Blanc—and
Paris on a paiinted transparency, even when lit up
with double-wicked oil-lamps,'is no particular
wonder. But Sydney ! That was something new !
Sydney was in Botany Bay, of coiwse, in the land
J kangaroos arid convicts, . where all the bad
people went to when the king' was too merciful to
hSng’em, and was right down the other, side of
the world, and the people stood on their heads
there and did other sorts of curious things, get-
ting up when we went to bed, and the savages' ate
them—“ they roasted Captain Cook, you know,
jear, at Botany Bay !” whispered a prim governess
to her charge—and, in short, the ladies and gentle-
men in the crowded, darkened auditorium trembled
fll oyer with pleasure as the panorama of the finest
harboufln the world stood revealed. All of them
—except two men, who sat almost the length of
the room apart. Both of them were present be-
cause they knew something of Sydney in the real,
and were curious to see what it was like in the
ideal. One, of short, thick-set figure, who sat near
io the transparency, gazed stolidly at it, careless
jf its beauties and alert only to notice its defi-
cienoes. And the other, almost a Jew in feature,
sitting near the door, did not look at the panorama
at all. His eyes were fixed upon the short man ;
studying every inch of the profile as intently as
the dim light would permit.
The lecturer began his detailed description of
the picture of Sydney. As became a loyal son of
Church and Crown, he pointed out, first, the
Churches of’St. James and St. Phillip, and then
the seat of Government, and became dramatically
vivid when he discerned—wonder of wonders!
Sovernor Ralph Darling riding out with his
private secretary and aide-de-camp, Captain
Dumar'esq !
“See, ladies and gentlemen, look at the two
brave dignitaries ! They are clothed with righteous
power and military costume. And, by way of
contrast, see this black-man dressed —I blush to
have to remark it, ladies and gentlemen—in no
more than a blanket and a cooked hat.” (The
prim governess cast down her eyes and bade her
pupil follow her example.) “ See this black-man !
He is the symbol of the time that is passing away !
He is King Boongaree—monarch of the Sydney
tribe, and now a pensioner on the bounty of the
Colonial- Government —if there is, ladies and
gentlemen, one thing more than another on which
England has a right to feel proud it is that of her
treatment of aboriginal races ! Obsesve how the
artist has painted the Savage King—how deftly
he suggests the epoch which is passing away
before the new erif of civilisation ! See, he lifts
his hat to his approaching Excellency ! He does
homage at-onee to the Representative of August
Majesty and to the Age of Progress !”
The orator paused to recover breath and win
applause. And the man near the curtain took
advantage of the opportunity to declare in plain,
audible tones that “it wor all a cokumed job!”
Then, encouraged by the surprise he caused the
audience, he went on : “ There worn’t no Boon-
garee or wot’s ’is name, an’ wot th’ cove ’ad p’inted
out as Sairit James wasn’t that at all, but it wor
th’ old dock church on'th’ ’ill, an’ wot ’e’d called
Saint Phillip’s war ak’shally Saint James’s, only
they’d turned it round th’ wrong way,! They’d
got th’ —— spire th’ wrong end. Th’ - spine was
th’ town end —not a-facin’ Park-’urds. W’y, for
two balls I’d paint a better picter myself !”
Then, modestly content with the success he had
achieved, the speaker sat down.
A*nd, not to deprive the man of his honours, we
must say that success was very marked. The
lecturer, who had lectured before crowned heads,
but who had never been lectured save by his
wife, was dumb with anger. Some school-
lads shouted “Hear, hear ! ” an elderly gentleman
hammered the floor with his stick, and the go-
verness was so tiekled that she overlooked the
necessity of instructing the little girl to put her
fingers in her ears at the “ naughty words.” But
had there been anyone to notice it, the most
remarkable tribute to the effect of the extem-
porised oration came from the Jewish-looking
fellow by the door. He chuckled, and chuckled
again !
Disdaining to comment on the interruption, the
lecturer proceeded. There was, however, less
glibness in his utterance, and he displayed a hesi-
tation that smacked of a doubt concerning the
trustworthiness of his information.
“Follow me, please, ladies and gentlemen,’’ he
went on, “ and notice the points and convolutions
of the Harbour *— —
“There ain’t no conwo-yo’call’ems,” interjected
the critic, who, unlike most critics, evidently knew
what he was talking about. “They’re all coves
an’bays ! ”
The lecturer kept his temper to admiration, and
proceeded. “ Here on this central point jutting
out perceive Macquarie Fort, built, as its name
imparts, by Governor Macquarie ”
“A good sort, old Looky ”
“ But having been designed by a civil archi-
tect ”
“I knowed ’im—old Green way.”
“Instead of an engineer it is erected in such a
situation and in such a style that it is rather a
picturesque object than a useful defence.”
“ ’Ear, ’ear ! Yer’ve got it right at last!
“ The fort stands on Bennilong’s Point, so called
from a house having been erected on it for the
residence of a chief named Bennilong ” ■
“Oh, Lord—who’s been a-kiddin’ o’ yer i
“ Really ” —the lecturer lost patience now—
“ really if the gentleman by the wall persists in
interrupting in this fashion, I shall be compelled
to have him removed ! ”
“ Well, I puts it t’ye, leddies an’ gents, is it fair
as ’e should be cokumin’ yer in a lot o’ damned
trash, w’en I knows better ? ”
“ Hear, hear ! ” shouted the boys. “ Angcore !”
cried the Jewish fellow (in a falsetto). “No, no
—certainly not! ” said the gentleman with the
stick, who ought to have known better. And
even the governess ventured to whisper to her
charge ; “ Oh, I wish he would go on—if—if he
would not swear so.”
The proprietor of the panorama was attracted
from behind the screen by the uproar. As a wise
showman, he knew it was his duty to humour his
audience, and proved himself equal to the occa-
sion by suggesting that his lecturer should be
allowed to proceed, but that afterwards the
gentleman from Sydney flight perhaps, if he
would be so kind, favour the audience with —er
a more particular description—er—of the beauties
of the harbour —er —-of Botany Bay. And the
gentleman from. Sydney generously agreeing, the
professional lecturer resumed with, it must be
confessed, something less of spirit and eloquence,
his oration.
“ I was saying, I believe, ladies and gentlemen,
when I was—when the gentleman from Sydney
was good enough to —er —speak to me that a chief
named Bennilong had his residence on that point.
I may be wrong, or I may be right, but such is my
information. He was the first native to become
attached to the settlers. He was brought to Eng-
land by Governor Phillip, and returned with
Governor Hunter. Although he was in a great
measure civilised, yet he could not altogether for-
get his former pursuits. For instance, he would
frequently discard his clothes, and pass several
weeks at a time with his old companions in the
woods ”
“ They all do it—they sell their breeches for
grog.”
The remonstrance of the lecturer was drowned
in the roars of laughter iroin the indecorous.
Everybody was indecorous, not excluding the
school-girl. . .
“ We will pass on. Observe this point, ladies
and gentlemen ! It is Dawes’ Battery —mounting
fifteen guns, and commanding the harbour. It
is, however, inadequate to the defence of the
town against any respectable force. This place
acquired its name from Lieutenant Dawes, who
sailed with the first expedition, and being charged
by the Board of Longitude to make observations
on an expected comet, erected his small observa-
tory on the spot. May I ask the gentleman from
Sydney whether that is not correct ?”
“ I shouldn’t be surprised if it war. But you
didn’t tell ’em that Black Sam wrecked th’
’Awkesbury passage-boat on that point. ’Owsom-
ever, go ahead, old cove —yer as slow as th’
Rosehill Lump, or Jim Hughes, th’ ’angman, wen
’e turned off ’is mother-in-law.”
“How slow was that?” questioned the old
gentleman, who must have been a disreputable
old gentleman, thus to set at defiance the routine
of a respectable entertainment. Certainly, he
was a humorous one.
“Well, I’ll tell yer, if so, be th’ leddies are
willin’, ven th’ lect’rer ’as slung ’is patter. Ga
on, pal!”
Glowering daggers, the orator proceeded. But,
alas! he was an orator no longer. No resonant
periods flowed from his lips. If the people wished
to be entertained by a vulgarian from Botany Bay,
well, they might. But, as for himself, he would
no longer cast his pearls before such swine. Ha
jerked out brief, unpicturesque sentences.
“This ship in the stream is H.M.S. Success.
Captain Sterling, who commands her, has at a
late date taken her round to the western coast of
Now South Wales to found a new settlement,”
“ New ’Olland, yer mean. The old colony ain’t
got a west coast!”
“An’ this ship, ladies and gentlemen—this ship
—or rather the hulk of one, perhaps ” —here the
speaker infused a palpable malice into his tones —
“the gentleman from Sydney would not mind
telling us what it is?” He pointed to a black
object depicted in mid-water off Dawes’ Point. It
might have been anything from a badly-drawn
island to a ship’s hull.
From his seat by the wall the interjector peered
at the painted canvas. The audience, made more
interested themselves by the accent of meaning in
the lecturer’s question, listened intently—none
more so than the Jew-like man by the door. His
heavy eyes glistened with his suppressed eager-
ness, and his nostrils dilated as he held his breath,
lie knew better than anyone there how pertinent
was that inquiry.
“Oh ! ” continued the lecturer, as the other did
not answer, “ I should have thought the gentle-
man from Sydney would have been certain to have
known that! That is the Phoenix hulk—used as
a place of confinement for prisoners of desperate
character.”
In the half-light of the hall it was not possible
to distinguish any alteration in the man’s features,
but there was a strangeness in his voice which
went far to convince most of those who heard him
that with his voice had changed his features.
The shock that dries the throat blanches the
cheek.
“That th’ Phoenix? —that faint th’ Phoenix —
th’ hulk didn’t lay there—she was in Cockle Bay
—orf Goat Island !” But somehow the assertive-
ness was out of his voice, and he was quiet while
the lecturer ran over the remaining features of the
harbour and the town. Possibly he would not
have again opened his lips, but have noiselessly
departed, when the lecturer closed the exhibi-
tion by a striking quotation from Darwin’s
“Visit of Hope to Sydney Cove.” But
the old gentleman and the boys, aided by a
falsetto from the back-seats, clamoured for the
story of Jim Hughes.
He began to speak from his seat, but the
audience called him to mount the form. And so,
at last, he stood and gave them the story of Jim
Hughes and his mother-in-law.
“ Yer must know, leddies an’ gents all, as Jim
Hughes was Jack Ketch in Gov’ner Macquarie’s
time. An’ Jim, though he warn’t so full o’ work
as ’e war later, did party well week-in an’ week-
out. Six-pun’ ten, in dollars, a-quarter ’e got,
an’ all th’ stiff-uns’ duds—l mean, leddies, as ’e
wor given th’ boots an’ togs o’ th’ free people as
wor turned orf—o’ course, Gov’ment pe’ple ’adn’t
duds to leave. Well, Jim married, but’s missus
died, an’ so ’e got ’is wife’s mother—she wor a lag,
y’ see—assigned to’im, that means, leddies, as she
wor to be ’is servant. But it happened that th’ old
woman got drinkin’, an’ she killed ’nether woman,
an’so she wor ordered ter be scragged.” As he
proceeded, something of the intoxication of public

thought as you wor a workman, not a damned
codger ’ —a savin’ o’ yer presence, leddies, she wor
givin’ ter naggin’ ’im a good bit, war Jim’s
mother-in-lor. ‘But/ ses ’e, ‘tisn’t nateral, is it,
I should be in a ’urry ter turn yer off ?’ ‘ Oh,’ ses
she, ‘ I don’t know as ter that! Yer never oared
much for me or my gal.’ ‘P’r’aps I didn’t,’ses
’e, ‘an’l don’t say as I did. But I’m slow now
as ’opin’ th’ Gov’nor may ’prieve yer ! I axed
’im !’ ‘ Like yer imperence, Jim Hughes/ses she,
‘interferin’ with wot ain’t yer bus’ness ! I don’t
want no ’prieve at yer ’ands !’ ‘I don’t care wot
yer want/ses’e. ‘I wants yer ’prieved for my
own pu’pose. If I turns yer orf ter-day I ain’t
got no ’ooman to whop !’* An’ that's w’y, ladies
an’ gents, Jim Hughes turned his missus’ mother
orf slow.”
“Didn’t she get reprieved, then?” asked the
old gentleman.
“ No, sir !” replied the Sydneyite. “ An’ ’tis a
pity, too. Jim ’udn’t get a second missus—it
’taint ev’ry ’ooman as likes Skeleton Jimmy—an’
as ’e wor wun o’ them sort as must ’av a ’ooman
to whop, to ease th’ temper like, sir, he took to th’
grog.”
* # *
A few minutes later the audience filed
down the stairway to the street. As the “gentle-
man from Sydney ” was passing through the door-
way to the landing a hand grasped his arm and as
he turned with a startled movement at the touch,
the full lips of the fellow who had been watching
him befit to his ear.
“An vat is the time o’ day with you, Sam
Jefferson, alias Dicky Arnold ? He-he! the
game’s up, Dicky !”
The man spoken to stared dazedly at the other.
The white terror of the hunted animal at bay was
for a moment in his face, but vanished as he strove
to carry off the incident in a braggart style.
“Wot’s your game, my covey ?—I ain’t no
Dicky Arnold or wot diyer call th’ cove as yer
named—er—Sam Jefferson neither. I don’t know
nothink ’bout yer !”
“ Vy, vot a dear innercent chap ve’ve got ’ere !”
returned the other, sardonically. “ An’ ye don’t
mean to turn yer back on an old Sydney pal,
Dicky, d’yer ? O, Dicky, Dicky, I’m kevite
ashamed of ye !—wantin’ to cut an old pal jest ’cos
you’re so big in yer shoes arter a-lectunn’ all these
city blokes an’ donnas ! ”
The gentleman from Sydney had now regained
his wits and his courage. “No more o’ this—
nonsense, or I’ll call a trap, an’ give yer up !”
“Vy, vat a b®ld bloke he is to be sure!”
admiringly exclaimed the other. “If he ain’t a
innercent, he is a tiptopper, an’ no mistake ! S’elp
me, I never ’erd of a cove vot vas frightened of th’
traps so, a-talkin’ so bold ! But if so be as ye
want to give me up, vy I’m villin’!”
By this time, the couple had reached the street.
The Jewish fellow’s arm had gradually tightened
round the Sydneyite’s, and though the latter made
one strong effort to escape, his capturer foiled it
instantly by twisting his leg inside the other’s,
“You bolt, Dicky-an’ I’ll raise th’ hue an’
cry ! An’ vere vill ye be then, my son? Now,
don’t be a fool, Dicky ! I ain’t goin’ to be ’ard.”
A light of hope shot into the Sydney man’s eyes.
“Wot d’yer mean, Izzy ? ’Ull yer square it ?”
“Ho, ho! Dicky, I’d a thought better o’ ye!
Ter go an’ give yerself avay, like a born fool ! Vy,
ye do know Israel Chapman then, arter all, d’ye?
Yer ol’ friend, Izzy—va,t copped ye at Parramatta
an’ sent ye to th’ Phoenix ! Vy, o’course ye knows
Izzy—yer ol’ friend, Izzy ! ”
“An’ wot if I does?” growled Chapman’s
prisoner. “ Anywun wot ’as wunst seen ver ugly
mug ain.’t a-goin’ ter forget it in an ’urry, neither!”
“Yell, veil,” quoth the notorious Sydney thief-
taker, “Ye ain’t too compliment’ry to yer old
friends, Dicky. But I’m goin’ to do pis’ness,
Dicky, pis’ness!”
“ Honor bright an’ above board, Izzy?”
“Yes, s’elp me, by Father Abraham, I am !”
“ Ye won’t take my money an’ then give me up,
arter all, Izzy?”
Ml Chapman looked genuinely distressed.
Vy, mine friend, vat d’ye take me for? I ain’t
Pounce !”
At the mention of old Pounce, the Sydney
forger, who did so large a trade in official
forgeries of all kinds, Dicky Arnold, otherwise
Sam Jefferson, started again.
“D’yer mean ter say as Po.unce ’as sold me ?” he
gasped.
“ I ain’t a-goin’ ter say nuthin’, mine friend—
until w { e skevares matters, or I gives ye up at
Bow-street perliee-office as a returned from trans-
portation cove.”
“ Well, Izzy, wot’s it ter be?”
Mr. Israel Chapman, over from Sydney on
“Government business in other words, com-
missioned by Mr. Alexander Macleay to ascertain
the destination of certain Sydney Commissariat
bills on the Treasury which had mysteriously dis-
appeared from the Colonial Secretary’s office,
Sydney, gave the insinuated proposal two minutes’
consideration before he replied.
“Yell, y’ see, there’s a reward for arresting a
returned from transportation man ’ere—that’s
five ! An’ then there’s the Sydney reward for
pickin’ up a Phoenix bolter—s’elp me, Dicky, that
lect’rer chap gave it ye pretty shai*p, all unbe-
knowin’, though, didm’the?”
“Go on! To with the lect’rer! If it
’adn’t been for ’im, ye wouldn’t ’a cotched me !”
“ P’r’aps I vudn’t an’ p’r’aps I vud ! But I vas
really in doubt till I ’erd ye tell that yarn ’bout
Jim Hughes ! Everybody in th’ old time knew
Dick Arnold’s story of Jim Hughes’ missus’
mother. ”
“ Go on ! go on !”
“ Don’t lose yer temper, mine friend ! If people
vat ought to keep ’emselves low vant to brag an’
show off, vy, they’ve got to pay th’ price of great-
ness, Dicky. Yell, then, besides, the Phcenix
revard is ten —that’s fifteen pun, Dicky.”
“ I’ll give it yer to let me go.”
“ Stay, stay, not so fast, my son ! I never does
these little friendly jobs except for double the
Gov’nment price.”
“That’s thirty pun—l’ll make it guineas !”
“ Ho, ho ! Vy, yer must ’ave a nice plant some-
vere’s, Dicky ! An’ then, y’ know, there’s some-
think for the credit—ye must make allowance for
the credit, Dicky ! Vy, dis would be a brilliant
capture ! Vot shall ve say for the credit, Mister
Arnold? Just a leetle bit of paper for twenty
quid ? Say yes, Dicky !”
“ I s’pose I must say yes if yer insist ’pon it!”
cursed the other.
“ That’s fifty altogether, Dicky. Now, I put
it to yer, Dicky, ain’t that too low for a service to
a friend ? Make it double, Dicky—say an’ underd
—an’ I’m blowed if I don’t let ye go ■!”
“ Square?”
“ Skevar !”
“ On yer honour?”
“ On the honour of a shentleman, Dicky !”
And, though Mr. Arnold paid the notes over
with a seeming reluctance, he rejoiced in his heart
that Lis unauthorised return trip to his native
land was to cost him no more.
“Tip us another tenner, Dicky, an’ I’ll tell ye
’ow I heard o’ ye being here !”
“No!”
“ Better ’ad ! The chap vat gave ye avay this
time may give yer avay again. An’ if ye gets
sent out once more—an’ ye’re bound to. Dicky,
when ye’re spent all th’ mopuses on the gals—th’
knowledge ’ll be useful!”
The contingency of another voyage across the
seas not being altogether beyond the limits of
possibility, Mr. Arnold, otherwise Sam Jefferson,
thought the outlay of another ten pounds only a
precautionary measure. So he made it.
“Vat de ye pay old Pounce for Sammy Jeffer-
sonjs certificate of freedom ?”
Arnold’s mouth twitched in angry surprise.
“ A tenner !”
“ An’ vat did it cost to ’ave Sammy Jefferson’s
marks tatooed on your buzzum ?”
“ Three pun’ ten.”
“ So this leetle trip ’ome o’ yours has cost ye,
wi’out your ship money, ’ow much, Dicky?”
“One ’underd an’ thirteen pun’ ten.”
“Now, ain’t that a nice sum to pay for trustin’
ol’ Pounce ?”
“ D’ye mean ter say ?”
“As Pounce gave ye ’way ? O’ course I do ! He
says to me, ‘ Izzy, ye’re going ’ome ! Yen ye’re
in Lufinun look out for Dicky Arnold vat bolted
from the hulk. I’m afraid he vent ’vay ’ —them
vas his very verds, Dicky!—‘on Sammy Jeffer-
son’s ticket. Dick ain’t no marks on his buzzum,
Izzy, but if yefind a Sammy Jefferson in Lunnun
with a mermaid an’ a ’nanchor in a true-lover’s knot
on his buzzum over S.J., that chap’s Dicky
Arnold!’ That’s vot ol’ Pounce said, Dicky!
An’ he vanted to go halves in th’ revard if I
cotched ye,! Yasn’t he mean ?”
“Mean? I’d mean ’im if I’d’im ’ere for ten
minutes ! ”
“ An’ look ’ere, Dicky. Yen ye comes out
again, an’ I’m in Sydney—an’ ye vants to make
another bolt, v’y, you send for me, Dicky. I’ll get
ye a whole pardon with th’ seal an’ all reg’lar for
vat Pounce charges for a ticket of freedom only !
An’ I alius acts ,skevare, Dicky—l never gives
no one avay vat deals honor’ble with me ! Now,
let’s ’av a drink, Dicky, for the sake o’ old times!”

Dear Bulletin,— The story that th
Maoriland Agent-General in London, Mr. Westbv
Brook Perceval, is a grandson of Spencer Perceval
the Prime Minister shot by Bellingham in th
Commons 80 years ago, is again revived. Them
is nothing whatever in it. Mr. Perceval is not I
grandson of the murdered man. A man of manv
experiences was Agent-General Perceval’s father
Westby Hawkshaw Percival. An Original Land
Purchaser, one of the first settlers under the
Canterbury Association, and afterwards owner of
a grog-shanty, then a cattle-dealer, small mail
contractor, bankrupt, and so on. He had his
failings and his virtues, but he lived and died a
Peroival, and was not the sort of man who would
endeavour to tack himself on to the Earl 0 f
Egmont's family even in the early days when
copies of Burke and Debrett were not so easy of
reference as they are to-day. As Percival the
deceased’s name stands on the list of Canterbury’s
first settlers ; as Peroival his name figures in the
list of bankrupts in 1865; as Percival-well, no
need to proceed. PercivaTs failings have not been
visited on his son, else would the latter not now
be Agent-General; neither would a Canterbury
constituency have elected him to represent it in
Parliament. But we all do wonder at the pro-
fessed Libera], the nominee to his present office of
the most Radical Government Australasia has
ever seen, allowing—to say the least of it—these
absurdly false claims to an aristocratic connection
to go without that emphatic public contradiction
which his official station would so easily enable
him to give.— Canterbury.

Dr. Kelly’s reputation is so thoroughly established that it will only oe necessary for him to intimate
that he is practising as a Specialist, to be appreciated as a benefactor to suffering mankijid. As the
greater portion of the New South Wales public is aware, Dr. Kelly is a Legally Qualified and Registered
Physician, and has by far the largest practice in the colonies. Many persons at a distance, however, are
unaware of his great success, as, hitherto, he has refrained from advertising. Hence, to widen the
sphere of his usefulness, he has determined, bynneans of advertising, to make himself known in remote
districts, where his reputation may not yet have travelled. As the question may arise, why does so
eminent a Physician as Dr. Kelly find it necessary to advertise, he may reply to one and all as
follows:—That the Physician who has the power to cure, and remains silent, is guilty of an un-
pardonable sin of omission; for if there is a person on earth to be pitied, it is he .who is obliged to
associate with his fellow beings while his mind is constantly harassed and tortured by the consciousness
of his past folly.

cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi?
patients, he has ' during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO

for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
YOU S DEBILIT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-

quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will

and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed

pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
| and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richardshas successfully treated
nearly 25.000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

The Futility of Strikes.
So far as can be judged from present appear-
ances, the prospects of the Barrier strikers
are most unpromising. The term “ strikers ”is
here employed in a merely conventional sense,
for in reality it is the silver companies and not
the miners who went on strike against the
agreement which they had both sworn to main-
tain ; but the word may as well stand. The
result of the present conflict, it is now almost
safe to predict, will be the same as that of the
great maritime strike, and most other move-
ments of a similar description during recent
years. The luck of the old trades unions has
turned since Capitalism has learned to organise
itself in opposition to Labour, and for some
time past the tide has run steadily against the
workers in every industrial dispute. What the
cause of democracy has gained during recent
years has been gained by legislation ; what it
has lost has been lost by such ill-directed efforts
as that whereby the workers of Broken Hill
sought to maintain their rights against the
huge silver monopolies of the borderland. The
cause was a good one—no cause could be
better—and the battle has been fought, and is
still being fought, with patience, endurance and
indomitable courage, but the odds are too great,
and Providence does not watch over those
who maintain a just quarrel. The strike
is" plainly an obsolete weapon, and pitted
against the organisation of Capital it is like the
bows and arrows with which the Bashkirs
sought to break the French squadrons at
Leipsic, or the ponderous muzzle-loaders which
went down in the wreck at Sadowa. It was
effective in its day, but its day has departed.
Moreover, it is the only weapon of the old
unionism, and the system which has only one
weapon is like the boxer who knows only one
trick, or the chess-player who has but one com-
bination, or the cast-iron strategist who moves
always on the same plan. The device may be suc-
cessful while its novelty lasts ; then someone dis-
covers the counter-move and it becomes useless
and out of date.
* * *
The disadvantages under which trades union-
ism labours are sufficiently obvious. It is not
powerful enough to force all the workers to join
its ranks, nor does it offer sufficient inducements
to attract them by other means than force.
There is always a large body of labourers out-
side its ranks who earn reasonably good pay
because the unions toil and struggle to keep up
a certain standard of wages, and who grab the
billets of the unionists when the latter go out
on strike in defence of their cause. The unions
necessarily fight the battle of these individuals;
the “blackleg ” profits equally with the unionist
when the latter secures a reduction of hours or
any other improvement in the general condition
of labour; he pays nothing in support of
the system which has gradually dragged
him up from a condition little better
than slavery; he never goes on strike in
defence of his rights—other men do that
for him; and when they are on strike he
plunders them for his own profit. Unionism
upholds the “ blackleg,” in fact, and so long as
this is the case, “ blacklegs ” will exist in
abundance. The resources of the unions are
spent almost entirely for fighting purposes.
No systematic effort has ever been made to
provide a fund for the support of unemployed
members of these bodies, therefore the unionist
who falls on evil days, and can no longer pay
his subscriptions, often drifts into the ranks of
the so-called “ free labourers,” and when the
next conflict comes, he probably helps to defeat
his former allies as a matter of mere self-
interest. The idea of forming, not a mere loose
federation of unions, but one solid body which
will be ready and willing to take in any and
every variety of toiler—the idea of endeavour-
ing to combine all Australia in one organisa-
tion, as absolutely homogeneous as the Society
of Jesus, or the Knights of Labour in their best
days before they drifted into too much gor-
geousness, has never been seriously attempted.
The full value of co-operation has not yet been
appreciated, and, what is almost as important,
the great virtue of Silence—and there are few
greater —is almost absolutely unknown among
the too numerous leaders of the proletariat.
* * »
The unions of Australia want to be welded
into one solid institution with one recognised
head—a silent man of the stamp of Parnell,
if such can be found, who will make no orations,
be interviewed by no newspaper correspondents,
have no confidants outside his own council,
consisting of men as silent as himself, who, if
he is defeated, will offer no explanation as to how
his defeat came about, and who will say nothing
when he is victorious. The central council and
every district or subordinate council requires to
conduct its deliberations in absolute secresy.
The associated employers do this already on all
occasions of importance, and therefore their
movements almost invariably take their oppon-
ents by surprise, while the deliberations of the
representatives of Labour are held almost in
public. The nefarious Habit of making speeches
wants to be abandoned, or, if the unionists
want speeches, some irresponsible elocutionist
ivho knows none, and therefore can betray none,
of the plans of the executive, should be kept on
hand to gush at large and entirely at his own
risk. The leaders of the Barrier miners are
now awaiting trial by reason of this un-
governable tendency towards turgid elo-
quence, and yet there is no reason to
believe that all this eloquence added one
atom of strength to the cause. When some
fiery orator can be found whose words will stir
the inmost hearts of the people and gather in
recruits by thousands, then he should be sent to
represent the interests of the people in Parlia-
ment, but oratory on the part of the members
of the executive should be suppressed with an
iron hand. Unionism is war pure and simple ;
the employers’ league and the associated
workers are hostile armies; and in war the
general who stumps the enemy’s country lec-
turing on his plan of campaign is a lost strate-
gist. Jefferson Davis did some such action
once, and the consequences are a matter of
history.
• # *
The history of most trades unions is very
much alike. There is a period of comparative
peace, and a certain amount—sometimes a very
large one—is accumulated as a reserve-fund.
Then there is an attempt on the part of the
employers to reduce wages, the fund is dissi-
pated in strike-pay, when it is exhausted the
strike collapses, and the laborious process of
accumulating a new fund begins again, and
when it is accumulated it vanishes in like
manner. The process pre-supposes that the
unionist will always be a mere wage-slave toil-
ing for an employer, that the weary, purpose-
less struggle between Capital and Labour will
go on for ever, with now a fleeting advantage
and now a defeat, but with no definite hope of
anything beyond. And yet the possibilities of
unionism, if consolidated under a few master
minds, are enormous. It might establish co-
operative stores in every important centre
which, being supported by all unionists, would
be able to sell below ordinary rates, and yet
made a profit to swell the funds of the organi-
sation ; while through their cheapness they
would gradually attract custom from outside
the unions also, and thus make the entire public
contribute to the cause of Labour. (A small
retail attempt has been made in this direction
at Broken Hill, but the enterprise was post-
poned until the day of adversity, and it is a
mere isolated effort which, by itself, is of
little account). It could advance from
this point to manufacturing and im-
porting upon its own account. It should
endeavour to have a hand in every pro-
fitable enterprise throughout the country.
When the first signs of trouble appeared at the
Proprietary Mine at the Barrier it should have
spent the funds, which have since been wasted
in maintaining a hopeless conflict, in secretly
acquiring the largest possible interest in the
great company, and splitting it up among a
multiplicity of small shareholders, who, by
rolling up as one man, and gathering proxies
from all stock-holders on whom influence could
be exercised, might have extinguished the loud-
mouthed Purves and the comparatively few
supporters of that blatant barrister who were
present. It might gradually secure a control-
ling interest in at least one of the large steam-
ship companies on the Australian coast, and
then, when the employers provoke another
maritime strike, its fleet could keep the sea
alone, and appropriate all the trade. It could
run large co-operative farms where every dis-
tressed unionist with his wife and family would
be taken in when necessary, and where he
would be required to work for board, lodging,
and clothing only, until employment could be
provided for him. These terms may seem
harsh, but they would at least bo a guarantee
that the farms would be a profitable invest-
ment, and when a strike became inevitable
those institutions would be a refuge for the
strikers, and prevent them becoming a heavy
tax on the funds of the union. And by these
and similar devices trades unionism would
eventually become a greater power in the land
than the mediaeval guilds of England, which
began to make and unmake kings in the fifteenth
century, until they were buried amid the ruins
of the Reformation.
* * #
This may seem a stupendous programme, but
The Bulletin maintains that it is absolutely
feasible. And in the end the consolidated
union would become the most potent capitalist
in the land, and its policy would lead to a
general system of co-operation, whereas the
present aimless device of scattered strikes leads
to nothing. But what is wanted first of all is
the master minds which can direct the great
scheme, and these can only be found by adopt-
ing a policy of secresy and silence. The present
system of gush and oratory brings only the
fluent speakers to the front—the men whose
declamation lands them in gaol at every crisis
when leaders are most wanted. If unionism
could be consolidated on some such plan as that
which we have indicated—a plan which, after
all, is no new invention, but merely an adapta-
tion to modern circumstances of a scheme which
achieved success years ago—it might control, not
only the Legislature but the country, and
instead of being a mere trades association, it
would be the nation itself. But at present the
Labour-party in the New South Wales Assembly
is the fitting embodiment of trades unionism in
Australia. It has no guiding spirit; its affairs
are supposed to be conducted by a loose and
shadowy committee ; and its plans and delibera-
tions are virtually public property. For want
of a visible head it cannot secure new adherents
so long as the nefarious system of Party Govern-
ment endures. The first essential of the pro-
mising renegade is a leader to whom he can come
in secret and ask, directly or by inference,
the one question which every renegade does
nsk—what his share of the plunder will be if his
vote and influence helps the party into power.
No politician in his senses ever puts such a
question to a committee, with the prospect of
his unsuccessful infamy being blazoned abroad
upon the morrow, and hardly any party politi-
cian ever changes sides except for the plunder
—therefore, the Labour-party remains feeble
and disorganised to this day. It might annex
one of the existing parties in a coalition, and
use it for its own purposes to wipe out the
other, but there is no one to whom or by whom
such a proposition could be made. The party
in Parliament and that outside are worthy of
each other. The former is swamped amid the
confusion of a frantic and contradictory system
of government. The latter potters along with
attempts at arbitration, which lead to nothing,
and with strikes that almost always fail,
because the capitalists, the landlords, the
Government, the military, police, “ free
labourers,” the wealthiest part of the press, the
squatters, banks, ship-owners and financial
institutions are all against it, and the odds are
too heavy. It could compete against them all
save the “free labourer;” he turns the scale
every time.
* * *
The primary misfortune of trades-unionism,
as already pointed out, is that it is a system
whereby one-half the community undertakes to
fight not only its own battles but those of the
other half, and that other half plunders it the
while. So long as, say, 50 per cent, of the
workers are willing to maintain the conflict
under the present hopeless conditions, it pays
the other half better to stand aloof. Unionism
has nothing to' offer them save the privilege of
paying contributions and of conducting a gallant
struggle against impossible odds. But if union-
ism were combined with a complete system of
co-operation, it would become a dividend-paying
institution, and “free labour” would be so
utterly unprofitable that, through purely
mercenary influences, it would presently be-
come extinct. This is doubtless sordid reason-
ing, but it is based on strictly business
principles. The mediaeval guilds frequently
held their own, in time of need, with the sword,
but the sword is out of date, and the guilds of
the dawning twentieth century must stand
their ground by their Consolidated Money Bags.
They must contrive to be in the aggregate the
greatest landlord, capitalist, and trading
corporation in this continent, and then the
blessing of that latter-day god—whose name is
Cash—will be upon them, and they will prosper.
A “Protectionist” Ministry.
So long as a Ministry professing Freetrade
principles held office in New South Wales the
cause of Protection marched forward with
powerful strides. It is very curious, but per-
fectly true, that the dissemination of Pro-
tectionist principles and the growth of a Pro-
tectionist party in that province arc, to a very
great extent, attributable to the bungling tactics
of the advocates of Foreign-trade. The daily
papers—notably the S.M. Herald —began it.
When, upon the refusal of Parliament—egged on
by the same influence—to endorse proposals for
taxation of property in any form, the Bibbs-
Jennings or Jennings - Bibbs Administration
resorted to the Custom-house for a five per cent.
ad valorem tariff for revenue, the Opposition of
the day, at the instigation of that section of
the press, betook themselves to crying out that
this was the thin edge of the wedge of Pro-
tection. Some genius invented the phrase
“sneaking-in” Protection, and thenceforth the
daily papers, without intermission, drummed
away at that tune. It was in vain that Bibbs,
Copeland, Lyne, Garvan and other Ministers
protested that nothing was further from their
minds, that a five per cent, ad valorem duty for
revenue was compatible with the sternest devo-
tion to Freetrade ideas, and that they meant
no departure from what was called “ the settled
policy ” of the province. The Herald, the
Telegraph and the Opposition insisted that
they were either ignorant or treacherous.
When at length Jennings, with a working
majority at his back, betrayed his colleagues
and his supporters, and by resigning broke up
the Ministry and handed the Premiership to
Parkes, that astute politician, with a dissolu-
tion in his pocket, saw his chance. He w
the country with the metropolitan
press, which had been sneering at . ,! ■ 5
for years, completely outwitted and nohhi?
By adopting their cry as his
for the general election, he
them to support him without reservation. 6d
• * *
The device was a master-stroke of policy Tl
very journals which had been for y ears persistently
reviling Parkes as a creature unfit f or ‘ y
public trust or public station found it necessn
to not merely swallow their spleen, but hur t
out into sanguine exhilaration at his appears,
in the role of a saviour. Parkes, by an adrni?
yet insolent, proclamation that everyone \vh
was opposed to him was also opposed to p r 10
trade, completed what the press had besun
The fretful remonstrances of the ex-Miiiistp*'
and their followers ceased. They gave up th ' S
protestations that they had not been trying tn
“sneak in Protection,” and were notProte°
tionists. With one or two exceptions thev
succumbed to the course of events and accepted
the inevitable. .that they were opposed to
Parkes admitted of no denial. To return t
the Assembly as Freetraders would be to accept
the humiliating position of ignobly swelling the
procession of his triumph. They threw off a
mask which they had never worn, and avowed
themselves Protectionists. Bibbs and F g
Suttor held out for a little longer. But on
the whole, the same fate overcame all the’old
anti-Parkesites, in and out of Parliament-
while simultaneously some of the old friends of
Protection, such as Abigail and Garrard
found it convenient to experience a blessed con-
version to Freetrade. Parkes and Freetrade
swept the constituencies. The Parliamentary
Protectionists were mere survivors from an
universal rout, without faith to uphold or hope
to console them. But in this lump of miserable
dough there was a fragment of leaven. J, p
Abbott had openly declared himself a Protec'
tiouist some time before the catastrophe. Mel-
ville and O’Sullivan had always been stout-
hearted apostles of the cause, and there was a
sturdy minority among the electors who had
held Protectionist views perhaps all their lives.
The Bulletin had maintained the principles of
the national cause. The Daily Telegraph
had been founded on the same fiscal lines, but
had failed to achieve commercial success, and
had later passed into the hands of Freetraders,
Ere twelve months had passed away, the public
had been disenchanted. The great Freetrade
Mokanna had promised that depression, just
beginning to be felt when he took office, should
disappear and be replaced by unparalleled
prosperity—as a consequence of a Freetrade
policy. There was no prosperity, and also there
never was Freetrade. Meanwhile, the Protec-
tionists, new and old, adapted and original,
took heart of grace, and began an active pro-
pagandism. The angry, scornful, vehement,
contemptuous comments of the adverse press
helped their efforts. It set people thinking
who had never thought before. The principles
of Protection to native industry found adherents
daily. At each general election since, the
Freetrade cause has shown a dwindling sup-
port, until after a balance, the scale definitely
turned towards Protection, although the sudden
inbreak of a Labour-party somewhat obscured
the fact.
* # *
It has been a curious fortune of war which
has thrown the leadership of the Protectionist
cause into the hands of the latest and most
reluctant of its converts.. That chance has not
been altogether fortunate for the cause itself.
One of its consequences has been the selection,
owing to natural affinities, probably, of a
Cabinet composed entirely of converts, and
with an embellishment of trimmers. Not one
of the old protectionists was admitted into the
Bibbs selection. His ablest lieutenant, Mr.
Barton, had been very tardy in giving his
adhesion to the cause at all, and his adhesion,
even after it had been gained, had proved far
from tenacious. One of the other Ministers in
the Assembly was distinguished by the extra-
ordinary suddenness of his conversion. He was
a Freetrader by conviction, and had no idea of
becoming anything else at noon, and he was a
Protectionist at 2 p.m. on the same day. In
the Council again, the Minister for Justice,
although a Protectionist of some duration, had
never stirred hand or foot to help the cause
during the four years of desperate struggle
which other men had waged on its behalf. As
for Sir Julian Salomons, he had, in a dilettante
sort of fashion, with the theory, but,
as for aiding, either by addresses or with his
purse, that had never occurred to him appa-
rently.
* # *
It has not been surprising that from a
Ministry thus constituted there should have
emanated a tariff of the most compromising
character. Inheriting from the two successive
Parkes administrations a financial difficulty of
the most serious kind, the Bibbs Government
allowed the necessity for extricating the pro-
vince from its monetary troubles to take com-
plete possession of its thoughts. It bad
£BOO,OOO of yearly revenue to provide in addi-
tion to current resources, and without any
clear perception of the radical distinction be
tween a revenue tariff and a Protectionist one
it concocted a mongrel sort of affair which 1
presented as a fulfilment of its obligations to it
supporters. The result has been just wha
might have been foreseen by anyone, and
indeed was appreciated and declared by Ml
Traill when the Tariff was going through the
Assembly. Presented to the province as an
embodiment of the Protectionist ideals, it has
been eagerly accepted as such by the r nee-
traders, who have been enabled to declare, an
have lost no chance of declaring, that aU their
predictions have been realised.
* * *
The broad result, however, has been to create
a re-action-against Protection. That cause 1
now less popular than at any time during tie
past five years. Unless the Government ta
heart of grace, and without loss of time reino e
the tariff, the prospect is that the
inclinations among the electors will tin
definitely against a policy for which so mu
has been claimed, and by which so little w
been accomplished. It is quite clear that


Treasury must have revenue, and plenty of it,
is times go. But it is incumbent upon men
entrusted with the weighty charge of in-
doctrinating people with the perception that
protection is not taxation, and that it does give
lomestic employment, to shun a revenue tariff
ag fc h e y would a pestilence. Every pound
sterling of revenue, so derived, indicates an
equivalent loss of possible local employment,
} e jse a draft upon the pockets of the con-
sumer, according as it is derived from duty
paid upon a commodity which can be locally
produced, or upon a commodity which cannot
be so produced. It is quite consistent with
preetrade maxims to levy a tariff—such as the
Dibbs-See tariff is in the main—for revenue.
Such a tariff imposes duties kept sufficiently
low to preserve to the foreign manu-
facturer his advantage in our markets and
not to discourage his trade with us. The
greater Lie volume of imports the more
productive is the tariff. But the moment a
duty is imposed upon a commodity sufficiently
high to deprive the foreign maker of his advan-
tage, it begins to foster and encourage local
production, and simultaneously the revenue
from it dwindles. Ad valorem duties are un-
doubtedly the very worst form of dealing with
imports which interfere with local industry.
They are liable to be defeated by the commonest
practises of commercial chicanery. European
exporters have, in the ordinary course of busi-
ness, to deal with protected communities all
the world over, and their arrangements are in
perfect working order. Double invoices are an
ordinary part of their machinery. Goods are
declared at half or even a third of their real
price, and while the invoices on the lower scale
are passed through the Customs and duty paid
on these, the importer receives a separate
invoice at the actual value, which he pays to
the seller. Specific duties render this device
welhnigh impracticable, although experts have
still to be employed by the Customs to check
frauds. It is the duty of the present New
South Wales Administration to thoroughly re-
cast the tariff, so as to convert it from a revenue-
yielding to a protective one, and to seek for
revenue by direct taxation, which shall dis-
courage land-monopoly and freely tap the
superfluous wealth of the fortunate classes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Queensland Exodus—Again.
The Tasmanian Democrat, following the ex-
ample of the Brisbane Worker, rises to
champion the “New Australia” movement,
and to anathematise The Bulletin because it
fails to appreciate that fatuous scheme. The
Democrat’s complaint is long and bitter, but
the gist of it lies in these sentences :
The article of Tub Bulletin places it very much in the
position of a person who has for years been preaching a
doctrine to a people who at least imagine they can see the
practicability of the lessons and desire to put them into
practice, and are coolly told by the preacher that it is all
nonsense—that his ideas were all utopian, and must not
be taken seriously. The Bulletin twits the leaders of the
above movement for deserting the cause of Democracy in
Australia before risking their all in an effort to upset the
present condition of affairs by force and bloodshed. Now,
1 have been a reader of the paper in question from its
first issue to the present, and I must say it has lost no
opportunity to point out to the workers the futility' of
resorting to arms ; now, why twit them for not doing it?
Besides, why, and for what reason, should they risk life
and liberty to bring about a state of things that would at
best take years to gain for themselves an extra spoonful
of sugar in their tea, while it might, for the proprie-
tors of The Bulletin, bring princely riches —while
they can at little cost, and for the trouble of emigrating,
get all that tends towards making life happy. The writer
of the article in question states that he has travelled in
many lands, and that there is no single advantage to
be found in La Plata which could not equally be found in
Western Australia, Tasmania, or Maoriland. It would
have been interesting to his readers if he had pointed out
from what part of Tasmania the company could have
obtained nearly half-a-million acres of fertile land free of
charge ; hut, of course, statements of this kind are to be
excused, coming, as they do, from an of a
company who views with dismay the anticipated diminu-
tion in their now extensive circulation. And the analogy
sought to be drawn by the same writer, wherein he likens
the intending emigrant, in the case of failure, to the
cheap Chinaman and Italian, is unworthy of a writer to
the journal who, above all others, should have been the
first to give a word of encouragement to those who, how-
ever much mistaken they may be, are willing to make an
attempt to put into practice the doctrines promulgated
by the Sydney Bulletin.
The above statements are partly misrepresenta-
tion and chiefly sanguine ignorance. The Bul-
letin did not say that Socialism was a utopian
idea ; what it did say was that Socialism could
be established in Australia as easily as in
Argentina. It did not twit the workers for not
resorting to arms against the Queensland Coali-
tion, but it said distinctly that they had never
tried conclusions with the Coalition either by
constitutional means—at the ballot-box—or by
force; therefore, they had never tested the
strength of the enemy from whom they were
flying so ignominionsly. If the Democrat can
controvert this fact it is at liberty to do so.
The Bulletin urged the workers to stay and
give a block vote against the Griffith Govern-
ment, hut it never did urge them to stay
for the mere purpose of organising a civil
war. The Bulletin never said that the
“ New Australia ” men could get 500,000 acres
of “fertile land” free in any Australian pro-
vince, but it distinctly asserted that they could
buy a site for their great experiment with the
money which they will spend in reaching their
alleged Paradise by the River of Silver. The
emigrants are not “ making an attempt to put
into practice the doctrines of The Bulletin
there is nothing in The Bulletin’s doctrines
about begging for free grants in South America
or any other country. But all this is beside
the main question. The only point really worth
controverting in the Democrat’s case is its
assertion that the Queensland adventurers
can, “ for the trouble of emigrating, get all
that tends towards making life happy.” This
is mere childishness, akin to that of the
British clodhopper who comes to London in
search of the streets .that are paved with
gold. There is no land on earth where any
man can get all that tends towards making life
happy, fl’liere is an awful scarcity of the things
that tend that way in Australia, and a still
greater scarcity in Argentina, where a land and
banking boom, six times bigger than that of
Victoria, has just hurst and left utter ruin
behind it. The men who propose to abandon
and betray their cause and their comrades in
Australia have hardly even a possibility of
getting anything for their pains. It is a case
of Judas apostatising in exchange for an
unsecured promissory - note; it is the dog
dropping the bone to reach for a shadow 8000
miles away. The only people who are likely
to profit by the movement are the members of
the Queensland Coalition. The next election
will be a close one, but if the “ New Australia”
scheme keeps on booming it will probably take
away enough voters to give the Kanaka and Land
Grant Railway party another lease of office,
and still another chance to fake the electoral
rolls, and restrict the franchise, and swamp the
country with Chinese, Polynesians, and other
paupers, and to gaol the Labour leaders for
sedition and the Labour members for breaches
of the new Griffilwraith standing orders,
and otherwise to further prolong their term of
power indefinitely.

Sauce for the Goose is Sauce for Uganda.
The situation in Uganda, East Africa, is
serious. The country was originally invaded
by good missionaries anxious to save the souls
of its benighted inhabitants and prevent their
being enslaved outside the mission. The next
step, of course, was a pious hint to pious
pundits of Exeter Hall that there was money
in it, and a company was floated promptly to
encourage the development of Christianity and
the blessings of trade—no, it was the blessings
of Christianity and the development of trade—
within these regions. The saintly promoters
got their usual parcels of paid-up shares, of
course, and other saintly, but much greener,
brethren found the money for the blessed spec.
It was calculated that the enterprise would
speedily yield 30,000 souls snatched from
damnation and 35 per cent, per annum on, in
filthy lucre, the nominal capital. Things have
proceeded in the usual fashion. Calico and
Bibles formed the staple imports at first, in
exchange for ivory and souls mostly. But a
disturbing factor presented itself in the form of
a Papal mission which saved souls at a large
reduction on Exeter Hall rates, and gave more
calico for a tusk. The Rev. Mr. Chadband at
this stage took a back seat, and Captain
Lugard made his appearance. The native
“ Protestants ” were invited to lay down their
Bibles and fight the devil with Winchester
rifles. This they have been engaged in doing
ever since with more or less success, till lately
Satan seems to have been getting the upper
hand and has captured two Gatling guns from
the Lord. The London Times npw chips in
with the painfully candid remark that the real
question at issue is who shall save the —souls?
Not at all—the territory ! And the Daily
News, nearly as bad, remarks that enough
British money and blood have been lost over
Uganda, evidently meaning that the soul-saving
speculation has left a deficit somehow. But
the British Church Missionary Society, which,
somehow, is behind the British East Africa
Company, refuses to withdraw from work in
•Uganda, and evidently takes it exceedingly ill
that Lord Rosebery, the new Foreign Sec-
retary, shows a distinct indisposition to send
along an army corps to help to spread the
Word. And—to conclude—a ribald foreign
newspaper, the Berlin Yossische Zeitung,
offers the opinion that the British people are
weary of the missionaries and their troubles.
The Zeitung is probably correct. So long as
missionaries started out with their staff and
their scrip and took their martyrdom meekly,
the British people tolerated and rather admired
them. But the sort of missionary who won’t
think of marching without a caravan conveying
tinned provisions and an ice-making machinej
and who howls for a British army every time
that a large black negro king refuses to turn
off all his 70 young wives and content himself
with the withered skinful of bones who repre-
sents his first spouse, makes the British people
feel tired.

The history of the Victorian prospecting-vote is
utterly damning to that system of jobbery and
robbery. In the last six years £480,000 has
been paid in subsidies to gold-mining com-
panies, on the understanding that where the
grant produced a successful result it would be
repaid to the Government. Fourteen “ suc-
cessful ” companies have repaid less than £3OOO
in the aggregate—about one-seventh of the
total amount they drew from the voce. The
remaining £477,000 has been swallowed up
either by the hundreds of hopeless shaft-holes
in which no gold was discovered, or by syndi-
cators who have added the State’s bonus to
their small profits, and said no more about it.
At its best the prospecting-vote puts a few
industrious men on the land to produce abso-
lutely nothing for their toil, and at its worst it
may be said to help pay for tickets taken by fat
speculators in underground lotteries. Gold-
seeking is the one Victorian industry that re-
quires no encouragement, even if it were honest
encouragement—from the Government. Already
there are too much mining, too much scrip, too
many stockbrokers in the country. It’s atop of
the land that the money ought to go just now ;
£BO,OOO a year spent in utilising the wilderness
and promoting the growth of farmers for the
past six years would have produced a gold-
mine guaranteed to yield money till the Crack
of Doom. The spectacle of an insolvent Govern-
ment supplying the country with coin to invest
in a ghastly uncertainty is ludicrous, even
when the uncertainty has a reasonable chance
of coming off. These mines, supported by the
Prospecting Vote, never land a good stake for
anybody, seemingly, and the Government’s
“ stuff” might as well be piled on three-legged
horses for the Melbourne Cup.
Premier Tomuel Griffilwraith on payment
of members :
There is reason to believe that there has sprung up in
many parts of the Australian continent a class of persons
to whom £3OO a year is a much greater amount than they
could ever expect to earn by the exercise of any calling
for which they were naturally fitted, but who, with a
faculty for talking glibly, have seized the opportunity of
getting into Parliament and making a much larger in-
come. That was the objection pointed out; it was always
a real one, and for my part I always objected to the pay-
ment of .£3OO a year, because I always maintained that
whatever payment was given, it ought not to be such a sum
as to induce people to come into Parliament for the sake
of the salary.
Which, when boiled down, comes to this : (1)
No man should receive more at any calling
than he could make at some other calling. For
instance, Griffith shouldn’t get more as
Premier than he could make at the Bar, and ho
shouldn’t get more at the Bar than he could
make at carrying bricks, and he shouldn’t make
more at carrying bricks than he could make as
a black-tracker. (2) People shouldn’t come
into Parliament for the sake of the salary.
They may be Ministers, judges, barristers,
parsons, squatters, land-grabbers, members of
swindling syndicates, Kanaka - stealers, and
everything else beneath the sun for the sake of
the salary—-in fact, every man is something or
other for the sake of the salary ; but they must
be legislators out of a pure and holy desire to
get a railway made through their own pro-
perty, or to float a land-grant railway at the
public expense, or for some equally noble
emotion.
—-♦
At the instance of Willis, M.L.A., a Bill has
been read for the first time in New South
Wales Assembly providing that “no person
shall conduct, drive, or in any way use any
camel within the boundaries of any municipality
in New South Wales.” Willis’s constituents,
as we have already noted, object to the camel
—the most useful animal that was ever intro-
duced in the dry regions of Australia ; more
useful a hundred times than the horse or the
bullock—because it is generally driven by an
Asiatic. They are too conservative, in their
own dreary way, to adopt the camel themselves
while abolishing the Asiatic, who is the really
objectionable member of the pair—or else, per-
haps, the idea never occurred to them. It all
reminds us very much of that British law of 30
years or so gone by, which provided that no
steam motor should traverse any street unless
a man ran 100 yards in front of it with a flag,
the motor itself not to go more than five miles
an hour ; and of that old Tory party which
wanted to prohibit the locomotive because it
would scare cows to death ; and that ancient
English enactment that any man who burned
coal in London should be hanged, because the
smoke of the obnoxious fuel would kill off all
the inhabitants. Also, the idea of legislating
against the camel because of the Asiatic driver
is very much like the Chinese inspiration of
burning the house down in order to roast the
little pig for dinner.
Thus Renan in the “ Life of Jesus ” upon the
party of “ Law and Order ” :
“ Better the death of one man than the ruin of a
people.” In our opinion this reasoning is detestable.
But it has been that of Conservative parties from the
commencement of human society. The “ party of order ”
(I use this expression in its mean and narrow sense) has
ever been the same. Deeming the highest duty of Go-
vernment to be the prevention of popular disturbances it
believes it performs an act of patriotism in preventing,
by judicial murder, the tumultuous effusion of blood.
Little thoughtful of the future, it does not dream that in
declaring to be against all innovations, it incurs the risk
of crushing ideas destined one day to triumph. The
death of Jesus was one of the thousand illustrations of this
policy. The movement He directed was entirely spiritual,
but it was still a movement; hence the men of order,
persuaded that it was essential for humanity not to be
disturbed, felt themselves bound to prevent the new
spirit from extending itself. Never was seen a more
striking example of how much such a course of pro-
cedure defeats its own object. Left free Jesus would
have exhausted Himself in a desperate struggle with the
impossible. The unintelligent hate of His enemies decided
the success of His work and sealed His divinity.
The cable has, of late, taken to transmitting
poetry, instead of adhering to plain, prosaic
lies as it used to do, and the result is unsatis-
factory. A sub-marine cable can’t be poetic ;it
isn’t built that way. Witness the following
slab concerning the death of Tennyson :
Sir Andrew Clark, who was with the Poet Laureate
when he died, says that his face was gloriously beautiful
at the moment of death. The room was unlighted, but
the moon streamed through the windows on to the poet’s
face.
This is most pitiable. It is a ghastly
thing that the poetic genius who wrote such
works of eternal beauty as “In Memoriam,”
“ Locksley Hall,” and “ Crossing the Bar ”
should be hardly cold before Parkes starts to
grind out “Reminiscences” about him, and
second-rate men of gush proceed to cable out
fifth-rate maunderings concerning the manner of
his decease and the moon. The picture of the
poet and the moonlight isn’t much of a picture
in any case, but such as it is it should have
arrived here softly and gradually by mail,
instead of being dumped down as a solitary
item breathless with speed and red-hot with
haste. Also, it should have been edited by a
poet. The moon, pale Cynthia, is the special
property of poets, and was created in order
that it might cast mysterious shadows athwart
the velvet turf, and pencil out strange imagery
on the mountain side when the bard walks
abroad hunting for a rhyme. The bard gets his
victuals out of the moon ; it composes his stock
in trade, tools, fixtures, fittings, utensils, and
provender. An American poet once recognised
this fact and started a grateful ode as follows :
Now that Tennyson is gone the hew Laureate
—Swinburne, most probably—takes over the
moon with the rest of the properties, and any
unauthorised persons found fooling with it in
prose will be prosecuted.
It is full time that the members of unions
throughout the country should recognise the
fact that there is now not a flicker of hope that
Union labour can win at Broken Hill. The
strikers are definitely defeated, and are merely
consuming the savings and weekly levies of
unions and unionists in other places without
any advantage to the common cause. The
loyalty of unionists generally has been so
splendid that it is a shame that it should be
imposed upon as is now the case. The
Northumberland miners are, in some cases, not
working many days in the month, yet every
pay they get they tax for the Broken Hill men
who stood by them so grandly during their last
trouble. But it is all useless self-denial now.
The real trouble to be provided for is not the
support of the Broken Hill strike, but relief for
the unemployed unionists at Broken Hill.
That is very nearly the reality now, and it will
be all the trouble very speedily. The end of an
unsuccessful strike is the most dreadful of
times, and it would be atrocious to hold out
against reason, so long as a pound is left in the
unionist lockers, and then collapse when relief
for the women and children could not be pro-
vided.
In Sydney Daily Telegraph, “ Faustine,”
who has been visiting N.S.W. Assembly during
the motion of censure, asserts that women as
public speakers are more in earnest than men,
more magnetic, more coherent, and les§ in
danger of wandering into side issues.
“ Faustine ” also says she has heard very many
good woman speakers, in Australia and elsewh er e.
We’d like their names. Apart from Annie
Besant, the writer has scarcely heard a lady
speaker who did not either repeat a lesson got
by rote, without stop or inflection, or read in
monotonous tones from MS. a laboured para-
phrase of other people’s thoughts. Perhaps
women do wander less into side aspects, but
that is no proof of good speech, but simply of
blind partizanship. The good speaker is one
who sees not only his or her own side of a ques-
tion, but every facet that may be illuminated
by an individual opinion, antagonistic, or other-
wise. These, he or she will attempt to make
use of on the way to a logical conclusion.
Take Gladstone’s parenthetical talk as an
instance. As for Sydney’s lady speakers, let
anyone who wishes to make a comparison visit
a Woman’s Suffrage meeting, and if the dullest
male spouter doesn’t outshine the women it is
because he is abashed by the audible manner in
which they are criticising the sit of his
“ trousaloons,” his oratorical style and gestures,
his “shambling” walk, like “the flop of a
seal,” to quote “Faustine,” or counting the
hairs that surround his bald patch. When
“Faustine” has caught and caged her good
woman speaker it will be time enough to
commence depreciatory comparisons.
“ I value far more the approbation of
Radicals than that of all the emperors and
empressses, kings, queens, lords and lick-spittles
in the universe So that the good
ship Democracy sails prosperously into Joppa, I
care not whether my berth is in the officers’
quarters or in the forecastle. Jones or Jonah, it
is all the same to me, and if I thought that my
being thrown overboard would render the success
of the voyage more certain, overboard I would go
with pleasure—all the more as I can swim.”—
Labouchere,
Australia (writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent) can at least boast of a native-born
peer, Mr. Cyril Blower, who has just been raised
to the Peerage of Great Britain as Lord Battersea,
was born in Australia and is the eldest surviving
son of Mr. Peter Flower, of the firm of Marsden
and Flower and subsequently of Flower, Salting
and Co., which was in existence in Sydney until
very recent years. Mr. Flower, after retiring
from business in Australia, came to England and
invested money in the purchase or lease of a large
amount of land in Westminster, which was then
occupied as drying-grounds by laundresses, and
also in Battersea, which was then almost a wilder-
ness. His foresight and the unearned increment
has made his sons very rich indeed. Two of them,
after being known for years as fast men about
town, died, leaving their money to Cyril, thus
adding to Ids wealth. One of the sons, Horace,
paid more than one visit to Sydney, and he once
rode a steeplechase at Randwick, and won on
Fred. Want’s old horse, Sir Watkin. Peter
Flower, another brother, was one of the co-
respondents in the Dupplin divorce-case, and was
otherwise known as a speedy young man and a
great gambler. Cyril Flower, the new peer,
married a daughter of Anthony do Rothschild,
with whom he received an enormous dot.
Soon after being elected to the Commons he
attached himself to Gladstone’s fortunes, became
one of the Liberal whips, and duly received his
reward as aforesaid by being kicked upstairs. He
is a very handsome man, though now showing a
slight amount of embonpoint, which somewhat
detracts from his beauty. He is a straight rider
to hounds, and about three or four years ago won
the Parliamentary Point to Point Steeplechase on
his horse Home Rule, but was disqualified as much
by reason of his horse’s name as from the fact that
the animal had previously competed unsuccessfully
in some regular steeplechase. Lady Battersea is
very fat and at least forty. She is a charming
hostess, and entertains splendidly in her house
opposite the Marble Arch, which is one of the
swagger mansions of London. Singularly enough,
just as Mr. Cyril Flower has become one of the
old nobility, it is announced that Miss Salting, a
granddaughter of Mr. Salting, of Flower, Salting
and Co., is to be married to Lord Binning, eldest
son and heir of the Earl of Haddington. \Ve

All hail, thou glorious moon,
Bright as a new tin-can,
Thou fairest, purest, roundest source

Cares.
Having certain cares to drown
To the sea I took them down :
And I threw them in the wave.
That engulfed them like a grave.
Swiftly then I plied the oar,
With a light heart, to the shore.
But behind me came my foes ;
Like a nine-days’ corpse each rose
And (a ghastly sight to see !)
Clutched the boat and girned at me !
With a heavy heart, alack,
To the land I bore them back.
Not in Water or in Wine
Can I drown these cares of mine.
But some day, for good and sure,
I shall bury them secure
Where the soil is rich and brown,
With a stone to keep them down,
And, to let their end be known,
Have my name carved on the stone j
So that passers-by may say,
“ Here lie cares that had their day,”
And, sometimes, by moonlight wan,
1 may sit that stone upon—
With a spectre’s solemn phlegm—
In my shroud and laugh at them ;
Or—who knows, when all is said—•
Maybe weep because they’re dead.

816 Macquarie-stroet North, Sydney, Oct. 12, 1892.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
During the annual sports at N.S.W. Boys’ School, the
Other day, some ratlver scedy-looking people got into a
space, reserved for the better-dressed, right under the eye
of a man in blue accompanied by a cattle-dog. To clear
the sacred patch Policeman X actually set Toby on to the
intruders who jumped like kangaroos w ben they felt the
dog’s cold nose on their heels. But if tykes are so clevei
at police-work perhaps lawnorder might be preserved at
the low price of a quantity of dogs’ meat at slated in-
tervals,
1 haven’t yet quite got over the effects of tire hilarious
crowd on the floor and in tire galleries, tlie perfect music,
the snoozy corners, the masses of beautiful flowers, that
helped to make the plain and costume hall in aid of
North Sydney Hospital, the crowning success of a season
of successful charity hops. The ladies’ comrmttee(largely
assisted by men) had worked most energetically. The
supper-tables were supplied by the ladies, who boasted
of having cooked most of the victuals with their
own lair hands, hut with the exception of one load of
Gharlotte Russe, which an eye-witness swore to having
actually seen in course of evolution at Manly, most of the
cookery was of uncertain origin, and I’m ready* to wager
there were more cash contributions than amateur cooks.
The inevitable pupils’ dance afforded pause to notice
that nearly every matron—Lady Jersey, in white brocade
with sapphire ornaments, included—sported the new
“ handful ” bouquet, the very latest floral caper for
married woman after sunset, I can’t say I like ’em ; they
suggest that the bearer has taken a hasty, unconsidered
dive after them over somebody’s back fence. Lady
Charles Scott-in spring-green merv and crushed straw-
berry brocade with shoulder-flounce of drab lace—sported
a very choice bouquet with floral streamers, presented by
the committee to her as president.
Lady Innes’s plainly-cut, grey merv, with a suggestion
of silver-spangled braid, was ** woken” up by a vermilion
ribbon on her fan. Mrs. Mailler-Kendall had one orimson
rose to accentuate her dreamy frock of white brocade,
crepe and silver gimp; Mrs. Edward Jenkins wore a
pucker-frock of strawberry brocade, with green sleevelets
and lines of black jet; Mrs, VV. Mitchell, in white brocade
and moire, diamonds, and a mauve and white bouquet,
took the trick ; Miss Elsie Josephson was well turned-out
in white brocade and chiffon ; Mrs. Garvan wore black
ottoman silk and lace and Jet butterflies, and carried a
huge bouquet; Mrs. Mayoress Manning, in white silk,
lightly picked up with jet and pale-blue ruchings, brought
her daughter in a baby-frock of white and snowdrops.
Miss Darley’, in pink, trimmed with daisies and grass, had
rather an infantile effect, too,
I’m sorry to say that the “Queen’s Fund ” (in aid of the
distressed women Who go to church and rise for the
national anthem) ball in Sydney Centennial Hall, on 4th
inst., was—well, a very marked contrast to the first one,
which little Lady Carington worked up so successfully in
’9O. Several things were out of joint, besides a small
tho’ creamy attendance. There were neither powder nor
pins In the ladies’ room ; the band had original ideas on
the subject of waltz-time ; and the belle of the floor (in
white and green) had a foot of unmistakeable soil round
the edge of her train. There were no new frocks sported.
Lady Jersey resurrected cream satin and embroideries;
Lady Scott wore grey and black velvet and chiffon. Miss
Bnrdekin was a success iii one of the new gaudy gowns
which somehow don’t look the least bit vulgar when pro-
perly put wp. Hers was a brilliant yellow, draped with
bright mauve chiffon, and trimmed with bright myrtle
and gay green leaves. But another vivid toilet of pea-
green, aggravated by old English pink, had missed the
secret somehow, and acted on one’s retina like grit
between the teeth. By the way, rather a vivid: incident
was when a dashing militaire in spurs—why on earth
should men dance in spurs?—went headlong on top of. a
society belle in the mazy waltz.
At a recent Sydney public hall, Viscount Villiers, heir
of the house of Jersey*, stayed long after pa and ma and
suite had got hack to the Domain—quite prepared to shake
a lordly leg to further orders. But all the very best
society girls had fled in the vice-regal footsteps, and there
wasn’t a partner left for His Ex.’s heir, who moped
among the festooned pillars like a spook in full war-paint.
By the way, the V.R. Viscount is reported to be ever so
much cuter than he looks. Voyaging out this way, not
one of the usual herd of card-sharpers could catch
“ Villars ” over even the most complicated poker.
Yes, Viscount Villiers is a staid youth—when his
mother’s looking, At the Fund ball he sat and twiddled
his thumbs on the dais when he wasn’t pacing through
squares with committee dowagers. But when mama had
Vanished—Ta-va-ra-Boom de-ay !
The show of N.S.W. women’s work for Chicago
“Exposition” (why not Exhibition?) opened in Sydney
Town Hall, last Saturday afternoon, with a live Q.C.
giving back too much change as “honorary” doorkeep.
Lady Jersey—got up in ripe-fig tints, with a sprig of
wattle in her little bonnet, and seemingly quite recovered
from her recent cold -set the affair on its feet and stayed
for some time flitting hither and thither ; but I must say
tb it some of the committee hardly showed her courtesy.
For instance, I have a vision of two ladies skimming along
to show in’ lady something special, and M.E.J. putting
on a terrible spurt to catch up to them as they tore
ahead!
You couldn’t he a Daniel come to judgment amongst
the women’s work, because you were told that “ half the
things weren’t unpacked,” if you became unmanageable
in front of, say, a gaudy square done over with needle-
worked Australian flora, showing the red epaeris tipped
off with bright yellow instead of white. I couldn’t see
the trans-Paoifio force, either, of a not-astonishingly well-
modelled tweed frock, trimmed with fur—nor did a
dejected pink tea-gown, with no par’ticlar points of colour
or cut, appear quite eligible to represent the outward
aspect of our looser moments.
Of course, everything in the Centennial Hall isn’t going
—if it did, Chicago might return Sir Dibbs’ strong
language. One or two lace shawls show marvellously
fine work ; flowers and butterflies, made of fis'.i-seales, are
queer and clever-looking. I fell in love with a group of
real-looking little cows, covered with ealf-liide and ex-
cellently modelled ; of simple and compound needlework
(plain and fancy), there were cases and eases. But there
isn’t much thrill about hems and tucks—at least, not
when they’re folded up under glass-so, after inspecting
Nurse Gould’s clever improved mattress for invalids,' I
escaped into the art section. From which, however, I
emerged unmoved, only hoping that if the committee will
s-nd a rather dashing-looking horse’s head in oils, they
will write another tag. 1 don’t suppose the ocean steamers
charge for an apostrophe as freight.
There was a “society ” attendance on half-crown day.
Lady Charles Scott, in grey corduroy trimmed with black
lace and moire ribbon and a spray of myrtle in her bonnet,
came with the Admiral and her sister, in tan and brow n
velvet, black hat trimmed with pink roses. Lady Dibbs
(Sir George came, too, and countenanced the thing, so he
really couldn’t have said it, after all !) in a black velvet
and silk mantle and a band of yellow roses in her bonnet,
bunted with Miss Burdelt-Sniilh, in stylish black, and
Mrs. Colonel Spalding, quite dashing in black and yellow*
Also, Mrs. Mailler Kendall cut a picturesque figure in
fawn worked up with pink silk covered with black lace,
w ide black hat covered with roses. The music was very-
gay and suitable during the day, but the refreshments
were simply awful, “1 11 eat it,” said a girl, valiantly, as
one of the honorary Waitresses brought her an evil-looking
plum-tart. “ I hope you won’t be ill if you do, dear,”
said the “waitress” sympathisingly.
A rich Australian Israelite went to Abraham’S bosom
the other day and left £38,000 to his widow and offspring.
But in a clause of his will he shakes his spectral fist (unto
instant disinheritance) at any member of the family who
dares to marry a Christian, The old man can now rest
peacefully in the bosom of Lazarus. You could keep
two whole Semitic tribes from ever mashing an ungodly
Gentile by a simple little cash transaction like that.
You can always tell a sham naval officer from the
genuine article at a costume-ball (sham naval officers now
abound at Sydney costume-balls) by watching the suspect
dance. If he leaves a train of fallen human beings, spilt
chairs, and torn decorations in his wake, he is as real as
they turn ’em out of the Admiralty. But if he goes half-
way round without treading on his partner’s frock or
hanging her against some breathless fat man, it’s an abso-
lute certainty he’s only a masquerading bank-clerk.
You hear a lot about the beauty of the she-Britisher,
and you are trained to believe that Venus originally rose
from the Thames, hut when you read that in a gathering
of well-known belles Lady Carington and “Judy” Har-
hord (her sister) “ divided honours in the matter of
beauty,” it saps your young belief. Unless her rescue
from the clutches of Potts Point has improved her beyond
recognition, Lady Carington is only a dollish little woman
who set every female in the province working up her
blush like a chorus-girl—and you know’ they say example
is better than precept. Miss Harbord was simply non-
descript—Sydney society contains fifty better-looking
spinsters. If she and Lady O. are beauties, English helie-
dom has been obtaining admiration under false pretences.
On dit that the dank failure of a recent charity ball was
partly due to the fact that Lady X., who has gone away,
is still billed as patron saint because she was so keen
about the charity, while the reigning lady is only given
second position in what might lie called the dais list.
Therefore, she was a little lackadaisical about giving actual
help ; politely refused to undertake one or two things her
predecessor volunteered to do, and kept the management
undecided up to the last moment as to what date the ball
was to occur on. Just here I want to quote the moralists
who look to see our astonished incredulity when they say
that human nature is very much the same in Palace
(capital P) and the peasant’s cot (italics if you like).
A sad sight to a socially-sympathetic heart like mine is
to see the hall-committee outsider who has been coaxed
by the titled women—and what a crop of titled women
Sydney now has I—at the preliminary meetings—“ You
will sell all your tickets, I am shua'i, Mrs. Snobkins,”
says Lady So-and-So, and Mrs. S. wears her two legs right
up to the knees racing round her neighbourhood in con-
sequence. Virtue is only its own reward, though, for on
the evening Lady Blank, with ’em all on, glares blankly
over the frizzled head of Mrs. Snobkins.
By-the-by, nothing gives the painted Venus of the ball-
room more hopelessly away than a semi-fainting (it in her
partner’s arras—like the one I saw’ at the Queen’s Fund
Ball. She really staggered and almost “ went off,” as the
women say, but her poppy-red cheek-bones kept blooming
steadily all the time. I expect she had the savoir faire.
to pass it off lightly as apoplexy afterwards.
The last week of that glorified tobaooo-ad. <so far as the
guerilla members’ costumes went) “ Carmen up to Time,"
al Her Majesty’s, saw a “local” (winding up with an
agonised inquiry as to what Parkes’ baby was to be
christened ?) added to Courtneidge’s crisply enunciated,
“Only to See ” song-and another layer of pipe-clay on
Marion Hood’s anamiic-tinted tentacles. Also, smart
little Katie Barry has padded her trim little legs mill
they look fit to carry tire female giantess in the
o.p. side, and drapes her massive charms with a red
tablecloth. Katie Barry is one of these generally success-
ful actresses who sometimes allow a man to forget that
they’re women, even if got up as the spruce and alto-
gether feminine stage “boy”—Nellie Farren par
example, and eke Carrie “Tomboy ” Swain. And let us
not forget Mate Saqui’s pas suel— quite a Carinenesque
feature, in spile of her baggy frock striped like a barber’s
sign or a bull's eye. Fix Saqui up iu fan pleats and a few-
more or less dazzling skirts, and then listen to Olympia.
“ Joan of Arc” puts Carmen’s pretty nose out of joint on
Saturday.
I am told that a women wrote down from the country
to a Sydney masseur the other day asking the price of
massage per bottle, and whether it would stand a railway
journey.
A talkative wojnan the other day seated herself oppo-
site a man in the Melbourne express and opened a literary
conversation. By-and-bye she recommended to his atten-
tion two or three of her favourite works. “They would
just suit your wife,” she finished amiably, “My wife has
been dead two years,” said be.
1 am told a ridiculous story about an Honourable Some-
body who descended upon Australia, not so very long
ago, and commenced dissipating tremendously. His
rank-fearing landlady, however, did all she knew- to keep
up his dignity. If he descended to bandy hard words
with an importunate tradesman she always put a stop to
the argument by loftily interposing with, “Tut! tut I
the idea of your speaking to him —you are the Honourable
Blink Smithson, only son of Lord Wafflesnaffie!” It
always took effect.
When will the full-grown woman give up keeping small
boys out of their beds to dragoon them through the
dreadful streets ? At a concert the other evening an
imposing woman in a tufted bonnet had a wretched male
infant in a comforter and a sore throat slipping sleepily
off his chair while ma fanned herself and basked in the
music with irritating complacency. I don’t know why
she tortured that poor child so. A small boy is no pro-
tection to anybody—not even to himself. Any bold, bad
character could purchase him body and soul for a bun (
and I’m afraid he would be but a rotten reed to lean upon
in the event of the “ worst ” —which never happens—like
the man under the bed.
A new-chum aristocrat lately let loose on Australia is
“prim and most particular ” about whom he condescends
to meet. Somebody suggested introducing him to a
rather pretty and quite proper society girl the other day,
but he froze at once and said distantly : “Thanks, but
my—ah—uncle will—aw—intwodoose me to all the peepul
I ought to know’.” Dutiful youth ! I wonder how long
it will last?
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
There are now only 16 gallows in New
South Wales,
In the list of new N.S.W. magistrates is
the name of one man who has appeared before a
police-court as defendant in a very suspicious case
of theft.
The voice of the people is mighty and shall
prevail! Northumberland (N.S.W.) is repre-
sented by Messrs. Walker, Melville, and Edden.
The first Was absent during the recent divisions,
Melville, as Protectionist, voted for, and Edden,
as Labour representative, against the Govern-
ment#
The Argus reports the trial of the Aus-
tralian Banking Co. directors at considerable
length, and amidst the cablegrams from Europe.
The Age gives it casual mention in the newxs from
Sydney, and considers a five-line paragraph quite
equal to the importance of that financial scandal.
Eunny !
Jack Want, with his ’osses in training and “ yot,”
And “ got up regardless ” in raiment,
Would keep the House clear of the Labour-men lot
By asking for xvork without payment.
For full of fat fees is the barrister’s maw,
He’s a man of position and station—
But somehow he doesn’t believe in free Law
As a portion of free legislation.
Among the pall-bearers at Tennyson’s
funeral are to be the Duke of Argyll, the Marquis
of Dufferin, and the Earl of Selborne. The
Sydney Telegraph headlines the item with
“Distinguished Pall Bearers.” What does the
Telegraph mean ? That it is a distinction for a
mere Duke, a Marquis, and an Earl, to get a
prominent show at a poet’s funeral, or that the
corpse should feel flattered at having three noble-
men to take so much notice of it ?
At present the accused in the Australian
Banking Co.’s affair are, at least most of them,
better off than the jury. The former are allowed
to leave the Court and go home on bail after each
sitting, while the jury are kept in custody all the
time, and their promenade within the Court
enclosure, with locked gates and a guard of police,
is one of the sights of Darlinghurst. The show
attracts interested crowds of spectators, of whom
half mistake the jury for the prisoners, and pro-
nounce them an ill-looking gang. If the popular
voice were taken, most of the members of the
jury would certainly get about six years each.
Partisans on both sides, relative to the
Broken Hill strike, are making conspicuous asses
of themselves. A correspondent of the metro-
politan dailies manages to mix up acceptable
opinions with his nows thus : “ A petition, signed
by women, has been sent to Sydney, asking the
Government to remove the police-magistrate, Mr.
Whittingdale Johnson, whose action has done more
to preserve law and order in Broken HU! than any-
thing else;” and again, a revolver having been
taken from a blackleg : “a unionist then pointed
the weapon to the ground and fired a shot. A
big crowd collected and the usual story that a free-
labourer had tried to kill a striker was circulated.”
On the other hand, a Labour League resolution
censures Labour-member Johnston for support-
ing “ the Government that caused the arrests of
the members of the Broken Hill Defence Com-
mittee for justly trying to improve the condition of
their fellow-workers. ”
Mrs. Beeton says : “ Claret should be
sound, fruity, and soft as satin, and all the com-
ponents happily blended into a homogeneous
whole. Easy of digestion, it is a mildly stimu-
lating drink, in every way fulfilling the Scriptural
character as a ‘ wirie that inaketh glad the heart
of man.’” Innes’s Boar’s Head Clarets, at all
grocers, at Is., Is. Gd., 25., and 3s. a bottle, can
be recommended as purer and better wines than
French clarets, and they are only one-third of the
price H

Alexandra The Greenwoods,
“Genevieve de Brabant,” with which
Madame Emily Soldene opened last Monday at
Sydney Garrick, is not an inspiriting opera Tt
was obviously written by a man who joked" with
great difficulty, and some other man who joked
witli even greater difficulty has been lately a t
work localising it. The results of his sinful inter
ference are that a local gag turns up almost every
two minutes, and out of, at least, forty suc i,
wheezes on Monday night, the audience laughed
at only two, and took the other thirty-eight in
dead and awful silence. There is nothing even
faintly approaching humour in any of these
allusions ; the brightest of them is that in which
the Duke damns Andy Kelly, and the next
brightest is where he gets a drink after ll p u j
because he is a friend of Thomas Walker, M P
The same good and sympathetic soul who per-
petrated these things has added three verses of
his own to the duet of the gensdarmes, and where
his capacity for rhyme gives out he fills up with
blank verse. These insults arc all very rough upon
“Genevieve,” which is only a skeleton opera at the
best, and presently gets buried among the debris,
The only interpolation which is an undeniable
•success is Miss Bella Bash all's “serpentine
dance ” beneath the limelight. This is a graceful
little item, and when the light is turned on behind
the lady and sire proves to be transparent the
gallery is obviously gratified.
* * #
Time has not perpetrated any serious
ravages on Madame Soldene. She is a trifle
heavier in her manner than she used to be, and
her voice is a little hard and worn, but this is only
perceptible when she climbs recklessly on to a
high note, and at other times her vocal organ is as
sweet as of yore. She fills the part of Drogan,
the baker, which is a lamentably poor part
for a lady of her abilities; and on Monday
she received a cordial reception, a small
Chinaman’s garden - full of flowers which
were handed over the footlights in steady
succession till the orchestra nearly fainted with
humping the vegetables, and several encores—
though her best song, “’Tis true her hair was
raven black,” somehow missed fire. Miss
Josephine Deakin, however, as Duchess Gene-
vieve, is the one unalloyed success of the show,
and the only really unanimous yell of applause on
the opening night was the one which was fired at
her bright eyes and her golden head. The rest of
the company consist of Mr. George Leopold, who
gives a fat, flushed, and helpless rendering of the
Duke; Mr. Shine, in the capacity of the burgo-
master; Mr, Walton, as Piton ; and a miscel-
laneous collection of well-meaning people who call
for no special mention. The staging is also first
rate, and the chorus fairly effective.
** * *
“ Carmen up to Data” still lives on the
strength of the magnificent scenery, and the glare
of light, and the music, and the legs, and the
other things that have no connection with the
literary element of the show. As for the said
literary element it was not there when the bur-
lesque first started, and the place where it has
never been seen since can be pointed out pretty
nearly all over the earth, In The Bulletin's
opinion the Gaiety Co.’s visitations have done a
lot of damage to the “silken bonds ” industry. It
had a great reputation while it stayed away, and
the longer it stayed away the more reputation it
had, and if it had stayed away altogether it is
difficult to foresee what might not have eventu-
ated. And in this respect it much resembled
Brigand Stanley, Murray, Edinburgh, Barren
Caringtbn, and many other British institutions,
which for want of a quantity of judicious absence
fell heavily in public estimation. Pretty nearly
the only British institution which knows enough
to stay away regularly is Victoria herself, whose
consistency in not visiting Australia is eminently
praiseworthy. Moreover, burlesque, at the best,
is the next thing to an opium-sodden dream, and
when the opium isn't good the dream degenerates.
People who have tried the two sometimes prefer
the opium. On Saturday, “ Joan of Arc” comes
upon the scene, when one of the finest and most
pathetic characters in history will canter round in
a ridiculous fashion behind the footlights, and be
made to look something like Mary of Scotland
being beheaded in tights, or Portia doing the barn-
dance in Venice.

Max O’Bell finished his season on Saturday
night with his lecture upon “ Her Royal Highness,
Woman,” and proved to his own satisfaction, and
that of the audience, and to the satisfaction of R.
S. Smythe, who was beaming at the front door,
that woman is the greatest invention of the age,
and that the dainty angel who darns the socks of
that failure, man, is the fairest and gentlest bless-
ing which ever descended upon a sin-cursed
earth. It was a convincing lecture, and we went
away pondering on the ideal woman, and wonder-
ing where she could be found, and then a little
way round the corner we heard an elderly matron
swearing profusely up a right-of-way. It was too
dark to ascertain whether she had any connection
with the subject or not. Probably she hadn’t.
Max is now prevading the inland towns, and pro-
poses to fill in the Cup week at Melbourne.
** * *
Tne difference between the casting of
“A Village Priest” at Melbourne Bijou and at
Sydney Garrick explains how a mild “ frost ” has
been succeeded by a warm success. Jenny Watt-
Tanner, who appeared as the blind saint in
Sydney, is now much more effectively placed as a
reformed countess, the part for which Olga
Nethersole was obviously too girly. Slim, self-
contained Miss Romer satisfies the general idea
of a Christian mother deprived of her eyesight.
Titheradge, too, is a pastoral poem of a priest as
compared with Cartwright’s harsh, discordant
interpretation of the character, whilst that other
shouter, what’s-his-name (the stagey, Kurly Blew
sort of young ma»): hadn’t any of Brough’s best
qualifications for playing the closp-eropped con-
vict Acted as it is now, “A Village Priest ’
would have made a big stir in Sydney, without
doubt.

Melbourne Bijou was packed on Monday
• i ]( . when Mayne put in his benefit appearance
nlr ßichelieu. Moreover, the multitude cheered
fL occasional tragedian with genuine warmth,
• ncl gently expressed approval of his effort. All
tUrws considered, Mayne was neither a dissap-
-1 ointment nor a howling success. He underacted
R uharacter in a very capable manner, and played
for safety throughout. He might, with advantage,
I a ve produced an older, feebler, and more
I* terical Cardinal; on the other hand, he might
Hvc ranted as Richelieus are apt to do, but he
lU no t. The chief fault in a level, gentlemanly
performance was attached to its leading virtue—
the Cardinal spoke his lines like a superior elocu-
tionist!, hut on a marked elocutionary system.
Truly great men never trade on a system —Parkes
•ind ’pom Bent, notables in point. The support
given to the star of the evening was not as strong
fj s it looked on the hill. Cecil Ward, Boucicault
and Mrs. Brough did very well, but Titheradge
made nothing of Baradas, and Harwood, with a
steel coal-scuttle on his honoured head, was a
sight for the gods.

Six nights of “The Pointsman” were
started at Melbourne Princess’ on Saturday. The
hand of Time hasn’t dealt reverently with this
popular drama, and now that the bloom of its
lusty novelty is faded and gone, “The Points-
mn” delights us not. It is a weak and wild
aggregation of incidents in four acts and a pro-
ir g ie, and ts actor-parentage can he detected all
Um time. A good, old-fashioned murder calls for
favourable mention, also a stirring railway colli-
sm ii makes some amends for the intrinsic stupidity
of the story, hut, regarded as food for the intellect,
“The Pointsman” is a vain thing. Moreover,
the present performance doesn’t hide the play’s
worst defects. Sass is physically incapable of
realising a villain who has graduated at a small
livjrside pub., and, although delightfully wicked
! s usual, he quite fails to prove his identity
with Dick Dugdale. Neither can Miss Henrietta
Watson quite suit herself to her railway
station in life, and the foolish requirements of a
homely part. For a cottage-bred wife of a points-
man she seems to act a cut above her surround-
ings, and not to be sufficiently restricted by a
small allowance for housekeeping. Albert Lucas,
who was apparently borrowed from the Rickards
company to fill the heroic role of Tom Bedstone,
doesn’t carry enough guns for the work. He talks
like a young man with a fine belief in himself, and
bears himself accordingly, but the influence of
Lucas on the show is generally unsatisfactory.
He may do much better in the future if he can
grasp the fact that art is long and soul
imperatively necessary. Miss Maud William-
son, as of yore, monopolises all the really human
interest and scores a double-first in honours.
Her dissatisfaction with the poverty-stricken
respectability of a married life in which the male
partner is mostly drunk, and little less objection-
able when sober, is expressed with even more than
the original force and feeling. There are one or
two opportunities for her to speak the truth
amidst the hollow fallacies of this entertainment,
and Miss Williamson rises to the top of the
occasions. Lawrence is cornmendably unpleasant
as the drunken captor of the wild bird aforesaid.
G. P. Carey puts life into Matt. Collins, whilst
Cosgrove, the murdered pal of the hero, is so
bright and manly during his few minutes of life
that they would do well to slaughter the other
fellow instead. Why kill the wrong actor in the
prologue ?
** * *
On Saturday next Pollard’s Juvenile Opera
Company open at the Princess’s in “The Gon-
doliers.” The children have not yet been heard
in Melbourne, so they will probably create a
demand for something that is out of the common
way.
** * *
The Greenwood Family, in conjunction
with a few unfortunates, gave a performance of
“Blanche” at Melb. Alexandra on Saturday.
“ Blanche ” was altogether too shocking for dis-
cussion in a sixpenny paper, but it served to
further expose the eccentricities of the daily press.
The Age reports that Maribel Greenwood’s songs
“were prettily sung, and were like showers of
rain in a desert of dreary flatulence,” but the
Argus mentions that “the indisposition of the
leading lady necessitated the excision of her
songs.” The Bulletin also believes that the
melodies didn’t occur, but felt too ill at the time
to say for certain.
** * *
At Melbourne Bijou they have resumed
operations with “A Village Priest,” after the
“Richelieu” interlude, and the good shepherd is
still going strong and well. The miracle turns up
regularly at the appointed moment, and perhaps
on Friday night Titheradge may plead for the
revelation to be enlarged sufficiently to include
some inspired information touching the Caulfield
Cup. A priest can’t be too practical these times,
and, if Tith. can get a Divine tip with money in
it, so much the better.

Melbourne Opera House (where Rickards
had a rousing benefit last Saturday) is to re-open
on the 15th with Emerson and Woods’ Minstrels,
fresh from their Sydney boom. The Gaiety
nourishes exceedingly just now, ditto the Cogills
at St. George’s Hall. The approaching departure
for Adelaide of the Battle of Waterloo has revived
a strong holiday interest in that splendid land-
scape with soldiers on it, and the Siege of Paris is
m considerable demand. As for the Waxworks,
words fail to describe its many extra beauties and
special attractions for the billion.
At Poverty Point.
The home News styles Puttie Browne “ the Australian
contralto.” Next thing we’ll hear of Gratiano Riggsi,
the Australian tenor.
The Musin combination made money in Sydney and
Maoriland, lost money 7 in Melbourne and Brisbane.
Mrs. Bernard-Beere says that “ the people of Sydney
behaved as though ‘As in a Looking-Glass’ was above
them.” Above them ? Pooh! this story of a
rufflsh card-sharper and his dollymop and decoy could
not be above the aspirations and sympathies of any audi-
ence except one of habitual criminals. “ Looking-Glass ”
is neither good comedy, nor thrilling melodrama, and
that the people of Sydney didn’t like it is distinctly to
their credit.
The Lady Godiva procession has been revived in
Coventry (Eng.) after a lapse of five years. It consists in
a cheap variety actress riding through the town in flesh-
coloured tights so as to create a general impression that
she hasn’t anything on, and, taking it all round,
it is about the most gratuitously vulgar exhibition
of the century. A big procession accompanies the
beastly show, and the town turns out 40,000 strong, and
hoorays vociferously.
Spagnoletti: “ On Saturday last, my visit to Gordon’s
grave, Brighton Cemetery, was partly repaid by a study
of the gravediggers, quite the counterparts of Shake-
speare’s, in ‘ Hamlet,’ old and young, only the first
gravedigger has a wooden leg, which he wrenches out of
the clay with a ker-plunk, like the kiss of a Barcoo man.
Watching a funeral, I saw exactly how the immortal
William studied the graveyard scene.”
W. G. Carey, actor, applied to Melbourne Supreme
Court, the other day, for exemption as a juryman, on the
score of rehearsals, but was refused. At one time an
actor would no more have got on a jury than a butcher.
The amateur performance of “Cloches de Corneville ”
at Melbourne Opera House last Thursday seems to have
taken the newspaper critics by surprise. A mention of
these capable amateurs, and the clever work of their
youthful scenic artist, was made in Tub Bulletin a few
weeks ago.
A London paper announces that Ethel Blenheim, “who
achieved such a success as Nellie Barren’s deputy in Aus-
tralia,” will appear at some music-hall shortly. This is
the sort of paragraph which keeps alive the fiction that
anything is good enough for Australia. Ethel Blenheim
didn’t achieve “ such a success ” as alleged. We politely
endured Ethel; that’s all.
Slade Murray has been booked for the new “firm’s”
Sydney panto., “ Little Red Riding Hood.”
Jenny Hill’s trip to Australia, for the benefit of her
health, may result in a star engagement. Perhaps the
Vital Spark will fall amongst “The Forty Thieves” at
Melbourne Princess’s.
Prahran, Melb., Council authorises Sunday concerts in
its Town Hall, and the clergy are like an ants’ nest with
boiling water poured on. The Day of Judgment has just
about arrived, through this sinful rasping and rootle-
tootling. *
Partner George Musgrove will possibly remain at the
other end of the cable, putting more polish on his Picca-
dilly style, until J. Cassius W, reckons that the times are
ripe lor another big shipment of comic opera or burlesque
novelties. Then Muzzy will come out in charge of the
goods.
Stuart Cumberland is still thought-reading round and
about Great Britain. Does anyone remember how Cum-
berland insulted the great Fitzgibbon at Melbourne Town
Hall, by asking him to pretend he was murdering some-
body? Fitz. considered that the suggestion was not
decent, and snorted horribly.
The prevalence of the new craze, the “ Serpentine ”
dance, has produced the mot , applicable to any fair per-
former, that “ she is snaked and not ashamed.”
Charles Harding, the robustious tenor, was originally a
sailor, and later kept a woodyard in Auckland, M.L.
Snazelle used to be a clerk. Stockwell was an iron-
monger, and—the greatest last, Harry P. and Chas. W.
Coghill once sold pork pies.
Mrs. Green, the well-known Melbourne dancing-mistress,
learned her art under John d’Auban and one of the
Conquests. As showing heredity, Maie Saqui is a grand-
niece of hers, and Florrie Green, best of all Australian
child-dancers, is her daughter.
Emerson and Wood’s Minstrels open to-night (Saturday)
at Melbourne Opera House. Emerson is in vivid remem-
brance with his two former visits, and has always since
been the Jeffersonic standard of excellence. Marcus
Clarke rawed him, by writing that he imitated Harry
Kelly—his pupil.
Only seven London theatres open when the last mail
left 1 Must be Vat-ley. Why, London, with its throngs o*
visitors, is not theatred to a twentieth part of the Mel-
bourne average.
The Chicago Exhibition rouses a difference between the
Congress and Commissioners, through Congress voting a
million sterling on condition that there are no nude
statues or pictures and the Exposition is not open on
Sunday ; but the Commissioners are expected to let the
vote go and revel in all these concomitants.
Wilmot Eyre, well-known in Australia, died in South
Africa of fever, lately, and Mark Kinghorne had a narrow
escape.
Harry Rickards’ benefit, Melbourne Opera House, with
all the Music Hall talent, gave a line for the Alhambra
notion. Managers have been talking over the pros and
cons.
“ Melbournean ” points out, in answer to a correspon-
dent who wants Alhambras, Empires, and Tivolis in the
“Paris of the South,” that the Licensing Act prohibits
alcoholic music-halls. Yet the theatres are a flagrant
evasion, with their bars, for every musical performance
they give is an undeniable breach of the law. The coach
is driven with eight horses abreast, but even the elo-
quence of a Coppin couldn’t work the sending round of
an alcoholic tray inside.
A London paper thus enthuses over the death of Sarahi
in “ Camille ” : “ She lifts her arms, her face is upturnedi
she stands reaching upwards to Heaven ; she is trans-
figured ; quite a divine light of love illuminates her
beautiful eyes, her smile; then she droops her head,
quietly—ineffable joy ! —upon her lover’s breast. It is all
over ; and when he lets her go she falls, as lightly as a
dead leaf—she flutters, wavers, impalpably to the
ground.”
The following verse is suggested as an encore verse to
Courtneidge’s “ We give ’em away ” ditty;—
Some high-toned Sydney ladies have been going rather
strong,

The Wild Cat Columu.
We have before us a particularly candid and
outspoken circular issued to its depositors by the Anglo-
Australian Investment, Finance, and Land Co. (Ld.), one
of the two Sydney “banks” which staved off then-
creditors under the Companies Arrangement Act—the
other one was the Commercial Trading, Agency and Bank-
ing Co., which still announces in the papers at intervals
that the dividend of 10 per cent, is now 7 payable. The
circular in question sets forth five gratifying statements
in close marching order, and leaves the flabbergasted
depositor to consider them at his leisure (1) The Com-
pany paid the last instalment of interest —not the prin-
cipal, but only the interest—by the skin of its teeth
or thereabouts ; (2) it doesn’t feel at all hopeful
about the next instalment ; (3) if the company goes
into liquidation the securities won’t fetch enough to
pay even the debenture-holders, while the depositors
won’t get the shadow of a solitary cent; (4) that the
company therefore offers, in exchange for each deposit-
receipt, shares paid up to 10s. in the Australia Hotel
Company, said shares to be taken, apparently, at their
nominal value of 10s., quite regardless of the fact that
they may not be w 7 orth, in the present depressed condition
of affairs, even 2s. 6d. on the open market, and to take his
chance (or rather certainty) of calls ; (5) that the company,
being apparently sitting on the dizzy brink of something
or other, and time being precious, requests an ansvver
by return of post. This is the banking business with
the gilt off it at last—the plain, unvarnished mud-bank
of finance after the tide has gone out. The prospect
for the depositors seems to be—if they don’t accept the
offer and the bank liquidates they get nothing; if they do
accept they receive certain shares at much above their
value, and take the risk of having to pay calls thereon, as
an addition to their other losses. Truly he is a happy
man nowadays who gets a chance to take out his deposit
in cigars and oleographs and garden truck, or any similar
visible security, or who can bet his deposit receipt on the
Melbourne Cup, or otherwise get rid of the incubus and
stand from under.
* * *
Consider the Anglo-Australian Investment,
Finance and Land Co., how it has been allowed to fall
softly from its high estate. It suspended payment in the
heyday of the boom—for a few hours only, it is true, but
the circumstance was as significant as if it had suspended
for a few years—and had to stave off its creditors till a
certain bank-manager was brought over in red-hot haste
from Melbourne per special train to arrange some fresh
advances to the tottering institution; and the daily
papers obligingly said nothing about the incident. It
suspended again later on, and the law 7 allowed it to shunt
off its obligations for three years under the infamous
Companies Arrangement Act. Then the Supreme Court
decided that it was perfectly justified under its articles of
association in sinking the deposits in a swell hotel, which
decision surprised an enormous number of people, and is
surprising them still. There was an audit, and the com-
pany was let down softly once more by a report to the
effect that the business had been absolutely honest, only
a few unfortunate mistakes had been made such as per-
petually writing up the unsold properties, and calling the
amounts thus tacked on “profits,” and then paying
these unrealised profits away in dividends out of the
deposits, &c. But the directors pointed out that things were
still healthy, and the company had a great future before
it, and though it had a lot of unlet houses and unsold pro-
perties on hand, yet, as Sydney was bound to expand,
these were just the sort of properties that people who
wanted properties of that kind W'ould presently rush
after—in fact, there w 7 as going to be a perfect furore after
the company’s houses and allotments. That wasn’t quite
three months ago, and now the same Anglo-Australian
blandly intimates that if it is liquidated to-morrow 7 there
won’t be enough even to pay the debenture-holders,
while the depositors, shareholders, and miscellaneous
creditors will get—nothing! ! And, therefore, it now
seems just about time for radical investigation to begin,

One of the questions of the day is : Why did
Agent-General Munro want the public to believe that
Mrs. John Woods, who has been making a lot of damaging
statements about him, was married to “Honest” John
before the first Mrs. Woods’ tombstone had time to settle
down? Even if he could prove that John married his
second wife before the first one was dead, the Real Estate
Bank won’t be any the less burst. This tendency on
Munro’s part to go off on side-issues about the marriages
of his defunct pals is a melancholy waste of time while so
many mysteries are awaiting explanation,

Justice Backhouse told the accused in the Aus-
tralian Banking case that if any of them objected, the
jurors would not be paid an extra fee. Just fancy any
of the crowd being foolish enough to object! Moreover,
why should they care a rap what screw the Government
gave the jurymen ?

But how much money did that Melbourne man’s

A Broken Hill magnate, the other day, said
that the contract system was “ good for good men.” He
knew men who had made £8 a week at it. Just imagine
the Knoxocracy continuing to stand by calmly while
common working miners were making £8 per week !
« • #
Broken Hill metallurgist Schlapp did not return
per last ’Frisco mail. He is reported to have “ missed
the boat.” This, of course, is quite unlikely. People of
the Schlapp order don’t miss boats. There is a whisper
that Schlapp and Schnaebel regard the sulphide question
as solved ; they are now quietly travelling in the States
watching several processes in operation. The fall in silver
has, however, somewhat interfered with the calculations
of the Broken Hill ring who brought about the strike to
reduce wages below £3 a week in a place which, consider-
ing the circumstances under which the miner has to live,
is a perfect hell-upon-earth.

It is stated that, at Broken Hill, some free
labourers have been put to “ light work ” at 4s, 2d. a day,

Judging from what we hear down South, an
attempt will shortly be made to reduce miners’ wages at
Charters Towers. In Victoria, the employers contend,
the miners only get 42s. for 48 hours’ work, and even
at that rate a man has to be a specially excellent hand to
keep his place. At Qympie, the men get 50s. only for
48 hours, and at Charters Towers, 60s. is paid for 44£
hours. But then, look at the difference in the climate
between Ballarat or Bendigo and Charters Towers.

Oorney Proud, the pious S.A. Register re-
porter who turned broker and grew wealthy, is said to
have had a nasty knock over Broken Hills. Which is
cruel, for he is an outspoken democrat, and has taken the
part of the men right through the present dispute.

The Mercantile Bank meeting (Melb.) was
packed, in a sense. That is to say, all Matthew’s friends
had taken care to obtain tickets of admission, whilst a
number of un-“ representative ” sufferers didn’t know of
the ticket arrangement, and so were compelled to stop
outside.

“Coam to the pooint, Sir Davies, and don’t
crawl like a snail over a cabbage,” was the exhortation
shouted to the ex-chairman at last week’s “ Mercantile”
meeting. But the knight never did come to any very
sharp points. His “explanations” were mostly as
evasive as those of the other Davies on the Freehold
Investment subject a few days before.
* * *
Old friend David Gaunson turned up at the
Mercantile Bank meeting, last week, and moved “ that a
prosecution, even if instituted at public expense, inas-
much as it would depreciate the assets realisable, is to be
deprecated.” The patriotic sawdust was knocked out of
Gaunson months ago, and now he opposes any endeavour
to cleanse the public credit of Victoria, on the ground
that it might affect the value of a bank’s assets. Gaunson
is very unsatisfactory. In the first place, he can’t, for
the life of him, give logical reasons for his assertion.
Secondly, he is spoiling the effect of Tom Bent’s little
game—“ whatever we do, let us (Bent holds ten shares in
the Mercantile) keep out of the lawyers’hands.”
is-a lawyer, and his arc obviously the sort df hand? that
Bent would like to see taking sole charge of the Davies
scandal. The Speaker’s famous exhortation needs to be
amended—“ Let us keep out of unpleasant lawyers’
hands.’’
• * *
“Until the end of last year I was a wealthy
man,” said Matthew Davies, from the platform. His
voice trembled with emotion. Then liquidator Ducker
arose and mentioned that up to the end of last year the
Davies companies had drawn from half to three-quarters-
of-a-million sterling from the Mercantile Bank. And his
voice trembled with emotion.
* # #
The friends of Matthew Davies evidently
imagined they had a soft thing in the appointment of
Ducker as second liquidator for the Mercantile. Graham
Berry, before taking himself off, congratulated the meet-
ing on their new liquidator, and hoped that “ the mis-
fortune might not be so great after all.” An idea that
Ducker would “put a pleasant face on matters,” and
preach the gospel of peace, innocence, and good-will,
seemed to prevail. When he replied to the Davies speech,
and spoke of transactions not being “honest,” and
contrary to the articles of association, &c., &0., it was
amusing to notice how a deathly pallor crept over the
faces of the representative bluffers. The new man was
not turning out such a tame duck as they had hoped for.
# * #
The Daviesian estimate of Melbourne intelli-
gence must be low indeed when Sir Matthew can
seriously advance, as evidence of his “ belief in the Mer-
cantile Bank,” the fact that he ordered somebody to buy
him 500 shares a fortnight before the show shut up. But
the awful correctness of the Daviesian estimate was
proved by the shareholders and depositors seriously lis-
tening to this simple little yarn. On the face of things,
Matthew was merely making one last desperate effort to
“ restore confidence” when he gave a seemingly gullible
and soft-headed shareholder—one W. R. Bell —the job of
buying for him another 500 shares. Has Matthew Davies
the effrontery to pretend that, in his then embarrassed
state, and with a full knowledge that the Bank’s available
funds were almost exhausted, he selected those shares as
a first-class investment for his money ? In short, does the
knight claim to be written down an ass because he acted
exactly as any other desperate speculator would have
acted under the same circumstances?
* # #
When Matthew Davies had made his “ explana-
tion ” the Age decided to follow the lead of the Argus
by suggesting that legal proceedings are advisable. “We
can conceive of nothing that would more permanently
damn our credit abroad than that it should go forth to
the world that we have hushed up a series of enormous
banking scandals,” piped the Daily Syme. But it had
taken “ we ” a terribly long time to discover any necessity
for echoing this truism.
# « *
Subsequent to the financial collapse of Sir
Matthew Davies, his wife (and her relatives) stated that
she would be “ able to live in the same style as before,
whatever happened.” The present means of Lady Davies,
on the solemn statement of her husband, are limited to
£l6OO capital, or less than £lOO a year. Consequently,
Lady Davies must have been dreaming when she talked of
living, on in the same old way, and it is a pity that she
(and her lady friends) put forward such a strange division
as a simple fact.
* * #
Simpson, the gifted unraveller of the Daviesian
tangle, is highly respected by all the Bar luminaries of
Melbourne. On the wall of his office hangs an address,
drawn up by Justice A'Beekett (on his Honor’s promo-
tion), and presented to the legal-accountant by Purves.
* « *
Of that “ plentiful crop of writs ” which arose
from Simpson’s first report on the Mercantile Bank
swindle not one has been issued. The writters, poor
critters ! must have decided that Simpson is too hot to
touch. Nevertheless, there is such an influential feeling
in favour of silencing this “dangerous” person that many
people expect him to be touched with something hard,
one of these dark nights. An awful idea, which is quite
freely suggested in the city of financial stink.
# * *
The “ bluff ” of the Davies faction can be judged
by this choice sample. A morning newspaper representa-
tive, waiting to interview the Mercantile Bank hero, on
his arrival at the Melbourne railway platform, was actually
told by the expected person’s brother that “it wasn’t
decent to address Sir Matthew (powerful accent on the
‘ Sir ’) on business mattahs in this mannah.” Thereupon
the “ most uncalled-for” journalist made a reply which
shut up Matthew Davies’s brother in one act. But the
wonder was that Speaker Bent hadn’t already shoved the
vulgar intruder over and sat on him. Bent doesn’t believe
in them noospaper fellers a bit, ’e don’t, and his opinions
on the h’indecency of h’any sort of public inkwiry under
the circumstances are exceedingly strong,

One of the best-managed mines in Queensland
is the Biggenden gold and bismuth property. It has de-
clared half-a-dozen dividends, and, during the last half-
year, produced over £3OOO in gold and some £lO,OOO in
bismuth. The work of development never ceases, and by
efficient workmanship and plant an otherwise difficult ore
is effectively concentrated.

The pi ucky Broken (Brisbane) Blocks proprietary,
after five years of persistent diamond-drilling—failure
rewarded the first two years’ work, hut fresh capital was
subscribed to test fresh ground—has, at a depth of 1960
feet, discovered a stratum 50 feet thick of argentiferous
sandstone and schists, assaying 30 ozs. silver per ton.
Although this is nbt payable at the expensive depth
named, the discovery is important when the locality of
the bore is considered, and it is remembered that the
depth is three times that of any attained in the main
Broken Hill lode. Indeed, the Barrier Miner doubts if
this find “ is not of actually greater importance than the
discovery of the biggest slug ever found on the Eastern
slope.” It effectually disproves the oft-repeated asser-
tion that at 500 or 600 feet even the sulphide rocks are
valueless and almost innocent of silver.

Many persons, including ourselves, have con-
founded the Swamp Oak field with that of Niangala,
which is some 10 miles away and in a distinct belt of
country. Working miners whose opinions we value above
those of all directors, legal managers, and alleged experts,
and many mining managers have written us in praise of
the former and all urge the “ Wild Cat man, whoever he
is ”to pay it a visit and use his own judgment. Well, he
will go and be pleased to see some good permanent gold-
bearing quartz reefs, and to admit he has seen them if
they exist.

As we anticipated, the Mount Galena mine, of
which great things were predicted, is in a call-paying
condition. The block of payable ore is evidently worked
out and the work of looking for another is slowly pro-
ceeding. What has become of the Mount Galena-Deep-
water tramway, the right for which was given by N.S.W.
Parliament many months ago, and why was there no
penalty for non-fulfilment? No boom—no tramway ?

The Maoriland Minis-

and storekeeper in a
small way in the early
days of the West Coast
goldfields; “ J ook ”
M'Kenzie, Minister for
Lands and Agriculture,
was a shepherd, and is
now a large farmer;
Cadman, Minister for
J ustice and Native
Affairs, was a carpenter,
and is now of indepen-
dent means and one of
the most courteous of
men, which can also be
said of Ward, Postmaster-
General, formerly tele-
graph-messenger, now a
well -to- do merchant.
Carroll, the Native mem-
ber of the Executive, is
of the most aristocratic
lineage, his mother having
been a Maori chieftainess
of rank, and Reeves

Minister for Education
and Labour, is the most

He is an English Univer-

When Henry Lawson was in Brisbane it
was the common lament of the three Queensland
poets that they had but one good ear amongst

perhaps the price they pay for being privileged to
catch an echo of the divine harmony.
When Lord Rosebery was in Sydney he
put on no amount of “side,” but sought information
from anyone he happened to converse with. G. R.
Gibbs was chatting with him once when Rosebery
expressed surprise at the evident contempt in
which the N.S. Wales people held their C.M.G.’s,
and asked Dibbs if he could suggest a reason.
Gibbs promptly solved the difficulty. “ We don’t
respect C.M.G.’s,” he said, “ for the same reason
that a butcher doesn’t care for sausages. We
know what they are made of. ”
Dibbs says he was never so surprised in
his life as when he met Queen Victoria. He had
pictured her to himself as a substantial personage,
and was astounded to find her a little and frail’
almost shrivelled old lady. “ Why, I could have
taken her up with one hand and put her into my
overcoat pocket.” What a pity he didn’t! Just
think of it—Queen Victoria in one pocket, and in
the other a box of the Prince of Wales’ cigars *
1 his experience of G. Republican Dibbs bears out
an old Bulletin theory—it is the Newspaper
Queen, the Queen of the illustrated papers, who
sits on the British throne.
Dear Bulletin, —Do certain years specially
produce genius? George Eliot, Lowell, Walt.
Whitman, all born in 1819; Tennyson, Holmes,
Poe, Elizabeth Barrett, Browning, all in 1809;
Whittier, and Longfellow, in 1807. 1892 has, so
far, been fatal to three of the list, Whitman,
Whittier, and Tennyson; and all have gone but
Holmes. Will he survive the year?— Kanuck.
The only genuine wit on the Australian
Bench, so far as The Bulletin knows, is District
Court Judge Paul, of Queensland —a man with
many of the gentle and loveable characteristics of
Charles Lamb. At Barcaldine Circuit Court,
Paul requests the Chinese interpreter to ask the
witness, his countryman, to recount what he saw
on the night of the sth ultimo. Celestial witness,
after the question is put, proceeds to pour forth a
rapid torrent of the purest Cantonese. “Not so
fast,” says Paul gravely, “I’m not a short hand
writer. ”
Rev. Caleb Booth, Anglican, who died in
Melbourne the other day. w'as an amiable man,
who made only one mistake in his life, a thing
which, very likely accidental, or at least exag-
gerated, thrilled all Victoria for one day. A
Melbourne paper had a leading article, many
years ago, describing how a little dog disturbed
Booth while conducting service at Northcote, and
also how Booth took up the dog and broke its leg,
the crunch being heard all over the congregation.
Nevertheless, the dead man’s general character

who was essentially a thieves’ lawyer, and knew
from “informationreceived” what he was talking
about, charged Small with all manner of crueltie°s
—“spread-eagling,” “the gag,” and so on. A
committee of inquiry was appointed, and the
various tortures tested by the committee, the
result being that the “gag,” &c., are put by with
the leg-irons worn in olden days by Sudds and

Parkes, in his amazingly bumptious inter-
view with Sydney D.T., re the death of Tennyson;
“ I am very slow to acknowledge anybody as a

friend. Talk about patronage! But then a
living ass is always better than a dead lion.
“Passing nie in the crowd, at Hallam Tennyson’s
marriage in June, 1884, Tennyson spoke tome:
Good-bye,’ he said, ‘we are both old fellows; we
shall never meet again.’ ” By Heavens ! that may
be true—in their poetical capacities, at least, they
will, certainly be allotted separate places in the
next world. The anecdote reminds the writer of
a Sydney execution he once attended. Two men
were about to be hanged, and stood on the gallows
together. One approached the other and held out
his hand as well as heeould, saying, “ Good-bye!”
Gruesome thought ! They were going different
ways.
Eugene O’Conor, better known as “the
Buller Lion,” is a descendant of Irish kings who
adorns Maoriland Parliament. Eugene is a
“ pretty figure of a man,” but his two eyes aren’t
set to the same focus. He was tackled at a meet-
ing by a voluble countrywoman : “You won’t dar
look me straight in the face and say that agin,”
said she. “My good woman,” was the reply
delivered in the blandest tone, “ I’d give <£so this

Dick heard of his flight, filled a knapsack with
provisions, and started across country after him
walking right on for 80 miles over the ranges until
he overtook his man. The contractor was bumn
tious and wouldn’t pay, and the future Minister'
doffed knapsack and coat, and “took .£5O-worth ”
out of the defaulter’s hide, calmly setting off tn
tramp back home after the trouble at peace wiiu
the world. Dick’s fighting instincts are some
times too much for him now. Standing up in his
place the other day as Acting-Premier, he was
protesting against a prolonged stonewall, when a
member of the Opposition made an offensive per
sonal remark sotto voce. The light of battle came
into the Minister’s eye at once, and he rapped out •
“If that remark wore made to me outside f
would put that lion, member into a condition in
which he would never make another.” Th e words
were “ taken down,” the bellicose Minister had to
leave the chamber, and there was a terrible to-do
before he was whitewashed and allowed to return
to his place as leader of the House.
Sir Thos. Cockburn Campbell, who com-
mitted suicide, the other day, in Western Aus-
tralia, had been for years a victim of the chloral
habit. As was stated at the inquest, he often
while under the influence of narcotics, talked and
wrote a good deal of nonsense. A correspondent
tells us that when deceased was examined in
London, before the Royal Commission, re the
Enabling Bill, he astonished the members con-
siderably. He assured General Hamley that no
Imperial reservation at King George’s Sound for
defence purposes was necessary. Western Aus-
tralia, without any Imperial aid whatever, but
with the assistance of the other colonies, would
he said, find no difficulty in “getting over” either
France or Germany should one of those nations
venture to attack her. Meanwhile, Mr. S. H
Parker, the other delegate, and Sir Win. Robin-
son, then the prospective Governor, were pacing
the corridor outside much exercised in mind as to
Campbell’s wild utterances and the damage they
might cause. One night at a swell smoke-concert
at which the Prince of Wales was present Sir
Thos. Campbell, who greatly affected high
society during his visit, sat next to Sinclair, the
%vell-known and exceedingly youthful - looking
Archdeacon of London. Turning to Sinclair, Sir
Thos. cried, “This damned fool on my other side
wants to stuff me that you are the Archdeacon of
London, ’ and he smote his neighbour on the knee.
“So I am,” said the priest, stretching out a
churchly-clad and shapely lower limb in evidence.
Sir Thos. was embarrassed, but his new acquaint-
ance came to the rescue, and. according to the
former’s own story, the trouble was promptly
wiped out in whisky and soda.
Dr. Morgan T. Wills, a recognised Ameri-
can authority on cerebral disease and insanity,
writes: “It is well for us to know that the
emotions cause more unhappiness and crime than
any other function of the brain. Human beings
are governed by their emotions, and it is well
that they should be, though it is emotions that
wear away the brain. It is the emotions such as
anxiety, fear, sorrow, and love. I consider that
eight hours are sufficient for a man to use his
brain, because if he exceeds that time he becomes
nervous and fretful, and an exhausted brain is an
irritable brain. You may not feel the evil effects
of the stress of brain work at the time, but you
will sooner or later, when it will be too late.
I he men that work at night with their brains are
the ones that expose themselves to danger and
death, which will surely come unless the great
strain on the mind is lightened. Any man that
neglects the_ first warning of a brain or nervous
system that is becoming exhausted, overtaxed, or
about to break down, is not only a fool but a
criminal. These signs are not many, but they tell
the story of coming dangers only too plainly.
Headache, sleeplessness, irritability of temper,
neuralgic pains about the head and heart, un-
refreshed sleep, nervous dyspepsia, dull eyes,
heaviness of the head and stupid 'feelings after
meals, worry about trifles, unreasonable anger,
tingling and numbness in the limbs, cold feet and
hands, flushed face and burning ears, palpitation
of the heart, and irregular, weak and unsteady
pulse. When you note these symptoms, beware;
the brain and nerves are about to break down, and
it-may be insanity, perhaps death.” For all such
troubles we recommend Clements Tonic. This is
a scientific specific, brain and nerve food, and
positively repairs the ravages of overwork, time,
disease, &c. Mrs. Ann Wickham, Heyfield,
Gippsland, writes; “I think it behoves every-
one who has benefited by your remedy to give it
as much publicity as possible. Both I and my
husband have been severe sufferers from deranged
livers for the last five or six years. We consulted
doctors and used a number of advertised remedies
but without relief. At last a friend of ours sug-
gested a_ trial of Clements Tonic. We have now
been using it for several months, with the most
beneficial results; in fact, we have never felt so
well. for years as we have since taking Clements
Tonic. I feel only too happy to add my testimony
to the hundreds you already have received. —I
remain, yours gratefully, Ann Wickham.

The Age is saying very nice things

Dr. Wollaston, the new chief of Melbourne
Customs, has begun a system of buying up imports

It is a coincidence that Carruthers, M.P.,
who blocked the N.S.W. Electoral Bill being taken
as formal, has more plural votes in his constitu-
ency (Canterbury) than any other N.S.W.

Carruthers’ constituents are soulless allotments.
In a word, Carruthers represents nearly 50 per

Griffilwraith's plan for knocking working
men off the electoral-rolls works beautifully in the
outlying parts of Queensland. Before a man can
get his name on the roll, he has to swear an
affidavit before a magistrate that he possesses the
necessary qualification. On the Percy River,
N.Q., men have had to walk fourteen miles to
catch a magistrate. One truly admirable conse-
quence of the present arrangements is likely to be
a wide dissemination of the Holy Scriptures
among the bush heathens of Queensland. A ten-
dency of magistrates to be unable to put their
hand on their Bible when a workman comes to
swear an affidavit for electoral purposes has been
noticed.

Reid and Parkes rose together the other
evening in N.S.W. Assembly. Speaker Abbott
hardly knew whom to call on, but Reid gave w r ay

bygone custom is still strong in him. But Parkes
waved him on to speak, and rose when he con-
cluded. It is not yet.
The N.S.W. Upper House passed the
flogging bill with enthusiasm, and almost without
comment. The Upper House knows that any
pot-hatted, fat man in broadcloth from its ranks
could commit any legally - floggable act, from
abusing a child to torturing a horse, without the
least risk of being tied to the triangles. The lash
is only for the Lower Orders.
Granting that it was undesirable to try the
Broken Hill strikers at Broken Hill, it doesn’t
follow that it is specially desirable in the interests
of justice to try them at Deniliquin. The Bul-
letin leaves some democratic member to enlarge
on this subject in the N.S.W. Assembly. _ If the
venue must be shifted it should be shifted to
Sydney—for about 20 good reasons.
Bishop Moorhouse, it is cabled, says that
in Australia secular education has proved power-
less to diminish crime. The worst of the criminals,
lie remarks, are secularly well-educated. That is
one aspect of the matter. Another is that the
worst and most dangerous of the well-educated
criminals are the “pious” criminals—the land-
boom church-presidents and the godly lawyer-
thieves.

The N.S.W. Government evidently did
not choose to grasp the full significance of the fact
that their police were fed at Adelaide by the Em-
ployers’ Association. The plain fact of the matter
is that the enemies of a considerable body of
N.S. Wales citizens were allowed to banquet the
officers of justice. One of the police, writing
down from Broken Hill, says that the affair “ was
a perfect gorge—never had a feed like it! ” The
constables were provided with champagne before
they departed from Adelaide.
An English paper has unearthed the
following from the prayer-book of the Established
Church of 300 years ago:—
We heartily pray Thee to send Thy holy spirit into the
hearts of them that possess the grounds, pastures, and
dwelling-places on the earth; that they, remembering
themselves to be Thy tenants, may not rack and stretch
out the rents of their houses and lands ; nor yet take
unreasonable fines and incomes, after the manner of
covetous worldlings ; but so let them out to others that
the inhabitants thereof may be able to pay the rents and
also honestly to live, to nourish their family, and to
relieve the poor.
Sydney Daily Telegraph announces that
“British importers complain of over-stocks of
frozen meat which is being sold in the English
provinces for less than 3d. per lb.” This is
curious. The D.T. is always howling because
Protection leads to over-production and glutted
markets, and yet the markets of Freetrade Eng-
land seem to have got badly glutted. And the
same paper is always weeping because Protection
means enhanced prices, and yet Protectionist
Maoriland can send meat 16,000 miles and sell it
at 3d. per lb., and yet make a profit on the trans-
action.

When N.S.W. Legislative Council (at the
instance of the bogus-National Association —which
dares not fight in daylight, but is nobbling in the
dark the stertorous-breathing nominees of the
House of Liver Disease) inserts a “ thrift ” clause
in the Electoral Bill to knock pure manhood suff-
rage on the head and force a dissolution, the Minis-
try should meet them by boldly cutting out the
clause and tacking the Electoral Bill on to the
Appropriation Bill. Not a soul in the popular
chamber will dare to speak against pure manhood
suffrage, which principle was, so far as the present
Parliamentary system is concerned, decisively
affirmed at last general election. In view of the
recent Colonial-office decision as to the powers of
a Government over a nominee Council, the
Ministry holds a strong hand, which, it is to be
hoped, will be remorselessly used.
The chief features of Barton’s new N.S.W.
“Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Act of
1893 ” are : the re-arrangement of electoral boun-
daries every ten years, with alterations at a five
years’ interval in special cases; one-seat elec-
torates ; the abolition of expansive representation,
the .£4O deposit and nomination speeches ; the
limitation of representatives to 125; the popula-
tion basis of representation to be 2,200 voters with
a sliding scale of GOO above and 600 belovy that
number in order to overcome difficulties of
“ physical conformation ” or to accommodate
“ community of interests; ” none but gaoled
criminals, paupers, lunatics, aliens and women
will be disqualified from voting ; all elections will
be on one day—should that be a Saturday the
Jews’ religious scruples are considered the
nomadic and seafaring vote is looked after, and
provision is made for “marksmen” and blind
voters. Indeed, the Bill is evidently built up on
the good points of the previous Parkes and Dibbs
Bills.
Mr. Joseph Abbott started another vyhoop
about the beauties of private enterprise in the
N.S.W. Assembly last week, when he pointed
out that State life-insurance is a howling
absurdity, and that “no Government or Parlia-
ment could so well manage an insurance-fund as a
private company.” There is only, so far as we
know, one State insurance department at present
in existence anywhere —that of Maoiiland —which,
established just 21 years, has an annual revenue
of i2300,000, and is one of the most solid and pros-
perous institutions of its kind on earth —but,
probably, Abbott never heard of it. Also, fully
half the private insurance companies now extant
are sickly things which are always tottering on
the brink of bankruptcy, and the number that
have smashed is simply countless—but, pro-
bably, Abbott never heard of them either. The
things that Abbott hasn’t heard of are evidently
very numerous. Still, the Maoriland State Insur-
surance Department booms along in spite of him,
and it offers so many advantages over even the
best of the “private companies” that many
Australians who visit Maoriland now fetch a
policy away with them as a memento, and the
Australian Governments must, in the long run,
start rival institutions, if only to prevent Aus-
tralian money being drained off into Maoriland.

A scientific man, says the Scientific

among the poorest of the community.” We
observe in a general way that the absence of any-
thing approaching reckless improvidence in “the
boss ” usually has something to do with it.
The Australian daily newspapers appear to
unanimously approve of the new legal definition
of insanity propounded at the Medical Congress.
Yet during the trials of Colston, Deeming, John-
ston, and other recently-executed murderers,
when the question discussed at the Congress arose,
the same papers, judging by their silence on the
question, were as unanimously of opinion that the
law as it stands met all society’s requirements in
a just and civilised manner.
Pure Water.
The greatest necessity of every day life is pure
water. Two-thirds of one’s body is made up of
water. If the water we drink is impure, then
how can we hope to escape diseased conditions ?
It is impossible. The stomach, liver, and
kidneys cannot purify polluted water.
Some cautious people resort to the filter for
purifying this water, but even the filter does not
remove this poison, for water of the most deadly
character may pass through this filter and become
clear, yet the poison disguised is there.
They who use filters know that they must
become renewed at regular periods, for even
though they do not take out all the impurity,
they soon become foul.
Now in like manner the human kidneys act as
a filter for the blood, and if they are filled up with
impurities and become foul like the filter, all the
blood in the system coursing through them be-
comes bad, for it is now a conceded fact that the
kidneys are the chief means whereby the blood is
purified. These organs are filled with thousands
of hair-like tubes, which drain the impurities from
the blood, as the sswer pipes drain impurities
from our houses.
If a sewer pipe breaks under the house, the
sewage escapes into the earth and fills the house
with poisonous gas ; so, if any of the thousand and
one little hair-like sewer tubes of the kidneys break
down the entire body is affected by this awful
poison.
It is a scientific fact that the kidneys have few
nerves of sensation; and, consequently, disease
may exist in these organs for a long time and not
be suspected by the individual. It is impossible
to filter or take the death out of the blood when
the least derangement exists in these organs, and
if the blood is not filtered then the uric acid or
kidney poison, removable only by Warner’s Safe
Cure, accumulates in the system and attacks any
organ, producing nine out of ten ailments, just as
sewer gas and bad drainage produce so many
fatal disorders.
Kidney disease may be known to exist if there
is any marked departure from ordinary health
without appai’ent known cause, and it should be
understood by all that the greatest peril exists
and is intensified if there is the least neglect to
treat it promptly witli that great specific, War-
ner’s Safe Cure, a remedy that has received the
highest recognition by scientific men, who have
thoroughly investigated the character of kidney
derangements.
The liver, when deranged, immediately
announces the fact by sallow skin, constipated
bowels, coated tongue, and headaches; but the
kidney when diseased struggles on for a long
time, and the fact of its disease can only be dis-
covered by the aid of the microscope or by the
physician who is skilful enough to trace the most
indirect effects in the system to the derangement
of these organs as the prime cause.


WANTED—THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.
“ Adelaide, Wednesday.—A peculiar burial dispute took place yesterday at the
Mount Gambler cemetery. The deceased, who had been an ardent Freemason re-
nounced the order shortly before his death, and was received into the Roman
Catholic Church. At the cemetery yesterday two graves had been dug for the
remains, one in the Roman Catholic ground and the other in the Presbyterian
section. When the eortfege arrived at the cemetery, Father Hourigan claimed that
deceased should be buried in the Roman Catholic aground, while deceaseds friends
desired the remains to be placed in the Presbyterian, the Rev. R. A. Caldwell bein'*
present to officiate as the Presbyterian minister. Ultimately, a compromise was
.ome to." Not quite as depicted above, but it would have simplified matters.
“THEBE IS NO ESCAPING THIS

Sir Henry Parkes recently related to a reporter an anecdote,
)n confirmation of the dislike which the poet Tennyson had for
the gen.ns tourist .'< We had started out ovo morning' to
take a walk, Tennyson, without saying a word to me
started to run down the by-path through the gorsc, and ’
never stopped until he got right out of sirrht I
chased him with the best speed I could muster, and
I had my work to keep anything like near him,’ '’
i ir Wi lisro Manning snggests
that it is inadvisable to give, the
po!icc“’an too much protection, so
rs to ’Tnpart .a kind of sacredness
to his person.

The .King of Dahomey’s Amazons are a body of about iOOO
women, who are armed with muskets, bows, razors fixed in
handles, and knives. Their costume in Burton’s time consisted
of a blue and white sleeveless surtout, a skirt or tunic and a pair
of short trousers reaching a couple of inches below the knee. Mr.
Duncan, the African traveller, says of the Amazons ; * Their
appearance is more martial than the generality of the men, and if
undertaking a campaign I should prefer the female to the malo
soldiers of this country.’ ”

As the world still remembers the recent
disgraceful cases of blackmailing by London
financial “organs,” which seem to be run mainly
by unscrupulous “ backsheesh ” bandits, of the
well-barbered-bookmaker type, why do the Aus-
tralian dailies continue to nauseate us with cables
to the effect that the London Financial News,
&c., &c., approve of the arrest of the Broken Hill
strikers ?

Fink, the Melbourne man who rose from
receiving 30s. a week to paying a halfpenny in the
.£ on over a million of debt, lived in that fine
mansion, corner of St. Kilda Road and Domain
Road, built by the Victorian Government for
General Chute, as Commander-in-Chief, after his
triumphant return from squelching the Maoris,
when he married a young wife, and apparently
fancied himself in clover for the rest of his
existence.

Halfpennies get more and more into cir-

A Bulletin correspondent tells us that a
Hillgrove (N.S.W.) man was lately fined for not
sending his wife to school. She is only 13 years
of age, and he 22. This ought to be a caution
against men marrying young girls.

The “cliqueism ” trouble about which the
Australasian Medical Congress heard so much on
the first day of session was, to call a spade a
spade, simply a phase of the old Sydney trouble
between the Irish doctors and Scotch doctors.

The white-souled civfc fathers of Adelaide

The Geelong parson who shut up his
church on tha “ Sawbath ” evenings because “ it
only furnished an excuse for young people of both
sexes to meet under the cover of darkness,” was a
fool. The Synod which heard his assertion spent
most of its time crying about the great falling off
in the marriage fees.

Up North a Kanaka named Joe developed
signs of leprosy—and was duly yarded. He
e map id and was recaptured, but again endeavoured
to get away. This time he was caught by a con-
stable, and in the struggle he bit and tore the
constable’s legs and face. Ugh! Two doctors are
legally required to certify to leprosy, and as there
was no one thereabout who could act with the local
doitor, some skin was scraped off the unfortunate
wretch and forwarded to Brisbane for micro-
scopical examination. It proved to be truly
leprous, and Joe goes to life-long imprisonment at
Friday Island. What about the bitten police-
man ? The Kanakilgriff curse comes apace.
# # #
Significant item from a Sydney daily : —
A sign of the times in Sydney is the initiation of a
bankers’ prayer-meeting. With a minister who was
formerly a bank manager as its president, and a com-
mittee of “out-and-out” fellows at its head, says the
Methodist Gazette, “quite a number of bank officials, by
n ) means confined to the juniors, meet for prayer, Bible-
study and consecration. One of the leading banks in
Oeorge-street basso many earnest followers of Christ on
its staff, that it is now spoken of amongst kindred institu-
tions as the Christian bank.”
“ A sign of the times!” Yes. Also, it is character-
istic of the average “ follower ” that his cash won’t
square, and that he goes away the night before
the audit. The Bulletin doesn’t want to make
any trouble at present so it refrains from giving
the name of the bank, but some day perhaps this
paper will point out the institution in question,
and then there will be a mad rush of depositors
and the management will have to heave the
earnest followers down the front steps to pacify the
raging mob. The old Roman fashion of throwing
the alleged Christian to the wild animals is extinct,
but the time is pretty near when he will have to
be thrown to the depositors instead, and probably,
if he could sample the two, he might prefer the
animals. And just here a chance comes in
for a great allegorical picture, which will be
partly ancient and partly modern—the second
century and the nineteenth combined. Instead
of the amphitheatre, and the Believer with
the rag round his middle waiting to be eaten by
the tawny king of beasts, let there be a bank in
the background with a notice in the window that
payment is temporarily suspended, and the
Christian in a collar and a shiny hat being cast
out of the front door, while the lion with an over-
due deposit-receipt tied to his tail waits for him
on the pavement. Asa method of crowding all
the facts into a very small space we don’t think
this could be improved on, much.

Memorial of Sir Mab. Davies. At Mal-
vern, Melb., the elements have providentially
spared a poster on a fence. It is dated December
last, and sets forth the attractions of a grand
bazaar, at St. John’s Church, to be opened at 3
o clock by the Hon. Sir M. 11. Davies, Speaker of
the Legislative Assembly. Sir M.H. now gets
quite rusty on religious gatherings, which used to
fill half his time. VVhy isn’t he as good as ever he
was?—oh why, you miserable, lucre-loving
traffickers in the temple ?
* * *
The great dress question crops up in all
sorts of queer directions. The N.S.W. Judges
opened last term in full-bottomed wigs and lovely
scarlet petticoats, and it would have been “con-
tempt ” to laugh at them. At Parliament opening
Governor Jersey wore a billy-cock hat with
feathered edges, and a coat all frogged over with
gold lace, while the President of the Council and
the Speaker had black gowns and white bibs and
big wigs. The Sergeant-at-Arms and the spindle-
shanked Usher of the Black Rod had special
caparisons. Mr. Hutchinson, M.P. for Glen
Innes, “one of the most remarkable men in our
country, sir,"’ rose to address the bewigged
Speaker one night wearing a black skull cap, and
noticing the Speaker about to call him to order,
snatched it off with a scared celerity, exposing a
perfectly treeless fly-parade.

At Melbourne District Court last week a
barrister asked, in accents of acutest horror,
whether it was a fact that respectable men —men
of respectability, you understand —had been cap-
able of wishing to satisfy a morbid desire to see a
certain notoriously immoral book. The witness
said that such was the case, whereupon the bar-

utterably surprised and shocked. This sort of
thing begins to make the world very tired.
# # #
A number of the reverend members of the
Synodal Assembly held in Melbourne recently
were in favour of reducing the fee for marriages,
as the competition of the “cheap and nasty
clergyman ” is monopolising the cream of the
business, and quite ruining the Anglican Church
trade; —
Big cigars, such as the Prince of Wales
gave to the late Mr. Dibbs, are all the fashion in
London, and can be seen in any first-class
tobacconist shop. They run to 10 inches in length,
and cost as much as a crown each. Weeds of
those dimensions may suit Sir George well enough,
but when Tummy smokes one he must look, at a
•distance, not unlike a Dutch galliot with a frigate’s
bowsprit. The reason why the big cigars are
fashionable is, no doubt, because “the Prince”
smokes them. Half the girls in England hobbled,
a dozen years ago, because the Princess of Wales
had a hip-trouble and limped. Alexandra deserves
the thanks of every person of taste for the wigs,
and pads, and teeth she wears. If she took the
fancy to appear in public as age and illness have
left her, the young men of to-day would have to
take their pick among the crowd of bald, tooth-
less, and scraggy maidens.

Melbourne is unfortunate in the magni-
tude and monotony of its sensations. For some
weeks there was nothing but Deeming on the
tapis, and for more weeks since there has been
little beside Davies to fill the gap left by the dead
gentleman. The women insisted on talking
Deeming, and the men can’t be dragged away
from Davies. Looming in the distance is the
dark shadow of Jimmy Munro, also a bonne-
bouche for the males, so the ladies are not likely
to have another conversational innings this year.
If Clara Parker pops up once more —she seems to
be lost again in the meantime—she will clash with
the Cup most likely, and excite no interest worth
mentioning.

One of the queerest and most annoying, yet
withal most characteristic, compositorial mistakes
made for a long while has just been achieved by
the Sydney Morning Herald, which, in quoting
from Tennyson’s “ Crossing the Bar,” the line—
But such a tide as moving seems asleep
made it read—
But such a tide as snorin'j seems asleep.
Which ghastly misprint must, of course, occur in
relation to the very best line in the poem.
# # #
The proper course of true love is, as shown
by a Sydney insolvent, for a man to settle all his
worldly possessions on his wife just before marry-
ing her. A love-smitten Sydney jeweller did this
foolish act on 24th February, transferring 38 acres
of land on the Nepean, some suburban allotments,
some newspaper-company shares (!), some build-
ing-society scrip, some pawn-broking interests,
some mining paper, &c., &c., to his Elizabeth
Jane. Twelve days later he married his desire.
Then he transferred all his jeweller’s stock-in-trade
over to the wife of his bosom. Yet was she
scarcely the wife of his bosom, for she lived with
hergrandad in the suburbs, while hebachelorised in
the city. No wonder he went bankrupt ! And
the irony of his fate was that he had to take a
billot as a working jeweller at £2 a week, his boss
being his own wife. As he told these things to
the Insolvency Registrar, and as Elizabeth Jane
confirmed the same with her simple statement—
“ Yeth thir, it wath alwayth agreed thinth the
time I wath engaged that everything wath to be
thettled on me !” —that prosaic official winked the
other eye. Marriage is a business failure.
The extraordinary popularity of Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the natural result of its use by all
classes of people for over forty years. It lias
proven itself the very best specific for colds,
Coughs, and pulmonary complaints.
Most of the influential Hebrews of Sydney
appear to be busy just now writing letters of
protest to the local Daily Telegraph. The
trouble began with a paragraph in the paper’s
“Religious ” column concerning certain ceremonies
alleged to be performed by the Tribes on the Day
of Atonement, and winding up with the astound-
ing statement that, “Neither leather nor gold
ornaments are allowed to be worn during these
services, and many wear only stockings or cloth
boots in the Synagogue.” The idea of a large
congregation dressed only in stockings or cloth
boots promptly aroused Rabbi Davis, who repudi-
ated the practices described, and stated that they
belonged to the dark ages of superstition. Then
Rabbi Davis aroused Mi 1 . Lewis Abramowitch
(who, if we mistake not, is a Christian Hebrew),
who endorsed the D.T.’s statement, and added ;
The Jews (except the Reformed section, which date
from Dr. Geiger, 1845, and the few so-called orthodox, hut
are not orthodox) take on the morning of the ninth day
of Tishri fowls, and after morning prayer bind their legs
and twist them around their own heads, repeating in
Hebrew three times the words, “ This is my, atonement,
this is my substitute, this is my commutation. This cock
(or hen) goes to death, but may I go and be gathered into
life and peace.” If anyone is too poor to afford fowls he
is allowed to do with as much money as he can afford that
which he would do with the fow ls, and then distribute
half of that money among the poor, while for the rest he
is to buy the needful food for the day.
Tins is interesting, and it must be a touching
spectacle to see the large, fat bookmakers all
whirling roosters about their heads in the Syna-
gogue, At the same time, it isn’t very explicit,
for it seems to imply that the poorer Jews whirl a
sum of money round instead of a rooster, having
first tied the legs of the cash together—at h ast
Mr. Abramowitch’s remarks appear to point that
way. Several other influential Hebrews have
now joined in the shindy, and die impression they
leave behind them is that the Chosen are getting a
good deal mixed about their own creed, and don’t
know for certain whether the fowl ought to be
whirled or not. Next time the Day of Atonement
comes round we intend, if possible, to personally
investigate the point, and to be on the spot early.
If the fowl story is true, the show ought to be
wortli seeing, for in a case like this it is certain to
be the smallest Jew who brings the biggest
rooster, and if the Jew is only small enough the
chances are that he will bring an ostrich. Also,
most of the Hebrews we know have had much
practice at waving on high the skinned lamb
about Melbourne Cup time, and it would be inter-
esting to see them tackling the domestic hen for a
change.

“ Phil Lorrimer, the Australian bush poet
and nomad,” says Kiama (N.S.W.) Independent,

plimented him on his poetry.” “ Tew mutch ”! —
A certain Northern bishop, although not
a Scotchman, has a keen eye for business. A
modest bush pub. at Emerald (Q.) recently had
the honour of entertaining the ecclesiastical digni-
tary for a couple of days. On taking leave of
mine host, his lordship remarked: “O! thank
you so much for your kind hospitality. lam
aware that yon never charge the clergy anything”
—and, with a bland smile and benedictionary
wave of the hand, departed. Boniface, to recoup
himself for loss, has since been reluctantly com-
pelled to “take it out of” the poorer vessels of
the Lord whom the tide of duty has drifted
thitherwards. Of such is the kingdom of
bishops !

Redfern and Alexander, the big Anglo-
Australian firm which has just burst up, has been
going downhill for a long time. First, old Mr.
Alexander, who, if we do not mistake, was once
connected with Gilchrist, of Sydney, cleared out
with a very large fortune ; then W. M. Redfern,
who is so well known on the English turf, did
ditto; then Van der Byl, a cousin of the Oloetes,
and a Cape Boer by birth, followed suit, having,
Whittington-liko, married the daughter of the head
of the house, Mr. Alexander, thus leaving a sole
partner, James Alexander, who has just come to
grief. The firm has been lately more interested in
Maoriland than Australia, and the losses will, to a
great extent, fall upon people in the former country.
Latterly Redfern and Alexander went in for com-
pany-promoting, and underwrote a lot of shares in
the over-capitalised Day Dawn Block and Wynd-
ham, of which James Alexander is a director. He
is also a director of the Isis Investment Co. of
Queensland, of the Land and Loan Company of
Maoriland, and of the Bank of Australasia. The
original Redfern gave the name to Sydney’s
populous suburb.

The English papers devote columns to the
incident of labour-member Keir Hardie wearing a
cloth cap in that hitherto curled and scented club,
the House of Commons, The length and depth
of the Hardie’s blasphemy can only be understood
by those who have seen the Englishman at ’Ome.
J. Bull firmly believes that the Supreme Being
wears a “nail-kag ” on its ’ead. As Bull traverses
the slushy foot-paths of his grimy city, he dives
into hatters’ shops, at intervals of about 200 yards,
to get his ’at hironed up. Likewise, Bull prays
to his hat in church.
At last it’s reached the Church’s door,
The curse of competition ;
The cleric's fees are cut, and, more,
He’s “ run out ” of the mission,
lie feels the pinch of evils grim
Just like his “grafting ” neighbour,
And sympathises now with him
Against Kanaka labour.
Some carnal men at quarter rates
Are tying pairs in marriage,
For half the fees, one brother states,
They find a nobby carriage.
The Church that always grabbed the loot
Is hoist on her own derrick
And dismally she follows suit.
But hates the blackleg cleric.
The gentleman whose frugal mind
Induces him to tarry,
By lowered rates may he inclined
To buckle to and marry.
We favour much the smaller fee
The cheaper parson forces—
The money saved will useful be
In paying for divorces.
Oh, Lady Shadow of the Guelph !
You are a poetess yourself ;

With “ some loaf-sugar ” for a turn
That surely cried aloud for rum?
Oh, d !
How does a poet feel, d’you think,
With one “ good meal,” without a drink ?

Had you but kept the “compliment”—

When are Spectacles ICequired ?
When the eyes water or become so much fatigued by
short exercise as to be obliged to be frequently closed or
relieved by viewing different objects.
When objects cannot be seen without removing them
to an increased distance.
When the letters of a book appear to blend with one
another.
When more light is necessary than was formerly, as
When the candle is placed between the eye and the

When much difficulty is found in threading a needle ;
When the eyes appear as if they had a mist before

When black specks seem floating in the sight.

The Australian Church, Melb., is in Queer-

When a new phrenologist turns up in Mel-
bourne, one of the evening organs is sure to turn
him loose upon “prominentmen.” The Standard
is at it now. This is an aAvful waste of time and
space. The public wants no such character read-
ings ; the characters of prominent men have
become only too evident of late. Boom is more
eloquent than bump.
It is the chief mission of an attractive
Avoman to beguile the old fat man to his undoing.
Recently in Maoriland a very pretty little woman
wanted to secure a profitable post in the leading
school of a Northern town. The local committee,
which had the bestowal of the appointment, con-
sisted of seven unctuous old gentlemen, and the
applicant visited them all, and asked for their
support. Six of them tickled her under the chin,
and the other one leered amorously at her and
gasped. Then the applicant explained that she
was a stranger in the place and friendless, and
that if she got the appointment she must arrange
to board in a highly respectable family, and all
the seven committee-men agreed to take her in,
either from purely business motives or because
they wanted to have her on the premises so that
they could leer at her at all hours of the day. She
got the appointment unanimously—the committee
voted for her like one unctuous old man, without
a shadow of dissent. Whereupon she moved into
the town and proceeded to lodge at a house where
a bony widow advertised, “Beds, one shilling,”
and not one committee-man dared complain lest she
should expose him to the other six, so she is prac-
tically mistress of the situation. They are tired
of pretty female teachers now, and the next school-
marm in these parts will be a haggard spinster in
green goggles,

Announcement in an Auckland (M.L.)
shop Avindow : “ Goods removed, messages taken,
carpets beaten, and poetry composed on any sub-
ject.” Probably the poetry wants to be beaten a
lot harder than the carpets.
Sydney can boast of her George Matcham
Pitt, a portly and amiable gentleman, whose
knowledge of the poets is extensive and peculiar,
and who occasionally sends incoherent letters to
the Evening News. England boasts of her
George Pitt too, of Mitcham, in his way quite an
oddity. Recently, on the occasion of the coming
of age of his son, the English George Pitt gave a
most extraordinary feast to the inhabitants of
Mitcham, after which he distributed a large
number of prizes for almost everything under the
sun. There Avas a prize for the tallest man and
the shortest man, for the tallest woman and the
shortest, for the oldest and the youngest person
on the ground, for the one Avith the longest hair
and the largest feet—male and female—for those
who had been longest married, and for the newest
bride and bridegroom. There was one for the
fastest runner and one for the slowest, for the
couple Avho had quarrelled least during their
married life, for those Avith the largest family, for
the fattest and biggest baby, with a consolation
prize for the tiniest. He gave, in fact, something
to everybody and for anything. Needless to say
that the tramps got wind of the affair, and came
from far and near, and helped to make up a scene
such as is rarely seen in any country.
Birth notice from a Mauritius paper :
Birth.— Gaston Prokop Miroslaw de Tamowsky, on his
visit to earth—waking on the cares and troubles of this
world, but just now enjoying affectionate tenderness in a
picui mother’s arms—begs his name to be written in the
Book of Life.—New Grouc-Mare d’Albert, 18 IV. 02, at
0.15 p.m;
There is real poetic feeling in that little “ad.”
And yet the stolid Anglo-Saxon never realises the
possibilities of sucli an event, and keeps on making
his announcement in the old, stolid way : “ At 10
Biggs Alley, Botany, the wife of John Smith of a
son.”
At the nigger-infested town of Mackay
(N.Q.) it is proposed to turn the disused Kanaka
hospital into a boys’ school. It is the general
idea in official circles that the mouldy, disease-
laden, leprous tenement Avhere the Polynesians
used to rot away, and develope curious and
horrible complaints, is just the place where the
young Queenslander could receive a healthy and
liberal education with advantage; but the tovvns-
people object, and the controversy will probably
end with the combustion of the offensive barn
some dark night. A dirty, but economical Govern-
ment is the Queensland Coalition. It would
sooner turn a leper station into a cathedral than
have it wasted.
Dr. Huxfcable doesn’t believe in strychnia
for snakebite. Fear, he says, is responsible for
most alarming snakebite symptoms, and, in most
cases, a healthy adult will recover frorn snakebite
without being treated at all. Which brings to
mind an experience of the present writer’s. A lot
of us were in a Queensland mining-camp years
ago, and stayed up late at night playing cards. A
billy of water was Avanted, and Joe Ogle, a sturdy
miner, Avent down to the creek barefooted to get
it. On returning, he said he thought he had been
bitten by a snake, but as snakes were at that time
out of season, Ave (and ultimately he) concluded
he had been mistaken, though on Ids calf were tAvo
marks that looked very like a bite. He at the
time felt no ill-effects, his heart beat strongly and
steadily, and he went to his bunk. By-and-bye, a
mate who slept in the same hut, found him dead.
Yet he Avas a strong man, in the prime of life, and
one Avho, if he felt any fear, certainly on no occa-
sion betrayed it. Snakebite, as bushmen having
experience of the unsettled regions know, will kill
strong, healthy blacks. And if snakebite will kill
blackfellows Avith sound nervous systems and free
from the thrall of the Avhite man’s artificial fear,
it Aviil very likely kill the Avhite man, no matter
hoAV healthy he may be.

N.S.W. Railway Commissioner Oliver has
just confided to the public that Chief Commis-
sioner Eddy has “on very many occasions ” been
on the point of resigning owing to the malevolent
and unfounded charges made against him. How-
ever, His Nibs has managed to bear up on his
official salary of <£.3000 a year. Mr. Eddy should
take for his example the model publican, who
makes it a rule of business never to be seen in his
own bar, where he gives the flirty Hebe full sway.
Mr. Eddy 3 s Hebe is, or ought to be, Commissioner
Eehon, who, like the Chief himself, is honest and
competent and devoted to business. But Eehon
knows how to talk to the boys over the counter,
and Eddy simply doesn’t. The Chief Commis-
sioner is a foreigner in Australia, and, like Joe
Holds worth the poet, he was born in a black bell-
topper. The workmen resent Eddy’s nasty,,
cvnical, formal, frock-coat, imported manners,
lie means well, no doubt, but wherever he goes;
he carries with him a Philistinio atmosphere.
Eehon, like Eddy, comes from the ranks, but lie
has not lost touch with the ranks. When ex-
Oommissioner Goodchap was in office he used to
make Bill Smith, the engine-cleaner, feel that he
was abrother as well as a boss. Eehon, a less refined
man than Goodchap, but just as hard-headed, can
swear at Bill Smith in Bill Smith’s own lingo, and
Bill would sooner be cordially sworn at by Eehon
than he would be fitted with a halo by Commis-
sioner Eddy. These are facts that can’t be got
over. Let the Chief Commissioner stay in the
office and savagely chew his pen-handles.

Now that Home Rule is booming the Irish

just as winter is at hand. If they don’t resist they

A Maoriland lawyer lately sued a hcavs-
paper for libel. Here is a hunk from defendant’s
pleadings. “ Something like pleadings,” Ave hear
you say :
Plaintiff is of filthy habits, and persons have had to
quit a public dinner-table owing to his presence ; that the
plaintiff is continuously so full of alcoholic fluid that
during a period of two years a person who promised to
treat him the first time he was sober has been unable to
do so ; that the plaintiff uses expletives and his voice is
not euphonic; that the plaintiff when comparatively
sober lapses into a maudlin and pitiful state ; that the
appearance of the plaintiff is extravagantly dilapidated,
caused fly his wearing clothes he has begged for; that the
habits of the plaintiff are so filthy that they render his
person offensive to all persons, whether easily moved at
sickening objects or not; that the plaintiff has slept in a
stable ; that the plaintiff has slept in a pigstye ; that the
plaintiff has slept in a drain or culvert; that the plaintiff
does not use Pears’ soap; that the plaintiff does meander
about iii a most aimless manner and smokes an occasional
cigarette ; that the plaintiff does importune for drink and
matches or tobacco; that the plaintiff also importunes
for money and clothes; that the plaintiff is at banquet,
ball, or concert an intolerable nuisance ; that the plaintiff
has been frequently fined and imprisoned for offences
against public order; that the plaintiff has so behaved
himself in Courts of Justice as to injure himself and his
clients and to bring the Court into the contempt of all
right-minded persons.
Verdict for one farthing.
Some years back, after
the jollification attendant
upon the opening of a back-
country railway, the en-
thusiastic M.P. for the dis-
trict suddenly “ came a
cropper ” through the ap-
pearance of a pretty gin,
who, with a picaninny in her
arras, approached the jovial
crew on the. hotel verandah.
“What a handsome gin !”
exclaimed a noAV Minister
of the Crown. “ Yes,”
chimed in one of the pioneer
squatters, whose daughter
had not been long married,
to the M.P. in question,
“and I knew her when she
Avas a picaninny herself.”
“Thisbabee—no picaninny,”
interposed. the mother Avith
her eyes riveted on the
reputed father. “AnclAvhat
is the boy’s name? ” inquired
a remorseless legislator Avith
a twinkle in his eye. The
gin’s ans Aver was a crusher
for the straight-laced
squatter and his son-in-laAV.
Two “pals” met in
the old (Sydney Central
Police-court cells, upon dis-
tinct charges, one as serious
as the other Avas trivial.
The one Avho was allotted a
fine or seven, days, generously
“ pulled his mate out of
the fire ” by simply agreeing
to the “ringing of the
changes,” on their names
being ' called at the gaol.
Next day the remanded
man ..was discharged, his
mate’s fine having been paid
according to arrangement,
and, to the amazement of the gaol authorities, the
wrong man was duly produced when the remand
was called. Great was the discomfiture of the
D.’s, who had a strong case.
Characteristic item from Southern Cross,

A party of three men made a start this morning. Th e
team they are supposed to accompany started two day ß
ago; they are in pursuit now, armed with bottles o f
whisky, a bottle of water, and one cake.

when the popular election is as unimpeded as the coursing
of the blood in a healthy body, the Jew shall be foremost
and topmost, for he is pre-eminently by comparison the

That is it —the Gentile's masters in mental arith-

Dear Bulletin, —Many of our Australian
writers persist in speaking of the “Tea-tree” as
the “Ti ” tree, and as the inaccuracy has received
qwm-scientific sanction (vide Dendy and Lucas’s
“Introduction to the Study of Botany,” pp 225
and 227, just published), perhaps it would be as
well to re-define the correct use of the word. The
true Ti-tree or plant is “ Cordyline Ti ” of the
Lily family which furnishes the Sandwicli
Islanders with part of their food. Species of
Cordyline are found in Asia, Polynesia, Maoriland,
Norfolk Island and New South Wales, and the
true “Ti” is Cordyline Terminalis. The first
shrub called “Tea-tree” in this part of the world
was Lcptospermum Scoparium of the Myrtle
family. The leaves of it were used for tea by the
sailors of Captain Cook’s expedition, and also by
the seamen, marines and convicts of the First
Fleet—hence it j popular name. The term, how-
ever, is now applied to the genus Lcptospermum
generally, and also the allied genus Melaleuca. A
Tea-tree scrub includes species of both genera.
Baron Mueller pointed out the mistake some time
ago, and the Rev. Dr. Woolls has also done good
service in popularising the historic form of the
word.—Yours, Prick Warp no.

JJEAUTIPUL SPRING
At this season of the year Nature puts on a new garb,
and there is a general all-round exhilaration. Upon the
human system this sudden change has very marked
effects, and great care is necessary in keeping all the
machinery of the body in good working order. No piece
of mechanism will of its own accord, always run freely,
but must have constant attention, and as a lubricant is to
an engine so is “ Karana ” to an individual. At no time
of the year are there so many petty ailments as during
spring tide, and the system requires good overhauling.
Mother Mary Joseph Aubert has found that Karana is the
required tonic, and it is recommended as a faithful friend
to all persons. A cheerful disposition is assured to all
those who partake of this splendid remedy.
“ TTAWKES BAY HERALD,” September 14, 1891. "It
is quite safe to say that there is no more widely
known or respected woman in Hawkes Bay than Sister
Mary Joseph, nor one whose efforts for the relief of the
Buffering sick have been more successful. During her
long stay in this colony (over 30 years) Sister Mary Joseph
has devoted herself to the discovery and utilisation of the
medicinal virtues with which onr New Zealand flora is so
lavishly endowed. The result of her researches has been
so successful that hundreds of families in Hawkes Bay
have had reason to bless Sister Mary Joseph’s long stay in
this province. Her remedies ultimately achieved a more
than local fame, not only in this colonyi hut also in Aus-
tralia, and at last the demand for them so increased that
it became necessary for a business firm to take the matter
of distribution in hand.

Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.

IHE DAWNING OF THE TRUTH,
No great enterprise was ever crowned with
success until it had met and vanquished, or lived
down, discouragement, unbelief, and popular
opposition. The experience of the Waterbury
Watch Company has been no exception to this
rule. The watches made by this company were
derided by the press and the public; still, they
kept good time, despite careless usage, and
although sneered at by paragraphists and associ-'
ated in the popular mind with cheap chromos and
poor clothing, they earned for themselves the
reputation of being the only reliable low-cost
time-keepers in the market. From one step of
excellence the company proceeded to another—
from the “long-wind” to the “short-wind”—
adding an enamel dial and an improved stem-
setting attachment, which latter is second to none
for both convenience and celerity. Beginning the
“short-wind” with the Series “J,” in a nickel
case, they followed with the Series “L,” a six
size, for ladies and youths. The next step was
the production of Series “K,” eighteen size, for
gentlemen, with a double-sunk enamel dial, and
equipped in nickel, sterling silver, and rolled gold
cases. Then they brought out the Series “N,”
four size, for ladies, a little beauty with nickel,
sterling silver, and rolled gold cases, and with
both full and chatelaine dials. To-day the word
“ Waterbury ” is synonymous with excellence and
economy. People who used to sneer at the words
“Waterbury Watches” now point to a beauti-
fully engraved case containing an honest and
reliable time-keeping movement, and when queried
as to its make, say with honest pride, “Only a
Waterbury, but a Waterbury that I am not
ashamed of; a splendid timekeeper, and only
costs a trifle.” The revolution has begun and the
word “Waterbury” is already receiving justice
at the hands of those who lately sneered at it.
The truth is dawning upon the masses, and the
real worth of the Waterbury Watches has
triumphed over misrepresentation and past popm
lar misapprehension.

Why?
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Why do the workers grumble go?
Because they have been thinking !
They did not "murmur,” long a^o.
No, then they were not thinking.
Why do the "pastors ” preach less Hell?
Because the “ flocks ’’ are thinking
Of “ brimstone fires ” they used to tell—
But now~they have been thinking.
Why don’t the Nations go to war?
Because they’re busy thinking
What should they kill each other for ?
That’s what “ brave ” men are thinking.

Concentrated Sunshine.
Concentrated sunshine is acknowledged to be
Nature’s great remedy for all the ills that human
flesh is heir to. In no part of the world is the
remedy, in rays pure and serene, more freely
lavished than in New Zealand. The sunshine
playing on a clear, salubrious atmosphere has left
its impression on the fauna and flora of the colony.
The extinct moa, and wondrous coal deposits, pro-
claim the natural wealth of old New Zealand.
The muscular Maori and the splendid forests
survive. From these forests Mother Mary Aubert
has compounded several important remedies, and
we recommend the announcements elsewhere to
the perusal not simply of the sick, but of those in
health. “A stitch in time saves nine” applies to
the healing art more than to less important matters.
Mother Mary Aubert's New Zealand Remedies
are preventive as well as curative. When the first
symptoms of sickness appear, their power, in
cutting short the attack by rousing dormant
organs and functions to activity, is said to be
remarkable. Insidious ailments resemble the
burglar, but these remedies promptly applied give
the alarm and make him decamp. There is no
quackery about them, they are not foreign com-
pounds of which people know nothing, and which
may be pernicious, but they are the pure products
of New Zealand sunshine distilled through the
vegetable kingdom. Better than all, their
character has been proved- for they have been well
tested, and the best proof of their merits is that
their sale is rapidly increasing.
Auckland Stab, May 7, 1892.
MOTHER AUBERT’S REMEDIES.
In these days of patent medicines it requires
that certificates of excellence should be signed by
the names of persons of standing in the com-
munity. The herbal remedies put up by the
Rev. Mother Mary Joseph Aubert, of Jerusalem,
Wanganui River, have already been highly spoken
of, and elsewhere will be seen an advertisement
which publishes in full the testimony of such
eminent personages as Lord Onslow, Bishop
Grimes, of Christchurch, Bishop Redwood, of
Wellington, and, passing from pulpit to stage,
Mr. Walter Bentley. The latter acknowledges
the wonderful result to his voice from using
MARUpA.
Another preparation designated
KARANA
Is said to be equal to combating most of the ills of
life, and restores a broken-down constitution. It
is a vegetable tonic, pleasant to take, and by no
means hurtful in its action.
Obtainable everywhere.
It has been said “many a time and oft” that
no prophet hath honour in Ids own country, but
experience has not proved that this statement is
invariably correct. For instance, was Beacons-
field without honour? Is Gladstone without
honour? Is 11. M. Stanley without honour? Is
Bismarck, the ‘‘man of blood and iron,” without
honour?—he has now, alas! somewhat fallen from
his former high estate, but still he has honour !
Coming nearer home, are Mr. Ballance, Sir Robert
Stout, Sir John Hall, or Mr. Rolleston, without
honour? No, none of these are without honour,
and rightly so, too, for all have some qualities
deserving of the highest commendation. But the
person entitled to the highest honour, esteem, and
respect is he who endeavours to alleviate in some
measure the sufferings of mankind. Such an one
is Mother Mary Joseph Aubert, the discoverer of
the now famous Aubert Remedies, “Paramo,”
“Karana,” “Natanata,” and “Marnpa.” There
are many who scoff at what are called “patent
medicines,” but let it be remembered that there
are patent medicines and Patent medicines. The
Aubert Remedies are the theme of universal praise
—and why? Because they are not mere quack
decoctions, but are pure herbal medicines prepared
solely from New Zealand plants, the medicinal
values of which, for various complaints, have been
accurately ascertained after years of patient and
laborious research. Not only in New Zealand but
in Australia has the fame of these preparations
become universally known, and it is confidently
asserted that no medicines have achieved such
instantaneous success as the Aubert Remedies.
AN
INGENIDUS
MEANS
OF RNYNC
THE
NIND
OOME time ago a smart man raked in a goodly
pile of dollars by means of a speciously,
worded advertisement to the following effect;
“ The Complete Art of Riding. Full instructions
how to ride well and gracefully will be sent to any
address. Send ss. to Centaur, Daily Telegraph
office.
A large number of aspiring equestrians remitted
the needful, but instead of the quarto volume they
expected, all they received was half a sheet of
notepaper upon which was written the following
trite advice: “ Your head and your heart keep
up, your hands and your heels keep down, your
legs keep close to your horse’s sides, your arms
keep close to your own.”
Although in one sense it was a “take-in,” still
the advice given is undeniable. It is a multum in
parvo, and certainly anyone capable of following
the instructions would out a very good figure on
horseback. Useful information so condensed is
far more valuable than pages of prosy instructions,
as it is retained in the mind and easily remem-
bered at the right time. A book containing pithy
compressed instructions on general subjects would
be invaluable and command a ready sale. Follow-
ing on the above advice, how useful a couplet
would be containing complete instructions on the
treatment of the horse. How often this faithful,
willing quadruped suffers, not from want of care,
but from want of knowledge on the part of the
owner as to the treatment of the animal. Some
owners, of course, who have been familiar with
horses from their youth and are naturally fond of
them, are able to'see in a moment when anything
is wrong with a horse, and can diagnose the case
almost as well as a veterinary surgeon. Not only
so, but they know the proper treatment, and are
not tied down by old-fashioned notions, and often
effect a cure by original means where old-world
remedies have proved of no avail. The following
instance, which is a ease in point, and which we
give for the benefit of our readers, comes from
Mr. Thos. H. Harrison, cab owner, Ruthven-
street, Randwick. He says : “ A horse of mine
suffered from strained sinews in his front legs,
and was quite lame. I applied various embroca-
tions, but none of them did any good. Having
heard of the wonderful cures made by St. Jacobs
Oil on human beings in cases of strains, sprains,
&c., I thought I would try it on my horse. I
bathed his legs in warm water and then care
fully applied the oil at intervals, and sure enough
in a couple of days his legs were as firm as ever.”

Dear Bulletin, —I have already forwarded
to the newspaper making the original remark a
correction of the statement you repeat that the
present Earl of Limerick was born at Norfolk
Island, “ to which place his fattier had been tran-
sported.” The fact is very different. The present
Earl’s father, then the Hon. W. H. C. T. Pery,
was, at the time of his son’s birth, second magis-
trate and Superintendent of Agriculture at Nor-
folk Island--a position that he took so as to allow
his estate to be “nursed” for the benefit of his
son. I think the correction should be made, not
because I am particularly anxious to remove a
slur from the aristocracy—which, by the way, was
represented by many very distinguished scoun-
drels among the felonry of the Island —but to do
justice to the memory of a man who sought to
strengthen Captain Maconochie’s hands when he
tried to humanely administer the Government of
die “Hell of the Waters.” Of all the superior
officials on the Island, Pery was the only man who
helped and did not impede the one heroic endea-
vour made during the penal epoch to elevate the
transported felon to the level of average humanity.
—Yours, Price Warung.
The following letter from a youth in
Sydney was received recently by a Northern
Territory squatter, who has sent it along to The
Bulletin
Dear Sir,—Can you give me a billet? If you cannot
then do you know of any Cattle Station in any part of the
northern territory of any of the Colonies that can ? lam
prepared to rough it. I want one with hard, brisk, horse-
iding. The more riding there is the better. I,am not
if raid of hard, work. I would do wood-splitting or any
u her heavy work provided there is a lot of brisk horse-
iding as well. Slow horse-riding will not do ; it must be
hard and brisk. lam used to horses and can ride hard.
Wages are of no object. I would accept very small wages
(small boy’s wages) if I could only have plenty of horse-
riding. In fact I would gladly work the first few months
for no pay if wages are hard to obtain. I would sign an
■mgagement for six, twelve, or eighteen months, or even
two years, provided there is a lot of horse-riding. lam
IT years of age, strong and stout, and have references of
i very high character. For six years I was clerk to a
1 irge wine and spirit house in Sydney. Would you kindly
hlige (if you cannot give me a billet) by making inquiries
'ff the different stations, and let me know result as soon
is possible.—Yours very truly, Thomas . P.S.— Do
not forget that I am willing to go to any part of the
Northern Territory of any of the colonies—that I don’t
care how far north it is—that I don’t care what sorter
how hard the work is, so long as I can have brisk horse-
riding.
The Bulletin is anxious to find a billet for this
young man, therefore any northern squatter who
wants to engage an energetic assistant, and who
can promise him a fair screw and a very large
quantity of brisk horse-riding will please com-
municate with this office. Only persons with a
lot of horse-riding to do need apply.

ITHOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Bassnmssen's
PUBELY HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALFALINE
FILLS,” which f hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

Herr Rassmussen —I am pleased to inform you that your
Alfaline Remedies acted most wonderful in my case. I consider
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely sub-
stantiated , both in my case and in several of my family and acquaint-
ances, to whom I have recommended their use. 1 consider they
are far more efficacious than any remedy yet brought before

Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of ner’
forming many great cures during the last few years as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Hel T Rassmussen has shown us some highly comnli-
mentary .1 estimonials which he has received certifying* to
= fcant cures effected by his remedies.”—Sydney Evening
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected bv his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.”—“Centennial History of N S W ”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.”— Australian Star.
Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
iRUTH. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and eniovs
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S Wales
Victoria, and Queensland,”— Cooktown Courier (Q.),
It may not be out of place to mention that Herr
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years. —Sydney Sunday Times,
A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them Mr
Rarnsden s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies
cured him m six weeks, after many Sydney doctors
gave him up. A gentleman in this district, who has been
a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several » doctors ” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
NSW SUffenng humanity- Kangaroo Valley Pioneer,
A JUST REWARD.
‘Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Reme-
dies everybody has heard, soon became known by
the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of which
h® has tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world—are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.
Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN?
Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. We have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was

Extract from “ Ayame San,” a Japanese
romance, by James Murdoch
Ye see, I’d come down from the front to Suakim, where
there were lots of monimental cornshtalks from Australia.
Although they didn’t do much foightin’ to spake av, they
were men av no mane courage, otherwise they’d never
have vintured their bodies on such outrajisly tinder
shupports as their legs was. They killed wan donkey
they mistuk for a shpy, an’ that was all the damage they
did tu the inimy, an’ the inimy didn’t do even as much
to thira, no doubt being moighty afraid av tacklin’ the
ragin’ typhoon av profanity their kyamp alius was. But
they had their parson all the same, and he preached av
a Sunday. So whin I came down from convertin’ the
haythen wid Dali cartridge an’ the butt av a rifle, I wint
tu hear him, being moindful av a little harmless divarsion.
His tixt was, “ Blessed are the pase-makers for they shall
be called the ohilder av God,’ which shtruck me as
moighty quare doctrine for sodgers. He prached wid an
accent that was first cousin tu a Cockney coster monger
callin’“’Ot pies ! Pies all ’ot!” and some av the Surry
Bigiment that had dhropped in tu pass the toime av day
wipt tears of homesick affection.
Prior to its erection in Melbourne ceme-
tery, Emily Mather Deeming’s tombstone is on
view in a Melbourne monumental mason’s yard.
On the stone are cut these lines (author, Anon.): —
Inscribed on a piece of marble, at the foot of the
tombstone, one reads the following from the pen
of the gifted Mr. Thunderbolt, Inspector of
Nuisances (other than poetry):—
Most of the visitors to Sydney Public
Library are middle-aged men. A week-day
average is 320 men and 40 women, a Sunday’s, 80
men and 15 women. Women, who are omnivorous,
have a separate room, of which some queer visitors
have availed themselves. One lady used to bring
a rug and a cushion and ask for “Moore’s Poems.”
Then she’d arrange her beddingon a sofa and turn in.
After'reading for a little while she would rest the
book on her knees, and under pretence of thinking,
fall asleep. She was a restless sleeper, and what was
worse she used to talk in her sleep. Generally her
slumber would last two hours, and when she
awoke “Moore’s Poems ” would be on the floor.
That didn’t discompose her—Oh, no. She’d just
yell: “ Hey, attendant! Come and pick up my
book!” One hoyden asked for Zola. “Zola!”
gasped the official, “we don’t keep him.” “Not
Zola the astronomer?” “No! ma’am.” A
“ lovely actress ” came daily to study Don Juan.
A sweet little school-girl, as fresh as a
spring morning, called every lunch-hour to
read Mark Twain. Her joyous laugh would
ring through the room ; it was so fresh and
musical that the officials loved it. Of the male
visitors, a dwarf hunchback studied nothing but
the dictionary for 18 months. A monomaniac’s
delusion was that a fortune had been left him,
and that the testator had advertised for him in
some newspaper. So day after day, year in, year
out, he delved through the advertising columns of
all journals, magazines and newspapers. Of course
he had the luck of most fortune-seekers. People
have come to the Library, asked for certain old
Sydney newspapers and records, and cut out and
eaten paragraphs relating to their ancestors. A
few years ago a certain famous London forger
visited the Library every morning. He always
sat in one particular chair—evidently from super-
stition. If his chair was occupied when he arrived,
he’d walk about and fret and fume until it was
vacated. He read the Contemporary, the Fort-
nightly, and the Nineteenth Century. AnM.A.
of Oxford, a habitual drunkard, was a constant
visitor totheLibrary. On one occasion hestaggered
in, pranced up a step-ladder, and, gaining the
summit, toppled over, and fell head-first upon the
floor. One humorous crank would come quietly
pirouetting up to an official and gently sing, “ I’m
the Emperor of Japan, my object all sublime is to
make you my chief librarian.” Then he’d say,
“ I want my book—l forget the author and the
title, but there’s a man and a woman or a child in
it.” He was given a book—any book. The crank
generally read for five minutes; then he placed
the book on the far edge of the table before him,
and stared rigidly at the ceiling. After an hour’s
abstraction he would ask, “ Do you see me gazing
upwards ?” “ Yes !” “ Well, I’m looking straight
into Heaven! ” When shown the rules he
remarked, “Oh, those are for the public; they
don’t affect me. I’m the Emperor of Japan,” &c.
Under promise of secrecy he used to relate how he
became engaged to the Princess Beatrice and
jilted her. Another crank, a self-avowed genius
(Irish) used to come in a dress-suit, at 2 p.m., and
read the Protestant Standard. The Library
(which, by the way, was founded in 1869, after
the purchase of the old Australian Subscription
Library, which had existed since 1819) contains
to-day 66,000 vols., but has room for 200,000.
The ingenuity of the librarian, Mr. R. C. Walker,
in economising space, may be estimated from the
fact that in the British Museum, 56,000 vols.
occupy a space which, with Mr. Walker, will
serve for 76,000 vols.

“August
Flower”
The Hoii. J. W. Fennimore is th 6
Sheriff of Kent Co., Del., and lives
at Dover, the County Seat and Cap-
ital of the State. The sheriff is a
gentleman fifty-nine years of age,
and this is what lie says : “I have
‘ ‘ used your August Flower for sev-
‘ ‘ eral years in my family and for my
own use, and found it does me
‘ ‘ more good than any other remedy,
“ I have been troubled with what I
“ call Sick Headache. A pain comes
‘ ‘ in the back part of my head first,
and then soon a general headache
‘ ‘ until I become sick and vomit.
“At times, too, I have a fullness
“ after eating, a pressure after eating
“at the pit of the stomach, and
‘ * sourness, when food seemed to rise
“ up in my throat and mouth. When
‘ ‘ I feel this coming on if I take a

SPORTING NOTIONS.
W. T. Jones* who is shaved by our London
correspondent’s barber, told that important functionary
that unless one of his horses won the Melbourne Cup he
would sell off his stud. He informed the aforesaid barber
that be has WO horses in training ! So says the barber,
anyhow.
# # *
Guineas Hay, at Caulfield, was damp and
generally unprofitable to punters, but it revealed a “dead
bird ’’ (on paper) for the coming Vic. Derby. Camoola,
with all the worst of the weights, won the Stakes more
easily than The Admiral did two years ago, and if the
“ syndicate’s ’’ horse should be produced in Ids best con-
dition for the Derby he might to finish at the head Of
affairs. Certainly Camoola ran more takingly than
Autonomy, who, for his part, beat the supposed crack
three-year-olds of Victoria. None of the running seemed
to throw much light on the Caulfield Cup, albeit the
chances of Bungebah and Paris were not improved by a
beating, genuine or otherwise. Both of these erratic
Sydney horses carried money, therefore they were pre-
sumably doing their best, or something near it. In which
case they are not likely to start warm favourites on Satur-
day, or to run up to their improved appearance. It is
said that the G’Naroo people were pleased with his “third”
in the Stakes and may slip last year’s winner for another
Caulfield Cup, but the spur-marks and sweat on the horse
after Saturday’s race indicated that lie was “ all out ” for
that event, and may not be quite ready for another three
weeks. Fortunatus and Linburn w ill both go close for
the It-raile race. Linburn, on paper, must go (lie closer
of the two, and with Paddy M'Govvan up and Annesley
not heavily hacked by the Ballaratians, we think Linburn
ought to finish in the first three. Annesley at the best
is a faint-hearted horse, and Scobie, at time of writing,
doesn’t seem as sweet on the chance as he was a fortnight
ago. The W. R. Wilson stable expect handsome Pyg-
malion to win, but Pyggy is another uncertain customer
who runs badly when least expected. Spokesman, all
going well during the week, can’t help having a great
show’—but, there, experience has proved the absurdity of
attempting to point out a logical conclusion to the
bustling Caulfield Cup. If Pigeontoe wins at Mentone in
the meantime The Bulletin will rather expect him to
pull off the big event. Only one horse can do it, anyway,
and Pigeontoe may be that one, if Linburn, or something
else, can’t beat him.
« * «
Should the new N.S.W. Trotting Association
work things properly they may now have the chance of
bringing the sport into respectable channels for the first
time in N.S. Wales. Diplomatically approached, the pro-
prietary clubs might give a trotting race in their pro-
gramme, and run on its merits it would no doubt add to
the success of their meetings. So far, Rosehill, Canter-
bury, and Moorefleld have practically sent the whole
hilin’ of trotting horses and their owners up for life, and
the barefaced swindles have been confined to the Driving
Park and Lillie Bridge. Should the clubs around Sydney
agree to receive the erring ones back into their fold there
should be no half measures. It might not be a bad plan
for the committees, it they think a horse has been im-
properly handled, to reserve to themselves the right of
sending the horse a trial mile with their own rider or
driver up, and if they find the times out of all disparity,
to deal with the offenders in fitting manner. That a
sport so beneficial to the improvement of our carriage
and road horses should fairly stink in the nostrils of even
habitues of pony meetings is a pity indeed.

Jockeys with Irish names appear to have
almost a monopoly of success in Australian cross-country
events. On Guineas Day at Caulfield, they won three
Jumping races out of four.

The original Miller (J. J., of Melbourne, now a
well-known show-printer, who, after an honourable and
successful career as a sweep-promoter, abandoned the
business owing to the operation of the Victorian anti-
sweep law) writes to The Bulletin, absolutely denying
that he or anyone belonging to him is in any way con-
nected with the sweeps promoted by “A. J. Miller,” who
dates from Hunter-street, Sydney. Nor is he, the original
J. J. Miller, in any way connected with the “ J. J. Miller”
whose imprint appears on the circulars of “ A. J. Miller ”
aforesaid.
* # *
Which all goes to bear out the opinion already
expressed in The Bulletin as to what sort of person Mr.
“ A. J. Miller ” is.

Pine £2 and costs .£l, was altogether inade-

Burlington B. in the trot at Sydney Driving Park. A
fortnight previously Silver Cloud was pelted by the crowd.
It is a common thing tor the “ push ” at Lillie Bridge to
throw paper pellets and sand at unpopular horses and
jockeys. In the Burlington B. case, it was sworn, as well
it might be, that the life of a driver was endangered when
a coat was thrown at a horse, attached to a racing sulky,
going at a 2.40 gait.

Mr. “Sam.” Hordern won the double at Rose-
hill on Saturday, the Granville Stakes, with Cannon ; and
the Flying Welter Handicap, with Spyglass. The first-
named must have been most gratifying to Mr. Hordern
from the fact that Cannon is by his stallion, Nordenfeldt.

Brown hands “ tote’’-runner a ticket for a
dividend of £5. Runner tries to bluff him that he’s
“reckoned it up wrongly—should be only £4.” Brown
has not cash to bet, but raises a row and gets lull amount,
with remark: “ Well, I made a mistake. I’ll pay alright
—fair’s fair.” Brown asks what about the other nine
subscribers who have been paid- short, and is told, “Oh,
they’ll get it if they call they both guess the
others have not reckoned up dividend, and are not aware
of the fraud. Brown meets two friends, gives them “ the
office,” they call on runner and swear they backed the
horse, gave up tickets and only received £4 each. Three
men spend same evening pleasantly ih 40s. Worth of

The only really successful preventive
and cure of pimples, blotches, black-
heads, red, rough and oily skin, and
most complexional disfigurations is
that greatest of all Skin Purifiers and
Beautifiers, the celebrated
GUTICURA
SOAP
For irritating and scaly humors of
the scalp, with dry or falling hair; red,
rough hands, chaps, painful finger ends,
with shapeless nails, and simple humors
of the skin and scalp of infancy and
childhood, it is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifler of world-wide celebrity, CUTICURA SOAP is simply incomparable
as a Skim Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for the Nursery. Abso-
lutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces the whitest, clearest skin and
t
softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches,
red and oily skin, and most complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable
medicinal properties from CUTICURA, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended
with the purest of toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a MEDICATED TOILET SOAP
incomparably superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and
surpassing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the prevention
of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the complexion, and for cleansing the
scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer. In a word, it purifies, beautifies, and pre-
serves the skin scalp and hair as no other soap does, and hence its sale is greater than the com-
bined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold throughout the world. Price, 25 cents.
Skins on Fire with itching and Burning Eczemas,
And other itching scaly and blotchy skin and scalp diseases, are relieved by a single application, and speedily, permanently and
economically cured by Cuticura Remedies, the greatest Skin Cures, Blood Purifiers, and Humor Remedies of modern times.

The Substituted Leg.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I called upon Professor Dom to con-
gratulate him upon the result of the Lumberly v.
Dom cause celebre.*
It will be remembered that, in consequence of
the accidental blending—making ‘ pi,’ printers
would call it —of Professor Dorn’s hair-seeds, the
bald-headed Lumberly, who was the first subject
of Dorn’s great hair-raising experiment, became
disfigured with a gorgeous thatch of many colours,
compared to which a rainbow tournament would
have been a sober scene of quiet tints ; hence an
action in which damages were laid at £5OOO.
All the philippics of four Q.C.’s had failed to
win the cause for the man with the leopardized
skull-thatch. A smart Sydney junior had sud-
denly sprung upon the Court the theory that
Lumberly was himself liable for the mottled
catastrophe, since he had been guilty of ‘con-
tributory negligence.’
‘ As how ?’ enquired Chief Justice Darley.
‘By having a bald head,’ said the junior,
solemnly.
There was no getting over the contention that,
if Lumberly had not, by contributory negligence,
become the owner of a bald-head, the rainbow-
crop would never have covered him with streaky
damages. So he was potted.
And I called, as I have said, upon Professor
Dom to congratulate him.
* * *
‘Yes, Dipso., I was victorious there, and the
hair-sowing invention is now a remunerative
patent, but I’m sorely afraid that Law is going to
be my ruin after all.’
‘ How so ?’
‘Didn’t you hear? I’m now threatened with
an action for £lO,OOO damages by an old maid
named Philliana Frogfluff.’
‘ Oh, you sly dog ! You amaze me. To think
that a staid, philosophic, dryasdust scientist like
you should turn giddy and trifle with the
affec ’
‘Not another word!’ roared the Professor.
•It isn’t breach of promise; I only wish it
were, and I’d soon settle the Frogfluff. No, sir ;
it’s a case of the blackest ingratitude. Moreover,
it’s the result of one of my grandest and most
successful experiments in surgical science. I saved
that woman’s life, and ’
‘And then you did not marry her. I see.’
‘ Cease your fooling, Dipso. It’s a tragic story,
and shows the ingratitude of the human heart.’
# # #
* Do you remember,’ said the Professor, ‘ a
frightful coach-accident at the Humpback Gorge,
N.S. \V., in the year ’Bl ? ’
‘ I do.’
‘Well, I was in that capsized coach. So also
was Miss Frogfluff, worse luck ! And so was
Jabez Mussell, a seafaring man, who is slightly
necessary to this narative. I had all my surgical
instruments with me—chloroform, ligatures for
severed blood-vessels, &0., &e., and even an
electric endoscope, for use in a lung operation that
I was going up to Cow Flat to perform. When
the crash came, I was shot clean away unhurt,
and with my instruments all safe, I at once
assisted to attend to the wounded. We found
that Miss Philliana Frogfluff had her left leg
crushed badly; while Jabez Mussell had his
breastbone smashed in, and was dying visibly
before us.
‘ All my professional faculties leaped into
activity, and I became possessed of one over-
mastering idea—namely, that there was a chance
to perform a wonderful experiment that I had for
years longed to essay. I bent over the sailor.’
‘ Do you know you are dying ? ’ I said.
He gasped an affirmative.
‘ Do you know that nothing can save you ?’
‘I do,’gurgled he.
‘ Well, there’s a lady here who must lose her
left leg, and maybe her life, unless I can take your
left leg while you and it are living and fit it on
her. Do you understand ?’
He nodded.
‘A leg or so can make no difference to you,
now ?’
‘ Dash your eyes V he swore, ‘ take the timber
and gimme a drink.’
‘ Do I understand you to agree to give this noor
lady your left leg ?’
‘ Yes, darn yer! Only look smart.’
‘Very well. So soon as I’ve amputated her
limb I’ll come and take off your’s, so as to fit it on
hot, as it were.’
Briefly, Dipso, I performed that operation.
Surgeons have since styled it a wonderful deed.
The Scalpel and Sawbones and the Surgical
Talent have awarded me honours for it, and I
can show you honorary degrees from 68 univer-
sities on account of this feat alone. But, to
resume.
* # #
‘ Hold on a bib. How did you manage the
junction of the sailor’s leg to the girl’s trunk,
Professor V
‘ Very simply. I ligatured the long protruding
ends of all her blood-vessels first, to stop the
bleeding. Then I carved off the sailor’s leg and
ligatured the ends of all his blood-vessels. While
the limb was still alive with, the aid of obedient
and deft assistants, I telescoped the girl’s blood-
vessels into the man’s blood-vessels, and that made
the task comparatively simple. The rest of the
operation was easy, merely an adjustment of flesh
surfaces, some ordinary stitching, and the con-
tinued application of antiseptic dressing. I had
Miss Frogfluff conveyed to my own house, and
tended her carefully for 17 weeks, after which she
was able to get about slowly with the aid of a
stick. In six months, she was as lively as a fox-
terrier. Certainly, her left leg was a bit longer
than her right leg, but how much better wasn’t
that than having only one leg, or being obliged to
rely upon an artificial stump?
And certainly, too, she used to complain that,
whenever she heard a hornpipe played, she
couldn’t keep the left limb still; also, that port-
wine would get down into her left foot, but the
last was a distinct advantage, inasmuch as it
tended to keep her nosetip normally pallid.
Further, the left leg gave her an undulating
motion, which made her quite distinguished and
swan-like in a ball-room.
‘ How do you account for that, Professor ? ’
‘ It was a sea-leg, you know.’
* * «
‘ And do you mean to tell me that this
Philliana Frogfluff is suing you for £lO,OOO
damages, on account of the benefits you have con-
ferred upon her ? ’
‘Not exactly that; you haven’t heard half the
story yet.’
* * #
The Humpback Gorge coach-accident
was in ’Bl, 11 years ago. After that, Miss
Philliana Frogfluff led a life undisturbed by aeci-
dent, until recently.
‘ It’s a wonder she never married ? ’
‘ She was going to be on three separate occasions,
but her left leg invariably bolted with her from the
altar, directly it heard the words —“ Wilt thou
have this man to be thy wedded husband ? ” You
see, it was a male leg and couldn’t be expected to
thrill over a husband.
‘But Miss Frogfluff’s luck broke a few months
ago. She was one of the victims in that frightful
Parana railway-accident, and her longer leg—the
left, of course—got crushed badly. Miss Frog-
fluff promptly sued the N.S.W. Railway Com-
missioners for damages, and was nonsuited. And
that’s where I come in.’
‘ Hew so ?’ .
1 The lady appeared in court on crutches. The
opposing Q.C., with the professional irreverence
of the legal tribe, Ventured to insinuate that,
perhaps, the lady’s leg wasn’t hurt so much as she
thought it was; that, perhaps, the medical evi-
deuce was swayed by a prospect of fat fees ; that,
in short, perhaps it was a got-up case to milk the
Government.
‘ I’ll show the court the poor lady’s leg,’sobbed
the plaintiff’s counsel. ‘I know it is embarrassing,
but my client is courageous enough to submit to
any test rather than have her reputation taken
away by the innuendoes of a flippant, brow-beating
barrister, whom.l am sorry to have to call my
learned brother.’
‘ Miss Frogfluff underwent the ordeal. Her left
leg was viewed by the judge, the counsel and the
jury. It presented knobby irregularitiesf where
bones had been broken and badly set, rugged
gears, and some cuwous dark diagrams.
‘ Hulloa ! what’s this?’ exclaimed the Q.C.,
pointing with his brief to one of the largest
diagrams.
‘ I don’t know,’ sobbed Philliana.
‘That’s a very hairy leg for a young lady to
wear,’ remarked another barrister, reflectively.
‘I don’t think you’re a gentleman,’ snapped
M ‘ Have "yotf "ever been tatooed?’ asked a bald
lawyer, as if fired by a sudden inspiration.
‘ I’m a respectable maiden,’ answered Philliana,
indignantly. ‘ Oh, if I only had a brother to take
my part p
Suddenly, the leading counsel asked for an ad-
journment. He had a most important witness to
c all. ‘You can guess that witness was I ’ (con-
eluded the Professor, mournfully).
# * *
‘ Well,’ I enquired, after a long pause.
‘Well’ (echoed Dom), ‘ I was put in the box,
and the whole story of the Humpback Gorge
coach-accident, and the fitting-on to the lady of
the sailor’s leg, came out. _
Then the bald-headed barrister moved for a
nonsuit. It was clear (he argued) that the plain-
tiff had not a leg to stand on in this case. The
Railway Commissioners were charged with having
damaged her leg, whereas the, evidence was clear
that the injured limb was not her leg at all, but
the leg of a man who was in his grave. The only
person who could legitimately sue the Commis-
sioneae for damages done to the leg now before the
Court had been buried years ago in a Humpback
Gorge grave. If anybody living could now sue, it
was the unfortunate sailor-man’s heir-at-law. And
if such a person existed, he or she ought certainly
not to sue the Railway Commissioners, but ought
rather to issue a writ for damages against the
plaintiff for pirating the dead man’s leg for so
many years, and for exposing that borrowed limb
to danger. If the plaintiff had any right of action
at all, it was against the learned and skilful P ro .
fessor Dom, who had choused a dying man out of
a limb and had fitted the same on to this
audacious female.
‘And the Chief Justice, my dear Dipso/, agreed
and nonsuited Miss Philliana Frogfluff,’ • *
‘ And ?’
‘ And she now sues me for £lO,OOO damages for
illicitly supplying her with a contraband leg, and
for subjecting her to much distress of body and
mind.’
* # *
A long interval of smoky reflection fol-
lowed.
‘Do you intend to contest the suit, Professor?'
I suddenly asked.
‘Right up to the Privy Council, if it costs me
my fortune, or even if I have to marry the sailor-
legged Gorgon in order to get square.’
‘By Jove ! Dom. Now I think of it, an English
Judge not long ago decided that an amputated
limb becomes the property of the surgeon who
cuts it off, and that it cannot be claimed by the
original owner. If an amputated limb, why not a
transplanted limb? Why don’t you serve Phil-
liana Frogfluff with a formal notice to restore to
you your leg—the corpse’s leg, you know ? If s h e
refuses, prosecute her for illegally holding on to
stolen property.’
‘ Give me your hand, Dipso. I’ll go and con-
sult my lawyer at once.’

Forgiveness.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Civilised hands had planted the homestead
there as neatly as if it had been gently lowered
from heaven. It was in perfect harmony. The
white cottage stood on the green patch at the edge
of the lagoon by the river’s mouth. At high tide
the sea broke over the crest of the ridge and
entered the lagoon. The boat lay moored near
the front door. Rearwards from the house
stretched the paddocks. Beyond these was the
run. The whole was a farmer’s home.
He had started after cattle in the early morning
telling his wife that he would not return till late
in the afternoon. What prompted him to turn
back in an hour’s time Ido not know. He was in
a dreamy mood. For half an hour he had stood
irresolutely beneath a mighty pine. A withered
branch above his head pointed in the direction of
the cottage. It was the emblem of Fate frigidly
registering the man’s destiny.
He came slowly along the path and entered the
house on tip-toe. He was no spy, and why he
now walked noiselessly as the cat was simply the
result of his unintentional return. He entered
the kitchen and heard laughing in the bedroom.
A race was going on in his blood as ho peered
through the crack. His wife was unfaithful, and
the partner of her sin was—a man who had been
generously received at the station the day pre-
viously.
He hesitated—then he suddenly developed a
wonderful activity. He took a pencil and wrote
the result of his discovery upon a slip of paper,
and placed it in the mirror-frame where his wife
would see it. He concluded by stating that when
he had forgiven her, lie would return.
Mounting his horse, he galloped south along the
beach. Twenty miles he went, and reached a
small stream. The surf had stretched a bar of
sand across its mouth at high tide. It had just
broken out afresh. He plunged in abstractedly.
Horse and rider were swept into the sea.
* * *
The young wife read the note. She cursed
herself in despair, and wondered when and how
he would forgive her. Would he keep his promise
and return ? She was beside herself.
# # #
Next morning she stood upon the veran-
dah. She had not slept. Suddenly she saw an
object stranded on the crest between the lagoon
and the sea. Filled with a vague terror, she got
into the boat and paddled across. There was the
body of her husband ! She was forgiven in his
death-struggle, and Fate had put into execution
his last wish. With his eyes picked out, he had
some back home. Will had been stronger than
Death. She was forgiven.

ooal-mine, he was imprisoned by a creep, along
with a traction donkey. For -a long time they
fraternally consoled one another, but, at length,
the awful moment arrived when one must die, in
order that the other might live. Some days later
the rescue party broke through, but who was the
real survivor nobody knows, not even the member
himself.
Apropos the N.S. Wales training-ship
Sohraon. She carries 500 tons of concrete ballast.
Name the officer in high position who is respon-
sible for this stupid expenditure of State money ?
Suppose the hull of the Sohraon is damaged well
below the water-line —an accident not unlikely to
occur —must this'huge block of concrete ballast be
excavated in order to repair the damage? Yes,
The Sohraon business, from start to finish, has
oeen one big, evil-smelling blunder.
A reference in The Bulletin to a recently-
deceased S. A. German scientist reminds a corres-
pondent that a certain titled Melbourne man was
once engaged to the defunct Adelaide man’s sister.
The Baron occasionally in his softer moments men-
tions the fact somewhat in this way: “ Veil, I vas
encaitched myself once to Dogtor ’s sister. She
vas dirty (30) and I vas dirty-too (32). But ve did
not marry She vas a hantsome voman, but I
aftervarts found oud that she kept up her peauty
by sea-pathing mid other artificial means.” At
this point the Baron gets sorrowfully and senti-
mentally solemn, while his audience as one man
tries to stifle its laughter by consuming its hand-
kerchief.
When the Pope was Archbishop nf
Perugia, he said to Orispi: “You’ll be Premia,

Dr. Chisholm Ross, of Newcastle, says
A remarkable feature in the N.S.W. statistics for isoi
■a the very large proportion of insane persons of iruS
nationality, which stands at 1367 per 1000 of the Trial”
born population. It is considerably more than double tv
proportion-for England and Scotland, and is more thn
teven times as large as the proportion for Australia wll
ess than 1026 persons of Irish birth were under asvliil?
care at the close of 1891, being more than one-fourth nf
: lie total number of the insane in the colony, whilst tv*
proportion of persons of Irish birth form only one-flfteentv
of the total population of the province. n
