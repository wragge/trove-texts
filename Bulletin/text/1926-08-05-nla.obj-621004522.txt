New Way:
Smear lightly

Is it not strange that for hundreds of
years man has been scrubbing his face
with soaps containing soda, and has never
reasoned that under such treatment the
skin may suffer? Nothing is more ugly
than a face that looks raw. Shaving
soaps are always the same old method
of shaving. They are made with soda.
But now we have discovered SHAVEX,
the natural method, where no brush and
soaps containing soda are needed.
FREE SAMPLE!
One can shave with Shavex in half the
time, and you will get a smoother and
closer shave than you have ever had,
and shaving will become a pleasure. Your
skin will look and feel like satin, and
your face under this treatment will look
twice as young. No after lotions are
required when using Shavex, for it is a
skin food as well.

The Red Page
The Problem of a Personality
The publication of Mr. Page’s “Letters”
and Colonel House’s “Papers” has tended to
centre public interest on these two men, and
to blur the figure of their chief. Yet the
present crisis in international affairs makes
the study of the ex-President of special value,
because in him and in his struggle can be
seen most clearly the strength' and weakness
of the ideas behind the League. Essentially
the League is Woodrow 7 Wilson’s work, and
not the less so because many authors ham-
mered out the ideas which find expression in
the Covenant.
Wilson stood in politics, in American life,
and for four brief years in the whole world
for the unworldly in ivorldliness. It was 1 bis
strength, as his egoism, his coldness and his
“introversion” were his weakness. It is diffi~
cult to think of any other figure in history
wdiose personal character has influenced so
much the impersonal onrush of facts. It is
that which makes the study of Thomas
Woodrow Wilson something more than the
mere curiosity hunt which is frequently dig-
nified with the title of “biography.” The
most recent portrait —Woodrow Wilson, by
William Allen White (Ernest Benn) —show’s
us the real Wilson, “warts and all.” On
his father’s side he was the son and grand-
son of Irish Presbyterians who went to
America in 1808. His mother, Janet Wood-
row 7, w 7 as the daughter and grand-daughter of
Presbyterian college professors and preach-
ers from Glasgow. “The fighting Irish who
w 7 ere his father’s people and the rebellious
Scots who w 7 ere his mother’s people, welded
in him by the nonconforming creed of Calvin
and Knox, made Woodrow Wilson what he
W’as. _lt was foreordained and predestined
by the inexorable canons of spiritual biology
that a child born in this freehold of Calvin
and Knox should serve his God and fight
his Devil according to his own light wlier-
ever the path of mere circumstance might
lead him across the miserable world.” All
his life the color and charm of the Wilsons
alternated w’itlx the dour and logical “cor-
rectitude” of the Woodrows. In the end the
Woodrows alienated half America and his
cause was lost.
The final cause of that alienation illus-
trates very well how Wilson was his own
worst enemy. At the very height of the
war-fever he was asked to make a speech
in support of some of his party candidates.
He could find no time for this. Nor was
he prepared to write a letter in their behalf.
Finally, he sent a message to the press. This
message was capable of being looked upon as
a mere party appeal. The Republicans were
exhibited as the opponents of the war policy.
It was not, of course, intended to be so.
But the President had no time for the
niceties of political expression, What did
he care if the malicious should seek to mis-
interpret him? The result was a Congres-
sional election which turned out to be a
Democratic debacle. Yet the letter was not
shown to his political advisers until it was
too late to be altered. It was thus that he
always worked out his own salvation.
The future President was born and reached
manhood in the Middle-West. His health,
never strong, forbade him the very lessons
which that open-air country might have
taught him. He had neither the sophistica-
tion of learning which he might have obtained
in the eastern cities, nor the breadth of
human contacts which was the real educa-
tion of his homeland. And so finally his
stepping-stones were universities, until he
finished as president of Princeton. English
communities hold no analogue to the presi-
dency of a great American university. In
that office is combined a scope for real admin-
istrative ability, together with a demand for
culture and learning of the highest kind.
Though Woodrow Wilson had been teaching
political science for 17 years, it was not
till lie became president at Princeton that
he discovered his real metier as the practical
exponent of democracy. He found the uni-
versity had become a hotbed of “privilege.”
Thereupon he set to work to “clean it up,”
with not the slightest reckoning of the hos-
tility which that process would engender.
That was always the manner of his working.
One result of this campaign was to make
Wilson’s name known outside university
circles. By 1910 he had become associated
with the effort to lessen the power of Big
Business in education, as Roosevelt had in
politics. This led to his entry into govern-
ing circles, though largely in spite of him-
self. The leaders of the Democratic
“machine” in New Jersey were about as dis-
reputable a lot as American politics could
show, and needed respectability. Hence the
nomination of Woodrow Wilson as Governor,
a convenient camouflage. For once the
“practical men” proved impractical. Twenty
months later Wilson was President-elect of
the Republic, and the machine, bosses were
in retreat. With his arrival at the White
House “Progressivism” became practical
politics. The details belong to American
history, and are of limited interest to the
rest of the world. With his second term
came the war, and finally American inter-
vention. That is world history and common
knowledge, though the actual course which
Wilson pursued seemed to nations grappling
in the struggle unduly detached. It is yet
too early for us to see this period apart from
our own feelings. But later the position
does undoubtedly change. It is still too
early to assess how much of our common
victory was the result of Woodrow Wilson’s
attack on the “moral front,” and how much
the result of Foch and the British Navy.
Rut the former part is too often forgotten.
Then at the end came the tragedy of Paris.
Wilson turned from winning the war, and
stayed long enough to lose the peace. Vari-
ous observers have chronicled the steps by
which that was achieved. But these details
arc, in the last resort, unimportant. The
explanation lies in the whole of the past life
of the President, and in his studious train-
ing in the manse in the Middle-West. The
rest was but the unfolding of the inevitable.
No man in tin* recent history of America
but Wilson could have carried the idealistic
forces of America so far as they went. No
other man would have alienated them as he
alienation have changed the face of world
history. But the most curious irony lies in
the fact that it was the character of the Pre-
sident as moulded in his early life which
conditioned the turn of events. How different
all might have been had he roughed it with
his schoolfellow’s in South Carolina, or
studied law in the give and take of litigation
rather than in the study! We are learning
to-day of the wise practicality of Colonel
House and the broad sympathies of Mr.
Page. Readers of their papers should turn
to Mr. White’s study of the third great
American. In a sphere beyond “the Cap-
tains and the Kings,” the greatest work was
done by a Calvinistic Professor of Juris-
prudence who never saw the inside of a
legislature till he had passed his 54th year,
but who will surely remain in history as a
great preacher to the common people.

Barrie the Dramatist
Drama is not confined to the stage. It is
found also in the novel, the cinema, the
pages of the newspaper and in the everyday
life of the world. Its range is comprehen-
sive, catching up joy and sorrow, the exhil-
aration of life and the pain of it; its laugh-
ter follows swift upon its tears —for
it covers the whole gamut of the emotions.
In this sweep of the harp of emotion lies its
true metier. As it departs from this, its
proper function, and seeks to crystallise the
contents of its message into an intellectual
submission, it loses, the breadth and signi-
ficance of its appeal. Its fittest setting
is the stage, its only adequate expression
being through the media of the human voice
and gesture, the play of facial expression and
all the nuances of the actor's art.
The greatest dramatist is he who in his
own proper person has shared the simple
emotions of his fellow men, and can clarify
and express them most faithfully. In
the little Scotch village to which Barrie
gave the disguise of “Thrums,” he came ten-
derly close to the home-keeping fundamental
emotions. There lay the beginnings of what
in later life expanded into a generous, genial
and sympathetic philosophy. There perhaps
he visioned too the coming of. Peter Pan in
dream-filled nights, for there “Margaret
Ogilvy” nurtured in him the abiding love of
his fellow-men and fostered the tender, wistful
appeal he later made to the hearts of a world
of children. “The family affection, how good
and beautiful it is!” he wrote. “It is the
grand proof of the goodness in human nature,
for it means that the more we see of each
other the more we find that is lovable.” That
indeed is the keynote of all Barrie’s work,
and in his earlier days it influenced him
almost, to the exclusion of a sense of right
proportion—tended indeed to become almost
sloppy; but the flowing years put the needed.
virility into the creatures of his pen. His
women remained women, his men became
men.
Barrie’s first serious attempt at dramatisa-
tion was a burlesque on Ibsen’s “Ghosts,” fol-
lowed by “Walker, London,” the story of a
little hairdresser who spent the money set
aside for a honeymoon on a last adventure
in liberty. It proved a great success, and
brought many thousands of welcome pounds
to the playwright’s purse. “Jane Annie” fol-
lowed. It was a musical comedy written in col-
laboration with Conan Doyle, and fell some-
what flat. “The Professor’s Love Story,”
that quaintly-humorous conception, was more
successful; then in 1897 came the undoubted
triumph, so far as popularity and pence
were concerned, “The Little. Minister.” In
under two years this play netted for Barrie
a sum sufficient to ensure him from any
shafts of poverty for the rest of his days.
But money never was—Scotch though his
ancestry—an incentive to the man whose
vision of life and its worth had come through
“a window in Thrums.” Another, though
more ambitious, attempt to emulate the
problem-drama of Ibsen, had but a cool re-
ception, the playwright being sharply re-
minded that his genius did not lie in' that
direction. With a complete throw-back to
the sphere of the domestic emotions, he pro-
duced “Quality Street,” a thoroughfare which
has become a highway for the countless feet
of those who can understand and sympathise
with the simple, fundamental emotions that
move the “lowbrow” without the affecta-
tion of concealment and penetrate beneath
the cynic armor of the “highbrow.” It was
a touching play that touched daintily, that
was very human and clean, and sweet as a
nut straight from the orchard. Men called
it “slosh’ and blew their noses; women in
silence dabbed their eyes. At all events it
“got there,” and has remained there—to be
loved secretly and scoffed at openly.
But in the same year. 1902, arrived some-
thing very different. Barrie as a playwright
came into the fulness of liis power. There
was a note of underlying meaning, a new
touch of satire, a suggestion of assault on
the social citadel, in “The Admirable Crich-
ton.” “ ‘Quality Street,’ ” wrote a critic, “is
not more than charming; ‘The Admirable
Crichton’ is solid food from beginning to its
original end. .. . There is no solution to
Crichton so long as this civilisation lasts—
that is its tragedy, and its significance was
that here was a moving play, masterly in
its mingling of fantasy and realism, its’ pit-
ting of natural against civilised conditions
....supremely effective at once as a piece
for the theatre and of social criticism.” Origi-
nally the last act savored of social propa-
ganda, but on reflection Barrie conceived the
duty of the dramatist ended in pointing out
the existence of social anomalies and did not
carry with it the work of the propagandist.
So it was altered to its present form.
It was in this same prolific year that “The
Little White Bird” came to London—not
out of Thrums, from which so many delight-
ful humans had made their literary pilgrim-
age. but from the Ever-Ever land whence
sleeping children draw their delicate crea-
tions. Yet again the world saw a new
Barrie—a Barrie who wove mystical fancies
elusive thought-stuff, touching us here ami
there with gossamer wings caught for a

moment in the cobweb of mind, holding all
the content of Fairyland and love and little
children. Peter Pan arrived —Peter the Im-
mortal. He is Barrie’s great gift to the
children of to-day, and their children’s child-
ren for all generations. Peter can never die,
for the world will cease to be the world we
know it when Wendys cease to dream of the
land of Ever-Ever, and the brave days of
Peter Pan are no more.
The following year (1905) saw. “Alice-sit-
by-the-Fire,” and in the intermediate years
tlowed a succession of plays all unique and
all stamped with Barrie’s personality. “What
Every Woman Knows,” “Dear Brutus,
“Mary Rose” and others, not least in its
beauty of conception being that little jewel
with a heart of fire tossed into the years of
war, “The Old Lady Shows Her Medals.”
The world owes to Barrie a gift that may
be shared with Dickens; for in days when
the old fashions, the old thought and the
old home-life were drifting away, he woke
afresh in the hearts of his fellow-men and
-women the simple, earnest emotions of love
and charity and the rapture of beautiful
dreams.

This Worth-while Life of Ours
There can be few things more disappoint-
ing than to be presented with a stone when
one has asked for bread. And the disappoint-
ment is none the less real when the stone
is served upon a plate and a knife provided
for its dissection. Along with Mr. Ellery
and all thinking men, I for one ask for a
philosophy of life. Mary Scott, with the best
of intentions, has offered me a philosophy
of death (R.P. 15/7/’26).
I have been told to “do my bit'’ and get
on with it (whatever my “bit” may be), and
to he content with “the peace of soul which
follows upon work well done”—which means,
if it means anything, that I am to be “con-
tent” with mental and physical fatigue! And I
may rejoice because—for a reason entirely
unexplained—the game is worth the candle.
If I am a thinker, I am naively informed, I
shall need no philosophy of life beyond the
fact that life is a riddle and man a seeker-
after truth. But surely the whole point of
any riddle is that, somewhere, there is an
answer: and what good is served by
informing a professor, busy with a philoso-
phical problem, that his energies would be
better spent in planting cabbages in his
garden?
With comfortable complacence our agnos-
tic friends mourn—or dance—beside the
ashes of our ancient gods, when what they
should really be doing is finding altars for
iheir astonishing crop of new ones. The
generation that bowed before Huxley and
Haeckel lived to offer incense to Mrs. Eddy
and Annie Besant. Huxley had hardly be-
come agnostic before Oliver Lodge—a
scientist far more eminent in his day—be-
came a spiritualist. The people who are
most scornful of mysticism and the super-
natural are the first —like Mary Scott —to
talk mystical nonsense about “the inde-
structibility of contributions to the universal
stock of absolute values.” Science, though
she may have shocked man’s vanity tem-
porarily, by suggesting his humble origin,
lias, so far, failed conclusively to demonstrate
it. While still failing to do so, the same
“science” has proceeded to theorise about
his glorious (biological) Destiny and his
splendid (neurological) Future!
A plea for a philosophy of life is dis-
missed as a renewal of the old child-like cry
of “Lord, show us a sign!” But that cry,
though as old as man himself, seems never
to lose its freshness. And though it may be
the cry of a child, it is also the prayer of a
man. It is, indeed, a cry and a prayer that
will last as long as man. The Jews, 2000
years ago, cried, “Lord, show us a sign!”
To-day some of our most intelligent citi-
zens cry, “Lord, smudge this photograph!”
or, “Lord, move the leg of this table!” And,
so they verily believe, He does! If a uni-
verse with its riddle solved would be “devoid
of interest,” how are we to explain the num-
bers of people' (most of them the best brains
of the race) who, having solved it (as
Haeckel thought he did), or having evolved
a working thesis (as Aquinas undoubtedly
did), remain so extremely interested and
so indubitably interesting?
Admitting, as Mary Scott does, that the
search for truth is the one ideal certain of
permanence, is it not equally certain that
man will continue to use his reason, his in-
tellect and his powers of faith to explain
his place in the universe? And will not
any man who wishes (as all men, at the
same time, do) to be more than a glorified
monkey demand — and evolve —a thesis of
life?
Humanity, they tell us, is like a child who
has discovered that there is no Santa Claus.
But surely the most obvious of all things is
that there is a Santa Claus —a Spirit that
sends not only reindeers over the snow, but
rainbows over the earth. A .Creator who
made —and is making —something out of no-
thing. A God that gave man not only senses
to know Matter, but a brain to know Mind.

play, “Aren’t We All?” produced in Aus-
tralia with great success by the Vanbrugh-
Boucicault company. His next attempt,
“Spring Cleaning.” produced by Pauline
Frederick, promised to be a masterpiece—
promised for two acts, and then fell hope-
lessly short. He worked his play to a really
brilliant climax, but it needed Pinero to
finish it. In “The Last of Mrs. Cheyney,”
now running in Sydney, it is interesting to
note the silence of critics on what is not so
much a clever play as a medley suggested by
several masterpieces of other authors. Not
only is it an echo of “The Importance of Being
Earnest,” “An Ideal Husband” and “The Gay
Lord Quex,” but it has been marred in the
process of transfer. In Mrs. Cheyney
herself we merely have a second Mrs. Chever-
ley (“An Ideal Husband”), who was a
thief, having wormed her way into the high-
est society with her defiant and glib tongue.
In Lord billing we encounter another Lord
Goring (“An Ideal Husband”) and Alger-
non Moncrieff (“The Importance of Being
Earnest”), and a poor mixture it makes.
What Lonsdale has aimed at has been
much less a plot than to use the stage as an
outlet for epigrams. In this regard he tails
lamentably short of the author he endeavors
to copy—Wilde. Where Lord Dilling is the
protagonist, one is constantly reminded ol
determined attempts to catch the atmosphere
of lines like “I love to talk about nothing,
it is the only thing I know anything about ,
“What sort of woman is she? Oh, a genius
in the daytime and a beauty at night ,
“What is unfashionable is what other people
wear, just as vulgarity is the conduct ot
other people”; and so on.. In the case ot
Mrs. Cheyney we are reminded of passages
like “Oh, don’t use big words; they mean
so little” ; “I hate the London season: it is
essentially matrimonial. People are either
hunting for husbands or hiding from them ;
“Only dull people are brilliant in the morn-
ing at breakfast; and then the family skel-
eton is always reading family prayers ; Une
should always play fair when one has the
winning cards” ; and so oh ad infinitum.
Where Lonsdale has pilfered from Pinero
is in the “big scene” between Lord Dilling
and Mrs. Cheyney, and which the critics have
made so much of. It is merely n poverty-
stricken replica of the scene in Ihe Lay
Lord Quex” between Quex and Sophy I nh-
garney. Both lords lock the women in the
room with them, only Pinero does it first;
both women try to escape by raising a hulla-
baloo, and again Pinero gets in first; both
women tug at a bellrope to summon the
household—-Pinero first again. But Mrs.
Cheyney throws a half-glass of whisky m
Dilling’s face, and this constitutes a wonder-
ful “dramatic effect.”
The theme of “Mrs. Cheyney” can be set
down in a few lines. A. clever woman crook
and a couple of convenient accomplices be-
come introduced into London society. A
lord, who admires the crook from Australia,
discovers, after heavy thinking, that her
chief accomplice was at college with him;
he uses this knowledge as his entrance to
intimate relations with the lady. He com-
promises her as Quex did Sophy Fullgarney.
Then Mrs. Cheyney throws the glass ot
whisky in his face. Much greater deeds have
been perpetrated in second-rate melodrama
and gone uncommented upon. Later on Mrs.
Cheyney tears up a cheque for £lO,OOO. It
is said that truth is stranger than fiction.
It is safe to say that in this instance fiction
is the stranger.
MID-CHANNEL.
Why Authors Leave Home
Looking on at this one-sided controversy,
in which the author is the toad beneath the
harrow, I cannot help being struck by the
growing tendency to order the nameless
author about. He is told, in effect, to pro-
duce a smart, mechanical story, such as is
featured chiefly in glossy magazines in the
States or in England. He is asked to pro-
duce something alien, in both style and
matter. Having done this, he will then,
oddly enough, be recognised as a Distin-
guished Australian Author. It is all very
like the tailors’ advertisements “Entirely
distinctive styles. Everyone is wearing
them.” The author is to become distin-
guished by making himself “more samer than
everyone else.”
An Australian story has to be Australian
in style and attack (not merely in place-
names), or it is nothing. As long as 20
years ago Lawson’s stories blazed the trail
of our probable path of ultimate success.
They were stories of the loosely-hung type,
the plot present but masked. They had
an inner delicacy and subtlety of feeling,
often covered by a rough surface. Their
intense human sympathy, pervaded with
humor, held a sombre pity, and this latent
gravity caused some people to class them
as morbid, and caused a few of Lawson’s
more superficial imitators to write some
stories that w’ere merely morbid. Since
Lawson wrote, a series of economic, social
and sometimes literary accidents has caused
editors and those in power to mistrust what
may be called the Lawson tradition. Lawson
himself is accepted as a landmark, but not
as a signpost for others. I can only say
that by all evidences it is clear that if Law-
son as an unknown writer were to send in
his finest stories to Australian editors to-
day, the stories would inevitably be turned
down. The reasons for this have been gradu-
ally given in most of the recent articles on
“Why Authors Leave Home.” The same
would happen, for slightly different reasons,
if the brilliant Maorilander, Katharine Mans-
field, were to send in her atmospheric, vivid
sketches, not made on any machine. What
visible “plot” is there, for instance, in her
tale of a day at the seaside, that long story
“At the Bay”?
Yet if the author is not allowed to write
about what he knows in his. own country for
l.is own countrymen, and in his own way,
he had indeed better “leave home.” For an
Australian writer, it is more interesting and
stimulating to write a genuine story in an
Australian magazine than to write a
mechanical story in an American one. Two
things have made it hard to write the Aus-
tralian story: the ingrained smallness of the
pay, and the limitation as to length, which
means that many a story, needing the length
of “At the Bay,” for instance, has to be
compressed almost into the bald form of a
diagram. Putting up with these two serious
and chronic difficulties, though, the author
is now confronted with a third: he is bidden
to abandon any style he has painfully and
gradually acquired, and to write in a slick,
“magazine” style: his subject-matter also
is more or less dictated to him, for it is to
he “magazine” too. In future,, he might as.
well write such stories, outside of Australia-
at more adequate lbngth and for- several
times the pay.
Those of us who have been glad to be-
lieve that Australia ’’ad the beginnings of
a character that would show through in all
the arts are disheartened to watch these new
developments. We have leapt to agree-
ment with careful statement?! like that of
Professor Gregory (in his' small Cambridge
manual on Australia) when he emphasised
cur definite temperamental difference from
the “romantic” American. Our line of
development, we felt, was to be separate.
We have delighted in Edward Garnett’s vivid
assertion that our Lawson “expressed a con-
tinent.” We have hoped also that the develop-
ment of our film plays would mean the pro
Auction of something positive and character
istie —not merely the exclusion of work
from abroad! Yet there seems to be an
impulse at present to check what genuine
native growth there was. It is like the
revivalist’s fumbling prayer: “A spark has
been kindled in his heart: water it, Lord!
Our authors’ spark has lately received a
plentiful contribution of cold water. Isn t
it time for the use of bellows instead?
NETTIE PALMER.
A Satchel of Books
The Abbot of Kirkstall, by Col. T. Walter Harding
(lleffer). This romance of the time of the Black
Prince will appeal to lovers of history in fictional
guise. It is a conscientious study of the days in
which it is cast and is throughout inspired by a
high purpose. A welcome relief from frenzied fiction.
Essays of To-day and Yesterday (Harrap). A
further instalment of a neat and handy pocket
edition of essays; the material for the last three
to hand are furnished by Allan Monkhouse, David
Grayson and Arnold Bennett. Admirable little books
to stick in the pocket when going a-fishing, supplying
a companionship terminable at will.
Wild Heart, by Isabelle Sandy (Geoffrey Bles).
Readers of this author’s “Andorra,” a charming
picture of life among the peasant folk of the Pyrenees,
will welcome the present novel, which draws its
inspiration from the same source. Told in a vivid
style, it grips the reader. The translation from
the French has been skilfully done by M. Thompson.
The Crime of Jane Dacre, by Sybil Campbell
Lethbridge (Methuen). The story begins with the
wrongful accusation against Jane that she had stolen
£3OO from the woman who had adopted her. Of
course she hadn’t, but you must start a detective
story with something to detect. The characters are
well drawn for a book of its kind, and the interest
is sustained.
Palmvra’s Pirates, by Stanley R. Osborn (Geoffrey
Bles). “To make a South Sea voyage on a pleasure
yacht where two of the company are agreeable young
men, either of whom would make a desirable hus-
band, is in itself distracting. But to this is added
a complex of other disturbing elements including
one Ponape Burke, of “the evil heart,” from whose
unwelcome addresses one of the two desirable young
Americans, assisted by an “heroic brown man,”
rescues Palmyra and resolves her dubiety of choice.
Quite an eventful yachting trip.
Billy Van, by F. R. Buckley (Geoffrey Bles).
More Wild West fiction. Stories of this class are
practically all cast in the same mould, with the
same super-man hero, a blend of the stone-age
ancestor and the knight of chivalry, and the heroine
is either a hefty maiden or a bit of society lace
with a languishing love for the strong man. It
■would be safe to say that there is not an Australian
author of the present day who would not be ashamed
to turn out such a crude product; it is without a
trace of literary value. Yet we import this stuff
wholesale.
An Escaper’s Log, by Duncan Grinnell Milne (John
Lane). Readers who recall “The Road to En-Dor,”
a story of escape in the grisly days of war which
had ail the exciting vigor of a novel, will find in
this volume much similar matter. “It is,” says the
author, “a tale —or rather a series of tales —about
prisoners and escaping,” and “I have attempted to
write nothing but the truth.” Whilst allowing that
’the treatment of prisoners in Germany was un-
doubtedly bad, he makes the frank admission that
“Of one thing I am certain. I would sooner be
a prisoner in Germany than in certain other countries
opposed to her.” The writer, a captain in the
R.A.F., has put together a readable book with
thrills in it.
The Number One Boy, by John Taintor Foote
(Appleton and Co.). “Voice of Buddha, Finger of
Poon Koo Wong, the immortal Chang Foo Low,”
could, with a look of his eye and a wave of his hand,
rob the presumptuous of both speech and movement.
He is the central figure in this story, which moves
in the whirlpool of the Boxer rebellion. To save a
U.S.A. girl from the unwelcome attentions of an
officer in her country’s military contingent, the great
priest and prophet becomes the “number-one boy”
of her persecutor, who incidentally is also her
guardian, and by bis miraculous powers succeeds
in placing her in the arms of her true love. Mar-
vellous, most marvellous, and yet again marvellous.

“Bill O’C.”: Why will not book publishers study
the convenience of librarians and readers in the
color of binding and back lettering of books? Obvi-
ously the two should be in strong contrast, with
the letters bold enough to be read at a little distance.
Our own Cornstalk Company issues Christopher
Morley’s “Thunder on the Left” in a rough dark-
blue cloth with black back-lettering—the title un-
decipherable and the author’s name illegible a foot
away. Another sinner is Shaw, or his publisher,
who sends out the well-known series of plays in a
pale French-giey cover with the titles in minute
gilt lettering, so that, when the books are not on tiie
eye-level shelf, one has to pull out the lot to find
the one wanted.
“Ancient Mariner”: “Ida Lee” (Mrs. Marriott)
attempts to show (R.P. 3/6/’26) that I was off my
course when I impugned certain statements appear-
ing in her book on Australia’s explorers. In
opposition to her dictum that Cook’s Endeavour flew
the white ensign, I averred it was the red, and now
the Admiralty Librarian steams in with the news
that it was the blue. He isn’t positive, however.
He merely “thinks” that, in Cook’s day, the practice
with H.M. ships engaged in surveying and other
detached duties, was to fly the blue ensign when
outside the jurisdiction of an admiral. But Cook
set out under the direct orders of “the rulers of
the King’s navee,” to which potentates he directly
reported on his return. Therefore I say again that,
on her visit to Australian shores, the Endeavour
would have flown what was then the Admiralty
standard —the red ensign. I also disputed Ida Lee’s
statement that “on the night of April 30, by civil
reckoning, Cook lost one of his ship’s company,
Forby Sutherland,” on which point the oracle she
has consulted is cocksure that she is right and
I wrong. Mr. Perrin informs me that events entered
in the afternoon of a given date in any old sea log
really refer to the afternoon of the previous day in
the civil calendar. Quite true, but he forgot to
mention that the locality in which Forby Suther-
land died isn’t in the longitude of the Admiralty
Library. Therefore the civil day doesn’t begin at
precisely the same instant at both places. Cook
approached our shores by way of the Horn, and
having made no allowance for his westing, he was
14 hours behind Greenwich time on his arrival
here, whereas if he had come by the eastern route
he would have gained 10 hours. Thus when he
made his landfall, his ship time would be 24 hours
behind civil time as we now reckon it locally.
Taking that into account and not forgetting that
the nautical day began 12 hours ahead of the civil
day, I still maintain that, for those who cannot
refrain from making pedantic alterations in Cook's
logs, the rule for the conversion of his ship time
into Australian civil reckoning is to add 24 hours
to his a.m. ■ entries, and leave those relating to his
p.m. as they stand. That seems to be the rule
Professor Arnold Wood has adopted in his “Dis-
covery of Australia” (page 413) when dealing with
Cook’s dates, so far as these relate to his passage
along our seaboard. The method of correction
favored by Ida Lee is entirely different. In order
to avoid confusion, nautical experts of the type of
the late Admiral Wharton deem it wise to make
no alteration whatsoever in the days and hours as
they are set down by the navigator himself, so
there seems to be no good reason for either Professor
Arnold Wood or Ida Lee to do otherwise.

Chrysler Six Roadster
Chrysler Six Owners
Get More for Their Money
The trend throughout the Em-
pire today is toward the Chry-
sler Six because the Chrysler
Six is in line with the Empire’s
trend toward genuine economy.
It satisfies the growing desire
to make the pound go farther
—to make it buy more comfort
and enjoyment.
The plain fact is that the Chry-
sler Six affords all the roadabil-
ity, speed, and riding ease of
bigger, heavier cars, and to
these adds its own inherent
advantages.
It is far less costly to buy and
to keep. It gives twice the gaso-
line and oil mileage of many
cars which it equals and
surpasses in speed.
But Chrysler superiority goes
further than phenomenal per*
formance.
It goes deep into materials and
manufacturing. No car is built
of finer materials; no car is
built to finer standards.
The result is that Chrysler Six
stands up in a way that arouses
the highest praise of men and
women who are used to the
very costliest cars.
Any of the distributors listed
below will be delighted to put
the Chrysler Six through its
paces for you*

A PACKARD SINGLE-SIX S,EVEN-PASSENGER TOURING CAR IS ILLUSTRATED
The Packard Mile Costs Less
THE average Packard owner drives his car nearly three
times as far as the owners of other makes because of the
long life of the Packard. Thus the depreciation cost pet
mile is actually more on such cars than on the Packard and
operating and maintenance charges are never any less,
If it costs less to own a Packard by the mile and no more to
run it, why should anyone be without its beauty, its comfort
and its distinction ?
The Packard Single-Six Seven-Passenger Touring Car, illus
trated above, is sold at a price which is much lower than
» most men think, and for the man who desires to own a cat
of distinction and fine performance at a moderate outlay,
there can be nothing better than the Packard.

The Call.
They’re calling “99” to-night,
A coastal steamer’s sign.
The middle watch at Gabo Light
Last saw her port-liglits shine.
Beneath the starry heavens bright
They’re calling “double nine.”
The wireless signals sing and whine
Past port and ship and bar;
Beyond the furthest lights that shine,
Past morning wind and star.
“Oh, Ninety-nine! Oh, Ninety-nine,
Old man, say where you are!”
There’s no response from Ninety-nine,
Though loud the signals call.
In waters deep, which never see
Clear lights nor shadows fall,
Stark fingers lie beside the key
Nor make response at all.
They’re calling “99” to-night,
A coastal steamer’s sign.
Between Green Cape and Gabo Light,
The seas, with tops ashine,
Smooth over with their fingers bright
The grave of Ninety-nine.

Where the orange petals of marigolds at the
feet of the idol- shone.
Drowsy and warm, it somehow adds a fire
to a heated mood ;
So I beg you to put the stopper back, for the
blood-taste is not good.
To-day I go faring for clover blooms, nutty
and sweet and clean.
- The breath of a green September wind is
blowm over Tambourine,
Where the “flooded” gums point to the sky
and the ripple of Millwheel falls
Is heard through the creak of the “monkey
ropes” when the jaunty whipbird calls.
I would ask for the humblest of your store —-
brown reeds that the sun lias kist,
The • earthy odor of polished fern in the
valleys of amethyst,
The musky smell of the rain-wet bark, the
wholesome breath of the trees —-
Have you ever distilled from a cup of moss?
Do you bottle the morning breeze
Or the faint perfume of the coastal box?
Sixpennyworth, if you please!
Strange these should keep their freshness
still that long on the shelf have stood.
Oh, your guinea “essence of Orient” I will
leave —for a different mood!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Dance Goes On.
“Your car is waiting!” Through the noisy
swirl
Of laugh and chatter, rustling silks and
feet
Pattering their echo to tie music’s beat,
Of lighted faces —matron, roan and girl—
The lackey, solemn-faced, his message brings ;
And someone leaves the frolic and is gone.
Some friend a farewell message to ham
flings;
Into the place he filled the revel swings.
The dance goes on.
The dance goes on. Lamps shine and eyes
are, bright
Whore' love and laughter to soft music trip.
If here ■is clouded brow on quivering lip
’Tis masked beneath the general delight.
The red wine gleams like rabies in its flow 1 ;
And those who, wearied, wish the revel
done
Still linger on, or in their going throw
Reluctant glances backward, where aglow
The dance goes on.
The spectral lackeys stand about each door,
Unsmiling in their livery of black.
Anon, one moves soft-footed o’er the floor
Breasting the stream of mirth ; and one
goes back.
So soon to me may come from that dark
file
The messenger to say the feast is done ;
And I shall hear, while still the feasters
smile,
And swiftly leave to find Death’s coach, the
while
The dance goes on!
N.S.W.

A MATTER OF JOY RIDING.
“We know that differences should be settled between the Governor and his Ministers, bnt what we want to know is what is to be done when a Governor and his Min-
isters cannot agree. If the Governor is paramount, then we live under a system of veiled absolute monarchy. That is the important question which awaits decision.”—
Lang on the Upper House appointments question.
CHAUFFEUR LANG: “This is scandalous! You have no right to hold me up like this! I’m legally in charge of the boss’s car."

A SEAT AND THE PRICE THEREOF.
At the N. S. Wales general election 14
months ago a Sydney Domain spouter named
A. D. Kay came out as an Independent can-
didate for North Shore, one of the five-mem-
ber electorates. Having contested a hope-
less Federal seat as a supporter of W. M.
Hughes, and conducted a useful anti-social-
ist campaign, paid for by individual Nation-
alists, in an unpromising quarter, the man
was regarded as a Nationalist with a just
grievance against the party bosses who had
refused to put their brand upon him. His can-
didature was helped by that of Scott Fell,
who was also up against the machine; and
it hurt neither to be deprived of oificial en-
dorsement, for North Shore has small respect
for the coteries that hand out party nomi-
nations. Though the electorate is saturated
with Nationalist sentiment, the National
Federation is weak. Of 52,604 first-prefer-
ence votes, Scott Feel got 6965, Kay 5126,
the Nationalist ticket 23,911, the Labor
ticket 13,111 and four nondescripts 3491.
Kay received most of his votes in Manly and
its environs (1167), Mosman (1649) and
Cremorne-Neutral Bay (649), which are
about the solidest Nationalist subdivisions in
the State. Arthur (Nat.) was elected on
the first count, Murphy (Lab.) on the
eighth and Scott Fell on the twelfth, at
which stage Reid (Nat.) had 8718 votes,
Marks (Nat.) 6430, Ivay 6233 and Tonge
(Lab.) 4773. It was then found that 4009 of
Tonge’s supporters had not carried their
preferences beyond the Labor ticket; of the
764 unexhausted votes, 116 went to Reid
(putting him in with a surplus of 66), 110
to Marks and 538 to Kay, who had already
gained 377 from Arthur and two excluded
Nationalists. As the distribution of Reid’s
surplus and that of Scott (78) would
have made no difference, Kay was declared
elected with 6771 votes —231 more than
Marks’s number, but 1997 less than the quota
of one-sixth of the first-preference total
plus 1.
* * * *
Proportionalism played other tricks at
that election. Thanks to the “mathemati-
cally perfect” fraud, 410,000 Labor votes re-
turned 46 Assemblymen, while 429,000 Nat.-
Cocky votes returned 42. When the new
Parliament met there was a Labor Gov-
ernment with a majority of two, including
the Speaker, whereas if the fool system had
worked according to specifications _ there
would have been a Labor Opposition with, at
most, 43 members out of 90. And the
Nationalists who put Kay in, believing that,
in his way, he was as good a Nationalist as
Scott Fell, soon found that they had been
taken in by a twister. Kay, thinking, as
others did, that “Labor was coming back
everywhere” and that he couldn’t twist too
soon, voted with the Government on a no-
confidence amendment to the Address-in-
Reply. He went on to support a string of
Labor measures, including the £275 p.a. salary
grab that was dated back three months. Re-
minded of having pledged himself on the
hustings to oppose any salary steal, he
brazenly declared that the Nationalists had
altered the position by cutting off supplies
for his anti-socialist propaganda in the
Domain. The gentleman gaily continued on
the Labor track until the result of the
Federal election gave him a rude shock. With
his heart in his boots he learned, not only
that his new allies had been horribly licked
in every State, but that his former friends
had polled 5 to 1 on the North Shore.
From that time the Government felt that
it could no longer rely on his vote. And his
vote became increasingly important as the
caucus grew less and less like a happy band
of brothers. There were mutterings of dis-
satisfaction after the ridiculous fiasco of
the attempt to abolish the Leg. Council,
which attempt was rendered abortive by a
revolt of Labor Councillors who had warm
friends among the Labor Assemblymen. The
Badly" Workers’ Compensation Act vastly
increased the danger of a party split. That
fatuous piece of legislation was an omen of
ruin not only to country industries but to
country Labor members with shaky seats.
If only one of those Labor members crossed
the floor and Kay twisted again the Gov-
ernment would go down and never come back.
* * * *
It was plainly time for the Government
to get busy, and it got busy in its own
devious way. Kay was given a five-years’
appointment as “consumers’ representative”
on the Metropolitan Meat Board at £l5OO
p.a. As “consumers’ representative” he suc-
ceeds a gentleman who, having been
a shopwalker and then a Labor politician,
was reckoned to have qualified for being now
named “producers’ representative” without
reference to the producers. Kay’s only quali-
fication, apart from his having eaten meat,
was that he had a seat which could be
bought if the price was right. And, with
the Treasury at its disposal, the crowd _in
office paid liberally for the goods, beckoning
at the same time to the eager Tonge. That
reject of North Shore, when excluded from
the count, had 1657 fewer votes than the
Nationalist Marks. If a by-election were
held, Tonge wouldn’t have a ghost of a
chance of beating Marks. To promote
Tonge to the vacancy means giving two-
fifths of the representation to a section with
less than one-fourtli of the votes. But it is
confidently believed that the swindle has been
legalised in advance by the following pro-
visions of the Casual Vacancies Act, Kay
having voted Labor on a no-confidence
motion: —
Any vacancy shall be filled by the election of the
unsuccessful candidate... .who (a) represents the
same party interest as the late member, and (b)
upon the count of the primary preferences was the
highest on the list of unsuccessful candidates repre-
senting such party interest.
The party interest shall be determined... .by the
Clerk of the Assembly who shall have regard to
the vote or votes (if any) of the late member on
any motion or motions of censure during the present
Parliament.
The Casual Vacancies Act was passed by
the Storey Labor Government in 1920, and
the Fuller Government was too lazy or
stupid to repeal or amend it. It is by no
means certain that it is good law now or
that its provisions, even if declared valid,
would be held to warrant the scandalous
substitution of Tonge for Kay; and the
matter should assuredly be tested. Mean-
while the business of buying a seat with a
billet for a person whose unfitness is gross
and palpable, and of defrauding the con-
stituency and the rightful claimant, passes
in Tammany circles for being clever. Clever
it may seem to corrupt aldermen and ballot-
fakers ; but unless the general body of electors
have got down to the Tammany or garbage
level, those responsible will get their due
reward.
SOLDIERS’ FARMS, DEBTS, ETC.
Deak Bulletin, —A step, or something that
sounded like a step, was lately made in deal-
ing with the soldier-settlement confusion.
Treasurer Page announced that he only
waited the adhesion of N.S.W. to a certain
agreement, and he would proceed, with the
consent of Parliament, to write off about
141 per cent, (or £5,000,000 in all) of the
States’ debt to the Commonwealth under this
head The Ma State’s share of the offered
"•ift was £1,340,000, and apparently the Ma
Ministry had a fear that it might be loaded,
so it was doing a long preliminary sniff. The
Commonwealth, of course, doesn’t know how
much of the £35,000,000 which it borrowed
and lent to the States on the settlement
racket is lost, and the States don’t know
either —won’t know for a long time. Pro-
bably the States will get the ultimate loss
written off, and won’t repay what isn’t loss,
for they never repay anything. And the
Commonwealth won’t, in the heat of the
writing-off process, refund to the original
lenders the sum which has vanished and is
no longer represented by assets; nor is. it
likely to refund at any time the sum which
hasn’t vanished and is still ostensibly repre-
sented by assets, for it hasn’t the repayment
habit to any great extent either.
* * * *
When the mixed business began, the
Federal authority took the lazy and shiftless
course of finding the loan money, and pass-
ing it on to State rulers to muddle with as
they pleased. It avoided hard work and
direct responsibility by leaving its vast
Federal province, the Northern Territory,
where it had some 334,000,000 acres of its
own, wholly out of the distribution. If it
had concentrated there, a fine collection of
millions which went in land jobbery might
have been available for other purposes. (The
Federal figures to June, 1924, give the
amount spent out of loans on buying
back land for soldiers as 284 millions, and
State figures give the loan amount expended
on buying back land for them and for all
sorts of people as 744 millions.) The State
rulers had varying ideas of the right area
to describe as a soldier’s farm, their views
being partly, but not wholly, regulated by the
space available. A table furnished in the
“Official Year Book” gives figures as they
stood at June, 1924, and though the discrep-
ancies are remarkable I suppose the figures
don’t lie very much :
Average Size op Soldier’s Farm in Acres.
Tasmania . . . . 140 I N. S. Wales .. 1201
Victoria . . .. 265 I Westralia .. 8306
Queensland . . 353 I Commonwealth . . 996
S. Australia . . 858 I
The liberality of N.S.W. is partly explained
by the fact that nearly half the area allotted
was in the Western Division, where the
State owns practically all the land, both that
underfoot and that flying overhead, and
where, apart from Broken Hill, soil has
hardly begun to have a value. It is, in fact,
a place like the N. Territory, but without
many of the Territory’s advantages and
minus its future. The 23,367 soldier settlers
listed at June, 1924, were not the whole
original lot, but only those who remained.
The number is not very large, but if they had
been provided with free farms and a railway
(the £5,000,000 which is now being written
off might have paid for the railway), 10,000
or 15,000 out of the crowd, with their fami-
lies and the inevitable camp-following of
traders, artisans and sundries, could easily
have made a streak of civilisation and socia-
bility across the N. Territory. They would
have elevated it, in the matter of popula-
tion, to, or beyond, the position which
Queensland occupied when it became a self-
governing State. But 10,575 of the military
farmers were planted in the two States (Vic-
toria and Tasmania) where population was
thickest and where they had to be deposited
almost exclusively on repurchased land, and
20,272 were placed in the four southern
States (Victoria, Tasmania, S. Australia and
N.S.W.) which were already most densely
settled. In the first three cases 77 per cent,
of the settlement was on space bought back
in a boom market, the settlers being little
more than pawns in a game of land-dealing
and loan-grabbing.
* * * *
There were miscellaneous concessions to
give the settlers a start, including £625 per
farmer for seed, implements, improvements,
etc. By June, 1924, seven years after the
great scheme was born, the Commonwealth
had advanced £35,063,695, and had appa-
rently got back £307,456, or at least the
amount outstanding diminished by that sum,
through repayment or some other cause. That
represented a trifle over 2d. in the £ for the
period. A comparison of the outstanding
balances suggests that the sum collected dur-
ing the last year of the seven, towards pay-
ment of the above-mentioned £35,000,000-odd,
was £B2lO. This looks like a slowing down
almost to the point of stoppage, and it may
mean that the advances have been to a
great extent used up, and the implements
sold, and the seed eaten by ebooks, and the
original soldier vanished and become a mere
paper asset, and everything gone but the
fence. A rigid valuation of the securities
which remain against the outstanding debts
should lead to astounding revelations.
But what use are revelations? No
Government could make any wholesale fore-
closures on the depreciated assets of the poor
even if they were realisable. In addition to
everything else there is a tangle of State aids
which are hard to sort out, and which pro-
bably constitute second mortgages. Rodgers,
of Victoria, an agricultural member from
the State which took the disease in its worst
form, said that many of the pew farmers
worked seven days per week for half the
basic wage or less, and nobody appeared to
doubt him much. Consequently the way of
the debt-collector is hard. Agriculture is a
science, which some people possess, and it is
a natural gift, which, I suppose, not very
many possess. Young soldiers took to farm-
ing merely because it was offered, though
many might have taken to factory work for
preference if the Commonwealth had killed
off the aggregate importer and created a lot
more factories. Too many got on to micro-
scopic allotments just when the improve-
ment of agricultural apparatus was making
the small hand-labor settler out of date. The
best chance for the small or kitchen-garden
settler is to be close up to a town, but only
one real town is allowed in each mainland
State, and certainly no political blighter
attempts to create another —the artificial
village-metropolis of Canberra excepted. One
thing only was gained by putting returned
soldiers “on the land” instead of providing
for them in essential and self-supporting
“secondary” industries. “The land” busi-
ness is a slow process, and it was seven years
before the magnificent dimensions of Ihe
fraud and failure became apparent. For
either a fool or a knave or a combination of
both it is a blessed relief to postpone being
found out for seven years.—Yours, etc.,
Henry Horsecolear.
THE HIGH COST OF IMMIGRATION.
In The Bulletin of June 3 a case
was cited of an immigrant who had been
passed by a British doctor as a fit citizen,
and who died shortly after arrival here an
almost complete collection of pathological
exhibits. A few weeks back, at Albury, an
immigrant, aged 19, was sentenced on four
charges of stealing, etc. He had been dealt
with previously on similar charges. It was
stated that he had been sent here because lie
was an uncontrollable child. In W.A. the
secretary of the R.S.L. drew attention to an
immigrant who had been in the Perth Men-
tal Hospital on several occasions, had had
help from the League four times, was phy-
sically decrepit, and was then applying to
the Repat. for assistance. It was found that
this man had had his fare paid to Australia
by the Enfield Infirmary in London. The
secretary said he knew of other cases of men
who had been sent to Australia from
infirmaries. The Bulletin (9/4/’25)
pointed out that a circular, dated July
28, 1923, had been issued jointly by
the British and Australian Governments,
offering to pay half the fare to Aus-
tralia of inmates of poorhouses if
the Poor Law Guardians would pay the other
half. And an institution called Embankment
House makes periodical appeals in the Morn-
ing Post for passage money, clothing, etc.,
for the purpose of sending to “the colonies”
derelicts gathered up from the Embankment.
In February, 1925, Judge Bevan sentenced
two immigrants to five years’ servitude. He
commented on the danger of permitting the
importation of such men as citizens. Then
there was Puddifoot, another young immi-
grant, who committed an atrocious crime in
1923. Puddifoot had been under care in
England for mental defect.
These are a few of the cases that come
directly under public notice. But there are
no records showing the full amount of damage
done to our national life through indifferent
selection and haphazard examination of im-
migrants. The writer personally has been
able to collect a few statistics.
The total proportion of non-Australians
in N. S. Wales is about 15 p.c. Yet one
finds that in three years’ admissions to men-
tal hospitals the proportion of non-Austra-
lians is 30 p.c.; the proportion of non-Aus-
tralians in State charitable institutions is
66 p.c. Of course some of these have been
in Australia almost all their lives; on the
other hand, some are admitted the day after
arrival in Australia. In 299 nnsclected cases
at one of the v.d. clinics in Sydney just oyer
20 p.c. were non-Australians. Admitting
that a certain number of these became in-
fected here, 15 p.c. of the population should
not furnish such figures, and examinations
for mental defect and v.d. —neither attempted
by British doctors examining migrants—
should be insisted upon. Especially as
among the records at the v.d. clinic one finds
particulars of single women sent here as
“domestic servants” and admitted to hospital
on arrival in Sydney. One cannot help
wondering whether —ns “domestic servants”
—they now may be tending the children of
an unsuspecting mother.
A medical seiwice staffed by Australians
should be established, with headquarters in
London, for the examination of migrants or
other persons assisted to Australia. Officers
could travel from one recruiting depot to
another as required. Each group should in-
clude a psychologist, and one or more women
doctors to examine the women. An exami-
nation for pregnancy should be made on all
women applicants —not merely on married
women, as at present. (Pregnancy need not
necessarily debar the applicant, but the fact
should be noted, if only for the information
of the ship’s M. 0.) The medical certificate
should be revised and be made to show defi-
nitely that a blood examination for syphilis
and a bacteriological examination for
gonorrhoea has been made in every case, and
it should include a statement as to the appli-
cant’s mental age and intelligence quotient,
as well as full particulars as to physical
condition. Laboratories staffed by Austra-
lians should be set up in the largest recruit-
ing centres, to which blood, sputum and other
pathological specimens could be sent for
examination. At present no such facilities
exist, and to obtain a laboratory report on
a single specimen would cost the doctor at
least twice the amount he receives as an
examination fee —10s. 6d. An Australian
Medical Service M.O. —half of whose salary
should be paid by the shipping company—
should be carried on each boat bringing
migrants to Australia. Arrangements should
be made whereby examinations for v.d., and
treatment if necessary, could be carried out
on board ship. Many migrants “celebrate
their departure from home after the medical
examination ; they should be informed that
any person suffering from v.d. who attempts
to land in Australia is liable to deportation.
Meantime, Australia House should be in-
structed that any doctor responsible for pass-
ing as fit such persons as Puddifoot would
have his name removed from the medical
roster. Provision against impersonation
exists, and the doctor examining migrants
should be held responsible should it occur.
Appointments to the service could be made
for a period of one or two years, and a
salary sufficiently good to attract efficient
officers should be paid. This would prevent
the service being regarded as a “dead-end
job,” and, with the opportunities for travel
afforded, should ensure a constant supply.
In cases where it was preferred a smaller
salary might be paid, and three or six
months’ “study leave” given on full pay to
any doctor who wished to do any special
laboratory or hospital work in Europe or
America. Reports to the Commonwealth
Health Department as to the study done and
the knowledge gained should be required ot
all who take “study leave.”
It has been objected, that if a medi-
cal examination of migrants from Bri-
tain were made sufficiently thorough . to
exclude undesirables, a larger proportion
of Southern Europeans of a lower
type than the Britons would have to be
admitted as a consequence. But if the exami-
nation of Southern Europeans were equally
rigorous this danger would not exist. VY ini
regard to the examination of migrants in
the country of origin, the bogey of “a fear ot
international complications” has been raised.
But an objection to Australia insisting on a
certain standard in those admitted here as
citizens and the potential parents of future
Australians surely could be. taken as prtma
facie evidence of an intention to dump un-
desirables into our country. .
The contention that immigration will
dwindle if these restrictions are enforced may
be answered in two ways. (1) It it ae *


choice between a small number of sound citi-
zens and a large number of unsound ones,
the former is economically the better pro-
position. It is useless to import people to
be a burden on the taxpayer. (2) Despite
restriction and difficulty of entry, the pros-
perity and high wages consequent on a high
Protective tariff in the U.S.A. have resulted
in a steady increase of immigration; over
50 p.c. of the number leaving Britain yearly
go to the U.S.A. And it is a picked 50 p.c.
at that. Neither difficulty nor a medi-
cal examination will deter the type of citi-
zen Australia needs —provided we offer him
sufficient inducement to come. And main-
taining a high standard of citizenship is no
disloyalty to Britain, for the future of the
Empire lies not in little England, but in
her overseas dominions. And perhaps be-
cause of our position in the Pacific and our
comparative freedom, so far, from the dis-
eases of degeneracy, and from the racial pro-
blems that hamper both Canada and S.
Africa, it lies chiefly in Australia and Maori-
land.
NUX VOMICA.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Unionist and His Sub.
Trades-union circles in the Cold Country
were shocked to the marrow the other day
when certain ships’ stewards went into a court
presided over by Tomlin, J., and asked for
an injunction restraining E. Siiinwell and
others from collaring the funds of their
union. It appeared that, with others,
Siiinwell, the enterprising little old-clothes
dealer who looked after the London end of
Tom Walsh’s attempt to make British sea-
men rat on their union, had taken over
their organisation when no one was looking.
Siiinwell and his friends had also taken
over £75,000 of union funds. It was sliowm
that faked ballots and false declarations
played a part in the coup, and the injunc-
tion was granted. It was also proved that
-Shinwell’s union, the Marine Workers,
distributed in benefits about £3500 in the
year in which the spurious amalgamation
took place, and had spent £38,500 on “ad-
ministration” in the process. Unions of
seafaring folk, of course, are particularly
easy to control, owing to the fact that at any
given time a majority of the members are
practically certain to be at sea; but it is
open to question whether trades unionists, as
a whole, either in Britain or in Australia,
get honest value for the money they spend
in union dues. The matter could only be set at
rest by very much more stringent auditing
conditions than at present prevail. As any-
one who has run a political party, a union
or a croquet club knows, there are long
periods in' the history of such concerns when
members absolutely refuse to trouble them-
selves about problems of management, and
in those blind periods anything might hap-
pen to the funds if the executive officers
- —who may be three or two or one in number
for all practical purposes—wanted things to
happen. Usually the rules are designed to
prevent mismanagement, but rules are
administered by the management, and, not
infrequently, made by the management. The
average trades 1 unionist, too, is so accus-
tomed to regarding his union as his master
that it seldom, enters into his head to
inquire what he is getting for his money.
But there is quite a lot of money at stake.
Th« latest returns show that there are
730,000 trades unionists in Australia, and
in the Ma State, where nearly a quarter of
a million of them are clustered, they pro-
vide their organisations with income at the
rate of 50s. a head per annum. Applying
that average to the Commonwealth, the
unions are probably receiving each year
about £1,800,000. What they do with it
is not as clear as it might be. In N. S.
Wales during the year ended June 30, 1924,
the “benefits” paid out amounted to under
15s. a head, leaving about 335. a head for
administration and other purposes—some-
thing under 2s. a head was carried forward.
In Maoriland, if the members of a union
have any doubts about the union accounts,
they have only to mention the matter to the
Labor Department and an auditor is sent
along with full powers to investigate, and
if necessary, to prosecute. In Australia, un-
less there is recourse to the ordinary courts,
the wage-plug hasn’t got much of a chance
of interfering with the way his union funds
are spent, even in cases where the officers
are above such sinful tricks as the doctoring
of ballot-boxes. If Bruce is given the indus-
trial powers he asks for, the Commonwealth
Parliament will be able, if it wants to, to
set up an authority to take an intelligent
interest in such subjects. Possibly that is
one reason why the crowd now in charge
of the unions finds the referenda proposals
so distasteful.
*
Very Like Mutiny.
Those A.L.P. and union bosses who com-
manded their subjects to oppose the exten-
sion of Commonwealth powers, and sacked
a N. S. Wales delegate to the Federal Labor
executive by way of warning, are finding the
going rougher than they bargained for. There
are indications of considerable Labor-
unionist support for Matthew Charlton,
who, ignoring threats of expulsion or selec-
tion-ballot disqualification (and adding
cubits to his political stature thereby), set
his hand to a manifesto stating that he must
support proposals which would give the
National Parliament “practically all the
power asked for in three of the questions sub-
mitted by the F'isher Government,” and most
of what he himself asked for in his policy
speech last year. The Australian Boot
Employees’ Federation and the Common-
wealth Council of Unions are among the
organisations which, like Charlton, are in
favor of the first (Industry and Commerce)
amendment, while jibbing—illogically, it is
true —at the second, which aims at empower-
ing the Commonwealth Government to “pro-
tect the interests of the public in case of
actual or probable interruption of any essen-
tial service.” The Young (N.S.W.) branch
of the A.L.P., in declaring for the first
amendment, said it did not care a dump for
its “tyrannous” State executive; and A. C.
Willis (imp.), who bossed that executive
till he became leader of the Leg. Council,
and who summoned what he called “an all-
Australian Trade-union Congress to give
unionists the only mandate” how to vote,
was severely snubbed for his pains. Accord-
ing to Willis (imp.), the Federal Labor
executive was guilty of “downright imper-
tinence” in deciding that Laborites might
vote as they pleased, but the organisations
which refused to have anything to do wit a
his “all-Australian Congress”—the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council, which plumps
for the first amendment, is one —probably
thought that the impertinence was on
Willis’s side. Further, the Victoria-
Riverina branch of the Australian Workers’
Union coldly rejected a head-office scheme
for financing the Anti cause by means ol
“voluntary” levies. Behind the “voluntary”
levy idea was the eminent Jack Bailey,
who, though disqualified as a Labor politi-
cian over a matter of ballot-boxes with slid-
ing-panels, is still a power in the A.W.U.;
and its defeat is an indication that a power-
ful section of the union is not prepared to
crucify Arthur Blakeley, M.H.R., who is
also an A.W.U. member, for signing the
Charlton manifesto. Many A.W.U. men
have unpleasant memories of a levy that
was struck for a Sydney daily newspaper
which has never been published. Many coal-
miners have spoken wrathfully of the lavish-
ing of union funds on a Sydney daily news-
paper which has been published. Many
members of the Seamen’s Union have conn
mented bitterly on the impoverishment of
an organisation which, if the Bob Guthrie
tradition had been maintained, would be in
a position to buy steamers and run them on
its own account. These proceedings and in-
numerable other abuses of executive autho-
rity have been made possible by the fact that
the Commonwealth Parliament has never had
the power to pass an adequate trade-union
law. If the Industry and Commerce amend-
ment is accepted it will have that power —
power to bring in an Act that will give the
members of unions full control over their
officials and their funds, that will protect
the interests of the branch and the indi-
vidual unionist, that will prevent such out-
rages as occurred in Queensland when coal-
miners were dragged into the local courts and
forced to contribute to the support of a mad
N. S. Wales strike which was launched with-
out reference with them, and which mopped up
£150,000 or £160,000 of union money. This
is one of the reasons why the Industry and
Commerce amendment is being supported
by sober-minded unionists and bitterly
fought by officials with a Red or a Tammany
streak.

The Tambar and a Matter of 6/5.
Tile Tas. Government still owns the Tambar,
plying between Melbourne, King Island and
the West Coast; but she does not pay. At
Strahan she is unloaded and loaded by the
Waterside Workers, whose union has a
monopoly of work on the wharf. On a
recent afternoon 15 members of this union
succeeded in placing 35 tons of Sin. iron pipe
on board the ship between 4.40 and 10.15
p.m. There were intervals of one hour for
tea and half an hour for smoko, leaving a
net working period of approximately four
hours. It amounts to ,llcwt. per man per
hour; the cost, at 3s. 9d. per hour, came to
6s. sd. per ton. The cost of dealing with
other cargo has been on a similar scale — 1
and the Tambar does not pay. The explana-
tion is not hard : the shipping of the port,
with increased costs in this and other ways,
has so steadily decreased that when a boat
does come in now she seems to be regarded
as a prize. The Waterside Workers’ charter
comes mainly from Justice Higgins. But
while concession after concession was granted,
not at the expense of the shipping com-
panies, which have passed on nearly all of
it, but at the cost of the primary producer
on the one part and of consumers on the
other, no provision whatever was made that,
for a payment of 3s. 9d. for an hour, work to
the value of 3s. 9d. shall be rendered. It is
extraordinary that a man versed in the pro-
blems of a complex social system should have
ignored the basic fact that the ordinary man
requires an incentive to render his fair share
of work to the community. In the wages or
salary man it is, or was, the fear of the
sack ; in the independent worker it is either
ambition or the grim skeleton of possible
failure standing beside him. In spite of this
quite obvious axiom, monopoly after monopoly
has been granted to the various unions by
Justice Higgins and his successors with
no safeguard whatever to protect those out-
side the pale. In view of the facts, one can
only remain astonished at the moderation
displayed by the men. As to the remedy, in
theory it is simple. Leave the standard of
wages as they are, but make them dependent
on a certain standard of work, the per-
centages rising and falling in harmony. It
has been a plank in the Labor party’s plat-
form on the mining fields to claim wages for
a contractor if his tonnage fails to secure
them. The same principle should apply
mutatis -mutandis. Let the downtrodden em-
ployer be assured that if there is not a just
presentment of work for the wages paid, lie
can fall back on a contract price equitably
determined. Difficulties, doubtless, there
would be, with strikes and dissensions and
sufferings, before any such settlement could
be achieved; but in olden days it was not
without bitter conflict that the stronghold
was destroyed of the robber baron who held
the path and levied blackmail on all who
would pass by. Meantime, will the Tambar
prove an example or a warning?
The Sorrowful Hun.
The periodical attack by German interests
on the mandatories of the ex-German
colonies takes the form, in its latest mani-
festation, of a bulky volume entitled “German
Colonisation, Past and Future.” The author
is Dr. Heinrich Sciinee, whom some Aus-
tralians will remember as a District Admini-
strator at Herbertshohe the old-time German
H.Q. in New Britain, now known by its
native name of Kokopo. Schnee was,
later, Deputy-Governor at Samoa, and then
Governor of German East Africa, so he can
claim a fair experience of German native
administration. The cool assurance, then,
with which he extols the vanished blessings
of German rule and sets out the atrocities of
British, Australian, Maoriland and Belgian
mandatories is all the more remarkable.
Tears ooze from him at the notion of native
races torn by main force from their beloved
German protectors and exposed to villainous
exploitation and extinction by disease with
which the mandatories are too tired to
wrestle. It is an ingenious farrago of false-
hood, evidently published to coincide with
the annual meetings of the League of
Nations’ mandatory committees which hold
periodical investigations into the admini-
stration of their trusts by the mandatories.
That these investigations should have refuted
the readied-up publication was only in accord-
ance with general expectation—outside the
German “Lost Colonies” League. There are
a good many Australians who can remember
the German administration in New Guinea
and New Britain before the war. The Ger-
man sat on the beaches, and to him inland
was a place of darkness inhabited by devils.
His occasional attempts to push in a few
miles were made with usually murderous con-
sequences to the native inhabitants. _ Flog-
ging was a commonplace of “colonial” exist-
ence. The immigration of Chinese and other
alien races, which had a disastrous effect on
the natives, was encouraged. “Recruiting”
of native labor was practically forced, and
natives were indentured for long terms and
low wages. Justice for the native in any
court was at a discount. Worst of all, the
recruiting of women was permitted equally
with that of male natives. These ladies,
indentured as “washerwomen” to bachelor
white men, were a feature of the German
administration of the early years of the
century. That the practice should have been
abolished under Australian rule is, no doubt,
one of the atrocities with which Schnee
charges our administration. Even Aus-
tralians near at hand are apt to admit the
German claim to have instituted a great
plantation scheme in New Britain and New
Ireland. In fact, the spadework had been
done long before they came, by such men as
Foksayth and others, British and Ameri-
can, who had entered on a settled policy of
development. It was in this period that
the local natives had their first taste of
British methods of colonisation, methods they
never ceased to contrast favorably with those
of the Germans in the years that followed,
just as they steadfastly refused to abandon
“pidgin” English and speak German, as their
new rulers attempted to force them to do.
The pleasure expressed by the New Guinea
native at the return of the British was no
figment of the imagination. Whoever else
may feel inclined to celebrate if the Hun
ever comes back to the bosom of his dusky
family, it certainly won’t be that family.

Murder in a Railway Carriage.
“Sol. Malaprop” : The central authority of
the Workers’ Union wired an imperative mes-
sage to Premier Collier of Westralia, tell-
ing him not to hang Rennie, the man who
killed a young bank-clerk in cold blood and
for sordid gain. Premier Collier sent an
unexpectedly snappy reply, and it is under-
stood that the matter will be “ventilated”
in conference, and that the local branch
will be instructed to take a short way with
the Collier Ministry when it finds the oppor-
tunity. It was also decided that Collier
is quite out of step with the Labor policy,
which is against capital punishment, resting
its case chiefly on the “Tliou shalt not kill”
of the Decalogue. This is probably the most
glaringly misapplied passage in Scripture,
for the obvious meaning is, not that the
law shall not slay Rennie, but that Rennie
shall not slay bank-clerks. If he does so,
the next chapter of Exodus says very speci-
fically what is to be done with him: “He
that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall
be surely put to death.” Holy Writ even
adds that if one man lies in wait for another
“to slay him with guile” (say with a gun
in a railway carriage) he shall be taken
even from the altar and scragged; yet the
altar was a very sacred place to the ancient
Hebrew. It is impossible to say what is
saving up for Labor leaders and others in
the next world by reason of their contemptu-
ous and almost blasphemous defiance of the
command in Exodus xxi, 12, but it is probably
something horrible and hot and continuous.
This especially applies when the manslayer
is released at the instigation of his member,
and sets out on a new career of crime, for
the member and others concerned are obvi-
ously responsible for the new crimes. They
will probably get an extra frizzle, if there is
any frizzle left. Some of the few hundred
commandments have dropped out by force
of circumstance; for instance the elaborate
regulations about the treatment of slaves are
more or less obsolete. But the instructions
concerning the short and sudden fate of the
person who wilfully slaughters a young
clerk in the train have lost none of their
applicability. Something similar may pos-
sibly be said about the command, in Exodus
xx, 9, that the working week shall be six
days, but some deviation may perhaps be
excused here. The invention of machinery
has altered the situation, and provided men
do enough to keep themselves and the country
out of debt it may be held sufficient. Still,
anti-capital-punishment people, humanitari-
ans, professional philanthropists, Peck-
sniffs and other viewy characters should
consider the situation in all its aspects. I
don’t absolutely make a point about my
own homicide being executed unless I am
there to see the event, but I certainly regard
execution as a preventive and an economy.
Its opponents are among those who “wrest
scriptures unto their own destruction,” as
the Scripture itself puts the matter.
The Army’s Meat Contracts.
Captain Choker, of the British Army Com-
missariat, is doing the round of Australia’s
meatworks, inspecting the supplies which are
being prepared under contract for Imperial
Army use. In addition, he is to report on
Australian -meatworks equipment, methods
of handling and shipment. So far his ex-
pressed satisfaction has helped to brighten
the faces of Australian meat-packers, who are
often growers into the bargain. To these
even the present ratio of British Army con-
tracts is an oasis in an otherwise arid pros-
pect, and an increase in their number would
be more than welcome. From Australia the
Captain goes on to the TJ.S.A., a reminder
that the Republic, like the Argentine gets
a solid cut of these lucrative Imperial con-
tracts. If Australia, the only country in
the Empire raising cattle on a wholesale
scale, could win the Empire Army’s business.
our cattle-breeders might dry those tears.
But herd standards will have to be raised
and transport methods improved and cheap-
ened before the most optimistic can begin to
think of that. The practical consideration
is whether a working agreement could not be
arrived at between the two parties (if we
are two parties)—the Empire and Australia.
We would certainly do the things we ought
to do if we were assured of getting the trade:
we can hardly be expected to go ahead on
the off-chance. We simply couldn’t afford
to do it.

Rubber and a Sore Head.
“Buttenderby” : In 1920 and ’2l, when
crude rubber was selling at about Bd. a
pound and the entire industry in the East
Indies was threatened with extinction, the
owners of motor-cars and other users of
rubber were on a good wicket. They were
buying the stuff at considerably under cost
of production. America, which uses about
75 p.c. of the world’s crude-rubber output,
was especially fortunate. The wealthiest
nation on earth enjoyed cheap tyre-mileage
in its 25-million cars, and if there was any
sympathy for the unhappy predicament of
the rubber-growers it was not made articu-
late. Then J. Bull, having pledged himself
to pay America about £IOO,OOO a day for
the next two or three generations, and not
being in the position to lose his £300,000,000
investment in the rubber trade, took a hand,
and in November, ’22, the Stephenson Act
was born. Briefly, this limited the export of
each producer to 60 p.c. of his standard pro-
duction, the object being to so restrict sales
that the price would be forced up to about
Is. 6d. a pound, which price was considered
fair to both grower and user. Provision was
also made for a graduated increase in ex-
ports, such increase to be entirely dependent
on the current price of rubber. This clause
was a clear intimation that Is. 6d, a pound
was to be regarded as a minimum, not a
maximum, price. The justification for this
piece of legislation is that it succeeded in
its object, and it is distinctly cheering to
learn that, despite official and unofficial
American protests, and a protracted press
propaganda which lacked nothing in acri-
mony, it is to stand —-indefinitely. America
complains that in ’25 the price of crude
rubber averaged 3s. a pound, or just double
the estimated “fair price,” thereby adding
£45,000,000 to its rubber bill. That is one
way of stating the case. Another is that, as
the Act does not discriminate in anyone’s
favor, the price being the same to all, the
individual American paid no more for his
tyres than did the Englishman or the China-
man. In fact, owing to his mass-production
and undoubted efficiency, he probably paid
considerably less. The president of the
American Rubber Association says, among
other things:—
American manufacturers, of course, could not
approve the Stephenson-scheme price levels, not only
on account of a varied opinion with respect to a
fair estimate of the costs, but because of the firm
belief that the law of supply and demand should
establish prices.
Well, the law of supply and demand was in
operation during ’2O and ’2l, and the result
was the ruinous price of Bd. a pound plus a
vast accumulation of stocks. It might be
pertinently asked to what extent, if any,
was supply and demand allowed to operate
in the prices charged the outside world for
petroleum and its by-products when Ameri-
can interests controlled that commodity?
Admittedly it was not a Government control,
but it was even more rigid than the Stephen-
son Act has proved to be. Britain, by far
the largest foreign user, didn’t question the
“estimate of costs,” nor was it ever sub-
mitted. She paid the exorbitant prices
demanded, while unobtrusively scouting
about for supplies elsewhere, with the result
that she now controls about half the world’s
output. Uncle Sam, on the other hand, though
clearly recognising that the effect of the
Stephenson Act would make crude rubber
dearer, has done nothing of a practical or
effective nature to meet the situation. With
limitless wealth at his disposal, and the
certain knowledge that he requires at least
75 p.c. of the entire output for his own use,
he produces only 3 p.c. of his requirements
and has made no effort to increase that
amount. Only a few weeks ago a large
tract of suitable country near the Panama
Canal zone was snapped up by an English
syndicate. The Stephenson Act has done
more than arouse Yankee indignation. It
has directed the world’s attention to America’s
complete dependence on foreign imports for
numerous essentials which it either does not
produce at all or only to a very negligible
extent. Rubber, coffee, tin, nitrates and
potash are a few of these items, and, repre-
senting as they do an enormous yearly expen-
diture and all of them subject to Govern-
mental or some sort of control, Jonathan
reckons he is being “gouged.” He is annoyed
about it, and his annoyance is not allayed by
the suspicion that the rest of the world is
rather enjoying the situation.

Some Goats and Their Friends.
Fob many years the British S’African colo-
nies, while eager enough to import Austra-
lian wool-sheep and dairy-cattle, were chary
of permitting outsiders to compete with them
in their own specialties. This was particu-
larly true of the ostrich and Angora goat-
breeders of Cape Colony and Natal. With
the advent of the Union, the stiff restrictions
on the export of ostriches and Angora breeds
were extended, and every effort made to keep
the industries as S’African monopolies.
Nevertheless, some Australian enthusiasts
have managed to establish Angora flocks,
though the total of the beasts for all Australia
is under 15,000. The Angora, like all his
brethren, is a good forager, and can live on
country which would starve a sheep. But
he is not fond of wet conditions, and lie is
one of the most unconfinable of four-footed
brutes. In South Africa the difficulty is
overcome by herding him, but in Australia,
with its much dearer labor, this is not prac-
ticable, though it is claimed by some Queens-
land breeders that their flocks can be trained
to respect the convention of a fence. The
difficulty of obtaining fresh blood has, how-
ever, done most of all to prevent the indus-
try from faring anything like as well in Aus-
tralia as its advocates hoped. It looks as
if this handicap is to be lightened at
last. The Afrikanders find that, with Aus-
irnlin’s kind help, they have succeeded in

establishing a flourishing fine-wool industry
which promises to be much more profitable
than growing mohair, and far more inde-
pendent of the caprices of fashion than
ostrich-farming. As a result the Angora-
Goat-Breeders’ Society is arranging to send
a number of stud Angoras to Australia for
sale here, since the demand for them at home
is so much poorer by reason of the increase
in favor of the fine-wool merino. This organ-
isation, which once did all that was possible
to prevent the export of Angoras, nowadays
not only has succeeded in raising the restric-
tions on export, but has asked its Minister
for Agriculture to get the Commonwealth
authorities to remove the existing obstacles
in the way of importing the beasts. These
obstacles are in the nature of quarantine, and
are aimed particularly against the introduc-
tion of rinderpest, the scourge of S’African
flocks and herds. New industries are always
welcome; but this country’s first duty lies
in looking well after the present and future
welfare of the vast sheep industry which is
its principal asset rather than in warming
the frozen-out Afrikander Angora in its
bosom.
The N. S. Wales A.L.P.
executive at a recent
meeting decided to ap-
point a deputation to
wait on the Minister of
Justice, first to ask his
reasons for the retire-
ment of Mr. Peisley, a
member of the Stipen-
diary Bench, and secondly
—in advance of what
those reasons might be—
to ask that such retire-
ment should be cancelled.
With the retirement of
Shaw, C.S.M., a vacancy
arose in the chairman-
ship of the Sydney Sti-
pendiary Bench. Peisley,
considering his long ser-
vice as a magistrate gave
him a claim to the office,
applied for it and was
heard by the Public Ser-
vice Board. That board,
in the exercise of its dis-
cretionary powers, ap-
pointed Jennings, S.M.
“Representations were
made to me,” says the
Minister of Justice, “to
over-ride the decision of
the board, but this I de-
clined to do. Mr. Peis-
ley then wrote a letter
to me couched in terms
which were grossly in-
sulting, containing un-
warranted reflections
upon those charged with
the administration of jus-
ti c e in the inferior
courts.” The outcome of
the matter was that Peis-
ley, who is not yet, by
about a year, of the re-
cognised retiring age of
65, was retired —quite
legitimately under the
provisions of the Public
Service Act. On the last
day of his public sitting
in court he made some
observations relative to
“suffering humanity,”
“harsh laws” and “social
inequalities.” Apparently
these crumbs of oratory
were not wasted. For the
position now seems to be
that, Mr. Peisley having
failed to impress his
claims on the Public Ser-
vice Board, and having
made a mess of his ap-
peal to the Minister, his
case has gone to the
fount of justice and
source of political power in N. S. Wales, the
A.L.P. executive, which, without waiting to
receive reasons or bothersome details of any
kind, has issued its mandate to the Minister
to return the gentleman to his seat. It
will be interesting to watch if the Govern-
ment will kiss the chastening hand, and do
as it is bidden. From the public point of
view the saddest feature of the business is
that the affairs of the judiciary should be so
dragged into the dirt of party politics.

"Trepex” : A fortunate condition of affairs
is ruling at present with regard to this ques-
tion of the deterioration of Australian wool—
if any, as the pleas in divorce say. N. S.
Wales, with its present stock of 45 million
sheep, is more heavily loaded than it has
been since about 1895. The number is in
excess of normal capacity, and needs to be
thinned down. Our stockowners have, there-
fore, an excellent opportunity for dispatch-
ing any undesirable element they may have
in their wool by judicious culling. And
something ought to be done to prevent a per-
petuation of these culls. Of course, some
men’s culls are better than some men’s tops,
but a line should be drawn somewhere. The
so-called deterioration of Australian wool is
not the dreadful menace that many people
say it is, but it is a pity if the good name
of our staple product is to be prejudiced by
the operations of that class of the
community which will always buy cheap
goods in the hope that they are high class
as well or, at least, can be sold as such.
There are the makings of a very pretty argu-
ment in the decision of Adelaide Uni. to
hold in the Cathedral the one religious ser-
vice that will fo.rm part of its approaching
jubilee. The non-Anglican element is very
strong in South Aus., and now recalls point-
edly that the very founding of the ’Var-
sity was due to it. About 1872 a Union
College got to work for higher training in
general, with an eye in particular to the
Presbyterian, Congregational and Baptist
ministries. When W. W. Hughes came
down with a £20,000 endowment, the pro-
moters unselfishly turned the secular part
of the work into a university instead. Still,
the Anglican Cathedral would be a first-rate
place for the proposed service— if the Bishop
of Adelaide can make the occasion general

“Feng-Shui” : Italy may have better luck
this time in her endeavor to “penetrate”
Abyssinia, having Britain’s assistance. Her
last attempt ended in the disastrous defeat of
Adowa, a battle that had ill effects on white
prestige everywhere in Asia, because it was
the first time in modern days that a colored
army had pulped a white antagonist. Britain
is interested in the black Christian kingdom
because the Blue Nile rises there and the
proposed Cape to Cairo railway route is
handy. Mussolini is concerned because he
owns Italian Somaliland on the one hand
and Erithea on the other and would like to
join them with a railway. Australia has a
sentimental connection with the harassed
country, too. About 20 years ago the inhabi-
tants were mainly nomad. Settlement was
governed by the available supply of timber.
When the capital used up the neighboring
forest it moved on to another wooded site.
This went on until the representatives of
foreign Powers and businesses got tired of
moving, and somebody suggested planting
Australian bluegums. To-day the Abyssinian
is a more or less stationary and civilised
citizen because of the splendid groves of
trees now flourishing everywhere in his
country.

“H. Horsecollar” : In criticising my modern
history of Mesopotamia, “Basra” suggests
a man who hasn’t taken over-much trouble
to masticate his topic. The relative pro-
portions of white and colored troops may
have remained much the same all through the
campaign, but there were more white troops
when success was achieved, which helps 1o
explain the success. More men were lost in
the effort to relieve the garrison of Kut than
the garrison amounted to. The final failure
of the relief expedition has been set down
freely to the inability of the Asiatic troops
to measure up to a European standard. It
was a case of frontal attack on the Turkish
trenches because circumstances made a turn-
ing movement impossible and because it was
a race against time. The white men got
into the trenches at terrible sacrifice, and lost
them again because their supports stopped
halfway. I don’t say that the large proper-
tion of Indian troops inside Kut caused its
fall, but I believe the large proportion out-
side did. The 13th (pure white) division
arrived in Mesopotamia before the surrender,
as “Basra” says; there would have been more
of it alive at the date of surrender if it had
been vigorously backed up. As regards
decorations, I have seen a list which specified
seven persons then living as having won the
Victoria Cross in Mesopotamia, and six of
them were white. That was in 1920. There
are (so far as I can count) 490 surviving
Victoria Crossers, ten of them natives of
India—dashed few on a population basis.
I don’t deny that the Indian fights as well
as he knows how; I will even admit that
he would fight better if he knew how.

The Performing Rights Association, whose
demands upon owners of halls have infuri-
ated Australian aldermen with the deeply-
rooted belief (not, of course peculiar to
Australian aldermen) that writers and com-
posers should live on air, has finished a pro-
tracted argument with the broadcasting com-
panies, too. Claiming to represent the copy-
right holders of 98 n,c. of the material likely
to be used by performers, it asked for 10 p.c.
of the broadcasting cos.’ revenue, under-
taking to split its net income amongst its
subscribers in proportion to the use made of
their productions: but at a conference
arranged by the Priminister it offered to
accept 10 p.c. on the first 100,000 licenses
in any State and 5 p.c. on those in excess
of 100,000, after deduction of the ss. due
to Amalgamated Wireless for patent rights
and the 2s. 6d. collected by the Postmaster-
General. This was agreed to. The arrange-
ment will benefit the growing band of Aus-
tralian composers, and should have impor-
tant results to Australian writers, indirectly,
at least. It indicates a line along which
the A.J.A. may tackle newspaper proprietors
who have grown wealthy by stealing copy-
right stuff, and thereby keeping authors out
of a job.
O
“Spare Corp.” : The Randwick Military
Hospital is at last to be taken over by
the N.S.W. Government. The place was
the Orphanage until wounded and sick Dig-
gers began to come back from the war in
boatloads, when it was used for their
accommodation under the name of the Prince
of Wales Hospital. It was years after the
war had ceased that it began to empty, and
then it was proposed to convert it into
an auxiliary civil hospital; but the Fuller
Government baulked at the demand that
the State should take over the military
patients still in the wards. The result has
been that only a small portion of the capa-
cious whole has been in use recently. Now
an agreement has been reached by which the
Federal Government retains the use of the
wards still required for ex-Diggers, while
the State takes over the rest for a hospital
of some so-t. The State also gets, free of cost,
a number of buildings erected by the Com-
monwealth and a job-lot of furnishings to
which nobody’s title is very clear. In the
chaotic war days the furnishings came from
all quarters, and nobody has been able to
say exactly which of them were State pro-
perty, which were lent by the Red Cross
and other societies and which were Com-
monwealth purchases.

Turkey has had changes in recent years.
It abolished the empire and substituted a
sort of republic and a one-House Parliament
which was to go to its constituents every
two years, but early decided to stay a while
longer. It abolished the Sultan, and the
Parliament made Ivemal president for two
years (Kemal and his army were an influ-
ence). That bright young man (45) seems likely
to Kemal indefinitely. (The last ex-Sultan
died abroad, allegedly through poison, and
, his body was detained for debt.) New
Turkey professed to abolish the Caliphate,
which is the common property of Islam. It
shifted the capital to Angora, where the
goats come from. It ordered that the hard
hat should take the place of the fez and
turban, and commanded that males who still
affected skirts should take to pants. The
new regime let women out of the harem and
allowed them to go unveiled, so that men
began to see more of other men’s wives,
which doesn’t always lead to peace of mind.
Also it abolished polygamy and put the
sexes on an equality in the matter of divorce.
Still, to judge by the recent tale of the
public and very unpleasant execution of 18
men who were said to object to Kemal,
Turkey is much the same old gallinaceous
fowl. The failure to pay interest on the
public debt confirms this view.
<►
X2X”: Although the causatory organism
of dengue fever has not yet been isolated,
probably because it is too minute for ordi-
nary microscopic work, it looks as if it were
closely allied to the bacillus of malaria. The
carrier of the organism is undoubtedly the
anopheline mosquito, which is also the
carrier of the malarial germ; the symptoms
of the two diseases are in many ways almost
identical, while the same medicinal agents
can be used to combat both. In this there
is a grave warning for Australia, for should
dengue become endemic along the eastern sea-
board, as it is quite likely to do, it may be to
the Commonwealth what malaria is to other
countries. Already there are towns in Queens-
land which seem to be the starting-point of
the disease, and during the last three or
four months it has been firmly entrenched in
them. For the first time it has appeared in
Sydney, and its range is apparently along most
of the coastal belt from Central Queensland to
the N. S. Wales capital. There is only one
way in which it can be attacked, and that
is by a campaign against the mosquito
which is the carrier. While it would be im-
possible to eradicate the anopheles in all
its breeding-places along the coast, a good
deal could be done in this direction in the
neighborhood of the towms. Yet in the
majority of places, even including stridden
centres, the authorities have done nothing
whatever. The longer me anopheles is let
alone the more costly will be the work of
eradication.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Bruce’s £20,000,000 road scheme has gone
all awry. While a sometliing-for-no thing
dole was in prospect the States were willing,
but when it came to the Commonwealth
levying a petrol-tax and something extra on
tyres there was opposition from nationalists
and provincialists alike. Gunn prompted the
S.A. Assembly to throw out the proposal,
and Allan at the week-end showed a dis-
position to let the Vic. Assembly do likewise.
N.S.W. wouldn’t come into the scheme, and
none of the other States is enthusiastic. The
Roads Aids Bill was to have been a star
item in the Reps, on Friday, but it was
side-tracked. Bruce and Page would do well
to drop the whole foolish business and get
on with their own job, especially the North-
South railway and defence.
Redistribution of seats was not among the
measures outlined by the Westralian Labor
Ministry in commencing its last session. This
means that Westralian Labor now supports
an arrangement of boundaries which it furi-
ously denounced when introduced by the late
Frank Wilson, and which, in the course of
15 years, has grown a hundred times worse;
it means that a party professing to believe
in the onc-vote-one-value principle actually
stands for giving goldfields votes 15 times
the value of metropolitan votes. The Bul-
letin thought better of Collier and Angwin.
After a run of nearly 21 months the Allan-
Peacock Cabinet (Vic.) is feeling rocky. On
Thursday Snowball, the Independent Lib.
from Brighton, launched a no-confidence
amendment on the Commonwealth road-
grant issue. Allan defied Snowball and. all
on the Speaker’s right who might be think-
ing with him, and then Brighton’s choice
wanted to retreat. Hogan, leader of the
Labor Opposition, saw to it that a standing
order barred the way, but an amendment
on the amendment will let Snowball out. It
looks as if the real rest will come on the
Seats Redivision Bill.
Tasmania, which Willie Watt calls “a
sluggard State,” for ever “holding out its
hand for a tip,” reduced its loan expenditure
to £242,000 in the latest year for which
Wickens gives details. N. S. Wales melted
£9,175,000, Victoria £8,799,000, Westralia
£4,099,000, Queensland £4,081,000 and S.
Aus. £3,520,000. Had Watt known these
facts before he spoke lie might have reserved
his scorn for the Speck’s shiftless relations
who persist in holding out their hats to the
war- and strike-smitten Old Man.
The refusal of the Mackay (Q.) sugar-
mill workers to handle cane grown _ by
Italians has the makings of a nasty situa-
tion. Italian cane-farmers, who are thick
in the district, have forwarded protests to
the Queensland and Federal Governments, as
well as to those of Britain and Italy, and
it is from this last quarter that trouble
may come. The Queensland Government has
sent up William Dunstan, once A.W.U.
branch secretary and now a member of the
Board of Trade, to see what he can do. The
millhands are A.W.U. members, and as Dun-
stan, in his secretarial days, was in the van
of the objectors to the Italian invasion, the
situation has its comic aspects. But there
is one thing certain: Australia cant afford
to fall out with a good customer for the sake
of a parcel of militants who claim the right
to condemn other people’s property to de-
struction.
" AND THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER."
There is a howl in Queensland because
Parliament is going to award itself a 50 p.c.
rise—to £750 a year. The “Tories,” it is
mentioned, never did this when they had .a
worse deficit than usual. Certainly it is
well over the odds for a freshly-elected Par-
liament to put up rates of pay; but the
other plan of cutting down salaries of Minis-
ters and members has precious little to re-
commend it either. When things go wrong
in a business you don’t often improve them
by cutting down screws and thus getting
poorer men in to run the show; there is far
more hope from putting up the pay and
attracting a better staff.
The rotary strike resumed the other day at
Bowen (Q.), where there was a similar event
some months ago. with foreigners waving
revolvers and other demonstrations. . The
demand is that w T ork shall be distributed
equally, in rotation, among goo.d and bad
men, toilers and shirkers; and the Board or
Trade has ordered a trial of it. No member
of the party has yet suggested a rotary
arrangement for politicians, yet after a man
has enjoyed a three-years’ shift in Parlia-
ment it seems brotherly to stand out and
let the other fellows rotate a bit.
A State loan (not a municipal one) for
the improvement of the old parks of Sydney
and the creation of new ones is spoken of,
and Minister Loughlin promises to “go to
work on a wholesale basis” when and if the
money is forthcoming. It is no worse than
many previous wild-cat loan schemes, but
each new cat hastens the time when lenders
will ask about the kind of “permanent and
reproductive works” which are security for
their money. It may be a mere kitten which
will make the trouble, aud not a cat at all.
Some Yankee money-king is frequently re-
ported to be prowling round offering loans,
a recent one being “a banker from Rhode
Island,” population 600,000. But Uncle
wants a sinking fund, payment at maturity
and no renewals. He is a person of little
faith, and lends on the limited liability plan
—when he does lend, which he mostly doesn t.
Foreign-traders have high hopes of a new
“party” said to have been formed in the
House of Reps. The “party” consists at
present of Stewart (Wimmera), who has
quitted the Cocky room, and Mann (Perth),
who no longer attends the Nationalist
caucus; but Gregory (Swan) is expected to
join at any moment. Mann’s secession
caused some surprise in Melbourne, but
readers of a column wired from the Federal
Parliament to Westralia were prepared for
it. They have noted with amusement the
writer’s high opinion of Mann and his “closely
reasoned” speeches and his diminishing re-
spect for a crowd which callously ignores
the close reasoner when good things are
being given out.
The Governor of Pentridge (Melb.) Gaol
was punched good and hard the other day
by a prisoner—“with no apparent reason,”
the reports say. But, of course, there is a
reason, or, at any rate, an explanation; and
it will probably be found in a spirit of revolt
which is pretty general in Pentridge and
worse still in Geelong. It is not easy to get
at the facts regarding gaol administration,
but The Bulletin is satisfied that Peacock
or some other experienced “head"’ ought to
make an inquiry into the matter. In par-
ticular, are some warders guilty of taunting
jirisoners?
Percy Coleman, M.11.R. for Reid (N.S.W.),
tried to ginger up the House of Reps, debate
on the League of Nations by attacking secret
diplomacy. Coleman should know something
about it, for his seat is supposed to be the
one Premier Lang has earmarked for him-
self when he hops out of the frying-pan
of N.S.W. politics into the Federal fire.
Moreover, his party doesn’t exactly have a
brass band to whip up the crowd to its
caucuses and faction conferences; and the
difficulty of finding out the truth about ballot-
boxes with sliding panels has been tremen-
dous. There are not many secret-diplomacy
tricks that European chancelleries can show
our sturdy fellows.
The Hun has returned to the subject of
his “stolen” colonies. The Union of
Colonial Societies last week put the hard
word on the Chancellor, begging him to hold
Germania back from the League of Nations
till the return of the German colonies shall
have been agreed upon. The Union is especi-
ally pained at Chamberlain’s hint that Ger-
man East Africa is practically a permanent
British possession. It argued, with tears in
its voice, that this amounted to annexation
without compensation. Apparently Fritz
overlooked his own annexation of Alsace-
Lorraine 55 years ago. _ Not only was tins
done without compensation, but a thundering
sum in cash was extracted also from the
owners. It is about time the mandate hypoc-
risy was thrown aside, and actual as well
as virtual possession vested in the present
holders.
In Maoriland every town with a popula-
tion of 1000 or more must furnish itself with
a town-planning scheme to provide for the
future. It must be no botch either, but one
approved by a board of experts. A shriek
of ridicule would probably arise if this was
proposed, say, in Victoria or N. S. Wales.
The idea of Picton and Bathurst, or
even Portland and Eden, having a future!
But in Maoriland any decently-situated small
town feels like a private with a marshal's
baton in his swag. Principally by the dis-
tribution of its railways the island Dominion
manages to cultivate a foreign trade at 19
different ports, and it is always expecting a
new town of some sort to turn up.
“Legalised Elimination of the Unborn in
Soviet Russia” is the title of an article which
Piddington, K.G., quoted before the N.S.W.
Standard of Living Commission. Abortion,
it seems, is permitted in Russia under Gov-
ernment restriction, and by qualified officials.
What dismayed Piddington was the great
increase of women availing themselves of
the law since it was promulgated in 1920,
and the fact,that in. 72 per cent, of the cases
permission has been granted on account of
the mother’s “extreme poverty.” The same
day a press cable made George Lansbury, of
the Daily Herald, tell a Leningrad audience
that Russia was Paradise compared with
Britain. A paradise which runs a State
system of abortion to minimise “extreme
poverty” is a new one.
Feelers are being thrown out as to the
possibility of raising the “reimbursement” of
Vic. Assembly members from £5OO to £6OO a
year and that of Uppah House members from
£2OO to £250 or £3OO. Before 1921 the rate
for Assemblymen was £3OO and for Coun-
cillors nothing. Ministers and elective
officers of the Houses do not draw any
screw as members. Premier Allan gets
£1450, Treasurer Peacock £1350, six other
Ministers and Speaker Bowser £l2OO each,
Council-President Clarke £750, Billson (As-
sembly Chairman of Committees) £740, and
Edgar (Council Chairman of Committees)
£4OO. If the rise for private members comes
off, of course there will be corresponding lifts
all round. For aren’t we all deserving?
The chief of the Canadian General Staff,
commenting on the irritation caused in Asia
by the protective measures of Pacific coun-
tries —the White Australia policy, among
others —said that Uncle Sam’s erection of
wireless stations in the Aleutian Islands was
breeding suspicion in Nippon. But Sam
explained that some time ago. The wireless
has been put there to report the movements
of the shoals of salmon making in to spawn
in the rivers of Alaska, where they are an
important item of revenue. The establish-
ment of aeroplane bases is explained in the
same way. Perhaps if Pearce starts a turtle
cannery in his new Dominion of North Aus-
tralia, we shall be freed from the necessity
of making excuses about the Singapore naval
base.
In days of old, when politicians were bolder,
it was the custom of Governments to fore-
shadow, in the Budget or the “Speech” deli-
vered by the reigning rubber-stamp, what
they intended to do with themselves during
the ensuing 12 months. The practice was
dropped in Maoriland some years ago, it
having been discovered that legislative pro-
grammes are a mistake. They give the Oppo-
sition too much to talk about, and very often
it isn’t advisable to carry them out. In any
case, the people now in power are of opinion,
as a matter of tradition, that there are far
too many laws on the Statute Book as it
is. Probably they are right, but they will
have to go on making a few more each year
for the look of the thing.
“Stellsby” : It isn’t always the land that’s
to blame. On the Wollaston soldier settle-
ment (Vic.) two abandoned blocks were put
up for auction by the Closer Settlement
Board. One block of 29J acres went at
£69 an acre; the other, 32-J acres, was
knocked down at £65 an acre. x\nd it doesn’t
follow that the men were to blame, either.
The people who are to blame are the fools
who thought that anybody can make a do
of it on the land.
Pollard, the young Labor member for Dal-
housie (Vic.), made an ass of himself the
other night; but he was nearly as right as the
Minister of Railways, whom he accused of
supplying the House with wrong information.
The row gave the department a fright, at all
events ; next morning “all stations” were called
up for information about these small trucks
that all the trouble was about. And the
chances are that the information it got was
the sort the Minister had already got; subtle
half-truths are the usual replies when that
sort of whip goes out.

“Mr. Kay, the M.L.A. returned to the N.S.W.
Assembly on the Independent ticket, said that he was
assured by the Premier that he had the requisite
administrative and commercial ability to fill a £l5OO
a year job on the Meat Board. He had accepted the
offer because he felt he could render valuable service
to the public in his new capacity.”
Mr. L.:
Time was, ’tis true, your voice each Sunday rose
Shrillest among the ranks of Labor’s foes.
Hired to denounce and fluent to inveigh,
You took your orders and you earned your pay.
But spite of all that pestilential yap
I always reckoned you a brainy chap.
Let bygones, then, be bygones. Here, I hope,
’S a billet that will give your talents scope,
A job that many in my faithful band
Of followers would give their ears to land;
But diligently as I’ve scanned them through
I can find none as well-equipped as you.
Mr. K. ( diffidently ) :
H’m—thirty pound a week. D’you think I can
Earn it ?
Mr. L.:
Unquestionably you’re the man.
What though you never killed or dressed a beast,
It won’t impair your fitness in the least;
What though your knowledge of the meat trade stops
At ordering porterhouse or mutton chops,
You have the higher requisites that count,
Cheek quantum suff. and pluck in any amount;
Industry, energy and moral worth—
These are the things that mark you for the bertn.
Mr. K.:
To such an estimate I can but bow.
But won’t it raise a devil of a row?
Mr. L. (bitterly) :
Aye, motives vile they will impute, be sure,
The men who judge by their own code impure.
Why should we care what snarling critics say
Who know ourselves as honest as the day ?
’Tis true a Laborite will fill your seat
When you abandon statesmanship for meat,
One with the Caucus brand upon his hide,
Bound to allegiance which you denied —
Else had you never M.L.A. been writ.
But does that influence me? No, not a bit!
The curs that bark distrust, the ass that brays
Resentment and the geese that hiss dispraise
Or cackle calumny, I can ignore
Who seek the welfare of the State —no more.
Mr. K. (carried away by equally generous emotion) :
I, too, can see where patriotism points
My path towards the carcases and joints.
Pr o bono publico you may bespeak
My services at thirty quid a week.
My Parliamentary job I chuck to-day
At duty’s stirring call.
Mr. L.:
Good on you, Kay 1

With improvement showing in almost every
figure, chairman Mark Sheldon felt it neces-
sary to point out that Australia’s present
prosperity is part-based on loans. And he
uttered the warning, regularly made by
bankers and as regularly ignored by poli-
ticians, of the depression which inevitably
will follow a withdrawal of loan support.
Fortunately manufacturing is progressing
steadily in the Commonwealth —the tariff
increases have given it an impetus—and our
primary industries are doing well, despite
the inevitable fluctuations which follow the
weather. Last year was not comparable with
the opulent 12 months which preceded it, but
it was prosperous almost generally. Only
in central-west Queensland was. there any
severe setback. The immediate future looks
good. Sugar certainly will crop much less
heavily than last cutting—probably as much
as 200,000 tons. There will be more than
sufficient for domestic needs, however. The
hoard is fully aware of the dangers con-
tained in the loan-mongering activities of the
Governments, in experimental legislation, in
the always-possible drought. But that it is
satisfied with the bank’s position is indicated
by the increase in the div. to 8 p.c. The 8 p.c.
called for £147,200 last year—£63,2oo more
than the 7 p.c. demanded in 1924. Offsetting
that, though, is the reduction in the amount
of interest paid on the inscribed deposits:
£8472 last year ; £50,230 in 1924. Less than.
75 p.c. of the profits disclosed were distri-
buted, and the addition of £50,743 raised
visible reserves to £845,303. The operation
in the previous year, whereby fully-paid
shares to the amount of £638,872 were ex-
changed for £958,307 of inscribed deposits,
gave a big lift to reserves. Although visible
accumulations amoum to not quite half the
total of paid capital, they are a handy sup-
port, and the £200,963 (£244,079 at the 1925
balance) of inscribed stock which has not
been converted is of assistance—-it carries
only 4 p.c. The internal position may be
accepted as satisfactory so far as a cautious
management can estimate; and £lO,OOO is
taken each year from profits and written off
the book value of premises. Continuance of
this policy of strengthening the bank’s posi-
tion will win further rewards.
The A.B.C. has gone ahead remarkably
since it took over the City Bank of Sydney
in 1918. The 8 p.c. div. is the most favorable
expression of the progress—it is twice as
much as that paid in 1918. These figures
give one view of the movement: —

Including the inscribed deposits in total
funds the bank was holding at June 30
£4 15s. lOd. of the public’s money for each
£1 of its own; at the previous balance it
held £4 6s. 5d., and in 1924 less than £4.
It still is in a position to extend its list
of borrowers, although the increase in
advances of £1.210,659 in the 12 months was
greater than the gain in deposits. The de-
mand for accommodation is strong, which
gives the bank a selection of risks, and as it
is adding to its branches (chief addition last
year was Perth, thereby completing the chain
round the coast from North Queensland) it
is not likely to want in borrowers. Here
are comparisons of liabilities:—

The increase in liquid assets was not con-
siderable, but they are still in excess of the
amount usually looked upon as adequate. The
net increase in premises was small; “the
management considers it preferable to utilise
the bank’s resources in meeting the require-
ments of customers.’’ Of the liquids a fur-
ther increase was registered in coin and

Since the righting of the exchange position the
increase in bills on London is of little
moment.
The articles of association came under re-
view at the annual meeting. The deletion of
useless clauses relating to note circulation;
alterations to fulfil requirements of the
London Stock Exchange (the scrip is to be
listed) ; and increase of the nominal capital
to £5,000,000 were approved. Shareholders
were informed that there is no immediate
intention of making any fresh issue. Mean-
time the div. seems assured at 8 p.c., with
possibilities. Last year’s disclosed profit was
equal to 10,7 p.c. on paid capital. A man-
agement as keen as that of the A.B.C. is not
likely to narrow its additions to reserves,
however, until its position is visibly stronger,
particularly since it has done so handsomely
for shareholders of recent years.

The interim div. at the rate of 10 p.c. came
as a surprise to the market, for it had been
generally understood that there would be no
advance until reserves had been built up to
the million mark. The impression seemed to
be endorsed by the management; so the in-
crease to 10 p.c. may be taken to imply com-
plete satisfaction with the bank’s internal
strength. Latterly visible increases to re-
serves have been roughly £50,000 p.a. Undis-
closed profits may have been substantial, and
probably have been; the Victoria has a very
solid pastoral connection, and that’s where
the fat cheques have been lately. Year after
year conservative bankers have told them-
selves that the money-making conditions were
too good to last, and in that belief have
provided for contingencies; and year after
year the good conditions have continued and
the bad debts that were provided for have
turned out to be good debts and have been
liquidated. Few if any bankers are credu-
lous enough to believe that the bad times
will never come now; what cheers them —
and what may well cheer investors—is that,
as the result of the long series of surprisingly
good years, fine inner reserves have been
built up. In all the circumstances manage-
ments have felt themselves justified in show-
ing, as in this case, a very substantial in-
crease of profits. For the 12 months ended
June 30 these were equal to 8.4 p.c. on
average visible funds, and that is a fine
return, even if nothing was put by inside.
The next table shows in more detail how
the disclosed profit was reached: —

Despite the increase of £11,530 in the out-
goings, the increase in gross income was
such as to make net profits £11,127 greater
than those disclosed in the previous year.
The question, of course, to consider is
whether under poorer conditions it will be
possible to bring these exes, down again. To
a great extent it probably won’t be unless the
banks come to a better understanding about
branches. Australia perhaps hasn’t got any
more banks than are good for it, but it cer-
tainly has a vast deal too many branches.
There is some satisfaction in knowing that
there is room for economies here when
economy is called for, as it will he some day.
Balance-sheet figures for the past year
show very notable progress:—

Premises, etc. . . 343,728 438,248 441,875
An increase of more than three-quarters of
a million in fixed deposits was due in large
part to the remarkable prosperity in the
pastoral industry. No doubt another factor
in producing the larger figures was the
greater enterprise exhibited of late years by
Australian banks in general. For a good
while following the ’nineties vigor was rather
frowned upon in the high places of Austra-
lian banks: but the time came when it was
recognised that you could get good banking
business by going after it almost as easily
as you can get bad banking business by
merely sitting down and waiting for it. Cer-
tainly the Victoria isn’t in the forefront of the
“go-getters”; for more than 25 years capital
has remained unchanged at £1,478,010 in
41,676 £lO profs, fully paid and 212,250 £lO
ordinaries paid, to £5. With the exception
of the Adelaide and London branches, its
offices are confined to Victoria.
Advances increased by £836,654, but the
liquid position was still kept well above
the safety level: 42.7 p.c. of total outside
liabilities were handy. For the balance not
covered by liquids (£7,628,252) there were
advances with a book value of £9,627,345
and bank premises down at £441,875; and
there is £1,061.250 callable on the ords. The
future is full of uncertainties; but the Vic.
has every appearance of falling into regular
10 p.c. habits.

Net profit was greater for the 12 months by
£1294, hut there were more shares to feed,
48,851 of the 50,000 offered at par to share-
holders in February having been taken up.
The directors report results as very satis-
factory, with business continuing to improve
“Extensive additions to both buildings and
plant are being made in order to cope with
the demand, and to further increase the co.’s
activities.” The div. is, nevertheless, cut
down by 21 p.c. without explanation, but the
new issue of capital during the year tempers
the wind to the shorn lambs. In the past
the board has been considered generous in its
treatment of shareholders; but the policy
seems to have been justified by the rapid
progress of reserves. Yet they are still
on the small side. In 1915 capital,
it has to be remembered, was only
£60,000; at June 30 last it was £298,851.
In 1923 the co. took over Breheny’s brewery
at Toowoomba, and has been busy since con-
solidating its position in the southern and
south-western parts of the State. Its rapid
progress has drastically altered balance-sheet
figures, and last year’s movements were the
greatest yet: not only was the new capital
utilised, hut the co. went outside for a solid
amount:—

Cash, etc... 10,926 9,846 3,510 3,910 4,685
Reserves, as already indicated, are only mod-
erate compared with the increased capital;
considering the £265,243 in property and
plant and the £114,411 owing to outsiders,
they are, in fact, quite modest. But in addi-
tion to the £65,000 shown in the introductory
table there is a contingency reserve of
£30,553, and that is probably accumulated
profit, too; certainly its treatment in the
past suggests that it is.
The return of Labor to office in Queens-
land represents a continuance, so far as lays
in its power, of the policy of increasing
wages and unbridled loan expenditure, and
the beer-foundries will be kept busy meet-
ing the demand that is based on that arti-
ficial prosperity. The present dry spell'
affects part of the territory where the co.
has a hold, but the more important Dryness
sought by the Cold-Tea Army seems, at the
moment, to be only a shadow; neverthe-
less, the capacity of the Dry forces to
put up a sudden scrap cannot be overlooked
when provision is made for contingencies.
Allowance for depreciation is not specified;
amounts shown in the introductory table re-
present additions to the contingency reserve.
This is now so substantial that there were
hopes of a bonus distribution this year, and
the market was rather disappointed when
nothing happened. Gross profits for the year
amounted to £214,397 compared with
£207,558 for 1925 ; but most of the gain was
mopped up by increased expenditure. Pre-
sent paid capital will call for £29,885 on a
10 p.c. basis, and last year’s disclosed profit
could have met that with ease. Nothing
is visible to suggest further unfavorable
variation in the div. rate, and shareholders
have been so liberally treated in the matter
of par issues in the past three years that
10 p.c. reads well. Despite the leap in
liabilities, the financial position was easy,
liquid and semi-liquid assets amounting to
more than twice the outside debt. The co. is
now the most vigorous among northern
brewers, and the spectre of the co-operative
brewery which occasionally rises in some of
the other States is practically not known in
Queensland. In any case, this co.’s long
chain of tied houses assures it of a big,
cheaply-held trade.

The year carried more than its fair swag
of troubles. Underground work stopped on
August 28 owing to the strike of Queens-
land railwaymen, and on September 12 a
fire broke out in the main hauling shaft. The
mine had to be flooded, and a big settlement
took place in the open-cut. In the first three
months of the year that were fairly free
from trouble 59,436 tons of ore was ex-
tracted. Unwatering started on November
7, and for a while six tons of copper per
week was saved as precipitates from the
3-400,000 gallons pumped daily. Later the
liquor was weaker, and the water is now
being held underground to be used in the
mill. But shareholders didn’t worry over
the poor production; in the four preceding
years almost a million tons was torn out,
and, despite nearly £200,000 received from
investments, the net losses were £176,778.
It would have been better business to shut
down and save the ore; but the board is old-
fashioned, and has worked hard to keep the
staff employed despite all sorts of discourag-
ments. The latest problem to be faced is
a claim by the workers for further wage in-
creases. To some of those interested this
is the last straw, and there is a louder de-
mand for liquidation and the distribution of
the assets. The board has held this movement
off thus far, and there is no hint of any
departure from that policy. It prefers to
hang on and investigate the possibilities of
large-scale working by steam or electric
shovels in the open-cut, concentration of the
ore, roasting the concentrates, smelting the
calcines in a reverb, and blowing the matte
to blister in a new converter plant. Whether
anything much can be done will be governed
by the decision of the Board of Trade, which
is now hearing the case. Unless new develop-
ments sidetrack the plan, the idea is to
run a pilot plant, and the reverb, which
Wallaroo and Moonta had commenced to
instal prior to its collapse has been bought
and is now being put in; calcined concen-
trates sufficient to run a campaign are being
accumulated. A start will probably be made
next month, but it will be 12 months before
certainty is reached about results. If they
are favorable, finance and construction will
eat more months; so, at- the best, share-
holders can resign themselves to a long wait.
Mining for the limited period resulted in
blister worth £202,388, which sundry income
raised to £203,488; expenditure, including
development, depreciation and damage as a
result of the fire, was £276,325, the year’s
loss being £72,837, which a net £69,561 from
investments reduced to £3276. The price
realised for electrolytic was £6B os. Id. com-
pared with £6B 13s. Bd. in 1925 and £73 7s.

The low cost of installing Pioneer Wood Pipe is
one of its most distinct advantages—and well worth
considering. It is so light that, from the time it
leaves the factory to the laying of the last pipe,
freight transport and handling costs are by far the
lowest of any pipe made. Its ability to negotiate
sharp and precipitous contours is enhanced by its
great strength and durability. Its increasing,
instead of decreasing, capacity over many years of
economical and trouble-free service make it a' conduit
of exceptional merit, maintaining a perfection bore,
free from internal growths and impurities, not
possible in metal piping—which rusts, corrodes and

At May 31, 1925, the quantity of copper on
hand was 1387 tons, and that was taken in
at £55, whereas realisation was on the basis
of £6B Os. Id. Thus last year benefited by
the difference, which throws another clod at
the year’s results, because the quantity on
hand at the end of the term was negligible.
Recoveries, already remarkably good, were
improved. Here is five years’ progress:—

But the cost of getting that extra .58 p.c.

Should the proposed new methods prove to
be commercially possible ore reserves will be
increased from 2,700,000 tons to 8,000,000
tons. Production for the period was, of
course, unimportant: 1491 tons copper and
17,0100 z. gold.

Stocks and stores were reduced, but liabili-

a gain in the liquid surplus, and creditors
can see £4 in cash or Government stocks for
every pound owing. Those who are anxious

The value of those holdings may be esti-
mated from the £70,077 received. Net
liquids (including these share investments
“at cost”) on May 31 amounted to just over
15s. per share, and there was the mine and
plant in the books at £1,133,100 less
£461,993 written off; 8,000,000 tons of re-
serves, 25 p.c. at least going 2.61 p.c. copper
and 6dwt. gold; and one of the finest plants
in the world. The value of the plant and
the mine depends on whether the co.’s pro-
posed method of treatment proves profitable;
and the copper market may interfere even
then, although the downward drift in prices
has become very slow. The Stock Exchange
opinion of the scrip is less than 9s. —sales
have been made at Bs. 9d.

Great Boulder and Sons of Gwalia, two
of Westralia’s greatest producers, may close
down unless economic conditions speedily im-
prove. Both have yielded millions of pounds’
worth of bullion and, after paying millions
and one million respectively in divs., both are
said to need a Government bonus to keep
them alive. In Great Boulder’s case amal-
gamation with adjoining mines is suggested
as an alternative to a bonus, but jealousy
and the abolition of snug billets are big
obstacles in the way of this. There is, as
The Bulletin has repeatedly pointed out,
another way in which the Boulder and other
decadent Kalgoorlie mines might be made to
pay for many years, and that is by pooling
funds and erecting a central up-to-date treat-
ment plant. This would enable large ton-
nages of low-grade ore just below present
pay limits to be profitably crushed. Sons of
Gwalia Co. is working an isolated gold deposit,
and in its case amalgamation is out of the
question. For some time past it has com-
plained bitterly of the burdens imposed on
gold mining in the West, and judging by
the chairman’s remarks at the recent annual
meeting it is tempted to give up.
South Kalgurli, which is the only gold-
mine in Westralia at present paying share-
holders, has just distributed another Is. 6d.
div. Its production for the first seven months
of this year compares favorably with that
for the corresponding period of 1925, and as
the rich shoot first discovered at the 1200 ft.
level has been proved richer in depth share-
holders should continue to swell their bank-
ing accounts for a long time to come.
Brilliant Co. (W.A.) has won 2700 z. bullion
from 518 tons of ore, and will require to do
something better to justify a developmental
policy below the bottom level —380 ft. from
surface.

“Goldfish”: There will be a stampede for
tributes when applications for blocks are
called by the Horseshoe and Great Boulder.
Many stories are told of concealed rich dabs,
pockets and small veins carefully covered up
in these mines, and rumor lias it that miners
in the know are impatiently awaiting appli-
cation day. Of course, all the rich spots
were not covered; some were uncovered but
not transported to the cos.’ treatment plants.
Great sums were made by the Perseverance
tributers, but the stuff they worked will be
made to appear low-grade when the Boulder
and Horseshoe miners get their chance.

Grit keeps the flag flying at the Brisois
(Tas.). The Ringarooma River is now
tucked safely away at the back of the old
Krushka flat, and the overburden on the
Ringarooma hill is being shifted as fast as
water-power can move it. As the basalt
capping and the upper poor drifts are 300 ft.
thick it is a big job to get them out of the
way. The gutter lies far below the modern
bed of the river, and the drift in it has
been difficult to extract because of the risk
of a big slide of over-burden into the face.
Most of the year has been spent in washing
down' poor-grade drifts on the western side
of the gutter; as work went on it was found
that the long-forgotten Triangle Co. had
blocked out a seam of rich wash right- across
the gutter. From 283,000 c. yds. of drifts
treated 1871 tons of tin oxide were saved.
A good yield in December set Lindesay Clark
to work testing by cuts the worth of the
drifts. Bore sampling was done at every
sft. opened, and results ranged from 1.71 b.
oxide to 351 b. Average results went above
141 b. over depths of from 20ft. to 25ft. Re-
sults were checked by carefully measuring
the ground opened before it went to the
sluice-box for a definite clean-up. Results
were from 111 b. to 151 b. per c. yd. One
nigger in the woodpile is that over every
c. yd. of this sort of stuff is 9 c. yds. of poor
drift and 3 c. yds of over-burden. Another
is that good sampling doesn’t always wash
out in the sluice-boxes; and Lindesay Clark
is plain spoken enough to let all and sundry
know it. The cost of dead work ate up
all last year’s income from tin save £99, and
there is now a p. and L debit of £12,784.
When the balance was struck there was only
£BB5 cash in hand. Since then £18,200 of
tin has been sold, thus greasing the wheels
again. Also there is a reserve of £26,950
which would have been a lot bigger if the
London board hadn’t flirted during the war
with a colliery. The thick end of the big
job of shifting the Ringarooma hill now
looks’to be done, and if no more old Triangle
or other workings are encountered Clark
may soon be tin-winning on a fair scale.
The metal market is in his favor. He de-
serves it.
* * * *
Cock’s Pioneer, Eldorado (Vic.), which
dredges for tin and gold, has been given a
spell. The directors are asking shareholders
for £20,000 to be represented by cum. pref.
shares. The money is required to pay off
liabilities and shift the dredge up the lead
not far from payable ground worked out
long ago. They believe enough will be made
to pay off a bank overdraft of £23,356 and
carry on at a profit. Last half-year the
dredge treated 439,300 c. yd. for 23740 z. of
gold equal to 5.19 d. per cubic yard, and 30
tons of tin concentrates worth 3.04 d. per
c. yd., or a total of 8.23 d. This was in the
face of poorer ground and higher costs.
* * * *
“Hasn’t Been” : It is the height of cheek
for “Brown Coal Crank” (B. 29/7/’26) to
imply that no testing was done at Yallourn.
The opposite is the truth. The Latrobe River
runs dead up against the old open-cut about
which lie talks. As he states, the moisture
there, is 45 p.e. On the bank directly oppo-
site it goes up 20 p.c. If it is emulsion,
Altona brown coal is about as thin as the
long-talked-of oil streaks on the S. Austra-
lian and Victorian coastline. Every ton of
Altona mud would have to be hauled up a
shaft, if it could be got there, for there
is no open cut. Altona wasn’t good enough
for Bewick-Moreing when Crocker spent a pot
in getting it ready for inspection, and unless
John Bull can be persuaded to come on to
the scene it is doomed to despair. What is
carefully kept out of sight by opponents when
talking Morwell is that Sawyer, the Ameri-
can expert engaged by the Government, didn’t
spend more than a day at Morwell. To say
it was “fundamentally sound” or fundamen-
tally unsound on such an examination is at
least hazardous. In any case, Yanks don’t
mine brown coal and don’t know anything
practical about it. Germans have handled
it for half a century. The report by the
German engineer was written after weeks
of study on the field. Even if he has tried
to push the Fatherland’s dredges the com-
parative figures he gives of results from
actual work done with German brown coal
of lower grade than Morwell show convinc-
ingly that Victoria needn’t tremble because
of the malignant attacks upon Morwell.

Chairman F. A. Govett told the annual
meeting in London a lot of things about the
progress of Zinc Corp., Broken Hill. Ore
reserves showed an increase of 275,000
tons, which represented development of over
500,000 tons for the year. Nos. 9 and 10
levels alone had been responsible for adding
400,000 tons to reserves. A bore put out
from the main north drive at No. 10 level
revealed the existence of four ore occurrences.
All except the western lens contained silver
and zinc values above the average grade, and
are of similar character to the lode developed
in 1924 by the crosscut at 595 ft. north at
No. 9 level. Govett offers the opinion that
all these bodies will converge. The ore bulge
on the main lode at No. 10 level had widened
from 12ft. across at 150 ft. north to 90ft.
across at 100 ft. south, a run of 250 ft.
Finances appear bright, the mine having
showed £480,000 net profit for the year, and
investment earnings were in excess of the
fixed preferential div. “after certain appro-
priations.” In 3924 £lOO,OOO was appro-
priated for plant and development, but only
£6OOO was so expended. This year the £OOOO
was replaced, and the £lOO,OOO carried on.
Federal taxation was postponed on the sum
thus held in suspense. A preference div.
took £49,000, also a participating div. of 3s.
on preference and ordinary capital. Also a
similar ss. distribution had been effected
“since the meeting.” Reserves had £20,000
added. When the North, South and Zinc
Corp. bought the B.H.P. holding in Asso-
ciated Smelters, the Corp. increased its hold-
ing in the Smelters to 25 p.c. The £BO,OOO
thus invested would be paid out of 1926
revenues. A div. of 7 p.c. on the face value
of the Smelter shares was receivable, after
provision for adequate reserves. Subsidiary
holdings were now worth beyond £500,000,
and there was another half-million in trust
investments. Less than nothing was thus
allowed for mine value of a property which,
on the present basis of raw-metal prices,
was worth a million and a half.

The market did not receive much encour-
agement from Government Geologist Ball’s
report on Lander’s No. 3 bore at Orallo
(Q.). There were oil showings right enough,
hut Ball wasn’t carried away with enthusi-
asm. On July 19 there were considerable
showings—“due to grease.” On the follow-
ing day a large number of small, dark green
oil globules—“heavily discounted by the
fact that the swivel-head of the kelly had
been heavily oiled the previous evening.” On
July 21, at 2218 ft., appreciable showings—
“but not more than may have come from the
lubricated tools and machines on the der-
rick.” At 2228 ft. there was excitement over
a comparatively small amount of brown scum
floating on the mud fluid in the ditch. “This
was accompanied by minute spots of grease
(almost certainly from the tool joints) and
a little gas, which increased distinctly as the
bit entered the sandstone.” A month ago
sellers were asking 10s.; to-day they are
willing to quit at ss. 9d., but the best offer
is 3s. 9d.

With one dredge running, Adelong Creek
has been trying to solve the mystery of why
gold bores don’t work out in the sluice-boxes.
Next door in the Estates luck sticks to the
show, but at the Creek, if it has half a
dozen payable clean-ups, yields promptly tail
off into records which don’t cover costs. A
six months’ campaign saw 207,000 c. yds.
dredged for 9.16 d. a c. yd. Expenses took
6.64 d. This gave a net profit of £2036 after
head-office charges had been met. The co.
owes only £4OO and has £4300 in liquid stuff,
so that it can weather a storm or two.
The Shrimp tin-mine, Kangaroo Hills
(N.Q.), which treated its shareholders in-
gloriously three years back, is being worked
again, and prospects are pretty fair. Two
working faces are showing 5 p.c. and 7 p.c.
ore in a low-grade formation, but quantities
are as yet decidedly uncertain. The Towers
Tin Co. was going to treat over 1£ p.c. dirt
right through the big 40ft. formation, but
even that figure was not realised on masse.
While there is some promise in latest de-
velopments—e.g., one lode shows 18in. thick
of 5 p.c.—it will require a good deal more
work to prove that the Shrimp people threw
the mine up prematurely.

Austral Malay has accepted the Pungkah
property, 60 miles from Tongkah Harbor
(Siam). A. W. Freeman is enthusiastic in
announcing that 680 acres have been proved
pound-ground by boring, and that another
275 acres of ,61b. country to 33ft. in depth
gives the dredgable area a total content of
50,000,000yd5., sufficient to keep three high-
power dredges going for 14 years. This
accession of potential riches has lifted the
shares in the parent to the region of £5, com-
pared with 70s. a month ago.

Alluvial Tin’s twin companies, Kuala
Kampar and Taniong Tualang, are increas-
ing capital to £130,000 each by the issue of
10,000 new shares. Both have areas of 50
million cubic yards—how these tin kings
juggle with terms of millions! Malcolm
Newman estimates 20 million yards will re-
turn 11b. of black tin per cubic yard, the
remaining 30 million two-thirds per yard.
With tin at £2OO London, on the pound
ground Newman estimates profit to exceed
£6OOO a month for 11 years, with £3OOO a
month profit on the lower-grade land for an-
other 15 years: or with tin at £250 London,
£9OOO monthly on the richer ground and
£4500 monthly on the poorer, with corres-
pondingly better returns with tin at its
present price. Capital is small, and if pros-
pectus estimates are upheld another dredge
will, no doubt, be installed —50 million yards
is too large a proposition for a single dredge.
Kuala Kampar machine is timed to start
digging in October, Tanjong Tualang in
December.

Rawang Tin reports another 60 tons from
the bucket dredge for July. This realised
£10,266. It cost £1983 to mine, leaving a
profit of £8283 from this unit. Rawang was
the first to instal a dredge with jigs and
classifiers. The good work these have done is
shown in the fact that they have saved no
less than 309 tons of tin since the beginning
of this year.

Malcolm Newman is off to Malaya to
supervise the boring of the Kampar 'River
show. Kampar River and the Winchester
Trust, Ltd., London, were in the middle of
an expensive suit in equity which had all
the marks of outlasting Jarndyce v. Jarn-
dyce. The battle was over the £87,000 sale
contract arranged last year, the tin content
of the area being the reason for the rough-
up. Both litigants have now agreed to accept
Alluvial Tin’s valuation as definite, and that
is to be Newman’s job.

genius, morals and sex would be chemically-controlled. Further, he asserted, instead of prolonging old age, science would bring about the prolongation of youth."

“Doodlebug” : Two visitors from tlie land
of movies, waffles and hootch, a man and a
woman, descended the - other day on a subur-
ban private hospital in Melbourne, where a
young lady of no importance had just become
the possessor of a lusty little Australian boy.
THIS AGE OF WONDERS.
JACK : “D’you know who that sweet kid is that Eve
keen dancing with all night—the one with a
henna bob?”
JILL : “Oh yeah; that’s Mum.”
They were in a motor-cycle hurry to adopt
a baby, and after promising to let the
mother see the little chap now and then, the
tourists paid the hospital bill, settled for the
doctor and hastened away. The couple left
with the child next day for Sydney, where the
woman entered a maternity home. *lt is
alleged that when the infant reaches the
land of hope and glory before Christmas he
will be heir to one million dollars!
“Windsor”: Is there any test by which
one can find for certain whether a man is
shot? A doctor, giving evidence in favor
of one charged at Melbourne with drunken-
ness while driving a motor-car, said prisoner
had passed several well-known tests at the
clink wittf flying colors. He had been able
to pronounce “Irish Constabulary” and
“British Constitution,” and had successfully
touched the end of his nose —“an almost
infallible test.” The John Hop on point
duty declared that the motorist, who had
driven against his traffic signal and nar-
rowly avoided a collision, smelt of drink.
That didn’t seem to impress the Bench ; but
when John added that the accused on the
way to the cooler had affectionately placed
his arm round the Law’s neck and asked it
to let him off, promising to put a couple of
quid on a horse in its favor, the Bench
promptly disregarded the prisoner’s pronun-
ciation and ability to touch the end of his
nose, and firmly relieved him of his license
and £3O.
* * * *
“Horatio”: A traveller lately arrived in
Brisbane, to be promptly halted by. two
detectives, who showed a lively curiosity
about the contents of the small black bag
he was carrying. With a shrug of liis shoulders
he opened it, to disclose 20 tins of what
looked remarkably like opium. The traveller
had no doubt about it —urged to make a
clean breast of it, he admitted that he had
paid £8 a tin for the contrabrand, and was
taking it northward. It was the Govern-
ment Analyst who exonerated him from
attempted lawbreaking by pronouncing the
stuff to be merely molasses. The suspect
was so wild at the conviction that he had
been taken down for £IGO that he showed
no gratitude whatever at the assurance that
there would be no attempt to secure any
other sort of conviction against him.
* * * *
“Hasen”: you must admire resourceful-
ness, wherever and whenever you find it. In
a recent raid on a two-up school, Melbourne
police rounded up 155, all of whom duly
appeared and, with the exception of four,
were ordered to pay sums varying from £lO
(or four weeks) to £2 (or two weeks). Most
of the fines were paid immediately, but in a
few cases the cash was not forthcoming, and
14 unlucky ones were returned to languish in
the cells. Before the day’s business was
ended the number of languishers was reduced
to a dozen. One had been redeemed by a
relative with the necessary money, but the
other had raised the wind without outside
help—he had started a game of two-up in the
cell, and won enough to pay his fine.

“The Rumpus”: Add house-chimneys and
stoves to the list of inanimate things that
get “tired” (B. 8/7/’26). Any cook will
tell you that a chimney which has been with-
out cooking-fire smoke for a long period hates
to start business again, and a stove after a
spell will not cook properly until
it really feels its fire once more.

mas holidays -we engaged , a
Chinese cook to cope with the
rush of sweltering visitors to
our seaside pub. One year a
new yellow-face blew along, and
on the day of his arrival said
to my Dad: “Me welly solly,
Boss, me cookin’ welly bad
firstee day. But you waitee.
To-moller stove findee out all
about me; then beauliful cook-
ing.” And so it was.

“Havana Harbor”: Our
young friend Tondeleyo, of
“White Cargo,” seems to be get-
ting on the nerves of a lot of
people besides “Feng-Shui” and
his polemical friends (B.
22/7/’26). At the conference
of the National Council of
Women in Brisbane a Victorian
delegate referred bitterly to the
encouragement of the hussy in the
French New Hebrides. Indeed,
the good lady went so far as
to move that the Federal Prime
Minister be requested to inform
the forthcoming Imperial Con-
ference that there is “a very
lax moral code in regard to New
Hebridean native women under
French control.” The matter
seems worthy of attention, and
if Stanley Baldwin’s duties pre-
vents his immediate departure
for the New Hebrides, he should
have no trouble in finding can-
didates for seats on a Royal
Commission.
“Rotom”: That the proposal to provide
Sydney school children with milk has gen-
erally fallen flat may be mainly attributed
to the opposition or indifference of the
teachers. But in a part of the Western
Suburbs a mere milkcarter, Albert Thomp-
son, has shown what can be done by enthusi-
asm and hard work. Last October he com-
menced a school delivery for the western
branch of the Dairy Farmers’ Co. He shut
down on the insanitary system of supplying
the juice in open buckets to be dipped from
TWO OF A KIND.
“Darling, you are the most beautiful woman hi the world.”
“Oh, Harold, how quick you arc at noticing things!”
by the pupils, and he overcame the teachers'
opposition by doing all the work himself.
The milk lias been supplied in corked bottles,
each furnished with a drinking-straw. On
every school day Thompson delivers to vari-
ous schools before the lunch-hour, and the
empties are collected and cleansed in the
afternoon. One penny per bottle is paid by
the pupils, and all accounts are kept by the
supplier. The teachers are required only
to supervise the distribution. Already they
own up that the supply is beneficial to the
children, both physically and mentally. From
100 children supplied with a daily pint of
pasteurised milk in October the juvenile con-

HOLLY: “How do you know Horace is really in love with you?”
MOLLY : “He's brought me home in a taxi time after time, and never once looked at the
meter.”
sumers have now increased to 2000. And
that has brought the job to the limit that
Thompson can hit off his own cart.
* * * *
“Mephisto”: A few nights ago in one of
Brisbane’s main streets a motorist speeded
up too much and ran into the car in front.
The front wheels of the back car and the
rear wheels of the front one were in such
perfect alignment that the second car
climbed up the wheels of the first until it
was standing up at an angle of about 45
degrees. Then it capsized, and parts were
smashed. The front car was in no way
damaged, and the driver of the second car
escaped with a small cut from a broken
windscreen.
“Clerk”: A remarkably cool cracksman
blundered on to a burglar-alarm after breaking
into a fashionable frock-shop on the Mel-
bourne Block the
other night, and
the annoying alert-
ness of the police
motor-patrol gave
him no chance of
escaping before the
Johns tramped in
through the forced
door. The ’tec in
charge led the
chase up to the
first floor, and after
a fruitless search
for the electric-light
switch th e pur-
suers began to
hunt with lighted
matches in a jungle
of costumiere’s
m o d els and
hanging m asses
of lingerie. They
were just begin-
ning to scratch
their heads and
venture the opinion
that the cove must
have got away,
when one of them
groped amidst a
row of frocks along
the wall. He touched
something which
immediately sway-
ed backwards and
forwards like a
stiff wax figure.
The bluff nearly
worked, but the
’tec suddenly be-
cain e suspicious,
and grabbed the
swaying form
firmly. Then the
wax model emerged
as a bootless
cracksman under-
taking philosophi-
cally to “go quiet.”
“A.W.”: The
poor little Speck is always getting jolted.
The Commonwealth liner Largs Bay was
lately ploughing her way past Rottnest
Island, the holiday resort just _ out-
side Fremantle, when one of the immi-
grant passengers walked up to an officer.
What he wanted to know was: “Is this Tas-
mania we are passing?”
* * * *
“Borom” : There is a lot of difference be-
tween N.S.W. prisons, and, generally speak-
ing. the question as to which a convicted man
will patronise depends on the number of his
previous convictions. A crook who knows
the ropes will often move Heaven and
earth to be allowed to serve his time in one
particular gaol or to avoid being sent to an-
other. Long Bay is the most popular, largely
because of its closeness to Sydney and the
possibility of obtaining underworld news and
the contrabrand which helps to relieve the
rigors of a “stretch”; and there are other
alleviations —entertainments, etc. Goulburn
comes next in favor; the inmates are allowed
certain privileges not procurable in the other
gaols, and the discipline is less severe.
Bathurst is regarded with distinct hostility,
and nowadays Parramatta, chiefly reserved
for long-sentence men with former convic-
tions, is looked upon as the worst of the lot.

THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
June was the month of roses
When Harry reigned as king
Where the moist summer closes
The pageant of bleak spring.
There scarce a bloom could linger
Till August filled the land
And with a warm wet finger
W'rote harvest brown and bland.
But here, where sunbeams splinter
To rainbows through the trees,
The calendar marks winter
And coldly sighs the breeze;
Yet ere the dead year closes
His still unwearied eye,
June is a month of roses,
All budding for July.
October from September
Takes up the scented wreath.
November and December
Flame gold and red beneath
The high sun’s merry laughter;
And February’s fire
Tosses to March and after
The blossoms of desire.
But June, chill June, forgetting
Its legend of dead days,
Spends all its heart in setting
The garden beds ablaze;
And with an eager hinting
Of some fair thing it knows
Gives a more lavish tinting
To every waking rose.
The frost comes keen and biting,
The almond trees are bare,
The last gold leaf is lighting
The candles of despair;
But winter’s a late comer
And moves on feeble wing
Where the last rose of summer
Is the first rose of spring !

“Wang” : Our rather sleepy Melbourne sub-
urb was startled the other morning by the
news that burglars had entered a local dress-
making and millinery establishment on the pre-
vious night and got away with the stock. When
a little later word went round that a woman’s
body had been found at the rear of a build-
ing which is in course of demolition and re-
construction close to the looted shop, and
that murder was suspected, excitement
reached fever-heat. I was at the police-
station when a wild-eyed boy rushed in with
the first information and volunteered to
direct the Johns to the body. Two of them
HOW WE DANCE THE CHARLESTON.
left with him, and I attached myself to the
party. Our guide led us to the rear of the
building, and after clambering over masses of
material he pointed to a sheltered spot with
a “Look, there she is,” and bolted. We
looked, and saw sticking out from beneath
the masonry a pair of legs encased in silk
stockings. Apparently the owner of them
was lying on her back under the debris.
When we got closer highly explosive language
rent the air. The legs were dummy ones
looted from the shop that had been robbed ;
the thieves, who evidently had ideas of
humor, had planted them where we had
found them.
“A. Borig” : Truth whops fiction, and no-
body knows it now better than the motor-
driver from Kangaroo Valley (N.8.W.) who
collided with a house in the middle of the
night in Bong Bong-street, Bowral. Imagine
a man driving 26 miles through mountain,
mud and scrub and arriving at a well-
lighted fashionable town like Bowral, and
there, in the centre of the main street, find-
ing a house! He thought he was seeing
things, and there was only one way to put
his roving vision in its proper place, and
that was to have ago at it. Which he did
TACT.
DORA: “Dr. Browne is watching you, darling.”
DAISY: “Pooh, let him —I don’t care for the man. Why, when I consulted him he asked
me to put out my tongue, and he never even glanced at it.”
DORA: “Maybe he just wanted time to write a prescription.”
—to his sorrow. It was a house all right,
and a motor-car wouldn’t shift it. A team
of bullocks did, I presume, as it is not there
now.
* # * *
“Flagwagger”: I wonder how many
romances could be traced to the 1915 Christ-
mas billies. We had returned to Egypt
from Gallipoli, and were camped at Tel-el
Ivebir when the gifts overtook our com-
pany in January, 1916. They were a prize
lot, mine a beaut. I naturally wrote, thank-
ing the Tasmanian girl whose name was in
it, and the correspondence has continued
ever since. The only reason why we have
never met to see if we measure up to imag-
ined standards is that my billy-girl mar-
ried another Digger before my return.
* * * *
“Simon”: There are other senses beside
that of hearing uncannily developed in Syd-
ney’s “Blind Freddy” (B. 22/7/’26) —by the
way, he is not only blind but eyeless. For
a time he was employed to “watch” a stall
at Paddy’s Market, and the light-fingered in-
voluntarily drew back when Blind Freddy
turned on them. He can unerringly tell a
white comb from a black comb the moment
his hand touches it. Likewise he can tell
a white handkerchief from a spotted or
colored one. Some years ago he was in the
habit of calling every afternoon at a ware-
house where I was employed. He would
leave the tram a hundred yards away and
make a bee-line for the front doorway. One
day there was a newly-dug hole right in
front awaiting the insertion of a telephone-
post. Many people watched Freddy’s pro-
gress from the tram. Some said he had
the gift of second sight, and when he came
to the chasm he’d just naturally jump across
it. But he didn’t. He fell into it. As they
hauled him out he said, “The blanker that
would dig a hole like that without putting
up a notice ought to be shot.”
* * * *
“Bill Bowyang” : The most persistent trier
I met in war-time was a Digger who wished
to secure his discharge at Cairo in 1918.
He was a middle-aged Light Horseman, who
had been arguing the point with
Abdul since the early days on
Gallipoli, and reckoned he had
done his bit; but the medical
officers thought otherwise —vet-
erans were badly wanted to
steady the youthful reinforce-
ments. In bygone days the
14th A.G.H. was General Gor-
don’s barracks, but when the
premises were taken over by the
A.I.F. in 1916 the soldiers’
quarters were turned into medi-
cal wards. These wards looked
down on a large paved square.
One morning tlie Light Horse-
man took up his position at one
corner of the square, and pro-
ceeded to give us, in a rasping
voice, “Life’s Dream Is O’er.”
When he had finished the song
he marched to each of the other
corners and repeated the per-
formance to a grinning audi-
ence of sick and wounded Dig-
gers. The item was staged
every morning for two months;
at that point the medical offi-
cers reckoned it was another in-
stance of a good soldier gone
in the head, and he was returned
to Australia. He is now grow-
ing tomatoes in a N.Q. coastal
district, and mention of “Life’s
Dream Is O’er” brings a grin
to his wrinkled face.
“Leamington”: The hilarity with which
the Sydney R.S.L. received the Defence
Department’s complaint that the unclaimed
guns allotted to the League were rusting
away and “spoiling the beauty of the Pad-
dington Barracks interior,” recalls a simi-
lar incident in 1908 when an old-fashioned
muzzle-loading cannon was 1 ' charged with
having a similar effect on the same land-
scape. All efforts to dispose of it failed;
no outsiders would have it as a gift, and
heroic measures to wish it on another organi-
sation proved a failure. Then some genius
ordered its burial, and a large fatigue party
performed the dark deed just inside the main
Oxford-street entrance. If the decision to
sell 120 ft. of the military frontage on the
same thoroughfare is adhered to, some
builder on that spot is going to have trouble
with his foundations, for the ancient death-
dealer weighed 18 tons.
* * * *
“A.G.M.” (Milan) : Jack London described
Sydney as the noisiest city he knew. De-
spite the protests of doctors and others, it
still preserves the irritating anachronism of
the chimes on the Post Office clock. And
even in the choicest residential areas, raucous
roosters, yelping dogs and vulgarly rowdy
guests still make reasonable rest at night
uncertain always and often impossible. Even
along the gay Riviera night disturbances are
not accepted with the same complacency as
in Sydney. As part of a combined effort to
secure proper rest along the Cote d’Azur, the
hotel proprietors have had fixed in each bed-
room, corridor, reception-room and lift an
artistically-designed card centred by a clock
dial showing the hours between 10 p.m. and
8 a.m. printed in deep shadow. Above these
darkened hours the word “Silence” is very
prominently placed and the warning finger of
a grave figure points directly towards a tablet
of advice:—
Respect the Repose of your Neighbor.
Do not Slam the Doors.
Make no Unnecessary Noise.
In London no one is allowed even to whistle
for a cab after 10 p.m., and in most cities
efforts are being made to lessen night noises
which are said to be largely responsible for
the prevalence of neurasthenia.
“Chancery Lane”: Typists’ errors'? A
flapper in my office, typing from a pencilled
draft, recently addressed both letter and en-
velope to “The Mangy Director” of a Mel-
bourne public company.
* * * *
“Modestine”: If the suicide symposium
hasn’t finished, here is one that combines
originality and unexpected responsiveness to
the sort of helpfulness that is meant to
hinder. Jim and Tom were brothers, and
farmers in North Auckland. Jim had a wife
and a cheerful disposition. Tom possessed
neither, and got his own way on the farm
by continually threatening self-destruction
whenever anyone opposed him. He threat-
ened it so often that it became a family
joke to suggest expeditious ways in which
he might carry out his fell purpose. One
morning when he had been particularly try-
ing, Mrs. Jim sarcastically observed, “Why
don’t you bury yourself in the old well?
Jump in and drag down enough dirt to cover
yourself as you go.” Tom didn’t appear
at dinner, and when he failed to turn up to
tea search was made for him. Presently
they came to the old well, and there was
THE BIGGER FEELING.
HE : “You can't love me, or you wouldn’t mind living
in this small flat.”
SHE : “Oh, I do love you, hut not on such a small
scale.”
the farm tip-dray with the tailboard down.
A light was lowered, and revealed that a
fresh load of sand and stones had been de-
posited in the hole. Tom was underneath.
He had brought the load to the well, attached
a rope to the tail, jumped in, and pulled
the stuff on top of him.
* * * *
“Light Horse”: No Australian who has
met the Bedouin on his native heath will be
astonished at the wanton shot from an
Arab gun which slew Cobham’s mechanic,
Elliott. The Bedouin, whether of Sinai or
the Marshes, is as treacherous as he is
cowardly and lazy. He took his quota of
every unit in Palestine by shots from
ambush, or by cold-blooded murder of the
wounded. He began digging up buried
Australians for their boots, but he was too
lazy to persevere when he found that a
few had their leathers removed before burial.
The Bedouin, of the Marshes is reputed even
worse than his brother of the Sands. And
living as he does in interminable reed beds,
in reed villages built upon vast floating reed
platforms, he is even more difficult to lay
hands on.
THE WAY OUT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Wilhelmine Ottoline Gustavine Cornelie Blank
petitioned for a divorce from Jan Pieter de Vries
Blank on the ground of desertion. There was no
appearance on behalf of respondent, and a decree
nisi, returnable in six months, was granted.”
The lottery that men call matrimony
Seems specially designed for our confusion.
Whether the stake be love or milk and honey,
As like as not the prize is disillusion.
No matter how we strive to make the best
Out of the situation, o’er the scene
Fate casts a damper, with an acid zest,
As she has done, in her despite, to winsome Wilhel-
mine.
Yet all must share the risk and take their chances
Of drawing from the bag a winning ticket;
The desperate uncertainty enhances
The pleasures of the game of trying to pick it.
But Luck, indifferent, never cares at all
Whether one wears the title of a Queen
Or something that may mistily recall
A toothpaste ad., a hair-restoring stunt, like
“Ottoline.”
Natheless, we plunge into the void unheeding
Advice from friends and clamorous relations,
Who, singed themselves, unite in piteous pleading
That fills the atmosphere with lamentation?.
We spurn them, as they hold the mirror up,
Or vainly strive to draw aside the screen,
And show us that we’re being sold a pup—
Such sentiments impelled, no doubt, the grieving
Gustavine.
Still, there’s a full stop e’en to dire disaster.
The meanest worm his turning has, they say.
It’s safe to lay a quid to a piastre
That somehow we can wangle out a way
To best the stars against us in their courses,
Provided we can raise enough to fee
The lawyers, lurking where the glad divorce is,
And, from our fetters freed, fare forth again—-
like Cornelie.

. Ross Smith had the difficulties of the
pioneer, of course, but the speed of Cobham’s
approach to Australia shows that flight has
been wonderfully speeded up. Cobhain was
in the sixth day of his flight and on the last
stage to Bushire when the bullet which
killed Elliott checked his progress. Ross
Smith flew over that place on the twelfth
day out. Ross Smith reached Rangoon on
his 19tli day of flying, and it took Cobliam
nine flying days—he lost seven days at Basra
after Elliott’s death and four more at
Bandar Abbas through heavy monsoon
weather —to reach the same point. Cobham
actually got to Delhi, which is the half-way
house to Australia, in 11 flying days.

While the debate in Vic. Assembly on the
resolutions protesting against the abolition
of per capita payments was proceeding, Alec
Peacock made incidental reference to the
work of the Federal Convention, of which
he was a member, and of the last sitting in
Melbourne in 1898. He looked around, as
if seeking members of the House who could,
from personal recollection, bear out what
he had said. But what a scatter there has
been in 28 years! He could discover only
Speaker Bowser, Lands Minister Downward
and Dick Toutcher, while shuffling across the
hall beyond was Sternberg, of the Plush
Chamber —five (including Peacock) out of
the 143 who made up the two State Houses
in 1898.
The memory of Edward Wollstonecraft,
its first chairman, is being honored in connec-
tion with the centenary of the Sydney Cham-
ber of Commerce, which started its activity
in July, 1826. He was a partner of Alex-
ander Berry. Both secured large grants of
land on the north side of the harbor, and their
nam-'s are perpetuated in the district. Syd-
ney nad a population of 10,000 Avhen the little
gathering of merchants, who were also
mainly pastoralists and agriculturists, decided
to ask Governor Darling to recognise the
newly-formed Chamber. Darling sent his
blessing the same day, but it was 25 years
before the Chamber began to take itself
seriously, and its history up to 1852 is rather
misty.
George Lambert’s portrait of George
Judah Cohen, which many artists considered
should have won the Archibald prize, did
not rest long on his hands. The Commer-
cial Bank honored its chairman by placing
the picture in its principal banking chamber.
One of the bank’s earliest big customers was
Sam Cohen, the father of George Judah,
who gave it also the business of David
Cohen and Co., of which George Judah is
now the chief. The firm acted as gold
buyers for the bank when its branch offices
had not reached farther north than Maitland.
Arthur Tonge, who may get into Parlia-
ment as a result of the political operation
which puts Kay into a £l5OO p.a. job on the
Meat Board, has been a persistent trier for
political honors in North Sydney—before
composite electorates came he attempted to
win St. Leonards. He has been an organ-
iser for the Clerical Association; he was a
member of that organisation in its infancy
when it was the Clerks’ Union and was hav-
ing a hai’d fight for existence. At that time
he was a clerk in the Evening News office,
and he was one of a committee of newspaper
clerks which secured the first agreement —
outside one secured by the shipping clerks,
who had the Wharf Laborers behind them —
for the regulation of clerical wages in N. S.
Wales.
The Huddart Parker Co. last week gath-
ered its managers from all its branch offices
for a celebration in Melbourne. The com-
pany started business on August 1, 1876, and
the jubilee was fittingly honored. The whole
Huddart-Parker fleet, when it first got
going, crawled under sail. Crawled is right
—it took one ship 34 days to get from New-
castle to Melbourne.
When Australian Art was an infant “Old
Dap” guided its tottering steps and smiled
indulgently w r hen it strayed. A. J. Daplyn
was 40 when, 42 years ago, he arrived in
Australia and settled down to the job of
instructor to the Royal Art Society classes,
which he supervised for 15 years. In his
younger days he was a friend of R. L.
Stevenson, and among his pupils was Syd-
ney Long. A substantial legacy took him
to England, but he returned again, and only
went back to live in Chelsea two years ago.
Death found him there.
Headmasters who put an unmistakable
imprint on generation after generation of
youngsters don’t grow on every bush. Christ-
church (M.L.) lost the best it ever had when
“Balbus” Bevan-Brown, having had three
years out of harness, laid down his life. His
big chance came wffien, not yet 30, he was
brought from Manchester to take charge of
the Christchurch Boys’ High School. He
held the job for 40 years, and moulded a
great school in the process. He never forgot
liis boys, and those of them who took part
in the Big Scrap were sure of at least one
faithful correspondent: and always there was
a little piece of the school ribbon —black and
blue —as a gentle reminder that the old
school regarded the recipient as a represen-
tative. He abhorred cramming, and had
very little love for competitive examinations,
regarding a school as primarily a place in
which to prepare youngsters for life.
Amongst those who attended Gipsy Smith’s
Sydney Hippodrome meeting for returned
soldiers was a Christian Israelite. Believing
his services were wanted in the big affair,
the long-haired religionist lined up one day
with other recruits, and when his turn came
was told that his hair would have to go if he
wanted to be a soldier. He walked sorrow-
fully away, ignoring the gibes of the profane
recruits; but he went no further than the
nearest barber’s shop, from which he shortly
returned shaven and shorn. He may be
ranked amongst the men wffio made big
sacrifices in order to serve.
A Geelong girl, Nesta McKellar, aged 20,
with her mother, has just motored to and
from Darwin in 57 days. The pilgrimage
was an almost impromptu affair.
The wholesale fruit and vegetable business,
and keeping the growing of these things out
of the hands of Chinamen, was the life
work of William Charlick, just dead in
Adelaide at 68. He was largely the means
of duplicating the market on East-terrace,
which catches most of the market gardeners
coming in from the Torrens valley or down
from the hills, and he was chairman of direc-
tors of a “fruit and produce exchange co.”
Owen Dixon, who accepted an acting-
Supreme Court Judgeship in Vic. the other
day, and will be free again at the end of
the year, is said to have his eye on the High
Court Bench. As Higgins is 75, Duffy 74,
Powers 73 and Isaacs 71, he has more than
a fighting chance before he is 45. He is now
onlj 40.
SUPREME SALESMANSHIP.
“Is your son growing up mit a good business
head ?”
“A good buisness head! My, dot boy could
buy every stitch of clothes a gustomer
haf got an’ den sell him a suitcase.”
Aii almost-forgotten pastoralist died lately
in Adelaide after many years of ill health.
F. R. Hamilton was very well known in
the West Darling district of N.S.W. at one
time. He was manager of Mount Gipps for
20 years—that was the job George McCul-
loch had when Broken Hill was unearthed
on that run.
The oldest tug in Sydney Harbor and the
oldest yacht still in commission met last
week in Berry’s Bay. The tug was the
Egeria, built in, 1874 by W. M. Ford,
father of the present owner of the boat-
building yards there, and the yacht, was the
Sirocco, built by the same man in 1882.
He is still well and happy at the age of
82. Foi’d, senior, had his first shipbuilding-
yards at old Circular Quay where the China
steamei’s used to bei'tli. When one of these
bi-ought the first small-pox scare to Sydney,
he was commissioned to build the quarantine
station at North Head. A condition of the
contract was that all the timber had to be
towed from the yards to the station, in
order to sterilise it against contagion.
Another monument to the old shipbuilder is
the flagpole at South Head, which he erected
many years ago.
“R.B.’s” tribute:—
The death of Harry Coyne, while Queensland Land
Court Judge, removed by accident a man who
should have lived to 90. His great vitality enabled
him to survive shocking head injuries for a week.
For seven days after a motor accident had practically
pulped the frontal bone his heart beat strongly.
At his funeral the real oration was pronounced by
an old Westerner in the crowd. “There’s the last
of a good mate and a white man,” said the Westerner.
I had known him nine years or so, and never knew or
heard of an unkindly action of his. He should
have died hereafter —one of the real Australian
back-country men, with the ready smile of the
healthy boy and the strong heart of youth that never
tires.
Just dead David James always claimed that
he put the fh-st pick into the Broken Hill
lode, but admitted that Charles Rasp was
the first to realise the mineral value of the
Barrier Range. James, who hailed from
Wales, was a fencing-contractor and well-
sinker before he was able to retire on the
proceeds of his spec, in an original Broken
Hill syndicate share.
Another Australian to capture a big
American university job is Dr. H. Kingsley
Ward, son of the dear old “Whiskers” who
bas occupied editorial chairs in Melbourne,
Sydney and Brisbane. Kingsley Ward be-
comes faculty instructor in the department
of bacteriology and immunology at Harvard.
He went from Sydney Uni. as Rhodes
Scholar, to eventually become one of the
Oxford staff on the Brittish Medical Re-
search Council. His war service dated from
1914.
Brisbane has a linguist of wider range
than most in George Zuckschweerdt, an
Esthonian, who was called on to act as
interpreter for a fellow-countryman in a
recent police-court case. Prior to the war
he was a master at the Petrograd Normal
School. After several arguments with Bol-
shevism he migrated to Queensland, and
found casual employment as interpreter to
the Customs and State Insurance offices, and
for a time was assistant-lecturer in math-
ematics at the Ipswich Christian Brothers
College. He speaks English, French, Ger-
man, Esthonian, Polish and a few more
tongues, and between them he has got a
job driving a yellow cab.
T. Iv. Sidey, of Dunedin, who has been
representing his native city in the Maoriland
Parliament for the last quarter of a cen-
tury, has spent a good deal of his time
in the House trying to induce the country
to put its clocks back an hour in the summer
time and enjoy an hour of sunshine that
otherwise would be spent abed. It has
taken 25 years to make the cockies see that,
though they will get up an hour earlier
in the summer, they will go to bed an hour
earlier the night before. The bill has now
got through the Lower House, but most
probably will be thrown out by the Lords—
largely squattocrats, who believe that they
made Maoriland and resent any implication
that it isn’t a perfect job.
Frank Edwards, who, as secretary of the
Chamber of Manufactures, is largely respon-
sible for the inquiry into N.S.W. railway
tenders, has had plenty of limelight. When
he was appointed secretary of the Millions
Club (in between that and his present job
he was secretary of the Motorists’ Associa-
tion) the R.S.L., claiming that a returned
man should have been given the job, made the
appointment a test case, and lost. But he
was at the Front —as private secretary to
Holman, when that gentleman visited the
trenches. Edwards started life as a boy in
Holman’s office, and Holman, whose loyalty
to his friends is splendid, always looked
after him.
Blackburn, a Labor lawyer, voiced in Vic.
Assembly an objection which had already
been raised in the Cabinet before H. C. G.
Macindoo had been lifted from Crown Prose-
cutor to County Court Judge. Theirs
was a bad training for the job, he
urged, and declared that previous appoint-
ments of the same kind had not been a
success. Eggleston cited Chomley as one of
the best Judges the Court had known,
although he had been a C.P.; and he might
have added that it was almost the exception
for a N.S.W. District Court Judge to be
drawn from anywhere else than the ranks
of C.P.’s. In any case, there was an im-
plied promise to Macindoe that lie would not
be debarred from further promotion by taking
the C.P.-ship. He had a hand in the Big
Scrap.
O. R. SNOWBALL, whose amendment to
the Address-in-Reply hostile to “the pro-
posed agreement with the Common-
wealth Government in connection with
the construction of roads,” has been the
Vic. political sensation of the week.
The Chidleyites do not propose to let the
memory of the apostle of semi-nudity fade;
a life of the prophet is* being prepared. It
will be a frank document, in its way, admit-
ting, for instance, that Chidley stood his
trial in Adelaide for manslaughter following
the death of a man in a fray. The compila-
tion is in the hands of a Sydney character,
a product of Trinity, Cambridge, who roomed
and chummed with Lord Mountbatten, rowed
in the Cambridge eight—-and now sells
papers in the streets. His introduction to
Australia was as a university lecturer, but
he was soon fired for his anarchistic doc-
trines.
Mullineux, the clerical Rugbyite who cap-
tained a British team which visited Austral-
asia, is organiser of a “pilgrimage” to Gal-
lipoli, Salonika and other spots where war
graves are congregated. The pilgrims intend
to do any work that may be required in
connection with these far-flung cemeteries.
A BALLADE OF CREDIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Paris business men, wholesale and retail alike,
are taking long holidays, explaining: ‘My goods are
my gold reserve. I shall not sell until I know the
price at which I can replenish my stock, so am
putting up the shutters.’ "—Cable.
The vaunting braggart casts his wolds
In lavish style about,
And, as he hopes, unthinking herds
Assess him by his shout;
Yet when the test of skill and nerve
Arrives, it will be found,
“The goods’’ are still the gold reserve
That makes man’s credit sound.
Our printed promises to pay
About the land we strew;
Our solvency we thus display—
Aye, and our affluence too.
Micawbers in our politics
Fling lOUs around,
But ’tis “the goods” their value fix
And keep our p.n.’s sound.
Not paper moneys only flow
At statesmen’s beck and call;
Our very laws are apt to show
The paper prodigal.
The easy-written Act may seem
To cast rich gifts around—
Without “the goods” to back the dream
It is but empty sound.
Mere words pro tern, may sway and swerve,
Cheap promises abound;
“The goods” remain the gold reserve
To keep our credit sound.
N.S.W.

“The Deacon”; If “Ajax” (B. 8/7/’26)
will come out to the Western Suburbs (Sydney) I
undertake to show him a Chinese who can whistle.
He does it spontaneously when he has his usual
issue of som suey under his belt, his favorite melody
being Chinese opera. But in a fairly varied career
I have heard only this one Chinese whistler and
only one Chinese “singing drunk.” The latter was a
vegetable John with his baskets, doing the lock-
stitch up a suburban street, and the noise he made
was like a cross between a tram bell and a rooster
crowing. As he caught sight of my eye, and
perhaps my cloth, he pulled up, and w'hile himself
and the garden truck swayed precariously, joyously
gurgled “Too muehee Too-hee.”
* * * *
“Valimanbag”: Concerning the abo. who
stood on red-hot ashes for several minutes without
feeling them, I can go
one better. Travelling
from a Gulf-countrv
station to Laura (Q.)
m y horse became
tenderfooted, so I de-
cided to have him shod
at the next- homestead
I came to. There the
station blacksmith, a
Binghi, was commis-
sioned to fix him up.
I was astounded to see
the smith hold a
white-hot shoe in his
naked hand while he
hammered it into
shape. Sensing a purse
to be filled by him as
a side-draw at the
Cooktown show to be
held a few weeks later,
I got permission to
take him with me. As
the train came into
sight round a corner
while -we were waiting
on the platform at
Laura, Binghi gave a
yell—“ Gripes, look out,
boss, he bin get us!”
-—and fled for his life.
Months later I learned
that he had turned up
at the station, having-
run and walked the 50-
odd miles from Laura,
with the yarn, “Plurry debil-debil on fire bin chase
us—bin catch boss, I tink.”
“Emel” : How’s this for the championship?
Mr. McCredden, of Mitre Lake (Vic.), this year lost
a 17-year old cow which had been milked continu-
ously from the time when, at two years of age, she
gave birth to her first and only calf, until her death.
The flow varied with the seasons, but each spring she
came into full milk.
* * * *
“Wongarbon”: Until recently I believed
in the bush theory that
native.and Italian bees
were antagonistic and
never found in the
same locality. In a
tree at Wyndham,
South Coast (N.S.W.),
there was a nest of the
Italians about 20ft.
from the ground, and
only 2ft. below that a
nest of the natives.
After the tree had been
cut down it was seen
that both colonies
used the same entrance,
a dry limb midway
between the two nests.
The Italians turned up
the trunk after enter-
ing, while the natives
went down it. There
was a good supply of
honey in each home,
but of entirely differ-
ent quality. When
their nests were rifled,
the natives swarmed
all over the robbers,
but the Italians did
the stinging. Both
swarms were placed in
boxes and taken home.
The Italians immedi-
ately settled to work,
but the natives refused
to stay, proving once
again that they will
not work in captivity.
“W.A.D.”: I started an oyster-farm last
year in Boambee Creek, North Coast (N.S.W.), and
left some of the bivalves in a shallow pool for the
night. In the morning I was disgusted to find all
the shells open and their contents removed. This
was repeated next night on another lot, so on the
following evening I sat up on guard with my gun.
No one came, but still the oysters went. Next night
I settled down by the side of the pool and caught
three of the largest crabs ever born. They were
cheerfully opening the shells with their nippers, and
seemed not to have the slightest trouble in doing so.
“Jimmy Possum”: “Did ever I tell yous
about that ole-man kangaroo on Duck Crick?” Harry
the Liar asked, as we sat yarning after tea. “He
wus a marvel that chap. He must ha’ bin near a
thousand years old, an’ hadn’t a hair on him except
a straggler over one eye. No one ever seed him
hop, except me ole man when he wus a boy, an’
then only once —me ole man’s horse bolted, an’ th’
hopper had ter shift himself, or he’d ha’ bin run
over. Well, he got so ole at last he couldn’t crawl
about ter get a feed, an’ when he had ate his patch
NO GOOD AT RISHMETIC.
POLICEMAN: “How many times is this I’ve arrested you?”
PRISONER: “Don’t — hie —ask me. I thought you were keepin’
th’ score.”
off he had ter lie down an’ wait till it growed
up agen. Us boys used ter pull him a bit uv grass
now an’ a gen; but th’ ole boy seemed too proud ter
touch it. Before we left home ter go out west, me
an’ another bloke that pitied the ole boy carried
him on ter a good patch uv grass an’ left him there.
Uv course, he could only get a drink when
it rained, but he never seemed ter be troubled
with thirst. We wus away 20 years, an’ th’ first
thing we done when we got back —it wus in 1902, in
th’ middle uv th’ drouth —was ter ask about th’ kan-
garoo. ‘He’s still in th’ same place,’ me old man
told us. We went out ter have a look at him
nex’ day. Th’ poor ole devil wus lyin’ there all
shrivelled up, an’ we thought he’d been dead for
years. But when we turned ter go away we noticed
him move. We rolled him over an’ had a look at
him. He wus still alive. I don’t believe he could
ha’ died, not if he lived a million years. He'd left
things too long, an’ had got that weak he hadn’t
th’ strength ter draw his last breath. We had ter
put him out uv his misery.”
* * * *
“M.G.” : “Ye may talk about yer Sandows
and yer Pagels, but for sheer strength,” said old
Fagan, “I nivver knew the aquil o’ Con O’Hara.
Av coorse ye’ve all heard of the night he fought
the three Maloneys at the Flying Pig whin Long-
Jack come at him wid a pick-handle and the other
two wid palin’s. Wid his teeth Con grabbed Jack
by the shlack of the pants an’ the other two wid
an arrum apiece an carried ’em to the horse trough
an’ near drownded the three of ’em. But ye nivver
heard p’r’aps ’bout the day his horse shtumbled
over the precipice at Rocky Lead an’ was hangin’
be one shoe to a fizzure in the rock over a fall of
a thousand feet. Thin ’twas that Con grabbed a
rock python that was shtandin’ handy by, an’ makin’
a shlip in his tail, lassoed his ould shtumbler
an’ pulled him to safety.”

“Pick” : A fossil unearthed from the Tor-
bane shale near Mudgee (N.S.W.) proves that at
one time in Australia the gecko was a much more
formidable representative of the reptilia than is the
full-sized specimen of four or five inches found now
in the bush. A perfect imprint between successive
layers of the shale showed the extinct species to have
measured 3ft. 9in. Otherwise in every detail the
fossil was an exact replica of the knobby-tailed lizard
so often mistaken by newcliums for the death-adder.
The probability, though, is that the big fellow had
been long dead. Its tomb was 800 feet under the
surface, and having excavated it the miners simply
cracked up the shale photographs and went on bur-
rowing. To-day’s bread was of more account than
yesterday’s story.
* * * *
“Kriz” : Producing an annual average of
1200 tons of pearl-shell worth from £l5O to £2OO
per ton, the local fleet, consisting of 178 working-
boats, materially helps to make Broome (W.A.)
one of the few utterly self-supporting towns in Aus-
tralia. It’s a far cry to 1838, but in January of
that year H.M.S. Beagle first found pearl-shell in
Roebuck Bay, and the hub of the pearling industry
now stands on its shores. Not till 10 years later
was any serious attempt made to glean the pearl
harvest from the ocean beds. Twenty years
still later native men and women were employed as
divers, and the women were the more expert. In
1868, however, the W.A. Leg. Council prohibited the
employment of women divers, and early pioneers of the
Nor’-West say that they were afterwards employed
in beach-combing and dry-shelling only. Eighty or
so miles up the coast from Broome, Beagle Bay,
named after the ship, keeps green the memory of
the exploring expedition under Lieutenant Grey
which landed there on January 16. Roebuck Bay
conjures up visions of the black flag with skull and
crossbones, for there the pirate Dampier used to
shelter his bad ship Roebuck.
* * * *
"Nitric”: The Upper Condamine River
at Warwick (Q.) is rising considerably, although no
recent rains of any extent have occurred at its
headwaters (the Main Range). But in the dry bed
of the river the sand-reaches show moist surfaces,
and oldtimers declare that these springs are always
liable to “break out” when rain is impending. Other
bush authorities say the springs awaken in drought
time and without reference to impending rain. Which
theory is correct ?
* * * *
“Jesmond” : A friend suffering from tuber-
culosis died recently after having been in bed for
four months. At the beginning of the period he
measured sft. 9in. in height, but when taped by
the undertaker was found to be 6ft. lin. The increase
was not confined to his height, but was shown also
in the length of his arms. The patient himself had
noticed a change during the month or so preceding
his death, and was under the impression that his
body was shrinking, until he found he could touch
the rail at the foot of the bed with his feet. As
the poor chap was in the early thirties, he was long
past the growing age, and had shown no increase in
height during at least 10 years. What is the
explanation ?
* * * *
“Cowes” : The power of survival in some
weeds is remarkable. Recently I filled an old camp-
oven with well-worked soil, and, hanging it in a
copper frame, kept a fire under it for three days.
As the soil was red-hot for several hours each day, I
thought the weed-seeds must have been killed. When
quite cold, I packed it into a box and gave it a
good watering. Within a week there was green
showing, and in a fortnight cape-weed, chick-weed,
fat-hen and several kinds of grasses were thriving
in the soil. The weeds could not have got into
the box after the roasting, as I kept it in a glassed-
in corner of the verandah.
* * * *
“Maatsuyker”: The story of Gilbert’s boots
at Collector (B. 17/6/’26) reminds me that a pair
led to the downfall of Rocky Whelan, Tasmania’s
notorious bushranger. Rocky worked alone and
had a nasty habit of shooting wayfarers in the
back. He acquired his wardrobe by the simple pro-
cess of taking whatever articles of clothing he
needed from his victims. But he had very large
feet and could not secure a pair of boots to fit
THE DANGER SIGNAL.
PARSON: “I am relieved to see you, James.
I saw your wife down town, and as she
was wearing widow’s weeds I thought
perhaps”—
JAMES : “Gripes , wot ’ave I done now? She
always goes into mournin’ for ’er first
when I’ve done somethink.”
him. So he came into Hobart and went into a
bootmaker’s in Elizabeth-street. Rocky was an old
Norfolk Island hand, and a constable who had been
at the island in his spare time spotted him going
into the shop. He followed and fell on Whelan
just as the outlaw was trying on a new pair of
boots. That fitting ended on the gallows.

THE GOLDEN WEDDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oh hear the church bells ringing, a-ringing, a-ringing.
And see the people thronging and hear the organ
peal,
While some of them are kneeling, kneeling, just
kneeling,
With pious heads a-bowing as penitents may kneel.
The men are mostly old men and fat men, all rich
men,
And here and there are women with faces good to
see
Robed in costly splendor, coarse splendor, vain
■ splendor,
For Twenty is marrying old wealthy Fifty-three.
The visitors are bowing and gaping and scraping
(But Twenty is gazing with eyes that do not see) ;
And some of them are weeping, or fawning and
cringing.
Poor Twenty is mating with rich old Fifty-three.
She waits beside her father, bent father, old father,
His will and spirit broken—--a weak nonentity.
But iron-jawed her mother, stout mother, stern
mother,
Her daubs of rouge are hidden by the flush of
victory,
As right and left she glances and gestures and
whispers
Instructions to her husband, quaking at her side;
The bridegroom’s gift of jewels, rare jewels, rich
jewels,
Clasped in a golden setting, gleam on her powdered
hide.
A-swagger comes the bridegroom, stout bridegroom,
gay bridegroom,
His cheeks are pouched and flabby and he has
scanty hair.
The bride’s white hands are clenching, tight clench-
ing, and wrenching,
Her eyes are like the leveret’s that’s startled from
its lair.
And watch the white-robed parson, sleek parson, smug
parson!
Blandly he is smiling—-he is thinking of his fee.
He loves these golden weddings, rich weddings, fine
weddings,
When Twenty is linking up with grizzled Fifty-
three.
AN INSTINCT FOR BUSINESS.
COHEN: “He’s a vonderful baby! Toddles into der shop and turns
der 6s. labels opsides down!”
Confetti falls in showers, bright showers, gay
showers,
As rain might fall in showers on such a wedding
day.
Softly the organ’s pealing, it’s pealing, appealing,
As quickly the motor-cars roll noisily away ;
While those behind are waving and cheering (and
sneering),
The -women group together, each airs a prophecy ;
But ne’er a word of pity, real pity, cheap pity
For Twenty -who is sacrificed to jaded Fifty-
three.

No other car has the super-efficiency of the
new “70” Willys-Knight Six. None other
of its size develops such phenomenal power
and hill-climbing ability, with such remark-
able economy of operation.
With a 2fg-inch bore and a stroke,
the perfected Knight sleeve-valve engine of
the “70” Willys-Knight Six develops greater
power per cubic-inch of piston displace-
ment, throughout its entire range, than any
other stock American engine built today.
Perfected to a point that has gained for it
swift recognition as the worlds highest type
of high-speed engine construction, the
Knight sleeve-valve engine in this car out-
performs anything that ever was built of its
size, or type, or class.
With perfected mechanical 4 - wheel brakes,
the same type of braking system as that used
on the finest and most costly cars of Europe
and America; with 8 Timken roller bearings
in its steering mechanism, (more than any
other American car), the new "70” Willys-
Knight Six, regardless of its great speed and
power, becomes one of the easiest and safest
to drive of all motor-cars.

“Mephisto”: Apropos of the effect of elec-
tricity on growing plants (10/6/’26), even cut
flowers which have wilted will under its influence
brighten up more or less. Recently the inhabi-
tants of an English village were startled to see
a seemingly-dead tree put out shoots after being
used as a support for a badlv-insulated wire-
carrying current. Experiments have been carried

out and they confirm these observations, but
whether the discovery can be put to any practical
use remains to be seen.
* * * *
“Ruarie”: There has been discussion about
the blue-eyed parents of brown-eyed children, but
nobody has mentioned Mendel. His theory is that
dark eyes are a “dominant” characteristic and blue
a “recessive”; that is to say, the dark eyes are
liable to appear in the children of blue-eyed parents,
but that no child ever has blue eyes unless one of
the parents is blue-eyed. I have been testing this
theory by observation for about six years, and so
far have not met an exception.
“Jackeroo”: Cattlemen of “the Desert”
(C.Q.) are having a rough time with the drought,
which they say is much worse than the one in 1902.
If rain does not soon come there will be heavy
losses of stock. The big dam on Fleetwood station
is done —the first time for 35 years. What grass and
spinifex remains is dry as shavings and useless as
feed. Things are pretty bad when the timber on
the hilly country is throwing out distress signals.
Many edible trees have given up the ghost, and hardy
old ironbarks have followed suit. The sap rises in
those parts in July—it rose in July last year, and
because there has been no rain since there is net
sufficient sap now to nourish the trees. Those that
are dying include river-gums, box, ironbark, iance-
wood, yellow-jack, apple-tree, prickly-pine, silky-oak
and others. There is no water for travelling stock
between Aramac and Pentland, a distance of 250
miles. The big salt lake near Pentland has been
dry for months, and the bed of it is now covered with
tons and tons of coarse salt. Five miles from the
lake you can get fine table salt in the caves on the
sunny side of the mountains.
* * * *
“Gin-Sling” : Readers of “Bouragi’s” state-
ment that British settlers in tropical countries do
not mix their blood with colored races may be mis-
led. So far as concubinage is concerned, British
settlers are as guilty as members of other white
races, but with this difference —the former do not
give the publicity to their acts that the latter do
by parading their paramours, nor do they have the
offspring of these alliances reared as if they were
whites. Germans residing in tropical countries be-
fore the war made a practice of allowing their
colored mistresses to live with them openly, and
their children were invariably brought up with and
treated on an equality with whites. Whether the
British way is the better or not is a matter of
opinion. That my facts are right I know, after
two decades’ residence in tropical countries amongst
all nationalities.

“Dingo”: Recent Bulletin pars, anent
the medicinal value of our native plants remind me
that the first result of feeding cattle and sheep on
kurrajong in droughty times is the immediate expul-
sion of all stomach and intestinal -worms. Un-
doubtedly the leaves contain a powerful but safe
vermifuge, and if the tree grew on the headwaters of
the Amazon or up Tanganyika way we should have
heard more of its value.

“Eureka”: “Pick” (B. 8/7/’26) tells a
pretty tale about the first road over the N.S.W.
South Coast ranges, but readers had better take
it with a grain of salt. He says an offer of £5O
induced Joe Jeffreys to cut a track down the
Tantawanglo mountain and with a bullock-team
take 14 bales of Bib-
benluke wool to Two-
fold Bay. The first
road over this range
was not down the
Tantawanglo mountain,
but down the Big Jack,
from Cathcart to Rocky
Hall. It was sur-
veyed by Jack Thorn-
ton, and at the present
time is considered to
be the steepest road in
N.S.W. and a wonder-
ful example of the sur-
veyors’ and road-
builders’ arts. Further,
to take wool down the
Tantawanglo mountain
from Bibbenluke to
Twofold Bay would be
like going round the
world to get from
Sydney to Melbourne.
The Bibbenluke wool
that did go down the
Tantawanglo went to
Merimbula, most of it
via the Big Jack road.
The descent even then
was so steep that large
drags were taken be-
hind to assist the
brakes. Even before
the road was put down
the Big Jack, Monaro
wool was taken to the
seaboard via Towamba,
“Pick” said that Jeff-
reys started out single-
handed to cut the track
down the Tantawanglo
Valley in the early
’fifties. Well, from my
knowledge of that coun-
try he would be about
half-way down now, if
his bullocks had not died from old age.

“O’Cedar” : “Fitz” (B. l/7/’26) wants to
know why white-cedar berries poison pigs, whereas
they don’t seem to injure other creatures that take
them. The pig cracks the nut and thus releases
the poison held in it. On the South Coast (N.S.W.)
cattle often pick up these berries in the grass, but as
Strawberry does not crack the nuts no ill-effects
result.
* * * *
“Elgar”: I don’t think either “Country
Ped” (B. l/7/'’26) or any Vic. farmer, except
possibly in the far N.-W., need worry about prickly-
pear spreading in the south-eastern State. There
have been clumps of it here and there around Mel-
bourne for years, and it has never pushed itself any
distance towards the horizon. There used to be
a thick hedge on vacant land in Richmond,
near what was then the Shamrock Brewery, 36
years ago. It merely stayed put till the subdivider
NO EXCUSE FOR GEORGIE.
BLINKINSTONE : “I think there’s something in what this fellow
says—that the greatness of the father often -proves a stum-
bling-block to the son.”
MRS. B.: “Well, thank goodness, our Georgia won’t have anything
to fall over.”
came along and ran a street over it. Other clumps
still thrive at old, stone-built Keilor, in the rich
soil along the Maribyrnong fiats. The tomato-growers
find that it encroaches, but there is no difficulty at
all in keeping it in check. It was probably brought
there by one of the early fathers, but in 60 or 70
years it hasn’t shown a seedling half a mile away.
The same thing is true of the West Darling (N.S.W.).
In fact, an attempt to grow the spineless variety
iri that droughty region gave quite unpromising
results.

“E.S.S.” : The best watchdog I ever knew 7
was a merino ram, which belonged to Syl Stanley,
of South Casino (N.S.W.). The house stood in
the centre of a square block, and no matter in
what part of it Napoleon, the pet ram, happened
to be, as soon as the gate clicked he was round
to investigate. He walked quietly to the rear of
the 'visitor, and neighbors generally knew by the
yells when the Stanleys had visitors. Napoleon would
stand between the house and the gate, and no
stranger could go far till Mrs. Stanley had hunted
the faithful custodian away. I called there early
one morning, and did four times round the house
before Mrs. Stanley had got into enough drapery
to come and see the race.
* * * *
“Erua”: There is a movement afoot in
Maoriland to have the measurements of the few
remaining great kauri-trees taken and officially
recorded before they become as legendary as the
taniwha and the moa. For the day of the great kauri
is over, and it is doubtful if Maoriland will ever
again see anything to approach the monarchs of
the past. At present the largest known is a splendid
specimen near Waipoua, North Auckland, with a
girth of 50ft. at the base and a barrel also 50ft.
As this tree stands alone on a hillside its days are
numbered, for the kauri does not live when robbed
of the protective growth of the forest, as many
early settlers discovered. But there will be ample
time to put its size on record.
* * * *
“Borom”: There was a curious notion
amongst some old farmers that crops grew better
if planted at night when the moon was in the full,
and were more disease-resistant. A farmer in
Victoria always planted his maize during the full-
moon, and an old identity told me that it was a
fairly common thing in N. S. Wales for crops to
be sown in the way described 60 years ago or
thereabouts. Now, modern research has shown that
seeds germinate better under the influence of polarised
light, which also seems to confer upon them a
certain degree of immunity to disease. As the rays
of the moon are highly polarised, it is just possible
that there was something more in the old idea than
appeared on the surface.
“Bad Australian”: When I was chasing
my beans and “eharqui” on the Higher Andes, we
used ski for four or five months in the year. These
were the best obtainable, made in Bergen, Norway.
They were rather costly by the time they reached
us, so one of our carpenters got busy and made
several pairs after the
pattern of the im-
ported scooter, each of
a different kind of
local timber. The ex-
periment was a success
as far as running was
concerned, but all our
efforts failed to keep
the front ends from
gradually straightening
out, until they were
as flat as the rear. If
this difficulty is not
experienced with ski
made of mountain ash
(B. 8/7/’26), they
should be quite as good
as the Norwegian
ai-ticle, for mountain
ash combines the
qualities of lightness
and extreme toughness
so necessary in the
making of serviceable
ski. By the way, in
an article on ski-
run ner s, Melbourne
Herald (10/7/’26)
tells that “the mails
between Chile and the
Argentine are carried
over the Andes by
relays of Norwegian
ski-runners, of whom
300 are employed.”
The Herald doesn’t
seem to have heard of
the Trans-Andean rail-
way which has been
in operation for years.
Before the railway
crossed the Andes,
winter mail transport
was done by mules,
except when the snow
was too soft to carry
them. When the mules
couldn’t get through,
the bags were carried
by Chilian half-breeds
travelling on “tam-
angos,” the local substitute for snow shoes, with
never a ski or Norwegian ski-runner in the crowd.
* * * *
“Runa”: Even if he were grilling in
Gehenna, Maoriland wouldn’t buy a drink to moisten
the lips of the man who introduced the water-hyacinth
to beautify its ponds and rivers. The weed has
now made its appearance in some of the navigable
streams, and as it has proved capable of stopping
navigation even in large open waters and flooding
low-lying country, the prospect of its rapid increase
is causing a scare. The idea of removing the pest
by manual labor fades into the impossible at Maori-
land rates —it can’t even be done in India and so
far no other means of eradication have been dis-
covered.
PLEASURES UNFORESEEN.
“What did you buy the car for if you can’t
afford to run it?”
“I didn’t build on supporting three people
in the hospital when I took it on.”
“C.T.R.”: A huge fungus was recently
found growing at the edge of an old heap of
horseshoes near a blacksmith’s at Waimate (M.L.).
It measured 4ft. in diameter and was lOin. high.
Springing up almost within a night, it withered
as quickly. As a “puff-ball” it will take some
beating.
TOO BAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Some years ago, in an endeavor to establish the
cork-growing industry in Westralia, I arranged im
the introduction to that State of five or six families
from the cork-growing districts of Spain. They were
Spanish enough when they arrived. Not one of the
party could speak a word of English, and instead
of hats the ladies of the party wore mantillas. When
I looked upon these immigrants I could, in imagina-
tion see groves of cork oaks growing in Western
Australia in a district which I knew was well suited
for the purpose. But, alas, instead of growing cork
oaks, they established fish shops.”- —Senator Kmgsmill.
They came from Spain, the realm of knightly heroes
And chivalry and art and old romance;
Their gay mantillas and their -wide sombreros
Disclosed their race and nation at a glance.
They left their land, did Pedro and Bianca,
The land of oranges and oil and wine,
To bring a breath of storied Salamanca
To Bullabulling and to Doodlakine.
Their forebears hung enraptured on Cervantes
Or mused entranced upon Velasquez’ worth,
And they—ah me! —are running pinkie shanties
And hawking fish in Perth!
From ’neath sierras where there soars the vulture,
From Saragossa or Valladolid,
They came to teach us Spain’s arboriculture —
At least we cheerfully assumed they did.
They left the Douro and the Guadalquiver,
Forsook the scenes Lopez de Vega sung,
To grow us cork beside the Williams River.
And pomegranates at homely Dumbleyung.
They spoke the soft, euphonious Castilian
And hardly understood an English phrase.
I dreamed —alas! my dream is gone-a-million;
They turned from cork to crays!
I featured belts of woodland, dense and splendid,
Exotic oaks our eucalypts amid,
By stock of old hidalgos deftly tended,
Peaceful descendants of the warlike Cid.
I heard, at close of day, guitars a-strumming
And merry castanets were clapped and thumbed;
Op’ratic snatches dark-eyed maids were humming
(Olla podrida even louder hummed).
From Spain, the land of palaces and cloisters,
They came to give us agronomic tips.
And now—it saddens me —they’re opening oysters
And serving fish-and-chips !

&dL Lj;
what an important part hose plays in our industries.
In every direction Dunlop special hoses have to be made
for special purposes, each being different in construction,
thickness, strength, pliability, etc. We illustrate a variety of
DUN
LOP
that are daily rendering economical service—doing their work
silently and satisfactorily at the minimum cost. In mining
centres air hose is used for drilling machines, working up to a
pressure of 20001b5., whilst the hose used on hydraulic machines
is built to withstand a pressure of 30001bs. Steam hose has to be
constructed to withstand the burning effect on the inner rubber
wall of hose. Delivery hose is used for conducting water, under
moderate pressure, on railways and steamships, for horticultural
purposes, &c., &c. In pumping plants, tanneries, breweries,
irrigation work, and for mining and dredging, suction hoses are
essential, and are constructed so that there is no contraction of
sides of hose during suction operations. In breweries and
wineries a variety of hoses are used for conducting beer,
wine, &c., and have to be constructed with special inside rubber
walls to prevent damaging the taste of the liquor. Again, special
hoses are used for paint spraying, conducting oil, acid, and other
materials deleterious to rubber. The largest users of hose in this
country are the various Railway departments—the Westinghouse
brake air hose and vacuum air brake hose being essential to the
braking systems in operation on our railways, and upon which
the safety of the travelling public and railway transport depend.
Many of the above hoses have to be constructed with a covering of
flat or round wire, or woven cotton, to withstand abrasion in use.
All these hoses call for the highest quality of materials and
special construction, and in this direction “ Dunlop” Hoses have
won a fine reputation for dependability and economical service.
Another important factor is that, being made in Australia
they are free from perish and can be made without delay
to suit the requirements of every branch of industry.

STOCKINGS
The calendar and the dress parades cry
’Tis Spring,” and even the boot-tree putteth
forth new buds, the same seeming to say that
soon the corn will be not in the ear but on
the cushiony part of the foot. For the smart-
est shoe (mostly blonde kid or blonde and
patent) has a stilt-like heel. For the rest it is
French, and carries a short vamp. Stock-
ings of the tone called grain go well with
these and are to be seen at a guinea a pair
on legs that but yesterday were blushingly
celluloid. The newest bag is of enamelled
kid, and can be had in the tenderest lilacs,
blues and pinks. Your frock and hat, it
would seem, must crescendo to or diminuendo
from the note of your handbag, and the only
parts of you that need bother to match are
your hands and your feet. All summer
materials for day wear are patterned pro-
fusely, batiked or printed, and organdies
bloom with woollen flowers. Rainbow-
striped delaines made with plain borders for
collars and cuffs are being warmly regarded
by the sports girl, and velvet ribbon is worn
by hats of the best families. Of hats it may
be further said that their brims are heard of
but not often seen ; and no wonder, for every
Jiair-line of brim seems to add guineas to
the price. As to evening frocks, the one
thing on which they are agreed is that they
must be backless.
Wattle Day, which by the calendar fell
on Sunday—a day of sunshine, very sooth-
ing to the spine—was celebrated more or
less on the 2nd. And this was a day of steady
rain and an almost complete absence of the
golden plume. But in any case it is useless
lor the League to issue its edict that Wattle
Day shall come in on the threshold of
August. The trees are not nearly into their
golden dress at that date. Golden Avattle,
silver wattle, blue wattle and wattle of
Cootamundra „vill come into their glory in
another two or three weeks, and it seems a
pity not to celebrate the day when, fastened
in every woman’s brooch, in every man’s
lapel, there might glow a spray of sunshine
gold.
A circular about the proposed aquatic club
toi* Limbless Soldiers deserves a mention,
■vi® ldea f° f° rm a . club to induce dis-
abled men to engage in swimming, water
polo, rowing and sailing, as such water sports
are considered the best exercise for limbless
men, particularly those with leg amputa-
tions. I here are 550 of these cases among
ttie Limbless Association’s members. As row-
ing and sailing are by their cost prohibitive
to most returned “stumpies,” and as,
1 lgger-like, they refuse to be objects of pity,
w Ibey are if they just drop in at the
public baths, an aquatic club of their own
seems essential. Tom Fox, of the Rotary
f lub, is the director and treasurer of the
movement. Whatever property is acquired
tor the club will become an asset of the
1 rovident Fund, which already has £9OOO
towards its nest-egg of £50,000.

evangelising to do before she gets all Sydney
to accept Castleerag architecture as the right
thing for the climate. “Where are your

particular will demand.
There were a few pensive brows the other
morning when the papers announced the pre-
sent Mayor as the likely occupier of the
rabbit-skins when George of York and his
Duchess are in our midst. Anguished ladies
1 emembered the Nationalist tilt they had
to their noses on occasions when
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh and they had met
around committee tables. Will the young
Mayoress reply to their unspoken scorn by
a cool ignoring of their names when cards
to the royal functions are being issued, or
will she, emulating the other Cecilia, send
nothing but chords of great harmony from
the civic organ-loft?
™ A A tho^' h w , e are “cute little copy-cats,”
iadith Gray has come all the way from
Nebraska, where she teaches architecture in
the estate University, to have a look at
Australian architecture and house design
from the housewife’s point of view. The
Ideal Homes Exhibition has absorbed much
of her attention since landing in Sydney,
and she is going further afield in the State
to see what architects have done about the
heat problem.
Pianist i rank Hutchens, whose Sonata
was one of the hits of the Maoriland pro-
p’ll*101111? broadcasted across this continent
.c . other night,_ was himself playing to
millions of American ears a few weeks ago.
He was engaged to play Beethoven and De-
bussy from the WEAP station at a fee only
second to that paid to Josef Hoffmann the week
before. Hoffmann’s cheque was for £5OO.
Frank’s real business abroad was to study
the progress of orchestral music, and as the
limited States are credited with having the
*-he day, among them the
i iiiladelphia Symphony, his leave from the
Lon. was spent in America. Among inter-
esting things he did was to attend a confer-
ence of music-teachers in Oregon. This he
found instructive and stimulating, and it in
turn was so impressed by the Australian that
it asked him to give a piano recital, and later
a lecture on Australia and its musical possi-
bilities. Here, too, he met Freddy Shipman,
now running a paper called Musical West.
He saw Sydney’s old musical director Ver-
brugghen, and heard the quartet play at a
musical party given in the home of a Min-
neapolis millionaire. Jenny Cullen’s fiddle
still sings with its old purity and sweetness.
Actor Warde Morgan, creeping back very
slowly to health in Jenner hospital, had an
organ recital all to himself the other day.
Sick of the radio, sick of the gramophone
and wearied of books, Warde heard the open*
mg notes of the Miserere on one of those
organs which, unlike other instruments, are
despised for being worked by hand. A flush
ot eagerness mounted to his cheeks, and by
a willing nurse he sent an invitation to the
alfresco musician in Macleay-street. Into
the room came Giuseppe, the quick, dark
eyes taking in every detail of furniture and
patient. Once, twice he played through his
repertoire, and the young man in bed
sparkled with some undivulged thought. Then
to Giuseppe’s amazed delight the fee of his
life was handed out —7s. 6d. Outside the
hospital gates Giuseppe looked up from his
silver-crossed palm to Jenner. “Good health
will come back,” he said, as one who knows.
It is five years since Gladys Verona
looked at you from these pages. Since then
she has been to London, has sung at Covent
Garden and made a place for herself as a
concert singer. With the Carl Rosa Opera
Company she
made her de-
but as Gilda,
the rOle in
which she first
sang in Frank
Rigo’s company
in Melbourne.
In London her
singing of
“Caro Nome”
induced one
front - rank
critic to write
of her as a
“veritable
find”; in Mel-
bourne it had
induced a vice-
regal to send
round her own
bouquet to the
misg ui d e d
daughter o f
Rigolett o.
From Sir Daniel Godfrey came the statement
that she was an ideal Mozart singer; and
from her growing list of engagements came
the inner knowledge that her voice was
attaining the perfection for which she had
worked so earnestly. Family affairs and the
need of Australian sunshine brought her back
to Sydney. Later on she faces America and
its infinite possibilities.
City Tattersall’s put up its colors at the
Palais one night last week and took a
sprint in the club’s first jazz meeting. Weight
for age, the entries were a credit to Aus-
tralia, and the music and supper worthy to
celebrate a day oil which not one favorite
had won. Mayoress Cecilia Walsh, in lilac
georgettes sprayed with crystal, came along
to welcome six white-clad debs, into the
social whirl; Mrs. James Clarke, president
of the flutter, sponsored them in colorful
raiment in which flame georgettes and gold
lace mingled.
St. Mark’s switched on its electrics mid-
way through last week so that Canon
Howard Lea could see to tie the knot that
binds Mary Wilkinson, of Darlinghurst, to
Finley Leitch, of Rose Bay. The bride, who
was squired by her brother, enfolded herself
in ivory and gold brocades and Spanish lace.
Gold taffetas and a posy of blue delphiniums
and gold roses were added to the picture by
Thelma Leitch, and the same coloring was
carried out in the wearwithall of the bride’s
nieces who acted as trainbearers.

Bathurst lapped up Mendelssohn last week
as pleasedly as the Persian laps cream when
Helen (Betty) Busby and Maxwell Gordon
Edgell stepped down the aisle of St. Stephen’s
after being made one by Padre Campbell
Grieve. Ivory satins, a mist of tulle and a
Limerick-lace veil were items of the pretty
bride’s outfit worthy of mention. Her
flowers were a long sheaf of hyacinths and
lilies of the valley from which dripped pale
mauve orchids that looked as though grown
under a cathedral dome rather than in the
atmosphere of a conservatory. To the pageant
sister Margaret and friend Ruth Palmer
added lilac and silver-shot taffetas, shady
cnn. hats garnished with velvet ribands, and
high silver baskets that started as a safe
deposit for pink roses and ended in an over-
draft of mauve stock and lavender.
Avice Margaret Harvey (her father was
L)r. Watson Harvey, of Leura) named Satur-
day at St. Mark’s for her linking with
Charles Marsden Stuart, one time of Jo’burg
Lace was a big ingredient of the bridal attire.
It formed the long, pointed bodice, and veiled
the skirt of gold tissue. The veil, too, was
a fine old family affair of Limerick lace.
Bride s brother, Dr. Cotter Harvey, gave the
bride away, and later their mother gave re-
freshments away at her Point Piper home.
A grafting of one pioneer family of Queens-
land upon another was successfully carried
out by Padre Loft at St. Philip’s last week.
JLhe bride, one of the most charming that
Church Hill has seen, was Jessie Alma
Moore. Jean Paine, daughter of General
Paine, of Windsor, was the only maid, and
brother-in-law Joseph Hayes, of Brewarrina,
gave the be-crystalled, georgetted and court-
trained bride over to the keeping of Edward
Hugh Barton, of Cooniambia station, in the
Coonamble district.
Hazel Litchfield, of Cooma, came up to
town for her wedding to Norman Allen, an-
other citizen of Cooma. Neither name needs
a foreword to polo players. The bride, in
Greuze-like billows of white-dotted chiffons
and tulle, was piloted up St. Mark’s by father
and convoyed by sister Mrs. John Wilkinson,
notable above the latter’s creamy raiment be-
ing a picturesque straw hat, old rose in tone,
demurely trimmed with velvet. The bride’s
grandmother, Mrs. P. W. Hixson, housed the
subsequent handshaking at Elizabeth Bay.
Maud Owen has said the word that sets a
clume ringing in the heart of Sidney E.
Ihurgood and sets a circlet on her own left
hand. Sidney hails from the Macleay River
where the Thurgoods are of the best-known
families; Maud is one of Sydney’s most pro-
mising pianists.
Betty Ryrie, the pretty youngest daughter
of the Edwin Ryries, continues to win
European bravos as a dancer. As Betty
Delaune she has appeared in nearly every
old-world capital, and during her Cannes
season Domergue, the well-known Paris
artist, asked permission to paint her—her
red-gold hair fascinated him.
Sydney’s omnivorous art

enriched the National Gallery by a collection
ot Norman Lindsays. These included 10
water-colors and four pen-and-ink drawings
by the hermit of Springwood. Since 1924

landed over to the Gallery, of which he is

Phillips.

oastiemame (Vic.) native who is managing
director of the Hongkong and Shanghai
tiotels. Ltd., will be sorry to learn that
ins wife, whom he had recently brought back
to Australia on a health trip, died on the
return journey to Hongkong.
A line from “A.G.M.” (Lond.) :
The E. J. Carroll pair, who have both had a
spell of ill health since they rashly challenged an
unusually severe English winter, are back to normal
and thoroughly enjoying the varied delights which
London’s theatre world has to offer. They have
left the Savoy Hotel and are more than comfortably
settled in a fine Mansfield-street flat, which they
have rented from Lord Congleton. This young peer
is the head of the family to which Parnell, the Irish
leader, belonged, and is a direct descendant of the
Sir John Parnell who in the eighteenth century
also put up a good fight in the Irish cause. “E.J.”
has had many flattering offers from people anxious
to lure him into London management.
When breaking off a matrimonial engagement at
the eleventh hour in Melbourne three or four years
ago, Evelyn Scotney announced that she was irrevocably
wedded to her profession. This did not prevent her
joming up with Ben Harold Russell, of the Cunard
Steamship Co., to whom she was married at St.
Clement Danes on June 15. Evelyn, whose beauty
is threatened by increasing plumpness, looked very
picturesque in a short outfit of blue and silver-shot
tissue and a helmet-like shimmering hat which
recalled Wagnerian heroines. Among the Australasian
musicians who helped her through the ceremom
were Arthur Mason, Gladys Moncrieff, Ada Crosslev.
Horace Stevens, Gertrude Johnson and Stella Murray.
Miss Murray has since given a recital at the .Kolian
flail and received a number of press bouquets on the
rich quality of her voice and the sincerity, sympathy
and intelligence of her interpretations. For a while
she acted as secretary to Melba when the Diva's
professional work had ceased to be strenuous.
Miss Brisbane’s end-of-tlie-winter doings:
Wedding bells have been rung for Clover (Honey),
younger daughter of Dr. Robert Thompson, and Neil
Jackson, son of Dr. and Mrs. E. S. Jackson. The
bride, who is a grand-daughter of W. O. Hodgkinson,
the explorer, was in cream taffetas. Aileen Thompson
’maided in peach-pink georgette. The party was at
the National, where-Mrs. E. S. Jackson wore mauve
georgette and a black satin coat.
At the State Orchestral concert Vera Parker was
the only feminine soloist, in rose-du-barri satin, beaded
m white and silver. The Lieut.-Governor, the Philp
dame and several brass-hats were in the audience.
The Council of Women has been in conference
on all questions from the legal status of women to
care of aborigines, from uniform divorce laws to
infantile paralysis. The intrepid ladies have been
taken out by motor and river launch by way of
recreation, and have not been disdainful of the
gallons of Bohea poured in their honor. The
W.C.T.U. gave them a lunch.
Edna Campbell decked the Brae with roses, sweet-
peas, wattle and fragrant violets for a pre-wedding
tea to Pearl Lahey. Pauline Elliot was amongst
those who sang, and the bride-elect wore cyclamen
maroeain.
Loma Ruddle set an Early-Victorian doll at the
place of each guest for her tea to Olga Phillips, and
Iceland poppies and sweet-peas backgrounded the
little ladies. The hostess was in coffee-lace and
the bride-elect in blue.
Shakspeare’s heroines are to appear at the Theatre
Royal on August 6 for the Allan Wilkie fund. The
Shakspeare Society had its meeting in the Women’s
Club rooms, when A. D. Graham presided and Merna
Gilhes, Nell Douglas Graham, Mildred Bell, Fred
Horner and Le° Guyatt figured on the programme.
Coffee was served, but no pistols.
St. Margaret’s Old Girls took All Saints’ Hall
for their dance, with decorations of wattle and
poinsettia. There was a big roll-up.
The United Service Club has had a small dance
decorated with flags and Iceland poppies, Captain
and Mrs. Ray Stanley receiving. General and Mrs.
Foote, Colonel and Mrs. Evans, Colonel and Mrs.
Ridley, captains and lieutenants galore, and Doris
0 Mahoney, Olga Barnes and Minty Barry were
amongst the bidden.
The ball to help along the fund of the Mater
Children’s Hospital was held in the Crystal Palace.
The Lieut.-Gov. and Mrs. Lennon were there; Mrs.
Lennon, who was in velvet and jet, was handed a
bunch of red roses. There were 29 debs, in froekings
from dead white to palest pink, with bouquets of
roses, hyacinths and sweet-pea. Mrs. Windsor, in
shaded mariette and gold lace, presented the buds'.
The presentation trophies for the Inter-state Croquet
Tournament were handed out at the Windsor Croquet
Lawns by Mayor Jolly. Mrs. T. A. Bell (South Side
Club) won the gold medal championship for singles,
and, with Mrs. M. Clark, the doubles. She played
21 games and won 19.
R. R. Jackson, son of Colonel and Mrs. Jackson,
of Ashfield (Sydney), was married to Grace, daughter
of the H. Smiths, of Montville, in St. Mary’s,
Montville, a few days ago. The ’moon is doing
whatever moons do in Sydney.

One Thousand
Beautiful Things
chosen from the life and literature of the world
BY
ARTHUR MEE
We recommend this wonderful Book to every
reader, young or old. Three hundred and twenty
pages full of the rare and beautiful.
It is probably true that nothing we know stirs the heart and. kindles
the mind as the sight or the thought of a beautiful thing.
Everywhere around us beauty lies, spreading itself about the earth,
working its way into human life, sinking for ever into the hearts of
men. All through the year, all round the world, all down the
ages we find it. Oft we have travelled in this realm of gold. Some
of us have been travelling through it ten years, twenty years, fifty
years, and the further we go, the older we grow, the more beautiful
is life’s garden. Here in these pages are some of its fruits.
That is why we recommend the old and young to
buy and read ARTHUR MEE’S One Thousand
Beautiful Things.

Moonee Valley racecourse, with lawns all
fresh and green, gum-trees bursting into
dower and leaf, and wattle-trees all golden,
drew a Saturday crowd that wasn’t worry-
ing very much about either gums or wattles.
The hounds had met earlier in the day, and
their followers came along in their huntin’
kit, giving an English atmosphere to the
scene. The perfume of daphne and brown
boronia, exhaled from many coat-posies, gave
a breath of spring. Most of the women wore
long coats and fur wraps. Ilia Morton
displayed the fashionable touch of crimson
upon a frock and hat of natural kasha cloth ;
her mother wore the same toned apparel,
with millinery of snuff-brown; Mrs. Jim
Ferguson was in dark cosmos shade topped
by black velvet millinery; Dr. T. Walker
Sinclair brought his wife, snugly clad in
black cloth trimmed with grey fox fur;
and Barbara Madden, wearing smart riding
attire, also caught the eye.
The ball for dogs and other pets at St.
Kilda Town Hall on Friday night was one
of the most tremendous social occasions of
the century so far as the younger set was
concerned. Really nice girls’ schools from
as far afield as Geelong disgorged cohorts of
flappers, who, with their boy friends, danced
under draperies of green and mauve, lit by
Chinese lanterns. Mrs. Lort Smith, who
engineered the dance, wore a gown of blonde
lace over lime satin. Her sister, Marion
Montgomery, wore a black georgette frock
with a bordering of diamente twinkling in
harmony with shoes that were all a-sparkle.
Mrs. Arthur Payne, who displayed blue-and-
gold Chinese embroidery on a black gown;
Mrs. Fred Krcrouse, and Mrs. H. McL.
Duigan. had jazz caps, balloons and the like
on sale for the cause. Taffeta was most in
favor for frocks. One of them, with a skirt
in pannier style, was in pale blue with
splashings of pink roses. Pixie Tabart had
a sash of silver, rose and blue circling her
black frock; dark-eyed Phyllis Mein, who
inherits mother’s good looks, wore flame geor-
gette ; Aileen Lemon glimmered in pink and
crystal; Barbara Lewis experimented with
silver lame, silver lace and pink roses, and
Norma Collins with geranium-red georgette,
chenille traced, bordered with leopard-skin;
and Carmyle Starr appropriately gave an
imitation of the firmament in silver and blue
lace. Olga Geddes, who tripped an exhibi-
tion round with Russell Bradshaw, was a
charming picture in sea-green with floatings
of tulle in faint contrasting shades.
His Ex. and Lady Somers occupied a box
at the opening night of the “San Toy” season
at the Playhouse. Her Ex., who wore apri-
cot georgette beneath a sable coat, was
handed a presentation posy of peach blos-
som, fluttering blue ribbons, by the small
daughter of conductor George English.
Colonel Davidson and his wife, also Chief
.Justice Irvine’s lady and Dora Wood, camped
in the vice-regal compound. There were lash-
ings of flowers for the players.
At the latest Austral Salon dance the
decorations were in two shades of yellow,
veiling the light, and Iceland poppies bloomed
in window-boxes against new Curtains of
blue. The Salon’s secretary, Mrs. Quinnell,
danced in silver lace interspersed with
delf-blue georgette. Mrs. J. L. Stein
(of the committee) had filmy black lace and
black taffeta raiment. Misses A. Richardson
and E. Billinghurst looked after the secre-
tarial duties; and Mrs. F. Beavis and Gwen
Watt helped to run the show. Of the smartly-
gowned was Mrs. Treaby (professionally the
singer Amie Lilian) —her apparel of pea-
cock-green was embroidered in silver.
A sequel to the conference of Rotarians
held at Honolulu ivas a jolly party called
together at Scott’s by president Harold Cohen
and his wife, who headed the Rotarians that
represented Melbourne over there. The jollo
was termed a Hawaiian evening, and as
glad hands were gripped in greeting Barbara
Cohen decorated each guest with a
Hawaiian necklace. The host brought back
moving pictures and photographs, which were
screened with appropriate accompaniments
by a Hawaiian band, Tom Masters singing
the favorite “Aloha oe” and other native
songs between the pictures. A specially-
written welcome to the president set to the
tune of “A Long, Long Trail” was carolled
by the fx-aternity before supper, and then
ukulele and steel guitar were packed away
and a more conventional jazz orchestra set
everybody jigging.
The Roystone Davey couple, of Sydney,
were feted during their fortnight here. Mrs.
Harry Prell’s feast in the lady’s honor was
laid on blue tablecloths at Menzies’. The
chief guest wore a fuchsia-colored hat with
a grey ensemble suit, and tbe hostess was a
study in bois-de-rose. The Alexandra Club
was chosen for the final farewells, when the
visitor returned hospitality by dispensing tea
while George Brooke sang and Eddie Cahill
played.
The younger set rolled up at the Play-
house to see “Advertising April” put on by
a number of youthful amateurs. The strong-
est attraction, probably, was an after-the-
show dance on the stage. The audience
consisted mainly of well-frocked, nicely-
shingled girls and well-laundered youths, all
on good terms with the performers, who were
doing their bit for the Dame Nellie Free
Kindergarten at Richmond. Ray Whiting,
who produced the play, handled the role of
April’s advertiser cleverly, and Margaret
Nicholson was the movie girl “who made the
sunshine jealous.” Her Eton crop was seen
first on top of a pyjama suit of filmy pink
having butterflies embroidered at the knees,
worn with a dressing-gown of deep cyclamen
hue. Later she appeared in yet another
pair of trousers, in harem attire, and finally
in a frock of blue of almost Lewis and Wliitty
intensity with a dash of l’ed in flares and
buttons. Madge Breheny made a hit as the
star’s factotum, who had played many parts;
and Elizabeth Mackey sported the sweetest
of faint pink gowns, all tiny frills, with a
harmonising transparent hat.
When the Stradbrokes visited Gippsland
they stayed at Powerscourt with John Mills,
and inspected the stables and talked horse
whilst an enterprising cinema-man churned
a handle. In London recently the Mills
couple dropped into Australia House, suffer-
ing from a touch of home-sickness, and got
a tonic; amongst the films depicting home-
life in Australia was their own place at
Maffra, and themselves roaming familiar!'.'
around with our late Governor and his tall
lady.
Elsy Treweek has become quite a com-
manding-looking prima-donna during her
stay on the other side. Her first appear-
ance since her return was at the Phil.’s
three-nights’ season of Gounod’s “Faust,”
when the soprano, as Mhrgarita, woke even
the critics. At the second performance her
black shingled locks surmounted a gown of
deep petunia hue which had glistening effects
attached to a low waist-line marked with
jewelled lace. Viola Morris, who warbled
sweetly as Siebel, was a slim figure in sky-
blue taffeta with a trail of mauve velvet
ribbon from her left shoulder; and
Martha (Violet Semple) wore orange-hued
draperies.
Melbourne hasn’t produced many brilliant
women pianists, but Louise Gargurevich, pic-
tured here by
Laf ay ettc,
qualifies.
Benno Sclierek
taught her,
and then, in
L o n d o n,
Tobias Ma t-
tliay; and M.
Phillipp, of
Paris, put on
the French
polish. Miss
G a r g u revich
has been in
her home town
two years, and
her few ap-
pearances on
the concert
platform have
brought forth
much admir-
ing criticism.
She ought to
be heard in concertos, but there appears to
be an unwritten ridiculous law in this city
that women pianists must not be invited
to play with either of the orchestral bodies.
Miss Gargurevich is native-born; French and
Hungarian blood flows in her veins.
Under the intriguing title of Ua Masque
Dramatique, a number of the younger set
intend launching yet another club for the
production of original plays and playlets.
To get some financial backing they are hold-
ing a dance at the St. Kilda Memorial Hall
on August 7. The little company, when
launched, intends -to devote its profits, if
any, to charitable objects. Ewina Ander-
son, of 16 Vautier-street, Elwood, can tell
about it.
Now that housekeeping is regarded as a
science, our exclusive educational establish-
ments are beginning to give the subject some
attention, thus returning to the curriculum
laid down for the younger sprigs of the smart
set in 1200 B.c. The M.L.O. at Glenferrie
teaches cooking, laundry work, and dress-
making, thanks to the generosity of Mr. G.
R. Nicholas, who built the Home Science
School within the grounds. The building was
opened with due ceremony last week, Mrs.
Nicholas turning the door key while 500
students warbled songs of thanksgiving.
The Limbless Soldiers’ Association, which
looks after 945 mutilated soldiers in this
State, is going to hold a Button Day on Sep-
tember 10 in aid of its cashbox. Mayor
Brunton is combining the duties of president
and treasurer, with Senator Guthrie as chair-
man. The amount raised by the Dame Nellie
Melba appeal for the benefit of limbless sol-
diers is a separate fund, and cannot be used
for any of the activities of the L.S.A. of Vic-
toria; hence the need for a separate appeal.
This reflective-looking maiden is Margot
Mac Gibbon, who won her L.A.B. with a re-
markable performance —she got top marks
for both piano
and violin, and
scored a three
years’ scholar-
ship at the
Royal Acad-
emy of Music
(London). She
is a pupil of
Hilda Roberts,
who has
coached her in
her piano
studies, and of
Gertrude
Ilealy, of the
Albert - street
Con., who has
led her fiddle
in the way it
should go.
Marietta studio
caught the
clever girl at
a moment
when she was pondering whether she should
go to London or not.
Edna Armytage, who is in India, sends
nows of her engagement to Major Bailey,
Air Force Squadron-leader. The wedding
will take place soon —probably at Gungal,
\vhere the bride-elect is at present staying.
When the Major is on furlough next April
the couple will visit Australia and stay with
mamma —Mrs. Norman Armytage, of South
Wrra.
Tcan Edworth Lillie, youngest daughter of
the E. W. Lillies, of East Malvern, has re-
ceived a betrothal ring from Dr. lan Donald
Mcl lines, of Thornbury, an old St. Ivilda boy.
Al's„ 1 Stephen’s engagement to Dr. Rich-
ard Te-’ce, of Sydney, has won family appro-
val. Aiison who is at present the guest ot
Mrs. Leslie Walford, is a frequent visitor to
Sydney when her cousin Viola Hordern is
there, and has lots of other cousins settled
around, so her life won’t be lonely. She is
the only daughter of the Sydney Stephens,
of Brighton, and that way is connected
with the Maddens.
Bertha Barrett is being proudly escorted
around by her new fiance, John D. Vanning,
who comes from Hawke’s Bay (M.L.).
Bertha is the second daughter of our largest
knight, and both he and his small pale lady
are wearing a smile of approval.
Jean, the only daughter of the F. F.
Leslies of Caulfield, has accepted a ring and
a promise in London from Captain W.
McGregor, M.C., who wears the kilties ot
the Highland Light Infantry.
Another chance in the marriage-lottery has
been secured by Mrs. Dorothy M. Connelly,
a daughter of the John Maclellans, of Wind-
sor. The groom is Captain Dermot Robert
Hanlon, Royal Field Artillery, whose roof-
tree casts a shadow at Cheltenham (Lng.).
Vows were exchanged on July 8t ot.
Thomas’s Cathedral, Bombay, Captain Han-
lon’s regiment being at present in India.
Doreen, known to her pals as Dawn, the
youngest daughter of the R. J. McDougalls
of Kew, was a vision in golden fabric and
Brussels lace when she met Dr. Reginald
Mills, of Tatura, the other evening. The
two ’maids, Lottie Norman and the bride s
little niece Nclla Marks, radiated in frocks
of the same glowing hue. The older maid
wore a lace hat to harmonise; and the wee
lassie’s locks were wreathed with yellow
blossoms.
Linda Freame, who changed names during
the week, was first the heroine of an Austral
Salon tea, with musical trimmings. Mrs.
Harry Vial hostessed, with the aid of daugh-
ter Lily; and the bride, who will make her
home in Canada, was laden with much
beautiful blossomry.
Aylmer Buesst, the Melbourne musical boy
who has climbed high in London, was mar-
ried on June 17 to May Blythe, a member
of the British National Opera Co. (Aylmer
has just resigned as conductor of that co.
to become principal of the Guildhall School
of Music.) His brother Victor also married
and settled in London.
Pauline Bindley, who last year went round
to the other side of the globe in search of a
career as a singer, has fallen on her feet. A
cable announces that she will make her debut
with the Carl Rosa Company in London in
the leading role in “The Barber.”
In a recent Australia House crowd was
an old Australian whose name has become
just a memory: Mrs. Stoneham, better re-
membered as Pattie Brown, of the Brough-
Boucicault co. Smartly gowned and keenly
interested in Australian topics and exhibits,
she showed little sign of the years that have
passed since last she visited her homeland.
To be original is becoming difficult, but
there’s a Finnish bride in this city who
managed a new sort of honeymoon. She mar-
ried Captain Eyder in New York the day be-
fore his sailing, and shipped on his vessel,
the Woodburn, as a deckhand in order to
comply with marine laws. Captain Eyder
declares that he never sailed with a better
mate.
Another sea romance has resulted in a
wedding, Linda Mary, elder daughter of the
E. ,T. Freames, of Middle Park, whispering
“I will” to John H. Henderson, of Cleveland,
U.S.A. The bridal gown was white and
silver lame cut with a long train, and glit-
tered with diamente under a froth of tulle,
and the veil was held in its place by
a circlet of orange blossoms. The two
attendants, sister Norma and Doris Moore,
were also in white and silver with rivulets
of tulle and quaint poke bonnets relieved
with colored posies. No. 9 was later invaded
by a merry throng. Mr. and Mrs. Hender-
son will drift round the world on a long
honeymoon before settling down in Cleveland.
Lady Hastings, who has been earning a
nice salary as a dress-designer in a smart
Melbourne shop whilst her husband gained
some knowledge of the country, has left
town for the Riverina. Before going to
Queensland, and perhaps farther, the couple
will join several house-parties in N.S.W. On
their return, according to present intentions,
they will acquire some land and try their
luck with sheep. The tall, slim, dark lady,
though Italian by birth, is quite Anglicised.
Helen Stransky just missed blazing up one
night last week. She was busy in her dress-
ing-room putting the finishing touches on
Tondeleyo when some cosmetic preparation
she was heating over a gas-jet caught fire.
As she was transferring the stuff to her eye-
lashes at the time, the actress was lucky in
not getting a lot worse than singed.
Sister Adelaide remembers many things:—
Harold Buxton, now in holy orders and booked
for the “Near East,” where he will do special work
for the Bishop of Jerusalem, is remembered here as
a pink-faced youth in long ’uns, Eton coat and top
hat, plus a huge green-lined umbrella, the garb
prescribed for him and his brother during the first
summer of the Buxton vice-regency in this State.
Lady Bridges has set cards circulating for a series
of “diminishing teas” —funds for Girl Guides their
objective. The first was at Government House with
herself as hostess, and Mrs. Bruce followed with one
at the Town Hall. Mrs. Bruce hostessed an eleven-
o’clock tea, too, for Miss Freda Bage, who had a
hectic time for the few hours the Ormonde was in
port. At the Town Hall her fellow-guests were chiefly
women interested in local public and social move-
ments. Then there was lunch with the League of
Nations Union, where special tribute was paid to the
help the delegate-elect had had from her predecessors,
Mrs. Mackinnon and Mrs. Dale, and to the Federal
Attorney-General’s enthusiasm for the league.
The Moulden dame bade members of her Adelaide
Hospital Auxiliary to tea at the hospital kiosk, when
the sewing-circle’s equipment for three wards was
handed over to the matron. The parcel contained
2435 articles- —from bed linen to bed-jackets and
screen-covers. There was bridge in aid of funds
at the Town Hall next day.
Blue waved triumphant over the Adelaide Oval
when St. Peter’s emerged victorious at intercollegiate
football (for some reason a much rarer win for them
than at cricket), and Lady Bridges handed their
captain the Cup. The Governor was at the Old
Blues’ dinner in the evening, where there was, for
the first time, an Old Blue in the headmaster’s seat
-—F. A. Wyatt is locum tenons while Mr. Bieker-
steth is on leave in England.
Hunting on Saturday was at Strathalbyn, its chief
incidents a big field, many road-followers, many falls,
and excellent going. Lancelot Stirling, who has god-
fathered every run in the hills township, was at
the station with the Mayor and Hurtle Morphett to
meet the Adelaide contingent; there was a cheek at
the Jim Tuckers, and tea with a hospitable com-
mittee at the Institute.
The Telford-Hughes wedding was at Christ Church,
with toast-drinking at the bride’s home on Brougham-
place. She is the widow of the late Arthur Hughes,
one of the Athelney clan (before her first marriage,
Lizzie Stevenson, of Port Lincoln), and he a Ballarat
medico. Her aunt, Mrs. Love, hostessed the reception.
Officially, Pavlova barred social engagements while
she’s here, but she has found time for one or two
interludes. There was a visit to Simon Harvey's
aviaries at Millswood —one of the finest collections in
the Commonwealth —and another to the Society of
Arts and Crafts. To the latter she went in class
time, thereby winning the adoration of every student
present, especially the lucky ones over whose shoulders
she peeped with a word of appreciation or encourage-
ment. The Bridges have been in her audiences twice.
All Adelaide is puzzled over the death of the 19-
year-old son of the well-known winemaker Penfold
Hyland. He was at a big dance at Glenelg, and things
got rather “willing” after midnight. The one
thing certain is that his dead body was found only
a few hundred yards up the Adelaide-road. He had
had a tiff with two other young men whom he had
ridden down with, and whether he got a lift and
fell out of another car or was hit by a car when
walking, and in general how he got the head injuries
that Caused his death, is a topic on which there are
many suggestions but no clear conclusions.

NEW EDISON REALISM
Challenges the world!
Where but in the New Edison can you find
reproduction as real as the living artist ?
The New Edison is in truth the living artist—so clear, so sweet, so true is its
Re-Creation of the artist’s performance. Edison music is the music of life,
exquisitely rich in qualities too subtle to be given a name.
Claims are easily made, but Edison alone presents the dramatic test of Direct
Comparison between Edison artists and their Edison records—heard by
millions of music lovers and critics everywhere. No phonograph but the
New Edison has dared present such a test to a discriminating audience.
To show our belief in the New Edison, we offer you the opportunity of hearing
it in your own home in direct comparison with any machine, new or old.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Two-year-olds racing in open company on
the last day of the season at Warwick Farm did well
enough to suggest that the three-year-old form is
going to be above the average. The Greenstead —-
Airify filly Calmest (8 to 1) beat everything but'
Otacre, who is still a fast horse, in the first division
of the Varroville Handicap, six furlongs; and the
Maoriland-bred Young Lochinvar (5 to X) exhibited
grit as well as pace in the second division, in which
he accounted for Eh Timi (also from Maoriland),
Stoneykirk (a brother to Hinchinbrook) and several
other speedy ones. A gelded son of Gay Lad —Arch
Lassie, Young Lochinvar is trained by F. D. Jones
and was ridden by McCarten, a combination that
Sydney knows well. None of the youngsters could
extend Tullulah’s half-sister Chrystal (3 to 1) in
the first division of the Maiden Handicap, six fur-
longs, the grey putting in a memorable finish; but
Pirate King (4 to X) ran a good second to Bewnol
(25 to 1) in the second division, after encountering
a lot of trouble on the journey; and Windbag’s
brother, Bicolor, satisfied everyone that he is the
makings of a good horse. Having his first race, and
not in the betting, the son of Magpie—Charleville
was third last at the entrance to the short straight,
but from there to the judge’s box he galloped so
brilliantly on the outside that he passed 17 opponents,
fust missing a place. He is better looking than
Windbag was at his age, and though he is not
likely to be a better horse, Randwick is confident
that he will have a distinguished turf career, barring
accidents. Whizbro (7 to 1), whose recent per-
formances have been creditable, defeated Freddie C.
(7 to 1), Royal Dighton (6 to 1) and 10 others
in the Homebush Handicap, 10 furlongs, after a
struggle which was in doubt, as regards first and
second, till the numbers went up. Whizbro (Bernard
—Simmerdale), who is trained by George Price,
the most successful Randwick trainer during the
season (William Kelso Was next), has received some
support for the Metropolitan, in which he lias the
bottom weight, but may not be quite class enough.
Backers were waiting for Quan Tart to be produced
at Warwick Farm, but the owner gave the Quantock
gelding a run in the Flying Handicap at Moorefield
on Monday instead. He had to take evens for his
money, but it was never in doubt; when veteran
Joe Lightfoot let his head go the chestnut made
short work of the moderates opposed to him. One
of those horses that never run badly when they are
m any sort of condition, Quan Tart has troops of
admirers for the Epsom, in which he has 7st. 101 b.
After many gloomy days, Melbourne
punters enjoyed themselves at Moonee Valley on
Saturday; three favorites and a second favorite
were successful out of seven events. The Gellibrand
Hurdle proved a soft thing for T. M. Burke’s Spear-
head gelding Bombard, who, backed from 20 to 1
to 6 to 1 (he was favorite at that figure), won by
five lengths from Autrolite (8 to 1) and Nelanji'e
(/ to 1), with old Roiscl, who finished well, fourth.
Bombard is not engaged in Saturday’s big Caulfield
Hurdle, unfortunately for Burke. A great finish
in the Lindsay Gordon Steeple resulted in Grimaldi
(8 to 1) getting the verdict by a short head from
Yellow Mountain (15 to 1) ; Master Mariner (2 to
1), who made a bad jump or two, was third.
Grimaldi is by Comedy King—Glenluce, dam of
King of the Forest, Glen Song and Lucy Thrice.
Consistent Three Kings (5 to 2) was untroubled by
his four opponents in the Glen Orla Handicap, l'j
mile, little Sundae (8 to 1) giving him most
cheek; and Red Page (Duke of Melton—lnky Way)
had just as easy a time in the first division of the
Welter, for which the well-named chestnut was
favorite at 3 to 1. Clan Robert was most in demand
for the Jumpers’ Flat, but he failed to get into the
money; Arroya (8 to 1) won very impressively from
Royal Buzz (10 to 1) and Woolpack (14 to 1),
with Minteme a close fourth.
Arroya, who is by Aryan—Lariat, has 9st. 81b.
in the Australian Hurdle, a race generally won by
a nine-stoner, although Roisel got home with list.
21b. in 1924 —he will have lib. less on Saturday.
This page selects Arroya, with Scourie (lOst. 21b.)
next best. Clan Robert (list. 71b.) will probably
start favorite, but it is no advantage to a horse to
go from hurdling to steepling and back to hurdling,
as the fate of Dungan proved.
* * * *
“Undina”: As far as my knowledge goes,
the record weight humped by a successful steed in
Australia is I7st., which was carried by Torpedo at
a meeting near Richmond (N.Q.). He conceded
more than 6st. to every other horse in the race and
won hands down.
* * * *
The Marquis of Douglas and Dlydesdale
has a good punch, but he is by no means a skilled
boxer. At a charity show at the Sydney Stadium,
to the delight of many squealing flappers, he stopped
an opponent named Tom Dunne in a round ; but in
a second bout he couldn’t land ’em on Tom Finlay
who was 71b. lighter and nearly 20 years older, and
was adjudged to have lost on points. Though Tom,
according to a thick-eared spectator, hadn’t had a
PARRAKEETA LAYS OUT ITS LINKS.
glo\e on since ’ees last grandchild wuz born,” he
gave a capital display and was clearly entitled to the
\ei’dict. Brancourt, the Bankstown (N.S.W.) giant,
who is l 3 in. short of 7ft. and scaled 17st. 61b., was
knocked out in a round and a half by Eddie Eagan,
America.n Rhodes Scholar, but it was barbarous
ot the crowd to hoot him as it did. Eagan is a
good man who would beat any Australian professional
now in the business.
* * * *
Teddy Murton, who made Ids Australian
debut at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday, polished
off stumpy little “Midget” liilburn in three rounds,
lhe natty Briton scaled exactly 9st. ; the American
a pound heavier. Kilburii goes in for stiff swings with
alternate arms, and has no defence beyond a jumpy
footwork designed to carry him out of reach of the
counter—if he’s lucky and the other fellow has the
speed of a steam-roller. He went at the English
lad intent on sweeping him off the stage, but was
met by a fast orthodox attack, principally a jolting
jab to the face; and it was a chastened little
Americanised Italian who faced Murton for the third
stanza. His wild swings were now ducked, side-
stepped or back-moved ; he was hit from every-angle ;
and .lust before the end of the session, as he tried
a vain forward movement, Murton chipped him fair
on the point with the right. It was a clean knock-out
* * » *
Melbourne is so crazy about wrestling these
times that when Stanislaus Zbyszko (16st. 21b.)
opposed Mike Yokel (12st. 121 b.) there was a huge
crowd at the Stadium, although it was a beast of a
night. And great was the cheering when Mike
advanced, and, taking the huge mass of Pole on
his shoulders, twirled it around in his aeroplane
spin. But Stanny was too strong for the lighter
and more agile man, and, after five rounds of
spectacular wrestling, pinned the Yank with a
double arm-lock and back heave. It was the only fall
so it decided the issue.
.Though the Indian Army hockey team,
which met Victoria’s best at Richmond on Saturday,
is reputed to be a world-beater, it was anybody’s
game Aye minutes before time. Heavy rain enveloped
the first half, and the Victorians showed themselves
better at toboganning. Fred Besley, the Australian
back, destroy ed attack after attack of the Indians;
* irminger, the goalkeeper, massacred many potential
goals with lightning swiftness; and Percy Farmer,
the Uni. forward, was brilliant but unlucky. On
the other side, Captain Belchamber was a frequent
and enchanting spectacle, with the sturdy Dhian
Ohand as an attentive batman. Just before the finish
■“* ~ unn » f or home team, made things equal.
Then the Indians found some magic in the bottom
of the bag, and in four minutes, though the field
was like a mud slide, added three goals—-7 to 4.
In the whole tour of M.L. and Australia, only 28
goals have been scored against the visitors’ tally
of 224.
The most aggrieved philanthropist in
Melbourne on Saturday was the old chap who tried
to distribute among the Indians free packets of a
new sweetmeat a local firm is pushing on the market
To his bewilderment, the brown sports, who had
been given beds at the Victoria Barracks, but who,
on account of caste and religion, brought cooks
and food with them, courteously but unanimously
turned him down. “Musta thought we wanted to
poison ’em,” was one spectator’s comment. Inci-
dentally, the Sikhs in the party get over the religious
prohibition against removing their headgear by
twisting a miniature red turban round a few wisps
of. hair on top of their skulls. Before they invented
this rather humorous-looking device, teams used soon
to be enveloped in unravelled turbans, and the goal-
keeper was usually found to be engaged in re-wrapping
the 30 yards or so of colored cotton that had broken
loose from the cranium of the back left.
* * * *
When time was called in the fourth Test
match the scores were Australia, 335; England, 305
for 5 wickets. While all four games have been
inconclusive and resultless, the Cold Country may
perhaps claim to have had a shade of advantage on
Points. One of the many ways and the simplest of
all that have been suggested for eliminating draw's
is to make the first innings the deciding factor when
the game cannot he played out. If this system had
been adopted for the present series the second Test
would have gone to England, which replied to Aus-
tralia s 383 with 475 for 3 wickets. The third would
have been Australia’s with a first innings of 494
against- one of 294. (The first must be dismissed
from all calculations, for not a wicket fell.) In
the fourth England certainly looked like having the
better of it on first hands if the game had gone a
little further. In all three games our men had
whatever advantage there is in first knock.
On the fifth Test, which is to be played out, how-
ever long it takes, and oil the methods adopted by
both sides in playing it, there will depend something
more than the rubber, namely, whether the innovation
(in England) of a first-class match without a time
limit will be approved or condemned, whether it will
set a precedent for future tours or disclose itself as
an experiment to be shunned. With two strong
batting sides meeting on a batsman’s wicket, or with
incessant interruptions necessitated by the weather,
and with no bowler in either team of outstanding
merit, there is no telling how long a game on which
so much hangs may be strung out. On tbe other
hand it is of course possible that the bowling may
get the upper hand for a change. If it doesn’t, the
movement for “no time limit in Test matches’’ is
quite liable to get more of a set-back in England
from one decisive match, however it goes, than it
has got from four undecided ones.
Meanwhile, no county except Yorkshire, early in
the tour, has ever looked dangerous to the tourists,
and most have been made to look remarkably cheap.
Surrey cut a poor figure in the return game at the
Oval, where the weather made a large hole in the
playing time. Bardsley won the toss; Woodfull
(156) and Ryder (104) had most to do with piling
up the respectable total of 432 when the innings
was closed with one wicket to fall. Taylor and
Grimmett helped with 43 and 24; Peach, with 4
wickets for 81, was the most successful of seven
bowlers. The county in its brief period of batting
lost 6 wickets for 82; Grimmett took 4 of them.
Hobbs failed for once and so did Sandham, a rare
experience for both in their own back yard. Rain
prevented any play on the third day.
Glamorgan is the baby of the first-class counties.
It was only admitted to the coveted circle five
Years ago, and stayed at the tail of the procession
until the present season. But this year it has placed
some sensational wins to its credit, and, helped in
some degree by meeting more powerful cricketing
shires when they were shorn of some of their
strength by Test or trial games, is well up among
the leaders. Hence much enthusiasm at Swansea,
which doubtless glowed brighter than ever when half
an Australian side (sans Macartney, Gregory and
Oldfield) had been dismissed for 134. If the later
batsmen hadn’t given Ponsford more assistance, the
total would never have reached 283. But it was
largely a one-man innings at that, with just over
half the runs coming from the bat of the young
Victorian, who carried it through the innings. The
next highest score was 26 from Ellis. Mercer took
5 wickets for 76.
The county batsmen, when their turn came, could
do no more than avert the follow-on with a total
u an d Turnbull, the latter a young* Cam-
bridge Blue, scored 42 apiece, but the rest went
down like skittles before Mailey (5 for 40) and
Grimmett (4 for 56). In their second innings
Austraha lost 5 wickets for 123; then Woodfull
(49 n. 0.) and Bardsley (38 n. 0.) put 200 on the
board and the innings was closed. The Taffies, with
4 wickets down for 50, were in so hopeless a
position on Tuesday morning that there were earnest
prayers for rain.
* * * *
League football furnished its usual quota
ot torm-reversal in Sydney on Saturday, the biggest
surprise being the defeat of University by Balmain
Uni. has had the best season of its career and Bal-
main the worst, but on their own ground at Birch-
grove, the ’Mains won a fast, if ragged, game by
19 points to 2, their success being due chiefly to
hi. Robinson, behind the pack, veteran “Chook”
eraser, at centre, and Latta, in the forwards. A
dreary and occasionally ferocious game between
Eastern Suburbs and Newtown went to East, 18 to 8 ■
North Sydney trounced the uneven Glebe XIII, 15
tO , .H 1 ,? nd unhappy St. George, which is already
anticipating an addition to its fine collection of
wooden spoons, was squelched by Western Suburbs,
to 1-. The Rugby Union had to resume club
matches without a lot of the men who figured against
the All Blacks. Randwick defeated University in
B ' am , u b - v 27 to 21. Randwick’s pack was
the better, and Towers played so well at centre as
to deepen the mystery of his omission from the
second and third games against M.L. Sheehan was
the shining light of the ’Varsity side. Soccer fol-
lowers saw Annandale-Leichhardt knocked out of the
Gardiner Cup by Holmesville, a Newcastle team,
which scored 6 goals to 3 ; and under Aussie rules
the leaders, Eastern Suburbs, were beaten by Wests,
who kicked 14—10 (94 points) to 12—12 (84 points)’.
* * * *
The 1926 All Blacks won four of their
five games in N. S. Wales, but in every instance,
particularly in the last—scores, 28 to 21—=-they had
to go all out for victory. N. S. Wales played
piactically a second XV in the fifth game, and it
beat the visitors in every department save weight
in the forwards. Little Duncan, the N.S.W. half-
back, overshadowed the rest of the 30 players. On
this season’s form N.S.W. should have no apprehension
about the British tour next season. The visitors
scored 102 points against 82 —a poorer showing than
on any other tour.
* * * *
The Australian code of football is, in spite
of a steady growth of Soccer, the only thing that
r< ' a ",y s‘°ves the public and gets the big gates, outside
p .: . , a l. ps and Queensland; and the premiership
ot it is being carefully organised by the other
"hi ee mainland States. South Aus. won a
hard game in Melbourne; and then, at home, beat
the »estralians, who would probably have won if
only their forwards could have shot straight. In
i-u,’ ? re-organised forward line, Jarrahland
dished Victoria in two close games. The S A XVIII
took on the returning Victorians last Saturday on
ihe Adelaide Oval, and had a lead of 7 points at the
end of the first quarter, but failed ingloriously after
that The Victorians closed with IT goals 16 be-
lunds to 4 goals 5 behinds.
* * * *
The 20,000 persons who pushed into the
Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday might have
Hen a fair football match between Victoria and
Tasmania but for a heavy downpour that turned the
first quarter into a mud scramble and the rest of
the game into a burlesque. The Cabbage Gardeners
have got used to mud this season, but .the Apple
Islanders never found their feet or their game or
their marking capacity or anything. Tassie has at
tunes put up some great struggles against Vic., but
this wasnt one of them; even the four ex-Vic.
stars they included seemed to have forgotten ali
they ever knew. At the end they had 5 goals 11
behinds to Victoria’s 15 goals 13 behinds. and the
damp crowd wandered home feeling sorry it hadn’t
stopped by the fireside.

“Gregory was suffering from a gumboil, but it
did not affect his driving power.” —Cricket cable.
How oft we fail to realise
That heroism, hidden, lies
Playing its subtle, secret part,
Deep-buried in a bursting heart.
As with that Spartan youth of yore
Who, as we’ve read in schoolboy lore,
Smiled on his Judges grave and grim
While, ’neath his robe, was worrying him
The stolen fox —a nasty cuss
Ami highly odoriferous.
Once more in mind that scene we see,
As gallant Mr. Gregory
Flouts pyorrhoea’s pangs intense,
And. clouts the bowling to the fence.
This self-same spirit broke its foes
In Sinai sands and Flanders snows,
Or hurled the Hun’s embattled might
In ruin from St. Quentin’s height,
And still puts ginger in the chest
’Mid all the terrors of a Test.
So, all about us, in our lives,
Though fettered in convention’s gyves,
The urge to do our darndest swells
Triumphant o’er affliction’s spells.
Though he have flat and tender feet,
Brown’s losing hazards are a treat;
Astigmatism's shadows drear
Cannot keep Bronson from his beer.
While Greasepaint still the boards must tread,
Though suffering from swollen head.
In high resolve, a lesson take
From these who such example make.
What though a sharp, insistent pang
Thrill James at thought of Mr. 1 ang,
And Bill gets grumpy as (he deuce
When someone mentions Stanley Bruce.
K’en politicians have their day,
And pass, like vial de mer, awa.v.
Till then, put on the guise, of mirth,
And play the game for all it’s worth.

Died lately at Broken Hill, Harman
Montfort Needham, who did some excellent
work in his day. Years ago his humorous
sketches under the pen-name of “Paddy
Melon” were a feature of the Adelaide
Observer ; and Bulletin readers knew
him as “Fitful.” He was an uncle ot
another occasional Bulletin contributor,
Sydney Partrige.
The current issue of the Australian
Museum. Magazine has a special interest
for Bulletin “Abo.” page readers. In it
the problem of the birth and transference of
the baby marsupial to the pouch, which lias
agitated so many of this family journal s
paragraphists, is fully dealt with by E. Be
G. Troughtou. His description of the advent
of the baby ’roo is well illustrated with
clear photographs.
After being assistant publicity officer in
the Vic. railways for 12 months, Boy Gol-
lan takes over the £6OO-odd-a-year job of
Government Tourist Officer, in succession
to J. C. Boyce. Gollan, who is 34, was
formerly political reporter to the Argls
and Evening Sun, and was sub-editor on
the latter sheet when it passed, out. Clapp
is now making noises with a view to secur-
ing another journalist for publicity woik.
The job is worth £5BO a year.
“Hamer” : Some members of the staff of
the S. M. Herald recall with joy the
midnight when a stranger arrived with a
portentous air and a demand to see the
editor-in-chief. A tactful adjutant took him
in hand and he then, guardedly inquired if
the Herald was prepared to pay for exclu-
sive news. Even when assured that it was,
he was disinclined to part with the treasure
in his keeping until given a guarantee that
his information would not be used without
payment. “A baby was born in our house
this evening; I am the father,” he proudly
announced at last.
The poor but practical editor and proprietor
of a Sydney Chinese paper, now extinct, de-
vised a method of attracting advertisers. His
offer was to accept payment for space in the
goods his customers advertised. The scheme
had a certain appeal and his office was
littered continually with cases of jams, tinned
meats, boot polish, toilet requisites and other
articles, which he sold as occasion offered;
but there was occasionally a burst of indig-
nation from advertising canvassers, new to
the game, when the genial Chinaman wanted
to pay their commission in soap. The credi-
tors finally wound up the concern and were
troubled in mind about what had become of
all the goods ; in fact, the tangle in which
the mixed trading became involved was never
completely unravelled.
“Hamer”: In a Sydney newspaper office
the tale is being told of a conscientious editor
who was much exercised over an item from
Newcastle. The Coal City had been holding
carnival, and the usual follies attached to
such an event were mentioned in the report.
A sub-editor, sent for in haste, found his
chief surrounded by volumes of Burke,
“Who’s Who” and other reference-books.
“There must be something wrong with this
man’s copy,” complained the chief. “His
report mentions a reception given to the dis-
tinguished visitors Lord and Lady Nobbys,
but I can’t find that Lord Nobbys has any
existence.” The humble artisan who repre-
sented himself as the lord of the rock-heap
which acts as sentinel to Newcastle Harbor
little knew what trouble his title was going,
to give.
The Triad and the Theatre, two fairly
long established Sydney monthlies, have been
threatened with funerals. Bayertz (now
managing editor of the Sydney Sunday
Times), started the Triad as a magazine
of culchaw in Maoriland, and afterwards
brought it to Sydney. He was the first man
in Australia to chase advts. in a motor-car,
and with that and the help of Frank Morton
on the literary side, by following the Ameri-
can Smart Set model and flinging a liberal
smattering of French into his pages, he
succeeded in convincing quite a number of
people that to buy the Triad was to give
evidence of a well-tilled mind. L. L. Wool-
acott, the most recent editor, failed to main-
tain the old cult, and ‘he paper was lately
advertised for sale by the liquidators. Wool-
aoott has bought it and will run it on new
lines. The Theatre, which was placed on
the map by Frank Hill (once lieutenant to
John Norton) and Lalla Fisher, has fallen
into such a decline that its present pro-
prietors are abandoning the old name as
valueless. It will continue as Just It, but
in a new form.
“Sixenate”: At one time Broken Hill pre-
ferred a strike to a breakfast, but the ex-
perience of doing without breakfast now"
and -then has sobered it. At all events the'
printing staffs of the local papers (one of
them union-owned) got no loud cheers from
the Industrial Council when they proposed
the other day to go on strike. The trouble
first threatened in 1924, when the union put
in a demand for increased pay on account
of having to live in Broken Hill. An agree-
ment was entered into by which the men
agreed to remain at work and accept the
decision of the Arbitration Court as to what
the wages should be. The Court’s decision,,
which failed to give much benefit in the
Silver City, where exceptionally good con-
ditions had already been secured, did not
please the men, who proposed to ignore the
award and demand 15s. per week extra all
round. The Industrial Council coldly told
the printers to go to the N.S.W. Industrial
Commission if it was not satisfied, and its
advice also conveyed a hint that no more
industrial brawls are wanted in Broken Hill
at present. The papers were, however, un-
able to publish for a few days. During that
period the Miner and Truth produced type-
written sheets that were models of news-
compression.

A rush of changes is to succeed a period of
calm in the Sydney theatres. Saturday night
sees the arrival of “The Best People” at the
Grand Opera House, from which “Our Liz”
disappeared earlier in the week. “Quality
Street” and “The Last of Mrs. Cheyney”
have only another week to run; on Saturday
of next week (14tli) Boueieault will intro-
duce the second play of the Barrie cycle,
“What Every Woman Knows,” at the Royal;
and at the Criterion Renee Kelly changes
over to “The Mask and the Face,” an Eng-
lish version of an Italian play. “The
Climax” may get in a few extra days; the
play has made such a success that, in order
to skim the last possible ounce of cream, the
Dot-Post company, instead of catching the
Ascanius for South Africa in Sydney, will
made a train dash to pick it up in W.A, The
Carrolls bring “The Sport of Kings” to the
Palace on August 21. “No, No, Nanette’s”
closing date is not definitely announced;
when the lady does go “Mercenary Mary”
is to come from Melbourne to the St.
James. Amidst all this theatrical earth-
quake, “Rose Marie,” which had its 100th
performance on Monday, stands on the rock
of good houses at Her Majesty’s.

Sydney is not to see the Gilbert and Sulli-
van operas for some time; they go to M.L.
after the Brisbane season. Incidentally, the
“Katja” co., whose first plans for Brisbane
were spoiled by the Aberdeen train smash,
opens in the northern city on August 21.
Marie Burke is fully recovered; but Claude
Flemming will take the place of the unfortu-
nate Warde Morgan.
** * *
Vociferous approval for its comedians is a
habit with the Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney)
audience, and Clem Dawe, the principal box
of crackers in “The Midnight Frolics,” gets
his full share. The “revue” system of de-
livering the goods will probably soon be the
established plan of vaudeville. With one act
dovetailing upon another, it does away with
the annoyance of the constantly-dropped cur-
tain, and the painful hush that follows an
act’s failure is swamped by the hilarity of a
new turn. The people associated with Clem
Dawe give a lively, swift-moving perform-
ance, in which the best points are provided
by farcical scenes, “Neighbors” being the
best of this week’s assortment.
*❖ * *
Ventriloquist Coram, returned to Sydney
Tivoli, harvests a larger crop of applause
than any other performer. His work is
clean-cut, and when he “throws” his voice
no movement of his throat-muscjps can be de-
tected ; his audiences are particularly pleased
with the back-chat of his dummy Jerry, who
declares that, having been in Australia for
some time, he has got the atmosphere and
refuses to be shouted at. Two of Elsie
Prince’s sisters make an appearance in song
and dance; but, though they work strenuously,
the act is only moderate. A family resem-
blance in legs is very strikin':. Burlesque
comedian Arthur Pond produces matter
which varies between good and merely silly,
Cahill and Brooke and Hilda Nelson provide
acceptable concert items, and the Southern
Plantation Revue supplies the information
that the Eskimos are God’s frozen people.
* * af: Hi
Douglas Fairbanks goes through a whirl
of adventure in “Don Q, Son of Zorro,”
which has replaced “The White Sister” at
Sydney Crystal Palace. In moments of
ease, when he is not leaping over dangerous
gulfs or single-handed tackling half a dozen
swordsmen, he flicks an ember out of a blaz-
ing fire with his whip (he is an artist in the
use of this implement) to light his cigarette.
His exploits, although quite unbelievable, are
entertaining; and Eileen Castles appears
amongst others in a well-arranged prologue.
Harold Lloyd is in “Hot Water” at the
Lyceum, showing his usual capacity for mak-
ing dangerous adventure humorous. “The
Midnight Limited” gives fair support to his
hilarity. Hoyt’s has something special in
“The Enchanted Hill.” The story is an
adaptation of Peter B. Kyne, and therefore
full of swift-moving incident; but it is the
photography which is the picture’s chief
merit. By some means a stereoscopic depth
is given to some of the scenes, and a delicate
color-tinting used now and then adds to their
reality. “A Man Four Square” is the sup-
porting film.
A Hordern Gallery Art show:—
There is a good deal of assurance in the work
of Richard McCann, now showing at the Hordern
Galleries, and the assurance generally is justified.
But sometimes it isn’t. The views of Australian
ooastal scenery, such as that of “Wilson’s Promon-
tory” (No. 18), might be any bits of rock thrusting
into unsatisfactory seas. But there is feeling for
atmosphere in most of the bigger canvases. “Winter
in Goulburn Valley” (No. 4) is particularly good;
so is “Swamp Gums” (No. 3). These, with their
accurate impressions of sunshine, are much superior
to the most ambitious canvas, “Late Afternoon,
Lltham” (No. 1), in which the shadow is unduly
accentuated. The artist fails to grasp the massive-
ness of many of his Australian subjects; his pictures
of French scenes are the best, particularly “French
Houses, Le Pug” (No. 45), and a church looming
impressively in a misty atmosphere. Some smaller
works done in England and Italy are exquisite—-
“Fisherman’s Cottage, Mousehole, Cornwall” (No.
30), is this Showman’s favorite.

That dreadful ticking contrivance known
as a metronome, which young sister plants
on the piano when she practises singing, is
known to all. An unseen trades unionist
armed with a pick was the metronome that
kept time for Chaliapin at his only matinee
at Melbourne Auditorium. The same afflic-
tion has been heard on previous occasions.
In fact, it has been the accompaniment to
every afternoon performance in this concert
hall for a long time. Considering all things,
including the figure charged for admission,
it is time the Taits either had the row
stopped or suspended matinees until the
building operations, or whatever they are,
are completed. Otherwise, this Page advises
music-lovers not to risk their money on day-
light performances. The final appearance
of the basso on Saturday night was an un-
spoiled triumph. A house full to bursting
followed the unfolding of each dramatic item
as easily as the unlettered Siberian peasant
deciphers the pictorial shop-sign of that land.
❖ ❖ Jjs tj:
In Melbourne intellectual drama is-at pre-
sent , only read in schools. “Abie’s Irish
Rose” is an ambassador between America
and Australia at the Princess, though there
would probably be less ill-feeling in some
green-room clubs if the embassy had stayed
at home. “White Cargo” will continue to
misrepresent the tropics in terms of melo-.
drama at the King’s until August 14, when
it will do the same thing at the Royal. This

is to allow “The Sentimental Bloke” to
occupy the King’s. At the Athenaeum Kaai’s
Hawaiian Troubadors will troube as from
Saturday. “Our Liz,” at the Palace, will
display Nellie Bramley in a new musi-
comedy rdle on the same date. “Tell Me
More” is filling His Majesty’s with mirth and
song. This has been said before; but other
things have been said before with less cause.
$❖ * *
Melbourne is sustaining without effort two
Yiddish-American comedies at present, “Give
and Take” having returned and lodged itself
at the Theatre Royal for 14 nights only. This
Aaron Hoffmann farce is refreshingly free
from the burning desire to inculcate a moral
which obsesses “Abie’s Irish Rose,” further
up the town. Roy Rene sees to that. There
are indications that the story, which con-
cerns itself with the endeavor of the workers
to run John Bauer’s canned-fruit factory on
Soviet lines, aimed at being a sermon on
co-operation and profit-sharing. There are
even dark hints that the playwright intended
Albert Kruger, the revolting foreman, to be
a somewhat diabolic person. But Roy Rene’s
interpretation of the foreman aforesaid puts
the large mis-shapen hoof of unreason on
the project and strangles it at birth. The
result is a rib-tickler, somewhat too long-
drawn-out, but containing nevertheless many
amusing moments. Harry Green’s John Bauer
struggles against the sea of Rene’s buf-
foonery and occasionally comes to the sur-
face as a sound piece of character drawing.
** * *
( The Victorian Opera Company’s version of
Toy,” first seen at the Playhouse on
Saturday, proved rather patchy. The scenery
was satisfactory, and the choruses went witli
a swing, but not enough attention had been
paid to the costuming of subsidiary characters,
and the art of make-up was not revealed con-
spicuously. Ida Ashton, as San Toy, sang
well and acted cheerfully. Bessie Banks, who
owns probably the best voice in any musical
show at present in Melbourne, would have
been much more successful as Poppy had
she had more stage experience. The highest
honors went to a very promising soubrette,
Romola Hanstein, who sang and danced
nicely as Dudley, the lady’s maid. “Rhoda
and her Pagoda” was one of her best num-
bers, and the duet “Pretty Little Chinese"
with Mason Wood proved a hit. Mr. Wood,
who was here with Oscar Asche, gave the
show a professional backbone in the role of
Li; and George English’s baton kept the
show together. The season closes on Satur-
day night.

Jim Gerald, Aussie composer-comedian, is
a standing—also falling, rising and leaping
—dish at Melbourne Bijou. It is a pity the
energetic fellow hasn’t a younger, vivider
and more winsome collection of supports,
for his fun is infectious and his original
melody also spreads applause-germs. Squires
and yokels figure in liis present jazzy nonsen-
sicality, entitled “Barebacks.” Some day,
perhaps, he may dredge out of his subcon-
scious an Australian theme and start this
land on the way to being self-contained in
the matter of musical comedy. Grant and
Bates, two bright spots from Darktown;
Prank Rodgers, a remarkable negro ventrilo-
quist, and May Geary, a weird contralto,
are others on a generally-acceptable bill.
*, * *
Frankie Heath, of the husky voice, charms
the hearts of Melbourne Tivoli patrons, and
her turn is usually at least twice as long
as the programme calls for. Cahill and
Brooke, after a successful run, have been
wafted across to Sydney to become head-
liners in Castlereagh-street for a bit. New-
comers include the melodious Monks of St.
Bernard and the bounding Monroes. Athol
Tier and Peggy Ross present some new non-
sense, and the Cockney comedians Osborne
and Perryer are gaining in popularity.
The weather is still cool at Hoyt’s Mel-
bourne emporium, where both Amundsen and
Byrd are making flights across the screen
en route for Polar regions. Between the
icepacks audiences are warming their hands
at Pauline Frederick’s large store of warm
emotions in “Two Kinds of Women.” Elsa
Stralia returns with her great voice to the
Majestic on Saturday; meantime “The Wife
Who Wasn’t Wanted” is silently sacrificing
herself for her wrongfully convicted son ; but
everything comes out right at the end. A
brand-new comedian, Harry Langdon, is call-
ing attention to his antics in the supporting
film.
** * *
Some etchings:—
Australian etchers mix with European practitioners
without loss of face at the Fine Art Society’s
Gallery, Melbourne. Eugene Bejot is light and grace-
ful, and A. Hugh Fisher, A.R.E., is tremendously
concerned with details. Of the local artists Sydney
Ure Smith is, as usual, solidly respectable, though
the old masons weren’t as faulty as the portico of his
Old Treasury, Sydney, makes out. John Shirlow deals
faithfully with Melbourne, but some of his shadows
are too ponderable. Van Raalte’s examples are only
trifles. No definite inspiration takes Victor G. Cobb
by the hand and his foliage is cut out with scissors.
Fred C. Britton’s ‘‘Gaston Mervale” is only a map
of the veteran actor, but his ‘‘Sunlit Homestead” is
light, bright and airy. E. Warner makes a clever
study out of woolpacks on the road to Condobolin,
and J. C. Goodchild, the up and coming Adelaide
man, has a rather uneven panel in which the most
unobtrusive, a delicate impression of St. Peter’s
Cathedral, best repays investigation. J. C. Good-
hard, of Broken Hill, is a new striver who shows
plenty of determination and should develop. A
quartet of Norman Lindsay’s sing their thoroughly
individual note.

Pavlova, who lias been floating about the
stage of Adelaide Royal and defying the
flight of time, shows supreme artistry every-
where, and her trick of doing just the unex-
pected thing has a further charm. The stag-
ing is very fine, and her costuming makes the
conventional ballet-dress look almost ugly
when she assumes it for a change. Novikoff,
acrobat a.s well as dancer, gives splendid
support. So do sundry girls who are rapidly
qualifying as stars on their own account,
notably Thyrza Rogers. At Wondergrapli
Ramon Novarro fights his way (and Alice
lerry s) gallantly through the French Re-
volution, artistic support of Lewis
Stone; the “Scaramouche” season has had
to be still further extended. The York is
prettily sentimental with “Memory Lane,”
the Pav. thrilling with a fire-brigade drama,
and West’s has an unlikely but stagily-effec-
tive yarn of a Ruritanian monarch in the
U.S.A., “King on Main Street.”
’A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Lalla Miranda was the
heroine of an incident at the salon of the
Comtesse Henri de Grassot in Paris last
month. A musical programme had been
arranged, and the Australian was the star
soprano of the occasion. At the last moment
the famous. Russian pianist Podolsky was
unable to appear and the Australian prima
donna offered to be his deputy. In a most
brilliant manner she played a group of classic

and modern selections to the delight and
astonishment of those present. As a matter
of fact Busoni wished to bring her out as a
pianist and spoke of her technique as excep-
tional.
“Wood’s Green”: Andre Skalski, whose
work with the N. S. Wales State Orchestra
was remarkable for one so young, has cov-
ered a fresh field at Cannes and Nice with
his piano recitals. He has also scored suc-
cess as a translator. He and Mervyn Bond
supplied the English version for Eugen
dWlbert’s opera, “Die Abreise,” and with
Kingsley Lark, whose family are well known
in Sydney, he did similar work for Haydn’s
“Der Apotheker,” Mozart’s opera-bouffe
“La Finta Giardiniera,” and Julius Bittner’s
one-act opera “Das Holliscli Gold.” From the
critical Saturday Review (London) Skal-
ski and Kingsley Lark received the follow-
ing compliment: “They have made full use
of the genius of the English tongue for
amusing rhymes, and their translation is re-
freshingly free from most of the idiocies
which appeared at one time inseparable
from opera in English.”
“Bill Ding” : Australia sends tons of gold
to America for pitchers, and apparently it
is to be denied even the poor chance of re-
taining a few ounces for an occasional
scenario. AWestralian posted a film story to
Hollywood. Back it came with a note to the
effect that, “on account of accusations of pla-
giarism,” the cahmp’ny had decided to accept
no more MSS. or printed matter from Britain
or British Dominions, and to confine its out-
put to American “works.” There would be
none of this boycotting if Australia had a
proper tariff; on the contrary, cahmp’nies
would be falling over one another to estab-
lish studios here and buy Australian brains.
“Shelbourne”: Oscar Wilde’s “For Love
of the King” has just been published
in America for the first time, and, described
as a Burmese masque, is under considera-
tion for production in London. It will pro-
bably be given a private Sunday-night per-
formance by a repertory eo., and on that
trial will depend its transfer to a West
End theatre. As it consists of a number
of short scenes, the staging will not be
lightly entered on. The work has always
been surrounded with mystery: it was re-
ported to have been stolen in manuscript
from Wilde’s house in Tite-street at the time
of his tragic eclipse.

“Centurion”: The fuss being made over
the filming of “The Term of His Natural
Life” makes me wonder why producing firms
don’t avoid such controversial matter as the
convict system and the Kelly gang. If the old
Australia, and not the new, is to be pic-
tured, what is the matter with “Geoffrey
Hamlyn”? Kingsley’s novel, incomparably
the best depiction of the golden age of pas-
toral Australia, is full of human types that
have long since passed off our stage. Set
in the fine scenery of the Snowy River, the
story contains plenty of stirring action, some
seemly and justifiable bloodshed and humor
that is lively and clean. The English chap-
ters furnish an admirable prologue, and for
a gripping semi-finale there’s police-
inspector Desbo rough’s relentless pursuit of
George Hawker up through the snows of
Kosciusko.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : On the night of
Melba’s farewell at Covent Garden, Violet,
Duchess of Rutland, who is to paint a por-
trait of Pamela, the prima donna’s grand-
daughter, sat next George Armstrong in a
box. Another occupant was Lady Juliet
Duff, the only child of the late Lady de Grey
(Marchioness of Ripon), who played a large
part in establishing Melba when she first
came to London. Lord de Grey was then
a director of Covent Garden, and as he was
Treasurer of the Queen’s Household, he and
his wife wielded an influence which was in-
valuable to Melba. The tension of the even-
ing, as everyone was preparing to shed
tears, was broken when Lord Stanley of
Alderley (formerly Governor of Vic.), in
alluding to Melba’s activities, used the word
“outcast” instead of “broadcast,” and in a very
unhappy connection. The audience yelled
with laughter.
“C. Ockney”: When Allan Wilkie starts
business with the Bard again in Australia he
intends to put on “Henry VIII.,” which has
not been seen here since G. V. Brooke’s day. If
on his present trip to England he is suc-
cessful in acquiring the scenery and dresses
used by Sybil Thorndike in her revival of
the play at London Empire, he will have done
a fine stroke of business. That production
was lauded as “exquisite.”
“Curtain Riser”: I don’t altogether agree
with “Caul Boy” (B. 29/7/’26) re the Nat.
Anthem. It serves as a useful, if not very
melodious, hint to audiences that the show
is over. But if a great visiting artist pre-
fers to provide another sort of full stop,
why worry? Anyhow, why attach “God
Save” to concerts in particular? Lots
of people go to anthemless art exhibitions
without being accused of fostering sedition.
“Curtain Raiser”: I am all in favor of
some measure of control of showmen who
exploit child labor, a subject brought up by
the National Council of Women in B risbane,
There would be very little loss dramatically
if the kids were prohibited altogether. The
playwright who insists on dragging juveniles
into his script should be discouraged first
of all, and then the producer would have less
excuse for exploiting infants in his turn.
Not long ago a highly-strung youngster was
boomed in Melbourne for a feat of histrionic
endurance. She appeared in the prologue
at one playhouse, and was then run around
to another to take part in a pantomime.
Both shows had a fairly long run, with
plenty of matinees. It was a great exploit,
no doubt, but I’m glad it wasn’t done by any
child of mine.
“Nero”: Norman MacOwan, who plays
the small part of the Waterloo veteran in
“Quality Street” at Sydney Royal, is some-
thing of a literary gent. One of his books,
“The Infinite Shoeblack,” has been in great
demand at local libraries; it was originally
written in play form. MacOwan has written
several plays, one of which, “Jacob’s Ladder,”
was produced at London’s Little Theatre.
“Hamfat”: The late Ella Carrington (B.
22/7/’26) probably saw more townships of
Australasia than any other actress of her
time. The by no means expensive co. with
which her name was for so many years
associated probed the prospects of the small-
est hamlets. Discussing a projected Maori-
land tour with an advance agent who knew
the roads well, I put my finger on a fair-
sized blot on the map. The advance shook
his head. “Too small?” I asked. “Much too
small!” he retorted. “Why, the Taylor-
Carringtons haven’t been there 1”
“Quiz”: The Queen’s Theatre, in Queen-
street (Melb.), the first brick building of
its kind erected in that city, is being demol-
ished to make room for a motor-garage. If
was opened 83 years ago with “Black-eyed
Susan.” George Coppin leased it later, pro-
ducing “The Lady of Lyons” and similar
plays, and the ghost walked regularly. A
Shakspearean season followed with satis-

in the dark.”
factory results. Living in the Old Colo-
nists’ Home, founded by George iCoppin,
Mrs. J. P. Ilydes, widow of a favorite com-
edian who trod the stage of the Queen’s in
1884, vivaciously recalls memories of the
early history of the old playhouse. The
theatre stood on land measuring 70ft. by
165 ft. It has long been used as a store.
“Alastor”: “Greenhide,” the second pro-
duction of the Queensland co. which filmed
“The Moth of Moonbi,” will, it is expected,
be ready in October. The early scenes arc
laid in the picturesque Dawson Valley,
where 7000 ft. have been exposed. Some
further outdoor scenes will be “shot” at Cun-
ningham’s Gap, and the finishing touches
will be put on the story—producer Charlie
Chauvel wrote it himself —at the Brisbane
studio. Elsie Sylvaney is playing lead with
Bruce Gordon, and among the supports are
Irma Dearden and Jules Murray Prior.
“C. Ockney”: That excellent comedian
John Kirby did a good thing for himself
when he went to London. He was immedi-
ately snapped up for a revue at the Lyceum,
which, however, failed to click. But man-
agers had noted John’s ability and he was
soon in harness again. For the last six
months he has been at the Palladium, play-
ing twice a day in a concoction called “Pal-
ladium Pleasures,” in which Lorna and
Toots Pounds are the stars.
“Yarra Ben”: The Chosen Race is having
a gala time on the Melbourne boards. One
theatre has Harry Green and Roy Rene sup-
plying Israelitish impersonations in “Give
and Take” ; at another “Abie’s Irish Rose”
is Hebrew with a dash of Irish. Some play-
goers suggest it is a case of “Too-Jews per-
drix.”
“Bill O’O.”: Every time I read gibes at
Grainger for neglecting Beethoven in his
programmes I am filled with misgiving. All
the famous piano-<ticklers I have listened
to in Australia since Charles Halle’s day
displayed their acquaintance with the great
deaf genius by rattling off his third-rate (for
him) “Anger Over the Lost Penny.” If
Percy hasn’t got the “Moonlight,” the “Wald-
stein,” the “Pathetique” and a few others of
that glorious company in his portfolio I
hope I shall not hear Beethoven via his fingers,
because I have a presentiment that I shall
only be given once more that tiresome annoy-
ance over the missing copper, and I won’t
thank Bulletin writers for having stimu-
lated him to that effort. I shall only be
stimulated to anger over my lost half-guinea
at the box-office.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : An illiterate Italian
farmer in California proposed by letter to
a young girl to whom he w/is unknown, but
who had waited on him in a San Francisco
cafe. His young farm-assistant, Joe, wrote
the fateful letter, and the farmer (Tony),
in order to make the offer more attractive,
enclosed Joe’s photograph instead of his own.
The girl (Amy), weary of the caf6 drudgery
and anxious for a home, accented. On the
day of her arrival Tony met with a serious
motor accident and Joe had to meet her at
the station. She recognised him as the original
of the photograph, and decided the prospect
was not unpleasant. Joe innocently failed
to clear the situation. Later in the day,
when Amy found herself married to an elderly
cripple, a revulsion of feeling set in. The
wedding festa was duly celebrated, the
crippled bridegroom being unable to take
part. Amy was thrown into the arms of
Joe and three months later she knew she
was to bear Mm a cMld. In the interval
she had learned to love her husband, and she
and Joe decided to make a full confession to
the lovable Tony. How he forgave her and
decided to protect Joe’s child -provide big
scenes in a new play, “They Knew What
They Wanted,” at St. Martin’s, which is
marked by great sincerity, fine characterisa-
tion and moving situations. The piece is
the work of a young Harvard graduate,
Sidney Howard. He and the chief actors all
received quite extraordinary ovations.
“Peter Pan”: Gladys Unger’s comedy
“The Goldfish,” produced for the first time
in Australia by Muriel Starr’s co. at Hobart,
had a more encouraging reception than the
last Unger play seen here. That piece
frosted immediately, although it ran for
hundreds of nights in London. It was “Lon-
don Pride,” done at Melbourne Royal some
years back with Percy Marmont (now on
the fillums) in Gerald du Maurier's part.
“Whiteway” : George Gershwin, the. jazz
king, whose latest production is an ambitious
concerto with a Charleston beat, studied com-
Eosition under Ernest Hutcheson, of Mel-
ourne, whom Dr. Torrance helped to pilot
into an important musical job in America.
The concerto, performed by the New York
Symphony Orchestra under Damrosch, re-
ceived such high praise that the former
Melbourne boy is entitled to a fair share of
the artistic glory.
“D’wynn”: Mention of the Wellington
(M.L.) Repertory Theatre movement (B.
15/7/’26) reminds me that Prof. Shelley,
of Canterbury ’Varsity College, is fondling
a scheme for the production of the sort of
plays which leg-show managements do not
provide. He suggests that a thousand people
in each of the four main towns should sub-
scribe a guinea apiece to establish a national
society, which would engage a small stock
company to cover the main parts in an
approved list of plays, filling up with
amateurs. The pros, would travel to each
town in turn. With a permanent stock, the
Prof, argues, the standard of production
would be so raised that the public would
find itself going to good plays because it
liked them, instead of languidly patronis-
ing them on the theory that “one really
ought to go, y’know.”
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Lady Susan
Birch organised a performance of The
Merry Wives of Windsor” for a charity, and
herself appeared as Mistress Page when the
show was given at the Scala Theatre. She
has been a good deal in the limelight. W hen
in Australia liberal illumination came her
way, first as the guest of Melba and later
when she played Lady Teazle to the Sn
Peter of Cyril Maude, who, by the way, is
shortly to have a farewell season under the
direction of the Shubert brothers. Lady
Susan’s great-grandmother, Louise, Countess
of Craven, was a great actress. Her uncle,
the Hon. Alex. Yorke, who was an equerry
to Queen Victoria, was also an accomplished
amateur, and when he visited Australia as
the guest of Sir Henry Loch many thought
he had forgotten to remove the grease-paint
from his very rosy cheeks. F'or Melba s fare-
well at Covent Garden Lady Susan fashioned
a bouquet of shell-flowers, in the making of
which she is an adept.
“R.K.D.N.”: When “White Cargo” was
originally done in London the part of the
young Englishman who marries the dusky
Tondeleyo was played by Brian Aherne.
Brian’s rendering was praised by the critics,
but I should judge he is more at home in the
clean atmosphere of the Barrie plays.
“R.K.D.N.”: Various people in Melbourne
are barracking for a National Theatre to be
erected at Canberra. A question was re-
cently put in the Senate on the subject, but
nothing is likely to come of it. If the
Yorks yearn for a show while they are at
’Berra, they will have to put up with pic-
tures. There will be no lack of them: a
Sydney syndicate is building a £20,000
“palace” on a site which it has leased for
£7OOO.
“Cmsar’s Ghost”: The Sydney G.P.O.
doesn’t require to be told where Poverty
Point is. A telegraph messenger arrived at
the Criterion corner the other day, and,
showing a wire addressed to a mummer at
“Poverty Point, Sydney,” asked a bunch of
actor-rs he found loitering there if they knew
the bloke. The bloke happened to be one ot
the bunch, and through the wire he got a
job in the country.
“Caul Boy”: The remarkable popularity
in Melbourne of “The Best People,” the
American dialect play, in which the only
non-Yankee personage is an imbecile English
nobleman, is a good indication of how far
the Americanisation of this country has
gone. The same play is being shown in
London, but apparently it was too foreign
for the Cockney. The only character that
was allowed to remain American was Milly,
the primitive light-of-love chorus-girl.
“Emer”: “Feng-Shui” (B. 8/7/’26) looses
an intolerant sneer at Leon Gordon’s W hite
Cargo.” The trouble is that the theat”?
demands such sustained and intense action
as to unfavorably affect the mind of a man
who has that atmosphere for his daily life.
How absurdly just stage-justice must appear
to a Judge! Who has ever achieved such
unselfish heroism as the stage hero? These
critics, who cavil at detail, show how trivial
they are. One is reminded of O. Henry s
hero who poisoned himself with tincture ot
aconite. “Tincture of aconite,” said Stephen
Leacock, “may be poisonous and it may not.
It sounds poisonous and that is enough jor
us.” Only to the apothecary is the question
one for consideration.
“St. John’s Wood” (Lond.) : The .present
opera season at Covent Garden has been
made possible largely by the financial sup-
port of the Courtauld family, which has
made many millions in the artificial silk
business. Two members of this cultured
family spent some time in Australia —Miss
Ellen Courtauld, the first honorary secre-
tary of the Austral Salon, Melbourne, and
her sister, Mrs. Arthur Bendy, whose hus-
band was a member of Melbourne TJni. staft.
“Hamfat”: In the process of making his
second movie, Australia’s 17-year-old filmer,
George Palmer, has been giving Melbourne
thrills. Stunt artist as well as producer, he
figured in a motor-car race with one of
Clapp’s trains and a dash across the front
of the oncoming engine, with only a couple
of feet to spare; in a leap from a tunnel on
to a moving train and an adventure on timber
trucks, which ran down a grade and toppled
over a trestle bridge. Though careless of his
neck, the young adventurer has a business
head. He retains all rights in his pictures,
has registered under the company law of two
countries, and has opened a branch office in
Auckland to look after his affairs in the
Windy Isles.
OF CHEESES AND KINGS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘That’s just how I like it —nice and green,
said King George, beaming over a cheese at the
Koval Agricultural Show. ‘But,’ said the Queen,
‘it is bad for you like that. It is full of animals.
You have heard a diva singing
Silver rapture for the gods,
And a king, no doubt, a-kinging
You have seen; but lengthy odds
I have ready for the laying
You’ve nor heard nor witnessed these —
For her food that songstress braying,
Nor a monarch with his cheese.
It may trouble you or please,
Rob a throne, maybe, of voodoo,
When you learn a king likes cheese
“Nice and green,” as I and you do.
Sight of regal pomp and glory
May have made your pulses thump,
But it’s quite another story
When the cheese begins to jump;
Oh, from Windsor then to Mulga
There’s a merging of degrees—
Men and mice and kings are vulgar
In the way they like their cheese.
Be phonetic, if you please,
And just put it so: in Blighty
There’s a Sovereign wants his cheese,
Like his kingdom, strong and mite-y.
VICTORIA.
MACESS.

—balance must be ascertained mentally at the
end of the month when the work is the heaviest
—the balance must be worked out for credit
information.
—the accuracy depends entirely upon the clerk—
an error may go undetected for a month or more.
—statements frequently go out late and are
sometimes incorrect
Burroughs-kept Ledgers save
money because
—balance automatically computed and proved
accurate each day—no month-end congestion.
—a proved balance is always ready for instant

We want many Englishmen in South Australia,
Where old England’s flag is our National Regalia,
We want them in hundreds, and thousands by ten,

“Tim Tiki” : Maoriland’s cow champion-
ship is claimed by Gretta, a Friesian cross,
hailing from Mataura. During 294 milking
days of the 1925-26 season she produced
15,1261 b. of milk and 766.531 b. of butter-
fat. Her daily milk average was 51b., test-
ing at 5.08. Five years ago this dairyman’s
dream was saved from the butcher only be-
cause she was in calf.
“The Traveller”: Gippsland is not the
only part of Victoria that is being invaded
by Italians (B. 15/7/’26). Western Vic. is
getting its share. Coleraine and Oasterton
are being provided with a new water supply.
Recently the contractor for the reticulation
of Coleraine imported some Italian work-
men, and as some of the local workers dis-
placed are descendants of families that have
lived in the district since the Hentys settled
hereabouts they feel pretty sore about it.
• * * *
“Tabra”: Radio licenses are selling in
Queensland like hot pies outside the Stadium.
After a batch of prosecutions of wireless out-
laws, 1800 persons fell over one another in
their haste to take out licenses. That was
one week’s record ; the next week produced
a crop of over 1000, bringing the number
of Queensland’s licensed listeners to 12,000.
The great majority of the licenses are for
the metropolitan area; outside Ipswich, the
country areas are very thinly represented.
* * * #
From Dr. Yelland, of North Fitzroy:—
Touching those old metal tokens issued by firms
or individuals in the early days and accepted as
money (B. l/7/’26). They were to be found in
every colony and were legal tender by Government
proclamation up to 1865. In that year their further
use was stopped. Professor Holloway’s was an
accepted token; so was that of J. Taylor, of the Red
House, Ballarat —both being used, of course, for
advertising purposes. If “Huffin Guffin” ■ visits the
Mitchell Library, in Sydney, he will see a fairly
good collection of these tokens. If he can’t do that
he may correspond with me, as I am supposed to
possess the best collection in the world.
* • * * *
“Machete”: Queensland canegrowers are
beginning to realise that the Federal Power
Alcohol Act and the early establishment of two
great power-alcohol distilleries in the North
are going to lift a lot of worry from their
shoulders. The distilleries will use both
molasses and cassava, but the special point
interesting the grower is the possibility of
getting a price for cane at which the mills
would not formerly look. Thus a crop which
would be a dead loss regarded as sugar will
return something for distilling purposes.
Overstanding, burned or frosted cane will
in future be regarded by its owner with a
kindlier eye.
*** . *
“Flittermouse” : It would be interesting to
have a tally of all the aeroplanes under
construction in Australian back yards to-day.
The small-’plane trials at Richmond
(N.S.W.) last year showed that a number
of week-end experts had tackled the problems
of design and construction, one or two even
planning and making their own engines. The
latest to be heard of is George Murray, a
Goulburn engineer, who has just finished
a monoplane at a cost of £lOO. The breaking
of a fitting the other day postponed the
trials, but the inventor-builder reckons his
18-h.p. engine can keep him up for a two
hours’ trial at 70 m.p.h. The machine
weighs under 2501 b. and has a 20-foot wing
span. One can almost hear the aerial taxi
in the distance.
* * * *
“Krakukides” : The Greek Government is
talking of leasing lovely Corfu, in the
lonian Islands, to a syndicate, which pro-
poses to run a gambling casino there, in
opposition to Monte Carlo. A British garri-
son once occupied Corfu, and the old forts
and naval station are still there, but the
great attraction is the splendid villa once
owned by ex-Ivaiser Bill Ilohenzollern. This
is to be converted into the actual casino. But
I doubt if the brotherhood and sisterhood of
gambling, most superstitious of humans, will
fancy the ominous history of the place. It
was built for the beautiful and unhappy
Empress Elizabeth of Austria, who experi-
enced about every possible spin of bad luck
before she died at the hands of an anarchist
assassin. Then Kaiser Wilhelm bought it,
and what happened to him has just about
put the place’s pot on.
* * * *
“Pakehaha”: Wellington (M.L.), which
badly needs it, is to have its housing pro-
blem tackled by Private Enterprise, Gov-
ernment and municipal efforts having proved
of doubtful value. A co. calling itself May-
fair, Ltd., has acquired an acre on Welling-
ton-terrace, the one-time haunt of the elite,
now the stamping-ground of the apartment-
house keeper. Lambton Quay, the principal
shopping street, built along a strip of re-
claimed foreshore, is within biscuit-toss of
the locality, which is really part of what
was once a sea cliff, against whose foot the
harbor waters lapned. A city of 136 modern
flats is to be erected, grouped round a central
garden-court. If the cost does not exceed the
estimate and the rents are reasonable, the
scheme should be of benefit to the Windy
City’s residents, who are driven to herd too
much in old wooden houses hastily converted
into alleged flats.
* * * *
“Bulimba” : Brisbane’s Water and Sewer-
age Board, finding itself in need of a lot more
money, has decided to levy its rates on im-
provements as well as unimproved land
values. The job of valuing the 53,000
tenements in Greater Brisbane has been
given to M. R. Ilornibrook, president of the
Master Builders’ Association, for a consider-
ation of £42,112. It seems a huge sum, but
Hornibrook undertakes to supply a ground
plan of every building, and all necessary
particulars as to materials, quantities, state
of repair and so on, on which the valua-
tions will be based; also to fight all appeals
at his own expense. He is enlisting/ 300
assistants, and contracts to finish the Work
by Christmas. The Board will then have a
ground plan and particulars of every build-
ing in the metropolitan area. The daily
newspapers (other than the Labor organ)
have suddenly become converted to Georgian
principles, and are urging the Government
to veto the scheme.

The Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Australian Bank of Com-
merce, Limited, was held to-day, Tuesday, 27th July, 1926, at the Banking House, King
and George Streets, Sydney, Sir Mark Sheldon, 1v.8.E., Chairman of Directors, presiding.
In moving the adoption of the Report and Balance Sheet, the Chairman said: —
Ladies and Gentlemen, —Our Balance-sheet again shows substantial progress, with total
figures £16,789,590, being £1,393,654 greater than 12 months previously. The increase is
mainly in Deposits, which stood on 30th June at £12,463,529 —a growth of £1,169,093.
Other figures on the Liabilities side call for little comment, except to remark that
our total liabilities to the public, including the Deposits referred to, stand at £13,829,724:
and that the Reserve Fund, increased by £50,000, has now reached the figure of £790,000.
Assets include Cash and other Balances, etc., of a specially liquid nature, amounting
to £5,986,849, which is equal to almost Bs. Bd. in the £ of our outside liabilities.
Advances at £10,349,003 show increase of £1,210,659 —a strong demand for Bank
Loans having been experienced, latterly. I will refer again to this subject further on.
Bank Premises, after allowing for writing down from profits, now stand at £453,738.
Except where it is unavoidable, it is not the Bank’s policy to invest largely in buildings
—the Board preferring to utilise its resources in meeting as far as possible the require-
ments of customers as regards financial assistance.,
Turning now to the Profits for the year, these amount to £207,943, enabling us—
besides transferring the £50,000 to Reserve Fund as mentioned above —to apply £lO,OOO
in reduction of Bank Premises; and to pay both interim and final dividends at the rate
of 8 per cent, per annum. These dividends absorb £147,200, and there is a small increase
in the amount of £55,-303 to be carried forward.
A Branch of the Bank has recently been opened at Perth, Western Australia —
thus completing a chain of Branches round the coast of the mainland.
Throughout the greater part of Australia serious drought threatened over a period
of some months. In most districts, however, March brought bountiful rains, which have
continued, and the pastoral and agricultural season is promising.
In Central Queensland, however, rain is still lacking, and a condition of serious
drought prevails. Heavy losses have already been sustained in these districts; and there
are as yet no indications of a break.
Notwithstanding the competition of substitutes of greater or less merit, and a trend
of fashion towards materials other than wool, the market for our staple product has been
steady during the year; and a sound range of values has ruled. A substantial balance
of the previous year’s clip as well as the whole of last season’s product have been cleared,
the carry-forward of unsold wpol now being negligible. Thus the forthcoming season
commences with a clean sheet.
As a good lambing is expected in most parts of Australia, a net increase in the
quantity of the Australian Clip is expected, notwithstanding losses in Queensland.
A steady market has ruled for Wheat, but a considerable reduction in the yield has
reduced returns to growers.
The Cattle Market remains in an unsatisfactory condition, and rising costs are
tending to hamper the Meat Export Trade.
Excessive production of Sugar beyond the amount which can be absorbed in Aus-
tralia has resulted in a large surplus for export, for which only world prices can be
obtained. The average price secured by sugar-growers for their total production has
thus been reduced.
Immediate prospects for the sugar-growing districts of Queensland, however, seem
to indicate that, owing to the drought conditions ruling, any surplus beyond Australian
requirements is likely this season to be smaller.
Until the population of Australia is considerably larger, however, any increase in
the acreage devoted to sugar-growing seems undesirable, as the Australian-grown product
cannot compete on the world’s markets owing to our living standards and conditions.
Marked stability has ruled in the Exchange Market during the past 12 months, and
as far as can be seen at the present moment there seems no likelihood of violent fluc-
tuations such as prevailed whilst the Gold Standard was in abeyance.
For some time past Stock Exchange investments have tended to rise. Substantial
amounts of Trust Funds and other moneys of that description have. been available for
high-class investments. Bank advances, however, have been on a different plane; and
the demand, already referred to, has been strong, the growth of Advances having exceeded
that of Deposits.
Development, or, indeed, maintenance, of Deposits must depend upon good seasons,
continuance of high prices for primary products, and, I fear, of the supply of Loan Moneys
from abroad.
Borrowed money should be regarded as producing merely a temporary, and, perhaps,
a fictitious, prosperity, not free from danger, as the public must meet the cost in the
future, both in interest and in capital as it falls due, while if lenders from abroad were
to withdraw their support suddenly or in special time of need, a period of depression
would inevitably follow.
Public borrowing here has been on a high scale ; and the best interests of the future
of the community call for moderation in that regard—both for the reasons indicated, and
lest our Federal and State borrowing demands should outrun the supply of funds likely
to be available to Australia in the world’s somewhat depleted financial markets. Latterly,
indeed, there have been some warnings of such a situation.
iGaution seems specially to be called for at this stage lest development of an unduly
rapid nature may impede the sound and steady progress which achieves most in the
long run.
Every thinking person must realise the fact that our heavy taxation is a strain on
the community. Some remission would be a useful step towards real reduction in the
cost of living called for in the best interests of the community, and to foster an increase
in its producing power, on which its future prospects must mainly depend.
The effect of the curtailment of the hours of work brought about by recent enact-
ments in the State of New South Wales has caused an increased cost of production and
an amount of waste.
The waste more particularly is in the loss of time, for instance, in connection with
our railways in receiving and delivering merchandise entrusted to them. The curtail-
ment of hours under which the railway depots throughout the country operate has thrown
an extra burden on to the trading community, which increases costs to the public.
Further, I am of opinion that the natural result of these shorter hours must be not
only to make the cost of primary products and manufactured goods greater, but ulti-
mately also materially to increase the all-round costs of living.
It is too early yet to express an opinion as to the ultimate effect of the Workers’
Compensation Act; but, apart from more controversial questions, there are undoubted
indications that this Act will press severely on the small employer, especially in the rural
districts in the State of New South Wales.
It will interest you to hear that the number of shareholders of this Bank on 30th
June was 6677, showing an average holding of 275 shares of £1 each. This is an example
of the modern tendency for the small investor to place his capital in large public
companies.
The motion was seconded by Dr. George J. Sly, and carried unanimously.
Dr. G. J. Sly and Mr. Duncan Carson were re-elected Directors and Messrs
William Craig, F.C.P.A., and Milton F. Johnson, F.C.P.A., were appointed Auditors
The Chairman declared the Dividend is now payable.
SPECIAL BUSINESS, which comprised alterations and amendments in the Articles
of Association as advertised, were approved by the meeting. A special meeting to con-
firm same will be held on 13th August.
A Vote of thanks to the Chairman, Directors and Officers was moved by Mr Bern-
brick and carried unanimously.
At a subsequent meeting of the Board Sir Mark Sheldon was re-elected Chairman
ot Directors.

“Bris”: Governor-General Stonehaven,
politely complimented in Brisbane on the
absence of Scottish burr from his speech,
explained (rather mournfully) that this was
due to his English education. “When I go
back to Scotland,” he added, “people com-
plain that I have an English accent.”
Joseph Clarke, one of the volunteers who
helped to bring up Johnson, the sole survivor
of the wreck of the Dunbar, from the rocks
below South Head in 1557, has just died at
Nundle (N.S.W.). He hadn’t been long in
the colony at the time, and soon lit out for
the goldfields, where at one pick-stroke he
knocked out a £7OO nugget.
“Doric": Tasmania is a much worse
offender than the mainland in the matter of
discarding aboriginal names (B. 8/7/’26).
During a tour through the Speck I came
across only two native monikers, Wadda-
manna and Miena, more euphonius and cer-
tainly more distinctive than the English
names that are repeated all over the English-
speaking world.
Jack Morrissey, who ended his connection
with life and Vic. politics lately, got off his
best retort to an interjector in his first elec-
tion campaign. An old fellow who knew
that Morrissey once earned a living as a
laborer at a piggery, yelled out “Go back to
the pigs!” “In those days,” rapped out
Morrissey, “I was a man amongst pigs; you,
sir, are” The audience tumbled.
South Aus. is trying to improve its inland
fisheries, which, apart from the Murray, are
scanty. The Onkaparinga has for years had
a few .nice trout, and now 5000 are on order
from the ponds at Ballarat for release. The
Para, near Gawler, and the Finniss, down
near the Murray mouth, have already been
supplied. Also private owners who have
water —they are not many—are being en-
couraged to apply for young fish; Melrose,
of TTlooloo, is first in the field with an order
for 1000.
“Yamawa”: 1 join issue with “Ancient
Mariner” when he asserts (B. 15/7/’2G)
that the Age and Dibdin are wrong in using
the term “sheer hulk” for a stripped or stark
hulk. Doesn’t he himself confuse “sheer”
with “shear”? During my time on blue
water we always wrote of “shear-legs,” tem-
porary and permanent. I never heard
“sheer” or “shear” hulk used to describe the
floating crane he speaks about, and I was
born in a shipyard, and went to sea ’way
back in "87.
Simon Jacob Englehart Jorgensen, just
dead at McKinnon (Vic.), aged 72, made a
stir in seafaring circles in 1889, when, in
a lifeboat designed by himself, he sailed from
London to Adelaide, accompanied by John
Nilsen as mate. The voyage took nine
months. The boat was 30ft. long, Bft. Gin.
wide and 4ft. Gin. deep, and was built of
galvanised-steel plates. After being exhibited
in Australia, it was sent to Norway, where
it found a final resting-place in a Govern-
ment museum.
When Arthur Hogan, parish priest, passed
out in his sleep at Camden (N.S.W.) he
made the fifth Australian-born ex-professor
at the Cardinal’s College at Manly to die
young. The others were Bridge, Flemming,
Burke and O’Loughlin. Born in the Braid-
wood district, Hogan’s precocity caught the
eye of Dean Slattery, of Cooma, and, that
fine old scholar having taken him undef his
wing, the lad was a highly finished product
when he entered the Cardinal’s College in
1890. Later he was Diocesan Inspector of
Schools, with a place on the Discipline
Board.
Jack Barr, who will represent the Maori-
land House of Lords at the Empire Parlia-
mentary Conference, is a Scot who belongs to
the old school of Labor representatives. Born
in Paisley 59 years ago, and a Maorilander
for a quarter of a century, he still r-r-rolls
his r’s as if his foot was on his native heath.
His parents put him to the weaving at
Pollokshaws when he was but a wean, and
he stuck it three years before he organised
a strike. Then he emigrated to Canada and
turned his hand to many things. For years
he was secretary of the Hotel and Restau-
rant Employees’ Union in Christchurch, and
early discovered that honey catches more
flics than vinegar. The waiters retained
confidence in him. even when he became
mayor of a suburban borough and chairman
of the Christchurch Tramway Board. Joe
Ward, looking around in 1907 for a Leg.
Council nominee who would have a Labor
flavor and yet not frighten the respectable
old gentlemen who sat on the plush seats,
found Barr made to measure. Massey liked
Barr too, and he is now well into his third
seven-year term. He’s still strong for the
worker, but if he saw a Bolshevik he would
fly at him and bite him in the leg.
“Six-and-Eiglit” : Is this just queer coin-
cidence or is it something more? Laying
down The Bulletin’s article headed
“Twenty-two Dead Men,” calling for a fuller
inquiry into the foundering of the steamer
Dorrigo, I went on reading “South Sea
Reminiscences,” by T. R. St. Johnston: and
there I found a steamer Dorrigo. The author
describes her as a small cargo vessel which
used to cruise about the islands and on which
he once took passage from one part of a
group to another, and “thought we were go-
ing to roll right over more than once.” On
another occasion she was anchored in a deep,
narrow, oval-shaped bay at the north end of
Vanua Balavu Island :
A fearful hurricane arose. The ship’s head, of
course, swung round to it, and the captain had
three other great anchors put out and finally full
steam ahead, but even then the chains snapped one
by one and at last she was flung, racing blindly
like a mad thing, against the side of one of the
cliffs. The bridge snapped off and collapsed, the
captain was hurled down and the few men on board,
just stopping to pick him up, made one jump for
the rocks and scrambled into safety. Almost at once
the ship sheered off again, practically uninjured but
deserted, the engines still racing and without any
guiding hand at the wheel. In this condition she
was driven across the bay on to the only bit of
soft sand in the whole place. A few moments later
she ran on to a hidden reef, within a mile of the
scene of her late adventure, in so glassy a calm
that not a ripple stirred the surface to show where
the danger lurked. The Dorrigo was again got off,
practically without mishap, but I think she began
to be considered an unlucky ship. Anyhow she left
the local waters about that time and may have
changed her name.
This Dorrigo of the unenviable reputation in
the South Seas may not be the Dorrigo
which drowned the 22 sailors; if so it should
be worth the owners’ while to make the fact
known.

Explorers Use This Car Because
It Is Dependable
Pioneers and explorers, whose lives depend upon the
reliability of the transportation they use, employ Dodge
Brothers Motor Cars almost exclusively.
Stefansson used Dodge Brothers Cars through the uncharted
deserts of Central Australia. Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews,
on three different occasions, penetrated the innermost wastes
of Mongolia in a Dodge Brothers Car.
The car’s dependability is proverbial; and its exceptional
riding comfort permits long travel over bad roads without
fatigue.

Chilblains, Chapped Hands and Cold Sores all result
from exposure to the wind and weather, and cause
an unnecessary amount of suffering. Unnecessary,
because Rexona, the Rapid Healer, prevents just these
discomforts and keeps the hands in perfect condition
throughout the winter months.
There is no better treatment than to get a
tin of Rexona and apply this antiseptic
Rapid Healer on retiring.
First wash the hands with warm water and
Rexona Medicated Soap; dry carefully, and
then apply Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
Your hands will respond to
its healing influence and be
come soft and flexible, with-
out sores or blemishes.
Rexona is a specially pre-
pared product, made especially
to prevent and overcome all
winter skin troubles, and is
entirely different from all other
ointments and infinitely more
efficacious.
Rexona is composed of purest
vegetable juices and rare medi-
cal herbs, which make Rexona
an unequalled antiseptic, cool-
ing, soothing and healing oint-
ment. It is the greatest Skin
Remedy of the Age.
Join the throng, many thou-
sands strong, of people who
thank Rexona for skin health
and comfort during the winter
months. «
Miss Queenie Stanley, a
beautiful Rexona Girl, of
Waratah Flats, Bayswater
Road, Darlinghurst, N.S.W., who is
the possessor of this beautiful hand,
was awarded a Diamond Ring in “The
Most Beautiful Hands in Sydney” Competi-
tion. Miss Stanley writes us as follows:
“Having been the successful competitor in
the recent competition for ‘The Most Beautiful
Hands,’ I must appreciate the value of Rexona Soap
for keeping my hands attractive.”

The West Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SEEK ye the west wind, my brothers,
Ye that are hearth-forsakers?
Savage it roars adown the shores,
Combing the hair of the breakers.
Thrashing the tops of the timber,
Searching the forest, it hurries;
Little it shares our griefs and cares,
Little it recks of our worries.
Thrilling the heart of the rover,
Winning his feet to motion ;
Onward it roars' adown the shores,
Flecking the blue of the ocean.
Lord of the track and the highway,
Lord of the high, lone places,
Lord of the plain with loosened rein,
Ever and ever it races.
Seek ye the surge of the west wind,
Ye that are hearth-forsakers?
Savage and chill on dune and hill,
Combing the hair of the breakers !
n.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
White Night.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rn WO men and a woman were finishing
dinner in a large, old-fashioned room.
They fell silent as the maid carried
away the plates and dishes, cracking nuts
idly and littering the white cloth with the
shells. Each of the three was following the
train of thought that had lain behind the
casual conversation of the meal.
Ethel Sergeant rose, at last, to leave the
two men together. Her husband noticed that
as she passed his chair her fingers touched
lightly, for the merest instant, the sleeve
of Jim Ewett’s coat. When she had left the
room, “Come out on the lawn for a bit,
Jim,” he suggested. They rose.
The moonlight was white on the world out-
side, as though an impalpable fall of ghostly
snow had covered everything except the stark
shadows which stood out of the whiteness
like masses of sharply-defined Indian ink on
silver-paper. It had rained a little during
the day, and the heavy and sensual smell of
the earth came up out of the thick grass.
It was not a night to suggest sleep; rather
it teased the senses —sight, hearing, smell,
touch—to a keener pitch; it was a night
to carry to men and women a suggestion of'
a living, almost a moral, value; for the
trees, the grass, the flowers, affected subtly,
as they are in cities, by the living hand of
man, and betraying that deliberate interfer-
ence in their very shape, had a quality in
the clear night that suggested a hidden
spiritual intention rather than blind vege-
table growth. Such a night challenges the
spirit of man on its own plane instead of
furnishing it with malleable stuff for its
nourishment and assuagement.
Jim Ewett came out into it, a step or two
ahead of his host and friend. He could not but
feel the contrast between the harsh, sharp
clarity of the night, with its note of chal-
lenge, and the soft, almost dreamy comfort
of the room they had just left. It stirred
him a little unpleasantly. He was a big,
fair, loose, slouching man about thirty-five
years old. His eyes, grey and weary, were
heavily-lidded but keen and shrewd; his face
was clear and sensitively modelled. Perhaps
his most characteristic features were his
hands —strong, clever, agile, expressive hands.
The general impression received by those who
met him casually was of a cool-headed, rather
quiet but responsive man—responsive to their
moods, quick to grasp the meaning of what
he heard or the emotion they were trying
to convey. Many liked him ; no one disliked
him; he had few friends.
The closest of the few friends he had was
undoubtedly Dick Sergeant. Dick was not
unlike him in general appearance, but his
step was surer, and he held himself more
erect. He was rather more obtuse than Jim,
made of tougher metal. He thought more
slowly, and was more decisive in his pur-
poses, more intense in his attachments, more
serious and practical. His eyes were decep-
tively hard, and often seemed almost expres-
sionless.
“I don’t like these moonlight nights,” be-
gan Jim. “The light is”
“Listen, Jim,” Dick broke in; “I want
to say something. You probably know what
it is. I haven’t known for long what is
happening, and I don’t know how long it
has gone on.” He spoke quietly, almost con-
versationally. Jim realised that he had
known all along that this moment would
arrive, but he felt that he could never have
foreseen the tone that Dick would use. Now
it seemed inevitable that the matter should
be faced quite simply and calmly. He con-
tinued to stare into the white night. Dick
went on:
“If anyone is to be blamed, I suppose it
is you. But I don’t blame you. I love her
myself. I know she used to love me pretty
well. But you didn’t trust me very much,
old boy, did you? Why didn’t we have a
show-down when the thing first flared up?”
“Dick,” said his friend, “I’m sorry.”
They both knew that he meant he was
sorry that it had happened, that he had de-
ceived his friend, that somehow things had
worked out so rottenly.
“I won’t excuse myself. I can’t expect
you to have much to do with me after this.”
He hesitated. Dick was about to speak, but
Jim continued : “I don’t know—honestly, I
don’t —whether she loves me or not. I sup-
pose I love her It’s hard to be exact
about these things. Especially when they
come out blankly like this. But I suppose
I can only try to straighten things out a
bit. I’ll go inside and see Ethel, and tell her
that I shall not see her again. I hope I
haven’t smashed things finally and completely
for y0u.... I think you know what I feel.
....Neither of us wants to talk about it.”
“Won’t do, Jim,” Dick said quietly. “No,
I’m the outsider rather suddenly pushed
outside, if you like—and I can see more of
the game than you. I’m not going to do
any of the outraged-husband stuff. I know
you both too well. This is where I get off
the car.”
Ethel Sergeant came quietly across the
grass to join them. She was a small woman.
Her straight, upright carriage was the most
beautiful thing about her: it threw up her
head and gave her figure a lovely poise.
Both of the men—her husband and her lover
■ —thought just that as they watched her
come towards them through the false clarity
of the night.
Her face was intensely interesting to a
thoughtful observer. It was intelligent, but
a little too eager—eager for love, eager for
luxury, eager for ease and softness —and one
could see that the quickness and cleverness
of her youth (she was now about twenty-
five) had been warring with a distinct and
insidious tendency to surrender herself to
a kind of sloth. Her skin was just too* soft
■ —the very faintest hint too soft —her lips
•were almost too red, her hands a shade too
caressing. One thing alone, Jim thought,
saved her face, and might save the woman:
she had a wide, generous mouth, and the full
lips fulfilled the promise of the too-dark eyes
- —passion might draw the spirit within from
the drugged sleep that threatened to engulf
it, and throw the quick life into her face
again.
Jim felt a wave of shame rise with the tide
of his blood as he became conscious of the
thought. Ethel’s husband stood beside him,
the man (the human being, indeed) to whom
he had been nearest of all people in the
world, and lie had betrayed him. His mood
turned against the woman, as he saw her
approach, in spite of the response her
appearance had evoked in him. He reviled
her for a pretty, indolent, useless creature.
He hated her for having married his friend
and so laid that friend open to the wound
of treachery. He knew that she was
naturally inconstant —why had Dick not seen
it? Why had he built his life on such a
foundation? He had hardly felt that he was
wronging his friend. She was a loose woman,
and she had stirred nothing in him—or so he
told himself—beyond the crude itch for con-
quest that obsesses some men. And she had
undoubtedly fallen in love with him. He
wondered whether she had ever loved Dick
at all. Why had she married him?
Anyhow this was the end, as he must have
known somewhere inside himself from the
very beginning of the affair. Once again his
foolish vanity had betrayed him—the woman
had, all unconsciously perhaps to begin with,
tempted him and he had eaten. The pitiless
whiteness poured over her, as Ethel came up
to them. They were all three part of the
magical, hidden purpose of the night; it
shaped their minds and gave its pallid color
to their thoughts, so that they were, the
thoughts of all three, hard and crystalline
and clear as the moon.
Suddenly Dick moved and spoke to Jim
in a low voice.
“I don’t want to speak to her. I am going
now, this minute. Keep her here until I
pack a few things and get away.”
Jim’s hands moved towards his friend’s
arm, but Dick’s mind was made up. He
walked swiftly past his wife and into the
house, disappearing as Ethel reached Jim.
“Is anything the matter?” she asked.
“Dick knows all about it.”
She did not move; she showed no alarm.
“He w 7 as bound to know sooner or later,”
she said. “What’s going to happen?”
“Dick’s going away. Now. He’s leaving
us to it. I suppose he’ll write later and tell
you what he w'ants to do. No doubt he’ll
free you—allow you to divorce him or some-
thing. He’s not angry. But don’t go in-
side. Let him do as he wishes; whatever
happens he does not want to see you.”
He let himself sink upon a garden seat
and remained silent; Ethel stood beside him,
gazing quietly, almost broodingly, into the
white night. In a few minutes they heard
the car backing out of the garage at the
rear of the house; a door shut; there was
a series of short explosions, sharp and crack-
ling in the night air, and the car swung round
to the road before them and passed smoothly
and swiftly out of hearing.
The woman moved and put her hand on
his shoulder, but he did not stir. He was
thinking of what he had lost and of what
he had gained ; he weighed them one against
the other, and his mind saw the tilt of the
scales. He formed a childish image in his
mind of a balance; this woman whose hand
lay softly on his shoulder was poised against
her husband who had been his friend,, and
who was rushing away from them.
Ethel crossed suddenly before him and sat
beside him. For quite ten minutes neither
moved. Then she put an arm across his
shoulders, turned him gently, so that his eyes
were on hers, and spoke.
“Let us try to forget him, Jim. We have
each other, and we must all try to make the
most of our own lives. We cannot blame
ourselves if Dick has been hurt by the way.”
“Why did you marry him?” he asked
roughly.
“I married him before I met you, Jim.
Are you jealous? After what I’ve”
“Jealous!”
He was shaken by the word. He looked
curiously into her face, unnaturally white,
unnaturally brilliant in the intense light. He
thought, “At this moment I loathe you more
than any human being I have ever met.”
He raised his hands quietly to her neck, so
quietly that she did not suspect his purpose.
* * * *
He left her lying there and walked with-
out haste into the house. He found his coat,
hat and stick and passed out into the road.
He had not -walked more than fifty yards
when he saw 7 a man approaching, and recog-
nised him as the policeman, pacing his beat.
They greeted each other as they crossed, and
Jim passed on, walked home to his flat, and,
still quietly and gravely, sat in an armchair
aw T aiting a knock at his door. He w 7 as ready'
for it.
It came about am hour later, and he opened
the door to three men : two in plain clothes,
the third the policeman he had passed on
his way home.

SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY.
“iivery picture
Zells a St° r y
Mr. P. Smith, Clifton, 18 Hopetoun Street, Petersham, Sydnejj
savs: "1 used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills tor kidney trouble, ai
thev worked a miracle in my case. I had been under three doctou. at
different times, but their treatment did me no good. Ike ’h] , r u.
used to come on suddenly, and on many occasions 1 have had to knock
off work and be taken home. Several times 1 was so bad that 1 A\a.
driven to the hospital, and had to stay there for days. 1 could nevei
bend my back or move at all when I had a bad turn, and the secietio
were always disordered. The people at the hospital gave me medicines
and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was no use, they dm
not benefit me. 1 saw an advertisement tor Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills and procured this remedy. 1 only took a short couise and was
cured. After that I started work, and have kept at it ever since, an
it is heavy work iam doing, but it does not affect me. J?lvese T 1 11 s
cured me after years of suffering, and the relief was almost m. ta
taneous.” ,
Twenty years later Mr. Smith says: “I have still the same, good
opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills as when I made .the above
statement twenty years ago. If ever I teel the slightest. » •

have suffered know how awful it is. I
used dozens of Pile remedies, but could
not get anything to give me ease. _ A
friend urged me to try Doan’s Oint-
ment, saying he was sure this prepara-
tion would cure me. I got some and
commenced using it, and in a very short
time I was completely cured.”
Nine years later Mr. Abrahams says :
“I have not been troubled with Piles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over
nine years ago. I have advised many
sufferers to use this grand remedy, and
I am sure it will cure in every case if
people will only apply it properly.
AN UNDERCLIFFE CASE.
Mr F W Martin. Homer Street,
IJndercliffe, Sydney, says: "For about
12 months I was tortured with Itching
Piles and the pain and irritation nearly
drove me mad. I consulted a doctor,
and used Pile remedies, but could not
get permanent relief. I heard that.
Doan’s Ointment was good, and decided
to try it. After a few applications 1
felt better, and by the time the third
pot was finished I was perfectly cure .
I advise all those who suffer with Piles
to use Doan’s Ointment, as I am sur
they will benefit by it.
Eleven years later Mr Martin says:
“Eleven years ago I told y°u Doans
Ointment had cured me of Piles, i
onn now add that my cure has lasted,
for I am still free of this torturing-
ailment I always keep Doans Oint-
ment in the house, and use it occasion-
ally, just as a preventive against any
return.”

“Sorry to trouble you at this time of nxglit,
Mr. Ewett,” said the policeman. He intro-
duced to him Inspector Frank and Detective
Morton. Jim motioned them to come in, and
the three men entered. The Inspector spoke
first.
“Something horrible has happened, Mr.
Ewett,” he said. “I’d better' come to the
point at once.”
Jim watched him steadily. He thought:
“I could tell the man his next words.” but
lie was wrong. The Inspector went on:
“There was a motor smash at the culvert
down the road early this evening. The man
in the car was a friend of yours, so Jamieson
here says. Mr. Richard Sergeant. He was
killed.”
“Dick! Killed!”
“Sit down, Mr. Ewett. _ But that’s not all.
We found his address in his pocket-book,
and when we got back to the house we found
—l’m afraid I must prepare you for a
greater shock —we found that he had killed
his wife—strangled iter on the front lawn,
and apparently rushed off in the car imme-
diately afterwards, and —but you can see it
all.”
Jim continued to stare into the Inspector’s
eyes. The latter continued quietly :
“Perhaps I’d better drop around and see
you in • the morning instead. It must be
awful for you. We wouldn’t have troubled
you to-niglit if Jamieson here hadn’t seen
you strolling home with Mr. Sergeant.”
Jim’s eyes jerked to those of the police-
man.
“And as you were the last person to see
either of them,” broke in the Inspector, “of
course I had to come to hear what you could
tell us. But I’ll come back in the morning.
Will that do you? Merc formalities, you
know. Any information that will throw
light on the tragedy. I can understand” —■
the three men made for the door —“I can
understand how you feel. I won’t bother
you any more to-night. About ten?”
He held out his hand. Jim took it.
“About ten,” he said.
The three men left, and he shut the door.
When he was alone he found himself shud-
dering, but his mind was perfectly clear.
He forced himself to realise the incredible
truth: that Dick must have been killed soon
after he had left his house, and that death
had meant to him a greater understanding
than life could ever have given him. He
must have realised, from that mysterious
region into which he had been so suddenly
hurled, that his friend’s safety was of more
moment than the fate of the light woman he
had killed. He must have determined to
save him. He had done so.
Jim Ewett began to cry like a girl.
WARREN GRAVES.
Two Deals in Livestock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN..]
A LTIIOUGH Louis Goldberg’s business
motto was “Safety first” he could
be tempted, after a satisfactory
half-year’s balancing, to take an unusual
risk. Loans on pianos, household furniture,
shopfittings and interests under wills were
his stock lines, but on two occasions the
high rate of interest offered led to little
flutters in livestock —one an advance of six
donkeys with a camel thrown in, and the other
a bill of sale on a racing pony, with a half
share in a prize for which he was a trier.
The donkeys and camel were owned by an
entrepreneur of renown who catered for
the amusement of the patrons of Sandring-
ham beach —a voluble optimist who believed
in the power of the cumulative penny. He
had it all worked out on paper. Six don-
keys, over a marked course on the beach —
an average of twenty-five trips per hour for
each donkey for eight hours each Saturday,
Sunday and holiday twelve hundred rides;
adults 2d., children Id. per ride, average
lid.; gross takings per day, £7 10s. The
camel, over a longer course, (id. per ride;
eighty rides a day—another £2. It certainly
looked a safe proposition for an advance of
£5O for six months with £4O interest, inclu-
ding an extra £2O added for the “unusual”
risk. So the stock mortgage, with a separ-
ate bill of sale over the saddles, was duly
registered.
But the calculations of gross receipts
proved to be as visionary as the prospectus
of a wild-cat mining company. The owner
of the animals, after paying the first instal-
ment and half the second, fell hopelessly
into arrears. The Saturday takings were all
right, but from religious and other scruples
the patrons of the beach seemed to regard
the menagerie—especially the camel —as a
nuisance. And that camel! It was too
old. It could get on to its knees all right,
but as soon as the passengers were aboard
seemed unable to rise until half the cargo
had been jettisoned. Twice it had fallen
and hurt people, and once it had broken
from its keeper and taken a terrified mother
and two children for a long cruise across
the neighboring sandhills. And its food cost
more than its gross earnings.
“Why for you buy a gamel dat can’t on
its feet stand?” demanded Louis.
And then the owner admitted it was a
cast-off from a travelling -circus. So the
camel was shot and sold to a tallow works,
the proceeds, 255., being duly credited as a
payment off the advance.
For the next six months the donkeys
gave Louis Goldberg’s Atlas Company
more trouble than all the rest of its securi-
ties put together. Louis began to doubt
the good faith of his debtor and found it
necessary, at a cost of 2s. 6d. for fares, to
inspect and count the donkeys once a week.
And they seemed to know that this visitor
had tainted them with a Twice
he was kicked and once bitten, while trying
to determine by personal examination if they
were being properly fed. A forced sale
was out of the question, as the demand for
such commodities was very limited.
Some £l5 had been paid off the
mortgage when real disaster came. The
Shire Council passed an ordinance prohibit-
ing the presence of camels, donkeys and
other quadrupeds, excepting dogs, on the
beach without special permit. The owner
defied the Council and was promptly fined
£2, with a guinea costs, which sum Louis
was forced to pay in avoidance of a sheriff's
sale. But again a string of donkeys
appeared on * the beach, and another
fine, again paid by the harassed mortgagee,
was inflicted for driving animals across the
reserve.
Then Louis followed the unusual course of
taking legal advice and adding another
10s. 6d. to a hopeless debt.
As soon as the owner of. the donkeys heard
that his stock was to be seized, he became
truculent. The inner office rang with high-
pitched altercation.
"I lose £7O on the donkeys, and you mort-
gage to me a phony garnel!” wailed Louis,
“and you starve them. They may be dead
now to-morrow”....
“All right,” was the reply; “come and
take your dirty donkeys. Keep them in your
front parlor or in your safe, or eat them.”
Next morning at seven o’clock Louis re-
ceived a telephone message : “Come down .to
the office. Something serious has happened.”
“No fire can’t hurt me,” he replied. “My
safe was fire-proof and the office furniture
was insured.”
“Somebody’s broken into your safe!” was
the answer.
“My Gott!” shrieked Louis, and covering
his pyjamas with an overcoat he broke all
records in reaching the Lane. And there he
found, securely roped to the front door of
No. 26, a string of moth-eaten, dejected don-
keys. with an astonished policeman acting
as chaperon.
Louis always knew when the end had
come. Effusively shaking hands with the
officer lie said: "I give you a pound to take
dem away—anyhow—anywheres !”
* * * *
But there is a law of compensation even
in Portland-lane. The pony mortgage
panned out at 4oz. to the ton —although on
paper it was not nearly as promising as the
venture on donkeys.
Louis had a wholesome distrust of Jews.
“They never tell you all aboud it,” he ex-
plained to me once. “Alvays someding up
deir sleeves, and dey alvays calculate so
quick. I say to a voman that £2 on £5
for dree months is only 40 per cent. She
says yes, and sign up quick. But if I say
it to one of dem, he say one hundred and
twenty per cent, per annum, widout allow-
ing for the interest you get from re-invest-
ing the instalments.”
But David Reubens made no pretences.
“It’s a straight gamble,” he said. “I can
get a half share in the pony for £4O, and
it’s a real horse. The owner don’t know her
worth. I've tried her out. long distance,
short distance, and there’s a race at Ascot
in five weeks which she can win, if I
ride her.”
Goldberg’s knowledge of the turf was
limited, but he shared the popular concep-
tion of the temptations to which jockeys
and trainers are subjected.
“But perhaps they square you to lose?”
he hinted.
“Me! With a half-share in the horse and
a starting price of ten to one?”
“But the half share will be in my name.
You might forget my mortgage, eli?”
“Now, do I look that sort?”
Louis gazed at him critically and decided
that he did not. For a racecourse tout he
had a remarkably frank face, and he was
so confident of the result. It would give
him a start. There would be six hundred
to divide if it came off, and he had twice
seen the horse winning in a dream. That
settled it. Louis believed in dreams, and
the bargain was concluded —a gamble of
£."><) to £3OO, without counting any quint
bets of bis own.
The next five weeks were the most fever-
ish of Goldberg’s existence. Without dis-
closing the name of the horse he told me
all about the speculation and invited me to
spend a Saturday afternoon with him at
Ascot—his first visit to a racecourse. He
wanted to get the “atmosphere” before the
great day.
“I did not like it.” lie told me next day.
“All dose peoples drying to get each odder's
money for nodding, and the vay the horse
you dink is best the last runs. I had live
shillings on Old Gold, five to van, but
anybody could see that jockey vas not dry-
ing.”
I could not resist the temptation to visit
Ascot on the great day. Louis avoided me.
He avoided everybody. The other races
passed unnoticed as he stood about a hun-
dred yards from the stables, furtively watch-
ing the horses. Never for a moment did
he allow his interest in any particular horse
to be detected. I dogged him to the betting
paddock, and at last heard him mutter
“Acorn,” and hand out a pound. I promptly
wandered to the other end of the paddock
and speculated £10 —all the money I had
been able to raise—at ten to one.
The race was just starting when I again
saw Louis. I knew I was about to witness
a unique study in emotions, and secured a
place at an angle which gave a full view
of his face. In spite of my own interest
in the event I never once glanced at the
field. He stood on a seat, pale and taut,
his eyes glittering as with high fever.
“They’re off!” someone shouted, and he wiped
the sweat from his forehead. Then, as if
chanting in the Synagogue, he emitted a
guttural “Agorn ! Agorn ! Agorn !” At no
moment had he any idea of the position
of the horses, and until the numbers went
up I heard that “Agorn ! Agorn! Agorn !”
When it was over he said to a discon-
solate punter: “Who von?”
“Acorn. Blast him!” was the reply.
And Louis staggered to the betting ring
and collected his £ll.
David Reubens played fair. The £3OO
duly passed into Goldberg’s coffers, and
beyond an occasional regret at not having
ventured a little more in the ring he was a
happy man for several weeks.
He confided in me later on that his only
reason for abandoning all his resolves never
to gamble—‘which to him meant never to
lend money without seizable security—was
to square off the donkey loss.
“But never no more,” he said. “Horse-
racing is the deffil. You know, my heart
stood still first, and then raced just like
Acorn. It make mo sick for two flays.”
