The Red Page
War
Besieged in Kut and After, by Major
Charles 11. Barber ( Blackwood, 55.); is
highly interesting narrative of an adven
ttsre about which the world has heard very
few details. The author, who was in. the
medical service, chats discursively of the
incidents of the siege. All through his lios
pital was shelled, and casualties both to
patients and staff were frequent. So' close
was the enemy that there was no site be
yond tiie reach of his guns. This doctoi
has a hitter prejudice against shells: “They
are indelicate and beastly in their blind
blundering range. To the surgeon, suet
indiscriminate violence is intensely abhor-
rent; the clumsy damage to the beautiful,
perfectly-planned human organism makes his
professional spirit wince....and he wonders
at all the farcical talk and controversy over
explosives and dum-dum bullets whilst the
effects of shell-fire are tolerated without a
murmur.” As the siege progressed there
grew in the cemetery a rapidly spreading
forest of small wooden crosses, and the
padres were never at rest. The trenches
were in places within 20 yards of each other.
At first the garrison was buoyed up
with the hope of early release; later on they
heard the guns of the relieving force, but
that was all. The tobacco problem became
acute; lime leaves were a poor substitute.
Rations were successively reduced, but the
garrison kept up heart. The attempt to
feed that crowded village by aeroplane, as
the ravens did Elijah—a brilliant idea, but
begun two weeks too late —is humorously
described. Evidently the pilots were bad
shots; sometimes they dropped their sacks
of flour into the river or into the Turkish
lines; and then a wireless message would
go: “Would H.M. Navy mind dropping us
something now and then instead of to the
Turks?” or: “Was the R.F. quite sure it
was on the right river?”
So with indomitable cheerfulness and
stolid British humor the author takes us to
the surrender, lie was ultimately exchanged,
but he had first to go in charge of wounded
to Baghdad. The Turks treated their British
prisoners of rank courteously, though the
wounded and sick privates were regarded
with a callousness that is no doubt natural
to the Turk. One German, whom the author
believed to be exaggerating, said: “I’m sorry
to see your fellows going away into captivity.
I don’t suppose 10 per cent, of them will
ever see their homes again.” The captured
British army was marched through the
crowded streets of Baghdad in triumph ; but
the multitude remained silent. The author
found many evidences of the svmpathy of
the citizens. A brief history of Baghdad up
to its final capture by the British forms one
of the most interesting chapters of an ex-
tremely readable book.
The death on active service of Donald
Ilankey, author of A Student in Arms, is
another serious loss to literature. However,
from his papers enough has been gathered
to make a second series under the same title
(Melrose, per Dymock’s Library). Hankey
was meant to be a soldier: he got, his com-
mission in the Royal Garrison Artillery and
served in Mauritius; buLreligious considera-
tions intervening he resigned his commission
in order to study theology. He went to
Oxford, came down to run a boys’ club in
the London slums, roughed it in Australia.
The outbreak of the war found him in Eng-
land, and he enlisted and received his com-
mission in his old regiment. But he was
not too fond of the guns: he exchanged into
an infantry regiment, as a private.
This second series of A Student in Arms
was written in the trenches —the first was
written in England; and the author, in a
private letter, admits a change of tone. This
graver note is to be found in his article upon
the bad side of military service. The ordi-
nary soldier “loathes the war, and the grand-
iloquent speeches of politicians irritate him
by their failure to realise how loathsome
war is. At the same time he knows he has
got to go through with it, and only longs
for the chance to hurry up.”
The charge that military service has a
brutalising effect on the soldier is fully and
frankly met. “Wherever there are troops,
and especially in wartime, there are ‘bad’
women and weak women. The result is
inevitable. A certain number of both officers
and men ‘go wrong.’ ” When the author
was a private in camp in England he states
that most of the privates spent a great
deal of their leisure, owing to the lack of
rational amusement—as then the Army
recreation tents, etc., were too small—“on
the streets,” poor and impecunious; “and
if a fellow ran up against ‘a bit of skirt,’
he was generally just in the mood to follow
it wherever it might lead. The moral of this
is, double your subscription to the Y.M.C.A.,
church huts, soldiers' clubs or whatever
organisation you fancy! You will be help-
ing to combat vice in the only sensible way.
I don't suppose that the officers were much
better off than we were.... They had more
money to spend, and perhaps more to occupy
their minds. But I fancy that as great a
proportion of them as of us took the false
step.” This is of the army at home.
J*
On active service every feature is a hun-
dred times intensified. liaukey contrasts the
state of the men in the trendies, a state of
disgusting uncleanliness,’ of nervous, tension,
of sleepless nights filled with anxieties and
responsibilities, with danger and death
always waiting. Then after a week or a
month of this they return to billets. “Ten-
sion is relaxed. There is an inevitable re-
action. Officers and men alike determine to
‘gather rosebuds’ while they may. Their
bodies are fit, their wills are relaxed. If
they are built that way. and an opportunity
offers, they will ‘satisfy the’ lusts of the
flesh.’ ”
After real fighting the dangers of the reac-
tion are intensified. We who stay at home
and doubtless deplore the morality of the
bloke who is fighting for us, do not realise
What* his first bayonet-thrust means to a
soldier. He has to overcome his first re-
pugnance ; after that he sees red; he lets
loose his long-controlled, primitive blood-
lust. “And that letting loose of a primitive
lust is not going to be without its effect on
a man’s character. At the same time, of
course, not all of us become animals out
here. There are other influences at work.
... .The letters of my platoon are largely
love letters—often the love-letters of mar-
ried men to their wives.” There is immo-
rality in the army; if there is more abroad
it is because there is far greater temptation.
Hankey asks the padres, especially those
who are saints, to realise that in civil life
as in army life the average man is immoral,
both in thought and in deed. Hankey men-
tions four powers which are stronger than
“the flesh”—-the zest of a quest, religion,
hero-worship, and the love of a good woman.
“If a man is not possessed by one of these
he will be immoral.” Surely Hankey is too
sweeping; he omits at least three other
rowers that are stronger than the bodily
appetites—the power of convention, the fear
of consequences and mental control—with-
out considering the class of men whose pas-
sionate desjres are weak.
The Student in Arms concludes: “Per-
haps most men are immoral if they get the
chance. Most soldiers are immoral if they get
the chance. And those who are trying to help
the soldiers can do so with a good heart if
they realise that in him they have a founda-
tion on which to build. Alreadv he is half
a hero-worshipper. Already he half believes
in the beauty of sacrifice and the life im-
mortal. Already he is predisposed to value
exceedingly all that savors of clean, whole-
some home-life. On that foundation it
should be possible to build a strong ideal-
ism which shall prevail against the flesh.”
There is. however, the medical side to con-
sider : the doctors could perhaps tell us
whether in this period of relaxation after
intense strain “the lusts of the flesh” play
a beneficent or a dangerous part.
J*
He also acutely discusses the good side
of militarism. The war correspondent sees
only the outside of the individual soul. He
sees the steadiness of eye and mouth of the
men as they march to the front, hears the
cheery jest. He sees those that return
weary, yet still with a quip for the passer-
by. “He gives us a picture of men without
nerves.. . .The ‘Tommy’ of the war-corres-
pondent is not a human being, but a lay
figure with a gift for repartee. We soldiers
know better. know that each of these
men is an individual with a healthy in-
dividual’s repugnance to being maimed
The knowledge of all this does not do away
with the even tread of the troops as they
pass, the steady eye and mouth, the cheery
jest, but it makes these a hundred times
more significant.”
Analysing the fear of deatE in war, this
acute observer finds there is practically no
tear. At the moment of a charge men are in
an absolutely abnormal condition : “There is
a _ sensation of tense excitement combined
with a sort of uncanny calm. Noises, sights
and sensations which would ordinarily pro-
duce intense feeling, horror or dread have no
effect on them at all, and yet never was their
mmd clearer, their sight, hearing, etc., more
acute. „ .But with the issue before them,
ith victory or death or the prospect of
eternity, their minds blankly refuse to come
to grips Very few men are afraid of
death m the abstract. Very few men believe
in Hell, or are tortured by their consciences.
I hey are doubtful about after death, hesitat-
mg between a belief in eternal oblivion and
a belief in a new life under the same manage-
ment as the present; and neither prospect
hlls them with terror. If only one’s ‘people’
would be sensible, one would not mind.”
There is, however, a purely physical re-
action and shrinking from the pain of death
and wounds; but such a reaction can be, and
usually is, controlled by the mind. Hankey
testifies that the cases where any sort of
fear, even for a moment, obtains the mastery
of a man are very rare. And these cases
are confined to young boys, very egotistical
or very introspective men. or men of obvi-
ously low intelligence.

Guy Thornton, a Baptist padre with the
M.L. forces, tells of his experiences With
the Anzacs in Cairo (Allenson, per Sydney
Book Club). “Persistent rumors, more or
less exaggerated, have been circulated wfith
regard to the behavior of our brave Aus-
tralian, M.L. and British troops whilst they
were stationed in or near Cairo.” This padre
concludes that taking into consideration the
abnormal temptations of Cairo the wonder
is not that so many fell, but that so many
didn’t. As plainly as a Baptist padre can,
lie describes the cesspool of vice that was
left open to trap our clean-living and inex-
perienced Billjims. And he spent most of
liis time “slumming” in that abode of white,
brown and mottled Flossie. Of licensed
native women there were 21100, and over 800
licensed European women; while “un-
licensed women were everywhere”; and
liquor was plentiful, cheap and frequently
doped.
“Cooped up in transports for eight weeks,
under what is to them severe discipline, is it
to be wondered at that the reaction was
great; that a certain proportion, loosed for
the first time from the restraints of home
and of a Christian land, should plunge into
excess; that, withheld from intoxicants for
weeks, they should, in a city where nearly
every shop sold liquor, drink to excess?”
Yet Padre Thornton puts down the propor-
tion as lower than 5 per cent. And nine-
tenths of the men who went wrong did so
under the influence of strong—or doped—
drink.
The padre’s self-appointed job was to fre-
quent the worst streets and warn Billjim
away from the houses. Sometimes be was
attacked by the natives, but he knew how to
use his fists —and his boot. And he found
that Billjim, unless very drunk, always took
his warnings in good part. lie must have
saved hundreds of young Billjims from dis-
astrous consequences; but the pity is that
the temptation was so easy of access to the
camps. And this worthy wowser was even
more astonished when he reached London to
find street-vice there so rampant. Reading
his faithful, if slightly unctuous, account of
his efforts, interspersed with various anec-
dotes of the conversion of Billjims, one feels
that our boys had not a fair deal. Of the
trouble in Cairo that C. E. W. Bean cabled
about, this padre mentions not a word. A
book for The Ernest Wowser.

THE BASE HOSPITAL.
The long white ward with quilted beds arow,
Each tidy locker gay with nodding flowers ,
The white-capped sisters, hastening to and
fro
Through all the silent hours.
The weary, white-gowned surgeons, skilfully
With probe and forceps search each gap-
ing wound;
And through the morning’s cold air, drearily,
The stifled groanings sound.
Upon the bed he lies, and counts the ropes
And poles above his head: the weak sun-
beams
That play about the beds; then, dozing,
gropes
His way through weary dreams.
He listens to the imnderings of his mates’
Delirium; the frogs; the million
Strange sounds that make the day; and
waits, and waits
The setting of the sun.
For whatf He knows not. Still the day is
past;
Then, through the tent, he counts the
stars, until
A stab within the arm—and then, at last
His weary brain is still.

By Peter Austin, in “Bill-Jim.”
Peter Austin, author of Bill-Jim (Gordon
and Gotcli, Brisbane), does not pretend to
be a poet; he is a Billjim, returned after
three years service, who remembers. These
verses are the real thing, too true to need
literary graces. Such themes would have
been worthy of a great poet; but Peter
Austin’s sincerity is sufficient for his modest
claim to be the mere interpreter of his mates
He does not pretend to be a Leon Gellert'
he is The Sentimental Bloke with the senti-
ment mislaid. Despite Dennis, this page
doubts if it ever was there. Incidentally
this dialect, peppered with apostrophes, is
annoying both to the typist and the lino-
man, and the attempt of writers of dialeet or
slang to conform to literary usage, by indi-
cating by apostrophes the"missing letters, is
both futile and false. It purposes to be the
actual reproduction of the sound of the
spoken word; but it also pretends to be the
writing not of the author but of the charac-
ter to whom the author has given speech. Iu
this case the speaker is supposed to be Bill-
jim, not Peter Austin, who knows how to
spdl and to speak correctly. But Billjim,
writing the line (if he pronounced it that
way) :
Th’ ’ orrer , th’ stink, an ’ til’ shime nr war
would not write it like that. He would not
know that he was leaving letters out; how
then could he indicate each omission by an
apostrophe? Really, he would write it like
this:
I'll orrer, th stink, an th shime uv war.
Now, that is more easily read, more easily
written, and gives the actual sound of the
words more clearly than the grammarian’s
punctilious rule that for every letter
omitted in the spoken word an apostrophe
should appear in the written word to remind
the reader of the omission. The reader does
not leant to be reminded of the correct form
of the written word : it is an unwarrantable
intrusion of the pedagogue between the
reader and the page. Consider how much
more attractive The Sentimental Bloke would
appear without the peppering of every page
with impertinent apostrophes! And how
much more readable. Try the experiment.
The Commonwealth of Australia: Its
Development and Resources, by Evans
Lewin (Allen and Unwin, Is.), is the third
volume of the British Empire Section in the
International Information Series. The
author, who is Librarian of the Royal
Colonial Institute, furnishes an unbiased
and lucid account of us. He advocates an
extension of the railway from Oodnadatta to
the Macdonnell Ranges, not only as a neces-
sary step in the settlement of the Territory,
but as the main consideration of the develop-
ment of the huge latent and pastoral wealth
of the interior. As for rainfall, he makes
the two points that already we possess an
area the size of Austria-Hungary, France,
Germany and Spain, with an annual fall of
over 20 inches, and that the “deserts” are
continually shrinking at the approach of
scientific methods of water conservation.
“There remain vast territories within the
Commonwealth, kingdoms in point of size,
of which the possibilities are as yet but
dimly perceived.” We are a little surprised
to learn, though, that: “It should be clearly
understood that the Australian people are pur-
suing a national industrial ideal. They have
escaped from the thraldom of the pastoral
and agricultural idea.” The author, noting
our tendency toward the formation of
“spheres of influence” and the extension of
territorial sovereignty, considers that within
the near future Australia and Maoriland
will be responsible for the administration
and defence of all the British possessions in
the South Pacific.

Bon Ami does the work so fast
and so easily that it is fun to
clean windows with it.
Just cover the glass with the
white foam and let it dry. Then
a dry cloth removes the dry foam
very easily, taking awav all the
dirt at the same
time. When the
window is cleaned
with Bon Ami it is
so clear that you
cannot see the glass.
In the United States
almost everybody cleans their

Bon Ami is also for mirrors,

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared, for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Cherry-Time.
In an orchard far away,
Youth and I together
Watched the seasons day by day
Painting flower and feather ;
Watched the cherry blossom glow,
Heard the thrush elated —
Oh, but it was long ago
Since we two were mated !
Came the Summer hot on Spring,
Blooding all the berries,
And the parrots, banqueting,
Plashed among the cherries.
After winter’s frost and rime,
After heavens leaden,
A merry time is cherry-time
When the cherries redden.
Sun-caressed, and zephyr-fanned,
Roses drooped and slumbered;
Half the land was orchard-land,
Half was flower-encumbered.
Now a moth his calling plied,
Now a brown bee settled
On the roses, damask-dyed,
Tall and velvet petalled.
After winter’s frost and rime,
After heavens leaden,
A cosy time is posy time,
When the roses redden.
Lighting all the scented scene,
Through the orchard-garden,
Soft of foot and gay of mien,
Walked the roses’ warden.
Roses, roses dead and gone!
Cherry-branches fruity!
Where is she who shed upon
Fruit and petal beauty?
Ah. though sweet be earth at Spring,
Donning green o’ grasses,
A magic thing, a tragic thing,
Is love that laughs and passes.

Of Books.
This was myself that I had lost!
And this myself that I had found !
Eager the eye ran o’er each page
As, nose to earth, a hunting hound.
This way and that the mind played wide,
With here a pause for something new.
Strange that I never knew myself
Till I had found her here in you !
You, as it were, upon my shelf!
In you am I ! Ah. wonderingly
I have been asking all day long
If you have found yourself in me.

The Kiss.
Just yesternoon, ’mid sunlight hidden,
Reckless of every coming morrow,
A dear fay kissed me all unbidden,
And drove away my sorrow.
Sweet lips had she, demurely parted,
Quite adequately for true kissing.
I heard no more (I, broken-hearted)
The Serpent’s ominous hissing.
She kissed me once, but now for ever
I’ll feel her pouted lips’ surrender.
Sure the grim Fates before have never
So blessed an old offender!
And now that creeping shadows lengthen,
Whatever hoped-for joy may miss me,
Still shall I cry, my dreams to strengthen,
“Fay of my heart, come kiss me !’’

Week End.
Some shadows round the trees I saw, and
in the dawn.
And round the edges of the dark. _
The furtive, purring spirit voice of each
brown faun
Was in mine ears ; and I did hark
To all the trembling twilit fields’ long call.
My heart held speech with myriad reddened
leaves that fall
Into the lap of coming Spring;
And long I listened rapt to Summer burgeon-
ing.
Beside the shadowy stream-side nymphs I
knelt
And hearkened faithfully their words.
And under mossy river-banks warm hands I
felt,
Like small field-mice or frightened birds.
Deep in a cloud of hurrying brown leaves I
fled
Down to a battlemented sunset red and red;
Past woodland companies of elves
And woodland dreams that sorrowing dream
themselves.
Three days I walked there silent, hand in
hand with Pan.
Three days—and all my earthly days.
Long-hoarded magic of the woods was mine ;
I ran
From hedge to hedge by Pan’s own ways;
And under each curled leaf I found my talis-
man,
Close-furled and wrapt in mist which no
man’s eyes might scan
Save mine, who swept past harebells. tall.
Fast following with Pan his deep, insistent
call.
And in the fourth day’s dawn I saw and felt
the rain.
And sadly hied me back to town to work
again.

AUTOCRACY’S BADGE OF
DISHONOR.
Even if it were true, as lately alleged by
Willie Watt in Sydney, that some immu-
table law is in operation “making it almost
impossible for a democracy to fight as the
autocracies of the world fight,” the circum-
stance would seem to be only a further
guarantee that Providence had doomed all
autocrats and potentates to destruction. The
rising tide of democracy cannot be dammed
back by the delivery of speeches from thrones
that monarchy and privileged classes are the
best international butchers. There are mul-
titudinous reasons for this, but two of them
alone are sufficient to eventually put the
autocrat’s pot on. The first is that the pro-
letariat yearns more for peace than for war.
The second is that the heap of festering
bones called military glory is no substitute
for the right of the people to say whether
they want any more such heaps. The
greater eminence of autocracy in bash, if it
exists, is not, then, a good reason why
democratically-inclined people should begin
to get nervous about their theories and start
admiring crowned heads. Crowned heads
have been carrying on war with varying
results for thousands of years, and modern
democracy is really a reflection of the com-
paratively new idea that the time is ripe
to curb their habit of butting in on the
slightest provocation or without any at all
and disturbing the peace. There were times
when the person inhabiting the local castle
made a hobby of rushing off with his retainers
to tilt at somebody else in the same line of
business, lie often did the job like a trades-
man ; but the finish of him was that he got
his collective nose put out of joint, mainly
because of the growth of a popular prejudice
against being slain and pillaged. When a
monopoly of authority passed into the hands
of king or emperor, the next business the
people found they had on hand was to deal
with him and restrain his hourly impulse
to provide them with another battle. Some-
times the proletariat got tired of the poten-
tate and chopped his head off. Occasionally
they exchanged him for someone else—and
generally made matters worse. At other
times they merely hunted him off the pre-
mises and spent the rest of their lives leap-
ing about the frontier chasing him away
again. But all the time the movement was
towards emancipation from the tyranny of
autocracy by widening tbe basis of citizen-
ship, responsibility and control. Now the
world has reached the stage when as a
generalisation it can be said that even where
monarchy exists it only survives by the sanc-
tion of democracy, and where autocracy sits
enthroned it is fighting for life against moral
forces compared with which its armies and
its victories are futile.
But is it true that autocracy is more
efficient in war than democracy merely be-
cause it is autocracy? The autocracy of
the Czars was absolute. He who may per-
haps be the last of his wretched line saw
his armies march into the field to be
slaughtered like sheep. It was because
autocracy in Russia, always a failure in
peace, had once more in this war proved
itself a nerveless imposture, that the revolu-
tion was launched. Germany is not quite an
autocracy, though it is very near being one.
France is a democracy, or a very close
approach to one. In Austria mediaeval ideas
about kings and queens survive in more
full-blooded form than anywhere else in
Europe. Yet whatever may be the verdict
of the historian on the evolution of govern-
ment, there is certainly no evidence so far
to justify anyone in believing that the
democracy of France has borne itself with
less resolution or has shown less efficiency
in its direction of the fight than the
autocracies east of the Rhine. And then
take Britain—a democracy of advanced type,
in comparison with her enemies, at any rate.
Admit all the muddling. Concede all the
preliminary and incidental errors of judg-
ment and execution. Would it be a fair
thing to say that she has shown any less
efficiency than autocratic Germany, less
resiliency than any or all of the Central
Powers? This paper does not think so. Nor
does it believe that had one of those
autocracies entered the war with the equip-
ment possessed by Britain it would have
accomplished one-fourth of what the Old
Cold Country has achieved. It is a sheer
delusion, then, to imagine that any historical
justification exists for looking upon democ-
racy as incompetent in war or upon
autocracy as being universally efficient.
Kings and queens have scores of times
despatched armies to overwhelming defeat,
have witnessed their countries being ravaged
and their people reduced to bondage. In
the hour of defeat an autocracy is the most
impotent form of government the -world
knows anything about. When it perishes
there is usually nothing but anarchy to take
its place. Let any doubter compare the
history of North America with that of
Russia. The United States carried on a
sanguinary civil war, and at the end the
nation’s institutions were unimpaired, and
democracy was more firmly established than
before. To-day that country is entering into
what may be an even greater trial, but with
a firmer faith and clearer hope in the
triumph of her arms than Germany has in
the victory of Csesarism. What is true is
that in scheming to provoke wars, in getting
ready for unprovoked assaults upon the life
and property of adjoining peoples, in delud-
ing men about the aim and purpose of
military establishments and in manipulating
the strings of secret diplomacy, autocracy
has an advantage over democracy. It has
this because it is an organised lie; because
it is unclean from top to bottom; because
its claims to admiration on account of its
exploits in war amount to a blasphemous
exaltation of murder.
* * * *
The excuse made for inefficiency and muddle
—for this is what the talk about the difficul-
ties of carrying on war in a democracy
amount to—is own brother to the other one
concerning the “difficulties of government”
in a democracy at peace. Yet who is there
believes the difficulties of government iu
Germany are less than they are in Britain
or France—thgt Austria is more easily gov-
erned than the United States of America?
If there is any such person he has a queer
conception of what goes on in those coun-
tries and a still more quaint notion of the
course of political evolution in Europe. The
loud, threatening yell that arises every few
weeks among democrats and drives quaking
politicians into their lairs is not one-
hundredth part so ominous as the dead
silence surrounding an autocracy, broken
sometimes by the sound of an exploding
bomb. So The Bulletin counsels Willie
Watt to cheer up and lose not his faith in
the crowd. His bowels may stir in pain
when he thinks of the Bolsheviks: but if he
asks himself what Ivan was getting out of
the last autocracy he may come to the con-
clusion that, after all. it were better to
have started life in Victoria than in Petro-
grad. It may cause him a severe headache
when he hears a frantic howl from the
scarcely-awakened, party-ridden democracy
of Australia and sees the paltry and ignoble
put above eternal truth. But the patriot
will exaggerate neither the weaknesses nor
the virtues of democracy. His main job will
be to help it discipline itself, to trust itself,
to believe in its universal mission and jus-
tice. And the more he concentrates on
disciplining himself and scotching the joss
of party that is a more sinister enemy of
democracy than all the autocracies on earth,
and the less he admires a despotism but-
tressed by chicanery and lust for war. the
more is he likely to succeed. It is no good
democracy looking backwards. When it
begins to do that the Devil thoughtfully pro-
vides futher accommodation.

“War is a blasphemous denial of every Christian
creed; yet the Allied armies are fighting for every
ideal for which Christianity ever stood.”
There rose a sobbing on the winds of
Heaven.
Knife-keen, the murder-shrieks between the
stars
Startled the tall archangels, seven on seven.
Flame-robed in ranks to guard the erystai
bars.
Fear grappled at the inmost heart of calm.
The curtains of the Holiest shook and
swayed
To gusty discords. Ceased the age-long
psalm.
The rainbows round the throne began to
fade.
All heads were bent as at a tempest’s breath.
Prayer trembled terror from white hands
upraised.

Spikenard of adulation round His feet, .

By alchemy of dreams grown holy-sweet.
But now He stirred. Ilis human heart,
awake.
Throbbed with God-yearnings for Ilis world
below.
A storm of tears all Heaven seemed to shake
Where Mary’s Son wept for His brothers’
woe.
A darkness fell upon ten thousand thrones.
All angels veiled their eyes. All mouths
were dumb
Till God’s eternal voice in awful tones
Of deeper silence spoke: “The hour is
come!”
The light rolled back. The Christ was seen
to smile.
O'er all blue ways a holy gladness ran.
And dow T n through lanes of harpings mile on
mile
The Saviour went, praise-girt, with aid for
man.
Peace was His guide, as incense round Him
curled,
To those red fields where hate made sport
with pain ;
Yet in her agonies the dying world
Knew not the truth that Christ had come
again.
Long bellowings of thunder shook the night.
Glare on red glare, the ridges rose in fire.
The loud steel tempest billowing into light
Tossed to the stars the spray of death’s
desire.
The mountains fell. The forest’s waving
boughs
Were tossed like feathers on the battle wind.
Pallid, the sweat of terror on their brows,
Men stooped in crumbling trenches far be-
hind.
Time ticked its moments by the clock of
death.
They waited in that valor of despair
With hard-clenched hands and laboring of
cold breath
The task the hero and the fool must share.
Sudden the call was heard. Up-staggering,
hoarse.
Tears in their blinded eyes, they faced the
fear.
Hot ruin scourging for their feet a course.
They passed with prayer and oath and chok-
ing cheer.
Blade clashed on blade in darkness. Foe
and foe
Grappled in mad. red horror in the night.
Where the black shadows crouched beneath
the glow
Of starry shells that burst in middle flight.
Shrieks pierced the thunder. Groans of
dying men
Made on the gr'ound a monotone of pain.
The trampled earth was as a glutted fen
Seething and rank beneath that bloody rain.
The Christ came there—a presence and a
peace.
The dying reached to Him their failing
hands.
The awful discord seemed to moan and cease.
The war rolled back across the wasted lands.
Last, silence grew out of the fading roar.
The flames died down in black and acrid
smoke;
And through a red rift in the cloudv door
The morning over hill and vallev broke.

Great was the quiet of the battle’s pause.
The Christ with far, still eyes stood gazing

Into the heart of things where, cause on

Creeps the slow pain that makes the nations
weep.
He saw the avid pomp of little kings.
The biting hunger in the citv’s slum.
The gilded wrong that ever lightly flings
Its cloak to hide a foulness pent and dumb.

He marked His solemn servants faintlv

THE FLYING BAGMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A mile down, Emu Plains glowed in the
bright sunshine, all rectangular plots of cul-
tivation. stretches of pasture parcelled out
in little fields as you see in England, and
dark belts of native forest. The ribbon of
the Nepean fluttered along the foot of the
Mountains, emerging from the deep gorge
where the Warragamba joins it, and
meandering down to the Colo, where it
makes a right-angle, and alters course,
easterly, to the Pacific. Thirty miles or so
behind us its long smoke-bank hides Sydney,
and, away ahead, across the rolling relief-
map of the ranges, a white splash on the
deep indigo of the Blue Mountains marks the
position of Katoomba and its diffuse suburb
of Leura. The Great Western railway
stretches its narrow track across the river
above tbe old ford, and winds up the ridge
that Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson
climbed in lSlo, making a great loop to the
south before it resumes its westerly course
at Glenbrook. Those mighty cuttings in the
new deviation are only small yellow scars in
the blue-green forest.
The humming, roaring, vibrating engine
drew us up over the tumbled chaos of the
mountains. Seven thousand feet, said the
aneroid, and we were past Valley Heights,
and about as far from Springwood in direc-
tion as in elevation, when we wheeled round
on a slope and made back towards the aero-
drome at Richmond. Out along the Grose
Valley-road—an out-track down a long ridge
—in its two-acre clearing, the red roof and
white walls of Norman Lindsay’s bear-
garden, birthplace of the versatile Billy
Bluegl t m. marked the spot where that pleas-
ant gentleman deals out disrespect to the
llun-gorilla. paints pictures, constructs
statuary, and keeps fowls. A white speck
on Ham Common 14 miles away, the big gal-
vanised-iron aerodrome marks our home
port, which, at an easy pace of 80 miles an
hour, we will reach in 10 minutes.
As we sped homeward across those lovely
lands so far below us, the writer fell a-
dreaming.
He thought he was a steel-lined whisky-
traveller calling at the main pubs between
Sydney and Bourke. Or maybe it was boots,
or Manchesters, or rolled oats, or sheep-dip
that sent him winging it out over mountain
and plain with samples and order-book. He
supposed himself to be the up-to-date, look-
out-or-he’ll-sell-you-something, very courteous,
persuasive and persistent drummer of the
not distant future, engaged upon his lawful
occasions in the furtherance of trade and the
development of industry.
From the distillery, or the factory, or the
laboratory that was tariff-protected and
stable he had climbed into the heavens after
breakfast. Behind him was his trusty pilot
—one who never got drunk or trifled with
hotel chambermaids, and was a sober, alert
and greasy-fingered young mechanic who
knew the air-trails better than a Sydney
taxi-driver knows his streets and his traffic
laws. Down Waterloo way the institution
was located, and 15 minutes after starting
we had landed in Liverpool at the fine aero-
drome beside George’s River. Three-quarters
of an hour had sufficed for all the business
that was to be done in Macquarie’s old town,
and another quarter had seen him selling
the wares he trafficked in to the publicans
or shopkeepers of Penrith. And then up
into the glorious morning again, smoking the
good cigar of a generous customer behind
the celluloid wind screen —very high up. so
as to dodge the eddies from the canons of
the Blue Mountains—and 10 minutes saw
him at work in Springwood. Lawson.
Katoomba. Blackheath. Mount Victoria
and Lithgow are dealt with during the fore-
noon and we lunch in Bathurst. We sleep
in Dubbo that night, having traded with
Orange. Wellington and Xarromine in the
course of a leisurely afternoon. The follow-
ing night we perch on the Darling plains
beside Bourke, having eaten our midday mem
as we flew low across the long levels of the
West. And we are back in Sydney tor
lunch on the following day. after a comfort-


able, Quiet and easy-going business journey
across New South Wales.
The subsequent day we go north, to Wal-
-1 ngarra, and, two days after that, are boost-
ing the necessaries of life in Albury. Next
week we take a day’s run out to Broken Hill
t» establish an agency, and are back by the
shores of Botany Bay by sunset on the fol-
lowing evening. We feel remarkably well
and free from fatigue, for there is no' doubt
that this luxurious travel in the pure air
of the higher altitudes is conducive to good
health. At the factory we learn that our
representative in Newcastle has temporarily
relinquished business for the hectic pleasures
of a jag. “Shake him up!” says the boss.
So, in half an hour or so, we are at Port
Hunter, spend more time than he is worth
in hunting up and terrifying our fat-headed
fellow-worker, and sight the earth-lights of
the factory aerodrome about half-past eight
in the evening. The train journey into Syd-
ney is a most insufferable fatigue by contrast
with the light and pleasant Sittings which
have constituted the day’s work.
In the smoking-room of the Commercial
Travellers' Club, old Hilary Bing, lately of
Bayonet Whisky, Ltd., dips his red nose
into his 10th glass of the opposition firm’s
yellow dope, and sighs regrets for the old
days.
“Yes,” he grumbles, “it’s different now.
Five years back th’ Firm had three travel-
lers on each of the three main lines of rail-
way and their branches. What’s th’ game
now? Why one cock-sparrow, hardly
out of his teens, does the three lines on his
pat! How th’ blazes is a man to live in
such times?”
The Curtis leans over to one side, and you
lean the other way, following the instinct to
balance. Far down below—--7000 feet down—
is the white aerodrome. The machine swoops
to the left in a spiral nose-dive that tilts the
horizon up in a grotesque and unnatural
fashion, and the engine stops, only the rush
of the ’plane keeping the propeller twirling
as you corkscrew slowly—that is, compara-
tively slowly—down to earth. You climb
out of the ’plane—conscious of the largeness
of your feet, and the frailty of the varnished
linen stretched across the wings-r-with a
feeling of certain assurance that the day of
the Flying Bagman is very close at hand.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Roar from the Ballot-box.
It is, at the time of writing, the emphasis of
the repudiation rather than the rejection of
the Ministerial proposals with regard to
so-called Conscription which lingers as a sur-
prise. Heavily handicapped by the burden
of a blundering, hysterical, abusive Jonah,
the case for compulsory service has all along
been prejudiced and the war effort of the
country hampered. Only by some miracle
could the opposition stirred up by Hughes’s
reckless violence have been prevented from
finding expression in hostility to the cause of
which, by manoeuvring in holes and corners,
he had become the head and front. And
miracles are not happening nowadays. How-
ever, there the vote is. and William Hughes
can look at his handiwork ; also those men
who. in defiancte of experience, permitted him
to fasten himself upon the country as its
“leader,” can contemplate the result and
explain what they think of it. But what
is going to happen next? We are more con-
cerned about that. It pleased Hughes re-
cently to threaten the people that unless they
voted “Yes” he would wash his hands of his
pledges—that if compulsory service did not
come through the referendum it would be
introduced some other way. Hughes is ill-
balanced enough to do anything. But he has
saner colleagues who will, it is hoped, at last
assert themselves and take steps to prevent
the little mischief-maker setting a match to
a powder-magazine. Having appealed to
ChESAR, and O.ESAR having answered, we
must put up with the consequences. Only
one power can undo what was done last
week ; and that power is the people. The
sooner there is an appeal to them the better
—not on a question surrounded by trickery,
but as to whether they will have an admin-
istration conducted by those who now stand
for “No.”

The March Past.
Time stands to take the salute as the troops
of 1917 march to the place where the
Past is coaled up for the long voyage to
Oblivion. First in the ranks move the long
ragged lines of the Sorrows. Crepe on arm
and with tattered colors drooping, they limp
slowly by. Long casualty lists, big hopes
that had no fulfilment and black shadows
gathering—the' closing year will be remem-
bered as one of grim suffering and strange
terrors that passed very near to the deeps
of despair. According to Kitchener, we
were to begin seriously hammering the Ger-
mans in the last months of 1917. But
if we hammered ' them a little we
did not break them; ‘ and they re-
turned blow for blow. Russia—the road-
roller —has become a mere discordant babbie
of voices; Roumania is gone; nothing has
happened in the Balkans; I ranee has been
brought almost to a standstill. For such as
this we have paid a fearful price m blood and
tears. Even the impassive face of lime is
heavy as the troops of Sorrow go by. But close
upon their heels, with buoyant step, comes
the legion of Achievement. With all its
blighted hopes. 1917 cannot be talked down
as a year of failure. Very solidly and
menacingly the British might has grown
on that big testing-ground we call the
Western Front. In battle after battle
the Teuton has been proved inferior to the
Briton, and has learned a grim respect tor a
foe that could accomplish under the strain
of war miracles which in their way eclipse
his own preparations through the. years of
peace. In two Asiatic theatres British arms
have steadily triumphed, and the taking of
Jerusalem is a deed of magnitude. The last
remnant of the German overseas possessions
is in our hands; and even the submarine
danger looks a little less formidable. Time
never in all his years saw quite such a troop
as this ; and when it is recalled that practi-
cally every member of the corps enlisted
since August, 1914, there is reason for the
pride in their bearing. Follow the Hopes,
with a light in their eyes that is good for
victory. With all its failures, 1917 closes with
promise. Man for man, the Teutons know
that the Allies are their masters; and the
most desperate rally of the Kaiser’s legions
will ne\er shake the great confidence
that France and England who have held
them so long can hold them still. The new
shipbuilding efforts will relieve the menace
of the submarine; the British navy is
stronger than ever and as ready as ever for
a new Trafalgar. And, above all, there is
the sober preparation of America to enter
the war. The last footsteps die away, and
a strong faith remains that the white banner
of peace will flutter in the next procession.
The Pill with the Coat Rubbed Off.
In orations immediately preceding the poll
Prime Minister Hughes made a point of
the woe awaiting Australia if, as the result
of a German victory, the Commonwealth had
to give German manufacturers a free market
for their goods. Hughes knows very well
that this is only a small instalment of what
Australia would be up against in the event
of Germany fixing the terms of peace. But
take Hughes’s statement as it stands as
an appeal to the Protectionist. What does
it amount to? No Australian Protectionist
who understands his doctrine can show that
at rock bottom there is any difference between
the free admission of German and other goods
to Australia. They both mean the same
thing. There is no more reason to dread the
consequences of admitting German manu-
factures free and paying for them than of
getting the same things in more ample quan-
tity with a p.n. and going through the joke
of putting up the price to the consumer by
levying a tax on the goods, and thus raising
revenue and filling the warehouse by the
same loan operation. The truth is that the
Protection Australia has had against foreign
goods has been more or less a fiction, and
always must be so while the country goes
on living above its means and hypothecating
its credit. Every million borrowed abroad
means a million’s worth of goods. It is
true that the tariff has allowed certain indus-
tries a chance to start into life; but it is
also true that the'y have in the main rested
on the insecure foundation of boom created
by borrowing. In what way would the
interests of Australia be more damaged by
admitting free, say, £5,000,000 worth of paid-
for German goods than by getting six times
the volume of goods from various other
places, putting a duty on them, and promising
to pay 5 per cent, per annum until the next
generation had liquidated the bill? There is
only one ans\yer. Australia has never had
Protection from the German or anyone else,
nor ever will by the dodge of framing a tariff
schedule and then rushing to Cohen for
ways and means of throwing it out of gear.
The country’s problem in the past was to
satisfy the national requirements by local
effort, paying the bill for anything not avail-
able on the premises—and doing it all out
of the national earnings. The problem to-
day is no different.
The Human Longing to Silence the
Other Talker.
That Cabinet memorandum of Holman’s
which drove the No contingent to fury in
the last lap was a queer illustration of the
yearning that takes possession of the elected
person to give censors a job. This is par-
ticularly the case with democrats. As a
rule, the monarchical and aristocratic sys-
tems produce individuals who, if the common
herd go to church regularly, refrain from
composing critical verse and circulating ribald
cartoons, generally show a wide tolerance of
opinion. Among young democracies the
man thrown to the top finds himself nine
times out of 10 panting to throttle someone
and devise methods for stereotyping public
thought. The newspaper is, by this indi-
vidual, secretly loathed, and he spends at
least a substantial part of each waking day
devising methods for handing it a whiff of
chloroform. Holman, for instance, if the
memorandum expressed his wishes, did not
want to see the newspapers giving the com-
munity a fair account of what was happen-
ing at the Front, discussing the progress of
the war in the light of an ample public
understanding, or criticising the administra-
tive end of the business. He wanted a law
compelling the newspapers to print columns
of dope “selected” by censors and other
professional manufacturers of soothing
syrup. What he expected was to be gained
by this, Heaven only knew at the time; but
even Holman himself knows now what the
result would have been, for it is just such a
system as this that Australia has really
been working under for the best part of
three years. Looking back over that time
and surveying the drivel the Australian press
was, if not actually compelled to print about
the war, at least coerced into publishing, is
like contemplating the misspent days of
youth. The hand of the Censor was heavy
on the land and the consequences to the pub-
lic mind wholly disastrous. But men of the
Holman type can only bring themselves to
see the evils of a censorship when somebody
else is exercising it. On the other hand, it
can be said with complete confidence that the
people who yell the loudest against the anaes-
thetic in the other fellow’s power could them-
selves be relied on to use it just as frequently.
Tolerance is a rare virtue. And in this con-
nection it can never be forgotten that it was
a Labor Ministry which gave Australia the
War Precautions Act and all that came of
it. The Bulletin has no doubt, judging
by the glee with which this Act was passed
and the venom w-ith which anyone who dared
to advocate an extension of compulsory mili-
tary service has been pursued, that the men
who in another camp are the most fervent
advocates of free discussion would be just
as ready to dragoon the public with a cen-
sorship if they had a chance. The only
difference would be that they would try to
shut every mouth but their own, instead of
conforming to what the other person ordered.
Give a man a brief authority and the pre-
cariousness of his hold upon it is almost
invariably the measure of his anxiety to give
a tinpot imitation of the Great Mogul.
Cocky and His Wheat.
With a view to exposing the “malicious
statements” made by some unspecified per-
sons who with “sickening, hypocritical cant”
had been “playing the dirty game of Ger-
many,” Prime Minister Hughes last week
threw a mass of figures into the newspapers
about the wheat pool. The purpose was to
show that by selling the Australian farmer’s
wheat for him at 4s. 9d. a good deal had been
made; that the British Government by buy-
ing Canadian wheat at 9s. 2d. had found
the transaction more profitable than paying
4s. 9d. for Australian; that it was untrue to
say that the British Government had made
large profits out of the Australian trans-
actions. In support Hughes quoted the pre-
vailing. rates of freight between _ certain
countries, and arrived at the conclusion that
if these had to be paid on Australian wheat
by private shippers now the current London
quotation would leave a net return of only
Is. per bushel. And in the main
Hughes is right. The Australian farmer
has been paid for wheat which, as events
have turned out, would have been absolutely
unsaleable had not John Bull previously
become the buyer and taken the risk of
transport. But neither Hughes when he
started the pool, nor the British Govern-
ment when it bought the wheat, nor anyone
else in the wide world, expected that thou-
sands of tons of vegetables were going to
be stranded at this end of the transaction.
The criticism levelled against the manage-
ment was that for some occult reason the
Australian wheat-grower’s produce was sold
cheaper than Canadian and Argentine wheat.
And so it was. The allegation that this was
accounted for by high freights is no more
true than that someone or other was not
making an immense profit—probably the
British Government. A statement of
accounts showing the transactions of the
Victorian Wheat Commission to June, 1917,
reveals that 27,565,011 bushels were sold in
London at an average of 6s. 3d., and that
the charges for freight, commission, ex-
change, insurance and so on were Is. 7d. a
bushel. Now, during the greater part of
this time the market price of wheat in Lon-
don and Liverpool ranged from 9s. to 10s.
3d. a bushel. What people who were neither
“malicious” nor “playing a dirty game”
wanted to know during that time was—
why? And why did Hughes sell 20,000,000
bushels of Australian wheat in one line at
4s. f.o.b. when the English consumer was
paying Os. and when freight, etc., did not
eat up more than Is. 7d.? It is no
answer to say that the march of events has
justified the 'pool. The happenings of this
year are not the tests to apply to what
occurred previously, nor do the freights of
3017 explain the transactions of 1915 and
1910. The available facts all go to justify
the general contention of the Prime Minister
that Australian wheatgrowers have been
lucky. But to say that until the torpedo
began to work it was more profitable for
Britain to pay Canada 9s. 2d. for wheat than
trt buy in Australia at 4s. 9d. is merely silly.
The whole truth is that Britain got a lot of
ridiculously cheap wheat from Australia, and
bought a lot more which will be mighty dear
because it will never be shifted.
“Bows” speaks from the bridge:—
A Judge the other day in a Sydney court com-
mented regretfully on the large proportion of
foreigners composing the crew of a certain vessel
which had been in trouble. Another wigged gent, a
month or two back, whilst holding an inquiry into a
stranding, made somewhat similar remarks. But
neither lawyer seemed to be able to point a way out.
As long as we refuse to compel shipowners to carry
boys for deck-\tork there will be little hope of ever
finding half enough Australians to man Australian
vessels. Some vessels carry one or two ordinary sea-
men, who, of course, must have had some seafaring
experience (in the eyes Of the law, not less than two
years’ service). From an educational point of view,
these don’t count. IVe must compel ships to carry
boys and so bring up our own ordinary and able-
seamen. Under present conditions, if a seaman dies
or leaves Australia he must be replaced from
abroad; and as there has been any time this last 30
years a notorious shortage of British seamen in
British ships, in three cases out of four he will be
replaced by an alien.
In the stokehole things are different. An able
young man without seafaring experience may be, and
often is, signed on in the larger coasting vessels as
a trimmer, so it is not uncommon to find a fair pro-
portion of Australian natives as firemen.
In the same way the engine-rooms of Australian
steamers are practically manned by Australian
engineers owing to the facilities the various shops
offer boys to serve their time. But on deck, there
being no thorough apprentice system in our ships,
most of our deck officers and masters are importa-
tions, and many of them hail from alien countries.
If a certain country is drawn into this war on the
side of Germany, Australian ships will either go to
sea seriously shorthanded or else be manned by
duffers.
The poor, dilapidated old Party mule was
trotted out again last week for public in-
spection, and never before looked so miser-
able. No question was ever so far from
party as that over which the Australian
people had been wrangling for a month or
so. Yet there was Joe Cook dragging up
out of the forgotten past particulars of how
Frank Tudor voted on the Australian navy
issue, Tudor feebly calling upon Australia
to rally round Labor and vote “No,”
Hughes yelling that the choice was between
him and the Devil, and 423 minor indi-
viduals roaring that the vote was a party
vote and the side which got the least sup-
port at the ballot was for ever damned.
Apart altogether from the merits of the
question there was an indecency about all
this almost incredible. The theory of the
various spruikers seemed to be that upon
every patriotic citizen there devolved a duty
of either giving the P.L.L. a punch or
stoushing W. Hughes as a preliminary to
dealing with the Kaiser. Whether the Ger-
man Imperial crocodile cares 2d. about the
P.L.L. or Hughes is a question on which
this paper has no information ; but it has a
strong suspicion that if, in the intervals of
dropping a tear for the widows and orphans
of the Fatherland, and ordering bombs to be
deposited on the kids elsewhere, the brute
hears of what transpired at this end of the
world, it will reckon that a vanity greater
than ever inflated a Hohenzollern prince can
take possession of a democracy. That the
piffling squabbles between a few dozen place-
hunters hungry for authority and patronage
should be so magnified would at any other
time have seemed incredible. Yet a divinity
or something shapes our ends, and if from
this wretched debauch of partisan rancor
the Australian people have learned what
Party really is—to appreciate how destruc-
tive of even their own local liberties it may
be —then will they begin to get a grasp of
what democratic government actually means.

“Cato'* in reply to Randolph Bedford
(B. 13/12/H7) : —-
(1) Bedford complains because I stated that
Ryan and co. had more concern for cheap chops
than for reinforcements. We are told that Mr. Ryan
and Mr. Hunter appeared on a recruiting plat-
form only to be insulted. Nobody glories in the
foolish manner in which these Ministers were treated.
But when a Government opposes the only decent
method of getting recruits, and does not even follow
the example of private firms and the N. S. Wales
Government in giving its servants the difference
between A.I.F. pay and their salaries, there is
nothing harsh about a reference to its preference for
cheap chops. For the Government is concerned for
cheap chops.
(2) Bedford refers to Ministers who have sent
sons to the war. I cannot remember a single in-
stance of any public declamation that the individual
Ministers lack patriotic spirit. Bedford is over-
sensitive on the point. But when Australia’s war
policy is made a question of party politics, and every
Labor member in Queensland has acquiesced in the
Anti-Conscriptionist leading of Trades Hall, why
should Bedford squeal when anybody says his party
is not playing the game?
(3) Bedford states that the Government is not
addicted to Funk. He says it settled a strike with-
out compromise and without giving away the law.
If the reference is to the northern railway strike, he
talks through his hat. The northern railwavmen
refused to abide by the decision of the State Arbi-
tration Court, and struck. The Government was not
game to back up the Court, but compromised by
getting the men to start work on a promise that
their dispute would be settled before a Judge
borrowed from the outside world. As a matter of
fact, the unions settled the northern strike. Southern
unions came to the aid of the Government. But a
Government that erects Arbitration machinery and
then runs around the continent and swims to Maori-
land for a Judge to settle its disputes is suffering
from Funk.
The Year’s End.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The voices of the wind and wave
They sigh the Old Year’s requiem ;
The dead are calling from the grave
Good friends, a little space I crave
To turn aside and think df them.
They were as even you and I
When you and I were young as they;
And yet they knew the way to die —
Come, think with me, and tell me why
It should be thus with hearts so gay.
Ah, blessed be the gracious God
Who, moulding us from clay and dew,
From morning dew and clay untrod,
So breathed Himself into the sod
That we, at best, grow Godlike, too.
For, treading pleasure underneath,
These glory-souls, our country’s flower,
They rose responsive to that breath
And looked into the face of Death,
And did not tremble at his power.
Should it not make us sure and tough
As tested steel, and unafraid,
To feel, though Fate ride robber-rough,
That we are fashioned of the stuff
Whereof these heroes, too, were made?
Though they are dead and o’er them bends
A people’s soul in mourning mood,
Proud Honor at their grave attends:
Henceforth we are a nation, friends,
By right of sacrificial blood.
The care-free days of youth are gone;
What once we were no more we are;
And dead are all the dreams that shone
Ere we were bruised and hammered on
The ringing anvils of red war.
The Spirit of Immortal Times,
With lights that dazzle and entice,
Is vitalising all earth’s climes;
Once more in golden tones it chimes
The anthem of High Sacrifice.
And yet, though Fame be very fair,
And great the yearning and desire
Of hero-hearts to do and dare,
Behold, their stands an empty chair
Beside a cold and ashen fire!
Because, as even you and I,
They loved and were beloved, my friends,
Not all the glory-stars on high,
The splendid things for which men die,
Can for their passing make amends.
There is a house that waits in vain
To give them entrance at its door,
When frost’s afoot or chilly rain ;
There is a track across the plain
That they, alas, shall ride no more.
A whip, a saddle and a spur!
(Ah, love-lit rides! The moon above,
Sweet scents around, soft winds astir!)
God give him rest! And what of her?
Why ask? Is love not always love?
Dear eyes that pain has made divine,
Sad eyes that burn with tears unshed,
Within whose depths are griefs that pine
And pilgrim thoughts that seek the shrine,
The grave of their beloved dead ;
Dear eyes, dear hearts, dear folk, tear-blind,
Who greet each morn with grief anew,
Pale cheeks grown cold, and foreheads
lined, —
Since God is good and Heaven is kind,
There shall be recompense for you !
The Old Year dies: and o’er the waves,
Wind-borne, there comes a requiem
Deep-chanted by a sea that laves
The shores they loved. Oh, may their graves
Give goodly rest and peace to them !

The Fourth Christmas of War.
A report received by way of Amsterdam
pictures Berlin turning handsprings over the
Russian peace or whatever it may be. Re-
ports from Amsterdam are something like
the “telegrams from Petrograd” in the dear
old times when we were all three years
younger and correspondingly credulous. Yet
this yarn about hilarity at Berlin may well
he true. Most of the joy may be manufac-
tured ; yet viewed from the Boche’s angle the
collapse of Russia is a big thing. It means
not only the elimination of an enemy, but a
strengthening of the German arms against
other enemies. Coupled with this story
about popular rejoicings comes the state-
ment of a Socialist member of the Reichstag
that the military leaders in the Fatherland
are “drunk with visions of victory.” If this
is somewhere about right it is reasonable to
fear that the break-up of the Central Powers,
of which we have been hearing for three
years and three months, has been postponed.
In any ease, it is merely foolish to look upon
the military position in Europe to-day as not
being more favorable to the German than at
any other period since the campaign of 1914.
What is happening in Italy is not altogether
clear, except that the defence is being hard-
pressed and all hands are praying for winter
to take possession of the northern passes.
The feeding of the Italian armies has appa-
rently become a question of some difficulty,
though probably more easy to settle than
the enemy Will be when he gets busy again
in the Spring. The forces opposed to Italy
will most certainly be then heavily reinforced
with men and guns drawn from what used
to be the Eastern Front. Northern France
and Belgium are again under snow. There
will be hard times there and perhaps hard
fighting in the slush, for inducements to Yon
Hindenbuf.g to do his worst without delay
are substantial. Time is not on his side in
that section. Not only is L T ncle Sam coming,
but Britain is getting ready for a further call
upon the nation’s manhood. The day is very
near when every man and woman in Eng-
land will be either fighting or working for
the common cause —a reflection which doesn’t
make it any easier to swallow the pill the
Australian voters compounded last Thurs-
day.
• ♦
In the midst of cursing Hughes for a
bungler and looking round for somebody to
take his place, there is a good Australian
who is liable to be overlooked, and his name
is Billjim. In many cases he is a tired
Billjim, with wounds yet hardly healed,
and he is doing two men’s work and taking
more than two men’s risks, because the
required reinforcements have not gone to his
relief. The No-Conscriptionists say that
volunteers in sufficient numbers can be got.
It is their business now to get them. Nor is
it any less the business of those who voted
Yes, because they professed to be even more
solicitous about reinforcing Bill. For a
month past the newspapers have been filled
with the reports of the struggle to get votes.
Suppose now that an equal struggle is made
to get recruits. For over a month it has
taken columns of print every day to give
even a list of the meetings called to recruit
voters. Suppose now that an equal effort
is made to recruit reinforcements. It is
little to our credit that hundreds of men
who have taken the stump to bring citizens
to the polling-place because they said that
voluntary recruiting had failed, have never
said a public word to bring citizens to the
recruiting-depdt and prevent that failure.
Almost a year ago a State Premiers’ Con-
ference was held in Melbourne to finalise
the agreements under which the Common-
wealth was to take over the work of re-
patriating Billjim. A Repatriation Bill
was introduced to the Senate and passed by
both Houses, the Act to operate from a
date to be proclaimed. Millen became
Minister of Repatriation, and later Lockyer,
of the fizzled Inter-State Commission, was
made Controller. By this time it would not
be unreasonable to expect the Government’s
scheme, if it has one, to have been estab-
lished ; in fact, a private business carrying
two expensive heads like Senator Millen
and Nicholas Lockyer would be running
on ball-bearings in a mere month or two.
What of Australia’s great repatriation
scheme? Well, to begin with, the Repatria-
tion Act has never been proclaimed.
Further, all the repatriation work in the six
States is still being undertaken by State
officers. When the Federal Act is pro-
claimed. the Repatriation Minister will
seemingly have to find his own staff, the
loaned officers passing back into their old
State-service jobs again. In which case the
experts with several years’ experience, who
have been wrestling with the difficulties of
the problem, are to be dropped for appointees
who will have to learn all about it. If the
Federal Government cannot or does not
want to secure the services of these State
officers it should not delay in organising the
staff that will have to carry the full weight
of the scheme. The future of Australia s
300,000-odd best citizens now under arms is
too precious to be jeopardised by official
bungling.
About the wildest yarn in circulation last
week was a rigmarole that the employment
of ships to carry troops from Australia
represented a treacherous dissipation of
tonnage in the interests of the enemy. “If,”
ran the yarn, “the vessels to take 7000
troops a month from Australia were used
by America. 49.000 soldiers could be landed
in France monthly from the United States.’
The simple answer is that unless the Aus-
tralian sick and wounded are sent from
England to N’York or kept in the vicinity
of the Thames, transports must bring them
home to the Commonwealth. And the trans-
ports must either go back again loaded or
make the journey empty so far as the troop-
ship accommodation is concerned. They
are vessels fitted specially for the service.
To pull the innards out of them every time
they reach Australia so that they could be
filled to the decks with wheat would make
the cost of handling, already enormous, prac-
tically ruinous. Tiie Bulletin can under-
stand objections among the voluntaryists to
going to the Front, but it can’t understand
people putting obstacles in the way of bring-
ing our injured lads home.
“Murkah’s” suggestion
The frequent accounts of privations in open boats
(the torpedoed Rochester provided the latest in-
stance) suggest that ships should carry a small wire-
less set, complete in a case, which could be installed
in, or transferred to, one of the boats before launch-
ing. A complete transmitter, including a hand-
driven dynamo, telescopic masts for aerial, aerial
wires, etc., capable of transmitting up to about 100
miles, and a receiver—all can be packed in a case
less than 2ft. square. While in the danger zone such a
set could be hooked up to an auxiliary aerial and
kept as a stand-by in ease of accident to the main
set. As mentioned in Plain English recently, de-
pending on one aerial is a dangerous and stupid
proceeding. I once sailed with a man who argued
that ships should not carry boats —that if anything
happened the ship the best thing was to get the
misery over. He once spent two weeks in a boat.
The accounts of sufferings so often reported lately
make me think his contention wasn’t so silly as it
sounded at the time.
♦
Does.the mental patient get a square deal?
Some months ago Chief Secretary Donald
McLeod promised Vic. Labor-leader Billson
that there would be a thorough inquiry into
the case of a deceased patient on whose
body the doctors had discovered traces of
violence which the asylum authorities could
not or would not explain. A week or so
ago the N. S. Wales force got rid of a con-
stable who had been convicted of brutally
ill-using a prisoner. And here is the
significant fact: this violent young Hop
had had recent experience as a hospital
attendant. Did he merely make the mis-
take of applying to a sane man, who could
be called as a witness, the methods learnt
in dealing with the insane who have not
this protection? Public confidence in the
humanity of the asylum system will begin
to wane if the curtain keeps on blowing aside
in this way.

Ten years in Papua :
Papua was handed over by the Imperial Govern-
ment in 1906 ; so this is a convenient time, after 10
years’ operations, to take stock.
Our figures are still far too small. Exports last
year were only £125,500; imports were £223,000,
and admittedly that isn’t healthy. But we are still
in the development stage, and very much of our
expenditure is on capital account. Nevertheless,
since the Commonwealth took possession imports
have risen 250 p.c. and exports 200 p.c. The in-
crease is principally due to the extension of the
planting industry. Mining has proceeded much more
slowly.
When the Commonwealth flag was hoisted in 1906
the area under cocoanuts was only 1400 acres; this
has risen to over 34,000 acres, an extension of more
than 24 acres for every acre planted when Australia
took over from Downing-street. Para-rubber, of
which only a negligible area was planted in 1906,
now occupies 7671 acres and promises to be the
most lucrative proposition in tropical culture. Hemp,
of the Mexican sisal variety, is responsible for 5000
acres, an increase of 100 acres for every acre culti-
vated in 1906. Tobacco, a new crop, is being
grown on 200 acres, and the leaf is manufactured in
the Territory. The total area under plantations in
1906 was only 1467 acres. Last year 47.560 acres
were under cocoanuts, rubber, hemp, tobacco and
minor products, an increase of 46,039 acres in the
decade. This acreage is divided among 243 planta-
tions. Some two millions of Australian money are
invested in the properties.
The imports were mainly foodstuffs, drapery, hard-
ware, machinery, clothing, boots and leather goods,
timber and oils.
The principal exports last year were gold (bullion
and ore) £43,000, copra £19,000, rubber £15,000,
copper ore £lO,OOO, hemp £12,000, trochas shell
£6OOO, cotton £l6OO, pearls £lOOO, sandalwood
£l4OO. bSche-de-mer £3OOO and maize £soo—a
list which shows the Territory to be equal to any
other part of the Empire in diversity of products.
Such things as bark, canes, timber and gums are
still hardly touched, but in years to come will be a
big factor. At present they are passed by owing to
the difficulty and expense of transport. With the
exception of a few hundred pounds, the rubber was
all plantation grown, and in competition in the
world’s markets it realised top prices. The coming
year should witness at least double the production.
The export of copra will also increase as the planta-
tions opened in 1907 and 1908 come into the produc-
ing stage. At least 5000 acres were due to give
their first crop this current year, and the value of
next year’s crop will be greater again. ' The future
of this industry is very bright.
The world upheaval has affected settlement con-
siderably, but with peace Papua should get her share
of attention from investors driven out of the older
lands by post-war taxation. Both rubber and cocoa-
nuts are an attractive proposition to the man with
limited capital and lots of energy; and Papua has
plenty of rich land for this type of settler.
Given free entry for her products into Australia,
Papua could supply all the tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar,
maize, sago, tapioca, gum and kapok which the
Commonwealth now buys from Java and other foreign
countries. And instead of assisting pro-Germans and
other undesirables, she would be trading with her-
self; for the development of Papua is in her own
hands—though the average Australian doesn’t realise
it yet.
It isn’t the Labor strongholds that earn
the bitterest contempt on the question of
Conscription and reinforcements. The prize
belongs to some of the “Liberal” country dis-
tricts. There is Burramine South, for in-
stance, in the north-east Murray country
(Vic.), of which Tungamah is the centre,
with the terrible distinction of not having
sent a single soldier to the Front. Tunga-
mah used to be a Liberal stronghold even
in the days when Labor was at its zenith,
while at the recent State elections the vot-
ing throughout that corner of Victoria was
largely Liberal —enough, at any rate, to
keep all local Labor candidates out of Par-
liament. But it has been giving its heart-
felt support, in cash, yells and rotten eggs,
to the Labor propaganda in opposition to
the reinforcements proposals. When Labor
finds itself getting this sort of support it
can make dead-certain that it is on the wrong
track.
The worst fault of the Defence Depart-
ment is that it doesn't give itself or any-
body else time for calm reflection. You no
sooner say you’ve got an idea for winning
the war than it rushes you off your feet to
get it. George Austin, of the Vic. Institute
of Architects, came forward, shortly after
the war began, w T ith particulars of a heavier-
than-air flier, allegedly uncapsizable. In
those days he made an effort to catch the
public eye with modest window-displays in
the suburbs. Later on there was a public
trial at Heidelberg of an Austin model,
which was set free to fly by itself. It flew
all right, and didn’t upset until it hit a
tree. Now, not more than three years after
Austin announced that he had this idea, the
Defence Department is going to submit
specifications to the British authorities.
You’d almost think, from this precipitancy,
that the Defence Department wanted to icin
the blessed war.
A worried returning-ofEcer has been curs-
ing the place where C. J. Dennis rusticates.
He had fixed up a private house as a polling-
booth for the few r stray citizens who nest
amongst the tall timber at Toolangi. and the
ballot-box and voting papers had been depo-
sited there. Then scarlet-fever broke out in
the house, and a new booth had to be
scratched up and the ballot-box and papers
carefully disinfected.
The exiled Belgian art-collector and
expert, Cels, is dead in Adelaide at the
early age of 36. His collection of paintings
I—which1 —which he reckoned enormously valuable—
is still in Sydney, for he was lucky enough
to get it away when he lost everything else
in the Hun invasion. He fought for his
country till he was wounded and gassed, and
then proposed to make Australia his home.
Adelaide Art Gallery is awaiting with some
interest the result of inquiries he made, on
a return trip to Europe this year, into an
unknown picture which it picked up long
ago when R.C. Archoishop Reynolds’s effects
were dispersed. Cels, on seeing it, suggested
that it was something very good and valu-
able. lie wrote from Europe that he had
found out all about it in Paris; but when he
came back he was in a dying condition, and
nobody seems to know where to find the
verdict that he had gleaned.

Allan Wilkie is having a hot time in “For
the King,’ a new Cromwellian disturbance
which reached the Melbourne Princess’s on
Saturday. Allan appears as the Cavalier
Captain Harry Clavering, and it is his duty
to make the Roundheads look like Block
heads and earn the warm favor of Charles I
The gallant warrior suffers terribly for his
allegiance, and is savagely biffed in his
struggles with Colonel Stephen Wenlock a
large and nasty Ironside who covets M rs
Clavering and achieves rare mischief in the
name of the Lord. Wenlock twice ambushes
the reckless Clavering, and each time the
Captain is saved by the miraculous resource
of Dick Wildfire, a semi-loony youth who
hugs his trail for the purpose of being handv
in case of trouble. In the first ambush
Richard rescues Clavering’s priceless des-
patches and sends them to the King, while
the hero is grabbed with the object of pro-
viding Wenlock and his men with the oppor-
tunity of attending a funeral. But with
Cromwell’s permission Clavering is allowed
three days to say good-bye to his wife and

cheild, and he leaves his pal, Rupert
Vane, as a hostage for his return. There-
upon the indefatigable Wenlock surprises
him again, and privately mislays him in a
dungeon so that he shall not keep his ap-
pointment. But, ah. ah ! He forgets Wild-
fire. who prizes the hero out of his retire-
ment and returns him to Cromwell. Oliver,
seething with sudden magnanimity, grants
pardons all round. As for Wenlock, he is
carted away and shot for misbehavior un-
becoming a Puritan and a "entleman.
* * * *
The piece is an innocent type of Walter
Howard story, utterly artless and brimming
over with fight and feeling. The stoush is
the most substantial thing in it, barring,
perhaps, the figure of Arthur Styan. who, in
the part of Oliver Cromwell, will satisfy the
most voracious desire for solids. Allan
Wilkie has energv and to spare for the job
of Clavering, and Vivian Edwards can never
get a wink of sleep, so busy is he kept with
the murderous intentions of Captain Wen-
lock. Walter Hunt’s classical features are
borrowed for the role of Rupert Vane, whilst
Eilian Lloyd is not obtrusivelv feminine as
the witless Wildfire. Mrs. Clavering is
played by Miss Olive Wilton, and her little
daughter, whose prayers tickle the fancy of
O. Cromwell, gets a large head of hair from
Dorothy Seacombe. Marie Xey figures as the
beauteous creature-comfort promised to
Rupert aforesaid. Also there is Elwyn
Harvey lavishing more comeliness on Pen-
elope Pennyquick than any reasonable person
has a right to expect.
“Aladdin,” at Melbourne King’s, is a
feast of clothes and curves in 15 courses
that should tickle the light palates of holiday
audiences. The menu is not overburdened
with story, and the characters forget their
purpose therein ; but those are discrepancies
allowable in a show that makes frivolous
irrelevaneies the order of the night. The

best feature, as usual, is the quantity of
gill that gives pictorial weight to many
solos and swarms in marches of patriotic im-
port, filling the stage with color and smile
The scenery, by Clint and Rowell, is also
effective, the sets ranging from a cloisonne
and porcelain palace to a mystic wood where
the weird landscape trembles and goblins
prance to the mutter of drums. In this scene
occurs a pretty effect by several damsels in
the brief ballet skirts of old time coryphees,
whilst the same girleens, or others like them,
furnish a charming poke-bonnet background
to one of Olive Godwin’s songs.
As for the principals, they are likely to
make themselves felt when they have got
properly into their stride. Barry Lupino,
who earns a special prize as producer, capers
whimsically as Abanazar, and is beguiled
into protracted fooling by a rare fund of gags.
Bert Bailey gives Mrs. Twankey the profile
of a Roman emperor and a soft satiny manner
that has periods of droll quiet. Hi’s natural
humor is unstressed in speech, but his ward-
robe runs to quaint extravagances; a hat
decorated with toothbrushes and pocket-
mirrors being an arresting work of art.
Winifred La France, as Aladdin, presents
engaging contours to every angle of vision,
and is not lost in comparison with the tall
Princess (Olive Godwin), whose manifest
comeliness is inhabited by a voice of great
value. Fayette Perry is a fragile sunbeam
as Nicee. who is wooed by the robust Prince
Pekoe of Daisy Revette. In the job of the
Emperor, Andrew Iligginson is a court card
in every sense of the expression, whilst Bert
Barton, as the demon magician, dispenses
frightfulness and croaks threats with con-
siderable emphasis. Fred Macdonald and
John Beck, as two policemen, amount to only
a few abbreviated sentences, and Leslie
Donaghey is once conspicuous as a convul-
sive fraction of the grotesque “Splish-splash-
splosh” chorus in Mrs. Twankey’s kitchen.
Zola Terrell, a barefooted dancer who is all
rippling limbs and undulations, is an im-
ported specialist in sensuous Oriental meas-
ures. A harlequinade happening at the mat-
inees is bound to be popular with the
kiddies; and Heller and Morris, acrobats,
also figure prominently in a performance
that must inevitably grow smarter when
it suffers a reduction in bulk.

The J.C.W. children who began their ver-
sion of the Firmi’s 1916 panto, at Sydney
Royal last Saturday don’t need any excuse
on account of their youth. Perfectly drilled
and tutored, they put on “The House That
.Tack Built” in a finished way that chal-
lenges critical examination, and their show
comes out with honors. It does something
better than satisfy the critic who is old
enough to grow a stubble-beard. It amuses
the youngsters on the other side of the foot-
lights more than the best efforts of adult
players could ever do.

The programme is an interminable list of
girl names. Either the Australian boy
wasn’t wanted or else he refused to be leg-
roped. But the girls (who range from
tall, self-possessed flappers to the nursery
staggerer) manage admirably without them.
Even the red-nosed jobs of Dame, Farmer
Barleycorn, Policeman and Sammy are con-
vincingly played, each Florrie and Phyllis
following carefully in the tracks of the
comedian who went before. As for the
marching and dances, the children there are
comedian who went
before. As for the
marching and
dances, the chil-
dren there are
fairly on their own
playground and
their work is a de-
light to watch.
Eliminate from
this version of the
House the Dame’s
song about gin
being mother’s ruin
(an evident sop
for grown-ups with
degraded tastes),
and a few other ex-
crescences of the
kind, and it will be
the panto, to take
the kiddies to. Even
the special acro-
batic act is by two
little Australian
girls in short
frocks. The solo
dancer (a pocket
Maggie Dickinson)
is little Rita Nu-
gent, who has
already starred in
J.C.W. shows.
“The House That
Jack Built," at
Sydney Royal.
The Dame
( Phyliss Amery).
Florrie Allan (Jack) is a dark-haired,
shapely flapper with a good voice and a fane
stage presence. Una Wauchsmuth (laime
Barleycorn) is the quaint whiskered agri-
culturist. Elsie Campbell (Sammy) cleverly
echoes Harry Roxbury. Rene Hill (police-
man, old suburbanite and veteran duellist)
is a kid with personality and a quiet sense
of humor. Phyliss Porter is a well-grown
Prince Regent. Eileen Dunn (Susetta)
is a miniature Gretchen Yates, with a lot
of that dainty actress’s charm. Phyliss
Amery (Dame) — The Bulletin doesn’t
know why all these Phyllises have two s’s
and one I—is Arthur Stigant to the life.
Thelma Burness ( Madge) is a pretty kid
in Dorothy Firman’s old part. Gladys
Brewer (Fairy Queen), Ren# Briggs (Lord
of Misrule) and Hazel Meldrum (Demon of
Despair) complete the astonishing young
cast. The little chorus people and dancers
do their work joyously without a fault.
Judged by the opening production at the
matinee last Saturday, the Fullers’ panto-
mime, “Robinson
Crusoe of Rainbow
Island.” at Sydney
O pera House, is
much too long.
After 3 hours and
2 0 minutes this
critic fled, leaving
behind him the
Staigs’ motor-cycle
act and various
musical and danc-
ing events. Every
early panto, audi-
ence is the dog that
the management
tries it on, and
there probably
never was a Fido
that didn’t yelp
now and then dur-
ing the process. But
guided by the dog
the management
produces something
presently that the
suburban mil k-o
can attend without
missing a morn-
ing’s job ; and when
the Fullers have
attended to this, as
of course they will,
“Robinson Crusoe”
will prove as great
a success as their

Jack Built," at
Sydney Royal.

first experiment, "The Bunyip.”

The staging is adequate, the music (mostly
locally composed) sufficiently “catchy,” the
incidental variety acts are clever, and the
ballets brightly dressed. The dialogue, how-
ever, needs much pruning. Victor Prince,
the author, is somewhat ludicrous as Robin-
son Crusoe; his wife, the Dame (Walter
Cornock), is hard-working but hardly
humorous; Davy Jones, the Pirate King
(Chas. Zoli), delivers his pirate song with
verve; the three mariners do some clever
tumbling; Percy Clifton and Kennedy Black
make admirable wowsers ; Maud Fanning is
a quite satisfactory cannibal queen, and her
hula-hula scene, with three cannibal girls, is
an attractive bit of work; the beautiful
voices of Olive Sinclair, as a princess, and
Dorothy Hastings, as her lover, provide the
best duet in the show; Nellie Fallon, as the
heroine, is vivacious and possesses a delight-
ful voice with a doubtful pronunciation;
Nellie Kolle, the principal girl, has the voice
and the swagger for the part; and the goat,
the chimpanzee, the microbes and the sea-
nymphs are all up to sample.
** * *
In “The Bird of Paradise,” an American
drama of Hawaiian life, Melbourne Royal
has a drama suited to hot weather. The
story offers vague reminders of several pre-
vious mixed-marriage romances, including
“Madame Butterfly.” The atmosphere of a
lotus-eating languor is there, George Up-
ward’s scenery harmonises with the drowsy
musical accompaniments supplied by a little
crowd of Hawaiian natives, and nothing
disturbs the sensuous influence of the scenes
save a certain vulgarity of Yankee origin in
the action of the play.
* * * *
The moral lesson of the plot is purely and
emphatically American. A young New York
doctor comes to the heated island with a
high-minded girl for the alleged purpose of
finding a cure for leprosy. They strike a
drunken, brainy beachcomber (Frank
Harvey) and a native princess (Muriel
Starr)' who has the amorous temperament
of Carmen combined with the simple fidelity
of Madame Butterfly. The poor little doctor
(Louis Kimball) is a weak mortal. He looks
upon Muriel Starr in her attractive summer
garments, and is lost. Whilst the nice white
girl is inspiring the beachcomber to the high
and scientific life, Muriel reduces her curly-
haired doctor to degradation by marrying
him and mixing his drinks. Her love is his
undoing. After two years of lazy lawful
matrimony with the lady of inferior race,
Kimball is a pitiful spectacle of petulant in-
ebriety. whereas Harvey has earned a ten-
thousand-dollar testimonial from the Yankee
exploiters of Hawaii, and won the love of
the higkly-superior girl. Atholwood, as a
gloomy native priest, restores the luckless
princess to paganism in a measure, and she
is understood to jump into a blazing volcano
by way of appeasing the wrath of the vol-
canic god. Here endeth the moral lesson.
Muriel Starr has all the natural qualifi-
cations for the part of the hot Hawaiian
enchantress except an impossible loveliness ;
but her head of hair and her striking outfits
go far towards making her admirable in all
respects. Harvey, too, is happily placed as
the rather incredible waster who blossoms
into a choice example of true manliness.
Miss Tien Hogue, formerly of the Taits’ co.,
plays the nice, clean white girl with some
charm of blonde frigidity, and her brief love
scene with her convert is a sweet episode.
Kimball is not fully equal to the unthankful
job of falling into moral degradation under
the spell of a half-civilised donah. He puts
no detail into his manner of deteriorating,
nor expresses anything in particular except
lack of character and want of intellect. For
the rest, an impressive Atholwood in a state
of semi-nakedness ; George Bryant, as a loud
commercial Yankee disgusted by Kimball’s
weakness; Edwin Lester and Marion Clarke,
as a pair of wowser missionaries; Maggie
Moore and James Hughes, as well-meaning
pagans; and a number of Hawaiian natives
whose chanting and steel-stringed mandolins
are more artistically effective than the vol-
cano tableau which closes the unconventional
show.
“Dick Whittington,” the panto, at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, opens with a seeming
intention to tickle the interest of the young,
but resolves itself into a mainly-spectacular
entertainment for those of older growth.
The dressing is bright throughout, and some
of Coleman’s cloths are very persuasive
works of art. The youth and gaiety of a
large crowd of girls and girleens remain
with them through frequent changes of
costumes, so for ordinary Christmas busi-
ness purposes the J.C.W. panto, should do
very well. Yet it leaves no strong impres-
sions on one’s mind, evokes no shrieks of
laughter to speak of, and is void of new
mechanical tricks. The star specialty is an
item of violent gymnastics by a trio who
have appeared before, and the daintiest of
the musical turns is a duet by two interesting
kiddies, who are probably the pair grown
older that worked together last Christmas.
The voice of one of them, and the unaggres-
sive precocity of both, are a delight.
As for the version of the venerable Whit-
tington story, it is a poor hotchpotch, dis-
tinguished only by the fact that the Dame
and idle ’Prentice conspire to shake Aider-
man Fitzwarren’s till and cast their guilt
upon the massive hero who is our old Tivoli
friend Vera Pearce. Vera is sadly lacking
in frivolity and vim as the principal boy.
Her limbs and method are equally solid,
and her personality is merely picturesque.
Miss Pauline Bindley is an Alice whose value
is confined to her head notes, and neither
Pearl Ladd nor Constance Cayley scores a
distinct hit at any stage of the proceedings.
After the panto, proper has spun itself out,
there comes a short series of irrelevant scenes
where the comedians Stigant, Roxbury and
Fullbrook get their longest chances. Stigant
is always pretty good as the stereotyped
Dame, but none of the broad comedy scenes
are refreshingly humorous, and the scene
with beehives in it grows utterly wearisome.
After giving a passing word of praise to
Villiers Arnold for his demon vocalism, one
may say of the Whittington panto, that it
dances itself into favor. The Ballet of War—
wherein Maggie Dickinson, who is aaain a
slim young fay, Sydney Yates and a lissome
brunette are principal interpreters—is a
delightful dumb show. Likewise the Vogue
Ballet, with its studies in strange fashions,
and the Flying Ballet, which is full of legs
and evolutions. The grace and agility of
Young Australia have never been better dis-
played than in the Firm’s present Christmas
annual; but the appeal to small boys and
girls is very occasional. There is nothing
much for the infant mind to catch on to; a
clown with a red-hot poker, or a bottle-nosed
baron whose stummic-k played tunes when
punched, would be a useful addition to the
gentle gambols of Le Brun as the inevitable
cat.

J. and N. Tait belong to a school of humor-
ists that Australia can well do with. Not
below “Very Good Eddie” is their latest
catch, “The New Henrietta,” played in the
Palace (Sydney) on Saturday night. The
story might parallel that epic that will never
be written about Job the miserable and
Hughes the highly delighted, so wide and
diverse is the humor. A good cast, too.
Perhaps the best of the bunch is—well, let
there be peace. But see the show.

“The Red Widow” has only a few more
nights in which to throw superfluous bombs
nt a Czar who is no longer there. On Satur-
day Sydney Majesty’s will proclaim The
Bing Boys are Here.”
“Winnie Brooke, Widow,” the musical
play put on at Sydney Tivoli by Ada Reeve
ana co. as a Christmas attraction, is a crisp
novelty, and the electric Ada wires into it
and lights it up, lending extra candle-power
every now and then with a Reevian song.
The long cast includes Clarence Blakiston,
Talleur Andrews, Charles Albert and about
20 others who vrill be praised or blamed
next week when the most infernally-arranged
Christmas this paper has ever struggled with
has rushed over the horizon and broken its
neck on a pile of cheap imported toys.
Nieman and Kennedy, the tramp specialists,
and the Satinettos are headlining.
The major portion of the Christmas bill
at Melbourne Tilvoli is “Baby Mine,” which
was produced by J.C.W. at Sydney Criterion
two months ago, and proved but a poor little
effort at an all-night entertainment. In its
pruned and practised reappearance as a
vaudeville item, “Baby Mine” is more in the
fitness of things. The pretence of a plot
remains as thin as ever, but the incidental
larfs are broadened, and Beatrice Holloway
has developed her art of leaping into bed
until her agility almost excuses the hollow
cause thereof. There’s a superfluity of bed
and bedroom in this alleged comedy for
married people. The bed is a double one,
and three imitation infants, mere creatures
of celluloid, made for chucking about, are
associated with the commanding piece of
furniture. When they have been sufficiently
chucked about the story ceases, and the com-
pany lines up to receive the reward of its
labors. Beatrice Holloway and Bob Greig
(who never approaches the dignity of Rob-
ert) figure as leading voluntary workers. The
dolls have their labors thrust upon them.
For the rest of the bill four vaudeville turns
have been provided in the first part. Del-
more and Lee recite poetry of motion in an
aerial act, Rogero utters sweet sounds as a
Human Musical Box, and Reynolds and
White appear again. Until Saturday of next
week the hospitable doors of the Tivoli will
be opened twice daily, every afternoon a
matinee.

The age of miracles is not past. The film
magnate is actually turning into a human
being who remembers that he was once a
schoolboy ; so the picture specially designed
for the kid becomes more frequent. This
week Sydney Lyceum has a winner for its
matinees in “Robinson Crusoe” —a desert
island, Man Friday, thrilling adventures and
all. The problem of the birth-rate is being
added and subtracted by Alice Brady at the
Crystal Palace, and this time it is called
“God’s Greatest Gift.” At the Strand Fanny
Ward does her darnedest, but fails to throw
any light on several situations in “The Crys-
tal Gazer”; while Mrs. Vernon Castle has
two-stepoed to the Lyric, where she and her
young man go through their impossible
“Stranded in Aroady.”

Hoyt’s Melbourne house promises some
rare programmes for 1918. The firm has
secured the sole Australian rights for the
Famous Players-Lasky, Arbuckle and Max
Sennett films, and will control a constellation
including Mary Pickford, Pauline Frederick,
Douglas Fairbanks and other celebrities. The
first of these features, a version of “Broad-
way Jones,” with the original Jones (Geo.
M. Cohan) in the r6le, will be screened on
Saturday.

Irene Vernon Castle is again the main
suit at Melbourne Britannia this week in
a further helping of the “Patria” serial.
Margery Wilson is another strong feature
on the" same screen in the illicit whisky
romance called “Mountain Dew.” The
week’s offerings at the Melba are Henry
Morey in “Richard the Brazen” and Virginia
Pearson in “A War Bride’s Secret.” Tne
latter can be recommended as a strong war
yarn that will hit the pacifist intellect
under the belt. Moreover, Virginia is great
in the leading rQle. She fills the eye with
her sumptuous charms.
Roasting weather in Adelaide has been all
in favor of outdoor shows, the Pierrots at
the Exhibition, the .Testers at Austral Gar-
dens. Nothing really great about either,
perhaps, yet good all round, and frivolous
enough for a hot night. Wondergraph
scores, too. in having an open-air pitch;
George Cohan is the star of the moment,
just as William S. Hart the tragic and
Chaplin the farcical run the show at West’s.
The Pav., however, still relies on feminine
attraction, with a Saunders lady who calls
herself “Jackie.” At the Royal, Fox films,
with the reliable Stuart Holmes; at the
Tivoli, still more melodrama; at the Majes-
tic, the immensely popular Denny and Duni-
gan, and soldier Copeland, whose thought-
reading turn is novel in that the “wizardry”
is done by a very small boy.

Beauty is King.
IjADIES! As culture begets taste, taste begets
beauty; even as music soothes the soul, so beauty
soothes the heart. It is true, all good things come
to an end, but you can delay that end from coming
too soon. Flowers even will fade without nourish-
ment and care. Heaven helps them who help them-
selves. The great war has made you the greatest
factor on earth, but, with the wastage of manhood,
in the struggle to come it will be the survival of the
fittest. Nature in her wonderful way has determined
that all life must display its beauty to the opposite
sex to gain approbation, and to each she has allotted
its own particular charm. Beauty is only skin deep,
and it is exposure to wind and weather principally that
prevents face from being as perfect as the rest
of your body. Your skin needs care and nourishment
to keep pace with the wastage caused from exposure.
In modern skin hygiene the aim is to cleanse and
improve the texture of the skin and develop and bring
back its latent beauty rather than gloss over imper-
fections. JOHN STRANGE W INTER 5s TOILET
PREPARATIONS have been scientifically prepared for
this very purpose. They offer the modern creams,
which are a supreme aid in making women more
comelj. more attractive and more charming. Use
them daily after shopping, motoring or a busy day
at home, to remove dirt from the pores and freshen
up the skin. You need only rub it in and rub it
out again to rejuvenate your skin and bring healthy
glow to your cheeks. Dry, tender and chapped skins
are soothed and softened by their use. They are so
dewy, so delicate. Even if not beautiful, you can
at least be comely. If you can make your skin more
attractive, why not do so? After all, the best judges
of toilet preparations are those who use them, and
when you know J.S.W. preparations are used by
royalty and bare gained six gold medals at London,
Paris and Rome, it is a sufficient guarantee for you.
Moreover, more women are using them every year,
because of their genuineness and purity, because
they would not harm the skin of the tenderest babe,
because of their softness, transparency, pleasing odor
and adherent qualities. If you wish to look your
best, to be comely, you must give attention to those
little arts wnich no woman can afford to despise.

A considerable fuss has been made over
General Allenby’s modest entry by foot into
holy Jerusalem. The correspondents on
the rocky spot represent that the ceremony
was arranged that way to stress the fact that
the Holy City hadn’t been “captured,” but
was merely being “occupied.” But this
paper, knowing the ruinous Turk, and hav-
ing inspected Jerusalem, guesses that Allenby
left his horse at home that morning because
the street is so narrow that even a Palestine
ass has to hold its breath while passing
through the narrower places. And presently
the street becomes an interminable flight of
steps. No British general with a regard for
his dignity w T ould attempt to ride a horse
up a ladder.

“138”: This is the record of an Australian
boy who wanted to go with his big brothers.
While still short of 16 he boarded an out-
going transport for Egypt. The matter of
a uniform was easy, and the kid landed
successfully and lived in various camps
around the desert (Zietoun and Tel-el-Kebir)
until the boys moved to France. Again he
managed to beat the embarkation people, and
got mixed up with some ironmongery at
Pozieres. Evacuated to England carrying
some of it with him, he was presently
granted 14 days’ “wounded furlough.' He
reported to a command depot to time, but
decided that Scotland was worth a visit.
There he was picked up by the military
police for being absent without leave and
was returned to his depot. Giving his cor-
rect name to the authorities and the umtieth
battalion as his unit, he puzzled Horseferry-
road for a time, until he explained that he
had never attested, that he wasn’t entitled
to wear the uniform according to K.R.R„
and had served for two years with the A.I.F.
without ever receiving pay ! Asked how on
earth he managed, he replied that he had
plenty of good cobbers who knew his history
and supplied him with coin. Now the heads
at A.H.Q. are scratching their ears and won-
dering what they are to do with Billjim s
Little Brother. What couldn’t you do with
a nation of him !
“Country Ped” : The record of some of the
little Yic. State schools up this way—l’m ou
the fringe of the Mallee —makes me feel very
mean when I’m not feeling very proud. Wlo t
do you think of little Cannum South, with
an average attendance of 19, which has sent
£7O to the Patriotic Fund during the last
year? Eighteen of our 19 betters belong to
the Young Workers’ Guild, whose members
have to earn their money. Fourteen have
earned £1 apiece. And there’s Nypo, with an
average attendance of less than 30. Every
child there is a member of the Young
Workers’ Guild. Twenty have earned £1
each, five have each earned £5 —chiefly by
farm work during holidays—and one £lO.
In addition the girls have knitted 186 pairs
of socks (one girl alone knitted 50 pairs) and
90 scarves, and they’ve all sent their love
to Bill, and told him about Rankine's crop
and the other things that it’s good to keep
Bill interested in, in dozens of letters.

A Sydney reporter timed three short-
measure cases lately, and it makes brisk
reading. A wood and coal juggler was fixed
and fined in 2min. 29sec.; a fruit barrowman
who tried some sleight-of-hand got his lot in
2min. 31sec.; and a banana merchant who
tried to shove off a customer with only 14
fruit-sausages for 6d. when the banana-
drunkard expected to be loaded with 24. was
peeled by the Law in 4min. 12sec. But they
ere all retail frauds. It takes years and
years and years for the Law to even make
up its mind to prosecute a wholesale brigand.
In Melbourne the other day three or four

substance that was barely on nodding terms
with wool. One miscreant produced his in-
voices, and showed that the stuff had been
sold to him as flannel. The P.M.. who should
have know better, asked why the wholesaler
wasn’t prosecuted. The uniformed Law re-
plied that it didn’t know—it had never seen
a wholesaler’s invoice before. How could it
be expected to —the practice of selling this
stuff as flannel had been in existence for pro-
bably no more than 20 years, one witness
swore! A barrow may be disposed of in
2min. Slsee.. but it takes a lot longer to put
through a Rolls Royce.

“Jobber": Will you please ask Senator
Pearce what he is going to do about this?
On many occasions—l blush to have to tell
you—l’ve seen Australian soldiers marched
through the streets of Cairo. London
and provincial towns in England by the
Military Police, handcuffed! Their “crime”
is invariably A.W.L. (absent without leave),
and I, with many others, declare that such
a thing is an insult to our uniform and our
country, not to mention our men. Isn’t
there something in King’s Regulations about
putting a prisoner in a conveyance where
one is to be had, and there are one or two in
London, at any rate. Incidentally, why not cut
out the hideous word “crime” and substitute
“offence”? If a man is a few minutes late,
lie’s “crimed.” I’m not weeping for Billjim.
But I am anxious about the effect these silly
anachronisms, these senseless old military
customs, these t autocratic practices of the
military caste, are going to have on Aus-
tralia. You observe that, whereas universal
military service was once accepted by prac-
tically everybody in the Commonwealth, there
are now tens of thousands of conscientious
opponents of it even among the troops. I
have talked with hundreds of men in Egypt,
Palestine, England and France and have lis-
tened to the talk of thousands more, and I
declare that indignities which Billjim knows
to be totally unnecessary are almost wholly
responsible for the change of feeling.

“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Pfahlert’s corner
pub, historic amongst the beer-pumps of
Sydney, is on the market. The site is a
part of the old Military Barracks Square,
cut up and sold in the first fifties of last
century. In the middle of the decade the
house was built and occupied as a German
club, the southern part of the ground being
a garden where the Teuton swilled his lager.
The secretary of the club was Simon Zollner,
who was in the galvanised-iron business. In
the first ’sixties Abraham Cohen, father of
the late Justice Cohen, took the property over,
opened it as a hotel and kept it for many
years; and one sign or another has been over
the door ever since. In these latter days
the shingle bears the name of a man who
probably never personally sold a pot in his
life —Andrew Black, the professional singer.
He married the landlady.

“Kharn” (from Palestine) : Don’t know
why, but I’m annoyed about this. Out of
S 9 awards for bravery handed out by the
Royal Humane Society of Australasia in
July last no less than 18 go to Sale in Vic-
toria, or 20 per cent. Further, I find
that 33 per cent, go to Gippsland.
And, finally, of the SU awards, no less
than 73 go to Victoria, the remain-
ing 16 being divided up between Banana-
land. X. S. Wales, Tassy. S.A. and West-
ralia. not forgetting Canberra and the
Northern Territory. Do the all-powerful
“directors” who make the awards live in
Sale or somewhere else in Gippsland? And
why not cut the “Australasia” out of the title
and make it the Royal Humane Society of
Victoria? Incidentally, if it were not for
the Censor I would tell you how some offi-
cers get decorations for scraps they only
hear about afterwards. I might even tell
you of the answer which the colonel of a
resting regiment gave to a communication
from up above asking him to nominate four
men for a French decoration.

There are hundreds of teachers of both sexes employed in
the N.S.W. Educational Service to-day who suffer from weak
nerves or acute nervousness, through continuous nerve strain in
teaching and study, who never really enjoy good health. It is
as much the worry of keeping their schools up to the educa-
tional standard as the work which accounts for their feeling of
general ill-health. They should keep Clements Tonic on hand
as a “stand-by” medicine, feeling certain that in its possession
they will have a sweet soother of the nerves, a promoter of
keen appetite, and a general healer of the rundown and over-
wrought system. It makes weak people well and strong people
stronger. Get it to-day.
“Caboolture” : There is still in existence a
plan of Brisbane made in 1539 by
Major Burney, C.E.; this was three
years before the settlement was thrown
open to free persons. The prisoners’ bar-
racks were located about where Spencer’s
picture-show now stands. The “lumber yard,”
or prison workshop, was on the block
where West’s pictures are. The old
“Female Factory” was located on the site
of the present post office; but the female

“Poor Percy! He seems terribly upset over
his wife divorcing him. I didn't think
he was so attached to her.”
"Oh, it's not that. He’s just found out that
divorcees are to be classed as single
men."
convicts had been removed to Eagle Farm a
few years before, and the buildings w r ere used
as a residence by that fine man, Andrew
Petrie, Superintendent of Works for the
settlement, for a year or so after his arrival
from Sydney in 1837. A house was after-
wards built for him almost on the corner of
the present Wharf and Queen streets, whence
arose the name Petrie’s Bight. Creek-street
was a real creek in those days, and the pre-
sent horse-ferry lands just about the place
where there was a large fish-trap built across
the creek-mouth. The Petries’ garden ex-
tended from Creek-street to the river bank
at the rear of Thomas Brown and Co. s
warehouse, and the blacks used to swim
across from Kangaroo Point and loot the
sweet potatoes. An aged convict gardener
attended to them with a horse-pistol full
of pebbles whenever he got a chance. The
hospitals for officers, soldiers and convicts
were on the site of the Law Courts, and the
soldiers’ barracks stood where the Treasury
is now. One of the first cemeteries was just
opposite to the coal shoots at the Roma-street
’ station. The hills overlooking Roma-street
(now being cut away for the new goods
yards) were the favorite site for corroborees
and camping grounds. Another was at the
Exhibition Grounds. The scrubs about Too-
wong Railway Station and West End were
great hunting grounds for the aborigines.
The present Government Store buildings date
back to the convict days, except for a new
floor added recently. The Present Obser-
vatorv was the original windmill built tc
grind the maize meal on which the prisoners
were mostly fed. The first execution by
hanging in Brisbane took place here in the
’forties. The leading parts were played by two
aboriginals who had murdered the surveyors
Stapylton and Tuck.
The Union Jack has been flying over the
benches all right; but that kind of thing has
its limits, and the other day the High Court
simply couldn’t see how it could go as tar
as it was invited to. A Russian ship came
to Australia and wanted to get a clearance
for S. America, being under charter to carry
nitrates. The Commonwealth Government
snapped its fingers at charters and told the
Russian that he couldn’t get a clearance
unless he loaded wheat. So, while others
were making big money, he was hung up
here; and now he naturally wants com-
pensation. In effect the point for the High
Court was whether, Billy Hughes being the
Crowrn, Billy could do any wrong:—
The requirement of the Commonwealth was that
aliens should themselves engage in the service of
the Commonwealth as well as permit their property
to be used. To some extent, this appeared to be
recognised as permissible. But in the authorities
to which they had been referred there was not any
statement showing that the mere fact of war sup-
ported an attempt to compel aliens to personally
enter the King’s service outside the territory and
on the open sea, and while there to risk capture or
death at the hands of the enemy.
So the Court blasphemously decided that
Billy may do wrong, and that the Common-
wealth is liable to pay heavy damages for
unlawful acts that he may commit in its
name.
“Tweed Heads”: When my old friend
Bethstreet was finding his feet in the city,
years ago, he started to refurnish his
mother’s house, which had lost a good deal
of furniture in the storms. He was a proud
lad when he had finished buying a good Ger-
man piano on time-payment—a matter of
five years or so. Then, when he had put
the home people on their feet, he must needs
get married and buy a second good German
piano on time-payment. His wife used to
play all the British patriotic airs on it. I
remembered Bethstreet, the patriot, yester-
day when I read of the tremendous prepara-
tions Germany is making for the aerial war
in 191 S. Some 29 new airplane factories
have been started, and the Fokker people
have taken over the German works whence
came Bethstreet’s two musical boxes. It
seems that the plants of piano factories can
quickly be altered to make aircraft. Beth-
street is now at the Front waiting for some
flying Hun to bomb him. In his saner
moments he says he deserves it.

Baird, Vic. Minister for Education, has
made an early start in his new job by
doing the right thing for his constituents,
besides helping the rising generation to re-
member him in its prayers. This haying
season the State schools are to close up for
six weeks instead of five —to reward Little
Willie and Annie for having raised nearly
a quarter-million patriotic sovs.: giving them
back, in short, some of their own time, so
much of which has been spent, before and
after school hours, in pursuing the adult popu-
lation with things to sell, or in making
things and growing things to help the sol-
diers’ funds. The results are all the more
notable because director Tate frowns
severely on raffles. The money lias nearly
all been raised by direct collections, enter-
tainments or the giving of value for value.
Now, while Minister Baird is feeling benign
towards Willie, he might perhaps be pre-
vailed on to go round a few of the schools
and look at the ventilation.
“A.G.”: Yesterday Old Ted, our hard-
doer, manufactured some excitement for the
battalion, which was yawning in reserve.
A week or two back
he met two good
chaps down at the
estaminet. They
were observers
from a church
steeple close to the
line. Dougan paid
them a visit by in-
vitation next day,
and the Tommies
drank his health.
Dougan, a bit mud-
dled, climbed the
steeple to have a
peep at Fritz, when
the observation-offi-
cer came up unex-
pectedly, whipped
out his revolver,
and looked like
pulling the trigger,
when Ted fell
through the nearest
exist and slid down
the bell-rope. Away
went the old bell
clan g—c 1 a ng—
clang, after a
silence of nearly
three years. The
startled battalion
sprang to arms and
stood to until
Dougan slunk back
and gave the boil-
ing adjutant a con-
fused account of
the accident. Old
Ted is now killing time at pack-drill or
something.

“D.S.” : If the Victorian train that wan-
ders up the hill from Tallangatta to Shelly
does not hold the Australasian record for
want of speed it should. The time-table
gives it three hours to get past 23 miles, and
it usually takes a little extra. But it has
the excuse that Shelly is the highest railway
station in Vic., 2560 ft. above sea-level, and
that in the 23 miles the line climbs nearly
2000 ft.

“Sacred visions,” frequently seen in the
night skies during the siege of Przemysl by
the Russians in 1915, had a considerable
effect in bucking up the defending Austrians
and disgruntling the Russian artillerymen.
The explanation really reflects credit on the
ingenuity of our friends the enemy. The
visions appeared only on cloudy nights, and
in those latitudes rain-clouds travel at an
altitude of about half a mile. By using a

searchlight with a special mirror and a
stereopticon, it is quite practicable to pro-
ject fixed pictures to a distance of 1000 feet,
with full illumination. A generator of suffi-
cient power, run off an aeroplane engine,
would weigh less than 10001 b., which is quite
an easy load for a large biplane. The Aus-
trians had aeroplanes fitted with the neces-
sary apparatus, and prepared slides from
the celebrated picture of the Madonna and
Child at the Czenostochowa monastery, which
was in their hands at the time. This picture
is said to have been painted by St. Luke, and
has a wide reputation in Eastern Europe.
The airmen were then sent to fly at from 700
to 1000 feet below the clouds, turning on the
apparatus as required. At 1000 feet the
image of an ordinary lantern slide would be
magnified to 185 feet in diameter. Some
Russian soldiers refused to fire for hours
after each release of this decidedly striking
feature, and a Russian artillery commander
who suspected the trick and ordered, a bat-
tery to blaze away at the “vision” had a
narrow escape of being scuppered by his
scared men.

A letter written by Edmund Fisher to an
old Anglo-Australian friend who is doing
good war work in England seems to have
had influential circulation. Fisher’s corres-
pondent writes (23/10/T7) :
Every word of your letter is God’s truth. I
showed it to , who at once asked me to supply
him with a copy that he might place it before the
War Cabinet. I saw him hurriedly yesterday morn-
ing. He was just able to tell me that it had been
before the Cabinet and Lloyd George.
Meanwhile Edmund Fisher has only a vague
recollection of what he wrote. But The
Bulletin knows. Fifty-two times a year
Fisher wants The Bulletin to assert that
Britain’s war efforts are discounted,
thwarted, hampered at every turn by Ger-
man and Germanised interests in high politi-
cal, financial and social circles; that English
unsuspiciousness is a great national peril;
that the winning of the war from the air,
where alone it can be won for the Allies, is
being delayed almost beyond possibility of
salvation by the jealousy of the military and
naval bosses; that the contented drone of
unreasoning optimists is lulling the nation to
sleep whilst profiteers are plundering its
pockets. All this, and more, is what this
paper’s old-established Melbourne philoso-
pher is certain to have said in the letter
which was placed before Lloyd George and
the War Council, and was probably dis-
missed as being too unpleasant for words.
OYER THE FENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I always played with little girls,
With smooth pigtails or tidy curls,
lu lacey frills, and laundered frocks,
And shiny shoes, and faultless socks.
But while we learned the smiling code,
Wild laughter reached us from the road ;
And, oh, I longed with every sense
To join the rebels o’er the fence!
Grown up, I still am hemmed about
By friends impeccable who flout
No social law, who smoothly talk,
And use Life’s proper knife and fork.
But when I can I slyly creep
And at the outside revels peep.
Oh, someday will I have the sense
To climb across the silly fence?

Agar Wynne is lending a hand with the
Edward Lascelles memorial, which is to take
the sensible form of a new textile college in
Victoria. But after the college—what then?
Jobs will have to be found for the experts
whom the new concern will turn loose, and
where is the adequate tariff to guarantee
them scope for their energies?
There have been nine Presidents of the
N. S. Wales Leg. Council. Three of these
aave either not been offered knight-
hood or declined it —Plunkett, Wentworth
and Flowers. The first four resigned
office —Stephen. Plunkett, Burton and
Wentworth. The next four died in
office. The ninth man has held the job some
months short of three years. There have
hitherto been seven Chairmen of Committees.
All are dead. The eighth, Barnabas O’Conor,
son of an Anglican parson, has been in office
54 years. Among Speakers, numbering 14,
Abbott had the Chair for close on 10 years.
McCourt for 10 years and five months. The
shortest term was Morton’s, less than four
months.
In a Melbourne suburb the other day two
Misses Long, sisters, were married to two
Briefs, brothers. Now we shan’t be Long.
Only one of the leading barristers
engaged in the protracted Tichborne trial
now survives, and he recently started his
93rd year. He is Lord Halsbury, ex-Lord
Chancellor. As Sir Hardinge Gifford he
pocketed some thousands of pounds for his
strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to make
the jury believe that the Wagga butcher
was the long missing English Baronet.
“Vic”: It is now beyond doubt that Mel-
bourne’s most prominent magistrate, S.
Goldsmith, P.M., was drowned off the little
bay steamer Planet during the ferry trip
from Williamstown. A better beak never
sat by the Yarra. He was well known for
years as police-court clerk; then he quali-
fied for city magistracy by service in vari-
ous minor places. With higher training he
would have been a first-rate judge.
Joe Carruthers’s elder brother J. E., Pre-
sident of the Australian Methody church,
will be 70 next month—his anniversary
comes with that of N. S. Wales. Ex-Pre-
mier Joe is the youngest of four brothers,
and he is 61. The eldest, Henry, was
accountant of N. S. Wales Railways: J.E.
came next; and the third has been mayor
and most other things at Kogarah (N.S.W.).
PETHEBRIDGE, formerly Secretary to the
Australian Defence Department, now
Administrator at Rabaul.
“T. 0.1.”: Though ex-Justice Mathew
Henry Stephen (B. 13/12/T7) was the first
Australian-trained lawyer admitted to our
Bar, he was not the first Australian ad-
mitted. That honor belongs to William
Charles Wentworth, who was called in Lon-
don in 1822 and admitted in Sydney in 1824
—the first barrister in practice in Australia.
Here’s a remarkable family history. Of
the children of that daughter of pioneer
parson Marsden who in 1822 married
Thomas Hassail, the first rector of Cob-
bitty (N.S.W.), no less than three are still
living. Thomas Hassail was born in Cov-
entry, England, and accompanied his mis-
sionary to Tahiti in the ship Duff.
He was one of a family of eight, six of
whom were born in Australia. When a lad
Tom went to England to study for the
Church. It was a 10-months’ vovage; he
returned fully ordained in 1821. 'with an
appointment as Colonial Chaplain and assist-
ant to Marsden. In 1522 he married Sam-
uel’s daughter. This lady, who died at 92.
may be considered an Australian, as she
was born just outside Sydney Heads on
board the ship which brought parson
Marsden and his bride to Port Jackson.
Their three children who still survive are
Mrs. Hope, of Melbourne. 90; Charles
Hassail. of Victoria. So; and Miss Eliza
Hassail (N.S.W.), 82.
After 57 years of peace George Williams
of Tallangatta (Vic.), thought that it was
up to him to enlist, because he reckoned that
his two boys wanted someone to look after
them. He persuaded the recruiting officials
that he was 44. and fought as well as plenty

• From the other end of the earth :
Rear-Admiral Sims, who commands Uncle Sam's
naval forces in Europe, met his old friend ex-
Admiral Percy Scott in England lately. The two
were comrades in China in the ’nineties. Both were
mad on gunnery and were almost insubordinate in
their efforts to improve the shooting of their fleets.
Sims conveyed his enthusiasm to Washington in an
unsolicited report criticising the conservatism of the
High Command, and was very nearly sacked. Scott
showed the same spirit a few years later when con-
trolling a squadron of a fleet commanded bv Lord
Charles Beresford. To the old Irishman Scott's
mania for efficiency was incompatible with the be-
haviah of an officah and a gentleman; so Beresford
was not so shocked when his subordinate translated
an order to “Paint Ship” into “Make Yourselves
Look Pretty,” and flung- out the jeer from his own
signal halliards. The Morris tube that revolution-
ised target work was invented by Scott in China
on the alleged initiative of Sims, who had always
regretted that effective practice was barred by the
cost of ammunition. Sims introduced the Morris
tube to the U.S. Navy and caused a momentous in-
crease in the record of hits. Sims is also responsible
for the lattice masts in Yankee Dreadnoughts, which
are alleged to be superior to the British tripod
variety, and for other innovations—including the
fracture of the hallowed Yankee system of promotion
by seniority. Like General Pershing, who beat
over 800 seniors in his jump for promotion, he is
the junior in service to several officers who are his
inferiors in rank. He is a Canadian, by the way,
born in Ontario in 1858.
Parson Blacket, the qid chronicler of S.
Aus., is struggling to get Kangaroo Island
given its full historical value. The island
was, like Maoriland, inhabited by sealers
before any Government came along. One
of them had such strength of character (or
of body) that he got the name of “Governor”
Whalley, and Blacket wants his hut identi-
fied and labelled.
Mazzini Tron, chaplain, who won the M.C.
in Flanders lately, is an Anglican priest
who before the war belonged to the Brother-
hood of St. Boniface in the diocese of Bun-
bury (W.A.). Bigjohn Forrest is generally
regarded as the patron saint of Bunbury;
but when the place became an Anglican see
in 1902, Dr. Goldsmith, who wore the first
gaiters, discovered that the English Bunbury,
after which the W.A. seaport is named, is
really Boniface-bury, or Boniface’s town,
and the local Anglicans adopted St. Boni-
face as their patron, and have kept his
“day”—June s—as5 —as their festival ever since.
Boniface, by the way, was an English monk
who died about 1200 years ago. He is
reckoned “the apostle of Germany” and the
father of German Christianity; but this
paper doesn't know what he thinks of his
offspring.
“Trooper Bluegum” ; Another good Aus-
tralian gone—Lieut. H. E. Bowd, white man.
He left Sydney with the Light Horse, and
last year transferred to the Flying Corps.
For several months he scouted over Abdul’s
lines. On his last day he was up 4000 feet,
when something went wrong, and the ’bus,
in flames, dived to earth. A couple of hun-
dred feet from the ground Bowd jumped or
was thrown out, and was probably suffocated
before he landed. His pal. Lieut. C. E.
Stones, who left the Light Horse with him,
went into the Valley some little time ago.
Captain Harry Storrer, who has been
killed in France, gave up a motor-expert’s
job at Dennys Lascelles’ when he enlisted.
He left Australia with the A.F.C., and as
a qualified flier had gained some local pres-
tige before he embarked for the Front. A
brother, Murray, went West during the Gal-
lipoli campaign.
Of Portuguese extraction, Tom Bak Hap
obtained his Oriental moniker and a know-
ledge of Chinese from his stepfather. Before
being elected as member for Bass in 1909 he
made a crust as a mining and commission
agent, whilst an occasional trip to the “Far
East” would generally return its share of
oats. He got the electors to transfer him to
a job as Senator in 1913, and when war
started 12
months later he
went all in for
O o n s c ription,

‘*Y\ aiwera’s” yarns of a crimson character:
Nicholas Minister (B. 6/12/’l7) was, and is, best
known in the Straits as Nicholas the Greek, and the
tales about him and his doings aie innumerable.
Once a warship made a call in the Trobriands for
the special purpose of interviewing Nicholas with
reference to one of his little difficulties with the
natives. Navigating cautiously amongst the un-
charted reefs, the vessel came on a European fishing
in a canoe, and asked the way to the abode of that
turbulent descendant of Leonidas whom they sought.
The European very obligingly acted as pilot, and after
a hair-raising passage through a series of hairpin
channels, brought them without mishap to the de-
sired address. Nicholas was found to be out, and
after acting as interpreter to ascertain this fact
from the local natives, the obliging stranger took
them safely out again and promised to do what
he could to secure Nicholas’s attendance on some
future occasion. It was not till quite a long while
afterwards that the captain of the war vessel learned
that the obliging stranger who had performed the
miracle of navigation was Nicholas himself. What
could a navigator do to a pastmaster like that?
One thing H.M. Navy knew' it couldn't do, and that
was follow him.

My life is jist a whitewashed blank,
With flamin' spurts of pain.

Or caught out in the rain
When skies were peltin’ fish-plates, bricks ’n'
lengths of bullock-chain.

’N’ hatin’ of the bloke
Who’s in the doss right next to mine
With ’arf his girders broke.
He never done no ’arm to me,

But I have got him snouted, see,

Comes with the chemist’s swill,

She ain't a beaut, she’s thirty-two,
She scales eleven stone;
But, 'struth, I didn’t think it true
There was such women grown!
She's nurse ’n’ sister, mum. ’n’ dad,
’X’ all that's straight ’n’ fine
In every girl I ever had.
When Gabr’el comes, ’n’ all the glad,
Young saints are tipped the sign,
You’ll see this donah take her place, first angel
in the line!
I dunno if she ever sleeps
Ten minutes at a stretch.
A dozen times a night she creeps
To soothe a screamin’ wretch
Who has a tiger-headed Hun
A-gnawin’ at his chest.
’X’ when the long, ’ard fight is won,
’X’ he is still ’n’ nearly done,
She smiles down on his rest,
’X’ minds me of a mother with a baby at her
breast—
The curly kid we cuddled when
There was no splendid row:
It seemed a little matter then,
But feels so wondrous now.
It’s part of her. She’s Jenny Dark,
Flo Xightingale, all fair
’X’ dinkum women since the ark.
If she comes in without a “spark”
We blighters feel her there.
The whole pack perks up like a bird, ’n’ sorter
takes the air.
She chat sv on in a ’lghland botch ;
But if our Sis saw fit
To pitch Hindoo instead of Scotch
I'd get the hang of it,
Because her heart it is that talks
What now is plain to me.
At war where bloody murder stalks,
’X’ Hell its foulest samples hawks,
I have been given to see
What simple human kindness is, what brother-
hood may be.

bene er I think of you, my fighting son,
You draw quite near to me.
ou speak, you more, as you have always done,
Through my quick memory.
You are myself—bone of my bones; all me.
Sometimes I seem to leap
Red o’er your parapets of misery,
While you lie here asleep.
I ha\e known pain and patience both for vou.
Rough torments I have slain—
Moulded you, manned you. made you bold and true,
yielded you heart and brain.
Tou were my babe, my all, my fighting son,
Taking full life from me.
Still, still you draw it, and our two lives run
In perfect unity.
I fight with you. I charge the hot, dark hill.
I meet your pangs, your woes.
And I shall hold you, strong of heart and will,
Till our full triumph grows.
If you fall, I must fall—but not to death.
Oh, to eternity
Ton still are mine beyond the sobbing breath
The last pain draws from me.

Notwithstanding that there is an unfriendly
person at large whose present business is to
make things uncomfortable for British insur-
ance offices, the Colonial Mutual, with a little
help from Jellicoe, has managed to look after
itself very well; and the loss rate is actually
less than usual. To some extent this is no
doubt due to the fact that property in Aus-
tralia is much too valuable to destroy just
at present. There is a thing known to under-
writers as the moral hazard, and it costs
them hundreds of thousands a year in times
when merchandise stock is hard to get rid of
and house and shop properties are difficult
to let. Ever since we have been scattering
borrowed war millions —scattering them at
a rate hitherto undreamt of —and ever since
the U-boats have given Australian industries
a Protection that no politician ever gave
them, the underwriter has been faii'ly easy
in his mind about his old enemy Moral
Hazard. Later on—but we simply don’t
know what is going to happen later on. If
somebody would tell us what price we shall
get for our wheat, wool, copper, lead and
other staples, and what we shall have to pay
for freights, we might make a guess at it.
The most hopeful feature, perhaps, is that
Britain is doing what we are scarcely
attempting to do, and paying so large a pro-
portion of her war bill out of current taxa-
tion. Actually one-seventh of Britain’s enor-
mous war expenditure has been thus far met
out of special war-time taxation. Leaving
out of the reckoning the loans made to the
Allies, a recent compilation, issued by
authority, shows that Britain is raising £1
by taxation for every £2 11s. 2d. spent on all
accounts. This, while it ought to make
Hughes and his Ministers blush, if they
have a blush about them, will make things
vastly easier for Britain after the war; and
therein lies our best hope that our markets
will not go to pieces.
The co. had a long struggle to get firmly
on its feet; and when it had got there it had
the good fortune to find that thousands of
people were beginning to think that if it was
good to encourage home industries it was
also good to encourage home insurances.
The results have been gilt-edged for this co.
Yet it can’t be said that the public has had
to pay any more for the local goods. If the
Colonial Mutual has made a lot of money it
can reply that it made it. by accepting the
rates fixed by an association in which the
foreign cos. are still predominant. Whether
this and other private offices will continue
to have quite as good a time as they have had
hitherto is a matter which the investor will
of course consider. During the last few
years, for instance, accident and workmen’s
compensation business has brought in good
revenue to Australian cos. One by one,
however, the State Governments have cut in.
The Queensland Government has not only
taken a monopoly of workmen’s insurance
in that State, but has started to take other
lines; and with the organisation which a
in one line furnishes, it must be a
powerful competitor. Victoria, though it
hasn’t taken a monopoly, has a workmen’s
compensation office, whose purpose is to give
cost-price insurance; and that sort of com-
petition is do good to a co. which is out to
make dividends. N. S. Wales has no Govern-
ment office; but the fear of it produced a
severe overhaul of rates in that State. Maori-
land has gone even further : it has a vigorous
fire office, as well as a workmen's compensa-
tion office : and though the fire office makes no
great progress, it unquestionably keeps others
in the field from getting fat. These and
various co-operative movements appear to be
reflected in this co.’s net premium income;
it will be seen that the total for the past
year was less than for any year since 1911:

The feature of that last line which hits you
hardest in the eye is the increase in the ex-
pense rate: general exes. —that is, salaries,
charges, stationery and advertising, exclusive
of brokerage and commission—ran last year
to £43,512, as against £40,111 for a larger
premium income in 1914; and taxation and
contributions to fire brigades are £3OOO more.
This is one of the other sort of consequences
of the war.
Owing to the rapid capitalisation of re-
serves, the 10 p.c. dividend takes a pretty
big bite out of the underwriting profit. In-
terest earnings provide only £19,252 of the
£30,000 dividend. Interest earnings, by the
way, are £2240 better than in the previous
year, which partly wipes out the higher exes.
The assets are nowadays a particularly
liquid lot: mortgages are only £12,000 and
freeholds £28,068. Add to present total funds
£135,000 to represent earnings for the cur-
rent year in excess of working exes., and the
total will give you an amount six times
greater than the average annual fire losses of
the past five years. When an Australian co. can
during any year meet losses six times greater'
than its average, and more than five times
greater than its worst experience, and can
do it without calling in a single mortgage,
there is no need to go exploring among omces
which send their profits away from Australia.

This little bank serves the north and west
of Tasmania, where it has its head-office and
15 branches; and, though its opportunities
have been restricted, it has managed to more
than double its reserves in 10 years while
paying a 7 p.c. dividend. Its balance-sheet
figures have jogged along in this unemotional
way

The comparatively big decline in “other
liabilities” is due to the retirement of bank-
notes on the arrival of Commonwealth paper.
Apart from the higher prices it hds got for
its wool, its copper and its tin, Tasmania
hasn’t benefited to any great extent from the
expenditure of war money ; nevertheless this
bank holds now £739,385 of the public’s
money as against £645.212 two or three
months after the war started. Of this debt
it has a reasonable 36 p.c. liquid (including
Commonwealth war loan) ; and the book-
value of the non-liquid assets is equal to 83s.
for every 20s. of the liabilities not repre-
sented by casli, etc. With less than £3 of
the public’s money in the business for every
£1 of its own, the bank can’t expect to make
big profits. On the other hand, the compara-
tively small proportion of the public’s money
P the business reduces the risks for ail
hands, shareholders and depositors alike.

This exceedingly affluent co. had a habit’of
making provision for risks that faded away
with the result that a few years ago. when a
solid million was added to the capital the
visible reserves were drawn upon for only
about a quarter of the amount. Latterly a
lot of revenue has been dropped into the
Insurance Fund ; and this has been reckoned
as profit in the foregoing table. Separating
these amounts from the net surplus as dis-
closed by F. and L. account, we get these
results: —
Net Profits. Added to Insurance Fund.
1915. . £136,383 £46,467
1916.. 150,174 158,696
1917.. 157,403 13,134
Possibly the co. carries some of its own in-
surance risks ; and it may be that the losses
have been exceptionally serious during the
past year. Theoretically, the proper course
would be to reserve the extra freight earn-
ings through war as a provision for (1) war
taxation and (2) war risks carried by the
co.; and maybe this is being done. In that
case the net earnings shown in the last little
table may be called the normal earnings.
There is, however, another semi-reserve
which isn’t included among the reserves in
either table. This was established in 1915
as a “reserve for liabilities not yet adjusted,
including provision for allowances on adjust-
ment of contracts, Imperial, Commonwealth
and Dominion taxes, and extra depreciation
on steamers in Government service.” In the
first year (1915) £209,227 was dropped into
this quasi-reserve, in the following year it
grew to £359,227, and now it is up to
£487,478. It is no doubt possible that these
contingent liabilities are steadily getting
bigger; but, generally speaking, when a
contingency fund keeps on growing, one
has a suspicion that the co. is having
better luck than it expected. Which
means that sooner or later more or
less is transferred to profits as being
no longer required to cover contingencies.
At any rate, one can say this: that, while
admitting a net profit of £157,403 for the
past year, this co., besides providing in the
ordinary way for depreciation, has set aside
about £140,000 which may or may not be
called for.
Comparing balance-sheet figures since the
co. was reconstructed, these results show up :

Liquid assets . . . . 736,702 741,397 1,430,030
So in three years the liabilities (apart from
the contingent liabilities before referred to)
have increased by £306,559, while liquid
assets have improved by £693,328; and,
though the fleet has been written down,
depreciation being thus provided for, its pi’e-
sent book value is nearly £400,000 greater
than it was three years ago. This paper
doesn’t suggest that the co.’s profits in excess
of the dividend have amounted to between
f 750 odd dnrl £BOO,OOO in three years ; but it
is a fact that the co. has put that much by
to provide for contingencies. In the circum-
stances, The Bulletin doesn’t see any
strong reason for sending managing-director
Iloldsworth a cable of condolence.

This was one of the humorous flotations of
the last company-promoting boom. The
goodwill, referred to above, was in respect
of two businesses carried on in Pitt-street.
One was in a leasehold which had only a few
months to run ; and as that business was un-
profitable no serious effort was made to renew
the lease. Business was then confined to the
other premises; and in a year or two word
went round that the lease there was just
about up, too. As a matter of fact, it expired
in September of this year, and the co. walked
out. Thus the businesses for whose goodwill
the co. had paid about half its capital evap-
orated. Meantime, however, the co. had got
hold of one or two little businesses run by
Miss Bishop: and Miss Bishop’s name being
evidently regarded as better than the one for
which the co. had paid so much, it is under
that sign that it now trades at a dozen
places in city and suburbs. Further:—
Regarding the writing down of the assets and
plant, and the general reconstruction foreshadowed
in last report, the directors have decided to submit
the necessary resolutions at a later meeting.
Presumably the old name will go. It was a
poor, inexpressive thing, anyhow, and w’hen
you look hungry and talk in Sydney aW
gcng to the A.8.C., most peopl/ utfS
stand that you are off to the corner ?f
George and King streets for a hank over-
draft. M ith the right management there is
a lot of money in this tea-and-scone business
Lp to now the management has no doubt
been handicapped by the businesses and leases
which it paid a lot of money for. but which
it probably should have been paid a bit m
take over. It has still, however, to nm
itself. Until then the investor will beslu
though to the speculator it will appeal as
something which may quite likely make an
excellent recovery.

This co., which paid a dividend at the rate
of 9 p.c. p.a. for the first half of its last year
pays at the rate of 12 p.c. p.a. for the second
half; and the distribution is on capital which
has been mostly transferred from reserves
The results are among the fruits of the bor-
rowing boom of the last seven or eight years
In 1910 the capital was £51,900, and the
reserves at the time were £64,514. Since
then £90,616 of profit has been capitalised
£292 has been paid in cash bonuses in lieu
of shares, and, after payment of a dividend
which is equal so far as the past year is con-
cerned _ to over 30 p.c. on the capital as it
stood in 1910, the reserves are £51,258 in
excess of what they were at that date. In
other words, besides paying the dividend, a
surplus profit has been made in seven years
of £142,166, equal to 2f times the capital as
it stood seven years ago. And there is no
doubt that if it wanted to the co. could show
more astonishing figures even than that, be-
cause the freeholds in hand have apparently
been written down severely. If you want to
know who benefits by a borrowing boom you
have only to ponder over these figures; for
a large part of this co.’s profits have been
made by buying estates, and subdividing them
for subsequent sale on time-payment.
At the present time, of its total assets of
£320,018, “borrowers’ and purchasers’ bal-
ances after deducting suspense accounts” re-
present £249,152, and the directors give share-
holders the very reassuring information that
over 80 p.c. of this is secured on rent-pro-
ducing properties.” The small balance repre-
sents balances on sales of land, and “ample
provision has been made for possible losses.”
The other assets are £27,677 liquid, £38,911
m freeholds (which presumably include the
co s valuable city premises, largely rent-
producing). and £4276 sundries. Including
provision for taxation the liabilities total
±36,107.
While circumstances have so richly favored
the co., the. management has been excellent;
and while it retains that asset the co. will
make money even in bad times. For the
immediate future it has its advances to rely
upon ; , and if there won’t be much in land-
subdivision for some years to come, there will
be good interest to be earned on high-class
securities. The co. needs to earn only 5 p.c.
net on its own funds, to pay its shareholders
8 p.c. on present capital. Losses it may pos-
sibly make; but its inner reserve will then
come in handy, and, unless the management
plunges, which it isn’t likely to do, the dead
weight of unproductive vacant land—which
has been so heavy a burden on many “in-
vestment cos. at the end of a boom —will
be almost negligible.

holders should receive some of the profits

o the co. 1 hey therefore recommend that
a bonus of o p.c amounting to £6500, should
be declaied. Well, Tiie Bulletin doesn’t
see any good reason why it shouldn’t be
clone, it is a bit rough, however, on former
shareholders who had to sell; to those who
did sell though they weren’t obliged to the
directors can at least say that, year after
jeai, they were at pains to point out that the
profit had actually been made. The policy
or trading so far beyond the capital of a co.
that no dividend at all can be paid for years,
all profits being required to reduce the over-
draft, is, nevertheless, open to grave ques-
tion.. The extent to which this co. launched
out is shown by the following statement of
its liabilities at various dates:—
Mar., 1912. . £46,796 Mar., 1915. . £103,787

The capital is £130,000: and, nominally,
reserves of about £29,000 were accumulated
in a recent 24 dry years. Nominally, because
the reserves include a depreciation fund.
The total of this is now £54,753 ; and as the
appropriation to it for the past half-year was
£2964, the P. and L. account claims a net
profit of only £6902 for the term. But this
reserve for depreciation is so very liberal
that it has always seemed doubtful to this
paper whether it should be struck out of the
reserves, as a depreciation reserve generally
should be. For these reasons; (1) repairs
and renewals are regularly charged up to
profit and loss; (2) apparently assets are
also written down occasionally—at any rate,
buildings, office furniture, plant and
machinery were in the balance-sheet at
£70,415 as at March, 1916, and 12 months
later the item had shrunk to £68,879, though
of course that may have been due to sales or
losses by fire covered by insurance; (3)
plant, etc., which has been kept in repair
and renewed, and which stands now at
£69,411. scarcely calls for a depreciation re-
serve of £54,753. Deducting this reserve,
the net assets are worth just upon 28s. per
share; including this reserve, 365. Stock
(£92,222) and advances on logs, etc.
(£35,808) together represent £128,030. which
looks a lot of money to have in building
material these times; but when you consider
that the sales last half-year were £131.100,
and for the past four half-years have aver-
aged £142,000, the figure seems a good deal
less incautious. Further, if building opera-
tions, etc., have slackened, the freight pro-
blem is so serious that timber prices seem in
no danger of an early slump—to say the least
of it.

Interest, rent and other income was £3859
last year, which is equal to an almost exact
5 p.c. on the assets. But as against
that there was a trifle of interest and
more than a trifle of land-tax and lates.
these two items, along with insurance and
repairs, bit out about £lBOO, leaving less
than £2OOO. After paying management exes.,
including income-tax. the balance was profit,
and it wouldn’t make anyone fat. During
the past three years the property account
has been reduced by £4749. Apparently
there has been no loss on the sales; but it,
on the other hand, there has been a profit. it
lias been put to an inner reserve —probably
used to write down the book-value of the
remnant. The non-liquid assets now consist
of —Property account £19,808. advances
£29,411. and land sales account £10.923; and
there is no good reason why the last two
shouldn’t be worth somewhere near their
book-value. The live capital is now £42,725
in 10s. shares, and £4582 is paid on forfeited
shares. The net assets (book-value) are
thus equal to about 15s. for each live share.
But the realisation has been very slow, and
it isn’t likely that circumstances will be as
favorable for some years to come. Prospects
being what they are, it would probably pay
the shareholders best to look for a buyer* of
the whole outfit in a lump.

Pref. capital is £3976 and ordinary capital
£18,937; but of the ordinaries £5OOO was
issued to A. 11. Ilasell for the goodwill of
his fertiliser business, and for the past
couple of years the vendor has handed the
dividend back to the co. to be applied to
the reduction of preliminary exes. The
refund is shown in the table as additional
profit. It is a very decent thing for the
vendor to do. Certainly he gets a bit other-
wise. Originally he had a contract with the
co. to act as selling agent at a remuneration
of 7s. 6d. per ton of super, and other ferti-
lisers sold; but this has been varied, and
he now receives p.c. on the gross sales
of these goods, which is apparently a gain
to the co. of about p.c. The co. relied
almost entirely upon foreign raw materials;
and the war has made it exceedingly diffi-
cult to procure them. Consequently the
turnover has been very much restricted. The
following shows the sales :
1913 .. £47,684 1916 .. £30,102
1914 . . 38,107 1917 . . 19,547
1915 . . 44,387
Expenses have, however, been cut down;
and that the co. has managed to pay a divi 1
dend in the circumstances is a creditable
performance. In consequence of the
reduced turnover the co. has £9692 of its
modest capital in cash, waiting for the clouds
to roll by. On the other side, certainly, it
has a mortgage of £4500. This was taken
against factory buildings, etc., which stand
at £6561.
The authorised capital of the co. is
£150,000, and some day it may be all wanted.
It ought to be if the co. is run upon a fair
co-operative basis, the dividend on the shares
being limited to, say, 7 or 8 p.c. The
farmers of N. S. Wales might save them-
selves tens of thousands of pounds a year if
they bought and sold co-operatively; and
there is a lot they might also do in the way
of co-operative manufacturing. It isn’t only
that they now provide profits for unneces-
sary middlemen: they support hundreds of
unnecessary travellers, and they. also pay
thousands of pounds more in freights than
they need if their supplies were sent over
the railways in bulk lots. This isn’t the
ideal co-operative co. There are vendor’s
shares, for one thing. But it was worth
paying something to get an organisation, and
there is no visible reason why this shouldn’t
be the nucleus of a concern of great value
to the primary producer; and upon his pros-
perity a great deal is going to depend during
the coming years. If we can make his lot
brighter and increase the number of pro-
ducers and the volume of produce we shall
find it a lot easier to pay our debts.

The mostly Sydney-owned Larut, one of
the most successful of the Malay dredging
cos., is putting some of its surplus cash
into two other concerns, the Kota and the
Tupai. For the property to be acquired by
the Kota, which is to have a capital of
£50,000, with £25,000 unissued and in re-
serve, the co. pays the vendor, Senator
Pratten, £25,000. Says the prospectus;—
The price fixed by the owner and vendor, Senator
Pratten, is £25,000, payable as to £5OOO in cash
and as to £20,000 in tully-paid shares. The cash
consideration represents approximately the outlay of
the vendor in acquiring and prospecting the property
and for reports obtained.
It is separated from the Larut only by a
road ; and somebody ought to explain why,
if Larut w*anted the ground, that co. didn’t
secure it at first hand instead of allowing
anyone to make a profit of £20,000 on the
deal. The area is about 226 acres. Appar-
ently it was previously bored for two Aus-
tralian interests —one of them the Austral
Malay—and turned down; but that, of
course, may have been because of the price
asked. Anyhow, the values seem to be very
erratic and, on the. whole, low. Under
Malcolm Newman’s direction 72 more bores
were put down, Assuming a good many
things, he reckons that there may be a profit
of from £25,000 to £40,000 for the first four
years and £14,000 to £20.000 for the next
54 years—the smaller figures on the basis
of tin (London) at £155; the higher on tin
(London) at £2OO. With a continuance of
the luck that those Malay cos. which have
got on to suitable ground have had, there
may be big profits in the block. But (1)
the ground has been very indifferently
tested; and (2) it will probably be two
years before a dredge can be on the ground,
and it is hard to say what tin will be worth
two years hence.
The Tupai is also to have a capital of
£50,000, with £25,000 in reserve; and in
this case also the owner and vendor is
Senator I’ratten, who takes £5OOO in cash
and £20,000 in shares, the former represent-
ing approximately the outlay of the vendor,
who is the chairman of the Larut Co., which
is the purchaser. Of this ground, which
is also in the neighborhood of the Larut,
Malcolm Newman says
The whole area has been repeatedly bored by
different cos., in particular by the Austral Malay
Co. In August, 1913, Mr. T. W. Horton put down 74
bores giving an average depth of 19ft. and an aver-
age value of .671 b. per cub. yard. About the middle
of 1915 the Austral Malay Co. rebored the area, and,
I believe, put down several hundred bores, but
did not complete its options. I have now put down
165 bores over an area of about 350 acres, the aver-
age value of the whole of these being .651 b. over an
average depth of 25ft. I have not bored the remain-
der of the field, which appears to be very shallow.
It seems, therefore, that Newman’s borings
agree with Horton’s. But Newman insists
that the property can be divided into two
parts, the payable, giving an average for
deep ground of .81b., and the unpayable,
shallow, worth less than He gives 80
acres containing over 44 million yards worth
lib. per yard, and 120 acres containing 5J
million yards worth §lb., and estimates pro-
fits, with tin at from £155 to £2OO London,
at £25,000 to £40,000 p.a. for the first four
years and £14,000 to £20,000 for the next
five.
The new cos. thus back Newman. If he
is right, and the market stands up to £155
for the next eight or 10 years, Larut will
have made two £mod deals, though its chair-
man does get £lO,OOO in cash and nearly
half the shares. Certainly, however, if the
cos. had been floated in the ordinary way,
the public, would have wanted an opinion
from a third party; for obviously there is
a direct conflict between two good “stables”
—one represented by Pratten and Newman;
the other by the Freemans and Horton. And
the public will have to remember this when
the scrip starts to move around.
Austral Malay Tin, Ltd., which has been
steadily turning down Malayan options, has
at last found something in which it thinks
it can smell dividends:—
The area is situated in Selangor, near Kuala Ivubu,
and is known as Ulu Kem. An area of 514 acres
particularly well suited for dredging has been proved
by 2'15 bores to average ,761 b. of tin oxide per cubic
yard, with an average depth of 22ft., and when all
titles have been put in order it is likely that this
area will be increased.
This 514 acres contains a total of 19,900,000
cubic yards, and the property, if equipped with a
dredge of similar c-apacitj' to those of the Kampong
Kamunting, should, with tin at £l7O per ton in
London, yield a divisible profit of £288,000, recover-
able in say 20 years, thus representing a return of
nearly 24 p.c. per annum upon a capital of £60,000.
To overcome the difficulty of getting a dredge
on to the property while the tin market is
still booming the Austral Malay is now woo-
ing Trong, which has a dredge and no suit-
able ground to use it in.
Some of the factors in the extraordinary
rise in the price of silver are disclosed by
the news that comes down slowly from Asia.
There have been half a dozen principal
causes: (1) An enormously increased con-
sumption in India, which is the world’s
largest consumer of the metal. The Hindoo
has never been persuaded to use paper-
money. He wants the metal. He can’t
always get it; but at pi’esent, when Europe
must have some of the things he produces
—jute, for instance —he can insist. He
doesn’t merely use it as circulation. He
hoards it; and a great deal, put into orna-
ments, is buried with him. Hence the con-
tinual demand for silver. In the 18 months
to the end of August India had absorbed
nearly 50,000.000 rupees (a rupee is worth
about Is. 4d.). (2) China has all along
been more or less preparing for war, and has
been accumulating silver for the purpose.
(3) Japan is having a prodigious trade
boom, which has meant a very big increase
in the demand for silver circulation.
(4) The U.S.A., though paying its troops
under trainihg in notes, is preparing to pay
them abroad very largely in silver, just as
Britain is doing. (5) The increase in
prices almost the world over, accompanied
by a general rise in wages, has called for a
world-wide increase in silver circulation.
(6) Meantime Mexico, which until five
years ago was one of the world’s largest
silver-producers—the second largest—is pro-
ducing very little, owing to domestic dis-
order. In all these circumstances an increase
in the price was inevitable ; and the mainten-
ance of high prices is almost certain for a
considerable time to come.
Mt. Morgan is extending its mill work.
In four weeks to December 9 it produced
8370 tons concentrates from 18,512 tons
crudes. The previous millings were 16,261
(Nov.), 14,032 (Oct.), 13,566 tons (Sept.).
During the latest run concentrates contained
441 tons copper and 36930 z. gold, averaging
5.2 p.c. copper, B.Bdwt. gold. With a smelter
so handy it doesn’t aim at a high-grade con-
centrate, but is satisfied if a large propor-
tion of nearly barren silica can be got rid
of in order to reduce the staggering smelting
costs.
Chairman Wharton talked to Hampden
shareholders about the resumption of divi-
dends. The mines worked through the sea-
men’s and waterside strikes ; but that meant
a large accumulation of stocks of blister, and
through shortage of coastal shipping the
copner is still there. However, the co. has
been pulling strings, and “it is possible we
may get forward the present accumulation
at Townsville during the next month or six
weeks, which means that we will be able to
refine same and deliver the refined copper to

MILLINERY
Sydney, December 24, 1917.
My Dear Arini. —
Admiralty House was alive with plumes
the other afternoon. Anything that can be
called a party in the pre-war sense is so
rare that the Investiture seemed a dazzling
event. Launches deposited those who also
climbed at the foot of the steep, terraced
gardens, and plain citizens panted up to
seize the vice-regal hand. This done, a
large and early-door audience, assembled on
the lawn, waited for the prisoner’s appear-
ance. Haskett Smith. A.D.C., turned up
first. Proceshing solemuly through the roped
enclosure, carrying a velvet cushion on
which glittered the K.C.31.G., he held the
sacred Thing till James Burns, guarded by
Dr. 3lackellar and William 3lc3lillan,
stepped forward to the garden throne. Here
he found his friend the G.-G., Lady Helen,
the Deputy-Gov. Cullens, and a retinue —
who so smart as General Finn in the long
blue service coat (and etceteras), now rarely
seen out of mothballs? After being severely
talked to in medieval language the new
knight rose up Sir James after a slap on the
shoulder with his Ex.’s sword. Dr. Evan
Jones, in an undertakery black suit, got the
Antarctic medal as the next item. And a
sad old father, the Rev. Howell Price, took
the military decoration awarded as a post-
humous honor to his brave son, the lieut.-col.
who was killed in France.
Then Society struggled out of its veils
and fell upon the refreshments. 3lodest
sailor Glossop helped to carve the cream-puff.
Clifford, A.D.C., loomed like a lighthouse
with a smile. Captain Dunn, R.A.N.. and
his blue-eyed lady, steered a course for a
shady patch, and near by the purple robes
of Archbishop Cattaneo floated in the stiff
nor’-easter. Archbish. Wright was in sombre
black, and the new young man at St. James's,
the ascetic 3licklem, was a clerical raven
alongside the lace frillies of 3loderator
Paterson. Captain d’Apice brought his
bride. 3lrs. Isaacs, the Judge’s wife who
has a Presence; 3lrs. Harry Finn and
daughter Kathleen in nut-brown filmy
drapery ; Colonel Lamrock and his wife';
the Misses Gother 3fann (early naval
history is their family forte) ; Consuls
galore; Alex. Hay and his pretty missus;
the King Salters from Cockatoo—in short,
all the tdfi-hats we haven’t seen for years
got an airing. An Investiture is a very
solemn thing, let me tell you.
Kelso King, who is crowned with a top-hat
oftener than anybody else in Sydney, ate his
way through a dinner given by the directors
and senior officers of the 3lercantile Mutual
Insurance Co. last week. The dapper insur-
ance sovereign, father of that Olive Kelso
King whose little picture I sent you the
other day, had been 40 years manager of the
office. And that hasn’t been his only worry.
For years and years he was the confidential
adviser of Walter Russell Hall; and—well,
the very rich old gentleman was difficult at
times, and nobody knew quite how to handle
him except his tactful young friend.
Brig.-General Antill. home on sick leave
after serving in Gallipoli and France, takes
a local job as Commandant of 3lenangle
camp, where they turn out the best Camel-
leros and Light Horsemen in the world.
G.-G. Ferguson addressed a seething mass
of youngsters and their mothers from the
official stand at the Christmas treat: to sol-
diers’ kiddies. Dr. 3lary Booth. 3lrs. Ted
Antill. the C. le 31. Walkers and Eric Lloyd
Jones were in the pen. Punch and Judy,
sports of all kinds, and, later on, a Christmas
tree in the Agricultural Ilall. But there
was another side to it. Had the commit-
tee realised that 12,000 children and their
maternal guardians would line up outside
the hall more or less at the same moment,
better arrangements might have been made.
Worse they could hardly have been. The
iron shutters rolled down when the helpers
inside had a big contingent of kiddies to
hand the toys to. There was for some time
—-till the damage was done—no one but a
few young lads, mere straws in the mael-
strom, to keep order among the greater num-
ber still outside. The sun blazed on the
struggling women; children fell, and some-
thing like a panic began. Babies screamed,
bigger sisters howled, women fainted on the
shoulders of those uearest. and so it went
on for nearly an hour. Where was the
large and placid Bobby who takes hold of
these human cataclysms? When mothers
with inflammable tempers threatened to
“lay out” all and sundry, perhaps the noise
penetrated the iron doors. At any rate they
rolled up, and we swept forward, a broken
battalion of women, children, and “My
oath !” said an alarmed male.
Now is the time for Sydney to show that
it really wants to keep Australian musicians
and writers in their own country. By stay-
ing away from “The Rajah of Shivapore” at
the rejuvenated Playhouse it puts up a local
"No.” Mrs. Harry Austin, by way of head-
ing a “Yes” publicity campaign, invited David
Souter and Alfred Hill to lunch. Versatile
David, having nothing to do but attend to
the artistic side of the Wm. Brooks business,
do a weekly cartoon for one panel - and a
decorative cat for another, write a capital
Bulletin yarn now and again, and give
the Scotch paper and half a dozen Caledo-
nian and other societies a hand, brought
forth the book of the show; the equally idle
and equally amazing Hill, who merely teaches
all day at the Conservatorium, conducts a
few musical societies and makes concert
appearances, besides composing musical odds
and ends while he nibbles his lunch, filled in
time by writing the music. I understand
that most of the work done by Souter and
his friend was perpetrated at peep o’ dawn.
Frederick Ward and his wife. Mrs. Souter,
the Rajah Company and a few scribblers
put their feet under the table at the Aus-
tralia, while everyoody’s friend the hostess,
a pocket-edition in a rose-pink frock, beamed
under black-lace millinery. Ward, having
proposed the health of the authors and con-
veyed the thanks of the Rajah to little Mrs.
Austin, those present bustled back to their
workshops.
J. D. McKay Brown heard the usual ques-
tion put to Nina Murdoch in St. Philip’s
Church the other afternoon, and listened
while she said she would take it on. Black-
and-white artist Hal Eyre was second-best
man. and Mrs. Murdoch saw that her girl
—a dove-grey bride with a pink posy—didn’t
keep the man waiting on the step. The
’moon is to be spent “somewhere” in a glori-
fied camp-out. with the billy boiling in the
shade of a Christmas bush. Then home to
the bungalow that looks across the blue
Pacific from a Bondi cliff.
The Tom Heneys' only treasure has a
commission in the Coldstream Guards.
When war broke out the lad, then about 15,
began worrying to get into khaki. They kept
him at the King’s School instead. Too
young to enlist in the A.I.F. at 17. he left
for England last February, and got into
prompt training in the Household Brigade’s
cadet battalion at Bushey. Young Heney is
a grandson of one of Sydney’s great journal-
ists, the late Henry Gullett. Father, of
course, is editor of the S. 31. Herald.
In spite of the
war the Fan is a
necessary luxury—
you can hang it on a
wall to save it from
the fiercest knitters
who might poke holes
in its silky waist.
Water-color is the
delicate medium in
which Florence Mof-
flin’s eternal nymph
pirouettes on a pink
toe, while a faun
snatches a kiss from
a plump white cloud.
The National Gal-
lery houses one of this
young Australian
artist’s dainty fan-
cies. and her fairy-
like work was one of the decorative side-
lines of the recent Society of Artists’ show.
But Florence doesn’t take art very seriously.
The war is distracting. So are summer fashions.
She’s a daughter of pastoralist W. A. B.
Greaves and was born with an impediment—
a silver spoon in her mouth. Julian Ash-
ton attacked it with his usual vigor. And
a tour through the galleries of Europe did
a little more to sharpen her pursuit of phan-
tasies on silk. Yet the imp called Dilet-
tante still has a playful habit of tossing her
brushes aside. Then, as suddenly, she turns
to, and out flutter charming families of fairies
who dance by moonlight on a drop o’ dew
and a grass-blade.
At the latest “smart” wedding at St.
James s Church the bride was Zoe Snape. a
Manly girl, who said “I will” to 31. C.
MePhillamy. He’s one of the elan that owns
Warroo Station, Forbes. The leading lady
was garbed in a cloud of pale-pink tulle, and
was veiled in the same tint. Rainbow effects
were the motif, so bridesmaids Mary and
Bobbie Snape, reinforced by Neradah
MePhillamy. floated up behind the bride in
blue, mauve and buttercup georgette. Black
tulle millinery had been built for all three.
Party at the Persian Garden.
Tlie 4th aud 50th Battalion and Ist Aus-
tralian Machine Gun Comforts gather glit-
tering proceeds from a recent show at the
Repertory. Minnie Hooper trained cnorus-
girls from our most expensive suburbs to
simulate the real thing. But the voices were
small and uncertain —with a notable excep-
tion or two. And if the piano didn’t always
hit the same note as the girl—well, be polite
and blame the pe-ahno. Helen Macarthur
Onslow was one of the forces that kept the
sparkling entertainment together. The Mac-
arthur twins, with floating manes of dark
brown hair, were in a song-and-slide turn
with other young charmers —dried-grass cos-
tumes to the knees and green stockings.
Monty Stephen (hardy annual who lends his
aid to these dress-circle showsj, Tony Street,
Ashley Davy and Captain Verge were the
only males available for the show. Lady
Doris Blackwood, in buttercup drapery,
lisped beautifully—we don’t often hear this
once-fashionable slither over the English s—-
as the damsel who held the tame burglar at
bay. Verge, as the burglar, was a polite
drawing-room edition of the Sikes who bangs
the girl on the head and argues after. Every
other car in local Society’s garage snorted
up to the Rep. to unload our most expensive
people for both performances.
With Christmas
comes the memory of
a little paper that
used to put forth a
special number as
the year wane d.
VI an y Australian
artists—George Lam-
bert illustrated a
story by Louis Becke
in one December
i s s u e—gave their
work for a nominal
price. Why? This
benign and dignified
face, the sole pro-
perty of Miss Jose-
phine Fot h e ring-
hame, is the answer.
Upon buying Young
Australia —a juve-
nile mag., founded by Mrs. Lawson, mother
of poet Henry—after it had passed through
various vicissitudes, the new editress got to
work. Budding talent timidly offered its
first contribution, and retired, dazed by the
warm welcome it received, to go on inking
its fingers in competitions of nerve-racking-
import. Harry Julius, then in knickerbock-
ers, was one of the most persistent artists on
the juvenile side. Kutli Bedford won her
first prize for "literary” efforts at the engag-
ing age of 10, and Young Australia moth-
ered the copy. Mary and Edie Stoddart, now
on the other side, were youthful artists who
proudly signed their names as competitors.
Fred Brown sharpened his pencil in an early
attack on its pages. And the too-kind edi-
tress praised every one, aud told them all to
go on trying—which they did, with the in-
credible faith of extreme youth that moves
gallons of ink to win a pen’orth of fame.
On the adult list were the Young Aus-
tralia’s staunch friends, Percy Spence,
Frank Mahony and David Souter. with
Ernest Favenc, who took a trifling fee for
their helo to the Christmas issue because
Miss Fotheringhame shook her bonnet till its
feather stood on end if they offered to give
their services.
Born in “Fair Kirkwall.” as Scott calls
the county town of the Orkney Isles. Jose-
phine Fotheringhame is an authority on that
old Scotland which once mingled Norse
legends with its YYile tales. Steeped in the
ancient history of the town that was a royal
borough when King Hakon’s whiskers were
a feature of the landscape, she is the author
of a book for boys, published in London years
ago. It was “Sir Valdemar,” and its hero
breathed an ancient Norse atmosphere. Val-
demar having sold out. he was followed by a
Jacobite story, “The Tale in a Red Morocco
Book.” Another publication. “Tales for
Young Australia”—in this Miss Fothering-
hame was assisted by Ernest Favenc —was so
popular that there’s a chance if its coming
out again in a new edition. Young Australia
would gladly lap up some more light mental
nourishment of the same sort from its
devoted old friend, to whom it owes and gives
a deal of affection.
Lieut. Christian, a cousin of Brig.-Gen-
eral Christian, has about three vears’ ser-
vice behind him. He’s with the A.F.A. in
the firingriine—or will be. after a brief
leave in England. News of his engagement
to Jean, a daughter of Ronald Campbell,
of Bombala. has just come along. The lass
has been on the other side for some time.
Of the three Mcßride brothers from Ryde
two, Lance-Corporal Hugh and Sapper
James, have just won Military Medals.
-Ihej re with the Field Engineers. Jack
the third brother, is also at the Front This
has been their address for the last two vears.
and the chance of a rest isn’t too good on
the present count of Noes.
There’s a recent line from artist Evelyn
Chapman, now busy with mum and dad
doing war work in England. "The easel is
turned to the wall,” says the gifted 31. L
girl, "and it will stay there, so far as I ani
concerned, till the war ends. A recent visit
to St. Ives, where we meant to holiday for a
few weeks, settled that. I was going to
unpack my almost-forgotten sketch-block. But
the tragedy of the submarined was almost at
our doors, and torpedoed crews and manv
poor dead bodies were brought in during our
stay.... In each case Ivultur had fired on
the small boats after the ships had been
sunk. Struggling in heavy seas or killed as
they tried to reach the coast —there was no
sketching for me after those horrors! Only
those.who see how Gerinany makes war can
understand the living flame of hatred that
now burns in the once-stolid, easy-going Eng-
lishman.... We have sugar' tickets in
December, but otherwise the rationing has
been voluntary.... Father is losing his
figure. Mother and I deal out the bread
with an iron hand and weigh the 2oz.
allowed an adult for each meal.”
The Chapmans have no son, but their
London home is the headquarters of innu-
merable relatives on leave in Blighty. One,
a young cousin, is that Captain Edmund
Cornish who got his captaincy and the M.C.
at 19. He was through Gallipoli in the old
13th Battalion, has been wounded and
patched up several times, and celebrated his
20th birthday in the great push. Ilis people
are in Sydney.
The Mamma State has a semi-detached
interest in a recent wedding in London. The
man was Sergeant Victor McLean. Dragoons,
a great-grandson of George William Evans,
an Australian explorer and a one-time sur-
veyor in Tassy. Gladys Gwendoline Shayer.
of Kensington-in-Fog. was the lady in white.
Neville Cayley, only son of the late bird
artist and a brushman himself, has been
quietly wed to Beatrice Doust, of Cronulla.
Neville makes that picturesque seashore his
abiding place.
Lieut. Reg. Spofforth. elder son of the
Demon bowler, has annexed Yvonne, a
daughter of the late London Spofforth. of
Richmond (Eng.). The bride is a grand-
daughter of the late Markham Spofforth.
Senior Taxing Master in Chancery. He
was the man who undertook to half-sole and
heel the Conservatives, at the request of
"Dizzy,” when Peel lost their support by
the repeal of the Corn Laws.
A Manly soldier. Clive Crosbie Murray,
chose an English bud a few weeks ago. She
is Eva Preston, of Old Alresford Rectory,
Hampshire. Father tied the knot.
Mrs. Harry Rickards keeps her husband’s
memory green by giving a full-and-plenty
Christmas dinner as usual. Her guests will
be a thousand of the poor in this city.
Mrs. Abbott, of the Scottish Women’s
Hospital Fund, has gone to Maoriland on the
usual raid. Invereareill will he lucky ff it
can hang on to saxpence as well as its Tam
o’ Shanter.
Major Ilowden, a Victorian who joined
up in Sydney as a private in the 13th. was
killed a few weeks ago in France. “A splen-
did man and adored by his fellows,” writes
Evelyn.
“Australia Jane” from Bananaland:—
Sister Eileen King, daughter of T. M. King,
formerly our Comnihsioner of Railways, has been
sent to England from France, suffering from severe
bomb wounds, the gentle exponents of kultur appar-
ently having been at their old game of bombing
hospitals. Sister Amy, also within sound of the big
guns, was on a hospital ship off Gallipoli, where she
had several narrow escapes.

True Economy
IS TO UTILISE EVERY POUND TO BEST ADVANTAGE
—never to let your money lie idle. Economise, too, your
time! Don't waste an hour.
Apply this economical principle to musical instruments. Perhaps
you have a Piano standing idle. Never played from one week's end
to the other. Many pounds of hard-earned money doing nothing.
Opportunity for enjoyment cobwebbed by misuse.
Convert this “ever-closed” Piano into an “ever-open” PIANOLA,
and soon you will feel the money well invested, drawing you good
dividends in the pleasure thus created. Music, one of life's greatest
assets, is then appreciated and utilised in its fullest value.
Think also of the valuable time saved! No wasted years of
practice! All now superseded by the acquisition of a PIANOLA
PIANO.
YOU ARE CAUTIONED AGAINST THE MANY IMITATORS OF
THIS NOTED PIANOLA. It is in the PIANOLA only that you get full,
sterling worth. Competent comparison reveals substantial saving.

My Dear Yarrie, —
The vice-regal Stanleys, off to Maeedon
for the warm months, have already put in
some melting moments on the mountain side.
By the way, young Edward Stanley. looms
large in the home circle since he sported a
Grammar cap. The youth wears his hands
in his pockets, talks of moving incidents in
the tented field, and affects a spirit of
democracy in the best public-schoolboy
manner.
Canon Drought went over to the arch-
angels a week ago, leaving a devoted wife
to mourn. She was the elder of the Godr
frey sisters. The Droughts were visiting
the Fog when the war broke out, and son
Charley, who was with his parents, hurried
into khaki rightaway. He served 12 months
ere falling in the trenches. Only brother
John also arrived from Australia to do his
bit, and now holds a British captain’s com-
mission and a Military Cross. Toorak will
miss the old Canon. He had been in charge
of its most-fashionable Anglican tabernacle
since the retirement through ill-health of
that good clerical sport, the late Fellowes.
The other afternoon the Austral Salon,
with Dame Madden in command, bestowed an
official welcome on the new Mayoress, Mrs.
Frank Stapley. The chairlady, looking re-
juvenated, presented a beautiful lilies-of-the-
valley bouquet and some pretty flowers of
speech to the lady-of-honor, who fired off an
appreciative reply. Mayoress Stapley is
one of the quick talkers who speak feelingly.
When she is pleased she looks it, and when
she isn’t she doesn’t dissemble very much.
Then Mrs. Secretary Quinnell heaped com-
plimentary references on Walter Kirby, inci-
dental to his first appearance since he
parted with his appendix. Walter added a
trio of melting warbles to his expressions
of thanks, by way of assuring the company
that though he had lost his P.S., so to speak,
the sweet note was in the old place.
The least inartistic section of Melbourne
society went into mental mourning last
Thursday, when the Herald spread the news
that Fred McCubbin was dead. He had
meant so much to the artistic world during
his 33 years of teaching at Melbourne
National Gallery. He was a gentle mentor ;
something of a Bohemian whose mellifluous
little tenor warble had been a popular item
at many a smoke night; an amiable nhilo-
sopher and discourser on politics and litera-
ture, as well as art; the estimable husba r '
of bright and busy Mrs. McCubbin, and
“always the little gentleman.” Ilis parental
feelings and natural kindliness tended to
shorten Fred McCubbin’s useful life. The
outbreak of the war saddened him at once.
Anxiety for his son Hugh, who went away
with the first contingent and was wounded
at Gallipoli, made an old man of him at 60.
The work of the gifted painter lives after
him. The disappearance of his personality
is a real loss to Melbourne. He leaves no
enemies nor any harsh critics that I ever
heard of. Few artists of his ability can
have been so utterly devoid of unpleasant
characteristics.
The John Madden pair, assisted by daugh-
ter Lesley from the undies shop, and Mrs.
Guy, will eat their Christmas pudding at
Frankston. Daughter Beatrice, with her
babies, is sheltering in London with the
Vallanges until her husband, Harry Baillieu,
can bring her back to Australia next month.
The Edward Stones, of Westralia, are
making one of their occasional visits to
Melbourne and are staying at Menzies’. j.nis
time the Gropers’ Lieut.-Governor and re-
tired Chief Justice is over to have some
talks with an eye specialist.
However, as there is no serious danger of
loss of sight, he is quite cheerful about the
matter. The chief trouble, so far, is that
he is unable to recognise his old friends
except at very close quarters. The trip
across was made by the new transcon-
tinental, and the travellers reckon it’s a
splendid improvement on the old toss-and-
tumble by sea. Mrs. Norman Ewing, who
used to be Maude Stone and hadn’t seen her
mother for five years, has been up from
Hobart with a Ewing grand-daughter, but
had to go back early to fix up the family
Christmas-tree.
The Lang clan, of Lismore, is rejoicing
over the return of Captain Stewart Lang
from the Front. After a couple of -wounds
he has been passed out with an honorary
captaincy of the K. O. Scottish Borderers.
(No, strictly that doesn’t mean Knock Out.
In the Best Circles it stands for King’s
Own.)
Major Knox Knight, now somewhere in
France, hasn’t won the V.C. yet; but he has
had the agreeable experience of writing the
report on which a brother Australian, Cap-
tain Robert Grieve, Y.C., reached that sum-
mit. Mrs. Knight, by the way, is a
“Friendly Soldier’s Wife,” and almost any
day of the week her wraith-like figure may
be seen flitting by on the way to succor the
victims of a time-payment raid or to apply
first-aid to some mother-of-fourteen who has
been gassed by an impatient landlord.
Vivian de Crespigny, whose dad manages
the Bank of Victoria, now has his majority
and the Military Cross, besides a notable
record of mentions. He joined the R.F.C.
at 18.
Young Thornton Grimwade has gone into
Maribyrnong camp. He left Melbourne
Grammar at midwinter, and then dabbled
awhile in scientific chemistry with uncle
Russell Grimwade, who has been in charge
of the Bria.-General’s son since mother went
to England. The Norton Grimwades, by the
way, have left their flat, to settle once more
in the Toorak mansion they acquired from
Norman Hodges.
The Tahitians were being entertained in
a. South Yarra garden. Soon there was a
line of spectators at the fence. “Toffs hob-
nobbing with the niggers,” one explained.
“Yes,” said his political neighbor, “and
they’re asking you and me to go and fight
alongside ’em.” “That’s right,” said the old
lady who was also having a look. “Don’t
you lose your pride. You stay home and let
the niggers fight for your missus.”
Major Ted Cordner, who went over to
patch our wounded some months back, is the
latest victim. His heart became exceedingly
unwell after encountering Margaret Pruen,
a member of a Cheltenham family, and he
now feels the case demands a parson and a
choral service. The operation is booked for
an early date in 1918.
Professor Wallace has shed his sergeant’s
stripes and wears a star. Others in the
clutch, including Franklin, of the Grammar
School, and Reg Raleigh, are finishing their
military education in Sydney. The pro-
fessor-lieutenant is smiling again now, his
small boy having made a fine recovery after
several desperate weeks of appendicitis.
Miss Adelaide subscribes:—
From London comes news of the marriage of Mrs.
E. J. Peck to Lieut. George Bryce, who was once
Assistant Botanist at some unpronounceable place in
Ceylon, and is now with the R.A.M.C. She, before
her first marriage, was Katie Magarey, daughter of
the James Magareys, of North Adelaide.
On Fiiday a Christmas fair at Torrensville, under
the guiding hand of Mrs. Thomson Green (he is the
M.P. for the district), added to the Trench Comforts
Fund’s bank balance, and a fete at Medindie divided
its proceeds between the same fund, the Cottage
Homes and the Walkerville orphanage. The Burn-
side Repatriation Fund got the profits from a horses-
in-action show at the Kensington Oval, and on Tues-
day Trench Comforts workers took possession of the
Town Hall, hired Father Christmas, arranged stalls
with every variety of buyable oddment, and conducted
a Children s Christmas Party to get money for the
A.C.F. coffee-stalls at the Front. The mothers of
the 10th and 50th Battalions gave their children
a Christmas Tree and Christmas Tea on the Parlia-
ment House lawns on Saturday, and a picnic for
soldiers’ wives and children was managed by the
Unley Soldiers’ Wives committee. While I’m on
these funds I must tell you that the Cheer-up Society
has taken stock of its year’s expenditure, and has
announced that its provision bill for 12 months
was over £4OOO, and that fuel and light cost £240
for the same period, which is a three-cheer result.
Dreaming of soldiers reminds me that the Home
at Fullarton has added a recreation hall. It was
opened by Lady Galway on Saturday.
1 lince Alfred College is to have a bronze bust
of Fred Chappie as a memento of his • 30 years’
headmastership. G. A. Barnes, of the Art Gallery
has the job.
A Military Cross has come to Lieut. Vincent, son
of Major Vincent. Only 18. And—now steady—he
has held a commission in the Royal Lancashires for
nearly two years !
Died at North Adelaide on Thursday, Mrs. De
Rose, whose husband at one time had charge of the
Ordnance Department of the S.A. Military Force.
She was born in Birmingham 92 years ago, and came
to this State with her husband in ’66. I never
heard her say that she would like to go back to
Birmingham.
Ruby Davy, one of our girls, is the first woman
musician in the Commonwealth whose composition
to win a Mus. Doc. degree has been accepted by the
board of examiners.
More than one Melbourne woman had a
passing “hot and cold” spasm when she read
that old “Arthur Worthington” had breathed
his last in a New York gaol. The magnetic
Arthur started his babble of Isis and Osiris
in America, the mother-land of crude-
molasses doctrines. He came to Maoriland
22 years ago and did a dash at Christchurch,
of all places, before trying his luck in Syd-
ney and then Melbourne. A tall man, with
piercing dark eyes and effective white hair,
Worthington was adored by all the women
who fell into his treacly cult. He preached
Love and took their money. The widow
of a Sydney merchant was the Rev. Arthur’s
most lucrative adorer, and she eventually
had the pluck to lay an information before
the-police and tell her artless tale in court.
He did some years of penal servitude in
Beechworth Gaol, and then returned to
America and flourished awhile on the same
old lines. What Arthur didn’t know about
the mysterious affinities between the sexes
wasn’t worth knowing. He was a born lady-
killer of the soulful sort. Yet he carried his
twin warnings on either side of his attractive
phiz. His ears ought to have given him
away. They were set too low, or too far
back, and everybody ought to know that
the surest sign of an impostor is a pair of
misplaced wings. But women are mostly
blind to such signs of the crimes. They
don’t even feel an instinctive distrust of a
square head if it contains two blue eyes
and a decent set of t&eth.
Medical meh seem to change their invalid-
diet ideas with their calendars. In 1915
there was an immense demand for mutton-
shanks, which make a nice broth without
much bother. Last year brought a clamor
for small orders of gravy-beef, shanks being
almost neglected. Now the profesh, seems
to have decided that there is no particular
nourishment in broth or beef-tea, and has
gone baldheaded for sheep’s brains. It’s a
tantalising position for the butcher, since
there is only one head on each sheep, while
one strong invalid, trying to make up for
lost time, can get through the mental works
of three animals inside 24 hours. Besides,
I like ’em myself—cooked in a skillet with
a bit of sage and butter and turned out on
a square of toast.
Margaret Thomas and Elizabeth Glover,
who have made such a success of the Trained
Nurses’ Club, have been secured by an astute
proprietary to run the household side of
Craig’s Hotel, Ballarat. A send-off by the
nurses is to happen at an early date.
Marjorie Raphael is back in Melbourne for
a little while, ever so much plumper than the
slim girl of six years ago, and looking in-
tensely like an' actress. She wears beaute-
ous pearls and is staying at Menzies’. The
war lost no time in making fair Marjorie
a relict. One Friday her husband, Norman
Raphael, left England with his brigade. The
next Friday he was dead on the Flanders
Front. What his blonde young relict thinks
about the war and its management is vastly
different from what the Censor permits to
be printed about it.
Ex-Gaud Mayor Ilenriessy and his dame
have gone down to Frankston to eat their
turkey and plum-pudding and forget all
about the ingratitude of man.
A garden fete raged lately over the Toorak
lawns and flower-beds of the John Grice
pair. The stallholders were all successfully
or unsuccessfully powdered and patched in
the Georgian mode, although the whole
bazaar frenzy had been christened Early
English. The young things handing round
the buttered buns looked just it in white
draperies with mob caps on their floured
locks. _ The Grice dame sounded the opening
note in a neat little speech, and emptied a
well-filled purse to help the show, which was
in aid of the local St. Martin’s.
Fulford, lately British Consul at Tien-
tsin, who gave up the job to enjoy the com-
fort of his native Australia, found he could
not endure standing outside the great
Chinese question which has been born out of
the world-wide war. He has gone north
again, leaving his wife and little daughter to
await events.
The Central Branch of the Soldiers’ Wives
Friendly Union got through the Christmas
frivol this year without a hitch. No pirates
stormed the festive scene this time and got
away with the goods as in 1916. Manager
Denton came in with the loan of Hoyt’s
Olympia, and the staff gave its services.
Nearly 2000 kiddies and beaming mothers
turned up. General Hughes’s missus took
command in the absence of Lady Helen, and
the wives of the best brass hats gave a hand.
The youngest of squatter Quin’s three
unmarried girls has accepted the usual

He is now preparing to fly. Mereta,

The L. K. S. Mackinnon matron ma
daughter Margot have spent many busy
weeks making garments of strange design
for a regiment of kewpies. These eccentS
trifles are being sold to swell the Leaein
funds. Here and there, though, you begin to
find a kick aimed at the worship of these
freak dolls as a thing calculated to warn the
young ideals—“ The Cult of the Monstrous”
it is termed. And there’s some force in the
term. Long years ago John Ruskin passed
caustic remarks on the same thing.
Muriel Atherton, who is to marry Captain
Geoff Grice, did not sparkle quite so brightly
as the two elder sisters in our pre-war smart
set. But she used a paintbrush and neneil
with skill. The family drifted to the Fog
two years ago. Captain Geoff, like brother
Claude, is keen on horseflesh, and did not
shine in two-stepping circles. He never got
into dress-clothes without strong inducement
Ilis mother was a Sumner. The Grices and
Sumners were partners in the firm-that-was.
Walter Kirby celebrated his divorce from
his appendix with an impromptu vocal recital
the other night. Walter ransacked his
repertoire for the benefit of the Red Cross
and filled two or three hats. Previous to
departing from Mount St. Evin’s Hospital
the young man sang to the sisters and lifted
the roof off with his impassioned warbling.
Anybody with a stray roof that he cannot
account tor might forward same to the hospi-
tal as soon as possible.
Lieut. Heron; son of the Commercial Bank
manager, is figuring once more on the list of
wounded. Shirkers will please note that
Heron made one at the Gallipoli Landing,
soon after which he- lost the sight of an eye!
For some months he was in hospital, but got
back to Gallipoli in time for the closing
scene. Since then he has been again and
again in other fighting lines until the shrap-
nel caught him. At Dalgety’s, where he
worked in pre-war days, the clerks talk
admiringly of him, and the girl section is
said to be thinking of a novelty in welcomes.
Their last outburst was for Lieut. Butler,
who came back on one leg. Butler still
blushes at his recollections. The males stood
up and cheered whilst the womankind pelted
him with roses, as though he were Juflus
Beaucaire.
The W. J. T. Clarke people have locked
the doors of their Toorak place and buzzed
off to Mt. Schank, the family sheep-run in
South Aus.
Mrs. Cottrell Dormer has drifted here
from Tassy to meet her husband, the British
major, who is coming back on short leave.
The poor lady is still shaking at the recollec-
tion of that awful night when, going down to
a summer-house for her knitting-bag, she was
half-throttled by a robber, who got clean
away with her best finger-gems and neck
gauds.
The General Bridges widow has taken a
houselet at Frankston, so that the sea
breezes may blow the office cobwebs out of
the hats of daughters Dorothy and Babbie at
Aveek-ends. Dorothy adds and subtracts for
the E. S. and A. Bank ; Babbie toils at the
Barracks.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Fanuela”: While the billy boiled Billy
Wilson told me about it. “I was scrub-falling at
Kingarov last year,” he said, “and took a contract
to do 150 acres. I started on Monday, and had
finished brushing and nicked all the trees by Friday.
Then I went to the top of the hill, where the largest
bottle-tree in the district was standing, cut it down
on Saturday morning, and went to collect my cheque.
The farmer was astonished. ‘Finished already!’ he
said. I said I had, collected, and spent Sunday' in
Brisbane. Six weeks later I went back to Kingaroy,
and that scrub was still falling!”
“Devilfish” ; There was excitement in the
Speck a few years ago when 50 whales came ashore
at Perkins Island, on the north-west coast; but this
was nothing to a recent stranding at Cloudy Bay, a
lonely inlet at the southern end of Bruny Island. A
man who visited the remote place recently came on
between 120 and 130 whales on the
beach, and some of them were beg!
ning to shriek to Heaven about the.r
bad luck.
“Snell”: It was necessary for the honor of
Australia to dull the edge of a small Scot who was
talking of windy conditions he had experienced in
the China seas. “Talkin’ of wind,” said John,
“there ain’t nothin’ windier blows than the willy-
willies of Westralia. I was caught in one once, ’n’
when it started blow in’ houses at me, I got into
the solidest-lookin’ holler tree I could find, ’n’
waited for the chunks to pass. There was nothin’
didn’t blow by while I was in there. There was-
a whole ’orse ’n’ cart goin’ five foot from the
ground, with the bloke drivin’ ez if nothin’ out of
the ordinary was ’appenin’. All the time I'm
thinkin’ I'm all right, till, whiz! bang! somethin'
hit the tree, ’n’ I’m put out with shock. When
I recovers it’s dark ’n’ still, but I’m a pris’ner.
The openin’ I got in at is barred. When daylight
(omes I’m wise enough. The wind had tore up a
rail from the railway a mile off, heaved it through
the air, ’n’ swished it agin the tree-trunk with
such a swipe it curled round twice, ’n’ there was
1 barred in, a hopeless, ’elpless fixture.” John
ceased talking, and resumed the greasing of
his harness. “But how did you get out?” asked
the Scotchman. “I ain’t macle up me mind,” said
John. “Ain’t made up yer mind? What do you
mean—you ain’t made up your mind?” “I don't
know,” said John, “whether the sun was so hot
that day it melted the iron or the willy-willy come
on again ’n' blew the rail back. I ain’t made up
me mind.”
“G.J.H.” : When driving between Bruthen
and Nowa Nowa (Vic.) a day or two ago we raised
a mob of kangaroos of the grey flier variety. As the
last of the mob, a big buck, crossed the road, he
suddenly staggered and fell. We examined him care-
fully. ile appeared to have suddenly lost the use of
his hind legs, but there was no sign of either frac-
ture or dislocation. We helped him to his feet, but
he immediately toppled over again and when we
passed that way a few hours later he was dead. There
was no trace of a wound and no indications of
snake-bite or poison. Heart failure from fright?
“Spud” : Billjim Camellero isn't proud of
himself in his capacity of ship-of-the-desert naviga-
tor, and feels miserable whenever he meets a Light
Horseman’s amused and superior grin. I am skipper
of a brute the boys call H.M.S. Stinker, and although
lm not really in love with myself when on the
bridge, I don't object so much as some to the beast,
in spite of his itch, septic sores, smell, mange and
reckless speed. I remember it to his credit that,
when there’s nothing else to burn in this denuded
Holy Land, the ugly old bag of tricks produces the
usual substitute without extra charge. Giddup!
“E.11.H.": Re distance a camel can be
ridden in one day. Unless the steed with a hump
has deteriorated, “Cole” (B. 22/11/’l7) has not met
a Carbine. In the early 90’s for a wagfer a camel
was ridden from Southern Cross to Coolgardie in a
few minutes under 10 hours; distance, approxi-
mately, 120 miles. Another riding camel owned by
the late W. R. Wilson, and well known about
Menzies, would think “Cole’s” 65 to 70 miles in a
daj a pipe-opener. The camel may be a bit smell-
ful, but he’s a goer of quality.
VALUED.
"Now, it ain't everyone I’d sell ’ er to. ’Arry, but if you wants a real good ’orse I'll let
you 'are ’er reasonable.”
"That's all right, Charlie. I’d take er. only I 'ate breakin ’ into a quid.”
“Quill Driver”: From actual experience
one knows that you can't buy a cane in Malacca,
there are 110 Brazil-nuts in Brazil, no hair-oil is
made in Macassar, and no long boots can be bought
in Wellington. But this last is the unkindest cut
FAST QUALITIES.
SMART DEALER : “Oh, not a had line of
wethers, Mr. Jumbuck, but very
burry, and there's nothing sticks to
a sheep like Bathurst burr."
MR. JUMBUCK: “Except the price I have
on them 'ere sheep."
of all—a fox-terrier is afraid of a fox! Attended a
fox hunt recently in a Victorian village—not the
sort conducted by the Quo.rn or the Beauvoir Hunt
Club, but a chase got up by the lads of the village
after a puppy fox which ran up a drain in the main
street. They burnt brown paper, bark, cow pats,
picture-show posters, referendum circulars and three-
penn’orth of sulphur, all to no purpose. Then three
fox-terriers were tugged along and pushed violently
up the drain. Directly they sniffed the fox the
dogs, squealing and yelping with fright, dashed
out of the hunt. It raised the grave suspicion that
a fox-terrier is called one because he’s afraid of a fox.
Also it raises a big question: Is any dog any use for
anything? One can understand a horse or a cow or
a sheep being some good to somebody, but a dog—-
well, no wonder they tax dogs and bachelors.

“Ftp. Enterprise” : I want to introduce a
good Australian. On Mafeking Day, as a boy, I
brought home about a dozen young rosella-parrots from
the bush and distributed all but one amongst friends.
With the exception of this one all have since died.
The survivor is over 17 years of age and as well as
ever he was. I put it down to feeding him on the
flowers of the common milk-thistle. I saw one of
his relatives about 12 months ago in the London Zoo
competing, among a host of other birds of the world,
in the Beautiful Plumage Stakes, and winning every
time.

“Jas. Hyde”: “Mrs. Lance Rawson” (B.
22/11/’l7) complains that “many writers allude to
all aboriginal women as lubras, whereas a lubra is a
young gin before she takes a mate.” When giving
the meaning of any abo. word the part of Australia
in which it is used should be stated. There are many
abo. languages and dialects in Australia, and a word
in one lingo often means something very different
from a word of the same sound used in another part
of this dustheap. Before me is a pamphlet purporting
to give the meaning of abo. words. “Wild animal”
is the meaning attached to one word. It may be the'
meaning of the word in some localities, but in Com-
laroi it has a shockingly indecent meaning. As far
as I’ve investigated the matter I’ve never yet been
able to prove that the word lubra originally belonged
to any Queensland abo. language. In the early days
I never heard it used by the blacks around Broad
Sound, Mackav or Bowen, nor on the Isaacs and
Suttor rivers. 1 admit that I'd little chance of get-
ting information from the murris, for at that time
they were not allowed in on most stations in those
parts. Incidentally, a complaint having been made
about stock being interfered with, native police came
and “dispersed” the offending tribe. In plain English,
the camps were rushed suddenly and as many male
adults shot down as convenient. I once asked a native
policeman if lie ever shot gins. His answer was:
‘.My wud, plenty time!” As for abos. being canni-
bals, the first cases of habitual cannibalism that I
can personally vouch for happened on the Johnstone
River, and it is probable that some of the tribes
north of Cardwell were cannibals more from choice
than want. All the blacks south of the Burdekin that
I came in contact with in the early times were quite
indignant if it was suggested that they were man-
eaters. I never heard Jimmy Morrel say a wo H
the blacks eating human flesh, and he had Hv f 1
years among them in the Bowen district befnrtVJ
whites settled there. After an absence of 35 the
I returned to the North in 1909, and have ''b^
ambling about north of Townsville since. I find in
some of the different languages on the coast words
of Kanaka, Chow, Hindu and Jap origin mixed with
the ancient yabber, and people who know nothing of
abo. lingo make curious mistakes in consequence.

“Jimmie Pannikin” : When I was in the
beautiful Yass-Gundagai district (N.S.W.) I saw
some queer bird-nests. A swallow made its home in
a cup that had been left on one of the beams inside
tiie Derringullen half-time school, a few miles out
of Yass. The headmaster, William Patrick Faulder,
an ardent nature lover, took the nest-lined cup down
for me to inspect, but he was careful not to touch
the rim of the vessel. In due course the brood was
hatched, and the cup-nest was kept as a specimen
in the school's most interesting museum. At the
Rugby provisional school, in charge of another bush-
lover, Ernest Collins, I was shown a thrush’s ne*t
built in a biscuit-tin used as a flower-pot. The
flower-tin was just at the side of the door, on a
GIVING IT TO HIM IN THE NECK.

stand about 2ft. high. So tame was the thrush
that i saw it sitting on the eggs, while the bush-
bairnies inarched in and out of school — very quietly.
Ihe bigger pupils would often hold up the little
ones of the infant class to have a look at the sitting
bird, who seemed quite unconcerned. If the children
put their hands on the tin too long for Madame
Mavis's liking, she gave them a gentle peck or two.
During that and the following year four broods were
hatched. Next, the headmaster at Muttama, P. B-
Clune, another keen nature-student, showed me a
willy-wagtail sitting on its nest, which had been
built upon the top of a wooden tripod used as a
map-stand. The mother-bird used to squat calmly
and watch the children come and go. Incidentally
every school in Australia should have and use Leach s
admirable birdbook, and every genuine, or even .75
genuine, birdlover should also have a copy.

“Look you slippy, my young mister—
Not a drop for washin’ father, and his knock-off
time is near.”^
Luggin’ water is a treat
That would break a giajit’s heart;
In the smoke and in the heat,
Tinglin’ eyes and burnin’ feet!
Two full buckets at the start —
Home with ’arf it if you’re smart;
Some you spill and some you swaller.
Twenty trips and more to foller—-
With the heat that ole rain-barrel’s gone and fairly
bust apart.
Now the sun his flamin’ spears
Flicks behind the ranges grey,
And the north wind grills and sears,
And my strainin’ joints appears
’Zif they’d surely pull away.
Them there youngsters I could flay,
Drinkin’ when they didn’t oughter,
And I'm prayin’, totin’ water,
Deal take and fry the feller went inventin’ washin'-
day!

“Ornis”: Dudley Le Souef, of the Mel-
bourne Zoo, has lately been rest-curing in Tassy, and,
incidentally, lecturing on behalf of patriotic funds.
Tiie other day at Hobart, in the course of a lecture
on birdlife, he passed some very forceful remarks
concerning a notice on all the Speck’s railway
stations offering a reward for the heads of hawks.
Next day the matter was taken up in Parliament,
and members of the Government tumbled over them-
selves in their anxiety to disclaim responsibility for
the notice. I have had a somewhat extended experi-
ence with all the smaller hawks, and can assert,
after having examined some scores of stomachs, that,
with the exception of the sparrow-hawk, all of these
birds do far more good than harm. The brown
hawk, so often seen around farms, and more fre-
quently shot than any other kind, I have never
found wdth anything other than the remains of
moths or grass-feeding caterpillars inside. The
swamp-hawk is far keener on young- rabbits, rats and
bandicoots than on chickens. The harriers and
kestrels live almost exclusively on four-legged ver-
min. I am willing to admit that all hawks take an
occasional chicken, but such lapses are more than
outweighed by the all-the-y ear-round good work
they do.

“John Quill”: There is great truth in
what was said in the Abo. column -some weeks' ago,
viz., that our blacks are subject to a spasmodic
desire .to kill which may assert itself at any time.
An aborigine who has any regard for your health w 11
not allow you to proceed ahead of him in the bush.
The writer and others used to go out shooting near
Wagga (N.S.W.) with a blackfellow named Barney.
Barney would never allow us to go in front of him,
and he would even use force to make us cbm-
ply with his wishes. In our ignorance we always
imputed such conduct to his selfish desire to get the
best shots. Barney was well treated by his em-
ployer, he had little work to do, and received good
pay. He was deeply attached to his boss, and the
boss looked agreeably upon him. One day Barney
stole something and was scolded. Not long after-
wards he made an attempt upon the boss's life, and
was sentenced to six months’ gaol. He died of fret-
ting after three weeks’ confinement. I’ve known
Westralian blacks pull a friend back when he
attempted to take the lead, saying “Badja” and
tapping their heads. They mean “that sulky feller
tellem kill.”
“F.R.S.” : I’ve cursed Barcoo rot with the
best of you. Last June I was dropped into an
irrigation area in N. S. Wales to carry on the job
of schoolmaster. A few weeks later I had to use
the chalk with hands that were encased in packing.
I had good scran, too. My neighbor, a resident of
three years, has again developed the rot. He in-
forms me it was prevalent in Broken Hill, while
another resident avers that it belongs to Riverina
only. The area doctor told me that the channel-
builders were greatly troubled with the ailment, and
that it took him three years to discover an oint-
ment to cure it. By the way, can any bargain-
hunter beat this? Any family here, father, mother
and flock up to the age of 16, can gtet medical
attendance and medicine for 10s. per quarter.
hE WAS FEELING CHARITABLE.
L OAFER: “'Souse me, sir, but I s'pose y'
don't know of a long beer what wants er
good ’ome?”
“J. J.D.’’: A sow owned by me and reared
on Breakfast Creek station, Cowra (N.S.W.), aged
two years, recently gave birth to 19 fully-developed
young ones. Four were suffocated owing to the
mother lying on them; but the others are doing
well. Can any abo. sty come one on this?
HIS PROFESSIONAL PRIDE.
CHORUS OF INTERESTED BACKERS (to recalcitrant principal): “Wot! Ain't yer goin ’
ter fight him. Chiller?”
CHILLER: “No; the bloke wot promised to take the pictures ain't turned up.”
“Steve Hart’’: I won't have it that a
rosella parrot is the one perfect bait for foxes (B.
1/11/’l7). His nibs wall take on any bird, even
crows. Here’s another cert. When you’ve fin-
ished your lunch of sardines, into the remaining oil
put strychnine and a little carbonate of soda, and
the fox is yours—-two if it’s the honeymoon season.
Also, when laying strychnine and jam for rabbits,
don’t waste money on oil of rhodium or aniseed, etc.,
as an attraction. Use good old eucalyptus oil, 12
of 15 drops to 21b. jam, and —well, mine's a pot
when you sell the skins.

“Bad Australian”: Away back in the
winter of ’O7 I was in charge of a tunnelling job
close up to the summit of the Andes. The mountains
were covered deep with snow, and one after-
noon, just as shifts were being changed, an
immense avalanche came down across the
tunnel mouth. The men who were inside
were all right; but the remainder of the
crowd, some 10 or 12, accompanied the slide
to the bottom of the gulch—about a mile
below. Those who were imprisoned in the
tunnel soon dug a way out and started to
prospect for their pals, a task which seemed
fairly hopeless. But they stuck to it like
machinery, and early next morning they
struck four or five cadavers frozen as stiff as
logs. I met several half-breeds coming down
towing what looked like sleig’hs behind them.
The sleighs turned out to be frozen corpses.
Each difunto was snaked along over the
hard, frozen snow by a lasso hitched around
its ankles for convenience of traction, and
most of them had the points of the hips and
shoulders worn down so flat that the articula-
tion of the joints showed like the graining
of an oaken panel. In one case the head had
suffered so much from attrition that about
one-fourth of the skull had been filed to a
perfectly flat surface. When I started in to
lecture one of the boys about inhuman con-
duct he simply shrugged his shoulders and
said, “Que vamos hacer, senor! They don't
feel it and it is easier to slide a man to his
last home in the Cordillera than to carry
him.” Seeing that it was no use arguing I
gave the boys a good nip all round and signed
the burial certificate.
“Dr. Nil’’: Long ago I read Mark Twain’s
remarks upon the ant. To-day I stood over a green-
head’s nest with one doorway, and tried to make
sense out of what the greenies were up to. It was
a warm afternoon and sunny, so the wise insects were
extra lively—though of course not half so rapid
as their 1-32 inch, congeners, the pismires. Several
were meandering around the dwelling, apparently,
like Sandy Macpherson, looking for a policeman to
tel? them where they lived. One of them suddenly
stumbled over his own doorstep, and immediately
dived half-way in, hesitated and backed out again;
rushed hysterically up and down the landscape for
a minute or so, and then fell into his hole again
by accident. A moment later he reappeared, stagger-
ing upstairs with a dead greenie in his pincers, and,
hoisting it over his left shoulder, made off at 50.9
miles per hour over the very roughest track he
could pick towards the jungle of barley-grass under
the fig-tree. No ant-nest known to me existed in that
direction. Presently a small pearly object appeared
coming out of the upcast; it proved to be a newly-
hatched egg in the jaws of a panting, straining ant,
who rushed away with it in the same direction as
No. 1, but by a different and, if possible, more im-
possible track. Some anxious minutes elapsed. Then
another I.W.W. exploded from the home hole with
a friend’s corpse and made a traverse around the
village and finally disappeared, bearing west-by-south-
three-quarters-west, towards the fig-tree. Later, two
greenies, wandering about in search of pleasure and
fresh air, met near the homestead sliprails and
failed to give the password. Promptly No. 1, who
was the bigger of the two, seized No. 2, using his
mandibles, hoisted him overhead and pranced off
with him to the cemetery under the fig-tree, in spite
of explanations and blasphemy on the part of the
weaker vessel. Later, more eggs were rushed west-
ward, more defunct ants were carted towards the
fig-tree. Then a small pismire fell foul of one of
the I.W.W.’s, and grabbed him by the middle groin
and held on like a bulldog. I.W. tried to get his
tweezers into pismire. No go—the latter was on to
his blind spot and I left them doing jiu-jitsu. About
sundown I went back to see the finish, but all I could
find was the undertaker straggling back with the
late lamented and looking for home, sweet home,
which he couldn t find. The difference between
instinct and reason ’ is that the latter can result
in mistakes, the former cannot. I said that years
ago. Now, have these frantic workers at nothing-in-
particular got “instinct” or “reason,” or are they
merely human ?
* * * *
“Jobber”: Here in England one rarely gets
any news of Australia except through the British
Australasian. No wonder the average inhabitant
of the country still knows very little of Australia;
and what’s more, he doesn’t seem interested. As for
the farmers—well, they’re pretty hopeless. Some of
them are good ; others are just cattle-dealers. Would
you believe it, they don’t, as a rule, christen their
COU'S t
“Banyena”: Here’s my personal experi-
ence. I was three summers in the Mallee (Quarnba-
took district) after the 1902 drought, and was
attacked by Rarcoo rot in the first and third years,
although I was living on good average tucker The
last season I was there (1905-’O6) the spew was very
bad, seasoned cookies being attacked with the same
enthusiasm as newchmns. I found the sudden-death
cure—leave the district. In 1904-’O5 the flies were
"xtra-bad, but there was no sign of rot or spew
Ihe furthest-south case of rot that I know of was
at Horsham (Vic.). That was not long ago
“Ses” : It looks as if the carpet-snake, one
of our largest reptiles and one worth preserving, will
be the first to disappear. Its habitat was only a
small strip of the eastern coast, where it was once
very plentiful, but is now rare. Our fowlhouse used
to be raided by the variegated- wriggler on an aver-
age about twice a week. A frantic squawk in the
night would be the signal to get after the burglar.
If we arrived promptly we found the python on the
roost, trying to get down without losing the poul-
try ; and w'hen it flopped on to the ground it pro-
vided as much excitement as two native cats. We
were sorry to be rude to him, for the carpet has
good points. In rat- or mice-haunted places it can
be recommended before the family cat. It is easily
tamed, and is a perfectly safe pet once it has been
taught to keep out of one’s bed. We placed one in
a big barn that was over-run with mice, and it
remained there, sleeping on the ridge-pole during
the day, till the rodents had all disappeared, though
men were working in the barn every day. Another
was lodged in a dairy. One morning it was found
swimming in the big vat of overnight milk. It
proved to have a weakness for milk, so we had to
issue a regulation under the War Precautions Act.
“J.N.A.”: The 320-miles stretch of
uncurved railway track is not the only record they
boast of for the Nullarbor Plain (S. Aus.). In 1905,
at the commencement of the big drought of that
period, rabbits were coming down in millions from
the Outback country to the coastal areas of the
plain, where there was at least some water, though,
as usual in such localities, religiously guarded. Five
blacks asserted their ingenuity, and in five days
killed and skinned no less than 13,000 bunnies.
Their plan was to open one or two small holes into
the water enclosures, and, so soon as the famished
WORSE STILL.

"Garn, wot about yours! ’E’s got Blud'n'

pest had filled up the improvised drafting yard, to
get to work with waddies. Eyewitnesses state that
it was a common sight to see rabbits, just bereft of
their skins, run away a few yards before giving up
tiie ghost, in such matter-of-fact manner did the
niggers work.
THE SCOFFERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the time of the golden wattle,
As I came riding through,
Sweet Mary sang in the morning,
And the Maggies were singing, too.
It is I that have the music
And the voice, that chimes again,
Though all of the men be jealous,
And the maids be like the men.
Sweet Mary sang in the bushes,
And the Maggies sang in the shade,
And ’twixt Them there in the dewtime
’Twas the wonderful song they made.
And so in the morning gladness,
A young man, big and bold,
I joined in the singing chorus
With a voice that was rich as gold.
Three Jackies came from the distance,
And oh, but they looked so wise!
Three feathered imps of the devil,
With the mischief in their eyes.
I sat with my arms akimbo,
My voice like a chiming bell,
Though Mary gave over her singing,
And the Maggies they stopped as well.
And merry of heart in the morning,
1 sang, though, in truth, I knew
Sweet Mary was laughing and laughing,
And the Jackies were laughing, too.

“Silas Snell”: The waiter was not com-
plaining ; but obviously he thought I ought
to know. “Yes, sir, a waiter has a deal to
put up with. People regard us as if we
was somethin’ a little different, somethin’
not quite, as it were. There was those sol-
diers I mentioned, for instance. Two of
them were all right almost, but the third,
the’ little, stocky feller, he had a bloodshot
eye and a way of looking at things. He had
been to the war for several years, and he
had had nothin’ to eat —nothin’ worth while,
that is. lie was makin’ up for it. He ate
everythin’, he drank everythin’, and after the
fifth course he says, all of a sudden, his
bloodshot eye on me, ‘Do we eat the waiter?’
The others, being very drunk, told him most
soberly, pronouncin’ their English very care-
ful, that the waiter was not to be ate. ‘Why
not?’ says the little feller with the bloodshot
eye. ‘Why not eat the waiter? There’s not
enough of anything else. There can’t pos-
sibly be enough of everything else. I sug-
gest we eat the waiter. Now, how?’ says
he. ‘How,’ he says, ‘do you prefer your
waiter —-stewed or on the arf shell?’ The
other gentlemen said lie really mustn’t think
of it. One, I remember, said : ‘lt’s never
done now, Billy. Since the war no one eats
the waiter.’ ‘Why?’ says the little feller.
‘Underbred,’ whispered the tall officer.
‘Righto!’ says the little feller, and he was
most sincere, ‘we’ll make a san’wich of him.
Everythin’ else is ate,’ says he, ‘now clean
up the waiter.’ Well, he kep’ at it about
entin’ the waiter, and when they was leavin’
without havin’ ate me, he was most dis-
gusted. When it came to takin’ up a shillin’
a head for my tip the little feller with the
bloodshot eye burst out again. He flung his
overcoat on the floor. ‘There you are,’ he
says, ‘what’id I tell you? A shillin’ for the
waiter! You gutter pay for the blighter
whether you eat him or not.’ They pulled
him away to wash his han’s, ’n' I forgot all
about him till about fi’ minutes later, when
all of a sudden somethin’ crawled from under
a table and bit me most dreadful on the
leg. It was the little feller with the blood-
shot eye, and says he : ‘So help me,’ he says,
‘l’m goin’ to have my bob’s worth, anyhow !’ ”

“Trans-Australian” : I am wakened by
“Ouyen’s” shout that “at last the country
has got its travelling bank” (B. 15/11/ IT).
For the last four years the East-West Rail-
way has had one; at my end it covers 500-
odd miles. We also have a travelling
fruiterer; greengrocer, store, baker and
butcher. When the butcher runs out of
mutton he does his own killing on the train
(called “the Tea and Sugar”), as there
is always a truck of live jumbucks. Also,
in the event of anybody misbehaving, there
is a Jay Pay to administer justice, and a
John Hop to see that the penalty is carried
out before he moves on to the next camp.
"The lumpers on the Port Adelaide wharves
are taking steps to convince the local Cham-
ber of Commerce that the charges of pilfer-
ing ships’ cargoes ought to be sent to another
address. Two recent cases are mentioned:
in one, £4O worth of leather goods having
been abstracted, some bricks stamped with
their New York maker’s name were substi-
tuted ; in the other, £350 worth of rubber
tyres having been stolen, big cubes of stone
carefully packed took their place. The stone
is said to be as clearly American in origin
as the bricks, and the inference is that any-
thing beyond mere petty pilfering is done on
the other side of the ocean.

“Joyce”: The shortage of silver in parts
of Asia is very acute. The dollar, which is
the standard of the currency, was in October
worth 3s. 4d., whereas a few years ago it was
worth as little as Is. 7d. In other words,
our merchants have lately had to give for
a golden sovereign only about six dollars;
whereas a few years ago they had to give
more than 12. Which means that they can
buy in gold-using countries as much for £1
as'they could a while ago buy for £2. The
local tradespeople rub noses, however, and
to a great extent maintain old prices, with
the result that the public is exploited mag-
nificently. The scarcity of silver has be-
come so marked in the Straits Settlements
that the Government has issued a paper
currency for 10 cents, which is equivalent to
2.-8 pence in English money, payable to
bearer on demand at Singapore. I don’t
know whether any other country to-day has
paper money in circulation of so low a
value, but this should constitute something
of a record. This “note” is made of fairly
stiff paper and is about the size of a theatre
ticket.
“Wesfy”: The hour was late and the com-
pany was well oiled. Suddenly a cold-sober
stranger arrived and seated himself. Oyster-
opulos rushed to get his order and then flew
to the shoot. “Eggs fresh —for a police-
man !” he whispered hoarsely.

“D.F.”: The Yic. Forestry Department
has curious ideas. If it wants to plant soft
woods it persists in going nap on pinus
insignis for all sorts of places. The pinus
irisignis gives a timber which is fit only for
fruit-boxes, and it will grow anywhere, so
that it seems only reasonable to plant it
where other soft woods won’t grow and keep
the suitable places for something else. In
the higher parts of the north-east, for in-
stance," larches, firs and spruce will grow
like debts if they are only given half a
chance. And what’s wrong with giving the
native Murray pine a look-in at times?

“J.F.IL”: Latest London novels, still priced
at 65., are using paper which would have
been rejected for sixpenny reprints three
years ago. Publisher John Lane inserts a
note in NY. J. Locke’s new novel. "The Bed
Planet,” apologising for the quality. He
says it is the only kind procurable, and. had
as it is, cost him 150 per cent, more than
the far-better paper on which his novels
have hitherto been printed. And the price
is still mounting, while, to add ,to the
importer’s troubles, exchanges to Norway
and Sweden have been going sky-high. It
is actually at this moment costing the Eng-
lish importer £l2O to pay the Scandinavian
paper-miller £lOO, irrespective of freight and
insurance.
The pub at the old goldfields town of
Berringa (Yic.) has just been delicensed.
Yet there was a time when old Tom Farrell,
the licensee, reckoned that, though the bar-
counter was the longest in Australia, it
was none too long, and he’d taken over
£lOO a night across it. /
“Condenser”: I disagree with both
“Globe” and “N.K.” as to the Perth wire-
less station being badly placed. From solid
experience I can say that Perth’s Signals
are audible to ships coming down from the
equator long before Geraldton’s can be
heard. Certainly Esperance is not too well
placed and could be moved further eastward
with advantage, particularly for daylight
working: but Perth, on the standard wave
length, is one of the best working stations
in the world. I have with li-k.w. (plain
gap) gear cleared traffic to him at over 2240
miles, through fairly strong static at that.
Mount Gambier station is quite unnecessary,
but it is ridiculous of “N.K.” to say that
“right across the Bight ships are out of
call.” Perhaps “N.K.” uses the magnetic
detector. Give me.a good piece of West-
ralian galena, and I will guarantee to
exchange traffic in daylight with either
Adelaide or Esperance all the way across
the Bight. I’ve done it.
An out-of-the-way little industry has been
rubbing along for 40 years at Southport
(Tas.). It is the collection of little “whelk”
Shells, used for making necklaces which find
a market in America as well as locally. There
used to be money, too, in the trigonia shells,
made into hatpins and such things; but the
market is more limited and the supply isn’t
regular.
“Spud”: I halt my camel near Gaza to
give three cheers for Australian clothes and
tucker. (Don’t misunderstand me: I am
doing' the cheering, not the camel.) We’ro
proud of our Australian uniforms and get
a generous outfit when we leave home; but
that doesn’t last for ever. When our trous-
seau is worn out, no Australian issue is
available and we are disguised as Tommies
Objecting to this some of the boys hang on
to their original issue till they are almosi
in rags, or else buy a tailor-made “Wazza”
tunic when on leave. Our latest reinforce-
ments always come to us brand-new and
make us feel very threadbare. Why can’t
Australia keep on clothing us? As for our
country’s canned products, we have bought
and eaten tinned tucker from every nation
and are all firmly convinced that for quality
and flavor not one foreign brand can hold ii
soldering-iron to the Australian preserved
products, especially meats and fruits, lhit
we can seldom procure them. The War
Chest and the Y.R.C., with their numerous
and generous gifts, have done mucli
to advertise Australian goods amongst
the fighting Australians. I don’t think any
of us will look for “imported” on labels
when we return. It’s done most of us good
to travel and find out what grand things
Australia can produce.
“M'cNorth” : Let me nominate the coastal
she-oak (one of the casuarinas) for making
chisel-handles, mauls and other implements
that require a wood hard to split. Under
repeated hammering it will only “burr.”
Many of the beaches of the Far North are
fringed with she-oaks which supply black
brother with abundant .material for making
first-class woomeras (spear-throwing sticks),
spears and clubs. But you want plenty of
patience to cut the timber; its excessive
hardness will take the temper out of your
axe, and you, too, if you’re not a descendant
of Job.
THE PLAINT OF THE PLAIN BLOKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
She-looked at me and smiled on me
A luscious smile, both red and wide ;
And, as she beamed, quite suddenly
My heart swelled up with joy and pride
She gazed at me as ono who sees
A pleasant sight. Her lips beguiled
Me with a gentle, “Button, please?”
I parted—and again she smiled.
I passed her later in the day,
And once again she looked at me
In quite an earnest sort of way ;
Then turned aside indifferently.
No more on me her radiance shone ;
She coldly turned me down—-to try
Hoi' flashing, brilliant smile upon
A far, far plainer cove than I.
I am a loyal sort of bloke ;
I like to help a noble cause.
Like many other simple folk
Before a smile I gladly pause
To spend a bob ; yet, once it’s gone,
It’s gone. I always find that when
I put their bally button on
They never smile at me again.
VICTORIA,
O. L.
NERVES AND THE MORNING MILK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All the milk-carts in this world
(Seems sometimes there more are!)
Down our street each morn are hurled
Long ere comes Aurora.
I'm awakened by the din,
Bound about 5 a.m.,
And those milkmen-—where’s the sin?—
Gladly I could slay-’em!
Rattle, clatter, clash! they come,
In uncounted numbers ;
Causing pandemonium—-
He is dead that slumbers.
Howls of pain to Heaven ascend—
“ Milk-o’s,” dog-like, hellish!
Howls of passion with them blend,
And the morn embellish.
Curse the fluid of the cow!
Curse all those who sell it!
Curse the matutinal row !
Curse those who don’t quell it 1
Other items should be cursed—
Pardon, if I’ve missed ’em!
Here’s the last which should be first—
Curse my nervous system!
VICTORIA.

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

POLITICAL
POINTS
In their first real fight for life have Aus-
tralians in the hour of darkest trial washed
their hands of their army? The Bulletin
will not believe it. It prefers to think that
UNIMPORTANT.
“Surely, Miss Jones, you remember me!
Why, I proposed to you when we were
holidaying here last year.”
“No-o-o! How stupid of me! Can't you
recail some other incident—something I
could remember it by?”
they wanted to rid themselves of a vitupera-
tive little person who has got himself uni-
versally disliked. Two months ago The
Bulletin warned the Conscription party of
what was coming. It declared that you
could hardly carry Free Beer if it was a
condition that Hughes should serve it. The
vote, as far as the count has gone, proves
that. Which gives this paper hope that
there is something better in store when the
incubus has been got rid of.
The Antis protested that they were not
in the pay of the Kaiser. The unions should
inquire into this breach of Labor principles.
Why should any man work for the Kaiser
for nothing :
American visitor Trueblood, who pro-
fesses oratory at Michigan University, says
it is a delight to hear Australians utter the
long “u.” But that’s nothing. He should
see us utter the long lOU.
The truth is that the Commonwealth Par-
liament has paralysed itself, and until it
gets hold of at least some of the vanished
authority it will look more like a collection
of Bolsheviks than anything else on earth.
Many a good Conscriptionist did some hard
thinking last week. The thing that Aus-
tralia voted on was, of course, only a poor
apology for Conscription. But Hughes pro-
mised, or threatened —it depends upon the
point of view—the real thing if Yes wasn’t
carried. Wherefore many a good Conscrip-
tionist argued with himself that the only way
to get the real thing was to vote down the
other thing. There was logic in it; the prac-
tical drawback was that Hughes isn't omni-
potent.
AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT.
STUART: “If you're goin' home, you better
call your dog.”
ELIZABETH: “ Would you mind doing it?
I’m not speaking to him since he tried
to break my doll.”
And nobody invited Rivett, the pacifist
parson, to preach a sermon, dearly beloved,
from the Book of Nehemiah, iv. 14
Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible,
and fight for your brethren, your sons and your
daughters, your wives and your houses.
A bigger ass than usual is the Yic. Thistle
Act. Under this law Local Authority can
enforce the destruction of thistles by land-
owners with not enough brains to do it will-
ingly. But there are among old
subdivisions hundreds of allotments
for which owners can’t be found.
Local Authority itself can cut
thistles on private land, but only
under an order of a court of petty
sessions. Petty Sessions can only
make an order upon a show-cause
summons being served on the
owner. Obviously where no owner
can be found, no order can be
made. Commonsense would say
that Local Authority should enter
and cut the thistles in the public
interest. But this another ass-law,
the Local Government Act, forbids
as an “illegal expense.” So the
mad situation arises of thistles
being religiously cut on some land,
while scattered through it are little
patches that are a mass of the
curse, sending their seed far
around. A shire councillor re-
cently had a brain spasm and sug-
gested trying to get the Thistle Act
amended, but the shire secretary
said that’d take two years at least, so it was
decided to let things rip, as they had ripped
for 60 years.
One of the humorous features of the Anti
campaign as conducted by the so-called
Labor leaders was the vigor with which thev
insisted upon free speech. Those who have
had intimate relations with the Censorship
know that never in the whole course of the
war was the freedom of the press so re-
stricted as during the reign of the Labor
Government. There was nothing that was
not liable to be censored on the ground that
it was “prejudicial to recruiting." Among
the Ministers then and now was one whom
the Labor Opposition to-day cannot men-
tion without declaring that he is almost tne
last word in incompetence. Yet when the
Labor party was in power this paper was
prevented from applying to him the very mild
adjective “drifting.” And Arcnoishop
Mannix may be astonished to know that
some verses by a fervent Irish patriot were
deleted by a Censor acting under in-
structions, of a Labor Government. Even
a cartoon, pillorying the profiteer, was con-
demned as "prejudicial to recruiting,” and
Tiie Bulletin was warned lay the agent of
the Labor Government that if such a crime
was again committed the publisher would
be severely dealt with.
The time has come to seriously consider
Bigjohu Forrest. lie is past 70 now, and if
he were in charge of the Bank of Australasia,
for instance, he would have been farewelled
more than five years ago. Many a man, no
doubt, has at 70 .as clear a head as ever he
had and almost as sound a body; but the
Treasurer hasn't the sound body, and the
head that guided exploring parties never was
the head of a financier. If ever a depart-
ment needed a vigorous administrator, with
plenty of initiative, the Treasury wants it
now; and. grateful though Australia is for
the old warrior’s services, the time has come
—it came a good while ago, in fact —to say
that the Treasury can’t have what it needs
while John Forrest is in command.
The Kaiser wasn’t the first to show Aus-
tralia what she could do for herself if the
foreign competitor was blocked. Napoleon
was the first great patron of her industries.
In his "Statistical Account of the Settle-
ments in Australasia,” published in 1824,
Wentworth, writing as a ferocious Free-
trader, sorrowfully remarked :
The progress which this Colony has made in manu-
factures lias, perhaps, never been equalled by any
community of so recent an origin.... The origin of
this unnatural and unprecedented progress in manu-
factures may be traced to the scanty and precarious
market which existed in the Colony for agricultural
produce previously to the close of the last war.
The supply of corn and home produce exceed-
ing the home demand after ISO 4. people in-
vested money in other lines of business. By
the close of the Napoleonic wars some of
these industries, owing largely to the protec-
tion afforded by the high cost of freight and
insurance, "had taken pretty firm root.” But
Australia was blind to the hint, and the next
great war found her still without a decent
tariff, and still dependent, therefore, on the
foreigner.
Labor in Vic. is trying to dance itself
back to solvency. Attention has been drawn
to the fact by recruiting-officers who have
lately been refused permission to address
"socials” where swarms of hefty young
fellows were gathered together to waltz
funds into union coffers. Those who
keep their feet warm by crawling through
the mazy alberts are not opposed to volun-
taryism. They prefer it. It is, in fact, one
of the great principles of their lives. But
that doesn't stop them getting off a lot
of nasty language to the recruiting-officer
when he invites them to put their great
guiding principle into practice.
Victorian Governor Stanley, seeking to find
an excuse for his existence, told a Warragul
audience:—
After all, a Governor is a sort of ambassador to
the State, and he should bring first-hand knowledge
from the old country to the new.
Then it is at least reasonable to insist that
candidates sit for an examination before they
get the job.
WHEN THE TIME TIM WAS RIPE.
HE: "Hurry up! The motor's been honking
for half an hour—the whole street is
out.”
SHE: “Well, then, I'm coming now.”
From a Melbourne industrial suburb:—
In this fourth year of war there are at least signs
of a stirring towards national self-reliance. Within
the last few weeks half a dozen applications for
research “factory” Registrations have come within
my purview. Most of the experimenters were n *
tern-making patterns for little metal e( w] s m
gas-fittings and other brassware, spoutine- l a

etc., that have heretofore been commercially im’

little business going in piano sconces and motor
wind-screen hinges. Another firm was on metal
buttons and those little hooks that are the topmost
fastening on men s pants. This experimenter was
disheartened : the others, however, told me there
were firms ready to make up their castings at pay-
able rates, and that the war was holding out possi-
bilities of success. But not one of them was. trying
to do anything big on account of the uncertainty of
the post-war tariff. One little lot of experimenters
in their application (the presence of any machine
makes a fowl-house or tool-shed a factory within
the meaning of some Act) mentioned that they were
at work all day, and proposed to do their indus-
trial research in their spare time. A P.L.C.-ridden
municipal council turned down their application
under the sacred one-man-one-job rule! An interest-
ing feature of all the applications was that in ererii
case the applicant was a “pommy”—not immedi-
ately immigrant, but immigrant within the last five
years, and still retaining the burrs of speech. That
is a very serious matter. Does the native prefer the
imported thing? Or is it that he knows what a
horrible struggle most manufacturers have had under
the always uncertain and generally low tariffs of the
past, so that now it doesn’t occur to him to use
his brains in thinking out things and his labor and
skill in founding new industries? There is some-
thing wrong, anyhow.

That young dragoon, with ready sword, who came
From France to aid the cause of liberty,
Made of his gallant blade a very flame
To light the path of wofld-wide chivalry;
He left his bride with tearful, pleading eyes,
Laughed at his King, and joined the high emprise.
Men set the silver tankard on the board,
And cried him fool who dared so much, to win
\\ hat peasant lifts a pike for, with his sword,
W hose veins ran noble blood, whose haughty kin
W ould cast him off, as one who rabble leads—
“ Not for the common herd a Marquis bleeds!”
The boat has slipped her moorings ; tost and torn
By many contrary winds, she yet speeds on
Until upon a thrice-approved morn
Voung Lafayette has met with Washington;
W bile, down the clouded years, old beacons shine
Recalling that first fight at Brandywine!
The days are gone of gorgeous gentlemen
With cobweb ruffles made of Brussels lace;
But France's daughters weep to-day, as when
Tears for a bridegroom stained a lovely face,
And her fine brows against the pane were set
k or one last tender look at Lafayette 1
America has wept for France's tears
And like a phantom from that buried day
She sees the young dragoon of storied years
Leap from the wooden barque that rides the bay;
And Stars and Stripes for France's shores are set —

NOTIONS
Ihe A.J.C. Summer meeting opened a
Hand wick on Saturday with an extended men
seven events being- listed. The totalisator w
working in the paddock and leger and on the fla
and the meeting also had the assistance of the usua
hundred Bags. The machines were worked on
basis of 10s. inside and ss. outside. They got i
more than a fag-end of the business. Th
amount handled at all three machines in cl
Villiers was only £3858, and on the Grandstai
Handicap £1904.
In the Villiers Stakes the calamity which usual!
waits on backers of the favorite in that event wa
doing business as usual. The regularity with whic
the best-backed nag in the Villiers fails to even ru
into a place is one of the brightest incidents in th
history of Israel. It is a race that has fallen man;
times to roaring outsiders—rarely to a really wel
backed customer. The explanation is, of course, tha
the Villiers is run at a season of the year whe
horses that had been coming on in the Spring ar
either being spelled or going off, and others o
which little is known are getting into form. Thi
year Mehi King was solidly backed when the weight
appeared, and, in spite of a subsequent unpromis
ing display at Rosehill, money was pushed in o
him right up to the death. On the King’s best pei
formances, such as his run in the last Epsom ant
a win at Rand wick with 9st. 101 b. aboard at Tatt.’
meeting in September, he seemed a possible gooc
thing. On some of his other deeds it looked wise t
select something else. But in consequence of recen
track work there was also much preliminary backing
for Sobrina, Cetigne, Promised Land, Wedding Day
and Norbury. It was Cetigne who capsized th
favorite, with last year’s winner, Wedding Day, nex
and the frequently-surprising Merrimee third.
Cetigne, one of the best middle-distance
horses racing in Australia, is now five years old and
owns a record which might have been still bettei
with a little extra luck. At two years he hac
three wins and two seconds, and three times ran ou
of place. In the following year he was only twice
unplaced in 15 starts—got six wins and sevei
seconds. At four years he won but once, was foui
times in a place and five times not noticed. Then
he was sold for £l5OO and was well worth the
money. He has won three times since and re-
turned the new owner all he parted with and a
bit over. _ Always a brilliant miler, Cetigne
had sometimes shown an indisposition to hop oft
the mark quickly. But what he could do at the
business end of the distance was not in much doubt
when, with 9st. 31b. on top, he buried Wedge in
the Spring Stakes at the Rosehill September meet-
ing in “38.” On Saturday he carried 9st. 21b.,
started at B’s and, making a wonderful run from
the top of the straight, ended up in “381,” with
two lengths to spare.
Last year’s winner of the Villiers, Wedding Day,
made a gallant effort to get away with the cash
again. It was not until near the distance that she
got a clear run; then shakine- off Merrimee and Some
Boy, she looked momentarily a sure winner—until
Cetigne was noticed coming up with every stride.
He just caught the brilliant chestnut in the last
bit. It was lucky for Wood, on the winner, that
Connell had not been able to make an earlier start.
Mehi King was the seventh consecutive favorite
for the Villiers Stakes to miss a place in the race.
He rounded the incident off by being the seventh to
arrive at the post after a bad passage. For a time
on the course Promised Land was at a shorter price,
but eventually drifted away to 10’s. He finished
sixth. He had every chance so far as position went
in the earlier stages of the trip.
Newcastle, which is addicted to sending nags
down to Randwiek to unobtrusively appropriate the
proceeds at bargain prices. N did it again on Satur-
day. When the field for the Nursery Handicap was
being saddled, most people were inspecting Woorawa,
a handsome, promising colt who ran second in the
Breeders’ Plate, or gazing hopefully at Sunnvside and
Lingle’s sister, Pamphlet, and Shell Shock' and Sir
Hugo. When the race was finishing they hurriedly
became aware that something named Aranap was in
it. Subsequently they discovered that the aforesaid
juvenile had shown Woorawa the way to the line,
and that Ike was paying Newcastle 25’s for doing
it. Aranap is of the Linacre family, a sister to Pan-
acre, and was making a second visit to the course.
On the first occasion she was a starter in the Gim-
crack, won by Sweet Lady, but wasn’t sighted on the
way. A couple of weeks ago she started at 6 to 4
in a race at Newcastle, and ran second. Aranao
was bracketed on the totalisator with Salary, a
youngster inhabiting the same stable, and the ring
betting indicated that Salary was the more highly
thought of.
The Pistol gelding Greek Fire showed what sort
of performer he is over hurdles in June by winning
the jumping double at Randwiek without excessive
effort. On Saturday he showed what he can do in
December and, incidentally, notified that the trouble
which overwhelmed him while he was getting ready
for the Grand National at Melbourne during the
winter had disappeared. Ridden by Maxwell 1m
carried 12st. 51b., which included a lot of lead, and
did all that was wanted at 2 to 1. He won bv
nearly 50yds.
* * * *
The problem of whether Amberdown’s
nomination was in order for the Albion Park (Bris-
bane) Five Hundred, won by the colt on August 13,
has been settled bv the appeal against this win
being upheld. The ground of the appeal was that
Ainberdown was not registered at the time of run-
ning, as required by the rules. The prize-money,
therefore, goes to Barley Bree. Prior to winning
at Albion Park the horse scored several other races,
and the question whether the stakes can be recov-
ered at law is understood to be engaging the earnest
attention of Costs. Meanwhile argument about bets
on these various races rages with great fury. It also
happens that, prior to being scratched for the
last Epsom, Amberdown was backed for that event,
and ever since there has been disputation between
Ike and the punters as to which of them is en-
titled to the money wagered. If Amberdown’s
nomination had a hole in it, then he was not entitled
to annex the Epsom, and backers had no chance of
winning. As he was apparently ineligible for
Randwick, it seems as if the punter’s protest against
being made a loser has been sounder than Ike’s
anxiety to make a profit.

A lot of people have been guessing lately
how much a stallion with a reputation would fetch
just now, and as two such nags are to be
put under the hammer during the next fortnight,
the guessers have not long to wait for an answer.
The two are Tressady, of the Brown stud, and Sol
Green’s Comedy King. The lift given to Green’s
horse by Biplane has been considerable, and there
are many people who reckon he will realise the
bigger sum. It may turn out so; but Tressady is
a remarkably fine animal and quickly made a name
for himself. The most interesting point about the
sale of these horses, though, will be the light shed
on the estimate breeders have of the future value
of yearlings and of racing generally. The habit
of paying high prices for young stock is certainly
declining, not without good reason. Of course
the money to be won by a first-class horse will in
all likelihood continue to be such as to make
original cost of very little importance. But the
question of real importance is whether there is any
probability of racing being continued on such lines
as to cause keen demand for anything with breed-
ing and four legs. This page is fairly positiv
that there is little likelihod of it, and that the time
when Australians provided for themselves mor
racing than any other people on earth are beginning
to pass. On the whole, there will be nothing
this to be sorry for.
Wallace, most famous son of Carbine, hac

A great racehorse and a great sire. He won many
notable races at Randwick, Caulfield and Flemington
and begat such nags as Emir, Trafalgar, Patrobas
Kingsburgh, Mountain King, Lady Wallace, Wolaw;
and Amata. The famous mare Cruciform went to
Wallace several times, but the partnership was
disappointment. The old horse was bred by W. R
Wilson. At the sale of Wilson’s stud he was bough ;
by J. V. Smith for 750 guineas and went to Bun
doora Park (Vic.). Up to the end of last racing
season his family had won 761 races and gatherec
in £213,500 in stakes.

There are good judges in Maoriland who
-believe, or at any rate say they believe, that the cob:
Ilymestra, lately sold for a hatful at the break-up of
the Ormond stud, is better than Biplane. There are
others who hold that he would beat Desert Gold ovei
a middle distance. Still this writer would be sur-
prised if there is anything in Maoriland to beat
Biplane at w.f.a. over a mile or 10 furlongs. That
there are two nags that could do it is incredible.
Apart from one shocking exhibition, Biplane gal-
loped in Australia like the champion that only
arrives on the scene now and again. But it is not
certain what he would look like in a first-class Derby
field. Australian experience of him gives no line on
that—except to this extent, that there was nothing
here to run him down or go anywhere near it.
The haughty boarders of a St. Ivilda (Vic.)
hash-foundry had the unprecedented weariness of
foraging for their tucker the other morning. It
seems that the chef and the duchesses who usually
waited at table had departed hurriedly at something
a.m. without giving notice of the evacuation. The
whole house rocked with inquiries, but it was not
until the end of a frantic day that the landladv
heard that her staff had vanished to cash a first
prize which they had caught in Tatt.’s.
Forecasted that one of the things certain
to happen soon after peace is a fly from England to
Australia. The thing seems easilv within the
bounds of probability, for by taking' a roundabout
trip there would be a dry place to fall on most of
the way, and the stages could be easily regulated
so as not to get beyond reach of oil and repairs.
The estimates of the necessary time hover round
nine days. The weakness is that, while it is
known that a man can ride an aeroplane at full
speed for a dozen hours or so, it is not known what
he would be feeling like if he had to ride for 20
hours daily for more than a week. It would cer-
tainly be a tremendous trial of endurance and nerve
stability. The idea that mails betwen Svdney and
London will be per air before the kids are much older
seems a bit over the odds until a new race of post-
men has been raised.

Ilex Norman, the best of the left-handers
in Sydney cricket this season, is a good all-round
sport. He has already taken 30 wickets averaging
14.56 for Glebe, a return to the form he showed in
1915-16, when he topped Glebe’s club list with 50
wickets averaging 15.50. Norman’s eight for 31
against Petersham was next to Jack Scott’s nine for
32, the best effort in that season’s premiership
matches. In colder months Rex Norman kicks for
S. Sydney in League football, while brother Ray does
similar things for Eastern Suburbs.
Dave McAllister, a N. S. Wales champion
rifleshot, has been killed in France. He won the
King’s Prize in 1913 and was sixth in the same event
in the previous year. In 1912 he represented N. S.
Wales in the Commonwealth matches in Tasmania
and in Brisbane the next year. In 1914 he was at
Bisley, and came away laden. He leaves old club-
mates at Harden, Goulburn, Gundagai and Junee.

Tasmania has a few “firsts’ 1 in cricket.
The Speck defeated Victoria by three wickets in
the first “intercolonial" at Launceston on February
11, 1851. Charlie Eady’s 566 at Hobart in 1902 is
the heaviest biff with the bat registered in Aus-
tralia. Also Tasmania fell for the lowest inter-
colonial score (18) against Victoria in ’69. The
sheaf of records against Tasmania includes the first
century in inter-State cricket, made by Jim Phillips
(Vic.) in ’69; while G. Elliott’s (Vic.) nine for
two in ’58 and Sam Cosstick’s (Vic.) six for one
are the best intercolonial averages, and both were
inflicted on the little Island. Possibly because Tassy
doesn’t arise and awake, the Australian Board of
Control refuses to give it any Sheffield Shield
matches.

J. Gray, of Sydenham (M.L.), who at
Christchurch recently smote 343 of a total of 597
for four wickets against Christ’s College, put a new
grade record on the slate. H. B. Lusk’s 334 for
West Christchurch in 1914-’15 was the previous best.
Gray’s figures, however, do not wreck the M.L. record
of 354 perpetrated by J. N. Crawford, one time of
Adelaide.

When Keith Kirkland cleaned up the slate
at N.S.W. High School swimming championships
recently, the lad on his heels was S. Willsher, of
Sydney High School. Young Willsher foolishly set
out to pick up the programme, and finished second
in the 50yds., 100yds., 220yds., and third in the
440yds., 880yds. and diving. Every youngster badly
needs a solemn warning against cultivating such ah
appetite. In club matches Willsher decorates the
scratch-mark, and the other day won a 68$yds.
handicap in 38sec. With a couple of years added
to his 16, he is likely to be one of the State’s best.
“Murkah” : Re time diving (B. 6/12/T7).
This seems to be a test where poor physical condition
is an asset. When I was the round-shouldered owner
of a 33in. chest with a half-inch or so expansion, I
was locally invincible at this submarine foolishness.
In contests on the Goulburn River (Vic.) and in
Stubb s Baths, South Melbourne, I was never ex-
tended. The reason, as a doctor explained it to me,
was low vitality—that, though I had no capacity for
air, on account of my general miserableness I didn’t
require much. He also promised me faithfully that
if I didn’t change my job (telegraph-operating) I
would end up with consumption. 1 swapped the tele-
graphing for five years in the bush. There, with the
development of a 38in. barrel, I lost most of my
ability at the diving business. “Tam O’Shanter’s"
friend’s 3imin. performance with only a 36in. chest
would seem to indicate something of the same nature.

N.S.W. Education Department arranged
last week to have 5090 children schooled in swim-
ming. Weather conditions were favorable to the
venture, and made a wholly enjoyable outing for
the scholars and 60 teachers. Fifteen enclosures about
Sydney were commandeered for the biggest scheme of
the sort yet launched in Australia. In charge of the
proceedings were two of Australia’s best-known enthu-
siasts—Walter E. Betbel and Miss Ella Gormley.
Bethel, a sprite of 54, has been pushing amateur
swimming for about a third of a century, and is
remembered as one of the few who stuck to Barnev
Kieran when that great youngster was seeking world’s
championships. When not in bathing costume, Bethel
is chief clerk in the Education Department. Miss
Gormley’s job is to put 4000 children a week through
the water and teach each one how to kick. A great
scheme and well worth while.

Jess Willard’s proclamation that he is
willing to defend the heavy-weight championship
against anyone on earth, provided the whole of the
cash on the premises goes to the Red Cross, sounds
as if the vast cowboy was more anxious to keep the
advertising department supplied than provoke attack.
Since tearing the halo from the murky brow of
Brother Johnson, the big chap has had' one fight
and annexed a fortune by exhibiting himself. Per-
haps the last thing in the world he wants is another
disturbance. Anyway, the invitation to engage in
biff for nix is not likely to create much enthusiasm
just now among American pugs, for the money is
evaporating out of the profession as quickly as the
beer out of a dry State.

At last the N. S. Wales Fisheries Depart-
ment sa\s it has awakened to the need of dropping
the heaviest axe into the neck of the people who are
spoiling both sport and industry by lifting undersized
fish and by illegal netting and dvnamiting. The
Department threatens all sorts of' dire penalties;
but under the present system of inspection there’s
not much for the sinners to fear. Writer has fished

“Wal”: The statement that the Pamum
use the web of a spider for making fishing-nets
“ rre v ct : Jhe spider lives in the Owen Stanley an
Mt. V ule Ranges, which form the roof of West-Oenh-
Papua, and its services are requisitioned bv th
natives who dwell on the banks of the St Wn
Biaru, Williams, Tauri and Vailala rivers wh F
flow from these highlands. The ingenious brow
Highlander makes a hoop of rattan-cane and ham*
it among a colony of the spiders, who quickly welf
their webs across the frame. In a few days bro«
brother wanders back and removes the net whittle
a handle from the scrub, and wades into the nearer
creek and dredges his dinner from the waters Th
web is very fine and strong; I have often lifted
two- or three-pounder from a rock-pool with one o
these nets. The spider that spins the web is
consider, a carnivorous insect, for I have often see
the remains of small birds in the webs in th
jungle. On one occasion I rescued a voung twelvi
wire Paradise bird from the attentions of two o
these enormous brutes, who had him securely meshei
and were about to call the children in to dinner.
“J.L.H.”: The platypus must be firs
cousin to the bulldog, if ability to scrap is anv indi
cation. The other night I was fishing in the' Sout
Esk (Tas.), and heard a tremendous splashing anc
churning in the water. I was quite at a loss t(
account for it at first. Closer investigation provet
it to be a couple of large-sized platypi engaged ii
an all-in mix-up. They floated down the stream
quite oblivious to surroundings, or the sticks anc
stones with which I pelted them; I even managed tc
get close enough to prod them with a pole, but they
refused to be separated, and after making the serai
hot and strong for about half an hour they sank
slowly beneath the surface, still locked in a deadh
grip.

“Geo. L. Hobson”: I think “Rio” (B.
22/11/’l7) is overshooting the mark a bit when he
says .303 military cartridges cost 255. per 100 to
produce. That is about the price a profit-grabbing
gunsmith will charge you for them. Before the war
the empty shells were worth about 7d. per lb. in
Sydney. Twelve months after the war started sd.
was all I could get for them. At the present time
you can buy 35 calibre automatic rifle cartridges
for 20s. per 100 in Sydney; they are nickel bullets
with a lead point, made in America, and Heaven
knows what percentage of profit the dealers make out
of them, but it must be considerable. I agree that
the waste of ammunition that goes on at Randwick
and other ranges is tremendous. Men shoot there
every Saturday year after year, and what for? As
a sport, no doubt, it is fascinating. Target-shooting
teaches a man to load and fire quickly; but it cannot
teach him to shoot accurately in the field. Once a
target-puncher gets off the grass mound and has to
shoot without his sling, he is all at sea. In the
field, with a military rifle, at unknown ranges, with-
out the use of a sling and the usual two sighting
shots, the best rifle-club man is simply lost by the
wallaby and kangaroo hunters, who use no artificial
aids.

“Billy T.” ; They were repairing the road
under my window, and using a long, heavy, wire-
covered hose which, when not in use, was rolled on
a large, spindle-like contrivance on two wheels.
This quaint vehicle was standing on the edge of the
footpath when Sylvester Well came up and collided
with it. In his sober moments my friend is an
excellent lawyer, but he has not been following the
King of late. When he bumped the hose-reel he
first apologised, hat in hand, and then manifested an
expert’s interest in the mechanism of the thing. He
looked the contrivance over carefully. He was pleased
with it, and, being pleased, decided to give it an
unprejudiced trial, with a view to purchase. He
passed one long leg over the drum, and —“Be seated,
gentlemen.” The drum revolved, and Well went
over to the left, and fell off into his hat. Now,
Well is not a man easily put down (morally),
especially when in drink. He arose with an air of
great determination, and mounted again. Again the
drum revolved, and again Sylvester fell off, once
more into his hat. His hat was ruined, his watch
was in the gutter, silver was scattered on the foot-
path ; but he was going to see this thing through.
He rushed the reel, literally flung himself at it, and
the drum, revolving rapidly, shot him along the side
walk. Hurrying to the rescue, I found him involved
with a corporation laborer. I extracted my friend.
He was damaged, but his composure was wonderful.
He gave half a crown to the laborer. “Now,” he
said, “since you're ho smart, show us how you do
ride the damn thing!”


Every Man and Women can
have PERFECT HEALTH!
No matter how much learning you may acquire, no matter
how you may develop your talents, no matter how much
money you may earn, if through ignorance of your own
body you suffer ill-health and die years before your time,
your education will have been a failure.”
Why be handicapped in life’s battle through ill-health?
Why suffer needless aches and pains?
Why allow yourself to become run-down, nervy, out-of-sorts,
and liable to contract the various complaints to which
mankind is subject?
Why not become a strong, vigorous and perfectly-healthy
being, as Nature intended you to be?
Regular and proper exercise such as I prescribe in my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture
will make you fit and keep you strong and healthy. Don’t
that your case is the exception—it’s not. You will
find my exercises both beneficial and enjoyable pastime,
tuu will look forward to the time when you have to do
them, and find the benefits very rapid.
The deep-breathing exercises included in my Course will
build up your chest, broaden your shoulders, strengthen your
lungs and make you breathe in a natural way.

Why take chances with an inflammable roof when we can
supply a roofing that insurance companies regard as “ equal
to tin, slate or tile” in fire-resisting qualities. This roofing is

COSTS MORE - WEARS LONGER
In a recent test “Piles of wood
shavings and sawdust, saturated
with gasoline, were burned for
19 minutes—until consumed —
on the surface of fSU'BER'OIQ
Roofing. At the end of this time
the embers were removed and it
was found that the roofing was
blistered but still intact.”
{tU-BER’OIO contains no coal tar,
asphaltum oils, wood fibre, paper,

The co. runs a cheap lodging-house on
sanitary principles; and probably because so
many young men have gone to the war, while
those who haven’t have been enjoying the
high wages that have been produced by war
expenditure, the takings have been steadily
shrinking—lols, £5722; 1916, £5397; 1917,
£5253. In the past year, moreover, there
have been exceptional payments for mainte-
nance (some of these might properly be
charged to capital account). Hence the
reduced net profits. However, the co. can’t
complain that the bread of its philanthropy
cast upon the waters hasn’t come back to it.

The capital at present consists of £64,270
in permanent £5 shares and £4670 in invest-
ing £2O shares; and the withdrawal of some
of the latter" capital explains the reduction
in dividend during the last couple of years.
The Langridge has one of the most honor-
able records among Melbourne financial insti-
tutions ; not only was no depositor ever
required to take less than 20s. in the £, even
after the general smash among building soci-
eties 24 years ago, but the present dividend
is on the original capital. Further, the soci-
ety is still run on lines which make deposits
absolutely secure. Look at this:—

Deduct liquid assets from the amount
owing by the society, and the remaining
liabilities are covered seven times over by
other assets. Certainly practically all those
other assets are advances; but as they have
been made under building-society tables,
which means a steady reduction of the
amount advanced and a consequent improve-
ment in the security, and as there are obvi-
ously few new advances, the risk is com-
paratively very small. It is a little remark-
able that the co. can pay an 8 p.c. div. so
comfortably in the circumstances. It says
a lot for the society’s management and its
goodwill. What there is in the years ahead
depends very, largely, not only upon the
rural industries, but upon the vigor with
which new industries are maintained and
established through an effective tariff. That
will do a lot to save the situation for these
building societies. If there isn't this indus-
trial activity, then there will be a slack time
for them, though there is pretty sure to be
use for their own free capital at good rates.

ond to few in Queensland or perhaps Aus-
tralia, got a good trial many years ago. It
runs for some five miles, and "has, I should
think, about 50 shafts on it. some down to
a depth of 80 feet; but none of them struck
payable ore, beyond a few tons of picked
stuff. About two years ago I was taken
on a wild-goose chase to that lode and gave
it a fair sampling, with a result that showed
it was valueless. Of course it would be
foolish .to say that nothing new will be
found in the Chillagoe district, but it’s a
safe bet that whatever is found won’t be
sticking up over the surface, and the pick-
and-shovel prospector has to get some
encouragement at the grass roots before he
takes on blind stabbing for lodes There
may be one reason for the purchase of the
railway, but it hasn’t been spoken of so far
and that is the connection with the Croydon
line. There are over 400.000 head of cattle
m and about the country that such a line
would run through, and it might mean a big
help to small holders to go in for cattle-rear
mg; besides which there is very good
land on the Gilbert suitable for agriculture
I>ut as for the district not being scratched,
there are the remains of too manv dead town-
ships too many rotten poppet-legs, too manv
abandoned shafts for anyone to take anv
serious notice of that statement, even though
it be made by the Treasurer of Queensland

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character') will he
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
F.T.W.: Much obliged, and same to you.
During the past three months the B.’s prose yarns
were written by 18 different people, of whom three
were new men—which, on the whole, isn’t a bad
proportion. We are looking for them all the time.
....Worker: Glad to be informed that The Bulle-
tin has fallen into the hands of the Ilughes-Cook
party. No doubt this accounts for the profound
respect it has been showing Hughes and Cook lately.
....Narked: Thanks: but the awful Meiklyjohn’s
“New Geography” (1910) has already hid attention.
Is it still in Australian use ? If so, where 1.... Murkah:
Right... .Ed. S.: Keep going. .. .R.R.: That dyna-
mite incident happened to you, did it? Methuselah,
it’s time that you were permanently dead... .Jack-
pot: Don’t know the contributor to the Adelong
Argus who signs himself “Jimmy Pannican.” Any-
way, he’s not “Jimmie Pannikin” —not by paddocks.
• N .. .C.H.S.: See recent back issues; fully explained
how to deal with the pest.... Tasman: This paper’s
thirst for paragraphs is never satisfied. But the
sample to hand seems to deal with a personal
grievance, and that’s not the sort we want....
Bellerive: That’s the way to deal with them: —
A ghastly pallor spread o’er the face
Of a treacherous spy of war,
Sentenced to be shot by a British squad
After a trial by court-martial law;
A gallant force the miscreant betrayed
To the staff of the crafty Huns,
Their position behind a sheltered hill
To their number of men and guns;
At the hour of sunrise in the woodland,
A volley of rifles did boom —-
Vengeance was wreaked on the traitor,
He’d met a justified doom.
. ...G.H.: Seemed to us that there was a lot in
the Defence Department’s contention that a soldier’s
military record gave no indication of what a man
was likely to do in civil employ. What’s the
answer to that, if there is one 1... . N.M.: Nothing
exciting about that... .P.F.H.: Have it your own
way; but it's a bumpy way over an intellectual
desert... .W.J.G.: No mirth in it,.. .H.8.J.: Poor,
unrhymed stuff which jars the ear all the way,
says only the old things badly, and can’t even keep
true to its own scansion. .. .D. 11.: Sorrowful frag-
ment. Can’t “Australia” rouse something better than
that?. .. .E.E.S.: The pathos of it moved the
Religious Editor to beers: —
I wandered on for miles and more,
And then I came to a cottage door.
And there before a dreary fire
A sad-faced woman wept.
I looked upon the sad, sad scene,
The saddest I had ever seen,
For was she not my own dear wife
Whom I had left in pain and strife?
Then as I silently upon her gazed,
She turned and looked up in amaze,
And with one low cry of pain,
She fell into my arms—for ever to remain.
.A.H.8.: You should be able to sell “Mistaken
Identity” elsewhere. Try.... Gadfly: Too stiffly con-
ventional. .. .F.C.8.: Doesn’t work.... South Afri-
can: Not much skill or thought... .G.N.C.: Might
make a song. No literary value.... Mick C.: Gram-
mar wild and verse bumpy. .. .W.R.M.: You mean
well. But poetry isn’t in your line... .M.C.H.:
Can’t observe any improvement in it... . J.A.F.:
Lamentable stuff. .. .E. 8.8.: Not nearly up....
A. :It reads like American vers libre. No use
to us... . J.11.R.: None up... .G.F.E.: “Feet of Clay”
misses... .J.McI.: People more than 14 years old
have written much worse things. Try again later.
. ...J.K.8.: N 0... IH.V.S.: None of them up....
P.D.: “Query” is poor and commonplace .A.R.S.:
Nothing in it. .. .C.G.C.: “Souvenir” sonnets are
good, but we don’t want them.... Lana: Not our
style. .. .C.A.M.: The dog is too thin... .A.8.C.:
“Ranks” won’t pass muster. .. .E.M.W.; “Paragon”
doesn’t quite score S.H.: No use L.T.G.: Full
of echoes. Can’t advise about a teacher... .F.M.S.:
Takes too long to come to the point; and the yarn
is not fresh... .R.M.: “Psyche” won’t do. Two lines
are bad. And the theme hardly suits us in any
case Nutty: A man who uses paper that size
would want all Australia for a blotting-pad. Mount
it on wheels the next time. (P.S. —Use pneumatic
tyres. With those bumps in the verse it wants
something to take off the jar.) W.C.H.: Very
lame. .. . M.S.: Don’t try the sonnet until you’ve
mastered other forms J.C.: “Haggis” is dull stuff.
. ...R.H.C.: That chopped prose is no u5e....0.8.:
The nut-cracker harmony produced by the rhyme-
arrangement gets us
Now Harry soon woke up to the fact,
Only to choose Annie to square the act;
So early one morn, so keen on the contract
To tell Annie’s father the whole solemn fax.
.. . . M.D.: “Beltshazar” might “in a measure” repre-
sent any old thing. It’s the measure, in two senses,
that damns it... .J.F.N. (or something) : No use.
....G.F.E.: No. ... Derrick: Verse too lumpy and
bumpy Cron: Not well enough done E.S.:
Not nearly up....C.T.: Hopeless in metre and
thought M.M.: “Expiation” fails. Don’t care for
the other T.E.D.: Too slight M.W.L.R.: It
wanted a musical choice of words to carry it....
B. : Easy verses with little skill and no lift.
TO ARTISTIC CAND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.R.: Good try W. Barry: Thanks, but it
arrives too late. .. .R.W.C.: Sorry unsuitable... .
A. 8.: Away with the zoo! A.E.S: Don’t want to
borrow. .. .P.H.C.: Idea isn’t worth while. .. .S.M.:
Must that poor old jest be dragged out of its retire-
ment again? H.S.: Heard the gag before. Hope
we never see the drawing again R.C.S.: Two
straight out of the timber-yard W. 8.: Nothing in
it.... Norman S.: Unreal people. The young man
should be drowned quickly.... Avon: Too late—too
angular—too everything F.W.W.: No, it’s worth
nothing. All depends on yourself; you start from
scratch A.N.: Economise in noses, study and
forego the chestnuts Bro: No, they are only
feeble and expressionless.
In a not very old Tasmanian pension-list
“Solomon Blay, public executioner,” is down
for £2O. Solomon Blay sent more men into
Eternity than did Botany Bay’s very own
“Nosey Bob,” whose record was 75, or there-
abouts.
“Jobber”: A cobber of mine blew into a
Dago fish-joint recently in the big smoke.
“ ’Ere. Tonio, one large plate steaka da oyst
y&t the blanky double.” Tonio recognised
his customer instantly. “Here, you, Aus-
tralia, you spealta da Eng.,”" he
answered, “or outa you go!”

After a Strenuous Day’s Work a Ration of
MEGGITT’S Linseed Meal
RESTORES and INVIGORATES.
It builds up tissue and is convertible into fat and heat. Maximum results are obtained at minimum cost by the use of
MEGGITT’S LINSEED OIL MEAL because it is all food and easily assimilated.
Analyses show that LINSEED OIL MEAL contains more protein than other food, which makes it especially invaluable to
draught horses. If you expect the best from your horses —give them the best food obtainable.
Mr. PETER L. TIGIIE, Ferodale, Raymond Terrace, says:—“You seldom, if ever, require medicine for your stock if
you use Linseed Oil Meal. If you want a clean skin and glossy coat on your horses give them Linseed Oil JVleal.”
HOW TO FEED MEGGITT’S LINSEED OIL MEAL TO HORSES.
Commence lightly, the Meal is very rich, and you must get your horse used to it. Small handful each feed for the
first week; after, increase to from 2 to 4 pounds per day, according to the work your horse is doing.

which stood in the neighborhood of Mar-

it did not count for much.
From a Bulletin Sundry-Show-man ;
I want to wish Florence Young a happy New
Year. One of my most vivid small-boy recollec-
tions is of watching poor Violet Varley’s flower-laden
hearse pass Melbourne Princess’s, where the little
actress had been idolised. Good-humored Florence,
belongs to that period ; yet here she is still leading
brilliantly, still whipping up a flagging stage, still
throwing her song-words to the remotest seats of
the biggest J.C.W. theatre! I heard her the other
night after I had been listening to a lot of other
people, and was startled by the bell-like purity of
her high notes, and the fact that you knew all the
time what she was singing about. In the midst of
much vocal fog an interpolated line froip Florence
comes across like a flash from an occulting light.
And she never makes faces while she is doing it.
Some singing actresses look as if they were about
to take a mouthful of spaghetti, or yell “Fire!” or
have a tooth out. This buxom Australian never does.
May her shadow never grow less —unless she wants
it to.

Charlie Tait, writing from California,
gives a new testimonial to our Allies :
I have found courtesy in every walk of life. This
has been most marked. Never once have 1 heard a
boorish word, nor noticed any incivility on tram,
train, street or caf£. Of course, one is always
spending money, but that happens to the traveller in
any country. Tipping runs to about 10 per cent, of
your bill. Soldiers! These surprised me. They are
a fine lot of boys, free from skite. They seem a
serious-minded lot of chaps—hold themselves like
men and act like men. If the rest of them are as
good as the Californians —-well, the Herr Gott Kaiser
will have cause to remember them.
“C. Ockney” : It seems strange nowadays
to come across the names of real live authors
on a pantomime bill, but the programme of
Drury Lane’s latest annual (“Aladdin”' in-
dicates a return to old conditions. The
writers are F. Anstey, Frank Dix and
Arthur Collins, the first-named being the
old-established Punch humorist, who in
addition has written many bright farces —
“Vice Versa’’ and “Man from Blankley’s”
are two of the best known. The last
Anstey whimsicality seen in Australia was
the tricky “Brass Bottle,” out of which not
much brass was made. Aladdin, by the
way, will be that clever Australian, Madge
Titheradge; and the Widow Twankey will
be Stanley Lupino, a brother of Barry, who
is the magician in the Bailey-Tait show on
the same subject.
“Cecil M. B.”: I went to see lan Mac-
laren in “David Garrick,” and came away
wondering why those old-timers didn’t warn
us about what was coming. On Mr. Ingot’s
table were copies of London Graphic and
The Great War.
“J.F.H.” (London) : The long innings of
revue is coming to an end at last, and,
thank Heaven! most theatre-goers say.
With hardly an exception the variety houses
are reverting to the old turns, or, as in the
case of the Palace, the Oxford and the Pavilion,
devoting the whole evening to dramatic fare.
The brief career of “Airs and Graces,” at
the Palace, in spite of such a reigning
favorite as Gertie Miller, convinced Alfred
Butt that the public was fed up with revue
even of the most gorgeous, expensively-
dressed and beauty-chorused description.
For his Christmas attraction at the Palace
he is therefore going to present a new musi-
cal comedy, and has persuaded one-time pro-
fessional beauty Lily Elsie, who married a
Caledonian millionaire, to emerge and appear
in the leading role. G. P. Huntley will also
be in the cast.
Gaby Deslys, the French damsel with the
scanty wearing apparel and the astonishing
headgear, threatens to pay her “first pro-
fessional visit to Australia” when the war
is over.
Stalls of Her Majesty's, Sydney, at “The
Bing Boys ” Rehearsal.

for the legs of the chorus.
“0.K.”: “II.O.” asks, “Whence the con-
vention that Hamlet should be a slim, god-
looking Dane?” That’s easy. Ophelia
deplores the mental breakdown of a scholarly
courtier who has hitherto been “the glass of
fashion and the mould of form, the observed
of all observers.” It has suited an occa-
sional plump star of burly proportions to
argue that Hamlet may be presented as a
thickset fellow of 35. George C. Miln,
rather short, heavy and middle-aged, pleaded
justification for his stage picture, but the
evidence of the text was against him. The
gone-mad Prince, according to the Grave-
digger. was a man of 30 at the time of
Ophelia’s burial. Yorick, dead 23 years,
had borne him on his back a thousand times.
The gravedigger had held his billet, man
and boy, for 30 years; and he came to it
on the very day when young Hamlet was
born. As for his reference to his “too solid
flesh.” it would apply under the circs, to
the flesh of the leanest of morbid mourners.
The only sound argument in favor of a
fleshy Hamlet is Gertrude’s remark during
a pause in the fencing test between Hamlet
and Laertes: “Our son is fat and scant of
breath. Here, take my napkin, rub thy
brows.” But Gertrude may be assumed to
speak as a sport, who observes that the
matured athlete is a trifle out of condition
after his recent holiday-trip to England. He
would be comparatively fat and scant of
breath if he were only 101 b. above his nor-
mal fighting weight, and this comes to him
in the last two acts only. No, Hamlet is
understood to be a handsome, active, shapely-
expert in fence. He talks of his sinews,
and some words spoken by his father s spook
imply that the young man is spry and mus-
cular.
Leonard Willey, the Australian actor, and
his wife, Irby Marshall, of Queensland, both
well known for their good work in the
LEONARD WILLEY, Australian actor, as
Allen Doone’s villain in New York.
Williamson dramatic cos. of a few years
back, have been doing excellently in N’York.
Margaret Anglin during her tour here
admired the work of Willey, and when he
arrived in America three years ago she
engaged him as leading man for “Lady
Windermere’s Fan.” Next, he was starred
with his wife in Shakspearean plays, making
a big success in Boston with “The Taming
of the Shrew.” Willey then joined the Punch
and Judy Theatre in N’York for a most
interesting production of a boy’s idea of
“Treasure Island.” The pirates were pirates
with tremendous buckles, swords, slashed
faces and fierce beards, and other pirates
who carried green parrots and threw bags of
gold about. Willey was the juvenile lead
playing Captain Smollet, and Willey, junior,
claims that it was the best thing Pa has ever
done. From “Treasure Island” the Aus-
tralian went to Greek plays under Granville
Barker, and after another interesting season
he was with John Drew. Then he joined
Cyril Maude’s company, playing Jarvis in
“Grumpy.” Lately he was appearing as
“Stunning Warrington,” with Drew in
“Pendennis” on Broadway, and before that
was the villain w T hom Allen Doone thwarted
in “Lucky O’Shea” at New York.
Phil Finkelstein, who has issued the
Firm’s communiques in Melbourne for some
years, has been promoted to the business
manager’s beat in front of Her Majesty’s.
Harry Musgrove, who was Phil’s predecessor
in the job, has been fitted into a berth at
headquarters in Sydney.
Said now that Herbert Tree’s death in a
London nursing home was due to unnatural
causes.
Lydia Yeamans Titus, Australia’s old
friend of the baby imitations, is here again.
She comes in a “Butterfly” 5-reeler as an
old Irish lady bent on rushing her lovely
daughter and her husband’s dollars into the
hands of the frequent foreign-Count chap.
There is the usual forcefulness about Lydia’s
work, which amounts to a careful character-
study.
“M.P.A.” : Some P.P. contributor told us
a few weeks back that Geraldine Ferrar, the
prima donna of the Metrop. Opera House.
N. York, had gone into pictures. Quite 12
months ago writer dragged The Bulletin’s
most blas@ Sundry Show-man to view Gerald-
ine in “Maria Rosa,” a Spanish story which
gave the star fine scope for her temperamen-
tal acting. We agreed that it w T as worth the
admission-money to see Wallace Reid hold
Geraldine in a passionate half-Nelson.
“Private Boxer”: E. J. Tait, explaining
things to the New York Dramatic Mirror:
Australia must depend upon America for its
theatrical companies, as very few of my countrymen
choose the stage as a profession.
Which, of course, makes it quite clear why
so many of Edward’s countrymen have gone
to America to get a job.
Bright o Smith, one-time a promising
youngs! ,• in Bland Holt’s co., is doing
vaudev.iie business these times with her bus 6
band, whom the camera presents as a
cherubic juvc:: !e. They are tending towards
Australia, the style of the firm being
Brightie and Carlyon.
“Jwosp”: N’Yark has a negro stock co
which has been doing excellent work in a
range of plays from “Charley’s Aunt” to
Shakspeare. Two years ago, when the first
all-black co. played “Othello,” there were
ribald outbursts, but the scoffers closed their
faces when Herbert Tree congratulated the
players on their Shakspearean stuff. The
scenery was not top-notch, but the acting
and dressing were spoken of in the highest
terms. The management is going in exten-
sively next year for plays by negro authors.
From the other side :
Dion Titheradge is a lieutenant and Claude Beer-
bolim is in the Canadian Field Artillery. Maori-
lander Jerome Patrick has climbed into the best
color, and is with the Officers’ Training Corps in
Canada, where he has Kenneth Hunter, who used
to be with Geach and latterly was in Fox films, as
a camp chum.
Henry Arthur Jones’s 20-year-old comedy,
“The Liars,” a favorite in Australia in the
days of Brough and Boucicault, has been
revived at the St. James’s, London, to very
affable business. If war kills, it also resur-
rects.
“S.” : The little musician weighs perhaps
7st.. and stands five-feet-two, and he wears
his hair all down his back in a manner cal-
culated to provoke ribaldry. He gets it, too.
“Well, after all, why not cut it?” I said. “Is
it worth while to put up with this for the
sake of a handful of hair?” “Wort’ while!”
cried the thrifty Dago. “Wort’ while? My-a
the word, eet ees wort’ while! Do you know-
how the mooch I mek effery a-week from the
fool who giff-a me seexpence, speak say-a!
‘Here, go getta the hair cut’? More as half-a

SONGANDANCE OF THE AGES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Adam did his songandance
And Eden was extremely gay,
No wowser had a sporting chance—
That was before the wowser’s day.
In came the Serpent ripe for fun,
And Adam’s songandance was done.
The turns then followed thick and fast,
For with the Fall the whole earth stirred :
Each loud performer hoped to last,
But kings and nations “got the bird.”
Each found that ere he’d well begun
He and his songandance were done.
The sea’s green drums that never cease,
The wind’s wild pipes that play and play
Make nfusic when we long for peace,
And dance the struggling shapes away.
“Next turn! Get off!” the prompter sings.
“The Future’s waiting in the wings!”.
With shuffling feet and backward glance,
While sea-pipes shrill and sea-drums roar,
We hear, tip-tapping on the floor,
Young feet impatient for their dance.
x.s.w.
E. O’FERRALL.
A STAR AT LAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Busk, the well-known actor, has enlisted.”
He has the part. On playing it intent,
The odds are that he'll make a biggish hit.
He signed up for the run, then happy went
To see about his make-up and his kit.
1.0 ! Everything was “found,” and ne'er a cent
Had he to part. He’d jumped from walking gent.
To leading man, a star in the legit.!
No imitation props! Make no mistake,
His togs down to a button are correct;
His rifle and his ba; <>">'t no fake—-
They’re meant for ! tiling, not for stage effect;
To pot the villain ev'iy time and break
His power for evil. What applause will shake
The playhouse when his wild career is cheeked!
“Lines” are but few, but “business” takes up time,
And “rotten”-perfect in it he must be
Before he goes on ; though there’ll be no lime,
His acting ail the world will plainly see.
A bigger chance ne’er comes to any mime—
The company supporting him how prime,
The theatre one where he’ll make history!
The play is “War”; khaki’s the only wear!
A patriot each member of the cast.
How strange to find that jealousy is rare,
The centre-of-tlie-stage idea is past!
His comrades’ luck only too proud to share,
To martial music, head up in the air,
He steps and knows he’s got the part at last!

The £7OOO STUDEBAKER GOLD
in its own Display Stand and Draping's
at the Show and Sales Rooms,
177 Elizabeth Street, Sydney.
Not only is the Studebaker Gold Car
the most beautiful and costly that has
ever been brought to Australia, but the
special setting is most unique, seeing
that it is designed to show up in detail
many of the numerous points of superi-
ority of the Studebaker Series 18 Cars.
Close inspection of the picture will reveal
a plate-glass mirror let into the floor o)
the stand so that the whole of the under
works can, with comfort, be minutely
inspected.
Only a few more days remain in which
this exhibit can be seen in Sydney, for
early in the New Year it will be packed
and shipped to Adelaide, where it will
be one of the features of the initiation of
the soon-to-be-opened direct Studebaker
Branch in the South Australian capital.
If you are thinking of buying a car, do not fail to inspect the Studebaker
Series 18 line, for in no other car costing less than £6OO will you
find the equivalent of Studebaker equipment, though for Studebakers
you pay from £l5O to £175 less and deliveries can be made now.

To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous liair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered plieminol mav be
applied directly to the objectionable hair-
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair, but to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Removing Her Skin.
The quickest and surest way to make a
good complexion out of a bad one is to
actually remove the thin veil of faded or dis-
colored outer skin from the face. This can
be done easily, safely and privately by any
woman. The process is one of gentle absorp-
tion.
Get some pure mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply it at night like cold cream,
washing it off in the morning. In a few
days the mercolide in the wax will have
absorbed the disfiguring cuticle, revealing
the fresh young skin underneath; you will
have a beautiful, clear, natural complexion.
The process is pleasant and harmless, making
the face look brilliantly attractive and youth-
ful. It also effectually removes such blem-
ishes as freckles, tan. moth patches, liver
spots, pimples, etc. Every woman should
keep a little mercolised wax on hand, as this
simple, old-fashioned remedy is the best com-
plexioned beautifier and preserver known.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is now used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiness and large pores in the
skin. You have only to- drop a tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, into a
glass of hot water and bathe the face with
the liquid after the effervescence has sub-
sided. The blackheads will then come right
off on the towel. The enlarged pores immedi-
ately contract to normal and the greasiness
disappears, leaving the skin smooth, soft and
cool and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent it is
advisable _to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
One need, not resort to the very question-
able expedient of hair dye in order not to
have grey hair. The grey hair can easily be
changed back to a natural color in a few
days time merely by the application of a
simple, old-fashioned and perfectly harmless
home-made lotion. Procure from your chem-
ist two ounces of tammalite concentrate and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this to the hair a few times with a smail
sponge, and you will soon have the pleasure
of seeing your grey hair gradually darkening
to the desired shade. The lotion is pleasant,
not sticky or greasy, and does not injure the
liair in any way.
Naturally Wavy Hair.
v stallax not only makes the best possi-
ble shampoo, but has the peculiar property of
leaving the hair wjth a pronounced natural
wave, an effect presumably desired by many
ladies. A tcaspoonf.ul of the stallax granules,
dissolved in a cup of hot water, is ample for
a luxurious head wash, and leaves the hair
with a jpeculiar lustre and fluffiness obtainable
from nothing else as far as known. It is per-
fectly harmless, and can be obtained from
most chemists, although since it has been but
little used for this purpose it comes only in
ilb. sealed original packages, enough to make
up 25 or 30 individual shampoos. [2

KTRNBANK, Arthur Street, Croydon, X.‘3.' Vl
A new tipple consisting of a mixture of
cordite and gun-oil was invented a while ago
by a thirsty gunner at the Front whose
scientific knowledge told him that there was
alcohol in explosives. His example isn'r
likely to be followed by anybody who knew
what the recovery was like.
“S.” : In proof of the fact that the bush-
man likes his pill with plenty of venom in it,
here’s a testimonial received from Billjim
by the manufacturer of a well-known pellet
for insurrecting debilitated livers. Billjim
wrote; “Those are splendid pills of yours.
Send me some more. Best pills I ever took.
They damn near killed me.”
The latest D.S.O. is a Victorian Light
Horseman, Lieut.-Col. M. \V. ,7. Bourchier,
whose people live at Strathmerton (Vic.).
Born in 1881, he swapped a lieutenancy in
the local Light Horse for similar rank in
the A.1.F., and after some strenuous stunts
in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, secured
two “mentions,” three promotions and his
present honor.
Ned Stanley, who some 50 years ago was
known as one of the dandiest roughriders
in the Victorian police force, had eight sons,
seven of them over six feet and scaling from
12 to 17 stone, and the eighth was so near
the limit that the difference didn’t matter.
The seven are still alive and hearty, with
the exception of one who was accidentally
killed in the Rockies about 15 years ago.
“Murrumbidgee, V.C.” : After church par-
ade tin l C. of E, padre said, “I wish to speak
to those who have not been confirmed. Will
the men divide themselves into two parties,
please? Those who have fall out on the
right and those who have not on the left.”
Most of us fell out on the right. In the
I heard this: “You been confirmed.
Bill' “Bet yer life! Got the marks on me
arm yet.”
‘O. Longlook”: Lovely woman must be
wearing a lot of scrumptious lingerie these
war-vexed days if the signs and portents
mean anything. One Collins-street shop
gives a daily display in a special island
window, showing a different nightie every
time, flanked by an assortment of etc., etc.,
all in China silks of the most alluring tints.
Another indication of what is going on
may be observed in the frequency of raffle-
tickets for all manner of intimate items in
champagne, sweet-briar, pale-blue and lilac.
Black lady-pyjamas, also in China silk, are
regarded as very—but, there! Most of ’em
will be back to pink flannelette again before
they are five years older.
A. T. Saunders, who spends half his time
digging up old facts relative to S. Aus.,
declares that neither Randall nor Cadell
can, as usually supposed, be claimed to have
first navigated the waters of the Murray.
Sturt of course discovered it, rowing down
fiom the Darling. But after him came a
German named Gerstacker, who in May.
1851, canoed himself down from Albury
into S. Aus., thus (incidentally) anticipat-
the “River Rovers” bv
half a century or so. Brady, by the way, is
in these days pioneering the remotest part
or the Gippsland forest, almost opposite
where the Cumberland was recentlv mined,
pome day he hopes to be nearly as well
known for his pigs as his poems.
D.M.F.”: Federal Government Depart-
ments, whose heads are continually platitu-
dinising to the public about economy, don’t
know what the word means. Here is an
example. One Department sends over 200
telegrams daily, each containing about 30
words. Por each message a sheet of fine
foolscap bearing a variety of official head-
ings and signatures is used. Except for
about three words all the messages are iden-
tical, and about 50 are sent to each of five
addresses. By coding, the whole wmuld be
contamed in five 200-w r ord messages, one to
each btate, where now over 6000 words are
transmitted. The characteristically dull
departmental explanation is. “Oh. these
messages cost us nothing.” But they cost,
the originating department the time and
stationery, and load the wires with 5000
unnecessary words.

STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families ill the
country who are often a day’s journey
from tlie nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried bv thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Riley Streets, Sydney.
Try This Corn Cure.
You will never know how easy it is to
get rid of corns until you have tried
Handy Corn Cure. Nothing like it has
ever been produced.
Oh! My! Corn-pains in every nerve!
It will dumbfound you, especially if
you have tried everything else for corns—
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we will refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
vour toes with bandages ; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn —well, you will appreciate
Handy Corn Cure. Try Handy Corn
Cure for any corn, callous, wart or
bunion. It never fails.

HIGH day and holiday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And -with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

The Inky Way.
“A.H.A.”: One Australian, at least, owes
deep thanks to Dr. Morrison, nowadays the
Political Adviser to the Government of
China, and at home on six months’
leave. This Australian was a war-corres-
pondent for M.L. papers during the Boxer
Rebellion. He took the precaution to get
a letter of introduction from the M.L. Gov-
ernor, Ranfurly, to a gubernatorial cobber
of his at Hongkong. This genial Excellency
armed him with a letter of introduction to
Sir Claude Macdonald, British Ambassador
at Peking. When he had managed to reach
Peking, per transport, French gunboat,
Chinese wheelbarrow, river sampan, boot
and mule, he looked everywhere for a lodg-
ing. There wasn’t a hotel habitable in
the shelled city, and he knew no one in
Peking. Then he remembered his letter of
introduction, and made his way to the Brit-
ish Legation. He butted in, a painfully
shabby object, at afternoon tea—the after-
noon tea that ladies will insist on having on
Judgment Day. He wasn’t welcomed effu-
sively. The Ambassador’s wife seemed to
think that there were too many correspon-
dents about; she was quite bothered with
them —and they all brought letters of intro-
duction. Also, there wasn’t an inch of
accommodation left in the Legation. Surely
he knew someone in Peking? A memory of
Dr. Morrison came up, and the lady politely
lent the correspondent a “boy” to guide him.
Xow, this correspondent had never met Dr.
Morrison ; but by chance it was Dr. Morrison
whom lie encountered at his own door.
“Hullo!” he said, “what can I do for you?”
The correspondent answered, “I’m an ' Aus-
tralian !” The word was enough. “Come
in !” Morrison said to the battered and sus-
picious-looking object on the Chinese mule.
“You’d better stay with me till you find
somewhere else to go.” And the correspon-
dent did, for some weeks.
“B.B.”: ' Humorous dog, my friend
Blanker, on the reporting string of the
Sydney Evening Snaps ! He was due for
an afternoon off yesterday, and I was to
take over his work while attending to my
own. This is how he broke the news to me:
Dear Bill,—l have not left you much. There is a
verdict to get in murder trial at Central Criminal
Court, and there will he sentences (only) at the
Quarter Sessions. It will be necessary to keep an
eye on the High Court in case some rush applica-
tion is made by the Ryans or the Cattses. You
might_ drop into Hevdon’s Court, also, Rolin’s; but
I don't think you’ll get more than a column from
either. There are a couple of cases coming on in
the District Court, and there may be some Quarter
Sessions appeals. You won’t get much else. If
you find time hanging heavy you can do a week-end
special. But I leave that to yourself. It is a fine
afternoon for a swim.
It was! I took the first boat to Manly.

fractured Uncle Sam’s neutrality with pro-

THE UNAPPRECIATIVE ONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The poet all a breezy day
Sang down the long, rich sweep of hill
To where the creek in wanton play
Gave echo to his happy trill.
He sang of joyousness and love
To liehened rock and twinkling tree,
The green below, the blue above,
And Nature answered him with glee,
The red bird and the golden bee.
“The whistling song is good, is good,”
The parrot said, and caught the tune;
The bugling magpie understood,
The wind took up the singer’s rune,
And carried it among the boughs ;
The sly, brown jester laughed in long
Approval, and the placid cows
Were pleased to hear the minstrel’s song;
The keets responded in a throng.
The poet let his hair blow free,
He drew creation at his heels,
Felt lilt of Spring, and stir of sea ;
He gave no craven thought to meals, *
But Pan-like ruled, and softly smiled
To hear the crows’ delighted taws,
And see the creatures of the wild,
With little beaks and ready claws
Bestowing well-deserved applause.
Alas! that joy may not abide!
The poet wears an ugly scowl.
The song that won a countryside,
Charmed snake and kangaroo and owl,
He did up in a packet neat,
And posted townward o’er and o'er,
To find success was incomplete.—•
The ravished things of sea and shore
Did not include an editor!

The Happy Tower.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HEAD a tale of a mighty tower
On the shores of a northern sea,
Where the mourning wind came wild
and wet
And muttered hatred and shrieked regret;
But that is no tower for me,
With the long grey line of the wintry foam,
And the spars of a ship that drifted home.
The tower I build is a happy tower ;
It is slender, strong and high,
And through its windows your eyes may see
The wing of a bird float glossily
Or nothing at all but sky,
The delicate jest in the dawning’s smile
Or the pale reflex of a sunlit mile.
It is not so far that, on summer nights
Should I from the window lean,
I could not smell through the dusky air
The breath of a thousand blossoms rare
That come from the gardens green;
To hark to the fret of a sun-sick rose
Or guess the joy that the young grass knows.
It is not so low that the prying eyes
Of the small earth-people can look within;
It is far too lofty for id'e tales.
For whispering corners and sordid vales;
Too high for a sneer to win ;
And the vain earth-contests and foolish lies
Are changed to music before they rise.
So close to the stars that they seem as
friends;
So near to the moon’s white face
That she brushes the ledge with her powdered
bloom,
And writes with her pencils on the gloom
Until, in that quiet place,
She has graven into the soul of me
A silver dream for a legacy.
The tower I build is a happy tower.
It lifts to a cloudless cope,
And into the opal-tinted eve
With eager fingers I sit and weave
A ladder of fairy rope.
Perhaps some day, when the dream comes
true,
I will make that ladder a stair for you!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Mr. Dampier’s Young Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
riIOWARDS the end of August in the
year 1699, Mr. William Dampier-
of Yeovil in Somersetshire, the
Spanish Main and tile China Seas, and now
commanding 11.M.5. Roebuck upon the N.W.
coast of Australia —came ashore in a little
cockle-boat on a sandy beach somewhat
nor’-east of Shark Bay. With him were
two of his crew —the fat boatswain. Richard
Corbin of Deal, and a seemingly hand-
some gunner’s-mate named Jan Pentraeth,
of Falmouth in Cornwall.
There are two versions of the incidents of
that sunny morning in the sand dunes—the
one that Mr. Dampier records in his fasci-
nating “Journal,” and the other that Tan
Pentraeth wrote to his sister, Mistress Mary
Polwarne, the brewer’s wife of St. Ives, and
sent home from Timor in the following
December.
This is what journalist William Dampier
says. He omits a good deal —as do most
great journalists. They had stumbled
across, or been stumbled across by, some
representative Australians of the period :
So a nimble young Man that was with me, seeing
one of them hear, ran towards them; and they for
some time ran away before him. But he soon over-
taking them, they faced about and fought him. He
had a Outlaws and they had wooden Lances; with
which, being many of them, they were too hard
for him. When he fir§i ran towards them I chas’d
two more that were by the shore ; but fearing how
it might be with my young Man, 1 turned back
quickly, and went to the top of a Sandhill, whence
I saw him near me, closely engag’d with them. Upon
their seeing me, one of them threw a Lance at me
that narrowly miss’d me. I discharged my Gun to
scare them; till finding the young Man in great
danger from them and myself in some, and that
though the Gun had a little frightened them at first,
yet they had soon learnt to despise it, tossing up
their Hands, and crying Pooh, pooh, pooh; and
coming on afresh with a great Noise, I thought it
high time to charge again, and shoot one of them,
which I did. The rest, seeing him fall, made a
stand aggin ; and my young Man took the Opportunity
to disengage himself, and come off to me; my
other Man also was with me, who had done nothing
all the while, having come out unarm’d ; and I re-
turned back with my Man, designing to attempt the
natives no farther, being- very sorry for what had
happened already. They took up their wounded
Companion ; and mv young Man, who had been struck
through the Cheek by one of their Lances, was
afraid it had been poison’d. But I did not think
that likely. His Wound was very painful to him,
being made with a blunt Weapon. But lie soon
recovered of it.
That is what Captain Dampier makes of
it. And this is the very incomplete and
somewhat bitter comment of Jan Pentraeth,
in his letter to bis sister :
Ye bloudy-minded pint, hee did design to Maroon
me upon ye barrefi shoars of New Holland if so be
thatte I did not informe him of what ye First Luf-
t’nint did saye toe mee construing his intention to
bring ye Cap’n before . a Coart Marshal when ye
shippe did come agayne to England or mayhap at ye
Cape of Good Hope, for his hard usage of him, Mr.
Fisher, during ye V’yage. Which I w’d in no wise
consent to saye to his satisfying. Wherefore ye
bloudy tyrant give orders to ye bo’s’n, that fat
raskle Dick Cawbin, to row him back to ye shippe
and did present hys piece at my buzzom, crying he
w’d leave me ashore. And I perceving some of ye
Indians approache did damn him for a crewel knave
and did saye I w’d cast in my lot with ye Indians
for that they were whiter Men than was Hee, Will’m
Dampeer, and soe in my Despayre did run toward
them. But they did give me but poor welcome with
Lances, and w’d like to have slayn mee. For hys
shame ye lousy villen could not but come to my
rescue and wee drove ye Indians off, but not before
a Lance had pearced my cheake. And I do solemnly
sware to be even with ye Hound of Hell, Cap’ll Will
Damnecr, and will sneke for Mr. Fisher at ye Coart
Marshal, and if I doe find Cap’ll Damneer ashore in
England will bete him sounly. Soe help me God.
This is what happened.
The commander of the Roebuck’s business
ashore was entirely free, in the first in-
stance, from any design of marooning Jan
Pentraeth. as that hot-headed youth sup-
posed. He merely sought for water.
Jan Pentraeth was a Cornishman, and.
like all Cornishmen, he had a grievance. His
was that he had had no desire whatsoever
to make a voyage to New Holland in H.M.S.
Roebuck, or any other ship. Very naturally.
On the 12th of January, 1699, The Merry
Thought, of Bristol, of which he was second
mate, had anchored in the Downs, after two
years’ voyaging in the West Indies and the
Americas. On the evening of the 13th he
had gone ashore in Deal, had taken his ease
and a considerable quantity of brown Octo-
ber ale—which is strong drink to-day, and
was stronger in Queen Anne’s time—in The
Maid of Kent Tavern, and in the forenoon
of the 14th had staggered up the ladders
from the Roebuck’s lower deck to an aston-
ishing panorama of the white cliffs of Dover,
looming up through the driving grey rain
squalls of an easterly gale, on the starboard
side.
For a full minute Jan Pentraeth had
stared at Dover Castle, high placed on its
green height, as it receded rapidly over the
starboard quarter, and then, with a sense
of injury and wrong, had made his way to
the quarterdeck, where he encountered Dick
Corbin, the boatswain, busily superintending
the stowage of some cabin stores which yet
remained on deck.
“God’s bones!” he exclaimed, “ivhere be
to, ye fat firkin—where be to?”
“New Holland, ye Cornishman; an
ye’re rated A.B. ’Tis not your watch —get
ye below, an’ be d —d to ye !”
Without any explanation further than
this, Mr. Corbin had seized a belaying-pin
from the mizzen-mast and had whacked him
on the head.
Subsequently the captain had merely
smiled at his complaint, and had made him
a gunner’s-matej which was small consola-
tion. Mr. Dampier had himself, with the
aid of his boatswain and some ’longshore-
men, shanghaied Jan Pentraeth. as he lay
like a log at midnight in the ingle nook of
The Maid of Kent. There were few Navy
captains of that time who, being in need of
such a likely seaman, would not have done
the same thing. But neither was that any
consolation to the homesick sailorman, and
his grievance rankled. It rankled bitterly.
The seven-months’ voyage—across to
Brazil and then over an immense waste of
water to the north-west coast of Australia
—had not been a yachting cruise. The
Roebuck was old, unhandy and unseaworth.v,
and was badly found in every respect. It
was the way of My Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty to send their captains
round the world with the craziest of equip-
ment —they were to treat the great Anson
even more wretchedly in a few years’ time.
And her commander had a temper as vari-
able and unpleasant as that of an equally
famous navigator who came to gnef over
it a century later in 11.M.5. Bounty—
William Bligh. Dampier’s treatment of his
first-lieutenant was so bad that the court-
martial which investigated it in 1702 found
it necessary to “Adjudge that Ilee be Fined
all Ilis Pay to ye Chest at Chatham exclu-
sive of about Fifty Pounds slop'd in ye
Treasury of ye Navies’ Hand for indemnify-
ing the Queen as to a Bill drawn on ye
Navy Board by Lt. Fisher from Lisbon:
And itt is farther the opinion of ye Court
that the said Capt. Dampier is not a Fitt
person to be employ’d as Coindr. of any of
her Ma’ty ships.”
So mutiny smouldered all the voyage, and
not the least mutinously inclined amongst
the crew was that aggrieved seaman out of
Falmouth, Jan Pentraeth.
“ ’Tis as dry and barren-seeming here as
elsewhere, Dick,” resumed Dampier gloomily
as he stared shoreward from the water’s
edge at the white hummocks of the sandhills
glowing in the morning sunlight, with
splashes of green spilt over their snowy
bosoms where the samphire grew. Beyond
their swelling crests was the clear blue of a
cloudless sky, and, through the V-shaped
valleys between, the grey-green tops of
stunted forest-growths appeared. When the
little boat grounded on the beach, and they
stepped ashore, the lonely place was as
silent as an arctic waste. There was nothing
of life but the wheeling seabirds circling
and swooping over the deep blue strip of
ocean behind them. A mile out, the Roe-
buck rolled sluggishly at anchor, the flag of
St. George drooping lazily over the great
stern lantern on her high-built poop. There
was not enough breeze to waft the great
ensign clear of the rail.
That bandy-legged, broad-beamed, paunch-
bellied mariner of East Kent, the boatswain,
spat on the sand disgustedly, as he waddled
in his captain’s wake.
“ ’Tis a poor country, sir, this New
Holland, and like to have no hopes of ever
being any better,” he grunted. “D’ye think
we’ve any chance of finding water here-
about? ’Tis but nine casks left in th’ ship,
an’ that rotten an’ stinldn’.”
“Pigs wouldn’ drink ’en, so be ’twas
swilled in their troughs,” growled Jan Pen-
traeth.
Dampier wheeled on him in a moment. It
was as though the seaman’s muttered better-
ing of Corbin’s complaint was the last thing
the vexed and disappointed leader —scurvy in
the ship, three weeks’ unavailing search for
water on this arid coast, and always the
whimper of mutiny—the last thing that he
would stand. The storm of his strained
temper broke fiercely over the head of Jan
Pentraeth.
“God’s curse on ye, ye craven-hearted
wastrel!” he shouted at the young man, his
usually gentle face convulsed with wrath
and his dark eyes lit with a light of anger.
“Zounds, ye knave! ’Tis nought but a
trough is fit drinking-place for such swine as
you! By God, ’tis enough to spoil the
humor of an angel to look at your sorry
face! I’ve had naught but trouble with ye
since I shipped ye in the Downs!”
“Did I ask ye for to ship me?” the young
man flung at him sullenly.
“Silence, fellow! For Dios. I’ll rid the
ship of ye. ye ill-conditioned dog. I’ll give
ye some of the discipline of the Caribbees,
my man—a taste of the old buccaneer treat-
ment. ’Twill cure your peevish vapors, I’ll
warrant ye. Look ye! If ye like not King
William’s ship Roebuck, ye can take your
bellyful of New Holland. Dick —Dick Cor-
bin,” he called to the boatswain, who was
securing the boat with a small anchor.
“Dick, we leave this fellow, here to-day.
He’ll set no foot aboard my ship again. By

NO BLADE SO KEEN
NO SHAVE SO CLEAN.
God—we’ll maroon the saucy hound ! I’ve
had enough of his scowling visage to last me
a lifetime. D'ye hear me, bo’s'n?”
“Aye, aye, sir,” growled the old salt, with-
out emotion. “Aye, aye, sir—l’ll send him
his duds ashore when you and I go back
aboard.”
“Maroon me!” gasped the young man,
paling a little. He had come across what
was left of other men who had been
marooned in such spots as this. Stinking
water and bad food in the Roebuck were
better than no water at all in this land of
devils.
, "Ye can’t do it!” he sneered doubtfully.
", Tis a King’s ship. ’Tis agin th’ Articles
o War.”
“Is it, by God? We’ll see! Now do you
walk in front of us whiles we go seek an
Indian to show us where their water is.
Ye’ll render me this last service, my pretty
fellow, before we part.”
He cocked his piece and pointed with its
barrel to the sandhills. Then he covered
Jan’s breast a moment, and lowered the mus-
ketoon again.
“Go !” he said. “Lead the way, ye d—d
rogue or I’ll put a ball into your hog’s body.”
“ ’Twill not alone be Mr. Fisher ye’ll face
the court-martial over, Cap’n Dampier, I tell
’fee sure,” growled Pentraeth, as they walked
up the beach.
“Mr. Fisher! What’s to do with Mr.
Fisher and courts-martial? By God, that
settles me! Ye’ll stay here and rot, ye dog.”
And so they went into the sandhills, and
found the Australians.
But Jan was not to be "the first Cousin
Jack to settle in Westralia. Mr. Dampier’s
rage abated with the shooting of the black-
fellows. Not so the bitter Cornislnnan’s.
* * * *
Interval of-three years.
* * * *
In the twilight of a beautiful June even-
ing in 1702, Mr. William Dampier was
rowed ashore from H.M.S. London, lying at
Spithead, where he had been spending one of
the unpleasantest afternoons of his career.
His mind was possessed by bitter considera-
tions of the injustice of raking up old scores,
the advisability of allowing sleeping dogs to
lie, the vindictiveness of some men, and the
deplorable fact that his career as an officer
in the Royal Navy was abruptly and rudely
terminated. So the court-martial had decreed.
He reflected sadly, as he set foot on Ports-
mouth Hai’d. that his career as a certificated
explorer and navigator was also at an end.
Whatever of the strange parts of this inter-
esting planet he might investigate in the
future, he would do so in a private capacity
—as lie had done before for the best part of
bis life —and not as the captain of a Queen’s
ship. He would have to go back, for a very
subsistence, to the old buccaneering, priva-
teering, piratical days that had preceded his
first visit to New Holland with the muti-
neers of the Cygnet. The navy was a closed
book. Maybe, he brooded miserably, he
would close his adventurous life a-dangling
from the yard-arm of a man-o’-war. Will
Dampier was a sad man when he came
ashore that summer’s night in Portsmouth.
And outside the door of The Nag’s Head
—a low tavern frequented by inferior naval
ratings, situated in the narrow street through
which his way lay to his inn—there awaited
him the gunner of the London, who had tes-
tified enthusiastically against him in the
forenoon, in the presence of that hard-bitten
tableful of captains.
The gunner of 11.M.5. London was one
Jan Pentraeth, native of Falmouth, in Corn-
wall. And Jan Pentraeth was pot at all
grateful for his good discharge from H.M.S.
Roebuck, signed “Win. Dampier,” even
though it had gained him his present exalted
position in a line-o’-battleship.
“You mark me, in’ lads,” vaunted Mr.
Pentraeth —-“you mark me, an’ see how I
deal wi’ such pirates as Master Will Dam-
pier. Maroon me, would he! Gi’ me two
dozen at th’ gangway, bigod! Call me a
stinkin’ o’ th’ gar’son o’ Pendennis
Castle! By th’ livin’ Saint Michael, ’tes
Jan’s turn noiv 7”
Up the winding street strode the broken
man, sore from the grins of the boat’s, crew
of the London —who had not, every day of
their hard lives, the happy felicity of rowing
disrated post-captains ashore.
Jan Pentraeth swaggered out into the
roadway to meet him, and stood, with folded
arms across a bosom that swelled with exul-
tation, opposite the tavern door —a sneer on
his dark Phoenician face, and very conscious
of the delightful admiration which lie in-
spired in the group of his cronies, who clus-
tered about the low doorway to witness his
triumph.
Dampier lifted up his dim eyes, as he
became aware of the tall figure that blocked
his passage below the gable of the old inn. A
shipmate—one of the men who, had shared in
the vicissitudes of the crazy old Roebuck !
Well, ’twas a relief to meet with any old
shipmate—even with one who had proved
himself an enemy—at the close of this weary
day. He was glad even to meet with his
malcontent gunner’s mate, sink him if he
wasn’t!
Pentraeth opened his mouth to pour forth
the vials of his contemptuous and triumphant
wrath —when he met his captain’s eye,, as
the latter came to a standstill before him, a
little smile playing about his lips, with his
hand extended.
Dampier’s deep brown eyes had something
in them that had won the affections of many
men who cared little enough for their kind.
There was a gleam of humor in them, a sug-
gestion of kindliness, a hint of fellowship—
when they were not hard in anger—that
found men’s hearts.
“Well, Jan. my hearty,” he said, a little
wistfully. “ ’Tis all over. I bear ye no
illwill. Ye’ll drink a dram with your old
captain ?”
To the astonished disappointment of the
crew in the doorway, they beheld the trucu-
lent, the implacable and so lately triumph-
ant gunner of the London put forth his
horny hand and grasp that of “the ——
pirate.”
God’s shoe-buckles! They were bewil-
dered.
“Make way there —make way !” bellowed
Mr. Dampier’s nimble young man. “Give
way for Master Dampier, who found New
Holland!”
“Nay, nay. .Tan.” laughed Damnier. “Say,
rather, who lost the cursed country.”
Half an hour after, when they came out
of the candlelight into the darkness, Dam-
pier was saying :
“So that’s the way of it, Jan. I’ve to go
a-roving again for my bread. And these
City o’ London merchants, they’ve found me
two ships, the St. George and the Cinque
Ports—an’ I’ll warrant ye they’re better
found than the old Roebuck—and Igo to the
Spanish Main to harry the d —d Dons. 'Twill
be profitable venture for all who sail with
me. Ye’ll leave the London, then —I’ll find
ye good hiding in Deptford—and sail with
me as gunner in the St. George? ’Tis such
as you I’m needing. I’ve got good old Dick
Corbin of Deal. Ye’re willing to sail with
me?”
“By God, I be, Cap’n! Wi’ none better,”
enthusiastically cried Jan Pentraeth. “I’ll
post wi’ ye to Lunnon this night—an’ dam'
th’ Queen’s sarvice!”
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Gins’ Corroboree.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY certain sounds from around the
corner of the verandah —grunts, slaps,
splashes and the rattle of a kerosene-
tin—l knew that black Mary had a job to
“scrub-em floor.” Presently she turned the
corner, and sat up on her heels. She was
sucking an obviously empty pipe, so 1 asked
her if she would have a fill of ’bacca. Mary’s
answer was a fat black hand held out. I
gave her a fill, she loaded her pipe and stowed
the overflow away in her dillybag, and lit the
pipe with a match ferreted from her woolly
hair.
When the pipe was going full blast Mary
made her first remark. “You like see black
gins’ corroboree?”
“Ge.t out, Mary,” I said. “You’re pulling
my leg. Gins don’t have corroborees.”
“Ilabbit this one,” said Mary. “Nellie
teach it this feller.”
“When is it to be?” I asked.
“When moon jump-up little-feller way,
alonga blackfeller camp,” said Mary.
Paddy’s Nellie had always been considered
lazy because she scorned to earn stray six-
pences by wash-em clothes. It seems now
that Nellie was not lazy, but an artist.
After tea I strolled over. Big friendly
stars studded the sky—not a bit like the cold
distant stars of temperate latitudes, but
each with a color of its own. The full moon
had just risen, like a big golden lantern,
picking out the landscape in intense high
lights and clear-cut shadows.
The camp was on the bank of the creek,
just across the bridge. I followed the road,
though there was no necessity to cross the
bridge these times, as there were only a few
pools of water left.
Mary met me, and after driving off fifty
dogs of forty-seven different breeds, con-
ducted me to a seat by the old men’s fire.
The smooth sandy bed of the creek was
being prepared for the corroboree. The
audience was sitting around fires on the
raised banks, gins on one side, men on the
other. There was no doubt that Nellie was
a person of importance to-night; she bustled
around giving orders here and arguing there.
No author at a first production could be
more particular about detail.
The artists,'a dozen of the youngest gins,
were now marched on to the. ground. They
had discarded the miscellaneous clothing they
usually wore, and were decorated with gum-
sprays—a fringe around the ankles and
wrists; some hanging pendant to the arms;
a bunch, behind, like a tail. When I saw the
two rows lined up facing one another I
recognised that there was more reason behind
the average White Mary’s insistence on
Black Mary wearing clothes than is apparent
at first glance; by the light of the fires they
looked like rows of bronze statues.
Nellie gave the signal for the corroboree to
start. The older gins were all provided with
time-sticks, which they beat at first slowly
and softly. The two rows bowed to each
other and spun round, then bowed again. I
had just begun to think Nellie was giving us
an imitation of a set of ouadrilles, when they
all began to lift their arms and softly chuckle
and bow towards the centre. Then I saw at
once that they were native-companions danc-
ing. The time-sticks beat louder and faster;
the dancers kept time, spinning and moving
their arms like wings, bowing and stretching
their necks forward towards the centre of
the ring. At last, with a final crow, all
stood as still as statues. After a couple of
minutes’ interval the figure was repeated
with a few variations.
The gins and younger men were getting
more and more excited, but the old men so
far showed not the slightest sign of approval.
Nellie now drew the performers up in two
lines, facing the old men’s fire. They stood,
with hands behind their heads, swaying
slowly to the rhythm of the time-sticks, con-
tinually keeping the muscles of the thighs
quivering in an extraordinary manner. At
a signal from Nellie they sank down on their
heels, swinging the knees outwards, then
sprang up into the air, bringing the legs
together with a sounding slap. An audible
“Ugh!” of appreciation from the old men
testified that this part of the performance,
at least, was a success. The time-sticks
grew louder; the performers swayed quicker
and leaped higher until, with a final shout
for a climax, they rushed away off the
ground.
I presented the old men with a few sticks
of tobacco, and Nellie with a stick of tobacco
and a pipe, congratulating her on the success
of the show, and inquiring who taught her
tin' corrcfboree.
“Native companion teachit that one,” said
Nellie.
“Who teachit that last one?” I asked.
“Mine tlvinkit that one,” was her answer.
As I strolled home I wondered whether the
old men had coined a word to describe the
latest result of the emancipation of women.
Next morning, soon after breakfast, I met
Paddy smoking the pipe which I had pre-
sented to Nellie the night before. Paddy’s
greeting was, “Very good corroboree that one
belonga me an’ Nellie, boss. Gibbit tiepen.”
I handed out the coin and decided there
was no hurry for the word. Paddy was still
boss in his own gunyah.
