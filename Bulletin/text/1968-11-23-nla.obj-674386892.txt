With SMITHS 1969
refrigerated
autoair-conditioning
the cold air pours in
20% faster
Do we have to sell you on the advantages of
refrigerated auto air-conditioning? That’s
easy. Think of your car, 30 sq ft of hot glass,
200 sq ft of hot steel, hot engine, hot exhaust
inches away from steaming hot bitumen ...
and vou in the middle of it ail.
Now think of your car almost immediately as
cool, as pleasant as any air-conditioned
office or restaurant. No matter how shim-
mery-hot the road, how stickily-hot the tem-
perature. You drive better, safer. You work
better, more efficiently. No sticking to seats.
No damp, crumpled clothes. No finger-burn-
ing steering wheel. Noise, heat, dust, humid-
ity are kept outside. AND Smiths refrigerated
auto air-conditioning units keep it that way.
Why Smiths? Even easier to answer. Smiths
units are designed and made in Australia for
Australian conditions. Tested and proved
over millions of Australian driving miles.
(What may be fine on some 200 mile U.S.
freeway can’t be expected to adapt to our
multi-surface roads and clogged city traffic!)
Performance? Well, obviously, getting your
car cool quickly is the most important factor
in auto air-conditioning. And it’s here that
Smiths are a mile ahead—with 20% faster
cooling. Two reasons. One: the refrigerated
air pours in faster—with Smiths new heavy-
duty blower assembly and side vents to make
sure you get faster cooling of those hard-to-
cool pockets around your feet. Two: Smiths
units dissipate the hot air much faster—
with bigger, exclusive condensers.
So— Hot air out faster. Cold air in faster.
20% faster. Only with Smiths.
Any more new features in the Smiths '69
units? Certainly. The entire Smiths system-
evaporator, condenser and compressor—has
considerably greater power than any other
unit. A bigger evaporator coil of unique
design provides for an equally marked
increase of the cooling capacity inside the
car. Smiths units are light, compact and can
be installed or removed any time (unlike
non-transferable units that are built-in before
the car’s final assembly). Note, too, the posi-
tion of the controls. Designed for Australian
vehicles, they are on the driver’s side for
extra convenience and safety. And Smiths
refrigerated auto air-conditioning is quiet...
matching the cool relaxation it brings you.
The styling is exceptional—complementing
the appearance of any dash.
So why drive a hot box? It’s so easy to have
a Smiths refrigerated auto air-conditioner
installed. Write or phone any Smiths office.
We will mail you an informative brochure.
We’ll also send you the name of your nearest
dealer who’ll be glad to demonstrate for you
how Smiths 1969 refrigerated air-condition-
ing delivers 20% faster cooling.
And Smiths, world renowned for auto acces-
sories and other components (K.L.G. spark
plugs, Smiths instruments, clocks and
watches, for example), have the only truly
nation-wide network of branches, dealers
and qualified after-sales service agents.
From only $375 including tax (plus fitting).

Must be a link missing here.
Any area of your business relying on
"blotter calculation" ? Then, frankly, you
have a link missing. A vital link in a
system planned not only to cut out such
risky "blotter calculations", put to bring
you a dramatic increase in over all effici-
ency and hence contribute to a greater
profitability.
For instance, our experts can after
a fact-finding survey plan a Link-
System for you in which you link a
Remington Calculator to a Remington
accounting machine linked to a Rem-
ington Rotaprint.
Even with the basic system you would
be in an advantageous position of being
able to calculate, handle all book-keeping
details; typing, and at the same time
print all necessary documents even
in colour.
Get the idea? And whatever Link-
System you may need, we also guarantee,
without cost to you, to train your staff
(including EDP people) to efficiently
operate that system. Your enquiry will
be given our experts' complete concen-
tration. And security. All obligation-free
of course.

DECISION-MAKING
ONE OF THE MOST impelling cur-
rent speculations in Canberra is whether,
if Mr. Gorton had decided on an elec-
tion this year, Lord Casey would have
been prepared to dissolve the House of
Representatives so that an election
would have been possible. It is believed
that the Governor-General told the
Prime Minister that he did not consider
a dissolution of the House justified, but
how much further he might have gone
will now never be known.
NORMAL
THE POST OFFICE last week
announced that postal services were
back to normal after industrial trouble
in N.S.W. We now only have to find out
what normal is, then we’ll go and buy
some Christmas cards.
THE NEW BARBARISM
THE IRISH ACTOR Micheal Mac-
Liammoir was here a few years ago
for Phillip Productions, and as we had
an opportunity to find out what we
thought of him, it is now his turn
to tell us what he thought of us. It
is, of course, unfair to leaf through
an autobiography, find and isolate the
few pages about Australia, and pin him
down on those.
What makes it irresistible with Mac-
Liammoir’s is a brief paragraph in
which he writes of ringing his friend
Hilton Edwards in Dublin from Syd-
ney and Edwards asks was going to
Australia just a journey round the
world in order to get out at Clapham
Junction in a heat-wave. This seems
as good as the line Robert Morley
stole from Seymour Hicks, describing
Sydney as “Manchester with a harbor
backcloth.”
But the Celtic twilight was never so
thick for him as in sunny Australia.
He was conscious of being oppressed
at the thought of a “new European,
and in the main Anglo-Saxon, way of
life being planted over those dark and
alien lands designed by God, as it
seemed to me, so clearly for another
race, for another sort of civilisation, for
another sort of barbarism, it may be.”
The sort of barbarism he did find
is made vivid in the description of a
night at the Chevron Hotel, Sydney,
in a “passion-fruit and porridge-
colored room leading from a four-
square jade-green and beige hall and
a tangerine and chromium-plated bath-
room where the soap kept falling into
the pitch-black bath and the pitch-
black washing-basin alike, and where
the light went through a minute-long
series of hysterical quivering spasms
before the correct steel-grey glare, as
of some January afternoon in West
Wickham, had been achieved. My bed-
room there had literally buzzed and
hummed on the occasion of my first
night with television shows and radio
announcements from all sorts of
stations, none of which I desired to
look at or to listen to, but all of
which I was too butter-fingered to
banish.
“The thing had begun with a faint
and, to my ear, nauseous sound,
muffled by murmurs (distant it is
true but still there) of a sub-human
female voice accompanied by a saxo-
phone, both giving an admirable im-
pression of cats on midnight tiles as
they croon-yowled for Sex! Sex!!
MacLiammoir ... Celtic twilight at
the Chevron
SEX!!! and I would turn or was
it push? one of a myriad buttons
in order to achieve silence. Immediately
on pushing the button, a brisk male
voice boomed fortissimo through the
room giving an invigorating account
of a football match to a vocal back-
ground of uninhibited roaring (‘the
wild beast,’ as Ibanez had said: ‘the
true one, the only one’). So then I
pushed some more buttons, and the
television screen jerked to a dazzling
life, and there was a Danish-blue-
cheese-colored close-up of a lady with
enlarged pores giving ever such good
advice about How to make your
pastry light and fluffy so that the
kiddies would be pleased, and a hearty
appetite yum-yum! would accom-
pany smiling faces in every Australian
home.
“And when the third series of but-
tons had been pressed and my eyes
and ears assailed by the spectacle of
sixty-six hours’ non-stop pop by sixty-
six dancers all in the last stages of
sweaty exhaustion, their eyes boiling
over with sleepless anguish, my courage
did fail me, and I telephoned to the
porter for help.”
ACQUIRED TASTE
WHETHER spelt “yogurt,” “yoghurt,”
“yogourt,”' or “yoghourt,” the product
is essentially soured milk, and revealed
as bluntly as that it has a high “ugh”
rating on the Australian market, a
large section of which reacts strongly
against sour food of any kind. Ah! But
add flavoring to it, or mix it with what
the ad-,men call “real fruit,” and the
product becomes another new taste sen-
sation in the supermarket freezer.
Yoghurt is now being flavored,
blended, rainbow packaged, and in-
tensively promoted throughout metro-
politan Australia. Just about every
major milk-processor now markets the
stuff; milkmen will deliver it to your
door if you ask. The other day in
Sydney, one of the Woolworths chain-
stores had customers lining a footpath
for an introductory offer of a new
Peters line of yoghurt at 15c for two
8oz. cartons — half the normal price
Significantly, a saleswoman felt it
necessary to instruct as she sold . . . “Be
sure you stir it well, dear. The fruit
is on the bottom; .mix it through the
yoghurt before you eat.” Someone
probably had the same anxiety getting
us to eat potted meat paste.
In the three or four years since pro-
cessors overcame buyer resistance to
plain yoghurt by adding flavoring and
fruit, demand has sometimes gone close
to out-reaching supply. Sales are noth-
ing like as spectacular as the heavily
diversified ice-cream industry, but
present production in N.S.W. alone
amounts to at least 10,000,000 cartons a
year. The benefit is still small, but the
expansion of the market for yoghurt
is helping the perennially under-
privileged dairy farmer.
Although at present the N.S.W.
market for yoghurt only requires a
maximum of two percent of the 52
percent of the State’s milk given over
to the manufacture of dairy foods, the
milk supplied for the production of
yoghurt is not controlled by the equal-

Yoghurt is made by introducing a
lactobacillus culture into milk to induce
a curd-like consistency. Originally it
was manufactured merely as a health
food. Nutritionists such as Gaylord
Hauser still promote it as a “do-good”
food, but experience here has been that
the Australian public generally is not
interested in being done good to. Post-
war European migration set up the first
significant demand for it here.
Market research briefly grappled
with the connotative problems of the
word “yoghurt,” but appear now to
have let it remain. “The emphasis in
describing the product is on the word
fruit,” says a Dairy Farmers’ Co-op.
official. “Acceptance by teenagers has
been particularly noticeable — no doubt
due to their lack of preconceived ideas

too. Recipe leaflets distributed with one

FOR THE PAST two years, Western
Australian artist and writer. Elizabeth
Durack has been continuously on the
move—from the United States to the
Philippines to Hong Kong to Malaysia
to New Guinea—studying, drawing,
writing, and lecturing about the
indigenous peoples of each country.
She and her sister, Mary, have both
written a great deal about the Aus-
tralian outback, but now Elizabeth has
widened her field.
In the United States, the Ford Foun-
dation assisted her with a study of the
history and art of the American Red
Indian; now she has written and illus-
trated a book on Papua and New
Guinea, which was commissioned by the
Australian Department of External
Territories. Earlier in the year she
spent several months in New Guinea.
“There are deep ethnic differences
between the peoples of different
regions—those of the Highlands and
the islands, for instance,” she told us
this week in Sydney, where she is dis-
cussing publication of her book. “Tra-
ditions of tribe and place are still very
strong, although the Australian Gov-
ernment is trying to submerge them to
make New Guinea a united country.
This is theoretically sound, but
emotionally it could break down.
“There’s been great penetration of
Western culture—hospitals and big
missions established in remote areas. I
think the old traditions will vanish
completely, but the crafts will go on,
because they’re being commercialised.
They’ve changed, of course, but the
skill’s still there —and many of the
New Guineans are making a lot of
money from pottery and carving.

carried a prize of $50, but in the

opinion of the Sepik men this was con-
sidered too small. They’re getting from
$2OO to $3OO from Americans.”
Miss Durack’s book has broadened in
scope; originally it was to be a study
of the education of women in the
Territory. “There are quite a number
of women at the University of Papua
and New Guinea, mainly doing Arts
and occasionally Science, lots doing
commercial work in offices, and more
nursing. The graduates will go on to
teach in the secondary schools.” What
about women in industry? “I suppose
they’d be able to do that sort of work.
After all, 100 years ago the New
Guinea women had big trading organ-
isations for their pottery. That’s de-
clined, but there’s no reason why these
traits shouldn’t be carried on. Tradi-
tionally, the women have been great
agriculturists, too.”
The spirit in the Territory is, she
says, lively and optimistic. And what
happens next will be fascinating, since
New Guinea contains in a so far peace-
ful microcosm the issues confronting
all developing countries.
“I pose a number of questions at the
end of the book—one of them is to
wonder what kind of effect New
Guinea, as an independent country sub-
ject to all outside influences, would
have on Australia if the ties were com-
pletely loosened. I suppose we’ll have
to wait and see for the answer to that
one.”

RUTHLESS COMPETITION
IN THE
NOSTALGIA TRADE
THE OXFORD HOTEL in Swanston
Street had a re-opening last week. Now
it has wall-to-wall blood-red carpet in
every bar. The carpet is laid over
sponge rubber so that there is a feel-
ing of splendid luxury with the stuff
practically scratching the ankles. There
■are seats, for heaven’s sake, heraldic
decorations, subdued lighting, and ter-
ribly, terribly, ye olde inne signs like:
“Fourpence a night for bed. Sixpence
with pot luck. No more than five to
sleep in one bed.”
There is so much luxury being thrown
around in the pub trade it is becoming
difficult to find a dear, classic, old
pub of the six o’clock closing era. You
know the type, of course . . . lovely,
old brown lino floor, exquisite white
tile walls, the purity of the open space
with no chairs, no seats, the Edwardian
lavatory atmosphere, and the charm-
ing old railways clock, always set ten
minutes fast.
To make matters worse, Whelan the
Wrecker has almost completed his
job on the Cathedral Hotel, which had
been there beside St. Paul’s Cathedral
since 1883, always the handiest spot

Just the way it crouches low to the ground imparts the sensation of full flight! The new Dodge Phoenix
is a car with enormous power: under control but ready for release when you say so. Even the most
hardened sceptics are amazed by its agility and instant response. That’s easily understandable, too,
when you consider the size of the V 8 engines: a 318 cu. in. 230 b.h.p. or a 383 cu. in. 270 b.h.p. But
power alone is not enough. The Dodge Phoenix is also the ultimate in luxury, softness and silence.
Words are a poor substitute for your own sense of touch and feel. And that’s reason enough to see
your nearby Chrysler Dodge Phoenix dealer. Soon!

for bishops, deans, deacons, arch-
deacons, vergers, precentors, choir-
masters, and such. Ah, but wait,'if sit-
ting there in your clerical cloth ,maybe,
then you will remember a private little
bar just off the lane. The 15ft. cedar
bar, the rail, the mirrors, the bottle
racks, the whole box and dice have
been bought by the Swan Hill Folk
Museum. This museum, which has set
out to re-create a whole town of the
pioneer era, plans to buy an old log-
cabin pub and install the Cathedral
Hotel bar inside. No doubt bishops,
priests, and deacons who miss the
place will go there on little pilgrim-
ages.
Actually, this grabbing of the bar
from the Cathedral Hotel is a perfect
example of what is going on all over
Victoria. The competition in the
nostalgia trade has become bitter, ruth-
less. Aldermen, shire councillors, town
clerks, mayors, deputy .mayors, shire
engineers, sometimes disguised like CIA
men, are searching the countryside for
material. Particularly sought after are
log cabins, steam tractors, lovably old
hand - painted mining machinery,
antique signs, coaches, timber j inkers,
old lamps, and the whole bit of Vic-
toriana from grandmother’s clothing
through to bedroom crockery. If you
are hiding a bark hut at the bottom
of the home paddock, you can practi-
cally name your own price.
Swan Hill, with its Folk Museum
built around the paddle steamer, has
done such astonishing business there is
barely a town in Victoria that is not
trying to get into the act. Ballarat
has launched a fund to create an old
gold-mining town on Sovereign Hill.
They feel it might be dangerous and a
little costly to sink an actual shaft.
Cunningly they plan to build a mine
above ground, but all the atmosphere

Victoria to the Ned Kelly era!”

Moe will have a complete outdoor
museum, and the centrepiece will be
“Loren,” the old prefabricated steel
house which the Trust saved from ruin
in Curzon Street, North Melbourne.
There is a move on to restore the old
Ebenezer Lutheran Mission, circa 1858,
in the shire of Dimboola, but the plot
which really appeals to your corres-
pondent is the Castlemaine Market.
The Trust has launched an appeal
for its complete restoration. Now, the
Castlemaine Market is not one of those
horrid 19th-century collections of gal-
vanised iron roofs, it is beautiful. It has
a portico which would do just fine for
the British Museum or even our new
Victorian Arts Centre. It has four
splendid columns of a pure Greek sim-
plicity supporting an arch with a
female figure sitting on top. Many citi-
zens believe this is an act of devotion
to Queen Victoria, but the Castlemain-
ians were much more practical. The
figure is actually Ceres, the goddess of
harvests and festivals. Then on either
side of the portico there are little twin'
towers with cupolas. Inside there is a
nave with superb laminated timber
arches which support a clerestory roof.
Architects melt when they see these
arches, they are practically unique in
this country, and they talk of their
being reminiscent of Kings Cross Rail-
way Station in London. On either side
through low brick arches were the
Market stalls.
The Market was built in time for the
opening of the railway line on Octo-
ber 15, 1862. Colonel S. R. Birch, of
the Trust, has written that formerly the
Market had nothing but bare earth
inside, but was floored specially for the
occasion, and 300 people sat down to
a banquet in the presence of the Gov-
ernor, Sir Henry Barkly. They cov-
ered the walls with leaves, flowers, and
flags, and “throughout the tables,
bouquets of all sizes of the rarest
flowers were placed and pyramids of
dessert fruits were also disposed in the
most elegant manner.” That night there
was a grand ball and the supper was
laid out in the Market stalls, which
were given the wall-to-wall-carpet
treatment for the occasion.
Well, the floor which they put down
for Sir Henry Barkly is the cause of
all the trouble today. It caused sub-
floor damp, deterioration of the walls,
the lot. So the present Governor, Sir
Rohan Delacombe, is going up there on
November 23 to launch an appeal for
the restoration. One can only hope
that they will have their pyramids of
dessert fruits disposed for him in the
most elegant manner.
Finally, when the Market is restored
to its 1862 brilliance, it will become a
museum depicting the gold-mining era.
Watch out, any time now Castlemaine
councillors, disguised as tourists, will'
be roving the outback hunting for
nostalgiana.

LISTEN, THEY'RE
PLAYING OUR NONG
AGAIN
WHATEVER SCEPTICS may say, the
drama has been making headway in
this country. Television shows like
“Rita and Wally” or “I’ve Married a
Bachelor” prove that writers and actors
can find rich material in typical Aus-
tralian life. Schools .of dramatic art
are busily training young talent to meet
the needs of the local theatre.
I dropped in at the Sydney Theatri-
cal Academy, where students are taught
dramaturgy, stage technique, etc. There
I watched a class in acting and speech
conducted by the senior instructor, Mr.
Hamworth.
He said to his pupils: “I want you to
imagine yourself in a common domestic
situation. You have come home late'
for dinner and your wife is reproachful.
She complains that you do not appreci-
ate her cooking. Garrick, will you come
out first? I would like you to improvise
a suitable reply.”
A young man stood in front of the
class and spoke in a well-modulated
voice. He said: “I’m sorry I’m late,
darling. You know I’m devoted to your
cuisine.”
“Stop!” interrupted Mr. Hamworth.
“You sound like someone out of
Coward. Remember, you are training
for the Australian theatre. Now try
again.”
Garrick said: “I’m sorry I’m late,
dear. You know I like your tucker.”
“That’s better, but the accent needs
polishing. Don’t say ‘your’ say ‘yer.’

Like this: ‘Come orf it, love! I reckon
yer tucker’s real grouse.’ ”
The class murmured in admiration
of the instructor’s professionalism.
“That will do, Garrick,” he said.
“Will you have a try now, Irving? Just
carry on, explaining to your wife why
you came home late.”
Irving said briskly: “All I did was
stop at the pub for a drink with my
cobbers.”
“Not a bad attempt,” said Mr. Ham-
worth. “But the idiom is shaky.
‘Cobbers’ is semi-obsolete. Better to
say: ‘I stopped at the rubbity for a
schooner with me mates.’ Will you
repeat that?”
Irving did so. Mr. Hamworth
winced. “Not my mates —me
mates,” he said. “And you must pro-
nounce ‘mate’ properly; it’s an impor-
tant word. I want to hear a good round
diphthong ‘muh-eet.’ Understand?”
Mr. Hamworth said to the class:
“Now a quick group exercise. Imagine
you and the man next door are mend-
ing a lawnmower. You succeed, and
the mower works. What do you say to
your friend?”
Pupils answered in succession: “She’ll
do, mate.” “She’s sweet, mate.” “She’s
apples, mate.”
“Not quite right,” he said. “The
correct answer is ‘Beaudy, mate.’ Will
you repeat that?”
The class said: “Beauty, mate.
Beauty, mate.”
“Not beauty beaudy,” he said.
“If you have the opportunity, try to
hear Ron Frazer say it.”
Mr. Hamworth looked at his
watch. “That’s all,” he said. “Hurry
along or you’ll be late for the Ibsen
lecture.”
I heard later that Garrick and
Irving, now graduates of the Academy,
had leading roles in a new TV comedy
series. I went to the studio to see the
results of their training.
The show was entitled “Galah Per-
formance.” In the scene before the
cameras the actors were sitting in a
flat eating pies:
“Thank Gawd the Missus shot
through. I couldn’t stand a bar of ’er.”
“She get on yer back, mate?”
“She was always whingein’. Tellin’
me ter shave ’n that.”
“I say, mate, yer didn’t get down on
that grog, did yer?”
“Me! I don’t bludge on me mates. A
man oughta do yer.”
“Where’s them stubbies we got at the
club, well?”
“Up there behind the tomato sauce,
yer nong.”
Irving climbed on a stool to get the
bottles. Crash. He fell with beer and
tomato sauce over him.
Garrick (laughing): “Beaudy, mate!
Beaudy!”
Afterwards I went to the actors and.
congratulated them.
Garrick said: “The series does give
one a feeling of involvement. It has
traces of the Pinter influence, but it’s
essentially indigenous and vernacular.”
“Good on yer, mate,” I said.

THE QUEEN'S AUSTRALIAN SUBJECTS
Comment by ‘Observer’
TO MANY young Australians, read-
ing the reports of Immigration Minis-
ter Snedden’s speech in Parliament last
week about whether we are primarily
Australian citizens or British subjects
must have been just about as relevant
as reading through the list of titles of a
feudal monarch. To them the phrase
“British subject” might be as much
without meaning as, for example, a
medieval English king’s claim to the
crown of France.
At least it is a good thing that Mr.
Snedden should be changing the
Nationality and Citizenship Act so that
we are primarily Australian citizens and
only secondarily British subjects. But
those of us who have had no doubt on
this, anyway, cannot but ask: why not
go the whole hog? Can’t we just be
Australians and leave it at that?
For Mr. Snedden to say that “the
great majority of the Australian pub-
lic” wishes to remain British subjects
may be just nonsense. At the last Gallup
Poll 40 percent of those interviewed
said they wanted Australia to become a
republic, and there are probably
enough others who see the Queen as
Queen of Australia and themselves, if
they are to be subjects, as her Aus-
tralian subjects, for it to be likely that
Mr. Snedden’s statement is the oppo-
site of the truth, viz., a majority of
Australians don’t want to be “British
subjects.” On this kind of question one
cannot help wondering why our poli-
ticians don’t hire a research outfit to
do some survey work for them. Appar-
ently they don’t even read the results
of the survey material already avail-
able.
What on earth does the phrase
“British subject” now mean? The term
goes back to the colonial period when,
although they had responsible self-
government, the members of the Aus-
tralian colonies were still, in some ways,
subjects of the British Government. In
the period of the British Empire after
the Statute of Westminster, “British
subject” meant to Australians, in senti-
ment, that they were part of the British
Empire and, in practice, that they had
virtually the same rights, if they went
to the United Kingdom, as those who
were born there. But now that’s all
gone.
Now there is neither a British
Empire nor a British Commonwealth.
There is simply an amorphous collec-
tion of republics and monarchies called
the Commonwealth of Nations, some
members of which quarrel with each
other or conduct internal genocide, or
even fight wars with each other. To say
that Australians are “British subjects”
is not to affirm allegiance to this Com-
monwealth because this Commonwealth
itself is no longer “British.” And Aus-
tralians no longer have virtually the
same rights in the United Kingdom as
those who were born there because
there is now an immigration control
that limits their rights.
So what does “British subject” mean?
The answer is nothing at all. And
the sooner the British tell us that we
have no right to use it the better. We
are not subjects of Great Britain. We
do not share either the duties or the
privileges of the people of that king-
dom. We belong to our own kingdom,
which we do not even call a kingdom,
taking our name instead from Crom-
well’s republic, but if, in feudal law,
we are anybody’s subjects, we are the
subjects of the Queen of Australia.
It is extraordinary that those Aus-
tralians who are royalists and who want
the Queen to be Queen of Australia do
not see what harm they do to their
cause and to Australia’s conscious-
ness of itself by confusing their
belief in a Queen of Australia with the
pretence that we are still also a colonial
people.
For instance, the Union Jack is not
the Queen’s personal standard. It is the
flag of Great Britain. Llapping it
should have nothing to do with our
being the Queen’s Australian subjects.
The Australian flag is good enough for
that purpose. The Union Jack is simply
a flag like the Stars and Stripes or,
for that matter, the Red Llag that
you can string up on your flagpole if
you happen to like the nation con-
cerned or if you happen to be enter-
taining one of its representatives.
In the same way “God Save the
Queen” is not the Queen’s personal
song. It is the national anthem of Great
Britain, and it would seem to show
more respect than disloyalty to the
Queen of Australia if we had, as the
Canadians do, a distinctive tune of our
own. As Mr. Gorton rightly said last
week, we have “Waltzing Matilda,”
and let’s hope that by the next Olympic
Games we won’t be ashamed of it.
The future relations of Australia and
Britain are important enough to Aus-
tralia and are already sufficiently con-
fused, for it to be important for those
Australians who are the special
aficionados of Britain to begin to under-
stand that these relations are better
based on honesty than pretence. And
the same would seem to go for those
who want to continue to believe in a
Queen of Australia.
WHAT LIES BEHIND THE CLEAN SWEEP?
Comment by Alan Reid
THE HOLT ERA was a continuation
of the Menzies ♦ reign, but the Gorton
regime is something else entirely, a
distinct breakaway, and people prom-
inent in the Menzies and Holt adminis-
trations have either moved into the
background or been thrust there.
This may or may not be a good
thing. Only the future can determine
that. But Prime Minister John Gorton’s
differing concept of the role of a Prime
Minister from that of his two pre-
decessors is becoming increasingly
clearer.
Gorton’s approach seems to be Presi-
dential rather than Prime Ministerial.
He recognises the raw power of the
Liberal Parliamentary Party. It made
him Prime Minister. It could unmake
him. So he is careful to preserve the
loyalty of his parliamentary rank-and-
file followers. But, subject only to that
proviso and the necessity to maintain
an appealing image with the mass of
Australians whose votes determine the
outcome of elections, he behaves as
though his office has conferred upon
him not merely great power but com-
plete power.
This gives him the confidence to
confront simultaneously his fellow
Liberals, Premiers Bob Askin, of
N.S.W., and Sir Henry Bolte, of Vic-
toria (suspicious of his ‘‘centralist” ten-
dencies), the Liberal Party machine
(which believing in federalism is clearly
prepared to back the Premiers), the
mass of Liberal Party members (to
whom federalism is part of an inbred
mystique), ministerial survivors from
the Menzies and Holt days (who are
clearly apprehensive that he intends to
substitute one-man rule for shared
responsibility), and the Commonwealth
bureaucracy (for much of which he has
an impatient contempt),
Men2ies and Holt believed that good
government emerged from adjusting to
or neutralising these other power
points. Gorton appears to believe that
he can g e t better government by over-
riding them. This attitude has produced
an a i r 0 f vacillation. For example,
there is the centralist line he took in
Commonwealth-State relations, and the
indication he gave that he had a prefer-
ence for the “Fortress Australia” con-
cept G f defence. On these subjects Gor-
ton was quite willing to take strong
lines. But he immediately came up
against ether power points. Neither the
Premiers, the Liberal Party machine,
nor seemingly the great 'mass of the
Liberal Party members agreed with his
blueprint for Commonwealth-State
relations. He was compelled to make a
partial retreat. On “Fortress Australia”
he came up against a contrary view in

Cabinet and again he had to make a
partial retreat.
Now it is not without significance that
on Gorton’s personal staff there is only
one survivor from the Menzies-Holt
period—Mr. Tony Eggleton, who was
first Menzies’, then Holt’s, and now
Gorton’s Press officer. But for Eggleton,
there has been a clean sweep.
What intrigues many Liberal parlia-
mentarians, including some of the most
senior men in the Party, is where, pre-
cisely, Gorton turns to for his advice.
On the official side, the adviser is
easy to identify. Sir John Bunting, who
was the major public-service adviser to
Sir Robert Menzies and the late Harold
Holt, has gone to the Cabinet secre-
tariat. In his place as head of the
Prime Minister’s Department is Mr.
Len Hewitt, a former Treasury official.
The relationship here is close and
intimate. Unlike Sir John Bunting, who
worked out of the Prime Minister’s
Department, Hewitt works from an
office adjoining the Prime Minister’s
room at Parliament House whenever
Gorton is in Canberra. Hewitt is also
reported to be present at almost all
official consultations between Gorton
and individual Ministers.
But ministerially the advisers in
the broad sense of the word are
hard to identify. Treasurer William
McMahon, as Deputy Leader of the
Liberal Party, undoubtedly has access
to Gorton, and, as Treasurer, must be
consulted on technical matters. But
there is no indication that his advice
is taken on wider matters. It is diffi-
cult to see McMahon, who is a realist,
advising ■ Gorton other than against a
head-on clash with Askin and Bolte
on Commonwealth-State financial rela-
tions.
External Affairs Minister Paul Has-
luck, whose advice Menzies valued
highly, has almost disappeared into the
background. Gorton is highly suspicious
of External Affairs Department advice,
and makes no secret of his suspicion.
Gorton appears to have a regard for
Defence Minister Allen Fairhall. He is
reported to treat Fairhall views with
respect in the Cabinet. But, as their
public speeches clearly reveal, they do
not see defence problems through the
same eyes, with Fairhall anti-“ Fortress
Australia” and a supporter of the “For-
ward Defence” concept.
National Development Minister
David Fairbairn, though a Gorton
supporter from the outset in the leader-
ship struggle after Holt’s death, does
not appear to be consulted on anything
outside his Department, and Labor
Minister Les Bury does not emerge.
Some of the lesser Liberal lights, who
are known to be personally friendly
with Gorton, are credited with being
his major advisers, but this could be
wrong. In private conversation, they
profess themselves as puzzled as anyone
as to whom Gorton is turning for
advice.
Gorton is reported to have said
recently that there will be quite a few
disappearing from the Cabinet “at the
earliest opportunity.”


AUSTRALIA
John Gorton’s critical
two weeks
WHEN HIS fellow Liberal parliamen-
tarians voted Mr. Gorton into the
position of Prime Minister just ten
months ago they did so because they
thought he would provide leadership.
They looked at the obvious candidates
first. In Mr. McMahon they recognised
dynamism and dedication, but they gave
in to Mr. McEwen’s opposition. In
Mr. Hasluck they saw great intellect
and wisdom but a stodgy style and
a past record of ivory-towerism. In
John Gorton they knew they were
taking a risk on his inexperience. But
they thought they had a man with a
capacity for clarity of thought and
boldness. In short, they thought they
were getting a man of action.
In some ways he has lived up to
their expectations. He has often acted
decisively and boldly. He has initiated
thoroughgoing investigations into health
and social welfare and, when his Minis-
ters failed him, on oil-pricing, he
stepped in, mastered the subject, and
boldly declared his policy. He has
resisted the campaigns of lobby groups
to stop tariff reform, and he has talked
nationalism. His colleagues will critic-
ise him on the detail of many of these
domestic maters. But the extent of
their dissatisfaction on these issues is
no threat to him. They think he can
have his fights with the Liberal State
Premiers, and ponder the “philosophy”
of Federalism without doing more than
shake up the Liberal Party itself. No
one much else cares.
But Mr. Gorton’s colleagues are vir-
tually unanimous in expressing deep
distrust of his activities in the realm
of foreign affairs and defence. “John
Gorton might go much sooner than you
think,” a senior Minister told The Bulle-
tin last week. “He simply cannot con-
tinue as Prime Minister if the handling
of foreign policy doesn’t radically
improve.” The next two weeks will be
quite critical as a test of Mr. Gorton,
because they will represent something
of a climax. After at least five post-
ponements and 12 weeks’ delay, he is
finally meeting with his Cabinet to dis-
cuss the Defence and External Affairs
Departments’ strategic reassessment, an
80-page survey of the context in which
defence policy now needs to be framed.
He is then committed to a statement.
Meanwhile, he is being subjected to an
across-the-board assault by the Labor
Party, though this is probably helping
more than hindering him, since it is
likely to be rallying Government Mem-
bers and giving them self-confidence
through providing a reminder that they
aren’t the only ones in a mess.
Mr. Gorton got into trouble in
foreign policy from the beginning. He
smarted with a beautifully contrived
anti-climax: the postponement of a
nationwide TV address so that he could
consider Singapore Prime Minister
Lee i Kuan Yew’s request to accompany
him to London, followed by the lame
decision not to go. After that, he con-
tinued to make a point of saying what
Australia could not do: Australia
couldn’t possibly contribute more in
Vietnam (timed for the peak of the
Viet Cong Tet offensive), it wouldn’t
help South Korea again (when the
North Koreans looked most belligerent),
it couldn’t fill the British vacuum in
the Malaysia/Singapore area. And, most
insistently, he reiterated that Australia
couldn’t spend much money on defence
because it was a small country and
needed to do a lot of developing.
In off-the-cuff speeches and occasional
Press conferences he seemed to revel in
reeling off phrases: defence was an
insurance policy, Australia needed an
Israeli-type army, we should question
the concept of forward defence, we
should think, perhaps, of a fortress
Australia.
People attempting to get at the guts
of Prime Ministerial thinking were kept
in a constant state of agitation by his
failure to make any careful definitive
statements. And no sooner had one of
his phrases evoked an idea of what he
was getting at than it was dissolved by
denials and retractions and qualifications.
The Press conference at Blair House
in Washington on May 28 was probably
a crisis point. There Mr. Gorton pub-
licly admitted that he didn’t have a clue
about the operation of the ANZUS
Treaty. He didn’t do much better in
his follow-up tour in South-East Asia.
On June 20 he put a halt to the slide
in confidence by putting the stamp of
his authority on a paper called “The
Strategic Basis,” prepared each year in
the Defence Department but which was
being expanded and revised because of
the accelerated British withdrawal.
Speaking confidently from an unusually
carefully prepared text at the National
Press Club in Canberra he said: “There
has been a fundamental change in the
basis on which Australia’s strategic
planning has for more than two decades
been predicated . . . clearly a concpt
of forward defence by troops stationed
outside Australia, valid when based
upon participation with the forces of a
major power, needed minute examina-
tion ... I asked that our Defence
Committee should prepare a new
strategic reassessment, a new strategic
appreciation, taking into account those
fundamental changes which had
occurred.” He said he expected to get
the strategic reassessment by August at
Liberal Party president Pagan with the
Prime Minister
the latest and that “it will probably be
toward the end of the year before some
new three-year program, to be operated
from mid-1969, will be able responsibly
to be brought down.”
For the time being that stilled the
doubts. The Prime Minister appeared
to have recognised the need for
rethinking and readjustment of policies,
but the schedule increasingly got fouled
up. In the throes of reorganisation and
lacking direction, the Defence Depart-
ment was confused and repetitive in its
work on the strategic reassessment. It
is said by Ministers to have finally
turned up a rather banal and unhelpful,
if eminently sensible, document. But it
wasn’t very late, only a fortnight. And
copies were distributed to Cabinet late
in August. The real snags, however,
were encountered in Cabinet. At first
Ministers kept finding reasons some
good, some bad for leaving the
country; then, whenever they tried to
talk to Mr. Gorton about it they found
he viewed defence through his own
phrases and had rigidly preconceived
and often contradictory conceptions;
then he insisted in his many impromptu
speeches around the country in throwing
off generalisations about defence which
tended to put hard constraints on future
policy.
For instance, at Maitland on Sep-
tember 30 he said: “We find ourselves
in a completely changed world situa-
tion ... we ourselves must protect our-
selves, and this calls for resources which
I do not myself wish or like to give . . .
but which must be diverted if we are
in the changed situation of the world
to be able to take the first brunt of an
attack which, in the future, may fall
upon us . . .” From this we had a pic-
ture of continental defence.
Then, at a Mornington Liberal Party
luncheon on October 14, the Cabinet
was informed of the amount it would
be spending on defence: “We must
devote more and more, not of our gross


national product but more and more
toward building up our defences.”
On October 18, at a dinner at Terri-
gal, we had the financial dimensions of
defence reconfirmed, but the objectives
of defence were tentatively enlarged
to: “We must cement our relations with
the U.S. under the ANZUS Pact, we
must see what we can do to maintain
the stability of those nations to our
north, and third we must contribute to
our own capacity for our own defence
more of our resources than we have
ever had to contribute before.”
In the evening at an open party
meeting at Bundoora on November 10
he declarejl, “We must keep up the
enormous expansion of resources for
our own defence as an insurance policy.
If we are with some measure of safety
to own what we have and progress in
the way that is possible.”
During all this time the strategic
reassessment was stuck away in minis-
terial safes and briefcases, and only this
week is it being considered in Cabinet.
So by now the prospect is not even
bright that the Government can make
a definitive statement before the end
of the year on the strategic basis of
Australia’s defence policy. And there is,
of course, now no prospect whatever of
any new three-year program being
announced. In fact it is now almost
certain that the three-year planning will
be abandoned.
NATIONALITY
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
MOST AUSTRALIANS never think
about their citizenship. They just take it
for granted that they are “Australians,”
so that when they fill out a census form
or apply for a passport it comes as a
shock to find that they are really British
subjects, and only incidentally Austra-
lian citizens.
This situation arose when the 1947
Nationality and Citizenship Act, drawn
up after a Commonwealth Conference
on Citizenship, declared that all persons
born in Commonwealth countries had
the common status under Australian law
of “British subject.” People born in
Australia would also be “Australian
citizens,” but this was a secondary status.
Immigration Minister Billy Snedden
told the House of Representatives last
week that the Government had now
decided to change this, but would not
do away with the dual status. Instead,
the Government, in Snedden’s words,
will “give primacy to the status of Aus-
tralian citizens.” \
To do this, the Government will
amend the Citizenship Act to allow
Australians to call themselves “Austra-
lian citizen” rather than “British sub-
ject” when filling out forms or applying
for passports. All Federal legislation
will be changed to confer rights and
privileges (such as voting or joining
the public service) on an “Australian
citizen and British subject,” instead of
just “British subject.” The Common-
Snedden ... Australian citizen, British
subject
wealth hopes the States will follow suit
in amending all their legislation.
The Government decided on this
reversal of status following an extensive
review of citizenship by Mr. Snedden’s
Immigration Department, who found
that immigrants were greatly puzzled to
find themselves British subjects after
having taken out Australian citizenship.
And more and more Australians were
complaining about having to call them-
selves a “British subject” when describ-
ing their nationality.
But, while declaring an Australian
nationality would have required only
the stroke of a pen, the Government
decided against it. One reason was the
belief, as Mr. Snedden put it, that “the
status of British subject is very import-
ant to the great majority of the Aus-
tralian public, who would wish that
status to be retained.” Another reason
was that the Government believed that
declaring an Australian nationality
might put off British immigrants, who,
now, because they are also “British sub-
jects,” have the same rights as Aus-
tralians immediately on arrival.
Instead, Mr. Snedden decided simply
to reverse the present order of status,
putting the emphasis on Australian
citizenship rather than on British
subjecthood. This puts up no barriers
to British immigration, while appeasing
the nationalistic streak amongst Austra-
lians. As one Government member
summed it up: “What this does is allow
John Gorton to call himself an Austra-
lian citizen and Leslie Bury to call him-
self a British subject.”
THE F 111
NOT UNTIL 1969?
A NEW BOUT of controversy is about
to develop around the F-111 project as
a number of parliamentarians initiate
inquiries with the Government. Back-
benchers in the Liberal Party, as well as
Labor and DLP men, are involved.
This further questioning is being
prompted by a series of recent events.
The first follows U.S. Defence Secre-
tary Clifford’s proposal to cut USAF
orders and, probably, increase the cost
of each Fill. Another is the return to
Australia of pilots sent to the U.S. to
pick up Australia’s 24 planes, and the
inability of manufacturers to name any
new delivery date. Another is that the
aircraft was originally supposed to be
able to fly off short runways like those
of an aircraft-carrier, yet last week it
was announced that Amberley Airfield
had to be lengthened from 8000 ft. to
10,000 ft. to take the F-11l safely
through training flights.
The Bulletin was told last week on
very good authority that all the F-llls
so far built will have to be “completely
stripped down and rebuilt.” The prob-
lem is that the basic structure of the
plane is weak. In 1964 the manufac-
turers found that their prototypes were
far too heavy and went in for a
thorough weight-reducing exercise. But
now it looks to many experts as though
they pared the basic structural com-
ponents of the aircraft too fine, so that
they do not have the strength to carry
the loads imposed by extended flight.
The heart of the structure of the plane
is the “wing carrythrough,” a box-like
section which links the pivoting wings
to the body. It is being taken cut and
strengthened because of signs of failure.
A number of other basic parts evidently
need to be modified.
The exact number of modifications is
not yet known, because testing is pro-
ceding, but it is clear that each plane
will now have to be dismantled and the
new and modified parts inserted. Planes
will not be reassembled for many
months. It is now being guessed that
the planes may not be ready before the
end of 1969.
A problem with the replacement of
basic structural parts is that it runs the
aircraft back to the problems which the
original weight-paring was designed to
overcome: lack of range and bomb-
carrying capacity. So that, while made
safer, it may be made less useful.
One senior expert in the defence area
in Canberra disputed that the problem
revealed in fatigue-testing was due to
excess stress, but said it was probably a
metallurgical problem. The steel used
in the structural members is a high-
tensile type which is very difficult to
work—to drill or cut or form. The
initial crack around a bolt hole could
be reproduced anywhere else in the
structure where similar holes were
drilled. The expert said there was a
possibility the problem of the F-11l was
like that of Melbourne’s King Street
Bridge, an ominous analogy.


SCIENTOLOGY
THREE-STATE CONFLICT
SCIENTOLOGISTS appear to create
more and more libertarian issues as
their enemies, finding their practices
anything from distasteful to dangerous,
attempt to stop them and, if possible,
stamp them out. In South Australia
last week a Legislative Council move
to censure one scientologist led to pro-
test resignations from a Select Commit-
tee and an MLA’s use of a term often
used by cult members.
A Scientology Prohibition Bill which
received its second reading in the South
Australian Legislative Council some
seven weeks ago has been referred to a
Select Committee comprising three
Government and two Opposition mem-
bers. Their task, to investigate and
report on what measures, if any, were
needed to protect the public from
scientology. The Select Committee was
expected to produce its report and
recommendations this week. The Bill
itself had been strongly criticised by
the Labor Opposition on the grounds
that it threatened the ordinary private
rights of citizens, and these criticisms
to a large extent forced the formation
of the Select Committee. Last week
the issues surrounding the possible ban-
ning of the cult arose again when a
committee witness was summoned
before the Bar of the Legislative Coun-
cil and severely reprimanded.
The witness, Mr. Eric Klaebe, was
alleged to have written a letter to the
chairman of the Select Committee,
Roads Minister Hill, claiming that Mr.
Hill was not impartial. “I have to warn
you,” said the president, Sir Lyell
McEwin, “that in the opinion of this
House the letter you wrote and sent
was highly improper conduct.” He
went on to say that Members, when
engaged on official duties, are obliged
to speak as they think fit. “But when
speaking as members of a Select Com-
mittee, they are under strict duty to be
impartial, and invariably discharge this
duty.”
Although the ferment was of his
creation, Mr. Klaebe played a very
small part in the proceedings. Having
been summoned by Black Rod to
answer formal questions about his
identity and authorship of the letter,
he was asked to retire while the Cham-
ber decided what action to take. A
motion put by Sir Henry Rymill that
Klaebe be censured was carried on a
14 to four Party line vote.
The following day the Council was
subject to widespread criticism for its
actions. In the Assembly the Labor
Member for Edwardston, Mr. Virgo,
described the Council as a “kangaroo
court.” More restrained, but no less
serious, Opposition Leader Dunstan
said that Legislative Council Members
had chosen to deal with a man by con-
demning him without charge or without
hearing him in his own defence, and
that “this is completely contrary to
natural justice.”
The two Labor members of the Select
Gillman (1.). .. daring Victoria to
prosecute
Committee, Mr. Shard and Mr. Bevan,
then asked to be relieved of their Select
Committee duties on the grounds that
the continued inquiries of the Commit-
tee could serve no useful purpose, since
witnesses would now be reluctant to
state their views openly.
Speaking on the motion to discharge
the two Opposition Members from the
Committee, Chief Secretary Degaris
accused the Opposition in both Houses
of attacking the institution of Parlia-
ment itself. Referring to the resigna-
tion of Mr. Shard and Mr. Bevan, he
said that the only reason they had given
was that there had been interference
with civil rights, but “this House is
protecting the rights of Parliament, and
this is an essential part of human
rights.” Following the election by
ballot of two new Committee mem-
bers, Mr. Shard spoke again and made
perhaps the most valuable comment on
the whole sorry affair. “In my humble
opinion,” he said, “the whole of the
standing orders in connection with
Select Committees and bringing people
before this House needs to be looked
at in the light of 1968 rather than the
1800 s.” Finally, there was last Friday’s
raid on scientology headquarters in
Perth.
Melbourne, meanwhile, was busy
with the assistant world executive secre-
tary of scientology, Mr. Peter Gillman,
last week. Sounding a little like a
character on the loose from . an
“Avengers” script, fie dared Sir Henry
Bolte to prosecute his outlawed
organisation, threatened to investigate
the backgrounds of several parliamen-
tarians, and claimed that he had
$2,000,000 to establish a “Church of
Scientology” in the “corrupt and
brutal” State which held a Royal Com-
mission on scientcflogy in 1965.
Gillman’s arrival came more than a
month after the first meeting of an
outer-suburban congregation of the
“church” was advertised by handbills
and in the Press. Members of Cabinet
were invited. Thus the initial publicity
given to the claims that scientology was
a religion and that the Government was
too frightened to prosecute were given
another good run in the media.
How scientologists can be aided by
the sudden recollection that they are a
church is not very clear. The Bill which
banned the practice in 1965 makes it an
offence to teach or apply scientology for
any kind of reward or to simply offer
to teach scientology. It is a blanket pro-
vision with a maximum of $2OO for a
first offence and $5OO for a second.
Possibly out of fear of not being able
to present a watertight case, the police
did not launch immediate prosecutions
after two raids of scientology meetings,
but there is no question of the Act
being invalid. State Parliaments have
the power to pass virtually any kind of
legislation, whether it interferes with
freedoms or not, and if there are loop-
holes in the Psychological Practices
Act they will, according to Mr. Dickie,
the Health Minister, soon be closed.
UNIVERSITIES
ANGRY POSTGRADUATES
THE FORMATION of the National
Research Students’ Association in Mel-
bourne recently has thrown some
attention on to the neglected field of
researching the nation’s research. A
report released by the Australian
Industrial Research Group in August
gave some idea of the numbers of
people engaged in Australian research
and development and the amount of
money spent, but to date there has
been no attempt by any institution or
Government Department to investigate'
the overall administration of Aus-
tralian postgraduate research, and no
inquiry into its needs or into the
diverse thinking of the various bodies
involved.
The situation as seen through the
eyes of many postgraduate students is
depressing, if not calamitous, said Mr.
Chris Ryan, the interim national presi-
dent of the Research Students’ Associa-
tion and doctoral student in Mel-
bourne’s Physics School, “No one seems
to be basing his assessments on any
solid understanding of the needs of
the universities or the needs of the
country.” Pie paused and then added:
“It may be that the Federal and State
Governments are actually afraid of pro-
ducing too many postgraduate stu-
dents.” Mr. Ryan was speaking in a
cubicle formed by packing-case par-
titions.
The causes of discontent at Mel-
bourne in particular are many. Cut-,
backs in certain sections of the
university's general expenditure, and a
drastic trimming of postgraduate and
research funds, have meant that during
the present triennium postgraduate
research and undergraduate teaching
are a pale shadow of vigorous life and
no more.
Researchers spend costly months,
even years, building equipment or mak-


ing supplies before they can get down
to their experiments. Attempted
economies have thus led to indirect
extravagance as postgraduate grants
are extended far beyond the minimum
time so that the work can be finished.
Books and materials are in scarce
supply, and of the few sections that are
still financially comfortable, several are
well off because of American grants.
The general absence of money has
also made Melbourne’s claims for
regard as a research centre fairly
tenuous. Brilliant individuals cannot
prevent standards from falling when
many students leave for other univer-
sities, or, more importantly, when the
best researchers stay away. Fourth-
year students who once enjoyed SIOOO
grants now often have to spend time
away from research working in order
to live.
While the standards are threatened
and the numbers of postgraduates
remain virtually static instead of
increasing, under-graduate teaching has
also taken a tumble. There are few
tutorials in science subjects; none in
physics, first-year medicine, and veter-
inary science; none in second- and
third-year chemistry, etc. Arts depart-
ments and other faculties have in many
or most cases reduced the numbers of
tutorials and have converted them into
mini-lectures or seminars.
The main beef, however, of the
research students is based on the fear
that the Government, its adviser the
Australian Universities Commission,
and some universities have no clear
idea of what the others are planning,
if anything. This will be the main item
on the agenda when their national body
meets in February, for when the Mel-
bourne research people went to the
then Senator Gorton and Sir Henry
Bolte at the beginning of the triennium,
they discovered that they had pleaded
a case to the powers that be while the
university had unsuccessfully been try-
ing to do the same for weeks.
SUNDAY DRINKING
INSTANT DISSENSION
IN A YEAR. of State movements
toward liberalisation, most of them
halted by sudden political uncertainties,
the one related to easing Sunday liquor
laws has troubled politicians most.
There are too many other considera-
tions tied in with it. Last week, its hot-
potato nature was most evident in
Queensland and New South Wales,
where it caused instant dissension in
Government Parties.
Queensland allows Sunday liquor
sales outside a 40-mile radius from
Brisbane and began a review of current
regulations at a combined Government
Members’ meeting in September, when
Justice Minister Dr. Delamothe was
asked to prepare submissions. These
were discussed a month later at a meet-
ing which only 19 out of 47 Members
attended. The 19 voted against allowing
hotels within the 40 miles to open on
Sundays, but approved liberalisations
for restaurants, motels, and clubs.
But when Country Party Premier
Bjelke-Petersen returned from the inter-
national sugar talks more recently, his
weight went pro status quo. On Mon-
day last week a Cabinet meeting dis-
cussed liquor reform and the Premier
intimated that he found too much
division and dissension on all parts of
the issue, so the restaurants, clubs,
motels, and “inner” hotels would have
to wait for a time of calm such as
after the next State election.
Much the same thing had been hap-
pening, at much the same time, in
New South Wales. A- special committee
had been set up by Justice Minister
Maddison, and its report had been
turned in, but had not been debated
by Cabinet. The present N.S.W. law
permits bona fide travellers to drink on
Sundays, usually if and where service
is offered, and it was believed that the
committee had recommended some
further liberalisation, with Mr. Maddi-
son in favor.
Last week, however, Transport
Minister Morris foreshadowed equal
disageement and dissension in N.S.W.
when he brought up an increasing road
toll as the main reason for his opposi-
tion. “I believe there will be an increase
in consumption by motorists if Sunday
trading comes in,” he said.
This might have been taken as an
indication that Sunday-liquor sales
would fade as an issue in N.S.W., but
one of Sydney’s competing afternoon
newspapers, the “Sun,” decided to
ginger up the debate with a straw-vote
of its readers. Announced quietly last
Tuesday, this made a sensational front-
page story two days later when the
“Sun” headlined, “Big Money to Rig
Our Sunday Drinking Poll.” Someone
had ordered 25,000 copies from one
newsagent, presumably with the idea
of ticking off 25,000 “Yes” or “No”
votes and dropping the coupons in the
box handily provided. So, reluctantly,
the “p°l]” had to be cancelled and the
Government left unswayed.
In Melbourne, meanwhile, the Vic-
torian Government was proceeding
toward liberalisation in its own way
last week by passing a Bill through the
Legislative Assembly to circumvent a
loophole in the law, which permitted
anyone to take their own liquor into,
say, a milk bar to drink it with their
malteds. That, at least, was how its
effect had been generally publicised,
but only after its passage through the
Assembly did someone note that it had
also removed a “small harmless con-
cession,” the right to take one’s own
wine or beer into an unlicensed
restaurant.
THE WEST
WHO PAID THE $428?
A THREAT OF a general strike in
Western Australia last week ended in a
way that had unionists hopping mad.
The big blow-up became a fizz. Seven
boilermakers, fined for having gone on
strike, refused to pay their $6O fines
and threatened, instead, to go to jail
for 30 days and martyr themselves. After
their case had been fanned into an
emotive business, and the Trades and
Labor Council had threatened to call
out all unionists in the State if the men
were jailed, a phantom “benefactor”
went along and deposited $428.28 . . .
and it was all over.
There is some likelihood that further
industrial unrest will be stirred up by
the mysterious payment, even though it
is felt in some circles that a union might
well have been behind it; the unions
were far from united about the pros-
pects of a general strike, which would
have embarrassed some of them. But the
prospect of everyone being called out
was important enough to be a factor in
bringing ACTU executive metal group
representative Mr. J. Devereux back to
Australia from Europe, where he was
investigating ways of training skilled
workers. And in Britain and Europe,
Western Australia could not afford to
have its name muddied as an industrially
ruthless State, depending as it does on
migrants to ease the drastic shortage of
skilled labor.
Who was the phantom fine-payer? “A
Government agency could have done it
to ward off prospects of a strike,” says
Mr. Frank Bastow, secretary of the
Left-wing Boilermakers and Blacksmiths’
Society. “An employer could have paid
the fines for the same reason.” Or per-
haps, Mr. Bastow suggested, the Govern-
ment and employers could have been in
Maddison (l.), uncertain;
Bjelke-Petersen (c.), “no”;
Morris (r.), unswayed

Government and the Employers’ Federa-
tion denied vigorously.
The penal provisions of the Act have
been in force since 1912, although they
were repealed and re-enacted in a
slightly tougher form in 1952. Western
Australia has a grim distinction as the
only State where the individual as well
as the union can, be fined, with jail in
default of a fine, for striking unlawfully.
(Employers add that the same provisions
apply to management that stages a lock-
out unlawfully.)
Not only has it taken all this time
for the legislation to be led toward its
ultimate test, but it has taken seven
imported Britons to do it—an English-
man, an Irishman, a Welshman, and
four Scotsmen, all boilermakers at
Kwinana. As the Welshman put it:
“What would my friends in Port Talbot
think when they hear that David Jones,
the boy from Maesteg, is in prison
because he believes in the right to strike?
I’ll tell you what they’ll bloody well
think. They’ll think that it’s a rum
country that can impose a penal clause
on trade-union workers.”
The “Determined Seven’s” strike
began during a rush order at J. W.
Storer Engineering in June, when the
foreman picked up tools and welded
stainless steel pipes; previously boiler-
maker Tom Cortis, who had just
finished his apprenticeship, had been
sacked, and this helped build up bad
relations.
There is a substantial backlog of
bitterness in Western Australian union-
ism, not only over these penal clauses
but over the unions’ inability or unwill-
ingness to act against them. The State
is at a vulnerable stage with labor.
Colossal developments are under way, or
soon to begin, that need skilled workers
in an atmosphere of industrial harmony.
The mysterious payment of a fine has
avoided a showdown immediately, but
the frustration and anger it has added to
a situation already loaded is simply a
guarantee that when the showdown
comes it will be a big one.
CANBERRA
POLLUTED LAKE?
ALTHOUGH former Government
Senate Leader Sir Denham Henty is no
longer in politics, people in Australia’s
cities may eventually be thankful for his
interest in air and water pollution. Two
Senate Committees which he instigated
were in the news last week, as they
probed and questioned, trying to find
where the “dirt” is. One Committee
asked just how polluted is Canberra’s
$5 million “ornamental” Lake Burley
Griffin, but only came away more
confused than before. Still, the Com-
mittee may eventually find out, though
whether the public who are con-
tinually warned against swimming in
the lake—will ever know is doubtful.
The Health Department and the
National Capital Development Com-
mission resumed their interdepart-
mental wrangling on whether the lake
is safe or not at the Committee’s first
public hearing. Medical officer of the
Health Department Dr. Martin
“Mich” Ryan tried hard to get the
message over that the lake is polluted.
The Health Department has warned
against swimming in the lake since it
was filled in 1964, mainly because of
effluent from the HMAS Harman Naval
station and the Queanbeyan Sewage
Works. Strangely, neither the Works
nor Navy Departments have any plans
to stop Harman’s discharges entering
the lake. Nor has Queanbeyan Council.
Dr. Ryan was expected to throw new-
light on the effluent problem, particu-
larly as the Department expected the
NCDC to play down the question of
pollution. But the submission said noth-
ing more than: “The degree of con-
tamination (in the lake) is not
uniformly high but it could consti-
tute a risk to health if people were to
swi'm repeatedly in the lake . . .
“The important factor about lake
contamination is not the measure so
much as the nature of it.” The submis-
Sir Denham Henty ... air and water
pollution
sion went on that there was a risk of
transmission of “bacterial, viral, and
parasitic infections, especially of the
gastro-intestinal and respiratory tracts.”
The Department’s last card was the
result of the bacteria tests carried out-
on lake water. Dr. Ryan said the
Department had no objection to releas-
ing these to the Committee but not
the public. They were “difficult” to
interpret and could create “adverse
public reaction.” Did this mean the
pollutant level was so high that, if
revealed, it would create a public
outcry?
Dr. Ryan did not say. But the
NCDC’s First Assistant Commissioner,
Clive Price, said the Commission
viewed things differently from Health.
The tests showed contamination of the
lake was within acceptable standards.
With proper controls and regular test-
ing, the lake could be swum in “with
complete confidence.”
The committee plans a meeting in
camera in the near future to consider
the Health Department’s bacteria tests.
Then the Senators at least, if not the
public, should know just how polluted
is the lake.

INTERNATIONAL
Slowing down to a ceasefire in Vietnam
THE BEGINNING of the end of the
confrontation between large units of
the American and North Vietnamese
armies in the northern half of South
Vietnam 'has begun. The first unravel-
ling came half-perceptibly last week
when the American c o ,m m a n d
announced that elements of the Ist Air
Cavalry division were being moved
southward from the suburbs of Hue,
where it had been the “swing force”
reserve for the defence of the northern
region, to the Cambodian border north-
west of Saigon.
Officially, General Abrams made
plans to move the division before the
breakthrough in the peace talks in Paris.
Officially, too, his motive was the
growing threat along the Cambodian
border near Saigon. But then, on
November 11 Armistice Day the
American command terminated the
14-month-long Operation Wheeler-
Wallowa and the seven-month-long
Operation Burlington Trail, in which
two American brigades claim to have
killed 12,000 Communists, and made
arrangements to move these two
brigades, too. Taken together, these
moves seem to be the first adjustment
of the battlefield to the broad shape of
an agreement between Hanoi and Wash-
ington for step-by-step de-escalation,
disengagement, and an indirect cease-
fire.
South Vietnamese officers in a posi-
tion to know report that General
Abrams has advised and the South
Vietnamese have agreed that
offensive operations in the northern
half of the country near the borders
should be reduced, and that allied
forces should be pulled back into major
base areas or enclaves while they
see whether the Communists abide by
the “understanding” to reduce the scale
of the war. “If the Communists begin to
re-escalate, we’ll escalate twice as
strongly,” one Vietnamese officer said.
This tacit de-escalation, now under
way in its first stages, is probably only
indirectly related to the deal for the
end of the bombing of North Vietnam.
It seems to be more directly and pre-
cisely related to reports that secret
arrangements have been made in Laos
for a gradual and proportionate with-
drawal of American and North Viet-
namese troops from the south. While
the secret arrangement is still broad
in outline and general in the degree
of commitment offered by both sides,
it does include some specific sugges-
tions for the regrouping of troops into
enclaves before their withdrawal. The
American and North Vietnamese
Ambassadors to Laos, Mr. William
Sullivan and Mr. Le Van Hien,
reportedly led the shaping of this plan.
U.S. Defence Secretary Clark Clifford
... his tone and language shocked Saigon
And last week’s moves suggest that
it is beginning to go into operation.
The final, formal agreement on the
concurrent withdrawal of North Viet-
namese and American troops is
thought to be one of the first items
of substantive discussion on the agenda
of the Paris peace talks with or
without the representation of the
reluctant Saigon Government. In his
speech last week, Mr. Clark Clifford,
the American Defence Secretary,
explicitly said that productive talks
could be continued between the United
States and North Vietnam for a
“military arrangement” even without
the presence of the South Vietnamese
delegation in Paris.
Mr. Clifford’s speech intensified the
fear in Saigon that the Americans are
in a hurry to liquidate their part in
the war, even if it means forfeiting
their commitments to keep South Viet-
nam viable and partly non-Communist.
Many South Vietnamese, listening to
the radio broadcast, were shocked by
Mr. Clifford’s tone and language.
Western diplomats were stunned. But
the most startling reaction came in the
American community, which was
equally flabbergasted and even more
chagrined.
The “understanding” of the actions
North Vietnam was supposed to refrain
from in exchange for the end of
the bombing of the north seems to have
been so quickly and flimsily worked
out that even x'esponsible American
and South Vietnamese officials are still
in the dark about it. President Thieu
was reportedly told by the American
Ambassador that North Vietnam had
agreed to call off “ground attacks and
shellings” on “major cities.” The
Ambassador, Mr. Banker, is said to
have included the 44 provincial capitals
as v major cities. But the American
military command admits that it has
not been given any classification from
Washington.
South Vietnamese officials, who
claim that the shellings of district
capitals are a violation of the under-
standing and they have counted
more than 30 since November I—are
becoming increasingly angry with both
the Communists and the Americans.
The anxiety and fear of betrayal in
South Vietnam are growing.
KOREA
SIEGE OF THE SOUTH
By DENNIS BLOODWORTH
THE STEALTHY landing of 60 armed
Com,munist killers on the coast south-
east of Seoul has served warning on
Washington that a threat of peace in
Vietnam may provoke a threat of war
in Korea.
This has been the biggest band of
terrorists to be infiltrated into the South
from the Communist North since
January, when the hard core of a gang
of 31 guerillas sent to assassinate Presi-
dent Park Chung Hee were intercepted
and wiped out within gunshot of his
palace in the capital. In the ten months
between these two intrusions, the South
Koreans say they have killed nearly
300 North Korean infiltrators armed
with explosives and automatic weapons
and have suffered an equal number of
casualties in dead and wounded in more
than 250 clashes.
The United States informed the
United Nations Security Council in
October that violations of the ceasefire
line in Korea had reached a “dangerous
level,” and accused the Co,mmunists
of moving not only men but tanks and
assault guns into the 150-mile-long
demilitarised zone that has separated
Communist North from anti-Communist
South for 16 years.
In October, 1966, Premier Kim II
Sung, of North Korea, declared that
the campaign for the unification of the
two halves of the country .must be
switched from political subversion to
direct military action, and the number
of gunfights between the UN security
forces and do-or-die squads of armed
infiltrators rose alarmingly almost at
once. Now he has reportedly set 1970


as the deadline for fusing North and
South.
At the moment, the Americans are
tied down in Vietnam and so are 50,000
crack South Korean troops. If Kim II
Sung waits too long, the war in Vietnam
may end, releasing a formidable Ameri-
can fighting machine for use, if neces-
sary, in Korea, and the unpredictable
Nixon, who reputedly regards hi’m as
an unfettered Stalinist menace, will be
firmly installed in the White House.
The possibility of a full-scale attack
on South Korea may seem unthinkable
but cannot be discounted. Some com-
fort may be drawn from the coolness
between Pyongyang and Peking, where
the Maoist advocates of “wars of libera-
tion” almost ignored the 20th anniver-
sary of the Korean People’s Republic
in September. Kim has obliquely
attacked the Chinese by urging that
one aim of Communism must be to
produce the “happy life” (which all
decent Maoists abhor) and by describing
over-emphasis on the class struggle as
a “Leftist error.” On the other hand,
he has criticised the Russians over
Czechoslovakia, but stressed that Com-
munist Parties should not interfere in
each other’s affairs, evidently angling
for Soviet support.
In September, Kim II Sung warned
that reunification must be preceded by
a “South Korean revolution,” relying
on the “powerful revolutionary base” in
the North. Many military observers
believe, however, that despite the
dispatch to South Korea of infiltrated
guerillas and agents who secretly distri-
bute leaflets urging the people to shelter
their “armed compatriots” from the
North, the staunchly anti-Co’mmunisL
South is proving poor soil for raising a
crop of “Viet Cong” locally and any
attempted insurrection would therefore
Be mounted only in support of a direct
thrust across the demilitarised zone.
In North Korea, where armed forces
nearly 400,000-strong include at least
15,000 men specially trained for
guerilla warfare, key factories are going
underground. Pyongyang is spending
nearly a third of the augmented
national budget on arms.
The South Koreans have more than
600,000 ,men under arms, supported by
about 50,000 American combat troops.
Very much alive to the threat across
the parallel, Washington has put some
$3O million into the elaboration of a sea-
to-sea barrier on the southern boundary
of the demilitarised zone. This already
includes a high chain-link fence pro-
tected by a system of minefields and
watchtowers, and a growing complex
of bunkers, tunnels, and concealed gun
positions converted in turn by a net
of night-detection radar devices.
There are 18 Korean and two Ameri-
can divisions in the “front line.” The
South Korean military man roadblocks
on all the main highways as part of a
defence mesh made up of civilian
militia, armed reservists, coast-watchers,
and the 50,000-strong police force.
South Korea is not yet a country under
attack. But it looks like a country under
siege.
MALAYSIA
CATCH OF BIG FISH
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
OVER THE past week 140 alleged
Communists, Communist sympathisers,
and front men have been arrested and
held in preventive detention in West
Malaysia. The initial arrests took place
in pre-dawn swoops on November 9
with subsequent ones in the days follow-
ing. The largest nu’mber was in Johore
(54), followed by Selangor (33) and
Penang (20). According to Deputy-
Prime Minister Tun Razak, the majority
of the people arrested were officials
and members of the Labor Party, while
a few were from the Partai Rakyat
and the trade unions —in the last
general elections the Partai Rakyat and
the Labor Party were combined in the
socialist front. One of the arrested was,
interestingly, a State assemblyman of
the north-eastern State of Kelantan, a
member of the Pan-Malayan Islamic
Party, which controls the State Govern-
ment. Tun Razak also disclosed that
there were 19 students among those
arrested, six of whom were expelled
students of Singapore Nanyang Univer-
sity, for long a hotbed of extreme
Left-wing agitation.
Judging from what the Prime Minis-
Gls (one on
the ground
and another
second from
right)
scuffling
with North
Koreans
outside
the
Korean
Armistice
Commission
at
Panmunjom
ter, Tunku Abdul Rahman, has been
saying, not all those who were sought
were arrested. The Tunku has not put
a figure on those who eluded the net,
but his use of the term “big fish” to
describe them suggests that they may
have been important. The Tunku has
also implied that perhaps those who
eluded detention somehow or other have
got wind of what was afoot.
Acco'mpanying the arrests the
Government issued a White Paper
entitled “The Path of Violence to Abso-
lute Power” —in which the Communists’
objectives and front activities are
described in detail. In his foreword to
the White Paper, Tun Razak asserts
that “a new form of threat has now
cast its sinister shadow over the nation.
Communist militancy has been taken into
thfe stage where all pretence at formal
compliance with constitutional require-
ments will be abandoned and Com-
munist united front activities will be
geared to the creation of conditions
favorable to the return of the Com-
'munist Party of Malaya along the
violent path to absolute power . . . the
Government has never hesitated in act-
ing firmly against those who knowingly
seek to destroy the democratic way of
life ... it will not hesitate now.”
Since the Kroh ambush on the Thai-
Malaysian border in June and the
related incidents at that time (see The
Bulletin, “Reds on the Hook,” June 29),
there have been no incidents such as to
suggest the imminence of the present
crack down, although in Singapore in
the past few weeks there have been some
incidents. There on two occasions Mao-
chanting youngsters have waylaid buses
in relatively remote areas at night and
have, after getting the passengers out,
set them on fire. This has made some
observers wonder if a wave of arrests
is also due in Singapore.
Meanwhile, on the whole the reaction
so far to the Malaysian arrests has been
restrained. Naturally the Labor Party
and the Partai Rakyat have pleaded
innocence, but have found little sym-
pathy in the columns of the Press. Dr.
Tan Chee Koon, on the other hand,
expressed what a lot of ordinary people
are no doubt thinking when he alleged
that the “Alliance Government has fol-
lowed a set path of reviving the. Com-
munist bogy whenever an election is
in the offing,” and acidly inquired what
sort of parliamentary democracy was
being defended when the Press got
copies of the White Paper but Members
of Parliament didn’t.
Tun Razak has denied that the arrests
and the elections are connected and the
Government has hastily announced that
a debate on the White Paper will be
held once Parliament meets for the
Budget session in January. But once
again, as these relatively small points
illustrate, the Alliance Government has
failed to make the best presentation of
its case and has seemingly still failed to
realise that where matters of preventive
detention are concerned, as the old
phrase has it, a Government is likely to
be damned if it does and damned if
it doesn’t.


RUSSIA
SEARCHING FOR FRIENDS
IN SOVIET EYES, Czechoslovakia has
become an unfinished business which
threatens to go on and on with no
viable solution in sight.
The grudging admission by Mr.
Brezhnev, the Soviet Party chief in
Warsaw, that the military invasion of
Czechoslovakia was “an extraordinary,
enforced step” reflects the great embar-
rassment in Moscow with the dilemma
which faces the Kremlin within the
Communist movement.
It is a serious matter for the Soviet
Union. The differences between the
Soviet and the Italian Com,munist
Parties remain unresolved after talks
in Moscow. A communique issued on
Friday in Moscow did not even mention
Czechoslovakia and describes the
atmosphere of the talks as frank and
comradely wdiich means sharp dif-
ferences.
The communique also omitted any
reference to the Soviet plan for a world
Comjnunist conference. It was due to
be held this month, but developments
connected with Czechoslovakia forced
a postponement.
The consultative meeting charged
with convening the conference met
again in Budapest on Sunday. It is
unlikely that there will be a conference
in the near future, since the Czech
question has brought up acute differ-
ences of opinion between Moscow and
other West European Communist
Parties.
The Italian Party, which is doggedly
pro-Czech, has a very influential fol-
lowing. Without its support, the
Russians will be unable to rally the
Western Parties to participate in the
conference.
On a similar note, the Soviet Party’s
intense efforts in recent years for a
rapprochement with the Japanese Com-
munist Party have also suffered a set-
back. There has been a very severely
worded exchange of polemics recently
between Party organs in Moscow and
Tokyo.
The Czech leader, Alexander Dubcek,
personifies the Soviet dilemma. The
Soviet leaders are uncertain about what
to do next.
They are no longer interested in
toppling Dubcek, since whoever suc-
ceeds him will be instantly discredited
in Czech eyes. Therefore, they cannot
act on the principle that he who is
falling must also be pushed.
Nevertheless, recent incidents in
Prague, with pro- and anti-Soviet
demonstrations clashing, are ugly omens
of the sickening atmosphere which can
prevail in Czechoslovakia under the
present stress.
The only solution for restoring a
measure of normality in East Europe
open to Moscow is to intensify economic
activity in the whole bloc and also to
pump funds into Czechoslovakia to
rescue its collapsing economy.
There is a new note of urgency in
this respect. It is significant that Mr.
Heading a Soviet delegation to the
Polish Communist Party Congress in
Warsaw last week, Russia’s Leonid
Brezhnev visited a steel mill and was
given a floppy hat and sunglasses
Brezhnev, in his speech to the Polish
Com’munist Party congress in Warsaw,
reverted to calling a summit meeting
of East European leaders to discuss
economic problems and planning.
While no end to the Czechoslovakia
crisis is yet in sight, Mr. Brezhnev’s
Warsaw speech underlines a new phase
in Soviet policy of wdiich the invasion
of Czechoslovakia was merely the
clumsy prologue. It is an end, for a
period at least, of Moscow’s acceptance
of plurality of views within the Com-
munist camp.
While it is not clear whether it is a
consequence of their action in Czecho-
slovakia or the other way around, it is
difficult to escape the conclusion that
it is the beginning of a deeper crisis in
Com'munist affairs.
NATO
GREAT DAY OF FAILURE
THE STORY OF the “breakdown of
communications” in NATO on August
21 the day the Russians invaded
Czechoslovakia —can now be told more
fully. The chapter of failures was
compendious.
It began, on the admission of high
NATO sources, as early as February,
when Western intelligence reported
indications that the Russians might
■move against Prague. These reports
came from American CIA agents in
Warsaw Pact countries and, to a lesser
extent, from the West German military
intelligence organisation, which retains
remnants of its wartime network in
East Europe. The information was
pooled and passed to some NATO
governments, but in London and Wash-
ington the politicians seized on the CIA
“appreciation” that the threat was in no
way directed against the West.
In Washington, President Johnson
was preoccupied with Vietnam and
hopes of concluding East-West arms-
control agreements including the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The
head of the United States Army Control
and Disarmament Agency, Mr. Foster,
is said to have been “in the ascendant”
and to have convinced him that moves
to deter the Russians would wreck these
hopes.
The next warning to NATO was on
April 12, when the Soviet newspaper
“Pravda” said the Czechs had been
warned about “anti-socialist elements”
who were trying to reintroduce multi-
party “liberalism.” Some well-placed
observers say this warning received no
discussion whatever within the political
organs of the alliance.
The next warning came with the
Warsaw Pact manoeuvres in Czecho-
slovakia in July. Military intelligence
sources told their political masters that
the manoeuvres could well be a recon-
naissance in force for a subsequent
march-in. But the matter was only
briefly discussed in the NATO Per-
manent Council, whose members
ambassadors had to refer every
question back to their tardy govern-
ments.
The alliance had still taken no deci-
sion about how to meet the Russian
threat, for example, by a collective
statement of its concern or by suggest-
ing an East-West security conference,
when Western intelligence was again
reporting Warsaw Pact military
preparations in early August. By the
middle of this month, the Russians had
reached the state of preparation in
wffiich, according to officers at SHAPE
(NATO Supreme Headquarters in
Europe) at the time, they could occupy
Prague in a couple of hours.
This masterly inactivity was directly
due to what British Defence Minister
Healey admitted last week to have
been a “certain failure of communi-
cations” within the alliance. “As the
crisis, developed in August,” he told
journalists at the Brussels NATO meet-
ing, “it revealed weaknesses in NATO
a failure in communications, not
only between governments themselves
but also between governments and the
military.”
But in addition to this failure in con-
sultation there was a straightforward
failure in the physical organisation of
the telecommunications network a
failure, as one high source put it,
“simply to get the information around.”
The fiasco became clear on the Wed-
nesday the Russians marched. At that
time many NATO ministers and
officials were on holiday, and in some
cases 'here was delay in establishing
contact with them. This was despite the
warnings of military officers that a
Soviet move against a Warsaw Pact
member could be used as a cover for
a surprise attack on the West.
It has even been suggested that
“vigilance” was ordered, instead of the
more stringent state of “alert,” because
the alert proved difficult to mount. For,
although the latter had been tested in
October in exercise “Fallex 68,” the


alert system as a whole had not been
refurbished since the Cuba missile
crisis of 1962.
It may well be that the communica-
tions failure was confined to certain
parts of the NATO alert system. It is
also certain that urgent steps are now
being taken to repair the gaps. But
there is another respect in which NATO
would have been caught seriously
unprepared if the Czech crisis had
developed into a threat to the West.
For two years the alliance has been
seeking to formulate a new “tactical
nuclear doctrine” to clarify the con-
ditions under which NATO forces
would resort to nuclear weapons in
the event of a Soviet attack. All mem-
bers agree that this indiscriminate use
of the 16,000 tactical warheads now
in Western Europe would produce
terrible casualties, mainly in West
Germany, and would destroy all
semblance of control on the battle-
field. Yet Mr. Healey and the German
Defence Minister, Herr Schroeder, who
have been charged with gathering up
various proposals (including the use
of nuclear “warning shots”), are still
working out “guide-lines” to put before
the appropriate NATO committee next
year.
It is said that the committee will
then have to formulate further, more
specific guide-lines before .these can
be put to the alliance as a whole for
the benefit of military planners in
peacetime and political chiefs in war.
It is argued, in mitigation of this delay,
that the continued uncertainty sur-
rounding NATO’s nuclear intentions
may frighten the Russians as much as
it frightens some NATO members. Yet
all NATO members have publicly
stressed that this kind of uncertainty,
which existed about the strategic
deterrent under Mr. Dulles, is likely to
detract from, rather than enhance, the
credibility of Western preparedness.
THE MISS WORLD COMPETITION
PROFITS, PRESTIGE,
AND POLITICS
SHE ARRIVED IN LONDON last
week dressed in a magnificent pastel
mink and matching hat. She is the
most famous woman in the history of
Peru and owns a chain of profitable
boutiques. Madelaine Hartog-Bel, Miss
World 1967, made the most of her
moment of glory.
Like her successor, Penelope Plum-
mer, of Australia, Miss Hartog-Bel is
part of a multi-million-dollar inter-
national industry. Even a small country
like Yugoslavia can spend $50,000
organising its qualifying competitions.
With over 60 countries taking part the
total costs certainly approach $6 million.
The sponsor, Mecca Ltd., gives the
proceeds to charity and claims to make
no direct cash out of the promotion.
The firm takes 25 percent of Miss
World’s earnings in management fees,
but this is unlikely to be more than
about $14,000. “We do it for the pub-
licity,” explains one of the directors,
happily adding, “it’s the most publicised
single event in the world.”
It may be, but no one seems clear
what this means for Mecca. For the
past three years profits have remained
virtually static. In 1967 profits before
tax declined 9 percent on 1966 to
$2,700,000. Perhaps more Miss Worlds
are needed.
But if Mecca makes no money
Penelope Plummer ... Australia’s con-
tribution to the politics of Miss World
directly out of the competition plenty
of other sponsors do. The qualifying
competitions are run by magazines,
newspapers, television stations, pro-
motional firms, and Government tourist
boards.
Miss Israel, who this year came
third, should prove a highly profitable
young lady for “Elasha,” the Israeli
women’s magazine. Debie Namir, a
brooding delegate hidden behind enor-
mous sunglasses, explained at the Miss
World gala night last week that
“Elasha” has the biggest weekly circu-
lation of any magazine in Israel.
“Miss Israel will help to double our
sales and raise the number of pages
frbm 60 to 84 for over four weeks.”
In Turkey, the competition is spon-
sored by “Milltyet,” the second-largest
newspaper, with a circulation of
300,000 copies daily. During the con-
test to elect Miss Turkey sales increased
by 2 percent and advertising revenue
by 1 percent. “Our woman readership
rises,” says Necdet Gumkut, on the
staff of the paper. “But it is not a com-
pletely commercial affair. We are doing
it partly for the prestige of Turkey,”
he adds.
Prestige and profits are the main
motives of those who run the national
competitions. Sometimes, after a gov-
ernment has seen how valuable the pub-
licity can be, it takes over the running
of the competition. Uganda, Nigeria,
and Ghana all have their beauty queens
elected with the blessings of the State.
Three newspapers and a television
company run the Miss Luxembourg
competition, and in Peru Pan-American
TV is the promoter. The latter devotes
80 hours of television to the contest
and sells the advertising time at $720
a minute.
“I suppose you wish to know how
we, a Socialist country, can justify
taking part in the Miss World compe-
tition?” David Husic, a journalist on
“Politika,” the Yugoslav newspaper,
grinned. He had no direct answer, but
chuckled and said, “There were grum-
blings at first, but after we released a

against the contest.”
For the girls themselves the Miss
World competition can be very profit-
able. Even if they do not win they
have already won their national com-
petition and return home to offers of

NEW ZEALAND
TV FUTURE UNCLEAR
PROSPECTS FOR politically inde-
pendent television have changed in New
Zealand with the advent of a Bill
setting up an authority to license fur-
ther radio and television stations. What
these prospects are, however, is not
clear.
The Government has created the
authority to do what the NZBC has
failed to do, license further corporation
or private channels, but although
private radio run by newspaper interests
may commence speedily, further tele-
vision channels are likely to be color
and NZBC-run.
The Opposition Labor Party say they
would repeal independent licences
granted under the new Act and would
create two competing corporations to be
as independent as the BBC. They would
allow commercial and minority groups
to contract for time. Labor spokesman
Dr. Martin Finlay’s comment in favor
of BBC-style independence counteracts
suspicion that Labor would shackle
no-holds-barred political debate and
touches on the central issue that sur-
faced in public debate last week.
Scorn was heaped on the NZBC
heads for an act of political timidity
that updates “the Compass file.” Com-
pass was the first current-affairs TV
program when it started in 1965 and
has since developed a reputation similar
to Australia’s “Four Corners.” As the
Compass team left last week to look at
Australian trade and culture, the Cor-
poration heads decided to postpone a
program on the Broadcasting Bill until
it had been passed by Parliament. A
public outcry forced a wishy-washy
substitute reprogramming within hours.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
ANALYSIS OF SUMMER
AN INQUIRY INTO why the long,
hot summer of 1968 was a reassuringly
peaceful one; at least as far as the
dreaded Negro riots were concerned,
reveals .that, while the summer may
have been somewhat reassuring, it was
not at all peaceful. The Department
of Justice makes a favorable com-
parison between last summer and that
of 1967, but the Lemberg Centre for
the Study of Violence at Brandeis
University, which digs more deeply,
finds that in the first eight months of
this year there were more than twice
as many incidents of violence as in
the whole of 1967. The eight months,
of course, include all the April dis-
turbances after Dr. Martin Luther
King’s death; these made that month
alone nearly as bad (and in a few
respects worse) than the whole of
1967.
These were riots which a large part
of the general public felt were
excusable, and they were dealt with
quickly, efficiently, and comparatively
leniently by the police and the National
Guard (America’s territorial army).
Speedy action of this kind kept later
disturbances from growing into head-
line stories; the National Guard has
been on permanent duty in one city,
Wilmington, Delaware, ever since.
Negro violence has been spread thinly
over the country this summer; nothing
in 1968 compared with Newark or
Detroit in 1967. Chicago might have
done, for originally, it is said, Negro
organisations planned to converge on
the Democratic convention at the end
of August. But Mayor Daley’s prepara-
tions convinced them that it would be
wiser to stay away. So the Chicago
police were left to demonstrate on
young people in front of the television
cameras what is done every day in
the ghetto, according to the local
Negroes, without attracting any
attention.
The April violence exhaused the
Negroes emotionally, an exhaustion
which, after a sustained riot, seems to
’ast for years — or so the experts at
the Lemberg Centre think. For this
reason they did not expect any major
troubles this summer, except maybe in
St. Louis, the only large city in
America which has not had a serious
outbreak in recent years. Many Negroes
have learnt that they damage them-
selves more than they do anyone else
when they burn and loot in their own
ghettos. And the horrors of these
ghettos have at last been forced on
the notice of the whole country by the
outbreaks of earlier years.
Just as the infant trade union move-
ment began in the last century with
violent demonstrations and then
learned to concentrate on striking for
clearly defined changes, so the Negro
National Guardsman out in Pittsburgh in one of the last of last summer’s riots
leaders are now concentrating on
specific objects —- improved schools
managed by Negroes, better jobs,
ownership of their own businesses. It
may sometimes take violence to get
what they want, but it will not — or
at least the more responsible leaders
hope that it will not — be uncontrolled
violence and it will occur when the
situation, and not the weather, dictates.
The militant Negro groups, of which
the Black Panthers are at present the
most publicised, contend that nothing
effective can be achieved without
active revolution. There have been
cases of ambushes and sniping at
policemen and others and there is talk
of terrorist activity like that of the
Stern gang in Palestine at the time
of the British mandate. But those who
know the Negroes best claim that the
leaders of these groups have neither
the conviction nor the competence
needed to succeed in guerilla warfare
— or sufficient sympathy within the
Negro communities.
LAST YEAR OF LIFE
DEATH “telegraphs its punch” about a
year in advance to aged persons, accord-
ing to a study carried out at the Uni-
versity of Chicago.
In some mysterious way, the subjects
of the experiment, who were between
70 and 95 years old, monitored internal
signs that they were going to die shortly
and confided them to the interviewer.
The changes were psychological, not
physical, and included the intellectual
and emotional areas.
Morton Lieberman, an Associate Pro-
fessor of Psychiatry, tested 80 persons in
the age bracket. Forty have died since
he began his study. Of these, 34 showed
a distinct awareness of the signs of
approaching death more than a year
before it occurred.
He emphasised that they were not
obviously physically ill when they felt
the signs.
“The psychology of death may begin
in middle age,” said Mr. Lieberman.
“People may begin coping with the
problem in their late fifties. By the time
they are truly old, most have come to
terms with the situation.”
He said that 24 percent of 1000
persons placed in an old-age institution
died within six months of admission,
compared with a death rate of 10 per-
cent of those who stayed at home.
Elizabeth Mann Borgese, writing in
the magazine of the Centre for the
Study of Democratic Institutions, at
Santa Barbara, California, predicted
that within 50 years man would no
longer die of natural causes. Cancer will
be controlled, and vital organs can be
replaced.
But she added, “The disintegration
of death means the disintegration of the
individual. His contours become blurred
in time and in space, giving rise to a
new form of continuity . . . the develop-
ment amounts to a mutation in the
species homo, for a human being that
must not or may not die is different
in quality from one that does ... it is
already clear that man must begin to
learn how to deal with the completely
novel implications of the disintegration
of death.”
VERY SOUR GRAPES
WHAT BEGAN three years ago as a
local strike against California grape
growers has becoijie a massive social
movement drawing together the Ameri-
can left, civil-rights organisations, old-
line trade unionists, and the big in-
dustrial unions.
The strike — for union recognition
— has since evolved into a national
boycott of table grapes. It involved
the sympathetic support of Robert F.
Kennedy before his death, and it was

a major political issue discussed by all
the Presidential candidates.
A Senate subcommittee has called the
plight of U.S. farmworkers generally
“a national disgrace.” They work an
average of ten or 12 hours a day, six
days a week, for an average annual in-
come of less than $2300. The squalid,
unsanitary living conditions of most
farm workers have drawn repeated
attention in the Press.
But, unlike industrial workers,
Federal law exempts farm employers
from bargaining collectively with their
employees, even though a majority of
the.m wish it.
Mexican-Americans dominate the
workforce in California’s $4000-million-
a-year vineyards. Their messiah is
Cesar Chavez, 41, who dramatised the
cause with a 25-day fast -— he broke
it when Kennedy came to visit him last
March.
“La Huelga” (the strike) became
“La Causa” (the cause), and outside
help began arriving in California’s
central valley.
So far, the 300,000 grape pickers
have succeeded in winning a paltry 11
contracts from more than 100 major
growers. But the few thousand lucky
workers have had their pay increased
to about $2.50 an hour.
Breaking the strike are thousands of
Mexican nationals who are permitted
to cross the border w'ith a green card
constituting a working visa for the U.S.
Said a union organiser: “The growers
are using the poorest of the poor of
another country to defeat the poorest
of the poor in this country.”
The boycott of California grapes has
become probably the most extensive
boycott in U.S. labor history. Organ-
isers have spread to Canada and as
far as Western Europe. In New York,
sales of grapes dropped by 90 percent
last summer.
But, in the recent election campaign.
Richard Nixon was alone among the
candidates in opposing the boycott and
strike. At a California campaign rally,
he gleefully popped grapes into his
mouth.
“We don’t have a prayer now he’s
been elected,” said an organiser. But
Chavez promises: “We will continue the
struggle.”
WHAT THE ELECTION COST
RUNNING FOR OFFICE is an expen-
sive luxury in America and it becomes
dearer with every campaign. No one
will ever know exactly how much was
spent this year (the committees
operating in more than one State have
until the end of the year to file their
final reports, and, under America’s lax
laws, this is only the tip of the iceberg).
But the Citizens’ Research Foundation,
whose estimates are widely accepted,
expects the total cost of all of this year’s
elections to reach $250 million, up from
$200 million in 1964 and $175 million
in 1960. One reason is common or
garden inflation; everything, from
balloons to staff salaries, keeps going
up. The most important reason, how-
ever, is the greater use of television and
its higher cost, partly because of the
introduction of color. Citizens’ Research
thinks that $5O million has probably
been spent this year on the buying of
television and radio time, compared
with $36 million four years ago.
By contrast with 1964, when the
Democratic nomination was President
Johnson’s by right, this year there were
bard fights for the presidential nomina-
tions on both sides. Mr. Nixon and
Mr. Rockefeller are thought to have
spent $5 million apiece. Mr. Humphrey,
although he entered none of the
primaries (the intra-party elections),
spent $3 million-$4 million before he
won the nomination, while Robert
Kennedy and Senator McCarthy, who
fought it out in the primaries, spent
more: from $6 million-$7 million for
Mr. McCarthy and from $4 million-$5
million for Robert Kennedy, who began
later. However,-one of the many gaps
in the law governing campaign financing
is that such preliminary spending is not
controlled; neither is that of com-
mittees operating in only one State.
After the drought of 1964, the Repub-
licans have returned to the tradition of
being the big spenders. They reported
expenditure of $l7 million, but not until
the day before the election—nine days
late—a surprising lapse on the part of
the notably efficient Nixon organisation.
It looked downright suspicious to Mr.
Lawrence O’Brien, the Democratic
campaign manager, who was quick to
claim that the delay was a deliberate
move to conceal from the voters the
names of Mr. Nixon’s big benefactors.
Republicans do not deny that a sub-
stantial part of their $2O million war
chest came in contributions of $lOOO
or more.
But Mr. O’Brien is not in a strong
position to criticise. His candidate was
able to put on a television spurt at the
end because of last-minute gifts or loans
from wealthy men; earlier, 18 rich
individuals provided $lOO,OOO or more
apiece. Under 30 big contributors are
said to have put up from a third to a
half of the $l2 million or so which
Mr. Humphrey probably spent. That
about $4 million of this is in repayable
loans is a mournful reflection of the
handicap which dogged Mr. Humphrey
throughout—the belief that he could not
win. He also suffered from the efforts
of the McCarthy and Kennedy sup-
porters to raise money to pay off their
deficits. Mr. Humphrey’s is likely to be
$5 million.
The man who really depended for
the bulk of his money on small contri-
butions is the frugal Mr. Wallace, who
has reported receiving $6.2 million and
spending $5.8 million up to October 21.
According to this report, three-quarters
of the money came in contributions of
under $lOO. Fewer than 20 people were
listed as giving $5OOO or more. Among
these was Judge Perez, of Louisiana,
the arch-segregationist.


CHANGING BRITAIN—1
A United States of England?
IS THE United Kingdom about to turn
itself into a “Federal Kingdom” and
sanction decolonisation, not only of its
far-flung Empire but also its own back
garden? That seems to be one of the
more revolutionary promises at first
inherent in the Wilson Government’s
plans, announced in the Speech from
the Throne at the opening of the pre-
sent Parliament, to set up a commission
to loosen Britain’s centralised govern-
ment.
The Commission’s announced job
“to consider what changes may be
needed in the central institutions of
Government in relation to the several
countries, nations, and regions of the
United Kingdom,” including the Isle
of Man and the Channel Islands, is
not merely revolutionary because it
seems to open the way for the first
time in British history for a devolution
■of power away from London. It also
opens the way to a written consti-
tution - which Britain has proudly
never possessed.
First reactions in the Press and among
politicians tended to write down the
Flashback to
the Prince
of Wales’
confron-
tation in
June
with Welsh
nationalists
who told
him he
should learn
Welsh
significance of the devolution proposals.
It was noted that the Government is
nodding to the increasing support that
Scottish and Welsh nationalists, in par-
ticular, are getting at parliamentary
elections. But it was also observed that
governments often set up commissions
in order to delay consideration of pro-
posed reforms. And this commission,
if it i uns according to form, will take
three years, at least, before it reports
back to the Government, and even
then it may not be unanimous in its
proposals, nor will the Government
have to act on them. Pressure of busi-
ness could mean that the commission
is not even set up during this session.
But, however true these deflationary
comments may be, public feeling in
various parts of Britain is now so
strong that some of the power which
London wields must eventually be
handed down to lesser authorities in
Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, St. Helier
(Channel Islands), and Douglas (Isle
of Man).
The big question is how real will be
the power that these regional centres
are bequeathed. And here there could
be radical changes of circumstances in
the period before the constitutional
commission reports back changes not
only in the public demand for more
local power, but particularly in the
British economy, which is really the
villain of this whole nationalist and
regional controversy in Britain.
The United Kingdom consists of
England and Wales one entity
Scotland, Northern. Ireland, the Isle
of Man, and the Channel Islands. The
last three all have some form of local
autonomy through their own elected
Parliaments and, by convention, Parlia-
ment at Westminster does not interfere
in the affairs of these regional
assemblies. The Isle of Man and the
Channel Islands also have the power
to fix their own taxes, which are con-
siderably lower than citizens in the rest
of the Kingdom pay.
Scotland has no elected assembly, but
it has its own distinctive systems of
justice and education, which are, in
some ways, superior to those of Eng-
land. Wales, the most integrated with
its English neighbor, has none of these
privileges, even though it is the only
nation in the Kingdom with a separate
and living language of its own. How-
ever, one immediate concession is to
be made to Welsh national feeling by
the transfer of responsibility for Welsh
agriculture and health to the Welsh
Office, thus bringing it on a par with
the Scottish Office.
This is a bare outline of the present
state of devolution in Great Britain,
but it hides a host of different prob-
lems and demands, some of them econ-
omic, some cultural, some linguistic,
and some a bit of each.
On one level there is the feeling of
cultural separateness that the non-
English peoples have always, to some
degree, nursed within their bosoms.
Very often it has been humorous and
quaint, as when a Scot looks down
upon the Sassenachs (Saxons), or a
Manxman boasts of his Parliament
being older than that at Westminster; it
manifests itself in kilts, whether orange
(in Northern Ireland) or tartan (in
Scotland), and the full-bodied singing
of massed choirs at Welsh eisteddfods;
in ancient pleas for justice voiced in
Norse in the Isle of Man and in
Norman French in the Channel
Islands. Though this separateness from
things English may be a commercialised
joke to the tourist, to the Scots and
Welsh, and others, it is a talisman of
national identity; occasionally, as' at a
football international, it can turn into
an intimidating echo from history-with
the cry of “Bannockburn” or “Glen-
dower.”
On another level, the non-English
peoples have a co,mplaint against the
bureaucracy of London, a complaint
which has swelled greater and greater
in line with the growth of the cen-
tralised government, particularly in the
past 20 years. This grievance, which
the non-English share with many of the
English themselves, who live away from
the densely populated south-east, is
often a vague complaint against the
“faceless ones” in London, the civil
servants, the BBC-accented, standard
English-speaking men, whom the York-
shiremen, as well as the Scots, identify
as “Them.”
Undoubtedly the most potent griev-
ance that the nations and regions have
against London is economic. Since the
war, a large section of Britain’s in-
dustry has been removed from local
control and comes under the direct say-
so of London. This has happened in
the public sector with the nationalis-
ation of coal and steel, the railways,
and other transport undertakings, but it
is also increasingly happening in the
private sector, where mergers have pro-
duced larger and larger combines in
the interests of export competitiveness.
But when a coal mine or a railway
line is closed as uneconomic, or a lab-
oratory or factory is declared super-
fluous to requirements by the board of
a newly merged group of companies,
it often means unemployment and hard-
ship in the remoter areas of the British
Isles.
The people of these areas have com-
plained with some justice over the past
two years of economic difficulty that
they have had to bear an unfair share
of the unemployment and retrench-
ment. And, although the Government
and its predecessor have tried to en-
courage special investment in these
regions, by declaring many of them
“Development Areas,” it is inevitable
that this work of rescue and reclama-
tion has been unable to keep pace with
the economies that have been steaming


.ahead recently under the banners of
■“modernisation” and “rationalisation.”
The people who suffer from these
economies would rather that they did
not take place at all, of course. But
they can now complain, with justifi-
cation, that they have often been in-
adequately consulted or even not
•consulted at all before their liveli-
hood and the economic basis of their
local community has been assigned to
the scrapheap by an executive order
from London.
Thus, an economic motive has been
added to the demand for a greater say
in local affairs by people who already
have a nationalist, linguistic, cultural,
or just local pride. Even the tiny
Isle of Man has an economic grievance
behind its desire to run its own com-
mercial radio station on a frequency
that can reach all parts of the United
Kingdom; it needs such a radio to
advertise its tourist attractiveness.
Are these demands likely to be sanc-
tioned by the commission which is to
be set up, or, more importantly, acted
upon by the Government? To the
extent of giving the separate nations
and regions of the United Kingdom a
decisive say in their own affairs, the
answer is probably “no.” Without a
doubt, the Government will be pre-
pared to allow the regional centres a
greater degree of consultation, even
regional Parliaments; but the power of
these assemblies to oppose or defeat
national policies in the local interest
does not seem likely. The existing
system of English and Welsh local
government, which is at present under
review, already produces friction
enough between London and local
authorities in crucial areas such as
housing, planning, and education. Any
scheme for a genuine federal system
of govern,ment in Britain would seem
out of the question.
Here again, the crucial factor is the
economy. Both of Britain’s major poli-
tical parties are committed to strength-
ening and modernising the nation’s
industry and at this crucial time can-
not afford to halt or delay the process
in the interests of decentralisation. This
applies especially to the Labor Party,
Viow in which has always be-
lieved in a strong central government
as a means of bringing social justice to
all parts of the country.
It is ironical that in the midst of
the outcry for more local power, a
demand for firmer central control
should have been raised recently in
respect of Northern Ireland. The six
counties of Ulster have a large degree
of autonomy through their own Parlia-
,ment at the Stormont, outside Belfast.
But this year a campaign has been
raised against the allegedly undemo-
cratic nature of Ulster’s home rule,
which, it is said, discriminates against
the Roman Catholic minority in the
fields of housing, education, employ-
ment, and elections to the Stormont.
This campaign against injustice in
Ulster, led by members of the Labor
Party, illustrates the danger that many
in the Party have always seen in un-
controlled regionalism. The commission
on regionalism will report back at some
time in the future, and the Government
will, no doubt, act upon some of its
recommendations. But, for economic
and political reasons, the Labor Govern-
ment is unlikely to give in to the basic
demands of the Scottish and Welsh
nationalists and other local radicals.
And, by the time that the commission
reports back, perhaps the longed-for
improvements in Britain’s economic
position will have taken some of the
steam out of the nationalists’ demands.
CHANGING BRITAIN —II
Gagging the hereditary peers
The annual ritual in the Lards, where the
present hereditary basis is to be revoked
SO FAR AS they go, the povernment’s
proposals for early reform of the House
of Lords are full of good intentions.
The hereditary principle is to be extin-
guished by depriving the present hered-
itary peers of the vote, and their heirs
of the privilege of attendance. Under
a two-tier system only a working core
of around 230 peers, who will be
specially nominated, will be allowed to
vote. The government of the day will
be assured of a ten percent majority
over the combined opposition peers,
but not over the House as a whole,
because some 30 crossbench peers will
be given the vote to see that they don’t.
As a compromise between abolishing
the hereditary principle in one blow
and retaining it indefinitely, it is about
as good as could be expected.
As the reformed House of Lords will
have the power to delay legislation
(except money bills) for six months
from the day of their disagreement with
the Commons, the Government has
shown some courage in not ensuring for
itself a built-in majority. And so, of
course, have the Tory leaders in sur-
rendering their own built-in majority
among the hereditary peers. This
majority can be an embarrassment
occasionally to the moderate Tory
leaders when they are in opposition
and a Labor Government is unpopular,
for their sillier members think it could
be used to precipitate a general
election; it is useful when they’re in
government.
The view common to both the Labor
and Tory leaders in the Lords is that
the reformed composition of their
chamber will give it greater indepen-
dence. The argument is that many peers
have in the past been reluctant to vote
against Labor Governments because
they were sensible of the essential
unfairness of the hereditary Tory
majority, and when their voting rights
have a more respectable basis they will
be that much more prepared to oppose
the Commons.
This might well be so. Indeed it
would not be very difficult to improve
on the Lords’ record. Since 1914 only
one Bill has been passed over the con-
tinued opposition of the Lords (the
Parliament Bill of 1947), and on the
one occasion when they rejected a
statutory instrument (the Rhodesian
sanctions order last June) they caved
in when it was presented again. But for
all their present good intentions, neither
a Labor nor Tory government would
take very kindly to having its legislative
program disrupted by the Lords.
The Lords know that. It is therefore
extremely unlikely that they would
press their opposition to the will of
the Commons very much more in the
future than they have in the past. They
would still be sensible of their
essentially unrepresentative character.
But one of the attractions of the com-
positional reforms to many moderate
peers is that the future unpredictability
of the vote in the Lords would bring
added status and attention to their
debates. It might for a while. But when
the old predictability became once more
apparent, as it would, it is possible
that the news media’s disappointment
might result in even less attention being
paid to Lords’ debates than now.
Probably most Tories would not mind
that. Few of them seem to expect, or
even desire, any great change in the
functions of the Lords to result from
the reforms. Of course the old die-
hards, such as Mr. Enoch Powell,
oppose the extinction of the hereditary
principle for their own romantic
reasons. But the leaders of the Tory
peers welcome it for two reasons: it
will get a cantankerous nuisance off
their hands, and will probably end the
danger that a future Labor govern-
ment might abolish the place altogether.

AUSTRALIA AND NIXON
-WHAT NOW?
Richard Nixon...
"It seems likely
that in Vietnam
President Nixon
will carry on from
where President
Johnson left off:
it seems even more
likely that he will
carry over the
State Department's
approach to
Australia that it
should grow up a
bit and do more off
its own bat in
South-East Asia."
By DONALD HORNE
AMERICANS ARE FED UP with
themselves. This fact will be as im-
portant to the relations of Australia
with President Nixon’s America as
anything Candidate Nixon said on
foreign policy during his campaign.
The measure of Americans’ doubts
about themselves came out in the mid-
summer public opinion polls. More
than 50 percent of those interviewed
didn’t believe in the Supreme Court;
53 percent thought of America as a
country where the “rich get richer and
the poor get poorer”; 55 percent
thought “there was something deeply
wrong with American society”; nearly
60 percent didn’t believe in Congress;
70 percent didn’t believe in the manner
of conducting the Vietnam War; 'Bl
percent didn’t believe in the Federal
Government; 87 percent didn’t believe
in politics. If they had had their ow’n
pick for candidate only 20 percent
would have chosen Mr. Nixon and only
eight percent would have chosen Mr.
Humphrey.
The polls showed that disillusion was
not just the product of youth, intel-
lectualism, or blackness. It came from
“a long and diverse number of dis-
affected,” many of whom were fed up
with “unfilled promises and mil-
lcnarian rhetoric.”
President Nixon will have to take this
American self-dissatisfaction into
account in his foreign policy, as in
everything else, for two connected
reasons. One is that he wants to be
re-elected President in 1972. The
second is that if he is to do this he
might have to switch sides. Both of
these demands are important in assess-
ing the possible relations between
Nixon’s America and Gorton’s
Australia.
There is not much to say about the
first consideration except that, as soon
as they take office, all American Presi-
dents have had their seeond term in
mind—and that, if the American mood
goes on as miserably as it has this
year, to achieve a second term may
beco.mc more difficult than it used
to be.
So far as switching sides is con-
cerned a President Nixon looking for
a second term has little option. Like
John F. Kennedy, he wfill become Presi-
dent by a fluke in voting patterns: he
has no clear majority and the election
could easily have gone the other way.
Like President Kennedy, he will have
to develop a more general appeal, but
this is going to be more difficult for
him to do by mere rhetoric than it was
for Kennedy. For one thing, Mr. Nixon
is no good as a rhetorician, but more
important is the fact that America
itself is now more difficult for its Presi-
dent to get on with than it was in 1960.
But for Mr. Nixon there is the
special problem that the areas of diffi-
culty—of racial tension, crime, poverty,
and of theories about the “character
and dignity of life”—arc the special
concerns of those parts of America in
which his voting strength was weakest.
They are essentially the problems of
the big cities and, with the exception
of Los Angeles and a few places in
Texas, Mr. Nixon did not win any big
cities. He got in on the southern
border States, the underpopulated
States, the conservative suburbs, and the
West Coast. To do better in 1972 he
must capture the support of the cities
-—or fail.
This means two things. In the first
place he must stand firmly in the politi-
cal centre (thereby deserting those who
have put him in but who have nowhere
except George Wallace to go). By this
means, in a Congress that is theoretic-
ally hostile, in the sense that the
Democrats have a majority, he might
nevertheless gain majority support. The
Republicans want to win more seats in
the 1970 Congress elections and even
some of the conservative Republicans
might line up with the liberal Republi-
cans to this end; if they do so they
might, with the liberal Democrats, pro-
duce what is in effect a liberal Con-
gress, so there could be the paradox
that Republican President Nixon might
be able to achieve more liberal
measures, with a liberal Congress, than
Democratic President Johnson was able
to achieve with the conservative Con-
gress that frustrated him in his unlucky
second term. However, the important
second factor is that however liberal
the measures and however liberal the
Congress, they must jail in the sense
that the tensions of America’s cities are
not going to he blown-away in four
years. President Nixon might score
points by being a trier but even
President Johnson, the great urban and
social refor'mer, didn’t score enough
points to sustain his support.
That there is a political necessity
for Mr. Nixon to step a bit to the Left
shows how naive were the reactions
in Canberra and elsewhere in Aus-
tralia to the image of Hubert the
Dove and Richard the Hawk, with
H umphrey standing for ‘‘sell out” in
Vietnam and Nixon for a “firm line.”
It is even possible that political
expediency might have demanded that
a President Humphrey might have felt
it necessary to stand, or appear to
stand, a bit higher up the escalator
than a President Nixon.
The second consideration that even
with a liberal Congress President
Nixon will not be able to “solve” the
problems of the cities within four years,
however much he seeks their support —-
also reveals the tinniness of that kind
of Canberra-thinking that secs little
other possibility than that, because they
have domestic tensions, the Americans
will now turn their backs on the world.
This thinking is all the more surprising
in that it is now a general belief that
the unsatisfactory state of affairs of
things at ho m e can sometimes
strengthen a nation’s interest in its
role in the world. Because America’s
self-defined tensions arc temporarily in-
soluble, there can be political advan-
tage gained abroad. In his own country
an American President is going to find
it hard to take any tricks: to show
what kind of a man he is, his main
hope (which may not be fulfilled) may
be to try to cut some kind of a figure
in the rest of the world. (There is, of
course, the question of where he does
the cutting, or what he cuts out.)
The most realistic way to guess about
the policies of the next President may
be to assume that, to begin with, any-
way, a Humphrey administration might
have been much the same as a Nixon

administration. There are many in-
tractabilities of power that make this
likely the sheer momentum of past
policy, the general thrust of the
bureaucracies, the pressure of outside
events, the bookkeeping of economic
problems, the concern for political
advantage at home. President Thieu
seemed to think that Mr. Nixon would
be more his way than Mr. Humphrey
and, like President Johnson, he tried
to affect the result by last-minute
manoeuvres just before the poll but
only five days passed before Mr. Nixon
was giving support to President John-
son’s policies.
The general drift of American policy
on Vietnam has been to “de-Ameriean-
ise” the struggle and to give up the
idea that a quick military victory could
be gained by overwhelming American
strength in South Vietnam and strategic
bombing in the North. The Westmore-
land policy of “search and destroy” is
in ruins, because it did not work. The
Americans could search in Vietnam, but
they couldn’t destroy, because they
couldn’t find the main forces they were
looking for. Strategic bombing may
have achieved one of its purposes in
providing a bargaining point there
is no open bargain with North Vietnam,
but there seems to be a concealed one
but, predictably, it did not achieve
the effect of demoralisation, no more
than it did in World War 11. Simi-
larly the idea has also been abandoned
that the Americans could take over and
somehow “win” even if by doing so
they shouldered aside the South Viet-
namese, whose victory it was supposed
to be.
There will now be a concentration
on the security of those areas that are
favorable to the Saigon Government,
or more unfavorable to the NLF than
they are to the Saigon Government, and
a diminution of American prominence.
This puts the Americans in a holding
position in which the political heat can
cool off back home and in which, now-
moving from strength rather than the
weakness of the “search and destroy”
position, they can bargain in Paris with
the idea that some kind of political
settlement might emerge (but not one
including an enforced coalition gov-
ernment with the NLF), so that, if it
did, the struggle could be continued by
other means.
In both the Government Parties and
the Labor Party, there has been a
great deal of over-reaction in Canberra
to this switch in the American line.
It may be good politics for the Labor
Party to claim that the Americans have
now adopted ALP policy, but it is
not true. It depends, of course, which
ALP you are talking about. Those
members of the ALP who privately
supported the war in balance but
criticised its method have had a victory.
But to those other Labor men who
actually opposed the war it should be
pointed out that the original prompt-
ing of American policy was not to
destroy North Vietnam but to prevent
it winning: it was not the, preservation
of the status quo in Saigon but an
attempt to give South-East Asia a
breathing space. The Americans will
have made a decisive change in policy
only if they give or sell Saigon to
Hanoi.
(One should recognise, of course,
that such a change is possible. It would
come, however, not from rational policy
changes but from the accidents of that
bitterness between Washington and
Saigon which now seems to some
extent inevitable. This would, literally,
lie de-Americanisation with a ven-
geance. )
The over-reaction in the Government
Parties has come from a misunder-
standing of Australia’s alliance with
America. Falsely if not always con-
sciously this has been seen as some-
thing similar to Australia’s old role as
a loyal son of Empire. Where the
Empire went, Australia went not
only for reasons of sentiment, although
these were very strong, but also for
reasons of self-interest: both flattery
and expeditionary forces were the price
we paid. But even with the British, at
least privately, wartime Australian
Prime Ministers would kick up a fuss
if they thought Australian interests were
involved, or if there were differences
in approach. This did not happen in
the case of South Vietnam, yet there
was at least one issue on which it
might well have done so and if it
had, the Australian Government would
have been proved spectacularly right.
This issue was central: it was the
question of how the war should be
fought. A carefully articulated position
had been worked out within the Aus-
tralian Army that the policy of “search
and destroy” wouldn’t work: an alterna-
tive policy was envisaged of providing
security and welfare for pro-
Government and anti-NLF areas, while
encouraging greater initiative among
the South Vietnamese themselves. In
other words, the new American policy.
A great Australian leader could have
seized on this policy and insisted that
the Americans could do what they liked,
but this would be how the Australians
intended to conduct themselves in
“their" province; he would have put in
more civil-aid teams and made the
“Australian province” a showpiece.
Consider what speeches our leaders
could now' be making if this had
happened! Instead the Australian Task
Force was more or less put at the
disposal of the American Army.
The Australian Government did not
seize on this opportunity because,
among other things, it had only a
partial interest in Vietnam, and its
interest in the rest of South-East Asia
was over-simple. Its prime interest was
to make a good showing with the
Americans. But the best way of doing
that was not necessarily to be an echo
chamber; as it happened, the echoes of
our “loyalty” to America went on
sounding when the Americans were
changing their tune. Because it con-
fused overall support for general objec-
tives with particular support for
particular tactics the Australian Gov-
ernment is now flummoxed by the
American changes, and at least some

members of it seem to think that
because the Americans have changed
their particular approaches they must
necessarily have abandoned their
general objectives. Yet, as someone in
Washington said to the “Age’s” special
writer, Bruce Grant,last week: “You
don’t reverse policies unless you are
defeated. You build on what you have.”
: It is not surprising that someone else
told Mr. Grant that Canberra seemed
“intellectually disorganised.”
It seems likely that in Vietnam
President Nixon will carry on from
where President Johnson left off; it
seems even more likely that he will
carry over the State Department’s
approach to Australia that it should
grow up a bit and do more off its
own bat in South-East Asia. This point
has been made so often in The Bulletin
that it might seem unnecessary to
repeat it; but the Prime Minister simply
did not believe it when he took office
and there is no evidence that he believes
it even now. With varying degrees of
politeness or bluntness the American
attitude is that something more positive
is to be expected of Australia than the
role of a loyal hanger-on and urger;
that, geo-politically, Australia is part of
South-East Asia and America is not,
sD that if Australia wants America to
continue an interest in this region it
might begin by showing more of an
Interest itself. In its bluntest form the
American attitude can be that if the
Australians think they can simply rely
on the Anzus Pact without doing any-
thing for the security of South-East
Asia, then they might have another
think coming. One of the paradoxes of
the position is that what is most likely
to impress the Americans is not
“loyalty” but independent initiative.
There is nothing new about Mr.
Nixon’s spelling-out of a policy of
greater self-reliance in the Asian and
Pacific region. It has been there all the
time. The difference is that Mr. Nixon
has said it out loud and that in the
new circumstances of internal American
disaffection the new President is likely
to be a bit harder to get on with. Presi-
dent Johnson’s illusion of infinite power
has collapsed. The novelty of Mr.
Nixon’s position, such as it is, lies in
his idea of the institutionalisation of
regional independence. In his wildest
dreams he would like to see ASPAC
become NATO. If he continues, even
if only for a while, with such a policy
it is likely to cause a great deal of
tension, particularly with Japan, and
Australia is going to get tossed around
a bit as a result of that tension if its
foreign policy is nothing more than
Mr. Gorton’s unconfident edging toward
isolationism.
In fact, one of the first and most
interesting by-products of Mr. Nixon’s
insistence on more initiatives in the
Asia and Pacific region could be that
Australia and Japan, recognising that
they are in the same boat, may be
pushed much more closely together very
quickly. It was a fluke that it was the
week after the American elections in
which the annual top-level diplomatic
exchange between Australia and Japan
took place in Tokyo, but the timing
could not have been better. Perhaps
Australia may now satisfy the Japanese
desire to raise the status of this annual
exchange to the Foreign Minister level.
We should certainly at once strengthen
our normal diplomatic representation
in Tokyo.
An American withdrawal of interest
in East Asia and the Pacific would at
present be unthinkable to Mr. Nixon.
In addition, it would seem likely that
some Americans are now creating out
of Australia some ideas that can cheer
them up when they think of their own
disaffections. That these ideas may not
yet be strong and that they may do
Australia both more and less justice
than it deserves does not destroy their
potential importance. Even if the next
American administration does attempt
to be more “Europe-oriented” than Mr.
Johnson’s, it is not going to get much
comfort from that suspicious, envious,
and sourly parochial environment. It
will still be looking around for some-
thing else. Although you wouldn’t
always think it if you live here, there
can be a sense of a future about Aus-
tralia if it is observed from a foreign
nation that is different from that sense
of betrayal by the past that affects so
much of the prosperous industrialised
world.
This feeling of aspiration toward
Australia can continue even if we do
not altogether earn it. But it might not
survive if by its conduct our Govern-
ment dramatically denied it. Just as
there is in embryo the false but Hatter-
ins; concept of Australia as a last
frontier of the aspirations of the West,
so there is also the false but damaging
concept of Australia as the South
Africa of South-East Asia. An Aus-
tralian Government whose conduct was
isolationist and whose isolationism
seemed, or could be made seem, to be
based on cowardice, stupidity, selfish-
ness, and bigotry could achieve the diffi-
cult trick of doing Australia in, so far
as the rest of the world was concerned.
At the same time Americans are far
from being all aspiration. When they
feel like it they can be hard bargainers.
The Australian Government would
scarcely seem to have begun to under-
stand that this is so. Where special
interest is involved, the Americans
not unnaturally want the best deal
they can get. And from their
manoeuvres in Saigon just before
election day it can be seen how far they
can go when their President raises the
scent of a strong domestic political
advantage.
From his recent speech attacking
American protectionism, at least the
Australian Treasurer seems to under-
stand where a Nixon administration
might become tougher than President
Johnson’s, and that quickly. Mr.
McMahon understands that although
President Nixon might be freer toward
American investment abroad he might
upset that liberalisation of American
trading policy that President Kennedy
began. During his campaign he was
playing for the support of the beef,
textile, and steel lobbies; if he takes,
harsh measures to protect these domes-
tic interests it will take off Australia’s
face the smile that might be put there
by increased American investment
directly, so far as beef is concerned,
because America is now our main
market, and, indirectly, so far as
textiles and steel are concerned,
because one of the reasons why the
Japanese buy wool and iron ore from
us is to process it and sell the result to
Americans.
To defeat an American lobby is
beyond the power of a single foreign
nation, and sometimes of the whole
world. But this week would be none
too soon for Australian representatives
in Tokyo to be already discussing with
the Japanese what world pressures can
be brought on Mr. Nixon to help him
change his mind about his protec-

tionist trading policies. Affronting a
lobby to which the President owes
something is an example of just about
how hard bargaining can be with the
Americans. An easier example would
be the F-l-11 purchase about which
Australia did no bargaining at all,
despite a reasonably strong position.
So far as bargaining on higher
strategy is concerned or even agree-
ing on it one essential requirement,
with Mr. Nixon, or with any other
President, is that discussion should be
carried on with a greater degree of
firmness, carefulness, expertness,
subtlety, and intelligence than Mr.
Gorton has so far shown himself
capable of in the field of foreign affairs.
Whatever his domestic performance,
Mr. Gorton has so far been, lamentably,
a novice in foreign policy. He has made
far too many off-the-cuff statements,
and the result of this carelessness, since
it has so far been unfortunately com-
bined with a complete lack of decision,
has been that at least five of our firmest
friends are becoming increasingly fed
up with this mixture of outward
agonising with inner blankness. They
are Britain, Singapore, Malaysia, New
Zealand, and the United States all
of them waiting to see what on earth
we intend to do in Singapore and
Malaysia after the British go. It can
be all right to say nothing until you
have made up your mind. But to say
a lot without making up your mind is
merely irritating.
Now, to add insult to irritation, it
was the Australian Prime Minister who
provided confirmation of the rumors
that President Johnson was negotiating
a compromise. When Mr. Gorton called
a midnight Press conference to say
that Australia had been consulted on
a bombing halt and that there was
only one outstanding matter to be
sorted out he seriously embarrassed the
American administration, and may in-
directly and accidentally have impeded
the sorting out of the outstanding mat-
ter which was the key question of
representation at the Paris talks.
Mr. Gorton’s attitude to diplomacy
is that of the one-man band. But he
plays without any instruments. He has
no aptitude for it, nor knowledge, yet
he wants to do it all by himself with-
out the assistance of the External
Affairs Department or anyone else. This
must inevitably mean that when, for
instance, he discusses policy with
President Nixon in the White House
he is likely to make a fool of himself
and of Australia unless, as he must
surely learn to do by then, he has
learned to use others to help him.
Otherwise there will be President
Nixon, speaking with the confidence of
one who can draw on brains other
than his own, and some of them among
the smartest in America, and there
will be Prime Minister Gorton making
it up as he goes along. It is our
Prime Minister’s duty to the nation
he serves to achieve at least a mini-
mum competence in this field as
quickly as he can.


Down on the
Health Farm
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
Some
professional
advice in the
sunbathing area
of Hopewood
Health Centre
TWO SIGNS. One points to the right
and says African Lion Safari. The other
to the left says Hopewood Health
Centre. In Wallacia, 37 miles from the
G.P.0., Sydney.
It is near enough to noon and about
ten people are sitting on sofas and chairs
around a log fire. They present a
subdued picture and are dressed in the
kind of anonymous way that people do
when told to wear comfortable things,
with the exception of a blonde, tanned
woman in white stretch trousers and
some sort of colored zigzag sweater.
“Well, I hope you’ve brought some
good weather with you,” she says, sway-
ing across a pair of zip-up carpet
slippers that are nervously withdrawn a
second too late. Everyone stops talking
and knitting and waits to see how this
will develop. “We don’t want to see
you losing that tan of yours, do we?”
And that’s it. She saunters out through
the door to inspect the sky. Grey as
fog. It turns out later that whenever
the sun is in or out, or just about to
be in or out, everyone says oh, Mrs.
H will love this, or Mrs. H
will hate it. Of all the people staying
at Hopewood, there are about 40, it
does appear that Mrs. H is the
one person who predominates.
It has taken some time to organise
this weekend at Hopewood. In the
first place, they weren’t too keen on
having me there. “Are you,” the presi-
dent, Mrs. Madge Cockburn, asked, “a
provocative sort of writer? We’ve had
journalists in the past who’ve made out
that we are cranks and poked fun at us.
One said we had a millionaire staying
here, which wasn’t true. In any case, we
are non-profit making. This sort of
thing does a lot of harm to us.” And,
secondly, they were pretty well booked
up.
Anyway, I am here. Two days
earlier, Peter Flanagan, the centre’s
consultant in Sydney, examined me by
a method called Iris Diagnosis, the
theory being that every mark and shad-
ing in the eye mirrors what the body is
up to. Mine was full of toxic poison. I
had a tendency to constipation, but my
constitution was good and my positive
thinking would make it possible to
overcome what in other people of my
condition would be much more serious.
My diet habits would have to change
and this would help the spinal condition
which I got falling down a flight of
stairs during a rather good party nine
months ago. It could take from three
months to three years for all this to be
put right, which was a bit depressing to
hear.
Mr. Flanagan had a mesmeric quality
about him, which defied interruption,
and after talking for half an hour about
the late Mr. Leslie Owen Bailey, who
founded Hopewood and the Natural
Health Society of N.S.W., and a very
worthy but dull fellow he made him
sound, he added the information that
his two children have been vegetarians
since birth and never had a day’s medi-
cation. The only thing his wife goes
to a supermarket for is lavatory paper
and cleaning materials, otherwise, their
life force is the greengrocer. Which,
apart fi'om anything else, he pointed
out cut down on the washing-up.
“.' . . ah, yes, I’ll show you round.” It
is Miss Holcombe, Hopewood’s house-
keeper, ready for the tour which all
guests (the word patient is never used)
and visitors are given. A hundred visi-
tors are expected tomorrow, Sunday, all
members of the National Health Society
for a Christmas get-together, which will
consist of a smorgasbord lunch at $1.50
a head, a chance to meet Mr. Jack
Dunn Trop, an American film producer
who lives the natural hygiene way and
has been imported to Australia with
Mrs. Trop to promote healthy living
here; and there is also to be entertain-
ment by singer Dave C. Nelson, des-
cribed by his partner Jackie Kenna as
Australia’s Sammy Davis Jr. Normally
the public come in on Sunday, officially
to enjoy the smorgasbord and look
around; unofficially, says a nurse,
they’re just curious. “This is the
lounge,” says Miss Holcombe. The
party by the fireplace is listening to
every syllable. It is one of those foyer-
like rooms,- decorated and furnished in
what is described as a comfortable
manner. There is a grand piano which
has Mrs. Cockburn’s photograph
standing on a lace mat, and
nearby on the wall is a large gold-
framed oil painting of Mr. Bailey. We
go through a door, down a carpeted
passage, and on to a veranda “. . .
this is the treatment annex with quali-
fied nurses in attendance and that,”
pointing to a large bottle of liquid, “is
filtered rainwater. You have your own
supply in your room, but please come
here for replacements. Here is where
we sunbathe,” passing a large grass
area and two shelters marked Ladies
and Gentlemen for those going the
whole hog, “and this is your room.”
Miss Holcombe has the same mesmeric
quality as Mr. Flanagan. She explains
I’ll be woken with fruit juice, exercises
are at 8.30, breakfast at 9, lunch at
one, dinner at six, treatments would be
tannoyed, Mr. Hall gives a daily inter-
view, the telephone works only when
the handle is turned, and there is some-
one next door who shares the bathroom.
The believers, and there are many
here, talk of their change to Natural
Health which is vegetarianism,
exercise, sun, none of the smoking,
alcohol, pill-taking that they may have
indulged in before with a fervor
tinged with pity for those who do not.
So,me come as a last resort, the words
are used constantly, when their medical
men say there’s no more they can do;
those with ulcers, skin diseases,
arthritis, and so on. Hopewood doesn’t
claim to cure. It does claim “if your
body’s healthy, you are healthy.” There
are fat people trying to get thin, thin
ones trying to fatten up. “Eat sensibly
and calories don’t come into it.” Eat
natural foods. Get rid of toxic poison.
Let nature work for you. Don’t drink,
smoke, eat meat. Do exercise. Hope-
wood is serious in a jolly sort of way.
Earnest believers with good, clean-living

cannot understand. I am to have a
Cleansing Diet, which is one pound of
non-protein salad and fruit three times
a day, lemon and grapefruit juice night
and morning; a Vapor Steam Bath, a
Spinal Manipulation, and a Hot and
Cold Sitz. Which is, sits in hot water
three minutes, sits in cold one minute,
repeat three times. Treatment all-
inclusive with roo,m and food, ten
dollars a day. But now, if he can be
excused, his wife is expecting him home
to babysit.
There is no one sexy or beautiful
around the place. There is one man
with a good body, which he covers with
Coney Island playtogs, and on his head
a Frank Sinatra straw hat. There is one
young girl who wears rollers in her
hair all day, another in her twenties who
says no, she doesn’t want to appear in
any photograph, definitely not. The
staff, toward early evening, are rushing
around with anxious looks. Mr. Hall
forgets to order my Vapor Bath and the
nurse, who is developing a heavy cold,
sighs and says it has been rather a day.
There is an element of danger in the
Vapor Bath and Spinal Manipulation
that is almost exciting. The Hot and
Cold Sitz is good for the pelvic area
and colon, but there is something
aesthetically displeasing massaging the
stomach in a crouched position. It is
so easy, says Mrs. B , who is here on
a rest from the Blue Mountains, to
cheat and stay in the hot side the whole
time. One 16-stone guest from Russia
got jammed in and it took three nurses
to get her out. The Vapor Bath is a
cylinder which allows only the head to
appear, in which one lies naked and
endures ten minutes of intense heat that
is very hard on the bottom. This is
followed by 20 minutes wrapped in wet,
icy sheets, during which the body warms
up and relaxes completely. Whereas
in Spinal Manipulation, as applied by
Mr. Hall’s assistant Mr. Horner, the
sensation is that of the body coming
apart and never meeting up in the right
places again. He points out that my
spine is crooked and that what he is
now doing is also done by Japanese
women with their bare feet on the backs
of men, but that he has little faith in it.
After dinner, which is a bowl of fruit
salad and enclosed in a plastic dome-
shaped cover “. . . anything to the front
and right is yours, anything to the left
is 7iot . . .” guests disperse to bed,
to the log fire, and to the television
room. The sensation of the evening is
the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Dunn
Trop, impeccably dressed in Harper’s
Bazaar travelling clothes and heard to
welcome everyone in tremendous Ameri-
can accents. Mrs. H , in a silky top
now with her white pants, is holding
court by the television and saying grip-
top nylons are bad for varicose veins
and, anyway, the fat spills over the
top. The one man here says does
everyone mind, he is leaving. At 8.30
pulverised prunes and fruit juice is
handed to those allowed, and by nine
most guests retire.
“. . . well, and about time, too.”
Mrs. H is in a bikini and lathering
on the sun oil followed by a layer of
insect repellent. It is- 8.15 on Sunday,
and she and three others are lying on
cane chairs and saying they’re not
doing exercises today . . . today,
thanks very much, they can’t possibly
go home without some tan. Two men
have stripped completely inside their
enclosure. One woman is lying in the
girls’, completely clothed except for
an area around her waist. Temperatures
were taken at 7.30, lemon juice at 8,
and Mr. Bailey, another of Mr. Hall’s
assistants, is urging everyone on to
greater effort in the exercise-room.
The response is not electric. The rush
to breakfast is.
Today is the big day of the Christ-
mas get-together, and all morning
tannoys are imploring guests to bear
with staff and the sudden inundation
of visitors, which is due to begin at
11.30. All the VIPs are coming from
Sydney, including Mrs. Cockburn her-
self, Mrs. Haddon the Liaison Officer,
Peter Flanagan with his family, and
so on. Mr. and Mrs. Jack Dunn Trop
are even more sensational this morning.
They walk out in virgin-white tennis
gear and go on to the courts for a
game or two. “If anyone here won’t
co-operate for pictures,” says Mr. Dunn
Trop, “you just let me know. I know
the problems.” Mr. Trop’s book “You
DON'T Have To Be Sick!” is on sale
here in the office at $1 a copy, and
today he is autographing those sold.
He has a sock-it-to-me humorous
approach to healthy living and says
the only strict rule he makes is never
to discuss food at the table. People
should just get on with the business
of eating it, so long as it’s a good,
fresh salad or bowl of fruit, taken
preferably once a day. The dining-
room is set with a long table down
the centre and on it are the results
of gardener Mr. Clarke’s labor in the
two acres of richly organic earth, and
everywhere people are running around
with tables and chairs.
And out in the sunbathing area . . .
“. . . what I miss is coffee . .
. . but tea’s worse for you . .
“• . . the food here’s put me off food
for ever . .
“. . . what about the man who came
all the way from New Guinea to lose
weight and kept sneaking to the cafe
for cheese sandwiches. How’d they
know? The cafe sneaked on him . .
. . one woman was told to take
her clothes off and sunbathe and they
found her by the front entrance with-
out a stitch on . .
The hundred Natural Health Society
of N.S.W. members are enjoying their
lunch when the entertainment arrives.
They are glowing, good-looking, and
dressed in hip gear, and, what is more,
they are both food reformists. Dave
reckons it saved his life, so today he is
contributing his services free; he is also
paying for the pianist, who is late. In
fact lost. Jackie says vegetarianism is
great, but she doesn’t force her ideas
on friends, f’instance, they’re going on
to Barry Crocker’s barbecue and she
wouldn’t dream of asking him to make
a salad for her. Anyway, Dave leaves
to do some deep-breathing exercises
before appearing on stage, and Jackie
says we simply must meet Lizalotta
Valesca, formerly Miss Finland 1930.
And so, through the cries of children
and pitter-patter of rushing mothers’'
feet, Mrs. Cockburn, Mr. Dunn Trop,
Dave and Jackie deliver themselves of
speeches and entertainment. Miss Fin-
land 1930 also tells a story or two and
is just starting on her fourth when
Mrs. Haddon, the Liaison Officer, says
the bus is about to leave and she thinks
that will be all. ,
Hopewood returns to normal. And
out in the sunbathing area Mrs. H—
breathes a sigh of relief and turns over
to do her back. There is just time for
one more layer . . .

These barrels hold the reasons
why Mildara Three Star Brandy
will taste the same this year,
next year, even ten years hence.
Fine Brandy is the sum of many different factors. The quality of
the original grapes. The skill of the distiller. The type of still.
The cask oak. The time of ageing. And, above all, the skill
of the blender. He subtly blends brandies of varying
ages to produce a consistent style which will not
change from year to year. Barrel One for example,
was laid down in 1936. Barrel Two in 1944,
Barrel Three, 1950, Barrel Four,
1961, Barrel Five, 1963 and Barrel
Six, 1966, the youngest spirit
allowed by Excise. There are many
other brandies of differing years
which, with the Blender’s art,
produce Mildara Three Star
Brandy. Consistently good, no
matter when you buy it.

LOOKING FOR PAY PACKETS
THAT NEVER COME
By SANDRA HALL
“THEY’RE VERY GLOOMY, aren’t
they?” someone said to me on the
first day of the UNESCO film and
television seminar in Sydney last week.
“They all seem to be looking for pay
packets that never come.”
He was right. Officially, more than
100 people in the industry had come
together to discuss the professional
training of film and television script-
writers, producers, and directors, but,
inevitably, all the devils had to be
exorcised first before anyone could get
down to anything as positive as train-
ing. Each session the chairman tried
to steer this narrow course and, admit-
tedly, most speakers managed to work
in somewhere some hint of the question
in hand often with an ingenious
deviousness. But all the familiar prob-
lems of this “not-quite-an-industry”
went on display in all their pessimism.
Stefan Sargent, who had collected a
Film Institute Award the night before
for his documentary on Groote Island
for the Commonwealth Film Unit, said
that for him the documentary-film
market was gently expiring, while Pro-
fessor Wal Cherry, of Flinders Univer-
sity, didn’t want anybody to sav
anything before they admitted that all
television was rubbish and Australian
television was worse than that. (“Un-
less at the same time a vigorous and
vital campaign is perpetrated on all
those people who produce the rubbish
what’s the use of talking about
training?”)
And what, specifically, were they to
do about it? somebody wanted to know,
asking Cherry to return to the micro-
phone. “For one thing, put some teeth
into the Broadcasting Control Board.
And for another put into operation
some of these schemes envisaged for the
young. People should not say, ‘That’s
what i do, and that’s what I’ve always
done.’ There should be general revolt
against the anti-intellectualism which a
lot of people in this business seem to
believe in. It seems to me that the
cameramen and the technicians get their
union rates and the ideas men get
what’s left. What is wrong with Aus-
tralia is repression.”
Fine rhetoric enough to unite any
army —■' but whether it’s enough to unite
the factional forces of the Australian
film and television business is something
else again. While some speakers were
prefacing their remarks with the phrase,
“I think we’re all agreed we need a
National Film School . . .” others were
maintaining there wasn’t enough work
around for those already in the industry.
And as the scriptwriters began to grow
more and more defensive at the repeated
aspersions cast on their work, somebody
raised the interesting point that in five
years, in these McLuhan-hypnotised
times, they might be redundant, any-
way. It was all beginning to work
dangerously into the circular “what
comes first the chicken or the egg?”
pattern that Lord Willis, the British
playwright imported for the seminar,
had warned against in his opening
speech on the first day.
He is to report to UNESCO on the
industry’s training needs, and in the
interests of his assignment has been to
all the capital cities, in addition to
Cairns. “My impression,” he said, “has
been one of great activity, with the
most stimulation coming from the
youngsters turning things out on
limited budgets with limited time. In
one small country station, I met an
Film-makers Stefan Sargent and Patrick
Ryan at the UNESCO seminar in
Sydney last week
18-year-old girl who conducts a 2v-hour
program, which meant she interviewed
me, got up and read the weather, then
did a news broadcast, then came back
to the interview. It’s hot-house TV,
but in a strange way effective.
“I’m alarmed by the lack of interest in
government circles in training for these
people. And it’s extraordinary that TV
is not protected. Everything else seems
to be.”
It was not without its relevance that
television commercials have developed
“under the umbrella of protection from
the government.”
Documentaries and news programs
were not yet “digging deep enough,”
or being sufficiently controversial,
while some politicians were being “a
little too sensitive about what is being
said and done on television, which
should stimulate and shock and
be one yard ahead of public taste.”
Drama was so far imitative and
below standard. “There’s the danger
of attempting to get into the interna-
tional market on one leg with some-
thing we call ‘the mid-Atlantic series.’
The paradox is that the truly interna-
tional program is the one that’s most
truly national.”
He was as saddened by the climate
for feature film-making as everybody
else by “the lack of willingness on
the part of businessmen to show interest
in the industry. It seems to me that
there’s far less risk in investing in film
than in some of the exploration going
on in the outback. But, instead, I hear
of producers taking second mortgages
on their houses begging and borrow-
ing to get money for films.
“Even if they asked 100,000 people
in Australia to invest $lO each, it might
work because the people down below
seem more interested.”
The recent all-Australian production
Eltham - Senior’s “Two Thousand
Weeks” was “not the best film I’ve
seen, but it is a fine film which shows
technique at least equal to the best in
Europe and the U.S. But I fear it may
not be a success. If it were called
'Belle de Jour’ and had sub-titles it
might achieve great success in France,
but it’s Australian, so I’m not sure.”
But he was sure about the need for
training schools along the lines of those
established by the smaller film-making
countries, the examples of which he
cited. Sweden came closest to Aus-
tralia’s situation, and there they had a
school financed by a ten percent levy
on box-office takings. This provided
$2 million a year, 65 percent of which
went directly to Swedish producers, five
percent into public relations, and 30
percent to administration, which
included the film school.
“This seminar could make this break-
through a positive one, so that in five
years I may find English talent is
knocking on your doors instead of the
other way around.”
Lord Willis may have been taking the
long view of an outsider, but in the
next two days that view was often
obscured, until at times it seemed as
if nobody knew what precisely they
wanted to lobby for. Was it an autono-
mous national film school? Was it a
school attached to a university? Was it
training courses run by management?
Was it training on the job? Was it
training at all?
A speaker from the TV technicians’
union came up with the hardly encour-
aging estimate that the industry at
present could absorb 15 people from a
training school, while Stefan Sargent
added his doleful story of diminishing
assignments.
“There are only two organisations—
the Commonwealth Film Unit and the
ABC —making documentaries continu-
ously. The ABC asked me for ideas
which I gave them, and they said were

great four months ago. And the Unit
has told me I'll have no more films
this year, and one next year.”
A 30-second commercial, he went
on, paid him more than an hour-long
documentary. “I’d starve on documen-
taries, and I could make between $3OO
and $lOOO a week, producing com-
mercials —but I don’t want to make
commercials,” he added to the astonish-
ment of a philistine neighbor of mine
who was muttering that he must be
mad.
“Perhaps we’ve lost touch with the
audience, and there’s something basic-
ally wrong with the product, because
the ratings are so poor the station
managements don’t care about me and
I doubt if people care about me either.
After the Project documentary I made
—‘Australian Londoners’ —I thought I
might get some letters, and I got two.
“I’ve made 500 little films , in the
past three years, and I regard myself
as trained, but I’ve got no work.”
Bob Raymond, of “Project ’68,”
wasn’t enthusiastic about the relevance
of formal training in his corner of the
industry either, and he managed to
make documentary film-making sound
like a cosy, improvisational business
sustained by a series of lucky hunches
with not much room for the tech-
nician or the trained scriptwriter.
“In 1964 we were planning a pro-
gram about Gallipoli. I’d read Alan
Moorehead’s book, which I thought was
the best thing done on the subject, and
I asked him to take part. He wasn’t
keen —he had no time to write any-
thing, he said. But I told him, you
don’t have to write anything. Just come
with us to Gallipoli and we’ll think of
something on the plane.
“So that’s what w'e did. He was a
writer who didn’t actually write any-
thing. We’d discuss it, then he’d say I
was thinking of saying this, and we’d
go ahead, with no rehearsals . . . one go.
“And he did this superbly, which was
an example of a writer not writing but
talking. Technical training wasn’t
needed there. If we employed a pro-
fessional writer on the staff, we’d have
to use him on things he’s not interested
in, so we prefer to use people from
outside.”
Raymond’s view, the original spark
which ignited Professor Cherry’s
diatribe against people saying "That’s
what I do and that’s what I’ve always
done,” held there was virtually no need
for professionally trained people in the
commercially produced television docu-
mentary. It also prompted somebody
to call three minutes’ silence “for the
poor editor who has to piece together
film shot by an untrained producer,
untrained director, and untrained script-
writer.”
Economics, Raymond averred, was
the problem. Stations could afford only
small staffs, which could not accom-
modate newly trained people. But, per-
haps, training schools could be set up
at existing studios, and trainees’ em-
ployment subsidised by a tax on the
industry or a contribution from it.
The industry should also establish a
sales organisation abroad to sell Aus-
tralian programs. “We’d get surprising
results from this, because other
countries are always sending their
teams out here to shoot their own
documentaries. If we had something to
show for them, it would be easier to
justify these programs and easier to
justify taking on trained people.”
Sam Lipski, executive producer of
“Four Corners,” had no doubts about
the need for training among public-
affairs reporters. Take them off air for
12 months, was his scheme, and send
them to university on full pay
“regularly, every few years. And send
them abroad to tell us what it’s like
regularly. It’s taken for granted that
academics have sabbaticals, so why not
sabbaticals for reporters, who influence
so many more people?”
Much of this, of course, is irrelevant
to Reg Goldsworthy, whose business is
backed by the American mbnolith
Lord Willis
makes his
views on our
film industry
known
Commonwealth United, in a series of
low-budget co-productions, none of
which seem to take more than a few
weeks, with American stars, of modest
lustre, flown in for a few days at a
time. If you’ve grown up on stories of
the extravagance of Hollywood, Mr.
Goldsworthy’s activities are salutary in
their unglamorous practicalities. But, as
people keep saying, the Australian film
industry has to start somewhere, even
if it is in the Americanised non-country
'in which Mr. Goldsworthy’s films are
set.
But, anyway, only a novelist, play-
wright, or a film-maker, and one with
a sense of the symbolic, at that, could
have thought of scheduling his speech
before one by Tim Burstall, director of
“Two Thousand Weeks,” so far the
closest thing we have to a contemporary
art film.
If they’d been casting a morality play
about Art and Commercialism, the
seminar’s organisers couldn’t have done
better. And Goldsworthy, probably
conscious of the fact, decided to play
the part. “Certainly, our operation is
in partnership with a big American
concern, and we’re not concerned with
artistry or even aesthetic values. But
we are providing an opportunity for
people to learn, and we are using Aus-
tralian space and equipment. We look
forward to the time when we do the
all-Australian thing.”

reply to Goldsworthy, Tim Burstall

said it was hard to know where to
begin. “I’m prepared to see overseas
involvement, but not on the terms Mr.
Goldsworthy is accepting. I know some-
thing like 80 percent of British films
arc underwritten by the Yanks, but
they’ve kept their national character be-
cause the tradition was already estab-
lished when the Americans entered.
“The danger involved with Mr.
Goldsworthy’s attitude is if you start
with very little tradition in feature
film-making, what happens when you
go into partnership with an American
organisation to satisfy their outlets?
Australian talent will be trained to this
other mould. Our cultural differences
are small, but important, and our
responsibility.”
Voicing the fears members of the
industry have expressed at times about
co-production deals, the next speaker
said Goldsworthy’s view worried him
because "it’s propaganda, inasmuch as
the more conservative elements in the
Government can believe from it that
we don’t want Government assistance."
All this was moving the seminar far
away from its declared topic—training,
as the discussion chairman, Myles
Wright, of the Broadcasting Control
Board, reminded everyone. But at the
end of the day he added another
piece of advice about what should
happen after the talking had to stop.
"Lord Willis will make a report to
UNESCO. But that’s all. Nothing else
whatever will happen unless you your-
selves are ready to fight on and achieve
some results.” '
Roland Beckett, of the Producers
and Directors’ Guild, had marked these
points as urgent —"some reinvestment
of money earned here by overseas tele-
vision and film companies; partial self-
generating finance to get the industry
rolling; Commonwealth-wide protection
in the showing of films; co-production
treaties with Canada, America, Japan,
or mutual co-operation guarantees in
regard to the employment of Aus-
tralians; better access to foreign
markets; restrictions on work permits
for overseas people, in accordance with
those of other countries; means to
attract Australian talent working
abroad scholarships, for example, as
well as scholarships to send experienced
Australians abroad.”
As the hall emptied, people began
to indulge in the usual scepticism
about the effectiveness of so much talk,
and someone, a little more hopeful than
the rest, said talk was still the only
way things got done. “Some bloke in
a government department gets a note
from the department head telling him
to do something about so-and-so, and
he looks back in Hansard to see who
had any good ideas.”
Whether or not government works
in such arbitrary ways, last week’s talk
must certainly give the newly formed
film industry committee to advise the
Australian Council for the Arts some-
thing to think about

SOPS AND INCENTIVES
By BRIAN HOAD
WHAT AMOUNTED to a $300,000
tax-free bonus landing in the lap of
Lend Lease’s managing director, Bill
Leavey, back in September, should
guarantee beyond all reasonable doubt
that stock-option incentives for execu-
tives are here to stay. For 20 years and
more, with frank avarice, the idea has
been hailed throughout the U.S. as
the biggest business sop yet devised.
It has spread through some 60 percent
of American corporate structures. Yet,
despite an Australian debut in 1962,
it has not yet caught on. To some
extent this is a reflection of a lack of
professional management, and the all-
pervasiveness of the family firm where
vested interests are considered incen-
tive enough. Now, however, the demand
for professionals is growing, supply is
still sadly limited, and competition is
hot. Just how hot Lend Lease has now-
demonstrated.
Accepting the spread of the idea
as inevitable and a rash of incentive
schemes based on it as imminent,
then there is need for legislation
to provide a blueprint. As things
stand, the field is wide open for
abuse. The only pertinent refer-
ence w'ithin the Companies Act
provides that options w'hich re-
main unexercised for five years
or more are void. Yet, even there,
an eager tax-adviser has dreamt
up a scheme w'hereby, through the
issue of convertible notes paid
up only to a nominal amount,
even that shred of bureaucratic
interference can be shaken off
without impairing the overall
intention. None the less, Aus-
tralia’s three main practitioners
laid out in their individual
schemes the bare bones of a
more or less acceptable set of rules.
First you get down to assessing your
senior staff in terms of their individual
contribution toward the overall profit-
rr i •
' 1 } °. .5 c ropany a re res ing
idea in itself, where so many so-called
wage policies are based willy-nilly on
any con.videraLon but that. \ou then
divide them into groups of ascending
impoitance to the company and hand
out the options in packets of
appropriate size.
For some inscrutable reason, the face
value of the options handed out is set
at 90 percent of the market value at
the time of issue, a rather irrelevant
and enlarged reflection of a tax-fiee
five percent margin allowed by U.S.
legislation. Yet the Deputy Commis-
sioner of Taxation in Sydney has, for
reasons best known, to himself, decided
that a ten percent margin is quite all
right by him. -
The options cannot then be exercised
for a period of at least two years unless
the company makes a bonus issue, when
the options may be exercised im-
mediately. Any profit from the exercise
and sale of the stock is again tax-free
on the grounds that only capital gain is
involved. But should the practice
become widespread, it is not going to
be too difficult to argue that profits so
acquired are not capital gain at all,
but a standard component of an
executive’s pay-packet.
Lend Lease pioneered the way with
tw'o somewhat tentative issues in 1962
and 1963. There was a pause in 1964,
and then in 1965 came a massive issue
to 38 executives of 775,000 options, in
consideration of w’hich all previous
issues w'ere relinquished. When, in the
following annual report, details of the
issue were made public an extraordinary
pattern for a hierarchy was indicated;
37 executives received packets of 10,000
and 25,000 options, while towering
above them all stood the managing
director Bill Leavey with a massive
300,000. How the 37 felt, despite their
own sops, at the public disclosure that
Bill Leavey, of Lend
Lease
Warwick Holcroft, of
Brambles Industries
Leavey was worth at least 12 of them
t 0 t ' ie company has never been
recorded. .
The options of 19fi5 were not exercrs-
able before 1969, but with the one-tor-
ten bonus issue last September they
became immediately sO . At the same
time, Lend Lease announced a further
issue of 700,000 options to be spread
among 165 executives divided into
f oul - strata of importance.
The p ecu Ji ar ities of the system at
Lend Lease inc i ude the heavy weighting
0 f the managing director in an other-
wise flat hierarchy, the decision to make
that common knowledge and the hold-
mg period of at least four years in
normal circumstances. Behind them
l ay the company’s certain reputation
for being one of the best poaching
grounds for executives in Australia. The
options were not so much an incentive
scheme as a scheme to stabilise the
executive workforce. Leavey’s heavy
weighting was something of a reaction
to the departure of joint-managing
director David Elsworth in April, 1965.
From the shareholders’ point of view,
if the system is an incentive to gener-
ally improve the fortunes of the com-
pany and thereby profit the share-
holders as well and there can be no
other justification for it the possi-
bility of executives reaping gains from
the short-term fluctuations of the share-
market rather than from their own
efforts to improve the lot of the com-
pany must be avoided. If it is an
incentive, it is a long-term incentive.
And yet the longer the holding period
is spun out the less of an incentive it
becomes to the executives. Lend Lease
has chosen the longest time possible
within the maximum five-year period
imposed by law.
And how well from the crudest point
of view of the shareholders has the
incentive worked? The company profit
in the year of the massive option issue,
1965, stood at $1.35 million from which
it has slowly risen to $1.68 million; not
a brilliant achievement, but during that
period massive projects like Australia
Square had been in the profitless
construction stage. Profits over
the next five years are expected
to move ahead much more
rapidly in anticipation of w'hich
the sharemarket marked the com-
pany’s stock up from a high of
about $1 in 1965 to a high of
$2.15 this year. The option-
holders were happy and so, says
Leavey, were the shareholders
when the new option issue was
announced at the annual meeting
in September. But the feelings
of the shareholders are essentially
irrelevant. As legislation stands,
they have no say in the matter
whatsoever, whether or not or
how' the system should continue.
The most obvious difference in
the option system operated by Hanimex,
since 1963, is that the board have
quite simply refused to disclose the
structure of the company’s hierachy.
Some 95 employees are involved “from
senior executives down to factory fore-
men,” but how they figure in relative
importance to Hanimex is Hanimex’s
concern and nobody else’s. Share
options, some 190,000 in all, have been
distributed among them by way of a
trustee system.
There is something to be said for
shedding the veils of mystery which
surround the salary and status levels
of employees. After all, it doesn’t take
a very shrewd observer to note the
intracompany resentments, real or
imaginary, which proliferate because of
them. On the other hand, unless your
assessments of relative worth are on a
very sound basis indeed and clearly
explicable, matters are only going to be
made worse by public acclaim and the
inevitable discredit which goes with it.
Even for the most superbly handled
assessments, publication is a serious

step. Self-esteem is a much misunder-
stood and illogical beast.
And yet shareholders have every
right to demand to know to whom
all those share options are being handed
out and why. In the U.S., their right is
•defended by law and their approval
is required at a general meeting. With-
out some such provision there exists
the possible danger of a substantial
number of shares falling into the hands
of the executives, so creating a power-
ful voting block which could lead to
inside trading and further distortions
of the sharemarket. What is to prevent
a gloomily misleading piece of news
emerging from “sources within the
company” when options are about to
be granted? What is to prevent a bout
of heavy selling to help things along
still further?
Hanimex have bent over backwards
to appease any shareholder’s suspicions.
For a start they have set a limit of
250,000 shares or roughly ten percent
of the company’s capital on staff option
issues. It has imposed the four-year
holding period and, further than that,
has insisted that participants must not
only buy their shares after that period
but must hold them for another two
years before selling. Many executives
might feel that it is unreasonable for
an incentive scheme to require them to
tie up their savings for a couple of
years. Others may consider that the
Hanimex scheme has softened the
inherent incentive to the point of use-
lessness. The final consideration for
everyone is that, since the scheme was
introduced, the company’s profits have
risen healthily from $381,000 to
$704,000.
The latest company to join in the
game and it is a game in which
all participants must know the rules,
the eligibility requirements, the basis
on which efforts are to be measured,
the prize for winning, and the penalty
for losing is Brambles Industries.
And there the idea has evolved as an
integral part of an overall manage-
ment plan rather than simply being
slipped in as the fattest carrot on the
market.
If Lend Lease has tended to
disregard the mysterious workings of
self-esteem and Hanimex has gone in
fear of it, Brambles under the influence
of its general manager, Warwick Hol-
croft, has spent considerable time
exploring it through the longueurs of
the typists’ pools, the clouds of listless
resentment which can hover over the
sales office, the branch manager’s
incipient ulcer, the filthy tempers
which disturb the executives’ dining-
room and the nervous indigestion at the
boardroom table.
One result has been the development
of a salary structure which Holcroft
believes leaves little to be desired: “If
anyone has to come and ask for a salary
rise, then I know that somewhere along
the line management has failed to
carry out its job properly.”
The very idea that wage packets
should match up to an employee’s
self-esteem cannot but help seem

WHY ARE OLD
PERSIAN RUGS SO
SUCCESSFUL IN
MODERN INTERIORS?
Architects are among our most
enthusiastic customers for old rugs.
Because these rugs are one of the few
art forms still hand made of natural
materials by peasants and nomads,
they are particularly suitable for
modern homes with their emphasis on
natural materials. Architects appreci-
ate the way these rugs actually im-
prove in appearance with age as
colours mellow and the marks of use
add character. They know that they
will always have a validity regardless
of changing styles, and have dis-
covered that in their variety they are
not only a superb foil to the clean
lines of modern architecture, they add
the human element so often lacking
in the interiors of today.
We stock only those rugs still pro-
duced under the authentic conditions
and we try as far as possible to select
pieces of genuine artistic merit
whether the rug costs $BO or $4,000.
We certify every piece we sell.

slightly absurd in a general climate
where salaries are secretively handed
out for any reason from social standing
through talent, age, and length of
service to the blueness of a pair of
eyes; where one man has no idea what
the next man is getting, let alone what
he is doing or how well he is doing
it, and as often as no f the management
are not much more enlightened. The
system might well be traditional but
its arbitrariness makes it very difficult
for any incentive scheme along the
option lines to work at all effectively.
Such a scheme demands the logical
basis of the measured effect of each
employee’s job on the overall profit-
ability of the company. There are ways
and means of doing that, as advocated
by the management consultants, with
mathematical precision. There are
commonsense considerations, too, like
turnover achieved, assets controlled,
number of subordinates answerable
for, number of superiors answerable to.
and so on. This is common ground for
salary scales and incentive schemes
alike. Without it, salary structures just
go on bruising self-esteem and evoke
ulcers, incentive schemes become com-
pletely unjustifiable.
Still pursuing his investigations of
self-esteem, Holcroft proceeded to
decentralise Brambles into eight more
or less autonomous divisions controlling
a proliferation of branches throughout
every State. Outside basic financial
matters, the parent company in Sydney
dropped its headquarters image and
became a servicing centre. But although
self-esteem in the divisions was further
appeased, it became apparent that the
process could go too far, with the
divisions developing selfish attitudes to
the detriment of the group as a whole.
Holcroft wanted an adjusting factor
toward “whole-company attitudes.”
Some sort of incentive scheme was
an obvious choice, particularly for a
company operating in the service
industries. Holcroft makes this last
point concisely “3500 employees
with an asset backing of $35 million and
a profit of $2.3 million last year.”
Employees are one of Brambles’ major
assets. As in all service industries,
profit depends on an intricate maze of
good company-customer relationships.
The share - option scheme became
inevitable.
And still Holcroft’s interest in self-
esteem was at work. He wanted the
option scheme to be “a form of public
acclaim on how we value our staff and
how they fit into the hierarchy.” One
hundred and eighty “senior staff” were
selected and separated into eight grades
of importance; not such a difficult task
when you have as much confidence in
the logical soundness of your salary
structure as Holcroft has, though it
still took six months of discussion to
finally sort the assessments out. That
the final decisions would be published
was a foregone conclusion; that they
should be as fair and as accurate as
possible was imperative.
In September, 306,500 share options
were distributed accordingly. The incen-
tive aspect was maximised with a mini-
mum holding period of two years, and
no strings attached after that.
At the annual general meeting, true
to the form of their American counter-
parts, the shareholders remained
indifferent to the whole affair. They
could have brought up the obvious com-
plaint that the scheme was diluting
company capital; it would have been
pointed out that that could hardly be
so, because each share had a backing
of only 90 cents, whereas the face value
of the options was $1.65. A very per-
ceptive shareholder could then have
gone on to argue that despite this, part
of the present market value of the
shares is based upon the right to bene-
fit from future improvement and that
this benefit was being diluted Mr.
Leavey’s $300,000 was not created by
alchemy. The answer to that is perhaps
best tackled along the line that the very
scheme itself was adding to the poten-
tial for future improvement. Share-
holders could ■ have asked why, since
U.S. legislation imposed a minimum
holding period of three years on the
options, Brambles had decided on two
years, which would have meant explain-
ing the theory of maximised incentives.
They might even have queried that ten
percent margin between face value and
market value on the date of issue,
except that on the day of the general
meeting, the market value had fallen
to the face value, and, anyway, that was
a matter of more interest to the tax
people.
In what is the third major attempt
by an Australian company to tackle
the problems of using stock options as
an incentive for executives, Brambles
have come up with a scheme which
appears to leave little room for com-
plaint from any quarter, though legis-
lation to protect the rights of share-
holders and clarify the tax position of
executives involved is still unavoidable.
At the same time, it becomes obvious
that such incentives are not the sort
of thing for amateur managements to
tinker with. They are the products of
sophisticated professionals dependent
for their proper success on the pro-
fessionalism of the underlying manage-
ment structure. Such schemes, too, have
the inherent danger of aligning manage-
ment interests with those of the share-
holders to the point of alienating the
general workforce to the position of
just another exploitable commodity,
and only an enlightened management
blue-collar superannuation schemes
are not enough can counteract that.
Unfortunately, the spread of such sys-
tems will probably be quite independ-
ent of any consideration that so .many
Australian companies, still in the
antiquated grip of family-firm tradi-
tions, have a long way to go yet, before
either their management structures or
their staff relationships can meet these
prerequisites. But there is nothing to
stop the spread.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Wheeling and dealing across a credibility gap
IN ONE BROAD SENSE it does not
matter whether a secret agreement
between the Government and Esso-
BHP existed or not. What does matter
is that the Government allowed the
affair to blow up last week without one
official word of confirmation or denial.
What does matter is the growing “air
of uncertainty” which Sir Maurice
Mawby, chairman of CRA, somewhat
urgently noted and criticised before the
assembled lights- of Melbourne’s busi-
ness world last Thursday night. And
what does matter is that the Govern-
ment’s credibility gap is becoming so
boundless that anything could happen.
The afterbirth of Mr. Gorton’s oil
policy, claimed to have been discovered
in Canberra last week, a month and
more after the event, raised tempers,
confusion, and uncertainty, but it did
not raise disbelief. A secret deal
between the Government and Esso-BHP
which, by arranging details of the
so-called oil policy in the companies’
favor to compensate for defaulting on
the old agreement, is on the cards. An
agreement which would impose such
restrictions on the import of foreign
crude oil as to raise the price of
petroleum products or make redundant
those refineries which handle the pro-
ducts in which local crude is deficient,
is credible, too. Nobody is criticising
any more the broad outlines of the plan
as disclosed by the Prime Minister on
October 10. But details late revealed
could, say the oilmen, cost them dearly.
They suspect some stiff restrictions on
the imports of crude oil, quite apart
from an import parity which the oil-
men now consider to be unfairly high.
Imports of crude, for example, cannot
be used for any purpose where Aus-
tralian crude may be used instead; it
can only be imported to the extent of
filling the gaps left by the local crude;
and if those gaps involve certain
petroleum products, such as fuel oil,
lubricating oil, and bitumen, in which
the local oil is so far deficient, then it
is the products themselves which are to
be allowed in rather than the crude
from which to manufacture those
products.
Clearly, the refining companies with-
out a stake in the local crude are ready
to receive a much harder slap in the
face than they at first expected. Not
only would such an agreement further
the amount of crude they will be able
to take from overseas affiliates but it
would restrict their efficiency, too, by
disregarding the fact that that depends
on blending the crudes according to
the type of products required. Adding
insult to financial injury is the greater
dependence on Esso, an erstwhile com-
petitor in the refining and marketing
fields* which all this could impose.
BP’s $10 million lubricating oil complex
at Kwinana—virtually redundant?
So on the cards, too, is the idea of
rebellious oil companies shipping in
crude in contempt of any such policy,
knowing full well that legislation to
bring them to heel would probably not
survive the Senate DLP leader
Senator Gair is ever ready to use his
balance of power to block any Gov-
ernment manoeuvre which would
result in higher prices for oil products.
The reasoning behind a secret deal
is wide open for supposition, too.
Among the more charitable it has been
suggested that, despite the confidence
and relish with which Mr. Gorton has
been demonstrating his grasp of the
detailed intricacies of the oil industry,
it was not perhaps strong enough to
justify the unusual course of settling
the new policy through face-to-face
meetings with the experts of Esso-BHP.
Nor should it be forgotten, either, that
at the time of the new oil policy
announcement on October 10 the tacti-
cal carte blanche of a 1968 election was
still around.
But secret deal or not for whatever
reason, the “air of uncertainty” has
thickened, as if the defaulting on the
original oil policy, the current, confus-
ing lack of oil exploration incentives,
the MLC affair, and the Government’s
querulous statements on foreign invest-
ment in general were not enough to be
groping through.
In the face of growing overseas sus-
picions, Sir Maurice Mawby has net
bpen alone amongst the heads of
industry, particularly the minerals
industry, in calling for "cool analysis
rather than emotional outpourings,” for
“the cultivation of a patient view a
long view of things.” And no doubt with
the backing of a seemingly irrepressible
minerals boom all manner of things
shall be well in the end. But what a
tarnished and tawdry interlude the
“new nationalism” is turning out to be
in the meantime.
TARIFF POLICY
RATTIGAN'S REPLY
IN HIS FIRST COMMENTS on the
reception given his latest annual report,
1 ariff Board chairman Alf Rattigan
has come out with another impressive
reply to critics. This is in his Monash
economics lecture delivered on Mon-
day last.
“The primary objective of tariff
making in Australia,” he says, “is to
encourage the efficient use of resources
in protected industries and a high level
of economic growth.” Protectionist
arguments that tariffs need to be
tailored to maintain full employment
and external payments balance are dis-
missed. “Fiscal and monetary measures
and, if necessary, quantitative restric-
tions or exchange rate adjustments are
the major measures for these purposes.”
Mr. Rattigan made his most out-
spoken criticism yet of the traditional
reference procedure whereby inquiries
arise mainly from complaints of manu-
facturers troubled by import competi-
tion. This, of course, tends to generate
a “creeping increase in the level and
width of protection.” Protection tends
to go to products whose costs are rising
relative to others, while processes with
a better performance tend not to get
referred to the Board. He pointed out
that one important provision of the Act
under which the Board operates says
that the Minister is required to refer to
it “the necessity for new, increased, or
reduced duties.” This has not, for many
activities, been complied with, said Mr.
Rattigan.
“Continuing pressures for the review
of ‘inadequate’ duties and the absence
of countervailing pressures for the
review of ‘excessive’ duties, have helped
to produce highly selective procedures
for tariff revision which are preoccu-
pied with local cost disadvantages and
are, as a result, conducive to a creeping
increase in both the level and width of
protection. The highly selective nature
of ad hoc tariff making, and in particu-


lar its traditional concentration on
activities needing additional protection,
thus introduces an upward bias to
changes in the tariff,” Mr. Rattigan
argued.
A more serious inadequacy of tradi-
tional procedures, in his view, is that,
“They have tended to exclude inter-
dependent processes which do not need
increased protection. The Board’s
individual inquiries have consequently
tended to be concerned with groups of
activities which need more protection
rather than with groups of activities
which are technically or economically
related.
Thirdly, traditional tariff revision
procedures have given the Board no
opportunity to “assess and compare the
protective requirements and economic
merits of tariff-dependent industries.
Only by making such comparisons,
however, can a basis be found for
judging the relative worth to the
economy of particular tariff-protected
activities.
“Working - as it has been with
a very limited knowledge of the tariff-
protected sector as a whole, it has been
quite possible for the Board to regard
a particular industrial activity which
happened to be under inquiry at a
particular time as economic or uneco-
nomic without being aware of, or
having standards for assessing, the
extent to which other Australian
industrial activities are more or less
economic. This assumes greater impor-
tance when we remember that the
relatively less economic industries
could, under the traditional system,
continue to enjoy very high tariff pro-
tection indefinitely and -- because of
the operation of the highly protected
dragnet items in the tariff could
continue to expand their range of pro-
ducts.”
Finally, the old system prevents the
Board from “exercising its judgment
fully on all relevant issues arising from
its inquiries.” This was something the
Prime Minister told the Board that
it must do. Its inquiries into activities
which need more protection rather
than those which are related tech-
nically or economically to one another
has “tended to focus the Board’s
attention on cost and price disadvan-
tages, and to produce recommendations
which were designed to compensate for
those disadvantages often without
sufficient opportunity to consider the
effects on related processes and, where
necessary, to recommend changes in
the protection accorded those related
processes.”
Mr. Rattigan said that what was
needed was a systematic sequence of
tariff inquiries rather than the present
haphazard response to manufacturers
in trouble. His classification as pub-
lished in the annual report is, of course,
designed to provide such a sequence.
He wants an end to the phony practice
of the Government writing the report
it wants into the reference and using
the Board as a PR outfit. And the
Board needs better statistics.
MEN AND MATTERS
REDLAND LTD, the offeror for 51
percent of Concrete Industries (Monier)
capital, has an executive chairman with
plenty of experience in the takeover
game. In his last annual address Mr.
A. F. F. Young claimed a high success
ratio 23 sucessful bids against three
failures or withdrawals in the past 13
years. He sees Monier as fundamentally
a good business, engaged in exactly
parallel business to Redland, “so it fits.”
Redland has accumulated expertise,
and Young thinks the rewards for Red-
land and the remaining shareholders in
Monier would be fantastic.
Although Redland is still expanding
in the U.K, the horizon is limited on
“this little isle,” as Young puts it. The
company’s great growth has been in
Europe, where it found a fine partner in
Herr Braas and set up a tileworks in
Frankfurt in 1953. In the following 15
years it has set up one tile factory ( a
Ian McMullin
A. F. F. Young
year in Germany, and all factories
work at capacity 24 hours a day. Two
years ago Redland and Braas joined
Bredero of Holland in setting up in
Utrecht, and Redland-Braas-Bredero
now has five works producing in
Holland, France, Italy, Sweden, and
Switzerland, with a second works in
Italy and one to start up operations in
Belgium.
The funds required for the Monier
takeover, about $l4 million estimated
at 80 cents a share, will come from
Germany. Young has a flair for cur-
rency shuffles and proudly asserts that
the lucrative German business, which
now earns £stg.l.6 million a year,
required only one cash outflow from
Britain of £stg.6ooo.
Young qualified as a chartered
accountant in 1928, but while he was
still articled, and doing the audit for
Redhill Tile Co. as it was known then,
his employers had to obtain special
dispensation from the Institute to
enable him to accept a seat on the
board. After qualifying memories of
a bygone era he spent a year of
leisure, escorting debs to balls. When it
was discovered the managing director
.of Redhill was building houses and
tiling them with company roofing tiles
without going through the formality of
paying for them, Young was free to
accept the managing directorship
offered to him at a salary of £5OO a
year. Since 1955, Redland has made
seven bonuses as well as numerous cash
issues, and a £stg. 18 investment in
March. 1955, would now be worth
£stg.293.
INDUSTRIAL diversification means
different things to different people. The
more astute company boards, which
sometimes have to let the chairman in-
dulge his diverse predilections (say like
National Consolidated’s for greeting
cards in a world of automotive com-
ponents and accessories), turn a blind
eye while they get on with the main
job and moneyspinner. But when both
chairman and managing director are
bitten by the same off-beat bug and
they happen to be brothers, as in the
ase of Bruce and lan McMullin of
Spotless, the dry-cleaning people, the
best of boards can be hard put to it
to keep the company’s eye on the main
ball and field-of-profit play.
The dry-cleaning business has a cer-
tain typical history the world over, of
firms springing up with mushroom
speed only to find the hard, cruel hand
of competition force them into rival
camps where their good names vanish
into thin air. Not so Spotless. In its
time, Spotless, which was started un-
pretentiously (by lan at the age of 19),
in Smith Street, Fitzroy, shortly after
the war, and now has a turnover of
about million and plants all over
the place, has clawed in its fair share
of rivals, including Top Four last
year.
Somewhere along the line, however,
the McMullin brothers tasted Kentucky
fried chicken, the dish that Colonel
Skinner has made a fortune from in the
U.S., and which Sydney has already
taken to its palate. So they’ve bought
one of two franchises to set up special
KFC restaurants (diamond-shaped
buildings) in Victoria (the other is
held by a Mr. Rice . . .) and are lead-
ing Spotless into the eating business in
a big way. The first of the company’s
special KFC restaurants will be com-
pleted on Dandenong Road (where
Springvale Road crosses it), in mid-
December, and negotiations are pro-
ceeding for the company to establish
four more at strategic points on the
main out-of-town highways.
The driving force behind this odd
diversification' is lan, the managing
director, a man who, even at 42, and
with a family of five children, goes for
a three-mile run around Como Park
every morning that is when he’s
not travelling around the State and
overseas (he’s already made eight trips
to America and now has his KFC
manager over there studying the latest
refinements in the chicken business)..

Speculator’s Diary
THAT WAS THE WEEK
THAT WAS, AND
OIL'S STILL THE WORD
NOW THAT IS THE SORT of week
I like! I took the plunge last week and
didn’t dent my head on the bottom;
because it looks as if the bottom has
really passed at last. A fortnight ago I
ventured the opinion that the time had
come for a speculator to try his luck
once again and that the worst had
passed. Now even the chartists seem to
be agreeing; last week’s gloomy fore-
casts (Western Mining at $6 and all
that sort of stuff) have changed to
optimistic expectations (now WMC is
set for a rise to $l3 instead of collaps-
ing further after all). Well, there is one
thing about the chartists: their predic-
tions help themselves come true. Once
they start their buying because the
market is in an uptrend, there will be
an uptrend, because there have been
precious few sellers around at recent
low prices.
But the main reason for my pleasure
at the moment is the oil market. Last
week I bought AOG, Oil Search, Exoil
options, and Genoa options, and all of
them have risen nicely, thank you. And
so, of course, have my existing hold-
ings of Woodside, Ampol, Associated
Continental, Alliance, and Amalga-
mated. I’m recouping my losses at a
great rate in oil, and I reckon I’m
going to make a lot more money out of
the oil market in coming weeks. The
main reason is that the news from
Legendre is of real significance to the
whole oil search in the areas off the
coast of north-west Western Australia.
This is what was needed to restore
everyone’s confidence in the prospect of
finding oil elsewhere than at Barrow
Island. I’ve already got some Woodside
and some Genoa, which will also get a
kick along from Legendre’s news. But
the stock that should benefit most is
clearly Ampol Exploration, whose one-
seventh interest in neighboring Wapet
is made look a lot more exciting by
this find across its northern border. In
addition, Woodside’s next well, which
should spud-in in a couple of weeks, is
even closer to Ampol Exploration, and
what is good news for Woodside in this
will be good news for Ampol Explora-
tion, too.
My Abrolhos purchase is simply to
give myself greater cover over the W.A.
coast. After all, the company’s first well
which was completed last week did
everything that was asked of it. This
was called a stratigraphic well, not an
oil exploration well, and I believe the
structure information it provided is of
major significance. Let’s remember that
it was drilled on an island for
economy’s sake and not from an off-
shore rig, so that it was clearly not
situated on the most promising location
kin the area. But now the problem of
finding the best spot for an offshore
well is made a lot easier.
The week’s sales brought in two very
handsome profits. Western Collieries
proved to be one of my best profit
earners for the year. I’ve reluctantly
decided to get rid of my last 500 as I
think the stock may have had most of
the rise it is likely to get in the short
run and I’m getting a little disturbed
at the suggestions that Eastern States
coal may be preferred to W.A. coal in
future iron-ore processing plans. My
sale this week brought in a profit of
$240.
The other sale was naturally King
Island Scheelite. When I bought this
stock, I did so because it presented a
cheaper way into Peko-Wallsend and
so I sold my Pekos in order to make
the switch. But when Consolidated
Goldfields came back into the act I
held on for one simple reason: it has
always been my golden rule to buy into
a fight (which, by the way, is the
reason I’m holding on to my Concrete
Industries Monier shares as this looks
like an ideal scene for a battle). But
now that Peko has come back once
again to pay what looks to me to be a
fantastic price for KIS, I’ve decided to
take my profits and run. I simply
cannot see Peko shares holding their
current price after this takeover goes
through (and this time I cannot see any
likelihood of a further counter-bid from
Consolidated Goldfields unless it knows
a lot more about KIS than the market
does). So I’m passing up this oppor-
tunity to get into Peko at a cheaper
price than the current market; I’ll look
again after the tumult and the shouting
and the selling dies away. Anyway, my
KIS sale netted me $335, which I
regard as a highly satisfactory operation
over the short space of two months.
All this leaves kitty at $6173, in
readiness for next week’s declaration of
a dividend from my fund for the year.

BRIEFLY
The economy: The Minister for Trade, Mr. J. McEwen,
agrees that the Federal Government’s car industry plan is
facing problems and that these problems warrant con-
sideration . . . Japan and Australia are likely to be arguing
again about the pricing of “completely knocked-down”
car imports . . . European car-makers are also in trouble,
being charged by the Customs Department with dumping.
A prominent local oil refiner, Boral Ltd., now finds the
Federal Government’s crude oil pricing and marketing
policy “totally unacceptable”; the oil industry is disturbed
by the apparent existence of an “agreement” between the
Government and Esso-BHP.
New and increased loan commitments by the trading
banks jumped in the four weeks ended October 9,
principally as a result of a rise in term loans for special
projects; overdraft lending moved higher than September,
yet remained below the average for the previous six
months.
The chairman of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia,
Sir Maurice Mawby, warmly defended the need for overseas
-capital, especially in mining ventures, and thought
Australians were becoming “a little querulous” about it.
The markets: Well, the Australian share markets were
asking for some vivid stimulus and they duly got it: bids
(of all kinds), counter-bids, partial amalgamations, oil
dealings built upon a strike—you name it, we have nearly
all of it. So the indexes looked rather healthier and even
the industrials gave signs of general movement.
Some “special situations” meant very strong responses.
Drug Houses leapt 65 cents to $2.40, while Slater Walker
put on another 60 cents to finish at $6.50. Burns Philp
gained 16 cents and Mauri Bros. 36 cents. Henry Jones
exultantly added 50 cents, closing at $3.90. A mining trio
saw quite a lot of jockeying: King Island Scheelite $16.70
(up $4.00), Consolidated Gold Fields $7.60 (up 30 cents),
and Peko $9.80 (down 40 cents).
Inflation and currency doubts perplexed many overseas
markets, yet London saw many gains among industrials,
which, however, were drifting again on Friday.
Technically strong, New York advanced well on rising
volumes.
Companies: So all week long the noise of takeovers
rolled, and an overseas contingent rode well in the van . . .
Slater Walker’s big-’un turned out to be Drug Houses of
Australia, now under seige to a combined share and
debenture offer worth around $27 million and pressurised
by a fair amount of market operation . . . Strained for
funds after a heavy acquisition program, transformer-maker
Tyree Industries has thrown itself open to its principal
licenser, Westinghouse Electric of U.S.A., which will oblige
by purchasing up to 75 percent of Tyree’s capital . . .
The British concrete fabricator, Redlands Holdings, is
chasing 51 percent of Concrete Industries at 80 cents cash
a share (worth in all $14.16 million); Concrete’s directors
unanimously believe the offer is inadequate and put forth
“don’t sell” advice . . . With a “first come, first served”
foray, Kempthorne Mistral secured some of Lawrence and
Hansen at $1.12 a share, then brazenly bid formally for
the rest at 92 cents a share . . . The saga of King Island
Scheelite stays unresolved, with Peko-Wallsend re-entering
with a much higher offer in reply to Consolidated Gold
Fields’ second attack (still embracing only 51 percent of
KIS).
Whatever lesson the above catalogue can teach has,
perhaps, been assimilated by the wise venerables Burns Philp
and Mauri Bros, and Thomson, who are to make a sizable
share exchange and forge closer business co-operation;
Burns Philp laid on the prestige with a 37 percent profit
leap (from $3,942,410 to $5,418,330), a dividend up from
10 to 12-| percent, and a one-for-five bonus issue which
won’t affect the higher dividend.
History has not jaded Henry Jones’ appetite for novelty:
a second bonus is on the way 41 years after the first and
the dividend goes from 12 to 14 percent —its second
increase in 29 years.
Among the other leaders, CSR kept its interim payout
at percent in line with the percent ruling for the
past five years.
On top of all these “happenings,” the miners couldn’t
dominate as usual . . . But Mount Isa is still on the
expansionary path, hinting at development of the northern
leases (away from the main lode) and projecting a major
new shaft; costs are still rising, principally of labor . . .
Steady was the word for Coal and Allied Industries, whose
latest $3,667,101 profit didn’t look much different from
the previous year’s $3,694,150 and the year before that . . .
Tasmania’s zinc miner and smelter, E.Z. Industries, plans
to spend $6.3 million on new plant to increase zinc output
by 22,000 tons a year and to be completed by the end of
1970 . . . Burmah-Wcodside’s Legendre No. 1 flowed a
small quantity of high-gravity oil, which the chairman
didn’t play up or play down; Woodside proposes a one-for-
one issue to raise $2.9 million.
Its Australian and New Zealand interests may be
floated off by Dalgety and New Zealand Loan, but not in
a hurry.
Melbourne’s Herald and Weekly Times is to make its
third one-for-two bonus in ten years and plans an articles
change to disallow purchase of its shares by companies
which have other links with TV stations . . . The
Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia thinks
companies shouldn’t object to reasonably qualified accounts
and certainly shouldn’t sack the auditors making them.

COMENG
ADDRESS BY CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS
to the
Annual General Meeting of Stockholders
of COMENG HOLDING LIMITED held of
The A.M.P. Theatrette, Ground Floor, A.M.P. Building, Sydney Cove, on 12th NOVEMBER, 1968.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It affords me pleasure to welcome you to
this 22nd Annual General Meeting of Stock-
holders of Comeng Holdings Limited.
The Balance Sheet of the Company as at
30th June, 1968, and the Profit and Loss
Account for the year ended on that date
together with the Reports thereon from your
Directors and ;the Company’s Auditors were
forwarded to you with the Notice convening
this meeting. May I, therefore, assume that
I have your approval to take these documents
as read?
You will have observed that the Consolidated
Profit for the Group rose by 7.6% to
$1,941,453 or approximately twice the earnings
of four years ago. However, after deduction
of the net interest of outside shareholders in
the Company’s three partly owned subsidaries,
the Consolidated profit for the year available
to Comeng Holdings Limited fell by 0.58%
from $1,107,962 to $'1,085,349, and the ratio
of these earnings to the issued capital of the
Company fell marginally from 28.4% to 27.8%.
For a variety of reasons, the result for the
latest year may be considered as quite
satisfactory.
You may rest assured that your Directors
are far removed from being complacent about
the Company’s earnings history, and their
attention is presently being directed towards
avenues for increasing the Company’s
profitability and earning stability.
The continuing high level of competition in
the Railway Rolling Stock Industry in Aus-
tralia continues, and was to some extent
aggravated during the year bv the generally
low level of work offering in the general
engineering field.
The competitive position is best illustrated
by statistics which amply demonstrate that
the selling price of equipment in the above
industries has not risen at anything like the
rate at which the cost of living has increased
in Australia over the past decade, and some
equipment is being sold currently at prices
even lower than the price secured for com-
parable equipment four or five years ago.
A further adverse factor was the industrial
unrest which followed the initial impractical
decision in the Federal Metal Trades Work
Value Judgment.
These adverse factors in Australia were, to
some extent, offset by a higher profit earned
in South Africa during the year, and as I
will mention later in this address it appears
likely that the reverse position will apply
during the 1968/69 year, in that the earnings
in South Africa are expected to drop tem-
porarily, and the Australian earnings are
forecast to improve slightly.
Indeed, it is safe to say that a significant
reason for the Company’s continued strength
is its diversification through plants in the
different States of Australia and in South
Africa, and its decreasing dependence on the
rolling stock and engineering contracting
industry.
I will now pass to a brief review of our
operations in Australia and South Africa:
AUSTRALIA:
Since I last addressed you, the Comeng
Group has secured and processed a number
of interesting contracts in the various Aus-
tralian plants. These include:
1. 59 Stainless Steel Coaches for the Sydney/
Perth Passenger Service.
2. Structural Steel for Bridge construction for
Mt. Newman Railway System.
3. 50 Aluminium Hopper Wagons for N.S.W.R.
4. 280 Bogie Open Wagons for N.S.W.R.
5. Comeng/Koehring Telescopic Boom Travel-
ling Cranes.
6. 280 Aluminium Coal Hopper Wagons.
7. 200 Iron Ore Wagons for Hamersley Iron
Ore Pty. Limited.
8. Sheep Vans for Commonwealth Railways.
9. Car Carrying Vehicles for Commonwealth
Railways.
You will, no doubt, have read some of the
background of these various contracts in the
daily press, and I do not propose to elaborate
upon them further at this stage, other than
to point to them as a significant contribution
being made by your Company to the undoubted
growth taking place in Australia today.
We believe that equipment supplied in
Australia by the Comeng Group is of the
highest standard of workmanship and
materials, and embodies the more noteworthy
advances in design and manufacturing
techniques available throughout the world
Indeed, Comeng has initiated many innova-
tions which have added appreciably to the
prestige of its products, but it must be
acknowledged that the high level of com-
petition ootaining in both the rolling stock
and heavy engineering industries precludes
Australian manufacturers from spending tne
large amounts which are needed if really
worthwhile original research and development
is to be carried out in these industries. The
Group has endeavoured to participate in the
inducements offered by the Commonwealth
Government in its scheme for Industrial
Research and Development Grants, but
benefits received therefrom will not be of a
major importance in our railway or certain
engineering operations as the Grants Scheme
does not extend to tne building of prototype
equipment, whereas the building of a prototype
is an essential prerequisite of the acceptance
by the Railways of Australia and the larger
industrial clients, of any equipment which
includes significant departures from well-
established practices.
Manufacturing facilities in the Australian
plants have been adequately maintained
during the year, and, where appropriate, more
modern equipment has been introduced.
Since balance date, the Company has
extended its activities in the merchandising
of glass and glass products and automotive
spares and accessories by acquisition through,
the Grouse and Brown subsidiary of adai-
tional businesses at Annandale and Liverpool..
A new wholly owned subsidiary Aresco
Trak-Chief Pty. Limited—has been incor-
porated in South Australia, and on the
Ist July. 1968, it acquired the assets of two
businesses engaged in the design, manufacture,
and supply of a wide range of Railway Track
Maintenance Equipment.
In July, 1968, our Managing Director,
Mr. A. A. Trimble, during a visit to the
United States and Europe, initiated negotia-
tions aimed at introducing additional selling
agencies and manufacturing license agree-
ments into our Group. As a result of that
visit, the Company has recently entered into
a selling and manufacturing license agreement
with the Jeffrey Mining Machinery Company
of Ohio, U.S.A., covering the American Com-
pany’s range of coal mining and materials
handling equipment.
All of the above moves are obviously aimed
at broadening the base of the Company’s
operations and your Directors are confident
that they will achieve this end.
The forward outlook for ithe current year
in Australia indicates a slight increase in
Australian earnings subject, naturally, to the
effects of any unforeseen circumstances which
may arise during the remainder of the year.
In April, 1968, Comeng acquired the
remaining minority interest in Mining and
General Engineering Limited with the aim of
developing that subsidiary as part of a plan
to increase its profitability.
'Subsequentlly, and whilst these development
plans were being finalised, Comeng received,
quite unexpectedly, an approach from
Portec Pty. Ltd. for the sale to that Company
of the Mining and General activity. This
approach culminated in Portec making an
offer in September, 1968, for the whole of the
issued capital of Mining and General
Engineering Limited.
If Comeng were to proceed with its own
plans for the development of Mining and
General, it would be effectively investing the
attractive price offered by Portec, plus an
additional substantial amount implied in the
further development of the business, and
Comeng decided that the extremely com-
petitive conditions presently surrounding the
jobbing engineering industry in N.S.W. did not
warrant an investment of this magnitude in
that industry. Accordingly, the Portec offer
was accepted and the above transactions are
to be completed on or before 29th November,
1968.
EXPORT:
Commonwealth Engineering (Victoria) Pty.
Limited is currently executing an order for
the supply of a variety of railway freight
vehicles for Burma. These vehicles are being
supplied by Australia under the Colombo
Aid Plan.
SOUTH AFRICA:
Union Carriage & Wagon Co. (Pty.)
Limited again completed a very successful
year at its plant at Nigel in the Transvaal
State of the Republic of South Africa. As I
predicted in my address to you a year ago,
this subsidiary achieved a programmed rise
in turnover and profit for the year under
review, and deliveries to the South African
Railways included:
96 i'6oo h.p. Mainline Electric Locomotives
262 Passenger Coaches.
65 Tank Wagons.
2 Bullion Wagons.
Whilst the South African subsidiary has on
hand a very satisfactory workload of
unexecuted orders, its turnover and
profitability will be down slightly in the
1968/69 year as compared with the year just
completed. This fall will be due to a temporary
production gap occurring in the locomotive
production channel. As mentioned in the
Report of the Directors, orders already on
hand will keep this channel occupied until
well into 1970, but the latest orders which
caned for design changes and higher horse-
power rating were received too late to ensure
continuity of production in this channel.
The South African subsidiary is at present
not in need of any set program for diversi-
fying its activities and the forward outlook
for railway rolling stock in that country is
still very encouraging.
Orders received by Union during the 1967/68
year amounted to $A.27.4 million, and since
balance date further orders have been received
in the sum of $AjlB.4 million. It is planned
to have a complete exchange of information
between Australia and South Africa in the
diversification so that our companies
in both countries might receive the maximum
benefit of any moves which we may make in
this regard.
During the year the Australian organisation
.* as sisted the South African subsidiary
with extensive design information supplied
under its technical service agreement with
union.
As usual, the South African plant was
visited periodically during the year by our
Managing Director, Mr. A. A. Trimble and bv
other members of the Board, including
myself.
GENERAL:
I believe that stockholders may continue to
view with i con ffdence the Group’s prospects
for the future.
Diversification moves already undertaken
and others immediately in prospect, including
the establishment of a national Equipment
Marketing Organisation to handle the distri-
bution of the Group’s growing range of
engineering equipment, will, I believe open
up new avenues for selling agencies bn the
one hand and will provide an immediate and
growing source of work for our manufacturing
plants on the other, thus further adding to
the spread of investment, which as I have
mentioned earlier in this address, has con-
tributed to the Company’s record of earnings
since its incorporation.
No doubt ithe Board’s dividend policy of
recommending bonus dividends over and above
the basic rate of 10% whenever the results
of a particular year warrant such a recom-
mendation is by now well-known to stock-
holders, who will also be aware that a bonus
dividend has been recommended by the
Directors for each of the past five years
I am pleased to report that Group earnings
for the first three months of the current
year represent a slight improvement bv
comparison with the 1967/68 year, and that
subject to unforeseen circumstances the
results for the 1968/69 year should warrant
the payment of a bonus dividend.
DIRECTORS AND STAFF:
I wish to pay tribute to the endeavours of
my fellow Directors throughout the year, and
rn r,rl tha f 1 - k t-J 01 the wholehearted
Co '^i er ? tlon whlch they have extended to me
as Chairman.
On behalf of the Board, I would also wish
t° record our appreciation for the loyalty and
efficiency of the Management and Staff of
the Group throughout the period.
CONCLUSION:
Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen, it affords
me Pleasure to move that the Balance Sheet
the Company as at 30th June, 1968, the
p rofit and Loss Account for the year ended
on that date, and the Reports of the Directors
and Auditors thereon. be received and
approved and i invite some stockholder to
second the motion.
F. P. DONOHOE.

THE LAND
Preparations
lagging
on the Ord
The Bandicoot diversion dam on the
Ord River
THERE’S BAD NEWS from the Ord,
bad, that is, for the prospect of a
resounding success for cotton-growing
there. Only about half the cotton-
growers in the Kununurra area are
preparing ground for the new season’s
plantings, which have to be completed
within the next few weeks and at
latest by the start of the “wet” around
Christmas. Preparations for all except
stub cotton usually take about two
months. As a rule, growers start these
soon after the previous year’s harvest
is gathered in August, when the old
plants are removed and ploughing
commences. Reploughing follows and
the ground is built into ridges, drains
are prepared, and there’s a general
clean-up in time for the first weed-
control watering toward the end of
October. Soon after this, weeds are
ploughed in and more watering is done
as a prelude to the application of
superphosphate ahead of the December
plantings. After the wet begins, it is
virtually impossible for the growers to
get on to their land, and in any case
the seed should be in well before the
wet. So time would seem to have run
out for growers who haven’t started
their preparations yet.
The procedure can to some extent
be telescoped for stub cotton, mainly
because it doesn’t entail pre-growing
watering for weed control. But as has
been experienced on the Ord already,
stub cotton is a risky proposition, as
the absence of weed control is liable
to mean a dirty cotton at harvest. Its
use has long been banned in the United
States. Resort to it on the Ord stems,
it seems, mainly from disillusion about
prospects among the growers, who
feel that they can save money on
preparations needed for other plantings.
The danger is that, quite apart from
the marginal profitability of growing
cotton on the Ord, cotton from the
area could get a bad reputation.
Already Australian spinners have be-
come wary of it.
There is no shortage of seed cotton
at Kununurra holding growers back
from preparing for the new season, but
there is some question of sufficient
fertiliser being available on the Ord in
time for the coming plantings. It usually
takes about a month to get fertiliser on
the farms in the region after ordering
it from Perth. Farmers who have defi-
nitely decided to plant have attended
to their requirements of super., but
those sitting on the fence could be in
trouble in delaying decisions. Reports
from fertiliser firms in Perth indicate
that orders for superphosphate are well
below those of last year for delivery in
the high discount months of November
and December (the discounts are worth
$2 a ton for delivery this month and
$1 for December delivery). And an
SOS has gone out from W.A.’s Agri-
cultural Minister, Mr. Nalder, to alert
farmers of the position. Ord cotton-
growers certainly can’t afford to forgo
such concessions and still expect their
chorus for increased government assist-
ance to be heard sympathetically.
Lagging demand for superphosphate
on the Ord is symptomatic of disillu-
sionment in the region as expressed by
one of the biggest growers and one of
the scheme’s erstwhile strongest sup-
porters last week. In his view, “If the
Government has said the last word on
assistance and if no more comes, it
will mean the end for the present
growers. In the past few weeks I have
looked at the situation from all angles,
and I cannot see any hope of success
now. We thought the yields would
improve faster than they have and that
new varieties would come to the fore
quicker. Farmers cannot afford to lose
or to break even. We must make a
profit if we are to pay living expenses
and repay debts. Very big increases in
yields would help, but it is impossible
to hope that many growers will achieve
this, especially if they cut back
preparations.”
For all that, a lot of growers are
still working hard on their farms on
the Ord scheme and are well advanced
in their preparations for the new plant-
ings, turning the other cheek, as it
were, to the prospect of governmental
interest in them running down and
deeply conscious that other cotton-
growing areas in Australia are beating
them hands down in quality, costs, and
marketing and can contemplate the
phasing-out of the $4 million cotton
bounty in the next four years with
relative indifference. Unlike Ord
growers, those in other cotton-growing
areas are not virtually wholly dependent
on cotton for their livelihood. In the
past three years, 98 percent of Ord
growers’ total receipts came from the
staple, whereas in areas such as the
Murrumbidgee Irrigation and Rain-
grown (Queensland) cotton provided
less than half total farfn incomes.
What is more, Government assistance
is the key to profitability on the Ord,
whereas in other areas growers could
get along without it. Over the past
three years, for instance, net growers’
income per farm without the cotton
bounty was as much as $28,427 in the
Namoi area, ranging down to $5404 on
the MIA and $4540 in the Raingrown
area, whereas without the bounty Ord
growers would have shown a loss aver-
aging $6300 per farm (inclusive of the
bounty, gross farm income on the Ord
averaged $19,938 over the period com-
pared, say, with $69,767 for Namoi).
So it is no wonder that, confronted by
reducing bounty payments and in the
absence of proposals for giving them
alternative forms of assistance, Ord
growers feel they’ve been pushed to the
crossroads, facing a fate hardly
deserved by the pioneers of a part of
Australia where pioneering was so
sorely needed.
AGRISEARCH
CHEMICAL SHEARING
A FEW WEEKS AGO a brief note
appeared in the newspapers, saying that
a method of chemical shearing had
been discovered in America. An Aus-
tralian sheep scientist when asked to
comment poured cold water on the
idea. He explained that in the past
chemicals had been found which caused
sheep to shed their wool, but there were
several disadvantages, and the method
did not promise to replace machine
shearing as a practical substitute.
These chemicals usually caused the

wool to loosen unevenly so that some
.fell off in the paddock before the main
{portion of the fleece was ready to be
plucked. Moreover, the plucking took
about as long as it takes a competent
shearer to shear a sheep. Further infor-
mation has now been obtained from the
United States Department of Agri-
culture which suggests that this latest
attempt may well warrant further
serious consideration. It promises at
least to cut shearing costs, which are
no small item in the overall cost of
wool production.
Medical scientists at the National
Cancer Institute in America in the
course of testing drugs meant to stop
the riotous cell growth that goes on in
a malignant tumour noted that one
group of these chemicals also caused
the cells in hair roots to stop growing.
They tipped off the Department of
Agriculture, which then conducted
tests specifically on sheep. In a series of
trials it was found that these particular
drugs were far superior to any that
had been tried before. The new drugs
have a wide safety margin. Doses far in
excess of the quantity needed to cause
a satisfactory break in the wool do not
seem to produce any undesirable side
effects. Secondly, the break occurs
uniformly, but not so completely that
the fleece falls off of its own accord.
Processing tests have still to be carried
out on the wool itself to check that the
fibre is not harmed in any way.
Another possibility still to be checked
out is that the sheep do not develop
a tolerance to the drugs after repeated
annual doses, though this is highly
unlikely, and whether any harmful
chemical residues are deposited in the
meat. Even if this does occur it is
improbable that the residues would
persist so long that the health authori-
ties would not pass the meat as fit for
human consumption if slaughter was
delayed for a certain period after
shearing. An unknown hazard is the
effect on pregnant ewes. If adverse this
could be a serious limitation.
The new drugs may be given by
mouth or injection. Seven days later
the weakened root cells are extruded to
the level of the skin surface. The
fleece can then be cleanly removed by
plucking out a handful to open it up
and pushing the rest off with a rolling
action of the wrist. Provided the wool
is removed systematically it hangs
together as a complete, ordinary fleece
ready to be picked up and flung out
on the skirting table. There is no
problem with “second cuts” and the
sheep themselves, of course, suffer no
cuts or bruises and seem less inclined
to object to losing their wool by this
means than by the clippers. But they
are skin bare, which could be a disad-
vantage under a fiercely sunny Aus-
tralian sky or when the weather turned
very cold immediately after shearing.
However, it seems that with at least
some breeds of sheep and with low
doses of the drug, shearing can be post-
poned well beyond the seventh day
and thus allow enough time for the
new wool to grow out to a protective
length while the old fleece still clings
on firmly until pulled or pushed off
in the shearing shed. This chemical-
induced shedding process may not be
as unnatural as it at first seems, because
sheep are among the relatively few
species that do not shed their coats
after winter. The physiological response
of the sheep to the drug could be the
same as that occurring spontaneously
in the majority of species.
The main immediate attraction of
chemical shearing to the Americans
and, presumably, to us also, is that it
enables less-skilled and hence less-costly
labor to be employed. Another import-
ant point is that skilled shearers are
becoming scarce, and lads willing to
step out on the boards and learn are
fewer each year. But most important of
all, chemical shearing opens the way
to further or even complete mechanisa-
tion of the whole laborious business of
defleecing a sheep. One can imagine
some sort of satisfactory system now
being devised whereby the sheep are
run from a race in groups of a dozen
or more on to a raised annular plat-
form, to be seized at the tug of a lever
by a few deftly placed restraining bars.
Men standing on either side of each
sheep could then whisk the wool off
them. To complete the mechanisation,
a gadget rather like a chicken plucker,
consisting of brushes with rubber
bristles, might be applied at this point.
It will soon be 100 years since the
present technique of shearing was
evolved in Australia. It has been virtu-
ally unchanged ever since. No one in
this country at the moment is conduct-
ing any research aimed at up-dating
shearing. This is unpardonable at a
time when costs of production are
crippling the wool industry, and graziers,
like their own sheepdogs chasing their
tails, are stocking more and more
heavily in an effort to make increased
quantities of a surplus product meet
costs. We have been warned that much
of the country is already overgrazed
and in serious danger of being reduced
to desert.
WE SHOULD correct an unfortunate
typographical error that has been dis-
covered in the last paragraph of the
article on eggs, The Bulletin, Nov. 9.
The word “protein” was substituted for
“pectin.” The sentence should have
read: “The only known way of counter-
acting this rise in the amount of
heart-damaging cholesterol circulating
in the blood is by the consumption of
pectin, which seems to work by hasten-
ing the passage of the food through the
bowel.” Having reverted to this state-
ment it now occurs to us that perhaps
we should have mentioned for the
edification of the idle and sedentary
that physical exercise also reduces the
cholesterol content of the blood. How-
ever, the man-on-the-land probably has
no need of this information. Generally,
he is inclined to engage in too much
activity and not enough thoughtful
settin’.


CHARTISTS HOPES
THE CHARTIST suggests that
investors, particularly those who bought
near “top” areas in recent months, will
have a chance to recoup some losses
during the coming weeks, as the trend
appears to be turning to an upward
direction.
INVESTMENT
The Markets
THE ESTABLISHMENT
GIVES NOTICE
TO CURIOUS RAIDERS
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
ABOUT THE ONLY THING that
Mauri Bros, and Thomson Ltd. and
Burns Philp and Co. Ltd. have in
common is image. Both are old-
established; both are conservative; both
have inward-looking policies; and both
command healthy investment respect on
the sharemarket. A merger between
the two on these grounds was probably
unthinkable to both parties, although it
must be'said that both have pursued
expansionary and diverse courses in
recent years.
Yet the two senior members of the
Sydney “establishment” have gone as
close to merging as can be arranged.
Burns Philp has been allotted an 18
percent interest in Mauri Bros., while
Mauri has been allotted an 8.4 percent
interest in Burns Philp. Burns Philp, it
must be said, has a record of taking
substantial percentages of “outside”
companies, and the move of itself may-
well be identified as an extension of the
island trader’s extensive investment
portfolio. At that, for the price paid
(50 cents a share compared with a
market of $1.90), Burns Philp imme-
diately obtains a paper profit of $1.40
a share, or, if you like, $7,000,000 on
the 5,000,000 Mauri shares it obtains.
Mauri, equally, obtains Burns Philp
shares at $1.25 a share compared with
a market price (ex-bonus, for the Burns
Philp shares allotted to Mauri do not
rank for Burns’ bonus handout of one-
for-five in January) of $5 a share and
obtains a paper profit immediately of
$3.75 a share $7,500,000 on the
2,000,000 shares it gets.
So, the crosslinking of ownership
brightens up considerably the inner
strength of both companies. It does not
generate any new cash. Mauri gives
Burns Philp a cheque for $2,500,000.
Burns Philp gives Mauri a cheque for
$2,500,000.
The deal, however, places Mauri
Bros, outside the realm of 100 percent
takeover. With broad shareholdings
quite substantial, in fact, it places Mauri
well outside the scope of a takeover for
control. Equally, Burns Philp board—
already strongly fortressed by cross-
linking shareholdings from its insurance
associates (Queensland, Bankers and
Traders, and Equitable)—is placed fur-
ther away from any curious raider
intent on picking up what is the largest
portfolio of investments outside the
assurance industry.
Of course, shareholders’ equity in
both companies is watered by the place-
ment of shares below the intrinsic book
value (and well below real values).
Burns Philp partially corrects this by
giving existing shareholders yet another
bonus issue (one-for-five). Mauri, too,
has just made a one-for-four bonus to
maintain the pattern established since
1952 of making a one-for-four bonus
every four years. It remains that the
price of an alliance for defensive pur-
poses is still a pretty dear one as far
as other shareholders are concerned.
In making the deal, however, the two
boards suggest that there is to be close
co-operation wherever possible through-
out the two spheres of operations. Possi-
bilities of close co-operation do not
appear large to the outsider. The area
of island produce as raw material base
for Mauri’s operation is one, although
here it is difficult to imagine that there
is any great prospect of Mauri gaining
much benefit at the expense of the
island plantation group’s figures.
Burns Philp’s renewal of its push into
Australian retailing in recent years
(having swopped its Penneys chain 12
years ago for a large holding in
G. J. Coles), added to its domination of
retailing in Papua and New Guinea,
offers considerable outlets for Mauri’s
consumer food products. Close
co-operation between manufacturer and
retailer is essential in these days of
national buying by massive food chains.
Commercial protectionist policies
need to be examined for their real
benefit to shareholders. This is funda-
mental to the current generation of
joint stock companies in Australia; the
family monarchy is growing less and
less among our companies and is being
replaced by executive republics. This is
not a bad thing in today’s mass owner-
ship capitalism. However, it does bring
with it the loss of complete control
by the executives which was available
in the early days on centralised owner-
ship.
That bi-party arrangements can be
brought into play to bolster the
executive may prove not to be in the
best interests of the owners in the long
run. This does not necessarily apply to
Mauri Bros.-Burns Philp.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: Sweeter times could be coming for investors
holding FAIRYMEAD SUGAR. Prices have recently moved up to $l.BO on high
volume, which is a breakout from a consolidation pattern of several years’ duration.
In the short-term there could he some reaction back to about the $1.50 level, but
the medium-term objective is approximately $2.50, with the potential of a longer-
term move to approximately $3.80, where it would encounter resistance selling
from the 1963/64 “top” situation. Technically, it could he regarded as a good
trendline study, but the past history on the chart shows a rather unprofitable one
for long-term holders. Last sale price on 14/11/68 —$1.80.
PORTFOLIO, DEVELOPMENT
SIR IAN'S VIGOR
SIR lAN POTTER’S puff for Portfolio
and Development at the meeting last
week added substance to the firm
market in the shares this year, when
they’ve come up from a low of $l.lO
to $1.45 without any noticeable change
in the sedate profit performance in
recent years. Admittedly, the substan-
tially heavier tax provision for the
latest year suggested that some revival
in earnings was taking place following
two years of diminishing cover for the

1963) and then AUC (1967), the two
main original shareholders, bowed out
of the affair, Sir lan and his fellow
shareholders (including Mr. E. R.
Griffin, of Boral, which had acquired
AGC’s stake in the company) were con-
tent to let it slumber. However, now
refreshed since his retirement from
stockbroking last year, Sir lan Potter
is going to wake it up and in prepara-
tion has been looking at all the possi-
bilities outlined in the original pros-
pectus to discover the best way to
launch it into more vigorous activity.
These include underwriting and sub-
underwriting, acquisition of interests in
companies, participation in industrial
development propositions, and the pro-
vision of financial facilities in general—
all very much Potter country. Under
Sir lan’s guiding light some fireworks
could be coming up.
This is all very intriguing. But what
Sir lan had to say about the current
general climate in the share and money
markets was, perhaps, more interesting.
He thought the significant thing about
the current market was that, in spite
of the recession of about one-third in
value of leading mining securities, they
were still “appreciably” higher than a
year earlier. “At this stage of the
cycle, this would appear to be evidence
of sellers’ resistance, so, on the whole,
prospects for capital recovery in the
better-grade securities are considerably
better than they were a few months
ago,” he said. “On the other hand, the
money market seems to be approaching
a testing period in which major con-
version operations in Commonwealth
securities may be coupled with unsatis-
fied demands of industry to finance
urgently needed capital expenditure. It
is important for the economy that the
financial needs for both the public and
private sectors should be met, and this
will call for a maximum of co-operation
and dexterity on the part of both the
Government and the financial system at
large.”
WESTRALIAN
CAUTIOUS COMFORT
WESTRALIAN shareholders who saw
their shares climb to $1.45 in the
halcyon mining boom days earlier this
year, and now find them back to 88
cents, can take a little comfort from
the recent step-up in production of the
company’s main product, ilmenite, to
an annual rate of 90,000 tons, and the
chairman’s prediction that by January
it will be up to 100,000 tons. Last year
to June 30, output of this mineral
dropped slightly to 74,809 tons. This
was mainly because premium-grade
ilmenite in certain, of the company’s
areas was confined to ground with
below-average mineral content and this
involved changing the routine, which,
in turn, also cut back output of zircon
(from 13,583 to 12,861 tons) and of
monazite (from 941 to 495 tons). To
make matters worse, the main contract
for ilmenite was in sterling, and when
that currency was devalued in Novem-
ber last the Australian currency
receipts from it dropped. The contract
was renegotiated in Australian currency
terms with effect from January, but
this was at a reduced price, and only
partly compensated for the loss from
devaluation.
A revaluation of stocks at a lower
figure was necessary and also cut into
profits. Further, the zircon market
weakened (as a result of substitution
by chro.me in foundry uses) and,
although the forward position of mona-
zite sales is secure, there are depress-
ing forecasts around for 'that mineral,
also. Against this, the ilmenite position
suggests sales will be increased at exist-
ing prices. So, this bulking largest in
the companys income calculations,
there could be an improvement in over-
all income in the current year (last
year, total income dropped from
$2,029,390 to $1,864,949 and only a
three percent final dividend was paid
for the year as against an interim of
two percent tax-free, and a final of
two percent in the previous year).
The company is expected to get some
economies fro,m storing and shipping
a greater percentage of its output in
bulk. Long-term feasibility studies are
in progress, too, for upgrading ilmenite;
these could bring benefits to the com-
pany, whose officers seem wide awake
to the world play in the three minerals.
FRIGRITE
LESS-TROUBLED AIR
THE SAGA OF air-conditioning in
Australia is threaded with some of
the saddest company mishaps of recent
times. Frigrite’s falling from grace five
years ago is one of them. The ques-
tion, now the group has pulled out of
the spin, is how happy the sequel is
to be. One good augury is that on his
retirement from the long, hard task
of getting General Credits out of the
awful mess it was in when he took
over the general manager’s job seven
years ago, Mr. D. G. McOmish has
joined the Frigrite board. Another is
that, after one of the best years since
the 1954 float (the business itself was
started in Melbourne 38 years ago),
the accumulated losses from the two
black years (1963 and 1964) have
nearly been made good (at June 30
last there was only $68,977 to go).
Maybe a bonanza is not yet in
sight, but shareholders’ hopes of at
long last getting a return on their
investment were raised by the chair-
man last week. After four years with-
out a payment (the last was five per-
cent for 1962-63, which was preceded
by a series of 10 percenters), he said

a resumption of payments was likely
during the current year which he ex-
pected would be a better one than the
previous term. In the latter, profit came
out at $341,000, lifting earning rate
from 10.3 to 15.5, that is, if one ignores
a note to the accounts telling of a
change in the latest year in the method
of assessing profits. Previously, profits
were only taken into the accounts for
the year on contracts, completed in that
year, whereas last time they were
taken in -on a progressive basis during
the course of contracts. How much this
influenced the latest result is not stated,
but it would have meant an increase of
$20,000 if applied to the previous year’s
profits, the report says.
The chairman appears to be on safe
ground in predicting an improvement
in profitability this year. Apart from
having a lot of smaller hardware to sell
(the company has several important
licensing agreements with leading U.S.
companies in its field), Frigrite is one
of the leaders here in air-conditioning
for big commercial buildings, and there’s
no sign of the boom in them subsiding.
Furthermore, the group has been active
in scrubbing subsidiaries and generally
tightening up its management struc-
ture. It had about 40 subsidiaries at
one time, quite a few of them being
legacies from its active takeover period
in the 1959-62 period, in which the
capital was greatly boosted by share
exchanges to the ultimate detriment of
shareholders (ordinary capital is now
$2,214,000 in $1 units). It will be
recalled that most of the big earlier
losses were incurred by one subsidiary.
These losses were $578,466 in 1962-63
and $202,716 in the following year.
One swallow doesn’t make a summer,
of course, and this seems to have been
in the market’s mind last week in view-
ing the prospect of an early resumption
of dividends. The shares came up with
the rest of the market earlier in the
year and touched 90 cents after being
as low as 40 at one time. Last week
they were only attracting mild support
up to 82 cents.

balance sheets
GENUINE, FRUITFUL
DIVERSIFICATION
BUILDS CRESTKNIT
THE MULTIPLICATION of 1964
profits 3.3 times gives some idea of the
rapid growth of Melbourne knitwear-
and garment-maker Crestknit Industries
Ltd. But recent results are no flash
in the pan (1961 profit has been multi-
plied 7.7 times) and is the outcome of
genuine expansion and fruitful diversifi-
cation.
The secret of its success in the past
five years, particularly, is diversification
within the clothing trade. Initially con-
cerned with woollen knitwear, Crest-
knit’s coverage now of synthetics and
summer goods for all the family has
given the company a steady round-the-
year trade. Although this obvious scope
for sales growth and spread of over-
heads has now been fulfilled, the
ebullient chairman (Mr. A. J. Brady),
who has 51 years’ experience in the
textile and garment trades, sees plenty
of growth ahead. A recent fillip was
to move into children’s playwear, and
he considers the company can further
penetrate women’s knitwear in the next
couple of years. In fact, Crestknit is
currently negotiating to buy a small
company specialising in women’s knit-
wear.
Last year’s 16 percent profit advance
to a record profit level (from record
sales) was made in what was a difficult
trading year for the industry. Crestknit
has also had a very good opening four
months for 1968-69, with sales 19
percent higher than the comparable
period last year. The past few years’
sales growth has been assisted by the
remarkable technological developments
in knitting machines and equipment. By
contrast with weaving, knitting tech-
niques have improved very consider-
ably. But Mr. Brady thinks knitting
developments will be never-ending.
Senior management is constantly going
overseas to visit machine-producing
areas to check on the latest advances.
This growing sophistication has been
a bonus for established firms like Crest-
knit. Producers of low-grade merchan-
dise have been eliminated, thus stabilis-
ing the industry, because the new
machinery is costly and requires tech-
nical ability to maintain production.
On the other hand, in the past year or
so, there has been more stability in
retailing, after the wash-up of Reid
Murray, Cox Bros., and Marcus Clark
failures, to the benefit of manufacturers
supplying the retail trade.
Crestknit has about 4000 retail
customers. Mr. Brady believes the big
department stores will continue their
aggrandisement, while the smaller ones
remaining will be specialists stocking
quality merchandise. Although official
statistics of retail sales of clothing and
drapery do not reflect much growth in
recent years, Mr. Brady considers the
potential market for clothing is great.
Fashion begins with young people, he
says. And the “younging” of the popu-
lation should increase demand for
fashion. He is careful not to oversupply
the market, a trap into which other
.manufacturers fall, and prefers to
diversify. The creation of a brand
image by advertising means there is
consumer demand behind the retailer.
Mr. Brady’s philosophy is to make a
good article, sell it through an efficient
organisation, and let the customer know
it is available.
The business emanated from Mr.

Brady’s experience in warehousing. In
1947, he formed a clothing distributing
company, J. A. Brady Pty. Ltd., and
by 1954, when the company was floated,
Crestknit moved into manufacturing.
Various acquisitions accelerated the
company’s growth the takeover of
Saxony Manufacturing Co. Pty. Ltd.
in 1964, which .makes and markets
knitted fabrics to the furniture and
clothing trades; the Sargood Gardiner
shirt factory; and the Geelong spinner
of lambswool and blended yarn, and
weaver of woollen fabrics, Redpath and
Son Pty. Ltd. Major operations are in
Hawthorn, Collingwood, and North-
cote, all Melbourne suburbs, with
smaller operations where female labor
is available at Surrey Hills, Epping,
Wonthaggi, and Bendigo in Victoria.
The oldest activity is the manufacture
of knitted outerwear garments by
Crestknit (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. at Haw-
thorn, with a branch factory at Ben-
digo. New plant was installed in 1967,
which is equally capable of knitting
wool or synthetic yarn. Saxony Manu-
facturing Co. Pty. Ltd. makes knitted
fabrics at Collingwood, and is an
approved producer of “Crimplene.”
The acquisition of Aywon Pty. Ltd.,
of Northcote, in 1962, gave Crestknit
the biggest production of women’s
quality slacks for summer and winter.
This popular brand has been extended
to men’s slacks and shorts. Aywon is a
licensed user of the American “Kora-
tton” permanent-press process.
The underwear division has added
summer pyjamas for men and boys to
its range, and Crestees, children’s
functional playwear made from knitted
fabrics. These are made under licence
to Pilgrim Sportswear of the U.S. and
this activity was integrated into the
underwear division at very little cost.
In the States, Pilgrim does a very big
business in garments for children from
18 months to six years; Crestknit thinks
this will be a most profitable activity.
The shirt division makes men’s Bri-
Nylon shirts, and women’s Bri-Nylon
and Orion summer knitwear, and
men’s cotton knit shirts, experiencing
substantial sales.
In New Zealand, Mosgiel Woollen
Factory Co. Ltd. makes Crestknit mer-
chandise. Exports accounted for
$200,000 of a total turnover believed
to approximate $l2 million last year.
Crestknit management believes that
the company’s money should go into
plant, merchandising, and financing
debtors. It does not have a big invest-
ment in buildings, less than $1 million,
compared with a net $l.l million in
plant (depreciated almost 50 percent
from cost), $2.7 million in stocks, and
$1.6 million in debtors. Nonetheless,
freeholds increased $lBO,OOO in 1968
(there was new building at Northcote
and Hawthorn), compared with gross
additions to plant of $313,000. The
company expects to continue this rate
of expenditure on new machinery, and

is eligible for tax relief as investment
allowance. Tax provisions, however,
always look generous in relation to
declared profits.,
Provision for doubtful debts has now
been built up to $lOO,OOO (six percent
of debtors) and management assumes
that it will remain untouched. There
are no apparent provisions against
stocks, but the company is believed to
be extremely careful in its inventory-
taking; short of a major miscalculation
of the fashion market—and Crestknit
lines are not “way out”—there does
not seem to be any cause for concern
here.
In the past financial year some relief
was given from competition from low-
wage countries like Taiwan and Hong
Kong by quantitative restrictions on
portion of knitwear imports. Actually,
Crestknit was not terribly affected by
these imports, but may have been if
the situation had been allowed to con-
tinue. The industry is preparing a case
for submission to the Tariff Board next
April for protection against unfair
competition.
The clothing trade is notoriously
vulnerable to unusual weather condi-
tions and the late winter in Sydney this
year did adversely affect Crestknit. But
Crestknits product range and univer-
sality protects it to a degree. Recent
profits, anyhow, do not show the impact
of unseasonal weather.
A par issue in April, 1964, and
premium issues in April, 1966, and
April, 1967, have provided funds for
growth. In 1963-64 the company also
raised $400,000 in debenture money
and $BO,OOO in redeemable preference
shares. The cash issues have been
sweetened by simultaneous bonuses in
April, 1966, and April, 1967, and extra
bonuses in October, 1967, and April,
1968. April and October are usually the
eventful months for shareholders, but
three bonuses within slightly more than
a year preclude the possibility of
another early watering of capital.
Current ratio of a steady 1.4 to 1 does
not suggest any urgency for a cash issue,
either. The frequent bonuses and cash
issues are part of management’s policy
of looking after the shareholders. Divi-
dends have similarly been increased
from 11 percent in 1964 to 15 percent
in the latest year, a 2\ percent incre-
ment from 1967. The company can
comfortably maintain this 15 percent
dividend, but will probably want to
“get more under its belt” before another
capital gesture is made to shareholders.
A 3.8 percent dividend yield and 8.4
percent earnings yield from current
price of $2 for the 50c shares seem to
anticipate all reasonable income and
capital benefits for the time being. It
should be at least another 12 months,
if past traditions are observed, before
another issue, free or otherwise. But
a fine profit performance in a tricky
industry certainly deserves a higher
rating than was awarded formerly.

SOUTH'S COBAR MINE
IS STILL THE
MAIN PROFIT SPINNER
FOR ALL THE PROMISE that they
hold for the future, Broken Hill South’s
enormous deposits of phosphate are
unlikely to be of much commercial use
to the company for many years ahead.
As things stand at present, Australia
seems committed to using up the
deposits on Christmas Island, Ocean
Island, and Nauru before it turns to
its own deposits. This may well turn
out to be rather further ahead in time
than is hoped, as, at current rates of
extraction, these sources of supply will
not begin to run down for perhaps
ten years. By that time our consump-
tion of the mineral will probably have
grown sufficiently to provide a better
market than the four million tons which
is imported at present. Growth in
de'mand for fertilisers from Asian
countries, too, will by then no doubt
provide a market of sufficient size to
allow the exploitation of Broken Hill
South’s reserves. But to be viable any
development of the phosphate will have
to be on a very large scale and, while
the project appears to be directed at
the growing Asian market, the Food
and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations has estimated Asian
consumption in 1970-71 at million
tons, which is probably rather less than
would be required for economic opera-
tion. Paradoxically, the location of the
deposits places them in a State (Queens-
land) which accounts for less than three
percent of Australia’s fertiliser con-
sumption.
What the phosphate deposits will do
for the company is to insure its con-
tinued life as a miner long after its
ore reserves at Broken Hill are depleted
(which will happen in the foreseeable
future), and after the relatively new
mines at Cobar are worked out,
although this will not happen for more
than 30 years.
It is in fact from the company’s


System / 360
success story:
it’s even better
than we promised.
Less than three years ago we
delivered the first SYSTEM /360, a
new concept in computers.
Today SYSTEM/360 will be found in
practically every business in
Australia*. From the model 65, the
largest in Australia, to the smallest
model 20, SYSTEM/360 is living up
to all the forecasts and
expectations claimed for it!
We said SYSTEM/360 would grow
as your needs grow.
It will.
We said it would get even better.
It has.
Better Speed and Performance
Performance has been boosted
even beyond the outstanding
problem-solving power we had
promised. We’ve cut cycle time
from microseconds to
nanoseconds.
Better Protection of Your
Programming Investment
New hardware devices make
conversion to SYSTEM/360 easy.
It’s possible for IBM customers to
convert without costly
re-programming. When you get
SYSTEM /360 it’s ready to go to
work.
Now Better for Smaller Businesses
Last June we announced a new
small size SYSTEM/360 with higher
performance cost ratio than
anything we’ve ever offered before.
We are not through improving
SYSTEM/360
The nice thing about this unusual
system is this:
When you need a new way to put
information in or take it out, we can
connect the new device you need
onto this System without changing
in any way how you solve your
problems. We can incorporate new
technological developments in the
System, as they come along. The
System is open-ended. It will grow
as your needs grow.
SYSTEM/360 is the computer with
a future.
We plan to keep it that way.

mines at Cobar that the most dramatic
changes in profits will come during the
next few years, and this can easily be
overshadowed by the sheer magnitude
of the north Queensland phosphate
reserves 1350 million tons proved to
date. Production of ore from the CSA
mine at Cobar has made steady pro-
gress since mining began in July, 1965,
with tonnages reaching 198,728 in 1966,
419,561 in 1967, and 462,812 this year.
During the four weeks to October 12,
60,000 tons of ore were hoisted, indi-
cating that capacity levels of output
are now being achieved. It was
originally intended to reach full
capacity rather earlier, but the dis-
covery of substantial zinc-bearing
copper orebodies between the two
main copper lodes meant that develop-
ment work was stepped up at the
expense of ore production, and the con-
centrating plant had to be modified to
allow production of zinc concentrates.
Profitability has grown steadily with
production increases from a loss in
1966 to profits of $959,000 in 1967 and
$1,978,000 in 1968. Now that capacity
levels of throughput have been reached,
there should be an even better profit
this year, with profits from Cobar con-
tinuing to exceed results from the com-
pany’s mine at Broken Hill. At the
current rate of 60,000 tons of ore per
four-weekly period, the improvement in
profit should be considerable. The mine
was developed on very modern lines,
and costs should fall significantly on
higher throughput. Total costs for min-
ing, milling, and development were in
the order of $ll per ton for the mine’s
first year, and these appear to have
fallen by . perhaps $5 per ton. The
Increase in production from 460,000
tons to over 720,000 tons annually
could well mean a further saving of
$1.50 to $2 per ton, and revenue should
increase by at least 50 percent while
metal prices hold steady (as is likely).
The combination of these two factors
Is likely to mean that this year’s profit
from Cobar could be almost double last
year’s figure.
After then, shareholders can look
forward to still further improvements
at the Cobar complex as mining pro-
ceeds to deeper levels. The grade of
ore improves with depth, and as the
method of mining is to work upward
from a given depth (at present 1200 ft.
in the copper-zinc orebody and 1800 ft.
in the copper orebody) there will be
Increases in the metal content of ore
produced as time goes on, although
this will be fairly delayed as it will take
the company several years to finish min-
ing the current stopes and move to
lower levels.
To the south of the main mine at
Cobar the “Great Cobar” the
company is also continuing with its
prospecting of the orebodies near the
old “Chesney” mine. Ore reserves have
already been proved at this mine and

no doubt further drilling will add to
these. When the main mine has been
established for some years, a second
shaft in the area is by no .means out
of the question. The Chesney orebody
could support an operation producing
some 200,000 tons to- 300,000 tons per
annum, lifting output from the Cobar
area to around one million tons of ore
per year.
MOUNT ISA
NEW FUNDS NEEDED?
ELECTION PROMISES being what
they are, it could take some time before
Mr. Nixon’s promise to remove the res-
trictions on U.S. foreign investment
crystallise into fact. The American
Smelting & Refining Company is no
doubt keeping a close eye on the
position following the steep lift in costs
experienced by its 54 percent owned
subsidiary, Australia’s Mount Isa Mines
Limited, in that company’s latest year,
together with the massive expenditure
on new developments anticipated by
Sir George Fisher a few days ago.
The build-up in costs last year was
considerable, operating expenses rising
from $54.7 million to $80.9 million
after a slight decline (from 3.7 million
to 3.6 million tons) in ore treated. The
main increases in costs came from
higher wages and other benefits to
employees, and higher freight and refin-
ing costs. Rail freight rose by slightly
less than $1 million.
In recent years, capital expenditure
by Mount Isa has been tapering off
as the K 57 shaft and ancillary
facilities were completed, and last year
capital expenditure fell from $11.6
million to $6.9 million. At the annual
meeting last week Sir George Fisher
outlined some details of a further
new shaft to be sunk on the southern
orebody, about 7000 feet south of the
K 57 shaft. This new shaft is expected
to cost some s4| million and ancillary
ventilation shafts would probably add
a further $2 million to the cost of
developing this new production facility.
At the same time, Sir George
announced that the company would
construct a plant to produce zinc oxide
following investigations into the feasi-
bility of processing the company’s zinc
concentrate production. Exploration on
the company’s northern leases, 13 miles
from the existing mine, has also stepped
up and several promising intersections
of economic grade have been encoun-
tered.
Over the past three years, the
amount of cash generated from mining
operations has fallen considerably,
from some $22 million in 1966 to
million in 1968. There does not appear
to be any relief in sight from the
higher levels of costs, and the company
must be considering methods of raising
the funds needed for the new develop-
ments as well as for its normal require-


This unique
little iron-nickel pellet
is the modest
makings of a steelmaking
breakthrough
To make steel you've got to pop
iron and lime and silicon and
manganese and so on in the pot.
Then heat. Mix. Pour.
And for alloy and stainless steels,
very special steels, and extra-
special steels, you often need to
leaven with nickel.
General practice is'to add nickel
to the melt in primary forms,
such as electro and ferro. It's
also added as nickel-containing
scrap metal.
Kind of a complicated process
when you think about it. The
sort of problem steelmakers have
given a lot of thought to.
And Falconbridge researchers
also did some heavy thinking about
it. For years.
Result: An easy-to-store, easy-
to-handle precision product
that in one iron-nickel pellet* gives
the steelmaker a premium-
grade base charge for his furnaces.
This unique, reduced iron-
nickel pellet contains not only a
significant amount of nickel
but also a top percentage of iron.
Both percentages guaranteed.
Because of the enthusiasm of
steelmakers who have run
tests with these unique iron-
nickel pellets from
Falconbridge, a massive
plant now is under construction to
spew them out by the zillion.
The giant new plant—on stream
next year—will be the world's
only source of these mighty useful,
teeny-weeny iron-nickel pellets,
unique Falconbridge-made pellets
that overnight have handed
steelmakers a breakthrough to more
economic and effective
steelmaking.

rises in metal prices, shareholders can
hardly look forward to any increase
in the 10 cents per share dividend; and
the company’s new expansion plans
certainly seem to defer any hopes for
the long-awaited bonus issue which it

LAN RAY'S ARRIVAL
AT CLASSIC
CONGLOMERATE STATUS
TO EVERYTHING there is a season,
and the ’sixties is the season of the
conglomerate, another product of
United States business imagination. The
U.S. now has about fifty conglomerate
companies which grew from virtually
nothing to industrial giants within the
past eight years, including such notable
high fliers as Ling-Temco-Vought and
Gulf & Western. The concept is only
just arriving in Australia and investors
haven’t yet managed to assess the new
breed and its basic business philosophy.
Briefly, the conglomerate men believe
in growth through extensive diversifica-
tion, even into completely unrelated
activities, provided management knows
each activity fully and has the necessary
skills for tight control over all opera-
tions. Skill plus adaptability are the
outstanding features of successful con-
glomerates, with no room for hidebound
amateur businessmen.
Most Australian investors have heard
of Slater Walker, the U.K. conglom-
erate that has shown spectacular growth
and is heading for even bigger profits.
Slater Walker’s Australian offshoot
currently has a price/earnings ratio of
over 20, based on the company’s
estimated earnings for the year ending
December 31, 1968. On the other
hand, few investors seem to know about
Lanray Industries, a company which
has increased net asset backing per
share from $1 to $3 in just over nine
months and is on the way to becoming
a one-man conglomerate. Lanray’s
operations cover building materials and
hardware marketing, property invest-
ment, and a 50 percent interest in a
New Caledonian tourist hotel. Up to
1958, Lanray was a sick company and
went into receivership in 1956/57.
Substantial reorganisation and new
directors in 1958 have allowed the com-
pany to develop rapidly under the firm
guidance of its new chairman and
managing director, 45 - year - old

solicitor turned entrepreneur, and plans

Mclnnes became a full-time business-
man four years ago, after concluding
that his ideas and advice to clients
might as well be used for his own
advantage. In addition, there was the
legal man’s desire to show he can
handle himself in the rough and tumble
of the marketplace, aided in this case
by an accountancy qualification and a
willingness to tackle any likely profit-
able operation.
'Lanray’s activities in hardware and
building materials (through the Pen-
prase group) account for 79.8 percent
of net profit while employing only 58.2
percent of shareholders’ funds. Before
deducting $30,000 for parent company
expenses and overheads, the hardware
division came up with a net profit, after
tax, of about $166,000 in 1967-68, or
15.3 percent on shareholders’ funds
employed. As the latest returns on the
same basis for Nock & Kirby and
McEwans are 3.6 percent (1966/67)
and 7.6 percent (1967/68) respectively,
Lanray has an outstanding performance
in a highly competitive industry. Lan-
ray has sought out products not
handled by competitors and has sole
agencies. The range includes special
ceramic tiles, laminated door finishes,
door closers, and hand-dryers. I under-
stand tiles are a large part of the busi-
ness and growing rapidly in the current
building boom.
In New Caledonia, Lanray has a
50 percent interest in Hotel Le Nou-
vata, situated at Anse Vata beach,
Noumea. L. F. Mclnnes was quick to
see New Caledonia’s tourist potential,
and about five years ago became the
first foreign investor on the island. An
existing 36-room hotel was extended
with a modern building of 50 rooms,
restaurant, bar, and other facilities on
five acres of land. The hotel earned
$15,000 last year, and expects the
figure to be about $40,000 this year.
Despite difficulties in establishing a
business in New Caledonia, the hotel
has now got off the ground, but at
this stage is regarded primarily as an
investment in real estate. Property
values in Noumea are soaring and in-
vestment is helped by no income tax
and high depreciation rates. The joint
company wrote off $64,000 in depreci-
ation to the year ending December 31,
1967, of which $44,000 was in build-
ings, indicating healthy capital profits
if the property is sold. Hotel Le
Nouvata is expected to become a highly
profitable operation as Pacific tourism
leaps ahead with the advent of jumbo
jets in the 19705.
Lanray’s best potential lies in
property investment, and it is here that
the company is showing classic con-
glomerate methods. During 1968, Lan-
ray has hit the big-time in property
development and investment, leaving
the company in complete control of
Sydney’s 1.2-acre Royal Arcade/Adams

moves. The saga commenced in Febru-
ary when a part interest was acquired
in the Royal Arcade freehold, followed
in July by a joint venture with Stocks
and Holdings for the Adams Hotel site.
Lanray bought sole control of the Royal
Arcade and the balance of its other
investment property, Northgate House,
in August. Northgate House was then
sold to the State Superannuation
Board on a lease-back basis for 25
years, the proceeds being used to pay
off outside interests in the Royal Arcade
and other commitments. Finally, after
a breakdown in negotiations on re-
development, Lanray bought Stocks
and Holdings’ share of the Adams
Hotel for $500,000, and immediately
acquired an investment well in excess
of the interest purchased, as the two
properties, together, have a greater
development value than they had
separately. The net effect of these deals
will rocket Lanray’s net tangible assets
per share and provide better income
from Northgate House than the com-
pany was receiving with a 51 percent
equity interest.
A $22 million redevelopment scheme
of 45 levels is planned above Pitt St.
for the Royal Arcade/Adams Hotel,
incorporating a 600-room international-
class hotel, 190,000 square feet of office
space, shops covering 80,000 square
feet, and several levels of underground
parking. Financing has not yet been
finalised, but I understand it will be
intricate and provide Lanray with at
least a 50 percent equity interest.
The current year will be a continu-
ation of Lanray’s rapid profit growth,
and the company is set to take off as
its major projects come on stream.
Future plans are expected to double
net profit in five years, lift return of
net profit to present shareholders’ funds
by 250 percent in the same period, and
increase earnings per share to 40 per-
cent on ultimate capital. The company
expects to increase itd property interests,
but will also be looking at other
feasible activities. As Lanray grows,
L. F. Mclnnes plans to broaden man-
agement’s base, thus making the
company less reliant on his abilities.

Script editor James Davern...the
strain on all involved is fairly severe
EVEN IN its heyday Majella was
never one of St. Kilda Road’s more
gracious mansions. The facade is
sombre, the entrance hall ugly, and the
rooms dank and ill-proportioned. Now
it is home —or rather filing-cabinet
to the ABC’s Creative Personnel, TV,
for the use of.
A more jumbled, melancholy environ-
ment for writers and producers would
be hard to imagine, and one gets the
distinct feeling that the whole moulder-
ing warren would subside into Whel-
anesque rubble if it weren’t for the
constraints of ABC red tape. Cer-
tainly many of the ABC’s people in
Melbourne —and even more of those
who have left—see Majella as being
the architectural expression of their low
status and morale. For there are
generally far fewer creative oppor-
tunities in Melbourne than in Sydney,
where the big budgets are in bond for
“Contrabandits.”
This is why “Bellbird,” the ABC-TV
serial which is administratively head-
quartered at Majella, is such an impor-
tant project for local personnel, for
were the program to go off air Mel-
bourne would be left with a few
religious panel discussions and weather
reports plus odd jobs for “This Day
Tonight.” Fortunately, “Bellbird” is a
continuing success, and this despite its
unusual 15-minute length and leftover
time-slots. In fact, the program is
beloved by rural viewers, capturing
35 percent of the audience in Northern
Tasmania and Northern Victoria and
even higher figures in parts of Queens-
land.
“Bellbird’s” executive producer is
Pat Alexander, who struggled mightily
with “Australian Playhouse.” He must
get four episodes a week on air, each
a blend of location, filming, and video-
tape. With limited resources and a
weekly above-the-line budget of just
$4OOO, that takes some doing.
The key to success in series work
lies with the script editor, who must
direct and co-ordinate the work of
contributing writers. Script editors are
a rare breed in Australia, and the
“Bellbird” job is currently exhausting
the third incumbent, ex-drama pro-
ducer James Davern. At the moment
Davern has four writers in harness,
THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Writing for
the ‘Bellbird’
assembly line
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Ray Kollie, Oriel Grey, Don Battye,
and Judith Colquhon. Others are
waiting in the wings should any of the
team founder, but Davern has his
fingers crossed.
He and his writers meet each Mon-
day for a prolonged meeting in which
they talk out his broad synopsis. Once
agreement has been reached on plot
direction, a scene breakdown is handed
to each writer. “We’re limited to a
maximum of six sets per day,” says
Davern. “The writers must work
within a great many disciplines.”
Each writer handles a block of four
episodes and everyone works eight
weeks ahead to allow plenty of time
for set design and construction, casting,
and the planning of film sequences. A
week later a writer presents his or her
first draft, which Davern edits. Then
there’s a week for the final draft, fol-
lowed by a week’s rest for the writer.
Rates are high by Australian standards,
with each writer getting $5BO a month.
(Top writers on “Motel” get more than
$3OO a week, but their scripts are
double the length.)
The ABC uses what Ted Willis de-
scribes as the “deep end method of
training” for its writers, in that they’re
tossed into the pool and expected to
come up producing. A script editor’s
job is, therefore, to maintain an
assembly line tempo with often rela-
tively inexperienced writers, while
making allowances for, and to some
extent encouraging, creative freedom.
“There are four ingredients in com-
municating on television dialogue,
Filming “Bellbird” on location at
Gisborne, near Melbourne...four
episodes a week on a budget of $4000
silence, action, and reaction,” says
Davern. “Most of our writers find
dialogue and action the easiest. Silences
and reactions give them a lot of
trouble.” So from time to time, the
team watches other people’s programs
together and analyses them in terms of
script and structure.
As well, Davern must ensure that
there’s no obvious conflict of styles
between the four writers. “They’re all
different. Oriel’s probably the most
imaginative in pure terms, Judy’s the
best at really emotional writing. Ray’s
very good at humor.” And all their
approaches must blend. The writers do
not prepare an audio-video treatment,
but merely a dialogue script with brief
comments on the desired action. It is
left to the directors to convert these
drafts into shooting scripts.
Filming of lip-synch inserts takes
place mainly at a farm at Gisborne,
forty miles from Melbourne. Two days
a week are spent on location with a
crew comprising a director, unit man-
ager, lighting cameramen, operator, two
sound men, and a grip. The ABC used
to allow its team of studio directors to
handle their own film sequences, but
this was found to be too cumbersome.
Now all film is shot under the direction
of Ferdie Genes, who completes his
work three weeks ahead of the live
studio recording. Video-taping takes two
days a week, and the studio directors
(currently Don Sharpe, Julian Pringle,
and Keith Wilkes) each handle a block
of four episodes. The cast rehearse and
tape a scene at a time, and with just
12 hours of camera facilities, they’re
kept on their toes.
At the mo'ment, Pat Alexander has
ten actors under contract to “Bellbird”
with another 14 employed on a short-
term basis. The ABC won’t disclose the
fees paid, but Actors’ Equity seems
very happy with the terms and con-
ditions offered to their members. This
is in marked contrast to Equity’s
attitude to other program packages
with whom the union has a continuing
cold war.
The population of “Bellbird” has
undergone some fundamental changes
in recent times as various cast members

find their way back in future episodes,
adding other difficulties to the internal
logic of the scripts and the logistics of
production.
The strain on all involved in “Bell-
bird” is fairly severe, and Davern
wonders how long he’ll be able to keep
up with the tempo. Everyone con-
cerned claims great loyalty to “Bell-
bird” and deep involvement with its
characters. However, a love-hate rela-
tionship inevitably develops, and one of
the team sent me a note musing on a
possible end to the series:
“The N.S.W. and Victorian State
Governments will combine in a vast
irrigation scheme that will necessitate
flooding certain areas, one of which
will be the valley which contains
‘Bellbird.’ Through official negligence
or contrived villainy (that hasn’t been
decided yet) the information is with-
held from the citizens, and the whole
town (and the characters) sink under
the rising waters.
“Mr. Grossark is saved —because of
certain personal arrangements made
with God, he is able to walk on the
water. Mrs. Phillips is saved also.
They are married to each other on
water skis, speeding over the lake that
hides ‘Bellbird’ for ever. Mrs. Phillips
is attended by Henrietta, her
budgerigar, wearing a tiny pair of
water skis specially created by the prop
department. Naturally, you will treat
this advance information as extremely
confidential.” Naturally.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
ELEGANT SOUNDS
THE ROLE of prophet is a chancy
one at any time, and this fact was
amply borne out by the recital of the
Jean - Francois Paillard • Chamber
Orchestra at the Sydney Town Hall. I
thought the Paillard concert would
have been packed to the doors, yet,
although the hall was comfortably filled,
there was nothing like the roll-up I
expected. University exams and the
Higher School Certificate had appar-
ently cut into the concert-going time
of the strongest baroque fans in the
community.
Those who. were there heard music-
making from a group who sounded as
elegant as they looked. Everything was
beautifully tailored, ends of phrases
were rounded off with the same immac-
ulate precision that characterised their
inauguration, yet there was nothing
coldly mechanical about the playing.
From the opening notes of the concert
it was obvious that the acoustics of the
Town Hall coupled with the heavy
atmosphere was going to smudge the
sound, but even this hazard could not
temper the intrinsic freshness and
vitality which marked the playing
throughout.
The only disappointing sound of the
night was from the harpsichord; almost


inaudible when more than two other
instruments were playing, and so weak
in the cadenza of the Fifth Branden-
burg Concerto of Bach that all
immediacy was lost. What is one of the
most wonderful examples of culmina-
tion in music, a passage of musical
architecture which should be over-
whelming, was totally stripped of its
urgency and power. This was not the
fault of Miss Beckensteiner, who was
both nimble-fingered and imaginative
in her use of combinations, but of the
instrument, which is completely inade-
quate tonally for an auditorium of any
size.
The other soloists in the Bach were
Huguette Fernandez, violin, and Max-
ence Larrieu, flute, both of the calibre
one would expect of featured players
in one of the most famous ensembles
of its type in the world. Also, in a
concerto from the first half of the 18th
century, by Blavet, Mr. Larrieu dis-
played a beautifully wide, woody
French tone complemented by a mirac-
ulous dexterity and co-ordination. The
keynote of scholarly elegance was
epitomised by the conductor after whom
the orchestra is named. Obviously,
time-beating is superfluous with such a
group, so his sparing but definitive
gestures were confined to illuminating
phrasing, maintaining balance, and
pointing accents. Mr. Paillard’s contri-
bution, however, could not have
achieved these results without the
quality of the players; a quality refined
by sensitivity and tradition.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
DOUBLE EXPOSURE
The Swimmer. Director, Frank Perry.
The Secret Life of an American Wife.
Director, George Axelrod.
ONE OF THE LEAST obviously
likely candidates for screen treatment
would surely be John Cheever’s story
“The Swimmer.” Yet the seemingly
impossible comes off, to make an
unusual and strangely haunting film.
Burt
Lancaster
with Janet
Landgar din a
scene from
“The
Swimmer”
It may be objected by purists that the
more overt exposition of the screenplay
coarsens the texture of the original
story. Speaking for myself, I’ve always
found Cheever a sensitive and stimu-
lating writer, but so elliptical and enig-
matic as to be on occasion incompre-
hensible; and the screen - treatment is
tactfully understated only on a
couple of occasions does the adaptation
become too explicit and oversimplified.
Set in Connecticut’s millionaire belt,
the story starts at a poolside gathering
of hung-over neighbors regretting a
heavy Saturday night. One of them
suddenly announces his intention of
“swimming home” across country
through the series of luxurious pools
in the adjoining estates. His swim
becomes a journey back through his
own life, with illusions and pretensions
being stripped away one by one until
the charming, well-preserved socialite
is revealed in spiritual as well as
physical near-nakedness as an aging,
boastful failure.
Burt Lancaster, a much better actor
than most people realise, gives a subtle
and effective picture of the man’s
gradual deterioration; and there is a
remarkably distinguished supporting
cast. In particular, Janice Rule in her
short sequence manages with controlled
and icy bitterness to sum up: a whole
unhappy relationship with a selfish
lover. The photographic technique is
sometimes self-consciously lyrical but
often very beautiful, and it’s something
of a revelation for us poor ants to see
how a few gilded butterflies live. Not
that envy is the emotion one brings
away from the film the shallowness
of their lives, the spiteful back-biting
the desperate struggle to keep up have
been too clearly revealed.
“The Secret Life of an American
Wife” also makes its comments about
American living, though much less
deadly than those in “The Swimmer.”
It is far from a satisfactory piece of
movie-making, being patchy and
exceedingly slow to get moving; but
George Axelrod, who wrote, produced,
directed it, is a sharp-eyed and comical
fellow, and his three chief players are a
constant delight. Walter Matthau may
not be the standard idea of a sex-symbol
movie star, but he is such an expert
comedian that he ends up by making
you anyway, making me believe
it; Anne Jackson is thoroughly winning
as the suburban housewife rebelliously
determined to prove her continuing
sexual irresistibility. That underrated
actor Patrick O’Neal gives a droll and
convincing performance as the husband
whose preoccupation with clients and
business lunches is the cause of his
wife’s dissatisfaction. By the way, this
pair live in Connecticut, too, but in
a somewhat lower (though none the
less glossily prosperous) social bracket
than the characters in “The Swimmer.”
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
UNCONTROLLED COMEDY
The Old Bachelor. William Congreve.
Community Theatre, Sydney.
THIS IS Congreve’s shambling, loosely
articulated first play. Its plot elements
letters, revenges, masks, and cool
seductions are perfectly conventional,
but better plays of this type display-
some control over the on-stage impact
of one scene as opposed to another,
creating an effect of formal structure,
which is the chief delight of this sort
of comedy. “The Old Bachelor” never
manages this: the best scenes are not
crucial to the plot (but then what is?),
the characters seem an ill-assorted and
arbitrarily conceived bunch, and no
overall dramatic structure emerges.
The production (Alexander Arch-
dale) does not impose any artistic
control on the material. Surely it would
not have been difficult to make the
impromptu air of the plot into a
ro.mping virtue by using the songs
and dances in the script, moving the
static passages of bawdy dialogue
around a bit (I’m sure half the audi-
ence were not following some of the
sleaziest sexual imagery ever devised),
and by turning the unmasking cerem-
ony into an extended and interesting
finale. However, almost by accident, I
suspect, the production does achieve a
certain visual style and intellectual
emphasis; the excision of Captain Blunt
from the script makes the Bellmour
part of the plot a sort of centre, and
the disguising as a priest to seduce a
puritan’s wife is probably the most
striking scene. The constant movement
and sound of water in a central foun-
tain (a pity it had to be so ugly), so,me-
how associated itself rather well with
the perpetually renewed sexual impulse
that forms the mainspring of the plot.
Unlikely characters proved most in-
teresting Setter, the pimp (Sean
McEuan), Sir Joseph Wittol (Ted
Hodgeman), a part unfortunately some-
what reduced by the cutting of Blunt,
while Judith Conrow made Sylvia so
much the most pleasing of the ladies
that the injustice done her in the play
seemed doubly regrettable.

MELBOURNE poet P. Brian Cox
has set himself up as a “poetry con-
sultant.” He wiff read, criticise, and
offer market advice on poems for a set
scale of charges, ranging from $1 for
up to 24 lines, to $20 for 50 pages.
Possibly one would feel more enthusi-
astic if Mr. Cox’s own poetic achieve-
ments were more apparent in literary
magazines and anthologies. However,
perhaps there is an opening here for a
more recognisably successful poet. Per-
haps Judith Wright or A. D. Hope?
"HURRAH" FOR THE HOLE
PERTH’S Hole-in-the-Wall Theatre
will open a production of the play
“America Hurrah” on December 3 for
a three-week season . . . but on a
Members Only basis, although theatre
director Frank Baden-Powell points
out: “It’s nothing to do with me what
our members do with their tickets.”
Perth’s CIB has examined the script
and has Taken Exception to the act
called “Motel,” where actors, dressed
as dolls, scrawl four-letter words and
phallic symbols on a backdrop. Inspec-
tor H. W. Neilson says that if there are
any complaints about the play, detec-
tives will Investigate and Take Appro-
priate Action. Frank Baden-Powell’s
answer to any police interference would
be to substitute the words “bigotry”
and “censorship” for the rude ones.
IN TUNE WITH A MAJORITY
AT THE END of his 18 months as
creative arts fellow at the Australian
National University, George Dreyfus
has said farewell to the academy with
a concert which, if not exactly retro-
spective, gave a good idea of the range
and scope of his work over the past
few years. Dreyfus’ aims stem largely
from the fact that he is a full-time
composer — the only one in Australia
— and proud of it. Making a living
from film music and TV commercials
has brought him up harder than most
other composers against the problem
of what audience he wants to write for
and how he is to communicate with
them, and his views on music reflect
this background.
As Dreyfus sees it, most contem-
porary composers inhabit an ivory
tower, removed from the marketplace
where dwells the mass of people wfyo
listen to music and go to concerts.
Many contemporary works are quite
incomprehensible to the ordinary
music-lover, and not much clearer
even to the skilled musician. In this
situation, everyone loses, and it is time
that composers started taking .more
notice of the tastes and demands of
the larger musical public, which pays
the piper and therefore ought to be
given the chance, once in a while, to
call the tune.
Dreyfus’ solution to this problem
has been the drastic one of renouncing
the ivory tower completely. His output
during his term at the ANU has all
been oriented toward the ordinary
listener. In a situation where most
other composers would have taken the
opportunity to write something am-
bitious and unrelated to popular taste,
Dreyfus has steadily pursued the aim
of getting across to a big audience. “I
don’t want to write masterpieces,” he
says. “I simply want to write music
that communicates with a real audience,
not just with the few people interested
in modern music.”
MUTED CHATTER
“TWO-WAY radio is definitely not a
passing trend,” said Radio 2SM’s
manager, Kevin O’Donohue, last June.
Last week, commercial two-way radio
in Sydney — where it has been noisiest
— began passimg into the limbo of dis-
carded trends, and 2SM, one of Aus-
tralia’s most conscientiously abrasive
practitioners of the talk shows, was
back, predominantly, with the Top 40.
Commercial radio is almost completely
obeisant to audience survey ratings and
it was a recent Sydney survey that
pointed to a slump in popularity of hot-
air programming. The slump hit 2SM
hardest, because it was devoting 12
hours a day of its programming to the
talk shows. But the speed with which
the station wiped all but one of its
talkers off the air was dramatically
sudden, even in an industry where
healthy survival depends on a quick
shuffle; they disappeared faster than
the same station’s disc jockeying Good
Guys, several borrowed ideas ago.
Melbourne radio, it seems, has not
yet felt the slump. The two commercial
stations — 3AW and 3DB — which
make extensive use of talkback pro-
grams, report they are “holding re-
markably well,” “extremely popular,”
and going “from strength to strength.”
But the premise on which the stations
are investing their faith in the trend
is dubious — “Talkback radio has been
going well in the U.S. for 13 years;
we can’t see why it shouldn’t do well
here.” That’s what they said in Sydney.
And it is as shaky as marketing seal
meat in Alice Springs on the basis that
it sells well in Iceland. Still, by cease-
lessly shifting ground to suit the
slightest murmur of changing public
tastes, commercial radio in Australia
stays commercially healthy, at least.
Last week Radio 2UE in Sydney
announced a net profit of $553,962.

THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
SHAW IN CLOSE-UP
Major Barbara. George Bernard Shaw.
Russell Street- Theatre, Melbourne.
SOME YEARS AGO on these very
pages, after careful study of my large
collection of ticket stubs, I propounded
Adams’ First Law, which states that the
distance of a reviewer’s seats from the
stage is inversely proportional to the
warmth of his previous review. As proof
of the truth of this maxim, I am
usually forced to view the mummers
from the top of the gods. Now I realise
that all these years perspective has
vastly reduced my involvement in the
medium. For theatre is really remark-
ably impactive. It’s just a matter of
insinuating oneself into the front row.
Watching “Major Barbara” at these
close quarters was reassuringly like
the movies or television. Instead of
looking like pygmies or Tintookies,
actors were as large as life and loomed
into satisfying close-ups. One was
enthralled by details of make-up 1 , by a
thread hanging from a costume, by the
occasional droplet of saliva sent orbit-
ing during declamatory moments. So
perhaps I should modify my excite-
ment with John Sumner’s production
in the light of my heady proximity to
it.
Shaw put a Machiavellian munitions
millionaire into confrontation with a
formidable Christian soldier in the
person of his daughter, a major in the
Salvation Army. The ensuing battle,
with its semantic juggling, ironies, and
humor, makes Arthur Miller’s analogous
work “All My Sons” read like a poor
Calwell speech. It is surprising how
little punch or relevance Shaw’s play
has lost in almost 70 years.
It’s a matter of academic record
that Shaw had the second largest
vocabulary in English letters, Shake-
speare being a clear winner, and James
Joyce running a poor third. And not
only did Shaw- use his words with
consumate elegance and skill but he
managed to give his ideas adequate
dramatic expression. At heart, Shaw’s
plays are certainly Fabian debates he
held with himself for want of more
challenging competition, but few of
his plays degenerate into mere talk-
ins. While “Major Barbara” provides
him with any number of pulpits and
stumps, it still crackles with character
conflicts.
The play is long, and even with
Sumner’s usual insistence on pace it
was almost 11.30 when Major Barbara
decided to renounce “the bribe of
bread” and the private ecstasies of soup-
kitchen soul-saving. But the time passed
quickly not only because of Shaw’s
impossible cleverness but because of
the skill of the cast. Elspeth Ballantyne,
an acti'ess of tremendous physical and
emotional energy, gave her best per-
formance to date, while Dennis Olsen
was deft and subtle as her infatuated
Professor of Greek. Patricia Kennedy


and Frank Thring are happy in roles
broad enough to contain their full-
blown styles, and Graeme Blundell,
George Whaley, and a half a dozen
others give excellent support.
THEATRE/VICTOR EMELJANOW
ADVENTURE IN HOBART
THE FIRST fully professional produc-
tion in Australia of Peter Nichols’ play
“A Day in the Death of Joe Egg”
has taken place in — hurrah for ad-
venture! — the Theatre Royal, Hobart.
The Melbourne Theatre Company pro-
duction, directed by George Ogilvie,
has opened in Hobart prior to its Mel-
bourne season and is both an artistic
and administrative achievement.
That the premiere took place in
Hopart is due to the enterprise of
Rodney Morice, the new business
manager of the Theatre Royal — a
qualified medical practitioner who has
relinquished his practice to administer
the Royal and invigorate theatre in
Tasmania. Morice, this year, has at-
tracted several mainland touring com-
panies to play at the Royal, trying to
encourage use of it as a pre-season try-
out theatre in much the same way
that plays are tried out in British or
U.S. provinces before moving to the
West End or Broadway. Such a policy
not only allows actors and directors
time to consolidate or modify in the
light of audience reactions but also
gives a much larger public the oppor-
tunity of seeing the latest plays and
productions by top-rate companies.
We need this sort of cross-fertilisa-
tion in Australia, but, unfortunately, it
is extremely rare. Sporadic interstate
tours of plays seemingly chosen at ran-
dom with no cohesion or overall policy
is just not adequate. The success of
the co-operation between the Mel-
bourne and Hobart branches of the
Elizabethan Trust should afford satis-
faction and inspiration.
The value of the overall policy has
been ably demonstrated by Rodney
Morice. For years the magnificent
Georgian Theatre Royal has been the
Trust’s bete noire, but this year the
theatre has not been dark. Max Adrian,
Maggie and Frank, John Sumner’s
production of “The Crucible,” “Stair-
case” from the Independent Theatre in
Sydney, the Trust’s Opera Company
and the Australian Ballet, Barry
Humphries, and Margaret Webster
have all appeared in the past five
months, and the year will end with a
production of “America Hurrah,” and
Googie Withers and John McCallum
in “Relatively Speaking.” But Morice
has not lost sight of the need to foster
local talent. The thriving Tasmanian
Youth Theatre ensures that there is a
source of young people ready to tackle
either Gilbert and Sullivan, experi-
mental plays, or play-readings, while
directors are imported to give local
actors experience and training.
ART/ELWYN LYNN
TOWARD NEW TERRAINS
Twenty-two Artists. Gallery A, Sydney.
James Clifford. Watters Gallery, Syd-
ney.
THIS WEEK could be treated as the
occasion of a mild, minor salon des
refuses if more important issues were not
at stake; at Watters may be seen James
Clifford’s Evolution of a Landscape, a
key work in his one-man show, and at
Gallery A, Aspden’s Window 111,
Ostoja’s Lumina, and Peter Powditch’s
Sun-Day, all of which were unjustly re-
jected from the Transfield. It is clear
now that artists excluded from the
Transfield should, for the sake of
posterity’s judgment, glue their reject
notices on the backs of their paintings.
The important issue is why artists have
become so suddenly and defiantly bored
with the canons of flatness and self-
containment. Just as The Field is win-
ning migrants for the flat-lands, artists
seek new terrains, and James Clifford
has turned his back on the new abstrac-
tion and notions of stylistic homogeneity.
He combines Lichtenstein dots and flat
’twenties abstractions with collage-like
juxtapositions of Renaissance and
lugubrious Victorian scenes. Most of
the landscape elements, which are
separated by rigid, flat areas and bands,
are fuzzy, out-of-focus, and faded, and
to Gauguin’s notion that a picture must
not have a hole in it, Clifford replies
with soft, vaporous skies which, like
Magritte’s, could go on to infinity.
Incidentally, tough forms are similarly
associated with vaporishness at Gallery
A, where Wright shows a piece of broad,
U-shaped sky and Nott an air-vent illus-
ionistically arising from the atmosphere.
Clifford has something of Margritte’s
uncanniness, but his ideas are about art
rather than unconscious forces. As much
of the work is distinctly indecisive, it’s
not easy to see what he is at, though
his title, “Cinematic Landscapes,” indi-
cates that he wants to present simul-
taneous stills of the same or similar
landscapes.
Blow-up ($800), a fuzzy landscape,
has three triangular “inserts” that are
more intensely lit than the rest of the
painting but do not show more detail;
in fact, one triangle reduces the land-
scape, crystallises it so that it seems to
have been cut out of a smaller, brighter
version. Clifford continually makes us
invent and complete areas of landscape
by showing us, in the mode of the
cubists, certain normally unseen facets,
and presenting simultaneously changing
appearances that Monet could get only
in a series of separate paintings. Oddly
enough, at Gallery A, Graesse’s St.
George, a machine-gun marriage
(George has a machine-gun himself) of
modern magic-realist and Renaissance
modes, has George fighting the dragon
in the distance and the dead dragon
in the foreground. Clifford is not after
such narrative simultaneity, but
increases the sense of simultaneity by
using the non-narrative past as his
media. His technique is uncertain, but
he’s exploring something unique and
curious.
At Gallery A the academic canons
of modernism are receiving similar
pressures and the show that heralds the
gallery’s fifth year heralds a revolt;
Firth-Smith, until recently clear-cut, has
returned to a swampy painterliness;
Ostoja s Lumina ($600) is no longer
contented to let optical devices animate
the surface, for from his silver paint-
ing, criss-crossed with thin lines, leaps
a silver wing that’s the essence of levi-
tation; Powditch, who only likes flat-
ness when it’s associated with Arp-like
bas-relief, ironically treats the razor-like
waves, the sand, the blonde, and her
towel as synthetic objects symbolic of
the beach as bore. Aspden, whose flat-
tened shapes of six months ago looked
like flags, now floats them, with
feathered edges on'a fluctuating sea of
Stan Ostoja with his painting “Lumina”'
reds, and (oh, iconoclast) lets them
fall out the side of the painting.
Treweeke continues Aspden’s revolt
against sour, cool, and wan color; his
modules, so firmly associated with phos-
phorescent glow and fugitive hues,
are now dark and enigmatic; Janet
Dawson’s splendid Trout ($1000) is
painterly satire: she defies Larry
Poons’ ellipses to still her greenish-
orange flickering surface and, having-
created two-dimensional effects, covers
an actual, three-dimensional box on the
bottom in the same style to make it
two-dimensional. So much for the
canon of flatness. Michael Johnson’s
Insult ($750) further injures flatness
and Peter Clarke’s beautifully hued
Crypt ($1000) reveals the impatience
he is feeling with a flatness that is
alien to his temperament. Outside,
Tony Coleing’s thin, plastic rods whip
waywardly through the air as though
inviting Robert Brown, whose severe
blue-and-brown sculpture is like junk
tidied up by functionalism, to give his
formal imagination the freedom that
Caro gave his at the recent Contem-
porary Art Society show.

MEN WHO SOUGHT
A "NEW ORDER"
AND FOUND JAIL
By PETER COLEMAN
The Puzzled Patriots: the story of the
Australia First Movement. Bruce
Muirden. M.U.P. $6.75.
I FIRST met P. R. Stephensen about
ten years ago when out of the blue he
appeared in my office at The Observer
to congratulate me on an article I had
just published in the WE A maga-
zine on Georges Sorel. “I’m an old
Sorelian, too,” he cackled. I was
flattered and confused. Flattered that
anyone should think the article deserved
a call, confused to be linked with P. R.
Stephensen. What he meant became
clearer as he rattled on about Sorel,
Joan of Arc, and Charles Maurras (not
really my Sorel), and then just as
suddenly as he had appeared he dis-
appeared.
I had read most of his works some
years before and had once toyed with
the idea of writing a book on the
Australia First internments as a civil
liberties story the book which Bruce
Muirden has now written so conscien-
tiously and definitively. As an under-
graduate in the late 19405, his 1930 s
blast against the derivative character of
our dominant institutions had got me
in, and his appeals to what I then
naively took to be patriotic idealism
seemed to add an element of martyr-
dom to his internment, especially since
internment for so long years)
seemed in fact was unjustified.
Stephensen appeared to be a good case
of the revolutionary intellectual in
Knopfelmacher’s sense, a man whose
critique dominated his life, who lived
for ideas and was even imprisoned for
them—q classic test. His career also
had the interest as the subject for a
book of the early Communist turned
Fascist, of the Rhodes Scholar turned
Anglophobe, of the literateur turned
political-cult leader.
But I couldn’t sustain the illusion. His
nationalism, basic to the story, seemed
to disappear under analysis. In his
writings he loathed everything in Aus-
tralia, not only the all-pervasive British
and American influences but all the
native traditions, which he called
larrikinism. I read a long article on
Bakunin he had written in the 1920 s
in his English magazine “The London
Aphrodite,” and this seemed to me a
key to him. He was not a nationalist, a
respecter or reformer of national tradi-
tions, but a revolutionary with an
anarchist vision of destruction and
catastrophe. Hence his later interest in
the Japanese and Nazism: it arose not
from ultra-nationalism but from a vision
of Australia destroyed, to be followed,
maybe, by a New Order with nothing
in common with the despised Australia
of his and our time. At this point I lost
interest in Stephensen except as a man
who had been treated badly. I was not
even sure if he was still alive.
Then he popped up in my office
as a Sorelian. I saw more of him after
that. We got his well-known “Observer”
article (“Why Dr. Evatt Put Me in
Gaol”), and when Australian Consoli-
dated Press bought The Bulletin he
turned up again to say what wonderful
news it was and that we should immed-
iately rename the Plain English column
Plain Australian. We didn’t. (Years be-
fore Stephensen had sued The Bulle-
tin for a defamatory book review and
won £750 damages.)
He was always in and out of the
office. He would talk of his days as
a fine printer and as the first publisher
of D. H. Lawrence’s “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover,” of his translations of Lenin and
Nietzsche, his dealings with James
Joyce, his dispute with Xavier Herbert.
I grew to like him and understood
the stories of his capacity to mesmerise
followers, and although he was always
Percy to me, not “Inky” (“Inky” was
reserved for old, true friends dating
back to internment days), he gave me
a copy of his “Foundations of Culture
in Australia,” in which he inscribed
“Rari nantes in gurgite vasto.” He also
wrote “Peter Coleman, Vitalist”
(we’d been talking about Vincent
Buckley’s criticism). Then he took up
the pen again and added a ? after
Vitalist.
But too many of his ideas were
intolerable. In the middle of literary
talk, he’d slip in some blast at “niggers”
or Catholics (whom he called “cattle-
ticks”) and once I remember him pro-
claiming almost symbolically: “One of
these days I’ll write something that
will make all of you drop me entirely.”
It was probably a special blast at the
Jews. Despite all his charm and
effervescence in other moods, it became
for me an increasingly hopeless job to
talk with him rather than simply listen
to him. After his struggle with Angus
and Robertson, I saw little of him, and
the last time I met him was when he
wrote a review rubbishing a book I had
just edited, “Australian Civilisation,”
and the same day it appeared he invited
me to lunch at Attilio’s. (I was still
young enough to be impressed when a
solemn headwaiter inquired whether
the steak was satisfactory and Stephen-
sen said “No.”)
By this time his stories about
Lawrence and Joyce began to show
inconsistencies, and I began to wonder.
I was too busy to attend a lecture of
his on D. H. Lawrence in 1962, at
which he dropped dead. I wrote an
obituary playing down his Fascism and
playing up his eulogy of Sir Isaac
Isaacs. Pretty wet, but it was the best
I could do and I wanted to acknow-
ledge this remarkable and impossible
man.
The Australia First internments
remain one of the scandals of Australian
history. Sixteen Sydney men, none of
whom could be shown to have lifted
so much as a finger against the war
effort, were arrested and interned in
1942. At a later inquiry Mr. Justice
Clyne held that eight of them should
not have been arrested; he considered
that the other eight were so anti-British
and/or totalitarian in sympathy, that
although they did nothing about it,
preventive arrest was justified in the
circumstances.
These eight, including Stephensen,
have produced most of the sympathy
and publicity, but nowadays I feel more
sympathetic to the others against whom
there was hardly even a case, but
whose lives and careers were disrupted
in an hysterical wave of arrests and to
whom the Commonwealth had to pay
a few pounds by way of apology and
compensation.
The others had done nothing overt
to justify internment, but it is not
surprising that, in a country whose
towns are being bombed by the Japanese
and whose survival is in doubt, men
who, one or another of them, go
around dabbling in Nazi ideas, express-
ing admiration of totalitarian leaders,
"Australia
First”
president,
P. R. Stephensen
referring to Australians as “gutless
swine” and our soldiers as mercenaries,
despising everything British as decadent,
discussing with each other the desira-
bility of a “separate peace” —it is not
surprising that such men are watched,
restricted, or even, in an emergency,
unjustly interned.
Bruce Muirden’s book is an excellent
account. Naturally, the emphasis is on
Stephensen and his backer, W. J. Miles,
who died before the internments (having
run a sweep on which day he would
go). He traces the story from “The
Publicist” to the Yabber Club, to the
famous meetings in the Adyar Hall of
which the anarchist poet Oliver Somer-
ville wrote:
The meeting in the Adyar Hall
Became a most unseemly brawl

at one stage held 7500 people) and the
fruitless fight for vindication. Muirden
tells it as a cautionary tale: “If I am
forced to sum up a complicated situa-
tion in the search for a central message
it would be that we have seen how a
small group of politically active
people with few friends in Government
could be removed from sight and
hearing as a result of what, quickly
enough, was seen to be a foolish mistake.
It certainly cannot be ignored that
1942 was a time of definite danger to
Australia. There was no precedent for
the handling of dissident opinion on
such an occasion, for there had never
been such a threat before. Drastic
measures may well have been justified.
“Further, the aftermath of the intern-
ments revealed yet again (as had the
IWW jailings in 1916) the enormous
reluctance of the Government to admit
it may have been at fault in allowing
such an unambiguous assault on per-
sonal liberty. Should civil libertarians
in this country need any more caution-
ary tales, this is one.”
It is a balanced book, and on this
case probably the last word. But it is
a last word that deserves to be read and
remembered if in any future crises we
are to avoid these hurtful and shameful
blunders.
NICOLSON ROUNDED OUT
By ERNEST BRAMSTED
Diaries and Letters 1945-1962. Harold
Nicolson. Edited by Nigel Nicolson.
Collins. $5.65.
A FRIEND ONCE described Harold
Nicolson as “a national figure of the
second degree.” This last of the three
volumes of his Diaries and Letters which
begins after he had lost his seat in
the House of Commons in the General
Election of 1945 and ends with the
death of his wife raises the question:
was Nicolson a writer who dabbled in
politics or a politician who took refuge
in literature? The answer cannot be
equivocal . . . this urbane ex-diplomat,
who died last May, proved in the last
analysis to be a failure in politics, but a
considerable success in literature as a
commentator, biographer, and essayist.
He was an elitist with a sense of social
justice, “a mixture of an aristocrat and
a bohemian,” as he once called himself.
A former supporter of Ramsay Mac-
Donald, he had represented the splinter
group of National Labor, which, in
Westminster, enjoyed Tory support from
1935 to 1945. Later he turned to the
Labor Party and fought the North Croy-
don by-election for it in 1948. It was
a serious mistake, for Nicolson had no
inner affinity with the Labor Party.
With the candor that distinguishes so
many of his diary entries, he admitted
later that his joining the Party had been
“the cardinal error of my life.”
With all his charm and urbanity, he
was never a good political actor. Like
Robert Cecil, the champion of the
League of Nations Union in the inter-
war years, Nicolson never joined the
Liberals, the one Party to which he was
best suited by temperament. In his
attitude to society and politics, he had,
I think, much common ground with the
French Liberal aristocrat Alexis de
Tocqueville, 130 years earlier. In the
case of both writers, their intelligence
and conscience led them to express
opinions to which their education and
social milieu was opposed.
It is true that before and during
World War II Nicolson, who had
excellent contacts with the French, and
was for some years a Governor of the
BBC, exercised considerable political in-
fluence. But even then he never gained
political power. His appointment as
Under-Secretary in the war-time
Ministry of Information lasted only a
year, and, although there were imper-
sonal reasons for his omission in the
reshuffle of the Coalition, he, himself,
later ascribed it to his lack of ambition
and drive.
After the war, Nicolson never re-
gained his earlier political influence.
Nor did he obtain the peerage for which
he had hoped when agreeing to stand
as Labor candidate in the North Croy-
don by-election. The reason was not
that he lost to his Conservative oppon-
ent but that afterwards he made some
very candid and unflattering comments
about the campaign and the Labor
bureaucracy in his regular article for
the Conservative weekly “Spectator.”
The Labor bosses took exception and
Harold Nicolson was left alone with
his nostalgia for Parliament, to which
he was not destined to return.
The truth was that, basically, Nicol-
son was too independent for political
compromise and too much of a candid
and, at times, snobbish observer in the
wings to please the Whips of any
Party. Prejudices he had and they did
not diminish with age, but his humanism
was stronger than these prejudices. He
abhorred cruelty and injustice. “I can-
not describe to you the horrors of
apartheid,” he wrote to his sons from
South Africa in January, 1960. “It is
far, far worse than anything I had sup-
posed.” He was shocked when first
landing at Durban. He observed that
all the seats along the esplanade were
marked “For whites only.” He was
shocked when he found that in the
vast Post Office at Cape Town there
were counters for the whites and sep-
arate counters for the Negroes. “In
fury, I queued up behind these Negroes,
but when my turn came the clerk said
to me, ‘Sorry, sir, you are at the wrong
desk.’ The clerk was, himself, black. So
my demonstration was fruitless.” The
end of the letter is telling. “You know
how I hate Negroes and how Tory Vita
(his wife) is. But I do hate injustice
more than I hate Negroes, and Vita
screams with rage . . . The complete
Police State. How happy we are with
our freedom and parliamentary ques-
tions. I could not live in this Nazi
country in constant fear of the Gestapo.”
In 1956, Harold Nicolson was, from
the beginning, sharply opposed to
Eden’s adventure over Suez. Even more

The Savoy Plaza is one of Melbourne’s most popular hotels,
right at the centre of things. Across the road from the major
interstate rail terminal, a few minutes from the airway
terminals, just a step from the city’s commercial hub and a
leisurely stroll to Collins Street, famed for its shops, restaurants
and theatres.
It has a brand new Convention Centre and everything that
goes to make for well organised, smooth-running conventions,
big or small.
The Savoy offers top class accommodation and round-the-
clock room service seven days a week, with liquor at bottle
shop prices between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays.
On the spot there’s the exciting atmosphere and superb
entertainment of the Rainbow Room Restaurant and for
something a little more active the Bavarian heartiness of
the Keller.
With all this, no wonder the Savoy Plaza is popular.
A phone call to your nearest Federal Group hotel will bring
immediate teleprinter confirmation of your booking at the

CHARLES JOHANSEN BOOKS
Box 85, Glenelg, South Australia, 5045.
so was his son, Nigel, then a Conserva-
tive MP, who, by his opposition, lost
the confidence of his constituents in
Bournemouth, and eventually his seat
in Westminster. When Eden resigned
as Prime Minister a few months after
the Suez crisis, Nigel Nicolson wrote to
his father from the House of Commons:
“Everybody feels such a load of depres-
sion about it. It is partly because an
ill man was led by illness into folly and
partly because his successors have to
pretend it wasn’t folly at all. Everyone
as a result is confused. Nobody is
acknowledged to have emerged well out
of this business. There are no heroes.
Only different traitors.”
As a political and literary biographer
of distinction, Harold Nicolson was
neither given to hero-worship nor to
the debunking of the Lytton Strachey
school. He let his characters speak for
themselves, but he also characterised
and summed them up deftly. The best
book he wrote after giving up politics
is his biography “King George V: His
Life and Reign.” Unlike his other
works it was based on primary source
material, mainly from the Royal
Archives in Windsor; he worked for
three years on it and interviewed many
survivors of the period, including Queen
Mary. He handled the vast historical
material in an unsensational and bal-
anced manner, and his gift for pro-
portion and literary embroidery shine
through it conspicuously.
He found the work a most congenial
task; yet when the book was hailed by
the critics in 1952, Nicolson noted can-
didly in his diary: “The whole effect
is one of wide and lengthy adulation.
How much of this is due to the very
real respect that people have for King
George? Never have I witnessed such
a chorus of praise. I suppose I ought
to feel elated. But, somehow, I am
rather indifferent and do not experi-
ence any inner feelings of self-
satisfaction, Christobel (Aberconway)
says this is due to my ‘loss of vitality.’
Yes, I am becoming an old man.”
Despite his zest for intelligent talk
and good company Nicolson was more
at home in the pre-war than in the
post-war world, and the editor is right
in describing this volume in the Intro-
duction as “the attempt of a highly
civilised man to come to terms with new
men and movements wholly alien to
him.” Nicolson disliked propaganda
both for and against an attitude or in-
stitution and he was out of sympathy
with the new generation of protesters.
“What a world we live in,” he
lamented in his diary in May, 1958.
“The sense of authority has decayed,
and the young revolt against the old
and the irresponsible against the
responsible. I suppose that something
of the same sort occurred after the
French Revolution, but people were
then mainly uneducated and could not
be driven to violence by propaganda,”
a view which is only partly correct.
Nicolson was catholic in his appreci-
ation of such different figures as
Churchill and Ramsay MacDonald,
Eden, and Ernest Bevin. When
Aneurin Bevan died in 1960, he de-
plored “the loss of this spendid colored
figure and a great parliamentarian and
patriot.” While English Party labels
meant little to him, for people outside
the Western orbit like Khrushchev or
Nkrumah he lacked all understanding.
(The name of Sukarno does not even
figure in the Index.)
This diarist had many political,
Nicolson in 1945. .. candid, snobbish
observer in the wings
diplomatic, and literary friends, Contin-
ental, American as well as British, and
they often came in the evening to his
“prestige” chambers at Albany, Picca-
dilly, to relax, enjoy good talk and
shared conceptions of fun. Yet gay and
amusing as he was as a host, the end-
of-the-year reflections in his diary are
often gloomy. Note, for instance, the
entry at the close of 1950 which saw
the war in Korea: “So ends a horrible
year with worse to come. The year
closes in a mist of anxiety . . . We
shall be lucky if we get through 1951
without a war.” Ten years later when
Nicolson had experienced serious illness
and the shadows of old age were upon
him, the diary review of the year
ended on a similarly grim note: “Let
1960 go. It has been a beastly year.
The rainfall between July and the end
of the year has been heavier than for
a century. The Communist world has
gained over the liberal world from Laos
to Cuba. The African situation is
dreadful. Our own economic situation
is only precariously prosperous. My
‘Age of Reason’ has been criticised
for misprints, misspellings, repetitions,,
and careless writing. I know that is
because I am going gaga.”
Nicolson’s last book, “Monarchy”
(1962), met with a cool reception
from the critics, and soon afterward
he discontinued his regular and often
distinguished reviewing of books for
the London “Observer.” ' (Aneurin
Bevan had once said of him as a

reviewer: “Harold is not malicious at
all. He is the angel of pity.”)
Until the death of his wife in 1962
there existed between them a very
distinct, and perhaps unique, tie. Vita
Sackville West, poet, novelist, and
biographer, had strong and often
exclusive views. It was a rare rela-
tionship that emerges from these pages.
Both were gifted writers, both keen on
their own ways and yet deeply attached
to each other. She disliked London and
altogether cared more for places than
for people. Pie needed London “as an
Athenian needed Athens.”
INDISPENSABLE, BUT
BY ELWYN LYNN
Encyclopaedia of Australian Art. Alan
McCulloch. (668 pages; 32 pages in
color, 64 in black and white.)
Hutchinson. $17.50.
McCULLOCH’S pioneer, alphabetical
guide to the visual arts and art estab-
lishments in Australia is part-
encyclopaedia and part-dictionary, and
ranges from the engagingly discursive
to almost pointless entries. One of his
methods of determining inclusions
the winning of a prize leads to
entries like, “Bennett, Jack. Painter;
awarded prizes at Albury competitions,
1953, 1957, 1958” but it also tells
us that Rolf Harris won prizes in
Western Australia in 1949 and 1958.
His other criteria for inclusion are:
purchased for an Australian public
collection; significant contribution to
writing on art; referred to in an existing
book on Australian art or in a State
gallery catalogue; an outstanding
general contribution to Australian art
development.
This does not give much chance to
the anti-prize artist and loner; it cer-
tainly reveals one of the curiosities of
the Australian art world—the import-
ance of being bought by a gallery or of
winning a prize; McCulloch’s criteria
could not be used effectively in England
or America, where excellence and
achievement are more closely associated
with dealer-connoisseurs. It would be
too much to require Mr. McCulloch to
indicate just how State galleries buy
and to list the judges of prizes, for to
win a prize or be bought by a gallery is
no proof of excellence, but to have had
an important one-man show in a
prestigious commercial gallery does not
necessarily win an artist a place in the
book. Further, since N.S.W. has about
two-thirds of the prizes and spends
almost four times as much as any other
State on them, and since the N.S.W.
gallery has a fairly comprehensive col-
lection of its State’s art, the scales are
weighed in N.S.W.’s favor; but, then,
would a N.S.W. encyclopaedist have
enlightened us about Mr. Bernard
Boles, a lively letter-column contro-
versialist, or have told us that Brancusi’s
model, Margit Pogany, arrived in Aus-
tralia in 1948 and died here in 1964,
no doubt with an ironic sigh about the
fact that Brancusi’s sculpture of her,
shown at the New York Armory Show
in 1913, was refused by the National
Gallery of Victoria, but was bought by
New York’s Museum of Modern Art?
The work has quite a few inside
stories and wry comments: how could
the same Sir Lionel Lindsay fight for
the 1943 Archibald Award’s going to
Dobell and in the same year produce
his “Addled Art,” a violent, anti-
Semitic diatribe against modernism?
McCulloch obliquely condemns the
amateurs who ruined the excellent
magazine “Australian Artist,” and so
on; yet, he is too tender with such
bodies as the Commonwealth Art
Advisory Board.
It is not just the biographical details
on artists and writers on art that make
the book essential; his general pieces
are excellent, including those on com-
mercial galleries (Central Street is
omitted), State galleries, flora and
fauna artists, black and white art (some
omissions here Petty and Martin
Sharp are mentioned elsewhere, but
not in this section; Les Tanner is no-
where), the various art societies and
criticism. Among the critics is Alan

Societies are reasonably well dealt
with, but you might gather the impres-
sion that the N.S.W. Society of Artists
is flourishing, when it looks quite dead,
and that the N.S.W. Contemporary Art
Society exists mainly for artists to give
prizes to artists.
Mr. McCulloch keeps his love of
anecdotes under strict control, but he
could not resist quoting the “South
Australian Register” (June 18, 1845)
on Frederick Nixon’s Views in Adelaide,
“which were not intrinsically wortja a
farthing . . . our opinion of Mr. Nixon
as a mere ‘Bastard’ has long been
formed.” (What is a bastard in in-
verted commas?)
Sometimes space is curiously appor-
tioned, and often accounts are incom-
plete, such as those on Brack, Judy
Cassab (distinguished for abstraction
as well as portraiture), Australian Art
Overseas (no details on Venice Bien-
, , .. r .i , ncc c
nale representation or of the 1966 San
„. r T * , , . , Y
Francisco-Los Angeles show), and Lo
Schiavos (those at Sydney
University's Union are not mentioned).
It seems ingratitude to point out errors
in a book so crammed with sensible and
accurate information, but every
reviewer will no doubt have to add his
rather insignificant list: Blackman has
not won a Rubinstein Portrait Prize;
Lancelely did not live in Annandale;
Macquarie Galleries moved in 1965, not
1945; Charles Atkinson could not arrive
in Hobart in 1883 and die in 1837;
Director of the S.A. Gallery John Baily
is dethroned a few lines down by his
Deputy, Ron Appleyard; Robert Mel-
ville is not from the Guggenheim but
the “New Statesman;” Stephen Walker
win the Kippax Lake Prize but was
rooked of the commission; Watters
Gallery opened in 1964, not 1965; and
Klippel returned to Australia in 1963,
not 1962. There are some misspellings

Dutenau and the Hemy Castelli
Pnze is, in one place, called the Henri
Castelli Pnze. It is odd to find Enid
Cambndge undei Enid Giay, a name
quite unknown in Austialian art.

that many of the new' wave of artists

tions are accompanied with summary
phrases, some stylistic “Vorticist

“Sculpture from Junk” phrases that
will provoke agreement and dissent
but hardly compensate for the book’s
failure to consider artistic movements.

WINE TO QUAFF
AROUND THE
BACKYARD BARBECUE
SO, MR. TOM CAMPBELL, the
Sydney schoolteacher who recently won
241 bottles of “rare and valuable” wine
to quote the newspaper which ran
the competition thinks there’s noth-
ing worse than people who talk for ever
about bouquet and aroma and tang and
the rest of the bull. Since I make part
of my living by attempting to dissect
the self-same subject, I do not share
Mr. Campbell’s sense of outrage. But
I do share some of his other opinions.
Wine need not necessarily be
quaffed, but that is a damn good way
to drink a lot of it. And, in his expressed
aggressive approach to wine, Mr.
Campbell speaks for many of his gen-
eration. I often wonder if the wine
industry knows what has hit it. Is it
aware, I muse over my glass, of the
enormous interest the younger genera-
tion has in wine? Most of them cannot
afford the prices for private bins and
specials these days. Many do not want
to be weighed down with the endless
year, region, variety, soil, maturation,
the southern slope of the knacker’s-yard-
type information. But they do want to
drink it. And what do they drink most
of? Flagon wine.
There is little doubt that this is the
wine that will form the basis of con-
sumption within five years. As the
younger people drinking flagon wine
today become wealthier and more
aware of bouquet, aroma, and tang they
will drink better and more expensive
wines. (Though they may continue to
enjoy the occasional drop of rough red
from the jar.) Replacing them will be
the hoards of today’s under-20s, who are
aware of wine, aware of the fun and
the pleasure that lies in the moderate
use of wine, people who read the
articles and books being written and
who feel this may not be a bad idea
at all. And replacing them in seven
years’ time . . .
If this is ever to become a wine-
drinking nation, every Australian will
have to drink at least two gallons of
flagon table wine per year. Strangely,
we do not see a great deal written
about the various qualities of wine sold
in flagons. Part of the reason is that,
unlike the cigarette, it often varies. I
once recommended a particular brand
to one of my listeners only to be reviled
by him a month later. Subsequent
inspection has forced me to agree.
When I mentioned the complaint to a
winemaker friend, he said: “When was
that? Oh, yes, that wasn’t a very good
batch we sent over.”
This makes it difficult to be categori-
cal. I always applauded the Buring’s
dry white and red that used to be
available at a very reasonable price.
Then their big brother came along and
took it away. In N.S.W. the Penfold’s
and McWilliam’s blends are always
most consistent. I’ve seen good wine
from Hardy’s, especially a red, in a
flagon, and also a light red from
Hamilton’s that made very good back-
yard-barbecue drinking. Some of the
best flagon red I have seen came from
the Reynella and Mildara companies,
though one does not see much of these
wines.
The greatest improvement in flagon
wine I have observed has been made
by Gramp and Sons with their Orlando
Coolibah line. A mate of mine used
to rave over their red. I tasted it and
it was full and/ coarse and slightly
sweet at the time. A couple of years
later it is lighter, has better fruit and
flavor, and quite good balance. Their
white is definitely the best of those
I’ve tasted lately.
Kaiser Stuhl also market some good
whites and reds, though it seems to me
they can be inconsistent. It’s a ques-
tion of keeping after them. And don’t
believe that people do not attempt to
keep informed. Like a friendly head-
waiter, a young journalist whispered to
me the other day, ‘'Have you tried X’s
red lately? It’s very good this week.”
But these recommendations are limited
by the fact that the flagons vary from
State to State. A major company can
fill in three or more States and the
wine will probably come from the
nearest company source. One maker
told me he varied the blend because
different markets liked different styles.
In Western Australia I was even served
a glass of flagon sparkling burgundy.
When I queried the style I was in-
formed that it was a young red, about
two months old, bottled immediately
after making because “my customers
like it young and fizzy” a perfectly
satisfactory answer.
Of a couple of things I’m ’ fairly
certain. One is that per unit of
money earned per hour, our flagon
wines are the cheapest and best in the
world. Wines of other nations ,may be
cheaper, but it takes a darn sight
longer in those countries to earn the
money to pay for them. My second cer-
tainly is the belief that our flagon wines
are going to get even better, as the
makers improve techniques for hand-
ling this bulk material.
I believe the ideal style of both white
and red should be light, fresh, fruity,
and soft on the palate with a clean,
crisp finish. And though I’m sorry to
dash the fond hopes of those who
think they may be able to buy cheaply
to rebottle and store away for years,
these wines should be enjoyed when
young. They are, and will be, made to
be thus treated, for flagon wines are
quaffing wines and, however small the
margin of profit, are a large part
of the future of the industry. I would
like to meet Mr. Tom Campbell to
hear more of his refreshing attitude
to wine. We might even share one of
his 241 bottles.
Cellar notes
from
Lindeman’s
WE ARE frequently asked to explain
the difference between Claret and Bur-
gundy in Australia. The questioner
invariably points out that most Aus-
tralian Clarets and Burgundies are
made from the same variety of grapes,
and that many companies market both
types of wine, a produce of the same
winery or vineyard.
To answer the question fully it is neces-
sary first of all to point out that in the
English language Claret and Burgundy
are generic names which for several cen-
turies have come to indicate certain
styles of wine, rather than the produce
of any given area or variety of grapes,
notwithstanding that these wines origin-
ated in France. The terms themselves
are not even used by the French, but
are English words to indicate Bordeaux
Dry Reds and Burgoyne Dry Reds
respectively. These are produced from
different grape varieties in different
areas with different climates and under
different conditions and hence the basic
difference between the two types. Colour
and body are no criteria there being
light Bordeaux and dark Burgoynes and
vice versa but invariably the Bor-
deaux reds (clarets) have a tannin acid
astringency and flavour in marked con-
trast to the roundness and softness of
nose and palate of the Burgoyne reds
(burgundies).
At Lindemans we endeavour to grade
and blend our dry red according to
these basic differences in style, and the
extent to which we are successful may
be judged by our products. Most other
wine companies attempt to do likewise,
but there is still a great need for many
oenologists and wine judges to arrive
at a proper understanding of the matter.
This is further complicated by a third
basic style of Dry Red in France, viz.,
Rhone Wine and by the fact that the
vast majority of South Australian dry
reds more closely resemble this style than
either Claret or Burgundy.
There are two wine growing areas in
Australia where the wines are unmis-
takable in style, viz., the Hunter River
Valley and Coonawarra. The climates
of these two areas closely resemble those
for Burgoyne and Bordeaux respectively,
and many of the wines produced are
extremely like those from the latter
areas.
Our 1964 Hunter River Burgundy Bin
2925 is a true Burgundy round, soft
and smooth with a fruity nose and palate
while our 1964 Rouge Homme
Coonawarra Claret currently . being
released is a typical Claret dry,
austere and delicately astringent.

Ulster's troubles
Your recent piece “Discord in the
Londonderry Air” (8., October 26) is
full of blatant inaccuracies, giving only
one side of the position in London-
derry and not the other.
The writer talks of the local-govern-
ment franchise and the degree to which
votes in such elections are confined to
ratepayers and householders only. This
was a system inherited by the Northern
Ireland Government from Britain and
not created specially by the Ulster
administration. In any event, the one-
man-one-vote principle applies in
Parliamentary elections and it is Parlia-
ment which decides the local-
government system.
The Government, in fact, has at
present under review the entire local-
government administration, and a plan
will emerge under which housing allo-
cations, education, roads, and other
aspects of their operations will be in
the hands of a different form of
authority. It is a bold plan; it cannot
be put into effect overnight.
I wonder if your correspondent took
time to look at the problems Ulster has
faced: geographical isolation from the
rest of the United Kingdo.m, a rela-
tively small population obviously un-
able to provide by itself the capital
necessary for economic expansion,
traditional industries with a shrinking
labor force, and, to cap it all, the
principal Opposition Party having as
its main aim the complete overthrow
of the Constitution.
Yet, what do we find? More people
in gainful employment than ever be-
fore and the variety of industries now
operating in Northern Ireland un-
dreamt of a generation ago. The 250
firms which make up this strengthened
economy came because they were
attracted by the incentive schemes
which the Unionist Government
devised.
But the fruits of the Government’s
campaign are not just the 70,000 new
jobs in manufacturing which have been
created. The benefit spreads into all the
various industries in the country and
is reflected in greater overall economic
stability. The general standard of living
has been rising steadily.
I am grateful that your correspon-
dent at least acknowledges that new
industrial development has been
attracted to Londonderry, and is pre-
pared to concede that Captain O’Neill,
the Prime Minister, is relied on by a
large majority of Protestants and a
“surprising” number of Roman
Catholics. I don’t know why your
correspondent should use the word
“surprising,” seeing that many prom-
inent Roman Catholics have come out
openly in his support in recent weeks.
Your article in its reference to the
Londonderry mai'ch which led to a
ban by Mr. Craig, Minister of Home
Affairs, is not strictly accurate. The
march was not forbidden; the police
order merely asked them not to pass
along a specific street. The order was
issued in the interests of the peace of
the city. Your contributor says “some
of the marchers decided to go ahead,
anyway.” In fact, the marchers headed
straight for the line of police and the
result was inevitable. Surely the open
defiance of law and order can only
have the one consequence.
Northern Ireland’s Unionist admini-
stration has a,s its aim prosperity and
good living conditions for all its
citizens. It is not in the least afraid
of any fair-minded investigation of the
extent to which it has consistently

What Canada thinks?
Your correspondent who reported “The
Queen Insulted” (8., October 5) gave
a wholly false impression. It is not
perhaps that the reader could pick out
this or that statement and say it was
untrue, but the import of the article
conveys anything but what Canada
thinks and believes.
It is very doubtful if Trudeau is
“a known anti-monarchist,” as the foot-
note to the picture says; certainly he is
far too intelligent a man and a poli-
tician to advocate republicanism in
Canada, where the ties to Great Britain
are not as strong as they were, say, in
1900, but it would be political suicide
for a federal leader to espouse the
cause of republicanism in this country.
Trudeau, who is one of the most
travelled persons in the world, knows
this country from having traversed it,
much of it by canoe, certainly now that
he is Prime Minister, would never lend
himself to such a course of action in
the appreciable future as that of dis-
mantling the monarchy. (Who can say
what AT). 2000 might bring to Britain’s
monarchy in Britain?)
It is believed that ten percent of the
people in Quebec might be Separatist,
but the overwhelming majority given to
Trudeau in the recent election, when
he stood for a united Canada, shows
how ill-informed your correspondent
is. That majority was clear-cut in
Quebec, the home of the Separatists.
“Many English-Canadians seek to
sever existing legal ties to the British
Parliament” is true only to the extent
that most of Canada is in favor of
repatriating the Constitution so that
Amendments can be made in Canada,
and would not require the official
sanction of the British Parliament, who
have more important things to do. No
doubt this will come in time.
