THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILE GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction

,t for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ’’
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size

trade mai k throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

A BIG biz:
Our Trad® is Big I Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Bigl
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Pew Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upop us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.
If living IN THE COUNTRY, send for our
Catalogue and Patterns of anything you require ;
if in town, call every day.

White Spotless Arms
Soft White Hands
Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Outicura. Herne*
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and

When Grandpa Died .
At related by a Melbourne Cremationist.
[For The Bulletin.)
When grandpa died
We called in at the woodyard and we bought the
kerosene,
We mixed up all his virtues with some fuel,
When closed his earthly scene we soaked him in
benzine,
And he took a foretaste of his final “ gruel ”
We toted out his body on a wild and stormy
track,
And when the kindling blazed each lady cried —
Making certain of the fact that he never would
come back,
When grandpa died.
When grandpa died,
We built a coffer-dam of wood, and many a
“ catchy ” thing,
We stuck him in the middle in his shell;
To be certain that his spirit to his legacies don’t
cling
We raised around his form a little hell;
And the smoke smelt like a wasbtub which is
used for making beer,
For in life our grandpa’s breath was like a sink.
And we piled the blue-gum logs on as we dropped
the silent tear,
And thought he never more could take to drink,
And we heaved on tons of sawdust, and incon-
tinently sighed,
When grandpa died.
When grandpa died,
We dressed him in his oldest shirt —for very wrong
is waste —
We wrapped a coil of fuse around hia neck,
A pyrotechnic exit for to make with seemly
haste—
Oli, we made of grandpa such a dandy wreck !
And we gave him all the heat you’d find within a
smelter-blast,
And the firm of Plumes and Woe the match
applied,
And in just 3min. 2sec. he had vanished in the
past—
When grandpa died.
When grandpa died—
He left us each a legacy—we gave him his in
coal —
We spent quite three-pound-ten upon his coffin,
We heaped up coals of fire on him, nor left him
in a. hole,
Altho’ he’d done that same to us quite often.
We sent him up to glory in a pillar of the tire
Which served the Jews along the Red Sea tide,
And we left his ash, and caught the omnibus that
plys for hire —
When grandpa died !

as a criterion. This firm, however, it seems, has
opened new dressmaking rooms specially to cater
for the younger generation, and the combination
of interestingly low prices, elegant taste and high-

Ed. Bulletin, —A champion mean man.
A Northern (Q.) “financier” employs many
hands at the “lowest wage.” He draws
their salaries from the bank in gold at the very
last moment on Saturdays, places the soys, in a
chamois bag at 12 noon, and employs his time
between then and 9 p.m. (pay-time) in vigorously
extracting “ dust ” from the sovs. by friction.
He invariably overpays in gold, gets change from
his employes in silver, which he re-banks on Mon-
day. The dust is extracted from the bag at no
expense, to the great joy of the broker, who is, by
the way, the same man who claimed, as rent, the
egg which was laid on his premises by a duck
that an had put in the “financier’s”
back yard for a few minutes until he could take it
home. — Bris.

The Betterment Problem Again.
It is an acknowledged fact that an intelli-
gent Betterment Act is badly wanted in all
the Australian provinces. It is more espe-
cially an acknowledged fact in New South
Wales, where the agitation for such an Act
has been going on longer and to less purpose
than in most of the other provinces ; but, so
far, the little progress that has been made
has mostly been sideways, and this reform—
which is probably more urgently wanted than
almost any other reform now under con-
sideration—is very much where it was
before. In saying that a Betterment law is
about the most urgent question of the day,
The Bulletin speaks advisedly. The great
trouble throughout the Australias is the
emptiness of the exchequer, the va.‘t burden
of the public debt, the load of inti re J pay-
able annually to the British crcc itor, the
difficulty of constructing new public works,
and the unprofitableness of the works
already constructed. And of these five
calamities, four are chiefly owing to the want
of an efficient Betterment law in the past,
and the fifth is owing to the want of the
same law in the immediate present.
» * •
Victoria, New South Wales and Queens-
land owe among them a public debt of about
£140,000,000. Of this amount about
£100,000,000 has been spent in railways,
according to a beautifully simple plan devised
by the legislative Fat Man for his own sole
use and benefit. When the State proposes
to build a new line it borrows the money for
the purpose, and makes the interest a charge
on the landed and landless classes alike—but
principally on the landless classes because
they are much the more numerous. Then it
buys the land required at an average of some-
ihing like seven times its fair market value.
There is a loud and constant outcry in the
community against tliiv gross fraud upon the
revenue ; yet the separate items of the com-
munity, when they get upon a jury in a
State land-resumption case, ahvays give
the Fat Man a verdict for anything up to
two dozen times the value of his property.
Therefore, so long as the present law
exists, and the community remains the
great aggregate ass it is, the fraud is in-
evitable. The poor, miserable, much-abused
Government is not responsible. When it
compounds with Fat Man privately for an
unspeakably exorbitant sum, and thereby
rouses the people to execration, it does so
with the knowledge, obtained by much pain-
ful experience, that, if it contested the
claim, a jury of these same infuriated critics
would almost certainly give a verdict for an
equally large, or a larger, amount, and con-
demn it to pay costs into the bargain. When
the line is made, at a cost of, say, £500,000,
it enhances the value of property along the
route to an extent that probably ranges
anywhere from £200,000 to a million ; in
many cases the added value is equal to the
cost of the line with the land-resumption
charges thrown in, and is often twice as much
as the actual cost of the line without the
land-resumption charges. The law makes
the fatted proprietor a present of all this
added value created at the public expense,
and then the landlord, in many cases, sells
out and takes his newly-acquired fortune to
England or elsewhere.
• • •
The situation of the Government, there-
fore, is somewhat as follows : There is a con-
stant demand for railways from country
towns anxious for means of communi-
cations, from farmers and squatters desirous
of an outlet for their produce, from
unemployed workers craving for the means
of livelihood, and from landholders
urgent to sell part of their land to
the State at many times its value, and
to have the selling-price of the rest doubled,
or thereabouts, at the cost of the community.
No Government with a decent regal'd for its
billet and its salary can altogether resist this
overwhelming pressure. Therefore, it bor-
rows money for construction purposes
and resumes land at prices which are
equivalent to highway robbery, and the
new lines, owing to the enormous cost
of construction, don’t pay anything like
working expenses and interest, and are
a constant charge on the revenue, and
passenger rates and freight charges are piled
up in the desperate effort to make the line a
solvent concern, until its real value is reduced
to a minimum. Also, as already mentioned,
the Fat Man who has been lavishly paid by
the country so that the country may have his
permission to improve his property for his
own sole benefit, often sells out and takes the
money out of the country, or becomes an
absentee who spends his rents in England, so
that he is an additional loss to the com-
munity. Also, rents are raised to corres-
pond with the increased value of land, so that
the country pays for the land and the railway,
and pays the annual loss on the working
of the railway, and pays high freights
in order to minimise the loss as much as
possible, and pays largely increased rents
because of the existence of the line it has
already paid for so extensively, and the Fat
Man reaps the benefit, directly or indirectly,
to the last farthing.

This is where the Betterment law comes
in. That law provides that the landholder
whose property is improved by the execution
of any public work at public expense, shall
be required to pay a considerable proportion
of the value so added towards the cost of
the work. The proportion may, with
all due consideration for the property-
owner, be put at 50 or 60 or even 70 per
cent. And if, in addition to this, the land-
tax valuation—either the valuation made for
taxation under the Local Government Act,
or the State valuation for the purposes
of the national Land-tax—with (say) 10
per cent, added, is fixed as the price
to be paid for resumption purposes,
the saving would be so large that
many lines would cost the State abso-
lutely nothing. Others would only cost
a quarter of the amount which would
be payable under the present system.
Therefore, more railways could be built, and
more work afforded, and communication
could be opened up with districts which
would otherwise remain isolated for
very many years to come. Further, these
railways could be made to yield a profit
instead of being a charge upon the revenue.
Freights could be reduced, whereby agricul-
ture would become possible in many regions
where it is now practically hopeless, and
population would thereby be increased, and
increased population would mean more
revenue and less anguish to the harassed
Government. Also, instead of a few Fat
Men each making a, huge profit, the increase
of construction would lead to many Fat Men
making a small profit apiece. The now
departure would be a boon to the landless
classes in districts where railways do not yet
exist ; to the unemployed f to the com-
mercial classes ; to the whole body of tax-
payers ; and also to the remote Fat Man,
whose prospects of railway communication,
under the present expensive conditions, are
exceedingly small. And it would be a loss
only to the adjacent Fat Man, who has a
reasonable prospect of speedily getting his
railway in any case.
# • »
Yet even the adjacent Fat Man, could he
only see it, would often be a gainer in the
end by the Betterment principle! The
results of the proposed system would be
cheap railways, low fares and freights, and
consequent prosperity in districts which are
now stagnant, and which will remain stag-
nant even if they get means of communica-
tion under the present system, because the
high cost of transit—the natural result of the
high cost of construction—will make farming
almost impracticable. This prosperity means
a steady and continuous increase of land-
values. And even if the State took a'l the
increased value which immediately resulted
from the construction of a newline, the after
increase, caused by the growth of popula-
tion, would still remain to the landlord
—until the vicious system of private
land-ownership is abolished. It is to the
direct profit of banks, finance. companies,
mortgagees, and at least 50 per cent, of Fat
Men generally, to help along the Betterment
law—to do it, not out of patriotism, but
solely in their own mean, sordid interests.
But the inherent Conservatism of the capi-
talist, and his dread of anything in the shape
of innovation, and his immoveable convic-
tion that whatever is for the benefit of the
masses must inevitably be to his detriment,
prevent him seeing this sufiiciently-obvious
fact.
* * *
The text of this discourse is the recent
action of the New South Wales Parliament
in the matter of the Narrabri-Moree Railway
Bill. The first clause of that Bill—which
clause was also intended to appear in every
other measure of a similar character—pro-
vided that the work was not to be com-
menced until the Betterment principle was in
force, and that it was to be effected under
that principle or not at all. If all such bills
were passed with a similar proviso, there
would presently arise in the country a
clamor which would have carried the new
law even through the obstructive Legislative
Council. The knowledge, in a dozen differ-
ent districts, that the coveted railway could
only be secured when a Betterment Act had
been placed on the Statute-book, would have
educated the people to a knowledge of the
meaning of the proposed reform, and
aroused them from their present lament-
able indifference. But the unemployed
were demanding work, and the Labor-party
was supporting them, and the Narrabri-
Moree district wanted its railway, and the
local Fat Man was pressing, so Minister
Young moved that the clause be expunged,
and the Assembly lacked even the energy to
divide upon the question. The Narrabri-
Moree railway is to be built upon the old
ruinous system. So is the Jerilderie-Ber-
rigan line, and probably many others. The
reasons assigned were mostly to the effect
that a new departure was “inopportune”
at the present moment-all areat reforms
are inopportune—and that, seeing that all
other lines had been built on the old
system by which the Fat Man annexed
the profits, it would be unjust to dis-
criminate against the Fat Man in this
particular instance. Which is an equally
good reason why every iniquity should con-
tinue indefinitely, and a proof that no re-
form should be attempted unless it already
exists.
« « *
New South Wales, by the way, has what
it calls a Betterment law already in exist-
ence. It was passed a year or two ago,
and is a wonderful sample of how a body of
allegedly sane legislators can seize upon a
simple principle and muddle it up with a
horrible and perverted ingenuity until it
becomes utterly useless. That law provides
that where portion of an estate is resumed
for railway purposes the owner shall get
the value of the resumed portion, Jess a
certain deduction in consideration of the
additional value conferred on the remainder
of the property. Thus the man whose land
is actually invaded by a new line is ordered
to contribute towards its cost, while 40 or 50
or 100 other men, who benefit equally with
him, pay nothing. But even the one man
who is supposed to pay really contributes
very little. The law provides no standard of
valuation, so that his claim against the State
has to be decided by a jury in the good old
way. And the blind and idiotic jurymen,
who always decide against the Government in
such cases and then complain of what they
call Government extravagance, generally
sympathise with the property-owner who
comes under the operation of” the so-called
Betterment Act, and give him all the larger
verdict. Therefore, the Act is useful chiefly
as an incentive to more violent litigation, and
otherwise it is merely a legislative curiosity.
How the N.S.W. Parliament contrived to
build so much complicated foolishness round
so simple a matter is a question which is never
likely to be answered. Its action is a whole
essay on the art of not doing it, and on the
mystery of finding a wrong way when the
right way is twenty times easier and more
apparent. The Bulletin views with a cer-
tain respect and admiration those legislators
who fount! out the wrong way in the present
instance ; their action evidences so much
perverted ingenuity and such a capacity for
inventing new forms of crookedness that they
almost deserve respect.
The Great Lawyers’ Conspiracy.
The agitation for the appointment of an Aus-
tralian Judge to the Judicial Committee of the
British Privy Council is wholly secret and sub-
terranean. Such an appointment has been
advocated by no Australian statesman, debated
by no Australian Parliament, demanded by no
utterance of Australian public opinion. Only
at rare intervals does some surface disturbance
give hint of the miners who are burrowing
underground with a view to blowing sky-high
a bastion of the fortress'of Democracy. A
letter of a New {South Wa'tw Leg. Councillor in
London Times— a Times leader—a leader in
S.M. Herald (to which Judges occasionally
contribute—a lawyer’s motion at the Tory and
unrepresentative Federal Council—these are
the only signs the community has had, beyond
vague mntterings and grumblings, of the trap
that has been set for it. And now we read
that the conspiracy is so far advanced that
Premier Rosebery will shortly move in the
Commons that “certain colonial Judges” be
translated. The plotters were sure of Rose-
bery’s alliance from the outset. He is a warm
Imperial Federationist, and he doubtless
sees, as The Bulletin sees, that the plot’s
success can only result in -binding Austra-
lasia, and Canada, and other of Great
Britain’s connections, in firmer bonds of servi-
tude. His adhesion is further significant
evidence, were further evidence required, that
there exists a coalition between place-hunting
“ colonial ” lawyers and far-seeing Imperialist
politicians to secure their respective interests
at the expense of the common democratic enemy.
♦ ♦ * «
It cannot be doubted that Premier Rose-
bery’s announcement is made with the con-
currence of some, at least, of the Australasian
Cabinets. Certainly the Queensland Ministry,
probably the Ministries of New South Wales and
Victoria, possibly those of South Australia,
Westralia and Tasmania, have guaranteed
conditional support. The lawyer influence is
dominant throughout the group ; and, in spite
of the disapproval of some highly-placed mem-
bers of the fraternity, there is no doubt
professional sentiment as- a whole would
enthusiastically welcome the creation of more
well-paid offices and the chance of fresh promo-
tion. The Q. Ministry, which commands a
slavish and unquestioning majority, and has at
hand the Australian Judge most eligible for
transfer to the Privy Council, may be relied
upon to take the first step. Attorney-General
Byrnes —who (probably by pre-arrangement
with the English Imperialist faction) moved the
Federal Council to request the British Govern-
ment to take action, and thus gave, in the
eyes of the British public (ignorant that the
proceedings of the Federal Council are laughed
at in Australia as mere excuses for an annual
picnic of ludicrous inutility) the official and
quasi-representative basis for Premier Rose-
bery’s Bill —is young and active, and has
his future to provide for. Chief - Justice
Griffith is very well in his own way, but he is
much better out of Attorney-General Byrnes’
way. Premier Reid, also a lawyer, will wait
to see how the cat jumps; but the chances are
that, aided by Attorney-General Want, he will
not prove averse to backing Byrnes. Premier
Turner (a lawyer) and Premier Kingston (also
a lawyer) are doubtful quantities, but, if
sufficient influence is brought to bear upon
them, they will probably follow Rosebery’s
lead ; and the Imperially-bebaubled Premiers
Forrest and Braddon will cordially agree to
anything.
* # «
Possibly an attempt will be made to bring
the Australian provinces into line before
the Commons deals with the matter ; but it ;s
likely the procedure will be that followed in tl e
case of the iniquitous Naval Defence Act. If
the Commons passes the measure, as it pro-
bably will do if no appeal to the British
pocket is involved, the Australian provinces
will be told that it is their fluty to give
assent, and all the resources of backstairs
diplomacy will be brought to bear upon weak-
kneed M.’sP. until success is attained. The
weak democratic spot is unquestionably Queens-
land—with a powerful and unscrupulous Minis-
try, an aimless and leaderless Opposition, a
strong candidate for the Judicial Committee,
and a horde of Parliamentary lawyers tumbling
over one another in their eagerness for booty.
If judicial jealousies be but assuaged, and some-
thing in the nature of formal approval (with or
without a direct money-vote) obtained from the
other provinces, Byrnes, Griffith, and Rose-
bery (ii/nobiliores priores) may consider the
little job done.
* * •
This, The Bulletin imagines, is something
like the programme which the conspirators have
sketched out. It is a programme whose per-
formance every Australian, every democrat,
should bitterly oppose. Not a single valid
argument in favor of the appointment of an
Australian Judge to the Judicial Committee
in Loudon, has been or can be alleged. The argu-
ments against such an appointment, as iterated
and reiterated in this paper, are crushing and
conclusive. There is no public desire for it, no
public need for it. The agitation is merely the
agitation of a few political lawyers, seeking
self-advancement unobtainable in this limited
sphere. The real reason for the agitation is
simply the ambition of certain of these lawyers
to secure a well-paid and influential position in
England, with the prospect of a title or a
higher title ; and the ambition of the remainder
to step into the vacancies thus to be left in
Australia. The ostensible reason for the agita-
tion is that the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council does not dispense good lasv to Austral-
asian appellants, because it is too far away
from the scene to which its judgments apply.
An Australian Judge, it is urged, will supply
the necessary local knowledge. Replying to
this pretext, it is denied, in the first place, by
several prominent lawyers—including Barton,
Q.C., and Pilcher, Q.C., of N.S. W.—-that the
alleged disability exists; or, if it does exist,
that the appointment of an Australian Judge is
calculated to remove it; or that, with all its
faults, the Judicial Committee is as faulty as
the Australian Supreme Courts from which
its schoolmasters are to be drawn.
* * *
In the second place, if the Judicial Com-
mittee is, as alleged, incompetent to decide Aus-
tralian cases, because it is out of touch with
Australian conditions, the obvious remedy is
not to appoint to the committee an Australian
Judge—whose grasp of Australian conditions
will grow less from the instant he leaves our
shores, while every successive year puts him
more and more out of touch with us—but


to abolish the incompetent tribunal, and to
establish a final appellate Court in Australia it-
self. If the Australian Judge is to be the
essence of Privy Council justice, why should
he go to England to dispense that justice ? If the
Australian Judge is not to be the essence of Privy
Council justice, why should he go to England to
discharge non-essential duties? In truth and
in fact, the system of sending Australian suits
bo the other end of the earth for decision is so
monstrously irrational that, did custom not
make it familiar, people would not for
one moment endure it. And now, because,
as is alleged, the-irrationality has borne fruit
in injustice, it is proposed to pile Pelion upon
Ossa, and make the monstrosity more mon-
strous still 1
# * *
The assertion that the Australian community
is incapable of administering its own justice
within its own borders involves the assertion
that it is incapable of exercising any other
equivalent function. If it lias not the capacity
to settle its own disputes in its own Courts of
law, it certainly has not the capacity to make
the laws which it is disqualified from interpret-
er. But its self-governing ability, within
local limits, is unquestioned. It is, therefore,
argued that a country is fit to legislate, and
unfit to administer its own legislation —a
palpable rectaclio ad absurdnm . And it is when
the Federal Commonwealth is close upon us
that this absurdity asks support and counten-
ance. The Commonwealth, as all sensible
Federationists agree, ■ must be self-balanced,
self-guided, in itself complete. Assuredly it
will be com.pei.ent to interpret the laws it
mikes ; and Privy Council interference will be
even more stupid and less tolerable than at pre-
sent. On .the eve, then, of Federation, it is
proposed to erect another of the stumbling-
blocks which Federation is wanted to remove !
For the appointment of an Australian Judge to
the Judicial Committee, however intrinsically
foolish, will unquestionably give that Commit-
tee some appearance of a representative charac-
ter which it has not at present, and will
strengthen the Imperialist party to demand
that the appeal to England be retained even
after Federation.
• # *
1 And this, in the third place, is a prime and
decisive reason why every Australian who
wishes to see his country no dependency
tethered to England’s apron-string, but the
home of an independent, if allied, nation, should
meet mine with counter-mine, sinuous attack
with strenuous defence, and spare no pains to
baffle the enemy in Britain and the traitors in
his own camp. The British character has
many estimable sides, and many that are
odious. The side that has always been turned to
Australia is an incarnation of calculating selfish-
ness. The modern John Bull regards the
world as his oyster, and has never failed to he
indignant when the oyster declined admission
to his greedy gullet. He truckles to the strong
and bullies the weak; sends ambassadors to
RnssiaandarmiestoEgypt; everywhere grasping
a'l and giving nothing in return. His idea of a
fair exchange is to traffic with a savage tribe
for its kingdom on earth in return for a share of
his peculiar kingdom in heaven, and he preaches
—nauseous hypocrite ! —the gospel of peace
while shedding blood like water. His idea of
an ally is somebody to squeeze ; of an enemy,
somebody who refuses to he squeezed. He
squeezed India till it rebelled, when he
quenched the rebellion in blood, and squeezed
harder. He squeezed his American children
till they revolted : then he turned his attention
to Australia. We owe him convicts, institu-
tions, and some 400 millions sterling—at as
much as he can squeeze per cent. When Aus-
tralians began to show resentment at being
squeezed, except indirectly, he sheered off', and
is now busy squeezing South Africa with the
aid of his Christian principles and the Maxim
gun. ✓
* • »
But the more thoughtful of his representa-
tives begin to see that, while the squeezing is
essential to England’s greatness, the system
needs remodelling. Professor Seeley pro-
phesied that, in a few years, Britain will fall
to the rank of a second-rate power, dwarfed by
Russia on the one hand and America on the other,
unless—unless she can achieve Imperial Fede-
ration. Imperial Federation is simply a more
methodical kind of squeezing, with voluntary
instead of involuntary victims. As arranged,
Australasia, Canada, South Africa, India, and
the British possessions in Asia and elsewhere,
are to be annually drained of their blood and
treasure for the maintenance of “the Empire”
—that is to say, of a web of sticky intrigue
with a gorged British spider in the centre.
Their young vitality is to he sapped to keep
alive the rotten old trunk. Their higher
aspirations are to be restricted to the old
commercial standard. Their profit, their
wishes, their convenience, are to be every-
where and at all times subordinate to
British profit, wishes, convenience. And, in
return for this, they get—first, last, and con-
tinually—glory, the glory of being integral
chunks of that Empire upon which the sun
never sets ; the glory of living under the flag
which has braved, &c. ; the glory of being heirs
to the sordid, greasy traditions of Manchester
and Brummagem.
• • *
Australian disgust at such a prospect has long
been sufficiently patent to make the schemers
proceed warily. They have never forgotten
the lesson taught by the United States of
America ; and they catch their flies to-day with
honey, not vinegar. Hence the distribution of
birthday dishonors ; the eagerness to lime such
foolish birds as the ex-Repuhlican Dibbs ; the
alternating cajolery and pressure brought to
hear upon influential Australians, with the
object of making our foes those of our own
household. A thousand secret strings are being
continually pulled in order that, inch by inch, a
position of Imperialist vantage may be
gained which the rising flood of Aus-
tralian Democracy will find it difficult
or (it is hoped) impossible to assail. The
Bulletin has small fear of the issue; yet a
lion may be caught in a net. Wherever, there-
fore, the meshes are visible- as in this agitation
for the appointment f an Australian Judge to
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council —
the people and Parliaments should speak with
no uncertain voice. Let us decline at once and
always to take even the smallest step which
may help to merge a humiliating connection
a disastrous servitude.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Hudson Bros.’ Strike.
So far, Hudson Bros., of Sydney, have not found
artisans willing to replace those out on strike.
The man, in fact, who accepts the heavily-reduced
wages offered, in cutting the throats of his
fellows, helps to cut his own. Sooner or later,
the curse of low wages comes home to every
household. Sooner or later, the benefit of high
wages is shared by every individual in the com-
munity. “ Where wages are highest,” says
Henry George, with eloquent truth, “there
will be the largest production and the -most
equitable distribution of wealth. There will
invention be most active, and the brain guide
best the hand. There will be the greatest com-
fort, the widest diffusion of knowledge, the
purest morals, and the truest patriotism.”
Hudson Bros.’ late employes are fighting the
battle of the whole country, and it is well
that their fellows are seized with the import-
ance of the principle for which they con-
tend. Their opponents assert that wages
must find their “natural level” i.e.,
the level of starvation, the level at
which it is just possible for a man to live and
labor and not die. The answer is, first, a
denial that this level is “natural” anymore
than the level of comfort, the level which per-
mits an intelligent human being to get some
pleasure out of life in return for his toil. All
tendencies, all states, are “ natural,” and one is
neither more nor less “ artificial” or “ natural ”
than another. The only condition of “ natural-
ness ” is existence: it is just as natural for a
community to live on a high plane of existence
as on a low one —provided it does exist. And,
secondly, it is possible for the Australian com-
munity to deliberately raise itself from the
slough of unrestricted competition. This is
only a theory till it is proven ; but, proven or
not, it has just as much weight as an opposing
theory. Proof can only be found, or found
wanting, by experiment ; and, considering
the issues involved, it is certainly the
duty of the community to make the experiment.
With a virgin country, resources practically
unlimited, and a population whose character
compares well with that of any population in
the world, it is in the power of Australia, The
Bulletin believes, to become a home for many
millions of happy, independent families, with
well-paid employment for every worker, and
poverty a rare incident adequately provided for.
Qiie means to such an end is the absolute pro-
tection of the community from the competition
of cheap laborers or the products of cheap
labor. The restriction of immigration is a
necessary corollary : the limitation of the birth-
rate, if a contingency, is a contingency of the
far remote future. Another means to the end is
the transference of population from cities to the
country, from secondary industries to primary
industries, from industries which create luxu-
ries to those which create necessaries, from
industries which involve the payment and
receipt of wages to industries in which all or
nearly all those employed are self-sufficing pro-
ducers, enjoying the direct fruit of their own
labor. A third means to the end is for the
community, in its collective capacity as em-
ployer, to pay wages which permit its employes
to live in decent comfort, and to take care that
those who contract for its supplies also pay
such wages. Hudson Bros, are large con-
tractors for the N.S.W. Government, and if
they are permitted to reduce still further the
already reduced wages which they pay, other
contractors must follow suit, and the standard of
living of the whole community must fall another
notch to correspond. Indignant shareholders,
trampling on the turning worm, suggest that
Hudson Bros’, works be closed as P. N. Russell
and Co.’s were closed many years ago. The
men are willing. The firm’s capital will be
wiped out of existence, hut there will he only a
temporary loss of employment. The firm’s
contracts will still have to he executed : other
firms will step in to fill the place which it has
filled, and will employ a correspondingly
increased amount of capital. There will be
individual cases of hardship ; but the men are
content to risk that. If Hudson Bros.’ indus-
try disappears from the face of the earth
to-morrow morning, there will be just as much
need to-morrow evening for the workers whom
it employs. It is simply a question of a little
trouble in adjusting pegs to holes. In the
strength of devotion to a high patriotic prin-
ciple, the men can face that prospect with
equanimity.
The Vic. .Public Lands Muddle.
The Victorian Government is beginning to
think hard about the necessity for a reform of
the local Lauds Department. Victoria pos-
sesses the most fearful and wonderful laud
system in Australasia. The man who wants to
take up a selection in that province has first to
skirmish round and find a piece of suitable
soil. The department doesn’t profess to supply
information on this or any other subject;
instead, the applicant has to furnish informa-
tion to the department. Having found the
land, he has probably to persuade the depart-
ment to have it gazetted as available. When
it is gazetted there are, in most cases, a dozen
applicants, and the original discoverer has to
take lus chance with the rest. Each applicant
has to send in £1 with his application. When
one man has been selected by ballot, or because
he has a larger family than the rest, or
because he knows somebody in the department,
the local land hoard “ recommends ” him to a
board in Melbourne, and the hoard in Mel-
bourne takes weeks, or even months, to think
over the matter. When it also approves, the
selector is required to pay £4 survey
fee. Then he has to wait until the
surveyor comes along, which is some-
times in six months or so. When he does'
come, and makes the survey, and sends in his
report after he is fully rested, the office spends
weary weeks or months in preparing the lease.
Then £1 has to be paid for the lease, also the
first half-year’s instalment has to be handed
over in advance. When the original deposit is
paid there is a delay till the Treasury notifies
the Lands Department that it has got the
money. When the survey fee is paid there is
another protracted hiatus until the Treasury
notifies the Lands that it has received that
money also. And when the £1 for the lease,
and the first half-year’s instalment are forth-
coming, there is a third weary interval, until
the Treasury again “ notifies ” in the same
fashion. When all these notifications are
attended to, the applicant is called upon, after
some delay, to attend at the office and sign
certain necessary documents. He has next to
wait until the Governor gets hack from where-
ever he may happen to be, and appends his
signature to the documents ; and then, after
some more delay, the papers are sent to
some department to-be registered, and when
this has been done, they are gradually
sent back to the Lands Department, and
the Lands, in the fullness of time, tells the
applicant to call and get them. The process
takes about 12 or 15 months, and when it is
quite finished the selector may go and take
possession of his land. As the natural result of
all this circumlocution the remaining public
lands of Victoria are nob being selected ; the
Victorian farmer is drifting over the border
into Riverina, simply because, when he wants
to select, he can’t afford to spend 15 months or
so in the process; and though the Victorian
land-revenue is now only £445,000, it costs
about £lBO,OOO to manage the department, or
just about twice as much, in proportion to re-
ceipts, as in Hew South Wales. In fact,
matters are now in such a condition that it is
almost an open question whether it wouldn’t he
cheaper, so far as actual cash is concerned, to
close up the Lands Office, and let every man
keep his selection or his grazing lease just as it
stands, and let the remaining public lands be
rushed by anybody who wants them, the big-
gest man to take the property where any con-
flict arises, and to keep it till a still larger in-
dividual comes along and fires him out.
«.
The only newspaper in Australia, so far as The
Bulletin is aware, that has had one single
word to say, either directly or inferentially, in
defence of the outrageous conduct of Mr.
Justice Windeyer in the Dean poisoning case,
is the alvvays+sneaking S. M. Herald. Two of
the Melbourne dailies—including the Argus,
than which there can surely be, in Australia,
no paper less addicted to impugning judicial
methods, found a parallel for the action of
Judge Windeyer with respect to Dean, in
that of the eminent Mr. Justice Jeffreys at
the trial of Alice Lisle at Winchester Assizes.
“It is remarkable,” says the Argus, “that
Macaulay’s words, describing Jeffreys’ con-
duct at the trial of Alice Lisle, exactly fit the
present case : ‘ The jury retired and remained
long in consultation. The Judge grew impatient.
He could not conceive, he said, how in so plain a
case they should ever have left the box. He
sent a messenger to tell them that if they did
not instantly return he would adjourn the
Court, and lock them up all night. Thus put
to the torture, they came, hut came to say they
doubted whether the charge had been made out.’
The Sydney jury made a recommendation to
mercy on account of the prisoner’s youth and
previous good character, and Mr. Justice Win-
deyer was softened to this extent, that he
undertook to send it to the Executive, with his
own opinion endorsed upon it, after which the
prisoner was told to repent as quickly as pos-
sible of the horrible crime he had committed.”
By the way, it is not quite clear from the news-
paper reports whether Mr. Windeyer said he
would “ endorse ” the jury’s recommendation to
mercy or whether he merely promised to
“endorse it with his own opinion”—which
would be quite a different thing.
Arguing from history, the most probable end
of the Dean poisoning-case will be that the
death-sentence will be commuted to a longterm
of peual servitude, and that public excitement,
having then died out, Dean will be left to rot
in prison. Almost every weak-kneed Ministry
takes refuge in this same old compromise under
such circumstances as the present, and the
emotional, unreasoning, semi-hysterical com-
munity generally accepts the compromise with-
out seriously considering the wickedness
and supreme foolishness which it involves.
The circumstances of the case can be put
in a few words. If Dean’s guilt was
proved, then, so long as the present
law exists in New South Wales, it is the duty
of those who administer the law, and who de-
clare their belief in its justice by leaving it on
the Statute Book, to hang him. If it wasn’t
proved according to the letter and spirit
of the law, then lie is entitled to release.
And, altogether apart from the question
of his guilt or innocence, the Government
should seriously consider whether it is safe to
allow any Judge addicted to treating juries as
the Dean jury was treated, to remain on the
judicial bench. If there is not sufficient evi-
dence on which to hang Dean under the exist-
ing law, then there isn’t sufficient evidence to
justify Ins imprisonment for even 24 hours. The
crime, if legally proved against him, presents
not one redeeming feature to justify a commu-
tation of the sentence, and if the death-sentence
is commuted to a term of imprisonment it can
only be because the Executive doesn’t believe
in the justice of that death-sentence. And, in
that case, the Executive is sentencing to long
imprisonment a man whom it thinks maybe inno-
cent! The Reid Government has been, all its
days—-in other matters, anyhow—a Government
of compromises, and its main object has been to
shirk responsibility. Just now it is face to face
with a responsibility which it cannot shirk. It
must either hang Dean in defiance of sober public
opinion, or release him and thereby openly record
its opinion that his trial was (as more than one
other modern N.S.W, trial has been) a disgrace
to the forms of justice ; or, take a middle course
by commuting his sentence, and thereby demon-
strate, either that it dare not carry out the law
against what it believes to he a guilty man, or
that it is cruel enough to send a man whom it
knows has nob been fairly tried to the living
death of penal servitude, rather than face the
cutting of aG< r ian-knot. Many Governments
similarly situated have taken the middle course,
and may the Lord have mercy on their souls.
The present Government is hereby invited to
take the opportunity of making a new de-
parture and oi g straight.
It is generally understood that the Reid
(N.S.W.) Ministry wants ex-Treasurer
M‘ Mill an to represent Australia in the foith-
corning monetary conference. The object of the
conference is to arrive, if possible, at some
decision re the silver problem, and to discuss
bi-metallism and the weary old “ meejum of
exchange.” Australia is a silver-producing as
well as a gold-producing country, and its own
interests are probably—though the point is
not certain—in the direction of bi-metallism—
while its silver supply holds out, any-
how. Britain’s interests are wholly in
the direction of retaining gold as the only
standard. M'Millan is purely British ; he
represents a British firm in Australia ; and he
is an aggressive monometallist, like most
Britons—therefore, M'Millan, as the repre-
sentative of Australia, is a mockery. And,
in any case, as Australia has hardly even
begun to intelligently consider the metallic
problem, and doesn’t know in which in-
terest it wants to be represented, its repre-
sentation, either by M‘Millan or anybody
else, is a mockery. What instructions is it pro-
posed that M‘Millan is to receive; and by whose
authority is he to receive these instructions,
whatever they may be ; and from whom is he
to get them; or is he to have no instructions at
all, but simply to commit the country to any-
thing that may suit his prejudices or his per-
sonal interests? Also, is it quite certain that
there is any such person as M ‘Millan, or is he
only a shadow cast by the partial eclipse of
Parkes ?
—♦
Financial item for the consideration of Aus-
tralian Treasurers :
In the Island of Guernsey, some years ago, a imrkct-
p’aoe was much wanted, and the Government of the
island having determined to build it, issued notes, in-
scribed, “ Guernsey Market Notes,” for £1 each, and
numbered from one to 4000, £4OOO being the estimated
cost < f the market. With these notes the Government
paid the contractor, the contractor paid his men, and the
men bought all the necessaries they required, as thenoUs
were a legal tinder in the island. They wire used to
pay rent, to pay taxes, and for all other purposes, When
the market was finished it immediately produced a
revenue, and this revenue was applied to redeem the
notes; and in ten years all wire redeemed, and hence-
forth to the present time the market returns a considerable
revenue to the Government of the island, which goes tQ
reduce taxation ; and all this was done without borrowing
any money or paying any interest.
The Bulletin keeps on wanting to know why
some Australian Government doesn’t raise
£],000,000 in this way for railway building
purposes —if constructed on the betterment
principle that amount would build 1000 miles
of line, or possibly 2000 miles in any mode-
rately accessible country —and then devote
the revenue from these lines, after paying
working expenses, to building more lines, and
so on. If honestly managed, and with a reason-
able amount of brains, £1,000,000 raised in this
way would ultimately enable all the rest of the
railways in any province to be constructed
without borrowing another copper from now
till the end of history.
The Marquis of Queensberry is by nature a pro-
testing person. He gets excited, arid has been
regarded with much scorn by a mean, discreet,
sneering “ society.” When Tennyson’s play,
“The Promise of May,” was first performed in
a London theatre, poor Queensberry rose up
among the stalls and protested against what he
called the play’s travesty of atheism. Any
social or political question that happened to be
booming was bound to fetch a well-worded pro-
test from the somewhat deranged Marquis.
When he objected to this, that or the other
matter, Queensberry took care to let every-,
body know it, therefore the respectable people,
who neither encourage nor resent anything (ex-
cept taxes and democracy) with a ha’porth of
enthusiasm, felt quite certain that he was a more
or less dangerous crank. The other day
Queensberry protested against Oscar Wilde,
at considerable risk to himself. All the en-
couragement he received from “society” may
he guessed from the bare fact that his fashion-
able lawyer parted company with him at an
early stage of the proceedings. Society made
the remark, no doubt, that he would richly
deserve punishment for his vulgar folly. To-day
Oscar Wilde is in prison, whilst Queens-
berry figures as a public benefactor.
Other aristocratic fathers must have sus-
pected the alleged Gomorrah culturist of
corrupting their sons, but they were cool-
headed parents, not cranks, and they didn’t
protest. Worldly-wise men never mix them-
selves up with scandals, violent reforms,
or unpleasantnesses of any description. To
be useful you must be a little bit ridiculous
and “objectionable” always. There are. 99
chances to one in favor of your living and dying
despised for your pains, but no matter. As a
rule, it is quite as honorable to get expelled from
the meeting for making yourself unpleasant
as to sit in the chair and receive a hearty
vote of thanks.
The Argus city editor takes up a very old
Bulletin parable:—
Mr. Elder, the chairman of the Union Trustee Co.
advocates the issue by the Vic. Govt, of a local 3J per
cent, loan of £500,000, the proceeds to be devoted to the
extinguishment of a similar amount in London. The
effect of such an operation would be to transfer so much
indebtednes from the United Kingdom to the colony. The
proposal is sagacious and statesmanlike. The burdi noi
our public indebtedness consists principally in the interest
being payable abroad instead of at home. Unpopular at
the idea may be, our grievous fault has consisted in bor-
rowing too freely abroad and too little at home. Th«
retention of the interest on a public debt in thecountrj
is a far different matter from its remittance across the
seas. We think, therefore, with Mr. Elder, that advan
tage should be taken of the present extremely favorable
opportunity to transfer as much of our public indebted-
ness to the colony itself as possible. If we had the yearly
interest of some £2,000,000 to circulate at home our post
tion would be tar different from what it now is.
Some day Editor Haddon will read the com
mercial column of his paper, and then the city
editor will he bowled out. “ Australia for the
Australians ” is a very wicked motto —in the
Argus.

P a st° r Hnweis, of London, the Most-
I ravelled Smythe’s latest lion, roared for the first
tune, at Sydney School of Arts, on Thursday
night. Ihe public doesn’t expect much from the
average parson, and it got even less than it ex-
pected f rom Talmage. It got much more than it
expected from Havveis. The new expounder is a
very,old-looking with a triangular bald spot
on Ins ftjrelitiad, and a face like Dot .Boucicault/s—
-as it will be 35 years hence. Also, his voice and
mannerisms suggest “ Hans the Boatman’s ’’
grandfather, in a good state of preservation. His
legs are much older than his head, and he dodders
about the stage in a curious fashion, and abstrac-
tedly shifts the furniture from place to place in
the heat of his argument. When he makes an un-
obtrusive joke, he drops his weary, flabby eye-lids
over lus piercing eyes, and utters it with the air of
a man whose thoughts are far away; when he
makes an aggressive joke, he bobs his head, hands,
feet and coat-tails all together, by way of emphasis.
His jukes are. painfully inferior, by the way, bub
they haven t the air of laborious preparation
which characterised Talmage’s. Mr. Haweis is a
hard and conscientious traveller, and covers several
miles of stage at a jog-trot in the course of his 90
minutes oration.
• * *
subject of the opening lecture was
Music and Morals." Mr. Haweis is a musical
crank of vast enthusiasm, and though his playing
is wholly execrable his theoretical knowledge of
the subject is evidently immense. Unlike the
brassy preacher from Brooklyn, who had nothing
to tell and told it in a series of -painful shrieks,
Jlaweis has more to say than he can compress into
the available time, and he tells it with great
velocity. He lias a good voice and a bumpy
delivery, which breaks up at times and tails olf
into muttenngs and interjections and gibberish.
I his is generally at the end of a sentence, when
be has so many statements to make at once that
he stops from congestion of language, and finishes
on by waving himself round his own head in a
general sort of way. But withal, Mr. Haweis is
obviously a man with much brains and a vast fund
of interesting information, and is a liberal-minded
parson, and not much of a parson at that, with an
intelligent craze for art which will make him very
acceptable to the intelligent classes. The unin-
telligent classes were represented on Thursday by
a poor, hairy man who rose up and stated that
there were 1,000,000 people out of work, and
asked what the aged pastor did with his money.
Owing to the astonished and petrified condition of
the ‘ ohneker-ont, ’’ this poor fellow was not got rid
of until he had fired olf his conundrum twice over.

Oscar Wilde, who has, so far, been unable
to obtain bail, was represented at Sydney Lyceum
on Saturday by his second-oldest play “An Ideal
Husband.” This effort of the lily-apostle was
patronised by a very large audience, yet not one of
the crowd had energy enough to call for the
author, and bring Dion Boucicault out to explain
that that person was unavoidably detained in a
large building. “An Ideal Husband” is plea-
santer in tone than “Lady Windermere’s Fan ”
though possibly a shade less brilliant. The bored
elderly-young men, who pervaded the latter piece
and uttered diseased cynicisms and ancient tish-
I ike apophthegms among the high-priced furniture
are mostly dead by this time, or absent through
hypochondna or corrugated liver or the scarcity
of bail; and there is now only one elderly-young
man, and his cynicism isn’t so oppressively gamey
as that of the former lot. Moreover, he is in love
with a real flesh-and-blood girl, which makes a
healthier atmosphere about him than the flavour
of mental decayed prawn which surrounded the
previous batch. Oscar Wilde put his first and best
collection of epigrams in “ Lady Windermere ’’
but those he now produces are a good second-best.
As for plot, the “ Ideal Husband ” has next to
n .°l ie - A ,. ri .°h and enormously good baronet and
rising politician has a wife even more pure and
b-autiful than himself. Then, like the horrible
awakening of the man who is to be hanged at 8
o clock, there comes on the scene an adventuress
with splendid hair, and documents to prove that
he made his first rise by selling Cabinet secrets
to a German speculator. She demands as the
once of secresy his assistance in a particularly
shady and dangerous spec. The rest of the play
consists mostly of the vacillations of the white-
washed political sepulchre, and his wife’s wretched-
ness ; until in the third act the cynical, elderly-
young man bowls out the adventuress and peace is
restored. The whitewashed sepulchre—who seems
a tolerably deserving sepulchre, after all—then
goes on as if nothing had happened. This is all
the plot; the rest is epigram and the soul-wail of
Oscar Wilde.
• # «
Miss Geraldine Olliffe, as the adventuress,
more than confirms the excellent impression she
left behind her in the “Masqueraders.” She is
stately, fair to look upon, and graceful, and she
makes every point which her part contains. Miss
Faber, as the saintly wife of the whited sepulchre
is also an unqualified success; and the sepulchre
himself, in the person of Titheradge, is in every
way satisfactory. Miss Noble has gone back to
her old role of the ingenue, but this time die
.ngdnue is an original little maiden with many
clever things to say, and there is no touch of
insipidity about her. Boucicault, Ward, and a
few other people fill the remaining parts with their
usual success. The play is sufficiently healthy in
its tone ; the furniture is perfect; Oscar Wilde’s
second-best dialogue is far above the best of most
playwrights ; and even the absence of incident
doesn t matter ranch—the piece gets on well
enough without it. Altogether, “An Ideal Hus-
band ” merits better luck than to come in at the
fag-end of the season, and the author deserved a
longer start of the police than he got.
** * *
The Tivoli picked up a good share of the
business that was going during the recent muddy
and draggled holiday season. The bucolic person
with grass-seeds in his hair, also his wife and 11
children, all approve strongly of the variety busi-
ness, and many horny hands and large feet joined
in the applause, and the voice and boots of Sarah
from the back-blocks were lifted in commenda-
tion. Larry Dooley has shaken down to his new
sphereof usefulness at the Tivoli, and sweet Marie
Lnella has proved a great attraction. Miss Syria
Lamont, a sweet vocalist with a well-trained
soprano warble, also promises well.
** * *
Concerning “Little Jack Sheppard” at
Sydney Royal there is nothing new to report, save
that Maggie Moore prospers exceedingly, and no
successor to Jack is announced, or seems likely to
be for some time.

The Comic Opera Co. opens at Sydney
Lyceum on Saturday with “ Paul Jones.” Nellie
Stewart is leading lady for the last time—the very
last time on this occasion—for at the end of the
season she leaves to once more try her fortunes in
May she have better luck than she had
the last time she exposed her adorable chest to the
blasts of the foggy isle!

The Fisk Jubilee singers, under the
tau nted Orpheus McAdoo, are running at Sydney
Centenary Hall—which is probably the reason
why Pastor Haweis is driven to give his unpre-
tending show at the rather aged School of Arts
premises. It is many years now since the Fisk
Jubilee amgers first struck Australia. They were
really Fisk in those day— at least, The Bulletin
presumes so. Since then they have been less and
less r isk at each succeeding appearance, and now
the old co. and the old management have wholly
vanished, the name only excepted, and they aren’t
r isk at all any longer. But the present combina-
tion sing 9 fully up to the old-time standard, and
everybody who loves sweet and plaintive music,
with no legs and no clog dance to distract atten-
tion, should patronise it.

Anew variety co., captained by Mr.
W. P. Morrison, broke out on Saturday at'the
long-deserted Sydney Opera House. There was
a large audience—which doesn’t often happen
in the Opera House nowadays—and the co.
proved to be very much like other varieties,
ireople who t «ke a serious interest in variety shows
viewed it with satisfa tion, and the general ver-
dict was favorable. Stdl, The Bulletin doubts
whether Sydney can support two minstrel enter-
tainments at once.

„ The Bulletin’s opinions on the subject of
*auat” are held over till next week. This
paper’s literary minion visited Her Majesty’s on
Monday night, but was blocked on the stairs by
the tail-end of a vast crowd, which filled all the
available standing-room, and so he gave up the
case as hopeless. The latest news concerning
haust is to the effect that it is still doing well.

The Unjust Steward” was to have been
the subject of Rev. H. R. Haweis’ sermon at St.
John s ; but R. S. Smythe told him this would
never do, as he would be treading on the corns of
a lot of people in or out of gaol. So “ The Power
of Frayer was substituted, as a subject to which
there oouid be no reasonable objection, even in
Australia.
A Gaiety Girl was produced at Mel-
bourne Princess’s on Saturday, before a mighty
collection of people who arrived with the vaguest
notions of what they were likely to see, and went
away m doubt as to whether they had been much
pleased or ratte r disappointed. Coming after
Morocco Boimd,” the new “musical comedy”
is placed at a disadvantage, inasmuch as its family
likeness to that ill-fated experiment awakens sad
memories Glderly gentlemen in frock-coats
dance and sing, and brandish the umbrella of
modern civilisation. The prima donna presents a
first appearance of being about to “do the block ”
The incongruity between fashionable apparel and
comic opera behaviour is the principal source of
humour for “A Gaiety Girl,” although a good
deal of fancy dressing is mixed with the salad.
Also, there are some dainty gleams of leg—the
chaste, retiring leg of private life—which leave,
as it were, a rich sunset glow behind them. -More-
over, a tinge of melodrama is contributed by a jeal-
ous lady sniaid who drops her lady’s diamond comb
into the pocket of a simple Gaiety girl, and ac-
cuses the poor innocent of “shaking” it, said comb
being the identical bit of evidence which was once
found on a co-respondent’s sofa. A gay old
Divorce Court Judge plays a naughty tune upon
the comb—that is to say, he makes reminiscent
remarks upon it, until the owner trembles for her
good name. The mis-accused Gaiety damsel
proves her innocence at the finish, and makes a
delicious picture in the pale light of the lime,
whilst old friend Ryley warbles his baritone love
to her. But “A Gaiety Girl ” is not generally
serious, or aggressively poetic. At heart, it is a
frisky fatce, depending fur success upon the com-
pany, No flies on the company. The perform-
ance is bright, clean, and highly finished.
* * m
Miss Decima Moore has the happiest way
of going about her business. Her singing is small
and pretty, like her dancing, and the charm of
her petite personality makes itself felt more and
more as the show progresses. Miss Palotta, with
her fetching foreign accent and gestures, obtains
° U ni encore for a ditty in the second act.
Miss Blanche Massey, as the name character, is
simply a delightful vision, but Miss Maud
Hobson, the real original Gaiety Girl, noxv plays
the lovely creature who dropped her comb on a
co-respondent’s sofa, and scores a big success.
Miss_ Madge Rossell, whose large hat doesn’t suit
her, intoxicates the audience with a solo dance.
.Later on, Miss Lucy Murray, the centrepiece in a
pas de trois, contributes the sublimest high-
kick that ever bade defiance to the Southern
Gross. Harry Monkhouse, the massive comedian,
is generally to the fore, whereas small Fred Kaye
and Louis Bradfield, the lively young man of the
piece, can only get there once in a way. Monk-
nouse is a fine, fruity humorist in splendid condi-
i appears as an amorous physician and
the Angel Decima’s papa. He isn’t a convincing
medical man, being more like a respectable levia-
than bookmaker, but under any other name he
would seem just as truly droll. In spite of his
large proportions and unctuous method, Mr.
Monkhouse is as light a comedian as any of them.
Ihe heaviest artist in the company is Charles
Kyley. He sang “ Tommy Atkins ”on Saturday
with a slow and sad utterance which, under the
circumstances, set one thinking of that recent
cremation in the midst of picnickers down at
Sandringham beach.
** * *
The Span of Life,” which The Bulletin
received with enthusiasm in Sydney, is tolerably
certain to have another.long innings in Melbourne
at the Royal. Bland Holt’s vast spectacles re-
quire all the room they can get. The Royal sup-
plies the broadest and deepest stage procurable
therefore the rolling waves, together with the bill-
locks, horses, camels, mountain ranges, and gigan-
tic villain of this melodrama are able to spread
themselves out a little further than usual, and,
altogether, “ A Span of Life’’ranks as a stupen-
dous event. When the three opportune acrobats
Jink themselves together and form a bridge of
hniinan spine across the yawning chasm for Miss
Hilda Spong’s convenience, the triumph of Bland
Holt s latest sensation is complete, and everybody
gets called before the curtain, including the acro-
bats whose bodies have been hallowed by the
heroine s footfalls. Walter Baker, as of yore,
rings the lighthouse alarm-bell, and otherwise
thwarts Cosgrove’s dark designs with great ability.
Baker really looks virtuous, in addition to assert-
ing his good qualities by dispensing with a waist-
coat. ihe noblest men of melodrama are notori-
ous for their instinctive dislike to vests
even as the heroine is known by her simple
brown fh-' 688 i n a H time of trouble. Miss

effect, likewise Mrs. Bland Holt is as welcome as
ever, or even more so. in the character of Shrove
iuesday, Bland Holt chases the Arabs on horse-
back, and supports the good young man for all he
is worth. Ihe villain Dunstan Cosgrove falls
satisfactorily into the law’s iron grip, and other
members of a well-chosen east get their deserts
after the manner of their kind.

“ Man and Woman,” at the Bijou, is a
powerful story of the sentimental clerk who bor-
rows securities from the bank’s strong-mom :.nd
drops the proceeds in rash speculation. The clerk
who makes a rise by doing the same thing is never
represented in four-act plays. No sound, moral
lesson could be drawn from a restoration of the
papers by a joyful capitalist, so the culprit always
squanders his borrowed money on the wrong
stock, and suffers agonies of shame. In this
instance, Arthur Dacre gets saved by a
chance benefactor after he has placed the
handcuffs on himself, and his marriage
with Miss Amy Roselle is a pleasure
in store when the curtain falls. “Man and
Woman ” offers opportunities to both these artists.
Individually and collectively they make the plav
very interesting. Elton (who takes a farewell
benefit on the 25ch) is not a specially important
item, and some of the other people—there are 22
mentioned in the bill—are unnecessary, or absurdly
tedious. The awful deliberation with which Diver
and Augustus Glover converse together proves
that time is no object to actors as long as they can
enjoy themselves in the centre of the stage.

Don Juau, Junior, the Luster burlesque
at the Cambridge Theatre, is fully 20 years after
date Something of the kind was considered
inirth-provoking once upon a time, when the soul
of was a slop-made pun, and bimetallism
hadn t come into notice. Nowadays a lecture „ n
the worlds gold - currency seems a sprightlier
thing chan the burlesque aforesaid. No parti ular
blame attaches to the performers. They are merely
unable to be funny in a dreary class of entertain-
ment. “Don Juan” is liberally mounted as far
as the tiny stage will permit, and a limited
orchestra plays an assortment of music-hall
melodies with the best intentions.
The first appearance in Melbourne of
Hamilton’s Circus and Water Pantomime drew a
crowded tent last Saturday. Strong man Hajek
is probably the leading feature of this circus,
judging from the awe-struck demeanour of the
multitude as he showed, them his muscle.
Ihere are, however, a number of other
features that claim to be stronger than
even Hajek, and the programme on Saturday
was so long that the card-playing pony, Sovereign,
had to be excused from taking a baud at euchre.
Hamilton's circus is not particularly hooey in
character, but Melbourne is less horsey than of
yore, so the comparative lack of noble animal is
rather gratefully noted. A particularly mudcal
orchestra deserves mention. In fact, it deserves
two mentions, for circus orchestras hitherto have
been generally more dreadful than words could
express.

A scratch orchestra, and all the usual
drawbacks incidental to benefits, afflicted Marie
■taster's show at Meib. Rq aI, hut tl e singing
was thankfully received. Young Jules Simonsen
came out quite strung as Don Ciesar and Faust,
also three amateur operatists of the male rex,
Frnest Fitts, Charles Cunningham, and George
button, were more or less successful. Fitts, who
used to be Ernest “ Blackham "on tie- concert p'at-
foim, looked and sang the part of Mephistoplieles
admirably. Little Miss Hetty Patey shaped well
as tj he contralto boy in “Maritana” (Ist Act)
and Faust” (Garden Scene), and no principal
person proved a dire calamity, with the exception
of a Lyric Club comedian, who perpetrated a
comic footman in “ Choufleuri.” A large audience
dealt mercifully with the scratch orchestra, and
416 - k um ° unst > and everything else that
wounded its feelings, because the real business
of the evening was Miss Elster’s voice in three
characters. The people had mostly come to hear
that reliable nightingale sing, and she didn't dis-
appoint them. Under more encouraging con-
ditions Miss Elster might have turned her voice
on quite full at the meter, but as it was she found
a lot of new admirers who wondered why an artist
of such promise hadn’t gone 'ome long ago.

Pinafore,” in aid of Jewish charities,
ran its two nights at Meib. Princess’s, last week
with gorgeous results. The theatre contained a
larger quantity of nose, jewellery, and embonpoint
than is ever seen there on ordinary occasions, and
the amateur performances, allowing for a little
professional assistance, were exceptionally smart,
iwo of the principals, Dr. O’Hara and Mr. “Pert
GolJms, remained in their places, as Corcoran
and Hackstraw, undisturbed, but the other billets
were open to competition. The struggle for first
honors resolved itself into a match between the
two Josephines. Miss Flegeltaub, as was ex-
pected, finished second, although, in stage experi-
ence and clear enunciation of her words, she could
give points to Miss Orelli. The clever little lady
from .Ballarat, seemed, in fact, to have gained too
much confidence as a star among novices. Her
Josephine was an up-to-date damsel, with a bright
blue satin costume, formidable black lines under
the eyes, and an artificial method of fiddle-stringy
singing, which is tasteful and effective, neverthe-
less. Miss Leonore Orelli, who was making only
her second venture on the stage, walked gracefully
through the part, and sang like a fresh young
angel. It was a very promising second appear-
ance in all respects. If this self-possessed
womanly girl makes up her mind to be a good
there" 3 an< * * s ’ nger ’ ebe w ' d probably get

Way out at North Fitzroy (Meib.), adjoin-
ing the Old Colonists* Home, and within a stone-
throw of the Merri Creek, the Dramatio and
Musical Association has its asylum for “ members
of the dramatic profession and others.” There is
nothing orthodox about the little institution, which
consists, thus far, of a couple of snug cottage build-
ings, situated wide apart, upon two acres of
ground. The smaller cottage, where an actor-
identity lives with his family, has an air of privacy
and a smart bit of flower-garden about it. The
other stands back further from the road, and bears
a stone tablet setting forth the fact that George

in 1860, and erected this, the Founder's Cottage.
10 years later. Joe Dias seems to be the show-

concerning the good points of the place and its
history, and the healthfulness and peace of the

of pensioners in general, and, although the
weekly allowance has been cut down 30 per cent,
he bears no ill-will to anybody except the banks.’
He considers it quite a mercy that the banks
dmn t burst up the D, and M. Association, and
he speaks of the land-boom with a curled lip.

It is commonly rumored that N.S. Wales is
going to float another loan, and as Premier Reid refuses
to contradict, the report it is no doubt true. It is also
rumored that it is to be floated in London, and this at a
time when the Australian banks are stuffed with gold for
which they can find no safe investment, and when money
can be had in abundance at 3J per cent., with no com-
mission, brokerage, exchange, or flotation expenses I
The raising of more loans is bad enough, but tbe raising
of more loans in London,, when the Australian market is
equally favorable, is a deed which ought to make N.S.W.
Assembly cast out the doer of it as a hopeless muddler
and an ass of the deepest dye.

The Mutual Life Association of Australia has
not done quite so well, in some respects, this year as
last; in others it has doqe rather better. The premium
income has fallen off by £4OOO, but most assurance
societies are now meeting with a similar experience, and
this is mostly owing to the general poverty of the com-
munity. The death claims have increased by nearly
£7OOO, and the amount added to the society’s funds is
only £46,000, against £55,000 in 1893. The expense
rate is about the same as last, year, when
it stood at the rather high figure of 28 per
cent, of the premiums, or 20J per cent, of the total
income. On the other hand, the interest in arrear is only
£2827, which speaks well for the condition of the invest-
ments; and the method of showing this item separately is
a good feature in the balance-sheet. It also shows
separately the “ properties acquired by foreclosure”—
another commendable proceeding. The old fashion,
common to almost all financial institutions, of giving the
public as little information as possible, was good enough
in the pre-burst period when the public took tilings on
trust; but now an office which has nothing to conceal, or
knows how to conceal under a hurst of candour, does
well to supply as many facts as possible.
The Mutual Life Association is wisely making
provision for depreciation as it goes along. It is also
founding a special reserve-fund to provide for the future
necessity of reducing its estimate of interest on invest-
ments to 3J per cent.—a 'necessity which all societies will
ha\ e to face by and bye, and for which only a few are
seriously preparing. The rate of interest lias declined,
though very slightly, and is still over 5J per cent, on the
invested funds. A bonus is to be declared Ibis year, and
will be the largest this society has yet announced—a
gratifying circumstance, considering that bankruptcies are
more common than bonuses nowadays.

Tie balance-sheet of the City of Melbourne
Bank is the sxddest document which even that sad little
inst ration has yet published. In March, ’94, it reported
a n it profit for the half-year of £5747. Next half year
its profits were only £717. This half it shows a total loss
of £19,793. The directors also report that “it is impos-
iibl i to value with any degree of accuracy ” the hank’s
lan i?d property, therefore it-has been taken at the book
valution, but when the necessiry amendment of the
Companies Act is carried out “it will be necessary to
write off a considerable amount of the capital.” This is in
add tion to the reserve fund of £200,000, which has already
vanished. As the City of Melbourne’s advances (amount-
ing to over £4,000,000) now' appear to yield an average of
only 3 per cent, per annum, so far as can be gathered
from the balance-sheet, there must he an immense
amount of dead assets, and it looks quite possible that
much of the paid-up capital (which is only £662,000) may
have to go into the bottomless gulf of “ depreciation.”
The institution has not even earned its deposit interest,,
saying nothing of working expenses. The calls in a rear
have increased in six months from £lB,OOO to i 36,000.
Cash on hand has diminished by nearly £BO,OOO. Bullion
on hand and in transit has fallen from £BO,OOO to £22,000.
Deposits have fallen off slightly, and the liabilities *n
notes have increased by £9OOO.
The City of Melbourne Bank is now appealing
to its depositors to reduce the rate of interest on recon-
structed deposits from 4J lo 3 per cent. If this scheme
is successfully carried out it will result in a saving of
about £50,000 a year. But, on the basis of the half-year
just closed, the institution is now losing nearly £40,000
a year, so that, even if there is no further falling off. the
new arrangement will leave very little margin of profit.
Of late, however, each half-year has shown a very large
falling-off compared with its predecessor, and unless the
decline can be speedily arrested it is quite possible that
even a reduction of interest to 3 per cent, won't enable
the bank to show a balance on the right side of its
accounts. Altogether there is nothing of a cheering
character in sight, and the City of Melbourne’s prospects
look rather blank. A good part of the famous Melb. Board
of Works loan is in this concern' by the way.
• • • *
The little Royal Bank of Australia, which sur-
vived the boom and the burst and the worst of the
depression, still keeps its little head above water. For
the half-year ending Sept., ’94, it made a nett profit of
£2894. This half its nett profits are £2137, so, though
there is a diminution, it is still well on the right side of
the ledger. The cash reserve lias increased by £lB,OOO,
and now equals 35 per cent, of the liabilities a propor-
tion which is needlessly large, and which sacrifices profit
to a too great yearning after security. The note
and bill circulation, deposits, and bills receivable
have all increased, showing that the Royal’s business
connection holds together. There is no dividend, how-
ever—in fact there hasn't been one for a considerable
time ; and when the Victorian Companies Act is alt-red
to enable joint-stock institutions to reduce capital,
the Royal of Australia propos -s to write off an amount
(not yet stated) to cover losses. As the total advances
are only £400,000 this depreciation is not likely lo he very
heavy ; in fact the hank could write off 75 per cent, of
this and still survive. Meanwhile, however, the deranged
Act makes writing off lost capital unlawful, therefore the
Royal—like the City of Mdb urne—can’t, by any legal
process, put its exact position before the public.

The Equitable Society U.S.—“the biggest life

amount to thirty-eight and a half million pounds. Also,
the surplus n( its assets over liabilities has increased by
over £1,000,000, and it now possesses £7,787,460 mure
than it owes. Theref >re, it is in a position to report that
it has the biggest surplus on earth, as well as the biggest
business on earth, and that it is the biggest thing on this
earth generally. If the Equitable keeps on expanding for
an indefinite period, it seems as if there may b ■ a lime in

H >w the silver problem comes home to roost.
Japan is comp lied by treaty ifot to charge more than a
very small revenue duly on British goods. But the price
of silver keeps falling, chiefly' through Britain’s mono-
metallic policy, and this is how it pans out. Seven years
ago iron pipes were sent from Britain to Japan at £4 4s.
per to i, equal to 28dol. in Jap. silver. Now the price is
only £4 a ton, hut £4 is equal to 40 dollars in Jap silver.
Tne I oca) silver coin goes as far as ever in Japan, but it
only goes about half as far in belying gold with which to
pay for British iron pipes. Therefore, the local pipes
have, in seven y ears, recehed protection to the extent of
40 per cent. Therefore, Japan makes her own pipes
now, and the British manufacturer wails in the back-
ground and asks why this is thus.

man Stewart’s opinion, no doubt honest, is discounted by
the fact that he happens to be a gas-shareholder. The
Council’s intervention in electric-lighting will break up
the companies’ ring and thus prove a fresh menace to
gas. Several other councillors indicated their oppo-ition,
but a blessed penalty prevents such of them as are
monetarily interested from voting. State and Civic

brown coal for railway purposes has been definitely

brown coal, was attempted. When a small mountain of
fuel had been piled on the tender, the stoker began to
feed the ready-made furnace. The feeding continued
without intermission until the train came to a slight
hank, near Werribee, where the engine planted its wheels
firmly on the rails and refused to proceed further. The
driver called upon his snorting iron steed t) do its best,
and the stoker rammed brown coal into its overloaded

The Bulletin’s Pambnla correspondent:—The
Chosen have long been dabbling in Pambula, but Iheir
last proposed deal did not come off. The Sydney-London
Jewish syndicate did not buy the Faikner Co.’s mine as
intended, the reason ascribed being that the leas? was
too small (only 2J acres), and the adjoining leaseholders
asked too much for their holdings. One leaseholder on
the north, whosg ground comes within 100 ft. of th? last
rich find on Falkner’s, and carries the same fissure lode
through the centre of tbe lease, asked £l5O for his ’ -alf.
The Faikner 00. has secured the other half from one of
their employes, who sold at a very modest sum. The
other leaseholders (Victory G.M. Co.) on the eastern side
of the Faikner Co., into whose ground the lode carry-

in a very short while. “It is merely a matter of calcula-
tion, not speculation. The mine has been thoroughly
test-d in every part, and the richness ascertained. The
diamonds average from half-carat to a carat; some are
sin viler, some much larger. The largest, as mentioned in
your paper previously, was 11 carats 2 grains. I have had
also diamonds of five and six carats. lam confident that
larger diamonds will be found on the bottom. The dia-

Colonial Enterprise, a London financial
paper, says of Australian diamonds: “Every stone
brought t i a saleable condition involves an outlay thrice
as great as the stone will sell for. The Dutch cutters
positively refuse to purchase them, because of the diffi-
culty of cutting, and all who have had any experience in
the cutting of diamonds agree that they are too hard, too
brittle, too small, and too frequently imperfectly
crystallised to be worth handling.” The Bulletin has
heard this theory before, butf so f>r has met no one
capable of giving final judgment upon it. It certainly is
curious that after all the drum-heats at Bingera, the
Cope millionaires, always so ready to make money, do not

A Westralian correspondent to Thk Bulletin :
—“A certain ‘great’ mine here, the other day, d cided
to pay its miners £3 10s. and water, in lieu of *£B 12s,
without ditto. After supplying the valuable fluid for two
d lys, the original wage (£3 12s. without water) was again
resorted to. And the mine people actually slopped the
difference, 4d. per d iy, or Bd. in all, out of Ihe men’s
wages! Very little sympathy goes out to those mine-
owners in their present disillusionment.”

Dear Bulletin, —Have just arrived from Wes-
tralia after visiting and trying mv luck at Mt. Margaret,
Siberia, Kurnalpi, Menzies’and Dunn’s. Only at the latter
place did I make tucker. It is wonderful ho.« things are
exaggerated. The glowing reports given of the various
reefs, or rather blows, are, so far as I can see, quite un-
warranted. Outside the Wealth of Nations, Londonderry
and Bayley's, I have seen little, and the two former shows
are yet unproven, and are nursed by trained hands. Out-
side of a few well-equipp»d “knowing” prospectors, few
have done any good. Before the end of the year the
bottom will, 1 believe, he out of many of the Coolgardie
mines.—Yours, A Stawbll Keefer of 20 Years. Melb.,
April 6, ’95.

The Londonderry Co. “ has a total length of 20
chains on the line of reef which is going down with every
sign of permanence. It is doubtful if, to a co._ with
capital to work a big reef of fair-grade stone, it is not
more valuable than the rich narrow shoot ever promised
to be. There is, then, every probability of further rich
shoots being met with in the vicinity of the golden hole."
But, then, where is the Australian quartz-mine (sold un-
developed for a "king’s ransom ”) which ever paid divi-
dends on anything like a £700,000 capital? And, as to
striking rich shoots, why, you might strike one in George-
street, Sydney, if you put down a bore.

The Londonderry United Blocks Co., with a

turn a dividend out of the ground?

The best-cursed man in Coolgardie and many
Other places is Lord Fingall. Had he kept silent
until the Londonderry battery was up, hundreds of thou-
sands of shares would have changed hands, and other
blocks near by would have been traded off in London. As
it is, he took the lid off the camp-oven too soon. H;
administered the death-blow without warning, and is exe-
crated accordingly. Lord Fingall is a lot too honest for a
new goldfield.

The “rig” in “Australia” (Westralian) gold-

be in accordance with head-I win-toil-you-lose Stock
Exchange ethics, few people have much sympathy with
those who sell what they haven’t got. The smarties have
been poisoned with their own wheat. When the directors
of the Australia met to allot, it was found that the list
washy no means full, so it was determined to allot in ; fuil
to those who had applied, and to pool the balance of the
shares. Then some of them set to work to buy on the
Exchange and were liberally accommodated ; but when
the time came for delivery of shares none were td be
had. Thus the bears were fairly cornered, and the carry-
ing-over price has been gradually raised until it has
reached the figure given above. The outcome has yet to
lie seen, and it is not at all improbable that the Warner’s
Safe Cure business will be repeated. It will be remem-
bered that the ordinary shares of that co., which had
been sold heavily by bears, were run up to £4O before a
compromise was arrived at. All this kind of thing will,
however, do much harm to Westralian mining invest
ments.

Gov. Buxton, -who comes to South Aus-
tralia in July, is obviously another party-hack re-
warded for purse-istent services to the Liberal
cause. He differs from the late Gov. Duff in
being a rank political failure, whereas the chosen
fur N.S. Wales was, at all events, a success of
mediocrity. Gov. Buxton did actually get into
Parliament 30 years ago ; but after 3 years’ trial
his constituents were so disgusted that he has
never been elected since, though he has tried his
hustings luck no less than five times ! Not being
able to become an insignificant member of the
Commons, Gov. Buxton is naturally well fitted to
administer an Australian province. His fortune
is founded on Beer (Buxton’s ales being celebrated),
but, lest this circumstance should create suspicion,
the cable-man is careful to lay stress on bis equally
British devotion to Bible. “Sir Thomas is a
man of strong evangelical tendencies!” Lady
Buxton is in poor health, which is not wonderful,
cunsidering all these things, and considering alsa
that ten junior Buxtons are growing up to legacies
in the celebrated XXX.
The Bulletin charitably sizes-up Gov. Buxton
beforehand as a pious, pompous, portly personage,
with few brains, a splendid digestion, and a fine
crop of John Brrll prejudices. Flabbergasted
S. A., cabling to know why on earth the evangeli-
cal brewer was appointed to rule over her, learnt
that “the only reason assigned is that he is cousin
tu Mr. Sydney Charles Buxton, Parliamentary
Secretary to the Colonial Office ! ” Up the back-
stairs to Australia !
• • •
Goy. Buxton, by the way, will nob reach
Adelaide before September; Gov. Brassey may
keep Melbourne waiting till October, or even
longer. Ttiese postponed Governors are prac-
tically tempting Australia to ask why, in the
name of common-sense, they are considered
necessary. If N.S.W., Victoria and S.A. can
struggle through this next winter with ne'er a
vice-regal person among the three of them, they
may as w’ell put their Government Houses up to
auction and make other arrangements.

A certain prominent
Melbourne Ladies’ Club
at present represents a
house divided against
itself. At the business-
meetings real abuse is
indulged in, and the
feathers fly in all direc-
tions. One member
c dlel another “ a double-
faced old woman ” the
other day, to which she
cff-elively replied, “Not
quite so old as you, any-
how.” And so things
went on. It would seem
that the golden bowl of
friendship is not to be
cemented at that club,
and there are vague
rumors of the malcon-
tents taking themselves
off and forming a rival
establishment o f their
own.
Given the British brewer, could one not
easily foretell the evangelical tendencies and the
swarming family of S. A.’s Governor-designate?

Readers of Melb. Paunch, who have
skimmed that organ’s account of Hopetoun’s de-
parture, don’t now speak of hysterics. They call
’em Murphysterics. For example :
Most people seem to be deploring the going away of
Lord and Lady Hopetoun as though the departure had
robbed them of close personal friends. . , . Quite a
feeling of loneliness semis to have taken possession of
Melbourne, where the Hopetouns were so loved. On
Tuesday evening, a lady 1 know said to her husband, “I
don’t know how it is, but I feel as though I had lost some-
thing,” and the husband replied, “That is just how 1
feel."
• • »
An incident of the early Hopetoun days in
Victoria. Two very special samples of the Vic.
“fooroe” were on duty at Govt. House—one of
them an irrepressible masher with any amount of
nerve. Two young lady relatives of Lady Hope-
toun were playing tennis, and one of them hit
the ball out of the court. Neither girl was aware
of the proximity of the “coppers,” and, looking
for the ball, encountered the Adonis in blue. He
had secured the ball, and, seeing that the pair
were “ fair to look upon,” insisted upon joining in
the game. The girls and the bobby argued the
point to rags, and in the end the former left the
field to the latter. His Ex. got to hear of the
affair, and was besought to throw the offender
into the deepest dungeon, but all that came of the
trouble was the substitution of a cooler and older
man for the youthful guardian of law’norder.
The substitution of the grand organ for
the nasal organ in synagogue worship, is causing
some commotion among Melb. Hebrews. The
principal feature of the Jewish service has always
been the principal feature of the Hebrew himself.
The nasal chant that rises from a synagogue on
feast days and fast days is only less remarkable
than the sight of 500 miscellaneous pawnbrokers
and bookmakers huddled together, with their hats
on, and never a Christian to make a profit out of.
The beauty of this scene is to be abandoned in
Melb. A Gentile organist and a mixed choir are
to be admitted—and modern music from swelling
throats is to replace the antique chants from
swelling noses.

employer or political or social dignitary, and asked
all particulars about the vacancy. “I have here

him the chance. A capital fellow. He’ll take ss.
or 10s. a week leas than you offer while you are
trying him. Oblige; I’ll do as much for you

plication into his basket. The weary-legged men

In a wide office, big
enough for a Parliamen-

clerks. There is no oil-

uneven boards, the vacant
desks all round gather
dust, and sanguine flies
try the dried ink-wells.
On the cobwebbed walls
there are light squares
where old files, maps, and
almanacs used to hang.
In the desk marked
“Receiving Teller” is a
greasy packet, obviously
the lunch of one of the
clerks. All the moveable
furniture desks an d
chairs and tables— has
disappeared ; the ledgers
have a seedy, fartliing-in-

who seems to be a con-

inner room, and one of
the clerks tacks up a
notice, “ Dividends pay-

A few years ago the police used to aver,

couldn’t buy bad liquor in Sydney. Now, pub-
licana who vend bottled hell-fire are being fined
heavily every day, on the information of the mar-
vellously-active licensing-inspector, who visits
their houses, “ takes ” samples and tenders the
equivalent in money. It is, in a few days, to be
argued before the Full Court whether a publican
who supplies liquor under such circumstances can
be regarded as having made a “ sale.” For one of
the publicans concerned it is being contended that
such a transaction is not a lecral “ sale” and that
therefore the fine was unlawful. The Bulletin
hopes to see a public assurance from the Sydney
Licensed Victuallers’ Association that it is not
raising, or winking at, the objection. If it is .

tiie people who followed the prophet Eugene to
South Africa, and the people who followed the
alleged prospective millionaire to Toorak, are all
beautiful examples of man’s incurable credulity.
Also, the people who will follow the next prophet,
or claimant, or hairy healer, and the one that
comes after him, and all his successors, will
further illustrate the same great circumstance.

A recent notable wedding in London was
that of Miss Gertrude Leith Hay, daughter of the
late Mr. James Leith Hay, once the popular
P.M. at Ipswich (Bananaland), with Mr. Maxwell
de la Combe. It was an exceedingly smart affair,
says The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
no end of real fashionables being present, for the
Leith-Hays are “Somebodies” in Scotland, and
the young lady’s brother is heir to extensive
estates.

N.S.W. Civil Service Commission, in re-
commending that candidates for the Publio Ser-
vice shall be obliged to pass a medical examina-
tion, travel in an approved administrative line.
Candidates for employment in U. States Post-
office are obliged to pass not only a general
medical examination but to produce a special
dental certificate testifying that their teeth are
sound. It is singular, by-the-by, what poor teeth
Republicans have when a Democrat is President;

When Jabez Balfour goes to court
To answer for his crimes,
Will Melbourne read a full report
And think of former times?
Will Justice screen her blushing face
Whilst careless fools deride
All mention of their town’s disgrace,
When Jabez has been tried,
Been tried —
When Jabez has been tried ?
When Jabez Balfour’s guilt is proved
By barristers-at-law,
Will Melbourne’s drowsy dupes be moved
Comparisons to draw
Betwixt the fictions there employed
To thrust the truth aside
And wholesome justice unalloyed ?
When Jabez lias been tried,
Been tried—
When Jabez has been tried.
When Jabez Balfour gets his dues,
And Hingland offers thanks,
Will rascals shiver in their shoes
Anigh the Yarra banks?
Ah ! no. Barabbas, safe and sound,
In Melbourne shall abide,
By legal humbug hedged around,
When Jabez has been tried,
Been tried —
When Jabez has been tried.

mately drifts, failing a Slate monopoly, into the hands of
a very few big and closely-supervised publicans all the
better. Meanwhile, the law should hold each wholesale
or retail vendor of poisoned liquor responsible for the
poison whether he himself put it in or not. Another
thing : any importer, merchant or publican convicted of
selling poisonous liquor should be compelled by law to
exhibit on all the outer doors of his premises, for a
month or two, a calico-sign printed in blue with a red
border notifying that he was a convicted poisoner.

During her absence she has been identified with

846 Maoquarie-streeb North, Sydney,
April 16, 1895,
My Dear Moorabisda—
Probably the most trying message of condolence
received by a lately-bereaved lady came from the
mayor of a one-horse back-block town, whose well-
meant message ran : “The Mayor of Glanktown
sympathises with and family in their
bereavement, and trusts they will realise our
Heavenly Father is a husband to the widow and a
father to the fatherless.” It really sounds as if
his worship was specially recommending Provi-
dence to fill an extraordinary vacancy.
I don’t like people who—there are many such—
advertise Heaven as persistently as if it wanted
puffing like a variety-show. I sat opposite a
yellow-faced, sour-expressioned woman in a ’bus
the other day, and I was wondering if her gloomy
appearance was due to piety, or liver, or both,
when my eye fell on her brooch, which settled the
point. It consisted of three words, written in
silver, and they were—“ God is Love.” It looked
about the most aggressively - heavenly bit of
jewellery I have ever seen holding any woman’s
collar together ; and what an example it was of
self-advertising righteousness! But I couldn’t
help thinking of the other side of the case. If
one pins her collar with a confession of faith, what
is to prevent the unfaithful from airing her un-
orthodox opinions in the same way ? Fancy the
sensation a pretty girl would make if she wore
“ The Devil ” (in diamonds) to fasten her bonnet-
strings? Also, think of the hundred-and-one
faiths there are to barrack for! “Buddha for
Ever” may become the swagger theosophioal
brooch if the idea catches on.
Sydney Women’s College, “ within the Univer-
sity ” (but if you dismiss your wheelbarrow at the
door of the ’Varsity proper you have to go about
a mile across country, and through people’s back
yards to get at it), still holds the belt as the
champion money-sieve of Australia. Erudite
circles must be getting quite tired of trotting out
their (little parlor-tricks in order to raise more
funds to keep the depressing edifice from being sold
up and converted into a hide-store, or something
else hideous but profitable. The committee people
are at their wits’ end for amusements. They have
sung themselves hoarse, danced themselves giddy,
and play-acted to the verge of nervous prostration
in order to keep the white elephant from falling
into the hands of the Philistines, and now the
only thing left to them is an “ Exhibition of
Works of Art and objects of historical interest,”
which is to be the next outbreak in aid of the
funds of the ever-ravenous college. “Objects of
historical interest ” ought to be genuine. Some of
our first families are doubtless in a position to
supply the exhibition with many interesting relics,
N.S.W. Agricultural Society had a good day
for the formal opening of its interesting annual
show, on the 11th instant. A far larger crowd
attended than usually turns up for the opening,
when so much time goes in forms and ceremonies.
Acting-Governor Darley opened the show from a
dais, the ornamental aspect of which quite failed
to impress me. lam not an admirer of finicking
nic-naos as a staging for public speakers, but I
certainly don’t consider models of women’s dresses-
on tailors’ dummies, with huge placards—“ This
style 355. ” —at all a fitting background for the
handsome and stately Lieut.-Gov., whose own
style is nothing so cheap as that, though the
placard would fit same public men I have seen like
a new glove. There was not a very impressive
gathering on the dais. For one thing, Lady
Darley wasn’t there (Court mourning forbade),
and the platform was almost as free from petti-
coats as the pulpit.
An air of gloom was cast over the formalities by
the constant reference to poor Gov. Duff (who
first called us his subjects, you remember, at the
Agricultural Show), and even at the cheerful
luncheon in the marquee the vice-regal shade was
conjured up. A politician who perhaps had no
special reason to admire the late adminis-
trator (I noticed his wife absent-mindedly wore
colors) began the perfunctory dirge, and the
Acting-Governor followed suit. By the way, I
thought the president rather threw down the
democratic gauntlet when he remarked that he
didn’t care how long the Acting-Governor (who
seems popular—but it’s so difficult to tell at a
banquet) reigned over us ! His Excellency made
a judicial speech, in which ho concealed his plea-
surable emotions in a way that die .ufinite credit
to his legal training. Even the most intelligent
jury could not have discovered by his countenance
what his Honor’s personal opinion was of the
Agricultural Show case. In only one phrase was
his Excellency’s coolness at fault: “ I know rather
more than less of agriculture,” he said, the context
proving that he meant quite the reverse. Still,
H.E. ought to be a fair judge of horsehair.
The luncheon was admirably carried out. I
noticed that several M.’sP, were most attentive to
the numerous ladies present, carving and pouring
and ladling in Ohesterfieldian form. It was very
nice and must have saved the waiters a great deal,
but I hope it didn’t signify that woman-suffrage
is getting nearer and that astute politicians are
trimming their sails accordingly? There were a
great many women present. The diminutive
Mayoress Lees sported a pretty dress of ultra-
marine blue subdued with brown and topped off
by a smart toque. Mrs. John See, in black with
gaps of pale sapphire (reminiscent of glimpses of
blue sky seen from a coal-cellar) and a gauzy,
becoming hat, had her hair dressed a la Francaise.
Mrs. Frank Wright wore a handsome dress of
strawberry-corded silk trimmed with bullion gimp;
Mrs. McNeill was in black brocade and jet. And,
talking of beads and wampum, I would like to
remind women who wear sharp wings at the back
of their pork-pie hats that they should be careful
how they move their heads when anybody is sitting
close behind them. Only fainting women like
feathers up their noses.
The Agricultural Society is improving the Ag.
ground beyond recognition, now that members
read their title clear to the aforesaid patch of con-
quered sand. Telephones and touch-and-go
hurdles were the features this time—the next in-
novation is to be a grandstand on the eastern side
of the ring, which will have (I mean the grand-
stand) a sloping lawn forninst it —a much-needed
improvement, as the present grandstand is a mere
broiling-place owing to its westerly aspect. With
a new stand the Agricultural Society’s ground
will be very neatly put together.
The Show of ’95 was full of all manner of
practical and wonderful things, but most interest
centred, as usual, in the horses. The first half of
the hunting contest (for Nimrod and Diana) was
very thrilling, though only one lady fell off, and
she must be congratulated for falling very prettily
indeed and remounting immediately, which quite
took the edge off her disaster. The rest of the
girls stuck like wax and rode cleverly with head
and hands; and although I don’t agree with women
bumping over four-foot jumps, still I would have
keenly enjoyed the huntresses’ performances if
fate hadn’t placed me near an excited elderly lady
who said “ Gee ! ” and “Whoa!” and “Softly,
old chap!’’and “Steady, you brute!” and who
audibly lifted every nag over his timber just as if
there wasn’t a lady on his back. This kind of
camp-fire Amazon is worse than the woman
who hums a bar ahead of the music at
the opera, and ought to be suppressed with a
strong hoof. The competing equestriennes were
neatly, though not fashionably, turned out. One
lady had a furious rush of padding to the wrong
place, but the oddest figure of all rode outside
the ring. She wore a badly-cut coffee-color get-
up, be-buttoned like a costermonger ; a tall hat
and her hair in a bob completed the travesty.
By the way, one girl rode a chestnut with a
white bridle. I couldn’t help thinking that it
looked as if she had fixed the neddy up with her
petticoat-strings.
The Reverend Haweis strikes me as being a
good comedian spoilt in the baking. Though I
don’t think he is spoilt at all, really, because he is
a captivating lecturer added to a comedian, who
invests the most abstruse subjects with a bright
and festive air, that is irresistibly magnetic. Per-
sonally, the outspoken Mr. H. is a short man with
an egg-shaped and hairless countenance and a
small quantity of longish hair which turns up at
the ends. He has small hands and feet, and
walks with a silver-mounted ebony cane like the
father in melodrama. In some of his moods his
manner and the subject matter of his aesthetic
discourse reminded me distinctly of Dot Bouci-
oault as Fergusson Pybus. Though it is difficult
to definitely fix a man who is versatility personi-
fied, still there certainly is a strong resemblance
to Fergusson P. Mr. Haweis dutifully advertised
the lenders of the two violins with which he
musically illustrated his remarks. Ido hate
advts., even in a pantomime. I quite ex-
pected Mr. Haweis to hop back on to the stage
after the interval, remarking that he was quite
revived by a drop of the real old Scotch (manu-
factured by Blank) in a bottle of (Dash & Sons’
unequalled) soda.
“Music and Morals” was Mr. Haweis’s first
lecture in Sydney, and he gave music the best
character she can ever hope to get in this world.
Music is not moral, generally speaking. Tolstoi
doesn’t think it is, at any rate; and I once knew a
lady who wouldn’t buy her infant son a penny
whistle lest he should grow up fond of music and
be led astray. When you think of the ethical
record of ladies who sing soprano—to say nothing
of the gentlemen who sing tenor —it really does
seem difficult to make an honest muse of Euterpe.
Mr. H. is a deep-thinking man who barracks for
the ancients, and laughs at modern achievements
in every art save music, and whose deeply cul-
tured, modern way of putting things ought to act
upon the closed soul of the “outside vulgar ” like
an oyster-knife upon an oyster. Of course, Mr. H.
is a transoendentalist: “ Music lifts us out of our-
selves,” he said in conclusion; “we touch the
invisible.” But I think he ought to have added,
“if we have long hair.”
One man has the lion’s share of the epigrams in
Oscar Wilde’s play, “The Ideal Husband,” at
Sydney Lyceum—naturally, not the ideal himself.
I don’t suppose a cynical man ever made an ideal
husband —matrimony must offer too many oppor-
tunities for the exercise of that sort of thing to
make even a sunny cynic a popular domestic
character. So Oscar Wilde puts almost all his
epigrams into a bachelor’s mouth. When the cur-
tain falls the bachelor is going to be married, and
one cannot help feeling a little doubtful about the
bride’s chances of felicity with a man who brags
to a woman of the superiority of his sex. I quite
believe in his principle, of course ; but then, it’s
not the most superior men who mention it. I
think man’s superiority is like woman’s virtue.
Directly he begins to talk about it, it’s gone.
The forceful Geraldine Olliffe reappeared in
the “Ideal Husband ” as the wicked woman—but
she was badly dressed for the part. I base my
assertion on the fact that a number of dies: circle
youths (whose judgment we ought to icspect in
such matters) did not like her gowns. Now, an
adventuress whose wardrobe isn’t attractive to
men is somewhat of an anomaly, it seems to me.
The first set of harness was handsome enough, and
perhaps atoned for the others. It was of absinthe-
green silk, the skirt edged with brown fur
in Vandykes. A flight of golden butterflies,
soaring from the left side of the hem and tapering
off at the right hip, adorned the skirt; and a few
small butterflies also peppered the bodice, which
had an upright ornament of gold moths and pom-
pons. It was a gorgeous garment, but all
men hate green—even Irishmen. Her next dress
reminded me of a native cat —a black skirt
peppered with large white spheres, as if somebody
had been pelting her with Brobdingnagian pepper-
mint drops, and topped by a black blouse trimmed
with fur. The third dress reminded me of
Mephistopheles when he is supposed to be in-
visible. The skirt was black velvet, but the
folded bodice and off-the-shoulder sleeves were
flame-red, and so was the silken lining of the
cloak.
Miss Faber wore two exceedingly tasteful
dresses. In her first act, a white silk, with long
falling scarf of white chiffon, and a brown squirrel-
tail over each shoulder. In the second (when the
scenery, a riot of chocolate and gold, must have
made dressing a difficult matter for the ladies in
the scene) Miss Faber wore a soft and picturesque
receiving-gown of pale-grey silk—the bodice made
of accordeon-pleated grey crepon. Round her
waist, round her neck, and depending from her
wrists, were purple violets in most artistic arrange-
ment. But the black-and-blue blouse of the last
act was too ultra-**fashionable ” to become Miss
Faber, in whom there is a Quakerish element, and
whose style is too quaint for her to look well in
what everyone wears. Miss Grace Noble’s blue
brocade, trimmed with violets (don’t grit your
teeth—the ensemble was charming), was her best
gown. Among the smaller lights, Miss Wilmot
looked clever in cream, and Miss Bessie Tarrant
(“Miss Hammond ”) sported a cheerfully pretty
frock in pale-blue and pink brocade. There was
an enormous audience, and it certainly must have
been most discouraging for enquiring maidenhood
to see so many society matrons gloating over the
ideal husband just the same as the spinsters did
who live on hope—the hope deferred which maketh
the nose blue. I thought it reflected dread-
fully on the Australian house-father to see so
many married women rushing to see what an
ideal husband is like.
Vice-regal people don’t keep their eyes shut.
Lady Loch was martyred in the farewell-presenta-
tion cause so that succeeding governoresses might
gracefully decline to be publicly humiliated in the
same manner—there hasn’t been a vice-regal pre-
sentation since those awful diamonds made a page
in Victoria’s social history. Lady Duff, wise in
advance, refuses to be the horrible example of
what may happen to a vice-regal lady who allows
Guv’ment to erect a monument (for which tenders
would ptobably be called) over the long home of
her husband. By the way, the Mayoress of
Sydney convened a public meeting of women at
the Town Hall last Tuesday “to arrange a fitting
farewell to Lady Duff.”
At the sale of vice-regal effects Miss Duff’s side-
saddle fetched .£B —£2 more than Lady Margaret
Villiers’ saddle brought. Lady Margaret’s is
now the pride of a livery-stable, which does a
roaring trade with it on barmaids’ Sundays-out.
The first two days of the A.J.O. Autumn meet-
ing at Rand wick made a very poor show from a
butterfly point of view, owing to what Uncle Sam
would call pure cussed ness on the part of the
weather. Society (or the damp remnant of it that
turned upon Easter Saturday and Monday) did
not trot out the new and dashing confection it had
individually up its sleeve (by the way, is that the
reason modern sleeves are so big—because modern
women have such a lot hidden there?) for fear of
damaging a probably unpaid-for article, which is
the most disheartening tiling a woman can do.
Certainly some of the ladies wore gorgeous apparel
and looked as apropos to their environment of
sloppy lawns and pelting rain as peacocks in a
shower-bath, but the well-dressed brigade seemed to
have taken pains to look ugly. Golf capes (every-
body wears a “golf’’cape, even if she can’t dis-
tinguish a niblick from a putter) and skirts, a
combination which is to be worn this season in
place of the comfortable coat and jacket, had it
all their own warm way. But though such
raiment is decidedly suitable and sensible and all
the rest of the common-sense adjectives which one
ever applies to the ugly—it is not lovely to look
upon. “Shall I tell you a secret?” says Mrs.
Quesnel in “Rebellious Susan.” “All women
look well in fur.” So they do—but Heaven save
them from waterproofs 1
Maude Hobson, writes my Melb. correspondent,
is much the handsomest girl in the Gaiety 00., and
wears byfar thesnappiestgowns. In thepompadour
brocade, with slap-dash “ sensations ” of cerise
and green, which she wears in the second act of
“The Gaiety Girl,” she looks like a sunset:
while the cream satin empire gown, edged
with sable and embroidered down the front
with gold thread, makes every female beholder
sigh with envy that Providence did not make her
a Gaiety girl, particularly as with this creation
Maude wears her far-famed diamonds and superb
turquoises. In the bathing-machine scene, how-
ever, one gets the impression that “Lady
Virginia ” is simply clothed in the half-doors of
the machine and a happily-placed bunch of forget-
me-nots. '
Grace Palotta affects, throughout the piece, a
neatness and precision in her gowning thoroughly
characteristic of the Frenchwoman. In the first
act she wears simple brown cloth ; in the second,
artless pink muslin, which she changes for a nun-
like garb of black and white. In spite of this
simplicity, however, she manages to “get there
all the same ” Her song with its French refrain
is simply delicious.
Blanche Massey, who comes with the label,
“prettiest woman in England,” stands round
nicely and thinks hard (when she is not clinging
to Ryley’s manly shoulders) in floppy gowns of
white satin trimmed with costly-looking lace.
White satin seems to have been invented for
women built like Miss Massey, who is decidedly
not of the type that takes to bicycles and rational
dress and clamors for the franchise.
The wife of a well-known Vie. medico waa
much remarked upon at a late Fleming ton race-
meeting for the volmninousnesa of her dreas. Her
subsequent action disclosed the reason of her
sudden increase of girth. She and her maid and
her muoh-decked-out child were observed to dis-
appear into one of the arches of a bridge that
spans a cutting. She went in clad in gorgeously-
trimmed velvet, she came out —considerably re-
trenched—in serge. She had to catch an up-
country train directly the races were over, and
had come prepared with one dress over the other.
She had no time to get to the dressing-room,
but proved herself the right kind of woman
for an emergency. She caught her train ; and the
maid, with the velvet tucked up under her arm in
a loose parcel, went back with the child to town.
Mrs. Wicken, the cookery-expert, who has
worked wonders in Australian cooking, and upon
whom many a married man calls'down the choicest
blessings, purposes setting up an afternoon tea-
room at Sydney School of Arts, where one may
obtain not only a good cup of tea and dainty
sweets, but also order (wholesale or retail) any
kind of light refreshment. On after-
noon Mrs. Wicken entertained at tea a number of
Sydney ladies (headed by a Supreme Court Judge’s
wife), to introduce the new project. After a
short lecturette on how to make several high-class
sweets, which Mrs. Wicken exp.-rtly mixed in full
view of the audience, a cup of very special lea and
very novel sweets (draught-board cakes .- re the
latest, in checks of chocolate and almond paste)
were served up to the crowd, which included a
brace of infants, who looked as if they were having
a glimpse of the land of lollipops. I think the
School of Arts tea-room will prosper. It ought to
be especially handy for the scholars and teachers
m the institution ; and a place where one can be
quite sure of the ingredients should be patronised
by everybody who likes to be certain she isn’t
chewing flies instead of currants.
The war with China, which apparently goes on
for ever, encouraged a Sydney paper to devote
two columns to an (ostensible) description of the
Emperor of China’s harem-girls—but I think the
thing reads like a skit on “ Society ” all over the
world. This quotation for'instance “Almost
every family in China looks forward to the time
when it can send the daughter of the household
up to Pekin. For that purpose, if for no other,
each girl with any pretensions to looks is carefully
taught to paint, embroider and carry herself well,
and recite a few poems . , . She is also taught
how to prepare her toilet, and keep herself in as
perfect condition as possible for a Chinese girl.”
Most of our unappreciated belles want to gn
“ to Pekin.” Every woman who is ready to marry
a monied title wants logo “ to Pekin.”' All those
parents who are ready to hand over their daughter
to the highest bidder in cash and “blood” want
to send her to Pekin. Yum Yum isn’t the only
young woman who paints her pretty face and dyes
her anaemic lips, in order to compete for thematri
monial step-up which is the only true feminine
promotion after all, and which is chiefly to be
found at Pekin.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Among the passengers Jjpom Sydney for

Landowner and rent-guzzler Daniel Cooper
is enquiring the whereabouts of more old Aus-
tralian postage-stamps. He received £3OOO lately
•for one of his collections, among which were many
of the earliest N.S.W. issues.
Bishop Green, of Grafton and Armidale,
begins to worry over his vanished stipend. The
late Bishop Pearson, of Newcastle, was similarly
•troubled over the finances of his diocese, and he
kept up the worry till his brain-strings snapped.
The reported retirement of N.S.W. hang-
man Howard (who is well over 60) is somewhat
premature. The gentleman, it would appear, was
told that if he did retire he would get an allow-
ance of something like £500; but he asked for a
pension.
Melb. Argus says Oscar Wilde’s books
and plays should be boycotted in Australia. But,
however unmanly Wilde’s alleged vices, surely the
goodness or badness of the man has nothing at all
to do with his work as an artist. Byron was a
libertine, buthe wrote “Childe Harold,” J. M. W.
Turner was anything but a saint, but he painted
“The Fighting Temeraire.” James T-mmson
was a drunkard, hut he was the author of “ The
City of Dreadful Night.”

Lomax, the Vic. P.O.
■detective, who died lately,
was one of the shrewdest
of men. His iiauit of
always pouncing on an evil-
doer at the correct moment
gained him the nickname
of “ Climax.” His methods
of working were peculiarly
simple. If letters or valu-
ables were missed from any
P. 0., he would pick out
whomsoever he suspected
as the likely offender, and
have him transferred to
another office. If the pil-
fering still continued, he
would conclude that he had
moved the wrong man and
send away another and
«o on till the trouble
■ceased. However, he

concealed in the ceiling
above the stamping-table
for nearly twenty - four
hours, with his eye applied
to a hole in the centre-
flower, watching for a sus-
pect to pocket a catch-
letter ; and not even the
post-mistress knew of his
presence.
Lord Alcesfcer (Sir Beauchamp Seymour,
once on the Australian station), who died lately,
was a terribly high and mighty old buck. A
nephew of his relates how he paid a farewell visit
to uncle (the Admiral) before leaving for Aus-
tralia. Uncle adjured him to cultivate family
pride, and make a point of despising the vulgar
masses in the beastly vulgar land which he was
about to honor with his presence. The nephew in
Question became an honest house-agent, and didn’t
■despise, anybody who paid the rent regularly.
Wesbralian Premier Forrest receives daily
about 100 applications from new arrivals for
Government situations. He also has personal
interviews daily with about fifty people in search
of Government pay, and manages to receive them
all courteously.
Mr. J. R. Fairfax, of S.M. Herald, thinks
military titles come next in dignity to ecclesias-
tical ones. Thirty or more years ago he was
gazetted “Captain ” in a N.S.W. regiment.
“Captain James.” The Bulletin never thought
of that before.
Rev. Dr. Geikie, who will celebrate his
immaterial jubilee in Bathurst next week (April
25), was one of the best horsemen in the Monaro
district over 30 years ago. The old doctor (one
of an intellectually - distinguished family of
brothers) proposes to retire soon.
“Nat’’Gould, author and sporting-news-
paper man, speaking with a fellow-scribe before
leaving Australia the other day, said : “If you
want to make money by journalistic work keep
your name out of the newspapers. To be praised
in them is as injurious as to be blamed.”
The death of Professor Blackie recalls the
fact that the old gentleman was one of the victims
to the wiles of .Australia's friend, the fascinating
Mrs. Gordon-Baillie, to whom he more than once
addressed certain amorous poetical effusions, one
or two of which have lately come to light.
The still youthful Mr. Frank Senior, the
well-known Sydney chemist, now close upon 80,
held an umbrella open over the Duke of Edin-
burgh after O’Farrell had fired his almost fatal

broke it the other day over the back of a big dog.
Barrister Forlonge’s insinuation that Vic.
Supreme Court “sat on him ” lately, not because
of his conduct but because he practises both as
solicitor and barrister, is the same as that made
against Queensland Judges by Swanwiok, of Bris-
bane, when he adopted the amalgamated pro-
fession.
Prior Vaughan, now in Adelaide collecting
money for the execution of his scheme for the
“ betterment of the masses and the conversion of
the heathen at home,” pledges priests yet

The prisoner Dean, condemned to death
for the alleged poisoning of his wife at North

perhaps not had time to study the traditions of
the Botany Bay Executive.
The case of poor Gov. Duff is very like

Oscar Wilde, it is said, is a godson (“by
proxy”) of Charles Gavan Duffy, for whose
paper, the Nation, in its palmy days Oscar’s
mother, “Speranza,” wrote many stirring poems,
contemporary with those of “ Eva ” (the wife of
Doctor O'Doherty, of Brisbane). Duffy was in
Victoria when Wilde was born.
Mr. “Wingen” Abbott, the Australian
Complete Letter Writer, has now tackled “the
meejum of exchange,” and is in full blast on
Bimetallism in the daily papers. The Bulletin
hopes he’ll stick to the subject. It should prevent
the jaw of his pen from wagging on other topics,
and keep him going until he pegs out.
All the South Australian (R. 0.) arch-
bishops and bishops (six altogether) have been, or

are Dean Ryan and Father Maher. The former
is sure to be appointed, the submission of the
second name being a mere formality.
The Melbourne editors are contemptuously
ignorant of each other’s names. Reay, editor of
the Herald, gave evidence in the Downie libel-
case. His name is William Thomas Reay. The
Age calls him “William Jas. Reay,” and the
Argus calls him “Thomas Reay.” Reay is the
only editor in Melbourne who is an Australian
native.
Fitzwilliam Wentworth and his eldest son
are returning to Australia, and the later will at

in Sydney. Unlike most rich men, Mr, Went-
worth is determined that his sons shall not lead
idle lives. Later on, one of them will practise as
a mining-engineer, and another is qualifying as a
wool-expert.
A Bulletin man :—The sunflower in its
early bloom is a handsome thing. With the ex-
pansion of the petals the centre looms larger and
coarser, but still the effect is striking, at a dis-
tance. Then, as the petals wither, the centre
increases its circumference, until at last nothing
remains of the sunflower save a bloated seed head
on a dirty stalk. The emblem of Oscar Wilde.
Rev. H. R, Haweis, one of the “ Smythe
celebrities, 1895,” is a little, yellow, oldish man
with a nose like a door-knocker and a theory that
church should be made attractive. The ideal
church, so far as one can gather, would be a mix-
ture of hotel and music-hall, with a variety of
lively clergymen mounting the rostrum to give
five-minute “ turns ” about the Acts of the
Apostles. Mr. Haweis is described in “ A Green
Carnation ” as being “quite a clergyman-—except,
of course, when he is in church ” —and the label
fits him neatly.

The present Victorian Chief
Justice’s income at the Bar ia

Smug Dr. Bevan gave a very
pretty story to a Melb. interviewer
the other day. There is some-
thing in Forster’s “ Life of Dick-
ens ” which annoyed the Rev. T.
Binney, and he asked Forster to
take it out, but Forster wouldn’t
because he received it direct from
Dickens. Thereupon Dr. Bevan
proceeds to moralise. He went to
Binney’s funeral, which was im-
mense, and then he went to
Forster’s, where there were hardly
any mourners. Moral ? Why, of
course, it is suggested that Forster
—honest, sturdy Forster—went to
his own place, while Binney was
wafted skyward on luxurious beds
of down.
When the late “Joe ” Geary
was leader-writer on Melb. Her-
ald years ago, he was told that
another member of the staff said
he had a “down” on him. “I
never had a down on a man in my
life,” replied Joseph. “If a man
tries to harm me, I give him
plenty of rope and he hangs him-
self.” Benjamin Disraeli said the
same thing : “ I never trouble,”
says Dizzy, “to be avenged.
When a man injures me I put his
name on a slip of paper and lock
it up in a drawer. It is marvel-
lous how men I have thus
labelled have a knack of disap-
pearing.”
When Bishop Harper, of
Christchurch, (M.L.), died 15
months ago, a memorial committee
was formed, and it was decided to
invite subscriptions, the memorial
to take the shape of completing
the cathedral at a cost of .£15,000
to £20,000. The money was to
be subscribed immediately; and
ic was resolved that any surplus
above the few thousands needed
should be devoted to a memorial
gate, &o. After some months the
lists, with the aid of one sub-
scription of £lOO and several of
£25, had reached £3OO. Since
then, by persistent “bulldozing”
the sum has struggled up to £4OO.
Each of these clerical memorials
is the same history of obituary
gush and financial failure.
It is related that a young professional man,
anxious to court notoriety, if not celebrity, at any
price, wrote to Parkes asking for advice, and
setting forth that Parkes himself, as a young man,
had written similarly to Carlyle. The old man
did not answer for some time, then he wrote :
“Your case is not similar to mine, for, when I
was a young man, I was intelligent; you are not.”
When “Jack” Robertson was N.S.W.
Education Minister, a young man, whose preten-
sions were based on the marriage he had recently
made, called upon him and asked for a Civil Ser-
vice appointment. “How much do you think? ”
asked Robertson. “ £500,” said 'the modest
young man. “Oh,” chuckled old Jack, “you
want to start at the top of the tree and work
down.”
The brainy and unique Miss Catherine H.
Spence, member of “ Royal ” commission re Ade-
laide hospital troubles, is probably the first lady
ever appointed on a commission. Miss Spence is
over 60 years of age, and thinks of contesting an
Assembly seat next year to push her effective-
voting scheme. There is no man who knows her
who would not be glad to see her in Parliament if
she wished to go there.
Dr. Bride, of Melb. Public Library,
having taken the Vic. curatorship of intestate
estates, the librarianship is vacant. David Blair
(perhaps the best-qualified man in Australia in
point of knowledge) and Archer were Bride’s
former principal antagonists. There will be a
tussle for the post now, but the opinion is uni-
versal that an outsider, as Bride was, will get it.
Marcus Clarke held the office of assistant-
librarian under Tulk.
The imminent retirement of Inspector-
General Fosbery, of N.S.W. police, is again com-
ing up as a rumor. Three or four years ago it
was so proportioned that even “ the young, active
man with modern methods ” was talked of as
successor. Anyway, Fosbery has done over 40
years of good police work, half that time as Inspec-
tor-General, and it is not surprising that the im-
patience of “ young active men ” should provide a
basis for such rumors.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Two seats in N.S. Wales Assembly will
presently become vacant through bankruptcy.
Victorian: “We cheerfully submit to
income-tax to prevent the useless civil servants
from being turned away destitute.”
S.A. Oppositionists are already plotting
Kingston’s downfall. Vabien Solomon is to lead
next time, if the other 15 leaders consent.
“ When the Czar gives you an egg, he
expects a hen.”— Russian. Let Australians remem-
ber it, whenever they see one of their politicians
taking an Imperial title.
“ South Australia will never federate un-
less the Federal franchise is ‘ one person one vote.’
I did not think this at Hobart, but I do now,’’
said Premier Kingston recently.
At a Sydney private lunatic asylum there
hasbeendiscovered a patient whose first symptoms
of insanity are described as “ a desire to neglect
his business and become a member of Parliament.”
Mr. Hill, whosechief interprovincial distinc-
tion is the fact that he is father to Clem. Hill, the
orioketer, is generally believed to have the best
chance of being appointed sole S.A. Railway Com-
missioner under the new Act.
Moule, M.L.A., speaking at the Rusden
outbreak, said : “Manhood suffrage had come to
stay. What we (Melb. Reform Club) had to com-
bat was one man one vote.” Poor fool-Moule
imagines he has come to stay too !
Unless the work of consolidating the Vic.
statutes, so ably done by Higinbotham, be con-
tinued, the same old squalid medley will arise.
Even now the Minister for Education threatens
to bring forward an ignored Act of Charles 11.,
put a patch on it. and use it for every-day wear.
In the Vic. Electoral Act of the sixties the
principle of secret vote by ballot was “acciden-
tally ” abolished, and woman-suffrage granted.
Higinbotham discovered the fact, and woman-
suffrage was hurriedly annulled, though the resti-
tution of the secret ballot was violently opposed.
G. H. Reid is perhaps the first Australian
Premier who, within his first nine months of
office, has been attacked by pamphlet by poli-
tical opponents— ex-Premier Parkes on the one
hand and “John English ” (Norton) on the other
having almost simultaneously broken out into this
special form of press warfare.
Civilisation moves, even if very slowly, at
Botany Bay. Ex Justice-Minister O’Connor now
proposes that the lowest limit of age at which
offenders shall be liable to a whipping shall be
raised from 12 to 18 years. A year or two ago, at
Botany Bay, they actually hanged four youths,
two of whom were under 18 years !
The Victorian military authorities were
anxious to send an officer to take part in the
Chitral war, in order to study the art of mowing
down niggers, but the Governor-General of India
refused to meet the proposal. The anxiety of the
Australian warrior to kill something is growing
beyond restraint. Give war in our time, O Lord !
Moreton Frewen may congratulate him-
self on the venomous and mendacious attacks
made upon him daily by the Argus. Advocates
of the gold-standard would be seriously com-
promised if the paper had anything like its old
standing. As it is, the Tory monoinetallists of
Melb. stand aghast at the indecency in this matter
of the once-saored paper.
South Australia intends saving £2OOO a
year by having its loans inscribed at the Agent-
General’s office. The process of “ inscription ”
consists in keeping a register of stockholders in a
big book, and the practice of paying a bank to do
this simple piece of clerical work is another of the
holes through which Australia’s money drops
into space.
H. H. Champion on parties in Vic. :—“ So
far as I can see, there is an enthusiastic minority
hero, whose main idea of politics consists of the
need for the defence of property, whdst the
majority, upon whom rests the whole political
power, are prepared to endorse any application of
Socialism for which reasonable arguments can be
brought forward.” '
The free and almost-free systems of State
education in Australia have materially operated to
reduce the salaries of teachers employed in private
schools, and now the fact that the salaries of these
latter have been so reduced is presented by
retrenching committees as ample reason for reduc-
ing the salaries of public school teachers. Thus
do economics see-saw.
M‘Pherson, M.P., chairman of S.A.
Labor-party, is sad because scores of working
women in the city constituencies have declined
even to accept service of the forms for registering
their votes under the Adult Suffrage Act. They
are evidently suspicious that the innocent blue
paper is some mysterious but infernal machine.
Parkes’ appearance on Sydney temperance
platform the other night recalls William Forster’s
lampoon on Gov. Gipps of 50 years ago. The
“ Devil ” says :
. . . Such is the general spread of sobriety.
They’ve got up in Hell a temp’ranee society,
And I make it a rule, though much trouble it brings,
To patronise always all these sorts of things.
Maoriland has closed the year with a sur-
plus of £400,000, and transfers £250,000 to the
Public Works Fund. As the Argus cordially
assures us, democratic Government is ruining
Maoriland, and capital is being driven out of the
country, and the only possible result is disaster.
Meanwhile, Maoriland is the only province in
Australasia which has a consistent balance on the
right side of the ledger.
One of the happiest typographical errors
(if it was an error) ever perpetrated occurred in
the now-defunct Melb. Evening Standard, when
four columns of Patterson’s Castlemaine speech
were adorned with his portrait and six cross-heads,
the first two of » hich ran.:—
Sir James Patterson at Castlemaine.
A Plain Sneaking Premier.
fhe dregs of the Vic. Conservative great
’94 rally having settled down into the Reform
Club, numerous absurd persons take the oppor-
tunity to earn undying fame. One Banbury
Geoghegan rises to affirm that payment of mem-
bers is illegal iu Vic., and that Victorians suffer
very much from ignorance of political economy
and the absence of intellectual honesty. This is
rather severe on the Reform Club.
It is futile to expect the public to remem-
ber what a strike is about. The public judges the
cause by the after-conduct of a few men —the
worst-behaved men in the crowd —or by a re-
porter's account of it. The “ horrible outrage ’’ is
remembered; the merits of the dispute are for-
gotten, if they are ever known. This was notably
KINDRED
SOULS.
TRAVELLER (who

“ I suppose that

ing here for the
sake of food and
shelter. ”
SQUATTER (wearily):
“ Yes; I expect

errand as your-
self."
the experience of the Broken Hill miners. Public
sympathy with strikers, if based only on a report
of the merits of a dispute, cannot, therefore,
reasonably be expected to be worth much.
The N.S.W. Local Government Bill mud-
dles along. Tiie rating clause, after sundry
amendments, now reads that if rates are levied on
the unimproved value of land they may range
from 11. to in the £, and, if on the annual
rental value, from fid. to Is. in the £. Tuerefore,
pi one case the unimproved value of land is set
down as equal to 24 years’ rent; in the other it is
equal to 10 years’ rent. Which is just as absurd
as to enact that G. H. Reid must stand 24 yards
away from Henry Parkas, while Henry Parkes
must be only Ifi yards away from G. H. Reid.
The N.S.W. Compulsory Conciliation Act
commences: —“When in any industrial district
either party to a dispute or claim has,’’ &c. Pro-
bably the slipshod Government didn’t notice it,
but this clause is so vague and far-reaching that
if a fellow has a dispute with his best girl’s father
about his right to mash her over the back fence
every night, he can haul the old man before the
court to be conciliated. Also we may expect to
hear in the same court from the lady who claims
that her husband should get up and kindle the fire
in the morning.
After a judicious silence of some years,
the kindly old Dr. Ross, M.P. (Molong, N.S.W.),
broke his rhetorical fast in the Assembly the oilier
evening. The doctor is afflicted with the “as-it-
were ” malady. He cannot finish a sentence
without the superfluity. Once in the dim long
ago he spoke for 30 minutes on an amendment to
Tom Garrett’s Land Bill, and introduced “ as-it-
were ” 200 times—according to a gallery liar—
winding up with : “ I will, as it were, vote for the
amendment.” The doctor’s next speech is due
about 1002.
M.L. Midland Railway arbitration is post-
poned for the present, apparently because the
arbitrators, Clias. Lilley and Bruce Burnside,
can’t get a local umpire with a “ Sir ” to his name.
There are many qualified “Misters;” but “the
arbitrators insist on an umpire of equal rank with
themselves.” So an effort is to be made to get
“Sir ” Robert Herbert out from England. “Sir ”
Charles Lilley, by the by, is the person who
waved a furiously Democratic flag at last Q.
elections, and whose name was bunched with
L ibor-leader Glassey’s as a candidate for N. Bris-
bane.
Let there be no mistake about this matter.
The question before the N.S.W. public is now
not whether Dean, under death-sentence for the
alleged poisoning of his wife at North Shore,
Sydney, is guilty or innocent, but ivhether he had
a proper trial. If he has not had a proper trial,
according to the letter and the spirit of the law
(and public opinion is unanimous that Dean’s trial
was a mockery and a farce), then the Executive is
not empowered to re-try the prisoner or cobble-up
the obvious deficiencies of judge and jury. Dean
is morally entitled to a new Supreme Court trial.
If he cannot legally be given a new Supreme
Court trial, then he is entitled to be released—no
matter what anybody may think as to his guilt.
For the Australian Parliaments to assent
to Australia having direct judicial representation
on the British Privy Council means the Machia-
vellian enactment of Imperial Federation. The
Australian Republic need fear no kings—kings are
not created in any country nowadays. Any pro-
posal to create a Royal family in America or Aus-
tralia would stiike 999 voters out of 1000 as more
ludicrous than the grotesquest gibherings of a
lunatic asylum. As they cannot set up a king in
Australia, Imperialists seek to gain their ends
through the Law, the only acknowledged or
possible king in our nascent Republic. Let Aus-
tral! m voters lie ware—the Privy Council job is
far advanced, and the political windpipe of the
nation is in the lingers of greedy, ambitious and
unpatriotic lawyers.
The endowment clauses of N.S.W. Local
Govt. Bill, providing that the State shall subsi-
dise th ‘ to-be-created shires, &c., at various rates
up to £3 per annum, for various periods up to 30
years pissed the Assembly without division. If
these clauses are not amended before the Bill
becomes law it is almost certain that they will
have to be cancelled afterwards. Fixed subsidy
proved an intolerable burden in Queensland,
where divisional boards and municipalities now
get endowment in proportion to the cash the
Govt, has at disposal every year—the coat being
sensibly cut from time to time according to the
cloth. But perhaps the Govt, idea was to bribe
members heavily to pass the measure, and trust
to chance for an opportunity to withdraw the
bribe later on.
THE NEW WOMAN.
The New Woman’s eyes rested upon the
patient figure of her husband emptying the after-
dinner debris into the ash-barrel, her heart smote
her.
“Dearest.”
He started timidly, seemingly disconcerted by
her unwonted manner.
“ Dearest, ’’she repeated, “this cake is better
than mother used to make.”
He was silent, but, as he finished washing the
dishes, and proceeded to sew a button on her
knickers, a glad smile irradiated his countenance
A kindly word had lifted his burden.- —Amer.
The Coroners’ Courts Bill (read a second
time in N.S.W. Council, last week), the chief point
of which is the abolition of coroners’ juries,
has much to say for itself when taken on its
merits. But when it reaches the Assembly it will
suffer from coming at a time when there appears
to be a strong desire among certain sections to
belittle juries of all sorts. It is argued impres-
sively in support of the Bill that the abolition of
coroners’ juries will save the country .£3OOO pet
annum, but to those who are influenced by that
argument the abolition of all juries must be a
mere Question of time—and then the late Alfred
Stephen’s idea of proper law-administration will
be realised. On the whole, let N.S.W. keep
coroners’ juries for a while. They are stupid,
maybe; but it is easier to “ square ” one man than
twelve.
Premier Kingston, in his famous letter to
Premier Turner, alluded to the “selfish” and
“ungenerous” Protective policy of Victoria.
Whereupon Turner replied that Protection was a
selfish policy, intended solely to benefit the
country which adopted it, and asked if Preetrade
wasn’t intended for the same selfish object and no
other. Freetraders always talk of the “selfish-
ness” of Protection. Will any one of them who
is running for Parliament tell his constituents that
he advocates Freetrade because it will do a lot of
good to other countries at his country’s expense.
No ! The only object of every fiscal policy
is to help along one’s own country, at the expense of
every other one if need be. Protectionists admit
that their policy is utterly and brutally selfish.
Why doesn’t the other party stop snuffling and da
likewise ?
While Mr. Dick Draco O’Connor, N.S.W.
Justice Minister, is at work, he had better
add a clause to his Disorderly Conduct Bill
expressly providing in so many words that the
wearing of a belltopper and a black coat,
or the possession of a nice, scented, silken-
dad mother and fashionable sisters, shall not be
sufficient to prevent an otherwise fluggable person
from being flogged. So far as is known by
“society,” no “decently-connected’’ man has
ever been flogged in N.S.W. or in Australasia. If
Mr. O’Connor won’t look after this urgently-
needed provision, perhaps somebody in the Lower
House will attend to the matter. The lash for the
man in workman’s garb —and for his son ! If there
are any democratic members in N.S.W. Assembly
they should combine and die of exhaustion on the
floor of the House rather than allow Mr. Dick
O’Connor’s Bill to disgrace the Statute-book.

FLETCHER’S PILLS and CLEMENTS
TONIC are the recognised household remedies of
the Australian colonies, and every designing
quack tries to trade on their reputation and re-
nown. This is the greatest proof of their merit,
and sufferers want to be particular to get the
genuine articles, as regret and disappointment are
sure to follow the use of the thousands of “All-
failing” remedies so freely advertised. The repu-
tation and wide-spread use of Clements Tonic and
Fletcher’s Pills are the greatest proofs of their
appreciation by the public.- If they were not as
represented they would have passed out of memory
long ere this; but instead their sale is greater and
they are more esteemed day by day and week by
week, and this emphatically proves their undis-
puted supremacy. Listen to no argument from
interested parties ; demand the genuine articles
and TAKE NO SUBSTITUTE.
The name of the last discovered Brisbane

The odours of that smelly Melbourne

Monkhouse, of the Gaiety co., presents a striking
likeness to “Toby ” Barton.
“ Pretty Ethel Haydon is the latest sufferer from the
zeal of injudicious friends,” writes Tub Bulletin's London
correspondent. “She has been so paragraphed and
boomedXincltiding an interview by a Pall Mall Gazette
man) that everybody expected to find something in the
shape of a phenomenon. Alack-a-day ! the reality was far
from the ideal. She turns out to be a very- ordinary,
good-looking young lady, with a nice little voice and
nothing more. It must be admitted that she was exceed-
ingly nervous and had a had cold, hut it will take long to
wear off the effect of a disappointing first appearance. I
don’t think that, for the prese it at least. May Yoh6 need
trouble herself to he jealous, which she was quite pre-
pared to be had the fair Ethel come up to what her
boomers said of her. Still, we must Hide a wee ; and per-
haps a little later on your little Melb. favorite may justify
all that has been written about her.”
Deoima Moore says: “ Ttie Americans are very kind
people, but that- audiences are strange to an English
artist. They don’t see jokes. Their own jokes are all
about breaking chair-legs, and throwing towels, and that
kind of thing.” Decima is wrong. American jokes are
mostly about Weary Watkins, the tramp; and Brudder
Johnsing, the nigger, who stole a chicken and a water-
melon.
Cecil Hope, who is to be married to the captivating
Decima Moore a week after arrival “in Town,” resembles
the long cricketer Ford in lankiness, looks, and the haw-
haw-ness of his talk. He was an officer in the Gordon
Highlanders, doncherknow, before he took to the boards,
and but for this alteration in his career would have been
slaying Swats in the Chitral country at the present
moment. He has only been on the stage a year, and
Farquhar, the dashing miiitaire, is, so fir, his one
and only part. By the way, brother Arthur Hope,
who plays another officer in the “Gaiety Girl,” also
gravitated from the army (Scots Greys) to the stage. Add
t) this that G. C. Woodhouse was once in the 65th Regt.,
the beauteous Ryley in the navy, Fritz Rimma in The
Hungarian army, and manager Malone in the Cape
Mounted Police, and you get a warlike set of mummers.
Charles Ryley had an operation performed upon him in
America, and was carried on board the el.amer when
leaving Frisco. The voyage pulled him together again,
but Melbourne notes sadly that he has aged more than
his brief absence should justify.
Mrs. Violet Varley-Tapley has “ signed on ” again with
W. &M. Her re-engagement begins in June, in a brand-
new comic opera. With the exception of this delightful
little lady, all the stars of the old co. will have disap-
peared, but " the Firm ” intends to bring out from London
some artists to fill the gaps.
That lost Gilbert ian opera, “ Ruddigore,” is to be pro-
duced some time in May, by a company of swell amateurs,
at Wellington (M.L.). This is said to be its first appear-
ance in Australasia. Now that Gilbert is on the wane,
and new operas like “ lolanthe ” and the “ Mikado ” are
no longer forthcoming, why doesn’t the Firm produce
“Ruddigore?” It may he poor stuff for the old Gilbert,
but it would probably he better than anything that can
be obtained from the present Gilbert or his contem-
poraries.

Dear Bulletin,—ln Sydney Daily Telegraph of Satur-
day last, re Charles Packer’s “Crown of Thorns,” it is
stated that “ the Sydney Philhmnonic Society is entitled
to the credit of having given the work for the first time
with full choral and orchestral effects.” This is abso-
lutely incorrect; for it was one of the six oratorios pro-
duced in the Garden Palace while the Exhibition was in
full swing, and was then performed under the conductor-
ship of the gifted composer himself. I took part
on the occasion, in a quintette for ladies’ voices, which we
had to read from corrected manuscript. By-the-bye,
what has become of the same composer's other oratorio’
“David,” and why is that not produced?—Yours, B. A.’

Melb. Royal, on the night of Marie E ster’s benefit,
bristled with lawyers and barristers and their family con-
nections. The dress-circle reminded one of Sydney harbor
—it was so full of sharks. Mr. Marie Klst-r, n 6 Larnach,
had a Maoriland Judge for hi* father, hence this awful
rally of the monsters of the deep.
Monkhouse, and other old hands of the new Gaiety
crowd, confessed thems-lves puzzled by Harry Rickards’
variety show at Melbourne Opera House. They looked
at Ihe names on the programme, considered the scale of
admission charges (from sixpence to a florin), asked for
friend ’Arry’s reassurance that the programme was faith-
fully carried out, and then shrugged their shoulder*.
They didn’t see how he could possibly do it at the price,
there and in Sydney. Nevertheless, Rickards does it, and
prospers.
Beryl Faber is the daughter of a doctor at Brighton
(Eng.).
Decima Moore and Beryl Faber, of the B. and B. Co.,

Olga Nethersole was governess for 18 months to Mr*.
Arthur Dacre’s (Miss Amy Roselle's) children before she
went on the stage in England. Miss Nethersole owes a
lot to Mrs. Dacre’s encouragement and recognition of her
talents at that time.
Modest, selfish Melbourne again! A “night” was
given by a man's club, chiefly composed of shipping,
clerks, at a well-known Melb. music-hall, at which no
ladies were admitted. This was expressly printed on ail
the tickets sold. Yet there were 20 extra beautiful
damsels engaged for the occasion.
A charming little side-scene was enacted at the first
performance of “H.M.S. Pinafore,” at Melb. Princess’s,
which the public gathered there did not see. One of the
rival prima-donnas (the lively one) was watching the
other (the quiet one) from the wings, and
she suddenly fell over a soap-box a soene-shifter had
left in the way. People on the Block, next morning,
wondered how the bright little woman had come by her
black eye.
Handsome Edna Grace, who came with “Morocco
Bound,” returned to England by the Ooeana last Satur-
day, after a most unpleasant time, in no wise of her own
making, in Australia.
The beauteous Rathbone sisters (who leave for England
in about three weeks’ time) journeyed to Adelaide on
Wednesday week along with “The New Boy” and their
tableaux properties, to gladden the hearts of the Holier
City johnnies. Their departure leaves an aching void in
the breasts of their Melbourne admirers, which even the
new Gaiety girls will not easily fill.
The “ Gaiety Girl ’’is about the first play to do away
with the odious system ol star parts. The author has
recognised the good old principle of share and share
alike, and everybody, from the £6O a week man down to
the humble tenner, gets an equal show. Also, the low
comedian has been laid in his grave.
Frank Stayton, whose amusing pourtrayal of the inane
dude was one of the bright spots in “Morocco Bound,”
goes t» England. He has latterly been playing at
Melb. Bijou with W. & M. Young Stayton had a
tempting offer from Arnold to play the name-part in
“ Charley’s Aunt," vice Ssagar, who intended returning
to England (a big compliment to him, by the way, as he
is only 20 years of age), but he had to decline owing to a

THE HISTORY OF A SCAR.
On the back if ray right hand—just about the
middle of it—there is a small scar, half as big as
a threepenny piece perhaps. You would never
notice it unless I showed it to you, and even then
you would have to look sharp to see it. But it’s
there, all the same, and will be until t e hand is
returned to dust. It dates back forty years, that
scar does. Going home from school one day
another boy and I quarrelled and fought. Strange
to say, it wasn’t about a girl either. Anyway he
drew his jack-knife and stabbed me in the back of
the right hand. The wound, I remember, was
slow to heal. It was sore and inflamed for months,
and hardly a day passed but something hit it, or I
knocked it against something, and so made it
worse. My whole available body appeared to be
concentrated in that sore. You know how such
things are. They are like boils, and if th ire is any
comfortable spot to have a boil there are loads of
money waiting for the fellow who discovers it.
Lately we have received two letters, both con-
taining an identical expression, namely, this :
“Everything seemed a trouble to me.” Now, none
of us are so tough as to be proof against trouble,
but when everything is a trouble to a man the very
heart inside of him must be tender and touchy.
And, mercy knows, it is so often enough. Grief
will do it, worry will do it, and illness too.
One of these letters, or, at least, the writer of it,
goes on to say:—“lt was in March, 1880, that I
felt tired and languid, and without my usual
energy. Before that I had always been strong
and active. Now I was low-spirited and melan-
choly ; everything seemed a trouble to me. At
first I had a bad taste in the mouth, a poor
appetite, and all I ate gave me great pain in th©
chest and sides. Even fish and poultry gave ra©
as much distress as more solid food. I was
constantly spitting up a sour, acid fluid which
caused a miserable feeling in my throat and
mouth.
“After I had been for some time in this con-
dition I was attacked with gout in my hands and
feet, which confined me to the house now and
again for a week or two at a time. The parts
became inflamed and swollen, and gave me excru-
ciating agony. I could not bear anything to touch
them. For four years I was subject to these
attacks. The doctor who attended me was able
to ease me temporarily, but I was soon as bad as
ever.
“In the middle of April, 1888, I read that cases
like mine had been cured by Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup, and I thought I would try it. I hadn’t
taken more than half a bottle when I felt relieved.
This encouraged me to keep on with the Syrup,
and in a comparatively short time all symptoms of
th© disease left me. Since then I have enjoyed
excellent health, and whenever I feel a twinge of
my old enemy a dose or two of Mother Seigel
soon sets me right.—Yours truly, (Signed) M.
Leahy, 49 Grosvenor Terrace, Grosvenor Park,
Camberwell, London, September 22nd, 1892.’’
So much for the facts as Mr. Leahy felt them.
What has science to offer in explanation of them ?
This. Gout, rheumatism, and biliousness are three
complaints arising indirectly from an overworked
liver, or, more properly, from indigestion and
dyspepsia. The poisons so engendered may lie
hidden and unfelt for a long time, and then b©
suddenly rendered active by mental worry,
exposure, over eating, wrong eating, or any of a
dozen other causes. The kidneys fail (following
the stomach and liver), the acid poison remains in
the blood and sets up inflammation in the joints,
and the retained fluids produce dropsy. All sorts
of disturbances are apt to go with this condition
of things, every one less a disease in itself than a
symptom of the one cause— indigestion and
dyspepsia. The heart and lungs are often attacked
in sympathy. Cure the torpid digestion, and an
all round improvement at once succeeds. To do
this is in the power of Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup—as, perhaps, in the power of nothing else.
It was most unfortunate that this gentleman
suffered for eight years; and no wonder, mean-
while, that his mind was sensitive as his body to
every approach. Knowing what he now knows he
feels safe. There is no darkness hut ignorance, and
the German Nurse shows “ The way out.”

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
In the Ladies’ Hunting contest at Sydney
Agricultural Show, the two Victorians, Miss Eaiuey and
her chestnut, Fairfield, understand! rig each other, went for
the fences together with resolute dash. The judges and
the crowd awarded them first-prize. A horse feels him-
self a performer when he looks back over the past three
years and sees himself winning 100 first prizes for jump-
ing in Victoria and N.S.W. Fairfield gained first-prize
for 13st. hunters at the Melb. Show 7 last August. Miss
Rainey was reared among horses on a station, has sat
many a buck-jumper and can sit one now ; she thinks that
in rough riding a woman has far more purchase on her
saddle than a man has in his. She has never been thrown
by a buck-jumper, but beginning at six years old she had
many a harmless “buster” one way or another till she
became an accomplished rider in her teens. She has
never had an accident in public ; her last accident was
four years*ago, on the road to the Junee Show, when her
horse (not Fairfield) bolted with her, and, falling, threw
her with such force that she was picked up unconscious,
and remained so for seven hours.
Fairfield must have much respect for Miss
Rainey when he remembers that she was the first woman
to ride him, and that when she did so, last October twelve
months, she look first prizes in Victoria at Rutherglen,
Renalla, Bendigo and Shepparton ; that last March she
divided first prize at Gundagai, and that the only lime
they were unsuccessful together was at Cootamundra,
when she wouldn’t ride him at the little clothes-horse
hurdles, and took him off the field because ttie timid
authorities wouldn’t give them a stiff fence to go at.
Miss Rainey rode Fairfield three times last June with the
Melbourne hounds; the second time she was the only
lady who followed the hunt right through ; and the third
time, at the start, she went to the front and stayed there.
Miss Weston, who competed in the ladies’
jumping prize at Sydney Show, is a daughter of Captain
Weston, the founder of the Illawarra Cavalry. Captain
Weston is about 60 years old, but he hasn’t given up the
hunter yet. Miss Fletcher, who came second to Miss
Rainey, of Victoria, in the Ladies’ Hunting contest, comes
from Inverell, aiid is the daughter of a squatter. Sire
rode Anyhow, a horse belonging to Mr. Ernest Winter,
the enthusiastic Brisbane sportsman. Mrs. Elliot, another
Illawarra lady, who appeared for the first time on the
Sydney Show Ground, is the daughter of one farmer and
the w'ite of another.
Mrs. Brown, who won the N.S.W- Agricultural
Society’s special prize for best equestrienne and parade
riding, is one of the Woodlionses of Mount Gilead, and
the wife of a N.S.W. railway official. Mrs. Peck, who won
this competition last year and came second this year,
always ties Mrs. Brown for fir-t prize in the Illawarra
district shows. Mrs. Peck is a farmer’s daughter and the
wife of a State-school teacher.
Miss Carberry, whose name is familiar to
habitues of the Sydney Agricultural Shows, is one of the
bravest and safest riders in N.S.W. When she was but
14 years old a horse she rode bolted madly with her,
jumping over a buggy in his course, but the girl hung on
and ultimately drew him in.
In the 13-sfcone Hunters’ Contest, at Sydney,
Mr. Lindsay, from Illawarra, fairly raced Cardigan 11.
over the fences without once tapping. Mr. Lindsay did
not even get commended, for the reason that “ a
hnrse that races over fences is not the horse that a wise
hunter cares to follow the hounds on.” All the same, a
hunter should be able to take his leaps at speed. Many
so-called hunters are simply hurdlers—right enough to
jump if you give them time, but hopelessly lost when
after a quarry. The prize hunter on a show-ground is
generally the last at the death.
» ♦ * *
At the Show on Monday the jumping-ground
was saturated with rain, so that the hoofs of a good-sized
horse, standing still upon it, hurled themselves an inch
deep ; and though the least wet spot w as selected for the
High Jump, a horse, briskly cantering up to the fence,
drove hi-< hoofs, at times, three inches into the spongy
turf. Where the horses took off they cut the grass
away in strips. But heavy and dangerous as the
going was, one lady, Mrs. Peck, entered the contest and
jumped as high as sft. Sin. At the last there were only
(wo competitors left in, while the rest of the original 12
watched. Dunhey, a professional Sydney jockey, riding
Brigalow, put up 6ft, 9in. ; Matilda, ridden by Wheatley,
a rough rider from Tenterfteld station, N.S.W., tried this
jump three times and failed. “ She’s mine,” said Dunhey.
He had just escaped being killed in the early part of the
contest.
One veteran Australian sportsman, after seeing
Miss Rainey and Miss Fletcher ride over the hurdles, ex-
claimed : “ It is the finest jumping I ever saw; when I
die the pictures of those girls going over the hurdles will
be found graven on my heart.” In the equestrienne
contests Miss Taggart, of Maoriland, was at great dis-
advantage, for she had no horse of her own with her, and
was not familiar with the one lent her by Mrs. Peck.

Just as the solidly-wealtby, but (on the turf)
almost-consistenfcly 7 unlucky, Mr. “Bill” Long is trying
to dispose of his stud, Patroness (whose pa and ma—
Grand Flaneur and Olga—are among Mr. Long’s horses)
wins the Sydney Cap. The Devil’s whisper again: “Go
it, Bill Long, stick to your horses, old man,” Three-
year-olds have now w'on Sydney Cup 11 times in 29 years,
and only once lias an aged horse got home in that period.
Carbine’s 9st. is the biggest weight yet carried by a three-
year-old, and his time, 5.31, still stands as a record.
There is a general opinion tlia-t Cobbity might easily have
won Sydney Cup. He was a close third, but was in-
judiciously ridden. Yet his great long run from last
place was a brilliant effort. It was magnificent, but it
■wasn’t war.

Wallace’s run in the Champagne Stakes proves
him to be as game as a fighting-cook ; hut Bob Ray 7, who
beat him, is a good colt. Wallace certainly made all the
running, but it is questionable if he would have won had
he been ridden in the same manner as O’Brien’s son of
Welcome Jack. The Grand Flaneur-Olga family seem to
be all first-class stayers and finishers— bar Kuenalf, who
takes no notice of flail or spur when heads are turned for
home. Bradford (St. Leger-Woodnymph) is a stayer all
right, but failed in the Cup finish in the last dozen strides.

A Mongolian punter told a sad story to the
Flemington (Melb.) Bench the other day. He went to
some petty meeting with a Lillybuck-street commission
to back Soprano, and, in his simple heathen style, he
travelled round asking of the Chosen ones “ What plioe
Splano 7” Apparently the ingenuous Suey placed £6 10s.
on Splano with bookies who understood his language, but
the odd £2 was somehow credited to the wrong horse.
Suey 7 swore that he distinctly 7 said Splano, but the Hebrew
slapped Elaine on his ticket, which made a difb-renoe to
the backer when he came for his money. The B j nch dis-
missed a charge of larceny against the bookmaker—per-
haps partly because they felt certain that no Christian
jury would send a man to prison on a Chinaman’s oath
that his tongue drew a wide distinction between Soprano
and Elaine. Also, it was not quite certain that the sim-
ple Chow couldn’t read, and didn’t regard the Elaine
ticket as a mere clerical error which would enable him to
demand payment over either horse.

When an illustrious American card-player, now
in trouble in London, was in Australia, be well-nigh
cleared out the clever division before they “dropped.”
He arrived in an Australian city whilst there was a big
Jewish bazaar going on, where he soon became an object
of notoriety by spending money like water at the stalls.
Some Yiddisher gentlemen got him into a private room
and suggested nap. Stakes ran high, and “kitty” was
fairly running over, when a young lady came to the door
and called the new-comer to attend a raffle in which he
had entered. The cards had been dealt, and the sup-
posed softy, without looking at his hand, asked to be
excused for a moment—upon which a hand was “rung
in ” upon him and the pair of beauties whacked the pro-
ceeds. The nevvohum dropped between two and three
hundred before leaving, and next day the town fairly
rang with the news of the wealthy pigeon waiting to be
plunked. Next night a couple of big bookmaker-* got bold
of him, and some idea of Iheman’scouragemay be judged
from the fact that, he left off a full thousand to the bad.
And then he commenced to take a hand, and, before the
week was gone, had fairly cleaned out. the smarties. He
was a wonder with the “ brads.” and, after the cards had
gone a couple of rounds, could deal any hands he liked.
The oft-dished-up yarn about the ace of hearts
and four best clubs versus five clubs really occurred
between that Yank and the late Jack Thompson. Rumors
were flying round that things were not quite right, and,
in playing a game of single nap. with the ’Murkan, the
latter dealt Jack ace of hearts and four best clubs. “I’ll
go the lot,” said Jack, when the man from down East
offered to lay him a tenner he didn’t get through.
“Make it a hundred,” said Jack.” “Two it you like,”
said Ids Melioan friend, and the wager was made. The
Yank had dealt himself five clubs ; and when Thompson
led the heart, the Yankee was “ in the soup.”

Objects of the Company.
This Company is being formed for the purpose of establishing, as one of the staple
industries of this colony, the manufacture of pure grape brandy and genuine malt whisky,
and for carrying on the general business of a distiller.
The experience afforded by similar undertakings in England, Scotland and America,
proves that, under good management and favorable conditions, a distillery is a certain source
of wealth. In Great Britain and America, despite the keen competition that is ever to be
found in great industrial centres, the distilling of spirits has always proved a.highly profit-
able commercial investment. Distillers have founded great families, have lavished their
unbounded wealth upon schemes for the benefit of their fellow men, and, as employers of
labor, have secured and retained the confidence of their employes.
Such being the condition of this great branch of national commerce in the older
countries of the Northern Hemisphere, what reason is there why a similar success should
not be attained in tbs Australasian tninnies? The population is small by comparison, but
the field is virgin soil. The raw material is to be purchased in this colony at a lower price
than in Great Britain, Fiance «»r America ; skilled management and efficient labor are at
hind ; the spirit will be purer than is possible where competition is keen and the market is
ouen. Our Victorian neighbors have not been slow to grasp the possibilities of this branch
of comm rco, and in the sistef- colony distilleries have already been established with such a
measure of success that the future of the trade is well assured, whilst the cost of manu-
facture is so small that a pr >fitab e avenue for the sale of the spirit has been found by its
exportation to England, where it successfully competes with its rivals in a market hitherto
wedded to certain well-known brands.
Wh it has been carried out in Victoria may be emulated in this colony, and it is confi-
dently anticipated that this Company will be able to secure, not only the major portion of
the trade in N.S.W., but, from the superior advantages possessed by Sydney as a port of
shipment, to extend its business into other colonies, and to find a place in the markets of
the world.
The importation of spirits into this colony for the past eight years averages over
1,000,000 gallons per annum. Of (his quantity it may be estimated that 227,000 gallons
cons sts of brandy, and 478,0 0 gallons of whisky. In a distillery there are many sources
of revenue, but if this company can secure only one-fourth of the total above-mentioned
the success of the undertaking will be assured, and the shareholders will reap a rich return
for their investments.
Distillation of Crape Brandy.
In placing before the public the true position of this Company, account must be taken
of the extent of the raw materials required for the manufacture. In all parts of the world
the bulk of the brandy manufactured is distilled from grain. In plain terras, it is only a
grain spirit, colored and flavored. This Company will make no attempt to foist upon an
unwitting public any such spirit. In the distillation of brandy nothing will be employed
but grapes and wine, the spirit from which will possess the natural flavour and be infinitely
purer than what may be not inaptly termed an “artificial” product. There are in the
colony nearly 2000 vine-growers, who collectively grow over 6000 tons of grapes, besides
manufacturing over 1,000,000 gallons of wine annually. It is a fact needing no proof that
a large proportion of the grapes grown never reaches the market. Prices are reduced to
such a minimum that profit cannot be realised. Thousands of gallons of wine are annually
manufactured which are wholly unsaleable and uusuited for export. This Company provides
an outlet for both grape and wine, at prices which, in bulk quantities, would both prove
remunerative and offer an incentive to further production. Thus fresh avenues for the
employment of labor would be opened and a national benefit result. As has been already
stated, it is proposed to distil the brandy from wine products only, a fact which will, under
proper management, secure a class of spirit hitherto attainable in this colony only at an
expense quite beyond the means of the ordinary consumer. The distillation of a pure,
unadulterated, wholesome brandy from products grown in this colony is a great desidera-
tum. It will tend to decrease drunkenness, will advance the cause of morality, w ill open
wide fields for grape-growing, and provide work for a large percentage of the unemployed.
Malt Whisky.
A lar"e proportion of the whisky now imported into this colony is merely a grain product
as distinguished from a pure malt spirit. There has been found some difficulty in N.S.W.
in properly malting the barley required, but the site selected for the operations of the Com-
pany is admirably adapted for this purpose, and advantage will be taken of this opportunity
to distil a high-class whisky, superior in all respects to the bulk of imported spirits. At the
present time there are only 909 J acres under cultivation for barley, producing 92,000
bushels of grain. But, in addition, there is a large area sown with barley for feed purposes
alone. The estab’ishment of this d stillery will therefore afford an excellent market for
the grain and lead to the permanent cultivation of large areas at present unproductive.
Prospects of the Company.
Having in view the foregoing facts, this Company is offered to the public as a sound
commercial" 1 investment. The shareholders, bearing in mind the genuine success which has
been attained in Victoria, may, with the utmost confidence, anticipate a like measure of
prosperity, and the promoters have no hesitation in affirming that this will prove one of the
most remunerative investments for capital.
It is anticipated that in view of tin undoubted industrial advantages of this Company
as a means for the employment of labour, and the production of a spirit, pure and unadul-
terated, and of such a character as not to inflict injury upon the consumers, a proposition
for a differential excise will be placed before the Legislature. The encouragement of local
industries is a legiti nate function of (lie Government, and the promoters have every reason
to believe that a substantial concession will be made.
■ o
Site.
It is proposed to erect the Distillery Works on the Nepean River, where excellent
water is obtainable, and some 24 acres of land have been secured.
Machinery.
Most of the machinery will be constructed in Sydney, under the immediate supervision
of the Manager, who is Conversant with its construction in all details, with the latest
patented improvements. The cost will be much less, by some hundreds of pounds, than it
a complete plant were imported.
The Company's works will contain every acknowledged improvement known to science
for the production of the purest spirits at a minimum cost.
Management.
The services of Mr. A, Grcenwald, a practical manager of long experience and high
rep itation, have been secured. His report is annexed, and he gives it as his opinion that
the site selected is eminently suitable, being well supplied with permanent water, easily
accessible by rail, and otherwise well adapted for the purpose.
Mr. Adolph Gveenivald’s Report.
As to my experience as a practical distiller, I may state that I joined Messrs. Fraetelli,
Branca and Cie, of Milan, Italy, a year subsequent to the formation of that Company,
when the daily output was only 4( 0 gallons. By economical management and careful
treatment in the distillation, the production was increased in a brief period to 1600 gallons
a day. The firm was successfully floated into a limited liability company, with a capital of
£1,000,000, and most profitable returns to the shareholders.
One of the most important improvements introduced by me was the use of patent
machinery, which eliminated the fusel oil and higher alcohols during the process of distil-
lation. No chemicals were at any time used in the manufacture of the spirit, which was
thus essentially pure and unadulterated.
From my personal experience of many years, I am confident I can produce from the
machinery which 1 agree to erect—a fac simile of that employed by me in Italy—a high
class of spirit, equal to any now imported.

RABBIT
IWVA.SIOWI
Melbourne Agb of 12tli February, 1895, published the following’ telegram :
Albuby, Monday.—Good evidence is forthcoming that some recent bush fires in the northern part of Riverina
have been occasioned through the ignition of the phosphorus used for rabbit poisoning. A fire which is supposed to
have originated by this means destroyed over 30,000 acres of grass.
TOXA, the only scientific destroying specific, lias no inflammable constituents. TOXA WILL NOT
IGNITE, either spontaneously or otherwise. Horses, Cattle and Sheep WILL NOT EAT TOXA. This poison
is SAFE, EFFICACIOUS and CHEAP ; cheapness is incompatible with risk or uncertainty. Half-a-crown’s
worth of TOXA inis poisoned 550 Rabbits. While for particulars.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wiueglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Diver,
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Buchn Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of Lite Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retenfon or Inconvenience of U;hie, from
the loss of tone in the parts concernedin ils eiaeuali n.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia,in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Br.ch r on the human frame is more < ffleetnal on all
diseases of the Kidnejsand Bladder than any other herbal
plant ; and it also assists p. rsons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the steretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Med. cal men say about them
BJEKKIN, M.D. :—The B.tter is pure, and not like
others in oveidoses. Ithas a remarkable influence on the
liver, p emoting th ■ secretions if Bile, and correcting it
wlien d -langl'd, ai d restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costivene s.
D. ECKbXKOM, M.D.-8888-1 find tins' Utters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a ttimnla t to the liver, assisting i.igis-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend tlnm.
G. B. WOOD, W.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeiti a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen :
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
‘' That I feel it a duty 1 owe to the publi to
state that I have been sulfering for many years
from weakness of the. stomach, so called IN DI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt street.
Row’s You’ll Bo Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Ci niplainls. Cold, Coughs,
and geneial weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumh'er of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANET WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility, it’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-in vented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

“For the past 3 or 4 years, I have been a
freat sufferer from rheumatism and piles,
tried all sorts of medicines, but derived
no good from them. 1 chanced to read one
of your books and thought I would give
your Sarsaparilla a trial. I did so, and after
" >• w.
taking one bottle I felt better, and after
taking 4 bottles I was a new man. I was

The cl 'an, easy swing set by Enticottin stroking
the Yield ia'i champion eivflit (for tli— first time), the m her
day, should fo ce Ids claims to the stroke-ship of the Vic.
interprovincial eight. For the past four years Enticott
has probably been I he best stroke in Vic., hut he has, tor
some occult reason, been constantly overlooked both in
his own club and by the selection authorities in favor of
apparently inferior men. The fact that the Yarra crew
the other Saturday contained only one interprovinoial
oarsman, Chamley, while the straggly and palp fitly weak
opponents possessed no less than live of these presumably
superior rowing-men, is a ludicrous object-lesson in repre-
sentative crews. The win was, however, an empty honor
for the Yan a, for bad the Wend mree, last year's winners,
taken the trouble and gone to the expense of coining from
Ballarat, the race would inevitably have fallen to them.
Tne Warr. lam'tool club, also, judging by their ’93 showing,
would at least have run the Yana close.

“ I chanced across Peter Jackson at the Savage
Club, a few days ago, where he happened to call to see
Fred Bowyer, who is writing an entertainment for him
for the provinces,” remarks The Bulletin's London cor-
respondent per last mail. “ Peter tells me that he has
abandoned hope of bringing Pompadour Corbett to the
scratch, and he intends to run his little show for all it is
worth in England and then hie back to Australia, which
he looks upon with gratitude as his own country. I have
never seen the colored gentleman looking better, and all
the talk of his having aged, and so on, is mere bunkum.
He is just in nice trim to get to work, and he could be as
fit as ever he was in his life in a very short time. Though
I know he does not like to talk too much about himself, I
ventured to ask him how it came to pass that Corbett
managed to stand up against him for 60 rounds. All he
said was; ‘lam not going to make excuses. All I will
say is that I ought never to have been there. Draw your
own conclusions. The draw made Corbett, and he should
look upon me as his greatest, friend. He should take my
little pony and keep him all the rest of Ins days in clover
with a gold chain round his neck. That Corbett will
Stand up against me again I don’t believe,’ Nor does
anybody else, Jackson is very proud of the fact that in
’Frisco, Corbett's home, he, with all the prejudice of
color against him, is more popular than the gasconading
Yankee.”

Quong Tart, the popular Sydney Chinese trader,
has just become an officer of the local Cycling League,
en t when called upon for a speech, the other evening, he
sal > : “ He hoped the members of the league would act
ho torahly in their racing, and have no shinaniking.
(Laughter). If they raced straight out from the shoulder
they were bound to get on. (Yells). If they did this
they would knock cricket into a cocked hat. (Paralysis).”

An amateur-professional Northern bookmaker
recently had a “ wrong ’un ” for a pony-race given
to him by the “right people,” with malice afore-
fi night. Having told him to consider the pony
“in his bag,” they instructed certain private com-
missioners to hack it with him. The market price
was very short. One by one these commissioners
came along with an offer to take £2O to £lO about So-an-
d and in each case the odds-layer pressed his customers
to make it 40 to 20, ii.st ad of the lesser wager. They
were agreeable to this, so when the “dead” pony won
the race in a walk the betrayed sharp lost £2OO or more.
It was an awful experience for one who is of a nervous
temperament and acquainted with fits. In a dazed
State he returned to the hotel as soon as possible. He
needed rest for tiis troubled spirit. “My' head is so bad,”
said bookmaker Blank to the chambermaid, “and 1 must
get a long sleep; hut if I haven’t left ray room by half-
past nine to-morrow morning, mind you call me.” Sleep
wouldn’t come to the unhappy man for hours. The
thought of his rashness ill making it 40 to 20 every time
he was asked for £lO to a fiver against the accursed pony
kept him groaning between the sheets all night long.
After daybreak lie fell into a troubled doze, and half-past
nine o'clock had struck ere the chambermaid remembered
to thump at his bedroom door. “ Twnty to ten, Mr.
Blank,” sang out the damsel, “twenty to ten." Roused
into half consciousness, the bookmaker replied, “Makeit
40 to 20 ! ’’

A London Referee writer didn’t dissemble his
hope that the Englisiauen would win the final test-
m itch on their merits, or otherwise. “Never was I
humbug enough to subscribe to the conventional insincere
toast, ‘May the best man win.’ I go with it so far ns to
pray that our representatives may be the better or best
man on Ihe day. With that reservation, I can stand the
motto well enough ; but unless by best man my man is
understood, 1 count myself out.” Which expresses the
sentiment of partisanship all the world over. O Loard !
make our side as good as the other side, and give us a hit
of luck if necessary.
One of tlie moat successful of Australasian
spit l lei's began his career as “nose” for a quack doctor
more or less of the “clairvoyant” order, and to
his adroitness the “professional" success of his pal
was greatly due. It was the duty of the future turfite
to receive the patient, and intimate that Doctor So-and So
was not in but that he would return shortly. Then he
would artfully draw from the poor devil a statement of
his aches and pains—the “doctor” meanwhile listening
Unseen to the dialogue. When he had ascertained all he
wanted to know, the doctor, wearing his hat, wouli
hurriedly enter the room and shortly afterwards com-
pletely win the patient’s confidence by n surprisingly
accurate diagnosis. And so the precious pair made their
rise.

An old Melb. policeman, speaking of B aok
Perry, the pug, lately said ; “1 remember him well when
I was watchhouse-keeper. We used to have him in for
being drunk. When he had slept it off he would call and
a<k me what lie was in for. ‘Drunkenness! Thank God!’
he would say, ‘you know 1 was innocent over what I left
home for ’—and then he would cry like a child.”

The first—perhaps it whs also the last—horse-
race meeting was held at Suva, Fiji, some eight years
ago. The course was laid out on the heach. But as the
n tidies were coming up the straight (it look about five
rounds for tlie Cup distance), the tide advanc'd and
shifted the grandstand (which was a sugar-punt of large
dim nsions), tlie Judge’s hox (situate on tlie punt), and the
tote (on punt), about a hundred yards along the seaweed.
After tlie spectators, also tlie judge, stewards, and offi rials,
had been curried ashore on the cocoanutted hacks of the
highly-amused Fijians, there was such a terrible difference
of opinion as to which horse won—tlie punt having been
washed 100 yards past the post—that tlie machine refused
to pay out, the judge resigned and would not give a
decision, and the spectators swore so at tlie stewards for
not getting the race away in time for the tide-rise, that
for years no talk was heard of another race-meeting.
No man, save the one who uses Parson
Flaked Oatmeal, knows the full joy of life. Tli
two essentials of a peaceful existence are a good
digestion and a conscience which is as hard as tie
nether millstone—-it being supposed to be hardei
than the upper, millstone owing to the extra pres-
sure. Parsons’ Flaked Oatmeal supplies the good
digestion, and the hard conscience, in most cases,
arrives naturally. Also, a good digestion (which,
as already mentioned, can be acquired by the us<
of Parsons’Flaked Oatmeal) helps to supply the
kind of conscience required, for repentance is
mostly bile, and spiritual uneasiness generally
, arlses from dyspepsia. Therefore, the man who
i uses Parsons’ Flaked Oatmeal sleeps soundly, and
j his sins trouble him not, and the green andbiliom
nightmare never visits his pillow.
| The New South Wales Distillery Co.,
whose prospectus appears in another part of the
issue, is to be floated with a nominal capital ol
<£50,000, but expects to call up only £15,000. It
has a board of energetic business men who an
likely to give the new industry every possibh
chance of success. It has engaged an expert of
much_ experience to manage the distillery. Th<
machinery is to be_ made in Sydney, so that
the closest supervision may be exercised over
its construction. Also, the company’s plant
is to be of the newest design, and to contain
every improvement known. The works are to
be situated on the Nepean River, where one
of the finest and purest water supplies in Aus-
tralia is available ; and it is proposed to turn out
pure grape brandy and pure malt whisky only,
and to abjure all the cheap abominations of tin
import trade. Under these circumstances, the
co. starts with as good a prospect of success as
any such enterprise can possibly have.
N.S. W, Agricultural Society's show,
Moore Park, Sydney, was a brilliant succe* ,
splashed with mud. The Society, of course, is i t
responsible for the rnnd, but a few of the line -
ployed could have been given a broom and a
shilling each to sweep a few crossings on the slim, -
ground’s streets. One street was over ankle-deep
in yellow clay. The ground covers 25 acres; but
as some of the exhibitors last year tried to fill the
whole place up with their exhibits of agricultural
implements, windmills, &c., &c., the Society
charged for space this time at the rate of from 6d.
to 2s. per frontage foot. There were altogether 775
exhibitors, of whom 17 came from Victoria, two
from Bananaland, and one from South Australia.
Melbourne sent an unusual number of dogs, and
these were a special feature of the show ; one
Bananaland firm, Wood Brothers and Boyd,
Ripple Creek, Q., was the sole exhibitor in sugar ;
and the solitary South Australian, Hon. J. H.
Angaa, sent a small herd of- shorthorn, Hereford,
and Durham cattle, which, taking altogether one
special prize, three champion prizes, six first
prizes, and three second prizes, headed the list of
cattle-prize winners. Only one man, Mr. W. Y.
Cousins, Bebeah, Singleton, sent a wine exhibit,
20 entries, which secured first prize in each class,
with two special prizes. The total value of the
prizes amounted to about <£1500; of this .£330
were subscribed by 58 donors, Anthony Hordern
and Co. heading this list with <£9o. Among the
exhibits were 400 horses, 240 cattle, 120 pigs, 350
poultry, 120 pigeons, 150 canaries, 250 dogs.
There were 413 entries in farm produce; 40 In
hanging baskets, cut flowers, &c.; in food, pre-
serves and pickles, 125; in agricultural imple-
ments, 250; in machinery, 120; and in coach-
builders’ and wheelwrights’ work, 100. Pro-
duce, raw and manufactured, had 6> entries ;
furniture, 40; minerals, 10. The only State de-
partment that exhibited was the N.S.W.
Forestry Department, which had a better show
this year than previously.

Wrote Paul Bourget recently ; “ The
Americans never need feel dull, because they oan
put in their spare time asking who their grand-
fathers were.” To which replied Mark Twain;
“ The French oan turn in and endeavour to figure
out who their fathers were.” Max O’Rell, the
virtuous Gaul, who found so many unfaithful
wives in cabs with drawn blinds on Sydney South
Head-road, now challenges Twain to mortal
combat f< r insulting the mothers of France. But
the pen (Twain’s pen) is mightier than the sword.
The tobacco ami pipe industry in Sydney
has recently had much brilliance thrown upon the
subject by the 2000-candle power electric-light
which throws its effulgent gleams throughout
Mick Simmons’ new shop in George-st., near
King-st. The window has been set up regardless
of expense to form an attraction, and smokers and
non-smokers alike will find it worth while inspect-
ing for the sake of realising what can be done
with the pipe and weed. A new business move
which should pay good divs. is the keeping of a
first-class stock of sporting materials —chiefly
cricketing and tennis goods, boxing and fishing
materials, barbers’ requisites, cutlery and razors,
over which a Hamlet may soliloquise.
Barrister (to witness in the Melb. alleged
fraudulent gun-branding case); “Do you consider
yourself honest? ” Witness : “I am as honest as
I oan afford to be.” Barrister: “ Where do you
draw your honesty-lino ? ” Witness : “At keep-
ing out of gaol.” Well, that’s a good description
of current Melb. honesty.
The death of General Badeau, U.S., i*
cabled. He was long Grant’s right-hand man,
and published a fulsome biography of him a while
before Grant started to write his own, but there
oame a rift in the lute. Badeau advanced a claim
for helping Grant in the autobiog., and Grant
simply said “ Bosh 1 ”
Gov. Glasgow once visited a Maori feast
without being invited. He felt sorry he came,
after they had made him squat down and partake,
but there was no help for it —he could not slip out
without giving dire offence. In spite of the awful
dishes, he said, he could not help laughing at two
barefooted natives in black dress-coats and the
highest of white collars apeing waiters. These
two rushed from the feeders to the camp-pot,
yelling, “ Tyop return,” “ Tsooup one peese.”
The coming Governor of S.A. is described
as an evangelical churchman and an active phil-
anthropist, who has retired from the old brewery
business of Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co.
One of the Hanburys, if The Bulletin remembers
rightly, visited Australia a few years ago, and
he also was evangelical and philanthropic, and out
of sympathy with the beer trade. It looks as
though a temperance apostle must have sneaked
into the establishment of T.H.B. & Co. one foggy
morning—one of those Hinglish mornings when
even brewers get the blues—and converted the firm
at one swoop. Whereupon they turned their
hearts to religion and their business into a limited
company.

Blake’s Steam Pumps are the Best.
There are more Blake Pumps in use than there are of any other make, ami they have been adopted
by the largest Steam Engine and Steamship Builders in all countries, as well as by the Naval Depart-
ments of the English, United States and Russian Governments. The Blake Pump is in operation in
many town and city waterworks, iron, coal, silver and gold mines, and on the extensive pipes lines of
the oil regions of America and Russia. We claim “ the Blake Pump as the Standard Steam Pump,”
It having been fully recognised as such, as our extensive
and increasing sales testify. It has been pronounced by
mechanical experts and engineers to be the Best Steam
Pump, for the following reasons, viz.:
It is simple in construction !
It is positive under any pressure !
It is operated by the common l> slide valve !
It is durable and well arra> gecl in all its parts I
It is made from improved designs and new patterns!
It is made of the best materials, in the most workman-
like manner !
It is arranged with large valve areas, free water pas-
sages and large ports!
It will start at any point of stroke, and discharge the

“ Sydney Jephcofcfc,” so says a London cor-
respondent, who is looking after the book,
“ recently sold a few copies of his poems in
London,” and this after a long trial. S. Jeph-
cott (his “ Kisses,” by the way, is one of the most
charming sets of verses yet penned in Australia)
can’t therefore be arguing altogether from his
own experience when he advises Australian
authors to pack up their wares and take them to
London.
INDIA AND ENOS “FRUIT SALT.”—
“Dilbrughar, Upper Assam, India, Dear Sir, —
I desire to state the advantage which I, and I do
not doubt many others in this part of the world,
have derived from your ‘FRUIT SALT.’
Unlike other Saline Aperients, it is not lowering
in its action, though previous to its immediate
action it naturally causes great thirst. I have
used it on board ship in tropical latitudes, and
both there and here I can most honestly bear
witness to the fact that its use has warded off
fever over and over again. When taken in time
it is invaluable. As far as lam aware, it is
most popular in this part of North-Eastern Asiatic
India, and I consider that you are distinctly
entitled to this testimonial from me. I need not
add that it is wholly unrequested. I enclose ray
card, but from my extreme individual incon-
venienc j arising from publicity I do not wish my
name to appear, and merely subscribe myself,
most truly yours, ‘A Planter. ’ —J. C. Eno, Esq.,
‘Fruit Salt ’ Works, London, 5.8.” Sold by

The Boss says that you have three sheats of iron in the
account, but I never got three sheats, so none of
your larks. 1 only got two sheats. So for Christ
sake credit him that sheat in the next account. I only
got two, and why the do you go and put three
sheats in the bill, for do you want me to pay for the
thing? It’s strange that a fellow can’t go
and get tilings from you unless you drop it on like you
do putting things in that a fellow never got. I’ll take
my straight tip that you don’t do it any more.—
Yours, . You fellows wants a

Strinberg, the German philosopher, who
hates women like rats, points out that the rudi-

longer in women than in men, indicating her more

Anyhow, women have always had the reputation
of being the greatest tail-bearers.
A Trade Mark Case. —An important judg-
ment was given recently by Mr. Justice North,
who granted an injunction against the lessee of a
certain West-End restaurant, restraining him from
supplying in Lea and Perrins’ bottles any sauce
not made by that firm. The practice of refilling
the bottles of well-known makers with other than
the genuine article is too common in restaurants,
and the public will have to protect itself by asking
for the article by name, and informing the manu-
facturer in case an inferior article is substituted.*
In the New England (N.S. W.) district,
one day 20 odd years ago, a policeman, before
entering his house, pointed his rifle upwards and
fired at a cockatoo. The bullet travelled half-a-
mile without encountering any obstacle, although
the place (near Rocky River) is fairly wooded. A
woman saw her husband coming up from his work
and went to meet him. The spent bullet in fall-
ing struck her and she fell dead at her husband’s
feet. It was only after protracted enquiry that a
true solution of the mystery was arrived at.

FOURTEENTH REPORT.
Presented to the Shareholders at the ORDINARY GENERAL MEETING on 26th APRIL, 1895.
In submitting the annexed balance-sheet and statement of accounts to 30th March last, duly
audited and certified, the directors beg again to draw the attention of shareholders to the very strong
financial position in which the bank stands, with cash reserves amounting to thirty-five per cent, of
its liabilities. This .prudent policy, however, coupled with the low rates for money lately ruling, has
naturally militated against profits, although the bank s general liquid business has been fully sustained.
It is a great disappontment to the directors that the amendment of the Companies Act is not yet
passed, so that they are still unable to write the losses alluded to in previous reports off capital ; it is
reasonable to assume, however, that legislation so urgently and generally called for will be dealt with
at an early period, as promised by the Government, after which the directors hope to be able to resume
paying dividends, which in the meantime cannot be legally done.
The directors propose, therefore, to carry forward the balance.at credit of profit and loss account,
amounting to =£15,339 13s. 10d., inclusive of =£13,202 19s. 7d. brought from last half-year.
By order of the board.

treated free on the public platform, on crutches,
bath chairs, sticks, &c., must be seated in the
above hall by 6 p.m., to avoid the crush, and to be

monstrations only, and admission will be free to
such Patients.

It is the only rational application of Curative
Electricity to the Human System, for diseases of
Man and Woman, Deafness, Sight, Throat, Voice,

PROFESSOR RICKARD, M.E.
Professor Richard and his departure by yester-
day’s steamer. —Of Professor Richard it may be
truly said, “ He came, he saw, and he conquered,”
among the conquered being the highest in the
land, the Governor of the Colony, Her Majesty’s
Ministers in Victoria, and many of Her Majesty's
Colonial Lords and Commons.
He has proved himself a man of wonderful force
of character, extraordinary power of penetration,
and as keen a student of human nature as the
world has ever been confronted with. It is such
men as he who make history when their talents
are directed into the proper channel.
To Persons desiring Professor Richard’s Ser-
vices.—The Professor will use his own discretion
as to Fees for Private Electric Treatment.
Patients are not advised by correspondence.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than
any I have hitherto used, besides being free from

sprayed into the throat.
“It is very palatable when taken internally,

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
" It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
• Bengers Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he aide to
rear her. We took her tothe
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended * Benger's
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would he
used."
When N.S.W. Justice Minister A, J. Gag-
Gould visited Waloha the other day he was pre-
sented, with an address by the local school-children,
who did the Maypole dance for him and addressed
him as “the flight Honorable A. J. Gould.”
They expressed a hope that “when the Right Honor-
ahlegentlemannext visited WalehatheQueen of the
Maypole would be able, through the development
of the local mining industry, to wear a crown of
pure gold, won from the earth by means of the
prospecting-battery.” By that time, too, the
obstreperous drunk in Walcha “jug” may be able
to wear a golden gag instead of the common
nickel-plated article now fathered by G.G.
At a celebrated English biscuit-tactory the
average rate of wages is two pounds a week. One
pound in money and the other pound in broken
biscuits. The opulent firm wisely assumes that
an employe who has to support a family on 20s.
a week would like to sell the pound of biscuits and
buy cat's-meat for the children with the money.
Therefore, in the best interests of the firm, the
goods are carefully broken before being distri-
buted. Crumbs!

The Monthly Paper, issued by a Brigh-
ton (Melb.) ehuroh, publishes figures to prove that
Christian alms-giving is subject to atmospherical
influences. On January 10th the sum of
=£9 17s. lOd. was collected from 35 communicants,
but on January 17th, when Communion was en-
joyed by 57 souls, the offertory fell with a sicken-
ing thud to .£5 4s. 4d. An asterisk against this
small amount explains, in a footnote, that
January 17th was “extremely hot.” It isn’t in-
tended to suggest “ warm, very warm ” in a satiri-
cal sense, although a sudden drop of forty per
c uit., and more, may have made things rather
sultry for the poor shepherd. The footnote afore-
said means that the church expects the average
contribution of communicants to melt under a
blazing sun. A high temperature doesn’t neces-
sarily keep true believers away from the taber-
nacle, but it reduces their individual offering
from about os. 7d. to something under two “ bob.”
And why is tbisjthus, dear friends? In extremely
hot weather the sinner’s dread of Sheol gets
blunted. He feels himself becoming acclimatised
to the Fire which burneth, and thinks that if he
can’t save his soul on the cheap he may as well let
it slide.

The announcement of Statist Hayter’s
death, in the Melb. evening paper, was headed,
“An Unconscious End.” Mortality is a very
ancient rule —“an old, old fashion,” as Dickens
observed —but the world hasn’t yet discovered
that it must expect to die unconsciously. Men
and women, outside of the medical profession, are
disposed to hug the delusion that they will “ pass
away ” with a stage-smile on their faces, or con-
clude with a beautiful death bed scene, like John
Wesley in the picture. A good many people have
a last request stored up in readiness for the last
moment, when they mean to produce it under
the' limelight. Death, as the doctor generally
finds it, is about the least romantic incident
in one’s commonplace career. We breathe
heavily for a few hours, say thirty, and in the
grey early morning, the dreariest of times for
doing anything, respiration breaks off in the
middle —click ! —we are just a little more dead
than before. in rare instances dues a worthy
performer make a striking stage exit from the
drama of life. The one certain means of achieving
a conscious end is to play Deeming, and get
hanged.

Dear Bulletin,—What sort of student of the human
form divine is he who says “ the Pattie Browns, the Vi
Varleys, the Florence Marriotts, and the Kate Barrys are
the real Venuses of the stage? ” Did Venus have a large,
round head, a bare apology for a neck, round shoulders,
or nubbly knees? The “critic" libels two of the ladies
(especially one of them) by comparison with the
others; and he should never discuss figures again.
For the matter of which, Fanny Liddiard and Mary
Weir could give points to the pick of the quartette.
Little women are almost invariably too big in the figure-
head in the first place. Also, Nature seldom gives them
classical necks without unduly abbrevnting their waists,
or legs. And, by the way, Nina Boucicault was the most
elegant petite creature that we have seen on the Austra-
lian stage for many years, as far as her skirts permitted
one to judge.—Yours, Grace Before Meat.
From a private letter (a lady’s) from London to a Bcl-
LETiN-man: “‘King Arthur,’ at the Lyceum, is utter
bosh, though everyone was adoring and saying how
beautiful everything was. But now, after a week s gush,
people are beginning to find flaws. You, straightforward
in art, would loathe the Burne-Jones influence. Well,
there is the same lack of backbone in Comyns (Jarr, and
none of Burne-Jones’ drawing, imagination, or feeling.
The characters could exchange words and no one would
be wiser. They are all 19th century people speaking in
mediaeval strains. Why they should talk 16th century
English more than 19th, or Celtic, or anything else, you
can’t make out. It reminded me of the Lady Sandy’s
twaddle in ‘A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.’
Irving is weighed down by his armor, and in regal robes
looks like an old granny. The god-like, blue-eyed, fair-
naired Arthur has been transformed by Mr. Irving and
Burne-Jones. He has turned into a rattlesnake out of
joint at the knees, his back is hunched, and he never
stands up one minute. Irving’s own grey hair flutters
around. Ellen Terry was a dream of loveliness. Cos-
tumes quite indescribable, both in color and for em-
Dr ildery. Forbes Robertson has sent most girls mad
with his lovely movements. He is lovely, like a
Perugino knight, but is not Launcelot. This is not
his fault, as the part is not Launcelot. He looks like a
saint from beginning to end. He stood up straight and
looked young, was got up young and kept his own short
hair. The prettiest moment was when Guinevere threw
herself into his arms in the wood under a natural arbor
of May flowers. Irving might have been grandpa. As a
series of wonderful pictures it was interesting. We were
on the stage till 2.30 afterwards. There were crowds of

Henrietta Watson was playing at Toole’s Theatre, in

Melb. Herald is extending itself on the subject
of oharity entertainments, screaming for balance-sheets
and full particulars of expenditure. The argument
that “ charity ” show gate-money is a public subscription
for the good cause will not bear investigation. Ninety
per cent, of the people who buy seats for Lord Yarmouth's
antics, or the ladies’ cricket-match, wouldn’t give six-
pence to the good causes which benefit thereby. Managers
of these variety exhibitions announce them as being in
aid of certain charities—simply that and nothing more.
The charities are aided if they get anything at all, and,
as a rule, they receive the thick end of the profits.
The manner in which juvenile theatrical companies are
worked down South was opportunely exposed in the hear-
ing of a Vic. court - case lately. Prosecutor, a
email boy who sang “ M'Gilligan’s Cat” and similar
choice ditties in one of these co.'s, sued his manager for
os. fid., wages due for five nights' performances. The
boy told the court that the co. had been taken 20 miles
out of town, and the troupe had to sleep on the stage all
night, and the girls had a cheerful time from daybreak,
“ taking fits outside.” For all this the youngsters re-
ceived nothing but glory. The probable result of this
will be the summary suppression of juvenile minstrel
companies —and a good Job for the Poverty Pointer. Even
C ummles is preferable to the infant prodigy.
Signora Majeroni is teaching Italian at the new Melb.
Conservatorium of Music at very low fees. Prof.
Marshall Hall, seeing that his new venture wasn’t likely
i,> pay at the fees first advertised, is running a lot of side
class's on the cheap. In this way he is doing his best to
lake the bread out of the mouths of a number of worthy
teachers. Unthinking people are caught by the idea of
belonging to the University. So the classes there are fill-
ing up, bub it remains to bo seen whether the teaching
won’t come down.
Tommy Hudson returns from India in May, re-opening
n Adelaide on May 24. His season in India beat all
rrevious records ; he showed in Calcutta for nine weeks
Sontinuously. Tommy says this is his last trip, as he in-
iends to settle in Adelaide, where he owns much pro-
perty.
A youth attached to a Melbourne paper tells how he
vas once sent down by his boss to a departing steamer
vith a summons for a handsom ■ lady star now glittering
n the States, but seeing her sitting on deck and looking
very mournful, he said, “ I’m d—d if I do.” And he re-
turned to town and swore he couldn’t find her.
When the “New Boy” was playing at Wellington,
Jenny Watt-Tanner one night came as usual to that part
where she throws herself despairingly on a couch and
wants to die and be out of her misery. The furniture-
man, however, hadn’t allowed for the lady’s size ; two
legs of the couch promptly gave way with a crash, and
the actress fell among the ruins. The show had to stop
for five minutes to let the audience give vent to its joy.
A little thing like that amuses an audience. Probably
the loudest roar that ever went up in Sydney Royal
was when an actress fell on the stage and her skirt came
off as she got up. And the next loudest roar was one
night recently, when Miss Vivienne was playing the
sorrowful heroine in “A Million of Money,” and a rat
about the size of a small cow insisted on walking round
her just as she was fainting in the centre of the stage.

At Nelson (M.L.), recently, the mission vessel Southern
Cross was exhibited to the public on Sunday at a charge
of 6d. per head. The church doesn’t mind in the least
desecrating the Sawbath with its own little gate-money

Melbournian asks: “ Did Mrs. Brough ever act bur-
lesque here? In London she was masher burglar in a
travesty of‘Silver King?’” She played the same char-
acter, in the travesty aforesaid, at Melb. Opera House.
Pinero’s imbroglio over the real Mrs. Ebbsmith is a
reminder how often authors have thus struck Buckley,
as it were, in jarring real individuals. Swift had to
apologise to a real much-travelled Captain Gulliver.
Dickens was surprised to find an actual Dombey and Son

Daniel Bandmann (now pork-raising in the U.S.) at a
club one night was explaining to an artist the kind of
poster he required, and, to emphasise his instructions, took
up a pencil, saying—“ Something like this. But there
you know I can’t draw.” H. J. Byron, who was standing
by, here chipped in with —“ That’s what all the managers
say, old chap.”
The managerial idea of a good press notice, expressed
by an extract from a Melb. paper, in the daily advt.: “ All
parts of the theatre were crowded, the dress-
circle in particular being overflowing with a fashionable
audience. The production was, in fact, a genuine suc-
cess.” The overflowing audience came to see a produc-
tion on spec., and, because the dress-circle nymphs were
fashionable and wore very little clothing, the performance
was a genuine success.
Hare comes to Australia for his health, as his son did.
Gilbert Hare did not act in Sydney or Melb., and Hare is

The London Pavilion Music Hall Co., Ltd., stands on
velvet. “In eight years,” said the chairman at the last
annual meeting, “ we have made sufficient profit to enable
us to pay off the whole of the capital, and we still have
an undivided profit of £11,150. £lO,OOO of that is re-
serve-fund, and the remainder is carried forward.” Tne
balance-sheet, declaring a 7 per cent, div., was cordially
accepted, and the meeting agreed with the chairman that
the time had come for cutting down the salaries of
music-hall artists. It was the Pav. that started fancy
prices for “stars” by paying Macdermott 625 a week for
singing“We don’t want to fight, but, by Jingo! if we
do,” at a time when other ’alls could only afford £l5, or less,
to that famous cockney patriot. Now that prices all round
are double as big as of yore, the Pav. is still apparently
paying more than its rivals, and may be compelled by a
combination of “leading talent” to continue the system.
A prosperous theatre - manager occasionally gets
“squeezed ” by one or two popular performers—ask W.
and M.—but he is not squeezed for long. A fashionable
music-hall manager, on the other hand, must have certain
people on his stage from time to time, because they are
attractions elsewhere and carry their successful shows
with them. Two or three ’alls are playing a certain num-
ber of pieces at the same time, so to speak, therefore the
’all that makes extra-large profits is considerably at the
mercy of “stars,” who may choose to combine in asking
something more than their ordinary fee for appearing
there.
The vestibule of Drury Lane Theatre has been adorned
with busts of Shakespeare and David Garrick for half a
century, more or less. They are reminiscences of the
days of the “legitimate,” when Old Drury was a serious-
minded playhouse, and the performers were described as
Her Majesty’s servants. Augustus Harris put a third
bust in the vestibule lately, to the intense disgust of
Garrick and the Divine Bard. The newcomer is Dan
Leno, variety artist. A queer triumvirate—Bill, Davy
and Dan.

Spagnoletti : “ Temporary insanity —of

comes round, in the cases of men and women who
are starved to suicide, in Melb., by failure to
obtain work for two years, or thereabouts. There
was one last week, a perfectly sensible man, who
didn’t know that suicide voided his special insur-
ance policy for his family. The case was almost
precisely on all fours with that of the poor
engineer, M‘Dunnell, a few weeks ago. Then
there was the chemist, Stokes, starved to arsenic,
or something, and not long afterwards his wife
flew to the same remedy. Temporary insanity !

The Vic. Railway Department recently
spent £3500 on cutting down the steep grades
between Korumburra and Oakleigh, and the con-
sequent saving in haulage expenses is .£2OOO per
annum. The old railway builders were a clumsy
and primitive race, and their Work has run these
provinces.into enormous expense. The Victorian
department is now busy cutting down a lot of
other awkward grades, and in every ease the work
promises to pay something like 50 per cent, per
annum on the outlay. If the N.H.W. Works
Committee would consent to the abolition of the
great Zig-zag, and would do something violent
with some of the awful banks and braes on the
Southern line, it would earn the thanks of the
community. Cutting down railway gradients is
the only railway work which pays nowadays.
The Australasian Keystone, in a recent
number, deals severely with one rather popular
form of Freemasonic meanness. “Misfortune,”
says the masonic organ, “may prevent a brother
from being able to pay ; then the lodge should
exercise its charity in resolving that for the past
arrears may be forgiven, or in the future Grand
Lodge dues may be paid for him till he is able to
recover himself. A brother who puts the lodge to
no other expense except Grand Lodge dues is on a
different footing to some who are two years in
arrears, yet eat and drink at the expense of the
financial members. Brethren should resign, then
dues stop; clearance granted by compromise.
Some brethren we should let down easy, others
drop with a bump ! ”
THE BUMP OF FRATERNITY.
If misfortune overtakes a precious brother
And moneys to the causa he cannot pay,
O the masons cry, “ Be kind to one another ! ”
Provided the defaulter stops away.
But if he still goes feeding on and boozing
At banquets, though he owes “a tidy lump,”
Then the members of the lodge he is abusing
Must drop their loving brother with a hump.
They may let the stony absentee down easy
Since he doesn’t seek refreshments on the cheap
Like the unflnanoial mason free and easy
Who banquets when he ought to be asleep.
His presence makes a solvent stummick sicken ;
He well might draw his liquor from the pump,
So the founders of the feast of fizz and chicken
Must drop such loving brothers with a hump.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
To Cigarette Smokers,
WE bog to inform our customers and cigarette
smokers generally that the : American
Tobacco Co., Ltd., of N.S. W., who control the
sale of cigarettes known under the brands oi
“Allen and Goiter's Straight-cut No. I,’
“Cameo,” and “Old Judge,” and who manufao
ture the colonial-made cigarettes called “Pure
Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official
notice that they will not supply us with any o\
their American-made cigarettes unless we agtefi
to relinquish the agency held by us for New South
Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W-
D. and H. O. Wills, Limited, the manufacturers
of those popular high-class Cigarettes known as
“ Three Castles ”
AND
“ Capstan.”
We have declined to conform with this request,
as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow
the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade.
We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to
try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles”
AND
“Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other.
We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles”
AND
“ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one
Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

IN ITS JUBILEE YEAR, 1893,
The Mutual Life Insurance Company of Mew York
DEVISED AND INTRODUCED TWO NEW PLANS ' SURANCE :
THE FIVE PER CENT. DEBENTURE POLICY
AND
THE CONTINUOUS INSTALMENT POLICY.
Under the first of these Policies, a person insured fur, say, .£5OOO could secure for a Beneficiary
payment of <£2so per Annum, or more, for 20 years after death of insured, and the full amount of
£5OOO, with possible Bonus additions, at the expiration <>f the period named.
Under the second of these Policies, a person insured for a similar amount could secure a yearly
income of <£2so for a Beneficiary during the latter’s survival, no matter to what age the life might
extend.
At the time of their introduction these Plans of Insurance were ridiculed hy representatives of
local offices. Now, they are being ostentatiously adopted under changed names, and with slight
modifications, which are the reverse of improvements.
The representative of the leading local office wrote, and printed, two years ago : “ We admit that
we have never'before seen them offered, but we think that it is due to the fact that there is a limit
to human credulity, and that not many people can be found to pay so high a price for so unattractive
a benefit.”
NOW he is offering them himself, under pretence that they are something now, and is charging a
higher price for them.
Before insuring elsewhere, examine carefully the Plans of Insurance devised and presented by
THE MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK,
which contain benefits and advantages that no office of inferior resources can parallel.

The Cooking of Kalampu.
[For THE BULLETIN.)
The terraced Bornean shore was fading into night,
and outside the pounding surf there was' oily calm
upon the sea, as Tubat’s boat shoved her long nose
into the shadows of Lipi. Tubat was a Saribas-
River Dyak, and a Saribas a hundred miles from
home could have but one errand. What that was
the hideous smell told, and the cloud of flies that
followed the nets cast gleefully ashore. Like
cabbage-nets were these, and crammed to bursting
—with grinning human heads! Deep amongst
the mangroves went the boat, out hopped the
crew, and then their leader, standing central,
spoke.
“You have done well, men of the Saribas!
Seven-and-twenty heads have we taken, and there
is grief to-night in many villages. But there is
also anger ; these island wasps are out all round
us, and it is far to the Saribas. We shall do well,
after all, if with these heads we carry back our
own !■ Eit ye now, therefore, and rest; with the
raoonrise we will start.”
Thus, Napoleonically, Tubat; and then to him.
lugubriously, Masan, the croaker :
“ It is in my mind, Tubat, that this thing will
end ill. Ten days’ sail are we from the Saribas,
and it pleases not Batara to see his children so far
from home. More —upon the day we started I
heard the Kariak-bird behind us ; the worst of
omens, O Tubat! ”
But Tubat, the sceptic, laughed as he rolled a
nipa-leaf cigar,
‘‘Thou art a coward, Masan ! and for the faint-
hearted the Kariak never cries in front. As for
Batara, tire white men say he is no god at all—
and the white men are very wise.”
Masan clapped his hand over Tubat’s mouth.
“Be silent, fool! ” he said in a horrified half-
whisper. “ Batara may be close at hand and hear
thee! But see, now, this white stone. To the
Antu* of these waters will I cast it lest he hinder
our voyage home.”
Then a strange thing happened. A score of
yards away, unseen upon the darkening water,
two listening heads had taken in every word, and
Masan’s random stone, cast high in the air, fell
plump on one of these. Without a sound the
swimmer stretched out stunned upon the surface,
whereupon—lest in coming-to be should splash
about—he was promptly forced under water by
his companion, who coolly held him there till he
was drowned, and then started back for the main-
land. In a dozen minutes he had swum the half-
mile, and stood dripping before Kalampu, the
Orang Kaya of Beni-Laut.
“I have seen them, Kalampu. Nine men are
there, and a boy. Many heads have they taken,
and about the rising of the moon to-night will
they take boat again.”
“They may see her rise,” said the grim old
man—“they shall never see her set ! Thou hast
done well, Puki; but Basak—where is he?”
Puki, not without quaking, explained ; “ In
that also didst thou well,” said the Orang ; “ else
had these dogs taken alarm. Basak’s life shall
they pay for with the rest. To the boats ! Half-
way in them, and the rest by swimming.”
• » •
Beneath the broad leaved nipas, lulled by
the drowsy booming of the surf, the head-hunters
fell, one by one, asleep; save only Masan, watch-
ing for the moon. At last a faint light, greenish
against the black forest line, stole up the eastern
sky. Masan sprang to his feet, but only to go
down again on the instant with a cloven skull.
The Beni-Laut men were upon them—ten to one
—and in half-a-minute all was over. Of the
Saribas none lived, save the boy and Tubat—
stunned by a chance flat-stroke of the 21b. parang.
“Hold fast the whelp!” Kalampu said, when
eight sullen sword-blows had told of eight severed
heads. “ And stake the other out! —there will be
a cooking on Lipi Island to-night!”
Then he laughed, and Tubat shuddered till his
brass armlets clinked together. He had done a
little “cooking,” himself, in his time. Could he
but make an end quickly—but no!—in a minute
he was down upon his back, lashed wrist and
ankle to four irunwood pegs. Of ironwood chips,
too, wai the fire that was already lighted—what
for. he knew too well.
The stolen heads were emptied from the nets
and ranged before Kalampu, in the glare. Stoop-
ing down, he scrutinised them one by one. Hero
and there he saw a face he knew, and at each re-
cognition he looked impatiently towards the fire,
now blazing high in air. At last he smiled, took
up on a Chinese spade a little heap of red embers,
walked quietly over to Tubat, and carefully laid
the glowing agony upon the prostrate wretch’s
stomach. The rattan lashings chirped beneath
the sudden strain of the victim's muscles, but they
held ; and, save a single strangled gasp, there was
no other sound.
“Give him time, my children !” said Kalampu
pleasantly to his disappointed myrmidons. “The
Siribas are brave, and the ironwood burns slowly.
Yet again will I warm his belly. Ha ! said I
not so?’’ he added, as, in answer to another shovel-
ful of embers, there burst out suddenly that rare
and horrible sound, a strong man’s shriek, waking
wild echoes amongst the islands, and setting the
Siamang apes howling on the distant mainland.
Then, hour by hour, that awful grill went on, and
not till grey of dawn did the half-roasted carcase
cease to writhe. Then Kalampu struck off the
head, and asked, concerning the trembling boy :
“This sprout of evil—think ye he could find his
way home from Kojak?”
“That could he, Orang,’’ said Puki. “Trust a
Saribas for that! But why let the egg hatch a
serpent ? A head is a head ! ”
“Leave his head where it is ; I have need of
him. See now, thou cub ! —I will send thee up the
coast to Kojak. Thence hasten home, and tell thy
people of the fine cooking thou hast seen this night
on Lipi. For this alone is thy head left on thy
shoulders ! ”
Through ninety miles of jungle the boy got home
at last—a walking skeleton—and never after came
the Saribas men to Beni-Laut.
CAPRICORNUS.

loci, half-divine and doubtfully disposed towards man-
kind.
"Ther Real Tomater”: A Sydney
Back-street Picture.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A room opening on to a narrow street. A girl
seated sewing a pair of trousers : a childish face,
small features and large baby eyes. She sews
rapidly and skilfully, and from time to time the
whirr of the machine takes the place of her needle.
As she stoops to her work a shadow darkens the
doorway. She looks up.
A young man is there. “ Young,” but there is
that about the lines of his face and the corners of
his mouth that more betokens 70 than 17. He is,
perhaps, a composite portrait of the two ages.
A flush came on the girl’s fair face.
“ Yer er pretty sort er bloke! ”
“ W’at cher throwin’ off at us?” replied Billy
as he sidled edgeways into the room.
“ W’y yer never come to the ohassey last night.”
“Well! wot ef 1 didn’t? Lawn blewme, ain’t
er cove ter ’ave ’is little flutter with ther Chinkies
without all this chin music, my oath ! ”
Lizzie, “Ther Real Tomater,” regarded him
with scornful eyes. “ Yer don’t bluff me with
none of yer Chinkies. I know yer dart; yer arter
Ginger Pop, down Riley-street.”
“ Betcher half-a-caser I warn’t, ser help me
never ! Now, me little toucher, don’tcher cut up
rough. I’m out er nick, ain’t got a bean. Straight,
I ain’t.”
“ Well, go ter Ginger Pop and get one. Der yer
think I’m goin’ ter give all my gilt ter er bloke
wot travels with er? Lawd strike me sideways
fust !”
“ I’ll teach yer ter give me lip.”
A hand was raised, and “ Ther Real Tomater ”
received a blow on her fringed forehead that
knocked her down. There was a yell, a scuffle,
and then Lizzie, on her feet again, was fighting
like a red ant.
“ My word ! she’d lick Griffo,” cried Billy, as he
ducked, retreated, and sprang hastily from the
room; “ she’s er fair terror when her monkey’s up,
an’ no mistake.”
Two or three loungers, attracted by the noise of
“the scrap,” came to the doorway, Redfern
Jimmy in front.
“Can’t she use her maulers, an’ no kid ! That’s
what I calls er proper sort o’ a piece, an’ don’t
cher make no bloomin’ error. Billy’s er mug nob
to be proud on ’er.”
“ Who says Billy’s er mug?” and Lizzie came
to the door with fury in her face. “ I’ll take ther
stuffin’ outer ’im.”
The consolers retreated, and Lizzie returned to
her trouser-making, fuming and talking to herself.
Later on a girl with a poke bonnet and dark-
blue uniform entered the room—Captain Mary
Davis, of “ the Harmy.” She commenced to talk
to Lizzie, who listened stolidly. It was the old
story, told with all the fervor of enthusiastic faith.
As the tale went on the listener’s face relaxed its
hard lines ; perhaps the promise of Salvation to
those who truly repent had come upon her as the
glad tidings of a new life. She questioned Cap-
tain Mary, and the officer, on her aide, redoubled
her efforts; for never, so far, after all her struggles
had she con-verted a larrikiness.”
“ ’Ave yer spoke ter Billy ?”
“ Yes, my dear, many times, bub he is har-
dened in sin. The Devil’s gob him sure, for he
scoffs at Salvation,”
“ An’ where der yer think he’ll go ter when he
pegs out ?”
"To Hell fire, where the Devil waits for him.”
“ An’ where der yer think I’ll hang out ?’’
“Oh, my dear sister, if you will only believe,
only repent, then Everlasting Joy is awaiting
you. The golden gates of Heaven will be opened
and you will be happy ever more.”
'appy while Billy’s a-roastin’. Git
out, w’at clier given us! I don’t want none of
yer golden gates an’ that truck. Were Billy
goes I goes. W’ar.s ther good in er gell ef she
don’t stick to ’er bloke ! Wats good enough fer
’im is good enough fer me. I’m just Jack o’yer
chin-music. Straight wire, you cop.”
HENRY FLETCHER.
“ The pay of the Victorian is more than three times
that of the Bullish gunner, while the freedom and advan-
tages he enjoys are incomparably greater. Comparing
his pay with that of an ordinary working man in Victoria
we also find it greatly disproportionate. He is provided
with hoard, lodging and uniform, and gets £1 6s. 3d. per
week, with the prospect of a rapid rise.”— {Melbourne
paper).
An “ old man in a hurry." David Murton,
of Warrnambool (Vic.), who cut his throat the
other day at the age of 81.
A Cairns (N.Q.) newspaper congratulates
its readers that two Afghans have settled in the
vicinity to grow sugarcane. The editor drove out
to inspect their plantation, and “departed, feel-
ing satisfied that in these men the district had
men of the right stamp,” Cairns is a parasitical
township, whose residents have been living, for
the last few years, chiefly on the labor of a few
score Chinese banana-growers ; but latterly the
Chinese have left in cjuantity, and ruin and
desolation stared the white population in the face.
No w the Afghans are coming, they begin to pluck
up heart again. Yellow-skin, brown-skin, black-
skin —Cairns pigs-in comfortably with the lot!

“ The arts o’ peace,” said blacksmith Brown,
addressin’ of the bard,
“ The arts of peace is well enough, though mostly
rather ’ard,
I’m ’appy when I’ve gob a job to keep my fingers
warm ;
But soldier chaps is better off wot wears a
uniform.
“ When ’Opetoun took his noble 'ook, the other
afternoon,
The military gassed enough to float a big balloon,
And little Torn —I ’eld ’im up to let him see the
fun —
Sez, ‘Father, wouldn’t you look prime a-ridin’ on
a gun ! ’
“ I’ve talked about the lazy lives them dandy
mashers led,
In former times when I could earn my blessed
daily bread,
But, now that things is lookin’ bad and ’unger’s on
my track,
I’d like to loaf in barracks with a poker up my
back.
“ Why wasn’t I a gunner in the service of the
Queen
A-pitohin’ stirrin’ stories of the fights I never
seen ;
There’s no one wants my brawny arras. Believe
me when I say
I wish I kept a cannon clean at three-and-nine a
day. •
“ I haven’t ’ad a bib of work these dozen weeks or
more—
It ain’t for such as me they needs to guard our
native shore.
Of course I scorn the forrin’ yoke, like Nelson in
the song,
Yet I couldn’t get no poorer if the Rooshans came
along.
“ And since that word ‘ invashun ’ is a gallant
majah’s ‘gag,’
And our army’s only foolin’ for the * Aonor of the
flag,’
There’s lots of us would like the chance to fill an
achin’ void
By changin’ places sometimes with the warlike
hunemployed.
“ My line is useful labor, which I haven’t tried to
shirk,
Bub as the Turner Government can’t find me any
work.
And everybody tells me ’ow there’s nothing to be
done,
I’d gladly draw some wages for a-playin’ with a
gun.
“ The arts of peace is very well for them that’s on
the job ;
It’s when you go from day to day and never earn
a ‘bob ’
You hear the wild waves sayin’ as they guards
your native shore
* The safest line to foller is the peaceful art of
war.’”

A WONDERFUL MEDICINE.
Beecham’s Pills
0)
: V
ft
PATENT
PILLS.
Are universally admitted
to be worth a Guinea
a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in
the stomach, sick head-
ache, giddiness, fulness
and swelling after meals,
dizziness, and drowsiness,
cold chills, flushings of
heat, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, cos-
tiveness, scurvy, blotches
on the skin, disturbed
sleep, frightful dreams,
and all nervous and trem-
bling sensations, &o. The
first dose will give relief
in twenty minutes. Every
offerer is earues-ay invited to try one box of these

For females of all ages these Fills are invaluable-
as a few doses of them carry off all humors, and :
bring about all that is required. No female should
be without them. There is no medicine to be found-
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will
soon restore females of all ages to sound and robust
health. This has been proved by thousands who have
tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all disorders-
of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
organs in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical-
energy of the human frame. These are “FACTS” testified
continually 'by members of all classes of society ; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated
is, Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.

THE GREAT TEST MATCH ,
BETWEEN the SONS op the LITHE WILLOW of MOTHER ENGLAND and the COLONIES.
Which has caused all but universal interest, suggests the thought whether anyone has ever remarked
on a far greater Test than this.
This is the great Test which has been applied to the PRINCE OF WALES HOTEL for the
last quarter of a century, and which it has gloriously withstood, satisfied and won; and to-day it
stands out more boldly, more defiantly, more honored by the thousands of patrons who daily visit
the Quaint Old House.

COME and INSPECT, SAMPLE and TEST the QUALITY and PRICES of his GENERAL
STOCK.
