Literary Hysterics
Any respectable medium who lias Mars _
the god t not the planet —on his wave-lengtn
can do one suffering mortal a good turn by
asking the old sharper if he has yet pliiyeu
the joker. I am haunted by a suspicion that
he has not. One after the other I have
watched the crafty old dog slipping the cards
out of his sleeve, and I have lost count.
When, soon after the war, the earth was
inundated w T ith a flood of revolting and
brutally realistic word pictures of mangled
bodies, congealing blood, decomposing ncsn
and all the obvious and inevitable rest ot it,
set down by sundry shrewd gentlemen stiirei-
by the altruistic motive of making a little
money, I believed Mars had played his last
dirty trick. It wasn’t an ace, perhaps, but
certainly not the joker. For in the last few
months yet another leading card has been
slowly emerging from the sleeve of mail and
has just struck the earth with a thump. It
is an avalanche of fiction with literary pre-
tensions written retrospectively in the hrst
person singular, its theme being the effect
which war had upon normal citizens living
sufficiently close to the actual conflict to be
in daily contact with the unreal excitement.
A typical example is The Happy Tree, by
Rosalind Murray (Cliatto and Windus). I
bring it into the argument merely because
it is the only one of the six read in the last
month which I still have; I owed gifts to
many people of poor judgment.
It is human to lean up against things, and
the war is still the thing against winch the
greatest number lean. Whole nations use it
for their shameless post as an alternative
to taking off their coats and doing a bit of
work, and surely it is no less logical for the
middle-aged women of these novels to blame
it for their stepping down from the pedestal
of chastity. The retrospective lady ot Ihe
Happy Tree” differs in this respect from
most of the others ; she rather blames it for
keeping her on the pedestal. But these,
after all, are not intolerable features, and
scarcely constitute a fashion. This last
exists in the literary pretensions of what
amounts to a definite new school of: fiction
writers, known —or it ought to be—-as the
School of Literary Hysterics. The objective
of every member of the school is to strike
an Edith Sitwell attitude on a pedestal of
futurist design and scream, furioso fortis-
simo, “How clever I amj Look how I jerk
words about! Why, I’m a really truly
devil!” And they “get away with it. I hey
can, as Rosalind Murray does, go on tor
page after page in this manner :
Hugo said:
“I came back on Tuesday.”
I said:
“Oh. I did not know you were back.”
I said:
“Was it interesting in India?”
Hugo said:
“Yes, it was v«ry interesting. The colors are
wonderful there. You can’t imagine what the colors
are like.”
I said:
“Like Holman Hunt, are they?”
He said:
“Almost; the purples, not the greens so much.
I said:
“That must be jolly.”
Hugo said:
“Yes.”
The defence for that sort of thing always is
that it is realistic: that it is actual dialogue
as it occurs in.life. But such detail is farci-
cal in retrospective fiction; I question
whether it isn’t farcical in all fiction. Admit-
tedly most people do converse quite as dully
as that, but the art of writing effectively con-
sists in tiie stripping away of non-essentials,
and in no phase of writing so much as in
dialogue. And, supposing there are literary
cormorants capable of swallowing that sort
of rubbish as dialogue, wliat is the defence
for this ?
And I thought:
“Is this ‘A lightening before death’ ?”
And I thought:
“Death does not matter —death and life are one!’
And I thought:
“This is truth, this glory of flaming trees.”
And I felt a burst of joy.
I felt:
“This still goes on.”
I felt:
“What do I matter, or all that matters, to me ? ’
And I felt that it was for Hugo, this chorus of
trees.
I felt: . ,
“This is his wood. The trees»are sinking for him.
And I felt:
“I have understood.... I have understood at last.
What, I ask you, is the defence for that?
Wisdom? Two puny platitudes! Imagery?
A fourpenny hunger that verbiage smothers
to a squib!
Yet there are thousands of apparently sane
people who cannot pick up a volume of this
sort of gushing nonsense without going into
rhapsodies about its literary qualities.
I suppose:
“They are sincere.”
I suppose:
“I haven’t t-he artistic appreciation.”
And I suppose:
“They have.”
But I think:
“The Big Masters of the School of Literary Hys-
terics are throwing things.”
And I think:
“A lot of earnest students are stopping those
things.”
And I think:
“Those things are gold-bricks.”
CECIL MANN.
The Supersession of the Schoolmaster
In “The World of William Clissold,” Mr.
H. G. Wells, the unfrocked pedagogue, once
more attacks the middle-class and upper-class
secondary schools of England, because the
men who staff t/aem are “the last human
beings in the world in whom you are likely
to find a spark off creative energy or a touch
of imaginative V igor.” This is a Wellsian
statement, put into the mouth of William
Clissold, which arouses resentment in those
who regard the public-school system of Eng-
land with complacency. >Yet it is worth
while to take stock in our educational institu-
tions, even in A ustralia.
I am not svire, however, that the Great
Public Schools! of Australia! are entitled to
reel the self-satisfaction some of their head-
masters exprf !ss. The onicouragement of
school tradition and school pride often
becomes a snojolbery which a sec-
lial feeling In the life of the nation,
ther the universities nor later life can
rect this early bias. I have noticed its
wth of late years especially. There is
intolerance of the principle expressed in
old legal maxim “audi alteram partem”
ich encourages the existence of class-con-
msness and division in the community—
iangefous thing for so young a nation
Australia. We often teach the humani-
; without a touch of humanity. Grammar
1 games are not enough, just as patriot-
i is not enough in the comity of nations,
e old classical tradition, the traditions of
mid-Victorian English Public Schools,
not enough. Our boys must be brought
o closer touch with actualities.
Australian youth has a fine discrimination
ween what is useful in modern education
I what is valueless. They have the touch,
1 their practical minds seize upon the
;ful with enthusiasm. The majority refuse
agree with the old scholastic cant about
3 utility, even as a discipline, of grinding
3 rules of Latin grammar and writing
or prose in a language supposed to be
eeronian. The best mental discipline
rings from the interest which makes studies
:al and absorbing to the mind. Science
a discipline, deep, moral and grave; whilst,
Bacon says, History makes men wise,
d mathematics make them subtle. A know-
Ige of Latin and Greek plays no serious
,rt in our modern life at the Antipodes,
le most vigorous and successful of our
iders in commerce, finance and politics are,
a rule, men who did not enjoy the benefits
limed for a classical education. Our fore-
ost writers and poets, with one or two
ceptions, are men whose education has
en the result of their own selective efforts,
s a cultural study Latin and Greek are
agnificent, if the student really enters the
easure-house with the key which his early
iucatiou has given him. Only a very few
er succeed in doing this. The majority
aste their time trying" to turn the key in
e lock, and stand bewildered on the outer
reslield, unmindful of the existence of the
isy side-door of translations. When we look
: our national environment we are driven
think that the study of Japanese would
3 as great a discipline, and of much greater
se. Unfortunately we have few professors
id teachers who are capable of giving the
istruction. The vested interest lies in Latin
id Greek, which must therefore be the
)rpus vile of their operations until such
me as outside opinion forces a change.
: Japanese cannot be universally taught,-
•eater concentration on English, French
id German would provide equal mental
scipline, equal culture in literature, and
jof infinitely greater utility. Let us leave
le classics to the few whose careers make
leir study necessary, or possible as a cul-
iral luxury. I do not belittle their value,
le elegance of their literary forms, nor the
iterest of the ancient civilisations whose
lirit they express. They arc for the pure
diolar, or the aristocrat of leisure who poss-
esses the taste for the beauty and euriosi-
es of antiquity and archaeology.
I cannot pass judgment upon sehool-
msters without including myself. I am bound
i admit the element df truth in Wells’s
atirie picture of. Mr. Walpole Stent, of
fimbourne. We are essentially, even m
uistralia, “a class of refugees from the
ovelties and strains of life. Conformist,
enteel people, of an infinite discretion and
n invaluable formality.” We live in the
hains of good form, and often die without
merging from mental adolescence. We are
he humble slaves of bells, time-tables and
xamination rules. We are often monastic
n habits and temperament, without the com-
tensations of the monastic system, and we
ire prone to pass our lives in stagnant back-
vaters of the river of life. Being poor in a
'ommunity whose main end is the acquisition
if riches,' our pupils and ex-pupils are con-
emptuous, or condescendingly charitable. Gov-
■rnors, trustees, politicians and other talkers
shatter glibly of the services we render to
he communitv in the formation of the nat-
onal character. They pay this lip service,
juite sincerely, once a year. In the mean-
;ime. most of us are lucky if we can retire
it the age of 65 with a pension of £3 a
veek and a memory stored with the trivial-
ities of our past existence. Can the com-
munity and the schools really expect super-
men at such remuneration and under such
conditions?
The staff common rooms of our schools
are full of discontent and futilities. The
talk of a group of masters from the Great
Public Schools always proves a disappoint-
ment to the uninitiated who are looking for
uplift or aesthetic culture. Our witticisms
and humor are the threadbare jokes of the
class-room, where laughter is almost com-
pulsory. Genteel poverty has made us afraid
of our jobs, and we are so deep in the ruts
of life that few of us can earn a living out-
side the school. There is another side. , I
have never met a class of men more genuinely
devoted to their work, isolated by it, and
capable of self-sacrifice to the interests of an
institution than schoolmasters. We are
loyalty itself. We are industrious journey-
men carrying on a tradition of service in
a spirit which should shame those whom
we serve. Whether our efforts are well
directed is another matter. We should cer-
tainly be more useful and vital, as teachers
and leaders, if we went out into the world
every alternate year in order to perform
some of the things we endeavor to teach,
arid to feel the cold winds of reality and
criticism blowing upon our enthusiasms for
lost causes and worn-out loyalties. We
should not be such retarding shadows upon
youth, nor arrest the development of a man-
hood we do not understand. It is a good
thing that we have been partially super-
seded by the cinema, the newspaper, the

Why British?
WENTIMENT has its place in business, but
it is not a very large one. When we urge
you to buy Armstrong Whitworth Products
we rely on sounder arguments.
It is true, for instance, that Armstrong Whitworth
have perhaps greater resources for handling
engineering contracts of all kinds than any other
firm in the world. But there is an even more
important fact than this.
The name of Armstrong Whitworth is bound
up with the reputation of the word British.
It is a reputation first and foremost of quality, of
sound and lasting value and of honourable dealing.
Foreign nations throughout the world buy
Armstrong Whitworth products, from loco-
motives to small tools —buy them for their value
and for the certainty that lower prices could only
be secured at the expense of quality.
And to give sentiment its place, let us remember
that for us who are all members of the British
Empire, dependent on each other in times of
trouble, it is a good and wise thing that we should
help and support each other in times of peace.

FRANCIS JACKSON.
Shaw as Dramatic Critic
I suppose that I have read as much of
Bernard Shaw as most people, aud with
others admired the maimer in which his
richly-caparisoned paradoxes have swung
across the foreground of our literature, yet
I have never been able to understand Ins
almost unchallenged position as a dramatic
critic. His views on the theatre, collected
into two plump volumes by the industrious
James Huneker, are 30 years old, and though
weak enough about the water-line to invite
a torpedo are held as unassailable as the
English Constitution.
Why this is so I do not know, but 1
risk the guess that they beguile critics into
silence by their subtle overdress of metro-
politan worldliness, concealing opinions
seductive to the crowd at large. You can-
not read a Shaw theatrical essay without
spotting its innate respectability. Beside
Lemaitre’s dapper impressionism Shaw s
work is staid in content, though not in
style; whilst compared with the ribald writ-
ing of Nathan in America it is an old-
maid’s treatise on sponge-cakes. I even dare
to think that poor old Francisque Sarcey,
who once proclaimed his readiness to “weep
hot tears” over Hauptmann’s “Hannele,”
was less afflicted with the Puritan complex
than Shaw. Each Shavian critique is a
stadium in which his aesthetic sensitiveness
is scissor-loeked by his moral indignation.
Bernard may prance and caper, venture
quip and sally, but his Puck wears the blue
nose of a typical presbyter. In other words,
Madame Grundy is his Circe, his other
wife.
Turn to his lectures on Sardou, produc-
tive of that fair and fetching term “Sar-
doodledum,” which was the myrrh and
frankincense of epithet to numerous Shavian
isolators in my youth, and you will observe
a metaphoric holiday declared and the
thanks of the nation tendered to Shaw by
himself over the tremendous discovery of
Sardou’s mechanical commonplaces. If
Shaw had left it at that, he might have been
granted a medal for exploratory criticism;
but, driven by his gloomy vegetarian con-
science, which was for ever starching his
artistic fancy, he wrote down “Fedora” as
"brutally, callously, barbarously immoral,”
though, if the truth be told, that now some-
what unexciting melodrama would blush to
the roots of its third act if it found itself
in the same playhouse with “White Cargo”
or “Rain.”
Further, to the revelation of his narrow-
ness, scan his observations on Pinero with
a modest and unprejudiced eye. Here let
us state fairly are exceedingly clever writing
and all the shrewd appeal of a deftly-drama-
tis' d Nietzsche, who had learnt to make the
language do the splits in the dialectic gym-
nastics of socialistic cart-tails. Moreover,
there is some appreciation of Pinero as a
dovetailer of theatrically attractive scenes,
but the opinion always cowers under a
load of moral reservation, and, in cases, of
downright ignorance. For example, he idioti-
cally denounces Paula Tanqueray as “the
same at three as at thirty-three” (I quote
his actual words), therein tom-tomming the
superstition that the Paulas are doomed to
duplicity and multiple lives from birth. On
the Ebbsmith woman the whole Shavian
jazz-orchestra becomes audible, the saxo-
phones taking up the main theme of Mrs.
Ebbsmith’s theatrical unreality, whilst the
banjos tinkle the sweet refrain that no
sentimental agnostic would be guilty of
Christian superstition in a crisis. Here I
allude obviously to the Bible-snatching epi-
sode which to Shaw was farcically impos-
sible, but which would appear probable and
even inevitable to those familiar with the
sexual constitution of the Ebbsmith type.
Havelock Ellis would have understood Mrs.
Ebbsmith, and to Freud and Krafft-Ebbing
she would have been an exhibit A.
Shaw’s radical defect as a critic was the
lack of a cultivated attitude to the other
sex. Just as Nietzsche’s anti-feminism is
an intellectualised heartache, later blithely
exposed in his sister’s story of his reaction
to Frau Salome, so was Shaw’s plumed
and bouncing cynicism on the ladies the
affectation of a pop-eyed milkhand after
his first encounter with Elinor Glyn. When
you understand this, many marvels become
plain, particularly his proclamation of some-
thing epochal and stirring in such of Ibsen’s
corseted platitudes as Nora ITelmer and
Rebecca West. The Eternal Triangle Shaw
sees from an obtuse angle.
I have not the space to discuss his atti-
tude to the Bard, an attitude born of outrage
to his Puritan centres, but one is with him
when he wings the pundits with the shrapnel
of “Better Than Shakspeare,” and against
him when he caresses them with the con-
tention that Shakspeare is better without
scenery. If there was a deplorable oblitera-
tion of the literary interest in the show-
window furniture-displays that Beerbolim
Tree presented in the name of Shakspeare,
the dull symbolism of a drab backcloth
bearing three-ply legends reading “A Tavern”
or “A Street in Venice” is distraction of
quadruple imbecility.
Yet this much must be said about Shaw
finally. He may rabidly denounce the “well-
made” play when it is written by Pinero or
Sardou, and two pages later consider it a
fine-art work when it has just dropped
from the nib of Ibsen ; he may uphold the
moral sensitiveness and splendor of that
master platitudinist Henry Arthur Jones,
and greatly admire “Magda” aforesaid,
though it is mostly an echo of Augier’s
faded “Manage d’Olympe,” the almost for-
gotten parallel of “Camille,” and still remain
infinitely readable, infinitely persuasive. His
prose is as fresh in form to-day as it was
in the “ ’nineties.” It may be the vehicle
of certain dubious judgments, but it carries
many a fruity sentence, many a phrase in
night-haunt finery that goes skipping, gay
and chuckling in the byways of the mind.
RICHARD BEAMISH.
The Little Masterpiece
The short story is the most interesting
and the most difficult form of literary ex-
pression. Historically, it is one ot the
earliest of literary exercises. Man has
net been able to trace it to its genesis, stu-
dents agree, however, that to the pygmy bush-
men of South Africa and to our own last
disappearing abos. goes the credit of being
the first primitive users of the short story as
a means of expressing folk lore, race super-
stition and race history. It is unfortunate
that but few of the folk-tales of the abos.
have been placed on record; these stories,
or most of them, have died with the race,
one of the oldest of aboriginal people, one
of the hardest used and the least understood.
The most ancient short story recorded is
the tale of King Ivhafri. It was first told
by one of the sons of Cheops, the greatest oi
the pyramid builders, nearly 7000 years ago
It was the custom of Cheops to bid his sons
tell him tales of the old magicians. These
recitals were recorded by a scribe in about
3459 b.c., who credits Kliafri, the successor
to Cheops and the second of the great
pyramid builders, with telling the first story.
It is of the breaking of mother right, a warn-
ing to women not to attempt to revive the
custom by which woman was the proposer
to man —and the disposer.
The greatest of the early short-story tellers
were the priests of Buddha. When Gaut-
ama, son of a South Nepal chieftain, arose
in the sixth century B.C. with his creed of
uniting all castes in one common system of
spiritual salvation, he, known soon after as
Buddha, the Enlightened One, preached his
new gospel by means of short tales of fable
and magic, each with a moral pointing to the
new religious faith. His stories became the
fables of the people of the time. Most of
them centred in the Buddhist belief in rein-
carnation, and were known as the Jatakas,
or Birth stories. They numbered over 500,
and after the Buddha’s death were collected
by his priests and placed on record. In this
form their fame spread through India to
Persia, thence to Syria and Greece. Here
most of them were transcribed by a priest
named Planudes, and many of them have
been handed down through the ages as the
fables of JEsop, the most delightful of all
magical stories. Jssop, it is now accepted,
was the mythical creation of Planudes.
The Brahmins also made good use of the
short fable-story to propagate their orthodox
caste-religion. Their stories are based on
the Buddhist tales, and were written m a
book known as the Pancha Tantra, dated
200 b.c., and another book, which had a
direct appeal to kings and princes, known as
the Hitopadesa, the book of Princely Instruc-
tion.
The earliest examples of the short story
in Europe came from Greece. Herodotus,
who was born about 490 b.c., is credited
with being the author of the earliest Greek
stories that have been recorded, although
there was an earlier collection known as
the Milesian Tales, a number of loose anec-
dotes. which included work by Aristides.
Herodotus, a daring traveller, recorded his
stories in his great history, which he wrote
when he settled in Italy. His masterpiece
is the Treasure of King Rhampsinitus, a
tradition of Raineses the Great. It is one
of the earliest examples of the narrative
story as we now know it. The Greeks,
following Herodotus, practised the art, and
some beautiful examples have been handed
down by them, notably the story of Cupid
and Psyche, written about a.d. 140 —“one of
the loveliest and most spiritual things in
the history of fiction.”
In the early-Middle Ages the Asiatic fable
stories spread through Greece and Italy to
France and Britain, and were told to the
people by bards and wandering minstrels.
There quickly followed a native literature.
One of the finest of the early stories of the
bards is the Irish tale, the Fate of Deirdre,
“one of the high things of man’s making.”
Deirdre herself ranks beside Helen of Troy
and Gudrun of Iceland. The Gaels of Erin
collected and told many great myths of
ancient Erin, and the Cyrnri recorded many
gems of Welsh romance. The most famous
of these are the Arthurian legends, immortal-
ised later by Sir Thomas Malory.
The Arthurian romances passed from
Britain to France, where they were spread
through France and Italy by the Norman
minstrels. The French and the Germans
improved on them, re-composed them and
were the first to record them, and their
minstrels told and sung them to the gentry
and the peasantry for centuries. Amongst
the greatest of these itinerant story-tellers
was Old Antif, who is credited with the
authorship of Aucassian and Nicolette, a
love story which ranks with that of Romeo
and Juliet. In the time of Old Antif, the
monks and the friars were setting up a
literature of their own, borrowing freeiy
from the folk-lore of all peoples and all
times, and including these stories in a volume
called the Gesta Romanorum. Amongst
these stories was a tale, the Three Caskets,
handed down from the ancient Persians,
which Shakspeare used in “The Merchant of
Venice.” At this time also the Vikings,
turned from war to pastoral pursuits, were
gathering their romantic stories and mould-
ing them into some of the finest folk-tales
in literature. There were being gathered,
too, those tales of Bagdad that have come
down to us as the Arabian Nights Enter-
tainments : stories first told by men whose
names were never preserved. These stories
were collected from many sources —from
Persia, India, Arabia, Syria, Turkey. They
were known along the ancient caravan routes
centuries before they were translated from
the Persian into the Arabic in the tenth
century. Our first version came to us over
400 years ago.
The modern short story dates from the
fourteenth century, when Giovanni Bocae-
cio, drawing freely on the Gesta Romanorum
and weaving his own fabrics gave to the
world “The Decameron.” With him closed
the first era of the short story, the era
which saw the birth, growth and first
development and exploitation of the folk-
story and the fable invented by many people
in many ages, and the opening of the modern
era, which is the era of. the individual
writer, the expression of individual opinions,
and not of a people as a mass. With the
close of this era, too, passed the short story
from the Eastern to Pm Western _ world,
where since it has always remained- a
little jewel discovered and fashioned into
a brilliant gem by the greatest lapidaries of
the world of letters.
C. E. S.
A Satchel of Books
My Early Life , by William 11., ex-Emperor of
Germany (Methuen). A record of the first 30
years of the ex-Kaiser’s life. And that so much time
should have been spent in preparing. for such a
lamentable conclusion as that at Doom might furnish
material for a dozen edifying discourses.
The Poetical Works of John Gay, by G. C. Faber
(Oxford University Press, London). This conscien-
tious editor preserves all that is of value of Gay’s
work and mountains of dull stuff that nobody need
bother with. Why cumber bookshelves when “The
Beggar’s Opera,” “Polly” and “Trivia” sufficiently
express and preserve his delightful qualities. He was
buried with pomp in Westminster Abbey and “honestly
mourned by dukes and duchesses.” What more
could any poet want?
Rosa, by Knut Hamsun (Knopf). This translation
from the Norwegian text of the author shows him
in a less sombre mood than in “Growth of the
Soil.” Whilst complete in itself, it picks up and
carries on the thread of “Benoni,” in which Rosa is
the central figure of emotional interest. Among
the incidental characters is an Englishman as seen
bv Norwegian eyes —“a lonely and peculiar 50u1....
he drank terribly when he was bored....at home in
England he had' many castles.” Not flattering, and
nowadays the “many castles” would need some
seeking.
Feathered Minstrels of Australia, by A. H. Chis-
holm and N. W. Gayley (Simmons). This is the
first booklet of a series of seven whose object is to
render some measure of j'ustice to the vocal abilities
of Australian birds. The present section includes
the Ivre-bird, the magpie, the grey thrush, the
golden whistler, the silver-eye, the white-throated
warbler and the bush-lark. Mr. Chisholm provides
the interesting letterpress and Mr. Cayley furnishes
admirably produced illustrations, one in color, ot
the birds described.
The Mad Painter and Other Bush Sketches , by J.
M. Stevens (Vidler). The dominant note in this
little book of sketches, the principal of which is the
story of the artist Galt, whom misadventure lias
driven into the bush, is its love of nature. The
author has imbued herself with the spirit of the
rich subtropical lands on the northern coast of N. S.
Wales. Her book is full of lush beauty and color,
and its value is increased by Christian Yandell s
characteristic illustrations.
Days of Disillusion, by Chester F. Cobb (Allen
and Unwin). A book of exceptional qualities by an
Australian writer whose first novel, “Mr. Moffatt,’
won high praise in England. Although the scene
of the story is Sydney, the book has little local color.
It depends' on the struggles of a youth as he develops
into mature years, caught in the current of life, and
exhibits with the almost repellent insensitiveness of
a surgeon’s knife the gradual stripping away of his
life’s illusions. “Why is it,” exclaims Bob Watson, the
central figure of this drama of modern conditions,
“that to get to know anybody really well is to be
disillusioned?” The book is highly introspective
and almost surcharged with the violence of the swing
from youthful optimism to the later pessimism ot
disappointed hopes. Peace of mind is found at last
in a readjustment of values and a more rational
appreciation of life’s proportions. The book is full
of little touches that will appeal to “the new genera-
tion” to whom it has been dedicated.
The Tenderfoots, by Francis Lynde (Scribner’s;
Dymock). It is not often that a good book comes
out of the tangle of cowpunchers, guns and weird
vernacular of the wild west, but Mr. Lynde has suc-
ceeded in offering a novel that has literary value. For
its plot it casts back into the ’seventies and turns on
the fight of Philip Trask to make good in a mining
venture. The characters are more than the cardboard
puppets That do duty in the average novel of wild-
west adventure.
Essays of To-day and Yesterday (Harrap). The
first step in forming a reading habit, according to
Mr. Birrell, a selection of whose essays has been
added to this series, “is to breed an easy faminantj
with the outsides of books, and to feel as comfortable
in their company as an ostler amongst horses. M •
Gardiner, best known for his biographical woiks, i-
a contributor, too, and turns out to be quite sparK-
ling.
The Tower Rooms, by Mary Grant Bruce (Ward
Lock). When Doris Earle, worn out with her toil
in a private school for young ladies in a Melbourne
suburb, became a governess on a station whose
homestead was The Towers, she entered on the
adventures which make up the material of a book
that will appeal to all girls of an age when matri-
mony has the charm of romance. The writer has
a bright and intimate style, with faith in the old
concepts.
Radio Drama and How to Write It, by Gordon
Lea (Allen and Unwin). The author submits that
in the medium of broadcasting the dramatist has
in some respects an instrument more suitable tor
his purpose than the stage. In radio drama the
scene is built up in the imagination of the listener,
and is not circumscribed by the scenic limitations
of the stage; it allows for the individual factor, as
each listener will supply his own ideas out of his
own experience. Already the British Broadcasting
Co. has made some serious attempts to find the right
form for radio drama. When that has been accom-
plished, the author believes that a wide field will
be opened for the new’ dramatist, and the featuring
of plays as part of their programme will become as
familiar as the transmission of music.
Good-bye, Stranger, by Stella Benson (Macmillan).
The author has written much better novels than
this one. The background to the story is an Inland
Mission in China and the central figures a group of
American folk who talk incessantly, and so conceal
any fragments of plot the novel possesses.
The Papacy and the Kingdom of Italy, by Hum-
phrey Johnson (Sheed and Ward). An interesting
historical sketch of the events leading up to the
ending of the temporal power of the lapacy, with
some speculation as to the possibility of an agree-
ment between the Vatican and the Quirinal.
Christianity and the Present Moral Unrest (Allen
and Unwin). A volume of essays by the Master of
Balliol the Bishop of Manchester and other prominent
churchmen and professors of moral philosophy, ethics,
psychology and economics. The object of the volume is
to show that the ethical ideas represented by Christi-
anity taken in its wildest sense, are applicable to the
moral problems which face the present day and
contain the clue to their solution.
Wilson’s Street Directory for 1027 is the twenty-
fifth issue of a chubby little tome that tells one
how to find any address in Sydney or the Blue
Mountains. The city sprawls and spreads so vigor-
ously that each year finds the Directory fatter, more
copiously be-mapped, and more necessary as a work
of reference. The best feature of the publication
is that it is always right, and another good point
about it is that it fits snugly in any pocket. With
a Wilson’s and a compass it is impossible to get
lost in Sydney.
-♦
“S.R.M.”: It might be of help to “C” (B. 6/l/’27)
in his search after the history of Thomas Ashe, the
infamous pamphleteer, to know that a passage to
N.S.W. w’as ordered for him by Lord Bathurst. The
boat he was to sail on was the Broxburnbury, which
arrived at Sydney in July, 1813. Before the order
w’as ‘ issued for his passage his past career was
investigated, and he was described as “a writer of
libellous publications of a mischievous nature, and
of a personal character not without blemish.” When
Macquarie replied to the despatches received by the
Broxburnbury, he mentioned all the free settlers
who had arrived by that boat and asked for instruc-
tions in regard to them, but made no mention of
Ashe. Perhaps the pamphleteer was one of those
who, after all, stayed at home for Australia’s good.

Macouarie-street.
Frowning cliffs that front the bay;
At their feet a garden gay.
Street of debonair disdain,
Street of Talk and street of Pain.
Once a way of solitude,
Rapt in reminiscent mood,
Modern stress its silence scorns,
Loud with raucous motor-horns!
Now it manufactures fees.
“Thank you, yes ; two guineas, please!”
Here is diagnosed our fate:
Sentence passed—or life elate!
Where the ancient Houses meet
Empty talk afflicts the street;
At the Legislature’s awe
Falstaff laughs his huge guffaw.
There our history is forged.
From that talking-shop disgorged
Pours with scarce a single pause
Crudities that look like laws.
But these tawdry things forget:
Literature is left us yet;
Priceless manuscripts and lore
Hold the precious past in store.
Where in other cities meet
Such a gracious, stately street?
Old Macquarie should suffice —
Dreen parterre of Paradise!
Though with traffic now it teems,
To old Burdekin it seems
Still the broad and gracious walk,
Cluttered up with foolish talk.

He sits impassive in the cart
Behind the old flea-bitten gray,
A silent Chinaman, apart,
His thoughts a thousand leagues away.
I wonder what those thoughts may be.
Ho visions fill his waking dreams
Of river-craft and crowded streams,
Of Y&ngtse flowing to the sea
Through yellow dust that softly falls
Upon the ancient city walls?
Peacli-gardens pink with bloom he knew;
Green willows drooped beside the pool;
He worked where white azaleas grew,
Wistaria and lilies cool.
He often heard the drum and gong,
Saw lanterns swinging over all,
Observed the Dragon Festival
With throbbing heart and reedy song,
And made his way with shuffling feet
Through jostling crowds that thronged the
street.
His secret thoughts untramelled roam
Across the distances, and reach
Far China, loved and sacred home
Of kindred and familiar speech.
Yet passively beside the door
Each Saturday he smiles and stands
Inscrutable, with wrinkled hands
And laden baskets, bowed and poor,
A stranger on an alien soil,
But rich in dreams beyond his toil.

ETHEL MARTYR.
The Storm-bird.
All day, unseen, you’ve sent that eerie call,
Each note itself a plaint, a doleful plea.
Strange you should pour to moulds of
melody
A molten longing that must sere and gall!
If you were human, little one, your heart
Could not cry forth its sorrows undis-
mayed ;
But they would furtively away be laid,
The while you turned to smile, and act a part,
And force yourself, though wearisome the
role,
, To wear a mask from keen and prying eyes,
And never let the world know otherwise
But that you went your care-free way heart-
whole !
Be comforted, since your insistence bold
Will find its surcease in the coming rain.
For me? What shower can call to life
again
An idyll that has long lain stark and cold?
QUEENSLAND.
E. M. ENGLAND.
Pirate.
In the bitter ways of the sea I met a
stranger.
Hij mouth was sweet, but the black of his
hair was danger.
He tore the heart from my breast and left
me lying
Under the spray-washed sky, with the sea-
birds crying.
Away in the warm South, with the painted
flowers,
He prays at another shrine through moonlit
hours.
But I had the best of love, when life was
taking
Body and soul of him, and his pride was
breaking.
To the girl with the Southern eyes he may
smile his duty ;
But I had his song and his strength, and his
naked beauty.
Under the autumn skies in the Northern
weather.
With the wild wet sea on our lips we clung
together.
< >ver the sea of life the black sails hover,
The shadow of blood, and chains, and the
rack for a lover.

PICTURES OF INDUSTRY.
After Arbitration Judge Dethridge, with
the assistance of J udge Beery, had granted a
44-hours week to the engineering unions all
over Australia the Chief Judge had a second
thought, and spoke a piece from the Bench
about the necessity for strenuous effort to
keep up production. He even said that in
the absence of any such effort piecework
would become inevitable. Ilis Honor’s re-
marks were not well received in boiler-
making, blacksmithing, moulding and other
iron circles, and they aroused an emphatic
reply to the effect that piecework would not
come, either soon or late or any old time.
The suggestion that energy should be dis-
played brought no very definite response,
unless a cryptic official utterance by the
president of a Trades Hall Council might be
regarded as having some bearing on the case.
It was as follow’s :
The trades-union movement is just as anxious as
any other section of the community to maintain
production commensurate with the needs of the
people. The difficulty we are faced with is that
we find ourselves unable to trust those who are
clamoring for more production.
It was unsatisfactory, inasmuch as the
president didn’t state specifically that "those
who are clamoring for more production” had
asked to be trusted with anything of liis ; in
fact, all they had asked was that they might
be able to trust him and his friends not to
go on strike with too complete disregard of
Arbitration principles. And it was especially
unsatisfactory as regards the statement that
the trades-union movement is anxious "to
maintain production commensurate with the
need of the people.” In 1922-23 Australia
expended £35,203,294, which it could ill
afford, in buying abroad, to supply "the
needs of the people,” goods which the various
iron trades should have supplied but didn’t.
In 1925-26 it paid away £45,303,928 to
outside folk for iron goods because the local
unions fell still further short of maintaining
"production commensurate with the needs of
the people.” It is the rule of the "move-
ment” that no one outside the union may
work at the union’s trade, and that every-
body who has succeeded in getting inside
must work under conditions aiming at strict
limitation of output, whether “the needs of
the people” are urgent or not. The mon-
strous foreign loan policy, which now
approaches breaking point, is forced on Aus-
tralia because production is now always
below the needs (in other words the liabili-
ties) of the people, and sometimes as much
as £50,000,000 below them in a single year.
The logical outcome of it all will be inability
to pay. and the establishment of a sort of
financial protectorate over Australia, as once
happened to Egvpt, with kindly advisers
from outside to collect the revenues and
supervise the expenditure of a community
which has tried to manage its own affairs
and failed.
* » * *
There is another and a widely different side
to the industrial situation —in fact, it is so
widely different that the two sides seem
impossible in the same country. About the
time when the Chief Judge and the Trades
Hall Council president were exchanging
backchat a picturesque land-settlement item
appeared in a Sydney daily:—
With the temperature at 110 degrees, the dust
and flies making conditions almost unbearable, a
new settler walked 30 miles yesterday to start his
out-back life. He was parched with thirst when
he reached his block of land. The only water avail-
able was at the bottom of his tank. It was hardly
fit to drink, and a dead horse reposed on the bank.
The settler quenched his thirst. His family will
also have to use the water for drinking and domestic
purposes. It is the only water in the vicinity, and
several families—some of them miles away—come
there for drinking water.
Stock also make assaults on the meagre supply,
and the settlers round about have a hard task to
prevent them cleaning it up.
Shallow bores in the vicinity are mostly too
brackish for stock. The great drawback of the
country round here is the lack of a suitable water
supply. Excavations in the mallee country would
hold the water if there were means of filling them.
The engineer of the Water Commission has sub-
mitted a scheme to the settlers to take water from
the Lachlan. The water would have'to be lifted a
considerable distance. The Wyangala Dam scheme
was to conserve 250,000 acre-feet of water for
domestic stock and small irrigation-plot purposes.
Contingent on the Government resuming 600,000
acres of mallee lands close to the Lachlan this
scheme is to be proceeded with right away.
Ten settlers proposed to put areas of wheat under
cultivation this year, but there was not a drop of
water within miles.
It is announced with some regularity that
new areas with wheat nossibilities have been
found, and that the blessed vegetable can
now be grown "further out.” The above is
a description of one of the N.SAN . < govern-
ment’s finds, not out in the barren Western
Division, but in the neighborhood of Lake
Garsrellico, about half-way across.
* * * *
The smaller variety of settler is a non-
unionist because a union could assure him
neither reasonable hours, pay sufficient to
live upon, nor any other definite advantage.
The Government doesn’t promote unionism
among his class by refusing, land to all appli-
cants who are not financial members of their
organisation, or by giving good unionists
some preference on the railways, and the
man on the land has the fullest permission to
be a disunited “scab.” He is a pieceworker
in the sense that he gets what lie can. In
that respect he resembles the coalminer, save
for the fact that he has no assured crop
while the miner has, but the miner is begin-
ning to be persistent in his demand for a
minimum wage, while the idea of the
Treasury assuring the selector of even 2s. 6d.
per acre per annum hasn’t yet been mooted.
The settler is also a day worker in so far that
his day may be as long and as often as he
likes, or as' he has to like. The new agri-
culturist. whose friends are always discover-
ing for him that there are great facilities
further out, lacks even the satisfaction of
knowing that lie is supplying “the needs of
the people” which the iron-trades unionist
would possess if he made £45,000.000 more
iron apparatus per annum. The new
agriculturist is merely toiling, in com-
petition with many miscellaneous stran-
gers, to provide a cheap loaf for the
"capitalists” and others of England. Gov-
ernments never cease in their efforts to
multiply the precarious non-unionist on the
land, perhaps because they really find mili-
tant unionism a great burden, and they have
spent £75,000,000 of loan money during
recent years in the struggle to plant him
there. The Storey Labor Ministry in
N.S.W. even devised a fearsome _ plan by
which it was to be empowered to seize almost
all the land in the State, pay for it, mort-
gages and all, in low-interest-bearing long-
dated paper, wipe the floor with the sheep
industry, and, if possible, put every mother’s
son and daughter on the land. Yet. owing to
its small proportion of wheat country, its scar-
city of available shipping ports, its distance
from the world’s chief market or something,
this great continent has a habit of ranking
ninth for quantity and 24tli or so for yield
per acre among the big wheat-suppliers of the
globe.
TWEEDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE.
While the air of New South Wales is
resounding with the defiant cries of Premier
JLang and thick with the dust of a legal
battle in which that gentleman has been
knocked flat, the Labor banner in other
States is being flourished much less aggres-
sively. On Saturday, March 26, Philip
Collier, of Westralia, and Lionel Hill, of
«outh Aus., have to face the electors. Both,
quite evidently, have been looking at the
prospect for a long while, and neither has
any use for the crackbrained measures and
bullying methods of Langism. The gospel
of .Labor, according to Collier, is that pro-
duction must be encouraged, "economic ser-
vices” improved and the standard of living
raised. His Government, he said, had
increased wages, reduced working hours and
put industry on a better footing. He then
devoted himself to wooing the country inter-
est by talking of closer settlement, the
encouragement of grape-growing and the
dried fruit industry, better water supplies,
assistance to. cattlemen desirous of going in for
sheep, and the like. All that Labor-unionists
were dazzled with was housing loans and State
insurance, and neither of those items involves
getting something for nothing. Most of
Hill’s speech could have been spoken by
any Premier of any party at any time. He
quoted statistics to show that people and
sheep and cattle were still getting born,
anu remarked with an air of conscious pride
that he hadn’t expropriated anything or any-
body—not even a bank. He admitted that
he Had borrowed a whale of a lot, but
promised to reform. His face beamed and
his eyes flashed when he produced figures
to show that there had been fewer strikes
anu less wages lost in his time than in that
of Barwell. Industrial arbitration, he
said, wasi dear to his heart, and he was
going to give all ihe preference he could to
the local manufacturer. It was a speech
that would have earned loud plaudits in
any Nationalist parlor.
Obviously those S, Aus. and Westralian elec-
tors who have no strong political prejudices
—and that applies to the majority—are going
to have trouble in making up their minds
whom and what to vote for. They have the
choice of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
There is nothing to indicate that any of the
existing parties is prepared to lead either
State out of the foreign-loan morass in which
it is floundering. There is no party with
any original idea as to what Australians
ought to do with the continent they have
inherited —possibly because political machines
distrust any idea that cannot be expressed
in a well-worn platitude, and possibly
because original ideas about continents hap-
pen only once in a thousand years. On
one side is a party which professes to be
socialist, and isn’t; on the other side, a
party which professes to be anti-socialist,
and isn’t. There are times, even in New
South Wales, wnere the doctrine of the
class-war is more sedulously fostered
than anywhere else in Australia, when the
non-Labor leader gets quite indignant about
the disbelief of some of his followers in
the efficacy of socialist measures, and there
are times when the unhumorous Lang grows
hot under the collar because his henchmen
will preach the doctrine of the co-operative
commonwealth at injudicious moments.
.* * * #
These signs and portents, taken altogether,
suggest that the time is near when there
should be less sham-fighting and a better
sense of political responsibility. So long as
Tweedledee can play ducks and drakes with
taxes and loans and escape responsibility by
pointing out that he did these things out of
pure hatred of Tweedledum, people whose
part in politics is simply to vote for other
people are going to have a bad spin. Their
only hope of relief lies in some such pooling
of liability as would be brought about by
the election of Ministers by Parliament. So
long as policies are divergent and political
doctrines at war the expedient may be im-
'practicahlie. But when policies converge
and doctrines are being gently laid away m
lavender, as is the case in most Australian
States at the present, moment, there is no
good reason why parties should not be repre-
sented as adequately in the Ministry as they
are in the country. After all, finance, which
is the most important thing Parliaments
have to squabble about in these days, is gov-
erned by rules that are arithmetical rather
than political. The best Treasurers in every
State have been men who have been con-
vinced about the doctrine of two and two
making four. And the fact that their party
shibboleths have not upset that belief has
been their strength and that of the country
they served. In an elected Ministry, the
Treasurer, even if he happened also to be
Premier, would have at least a few colleagues
who would help him to face unpleasant facts
and remember that even after political death
there is a judgment.
KUT.
One of the war books which will live to a
great age is the story of the-A.I.F. in Pales-
tine, published in Australia, and the work
of Henry S. Gullett, an Australian. An-
other is General Townsiiend’s narrative of
his disastrous campaign in Mesopotamia,
ending with the surrender at Kut-el-Amara,
a lonesome and solitary mishap which
flocked by itself. Very early in the war
Russia requested Britain to take the Turks
off its hands, it having too much (in addi-
tion to dirt) on its hands. The result
showed that the Russian command in Turk-
ish parts was too futile to be worth helping,
but the effort w T as made, and two of those
scattered expeditions which are a fatal dis-
sipation of military strength went forth.
One was sent to Gallipoli, which was impreg-
nable. The other was directed, to proceed
some hundreds of miles up the Tigris, which
is often unnavigable. This attack at the
two ends of Abdul Fez's country gave him
the inside running and the free use of his
Asiatic railway. A mixed land-and-sea force
should have found no insuperable . difficulty
in seizing a section of this commercial artery
in the neighborhood of Alexandretta, where
it lies close to the shore. But when J. 801 l
plays the military ass he does it with his
whole heart. The surrenders of Almanza,
Buenos Ayres, Saratoga, Yorktown and Ivut,
and old Elpiiinstone’s obliteration in Afghan-
istan, are amongst the evidences. The responsi-
bility for Gallipoli and Kut has been gener-
ally'charged to Winston Churciiill, the
political humorist who wore Paul Kruger's
exhumed belltopper and who responded to
the prayer of beleaguered Antwerp for long-
range guns by sending marines. *
The Tigris expedition seems to have worn
something of a doomed aspect from the first,
like the one with which General Hicks went
out to look for the Malidi, with the result
that he found that party at El Obeid. It
was greeted with some superficial friendli-
ness by the local Arab, of whom Towns-
iiend remarks that “he is the greatest turn-
coat in the world, and will always salaam to
those he thinks are winning.’’ Also Towns-
iiend states that“tha Arabs from the marshes,
who are well armed with rifles, and arc known
as great scoundrels and even murderers,”
lent what professed to be a hand by looting
stranded Turkish vessels and doing some
promiscuous killing, but they also cut the
throats of some British wounded and sniped
both sides till they could decide which had
the best chance. The general purpose of
the expedition was to get as far away from
the sea and its base as it could, to drive
the Turks back on their supplies and rein-
forcements, and, if possible, to achieve the
inland city of Bagdad, and discover if the
Arabian Nights Entertainments were still
running. The force was a small one, and
mostly Indian, and the Indians had an
insufficient supply of white officers to
steady them. The mixed army reached
Kut-el-Amara, on the up journey, with
success, and there it was supposed to
stay till its numbers were made up from
less than 14,000 to 30,000 or more, and
especially till the British element was
strengthened. But the boss Commander-in-
Cliief ordered it on to Ctesiphon and Bagdad,
though he didn’t go himself. It was at Kut
on the up journey that some Indian rein-
forcements came in, and of them Townsiiend
wrote: “I have never seen such a miserable
class of recruits in all my Indian experi-
ence.” One battalion belonging to north-
western India was sent back from Kut
because of “numerous cases of desertion to
the enemy.” Others held that there would
be no luck in an attack on Ctesiphon, because
a saintly old cobber of the Prophet was
buried there. The march was resumed with
part of the military tail still flourishing
bravely and the other section dragging on
the earth and making a furrow.
* * * #
The battle of Ctesiphon was won by a
narrow margin, the Ghurkhas and Punjaubis
doing well, and some other Indians being
fair to middling. It was won sufficiently to
make it possible to hang on while the
wounded were sent to the rear, and then,
one-third of the sketchy army being down
and out, and the landscape being like a
kaleidoscope with Turkish reinforcements,
the back track was taken. The retreating
army stopped at Kut on the down journey
and was bottled up. There were various
reasons. A considerable number of men,
having reached some sort of definite desti-
nation, fell down and slept for a day or
tw r o. If the part of the army which still
showed symptoms of insomnia went on. amid
swarms of Arabs and with the Turks in
brisk pursuit, there was no serious pros-
pect of reaching another defensible position
alive. If it was possible to keep ahead of
pursuit, there was nothing very positive to
retreat upon, except the sea, and the crippled
but embattled host hadn’t brought its bath-
ing-costume. No relief force which looked
anything like equal to the occasion had
arrived, nor did it arrive for a long and
dismal time. So it was decided to give
healthy and interesting to as
many as possible of the enemy at Kut, lest
Mesopotamia should be wholly lost. This
was done for nearly five months, till even
the starvation rations gave out and sur-
render became unavoidable. Kut is situated
at the bottom of a sac, with the Tigris on
three sides, and the enemy closed up the
land side with a Hindenburg line and made
all secure. Then the dilatory British relief
movement leaving Abdul with heaps of spare
time on his hands, he constructed six or eight
more Hindenburg lines on the road to the
coast, and shut one army out as he had
shut the other in. A Russian army of relict
was expected, and there really was a Rus-
sian army, but it wandered around Persia
committing petty larceny.
* * * *
The line of thought which led to the
selection of a featureless country, which
varies between bottomless mud and roofless
sandstorm, as a campaigning-ground has
never been made clear. Fifteen months after
Townsiiend’s failure at Ctesiphon, General
Maude, commanding 100,000 men, took Bag-
dad. disinfected it, and found that the Arab-
ian Nights Entertainments were no longer run-
ning, but Abdul took no notice. He oni>
declared war on the United States, and startei
a new and successful campaign against Rus-
sia, The British continued capturing odd places
beyond Bagdad for more than another year,
and Abdul apparently considered losses in
that out-of-the-way corner not worth getting
excited about. lie stuck steadily to his jon
of capturing Lenin’s towns and Trotskys
fortresses. Then an Anglo-Australian army,
fighting in Palestine and Syria, where a wmi
soldier could get a footing and the sea wa
handy, made a heroic wreck of one or m
best and biggest Fez armies, and began m
gather in Amurath’s Mediterranean sea
ports, and planted itself square on his gr •
Asiatic railway at Aleppo; and Abdul s
denly dispersed with a howl. hich s g
gested once more that the n.-e. corn ?* ,
the Levant should have been the ori,, ‘
point of attaek, and that Gallipoli and dc o
dad were pig-headed deviations. .
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Freehold Labor and Leasehold Labor.
There is a demand in N.S.W. and other
circles for a tremendous increase in aci -
(both Federal and State activity) about w
building of houses with big mortgage
tliem, and both Federal and State * of
ments discourse in millions —loan mi • £
course. And still there is no sign o ,
to cope with the really urgent need or
hour. This is for thousands of decent
not extravagant domiciles available to d ,
to the toiling masses, lhere are many 1
who can’t spend their lives in one spo
occupational reasons, and many n out .
hate to be chained to one street and on
look and one type of neighbor, a d je
know that they can’t move without
some commission shark to sell the P bollt
and another shark to hx up document.-, a a]]
the acquisition of other premises 0 „.
the same drawbacks. In any sane an ag
able set of circumstances, jt /houm
cheap and easy for a State department


build a house and let it for so much per week
m to make the pretence of selling it without
anv deposit and to speak of “instalments
instead of “rent.” It is proposed in N.b.W.
that the lower-wage man, for whom Labor-
ites are chiefly concerned, should buy his
house with 100 per cent, mortgage on it,
or in other words, that he should enter into
possession without parting with even halt
a week’s rent in advance. It would seem
tuat a better bargain could be made with
the common or garden tenant, w;hereby some
more or less costly legal formality would be
saved, but things are often not what they
seem. A feasible explanation is: —
That the Government is full of a deadly resolve
not to go in for landlording on any useful scale and
have its tenants drag it before its own Fair Rents
Court as the private landlord is dragged.
That it lacks the cynical courage to enact that the
Government is exempt from the jurisdiction of its
own F. R. Court, and then go in for supplying modest
homes on a generous scale, and charge its tenants
all it can get out of them, and more if possible.
That it has no idea how to make its F. li. Court a
reasonable institution, instead of one which made
the private landlord stop supplying new homes for
tenants, and tilled the Government with a solid
resolution not to start.
It may be regarded by some as an anomaly that
Laborites should make the leasehold or tenant
system such a fetich as regards farming and
pastoral lands, and try so hard to make the
freehold the only possible expedient for
the town-dweller. There is a craving to
supply the townsman with, or to force him
to supply himself with, “a home of bis
own,” though by reason of the long-distance
mortgage the chance of it ever becoming really
his own is limited. Along with this runs the
wild desire to prevent the man on the land
having “a home of liis own.” In Queens-
land and the Northern Territory the sale
of public land to liome-seekers was wholly
suppressed by Labor Governments, and in
Queensland the alienated area is about (! per
cent, of the whole and is decreasing. Theo-
dore’s old State, like N.S.W., lias a Fair
Kents Court to reduce the charge for small
homes, but the State’s tenants, who occupy
309,000,000 acres or more, have no access
to it. They were furnished, however, some
years ago, with a special Rent-Raising Court
of their own, which disregarded tlieir leases
and put up rents in some cases hundreds
per cent. It even very often made the
increases retrospective.
The attitude of Labor Governments towards
tlieir own tenants and towards other 'people’s
tenants is speckled all over with anomalies.
»
J. Bull’s Policy in China.
The situation in China is now sufficiently
well defined to satisfy all but Bolshevists
and their Labor friends. Tlie British Gov-
ernment lias gone so far to meet Chinese
nationalist sentiment that it lias confirmed
the seizure by a local mob of the British
concession at Hankow, merely making the
reasonable proviso that British ratepayers
should have equality of representation on
the municipal council with tlieir Chinese
fellow-residents. It lias also promised to
abandon its nationals to tlie modern Chinese
courts when tlie modern Chinese courts can
be located. To avoid interfering with the
interminable civil war, it has evacuated prac-
tically all its missionaries and traders in
the interior and concentrated them at Shang-
hai. It is not in a position to hand over
the Shanghai settlement even if it wanted to,
because the Shanghai settlement doesn’t
happen to belong to it. Tlie Shanghai settle-
ment is an ex-mudflat belonging to the
Chinese Government, which leased it to the
foreigner. It is an international con-
cession, and the consent of all the coun-
tries concerned would have to be obtained
before the lease could be abandoned. The
Cantonese say they are tlie Government of
China, and some military persons from
Peking, most of them ex-coolies, put for-
ward the same claim. In the circumstances
the leaseholders are legally obliged to wait
until the dispute between the alleged owners
is settled. The settlement lias a resident
white population of several thousands, which
has been swelled by refugees from all over
China. This white community is scattered
amongst a native population of over 01
millions, a million of whom are within tlie
borders of the settlement. The Chinaman
as an individual is the mildest person un-
hung, but in a mob lie is capable of almost
anything, including cannibalism. Tlie Shang-
hai mob has shown a disposition to seize
the settlement and eat the Europeans. Most'
of the European Governments and Uncle
Saji were slow in realising the seriousness
°f the situation, so Britain sent strong forces,
but by no means too powerful ones, to
defend European lives and international
property. It could not do less, and it lias
had sufficient provocation to make any Gov-
ernment but a stuffed one aclie to do a great
deal more.
—
Making ’Em Thrifty.
The Federal Commission that is looking into
the matter of national insurance in a leis-
urely fashion lias discovered that, in one
way and another, Australia is paying out
about £15,000,000 a year to destitute per-
sons. Its cogitations over this fact have
strengthened its belief, expressed in earlier
Progress reports, that something ought to he
done about it, and that the best remedy in
mght is a system of national insurance. In
Britain national insurance was made partly
a tax on employers, partly a deduction from
"’ages, and partly a matter of State con-
tributions, and the scheme that was to
encourage thrift developed in the fulness of
time into the encouragement of idleness. In
view of this experience it is clear that who-
ever frames an Australian scheme will have
to skate among some nasty pitfalls. About
the most successful attempt of the kind is
that put on the Maoriland Statute Book by
Joseph Warij 16 years ago, and the measure
of success achieved has not been great.
Any Maorilander between the ages of 16
nnd 50 can join tlie National Provident
b Ul 'd, provided lie or she doesn’t earn more
than £3OO a year on joining. The principal
object is to ensure payment of a superannua-
tion allowance at the age of 60. Entering at 16
the member pays 9d. a week for every 10s. of
weekly retiring allowance aimed at, with a
maximum contribution of 3s. and a maximum
allowance of 40s. There are maternity
bonuses, and allowances of 7s. 6d. a week
to widows and orphans, and it is an impor-
tant part of the plan that receipt of any of
the benefits is a clear legal right, not to be
vitiated by receipt of friendly society benefits,
and not disqualifying the recipient for the
old-age pension. The State subsidises all
contributions to the extent of 25 per cent,
and administei's the fund free. Actuarily, the
scheme has proved its soundness. Each year
contributions • substantially exceed out-
goings, and a fund is being built up which
will undoubtedly prove more than adequate
to the demands made upon it in years
to come, when the proportion of pensioners
will be much greater than it is at present.
In 1925, for instaixce, the income was
£815,456, and the expenditure £102,778, and
at the end of the year there was £1,480,740
in the pool. The disappointing feature of
the results is the relatively small number
of contributors. Each year has shown an
increase, but in 1925 the total number of
contributors was only 25,768. This despite
the fact that friendly societies and local
bodies have been given facilities for trans-
ferring some of their liabilities in the matter
of benefits and superannuation allowances to
the fund. Not more than five out of every
100 wage-earners are contributors. The
original intention was to make contributions
compulsory, but that was found to be imprac-
ticable, on political as well as on other
grounds.
A voluntary sqlxeme like that of Maori-
land might work well in Australia, but, with
the disastrous result of the British compul-
sory scheme sticking up like a danger-signal,
compulsion is out of the question. Anyway,
before the Bkuce-Tages start monkeying
with plans for making people thrifty, they
should set an example of thrift themselves.
#
Muddling Along with the Finances.
“Bildad” : The Federal Government toddles
along with its financial proposals, which
grow more mixed with age and more muddled
with closer acquaintance. They now include
an allowance of £878,099 per annum to Tas-
mania for two years, the island being a con-
stant loser through the partial, and some-
times complete, isolation forced on it by the
Navigation Act and some other influences.
In addition, it has the smallest revenue per
head, it taxes its impoverished people most
heavily in the effort to make ends meet,
and it is making the biggest effort to be
honest and to keep off the loan market. So
it deserves sympathy. There is also to be
an allowance of £809,000 per annunq for
five years to 'Westralia, it being the State
with the biggest revenue and the biggest
loan expenditure per head, and having such
a fixed objection to paying its way that
its people are the most lightly-taxed, the
Victorians only excepted. In addition, the
expensive Federal railway is Westralia’s
guarantee against isolation. Only for the
face that the Commonwealth has got into the
habit of being scared of its largest child,
the position would be puzzling. The pro-
fessed and intense desire of the Bruce-
Page Government is to separate State and
Federal finance, but these propositions sug-
gest that the thing is impossible, as other
countries have discovered. The Common-
wealth has borrowed a few more millions on
behalf of the States and intends to contiiiue
doing so indefinitely, and if N.S.W. joins
m and appoints the Commonwealth its bor-
rowing agent as its neighbors have done,
the business will assume very big proportions.
The Central Authority hopes to be always
able to rely on the States for full interest
on these borrowings, and that looks more like
further entanglement of finance than separa-
tion. Then the admission that the Brtjce-
Page combination thinks it necessary to
stick to part of the income-tax puts a blight
on the glad (or sorry) promise of the Com-
monwealth’s “complete withdrawal from the
field of direct taxation.” It says it would
like to withdraw if possible, but if there
must be two income-taxes mild confusion
must still prevail. Still, its desires are
obvious enough, as follows:
To give State politicians of the Lang type the
largest possible exclusive field or paddock of taxa-
tion to cavort in.
To further reduce Federal control.
By abolishing the allowance of so much per head
per annum from the Commonwealth to the States
to put the former in the position that it can’t deduct
interest in default from the defaulting State’s allow,
ance, there being no allowance to deduct from.
The duplication of taxes is a nuisance and a
snare, especially in such big matters as pro-
bate and succession duties, income-tax and
land-tax. If the Commonwealth made an
offer to swear off the land-tax absolutely,
and to buy up the sole right to the others
with a liberal increase of the per capita
allowance, it would at least be attempting
something large in the way of the simplifica-
tion of accounts. There is no more merit
in the complete severance of Federal and
State funds than xn the complete severance
of husband and wife—in fact, of husbands
and wives in general. It may be a fad of
the moment, but even for the moment the
fad seems to have very few Parliamentary
friends, though it may gain party support.
Party support is one of the blighting evils
of our civilisation.
♦
Singapore as a Safety-valve.
While the British Empire is being abused
for monopolising too much of the surface of
the globe, the charitable effort of Singapore
should not be ignored. Malaya seems to be
engaged on a huge experiment similar to
America’s transportation of the negro, except
that it is infinitely more humane. The
quarantine station at Singapore is an immi-
gration depot second only to Ellis Island in
the variety and number of its colored mer-
chandise. There are no vexatious restric-
tions on the migrant who arrives at Singa-
pore. There are no inquiries into his ances-
try or his ability to support himself or his
family in the new land of his adoption. Pro-
vided he is not suffering from leprosy, cholera
or other infectious troubles, he can walk
with his lacquered suitcase off the ship’s deck
straight into the vast undeveloped hinter-
land of Malaya. For vast and undeveloped it
is, despite the rapid gi-owth of rubber and
other industries introduced by the white man.
The Malay Archipelago is still mainly
unpenetrated jungle, and it is as big as Eng-
land and Scotland put together. There is
Borneo, almost as untouched as Australia's
Northern Territory, and outside the British
possessions there are Sumatra, Celebes and
Dutch New Guinea, almost as potentially rich
as Java, but carrying only a fraction of its
population. Consequently the immigration
business clone at Singapore is big. Between
January and November of last year an army
of 587,000 coolies entered and 332,000 left
the island. The balance, 255,000, was nearly
twice that recorded for 1925 and three times
the figure for 1924. Amongst the polyglot
invasion, mainly of Tamils and Chinese, there
was a large sprinkling of Cantonese ex-
soldiers and retired bandits. The Chinese
have the unpleasant habit of bringing their
secret societies with them, and this unpre-
cedented deluge has been difficult to absorb.
There have been awkward incidents, but the
Straits police have had nearly 100 years of
experience in struggling with the tongs
and hueis of China. There are still Britons
whose job it is to walk into their offices
in clean white ducks and then slip out of
the back door in an umbrella hat and a
patched pair of pants, armed only with a
knowledge of half a dozen Chinese dialects
and a curious acquaintance with the murky
rites of the secret societies.
The starting of the naval base and the
rise in the price of rubber have been a big
stimulus to this coolie influx, and its_ quiet
absorption will depend on the steady invest-
ment of British capital. The southern China-
man seems to thrive in the tropics, and
though at first lie sends all but a bare mini-
mum of his wages home, most of him event-
ually settles down. As an outlet for _ the
surplus population of Britain, Malaya isn’t
of much more jralue than Garden Island.
But as a safety-valve for the high yellow
pressure in Fukien, Kwangtung and other
ill-regulated Celestial paradises it should be
given some credit.
Another Lang Fiasco.
It is not often that John Stuart Mill is
cited as an authority in a court of law, and
the latest case in which the Full High Court
of the Commonwealth was asked to pass
judgment on a fool-measure bludgeoned
through the N.S.W. Assembly is likely to have a
special niche in legal history on that account
alone. Mill was the only authority quoted
by the State Attorney-General when lie tried
to persuade the High Court that his Gov-
ernment’s tax of a half-penny per copy on
daily newspapers and certain other publica-
tions was a constitutional impost, though
Queen ANNE was hopefully mentioned.
McTiernan ought to have known that a tax
imposed on any article produced in the
country of its origin is an excise tax by
every legal rule of definition, and he ought
to have known that the right to impose excise
taxes has been for a quarter of a century the
prerogative of the Federal Government.
Whether either he or Dr. Evatt, another
legal member of the Labor caucus, advised
their political chief to that effect is obscure.
Willis, leader of the Leg. Council, told that
body that the Cabinet had never had an
opinion before it, which seems to show that
the Cabinet had a notion of what the legal
verdict would be ; Lang’s view, as represented
in a newspaper report of caucus proceedings,
was that he knew his measure couldn’t stand
fire, but he wanted to let the public know
(at its expense, of course) how horribly the
Federal power constricted the field of taxa-
tion for any poor struggling State Govern-
ment. When the numbers went up for the
High Court Handicap Evatt and McTier-
nan wore the colors of rival stables. Evatt
was briefed by one of the newspapers that
wanted Lang put under restraint, arid
McTiernan’s brief pledged him to an argu-
ment so hopeless that he had to cite a non-
legal authority to the effect that communi-
cations are a fit subject for taxation, and
then listen to the Bench demolishing the
flimsy contention that because newspapers are
a means of communication they are not a
manufactured product. By the unanimous
voice of the Court the tax was declared
invalid, as was the S. Aus. petrol tax —a
recent precedent which the thick-headed
Lang ignored. So, after inflicting great
inconvenience and expense on the community,
another piece of N.S.W. Labor legislation has
crashed. There are heavy costs to be borne
by the taxpayer, who has had to pay an
illegal impost, by him irrecoverable, for two
months, and claims to compensation for law-
less exactions will no doubt be made and
may have to be met. How all the wrong that
has been done is going to be righted will be
one more problem to be solved by a Premier
whose ability in solving political problems is
never likely to win him even a consolation
prize. Drivelling incompetency in office was
never more vividly illustrated than in this
newspaper-tax fiasco.

Nationalist Methods in Dailey.
“Blum” : You can judge a man by the com-
pany lie keeps—if lie doesn’t keep any you
fear the worst and hope for the best —and
you can judge a political party by its election-
eering cartoons. If it doesn’t use such things
the same rule applies. I never really knew
tlie N.S.W. National Federation until I saw
the pictures with which it attempted to keep
Theodore out of the Dailey seat. Election-
eering cartoons are intended to say pictorially
things that the party putting them out
doesn’t care to say verbally. The Dailey
Nationalist cartoons showed Mr. Theodore
officiating as boss of a two-up school; Mr.
Theodore as the crowned king of Queens-
land ; Mr. Theodore as the owner of a
small bungalow and a very tiny motor-car
shaped like a yellow cab; Mr. Theodore
entering the Queensland Club in golfing kit;
Mr. Theodore chatting over investments
with some plutocratic friends ; Mr. Theodore
preaching socialism to the Dallcyites and get-
ting badly heckled by horny-handed work-
ers who seem to have been reading the
National Review ; Mr. Theodore in the
lounge of the Australia Hotel receiving con-
gratulations from capitalists; and, 'finally,
Mr. Theodore lamenting that he ever advo-
cated the “nationalisation of wealth and
prosperity” because it means the loss of his
“stocks and shares.” his “exclusive club” and
his “nice home.” The intention was to show
that Theodore is a delusion and a snare and
a false alarm; and so he may be. But it
was bad advertising. The average working-
class elector of Dailey thought about Gee
as soon as he saw the cartoons. Everything
that was said about Theodore in the picture-
language could be applied with equal force
to Gee, who as the wooer of an electorate
that was known to have pi’onounced Labor
sympathies was putting the soft pedal on his
non-Labor views. Gee to unfriendly eyes
looked as big a political humbug as Theo-
dore. There was nothing the plutocrats said
to Theodore in the cartoons that they were
not more likely to say to Gee. Gee is a
likeable-looking young man who may possibly
have a political future, but he has some very
stupid friends. The Conservative working-
man —which means any working-man who has
a house of his own and a job that he values —
noted that Theodore, in the estimation of
his political enemies, was a man with a stake
in the country, and as such exceedingly un-
likely to try to form a Soviet. The other
working-men either didn’t see the Nationalist
cartoons at all or put them down to spite
against a comrade. The Nationalist fault
was the transgression of the first rule of
advertising—talk about your own goods. and
leave the other fellow’s goods alone. If the
Nationalists had any real message for the
folk of Dailey, if they had a better political
recipe than Theodore’s, it was their busi-
ness to trot it out. But they chose merely
to abuse the other side. And mere abuse
will get their party nowhere.
Bush-fires and Brigades.
Dear Bulletin, —“C.Q.” (B. 24/2/’27) has
certainly offered some practical suggestions
for an organisation to cope with the out-
breaks which happen in Victoria as regu-
larly as arbitration awards, but, like all the
other inexperts who burst into print at this
season of the year, he arrives at the obvious
by ignoring the essential—finance. It is this
aspect of the question which has assisted
expert recommendations into departmental
pigeon-holes times without number. When the
bush-fire question comes under discussion it
is fashionable to point to what is done in
U.S.A. or 1 Canada or some other country
where conditions are dissimilar to those in
A’ietoria, 50 per cent, of whose population is
crowded into a small black square at the
bottom of the map. The suggestion that the
other 50 per cent, should be bled through their
municipal rates and fire-insurance premiums
to provide the major portion of the cost of
establishing and maintaining volunteer bri-
gades to protect the rest of the State (a
lot of which still belongs to the Crown)
helps to shelve the matter until a dry sum-
mer comes again. Even a volunteer organi-
sation and fire-beaters and bush-fire carts
would cost a lot of money to instal and main-
tain on the necessary scale.- If “C.Q.” wishes
to test his popularity he might attempt the
job of convincing a Victorian shire-councillor
that one pound spent on fire-fighting equip-
ment in the winter may save a hundred
pounds’ worth of property in the summer.
The present economically unsound system
of loading two-tlnrds of the odium of col-
lecting fire-brigade contributions on to the
shoulders of the municipalities and insurance-
companies must be abolished, and direct taxa-
tion substituted,, before adequate protection
can be attempted by the present body, which
has the nucleus of the machinery for the
job. Country municipalities, with their
limited field of taxation, already find it an
effort to share the cost of maintaining volun-
teer brigades, as periodical howls at the
Country Fire Brigades Board on account of
its policy of replacing hand hose-reels with
motor-pumps testify. The function of an
insurance company is to accept a-specified risk
at a rate fixed accordingly, and the risk having
been accepted to await claims; if any. When
Victoria lias, a.. Government strong enough
to face the situation and to grant statutory
powers to the proper authority to compel
landowners to plough and burn fire-breaks,
the matter of organisation will be compara-
tively simple. My estimate of the cost of an
adequate volunteer bush-fire organisation is
at least £50,000 per annum, this being based
on the cost of the present volunteer organi-
sation, which is the most efficient and econo-
mical of- its kind in the world. The amount
is small in comparison with the annual loss
to the community under present conditions,
and 124 per cent, of it represents the cost of
training and supervising the brigades by
permanent officials. The mere issue of equip-
ment would be futile. If someone will give
me £25,000 p.a. to start with, I’ll take on the
job, remuneration to be on the basis of a
small commission on the value of the pro-
perty saved.
The term “bush-fire” is loosely used to
cover both forest-fires and grass-fires, but, as
every bushman knows, there is a wealth of
difference between the two. The only way
to deal effectively with forest-fires is not
to have them. Money spent in cleaning up
and making wide breaks, with severe penal-
ties for grazing lessees who acquire the fire-
stick habit, would obviate a lot of dashing
about with beaters when it is too late.
Experience this year has confirmed the sus-
picion that a big proportion of both forest-
and grass-fires is deliberately caused. With
volunteer brigades established throughout
the State it might be possible to develop a
community spirit of hostility towards indis-
criminate burners-off. It would also be pos-
sible to deal properly with gentry such as
the landowner who last year ordered motor-
cars ad lib. to convey volunteers to fight a
fire on his property when it got out of his
control, and repudiated the garage accounts,
which were paid by the volunteer firemen
who had helped to save his home. —Yours,
etc., Brigadier.

In the Hunter River Valley.
In 1918 the Workers’ Educational Associa-
tion established a Federal Council. Through
this body it was conceived possible to gather
together in some systematic form the mass of
material which had been collated by the
professors, lecturers and tutors who had
given their services in promoting the objects
of the association. It was thought that
the most direct and valuable way of giving
effect to this desire would be by the publica-
tion of books on economic and political
problems arising in Australia. As the pur-
pose of this step was to stimulate thought
and not to propagate doctrines, the W.E.A.
expressly disclaims responsibility for the
views expressed by the writers of these
books, who on their part do not anticipate
that what they have to say will have an
equal appeal to all readers.
In the latest of the series (No. 9) F. R.
E. Mauldon describes and analyses the
industrial life of the people of the Hunter
River valley of N. S. Wales, tracing the
relationships between them and the material

conditions encircling them. The book, being
one intended for the student more particu-
Jarly, goes exhaustively into an inquiry as to
the permanent factors of the physiography
of the valley, prescribing the extent and
quality of the natural material gifts which
the people use, and then into an examina-
tion of the industries of the district. But
there is much to interest the general reader.
In concluding his lucid and informative
study the author offers some particularly
interesting comments on distinctive types of
workers in this district of N. S. Wales. With-
out pushing his conclusions to any absolute
point he finds that people engaged in pastoral
activity as a whole are more open-minded,
as they are more open-hearted, than people
confined to the dairy farm or the agricultural
plot. “Expansiveness of outlook,” he writes,
“has some connection with the expansiveness
of the sheep- or stock-run.” On the other
hand, the farmer is “apt to be a man of nar-
rowed interests, suspicious, tight-fisted, un-
scientific and conservative.” These qualities
are likely to be accentuated where men with
exceptionally good land have succeeded
despite the handicap of illiteracy. Such a
type the author found on the l'ich lucerne-
growing flats along the Hunter. “They are
distinctly hostile to new ideas on agriculture,
on the assumption that agricultural science
can have little to teach ‘practical men’ who
have succeeded.” The success of the older
farmers he finds to be due mainly to rises in
land values consequent on the growth of
local markets in Newcastle and the other
mining communities, but they have “deluded
themselves into the belief that it is because
of good methods of farming.” Mr. Maui.don
looks to the new generation, to whom better
education is giving a different outlook, to
bring matters up to date. Incidentally, lie
suggests that “the degree to which inter-
marriage has gone on during three or four
generations in some rural districts” has been
a cause of lowered mental efficiency.
In contrast to the individualism of the
farmers, the author sets “the craft con-
sciousness and unity” of the miners. Separa-
tion into scattered holdings may weaken' the
sense of solidarity among the former, whereas
the grouping together in communities with
one main interest may strengthen it in the
case of the other. “Miners, as a whole,” he
writes, “exhibit a consciousness of craft and
class which comes little short of hostility to
those in other callings.” The smaller the
coalmining community, isolated from other
centres, the stronger this feeling. “It is as
dangerous as it may be unfair,” the author
proceeds, “to indulge in rash generalisation.
Yet the truculence which many miners show
when they believe they are exercising a
commendable independence, the disregard of
others’ rights.... the irresponsibility of the
younger men in their attitude to the elder
men and to authority generally—these are
the symptoms of occupational characteristic,
even though they are the practices of minori-
ties.” He arrives at the conclusion that if
farming as an occupation tends towards in-
dividuality, “mining, with its widespread
organisation controlling the action of indi-
viduals, seems to make for weakening of
individual initiative.” Miners are never free
from the consciousness of “the strength and
weight of the crowd.” The miner loses in
moral fibre and ceases to develop a strong
initiative of his own; “this is proved re-
peatedly in the mass decisions taken, which
are not a reflex of aggregate honest indi-
vidual opinion.”
These W.E.A. books are useful, but it is
improbable that Maui/don’s essay will be a
best-seller in the Hunter River valley.

The Betting Businesss Scores.
“Bouragi” : The bill to “amend” the N.S.W.
Gaming and Betting Act. introduced to the
Leg. Assembly in a snufflebusting speech by
“Colonial” Secretary Lazzarini, might be
called with justice the Ikey Endowment Bill.
It makes a parade of abolishing the profes-
sional tipster, while doing nothing to that
infinitely greater offender the starting-price
parasite, who could be wiped out by substi-
tuting an embargo on the publication of
weights for the present silly interdict on the
publication of odds. And it permits the
Menangle Park course to be reckoned outside,
although it is actually inside, the 40-mile
limit, which means that 16 more meetings
per annum are to be inflicted on a community
in which over-racing is already a scandal
and embezzlement for betting purposes _‘s
rife. And the measure permits an extensive
increase of trotting meetings in city and coun-
try, including a span of 25 days for New-
castle alone. Lazzarini, of course, asserted
that the trotter is “a utility horse.” This
description may have been true of the old
buggy trotter once so popular in Australia,
but it is certainly not true of the lolloping,
bumble-footed brutes known nowadays as
trotters. Worthless for any other purpose
than track racing in elaborate and special
rigs, the contemporary trotter’s sole reason
for existence is that he is a gambling machine
with particular recommendations to ingeni-
ous manipulators of form. The conditions
of trotting race's- —the “breaking” rule, to take
only one instance —render it much easier and
safer to make a trotter lose than is the case
with horse- or even pony-racing; this is so
widely accepted that “the Red Hots” is a
universal synonym in Australia for the
“sport” of trotting. Trotters have proved
themselves quite worthless as utility sires,
even when crossed with blood mares, for the
bad characteristics due to their specialised
breeding and training invariably mark their
nondescript progeny. Half the weeds which
infest the country under the good old name
of “waler” are infected with imported trot-
ting “blood,” the craze for which is largely
responsible for the falling off in quality of
the Australian riding horse. But the gamb-
ling interest will profit by the extension of the
trotting plague, and so, in a measure, will
the liquor interest. Both interests are sur-
prisingly influential when the New Laborism
is in office.

Strange things are liable to happen at
the Federal capital. One idea is to offer
for lease small combined orchards and hen-
farms, with a five-roomed weatherboard shack
on each, within three miles of the civic
centre. Weatherboard is a relic of barbarism,
especially in the suburbs of a continental
capital and where the temperature drops to
IS' below zero. The size of these farmlets
is to be from 30 to 38 acres, and the rents
£93 to £lO2 for the first five years, and £l2O
to *143 for the remaining 20. These are
rents —not prices. One-fifth of each area
must be permanent orchard, but the other
four-fifths need not be sown with hens, pro-
vided the lessee gets permission to plant some
other “approved” crop. He is not to sell
anything outside the Federal territory with-
out the “special consent” of the local rulers,
but it looks as if it would be very difficult
to legally prevent competition from outside.
Also there is, or was in 1924, some private
land or land in process of alienation (about

“Kwinana” : The cyclone which played
havoc with Cairns and the outlying sugar
districts on February 9 at least fully estab-
lished the value of the radio and meteorologi-
cal station at Willis Island. Ever since its
inception in 3921 this Federal station has col-
lected valuable data, and in this case it gave
Cairns and the shipping along the coast four
clear days’ warning of the formation of a
disturbance. During the subsequent period,
before Cairns was hit, the intensity and direc-
tion of the cyclone were correctly mapped out
by the Commonwealth Weather Bureau, cal-
culations being based solely on the Willis
Island reports. (The landline system north
of Townsville had been interrupted for weeks
beforehand, and no coastal reports were
available.) Six vessels, the Malabar, Melu-
sia, Marella, Mallina, Canberra and Canon-
bar, which were heading straight for the
blow were warned off; they anchored and
sheltered away from the disturbance. Tele-
graphically and telephonically, Cairns was
isolated from the outside world five hours
before the cyclone struck the town, and
thus deprived of official weather warnings.
Fortunately, the Urilla was in port, and
early next morning communication was estab-
lished radiotelegraphically with Townsville;
but for the Urilla’s presence two or three days
would have elapsed before communication by
mail could have been established. Cairns is
still deprived of landline communication, and
will be for some time to come. It has the
strongest case for the inauguration of a radio
service.

“Centurion” : The vexed question of battle
honors for the colors of A.I.F. units has at
last been settled. The British War Office
has added to its own official list the names of
those engagements which A.I.F. units speci-
ally asked should be recorded on the colors.
Where the Australians had a special name
for an engagement, it is to be hyphenated
with the official name or added in brackets.
Typical examples are “Sari Bair —Lone
Pine” and “Albert, 1918 (Chuignes).” The
change is the more important since it makes
possible the recording of individual actions in
general movements which stand specially to
the credit of Australian troops; Beersheba,
in Palestine, and Hamel, in France, are two
famous instances. The regiments and bat-
talions of the C.M.F. will display the honors
won by the corresponding unit of the A.I.F.
“F.S.”: The ill-fated Victorian war memorial
continues its peregrinations. It was first
proposed to place it on St. Kilda-road, but
there were fears that the money required,
£150,000, would not be realised. Enthusiasm
was then evoked for the resumption of two
hotels at the top of Bourke-stfeet, where a
dignified square, backed by Federal Govern-
ment House, would have provided an effective
and accessible site. The latest proposal put
forward by a sub-committee of the execu-
tive is to plant the memorial on the old
Melbourne High School site, not far from
the Exhibition. Poor houses, which will
eventually be replaced with factories and
warehouses, infest this locality, so the new
proposal is no improvement on the old. If
some conclusion is not come to soon, there is
danger of public interest evaporating alto-
gether in the mists of oblivion.
O
“J.D.”: “Akmidale” (B. 24/2/’27), writing
about Chinese in British Columbia logging
camps, has got his facts mixed. In a saw-
mill in British Columbia a man may have a
Dago, a Malay or an Afghan for a mate, but
in the logging camps the only position an
Asiatic occupies is that of cook or servant,
and the Hastings Lumber Co. is the only,
firm of note that employs Asiatics even in
those capacities. The work in the woods is
both hard and fast, a fact which keeps out the
Chinaman, and where signals are given by
word of mouth the language difficulty proves
another bar. Timber falling is done chiefly
by Swedes and Norwegians, who can use an
axe dexterously and nick up the language
quickly. Wages in British Columbia are
higher than Australian rates of pay, but
scientific handling makes for cheaper costs

“Feng-Shui” : It is to be hoped that the
Australian dailies will get used to these
luxury ships crammed with alleged Ameri-
can millionaires. The gibes thrown at them
by some papers and the awed fuss made of
them by others suggest the growth of an
inferiority complex, possibly due to the fact
that Australian millionaires, when they go on
similar trips to places like Tasmania, have
to travel in vessels little better than timber
droghers, and are liable to be left stranded by
the insolence of a sozzled fireman. Inciden-
tally, I am reminded of a whole nation which
greeted an American massed tour with a
silence that was thrilling. Every year th'
(100,000 inhabitants of Bali, Dutch East
Indies, celebrate a sanitary festival, known
as hari nycpleli. The entire population lowers
its blinds and retires behind its mud walls
for 24 hours. At the end of 'the period every-
body sets up a frightful hullabaloo on the
family petrol tin, and the startled spirits of
disease leap out of windows, whereupon naked
priests armed with branches drive them into
the Java Sea. The first massed tour to Bali
announced its proposed arrival date by cable,
but the island having gone into retirement, as
above stated, the wire was not delivered, and
when the floating apartment house anchored
nobody came off to greet it. Whereupon the
400-odd travellers debouched upon the shore,
puzzled but curious. After an exhausting
tramp in the stifling noonday heat through
villages which appeared to have been smitten
by a pestilence, they reached a temple occu-
pied solely by dogs, pigs and the sculptured
heads of sanguinary-looking devils, and,
needless to say, their* nerves were getting
frazzled. At this moment the hullabaloo
previously mentioned broke out and the naked
priests duly descended on them. Nobody
could blame them if they broke and fled, leav-
ing a deposit of umbrellas, cameras and
binoculars scattered on the highway, and.
crowding back into their boats, insisted on
the skipper forthwith departing. Ma Pati-
mah, of Buleleng, Bali, gave me the above
information, and I never disbelieve a lady.

“S.A.C.”: The old complaint that recruits
cannot be attracted to the N.S.W. Police
Force is making itself heard again. The pay
(15s. a day) is the highest in Australia,and
there are many allowances and privileges,
the 44-hour week among them, plus a good
measure of unionism and political “pull."
Educational requirements are not exacting,
even those dealing with physical fitness arc-
anything but prohibitive, and the height stan-
dard has recently been lowered. But the fact
remains that the N.S.W. force cannot get
the right type of recruit in sufficient num-
bers. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police
and the South African Constabulary never
have any difficulty on that score, although
the pay and privileges they offer are far in-
ferior. The reason may lie in the fact that the
Canadian and Afrikander police are organised
as national bodies, and are, to all intents and
purposes, military forces, with no Trades Hall
demagogues to impair the discipline which is
as essential to police as to soldiers. The time
is not far off in Australia when the police
forces must become a Federal organisation.
At present, in every State, influence is honey-
combing the ranks, and the spectacle is wit-
nessed of policemen openly bidding for, and
receiving, the favors of low-grade politicians
and industrial agitators. The result is that
decent fellows with a liking for the life and
the service hesitate about joining, and then'
is an increasing tendency to recruit from
the rabble of ward-heelers and political
hangers-on. An Australian police force, well
paid, well pensioned and rigidly selected,
would command the respect of people in
whom heterogeneous and variously trained
and controlled bodies of constables only in-
spire contempt. It would put the fear of the
Law in the heart of the push. Brought
under Commonwealth control, the men would
be freed from the pettifogging electoral and
other paper-serving jobs which the States
pile on them, and the Federal force might
be organised on the lines of the C.M.F. In
which case it would become _as free from
political and other improper influence as is
the Royal Australian Navy or Air Force.

POLITICAL
POINTS
It might have been thought that the
N.S.W. Government must resign or seek a
dissolution when it began to be defeated in
both Houses, and its bills and devices, com-
menced to slide overboard in a steady stream,
and its child endowment was hung up, and
the Governor declined to bloat the Council
any further, and the High Court unani-
mously ruled out its excise duty on news-
papers, and it was found discreet to aban-
don the alternative scheme of an excise duty
on advertisements, and Premier Lang’s
friend and supporter, Seale, was suspended
from the presidency of the Australian Labor
party, and it was found necessary to stop
the announced “intensive campaign” against
the Upper House and the Governor, because
the first meeting revealed that the campaign
was damp and wouldn’t light. But the
Langs and McTiernans are stayers. Even
when the country and the Assembly and the
Governor give them formal notice to go out
the chances are that a motor-lorry will have
to call for them and take them away.
Recently-issued figures show that Austra-
lia’s millennium arrived more than a year
ago, and hardly anybody noticed it. At
least the aggregate debt attained to over
1000 millions, having risen 65 millions in
12 months, and that looks millennial enough.
Premier Collier, Speaker Walker and six
other Westralian Labor Assemblymen were
without opponents when nominations closed
the other day. Another 18 seats will give
the party a majority of one on the floor of
the House. It is cocksure of 18 and confi-
dent of several more, thanks to the electoral-
boundaries swindle and the eleventh-hour
manipulation of the pick-and-shovel vote.
The Prime Minister was in his element
when he waved his lily-white hands in a
two-hours-long oration about the diplomatic
doings with which he had been associated in
Europe. One remark stood out in the report:
Mr. Bruce said that Australia was resolved never
again to be involved in a war about which it had
not been consulted.
Both Serbia and Belgium tried to maintain
that attitude in 1914, but what is the use of
an attitude if a big enemy is bursting big
shells on top of it V
Despite the protests of Laborites who
have some regard for the old ideals of
their degenerate party and for Australian
industries, the grossly mishandled N.S.AV.
Liquor Amendment Bill was passed in its
original muddled form. Publicans who sell
English beer, Scotch whisky and Irish stout
are to be allowed to serve the same at meals
from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., but the corresponding
privilege is now denied to restaurateurs (the
HIS NIGHT- (AND DAY-) iMAYORS .
“The programme for the entertainment of the Yorks in N.S.W. is a dull grind of official events.
For example: March 26, Town Hall reception; March 28, Pud Mayor gives a ball; March 30, recep-
tion at Town Hall; March 31, shire councillors to receive distinguished guests.”
Government is one itself) licensed to sell
Australian wine. It has been a triumphant
session for Bung and the Bookie, but Aus-
tralian industries and Labor principles have
got it in the neck.
If the Allancock Government survives
the Vic. election, it will reintroduce the 14
p.c. tax on bookmakers’ turnover which
was lost last session owing to Political
Labor’s tender consideration for McShort-
odds. Farmer Allan gave this pledge in his
policy-speech at Kyabram on Monday night.
At almost the same hour the N.S.AV. Labor
Government got Parliamentary authority for
a bill that will enable the Ma State Mc-
Shortodds, registered and unregistered, to
bet on 36 more meetings p.a. in Sydney and
district. i"'d 28 more in Newcastle and
district. But, then, the Allancocks are
Tories, and tin; Langs and Lazzarinis are
the Workers’ Friends.
The trade figures for the calendar year
1926 are out, and it appears that Australia
produced so little and depended on foreign
produce so much that imports of merchandise
exceeded exports by £26,000,000. When that
and the £30,000,000 or so which Australia
has to pay abroad annually for interest and
sundries is charged, or when someone
attempts to charge it, to loans things may
possibly happen. It is certainly not a time
for any light-hearted Bench to take the
chance of reducing production by scattering
44-hour decisions around.
Another industrial fight to a finish is
taking place in Brisbane. One Dorothy
Bryan, having been refused membership of
the union, applied for cancellation of the
preference clause of the bar-attendants’
award. The Court ordered the union to
admit Dorothy as a member. This it refused
to do, alleging that there was little work
doing in the pubs, which sounds queer for
Queensland. The preference clause was can-
celled accordingly, so Dorothy is leading on
points.
S. Aus. Labor Premier Hill won’t need
to worry about his seat on March 26 ; Port
Pirie gave Hill and J. C. Fitzgerald a walk-
over. The same thing happened to J. N.
Pedler and S. li. Richards in Wallaroo,
another Labor stronghold. On the other
hand, E. H. Giles and H. G. Tossell were
returned unopposed in Yorke Peninsula, as
also were H. S. lludd, G. R. Laffer and P. T.
lleggaton in Alexandra, so the Lib.-Cockies
are one up. The surprise of the nominations
was the appearance of independent Labor
candidates in Adelaide and Port Adelaide,
where selection-ballot winners have hitherto
had matters all their own way; in Barossa,
moreover, Dr. Basedow, who polled well as
a Country-party nominee three years ago, is
standing in opposition to both tickets. The
fate of the Ministry will be decided in three-
member electorates like Barossa, Sturt, East
Torrens, Wooroora and Murray. Hill is
hopeful, but his task is much stilfer than
Gunn’s was in 1924.
It is raining conferences and committees
and commissions in Melbourne. There is to
be a conference of Premiers to talk about
child endowment; there is to be an “inde-
pendent” commission to consider the Bruce-
Page proposals regarding Federal-and-State
finance (the latest proposals, that is to say,
for they are changed every month) ; there
is to be a joint committee of Senators and
Representatives to inquire into the moving-
picture business; and so on. The movie
investigation was suggested by Labor-Senator
Grant, who, abandoning his queer Cobden-
ism in this instance, has the honorable ambi-
tion to help in the building of a great Aus-
tralian film industry; but the indications
are that it will be merely a substitute for
governmental action. A craving for sucli
substitutes is the bane of the Bruce-Page
crowd.
The war that is rending the N. S. Wales
A.L.P. in twain and, incidentally, threaten-
ing disaster to Premier Lang is merely a
new phase of the old vendetta between
Willis, sometime secretary of the Coalminers’
Union, now M.L.C. and Lang's right-hand
man, and Bailey, ex-M.L.A., the A.AV.IJ.
stalwart. For years the strife lias raged
with varying results. Willis seemed to have
scored a k.o. when he was instrumental in
getting Bailey expelled from the party over
the “crook ballot-box” disclosures, and when
Theodore, an arbitrator from outside accepted
by both sections, practically pronounced the
punishment deserved. But Bailey, so far
from being extinguished, was merely biding
his time. It was his influence which secured
the abandonment of the “Red” rules fathered
on the A.L.P. by Willis and Voigt, and he
was the dark, implacable figure behind the
expulsion of Seale from the A.L.P. presi-
dency by his colleagues on the executive.
It is a squalid squabble at best, with one
side sneering “Yah, Communism!” and the
other retorting, “Yah, sliding panels!”
The ridiculously large number of informal
votes at the Dailey Federal by-election was
due to the fact that many people objected to
both candidates and put weird remarks on
their ballot-papers so that they could claim
to have voted according to law. It would be
strictly logical, where going to the poll is
compulsory or even where it isn’t, if there
was a place on the ballot-paper for the nega-
tive vote —that of the person who objects to
both or all the candidates, and demands a
fresh poll with all of them excluded. The
disgruntled elector who disliked both Theo-
dore and Gee knew that one of them must
get in, no matter what hieroglyphics he put
on his ballot-paper. But the knowledge that
it was possible to shut both of them out of
the contest altogether, and to discredit both
parties at once, might have made that invis-
ible politician the Negative A'ote toil
mightily, and hold meetings at every street
corner, and shout himself hoarse.
Bill Denny, the S. Aus. Labor Attorney-
General, is disconcertingly frank. Writing
in the Adelaide Advertiser he points out
that the electoral laws of the State which
gave the world the Australian ballot are
“notoriously out of date,” as witness the
retention of the first-past-the-post system,
and “most extraordinary anomalies exist."
For example, “my own district of Adelaide,”
with 14,804 electors on October 31, has three
Assembly members, whereas suburban AVest
Torrens (30,075 electors) has only two. In
the country, Wooroora (11,022 electors) has
three members and Victoria (12,013) two.
“AVhile 174,000 electors in metropolitan and
suburban areas return only 15 members,
132,000 country electors return 31 members."
It is different in Victoria, where the Nat.-
Cockies rule:—
The Victorian system is not nearly so dispropor-
tionate as that in this State. The Vic. scheme
allots an average per member of 18,500 voters to
metropolitan and urban districts, and 10,000 to
country areas. In South Australia the disparity is
about 18,500 to 6500 electors.
A r ic. Labor-leader Hogan didn’t quote Denny
when he thundered against the Allancock
scheme at Ballan on Thursday night.
Three State elections are in view, and three
sets of men are busy explaining the wonders
they have done in “getting people on the
land.” The two earliest processes are to
find the land, very often by buying it with
loan money and shoving some previous
people and their industry off it, and next
to find the loan money for a non-paying
railway to the land. Then the Government
finds the people to go on the land, and
finds a market for their produce at the other
end of the world, where it isn’t really
much wanted, by humping it around below
cost at the charge of the taxpayer. After
that it finds that the business is, to a great
extent, a cruel and pig-headed fiasco, tin-
land being too poor or too dear or too in-
sufficient or too all three. Insane Ministries
have loaded Victoria with £31,000,000 of
debt for repurchase of land alone, and the
latest report is that the position is pretty
desperate all round. The prospect before
the average Gippsland settler, one estimate
has it, is that if he hangs on for 30 years
lie will be £6OOO in debt. And amid all
these mad doings the real need was for local
factories to make carpets and linoleum for
the local floor, and a lot of things like that.
ATc. Railway Commissioners’ estimate of
the extra cost to them of the 44-hour week
may be unduly optimistic. Previous awards
of the Arbitration Court resulted in a deficit
last year of £850,000, and Clapp and Co.
were authorised to get in another £600,000
by increasing their charges. If they have to
knock four hours off the working week, and
if they are right in saying it will cost
£600,000, they will still have to contend with
a deficit of £850.000. There are over 600
separate trades in the department, and
every one of these will want to apply for
44 hours, and their bosses will have to leave
their work to go and argue the point. So
there is a merry time ahead for all con-
cerned.

“The cashier of a Sydney firm was sentenced at
Darlinghurst sessions to five years for embezzlement.
The total defalcations were placed at i;39,000, all
of which had been lost on the racecourse. One of

O your voice was almost breaking and the tears were
near your eyes
When you spoke of hungry children underneath these
sunny skies, *
Half-fed youngsters, drifting schoolward, all too
clearly—hapless lads 1—
Progeny of insufficiently remunerated dads.
You were pledged their lot to lighten, even if it
meant a scrap
With the Council, and they cheered you for a philan-
thropic chap.
Thwarted over child endowment, still you’ve scope
for noble rage
In inducing “good ole Piddo” to increase the basic
wage.
Meanwhile, if you haven’t accomplished all the good
you meant to do,
There’s one class will sing your praises, and they’ve
booming voices, too.
It should compensate you for a lot of glum and
lowering looks,
The unstinted approbation of these worthy souls,
the books.
Other sorely needed measures and reforms perforce
must wait,
Premiers cannot take their fences like a bull would
charge a gate.
One must hasten slowly. Every- blow for freedom,
we’ll admit,
Brings the great millennium and Utopia nearer by
a bit.
Is it nought the honest toiler should in future have
threescore
Days for doing his hard-earned brass in that he
never had before?
Panem et circcnses was what Roman Caesars once
disbursed
To the clamant proletariat—why not put circemscs
first ?
Four and sixty' extra meetings—crowded courses,
straining nags,
Totes that promise thumping divvies, lure of bookies’
bursting bags !
Though de Chair stand firm as granite and the
Council scorns to yield,
Lang shall never lack for claqueurs in the tribe that
lays the field.
There are tribunes who discover, when their little
race is run,
Nobody can call to memory anything worth while
they’ve done.
i iff they creep into oblivion, flicker wanly off the
screen,
Leaving none to eulogise them or to keep their
memory green.
Men who deemed themselves Colossi find, or would
if they were here,
That their fame was writ in water or the thinnest
kind of beer.
But there’s one who, whatsoever he may have achieved
or not
1 n the higher realms of statecraft, won’t be readily
foi-got
Where the betting babel rises, where they howl to
Heaven the odds;
Surely he shall have a niche in the Valhalla of their
gods,
Surely gratitude for favors rendered evermore shall
glow
Towards his Labor benefactors in the breast of Ikey

New premises for the milk and butter
departments were completed early in the
term. They are equipped with plant which
is declared to be “the finest of its kind in
the world.” This installation was expected
to cut costs; to what extent the anticipation
was fulfilled isn’t visible from the accounts,
which give particulars neither of earnings
nor of expenditure. Competition in every
branch of the business continued keen, par-
ticularly in milk. Ice sales showed a sub-
stantial increase, and the ice-cream depart-
ment did heavier business; “other depart-
ments continue to expand and to show satis-
factory results.” Profits certainly were
£4906 greater, but the div. was promptly
lifted a point, which absorbed most of the
increase. Reserves benefited by £1687.
Although they look substantial, actually, at
£66,320, they are only £llOO more than they
were seven years ago; and capital in the
meantime has increased by more than

Bank overdraft increased from £1332 to
£24,514 and sundry creditors from £80,408
to £115,070. Property and plant are very
heavy items; a business of this kind demands
plenty of space in a central position. Unfor-
nately for the Fresh Food the export trade
in meat is still dull, and the capital tied up
in refrigerating plant, which in brisker years
was a source of good profits, is now a drag.
All things considered, the co. did well to
show improvement last year, for the margins
in milk and ice must be narrow. Neces-
sarily profits claimed by the accounts depend
on whether provision for wear and tear has
been adequate. Unspecified amounts are pro-
vided for depreciation, bad debts, etc., and.
with £368,692 in fixed assets and £68,776
in book debts the annual call must be fairly
loud.
Despite the improvement in profits, the
increase in dividend, the more optimistic tone
of the report, and the new plant, the market
is not impressed, and 18s. 104 d. represents
the best value on offer. The management
is confident. But competition in most lines
handled is more likely to increase in keen-
ness than to ease, and the frozen-meat
trade is very dull. If the management can
discover more profitable use for some
of its plant, the appearance of things may
be changed. At the moment the prospects
are that it will have to battle along on
narrow margins, and Labor legislation will
not make the task easier.

Consumers served by the North Shore Co.
received an emphatic reminder of the cost
of Labor legislation last year when they
found their gas accounts from June 1
raised from ss. sd. per thousand c. ft. to
6s. 3d. Application was made for an
ii: creased price and 6s. 3d. was granted by
Jnstice Campbell. Coal was dearer, and
increased wages and the institution of the
44-hour week and the new Workers’ Compen-
sation (the latter alone added £2OOO p.a.),
formed a combination that lifted costs
of production and distribution. Coal
and labor and coal prices are con-
trolled chiefly by labor costs —are the
factors which largely determine gas prices,
and that is made clear to metropolitan
residents whenever hours are clipped or wages
advanced. The rise in coal, for instance,
since April, 1925, when the co.’s present
contract was entered into, has amounted to
3s. 7d., and, on 75.000 tons p.a., that is a
considerable item. The quantity of gas sold
last year was less than in the preceding term
—the first time in the history of the co.
This was due largely to the demolition of
houses in the area resumed for Sydney har-
bor bridge. The increasing number of new
buildings being erected in the co.’s area
should, however, soon restore the difference.
Expenditure was heavier :

The falling-off in production of residuals is
a disappointing feature. Supply exceeded
demand. To create markets is sometimes an
expensive process, but increasing revenue
from residuals offers one way by which gas
cos. can build up so that they may face the
competition of electricity with confidence.
Expansion has been consistent; almost every
recent year has seen an increase in capital.
Last year paid capital went from £610,675
to £650,675, premiums benefiting by £7130.
A further 40,000 shares are to be auctioned
next month. The money will be used to
repay 74 p.c. debentures maturing up to
April next. The co.’s claim for compensa-
tion for the resumption of its old premises
was settled in August last. As the new
capital was earmarked for new services, the
compensation was doubtless used to reduce
the temporary loans and the bank overdraft.

The_ final div. increased the. excess to
£226,195. Fixed assets were in at £986,513
compared with £957,110 of the previous year.
In the case of N. S. Wales cos. operating
under the Gas Act investors are interested
chieny in the management. If this is effici-
ent then 8 p.c. may be looked upon almost as
a certain annual distribution. Whether elec-
tricity will be cheapened to such an extent as
to force down gas prices even at the expense
of divs. only the future will tell. The danger
is not visible and investors are content with
a return of 6f p.c. p.a. for wliat they believe
to be the assured nature of the investment.

* Two years.
As a rule, the co. has worked on narrow
margins from the time it was formed to
acquire the pastoral interests of the old
Q.M.E. Distributions were not lavish, but
when lean times came with the slump after
1920, the reserve strength was negligible and
shareholders had to do without. The three
years of losses—l92l-22-23 —used up what
little had been accumulated, and registered
a deficit of £B2lO, and although the slight
recovery of the next two years allowed of
divs. to pref. shareholders, last year’s loss
has resulted in a P. and L. debit of £24,921.
llealising the poor prospects for cattle, the
co. decided to convert portion of its exten-
sive holdings for sheep. The process called
for money; hence the appearance of the pref.
capital (£107,249 at November 30). Tar-
brax, purchased as a fattening depot for
cattle from the Gulf runs, was changed over
in 1923, and the 1924 clip was sold at record
prices. The co.'s interests, however, are
still predominantly cattle. Maxwelton was
in last year’s drought area, and Tar-
brax sheep had to be removed to agistment
country. That and the necessity of hand-
feeding hit the co. heavily. Other knocks
were the lessened sales of wool and stock,
and the fact that cattle from the Gulf sta-
tions could not be transferred to the bouth.
Wool offers the way out, and the difficul-
ties which always accompany dry spells and
the heavy cost of stocking—with wool at
high prices cheap sheep are only a f memory
—are incidental to the advantages which
conversion should bring. Balance-sheet
items might be clearer: —

Investments .. 8.500
Liabilities have been steadily reduced, but
some of the new capital has helped there.
The amount of bank overdraft might be
stated. Freeholds, leaseholds, plant, live-
stock and wool are thrown together in an
untidy entry of £383,919, yet stores, book
debts and cash which amount to only a few
thousands are stated separately. Additional
prefs. amounting to £4883 were taken up
during the term, bringing paid capital to
£325,579—£107,249 in 8 p.c. prefs. and
£215,330 in ords. A record profit Will have
to be earned this year if prefs. are to receive
something. The I*. and L. debit amounts to
£24,921, and with the accrued divs. prefs.
will be owed £17,000-odd. Ordinaries will
have to wait, although favorable seasons and
high wool prices can work wonders. Net
tangibles at the balancing date amounted to
almost £3 per pref. share, but the value is
dependent on whether sufficient has been
set aside for amortisation and wear arid tear,
and whether the cattle have been valued in
the light of existing' world conditions. The
cattle position is too unfavorable to make
the scrip attractive, but there are possibili-
ties in the sheep. Since the close of the
accounts good rains have fallen on the co.’s
stations, and all stock have improved in
condition. It’s a good start' for the current
year. # # e

Increasing demand has kept the co. busy for
the past 10 years, and the process of plant
installation and main-laying lias not eased up
yet. Last year, for instance, a second unit
of the vertical retort plant was erected; a
new gasholder was completed; substantial
additions and alterations were made to the
co.’s office premises ; nine miles of new mains
were laid; and records were broken in the
matter of sales. Nor is the end of the expan-
sion in sight. A trunk main from Miramar
to Kilbirnie is under way, and that will eat
up considerable capital, while extensive
reticulation has been held up owing to the
English coal strike interfering with pipe sup-
plies. As the co. will not get a substantial
return on recent outlay for some years the
directors “deemed it prudent to provide for
it to some considerable extent out of pro-
fits.” That is sound policy which should
benefit shareholders later on. In fact, it was
definitely stated at the annual meeting that,
on completion of the works now in hand, the
directors looked forward to being able to
benefit consumers and shareholders alike. The
co. keeps a paternal eye on its consumers;
in the past four years gas has been reduced
by Is. sd. per thousand c. ft.,- and despite
increases in coal prices last year of Bs. 7d.
per ton (equal to £4OOO p.a.) the burden was
borne by the co.
Capital was unchanged at £303.370, but
tlie ordinary shares, previously £lO, were
divided into £1 shares, which should increase
their popularity with investors. The balance
of capital consists of 84,560 £1 5 p.c. prefs.—
a nice parcel of cheap money. The co.
effected a fine saving last year: mortgage
debenture stock amounting to £200,000. and
carrying 8 p.c., was renewed as from October
1 at p.c. with the exception of £16,050,

Liquids were drawn on to finance the impres-
sive programme of expansion. The co. is
assisted by the solid reserves and the cheap
pref. capital, and will benefit this term by
the decreased debenture rate. Prospects of
a lift in the div. are bright. Of course
dependence on the Maitland miners isn’t a
good factor, but they recently refused to
strike, -and that is a hopeful sign. The scrip
is popular; 265. 6d. represents a recent
middle quote.

While the profit won in 1925 was good, last
year’s was an achievement, for the difficulties
of the earlier term were present in an
exaggerated form throughout 1926. Meat
exporters in Maoriland have been telling
doleful tales of poor markets and strong
competition, and even high-class mutton has
not escaped the unfavorable experience.
Shareholders got their fourth consecutive
10 p.c.—it is worth nearer 20 p.c. to most of
them, owing to the 1919 capitalisation—
and the substantial reserves were not
neglected. Those reserves are worth a second
glance: after the final div. had been paid
they amounted to £15,271 more than paid
capital. And, of course, they help to make a
10 p.c. div. a simple matter. Shareholders
have been rewarded for their early abstin-
ence, and even the verra consairrvative
boarrd will have to do something with the
increasing accumulation sooner or later.

Sundry creditors and contingent liabilities
are lumped together at £50,209, and a bit of
fat may be stored in that lot. However,
deducting that amount and the final div.,
there was £127,440 more or less liquid to
represent the 20.160 £1 prefs. and the
109,890 ords. (45,006 paid to 10s.). And
the freeholds, buildings and plant were in
at a conservative £120,603. Prefs. are in a
very strong position, and ords. nicely situ-
ated. The experience of the past two years
suggests that Southland will have a rich time
when the trade gets back to normal. That
happy time isn’t in sight at the moment.

By entering the field of electricity the co.
hopes to make what might be termed a new-
start in life. The market certainly is im-
pressed. Twelve months ago the scrip could
be picked up at under 14s. Recently sellers
were asking par, and latest sales were at
17s. 9d. The accounts do not confirm the
improved opinion. In the first place, profits
were only a couple of hundred greater than
for 1925. and one has to go back to the
’nineties to find smaller returns. Also, the
co. has entered a field in which competition
is very keen. Despite long experience and
(over a period) virtual monopoly, the lift
subsidiaries of the English Electric have
to fight for their business.. In, any case, as
matters stand, the co.’s interests are still
overwhelmingly hydraulic, and that form of
power has been shouldered aside by electri-
city, particularly in passenger lifts. Gross
revenue last year was greater, but practi-
cally the whole of the increase was mopped
up by increased expenditure:—

Such an increase in outgo does not inspire
confidence. In 1915, with little more than
half the revenue, a net profit greater than
that of last term was shown. Renewals and
repairs arc doubtless a heavy item, but the
exact position is not visible, all exes, being
lumped in the one entry in P. and L. Better
control of expenditure is necessary if the
co. is to do anything to justify the im-
proved opinion. Reserves seem substantial;
they amount to £67,938, less goodwill item
of £15,000. With the exception of a few
thousands, however, the. whole of capital
and reserves is invested in the business, but


THE BENEFITS OF LONG EXPERIENCE
Wide experience is quite as important a factor in efficient Estate administration as the
integrity of the trustee or executor you appoint.
Too often the appointment of an individual trustee, with little or no experience in
intricate trust matters, has involved unnecessary trouble and expense. This burden need
not be yours.
The Permanent Trustee Company
of N.S.W., LTD.,
TRUSTEES - EXECUTORS - ATTORNEYS - AGENTS,
has Estates under control exceeding £11,000,000.
After 39 years’ service the Company possesses a wealth of experience rarely acquired
by an individual.
Security is afforded you by its special Act of Parliament, which renders the whole of
the Capital and Assets, over one million pounds, available for the protection of your
interests.
A special feature of this service is the Company’s practice of charging its Corpus
Commission at the end, and not at the commencement, of a trust.

Water syslems that are to be permanent require
in their construction materials of undoubted dura-
bility and efficiency. Pioneer Wood Pipe is practi-
cally indestructible, as it cannot rust, corrode not
become choked with fungus, etc. It actually in-
creases in efficiency when in constant use, ensures
water purity, and costs practically nothing to main-
tain. For further particulars apply to the Aus-

Fifty thousand “or more” is the blister
to be attached to Amalgamated Zinc to test
chemist Avery’s eucalyptus newsprint ambi-
tions. While W. L. Baillieu was cool and
Monty Cohen hostile, Avery padded the hoof
through the island State, having full
permission of the Zinc board to break bounds.
He finished up at the Geeveston end of the
Huon, where he now holds a 99-year con-
cession to work 500 square miles of timber
on a liberal arrangement with the Speck
Parliament. Having lassoed this block of
the earth with sundry rights, concessions
and promises of electric power, Avery re-
enters the fold with something which “W.L.”
and “Monty” agree will give scope for
experimenting on a commercial scale with a
pulping plant that caught someone’s eye
at Wembley. Points for the gamble are
that the co. doesn’t need to buy out free-
holders, as with G. Musson’s original Van
Diemen’s Land Co. project; timber is
there for the cutting for 99 years
at a peppercorn figure; and deep-water facili-
ties exist. Next, since Avery went to Holland
to experiment as to using hardwood for pulp,
science has so progressed that Baillieu can
now sponsor this investigational campaign,
even though he previously had decided that
lie had ended big-job pioneering with Elec-
trolytic Zinc. As Avery became a freelance
when he found the board-room frigid over the
north-west Tassy plan, Amalgamated Zinc
comes into the Huon scheme on a 60 p.c.
footing in a subsidiary co. The other 40
p.c. goes to selected people—English, pro-
bably—with a proper recompense for Avery
should the bud blossom. Broker Laidlaw
came over from Adelaide to preach that
everything industrial was going to the dogs
because Labor is canny, because hours are
44, and because spendthrifts are everywhere.
Baillieu boomed him down with cheery opti-
mism and won votes by citing Electrolytic
Zinc’s success as initiated upon similar lines.
Thus the old hands are in the field once
more. The job admittedly will need from
£1,509,000 to £2,000,000 to get decently
going.

“O.B.” (W.A.) : Desperate attempts are
being made in London to sell shares in Star
Mining Syndicate. Recent reports declare
(hat the output of emeralds from the co.’s
show at Poonah produced 4000 carats, that
stones were cutting finely, that monthly ship-
ments of 1000 carats were assured, and that
many accounts of the great wealth exposed
had reached Australia House. On the
strength of these and other glowing state-
ments shares paid to ss. appreciated to 18s.
Star’s nominal capital is £60,000 in 240,000
ss. shares; the vendor has been made a
present of half of this number, and a con-
cern known as the Tokenhouse Securities
Corporation has been given two years’ option
on 80,000 at par in consideration of having
placed 40,000 at par. Emeralds have been
known to exist at Poonah for many years.
In 1914 a Hatton Garden gem merchant,
after cutting some stones with disappoint-
ing results, expressed the opinion that it
was “wmrtli trying further to obtain better
material.” Since then the field has been
visited by one or two representatives of over-
seas gem dealers with no remarkable results.

Tributors are tackling Gt. Boulder (W.A.)
in good style, Over two-thirds of last month’s
output of £3.3,336 from the property came
from their comparatively small area, and
further good returns arc anticipated. After
what happened at the Perseverance and what
is now taking place at the Boulder, the feel-
ing is growing locally that tributors and not
amalgamations would be Kalgoorlie’s and
Boulder’s salvation.
* * * *
Monte Carlo Bank Co. (W.A.) has shifted
again. On the strength of a bag or two of
■specimens—the last remains of a rich patch
—it had a short flutter in a Cue show, and
then gave up. Later it removed to Field’s
Find, where thousands of ounces of ounce
ore were stated to await extraction in the
water-logged workings of an old mine. This
intelligence didn’t revive a down-and-out
market and prevent disappointed sharehold-
ers from forfeiting their scrip. The co.
recently took an option on a lease at Glenelg
Hills, which is stated to have several good
gold-bearing things within its boundaries,
but. remembering past reports, the market
is dubious.
* * * *
North White Feather (W.A.) announces
that its proposed reconstruction has been
obviated by some generously-disposed persons
taking up a fairly large wad of shares under
the control of the old co.’s liquidator. The
co. is lucky to have such optimists among
its friends.
* * * *
A tin-mining syndicate has been formed in
Adelaide to give the Moolyella deposits on
the Pilbara field (W.A.) another trial. Allu-
vialists did well on this field for a time, but
had to get out on account of a falling off in
returns. One or two battlers remained, and
are earning a living.

\ party of working miners recently struck
a quantity of highly payable ore in the lower
levels of the old Mararoa mine at Norseman
(W.A.), and it is expected this will repay the
±‘lo,ooo they invested in the mine and plant
last year. Adjoining the old Mararoa is che
New Mararoa, owned by Matthiessen
brothers. Here, at the 200 ft. level, and
1700 ft. from the old Mararoa boundary,
30dwt. ore is exposed, and as all the merit
of the old Mararoa was contained under its
300 ft. level, the prospects of the New Mara-
roa below that depth are encouraging enough
to go on with.

Fresh discoveries continue to be made on
the new field at Hollow’s Find, Glenelg
Hills (W.A.), but, up to the present, the
fact that there is so much ore associated
with the gold has been the main point of
weakness. Gold has been located at Hollow’s,
Smith’s, Glenelg Queen, Queen Deeps, Glen-
elg King, Le Feuvre’s, Coventry’s, Great
Beacon and others. Prospectors of the right
type have been attracted to the field, and
investors are willing to venture provided they
see a decent chance. The field has been
named after Joe Hollow, who, for three
years, had a strenuous time on it prior to
the present activity.

Federation Tin, N.L., South Heemskirk
(Tas.), was bought last year by a London
co. for 90,000 shares and ±35,000 cash.
Shares were issued to yield ±102,820 cash, and
this is how some of it has melted away:
Preliminary expenses, ±7500; underwriting
and over-riding commissions, ±6600; broker-
age, ±1057; total, ±15,157. Office and
general expenses, ±367; mining outlay,
±2268. A tiny piece of bread for a large-
sized cup of sack!

A fact elicited at the Mt. Bischoff meeting
was that chairman Hart had been asked by
some outside group for an option over the
shares of the co. Those wanting the option
laid it down that their names were not to
be disclosed. Such a stipulation should have
met with the reply that there was
nothing doing. However, Hart told the
board, under a promise of secrecy, and they
cold-shouldered the option. The future pro-
gramme for the mine is not only to clean
up Mt. Bischoff and the North Valley allu-
vial, but to retain a nest-egg of ±lO,OOO for
investment in any decent show that may
come along.

Two gold-producers lacking a reserve fund
have each borrowed ±2OOO from the Vic.
Mines Department. New Red, White and Blue.
Bendigo, crushed 6015 tons for 22220 z. of
gold, an average or. over 7dwt. Morning Star,
Woods Point, crushed 738 tons for 7250 z.,
including tributors’ yields. The co. owes
±6457 to the Government. There seems to
be something wrong about this policy. Both
cos. are owned by substantial investors and
managed by experienced directors, yet they
divide every penny they earn, and when dead
work is necessary they run to the Govern-
ment for help. A ten-line amendment of the
No Liability Act would compel every mining
co. to create reserve funds from profits.
* * * *
With tin at ±3OO the old Mitta Mitta field
is to have another trial. Its history was
sickening for the investor. The Scrubby
Creek patch taken up by a Melbourne crowd
is a relic watched ever since then as a mining
possibility. After months of prospecting and
encouragement from mining-engineer S. N.
Rodda, the State has let geologist Barag-
wanath check up work. On the whole he
confirms the width of the tin-bearing forma-
tions. They are porphyritic dykes running
up to 50ft. in width. The best of the tin is
connected with runs of gneisen, and is in the
form of coarse oxide crystals. Some of the
reports label metal contents as going up to
30 p.c. tin. Baragwanath admits from a
trace up to 15 p.c. Already room exists for
gougevs. What has to be proven is that the
shoots of tin live down at the Mitta better
than they have done anywhere else in the
wide extent of Australia and Tas.
Rose, Thistle and Shamrock has good
yields, 3295 tons in a six months’ run giving
32570 z. All the stone comes from the Sham-
rock reef, which runs about 4ft. wide and
is worked at the 380- and 480-feet levels.
But the shoot is short, and the race was to
get the new lift open at 570 feet. Now it
is driven on for 50ft., the underlie shaft is to
be rushed down to another level. Ore
reserves are about 3500 tons, or a half-year’s
work. The job ahead is once again to
prospect that old div.-payer, the Land Tax
reef. It not long since put ±12,000 of
profits into the till and paid for developing
tne Shamrock formation, and so deserves
attention. # ,
B. H. Southern Lode in Pitt-street hardly
echoes the optimism of chairman D. K. tiigiis
at the general meeting, ihe share market
flatness, declared Inglis, may he attributed
to the fact that “the general public has not
yet realised the immense chances of the co.,
whose geographical position makes it natu-
rally part and parcel of the continuation ot
the great B.H. lode.” Bill Biechers,-the| ven-
dor, corroborated, and believed that blocks 38
and 79 would so supply the null as to make
the property self-supporting in six months
time. A plan issued by the board shows
that “the co.’s leases extend from Block 08
to the Barrier South, a distance of miles.

Commonwealth Malaya Tin has taken
an option over 2560 acres at Bynoe Harbor,
near Port Darwin, N.T. Scout boring has
disclosed 14oz. ground, and extended bonng
is to be done by T. I. Dyson. The area
adjoins Plang Gong's alluvial property which
was worked for good returns by open sluicing
some years ago.
* *
New Guinea Gold and Osmiridium Co.
hasn’t yet produced either metal, but reports
another crop of pegged leases. Nos. 1 and -
Golden Chance leases, of 240 acres each,
adjoining Guinea Gold Co.’s property, have
been secured; also No. 3 Golden Chance, of
240 acres at the head of Wau Creek, Lulo-
lo ” H W. Clark, the original prospector
and vendor of the co.’s first crop of leases at
Edie Creek, trots off to London with a float
in view; and J. L. Gordon, a London M.
“will also leave for New Guinea this month
to commence mining operations on the co. s
properties.” » * *
Guinea Gold is developing its field policy
sufficiently well to win applause from I rank
Anstey, M.H.R., who noted ‘the sawmill,
huts and dwellings, large labor corps and
many acres of ration crops for the boys.
Chairman Wells states that a consolidated
lease of 220 acres is the hope on which
preliminary production is proceeding, and
isolated tests give 565. a yard, but “we cannot
of course assume that this is any guide to
average value until exhaustive sampling has
been completed.” The sluicing plant should
be capable of dealing with 10,000 to 12,000
yards a month.” The latest Adelaide bulle-
tin states that, in addition to the 400 oz.
of gold received early in February, 2o addi-
tional specimens of gold-bearing stone were
received and submitted to E. B. Jensen for
examination. He reported that they were
very rich, some of them practically nuggets,
average bullion content being 59 p.c. They
were all water-worn.”
* * * *
Austral Asiatic Tin, of which Joseph Tom-
linson, of Sydney, is chairman, lias received
a further progress report of boring on its
Tarua property. The co.’s representative,
A C. S. McLeod, reports that close boring
has proved another 40 acres, averaging 13*ft.
in depth and 1240 z. in value. This practi-
cally confirms the January preliminary bor-
ing tests. Tarua’s original lease covered only
120 acres, which, with the shallow ground,
promised a dredging life of only five years or
so. The extra area is being further bored,
as well as a prospecting license adjoining the
Tarua lease, of some 400 acres. Muang
Tuat, the 300-acre group of leases also taken
up by the co.. is now being bored. Scout-
ing lias showed an average of 21oz. to the
cubic yard throughout the property—-m the
January report some holes were marked as
returning 320 z. Depths are better on this
area, going down to 26ft., which, of course,
means a much bigger turnover than can be
stripped from Tarua’s shallow ground.

From a man on the spot:—
Many areas in Malaya recently reported on are
very doubtful. “Mining Engineer’s” remarks on Malim
Nawar, Kundang and Selayang are justified. I consider
the Tanjong Toll Allang, Kinta Valley, where five
new companies are preparing dredges, as doubtful
ground; the depth ranges to 80ft., and values are
light. I have done some boring there. In Siam
we have Tin Songala, Kopah and Eastern Siam, which
have to justify a high market opinion. The public
should be sure that it has obtained reliable infor-
mation as to values and area before investing in
new tin shows. The prospecting is the main thing;
if that is not correct other claims and statements
in the prospectus are of little value. To be a
freelance prospector at the present time in this
countrv and find employment, one must be prepared
to report to orders. Many prospectors now working
on areas have never seen a bore put down and do
not know the country or the language. It takes a
long time for dredges to start operations and in
some cases the space of time may depend on how ti e
promoters have managed to get rid of theii holdings.
To be at work in July or August
next on Tongkah Compound’s, block at
Sotul No. I new dredge; to start
in October, No. 2 plant. The first
is Australian made, the second English;
£6O 000 has been paid on account of the two
plants, of which £40,000 is the wad to Aus-
tralia. The sum of £17,890 has still to be
found to cover the cost of the plants, plus
£f500() for the transport and erection of the
English unit. To meet the full debt £B6OO
is available from cash and calls, £2500 for
the sale of parts of the suction dredge, and
divs. of £4069 from the co.’s No. 2 Tongkah
Harbor pup. With tin at the present level,
and the pup contributing over £9OOO profits
a year, Compound finance is a lot more com-
fortable than Premier Lang’s, so calls should
not worry. The co. holds 40,687 shares m
its pup, which stand in the books at £24,965
to represent the valuation of the dredge it
supplied. That the swap for shares was
good for the Compound is shown by the divs.
it has already received. The show lias a
good life ahead in fair ground, and so is going
to contribute a lot more money in the days
to come. The suction-cutter plant soon will
be a memory. A market exists for the parts
of the plant, and so the last of the old debit
in the books of £BOOO against that fateful
experiment will disappear this year.

Yet another ’plane for the New Guinea
goldfields. This belongs to the Bulolo Aero-
plane Service, and was flown from Mel-
bourne to Sydney by Roy Parer, who, with
Mclntosh, made the most daring flight yet
accomplished from England to Australia in a
crazy second-hand ’plane. Parer will accom-
pany the De Ilaviland to Salamoa and fly
her for the co., which is a transport con-
cern only. Carrying 7501 b. of cargo, the
machine is expected to make three trips a day
between Salamoa and the Bulolo Valley.

SHE NEEDED A CONVEYANCE BADLY.
GUSHING VISITOR: “Oh, I do so dote on Tennyson's poems; they carry me away.”
LADY OF THE HOUSE ( feelingly ): “Oh, I am so sorry we haven't a volume in the house."
“Lao-dah” : This one seems new. A well-
dressed man strolled into the lounge of a
Collins-street hostelry and ordered a whisky
and soda, handing the boy a note. The boy
brought back change from a pound, where-
upon the stranger declared that it should be
from £2O. To the manager, hurriedly called,
he repeated his claim, even supplying the
number of the note, which he stated he had
drawn out of the bank that morning. Going
to the cash-register the manager indeed found
such a note inside, and, reprimanding the boy,
apologetically pressed £2O, less the price of
the drink, upon the now mollified gent.
When the head barman, who had been off
duty, returned, he was able to recollect quite
promptly that a person, answering to the
description given him, had come in earlier
and secured change for the £2O note.^
“B Flat”: The artistic temperament has
had its latest expression in Mackay (N.Q.),
which escaped the recent cyclone only to be
smitten with a band contest. A Maryborough
band cleaned up the show, and when it was
departing, laden Avith cups and money, a
second Maryborough band, which had finished
down the course, lined up and played the
Dead March. Even in N.Q. they won’t stop a
train for a free fight unless some important
politico-industrial principle is involved, so
the last chapter won’t be written till the
second band gets back to Maryborough,
whither police reinforcements are, presum-
ably, being rushed.

“Sparking Plug”: Talking of incendiaries
(B. 24/2/’27). a friend of mine tells this
yarn. “Rounding a sharp bend on a lonely
bush track in South Aus. I came suddenly
upon a smouldering Lizzie, with ,another car
pulled up some few yards away. In the
space between the cars two hefty men were
having a ding-dong scrap. As I pulled up
one of the combatants floored the other with
a straight left to the point, and immediately
beat it through the dense scrub. I helped
the prostrate one to his feet, when he back-
fired to some purpose. ‘The cow,’ he
groaned. ‘I came across him standing help-
lessly by, Avliile his ’bus Avcnt up in smoke.
I grabbed my fire-extinguisher and rushed in.
And what did he say? Told me to git to hell
out of it Avith my damned contrivances, and
asked Avhose flamin’ car was it anyway? And
then he started in on me.’ ”
“Stcllsby”: “Cro” (B. 24/2/’27) con-
fesses to having had a week's leave stopped
for crossing the quarter-deck in a Tiffy’s
overalls while the flagship Avas alongside. My
offence Avas worse. I came over the side of
the flagship in Singapore eroAvned Avith a
soldier’s khaki helmet Avhich, unknown to
me. had been substituted for my “fore and

Avas “crimed” for burlesquing his Britannic

covered by sea-going time.

“Centurion” : There are some curious feat-
ures in the case of four Sydney girls con-
cerning whom “Colonial” Secretary Lazza-
rini laid a report “for members only” on the
table of the Leg. Assembly. This informed
members— avlio were begged not to disclose
the young ladies’ names—that the quartette
had spent some days, clad in male attire, on
the. German barque Lispeth. anchored at
Goat Island, Avith the vessel’s creAV. The
girls Avere charged with vagrancy, but their
relatives; gave them good characters and
stated that the affair was “only a- girlish
prank.” The euphemistic phrase recalls the
robber’s daughter in the “Bab Ballads” who
told her father confessor of her week’s sins,
which included two murders, forgery, pocket-
picking and a burglary:—
“Pooh, pooh,” said Father Paul, “you’re young
and flighty in your mind.
Old heads; upon young shoulders we must not
expect to find.
AVe mustn’t be too hard upon these little girlish
tricks ;
Let’s see—five sins at half a crown —exactly
twelve and six.”
But in this case there wasn’t as much as a
half-crown penalty.
“Harold Hardupp” : As an emblem of luck
the horseshoe has its limitations. The 71-year-
old John Vaubell, of Coff’s Harbor (N.S.W.).
was shooing a stray horse out of a yard
when the animal sportively kicked out its
hind legs. A loose shoe detached itself from
the back-flung hoof, and flew into Vaubell’s

Wearying of the tame pastime of dropping

prising Melbourne
youngsters fetched
a metal motor-
wlieel-rim and low-
ered it on to Mr.
.Clapp’s overhead
electrio-train wires.
The resultant roar
and pillar of flame
awakened the coun-
tryside ; a station-
master just saved
the passengers in
an approaching
train from being
electrocuted by
stopping it; an-
other train had to
be diverted and its
occupants trans-
ferred, and the
breakdown gang
was sent for. Lay-
ing the contents of
a box of wax
matches on the
rails of the old
horse-tram in Adel-

me a feeble bit of
dare-devilry.

“Cobba”: I offer
no opinion about
the possibility of
an overboarded
mariner clinging to

when the training
schooner Ina John-
son was bowling
along under a
freshening breeze,
Bill Guy fell over
the stern. Nobody
saw his exit, and
his absence was
not suspected until
one of the native
crew noticed the
antics of the large
line trailing for
kingfish. A pull on
the line, and the
agonised shouts of
Bill revealed the
nature of the fish.
He w r as got aboard,
half-drowned, with
the large hook
securely embedded
in the fleshy part
of his thigh. Sam-
arai was made two days later, and the
hospital doctor inserted 17 ' stitches where
the hook had torn a lane in the flesh before

“A.H.A.”: The Prince of Wales followed
the Duke of Edinburgh’s example (B.
3/3./’27) in descending that Bendigo mine.
Down below H.R.H., in dungarees, was given
a pick and told to knock the gold off tile
roof. He was warned that the fragments
of rock brought down by his efforts were
very sharp; but in his enthusiasm he forgot
the caution and cut his finger badly. He had
no hanky in his mining garb, and I handed
ljim a clean one to bind the wound. Though
I reminded him at the time that he owed
me one of his hankies, and he promised to
replace it, he forgot about it. On my return
to the top, one of the mine officials gleefully
showed me a curious souvenir. He had care-
fully collected the fragments of rock upon
which the royal blood had spattered. The
blood wasn’t blue.

“81/5/1010” : Traversing my statement
that the High Seas Fleet didn’t influence the
war before Jutland, “John Cow” (B. 3/3/’27)
declares that it exerted an iron pressure on
Russia with disastrous consequences to that
country and the Allies. But the latter did
not look to Russia for any naval assistance,,
and influences quite apart from the German
fleet were responsible for the Russian
revolution. Again, Germany’s fleet did not
hold a long coastline; the latter held itself,
because from Dunkirk to Esjberg and
further the coast is practically unapproach-
able except at one or two spots. And the
“devastating submarine campaign” was
instituted just because the High Seas Fleet
had, as I said, failed to affect the course of
the w T ar.
“Tasiriki”: “Beche-de-mer” English, the
“lingua franca” of most of the Pacific, is a
very limited though useful language. I
heard a Frenchman who had just returned
from a trip to Sydney employing it as a
medium of remonstrance towards a friend
with whom relations were evidently
strained: “What name you! You thief, yon
rogue, you laze too much. You lie, too, you
no savvy tell him straight something along
belly belonga you, you piccaninny belong
pig. You no good, no good; you, what name
NOTHING EXCLUSIVE ABOUT IT.
“What I like about this jazz stuff is—you don’t need: to know how
to do it.”
you tell’m this fella, oui, oui, you allee sam ■
one Sydney larrikin.” This last must have
eased his feelings somewhat, for they were
soon patching up peace over a glass of
absinthe.

“Harold Hardupp” : An exceptionally good
friend of the bookmakers has bad to face
the penalty of over a decade of embezzling;
his employers stated that their money had
been disappearing at the rate of £4OOO p.a.,
and for nearly 10 years the trusted official’s
falsification of books had beaten the auditors
up till recently. A parson and some
extremely reputable citizens testified that the
embezzler was a quiet, steady sort of man
who lived frugally; so, apparently, as he
claimed in pleading guilty, bookies got
all his employer’s missing cash and a good
slice of his salary as well. The racing obses-
sion takes a wonderful grip upon some
people. I have in mind a highly-salaried
civil servant who lives in the cheapest of
boarding-houses, is invariably shabbily
dressed, and would scorn to let any of his
money drip across a bar; in fact, he hates
to spend a sixpence except upon racing bets.
That extravagance keeps him frugal in every
other direction.

“Chancery Lane”: One can understand
. absent-minded beggars leaving comparatively
small sums in savings banks and not claim-
ing them for years, but it is more difficult to
figure hard-headed business men deposit-
ing four-figure amounts in safe deposits
berore the war and leaving them there to be
discovered after their deaths. Yet last year
the Melbourne executors of two different
estates discovered that this had happened;
in one instance the amount was nearly
£l5OO. And there it had lain for over 12
years, producing nothing.
THE DEVIL AND THE DINGO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the Methodist Conference in Sydney one
speaker, appealing- for more missionary workers in
the bush, declared that the Devil was playing as
much havoc as the dingo in the southern and west-
ern districts of N. S. AVales.”
0, the dingo is the Devil, not the shadow of a doubt,
To the chaps whose jumbucks pasture on the stations
Further Out.
And the Devil is a dingo, deadliest of the ravening
pack,
To the spiritual shepherds of the human flocks Out
Back.
Creeping furtive on his victims, soon in carnage red
to revel,
Cams dingo’s execrated for a wanton, murderous
devil;
And malignant Satan, luring souls from grace with
grog and stingo.
Lights o’ love and cards and such-like, is a stinking,
slinking dingo.
See the Fiend in canine semblance, jaws' a-slaver,
ears a-cock,
’Neath the shades of night descending on the doomed
and quaking flock.
Now and then a shot may stop him, now and then
a trap may click,
But there’s no such danger waiting for the theolo-
gians’ Nick.
“Roaring lion,” Peter calls him in his apostolic
lingo—
Palestine among its fauna clearly didn’t rank the
dingo.
Not with leonine directness does Apollyon stalk
his prey,
But with stealthy craft, as ever, ’tother side of
Bourke and Hay.
Parsons rate the Prince of Darkness, while the
plethoric squatter’s curse
Rests upon the four-legged prowler—-and I know not
which is worse.
Still conditions of existence hardly seem upon the
level
Where the Devil plays the dingo and the dingo plays
the devil.

T. THE R.


“Ake”: I knew a Maoriland youth who
was rejected nine times at various recruiting-
depots—a blood-clot, the aftermath of typhoid,
was the trouble. At the tenth try he was
successful, and managed to get as far as
Egypt, only to be sent home after a sand-
march had aggravated his case. After a
six-months’ rest he re-enlisted again under
an assumed name, and after a year in France
he was sent home with an in-
jured hand. Then the bother
began the M.L. authorities
coldly ignored his existence
under the assumed name, and
brought documentary evidence
to prove he had been returned
from Egypt and discharged two
years earlier. It was a year
before they recognised his claim,
but the payment of back pen-
sion in a lump sum helped to
console him.
* * *
“Alexander”: There were
some fine instances of heroism
and self-sacrifice during the
recent disastrous floods in North
Queensland. Leaving the body
of his dead gin in the fork of a
tree, where she had succumbed
to- exhaustion and exposure
during the night, Murray, a
Cardwell aboriginal, battled
through the flood waters to the
railway pumping station. There
he heard of the plight of
a family marooned on the roof
of their dwelling at Saltwater
Creek. Despite his all-night
exposure, the plucky native
fought his way along the rail-
way line, through a wide ex-
panse of raging waters, to the
Kennedy telegraph station. A
message was got through to the
poliee at Cardwell, who organ-
ised a boating party and suc-
ceeded in rescuing the family
from their perilous plight.
* * *
“Allocatur”: It was at a
Yorke Peninsula (S.A.) ham-
let, and three well-known resi-
dents were being prosecuted for
shooting ’roos in the close sea-
son. The court was crowded
with townsfolk, the audience
including several women. Two
cockies occupied the bench, the
senior being an ex-schoolteacher
who still preserves his reputa-
tion for scholarship as chair-
man of the local literary society.
The evidence concluded, the
beaks retired to consider their
decision; on their returning,
the pedagogue-cocky J.P.. polite-
ly rising from his chair, addressed
the audience in general: “Ladies
and gentlemen,” he announced,
“we find the prisoners guilty !”
Then he turned to the defend-
ing counsel with the aside, “And
now what do we do?”
* * #
“Leamington”: If. the autho-
rities adhere to their decision
to take 50ft. from the site of
the Victoria Barracks, Padding-
ton (N.S.W.), to widen Oxford-
street, the famous old guard-
room, situated just inside the
main entrance, will disappear.
Some of the most famous
“busts” that Sydney has known
have finished beneath the low
roof of the old clink. A fam-
ous story of the guard-room
concerns Lord Carrington. Ilis
Ex., after repeated complaints
that he had been ignored by the
sentries on visiting the Bar-
racks, hit on the idea of pre-
senting the guard-room with
a painting of himself, so that
there should be no excuse for
failure to recognise him. But
the guardsmen merely stared
blankly at him on his next visit,
and he went straight to the com-
manding-officer with some cut
ting remarks about lack of dis-
cipline. Then it was dis
covered that the painting had
disappeared. Great was tin'
hubbub, but a young corporal
eventually confessed that he
had popped the likeness, and it
was later recovered from a local
pawnshop. The offender served
a stiff term in the cells; later in
life he was destined to rise to
high rank in the Fijian police.
“Stellsby”: The shortage of nurses in
Melbourne is not confined to the public and
private hospitals. Caulfield Military Hos-
pital has, during the past 12 months, been
forced to break through red tape and employ
sisters who have not seen war service. The
war sisters are not getting any younger and
many have forsaken the profession for some-
thing that promises better returns. One
Angel of my acquaintance has opened a
facsimile of ' the famous “No. 9 Darling-
street,” and is making good in an eastern
suburb as a professional hostess for wealthy
flattites who are unable to entertain in their
own abbreviated homes.
* * * *
“Black Tracker”: Not long ago the Chi-
nese cook employed at a country hotel in
South Aus. fell in love with the kitclienmaid,
a giddy young flapper. The affair was
regarded as a huge joke, and, at the sugges-
tion of a humorous barman, the girl was
induced to allow, or encourage, the slant-
eyed swain to declare his passion. After a
bit John was “accepted,” whereupon he made
his intended costly presents and bought
an expensive rig-out for himself. A mock
marriage, with the barman as parson, was
celebrated in due course, followed by a sup-
per. Then the “bride” disappeared to her
quarters, thinking the joke finished. But the
"bridegroom” had other ideas, and when he
shook hands with the guests with the remark
“I mustn’t keep the missus waiting,” and
started for the maids’ quarters, all reckoned
it was time for him to be disillusioned.
Five minutes later a yelling Chinaman
was flourishing an axe and vowing vengeance
on all and sundry. After he had been dis-
armed and handed over to the police, the
manager dismissed the whole staff.
“X.N.0.”: Naval tactics of old probably
owe much to John Clerk, of Elden, but the
debt is to a critic and analyst rather than to
the originator of a new system, as “Dry
Land” (B. 24/2/’27) seems to suggest. Clerk
in effect only drew* attention to the tactics
successfully adopted in the Franco-Dutch
battle of Stromboli in 1679. Rodney’s use
“An old lady struggling to fold her
newspaper in the wind! Pardon me,
.Madam,
“A job like this is one at which the
gentler sex does not shine.
“All that is required, however, is a

“Though, mind you, one must have

rogative of the sterner sex.

Madam—it’s quite simple when one

of the same “breaking the line” idea at the
Battle of the Saints was an impulse of the
moment suggested by a sudden change of
wind. As for Suffren utilising John Clerk’s
idea, Mahan distinctly states that there was
nothing to indicate any intention on his
side to depart from the usual ship-for-ship
fighting.
* * * *
“Flagwagger”: During a visit to Mil-
dura three years ago I strolled along the
Murray River bank and came to “Pinky”
Bend. A man whom I found resting in the
shade of a tent made of bags had a brass
badge in his coat, and I stopped to chat about
A.I.F. days. Presently there arrived a
young woman, obviously tired out, whom my
fellow-Digger introduced as his wife and
whom I knew by her speech to be English.
Afterwards, while the Digger was peeling
some spuds by the river, she told me that
they had been married in London in 1918.
Her husband had told her he owned a sheep-
station in Australia, but _ she had never
encountered evidence of his owning even a
sheep. Now, since he was unable to find
work, she was keeping the wolf from the
door by picking grapes at a block a mile out
from the township. She hoofed the mile
morning and evening.
* * * *
“X2X” : Under no circumstances would a
corpse interred in an ordinary grave decay
into nothingness in 28 years (B. 24/2/’27).
In the Hobart case mentioned by “J.A.8.F.,”
the missing remains must either have been
removed by body-snatchers, or, as is more
probable, a mistake was made at the funeral
and the body was placed in some other grave.
The fact of cancer having been the cause of
death could scarcely hasten dissolution. The
cancer poisons produced by the affected cells
of the body are made only during life, and
the moment that life ceased their manufac-
ture and distribution through the system
would cease also. When the processes of decay
set in they would be amongst the first to
be transformed by oxidation into more simple
substances: hence the tissues would remain
as though they had never been affected by
the disease.
* * * *
“Hum Spiro”: It happened at a dinner-
party given recently by a member of a big
motor firm, where lady motorists were present
in full force. After retiring to the drawing-
room the women talked of nothing but cars
and speed—all except one demure wisp of a
girl who sat a little apart, very quietly. At
last one of the others, seeking to draw her
into the conversation, began a little boasting
of how she and her friend could step on it.
She finished up with “Have you a car?”
“Yes,” murmured the demure one, “a little
one.” One of the others asked cattily, “A
Ford?” The demure one said not a word. She
just reached for her little silver bag and
drew from it a piece of paper, which she
handed to her questioners. There was dead
silence. It was a Maroubra speed certificate
certifying that she had driven her straight-
eight Bugatti at 87 miles per hour for three
laps.
* * * *
“Alpham” : Feminine extravagance on the
upkeep of hair (B. 3/3/’27) is no new thing.
Even in Biblical times, care of the hair and
beard seems to have involved considerable
expense. Isaiah launched a dread threat of
baldness against the loose daughters of Zion,
and Jezebel “tired her head” preparatory to
a vamping campaign. A man’s beard was as
much respected as a woman’s crowning glory •
Joab grasped Amasa by the beard with
the right hand to kiss him. Shaving was a
sign of mourning, and also of degradation.
Hanun, suspecting David’s emissaries of
being spies, subjected them to the indignity
of shaving half their beards. Isaiah utters
the curious threat, “The Lord shall shave
with a razor that is hired....the head, and
the hair of the feet; it shall also consume
the beard.”
* * * *
“0.Q.”: There are still some Australians
whose morale hasn’t been undermined by the
movies. When a masked man, making signifi-
cant clutches at his hip-pocket, ordered Mrs.
Mary Bassett, a Richmond
(Melb.) shopkeeper, to hand
over the till, she said she would
do nothing of the sort. She also
invited him to shoot her with
whatever it was he was so
strenuously endeavoring to haul
from his clothing. A small boy
then entered and also refused
to be intimidated, despite a
frantic renewal of the Holly-
wood pantomime. Whereupon
the desperado faded out.
“Merris”: It must be mor.
than unusual to find a foreman
carpenter who can neither read
nor write, but years ago I ran
across one in a South Austra-
lian mining district. Old Ned
Tregilgas, however, always
carried a notebook, and when
receiving instructions about a
job he would fill it with quaint
hieroglyphics, the key to which
was never discovered. It was
darkly suspected, however, that
the notebook was mere camou-
flage, and that he really trusted
all details to his memory. Old
Ned was very touchy about the
dignity of his office, and one
day he grew wrathful when the
fitters “borrowed” his pet hand-
truck without first obtaining
permission. “Billy, boay,” lie
growled, “take and brand they
truck ‘Carpenters’ Shop.’ ”
"What shall us put on un.
Mister ?” asked the guileful
Billy. “Brand un ‘S.P.Q.R..
o' course,” blustered the old
man. And Billy carried out
his instructions to the letter.
“Red Jorkins”: Duty had
called the sergeant and his only
constable away for a couple of
days from their headquarters in
the far west of N. S. Wales,
and .Toe and Moogi, the black-
trackers, remained the only visible
embodiments of law and order in
the slab-sided tin-roofed shed that
did duty as a police station.
The pair were penniless and
thirsty, and the appearance of
Tarpot the Syrian, a typical
out-back hawker, in his dilapi-
dated van gave them an idea.
AVhen the hawker stopped out-
side .Toe slouched out and de-
manded the production of his
license. Dike most of his kind.
Tarpot had stored in his van
all the tobacco, dog and
hawker's licenses which he had
purchased in the last 20 years.
Having little idea which was
which, he cheerfully handed the
bundle to the inquisitor and
told him to take his pick. This
.Toe disdained to do and pro-
ceeded to pinch the hapless
hawker without further argu-
ment. He then hauled him
into the charge-room, where
Moogi, now changed into mufti
and wearing a borrowed collar
upside down, was seated behind
the rough deal table that did
duty as a bench. .Toe made the
charge and Moogi fixed the fine
—a fiver. The staggered Tar-
pot had a notion that the pro-
ceedings were a bit ultra vires,
and at first refused to pay. but
when his captors bunged him
into the cell and slammed the
door lie thought better of it.
When the sergeant returned a
day later the hawker lobbed in
to lodge an appeal against the
conviction. That officer, on
being placed in possession of
the facts, lost no time in quash-
ing it. and bolted round to the
pub, but it was too late; the
fiver was safe in Bung’s till.
The sergeant, being a just man.
reimbursed Tarpot from his
own pocket, but pay-day meant
nothing to Joe and Moogi for
a good many months after-
wards.
“Tamornie” : Nobody need scoff at faith-
healing where native races .are concerned. A
Kanaka who was working for me in New
tinmen developed double pneumonia and.
despite skilled treatment, rapidly became so
bad that lie was given up. Between periods
of semi-delirium he begged to be allowed to
return to his island, 12 miles distant, where
lived his brother, a noted sorcerer. The
sick man claimed that he had been be witch eo
and his chest filled with broken shells. H’s
friends carried him away late one night and.
merely as a matter of form, I sent a message
telling him to be back in two weeks. Twelve
days later, to my absolute amazement, lie
returned hale and hearty, and told me that
his brother had extracted the broken sheik
and cured him. There is not the slightest
doubt that had this boy not gone to lm
home he would have died. No European
doctor could have doue anything for him.

“Duero” : That Maoriland is a slow coun-
try is the opinion of a lady from Cincinnati,
whp recently went out in her car for a run

ing, but they don’t know what they can do about it."

round Christchurch. She had no license,
but that did not deter her from dashing
through city streets, across intersections
and round corners at a speed of 40 miles
an hour. When an agitated inspector over-
hauled her, the lady merely remarked with
a bright smile that she was thoroughly enjoy-
ing her spin. The Court listened coldly to
the excuse that they do things, much faster
in the States, and handed out a fine of £lO
and costs.

“The Deacon” : There are other incentives
to commercial immorality besides whisky
and the ponies. Yesterday morning I met
Firkins, an eminently respectable figure in
Church and rag-warehouse circles. His thick
jowl was swelling with virtuous indig-
nation. “The low thieves,” he kept mutter-
ing; “the low thieves!” And presently I got
his story. The up-line suburb where Fir-
kins lives is heavily respectable, with a
friendly rivalry always in evidence between
the garden-owners. The local bumbles had
decreed that a certain street should be
asphalted, and as a preliminary several
THE INFALLIBLE SIGN.
TOM: “And how is your husband, Mrs. Wayne?"
MRS. WAYNE: “Oh, middlin'. I have to keep a tight rein on him; but, thank good-
ness, I can always tell when he's had enough—-he wants to kiss me."
lorry-loads of sand were sent up by order of
the Mayor, a person so steeped in trade that
lie knows nothing whatever about carnations
and their requirements at certain seasons of
the year. The loads were left invitingly
on the edge of the roadway. Firkins admits
that he noticed Briefs and Scalpel look at
the sand speculatively _as they all passed
together towards the railway station, but he
was entirely unsuspicious. Consequently
when he slipped down the length of the street
just before dawn that morning with a modest
pair of coal-buckets to collect his issue, there
wasn't a skerrick of sand left. “The dirty
thieves !” he was still repeating as I left him.

“Retired Volt”: It isn’t only the Navy
tliat may profit by the theories of an out-
sider (B. 24/2/'27). The “practical” man
always affects to despise the theorist, regard-
less of the fact that the practice at which
he earns liis bread
and butter must
once have been
pure theory. Shore
telegraphy, for in-
stance, owes a good
deal to a South
Australian, George
Wald, and would
have owed more if
he hadn’t been cut
off in the Singa-
pore Mutiny. Wald
was employed on a
repairing ship, and
his knowledge of
shore offices was
confined to drop-
ping in at the end
of a repair to ex-
change the time of
day. He was once
in London when
there was serious
trouble in the big-
gest cable station
in the Empire—ill
Cornwall. With-
out troubling to
visit the seat of
the disturbance, he went into conference with
a piece of paper and a pencil, and produced
a solution. He was right, too, much to the
surprise of the local electricians.

“Nikko”: As the Maoriland Government
does not permit the sale of trout it is the
custom for the local fisli-lovers to patrol the
banks of likely streams and annex that por-
tion of the spoils not required by the
anglers. When Sir Tom- Bridges. S.A.’s
Governor, caught 16 fine trout at Tokaanu
during the visit of the Renown anglers it
was decided that the haul would provide a
welcome change in the menu for those left
oh the ship. Meanwhile, however, Hone and
Henare, more suo, had gleefully apportioned
the catch, and when the Renown officer
arrived he found the bank was bare. Dis-
tractedly mopping his perspiring brow lie
called wildly for the police, who, familiar
with local custom, rushed hastily round and
tried to re-assemble the catch. From kit-
chens and wharcs and even frying-pans the
august trout were retrieved by the law, and
the stay-at-homes on the battleship had their
trout dinner, though some of the fish were in
a fragmentary condition.
“M.L.C.” : It isn’t all plain sailing for the
arrangers of the York itineraries. In Tas-
mania it was decided that the royalties should
stay a few minutes at the Campbelltown rail-
way station en route to Launceston, and word
was passed to the local council that the
visitors would like to meet any new settlers
who were available, to shake hands with
old identities, and to pass the time of day
with Barnardo boys, as well as the local
school children. To this the council replied
plaintively that, as far as new settlers were
concerned, there were hardly any in the dis-
trict ; there were absolutely no Barnado boys :
most of the old residents had died in the last
few years; and, anyway, the schools would
be closed. The attractions of Campbelltown
are briefly summed up in the guide-books as
“Sheep grazing,” but the council refrained
from suggesting that the Duke and Duchess
might enlarge their impressions of the Speck
by having a look at that in the absence of
old inhabitants and new arrivals.
* * * *
“Sandhurst”: Somebody in England has
revived the ancient controversy about the
origin of Bendigo’s name. R. R. Haverfield,
for many years editor of the Bendigo Adver-
tiser, collected all the known facts. In
1838 lie knew Charles Sherrard, who
owned the Ravenswood sheep-station, from
south of Big Hill to the Barnedown sheep
run, 30 miles north on the river Campaspe.
Sherrard sold out to lieape and Grice, who
in turn parted with the station to Gibson
and Fenton ; these last owned the valley of
the Bendigo Creek when gold was found
at Golden-snuare in 1851. Haverfield says
that there was a shepherd or hut-keeper in
the employ of Sherrard who claimed to be
an accomplished bruiser, and so was nick-
named Bendigo after the English fighting-
man. Hence the creek running through an
out-station received its name from this
obscure person.

“Mako” : The domestic cat can be as effec-
tive a firebug as the rabbit (B. 17/2/’27).
Some years ago a Christchurch (M.L.)
woman came in from her garden at eventide
and found a strange eat looking longingly
at her canary. She promptly chased the cat,
which, in dashing through the kitciien, jumped
on the table aiul upset a kerosene lamp. The
blazing cat pursued its wild career through
the next-door house, igniting a fringed table-
cover on the way. and finally arrived home
at the third house to set some shavings on
the verandah aflame. Result, three cottages
with small conflagrations on hand,’ and two
householders in hospital with badly burnt
hands. The cat was not sighted for two
days, when she crawled home and resumed
: life as usual.

“The Deacon”: The rigid law laid down
■ b” the R.C. ecclesiastical authorities to their
young neophytes in college is never to coun-
tenance a separation between husband and
wife. But there is an exception ; • that is,
when either or both seek dissolution of mar-
riage to devote the rest of life to religion.
They are, of course, required to furnish con-
vincing proof of their bona fides, which isn’t
anvays easy. But there was a dinkum case
in an Australian capital just recently. Both
parties were quite prepared to obey the dic-
tates of the Church, which lays down that
the wife must join up with a convent and the
husband with some religious order. And
each has since done so. In every textbook
for ecclesiastical students such a case is
provided for, with a warning that it must be
searcliingly investigated.

“Millions Clubber”: Preston, the brick-
making suburb of Melbourne, is afflicted with
a plague of rats reminiscent of Hamelin
town. The nuisance began in a municipal
rubbish tip full of decaying crayfish, hides,
fish-heads and all the other delicatessen
beloved by rats, and there the rodents have
been multiplying as fast as applicants for
free tickets to the Canberra festivities. Hav-
ing exhausted what the tip had to offer the
intruders took to running round the yards
in daylight, and sank holes under cement
floors. They jazzed on the ceilings and
undermined the sinks, the gardens and the
drains. In one house the carpets and lino-
leums were eaten, and the owner awoke to
find the rats had eaten one of the legs of his
best trousers—devoured it to the last stitch.
The Preston Council in desperation offered
3d. per rat head to the youngsters, but this
led to such a total abandonment of school
work that the outcry of the parents could
have been heard at Mount Macedon. So the
council put on a rat-catcher, with 10 fox-
terriers, who accounted for over 2000 in a
week or two. At this stage the bank manager
said there was a limit to the council’s over-
draft, and refused to honor any more cheques
for dead rats. At latest the Mayor had orga-
nised moonlight rifle shooting from the top
of the pit, and hundreds of rats were being
missed nightly by enthusiastic marksmen.

“F.A.L.” : There is nothing like a fire for
making people momentarily lose all sense of
proportion. I have seen frenzied house-
holders throwing their crockery from upstairs
windows and then carefully carrying
bedding down to the street. Men will
return to blazing buildings to rescue utterly
worthless articles. I know of one who
crawled along a hall and through two
blazing rooms to retrieve a magazine in
which he was reading a serial, and another
who dragged a telephone- off a wall and
carried it out. But perhaps the strangest
property-rescue on record is that credited to
a Greek restaurateur of Sydney. He had
installed a new ice-chest on the premises

a few days before his joint caught fire, and
when most of the other fittings had been
salvaged one of Oysteropoulos’s offsiders ex-
pressed regret that this piece of furniture
had been too cumbrous to think of saving.
His boss promptly turned and dashed into
the blazing building, holding his coat before
his face. After a few moments he staggered
out and dropped something on the footpath
as he coll apseC. The chest itself had been
too heavy to move, but he had grabbed and
carried out a lump of ice.
HOLIDAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“My holidays are due next week,” said Jones, “and
I have planned
To pick a shady spot, beneath a ti-tree on the sand,
And do some solid reading; modern piffle shall be
banned.”
Jones made his suitcase heavy with .a pile of classic
lore;
He sought and found a ti-tree by the lazy, crooning
shore;
Hut neither pipe nor Pepys availed and Jones began
to snore.
Next day he took a hand at bridge, then sought his
neck-to-knee.
With duck-dives, crawls and somersaults he frolicked
in the sea.
That night the banal flicks found Jones where he
ought not to be.
A fishing-trip struck Brown as just the thing that
he required.
He spoke of bait and tackle till his bosom friends
were tired ;
Then got his kit together, hustling like a man
inspired.
He sought and found a river—and, with bitterness
of soul,
Sat smothered by a smoke-screen, while the sand-
flies ate him whole.
At eventide the stabbing ’sheets descended in a
shoal.
Next morn the dying embers and a lonely dead
marine
Were all that showed the wayfarer where once
Brown’s tent had been :
The glutted swarms of sandflies made the foreground
of the scene.
“A walking-tour,” said Smith, with an anticipativc
smile,
“With fresh unhackneyed beauties opening out at
every mile,
And vast untrammelled spaces, makes a holiday worth
while.”
With knapsack and with cudgel stout Smith started
off next morn.
He trolled a catch and twirled his stick —until a
shooting corn
At the tenth milestone made him curse the day
that he was born.
I'ive miles from anywhere he limped, his cudgel
thrown aside.
His face was caked with grime, long dead was his
pedestrian pride.
Next day per motor-’bus he fared, a passenger, inside.

j to the spirit as well as the letter of the ideal of Co-operation. For
example, its Policy-holders are protected against forfeiture of their
policies during seasonal emergencies; each year definite sums are
earmarked for loan purposes; while the Company’s intimate know-

Rt. Rev. G. A. D’ARCY-IRVINE , Bishop-
Coadjutor of Sydney.
.Tust-dead Alberto Zelman, who should have
conducted the Melbourne Symphony Orches-
tra at Melba’s home-coming concert, had an
unusually cosmopolitan experience with the
baton. He directed the Berlin Philharmonic
Orchestra while on a visit in 1922, and the
Germans liked him so much that they in-
vited him to conduct another concert. In
the same year he conducted the London
Symphony Orchestra through two pro-
grammes. His local record included 32 per-
formances of “The Messiah” by the Mel-
bourne Philharmonics, and the founding and
successful steering of his own symphony
orchestra. Alberto was born in Carlton in
1874.
Fred Leist has returned from England and
the U.S.A. to compare his Sydney Harbor
with the original. Leist’s harbor was the
famous model at Wembley, for the construc-
tion of which he was commissioned by Aus-
tralia House. An American real-estate mil-
lionaire. D. P. Davis, was so taken by the
model that he snapped Leist up to help him
to develop Davis’s grandiose scheme for
beauty sites in Florida. The subsequent
slump in that scheme and the cyclone left
Davis stranded; and shortly afterwards he
died. Leist has done many portraits and
pictures of picturesque America, especially
of the old Spanish mission houses.
When he visited Sydney Art Gallery, Dr.
Winnington Ingram must have paused before
the Shannon portrait of Lady Ulrica Bar-
ing. Iler engagement to the then youthful
but already famous bishop was announced
nearly 30 years ago. The lady was tin*
daughter of the Earl of Feversham, th ■
youngest of a quartette of sisters famous for
their good looks; Disraeli said, “I don’t
believe there ever could be an ugly Fever-
sham girl.” Ingram, however, remained a
bachelor, and the lady married one of the
banking Barings.
The passing of lawyer-legislator A. ,T.
Tliynne, of Brisbane, leaves Dr. Cookbiiru,
sometime S.A. Premier, the only survivor of
the 45 members of the Sydney 1893 Federa-
tion Convention, presided over by Parkes.
Coekburn is also the last of the Federation
Conventionists at Melbourne in 1890. Now
in His 77th year, he is spending his declin-
ing days in England.
The other day Apostolic Delegate Cattaneo
took a trip to the Annie Isle to place the
pallium on the shoulders of the latest Aus-
tralian R.C. archoishop. This is William
Barry, a brilliant graduate of All Hallows’,
who arrived at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney,
in the late ’nineties. An orator of note, he was
in great demand, and on one occasion, with
two others, lie was sent by Archbishop Kelly
to Bananaland to raise the cathedral debt.
It was shortly after this successful trip that
he got the Apple Isle crozier. Archbishop
Barry is crowding 60.
Carl Streich, who used to represent Adel-
aide Uni. whenever brain-ctiva-brawn was
required, has just won the jiu-jitsu champion-
ship of the associated sporting clubs of
London. To carry off the belt, Carl had to
meet a Japanese doctor (who, by the way,
introduced him to the game) and a full-
grown metropolitan policeman. A week
after this performance, Streich sat for and
came out top in the examination for member-
ship of the Institute of Public Health. He
is medical superintendent of the Royal Chest
Hospital, East London.
Ted Richards, just dead in the middle
seventies, represented Mudgee (N.S.W.) for
three Parliaments, and fought two of the
closest contests on record. Once he ousted
the late Bob Jones by six votes, and a few
years later he put Jack Haynes out of Par-
liament by nine votes. Always cheerful,
affable and popular was the member for
Mudgee and part-proprietor of the local
Guardian.
There are only two men in the world who
have experienced the thrill of driving a
motor-car at over 170 miles an hour, and one
of them was an Australian, Parry Thomas,
who met liis death on Pendine Sands, in
Wales, where lie was attempting to better
the time of Captain Malcolm Campbell. Like
most huge racing cars, Thomas’s machine had
a chain drive. Just as he had worked up to
full speed the chain snapped, and, lashing
up through the floor-boards, coiled round his
neck, killing him instantly. The car, released
from control, skidded sideways, overturned,
and lay upon its dead driver.
William Mitchel Wanliss Irvine, son of
the C.J. of Vic., was admitted to the
Bar in Melbourne the other day. He was
named William after his dad, Mitchel after
his grand-uncle, John Mitchel, the Irish
patriot, and Wanliss after his maternal
grand-dad, T.D., who was a member of Vic.
Dreary House from 3,893 to 3898.
Dick Forrest, who goes from the charge
of the Pensions Department of Sydney
Repat. to the Pensions Offices in London, is
one of the few who left a cushy job with a
non-combatant unit of -the A.I.F. to get
iiuo the line. He went away with the Pay
Branch in 3915, but in 1937. when the call
to fill the blanks in the lighting ranks became
insistent, lie got a commission in the Ist
Division. He became Q.M. of the Ist Batta-
lion, and was then attached to the Yanks to
prepare them for their attack on the Hinden-
burg line. Forrest got a captaincy and the
Military Cross out of his line exploits. After
the Armistice he managed the A.I.F. football
team in France.
Roger Keyes, who is booked to succeed
Beatty at the Admiralty, was Commodore
commanding a submarine flotilla at the be-
ginning of the war. Taking over the Dover
Patrol from Bacon in December. 1917, he
planned and carried out the Zeehrugge opera-
tions, in, which the destroyer Warwick flew
his flag., Beatty will not retire, but he will
not be actively employed again. An Admiral
of the fleet is permanently on full pay and
never flies his flag, the Union Jack, at sea.
In order, however, that his flag may actually
have been flown it is usual to hoist it for
24 hours in the President, the old hulk on
the Thames on whose books all officers at
the Admiralty and the R. N. College. Green-
wich, are borne. Keyes has a genius for
planning and organising, and his appoint-
ment ought to please the service.
Nobody would think of taking away from
Captain James 11. Watson the job his en-
thusiasm enables him to do so well, and at
85 he has been elected President of the Aus-
tralian Historical Society for another year.
Watson's zeal for the cause of historical
research could not be greater if he were
native born, but he was 24 years old when
he landed in this country to become one of
the founders of the Sydney furnishing firm
of Beard, Watson and Co. His military title
is a relic of the volunteer days.
Westralian Senator GRAHAM.
A versatile soul was “Darby” Ryan, who,
after running the Lake Taupo (M.L.)
launch service for years, has become a passen-
ger of Charon, at 63. Forty years ago he
was one of the stout fellows who crossed
the Tasman to teach Australians how to
play Rugby football, and who suffered not
one defeat. Then, deciding to make a name
for himself as a painter, he studied in Paris
for some years, and turned out some very
creditable landscapes. After that lie switched
back to an early love and became a launch pro-
prietor, with yachting as a hobby. “Darby”
met hundreds of fishermen and yachtsmen
from all parts of the world, and all will be
sorry to hear that he has gone.
A Kew (Vic. 1 resident has been offered
the job of chief officer of one of the air
liners to be flown on the Britain to Aus-
tralia route. He is Lieut.-Commander N. G.
Atherstone, R.N., and he served on the
lighter-than-air craft that watched the coasts
of the Cold Land during the war.
Canon Hey Sharp, who, at 82, is resign-
ing the job of Registrar of the Australian
College of Theology, which he has held for
21 years, came to Australia 54 years ago
as assistant-master and chaplain of St.
Peter’s College, Adelaide. Five years later
he became warden of St. Paul’s College, and
stayed in that position until he took the one
he is just resigning. Professor Farr, of
Christchurch (M.L.), and Edwin Black-
more, who was the first Clerk of the Federal
Parliament, are brothers-in-law.
A Salv’army officer who won admiration
as well as respect from Diggers was “Fighting
Mac” (Chaplain-Colonel McKenzie), who
distinguished himself on Gallipoli by a
superb indifference to danger. After the
war Mac devoted himself to shepherding
down-and-out Diggers in Sydney. Now lie
is being sent off to take charge of S. Army
affairs in North China, where, in present
circumstances, he ought to feel quite at
home. “Fighting Mac’s” closest pal on Gal-
lipoli was Father Fahey, of Westralia.
Mark Johnston Symons, sometime presi-
dent of the South Aus. branch of the B.M.A.
will be seen on Nortli-terrace, Adelaide, no
more. He landed in Adelaide in 1883, being
then 29, with a reputation for eye work won
at Moorfields Hospital, London. Hfc became
ophthalmic surgeon to Adelaide and Children's
hospitals, and lecturer at Adelaide Uni. His
widow is one of the Edward Spicer clan.
After drawing a pension of about £6OO a
year for nearly 20 years, David Martin, ex-
Sec. for Public Works and Agriculture (Vic.),
was called aloft the other day. As first per-
manent head of the Agricultural Department,
under Minister J. L. Dow, Martin’s job
was to develop the butter export trade, a
task that was helped by the bonus the Gillies-
Deakin Government provided. In Martin’s
time the Agricultural Department was quite
a modest affair, and lie developed methods
which he found it difficult to shed when he
got the headship of the Public Works Depart-
ment. A plodder rather than an innovator,
he was a safe man to have alongside a
Minister inclined to bid for popularity and
damn the expense. He was able to restrain
Tommy Bent from a deal of plunging.
The cablegram describing how Chelmsford
used a multiple fountain-pen contraption to
sign N.S.W. loan bonds in N’York recalls a
yarn about Brassoy, when that nautical-
minded gentleman was Governor of Vic. A
fal 1 from a horse put his right arm out of
action. There was an accumulation of leases
and grants to sign, and his Ex. ordered a
rubber-stamp of his signature, which a fac-
totum applied with a will. When the parch-
ments and papers were returned to the
Lands a precise officer in the deeds branch
nearly took a fit. Bobby Best, a lawyer, who
was Minister, was appealed to. He promptly
upheld his officer's objection, and Brassey had
to sign the heap with his left hand. His
remarks while rlie painfully pushed the un-
willing pen smacked strongly of salt water.
Canon Champion, for 11 years headmaster
of King’s School, Parramatta, and sub-
sequently rector of parishes in the diocese
of Goulburn, including Canberra and Lake
Bathurst, has been presented to the living
of Northstoke, Bath, England. Two of his
sons fell in action in France. The eldest
son, A. 11., who was an officer in the same
Australian brigade as his brothers, is man-
ager at Adelaide of the C. S. R. Co.
John Gordon, who had to be persuaded so
strongly by his party to vote for the Vic.
Assembly redistribution scheme on the day
it was carried last session by the casting
vote of Speaker Bowser, has decided not to
offer himself for re-election. His constituency
(Waranga) was hacked to pieces. Remnants
of several old constituencies make up the
new Waranga, but there is little doubt that
Gordon could win it if he chose to try. He
was formerly chairman of the Municipal
Association of Vic., was Minister' for Agri-
culture under Lawson and Peacock in 1924.
and before that was honorary Minister in
the Lawson-Allan Coalition.
Although supposed to be enjoying retire-
ment at Leura (N.S.W.), Peter Board, some-
time Director of Education, journeys to
Sydney twice a week to give attention to the
N.S.W. share of the scheme for educating
the children of dead Diggers. Board was
chairman of the first board appointed by
Repat. to supervise the scheme in N.S.W.;
and. although he was automatically sup-
planted by S. 11. Smith when the latter
became Director of Education, Repat. found
another place for him on the governing body.
The N.S.W. board has already passed 450
youngsters through a training course into
the occupations they have chosen, and has
between 700 and 800 going through appren-
ticeships and approximately another thousand
at school. Board takes a personal interest
in the youngsters, and has done some ener-
getic scouting amongst his friends for appren-
ticeship openings.
EXCITED PARENT (malting a late call on the
family physician ): “Doctor, doctor ,
come at once! Bahy swallowed the
latch-key on the way home from
mother’s, and we can’t get in!”
Dead at 43, John Sells, one of the best
known pursers on the run between here and
Blighty. He was in the Otranto and Omra.i
when they were sunk during the war; and
later, as a member of the R.N.R.. helped
the Tiger to do her bit at Jutland and
Dogger Bank. Then he joined one of the
mystery ships and got a D.S.Q.'for -helping
to sink a Hun sub. After the Armistice he
went back to pursering, and served in the
Orontes and Ormuz.
Randwick’s oldest inhabitant, John Aylin.
who will be 95 in September, remembers the
coronation of Victoria —his father kept-a
pub which did a roaring trade on that occa-
sion. Gold lured him here when lie was still
a youth ; but he found there was more of it
in contracting than he ever got out of a
mine.
A DECENT SORT OF BLOKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[ was introduced quite simply—it was in a private
bar,
Where the cheapest drink is ninepence and the
shingled angels are.
lie was down at heel and wretched ; he was just a
city soak;
Hut the words that introduced us were “A decent
sort of bloke.”
He was frankly on his uppers; shouts, ’twas clear,
he couldn’t return ;
He had scarcely any pockets that a bit of cash
might burn—•
Hut I lent the chap some money, knowing by the
way he spoke
That he’d bring it back in season as “a decent sort
of bloke.”
And I thought, as he went stumbling on his wav to
find a. job,
Of the hungry days Vd stumbled on a solitary bob.
How the poor, plain men remember, and the rich,
proud men forget— :
Oh, I found myself a-tliinking of the decent blokes
I’d met.
There was one who gave me tucker on a sunburnt
western track,
He could ill afford to give it —and he never got
it back ;
Oh, I tried to thank the fellow, but he took it as
a joke,
For there’s something mighty decent in “a decent
sort of bloke.”
There were others just as kindly, though I can’t
recall a name.
All they had was yours for asking, and their code
was much the same.
They would put no snobbish questions—they were
not the sort to boast:
It was what you were, not who you were, that
mattered to them most.
So when earthly joys are ovei - —well, I hope I
don’t forget
All the decent things that happened and the decent
blokes I met;
I’m prepared to die unshriven if some understanding
folk
I’ut my name with those remembered as “a decent
sort of bloke!”

SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
COHEN ( showing friend new bathroom ): “There, now, ain’t it
pootiful, my poy! Is it any wonder that I look forward to
Saturday night?”
“Wang” ; A friend of mine who does a bit
of poultry-raising in a small way assures
me that the following is true. For some
time he had been losing newly-hatched
chicks. He didn’t blame rats, as the chicks
were housed in coops made of wire-netting
of a mesh too small for rats to get through,
tb ough large enough to allow the wee birds
to pass in or out. One day he hid and
watched. After some time had elapsed he
saw a fat rat approach the coop, and crouch
behind a board where he couldn’t be seen
by the old hen or the chicks. The only
part they could see was his tail lying on
the ground. Presently he gave it a slight
wriggle, and a chick, attracted by the size of
the worm, made a rush at it. As it moved
away, the chick followed it, and the rest was
easy for the rat.
* * * *
“Spadger”: Dad routed out the new hand
at four o’clock on a winter’s morning, and
sent him off to bring in the cows. An hour
later he returned without them. “I looked
for them in all the likely places,” he ex-
plained. “Looked in the likely places, did
yer?” bellowed Dad. “Well, go and look in
the unlikely places now.” The new hand
grunted to himself. “Well, I reckon bed’s the
most unlikely place!” And back to bed he went.
“Fitzwilliam”: I see somebody is try-
ing to raise the “cat-’possum” myth again.
How lias he arranged for the two great life
processes, nutriment and reproduction? As
regards the former, I have yet to hear of a
cat that will eat gum-leaves or a ’possum
that takes to mice. As regards reproduc-
tion, does it incline to a placenta or a pouch
or both? It should not be necessary to
explain that, while nearly allied species have
been known to mate, such a happening has
never been verified between animals of differ-
ent genera—-not to speak of families or natu-
ral orders. It is true that cases have been
recorded, but so far they have not yet been
verified.
“Pick”: With animals so dissimilar in
anatomy, habits and modes of feeding as
cat and ’possum, a cross seems improbable.
Yet, this was my experience: At old Jincum-
billy, on the Monaro Plains (N.S.W.), at
our boundary-rider’s mansion was kept one
cat only, a female, and in the willows near
by a buck ’possum had taken up his home-
stead lease. Nightly the pair played chasings
in the orchard, and often they shared a
sleeping-fork in the willow. After a time
Tabbie hawked in a kitten. It had the young
’possum color and frizzly fur, a bushy tail,
and, when grown, the habit of squatting on
the limbs of trees, with tail curled under-
neath, ’possum fashion. Otherwise its cus-
toms were purely cattish. It dieted on
lizards and mice, purred in contentment, and
spat curses when angry.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad”: The spectators in the
Thursday Island picture-show present a
study in color, from pure white through all
its stages to black-
est ebony. And
the darker shades
predominate by ten
to one. At present
it is the Jap sea-
son, this being lay-
ing-up time in the
shelling fleets. Cow-
boy pictures, with
plenty of shooting,
are favorite films,
but the crowning
joy is the sheik
flick, in which the
dusky nomads give
the whites the devil
of a towelling. In
a picture recently
shown, as the
whites were being
slaughtered the
applause became
enthusiastic, and
when the sheik car-
ried off the strug-
gling heroine, to be
later on man-
handled by dusky
subordinates in the
slave-market, the
acclaim hit .the
skies. One parti-
cular scene, where
a nigger concealed
behind a curtain
successfully shot a
white man in the
back, was received
with frantic plaud-
its. In the final
tableau, where love,
beauty and white
blood triumphed,
the colored portion
of the audience
didn’t appear to be
interested. It shows
the way the wind
is blowing. The
white nations are
thoughtlessly invit-
ing trouble by
showing this class
of picture—Ameri-
can, of course, to colored audiences.
“Kirk”: What is it the bees collect from
the leaves of the silver wattle? Hearing
a lot of bees busy in a wattle-tree, some
montns after the flowering season, my curi-
osity was aroused. On examination I found
that they were collecting a colorless sticky
substance from the mid-ribs of the wattle-
leaves. It was contained on the surface in
a small cavity at each joint where the small
sections were joined to the mid-rib. It can’t
be honey, but the bees were as keen after
it as if it w r ere.
BUT HE MEANT IT KINDLY.
“Look here, three out of the dozen apples you sent me were rotten. I'll bring them
back if you like.”
“Tha’s orlright, Mum. Yer word’s as good as the apples .”
“Queensland Nut”: One sweltering day
recently I was trying to entertain some
cocky friends by introducing them to Aus-
tralian poetry, and, by way of contrast with
our environment, I chose poems about
the sea. Presently I came to that favorite
one by Bod Quinn, wherein the four men
and their inland-bred horses vision the sea
for the first time. My friends’ interest was
keen until I came to the final flourish, where
horses and riders go rapturously into the
waves. Then scoffed one: “Just what
you’d expect oi a poet! Whoever saw a bush-
bred horse that would rush into the ocean
like that first time he saw it!” We argued
warmly, but although I have seen many
horses in the sea, enjoying it, I cannot
claim that any of them were bush-bred and
by the sea for the first time. I’d like to
hear the truth of the matter.
* * * *
“Up Top” : Once a flock of tiny sea-snipe
guided me to a quick £5O on a stretch
of the west coast of Cape York Penin-
sula. It was a dark night during the turtle
season. On bare feet I patrolled the beach,
listening for the gasping hiss of turtle when
they rose upon the surface of the water,
and for their subsequent energetic scratch-
ing on the sand. Suddenly a bevy of un-
seen snipe twittered antagonistically. I
hurried to the sound, and there saw Mrs.
Turtle busily digging her nest. I allowed
her to deposit her eggs before turning her
on her back, for on the performance of that
duly depended at least 100 future little
turtles. Along the beach the snipe twittered
again. I marathoned into the darkness, and
secured another prize. Altogether, the night
brought me 14 first-class shells.

“E.S.” : “It’s sometimes necessary to half
kill a man to save his life,” said Bill. “I
travelled once with a drover mate who
couldn’t swim an’ couldn’t be induced to
try; an’ as we had flooded streams to cross
now and again, I drilled him in camp an’
gave him suitable advice for every emergency
I thought might arise. Then, while crossin’
a flooded billabong at Charleville, he got
adrift in mid-stream, an’ when I went to
his assistance he clutched me round the
neck and nearly drowned me. He’d for-
gotten all his schoolin’. I grabbed a floatin'

“The Jumper”: “Herodot’s” yarn (B.
8/2/’27) about a snake charming a Sydney
woman makes me want to shout till the roof
comes down. Let me tell him, and that Syd-
ney woman too, that all those peculiar sea
sations experienced by the good lady on
awakening to behold a snake looking out at
her from the grass at her feet were nothin*
more nor less than the sensations produced
by fear —paralysing, but stupid fear. I have
Known ordinarily quite sensible women to
become completely helpless on being con-
fronted suddenlv by a snake, and yet of the
two the reptile was probably the more terri-
fied. I wonder when all this nauseating non-
sense about snakes and their “charming"
ways is going to end? Hardly while there
are snakes, hysterical men and women and
mugs to believe the yarns.
“Jimmy Possum”: I have heard a lot
about snakes being able to hypnotise birds;
but in all my wanderings, and I’m not a
nipper, I have never once seen a bird under
the hypnotic influence of a snake, nor have I
observed anything that might have been mis-
taken for charming. On the other hand. I
have stood and watched small birds harass-
ing snakes of various sizes and species, and
during the summer months it is quite com-
mon found our house to hear small birds
uttering their alarm-call as they sit eyeing
a waiting wriggler a few feet away. Never
once have I had to rescue a bird; but often
I’ve been vastly amused to see a 6ft. slitherer
sliding for all he was worth to escape the
pecks of a handful of small feathered furies
that his snakeship might have gobbled up
in a couple of mouthfuls. My experience
has been that when a bird falls a victim to
a snake it is taken by surprise, the reptile
either coming on it unawares or the bird
settling down within striking distance of
the lurking enemy.
* * * *
“Dinkum”: Bananaland has its own
remedy for dogs which have been bitten by
a snake. It has proved to be an excellent
one. This remedy is simply the juice of a
banana sucker squeezed into a receptacle
and poured down the animal’s throat. Two
dogs recently treated thus suffered pain for
a few hours, but by the next day were as
fit as ever. Others, too, have proved its
efficacy.
“P.W.D.”: All landholders in south-
east S.A. use bluestone, a piece as big li-
the tip of a Anger forced down the dog>
throat, as a remedy for poisoning. It ha;
never been known to fail. Slit. the dog-
ear if he is in a fit or if there is delay m
procuring the bluestone.
* * * *
“Sucre”: It is not correct, “Telor’ (B-
-17/2/’27), that the nearest prickly-pear to
the Cooper is about 200 miles from tna
watercourse. The Cooper stretches tro -
Windorah to Lake Eyre (north), and spu
part of its water into Lake Yama-iani.'
near Haddon Corner. There is enough pea-
on the journey to supply the world, if
world wanted it.
OUT BACK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I am riding up the furrows as you stroll about the
towns,
City lads beside your lasses with the subtly scented
gowns,
And I wonder if you’d change your place with me
upon the plains
With a team of eighteen horses, champing bits and
tugging reins.
In your pretty red-brick villas with their lawns and
gardens neat,
Where your city parks and shaded walks protect you
from the heat,
You would hardly be remembering the wide and
shadeless tracks,
For you’ve never trod the furrows with the sun
upon your backs.
You step into the ferryboats along the jetty’s side
And hear the hawsers creaking till the vessels out-
ward glide
To the music of the muffled throb of engines down
below ;
There arc country lads who only see the daylight
come and go.
When you’re ready for the movies we’re too tired
to wish to roam,
With sleepy eves we read the news—it’s great to
be at home;
Hut a breath of fragrance borne along will re-awaken
dreams ;
And then we country lads can tell what dinkum
longing means.
As I ride along the furrows I would join you in
the town,
I would catch again the fragrance floating from a
silken gown ;
But I’d miss Old Dinah, Poppet, Baby, plodding up
the loam ;
I’d be out of place among you, for the country is
my home.

“Veronal” : The bellbird —Kendall’s “bell-
bird,” not the crested one—shows a strange
preference for certain mountain gullies, and is
never absent from them while the water supply
holds out. If the creek at the bottom of
the gully dries up, the colony of birds van-
ishes, but returns after rains, when the
creek again flows and its potholes are filled.
These little yellowish-green birds are commu-
nity nesters, several of their delicate bark
cradles being found at times swung from
twigs in a clump of tea-tree. They bathe
often, and sometimes in company with other
small birds. I have seen a couple splashing
in a pool on friendly terms with a gold-
breast whistler, a grey thrush and a scarlet-
breasted robin. Bellbirds, as a rule, search
for food in fairly high trees, and although
the metallic “tink” dins in his ears the
casual wayfarer may pass along a road near
a bellbird’s gully without catching a glimpse
of even one of them. This species is often
confused with the crested bellbird (Orerica,
cristate ), no relation.

“Mars”: In Egypt we were nearly eaten
alive by fleas until the sergeant-major—a
tough old soldier —came to our rescue. Here
is liis tip : Every night strip off your under-
garments, shake them vigorously and then
roll them into as tight and small a wad
KEPT HIS PROMISE.
"How dare you come here in that disgusting condition! And only
a week ago you promised to sign the pledge!”
“An’ so I did- -hie—shign it.”
as you can; soak the bundle in cold water
for about 10 minutes; remove the sodden
mass and wring out vigorously. When suffi-
ciently dry, throw in the fire and put on
clean undergarments.
“Tongio West” : Fleas desert dogs, as rats
do a sinking ship, when pennyroyal is used.
Where it can be gathered, make up a decoc-
tion of the herb once a month, and throw
the dog or cat into it. Where it is not to be
found locally, saturate a cloth with the
druggist’s oil of pennyroyal, and tie the rag
round the dog’s neck. Repeat this per-
formance once a month.
HE DIDN’T KNOW HIS LUCK.
WOWSER: “Outrageous, sir! I can’t possibly occupy this carriage!”
GUARD: “Well, sir, I know scores of gents, who would give up first-class scats to have
the chance you’ve got.”
“P. A. Gog” : A friend of mine has a tame
magpie, likewise a bitch that recently lit-
tered four pups. The bird at once frater-
nised with the doggies, and they became boon
companions. The new arrivals were distri-
buted to friends situated in various parts
of the town, one friend living a considerable
distance away. Maggie was missed one day,
but turned up several hours later. Since
then her unusual disappearances have been
more frequent. Inquiries showed that the
bird had discovered the pups’ new homes and
was calling on them regularly. Three were
not very far away, but how he found the
distant one is a mystery.
* * * *
“Nikko”: Most dogs have in the puppy
stage the habit of carrying off things, but
those with a kelpie
strain appear to
have it always.
Our tyke has re-
tained it all his
life. His favorite
dumping-ground is
a vacant section
near by, and it is
a common sight to
see the family
patrolling it in
search of planted
articles. Anyone
wishing hurriedly
to go into town,
and finding him-
self minus a boot,
loses no time in
argument but im-
mediately seeks the
section, usually re-
turning with the
article, plus a
couple of brushes
or a bag or two.
It has become a
family custom for
members returning
home to make a
slight detour, and
include the section
in their itinerary.
IJnmissed trifles
thus retrieved in-
clude numbers of
useful articles
taken, presumably,
from neighboring
houses. We still
possess an opera
hat, an unworn
satin shoe and a
parcel of lace found
in the repository,
and at intervals
neighbors call with
a list of missing articles and identify their
stolen goods.
* * * *
“Kirk”: A farmer on the n.-w. coast of
Tassie rears his poddy calves in a novel way.
He has a small herd of pure Devons, and
keeps all the progeny. The problem of feed-
ing the calves is solved by attaching four
to one cow and retaining the separated milk
for the rent-paying gentlemen. I can t say
how he manages to persuade Cherry to
mother quartettes, but his poddies are alwuys
creditable to the farm; in fact, look better
fed than those of most farmers who rear
their calves on the separator. The other
extreme may be seen in the showyards in
the spring, when the beef-studmasters take
along two or three nondescript cows to
supply nutriment to the blue-ribbon winners
in the bull classes. It is one of the sights
of the show early in the morning to see a
big four-year-old Hereford bull imbibing
milk from a cow half his size, and when he
has finished looking round for the next drink-
waiter.
* * * *
“Sea Nomad”: Pearl trafficking is occa-
sionally as thrilling as a gamble in opals.
A pearl may be a good one ; but blemished
by a tiny spot. Perhaps it is worth £2OO
as it is. But its brilliant lustre suggests a
gem beneath the enveloping layer; if so,
the pearl may be worth thousands. On the
other hand the enclosed pearl may be a dud.
Shall the owner remove the layer, thus get-
ting rid of the detrimental spot, and risk
exposing a gem or a dud? A Jap diver
recently brought to Thursday Island an
exceptionally fine blister. tie hawked it
round town at £35, without success. It had
a blackish scum on it, and the dissatisfied
Jap decided to take a risk. He did so, and
out rolled a pearl for which he is now asking
£l3OO. A while back some local youngsters
played with an apparently worthless blister.
When shaking it their dad thought he heard
something inside. He broke the blister and
secured a pearl worth £4OO.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Various inland New Guinea
tribes have perfected a suit of cane armor.
It is perfectly made and of sufficient strength
to resist spear, arrow and axe. Someflmes
it is made in two pieces—a body piece
reaching from the throat to past the belt
and a lower piece guarding to a little below
the thighs. The body piece is shaped like
a singlet minus arms and shoulder pieces,
with the throat and back piece of the neck
raised like a high collar. The corselet slips
over the warrior, fitting snugly, but allow-
ing the limbs ample play. The lower por-
tion similarly gives perfect freedom to tin*
thighs. Trader friends have told me of hill
tribes who make a single long-shirt piece of
cane armor. The armor is made from care-
fully picked lawyer-cane, sliced into strands
and then tempered. It is reinforced, and its
shape retained by tough lengths of the cane
intricately laced together by cord-like
strands. In the finished suit there is not
a pinhole showing, nor are any ends of cane
visible. The suit is light, practically ever-
lasting and of wonderful strength. As to it
being impenetrable, I cannot say, but I
should think the object is more to deaden
the shock of the projectile and prevent the
arrow -or other weapon penetrating vitally.
* * * *
“Cog”: Those who, like “J.G.” (B.
10/2/’27), are troubled with woolly aphis
will shortly have no need to resort to spray-
ing, as a most effectual parasite has been
discovered. This hanger-on ( Aplielinus
mali ) was originally discovered in Maori-
land, whence he was introduced into the
Stanthorpe (Q.) orchards less than two
years ago. In that district woolly aphis is
now a thing of the past. Experiments in
W.A., where it was introduced to fight the
citrus black aphis (Siphonophora sp.), also
gave conclusive results. Aphids cluster nor-
mally in colonies, but when the parasite get<
to work they scatter, and are pursued and
done to death individually. In the experi-
ments practically every aphis had been
struck by the parasite. The enemy
approaches her victim, strokes it with her
antennae, then turns round and backs
towards it, shooting out her long ovipositor
and depositing her egg in the posterior por-
tion of the aphid’s body. The ultimate
result, says the report, has been “the com-
plete control of aphis in the trees in which
the test was made.” Now there remains
only the breeding of sufficient colonies of the
parasite for distribution to sound the knell
of the woolly aphis.
* * * »
“Anaf” : Although sulphur in large doses
is a popular remedy for ailing horses, it has
probably killed more than it has cured,
tjiven in large quantities, it has the effect of
increasing the peripheral circulation, and at
the same time opening widely the pores of
the skin, with the result that the animal is
rendered peculiarly susceptible to chills,
which sometimes prove fatal. I know of three
cases in which horses, one of them a well-
bred and valuable racer, have been killed in
this way, although the sicknesses from which
two of them were suffering were so mild
that the animals would probably have soon
recovered without aid. The third horse had
nothing at all the matter with it, the sulphur
having been given simply because its owner
thought it would be the better for it.
* * * *
“Wang” : The story of the rat operating
on the oil bottle with its tail (R. 3/2/’27)
brings to mind an incident that happened
at the Melbourne Hospital some years ago.
The leeches, a supply of which was kept in
open-mouthed glass jars, began to mysteri-
ously disappear. After the stocks had been
depleted several times a young doctor
decided to do a bit of sleuthing. One night
he seated himself in the. room where the
jars were kept, and after a short wait heard
something moving about on the shelf. Keep-
ing perfectly still, he saw a big buck rat
scramble up to the top of one of the jars,
and, seating himself on the edge of it, thrust
his tail into the water. The beasties below
promptly fastened on to it, and when the
fisherman had got several bites he pulled
up and proceeded to refresh himself.
“Black Tracker”: If some of those who
ridicule the idea of eagle-hawks attacking
adults had been at Mount Shanck (S.A.)
on a recent date they would have changed
their opinion. A party of ladies arrived
at the foot of the old crater, and started to
ascend, when a big eagle-hawk disputed pos-
session. It dived and attacked the party in
such a business-like way that the ladies were
glad to beat a retreat. As it had no nest
in the neighborhood and rabbits are plenti-
ful, the reason for the attack is not easily
accounted for. A bird measuring eight
feet four, wing to wing, was shot in the
district on the following day, so the attacker
may have met his death.
* * * *
“Lily-Beale” : While fishing in the Barwon
River below Brewarrina (N.S.W.) recently
a fisherman landed a cod weighing 7910
Besides having several hooks embedded in
its jaws, its stomach, when opened, gave up
a gunmetal watch, three spoons, two tins
and a lady’s gold armlet.

AN ALLITERATIVE EVENING IN THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The sun sinks swooning in a saltbush sea,
An old “Jack’s” joyous jangle jars the camp ;
The deepening dusk draws downward drearily,
And tired toilers through the timber tramp.
The limpid light wanes weakly in the west,
Some scarce-seen stars show scattered in the sky ;
A baby boobook bellows his behest
To feathered friends, and fares on his first fly.
The curlew’s clamor cleaves the clement air,
A bittern booms beneath the black belar,
A wheeling bat whirls wildly whizzing where
The aerial acrobats of evening are.
A wallaby wops wildly on his way,
A rabbit rises with a reckless rush.
And denizens that do not dare the day
Begin to bustle boldly through the bush.
A ringtail resting on a rotten limb
Sits silhouetted sharply ’gainst the sky,
A famished fox flings furious eyes at him,
And turning tail, goes tamely trotting by.
Aquatic choristers soon sing their song,
A catfish chops at something in the sedge,
The rats raise ripples round the billabong,
And massed mosquitoes muster at the edge.
Now faintly flares the friendly fire afar,
Its gladsome glow is glorious to see;
Betimes the Babbler boldly bangs the bar
And clangs the chimes which call the camp to tea.

The arrangements for the royal visit are
going full steam ahead and leaving a trail
of bleeding hearts and wounded feelings in
their wake. The citizens’ welcome canteen
to the men of the Renown is being build ed
up without any assistance from some of those
whose work at the canteen for the American
Fleet might have won them at least an
invitation to be on the committee. But the
workers who meet at the Mint are too busy
to bother about such things. The plans
for transforming No. 1 Wharf, Circular
Quay, into a Rolls-Royce coffee stall are
well advanced, and Harbor Trust architect
Withers, from whose hand the design came,
received his meed of praise from president
Mrs. Philip Street at last week’s meeting.
The florist Fred Searle couple are to have
the decorating of the canteen, and organiser
Mrs. R. C. S. Wilkinson has now over £5OO
in hand to lay out in food and furnishings.
The lady has collected nearly the whole of
this herself. A different host or hostess
will be in charge each day, and this little
honor will cost each £5O in cash, plus ever
so much in kindness. Mrs. Harry Drans-
field and the Lebbeus Hordern couple are
among the latest to add their names to the
list of entertainers.
But surely the February weather is to
blame for the tendency to simmer-over at last
week’s committee meetings. There was gen-
eral wailing and gnashing of teeth among
Boy Scout Ball rollers last Thursday morn-
ing. Not only is H.R.H. not coming to
their ball, despite hopes to the contrary, but
it is now doubtful if the ball will happen
at the appointed time. Cliff Hay (lie’s the
unfortunate M.C. of the royal progress in
this State) seems to be blamed for not
letting the Duke come to this and another
ball being promoted by Sydney’s naicest. But
not only as a cliff but as a rock must he
stand between the royalties and clamoring
committees.
Matrimony has practically played a lone
hand in Sydney’s social round these past
weeks. The old idea of getting yourself mar-
ried before Shrove Tuesday slips into Ash
Wednesday is too deeply rooted to be ignored
entirely, though charity dances in Holy
Week are apparently being encouraged. At
least two big balls are planned to take
place during that once debatable period. The
decorum of the matter was discussed at a
meeting anent the Show Week Ball, and
though the vice-reine looked dubious it was
decided to carry on. One committee woman
pointed to the Show as a precedent. No harm
in show, no harm in ball, seemed to be her
logic. But there were times when for far
less, m’dear, they’d have burned us for
heretics!
St. Mark’s witnessed the nuptials of Nion
Kenyon, of Double Bay, and Flying-Officer
Marshall Allsopp. Nion, who is the youngest
daughter of the Sherrington Kenyon couple
wore white satin for her star appearance:
the skirt of her frock being composed o
shimmering petals of diamente. Aunt Mrs
James Dyer, of Melbourne, lent the wedding
veil, which was rich and rare and of Limerick
weave. Mrs. Fred Coward, in peach-pink
vesture that glowed with rhinestones, and
Betty Balfe, a small but impressive train
bearer, in white moire and silver, attended
the bride. Later, in a perfect bower of roses
and tiger-lilies which before noon had been
a corner of the Ambassadors, the bride’s
mother, in burnt orange bestrewn with
pearls, welcomed the guests, who,were both
numerous and costly.
Edward Lloyd Jones (he’s connected with
Sydney’s ancient fluff firm) came from
Young, and his bride, Jean Vaughan, all
the way from Cootamundra, to St. Stephen’s,
the old Scotclibyterian kirk in Phillip-street,
f °r their passport to the matrimonial state.
csiiK fringe was a feature of the principal
dress. It was deep and luscious, and
gleamed like flax from the waistline to the
liem of the ivory georgette skirt. A train
of silver tissue showed a rosy lining of tulle,
and a veil of silk tulle was secured to the
trim head by a chaplet of orange buds. The
bride’s sister Karlene was her only ’maid,
and C. Ross Nott was best man. The recep-
tion at the Australia was served with a riot
of bloom and foliage, and seasoned wich
rich frocking, the bride's mother flying a
masterpiece of the dress designer’s art in
black and gold.
Not all her 400 tourists saw Our Harbor
when the fine Cunarder Franconia arrived in
Port Jackson on Saturday morning. A whole
dining-car load of them left the steamer de
luxe at Melbourne and came on overland.
Mostly the Franconia’s passengers are Ameri-
cans, quiet-mannered but alert-eyed behind
their shell-rimmed glasses. The stores car-
ried include (listen, ye sun-parched souls
back o’ Bourke !) of champagne 2800 bottles ;
wines and liqueurs, 4000 bottles; whisky,
4300 bottles ; beer and stout, 35,000 bottles;
lager, 14,000 bottles ; and nearly 5000 gallons
of draught lager. No wonder returned liouse-
wifer Portia Geacli declares prohibition a
great success in America. It’s the greatest
incentive to travel ever invented, and we
all know what a valuable education travel
is. There’s a subdued luxury about the
whole vessel; also a fully-equipped hos-
pital, with two doctors, a dispenser, a matron
and two nurses. The dentist is another
indispensable, and 15,000 toothpicks ought to
see out the voyage. A swimming-pool, beauti-
ful enough for a Persian harem, a gym-
nasium, and a squash-rackets court are other
aids to recreation and digestion on the
35,000-miles cruise.
Perhaps the most interesting of the visitors
the Franconia has brought to these shores
is Lady Pearson, who up to the time of his
death was the eyes and guiding hand of the
baronet-publisher who, blind himself, became
the head of all the movements to alleviate
the lot of the sightless. He was a principal
factor in the work of St. Dunstan’s, London,
that wonder place where the blind are taught
to overcome their difficulties, and, now that
her husband is dead, his widow maintains his
noble work. In Sydney, whilst her ship-
mates were sightseeing, Lady Pearson spent
a great deal of her time at the institution
which is run to help the blind.
Jo O’Keefe is back from six months in
France, Vienna and London, and brings
with her the sartorial thou-shalts and shalt-
nots of the moment. Shoes are beige (never
black), stockings nude, except when allied
to red frocking, when they must be grey.
Fur is always in the picture, and dresses
are short, and tight even on the skin and
bone they pretend to cover. Fat as part
of the human anatomy is no more —the
old story of the lady who dined on one
grape because her lover thought it unses-
thetic for a woman to eat a solid meal is
recalled every day in Paris and London
(the Viennese have had too much of the
real thing to be so keen on starvation as
a fad), where women can be seen lunching
on an ice and a cun of black coffee, and
making a square meal on an undersized cut-
let and a spoonful of spinach. Umbrellas
as city accessories are “out,” taxis being
so cheap and numerous that the lady of
fashion simply takes one from door to door.
Only diamond (?) bracelets are worn in the
evening, and these in great profusion. The
fashion, started last year at Monte Carlo by
a Miss Chapman, of wearing your coat
thrown over the shoulders without putting
the arms into the sleeves, still persists both
by day and evening, some models even being
made with false sleeves. Two Australian
women who are noticeably smart at all Paris
gatherings are Frank Otter’s widow and
Eugenia Doughty, who as Eugenia Stone
once wrote this paper’s Melbourne Chatter.
So rich did her Grimsby knight leave her that
her gold dinner-service is of a sort seldom seen
save in palaces.
This pretty girl is Jean Pollock, who is
keeping up Queensland’s record not only for
good looks but
for musician-
ship in the
M a Sta t e.
Jean’s instru-
ment is the
piano, and her
teacher Frank
Hutchens. The
other day she
lid him proud
by obtaining a
Fellowship of
Trinity Col-
lege, London.
There are only
two other Pel-
lows in N. S.
Wales, and
they are
Frank Hut-
chens him-
self and Iris

Rego. A reci-
tal by the budding Carreno will take place
during the year. May Moore is responsible
for the picture.
At St. John’s Church, Beecroft, last Wed-
nesday, Archdeacon Harris tied the knot that
binds Jean Nossiter, eldest daughter of
the T. B. Nossiters, of Cheltenham, to
M. C. (“Cleve”) Pines, youngest son of
Mrs. E. P. Pines and the late genial P. P.
Pines, one of the original directors of Paling
ana Co. and a well-known figure in Sydney’s
musical circles in the early part of the cen-
tury. The bridegroom is one of the last to
get' married of a batch that left Warren to go
to the war with the 6th TJght Horse. The
couple will live at the Groom’s station, Glen-
more, Collie, near Gilgandra.
One of the most arresting pictures ever
seen on the Conservatorium platform was
furnished by Gladys Verona at
monial concert to Phyllis McDonald. Gladys,
who had known the little violinist in London,
was one of the first to offer her services to
the programme. In rich blue moires flecked
with silver, tight as to bodice and spreading
as to skirt, the slim artist floated _on to the
platform like some Dresden china shep-
herdess, her pink and white complexion and
lint-wliite locks in no way lessening the
effect. Her voice, too, light, high and silvery,
was a charm to the ear. Alfred O Shea s
tenor was never more liquid or more fervent,
and Frank Hutchens’s fingers strayed dream-
ily over the keyboard to the delight of the
crowded house. The quartet from Golden
Grove (Phyllis’s own convent) and a small
violin champion helped the good work of
the evening. Genial George Portus, from
Beale’s, without whose aid the concert could
never have materialised, added a handsome
presence and speech to the proceedings.
The lady in this Monteith picture isn’t a
conjurer, but she can make a cold-storage
egg quail with
a single glance.
She is house-
wife enthusi-
ast Portia
Geach, and
the age and
antecedents of
eggs are to
her an open
book. Her
message to the
world is:
‘T each the
wives of to-
morrow (and
to-day, too)
the dietetic
value of foods,
and there need
not be one
faulty house-
hold budget, or
one hungry
child inAustra-
lia. The thought of the food that is wasted,
particularly by the English-speaking world,
makes Miss Geach nearly moan with distress.
Omar evidently had such as her in mind
when he wrote his panegyric “A loaf of
bread, a jug of wine and thou”; probably
the Persian Portia Geach turned these in-
gredients into an appetising three-course
meal. The Housewives’ Association, of which
Miss Geach has been president and secre-
tary, and to which she is now a sort of tra-
velling godmother, gave her an official wel-
come last week and a social one this week.
The objective of the society is to increase
its roll of members to 25,000, and then it
will have a say in the price of our daily
bread, the breakfast egg and bacon, and the
green vegetables that should be within the
reach of all.
Bradley’s Head added its last week’s quota
towards double housekeeping when Joan
Webster Wedderburn, of that wind-swept
height, exchanged the time-honored formula
with neighbor G.mff. King. The chapel of
“Shore” Grammar was the matrimonial
trysting-place, and a froth of lace was
attended by what at first glance looked like
two pink roses, but turned out to be brides-
maids in a swirl of petalled georgette and
pink tulle hats. The bride’s father later
did his duty in the way of toast supplies at
the Wentworth.
St. Mary's puts in a claim for a word to
be said about Mollie Martin, one of its
prettiest brides of the week. She came from
Brewarrina, and in the conventional froth
of georgette and tulle was married to Dr.
F. R. Coyne, of Bourke. The priest who
united them was Father Collander, surely
an appropriate name for one who gives a
young woman a license to start housekeeping.
The usual custom of placing a wreath on
the mural tablet at Bath to the memory of
Admiral Phillip, first Governor of N.S.W.,
was carried out on the Sunday following Aus-
tralia Day. At the celebration of the day itself
in London, for the service at St. Dunstan’s-
in-the-East, Arthur Mason was at the organ,
and the vocal quartette was composed of
Alice Nayer, Veronica Mansfield, Oswald
Rippon and Richard Watson. Later there
was a reception at the Clotliworkers’ Hall, at
which the band of the Grenadier Guards
played, with additional music by Elsie Tre-
week. Mignon Trevor, Phyllis McDonald,
Fred Collier and Budden Morris. Arthur
Mason has a busy time, for, apart from his
work as editor of the journal of the music
trades, he writes a weekly article on musical
affairs which is syndicated throughout the
provinces. And there are his public per-
formances. as well as his regular contribu-
tions to Australian newspapers.
The 22nd of this month is set aside by
Burdekin House enthusiasts for a party to
the glory of Mrs. .T. A. Wilson. The hostesses
for the afternoon are Mrs. Sidney Mack,
wife of the K.C., Mrs. .T. C. Williamson
and Mrs. Trefle. Singing-girl Nora Mack
is arranging the musical programme that will
link tile speeches and crumpets of the after-
noon with sweet sounds.
The orchestral matinees for school-kiddies
which proved so popular last year are to
be continued during the present year; the
first concert will start at 2.30 in the ’Con.
next Saturday. The programme is a ming-
ling of Weber, Beethoven, Humperdinck and
other works within the understanding of
boys and girls. The charge for these con-
certs is nominal, one shilling for each
reserved seat.
Sheaves or wheat, so the report runs, pro-
fusely decorated St. Thomas’s Church in
North Sydney when a pretty bride arrived
for her wedding the other Saturday. Still
another within the maze, as it were.
Of immense interest to mothers and im-
portance to babies on the north side of the
harbor is the opening of the Mothercrafc
Training Home at Willoughby. The town
house of the late H. 11. Hankins has been
acquired by the Royal Welfare Society,
and the old home in Second-avenue, Wil-
loughby, surrounded by spreading lawns and
garden, will be known as Tresillian North.
Dr. Margaret Harper, medical director of
the original Tressilian, will be the director
of the new establishment also; and Miss
Norman, who was senior sister at Tresil-
lian, has been appointed matron of the new
baby culture centre. Tresillian North will
be opened on March 23, by the Minister of
Public Health, who, by the way, is now
known as Cann-opener.
The ranks of the pioneers of the feminist
movement in Australia, now worn very thin
by time, have been further depleted by the
death of Mrs. S. S. Nolan. Her real objective
in life was to do hurt to the demon der-rink;
she wanted women to have a vote because
she thought it could only be exercised to that
end. She was State president of the
Women’s Christian Temperance Union in
N.S.W. from 1893 to 1907, for another five
years its Federal president, and represented
the union at the World Congress in Glasgow
in 1910; she was also a founder of the
National Council of Women, and of the Dal-
mar Children’s Home at Carlingford.
Miss Brisbane’s chronicles:—
Wedding bells rang in St. Alban’s Chapel at the
Southport High School for Lorimer Dods and Mar-
garet Walsh. Dr. Dods is the only son of the late
Robin Dods and of Mrs. Dods, EdgeclifF, Sydney,
and the bride is the second daughter of the
Walshes, of Warraby, Southport. The bride whispered
“I do” in cream mariette and silver guipure, with
a Limerick-lace veil that had been worn by her
grandmother. Her train -was of Limerick lace, and
she wore a chaplet of orange blossoms. The train,
which was lent by Mrs. Willie Persse, was lined with
pale pink. A shower bouquet of pink roses and
cactus-dahlias was carried. Eileen Walsh and Mary
Macgregor ’maided in cream mariette with filmy
lace over rainbow-hued panels. Picture hats of
hydrangea blue were worn, and both maids carried
bunches of blue hydrangeas. Warraby saw the
reception in a decoration of pink blossomrv and
sprays of green. Mrs. Walsh wore mastic mariette.
her crin. hat being trimmed with roses in rosewood
shades. The bridegroom’s mother wore black
mariette and a black crin. hat, and she carried mauve
asters and heliotrope.
On the same evening, in the Wharf-street kirk.
Brisbane, Dr. Norman Sherwood, of Sydney, married
Dorothy Cribb, who wore ivory satin with an over-
dress of Brussels lace caught with trails of orange
and peach blossom. The tulle wedding veil had a
wreath of orange blossom, and the bride’s bouquet
was of pink rosebuds. Anne Cribb, in delphinium
blue, and Lucy Cribb, in rose taffetas, were the
’maids. There was a reception at the National roof-
garden.
Muriel Starr had a big house for the opening night
of “A House of Glass,” and after the play was over
Barbara Sisley arranged a supper party at her
studio for the actress, the George Brookes and some
of the company. The season finished with “French
Leave,” and “No, No, Nanette” takes the floor foi
a fairly long spin.
The A. D. Walshes are off to England by the
Euripides, and Captain Arnold Weinholt also leaves
us for the Cape and for big game hunting in
darkest, or very nearly darkest, Africa.
The Brisbane United Home Leaguers gave a wel-
come to Mrs. Commissioner Sowden in the Ann-street
Salvation Army' Temple. Mrs. Suttor presided. Mrs.
Jolly, Mayoress of Brisbane, Freda Bage and Mrs.
Cumbrae Stewart were also on the platform. Freda
Bage spoke on the work of the League of Nations,
and Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart mentioned Mrs. Sow-
den’s interest in the National Council of Women
in Canada.
On the same evening E. Griffith Oxley presided over
the yearly' meeting of the Alliance Francaise, held in
the Hall of the Muses. Hon-sec. O’Sullivan said
the membership was now 78. The Comte de Tournouer
gave an address on French racial geography, and
was re-elected president.
Brisbane now has a women’s bridge club, which
holds its meetings on Fridays at Vaughan’s Cafe.
Pink gerberas and gumtips backgrounded the fir>t
party, and Mrs. Colin Campbell was elected presi-
dent, with Mrs. W. H. Cusworth as hon. sec. and
treasurer. ,
The Y.W.C.A. have had a banquet in the cluo
rooms at Adelaide-street. Some 150 were present, and
Mrs. T. Stewart presided. Miss E. S. Reed (the ne"
sec.) was welcomed, and, in the concert hall aftei-
wards Rhoda Frigate said more nice things on the
girls’ behalf, and there was music.

ome
is complete now
HOME has always been dear to us, but we were
forced to admit that something was lacking—
that evenings, particularly, were rather dull—
even depressing at times.
It took us years to find it out, but now we know
that the “something lacking” was brightness, and since
Delco-Light has supplied that need, we all agree that
“Home IS complete now.”
Home has really been transformed: reading, sew-
ing and games in the soft, yet brilliant, electric light
are much more enjoyable, and entertaining is no longer
an effort. An electric vacuum cleaner, electric iron
and washing-machine have added hours to our leisure,
and fans make the hottest days bearable.
But perhaps the greatest boon made possible by
Delco-Light is FRIGIDAIRE. It preserves our foods,
provides cold drinks which are a joy, and ice cream
and frozen dainties which are a sheer delight.
In addition to being simple, dependable, economi-
cal, the plant is as inexpensive as a quality product
can be.

Patrons of flic V.R.C. absolutely sweltered
on the first two days of the meeting. There
seemed no clothes cool enough for Australian
Cup day, and no liquid sufficiently cold to
give relief to the thirsty. Just to show the
grumblers that heat isn’t the only unpleasant
condition, race-goers were well-nigh frozen
oil Saturday. The wind was keen enough
to penetrate the coats and furs of the winter
clad, and the gee-gees in their stalls were
all a-shiver. A perfect beast of a day, not
improved by a shower of rain and the
defeat of most of the favorites. Lots of
nice tailored costumes, mostly made with
double-breasted short coats, were seen, though
the jumper suit, which is a long way from
extinction, was well represented. Fur-col-
lared top-coats covered several gowns, the
two vice-regal ladies being thus attired.
Lady Stonehaven wore brown and golden-
toncd velvet with her putty-colored hat, and
Lady Somers had a big tweed coat in a block
pattern of black, green and grey over her
apple-green frock. The G.-G. and the State
Governor were in evidence, and both couples
lunched various guests. In the G.-G.’s circle
were Dame Margaret Greville, who favored
a soft pink coat, collared with snow leopard,
with pink anemones dangling from her rose-
pink hat, and Surgeon-Commander Graham
Brown and his wife. The Somers pair gath-
ered around them several country visitors.
Society went to the polo finals at Moouee
Falley on Friday, and took tea with the
Governor and Lady Somers. His Ex., who
played with the Moonee Valley team, was
one of the victors in the beaten teams’ com-
petition, the Stradbroke Cup going to the
South Riverina representatives captained by
C. Skene. It was one of the pleasantest days
of the week, and some quite nice frocks were
sported. Lady Somers hostessed in a fawn
lace frock glimpsed beneath a coat of maroon
velour cloth, and her large hat, with lace
bow, was of the hue of her gown. The G.-G.
and the Stonehaven lady were guests, her
Ex. topping a navy-blue and floral gown
with a coral-pink hat. The Margaret
Greville dame, Harry and Lady Chauvel,
the Clarke lady, the Harry Creswick couple,
some Fairbairns and many others took
part in the tea-drinking.
A packed house at the Auditorium paid
tribute to Melba’s voice and eternally youth
ful appearance. The Dame’s soft pink
chiffon frock, with its tunic in apron mode,
headed with sash effect of powder-blue, had
many real twinklers about the corsage of
diamente, and gems of purest ray serene
sparkled in her tiara. Five attendants were
required to bear the flowers to the stage.
A vice-regal party flanked the stalls. Lady
Stonehaven had a wrap of silver, tissue over
a olack gown, and Lady Somers, who accom-
panied the State Governor, wore a • soft
white dress with cape of Madonna blue,
almost monastic in effect. Dame Margaret
Greville figured in. the v.-r. group in tones
of Farma violet and mauve, and Misses
Chamberlain and Gillett and sundry aides
and secretaries filled the background. A par-
ticularly hot, close night brought out fans of
uivers patterns. Lady Miller, whose black
gown glistened, defied the fates with pea-
cocks’ plumes. Of the Franconians who
attended the concert, Lady Pearson was the
outstanding figure. A cloth-of-silver gown
blended beautifully with shingled hair turn-
ing white, and set off a slim, elegant figure
and good features. Ella Guthrie, Mrs.
Fitz Hart and her son Basil, the Jimmy
Dyer couple, the Norton Grimwades, Mrs.
Herbert Power and Mrs. MacDevitt joined
in the welcome to the diva, and approved
of her latest find, the nice Highland laddie,
Stuart Robertson, whose enunciation was a
joy. The always popular John Lemmone
and accompanist Bindley Evans basked in
the radiance also.
A crush of femininity at Scott’s, in which
a handful of men was utterly submerged,
and a clatter of tongues and teacups gave
evidence the other day that a social after-
noon of the E.S.U. was in progress. The
kettle-boiling was in honor of Melba’s return.
The diva wore a jumper blouse of navy georg-
ette, patterned with poppies and daisies, with
a skirt and cape of navy also, accordeon
pleated. Her millinery was velvet of the
same shade. Mrs. Mackinnon' handed over
a posy of pink carnations, and husband
Donald murmured pleasant things. Dame
Melba, who was somewhat upset by the
death of her old friend Alberto Zelman,
begged to be excused from talking at length,
merely referring to the loss the musical world
of Melbourne had suffered, and thanking the
E.S.U. for the party. American Consul-
General Garrels and Renee Kelly spoke
words of welcome, though Miss Kelly had
to admit that she had never heard the guest
of honor sing. Melba promised her a song
all to herself.
A curtain-raiser to the three days' fair
at Queen Victoria Hospital was a
cabaret show at the Embassy. The atmo-
sphere was Turkish-batliy, but young folk
in scores jazzed indefatigably and enjoyed
the efforts of artists from the Tivoli and
other theatres. The Sam McCaughey
matron, in black; Biddy Tallis, with pearl
and crystal embellishment upon a pale
amber frock; and Dorothy Brooke, wearing
cobalt blue that glistened, engineered the
gathering. Other kindly folk sold balloons,
favors and extra things to eat and drink.
Mrs. Gilruth, a vice-president of the Q.V.H.,
whose reseda-green gown bore dull gold
and steel tracery, was a vendor, and Mrs.
J. S. Winter, in black, was another. Presi-
dent Mrs. Norman Brookes was sheathed in
a patterning of wee silver sequins and pearls,
and Mayoress Morrell was a harmony of
soft grey and steel embroidery. The Tallis
lady had a sprinkle of sparkles on lemon-
hued raiment. The younger set also gleamed
and shone.
The Stonehaven lady deserted the races
to launch the three-days’ Pair in the grounds
of Queen Victoria Hospital. Her Ex. did
the rounds of the tan, escorted by Mrs.
Norman,Brookes, and her little opening speech
didn’t take long. Helpers came from all
parts of the city and suburbs, and the class-
war was forgotten while all worked happily
together for the cause. The Mayoress, Mrs.
Morell, and Mrs. W. M. Robins went into
the flower and fruit business for the occa-
sion, their wares being arranged in attrac-
tive wicker baskets. Mrs. Gilruth and a
bevy of assistants ran an ice-cream stall.
The Tallis lady went into the old-clothes
trade, and found buyers for a weird array of
cast-offs. Melbourne Uni. students and some
others put on musical programmes twice a
day. The goal is £20,000, urgently required
for the hospital run by women for women.
Mrs. Claude Couchman, here pictured by
Lafayette, is the new president of the
Women’s Na-
tional League,
whose mission
is purely poli-
tical, and she
takes up her
duties in the
thick of a
State election.
The lady has
held office in
the league for
nine years, has
a good grasp
of the politi-
cal situation,
and is a splen-
di d speaker.
In her under-
grad. days at
Perth Uni. she
studied econo-
mics and poli-
tical science.
She was then
one of the two women members of the Public
Educational Council, and later interested her-
self in child-welfare work. She is the wife
of an officer of the Public Works Depart-
ment, well known as a cricketer; he is a
son of the late Lieut,-Col. Couchman, who
was once head of the Public Service Depart-
ment The league, which has a membership
of over 50,000, celebrates its 23rd birthday
to-day.
It was a strange audience that poured
into the Theatre Royal on Saturday night
to see Australia’s one-time stage idol, Nellie
Stewart, after years of retirement. There
were boys and girls who saw Sweet Nell for
the first time; folk a little older who com-
menced their theatre-going when the actress
was nearing the end of her stage career, and
a whole horde of the grey-headed and bald-
headed who had followed her through pan-
tomime, comic opera, modern comedy and
drama and Shakspearean plays, and who,
finding their favorite as charming and viva-
cious as of yore, renewed their youth. She
was greeted with a storm of shouts, coo-ees,
stampings and hand-clapping that held up
the play, and the tumult welled up at inter-
vals, ever louder, until the final curtain,
when the leading lady, nursing a big Lend
doll and some posies, tearfully gave thanks.
The dressing was as elaborate as ever.
Nell Gwynne’s immense white-plumed hat
topped fur-edged draperies of rose velvet,
and in another scene she tripped it in the
daintiest of pink buckled shoes, with silver-
embroidered hose that peeped beneath a
petticoat of pink and blue jewel-sprinkled
brocade, her fair coiffure being adorned with
turquoise blue combs. The wedding-gown of
Lady Olivia Vernon (Roslyn Vane) was a
poem in white, heavily embossed with silver.
The Robinson lady, Mrs. Percy Deane and
lier sister, Mrs. Ellis, of Calcutta, who is
on one of her periodical visits home, Miss
Maude Burdett (England), General Monash,
Miss Bentwitcli, and Benno Scherek were
noticed in the audience.
The first of her sex to go through the full
University course in agriculture, including
a year on the
land at the
Werribee State
Farm, is Aud-
rey Osborne,
whose dad lec-
tures on phy-
siology at the
local shop, and
whose mother,
Dr. Ethel
Osborne, sports
a brass-
plate in Col-
lins-street. At
Merton College
Miss Osborne
won a free
studentship at
chi' University,
and proceeded
to learn all
about far m-
ing. Werribee
was not arran-
ged to accommodate girl students, so she
hoarded near the college, doing hours a
day at dairying, ploughing and the like,
interspersed with lectures and demonstra-
tions. She has not yet made up her mind
when she will start real farming, but pro-
bably she will find employment on the pro-
perty at Kangaroo Grounds, near Eltham,
owned by her parents. Her brother is doing
the agri. course at the Uni. also. The pic-
ture is by Lafayette.
Folk who spent a week-end at Canberra
recently report that one must not expect
any attention or courtesy from the autho-
rities on a Saturday. Everybody downs
tools at 12 o’clock, and most of the present
population goes to Queanbeyan, nine miles
away, to quench the accumulated thirst of
the week. Though a few weeks have yet
to pass before Bertie, Duke of York, lines
up Senators and gentlemen of the House
of Reps., the place is already getting tangled
up in red tape. A party of citizens that
visited the capital lately, and secured a
special permit to view Government House,
discovered that though they had a permit
someone else had the key. The sight of
these respectable folk instructing the care-
taker in the art of pushing back window-
bolts with a penknife and picking locks
with a bent nail w T as highly diverting.
A tour through Parliament House brought
more disappointments. The visitors were
hustled along corridors and allowed furtive
peeps into the legislative chambers to see
dreary rows of covered-up benches. The
seats are built wide enough to seat two only,
evidently to prevent members using the place
as a dormitory. However, the famous Speak-
er’s chair, by some oversight, was not
shrouded, and the portraits of former Gov-
ernors-General and Prime Ministers were
on exhibition. George Rex’s statue was
wrapped in swaddling-clothes. The table
jettisoned from the timbers of H.M.A.S.
Australia, the library, the sleeping apart-
ments and suites of the four heads, and
the bar, rumored to be the biggest in the
Commonwealth, were not on view. The
visitors were told they mustn’t use cameras,
but there was no temptation. The only
really interesting thing about the whole
turnout was the guide, who refused a tip.
Parliament House looms dazzlingly in the
sunlight over the settlements of small cot-
tages and bungalows which promise a town
possessing more than the usual number of
social cliques. The grading is quite appa-
rent to even the novice; it’s a matter of
architecture. In the Hotel Canberra the
town-planners have done themselves proud.
There are a tennis-court, a bowling-green,
golf-links and beautiful gardens. The other
hostels are comfortable enough lodging-
houses, but not so well set. Perhaps some
day, when trees grow over the cheerless
waste, and the winds cease to scatter dust
over the country upon which the capital
is muddlingly raising itself, the prospect
of the compulsory exiles who are to live there
may appear more promising.
The Cooks’ tourists de luxe who are see-
ing as much as it is possible to glimpse ot
the earth in months will get a better
idea of Australia than did their forerunners
of the Carinthia. So far as this State is
concerned the Franconians were scheduled to
spend more time in the bush than will the
Royal visitors. The Franconia, though
hardly so ornate in some respects as the
Carinthia, has the same luxurious atmo-
sphere. There is a splendid marble swim-
ming pool, gymnasium and squash racquets
court, and on deck a glassed-in palm-court.
The Victorian division of the A.R.C.S.,
through its secretary, Philadelphia N. Robert-
son, has sent out an SOS to knitters for pull-
overs for invalid soldiers. A similar appeal
last year produced 300 garments. This time
the request is for 700 sweaters. Wool coun-
ters in any of the city. shops . and the Red
Cross Society, 44 Latrobe-street, will give
plans and specifications to anyone interested.
Knitters kind-hearted enough to remember
the men who remembered their country’s need
should send their offerings as soon as possible
to the R.C.S. or the Red Cross Handicrafts
Shop, Queen’s-walk.
Melbourne rejoices in a glad-rag shop of a
new kind. It is a sort of entente cordialc
affair, since the confections of M. Pierre
Fornari, the proprietor, are made by Aussie
fingers. The showroom is the replica
of a Versailles reception-room, and the
walls are white and gold with panels of
old-rose brocade. The furniture is of the
gilt and tapestried order. All wares are
hidden away in cupboards and presses, and
mannequins slip on whatever one wishes to
see. Each costume, gown, wrap or fur has
its own name. There will be, say, a coat
known as “Do You Like It?” or an evening
gown that rejoices in the title, of “L'Heure
Exquise”-—labels that titillate one’s interest
before the garment is displayed. The venture
is meeting with a lot of success.
Lady Pearson visited our Lady Helen
Club for Blind Soldiers as soon as the
Franconia arrived. She had a warm greet-
ing, not only from the men, but from their
womenfolk and children as well. She is
making it her particular business during her
travels to get in touch with as many ex-
Dunstan’s men as she possibly can. Accom-
panying the lady on her tour is her niece,
Avril Stevenson, a smart miss, whose triin
attire of masculine cut, Eton crop and
cigarette in a mammoth holder made Mel-
bourne open both eyes wide.
A link was forged between two New
South Wales pasturages at Toorak kirk the
other evening, when Sheila May, a daugh-
ter of the Alec Stevenson couple, of Woo-
rooma, Deniliquin, took a ring from Maine
Outhwaite, of Milby, Condobolin, who is
the only son of the E. W. Outhwaites, of
Toorak. The bride’s white georgette gown
nad a glimmer of pink beneath, and much
white tulle, forming veil and train, floated
from a glistening Juliet cap. The two brides-
maids’ frocks, in shades of pink, harmonised
with the decorations. Many country folk
from the neighbor State joined in the jollifi-
cations at No. 9.
Sir Ernest Harvey has been unpacking
a lot of nice remarks about us in the
moments he has to spare from financial con-
sultations. He says that when he accepted
the Commonwealth Bank’s invitation to come
over and advise about banking affairs, he
hesitated over the language difficulty, having
heard that we had evolved a dialect of our
own. A handbook on the subject was not
procurable, so he had to trust to luck. Now
he finds we are easier to understand than
many of the English, and altogether has
experienced a pleasant surprise.
Sister Adelaide discourses: —
There is a vogue for evening weddings at the
moment, and the Taylor-Tolley wedding (he the son
of the W. D. Taylors, of North Adelaide, and she
the Ernest Tolley daughter) followed the fashion. The
wedding dress was tulle and chiffon —plain as to
bodice, outstanding as to skirt-—with a gleam of
silver lace at the hem, and the five green-clad brides-
maids were Joan Cutten, Jean Taylor, Evelyn Scarfe,
Gwen Hall and Gwen Verco. Mrs. Tolley hostessed
the toast-drinking at the Taylors’ house (she is
just back from Europe), and after the bride and
bridegroom had been waved on their way to Sydney
the younger guests migrated to the Palais and finished
the evening there.
The Chitral’s passengers included the Dudley Hay-
wards, the Roy Davidsons and their children, the
Gordon McFarlanes, C. J. B. Symon and the Bishop
and Mrs. Thomas and their daughters. Clive Carey
was also a passenger. The Conservatorium vacation
allowed him only four weeks in London, but he
made the most of it. Folk-singing and dancing—
he is the patron saint of such lore here —he found
in full swing, and among the South Australians of
whom he brings news are Richard Watson, Helene
Taylor and Charlotte Grivell, all doing good work.
April’s outward bookings include the Frank Irwins,
the A. J. Walkleys, the Alfred Wells and their
daughter, and the John Dunbars.
The engagement is announced of Lorna, youngest
daughter of the W. R. Bavleys, of. Prince Alfred
College, to Dr. H. C. Hosking, of New Guinea.
The Society of Arts declared itself open for the
year at a social whereof the honors were done by
president White. There is a healthy list of book-
ings of the society’s rooms (including a show by
the United Arts Club and- another' by the Royal
Colonial Society of Artists), and among the prizes
to be competed for are two of 20 guineas for sea
and landscape, and another, donated by Mr. Alec
Melrose, of 25 guineas for figure, work.
Miss Lilias Hawker and Miss Rosemary Cudmore
have returned from their trip to Java.
There is sorrow in the hearts of the older genera-
tion at the passing of Dr. Symons. Once one of the
best-known medical men here, he lived for some
years in England, and returned only a few years ago.
And from Africa comes news of the death of
Mrs. G. H. Turner, eldest daughter of the late
Samuel Tomkinson, well known here a generation
ago when her father’s was one of the most hospitable
homes in the State. Her marriage dated back
to the days when an English regiment was stationed
here; her husband was a major in the 50th Foot.

brings
from
disastrous fires
For many years fire appliances capable
of dealing with fires of an ordinary nature,
such as might occur in offices, have been
in general use, but the widespread in-
troduction of petrol and fuel oil saw the
advent of a fire risk demanding a new
extinguishing medium which would, in
addition, be adequate for dealing with
fires involving inflammable liquids. After
lengthy research, the last decade saw the
introduction of the FOAMIXE method
of Fire Protection with portable equip-
ment and fixed installations producing a
fire extinguishing medium (Firefoam)
which met this demand.
Fiercely blazing petrol, paint, tar —
which defy other extinguishing methods
-—are easily smothered under Firefoam.
Ordinary fires die instantly. The foam
not only puts out the fire but prevents re-
ignition.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Although Valicare beat Top Gallant and
Fuji San brilliantly in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes, the
hero of the V.R.C. Autumn meeting was unquestion-
ably Spearfelt. After his victory in the Australian
Cup with tlie record weight of 9st. 131 b., and in the
record time of 3min. 51jsec., Spearfelt avenged his
A.J.C. Derby defeat on Heroic in the Governor’s
Plate, 12 furlongs. Ridden by lvnevitt, he led all
the way and won by 21 lengths in 2min. 35-[sec.
On that form the gallant descendant of Carbine
looked a certainty for the King’s Plate, 2 miles, on
the last day, but, his leg giving trouble again, he
was scratched, and Heroic had for opponents only
Naos, Three Kings and Miss Disraeli. Strangely
enough, although Heroic had given Kaos 2st. 71b. in
the Sydney Cup and finished within a head of him,
McShortodds offered to take 6 to 4 about Kollow’s
chestnut, who was meeting Naos (a good little horse,
but not in the Heroic class) at lev el weights. Kellow
and his crowd helped themselves, and at the finish
Heroic was 7 to 4 on, with Naos 2 to 1 against,
his stable companion Three Kings 25 to 1, and Miss
Disraeli 100 to 1. Naturally, the conqueror of
IVjndbag in the A.J.C. Cumberland Stakes was too
good for Naos; he took command in the straight and
won easily by 2-J lengths ; the time was 3min. 29isec.
All going well with him, Heroic should make the
w.f.a. races at Randwick at Easter time as interest-
ing as he did last year.
For the Leonard Stakes, run over the Newmarket
course, there was a good-quality field of 17 starters,
and the betting was very wide. At the close of
operations Biskra and Chrystal were equal at 11 to
2, with Metellus and Baringbup 6. to 1, Preposterer
8 to 1, tea Pi'incess 10 to 1, Coogee Bay 12 to 1,
and Postscript 15 to 1. Soon after the start Post-
script took charge, with Chrystal, who hung out
rather badly, Yea Princess and Metellus nearest of
the others. Galloping like a good one, Postscript
had a clear lead at the distance, and finished with
an advantage of 2j? lengths; Lady Thrill (25 to 1)
was second and Chrystal 1A lengths behind her, with
Ihskra fourth. A four-year-old S. Aus. mare by
Gyklon—Xena Bell, Postscript was ridden by “Tich”
' who has been out of the limelight lately,
and is trained by E. J. Hatwell for H. P. McLachlan.
•he covered the six in the smart time of lmin.
filsec., and she should be heard of again.
Consistent Trivalve, who had been placed in both
the Sires’ Produce and Ascot Vale Stakes, took the
Gibson Carmichael Stakes at 7 to 1 ; Jimmy Wil-
nTi P " lkami GO to 1) and the favorite Sacedon
y to 1), who weakened over the last bit, were in
the minor places. The winner, who finished really
ls a chestnut eolt by Cyklon—Trey, and is
Pained by Jim Scobie for Ernest Clarke. Veteran
ob Lewis was on top, and the seven furlongs were
tett behind in lmin. 27sec. —not bad going for
a two-year-old with 9st. 3lb.
Dempsey’s mount, the rather unlucky Corncrake,
was always favorite (5 to 2 at barrier-rise) for the
fiorthcote Handicap, 12 furlongs, Smoke Bomb (1
• Dnitator (9 to 2) and Elarby (5 to 1) being
iext m demand. Taking charge below the distance,
mitator came home well to win hv 21 lengths
10m Corncrake, with Smoke Bomb, who is proving
n expensive horse to Holt’s followers, a head away
*nd imported Nico a good fourth. Tmitator is a
_-year-old mare hv Magpie—Flay and races in book-
er? 1, Wally Mitchell’s colors ; V. O’Neill trains her.
vith only fist. 91b. on her back, she ran the 12
tnrlongs in 2min. 34£sec. She has 7st. 21b. in the
-Sydney Cup.
Despite his 9st. lllb., Gothic, the Newmarket
pinner, was a 3-to-l favorite for the Farewell Handi
U ,P' but Horoscope (7 to 1) was too good at the
«g>ts. At the judge’s box Horoscope was three-
luarters of a length ahead of Cyden (10 to 1), who
created Gothic by a length; Comus and Preposterer,
.Whether, followed. Horoscope, who is by Absurd—
-4 - Ball, is a smart horse and will run a good
mile in the Doncaster if Elwood Fisher takes him to
Bandwick.
Just as Spearfelt was the best old horse at the
meeting, so was Royal Feast easily the pick of the
youngsters. His Sires’ Produce and Ascot Vale Stakes
wins were capital performances, and his owner, W. E. J.
Craig, has reason to look hopefully to his three-
year-old prospects. Of course, he may not stay
the Derby distance, but he. shapes more like a
stayer than anything else seen out this season, with
the possible exception of Belgamba’s brother Glcn-
ariff.
* * * *
But one 10-stoner (Marvel, in 1892) has
ever won the Doncaster Handicap, and nine-stoners
have succeeded only six times in 56 years. Never-
theless, the A.J.C. framer of weights began his
handicap with Manfred, 10st. 21b., giving Heroic
10st., Top Gallant 9st. 131 b., Amounis 9st. 121 b.,
Waranton and Fuji San 9st. 111 b., Gothic 9st. 81b.,
Quintus 9st. 71b. and Metellus 9st. 51b. It would be
long odds against any of that lot on a wet day, and
a wet day is quite a possibility on April 16.
Boaster, if he can stand a preparation, looks much
more attractive at Bst. 131 b., and so does Vaals
with Bst. 121 b. Others who take the eye are Hemi-
sphere and Horoscope (Bst. 31b.), Grecian .Orator
(Sst. 21b.), Bravado (Bst.), Don Moon (7st. 121 b.),
New Hope (7st. 71b.) and Crystallised Glass (7st.
71b.). Perhaps Vaals and Grecian Orator are the
picks of the handicap. The latter won the Carrington
Stakes like a really good horse, and he has shown
that he doesn’t care whether the going is hard or
soft or betwixt and between.
Spearfelt heads the Sydney Cup list with lOst.
41b. ; Windbag has 21b., Manfred 31b., Heroic 51b.
and Pantheon 71b. less. They are tremendous
weights. Bacchus and Naos (each Bst.) are more
enticing, as also is Piastoon (7st. 121 b.), and Octem-
ber (7st. 51b.) may succeed where October’s other
son, Bitalli, failed. Vaals and Octember or Grecian
Orator and one of Kelso’s may be worth specking in
doubles. Again, they may not.
* * * *
The racing at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.)
on Saturday, though voted flat and unprofitable by
the punting brotherhood, provided an eventful chapter
in the life of the jockey called “Togo” Johnstone.
Johnstone’s slatherum-whack methods suit horses that
are inclined to be roguish, and in the first division
of the Flying Handicap, which was the third event
on the programme, he guided the uncertain Kaiwarra
(20 to 'l) to victory, from Prairie Belle (3 to 1) and
Giggle (11 to 2), Highland, a 7-to-4 favorite, shaping
HER CREDENTIALS.
DAD ( jocosely ): “Coin t' enter ’er fr the Districk ’Ack race?”
D AN: “My outh! W’y, the last bloke ’oo ’ad this mare lived next door to the owner
o’ Windbag.”
badly. In the next race, a Maiden Welter, “Togo”
had the mount on Master Redfern (12 to 1), who
threw him at the barrier as they were lining up.
Returning to the saddle, Johnstone drove the refractory
brute to the front and made him stay there until
the judge reached for his number. Then came the
second division of the Flying Handicap, in which
Johnstone w-as engaged to ride Hazel Boy (6 to 1), a
five-year-old gelded son of Honey Bee, who has been
racing at “the ponies.” Again the Johnstone steed
hit the front early and remained in that position,
Woodville (who beat Honey Bee in the 1921 Hawkes-
bury Guineas) and Cajole, an early winner at seven
furlongs or a mile, vainly pursuing him. In the
Bankstown Handicap, the last race, “Togo" got an
unexpected ride on Mando instead of Ellis, who had
been pitched off near the machine and knocked about
a bit. When they had gone a few furlongs Mando
■same down, and several horses appeared to fall
foul of the rider, who rolled over and over; but
the tough fellow got up and walked back, grinning,
to the enclosure, where the crowd cheered him. There
were no Doncaster Handicap or Sydney Cup possi-
bilities among the moderates engaged.

“Mars”: The S. A.J.C. has appointed S.
W. Ferry, one of the three stipendiary stewards, to
take ehai'ge of its school for apprentices, the first
thing of its kind in Australasia, if not the world.
The curriculum will include weekly lectures on all
subjects touching 1 on the calling of a jockey, in
addition to practical lessons in riding, for which
purpose the instructor will visit Morphettville and
Victoria Park once a week during track work. Ferry
is singularly competent to instruct the lads, for,
starting at 10 years, he had a long and honorable
career as a jockey. He rode winners of most of the
important races in S. Aus., both on the flat and over
the fences.
“Ike Mcßagg” : In spite of the profession’s
notorious consideration for the punting public,
English bookmakers are still getting a rough spin
from the betting tax. The usual traitors in the
camp have risen, in the shape of “advertising”
bookmakers; these are as worms in the sight of the
elite “who deal with owners and trainers and the
big professionals,” to quote their protest. The
advertising minions have offered to pay the whole of
the tax on individual wagers, instead of making
the punter carry a big proportion of it, as has
been the equitable custom. This low-class means of
attracting business has been spumed by the aristo-
crats of the ring as “impossible, if the public is to
be treated honestly.” There is a warning to both
sides in a recent Times article on the success of the
tote in Maoriland, where the bookmaker is, ostensibly,
one with Nineveh and Tyre. On a population basis,
the Times reckons a compulsory tote would turn
over £26,000,000 annually in England and Wales
alone, with appropriate taxation results, and Winston
Churchill is sternly asked what he is waiting for
now.

Having run short of 20-round pugs for the
time being, Sydney Stadium staged a couple of 15-
rounders on Saturday night. The star turn was
cut short by the great superiority of Norman Radford
(9st. lib.) to Joe Esler (Bst. 1341 b.). Esler was a
punching-bag- for the Yorkshireman, and referee
Wallis applied the gag in the seventh. The other
item was between Jimmy Taylor, of Melbourne, and
Jack Bowden (colored), 9st. each; it was a desperate
scrap, and the margin in the Victorian’s favor was
not wide, but he clearly won. In an additional bout
Jack Dunleavv’s pupil, .Jerry Reilly—he who was
so amazingly knocked out by hairy Bill Grogan the
previous Saturday—and Les Johnson, a tough, hard-
hitting Swede, provided some thrills. Reilly is an
absolute novice, but Nature has well endowed him,
and he had the more experienced Johnson on the
canvas several times. Johnson returned the com-
pliment, and Wallis made it a draw. It is years
since Australia produced a first-class heavyweight,
but Reilly is the makings of a good one, the Grogan
defeat notwithstanding.

Boxing of a high order was seen at Mel-
bourne Stadium when Norm. Gillespie (Bst. B|lb.)
shaped up to Billy McAllister (Bst. sjib.). Although
Billy was required to walk only one way between
his dressing-room and the ring, he made a merry
little scrap of it while he retained the perpendicular.
Every round was punctuated by brilliant rallies,
and the pace did not slacken until the 12th, when
the effect of Norman's light-cross was reflected in
the ominous sagging of Billy’s knees. The next saw
him down and out. Gillespie finished the job with
the coolness of a veteran, and a lucrative future
should await this young Melbourne pug. if the 20-
round business doesn't sap his vitality.

Before rain caused a postponement of the
proceedings some good performances were put up in
races for N.S.W.A.A. titles at Manly. A new- State
champion came to light in J. Carlton, the GPS
crack, who won the 100yds. in 10 l-ssec. from A
Walker (Manly) and W. Hunt (East Sydney). Carl-
ton has filled out a lot since last year, and as he is
still capable of improvement he should be a worthy
successor to ‘‘Slip” Carr. In the mile, C. R. Mac-
donald (Western Suburbs) won well in 4min. 32
4-ssec.; _ and George Parker (Manly) had an easy
victory in the 3-mile walk in 22min. 20 l-ssec. In
the high jump C. D. Spicer (Kensington) and C. M.
Ebert (Botany) dead-heated at sft. 71in., and failed
at sft. 9m. ; Spicer won the j'ump-off. G. Lewis, a
Queenslander, took the 161 b. shot with 42ft. sJin.
15 3 in. better than last year’s effort; and W. P.
Payne’s (Western Suburbs) heave of the javelin
(159 ft. 2in.) was a long way superior to the attempts
of the other competitors. The Western Suburbs team
is leading for the Refebee shield.
* * * *
“Full Choke”: A bill designed to suppress
pigeon-shooting (or so it is alleged) has been pre-
pared by the N.S.W. Lang Government. I don’t sup-
pose it will go through, but N.S.W. sport would
be a lot sweeter if it did. Whatever it may have
been in the beginning, pigeon-shooting, like pony-
racing and trotting, has become nothing but a medium
for betting. It isn’t a fair go, either, for if the
bird isn’t “stopped” within the boundary the gun is
penalised. The bird suffers whether he falls inside
the fence or dies in No Man’s Land. “Betting on
the barrel” is one of the biggest ramps in wagering
practice. With gun and layers acting in accord on
the question of whether a kill will be made with
first or second barrel, mugs can be skinned as easily
as rabbits. No pigeon club known to me attempts to
discourage the gambling element, without which none
of them would live. Cock-fighting, which the birds
genuinely approved of themselves, was abolished many
years ago. That the massacre of unwilling - pigeons
tor gambling purposes should have been permitted
to continue for so long is a loathsome anachronism.
* * * *
Twenty-four hours’ track performances
constitute a very searching test of car stamina, and
records. of this sort have more engineering value
than is accredited to shorter bursts of speed.
Maroubra (N.S.W.) has been the scene of four such
attempts since it was built, and the other day the record
was broken by a V.auxhall (British) “14-40” driven
alternately by the brothers Dick and Allan Clarke—-
the only British car to attack the record, and the
smallest of the four. The Vauxhall’s tally was
1479$ miles, an average of 61$ m.p.h. The first
record was made by Don Harkness’s Overland (51}
m.p.h.) ; the others were made by Withers and
Crouch in a Cleveland (58$ m.p.h.) and Norman
Smith and O. James in a Chrysler (61.08 m.p.h.).
The strain on tyres in the latest attempt was
terrific, and several sets of Dunlops were got through.
* * * *
“Bouragi” : Patsy Hendreii, the Middlesex
and England batsman and outfield, has definitely
decided to take the job of coach with the South
Aus. C. A. He will arrive in Adelaide next
September, and return for the 1928 English season ;
this last will disappoint South Australian Soccer
enthusiasts, who hoped to see the international
showing his paces in local football, as well as cricket.
Whether Hendren will play for South Aus. has not
yet been announced, but there is precedent, for J. N.
Crawford did so while a master at St. Peter’s College.
* * * >
There is one enraged bowler in Melbourne.
At a northern suburbs cricket match the other day
only two runs were required for the batting side to
win and the batsman due to accept the next ball
was a poor craftsman. When the bowler, who takes
an inordinately long run, started on his scamper,
so did the batsmen, and they had finished their run
before the man with the ball had recovered from
his surprise. The next ball was hit for one by the
other batsman. The umpire closed the match and
suspended decision until a higher ruling could be
obtained.
* * # #
“F.S.” : Keith Millar, the Hawthorn-East
Melbourne cricketer, is claiming an Australian record
for a hit he made at practice recently. He lifted
the ball 170 yards, according to stepped-out measure-
ment. The English record is 175 yards, made at
Oxford in 1856 by Rev. W. Fellowes.
* * * *
“Past Grammar” : With cricket going down
the sky, there is keen anticipation of the big foot-
ball programme ahead, as far as N.S.W. is concerned.
The star attraction for the Ma State will be the
selection of the Rugby Union reps, who leave for
Britain in July. The trial games for selection will
begin on May 28 ; the Maoriland and Victorian Uni.
teams will be in Sydney then, and the opening trial
will be N.S.W. v. a combined Sydney, M.L. and
Vic. ’Varsity side. The final trial, between first
and second XV’s, will be played on June 6, and
then the selectors will get to work. The wisdom of
this last game is doubtful, since rivalry will be
intense, and Rugby trials are notorious for casual-
ties. The selectors are well supplied with candi-
dates for all departments but two. These, unfortu-
nately, are the most important links in a Rugby
side’s hegemony—the scrum-half and five-eighth. Two
of each will be wanted, and last year there was no
supreme scrum-half. Billy Sheehan and Tom Lawton
were the outstanding candidates for the stand-off
possie. Both have seen a lot of football.
* * * *
“Gate” : The split in Queensland League
football, which the N.S.W. League thought impor-
tant enough to warrant its intervention, was healed
at a meeting of all parties concerned in Sydney
last week. The agreement arrived at amounts to
giving the district unions, such as Brisbane and
Toowoomba, a nobler status, and, of course, a larger
cut of the gate than the State union was wont to
relinquish from the big games under its jurisdic-
tion. The Queensland union preserves its royal
prerogatives, and saves its face generally ; the ques-
tion of altering the constitution will be held in
abeyance till the end of the coming season. N. S.
Wales is content because the inter-State games, which
are the chief attraction of the season, will not be
marred.
“Adsum”: “Gate” (B. 17/2/’27) is out in
his deductions about the relative importance of foot-
ball offertories in Britain. Certainly 15,000 people
saw Wales v. England, but it was at Wrexham, quite
a hamlet compared with even Cardiff. Wrexham’s
15,000 is a stupendous gate by comparison. London
may supply up to 50,000 Rugby enthusiasts at the
big internationals, but it is a close holiday for the
code, which is not the case with Soccer internationals.
Not even Scotland disporting on a London arena will
stop the big Soccer League matches, and among them
they may draw 150,000. On January 15 London had
four English Cun matches, and trooped along to them
to the number of 160,000.
HIS PLEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The opening of the Madrid bullfighting season
at the Plaza de Toros aroused exceptional interest,
because armor for the horses was tested publicly
for the first time, by the Government’s order.”
I‘They’ve armed the bull-ling prads,” he read —his
honest heart was full.
“That ought to give the picadors, beside their mounts,
a pull.
Perhaps, to even matters up, they’ll clothe in mail
the bull.
“So year by year the sporting world grows more
and more humane,
And more reluctant to inflict unnecessary pain
On man or beast, from Madison-square in New York
to Spain.
“The pigeon-slaver’s almost had his sanguinary day;
His skill on victims loosed from traps he’s ceasing
to display,
There’s just as dext’rous marksmanship in grassing
birds of clay.
“No more across our Sydney swards shall eager
greyhounds tear,
Intent their cruel jaws to Close upon the timid hare;
to chase a metal one is just as thrilling ah affair.
“They’ve armed the bull-ring mokes. These Dona
move with the times, you see.
And now,” he feelingly pursued, “what about arm-
ing me?”
He was, perhaps you may have guessed, a football
referee.

THE INKY WAY.
“Midford” : Startling contents bills? This
was the announcement that met the eye
outside Sydney stationers’ shops on Friday
morning:—
D.T. A PENNY TO-DAY.
It sounded as if some enterprising vintner
had put a new line of pinkie on the market.
“Julian”: I had an unusual experience
recently. The editor to whom I had sub-
mitted an article courteously replied that
‘considerations of space alone precluded its
acceptance,” adding that, anticipating my
ncent, he had sent the thing with a cover-
ing note to a paper in another State, which
paid higher rates than he did. Hand-
some of him, I say. The unusual feature is
that after it appeared in the other rag he
.ifa;d it for his own columns.
“Hamer”: When the Sydney Sunday
Times was established, it was W. H. Leighton
Bailey who pushed the barrow for a start,
although others reaped most of the profit
later. The old man, who made his entry
into Australian journalism 67 years ago hi
NT. Queensland and was connected at one time
or another with most of the leading Aus-
tralian papers, remained in the game until
lie was well over SO. He is now living in
retirement at Worthing, England, and, at
(0, is probably the oldest living Australian
journalist.
“Centurion”: Chinese Nationalists have
shown J. T. Lang the proper way to control
the press. Instead of imposing a tax an 1
seeing it declared invalid by a High Court,
they have simply notified that editors of
Chinese papers will be shot forthwith, if
their journals publish the wrong sort of
propaganda. “Though not prohibited from
appearing,” says the cable cautiously, “no
papers are being published.” Lang must
often feel sorry he isn’t a Chinese Nation-
alist.
“F.S.”: The offices of the ill-fated Sux
in Flinders-street, Melbourne, have been a
white elephant for a long time owing to the
fact that they had been converted at great
expense to the purposes of newspaper pro-
duction and would have needed much more
expenditure to restore them to ordinary use.
Now Smith’s Newspapers have purchased
them for £115,000, a price that works out at
a frontage value of £1742, which is not
modest for the locality. The Herald is
once more faced with the prospect of even-
ing competition. It has had a wonderful
run, and as its circulation grows the read-
ing matter grows ever harder to find in the
vast bulk of its advertisements.
“Tasiriki” : I was running a N.S.W. coun-
try rag, and occasionally inflicted some c
my own verse on my readers. They bore-
patiently, but, then, most of them owed for
a couple of years’ subscription. A worst
poet kept sending in contributions, whiei
helped to fill the w.p.b. At last his poeti-
frenzy culminated in a 96-line epic, entitle-
“ The Battle of Pozieres.” It was deadly
but I felt that he deserved a chance for )'■'
perseverance, and spent a strenuous evenim,
touching it up. I printed it on the fron
page that. week under the vague captio-
“Contributed.” The author wrote to im
rather dejectedly, saying that he was sorr.
•that someone had got in ahead of him on ti ;
same subject, but he thought it was no
nearly so good as his.
“Bill O’C.”: “Reg. V.” asks (B. 17/2/’27i
why rich Australians, when deciding to u
something for the arts, always reject t 1
claim of letters. They don’t always. &
one reason why so few prizes are offered.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Lang tax of a halfpenny a copy on Sydnev

Court on Thursday.”
A penny for a daily
Again one tenders gaily,
Nor adds a cent, with Vale
For wistful epitaph.
A paper for a copper,
As is but right and proper.
Has Lang- sustained a cropper?
Not ’arf he hasn't—not ’arf!
Quoth he. “They ban and blight me;
Down day by day they write me,
Arraign, accuse, indict me,
And jeer and sneer and strafe.
The tax each rag I’ll clap on
And load each sausage-wrap on
Will give ’em more to yap on,
Not ’arf it won’t, not ’arf!”
So man, proud man, proposes,
And oft thereby discloses
That all the law he knows is
A rocky sort of staff.
Grave judges met, a many,
“Excise,” they said. Not any
State can impose a penny—

My brown that's always nigh me,
Lo! once again you’ll buy me

And, peradventure madder?

Even the ushers were awed into silence
when Dame Nellie Melba tripped lightly
on to the boards at Melbourne Auditorium
one night last week in habiliments that were
not in the least incongruous, though they
would have been equally suitable to a blush-
ing beginner. Nor was the awe in any way
diminished when the wonderful lady pro-
ceeded to make a frontal attack upon such
barbed-wire entanglements as Voi Dhe
Sapete” (Mozart) and the dramatic Willow
Song from “Otello” (Verdi). Some slight
shrinking in the scope of the diva’s pro-
grammes is naturally to be expected, and her
masterly technique and great histrionic gift
were stiles that helped her over many an
awkward hurdle; but it was still a delight
merely to hear her speak tlie'opening syllables
of the last-mentioned tragic fragment. Nor
was the pure melody missing from such deli-
cate lyrics as “Les Papillons” (Chausson,
and “Serenade,” by Richard Strauss, in which
the lady made one feel that even a Venus
de Milo with its arms knocked off is pleas-
anter to look on than a brand-new plaster
statue such as are commonly to be found in
public gardens. And when she sat down art-
lessly at the grand piano and sang “Home,
Sweet Home,” the appropriate exclamation
could only be “the old Melba.”
* * * *
With her usual acumen the Dame has fas-
tened on a suitable popular offering in
Stuart Robertson, the new English basso.
This fresh-faced young man sang with all the
seriousness of youth and the sincerity of an
angelic choir-boy. His pure voice did not
range widely, but his enunciation of the
simple Anglo-Saxon ditties selected was per-
fect. In blowing “By the Brook” (Wetzger)
through his flute, the estimable John Lem-
mone demonstrated that even a particularly
exacting arrangement of trills and quavers
had no terrors for him. Fritz Hart mounted
the rostrum and conducted the Melbourne
Symphony Orchestra through a fantasy of
his own composition, which evoked memories
of Percy Grainger.

Revivals of plays are pesky things unless
the play revived happens to have been the
work of a genius, in which case revival is the
wrong word, since the thing was never dead.
But most of the plays which delighted our
fathers and ourselves turn out to be curi-
ously empty when refurbished and trotted
out again. Once they fitted into time ansi
place. Now they seem almost as irrelevant
as yesterday’s leading article. Of such is
“Sweet Nell of Old Drury,” resurrected at
Melbourne Royal on Saturday. A great play
it is not, though there are some admirable
scenes, such as that in which Nell assumes
the wig and gown of the sinister Judge
Jeffreys and orders things very much to the
advantage of the late objects of the Judge’s
vengeance. But there is little in the play
that fastens oyster-like on the memory. There
is less of sap than sentiment in any of the
characters, and the King whose four years
of dalliance with lovely Nell cost him a
cool £60,000 is sketched as politely as if he
were a member of the blameless dynasty of
Windsor.
* * * *
But if time has stripped Paul Kester of
the claim of having written a great romantic
drama, it has failed to separate Nell Stewart
from her reputation of a finely emotional,
temperamental and archly unexpected artist.
On Saturday night an overflowing house
admitted as much in no uncertain manner.
The venerable actress’s portrayal of the
feminine larrikin who so quickly learned the
side-door into Charles the Second’s heart was
as fresh as a newly-minted shilling. Even
on the gymnastic side alone it would have
been amazing, and if those astonishingly
nimble feet did not take Miss Stewart into
the deeper precincts of the passions that
wasn’t her fault so much as the playwright’s.
Arthur Greenaway as the King was not suf-
ficiently seized with a sense of his own import-
ance, apparently; his was a flat and some-
what lifeless portrait. Norman Campbell
spread terror as the Judge who holds the.
record of sentencing 350 persons to be hanged
at one sitting. In this play he is a consist-
ently malignant creature who snorts, takes
snuff and nearly bursts with melodramatic
hatred. Nella Campbell capably discoursed
and served drinks as Tiffin, the barmaid; and
Poland Conway, Edmund Duggan and Mil-
dred Cottell helped.
Melbourne Palace, which is subject to
sudden geographical excursions, is at present
concentrating its attention on “Gum-tree
Gully,” by Kate Howarde, author of the pre-
viously successful “Possum Paddock.” The
latest outpouring of the lady's eucalyptic
muse is as traditionally Australian as the
live kookaburra which infests the back fence
throughout the play is the genuine article.
There are Mum and Dad, untutored. jewels
of the bush, who shyly recall their own
springtide as they contemplate through tear-
dimmed eyes the love affairs of the various
young couples in the cast. There is the
daughter of the house whose unfounded sus-
picions about her husband’s fidelity allow
temporary weeds to spring up in the garden
of affection. There is the villain whose
elegant riding-boots are ever glittering sinis-
terly in the heroine’s vicinity, and there is
the comic rouseabout who pursues the scoun-
drel’s attempts to be serious with relentless
force. It goes without saying that the plot
is never permitted unduly to interfere with
the broad good-humor pervading the home-
stead, and it goes equally without saying that
the conventional stereotypes of the inhabi-
tants of Gum-tree Gully are perfectly secure
in the hands of the all-Australian troupe.
Walter Cornock is endowed by Nature with
a face that would for ever prohibit him
applying for such parts as Hamlet and Sven-
gali, and in this play, as the son of the
house, he contends with Fred Stephenson for
the best of the mots. Cora Warner is a
genuinely-delightful Mum without a wile or
a bit of stage cunning in the composition of
her style. Vivian Edwards, who has been
committing stage crimes as far back as this
Showman can remember, gets himself cor-
dially detested as the villain, and Alex.
McPherson vies with him in the possession of
the best-dressed pair of riding breeches in
the piece. The two most artistic members
of the congress are Mollie Raynor, who, as a
moronic village damsel, scores innumerable
loud guffaws, and the previously mentioned
kookaburra, whose style of acting recalls the
methods of Guy BaLes Post.

The spectacle of a score of well-fed Reper-
torians being thrown to the lions attracted
satisfactory audiences to Melbourne Royal
during last week. The impression gained
was that an amateur performance is none
the worse for being well staged and com-
petently directed, and the effect on the audi-
ences of having their inattentive parts com-
fortably stabled could hardly be under-rated.
Nevertheless, none of these factors could
conceal the fact that the Repertory Society,
though probably as fortunate as its Sydney
sister in the possession of capable actors,
has a tail, and that the chief defects of
the appendage are thin voices and a style
of elocution usually associated with school
concerts. These faults are not often toler-
ated on the legitimate stage, whose pro-
ducers know what hash an inadequately-
equipped super, can make of a situation
carefully huilt up hy the labors of highly-
paid principals. There is no reason why
the Repertory Society should tolerate them.
They can usually be eradicated by daily
vocal exercises in front of a mirror, prefer-
ably not when shaving.

A Rupert of the brush: —
If Tintaldra (Vic.) is a student of the traditional
school of Australian art, it certainly won’t recognise
itself in the mirror held up to it by Rupert Bunny.
The veteran artist has been applying the principles
“TELL ME MORE,” AT SYDNEY
HER MAJESTY’S.
Gus Bluett in a Charles II. costume, and
Leo Franklyn as a golfer.
portrayed in his recently exhibited European can-
vases to the local scene, and the result is sometimes
exhilarating and sometimes something different. Like
some cockies, Bunny is fond of leaving his dead
stumps standing, and dead stumps aren’t always an
ornament to a picture. .Still, he should be com-
mended for his courage and sincerity in tackling sub-
jects not in themselves pictorial. By these means
he often captures the Australian landscape’s untidy
charm, as in No. 6, “Trees Near Tintaldra,” and
there is much pleasure to be derived from his subtle
color patterns; hut his determination to paint his
emotions rather than the actual forms oft-times
results in mountain ranges as much like mountain
ranges as a house would be like a house if it were
built on the same principles by a temperamental
bricklayer.
“GUM-TREE GULLY." AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Return to the stage of the good old-fashioned
villain and hero, Vivian Edwards and
Alex. McPherson.
On Monday, Melbourne Tivoli greeted tlie
Kwong Sing Wah troupe of accomplished
acrobats and mystery-makers without resent-
ment, despite the expense their compatriots
are putting the British taxpayer to in
China. Tlic Cansinos returned and re-
affirmed their proficiency in the Spanish
dance.
* * * *
One revue co. treads on the echoes of the
last at Melbourne Bijou, where Phil Smith
has succeeded to the cap and bells of the
reverend Geo. Wallace. The new enterprise
is a little less incoherent than its predeces-
sors —it contains a trifle more plot than rot,
in fact, but not enough to strain the intellect
unduly. Smith bulges the suit of a comic
schoolboy, while Florence Hunter, who
was one of Hugh Ward’s acquisitions, un-
veils a steam-oil-waved shingle to the mellow
beams of Cynthia, located above the upper-
circle. The figure seven was always regarded
as the magic number by the ancients, but
revue promoters have a superstitious regard
for six. That is the precise tale of sunny
smiling shemales who discompose the chorus.
* * * *
A new cultural movement: —
The genii who sell more or less expensive keys
wherewith to unlock the treasures of the ether in
Victoria found they required twice as much room
for their show this year as they did last, so they
requisitioned the Exhibition. Broadcasting had its
accidental origin in the discovery of a ’Frisco firm
some six years ago that the music it had sent out
for experimental purposes had been picked up by
scores of amateurs and that they were thirsting for
more. As indicating the rapid growth of the art
or business, one U.S.A. corporation claims that since
1923 its sales of sets have increased from nil to
600,000 per annum, and it is gratifying to note
the number of Australian firms that are following
in its footsteps. The literature of the new cultural
movement has already reached appalling dimensions.
A stall at the present show offers 100 radio journals,
20 of them Australian, and three of them specially
addressed to crystal-set users, although there is none
as yet which caters exclusively for users of the neigh-
boring cocky’s fence as an aerial. The chief feature
of the show is the steady increase in the aristocratic
expensiveness and elegance of equipment- Loud-
speakers in the shape of books and hand-painted
plaques abound. A 15-valve set, capable of pit king-
up any mixture of music and static disseminated
anywhere in the world, is available to anyone with
a spare £l2O in his pocket ; and the fact that it
cannot raise Mars indicates conclusively that Mars
is a barbarous x>lanet which has no broadcasting-
stations. A regrettable feature is that no striking
improvement is discernible in the quality of the
growls emitted by loud-speakers, which still assault
the sensitive ear less wooingly than the cheapest
combination of crystal and cat’s whisker. A portable
set, which may be carried like a Gladstone in the
hand, enables the stroller along quiet country lanes
to escape boredom by carrying his own entertainment
with him.
** * *
Melbourne Majestic is this week “Out
To Win” with an exciting melodrama of
radium and the Balkans, and William Rus-
sell and Virginia Faire are supporting the
interest on “Wings of the Storm.” The
unwritten law against laughter in picture-
palaces is nightly disregarded at Hoyt’s,
where “The Skyrocket” is the moving story.
Ralph Graves is going to the dogs in "Blar-
ney,” the assisting feature, while the attrac-
tive Renee Adoree is standing by to fetch
him home again.
“Peg o’ My Heart” arrived on Saturday to
amuse Sydney Opera House audiences foi
the last week of the Nellie Bramley Season,
and the leading lady succeeded in keeping
the house in ripples of laughter, albeit she
rather overdraws the gaucheries of the girl
from America who causes upset and a final
re-assessment of her value in the English
home of her aristocratic relatives. George
Hewlett presents a rather self-satisfied Jerry,
the person who, besides being Peg’s lover,
turns out to be her legal guardian, and
Brett Randall works the humor of the Johni-
fied Alaric very capably. Rutland Beckett
makes Christian Brent the traditional vil-
lain of Victorian melodrama; but even if, as
a villain, he had to be faithless to his wife
and infant, it is hard to guess why he wants
to burden himself, even for a few weeks, with
a lady as snappy and ill-tempered as Mabel
Gower makes Ethel Chichester. Marie
Dalton, Raymond Casley, Robert Purdie
and Millie Carlton, who was capable
as the maid Bennett—it is a matter for sur-
prise that Brent never tries to kiss her—
completed the cast. That is, excepting the
dog Michael, who, although rather bored by
proceedings before the footlights, gave a life-
like representation of a dog-figlit off-stage,
V 'l' * v
Saturday brings another deluge of new
shows for first-nighters, an assorted deluge,
too. Notes such as Sydney has not heard
for 23 years will rain from the piano at the
Sydney Town Hall when Paderewski seats
himself. The Gilbert and Sullivan co. will
change from “The Mikado” —in which Wini-
fred Williamson’s understudy, Beatrice Kend-
rick, had her first opportunity during the
season on Saturday, and scored very well as
Ivatisha —to “Princess Ida” ; and the pictures
will take possession of the St. James Theatre
(where “Is Zat So?” finishes to-night) with
the feature film, “The Big Parade,” sur-
rounded with such embellishments as the
ingenuity of the people who produce these
things can suggest. At the Grand Opera
House Frank Neil guarantees a record
of laughter in “The Nervous Wreck,” which
has done big business elsewhere. “Tea for
Three” is dointr so well that it will last out
the season, which ends on March 24. at tli
Criterion, and then Judith Anderson and
Leon Gordon will take it on to Melbourne.
“Tell Me More” is satisfying all requirements
at Her Majesty’s: and full houses have de-
lighted the management of the Empire, where
“Sunny” is scattering brightness. “Hullo.
Healo” remains at the Palace.
The most talked-of person in Melbourne
at present is “Rose Marie,” the multitu-
dinous lady who dons the scenery of the
Canadian Rockies and the latest fashions of
gay Paree nightly at His Majesty’s. Vying
with her in public conversation is "The
Ghost Train” at the Athenaeum, whose direc-
tors are contemplating laying a branch line
for the country service. Some of the last
nights of Mrs. Cheyney at the King’s have
been diversified by the lady’s surprise in
finding Pirie Bush in Lord Arthur Dilling's
pyjamas instead of Alexander Onslow, who
has been indisposed. On Tuesday, at tin
Princess. Miss Hunter-Watts abandoned tin
attempt to divert the eighth Henry’s atten-
tion from the voluptuous curves of Anne
Bullen, and on Wednesday turned to the
easier task of convincing Marc Anthony
that she was his Cleopatra.
* * gs *
Another rebellion: —
The three years’ sustained revolt of the people
who call themselves “The Younger Group of Au-
tralian Painters’’ seems more kindergarten thai
hitherto at the exhibition held at Horderns
Gallery; - several of the sixth-form students are
absent in Europe and America. Liberal con
tributions by Robert Johnson, who has a delightful
appreciation of atmosphere, and Herbert R. Gallop,
particularly interesting in his treatment of such
subjects as “The Home Ti-trees,” “The Valley Farm
and “The Old Stable,” and the single offering ot
Lloyd Rees, "Hydrangeas,’’ in which the play of s
light from the side is ingeniously used, are the most
outstanding efforts. In addition there is nice work
from Dora Wilson —“The World so New and Old"
is the best, “The Brass Bowl” being a not entirely
harmonious reflection in a mirror of a girl sitting
before it in colorful draperies—and from G. K.
Townshend, whose delicate landscapes are effective
without being distinctive. Apart from these, and a
few other things, the offerings in color vary from
conscientious student studies to grotesque slubbering?
of paint, showing no evidence of study whatever.

CORK-TIPPED
or PLAIN
Henry Gibbons has a “Group” in which the nudity
of a pair of children is exhibited with scant art,
whilst his “Peter” is a queer, longnecked, staring
child who has already developed the forearms of a
navvy. Gwendolyn Grant spoils the rather vivid face
of her “Ann” by poor detail and grandmotherly
hands; and Roland Wakelin, most distinctively the
rebel of the contributors, has splodged several can-
vases with masses of paint. Tom Hubble, in The
Empty Bottle,” has a rather clever, though immature,
portrait of a man inspecting a tilted whisky bottle
against the light with an expression of despair; and
a black-and-white section is fairly even in quantity.
In the Arts and Crafts section there is material for
interest, the hand-wrought jewellery of Rhoda Wager
being, as usual, excellent; and a bronze mask of
Hugh D. Mclntosh by Frank Lynch is a lively thing.
Ole Olsen and Chick Johnson, who arrived
at Sydney Tivoli on Monday, deserved all then-
preliminary boosting and more. From the
time they took possession, early m the pro-
ceedings, to curtain-fall they kept the theati e
with tl>'- assistance of sundry other per-
formers .no liad previously presented turns
of their own —in gusts of laughter ihe
stage is not big enough for their drolleries;
they spread themselves all over the house;
jokes that seemed finished revive themselves
with a double-barrelled effect in the midst,
of other nonsense; and there are burlesques
on vaudeville turns quite capable of stand-
ing by themselves which are merely inci-
dents in an avalanche of hilarity. The crisp,
incisive patter of Olsen and Johnson is a
model to all comedians. The manner m
which musician Don Alfonso Zclaya (who
is back on the other part of the programme
and very popular there) enjoyed Ins share
in the rollicking fun helped to delight the
house more; and Shy and Moore (also back)
and the others enlisted in the good cause
appeared equally appreciative. Frank Syi-
vestre and his nephews provide another win-
ner, the nephews being three midgets who,
with avuncular aid, do remarkable acrobatic
feats; and the Armand Brothers must be
listed’ amongst the neatest exponents of a
physical act seen in Sydney—there is not a
thing they do without contriving to give a
new turn to it. Billie Lockwood, very popu-
lar although grown rather full-sized for her
child-stuff, is another new item in a pro-
gramme that has reached liigh-water mark.
Fullers’ Theatre, from which Arthur Buck-
ley and his mystic devices are due to vanish
this week, is keeping to a full programme of
vaudeville that is of f.a.q. standard. With
the hard job of opening the bill, Ella Good-
man succeeds very well with sentimental
songs; but Moreni and Dolly Varna, with
some broad travesties of Salv’army songs, and
the colored duo, Stompy and Stella, get the
most applause.
Traffic regulations forbid Wirths’ Circus
from marching into the Sydney Hippo-
drome with the band.instruments blaring and
the caparisons gleaming gaily on elephants
and horses, but the show will open with all
its old splendors and many new attractions
to-night (Thursday) in the big Ilaymarket
building. Wirths’ Circus at this season of
the year has become an institution; and the
management mentions, amongst the new
events, a troupe of people who will behave
like flies by doing their tricks on the ceiling
of the building, and another man who sup-
ports on his head human weights totalling
10001 b.
At Hoyt’s and the Strand, Sydney:—-
•‘The Rlonde Saint” lias no touch of jazz—from
cabarets it’s free.
No scene as yet so well is set in sunny, Sicily.
There is no taint in “The Blonde Saint,” and Lewis
Stone she hates;
Put ho pursues this girl he wooes, and tangles up
their fates.
One black, black night lie grabs her tight, and leaps
into the waves,
But fishermen sail up just then and save them from
wet graves.
Upon an isle they live a while, until a plague arrives:
'rile hero then does work of ten in saving human
lives.
The saint so blonde soon gets quite fond of him she
used to hate:
Heroic deeds are all she needs to find in him a mate.
In scenery that’s lovely she makes love without
restraint,
Though gents, aver that they prefer a blonde that’s
not a saint!
At the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, "Abie’s
Irish Rose” is in full bloom. The spectacle
of Jack Trainer and John McCabe nursing
half a twin nightly rouses the gallery to
delirium pitch. At the Prince of Wales “The
Alarm Clock” stopped with a bang, the co.
disbanding. Guy Hastings and others in the
east arranged to open in “The Squaw Man,”
under William Anderson management. The
Majestic is serving up a rattling good show,
with Joe Brennan and Ida Newton heading
the bill.
Poverty
Point
ST. FETER : “Are you coinin’ in or are you not?”
MELBA: “Ah, Peter. Just one more farewell concert:”
“Curtain Raiser”: “Gumsucker” (B.
24/2/’27) asks why Australian audiences
won’t listen to grand opera in English. 1
think it is because they feel that if they
did, the sentiment often being trite and the
expression of it triter, the whole gorgeous
illusion would be spoiled. If “Gumsucker”
wants to realise the sad hollowness of some
of these visiting virtuosi, he should listen
to a stout Italian tenor singing “Voi Che
Sapete.” or some such passionate fragment,
and then hear the same gentleman ask
Fate to Let Him Like a Soldier Fall in
English. He would be a mild fellow if he
didn’t want to heave an usher at the singer.
“Old ’Un”: Died in London Charterhouse
a few weeks ago, Horace Lingard, an English
actor who was a prominent figure on Aus-
tralian boards close on half a century ago.
With his wife —a prepossessing woman and
an excellent artist known as “Miss Lingard
-—lie introduced to us such English successes
as “Our Boys,” “The Two Orphans” and
“David Garrick,” afterwards turning his
attention to comic opera. The curtain fell
in his 90th year.
“Goldilocks”: Itufe Naylor remarked at
the conclusion of the opening performance of
"Sunny” that his directors had provided him
with another £lOO,OOO, and that he was oil
to Melbourne to see about a new Empire
theatre there. The members of the new com-
bination are reputedly shrewd; I hope they
are shrewd enough to realise that too much
zeal is as dangerous in the theatrical busi-
ness as in diplomacy. Inexperience sticks out
in many things associated with the Empire
venture, and big houses will be needed to
make things pay. To secure “Sunny” and
“The Student Prince,” which is to follow,
the new management had to bid high. The
company, however individual salaries com-
pare with those of actors in competing enter-
prises, is an expensive one; and extravagance
is obvious in some directions, while neces-
sary details have been overlooked.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Dorothy Seacombe
had only breathing-space between her last
appearance in “Aloma” and her first in “Give
and Take” at the Globe. “Give and Take”
impressed London as a rollicking farce, with
touches of undisguised burlesque, and won
roars of laughter. Dorothy was happily
cast for one of the young lovers. Edward
do Tisno, as her stage father’s foreman, got
all the bald-headed fun possible out of his
role.
"Ivelby” : John Ralston had an excellent
excuse for taking liberties with the police-
man’s part in “The Pirates” (B. 24/2/’27).
His Lauder and knut imitations were so
excellent that the show was held up whilst
the house rocked with laughter. We go to
G. and S. to be amused. If Ralston or any
other player is able to add a litle extra amuse-
ment to the original, why get hysterical about
it?
“Caul Boy” : “The Ghost Train,” now run-
ning at Melbourne Athenaeum, is attracting
so much favorable attention that a second
division is likely, to do the “smalls.” It will
be a handy conveyance to cart around the
countryside. There is only one set, and that
a deliberately sordid one, and the spectre of
the train, whose secret is so carefully
guarded, is probably more ingenious than
expensive.
“Hamfat”: The
most curious gift
from the audience
in my memory was
delivered during a
performance at the
old Sydney Stand-
ard Theatre, where
a scratch company
was lighting hard
with destiny. The
ghost had ceased
to walk, and one
of the mummers
found it necessary
to temporise with
an angry washer-
woman who had
declined to hand
over his shirts. As
a propitiatory mea-
sure he gave her
a pass for front
seats in the stalls.
That night, during
an impressive stage
moment, a bundle
of clothing wrap-
ped in a copy of
the S. M. Herald
was heaved over
the footlights and
fell at the mum-
mer’s feet. “Your
washing’s no good
to me, anyway.
Here it is, if you’re
too mean to pay
for it!” yelled the
indignant lady who
had done the heav-
ing. Even the poor
house was able to
raise a roar of
laughter as the
mummer dashed off
stage carrying a
pared which dropped collars and socks be-
hind him.
“Spearshake”: Why all this reverence
about the G. and S. operas? Not a line or
a make-up must be altered from the initial
production. By this time the G. and S.
operas have become classics in their way;
hut look what has happened to Shakspeare.
Whole chunks of Shakspeare’s works are
callously omitted nowadays. If these mutila-
tions are regularly allowed in Shakspeare,
why should we frown in horror at an altera-
tion of a text or the addition of a bit of
“business” in comic opera? If Shakspeare
can stand his works being cut, and even pro-
duced in modern attire, Gilbert needn't turn
in liis grave as rapidly as the Bard whizzes
nowadays.
“Hamfat” : Few circus acts have stirred
the juvenile imagination like that of “Pro-
fessor” Peart, incidentally referred to in
“Dr. Nil’s” reminiscent par. (B. 3/3/’27).
It was in Sydney that Peart, coming down
from the specially high circus peak into his
10-foot tank, just grazed the edge of it as
he entered the water. He was able to walk
to his dressing-room, but collapsed and died
almost immediately. Sydney mothers, while
sorry for the man, were relieved to see the
last of his act. Ambitious small boys, fired
by the “Professor’s” deeds, used to rake old
baths from rubbish tips, fill them with water
and dive into them from sheds and fence
tops. Whilst his season lasted there was
an epidemic of broken arms and bandaged
heads amongst the boyhood of Sydney.
“Lud”: Noel Coward, the English actor-
dramatist, who has given the British prudes
cause for great uneasiness, has produced in
London “This Was a Man,” a comparatively
clean play—and it failed. Coward’s new
piece, “The Marquise,” has been special!'
written for Marie Tempest, who made a hit
with “Hay Fever,” from the same indus-
trious pen.
“R.K.D.N.”: Australia is to sec “The
Ringer,” Edgar Wallace’s meaty drama of
crooks and ’tecs, which has been filling
London Wyndham’s Theatre since May last
year. Maurice Moscovitch will do it in
Melbourne.
“T.P.O’C.”: If the new Sydney Empire
can supply good shows at the present low
tariff, there will be troublesome times ahead
for the down-town concerns. Still, past ex-
perience does not suggest a lasting reduction
in prices. When Clarke and Meynell opposed
the Williamsons with “Hook of Holland,'"
they undercut the old Firm; but box-office
pressure of an unexpected kind sent the
tariff up. Ward, too,, increased prices
after leaving the Opera House for the St,
James. Charging more for Saturday and
holiday nights—a bad habit copied from the
old-established theatres and the pictures—
is the first nibble upwards of the Rufc
Naylor syndicate.
“Flaming Youth”: The joy that is in
Heaven over one sinner that repenteth is
felt now in the Fuller offices; for Mo (Roy
Rene) has come back again and is to part
ner his old colleague Stift'y (Nat Douglas).
The combination goes back so far that even
the principals are vague as to when it
began ; but it was so long ago and so popu-
lar that during the war any pair of Diggers
who formed what seemed an incongruous
mateship were nicknamed “Stiffy and Mu
right away. The rough-as-bags material the
pair served to a convulsed public owed its
popularity as much to the use of Australian
slang as to the comedians’ knock-about
methods. Whatever their demerits, they were
pioneers in Australianising vaudeville com-
edy, hitherto mainly of the Cockney, Yiddish
or Bowery type. After the quarrel which
smashed up the combination Mo went to
Perth. He made a hit in “straight” comedy
with Harry Green in “Give and Take,’ ami
Green talked about taking him to London:
but Williamson bitched him up with Fred
Bluett —not altogether a successful combina-
tion. Mo will be glad to be back with his
old partner, and the public will be gladder.
“Tasmanian Devil”: “Curtain Raisers
par about “Siegfried” (B. 17/2/’27) reminds
me of “Macbeth” as 1 saw it staged some
years ago at the Hobart Royal. The banquet
scene gave the impressfom that Macbeth was
a true Scot, except perhaps in the matter ot
whisky. There was nothing on the festal
board save a few bare wooden platters ani
empty wooden goblets. As the managemeu
dispensed with the curtain between scenes
merely darkening the stage, I could see tin
bodies of the slain get up and stroll on.
“Hamfat”: H. H. Wallace, who ha-
returned to Australia, shared with Crane t
juvenile roles in the 1906-07 Gilbert and o# ■
van co., of which Howard Vernon, ito
Castles and Celia Ghiloni were members,
was a big lift for the young entertainer, w "
subsequently went to London and has si
appeared in Australia again. Wallace m
nephew of Rose Scott, who meant so m
to the feminist movement.
“Hamfat” : The all-capturing movies ha'
collared artist-entertainer Bert Levy, "
at a princely salary, goes into the Mem
Goldwyn Mayer studios, not as an a rtL
but as a scenario-writer. He offered 0
story to the firm, which immediately one
him a salary. Bert, who gave Ihe w
letin some of its best Jewish jokes net
lie left Australia, distressed his commer
relatives in Melbourne in his youth,

but an apprenticeship to scenic artist w f
Gordon found him his right place. 1 ..
later, after having done much work as at ■■
and writer, Bert published a ships PJ.

“Mrs. Charlie Chaplin said: ‘Charlie wished me
to go to England to settle down... .but 1 would not
stand for the children being taken there.... I will
not have them brought up in English schools and
taught English manners.’ ” — Brisbane Daily Mail.
All Hollywood lay sleeping ’neath placid moon and
star,
Save where the cars went sweeping to opium-joints
afar,
Or where some bandits looting had careless noise to
spare, i
Or sounds of rapid shooting bespoke some love affair;
All Hollywood lay sleeping beneath the quiet sky,
Deaf to a mother’s weeping and her soft lullaby;
“Baby, minej Baby mine!
Daddy’s so dumb that I’ve drawn the line;
He’d have you in England if he’d his way—
Thank Gahd, you’ve a mother-r to watch and pray!
He’d Eton and Oxford you, if he could,
Ear, far from civilised Hollywood;
But mother knows when to draw the line,
Baby mine! ”
All Hollywood lay dreaming—of dollars and divorce—
Save for a maiden screaming (and guns again, of
course) ;
Over the way a rattle to cognoscenti told
Of some bootleggers’ battle about their liquid gold;
All Hollywood lay dreaming, save for a murdered
few,
As with her fond eyes streaming that mother sang
anew:
“Baby dear! Baby dear!
Mother is by and there’s nought to fear ;
But tli'ank the Lord on your dimpled knees
You’re safe from those bogeys overseas.
With Hollywood and the simple life,
You’ll live to divorce your twentieth wife;
So sleep, my pretty, there’s nought to fear,
Baby dear! ”

Rexona is Sure
to Help You!
If you suffer from Piles, Eczema, Bad Legs, Varicose Ulcers,
Ringworm, Hives, Sores on the Head, Falling Hair, Dandruff,
Burns or any eruption or irritation of the skin, Rexona will bring
you prompt relief. If you have tried many old-fashioned Oint-
ments and been disappointed, try Rexona and you will be
delighted with the results.
Rexona soothes and stimulates the parts affected, and although
the sufferer may be quite unconscious of it, Rexona never ceases
to exercise its healing powers, and so builds up the tissues and
makes your skin sound and healthy. Those who are wise will
always be prepared for emergencies by keeping a pot of Rexona
handy.

T.A.8.: “Ah, is she really dead?” Dunno;
but tbe verse i 5.... G.L.M.: You were right in saying
that “this thought, like all that I hold dear, will
vanish in the tomb”... .Flotsam: Good idea, if you
bale a few buckets of the tears out of it... .Ena D.:
“The Hidden Mystery” will remain hidden.... Jock
McG.: We stopped your “Ticklin’,” Jock... .P.R.W.:
You’re very weak in your “Uppers” story.... Cam
D.: Your convivial song left the impression that you
do your drinking in the morgue.... Emma G.: It's
the old minstrels’ “Little Sister’s Gone to Sleep”
shorn of melody. .. .Will Yam: To print your verse
in praise of Lang would be fiendish cruelty....
G. : Seven thousand words. Dash your verbosity !
....May S. S.: The only thing you didn’t mention
about your nice young hero was whether he wore
Oxford bags or just the usual style of pants....
Edward E.: We’ve had to stand a lot of this recently:
Harbor of beauty ! Mine !
With Manly’s wooded shrine,
And Lane Cove,- the divine,
To thee I cling.
From Homebush to the Heads
Nature her beauty spreads
With gen’rous hand ;
Wahroonga ! Warrawee!
Clyde ! Auburn ! Botany !
Names ever dear to me,
Where’er I stand!
....Rosie R.: An amazing mass of nonsense....
Anna. G.: Any appeal to Death to take you in his
arms will have to be much better done.... Jack W.:
The “poets immortal” certainly gave you no help in
that monstrosity... .W.A.M.: The manor, the dark
moor and Sir Robert don’t fit into The Bulletin
style. .-.M.L.D.: If you get over the habit of think-
ing anything will do as long as you get the rhyme
you may succeed.... Rosa D.: Ray throws its light
nicely, but is too slight.. ...Hilary L. It.: Promising
work, but immature. .. .E.lt.M.: Not in our line....
Allen T.: “Black Opal” is no poetic gem....
Iv.M.: Your “Wife” is married to doggerel....
Dunbar: Much too wordy... .P.L.8.: The incident
might be worth a par... .M.L.L.: One may d 0....
D. : Revelations like that should come crisply and
finish the yarn .W.H.8.: Fails to grip.... Jolly
T.: Note that you wrote that 4000-word horror
“for a joke.” Reading it was no joke.... Gil E.:
The finish it needed was found in the w.p.b
R.0.T.: Exactly... .L.R.8.: One may do elsewhere.
....R.C.H.: Verses confuse themselves —and u 5....
E. : Good start; lack of finish was its finish.
. ...H.V.H.: Sorry; it still fails to make a story.
... .Telma A.: Advice given as requested... .L.H.P.:
Unfortunately the verse dies away... .M.G.: We’ll
give the end of the new “Lochinvar” a fly:—■
At the marriage she was weeping,
Thinking of her sweetheart Jim,
And as she pledged her troth for ever
Both her eyes were growing dim.
And when the ceremony was over,
Came to her her lover, Jim;
All restraint she threw for freedom;
As in his arms she greeted him.
On his aeroplane they slithered
To his home so far away ;
While her husband got fair blithered,
And Jim is with his sweetheart May.
. ...D.O’C.: “The Drover’s Departure” is a confused
business... .Sour D.: One good line drowned in bad
ones.... Alan W.: One may do.. . .F.J.N.: No occa-
sion for harshness; well done but mechanical....
H. : Too much like a catalogue. . .L.P.A.: Both fall
through drifting round their point—if they hare a
point.... Harriet C.: Pity to waste a well-written
story on such a poor ending. .. .Tom M.: Verses fail.
Articles may do. ...W.8.: Found the new doctor
rather a dreary person... .Hilda W.: Sorry; it’s not
our style. Too long, anyway... .W.E.A.: One’s
more a political pamphlet than a story; the other
grips but needs some explanation of those jars....
E.F.L.: Vague... .E.R.M.: Banal lines spoil it....
Charob: Pale moralising for kids is no g00d....
J.D.C.: Very weak tea; Kipling’s was strong drink.
....Ben G.: The constancy of the bar-lady is rather
surprising. .. .L.J.M.: If the main story lived up to
the standard of the climax, it would d 0... .E.M.F.:
Good story; lacks Australian interest... .W.S.M.:
Too melodramatic.... D.8.0.C.: The fight with the
outlaw is well described, but the fact that Slim Tim
got his job is not sufficient story.... Mat W.: Would
be worth a par... .G. 5.8.: We’re far too loyal to
publish that loyal yelp.... Fer D.: Your characters
destroy themselves on the slightest provocation....
W.F.D.: Very trivial... .H.W.M.: Horriblemoral-
isings.... J.E. (Taranaki): Story starting with 500
words about .a lost collar-stud has no chance....
R.G.H.: Slight. .. .Will B.: Is “this bushland wonder
dome” any relation to the welkin, whose ringing is
beloved of loose versifiers?....R. Mag.: You’re the
first of the loyal versifiers to think of rhyming
“Canberra—ever”.... Beth C.: Poor, artificial idea.
... .Elita: The rhymes are awful. .. .D.F.: The melo-
drama contains, among other defects, a Chinaman
who speaks like a Frenchman and sometimes imagines
he is Italian. .. .P.G.W.: Two are being given a
chance... .T.X.W.: The track-tragedy has awkward
lines.... Jim M.: Your “Meat” is merely a sausage
of reflections... .P.J.W.: “The Call” is a scream of
doggerel... .A.B.C.:’The inquiry about the taste of
Sonny doesn’t make a meal... .C.T.A.: Take the
girl out in the pale moonlight and whisper it in
her ear. It’s of no interest to anyone else....
Pat: It’s a dreamy lot.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
D.R.: Not enthusiastic about the elongated flapper
smoking a fag....A.H.: “I do not know much about
drawing.” Why stress the obvious?... .L.M.W.:
Your orchardist looks as if he had just dropped
from a ’plane... .N. 8.: Balance your figures, make
the other objects more definite, and cut out the slip-
shod patches. .. .K.D.: The joke is a cot case; the
drawing needs burial... .C.T.W.: Dave is not as
thick in the skull as all that... .T.H.: Contrast ir.
tones overdone... .J.8.G.: Rather promising; tuition
should bring you 0n... .E.R.A.: Joke impossible;
drawing collapsed under inspection. .. .E.J.P.: What-
ever Lang may be, he isn’t the Willie-boy of your
imagination... .W.A.H.: Buy a skull-cap and an
invalid’s chair for the gag; it’s in its dotage....
P.U.P.: Reminiscent of the puzzle drawings in
“Cole’s Funny Picture Book.”
“Mat”: On the list of highly-paid rural
workers may be entered the sandalwood-
getters of Coolgardie (W.A.). One lately, in
one week, pulled sandalwood to the value of
£96, which, after deducting the cost of clean-
ing and cartage, left £6O for one man with
a horse. His record for one day only was
a ton and a half, valued at £24. But I
wouldn’t advise anybody to come in the hope
of repeating the performance.

In this latest supplement there is a wide range of musical
numbers that will fill the hours with gladness. They prove
conclusively the supremacy of “His Master’s Voice” Records.
Ask your dealer for a copy or write us direct.
Greatest Artists—New Electrical Recording—Silent Surface.
Chaliapin.
The' superb re-recording of one of Chaliapin’s greatest records
makes a very memorable impression, for not only his singing but
also the orchestral and choral accompaniments are most realistically
reproduced.
12in. Red, 10/6.
D 8934 —Boris Godounov —Farewell of Boris.
Boris Godounov —Death of Boris.
Granforte-Hislop.
The great Italian Baritone, who made such a splendid impression
in Australia during 1924 Grand Opera Season, sings two well-known
duets reproduced for the first time by electrical recording. He is
supported by Joseph Hislop, the eminent English tenor, who will
visit Australia this year. One of the features of this great recording
is the wonderful volume of the orchestral accompaniment.
12in. Red, 10/6.
D 8939 —Boh&me, 0 Mimi tu piu.
Forza del Destino, “Solenne in quest’ora.”
Royal Opera Orchestra.
This is the first of a series of records made by the Royal
Opera Orchestra of Covent Garden, conducted by Eugene Goossens.
The two marches need no introduction to the public, whilst the
orchestral reproduction, which is as fine as could possibly be
achieved, offers for the first time an orchestral record of the
highest standard at a popular price.
12in. Plum, 6/-
C 1279 —Marche Hongroise Berlioz
Marche Militaire Schubert
Wilhelm Backhaus.
In his third new process record the great pianist gives us four
Etudes and one Prelude by Chopin. Backhaus’ all-Chopin Recitals
in Sj’dney and Melbourne amply demonstrated that he is a wonderful
interpreter of the emotional and dramatic music of the great com-
poser. The sweeping arpeggios of the C Major Study and the
mighty chords of the “Revolutionary” Study are reproduced with
amazing effect.
12in. Red, 10/6.
DB92B—(a) Prelude in C Major, (b) Study in C Major . . Chopin
(c) Chromatic Study in A Minor Chopin
(a) Revolutionary Study Chopin
(b) Study in F Major ' Chopin
The Australian tour of the world’s greatest,
composer pianist is an event of utmost import-
ance. As an interpreter of the great masters,
I. J. Paderewski is unsurpassed. His truly
inspired interpretations are available in per-
manent form on “His Master’s Voice” Records.
Amongst them will be found works by Chopin.
Schubert, Schumann, Liszt and his own.
Two Choice Records.
DBB33 —Impromptu in B Flat. Op. 142 No.

D 8379 —Minuet in G Major. (Paderewski.)

Herbert Dawson (Organ).
)
Herbert Dawson’s organ records have made quite a sensation
during the last few months, and he adds another fine disc this
month, achieving a very magnificent effect in the “Hallelujah
Chorus” from “The Messiah” and the equally popular “Wedding
March” by Mendelssohn.
lain. Plum, 6/-
Cl27l—Hallelujah Chorus (“The Messiah”) Handel
Wedding March Mendelssohn
Symphony Orchestra.
Many Gramophone enthusiasts who have in their collection the
recently made wonderful Wagnerian Records of “Ride of the
Valkyries,” “The Funeral March,” “Prelude to Tristan” and others
will be delighted with the “Entrance of the Gods” from “Rhine-
gold,” which entirely eclipses these records.
13in. Black, 8/-
Dlll7 —“The Rhinegold”—Entrance of the Gods into
A alhalla Parts 1 and 2 IVagner
Zimbalist.
This favorite violinist makes this month his debut in electrical
recording. He plays very charmingly a Persian Song by Glinka
and one of Chopin’s most melodious waltzes. This record should
be of great interest to music lovers, because the artist will make
his first tour of Australia this year.

“Clerk”: Victorian railwaymen in the
Bendigo district are still talking about an
unheard-of coincidence in truck distribution
which occurred during the handling of txie
harvest. A truck (11791 i) was loaded
with wheat from a big stack at Meatian on
a Thursday, discharged at Williamstown,
returned empty to traffic, drafted to the mid-
land district, allotted to Meatian again, and
loaded from the very same stack a second
time, leaving for Williamstown on the Tues-
day. Meatian is 213 miles from Melbourne,
a Sunday intervened, and the truck on its
return trip had to pass through two big
marshalling-yards at Bendigo and Ivorong
Vale. The odds against the occurrence are
about 20,000 to one.
* * * *
“G.A.D.” : The recent motor-parking regu-
lations in Sydney press hard on the doctors.
Many a medico arrives at his consulting-
rooms in the morning to find a whole string
of cars blocking his way. They area t
patients; the explanation is that Macquarie-
street has become a sort of public park-
ing-ground for people who are too lazy
to leave their cars anywhere else. What is
perhaps worse, doctors find some difficulty in
getting near a hospital nowadays, as the
approaches are blocked by cars which
remain there all day in process of being
parked. In America a doctor’s car is dis-
tinguished by a special badge. If this idea
were introduced here, the doctor could park
his car wherever he wanted to.
* * * *
“Kriz”: An auctioneer’s sale flag flutter-
ing outside an office in Broome marked the
finish of the W.A. Pearlers’ Association,
formed in 1902. The association had evolved
a scheme for breaking up the Japanese
diving monopoly by training Chinese divers.
A lugger was fitted out, and an experienced
man Degan work training young Chinese who
had been specially indented. The cost of
the operations was to be met by a levy
of £2O per boat on the members, who con-
stitute about 60 per cent, of Broome pearlers.
One of the members refused to pay up, and
judgment was obtained against him in the
local court. He appealed, and the magis-
trate’s decision was reversed, with costs.
But the appellant is dubious about his chance
of recovering the latter from a body whose
effects consist of a typewriter, a table, a
cane chair and a bundle of customs forms.
* * * *
“Maurice G.”: The other day a woman
moving about a leading Melbourne emporium
was heard to clink and jingle like a shaken
money-box. Curious and presently suspici-
ous glances followed her; so did a shop-
walker, who “invited” her into the office.
There they found that she was wearing a
shoplifter’s underskirt, with one large pocket
made into compartments, so that stolen goods
would not collect into one accusing lump.
The lady had stopped a few drinks, how-
“ Mrs. Smythe has a lovely home —all fur-
nished on the instalment plan, they
tell me.”
“Yes, quite true. She's had four husbands
and got a little with each."
ever, got muddled, and put things that
rattled into the same compartment. In
one were a bottle of spirits, a tin of crab-
meat, a bundle of knives and forks, two
nail-files and a fountain-pen. These had
given her away.
* * * *
“Mag”: The cochineal insect, owing to
its cheapness, rapid increase and strict atten-
tion to business (though, it is true, only a
summer worker), promises to eliminate all
other means of prickly-pear eradication. A
cochineal optimist from near Warwick (Q.)
about 12 months ago settled a dozen or so on
a patch of pear behind his bails. To-day for
about 50 or 60 yards the pear is dead. The
other day Mr. Page, of Oaklands, on the
Barcoo, went to clear some remaining pear
on the property, and found the insects mas-
ters of the situation. Yet the nearest pear
treated was fully five miles away, and no
insect had been introduced on Oaklands.
These are isolated cases, but reports from
Central West are to the same effect.
* '* * *
“Sierra” : On January 20, 1927. the P. and
O. branch liner Ballarat landed her passen-
gers in Sydney after a passage of 55 days
from London. On January 14, 1875, the
windjammer Ben Voirlich landed hers in
Melbourne 64 days after leaving Plymouth.
Not a very great advance in half a century!
* * * *
“Tongio West”: “Mulyan” (B. 10/2/’27)
should come to Victoria if he wants to see the
gypsum and copi deposits. Huge beds of the
former and hillocks of the latter are scat-
tered throughout the Mallee, to the immense
benefit of landowners. Trucks of the stuff
are forwarded daily to Melbourne from Aus-
tral Gypsum Siding (nearly 300 miles away),
Bolton, Cliillingollah, Waitcliie and else-
where to be made into fibro-plaster. More
goes all over Victoria for use as a fertiliser.
The gypsum generally lies in beds about 3ft.
thick, about a foot under the surface, in flat
ground. Its existence is often denoted by a
growth of pigface on top. Teamsters at
Waitchie were making £lO a week and more
three years ago, and wheat cockies had great
difficulty in getting their wheat carted, as the
carters preferred handling gypsum. A fac-
tory is to be erected at Ouyen to make plaster
of Paris, etc., from the huge deposits in the
neighborhood.


A Twelve Years’ Record
of Endurance
November 14, 1926, was the twelfth anniversary of
the manufacture of Dodge Brothers Motor Cars.
An eventful twelve years! During that time
Dodge Brothers manufactured 1,800,000 motor cars
so enduringly and honestly built that over 90 per
cent, are still in use.
Through these twelve years Dodge Brothers Motor
Cars have been more and more widely used as
time has passed because the standards of sturdiness
and stability, which always marked them, have
continually been advanced.

It is noticeable that the

Maoriland Priminister Coates brought
back from the Imperial Conference a con-
viction that Maoriland should pay more
attention to defence; a notion that it ought
to shut down on assisted immigration in
the winter; and a great deal of enthusiasm
for the “privilege” of sending representa-
tives to foreign countries. The bit about
paying Father Bull more for the Navy origi-
nated with Seddon, appealed vastly to Ward,
and made a hit with Massey. It is unaccom-
panied by any proposal to put contributions
on a uniform basis —so much per head or
so much per £lO,OOO worth of property —
but that would be a rude departure from pre-
cedent.
The N.S.W. Parliament has always been
strong in poets. It has harbored such
laureates as Wentworth, Parkes, Jawbone
Neild (who wrote “Eftsoons the nascent
■waterspout arose”) and Colonel Mackay; but
very few Parliamentary poets have been able
to win a prize. Henry E. Horne, M.L.C.,
is one of the few. He was the successful
entrant in the “Beau Geste” competition
run by the Paramount film people, who say
they received 1000 poems—or alleged poems.
That is quite likely; The Bulletin receives
fully that number every springtime, and just
now is running up a big tally of verses in-
tended to greet the Yorks. Horne was one
of the schoolmaster members of a former
Labor Government, and made history by
defying Caucus. He was made an M.L.C.
by Holman. He has a talent for light topi-
cal verse, some of which has appeared in
The Bulletin.
Whatever are the weaknesses of Alex. Pea-
cock, Yic. Treasurer, galivanting abroad is
not one of them. He lias had many oppor-
tunities for pleasant jaunts at the public
expense and much better excuses for the
trips than some of the Commonwealth and
State politicians who never miss a chance of
taking one. As a member of 14 Governments
and boss of three his exes, for travelling have
been negligible. His longest pilgrimages out-
side Vic. were in 1897, when he attended ses-
sions of the Federal (Commonwealth Consti-
tution) Convention at Adelaide and Sydney.
Apparently his dame, who helps to keep his
constituency attached to liiip, has no greater
hankering for travel than he.
“G. Moses” : Ryan and Theodore, the latter
now member for Dailey (N.S.W.), were two
Queensland Premiers who came to Sydney in
search of a safe Federal Labor seat. Both
were from the south coast, Ryan being born
at Port Fairy (Vic.) and Theodore at Port
Adelaide (S.A.). They were young members.
Ryan was somewhere about 44 when he
went into Federal politics, while Theodore is
about 43. In each case a self-sacrificing local
Laborite gave up his seat and made room —
Con Wallace for Ryan and Mahony for Theo-
dore. Ryan never attained to Federal office
and died only months after his election.
Wallace, who made way for him, died exactly
50 days later. Having abandoned his secure
job at West Sydney he made a hopeless fight
for Nepean. Then he was provided with a
very poor sort of billet in Queensland, where
Theodore had succeeded to the Premiership.
On Ryan’s passing out Con returned to
Sydney to apply for his old seat, but lie was
brushed aside to make way for the pushful
Bill Lambert. He survived Bill’s election
by only 17 days.
Cables from China state that many strike
agitators have been decapitated in Shanghai
bv the Chinese authorities. In this country
they invariably “do their block” on their own
initiative.
Joseph Keif, who still thrives at Cliats-
wo.od, reckons that he lives in metropolitan
surroundings compared with what Pitt-street,
Sydney, was when he was born there 88
years ago in a little weatherboard cottage
near the still uncovered Tank stream. At
12 years of age he started a round of the
goldfields with his father. He was 31 when
he joined the N.S.W. postal service, and the
Postal Department has been paying him a
pension for 23 years. Keif can remember
when there were beaches along Darling
Harbor and when the one at the foot of
King-street, where the Burns-Philp wharf
is now, was a favorite picnic resort. Pie
recalls how Tunks, a local cricket champion
of the day, playing on the Plyde Park wicket,
smote a ball which flew over the houses in
Elizabeth-street, and landed in Castlereagh-
street. The old man is the P M.G.’s long-
distance pensioner and looks as if he could
hold the record for many years to come.
“Yoyang” : A Bulletin paragraphist (B.
27/l/’27) deplores that our largest river
should be called the Murray instead of by
the name of Hume, who found it. But
he himself errs in writing of “Alexander”
Hume; the explorer’s name was Hamilton.
Some writers carry confusion further by
calling him John Alexander Hume, mixing
him up with his brother, John Kennedy
Hume, also an explorer, who was shot by
bushrangers at Gunning in 1840. Hum's
himself had no other Christian name than
Hamilton : he was christened and registered
in July, 1797. at Parramatta by old Sam
Marsden. And the upper part of the Mur-
ray was always called the Plume by the
residents, as the baptism in the old church
registers of the late ’forties show. So that
school atlases are not the only official pub-
lications wherein the river was called the
Plume.
Now that motor-man Milvain, who figured
in the Caulfield train smash, has been
awarded a pension of £3 a week from the
Vic. State superannuation fund, the Labor
party will have no further use for him. Mil-
vain was a convenient pawn in the political
game when the proposed tax on McShort-
odds's turnover was before the Assembly. It
was known that five or six Laborites were
favorable to the tax, and it became necessary
therefore to muddy the issue. Procedure
required that a formal motion should be
passed that the Assembly resolve itself into
committee, to consider the tax. That was
the opportunity for the tacticians. They
professed to be indignant that the House
should do anything till the grievance of the
wronged Milvain had been redressed, and so
worked up a bare majority against going into
committee on the tax. What with the sore-
ness over the redistribution of seats, it was
never safe for the much-battered Ministry
to have another shot at the impost, and so
the odds-yellers secured a respite.

Miss DOROTHY LENA, a beautiful Rexona
Girl, now playing lead in the new musical
comedy, “Tell Me More,” at Her Majesty's
Theatre, Sydney, writes: “I have found that
Rexona Soap is ideal as a Hair Shampoo and
is also particularly good for the complexion.”
Be a Rexona
Girl!
It Means Health
and Beauty.
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their
beautiful skin and hair. To be a Rexona
Girl is to use only Rexona Soap and
enjoy that natural beauty of the skin
and hair which cannot be imitated, but
can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this
influence. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the
best of such soaps can only cleanse, they
cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing,
antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer,
the value of which in the treatment of skin
affections is known throughout the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regu-
larly once or twice a day and see if it does not
quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen the
tendency to pimples and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

What a lovely
Gift! ”
Haul Away, Joe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, once I loved a Dover lass,
But she was fat and lazy;
A creole down in Callao
Next drove me nearly crazy.
Hurrah, boys! Haul away, Joe!
Haul away, me hearty bullies !
Oh, haul and haul away!
The Passion Flower from Liverpool
She sails again to-day.
We’ll raise our chanty to the skies,
Forget the wind and weather;
We’ve give the gals our fond good-byes,
So haul away together !
Haul away! Haul away, Joe!
I own I loved a nigger gal
In Appilachecola,
Until a dirty cannibal
He kem along an’ stole ’er.
Yah! Haul away, Joe,
Away, haul away, haul away, Joe.
When I was sick in New Orleans
With cussed chills and fever,
I met a yaller gal of means,
An’ swore I’d never leave her.
But I got out one sunny morn
An’ went an’ saw the master.
Said he, “Younc man, I fear yer born
For femmynine disaster.
“Oh, give this woman over, Jack,
An’ be again a sailor;
Remember you’re a rover, Jack,
If Ranzo was a tailor !”
I ups and ships with that Old Alan,
You never met a better;
We sailed next day for Sandakan —
But still I don’t forget ’er.
So yah, ha, ha ! Haul away, Joe !
Haul away quick ! Haul away slow !
Haul away, haul away, Joe!
But we got wrecked upon a shore,
One mornin’ in September,
Where clothes the natives never wore
As far as I remember.
I wore me whiskers as they grew,
For strewth ! I had no razor.
That brown Kanaka gal I knew
Too much I couldn’t praise ’er.
They built a hut for ’er and me
Upon a tropic island
That measured twenty miles by three
Of deep lagoon and dry land.
Ho, ho, ho ! Haul away. Joe!
Haul away, haul away, Joe !
Sich life them writers all aver
The only perfect bliss is :
We lived a year, did me an’ ’er,
On cocoanuts an’ kisses.
An’ then there comes a silly smoke
To wake yer ’appy dreamer.
It was the same old Sunday joke,
A blanky mission steamer !
Ah, ha, ha! Haul axoay, Joe !
Haul away quick, haul away slow!
Haul away, haul away, Joe!
They rows ashore, intent, I swear,
Some scandal for to fish un,
An’ finds us as they finds us there,
The captain an ? a bishop!
Oh, haul away, Joe!
Now don’t forget I’m tollin’ you
The truth of all me doin’s :
I’ve ’ad me weddings, one or two,
I’ve likewise ’ad me wooin’s.
Im Sailor Jack from any port
Around the seven oceans.
I likes ’em tall, I likes ’em short,
An’ them is my emotions.
Tou come to sea an’ live like me,
My pious prayin’ brother,
An’ take it rough ; an’ soon we’ll see
The streaks in one another!
Tm Sailor Jack, an’ steam or sail,
The world won’t change me, sonny.
I lose an’ gain, I win or fail,
But still I’ll spend me money
On grog an’ gals—oh, you should know
The gal I met in Dover!
Pull hard me bullies now an’ show
The clew right well an’ over.
Haul away, me hearty bullies!
Oh, haul, oh, haul away !

The Cook of the Endeavour.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘The author desires to acknowledge his indebted-
to Professor Wood’s “Voyage of the Endeavour.’’
rpHis man, my dear Doctor, hath
genius—genius of a rare and re-
markable sort. Never before, I vow
hjid declare, have I encountered his equal.
aou have tasted of his soups, his stews, his
Puddings, and the many sorts of messes he
J ath provided us with from the catches of
l he seine. Consider how well we fared at
•Aipper yestereve. A cook who could turn
hose great stingrays into such palatable
able delicacies is no common man. For my
i art, I -will not forget our last meal in
Harbor. This fish, perhaps, is not
d'jite so toothsome as a good skate, though
Tis not. much inferior. In John Thomson’s
hands it becomes a dish fit for my Lord
Mayor himself, entertaining royalty at the
Mansion House. I am sure you will agree
hath me, my dear Dr. Solander. The man
a genius.”
T 'w^ eec *' Mr. Banks, Ido agree with you.
\ haf nod his equal seen —anywhere. We
to truly owe to Thomson a debt of gratitude.
~ recall mit mine selluf those de-licious
ashes of cooked tropical fruits he served us
hath at. Otaheite. Most cerddainly—he is a
v ery prince of cooks.”
The two gentlemen had just come on deck
after breakfast on the sunny morning of May
7, 1770, as I-I.M.S. Endeavour, Lieutenant
James Cook, li.N., Commander, was making
her offing, after sailing out of Botany Bay
in further prosecution to the northward of
the great voyage that has made her famous.
The commander had remained below —
after a breakfast taken a little later than
the others, because he had been conning the
ship out of the haven where she had rested
for a week —in order to check some necessary
observations. Presently he came on deck,
and, after a quick examination of the ship’s
position, and a word or two with the helms-
man, walked for’ard of the mizzen, and
joined the two scientific gentlemen who, with
their spyglasses, were interestedly scanning
the coast.
“Well, Mr. Banks,” he remarked as he
joined the two naturalists, “we’re off again
upon our travels, hey! And may I
ask what you two gentlemen intend doing
with the mass of vegetable matter that
nigh fills the cabin? Are they to be used
as anti-scorbutics, pray? D’ye mean to hand
’em over to John Thomson for to serve up
as a dressing for our salt-junk and -pork?
Or are ye going to stuff your beds with all
those leaves and grasses? Which is it,
pray?” he asked laughingly.
Good-looking young Mr. Banks lowered
his glass and turned with a smile to the
commander of the ship.
“The Doctor here and your very humble
servant —we have just but now been sound-
ing mutual praises of your cook, the invalu-
able Thomson. Pray, will you not inform
us where on earth you were able to acquire
such a paragon? Are there many such sea-
cooks in existence?”
Cook laughed.
“Well, then, I heartily agree with you, Mr.
Banks —but ’tis no merit of mine that wo
are so fortunately provided with a cook.
’Tis, so to speak, the act of God. Their
Lordships first of all sent down to Deptford
a poor, wretched fellow —-lame and decrepit
-—who could not, by any manner of means,
have been expected to carry out his duties.
I protested—knowing something of the value
of a passable cook in such an expedition
as we were about to embark upon —and
managed, with difficulty, to get him removed.
There was a man named Pritchard whom I
knew something about—he’d been with me in
North America —whose services I was
anxious to secure. But they’d by no means
listen to me, and sent another down from
London—this man Thomson, for whom,
’twas insisted upon, I must find a place on
the muster-roll of the crew of the Endeavour.
“Some sort of influence he appeared to
have. So, being greatly worried by a multi-
plicity of vexatious matters —and perhaps a
little as the result of an attack of the spleen
—I made him cook, not knowing whether he
was capable of so much as making peasoup
—nay, even of boiling water. But, as
you see, the Fates were kind to us.
I know no more than you do, though,
where he so thoroughly learned his trade.
But why not ask him yourself? Or get
young Isaac Smith to do so? He seems to
be a silent, reserved fellow, this John Thom-
son, and I believe that the only person in
the ship with whom he is on anything like
friendly terms is Mrs. Cook’s cousin, this
young midshipman. I have observed that
young Isaac is not at all backward in culti-
vating the good graces of the cook, and have
no doubt but that the midshipmen’s mess is
the gainer by such an intimacy and friend-
ship. Ask Isaac to get his story for you, if
you want it. I suppose ’twould hardly be
seemly for Mr. Joseph Banks, of the Royal
Society, to interview the cook with regard
to his origin, and the school wherein he
learned his cunning and skill in the prepara-
tion of foodstuffs for the table. Ask young
Isaac,” he laughed as he turned to go aft.
Just abaft the foremast, on the lower deck
of the Endeavour, was situated the ship’s
galley, and in it on a mild mid-winter even-
ing John Thomson, the cook, was burnishing
his pots and pans and putting them away
in their racks and on their hooks before
suspending operations for the night. Eight
bells had not long sounded from the quarter-
deck, and it was with the consciousness of a
long day of honest craftsmanship behind him
that he tidied up his little workshop whilst
he carried on a desultory conversation with
a young and rosy-cheeked boy who sat upon
the coaming of the doorway enthusiastically
demolishing a mince-pie.
“What was that there you was a-haskin’
of, young gen’leman ?” he inquired as he
closed the drawer in the fixed table where lie
kept liis knives and forks and spoons. “What
made me for to go to sea, eh? Well, now,
young Master Hisaac, for why ’d ye be
a-wantin’ to know that? Any o’ them bug-
’unters an’ weed-scratchers in th’ cabin bin
a-puttin’ of ye hup for to try an’ pump
cookie, eh? Them fellies they wants for to
' know lieverythink.”
Mr. Midshipman Isaac Smith would never
have become an admiral had he not possessed
some latent talent for strategy and diplomacy.
He lied cheerfully, as only a healthy boy can.
“Oh no, Jack. But ye’re such a thund’rin’
good cook it seems strange to me ye’d want
to come a-boilin’ pork and beef for a hungry
lot o’ tarry-breeks when ye might ha’ been
making banquets for any o’ the nobility and
gentry in England. Wfll. I did hear Mr.
Banks, now I come to think of it, wond’ring
the same thing. But anyone ’d wonder.
What made you for to do it, cookie?”
“Ho, Mister Banks! Well, ’e can mind ’is
hown dam’ business, Mr. Joe Banks can.
Like ’is imperence, Hi calls it. Them nat’ral-
ists, they’re alw’ys a-pokin’ their flamin’ noses
inter somethink what don’t consarn ’em.
Gawd —I want a breaf o’ fresh hair, m’ lad.
I’ll go smoke a pipe on th’ fo’c’s’le-’ead. Mebbe
I’ll tell ye hall abart it. if so be ye like for
to come an’ drop anchor alongside. But
on’y for y’self, mind.”
It was a long tale, and one which even the
callow credulity of the youthful midshipman
found a little hard to swallow, but it was told
very earnestly, and there was not much doubt
that Mr. Thomson himself believed it.
Seven years before, it seemed, John Thom-
son had been a pastrycook at Bow. having
saved enough money during years of service
in the household of the Earl of Ditclifield —
at Ditchfield Hall in Hampshire, and at his
town house in Arlington-street—to set him-
self up in business.

“ ’Twas there I met her. Master Hisaac,
an’ a rare, ’ansome an’ lively piece she were
—beautiful as th’ marnin’ star, an’ smart
an’ wide-awake as one o’ them there seagulls
as follies a ship an’ misses naught as may
be dropped from th’ galley i’ tli’ way o’
scraps an’ leavin’s.”
There had been a wedding in Bow Church
—a magnificent affair in its sequel of festive
inebriation —but, unfortunately, and almost
upon his own doorstep, poor John Thomson
had been snatched from the arms of his bride
by a press-gang. And then there had been
for him three years in the Mediterranean,
wherein he achieved much glory—as a cook.
Captains had quarrelled over him ; admirals
had competed for his services. He had re-
turned to Bow when his ship paid off —and
found that his spouse was his faithful loving
wife no longer, but had become a loose
woman in the West End. He saw her once,
in company with the first lieutenant of his
last ship, painted, patched and powdered,
and very obviously just what she was.
“.... An’ so I says to Cap’ll Boulter,
says I, ‘Lookye ’ere, Cap’ll, you’re tli’ man
what done it. ’Twas y’self led ’er hastray,
w’en ye’d packed me off aboard tli’ tender be
Wapping Old Stairs. You was tli’
lootenant in charge o’ that there press that
took me on me weddiu’ day. An’ now,’ I
tells ’im, ‘ye’re a post-cap’n, an’ I’m
y'r cook —but I ain't no less a man that
don’t forget. See ye here, sir, I knows all
abart ye—all abart ’ow ye wants for to
marry tli’ Port-Hadmiral’s darter,’ I says.
‘An’ lemme tell ye, th’ day ye does it, I’m
a-goin’ for to tell tli’ lady ail abart it,’ I says.
'YTiss,’ I tells ’im—‘th’ werry day. You done
me out o' marrit ’appiness,’ I says, ‘an’ I’ll
do you.’ An’ wi’ •that ’e jumps liout of ’is
cot, an’ ’its me in tli' crimson jaw. An’ then
’e picks me hup aroun’ tli’ middle, an’ ’eaves
me through one o’ tli' starn windows of ’is
cabin. So I swum ashore, an’ landed on
Southsea ’Ard.”
“Seventeen!” cried the leadsman, and the
Endeavour took the coral reef with a bump
and a shiver, and then another bump, and
suddenly stood still, the white sails flapping
against the masts.
“Stations!” roared the officer of the watch.
The Endeavour had arrived at Batavia, after
having been miraculously saved from the
reef, and all the dangers of Torres Strait,
with all the crew in the best of health and
spirits—in notable contrast with the sickly
people into whose midst they had come. That
was on October 11. She departed on Decem-
ber 26 with nearly all her complement sick
and dying. Surgeon Monkhouse . died, Tupia
the Tahitian, whom Mi'. Banks was taking
to England—and they kept on dying, and
being buried at sea by the debilitated sur-
vivors, until 23 of them had gone overside.
Four men died one day, on the dreadful pas-
sage to the Cape of Good Hope—and amongst
them was John Tlioihson.
Gloomily and shakingly Mr. Banks stood
by the open gangway as Captain Cook read
the burial service over the bodies lying on
the grating. One by one, lashed in their ham-
mocks with a round-shot at the feet of each
of them, they were tipped into the sea. The
cook was the last to make the splash. Isaac
Smith, midshipman of the watch, stood be-
hind the captain, and blubbered miserably.
The emaciated Mr. Banks, compassionate and
sympathetic, placed his arm about the boy’s
shoulders, as they turned away towards the
quarter-deck when the ceremony was over.
“Come, come, Isaac,” he said consolingly,
"you mustn’t give way. my boy. Pray, con-
trol yourself. Poor Thomson —I know that
you and he were good friends. But he’s at
neace now. ’Tis not good for you to take on
like this. We must all keep our spirits, and
make the best of it.”
“Thankee, Mr. Banks,” answered the lad
gratefully. “I liked old Jack —he was good
to me. I was his only friend in the ship—l
do believe.”
Then Mr. Banks remembered his curiosity
concerning the dead cook.
“Did Thomson ever tell you about himself,
Isaac? You remember how the doctor and I
commissioned you to get his story for us?
How did he come to be in the ship? Did
he ever tell you?”
The boy looked up shyly into the kindly
face of the naturalist, and nodded.
“Well —and what did he tell you, pray?”
“He was telling me the night we went on
the rock, if you please, sir,” said Isaac Smith
hesitatingly. “The wreck interrupted him.”
“And did you remind him afterwards?”
“Please, sir, yes.”
“And what did he say?”
“Well, sir—well, Mr. Banks, I hardly like
to tell you. Would you mind if I was to
tell you just what old Jack said?”
“No, no —of course not, my boy. Pray,
what did John Thomson say?”
“He said —I’m sorry, Mr. Banks —he said,
‘You tell that ——- bug-hunter to mind his
own business!’ ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
shambling four, who had just been
released from the prison, were in sharp
contrast to the women warders, so
trim, so severely neat, who were, apparently
as a last act of authority, seeing that they
boarded a train.
They were a queer lot, this quartette.
Each carried a large, shapeless bundle of
belongings wrapped in newspaper, which,
torn here and there, gave glimpses of gar-
ments not meant for the public eye. Bat-
tered suitcases and a rascally-looking
umbrella with a horse’s head as handle, lay
at their feet.
The warders were concerned over one of
their charges., she being the reason, it seemed,
why they remained. This poor wreck, old,
half-demented and pallid as a corpse, kept
tapping any should.r handy and inquiring,
as if such a thing couldn’t really be: “Am
I a free woman? Am I a free woman?”
“I don’t know why she wasn't met,” said
one warder. “She is not fit to be alone.” But
again the only answer was the croaking ques-
tion, this time to another ex-prisoner. "Am
I a free woman V” "Of course you’re free,"
said the other. “We’re all free.’’ But in
that she lied unconsciously. Never were
human beings more bound. Handcuffed to
the past, they would never be free. Presently
a woman, daughter of the half-demented one,
arrived. “Sorry to be late,” she panted to
the warders. “I missed the train. Anyhow.
I’ll take her in hand now.” But this was
not so easy. The poor creature showed at
sight of her daughter a keen desire to return
to gaol, and tact was needed to quieten her.
While this was in process, the remaining
women stood aside in a battalion of three,
hugging their bundles, watching the scene
with levity, until a local constable ap-
proached, when they became as pillars of
salt, careful to give no offence, in fear
of further reprisals on the part of the law.
Their expressions were timid and uncertain
as though, in spite of sentences served, they
felt the gaol walls closing round them once
more. But he passed on. And the female
warders, too, with last admonitory words,
departed. Looking back, the women with
the bundles waved them an adieu. One, for-
getting discipline, called out “(loin’ to be
good—yous won’t see me again. Tatta ! You
betcher life they won’t,” she added to her
companions. “I’ve had enough of Hell fer
a bit.” Then, seeing the curious glances
of the genuinely-free people awaiting the
train, she lapsed to decorum.
There they stood. Three forlorn Graces,
silent, immobile, anchored to their bundles.
Yet that immobility was on the surface
only. Beneath it was a raging restlessness,
which, from long rule and regulation, had
to be stifled. They were like caged things,
who, the door being opened,, were yet afraid
to venture forth lest the door swing to and
crush them as they flew.
They fluttered, these gaol-birds, not yet
sure of escape. Once in the train, however,
with the prison turrets receding from view,
their demeanor changed. Though still fur-
tive, they became bold. Though still timid,
they became exultant. An irresponsible grin
dodged about their faces as might be seen
on truant schoolboys out for a lark.
They sat close, the clothes they wore
were very old and crumpled, and might well
have been fished from the very heart of
the bundles, so rigorously clutched on the
knee, as though to deposit them elsewhere
would be an infringement of prison rule.
Yet they were all well washed and clean,
these poor old glad rags, as were the boots
the women wore—shapeless and split and
warped, yet in a high state of polish.
The eldest of the trio was so masculine
in look that one might have expected her
to bend and strike a match on her old shoe-
leather, and restless enough to dance a break-
down in them. She seemed hungry for action
—hungry to be up and doing. Tapping
her toes, she hugged her bundle, spasmodi-
cally criticised the public with stealthy eyes,
and talked, unheeded and in patches, into
the ear of the woman next to her.
“No, Annie,” she said, “no more for mine.”
A pause while she stared at fresh passengers.
“I’m goin’ straight, I am.” Another pause
of some moment. “I'll get off at the corner
—see —an’ make a break fer tli’ old joint
—see —no more booze fer me, Annie.” Look-
ing hard at Annie’s foolish face for encour-
agement perhaps, or confirmation of her own
resolutions, and finding none, she tried to
control her jumping nerves by coughing into
her bundle. Of what use to seek inspira-
tion in Annie? As well ask the blind to
lead the blind. Annie, loose of mouth and
shifty of eye, foredoomed by Fate to crime,
hapless and hopeless product of heredity,
was incapable of leading herself. Her
glance, like that of a hunted rabbit, rested
nowhere long, but seemed ever seeking a
way out of the tangle she was in. Once
only Annie spoke, as with a move of the
elbow in the monologist’s direction slie said,
“Mag’s nutty”-—this into the ear of the third
of the graces.
This third derelict took trouble lightly.
Impudence was her keynote. She wore a
rakish look, like a last night’s wineglass
full of butts. Once, when she dropped her
apology for an umbrella, she giggled without
restraint, alluding to its equine decoration
as “Good old Cardigan.”
“Tell Rose to be’ave,” cautioned Mag
w T ith a trick of voice she had learned from
the warders; “she’ll have us copped.”
But raffish Rose was not in gaol
now and ignored the caution. In a
burst of titters she bent to recover the
umbrella and dropped a dog-eared handbag.
A shilling fell out. Upon this Mag instantly
placed her foot, hissing to its owner with
sudden ferocity “Yous owes me that.” Maybe
she was telling the truth. Raffish Rose did
not dispute the claim, for at that moment
the advent of another travelling policeman
on the rear platform froze the Three Graces
into propriety—a propriety which departed
when he did, for Rose gave vent to another
pleasantry. “They’re all over the place,
ain’t they? Must be P’liceman’s Day. Mag,
you oughta buy a button for P’liceman’s
Day.”
The train stopped at a station.
“Here’s where I get off,” said Mag, hur-
riedly putting a hand-lock on her posses-
sions. Her hard face softening, she said,
“So long, Rose. So long, Annie. Be good.
Hooroo, dearie.” and in a husky aside as
she went out, “It’s goin’ straight for me—
no more booze.”
Stepping briskly from the station Mag
found herself opposite a hotel. She passed
its portal bravely, glanced back, hesitated,
walked on a pace and vanished—into its
side door.
Mag, once some woman’s laughing baby!
At the next stop Annie of the rabbit’s
eyes started up. Without sign of farewell
to Rose she stumbled out. A thick-set man
with a jowl and a tilted hat was lounging
there. With a weak smile of propitiation
Annie sidled up to him.' lie moved not a
muscle in welcome, but turned and shuffled
away; and she, still hugging the bundle and
lugging the bag, tailed along in his wake,
like a dog behind its master.
Poor Annie!
Rose the raffish travelled with us to the
city. Arriving at Flinders-street she left
vis. and stepping jauntily away, faded into
the unknown.

THE MOST EFFICIENT MOWER ON EARTH.
UTCO
■ 1 HI MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
Smm
The “ATCO” will make a appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c.
It is fitted with a engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes. ...... . . . ...
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making this ALL-BRITISH MOWER more popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
Full stocks on hand.
PRICES:—I4in." cutters, £47/10/-; 16ih„ £57/10/-; 18in.,
£67/10/-; 22in., £B2/10/-; 24in., £9O; 30in., £llO each.
