The Brisbane “Telegraph”

The Red Page
HIS
BOOKS
Psychoanalysis in Fiction
The wonder is that Freud’s theories
haven’t been exploited more geperall
by British and American novelists wit
an eye to business. They have been sub
jects of general conversation in every
English-speaking country since “Über
Psychoanalyse” was translated nearly
quarter of a century ago. Now that there
is a tendency to be facetious about
Freud, Jung and the rest, the novelists
are taking them up. A psychoanalytical
thriller was reviewed on this Page a
few weeks ago. Of course, it isn’t the
province of an artist to psychoanalyse
his creations, apart from the fact that
in doing so he is in danger of making
his most poignant situations comic.
Unconscious humor is the bane of both
the novels discussed below ; yet they are
remarkably interesting and well written.
The Subhuman Race
Murray Constantine, author of Proud
Man (Boriswood ; 7s. 6d.), is said, by the
dust-jacket, to be “a pseudonym....
veiling the identity of a rare and mature
writing personality.” A woman pro-
bably. The central figure is an anony-
mous “human” (a single-sexed, fully-
conscious being, the natural develop-
ment of the original single-sexed, un-
conscious amoeba) who dreams back to
our present-day world of “subhumans.”
The comparison with Gulliver is in-
evitable. We find the same loathing of
mankind, the same hideous charges,
levelled with the same cool detachment
in the same Biblically unadjectival
language. But whereas the voice of
Gulliver was the voice of Swift, an
aggressive male, this voice is feminine.
The owner despises us, but above all
she despises men. Her sex-antagonism
betrays her now and then into over-
statements which detract from the value
of the indictment. Swift, for example,
wouldn’t have weakened his case by
stating that all the undergraduates of an
English university were either homo-
sexual or heterosexual. Where she
doesn’t exaggerate she says nothing—
about sex, marriage, divorce, fashions in
clothes, crime, war, empire-building,
religion, sport—that hasn’t been said a
thousand times before ; but her vast case
for the prosecution is presented with un-
usual clarity. She views our world from
three vantage points. First as the pro-
tegee of a saintly old clergyman who
teaches her English, and gives her money
whAi they separate; next as the com-
panion of a woman-novelist; finally, as
the companion of a young man. By the
time she meets the young man she has
exhausted her subjects for social criti-
cism. This episode is the most dramatic
of the three, but one gets a disconcert-
ing impression that it has been dragged
in to make up the usual three hundred
and odd pages. Here man is no longer
proud, but abject and altogether pitiable.
When she meets Gilbert he has mur-
dered two little girls.
With Gilbert the blood sacrifice, though
giving him sexual ease, bound upon his
conscience a load of guilt intolerable by
subhuman nature, so that he must have
ever more blood, and better quality blood,
and longer and brighter periods of sexual
ease, to enable him to carry his guilt.
His mother used to have fits, and when
he was three he saw her in one. The
cure was to cut down a certain tree out-
side her room.
He had identified the tree with his dark
trouble, and the house with his reason.
If the tree fell into the house he must go
mad, but if it fell straight, leaving the
house clear, there was hope for him.
CEdipus Complex
Duologue, by Joan Temple (Elkin
Mathews and Marrot; Bs. 6d.), contains
all the popular ingredients—romance,
religion, humor, social satire and plain
speaking —but primarily it is a study of
the Rev. Thomas Smith’s complexes. He
has an exceptionally full equipment. We
meet him at Malham (a south-west
London suburb which resembles Balham)
to Canon Dur-
ville. He had
been a master at
a minor public
school, where he
gave a boy an un-
merciful thrash-
ing. He had liked the boy, but Dr. Riscoe,
a young g.p. whom he meets at Malham,
tells him that his affection was of a per-
verted nature. Dr. Riscoe is a typical
amateur psychoanalyst: he sees com-
plexes everywhere. When the Rev.
Thomas begins working miracles the
Canon is annoyed.
“I should be glad to hear [says a
parishioner) why you think Canon
Durville is unwilling for Mr. Smith to go
on visiting Mr. Catro.”
Dr. Riscoe thrust out his jaw as though
expecting and welcoming combat.
“In my opinion, Durville is an exhibition-
ist. The word explains itself, doesn't it —
even if you don’t go in for psycho-
analysis?”
Sex repression is the explanation of the
curate’s miraculous powers. Many
saints, Christian and otherwise, were
able to perform similar tricks because
with them sex had been transferred to
the mental plane.; made a cerebral as
well as a physical force. A dean who
has been psychoanalysed by Riscoe
develops the theory for the benefit of
Thomas.
“Has it ever struck you that St. Paul,
by modern psychological standards, might
possibly be regarded as having been both
an introvert and a sadist?”
“A sadist? I’m- not quite sure that I see
that, sir.”
“ ‘And I persecuted this way unto
death.’ A strange, introverted violent
man.”
Thomas, like the young man in the other
book, is suffering from a mother-
fixation. The happy ending arrives
when, owing to Dr. Riscoe’s treatment,
the bedevilled divine, who has suc-
ceeded the Canon as rector of Malham,
is able to enter into the married state
relieved of his complexes, but ipso facto
relieved of the power to heal the sick.
An irritating feature is the author's
habit of using words out of their specific
meaning. When Canon Durville is diag-
nosed as an exhibitionist the doctor
doesn’t mean that he is a police-court
case, merely a sufferer from vanity and
jealousy. “Heterosexuality” in Proud Man
is a morbid condition ; here it is normal.
And so on. The principals are bores.
The doctor has a fixed idea, and, like a
proselytising atheist, Fascist or Douglas
Crediter, he can’t stop talking about it.
Thomas is a ninny, with no ideas at all,
who submits to being lectured by every-
body ; and Rosalind, who refuses to be-
come engaged to him because of his
lack of pre-marital experience, is a prig.
But some of the minor characters, such
as Lord Lashminster, the Canon and the
Mallock boys, are surprisingly well
done; and the atmosphere of a churchy
London suburb is created at once and
consistently preserved.

Australian Defence
The Price of Peace, by W. M. Hughes
(William Brooks and Co.), contains very
little rhetoric. Facts are always more
satisfying than fancy, and they are
mobilised with deadly-effect in this 100-
page book.
We have no fleet capable of offering an
enemy serious resistance; no air force
comparable to that which he could bring
against us; no land defence that could
hold him at bay.
In the past Australia was safe if only
because the British Navy was unchal-
lengeable: according to “Jane’s Fighting
Ships,” “the British Navy is now unable
even to guarantee Britain’s food supplies.”
On one side of the North Pacific we are
confronted by America with 15 battleships
and 20 modern cruisers, and on the other
by Japan with nine super-dreadnoughts
and 27 cruisers. Japan is about to in-
crease its naval strength “to a substantial
extent” ; the U.S.A., according to a recent
“S. M. Herald” report, quoted from the
Manchester “Guardian,” “is now em-
barked upon the largest naval building
programme since the World War.”
The League of Nations is an admitted
failure as an averter of war. It couldn’t
even prevent or stop war between two
minor South American States which were

AMAZING NEW TREATMENT
■■ ROOTS OUT
CATARRH
THOUSANDS REPORT AMAZING
RESULTS IN CATARRH, MUCOUS
DISCHARGES, STUFFINESS,
HEADACHES, SPITTING, HEAD
NOISES, BAD BREATH,
WEAKNESS, LOSS OF VITALITY,
DEAFNESS, ETC
Catarrh sufferers in
Europe and America have
been thrilled by the new
treatment developed by a
Swiss Research Scientist.
Most wonderful results
have been obtained by this
new Catarrh therapy,
which is the result of over
25 years’ intensive re-
search. It has been esti-
mated that this home
method has been success-
fully used by over 200,000
people i n Europe and
America. It has the en-
dorsement of physicians,
ost e o paths, specialists,
health educators and even
the great European Sana-
toriums. The importance
of this new treatment to
millions of Catarrh suf-
ferers can hardly be over-
estimated.
UNLIKE ANY OTHER
TREATMENT—HELPS THE
WORST CASES
The reason why this treatment works
such wonders is because it is a
NATURAL METHOD. The Scientist
discovered that Catarrh is a disease
of the blood and that its REAL or
BASIC CAUSE arises from abnormal
conditions present in the body of the
sufferer, and NOT from climatic
conditions. He asserts that inhala-
tions, douches, sprays, injections,
etc., which treat the symptoms only,
cannot clear away Catarrh. His new
method is totally different—different
in conception, different in principle
—and different in results. It acts to
overcome the BASIC CAUSE of
Catarrh. It goes directly to the blood
stream, purifying it of all catarrhal
and other poisons. Pure blood means
vigour, vitality, healthy tissues and
freedom from the grip of Catarrh.
NO HABIT-FORMING DRUGS—
NO SPRAYS OR DOUCHES
This marvellous new home hygiene
does away with sprays, douches, ex-
pensive injections, serums, vaccines,
etc. It is easy to follow. You can
use it in the comfort and privacy of
your own home —or even room,
without losing an hour from your
work or a shilling from your income.
No matter how deep-seated or how
long-standing your case, you owe it
to yourself to learn all about this
astounding new home method, which
has helped some of the worst cases
known to medical science.
NEW HOPE FOR SUFFERERS
Even children and elderly people in
the most weakened condition find
this natural system wonderfully
soothing and healing. Results are
noticed in a few short days—clearer
head, clearer skin, new vigour and
vitality, freedom from headaches,
dizziness, continuous hawking and
spitting, huskiness, offensive breath
and body odour. As the treatment
progresses, so the head noises become
less and the hearing becomes more
acute. Dullness, depression, exhaus-
tion and despondency give place to a
new feeling of power and vitality.
And this amazing new method is now
offered to sufferers under the liberal
contract feel better in 7 days or
money refunded.

League members. The recognition of
this truth on the part of all the nations
—those who have something to defend,
and are in consequence pacifist, equally
with those who have something to get,
or get back, and are in consequence mili-
tarist—has led to the rearmament move-
ment which has inspired so many books
like The Price of Peace of late. Britain
has just decided to increase the strength
of the R.A.F. during the coming five
years by 41 squadrons. Mr. Hughes
considers that Australia should follow
suit. He believes in a strengthened navy
and land forces, but
It is on air defence that we must con-
centrate. A strong air force is within
our resources, no matter how conserva-
tively these may be estimated. There is
no reason why Australia should not have
an air force so strong as not only to
overwhelm an enemy aircraft, to destroy
all transports, ’plane-carriers and supply
ships accompanying the fleet, but also to
gravely imperil, if not destroy, his armed
vessels.
Mr. Hughes can write with authority
on Australian Defence. It is the one
political policy on which he has been
consistent for quarter of a cen-
tury ; and he knows war and Europe.
So in The Price of Peace we don’t find
any fireworks; merely a collection of
plain statements which are as irrefutable
as the Federal Labor party’s arguments
for an Australian Navy were in the first
decade of Federation.

The Complete Works of H. P.
Blavatsky, edited by A. Trevor Barker

6d.).
The first of these books appears to
me to be pure bunkum. The source
of the author’s information is, of
course, India. In that demented
land Yoga has flourished for upwards
of 40 centuries. It has to-day more
practitioners than chiropractic, osteo-
pathy, philately and Rotary put to-
gether. Its adherents constitute a
major unemployment problem. Present
writer has seen herds of yogis sitting by
the road in dirty linen or no linen what-
ever, with their begging bowls beside
them, contemplating the Absolute or
their alter ego or the infra-astral plane,
or possibly wondering where their next
meal is to come from. .Some of them,
it is reported on insufficient evidence,
have entered dead bodies, been buried
in the earth and disinterred months after-
wards in a perfect state of preservation
and in the same stage of mental develop-
ment as when they were buried. They
can walk on water, thorns and sword-
blades, and leave life and return to it.
They achieve these miracles by gazing
fixedly at their navels or the tips of their
noses ; and the same exercises also pro-
vide them with the key to all knowledge.
With so much wisdom available, the
results to India ought to be more appar-
ent. Yet that country has not produced
one individual of really first-rate quality,
except, perhaps, Buddha.
Although our Indian brother can
allegedly rid his physical body of terres-
trial errors and frailties, he cannot rid it
of malaria, typhoid fever, cholera or
appendicitis. It is strange that, although
he has the assistance of a host of all-
wise yogis, the Indian remains bound to
a social system which is a mass of vulgar
snobberies ; that he subscribes to a regi-
ment of religions which are a clotted
heap of dangerous superstitions, and that
his normal way of thought is to hate and
despise his neighbor and fall on him with
a club when the British constabulary
isn’t watching.
Although the land is cluttered up with
yogis who have the gift of prophecy, no
Indian foretold, except in a vague meta-
physical fashion, radio, the aeroplane or
the Darwinian theory of evolution. In
other words, the Indian yogi, in any
Western concept of wisdom, is an im-
postor.
Nevertheless, the philosophy of the
East has penetrated to the West in enor-
mous quantities. The bookstalls are
cluttered with works on the subject.
They all give the same effect of some-
thing second-hand, woolly and essentially
humorless, and Mr. Guyot’s book is no
exception.
Mme. Blavatsky’s work, which is in
eight fat volumes, is in a different
category. It comprises all her writings,
down to three-line comments, which are
scattered through the magazines and
newspapers of three continents in Eng-
lish, French, Russian and Italian, and
were poured out at white heat from her
pen from her first contact with the
spiritualists of America in 1874 to her
death in 1891. Most of them are
ephemiridse, but they reveal a vigorous
and engaging personality, an astonish-
ingly diversified culture, a shrewd sense,
except when she was dealing with the
occult, and a profound and unusual
learning. She must have been a thorn
in the side of British officialdom in
India. She trounced the missionaries,
made hay of the conventional ritualism
of the clergy, and when any layman
criticised theosophy on insufficient data
she promptly floored him. On the other
hand, her faith obliged her to accept
any cock-and-bull story that any marvel-
worker of the East told her, and her
writings are strewn with evidences of a
truly astonishing credulity. However,
she was a valuable antidote to the
rationalistic science of the period which
optimistically believed that it had found
the final and complete key to knowledge.
The collection was a labor of love for
several students, who took seven years
to unearth and transcribe it.
M. G. SKIPPER.
Australian Taste
I would like to feel that every Aus-
tralian of intelligence was going to read
English in Australia, by E. G. Biaggini.
It has been published by the Melbourne
University Press in association with the
Oxford University Press. I wrestled with
the conclusions it draws for days in an
effort to escape them ; but as far as I
can see they are inescapable. On Mr.
Biaggini’s showing we are producing a
population composed largely of semi-
imbeciles.
He gave a series of tests to students in
the commerce and English schools of
Adelaide University, teachers-in-training
and boys at one of the public-school
colleges. They were handed extracts
from different writers, and asked to
choose between them and to give reasons
for their preferences.
For example, he offered for compari-
son passages from Bunyan and from
Elmer Gantry’s sermon. The point to
notice is that the Gantry sermon is a
parody of the most vicious utterances of
the most vicious sort of religious mounte-
bank. Bunyan was a great literary artist,
with the clear style which follows clear
thinking. Forty-nine out of 84 first-year
commerce students voted for Gantry ; 13
out of 46 second-year commerce
students, 12 out of 34 teachers-in-train-
ing, 3 out of 15 second-year students of
English and 11 out of 21 schoolboys.
Some who spotted the grossness of
Gantry were blind to hardly less dread-
ful matter in other passages.
Taken together, the experiments reveal
an acquired tendency towards mental in-
coherence, bargain-counter emotions,
affectations and artificialities. I say an
acquired tendency, because I do not
believe that any natural mind, if it had
not been subjected to a process of dis-
tortion and perversion, could prefer
Gantry to Bunyan. The maturing mind
is nowadays under terrific pressure from
the popular press, the cinema, the broad-
casters, the advertising specialists; and
the standards of the press, the cinema,
the broadcasters and some advertisers
(more particularly movie advertisers) are
about as low as they could be. As
Dr. Leavis has said in his foreword: “If
the inculcation of these standards is not
resisted by systematic training, then we
must acquiesce in the complete loss of
our cultural heritage.”
(I glance quite casually at to-day’s
newspaper lying by me and read: “A
Thunderbolt Crashes to the Screen.
Thrills that will tingle every nerve in
your body—Drama that will hit your
heart like a sledgehammer—Romance
that will plumb the depths of your emo-
tions.” And the piece could be matched
or excelled almost any day.)
The educational system is clearly fail-
ing, and it is failing because a particu-
larly foul mercantilism prevails against
every sane human value. Here and there
an inspired teacher may do something
for individuals: it is notable that the
results among second-year commerce
students and third-year English students
are markedly better than among their
juniors, and the standard of teaching and
environment at the boys’ school are
obviously superior to those of the schools
from which most of the other examinees
originally came. But a handful of
devoted men cannot stem a flood if the
flood is driven on by all the resources of
vast and wealthy interests.

“A Book and a Bittock”
The calibre of a book (and, for that
matter, of a man or a beast) may be
gauged by the calibre of its enemies
rather than of its friends. And of enemies
we may rely on Brian Penton’s Land-
takers making plenty.
The acrid stench of blood and sweat
and tears that floats up in a pungent
wave with the turning of almost every
page is the acrid stench of real blood,
real sweat, real tears. The unlovely and
unlikeable characters in which the book
abounds all matter, all achieve to vary-
ing degrees of significance, because there
is that in them that is the very breath of
life.
Cabell, one part nigh-legendary figure
to nine parts C3-class hero; Gursey,
whose “fiery little eyes flickered in
their deep sockets like beetles burrow-
ing into his skull” ; Cranky Tom, of the
whiskers suggesting that “a fine bird had
folded its wings over his face” ; Sambo,
whose teeth “were like little black ticks
eating into his gums"; Darvall;
McGovern —they are all so vital that as
they make their entrances and exits there
are occasions when an absent-minded
“Good-day” or “So long” may fall quite
easily from the lips.
But if the characterisation is a triumph,
a greater triumph still, perhaps, is the
depicture of the Australian bush. We who
have known it, here once more see it,
and smell it, and hear it again in in-
numerable aromatic and necromantic
phrases. We know it all —its “thunder,
like a soft bouncing ball rolling about
among the hills”; its “clouds. ... ribbed
with lightning that burned for seconds
long on the air—like eagles flying up into
the stars” ; its “rain, hissing in the trees
like water on fire” ; its “sky, a dome of
bone” ; its wind, “passing over a box-
wood scrub and turning up the white
underside of the leaves so that they
seemed suddenly to burst into flower” ;
its “parakeets, like ripe fruit falling from
the sky.” And then the infinite peril
and seduction of its beauty, the infinite
savagery of its heart, the infinite tyranny
of its dominion. Yet Cabell was right.
“It can be rich when it likes.”
This book, too, can be rich when it
likes. It can do for some of us what
the moon on that lost night did for
Cabell. But if you have a sweet cul-
tural tooth, if your taste in reading matter
runs to “nice” books and “comfortable”
books, leave Landtakers alone.

A Satchel of Books
The Dramatists’ Club, Melbourne, has
published a book af eight one-acters by
Australians to celebrate the centenary.
It comprises four Victorian, two N.S.W.
and two Westralian examples ; and play-
wrights include Mrs. Drake-Brockman,
Marjorie McLeod, Lloyd Ross and
Doris Hayball. The work is priced at
6s. in cloth covers and 4s. 6d. in card-
board, and is obtainable from the club at
Room 14, Third Floor, Nicholas Build-
ings, Swanston-street.
If Cal Norton hadn’t been so Lard-
headed and had let his son George lead
a bunch of gun-fighters against the
rustlers, Robert Ames Bennett’s Raiding
Rustlers (Wild West Club ; 7s. 6d.) would
have arrived at the happy ending much
sooner. As it is, Jaqueline’s father is
lynched, a dozen or so more are killed in
various ways and George is forced to
join up with Black Sam Hilk and help
rustle his father’s stock before the busi-
ness is cleared up.
And Quiet Flows the Don, by Mikhail
Sholokhov, translated from the Russian
by Stephen Garry (Putnam ; Rawson’s,
Melb.; 7s. 6d.). In 750 pages, this lead-
ing Soviet writer gives the history of a
Cossack tribe during the Great War and
in the Revolution. He has told an in-
teresting story, and told it well, though
without great psychological insight or
depth of perspective. London critics
have praised the work in extravagant
terms ; one prefers it to Tolstoy’s “War
and Peace.” Even to compare them is
ridiculous.
Silver Platter, by Laetitia McDonald
(Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.). The
principals are: Victoria Rupp, 22 or
23, good-looking, daughter of wealthy
plumber, heroine; Philip Pyne, hand-
some son of aristocratic but hard-up
Long Island family, plays a good
game of polo, marries Victoria ; Helen
Dewer, gay, sophisticated, loves and
is loved by Philip; Milton Dewer,
her husband, successful, a vulgarian,
but “once he’s past the pawing stage he’s
very nice”; Carter Logan, Victoria’s
papa’s lawyer, strong, honest, hero ; and
his wife Amy, common and too old for
him. The setting is Long Island —Holly-
wood’s Long Island, where life is one
long binge—during the boom before the
’29 slump. Victoria loses her first baby
through Philip keeping her out at a party
all night; the second is Carter Logan’s.
At the finish they’re all preparing to re-
arrange matters at Reno.
The Master Musicians series (J. M.
Dent and Sons ; 4s. 6d. per vol.), which
comprises some of the best biographies
in English of the great composers, is
being reissued under the editorship of
Eric Blom. Four of the new volumes are
to hand —Brahms, Bach, Beethoven and
Haydn. The Beethoven is a new bio-
graphy, by Marion M. Scott. It deals
chattily, but not too briefly, with the life
of the composer, and devotes a great deal
of space to a well-informed analysis of
his greater works. In this, as in the other
volumes, there is a full list of composi-
tions and a bibliography—useful features
which have been brought right up to
date. The format of the new edition is
much plainer than that of the old, but
the illustrations are better, and revision
and correction have been thorough.
The Return of the Rancher, by Frank
Austin ( The Bodley Head ; 7s. 6d.), is a
western with some unusual characters.
The heroine is a masterpiece of inanity.
The reformed ex-convict hero, who is
filled so full of lead that “another
bullet wouldn’ matter,” gets his deserts
when the lady simpers “yes” in the last
paragraph.

REPRESENTATIVES OR
ROBOTS?
To the Australian Labor-socialist politi-
cian all opponents are “Tories.” Inas-
much as he stands for the extension of
the power of the State over the individual
and would set up an aristocracy (of
trade-unionists), he is a Tory himself;
but he chooses to ignore the fact, if it
ever dawns on him. Of course, a large
proportion of those at whom he hurls
the designation are Tories. There are
not many real democrats about, and
few are to be found in our Parliaments.
The Commonwealth could do with
more “Tories” like Edward M'itchell,
K.C. This eminent Victorian is a great
champion of the financial agreement,
which so many “democrats” assail. He
refers to its acceptance by the electors of
every State as an outstanding example of
the good sense of the Australian people
and of their capacity to decide issues
which baffle the politicians. He has
given additional evidence of his belief in
government by the people for the people
by holding up the hands of the Vic-
torian Country-party members who are
resisting the tyranny of their Central
Council. He has advised them that a
member of Parliament “has accepted a
trust towards the public,” and that if, at
the dictation of any Central Council or
Inner Group, he enters into a bond that
he will vote this or that way, or do this
thing or suffer that, it amounts to
“criminal conspiracy.”
It was time some representative man
spoke out loudly and boldly against the
despotism of the machines. The Country
party was welcomed by many who had
little use for sectionalism because it
seemed to be an organised protest against
the pre-selection swindles of older par-
ties. It has not altogether lost this
character in other States, but in Vic-
toria its headquarters staff has copied all
the worst features of the A.L.P. machine,
with a rancid provincialism added. Its
Central Council, composed of individuals
unknown to 95 p.c. of Victorians, de-
mands the most abject submission from
members elected to serve the people, and
when Dr. Harris, M.L.C., refused to
grovel he was expelled. In the case of
the Commonwealth members it de-
manded a signed undertaking that they
would:
(1) Retire from the field if not “en-
dorsed” ;
(2) Advocate not only the party’s plat-
form and policy but “any alterations or
additions” that might be made to it;
(3) Vote in Parliament as the majority
of Caucus decided, even on questions
outside the platform and policy;
(4) Refuse office in any Government,
whatever the emergency, “unless same is
sanctioned by Central Council,” and
(5) Retire at the end of their terms if
they failed to “submit” their names for en-
dorsement or pre-selection.
Considering the insignificance of the
concern presenting this ultimatum, it is
probably the most arrogant example of
bossism on record ; but it differs from
other local examples only in degree.
Political crimes are committed in
the name of “discipline” by all our parties.
They all have their pre-selection devices
which are so many outrages on democ-
racy, and the controllers of the machines
have their pets as well as their dummies.
The more obsequious a member is the
more he appeals to them. For him to
hold opinions which are, or seem to be,
unpopular at the moment is an unpar-
donable sin. Thus we find Senator Kings-
mill deprived of the Nationalist nomina-
tion in Westralia because he is a Com-
monwealth man and only secessionists
are wanted. He has been President of
the Westralian Legislative Council as
well as President of the Senate, and dur-
ing a public career of 37 years no dis-
honorable act has ever been imputed to
him, but at “a poorly attended meeting”
of the National party council in Perth
(the quoted words are those of a seces-
sionist who was after a nomination him-
self) his name was struck off the list. He
wasn’t even asked to attend and put his
case. So, though 70,606 electors voted for
the maintenance of the Commonwealth
at the secesh referendum, only secession-
ists are to figure on the Nat.-C.P. ticket
for the Senate.
In New South Wales we have the
spectacle of one party thrusting on its
followers as candidates for the Senate
an exhausted ancient and two dull dema-
gogues. Another party demands U.A.P.
support for a former Laborite who,
before starting out on his campaign,
joined with his old pals to emasculate
the most important piece of legislation
the State U.A.P. Government has
brought down this session, and for a
fair-weather politician who is running
away from the seat in the House held
for many years by Elliott Johnson.
Machine control keeps good men out
of Parliament. They are too proud to
court the favor of the bosses at head-
quarters, or too sensitive to tout for votes
among local cliques. Yet bosses and
cliques can be successfully defied, as
Mr. Latham showed when he stood
against the “selected” Nationalist candi-
date for Kooyong in 1922. Victorian
Minister Kent Hughes also “bucked the
machine” and beat it, and so did Dr.
Evatt, now on the High Court Bench.
Dr. Evatt said on that occasion that pre-
selection should be added to the list of
unlawful things.
In Tasmania the parties have done
away with pre-selection, with excellent
results. For Denison even the Labor
party, which still exacts a pledge from its
members, is nominating five candidates.
It recognises that, where effective voting
obtains, a party gains by running several
aspirants to a seat, instead of invidiously
rejecting the claims of all but one ; the
public certainly gains. On the mainland
the tendency is to force the electors to
choose between Cipher (U.A.P.) and Dudd
(Lab.). Hence, among other things,
midnight salary grabs and the scattering
of public money among clamorous sec-
tions. Parliaments become crowded
with dummies and robots; elections
degenerate into bribery competitions
rather than contests of principles.
AUSTRIA AGAIN.
After years of continual contest with
his enemies—first Socialists, then Nazis
—Dollfuss is dead, shot like a dog in his
own Chancellery. Had the assassins
chosen for their victim the determined
Fey or the picturesque Starhemberg,
descendant of the saviour of Vienna
from the Turks, their deed would not
seem so foul. There is something to send
a thrill of horror through the world in
the thought of Dollfuss, a tiny, devout
man of simple rural tastes, bleeding to
death in agony, denied a doctor and a
priest.
Austrian Nazis assassinated him, but
German Nazis were parties to the crime.
For 15 months they have been fomenting
revolution in Austria in their clumsy
fashion. In March, 1933, their “Vol-
kische Beobachter” declared that Nazi-
ism had become “the foundation of the
thought of 80,000,000 Germans.” In April
the German Reichminister for Justice
and his colleague, Dr. Frank, made an
excursion to Vienna, following an in-
sulting speech by the latter aimed at Dr.
Dollfuss. Told that he was not welcome,
Dr. Frank said on Austrian soil that he
would report what had happened to Herr
Hitler, who would “presently come him-
self to deal with the situation.”
In June last year the Austrian Nazis
resorted to open terrorism. Dr. Steidle,
leader of the Tyrolese Heimwehr, was
dangerously wounded ; an attempt was
made on the life of Dr. Rintelen, Gov-
ernor of Styria, since a traitor and a
suicide ; explosives were found planted in
the sewers of Vienna. The Government
seized 170 Nazi headquarters and
arrested Nazi leaders, among them a
member of the German Reichstag, one
Habicht, self-described as “Nazi State
Inspector for Austria.” Hitler ’planes
dropped printed propaganda, in which
“Dollfuss and his accomplices in the pay
of international Jewry” were mentioned,
on Austrian soil. From a microphone in
Munich Habicht abused Dollfuss and
extolled Hitler, apparently with full
German official sanction. A plot for
the recruitment of legionaries to invade
Austria was exposed.
In August last a crisis seemed immi-
nent. Perhaps it was averted only by the
attitude of Mussolini after a meeting
with the little Austrian Chancellor on a
yacht off Riccione, near Rimini. At a
previous conference in Rome the Duce
had toasted the future of the Austrian
Republic, and all Europe believed that
Italy would never stand by and see
Pickelhauben outside Trieste.
There was to have been another
friendly talk in a few days at Riccione.
The Chancellor’s wife and children waited
for him at Mussolini’s villa. They waited
in vain. Dollfuss is dead, but his assas-
sins have gained nothing. The Govern-
ment is in the hands of Starhemberg, Fey
and the hard-headed young Tyrolese
lawyer Dr. Schuhschnigg, as resolute a
foe of Hitlerism as Dollfuss. The world
has been roused to indignation, and all
Protestants beyond Naziland agree with
the Pope that the gangster crime at the
Chancellery was a “bloody and damn-
able act, deliberately encouraged in a
spirit of hate.”
It is a trifle over 20 years since an-
other Austrian ruler was assassinated;
and just 20 years since the blond beast
broke loose and challenged civilisation.
In the light of what has happened in
Germany this last month, and in Aus-
tria this last week, is there anyone fool
enough to maintain that the British Com-
monwealth of Nations could have
escaped the fury of the blond beast by
letting him tear up the scrap of paper, and
saved itself by keeping out of the war?
It saved itself by its exertions, as it must
always be prepared to do if it is to last.
But for the valor of its sons Australia
might now be the prize of conquerors
who regard assassination as a political
weapon and agitation as a thing to be re-
pressed by shooting without trial.
“WHO SMASHES BANKS?"
A few thousand N. S. Wales people
spent a pleasant Sunday evening listen-
ing to Mr. J. T. Lang railing at “the
banks” —those nefarious institutions in
which Mr. J. T. Lang keeps his private
and business accounts and kept the
N.S.W. Government accounts when he
was Treasurer. His “chat,” as he called
it, was addressed to the unemployed ; but
as wireless sets and licenses are beyond
their means the unemployed did not
hear it. Having unmasked the foul con-
spiracies in which his bankers are en-
gaged, he came to his 1934 pre-election
explanation of the fall of the N.S.W.
Government Savings Bank during his
own disastrous reign.
The 1934 pre-election version is that
the smash—engineered, of course, by
“the banking ring” and the Nationalists
—was “due to an eighteen-months-long
run” during which millions were with-
drawn, “comprising for the most part
the money of large depositors.”, The
coup de grace was given by the Com-
monwealth Bank Board, which refused
to relieve Mr. J. T. Lang of a burden
and accept the consequences of the worst
of his follies and blunders the moment
he implored it to do so.
Why “large depositors” did not stam-
pede from the Commonwealth Savings
Bank the historian did not explain.
Neither did he mention that he himself
was responsible for the introduction of
“large depositors” to the bank in which
accounts were “guaranteed by the Gov-
ernment,” under a bill introduced by him
as Treasurer in 1920. He did it with
much palaver about “increasing the liquid
reserves 20 p.c. so as to support the
savings of widows and children.” When
somebody opposed the scheme he said
he was “shocked.” It was not a device
of the Savings Bank Commissioners ; it
had been minted in his own experienced
banking brain.
It must be remembered that the Com-
missioners are conservative about the
policy of increasing deposits, as they do
not want to encourage too many large de-
posits. They want to have them steadied
up so that at any time when a panic or
financial crisis occurs they will not have
many of those large amounts at call.
An Hon. Member: Then why increase
the amounts?
Mr. Lang: It is essential in the present
financial position of Australia. The Com-
monwealth Savings Bank has increased its
limit from £3OO to £l3OO, and we are
proposing to go to £1000.... I did not
introduce this measure without serious con-
sideration .... We are not doing anything
out of the ordinary in doing this.
Exactly what the Commissioners feared
came to pass. A. W. Turner, who was
a Commissioner for three years (1928-31),
has expressed the tragic truth in a few
pithy sentences:
The withdrawals which ultimately ex-
hausted the bank’s cash reserves (great as
they were) were caused in the first place
by fears of Government interference with
the management of the funds of the bank,
and later by knowledge that the Lang
Government had not met certain of its
obligations to the bank. Depositors of
all classes were concerned, and the appre-
hension was State-wide. It was futile to
say the fears were groundless. They
were real and alarming. The wind of
suspicion was sown. Many facts encouraged
its growth, and in due course the whirl-
wind was reaped. During the depression
only two banks have suspended payment.
Both were in N.S.W., and both closed
their doors within less than 10 months of
the Lang Government’s coming into power.
The “obligations” which Mr. Lang did
not meet consisted of interest, maturing
deposits and money held at call, and
amounted to £2,600,000. In the mean-
time, his Government defaulted in in-
terest payments on British (but not on
U.S.A.) debts. He had proposed to
his fellow-Premiers that he and they “pay
no further interest to British bondholders
until Britain has dealt with the Australian
overseas debt in the same manner as she
settled her own foreign debt with
America,” and intimated that this would
be«his Government’s policy, whether the
sister-Governments followed it or not.
He had introduced a Reduction of In-
terest Act, applicable to the Government’s
debt to the Savings Bank. These crazy
and dishonest proceedings, which were
accompanied by a running fire of abuse
of bondholders, started the stampede
which ended in the smash.
It is a never-to-be-forgotten warning
of the mischief that a reckless dema-
gogue can cause, and of the ruin that lies
in political control of banking. Yet the
arch-wrecker evidently believes that it
has been forgotten. He is asking the,
people to put his crowd in control of the
whole banking system on the strength of
his record!
MEDDLING AND MUDDLING.
A source of endless confusion and ill-
feeling in N. S. Wales is the existence
of a Ministry for Local Government.
No other State has one. The department
might function satisfactorily if it were
staffed by experts, but it isn’t. Never a
week goes by but there is a row between
it and some infuriated council—mostly
over an interpretation of the Local Gov-
ernment Act. One is raging between the
Mayor of Woollahra (Mr. Latimer,
M. and the Minister (Mr. Spooner)
over a private inquiry instituted by the
department into the imperishable Wool-
lahra incinerator question. The council
says there is no authority in the Act for
such an inquiry ; and lawyers who have
examined the Act say the council is right.
The department rules the councils to
a great extent by the good old method
of rescript and prescription. This
method worked under absolute monarchs
because it was difficult, if not impos-
sible, for those affected to criticise the
ukases of their masters. The N. S.
Wales tyranny is a shandygaff affair
that satisfies nobody. New Ordinance
No. 23 (relating to contracts), which
was disallowed by 30 votes to 12 in the
Leg. Council on Thursday night, is a
case in point. It contained the most
fantastic contradictions. Under Clause 5
a council before entering into a contract
“worth £5O to £200” would have been
required to “obtain tenders from at least
three reputable bodies.” Someone pointed
out that this would have debarred a
council from buying a specific piece of
land: there could be only one tenderer.
Another regulation (Clauses 5e and 6e)
allowed N. S. Wales councils to advertise
in the “Herald,” the “Telegraph” or the
“Labor Daily,” but not in the “Sun.”
The explanation of such insanities,
which could literally be quoted by the
yard, is that the departmentalists who
draft most of the regulations (often
without any assistance from a Parlia-
mentary draughtsman) are ignorant of
local-government matters, as well as of
legal phraseology. The councils, which,
to do them justice, are largely composed
of men who have studied local govern-
ment, know this, and it annoys them.
Further, they see in the institution which
presumes to boss them a monument of
mismanagement judged by the standards
of any decently-conducted municipality.
Parliament
Takes money collected for one purpose
and without authority applies it to other
purposes.
Never balances its income and expendi-
ture.
Borrows and makes no provision for
repayment.
Appoints highly-paid public officials
without calling for applications by adver-
tisement.
Because of such practices its financial
position is far worse than that of almost
any council. The greatest burdens that
N. S. Wales carries are the huge debt
and the ever-growing staff of civil ser-
vants that its Parliament has forced on
it. It is therefore undesirable that
Parliamentarians should continually
grab fresh powers, which always mean
fresh chances to waste the taxpayers’
money. They should rather divest them-
selves of many of the powers they now
possess. Local government provides an
outstanding opportunity.
If a council prsves itself to be hope-
lessly incompetent, or extravagant, or
corrupt, it is only right that it should be
removed. But if its affairs have been
conspicuously well administered, as is the
case with Woollahra, Parliament should
refrain from butting into its affairs. The
superfluous Ministry has been to blame
for four-fifths of the trouble in N. S.
Wales local-government circles of late
years ; and the position is no better under
Stevens than it was under Lang.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Pre-election Budget.
All politicians and newspapers favor-
able to the Commonwealth Government
are pleased with Mr. Lyons’s Budget.
One of the newspapers praises him for
his stern avoidance of window-dressing.
Mr. Scullin, Mr. Lang, Mr. Beasley and
the Labor press are not amused.
Dr. Earle Page “congratulates the
Government on its gradual approxima-
tion to the Country-party policy.” It is
very gradual. A few months ago Dr.
Page was demanding tax-reduction, and
mentioned £20,000,000 as a practicable
figure. This Budget provides only for
primage-duty reductions, reckoned at
£400,000 p.a., and a £220,000 relief from
sales tax. “No variation in rates of
income, land and estate taxes is pro-
posed,” though victims of the land tax
which was to have “burst up the big
estates” and of the 6 p.c. super tax on
property income were indulged with the
hope that their exactions would be
lightened. Perhaps it is expected that
they will be satisfied with the cuts in
service charges—3s. off the fee for wire-
less receiving sets, now 245., and Jd. off
the ltd. telephone call in the case of
residence ’phones.
Expenditure is to be increased prac-
tically all along the line. “Works and
additions” are to cost £4,298,000 com-
pared with £1,665,400 last year; fleet
construction and air services are to share
in the increase (the money is to be
drawn partly from loans), and Tasmania
is to have a telephone cable, for which
£lBO,OOO is provided. Another £270,000
is to be added to public-service pay,
naval, military and air-force employees
included. In special grants, South Aus-
tralia, Westralia and Tasmania will get
£2,400,000 altogether, an increase of
£270,000, besides which £2,000,000 is to
be distributed, as a gift without a string
to it, among all the States. Removal of
the restrictions on old-age and invalid
pensioners is expected to send the ex-
penditure to £12,000,000—£3,500,000
more than the anticipated yield from
income tax, though the rate goes up to
7s. 6d. in the £, plus 6 p.c.
The fertiliser subsidy, the grant to
growers of apples and pears and the
guarantee to exporters of oranges are to
be continued. For wheatgrowers’ relief
only £208,000 is to be voted, but this
particular item will be reconsidered
—possibly just in time for the last trump
to blow in triumph over it at the rate
the commission is progressing with its
survey. A surplus of £13,800 is antici-
pated.
Out of the surpluses for three years
—attributable chiefly to the British war-
debt moratorium —£4,160,000 is to be
paid into a Defence trust fund. And
war pensions are to be restored to the
extent of £123,000, of which £109,000
will go to the wives of incapacitated
soldiers and sailors. These are good
points of a Budget which has its weak
points. Obviously the authors were very
mindful of votes. But when the winter
of three years’ argument is past and the
time of the singing of the election birds
is come the voice of the turtle is apt
to be heard cooing everywhere except in
the Opposition camp. That is politics.

Mr. Courtenay and Mr. Spooner.
As was feared by Mr. Spooner, Mr.
Courtenay, the ex-Labor U.A.P. candi-
date for the Senate, remained in the
N.S.W. Leg. Council long enough to dish
his plan for doing away with the doss-
house vote for the City Council.
When Mr. Spooner’s Sydney Corpora-
tion (Amendment) Bill came under fire
again last week, Mr. Courtenay moved
that a lodger who pays 10s. a week for a
bare room and can show that he has
occupied it for 12 months may get his
name on the roll. Mr. Courtenay and
Mr. T. G. Murray—another great ex-
Labor U.A.P. man—led the triumphant
procession of Ayes, which included
Donald Grant, formerly of the 1.W.W.,
and Graves, secretary of the Lang group.
Asked for his opinion of the proceed-
ings of his Senate candidate, Mr. Spooner
said he had nothing to say.
♦
Mr. Stevens Is Annoyed.
Remarks made by Spencer Watts, re-
tiring president of the Sydney Chamber
of Commerce, at the annual conference
of that body disturbed the complacency
of Mr. Stevens—and Mr. Stevens is very
complacent.
Mr. Watts allows that business con-
ditions are brighter and that unemploy-
ment figures have been reduced, but,
he added, “much of the apparent and
temporary improvement is based on the
ever-growing mass of public debt.” As
to that, in spite of conversions and lower
rates on new issues, the interest bill was
higher last year than in the last boom
year. In Australia and elsewhere “there
are those who still think it possible for
a country to borrow and squander itself
back into prosperity.”
To this very plain-spoken commer-
cial man, the finances of the States are
in an “alarming” condition. Payment of
salaries and wages of permanent em-
ployees is made in money raised by
means of Treasury bills. Funds for pay-
increases granted by the State Govern-
ments (Stevens and co. are finding
another £400,000) are coming from the
same source. Mr. Spencer Watts has no
use for such rrjethods of finance. Neither
does “marketing control under Govern-
ment authority” appeal to him. He pro-
tests against “the excessive demands
made by tax-gatherers,” and foresees a
revolt of taxpayers unless the “serious
and widespread dissatisfaction with the
Taxation Acts and their administration”
is remedied.
There was more in this strain, and in
his reply Mr. Stevens was distinctly
annoyed:—
The references to the finances of the
States are extravagant and misleading. The
attack on Treasury bill finance is made
without knowledge of the true position.
The whole speech might have a damaging
effect on credit.
Quite unabashed, the critic gave the
Government still more. He said he had for
two years been a delegate to the Health
Board, and that if private enterprise
owned “the antiquated building” and
kept the premises in an equally disgrace-
ful condition it “wouldn’t get a knacker’s
license.” There was no money for hous-
ing the Health Department or for remedy-
ing “unmentionable insanitary conditions
at country schools,” but it had been
arranged to put up “a costly building for
the resurrected Rural Bank, immediately
opposite that monument of incapacity
the defunct Savings Bank.” It will cost
about quarter of a million:
Mr. Stevens says that the expenditure
will not reduce the funds available for
advances. It would appear from this that
the Rural Bank has discovered the secret
of the widow’s cruse.
Mr. Bruxner, springing to the support
of. his chief, whom he aspires to succeed,
calls the critic “a knocker.” The Bulle-
tin was called a knocker when it warned
the politicians what their loan boom
would lead to. It is not joining in their
outcry against Mr. Spencer Watts.
♦
In a Melbourne Slum.
“X.S.”: Occasionally an appalling tale
of woe is revealed of Melbourne slum
conditions, and it has nothing to do with
unemployment due to the depression.
Similar horrors have cropped up periodi-
cally since the first dynasty of slum-
dwellers set up in the metropolis.
The latest case concerned a man who
was living on the immoral earnings of
a woman with two children and an 18-
months baby. She was often drunk and
usually ferocious in her cups. The children,
when found by the police, were almost
naked, blue with cold and to all appear-
ance totally unacquainted with soap and
water. The father spent nearly all his
money on drink, but at least had a little
more regard for the welfare of the
children than the mother. When the
police raided the squalid tenement he
was feeding them —on raw meat, chopped
up and flung on a bare table.
In one way and another Melbourne
pays a heavy price for its slums. London
carries on a brisk slum-eradication cam-
paign, and Sydney has had fits of im-
provement in which many ramshackle
nurseries of degeneracy and crime were
removed from the landscape. Melbourne
has done next to nothing.

Cancer Research.
Mr. Dan Clyne, a Labor member, has
asked the Stevens Government to
appoint a royal commission to inquire
“into a statement regarding secret com-
missions on the purchase of plant and
machinery by the N.S.W. Cancer Re-
search Fund,” and also into a number
of other matters, some of which are
based on misconceptions.
The Bulletin called attention to the
unsatisfactory position of cancer re-
search in N. S. Wales two months before
it became of national interest, follow-
ing the death of Professor Chapman (self-
caused, the coroner found), but the cause
of the cancer patient can in no way be
served by a muckraking inquiry.
Cancer-research operations in N. S.
Wales have been divided. The academic
research section under the control of
Professor Chapman has been wasteful of
money (the Vice-Chancellor says the
accounts are in order) and futile in its
operations. Of the treatment side, car-
ried on at leading hospitals under the
direction of Dr. F. P. Sandes, there is no
adverse criticism. The plants installed
compare with the best in the world, and
treatment statistics show an improvement
in the “remedy” rates which justifies every
penny of the money which has been
spent. It averages about 30 p.c. of all
types, and some cancers, for which a few
years ago the only desperate remedy was
mutilation, are now treated, in many
cases effectively, without the knife.
What is needed is the formation of a
Commonwealth organisation of research
workers to concert the best brains among
the cancer therapists, physicists and
pathologists in the fight against a scourge
which kills 7000 Australians every year.
The Expensive Mandate.
If the administration of the New Guinea
Mandate is not efficient it should be.
The Mandated Territory rejoices in a
highly-paid civil service, living in its
main centres under conditions which
most Australian public servants might
envy—native servants, long leave (13
weeks in each two years) and the right
to assume an authority which would not
be tolerated on the mainland. Eight
civil servants have been made members
of the local Parliament, which their votes
control, and there is now a “Hansard”
to report their wisdom.
New Ordinances in 1933 numbered 56.
This year, according to the report to
the League of Nations, 308 whites and
about 600 native police are employed to
administer the territory, whose imports
are valued at £912,000 p.a., and whose
exports at £1,581,000. They are divided
into 11 departments, and each depart-
ment has a head. A comparison of their
financial status can well be made with
S. Australia:
Head Offices:
Chief Sec., Chief Sec.,
New Guinea. S. Australia.
Government
Secretary .. £876-972 £720
Chief Clerk .. £534-600 £434
Two clerks .. £372-462 One £292
Eight ditto .. £3OO-444 Two aver. £195
Two typists . . £156-310 Two aver. £125
The Director of Agriculture in S.A.,
controlling a department which spends
£136,000 a year and several experimental
farms, receives £lOOO p.a. His opposite
number in Rabaul, who has a staff of 16
—all with salaries over £3OO a year—•
earns from £llOO to £1250 p.a. under
his salary scale. His department spends
£11,590 per year, of which £BlO per year
goes in salaries and £1276 in travelling
expenses. Outside about £600,000 worth
of cocoanut products the whole agricul-
tural export of the Mandate could be
bought for the annual departmental
salaries.
No wonder that when the Administra-
tion wanted 10 cadets it received 2000
applications!

British Troops in China.
“Feng-Shui” : The diplomatic mind
moves with great slowness, so it is not
surprising to read that “difficulties have
arisen between the British and Japanese
military commanders in north China”
over the annual training of British troops
at the summer camp beyond the Great
Wall at Shanhaikwan.
The situation dates from the signing
of the Boxer protocol in 1901. The
Boxer rebels, with the connivance of the
Manchu Court, had laid siege to the
foreign legations at Peking. The Allied
troops assembled on the coast amidst
great bickering, and slowly advanced to
the rescue, some of the detachments
being more gradual than others, owing
to the attractions of looting and the
obligation of the German contingent to
carry out the Kaiser’s orders regarding
frightfulness. The Legation defences
were crumbling when the first British
troops arrived on the scene ; another 24
hours’ delay would probably have seen
a massacre. Naturally the Powers
decided that their nationals in Peking
would never be left open to such chances
in the future, and under the protocol
the Legation quarter became a fortified
area where the Powers could maintain
troops indefinitely.
It was a sensible precaution while the
potential enemy was armed with bows
and arrows and obsolete artillery, but
the situation changed fundamentally
years ago. Americans have been equip-
ping China with an efficient air force.
The .Chinese are now more or less a
nation, and if a fresh outburst of xeno-
phobia occurred the air force would
probably be in it. In these circumstances
the defences at Peking would only in-
vite undesirable attentions.
There is another aspect of the matter
which shows the fossil-like character of
the diplomatic body. After the National-
ists occupied Peking in 1928 they saw that
the word “capital” was a misnomer. They
saw, moreover, that in due course it
would come under Japanese influence
extending from Manchuria. They moved
to Nanking in the centre, and expected
the diplomatic body to do likewise.
Instead, it continued to repose in
majesty in the northern city. If the
diplomats had recognised that things had
changed and swallowed their dignity by
moving to Nanking, half the white
population of Peking would have gone
with them, for it mainly exists by selling
things to the legations and by conces-
sion-hunting per medium of the diplo-
matic body.
The Powers would be well advised to
leave the succor of foreigners in Peking
.to the Japanese. They are handy, and
could repeat the British exploit in
Afghanistan a few years ago, when aero-
planes from India lifted the British com-
munity from Kabul in a thousandth part
of the time it would have taken an old-
fashioned expeditionary force to do so.

Poisoning Made Easy.
The way of the poisoner is hard in most
parts of the world, but not in Australia.
Only one State has a good Poisons Act;
and how effective such a measure,
properly administered, can be is shown
by statistics. Since the Victorian
Poisons Act was passed in 1929, N. S.
Wales has had 258 suicides by poison
against 134 in Victoria. In N. S. Wales
1 death in 1525 is caused by accidental
poisoning; in Victoria, 1 in 5601.
The N.S.W. Poisons Act must be the
flimsiest piece of legislation on the
Statute Books, and the Drugs section of
the Police Offences Act which supports
it is little better. The Poisons Act has
no definitions, and it packs into 15 porous
sections a few safeguards about a few
old-fashioned murder agents. For arsenic,
prussic acid, strychnine, salvin and its oil,
the cyanides, laudanum, chloroform and
the like, the purchaser must sign a
register in which are entered his name
and address, his occupation and the pur-
pose for which he needs the stuff. If he
orders by letter, his application must be
witnessed by a J.P. or other competent
person. But he is not obliged to buy
from a registered chemist, who will ask
questions and take other precautions
prescribed. He can go to a wholesale
dealer.
From a wholesaler he can get as much
strychnine, colored or uncolored, as he
pleases. He merely has to deliver a
written unauthenticated order, and his
purchase will be supplied to him in a
packet labelled “poison.” Or he can
get certain of the deadliest poisons from
a photographer. There need be no
record.
The Act does not apply to “packets
of poisonous mixtures for the destruc-
tion of vermin, when duly marked as
such,” and many poisons of high toxicity
—the coal-tar derivatives, for instance—
are not mentioned in it. And non-N. S.
Wales residents are at liberty to order
strychnine, or cyanide from wholesalers
within it if they find that their local
regulations irk.
The patent-medicine regulations in
N.S.W. are just as ridiculous as those
dealing with more lethal substances. Any
person who has a shed in the backyard
and a few pounds to buy chemicals and
plant may set up as a manufacturing
chemist and turn out tons of rubbishy
nostrums, some of which may mean
death to persons with a perverted taste
for them. Every boarding-house has at
least one female inmate with a craze
for taking headache powders, and any
unqualified person may make them by
the ton. And almost any shop may sell
them in competition with pharmaceutists,
who are trained and registered only be-
cause somebody in the past believed that
the sale of medicines which might im-
peril life and health should be confined
to persons with the skill to know what
they are about.
The Victorian Poisons Act, with its
schedules of 130 absolute poisons and
toxic materials under control, is as near
the ideal as can be reached. It throws
the responsibility on the buyer as well
as on the seller. All the States might
well adopt it, particularly N. S. Wales.
At present, there is grim significance in
the imaginary vendor’s signature in the
specimen poison-book entry which
appears in a schedule of the ancient
N.S.W. Poisons Act. He is called
Richard Stiffener.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Combo”: She was new to the dis-
trict. We husbands, as husbands will,
thought she was charming ; our wives,
as is their way, said catty things about
her, including the innuendo that she had
a dash of the tarbrush in her veins. The

side ; her half-moons were white. “And,”
Binks continued, “if there is a trace of
dark blood she will roll her eyes to look
where a person of pure European blood
will turn the head.” The charmer was at
our place yesterday. A couple of us
husbands and three or four wives were
present. One of the cats, sitting well
over on one flank, dropped an ornament
with a loud clatter. We all held our
breaths and watched the newcomer.
She merely—oh, never mind! The wives
are now fawning on Binks as an oracle,
and what’s left of us husbands wouldn't
be seen in any bar with such a snake in
the grass.

“4 x 2”: It is all very well for “Retired
Killer” (B. 18/7/’34) to advocate sawn-
off shotguns for bank clerks, but what
about the people in the vicinity? It
will be all right, no doubt, if the marks-
man hits the thief at anything up to 20
feet, but at any longer ranges the shot
will spread in a manner calculated to
make patterns on everyone within its
radius, which increases with distance,
especially in the case of cheap Belgian
guns. If “R.K.” doubts this, let him have
a go with a 12-bore at a door, preferably
some other fellow’s door, and mark the
result.

“Box”: “Colerne’s” scepticism about
the divining-rod being hereditary (B.
18/7/’34) is not justified by the instance
he gives. John Mullins, of Colerne, Wilts.,
was my grandfather ; of his six children
by his first wife three sons and one
daughter had the dowser’s gift. Two sons
joined the old man as “water engineers,”
and, as John Mullins and Sons, of Bath,
they are still in business. Old John
appeared before the Psychical Research
Society about 60 years ago, and succeeded
in tracing water-pipes laid under a garden
and sovereigns hidden under a floor, in
spile of which the verdict was “trickery.”
Yet his method was entirely simple:
a forked twig is held, under tension, by
the end of the forks ; on passing over
running water the twig twists strongly
upwards, the vigor depending on depth
and quantity of water.

“Eugene A.”: The American police
have eliminated the bloodthirsty Dillinger
at last. Yet it wasn’t his penchant for
robbing banks or shooting sheriffs that
led to his undoing ; he was riddled with
bullets when coming out of a Chicago
cinema theatre, hardly the place where
one would have expected to find a man
with the blood of over a score of people
on his hands and a thumping price upon
his head. Dillinger, one learns, was
fond of talkies when his professional pur-
suits permitted ; on this occasion he had
been an interested spectator of a gangster
film. Apparently the flicks have a
special attraction for criminals. After
Moxley, Australia’s most wanton mur-
derer of recent years, had been captured
in French’s Forest he told the police that
he had enlivened his period of hiding on
one or two nights by riding his bike to
Mosman and patronising a picture show.

ness. Now Delysia has come into the

because charm is Delysia’s specialty.

“A.W.U.”: How’s this for a cheap
motor trip across the continent? At
Fowler’s Bay we called at the depot and
shipped five cases of petrol for
the journey across the Nullarbor
and Hampton plains to Norse-
man. With petrol at £1 a case
and beer at two shillings a
bottle, the amount spent at the
old whaling station was close
on £7. Late one day we
camped at an open dam, at
which watered a mob of steers
and three or four mobs of wild
dogs. We baited with fish
caught at Eucla, and dropped
six canines. The scalps we
passed over at the next station
homestead for £2 a nob. If it
hadn’t been for the refresh-
ments that trip would have shown a
profit, despite the cost of one puncture
patch.

“Keg”: “Bulamakau’s” par. on the
quality of Queensland beef (B. 18/7 / ’34J
brings back a memory of Amiens and an
extra-loyal Bananalander who was the
cook in our mob. His complaints about
the quality of the foreign-meat issue were
a daily affair. One day he fluked a
carcass with the Q.M.E. brand on the
gauze covering, and for hours afterwards
we listened to his recital on the virtues
of that beef. We rescued the gauze
covering, and it did duty for a week,
being substituted for every brand. The
cook’s eulogies on the beef continued till
we struck an Argentine product; after
that the covering proved of no further
use.

“R. Volt”: I see a portent in an
achievement of the Australian radio-
picture transmission service which recently
drew a proud boast from Fisk, of Amal-
gamated Wireless. It was a print of the
front page of the London “Evening
Standard,” incidentally entirely given
over to cricket. Twenty-five minutes
after being presented at the Beam office
in London it was m Melbourne. At
this rate Australian daily papers will
before long bring out their foreign news
in London and New York sections ana
have them radioed to the Australian
capitals, where stereos can go straight on
the presses. Writers of leaders on foreign
affairs will then operate at the hub,
and Australian journalists will be abroad
looking for the things that their readers
will be interested in instead of leaving
it to the judgment of foreign correspon-
dents. The next step, of course, will be
the syndicated newspaper with a world-
wide circulation and editions in every
English-speaking country. The public
is quite content • to have its intellectual
pabulum supplied by Hollywood and
Elstree, so why not its daily misinforma-
tion? The only indigenous culture then
remaining will be a few weeklies and
monthlies.

“Ming”: Speaking of accidents with
teeth and how they may be turned to
advantage (B. 25 /7 / ’34) an elderly lady
of my acquaintance was involved in a
Maoriland tram smash. When the tram
became concerned in an argument with
lorry she found her porcelain molars,
never a good fit, dislodged by the bump
and jerked to the floor. Recovering from
the shock, she was relieved to note they
were apparently intact, and stooped to
recover them. Just then she had a
brainwave, and stepped heavily on them
instead. The tram authorities footed
the bill for the new set.

“Lex”: English law has long roots.
The other day in Sydney the agent of a

lever, using, so he said in court, “no
more force than was necessary.” He
relied for his authority on the usual

employers to enter the premises where
their property was housed. An older
authority was invoked to hale him before

The school history-books, which, like

lishman’s home his castle.
BOUND FOR THE BEACHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“If the people on the beaches will not go to church,
the Church will go to the people on the beaches,
Archbishop Mowll announces. Regular services are
being arranged for Manly, Cronulla, Bondi and else-
where.”
Stern duty and pleasure in one will be rolled,
Diversions combined with devotions,
When once Mother Church has established a
hold
And driven her pegs in the stretches of gold
That fringe our assortment of oceans.
When for frolicking souls in the breakers and
shoals
With gentle persuasion she reaches,
What a lead it will give, what a lesson ’twill be
To The Lido and Newport, Dieppe and
Torquay,
When our parsons dig in on the beaches!
Can you feature the sirens, that glamorous
band
With dimity caps on their sconces,
Who float leg-to-leg or who romp hand-in-hand,
The queens of the surf with the sheiks of the
sand,
At work on these newer responses?
If you snigger or snort I feel bound to retort
That your sense it directly impeaches;
For if swimmers won’t churchward or chapel-
ward steer
When the year’s at the morn it’s abundantly
clear
That the clerics must make for the beaches.
There’s a pertinent proverb you’re certain to
know
If you’ve supped the Pierian fountain,
Which fairly sums up this particular show:
That when to Mahomet the mountain won’t go
Mahomet must go to the mountain.
And it’s also, I need hardly tell you, the creed
St. Paul so determinedly teaches;
Wherever were sinners he wended his way,
And I feel pretty sure if he’d lived in our day
Fle’d have given a turn to the beaches.
There’ll be collects to grip you, and lessons to
boot,
And soul-stirring hymns for the waking
Of grace in the graceless. No more they’ll
be mute,
The knights and the damsels the billows who
shoot
Or lie in the sunshine a-baking.
And, despite dishabille, like an elder you’ll feel
As you list to the padre who preaches;
’Twill be pleasure and duty harmoniously blent,
A prospect to view with abounding content,
When the parsons dig in on the beaches.

“Simon”: A bitter attack on State
lotteries and bridge parties and churches
which consider games of chance a
legitimate way of raising funds was
made by a Sydney pastor the other day.
“Imagine,” he said scornfully, “St. Peter
opening a ‘housie-housie’ or St. Paul
turning a chocolate wheel! ” It cer-
tainly is difficult to feature St. Paul
operating a chocolate wheel, especially
when one remembers that the Old World
wasn’t to know of the existence of choco-
late until over 1400 years later, but St.
Peter seems to have been a participant
in at least one mild flutter. It was when
a successor was needed for Judas (Acts
i, 23), “and the lot fell upon Matthias ;
and he was numbered with the eleven.”

“Selma”: A Bulletin writer tells (B.
25/7/’34) of a Brisbane songstress who
mentioned the possibility of having to
go and sing to the butcher in return for
goods. It’s not as preposterous as it
sounds, as a well-known M.L. singer can
testify. In her young days her family
was perennially hard up ; illness in the
house caused them to send her one day
to the butcher’s for enough steak to make
beef-tea. The butcher, with a huge unpaid
bill in mind, declined. “But,” he said, re-
garding the tearful damsel kindly, “I
heard you sing ‘Killarney’ at the school
concert last night, and if you’ll stand
there and sing it for me now I’ll give you
the steak for nothing.” The small girl up-
lifted a delightful soprano and sang
wholeheartedly ; the butcher, his assist-
ants and sundry customers listened and
applauded. As an encore she sang “The
Little Irish Girl,” and departed with the
steak and a pound of sausages (thrown
in for the extra item) to tell her family
of her first lucrative engagement. (
* * * *
“Rokko”: It isn’t always the milkman
who is to blame. At a Darlinghurst
residential we arranged to leave the
money inside the jug. It wasn’t long
before the sneak thief got busy ; at the
end of a week the milkman waited on
us and requested that no more money
be put out —a rival was anticipating him,
leaving milk only where the cash was
collectable. We moved to a suburban
street shortly after, and had so many
jugs and their contents stolen that finally
we chained one to the verandah post.
For a week the precaution answered ;
then a slight sound disturbed us one
morning, and we got a glimpse of a
dilapidated ancient breakfasting from the
chained jug. He ambled over to the park
opposite, and we drank milkless tea.
Nowadays we get up at 5 a.m. to make
sure of our milk.
* * * *
“Spare Taylor”: I feel a bit sniffy
about the announcement of a Mel-
bourne professor (B. 25/7/’34) that he
has rediscovered an ancient Chinese
poison made from the skin of a frog
which is untraceable by analysts. In my
time I have come in contact with men
who knew all about “secret” poisons as
administered in India, Africa, Papua and
other outlandish places. In India the
stuff was almost invariably arsenic, with
an extract of dhatura as a sideline. In
Africa the poisons have been well-known
vegetable infusions, dokkha, a plant allied
to hemp, being the usual one. Papuan
poisons seem to exist only in the imagina-
tion of people who tell them with-
out supporting their stories with facts.
It is possible that froggy really carries
a nasty kick ; anyone who has seen his
terrier frothing at the mouth after pick-
ing up a frog can realise that. It may be
that the Melbourne professor’s poison is
on the lines of the aqua tofana so popu-
lar in Italy in the days of the Borgias.
The estimable lady who devised this
began by poisoning pigs with arsenic.
She then hung the carcasses and collected
the drippings as decay went on. These
were refined and flavored pleasantly,
and probably owed their efficiency to the
setting up of a group of arsenical
ptomaines.
* * * *
“A.5.Q.”: “Second Divvy” makes a
misstatement when he writes (B.
“I’m going to apply for a
separation. The wife
hasn’t spoken for a
month.”
"Don’t he an idiot. Where’ll
you get a woman like
her?”
13/6/’34): “One of the most soldierly
beings... .six feet two of upstanding
brawn... .declared himself medically
unfit.” No member of the A.I.F.—
medical officers included —could declare
himself medically unfit; only a medical
board could do so. Again, he speaks of
a man who volunteered “for transport
services only.” All enlistments in the
A.I.F. were for general service ; the later
dispositions of the men were determined
by the various commands. Size and
vocal power are not necessarily essen-
tials to front-line ability. All army sizes
could be found on the “Horseferry Road
front,” including a V.C., and the
same can be said of the front line. I once
heard an English officer say: “Any
darned fool can go up the line, but it
takes a wise man to keep out of it.”
After years in the mud and dirt of the
trenches I was inclined to agree with him.
“Coif”: An unusual application came
before the South Australian Courts when
the executors of Josiah Symon, Senator
and K.C., asked that certain offensive
words in his will be struck out as scan-
dalous and defamatory. The Court
granted the application, and ordered
that copies of the will on file in the regis-
try should be seale,d up. Wills of the kind
are not uncommon, and in England at
least are rarely interfered with. Such dis-
positions as a quite recent one which
obtained publicity —“To my wife the sum
of one shilling to buy a book wherein to
enter all the lying scandal she has circu-
lated about me in her lifetime”—are
mildness itself compared with some of the
comments passing through the hands of
the unemotional probate officials. A
final kick at an enemy, which the latter
is unable to return in kind, is apparently
regarded as a consolation by some people
about to depart this life with a grouch.
* * * *
“Tackier”: Worsley in Lancashire is
parting with its pride and joy—a clock
which was the forerunner of the Bundy
and other elaborate contrivances
for checking working hours. It was made
to the order of the Duke of Bridgewater,
famous as a canal builder. His first canal
began at Worsley, and the Duke was on
the job himself. He was annoyed to find
“Is Mr. Smith in?”
“He’s always in to a pretty girl. What name?”
“Mrs Smith.”
that most of the workmen were invari-
ably late when setting in again at one
o’clock, after the dinner hour. Their
excuse was that they often missed the
single stroke of one from the then town
clock. The Duke’s new clock was de-
signed to strike thirteen at 1 p.m., and
after that the toilers had to think up a
new one when they were late.
* * * *
“Wandana”: The shortage of quali-
fied mining managers in Victoria recalls
a rush in which a ship’s captain figured.
Noticing that mining managers were in
demand and that these gentlemen
usually carried the Cornish prefix of
“captain,” he hung a shingle outside his
tent with “Captain B , M.M.”
painted thereon. Clients soon presented
themselves, although, as the
old skipper remarked to me,
“Any fool should know that
M.M. stands for master
mariner.” His knowledge of
mineralogy was hazy, but with
a hammer, a bag of specimens
and a notebook the necessary atmosphere
was produced; and a company was
floated on one of his “reports.” I saw
the prospectus. Reattributed the expert
opinion to “Captain B , mining
manager.”
* * * *
“X.S.”: Recent police restrictions on
the possession of firearms in Melbourne
have resulted in an unexpected windfall
for the lethal-weapon department of the
Public Library and Museum. So many
citizens have donated their armaments to
the public collection that the trustees are
positively embarrassed. Incidentally,
budding Dillingers need not imagine that
a raid on the Museum showcases will
provide them with weapons of offence.
Modern automatics or revolvers are not
exhibited.
* :K * *
“D.E.”: The chap in the newspaper
photograph had a felt hat, a soft shirt
and a spotted tie, and his outer duds
looked dowdy. He was a hatchet-faced
man, evidently in the mid-thirties; the
deep-set eyes looked shrewd; the skin
was drawn tightly over the firm jaw.
There was a hint of ruthlessness in his
expression, though mouth and nostrils
were distended in a very human grin.
“A Digger, I’ll bet a million,” I
thought, before I looked at the title,
which had been concealed by a fold of
the paper. But it wasn’t a Digger ; it
was Jardine. Yes, Jardine, aversion of
nearly all Australians who take an in-
terest in cricket, yet in appearance,
manner and methods far more akin to
Australians than fat-boy Chapman, who
was popular wherever he went in these
parts, and even Woodfull, who, seen
and heard in a talkie film, left me with
the impression (perhaps unfounded) that
he is a bit namby-pamby and self-satis-
fied. Put a tin hat on Jardine’s head
and case him in A.I.F. uniform and you
can imagine him hanging on at Villers-
Bret. or helping to storm Mont
St. Quentin. Of course, there is an
Australian branch of the family. Mem-
bers of it drove their cattle to Somerset
(N.Q.), and a cousin of the “English”
cricketer fell at Pozieres.
* * * *
“A.M.R.” (New Hebrides): The state-
ment by “Tui” in a recent issue that the
name “Pig Islander” is resented by
Maorilanders sounds queer to me.
During the war years it was an honored
title for all Enzeds serving overseas, and
I never heard of anyone taking exception
to it. I am a Pig Islander myself, and
proud of it One of the best-known regi-
ments (11th North Auckland Mounted
Rifles) sports a boar’s head in a wreath of
fern-leaves as its regimental
badge. They did a bit of
rooting with good effect on
Gallipoli and elsewhere. Dur-
ing the early part of last cen-
tury a very extensive trade in
pigs was carried on with the
Maoris, some ships lifting
hundreds at a time. Much
of the trade was done with
Australian ships, and it was
then that the name first
originated.
* * *
“Sailor”: I’ve seen some
champion newsp aper-
throwers in my time, fellows
who could put the daily rag
clean through a closed
window at 20 yards. But the
“daddies” of the profession
are the chaps that “deliver”
the papers on the Richmond
River (N.S.W.). With the
local news wrapped into a
small square parcel, and with
a favorable wind, I’ve seen
these deckhands send the
paper from the steamer in
midstream to the bank, which might be
about 60 yards distant. On a dozen or
more trips I can’t remember having seen
a misfire.
BALLADE OF A MYSTERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are countless things that we fain would
know,
a never can solve or quite find out;
And some are lofty and some are low,
But a JI obscured in a mist of doubt;
a , e .itself seems to end in “nowt,”
As Yorkshire says; yet in every clime
There’s a puzzle that puts all minds to rout:
Where go the flies in the wintertime?
History’s mysteries, row on row,
Glare like ghosts from a grim redoubt:
How did the epic of Homer grow?
Did cruel Herod expire from gout?
in the Mask a lord or lout?
Was the chopping of Charles the First a crime?
Bah! too trivial to trouble about!
Where go the flies in the wintertime?
Is heaven above? Is hell below?
Why do democrats always spout?
Who won the war some years ago?
Was Cleopatra slender or stout?
Who gave King Rufus that fatal clout?
Arc humans monkeys because they climb?
What things are these to the world-wide
shout:
“Where go the flies in the wintertime ?”
Envoy.
Prince, pray pardon a mere Boy Scout
Of History searching for Truth sublime;
I wait your ruling, with trust devout,
On where flies go in the wintertime.

POLITICAL POINTS
Lyons’s Budget betrays the practised
hand of Parkhill, who was a “campaign
director” before he turned politician.
There is something in it for nearly every
section: manufacturers, “primary pro-
ducers,” public servants, all classes of
pensioners, telephone-users, owners of
wireless-receiving sets, expectant mothers,
unemployed navvies and those who con-
sider that the Defence arms have been
starved. The only people not catered
for are those who pay Commonwealth
land tax and the 6 p.c. special tax on
property income. Their votes are not
important enough to matter.
Tattsmania got £250,062 of State
revenue from its sweeps in 1933-34 —
£87,500 in stamp duties and £162,562 in
taxes on prizes. It was nearly enough
to pay the Education bill (£251,100);
and nine-tenths of it came from the main-
landers who oppress the Tasmanians so
sorely.
Menzies has resigned from the Argyle
Ministry to stand for the Kooyong
Federal seat. Macfarlan becomes Attor-
ney-General, Solicitor-General and Chief
Secretary; Kent Hughes, Minister of
Railways and Labor ; Goudie, Minister
of Electrical Undertakings and Water
Supply, and Maltby goes into the Gov-
ernment as an honorary. Intellectually
considered, Menzies is a great loss to
the Ministry, but without him it may get
along better with the Cockies. He was
too uncompromising for them.
After the assassination of Dollfuss, “the
Nazis,” one account says, “seized motor-
lorries and advanced on Bad Aussee.”
About this time 20 years ago their fore-
runners were advancing on Belgium, and
heaps of good Aussies were enlisting to
prevent their overrunning the world.
Very possibly these good Aussies and
those who came after saved their coun-
try from horrors like those which have
been witnessed in Germany and Austria
the last month.
The success of a Douglas Credit man
in the Tas. State election has encouraged
others of the brotherhood, and tickets
are to be run at the Commonwealth
elections —in N. S. Wales and Queens-
land, at all events. It is doubtful whether
Douglas will approve, but the practice
of that prince of dodgers can’t be fol-
lowed for any length of time in Aus-
tralia. White-anting other parties has
been tried and found wanting.
The Douglasites have issued an elec-
tion manifesto which must make even
Lang envious. Public borrowing is to
cease, and the national debt will be re-
deemed in full. Taxation will be reduced
“to the point of elimination.” Work
will be “definitely found for all within
a few months.” And we are all to
enjoy “economic security”—in large
capital letters. And no doubt we should
get it if we swallowed the Douglas nos-
trum. The dead have it.
Brisbane’s Labor-controlled council
is giving it a succession of shocks as
employees suspected of being Nat.-Prog.
in sympathy are hurled out and their
places filled by “comrades.” Alderman
Austin put the position plainly at a
council meeting, replying to a protest:
“I am a firm believer in the Napoleonic
doctrine of ‘spoils to the victors.’ ” It
wasn’t a Napoleonic doctrine. Napoleon
employed Jacobins and royalists—in
short, opponents.
Kent Hughes, now a full Cabinet
Minister, blames Canberra for the re-
tirement of Latham and Lawson from
the Ministry, which was preceded by the
loss of Massy Greene and Bruce. He
says the place is accursed, inasmuch as
first-class men won’t go there, or, if they
go,- won’t stay. Certainly the present
Parliament is not a patch on pre-Can-
berra Parliaments, and the next Legis-
lature seems likely to be still worse ; but
it is not wholly ’Berra’s fault. Pledge,
selection ballot and caucus are contri-
buting to the decline.
South Aus. is to have a novel experi-
ence at the Commonwealth elections —
the spectacle of two candidates standing
in the same interest for the one seat.
The handful of people who had the
determining of the U.A.P. nomination
for Boothby could not decide between
Price, the ex-Labor sitting member, and
an aspiring lawyer named Wilson, so
both are to be endorsed. If their sup-
porters play the game, one or other will
win. Preferential voting admits of these
sporting arrangements being made.
Menzies has made such rapid strides
during his brief political career that it
seems queer to recall that the electors
had no use for him when he courted
them first. He stood for the Leg. Coun-
cil and was beaten. He entered it at his
second attempt, and remained in it four
years ; then he crossed to the Assembly
as member for Nunawading, becom-
ing Argyle’s Attorney-General imme-
diately. In one respect the young man
is unique. He is the first Victorian
politician on whom both the “Argus”
and the “Age” have lavished praise.
The Macarthur Onslow “sensation”
soon fizzled out. Lyons, replying to
Roland Green, proved to the satisfaction
“Norfolk Island already, and I haven’t got any further than the irregular
verbs!”
of members of all parties that the
Digger-Administrator of Norfolk Island
was justified in sending the young man
back to the mainland, and that subject-
ing him to a dictation test in German was
th e readiest method available. “S. M.
Herald” thereupon dropped its protege
... , , F
' t , , . .
A Mr. Aarons, secretary to the latest
band of pilgrims to Moscow, has returned
to Melbourne with the familiar report:
Russia is a magnificent country for the
worker. Like all the rest, Mr Aarons
took good care to come away from the
workers paradise, and is not going back,
Vic. Labor selection ballots for the
House of Reps, produced one surprise—
to the victim at least. Maurice Blackburn,
who was going to resign from the
Speakership of the Assembly and stand
for Bourke, was defeated by a clerk in
the Lands Department, E. W. Peters.
Long ago the able Blackburn offended a
powerful interest by coming out against
the gambling craze ; but, apart from that,
he ought to have known that the odds
were against him when a Government
employee entered the field. Labor candi-
dates are now 80 p.c. trade-union officials,
18 p.c. Government employees, 1 p.c.
farmer and 1 p.c. lawyer.
The shabby Canberra cabal which
resulted in the work of the Vic. Redis-
tribution Commissioners being scrapped
has had as shabby a sequel. W. G.
Gibson, whose seat, Corangamite, was
to have been wiped out, and who moved
that the distribution should be rejected,
is scurrying away from Corangamite to
stand for the Senate as No. 3 on the
Ministerial ticket (General Brand is No.
1, and J. W. Leckie, formerly M.H.R.
for Indi, No. 2), though fellow-Cocky
Senator Bob Elliott is coming out again.
This will give Labor a decided advan-
tage in Corangamite, as in Lang (N.S.W.),
where Dein is also executing a strategic
retreat. Gibson has always been very
thick with Pearce.
Joyful note in Lang’s newspaper:
The executive council of the Old Age
and Invalid Pensioners’ Association has
unanimously decided to rally behind the
Labor party in N.S.W. to ensure the return
of a maximum number of candidates.
The Labor “party” has promised the
pensioners the maximum amount of
lucre. Buying mass votes with public
funds is a low business, but it has never
got lower than this.
In its shiftless and expensive fashion
the Lyons Government left it to a royal
commission to say what special grants
should be given to the three small States
this year. The commission has issued its
report; and S.A. is to get £1,400,000, an
increase of £250,000; Tasmania,
£400,000, an addition of £20,000 ; and
Westralia the same amount as last year,
£600,000. Now everyone is dissatisfied,
except the commission and the Govern-
ment.
As soon as it reached office the Tas.
Labor Government announced radical
changes in the personnel of the Hobart
Public Hospital Board. There are 11
members, of whom seven are Govern-
ment nominees; appointment-day fall-
ing due, the whole seven had to make
way for members more “congenial” to
Labor —one of them is the Premier’s
wife. Dr. Gaha, the new Minister, re-
ports that “the changes were made in
pursuance of the Government’s policy,”
and seems to think that ought to silence
all objectors.
According to R. F. Fitzgerald, of
Perth, Senator Kingsmill was turned
down by the Perth Nats, at “a poorly-
attended meeting” of the party council
at which the views of candidates (Mr.
Fitzgerald was one) were not heard.
Mr. Fitzgerald is not interested in Kings-
mili, but some of the 82,898 who voted
for the veteran last time, and helped to
make him president, surely are ; but “the
poorly-attended meeting” did not con-
sult them. Mr. Fitzgerald has decided
to “throw down the gauntlet to the
junta.”
No European observer will be hood-
winked by Hitlerite disclaimers of re-
sponsibility for agitation in Austria.
Hitler, himself an Austrian, born in a
border town on the Inn, states in his
autobiography that his whole life has
been obsessed with the idea of Austro-
German union, and that as a child he
and his companions preferred to sing
“Deutschland fiber Alles” to the Aus-
trian “Kaiserlied.” His “young heart
seethed with love of the Pan-Austro-Ger-
man Empire and hatred of the Austrian
State.”
Randolph Bedford’s long-distance
defamation suit against Brisbane “Tele-
graph” is not over yet. At the second
hearing, the jury found for the plaintiff ;
damages, a shilling. While argument as
to the costs of both trials was raging it
was given out that there would be
another appeal.
E. J. Hughes continues to be a night-
mare to Westralian Labor. First, he satis-
fied one Court that Clydesdale, M.L.C.,
was, as chairman of the Lotteries Com-
mission, holding an office of profit under
the Crown ; then he convinced another
that a Government measure designed to
save Clydesdale’s seat and a £2OO fine
awarded to Hughes was inoperative.
Next he got an opponent heavily fined
for a breach of the Electoral Act, com-
mitted during a Leg. Council election.
Now he has recovered £lOO damages from
another Labor M.L.C. (Gray), the secre-
tary of the Fremantle Trades Hall and
a third “comrade” for distributing anti-
Hughes pamphlets during the same cam-
paign. The worst of it is that he re-
mains a “comrade,” being a financial
member of a trade-union.
Food and grocery prices, which rose
from June to April in all capitals, are
now on the decline. Queensland, the
State with the high-
est average male
wage, shows the
cheapest cost index
—723 against N. S.
Wales’s 811 and Vic-
toria’s 742. All
Eastern States have
a weighted average
17.6 p.c. to 24.4 p.c.
above 1914 index
levels. At the same
time, remoter indi-
vidual States and
towns have made a
relative improve-
ment by comparison
with eastern centres.
W.A. costs, for in-
stance, are only 5.3
p.c. above those
ruling before the war, and Geraldton
enjoys the minimum advance over 20
years ago —3.5 p.c.
From Dongara or thereabouts:
The Collier Government in Westralia, upon
which has fallen the uncongenial task of making
some show of “implementing” a referendum
decision which it doesn’t believe to be either
desirable or practicable, has one member who
fought Federation to the last ditch. This is
J. M. Drew, M.L.C. and State Secretary. Drew
wasn’t a Laborite in 1900, and it wasn’t till
years after he had sat in the first Labor Cabinet
as an ally that he swallowed the pledge. When
the Federation controversy was at its hottest he
was one of four newspaper editors who un-
loaded their views before a commission
appointed by Forrest. His opinion was uncom-
promisingly hostile to the idea of Westralia
joining up with the other colonies; he foresaw
nothing but disadvantages and perils in it, and
he stressed his gloomy forebodings in his own
paper, the Geraldton “Express,” even at the
risk of alienating his goldfields constituents.
Drew would therefore be the obvious man
to take the secession petition to England with
entire consistency and a “I-told-you-so” atti-
tude but for one thing. He is nowadays, on
his own admission, “not a secessionist.”

Major William Merriman Trew,
D. 5.0., who passed over at Caulfield
Military Hospital last week at 51,
struggled for 12 years against the wounds
he got at Bullecourt. He refused to be
a cot-case, and, though a couple of yards
on his crutches was all he could manage,
he used to go shopping in an invalid-
chair. He was in the 24th Battalion.
“Wealsman”: Touching the racial
origins of the Speck’s new Government,
it is unfair to say (B. 4/7/’34) there is
“not an Englander among them.” Major
Davies, who, in addition to his D.S.O,
and M.C., got a lot of Russian experience
and a St. Vladimir Order out of the war,
is descended from natives of Manchester
on both sides. His father (formerly a
Tas. mine manager) was Australian-born ;
his mother was English.
“Nig.”; Few suspected “Dryblower’
Murphy, the Westralian bard, of political
aspirations, but his name was unexpect-
edly found on the list anxious for en-
dorsement by the Nat. Council as candi-
dates for the Senate. A campaign con-
ducted by the mercurial rhymester would
have had its picturesque side; but an
unimaginative majority declared him
“unfinancial,” and therefore ineligible.
He says he is coming out in spite of it.
Man of Peace:
F. R. Jordan, C.J.
The N. S. Wales
Chief Justice had
to send the lachry-
mose Mrs. Edols
back to gaol on
Thursday, and his
friends say he
hated it. Music,
foreign languages,
the classics and the
affairs of Sydney
Uni. (where he was
a Challis lecturer)
are his gentle in-
terests, outside his
nrofession. A great
Equity lawyer, he
auas to an exten-
sive knowledge of
mankind and the
worm a most im-
pressive presence.
R. E. Priestley,
M.C., M.A., Agr.
Dip. (Cantab.), is
Melbourne Univer-
sity’s first salaried
Vice - Chancellor.
The job is worth
£2OOO p.a. and has
been rendered
necessary by the
growth of an in-
stitution that har-
bors upwards of
3000 students.
Priestley has been
soldier, Antarctic
explorer and geo-
logist, and he collaborated with Pro-
fessor David in “Antarctic Geology.”
He won his M.C. in France with a signal
company, and wrote the volume in the
“Official History of the War” which deals
with the signal service. He earned his
new job by his work as administrator of
Cambridge University, coupled with a
tribute by Lord Rutherford to his organ-
ising abilities. He was born in Bristol
48 years ago.
“Jeames”: Fran?ois Coty, the world’s
richest scent-maker, who has died in
Paris, served as the model for innumer-
able capitalists in French and Austrian

comedies. He had the requisite volatility,
admiration for the ladies and readiness
to lavish cash on anything likely to get
him limelight. He started half a cen-
tury ago as an uneducated Corsican
hawker, and he was a multi-millionaire
in francs before middle age. Ten years
ago he was probably the richest man
in Europe; but his wife got over
£3,000,000 by way of a divorce settle-
ment, and he had to sell half his busi-
ness in 1928 to keep his newspapers
(“Figaro,” “Gaulois” and “L’Ami du
Peuple”) going. He was a Corsican Sena-
tor, and, like nine self-made Frenchmen
out of ten, believed he was a reincar-
nated Napoleon.
B. J. Hennessy, who died in Sydney
on Thursday, belonged to a firm of archi-
tects which celebrated its jubilee a few
weeks ago. He arrived from Ireland in
1884, when old “J.F.” (who had just been
retained by the City Council to design
the Centennial Hall) founded Hennessy,
Hennessy and Co. Since then the firm,
which in young “J.F.” possesses a repre-
sentative of the third generation, has had
practically every big R.C. job on offer,
including the completion of St. Mary’s
Basilica, St. Patrick’s College, Manly,
St. Joseph’s College, Hunter’s Hill, and
scores of homes and convents in N. S.
Wales and other States. In addition, the
Hennessys have designed and supervised
the erection of big buildings in S. Africa
and M.L.
A distinguished son of Yackandandah
(Vic.), Sir Kenneth Beatty to wit, is re-
visiting his homeland. After passing
through Melbourne University, he was
called to the Bar in London. He be-
came public prosecutor of the Transvaal
after the S. African War. Later he was
Chief Justice of Bermuda and the
Bahamas, and now he is C.J. of the Rock
of Gibraltar.
“Cosmos”: Englebert Dollfuss, who has
died a martyr to the cause of Austrian
freedom —his main policy was to keep
his country and Middle Europe out of
the Nazi Reich —started his political life
with almost every handicap. He had
a peasant’s accent, which the officer and
official classes in Vienna despise ; he was
less than sft. high; he had risen from
the ranks in the army; and he was a
fervent clerical, which alienated Vienna’s
strong party of anti-clerical Socialists.
Yet he became Chancellor two years ago
by popular choice after demonstrating
his administrative gifts as Minister for
Agriculture. Courage and idealism were
his chief assets. Unlike Hitler and Mus-
solini, he was a poor platform-speaker.
Man of War: L. J. Courtenay, M.L.C.
Though selected by the U.A.P. Doges as
one of their candidates for the Senate,
this pugnacious little Sydney business-
man is ever ready to treat the Bligh-street
machine as if it didn’t exist. Local
government is his speciality, and he
was chiefly respon-
sible for the Gov-
ernment reverses in
the Leg. Council
on the lodger vote
and .the contracts
ordinance. When
not looking for
fight in the Upper
House, he likes to
find someone, such
as Jock Garden or
Donald Grant, to
take him on in the
City Council,
where he has re-
presented Phillip as
a Reformer for
years. In business
circles and in
Longueville, where
he lives, he is re-
garded as a model
of amiability and
good nature.
“Bill” Barton, of Manfred Downs
(n.-w. Q.), who has been killed in a
motor smash, joined the A.I.F. in ’l5,
served with the 11th L.H. till the Turks
called it a day, and had the distinction
of being the youngest man to get a com-
mission in the Desert Column. He was
under 20 when the war ended.
Sydney Eastern Suburbs Synagogue,
whose elders recently had a difference of
opinion with the small but eloquent
Rabbi Kirsner, has secured a new
minister with full rabbinical honors.
Men of his attainments are rare in con-
gregations. Rabbi Dr. Marcus Wald is
a Hungarian who went to London owing
to anti-Semitism in his own country. He
is a doctor of philosophy and a brilliant
Talmud scholar.
“C.Q.”: A couple of genuine heroes
figured at the recent annual distribution
of medals by the Royal Humane Society
in Melbourne. Marcus Stapleton, a Ben-
digonian, saved two companions in a mine
disaster while the fuses of 17 explosive
charges were fizzing round him. He got
the Clarke gold medal, which was last
awarded seven years ago. Leonard Fair-
hall jumped into a dam at Ringwood and
rescued another lad from drowning. Fair-
hall is seven years of age, and looked
about two kerosene-tins tall when he
stood up to receive his bauble.
B. J. McGrath and T. McNevin, coun-
sel and solicitor respectively for the
Casey family before the Royal Com-
mission, which has moved from Mel-
bourne to Sydney, both saw sea service
in the R.A.N. McGrath, who retired
with the rank of lieut.-cornmander to
start practice at the N. S. Wales Bar, was
an instructor-commander for 11 years.
He is one of the editors of “The Laws of
the Commonwealth.” McNevin was a
senior midshipman serving in the Atlantic
when he decided to take advantage of a
retrenchment scheme under which offi-
cers were compensated for resigning.

“Carolina”
Starring Janet Gay nor at the Regent.
This lady is perhaps the most perfect
example of a one-part actress in the
movie business. She is for ever Cin-
derella. Here she represents a humble
little Yankee in love with the son of a
proud but indigent Southern couple
(Robert Young is the son ; Lionel Barry-
more the father) who despise her till she
shows them how to make a fortune by
growing tobacco.
You know beforehand that she will
have a washing-up scene, a Little Mother
scene, scenes in which she wears an
old hat and boots and registers girlish
indignation, wistfulness and grief, and
a scene in which she comes shyly into
Love’s Kingdom wearing the best that
money can buy. Her business never
varies (the self-consciously modest ex-
ploitation of the legs and arms; the
tiny steps ; the startled glance, as of a
wild thing in the presence of a hunter ;
the trustful, wide-eyed smile when Mr.
Right proves his bona fides), and she
uses practically no make-up. The ex-
planation of her vogue seems to be
that, in spite of the popularity of gang-
sters and Mae West, there is a public for
Early Victorianism.
“Baby, Take a Bow!”
James Dunn, having done his sen-
tence, marries Claire Trevor, gets a job
as chauffeur, and is blessed with an
infant phenomenon (Shirley Temple).
He gets a friend who has just come out
of the same gaol a job, and they and
their girls are living in idyllic happiness
when a pearl necklace is missed. Alan
Dinehart, an inspector, tries to convict
them of the theft, but only succeeds in
making a low-comedy ass of himself. The
real thief gives the infant above-men-
tioned the pearls when in a tight corner ;
then Dinehart barges in truculently, with
his hat on and a cigar in the side of his
mouth, as usual, and starts looking for
them. The climax consists in the capture
of the pearl-thief by the ex-convicts and
the utter humiliation of the inspector.
Shirley Temple, who looks about four,
gives a marvellous performance in what
is really the chief part, and Dinehart’s
degrading portrait of an upholder of
law and order is funnier than anything
he has done yet. The others repeat the
formulae they have employed.
“Lone Cowboy”
Jackie Cooper’s fawther, an ex-cow-
puncher, couldn’t stand the cows after
his wife died, so he went to Chi. and
stole for the boy’s dear sake. When
threatened with arrest he sent Jackie
out West to an old pal and committed
suicide. The heart of the old pal—a
morose individual engaged in a hunt
for his wife and the man she ran away
with—is softened by Jackie’s prattle, and
when he does shoot the ravisher of
his honor it is in self-defence. Unfor-
tunately, Jackie gets in the line of fire
and is wounded nigh to death. Then he
recovers, and he and the cowboy go off
into the great wide spaces cuddling
each other affectionately and warbling
ditties about dogies.
The stars in the ceiling of Sydney
Capitol looked coldly down on this opus,
and present critic felt cold, too, in face
of so much sloppy sentiment and un-
natural behavior.
“Call It Luck”
Herbert Mundin is a London cab-
driver who wins £25,000 in a lottery and
with his beauteous niece (Pat Paterson)
sails for New York. Before he sails a
Yankee crook sells him an old cavalry
horse represented to be Sabre —another
Phar Lap. Crooks of the same gang
meet Mundin at the wharf and relieve
him of the rest of his money. So he
takes to cab-driving, with Sabre between
the shafts. He # enters the nag for a big
race and gets a widow to back it with
the crooks to win 25,000 dollars. The
kindly owner of the real Sabre now sends
his steed to the racecourse, Mundin and
the synthetic flier being locked up by the
beauteous Miss Paterson and her young
man (Charles Starrett). But the crooks
kidnap the authentic champion, and
Mundin, escaping, gets his horse to the
track before the barrier rises. By
tootling the cavalry charge on a bugle
he brings the retired war-horse in a
winner, and the crooks pay up. We
repeat, the crooks pay up! Most of the
principals would have been warned off
over the affair in Australia, but they
seem to run racing on different lines in
America.
“The Wandering Jew”
Conrad Veidt’s acting in this version
of the ancient legend has been applauded
already by The Bulletin’s Melbourne
critic.
The leading ladies did most to kill
illusion, so far as the writer was
concerned—more particularly in the
mediaeval sequences. They eat vora-
ciously, holding chunks of meat in their
hands, as in Laughton’s Henry Vlll.
film ; but, as in the Laughton film, their
hands are manicured, their faces mas-
saged and their eyebrows plucked.
At Sydney State: (1) Adolphe Menjou; (2) Katharine Hepburn;
(3) C. Aubrey Smith.
Some day a director will be consist-
ently realistic, and exhibit the inhabitants
of one of those periods when razors and
soap were unknown, and no one had a
bath except by accident, as the unkempt
and verminous beings they were. In
point of fact the best people in Eng-
land put in much of their time scratch-
ing themselves throughout the eighteenth
century ; and an all-over wash once a year
was considered a fair thing for a fashion-
able charmer such as Lady Melbourne
in the early part of Queen Victoria’s
reign.
But “The Wandering Jew” is worth see-
ing if only for Veidt’s imaginative study
at the beginning of a man’s slow realisa-
tion that a loved one. is not asleep but
dead; and he also touches something
like greatness in the Inquisition
sequence.
“Tembi”
A jungle film, also at the Mayfair. This
is a fascinating production, not because
of the animals and birds, which are get-
ting as boringly familiar on the screen
as exotics, but because of the occa-
sional shots of a nigger papa, mamma
and baby. The father is a splendid
physical specimen, and the little boy,
who follows him about like a dog, is
a marvel of pluck and cleverness.
“The Fire Raisers”
An unspeakably foolish melodrama.
Leslie Banks is a lawyer who helps a
gang of crooks to burn half London
down for the insurance money. Then
they sink a ship with all hands, and
Banks repents. In the next fire he
double-crosses his confederates, sends for
the police, and ascends to his heavenly
reward by way of the flames.
“Jack Ahoy!”
A British film which is appearing
simultaneously at Melbourne Majestic
and Sydney Lyceum. Jack Hulbert
fails in his exams, for officer, and turns
up on H.M.S. Stupendous as an A.B.
Here he falls in love with the daughter
(Nancy O’Neill) of Alfred Drayton, an
admiral who must have risen in the ser-
vice on the grounds of his democratic
amiability. The fleet proceeds to China,
where pirates who have captured a
British submarine carry off the admiral
and his daughter from a ball. Hulbert
and his seaman colleague, Sam Wilkin-
son, enter the pirates’ haunt, threaten
the gang with a machine-gun, get the
party aboard the stolen submersible and
proceed to sea, followed by the ban r
dits in a motor-launch equipped with
a quick-firer. After submerging and
emerging several times the submarine, a
comedian of first-class quality, is spotted
by the fleet, which opens a bombard-
ment on it. Fortunately, the shooting is
disgracefully bad. The show ends with
the rescue of the fugitives and the dis-
covery that Hulbert is the grandson of
the admiral’s favorite commander in by-
gone days.
The Admiralty equipment is used with
extraordinary ability. In fact, the film
would be outstanding on its naval
pageantry alone. Also, the situations are
as artlessly funny as anything present
critic has seen, and the dignity of the
Silent Service is nowhere compromised.
“Australia”
E. Gordon Donkin, who made this
film and showed it on Sunday night at
the Prince Edward, is a wealthy pas-
toralist with a patriotic desire to adver-
tise his native land. Obviously the only
effective way to do it is to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth, and he has
done so with astonishing skill for an
amateur. There is nothing arty about the
photography; it is straight representa-
tional stuff which depicts every aspect of
life in the parts of the Commonwealth
that Mr. Donkin knows best —the North,
Central Australia and the Eastern States.
The accompanying remarks are interest-
ing, and there is some comedy. The
film is to be shown abroad, where it
should do good, if only by dispelling illu-
sions about the bush which movies such
as “The .Squatter’s Daughter” have
created.
The new His Majesty’s in Melbourne
was opened on Saturday by Col. White
and “White Horse Inn” before an enor-
mous crowd, through which sundry of
the Tait brothers wandered with the
usual disconsolate expression on their
faces, having omitted to provide them-
selves with seats. The scene was one of
unparalleled magnificence. A giant com-
missionaire in a surprising uniform and
sundry attendants equally splendidly
garbed ushered paying and non-paying
guests over the red carpet into foyers
replete with every modern novelty. The
entertainment provided was a scene-
shifter’s nightmare in three acts and 493
scenes. The choruses, half a dozen regi-
ments of them, changed their clothes
3769 times, and each fresh change would
have provided a more marvellous spec-
tacle than the last if the first had not
exhausted all the possibilities latent in
the marvellous. The amount of livestock
on the stage, which included goats, kids
and cows, suggested that one of these
days the actor will be no more ; his
place will be taken by shepherds, bird-
fanciers, animal-trainers, lion-tamers,
camel-drivers and jackeroos, while the
producers will be replaced by vets. The
number of mechanical appliances, which
included a steamer, a revolving stage and
a panorama backcloth on which color-
mixers threw sunrises, sunsets, storms and
other natural effects while you wait, sug-
gested that engineers and electricians will
be more important than the musicians,
the writers of the lyrics and the com-
posers of the books. In short, the revival
of the flesh-and-blood stage is a mis-
nomer when applied to “White Horse
Inn” ; it ought to be the revival of the
ancient Roman games, by entrepreneurs
with such resources of science at their
command as would have embarrassed the
Emperor Nero, who could only draw on
the resources of the Roman world.
Col. White, whose department has
some connection with literature since one
of its activities is suppressing it, referred
to Shakspeare in his opening address no
fewer than three times, which was
thoughtful of him, for it is probably the
last time Shakspeare is ever likely to be

utility in its own area, and therefore a
more or less assured return on its capital,
the fully-paid £5 shares are one of the
most popular stocks on the market; and
they seem likely to remain so while
money is cheap and until prospects for
traders generally greatly improve. At
£l4 13s. (the price was never better) the
scrip returns the investor 4.4 p.c. on a 13
p.c. div. basis. The 13 p.c. is, of course,
mostly nominal; actually it is worth no
more than 6.1 p.c. at the average auction
price (£lO 10s. 3d.) of all shares sold by
the co. during the last 56 years.
The long-talked-of Victorian Gas
legislation came into operation at the
beginning of March last. One of its
chief provisions was substitution of a
calorific standard of 500 B.T.U. for the
illuminating-power standard prescribed
by the Act of 1878 (no attempt was made
to regulate divs., etc.). In anticipation
of lower costs, 3d. per 1000 c.f. was
knocked off the price to consumers from
Jan. 12, thus reducing the figure from
7s. 6d. to an average of ss. over
the last four years. This and lighter
sales of gas and residuals, as is usual
during the June half, resulted in a slip
of £57,461 (= 4}d. per 1000 c.f.) in
gross earnings:

The saving in outgoings was per
1000 c.f., due mainly to new coal-
handling equipment, more efficient gas-
making plant and a lighter charge on
account of alterations to head office—
£sooo as against £15,000 for the pre-
vious half. In 1932 a new 50-year lease
was taken, and the old building, put up
40 years earlier, is being remodelled.
After allowing for an unexplained re-
duction of £5744 in the meter-renewal
reserve (£6207), the year’s net result was
only £4O lighter at £203,937. The div.
took £169,000, and £27,178 (up £7989)
was spent on extensions and improve-
ments to plant and charged to earnings,
leaving £7759 for reserves.
In front of the £1,300,000 of share
capital there is £1,863,100 (down
£134,200 over the twelvemonth) of de-
benture money, costing the co. from 4
p.c. to 8 p.c., and maturing at various
dates up to 1943. The co. continues to
pay the full contract rate, notwithstand-
ing that the Vic. Financial Emergency
Act gives it power to make a cut of
221 P-c., provided the rate is not re-
duced below 5 p.c.

This 14-year-old puts more of Queens-
land’s wool under the hammer than any
other broker in the State, thanks partly
to a flying start (it took over John
Bridge’s northern business) and partly to
the fact that the div. is limited to 7 p.c.
until at least 20 p.c. of the commission
charges are rebated to consignors, which,
of course, puts a different complexion on
things for shareholding clients. The
rebate on wool commissions rose to 40
p.c., fat stock to 30 p.c. and produce to
20 p.c. Owing to contraction of turn-
over and uncertain outlook, no rebates
were made in ’32, but they were renewed
in the following term, and repeated again
for the last one, at the rate of 25 p.c. for
wool and fat stock and 20 p.c. for pro-
duce and property ; the amount involved
is not mentioned.
It was the rise in the price of wool
(the Australian average was £8 15s. 6d.
better at £2O 4s. lid. a bale) that put
the spring into last year’s earnings. Owing
to the lighter clip, the co. received 1299
fewer bales (112,246); but it sold 35,528
less, due to postponement of the June
sales, following the German embargo:

1934.. 82,556 2,841,731 + 1,040,005
Still, turnover was over a million pounds
better, and, after allowance for the re-
bates already referred to, declared net
earnings improved £4700, reaching a
shade over 9 p.c. on average capital as
against 7.3, 8.8, 8.7 and 8.6 p.c. back to
1930. The div. was kept at 6 p.c., and
it is doubtful whether anything better
need be looked for for a while.
A new branch was opened at St.
George in March, and another at Cunna-
mulla since the close of accounts. Also,
the co. bought itself a new headquarters
freehold, with some letting space, at the
corner of Adelaide and Creek streets,
Brisbane. The price is not mentioned,
but £31,447 net was added to the book
value of freehold and leasehold:

To meet the outlay, carry an extra
£49,541 of advances and reduce the
amount coming to sundry creditors
(£274,808) by £149,304 —the drop was
due to advance payments by wool buyers
at the previous balance—the co. went to
its bankers for £90,651 and drew upon
cash for £124,619. The contraction in the
more or less liquid surplus (£96,598) was
£16,426.
The outlook is for a good season, but
the German embargo and Italy’s decision
to reduce imports of Australian wool by
half from August 1 make prices very
uncertain.

Considering the semi-luxury nature of
the business (ice-cream is the principal
line), this co. has put up an extraordi-
narily good performance, thanks to the
efficiency of the management and the
plant, the co.’s tight grip upon the
market in N. S. Wales, the quality of
its product and the comfortable nature
of its finances. Over the last 11 years
divs. averaged 11.2 p.e., the lowest being
7.8 p.e. in ’33, and more was put by
than was distributed. Including an un-
specified amount for depreciation, re-
serves are now £125,821 in excess of
paid capital, of which £78,915 (Is. per
share) was returned in ’32.
Last year there was a marked in-
crease in turnover, and the associated cos.
in Queensland, Vic. and W.A. paid 31
p.e., 6 p.e. and 5 p.e. respectively in
their last terms—-of the parent’s funds
£82,200 is represented by scrip in these
inter-State offshoots, and £70,000 of the
reserves came from the sale of trade-
marks and goodwill. Declared net earn-
ings sprang £11,117, reaching 10.9 p.e.
on average capital as against 7.8, 5.2,
10.2 and 9.8 p.e. back to 1930. That
was after £34,779 (£15,345 more than in
the previous term), or 7.4 p.e. of the
book value of plant, etc., dropped from
somewhere into the general, taxation and
depreciation reserves; so the co. may
have done a bit better than was claimed.
The market, which sees no cloud in
the co.’s sky, prices the fully-paid 14s.
shares at 31s. 6d. as against 245. a year
ago. At the higher figure the return is
4.7 p.e. on a 10.7 p.e. div. basis. Includ-
ing the provision for depreciation, the
cover is £2 6s. 4d. per pound of paid
capital.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it:

Most of the year’s allowance for depre-
ciation, etc., appears to have been put
into the bank. Including stocks but
not investments, the more or less liquid
surplus (£106,087) improved £37,164 over
the twelvemonth.

This old-established Maoriland concern
is in the pastoral-finance, wool-broking
and farm-produce, etc., business. Its last
declared net earnings are the best since
1926, thanks to the sharp rise in wool
and mutton prices; dairy produce
brought its owners less:

Another factor which helped was the
reduction in overhead—for the three
years to the close of accounts' in 1933,
the cut in working exes, was 39 p.c., the
board says ; there has been a statutory
cut of 20 p.c. in fixed-interest charges,
though the co. may have lost more than
it gained in this respect. Also, provided
it proves to be adequate, the £98,224
struck off for bad and doubtful debts in
the previous term has relieved earnings
of a heavy handicap.
The £41,354 of profit claimed was
enough to pay a full year’s pref. div.
(£13,741) and show 9.1 p.c. on ord. capi-
tal. But payments to the prefs. had
fallen six months behind, and reserves
had been reduced tt) a shadow, owing to
the writing off already referred to. So
the prefs.’ slate was cleaned, 3 p.c. was
handed to the ords. (they went without
in ’33 for the first time in 38 years) and
£13,609 was added to the lay-by, making
it visibly £41,742.
The outstanding feature of balance-
sheet figures is the extent to which the
co. has borrowed to lend:

£2 16s. Id. of outside money (debentures,
£1 2s. 6d. ; other liabilities, £1 13s. 7d.)
at risk in the business for every pound
belonging to shareholders, and advances,
the most vulnerable point of the busi-
ness, amounted to 69.1 p.c. of the
balance-sheet total. To clip £22,720 off
the debenture debt, add £9451 to shares
in other cos. (they include a half interest
in the Challenge Phosphate Co.), carry
an extra £37,590 of stocks and £25,859-
of debtors’ balances, and strengthen the
cash holding by £74,883, the book value
of fixed assets was reduced by £21,089,
and £114,306 was added to the floating
debt, which includes the staff pension
fund, shown separately for the first time
at £109,600. Excluding shares in other
cos., the improvement in the more or
less liquid surplus (£124,937) was £46,746.
A drop in the exchange rate might
affect debtors’ balances. The market notes
this, the debt, and the uncertain outlook
in overseas markets, and prices the 54-
p.c. prefs. (reduced to 5 p.c. by the
statutory cut) at par as against 11s. a
year ago. The ords. at 18s. 3d. (Bs. 6d.
a year ago) yield 3.3 p.c. on a 3 p.c.
div. basis. The book value of the cover
is £2 7s. 4d. prefs., and 225. 9d. ords.

In the Ludowici Short Centre Pivot Drive, a calculated percentage of the
weight of the motor is used, by means of the patented Pivot Base, to maintain
a constant belt tension under all conditions. The result is continuous power
transmission without belt slip, and without the complication and added
expense of a Jockey Pulley.
Further, the Pivot Drive can be installed with shorter pulley centres than any
other type of belt drive, and it enables machines such as Hydraulic Pumps,
Clay Mixers, etc., to be started up against full load, without belt slippage.
Our Engineer will be pleased to show you the Pivot Drive in operation, and
to demonstrate how it will improve plant efficiency.

(always hungry items in this class
of business) the declared net result
was £5235 better at 8.9 p.c. on capital
as against 6.4, 4.9, 3.7, 11.4, 11.4, 11.3
and 12.3 p.c. back to 1927. The div.
was lifted 2\ points, making 1\ p.c. for
the year, the final being at the rate of
10 p.c. p.a.
It is by no means certain, however,
that the rate for the last half will be
maintained during the current term. The
brightest features in the outlook are the
continued growth of employment, rise
in the price of wheat and more satisfac-
tory position of the dairy-farmer. The
market, more concerned about wool than
election prospects, doesn’t expect any-
thing better than 1\ p.c. On this basis
the pound shares return 4.6 p.c. at 335. ;
the price was 255. a year ago. The cover
is 265. 9d. in net tangibles.
For 20 years to the end of 1929 share-
holders got a steady 10 p.c., sweetened
with £75,000 of bonus scrip and special
cash distributions totalling £67,500. To
provide accommodation for an extra 170
guests, making total capacity 500, a new
wing was erected about half a dozen
years ago, and the old building was
modernised. Shareholders put up an
extra £60,000 of capital, which brought
with it £15,573 of share premiums, and
the board didn't go outside for much:
1927. 1931. 3 933. 1931.
Paid capital.. £150,000 £210,007 £210,007 £210,007

Stock.. .. 2,247 3,770 2,884 2,524
Book debts, cash,
etc 35,663 1,927 5,151 13,127
The debt, down £2590 last year, is being
gradually reduced. When the books
closed it exceeded more or less liquids
by £lB5l, the improvement being £10,206
over the twelvemonth. Fixed assets are
reported in first-class order; much
depends upon that.
Another Anglo-Australian holding co.,
with a powerful backing, is to be hatched
in London presently. It is expected that
the public will be offered 1,800,000
shares of 10s. each, which have been
underwritten by the vendors free of cost
to the co. The idea is to consolidate the
gold-mining interests of several concerns,
including Zinc Corp. and Imperial
Smelting Corp. According to cable
reports, the new co. will hold a con-
trolling interest in Western Mining
Corp., Gold Mines of 1 Australia and
Bendigo Mines.

Golden Dyke, a Sydney co., which
took over a reefing proposition at
Shackle Creek, Northern Territory, ex-
pects its 50-ton-a-day plant to be ready
for the feed by the middle of August.
On the 100 ft. level the lode, where
driven upon, is 17ft. wide and assays
lOdwt. Approximately 100,000 tons of
payable stone has been exposed. V. L.
Newberry, who traced the formation for
2600 ft. on the surface, put probable ore
above the 100 ft. level at 250,000 tons,
averaging between 9dwt. and 13dwt. With
gold at £7 10s. an ounce (Australian cur-
rency) a profit of £2125 a month was
spoken of. It is intended to explore the
deeper zones by diamond-drilling, and
to prove the extension of the ore-body
by further shaft sinking and driving.

Reid’s Flat mine, midway between
Crookwell and Cowra (N.S.W.), has been
looked over by an expert, who says it
contains very rich deposits of wolfram
4find scheelite. During the war wolfram
was commandeered by the Imperial Gov-
ernment ; but the price fell so sharply
after cessation of hostilities that this and
other shows closed down. Reed’s Flat
produced about £lO,OOO worth of con-
centrates. On one side of the hill veins
of tin have been located. The mine has
been proved over an area of 33 chains
by 4 chains, and with wolfram at 495.
per unit it may soon be working again.
Golden Plateau, the pick of the
Cracow (Q.) shows, paid its first div. (2s.
per share) in April last. A further 3s.
per share will be sent out August 22.
Crushings for each of the last three
months compare as follows:
f— —-—-Four Weeks Ended \
May 20. June 23. July 21.
Tons crushed .. 1640 1020 1757
Yield, ounce . . 2450 2412 2480
Average, dwt. .. 29.8 29.7 28.2
The grade of the stone is thus fairly

At White Hill, Miclere, about 21 miles
from Clermont (C.Q.), alluvial gold has
been won at two horizons, the first, or
false bottom, at depths up to 39ft. ; and
the second and much older bedrock at
from 70ft. to 90ft. deeper. The gold is
mostly in a fine state of division, though
nuggets up to lOdwt. were found about
half a mile upstream. Owing to low
average returns, uneven bottom and the
patchy nature of the ground the area is
unsuitable for large-scale operations,
though fossickers may continue to do
well.
* * * *
Drillers, Ltd., an offshoot of Oil
Search, is stabbing a closed structure at
Warooby Creek, near Roma (Q.). Last
week the hole was down 3714 ft., and the
formation continued mostly hard and
compact. Bedrock is about 3900 ft., in
the vicinity of which the best oil-laden
gases have been obtained in the past.

South Blue, on the Sheepshead line,
which is the richest of the Bendigo lode
channels, has installed powerful wind-
ing and air-compressing machinery, on
the True Blue shaft, which is 1640 ft.
deep. The magnet is the untried reefs.
Stone will first be broken from the 510 ft.
and 570 ft. levels. The property adjoins
the New Blue, which recently crushed
500 tons, averaging 4dwt., and at 1800 ft.
the lode has an “improved appearance.”
* * * *
In its new shaft, east of Toohey’s, at
Bolwarrah (Vic.), Gordon Gold Develop-
ment has struck the cap of a fresh reef
at 94ft. Here two tons of stone yielded
540 z. lldwt. of retorted gold, with an
estimated 30dwt. per ton in the tailings.
Since the reef in Toohey’s dips slightly
to the east, it may junction with the
present find lower down.

A Burmese crowd is nibbling at the
Briseis, Central Briseis and Arba tin-
mines, Derby (Tas.). A Launceston syn-
dicate purchased the Briseis leases and
the remains of the plant after the disas-
trous flood in 1929, and tributors have
since turned out a fair quantity of tin.
The Tasmanian Government is consider-
ing the extension of hydro-electric power
to the mine.

Sutherland and Packett are opening up
a promising bismuth and wolfram show
at Moina, on the Mount Claude field
(Tas.). The country is composed of
micaceous-granite rock, and the lode,
which is 30in. wide, carries a six- to nine-
inch seam of beryl on the hanging wall.
Assay value of metals being worked is
wolfram, 70 p.c. tungstic acid ; carbonate
of bismuth, 54 p.c. metallic bismuth.
Separation of these metals from the beryl,
topaz and zircon has presented little diffi-
culty.
Boulder’s 1933 figures compare favor-
ably with those of 1932, shown in paren-
theses. Value of production with pre-
mium and gold bounty added, £297,927
(£293,993); Australian and London ex-
penditure, £215,818 (£230,506); profit,
£82,109 (£70,950); divs., 37£ p.c. (25
p.c.). Ore reserves, actual, 278,008 tons
(204,792 tons); probable, 269,628 tons
(33,208 tons). The new sulphide mill is
expected to kick off in August. Old resi-
dues accumulated on the surface are esti-
mated at nearly 3,000,000 tons. Their
treatment is expected to yield a hand-
some profit.
Lake View's tonnage for June (49,933)
was the largest treated by any Westralian
co. to date. The yield was worth
£117,545 in emu-and-kangaroo cur-
rency. The July production of crudes is
expected to top the 50,000-ton mark.
* * * *
The Imperial Co. is preparing for the
installation of a treatment plant on its
barely-scratched mine at the south end
of the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile. The
shares recently soared from a few shil-
lings to over £2 on reports of rich ore,
and the board got £25,000 cash from
some moneyed people for 10,000 new
10s. shares.

B.A.N.Z. Mines, Ltd., which has
acquired several odds and ends in an
hitherto unfashionable part of the Kal-
goorlie field, looks hopefully to the
future. Lodes of “very nice appearance”
have been exposed, and lode material
“similar to Gt. Boulder” has been cut.
Hitherto the areas being prospected by
the co. have been regarded as duffers.
* * * #
Chairman Whitfield told North Kal-
gurli shareholders that if the co.’s bank
balance was found to be in excess of
business requirements a part return of
capital might be made. He added that
there had been a cycle of low ore values
recently, but considered that the mine
was in a very strong position under-
ground.
* * * *
Algy Moreing says that the Gwalia,
like other Westralian gold producers, is
largely dependent on the sterling price
of gold and exchange, and that there is
no cause for any apprehension of reduced
profits on account of either. The co.
has given the Swedish Electrical Pros-
pecting Co. the job of surveying areas
surrounding the mine in the hope that
something new might be indicated below.

Sir William Campion and Claude de
Bernales did all the talking at the Anglo-
Australian and Commonwealth Mining
and Finance roll-ups, and both pro-
claimed their steadfast belief in the
prospects of the holdings of the two
concerns. Commonwealth Mining and
Finance has the once-famou.s Bayley’s
Reward, Coolgardie (W.A.), in its basket.

Heppingstone and Palmer, after six
weeks’ work on a lease 15 miles north-
west of Yarri (W.A.), raised 45 tons from
50ft. for an average of 3oz. sdwt. over
the plates. Two other blocks have been
taken up near by, and both are on gold.
The reef is from 12in. to 15in. wide;
scarcely a company proposition.
* * *
Lake View South Extended has been
launched in Sydney to develop three
leases between the Lake View South and
Imperial, on the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile.
The mine has been opened up 500 ft.,
and it is hoped that two lodes, which
trend towards each other, will prove to
be very rich when they meet at depth.

The New Murchison, a Sydney concern
with a capital of £15,000, has secured
options in Westralia on the Yalelock, 45
miles north of Sandstone, which turned
out 355 tons averaging B|dwt. over the
plates ; the Mayflower, three miles from
Mt. Magnet, which yielded 601 oz: from
495 tons ; and the Strathmore, 13 miles
from the Great Fingall at Day Dawn.
C. Pearsell will direct development on
these shows.

A co. is being floated in the Eastern
States to resuscitate the old Bellevue
mine, near Lawlers (W.A.). This pro-
perty yielded a good tonnage in the
early days, but treatment was made diffi-
cult by the presence of copper. Over
195,000 tons was mined for 100,000 oz.
of gold. The ore-body has been proved
for a length of over 1700 ft., and the
mine has been opened up to a depth of
400 ft.
In June, Norseman (W.A.) crushed
2313 tons for 906 ounces of gold, and
cyanided 1938 tons of residues for 359
ounces. Estimated gross value of the
yield in Australian currency was £10,700.

Goldfields of Australia is the modest
title of a new float which will take over
the old Sons of Gwalia property at the
northern end of the Kalgoorlie field
(W.A.). The ground, which is south of
the old Devon Consols, has been opened
up- to 170 ft. In the past 1428 tons of
stone was taken out for 8440 z. of gold.

Central Mining and Investment, Ltd.,
one of the largest concerns in Africa,
holds a fair-sized wad of scrip in West-
ern Mining Corp. and a small interest in
Triton’s. It is said to be nibbling at
other Australian ventures.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Locality and extent of the Albert gold-
field ? (2) Is it alluvial or reefing ? (3) Pro-
duction ? (4) Geological formation ? —2582.
(1) Practically the whole of the West Dar-
ling district of New South Wales. Area approxi-
mately 40,000 sq. miles. (2) Both alluvial and
reef gold have been won, chiefly from fields
in the neighborhood of Tibooburra and Mil-
parinka (Mt. Brown). (3) Over 40,0000 z. In
addition, gold is recovered from the treatment
of silver-lead-zinc ores at Broken Hill. (4)
Rocks of several geological ages are present
within this vast area.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
R.E.: (1) Thus far the co., which means the
shareholders, derives its profits from selling
bonds, not timber; in the future, commission
earnings for work undertaken on behalf of
bondholders promise to be the chief source
of revenue. Bondholders depend for their
return upon net proceeds from the sale of
forest products... .(2) The capital and reserves
combined. The reserves consist of share pre-
miums and surplus earnings retained in the
business instead of being distributed among
shareholders. Reserves in the trading banks
have been accumulating for half a century or
more.... Shareholder: One for five is the most
equitable... .TJ.: Hold prospects of a further
rise in the price are encouraging... .J.R.T.:
(1) Suva, Fiji. (2), (3) and (4) See B.
27/6/’34, or “ ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly” for July,
1934.. .Debenture: Not recommended
J.P.: If safety of capital is important keep
out. See “ ‘Wild Cat’ Monthly” for June,
1934.. . .B.McG.: (1) There is no law in N. S.
Wales which makes surrender values obliga-
tory. (2) Yes. (3) Co. has' not yet turned
the corner. (4) Ask for a paid-up policy.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Selma”: My experience of a katipo
drama (B. 4/7/’34). I was visiting a
friend in Auckland (M.L.) when her hus-
band, who had been sun-baking on the
beach, arrived home and announced he
had been bitten on the wrist by a katipo.
His arm began to swell, he complained
of headache and sickness and added to
a deathly pallor an attack of shivering.
In the intervals of ringing up the doctor
we plied him with whisky and aspirin,
but he lapsed into a state of coma. “My
car has broken down,” the doctor
shouted ; “give him an emetic.” We had
just forced the last drop down the un-
happy victim’s throat when the quack
dashed in flourishing a stomach-pump.
He examined the arm, apologised about
the emetic, remarked that we had
the patient “so drunk it was impossible
to tell what he was feeling,” and retired
to make out his bill. An indignant
invalid came back to normal next day,
though the arm was swollen for a week.

“Boomslang”: Old shibboleths die
hard. Reporting the death in Ceylon
of an English soldier who tried to kill
a snake by catching it by the tail and
“That horse is not strong enough to carry two big people.”
"He carry three, boss. Jump up behind Mary.”
cracking its head off, the cable says that
the reptile “wriggled round and stung
him.” There is a host of folk, marching
in step with another which holds that
young kangaroos grow on mother’s teat,
which believes that snakes sting. Snakes
bite with their teeth, just like the gentle-
men one meets on the pavement outside
Sydney Tatts. on a race morning.
“R.R.M.”: “Bunny” (B. 18/7/’34)
errs ; those transplanted rabbits are still
fairly plentiful on Woody Island, in
Hervey Bay (Q.). Only two miles long,
the island supports about 400 goats, which
though stunted by years of inbreeding
are good mutton for the two lighthouse-
keepers. There is no fresh water on the
island, except that lying about after rain.
“Pandanus”: Not only goats and
rabbits were released on islands off the
Bananaland coast. A party of us found
fowls on the Howicks, east of Cape Mel-
ville ; they nested in the grass, were
long-legged, could run swiftly and fly
with ease. We shot one, but the flesh
had a wild flavor and was coarse and
unpalatable. These chooks were the
descendants of domesticated fowls left
on the islands years before by skippers
of Jap luggers.
* =i= * *
“Arachne”: In attempting to correct
me as to encouraging spiders as mosquito-
catchers about a house, “ Pollywoggle ’
(B. 25/7/’34) begs the question. He
pulls me up for referring to the female
spider who builds the web as a “gentle-
man.” That’s where he finishes. There
are never fewer than two or three of the
big “geometrical” webs strung on my
verandahs, which are enclosed with rose
and other vines. Mrs. Arachne does
allow them to build. She learned that
lesson long ago when, a newcomer to a
fever-stricken corner of Papua, she was
shown the hundreds of mosquitoes
caught overnight in one of the big webs
to which she had first objected.
t. * * *
“Cam Cove”: I’d have been out of
the Watson’s Bay (Sydney) baths ten
minutes sooner but for a dead penguin.
The little downy stray came in on a run
of waves before a westerly blow and
was washed through the battens at the
harbor end. He hadn’t been long dead,
for he was limp and had his eyes open.
Was he one of the Manly flock Aboliars
have been writing about, and, if so, what
caused him to give up the ghost?
* * * *
“Cuisse”: Protective armor was not
confined to European chivalry. In the
campaign against the Senussi in Western
Egypt I acquired a magnificent Arab
suit of chain mail which must have dated
back to the Moorish occupation of Spain.
A brutal and illegal search of officers’
luggage at Cook’s by the Cairo Provost
Marshal when we were all out in the
Sinai desert robbed me of the trophy. I
have been moved to these musings by
contemplation of a Gilbert Island war-
helmet ingeniously made from the dis-
tended body of the porcupine fish, with
the spikes all sticking outwards. This
was worn with the heavy coir armor
affected by the Gilbertians to minimise
the effect of the wooden swords and
daggers edged with sharks’ teeth which
were their favorite weapons. The old
Hawaiians had armor resembling this,
and their helmets closely resembled those
of the ancient Greeks, including the
heavy-arched crest. Most of the bow-
using tribes of Papua wear a wicker
“brassard” on the left arm, exactly like
the leather one the men of Crecy and
Poictiers used to take the snap of the
released bowstring. Some of them go
further and wear arrow-proof cuirasses
of closely-plaited wicker.

bench he stopped breaking up bumpers,
which he was blending in a tin. “Good

work in Townsville on account o’ th’

wind when they do a bit o’ climbin’, so
they drops their bumpers. How are yer,
Slipper? That’s Slipper Davis. Gamest

“(Jramao”: Maoriland ornithologists
are speculating on the circumstances re-
sponsible for the. casting up on their
shores of a bird that was never before
known to visit them—a shear-water, re-
lated to the mutton-bird. Its habitat is in
the Azores and the Canaries. In the
non-breeding season it travels as far as
the Cape.
“Pauw”: That yarn about the Riverina
plain turkeys being killed off by their
habit of eating grasshoppers, the horny
legs of which penetrated their
crops, leaves me cold. I
lived for years in a country-
side where the fine birds
flourished in thousands dur-
ing good seasons. About the
only food they ate when the
blue and Mitchell grasses
were saddle-high was the
swarms of grasshoppers.
They used to get so fat —the
turkeys, not the grasshoppers
—that in warm weather they
would sooner squat in the
long grass than fly when
danger threatened. Many a
time I have actually kicked
one up to get a flying shot,
and on one occasion was
with a shooting party in a
four - in - hand waggonette
which killed one of these
squatting birds by driving
over him —he even sat tight
as the horses passed within
an inch of him. but was
nailed by the offside wheels.
I cannot recall any instance
of the birds dying of peritonitis induced
by their grasshopper diet.

“Squalus”: A Mooloolah (Q.) fisher-
man recently had a nerve-racking ex-
perience. Fishing several miles offshore
late at night, he hooked an Bft. blue-
pointer shark. Getting it to the surface,
he reached overside to steady the head
while he got a rope round the body. The
shark seized his right hand, driving teeth
well into bones and sinews. He knew
that, if it twisted, his hand would be taken
off, and, leaving it for the brute to chew
on, coolly directed his companion to
fetch the gaff. With the handle he forced
the teeth apart sufficiently to drag the
mangled hand through their dagger-
points. His companion was a complete
novice with boats, so, after controlling
the bleeding somewhat, with his sound
hand he was obliged to start the engine
himself and steer the boat home. To
finish up, he drove his motor-truck six
miles to a doctor, and spent the hours
before morning in having every corner
of the complicated, jagged wounds
cleaned out with antiseptics. No risks
may be taken with shark teeth, for fear
of septic complications. As if this were
not enough misfortune, the next day his
son was badly burned in a petrol ex-
plosion on the boat and the craft itself
damaged.

land (where large trees are scarce) my
dog found a ’possum in a stump. I
threw him up a sapling and looked into
the hollow. There were two complete
skeletons there —a ’possum’s (on top) and
a snake’s. Mr. ’Possum presumably came
home to find a stranger in possession,
was bitten, but survived long enough to
fix the intruder. The second ’possum
couldn’t have been worried by ghosts.
“Tassie”: Mustering sheep on our islet
I had to handle a big Romney. Cosy
and warm in the folds of wool under the
neck was a ringtail ’possum about the
size of a kitten. The little ringie had
evidently strayed from his not-so-snug
possie on his mother’s back to the much
warmer one in the long wool of the old
Romney, whom he had found sheltering
in the timber during the night.

“Cooie-Bird”: I don’t think crows take
wing at night except when alarmed. The
disturber might be a native-cat or a
particularly hungry giant owl, the latter
preying on birds smaller than itself. That
“W.E.B.’s” crows (B. 27/6/’34) flew on
two successive nights suggests that the
scavengers were molested in camp. Same
thing happened in my locality on several
bright moonlight nights, the disturbed
cawers kicking up a tremendous row.
The time on each occasion was about ten
o’clock. Many small birds camp in among
the foliage at the extremity of the
branches, a single flutter taking them out
into the open when danger threatens.
Have known night birds to forage by
day, but never day birds to hunt for
tucker at night.
“Bitter Bark”: “Mulyan's” par. (B.
27/6/’34) about flying-foxes crawling
down sticks and logs to drink makes me
smile. I have seen flying-foxes drink on
several occasions. Each time they flew
out on to a sheet of water, and dipped
and rose to drink after the manner of
swallows, without alighting on anything.
FLOOD TIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The river rose full-flooded,
With moaning sad and low,
Where overhanging branches
Were swaying to and fro.
Rare desert pea glowed crimson
Where summer rains had been,
And wattle waved gold banners
From sandhills cloaked in green.
But at the valley homesteads
Were watchers through the night,
With carts and waggons laden
In readiness for flight.
And weary-eyed bushwomen
Waited by many a door
Till water crept like fingers
Across the earthen floor.
Round winding bends and reaches
Rode shepherds, side by side,
And drove their flocks to rptugc
Beyond the lasing tide.
Tall gum-trees swayed and toppled
And sank down silently,
But dry logs rode the current
As ships sail out to sea.
Out on the stream’s wide bosom
Full many things were borne,
With cloven feet turned skyward
And here and there a horn;
While, sinister and sullen,
The flood tide left its mark
High on the river giants
In circles on the bark.

“F.Y.7”: For Australia’s awfulest
smell outside politics let me nominate
the gidya-tree, classed only second by
“Spinifex” (B. 25/ 7/ ’34). I was born on
a Barcoo station where gidya grew
thickly. At ordinary times the leaves
were inoffensive, even if crushed. But
if rain was looming, then a miasma crept
over the countryside that sent all but the
accustomed hurriedly to seek privacy.
Blackall still recalls a gidya tragedy. It
was in the early ’eighties, and the annual
show and race-meeting fortnight was in
full swing. As always, the Bachelors’
Ball in the School of Arts was the social
event of that rather hilarious gathering.
Two of the bachelors, recent arrivals
from England, offered to decorate the
hall. This they did with festoons of
scarlet turkey-twill and the silver-grey
foliage of the gidya—a very pleasing
combination, as far as the eye went.
When the local nobility and gentry
gathered, there was high praise for the
artistic couple. Then a thunderstorm
zoomed up, and in ten minutes the gasp-
ing throng was fighting its way out of
the pestiferous hall and crying wildly for
the blood of the decorators. The late
Dick Stewart, Admirable Crichton of
those days, immortalised the happening
in verses which the “Queenslander” pub-
lished. No one reads Harrison Ains-
worth. nowadays, but Stewart’s lines were
a version of a ghastly song from “Rook-
wood,” the refrain of which ran “Mara-
natha, anathema, dire is the spell of the
Mandragora.” Stewart’s version was
“Maranatha, anathema, dire is the smell
of the gid-e-ya.” The two jackeroos—
one of them is still in the land of the liv-
ing—heard so much of this that they
could sing it in their sleep for years after.

“Clement’s Ghost”: Tell “Nepa” (B.
20/6/’34) that Lakekamu goldfield,
Papua, comes only a moderate third in
the race for the world’s wettest spot, and
Innisfail (N.Q.) is well back in the ruck.
Cherra Poonjee, in the Assam hills, has
an annual average rainfall of 424 inches,
but in several years of abnormal falls it
has almost hit the 650-inch mark. In
August, 1841, when 30 inches or more
fell on five successive days, the rain-
fall for the month was 264 inches.
The heaviest day’s fall, recorded
in 1876, was 40.8 inches, which is
also a world’s record, although Aus-
tralia can run it pretty close. Cro-
hamhurst, in the Blackall Range -
(Q.), had 35.71 inches on February
2, 1893.
“Wetzus”: Still talking about wet
spots? Milford Sound (M.L.) is in the
picture. Heavily-laden rain-clouds from
the east can’t get over the barrier of
mountains (5000 ft. to 6000 ft. high) to go
inland ; so they drop their bundles in the
one spot. Result—almost every other
day is a wet ’un. Last March a few of
us were tramping about for two hours,
and during that time nearly ten inches
of rain fell! The annual average is 260
inches.

“Herpeton”: That Hindu infant play-
ing with a cobra (B. 25/7/’34) was just
one of a mob. In Ipswich (Q.) a few
years ago a Mrs. Hearne found her little
son sharing his bread and jam with a
brown snake which crawled out of the
woodheap to meet him. Another of
these queer friendships was revealed
when a boy named Munro killed a black
snake in the family garden at Indooroo-
pilly, near Brisbane. This roused his
four-year-old sister to passionate grief
because he had killed her “pet worm.”
Yet another Queensland example was re-
ported from near Rockhampton. In this
case a small boy was seen to call a
snake from its retreat with a chirping
noise and then feed it. Other cases are
authentically reported, including two in
Westralia and one recently at Sydney’s
North Shore. Here the child was accus-
tomed to take its porridge down the
garden. Watched, it was seen that he
was sharing it with a snake which he
“If you eat any more, Billy, you’ll burst!” ,
“Okay, auntie. Pahss th’ cakes an’ stand clear.”
cuffed out of the way when it got too
greedy. A reading primer of my very
youthful days contained a piece of dog-
gerel in the worst Wordsworthian
manner. This told how a little girl always
ate her bread and milk out-of-doors.
She was watched, and was found feed-
ing and chastising the snake exactly as
in the North Shore happening.

“Bitter Bark”: Was surprised to read
of “Travel Stain’s” (B. 27/'6/’34) abo.

“All right, boss. Don’t rattle them.”
friend troubling to cut down a palm-tree
to relieve thirst. One slash with the
knife at the nearest lawyer-vine would
have released a plentiful supply of cool,
crystal-clear and tasteless water.
“J.M.S.”: Jackasses are mimics. In
Southport (Q.) recently I heard several of
the species in an old ironbark; one was
giving a remarkably good imitation of a
dog barking. There was no doubt about
it, as the performance was repeated
again and again, and each time the audi-
ence laughed heartily.

“Q. Bis.”: The outbreak of malaria
which has scourged North Westralia and
extended east to some of the islands in
Torres Strait, causing heavy mortality
among the blacks, is one of those hap-
penings which defy conjecture. Malaria
has always been endemic in the north of
the continent, but it never before assumed
the proportions of a plague. The variety
has been diagnosed as tertian, which lends
itself to complications, including self-
poisoning, dysentery and bronchial pncu-
monia—this form was responsible for
many deaths on the Papuan goldfields
30-odd years ago. Many authorities
ascribe the fall of Greek civilisation and
even that of the Roman Empire to ter-
tian malaria. It was well known in
Europe, where it is still endemic in many
places, including England, where it killed
Oliver Cromwell.

“Doug”: A Jersey cow at Te
Awamutu (M.L.) was born without a
tail. She has produced three calves, each
of which also lacks the usual fly- and
eye-swat.

“Buzzer”: Frogs may be playing the
dickens at Port Hedland (W.A.), as “John
Richards” states (B. 27/6/’34); but as a
plague I’ll back English bees gone wild
to give his frogs two stings and a beat-
ing. In the forest country around the
Towers district (N.Q.) during the ’23
drought every supply tank and every
trough had a skimming of drowned bees,
two and three deep, on its surface.
Presently the bees found out there were
waterbags hanging on the verandahs of
the station buildings. They’d gather
there and suck, and that bit of canvas
would only last a week or so. Bees were
everywhere, and, before the rains relieved
the situation, man, like the stock out
bush, had to fight his way to water and
get stung in the process.

“Mac Binghi”: “Cooie-Bird” (B.
11/7/’34) need not navigate as far as
Bananaland to find the sandpaper-fig. A
few miles north of Dungog (N.S.W.), in
the Barrington Brush, it grows to perfec-
tion. Old hands used the leaves for pol-
ishing up their carved whip-handles and
walking-sticks.
* * * *
“Isee”: “Tufi’s” bad Papuan steers-
man (B. 20/6/’34) reminds me of a trip
made up the n.-e. coast one night. A
“boy” considered capable was left in
charge of the wheel. When the skipper
took over again the launch had been
turned completely round and was head-
ing straight for home. The wind had
been blowing in the savage’s face; he
dozed, the wind changed, and on awak-
ening he found it blowing from behind
him, so, in confusion and panic, he
swung round into the wind again.

“Tidapa”: Despite “Spare Walton”
(B. 20/6/’34), fish don’t always swallow
their captures head first. Game fish
take their meals in exactly the opposite
manner. Pelagic fish, such as swordfish,
tuna and kingfish, rely solely on speed to
earn a living, and consequently must
take their captives from the rear. In troll-
ing for swordfish, the bait (down in the
Indian Ocean we use flying-fish) is
always arranged on the hook so as to
represent a fish slowly moving through
the water, and it is always grabbed from
the rear. The swordfish usually shows
himself following the bait for a few
seconds before he bites.

“Kooragai”: North Australian waters
contain many queer denizens, but noth-
ing surprises an angler more than the
blowfish, a sluggish swimmer that cruises
among rocks after shellfish. It has a
big bony beak that can crush an oyster
as if it were an eggshell. It doesn’t often
take a bait, but when it is hooked it in-
flates itself to many times its normal size.
The body is covered with spikes, or spiky
scales, nearly an inch long, and when
the inflated skin is taut they stand out
straight and stiff, giving the creature a
startling and formidable appearance.
Among its aliases are balloon-fish, puff-
ball and windbag.

“Spendthrift”: Australia seems to be
the world’s champion at making the
other fellow presents of valuable assets.
South Africa has benefited mightily from
our merino sheep and tanning wattles. The
eucalyptus-tree in one form or another
has been a godsend to countless coun-
tries. Treeless Abyssinia and South Africa
nowadays rejoice in forests imported from
Australia. California and other Western
U.S.A. States have been planting the
trees so long that it is difficult to convince
a local inhabitant that they are not in-
digenous. Spain and Algeria have ban-
ished malaria by planting the trees, which
absorbed the surface water in which mos-
quitoes bred, and both are making and
exporting eucalyptus oil and other pro-
ducts. The fever-ridden Pontine Marshes
near Rome are now a wheat-producing
area. Russia is the latest. In the closing
days of the Empire, huge forests were
planted in Transcaucasia. These were
tended throughout all the troubles, and
the Soviet is now reserving areas for oil-
making. Curious to note that here, and
here alone, the exiles have lost their
Australian individuality. They shed their
leaves in autumn and have become de-
ciduous.
MATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He took me aside before he went, and he said
“I’m telling you straight,
I m the sort of a kind of a man, me lad, that
never forgets a mate;
And if I get on to anything that looks like a
decent show,
Then you can take it from me, old man, that
you’ll be the first to know.
“You’ll find,” he said, “that I’m not like
some who’ll take all a mate can give,
And then forget him when they’re in luck.
But, there, wherever you live,
You’ll always run across chaps like that, a
poor old lot you’ll agree;
But, thank the Lord! I’m not that sort —you
can always depend on me.”
And that was nearly a year ago; and never a
word came through
Till I read of him in the local rag, which told
in a line or two
How he’d given an option on his claim, front
which he had done so well,
And also that he was on his way to Perth for
“a well-earned spell.”
Here’s hoping that he enjoys himself on his
holiday below!
Here’s hoping he gets the thirty thou, they say
he asks for his show!
Here’s hoping-—any amount of things; but
still, to give him his due,
He only said what they always say—and did
what they always do.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STRFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
FOR SMALL GRAZIERS.
J. J. Hardie, author of The Bulletin’s
new M.O.L. book, “Wool-Classing and
Shed Management,” is that rare bird
a practical man who can write. He
is a well-known woolclasser, and this is
a practical man’s volume designed to
serve the small grazier who builds and
manages his own shed and flock and
classes his own clip.
The book differs from all others of the
kind on the market in three respects. It
is short. It is extremely simple. And
it is meticulously detailed. Every phase
of the grazier’s job is dealt with—pre-
paration for shearing, shedhands’ duties,
merino, comeback and crossbred classing,
pressing and branding, lambs, crutchings
and dead wool, marketing, shearing
machinery (a special chapter written by
an expert, R. K. MacCulloch) and
general hints. There is a satisfactory
index, which it is particularly easy to use
because of its correspondence with the
headed paragraphs in the book.
Mr. Hardie’s chapters on classing are
sound and detailed. He handles not only
each wool section, but each type and size
of flock separately, aiming mainly at
helping the small grower to secure the
best prices with a minimum of labor.
His outline of technique is complete.
Take the handling of flocks of 1000 to
2000:
As the fleeces come to the table, class
them roughly into groups. Put all the big,
bulky strong fleeces in one heap. Make
another group of the average to best
quality fleeces of good to very good length,
and one of similar fleeces carrying heavier
condition. Keep apart any short-stapled
fleeces and all dingy, matted wools. The
average length of staple can only be deter-
mined by the man on the spot. It depends
altogether on the class of sheep, the
district and the season, so that your main
lines may range between 2in.-3in., 2)-in.-
4in., or 3in.-sin. When you feel you have
got the run of the wool, work the fleeces
into the bins, using the nearest, roomiest
bins for the main lines. That gives us the
following layout:
888. —Bulky, strong quality fleeces, any
condition except very rough or yellow.
Sound.
AAA.—Bright, light, finer fleeces of aver-
age to good length. Sound. This line
should be representative, of the clip, and
most of the fleeces should go into it.
AA. —Similar quality to AAA, but
shabbier in appearance and carrying more
condition, dust or color. Sound.
A. —All short-stapled fleeces. Sound.
First Fleece.—Tender fleeces.
And so on for four pages until all opera-
tions are fully explained. This is a book
which has been needed for half a
century. The wonder is that nobody
has written it before ; and, at the price,
it will pay the buyer if it adds the value
of three pounds of medium-quality
greasy to his next season’s cheque. (A

Management, by J. J. Hardie; The

TREATMENT OF FOOTROT.
“Rich. J.”: Where sheep footrot is
prevalent an adequate foot-bath is im-
portant. For the average grazier a bath
to treat about 40 sheep at once will suit.
First, the affected feet must be pared
and the sheep held in the solution for
a couple of hours, so as to allow the
antiseptic to penetrate. Just walking
sheep through the bath is useful as a
preventive, but is futile as a cure.
It is important that sheep be kept on
a dry surface —in a large shed —after
treatment. This gives the feet a chance
to harden,
Though bluestone is cheap and effec-
dve ’ its use invokes a b.g risk of staining

CORRIEDALE SHEEP,
“ E anus” ; There was a great display
of Corriedales at the recent Show,
and was noticeable at the sales
tba t the best prices were paid for animals
Q f be original pure Maoriland blood
from the original Corriedale flock,
s t ar ted with Lincoln rams on merino
ewes The name “Corriedale” has been
applied to a number of crossbred flocks
G f varying origins ; but the sales brought
it home that purity of blood counts for
more than points.
j b j s questionable whether any flock
G f b er than pure descendants of the
originals is entitled to the name “Corrie-
daie>”
About 15 years ago the Australian
Corriedale Sheepbreeders’ Association
was formed, and later a flock-book was
P cf a hlkhed for the “Pure Corriedale
estawisnea tor tne pure
Breed of Sheep in all the States. The
rules of the association provide that only
flocks of pure Corriedale sheep shall
be eligible for registration; a pure
flock was defined as being the progeny
of registered Corriedale sheep. Amusing
to find, on reference to the flock-book,
that, whereas the original flock was
founded in 1874, some registered flocks
were originated by crossing various
breeds as late as 1908.
SEX IN CATTLE.
“W.D.Mc.”: At Wagga (N.S.W.) my
father once bought a pure shorthorn cow
with a bull-calf at foot from H. M.
Bayliss, owner of a well-known herd and
parent of one of the greatest modern
shorthorn judges. The calf developed
into a beautiful bull, but he had a most
effeminate head with fine, curly horns
just like a cow. We kept him for four
years, and during that time he never
sired a male calf. When we left the
district he was sold to a neighbor, and
revisiting Wagga some years later I was
able to pick out all his progeny by the
curly horns that they inherited. Since
then I have bred and handled a good
many thousand cattle, but have never
had another like him, and I often wished
I had.
AUSTRALIAN BEEF.
“Bendee”: One of many reasons why
our beef is not up to sample is that
steers are allowed in too many cases to
lose their milk fat when taken off their
mothers.
Steers should always be weaned into
good country, for once they lose that
milk fat they will never regain the quality
in the beef. In Scotland, where they
do produce good beef, calves are fed
on oats before they are weaned, so that
there will be the minimum setback at
that time. Afterwards, the turnip is a
substantial feature of their diet. This
may not be practicable in Australia just
yet, but some day we shall come to it.
Droughts must be combated by pro-
vision of grass stacks, or any other form
of roughage, for once cattle get down
in condition they lose bloom and suc-
culence, which they will never properly
regain, and will be of no use for export
in competition with the world’s best.
Breeding from “mickeys” or scrub
bulls is another sure way of getting
stringy beef of the worst quality.
For overseas trade we must breed
stock that will make 6001 b. to 7001 b. in
from two to three years’ maximum, and
we can do it if we breed right and feed
right, and have paddocks arranged so
that cattle can get a drink without
travelling themselves poor.
SUMMER FODDERS.
“Rich. J.”: It is a good plan in sow-
ing summer fodder crops to staitt prepar-
ing the ground now. The short period
under fallow builds up a store of
moisture, liberates plant foods in the
soil and at the same time brings the
ground into tip-top condition for the
spring sowing.
Japanese millet is a popular summer
fodder crop, being a remarkably quick
grower and coming again rapidly after
being fed off. Sow at the rate of 301 b.
broadcast and 151 b. in drills. I have always
obtained best results with a sowing of
about 201 b. in drills under irrigation, but
Kooba (Riverina) is sowing this year,
under irrigation, 4000 acres with 20 tons
of millet.
Among the sorghums, Sudan grass
stands out. It is not a pasture grass,
which is either a perennial or self-seeding
annual.
Sudan grass should be sown down
every year in a good seed-bed with a fair
amount of moisture to ensure rapid ger-
mination. Though a slow grower at the
start, it becomes one of the best drought-
resisters among summer fodders.
I have found it invaluable as silage,
and have averaged a cut of over two tons
of hay per acre. If sown in drills two
feet apart 81b. per acre is a good allow-
ance, with 161 b. to 201 b. per acre when
broadcast.
Early grazing invigorates the roots and
encourages stooling.
Saccaline, Early Amber cane, Planter’s
Friend and grain sorghum —in districts
with a limited rainfall —are all to be
recommended.
CLOVER IN THE WHEAT BELT.
“Byron”: In dry areas stock suffer
through lack of protein feeds. The
natural herbage is carbonaceous —all
bread and no meat. The wheat-belt
stockowner looks with covetous eyes on
the clover country and knows that if he
could get one of the large leguminous
family of protein plants to grow his
fodder troubles would be mitigated.
At Narrogin (W.A.), Tom Hardie and
Sons, of Rosedale, where some of the
best merinos and Ayrshires are run, have
solved the problem of growing clover in
an 18in. rainfall area.
Rosedale is a 6000-acre farm and has
now over 1000 acres of clover, yielding
upwards of two tons of hay per acre.
Each year about 200 tons of clover silage
is made. The procedure is to lightly
disc-plough about 250 acres each year
and sow with 401 b. of oats and 41b. of
sub. clover seed, using about 901 b. of
superphosphate per acre.
The oats shelter and protect the young
clover in the first year, and the crop is
harvested, leaving the clover undisturbed.
In the second year, a liberal dressing
of super, is applied in the autumn, and
as a general rule in the spring the clover
stands 15in. high and makes a wonderful
amount of growth, which is either fed
off or cut for hay. In the third year the
fields are top-dressed and become firmly
established with growth above the knees.
RABBIT CONTROL.
“A.G.T.”: “Valerin” (B. 27/6/’34) is
stating facts. Fumigation is not as effec-
tive as it might be. On large areas it is
too expensive.
During a long period in badly-infested
country, using poison-cart, cynogas fumi-
gation, etc., I favor only poisoned water
and trapping.
A neighbor who has kept a boy trap-
ping the whole season has cleaned the
pest out of 3000 acres of sandy, netted
country.
To effect control by this method a
property should be netted as soon as
possible. Don’t delay because there are
few rabbits ; it is easier to get the few.
Next, have all watering-places netted
so that rabbits water only when you
want them to. During the warm
months allow them access to water for
a period, and then, closing them off for
a day or two, to poisoned water. Lastly,
the trapping should be done thoroughly.
TETANUS IN HORSES.
“El V.”: Tetanus (lockjaw), as com-
mon in sheep and horses as in man, is
one of the most difficult diseases to treat
and one about which there is much
error and superstition.
In a horse it is easy to recognise.
Joints and muscles stiffen, the mouth
becomes difficult to close and the animal
has a curious, tense position, with the
tail stuck straight out like a broom. If
these symptoms are evident, raise the
horse’s head, and if the third eyelid is
across the eye the disease may be taken
for granted.
Physic is little use. If the animal has
not sufficient stamina to get over it him-
self, all the tail cutting, bleeding and
abracadabra will do no good. Just turn
the victim into a clean, shady paddock
and, if he can eat, give him linseed gruel
mash and a bucket of skimmed milk with
some eggs beaten into it. Put a few
ounces of Epsoms into his feed or drink
and leave him to it. If he cannot stand
up, put him out of his misery. Once
down, he will never rise again.
The best cure is prevention. Anti-
tetanus serum is available and should be
in every farm chest where horses are
doing heavy work. When they receive
a bad scratch or wound from a rusty
nail or in other circumstances which sug-
gest that tetanus may ensue, an injection
under the skin of the neck will usually
proof an animal against the conse-
quences.
MANURING THE ORCHARD.
“6Q.J.”: When to manure is as im-
portant as how to manure in an orchard.
Phosphoric manures should be applied
to act at from eight to ten weeks after
the bud burst. This will mean that the
fruit, and not the leaves or weeds, will
derive the greatest benefit from the
super, or other fertiliser. Nitrogenous
manures tend to delay maturity, and an
excess of nitrogen not only softens the
growth, which exposes the tree to fun-
goid diseases, but makes citrus fruit
soft, pithy and puffy.
Weed growth and leguminous crops
should be encouraged in the autumn and

HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“A.G.T.”: A plate-glass mirror makes
a good surface plate to true up
machinery parts where precision is neces-
sary.
“Sugar”: Never dig the lime into soils,
as it sinks too soon. Dig the soil first,
then place the lime on top. (Now or in
the spring is the best lime.) Point it in
with the fcrk, and the depth of soil dug
will benefit.
“J.A.S.”: The wiliest dingo seems
unable to resist a fishy bait. The stronger
smelling it is, the better. Tinned
kippered herrings, sardines and crab are
all good. Powder the strychnine and
prepare the baits with the usual precau-
tion of keeping your hands off it. A
fishy scent may be laid to the baits by
dragging some unbaited fish tied in a
muslin bag behind your horse.
“Pompey”: Strong and serviceable slip-
rail holders can be made from old horse-
shoes. Heat, straighten and sharpen the
prongs, and drive into the gateposts.
“Jack Point”: In winter a small feed
of wet mash is appreciated by.the fowls
first thing in the morning. If it can be
mixed with skim milk, so much the
better.
“Sugar”: If your working horses suffer
with dirty, badly-cracked heels, wash
carefully with lukewarm water and a good
soap. Dry with a clean rag, and apply
lanoline, sweet oil, or, better still, a
little white precipitate ointment.
“Swinger”: It is impossible to strain
a wire with a figure-8 knot with a
straight pull. Having tied the knot,
strain the wire as tight as possible. Plug
it. Go back along the wire and —mid-
way for preference—take the wire and
pull at right angles to the line of the
fence. That will slip the knot up tight
to the last fraction of an inch. Go back
to the straining point. Take out the
plug. Strain again and complete in the
usual way.
“Curlew”: A useful level may be made
from two pieces of 3 x 1 hardwood 3ft.
long. Bolt them together with three small
bolts at right angles, having planed the
base of the board forming the T per-
fectly level. Stand the level on two
pieces of wood approximately level. A
plumbob hanging from the centre of the
upright piece is allowed to swing freely.
Mark on the bottom board its position.
Reverse the ends of the level on the
blocks and again mark the position of
the string. Mark now midway between
these two, and the correct position is
shown when the base is on a dead level.
The string must swing freely, but a D
near the plumbob will keep it from sway-
ing too far.
“Deekay”: In a disc plough or culti-
vator try using one part common fat,
minus salt, and one part crankcase oil.
This has to be melted to be poured into
the bearings, but quickly sets like grease
and therefore lasts much longer.
“Snorter”: If a harnessed saddle horse
breaks away let him have his run. If
checked and caught while still enjoying
himself, he will always repeat his
escapade. On one N.Q. station there was
a rip-van-snorter always in trouble. He
had pulled away and been caught a
couple of times. Then he was let go.
That horse was away all night with the
saddle. He came home next day looking
like a whipped pup, and from then on
he could not be induced to rove. If a
buggy horse gets away with its harness,
use the same treatment.
“R.J.A.”: To detect incipient lame-
ness in a foreleg have the horse slowly
trotted towards you. His head will bob
every time the sound leg comes to the
ground. For the hind leg, as he is trotted
away the sound hock will rise higher and
sink lower than the lame one. Practice
is essential to determine whether the
foreleg or the diagonally opposite hind
one is at fault. Regard the foot as the
seat of lameness till evidence shows it
to be elsewhere. Most lameness occurs
at or below the knee or hock.
“Bunchytop”: “W.M.8.” (B. 20/6/’34)
doesn’t impress. The rule in Fiji is to
grow a sucker from a sucker. Thus the
new sucker never has to battle for a
living; when it bunches it throws a
second-year bunch, which, as any
banana-grower knows, is greatly superior
to a maiden bunch. Further, the secret
of good banana-growing, apart from
keeping down the weeds, is ruthless
pruning.
“J.P.”: Maize is better winter grain for
poultry than wheat. In a grain mixture
increase the maize and decrease the other
grains, but don’t change suddenly from
wheat to maize. Cracked maize, prepared
as required, is preferable to whole.
“Pineneedle”: Don’t lose your old hoe
heads. Bore holes in the worn blade
and it can be screwed to the top of your
gate post, with the eye as a gate pin. When
making the gate use a piece of 3 x 2
hardwood as an upright and taper it to
fit the eye. A beer-bottle upside down
in the ground makes a good thimble to
sit the gate in.
“Gundy”: To get a uniform line on
the tops of fencing posts when crossing
uneven country, put a mark on the
rammer at the required height. After
erecting two posts, sink the third hole
and drop the post in. Then stand the
rammer on the site of the next post and
sight back by the mark and tops of
posts. If crossing a rise, keep the last
post slightly above line ; if a depression,
correspondingly below it. Slight irregu-
larities of ground-line, such as plough-
furrows, stump holes or ant-beds, should
be disregarded. A variation of an inch
or so in the height when crossing sharp
cones or depressions will improve the
appearance of the job and make it easier
to thread and strain the wires.
“A.G.T.”: Box spanners for awkward
nuts are quickly made from iron pipe.
Select a size a shade smaller than the
nut, heat till red, then drive-on to the
nut, hammering the sides till they con-
form to the shape of the nut. Don’t
hammer when cold; it may split the
Pipe.
“Bismark”: Hollow logs, which arc
often wastefully burnt, make good salt
troughs. Cut out part of the side of the
log so as to leave the top as a hood to
protect the salt from the rain. The stock
have free access from the side. Divide
the log into two parts, and put coarse
salt into one side and sterilised bone-
meal into the other. It is best not to
mix them.
“Sandy”: To remove casein from
buckets and cans, use hot water with a
pinch of soda in it and rub the sides
with a housewife’s coppered potcloth. Do
not use a steel scrub or you soon will
be faced with the expense of retinning.
“Alex.”: A healthy spider eats three
and a half blowflies a week, and about
60 spiders would build webs in a large
box-tree. A result of the wholesale tree
destruction has been the growth of the
blowfly pest.
“Dead Finish”: “Haddington” (B.
27/6/ ’34) is certainly correct regarding
the nutritive value of bull Mitchell seed.
Big stock —cattle and horses —do remark-
ably well on the grass and seed, while
sheep will nibble all round the lower
parts of the bushy growth and hold their
condition. Have seen horses looking like
corn-feds nominated for grass-fed meet-
ings out of a paddock where the bull
Mitchell has been running into ear. One
person interested in the grazing business
in Queensland is endeavoring to cross
Mitchell grass seed with wheat. It is a

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
How can I prevent white ants from killing
my young orange-trees ? They are in their
second-year growth. —2611.
Cut out the damaged wood if possible. Avoid
scarring the trees near the base, as scars are
likely to induce white-ant attack. Dead or
dying infested trees should be removed and
burnt. Where the roots are attacked the use
of paradichloro-benzene or some other fumi-
gant is suggested. This will destroy the white
ants attacking the roots and in the adjacent
soil, and will act for a time as a preventive.
To apply the paradichlor, dig a circular trench
3 to 4 inches deep at a distance of 6 inches
from the trunk of the tree and scatter 2oz.
of the fumigant on the bottom of this, after-
wards filling in with soil. The fumigant is
more active when the soil is warm than when
it is cold, and is not effective when the soil is
saturated with water. For young trees a dose
of loz. is sufficient. If necessary, the treatment
should be repeated. The dosages must be
measured carefully, as excess is likely to kill
or damage the tree.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
Xl.—The Rum Punch Rebellion.
Apart from the rebellion against the
Board of Control in 1912, the most
spirited revolt in Australian history
occurred in the early days of N.S.W.
The regiment concerned was known as
the Rum Corps, from the liking of its
officers for that liquor —a liking that is
easy to understand, as there was no beer
in the country in those days.
One of the officers concocted a won-
derful liqueur which rapidly became
popular in the ranks. The recipe was
simple: Two kegs of old rum, 2 kegs
of new rum and the juice of 1 orange.
This was called rum punch, and was
very potent —due no doubt to the
vitamins in the orange juice.
This they sold to the public at a great
price, and by dint of good advertising
(they originated the slogan: “Army rum
has a kick like a mule”) their sales and
profits became enormous, and the
brewery which Gov. King founded in
opposition went bankrupt. The fact that
a brewery could go bankrupt shows how
barbarous the times were.
Then came Gov. Bligh, whose favorite
beverage was a drink distilled from
breadfruit. He attempted to combat the
Rum Trust by distributing this free
among the colonists. This was known
as Bligh’s Bounty, but people realised
that there must be a catch in anything
free, and they wouldn’t touch it.
Rum sales grew and grew. Rum was
used for everything.
Admission to the
theatres cost half a
gallon, and at
church the collec-
tion was taken up
in a bucket. A
reasonably good
wife could be pur-
chased for a four-
gallon keg, and if
she didn’t prove up
to expectations you
could pass her
back in exchange
for the empty
barrel.
Yet amid all this
abundance the
Governor couldn’t
get a noggin. Not
a soul would stand
him a drink. The
bootleggers would
have no dealings
with him, and his
efforts to get the
rum-punch recipe
were unsuccessful.
To make matters
worse, his bread-
fruit crop failed. Is
it any wonder
Bligh’s spirits were
low?
At the same time
nothing could
justify the action
he took. He de-
cided that if he
couldn’t control the rum he could at
least control the water, so he issued a
proclamation forbidding any man to
take water in his rum. Of course, no
one really wanted to spoil good spirits
in this fashion, but the edict struck at
the very roots of Australian liberty. Led
by the Rum Corps, the whole colony
was up in arms. Free rum was the order
of the day, and the Corps swore they’d
leave no barrel unbroached to get Bligh
out of the country.
The Rum Punch Rebellion was a
bloodless affair. Armed with spigots, the
soldiers removed the Governor from
office and gave him the choice between
being drowned in a barrel of rum or
deported in a Yankee limejuicer. He
selected the latter, and chose rather
wisely, because they only intended to
use low-grade rum in any case.

PARDONABLE.
The opening of Parliament with prayer
is an excellent gesture. The reading of
the burial service over some of our
Parliaments would be still more appro-
priate. Nevertheless, we have a deep
and sympathetic understanding for poor
old Blitherbleat, M.L.A., who uncon-
sciously added a power of truth to his
piety when his bull-like roar was heard
imploring all to “Let us bray!”

FOURTH DIMENSION.
“A Japanese inventor plans an aerial torpedo
which, fired from Japan, could reach Europe.
It will attain a speed of 5000 miles per hour.
The cost will be £3OOO.” — Cable.
Professor Wotherspoon is worried.
There are several things he wants to
know. Firstly, supposing the gun is
fired on Moscow. As the torpedo will be
travelling much faster than the earth is
rotating it will reach its objective some
time before the gun is actually fired. Can
the Japanese be held responsible by the
League of Nations for
destruction which has
already happened before
they press the button?
Again, in the event of
Japan’s declaring war on
Russia and immediately
launching her torpedoes,
the first broadside will
have done its fell work
before the ultimatum is
issued. Will this be a
breach of international
law, or merely an unavoid-
able accident? For, if the
Japs decide to stick to the
rules and wait until their
ultimatum has been duly received, the
Russians, using a similar weapon, may
get in first, and a torpedo landing in
Tokio may blow the Diet to smithereens
while it is framing the declaration.
It’s a very difficult problem. No
wonder the professor is worried.
Further, suppose Australia adopts this
invention and launches a torpedo attack
on Nicaragua, and then, before the
gadget reaches its objective, decides that
£3OOO is rather a high price for the long-
range fireworks.
Will it be too late to recall the pro-
jectile and not fire it after all? If so,
which action happens first, and which is
the final decision?
Finally.... No! That’s enough.
Uco.

AUGUST IN THE GARDEN.
The wet, fine, cloudy and sunny pros-
pects of this month should find the en-
thusiast out in the garden with the
flappers. There should be plenty of
time between the last spot and stumps
scores to get the ground ready for any
specimens of Felis domestica you can get.
Plant them deeply to prevent trouble
with the health inspectors.
Where water is still lying after the
rain, a strong catamaran is useful and
decorative. For angles and corners there
is nothing better than a theodolite. Ask
your seedsman if he has angina pectoris.
He may not. But he may have erysipelas,
pyorrhoea, mammitis or diphtheria ; if so,
tell him to keep them.
Start cutting down salaries and wages
again, and don’t forget that the double-
headed penny is nice to have if you want
to make money out of your favorite pas-
time. Don’t overlook the politicians.
They need rooting out. And don’t for-
get your aitches. In suburban gardens
you will find plenty of callithumpians
and skypoos. Plenty of young stock
from the latter, too.
For very hot and sunny positions a
Chinese umbrella is appropriate. When
it is cold and bleak choose a wolverine,
skunk, platypus or other type of fir.
Most gardeners have rheumatism this
month.

THIS CRICKET.
When Scotland threw down the
gauntlet to play a Test match against
the Australians at Aberdeen a stout piece
of string was attached to the gauntlet-
just in case.
That cricket is gaining in favor at
Aberdeen is amply demonstrated by the
13,000 gimlet holes bored through the
fence of the playing-ground. The Aber-
deen police prohibited the use of a real
coin in the toss. Hospital accommoda-
tion at this city is somewhat restricted.
The concrete ball and steel-faced bats
chained to the wicket rather disconcerted
the Australians. Economy is still the
watchword in Scotland. Apart from
“Aberdeen throat,” “Glasgow elbow”
and “Highland thirst,” the Scottish team
“I’ve heard her dearest friend say she’s
not all there.”
suffered from nothing serious enough to
prevent such a glorious opening display
that Aberdonian bottle merchants
cheered to the echo. Echo answered
“Say when!”
Play was repeatedly held up whilst two
steam-rollers and one steam-shovel re-
paired the damage done to the ground
by the tracks of the drink waiters.
When Australia suggested a tea
adjournment a nasty situation developed,
Scotland leaving the field boiling with
indignation and Mountain Dew.

And then there is that other one about
the Scotchman who had the bathroom
painted a warm color so that the bath-
heater could be dispensed with.
THE SPARTAN.
He was a sort of hero to me. When
the wind put its icy fingers through your
hair and down the back of your neck
there was a jovial smile on his face ;
the beating rain never damped his good
spirits. He seemed to like it. With the
raindrops pouring from his overcoat he
would remark: “Beautiful weather! I
can stand all of it that they send us.”
No weather grumbles from him! He
enjoyed the worst that Nature could
send. A superman!
And then I discovered the secret. He
is the maker of Cowley’s Cough Cure!

Butchers who are only skin and bone;
Ms.H.R. whom salary-grabbing vexes;
Prima donnas under fourteen stone;
Bridge fiends who prefer to play with

Boys who don’t consign the boss to

Golfers who, in bunkers, never swear;

Information Sought.
(1) How many fights did Lcs Darcy have
during his ring career, and how many did he
win, draw and lose ? (2) Did he fight in
A merica ? If so, whom, and with what result ?
(3) Did he fight other than as a middleweight ?
(4) Where, when arid from whom did he win
the world’s middleweight championship ? (5)
Is it a fact' that Darcy was beaten by a priest
from a Sydney college when in his prime ?
2567.
(1) After winning several tournaments at
Newcastle in 1910-11, Darcy had 44 fights for
40 wins and four losses. (2) Not publicly.
There is a story that he beat Fred Fulton
in a private fight in New York, but it has
never been authenticated. (3) Before beating
Englishman Jack Clark at Newtown Olympia
on January 5, 1914, Darcy fought as a welter-
weight, but he grew into a heavy middleweight
later, and was hard put to it to make list. 41b.
(the middleweight limit then) in 1916. (4) It
was supposed that Darcy won the world’s
middleweight championship at the Sydney
Stadium on December 27, 1915, from Eddie
McGoorty. Authorities overseas never recog-
nised the Darcy-McGoorty contest as a cham-
pionship, however. Neither American nor
British record-books mention that Darcy was
ever middleweight champion of the world.
(5) Nothing known about it.
(1) Suitable fall for an earth tennis court ?
(2) Height of net ? —2575.
(1) Three- to four-inch fall from one end
of the land to the other, or lin. to l|in. fall
from the centre towards each side. (2) Three
feet at the centre and 3ft. 6in. at the posts.
(1) I have a D.8.8.L. 12-gauge gun of Bel-
gian make which is marked on left barrel 18.3
• —18.2, and on right barrel 18.3. Both barrels
are also marked 12.65 in a G. Which is the
greatest choke ? (2) Best oil to use on guns ?
(3) Method of removing lead from barrels ?
(4) In reloading shells, is it advisable to press
candle grease in with the shot ? (5) What
charges should be used in reloading ? (6) Is
it possible to use .410 shell in 12-gauge guns
hv means of an adaptor ? —2552.
(1) The markings are not correct indications
of the choke, and the barrel muzzles would
need to be measured. The left barrel in a
d.-barrel gun is generally the choke barrel, the
right being either modified or cylinder. (2)
Burr’s Threeo. (3) Apply Burr’s oil, allow it
to remain in the gun for a few days and then
use a steel brush. B.S.A. safety paste is also
a good preparation for removing leading. (4)
No. (5) For cartridges the charge is
3dr. of powder and l|oz. shot; for 2£in.
cartridges, 3£dr. of powder and \\oz. shot.
(6) No. No such adaptors are made.
(1) Is the lower price for farm implements
in Australia, as compared with prices in M.L.,
attributable to higher tariff protection ? (2)
How does tariff protection affect the cost of
world commodities in general ? —2314.
(1) It is attributable to the fact that Protec-
tion has enabled the establishment of a very
efficient industry, affording opportunities for
the talents of Australian inventors and work-
men of which farmers are sharing in the bene-
fits. (2) In general, it enables manufacturers
to obtain a higher price for their commodities
in their domestic markets than they could
obtain if subjected to free competition.
(1) What is the market for molybdenite?
(2) What would be the payable ore content for
surface mining in N. S. Wales, irrespective of
transport costs ? (3) Are there any ore buyers
who deal specially in such metals in Australia ?
—2034.
(1) The latest London quote is 355. per unit,
or £l4B 15s. per ton, for 85 per cent, content
ore. (2) Several factors, such as the size,
type, location and composition, would have to
be considered to determine what would be pay-
able ore. (3) Buyers are O. T. Lempriere and
Co., Macquarie-place, Sydney; F. Hambridge,
Bridge-street, Sydney; and L. Burkard, 250
Pitt-street, Sydney.
A friend is applying for a N.S.W. hawker’s
license, and asks me to be his bondsman
together with another man. What is my liability
if I do so ? —2540.
Where the license is to carry wares for sale
by packhorse or cart or boat, the applicant
must enter into a recognisance, with two sure-
ties in £2O each, to conform to the provisions
of the Act. The surety is liable to the amount
named for any breach of the Act. committed
by the hawker.
(1) What redress has the author of a pub-
lished work when his publisher persistently
neglects to pay royalties due ? (2) If author’s
contract provides for payment of royalties on
certain dates each year, and publisher fails to
pay royalties or to account for copies sold, in
spite of frequent visits by author, could pub-
Usher's defect be termed a breach of contract ?
(3) If author was bound by contract to deliver
further works to such defaulting publisher,
would he be deemed guilty of breach of con-
tract if, after such treatment, he offered lus
work to another publisher ? —2535. .
(1) and (2) If the publisher contracted in
writing to pay royalties on all sales ol the
book he could be sued for breach of conti act,
or, alternatively and less expensively, sued m
the Small Debts Court for the money due. (3)
Breach of the contract by the publisher would
not justify breach by the author.
In a Melbourne paper recently it was stated
that a solicitor there “has received a notification
that the Archbishop of Canterbury has been
graciously pleased to appoint him a notary
public.’’ Why the Archbishop of Canterbury ?
—2465.
In England at the time of the Reformation
the power of “granting faculties,” which had
belonged exclusively to the Pope, was assumed
by Henry VIII., and a Court of Faculty was
called into existence, attached to the see ol
Canterbury, to which appointment of notaries
was delegated. The same procedure still exists,
and theMolarial Faculty of to-day commences:
“Cosmo Gordon by Divine Providence Arch-
bishop of Canterbury Primate of all England
and Metropolitan by authority of Parliament
lawfully empowered for the purposes herein
written,” etc. The seal bears the inscription:
“Faculty Seal of His Grace of Canterbury by
Statute of Henry VIII.”
(1) What is premium per cent, of insured
value against total loss in the case of a vessel
classed A\ at Lloyd’s, and how is it paid ?
(2) To what extent does the shipowner
insure cargo against damage and losses ? (3)
What would be insurance premium per
cent, against loss or damage of a bagged
cargo of flour if the ship were loaded to the
satisfaction of the insurance co.’s surveyor ?
(4) Would it be necessary to take out two
policies, one against damage and the other
against loss in transit ? How would premiums
be paid ? (5) How is freight and anticipated
freight insured ? What are the premiums and
how payable ? —2456.
(1) Rate depends on tonnage, trade, flag,
ownership, etc., and varies considerably. (2)
The shipowner’s liability in this regard is fre-
quently taken care of by one or other of the
protection and indemnity associations to which
most steamship cos. subscribe. They pay on a
tonnage basis. (3) and (4) It is usual for flour
to be insured with the special flour “all-risks”
conditions, and these clauses, with certain reser-
vations, cover both loss and damage in transit.
The premium would be payable on a percen-
tage basis of the insured value, and would be
influenced by the voyage, steamer, etc. (5)
Prepaid freight is usually included in the
amount of insurance secured by the shipper,
and therefore bears the rate applicable to the
cargo. Freight payable at destination may be
earned “ship lost or not lost,” if this is in
accordance with the contract of affreightment.
Where this position obtains, the freight is
usually included in the insurance on the goods.
On the other hand, such freight may be pay-
able on “out-turned quantities,”, in which cas.
both shipowner and cargo-owner may suffer
loss. “Anticipated freight” concerns the ship-
owner only. For instance,, a vessel may proceed
in ballast to Adelaide to load wheat. If she
is a total loss' during the voyage to Adelaide,
the shipowner loses his anticipated .freight. He
frequently protects himself by taking out insur-
ance. It is impossible to indicate what the
premium would be, as this is influenced by
many factors, such as the classification, age
and construction of the vessel, the voyage con-
cerned, the time of year, ownership, flag and
so on.
(1) What firm in Melbourne could advise
me about starting a lending. library in a
northern Vic. town ? (2) Capital needed ? (3)
Qualifications ? —2609.
(1) Robertson and Mullens. (2) Roughly,
£5O to purchase nucleus of 300 books, though
less would be required if books were carefully
chosen. There are many second-hand dealers
in the Eastern Markets, Melbourne. (3) Ability
to judge people’s tastes and a general know-
ledge of the nature of your goods.
Method of polishing furniture with orange
shellac ? —2461.
If the wood is very open or cracked, plaster
of Paris mixed with water is rubbed in and
smoothed off quickly before it has time to set;
if the wood is very dark in color, the plaster
should be tinted with a litttle Vandyke or
other- brown to match. If the wood is not
open enough to require plaster, it can be lightly
filled by a good dressing of beeswax dis-
solved in turpentine, well rubbed in and
polished with a woollen rag. Shellac dissolved
in methylated spirit is then applied with a
brush. When dry it gives a very bright polish,
which will withstand a great deal of wear.
(1) Current and voltage required for the
“Quasi” arc-welding process ? (2) Method of
regulating the current ? (3) Cost of generator
and regulator ? (4) Where procurable ? (5)
Names of books on the subject ? —2275.
(1) Starting voltage, 70; working voltage,
25; maximum current, 200 amperes. (2) The
welding current is roughly adjusted to suit the
work in hand by a four-pole switch; which
controls a number of counter series field turns
in circuit, these varying the “droop” of the
generator. Finer adjustments are obtained by
a rheostat connected in the shunt field cir-
cuit. (3) £l5O complete, including regulator.
(4) E.S.C.A., Edward and Charlotte streets,
Brisbane, or R. Bryce and Co., 414 Kent-street,
Sydney. (5) Operator’s instruction-book is
supplied with the plant.
How are pneumatic-tube systems operated ?
—2359.
Attached to the ends of the cylinders that
slide in the tubes are pads which exactly fit
the tube, thus preventing escape of air. Power
is supplied by electric motors which create a
current of air at a low pressure. There are
two tubes in each line of the system, one for
each direction of delivery. A spring lid at the
receiving end closes after a cylinder has been
discharged. In elaborate systems an attach-
ment of metallic discs is fastened to the front
of the carrier. At the point of discharge
machine is placed, having two metallic P encl
attached to the front. These are placed so
as to catch only the carriers for that station,
passing all other carriers. This system is known
as the Batchelier pneumatic-tube system. Other
systems are the Siemens and the Lorex.
(1) About when did the first case of flu
occur during the 1919 epidemic m N.S.W ./
(2) When was the peak, of the epidemic
reached? (3) About when in that year did
the epidemic begin to abate ? 2207.
(1) A patient who arrived overland from
Melbourne on January 23, and was reported
to the Health Department from the RandwicK
Military Hospital the following day, was con-
sidered to have been the first case ol pneu-
monic influenza that year. (2) The epidemic
occurred in two waves, each oi about 10 wccks
duration; the peak of the first wave was be-
tween April 12 and 19, when admissions to the
metropolitan emergency hospitals averaged 15U
a day over a period of two or three weeks.
The peak of the second wave was about June
22; hospital admissions averaged 180 a day
over a period of three weeks. Deaths during
the first wave (March 19 to May 27) numbcied
1892, and 3989 deaths occurred during the
second wave, from May 28 to August 25. (3)
The cases began to decline early in July, me
last recorded case was on September 30.
What is medical diathermy? —2449.
A treatment by means of which electricity
is passed through the body tissues with no
other effect than heat production. The advan-
tage over hot compresses and the like is that
heat produced by the latter is to a great ex-
tent wasted by bad conduction of the skin,
whereas electrical energy penetrates the body
and radiates heat in the desired intensity and
direction. Diathermic current differs from ordi-
nary high-frequency current in that the voltage
is less and amperage greater; the patient feels
little more than the increased temperature. In
surgical diathermy the current may be intensi-
fied to bring about tissue destruction.
What is a true blood serum, and what is
an artificial serum ? —2534.
True blood serum is the fluid portion of
blood or plasma from which the fibrin or dot-
ting principle has been removed. It is a
complicated solution of many substances; some
are known and can be identified, while others
can only be recognised by results that they
produce. An artificial serum provides tem-
porary nourishment to the body tissues, its
constituents being common salt 0.9 p.c., potas-
sium chloride 0.04 p.c., calcium chloride 0.02
p.c., sugar (dextrose) 0.1 p.c.
My tomcat, three years old, has recently
developed an excessive amount of saliva, which
flows copiously from his jaw. Cause and treat-
ment ? —2487.
Condition can only be diagnosed by ex-
amination. Maybe some foreign body at the
back of the throat, or a tumor. In the latter
case a large blob-like swelling appears at the
undersurface of the tongue, and a surgical
operation is necessary.
Can you tell me anything about the New
Guinea rivers (1) Sepik, (2) Ramu, (3) Mark-
ham, and (4) Waria, especially as regards navi-
gability ? —2586.
(1) The Sepik is approximately 600 miles
long, and at the entrance is about 1 mile in
width, and for over 200 miles is nowhere
less than -J-mile wide. A vessel drawing 13ft.
can at average times proceed up the river for
250 miles, and in flood times considerably
farther, but navigation is somewhat difficult
as the water is very dirty and mudbanks
abound. It is necessary always to hug the
higher banks and timber and keep in the track
indicated by driftwood, grass, etc. The depth
varies from three to 12 fathoms, and at average
times the channel is rarely less than four to five
athoms deep for the first 240 miles. (2) The
Ramu is next largest and, like the Sepik,
meanders through a large swamp plain for a
great distance. It flows into Broken Water
Bay about 15 miles to the south of the Sepik,
and its length is approximately 360 miles. The
river is navigable by small flat-bottomed craft
for a considerable distance. Jt is fast-flowing
and difficult to navigate, and the depth under-
goes considerable and rapid changes. (3) The
Markham is third in size, rises near the source
of the Ramu, and flows generally south-easterly
into the Huon Gulf. The river is shallow and,
owing to its rapid current, can be navigated
only by small boats and with difficulty. (4) The
Waria flows into the north of Hercules Bay,
near the Papuan border, and is not navigable.
Recipe for preserving and bottling unfer-
mented orange and lemon juice ? —2568.
Fruit should be ripe, sound and fresh. Cut
across and squeeze into a strainer over a sauce-
pan. Bring to the boil, and keep steaming just
under boiling-point for 15 minutes. Bottles and
corks should have been placed in an oven,
and allowed to become very hot. Fill the hot
bottles with the hot juice, add a layer of melted
paraffin wax or dip corks in hot wax, and seal.
Store in a cool place.
Recipe for making jelly soft soap, to be used
for scrubbing parquet floors ? —2555.
Place the contents of one or more large
packets of Lux in a tin or basin, add sufficient
hot water to cover well, and to each packet of
flakes allow 1 dessertspoon cloudy ammonia.
Stir well, and let it set, when it will be ready
to use safely on the best parquet. If wanted
softer, heat the soap and add more hot water,
then set again.
(1) How to tin a soldering iron ? (2) Useful
hints on soldering ? —2508.
(1) Clean the point of the iron with file
or emery cloth, heat it, dip it into fluxite, at
the same time holding a bar of solder on the
iron and thus coating its surface with the
solder. (2) Clean and tin the parts to be
soldered before uniting them; keep the iron
hot and well tinned; do not use too much flux
or solder.

When and where did the first official air-
mail service take place, and particulars of the
stamps ? —2484.
Outside pigeon services, the Paris Balloon
Post, which commenced on Sept. 23, 1871. (2)
Contemporary stamps were used, chiefly the
20, 30, 40 centimes, laureated head, and the
20 and 40 centimes, Ceres type.

Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain ail property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which

“Centurion”: Here is a little puzzle
for sleuths to ferret out. Board of Trade
returns show that British armament
makers and builders of ’planes of all
naval and military types exported more
of their products in the first six months
of this year than in the previous
two years. Ammunition, arms, tor-
pedoes, submarine mines, other ordnance
stores, war vessels and aeroplanes to the
value of £2,482,246 went out of Britain
in the period stated. Where did it all
go? Supplies to South American coun-
tries, Arabia and the Far East have been
infinitesimal. For instance, Japan has
only* taken 900 rounds of rifle ammuni-
tion (?) and four anti-aircraft gun mount-
ings. The recorded issue for other coun-
tries, literally from China to Peru, is
equally farcical. The Board of Trade
says it is not in a position to say where
the stuff went, and the Customs also
lies doggo on the subject. Yet, not a
cartridge is supposed to leave Britain
without special license from the Govern-
ment.

“Hunter Grubbe”: There are name-
words —trade-terms mostly—that have
slipped into the language as quickly and
unobtrusively as “bowser” (B. 18/7/’34).
Rose Macaulay has written of “the
happy spring when we are full of that
kruschen feeling.” Saintsbury told of
“Guinness-colored foam.” Everyone
understands what it is “to pelmanise” or
to read “a bovrilised version of the
news.” But of all surnames that have
been found to meet a need “boycott” has
gone furthest. “Boycotter” and “boy-
cottage” are good French; “boycot-
tieren” is good German ; the Dutch have
“boycotten” and in Russian they have it
“boycottirovat” and “boycottirovanie.”
And all through Captain Boycott, of
Lough Mask House, Co. Mayo, whose
shindy with the Irish Land League in
1880 brought the word into use.

Dale Collins told the Fellowship of
Australian Writers at Sydney about a
dinner Heinemann, the publisher, gave—
to about 90 well-known writers —to cele-
brate the union of his firm with the
.American Doran. No one knew any-
body else. Dale’s neighbor at dinner was
a very well-known woman writer. He
couldn’t think what to say to her. Then
he remembered that the cottage he had
rented was furnished with her books.
The lady was delighted, took the name
of the old lady owner and said she
would send a copy of her new work.
Going home Dale remembered it was
another woman writer whose books he
had seen. Next, for something to say,
he mentioned tripe. Ethel Mannin leaned
over and said “Tripe and onions—l adore
it.” It proved a popular subject, and
after that the company talked tripe ex-
clusively.

“Divot Digger”: Doping golf balls
with a hypodermic syringe just as if they
were racehorses is the latest. Long
flight in the modern ball is due to wind-
ing rubber at high tension round a core
which contains liquid. In hardening the
cover subsequently by heat, some of the
resiliency of the winding is lost. The
internal pressure is now restored by
injecting additional liquid after the hard-
ening process, with the result that from
20 to 30 yards is added to the pill’s
flight.

“Goofa”: Snail-racing, referred to in
a recent Bulletin, isn’t as exciting as the
tortoise sprints conducted at Oklahoma
City (U.S.A.), where punters are kept in
thrilling suspense as first one and then
another of the competitors pauses for a
rest with the race apparently won. The
course is 25 yards long, and the entrants
have their numbers chalked on their
backs. A recent cup race was won by
a rank outsider, Pebblestone, the small-
est tortoise entered, whose speed, a frac-
tion over seven-hundredths of a mile per
hour, brought its owner a prize of 3500
dahlars.

“Trek”: Reading of the plague of
migrating native rats now infesting
north-west Queensland and the eastern
N T., one is reminded of the extraordin-
ary periodical migrations westward of
the lemming, a small rodent found
throughout sub-Arctic Europe and
Siberia. Every now and then, for no
reason that science has yet been able to
discover, these creatures move westward
in vast hordes, eating everything before
them, though, since they are vegetarians,
they are not such all-round afflictions as
the'N.Q. rats seem to be. Reaching the
sea coast, and particularly in northern
Norway, where tremendous cliffs drop to
the sea, the lemming army pours over, a
living cataract, and comes to the end of
its journey.

GLORIA TRIUMPH PUT THROUGH ITS
PACES OVER “BULLETIN” TEST COURSE.
SPORTS-CAR PERFORMANCE WITH TOURING-CAR COMFORT.
BY FRED BERRY.
Until recently sports and touring types of cars were, from
the standpoint of service, as wide apart as the poles, and
attempts to merge both features met with little success.
Adherents of each group insisted upon top-gear perform-
ance and riding comfort at low speeds in the case of tourers,
and high road speed coupled with comfort and safety around
60 and 70 m.p.h. when driving the sports types.
Had the prophecy been made, even five years ago, that this
apparently impossible compromise would be effected by a car
similar to the Gloria Triumph, it would have been received with
scant respect.
Yet the fact remains that when tested
over The Bulletin course recently this
car, with an engine smaller than many
motor-cycles, put up a performance that,
with minor qualifications, complied with
the most exacting requirements of both
sports and touring drivers.
Certainly the JOB7-c.c. motor could
not be expected to pull a sturdy chassis
and closed body up steep grades on top
gear, but gear shifting, made by a touch
of the fingers, together with silent gears
throughout, allowed the driver to main-

tain an extraordinarily high average road
speed. Furthermore, suspension and rid-
ing comfort were of the true touring
standard at low speeds, with the addition
of sports-type safety in cornering and on
rough going at high speed.
The car tested, lent by Buckle and
Harden, Ltd., N.S.W. distributors, was
driven by W. R. Farr, and together with
driver and observer weighed 26|Cwt.
Speedometer reading stood at 2684 miles,
but, in spite of having been carefully run
in for this distance, the motor was still
slightly stiff and not yet up to its peak
performance, a sure indication of a long
and useful life.
Passing through the busy city streets,
as would be expected, traffic-dodging
was a simple matter, and rapid gear-
changing, indicated only by change in

form-type chassis and neat construction of motor.
the exhaust note, resulted in a very rapid
yet safe trip to Parramatta.
On the open road through Baulkham
Hills the speedometer needle jumped to
the 50 mark, which appears to be the
most economical touring gait for this
car.
Entering the coasting section at 15
m.p.h. with gear-lever in neutral, 688
yards was covered before coming to
rest, proving freedom of braking equip-
ment, also of wheel bearings and trans-
mission details.
Maximum speed was then tested over
a measured mile, the distance being
clocked in 57 2-ssec., giving 62.7 m.p.h.
Leaving North Richmond the “back-
country” route through Grose Vale was
taken to Kurrajong, and here, over un-
made roads, cut up badly after recent
rains, the Triumph behaved well, corner-
ing safely at speed on the many tricky
bends.
From a standing start the last two
miles of Kurrajong Mountain were
climbed against the watch, and during
the ascent the driver used his gears to
advantage, while cornering on hairpin
bends was fast, neat and very safe. Time
occupied on the climb was 4min. 25sec.
Slight wheelslip was observed on the
final rough section, but generally this was
an astonishing performance for a 9-h.p.
engine pulling 26|cwt.
. Coming down the mountain the emer-
gency hand-brake equipment, actuating
on an independent pair of shoes on the
rear wheels, was tested with satisfactory
results.
Arriving at Richmond, the cross-
country route via Castlereagh to Penrith
was taken, and on this section several
critical tests were conducted.
That of covering 350 yards as slowly
as possible in top gear, followed imme-
diately by a similar distance accelerated
on full throttle with gear-lever still in
top, proved rather exacting on the tiny
power unit—in normal practice the
driver would use one or other of the
intermediate silent gears with better
effect. The slow section occupied 2min.,
an average of 5
m.p.h., while 25sec.
for the accelerated
section, crossing the
finishing-line at 45
m.p.h., gave an aver-
age speed of 28.8
m.p.h. From 0 to 50
m.p.h. through all
gears took 22sec., the
Triumph showing a
very snappy getaway
on lower-gear ratios.
Next test, that of
timing acceleration
from a steady 10
m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h.
in top, third and
second gears, showed
that, in silent third,
performance was
almost equal to
figures of the larger
touring cars when driven in top. Results
obtained were: Top, 17 l-ssec. ; third,
10 2-ssec. ; second, 7sec.
At a speed of 25 m.p.h. the efficiency
of the hydraulic braking equipment was
tested. The car came to rest in 21 feet
without swerving—a good result.
Left and right turning circles were then
measured, the high-geared steering allow-
ing very rapid change from one full lock
to the other. Left lock circle measured
38ft. and right 44ft.
On return to headquarters the total
distance covered was found to be 118.5
miles, and running time, inclusive of all
tests, 3hr. 2min., giving an average road
speed of 39 m.p.h.—the highest recorded
in this series of tests, irrespective of type
or power of car, and an extraordinary
performance for a car under 10 h.p.
Fuel required to replenish the tank
was 4gal. 10oz., giving a petrol consump-
tion of 29 m.p.g.—excellent in view of

the high average speed, and no coasting
or free-wheeling. Due to the acute angle
of the filler-pipe, the odor of petrol was
noticeable when cornering fast for the first
half of the journey, and an unknown quan-
tity was lost. The average consumption
must therefore have
been better than 30.

type fc?r exhaust. This arrangement, it
is claimed, gives increased power output

Cylinder is cast in special wear-
resisting chromedium ’ alloy, with
pistons of light aluminium alloy. Crank-
shaft, balanced statically and dynami-
cally, runs in three large bronze-backed
main bearings. Full-pressure lubrication
system is used, oil being drawn from the
sump by a skew-drive gear-type oil pump
and passed through an efficient filter
before reaching bearings or timing gear.
A further interesting feature, from the
owner-driver’s viewpoint, is that provi-
sion is made for easy removal of sump,
timing, tappet and overhead-valve covers
when overhaul is necessary.
Fuel is drawn from a lOgal. tank at
rear of chassis by means of an electri-
cally-operated pump and fed to the latest
type down-draught Solex carburettor,
equipped with independent self-start-
ing device. This unit is actually an
additional carburettor in miniature,
supplying the correct mixture for cold
or hot starting and slow running before
the major unit comes into operation.
Controllable hot-spot is cast integral with
the inlet manifold.
Ignition is of coil and battery type,
all high-tension leads being waterproof.
Startex automatic starting system is in-
corporated with the motor, cutting in
immediately if it stalls. An alternative
manual starting switch can be used by
turning the ignition key in the opposite
direction.
Cooling system includes impellor and
fan, while vertical shutters outside the
sloping radiator are used for tempera-
ture control.

the rear end of the gearbox. Conse-
quently after moving away in first gear
all subsequent changes can be made
without depressing the clutch pedal.
Central gear-lever is short and sturdy,
of the remote-control type, while thfi
hand-brake lever, actuating on independ-*
ent shoes, is located almost horizontally
between the front bucket-type seats.
A tubular propeller-shaft runs to the
banjo-type rear axle in almost direct line,
and is fitted with metal universal joints.
Final drive is by helical bevel gearing,
with taper roller bearings in differential
and hubs. Final reduction of 5.22 to 1
gives 3966 revs, at 60 m.p.h.
Chassis is of the upswept, underslung
type, with cruciform frame members and
independent body supports and brackets.
Conventional semi-elliptic springs are
fitted front and rear, wheelbase being
108 in. and track 48in. Hydraulic shock-
absorbers are fitted as auxiliaries to all
four springs.
Lockheed hydraulic braking equip-
ment is used on all four wheels, drums
being 12in. diameter with adjustable
steel brake-shoes.
Steering is high-geared type, on worm-
and-nut principle, with adjustment for
end play. The steering-wheel, of large
diameter, has spokes built up of spring
steel in order to absorb road shocks.
A novel feature, so far as Australian
motorists are concerned, is the central
jacking system, whereby jacks, fore and
aft, are built integral with the frame and
brought into action by a quick-thread
screw on a swivel-jointed jack-handle.
Bodywork is good and upholstery
genuine leather. Internal fittings and
dashboard equipment are attractive, and
the body profile of the standard sedan
is neat and sporty.
The car’s centre of gravity is low.
The average adult can comfortably look
over the roof of the Gloria sedan, yet
ample leg and head room is provided for
the full complement of passengers.
These Cold Mornings.
Hints for Easy Starting.
During summer the motorist is freed
from starting troubles, as the engine is
invariably at a temperature sufficiently
high to vaporise the fuel, but in cold
weather difficulties are encountered
unless certain precautions are observed.
If the starting handle is to be kept
snugly tucked away in the tool kit every
effort should be made to keep the battery
in a fully-charged condition, for a flat
battery will not turn the cold motor fast
enough to fire the charge in the cylinders.
Even with an efficient battery, drivers
will find it a good policy to give careful
attention to operating the choke control
and switch key.
When making the early-morning start
in winter the choke must be pulled out
and the starter pedal depressed so that
the motor is turned several times before
the ignition is switched on. As soon as
the cylinders begin to fire, the choke
control is slowly returned to the “in”
position, and not until even and regular
firing is obtained should the driver
attempt to start away.
Another dodge worthy of experiment
is to throw out the clutch at the first
start. By doing this the drain on the
battery is considerably lightened, because
the effort to churn the oil in gearbox is
avoided.
Drivers who carefully carry out these
instructions will be pleasantly surprised
with the ease of starting, and will be
further rewarded by considerably re-
duced running costs.
Average Speeds.
No doubt the least truthful instrument
on the car dashboard is the speedometer.
Not a few drivers rival it when boasting
of average speed on long journeys.
Of course automobiles of this year’s
vintage are capable, in the hands of skil-

Lancia Wins the Mussolini Gold Cup.
The stipulation that only stock cars
might compete for the Mussolini Gold
Cup was the cause of much heartburn-
ing, for leading sports-car manufac-
turers could not fulfil the requirement
of proving 100 sales.
The result of this strenuous 1250-mile
race with its £B5OO in prize-money was a
victory for the Lancia, which filled first
and second places.
Cars started numbered 201, including
a lone British Singer (24th place), and
one of the results has been to give an
immense impetus of favor of independent
front-wheel suspension.
Australian motorists are all familiar
with the Lancia and its excellent riding
qualities.
The Perth-Adelaide record is held by
Miss Jean Robertson, who, at the wheel
of a Lancia, covered the 1750 miles of
difficult going in 58 hours.
Motor Oddities.
“Synchro”: Owner and driver of
Queensland’s first car was James Track-
son, of Brisbane, who in the early ’nine-
ties imported a steam car, a Locomobile,
from Scotland. It caused a commotion
among saddlers, smiths and coachbuilders
when it first appeared on the streets, and
they petitioned the Home Secretary
(Col. Foxton) to enact that a man should
be compelled to walk in front of the
vehicle with a red flag. Foxton declined
the request. The Locomobile (no con-
nection with the U.S.A. car of the same
name) had a twin-cylinder steam-engine
with a kerosene-burner, and its maxi-
mum speed was 25 m.p.h. Long trips
were impossible, as the boilers had to be
refilled every 25 miles. Trackson visited
Townsville and other places, but he never
ventured in the streets without a spare
passenger to quieten horses. Once Col.
Foxton accompanied Trackson to a mili-
tary pageant at Lytton, but on arrival the
car caused a stampede amongst the
horses, and the pageant had to be aban-
doned. Later Trackson bought a twin-

“Ready Always”: Members of the
Queensland Ambulance Transport Bri-

contrivances to extricate bogged cars.
The Atherton (N.Q.) ambulance cars are
equipped with two sets of chains on the
back wheels, tread and “strap-on,” plus
a set of light chains on the front wheels.
These, in addition to “flappers,” tackle
and digging tools, are all needed. Often
a car returns with its wheels solid discs
of mud. My own experience is that, apart
from a tractor or team, the only certain
method of getting out when bogged is to
use a bed-log as fulcrum, and a stout sap-
ling as lever under the wheel hub, pro-
viding enough lift to enable timber to be
packed under the wheels. Of course, this
applies to timbered country. On the
plains a Short’s jack or winch tackle is
the only solution.

SUPERHETERODYNE SHORT-WAVE
CONVERTERS
BY DON B. KMOCK
The Bulletin has received many requests for further constructional
information on the types of short-wave converters recently designed by
Mr. Knock. This article deals briefly with these units, each of which may
be used with any broadcast receiver having sufficient sensitivity when tuned
to the higher wave-length portion of the broadcast band.
These converters provide a ready means of obtaining good short-wave
reception, and effectively convert the broadcast receiver to a short-wave
superheterodyne combination.
There are three fundamental methods
of obtaining satisfactory reception of
short-wave broadcasting stations. The
first is by the use of a receiver designed
solely for short-wave reception, self-
contained with battery or “all-electric”
power; the second, by the use of a
special receiver of the all-wave type,
wherein all wave-lengths, including the
short-wave bands and normal broadcast,
are included in the tuning range;
the third method is by the use of some
form of attachment to an existing broad-
cast receiver, whereby that broadcast
receiver may be used to reproduce short-
wave signals, with the tuning, pro tern.,
done by the attachment.
Under this heading of “attachment”
come the plain adaptor, the more
elaborate adaptor, with its associated
power pack, and the frequency-changer
or superhet converter. The adaptor is
most unsatisfactory in unskilled hands,
for it is merely a regenerative detector
utilising the audio channel of the broad-
cast receiver by a plug-in connector. The
glorified adaptor carrying its own power
unit is still uncommercial, even if it has
a stage of T.R.F. incorporated, for it
suffers from all the fussiness in hand-
ling which, in unskilled hands, means
disappointment, and a wrong impression
of the possibilities of short-wave enter-
tainment. The superhet converter, on
Fig. 1. Circuit diagram of the plug-in coil type superhetero-
dyne short-wave converter. The coupling between the modu-
lator ( detector ) and oscillator is obtained by connecting the
suppressor-grid of the 57 valve to the tuned circuit in the
grid of the 56 (or 27) oscillator.
the other hand, particularly if inclusive
of a stage of intermediate R.F. amplifica-
tion, calls for no more special tuition
than connecting up, switching on and
operating the tuning control exactly as
in a modern broadcast receiver.

The superhet converter is by far the
most desirable of these attachments,
enabling the conver-
sion or adapting of
the broadcast receiver
to respond to short-
wave signals; but,
unless it is properly
designed and effect-
ively coupled to the
receiver, it can be dis- •
appointing by reason
of excessive noise
level in the form of
valve hiss. By ils
action it makes use of
all the valves in the
receiver, the R.F.
stages of the receiver
becoming the inter-
mediate - frequency
amplifier. In the case
of a superhet broad-
cast receiver, fre-
quency changing takes
place twice, yet no
excessive noise is
noticeable with the
types of converters
which are to be de-
scribed, prov id e d
everything in both re-
ceiver and converter
is as it should be.
After a year or
two of experimental
work with all kinds
of converters, the
writer found, with
the arrival of the
R.F. pentode valves
with free suppressor-
grid, that this free
grid provided a most
effective coup ling
between the modu-
lator (detector) and
oscillator, being con-
stant at all frequen-
cies. An example of
the application of
the suppressor-grid
in this way is sup-
pressor-grid modula-
tion in transmission,
closely akin to the
modulation of an oscillator in the short-
wave converter. After making several
models with separately-tuned modulator
and oscillator circuits, ganged tuning was
used, and, by careful attention to layout
of the tuned circuits and the coil details,
operation was nar-
rowed down to one
tuning control and
a seldom - touched
manual adjustment.
Plug-in Coil
Converter.
The first of these
converters is the
plug-in coil type, and
readers interested in
making any of these
types, including the
switched models,
should follow the
circuit details of this
first one carefully,
for the application
in the others is fun-
damentally the same,
beyond the introduc-
F lion of wave-change by switching.
The circuit diagram is Fig. 1. At
this stage it is as well to mention
that, although these converters could
have been designed to utilise the broad-
cast receiver voltages, it is much more
satisfactory to use a separate power pack,
and thus avoid upsetting voltage distri-
bution in the receiver. The modulator is
a 57, the oscillator a 56 or 27, the inter-
mediate stage a 58 and the rectifier
a type 80. Plug-in coils specially made
for this converter, also the I.F. trans-
former for 585 kc., may be obtained from
R.C.S., Radio, Sydney. The oscillator is
a modified form of the well-known Hart-
ley, and has the advantage that a single
tapped coil is used instead of a grid and
separate feedback coil. This also cuts
out the switching of a plate coil in the
switched converters. The reason for
the use of an I.F. at 585 kc. is that
this falls between 7ZL and 3AR on the
broadcast dial, and this position is
reasonably clear from interference which
would be superimposed upon the high-
frequency signal from the converter
mixer in the form of a continuous
Fig. 3. Circuit diagram used in the switched converters. The capacity coupling to the aerial is
dispensed with, and switch section SW1 controls the aerial coupling coils for each range, in step

broadcast receiver.
whistle. To use these converters, the
broadcast receiver therefore must be
tuned to 585 kc. The receiver volume
control is used to control the level just
as it would be used normally.
Fig. 2 shows exactly how the converter
is designed, with the plug-in coils
mounted above the metal top of the
chassis: The key to the parts in the
diagram of Fig. 1 is as follows:

The reason for the use of a four-pin
socket for the detector coil and a five-
pin for the oscillator is to avoid plug-
ging the wrong coil into the sockets, as
might easily occur if two four-pin
sockets were used. No damage would
result, however ; merely silence by non-
functioning of the oscillator.
There are three pairs of coils to cover
the entire range, with overlapping be-
tween 14 and 100 metres. All short-
wave broadcasting takes place in
channels within this wide frequency. For
those who wish to make their own coils,
the details correspond to the specifica-
tions of the “Wide-World Four” coils
(B. 18/7/ ’34), minus the broadcast
range ; and, instead of a separate cathode
coil for the oscillator, the tapping is
made at a third of the winding from the
“bottom” end of the grid coil.
Fig. 1 shows clearly how the converter
is connected to the receiver, the only
disadvantage being that the spring clip

how the coils are grouped round the Lekmek wave-change switch.

and the aerial must be changed over by
hand when going from short wave to
broadcast, and vice versa.
Switch-type Converters.
With the almost universal adoption of
wave-change switching in preference to
plug-in coils, there are many readers
who will prefer this innovation, and
rightly so. Although the results obtained
are exactly the same, the use of switch-
ing makes the converter even more

desirable commercially. Changing coils
by hand necessitates access to the top
of the chassis, although it would be quite
easy to remodel the converter to provide
for coils plugging from the front. It is
much more convenient to handle a
switch which does just the same thing,
but due care must be taken in the design
to group all coils in the most suitable
permanent position to keep wiring as
short and direct as possible.
Fig. 3 is the diagram of the circuit tried
for two converters, one being the
same size as the plug-in model dealt
with, and the other one of midget dimen-
sions. The latter is illustrated in Fig. 4.
Reference to the circuit diagram shows
that voltage distribution is taken through
a 15,000- or 20,000-ohm voltage-divider,
and that a four-section, four-point wave-
change switch is employed. The choice
of the switch is a matter of vital im-
portance, and Fig. 8 shows the kind the
writer uses as a certain remedy for switch
faults. The model illustrated is a three-
section one made by Lekmek Radio
Laboratories, Sydney. This switch is
a solid engineering job mechanically, and
is electrically sound. It does what it is
intended to do, makes contact unfail-
ingly, and its design is such that circuits
in which inter-coupling must be avoided
may be well separated and even screened
from each other. An important point to
watch in mounting this switch under
the chassis is that the metal boss from
which the shaft extends is clear of sur-
rounding metal, otherwise the switch-
arm nearest the front end of the switch
would be shorted to earth.
Fig. 5 shows the underneath of a
converter wired to the diagram of Fig.
3. The section of the switch toward
the rear of the chassis (marked SWI in
Fig. 3) throws in the aerial-coupling coil
for each range on points Al, A 2 and A 3.
Point No. 4 puts the aerial straight
through the converter to the broadcast
receiver. Section SW2 switches the de-
tector-grid coils, SW3 the oscillator-grid
coils, and SW4 the oscillator cathode
taps. Values in the diagram are the
same as for the plug-in converter. Fig.
6 shows how the coils may be mounted
underneath the chassis and arranged in
proximity to the switch ; also the point-
to-point wiring is clearly indicated. The
coils are wound on two li-inch formers,
as shown, and the winding details are as
follows: —•

Oscillator, OL1: 4 turns 26 D.S.C. tapped at

and oscillator coils in this converter, the coils

afterward twisting

The illustrations show the plain type
of vernier dial in vogue at the time these
original converters were made, and with
one made to the design of Fig. 4, and
having the latest Efco altimeter-type dial,
a very neat and effective model will be
the result. The chassis dimensions for
the converter of Fig. 4 are 8| x 8? x 3
inches.
Owing to the popularity of short-wave
converters as a means of making
good extra use of a good broad-
cast receiver, the commercial
product has made its appearance.
The Lekmek converter assembly
illustrated in Fig. 7 is particularly
noteworthy. This assembly in-
cludes the complete wave-change
and coil system, tuning con-
densers and intermediate-fre-
quency transformer. Thus the
most vital part is all ready for
mounting on a chassis, with
valve sockets and other compon-
ents, and with the accompanying
instructions the constructor has
three-quarters of the job done for
, him.
The writer does not claim that
the superhet converter is any
more efficient than a good
modern all-wave receiver, for if
the converter is used with an un-
suitable receiver the results will
be unsatisfactory and disappoint-
ing. But many people are un-
willing to scrap perfectly good broadcast
receivers to purchase all-wave models,
and for such people the converter pro-
vides an equally effective and less expen-
sive method of all-wave reception.
Of course, by ignoring the power unit
and using types 77, 78 and 37 valves with
battery supply, duplicates of the con-
verters described can be made for use
with battery broadcast receivers.

Country Short-wave Explorations,
At night, other than RVIS, on 70m.,
there has been little of interest. The 80m.
amateur band has been good, but has
been playing queer tricks at times with
“skip.”
The transmission from 3ME at the
bottom of this band has been heard once
since last week’s notes. During the periods
when 25m. could be tried in the daytime
signal strength seemed to be much the
same, with FYA still well in the lead.
Between 6.30 and 7 a.m. the 49m.
band has been much weaker, both the
best stations, DJC and RFN, being
only fair copy, with several others too
weak to identify.
On a recent Sunday there was quite
a feast. On the 31m. band GSB and
DJA were quite good after 7.30 a.m., with
strength slowly rising, and between these
were two foreigners, unidentified, both
being weaker than GSB. One of these
appeared to be on OXY’s frequency,
31.5 m., and closed at 8.30 without any
English announcement. Both stations
were playing some familiar and some
unfamiliar music. The language on the
weaker station sounded at times like
Spanish, but the station was not on the
usual wave-length of EAQ (30.3 m.).
At 8.20, HBL, the League of Nations’
station, came on, and there was a talk
by Prof. Copland from New York.
This was then translated into French.
The quality, as is always the case with
HBL, was excellent, and strength was
good. This station was also on 38.4 m.,
but transmission was very weak. Those
who are interested in world affairs will
find HBL well worth catching round
about 8.30 a.m. on Sundays.
At 12.30, W2XAF, 31.4 m., was com-
ing through at quite the best strength
heard for some time. On the 25m.
band DJD was giving the English news
services, which consisted mostly of a
defence of the Hitler regime. This
could be copied 100 p.c. at 12.15 oh
the speaker. FYA was even better, and
RNE was considerably weaker, but
quite easily copied. At 2 p.m., WBXK

and the broadcast band. He was easily
copied, but barely speaker strength
until 2.30, after which, until closing at
3, reception was perfect. At 2.30, when
the 8.8. C. stations start up, GSB was
easily the best. GSD, 25.5 m., could
only be described as fair, while GSB,
31.54, was quite good speaker strength.
They both weakened considerably by
4 p.m. The 20m. amateur band was

coming in much earlier than previously,
and Ninth District stations were good
by 12 p.m., an hour earlier than a fort-
night ago.

amplifier, writer has found the 2A3’s run
hot with auto-bias, with results not to
be compared with 59’s or 46’s in Class
B. Testing the 2A3’s showed them to
be in perfect order. Using fixed bias,
another five watts output is obtained
with a reduction of harmonic distortion.
The positive of the electrolytic con-
densers goes to earth, as the entire output
of this bias supply is below earth
potential.

What’s What in Radio.
That newspaper reference to an aston-
ished individual who overheard broad-
casting over P.M.G. auto circuits brings
no “Well, I’m damned!” from old-timers.
In Brisbane I have, whilst waiting for

(Jap), at r 7 on No. 4 carrier to Cairns.
Sportsmen three floors below 4QG (12
amps, in aerial) get winners off a
couple of W.E. interphone circuits.
A resonant wiring loop is all that is
required, and, the ’phones being always
in series with the line, hysteresis
does the rest, with the modulation super-
imposed as it is on carriers at audio
frequency. Inducted programmes can
be heard over the Bris.-Rockhampton
carrier on 4RK’s lines, and the operators
at 4QG and 4RK converse on sounder
over the broadcast lines.—V.E.

Short-wave listeners are complaining

in keeping with the 8.8. C. s suggestion
that listeners throughout the Empire

ciated by listeners sending in reports for

The latest innovation of Station 2UW
Sydney, the Wandaphone, is a corn-
plete success. Providing a link between
announcer and studio for outside broad-
casts, it enables the
announcer to move
about freely whilst
talking. 2UW’s first
venture, in mobile
broadcasting was on
the day of the open-
ing of the Sydney
Harbor Bridge,
March, 1932, when
Don B. Knock and
F. E. Buckell car-
ried the “wandering
mike,” a portable
short-wave radio-
telephone, borne in
army packs on the
shoulders.
The Radio Society of Great Britain,
transmitter section, is organising a 12
months’ period of 10-metre transmission
for amateurs. This band is a bone of
contention to amateurs in Australia and
England, for no amateur signals between
Oceania and Europe have yet been veri-
fied on it. Twelve months of it should
bring results and it should provide a
thrill for the first VK to work a G on ten.

“Popular Wireless” (England) states
that the first television theatre in the
world is to be built at a Lancashire sea-
side resort by a Manchester inventor.
Seating will be for 2000. Programmes
will be topical, with entertainment to
follow. The source of transmission will'
be a station in the Irish Free State to
evade the ban on commercial broad-
casting in England. Evidently the pro-
ject is to use the huge Blackpool Tower
as the reception point for ultra-short-
wave television across the Irish Channel.

“V.E.”: Two amateur stations were
on the 250-metres region whilst Brisbane
enjoyed its Sunday siesta beside its loud-
speakers. There was a hurried whis-
pered consultation between the operator
and the new announcer of one of them.
The announcer, “mike shy,” baulked at
the Italian title of the solo “Your Tiny
Hand is Frozen.” The operator shared
his joke with Brisbane. Over the air
came: “This is Station VK4 . Now
will follow a tenor solo The Frozen
Mitt.’ ”

TRADE JOTTINGS.
Trouble has been experienced in the
design of battery all-wave receivers using
the type IA6 valve. This “pentagrid
converter” has characteristics which
render it unsatisfactory in a measure for
high-frequency work as combined oscil-
lator-detector, it being necessary to shunt
the oscillator by a separate triode. Free
from such trouble is the new IC6, which
facilitates operation over the higher fre-
quen c i e s. In
comparison with
the IA6, the
IC6 has higher
mutual conduct-
ance and fila-
ment emission.
C h a racteristics
of the IC6 for

vertion are ad-
joined (details

Apropos “V.E.” (B. 25/7/’34) and
harmonics of Sydney broadcasters being
strong in Brisbane. VIB coastal radio
has a powerful 3500 kc. harmonic in

The Latest Radiola.
The console type of cabinet design has
by no means reached finality, as may
be seen from the illustration of the latest
Radiola. This is the all-wave model 240,
comprising a most advanced type of
superheterodyne. The beautifully-finished
cabinet is designed with a sloping panel.
As the chassis is thus placed at, an angle,
examination from the rear is facilitated
and the removal of valves, etc., made
easy. The dial is a Rotovisor, with the
broadcast band calibrated in wave-lengths
and frequencies, and the short-wave
bands in wave-length. The position of
the dial permits tuning without stooping.
The valve line-up in the Radiola 240 is:
6D6 s.-w. R.F. amplifier, 6D6 R.F am-
plifier, 6A7 det.-oscillator, 6D6 I.F. am-
plifier, 687 det.-A.V.C., ’42 output pen-
tode and ’BO rectifier.
The Q. and A. Column.
Have decided to build the “Daventry Short-
wave Four” (“A.R.N.” 29/12/’33), but need
some information on the 40-mmfd. condenser
in the screen-grid circuit of the ’36 valve. 1
cannot procure this. What can be used in its
place 3—67. . .
Small fixed condensers can be obtained m
Sydney from Wetless Electric Mfg. Co., King-
street, St. Peters. Alternatively, you can use
a superhet intermediate compression-type con-
denser or even an 11-plate midget variable.
If a variable condenser is used, do not employ
it as a regeneration control.
Please publish the circuit and layout of the
“Wide-World Two” receiver as used by C. J.
Czisz, Macksville, N.S.W. —70.
Yours is one of many requests. A complete
constructional article will be published in a
week or two.
I wish to buy a receiver, but would like to
know where to go for instructions on how to
use it. —68.
Your radio dealer will explain all that is
necessary. The modern receiver is so easy
to use that you need know nothing about it
beyond which knobs to turn.
(1) Can foreign stations, such as London
or Paris, be received direct on an ordinary radio
receiver (not an all-waver ) 3 (2) Is a short-
wave or all-wave set necessary to hear thqse
stations, or do foreign stations work on me
same wave-lengths as Australian broadcasting
stations 3 (3) Is there any device to convert
an ordinary set to an (ill-wave receiver 3—69.
(1) Yes. Under extremely good conditions,
given a very sensitive receiver and good loca-
tion, but such reception is freakish and not a
regular occurrence. (2) A short-wave tuner
is necesssary to hear the European short-wave
stations unless they are relayed by a local
broadcasting station. Stations in almost every
country in the world broadcast on waves be-
tween 200 and 600 metres. (3) Yes, short-
wave converters may be used with an average
modern broadcast receiver with excellent re-
sults. See article.
What valves can I use in a Telefunken 3-
valve receiver, as I cannot obtain PM3 and
PM 254 types in Melbourne. Would it be pos-
sible to fit new sockets in the set and to use
other valves 3—71.
You should be able to obtain these valves
from Scott and Holladay, or Alan S. Duke,
of Melbourne. Apparently your valves had
English type bases. Have the sockets changed
and use the same types in American bases
if English bases are unobtainable. You could
buy Marquis adaptors as an alternative.
Am undecided about buying one of two
receivers —a 6-valve Radiola and a Golden
Voice 5-valve. I have had both on test, and
definitely prefer one make, but would like to
know what would be the battery drain on one
compared with the other. —72.
In the absence of technical details of these
receivers, no opinion can be expressed as to
which would be the most economical.
My rotary converter worked from my house-
lighting 32-volt plant interferes with my short-
wave reception. What do you suggest ? 73.
Try filtering both the input and output to
the rotary converter. On the H.T. side use
two 1 mfd. condensers with the connection
between the two to earth, and deal similarly
with the input. Two R.F. chokes, 100 turns
of 22 D.S.C. on 24in. diameter formers, one in
each side of the input, should help. Finally,
run all wiring in lead-covered cable and earth
the lead covering.
Can you give me a circuit to use a Ferranti
push-pull output transformer, now scrapped
because a Magnum speaker is used, with trans-
former fitted to the speaker ? —74.
Cannot oblige without particulars of the
transformer and the valve or valves it is
intended to use.
What size audio chokes should be used in
the enclosed short-wave receiver circuit? —75.
Choke A must be a high impedance of at
least 240 henrys. This may be obtained from
Lekmek Radio Laboratories, 75 William-street,
Sydney. The maker’s number is 53-B. Choke
B is not very critical, but should have an im-
pedance of 50 henrys.
There is no opportunity for recharging bat-
teries in my place, but I would like a foolproof
receiver. If I can receive Sydney, Brisbane,
Melbourne and Townsville I will be satisfied.
Would three or two valves do this satisfac-
torily ? —76.
Your only hope is a dry-cell-operated re-
ceiver. A tuned R.F. model with four 2-volt
low-consumption battery valves should suit.
Try Colville Wireless Equipment Co., 4 Rowe-
street, Sydney. Four valves are the minimum
for your requirements.


Ample Credit for Sound Enterprise,
During the past few years, the credit requirements of
sound productive and trading enterprises have been insuffi-
cient to provide full employment for the supply of credit
available.
This is not' an advantage to the banker. He is a
trader in credit and prefers to lend the funds available for
that purpose and thus keep his stock-in-trade employed.
By so doing he enlarges his usefulness to business in
general, and, at the same time, adds to his own profits.
Therefore, he welcomes better oversea markets for
primary products, improvements in industry, increases in
trade, and larger demands for labor, all of which lead to a
greater effective demand for credit.
Under such conditions the use of additional credit
brings advantages to all sections of the community, includ-
ing the banks. But it is essential that the loans should be
made on a safe basis. The interests of the banks, of their
depositors and of the community as a whole are closely
associated, and losses of bank funds in unsound business
would be followed by a decline in industrial and trading
activity and a consequent decrease in employment.
With the funds provided by its shareholders and
depositors, the bank desires to assist sound productive enter-
prise. Its main requirement in lending those funds is the
maintenance of the dual factors of safety and progress.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
First acceptances for the Australian
Hurdle, to be run at Caulfield next
Saturday, left Sarokos £t the head of the
‘ weights. On form to date the tearaway
grey lacks stamina to see out a journey
of slightly more than 3i miles. It will
be a poor field in point of quality. Bay
of Biscay, The Mirror, Catkin, Red Lette,
Seaveille and Rodda were discredited by
failing in the Aberfeldie Hurdle, which
Etymology won, at Moonee Valley on
Saturday.
The Mirror started favorite, but fell,
as he had done a week before. Even if
he stands up at Caulfield, he may not
see out the distance ; yet A. D. Webster
holds a high opinion of this gelding. Bay
of Biscay ran third in the G.N. Hurdle
at Flemington five seasons ago. Now ris-
ing 11 years old, he figured amongst the
also-rans at the Valley. On the other
hand, Etymology earned high praise by
smothering the leaders half a mile fron>
home and coming on to score in runaway
fashion after a dashing display of jump-
ing. H. E. Connolly knows even more
about the preparation of timber-toppers
than his brother Eric.
Punters were smitten hip and thigh at
the Valley. Wandering home in a dis-
consolate frame of mind, they read with

envy that the races in Sydney had been
postponed owing to rain. Of what avail
is fine weather when the favorites fail
in almost unbroken succession? There
were nine events. John Wren landed a
division of the juvenile handicap with
Angelo, and Jack Holt snared the second
division of the Sunset Welter with Nuit
d’Or, who belongs to Philip Russell, of
the V.R.C. committee ; but these were the
only crumbs of comfort during the after-
noon. Neither Angelo nor Nuit d’Or
was an actual loser for McShortodds, as
rival candidates were warmly supported.
Probably more big money went on Movie
Star than on Nuit d’Or, and at one
period of the wagering Movie Star
became favorite.
Angelo was followed home by Robert
(Burnewang —Hikoi) and Spokesman
(Windbag—Regal Queen), each of whom
was bred by A. G. Hunter. The last-
named is trained by J. Holt for Percy
Miller, of Sydney, and was the medium
of a heavy stable commission. Spokes-
man was only sixth at the two-furlong
post. His finishing run was suggestive of
better things in the spring. This colt is
a typical Windbag as regards stamina.
Angelo scored in runaway style. He is
by Beau Fils (sire of Waltzing Lily) from
Rosinetta, by Woorak from Rosina, by
The Welkin. In this pedigree we have
great speed lines ; yet Angelo did his best
galloping at the end of the six furlongs.
Great Legend went back to the stud
farm of his owners at Geelong after
annexing the A.J.C. Champagne Stakes.
Though above himself in condition on
Saturday, the Great Star colt was made
favorite for the first division of the
Cooee Handicap. He petered out after
travelling well for half a mile. Sunraysia
was lucky to win from Cinetheon (Pan-
theon —Valorcine). The latter was forced
on to the rails early, and Elliot lost the
use of a stirrup. Cinetheon is a clinking
good filly, sure to win soon with ordinary
luck.
Some Hero, owned by W. M. Gollan,
of Sydney, started at 5 to 2 for the first
division of the Derrimut Handicap. He
finished last, but R. Heather was cen-
sured for easing the gelding up a short
distance from the winning-post. An
inquiry disclosed that another horse had
jumped across Some Hero at the start
and ruined his chance. This event went
to Snowfelt at 12 to 1 (backed from even
longer odds), the second division ‘to
Prince Conceit at 33 to 1, the steeple-
chase to Money Tricks at 20 to 1, the
Glen Orla Handicap to Mystery Ship at
33 to 1 and the first division of the Sun-
set Welter to Eglonite at 12 to 1. is
there any wonder that wine flowed freely
when McShortodds dined at night?
* * * *
As runner-up to Prismatic in the G.N.
Hurdle, Silvion holds the best Australian
Hurdle credentials on paper. His trainer,
Alick Fullarton, was in hospital for more
than a week after winning the G.N.
Steeplechase on Woodlace, but has fully
recovered and will ride Silvion, whom
he trains. Mystic Peak impressed by his
third to Baanya and Sarokos at Caulfield
on July 21. He was only a neck behind
Sarokos and should have been second, as
the grey rolled in on him at a critical
point. There is room for improvement
in the jumping of Mystic Peak, but he
has gameness and looks a tireless gal-
loper. This scribe pins his faith to Sil-
vion, Etymology and Mystic Peak, in that
order.

With no racing in Sydney on Satur-
day because of continuous rain, many
punters transferred their literary studies
to the Epsom and Metropolitan double.
In the mile Chatham is at the head of
the quotations, and is being kept on the
safe side by the bookies. Limarch is
the popular pick in the Metropolitan.
The Bulletin’s early selection for the
Epsom, Whittingham, has been freely
coupled with the Dominion-owned horse.
Another double to receive excellent
support is the stable combination of The
Masquerader and Nightly. ■ They are
trained by Fred Jones of Limerick fame,
and are expected to arrive from M.L.
next week. The Masquerader, who is
related to Veilmond, is a four-year-old
and has Bst. 31b. in the Epsom. Recently
he beat Silver Ring over seven furlongs.
Nightly is recognised, as the Dominion’s
best stayer. He is a fine type of four-
year-old by Night Raid, sire of Phar
Lap and Nightmarch, from Miss Muriel,
who traces back to St v Simon and Nor-
denfeldt. He has Bst. 131 b. in the
Metrop. In the Canterbury Cup, 12
furlongs, he beat the N.Z. Cup winner
Palantus and Red Manfred.
* * * *
O’Sullivan topped the list of success-
ful jockeys in N.S.W. last season with
684 wins. He was followed by Bartle, D.
Munro, McCarten, Knox, Pratt, Parsons
and Britt.
* . * * *
Ned Moss is in the happy position of
having two three-year-olds, Sir John and
Theo, who look certain to play promi-
nent parts in the spring racing. Sir John
is trained by Price, Theo by Williams.
Both colts have wintered well. Sir John
is the logical favorite for the Derby and
is being tipped for the Melbourne Cen-
tenary Cup ; but Randwick opinion is
that Theo is likely to turn out the
superior.
* * * *
Is the Caulfield Cup to be Silver
Scorn’s mission? In some quarters the
in-and-out mare is reckoned the handi-
capper’s tip for that race. In the Epsom
and Metrop. she has 9st. 61b. arid 9st.
respectively; at Caulfield she Has Bst.
131 b. She has been favorite since the
appearance of the weights. Silver Scorn
is doing well at Randwick, and has lost
the ragged appearance she had when she
arrived from beyond the Tasman.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Mitt Shover”: Nel Tarleton, who
was fighting in Australia a few months
ago but suddenly returned to Britain,
was not long getting among the money
in the Old Country. At Liverpool last
week he won the British featherweight
title by outpointing the holder, Seaman
Watson, in a 15-round mill. Tarleton is
now to fight Fred Miller, who holds the
world’s feather title.
* * * *
Lurich looked big enough to make a
meal of Tommy Nylan at Leichhardt,
though alleged to weigh only 111 b. more,
and he seemed very slow. He was out-
wrestled from the first bell until Nylan
pinned him with a short-arm scissors
hold in the second round. After getting
a fall in the fourth, Lurich began fight-
ing all and sundry, opponent, seconds
and referee, and was disqualified.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australians started another picnic
match on Friday, this time against Scot-
land at Edinburgh. By way, presum-
ably, of giving the spectators full value
for their saxpences, both sides played
slow-motion cricket, only 251 going up
by stumps. Continuous rain prevented
play on Saturday, and Australia thus lost
an anticipated day’s spell. Kippax skip-
pered our side, and the toss was lost to
Australia for the tenth time in succes-
sion. The Scots totalled only 107, 69
of these being contributed by C. S.
Dempster, the crack All-Black batsman,
who had been declared by the Lyon King
at Arms, head of the Scottish College of
Heralds, to have had an ancestor who
fought under Bruce at Bannockburn.
Fleetwood-Smith was again a trout
among the minnows, taking 6 for 45.
Oldfield caught Dempster off Wall, and
Ebeling also worked his passage with
3-31. At stumps, Australia had lost
Brown (33), Ponsford (14) and Chipper-
field (18). McCabe was 67 n.o. and
Barnett 7 n.o. The total was 144. Baxter,
the Lancashire-Scot who troubled Aus-
tralia in the first innings against Lanca-
shire, could not turn out for his native
land.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg”: The Australian
cricket fielder (B. 25/7/’34) has arrived.
One of Sydney’s best-known bagmen
has opened a double book on the last
Test. Punters are asked to pick the
highest scorer on each side in either inn-
ings. If a non-starter is backed, the
bet’s off. At last quotes Bradman and
Ponsford, with Walters and Hammond,
were most in demand. A chance here for
someone to take a wild fly and couple
O’Reilly and Bowes —you never know
in cricket, and the odds on that brace
should be good enough for anything.

Foot brawl
The meeting of South Melbourne and
Collingwood drew 30,000 to Victoria
Park, when South played beautiful ’ball
for two hours. The Magpies, on the
other hand, were sluggish and untidy.
From the bounce South looked like win-
ning, and when the bell rang it held 145
points to ’Wood’s 97. On present form
South would beat all-comers ; ' whether
it can hold the fort for nine more weeks
is another matter. Of its 18, Nash, Rob-
ertson and Austin showed up; of
’Wood’s, Murphy, Kyne and G. Coventry.
Geelong came up to St. Kilda, where it
has so often met disaster, and up to
lemon-time looked like repeating the ex-
perience. The last quarter saw the Sea-
siders put up a series of drives that
swept aside the speedier Saints, and gave
Geelong victory by 114 to 84. So nearly
matched are the five leading teams that,
while defeat would have put Geelong
out of “the four,” victory placed it first. 1
’Wood is second; South, Carlton and
Richmond equal for third, with Richmond
a trifle the worst on percentage. That
same Richmond expected to be in first
place, but Melbourne’s staggering run of
six goals in the last quarter upset
the fruit cart and the Tigers went down
by 95 to Melb.’s 101. Carlton kept its
place by compiling 145 to Hawthorn’s
66. Fitzroy outed North with 142 to 98 ;
and Footscray temporarily settled an old
score with Essendon by gathering in 99
to ’Don’s 57.

rivalled the famed mud baths of Mucka-
dilla (Q.). By far the most interesting
match in the Union series, and that
because the winners adapted themselves
to conditions and used their heads, was
the 21-0 victory of Eastern Suburbs,
holders of the wooden spoon, over West-
ern Suburbs. Eastern never handled the
ball when possible to avoid it, backs and
forwards going ahead with it on the
ground and dribbling over the line. The
winners scored 6 tries and a p.g. and
had the opposition flummoxed from start
to finish. University would have beaten
Randwick if it had used its fine forwards
for the same tactics. It didn’t, and was
deservedly beaten 5-0. At Manly the
locals won 13-6 from Parramatta, and
Northern Suburbs sloshed around at
Hurstville until it emerged victor over
St. George by 8-0.
* * * *
Weather conditions were also respon-
sible for some - upsets in the League
matches, the defeat of Western Suburbs
by St. George by 7 to 6 being an instance.
There is a lot more grass on the Sports
Ground than most of the others, but not
nearly enough on this occasion. South
Sydney, won after a slogging battle with
Newtown at the latter’s ground by 11-5.
At Trumper Park Eastern Suburbs served
University with its weekly helping ofl
wallop, scores being 22-7. North Sydney,
notoriously the worst wet ground in
Sydney, was the scene of some glorious
mudlarking between North Sydney and
Balmain. North led 8-5 at the interval,
but determined attack by the Tigers saw
the home side barely home at the whistle
by 11-10.

Racquet and Bawl
England got a splendid start in the
challenge match for the Davis Cup with
America at Wimbledon, taking the first
two singles. Austin, who failed in the
Wimbledon championships, beat Shields
in three straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, 6-1. Perry
showed signs of being rattled at one
period of his match with Wood, but even-
tually won well by three sets to two,
scores being 6-1, 4-6, 5-7, 6-0, 6-3.

Under the Whip
“Retired Urger”: Following the
example of its Queensland brethren,
the Sydney s.-p. fraternity has set up a
mutual insurance society to preserve
members from financial loss through the
intrusions of the law. So popular has
the scheme become that even the lads
who operate the “outer” on some vacant
allotment near a course have come in.
Weekly premiums are paid, and after a
conviction a member pays a double ante,
because his fine will be heavier next
time. Already the system is said to have
reduced overhead costs considerably.
For years those betting on the outers
had to employ one or more “cockatoos”
to give warning when a John Hop was
spotted. The pay used to be 10s. a day,
but recently the “cockatoos” struck for
a half-crown rise.

“Carpet”: Of those sports who applied
to be received again into the V.R.C. fold,
nine got new tickets: Tehan, Evans,
Howson, Scanlon, Brady, Scarlett,
Morris, Bastian and Egan. All faced
the V.R.C. committee in turn, and were
even questioned as to how they had
earned a crust during two years of sus-
pension. Three of the applicants were
turned down, and permission to ride
work, which had recently been granted,
was cancelled.

“Thormanby”: What is said to be a
record price for an English thoroughbred
was given at Newmarket last week,
when the Maharajah of Rajpipla parted
with his Derby winner Windsor Lad
for £50,000. Tracery, one of the greatest
sires since St. Simon, and one well repre-
sented in Australia, is said to have
changed hands for £53,000, but the price
was never confirmed. The previous best
was £47,000, given by a syndicate for the
10-year-old Solario. Windsor Lad’s new
owner is a Newmarket studmaster named
Benson, but the horse will race in the
Maharajah’s colors for this season, one
of his engagements being a meeting with
Colombo in the Doncaster St. Leger.
Then he goes to the stud.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australians must have encoun-
tered a cross-eyed Chinaman on their
way to Headingley on the last day of the
fourth Test. With victory only a matter
of an hour or so and plenty of time
ahead, a tremendous thunderstorm
flooded the ground and made further
play impossible. As a result, the fifth
Test at the Oval will have to be played
out.
Australia carried its score to 494 on
the Saturday. That was 294 ahead
of the Englishmen, and, in the opinion
of many good judges, had Woodfull
closed at that on Monday morning the
game would have been won before the
rain could seriously interfere. He chose
to bat on, giving instructions for forc-
ing the pace. Bradman ran to 304, when
Bowes bowled him. McCabe fell to the
same bowler for 27, and only 90 runs
were added, the innings closing at 584.
Bowes bowled in fine form to finish with
6 for 142.
The English batsmen decided to dig
in at their second try, and at stumps on
Monday had lost 4 for 188. Walters
again scored consistently with 45, Wyatt
was bowled by Grimmett for 44, Ham-
mond was run out for 20 and Keeton
scratched himself out against Grimmett.
On Tuesday morning the wicket had
been soaked, but was playing easily, while
the bowlers had to use sawdust. An odd
shower or two temporarily held up the
game, and the dismissal of Hendren
(a 2) and Ames (8) by O’Reilly and
Grimmett respectively made England’s
cake look doughier than ever. Leyland
was not out 49, and Hopwood 2, both
leading a perilous existence against
O’Reilly, when the washout decided the
issue. Grimmett took three of the
wickets and O’Reilly two.
* * * *
Australia followed up the fourth Test
with a two-day match at Sunderland
against Durham, the only second-class
county to meet the tourists. Durham
was dismissed for 73, Fleetwood-Smith
taking 7 for 21. Australia closed with
314 up for 3 wickets, Brown getting yet
another duck. Bromley hit stoutly for
97, and Kippax broke his long run of
bad luck with 101 n.o. Darling made
34, and Ponsford, with 66, was with
Kippax at the closure. Durham’s second
try yielded 204 for 6 wickets, and the
“It’s the second time you’ve done that after the whistle’s gone.”
“Don’t be too hard, ref. — tat te only time I can catch t’at cow.”
match was drawn. Oldfield, Woodfull
and Brown were among our “bowlers.”
Adamson, a class batsman, scored 23
and 52 for the county. He comes of
a family noted in Durham cricket and
Rugby. Old hands on this side will re-
member C. Y. Adamson, who came to
Australia in 1899 as a half-back with
Mullineux’s British Rugby side. He was
a good cricketer to boot, and his left-
hand bowling proved useful to Queens-
land elevens before he left this country
again.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Bradman’s big score at
Headingley has jumped him to the top
of the Test averages, which he now heads
with 72.83 for six innings. Leyland tops
the English list with 70.20, but has a n.o.
innings to help. Ponsford and McCabe
are not far behind the leader with 70.25
and 67.16. Among the English there is a
long drop from Leyland to Sutcliffe, who
has averaged 59.50. Third is Walters,
with 56 for six completed innings. Con-
sidering that his best score was 82, this
shows rare consistency in a young player
appearing as opening batsman for Eng-
land. O’Reilly and Verity have bagged
24 wickets each. Verity’s average,
helped by the sticky-wicket match at
Lord’s, is the better—l7.oB against
O’Reilly’s 22.79. Grimmett has taken
17 for 29.47 apiece. Outside Verity, the
English bowlers have not distinguished
themselves, though Bowes has collected
10 for a cost of 26.40.
Footbrawl
“Hotham”: I was talking of the
violence which, as even papers like the
“Age” and “Argus” admit, is becoming
so prevalent in Melbourne football.
The man to whom I spoke was a mild
little person who 1 don’t think ever
swatted anything but a mosquito in his
life. Said he airily, when told that one
man was still in bed a week after an
assault during play, “That shows what
interest we take in our game in Mel-
bourne.” I had to let it go at that.
“S.T.S.”: “Fitzcray” is right (B.
4/7/’34) about the football umpire (Aus-
tralian Rules) not being given enough
power. He is not given a fair go in
general. He is the only sporting official
of any kind assumed always to be quite
probably wrong. Every paper that
comes my. way reviews his performance
along with that of the players, and fre-
quently finds fault with it. What respect
can players have for him next time?
“Get the best man you can, and trust
him absolutely,” is the only rule for
sport.
* * * *
“Verneuk”: That trumpeting over the
All-Blacks’ alleged decision to abolish
the wing-forward (B. 25/7/’34) may be
a bit ill-timed. It is announced that Cliff
Porter, most blastiferous of all wing-
forwards, has accompanied the team with
a view to giving it a few tips. The pro-
bability is that if the M.L. pack finds that
if it can hold the Australians comfortably
with seven men the single back-row lad
will just be our old friend the winger
over again. Unless some of the selected
N.S.W. team for the first match in Sydney
with the visitors give a better exhibition
of honest shoving in the pack than they
have done hitherto this is certain to
happen.
“Stoush": Curious is the geographical
distribution of football. The professional
Rugby League, played in Australia only
by N.S.W. and Queensland, is rigorously
confined in England to a narrow strip
across Lancashire and Yorkshire, while
Soccer and Rugby Union flourish through-
out Britain. Last season a tin-hare mag-
nate attempted to introduce Rugby
League to London. He bought a Lan-*
cashire club named Wigan Highfield on
the hoof and transplanted it to the
White City. In spite of much press
propaganda, and even a match against
the Australian side in England last
season, the unhappy bantling has expired
from inanition.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Lakeside”: The American P.G.A.
has notified its Australian cobber that
it has decided to dispatch a team of six
professional golfers to Australia, the
team sailing on November 12 and re-
turning on December 12. The Austra-
lians have been asked to submit a list
of 15 Americans in the order preferred,
and the American P.G.A. will do its best
to get them. The communique states
that any of the players invited will make
the trip, on which they are very keen.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: One of the Sydney
papers recently published a photograph
of a golfer lofting his ball over a cow
which stood between him and the
green. It was an unnecessary risk to
take. Not being on the putting green,
tlje cow could not be counted a loose
impediment and therefore shifted, but
the caddie might have been employed to
incite the creature to chase him by mak-
ing faces or some other method disliked
by cows, and Strawberry could thus have
been got out of the way without incur-
ring the risk of losing a stroke.
* * * *
“Black Jack”: Golfers are more sub-
ject to accidents than most people with
their eye on football and motoring
suppose. I note that a man at Castle-
maine, birthplace of the Wild Colonial
Boy, hit a ball into a tree with
such violence that, rebounding, it struck
him on the nose and laid him out cold.
Writer once saw a similar happening on
the Charters Towers (N.Q.) links. A
player found his ball cupped in a deep
cow-track dried as hard as iron. He
tried to play it out with a niblick, and the
ball went straight up into the air. While
he was looking wildly round to see where
it had gone it landed on his head. He
was bald, and, though wearing a
cap, took the count. When reviving
him we found the lump on his nut was
bigger than the ball that had caused it.
* * * *
“Brassey”: Apropos of guarantees to
the team of American professional
golfers to visit Australia, it has been
stated that Sydney and Melbourne
have already made contributions and that
another from a third capital city is
desired. The Vic. G.A. has given a
guarantee; the Sydney contribution
comes from the Professional Golfers’
Association. So far the governing body
of the game in the Ma State has made
no offer —if it has, no news of it has
leaked into the press. It is up to Bris-
bane, which is always wailing about the
way southern golfers ignore its attrac-
tions, to come along with a guarantee.
South Australia might also help. Can-
berra, thick with politicians who never
pay for anything they can avoid, is
hopeless.
Racquet and Bawl
Australia’s hopes of challenging Eng-
land for the Davis Cup crashed in spite
of the good start made by winning the
first two singles. Lott and Stoeffen won
from Crawford and Quist in the doubles
by three sets to one. America took both
the remaining singles. Wood was lead-
ing Crawford by two sets to nil when
rain caused postponement. Next morn-
ing, Crawford made a gallant fight to
win the next two and equalise the scores.

“Top Spin”: Joan Hartigan put up
such a fine showing at Wimbledon and
in the Irish championships that her bar-
rackers expected her to come to light
with an outstanding success before the
British season closed. The N.S.W. girl
got away with the Scottish title last week
after a bitter scrap with Miss Noel, whom
she finally beat 5-7, 14-12, 7-5—50
games in all. As it is likely she will go
to Berlin for the German championships,
in which some of our Davis Cuppers
are expected to compete, she may add

was already marked out as a potential
Davis Cup champion, and the joyous
spirit in which he played the game made
him a great favorite with tournament
crowds. In his short career he had won
a place in the South Australian team,
and in the Australian championships at
Melbourne last year was runner-up for
the junior title. A Prince Alfred College
boy, he was well known in Sydney and
Melbourne as a Linton Cup player,

Miscellaneous
“Stanislaus”: A sporting event which.
in California at least, outvies in interest
a whole series of Test matches between
England and Australia came off at
Angel’s Camp recently—the annual
jumping-frog contest instituted to com-
meniorate Mark Twain’s story of “Dan'l
Webster.” There were 250 entrants, and
20,000 attended to see them perform.
Each frog is allowed three forward
movements, which are counted as jumps,
whether they are or not. On this occa-
sion the championship was won by
General Ulysses S. Grant, who covered
12ft. sin. The undefeated ex-champion
and record-holder, Budweiser, who was
turned out to swamp a couple of years
ago, was brought by a grateful owner
to watch the vain attempts on his figures
of 13ft. lin. As the first prize is £5OO,
there was some reason for the gratitude,
Budweiser having won it thrice.

“Roque”: Second only in importance
to the coming of the All-Blacks is the
news that an English croquet team has
been selected to tour Australia. Though
there are no particulars as to weights,
etc., the side must be a hefty lot, since
all are star performers and enjoy an
exalted social eminence. The skipper is
Colonel Du Pre, several times open
champion, and the others are Reginald
Poulter, Ward-Petley and Sir Francis
Colchester-Wemyss. Social and croquet

the world’s 1000-mile figures, and did
so by 9hrs. 43min. The Australian has
come in for an unexpected windfall. An
enthusiast named Camillis has given
him £1 a week for so long as his records
remain unbroken. “Oppy” was to have
embarked last week to compete in the
centenary race round Victoria. That
over he will make for Europe again.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Taxation “Jokes”
Taxation officers are usually polite in
their dealings with the public. But they
rarely assist the taxpayer in trying to
arrive at his true taxable income when
by not assisting him the figure may be
increased.
A Sydney businessman died shortly
before the 1932-33 taxation year closed.
His income came from many sources. In
making returns most people are allowed
to include income actually received by
them during the year, or income earned,
whether received or not. Whichever
method is adopted, it works out practi-
cally the same over a period of years.
The executor did not know which
method had been used by the taxpayer
when alive. No copy of, returns could
be found amongst his effects. Permis-
sion was asked to inspect returns filed
at the taxation office. It was refused.
The object of the taxation authority,
obviously, was to try to find out whether
the deceased had failed to disclose
income which might be revealed in his
executor’s return.
That executor has received no claims
for unpaid taxes in previous years.
Neither has he received any notice of
inclusion of income in the last return
on which tax had previously been paid.
The testator was a man of honor, and
the executor believes that all income
was included. But whether the estate
will be overcharged is something he can’t
check.
This attitude of adjudging a man a
criminal until he proves himself inno-
cent is typical of taxation adminis-
trators. It is as tyrannous as the present
practice of foisting the job of collecting
unemployment-relief tax on private
enterprise without remuneration. As a
result the taxpayer feels no sense of
virtue when he makes his contribution
to the cost of government and upkeep
of civil servants ; he just looks on him-
self as a victimised fool.
These taxation departments are all
alike. A business in N.S.W. with an
office in Queensland is compelled by the
Queensland concern to pay tax on what
it considers to be the profit earned in
Queensland. The N. S. Wales depart-
ment taxes on the whole of the busi-
ness’s profits, whether earned in Queens-
land or elsewhere. Neither State will give
away anything; the taxpayer can do
nothing but pay, and curse the futility of
taking legal action which will be fought
through the courts on public money.
Firms in other States are closing down
their Queensland offices, and conducting
Queensland business from headquarters.
In this way thousands of pounds in
wages and rents —a great deal more than
the taxes paid—are being lost to the
northern State.
Statistics Astray
Six months ago we were jubilant about
the splendid recovery in wool. The
Sydney price index stood at 208 in
January, double the figure of the pre-
ceding year. The statistical position was
sound. But there has been an unbroken
decline in prices since, and on July 16
the index stood at 133, just about the
same as in July, 1933. The important
difference is that in 1933 the market was
rising : at present it is falling steeply.
The world wants our wool. Many
countries are in great need of the staple.
But so disorganised are the finances of
those countries, and so greatly are their
fiscal policies wrapped up with politics,
that all sorts of emergency restrictions
have been imposed on external trade.
Germany, whether genuinely or as a
bluff, is threatening the Australian wool-
grower’s livelihood by making intense
research towards the production of syn-
thetic wool. If a practicable substitute
can be turned out, even at a greater
cost than the real thing, Germany may
continue to shut out wool imports so
long as her foreign trade balance
threatens the stability of her currency.
Italy’s foreign trade is heavily against
her. She is rationing wool imports from
Australia as from August 1. Tariffs,
apparently, are not enough in these coun-
tries. Italy talks of lack of reciprocity
in trade as far as Australia is concerned,
but someone had to get it in the neck ;
the adverse trade balance couldn’t go on
indefinitely.
The statistical position of wool is
sound —Hip to a point. When using
statistics nowadays to anticipate the
course of commodity prices, supply and
demand is not such a dependable guide
as it used to be. To maintain currency
stability desperate measures have been
applied in Europe. Millions of people
who want our wool aren’t being allowed
to have it. Until the crises in Germany
and Italy pass statistics on the wool
position will have to be surveyed with
circumspection.
Dominion Tobacco Corp.
The conspiracy charge laid against
W. J. Moran and Rupert Carrick, for-
merly directors of the Dominion Tobacco
Corp., and R. H. Lane, salesman, was
proceeded with in Vic. Criminal Court
last week before Lowe, J., and a jury.
Joseph V. Roberts, formerly secretary,
said that there had never been a meeting
of shareholders, no dividends were de-
clared, and the books were never audited.
In the beginning about £290 was col-
lected to cover preliminary exes., the
lenders to be given shares as security.
Roberts was engaged to assist in forming
the co. about March, 1932.
After the Dominion Tobacco Corp.
was formed, according to Roberts, the
three directors met and allotted, with the
exception of 20,000 never issued, the
whole of the 75,000 shares amongst them-
selves. Witness got 2500, of which he
“If we was to sing ‘Gawd Save the King,’ d’yer think ’e’d stop an’ stand to
attention?”
sold 400 at £1 each. Associated Brokers
and Underwriters was formed about the
same time to sell the tobacco co.’s bonds
and shares; the shares in the broking
co. were allotted by the accused, mostly
to themselves, on the same day as the
Tobacco Corp. whack-up. Each director
got 3333 shares, and witness was given
500.
The rake-off to Associated Brokers on
the sale of bonds was to be 25 p.c., and
15 p.c. on shares. This commission and
other exes, were taken out of moneys
paid into the office. Both cos. occupied
the same office, and in addition to the
secretary a clerk was employed.
No factory was acquired, no orders
for tobacco or cigarettes were received,
and, except for a dismantled machine
and cutter, no plant was bought. But
the concern handled 136 bales of
tobacco-leaf; 88 it paid for in shares.
The plant was later returned to the
vendor, and about £530 was distributed
among the directors.
By direction of the ludge, Carrick
was discharged. Lane said that if only
half the money had been paid up on
Tobacco Corp.’s bonds manufacture
could have been commenced, and within
a year or two there would have been
profits. Moran said the co. never
obtained sufficient money to make a
start; bondholders ceased to pay. He
had been honest in his transactions.
The jury disagreed, and Lane and
Moran were remanded for re-trial.
Forward dealing in shares on Sydney
Stock Exchange will be reintroduced on
August 7. The great speculation in gold
scrip collapsed following the Tullamore
sensation ; the ban on buying and selling
at six weeks was imposed on June 22.
With only cash transactions allowed, the
gold market has been very quiet. For-
ward dealing will be allowed only in the
vestibule, and the business done will not
be officially quoted.
Sydney Stock Exchange commission
rates are far too high, particularly on
mining scrip. A few years ago, when
mining-share activity was a dead letter,
they may have been justified. At the
present time they have the effect of dis-
couraging quick profit-taking. On the
sale of a mining share at a price between
Is. and 35., both buyer and seller pay
Id. brokerage, which means that to buy
and sell again the market has to rise
more than 2d. for the speculator to make
a profit. On a share bought ‘and sold
around ss. 6d. a rise of over 4d. is
necessary.

Petrol prices dropped again last week.
First grade (not leaded) is being marketed
at Is. 4d. a gallon. Second grade is going
through the pumps at Is. 3d. in Sydney
and Melbourne. Ethylised spirit, which
came on to the market at Is. 6d., has since
been reduced Id. Prices for ordinary
first-grade have never been so low.

Work is to start within a week or two
on the Mackay outer harbor. A. G.
Stronach, of Brisbane, was the success-
ful tenderer with a price of £785,213.
As from to-day (August 1) Italy is to
start cutting down her imports of Austra-
lian wool. Last season she took 200,894
bales, which figure is to be halved dur-
ing the current term. Italy, it is com-
plained, has asked for tariff concessions
in view of the unfavorable trade balance
with Australia, and got none.

Since quarterly motor-car registrations
were introduced in N. S. Wales in 1932,
a fee of 20s. for the first quarter and ss.
for each succeeding quarter has been
charged during each year of registration.
After September 1 the fees in respect of
cars already continuously registered will
be ss. for each quarter. New vehicles
will have to pay 20s. for the first quarter
and ss. thereafter.
Vic. Royal Auto Club is objecting to
the Compulsory Insurance Bill being
rushed through without proper considera-
tion. The terms of the proposed standard
policy are not included in the draft, be-
ing merely referred to in Section 2. A
most important part of the proposed
legislation is thus to be brought in
through a side door without even Parlia-
mentary discussion. Motorists demand
a chance to pass their opinion first.
N.S.W. bakers are not permitted to
start work before 5.30 a.m.; last week
they asked to be allowed to commence at
4 a.m. Minister for Labor Dunningham
said he wasn’t satisfied that the public
would be in pocket if the change were
granted. A saving in costs amounting
to a farthing a loaf was mentioned. The
breadcarters objected' because “they
would be gradually eliminated.”

Uncle Sam took delivery of 900 hogs-
heads of Australian wine last week ; the
casks arrived in perfect condition, for
which Australian coopers are being
praised by their N’Yark brothers. “There
was no leakage during the voyage,” says
the cable, so master and crew of the
vessel deserve a word of praise, too.

Hopes are that 4000 cases of S. Aus-
tralian oranges will be allowed into
Maoriland off the Waitaki on August 13.
There is a shortage of citrus fruits, par-
ticularly in the South Island, and nego-
tiations are in train for the entry of
further shipments of Australian oranges.
The Maoriland embargo on the fruit
arose out of Australia’s attitude towards
M.L. spuds.

The N. S. Wales wheat harvest for
the 1933-34 season is estimated at
55,000,000 bushels. On July 7 the quan-
tity stored in silos was 25,000,000
bushels. Exports of the grain and its
products have fallen away to a fraction
of the, 1933 figures. The Sydney price
index on July 16 was 83, the highest
since September, 1933 ; it compares with
an average of 82 in 1933, 88 in 1932 and
70 in 1931. The 1911 figure is the base
(100). The non-rural commodity-price
index, which indicates what the farmer
has to pay for the goods he buys, was
166 on the same basis.

The Maffra beet-sugar factory, a Vic-
torian Government concern that benefits
under the sugar embargo, has been
accused by local ratepayers of earning
huge profits and ruining the shire’s roads.
Profits of £156,000 over the past three
years are alleged ; the roads are being
damaged by carting beet to the factory.

Last week Walter G. Jacoby was sen-
tenced to 18 months’ hard labor on a
false-pretences charge in connection with
a “Clever Titles” competition conducted
by him in Melbourne. Three others
charged with conspiracy along with
Jacoby were found not guilty. The
Crown case was that in four com-
petitions there was not one genuine
winner of a first, second or third prize,
and that cheques made out to
prizewinners were endorsed by Jacoby
and paid back into the competition bank
account. An alleged security of £lOO
lodged with one Sivewright was non-
existent. Sivewright said the records
showed a loss on the competitions up to
December last; in February Jacoby told
him that the entries were not sufficient
to pay the prizes.
Perkins, Minister for the Interior, is
sponsoring a bill for carrying out new
works on the Murray and the Murrum-
bidgee. Five new barrages at the mouth
of the Murray are proposed, two weirs
across the ’Bidgee, the completion of
the Yarrawonga weir and the building
of a roadway over the Hume dam. Cost
of the lot is put at £1,200,000. The
three States concerned have agreed to
necessary variations in the River Murray
agreement.
“Mundowie”: The creeks at the head
of the Katherine R.iver, North Australia,
are known to carry gold, tin and various
kinds of gems, and systematic prospecting
might do much for that district. It was
thereabouts that one of the largest
diamonds found in Australia was dis-
covered. The gem was got in the early
1890’s by Dick Richardson, who was
hen-scratching about the bed of the
Cullen Creek, a feeder of the Fergussori,
in turn a tributary of the Katherine.
“Kaloa”: The “shinplaster” or “cala-
bash” still runs current in north-western
Queensland and the N.T., but in such
polite form that its own mother wouldn’t
recognise it. In its crude past it used
to be written on a bit of the local rag or
a brown-paper bag or an old bill:
“lOU £5. Bill Smith, Drover” ; or “To
Jimmy Woodser, Storekeeper, The Deep
End. Pay Bearer five quid, my account.
BILL.” Now the stores of Boulia and
the Rankine adopt neatly-printed forms
in which the date and signature only are
written: “10th June, 1934. Fieldings,
Merchants and Importers, Boulia, Five
shillings” with the signature; or just
an ordinary cheque on some bank
hundreds of miles away with the denomi-
nation printed. There must be two or
three thousand pounds’ worth of this
private currency circulating, apart from
personal cheques, which sometimes pass
from hand to hand through a whole
season. The Commonwealth Bank might
well establish a travelling branch for the
benefit of little towns and stations of
the border country.

I, PERCY FREDERICK GRAHAM GORDON, Acting General Manager of The Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited, do solemnly and sincerely declare that the Reserve Fund,
the Exchange Adjustment Reserve, and accumulated profits are used in the business, and that the accompanying Statement and Balance Sheet of the Bank is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true in every particular. /
Names, addresses, and occupations of the persons who are the Directors of the Company at the date of the Statement: JOHN LANGLEY WEBB, Shipowner, Melbourne:
ROBERT CHANCELLOR MEARES, Solicitor. Melbourne: ACHALEN WOOLLISCROFT PALFREYMAN, Manufacturer, Melbourne; WILLIAM HOWELL SWANTON, Merchant,
Melbourne; ARTHUR SYDNEY BAILLIEU, Investor, Melbourne.
And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of an Act of the Parliament of Victoria rendering persons making
a false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt perjury.
Declared at Melbourne, in the State of Victoria, this 24th day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-four.
Before me--J. J. C. CROWE. P. F. G. GORDON.
A Commissioner for taking Declarations and Affidavits under the “Evidence Act 1915.”
We, WILLIAM HOWELL SW ANTON and ARTHUR SYDNEY BAILLIEU, of Melbourne, being Directors of The Commercial Ban* of Australia Limited, do hereby certify that
in our opinion the foregoing Balance Sheet is true and correct, and is drawn up so as to exhibit a true and correct view of the state of the Company’s affairs.
On behalf of the Board.
W. H. SWANTON.
Dated at Melbourne this 24th day of July, 1934. ARTHUR S. BAILLIEU.
mentioned in the new His Majesty's,
except facetiously as a rather old-
fashioned bird who dealt in drama and
suchlike irrelevancies. “White Horse
Inn,” on the spectacular side, was a visual
symphony in which the changes were
rung on the sartorial fashions allegedly
affected by the inhabitants of the Aus-
trian Tyrol. There were no slow move-
ments in it ; it was all scored scherzo, so
to speak. Hence, after the first three or
four crises, the eye longed for a little
rest and quiet, in order to prepare itself
for the next. The Marquartsteiner
troupe of Tyrolean dancers, who slap
their thighs and each other’s faces, was
an original turn, the gymnastics of Jack
and Sylvia Kellaway were of outstanding
skilfulness and the ballets showed the
discipline which only a J.C.W. ballet can
show. Strella Wilson and Sydney Bur-
chall were allowed an occasional burst of
song, and Charles Norman and Arthur
Stigant interpolated some amiable
comedy; but what appeared to be
urgently called for was a bit of human
personality. An Ada Reeve would have
made a considerable part of the haber-
dashery superfluous, and given the audi-
ence a welcome holiday from a prolonged
optical debauch. However, the elaborate
futility, for what it sets out to do, is to
be commended as the knock-out of its
class.
* * *
“Gay Divorce,” which was at Melb.
King’s seven months ago and which more
recently had a little season in Brisbane,
came to Sydney Royal on Saturday night
as a vehicle for the talents of Madge
Elliott and Cyril Ritchard. Save for Gus
Bluett’s fruity performance as Tonetti,
professional co-respondent, it is a rather
dull affair, not at all cheered by the
songandance interludes provided by the
Elliott-Ritchard duo every 15 minutes.
The music is as slight as the voices of the
principals, and the jests are blackened by
long exposure to smoke-rooms. Sixteen
shapely girls, most of the time in bathing
undress, punctuate the piece with ballets,
but, for some reason or the other, pro-
bably good, they don’t sing. Scenery and
dressing lack distinction. A bright ray is
the sophisticated babyishness of Isabelle
Mahon in a small part, but one feels that
little candle wouldn’t shed its beams so
far in less monotonous surroundings.
The three Australian composers who
mounted the rostrum at Melbourne
Town Hall one night last week and con-
ducted the Philharmonic Society and a
full orchestra through work of their own
composition were as unlike in build as
their opuses. Sydneyite Lindley Evans is
extraordinarily tall and excessively thin
and as full of nervous energy as a tiger-
cat. His “Australian Symphony” is set
to verses, by George Essex Evans, which
are more remarkable for literary artifice
than real emotion. Composer Evans’s
music is a careful attempt at illustration
of the poem, and therein it is a failure,
like most attempts at illustration. Any-
body who had not read the poem would
not have known what on earth the
musician was discoursing about. He cer-
tainly would not have known that he
was describing mangrove shores, scrub-
vines, maidenhair fern, yellow leas and
hills, purple or any other color. As
music, however, the symphony is far
from commonplace. In fact, it has many
passages of decided beauty, especially
where it bridges the gaps between the
singing. But as the ladies and gentlemen
of the Philharmonic choir were not in
the best of spirits at the moment, and
as the piece leans heavily on the choral
element, it had not as fair a chance with
the audience as it should have.
William James, who is slighter and
shorter than his predecessor, conducted
the orchestra through his ballet music
from the dance play “By Candelight,”
which is also slighter than its prede-
cessor. It tells the story of a debutante’s
dream and her awaking, and has grace
and liveliness.
Alfred Hill’s operatic Maori legend
“Hinemoa,” which filled the last half of
the programme, is in a different category
from the others. Hill, who by reason of
some residence there is claimed by
Maoriland, although he was born in Vic-
toria, is short and sturdy and dynamic ;
and his music is vigorous, robust, direct
and often passionate. Hinemoa’s song
by the lakeside in scene 11, in fact all
her numbers, have the rightness of real
feeling, without a trace of sentimentality,
and they were sung by Isolde Hill with
remarkable intelligence. The recitative,
through which Tutanekai’s flute is heard
calling, is genuinely lovely. It seemed to
present writer that the composer was not
in his element in the fairies’ chorus,
which sounded monotonous ; but Hine-
moa’s plunge into the lake, her dusky
lover's search for his supposed enemy
amongst the raupo and his discovery of
his dripping inamorata were conveyed
magnificently. The final duet between
the lovers was another effective item in
which A. C. Bartleman’s baritone was
heard to advantage. Tom Downie was
Tiki and F. G. Lumsden the Maori
prophet, and the Philharmonics as Maori
maidens and Ra-Ha warriors rose to the
occasion in the final chorus. This is the
first time Melbourne has heard her dis-
tinguished son’s 25-year-old composition.
* * *
On a couple of afternoons last week
Sydney Town Hall was the rendezvous
of regimented troops of children of all
school ages sent to have their faculty of
musical appreciation improved by Prof.
Bernard Heinze, of Melbourne, and the
A.B.C. Symphony Orchestra. What the
kids thought about it can’t be guessed,
but they sat as still as mice while the
Prof, gave a jocose little lecture on instru-
mentation, illustrated by members of the
band, and to “Ye Banks and Braes,”
played first by strings, then by wood-
winds, then by brasses and finally in full
polychrome. First movement of Schu-
bert’s “Unfinished” followed, the two
themes being first stated. As the Prof,
remarked, they are two of the most
beautiful conceptions in the whole realm
of pure music. The symphonic treat-
ment of them, lovely as it is, is hardly
meat for babes, but the conductor
thought the experiment worth trying, and
he may have been right. Roger Quilter’s
“Children’s Overture,” the Saint-Saens
“Danse Macabre,” Liadow’s “Musical
Snuff-box” and one of German’s “Nell
Gwynne” dances were less debatable
fare, and their appeal was unmistakable.
y
Dr. Bainton, Sydney Con.’s new
director, showed his paces as a pianist
at a concert in honor of his predecessor,
Dr. Orchard. Dr. Bainton played John
Ireland’s “April” and “Island Spell” and
his own composition “White Hyacinth.”
His style is very clear and crisp—magis-
terial is the word that suggests itself —
and seems to spring from much study of
Bach. On the same programme figured
three songs and a ballade for violin and
piano composed by Dr. Orchard, who
also conducted the Con. orchestra’s per-
formance of Wagnerian excerpts.
* * *
Adelaide Repertory has taken the
opportunity of showing two fine short
plays which came its way in a recent
prize competition. “Monday Morning,”
by G. L. Dann, of Brisbane, is stark
tragedy: the sheriff’s room in Sydney
gaol in 1828, with J. D. Lang and Father
Power both pleading—ineffectually—for
two innocent men who are being hanged
in a batch of six outside. Casual allusion
to a kangaroo hunt in Surry Hills is the
only relieving touch in the gloom.
“Heritage,” by an artistic Melbourne
woman who prefers to pass as “Susan
Gerard,” is a pleasant fantasy. An
elderly English aristocrat (well played by
Frank Gunnell) has to pick out the right-
ful heir from two young men ; and a
quiet maiden who mostly keeps in the
shadow comes out and talks to one of
them only. So he is the heir ; for it
appears at curtain-fall that she is the
family ghost. (Any amateur co. will
revel in this sentimental six-character
trifle.) A. A. Milne’s frivolous “Wurzel-
Flummery” completed a good bill, with
Arthur Fay (late of Melbourne) and Fred
James playing up to each other effec-
tively.
* * *
A Gregan McMahon season will open
on August 11 at Melbourne Garrick
with Shaw’s “Man and Superman.”
McMahon, usually first with the best,
presented this play several years ago
almost simultaneously with its London
premiere.


NORTH OF

“Kopina-Kava”: A correspondent is
puzzled to account for the death of
Arakawaia being known in Milne Bay
the day he was killed at Woodlark Island,
hundreds of miles away. 1 have heard
this story before to-day, and, like all the
others which try to prove that the native
has a “bush wireless,” it is incorrect. From
old official records I find that Arakawaia
was killed by a falling tree at Bonagai
(Woodlark Is.) on 5/117*09, and that
the news of his death was brought to
Samarai by the Merrie England on
28 /11 / ’O9, a day before his death was
known in Milne Bay. To say, or even
think, that the natives of New Guinea
have any more telepathic powers than
Europeans is absurd. I have made scores
of surprise visits in many of the hostile
corners of Papua ; I have gone up the big
rivers and across the high mountains
of the main cordillera looking for men,
but never once have I found the tribes
warning their neighbors of my approach
other than by means of sound. If there
was no sound—even if the people had
seen us passing on the river or caught
us crossing a spur—it was always a com-
plete surprise.
* * * *
“X.N.”: Little Nauru has a record
which Australian Treasurers might envy.
Only once during the depression did it
have a slight deficit, and it has a sum
equal to 18 months’ revenue packed away
earning interest. There is no public
debt! Half its public income comes
from royalties on phosphate, and it is
administered at a cost of 5 p.c. of the
value of its exports. It is a law-abiding
spot in which a solitary European was
convicted during the year —for a breach
of a traffic regulation. Only four penal
offences are recorded for 1933, and
Chinese produced more than half the
misdemeanants, though the Nauruans
were active in such crimes as “drinking
sour ekarawe” and breaches of the peace.
Minor justice is administered by native
chiefs. Possibly the island’s freedom from
serious crime is due to general sobriety.
There were no convictions for drunken-
ness. A population, European, Chinese
and otherwise, of 2640 gets along with
7350 gallons of liquor (6300 beer) per
annum, or less than 3gals. per head.
Considering that it is packed into an
area of 8.43 sq. miles, and therefore must
be sociable, this is a notable performance
for the tropics.
* * * *
“Jerry”: A farmer at Goomeri (Q.),
pestered by kangaroos, caught one in
his garden-patch, and set out to give
it and its fellows a scare. Fetching an
old waistcoat from the lumber-room he
hung it on the ’roo in approved style,
making it secure with wire. Then he
let the animal go. Ten days later his
wife returned from Brisbane, and one of
the first things she did was to look for
the waistcoat, remarking that she had
safety-pinned £ll-odd in notes in one of
the pockets. But the ’roo had left the
district, no doubt feeling even more un-
lucky than its benefactor.
* * * *
“Ryan’s Well”: The road train which
the Commonwealth Government is test-
ing in Centralia is a success, though wear
and tear is heavy. When a juggernaut
with 28 tyres slumps over the sandhills
it settles down with something of a bump.
The road being sand, moreover, the
vehicle does not need a black-tracker to
follow its course, which is evident by a
couple of gutters just enough wider than
the track of an ordinary car to make
trouble for ordinary travellers. How-
ever, that can be simply mended. A
good fireplough run over the track occa-
sionally will save a lot of curses.
* * 4= *
“Millmerran”: Prickly-pear has appar-
ently made its last stand. The report
of the P.-P. Board issued by the Chair-
man of the Queensland Land Adminis-
tration Board that “complete victory is
now inevitable... .on all fronts pear has
been routed and its menace overcome”
sounds a fairy tale to those who saw it
17 or 18 years ago, so closly packed in
the country west of Chinchilla (Q.) that
animals sometimes died in its clutches.
The worst pear areas then looked like a
battle front —miles of rolling yellow
poison gas, miles of blasted land on
which the arsenious pentoxide had tem-
porarily killed everything living. When
the Cactoblastis was imported, 60,000,000
acres were infested in Queensland and
N. S. Wales, and the spread was so rapid
that it looked as if all the west not
closely settled would fall a prey to it.
Now, not only are 8,000,000 acres a year
being cleared, but it is assured that “re-
growth on cleared areas will be destroyed
completely.”
* * * *
“Jo”: When Constable J. R. Ward,
of the Thursday Island Water Police,
handed over six diminutive leper abos.
in Brisbane he must have heaved a sigh
of relief that his journey of 2000 miles
was over. He left T.I. nearly a month
ago on the 200-mile trip to Mapoon, in
the Gulf. There he picked up his charges
and set off on a nine-day journey to
Cairns in a small motor-launch. He had
a rough passage, with terrific gales and
mountainous seas which spun the trip
out to 18 days. The party then were
confined to the prison-van on a goods
train for four days. What with shunting
at every little siding all the way from
Cairns and preparing meals for the young
abos. on an old primus the constable
had a tough job.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: There is something ironic
in New Guinea trade statistics. The
Mandate has a sound credit balance of
exports. She sends out £1,581,000 worth
of goods—£933,ooo represented by gold
and £543,000 by copra—and imports
£912,000 worth. Australia sells her items
valued at £388,000 and buys £1,127,000
worth ; and the United Kingdom sells
£125,000 worth and buys goods for
£55,000. But the U.S.A., which was not
“Sorry, mister —forgot he was frightened of trains!”
anxious to see the Territory under Aus-
tralian rule, President Wilson fighting
W. M. Hughes for all he was worth, sells
£168,000 worth and buys £4780 worth on

Beachcomber : Lizard Passage
(B. 4/7/’34) wants to have a couple
more guesses when he says “Winds and
currents bring no flotsam to the Barrier
islands south of Cairns. In the Whit-
Sunday group and on islands further
north and south I can show “L.P.”
more flotsam than would build a house.
Further, I can-show him houses which,
apart from the roof, were built entirely
of drift timber. As for cocoanuts. I’d
undertake to pick up not less than 20
floating to every mile of beach on each
and every island. On Molle Island,
which is only a couple of miles square,
1 can show him hatch-covers front
America, china pots from Japan, cases
with French writing on them, glass balls
from the shark-net which was lost at
Coogee and bales of compressed hay
addressed to Malaya. After a good
tourist season any old thing at any time
is likely to come ashore here, from
pince-nez to beach pyjamas.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Quite a lot of English history is mixed up
with the careers of the debutantes who will
emerge from their cocoons at the Anzac Ball.
The father of Joan Greensill, a pretty child
with a mop of curly brown hair, is a cousin
of Lord Roberts (“Bobs”), and the family
home at New Farm, where elder sister Mrs.
Matthews looks after the younger members
thereof, is Kabul. Then there is Mary
O’Connor, whose great-grandmother and Lady
Stonehaven’s great-grandfather were sister
and brother and called the Duke of Manchester
“pa.” (The College of Heralds may wrestle
with the problem of what relation Mary and
Lady Stonehaven are to each other.)
Nearly £4O was raked in by the bridge party
held by the Anzac Ball committee to swell
the funds. The ball promises to be an even
bigger success than last year, which eclipsed all
previous efforts.
There are 1320 members of the Queensland
branch of the Australian Trained Nurses’
Association. A deficit of £27-odd for the year
shows that the depression is not quite over,
although things look rosier. Dr. Alex. Marks,
the retiring president, at the annual meeting
aired the problem of reconciling proper pay-
ment to trained nurses with the reduced capa-
city of the public to pay. Dr. R. G. Quinn
slips into the presidential chair. The Marks
home saw the meeting, and provided a cheery
setting for the garden party which followed.
Dr. and Mrs. W. W. Tilling and their son
spent a few days in Brisbane before leaving
for Nairobi. They go viat Japan. Mrs. Tilling
was Miss Harris, of Rockhampton. She has
been spending some months with her mother.
All the booksellers’ windows have imposing
arrays of “Landtakers,” Brian Penton’s book,
on view at the moment; so it was a happy
choice which sent Mrs. Brian Penton north to
renew old friendships at this moment. She
lived in Queensland before her marriage, and

During the first week in August, every night
is dancing time. The Debutantes’ Balt,
arranged by the Younger Set, will be held in
St. Andrew’s Parish Hall, Lutwyche. Lutwyche
Church of England has a lych gate and a
musical chime of bells —a war memorial.
Pamela Brown-Beresford is the president of
the ball committee, and sister Alethea is to
be a deb. Both girls are daughters of Rev.
J. H. Brown-Beresford, the rector.
Lady Isaacs is to be with us for Show
Week, although the G.-G. will not be able to
come north. Lieut. C. H. Finlay, A.D.C.,
and Miss Graham will be with her.
Billy Marwedel and Jean Alford were mar-
ried at St. Peter’s Church of England, South-
port, with Rev. R. Warner Shand, of Too-
woomba, to tie the knot, and F. C. Nicholson,
of Beaudesert, to give the bride away. Doris
Alford ’maided, and J. A. Yates (another
Toowoomba boy, and an old school friend of
the ’groom’s) was best» man. On Saturday the
Orungal carried the newly-weds to the North,
where their home will be. Fay Marwedel,
down from Toowoomba for the wedding, fare-
welled them on the wharf.
Helen Morrice, M.8.E., secretary of the
N.S.W. Bush Nursing Association, is staying
with her brother in Warwick. The lady left
Australia with the first hospital ship, and saw
almost continuous service through the war
near the front line. She owns a Roval Red
Cross. She has been secretary to the N.S.W.
Bush Nursing Association for 11 years, and
before the work got too strenuous was also
chief inspector and publicity officer. This is
her first visit to Queensland, and if there is
any one thing which she envies us it is our
aerial medical service.
Mrs. Frank Dalby Davison, her author
husband, and Dr. and Mrs. Brooke Nicholls,
are back from the North, delighted with then-
sojourn on Fraser and Green islands and
various other spots. The Davisons are staying
at Kangaroo Point for a few days before
packing their bags for home and Sydney.
Amy Smith, a relation of Lady Wilson,
will be a guest at Government House for Show
Week, and will lend a hand when Sir Leslie
holds his garden party early this month. Pat-
ricia Honnor, first welcomed as a sister of the
popular A.D.C., Captain T. P. Honnor, will
be with her. She made many , friends during
her last visit.
Chas. Ladd, just back from his honeymoon,
has heard that a London publisher will pub-
lish his travel book at the end of the year.
Ginger Meggs, Harold Larwood and Mae
West were at the Journalists’ Ball. Ginger
was there in color, Bancks having provided
a large and delightful drawing to help with
the decorations. The show was as bright as
ever, and the midnight newspaper, the “Ter-
rible Tabloid,” more unlikely than usual to
meet with the approval of Mr. Creswell
O’Reilly. Not an alcove was vacant, and the
distress fund should get a good lift when the
accounts are settled up.
An apologetic visitor from New South Wales
wandered into the Roma-street police station
the other day and diffidently mentioned that
he had just knocked over the war memorial
at Indooroopiily. About £5O worth of damage
was done, the memorial —which, by the way,
weighs about a ton —being pushed off its
foundations and the marble name-slabs badly
smashed. The motorist’s car also was con-
siderably knocked about, but the driver was
lucky that the memorial did not land on top
of him. The business was pure accident.
A visitor from Edinburgh, Miss Gibson
Craig, is spending the winter in Queensland.
The Victoria League welcomed her, with Mrs.
A. E. Moore as hostess. The lady has gone
north to see the Barron Falls and the Reef.
For 40 years Miss Overend Wilson, who is
deaf herself, has done splendid work for the
deaf and dumb. She is a very young 70
years of age. A life-size portrait of her has
been unveiled in the Deaf and Dumb Citizens’
Reformed Association rooms, when various
people spoke highly of her work.
Mrs. S. Conroy, who was one of the Wock-
ners of Jondaryan and who lives at Hankow,
in China, has arrived in Brisbane with her
sister, Myrtle Wockner, who has been spend-
ing a holiday with her. The girls are nieces
of Mrs. Bunny Nagle, and have their full share
of the Wockner good looks and flair for
dressing.
Esther Paterson, the black-and-white artist —
Mrs G. Herman Gill in private life —and her
husband (he is on the Melbourne “Star”)
will arrive in Brisbane about the middle of
August, and will spend several days at the
Stuarts’ cottage at Redcliffe. The three Stuart
girls are lifelong friends of the Patersons,
and seem to have provided Esther with a lot
of inspiration, as one or other of them usually
peeps out of her sketches.
There is a lot of excitement over the latest
engagement, between Dr. Peter Newton Mac-
gregor, son of our K.C. and Mrs. P. B.
Macgregor, and Margaret Bennett, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Bennett, of Warwick.
Dr. Peter takes after his mother’s .family in
looks —she was a Newton, a daughter of Dick
Newton, that handsome old gentleman who
was one of our pioneer pastoralists.
Lady Barraclough, of Sydney, is wintering
here, and Mrs. Lumley Hill’s daughters are
vying with each other to give her a good
time. Mrs. E. J. Watt has taken her up to
Belle Vue station, and when she comes back
Mrs. A. H. Whittingham will tuck her up in
the spare bedroom at Mayfield. Dinner and
bridge at the Whittingham home were staged
in the visitor’s honor.
Old friends all over Queensland tuned in
on July 30 to listen to the Empire broadcast,
in which mezzo-soprano Jessie King was taking
part. Jessie, who has been making a name
for herself overseas, is a daughter of Mr. E.
King, of Gowrie, and a sister of Mrs. John
Hardie, of Brisbane. The King family have
scores of relations all over the Downs, and
friends in every part of the Commonwealth.
Commander H. N. Montagu and his pretty
wife made a host of friends while their 44ft.
auxiliary yacht, The Vision of St. Anthony, was
lying in Garden Reach or pottering about the
bav. They left the water long enough to go
out to Rosevale station, to stay with the Edward
Hills. The night before leaving for the East
Indies, India and Europe they held a cocktail
party aboard the yacht. Captain Pat Honnor,
Commander J. C. McFarlane and a bunch of
others gathered to say “Good luck” and
“Come again.”
Hardly had the Vision departed than the
Mystery, ketch-rigged and manned entirely by
Henry Stratton-Brown, who, incidentally, is
his own shipbuilder —it took six months to
put the Mystery together—dropped anchor in
the Garden Reach. Henry owns a rubber plan-
tation in Malaya.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER.
The Moore Park Golf Club Ball was
one of the successes of the week. Maroon
and gold, the club’s colors, in flowers
and balloons brightened up the tables.
But only the A. Brown couple attempted
any characteristic decorations. They had
floral golf-sticks standing at each end of
what at first sight appeared to be a
bunker down the middle of their table,
but on closer inspection turned out to be
the name of the club done in reddish
and gold flowers. A party was enter-
tained by the T. Hickeys—he’s the cap-
tain. Her frock was of mauve velvet with
a deep-violet velvet coat. President F.
Walsh brought his wife, in black laces, and
daughter Mollie, in field-flower-patterned
crepes. In this group were Sylvia Haig,
in floral satins, the Ken Morris couple
and the John Dows. Japanese members
brought their wives in picturesque
national costumes with the very long
formal kimono sleeves. One had a pale-
gold ground, patterned in deeper shades,
the sleeves showing scarlet linings.
Another was of black, with huge chry-
santhemums outlined in gold and silver
thread.
Among the pointed-outs at the All-
Australian Aeroplane Ball were pilot
Donald Savill and the designer and
builder of the ’plane for the centenary
race, T. D. J. Leech. He presented the
organiser, Mrs. Carla Jaques, with a
high-handled basket of scarlet arum
lilies, which looked very effective against
her black laces and black ostrich-feather
cape. Mrs. Leech’s chiffons were black ;
so were Mrs. Eric Shellar’s trained
velvets. Jocelyn Poynter’s gloves wore
frills on their gauntlets, Claudia Beaz-
ley’s parchment satins a pink and blue
pattern, and Barbara Dare was joyous
above blackberry laces.
The walls of the Wentworth sprouted
model aeroplanes, balloons and flowers.
Josephine Marks made £l2 on a guess-
ing competition for which the prize was
a well-filled hamper. Eddy Samuels
showed a catholicity of taste in his pro-
gramme of events; Mina Shelley’s
aeroplane ballet was as full of movement
as a bird on the wing. Hon. sec. Owen
Dibbs smiled on the success of the night,
and when the Wentworth put up its
shutters a party of young people found
their way to the Barracks for a half-hour
chat before turning the noses of their
cars homeward.
Geoffrey and Mrs. A. R. Lempriere’s
ale and sherry party at 169 Macquarie-
street was the bright spot in a week grey
socially as well as atmospherically. This
house, one of those slim, old-fashioned
places, has three steps leading to its
front door. Inside there’s a winding
stairway ; at its foot more rooms, more
stairs and a hall. The reception-rooms
have cream walls and ceilings, both
inlaid with a futuristic design in copper,
and the lighting is of the modern strip
type. Mollie Street was one of the many
who helped themselves to savories from
the three-tier semicircular sideboard.
Others among the sixty-odd guests were
Janet Knox and her fiance Julian Simp-
son, Barbara and Patsy Dangar, Barbara
Warry, the Ven Wesches, Leslie Stephen
and the Ken Winchcombes.
Elizabeth Friend was the first society
bride of last week. She kept her appoint-
ment with Tim (christened Walter
Robert) Whitney at St. 'John’s, Darling-
hurst, where her mother and father
had been married. Faintly pink arum
lilies (tinted, not gilded), tied with
apple-green ribbons, bloomed on pew
and pillars, and toned in with the
almond-pink-blossom chiffons of the six
bridesmaids and their unusual bouquets
of crotolaria and mignonette. Three small
flower-girls, in white ninon frocks, had
their hands brimming over with green
leaves and wore chaplets of them in
their hair ; Jann Crossing was so small
and the afternoon was so wet that she
had to be carried into the church. The
bride’s sheath of thick white crepe crept
into a train, over which floated a misty
lace veil, held in place by a coronet of
orange buds, and trails escaping from the
loose cluster in her hands fell to the hem
of her skirt. Toasts were drunk at
Wirian, the home of the bride’s parents,
where Mrs. Friend, sustained by the
beauty of brown-patterned cloth of
silver, greeted 300 guests.
For presents there were cheques and
paintings, crystal and books. Una Clift’s
gift, a solid tea-and-coffee set, over 100
years old, no woman could look on with-
out being guilty of the sin of envy.
Of special interest to Bulletin readers
is the subject of this pencil portrait—
Edith Haynes, daughter of John Haynes,
who, with Archibald, founded the pink-
covered paper. To many he" was known
as “Mudgee” Haynes, as he represented
that district in Parliament for many
years. Since her parents died Edith has
made her home with her aunt and uncle,
the W. M. Hughes couple, but shortly
she will marry Dudley Evans, of Uralla,
son of the Robert Evanses of Armidale.
The ring is a gorgeous affair of emeralds
and diamonds.
Word comes that Nancy Bavin will
be married in England on Saturday to
her Laurence Harry Milner Gulland.
The ceremony will take place at the pic-
turesque old village church at Churt and
the reception at Churt Acres, the home
of her sister and brother-in-law, Com-
mander J. Horn. A feature of the wed-
ding veil will be the panels of beautiful
old Italian lace, which were worn by
the bridegroom’s mother at her wedding.
Cousin Dorothy Parker (she’s the
daughter of W. A. Parker, Master in
Equity), who is studying French at the
Paris Uni., will be one of the ’maids ;
the other is Joan Eden, who stayed with
the Games last year. The wedding is to
be a quiet one, as Nancy says she
couldn’t bear a big one when her mother
and father could not be there. But the
wedding trip includes a visit to Aus-
tralia, so it won’t be long before they
will make the acquaintance of their new
son-in-law.
When Maureen Ahern invited four of
her friends, Celia Bagley, Olive Fanning,
Ellie Roberts and Pauline Boland, to
motor down with her to Sydney while
she had a look round for some trousseau
accessories, she had no intention of get-
ting married before her return. When
they reached Sydney, Maureen thought
she might as well take a run up to Can-
berra to see her fiance. All the parties
planned by friends here to brighten the
girls’ holiday had to take place without
the guest of honor. Even Mrs. Toby
Brown's on Thursday last found
Maureen missing. However, on Friday
morning she arrived, plus wedding ring
and wedding lines, ready to motor her
friends back to Brisbane. Barney J.
Anderson (he’s the Federal politics re-
porter for Melbourne “Herald” and
Brisbane “Courier”) had persuaded her
to marry him straightway instead of
waiting until September. So they slipped
around to the church, and Father Hay-
don tied the knot. Two Inkywayfarer
friends of the ’groom were witnesses. In
about a fortnight Maureen will pass
through Sydney again, pick up her hus-
band, and the two of them will turn their
faces toward their home in Melbourne.
Brigadier-General O. F. Phillips and
his wife have left for Melbourne, where
they will make their home now he is
Quartermaster-General. Ever since news
of his appointment came out this popu-
lar couple have been eating meals of
farewell. Last week the military hosted
most of the parties. On Friday he was
the guest of the
officers at dinner.
On Wed n e sday
there was a party
for both at Vic-
toria Barracks.
Some of the mess
plate held white
and golden pop-
pies ; royal blue
and scarlet deco-
rated the tables,
and outside the
R.A.A. band
cheered a grey
afternoon. Mrs.
Phillips wore black,
and in the presen-
tation posy were red
carnations, white
sweet - peas and
blue cornflowers.
The mess president,
Major H. W. C.
Macbride, and his
wife received the
guests, among
whom were the
Col. J. D. Lavarack
couple (he’s Com-
mandant of the
Royal Military Col-
lege), Major and
Mrs. T. Vasey, just
on the point of
leaving for two
years in India, and
Mrs. D. A. Hall
and her captain,
who also leave for Melbourne this week.
The rain didn’t take any of the curl out
of the United Service Institution’s fare-
well dance for Brig.-Gen. O. F. Phillips
and his wife. The rooms were glitter-
some and colorful with the decorations
and uniforms of the navy and the army,
and the women kept their escorts in
countenance by wearing their best
raiment. The new president, Brigadier
A. J. Mills, and his wife greeted all
comers. Her frock was fashioned of the
new stiffish black net. Mrs. Phillips wore
myrtle-green crepes, with green flowers
blooming down the front of the skirt.
Mrs. P. J. Manly brought to the party
her captain husband, as well as black
satins garnished with tiny lace frills and
high-standing lace sleeves. Mrs. H. J.
Feakes, who came with the Rear-
Admiral, wrapped her slimness in bur-
gundy laces. The rest of the gay com-
pany was made up of all of Who’s Who
in Sydney naval and military circles.
Nothing could have given Sarah Hynes
more joy than the hanging of John Long-
staff’s portrait of Mrs. Ellis Rowan, to-
gether with 10 of Mrs. Rowan’s paint-
ings, in the library of Federal Parlia-
ment House. Miss Hynes (she was the
organiser of the movement) calls this a
national portrait, as the people of Aus-
tralia subscribed the 300 guineas pur-
chase money. If it hadn’t been for her
determination to have her friend’s work
recognised in her own land, that won-
derful collection of paintings of Aus-
tralia’s flowers, trees and landscapes
would have found a place in some other
country’s treasure house.
Anyone in doubt as to the attractive-
ness of the coolie hat has only to see
Madge Elliott in it to have all doubts
removed. She wears one in her first
appearance in “Gay Divorce” with a
green ensemble that will be the envy of
every blonde in Sydney. Dressed for the
beach in the second act she wears a
white crepe wrap-around skirt. This is
fastened at the left side with scarlet
ribbons threaded through three or four
of the new chromium-ring fasteners,
whence it falls free, revealing at every
step the scarlet shorts beneath. Her hat
is of outsize dimensions, banded in
scarlet and with two crossed bands for
a crown. The background in the 'third
act, showing moonlight on the water, is
an admirable foil for her sheath of cloth
of silver and luscious blue ostrich-
feather wrap, and later for an accordion-
pleated grey and pink neglige. Not to
be passed over is the black velvet coat
and skirt with its three silver foxes, one
twisted around each sleeve and one
around the shoulder, of Madge Aubery,
which she says represents the three hus-
bands she got rid of in the mazes of the
Divorce Court.
All “The Wind and the Rain” cast
turned up to the dress rehearsal, and
picked out in the murk of the shrouded
theatre were Nan Taylor, clutching her
squirrel cape about her, Joyce Howarth
and George Thirl well. All chuckled at
the jokes, admired the finished dancing
of Madge and Cyril, cast an appraising
eye on the dressing of the principals,
and on the lack of it on the girls in the
bathing-suit ballet.
The Mayoral lady is staging a fashion
parade in the vestibule of the civic fast-
ness on Thursday and Friday. This will
be the first chance the public will have
of seeing the new spring frocks. The
girl who is thinking of matrimony next
year is advised to bring book and pencil,
for in the frocks of the 1935 bride and
her ’maids she will find something to
make notes about. To the damsel who
hopes to get to some of the dances dur-
ing royalty’s visit the semi-floral court
dresses to be worn by six debs, and a
matron will prove the most absorbing.
A florin will bring you to all these de-
lights, with tea and music added for
good measure. Gate-money goes to the
Mayoress’s Clothing Fund.
When Mary McMahon went off with
her ballet shoes to try her luck at the
examination of the Association of
Operatic Dancing of Great Britain, she
didn’t realise how far-reaching the
results would be. Mary entered for the
elementary, intermediate and advanced at
the same time (an almost unheard of
proceeding), and got her diploma. She’s
the first Australian girl and the first girl
entirely trained in Australia to get this
distinction. The quality of her work
awakened the association’s eyes to the
advisability of holding examinations in
Australia, and Frances Scully, Mary’s
teacher, has received a cable appointing
her organiser for N.S.W. and Queens-
land for the first of these, which will be
held next year. Felix Demery, the man
whose lynx eyes the dancers will need
to satisfy, leaves England early in 1935.
The association, founded 20 years
ago by Espinosa, has Queen Mary for
its patron and Madame Genee for its
president.
St. Vincent’s Hospital Ball netted £320,
and a cheque for this amount was
handed to the Mother Rectress on
Thursday afternoon. Mrs. G. E. Flan-
nery, president of the ball, made the
presentation, after which she. and mem-
bers of the committee, including the
Hughes lady, Mrs. Odillo Maher and
Mrs. Hatfield, were the guests of the
Mother Rectress at afternoon-tea.
On Wednesday Mrs. T. H. Kelly
handed over a cheque for £275, the pro-
ceeds from the “Collits’ Inn” Ball, to
knight Henry Braddon, president of the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital.

With a burst of oratory in Italian, fol-
lowed closely by “What’s good for the
goose is good for the gander,” the
Italian Ball was launched in the Town
Hall. Guests paused at the bazaar to
watch the spinning glass wheel and
wonder what it contained for them —a
whole sheep, an order for a new suit or
evening dress, a bottle of wine, spaghetti,
babies’ woollies, a tin mug, a sucking-
pig, or a blank which meant nothing at
all. There was far more English than
Italian in the babble of talk, and kegs
of beer, not wine, were the night’s liquid
refreshment. Long supper-tables in the
lower hall carried myrtle and Iceland
poppies and tall bowls filled with
oranges. But for olives and spaghetti
the fare was all Australian.
The Lady Mayoress, wearing lacquer-
red chiffon with a lame cape accessory,
was presented with a bouquet of crim-
son roses tied with the Italian colors by
Mrs. Santoro, whose blue brocade dress
with its cowl-draped corsage crept into
a suggestion of train. Mrs. Speirani’s black
velvet coat was swathed over black lace.
Proceeds of the dance, which is an
annual affair, went to the Lord Mayor’s
Fund.
Costumes at the Vic. Artists’ “Gay
’Nineties” Ball overlapped well into 1934
with an overwhelming Mae West. Sec.
Harry Fern, whose costume mysteriously
disappeared when he was decorating the
supper-tables, dabbed a paintbrush wildly
over some calico, made a lock of hair
out of straw and colored his nose a ripe
tomato. A pair of sailors were Arthur
Bell, in baggy white slacks and a chest
decorated with mermaids, and his little
brunette wife, who was gay ’ninetyish
with leg-of-mutton sleeves in her middy
jumper. Douglas Maclurkin didn’t go
north of the Tweed for his inspiration ;
he was a merry coster in bone buttons,
jersey and picturesque headgear. His
coster-girl partner wore sweeping feathers
and black-and-white check gingham.
Sam Atyeo’s chalk figures scampered
round the galleries with drooping mous-
taches, straw deckers and modest bath-
ing suits whose stove-pipe legs hid
knobby knees. Some pedalled bicycles,
and a fierce-looking pair were peeling off
ready for a fight.
The supper-tables were decorated with
cauliflowers, fresh from the market
garden, radishes, split and stuck into
bottles, crayfish, pineapples and prawns,
prunes and peanuts (these last could be
eaten or used as ammunition to pelt the
next table). Some time in the morning
a shoot was rigged up over the stairs ;
the exercise is good for the digestion,
and it ensures new costumes for the next
Artists’ Ball.
Geelong C. of E. Girls’ Grammar
School held an old girls’ reunion at
Tudor Court, Caulfield, amongst the
school colors in blue-and-gold wall
draperies, bowls and irises, violets and
marigolds and clumps of golden wattle.
In a green garment old girls’ president
Marjorie Minifie showed a glitter of
gold lining to her cape when she raised
her hand to welcome the guests. Head-
mistress Miss A. Peterson carried her
presentation bouquet of bronze and gold
pansies against an oyster satin gown.
Mrs. Frank Bamber was pursued by a
snaky-green train ; Mrs. Jim Howard also
had an elongated skirt to keep an eye
on, its material figured crepe de Chine.
Nan Stewart slid into a sheath of
oleander-pink satin; Mrs. John Niall’s
smoke-grey chiffons merged into a rose-
red design; Mrs. J. L. Randell’s black
gown had a frisk of green ruching upon
its shoulder draperies, and a motion-
forward effect was derived from the
bustle on Betty Hornabrook’s ciel-blue
satin. Blazing log fires in the reception-
rooms kept old girls and their partners
warm.
Percy Frankenberg blames Dr. J. E.
Niall for plunging him into a ladies’
afternoon at the International Club ; Dr.
Niall blames his glasses when he read
the invitation, for until Mrs. Latham
only was introduced he’d expected the
moral support of a speech from the
Federal Attorney-General. V. F. Riddle
was another man present (brought by
his wife). He’s an Aberdonian, and was
in the Union Bank in Melbourne for
many years. He and Mrs. Riddle now
spend their time in travel. They have
no home, but their storage bills are
mounting, for they are curio-hunters.
Mrs. Latham's sense of humor per-
meated her informal address. The sloe-
eyed, straight-haired baby of the Orient
has completely stolen her affections —
one little Japanese aged 15 months whom
she met on her trip was already being
taught to be polite, and could make a
wobbling attempt at a bow. Many
fashionable young women of China are
wearing their national robes with a slit
to the knee, much to the disgust of the
formal older generation. In Java there
were not enough Australian flags to be
waved for the Mission of Peace, so flag
designs were stained on cloth with batik.
Mrs. Latham was prepared to give her
impressions of baths in Java, but the
men’s presence daunted her, and she
saved them up for intimate conversa-
tion after tea.
The girl with her beret curled over
one ear, pictured here by Broothorn, is
Leseli Freedman, who is to be located in
a genuine and romantic attic in an old
building in East Melbourne. In char-
coal she has drawn nymphs, Greek gods
and mermaids curled up in bubbles all
over the sloping ceiling of her Bohemian
studio. Miss Freedman is interested in
modern development in art, and ex-
presses her individuality through clever
masks modelled from life and little
plaster figures which she calls “exer-
cises in balance.” She was a pupil of
George Bell and Arnold Shaw. Lately
she has taken a plunge into commer-
cialism by taking out a patent for a
ripple-vamp—a stick-on and pull-off-
with-petrol ornamentation for evening
shoes. Miss Freedman is Swiss by birth
and parentage and came to this country
in her childhood.
The event of the week was the open-
ing of “White Horse Inn” in the new His
Majesty’s, where every seat commands a
good view of the stage. A “weather
manufacturer” works through hidden
gratings under the chairs, the upholstery
is of ribbed brocade, pale green shot with
fawn, the carpets are deep red and of
luscious pile and the panelling of
Queensland walnut is inlaid with ebony,
black bean and oewter. Especially kind
to the complexion is the hidden lighting
system, which operates through rec-
tangular windows in the roof and walls.
The size and shape of the foyer below
are echoed in the lounge upstairs, all
pale-green walls, polished woodwork and
an arrangement of mirrors. The circle
boxes are built for couples or quartets,
the two people behind being high enough
to see over the heads of the pair in front.
On Saturday nobody seemed to want
to go home, though it was well after
11.30 p.m. when the stalls came up for
air from under a blanket of streamers.
The Firm’s celebration afterwards
packed the private reception-room, where
champagne and sandwiches were on the
bill of fare. Spotlights shoot from the
middle of the circle, and their covering
made a panelled balustrade most useful
for the disposal of v.-r. bouquets on the
opening night. The Tait family was well
represented: Betty, in spring-green
velvet, swathed her hair in the new notion
of a halo roll instead of a plait; Joan
was in blue and Peggy in orchid. Mrs.
Fred Dennett was ' outstanding in her
long black-currant wrap and a diamond
clip in her hair. Mrs. Norman Price
wore a squirrel coat and a twinkly hair-
band with her ice-blue satin dress, and
Mrs. Harry Best had cornflowers
wreathed round her Titian locks. Mrs.
Tronson’s fussy indigo taffetas were
sprayed with rectangular spots of silver-
grey, and Mrs. Boccard’s deep-violet
organza wore a square neck and a very
distinctive bustle. Afterthoughts of Mrs.
Bert Cowan’s white gown, with its low
decolletage in front, were demure straps
in the region of the wishbone. Among
others present were Dr. and Mrs. Roy
Chambers, the Ray Connollys, Mr. and
Mrs. Liston and the Percy Frankenbergs,
these last receiving congratulations on
becoming grandparents (the very new
daughter belongs to Dr. and Mrs. Officer
Browne).
The revolving stage operates only at
the finale, when the paddle-boat sails
round the lake to disclose woodland
scenes, Maypole dances and the Tyro-
lean troupe prancing on the mountain
top (it’s fortunate that their hefty smacks
are aimed only at their own skins). Inci-
dentals in the spectacular show are a
real shower of rain, in the background,
but near enough to give the right atmo-
sphere to the players skipping about
under umbrellas ; the cowshed scene all
in moonlight blue (the girls had little
blue muffs); the bathing scene, where the
ballet undulated first as a wave in mid-
ocean, then like a breaker tumbling on
the beach; Tyrolean socks and the
quaint cherry-colored hearts on the
backs of the ballet girls’ little white shorts,
worn under their swirling Tyrolean
dresses.
A plain and businesslike laundry
basket stood just inside the dining-room
at the Windsor for the musical afternoon
run by the Ladies’ Aid. By the time all
the guests had arrived the homely basket
was completely submerged, for each of
the 300 brought a parcel to replenish the
linen chests at the Homoeopathic Hos-
pital. It was a decided squash,
travelling between the tables being so
fraught with difficulties that most people
stayed in the same chair all the after-
noon. Mrs. H. S. K. Ward was presi-
dent, and Mrs. David Carnegie and Mrs.
J. Walker vice-presidents. There was an
orchestra, and Kiera Tuson (she’s the
saucy barmaid in “Mother of Pearl”)
contributed a snatch of comedy with
“I’m Wild About a Boy,” sung from the
point of view of a society girl, a Cock-
ney and a schoolchild.
Patients in the After Care Hospital had
some excitement on the afternoon of the
dedication of the Annie Dane ward, when
Mrs. Robert Hunter handed a cheque
for £5OO, a donation from her son-in-
law, John Stevenson Dane; to the presi-
dent, Mrs. G. G. Henderson. J. S. Dane
and his wife live in England. When they
were here last year and conceived the
idea of a centenary donation to one of
Melbourne’s institutions in memory of
Mr. Dane’s parents, Mrs. Hunter put in
an effective word for her pet movement,
the After Care. President-General of the
Methodist Church in Australia, Rev.
A. T. Holden, performed the dedication;
W. H. Edgar, a spray of daphne in his
buttonhole, did the formal christening,
and Archdeacon Hancock, representing
Archbishop Head, sprinkled a spice of
humor into his speech. In the official
group were the purple cape of Matron
Reynolds and the scarlet and blue capes
of the nurses.
An inspection of the building revealed
floors that are a temptation to dance
upon, and fires which burn every day in
the wards (such a comfort to weary
patients!). The women all wore their
bluest jackets; so did the small girls and
the babies ; the boys were in red. These
youngsters never get tired of the kinder-
garten friezes which run round the walls,
and there are playrooms for those well
enough to be interested in dolls’ houses
and rocking-horses.
Wearing the adventurous little hat is
Lorna Dawson, who will appear in the
demure dresses of Whimsy Drew in “The
Red Umbrella,” to be produced by Mrs.
Maie Hoban for the Un-named Players
on Saturday. Lorna is the eldest daugh-
ter of Dr. and Mrs. Dean Dawson, of
Adelaide. While in her home town she
studied drama and dancing, and enjoyed
her first taste of the stage with the Ab-
Intra Studio—a group which dabbles in
Japanese “No” plays, Strindberg and
Thornton Wilder. Since coming to Mel-
bourne she has tried her hand at broad-
casting and film acting with Efftee and
has joined up with the Little Theatre. At
present she’s immersed in preparations
for the Blue Triangle’s collecting cam-
paign. Portrait by Andre.
Prof. Copland and the students of
Commerce chose something more succu-
lent to bite upon at their at-home in
Tudor Court than the hard, dry facts
which they digest in lecture-rooms.
Standing beside her husband was Mrs.
Copland in a gown of Patou-pink faille,
sable pelts lying across her shoulders and
her fingers hidden in a presentation posy
of peach-blossom and roses. In a rustle
of black taffeta was Pauline Brosnan,
who, with D. J. Strang, had her hand on
the secretarial pen. Committee-women
were Helen McCulloch, with diminutive
black and green flowers growing upon
her off-white dress, and Isobel Crosbie,
in aquarelle blue. Associate-prof. Dr. G.
L. Wood brought his wife, clad in deep-
red georgette. Among other guests were
the H. Burtons, the J. G. Norris couple,
the O. Foenanders and the R. W. Mc-
Laurans.
Dr. Elinor Keam has returned to Mel-
bourne after several months spent in
study abroad.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Our new Governor, Sir Winston
Dugan, and his wife arrived in the
Orama on Saturday. Premier Butler and
Chief Secretary Ritchie met his Ex. at
the wharf, and after Mayor Bray, of
Port Adelaide, had read an address of
welcome they wafted the new arrivals
to Adelaide Town Hall, where Murray,
C.J., administered the oath. Sir Winston
then met the members of the Cabinet at
an Executive Council meeting, and at
night there was a Government House
levee at which all society was present.
Although the Lieut.-Governor and his
sister were only in office for the brief
period between the departure and arrjval
of oversea Governors, they never failed
to entertain, which was all the more
appreciated because the Hore-Ruthvens,
beyond a few strictly private dances,
did very little in that line.
For the Murrays’ last at-home, Gov-
ernment House reception-rooms were
decked with massed stocks, gladioli and
roses. In the ballroom, where afternoon-
tea was served, the tables were arranged
with pink sweet-peas, and the mantel-
pieces held banks of mauve malacoides.
His Ex. and Miss Murray received as the
guests were announced by Legh Winser.
The hostess wore black marocain and
a coat of black chiffon velvet, with a
black velvet hat. Premier Butler’s wife
wore a black tailored suit with a mink
fur and a black velvet hat, and the acting-
Mayoress (Mrs. H. Dunstan)had a squirrel
fur coat over her black silk frock. Mrs.
S. R. Symonds, wife of the Naval Com-
mander, provided a touch of color with
an apple-green toque ; her coat was a
black tailored cloth. A recent bride,
Mrs. Geoffrey de Crespigny, chose a
geranium-red ring velvet frodk, a hat to
match and a mink fur. The Sowden
lady’s leaf-browrt ensemble went with
a short marmot fur coat and a brown
straw hat. Mrs. K. Cameron. Wilson’s
pervenche-blue cloth coat had a grey fox
fur collar.
The A. R. Taylors staged their dance
at the Liberal Hall, where they enter-
tained about 100 of their daughter’s
friends. Balloons of every color were
festooned overhead, and mimosa, poin-
settias and almond blossoms were massed
along the stage. Downstairs in the Went-
worth, where supper was served, mixed
flowers were on the tables. Mrs. Taylor’s
pale-pink sand crepe was moulded to
the figure, merging into a train, with a
belt of diamente, and she wore a corsage
spray of white hyacinths. Daughter
Helen chose black ninon trimmed with
flounces of black lace, and a spray of
bright red, blue and yellow field flowers
worn at the waist and on the shoulder.
Haloes of natural flowers were much
worn, and velvet was in favor for frock-
ing.
The Methodist Ladies Old Scholars’
dance was at the Embassy, decked with
the college colors, red and white. Guests
were received by Mrs. Ross Anderson
and Misses Roxy Sims and Jean Harris.
The Palais Royal was the scene of the
Aero Club Ball. A miniature aeroplane
was suspended overhead. The official
party included president W. Murray
Fowler and his wife, the Legh Winsers,
Colonel and Mrs. D. V. J. Blake, the lan
Haywards and Mrs. and Mrs. Lemann.
Mary Lisle, eldest daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Lisle Johnson, of Prospect,
celebrated her 21st birthday with a cock-
tail party at which over 200 guests were
entertained. The young hostess sported
pervenche-blue ring velvet. Her health
was proposed by Justice Angas Parsons.
The Lacrosse Association provided
plenty of excitement at its ball at the
Palais Royal. Box lacrosse was played
by two teams of six, a soft ball being
used. Over 500 were present, and much
interest was taken in the voting for
queens. Jean Murray, representing
Goodwood, came first, Ruth Gellert
(East Torrens) second and Mrs. A. J.
Hanan (Sturt) third. The acting-Mayor-
ess, in scarlet chiffon, performed the
crowning ceremony, and was presented
by Mavis Tonkin, the convener, with a
bouquet of red roses ; Mrs. C. L. Abbott
(wife of the president) was the recipient
of a bunch of yellow blossoms which
gave relief to her black net frock.
About 200 were present at the Dental
Ball held in the Uni. refectory. Forceps,
huge toothbrushes and dental appliances
were featured round the walls. The
president of the Dental Students’ Society
(Dr. C. B. Maddern) and his wife re-
ceived the guests, she in a modish gown
of woodland-green sand crepe, closely
fitting and merging into a long train.
Dr. Ray Newling’s wife set off her fair-
ness with pale-pink satin.
WESTRALIA.
Y.A.L. officers started their ball roll-
ing with a fanfare of trumpets and a
roll of kettledrums, and there was a cook-
house call at suppertime. The stuffed
’roo which had landed on the piano was
at home among garnishings of wattle
and Geraldton wax, and the sunny
league colors were festooned overhead.
Mrs. W. H. Taylor watched the trick
cycling in sea-blue craquelle ; Joan Too-
good unfurled white wings from black
velvet plumage; the Baker twins,
Dorothy and Beatrice, were chipped From
the same coral reef; Mrs. K. Bantock
was garbed in gold lame ; Dorothy Jack-
son’s tulles were the pink of icing;
Eunice Kalish rippled a surface of
sequins over a pool of black velvet, and
Mrs. Angwin’s blue chenille was
sprinkled with largesse.
Commodore Lamb launched the Royal
Perth Yacht Club’s dance. Chinese lan-
terns reflected their rainbow hues in the
waters on the port side, and to starboard
there was an awning of bunting. Mrs.
Lamb’s foam-sprayed blue canvas led the
tack to supper, which was moored in the
billiard-room, closely followed by the
velvety ripples of Mrs. Felix Levinson’s
sea blues ; Mrs. J. A. Dimmit plumbed
the depths of violet lace; a wave of pink
lace flowed over Mrs. Kitching’s sheet
of silver; Mrs. Max Rutter’s marine
satins were windswept; Dorothy Howe
twinkled in evening-star lame, and Ailsa
Carcary was a froth of white.
Barrie’s “What Every Woman Knows”
found the Rep. Theatre wi’ a fu’ hoose
for three nichts. There was a hame in
every heart for Gwen Bickford’s bonnie
playing of Maggie, and a verra warm
place for Bill Darbyshire’s David. Mollie
Learmonth’s Comtesse de la Briere
cheered the cockles, and the thistle
wreath went to Gerald Ruse for produc-
tion.
Uni. students forsook the halls of learn-
ing for the Embassy to dance at the
Newman Ball. Dr. Prendiville and
knight John Kirwan were piloted to
guest-of-honor pews by pr. J. T. Mc-
Mahon. Chaplain of the society Joan
McKenna, in gardenia satins, and
Dorothy Tagney, in ebony velvets, were
the vice-presidents. Noreen McKinley
swung a length of secretarial apricot
matelasse, and Kath Mulcahy’s roseate
pinks were associated with the coffers.
Pat Kinane traced spring leaves on her
snowy taffetas ; Occie Grave combined
black satin with beige lace ; Mrs. Tom
Ahearn’s georgettes were in ripe mul-
berry, and Madame Gelle chattered
above tomato lace.
Mrs. E. B. Sinclair, kilted into autumn-
leaf plaids, put on a tea and competition
afternoon at the mayoral reception-
rooms. Daughter Marjorie, in lemon
wool repp and snug astrakhan scarf and
biretta, handed round teacups.
Prof, and Mrs. Murdoch, with daugh-
ter Ann, were welcomed on their return
from England at a party given by Dr.
and Mrs. Maurice Johnson in their West
Perth home.
Claremont Toe H culled coins from
the bridge party arranged by Mrs.
Donald Tregonning at the Embassy. The
lady’s sailor hat topped a suit of beach
sand wool de Chine and peeped above
a wealth of red and cream roses on the
tables.
Mt. Lawley golfers left the fairways
to dance in the lounges at the club hop.
Mrs. Harry Glick swapped merry chain
partners in black lace with a deep cream
berthe; Ann Glick’s floral blues were
found in the hunt dance, and Mrs.
Donald had black fisher net over her
satin.
TASMANIA.
The opening of Parliament becomes
less ceremonious year by year. His Ex.
was not present at the last, having com-
missioned the President of the Legisla-
tive Council to do the job, which was
briefly accomplished.
His Ex. and Lady Clark took them-
selves to Launceston and treated a crowd
of Guides and Scouts and their officers
to an afternoon at the talkies, followed
by tea at the Brisbane Hotel. Host and
hostess appeared tc enjoy the proceedings
as much as their guests did.
Capt. F. Marriott, M.H.A., was bidden
to Government House for his investiture
with a C.M.G. at the hands of his Ex.
It was a cordial little ceremony. Every-
body felt in sympathy with the recipient,
who, although blinded in the war, has
never let his disability get in the way of
his Parliamentary and philanthropic
activities. Capt. Marriott’s wife and son
John were there, and knight Elliott Lewis
and his lady, the Mayor of Hobart and
a bunch of Parliamentary and society
folk were spectators.

Members of St. John’s Church, Laun-
ceston, are arranging a show to cele-
brate the Batman centenary. The church
grounds are to be turned into a scene
of 100 years ago, some of the original
shop signs will appear on replicas of the
original buildings and the shade of Sir
George Arthur will drive up in the old
State carriage and hold a reception ot
citizens dressed in period costumes.

CHAINS, SHOPS AND CO-OPS.
Still they come, the people who want
to take part in this argument. “Brass
Tacks” has the floor first:
I had not intended to pursue this subject,
but some of “Tock-locks remarks ( •
18/7/’34) call for reply. His reference to the
reluctance of wholesalers to take up new lines
may be right, but a friend of mine who should
know tells me that this has become m 9 re
marked through some manufacturers placing
lines with them and then supplymg chains at
the same price or lower. He adds that he
finds it even more difficult to sell to chains
except at a price which will admit of then
undercutting the ordinary retailer, if they feel

than talc or shaving soap) that the store would
show a much higher average per head.
So chain-store girls don t become due foi the
sack? Maybe not, but the last time I adver-
tised for an assistant five out of the seventeen
applicants had been chain-store girls.
“Tock-Tock” doesn't dispute my figures re-
garding profits, so I’ll give him a few more.
A thousand Sydney grocers agreed at a meet-
ing that 20 p.c. would be a fair thing. it
is more than they have been getting andl con-
siderably less than one chain has admitted
making. Another has been paying up to 30 p.c.
divs., and is issuing bonus shares. It
is the cost of service that counts, and, judg-
ing from these facts, the httle fellow isn t as
hungry as his big brother. If the bite isn t
taken out of staff or customers, it must come
out of producers. .. , _

gained at first hand u I don’t believe that my
experience as branch-manager really helped in
any success I have had as a retailer I h
developed my business on lines which re-
quired the use of qualities other than money
power. And I certainly would not regard
chain-store sales experience as a worth-while
asset to an applicant when choosing assist-
ants.
“The Mugwump”: “Tock-Tock’s” references
to the British Co-ops. are ridiculous. Smalt
towns and villages,” is it? The Co-op. move-
ment began in Lancashire, and there is not a
town of any size in the country w bere the
Co-op. doesn’t do the major business oft its
own P bat. For example, in Preston (pop.
120,000) the Co-op. has 75 large branches,
fully stocked. The Co-op. doctor—a paid
official—will bring you into the woriffi and
the Co-op. undertaker will bury you. lhere
are Co-op. dentists, opticians and
masters. And obviously ‘Tock-To<& never
wandered into the C.W.S. offices in
Balloon-street, Manchester. This society deals
only with Co-ops in the retail business it
runs its own packing-houses, boot factories,
coalmines, lines of steamers and tea planta-
tions As far as industrial Lancashire is con-
oernecl, the Co-ops. make the Maypole Dam
Co., Lipton’s or any other chain look like
a corner grocery store.
“Mallee Hen”: The Great Australian Boom
is over, and there are far too many shops.
Chains are doing a national service by knock-
ing out the inefficients. _ Our Vic. country
town was notorious for its “hot prices unt
chains came in; then prices collapsed with
a wallop, and three storekeepers who should
never have been there put up their gutters.
The rest, after overhauling their business
methods, came up smiling; one trader said
chains had actually improved his business by
bringing new customers to the town. Another
chain man in the town, who deals in cvcpfbing
from hardware to drapery, sells at the same
price in all his shops, whether in a Melbourne
suburb or 400 miles out.
“Cosmos”: A London paper points out that,
though only 10 per cent, of Britain s 500,000
retail shops consists of chains of one kind or
another, “that 10 per cent, does nearly half the
retail trade of the country. It is much the
same in France, the US.A. and elsewhere.
The Co-ops. came into their own after the
war, when everybody had plenty of cash tor a
time. Goods are not necessarily cheap in a
Co-op.—they are often dearer than in the one-
hand establishment over the way—but they are
usually good. With the depression millions,
including Co.-op. members, began turning to
the one-price cash-and-carry establishments, in
which some lines are conspicuously cheap.
But when buyers wanted the best they re-
verted to the Co-ops. and the great depart-
ment stores. , , ~ , .
Suppose the Browns of Clapham decided to
invite some friends to dinner. They would
get the chickens, sausages, butter, cheese, etc.,
from a local multiple (probably Samsbury s);
the groceries from the nearest Co-op.; the
flowers, sweets and cigarettes from good in-
dependent shops, and Mr. Brown might get
the drinks from the wine-counter of a city
department store like Harrod’s.
Each business fulfils a useful purpose by pro-
viding some kind of specialised service. Sains-
bury’s is an interesting example. It was
started at the end of last century by a couple
in an East End ham-and-beef shop. There arc
branches now in every London suburb and in
most parts of England. Sainsbury’s goods are
far from cheap; they sell on their quality.
It would be a calamity to some sections of
the British public if any of these concerns
were hamstrung by extra taxation or other-
wise. Similarly, it would be a calamity if any
considerable proportion of Britain’s 450,000
small traders were put out of business. There,
as here, the small trader is a necessity. His
family-controlled business may be uneconomic
in an accountancy sense, his stock may be
small and his prices high, but there are occa-
sions in which he is as welcome as a port in
a storm. .
In only one event, as I look at it, would
Parliament be justified in legislating to the
detriment of a business, and that is when the
business threatens to operate to the detriment
of the public. So long as the only offence
of a concern is that it brings prices down to
the public, so long should the public which
is benefited by its actions refrain from ham-
pering it. Other aspects of its activities
(Sunday and after-hours’ trading; the employ-
ment of juniors who are sacked when they
grow up; the habit of displaying shoddy goods)
concern only sections of the population and
should be dealt with, if at all, by the sectional
organisations affected.

Read These Splendid Reviews!
“SYDNEY MORNING HERALD.”
“Those who want to keep in touch
with the best in current Australian
fiction should read LANDTAKERS.
It is based upon a theory relating
to Australia’s pioneers, and their
influence on later generations, which
may well annoy red-hot patriots
the author has something new to
say as fine a tale of Australian
pioneering as has appeared for many
a long day .... One must mention,
too, the vivid, realistic scenes out of
which the author has built up his
panorama of the pioneering epoch—
the triumphs, the catastrophes, the
day-to-day hardships, the loneliness
and isolation, the passionate inter-
ludes, and so on. It would be diffi-
cult to recall a more dramatic, en-
lightening account of the opening
up of the continent. There are 500
pages, but not one too many.”
“THE SUN,” SYDNEY.
“Why should not the Common-
wealth, instead of wasting money on
trade commissioners, distribute abroad
copies of ‘Landtakers’? ... .a surer
defence than hosts of ambassadors
and trade commissioners.... Judged
as a novel it is a great story, the
best book of its kind yet written in
or on Australia. It is also a fine
study of the things that have gone
to the making of Australia.”
“COUNTRY LIFE.”
“We must appreciate Brian Penton’s
literary quality. The breath of life
he breathes into his characters, the
poetry of the terse, dramatic sen-
tences of which he constructs his
bush cameos Brian Penton will
be The Australian Novelist of whom
we shall be most proud. His know-
ledge of the bush is marvellous....
His sense of drama is unique.... An
Australian epic of the highest order.”
J. B. DALLEY WROTE:
“A feature of the book is the imagi-
native power and grim humor with
which what may be called the para-
noiacs have been handled.. . .here,
for the first time in literature, we
get their full-length pictures an
era is interpreted with knowledge
and without romanticism. This is the
achievement which puts LAND-
TAKERS ahead of all previous Aus-
tralian novels.”
“SUNDAY SUN,” SYDNEY.
“A real contribution to the fiction of
Australia.... A serious and com-
pelling story. Its incident is con-
vincing and its philosophy sound
Here is a story full of action and
character, in which the chief interest
is not the catalogue of gumleaves,
kookaburras and the clownish humor
of outback, but which has in it real
thought and real study of the people
who inhabit the book. It is Austra-
lian in the best sense; the land we
know and love is the setting for the
play of character Mr. Penton
takes his place at once in the top-
most rank of the Australian fiction-
writer.”

“It Pays Insurance Offices”
Income-tax assessments will be going
out from October onwards, with a month
allowed for payment. Why not send
them out now, with four months allowed
and instalments accepted if necessary? Jt
pays insurance offices to send renewal
notices out early, and it would pay the
income-tax folk.— C. H. Regelsen (Q.).
For Hospitals
I agree with your remarks on hospitals,
except your suggested method of financ-
ing them. I suggest a charity tax on all
sports and racing tickets. A large por-
tion of the Australian public will leave
the butcher and baker lamenting in order
to attend sports meetings ; these are the
people who will never contribute any-
thing for their treatment at a hospital.—

Let Her Go, Delano ! M
About the paragraph “Prosperity Ex-
press” on the Smoke-oh. page (B.
14/3/’34). Our train is on a single track.
A mile ahead of us three tracks converge
into the one upon which our train is
standing. A station agent ahead tele-
graphs that a heavily-laden freight train
has broken loose from its locomotive
and is tearing down the grade to us at the
rate of 65 miles an hour. In the excite-
ment he forgets to tell us which track
it is on, and his wires go dead. We can’t
back up. If we stay where we are we
will be crashed and many killed, for
there is no time to discharge' the pas-
sengers. We have one hope. Let’s go
forward and trust to luck that we
are on the right track to escape a wreck.
I think I can speak for the majority of
my countrymen in these sentiments. —

Pothunters and Trainees
Rifle clubs can be made worth while
as a training arm. I have been shoot-
ing with a match rifle since I was 16, and
the intensive training you get in youth
never deserts you ; at 42 I can still put an
occasional possible on the target.
When my battalion (a 3rd Div. unit)
was firing its musketry on Salisbury
Plain, using open sights and field condi-
tions, my score was far and away the best.
There were so many men in our section,
including the sergeant, who did not know
one end of a rifle from another that it
was arranged quietly for me to shoot for
them. We were congratulated by the
colonel, and narrowly escaped being
made into a sniping unit.
The point is that I was trained as a
lad, and in all our match competitions
we had a lot of service stuff, such as
firing at plates from unknown distances.
The club to which I belong now is in
a soldier-settlement area 240 miles from
Melbourne. The captain is an enthusiast
whose ambition is to see that every male
within reach knows something about a
rifle. The result is that we have a larger
membership than any other club in Aus-
tralia—even metropolitan clubs cannot
approach us. At the opening of an up-to-
date six-target range 150 marksmen com-
peted. We divided them into sections:
(1) pothunters, old hands who threw in
ten shillings or so for a sweepstake over
three ranges ; (2) youngsters, who used
military rifles and shot for silver spoons.
About 100 of our local youths shot in
(2) and were as keen as mustard. Noth-
ing disgusts a youngster more than to
find his Saturdays at the range costing
him good money as a benefit for some
old-stager.—P. T. B. (Vic.).
“A Semi-desert Land”
For over 20 years I have been pound-
ing Australian geography into the ears
of willing and unwilling listeners on the
Pacific coast; and now, to annul it all,
and brand me a d d Austraylean liar,
“McLean’s,” Canada’s “national maga-
zine,” comes out with the subjoined par.:
When 300 British settlers emigrated to
the State of Victoria nine years ago they
were full of hope that they would find
work and happiness away from over-
crowded England. The British Govern-
ment encouraged them and the State of
Victoria promised them land. But in Aus-
tralia’s north-western State they found
themselves in a semi-desert land where it
was impossible for most of them to scratch
a bare living out of the soil.
The “Literary Digest” published it
first; but our geography is so vague to
the average Canadian that the error was
reprinted and not even commented on.
When I try to burst the current theory
of Australian heat and aridity, and tell
the Canadian that in N.S.W. and Vic-
toria there are more acres under farms
per square mile than in British Columbia
all I get is “Oh, yeah?”
However, I suppose these ideas will
persist until either the schoolbooks here
are edited more accurately or Australia
votes a little more for geographical
export advertising.— Auscan (Canada).
Mrs. Digger’s Pension
Permit me, as a war pensioner, to
thank you for your articles, in the issues
of July 11 and July 18 concerning the
restoration of the cuts made in the pen-
sions of dependants.
Now about these dependants. I en-
listed in 1914, a single man, without a
care or responsibility in the world. I
took the first knock on the Peninsula,
and after various ups and downs got
another issue in 1918. As an incapaci-
tated soldier. I know I am entitled to a
pension, and I get one, have had it since
the day of my discharge, and will, I
expect, carry it until the Last Post. There
is an obligation on the Government,
which the Government is fulfilling.
Between T 4 and T 8 I got married ;
and I have never done a wiser thing. But
is there an obligation on the Govern-
ment to pay my wife a pension, and also
allow so much per week for each of our
children?
Make no error about it, we would go
without quite a lot if my wife were not
on the list. We draw her issue simply
because we could not afford to surrender
it. Not a bean of the pensions that come
our way is wasted, but, which I appre-
ciate the Government’s magnanimity, for
many years it has seemed to me that
there is no actual moral obligation to
pension my wife and children.
A. Laurence (B. 18/7/’34) is of the
opinion that a Digger taking on a long-
haired (or shingled) mate should have
her put on pension strength. I can’)
agree with him. Where is it all going to
end? If an old-age pensioner decides to
face the barrier, does he automatically
get his missus a pension?
I am not arguing from an economical
interest in the Government; any Gov-
ernment that can waste two or three
thousand quid on sending Parkhill on a
beano should be able to find the cash for
all Diggers, without putting the onus of
proof on the Digger that his incapacity
is due to war service. The point that
vexes me—and I. should like other
opinions—is whether there is a moral
obligation to pay pensions to wives, par-
ficularly those who became wives after
tb^. r Diggei husbands were discharged,

BRIDGE

BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
SOME BIDDING TACTICS.
In bridge a first-class rubber player is
not necessarily a good tournament
player. You may ask, if a man has
mastered all the conventions and has “card
sense,” what can militate against his
success at Howell match-points. Simply
the failure to recognise that ordinary
bidding for game and rubber, no matter
how accurate, must lose against experi-
enced match-point bidding. There are
differences almost to the extent of mak-
ing them two separate games.
Firstly, there is the element of sacri-
fice bidding. In rubber bridge one is
often driven into calling five diamonds
over four hearts to save the rubber, and
may feel justified if it is not too costly.
But in a Howell tournament this situa-
tion is constantly cropping up, and it is
imperative that a player should be able
to calculate from the bidding of both
partner and opponents what his actual
loss is likely to be. To a lesser degree
this obtains with regard to part scores.
If your opponents have bid to two
hearts, which will return them 180 points,
should you call three clubs? One down
doubled, not vulnerable, means a loss of
100. That would give your side a better
match-point; but what is your risk of
going down two? To weigh these
situations nicely you need an accurate
knowledge of the scoring, absolute pre-
cision in the partnership raises, and the
faculty of being able to read your
opponents. If, for instance, you think
they are more likely to go on with their
own suit than to double you, and you
have some defence against that suit, then
you can make your overbid with im-
punity.
The second important consideration is
the valuation of the suit bid against the
no-trump. In rubber play, if one holds
what looks like a game hand in a major
suit, the possibility of making the same
number of tricks in no-trumps is never
thought of. In Howell tournaments it
has to be taken into account. Four over
in a major returns 120 points ; in no-
trumps, 140. The risk of not making
the extra trick is worth taking, as a
rule, for three no-trumps, or 100 points,
won’t show a bad result.
Once the conclusion is arrived at that
careful no-trump bidding is a winner in
tournament play, one should compare
the teachings of P. Hal Sims with those
of Eli Culbertson. Mr. Sims has always
been a believer in the strong no-trump ;
I think, rightly. Mr. Culbertson used
to teach that an opening-no-trump, when
not vulnerable, might be bid on 2-1-
honor tricks, but he becomes much more
conservative in later editions of his Blue
Book. Another divergence is that
Simsites frequently open with one no-
trump, even when holding a five-card
biddable suit. The Culbertsonians
believe in more delicate approach
methods, and this is where they are
liable to fall down on their ultimate no-
trump contracts. There is a good deal
in Sims’s contention that the no-trump
is often played by the wrong hand. The
partnership may hold the actual strength,
but if North plays the hand it is almost
certain to fail on account of the lead
and the exposed dummy, while with
South as declarer the opponents are un-
likely to be able to pick the weakness.
There is a large number of strong
hands which should be reviewed care-
fully before opening with a suit bid. The
question is: “What is my next call if
my partner replies with one no-trump?”
Once the position is considered thus, it
frequently becomes evident that if no-
trumps is to be the final contract the
strong opening hand should be the de-
clarer. Not only for the reason that it
may possess tenaces, but because it is
always a good policy to conceal strength.
This method of placing the no-trump in
the more favorable position does not
absolutely commit the partners to that
contract. The responses to the strong
opening no-trump are well defined, and,
if it becomes obvious that the game will
be more safely attempted in a major
suit, that is the final declaration. There
are also “sign-off” bids at the level of
three which safeguard the partnership
against impossible contracts and large
penalties.
One complaint often levelled with some
ground against the Sims bidding methods
is that they make little provision for
slam bidding, and that when these are
attempted the process is quite haphazard
compared with Culbertson’s slam system.
The Sims bidder gives the impression of
battering his way up to the slam bid.
while others generally name three suits
before calling six, thus getting some idea
of the distribution in both hands. -
However, there is a reason for this
alleged weakness in the Sims system. Mr.
Sims is easily the most successful tourna
ment player under the Howell match-
point scoring in America. No doubt his
years of experience in hundreds of these
events have convinced him that slams
don’t pay. Some of us in Australia, with
only about seven months’ acquaintance
with tournaments, are coming to the same
opinion. Perusal of the scoring cards
at one’s leisure will reveal that the per-
centage of winning slams is not nearly
high enough to repay the loss of match
points sustained by the failures.
Nevertheless, there are a few types of
hands opposite an opening no-trump
which lend themselves to a slam bid by
careful methods. Here is one which is
not easy to arrive at except by a force
in a short minor suit. This short-suit
force is recommended by Culbertson,
with the understanding that the opening
no-trump bidder must reply with his
four-card major, if any, no matter how
weak.
The bidding undei this convention
then would go:
N. S.
INT 3D
3S 5S
6S
On the three-spade response South
knows the slam is in sight. If North
does not hold the trump ace, then he
has three quick tricks in hearts and
clubs. He would just like to be sure that
North can fill the diamond suit. As this
is so, six spades is the final bid. If
South, instead of using this conventional
force, bids two spades, or even three
spades, the contracting will almost cer-
tainly stop at four. There may be objec-
tions to the introduction of still another
convention in a game which has already
suffered so much from their use, but
anything which helps to eliminate guess-
work in arriving at high contracts is
surely to be welcomed.
Poddy- Dodgin’.
BY HENRY G. LAMOND.
FOR the best part of a week Colin
Tiblin and I had been riding
through the hills, poking up rough
gullies and gorges, not knowing exactly
where we were and caring less. We
sat at the campfire beside a bit of a
soak in a creek. Around us the hills
piled endlessly on edge. About us, in
the thick spinifex, wallaroos thumped
the ground in indignant protest at mere
men usurping their water.
With the rattle of displaced stones as
they walked, and the dry click of
their hooves as they approached, a mob
of cattle came to the water, noted our
presence, and passed on.
“Them things was worth money once,”
said Colin, nodding his head towards
the cattle stringing along their pad.
“They were worth four years in Dar-
win Gaol to one of those fellows in that
Lake Nash raid,” I added.
“He went looking for it,” Colin said
briefly. “A man that don't play the
game right can’t squeal if he gets caught.
Nine poddy-dodgers out of ten gets
caught the same way. What’s the
essence of the contract?”
“Time,” I said, having read it some-
where.
“Exactly,” Colin agreed. “If a success-
ful lifter don’t take his time, then he
does time. Those Frew fellows had
whips of time; they were a hundred
and fifty miles from Lake Nash ; they
ought to’ve weaned the calves and poked
’em up some channel till they forgot
their mothers. Then they could have
branded ’em. Instead of that, they stuck
their stamps on straight away. When
the police and the Lake Nash party
arrives, after following their tracks, there
was calves with strange brands sucking
Ul2 cows!
“They all make silly mistakes. Just as
well, too. If they didn’t, then honest
men like me and you couldn’t live. Some
people say honesty is the best policy. I
say honesty is a matter of policy.
“Take some of these big stations out
here. Do you reckon it’s honest on their
part to let yearling micks and heifers
run loose, tempting poor weak men like
us to put ’em in our pockets? It ain’t.
That’s what give the dodgers a start, and
that’s what kept ’em going. And it was
only by the frailty of human nature that
they defeated their own ends —the
poddy-dodgers, I mean. Instead of being
content with small profits and quick
returns they wanted big profits and
quicker returns.
“Some of ’em made money; some of ’em
made more ; and some made it for others.
I remember once —some time in TB, it
was —Joe Kildain, of Poolpee, got bitten
with the idea he’d get rich quicker if
he took his neighbor’s profits as well as
his own. Joe found out that Morney,
on Landale, had a mob of unbranded
calves running in his back country, and
he puts the proposition up to me —to me,
mind you!
“I had a bit of country leased the
other side of the Cartharbree Ranges. I
was making a pound or two and trying
to make each pound do the work of two.
1 agreed to lift them calves off Landale
for Joe at a quid a head delivered at the
Poolpee yards.
“I did, too. Lifted them cleanskin
micks while Morney was in town attend-
ing a meeting of the Prevention of
Cattle-stealing Association. They was
worth three quid a head in the open
market. While Joe was busy with his
branding-iron, laying a trap for himself
if they followed the tracks, and while
he was smiling at his astuteness in ex-
ploiting the working classes —me, in this
instance —I lifted nearly two hundred
Poolpee micks on my way back and
took ’em home with me. Squeal? Not
Joe! And I read a rattling fine speech
that Morney made at the meeting.
“The game’s right enough so long as
mugs don’t try and play a hand. When
they comes in that cruels the whole
show. They get caught; that casts sus-
picion on everybody ; that gives honest
men a bad name and breeds distrust:
besides which it lets the big pastoral com-
panies know how much they’re losing,
which is bad for them to know. The
directors squeal and ask awkward ques-
tions. That’s what the mugs bring about.
A good man works like a painless den-
tist—his patient never knows he’s been
under an operation.
“The first thing a poddy-dodger wants
jto do is to be a student of nature.
Human nature. He’s got to know the
ways of the men he’s likely to handle,
and he wants to know the sorts of re-
actions to expect from ’em.
‘'Remember Jerry Echlin? Jerry had
notions of growing into a poddy-dodger.
He thought he’d lift a mob off Pituri
Downs. He did. He took three or four
men with him—enough to lift a thousand
—and he came back with twenty—no ;
twenty-three.
“I knew the way he was likely to
bring ’em. I waited for him at the
mouth of the Cartharbree Gorge. There
was a half-moon rising, and Jerry and
his mob come riding along, thinking
they owned the world, just about mid-
night.
“‘Close in on them, men!’ I calls out
loud, riding out sudden in the moon-
light. ‘Don’t let any get away!’
“I suppose Jerry thinks to this day
that he had a lucky escape. I don’t
know the men what was with him, but
I daresay they still shiver when they
think of how the police nearly got ’em.
1 don’t know where they went, but the
pace they was going at when last I saw
’em would take ’em three times round
the Equator by the time I had that little
lot home on my place.
“But the main study is the nature of
the fellow you’re going to operate on.
If the dodger’s going to finish in the
bank instead of in the dock, he’s got to
know that man better than his brother
knows him. He’s got to know his weak-
nesses and his strength, his likes and
those who like him ; and he’s got to know
his methods of work and play. Further,
and mainly, he’s got to know just how
far that fellow’s going to go: whether
he’ll be content to let the case drop
after a while, or whether he’ll push it
right home.
“Some fellows, fussy fellows, are easy
to beat. A man can lift any sized mob
he likes. Say he takes a couple of
hundred. Very well. He takes that
number and he leaves about twenty on
his tracks. Fussy comes along. He
picks up the twenty. He judges the
dodger’s done just what he’d do him-
self : squibbed it and dropped his load.
He’s satisfied at that. He goes home,
thinking he’s wiped out the trouble. He
tells his wife and his children: ‘Those
poddy-dodgers don’t dare meddle with
me. They know I’m too quick on their
tracks. Take this case —the fellow got
frightened, knowing I was after him, and
ran away.’
“The hardest man of all to beat is the
artist—the one who makes a game of his
work and plays the game because he likes
playing it. That fellow feels his pride’s
been hurt and his reputation as a stock-
man’s injured if a man lifts any off him.
He ain’t going to squeal ; he ain’t going
to ask no aid from nobody ; he’s going
to cut that dodger , right where he lives,
and he’s going to show him which is the
smarter man of the two of ’em. It’s
going to be a duel between ’em, with the
dodger getting the worst of the deal.
“A poor but honest dodger what’s
working hard for his living hasn’t got the
time to spare to engage in no duels with
a fellow what likes duelling. If he does,
then his work suffers. If he neglects his
work, then his wife and children go
short. I lay it down as an axiom that
the artists should be left alone: they
go too far and they’ll come all the way.
“The first thing a man has to do, if
he’s going to do a decent job, is to
train himself to go without sleep. He
knows he’s going to go three, five to
seven days without a snatch of shut-eye.
And the way he learns to go without"
sleep is by doing without it! After a
week’s training a man should be able to
go on four hours’ sleep a day. After
a fortnight he should be able to take
it in cat-naps. While a fellow’s learn-;
ing to do without sleep he can do the
same with water: they both take about
the same amount of training. When he’s
set he knows he can go forty-eight hours
without sleep and nearly as long with-
out water. And without the angels of
luck flies with him all the way he’s
going to find both them habits useful
before he turns his poddies up some
pocket and takes off his boots.
“The next mistake the mugs make is
to get a mob near a waterhole. They
put on a camp there and cut out the
poddies. The cattle won’t work, being

Students now offer the
answer to thesepuzzling
questions: why
puppies eat mud;
why dogs' favour-
ite delicacy is a
bone. What we
have learned from
our four - legged
pets about fighting
tooth decay. What people must do
that dogs
do not.
An attractive smile must
depend on glistening, healthy
teeth. Many women forget
that fact until too late.
AS everyone knows, the wildest de-
light of any true epicure in the dog
world is a huge, juicy bone. After
the meat is eaten, the bone itself is
chewed and chewed, and that, in the
opinion of many people, is one reason
why dogs have good teeth. Bones are
mainly composed of calcium and phos-
phorus, the same minerals which build
strong, hard teeth. Many believe that
the dog’s appetite for bones is merely
nature’s scheme for obtaining the
minerals needed.
Human beings should include an
abundance of mineral-containing foods
in their diet also. Milk, cod liver oil,
and cheese are especially rich in tooth-
and bone-building minerals and the
necessary vitamins.
Of course, chewing hard substances
like bone also exercises the dog’s gums
and keeps them healthy and may offer
one more explanation of a dog’s freedom
from tooth decay.
The active cause of decay in the
human mouth, according to dental
authorities, is acid-producing bacteria.
These germs cause fermentation of the
food particles that remain on teeth and
under gums. In so doing, acids are
formed which start decay. The germs
which produce these acids live in the
coating of film which covers teeth. This

dog's diet contains

and vitamins.

film forms after every meal. It creeps
into every tiny crevice. Film actually
glues germs to the teeth. For years we
have studied ways of removing film.
Recently a discovery was made in The
Pepsodent Company’s laboratories—a
new and different cleansing and polish-
ing material. This new material is twice
as soft and therefore a great deal safer
than the polishing material generally
used in tooth pastes.
This new cleansing material is con-
tained in Pepsodent Tooth Paste exclu-
sively. Because it is softer and therefore
safer, Pepsodent is looked upon as the
modern standard of safety in tooth
pastes. At the same time it stands un-
surpassed in removing film and polishing
enamel brilliantly.

to gather 'em gradually without bustling
em. After a man’s had them in hand
six or eight hours, driving ’em all the
time, they begins to get real thirsty. A.
man who knows his job don’t put ’em
in a mob to cut out his poddies and
cleanskins: he drops the cows as he
goes along. They’re thirsty. They don’t
trouble about their calves. They make
straight back for water, stringing along
in twos and threes and putting out the
drivers’ tracks as they work back over
'em. When those cows has had their
drink they start out again for the last
place where they saw' their calves —that’s
miles and miles away. That splits up
them cows with swollen udders, and the
stockmen don’t have the fact forced
home on them.
“When the dodger’s got his cleanskins
home at his own place he don’t want to
be in no hurry. Them calves is dead
thirsty by that time. When he puts ’em
on water he knows them poddies ain’t
going to stir from that water and the
beat where he lets ’em go. The dodger
mixes ’em with his own cattle. He keeps
an eye on ’em, and when they’ve for-
gotten their own mothers, and if some
other dodger ain’t lifted ’em in the
meantime, then he puts his brand on
(hem, and they’re his property. Few men
could swear to any calf after it’s left
its mother, and none could convince a
jury.
“Of course, if the man’s going to squib
the issue, like Jerry Echlin did, then it’s
better for him to stay at home, like
Jerry did after his big shock. A man’s
got to have a bit of bounce and cheek
about him, carrying the hallmark of
righteous indignation.
“Once in the mulga country in the
sou’-west, there was one of the smartest
fellows that ever pulled on a pair of
boots. We’ll call him Joe Brown. Joe
has a bit of a place below Windorah.
They didn’t call it poddy-dodgin’ in those
days, neither; they referred to it is as
cattle-stealing. Anyway, Joe in his play-
ful way lifts a bit of a mob. He’d been
six days and nights without getting no
proper sleep, and he was pretty near
seeing double when he was ready to let
the poddies go on his own country. And
just as he was riding away from ’em he
got word that a party, with a couple of
policemen with ’em, was camped three
miles behind him on the river!
“Joe had a couple of dogs what could
do sums —well, they made mental
arithmetic of it, being silent in their
work. Joe took his dogs and them pod-
dies, tired as he was, and he shoved ’em
in on the river two miles behind the
party what was behind him. He did a
pretty wide sweep to do it, too, so’s not
to disturb them babes in the woods.
“In the morning, just breaking day-
light, Joe trots into the camp. There
was a lot of wild pigs running in that
country. The night before the party
had killed one and hung it on a mulga.
After Joe’d done talking they apologised
for coming on to his place without
notice, and paid him a fiver for killing
one of his wild pigs.
“Then there’s the enthusiastic fellow,
real game when he’s chasing a thing
what’s running away from him, and who’s
too frightened to move if he happens to
catch it. I had one of them things once,
and he proved an embarrassment till 1
got rid of him.
“Three of us reckoned it was a shame
the way Poolpootra station was letting
their micks run without a brand. We held
a meeting and passed a unanimous vote
it would be an act of charity to brand
a few for ’em. Barney was a good man
with a useful son ; Tom and me both
had a nigger each what had been trained
in the oyster school of speech. Pool-
pootra was a bit outside our ambits
like, being out in the plain country,
while we belongs to the timber and the
mountains. But it was a shame to think
them big cleanskins was eating their
heads off and looking for a stamp.
“We collected a mob of about three
hundred. We was bringing ’em back in
great style, with the mountains showing
clear ahead of us, with the poddies dodg-
ing comfortable, and with us taking a
drink of water and snatching a wink of
sleep now and again. Tom had gone on
ahead a bit to see what was next on the
schedule of events, and I seen him com-
ing close to us, drawing in near a clump
of timber as he came. And behind us,
at the same time, I seen another man
coming! It was McLean, the manager of
Poolpootra! He was the cove what used
to fill a column or two of the local press
every now and again, telling what he’d
do to a dodger if he caught one.
“I done a bit of quick thinking. Tom
was riding a bay mare what he thought
a lot of, and I was on my old Babette.
We were both about the same make and
shape, though Tom had brown trousers
and a white shirt and I had white strides
and a blue shirt. I thought of all that as
I rode to meet Tom. I met him the
other side of the timber, out of sight
of McLean. I explained quick. Tom
didn’t need much to let him see daylight.
We changed horses and swopped clothes.
Then Tom rode back to the cattle, look-
ing like Colin, and I stayed behind the
bushes, right in McLean’s road, looking
like Tom and feeling for the revolver.
“McLean comes along. He was look-
ing ahead, noting no difference in the
men what was driving the cattle, and
perhaps he was pinning medals to him-
self while he was cogitating about the
moral effect of virtue over vice. When
he was level with me, and just as he
rode round the trees, I fired a shot across
his bows. T was that close to him that
the puff of powder blew across his face.
“You can't never tell what a man’s
reactions is going to be. I was pre-
pared for the fellow to show fight,
though that was an outside, bet. What
I did expect him to do, when things was
brought home to him like that, was for
him to wheel his horse and race away.
That’s what I wanted him to do. 1 knew
a skite like him would never dare men-
tion that he’d run from us, from one
shot, and we’d be safe. But 1 hadn’t
reckoned on Mac’s literature: he must
have been reading Wild West stories.
“S’elp me goodness, the puff of
powder hadn’t cleared from his face
before his hands was in the air above
his head—best moving-picture style—and
he was surrendering, begging pardon,
offering ransom and telling me he was
a married man with a wife and family
all in one breath.
“I didn’t want him to know who I
was, and I only wanted to see him a
fading dot on the skyline. But he
wouldn’t go! That provocation for a
widow and a family of orphans just sat
on his horse, his hands clutching for
clouds, and he told me he’d be good in
the future, or words to that effect.
“The finish of that lot was that we
had to take him into the camp, letting
him help us to steal his own cattle, until
we paid him off next day with a crook
cheque, taking his receipt that it was for
wages due, and for information supplied,
in helping us to lift a lot of Poolpootras.
“Mac never squealed all the time he
was in the district, and he ain’t likely
to now that he’s gone away. While he
was here he was a big noise in the Pre-
vention of Cattle-stealing Association,
and he used to shout for Tom, Barney
and me every time he met us in town.
I don’t think he ever tried to cash our
cheque. I know we still hold his receipt.
“But the game ain’t what it was.
“There ain’t any profit in it now.
There’s fun, of course, but I’m not rich
enough to be able to devote me time to
amusing meself ; so I’ve given it a miss
in baulk.”
The Moonlit Door.
Hundreds of years the oaks had stood;
Such gnarled and battered weary things!
And here at night the viper crept,
And here the bat with haunted wings.
There were black roots to trip your feet
And ghostly shapes for you to meet
And, overgrown with moss and vine,
And gnarled and wounded like the trees
With ancient loopholed walls and towers,
And broken gardens reft of bees,
The castle stood, its oubliettes
Hiding the deeds man fain forgets
And yet between the boughs, a space
Of sky gleamed that grim keep before,
And in the endless pit of shade
Let moonlight through to find a door —
A door fast-clamped with iron bars,
To shut out hope and life and stars.
A moonlit door in silver patched;
A ray to make a shining key;
In the repelling of the wood
A beckoning shape of mystery
I turned my charger’s head away,
But it has haunted me all day!
1 left behind the haunted wood,
The home of were-wolf and of bat;
I left behind the halls of hate;
Yet, with a strength I wonder at,
Still calls to me by sea and shore
The flickering moonlight on a door.
A torch to lead to love and fate?
A lure to slight and fairy things?
I have forgotten broken towers
And witch-wolves’ cry and black bats’ wings,
Because I think night offered me
To that one door a magic key.
All day I tilted at the ring;
All night I lay and heard the rain;
It whispered to my restless heart
“You cannot find that wood again,
Nor trace the tangled path once more
That led to that enchanted door.”
And in my broken dreams a face
Pale as a pearl is held to mine;
I see it in the mirror’s steel;
I see it in the yellow wine.
O unbarred door, with moonbeams crost,
What was it that my sick soul lost?
QUEENSLAND.

Over £290,000,000 has been deposited with
the nine Australian trading banks by their
Australian customers. In addition, nearly
£70,000,000 has been invested in these in-
stitutions by their shareholders.
How is the money used by the banks?
They keep approximately £48,000,000 cash
reserves in the form of Australian Notes
and coin in their tills at their 2,660 odd
branches and in balances with the Com-
monwealth Bank.
The money in their tills enables them to meet

The Captain's Strategy.
BY WILL LAWSON.
CAPTAIN BULLY LANG had been
on the China coast for many years;
he hated to remember how long.
And he knew everything there was to be
known of that part of the Seven Seas,
from piracy to lipsticks and kohl.
On this quiet morning he lay on the
settee in his cabin in the Cheang See,
smoking and thinking, yet still with an
ear alert for any sounds from the deck
which might call for his attention. Bully
Lang was stout and ruddy ot lace , his
voice rang like a bull’s bellow when he
was roused, but in repose it could be as
soft as a sigh.
The Cheang See was on her way from
Singapore to Hong Kong on what is
known as “the pirates’ trail,’ since so
many ships have been pirated between
these ports. For four days she had been
a ship of peace, gliding over a smooth
sea, and so far all had gone well. Too
well. Captain Lang thought. They were
almost a day ahead of time ; it was too
good to be true. And as this thought
took form in his mind he sat up and
listened.
“I knew it. There they are, he ex-
claimed under his breath.
He lay down again to await events.
In a few minutes a big, smiling Chinese
stepped into the cabin and closed the
door. .
“Good morning, captain. he said.
“I’m Chu Sing, Number One pirate.”
“Good morning,” said Bully Lang,
without rising. “Have a cigarette,
Chu Sing. I take it those would be your
men firing on deck just now? No
damage done, 1 hope?” . M
“Merely blank cartridges, captain,
the Chinese said apologetically, and they
both laughed.
Chu Sing continued:
“We are one hundred strong and we ve
seized your ship without bloodshed.
I’m just letting you know, captain.”
He leaned back in a chair and smoked
one of the captain’s cigarettes.
“Thanks, I’m obliged,” said the cap-
tain, his round face still expressing no-
thing but contentment.
The seizure of his ship had been easy.
None of the officers had troubled to
carry firearms, and, since the burning of
the Sunning by pirates and the hanging
of six of the miscreants three months
before, he did not blame them. It was
natural for them to think that piracy had
been stamped out. But he knew
Chinese pirates better than that.
While Chu Sing played with the cap-
tain’s automatic, which he had idly taken
from a drawer within his reach, they
spoke of the Sunning as two wise old
friends would do. Chu Sing knew of
Bully Lang, though he had never met
him before, and he, like all Chinese,
respected a man of girth and physical
bulk. _ ,
“After the Sunning affair, we re tak-
ing no chances,” the pirate said. We re
using blank ammunition and moving
about in large gangs. Then nobody can
say we tried to kill, nor can we be over-
come as the pirates of the Sunning were.
The captain flipped the ash of his
cigarette on to the carpet and said, speak-
ing in Chinese, of which tongue in its
maritime dialects he had a good com-
mand:
“What made the Sunning gang think
there would be silver on a ffiip bound
from Amoy to Hong Kong? „
“I think they got the wrong ship, Chu
Sing replied.
“And when they found none, why
should they go mad and set fire to the
ship?”
“They had a bad leader, a common
man, a Hakki.”
“Well, they made trouble for them-
selves and everybody else,” the captain
soliloquised. “They took a big risk, too,
with the after-guard on the bridge pot-
ting at them with rifles, while they
dodged the flames. That was a hell of
a thing to happen. And what did the
skipper and officers get for saving the
ship? Nothing. Not a damned stiver!
Had to refit themselves in clothes and
all, while the company warned them
never to do that again, damaging their
ship, endangering passengers and antag-
onising trade.”
“Six pirates were hanged,” said Chu
Sing sententiously. “That was done to
stop piracy.” He laughed. Therefore
we had to show that pirates still can be
pirates, but without risking their necks.
Look, captain, you are a reasonable man.
You look at things in the right light. If
the piracy is successful and profitable
no hitch, you understand, or attempt to
communicate with the or other
ships—l will give you good ‘cumshaw,’
perhaps £200.”
“Please yourself, Chu Sing,” the cap-
tain said indifferently. “I’m not moving
a finger one way or another. I want to
take the’ ship into port intact with every
man whole, and the cargo can go hang.
Help yourself to anything you want, but
don’t do any unnecessary damage if you
want to remain my friend.”
Chu Sing leaned forward and put out
his hand.
“I am your friend. I will not injure
the wireless or anything else, but I must
ask you to come down to the saloon
while I muster the passengers and crew.
It is just a matter of form.”
Three tall, armed pirates pushed into
the cabin.
“Who has cigarettes?” said one.
“Help yourselves,” the captain said.
“If the tin is empty, look in the cupboard.
All right, Chu Sing, I’ll come down. How
much do you expect to get from this
ship? ”
“The compradore says 10,000 dollars
in bar silver ; and we have some wealthy
passengers to fleece, of course. But it will
be nothing like the haul they got from
the Ning Shin.”
“Tsui-sau did that, didn’t he?” the
captain said. “A great pirate, that man,
and a good seaman and navigator. 1
heard that when they were going into
Bias Bay the captain of the Ning Shin
was doubtful about the draught and
Tsui said, ‘Don’t worry, captain—l’ve
been in here with a ship twice a year for
years past and know my way.’
Chu Sing laughed.
“Yes, we all know the coast, he said.
“Now, please, to the saloon!”
The saloon had been made the head-
quarters of the pirates. ~
As they left the cabin, a pirate picked
up the captain’s double-barrelled gun and
began playing with it. He took it to
pieces as he walked along the deck, others
looking on. But he could not fit it to-
gether again, and with an oath of im-
patience he threw it overboard.
“Here, that’s a bit thick, Chu Sing!
the captain exploded.
“What is that?” Chu Sing asked in his
quiet tones, which suggested an English
schooling.
“That fellow threw my gun over-
board.” .
The pirate in question was looking a
little self-conscious.
“Too bad!” Chu Sing said. Pulling
out a roll of Hong Kong money, he
peeled oft' 200 dollars and gave them to
the captain. “You can now buy a new
gun,” he said. . . „ .
“Thank you. That’s the spirit, the
captain said, and they continued on their
way to the saloon.
There the officers had been mus-
tered, except the second mate, who
was on the bridge, Chu Sing had given
orders that speed was to be reduced so
that the ship would pass Waglan Light
outside Hong Kong after dark. The slow
rumble of the engines told that his orders
were being obeyed.
The examination of the 650 Chinese
passengers began —there were no Euro-
peans. Bully Lang knew he was expected
to stay till it was over. That was the
one thing Chu Sing would want -to have
the captain with him all the time, so
that he could not start any trouble.
Not only the male passengers were
searched and deprived of their money
and valuables; the women were also
despoiled. They seemed glad the thing
was done so quietly. They had heard
about the Sunning and the hours oi
pitiful terror which her passengers had
endured while battle and murder raged
on deck and fire swept the midships part
of the ship. ,
It was dusk when the search was ended
and Chu Sing and Captain Lang came on
deck. To his dismay Chu Sing saw
Waglan Light shining in the blue dusk.
“This will not do,” he “Why
were my orders not carried out?”
“We’ve been crawling along,” the
second mate complained. “If we stop,
we’ll cause suspicion. That steamer over
there is as curious as a billy-goat.”
“Steer away from the land and away
from that ship! ”
The anxious pirate at the wheel spun
it wildly; and the second mate’s wrath
was roused. ,
“Why don’t you spit on your hands '
he said scornfully. The man promptly
did so, but it did not improve his steering.
This queer action by the Cheang See,
since it took her clear away from any
recognised course, was too much for the
other ship. She began to Morse, first
to the Cheang See and, when that vessel
did not answer, to the lighthouse, which
was now in clear signalling distance,

owing to the descending darkness. When
this was pointed out to Chu Sing he was
furious.
“Let them mind their own business,”
he said. “Steer straight for the light-
house. Let them see we don’t care.”
“They’ll think we’re on a merry-go-
round,” the second mate said as he
ordered the helm up again. But the
turning of the ship brought about 50
pirates racing up the ladder to the bridge,
all jabbering their alarm at being headed
for Hong Kong.
“No catchee Bias Bay, all die!” they
shouted.
But Chu Sing would have none of that.
This was to be a peaceable piracy. “I
trust the officers of the ship,” he said,
and ordered his men to be silent.
just after midnight, travelling at half-
speed, the Cheang See passed Hong Kong
harbor entrance. She was some miles
offshore but close enough in to see the
lights of homes on the Peak and at
Kowloon and the lights of the lower
harbor. Little did the complacent citizens
of Britain’s outpost of empire and the
guardians of her prestige in the Far East
know that another British ship was on
her way to Bias Bay, the six hanged
pirates of the Sunning notwithstanding.
At six bells —three o’clock in the morn-
ing—-the Cheang See anchored off a small
village in Bias Bay.
“Lower five lifeboats,” Chu Sing
ordered. He was in a good temper, for,
as he had just told the captain, the piracy
had yielded more than he had expected—
in all, over £4OOO.
“Why five boats?” the mate asked.
“Two will be ample.”
“Very well, lower two boats,” Chu
Sing agreed, “but be quick. And you
and the captain must come with us in
case you fire on us after we leave. Then
you can bring the boats back.”
It was done as Chu Sing ordered.
Two boats made several trips, landing
the loot, which included some bolts of
silk and woollens. Chu Sing also took
two very rich Chinese to be held for
ransom. He promised the captain that
he would treat them kindly. All had
gone so smoothly, he would do nothing
to anger the captain. But these two
merchants were too rich to miss. Their
families wept as the stout breadwinners
were rowed away.
When all the loot was landed, Chu
Sing came to the captain, thanked him
and shook hands.
“I’m sorry to leave such good company
as you and your officers provide,” he
said. “It has been a friendly piracy,
and I ask you to accept this present.”
The present was a roll of notes —
about 10,000 dollars.
“Thank you.” Captain Lang just
touched the money with his hand. “And
I ask you, Chu Sing, to give that money
to the poor.”
“It shall be done,” Chu Sing answered,
not displeased at the captain’s refusal of
his gift.
“There’s one thing I do appreciate,"’
Bully Lang said, “and that is your con-
sideration in leaving the wireless un-
touched. I shall now be able to send a
message to Hong Kong which will startle
them. We aren’t due there till to-
morrow.”
Chu Sing laughed at the words, which
were said in English. He repeated the
remark to his men, who roared with
laughter. They were happy, for Chinese
do not like bloodshed. They would much
rather get wealthy without it.
And the message did startle Hong
Kong. Not a word about the Cheang
See had been received. Evidently the
lighthouse and the other steamer had
not got her name or recognised her. But
the surprise caused by the message from
the captain was nothing to the indigna-
tion which blazed through the settlement
when the Cheang See dropped anchor off
the Praya in the early morning light, as
though she said, primly:
“Look at me, I’ve been pirated, and
not a sign to show it.”
The very scatheless state of her
was an affront to the power of the
nations; that after the hanging of six
pirates a gang would dare to board a
ship, rob the passengers and get away
without a scratch to themselves or the
ship was unbelievable. Though the
officers might lose everything, the public
demanded that they should fight for their
ship. Public opinion demanded that war-
ships be sent to Bias Bay to “smoke out
the hornets’ nest.” That was the much-
used expression.
But Bias Bay is not a hornet’s nest, and
never was. It is a wide bay with many
farms and villages on its shores.
When the swift destroyers arrived no
pirates were there, only a few villagers
and farmers and their women and
children. As a measure of moral suasion
and to placate the public, the ships fired
a few shells which may or may not have
killed anyone, and went back to Hong
Kong. No doubt Chu Sing was in Hong
Kong himself by then, planning some
other trading venture.
At any rate, the Cheang See was not
there, nor her captain. They were far
away, ploughing through a peaceful sea,
bound for Tientsin, and lookouts chant-
ing “All’s well!” and a Chinese singer
making music for the forecastle hands.
And, safe in the bank at Hong Kong,
locked and double-locked in a deep-set
strongroom, lay three gold bars, worth
more than £3OOO, which had been in the
locker under the settee in the captain’s
cabin while the happy pirates smoked
the captain’s cigarettes.
Bully Lang had been on the China
coast a long time.

BY M. G. SKIPPER.
IN a bedroom in a European palace a
queen was awaiting the arrival of a
baby. Outside the palace gates a
nation which values its independence was
as cage,ly awaiting the arrival, for on
depended the answer to the question
whether a Dutch monarch should rule
Holland or whether the country would
go as a fief to a German princeling,
There had been previous occasions when
the same hope had stirred the nation,
only to be disappointed. On the other
side of the world 50,000,000 brown,
yellow, white and brindled subjects of
the expectant mother—or those of them
who had heard of it—also waited.
In due course the royal labor was
brought to a successful conclusion. The
news was flashed under the oceans, and
the Government of Java ordained that
the people should celebrate.

nese gambling game, and at scores of
little tables the Chinese are reaping a
rich harvest.
In the evenings a troupe of Malays
from Singapore present “Prins Hamlet”
to spellbound audiences in an atap
theatre. The melancholy Dane, enor-
mously whiskered and clad in doublet
and hose, plus a policeman’s helmet,
breaks into lugubrious song at the
slightest provocation ; “To be or not to
be” he sings to the tune of “Under the
Deodars” and the accompaniment of a
native gamelang. In the final scene he
runs amok, krises Polonius, who has made
a second appearance after being killed
earlier, and involves Ophelia, Laertes, the
King, the Queen, Rosenkrantz and crafty
Guildenstern in a general shambles.
Long torchlight processions wind
through the streets amidst the clashing
of Arab cymbals, Chinese tom-toms and
Javanese gandrongs. The Chinese carry
a dragon whose head is out of sight
before its tail has made its appearance ;
and the Balinese, horribly masked, scare
the children into fits and then make them
laugh with a thirty-foot cock which
crows loudly.
All the night through gyrate the rong-
gengs—women whose morals match the
profession of dancing. There is a con-
tinuous session of the wayang-wayang,
the national theatre which has survived
since Hindu times, despite the attempts
of the Mohammedan censors to sup-
press it.
The stage is a white screen. Behind
it squat the orchestra with bowls, bells,
drums and the deep-throated alang-
alang, a rude instrument of very ancient
origin, consisting of some dozen bam-
boo tubes cut like organ-pipes in dif-
ferent lengths, and hung loosely in a
frame, which, when shaken or set swing-
ing by the breeze, gives forth a strange,
haunting melody. Behind the screen are
rows of wooden figures strung in readi-
ness, the weirdest figures ever conceived
in a nightmare. Nevertheless, they are
the gods, goddesses, beautiful virgins,
ganas and heroes of ancient India, multi-
armed and spider-headed, and each
wielding a symbolic weapon, the
thunderbolt of Indra, the swastika,
trisula or chamara.
The operator pulls the strings, and
their shadows, thrown on the screen by
a smoky oil-lamp, perform an episode
from the Mahabharatta, whose words
are intoned by an ancient elocutionist in
a long-forgotten language. A graceful
shadow like fretted lace is thrown on
the screen —it is a holy mountain. God
Krishna ascends it and does battle with
the demon Yakshas, who have usurped
the summit. He is flung down again and
again, but, like Tom Mix, this defeat
only stimulates his ardor. The voice of
the elocutionist breaks on a climax, the
orchestra bursts into a,joyous wedding
march and Krishna leads the heroine
down to the plain in triumph. She has
six arms, two of which emanate from
her back, and her nose is elongated like
a tapir’s.
Outside a tandak is in progress. Four
powdered, bedizened and bejewelled
women stand in the centre of a crowd,
behind them sits another orchestra, and
at their feet is a big brass bowl. They
begin to dance seductively, using all the
wealth of gesture and abandonment of
action for which the native dancer is
remarkable. A master of ceremonies
spins before them, simulating passion
and beseeching them in pantomime.
Then an onlooker rushes forward, grasps
him by the neck and squeezes his face
and the face of each of the women in
turn together, making them exchange a
lingering osculation. Then, if he is brave
enough, he follows suit himself, and,
flinging some coins into the bowl, dances
himself off, amidst the somewhat shud-
dering applause of the audience.
This is a newly-invented entertain-
ment. Kissing is not a local custom, but
native servants have seen their mistresses
and masters kiss, and possibly spied won-
deringly on white lovers, and some enter-
prising entrepreneur has capitalised their
reaction of shocked amazement.
In the middle of another group duel-
lists are engaged in mock sword-fighting,
but the applause is moderate, for there Is
sterner stuff to-morrow. This is the
bamboo-fighting.
It is a recollection of the old heroic
days, before the Dutch insured peace
with a mercenary army, when native
armies marched, eunuchs overturned
kings, and princesses donned man’s
attire and fought like Joan of Arc for
Javanese nationalism against the Mos-
lems.
A huge, swaying ring is formed, kept
in shape by the short whips of the
Regent’s police. One district faces an-
other. The weapons, tough, springy rat-
tans about eight feet in length and split
to give a cutting edge, are laid in a pile
in the centre. Challenges are shouted
across the circle, defiance and abuse are
hurled from side to side, a loud voice
is heard making some pointed allusions
to the ancestry of a rival champion.
Presently a score of men from each side
stand facing each other in the middle.
Each picks his man. There are old scores
to settle. They retire to gird themselves.
Each strips himself to his sarong, which
he wraps tightly round his loins. He
then ties his long hair into a secure knot
and binds a scarf across his chest,
leaving arms and shoulders bare. Fine
figures they make, facing each other,
watchful, muscles braced, feet wide
apart, human tiger cats. They hold their
weapons in both hands, one arm carried
far back, the other pushed well forward,
so that the canes bend behind their heads
like bows.
Smack! One man has struck. His blow
has caught his rival fair across the lips,
and the blood leaps. The struck man
throws his head back and roars with
laughter, while his opponent makes a tour
of the enemy’s camp, leaping in the air
and exposing a derisive posterior in their
faces.
Each contestant strikes in turn. There
is no rough and tumble. The next stroke
whistles harmlessly over the first man’s
head, and his nimble stern is once more
uttering silent but eloquent insults. And
so it goes on until one or other flinches,
his legs begin to tremble and his eyes to
wander. Then he breaks and runs, while
one half the circle leaps in unison into
the air shouting “Sorak!” the Malay
triumph, and the other half mutters im-
precations.
Contest follows contest, but there is no
foul play until one young man, exas-
perated by defeat at the hands of a
grizzled champion, hits out of turn. The
ring breaks up, despite the leg-slashings
of the police, and half the crowd starts
to fight, while the other half goes in pur-
suit of the delinquent, who is hotfoot for
his mountain village. “After this,” says
a Dutch official, “bamboo-fighting will
be prohibited, along with the old bull-
fighting and tiger-baiting. We can't
afford to let the inlanders get it into their
heads that they are warriors like their
forefathers.”
Meanwhile the white community is
doing its part. Free champagne flows in
the little club, there is dancing until the
small hours and then, the stout burghers
and their wives, inwardly illuminated,
march in procession round the Aloon
Aloon in the wake of a native band
which had been taught to play “Mollie
Riley,” “Knocked ’Em in the Old Kent
Road” and “Rule, Britannia,” ten years
previously by an Englishman and had
learnt nothing fresh since he departed.
All things living are predestined to
flower, well or ill, to perish and to be re-
born. The baby we made all the fuss
about is now in the full bloom of Dutch
womanhood. The culture that was intro-
duced to Java ten or a dozen centuries
ago by Hindu merchants and their atten-
dant artisans, artists and philosophers
bloomed in the temples and palaces of
Burubudur, Parambanan and Mendut,
struggled for seven centuries against the
iconoclasm of the Mohammedan zealots
and has perished at the hands of Western
industrialism, whose advance agents are
Japanese salesmen and Australian show
boats.
A new culture is arising. A huge oil
tank stands on the beach at Toya Harom,
a blue and scarlet filling-station brightens
a market-place packed with sarongs, slen-
dangs and kabayas manufactured in Bir-
mingham and Osaka. The crowds who
used to follow the fortunes of Krishna,
the divine shepherd boy, in the wayang-
wayang, are gazing at Greta Garbo,
billed in “Flames of Passion,” at the
brand-new cinema overlooking the Re-
gent’s palace. A leader in the local ver-
nacular paper sternly warns the Gov-
ernment against the spread of Red pro-
paganda amongst the once so loyal and
so peaceful villagers. The three blue
mountains still look gravely down on the
steaming town, the centre one still smok-
ing a meditative pipe and the swinging
curves of the slopes between them still
as lovely as a woman’s shoulders.
Too Late.
I know now, after all these empty days
And haggard, hateful nights,
I could have kept you! Oh, in many ways
I might have newly lit love’s festal lights
° In your sweet eyes!
I have known women since, and played at love
(At love with desperate memories of you).
I have learnt wisdom, so that now I prove
Faithless, yet faithful, false to you though
true,
A fool —but wise.
1 know, at last, the little, tender ways
To end our quarrels in a deeper passion;
And know, too well for peace, the lovely maze
Of inconsistencies that women lashion
To guard the gate
That opens to their hearts; how lips may say
Cold, cruel things to hide complete surrender;
How scorn oft hid your tears. And know
_ strength, to keep you, should
be tender.
I know —I know —too late!

The Long White Road.
Across the wall of strong blue hills
I watch the white road go—
The long white road, that is to me
A shining path of mystery,
Rich with the lure of stars and sea
That all earth’s wand’rers know.
What messengers of life and death
Passed there, with smiles and tears!
It felt the burdened steps and slow;
It saw the dreamers come and go;
It knew the glorious hours that glow
Like stars in after years.
What splendid hopes it heard from those
Who took the rover’s track,
Whose lives the rolling years would fill
With power and wealth and fame. And still
The patient roadway waited till
The wrecks came drifting back.
O wise white roadway, winding west,
If magic gave you speech
What tales surpassing human worth
Of love that glorifies the earth,
Of pathos, laughter, tears and mirth,
Could you not tell of each!
