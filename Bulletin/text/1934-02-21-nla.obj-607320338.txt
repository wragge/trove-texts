Dewar’S Cairngorm
WmMm ' ■
filled with Scotland’s Finest Whisky
A romantic interest attaches to the Dewar s
Cairngorm Flagon, with its traditional
markings and jewel-like centre. Thus the
natural appreciation of a spirit that is out-
standing even among choice Scotch whiskies
is heightened by an accompanying interest
in the story of the Cairngorm itself. The
Cairngorm Flagon holds
a quart of Dewar’s
Imperial, and is obtain-
able at all better hotels.
THE STORY OF THE
CAIRNGORM
The story of the Dewar’s Cairngorm Flagon is
one that you will take pleasure in recounting.
The designer of the Cairngorm Flagon has
taken as his motif the typical Highland shoulder
brooch, in the centre of which is usually set
a precious stone that comes from the Cairngorm
Mountains of Scotland. Many and elaborate
are the various designs of these shoulder
brooches worn with full regalia at brilliant
Scottish festivals. In the Dewar’s Cairngorm
Flagon the round face of the flagon is of
satin-finish glass ornamented with a design of
Gaelic inspiration in imitation of the silver
portion of the brooch. The crystal-cut centre
with its gleaming facets, through which the soft
amber colour of the whisky is transmitted, is a
perfect representation of a Cairngorm itself.
Specially, designed for the proper presentation
of Dewar’s, the beautiful Cairngorm Flagon
does complete justice to a very choice whisky.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times o!
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS BOOKS
The Gloomy Deans
It is an odd coincidence that the two
most celebrated clerics that the Anglican
Church has produced should have been
Deans, political journalists and despisers
of mankind ; and that they should have
been condemned as unbelievers by many
of their contemporaries. The supreme
heresy of both from the Christian stand-
point is not their lack of charity as con-
troversialists, but their denial of anthro-
polatry. Dean Inge has said over and
over again: “There are many things in
the world more divine than man. It is an
unproved assumption that the domina-
tion of the planet by our own species is
a desirable thing which must give satis-
faction to its Creator.” And Swift said
over and over again that there were few
things on the planet so criminal as man.
Yet both were ordained as believers in
the Incarnation.
Taine wrote of Swift: “In his hands
the newspaper in England attained its
proper character and its greatest force.
Literature entered the sphere of politics.”
The newspaper invectives of Inge are
literature, too. They could not be other-
wise ; his style—masculine, logical, clear
and pure as crystal—has only been
matched in English by Swift’s. Scorn or
hatred of a race, an institution or an in-
dividual was an inspiration to both dur-
ing their journalistic prime. Particularly
to Swift. If the Benefices Act had existed
in his day he might well have been in-
hibited for breaking his ordination vows
to promote “quietness, peace and love
among Christian people.”
The gloom for which both divines are
noted originated in the same cause —an
arid pessimism, expressed in phrases that
stick in everybody’s memory.
The Churches have little influence; and if
they had more they would not know what to
do with it.
Ancient civilisations were destroyed by im-
ported barbarians: we breed our own.
Swift would have entirely agreed with
those pronouncements by Inge.
Study in Frustration
In Swift, by Mario M. Rossi and J. M.
Hone (Gollancz ; Dymock’s ; 16s.), the
Dean’s egotism is stressed. His poverty
and ill-health, the consciousness that the
rich, powerful people with whom he asso-
ciated were pigmies beside himself, no
doubt added to his natural arrogance. He
was forced to assert himself. In any
event he had a Luciferian pride. In this
biography his character is deduced from
the works which were published in his
own time; a sound method since the
“Journal” reveals little more than the
names of the distinguished folk who en-
tertained him.
Did he believe in any form of religion?
To Voltaire he was the “supreme type of
anti-Christian.” Temple Scott, who
edited his religious writings, could find
little about religion in them, and Leslie
Stephen thought he was loyal to the
Anglican Church “simply because that
Church happened to be his.” There are
interesting resemblances between the
position of the Church in his day and at
the present time. Then the religious
wars were over and Anglicanism had
won, but it was being subtly assailed by
Roman Catholics on the one hand and
by Nonconformists on the other. Now
it is being assailed by High Churchmen
(some of whom, like the late Lord Hali-
fax, go so far as to advocate reunion with '
Rome) and by scientists. Dean Inge,
who has witnessed brawls in his own
cathedral, defends his religion as Swift
did, but like Swift he seems to be an
official first and a believer afterwards.
In most respects, of course, their times
were utterly different. Swift lived in a 1
brutal age when he could write of Lord
Wharton, who had slighted him: —
He bears the gallantries of his lady with the
indifference of a Stoic, and thinks them well
recompensed by a return of children to support
his family, without the fatigues of being a
father.
His enemies increased in numbers and
venom ; his deafness and nervous fits got
worse; he was
scandalised by a
state of affairs in
which “about half
the Parliament
was in the pay of
the Minister, who
not only bribed the members, but reached
the point of bribing the King himself.”
In such circumstances the greatest and
bitterest of his works came to be written.
“Gulliver” is another “Apologia”; an
interpretation of the writer’s unsuccessful
life by reference to the villainy and hate-
fulness of mankind.
This brilliant biography has 30-odd
pages of notes, one of which contains
Swift’s pedigree. It proves that, as he
so often claimed, he was not Irish but
English on both sides.
A Super-Journalist
Dean Inge’s God and the Astronomers
(Longman’s; Dymock’s; 10s. 6d.) is
also a kind of “Apologia.” In these
seven Warburton Lectures he sets out to
prove that it is possible to be a physicist
and an Anglican, too.
He repeats himself a good deal, par-
ticularly with regard to the Law of
Entropy, which postulates that “at a
point of time which we could date if
we knew it, the universe was created.”
His book, he says, is “a sustained
polemic against a philosophy which makes
Time itself an absolute value, and pro-
gress a cosmic principle.” He is repeti-
tive, also, concerning man’s alleged pro-
gress. There is no evidence of it, he
submits in almost every lecture. The
net surplus of pleasure over pain is not
increasing; we are not advancing in in-
trinsic excellence of body, mind or
character. Man rises only to fall again.
He agrees with Aristotle that all the
arts and sciences have been discovered
and lost “an infinite number of times.”
The doctrine of progress as a cosmic prin-
ciple.... is so manifestly a product of crude
anthropomorphism that, even apart from the
Law of Entropy, one might suppose that it
could hardly be defended by an intelligent
man.
He enters the warnings against anthro-
pologism which are to be found in most
of his writings, pointing out that “there
are other living creatures, and probably
many other worlds, which must engage
the attention of an intelligent Creator” ;
and always he comes back to his favorite
ideas: “We cannot trace the hand of
God in the development of civilisation.”
“We are no better than the contem-
poraries of Socrates.” He puts it very
strongly towards the end of his book: —-
'there is, I think, something derogatory to
the Deity in supposing that He made this vast
universe for so paltry an end as the production
of ourselves and our friends.
Asa destructive critic he is masterly.
It is only when he tries to explain why
God did create the world ; why, if He
thought us paltry, He sent His Son to
redeem us ; why Christianity has done no
more for us than Paganism, that he
becomes vague and wordy. He may
believe in the fundamentals of his faith,
but so far as can be gathered from his
writings he only believes in its ethic.
This book helps to explain the resentment
which his views arouse among orthodox
Anglicans ; most of it also explains his
Swift-like popularity with the masses
whom he despises. He is supremely easy
to read.

The War Game
The war game, as played by the arma-
ment combines, contains elements both
comic and tragic. All armament chiefs
are ultimately internationalists. This
produces some strange results.
The flower of Anzac was mown down
by cannon which had been built by
Vickers, of Britain. Of course Vickers
were not to know that things would
happen. How could they? And Vickers-
Armstrong has now a subsidiary in Japan
which supplied the Japanese with war
stuff for the Manchurian exploit—which
the British Government and League of
Nations condemned.
In all recent wars the material for
both sides has come from both sides.
The limit was reached by Krupps in
1914-18. During those years the soldiers
of the Kaiser were put out of action by

(patent) on which Krupps afterwards
claimed Is. per fuse royalties on the
120,000,000 fuses used. And the Kaiser
was, and is, a partner in the firm.
Morgan Jones, M.P., recently painted
an astonishing picture for the benefit of
the House of Commons. He described
a factory where, in one part, they
make war stuff for the Japanese; in
another part, war stuff for the Chinese.
On this scene there entered by an un-
fortunate coincidence at the same time
representatives of both the Chinese and
the Japanese Governments. What did
they find? That their joint and several
Governments were being grossly over-
charged. So they combined to present a
joint ultimatum demanding reductions in
price.
And then there was the predicament of
one of Uncle Sam’s super-salesmen who,
in 1929, sued America’s largest shipping
corporation for $255,655, for services
rendered in connection with the Geneva
naval conference of 1927, where, he
claimed, he had successfully prevented
any effective disarmament from being
realised, and so had brought his firm
orders for battleships.
These and many other matters of the
kind are dealt with by Fenner Brock-
way in The Bloody Traffic (Gollancz ;
Dymock’s ; 10s. 6d.). He is a pacifist;
but the very facts which he marshals
with such skill help to show the futility
of pacifism. Not only is mankind belli-
gerent by nature, but big business in
nearly every big country is financially
interested in fostering belligerency. No
profiteering is half so profitable as war-
stuff profiteering.
From time to time a great nation tries
to limit its armaments: Britain is the
latest case in point. Yielding to the well-
meant representations of its Fenner
Brockways, Beverley Nicholses and
“Bunny” Austins, and to the differently
inspired representations of its Russophils
it has brought its defence forces well
below the safety mark. The only result
has been that other nations —notably
Russia, Japan and the U.S.A.—have pro-
portionately strengthened their defence
forces. Blanc, proprietor of the Monte
Carlo gambling palace, once said “Rouge
wins sometimes, and noir wins sometimes,
but Blanc wins always.” The arma-
ment firms are like that: whoever loses
in the great international war game, they
always win.
G. D.
Tough Indeed!
“This is a book for ‘tough-minded’
readers only,” says Adrian Lawlor (R.P.
31/1 /’34) in a review of a book by
Herbert Read, which, he claims, “is the
most important English contribution to
aesthetic criticism since the publication of
Roger Fry’s ‘Vision and Design.’ ” Mr.
Lawlor is a bit tough himself. He says,
in his rubbery way:
The artist, subjected like his more merely
human fellows to the deterministic will of his
glands, expresses in his work a purely subjec-
tive phantasy. He draws, as we used to say,
upon his inner consciousness. He is to that
extent a law unto himself. In this process
he is ultimately powerless to control either
means or end; all is conditioned for him by
function.
The logical extension of this theory is
that the lunatic will be the greatest artist.
The lunatic, according to the alienists, is
the helpless victim of his glandular secre-
tions. In many cases he is also the victim
of the absence or excessive supply of
particular secretions. When this is the
position he develops a head out of all
proportion to his. body, or he grows up
an adult infant or an imbecile with de-
lusions of grandeur, exaggerated fear
complexes or homicidal tendencies.
Now, I can well understand how an
artist, otherwise sane and normal, can,
under the stimulus of Mr. Lawlor’s theory
of aesthetics, produce the sort of pictures
one sees in modernistic exhibitions, but
as an artist with, I hope, a set of glands
of reasonable efficiency, I strongly object
to being governed by the tough-minded
Mr. Lawlor’s rules of procedure. I would
no more invite Mr. Lawlor to dictate
to me how I should go about depicting
the world around me than I would invite
a surgeon to interfere with my glands so
that I should be obliged to grow a head
five times as big as that of the Hermes
of Praxiteles. Divested of its mumbo-
jumbo, its appearance of profundity and
its unsubstantiated judgments, the strong
meat of Mr. Lawlor’s aesthetic boils down
to the very stringy statement that there
is no objective criterion in art whatever.
The artist is “possessed,” he cannot “help
himself,” he is “haunted” ; and, because
he is all these things, he is “creative.”
This lets in the incompetent, the frivo-
lous, the deliberately fraudulent, and, as I
have pointed out, the lunatic.
If there is nothing in the external
world with which to check the truth of
his representations, then the pictures hung
by Mr. Lawlor in the exhibition he held
in Melbourne a couple of years ago after
18 months’ acquaintance with a brush
and palette must be as significant as the
Rembrandt self-portrait in the National
Gallery. I find this proposition so tough
as to be downright indigestible.
M. G. SKIPPER.
“Free” Music
Percy Grainger’s theory of “free
music,” enunciated in an interview in
Melbourne, has been attacked in the
“S.M.H.” by Ernest Wunderlich. Mr.
Wunderlich says that Grainger wants to
abolish (1) the rules of harmony; (2)
rhythm ; (3) intervals. What, he asks,
would be left of music after the repeal
had been effected? Mr. Grainger’s views
on this subject have been expressed in
American musical journals many times in
the last decade or so, and I gather that
what he really means when he says those
things that look so startling in head-
lines is that rules in any art were made
to be broken by the courageous.
Bach, Schumann, Beethoven and
Mozart held the same view. All four
flouted the academic rules of harmony
current in their time; Beethoven and
Bach, despite the formal frames within
which they wrote, were not afraid to
play all sorts of tricks with rhythm. As to
intervals, the composer is up against the
fact that all the keyed instruments, string
or wind, conform to a scale with eleven
intervals in the octave. A fiddler, ’cellist
or trombonist, playing impromptu with-
out keyed-instrument accompaniment, is
as free as air. In Grainger’s terms he can
“glide through tonal space as a bird
glides through air space.” But if his
performance takes in intervals not on the
map it can’t be scored by accepted
methods of notation.
Grainger is one of those stout souls who
advocate a pianoforte tuned in quarter-
tones —23 intervals to the octave. The
suggestion has always seemed to me to
savor of the intellectual arrogance of the
four-dimension geometers. As Grieg
(Grainger’s mentor and idol) showed,
there are vast realms of little-known har-
monic progressions and contrasts in the
well-tempered 11-note scale. It’s a daunt-
less soul that wants to raise the almost in-
finite number of combinations and per-
mutations already possible, but Grainger
may be right—there may be vast beauties
waiting to be unfolded in smaller intervals
than are at present in vogue. If so, art
will be very, very long. Keyboard navi-
gation takes half a lifetime to learn
thoroughly as things stand.

The Short Stories of Our Novelists
Until the last decade or so, our poten-
tial novelists concentrated on short
stories. Several reasons have been given:
Their wandering, interrupted lives, such
as that of Lawson ; the broken, varied
experiences of many workers in Australia,
following seasonal occupations like shear-
ing or sugar-cutting for hundreds of
miles; economic conditions, which made
it easier to get into print with a short
story, or even with a book of short
stories, than with a novel. Indeed, it
was suggested that our development, so
far as it had gone, was better interpreted
in the short story, with its variety of
approach, than in the rounded novel.
The tide has now set the other way.
In number and variety, the novels appear-
ing as by miracle out of the 12-winded
sky have ludicrously surpassed all pro-
phecies made a dozen years ago. Pub-
lished in England by obscure, by mass-
producing or by well-set firms, published
here with varying and growing success,
our novelists have pursued their difficult
and for the most part thankless task, and
certain aspects of our life have become
visible for the first time.
As for the short story, it has continued
to be practised, but there have been few
collections in book form, and those
chiefly by writers who had already pro-
duced several novels. Katharine Prichard
published “Kiss-on-the-Lips,” with its
great variety of theme and technique, and
Vance Palmer selected specimens of a
score of “Separate Lives.” These writers
clearly shared the belief that in making a
short story they were not attempting
either a summary or a fragment of a
novel but a thing in itself; and clearly
they can continue to write novels with
the other side of their heads.
NETTIE PALMER.
A Satchel of Books
Jarrah Leaves is a new annual pro-
duced by the Imperial Printing Co.,
Perth, and edited by John L. Glascock
in the interests of art and literature in
Westralia. The whole of the con-
tents, which comprise about 120 pages of
stories, sketches, playlets, poems and
drawings, are by Westralians, and
the general standard is remarkably high.
It opens with some interesting letters of
goodwill from such eminent other-Staters,
as Hugh McCrae, John Longstaff, F. D.
Davison and the Vance Palmers.
More Letters to a Married Woman, by
John H. C. Sleeman (Alert Co.; 7s. 6d.j,
deals lightly with socialisation, Musso-
lini, J. T. Lang, Hitler, the Douglas plan,
the Roosevelt plan and innumerable
other subjects of feminine interest. He
has a gift for hitting a character off in
a few words. Of Karl Marx:
He was a great tmter. He abused Lassalle
and Liebnecht. He metaphorically spat at
Hyndman. Mazzini he scorned. He was, how-
ever, through life, the loved centre of his own
family circle. He was scrupulously honest
He was in temperament dictatorial. He had
Mr. Lang’s capacity to create party eruptions,
but was a deeper thinker than any Australian
leader. He, however, was as keen on heresy
hunts, as the gymnastics to keep the party
disciplined, as any modern A.L.P. leader.
A knowledgable writer with a wide range
of interests.
Six Trials, by Winifred Duke (Gol-
lancz; Dymock’s; 55.), has at least one
strong recommendation. It keeps clear
of Crippen, Cream and other malefactors
whose cases have been dealt with by so
many crime-writers of late years. She
gives over 50 pages to the Greenwood
case, and incidentally points out that the
story about Greenwood having refused
to pay Sir Edward Marshall Hall his
“refresher” for the last day of the trial
is untrue. Marshall Hall was in another
court when the verdict of “Not guilty”
was delivered ; but all his fees, to the
tune of £759 155., were paid. Miss Duke
is particularly interesting on the subject
of the Wallace case, which she calls “The
Perfect Murder.” Wallace is the only
accused whose conviction for murder has
been quashed by the British Court of
Criminal Appeal.
Dark Angel, by Gina Kaus (Cassell;
7s. 6d.), is one of those hopelessly de-
pressing, humorless and amoral war-
aftermath novels that are pouring out of
Germany just now. Eden and Cedar
Paul haven’t made as good a job of the
translation as usual. For some inscrut-
able reason they have Americanised the
dialogue. The plot chiefly concerns
Lottie Kahn, a neuropath who is seduced
by her sister’s fiance and has a
child by him. The sister, who doesn’t
know of the relations between her hus-
band and Lottie, passes the child off on
her husband as her own while he is at the
front. The climax comes when Lottie has
a nerve-crisis, tells her sister the truth in
the husband’s presence, and drives to
her death in a car. The narrator is a
painfully sentimental old maid, with a
notable capacity for weeping.
A Short History of Painting in Eng-
land, by Miles F. de Montmorency
(Dent; 65.), is widely regarded as the best
handbook of its type in existence. Mr.
de Montmorency, though himself a
painter, seems to have no bigotries at all.
He classes Stevens as the greatest
draughtsman and Reynolds as “the great-
est natural genius as a painter” that Eng-
land has produced. He loves Revnolds
and Hogarth for their Englishism. They
never went abroad and picked up arti-
ficial styles which corresponded to no
realities in their own minds.
This is the only way in which a living art
can be produced, for just as in speech the
words must accurately fit the thought, so in
the visual arts the form must be the appro-
priate clothing to an image in the mind. Here
lies the difficulty in learning from foreign
schools.
It is an answer to much of the rubbish
that is talked and written in Australia
about the necessity of sedulously imitat-
ing every new overseas craze in painting,
writing and music. There are about 60
reproductions of famous English paint-
ings and a chronological table showing
the world’s Art movements between the
end of the eighth and the nineteenth
centuries.
City of the Rose, by Anthony Richard-
son (Bodley Head ; 7s. 6d.). It begins in
a street of Carlstadt “as well known as
the Bamebi£re of Marseilles” —which
may be a printer’s error or the
author’s subtle way of saying in an
absolutely unknown street. Anyhow, the
debonair Englishman Rankin soon found
himself in Anthony Hopeland.
“Are you there, noble sir?”
“Yes,” said Rankin.
“The Lady Floria would like to ride with
you this afternoon. If you will call at the
Schloss at three o’clock. The Lady Floria
has a mount for you.”
“Good egg,” said Rankin.
And so love came into its own.
The spell was on them.
“Say it,” she said. “Oh, Charles, say it!”
Then he spoke. And his voice, too, was
strange. It was harsh and loud and breaking.
“I love you,” he said. “Dear God, how I
love you!”
There is lots of this for the girls, and
it’s interspersed with some very pretty
fighting for the boys.
Despite its title The Australian Educa-
tional Directory and Gazette (Minerva
Publishing Service, Sydney ; 3s. 6d.) gives
information regarding only N.S.W. and
Victorian educational establishments. As
a guide for parents and guardians de-
sirous of placing children in suitable
schools in the two States named it is
invaluable.
Jake the Dog, by Norah C. James
(Dent; 55.). A picture of a dog’s world
as it seems to the dog. Miss James re-
veals the thoughts that flit through the
head of Jake when, for example, he
chases his first fowl and is punished for
it, with uncanny insight. Dogs may not
reason after the manner of this engaging
animal and his friend Brandy, but their
creator makes the reader believe they do
while under the spell of her book. There
are some fine pencil-drawings by Ruth
Vale.
J. M. Dent and Sons have published
Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sen-
sibility at ss. each. A feature of this
new edition of Jane Austen’s novels is
Maximilien Vox’s illustrations. The
famous Frenchman has a delicacy of
touch which harmonises perfectly with
the light, ironical writing. There are
eight full-page drawings in each volume.

THIS TAXATION RAMP.
The Fathers of the Commonwealth,
simple fellows, framed the Constitution
with the intention of making Australia
a nation. In their charter they included
sections like this:
117. A subject of the Queen, a resident in
any State, shall not be subject in any other
State to any disability or discrimination which
would not be equally applicable to him if he
were a subject of the Queen resident in such
other State.
So long as a few of the Fathers re-
mained in the Parliament they tried hard
to maintain their ideals, and at the same
time to keep Commonwealth and State
fields and functions separate. For in-
stance, they left direct taxation to the
States. But in 1910 Andrew Fisher, with
W. M. Hughes and George Foster Pearce
and some others, hurled the old view-
point overboard and introduced Com-
monwealth land tax.
From then onwards, the deluge.
Hughes introduced income tax and war-
profits tax. Death duties and amusement
tax were added. The war was a splendid
excuse and it was free for all. Holman
and Ryan did not stand aside because the
Commonwealth was paying for an army,
a navy and an air force. They plunged
into outrageously expensive State social-
ism, the losses on which had to be met
out of State taxes.
When the war finished, there was such
a multitude of taxation officials about
that a joint Commonwealth-States Royal
Commission was appointed to look them
and their works over. After hearing a bat-
talion of witnesses, this body turned out
one of the most suitable documents yet
printed to throw at the office cat.
Majority reports fattened it and minority
reports gave it balance. As the result of
the findings, the Commonwealth and in-
dividual States decided to pool their cun-
ning.
The joint brains of the experts im-
proved on the simple Federal income-tax
formula
5533-9 12.583 1.06 .03
Ra = 5 -1 .1 .12-1 .13
I 103 106 107
without interfering with individual efforts.
Competition bred competition. If Bavin
invented an unemployment tax, every-
body else pinched the idea, or, if it was
too strong for the local stomach,
matched it with some other tax. Family
endowment, sales tax, primage, multiplied
stamp duties all had their turn. Income
taxes and super-taxes were overhauled to
improve the leverage of the squeezer, so
as to finance an orgy of extravagance
which would have made Nero gasp.
When other sources ran dry, the grab-
bers began cracking each other’s cribs.
Hence cases like the one in which an
inheritor had death duties wrung out of
his hide by four separate authorities —in
S.A. because the man who had left him
B.H.P. shares died there; in Victoria
because the B.H.P. head office is in Mel-
bourne ; in N.S.W. because it is the
domicile of the B.H.P. and of the legatee,
and in Canberra to remind him that
Australia is a Commonwealth. Thus,
also, Sydney miscreants who dare to get
a few pounds of income from Victoria
and spend it in N. S. Wales are made to
pay income and relief taxes on it in both
States —and also on what the Common-
wealth takes in property and “special"
property taxes—or else are dragged to
court by the hair of their heads. It
means nothing to Stevens and Argyle
and Forgan Smith that inter-State ex-
pansion of firms increases the taxing field
and adds to production. On with the
thumbscrew! Squeeze them, and if the
squeezing is at variance with the spirit
of Section 117 of the Commonwealth
Constitution, be hanged to the Common-
wealth Constitution!
All this duplication has been achieved
in a time of stress, when overseas coun-
tries have striven to avoid overlapping,
and when some even have begun to see
the advantages of lowering local taxa-
tion—the States of Florida and Nevada,
for instance, which, in order to attract
investors, amended their Constitutions to
renounce the right to collect income tax.
Almost every big nation in Europe now
has a convention with its neighbors by
which it is mutually agreed to tax per-
sonal exertion only once at the domicile
of the earner, land only at its point of
location and businesses only at the actual
earning source. But while foreign coun-
tries have been able to reach agreement,
Australian States and the Commonwealth
have made no attempt to do so. More-
over, the high interest rates which Aus-
tralia paid during the boom were attribut-
able in part to its soaring taxes and its
failure to recognise (in the words of the
London “Economist”) that when a
borrowing country tries to tax lenders, the
only result is that the lenders pass the tax on
to the local debtor in the shape of a higher
rate of interest or by some such subtle means.
Justice Ferguson and Mr. Nixon, sit-
ting as a Royal Commission, are the
latest to condemn high and duplicate
taxation. Unfortunately, while stressing
the need for a uniform Assessment Act,
they would set up a board to assess and
collect all direct taxes; and this country
has far too many boards as it is. Uni-
formity and simplicity could best be
brought about by the transfer of income
tax to the Commonwealth, of land tax
and death duties to the States.
In 1913-14, the total Commonwealth
expenditure from revenue was about
£15,000,000. In a year or two Mr. Park-
hill will be getting rid of that sum in the
Post Office alone. The Prime Minister’s
Department, then newly established,
spent £82,000 the year before the war;
now two small items in its budget—the
High Commissioner’s Office and the con-
tribution to the League Secretariat —eat
up that amount. The cost of running the
Federal taxation services alone in 1931
at the depth of the depression (£491,000)
would have financed the Prime Minis-
ter’s and Attorney-General’s Depart-
ments and the Governor-General for
1913-14 while leaving enough over to
pay all expenses for Home and Terri-
tories for two pre-war years. Common-
wealth and States last year collected
£31,000,000 in income and unemploy-
ment taxes. This is 50 per cent, more
than the total taxation from all sources,
direct and indirect, levied the year before
the war.
Australian production of £209,000,000
was asked to find £22,000,000 in taxes
and duties towards running seven Gov-
ernments in 1913-14. Last year, nearly
£90,000,000 was taken in taxation out of
just over £300,000,000 in production.
Mr. Lyons, who prides himself on being
economical and a reliever of burdens,
actually spent £33,437,000 from revenue
in the half-year ended Dec. 31, 1933, as
against £32,816,000 in the corresponding
period of 1932. Mr. Stevens’s perform-
ance is better, but is far from being
enough ; and the showing of the other
three mainland States is disgraceful,
though Tasmania’s is not so bad. All told,
State deficits this year under an
“economy” plan will about equal at
£8,398,000 the whole amount levied in
direct taxation by the States and Com-
monwealth the year before the war.
Till they can do better and produce
some scheme with an immediate 50 per
cent, tax cut, a cessation of duplicate,
triplicate and quadruplicate inter-State
impositions, and a long-distance pro-
gramme of further reduction of burdens,
the Treasurers should put their haloes in
camphor and smother their self-adulation
under a pillow of humility.
SCRAP THE LOT!
The Australian industrial arbitration sys-
tem has become a richly expensive joke
entirely surrounded by horsehair. No
party resorting to one of the army of tri-
bunals which settle wages takes it
seriously. Trade-unions gamble on it
when it suits them. Agitators and others
whose hearts bleed for the poor use the
courts as an actor uses the stage. Bar-
risters and advocates regard arbitration
as a champion milch cow beside which
Melba XV was a mere heifer on her first
calf —or it should rather be said, perhaps,
that their attitude towards it is that of
the fly towards honey.
Twenty-seven lawyers clustered round
the N. S. Wales industrial fee-pot re-
cently while three wigs nodded over the
question of power to fix the wages of a
handful of State museum employees.
And when the meat employees and em-
ployers so far agreed with each other
that they were represented only by two
firms of solicitors and an industrial bar-
rister (Sydney City Council grumbled
about paying the barrister £l2OO for re-
presenting it in an argument with a sec-
tion of its swarming employees) the
Bench demanded that a second barrister
should be brought in.
Politicians, of course, look on indus-
trial arbitration only as a tool to be used
or put away as occasion demands. When
a Court is found to have a singular capa-
city for agreeing with the Trades. Hall,
business booms with employees and em-
ployers have an apoplectic look. Its
composition changed, it competes ardently
with the Commonwealth tribunal in the
task of interpreting one obvious cost of
living in terms of two entirely different
basic wages.
In the State sphere—in N. S. Wales in-
variably and in other States often —the
Government sits by and sees fair pla}#
Sometimes awards are so absurd that
even the allegedly brutal retailer will not
enforce them lest he lose sleep through
the workings of his conscience. Some-
times the State Government does not
wait for the retail conscience to work.
It announces in a firm voice, colored with
pity for the poor working man, that the
award will not be enforced.
Altogether nearly 2000 awards and
agreements have force in Australia
to-day, 1700 of them made or ratified by
State tribunals which include about 580
boards of one variety and another. Many
an important enterprise could raise wages
if it could be rid of the cost of continual
argument, of the policing of its legal obli-
gations and of the burdensome account-
ing involved in reckoning variations of
earning power in terms of eighths of a
penny per hour.
The Railway Departments provide the
worst example of what industrial arbitra-
tion has led to. They employ more
people than any other enterprise. Their
biggest union—the A.R.U. —does not be-
lieve in arbitration. Its general secretary
said of Federal arbitration: “To hell with
it! ” Its general president and its council
have been equally emphatic. But a
few months after the council’s con-
demnation the A.R.U. was in the Federal
court in holds with the N. S. Wales
and Victorian Railway Commissioners
over sectional awards in a contest
which swung from appeal to counter-
appeal for over two years. Commis-
sioners and trade-unions have been in
both the Federal and State courts ever
since. As Judge Drake-Brockman said
the other day in squashing a State award,
there are 47 railway disputes in the
Federal court alone, and the various
Commissioners “have got into such a
ghastly state of confusion through over-
lapping that they do not know where
they are.” Awards are made and then
set aside, wholly or in part, or kept in
suspense by appeals. Men working side
by side have their pay based on different
wage minimums fixed by different
authorities. Drake-Brockman, J., has now
expressed the determination of his Court
to assist all the Commissioners to obtain
a uniform railway code.
Well his Honor might! The occasion
for his remarks was the application of the
Commissioners to prevent a set of find-
ings by the N.S.W. State Industrial Com-
mission becoming operative. These were
made after two years of. inquiry during
which 1,500,000 words of evidence had
been taken. They had been held up by
the Lang Government, and the Commis-
sioners denounced them to the Appeal
Court at the point where they needed
only to be gazetted to become law. Coun-
sel for the men warned Drake-Brockman,
J., that it probably will take him two
years to re-cover the ground of inquiry
traversed by the now repudiated State
authority and that, perhaps, he might
never succeed in covering it at all. And
when the decision is given the employees
will abide by the law only if they feel
they are too weak to grab more than
they ask. Nevertheless, the State award
is to be scrapped, and the bargaining and
histrionics are to begin all over again.
There is a lot more scrapping to be
done—of systems, not of awards. The
whole peace-disturbing machinery of
arbitration and conciliation, the horsehair
and the fees, and the agitators who use
arbitration as an excuse to keep their
hands perennially in the pockets of em-
ployers and workers should all be cast on
the dustheap, so that the community
may return to clean, sane bargaining
between employers and employees, and
free itself once and for all from the
mumbo-jumbo of statistics and jargon
which embody the decisions of these
tribunals.
JOSEPH ALOYSIUS REJOICES.
The Prime Minister went to Melbourne
for the series of conferences with
a light heart. On the way thither he
received the gratifying intelligence that
he is not to have Mr. Bruce for a rival
and is to continue to have Mr. Scullin for
his chief opponent. It came straight
from the horse’s mouth, as it were.
Entertained in London by the Agents-
General, Mr. Bruce said he hoped it
would be recognised during his “visit”
to Australia that he “must hold aloof
from party politics,” so that he might be
able “to represent to Britain the Austra-
lian point of view on vital matters” when
he returned. Mr. Scullin, for his part, de-
clared in Adelaide that he and no other
person would lead the Federal Labor
party at the next general election.
This is surprisingly bold for Mr. Scul-
lin. In his long contention with Mr.
Lang he has generally been satisfied to
let others do the fighting for him. He
has rarely shed the light of his counten-
ance on those of his followers who have
kept the Federal Labor organisation
from going to pieces in N. S. Wales.
When they would have been glad of his
presence on platforms, particularly when
they were battling against great odds at
the last State election, Mr. Scullin was
always missing. True, at the Victorian
A.L.P. palavers last month he uttered a
mild protest against the exclusion of this
N.S.W. branch, which includes “15
former Federal Labor members,” from
the next “unity” conference; but when
exclusion was decided upon he meekly
subsided.
Presently, to his astonishment, Mr.
Crofts, the leading Langster at the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall—the same whom the
Lang Government placed on its Gas
Board and presented with a railway
pass so that he might attend meetings
and collect fees —failed of election as a
delegate to the “unity” conference, along
with other Lang sympathisers. Mr. Scul-
lin’s heart then began to rise from his
boots. The return of the organ to its
regular position was completed when
the A.W.U. convention refused to let
the N.S.W. section of the union join the
Lang faction. N.S.W. was willing (among
its delegates was secretary McNeill, who
was a member of the Scullin Govern-
ment in its last phase), but the
other States were not. The conven-
tion even refused to permit the Tas-
manian branch to send representatives to
a Labor conference in that State, the
Tasmanian Labor party, influenced by
Lang and his friends in the islet, having
seceded from Federal Labor.
Sure now of A.W.U. support, Mr.
Scullin made the declaration referred
to. He doubtless considered Adelaide, in
which there have been several Lang
“parties”—two are represented in the
Assembly by three members, one of
whom has declared the others “black” —
a very appropriate place in which to
make it.
The Lyons Government has nothing to
fear from Mr. Scullin. It is impossible
to picture that gentleman ever leading a
party to victory again; impossible to
imagine the Lang group, which quitted
his lamentable Government and used a
trumped-up charge of Tammanyism to
turn it out, returning to serve under
“Radio Jimmy,” as it called him. That
would be a spectacle that would make all
Australia laugh, and to invite the ridicule
of the constituencies is the worst possible
way to gain them. A.W.U. influence is
not what it was in Fisher’s time, but the
old union is still the most powerful poli-
tical Labor organisation in Australia.
Unless it can induce both Mr. Scullin
and Mr. Lang to efface themselves and
transfer Mr. Forgan Smith to Common-
wealth politics, two Labor factions will
go to the polls again and be beaten sep-
arately.
But if Mr. Lang were half the man
his newspaper pretends he is, “the Great-
est Leader Labor Ever Had” would have
made short work of Mr. Scullin. The
fact that he has failed to shift that poor,
timid little politician shows what a
clumsy fellow he is, even in the domain
of underground engineering, and how
shrewdly Laborites in other States have
sized him up.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Cut Out the Crawling!
The arrival in Sydney of another large
subsidised American tourist steamer was
characterised by the now-familiar exhi-
bitions of grovelling on the part of news-
papers, politicians and Bumbles. In
Maoriland the trippers were joined by
Kingsford Smith, who in paying his
passage-money presumably handed the
Americans engaged in driving British
shipping off the Pacific portion of the
very handsome present he recently re-
ceived from the Commonwealth. The
public expects a different sort of prefer-
ence from this distinguished Australian,
who would be justly annoyed if Austra-
lians travelled by a heavily subsidised
foreign air line in competition with a
passenger service of his own.
Newspaper reporters and photo-
graphers swarmed down to the liner when
it arrived. Even the “Labor Daily”
broke into a rash of pictures, one of
which depicted young women gathered
round the binnacle with the captain. The
scribes sought out citizens of the Middle
West who have travelled in 78 countries
and have luggage labels to prove it.
These latter are always interviewed at
length, and are given civic receptions at
which they forget all about gangsters and
depression and ignore the fact that the
U.S.A. still has twice as many unem-
ployed as there are people in Australia,
and that their country has only just now
reached the blessed state in which it is
able to rejoice over the abolition of child
labor. Their memories seem to contain
nothing but facts about the glory of
Mr. Roosevelt and the pre-eminence of
their country.
Nobody blames them for this or for
feeling superior in the consciousness that
they can be so flattered above other tour-
ists, especially by a country whose
nationals are sometimes received in the
U.S.A. in a manner which makes them
wonder whether they have fallen into the
hands of the Spanish Inquisition.
The U.S.A. spends as little as it can in
Australia and sells a great deal. Its wool-
buying here has dwindled to nothing.
Its Secretary of Agriculture threatened to
ruin our wheat-farmers by dumping grain
against them in Asia “at the price of
dirt.!’ While white Americans are free to
migrate to Australia, Australians seeking
admission to the U.S.A. are limited to a
few score per year. And where prohibi-
tive duties are not clapped on Australian
produce fantastic limitations are pro-
posed—witness the restrictions on imports
of our wines. Yet these journalists, poli-
ticians and aldermen fawn on visitors
from a country which treats their own
country so badly.
By all means let Australia cultivate
friendly relations with the U.S.A., but
there should be give and take. We can be
hospitable to tourists without cringing
to them, and they will go away with a
better opinion of Australians and Aus-
tralia if those who press attentions on
them give up behaving like yokels in the
presence of Squire. Frank friendship
between the peoples can be built only
on a foundation of mutual self-respect
and equality of rights and treatment.

The Major Is Amused.
Two impressions of “The Millennium
Arrives,” here published on January 31.
One is signed by H. W. Wilson, who
writes from Wynnum, Queensland:
I have been an ardent admirer and a regular
subscriber to your journal for the last 12 years,
and for another 12 (in the bush and at the
war) whenever I could get it.
I have been so disgusted, however, at your
attitude to Douglas social credit, and especi-
ally to what I consider the grossly unfair and
misleading article, that I have instructed my
newsagent to cancel my order. It may interest
you to know that in my small circle I have
heard of nearly 20 D.S. Crediters who have
given up the “Courier-Mail.” The fault of
that paper is not so much that they have
written anything unfair, but that they have
pursued a policy of silence.
The other comes from J. H. Davis,
who is accompanying Major Douglas on
his tour of these parts. It is written on
official letter-paper, below the printed
wordls “C. H. Douglas, 8 Fig Tree Court,
Temple, E.C.4, London,” and “Fifth
Floor, ‘Evening Post’ Building, Welling-
ton, C. 1.”
We have just seen your issue of January 31,
in which you have treated us so nicely. Our
best thanks for making the subject “front-page
stuff.”
After dinner with Mrs. Douglas in the
lounge of our hotel, with glee bordering on
hilarity we all three in our turn read “The
Millennium Arrives.” The Major passed the
politicians at ninepence a gross, although any
time he gets serious he can prove that they
are not to blame. Goannas are new to him.
Australia is better off than he thought.
We are so tickled with this delightful bit of
writing that we want all our friends to enjoy
it. If it would not be asking too much, may
we tell the editors of the “New Economics
(Melbourne), “New Era” (Sydney) and “New
Age” (London) that they may reprint the story,
with the usual acknowledgments?
We shall have this address until Feb. 28
Major Douglas leaves for Canada early in
March.
So the Major has tolerance and a
sense of humor. It is a pity so many of
his Australian followers are lacking in
both.

Provincialists at Melbourne.
In matters of government our greatest
need is the effecting of a complete separa-
tion between the spheres of the Common-
wealth and the States, so that there may
be no more shackling of the national
authority in national matters, no more
overlapping and predatory taxation,
which impedes the development of in-
dustries able to stand on their own feet,
and no excuse for Premiers to converge
on Melbourne every few months with an
army of Cabinet Ministers and officials.
The position patently calls for conces-
sions on both sides: a surrender of
revenue on the part of the Common-
wealth, and a surrender of powers on the
part of the States. It was hoped that
this would be realised by at least some
of the worthies now assembled in Meb
bourne, and that proposals for clarifying
the situation will be put forward ; but
the optimists were soon disillusioned.
A sure way of buying financial trouble
is for one authority to raise money and
hand it over to another to spend. Aus-
tralia has tried this in the matters of the
soldier-settlements, the Federal-aid roads
and the wheat bounties, among others,
and the results have been uniformly bad.
Yet Butler, of South Australia, went to
the conference with a plan for a vast
extension of this idiotic system. He pro-
posed that “50 p.c. of the customs and
excise duties collected by the Common-
wealth should revert each year to the
States.” This was too much for even his
fellow-Premiers with provincial minds, so
the man from Adelaide produced a second
plan, i.e., that “the Commonwealth should
take over sufficient debts to relieve the
States of interest payments totalling
£7,500,000.” Westralia’s Collier also
wanted relief from interest on loans,
specifically “loans invested in public
works not now returning interest.”
The Victorian Government had the
hide to suggest that the Commonwealth,
which has to find 18 millions per annum
for pensions alone, besides bearing the
whole burden of defence expenditure—
which, as everyone but imbeciles knows,
will have to be largely increased —should
retire altogether from the income-tax
field. The N. S. Wales Premier said he
would be satisfied if the Commonwealth
handed over to the States the proceeds of
its special tax on property income, a
greater share of the petrol tax and three-
fifths of whatever war-debt concessions
it may receive.
It is due to Mr. Stevens to say that
he was the only Premier who showed an
appreciation of the necessity for a re-
distribution of powers that will serve the
nation by strengthening the Common-
wealth without weakening the principle
of local self-government. Oddly enough,
he was the sole dissentient when it was
moved that, “unless unification is to be
adopted as the ultimate goal, amendment
of the Commonwealth Constitution is
necessary... .to secure to the States
financial resources adequate to the proper
discharge of their functions.”
Amendment of the Constitution is
necessary, but it should be comprehen-
sive and final. Since five of the seven
Governments are in no mood for reason-
able negotiation, the Commonwealth
Government should consult the people—
refer the whole question of constitutional
and financial reform to them. These are
questions that might be put:
Are you in favor of giving the Common-
wealth Parliament power to make laws, with-
out limitation, , with respect to—
(1) Trade and commerce;
(2) Corporations;
(3) Industrial matters;
(4) The admission of new States;
(5) The imposition and collection of one
income tax for Australia; .
(6) The surrender to the States of death duties
and taxation of land—except land in the Fed-
eral Territory;
(7) The assumption by the Commonwealth
of control of and financial responsibility for
the State Government railways, and—
(B) The State education systems.
The five Premiers want a Common-
wealth referendum. Let us have a good
one while we are about it.
The Coalminers’ Money.
Membership of the N. S. Wales A.L.P.
can be a costly privilege, especially when
leading comrades quarrel and go to law.
Delegates from the northern coalminers
reminded the Sydney conference that their
union had lent the A.L.P. executive £4OOO
to finance the ballot-box libel action, and
plaintively mentioned that they would
like something on account for its multi-
tude of workless members. Graves, the
secretary, pointed out that he had sent
the miners £750, the proceeds of a levy
on A.L.P. members which “had created
such dissatisfaction that it would be un-
wise to impose further levies at the
moment.” The party itself had been
“involved in huge expense in connection
with the case.”
In legal costs alone we paid over £l6OO,
exclusive of money spent in literature and other
matters. In addition the “Labor Daily” ex-
pended hundreds of pounds.
The miners have been assured that “the
movement” will regard the debt of £3250
as “a moral obligation.” In short, they
can’t get their money, and they haven’t
even the satisfaction of feeling that the
litigant for whom they found it will keep
reminding “the movement” of its “moral
obligation.” Willis, who lost the case, and
Bailey, who won it and got the damages,
now sit cheek by jowl in the rival Labor
organisation.

Migration and Employment.
P. H. Goldfinch, general manager of
the C.S.R. and chairman of the British
Settlers’ Welfare League, wrote sound
sense about immigration the other day.
He says that, while nobody in his senses
can fail to see the need for increasing
population, the unemployment problem
must first be dealt with.
Three conditions are involved, Mr.
Goldfinch declares, in dealing with this
problem and subsequent populative ex-
pansion—the unlocking of land ; enter-
prise, in which he says the Australian is
rich by nature, and markets. He thinks
markets the best starting point for any
scheme to develop population.
It is the logical one. Half the troubles
of the British Empire come through its
finding work for foreigners. Let Aus-
tralia create a demand for goods equal
to that which reigns perennially for wool
and gold and finance their production.
Then the end of her unemployment
troubles will soon arrive, and any fresh
population which is wanted to cope with
expansion will be found without boom-
ing or ballyhoo.
Governments, however, fail to realise
this, as a general rule. Their idea of
“settlement” is to pitch a lot of help-
less families into a group area, set them
to grow something which the local poli-
tician or agricultural expert thinks will
flourish and then find a theoretical
market for it by shouting at some poten-
tial consumer “Hey! Here’s a bit of
the best wheat [or whatever it may be]
in the world!” irrespective of whether
there is a demand for it or not.
The fate of the British settlers in Vic-
toria should have taught Australia a
lesson in immigration methods. It was
the apex of a whole pyramid of bad
advertisements which Australia has re-
ceived through the intrusion of politics
and publicity men into colonising work.

Alien Shell-poachers.
This from an unquestioned authority on
the Strait and Aru pearling industry:
The reports regarding the Japanese sampan
intruders are not mere sensation. The invasion
is a real menace, present in northern waters for
some years. It has become far more frequent
during the past year or two.
These mysterious vessels openly defy the
Australian quarantine, immigration, customs
and fishing laws. About 12 months ago one
of them, when passing Thursday Island on its
way south, was approached by the local
Customs launch, but, instead of answering the
latter’s signals and stopping, increased her
speed and was soon out of sight on its way
down the N. Queensland coast, where it was
later seen several times about the various
reefs.
Five or six weeks later this same vessel was
sighted leisurely passing T.I. on its return trip
north, and again was approached by the local
Customs launch. This time it allowed the
latter to get alongside her and was brought
into T.I. harbor.
The vessel proved to be 110 ft. long, pro-
pelled by Diesel engines. It had aboard 42
Japanese and about half a dozen canoe-like
vessels each about 20ft. long, also several tons
of trocfms shell. This is known to have been
fished from Denham Pass, which lies about 15
miles s.-e. of Cape York between the Barrier
Reef and Queensland coast.
The Customs Department prosecuted the
captain for refusing to answer signals and for
not stopping when passing southward. The
man was fined £10 —a farce and an invitation
to similar vessels to frequent these waters.
No other charge was brought against him.
The Queensland Fisheries Department would
not act.
The sampan was allowed to lie alongside
Thursday Island whart overnight, quite un-
guarded, while the 42 members of its crew
had absolutely free access to and from shore.
Yet all-British ships berthed here or elsewhere
are invariably carefully guarded day and night
by the Customs, and British passengers have all
belongings thoroughly searched by those officials
before being allowed to take them ashore.
Apart from the fact that the country’s, health
is endangered by crews landing without medical
inspection on our islands and coastline, the in-
trusions of these vessels are very serious for
Queensland shellers, whose produce has to com-
pete with that of the poachers in the overseas
markets. Shellers pay heavy customs duties on
imported gear and stores used in their fleets,
also income tax and Federal and State fishing-
license fees. They buy Australian material for
boatbuilding and repairs.
The poachers escape all local burdens and
fish the same , grounds as T.I. shellers. Dis-
aster stares the Australian concerns in the face
unless they can brin? costs down to a com-
petitive basis.
As I write three mysterious vessels have
been seen near T.I. within two weeks. One
of them, having been disturbed in a narrow
adjacent passage by a launch returning to T. 1.,
made its way through Thursday Island harbor
during heavy rain. These vessels are white-
anting the Pacific. They have been reported
from Darwin coast, Mandated Territory and
Solomon Islands to as far south as Fiji, ana
my opinion is they will increase in numbers as
time goes on.
It is known that prohibited immigrants have
been landed in the vicinity of T.I. from mys-
terious vessels in recent years. To my personal
knowledge the bones of three of these vessels
have been found on adjacent beaches.
Isn’t it time the Commonwealth and Queens-
land Governments woke up?

Function of an Army.
“J.D.”: No doubt many Parisians “go
on with their marketing, their bocks and
aperitifs” (B. 14/2/’34) when there is
trouble in Paris. They also do it when
there is trouble in the provinces, and
there mostly is these hard-up days. Last
week
The worst disorder occurred in Marseilles.
Both sides used revolvers, and in the evening
mobs looted shops along the Cannebiere.
Also there were "’‘minor riots in the
Channel ports.” Fashionable Pau is a
Red stronghold. So is Vichy. Both are
continually threatened with disorder.
There are dozens of places up and down
France where anything might happen
with the right provocation —a coal crisis
or a rise in food prices, for example.
Paris is, of course, western Europe’s
headquarters of Bolshevism, and it always
must be. It is a magnet for adventurers
of every race and color, and Russians
and Germans have been trying to upset
its peace and good government for the
past 15 years. It possesses a “Red Belt”
of 320,000 electors, who habitually vote
Communist.
That France doesn’t have repeated
revolutions after the bloody and ruinous
South American model is not for lack of
trying on the part of its Communist
Parliamentarians. When I was in Paris a
few years ago Marcel Cachin, of
“L’Humanite,” had just been sent to the
Sante prison for trying to corrupt the
Navy. Vaillant-Couturier joined him
shortly afterwards for an article in “La
Caserne” calling on the soldiers to
mutiny. Duclos, another Deputy, had
been sentenced to 30 years for a series
of similar offences. (Incidentally, he was
returned at the top of the poll in his over-
whelmingly Red constituency while in
gaol, so the Government amnestied him.)
Almost every May Day Paris stages
the same little drama. A transport strike
is ordered by the Communists. Cavalry-
men patrol the streets. Aeroplanes signal
crowd movements to infantry officers,
whose men are tactfully hidden in rid-
ing schools and the like. The middle-
aged gentlemen referred to by The Bul-
letin continue to sit placidly in the
cafes. There is no rioting. This isn’t
because there are not hundreds of thou-
sands ready and eager to riot. The 40,000
Communists whom Blum led to the
Place de la Nation last week didn’t stop
there according to plan, or because they
wanted to ; they stopped because they
were afraid to go on. Only one thing has
kept Paris and the provinces peaceful
since the Armistice ; realisation on the
part of would-be trouble-makers that
there is a disciplined army in the back-
ground.
It is becoming the function of most
armies not so much to fight abroad as
to keep the peace at home. Britain
relied largely on volunteers in the Boer
War, and its regulars were chiefly used
for instructional purposes after the first
year of the World War. It has never
had a revolution, or even riots on a
serious scale, since the passing of the
Army Act, because that Act led to the
creation of an intensively trained national
army—-smaller than the army of any
other Power, but harder to corrupt
than any other. Some day an Aus-
tralian capital will experience, on a
proportionately more dreadful scale, what
Kalgoorlie went through the other day.
The world’s verdict will be: “Of course.
For years Australia has been the only
civilised country without a national
army.”


Society
"AND ITS PRINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Maths.”: Only the initiate know what
queer tricks can be played with figures
properly juggled. An ancient friend
who, among his other activities, has de-
vised a system to beat the roulette tables
at Monte Carlo gave me this one the
other day. He served in the Zulu War
of 1880-01. Adding the separate figures
1,8, 8, 1 to 1881, he got the year of the
Boer War, which began in 1899. This
lasted three years, ending in 1902. To
that add the figures 1,9, 0,2, and you
get the year of the big smash —1914.
That ended in 1918. Again add to that
the separate figures 1,9, 1,8, and you
get 1937, when we are evidently due for
the next dust-up.
“I shouldn’t care to be the second husband of any widow”

“Maltworm”: After years of inten-
sive research, mostly personally con-
ducted, I have been tabulating the results
of my inquiries into the colloquial names
of the various containers in which beer
is served. These differ curiously in every
State. In Brisbane, a standard pint
served in a long glass is a “schooner.”
Few Sydney Hebes or Ganymedes know
enough to spring to the request with the
right article—the drink there is a “pot”
or a “mug.” In Adelaide the super-
thirsty shopper asks for a “butcher,” and
in Westralia for a “jack” as likely as not.
In Melbourne “bucket” is in favor with
those disdaining to ask for a “tin” or a
“can.” But Melbourne is distinguished
"by one measure peculiar to itself, as far
as the writer knows. This is a thin glass
holding a quart which is affectionately
referred to by its intimates as a “dread-
nought.”

“Aerodrome”: The story of the lady
who put benzine in the primus (B.
31/1/ ’34) recalls an evening in Egypt
after the Evacuation when a batman
came to the tent shared by myself and
a mate bearing proudly what he said
was a tin of kerosene pinched from
the near-by A.S.C. depot. The kerosene
issue in those days was scanty, and most
of it went to the mess and the regimental
staff. At dusk we sent our lad out to
buy a couple of small glass lamps from
the Greek storekeeper over the road;
after they were filled each of us lit one
simultaneously. The blaze which fol-
lowed burned the tent and all our be-
longings to cinders and deprived both
of us of eyebrows and eyelashes. The
hardest cut came from the court of in-
quiry held to consider our claim for lost
kit. Right off the president asked in
an ugly voice how we came by the
special armored-car spirit which had
caused the trouble.
* * * *
“Oran”: Cutting the eyelashes is not
a trick confined to dusky races (B.
14/2/’34). There is an old Irish custom
which decrees that a baby shall begin the
quest for beauty early, and to help it
along the nurses clip the child’s lashes
periodically until they consider a good
growth is assured. I watched an old
Irish nurse clip her charge’s eyelashes
one morning and learned that the best
time to give the beauty treatment is at
the full of the moon.
* * * *
“Alea Jacta”: There was a protest at
the A.L.P. conference in Sydney at the
action of a returning officer who, when
two candidates had run a dead-heat in the
voting for a place on the executive, spun
up a penny to decide the issue. “That
sort of thing,” declared the loser hotly,
“is dragging the Labor movement down,”
but conference decided that the return-
ing officer was within his rights. Actually,
it happens occasionally in contests for
more exalted positions. A few -years
ago, when John W. Kirwan and
Jimmy Cornell tied in the voting for the
Chairmanship of Committees in the West-
ralian Leg. Council, the President sug-
gested that they should draw straws for
the prize. Kirwan secured the longer
one and the bacon therewith, so Jimmy
was made Deputy-Chairman. When Kir-
wan in course of time succeeded to the
Presidency of the Chamber, Cornell, too,
moved up a step ; and the other day, in
Kirwan’s absence overseas, he was
appointed acting President.

“Stumer”: A quaint incident preceded
the drawing of a recent Queensland lot-
tery. A customer applied for a ticket,
forwarding his
cheque for the
amount, and, in
the casual Queens-
land fashion, the
brief was sent to
him. When the
cheque was re-
turned by a heart-
less bank the lot-
tery management
wrote the drawer,
inviting him to
make good or re-
turn the ticket. He
refused to do
either. It was then
announced that
the number of his
ticket would be re-
garded as non-
existent and dis-
qualified from
drawing any prize
if it turned up. At
the drawing the
spectators were
duly warned to this
effe c t, but the
number accommo-
datingly stayed in
the machine.

busy thoroughfares. He casts an anchor

“Nakhoda”: The 8.8. C. in England
periodically issues circulars informing lis-
teners how words ought to be pro-
nounced, and in a recent list occurred the
word “Labuan.” The pronunciation com-
mittee, which includes Shaw, Forbes-
Robertson and Prof. Lascelles Aber-
crombie, directed that the word should
be pronounced “Lab-00-an.” Labuan is
a tiny speck off the coast of Borneo on
which it was my fate to spend several
years’ perdition. The average Britisher
isn’t likely to come in contact with the
word once in a lifetime, so the committee
is terribly conscientious—and inaccurate.
» would b t ? impossible to phoneti-
cise exactly the sound of the word as it

eating islander, but “L’bwahn” is pretty
near it. I wonder how these immortals
would pronounce the name of China’s
leading river. “Yangseekiyang” is good
enough for ordinary purposes but it
wouldn’t be understood by a peasant liv-
ing on that waterway.
* * * *
“Moana-roa”: Quick-thinking in pub
raids (B. 17/l/’34)? A M.L. hostelry
was invaded after hours. Emerging from
a room on the lower floor, a small man
carrying a handbag turned and spoke over
his shoulder. “I shall call again in the
morning,” he said crisply ; “till then con-
tinue the present treatment. If there’s
any change for the worse ring me at
once.” Then he walked casually past the
police on his way out. “Good night,
doctor,” said the sergeant cheerfully.
“Good night,” responded the little chap
with the handbag. But once outside he
went like a scalded cat to where a cobber
and a car were waiting round the corner.
“Phew,” gasped the bogus medico. “I’ve
got the beer, but I was damn near
pinched! ”

“Butler Once” : His Grace the Duke
was a very austere man. He didn’t enter-
tain, and was a teetotaller —even his
water had to be boiled three times —
and I only saw the key of his cellar twice.
On the second occasion his Grace
was suffering from his heart —uncon-
scious, in fact—and the doctor —Sir
Plumphard Sploshberry—said “Is there a
drop of brandy in the house?” Well, I
couldn’t see my employer die like a dog,
so I hopped down to the cellar and
opened it (I had taken a soap impression
of that key first time I saw it) and
explored to see what was left. There
was nothing but some bottled Bass laid
down by the Duke’s great-grandfather, so
I soaked off the label and took it to the
sick-room. Sir Plumphard opened the
bottle himself, sniffed the contents and
drank a teaspoonful. “Not brandy,” he
remarked, “but it may serve to preserve
life.” Whereupon he gave the Duke a
taste. The Duke sat up. “Sploshberry,” he
said, “give me another blot outa that
spottle. And give Jenkins a slot, too. And
have a stop yourself.” The doctor obeyed
instructions ; after that I have no distinct
recollection save that we went down, his
Grace and myself, and saw Sir Plump-
hard into his Rolls, pressing upon him
six bottles, two of which he dropped. I
think it was two days later that the Duke
and Sir Plumphard (attended by stern-
looking chauffeurs) put me on a one-
class ship sailing for Sydney. “Jenkins,”
said his Grace mournfully as he shook
my hand at the gangway, “this is worth
£2OO a year to you so long as you stay
out of England and keep your mouth
shut.” The demise of his Grace at the
age of 99 came as a great shock to me.
NEWS OF THE WEEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wool’s turned the corner, experts count,
Though still our wheat the silos gluts;
Prince George has climbed up Table Mount
With indefatigable Smuts;
Gold holds its own; the minted pound
Maintains the forty-shilling grade;
Stan Bruce is for Australia bound —
And Bradman goes to Adelaide.
France, torn with faction- —riots, too —
Faces a future dark with dread;
On Irish greens shirts tend to blue;
Vienna’s streets with blood run red;
The Russian bear defies Japan;
Tokio answers “Who’s afraid?”
In Melbourne Premiers scheme and plan—
And Bradman’s off to Adelaide.
Since Uncle Sam has labelled lush
A beverage no more accurst,
Our own Australia joins the rush
To damp his clay and slake his thirst.
Byrd looks to reach th’ Antarctic Pole;
Jack Lang may Canberra invade;
Grim Everest is others’ goal—
But Bradman fancies Adelaide.
Strong men there’ll be their teeth who’ll gnash
To hear the news, and tell you straight
They’d trouble less should empires crash
And dynasties disintegrate.
At Doom the exiled Kaiser’s legs
Through peaceful tulip-beds parade;
And Bradman’s pegs, as sure as eggs,
Are going down in Adelaide.
What dire bereavement next we’ll rue,
What empty chair, who knows? Not I.
Will Lindrum head for Timbuctoo
Or Crawford home in Peckham Rye?
Ah! break it gently on The Hill,
Where lusty barrackers blockade
Opposing teams with comments shrill.
Whom will they find his place to fill
Now Bradman’s off to Adelaide?

“Sol. Merri”: The story of Clemen-
ceau’s comment on Wilson’s fourteen
points (B. 7/2/’34) reminds me of the
occasion when the Tiger’s devoted W. M.
Hughes addressed a jumbled assembly of
generals and Diggers in Charleroi shortly
after the Armistice broke out. Billy,
after mentioning how high he would hang
the Kaiser, proceeded: and as for
President Wilson and his fourteen points,
well, I don’t know what he means, you
don’t know what he means, he doesn’t

by Private Bluey Smith with a heartfelt
“Gawd knows!” The laughter drowned

“Nakhoda”: Since the death of Mrs.

much-changed individual. The slim

the resolute old lady cast him. He
disconcerted her by confessing a prefer-
ence for golf, tennis and afternoon-tea
with the ladies. He now disclaims any

further idea of teaching mankind to pre-
pare itself for the life hereafter, and an-
nounces that his mission is to teach it how
to make the best of this world. He will
find this a much more crowded profes-
sion than his original one, what with the
growing army of moral reformers, up-
lifters, popular psychologists, economists
and politicians. If Krishna, wants to
found a movement he will have to put
himself at the head of the Communists,
the Douglasites, the Nationalists, the
Langites, the anti-Langites, the Fascists
or some such band of architects of terres-
trial Utopias, otherwise he is destined to
sink into oblivion. All the key positions
are already in the hands of Messiahs,
who are not going to give up their

“Chev.”: How many railway pas-
sengers feel a thrill when they navigate
the covered way between carriages? I
have never conquered the feeling that the
shaky contraption might part, and this
actually happened on a train near Mel-
bourne the other day, a traveller dropping
to the permanent way. He was picked up
plus a few bruises and continued his
journey in the same train.

“Ike Hollar”: A Sydney newspaper,
recording the exhumation for return to
their native land of a number of ten-
years-deceased Chinese, mentions that
sovereigns were found in the coffins, and
that burial of gold coins along with the
dead is part of the Chinese religion. I have
an idea that silver and even copper answer
the purpose equally well. Coins are placed
in a Chinese coffin as largesse to grasp-
ing evil spirits who might otherwise inter-
fere with the repose of the departed, but
it was customary to regard such devils
as being much too ignorant to detect
the difference between different grades
of minted coins. For that reason half-
pennies and even farthings were regarded
as perfectly adequate for the purpose.
Only in the case of a particularly
esteemed Chinaman would his friends
plank down more. The yarn is told of one
sophisticated Celestial who, having totted
up the amount of these gifts, added £5
on his own account, swept the coins into
his pocket, and placed a cheque for the
total on the coffin lid.
* * * *
“Sach”: The cables tell of an oil-
tanker sailing from England with the
crew consisting entirely of master
mariners, grim evidence of the depres-
sion in shipping. In Melbourne in 1926,
when the Huddart Parker freighter
Werribee was being sent overseas to be
sold, there were 400 applications for 45
vacancies, and when she sailed every man
of the crew held a master’s ticket. The
trip was from Melbourne to England
and pay off there.
* * * *
“Sister”: In the early morning I went
out from the Thursday Island Hospital to
gather the blossom from a faery-tree on
the rise above ; out of one lovely creamy-
pink flower buzzed a wasp and stung me
on the nose. I rushed into the kitchen and
old Ahmat, the Malay cook, caught up
a blue bag and dabbed it round the sting.
Later I sat in the office taking particulars
of the out-patients, Japanese, Chinese,
Islanders. At nine to the strike Sergeant
Jansen marched his sick men down from
barracks, and lined them up before me.
For 20 minutes I wrote their details:
thenin strode the doctor. He looked at
me in amazement. “What is it?” he
bellowed. Then I remembered, and
looked in the glass near by. My face and
cap and collar were blued all over. And
not one of those fine soldier-men had
given the slightest indication of seeing my
plight.
"If I had my way I would never ride in these beastly trams, but pa says we ought
to help the Government all we can.”
“Chevroford”: A Melbourne barrister
suggested to a Judge that he was
not competent to adjudicate on motor-car
driving offences unless he drove a
motor-car. ’Sonah properly inquired
“Why?” If the principle were applied
comprehensively a Bench of chemists
would be required to deal with a
gas-explosion case, and Judges would
have to take a course of tram-driving
before they could come to a sound de-
cision about a street accident. In the
case in question the motorist charged
admitted that he had driven out of a
side street, and, finding a car blocking
his way, “gave it a go” and incidentally
hit a girl. ’Sonah decided he had learnt
enough about the circumstances, although
he fortunately didn’t drive a car.
* * * *
“B-scale”: Is adversity killing the
toiler’s sense of humor? On a relief job
in Sydney a young man, sun-tanned
to chocolate color, turned out clad only
in shorts and boots, and as the tempera-
ture climbed into the nineties he
was envied by his fellows who
sweltered in flannel and tweed.
At lunch-time, however, the
“job committee” told him his
garb wouldn’t do. He pointed
out that, as he was a fisherman
when he wasn’t doing relief
work, he considered he was
actually overdressed to the extent of his
boots. “You are lowering the standard
of living,” he was informed. “Next
thing, the bosses will be saying the
worker doesn’t need a shirt to work in.”
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: I saw a picture the
other day on the horrors of the French
Foreign Legion, and it set me wonder-
ing why Hollywood doesn’t obtain a
story from one of the few fortunate
escapees from the North Australian
police. I am one. I have hitherto kept
the story to myself for fear of reprisals,
for the force has a long arm. My ser-
geant used regularly to improve his re-
volver practice by tying me up to a gum-
tree before breakfast and making an
outline sketch of me with bullet holes. The
chip in my left ear records the occasion
when he was more than ordinarily drunk.
For not polishing our boots we used to
be pegged out on antheaps, buried up to
the neck in the desert sand or sent for a
ride on a wild buffalo, like a well-known
historical figure whose name for the
moment escapes me. The death penalty
took various forms, but the one favored
by my sergeant was tying the condemned
man’s extremities to brumbies, which
were stampeded at the word of command.
The question might be asked why
we stood it, but we were mostly hard
cases who recognised that discipline was
essential under the rigorous conditions of
desert warfare against hordes of armed
and ferocious blacks. I escaped by kill-
ing my sergeant and walking 1000 miles
over the burning sands to the Gulf
of Carpentaria, whence I swam under
an assumed name to Port Moresby. I
am now living in retirement in Mel-
bourne.
* * * *
“Vitellins”: It is a sort of tradition in
English-speaking countries, and possibly
other ones, that a condemned murderer
may have what he likes for his last break-
fast on earth. Possibly few avail them-
selves of the privilege to any extent, or
sit down to the meal with a really keen
and vigorous appetite, but there are ex-
ceptions. Brown, who was hanged with
his mate Kennedy in 1928 for the brutal
murder of a constable on a lonely
country road, was one. He consumed a
pound of steak and several eggs before
facing the hangman, and English papers
found therein the final proof of the ruf-
fian’s callousness. But Brown’s feat, such
as it was, sinks into utter insignificance
beside the achievement of a huge Texas
negro who figured in a recent cable for
his abilities as a trencherman in the very
shadow of death. This amazing coon
polished off 21b. of sirloin steak, 21b. of
ham, 12 fried eggs, two chocolate pies,
dozens of biscuits and a few other odds
and ends, including two quarts of ice-
cream. It just shows that America can
still lead the world—and the Ethiop run
rings round the Caucasian —in some
physical activities of the human frame.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: A bull entered a china shop
in a Melbourne suburb recently. The be-
wildered beast charged through the plate-
glass window, cavorted wildly round in
a replica of a bedroom for the newly-mar-
ried, complete with cushions, bedspreads,
curtains and ornamental hardware,
barged through a show case, and finally
emerged by the way he came to rejoin
a mob on its funeral march to the abat-
toirs. Unlike the animal of the meta-
phor, he didn’t break a single article of
china.
* * * *
“Wilfremon”: A deeply religious friend
of mine, on seeing, a copy of Norman
Lindsay’s “Curate in Bohemia” on my
bookshelves, expressed a desire to read it.
He returned it next day, aggrieved with
both the author and myself. He had
thought it, he explained, to be an account
of a one-man mission to foreign parts!
THE QUEST OF THE GOLDEN GIRL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Man, 35, tall, athletic, healthy, public school and
A.I.F. trained, experienced in business, but just now
financially embarrassed, seeks attractive wealthy lady
as partner.”— “Argus” view mat. advt.
He'd knock most sheiks and lady-killers hollow,
Or irom the summary you’d say he might,
A fresh-as-paint if well-matured Apollo,
A hard-as-nails, square-shouldered Julius
Knight.
His mating-call—priced at a bob a line-o!
Rings out as clear as when you flip a glass,
And don’t forget he wants a girl with rhino,
He needs a wife with brass.
The lack of work has left him sunk and
harassed;
He views laborious effort with distaste;
Sooner than stay financially embarrassed
He’s out to be financially embraced.
He’s shrewd, admittedly, but stiff and stony;
He’s done his boodle in, I know not how.
A wild-cat mine, perchance? A nobbled pony?
What does it matter now!
Of single life he tires, our erstwhile Digger;
His object’s an attractive mate to find,
Though one may hazard that the sort of figure
He’ll value most will be the passbook kind.
No telltale wrinkles and no crow’s-foot crimples
Will damp his ardor if she’s that to show.
I doubt he’ll*mind the scarcity of dimples
So long as she’s the dough.
So there you are! Inordinately stupid
It seems, no doubt, at the initial glance,
Enough to knock the stuffing out of Cupid
And strip the gilt—no, glamor—from
Romance.
Yet what’s the use of hollowly pretending?
While this old world of ours through space
shall whirl,
The broken beau, to tacks of brass descending,
Will never slacken in the never-ending
Quest of the golden girl.

POLITICAL POINTS
Some very foolish suggestions have
been made at the Premiers’ conference
in Melbourne. Perhaps the most fool-
ish is that the States should be granted
the power to levy excise. Given that, it
would be only a step to inter-State cus-
toms duties. The municipalities might
receive the right to octroi and toll and
a few more of the local imposts which
make the way of the traveller pocket-
light in Europe. What is needed is a
definite and lasting division of taxes, with
income tax reserved to the Common-
wealth, so that there will be no more
poaching.
Federal Country party’s latest weekly
circular summarises its constitutional-
reform programme, which includes elimi-
nation of overlapping in industry, trade
and finance, uniform company laws for
Australia, an effective inter-State commis-
sion, subdivision of existing States and
the constitutional embodiment of loan
responsibility in the Loan Council, with
one sinking fund for all debts. By no
means a bad programme, but the pro-
ceedings at Melbourne show that the
Cockies will get no support for it from
at least five provincial-minded Premiers.
The old N.S.W. Leg. Council had its
last sitting last week. There were 118
members at the finish, one a lady.; there
will be 60 men and no lady in the new
House. Among the rejects were gentle-
men who punctiliously attended to their
unpaid legislative duties, to the neglect of
their regular callings, if any. Possibly
the State will be asked to compensate
these patriots, unless it can be shown that
they won enough for a new start in busi-
ness —as s.-p. bookmakers, perhaps—by
backing winners of the recent ballot at
£lOO to 6d.
Premier Forgan Smith is fond of sug-
gesting that the British Government could
lighten the burden of overseas interest on
Queensland if it chose. The trouble is
that the British Government did not lend
Queensland the money, and for any
British Government to vary the terms on
which it was borrowed would be so gross
an abuse of power that no British Gov-
ernment could perpetrate it and live.
Butler’s candidate got an awful doing
in the Alexandra by-election. Alexandra
is a three-member district, and in 1933
and 1930 the Libs, had no Labor opposi-
tion. Yet this time their nominee, A. H;
Fraser, though a Digger, was beaten
nearly two to one by George Connor, a
dairyman who stood as an Independent;
in fact, Fraser got little more than one-
fourth of the votes. A singularly poor
showing for the Government which in its
first session had the hide to extend the
term of Parliament (and its own) from
three years to five.
Strange that France, when in need of
a saviour, should turn so persistently to
someone in the seventies. It sum-
moned Clemenceau in 1917 to smash
the-defeatists, and Foch in 1918 to save
the Channel ports. Now it calls upon
Doumergue to preserve it from political
chaos and revolution. In spite of Mr.
Stevens, of N.S.W., it still considers the
old dog best for a hard road.
Douglas, the social credit man, at Wel-
lington (M.L.):
I am not going to waste time explaining how
we should put things right, because at present
we have not got the power to put things right.
A Voice: How do we get the power? That’s
the main part of the address.
Major Dougles: Perhaps the gentleman will
make the address.
That sort of hedging seems to be charac-
teristic of Douglas. Still, he said one
true thing at Wellington—“no finan-
cial system can produce something which
does not exist.” It is a fact which strikes
at the heart of Douglasism.
Resentment at the plague of betting-
shops let loose on South Aus. by Butler’s
Control Board had something to do with
the hiding the Government got in Alex-
andra. About 100 legalised s.-p. joints
have sprung up in Adelaide, and applica-
tions are pouring in from country towns.
Licenses have been issued for all manner
of shops and shacks, garages and halls
(in some of these church services used
to be held), and to all sorts of people ;
nor is there any sex disqualification: a
lady has one for “a shop opposite a
post office.” Adelaide fears that “Adel-
aide for Culture” may be altered to
“Adelaide for Vultures,” and feels that
Butler has let it down.
After two nights of fierce rioting, dur-
ing which two men were done to death,
scores of shops, dwellings, clubs and
hotels were looted and fired, and hun-
dreds of homeless people fled to the bush,
Kalgoorlie turned to the leader page of
its morning newspaper to see what that
eminent organ had to say about it all.
It found its “Miner” wholly concerned
with the worries of the wheatgrowers.
“Mr. J. F. O’Reilly (Hairdressers) asked the Lang A.L.P. conference to help Mr.
Piddington, now in London, in his fight against the new N.S.W. Leg. Council, and proposed
the appointment of a committee to raise funds for the Privy Council appeal. The motion
was callously defeated.”
MR. O’REILLY NOW FEARS THAT IT WILL COME TO THIS.
Kalgoorlie is about 150 miles from the
outer fringe of the wheat belt, but wheat
is no doubt a safe vegetable to discuss
when there are rioters about.
When the Westralian Parliament meets
again it is to consider an address to the
King, petitions to the Lords and Com-
mons and a “report of over 300 pages
setting out the case for secession.” The
report should mention how the secession-
ists propose to defend their 975,000
square miles of country, but 10 to 1 it
won’t. Blarney, the Vic. Police Com-
missioner, who was an A.I.F. general,
has been saying that the Westralians
would be hard put to it to raise a division
and could not possibly make head
against an invader without help. For
the matter of that, they hadn’t sufficient
police in their second city to put down
a drunken mob.
If Australia could be defended by chin-
wagging it could safely leave the job
to Pearce. That Minister was in excel-
lent form in opening the Defence Week
Exhibition in Melbourne and made one
arresting point:
The European situation is dangerous, but all
the European nations except Germany are mem-
bers of the League, and the major ones are
bound by the Locarno pact. The three great
Pacific States, Soviet Russia, Japan and the
U.S.A., are not members of the League.
The speaker closed with a plea for volun-
tary enlistment. It was not so effective
as his former advocacy of national
training.
America’s latest freak religion is Roose-
velt-worship. Worshippers are so numer-
ous and their frenzy is such that they
turned on Lindbergh when that former
god of their idolatry protested in a letter
to the President against the cancellation
of all Government air-mail contracts
because hanky-panky work had been dis-
covered or suspected in some. At this
distance it seems a grossly unfair pro-
ceeding and one that will not induce Aus-
tralians to believe that “Roosevelt is
greater than Lincoln.” It does not require
brains to cancel contracts ; moreover, any
fool with borrowed millions at his dis-
posal can employ large numbers of
people at high rates of wages on public
works. Lots of fools have done it in
Australia.
While Stevens and co. are arranging
to finance the building of heaps of
suburban villas where the commodity is
already oversupplied, the hundreds of
unemployed who have established camps
on waste land have received notice to
quit. Many of them have displayed re-
markable ingenuity in putting together
serviceable homes with scraps of
material, and in growing flowers and
vegetables on sand and stony ground.
Place them on small holdings (“subsis-
tence farms,” as Professor Giblin calls
them) in the country, where they could
get casual work now and then, and they
would very probably do well.
The Austrians have just had a confused
sort of civil war. On one side was the
Christian Socialist party, headed by the
Chancellor, Dollfuss ; on the other, the
Socialist party proper, which was beaten
with heavy loss. The Christian Socialists
were helped by monarchists ; the Social-
ists by Communists. Dollfuss is sup-
ported by Mussolini, and also by the
Pope and the Jews. He is bitterly reviled
by another variety of Socialists, Nazis,
who accuse him of having set up a
“bloody dictatorship” ; by American
newspapers (the N.Y. “Evening Post” de-
scribes him as “doing the dirty work
for Hitler”) and by the British Labor-
Socialist party. The Christian Socialist
gentleman is now expected to turn
Fascist.
Old enemies speak with honeyed
tongues at Sydney meetings of the Fed.
Lab. organisation. Jimmy Catts, who
was M.H.R. for Cook from 1906 till
1922, foregathers with Ted Riley, who
beat him for the seat after Catts had been
expelled the party. Bailey, who had Catts
put out, sits alongside Willis, who had
him thrown to the wolves (Bailey avenged
himself by getting heavy damages from
Willis for libel). Other members are
Coates, who served with Lang in two
Ministries; McDicken, who supported
three Lang Ministries as M.L.A. for Ryde,
and Morgan, who was jockeyed out of
the Langster nomination for Reid. A
common hatred of Langism has brought
them into the one menagerie.
It was recently suggested in Melbourne
that Collingwood’s Labor-controlled
council had made such a mess of things
that a commissioner should be called in.
The council, it was said, was quarrel-
some, extravagant, impecunious and
generally inept. Still, some of its mem-
bers have a fine talent for invective. A
dialogue that brightened a recent debate:
The Mayor to a councillor: “You are a
liar.”
The Councillor: “You are not fit to asso-
ciate with criminals.”
The Mayor: “You have associated with them,
and have gone on to the Bench for them.”
His Washup is a rising hope of what he
calls “the dear old party.”
When the post-war loan boom was be-
ginning and politicians thought that it
would never end, returned soldiers were
put on irrigation blocks to grow Dora-
dilla grapes. There was no market for
half the produce of the vines planted,
but in those days that didn’t matter. It
loomed up as a serious problem when
the vines became fruitful, and one costly
expedient after another had to be de-
vised to keep the Diggers going. Now
the Commonwealth and South Aus. Gov-
ernments have been obliged to promise
£20,000 apiece to enable the settlers to
pull up the Doradilla vines or to graft
profitable varieties on them. Victoria
was also a party to this egregious folly.
Martin, the N. S. Wales Minister of
Justice, in a complacent mood at Hamil-
ton, where a by-election is about to be
held:
When this Government moved into office we
faced an unemployed army of over 200,000
persons. To-day that number is reduced to
less than 90,000, and the decrease still happily
goes on.
Still, the Stevens crowd needn’t take all
the credit. If it grudges any to other
bipeds, it might allow a little to the Aus-
tralian sheep.
From a man in the service:
Girard, the Sydney tramdriver who went to
Russia without leave (B. 7/2/’34), has got his
job back, with certain qualifications. On the
day that the union was to plead his case the
trams were plastered with “demands” for im-
mediate reinstatement. That might have spoiled
everything, but Commissioner Maddocks took
the magnanimous view. He is not popular
among union men, but he has certainly gained
their respect by his verdict.

“El V.”: The death of Albert of Bel-
gium removes one of Europe’s three tall-
est kings—the others are Denmark and
Sweden. Albert was well over six feet and
huge-shoudered, and he walked with a
stride that took some keeping up with.
His family has been catholic in its re-
lationships. His father, a younger son
of old King Leopold 1., never sat on the
throne. His grandfather was Queen
Victoria’s trusted adviser for a time—he
was a Saxe-Coburg, as is King George by
descent on the male side—but he fell from
favor. His mother was a Hohenzollern
of the Sigmaringen branch; his wife,
the much-beloved Princess Elizabeth, a
Bavarian princess, which added greatly
to her troubles during the war. One of
his sisters is married to the Duke de
Vendome, a Bourbon; another to a
Hohenzollern prince. His daughter
wedded a prince of Italy, and his succes-
sor to the throne espoused a Bernadotte
princess of Sweden, descended from
Napoleon’s most diplomatic marshal. The
British Empire loses one of its firmest
friends in the big man, whose shy, rather
short-sighted smile and dauntless look
were familiar to many a Digger during
the war. He was an unassuming person.
“That the King of Belgium!” gasped an
agitated Australian tourist lady when he
was pointed out to her strolling through
the streets of Bruges with a solitary aide-
de-camp. “Why he looks like an Aus-
tralian inspector of police!”
Knight Philip Street, ex-Chief Justice
of N. S. Wales, who has been in Wash-
ington (U.S.A.), is the first Australian to
be appointed by a foreign country to a
judicial position. He is to act as a
member of the permanent Court of Con-
ciliation which is a substitute for war
between the U.S.A. and Greece. The
Court functions when diplomacy fails.
Street, J., is the American selection.
J. T. Brennan, who, as deputy chair-
man, will have a lot to do with Mel-
bourne centenary’s big nautical exhibi-
tion, has gone down to the sea in shipping
offices for 40 years past. Starting with
Huddart, Parkers, he later became
manager in Sydney of the Commonwealth
J. T. BRENNAN, chairman of the Mel-
bourne Overseas Shipping Association.

Melbourne. When the Aberdeen Co.
bought Hughes’s fleet of overseas com-
merce raiders they bought Brennan’s ser-
vices with them. The other day the Mel-
bourne branch of the Overseas Shipping
Reps.’ Association elected him chairman.
If the words which Victor Ryan has
written about the beauties of South Aus-
tralia were placed end to end they would
stretch from Beltana to Bam, and then
twice round the U.S.S.R. For 25 years —
since its foundation —Ryan has been head
of the Government Publicity, Tourist and
Immigration Bureau in Adelaide, and
every- advent of royalty sees him in
charge of secretarial arrangements. He

Prince of Wales and the Duke of York.

he has secretarial control. An 0.8. E.

D. C. Pryce, who has been re-elected
as chairman of the Queensland Cotton
Board, is one of the best all-round
farmers in Australia. As a manager for
the S. A. and I. Company, he came to be
noted as one of the ablest of our dairy
studmasters and a peerless judge of
both Friesians and Illawarras. He is an
experienced wheat-farmer, and in other
branches of agriculture and market-
ing he has to go a long way to match
his own knowledge. Some years ago he
visited America to study the methods of
the Middle West.
“R.J.R.”: Frank Murray “will” not
“be the only member of the Diplomatic
Mission to Japan with even a smattering
of the language” (B. 14/2/’34). Another
missioner is Major E. E. Longfield Lloyd,
M.C., who has made a study of Japan-
ese (and other tongues ; he is head of the
investigation branch of the Attorney-
General’s Department, Sydney). He got
his M.C. in France, following good work
with the First Battalion, A.1.F., at Galli-
poli. After his return as a wounded
Digger in 1916 he took up military in-
telligence work in N.S.W., later serving
as A.D.C. to Sir Dudley de Chair.
“Bundalinga”: My entry in “El V.’s”
quest for the family in Australia which
can span to the roots of the country’s
history with the fewest generations (B.
7/2/’34) is the Faithfull family, of
Springfield station, Goulburn, N.S.W.
William Pitt Faithfull, a young English-
man, took up the station in 1827. His
only surviving son, Augustus Lucian
Faithfull, and one of three living daugh-
ters, Miss Florence Faithfull, are the
present owners of Springfield, represent-
ing two generations spread over 107 years.
A. L. Faithfull first took charge of the
stud in 1871, and has controlled it ever
since—which must be a record in itself.
The Springfield merinos were among the
first to be bred to a plain-bodied standard.
“Fitzwilliam”: My maternal grand-
father, Captain Fearon, was born on
June 3, 1788. He served as a midship-
man under Nelson, and after the collapse
of Napoleon settled near Parramatta. His
youngest daughter, my aunt, was born in
1864, after the old gentleman’s 7Cdi
birthday, and is still going strong. Hence
these two generations span the whole
recorded history of New South Wales,
less four months.
G. Driver will vacate the office of Bris-
bane Divisional Returning Officer early
in March. He has rendered 50 years’
service to the Commonwealth and not a
single day’s sick leave. In 1884 he joined
the correspondence branch of the Cus-
toms Department. When permanent D.R.
officers were appointed for each Com-
monwealth division he was transferred to
the Electoral Department. Healthy long
life seems a family trait. Last year his
mother passed away at 98.
The veteran lawyer Tom O’Halloran
retires after nearly half a century of
practice in Adelaide. He started under
Von Doussa, was with John (afterwards
Judge) Gordon and Nesbit, K.C., and in
time became K.C. himself, and the Tram-
ways Trust’s only legal adviser. Outside
the office he is best known as president
of S.A. Football League.
C. C. Chapman is identified here in
his golfing clothes so that when the
Mayor and aldermen of Yanna Siding
assemble to greet him on his return to

Chapman went to s.-w. Queensland with
sound Maoriland experience a generation
or so ago and took up country which
nobody else wanted. Then he moved to

mining wardens and p.ms. in Queens-
land, has just retired. He joined the
public service in 1886; his first min-
ing connection was when he went to
Mt. Morgan in 1903. Then followed
terms at Childers, Herberton, Charters
Towers and Toowoomba before he be-
came police magistrate in Chillagoe. This
O. E. POWER, P.M., who retires after
long service in Queensland.
was followed by sojourns at Cooktown
and T. 1., which he left in time to take
charge of Clermont during the calamit-
ous flood of 1916-17, when over 50
people were drowned. His final service
was at Rockhampton, so it can be said
without much exaggeration that he
knows Queensland.
C. C. Blazey, who celebrated his fiftieth
year of service with Richmond (Vic.)
Council and is its present Town Clerk,
can remember when the city was infested
with kangaroos and koalas, and when
wild duck could be shot on its lakes.
Since he began his civic career the local
death-rate has declined from 26 io eight
per thousand, and is still going down.
Blazey estimates that he has walked up
the Town Hall steps 960,000 times.
Prominent in the trial of W. H. Baye,
charged with the manslaughter of a boy
who died of tetanus at the Newhaven
Seaside Garden Home (Vic.), was his
counsel, G. A. Maxwell, K.C., M.H.R.
Maxwell has a hawk face and the keenest
of expressions, and few witnesses retain
their composure under his eye. And a
good many of them descend from the
box unaware that their gruelling cross-
examination has been conducted by a
man who is stone-blind. The jury dis-
agreed in Baye’s case, and there is to be
a new trial.
S.A.’s new Export Meat Board starts
with three good men. A. S. Kidman has
had pastoral interests in N.S.W. and
Queensland, and is now a sheepbreeder
in the scrub south of Adelaide. T. Phelps
has always been a butcher, but is on the
accountancy side, and is now manager
of the S.A. branch of Wilcox, Mofflin.
W. A. Jones is president of the Master
Butchers’ Association.
“Jumbuck”: A very gallant gentleman
in W. F. Riley has drafted his last sheep
and said his last kindly word to children,
with whom he was always favorite. W. F.
Riley was a Victorian from the Western
District who went to western Queensland
when bores were few and far between.
Associated with the Chirnsides at Vindex,
“Willie” Riley’s charm made him one of
the most popular sportsmen around
Winton. When drought forced the Rileys
out of Vindex, “Willie” Riley took over
the management of a station near Long-
reach, to later go to a like position at
Saltern Creek for the S.A.I. Co.

The Harbor Bridge, opened in March,
1932, wiped out what used to be the co.’s
chief sources of revenue for over 60 years
-—the Milson’s Point, Lavender Bay and
vehicular ferries. To get out of the diffi-
culty, the board vigorously wrote down
the book value of fixed assets, and accu-
mulated liquids, the public being charged
higher fares for the purpose. Thus, with
a little help from the sale of property, the
co. was able to return no less than
£453,332 of its capital, reducing the figure
to £170,000 in ss. shares. The backbone
of the business is now the Mosman-
Cremorne service.
Last year savings followed the intro-
duction of automatic turnstiles at the
co.’s Circular Quay wharves (whether
such savings are worth while is matter
for argument), but a late summer inter-
fered with week-end takings, and
reduced tram fares affected the Hunter’s
Hill-Lane Cove service. The Wat-
son’s Bay run was discontinued on Aug.
1, but the service as far as Nielsen
Park was resumed later. After providing
for depreciation, etc., the slip in the year’s
net earnings (£4666) was £5804. How-
ever, one of the vessels was converted
from steam to Diesel power, with en-
couraging results, and £l6OB disappeared
from the insurance fund (now £52,071),
while £10,408 was brought from some
safe place. So, after repetition of the
6 p.c. div., shareholders were visibly
£3266 better off than they were at the
previous balance.
To meet competition from the trams,
faster ferries are to be employed. The
board has decided to place orders locally
for three new twin-screwed Diesel vessels,
with a speed of from 13 to 15 knots, and
is negotiating for the purchase of a
water ’bus, of the type used on the River
Thames. It is expected that the new
boats will shorten the journey from
Longueville to the city to 24 minutes.
Also, two of the now-idle but written-off
hulks are to be used on the Zoological
Gardens run next spring.
The board is “confident of being able
to maintain satisfactory dividends.” So
the market prices the scrip at 7s. lOd. as
against 7s. a year ago. At the higher
figure the return is 3.9 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div.
basis. The backing is 6s. lOd. in net
tangibles.
Finances are comfortable enough, not-
withstanding the large return of capital
already referred to:

During the year one of the vehicular
ferries was sold. Still, £5785 net was
added to the book value of ship property,
and £2lBl to plant, etc. To do this and
clip £16,1.17 off the debt, public securi-
ties, etc., were drawn upon for £19,787.
The contraction in the more or less
liquid surplus (£50,198) was £3755. The
shareholding consists of scrip in the
Harbor, Land and Transport Co., which
contributed to the pool. It took over
most of this ferry co.’s land properties
in 1918 for £90,000, which was estimated
to be about two-thirds of their market
value a year later. One of the pup’s
chief revenue producers is the Clifton
Gardens Hotel. There is talk of forma-
tion of another subsidiary to handle
some of the parent co.’s remaining spare
properties, and shareholders may be
asked to come in.

One of the most profitable developments
in connection with modem merchandis-
ing methods has been the evolution of
the chain system in connection with the
sale of low-priced miscellaneous goods.
The foundation on which the system rests
is quick turnover for cash, which necessi-
tates good buying. The aim is to clear most
lines in time to pay the bill and pocket
the profit all within the period allowed
under ordinary trade credit. Also, small
personal service—salesmanship is reduced
to a minimum, there are no deliveries and
few book debts —means low overhead.
Cos. working closely to these principles
have won extraordinary results as turn-
over expanded.
This offshoot of Woolworths, Sydney,
opened two stores in Maoriland in 1929 ;
now there are 10 in the chain, three of
which were added during the last 12
months. After providing for taxation and
depreciation, the year’s net result was
£9610 better at £42,383. Allowing for the
pref. div. (9 p.c.—the 20 p.c. statutory
cut was returned as a bonus), enough
remained to show a luscious 69.7 p.c. on
ord. capital as against 53.8, 30.3 and 28.4
p.c. back to 1930. The div. was kept at
20 p.c., and 10 p.c. was paid on £43,560
of bonus scrip (four for five), issued at
the close of accounts, making the year’s
distribution worth 28 p.c. on capital as
it stood at the beginning of October.
The gift, which raised paid capital to
£148,010 —£50,000 of it is 9 p.c. pref.
money—was provided from a “capital
profits reserve” (£64,410, not treated as
an asset herein), created by giving good-
will a book value of £65,812. The imme-
diate effect of this capitalisation of in-
tangibles will be to give both profits and
divs. a less corpulent look in relation to
capital.
Though outsiders have nearly as much
at risk in the business as shareholders,
there is nothing to worry about in the
finances:

The year’s surplus earnings, a reduction
of £15,677 in debtors’ balances and
£16,512 in cash, etc., enabled the co. to
buy the equity (£12,575) in a freehold at
Wellington, add £46,533 to the book
value of stocks, £20,725 to plant and in-
vest £15,000 in shares in other cos. The
shrinkage in the more or less liquid
surplus (£61,870, including stocks but not
shares) was no more than £19,562.
Last year’s profit was sufficient to pay
the pref. div. and then show over 39 p.c.
on ord. capital as it now stands. The
market therefore prices the pound ords.
at £5, at which figure the return is 4 p.c.
on a 20 p.c. div. basis. The prefs. at
365. 3d. return 4.9 p.c. Excluding £15,687
reserved for depreciation and the capital
reserve already referred to, the net
tangible cover is 50s. Bd. prefs. and

During the five years to the close of
accounts in 1929, profits averaged 17.8
p.c. on capital, and a run of 12} p.c.
divs. was paid. Over the same period
£170,000 of fresh capital was gathered,
raising the total to £250,000, which has
been invested mostly in a string of sub-
sidiaries in the bread- and biscuit-making
and flour-milling businesses. The board,
however, has never told shareholders
much about their investment, the curtain
being kept drawn over the pup’s figures.
The collapse of earnings and the meagre
divs. paid during the three years to the
end of 1932 were largely the outcome
of the price war that led to the supply
of dole bread at 4}d. a loaf less 8 p.c.
discount. Also, the industry in N. S.
Wales is governed by awards which give
inter-State and overseas competitors an
advantage in the export market, chiefly
the South Sea Islands, where Hardman
Bros., the biscuit-making subsidiary, has
strong connections.
Early last year most of those in the
trade agreed to bury the hatchet, and
net earnings sprang £9665, reaching 6.7
p.c. on average capital as against 3 p.c.,
2} p.c. and a loss for the three preceding
years. The div. was lifted from 2} p.c.
to 6 p.c., and £2OOO was added to the
slender reserves, which are labelled
nominal in the table because they are
subject to an unspecified amount of good-
will.
During the year a new subsidiary,
Southern Cross Flour Mills, commenced
operations, and its plant has since worked
to capacity; also, the old-established
business of Hunter’s Bakery, North
Sydney, was bought at an unspecified
figure. The net addition to the book
value of investments, etc., was £48,357: —•

In addition the co. spent £16,999 more
than was written on its own plant, and
added £6743 to the stocks item and
£7692 to debtors’ balances. To do all
this £13,899 of fresh capital was gathered
and £33,912 was added to the debt, while
cash, etc., was drawn upon for £24,204.
When the books closed liabilities ex-
ceeded more or less liquids by £37,841,
a swing of £43,681 over the twelvemonth.
Introduction of the flour tax has
started another price war in the bread
trade, making it impossible to forecast
the co.’s prospects for the current term.
After sales at 245. buyers now offer
225. for the pound shares as against
13s. 9d. a year ago. At 225. the return
would be 5.4 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis.
Subject to intangibles the scrip is covered
by net assets with a book value of 20s. 9d.

This co.’s record of recent years is
enough to make some of its less con-
servative competitors green with envy.
During the rich years of war-time
contracts more was put aside than
was distributed, notwithstanding a cash
bonus of £22,761, sent out with £45,481
of gift scrip in 1919—the unexplained
addition of £30,000 to reserves in 1931
came from a “war-contingency account.”
Substantial additions have since been
made to fixed assets and paid for out
of earnings, and then severely written
down from the same source. The fact
that the works are at Invercargill,
Mataura and Makarewa means that the
co. does not have to compete for stock
in the overcrowded Canterbury markets,
and the figures suggest that either the
management has been extraordinarily
lucky, or that it has been able to forecast
the erratic markets of the last few years
with uncanny precision, or maybe good
luck and good management combined
have contrived to pull the co. through
with scarcely a quiver.
Maoriland’s export price index (1909-
13 = 1000) for meat (it includes lamb
and mutton), which averaged 1827 for
1929, fell to 1087 for December, 1932,
and then rose steadily to 1472 for Decem-
ber, 1933, a spring of 35.4 p.c. over the
last 12 months ; and the strong and per-
sistent rise in the price of wool and pelts
helped, too. The board was thus able
to buy while prices were low and sell
when they were high. After provid-
ing for contingencies, but including
£20,000 dropped from somewhere into
the building reserve (now £45,000), the
net result was nearly five times better
than the previous year’s at 63.1 p.c. on
capital as against 12.7, 12.6, 10, 12.9 and
11.2 p.c. back to 1927. So the div., which
was lifted from 12 p.c. to 13} p.c., was
sweetened with a 25 p.c. cash bonus,
making 384 p.c. in all, and the £27,369
that remained raised reserves visibly
£74,483 higher than paid capital.
The improvement in the year’s results
is further reflected in this pleasing com-
parison of balance-sheet figures:
1924. 1931. 1932. 1933.
Paid capital.. £113,539 £113,547 £113,547 £113,547

Book debts,
cash, invest-
ments, etc. 139,037 177,130 206,042 267,890
To add £32,617 net to the book value of
fixed assets, carry an extra £20,888 of
stocks and a further £61,848 of debtors’
balances, etc., only £57,895 was added
to the debt. Allowing for the final
div. and bonus (together £36,903), the
£26,160 of pref. capital was more than
four and a half times covered by surplus
liquids (£123,581).
The prefs., which enjoy priority as to
capital, advance with the ords. in any
distribution beyond 5 p.c. The market
prices both lots of scrip at 665. as against
365. a year ago. Allowing for the final
div. and bonus, the return at the higher
figure would be 4 p.c. on a 12 p.c. dis-
tribution. The cover for the fully-paid
ords. is 50s. in net tangibles.

Ever since the war-time meat contracts
ran out, and the Argentine got a strangle-
hold on the European market with baby
beef, Australian meat exporters have had
a desperate struggle to make ends meet.
During the 13 years to the close of last
accounts, the co.’s shareholders averaged
only a wink over 1 p.c., and £80,072 had
to be drawn from reserves to pay that
and extinguish trading losses. Still, the
co. managed to hold on to a lot more
cash than it could find employment for
in the business. So ss. per share
(£163,744) was returned during the last
term, reducing paid capital to £491,232 in
654,976 shares of 15s. each. Under
ordinary circumstances this ought to
mean a lift in the dividend rate. But a
contraction of £6534 in net earnings stood
in the way —the rise in the price of frozen
meat, following the Ottawa agreements,
was not sustained —so the div. was kept
at 2} p.c. and reserves had to be tapped
for £406 to pay it. •

Cash and Government securities (now

and debtors’ balances (£78,339) were re-
duced by £5861, while £40,879 was added
to the trade debt and £41,197 to the
stocks item. The year’s shrinkage in
the more or less liquid surplus (£219,068,
including stocks) was £167,380, all but
£3636 of which was on account of
capital returned.
The old Q.M.E., whose capital and re-
serves totalled £369,862, was split in two
in 1915. The pastoral properties were
passed to Australian Stock Breeders, and
the meatworks at Townsville and Bris-
bane were taken over by the present co.
Hopes are that recent experiments will
result in the development of a regular and
expanding trade with Britain in chilled
beef. One problem which threatens to
remain is that of high costs.
At 6s. the fully-paid pound shares re-
turn 8.3 p.c. on a 2} p.c. div. basis. The

John Charles Ludowici set this little
business on its feet 76 years ago. But
it was not until he retired, in 1911, that
the public became interested. The co.’s
record since has been a splendid one.
It has built up and held an export trade
with Asia in belting and the other leather
products it manufactures, and widened
its local connections, despite disturbed
conditions. For 14 years to the close of
accounts in 1929 the div. was kept steady
at 10 p.c. Then the dullness locally and
price recessions and primage on raw
hides from Maoriland affected the figures.
But savings followed an overhaul of
production methods, new lines were intro-
duced, a branch was opened in Mel-
bourne, and net earnings have responded.
Last year the plant was kept fully em-
ployed, and the net result improved
£1229, reaching 7.8 p.c. on capital, com-
pared with 6.3, 1.8, 7.6, 10.7 and 12.2
p.c. back to 1928. The final div. was at

AMICUS CERTUS IN RE INCERTA
One hundred
£5OO policies a day
DURING last year the A.M.P. Society issued new
policies to the value of £15,600,000, equal to an
average of one hundred £5OO policies a working
day. A very large proportion of these policies was
issued to old members desirous of still further safe-
guarding their families and themselves; some evidence,
the Directors suggest, that members appreciate the
security that their membership gives them.
The Society grows in membership and in strength
because, since its foundation in 1849, it has adhered
rigidly to a policy of careful and prudent manage-
ment. It has built up assets to the value of £92,000,000
(all of which belong to the policy-holders), and that
could not have been done unless, down through the
years, sound principles had been maintained and
economical working been the rule.
The Society will be glad to send an experienced
representative to discuss (in strict confidence) the
assurance needs of any citizen, or it will send a copy
of its book, “Investing in Happiness,” to any address.

There is not yet much tangible evi-
dence of the expected boom at Gympie
(Q.). On the Two Mile prospectors have
not produced anything noteworthy to
date, and the shaft, of New Gympie, on
the Great Northern area, is going down
slowly. Here the objectives are reefs
in moderately deep ground, so produc-
tion lies many months ahead. After pre-
liminary surface investigations, Gold
Mines of Australia exercised its options
on areas at the Great Northern, but has
not yet commenced drilling. Operations
on the Inglewood reef itself have been
delayed by arrangements for getting the
needful capital. There has been a run
on alluvial dredging areas along the
Mary River, where systematic boring is
about to commence above Normanby
Bridge. On the southern end, syndicates
working on the Dawn area have not yet
located any large reef. The old Dawn
mine, taken up last year, was worked to
a depth of 630 ft. at least, and up to 1912
it produced about 10,000 oz. of gold. The
ore averaged 14dwt. per ton, with 3dwt.
in the tailings—since recovered.
* * * *
“Millchester”: The proposal to treat
the old tailings dumps at the Towers
(Q.) has been revived. A few years ago
a local crowd decided to tackle the job,
but nothing was done, though tests indi-
cated that the venture would pay its way
with gold at its statutory price, and plant
was available on the field. The latest
move has been made by G. Oswald, a
mining engineer and secretary of Ben-
digo Gold Sands, an Adelaide concern,
which is extracting gold from dumps at
Bendigo. The co. has taken options
over seven or eight of the biggest heaps
at the Towers. These, which contain
some two million tons of dirt, include
the Mills United, Defiance Mill, Bril-
liant Block, New Queen and Brilliant
Extended, all good producers in their
day. The earlier samplings of these
dumps gave an average of about l|dwt.
per ton. Taking one pennyweight as the
extraction unit, there should be 100,000 oz.
of gold in the two million tons of stuff
referred to. Bendigo Gold Sands is now
profitably cyaniding dumps containing 23
grains per ton. Bore samples from the
Towers are to be sent to Adelaide for
analysis.
* * * *
Herberton (N.Q.) mills finished up the
best annual run for many years with
a December output of 279 tons of
ore for 28 tons of black tin, valued
at £4228. The Cornishman, with 6 tons,
Canberra, 3 tons, and Perseverance, 2\
tons, were the best individual producers.
The neighboring Government mill at
Irvinebank is to be run continuously
during 1934 in order to cope with in-
creased ore supplies.

Hawkins Hill, Georgetown (N.Q.), is
one of the most promising shows recently
taken up by the co. of which Cliff Rut-
ledge is general manager. The Hill has
been actively developed by sinking and
driving, the shaft going down 220 ft. on a
reef 3ft. wide. Production to the end of
December was 80 tons, averaging 15dwt.
of gold. Chillagoe smelters are taking
the ore with gratitude, because of the
sulphide content.

A parcel of 11| tons from the Rising
Sun, Tennant’s Creek, Centralia, has been
crushed at the Petersborough Govern-
ment battery (S. Aus.) for 115 oz. of gold,
an average of lOoz. 4dwt. per ton. Thus
far most of the finds at the Creek have
consisted of pockets, disclosed by cutting
the cap of ironstone outcrops. It remains
to be proved whether the lodes and the
gold live at depth.

T. M. Brennan and D. L. Kitto have
pegged a g.-m. lease of about 1000 acres
on Coode Island in the Yarra, near
Melbourne. The island used to be part
of the old river bed. Government geolo-
gist Kenny says that any gold which may
have been deposited there from the hills
is likely to be very fine, and difficult to
recover.

The reconstructed Freney Oil Co.’s
income for the Dec. half of 1933 was
£4O, and expenditure £1521 —the geologi-
cal survey cost £609, salaries and wages
took £340 and sundries £572. The
cash holding amounts to £4418, which
may mean that calls are not far off. Dr.
Wade examined the geological and drill-
ing records of the co. from its inception,
and has inspected an area held in the
Wooramel district, including Peron
Peninsula and Dirk Hartog Island, but
has not yet reported thereon. He will
look at the co.’s Kimberley holdings in
April.

So that the earnings of its again highly
profitable Westralian goldmine shall not
suffer deductions on account of its
other enterprises, Sons of Gwalia has
formed Leonora Corp., Ltd., in London,
with a capital of £200,000 in Is. shares to
take over its outside interests for £87,500
in scrip. Had this been done years ago
Gwalia would have been much better off.
It has frittered away a lot of money in
a Cornish clay pit, which is still a losing
proposition.
* * * *
Hampton Areas, Ltd., is nibbling at
an option over the old White Hope,
situated on one of its blocks, and which,
contrary to the expectations of the late
Herbert Daly, didn’t prove to be “one
of nature’s goldmines.” The co., which
is the third reconstruction of the Hamp-
ton Plains Estate, Ltd., owns nearly
200,000 acres, together with mineral
rights, 22 miles south-east of Kalgoorlie.
At last balance it had about £lO,OOO in
cash and investments.

Wavic Gold Development, Higgins-
ville (W.A.), has reached the crushing
stage. It is working the Two Boys, in
which Dr. Loftus Hill sees a potential
profit of 30s. a ton on roughly 40,000
tons of ore. He reckons that profits
should be earned soon after milling is in
full swing, and has recommended that
portion of the gains be earmarked for
further development. Higginsville has not
yet had a mine which lived at depth.
* * * *
Chapman’s Gold has gone to Wilson’s
Patch (W.A.). Years ago a show was
worked off and on in this locality, and
then abandoned. It is this property that
Chapman’s has agreed to purchase for
£5OOO plus a 10 p.c. share interest, if de-
velopments. are satisfactory. There is
talk of the show yielding 20 p.c. p.a.,
but nothing has yet been disclosed to
warrant the belief.

Following cheery reports, official and
otherwise, Australia has increased its
holding in Paringas (W.A.) from 17,000
to 400,000 shares over the last two years.
At Kalgoorlie, where the co. is operating,
opinions differ as to whether shareholders
are likely to get much of a reward.

For the year ended June 30 last Rop-
pibon Tin, a Melbourne co. operating in
Siam, whose dredge capsized in April
and has not worked since, netted £20,131
as against £17,511 for the previous term.
The prefs. were handed 4s. per share
(= £10,000), but the ords., who got 2s.
per share in 1932, were passed by. The
co. treated 652,000 c.y. of 1.021 b. ground
for 296 tons of t. 0., which averaged £172
sterling, or £45 10s. more than the pre-
vious year’s figure. The dredge, to which
improvements have been made, should
begin work again about the end of next
month. The mishap cost the co. £3OOO.
When the books closed it had £18,702
in the bank. Under existing condi-
tions, there is about five and a half
years’ work ahead in virgin ground, and
retreatment of worked ground would take
another three and a half years. Without
any restrictions the estimated life of the
show is seven and a half years ; but the
board has its eye on new properties.
* * * *
Peninsular Tin, which thus far has
been a disappointment to its shareholders,
has bought the adjoining Nai Hoot pro-
perty, Siam, together with some plant
and quota rights, for £99,694 in fully-
paids. The new area comprises 849
acres, estimated to contain 32,000,000
c.y. of .751 b. ground. Also, the 150,000
shares of 30s. each, of which 132,925 are
issued, are to be divided into 300,000
shares of 15s. each. Shareholders will
receive 132,925 of the new shares fully
paid, another 132,925 paids go to the
vendor, and the remaining 34,150 are in
pickle.

SHADOW SHOWS.
According to a Hollywood storv, when
Lubitsch and Hecht had done with Noel
Coward’s “Design for Living” there was
only one line left. They tossed to see if
it should stay in or come out, and
Coward lost. The film, which arrived at
the Prince Edward last week, reveals that
they also revolutionised the characterisa-
tion.
In the play Leo, Otto and Gilda are
asexual; just three merry, prattling girls—
“all of a piece,” as Gilda says. When
Ernest calls Otto cries “How very sweet
to see you! ” and kisses him. When Leo
returns to the flat unexpectedly and finds
that Otto has spent the night there, the
furthest he goes in the way of protest
is to say “How vile of you!” and turn
sulkily away. He doesn’t even give Otto
a good push. They are soon friends again,
Frank Leighton, in “Two Minutes’
Silence,” lately at Sydney Civic and now
going the rounds.
and the drunk scene after the discovery
that Gilda has left them ends:
Leo: “We’ll get along somehow [his voice
breaks ] together”
Otto (struggling with his tears): “To-
gether”—
Leo ( giving way to his and breaking down
completely): “But we’re going to be awfully
—awfully—lonely”
They both sob hopelessly on each other’s
shoulders as the curtain slowly falls.
The Coward quip is essentially
regional. When a character who has been
asked if he would like a drink replies
“Passionately,” when he is offered cold
rice pudding and says “How glorious!”
there is laughter in the luxury quarters of
London and New York. The same with
the “Oh, my God!” joke which peppers
the stage version of “Design for Living.”
The argot of arty young Londoners
doesn’t appeal to most movie audiences,
so nearly all Coward’s dialogue had to
go. The play is credible as a genre pic-
ture of an unpleasant kind —so un-
pleasant that, though the dialogue is
harmless, no London producer has had
the nerve to stage it so far.
But in turning Leo and Otto into Tom
and George, and giving the parts to
such virile customers as Frederic March
and Gary Cooper respectively, Lubitsch
and Hecht have made the whole thing
meaningless as an interpretation of life.
When George returns to find Tom in the
flat he smashes him on the jaw. That
these hefty males should sob on each
other’s shoulders is unthinkable. And
Miriam Hopkins plays Gilda as a highly-
sexed girl. Leo, Otto and Gilda could
live together indefinitely with nothing
worse than an occasional slapping match
or fit of hysterics on the part of the lads.
If Tom, George and Gilda tried it for a
week there would be murder.
On the technical side the production is
masterly—the French sets are astonish-
ingly realistic —and E. Everett Horton is
great as the ill-used husband.
“Tilly and Gus” is an uproarious farce
featuring W. C. Fields (an imperturbable
old blackguard with top-hat, walking-
stick and cigar, as usual) and Alison
Skipworth. Most of their adventures take
place on a crazy river steamboat.
* * *
During the screening of “Meet My
Sister,” at Sydney Civic, which was
attended by this critic, part of “Waltz-
ing Matilda” was interpolated, the reels
having got mixed. It didn’t signify, and
similarly it wouldn’t have mattered if a
slab of the English comedy had been in-
serted into “Waltzing Matilda.”
The Australian farce tells how Norman
French and Pat Hanna sling Matilda
over their shoulders and take to the road
to dodge arrest for assaulting a con-
stable. French is individually pursued
by a private detective and a station-
keeper’s daughter. Both catch him, but
the detective only wants to give him good
news and the daughter (played by
Dorothy Parnham on lines reminiscent of
Elissa Landi) only wants to give him her
heart. Not that any of them matters
much. The film is chiefly designed to
provide Pat Hanna with situations in
which to clown funnily or drearily
according to the taste of the observer.
If all the bedrooms in English comedy
were put in line they would stretch twice,
or more, round the earth. “Meet My
Sister” is another of them. A hard-up
peer is going to marry an American
heiress. While he is trying to dump a
former love he finds in his luxurious bed
a female bill-collector whose storm-
soaked clothes are drying. What more
natural than that he should pass her off
on his prospective bride and father-in-
law as his sister?
Clifford Mollison is the idiot peer and
Constance Shotter is the girl-in-the-bed.
She mouths her words even more
markedly than most girls who play this
part in Elstree comedies.
* * *
There is some of the most brilliant
photography that has been seen in Aus-
tralia for a long while in “Female,” at the
Ethel Gabriel, in "Two Minutes’ Silence.”
Regent. A mint of money has been spent
on the settings, and one or two of the
interiors are beautiful enough to convert
Mr. J. S. McDonald himself to modern-
ism. Ruth Chatterton pervades the scene
as the owner of a motor-works. The
photographer has sub-edited her defects,
and surrounded her with the misty
glamor of a fine summer morning it\
England, so that she looks bewitching.
Ruth is the feminine equivalent of the
male boss who chases office typists. She
asks a succession of lads to her house.
When the library bell goes there are
ribald jokes in the servants’ hall, and
Leo Franklyn, in “Two Minutes’ Silence.”
Bob Grieg, her mammoth butler, pro-
ceeds to the scene of action with the
vodka, according to plan. The favored
ones are invariably turned down cold
next morning. Comes an evening when
she decides to go outside the business for
her fun. She accosts George Brent at
a shooting gallery, unknowing that he is
an engineer engaged by the firm on his
reputation. Brent treats her rough, and
domesticity soon looms. A somewhat
sordid romance, and there are indica-
tions that our censors have dealt hardly
with it. The happy ending isn’t satisfac-
tory either. Mr. Brent is obviously going
to have a thin time between his marriage
and the divorce a few months later. But
it is exceptionally easy to look at all
through, and the acting is admirable.
Ferdinand Gottschalk is almost painfully
realistic as an effeminate Pandarus.
“One Man’s Journey” is Lionel Barry-
more all the way. Eli Watt, M.D., is
good, brave, kind, whimsical, understand-
ing, modest and efficient; he also knows
how to use his eyes, eyebrows, hands
and voice. In short, he is what “The
Doctor Who Tells” might be with a good
stage education. After doing heroic
work in an epidemic, in addition to his
social activities, he gets his reward in
the acclamation of the profession and
the hand of faithful May Robson. Joel
McCrea, Dorothy Jordan and Frances
Dee are in the big cast.
Sundry Shows
When present critic first made the ac-
quaintance of “The Girl Friend,” he
wouldn’t have cared if he never saw the
lady again. However, she turned up at
Melb. King’s on Saturday night so re-
juvenated that it is suspected she has
been paying a visit to Voronoff. All the
old familiar machinery is evident, down
to the hotel day clerk who says to the
guest who complains that two rats are
fighting in her bedroom, “What do you
expect for two dollars—a bullfight?”
There are also the usual complication of
husbands and wives getting into the
wrong bedrooms and the customary
eruptions of chorus girl in situations of
traditional improbability. However, “The
Girl Friend” is in the custody of Gus
Bluett, Leo Franklyn, the local Isobel
Mahon and Agnes Doyle, and about
their work there was no hint of the Gov-
ernment stroke on Saturday night. Bluett
and Franklyn have never been funnier,
and Agnes Doyle has a queer contorted
art that is all her own. Miss Mahon
touched the great heart of the public by
drifting through the whirl of farce with
the sweetly innocent air of a Good Girl
accidentally found in bad company. She
has a teeny-weeny voice, but it is enough
for the simple requirements of Con
Conrad, Gus Kahn, Richard Rodgers
and Lorenz Hart, four confectors of
Yankee noises. Madge Aubrey, Frank
Leighton and Billy Milton have mainly
watching briefs.

In 1933 the Independent Theatre con-
ducted a one-act play competition, and
last week the four best entries were
placed on the boards at Sydney Savoy.
They were a disappointing bunch. J.
Hansby Read’s “Hoboes All” and “The
Fatal Year” and A. H. Moroney’s “Miss-
ing Jewels” showed promise ; each had
the germ of a good plot, but the dia-
logue was stilted and unreal. Dora Wil-
cox did better in “The Four Poster,”
though it hardly comes under the head-
ing of a one-act play, being a pure fan-
tasy. The players in all four pieces
showed little enthusiasm for their parts.
Sandwiched in between the plays were
impersonations—of Maurice Chevalier by
Jean Elwing, and of Greta Garbo by John
Wyndham. Harry Tighe was the pro-
ducer.

Long before the first number of Irene
Vera Young’s dance recital was presented
at the Sydney Savoy last week the “House
Full” sign was up. Over a dozen dances
were performed. Miss Young herself
dances with charm, but her “motion
choir” is as yet a little raw. The more
abstract dances, “Design,” “Diagram”
and “Round Rhythm,” performed by
Miss Young with either Jessie Hughes or
Barbara Young, while not possessing the
appeal of the narrative numbers, were
well received. An impression in move-
ment of Vachell Lindsay’s poem “Congo”
brought the house down.

Captain Adkins and his band con-
tinued to give a grand show at Melb.
Town- Hall all last week. As a cracker
of musical jokes the captain is without
a peer. One night he succeeded in mak-
ing his merry men paint a realistic pic-

ney,” at Sydney Regent.
ture of the perils of the wilds. Lions
roared and antelopes leapt and the audi-
torium was filled with the sound of rush-
ing waters. Like Percy Grainger, the
A.B.C. director has introduced a new
technique of conducting. Abandoning
the austere aloofness of the rostrum, he
moves amongst his band, stirring instan-
taneous response from the drums and
trombones. It is an effective device that
ought not to be lost on local orchestral
conductors.

The Famous Ardath Blend


ABORIGINALITIES
“Long-Long”: This happened in New
Guinea. The boss’s wife wanted milk for
a pudding and inquired if the houseboy
knew how to milk a cow. He said he
did; he explained that the mysteries of
extraction of “su-su” from the bullama-
cow were so familiar to him that they
rather bored him. So houseboy departed
with a bucket and instructions to hurry
up. Thirty-five minutes elapsed, and I
was sent to find out what was detaining
him. I found he had the cow nicely
bailed up and the bucket in the approved
position. But he was standing at the
animal’s head and yelling hopefully
though resultlessly: “Give ’im ; give ’im.”
♦ * * *
“O. W. Waireki”: Moko and Manu
came into our Hawke’s Bay township to
be married. At the appointed hour,
Manu and the minister were at the
church, but there was no sign of Moko.
As time passed the clergyman became
anxious, but Manu seemed not at all per-
turbed. Two hours later, the padre, now
“Why didn’t you pull the new hand out of the dam when you saw him trying to
drown himself?”
“This pfeller was learning him not to do it again, boss.”
very concerned, asked the lady if she did
not think something serious might have
happened to her absent lover. With a
placid smile she shook her head. “He
orrite,” she said. “He must pe up town
seeing his friends. He pe here to-
morrow.”
* * * *
“Moseilikatse”: Let me hop into that
controversy about “natives” possessing a
“sense or power that has been lost to
the white man,” the said power being sup-
posed to give them knowledge of far-
away happenings long before the white
man. The “power” mostly exists in the
imagination of the white yarn-spinner.
For instance, a paragraphist (B. 7/2/’34)
asks how one can explain the death of
Armit 400 miles from Samarai being
known six hours after it happened. The
answer is that it wasn’t. I was filling
Armit’s place only a short time after his
passing at Tamata. The first news re-
ceived in Samarai of the happening was
nearer six weeks than six days after the
occurrence. In mountainous Papua the
natives send messages tremendous dis-
tances from one mountain side to another
with long, chanting calls, just as the
South African tribes do. The same story
is told of these people, and “Kaffir tele-
graph” is a byword in the Union. The
classic instance is the massacre of the
94th Regiment at Bronkers Spruit in the
Transvaal in 1880. The legend runs that
the news was known in Pietermaritzburg
in Natal, 300 miles away, the same day,
there being then no rail or telegraph
communication. Writer has asked many
an old-timer in Natal, and especially in
’Maritzburg, if he had first-hand know-
ledge of the truth of the story. None of
them ever got further than saying he
had heard it from someone else.
* * * *
“Oudtshoorn”: No wonder the ostrich
industry in South Africa has gone to the
devil if all the farmers are like “L.E.8.”
and use cock birds for driving in trotting
races (B. 7/2/’34). A good cock ostrich
in full feather was worth anything up to
£2OO a few years ago, and the average
farmer would have as soon thought of
driving the wife and kids in a “carriage”
as of using such a valuable bird as a
hack.
* * * *
“Raskelf”: Calfskin waistcoats (B.
7/2/’34) are no monopoly of Australian
bushmen. When writer was a lad in the
North of England, they were generally
worn in the country by all classes, being
particularly affected by the horse-breed-
ing farmers of the North Riding of York-
shire. Since then they have occasionally
bloomed in St. James-street, and I have
recollections of a fleeting fashion in them
among Australian exquisites, or those
who liked to be regarded' in that light.
For the rest they were often “handsome
without being gaudy,” provided a well-
marked skin was incorporated in the
garment, and they were as warm and
comfortable a winter garment as any the
writer has known.
“Fataka”: In these days when cur-
rency questions are being argued all
over the world, Sydney enthusiasts visit-
ing the exhibition of Native Arts and
Crafts can see one ancient medium of
exchange which will shortly vanish from
the earth. This is vauvau, the feather
money of the Santa Cruz islands, which,
among its other advantages, is much
more attractive to the hand and eye
than the mangy paper stuff most civil-
ised peoples use to-day. The tiny
feathers are bright-red, and are taken
from the breast of a rare honey-eater
which sports only a few of them. They
are woven into a fibrous cloth made
from the inner bark of the hibiscus, and
this again is backed by a strip of paper
bark. As it is made, the strip is rolled
up, being added to bit by bit as oppor-
tunity serves. Similarly, lengths are cut
off as purchases are made. The making
of the feather coinage, like that of the
“When you’re dead, y’ faggot, I’ll jump on y’r grave.”
“That’ll do the. I’m gointer be buried at sea.”
feather cloaks of Hawaii, was the jeal-
ously guarded privilege of a few people.
In Hawaii, not only have the makers of
the cloaks vanished for ever, but also
the two varieties of bird which' supplied
the feathers, while only two of the cloaks
are known to be in existence to-day. Of
the Santa Crux money-makers, only one
is alive. When he goes his mystery will
die with him.

“X.S.”: Recently Melbourne suburban
trains were held up on three days in suc-
cession. On the first day a kite tail
shorted the overheads, and on the second
a steam-roller stalled at a level crossing.
The third stoppage was a quaint anti-
thesis to the second —a mouse got into an
electric feed-box.
* * * *
“Spare Vidocq”: Tradition used to
have it that the French police were the
finest sleuths in the
world. For me it has
been shattered by the
news that they have
been conducting labori-
ous experiments to find
out whether dogs follow
a trail by scent alone or
by sight. They tied a
lot of new boots to a
bicycle wheel and
trundled the contrap-
tion along a road.
Though the bootprints
were deep in the mud
the dogs took no inter-
est in them. When an
aged and overripe
boot was attached to
the wheel, the tykes,
with noses to the
ground, followed the
scent avidly. Thus the
Paris rozzers went to
great pains to find out
what humanity has
recognised from its be-
ginnings—that scent is
the all-important factor
in the life of a dog,
even if he be of those
one or two specialised
breeds like the grey-
hound and deerhound which are chiefly
used to run down their quarry by sight.
* * * *
“Tumoulin”: Rod Quinn’s story “The
Crook” (B. 13/12/’33) may be very good
fiction, but every bushman who has ex-
perience of dry stages will snort at the
local color. Two men undertake a tramp
of about 100 miles into the west through
a waterless country, whose chief features
were sun, sand and spinifex, with one bag
of water each. They did half the jour-
ney the first day (though the trail had dis-
appeared), travelling in the heat of the
day and resting in the cool of the night,
which seems imprudent, especially on the
part of such magnificent walkers. They
endured agonies of thirst that first night,
though they had consumed half their
water. Though one can place a canvas
bag of water directly on the edge of a
razor blade or on the point of a needle
without piercing the canvas, these walk-
ing-record experts popped their water-bag
on a splinter of weather-worn rock and
managed to puncture it. They had
thrown the other bag away! But though
they were such stupid fellows, one of
them, after the other had been left be-
hind, managed, guided only by the sun,
in a tramp of a further 40 miles, to get
within 10 miles of his destination, a
mining camp—a marvellous piece of
land navigation in a trackless waste!
Finally, although the rescued chap was
down with delirium for three weeks, the
other just lay down in the hot sand under
the blistering sun and quietly gave up
the ghost. Nay, nay, Rod! If you ever
tackled a dry stage you must have for-
gotten all you learned about it.
* * * *
“X-X”: “When I use a word,” Humpty
Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone,
“it means what I choose it to mean,
neither more nor less.” According to the
Potato Diseases Act, 1930, of Tasmania,
Sec. 2 of the Potato Diseases Act, 1909, is
amended by expunging the definition of
“Potato” and substituting “ ‘Potato’ in-
cludes tomato, carrot, parsnip and turnip
and the plant of the potato, tomato,
carrot, parsnip and turnip.” If ever Igo
to Van Diemen’s Land, and sit down to
the ordinary at one of the taverns of
Hobart Town, I shall be interested to
see what they bring me if I order spuds.
* * * *
“Herpeton”: It gave me quite a thrill
to read (B. 7/2/’34) of my old friend
the cow who went mysteriously dry and
the wicked snake who was subsequently
found to have stolen her milk. Milk
is only obtained from the cow by suc-
tion. This may take the form of milk-
ing machines, human fingers and the
calf’s mouth plus tongue. The snake,
as is well known, has no fingers, and it is
doubtful if he is supplied with a milking
machine, as a rule. His tongue, a mere
filament which he uses as an organ of
touch, is as incapable of suction as his
mouth and throat. Further, leaving out
the big pythons and boas, the average
snake has a total internal capacity of
a couple of pints. It is a poor cow nowa-
days that is not equal to giving a couple
of gallons daily. Yet “A.J.L.” asks us to
believe that a two-pint snake can hold
all the product of a two-gallon cow!
Marry, come up!
* * * *
“Jack’s Track”: Sheep must be more
particular about what they drink than
other animals. There is a spring at
Crowie, in the Cassilis district (N.S.W.),
which gushes out in a continuous stream
sufficient to water 10,000 sheep. I have
drunk the water and detected nothing
wrong, also used it for boiling the quart-
pot ; but sheep won’t drink it. A grazier
in Merriwa district during a drought
tried to force a mob of sheep on to this
country with disastrous results. Some
perished from thirst, and otners, when
released and taken to the Goulburn River,
ran amok into it and were drowned.
THE VANISHED NAVVIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that no railway bill is ever passed,
And harbor works and all that sort of thing
Are little more than memories of the past
Since grim Depression got us on a string,
And the capricious bird of oof took wing,
And Governments no more for loans could spar,
I often find myself conjecturing
Where in the world the old-time navvies are.
Where did they turn and whither were they cast,
Who jarrah sleepers erst were wont to sling
Around and lay them straight and firm and fast
For iron rails, from mom to evening;
Who made the dogspikes bite, the fishplates
cling,
The chaps who bridged grey plains and deserts
far,
And when their graft was done would have
their fling?
1 wonder where the old-time navvies are.
When will our brooding solitudes and vast
Echo again to words that scorch and sting,
The ganger’s sanguinary damn-and-blast,
The fusillade like shrapnel scattering?
When will lone pubs to hum and bustle spring
Anew, as Samsons pack six-deep the bar
For perk unanimously clamoring?
I wonder where the old-time navvies are.
Prince! When again the picks and banjos swing
The patient earth to score and seam and scar,
I’ll bet you’ll hear contractors muttering
“We dunno where the old-time navvies are.”

“Vil N.”: Little suburban Angy, loose
on a dairy farm for the first time, burst
into great-uncle George’s kitchen. “Pansy
has a little calf,” she shrilled ; “and it’s
that new it’s still wrapped in cellophane! ”
* * * *
“C.Q.”: Gippsland’s latest “terror of
the countryside” is now safe under lock
and key at Melb. Zoo, and its footprints
are being sought by Mr. Wilkie for
identification. The monster, however, is
so lethargic that it hasn’t yet made one.
Its size has diminished considerably in
captivity, but it is still a weighty beast,
being three feet long, of a fawn color,
with a large head blessed with a perfectly
stupid expression, feet like a policeman’s
and a voice with the pathetic note of
self-pity of a politician explaining why
he failed to top the poll at a by-election.
In short, it is a wombat. After having
been reported variously as a tiger, a pan-
ther, a wolf and an entirely new species
of man-eating mammal, it was laid by
the heels by Constable Figgins, of the
wireless patrol.

“Simon”: Next month, if all goes well
with a three-masted schooner now beat-
ing its way down the eastern Pacific, a
little band of scientists will land on
Chatham Island in the Galapagos Group
to erect a monument to Charles Darwin.
It is a century since Darwin, in the
Beagle, roamed those seas. He was a
shaggy-browed, intensely sensitive young
“What are you sniggering at?”
“I’ve just introduced that new beach inspector from Australia to Lady Godiva.”
man who had studied medicine and
found he had no love for it; who had
qualified for holy orders and found he
had no vocation in that direction. He
loved rocks and beetles, and when he
had a chance to join the Beagle as
“naturalist” he accepted with enthusiasm.
He wasn’t prima facie the. best man for
the job, but he was willing to give five
years of his life for it. In the first two
years of the cruise he learned more
about botany, zoology and anthropology
than a dozen universities could have
taught him. He started as a half-pie
naturalist, but wound up with the equip-
ment to launch one of the most en-
lightening generalisations that had elec-
trified science since the world began. It
is almost certain that the germ of his
evolutionary theory had its birth aboard
the Beagle, but he spent 24 years collect-
ting corroborative evidence before he
published the “Origin of Species.” The
theory stands. The scientific shot and
shell of three-quarters of a century have
made only a few dints in it, and if the
expedition to the Galapagos islet has in
mind the erection of a monument ade-
quate to Darwin’s memory it is in for a
very long job.
* * * *
“Navigators”: One of those Austra-
lian journals which fill their pages with
syndicated drawings from America and
Britain perpetrated a shocking bloomer
by proxy the other day. It features the
work of a Yankee draughtsman who por-
trays items which he considers doubtful
of belief. One of his recent efforts shows
a face with heavy incised markings, and
the explanation is that this painful tattoo-
ing process is peculiar to the Samoans, a
people which, in the writer’s recollection,
does not tattoo at all. The face is, of
course, that of a Maori, a people unique
in the use of this very painful process of
face ornamentation, though the Austra-
lian blacks did and do mark their bodies
in designs by processes as agonising.
* * * *
“Ghilzai”: Concerning the camel
that was inflated to make a buyer think
he was fat (B. 7/2/’34), it can only be
said that the injection of large quanti-
ties of air under the skin as described in
the paragraph would have killed the brute
in short order, since the inflation would
have lifted the connecting tissues between
hide and flesh all over the body. Years
ago writer knew a kangaroo-shooter who
used a bike pump pointed with a
butcher’s brine-injection needle to pump
air under the skin of kangaroos he shot.
He worked alone and claimed that this
saved him much valuable time, the skin
pulling off like a glove as soon as the
necessary knife cuts had been made.
There is only one way to give a thin
camel a matronly figure in a hurry. Salt
the brute’s feed heavily for a couple of
days and then let him have all the water
he wants.
“Spinifex”: Doubt whether camels can
be fattened by inflation, but on the Mount
Oxide-road, in Queensland’s north-west,
I have seen the ’Ghans repairing camels’
humps which have been chafed or worn
down through carrying heavy loads of
copper ore. Amadullah hooshtahs the
camel into the usual kneeling posture,
pours fat out of a bucket over the hump,
then briskly rubs it in with a hot shovel
whilst the beast roars its complaints to
the world. The hump absorbs the fat
and, after several applications over the
course of a few days, regains its normal
size. Amadullah can then load the camel
again with 6cwt. to Bcwt. of copper ore.
* * * *
“Barangkali”: In our telegraph mess
on an Asian station members of the staff
might please themselves what they wore
at tiffin, but for dinner long white
trousers and short-sleeved shirts were in-
sisted on. A new mess president altered
the rule; we were required to wear white
coats. On the first night the other 16
men had taken their places at the table
before the m.p. arrived, all looking un-
comfortable in their newly-starched
white coats. Despite the heat, dinner
was a hilarious affair. The 16 rose before
the m.p. had finished. As we filed out a
look of amazement and horror gradually
“That’s what causes revolutions. There’s thousands of us would be only too glad
to get what they’re going to burn.’
spread over his face. Everyone was
dressed in the white coat, but not one
man was wearing anything below the
waist. Next day we switched back to
the old rule.
* * * *
“Rector”: A rambling garden at a
homestead on a farm near Dubbo pos-
sesses a Banksia-rose bush planted as
a cutting 50 years ago last August. Its
trunk has a girth of 39in., which Dubbo
reckons must be a world’s record for a
rose-tree.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: Holidaying in the sou’-
west corner of Vic., where I spent part of
my boyhood, I sought out some of the
old spots on the creek
at dusk, but fished in
vain. An old chap
in response to my
question said, “Black-
fish? Haven’t seen
one for years. The
trout cleaned the
blackfish up years
ago. Toopoh g s?
They’re nearly all
gone, too.” I fished
most of next day and
landed three toopongs
and six dozen English
perch. Perch make a
passable feed, but I
doubt if anywhere in
the world there are
two more tasty fresh-
water fish than the
toopong and the
blackfish. Neither
attains to a greater
weight than a pound,
but they are delicious.
What good trout are
to anyone beats me.
I’m sure very few
are eaten —and then
only by people who
have heard so much of trout that they
imagine they must be good. It is a crime
to put inedible, greedy-feeding brutes
like trout into creeks to exterminate
unique and delicate native fish.
* * * *
“Mako”: The story of Larry (B.
10/1/’34) who grabbed his amputated
finger and put it on again wrong way
round had a parallel in my own experi-
ence. When my brother was two years
old he placed his hand under a door,
which, on being suddenly opened, stripped
flesh and nail from the top of his little
finger. A resourceful visitor took the
flesh, hanging by a thread of skin, re-
placed it, and bound up the hand. There
was no doctor within miles, and it was
deemed best not to touch the hand for a
day or so. Then it was found the finger
was already well healed, but the nail was
skewed round to one side. The victim
had his trouble over that crooked finger
when he went up for examination in
war-time.
* * * *
“Ornis”: I am gratified to hear that
our old friend the hen is to play a nobler
part in the scheme of things than hitherto.
Scientists busy isolating the virus of in-
fluenza have discovered that an
egg is the most bacteria-free of
all living tissue in which to de-
velop the virus. This is injected
through the shell, which is sealed
and incubated. It is announced
that the egg may soon replace
the calf and the horse for the
production of vaccines, since it
is far more immune from out-
ward infection than any other
agent of the sort. It may well
be so. But occasionally one opens a
grocer’s egg which seems to have been
inoculated with all the seven deadly sins,
with the odors of Tophet thrown in to
make good measure.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Last year the Moresby
was put into commission again for sur-
vey work, and her discovery of a new
reef (named Wilson, after Queensland’s
Governor) about 23 miles n.-n.-w. of
Cape Upstart, at the southern entrance
to Flinders Passage, is testimony to the
need for continuing the survey. The
newly-charted reef is right in the track
of all steamers operating on the Queens-
land coast, and is thought to be identical
with one which was picked up by a
Japanese lugger operating from Thursday
Island in 1932. The Jap skipper at first
thought he had located a wreck, as the
chart showed 19 fathoms ; but soundings
revealed a shoal 18ft. under the surface,
just high enough to tear the bottom out
of a ship going at full speed. The finding
of the reef provides a possible solution
of the Yongala mystery.
* * * *
“Westgate”: Sydney’s Mosman started
out as Mossman. In the N.S.W. “Gazet-
teer,” published 1866, the following
appears: “Mossman’s Bay (or Great
Sirius Cove), native name Goram-Bulla-
gong, is a long, narrow indentation into
the north shore of Port Jackson, run-
ning up to a fine sandy beach.... The
Messrs. Mossman formerly had a whaling
establishment in this cove.”
* * * *
“C.P.C.”: The marsupial mole (Noto-
ryctes typhlops) of Centralia is a queer
little animal discovered in 1888 by Dr.
E. C. Stirling, who was boss of Adel-
aide Museum for years. The mole
caused a bit of a stir, as it was a zoo-
logical novelty. The silky-haired bur-
rower, six inches over all from stem to
stern, is completely blind, though it has
rudimentary eyes. It has no external ear,
and a tiny pouch opens backwards. A
horny shield tops the snout, and the
claws on the forelegs are enormously
developed in comparison with the size of
the beast. They account for the little
chap’s speed when burrowing in the sand
beneath the surface when on the hunt
for insects and ants. But it can’t stay
below indefinitely, and now and again
has to come up for air, which is the only
time it is likely to be seen. The moles
found outside the desert areas of S. Aus.
fell to surveyor A. W. Canning on his
stock-route expedition from Wiluna to
Hall’s Creek (W.A.) in 1908. He got two
specimens in spinifex country. Another
species, N. caurinus, has since been found
at Wollal on the Ninety Mile Beach up
Broome way.
BY WAY OF EXPLANATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You “don’t know why” I “stick to him,” you’ve
often told me plain,
And I suppose you’ll tell it me a score of
times again.
You “can’t think what” I “see in him.” Well,
that of course may be,
But p’r’aps it’s hard to fathom, too, what he
can see in me.
You “wonder what” I “see in him”? Then
keep on wondering.
It has me thinking too sometimes, the same
perplexing thing.
But why pursue that train of thought through
all its ins and outs,
When I suspect he’s often jarred by very
sim’lar doubts?
So you must take things as they come, and let
the rest go by.
In everything and everywhere, there’s more than
meets the eye.
And life would be an empty thing did we not
try to see
The kind of man I think he is and he imagines
me.
You “don’t know why” I “stick to him”? Per-
haps it’s curious, too;
But then, you see, it all depends upon the
point of view.
And why should anyone protest when someone
claims that he
Can see in me the kind of man that I pretend
to be?
You “wonder what” I “see in him”? Again I
hear your voice.
But then, when all is said and done, I’ve very
little choice.
For vanity demands we hold, by every known
device,
To those who try to take us at our own —not
others’—price.

SPRING AND
SUMMER
SYDNEY HAS AN
IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO
HOLIDAY MAKERS.
Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harbor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical
and picture and other pleasure resorts. Sydney’s shops
with their displays are reached by tram. Winter Garden
with Orchestra. Terms from 6/6 per night (room only)
you will combine with economy the greatest comfort. Service is
not the slogan—it is the practice.

“Few luxury shops are without broken win-
dows from the Opera to the Madeleine. Every-

This forenoon calf would, of course, be

STOP PRESS!
“When a family moved from Bondi Beach
to Chatswood on January 29, the household
cat could not be found, and it was left behind.
Thirteen days later it wandered into the Chats-
wood home. The only explanation is that it
travelled the journey by road.”
—“S. M. Herald.”
Later. —The “Herald’s” special corres-
pondent at Chatswood learns that the
local police have taken up the case. The
C.I.D. believe that the cat “scaled” its
way to Chatswood on trams.
Later. —A new line of investigation is
being followed in connection with the
Chatswood cat mystery. Mr. Mackay is
investigating a theory that the cat swam
from Bondi, via the Heads, reached the
Harbor Bridge, by way of Milson’s Point,
and proceeded thence to Chatswood.
Monday. —A deputation urged the Pre-
mier this morning to have a cat-proof
fence erected underneath the bridge. It
was pointed out that dogs walking across
the bridge might be shocked by the
sudden appearance of drenched cats
arriving from the harbor.
Tuesday. —A “milk-o” fund has been
started by the “Sun” on behalf of the
cat. The sum already in hand is suffi-
cient to guarantee a daily supply of best
milk for the nation’s heroine for 27 !
years at the rate of one gallon per day.
Wednesday. —lnterviewed by the “Sun”
at. its new Chatswood home, the cat
said: “It is quite untrue to state that
“Where’s the artist ?”
“At the pub. He’s gotter go there every ’arf-hour ter see what ’is picture looks
like from a distance.”
I am going to live in Victoria. True I
have had offers to take up work there,
but I like Sydney too much. I love the
harbor, and milk. I think the police
wonderful. I think the ‘Sun’ wonder-
ful, too. Thfe report that I have been
offered a billet in the ‘Herald’ office is
quite untrue. I am remaining in Chats-
wood.”
The cat then posed for its photograpn
displaying a devastating “Sun” smile.
“It’s enough to make a cat laugh,” said
the dauntless hiker as the photographer
made his historic picture.

“FOR THE PRINCE’S BENEFIT.”
“The Sydney pageant will proceed to
the Showground, where tableaux representative
of Australian life will be staged for the Prince s
benefit!”
Tableau I. — Mr. Herb Slummick, Catch-
ing His Morning Train.
The Prince will here be given an in-
sight into the far-famed athleticism of
our race. Mr. S.’s train leaves at 8.12,
and, though a sufferer from arthritis and
corns, he rarely allows himself more than
four minutes to cover the half-mile to
the station.
Mr. Slummick wears to business a
“Fityu” imitation panama, “Eziepad”
bullock’s blood footwear and one of
the latest mauve shirts (with extra
collar) at 4s. lid. apiece, or three for 12s.
Classed in a recent “Sun” symposium as
one of Sydney’s six best-dressed men,
Mr. S. should give our royal visitor one
or two ideas which may find expression
later in Savile Row and the Burlington
Arcade.
Tableau II. — Mrs. Slummick Getting the
Kids Off to School.
This, besides presenting an affecting
picture of N. S. Wales domesticity, will
enable H.R.H. to judge between
“Teacher’s English” and our national
accent.
“Sy, Jower lyte ! " (“Say, Joe, you’re late!”)
“Dowbee sully!” (“Don’t be silly!”)
“Wot ile doer yew’s ashime, Jow.” (“What
I’ll do to you’s a shame, Joe.”)
Typical Younger Set badinage of the
sort should prepare our King-Emperor’s
youngest son for
Tableau 111. — Mr. Slummick Buying His
Weekly Lottery Ticket.
All is optimism in Madame Bella-
donna’s lottery studio. Smiling gaily Mr.
S. spars up as usual, hoping against hope
in true sporting Aussie fashion, though
he has spent close on £lOO since the lot-
tery started without winning a bob. Such
is the courage of the Empire breed.
Tableau IV. — Closing-time.
Round a glorious Grseco-Byzantine
bar, presided over by a number of lovely
girls, some hundreds of upstanding Aus-
sies are fighting like mad to be served.
Mr. Slummick enters hurriedly. A
glance at the clock, which points to 5.55,
“Here comes the bride-to-be. See if you can talk her into one of our new beds,
Mr. Bobble.”
and, heedless of arthritis, corns and all
else, he hurls himself at the milling
throng. “Time gents, please!”
Let our distinguished visitor keep a
steadfast eye on Mr. S., and gain a lesson
in dogged concentration which may be
of value to him in after life. Protests.
Howls. Curses. As the clock strikes,
Mr. S. is shot hatless from the crowd as
by a catapult. But he is wiping his
mouth. Aussie nerve and initiative have
scored again.
10-2-4.

NUMBERED OFF.
“ ‘Numerology’ is an exact science. It has
been proved, time and again, that numbers have
a bearing on human fate. Those who study the
rules carefully may avoid a great deal of
trouble.”— Sunday . “Sun.”
Correct; indisputably correct. Thus to
own one wife may be unlucky, but it is
the apotheosis of bad luck to acquire two.
Two mothers-imlaw are also disastrous.
Wise men avoid a lot of trouble by re-
membering these rules.
Many people consider it unlucky to
pay their tradesmen on the thirteenth (or
any other) day of the month. This is no
idle superstition, but a valuable profit-
maker if kept in mind. Particularly
useful on moving day.
Five aces, if your opponents at poker
get to know of it, are extremely unlucky.
The experienced numerologist will con-
trive to jettison at least one ace and
pick up another card before showing his
hand. Five aces almost invariably por-
tend violence.
Six months, twelve months and, still
more, three years are to be sedulously
avoided for as long as possible. The
fixation of the numerals here, of course,
is in the hands of another. No. 9 must
be avoided by soldiers on active service.
A numeral of varying value is 2. Take
“too much.” Many consider themselves
lucky if they can get it; others contend
that it is a contradiction in terms, and
non-existent. Teetotallers take an oppo-
site view, and contend that the conse-
quences are usually unlucky, leading to
the loss of £2 or/and the loser’s reputa-
tion and liberty.

“Women’s toes, except the great toe, are
disappearing.”—Dr. Norman Lake.
It looks as if their partners will be
left with nothing to dance on now.
Modern taxation is making a little

CHEATING DEATH.
“He left home in March and went to stay
at a boarding-house. He died in August.”
~“S. M. Herald ”
Death is not always inevitable. One
method of avoiding it is to bring your
own food. Alternatively, the death-
dodger may owe the boarding-house bill
and be thrown out. He will be able
thereafter to play for safety in a soup
kitchen.
Many pay their bills and feed out,
using the boarding-house for the purpose
of entertaining creditors. The official
receiver has been diddled out of his com-
mission on more than one insolvent estate
in this way. Dead creditors, as the saying
goes, issue no bankruptcy notices.
There are, of course, people of hardy
constitutions who can defy any boarding-
house diet in reason. They are usually
beer-drinkers who do a good deal of
counter-lunching during the day.
It is thus quite possible for a boarder
to escape the Grim Reaper. More would
do it but for the fact that most boarders
think they might as well be dead, any-
how. u

“I am a man who never takes advice
From anyone,” 1 said. “Alone, I play
The game of life without reflecting twice

And pants, like mine, displaying rent
and rip.
“Shake hands with me, my friend, for
I’m the goat
Who follows ev’rybody’s proffered
tip !”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Hall Mark has opened his autumn
career inauspiciously. C. B. Kellow’s
colt was vanquished by Gaine Carrington
on Feb. 7, and by Danilo in the
St. George Stakes at Caulfield. To go
down before Gaine Carrington was no
disgrace, but even with a 101 b. pull Danilo
did not seem qualified on form to make
a race of it with Hall Mark. At the
V.R.C. spring meeting Danilo squeezed
home in advance of six moderates in the
Carnival Handicap, but could not finish
nearer than third in the Batman Stakes.
In the C. F. Orr Stakes at Williamstown
on January 29 he was third to Gaine Car-
rington and Noel Soldat. That effort did
not cause the Chivalrous colt to be in
appreciable demand for the St. George
Stakes. McShortodds unavailingly strove
to lay 100 to 8.
Danilo is trained in the stable which
sheltered Artilleryman at the time of his
Melbourne Cup triumph. His dam,
Operetta, is by Devizes from the 1917
Oaks winner, Folly Queen, who, strangely
enough, was a sister to Artilleryman.
Going up the hill in the St. George
Stakes some of the outside horses
crowded in on Danilo, who was on the
rails. In such circumstances Dempsey
generally makes for the nearest safety
zone, and Danilo soon became conspicu-

ous near the tail of the field. Middle
Watch had suffered serious interference
shortly after the start, and both he and
Danilo appeared to be out of the race.
Yet Danilo—ridden to perfection by
Dempsey subsequent to the trouble—un-
wound a tremendous run in the straight
and vanquished Hall Mark by half a
neck. With a magnificently sustained
effort from the home turn, Middle Watch
secured third honors, three-quarters of a
length farther off.
Dempsey rode Hall Mark when the
colt lost to Gaine Carrington at Williams-
town a week before, Pike being on the
winner. The disablement of Gaine Car-
rington left Pike free to accept other
engagements, and Kellow snapped him
up for Hall Mark. It must have given
Dempsey a lot of satisfaction to over-
throw Kellow’s champion. In lightness
of touch on bridle-reins Frank is superior
to any contemporary, and this gift con-
tributed materially to the success of
Danilo. After the race Pike came in for
unfavorable criticism. The master horse-
man from Sydney rarely errs in judg-
ment, but results proved that he did
wrong in going after the leaders half a
mile from home and leading into the
straight on a colt not thoroughly strung
up. The nine furlongs was run in close
on record time for the course.
The Oakleigh Plate went to First
Money, an aged gelding of Maoriland
origin belonging to B. E. Martin, of Tas-
mania. He is trained by G. E. Simpson
of Flemington, who never previously
handled a horse of such good calibre.
First Money gave evidence of exceptional
sprinting ability by running La Seal a to
a head at Epsom on January 13, and La
Scala subsequently appropriated an Ascot
Five Hundred. He beat Oakland Belle
at Moonee Valley, but that mare turned
the tables on him at Williamstown. This
form, though creditable, did not make
First Money out to be an Oakleigh Plate
proposition, and odds of 15 to 1 could be
got. Sent from No. 1 berth to the ex-
treme outside fpr misbehavior, First
Money rose superior to this disadvantage.
He deposed Multudo from control
just after entering the straight, and,
gamely withstanding a challenge from the
favorite, Heros, won by a neck.
Had Heros found his legs a bit earlier
he must have won the Plate. The Holt
stable experienced bad luck with this
horse and with Hall Mark as well, but
Pike evened up matters to some extent
by landing the Salisbury Welter on
Gordon’s Leap, another son of Heroic,
who started at the nice price of 10 to 1.
Last-named race should have gone to
the favorite, Sly Look. Either Sly Look
could not go the early pace or Frank
Dempsey was afraid of being smothered
in the ruck. Sly Look was third-last six
furlongs from home, and thus did well to
run third.
......
Backed to 5 to 4 on for the first divi-
sion of the Federal Stakes, the Sydney
juvenile, Bombus, gave Darby Munro an
exasperating ride. He did not take hold
of the bit until two furlongs had been
traversed and then began to fly, but went
right off the course at the home turn.
Bailey Payten, the trainer of Bombus,
was compensated by the Bond Handicap
success of Mince Pie (7 to 1), who
reached the judge half a length in ad-
vance of the 2-to-l favorite, Heroic
Prince. Mince Pie is in the Australian
Cup with 7st. 91b., but may be rehandi-
capped.
Divisions of the Juvenile Handicap
were landed by Great Legend and Aztec
respectively. Aztec scored brilliantly,
under difficulties. He lost the Maribyr-
nong Plate to Pasha by half a neck in
the spring, but should turn the tables on
J. T. Jamieson’s colt in the Sires’ Pro-
duce Stakes. Pasha was not marketable
in the race won by Great Legend and
helped to whip-in the field.
* * * *
Sydney sportsman A. B. Abel has been
compensated for previous unlucky ven-
tures by the successes of The Marne,
who cost him 500 guineas as a yearling.
The Heroic colt, a fine chestnut, recently
won at Rosehill, and at Warwick Farm
on Saturday, starting at 7 to 4, he made
hacks of his opponents in the Ingleburn
Nursery. Jovial Son and Not So Bad
filled the places. The Breeders’ Plate
winner Fashion Star was backed, but was
not forward enough to trouble the place-
getters. The Marne is trained at Rand-
wick by William Kelso, who selected the
colt for Abel. He has all the brilliancy
of his sire, and his dam, Kalyanni, is
related to Holdfast.
Rosehill trainer William Booth fol-
lowed up his triumphs at Rosehill by
annexing the Flying Handicap with
Fleet (3 to 1). The Caravel filly put up
a meritorious performance, as 1 she was
badly placed at the turn, but young
Zensky wisely took her on the outside
at the Leger, and she literally flew to nar-
rowly beat the pacemaker, Charalf, with
Winasian a close third. Charalf hit the
front a shade too soon. Diamond de
Rouge, now trained by George Price, was
made favorite ; to the disgust of his
backers he finished last. Another failure
was Some Hero, brother to Hall Mark.
Le Legion, getting ready for the autumn
events, looked nice and bright.
T Htor-irri
It is seldom a good plan to discard
horses because they are beaten in track
trials Frescade (4 to 1) took the Farm
Novice in a manner that suggested that
she will be heard of in better company.
Frescade found Catalan too smart in
several trials, but, whereas the latter
failed, Frescade was always going like
a winner to score easily from Jap Silk
and Salted Almond. She is by David
from Coolstone, a combination ot
stamina and speed.
", '
Walter Brunton s little grey colt Rox-
burgh (7 to 4) did not give his opponents
much chance of beating him in the War-
wick Handicap. He was always well
placed, and, taking charge in the straight,
went on to score comfortably from Lav-
mgton, who could not handle the turns,
with Polette third. Pytheus and Akuna
disappointed ; the mare finished last.
Cherbourg was backed because he likes
the track, but he merely plodded all the
way to finish fourth.
Old Royal Tune was the popular fancy
for the Minto Handicap, but the solid
pace set by Prince Pombal was not to his
liking, and he never got into the picture,
Fame (11 to 2), a stable-mate of Omagh
and Sassanides, went after Prince Pom-
bal in the straight, and got there easily,
with Gravure in third position. Babili
let the Kelso stable down badly.
Made favorite for the first division of
the Maiden, Cid (3 to 1), a stable-mate
of Peter Pan, lost ground at the start,
but responded gamely when Darcy Webb
called on him for a final effort. He beat
the Newcastle-owned and -trained Ros-
mead nicely. He is owned by Mrs. S. R.
Coward, of Bathurst, and is by Blue
Flame from Smart Shoe, by Chipilly.
Backed from 20 to 1 to sevens, Russky
won the second division from Rogarma
and the 14.2 pony Sinuoma. Sun Brown
was favorite, but must have left his race
on the track, as he could not raise a
gallop.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
It is rare for a modern wrestler to
gain a fall in the first round, but Sam
Burmeister achieved the feat at Leich-
hardt on Saturday, at Bill Beth’s expense,
two minutes after the match Started. In
the fifth round, however, he was slung
over the ropes, and a collision with the
floor put him out of commission.
* * * *
Tom Lurich successfully defended his
mythical Australian heavyweight cham-
pionship against Joe Dawson at New-
town. The match was scheduled for
eight rounds, and Lurich did not get the
deciding fall until the last. Dawson is
a dinkum Aussie ; Lurich comes from
the Ukraine or some place like that.
Ins and Outs
Westralia did not repeat its good show-
ing against South Australia when meet-
ing Victoria in Melbourne last week.
Victoria ran up 438 for 7 wickets, All-
sopp, a N.S.W. inter-State player of
some years back, gathering 146. West-
ralia’s reply was 185 and 133, Plant and
Gregory bowling well in each innings.
* * * *
“St. Kilda”: Badcock (B. 14/2/’34)
seems to have a level head on him, for
he has announced that unless he gets a
watertight contract he is going back again
to the Apple Isle. Both Victoria and
South Australia seem to have made glow-
ing promises, but, to time of writing,
nothing better. Badcock is a Yorkshire
name, and its owner is, in effect, acting
up to the old Sheffield demand when
business is talked—“ Show ma.”
“Hotham”: A. E. Johns, dead in
Melbourne at 65, was one of the finest
wicketkeepers Australia has produced.
He was selected as first ’keeper for the
1896 Australian Xl.—not second, as even
the Melbourne obituaries state—but for
some reason or another did not find
favor with the coterie of practically pro-
fessional players who ran Australian
Elevens in those days. Jack Harry, of
Bendigo, a very good bat and bowler
and an inter-State ’keeper in addition,
was chosen as second string to Johns.
This did not suit the junta either, so
Harry was edged out after being chosen
and compensation had to be paid to him.
Jim Kelly, of N.S.W., filled Harry’s place
and was selected as first ’keeper in all
the important matches in England. The
excuse was that Johns’s hands couldn’t
stand the battering. It was to put
an end to jokes like this that the Board
of Control came into existence. Deceased
was for years a Melbourne C.C. com-
mitteeman and a trustee of the M.C.G.
{Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
The fifth and final tennis Test between
England and Australia at Perth saw the
visitors on top at last. Perry won all his
matches, beating Hopman and Quist in
the singles and winning both his doubles
with Wilde as partner. Hughes was also
successful, downing the colts Ewin and
Purcell, and taking one of the doubles
with Lee. On the other side, Purcell
overcame Wilde, and Moon beat Wilde
and Lee. Hopman and Quist won the first
doubles match from Hughes and Lee.
McGrath and Crawford did not play. On
performance on this tour Perry is the only
singles player to be reckoned with among
the visitors. He and Hughes are an
almost invincible doubles pair.
“Centre Court”: Though some of the
overseas critics seem confident that Aus-
tralia will win the right to challenge Eng-
land for the Davis Cup this year, the
reference to a stiff hurdle in Japan (B.
14/2/’34) is justified. Last year Japan
settled down to a three years’ plan to win
the cup, setting aside £6ooo—a very large
sum in Nippon—for the special purpose
of rooting out and coaching youngsters
of promise. Already three hitherto un-
knowns have been discovered, and two
of these have beaten Satoh and Nunoi,
up to then Japan’s best pair, on several
occasions. Nishimura won the last singles
championship, defeating Fujikura in the
final, and the pair now rank 1 and 2.
The third find, Yamagishi, got to the
semi-finals of the championships. He is
a fine doubles player with a devastating
volley. All three are in the early 20’s.
(Continued on next page.)
A huge crowd went to Sydney Show
Ground to see the N.S.W. John Hops,
aided by a sprinkling from* Victoria and
M.L., hold their annual gathering.
Fletcher, of Victoria, won the light heavy
wrestling in the police championships;
Power, also a Victorian, taking the middle
title on a forfeit from an injured oppo-
nent. The track and field events all went
to N.5.W.,, Masters winning the 100 in
after Golding had been passed
out for breaking. Golding won the 880
in 2min. 11 3-ssec. and a N.S.W. cham-
pionship 100 in 10 l-10sec. Plummer
(41ft. 3in.) won the 161 b. shot, and
Graham (121 ft. Bin.) the 161 b. hammer.
Spicer took the high-jump with sft. 10in.
* * * *
Noel Ryan topped off a record season
by winning the N.S.W. amateur mile
championship in 21min. 34 3-10 sec. This
beat his own record for an Australian,
made at the recent national champion-
ships, by 2 3-10 sec. The swimmers were
greatly incommoded by some motor-boat
racing pests who sent the wash from
their craft surging through the Manly
Baths during the race.

Ins and Outs
“Cash Amateur”: A deep gloom de-
scended on Sydney when it was announced
that Don Bradman was shifting to Adel-
aide, where he will in future play for
South Australia. He is joining a firm of
stock- and sharebrokers, being tired of
writing and talking about cricket, and so
that he may become, when his cricket
days are over, something more than a
professional gladiator living on his
laurels. It is a praiseworthy aspiration.
“Staffs”: In Sheffield cricket Brad-
man has made 2065 runs for an
average of 147.50 against Victoria. His
Queensland record shows 1299 runs,
averaging 144.33. Against the Wheat-
fielders Bradman has had 20 knocks, all
of ’em out, and has scored 1269 for an
average of 63.45. As a testimonial to
Grimmett’s bowling those figures speak
for themselves.
* * * *
India lost the third Test with Jardine’s
team by 203 runs, the Englishmen set-
ting the home side 451 to get on a worn
wicket in the fourth innings. Their limit
was 249, of which the Yuvaraj of Patiala
scored a plucky 60. Taken by and large
the tour has proved conclusively that
the Indians are as yet miles below Test-
match form.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: The English Eleven’s
tour of India ended on a rather unhappy
note when Jardine protested against
Frank Tarrant acting as umpire in the
final Test. The protest was based on
the number of l.b.w. decisions given by
Tarrant against the Englishmen in pre-
vious matches. It is unfortunate for
the English skipper that in the final Test
the umpire he approved of gave four
l.b.w. decisions against his side in the
first innings, which suggests that the Eng-
lish batsman’s tendency to get his leg in
front rather than the great Anglo-Aus-
tralian cricketer’s judgment was at fault.
When Jardine was in Australia his side
lost 13 wickets l.b.w. in the five Tests, an
unusually high percentage. If Jardine
protested, even the yelper press did not
report it.
* * * *
“Not Understood”: To a right-think-
ing Briton like the writer it is saddening to
read that that Scottish epitome of Eng-
lish sportsmanship D. R. Jardine has
had almost as bad a spin in the matter of
public esteem during his Indian tour as
he suffered at the mouths of the uncouth
Australians. I read in the cables that
after one of his fast bowlers had cut
down one of India’s best batsmen the
native spectators had the infernal temerity
to demand the bowler’s removal. Then,
when England was batting, certain bud-
mashi in the crowd produced looking-
glasses, which they flashed in the eyes of
the sahibs. The climax came when only
one member of the Indian Test team
attended a dinner given to both sides.
This was hardly due to caste prejudice,
for most of the Indian players are Mos-
lems. Even in the case of high-caste
Hindus it is permitted to attend such a
function, with reservations as to eating
and drinking. The Indians are evidently
like the Australians—squealers and lack-
ing in sportsmanship.

“Kennington”: The Australian Eleven
is to be closely watched on arriving in
England. On its landing on April 26, the
“News Chronicle” says it will be
“escorted to its hotel” —presumably by
an armed guard of the Grenadiers or
whichever regiment of the Household
Brigade is on duty at the Tower. The
following day it will practise at Lord’s,
and again next morning. In the after-
noon it will be condemned to watch the
final of the Association Cup at Wembley.
Few of the team will be able to under-
stand the game, but, as at least one
Lancashire club looks like being in the
final, they will get an idea of what North
Country barracking means. When they
have recovered next day they will lunch
at the Savoy and then go on to Wor-
cester, where their first match awaits
them.
* * * *
“Old Trafford”: Following on the
mess-up made of the proposed tour of
Maoriland by a team of Australian
cricketers, a business largely brought
about by the take-it-or-leave-it policy of
the Australian selectors and the Board of
Control, that fine Australian cricketer of
other days E. L. Waddy hopped in with
an offer to take a private team over to
the Shivery Isles at his own risk. Waddy
has had a lot of experience of tours of
this kind, and his personality would have
drawn a far better side than that which
our selectors thought fit to inflict on the
indignant All Blacks. His offer was, of
course, turned down at once by the Board
of Control. A pity Australian cricket
cannot get away from the regimentation
which is stifling it. In England the
pleasantest cricket is that played by tour-
ing teams, which, while owing allegiance
to the M.C.C., make their own fixture
lists up and down the country. Many of
these, including University sides like the
Harlequins and the Incogniti, number
county and international players in their
ranks, but their one-day matches and the
fun got in travelling between games are
half the charm of the system—if it can
be called a system.
* * * *
This year Australia is to hear a ball-
for-ball radio broadcast of the Test
matches in England by courtesy of
Vacuum Oil. On the opening night of
each match the broadcast will begin at
8 p.m. (eastern time) and on other nights
at 8.30, and will continue to 3.30 a.m.
There will be a special team of an-
nouncers and Vic Richardson is to lead
them.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: The Australian tennis
heads were relieved last week when
Stanley Youdale reconsidered his decison
not to manage this year’s Davis Cup
team. He will take on the job as before
without payment, and should add 20 per
cent, to the efficiency of the side, as he
did last time.

alarums and excursions. Sydney Asso-
ciated News, which never misses a chance
of getting an advertisement out of
the athlete of the hour, at once bellowed
the news that it was sending Hopman as
a war correspondent to the Wimbledon
front in order that he should be handy
to take his place, if required, in the Davis
Cup team. In reply, the A.L.T.A. has
acidly announced that the young gentle-
man will not be allowed to do anything
of the kind without special permission
following on a properly respectful request.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: The grading of N.S.W.
tennis players for the season is naturally
headed by Crawford, with McGrath fol-
lowing. The placing of Dunlop and
Thompson ahead of Walker will not pass
muster as easily. Moore is sixth, and
then follow A. Willard, Donohue, Rogers
and Chrystal. With the girls it was a
question of Miss Hartigan first and the
rest nowhere.
* * * *
“Fleet Street”: One Australian vogue
has made great strides in England—the
flat-topped racquets favored by Crawford
on the last tour. Crawford entered the
semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1932, but
nobody followed his racquet fashion. Last
year he pulled off the big event —result,
the flat-topped racquet has spread
through all strata of tennis players.
What’s more, the racquets come from
Australia.

“Sturt”: The team from Lower North,
which won the women’s half of a large
and representative “country” tennis tour-
nament in Adelaide, was made up of
four sisters Angel.
“Dal”: “S.T.S.” (B. 31/1/’34) slips
when he pairs the South Australian R. V.
Thomas with Patterson as a winner of
the doubles at Wimbledon. I was there
in 1919 and saw Ron Thomas and Pat
O’Hara Wood win. Patterson and Nor-
man Brookes were on the other side of
the net. It was an all-Australian final,
the umpire being Cam Hammond, who
has officiated in many a championship
game in Australia.

“Canny Lad”: The most important
feature of modern games is the box-
office. It is gratifying to hear, then, that
the Frenchmen have cabled that they will
pay 30,000 frogskins for the appearance
of our Davis Cup team in the French
championships and a minimum of 25,000
for a match against France. Last year
the terms were the same, and the inter-
national match drew a gate 6f 41,000
francs.
* * * *
“Milton”: Australian representation at
Wimbledon and in the French champion-
ships will be strengthened by the presence
of Moon, of Queensland, who has de-
cided to make the European tour as a
freelance with the aid of the Q.L.T.A.
Moon was shaping in good style with the
Davis Cup team of 1930 when an injured
knee practically outed him for the rest
of the tour. The young man’s partner in
many mixed-doubles championships, Mrs.
Molesworth, will also be playing in
Europe this season, and Queenslanders
expect both to do big things in London
and Paris.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Wombat”: Few unprejudiced golfers
will deny that the Australian practice of
encouraging Visitors on every occasion
for the sake of getting extortionate green
[fees out of their introducers is one of
the crosses that subscribing club members
have to bear. It is gratifying to read that
more and more English clubs, in these
days when everyone attempts to be a
golfer of some sort, are banning visitors
altogether or rigidly restricting their
introduction. If a club cannot find
enough members to maintain it with their
subscriptions it should put the shutters
up. As for people who wish to enter-
tain non-members at the expense of their
fellow-members, there are excellent public
courses easily accessible in most of the
Australian capitals.
* * * *
“Sandy Gallop”: Queensland is chuck-
ing a larger chest in the world of golf
and is emulating its southern neighbors
this season by starting a close and a coun-
try championship. The close title will
be played for by amateurs and profes-
sionals residing in Queensland over 72
holes, the country championship by ama-
teurs over 36 holes, only members eligible
for country-week events being permitted
to compete.
* * H= *
“Miami”: Reference to Joe Kirk-
wood’s golfing average in Roosevelt’s
Own Country (B. 7/2/’34) reminds me
that Gene Sarazen, in a ranking list of
the ten best American players, places Joe
third. Walter Hagen has to be content
with seventh place.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: It will do no harm if
the dread of lightning (B. 7/2/’34) does
discourage the use of steel shafts for
golf clubs. People who have been using
the steels continuously have found a
catch in them. The peculiar behavior of
the metal as compared with hickory has
had a very marked effect on the muscles
of the arms and shoulders, so much so
that golfing doctors are advising a return
to the wooden shaft. A rumor has been
spread of late years that no more first-
class hickory is available in the world.
The American forestry department has
countered with a statement that it has
millions of feet of it constantly available.
Further, a South African wood is being
“W-who’s that laughmg over there?"
“The girl friend. Couldn’t afford to take her to a show this week."
experimented with in England which has
all the good qualities of hickory in addi-
tion to a strength allowing shafts to be
considerably reduced in diameter.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: New attractions for the
Melbourne centenary golf spree continue
to crop up. General Grimwade has pre-
sented a gold cup, to which a purse for
the professionals will be added, the com-
petition to be played at the Peninsula
club, Frankston. The show will be held
from November 28 to December 1, and
this will give all international visitors a
chance to hop in, since the international
tourney at Metropolitan, which begins
November 12, ends 10 days later.
* * * *
“Sandringham”: The Victorian women
golfers have announced that they have
now enough brass in the stocking to im-
port a team of English golferettes, and
are confident that a team will come this
way late this year or early in 1935. It
will play in all the States, in addition to
taking part in an international match.
Mona MacLeod is due to visit Britain
this year, and has a special mission to
induce leading British players, particu-
larly Di Fishwick and Molly Gourlay,
to make the trip.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: Malcolm Campbell has at
last made up his mind as to where he will
stage his next shot on the world s speed
record for the flying mile. It will be the
Salduro lakebed in Utah (U.S.A.), and
now Daytona, the Maonland Nmety-
mile Beach and Lake George in N.S.W.
can cease their clamormgs. Campbell has
to beat his own 272.11 m.p.h. , a ” d
says he will do 300 this time All the
same it looks as if the limit in land speed
is approaching. It isn’t a matter of
power to drive the car or human capacity
to guide it —the problem is to make
tyres which will stand the tremendous
stress of these high speeds.
**■ * *
“Brooklands”: Though it is over-
shadowed in popular esteem by the
glamor of the world’s flying-mile record,
the most difficult of records to make and
break is the mileage for the hour. It is
a little over 20 years since the English
driver Lambert did 103 miles 1470
yards. The other day, George Eyston,
another Englishman, brought up new
figures with a trifle over 133 miles for
the hour —from a standing start, it
should be said.
“Hotham”: Senior’s win in the senior
division of Phillip Island Grand Prix for
motor-cycles (B. 7/2/’34) was specially
praiseworthy. His A.J.S. 495-c.c. did the
run in 80min. 55sec., not only a record for
the race, but for the course. The actual
distance covered was 105.1 miles, aver-
aging 77.9 m.p.h. This is a trifle over the
record figures for the Phillip Island
200-mile G.P. for cars, which were put
up by W. B. Thompson in his _ Bugatti
when he averaged 76.22 m.p.h. in 1932.
Thus there seems to be little difference
in sustained speed over a hundred miles
between the small-engined motor-cycle
and the big Bugatti. But it must be re-
membered that the air resistance in the
case of the motor-cycle was a fraction of
that encountering the big car.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: Sydney motor-cyclists
of the years when machines of the kind
were about as popular as they were odori-
ferous gathered together the other day
to celebrate past deeds and discuss them
in terms of artistic verisimilitude. They
recalled the long-dead past when F. S.
Roberts drove a motor-quadricycle from
Sydney to Broken Hill, via Adelaide, and
was popularly compared to the Devil
going through Athlone. Other heroes of
the past were Arthur Biden, who turned
from cycling successes to triumphs on
the puffing billies ; Fred Berry, a former
maker of records ; the Benstead brothers,
and many others of the clan. The meet-
ing and the dinner are to be held annu-
ally, and there is to be a special trophy
for presentation to the old-timers —
whether for riding motor-cycles or reel-
ing off the most convincing tale of past
performance is not stated.
* * * *
“En Plein”: Though no Australians
will figure in the 1934 Tour de France, it
is likely that the 1935 race will see a
British Empire team taking part. Bruce
Small, who is managing Hubert Opper-
man in his rides abroad this year, is
arranging for a composite Empire side of
proved long-distance men. Opperman,
Nicholson and Lamb are the Australians
mentioned. Rossiter, the road-rider and
holder of the Land’s End to John o’
Groats record, and Frank Southall are
the English contingent, and another is
Peden, of Canada. To make up the
octette two others are needed, and it is
hoped South Africa will supply these.
Miscellaneous
“Spare Walton”: Writer has contended
for years that sections of the Australian
coastal waters contain deep-sea fish as
sporting as those which attract hordes
of tourists to Maoriland, California or
Florida. Now a party of enterprising
fishermen from Victoria have wiped the
eye of their N.S.W. cobbers by invading
the Ma State and discovering an ideal
fishing-ground for swordfish of several
species, giant kingfish, sharks and all the
other game fish which bring so many
tourist shekels to Maoriland pockets.
For years one or two enthusiasts have
been proving that there are grounds
almost as good much nearer Sydney than
Montagu Island, on the far South Coast,
where the Victorians have located their
fishing paradise, but there has never been
an organised attempt to advertise them
at home or abroad. The Victorians are
not likely to let the matter rest, and it
should not be long before Ma
finds them busy making profits
out of N.S.W. waters.
* * *
“Spinnaker”: The first race for
the America’s Cup will be sailed
off Rhode Island (U.S.AO on
September 15. The rules, which
have stood for the best part
of a century, have at last been revised,
and the challenger from Britain has been
given at least a sporting chance of bring-
ing home the bacon ; also the mechanical
sail-hoisting devices introduced by the
Yankees on the last occasion have been
barred as alien to the spirit of yachting.
The revision will enable the British to
substitute a new challenger for the first,
if desired, and the British yachts may now
be sailed against each other to deter-
mine the challenger. Under the old rules
the challenger had to be named five
months before the race, while the Ameri-
can defender need not be named until
just before the starting gun. All the
same, the fact that the challengers have
to cross the Atlantic under their own
sail is a handicap. The America, winner
of the first cup, was a big, seagoing
schooner of 171 tons. The modern rac-
ing machines which have to make the
passage to the States under jury rig are
always a potential danger to their crews
and have to be escorted by steam vessels.

“Old Q.”: Commenting on that South
Australian rowing case where a member
of the crew who had broken his oar
dived overboard to get out of the way
of his fellows (B. 14/2/’34), a Sydney
journal asserts that no parallel case has
occurred in N.S.W. rowing. There was
one instance at least on the Parramatta.
In 1890 a Queensland four rowed a
N.S.W. crew, the meeting of inter-State
fours being an annual event in those days.
W. Molle, rowing bow, broke his oar and
took to the water. It was the recognised
thing to do in those days.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE IEM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL.
SMALL CLIPS.
“Ripe Corn”: It takes years of study
amongst wool to know it thoroughly, and
a man who cannot tell spinning qualities
is not competent to handle wool in
owners’ interests. Clips, even on adjoin-
ing selections, vary according to breeders’
ideas on the use of either fine-, medium-
or strong-wool rams. No. 1 selector,
whose sheep are mostly fine-woolled, will,
unless the sheep are classed, produce a
percentage of medium to strong wool.
The classer who knows his work will
not mix fine and medium in this clip. He
will run his top line 70’s and better, his
other lines accordingly, and keep a sepa-
rate line for medium to strong wool,
even if it is a star line. This sells just
as well in the “stars” when evenly
graded.
On no account should short medium or
strong wool be mixed with short fine
wool. It ruins the price of the fine, for
which there is always a special demand.
Speculators buy the mixture, re-sort it and
sell at a profit—to themselves, not to the
grower.
No. 2 selector may have a clip of
mostly medium type with a good per-
centage of fine wool. In a small clip,
the classer will run his top line 64’s-70’s
and other lines accordingly. He will keep
all broad 64’s and 60’s separate—they
will mostly be in star lots, but his pro-
cedure makes for reasonably even lines.
It is quality mixtures which result in
buyers’ complaints and selectors’ losses.
Only knowledge which can select various
spinnings at a glance can avoid the
trouble.
POINTS IN DRENCHING.
“Leo Lear”: Why this fear of drench-
ing sheep? I have drenched, dosed and
inoculated thousands with no loss. The
secret of the business is to follow, the
advice and prescriptions given by your
Department of Agriculture—it usually
knows the job. Apart from this, my
advice is never to use an arsenic drench ;
it is dangerous stuff at any time. Blue-
stone is different, and every sheep farm
should have a hundredweight of pow-
dered copper sulphate on hand. For
footrot, drenching, fluke, snail destruc-
tion, spraying, etc., it is invaluable and
cheap.
For worm-dosing six-month-old lambs
dissolve loz. to lgal. of water, and give
2oz. of the mixture. Younger lambs
should have loz.; older sheep 2oz. of
double-strength mixture.
Yard the sheep overnight, drench
them while standing and don’t allow
access to food or water for two hours.
The losses won’t frighten anyone.
DEHORNING DAIRY CATTLE.
“Mercury”: The remarks of “Baldy”
(B. 3/1 / ’34) on dehorning apply mostly
to beef cattle, but the dehorning of dairy
cattle is even more important. Most
dairy cattle are yarded twice daily. It
is in the yards that damage to stock is
done. Many a good butter-producer has
been ruined for life by the horn of a dud.
If a dairyman has worked with a
dehorned herd he soon learns how
the operation “civilises” cows. A herd
of 50 will be comfortable in a small yard,
where 15 horned beasts would not settle
down. Cows left in the bails, while atten-
dants have turned their attention to
other things, have often been jabbed
seriously by vicious animals from the
yard.
The simplest and most humane way to
do the job is to rub the caustic stick
round the base of the rudimentary horns,
before the calves are six weeks old.
MIX YOUR OWN LICK.
“Namoey”: A mineral lick is needed
on every farm to make up the natural
deficiency in the average Australian pas-
tures.
The following is reliable, varied to the
special needs of the different domestic
animals. It has the endorsement of the
Roseworthy Agricultural College, S.A.:
Sheep. Cattle. Pigs,
p.c. p.c. p.c.
Superphosphate • • 40 50 40
Salt .. ... •• 50 40 20
Charcoal, (powdered) ..
Epsom salts .. .. 5 5 5
Sulphate of iron 2 5 5
Quantity of mixture to be
fed per day when
hand-feeding, per head loz. 4oz. Ito 2oz.
Asa lick for depastured sheep and cattle
the ingredients should be first well mixed
together dry. Then a solution of water
and molasses is added until the mixture
becomes a sticky but crumbly mass. It
is then packed in shallow boxes, which
are placed where the sheep or cattle, as
the case may be, can have access to it.
No ill effects were observed at Rose-
worthy from the use of super, in the licks.
Indeed, in feeding tests, pigs absorbing
loz. of super, per day made a larger
increase in weight than those supplied
with sterilised bonemeal or ground rock
phosphate, or the controls which had
no mineral supplement.
WHEAT AT LONGERENONG.
“Curlew”: At this Vic. college for six
years averages have been: Gurkha
34.6 bushels, Free Gallipoli 33.8, Nizam
33.4, Mogul 33.3, Wannon 33 and
Federation 31.7. Over a permd of 21
years, a no-manure plot has given 33.4
bushels per acre; super., 36.5;
super, lcwt., 37.7; super., 2cwt., 38.8.
Last year the average for the farm
(520 acres) was 45 bushels. Where wheat
has been grown on the same land year
after year, the average has been only 10
bushels; where it alternates with bare
fallow, 31.6; other alternations give the
following results:
Bushels.
Wheat-pasture-bare fallow .. .. 33.8
Wheat-barley-peas 25.7
Wheat-oats-peas .. .... • • 25.6
Wheat-oats-pasture-bare fallow .. 34.0

The use of pasture to increase humus
in the soil and improve its water-holding
capacity is proved.

WHEAT-POISONING.
“Bioko”: “W.D.” (B. 24/l/’34) sub-
scribes to the hard-to-kill and extremely
pernicious theory that horses suffering
from wheat-poisoning should be denied
water. My long experience goes to prove
that this is one of the surest ways of los-
ing an animal griped through eating
wheat. R. N. Johnstone, B.V.Sc., of
the veterinary staff, Vic. Department of
Agriculture, says:
A horse secretes and swallows about six
gallons of saliva daily, aad this, together with
digestive juices met with in the stomach, will
swell the grain to its utmost extent. Water
when swallowed by a horse does not all re-
main in the stomach; the greater quantity
passes directly on to the caecum, or water gut.
.... Water is beneficial in all cases, as it dilutes
the poison and washes it out of the stomach,
so that the animal should be allowed as much
water as it will drink with bicarbonate of soda
added.
Further, Dr. W. T. Kendall, of the
Veterinary Research Institute (Vic.),
showed conclusively by exhaustive experi-
ments that horses suffering from wheat-
poisoning should be given water freely.
“BLUE PANICUM.”
“Morobe”: “Blue Panic,” a native
grass which is rapidly gaining popularity

Brought to Queensland from the N.T.,
of which it is a native, it shows itself, in
drought and early spring, far superior to
any other native grass.
Seed planted at the end of March,
1933, after dry weather and an early
winter, was nearly 4ft. high on July 21,
in marked contrast to an adjoining pad-
dock of dried-up Rhodes grass. To-day,
at the Gayndah Rural School, most of
the experimental grasses are dead from
the intense heat and the recent dry snap,
but the Blue Panic is several feet high
and green. After a scrub fire last
December, although the roots of the
Rhodes grass in an adjoining paddock
were burnt out, those of the Blue Panic
produced a fresh growth, without rain.
In tests conducted in America, Blue
Panic heads the list of drought-resistant
grasses sent over by the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Agrostologist, so it is quite on the
cards that we shall soon be buying the
product of Australia under a Yankee
label. The seed germinates freely from
the droppings of cattle, so it is easily
established. Bullocks rush the grass with
their ears back.
A. A. Petrie, of Gayndah (Q.) —his
ancestors arrived in Queensland in 1838,
so he should know something about his
native State —has been experimenting for
some time past with this and other in-
digenous grasses, and is a strong sup-
porter of varieties of saltbush which, he
believes, could be successfully dis-
seminated throughout most grazing areas.
To the slogan “Wear More Wool” might
well be added, at any rate in drier dis-
tricts, “Cultivate More Native Grasses”
in lieu of “soft” foreign grasses which
will not stand up to drought conditions.
THE ART OF RAT-CATCHING.
“Decumanus”: Rats are expensive
guests on any farm. They breed at three
months, bear in three weeks and have
from six to 14 or more in a litter, seven
or eight litters in a year. They carry
serious diseases, and do untold damage to
crops and cane. They are experts at con-
cealment—many a farmer who is losing
anything up to £IOO a year from their
depredations will swear that there isn’t a
rat on the place. To one such, I once
showed 28 as the first day’s catch, and
132 for a week, all from house, barn,
pigsty, fowlrun and cowyard.
Make a careful, systematic search for
all holes, tracks and runways, alow and
aloft, in and about all buildings. Clear
burrows by flooding with water until
quite full, with a couple of active dogs or
boys to kill bolters. Alternatively, carbon
bisulphide or sulphur fumes blown into
the burrows with bellows will shift them.
Then plug the burrows with glass or
cement, and block off all access to or
through buildings with strips of flat g.-i.
well fixed. Use poison wherever possible
—loz. of arsenic well mixed with lib. of
tallow and some Prussian blue. To avoid
accidents to stock or children, baits can
be put out in covered boxes with a 2in.
by 3in. hole in each side at ground level.
Rats won’t go into a box with only one
hole in it.
The best traps are rabbit traps, pre-
ferably the 5in. size, set longitudinally
in runways, with a light trail of bait —
breadcrumbs, wheat, oatmeal, sunflower
seeds, etc. —up to and across the plate.
Sprinkle fine dirt over the trap and
plate, and don’t handle it or bait. If
you must, rub your hands well with
earth first to kill the man smell. Wash
off any blood on a trap and rub well
with earth. Set the traps well away from
holes, near and parallel to a wall, and
lean a box or plank over each. Watch
and clear them regularly. Where neces-
sary, traps can be set in boxes as de-
scribed for baits. A signal arm can be
attached with a wire to the trap jaw
to show when it has sprung. The best
killer for a free rat is a supple cane, or
3ft. of h.t. fence wire doubled and
twisted, with a 2in. loop at the business
end.
Once the rat campaign has begun,
keep on all the year round, watching
constantly for new arrivals. Never allow
a rat that can be killed to-day to live
until to-morrow. And don’t place the
least reliance on the cat.
MARROW-STEM KALE.
“Hatter”: Marrow-stem kale (chou
moellier) is one of the most useful
winter-feed crops for all classes of stock.
It can be carted out to the paddocks for
cows and has the advantage of not taint-
ing the milk. It can be fed off by sheep ;
or, split down the middle of the stem,
makes good poultry food.
The crop is subject to attack by the
turnip fly, but otherwise gives little
trouble on good, well prepared soil. It
requires lime ; and, since it produces an
enormous quantity of feed, it takes a
good deal out of the land and must be
well fed.
For sheep, sow 31b. to the acre in drills
about 15in. apart. Merely harrowing
across will thin it out sufficiently. For
cattle, larger plants are obtained by
singling to 12in. and sowing more lightly
in drills about 2ft. apart. A suitable
dressing would be, per acre, 2cwt. to
3cwt. super.; lcwt. to 2cwt. s. of potash
and lcwt. to 2cwt. s. of amm. Most of the
super, and potash should be sown first;
a small quantity with the seed, and the
s. of amm. as a top-dressing when the
plants are established.
When the leaves are to be gathered
for cattle it is better to cut rather than
to pull them, as pulling may destroy the
second growth.
THE FARM BLACKSMITH’S SHOP.
“Eureka”: Erect it near the implement
shed, using split timber. A shop about
12ft. square is large enough for the aver-
age farm. You will need a small forge
with blower and a small anvil, which can
be set up on a block of timber at a
convenient height; and, near the anvil,
a small cask of water. A couple of pairs
of tongs, hammers of various size, cold
chisels, cutters, a bench fitted with a small
vyce, a supply of bar iron and minor
items like bolts, nuts and nails are also
wanted. As you need other tools you
will find that you will be able to make
many of them.
For the fire, charcoal will produce all
the heat necessary, and any man is cap-
able of converting old useless dry timber
into charcoal. Collect any old bits of
scrap-iron, wire, etc., about the place or
along the roads and you will soon have
a valuable stock of odds and ends.
Broken machinery can be mended,
ploughshares kept sharp, picks repointed
and dozens of other jobs done in the farm
smithy. It’s a good place to put in a
useful day’s work on a wet day. Every
farmer can make himself a good rough
blacksmith, and possibly a farrier, too.

This label

a scrap of paper
The “Cyclone” label on your roll of fencing is your definite guarantee that
you have bought the very strongest fencing that is made. It means that your
fencing •will be absolutely stockproof, practically everlasting, and completely
free of costs for maintenance or repairs. Here are two simple tests that prove
your wisdom in ordering “Cyclone” Ringlock.
Test No. i
THE “RESILIENCE TEST” (see sketch and arrows). After straining
to the correct tension, grasp the top and bottom wires firmly, and bend
them towards each other, forcing the top wire down and the bottom wire up.
You won’t be able to make much impression on a “Cyclone” Ringlock
fence, because the upright wires are so strong and resilient that when you
let it go it will spring back to its original position without distortion.
“Cyclone” Ringlock is the fence with backbone ; only HARD steel wire
is used throughout.
Test No. 2
THE “JOINT TEST.”—Grasp an upright wire above and below a joint
(see sketch), then wrench the upright
first one way and then the other.
You’ll never shift the Ringlock joint.
It’s rigid and immovable. “Cyclone”
Ringlock is the ONLY fence made
throughout of HARD steel wire. It is
absolutely unaffected by weather ; the
longer the fence is erected the tighter
the joints become.
There is the correct type of “Cyclone”
Ringlock for every class of fencing (sheep,
lambs, cattle, horses, pigs). For paddock
subdivision—whether temporary or per*
manent —“Cyclone” Ringlock fence stands
alone.
“CYCLONE!" is not a “type" of fence, but
is our registered trade mark, and can only be
legally applied to fencing manufactured by us.

SPARE THE LUBRICANT - SPOIL THE MOTOR
HINTS FOR THE FARM
“Wilfremon”: A farmer of Warrackna-
beal (Vic.) claims to have found the anti-
dote for wheat-poisoning. A pint of
vinegar is mixed with a half-pint of milk,
and the mixture is given as a drench.
“Valerin”: For a cheap and effective
rabbit fumigant, carbon bisulphide is hard
to beat. As a base use scraps of wool,
rolling them into balls the size of a hen
egg. Tie with strong cotton thread and
pack closely in an airtight can. Cover
the wool with the bisulphide-carbon solu-
tion and let it soak for a few minutes.
Drain off. Put on the lid securely. Put
a ball well down each burrow entrance
and block up securely, making sure the
earth does not cover the ball. If the
work is done systematically and the area
well dogged this process will get rid of a
high percentage of rabbits.
“J.M.”: Don’t stop at the first sign of
sand when boring for water. Keep on
till the auger comes up empty and clean.
This indicates a good stream. If you are
putting down an artesian point, keep
driving it into the sand until the pipe takes
water as fast as it can be poured from
a kerosene-tin. On no account put your
pump on until you have obtained this, or
the fine gauze of the point will become
clogged and will have to be withdrawn
and cleaned —no easy job.
“H.”: Get “hungers” from the China-
man to scare the birds. They don’t
like the smell, and the aroma of a
hunger hangs in the air longer than that
of a cartridge.
“Tinaxe”: To preserve wheaten and
oaten hay from the ravages of rats, mice
and weevils is not expensive. Sulphur
and salt —both good additions as a stock
diet —do it. A 50-50 mixture (by bulk)
is the most economical. Mix in a small
wash tub or other shallow container.
Before placing any hay in the shed, throw
over the floor just enough of the mix-
ture to £ive it a good dust covering. Over
every load, as it is put in, throw a few
handfuls till shed is full. I have examined
hay thus preserved for five years and
found it perfect without the loss of a
grain.
“Pumps”: The orthodox position for a
pump is over the supply with a vertical
suction pipe. There is no need for this.
You may take your suction pipe along
the ground round as many corners as
you wish for hundreds of feet —provided
the line falls all the way—and put the
pump-handle in the house or barn or
elsewhere. And you can introduce a “T”
piece and have two or more pumps in
different places drawing through the same
pipe line. This is not to say that your
overhead tank reticulation is out of date,
but labor-saving installations are often
not warranted.
“G.W.F.”: To preserve maize: As soon
as the grain is shelled from the cob
and is quite dry spread about .15 or 20
bushels out on a clean, hard, covered
surface out of the wind. Place a man
with a shovel on each side of the heap,
a third man spreading the lime at the
rate of one pint to one bushel. As the
lime is gradually spread over the maize
the men with shovels will mix it as if it
were concrete. Bag the maize as soon
as mixed. We have kept maize preserved
in this manner in good condition for
nearly three years. Portion of this lot
we used for seed, as an experiment, and
got a 75 p.c. germination.
A WEEKLY PRIZE FOR A HINT.
Hints for farmers have always been a popular
feature of the Man on the Land Page, and the
little volume of them published by The
Bulletin has had a wide sale.
Lately, the supply appears to have dried up
somewhat, and in order to encourage a re-
newal of the flow The Bulletin has decided
to offer a regular weekly prize.
In addition to space rates, which, will be
paid for all hints published, £1 Is. will be paid
for the best hint of the week.
Hints should not exceed 100 words in length.
Every land man has some method or con-
trivance about his place calculated to make
work easier or farming more profitable. Give
the other chap a chance to benefit by your
experience through the Man on the Land Page.
“Milton”: To make a wire cable for
suspending flood-gates in a fence crossing
a creek or for a small suspension bridge,
jack up the wheel of a dray or waggon,
attach four fencing-wires of required
length, one each to the north, south, east
and west spokes at felloe ; the free ends
of wires are made fast to a bag of
earth or log placed at right angles to the
wheel. Revolve the wheel slowly and
the wire twists. Sections of the cable
will make handy trace-chains if a piece
of old rubber hose is pulled over them
to prevent chafing horse.
“Andel”: For greasy-heel, place bits of
old leather in a tin on the fire till they
roast to a powder. Make this into a
paste with turpentine and apply. I have
used the recipe with success.
“Valerin”: The poking-stick is too
much used in urging sheep through the
drafting race and loading on to railway
trucks. Besides hurting the animal it
damages the wool and skin and reduces
the value of the meat. A man who knows
his job should not want the stick.
“Butterbox ,? : To keep butter solid in
the hottest weather fill a large wooden
box with eight inches of coarse sand.
For the butter, place a large biscuit-tin
in the centre. Fill all round with
coarse sand to within of top of tin.
The box must be big enough to allow at
least 6in. of sand all round the tin.
Cover the top of the box and tin with
doubled wheat-bags. Keep in the shade,
water the sand all round each day and
keep the bags on top damp. The butter
inside will remain perfectly solid with the
temperature outside at llOdeg. in the
shade.
“Handy”: Here’s a good hand-
protector against both needle and twine
for grain-bag sewers: Cut a thumb-hole
in one end of a strip of pliable leather
moderately soft, about 4in. wide, and of
a length determined by the size of the
prospective user’s hand. Wrap around
the hand and cut another hole at the
other end for the thumb. Make the fit
comfortable. In the centre of the palm
of the protector rivet a penny made con-
cave to aid in pushing the needle through
a tough bag. This mitten will prove a
boon to any bag-sewer and is comfort-
able to wear.
“E.H.S.”: Give the bot-smitten nag
2 quarts of new milk and 1 quart of
molasses ; 15 minutes afterwards 2 quarts
of very strong sage tea ; 30 minutes after
the tea, 3 pints (or enough to operate as
physic) of currier’s oil. The molasses and
milk cause the bots to let go, the tea
puckers them up and the oil carries them
completely away.
“Swingle”: For lubricating the bearings
of slow-moving farm implements I tried
a graphite spirit-saturated solution, and
found it much better than grease or oil.
Grit and moist soil have little inclination
to stick to this substance, which does not
remain wet for more than a minute or
two, so that abrasive material is less likely
to work into the bearings, increasing
the draught and wearing away the axles.
When working land which is inclined to
be sticky, the chances of broad cultivator-
tines clogging if thinly coated with it are
greatly lessened.
“L.A.S.”: A way in which tons and
tons of surplus wheat can be used up.
All public hospitals, homes and institu-
tions throughout Australia use only white
bread. With a few simple strokes of a
pen whole wheatmeal bread could be
made compulsory for these places, and
they use an enormous quantity. Country-
wide propaganda for wheatmeal bread
would create an enormous demand, also.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
(1) How to pulp passion-fruit ? (2) Possible
markets for such pulp ? (3) Price ? —9922.
The best method of treating passion-fruit
pulp is to extract the pulp from halved fruit
with spoons and then store in a temperature
of 10 degrees F. With much propaganda over-
seas it might be possible to dispose of large
quantities. This would necessarily entail much
financial backing. It is, however, only a
“might.” Previous attempts have not been
successful.
THIS WEEK’S PRIZE HINT.
This week’s prize of one guinea
for a hint has been won by A. A.
PHILLIPS. Minilya, via Leon-
gatha, Vic.: —
This scheme has kept my herd
clear of contagious mastitis for three
years, after vaccination had com-
pletely failed:—
Prepare one gallon of wafer mixed
with one full tablespoonful of sodium
hypochlorate to each milking-machine
unit or bail.
Fill the tin at each unit 10 minutes
before you start the engine and place
each claw in the mixture, but do not
connect the rubbers, thus allowing
free entry of the disinfectant into the
“inflation.”
Before each cow is milked, let who-
ever bails her disinfect her teats; the
stripper washes them again when
he finishes. Thus the hands of both
workers and all udders are sterilised.
When the cow leaves the bails she is
protected by the washing against in-
fection by flies.
Use the solution exact strength in-
dicated. It won’t taint milk or cream
or hurt the machine cups. Sod.
hypo-chl. costs only 6s. a gallon.
After using on the udders, throw
the water on t'he floor and sweep
down drains to continue its good
work.

BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Japan’s Way
Nippon has been an imitator of Eng-
land in many ways. Britain’s post-war
monetary policy was one of deflation, and
the Japanese Hamaguchi Ministry fol-
lowed the same course. Britain returned
to gold in 1925, and, though hindered
by disastrous earthquakes, Japan removed
the embargo on gold exports in January,
1930. Three months after England aban-
doned gold in September, 1931, Japan
followed.
But the parallel diverges there. In
Japan there was a reaction from deflation
to inflation. From 1072 million yen in
1929 the gold holding declined to 425
million after the replacement of the em-
bargo. The limit on the fiduciary issue
of notes by the Bank of Japan was
raised from 120 to 1000 million yen, and,
though the right to issue this extra cur-
rency has not been largely availed of,
there was great inflation in the Budget,
and a large borrowing and public works
policy was inaugurated.
The 1933 estimates budgeted for a 50
p.c. increased expenditure over the 1931
figure and a deficit of 1000 million yen,
making a gap of 1900 million yen
between revenue and expenditure in two
years. The 1934 programme is practically
on the scale of 1933. Principal growth
in the figures was due to farm relief,
the Manchurian affair, and re-armament.
The Bank of Japan arranged to finance
the deficits, and the inflation programme
was definitely put under way following
the extraordinary session of the Diet in
June, 1932. The policy, in addition to
that already outlined, included the cheap-
ening of money, revision of the tariff,
and assistance to farmers, building
societies and any organisations capable
of increasing employment and the circu-
lation of money.
The par value of the yen is about 2s.
in gold. To-day the gold-value is approxi-
mately lOd. This aspect of the inflation is
reflected in a great increase in Japan’s
foreign trade. In 1931 there was a sur-
plus of imports amounting to 140 million
yen, followed by 67 million in 1932.
Exports during the first ten months of
1933 (1493 million yen) show an increase
of 36 million over those for the whole
of 1932, and full figures for the year
should disclose a favorable trade balance,
which will be the first since the war-time
prosperity.
Japanese wholesale prices reached their
peak in December, 1932, when there was
a great issue of paper currency. In the
next three months the bank withdrew
most of the excess issue, and a fall in
prices followed, but from March onward
there has been a steady rise. Metals, tex-
tiles and fertilisers show the greatest in-
crease.
The purchasing-power of the people,
however, has not moved up very much,
and goods for domestic consumption
show a comparatively small rise. Notwith-
standing the growth in paper-yen prices
of goods for sale overseas, Japan is in a
strong position to compete with other
countries because her currency is de-
valued three-fifths in terms of gold. The
question is whether this advantage will be
lost as labor makes more demands and
the internal purchasing-power of the cur-
rency falls away. At the present rate of
exchange Japanese male workers receive
about one-seventh of the pay of their
congeners in England and the women
one-fifth. But living is much cheaper in
Japan.
Taking 1928 as 100, the general index
of production rose from 100.7 in 1931
to 107 in 1932, while in August, 1933, it
was 130.4. In 1914 Britain supplied
India with 97 p.c. of her cotton piece
goods. In 1930-31 Japan supplied 36
p.c. Japanese rubber shoes, electrical
goods and bicycles also made a large hole
in British trade; but there have been
reprisals. India, for instance, has put a
75 p.c. duty on non-British cotton goods.
With wages so low and her currency
devalued by three-fifths, it is little wonder
that Japanese goods hurdle Australian
tariff barriers where British goods can’t
get a look-in. The curious thing is that
Japanese internal costs have not moved
up in anything like the ratio indicated
by the inflation in the foreign exchange.
So long as these costs can be kept in
check Japanese trade will continue to be
a disturbing factor in the world’s markets.
Australia’s favorable commodity
balance for the six months to December
31 was £20,553,000, as against £6,539,000
in the corresponding half of 1932. Add-
ing bullion and specie shipments the later
balance increases to £24,101,000, 'com-
pared with £9,516,000. If wool prices
hold, a surplus of exports over imports
amounting to £50,000,000 for the full
1933-34 year is possible. So far the
exchange rate remains steady at £125
Australian to the £lOO sterling.

Our wool continues to be snapped up
at the sales. Though, during the seven
months to January 31, 214,000 fewer
bales were received into store, brokers
actually sold or shipped 196,325 more
than in the same period of 1933. At Jan.
31 there were only 502,624 bales awaiting
sale, as against 912,642 in 1933. The
average Australian price for the latest
season has been 15.6 d. a pound, while
the figure for January was strong at
19.9 d.

The International Wheat Agreement is
not likely to affect Australian growers or
the Commonwealth Government very
seriously during the present season.
Australia is allowed to export 105,000,000
bushels to June 30 next. The latest esti-
mate for the year’s crop is 161,000,000
bushels, of which local consumption will
absorb about 50,000,000. That leaves
only 6,000,000 bushels unexportable
before June 30, and it may be shipped
after that as part of the 150,000,000
bushels permissible in 1934-35. The
Commonwealth’s undertaking is to take
all the wheat which growers are unable to
export.

South Aus. has had a rougher spin
than most other States ; in addition to
low prices for rural products, the seasons,
averaged over several years, have been
unkind. In 1933 there was a pleasing
all-round recovery. There were 84 fewer
bankruptcies, 2257 more wireless licenses
were issued, motor licenses moved up,
while electricity sales showed an in-
crease of 15 p.c. New buildings erected
in the Adelaide area were valued at
£650,352, as against £388,491 in 1932.
The State’s output of butter and cheese
was slightly less, but the wool sales to
date have brought more than twice the
cash into the growers’ pockets com-
pared with 1932. The output of factories
was £1,500,000 higher, 2500 more hands
were at work, and the index for manufac-
turing activity was 88, as against 76.

“El V.” on meat:
G. F. McCann is right up to a point when he
says that British home-grown meat equal in
standard to the imported article is almost un-
procurable in Britain, but “Crops” (B. 14/2/’34)
draws a wrong inference when he suggests that
the superiority over it lies with Australian beef.
There is still superior beef which sets the
standard in the British market grown in Britain,
but the bulk of the first-grade supply comes
from the Argentine, and the decline in average
British quality is due to the fact that, over
the past decade or so, the South Americans
have outbid British meat-producers for their
own bulls, thus robbing them of the most vital
factor in their breeding. Any propaganda
which suggests that the average Australian beef-
exported is equal to the world’s best is mis-
chievous. Some lines, no doubt, are all right,
but nobody can blame the British farmer for
“whining” for protection. When South Africa
showed signs of doing with wool against us
what the Argentinos have done against British
meat-producers with meat, the shout for pro-
hibition of ram exports was heard right round
this continent. Australia will presently stand-
ardise its carcasses—more is being done to-
wards it this year than at any time since the
’seventies—and, with chilling replacing freezing,
we shall soon be fighting the Argentine on better
ground than hitherto. Battles, however, are not
won by complacency and an ostrich-like attitude.
* * * *
“Tops”: A good deal of fuss was
made about that large shipment of chilled
beef from Brisbane by the Idomeneus.
It was not the first of its kind to leave
the port, as was generally believed. In
1908 the Marathon, of the Aberdeen
White Star line, took away a cargo. The
shippers were J. Cooke and Co. and the
Q.M.E., and the shipment was techni-
cally successful. But the quarters had to
be hung instead of stacked as with the
frozen meat which the Marathon’s cold-
store was designed for. The resulting
extra freight-cost was the reason for the
abandonment of the enterprise. Even
with modern fittings in ships specially
designed for carrying chilled meat the
question of freights is going to be a
handicap to this country, three times
further from the European markets than
the Argentine or S’Africa.
* * * *
“K.T.”: I live in the Coogee (Sydney)
postal district. The P.M.G.D. wrote to
me, incorrectly substituting Randwick for
Coogee. The local P.O. stamped across
this (its own department’s) letter: “To
avoid delay in delivery please have your
correspondence addressed to Coogee.”
That was laugh No. 1. Laugh No. 2
occurred a day later when a letter bear-
ing the correct postal address (Coogee)
arrived, together with the warning that
I must have my correspondence addressed
to Randwick. I must live in both postal
districts and yet in neither.
* * * *
“K’r’h”: To treat the sooty petrel,
which tastes like teal, chilling works are
to be erected on Flinders Island. The
plant is to have a capacity for handling
300,000 birds in the three weeks’ catching
season allowed. Tas. Health Department
is permitting the birds to be marketed
as “Puffin,” “Sea Teal” or “Game
Squab.”
* * * *
“Kariah”: “Zip’s” suggestion (B.
7/2/’34) re the market for Australian
oysters in England is not by any means
new. Writer and many . others have
toyed with the idea. Though we have
known oysters to live out of the water for
more than six weeks, the tropical tem-
peratures on the voyage home would be
one difficulty, and teaching the public
that the “R” rule doesn’t apply to Aus-
tralian oysters would be another. The
best conditions for transport are experi-
enced in the months when oysters are not
eaten in England.
* * * *
“Mat”: Maoriland knows how to
make money following motor-cars. The
Main Highways Board reports that
between October, 1931, and September,
1933, the magnetic truck picked up
12,8111 b. of metal in 5670 miles of sweep-
ing. From April 1 to September 26 last
year the truck collected 27371 b. of metal
from 1261 miles of highway.
* * * *
“Jim the Penman”: Using infra-red
photography for the first time in Aus-
tralia as an aid to the detection of for-
gery, the. Westralian police recently un-
covered a neat job in cheque manipula-
tion. A firm issued a cheque for £7, and
in addition to the handwritten matter
the amount in words and figures had been
impressed on the paper by a “protective”
device. The cheque was altered to £97,
and the photography test showed that
not only had the impressed wording and
amount been altered as well as the
written part, but that a new date had
been inserted and the number of the
cheque altered.
* * * *
“Smiler”: The custom of sending gifts
of Australian products to the Old Coun-
try appears to have sound advertising
value if properly handled. Various con-
cerns have for some time been dispatch-
ing parcels of jams, preserves, wines,
hams, etc., on behalf of Australians to
friends in Britain. I.X.L. jams and pre-
serves, Seppelt’s and Penfold’s wines and
many other lines sent are all obtainable in
English stores under the same brand and
label. Co-operation between the Aus-
tralian manufacturers and various dis-
patching bodies should also mean assist-
ance from the British housewife, especi-
ally if a booklet is enclosed with each
hamper directing her to where further
supplies are obtainable.
* * * *
“King D.”: Notwithstanding periodic
grumbles from Manchester and Bradford,
the “British Export Gazette” at least is
pleased with the headway of British trade
to Australia. British shipments of spirits,
tinplate, electrical machinery and textiles
are all up, and the “Gazette” has its eye
on the submarine telegraph cable to the
Speck, together with other developments
in the P.M.G.’s Department, as possible
absorbers of British materials.
* * * *
“Djinn”: One of the world’s greatest
engineering jobs, the laying of two pipe-
lines from Kirkuk oilfield in Iraq to
Tripoli (Syria) and Haifa on the Mediter-
ranean, at a cost of ten million pounds,
has just been finished. The line to Tripoli
is 700 miles long, and that to Haifa 80
miles further. The 12-inch steel pipes,
each 40ft. long and weighing about a
ton, were sunk in trenches the whole dis-
tance, including 300 miles of desert sand.
They were electrically welded at the
joints, then painted, tarred and wrapped
in asphalted canvas to prevent corrosion.
The oil will flow at two miles an hour
and will be delivered direct to the tankers
at the wharves. Suez Canal Co. will
lose a million a year on dues hitherto
collected on tankers passing through the
Ditch on their way from the Persian
Gulf to Western European ports.
* * * *
“Chev.”: One of the biggest traffic pro-
blems Melbourne has yet surmounted was
the transference of 54 tons of steel in one
parcel from South Melbourne to the site
of the new Bank of N.S.W. building in
Collins-street. It was a girder 66 feet
long, which is the width of Melbourne’s
main thoroughfare, and the business of
turning it round the corners required
some scientific exactitude. Motor Haul-
ages built a special truck and bogie for
the job and a Sunday was chosen. Even
so, the splinter took hours to negotiate
Spencer-street bridge, Flinders and Ex-
hibition streets; it was still meander-
ing along Collins-street after midnight.
The iron filing was made by Johns and
Waygood.

“C. 8.”: The first attempt to commer-
cialise the public sentiment connected
with Melbourne’s Shrine of Remem-
brance has arrived in the form of a bowl
with a picture of the Inner Shrine and the
Rock of Remembrance and, in large
letters above, “Porridge.” It is the pro-
duct of Czecho-Slovakia and is being re-
tailed by local firms. They are likely soon
to be made aware that there is a Shrine
Act containing a copyright clause which
says:—
Anyone who manufactures, publishes or
offers for sale any replica of the Shrine without
the consent of the trustees is liable to a penalty
of £lO.
The only bodies authorised even to issue
brochures dealing with the Shrine are the
National Travel Association and the
Orient Line.

AUSTRALIANS AS HORSEMEN
“Second Divvy” (B. 10/1/’34) started
the argument, and he possibly thought he
had finished it when he replied to “Circle
Dot” and others (B. 7/2/’34). But letters
on the subject keep pouring into the
office. The subjoined budget is from a
pile about a foot high:
“Circle Dot”: William Hatfield (B. 31/1/’34),
like “Second Divvy,” twists my words. I never
hinted at any drovers’ or musterers camp
being composed of men who could all pertorm
the feat 1 mentioned (B. 14/1/’34), any more
than I think that every officer in an Enghsn
cavalry regiment could ride one of his hunters
over Aintree. At the only G.N. Steeplechase
I have seen, out of about 40 starters six
finished. At a two-days’ camp-drafting com-
petition in the north-west of N.S.W not a man
was unseated, and only two lost their bullock.
That an Englishman was head stockman on
Wave Hill does not necessarily imply that he
is a horseman of the class I referred to. I
myself was head stockman on a N.Q. cattle
station 30 years ago, but I was never a
man like the men I named. The assertion
35t the riding of the buckjumpers in a camp
Js left to the blacks is nonsense, though I do
not wish to detract from our black boys tam
as riders My argument, boiled down, is that
the percentage of bush riders to population here
is greater than the percentage of cavalrymen
and hunting men in Britain and Ireland, and
any man who tries to compute the numbers
must agree.

we ultimately delivered at Dulkanmna sta
on the Birdsville track, the trip taking 17
weeks All our killers were thrown by the
tail, and when the outfit pulled up at Dulka
ninna we had the best slop-made droving
plant in South Aus., mostly half-broken m
brumbies Being anxious to join the Light
Horse, I went through a riding test supervised
by a sergeant-major who would give a b y
a sore back. I was informed that my horse
maXp was too crude but 1. nught improve
after a few lessons. Some time later, alter
a serious operation, I rode a buckjumper at
Mitcham camp in an old broken saddle, giving
the nrad all the assistance he required until
my condition gave out and I left, after being
with him a good 90 seconds. That instructor
cove was a Rotten Row graduate. Yet 99 px.
of the 11th Field Ambulance who saw me
ride would have granted me a pass to any
mounted corps in the world.
“Ex-L.H.”: Horsemanship, in the true sense
of the word, is the power to handle and get
the utmost out of a horse, in the everyday work
to which it is put, with the least knocking
about. In Australia there are hundreds,
thousands, of horsemen who perform feats
which would make “Second Divvy s hair
stand on end, and they don’t skite about l
either—it is merely part of their day s work.
If “Second Divvy” wants proof let him travel
through the cattle country of N.S.W. and
Queensland, visiting the mustering a.nd branding
camps in the mountainous country and on the
plains. During the Palestine campaign brasS-
hats refused to equip our Light Horse as
cavalry, their objection being that they rode
with their stirrups too long to be able to use
a sword. But after the charge at Beershe.ba
those very brasshats nearly smothered them-
selves in the rush to convert them into cavalry.
Ask Harry Chauvel, who commanded us lor
nearly four years, what he thought of us as
horsemen. He has been through the best mili-
tary schools, and he ought to be in a posi-
tion to judge. Some of the men in my regiment
rode the same horses day and night for three
Years and at the conclusion of operations the
heads complimented the Australian units on the
small percentage of their horses evacuated !
hospital through sore backs and other causes.
Not so with some of the other cavalry. After
days of hard riding I’ve seen on many occa-
sions some of them walking and leading horses
whh lumps on their backs almost the size of
a man’s fist. Why? They weren t horsemen.
“Never Again”: I have been a station man;
acer for 18 years, and have had 28 years
experience in the back country. Up till seven
vears ago I bred all my own working horses
for general station work; this practice I have
had to abandon because I could not get men
to ride the young stuff after the breaker had
finished them off. .1 now have to buy quiet
broken-in horses with a bit of age. I could

boast about our horsemen being the best

“Viator”: So William Hatfield says he could
find but one man “in all the cattle coun jt
in SO” to throw and tie a beast in fro
of his camera! One reason is that the average
S„*man "camera-shy; another rs tha Aus-
tralians—at any rate, Queenslanders •
“stunt artists”; another is that Mr. Hatneia
did not look very far. At almost any gym-
khana cattle-throwing and -tying passes as pa
Of the Show I have seen this feat performed
many a time, not only at gymkhanas but on
SKe runs and also by our tribe of poddy-
rirvHCTprs Cattle-folk are diffident, and it is
natural 'that they should refrain from exhibit-
ing their prowess before every wandering tour-
ist 8 If Mr. Hatfield were to leave his car
and the main mail tracks he might be aston-
fshed toTnd that the bulk of the work on
stations is not done “by very ordinary riders
on very ordinary hacks. In any case, southern
Queensland is not the place to
best of horses or of horsemanship. Mr. Hat
field is not a bushman, nor will he ever
one. He is a journalist who views Australia
through English eyes.
“Real Old Mackay”: Strange that none of
the contributors to this controversy has men-
tioned the greatest rider and horseman ol
his day, C. N. Armstrong. An Irishman by
birth, who learned all he knew about horses
in Australia, he happened to be in London
teaching horsemanship to an English cavalry
regiment while his wife, Nellie Armstrong,
afterwards famous as Melba, was learning voice-
production at Brussels : tnd J^Vm^WiM 8 West
Those were the days of Buffalo Bill s Wild West
show Cody had a horse about which he had
a standing offer of £5O for anyone who could
ride it. Stipulating that he was to ride in an
Australian saddle—a condition readdy granted
by Cody, who thought it was a handicap in
his favor —Armstrong took on the job. An-
other condition was that the horse was to E-
let loose in the ring and the rider had to
subdue it, bridle it, saddle it and r * d ®.
finish without assistance. In the event Ran
garoo Charlie” (as the cowboys christened
him) sat on a mass of quivering horseflesh
and was greeted generously by Cody, who
acclaimed him as the finest horseman in the
world The cowboys gave him a wonderful
ovation; but Australia lost its champion, as
Armstrong retired to the comparatively quiet
life of a ranch in Texas.
“Sixth B.”: “Second Divvy” evidently expects
to see horsemen emerging from the portals ot
department- and chain-stores. Do our mounted
Dolice count for nothing, our mounted infantry,
our polo teams? And what about the riders a
picnic races held in pretty well every smal
town and on every large. station throughout
Queensland and northern N.S.W.? Our jockeys
may be a poor lot, but what’s racecourse-riding
anyway? I’ve seen wonderful cavalry displays
on the Continent and in Britain, but my admira-
tion was given to the horses, not to the guys on
top. I saw enough to convince me that ; the
Aussie can hold his own amongst the best.
In fact, we have just as good horsemen, especi
ally rough-riders, as they produce anywhere
in the world.
“Bete”: Delving into some old minute-
books of the Waterside Workers’ Federa-
tion I came across interesting references
to two future Australian Prime Ministers
who were associated with it. One entiy
ran:
Mr Andrew Fisher moved that the president,
Mr W. M. Hughes, be authorised to hire a
typewriter for £1 10s. per month The motion
was supported by Messrs. Bamford and
Largie.
Another set forth that Mr. Hughes
suggested that he should edit the Water-
side Gazette” at £5 a month. Offer
accepted. Billy, of course, was founda-
tion president of the union, and occu-
pied the post for about 15 years.

“Nakhoda”: What is the origin of the
superstition regarding ringing glasses,
prevalent amongst professional seafarers.
I was on a tourist liner to Papua when
a steward inadvertently caused a wineglass
to ring in front of an officer at my table.
The officer hastily broke off a conversa-
tion and damped the vibrations with his
fingers. A sharp-eyed flapper observed
the action and asked the seadog why he
did it; she was told that if the glas.
were to be allowed to finish its tune some
honest sailorman somewhere >would go
to Davy Jones’s locker. The flapper
promptly began flipping her own glass
and the officer as promptly repeated his
behavior. After she had played her little
joke three or four times he ordered her
in a voice of thunder to stop it, and tor
the first time she realised he was serious
1 have heard the same belief exist,
amongst miners.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Native Wars
“Kaloa”: While the Commonwealth
Government leaves missionaries to deal
with Arnhem Land natives it seems to
have no qualms about stern measures
with Papuans who have had even less
contact with civilisation than the Aus-
tralians.
A few weeks ago Patrol-officer C. F.
Cowley, a trusted official of long experi-
ence, visited the Tinai Valley to provide
police protection for prospecting parties.
The natives there are “not under com-
plete Government control.” Some of his
carriers, taking a short cut against orders,
were attacked by the Givena tribe, and
two were killed. The native sergeant in
charge of the escort pursued the attackers
and killed four. Later in the tour, during
a sojourn with the Kagave people, a
young policeman fired his rifle in the air ;
and other constables, thinking he had
been attacked, lost their heads and killed
two natives before the sergeant could
take a hand and call them off. It is to
the great credit of the Kagave people
that they remained calm. In being on the
route which they were following the
police apparently were disobeying orders.
Later, Patrol-officer Hides visited the
same region to deal with the perpetrators
of two massacres, and in the rounding up
process lost a constable. At Baila village,
which is stockaded, when he asked for
the chief he was told to take that potentate
if he could. A brisk
fight ensued and the
chief, a doughty but
childlike warrior who
had killed four men in
battle with an axe, was
brought to Moresby,
whence he will be re-
turned to his village after
he has enjoyed the hos-
pitality of the Adminis-
tration—which does not
propose to punish him.
The reason why such
incidents can have a
happy ending in Papua is
that the Government
and the patrol men both
understand their native.
Mr. Hides said, after his
return:
Knowing the natives, one
can only have kind thoughts
of them. Once I heard about
150 of them singing in a
village four or five miles
away, and, as I listened, I
forgot all about murders and
cannibalism. I just thought
of all the beauty and
strength of the life of the
savage.
A few more Murrays and Hideses and
a few less missionaries and officials of the
two-gallon hat variety would soon mend
the deplorable native position which
exists in the Northern Territory. Under-
standing of the black viewpoint is the
first essential to successful administration
and the growth of a live-and-let-live
policy as between white and black Aus-
tralians.

The Australian Girl
“El V.”: A lot has been written about
the Australian girl. She seems, by the
papers, to be an empty-headed person in
panties and a backless bathing-costume
who spends most of her time lying on
the beach.
There are, however, others.
Gladys Lilley, for instance, who is 17
and lives out from Upper Ulam (C.Q.) on
the edge of some of the wildest range
country in coastal Queensland. Gladys
the other day wrote to the Rockhampton
“Bulletin” to explain herself. She felt that
her neighbors might think her “ridicu-
lous” because she was “lost in the ranges
12 miles from her home in a part which
she had been over many times looking
for horses and cattle.”
It appears that when she disappeared
she was riding the ranges “to ascertain
the state of grass and water.” After
traversing a tortuous route she found
that it was getting dark and, “knowing
the treacherous nature of the ranges, even
in day time, took the saddle off the mare
and decided to camp for the night.” While
Gladys calmly set about making a fire
half a dozen dingoes trotted up, and one
sat about 20 yards away snapping and
snarling.
. He was a splendid shot, and I put a bullet
into him. The mob ran away, and came back
about 20 minutes later, and they entertained me
with howling and trotting round me all night.
In the morning, when it was daylight
and a dilatory fog had cleared away,
Gladys, presumably having been without
dinner or tea, calmly saddled up and
went straight home. She found the
countryside roused and police and black-
trackers on the way to look for her. Her
brother Mervyn already had left and, as
it appeared afterwards, “picked up my
tracks and tracked me over the entire
journey,” which Gladys thinks was won-
derful as she “was winding about a good
deal.”
She was, of course, not frightened—
nobody would be in the Ulam ranges,
which are not more wild than, say, the
Hawkesbury ranges or the nether fast-
nesses of the Blue Mountains 40 years
ago. But Gladys explains it this way:
I never go out into the ranges without my
rifle; it had often been useful to me on pre-
vious occasions, but I never realised its value
as much a§ I did when I sent its message to
that big, cheeky dingo.
There seems to be an intrepid sort of
wife waiting for some pioneer up Ulam
way.
“Obsidian”: “Dajarra” (B. 24/1 /’34)
talks of the treatment of patients from
Mount Isa as one of the expenses of the
Cloncurry District Hospital. Mount Isa
has two hospitals, an up-to-date X-ray
plant and pathological laboratory with a
skilled technician, three doctors, and
quite a list of Cloncurry residents who
"Why did you make the walls lean in like that?”
“Didn’t have enough roof to put on the top.”
have been patients. G. K. Chesterton, in
“The Napoleon of Notting Hill,” has
shown the danger of inter-urban jealousy
and enmity. I hope “Dajarra’s” state-
ment will produce none of this.

“Malaguna”: A lot of the interference
by natives with white women would
cease if the Rabaul Administration would
encourage the recruiting of native women
for domestic service. It is ridiculous to
expect that there will be no trouble in
a community where boys mature young
and where the number of Kanaka men
is out of all proportion to the supply of
womenfolk. The houseboy is certainly
superior as a servant to the Mary, but
that is largely due to lack of training
of the female sex, whose employment,
apart from settling this question without
hangings and floggings, would have a big
influence in the Government’s civilising
programme.
* * * *
“Twelfth Parallel”: In B. 3/1 /’34 there
is an article, “Patrolling the Border,”
which contains admirable sentiments but
also one statement casual and mislead-
ing: “There is a garrison of 30 men idle
at Darwin.” The strength is not 30 but
60. And “idle”! That garrison is the
hardest-worked in the Commonwealth.
The men are all volunteers. Their con-
structional work is onerous, largely
manual, and occupies them from 6.45
a.m. to 1.30 p.m.; ordinary soldiering,
which is the business of a garrison in the
South, is carried out at Darwin after
working hours. The conditions are more
trying than those of any other station,
and it is unpleasant to find the efforts of
these good Australians disparaged in one
short sentence which, however well
meant, undoubtedly gives a wrong im-
pression of them and their work.
* * * *
“The Duke”: There is some stir in the
Mandated Territory because of the Com-
monwealth’s delay in ennobling the
members of the new Legislative Council,
who are mostly civil-service departmental
heads. The Rabaul “Times” quotes the
long ruling of the Dominions Office on
the use of the title “Honorable,” and
urges the satraps to “cast aside the fear
of swanking” and boldly label themselves.
Some of the local talent with a sense of
humor and an acquaintance with Austra-
lian honorables think the labelling should
be done a la King Billy on a brass plate
hung round the neck on a bit of fishing-
line. Most of the new dignitaries, how-
ever, would much prefer an extra pound
a week to a title.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Some years ago a scheme
for settling 1800 farmers in the far north
of Queensland was put forward by a
conference of which the chairman was
J. F. Currie. The idea has been re-
vived as the basis of the plans of the
Palmerston Development League and is
to be advocated in conjunction with a
campaign for a new northern State. The
movement is not the pioneer new-State
movement in N.Q. Forty years ago
northern initiative got the Leg. Assembly
to the point of passing a bill giving the
north and centre self-government, sub-
ject to a Queensland Federal Parlia-
ment ; but in the thick of the larger fight
for the creation of the Commonwealth
the effort lost its way and was never
found again.

“Daintree”: Queensland’s Main Roads
Commission has completed an aerial sur-
vey of 100,000 acres of jungle at the head
of the Tully River in N.Q. Allowing for
unsettled weather the work took only
four days. The preliminary survey has
been made with a road layout in view
and will show gullies and ridges. Subse-
quent office work on the plotting will
take two or three months. This is the
first time in Australia a ’plane has been
used for road location. The observers
worked from 10,000 ft. up. To get the
same results, a ground party in this diffi-
cult country would have taken 12 months
over the survey and a couple of years
to calculate and commit the record to
paper.

“Frigid”: Another pat on the back for
Binghi. A party of abos. carried Larsen,
a starving prospector, 47 miles from the
Ebagoolah field to Port Stewart recently,
swimming with him on a stretcher across
flooded rivers. From Port Stewart he
was taken by the steamer Wandana to
Cooktown hospital. When Larsen was
picked up he was a living skeleton. One
of the rivers crossed was shark-infested,
and the abos. would not cross it in the
dark, but bravely did so in daylight,
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Thanks to the Duchess of York, our cabinet
woods may at last come into their own. The
Government has had made for the Duchess a
jewel-case of Queensland walnut, lined with
silver ash, and with a tray of silver ash. Black
palm was used for the cartouche which deco-
rates the front, and inside the lid there is a
representation of the Queensland coat of arms,
carved from snow wood, rarest and loveliest of
our timbers. The Duchess, visiting a furniture
exhibition in London, asked why there was no-
thing there made of Queensland walnut, and
the demand which set in immediately has earned
Queensland gratitude.
Last week great lengths of hoop pine
from Yarraman, some of them 50ft. in length,
were deposited at the site of the coming addi-
tions to the Agricultural Building. The timber
will be used for the framework which will
support the crane. The present Government
uses local materials wherever possible; hence
hoop pine, instead of Oregon. Other Australian
Governments, please copy!
Mrs. L. O. Lukin, wife of the Federal Judge,
is dead. Mrs. Lukin, who was Lorna
Rennick, of Melbourne, was the English
mistress at the Brisbane Girls’ Grammar
School when she married; an M.A. of
Melbourne Uni., and a deeply cultured
woman. After her husband went south she
always spent her winters here, and kept closely
in touch with her Queensland friends. Of the
two sons, one is a medico and the other a
barrister. Both live in Brisbane, just as both
daughters, Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Allsop, live
in Melbourne. Mrs. Phillips, as Lorna Lukin,
was one of the few women architects practising
in Australia in her day.
Architecture, by the way, now has attracted
a number of women in Brisbane. There, are
one or two in the Government Architect’s
office, and Olive Cannan took down her brass
plate a year or two ago when she also de-
cided to study domestic architecture at closer
quarters. Another recruit to the profession has
appeared in the person of Joan Powell,
daughter of Lange Powell, F.R.1.8.A., for years
president of the Queensland Institute and
already twice president of its younger associa-
tion, the Australasian Institute of Architects.
Joan is learning to use the T square in her
father’s office.
The Clan McConnel, which settled at Cress-
brook in the roaring ’forties, and is one of the
few Queensland squatting tribes to retain its
original holding, has scattered far and wide
over eastern Australia. At present Mrs. Bourne
is visiting us from N.S.W., and her mother,
Mrs. Ned McConnel, has come to Brisbane
from Marshlands to be with her. The Bourne
children have been suffering from the usual
childish epidemics, and pretty “Bertie” Mc-
Connel, as Brisbane persists in calling the wife
of Colonel Bourne, has not been able to enjoy
much social life. The Bournes, too, are an old
Queensland family. G. L Bourne and J.S.P.
(father of the Colonel) were pillars of the
civil service, Mrs. J. S. P. Bourne was a founder
of the Women’s College within the University,
and one of the first women in Queensland to get
free kindergartens put on the agenda papers of
broadminded citizens. Her daughter, Dr. Eleanor
Bourne, was one of the first Queensland girls
to attend the Sydney Medical School. Inciden-
tally, she is probably the only girl on the lists
of the Brisbane Boys’ Grammar School, which
she attended for special subjects for a time.
She now holds down a responsible Govern-
ment position in England. Younger daughter
Ida was at one time Greek mistress at Rock-
hampton Grammar School.
A baby born in Sydney three years ago
weighed 270 z. He celebrated his third birthday
in Brisbane and is now exactly 301 b. Already
the lad is a confirmed globetrotter, having done
the trip from Holland to Australia and travelled
by boat up the Yangtze-kiang for about 2000
miles. He arrived by the Kamo Maru, with
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Blok. Globe-
trotting seems to be a family hobby, for papa
has been round the world 14 times, and now
seems to be getting bored with it.
T. B. Hunter, Registrar of the Dental Board
of Queensland for 30 years, who now
is retiring in accordance with the conditions
of the recently amended Dental Act, was fare-
welled almost tearfully by large quantities of
tooth-snatchers during the week. In addition
to saying nice things about him, the dentists
thrust a handsome grandfather clock on him.
Still new engagements are announced almost
daily. The depression must be over! Among
the latest for whom grocers’ and butchers’ bills
have no terrors are Doris Robinson, only chick
of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Robinson, of West End,
and F. S. Cash* whose people live at Enog-
gera. Lynda Johnson, daughter of the A.
Johnsons, of New Farm, also has a new
diamond ring, acquired for her -by Noel
Forrest, only son of Mr. and Mrs. D. C.
Forrest, of Windsor.
When Betty Ryan, of Lucknow Downs, mar-
ried E. Nelson-Turner, and went to live in the
Solomons, all her friends • wondered how on
earth she would bear life in that outpost. Their
wonderings were replied to most satisfactorily
when the lady stepped off the Malaita during
the week. She wants to buy a large quantity
of fowls while she is in Australia, and she
speaks fondly of her pure-bred Jerseys, which
all the Solomons unite in admiring. She gets
quite a lot of golf at Tulagi, where her hus-
band is stationed as Commandant of Police,
but she can’t do much motoring there, and
she intends to spend most of her vacation
speedily on the good roads of New South
Wales and Victoria.
The Ladies’ Guild of St. Mary’s, Kangaroo
Point, gave a pancake party on Tuesday night,
and large numbers of ladies did their best to
hurl limp hunks of batter in the air and catch
them again. Mrs. Crosby tossed hers with a
light and airy grace which left all the other
woman speechless; but Frank Drouyn proved
so proficient that he annexed the second
prize. Incidentally, there is money to be made
in the tossing, if you know where to go. Holly-
wood producers recently offered large sums
to any three ladies who would come and fling
pancakes about the atmosphere in a talkie that
was being filmed. In the whole of Hollywood
only one girl could be found who could flip
a natty frying-pan.
When your Show bursts upon you, you will
find a camp of young Queenslanders in its
midst. Queensland boys, between the ages of
11 and 18, chaperoned by E. R. Marie, deputy
director of the Young Australia League, who
are lucky enough to be chosen will have a
wonderful time. The programme is compre-
hensive, and a fully qualified nurse will reside
in the camp as matron, so that parents need
not worry lest the boys should not be looked
after.
Mrs. James Thorburn, who only packed her
trunks to depart to Port Sudan last Sep-
tember, arrived back in the old home town by
the Moldavia this week. Her husband will join
her in August. In the meantime, she is visiting
with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Peel,
rewelding old friendships, and doing a lot of
shopping. Shops in Port Sudan hardly exist.
Brisbane’s new Anglican Archbishop, Rev.
J. C. Wand, was popular with Diggers and
should get on quite well with the people of his
diocese. He was padre in one of the areas
inhabited by Australians, and each Sunday night
his large wooden church was crowded.

Where was Judith Anderson born and edu-
cated, and where and when did she make her
stage debut ? Who were her parents ? When
did she first appear on the stage in America ?
—216.
At Adelaide; daughter of James and Jessie
Margaret Anderson (nee Saltmarsh). Judith
was educated in Adelaide, and made her first
appearance on the stage in 1915 at the Theatre
Royal, Sydney, as Stephanie in “A Royal
Divorce.” She went to America, and made her
first appearance in New York in 1918 at the
old Fourteenth-street Theatre; she played small
parts in stock company, rising to leading parts
there in the following year.
(1) Dates of close seasons for fishing in the
Murrumbidgee River (N.S.W.) and methods of
fishing allowed and prohibited ? (2) Must a
person using a net obtain a license ? (3) Under
what conditions must a license be obtained ?
—66.
(1) Closures and methods allowed vary at
different parts of the river and its affluents, and
are too lengthy to reprint here. See “Fisheries
Gazette,” obtainable from the State Fisheries
Office, Sydney. (2) Any person not having a
license may use a lawful net in waters open
to netting for the capture of fish for private
consumption, but not for the purpose of sale.
(3) The Fisheries Act provides that any person
catching fish for sale must be the holder of a
license (cost ss. p.a.), and that every boat used
in connection with the capture of fish for sale
must also be licensed at a fee of ss. p.a.
What is the formula for finding the area of
a piece of land with four unequal sides ? —223.
If the sides are straight the angles must be
accurately ascertained with a theodolite and
the length of the - sides determined. Area is
then ascertained by dividing the space into right-
angled triangles. When sides are curved Simp-
son’s Rule is applied, practical application of
which is described in any treatise on mensura-
tion. Angus and Robertson’s table-book (3d.)
gives the elementary rules of land measurement.
(1) Is there a system of marine navigation
employing sextant, chronometer and tables that
eliminates the need for trig, calculations ? If
so. what is the system ? (2) Is it sufficiently
accurate to ensure safety in waters like Torres
Strait ? —lOl.
(1) Using observations of celestial objects,
chronometer time and elements from the Nauti-
cal Almanac and Nautical Tables, a ship’s posi-
tion can be obtained without trigonometric
calculations. The work can be set out from
the formula. (2) Yes; the ship’s position would
be fixed at frequent intervals by. bearings of
landmarks. Bearings of celestial objects in such
waters would, however, be used for the purpose
of ascertaining the error on the ships’ com-
passes.
Brief history of the Scandinavian Hall, which
used to stand at 107 Castlereagh-street, Sydney ?
—217.
It was built by William T. Johnson and
opened by him as a music hall. In the same
year (1866) Johnson opened the Scandinavian
Hotel in front of it. In 1872 William Kavanagh
kept the hotel, whilst Johnson remained pro-
prietor of the hall. In 1874 Johnny Sulli-
van, a lightweight boxer, converted the hall
into Sullivan’s Athletic Hall, but his venture
failed, and in 1875 the Scandinavian was un-
occupied. For a time it was used as a cloth-
ing factory, the front portion as a shop;
in 1878 George Gamferty conducted it as a
billiard saloon. The Bulletin occupied a por-
tion of it in 1880. In 1881 the hall was re-
named the Victoria and opened for show pur-
poses under the managership of D’Arcy Reed.
In 1882 it was renamed the Academy of Music.
In 1890 the old building was pulled down and
the Garrick Theatre (afterwards the Tivoli) was
erected on the site.
What part did Pasteur play in destroying
the rabbit pest in Australia ? —l4O.
The offer of a prize of £25,000 by N.S.W.
induced him to send three of the staff of his
institute here in , 1888 with chicken cholera.
After experiment this method was rejected.
There was another visit in 1906, with similar
results.
What is the meaning of the terms Com-
munist, Socialist, Fascist and Nazi ? 92.
Very briefly, a Communist is one who be-
lieves in “the collective ownership and man-
agement of all goods, productive sources and
rights of a community,” to be achieved by a
“dictatorship of the proletariat”—those who are
at present wage-earners. A Socialist wishes to
extend the powers of a Government elected by
all the people to such an extent as to include
ownership of all means of production, distri-
bution and exchange; a Fascist, in Italy, means
a supporter of the dictatorship of Mussolini;
in Britain, a follower of Sir Oswald Moseley;
a Nazi, in Germany, means a supporter of
the dictatorship of Hitler; in Austria, one who
desires to see that dictatorship extended to his
own country.
Procedure necessary for a student holding the
diploma of a School of Electrical Engineering
to obtain a certificate to enable him to carry
out electrical wiring work in Queensland.
9950.
A certificate of competency or service must
be held. To obtain a certificate of service an
applicant must have entered Queensland within
a period of six months, and must submit evi-
dence of having served an apprenticeship of
five years to the electrical trade together with
one year’s service as a fully-paid journeyman.
A certificate of competency is gained by exam-
ination. You apply to sit and must produce
evidence of practical experience. The holder of
a diploma in engineering of any recognised
technical college or engineering school
may apply, but must produce a certifi-
cate from his last employer that his con-
duct and work as an electrical worker have
been satisfactory. His application will then be
considered on its merits. Application form and
particulars from the Electrical Workers’ Board,
7th Floor, Taxation Bldg., Brisbane.
(1) From what places in Queensland waters
is the taking of coral prohibited ? (2) Why
was the prohibition instituted ? (3) Must per-
mission be secured to obtain coral from outside
those areas ? (4) Is there a ready sale for coral
for curio purposes ? (5) How to preserve coral ?
—9987.
(1) On the reefs and foreshores surrounding
Masthead, Heron, Lady Musgrave and Nor’-west
islands (Bunker Group); Middle and South
islands (Percy Isles); Tern and Red Bill islands
(Northumberland Islands); Scawfell, Molle,
Shaw, Lindeman, Haymen, St. Bees and Bramp-
ton islands (Cumberland Islands); Stone Island
(Edgecombe Bay); Bait Reef; and the fore-
shores and reefs of Cid Harbor, Whitsunday
Island. (2) To prevent the wholesale removal
of growing coral from the localities mentioned
in view of their growing importance as tourist
resorts. (3) Yes. A license should be obtained
from the nearest Inspector of Fisheries. (4) No
knowledge of any great demand for specimens
of coral as curios, other than by tourists who
visit the Barrier Reef waters from southern
States. (5) (a) Soak it in a tub of cold water
in the open air for three or four days, and
then rinse or hose it; or (b) boil it in water.
When the water comes to the boil put in a
small quantity of caustic soda; then boil for
a few seconds longer and afterwards rinse the
coral in cold water.
(1) Fees now payable by students attending
the day art classes in the lower and higher grades
at the East Sydney Technical College ? (2)
Can poor students obtain any reductions, and
are there any scholarships available ? —212.
(1) First-year students who qualify by test for
admission are charged £1 Is. a term; other first-
year students, £4 4s. a term. Intermediate section,
£4 4s. a term. Diploma section, £5 ss. a term.
Commercial or advertising art section, £4 4s. a
term. (2) To assist poorer students of outstand-
ing ability, there are allotted in the inter-
mediate section 10 per cent, free places, and
in the higher art section each year 5 per cent,
free places. In addition, there will be pro-
vided, from the beginning of 1935, three scholar-
ships each year. These scholarships will be
granted on bursary conditions —ability and
limitation of family income—and will carry
with them free tuition and a living allowance
similar to that granted to entrants to the
teachers’ colleges.
Excessive rains in Sydney have brought a lot
of mildew on my roses, crepe myrtle and pussy
willow shrubs. How should I treat them ?
158.
Dust the affected shrubs (especially on the
white powdery substance) with sulphur, and
spread it on the soil at the base of the plants.
A warm morning, after the dew has evaporated,
is the best time for the work. Do not water
the shrubs during the treatment. Give an-
other dusting in about 14 days; generally it
takes two or three treatments to get over the
trouble.
Best treatment for dahlia plants which
flowered early and are now run to excessive
wood wifhout blooms ? —144.
Cut them down to the two laterals near the
base of the plants. Give the plants plenty of
liquid manure when the laterals get going, and
provide stakes to which they can be tied as a
precaution against winds. When dahlias are
allowed to make too much small-limb growth
they seldom bloom profusely.
Some details concerning Pithecanthropus
erectus ? —207.
It is the name given to the remains of a man-
like skeleton found in 1891 by Dubois in vol-
canic tuffs of probable Pleistocene age, near
Trinil, Java. The relics discovered were the
roof of a skull, two molar teeth and a femur,
the abnormal form of which indicated that its
possessor walked erect. The forehead was
low, frontal ridge prominent and brain capacity
two-thirds that of the average man. The charac-
teristics, in general, indicated a type between
man and his more remote ancestry, which is
supposedly not simian, but an independent
phylum.
Who invented the parachute and who first
descended safely in one from a balloon ? —2OO.
The invention is credited to Leonardo da
Vinci (1452-1519), who made a drawing, but
this may have been suggested by a design of
Fausto Veranzio in Machine Novae N 385).
The honor of being the first balloon parachutist
is credited to Andre Garnenn, who descended
over Paris on Oct. 22, 1797.
Origin of the word “robot” ? 190.
It is derived from a Czecho-Slovakian
word meaning “work,” which has_ passed
into current usage since 1923, the year
when Karel Capek’s play R - u - R - Kos-
sum’s Universal Robots ) was translated
into English by Paul Selver. The play por-
trayed a society dependent on the work ot
mechanical men. Robot mechanisms have been
used to steer ships without human aid (1927), to
operate telephone transmitters (1927), and to
pilot aeroplanes (1931).
Which had the longer continuous run in
Australasia, “Rose Marie or Our Miss
Gibbs” ? —9957.
“Rose Marie” holds record for continuous
run in Australasia of more than two years, 317
performances being given in Sydney on its first
presentation. “Our Miss Gibbs ’ ran 229 per-
formances in Sydney on its first showing, but
did not tour Australasia as one unit— ine
Onaker Girl” was added to the repertoire tor
the tour.
One of the portraits of Governor Macquarie
in the Mitchell Library, Sydney, is painted by
a man named Opie. Who was he, and were his
works distinguished in any way? —lsl.
John Opie was a Cornish painter who first
exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1782. He
was known in artistic circles of his day as the
“Cornish Wonder.” His first exhibited work,
which appeared in an annual show of the In-
corporated Society of Artists, attracted con-
siderable attention because it was described as
the work of a young artist who had never seen
a picture. Peter Pindar wrote that he came
from the Cornish sawpits and “there is a
maturity and judgment, a truth and force ot:
coloring in his portraits which are astonishing.
Opie painted portraits of the Duke and
Duchess of Gloucester and was described by
his friends as having great simplicity and good
sense despite the fulsome praise of the critics.
At 21 he put his name down as candidate for
the A.R.A., and was elected four years later.
He received commissions from George HI., and,
although his popularity declined somewhat
rapidly and stayed so for many years, it rose
again late in life. His portraits of that time
are considered to be excellent likenesses.
Did Charles Kingsley, author of “Westward
Ho,” write a novel founded on Australian life ?
—137.
No, but his younger brother Henry, who
emigrated to Australia, used his experiences in
the writing of “Geoffrey Hamlyn” (1859) and
“The Hillyars and the Burtons” (1865).
Brief history of Alfred Dampier the actor ?
—241.
Born London, 1847; educated at the Charter-
house. First appearance on stage at Stratford-
on-Avon; subsequently travelled English pro-
vinces. In 1872 he was engaged by H. R. Har-
wood to play in Melbourne, where he first
appeared as Mephistopheles in his own version
of “Faust.” For three years he played lead-
ing Shakspearean parts in Melbourne, and then
returned to England. A little later he returned
to Australia, leased a theatre in Melbourne, and
produced in it (and in many other Australian
and M.L. towns) a series of Australian plays,
of which the most noteworthy was founded on
Rolf Boldrewood’s “Robbery Under Arms”
(written in conjunction with Garnet Walch).
Two of Dampier’s daughters, Lily and Rose,
shared in his successes, and were regarded as
competent actresses. He did not confine him-
self to melodrama, but for many, years was
the only manager (except George Rignold) who
kept Shakspeare’s plays before the Australian
public. He died at Sydney on May 23, 1908.
What were the exploits and the fate of Harry
Power, an early Victorian bushranger ? —231.
He was an Irishman who reached Victoria
at the beginning of the gold rush and took to
horse-stealing in 1855. He was apprehended,
sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment, and
escaped in 1869, taking to the bush
in the Beechworth district. Except for
a short raid into N. S. Wales as far as
Adelong he confined himself to this area, and
was captured in his camp near the head of
the King River on May 27, 1870. He served
a 15-year sentence, and was engaged after his
liberation to add verisimilitude to the exhibition
at Melbourne of the pseudo-convict hulk' Suc-
cess. He was drowned in the Murray on
November 7, 1891.
Who engraved and issued the first-dated
“tokens” made in Sydney ? —238.
J. C. Thornthwaite, an engraver, made tokens
of Burra Burra copper (date uncertain), which
are the earliest known. He had no press, and
cut the coins with a drop-hammer. These
tokens were issued on behalf of Samuel Peek,
a Sydney grocer, who owned tea stores and
steam coffee mills, and advertised them on his
token, placing a helmeted figure of Britannia
on the reverse.
(1) When did the trial of the members of
the recruiting ship Hopeful take place ? (2)
Result of the trial ? (3) Finding of the Royal
Commission following the trial which inquired
,nto the conduct of labor-recruiting vessels in
Q’land ? —B3.
(1) In 1884. (2) The captain and mate were
tried for murder and sentenced to death. The
sentence was commuted to penal servitude for
life. Five others were sentenced to terms of
penal servitude. (3) In 1885 a Royal Commis-
sion inquired into the conduct of six vessels,
one being the Hopeful. The Commission re-
ported concerning this vessel, “We are of the
opinion that none of the recruits on board the
Hopeful were lawfully requited, and that not
one understood he had to remain and serve
in Queensland for three years.” It reported
further that the history of the Hopeful was
“one long record of deceit, cruel treachery,
deliberate kidnapping and cold-blooded mur-
ders.”
What memorials have been erected in Aus-
tralia in recognition of Capt. Cook’s dis-
coveries ? —235.
In Hyde Park, Sydney, there is a statue by
Woolner, unveiled on Feb. 25, 1879; and the
landing-nlace at Kurnell on Botany Bay is
marked‘by a tablet and a monument, near
which the event is annually commemorated.
Tablets are also placed on Cape Everard, near
the hill first sighted from the Endeavour; on
Mount Warning, the “remarkable high peak”
noted in Cook’s log on May 16, 1770; and on
Possession Island in Torres Strait, where he
formally annexed the eastern coast to Britain.

the same area as a mile square, 640 acres;
the distinction is that any area of 640 acres,

FROM CHINA TO PERU.
“X.S.”: The Law has long ears, but
it is seldom that it displays them so
blatantly as in a recent case in Britain.
An unemployed man was charged with
stealing ten fowls. It turned out in evi-
dence that when arrested he had only
seven birds in his possession, two of the
remaining three being subsequently found
wandering around the countryside ; and
he was acquitted on the ground that
the stealing of ten fowls had not been
proved. The police thereupon appealed
to the King’s Bench, which sent the case
back to Durham with the instruction to
convict for the theft of at least seven
head of poultry.

“Si Anu”: A curious contest has de-
veloped between the British press of
Malaya and Sir Cecil Clementi, the new
Straits Governor. He is a fanatical
adherent to the new policy of Malayan-
isation, which aims at making Malay
the common language of the country, as
it is in the Dutch dominions. The Eng-
lish papers want English to be the lingua
franca, naturally anticipating that if
Malay becomes the language of the
country a vernacular press will arise as
it has done in Java, and down will go
their circulations. Their main argument,
however, is that any attempt to force
Malayanisation on a country where the
Malay is steadily being swamped under
a flood of aliens will raise the racial
issue in an acuter form than it exists at
present. There are nearly half a million
Chinese and Indians on Singapore,
against 70,000 of the indigenes.

“Putney”: Publication of the Queen
Victoria-Gladstone letters throws some
curious light on the gap in the Poet
Laureateship after Tennyson’s death in
1895. The Queen thought somebody
should be appointed, even though nobody
could fill Tennyson’s shoes; the Prime
Minister, after tentatively suggesting
Ruskin (!), pointed out that Swinburne
was pre-eminent but “impossible.” Vic-
toria had repeatedly remonstrated with
the Liberal leader because of the dis-
respectful language used by some of
his colleagues about the House of Lords,
and one can’t help wondering if Glad-
stone’s conviction of Swinburne’s “im-
possibility” was affected by reading the
poet’s apostrophe to that august body,
published 30 years before.
Bright sons of sublime prostitution,
Ye are born of the mire of the street,
Where your grandmothers walked in pollution
Till a coronet shone at their feet.
Ye are worthy to rule o’er your brothers,
To condemn them as clods and as carles,
Who are Graces—by grace of such mothers
As brightened the bed of King Charles.
The upshot of it was that there was no
Laureate until the Liberal Government
went out and the cynical Lord Salisbury
pitchforked a political leader-writer into
the job. Yet Swinburne, in his later
years, became not only a loyalist but an
Imperialist.
* ' * * St
“Passer”: A cable from the Land of
the Blue Eagle says that “starlings,
brought from England in 1890 to combat
sparrows, have become one of Washing-
ton’s worst civic problems.” How they
were going to “combat” sparrows isn’t
explained. Certainly they don’t keep
down the smaller birds in Britain or any
other country that I ever heard of. Aus-
tralia has two distinct species of imported
starlings, and one of these, the Indian
variety, was imported to combat a pest —
the cane-beetle of Queensland. Heaven
only knows who it was that introduced
the European starling, and why he did it,
but I suspect that it was long before 1890,
for the “Australian Encyclopaedia”
gloomily records that Sturnus vulgaris “is
spread all over south-eastern Australia
from Adelaide to Rockhampton and is
steadily extending its range.” Most likely
some homesick exile was responsible,
though the starling is not viewed with
any such hostility in England as he has
provoked in these latitudes.

“Pickering Junction”: British railway
interests some time ago hit on an un-
usual advertising stunt. They sent one of
their most famous trains to the United
States, where it traversed the country on
American roadbeds. This was possible
because both countries use the standard
gauge, in strong contrast to Australia.
The train chosen was the “Flying Scots-
man,” and it covered thousands of miles
on the by no means perfect American
and Canadian roadbeds without a single
replacement through damage or wear
being necessary, though souvenir hunters
got away with 500 electric-light globes
and thousands of sightseers scribbled
their names all over everything.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The first service held by the Anglican
Church to call a blessing on the law
term coincided with the Red Mass for
the same purpose which has been held in
St. Mary’s for several years. Justice Har-
vey was one of the strong supporters for
the initiation of the C. of E. service and
was among the bewigged and gowned
present. There were ten Judges at St.
James’s, among them Jordan, C.J., and
the sturdy four-square church was filled
to capacity. There was an equally large
attendance at the Basilica; Apostolic
Delegate Bernardini, himself a Doctor of
Civil Law, said the Mass.
Later the Banco Court was dressed in
scarlet and ermine. The Chief Justice,
who took his seat on the Bench
for the first time, looked dignified and
impressive in the robes bequeathed by
Frederick Darley to his successors. There
were ladies present, most of them wed to
the Law, but their clothes were dull and
pallid things compared with the dazzling
robes of office. Attorney-General Man-
ning ran off sonorous sentences of wel-
come —a nicely-balanced bit of phrasing
in which three- and four-syllable words
beat out a grave rhythm.
If you want to know how to throw a
successful tea-party in a hurry ask Mary
Brodie of the Australian Inland Mission.
A week or two ago up in Cloncurry
Allan Vickers, the popular flying doctor
of the A.1.M., married his Lilias Whit-
man, the pretty, slim, dark daughter of
the local chemist. The two came down
to Sydney, were coo-eed into the
assembly-rooms on the afternoon before
they sailed on a Chinese honeymoon, and
to meet them Miss Brodie had a group
of reverends, and the press.
It was a gay little do, up in the council-
room, with Miss Congreve as hostess, and
two of the most interested among the
guests were Mrs. Rossell and her Dr.,
who takes up the winged practice so suc-
cessfully run for three years by his pre-
decessor. Before joining the A.I.M. Dr.
Vickers practised in Albury. Dr. Ros-
sell has been for some years in Orange.
When Dr. Vickers and his bride return
they hope to settle at Port Hed-
land (W.A.) and be another link in
the medical service in the nor’-west of
Westralia. Slight, fair and handsome is
how the ladies describe Allan. His yearly
average of patients has been 250 ; he has
flown about 80,000 miles in all and has
given advice over innumerable A.I.M.
wireless-sets.
We haven’t had the De Veres yet, nor
the Montmorencys, but last week we had
a second visitation from the Percys. The
Duke of Northumberland with his
Duchess mother and his two sisters, Lady
Diana and Lady Elizabeth Percy, arrived
for the second time in Sydney Harbor.
They came by the Lurline in company
with 407 cheery American world tourists.
Our furry things, little brother ’possum
and koala, appealed to the visitors, and
they bought up ’possum in rugs and
went off to see the native bears in their
special park. Our black opals and
sapphires caught their attention, so did
some of our hand-wrought jewellery,
but after the first day the scenery on the
way to Bulli and the beauty of our
beaches were their chief subjects of con-
versation. The big white ship, almost
as long as a street, swung at Circular
Quay, and some of the luxury suites cost
up to £3OOO. Women outnumber the
men about three to one, and there’s quite
a bunch of widows.
Last week between eighty and ninety
of the ex-pupils of Rose Bay assembled at
their old convent for their yearly meeting.
In particular, they discussed the amount
they could raise towards the Cardinal
Cerretti memorial chapel in St. Patrick’s
College, Manly. Old schoolday memories
were further revived when the little
company went into the chapel and sang
the two special school hymns. The
Apostolic Delegate, after greeting each
one gave an intimate little address
on the “old children” of the Sacred Heart
convents throughout the world—even in
Japan. In the Church “Who’s Who” Dr.
Bernardini is a great gun, and his two
brothers are cardinals. Tea in the
pleasant convent gardens rounded off the
afternoon.
Harry Hopman’s engagement to Nell
Hall is the chat on all the tennis courts.
Harry as a tennis-player needs no intro-
duction. Miss Hall has been playing a
notable game since her schooldays at
Claremont College ; and it was during
that just-past period that the two first
met on the Rushcutter Bay ground. She
has recently represented N.S.W. in Enzed.
Together the two have won the mixed
doubles championship of Australia. Wed-
ding bells will probably chime when
Harry returns with the Davis Cup team,
which he accompanies on general prin-
ciples, but particularly as newspaper cor-
respondent. The ring shows a very hand-
some display in diamonds, and should
look well when its wearer, a talented
pianist, gets into action on a keyboard.
Dean Talbot and his attractive wife
have a busy time ahead, for on the thir-
teenth of next month the new Anglican
Archbishop will be enthroned in St.
Andrew’s. There are also to be a welcome
lunch in the Blaxland Galleries and a
Town Hall party, given by the members
of his new diocese in the evening. All
of which will require a mixture of
churchly and social guiding by the good-
looking pair.
If you are a music enthusiast and
attended the Brahms and Wagnerian fes-
tivals at the Con., you’ll know this girl
with the warm smile. She is Marie
Brown, still another Australian with a
voice of grand-opera dimensions. The
songstress, who goes off to Europe next
year to specialise in lieder, is raising the
voice at the Conservatorium next month
in a programme that is rich with Handel,
Bach and Brahms. Marie in private life
is Mrs. Harold Bott.
From an Australian freshman at Cam-
bridge comes a neat little pencil sketch
of Sydney’s Archbishop-elect:
Yesterday, Sunday, I attended Holy Trinity
Church at night. The service was conducted by
Bishop Mowll, who also delivered the address.
I had previously heard him at the Kings
School, in 1931, and then was greatly im-
pressed by his speakirig and his kind nature.
I had a chance of meeting him after the ser-
vice and extending good wishes on behalf ot
TK S whose governor he is now, due to his
appointment to the position of Archbishop or
Sydney. He was most friendly and kind, and reci-
procated my good wishes to the other members
of King’s now at Cambridge but not at the
service. I hear he made himself at home in
some lads’ rooms and shared fruit andmilk
with them, so you will see there is no tommy-
rot about him as regards pomp and ceremony.
Frank Otter’s widow, back in Sydney
on her way to Maoriland to visit rela-
tions, was notable among the dancers
at the Australia last Thursday. Her tall
figure was sheathed in black lace to the
knees, whence it effulged in frills of black
tulle. White orchids dripped from her
shoulder, and her gold hair was worn
smoothed back by a diamente band
after the style of Alice in Wonderland.
“The Gay Dogs” is the title of Sydney’s
big effort in the cause of the drab alley
cat, the downtrodden pup and the tired
old horse. Of course, it’s a revue, and
all the girls and boys who can dance,
croon, torch-sing or even do a Highland
fling are getting their make-up boxes
ready for quick action back-stage in the
Savoy on March 8 and 9. Old master-
pieces will be reproduced in tableaux by
a group of modern misses posing as por-
traits of famous beauties with their pets.
One particularly beautiful reproduction
will be Diana of the Uplands. The sub-
ject of this picture, contralto Alice
Prowse (Mrs. Jimmy Brash), the Prezio-
silla of the A.B.C.’s production of “La
Forza Del Destino,” who is joint secre-
tary with Thelma Houston for the ex-
citement, is arranging a glamorous Rus-
sian scene with tenor Charles Nicis and
harpist Elizabeth Rathonyi. The bicycling
girl of the Gay ’Nineties will whizz
across the stage, and altogether the affair
promises to gather in enough money to
provide bones for every barker, milk for
every miaower and hay for every horse
which depression has sent more or less
upon the dole. Photograph from Sidney
Riley.
Sydney Uni.’s popular registrar, W. A.
Selle, chose Saturday for his wedding day.
Elvie Jean Spier, who has been on the
University staff for some years, and has
for some time past been Mr. Selle’s secre-
tary, was his bride. St. Philip’s, on
Church Hill, smiled on the blue and gold
harmony of this academic wedding, in
which both leading lady and sister Ruby,
who ’maided, combined the University
colors in frocks and flowers. Wedding
meats at the Wentworth, where all the
guests were of high degree.
On a recent broiling afternoon the
Kretschman Music Club foregathered at
the Pickwick Club with president Esther
Kahn at the piano, while Dorothy Hop-
kins’s handsome head bent over her be-
loved violin as she drew long sighing
sounds from its strings in Esther’s com-
position “The Twilight Hour.” Muriel
Scot warbled French love songs; Kitty
Glover, in a frock of apple-green silk,
uplifted a luscious voice in romantic
lieder; Montgomery Stuart added a
humorous dialogue, and Mrs. “Mont-
gomery” took her turn with velvet touch
at the piano. The whole, which had a
well-groomed audience, was garnished
with great vases of roses and attended
with tea and ’ceteras.
Mrs. William Macleod, once “Akenehi”
of this Page, and widow of the man
whom The Bulletin staff knew affec-
tionately for many years as The Chief,
is lying very ill at Dunvegan, her Mosman
home.
Off to London by way of America
goes Lord Beauchamp with the Hon.
Hugh Lygon. The Earl and his son will
travel by the Monterey as far as New
York, and are taking a jaunt to Holly-
wood to see the stars in action. Hugh’s
two dogs, part foxie, part kelpie, a present
from Hugh D. Mclntosh, go direct to
England in the Port Hardy. What Emily
and Bluey will think of the life on the
rolling deep will probably be confided to
Arline Waddy, of the Overseas League,
and Dr. Keith Barry, to whom they have
been introduced —Dr. Barry, incidentally,
is ship’s surgeon.
The ultra-smart girl’s suits this autumn
will look as though they need shaving,
for they will be made of Angora and other
hairy and rough-looking weaves. Top-
coats have a military look and Guardsman
collars, but shoulders, though still erect,
are not so aggressive. Fur coats show
wider imagination; these are cut with
swagger backs and sometimes bound
and faced with leather in the most sport-
ing manner. A desirable musquash in a
recent show had its revers, pockets and
yoke bound with buff leather, and had a
wide belt of the same. A coat of baby
seal hung stiff and shiny as an oilskin.
It had a high double collar and a
swing-back. You won’t be out of the
fashion, either, in dyed ermine, collared
in Arctic fox, mink or the cuddly but less
expensive squirrel. ,
Hats are more coy than ever, and we re
all going to look as though we’ve copied
the fairy in the bottom of our garden
with our elfin crowns. The really low-
cut shoes —in which very few feet show
at their best, and a really high instep
looks calamitous —are flung behind us
with other last-winter garments of re-
pentance. The tunic is once more with
us, with the coat-frock of every womans
affection, though this year’s version is
more artful in line than its post-war
sister. The woollen tree-bark surfaces
are disappointing if you really expect to
find the graining of a tree-trunk, but a
red-brown silk velvet seen at an early
autumn show, patterned with a wavy
design in a lighter tone, came almost as
close to the arboreal skin as Nature her-
self. ,
Mrs. John Collins was among the
much-photographed home-comers last
week. Before her marriage last Septem-
ber she was Margaret Hagon, her father
being then wearer of the mayoral
rabbit-skin. Margaret’s slim fairness was
much admired in England. The returned
pair will make their home at Beaudesert
(Q.). They left Sydney on Thursday
morning in their new aeroplane and
arrived home in time for lunch.
The Navy has a nice new dancing part-
ner the right age for Sydney buds. He
is Lieutenant W. B. Marks, who returned
with his mother, Mrs. Walter Marks, the
other day on the Otranto. He is fresh
from Greenwich and Portsmouth and the
Mediterranean Fleet, and is to join
H.M.A.S. Australia. Sister Joan remains
in England indefinitely.
Sydney is the poorer by the passing of
witty and kind-hearted Mrs. John Eales,
who had a zest for life that kept her as
young in heart and mind as the newest
junior on the many charity auxiliaries
on which she worked. The Pioneer
Club, the Arts Club and the Gilbert and
Sullivan Society are mourning a popular
member. Mrs. Eales was a- daughter or
Henry Dumaresq Portus, of Newcastle.
Canon Portus and G. V. Portus, of
Sydney Uni., are brothers.

Like a beacon winking knowingly upon
this season’s social backwater, the Clive
Campbells’ dance was a promising port
of call. The looked-forward-to party
took place at Menzies on the evening
before Mrs. Campbell and daughter Pat-
ricia gummed the last label on their
trunks. Gladioli splashed their red-and-
orange spikes, and bamboos waved
featherdusters against the sombre pillars.
Mrs. Campbell handled alluring orchids
against a sweep of black lace. Pat tied a
youthful sash round a pink-and-blue
simplicity-frock which will accompany
her to school in Switzerland. The Sey-
mour Dennis, O’Dell Crowther and Irv-
ing Davidson couples were among the
entertained, also several Wettenhalls,
Nancy Grant, Judy and Peggy Burston,
Peter and Pat Bell, Dr. Lempriere and
Mervyn Sprague.
The A. M. Nicholas mansion at Sher-
brooke is completed. For miles across the
rolling valley it can be seen, and its high-
est turrets overlook most peaks and coun-
try cottages in the district. What isn’t con-
crete in the flat-roofed design is of glass.
Walls have been dispensed with in favor
of immense glass windows. Window-
cleaners are pleased, but not so artists,
for there’s nowhere to hang the smallest
canvas. Native-bears and kookaburras
frolic around the “fortress.” An elaborate
heating system includes steam-pipes run-
ning snugly under window-seats. The
oatmeal-and-green kitchen supplies air-
proof receptacles for all groceries, cup-
boards as methodically thought out as a
filing system, and electric freezers. Be-
low in the basement are more freezers,
large enough to hold a couple of bullocks
at a time, and a drying room. And there
are a lift, a sunroom in the tower and a
pink, blue, yellow or green bathroom ad-
jacent to each bedroom. The swimming
pool, large enough to please a talkie star,
will be heated in winter, and there’s a
squash-rackets court. A. M. Nicholas has
a town house, a seaside residence and
now this mountain “week-ender.”
Wearing the black velvet tarn is Mrs.
J. D. Brown, who is off to Spain early
in March. Under her maiden name of
Nina Murdoch she wrote “Seventh
Heaven,” “Miss Emily in Black Lace”
and “Portrait of Miss Emily,” successes
inspired by her travels in Italy and
France. Verse from her pen has appeared
in The Bulletin, and she undertook
the Children’s Corner for 3LO and
revolutionised the session. Her charm
lies in being always natural. She founded
the Argonauts’ Club, in which 2000
hearty youngsters promise per radio to
be good Argonauts, by looking for adven-
ture and always pulling a brave oar.
J. D. Brown has been transferred to
Adelaide as assistant editor of the
“Evening News.”
It was a great display that the Navy,
Army and Air Force gave last week at
the Exhibition. Guns and waggons gal-
loped round the arena, were pushed over
walls and through holes, taken to pieces,
put together and fired with noise and
smoke, much to the delight of small boys.
Light Horse exhibitions of trick riding
somewhat shook the lads’ intentions of
becoming artillerymen, and, after they’d
seen a bombing attack by “Bulldog”
’planes, nothing but the Air Force was
sufficiently thrilling. The Vic. Scottish
Regiment piped proudly in its brand-new
kilties. Rain fell at the tail-end of one
night with sufficient force to soak the
stoical massed bands and the silver hair
of Lieut.-Governor Irvine when he
removed his belltopper for the Anthem.
Brown-eyed Mrs. W. Mortill is the sub-
ject of this Broothorn portrait. She’s
Russian by birth and parentage and was
educated in Moscow, where she studied
arts and crafts. Her knowledge of
Byzantine art and ritual has given her a
new and absorbing occupation for the
last 18 months, during which period she
painted three ikons and several banners
as a gift for the newly established Syrian-
Russian Church. Mrs. Mortill is musical
and a fluent linguist. She and her Aus-
tralian husband seldom miss a race meet-
ing and entertain a good deal at Tay
Creggan.
In Melbourne Grammar School chapel
Elizabeth Saenger and Mark Graham
slipped quietly into matrimony. Some-
different in wedding attire was the
bride s choice in her shimmery white
moire. Its decolletage was camouflaged
with a circular coatee, and its sleeveless
version left a loophole for adjustable
cuffs from wrist to elbow. The little hat
was primped with a starched eye-veil
Rejoicings were at Menzies. After the
’moon the couple start housekeeping at
Port Fairy.
Scots Church opened its portals to
receive Betty Whitford and W. J. Brown-
ing, who exchanged vows and experi-
enced a shower of confetti on a recent
evening. The gown of hand-made lace,
in the front a sheath-like simplicity with
its high neck and tight sleeves, burst into
a following wake of train over which
bubbled a triple-tiered tulle veil. Nora
Whitford and Jeanette Cullen, their heads
haloed with plaited silver ribbon per-
formed their ’maids’ duties with “dusty”
pink chiffon and bunches of zinnias.
Guests, among whom were many countrv
people, gathered at the Windsor.
Mary Sharp has announced her engage-
ment to Ragnar Lundquist. He’s Swedish,
die family stronghold being Gothenburg
The marriage will take place in Cairo.
Phyllis Jacobs a niece of Lady Isaacs,
and John Capie Thomson have fixed the
date of their marriage for March
Festivities will happen at the Hawthorn
Consul for Norway and
Mrs. Sverre Lie, who is Miss Jacobs’s
sister. The house will zoom with activity •
the Lie couple will have only a few
hours between locking their suitcases as
the incoming mailboat drops her anchors
and opening them to shake out their
wedding finery.
A thrill for Vic. girl polo players is
the decision to accept the S.A. Polo
Association’s invitation to send a
women’s team across the border for the
March Polo Week. It’s a rapid stride,
for the inter-State match will take place
only five weeks after the first women’s
teams’ match in Vic.
Perth doings:
Wee Billy Lathlain’s page suit of white satin
with snowy lace ruffles vanguarded the bridal
procession in the Male-Lathlain nuptials at
St. George’s. Knight William’s arm held the
long, light-fitting sleeve adhering to daughter
Joy’s curd-white satins, which flowed melliflu-
ously as to train. Tiny leaves and flowerlets
attached the swirl of tulle to a head bowed over
milky tuberoses. Gold tissue halos, wrought
with bows, heralded the approach of Gwyneth
Ambrose and Freda Weir, whose shields of
l , ves > blazoned with azalias, screened
slit-back gold faille buckled at the neck nape
with amber. Walls of the Y.A.L. Hall echoed
to the cheers.
Ihe s.s. Perth chugged down the river bear-
ing a cargo of delegates attending the rural
science course at the Uni. The pick was
dropped at Point Walter, where Mrs. T. C
Wilson brewed a pot of tea in the open-air
tearooms after the races and competitions
Minister for Agriculture H. Millington
addressed the students, and on their behalf
made a presentation to Mrs. Mary Farrelly.
Sufficient rain to lay the dust around St.
Marys, South Perth, cleared the atmosphere
Joan Drummond’s double-harness yoking
with Harry Calder. The petals of a delicate
pink rose caressed the brim of a transparent
parchment headpiece which surmounted the
pleated shoulder battlements of the clinging
oatmeal mousseline. Mrs. St. Aubyn Barrett-
Lennard and Margaret Drummond swung gof-
fered cape sleeves as they swished down the
zinma-and-fern-embellished aisle in their blush-
pink flat crepes.
Mrs. Cecil Mason rallied L.A.B. Club mem-
bers to imbibe a farewell cup of tea with their
press correspondent, Mrs. W. R. Campbell, who
leaves with daughter Bernice for a year’s tour
around the capitals of the eastern States. The
Shakspeare Circle of the Repertory Club fol-
lowed suit with an an revoir gathering in its
lounge, where sunny clusters of golden glow
sprouted from the tables. Presentation rose-
buds were held in front of flag-striped linen
suiting.
Ena Cockram made a day of entertaining
at the Palace from morning-tea to five-o’clock
cocktails, with a floating personnel of guests
and a slither from navy-and-white crepes to
green floral flimsies. The lass’s end-
of-the-month marriage to Ken Cameron was
by a hen convention, with Gwen
Hall s trim saxe-blue suit behind the teapot.
Before leaving for Sydney Mrs. A. H. Boyes,
in slinky atmosphere-blistered crepe, made final
adieus over cocktails, shaken in the dahlia-
strewn Palace lounge. Hostess chairs were occu-
pied by Mrs. Bill Broadhiirst’s blue-and-mus-
tard checks, and Mrs. Ron Oldhani’s brown-
flecked white linen.
Lawyer Ned Moss won his brief in the court
of Joy Hill, the Manners Hills’ pretty brunette
daughter. Witnesses are to be subpoenaed in
the near future.
Women’s Service Guild members welcomed
Mrs. B. M. Rischbieth back to the fold with
a galaxy of phlox and carnations in the recep-
tion-room, and a tea-and-music accompaniment
to the speeches. Mrs. Browning-Turner pre-
sided, and Mrs. Orgill arranged the doings.
Enid Russell, Perth’s pioneer woman lawyer,
is removing her barrister’s wig for a year to
let the winds of England blow through her
locks.
Adelaide’s social activities:
Cocktail parties are still going strong, society
being in a chronic state of wishing the depart-
ing bon voyage or extending a welcome to
those returning. Mesdames Lance Lewis and
R. L. Davidson combined both pleasing gestures
at Benacre when they entertained at the home
of Mrs. Lewis, at which Mrs. Roy Burston
one of the returned voyagers, was very smart
in r . marocain figured in beige, worn with
a beige straw hat. That popular young couple,
the Ronald Orrs, departed in the Maloia after
a whirl of gaiety. Mrs. Orr’s mother, Mrs
Frank Forwood, gave a morning-tea at the
Queen Adelaide Club the day before they
sailed, when she entertained about 70 of their
friends. The same afternoon Betty Morgan
and Helen Bruce gave them a cocktail party
at the home of Dr. and Mrs. A. M. Morgan,
North Adelaide. The guests were received in
the drawing-room, and passed out into the
garden, where refreshments were served. Miss
Bruce wore a beige pebble crepe, and Miss
Morgan blue-and-white flowered silk.
The return of Kathleen McMichael and Marv
Lisle Johnson, who with Mr. and Mrs Frir
McMichael, of Mount Lofty, have been'on a
tour of England and the Continent, has been
the occasion for several parties. Josephine Daw-
son gave a bridge evening at her home, Hyde
Park, and Pattie Verco, at her Mount Lofty
home, entertained about 50 friends in« their
honor. The young hostess was frocked in white
patterned georgette, Miss Johnson wore brown
marocain, and Miss McMichael powder-blue
flowered crepe de Chine. Hydrangeas and
gladioli decked the drawing-room.
The approaching marriage of Colleen Cud-
more, daughter of Mrs. Roland Cudmore, to
Geoffrey, son of Justice Angas Parsons and
his wife, has started pre-wedding parties. Olga
Krakowsky, first in the field, gave a linen tea
for the bride-elect at the home of Madame
Krakowsky, Glenelg.
The young horsewomen in Adelaide are tak-
ing up polo seriously, and practise regularly
every Wednesday and Saturday at Birkalla.
Many children, too, are becoming proficient,
especially the little daughters of the Teesdale-
Smiths, whose parents have always been very
keen. A women’s polo team is coming over
from Melbourne next month to play the S.A.
team, which is to include Mrs. E. Paterson
and Misses L. Sandison, E. Lillecrapp and G.
Bakewell.
Dominick and Una Daly are spending a fort-
night in Adelaide en route for England. They
are grand-nephew and grand-niece of Sir
Dominick Daly, who was Governor of this
State in 1862.
Dr. and Mrs. Roy Burston are a much-feted
couple. Those who have given parties in their
honor include Mrs. W. Culross, at the Queen
Adelaide Club, Mrs. Stanley Skipper, who enter-
tained at her home, North Adelaide, and Mes-
dames Humphrey Makin and Harry Nott, who
were joint hostesses.
Mrs. Wordsworth James gave an afternoon
party at the Wentworth tearooms. Bridge was
the main attraction. The hostess was gowned
in dark-green chiffon velvet and a hat to
match.
The Speck goes racing:
Race Week in Hobart saw the town packed
with visitors, country and mainland faces show-
ing up in hundreds each day. Cup Day was
hot and sunny, and the Elwick lawns looked
none the worse for the dry season. The v.-r
Clarks brought with them Miss McLellan and
Miss E. Stephen, and were entertained at tea
by president A. J. Miller and his wife. Lady
Clark’s frock of soft, dull-blue georgette and
needle-run lace was topped by a small, flat
hat with variously shaded flowers. Mrs. Miller
was in navy, and Mrs. Clemons (wife of the
northern president) wore blue also.
The Andrew Raeburns came from Launces-
ton, also the A. Peppers, the Guy Merediths,
the A. F. Scotts and the Charlie Souls. On
the lawn were the Ashbolt lady. Dr. and Mrs.
H. Harris (Sydney), the F. X. de Bavays, the
Jvo Agnews, Mr. and Mrs. Tom Lyons, Mrs.
Sam Cox and Sybil Lyons, the Alan Camerons,
Mrs. Max Glover (Melb.), Col. and Mrs. Whit-
ham, Dr. and Mrs. Nigel Smith (Sydney), the
Russell Ibbotts, the Gordon Clarkes (Vic.), the
C. Wolfhagens, Mrs. T. W. H. Clarke (Quorn),
Mrs. E. H. Webster and her niece Betty Huds-
peth, one of the season’s debs., the Lester
Butlers (Melbourne), the James Murrays, Com-
mander and Mrs. Heriot, Dr. and Mrs. C. N
Atkins, Mrs. L. Agnew (N.S.W.), Mr. and Mrs.
J. Hay, Dr. and Mrs. Sweetham and Dr. and
Mrs. E. A. Rogers.
Steeplechase Day in the Launceston Race
Week provided an unrehearsed thrill for spec-
tators ; a baby cyclone took part of the roof
off the grandstand while the big race was in
progress. Fortunately the iron sheets of roof-
ing were lifted and dropped at the back of the
stand, so no one was seriously injured, but
the panic that ensued was responsible for many
minor casualties. Weather being dull and cool,
frocking was wintrified.
Great disgruntlement was felt at the absence
of a warship to act as flagship at the regatta
this year, but the Navy was practising gun-
firing and other stunts. The schooner Alma
Doepel, all dressed up for the occasion, was
a good substitute. His Ex. watched the races,
and the Domain was packed with a happy
holiday crowd and an endless variety of shows.
Regatta Day was rounded off by the Aquatic
Ball, engineered by four yachting clubs, and
held in the City Hall. The main hall was
fixed up like a ship’s deck, with the dais as
the bridge. Crossed oars and flags, lifebuoys
and model yachts were set about, and supper
tables were bright with red and pink dahlias.
Teacups and tongues clattered at the Queen
Mary Club when the president and committee
housewarmed additions to the premises. Mrs.
W. Wolfhagen, president (in navy blue), and
the committee received the guests.
The gladioli show at the City Hall made it
hard to believe in the dryness of the season.
His Ex. opened the show. C. E. Radcliffe
added to his record by winning the challenge
cup for the best seedling. The non-competitive
display of mixed flowers and fruit was a joy
to the eye.
Senator Pearce and his lady were guests of
honor at a shivoo given by the A.W.N.L. at
the league’s rooms. Mrs. Mary Parker, State
president, welcomed the Pearces, and the De-
fence Minister gave a short address.
Gertrude and Violet Whyte-Parsons (Laun-
ceston) are flitting to the Cold Country for an
extended- trip. Mrs. Hogg, Annesbrae, fare-
welled them with a bridge party. Niece Wini-
fred, from M.L., joins the Misses Whyte-Par-
sons later, sailing from Sydney at the end of
this month.

THE PALETTE
“This gayest, this loveliest, this hap-
piest, this most inspiring of modern ex-
hibitions” were the words in which
an enthusiastic admirer opened a show
of Helen Stewart’s pictures at Sydney’s
Macquarie Galleries. When The Bulle-
tin wandered in the only nice-looking
things about the place were a couple of
bowls of real zinnias framed in a real
window and illumined by real sunlight,
and a most beautifully moulded bronze
statuette (not by Miss Stewart) which
sat on a table and looked at the walls
with fierce defiance, conscious of the
rectitude of its curves. Miss Stewart
(this'is gleaned from the speech of the
enthusiastic admirer, a transcript of
whose remarks lies on another table for
sceptics to read) studied under Parisian
masters and gained her “fine sense of
draughtmanship” from Thea Proctor.
That Miss Stewart can draw is proved
by some pencil studies from the nude,
accurate, but lacking grace. That she
has a sense of color and design is proved
by every one of her canvases. Why she
conceives the art of portraiture and the
depiction of street scenes as a game in
which one envisages things seen as a
collocation of little slabs of kalsomine-
tinted cardboard (the fewer the better)
is a matter for her Parisian masters to
explain. Exponents of other arts are
seeking to increase their range of expres-
sion. Literature, music and the drama
seize eagerly upon each pew opportunity
to enlarge their scope. Why drive paint-
ing back to the dark cavern from which
it emerged?
“F.S.”: I hear that an exhibition of
pictures by “Painters Courageous is
to be held at Melbourne in aid of one of
the innumerable hospital funds. Already,
it is reported, eminent personages, who
have never held a brush in their hands,
unless it has been a clothes brush, are
engaged in putting their impressions on
canvas. Many of these people are “pat-
rons” of art and artists, and talk plati-
tudinously in public on the importance
of art and so forth. It doesn’t seem to
have occurred to them that their enter-
prise seems as silly to serious painters
as if they stood on their heads and
attempted to play a Bach chaconne on a
fiddle with their toes at a symphony con-
cert. The only excuse that can be made
for them is that modernist theories about
painting lead logically to the conclusion
that the works of infants, imbeciles and
ignoramuses are of equal significance
with those of competent painters —so
why not the works of society ladies?
“F.S.”: The prominent note of the
anti-war exhibition of paintings, draw-
ings and posters at the Queen’s Hall,
Melbourne, was belligerency. When
present critic entered, an enthusiast for
no-more-war, with his eyes flaming, his
coat-tails flying in the breeze and his
clenched fists semaphoring round his
head, was verbally knocking the stuffing
out of a meek individual who looked
like a congenital pacifist. What the meek
individual .had said to stir the anti-war
advocate’s ire the writer doesn’t know —
perhaps he had passed some mild com-
mentary on the quality of the art dis-
played—but it is pretty certain that the
next time he ventures into the company
of the Davids of peace he will obtain the
protection of the police. The anti-war
pictures are as warlike as their admirers.
Capitalists are being bashed on the head
and archbishops pursued by their indig-
nant flocks. The horrors of war are
painted with a lavish hand. Soldiers’
heads are being blown off and the brains
of children spattered on the ground. The
most effective polemics against war are
the satirical cartoons in which the god-
dess of peace, with a gas-mask on her
head, is being worshipped by disarma-
ment conferences, etc. W. M. Hughes
comes in for some vituperative shafts.
The only criticism that can be directed
at the show is that it leaves a spectator
who shares the anti-war council s dis-
gust of war where he was as far as know-
ing how to remove the causes of inter-
national conflict is concerned.
“Meldrumite”: Melbourne’s anti-war
exhibition raises the question as to
whether propaganda can be art. The
propagandist is a person who preaches,
and some people hold that an artist
should never preach. But when an artist
paints a picture there is no question that
he is saying something about something,
and it must be either a lie or a truth.
In either case, it is obviously propaganda.
The question is, about what? The anti-
war cartoonists are propagandists for
peace. They are concerned with certain
political ideas which they think can be
better put in pictorial symbols than in
words. People who agree with their ideas
recognise the symbols, and the cruder
they are the more easily they are recog-
nised ; and there is immediate applause.
On the other hand, people who don’t like
their ideas react violently the other way.
Simultaneously with the anti-war exhibi-
tion there was a show at the Meldrum
Gallery by Messrs. Meldrum, Farmer,
Jorgensen, Colahan and others, and it
was just as much propaganda as the
first. It was the propaganda of painters
concerned with preaching the beauty of
natural color, tone and form. The most
effective way to preach that particular
propaganda is by telling the utmost
degree of truth about it of which the
artist is capable.
“The Old TJn”: Before I also pass into
the Valhalla where we paint with brushes
of comets’ tails on the vault of the
Universe (for my idioms see Kipling),
may I say a word about the painting of
things as they are? In painting, as in
music, there are two schools ; but both
styles can sketch. In the romantic style you
build on the idea that you stubbed your
toe on a brick, or that your wife eloped
with the man who does the garden, a
graceful edifice which, either in crotchets
or paint, gives the listener a sensation of
faint melancholy. If you call a spade a
spade in your aesthetic language you com-
pose a march which stops about two bars
before the end of the main phrase, and
is ended by a cadenza calculated to knock
the stoutest of pianos out of tune, or you
paint a wheelbarrow with such devilish
malignity that anyone to whom you have
explained your purpose will realise that
you felt very strongly that you had
reason to hate wheelbarrows. You can
play the romantic piece or hang it on
your wall and everybody will say it is
very pretty ; somebody, even, may love
it, and may derive soul-balm therefrom.
The “realistic” piece is almost sure to be
misunderstood if the author isn’t there
to explain it. When the realists say that
they paint things as they are (or portray
definite ideas in music) it has to be ex-
plained that they don’t copy outlines
as they are —that would be photographic.
They don’t paint colors in a recognisable
fashion —that would be academic. As
musicians they don’t endeavor to imitate
the sounds associated with their idea
that would be programmatic, not to say
onomatopoeic. So it comes down to
this, that both schools endeavor to limn
the soul—the one gracefully but in-
sincerely \ the other uncouthly but, from
an individual’s angle, truthfully. Is there
no happy mean between the two ex-
tremes? The Meldrumites say they strike
it, but what’s the use? A pretty lie is
always a work of art. A statement of
truth is only artistic when the artist por-
trays perfection, and he can’t do that it
he is afraid of details and distrustful o
his - own eyesight in the matter of colors.

“Cauboy”: I would be glad to be en-
lightened as to the extent a virtuoso can
be regarded as an artist. Pouishnoff, the
Russian pianist, who puts in an appear-
ance at Melbourne in March, is said to
have a repertoire of 700 pieces, in which
he is note-perfect. Recently in London
he gave six recitals in a week, during
which he played practically the whole of
Chopin’s solo works. It seems to me that
such a colossal display of the faculty of
memorising is characteristic not of the
creative artist, who usually has a poor
memory, but of the university professor,
who spends his life dully compiling me s
and pigeonholing them carefully into
categories previously provided for mem.
He generally ends by knowing less abou
life than an intelligent small boy, who,
merely by using his powers of observa-
tion, can relate, say, the protective cus-
toms of a bird to the predatory instincts
of an animal. I have met a number of
virtuosi in my time, and they have mostly
been dull fellows who, although they
make their livings “interpreting the
sublime thoughts of Bach and Beethoven,
spend their leisure going to the ponies,
collecting stamps or reading stock-mar-
ket reports of foreign railway shares.
George English, Melbourne’s most
industrious composer after Fritz Hart,
is engaged on his third symphony,
which is to be a centenary symphony.
The opening movement will be a pov-
torale to express the arrival of the
pioneers in an agricultural paradise (with
no reference to the dispute between
Fawkner and Batman as to which was
the rightful owner); the second will be
a scherzo representing the excitement o
the gold rush, with a possible comment
on the rise in real-estate values in Col-
lins-street; the third will be a slow re-
quiem to those who fell in the Great War,
and the final movement will open to the
clash of steel hammers and the roar o
city traffic and close with a hymn o
thanksgiving, presumably in anticipation
of a reduction in the income tax. Eng-
lish can write really charming music, con-
sidered as music, but he runs a gra\e
risk, if he imports literary ideas into his
opus, of being misinterpreted by mali-
cious satirists.

BY BERNARD CRONIN.
MARY PAINTER, mechanically
stitching at a garment by the light
of an oil-lamp set on the packing-
case dresser at the side of the open kit-
chen window, heard her husband’s
stumbling footsteps as he approached the
house, and a mingled look of apprehen-
sion and defiance came on her thin,
peaked face.
She was in her early thirties, but she
looked much older. Little was left to her
of the flowerlike prettiness which she
had brought, as a bride, to George
Painter’s block in the New Mallee a
scant five years before. Her hair had
lost its sheen of corn-ripe gold and
straggled untidily; her eyes were as full
and wide as ever, but their liquid depths
were clouded. The corners of her mouth
drooped. Her shoulders slumped. Beads
of perspiration clustered on her brow
and cheek.
George Painter was approaching forty.
He was tall and thin, with sun-scarred
face and puckered blue eyes. A dusty
brown moustache drooped from his long
upper lip. He moved jerkily, as though
strung on wires. Sullenness enveloped
him like a cloud. His hands were never
still. They seemed eternally protesting
against the injustice of things as he saw
them.
He came into the room softly, even
furtively. A treacle-tin of tepid water
stood on the table, and he drank from it
thirstily. His wife, after a quick glance
at him, kept her eyes on her work. She
did not raise them again until he spoke
abruptly.
“Where’s Jackson?”
“I don’t know. Outside somewhere, I
suppose. Why ask me?”
“Well, I am asking you.”
“I’ve told you I don’t know.”
Painter wiped his lips with the back
of his hand.
“By God, you do.”
“Don’t shout at me like that, please,”
Mary Painter said. “You don’t want Jim
to hear you, I suppose.”
“I don’t care a damn whether he hears
me or not,” Painter said. “I’ve had
about enough of this, so now you know.
I’m through with him. He can clear out
in the morning. But you’re staying.”
A thin stain of color showed in Mary
Painter’s cheeks.
“I don’t know what you’re talking
about.”
Painter sneered.
“Oh yes, you do. I suppose you think
I’m blind. I’ve seen him making up to
you when my back was turned”....
“You’re crazy. George, for God’s
sake, think what you’re saying. You’ve
let the drought and the heat get into
y0u.... How dare you say such a
thing?”
“It’s time I spoke,” Painter said. He
laughed stridently. “I watched you both
when you least thought it”....
“You’re crazy. There’s never been a
look or a word out of place. Pull your-
self together before you make a fool
of yourself”....
“Stop that! Jackson can get to hell
out of here. I’ll find him and tell him
so. And you leave him be, d’ye hear? ....
None of your tricks, laying it on about
this and that and the other thing. You’re
my wife, not his. I’ll not have him hang-
ing around.... hanging around....
Where’s he got to?”
“If that’s the way you talk —find out.”
Painter cursed her.
Mary Painter’s pent-up anger exploded.
“I’ll say this for Jim, anyhow—he
knows how to treat a woman. You —
what right have you to stand there and
tell me what I’ll do or what I’ll not do?
Who brought me to this place? Is it my
fault the sky don’t rain? You’ve stood
enough, have you, George Painter? Well,
so have I. I slaved and sweated for you,
and mighty little thanks I’ve had. I’ve
grown old before my time. And just
because a man speaks a civil word”....
She burst into a wild weeping.
Painter stood with twitching mouth.
He said thickly: “You mind what I’ve
said. There’s hell enough here, without
you adding to it. Not a sheep left on
the place and the ground as bare as my
hand. Rot the drought!”
She heard him go mumbling into the
hot darkness without. For a long time
she sat without moving, her thoughts
turning this way and that, like tiny scared
creatures moving from the recesses of her
mind. She was too weary to focus them
properly. Her head ached fiercely and
her throat burned. The ovenlike atmo-
sphere seemed to sap at her very vitals.
Presently she rose and went outside.
The huge dome of night sky, ablaze with
stars, rose from the rim of a perfectly
flat horizon. In all that immensity was
no sound save the hammering of the
blood in her ears and the slow pulsation
of the darkness. The blistered earth
crouched sullen and afraid, holding its
breath against the coming enormity of
the sun. Life itself seemed suspended,
emptied of everything except the will to
escape.
Mary Painter leaned her wilting body
against the still hot iron of the long-
empty water-tank. Her hands opened
and clenched alternately, as if to their
own volition, and her eyes strained
mistily towards the inexorable void of
heaven. They saw only the white-hot
stars pricking the frowning curtain of
night. Everywhere were silence and heat
and great spaces. She could have
screamed her hate of them, only that the
constricted muscles of her throat refused
her more than a rasping sigh. At her
feet a cricket chirped feebly and was
still. A moth blundered against her
cheek and she struck at it unsteadily.
And suddenly she became terrified. She
fled back into the house and fell half-
fainting into her chair. Was it for this
she had left the green South? Love and
life had used her vilely indeed. Neither
was supportable any longer, she told her-
self dully. Of what use to struggle any
longer? The brute in nature called to
the brute in man. The never-ending
fight for a mere existence stripped one
bare of every decent thing. Only self re-
mained ; a self distorted and horrible,
staring with blind eyes of enmity and
estrangement. It was there in George,
her husband. The ‘fever of it burned
her own veins. She saw it in Jackson’s
growing curtness and irritability. It held
them all in its giant’s grip, slowly but
surely thrusting them over the brink of
madness —or worse.
A sound came thinly, and she opened
her eyes. Let George take care, or he’d go
too far. Too far? Why, he’d done that
already. She felt her anger surge.
How was it possible she had ever de-
luded herself into thinking she loved
him? Five years ago? Even a few
months ago What strange black
magic dwelt in a rainless sky that every
single tenderness she had ever known
had withered into dust? Her mind, like
his, mirrored only ugliness. She saw
him only as a bitter, disillusioned
stranger, with tormented eyes. Even the
thought of him was becoming odious....
She stared at the doorway defiantly.
But it was not her husband who pre-
sently entered. Jackson’s lean good looks
confronted her as he lounged forward to
drop heavily on the box couch. He
looked exhausted. Taking out his pipe
he began to clean it slowly and methodi-
cally.
“George is looking for you,” Mary
Painter said mechanically. She picked
up her sewing. “He went out nearly
half an hour ago.”
Jackson frowned.
“Did he say what for, Mrs. Painter?”
“No,” Mary Painter said. She bit her
lip. “I —I’m glad you came in before
him. I wanted to warn you.”
“Bad mood?”
“About as bad as can be. He’s nigh
crazy, what with one thing and another.
I guess we all are. Jim”....
“Yes?”
“Jim, don’t take any notice of any-
thing he says. You know how wild
he talks when he’s put out now. Not
like he used to be. Things have got him
down.”
“I’m all right so long as I’m left alone,”
Jackson said. He put a match to his pipe
and puffed jerkily. “But I can be nasty
enough when I ain’t. I’ve got my limits.”
“I’m not excusing George. I wasn’t
asking anything—for him. Not specially.”
Jackson ran his hand through his fair
curling hair. He looked at her steadily.
Her eyes dropped and she colored
faintly.
“Y0u”.... Jackson began, but checked
himself. He, too, averted his gaze. “It’s
been hard times here, Mrs. Painter. The
drought and a 11.... You done all right
when you come here first, didn’t you?”
“Yes. Well enough. We should have
stuck to wheat, but he would have it
there was more money in grass. We spent
most of what we’d saved putting it
down”....
Jackson smiled faintly.
“The roots are still there. They ain’t
dead yet, maybe. A drop of rain would
make a hell of a lot of difference”....
He paused, sucking at his pipe. “I was
over at Hurley’s place just now. They’re
worse off than us. Hurley ain’t got no
sheep on agistment in Gippsland.”
“And who’s to pay for ours?” Mary
Painter asked, with bitterness. “Theyll
take them forfeit, that’s what they’ll do.

Most tooth troubles
start in film
YEAR AFTER YEAR film en-
dangered this poor tooth. Year after
year the neglected molar helplessly
resisted. Film formed constantly and
each new coat contained millions of
decay germs. One day the acids these
germs produced ate through
defence wall of enamel and molar s
fight was lost. A masterpiece nature
had taken years to build —a precious
tooth—was doomed to come out!
What is this film ?
What is this film that robs us of our
teeth ? A slippery, sticky coating
formed by the mucin in saliva. It stains
teeth yellow. It catches bits food
which soon decay. Yes, but that s not
all! Film contains millions of tiny germs.
Some are rod-shaped, grouped in
clusters. These are decay germs. As
they live they give off enzymes that
produce lactic acid. This lactic acid
dissolves tooth enamel just as other
acids eat holes in wood or cloth.
Other germs are linked with “trench
mouth" —still others with pyorrhea.
“ What must I do to fight film ?”
To fight film use Pepsodent instead of
ordinary tooth pastes. Why ? Because
a tooth paste is only as good as its
polishing material —not one bit better.
The new pod filing material in Pepso-
dent is one of the great discoveries of
the day. Its power to remove every
trace of film stain is revolutionary I Its
notable distinction of being twice as
soft as polishing materials in common
use has gained wide recognition. Re-
member the one safe way to fight film
is to use the special film-removing tooth
paste —Pepsodent. Use it without fail
twice every day and see your dentist
at least twice a vear.

?We can’t settle—and you know it. George
hasn’t paid your wages this month, has
he? And the store won’t carry us tor
much longer. It’s grass we need. Where’s
it coming from?”
“The roots are still there,” Jackson
said again. “They’re good and sweet
underneath, I reckon. There’d be feed
in a week if the rain came. You’d fetch
your sheep right back”....
“I’m sick of it,” Mary Painter said.
Jackson said nothing.
“It’s green and cool and —and clean,
down south,” Mary Painter said dreamily.
“I haven’t seen a shop or a street light
for three years. I’ve forgotten what it’s
like to feel smart. You’ll be mighty glad
when you leave here, Jim.”
“Who said I was leaving?”
' Mary Painter became suddenly alert.
“Listen! George has come back.
You’ll.. . .keep your own temper, Jim?
Promise me”
“I’ll try. If you say 50.... Mary.”
“Hush!”....
George Painter, entering, stared from
one to the other. His bloodshot eyes
settled on Jackson.
“So you’re back?”
“Did you want me?” Jackson said. “I
: was over at Hurley’s. Max Hurley has
been sick. I reckon I’ll take him over
one of the melons to-morrow, if Mrs.
Painter don’t mind.”
“No,” George Painter said.
“We can spare one,” Mary Painter
said.
George Painter reached for the water-
tin. He drank noisily, wiping his mouth
with the back of his hand.
“I said no, didn’t I? Curse this heat.
Why don’t you go to bed?”
“I couldn’t sleep.” She caught her
, breath. “It’ll be cooler towards morning.
Where have you been?”
“Walking about,” George Painter said.
He gave Jackson a sidelong look. “So
Max Hurley’s sick, is he? Well, he isn’t
the only one. And there’s some here’ll
be a damned sight sicker than him
before I’m finished.”
Mary Painter stood up hastily.
“I’ll make you some tea, shall I? You’d
like some, Jim?”
“Thanks,” Jackson said briefly.
He went on reading the month-old
paper he had taken from the top of the
dresser.
George Painter relapsed into a gloomy
silence. Presently he stretched himself
out on the floor by the open door, his
restless hands beating a slow tattoo on
the warped boards. The stillness was
broken only by the sound of his heavy
breathing and the listless movements of
Mary Painter as she went about her
task. He made no response when she
set a mug of the milkless tea within his
reach.
Jackson accepted his portion with a
quiet nod. He drank the scalding liquid
almost at a gulp, and returned to his
pipe and his paper. Mary Painter took
up her sewing again. From time to time
she glanced at the two men. Her own
face was tight-lipped and inscrutable. She
panted a little with the heat. Perspira-
tion matted her hair and trickled down
her cheek. She paused at intervals to
mop at it with a discolored handker-
chief. The oppression of the night seemed
to her to be getting steadily worse. The
air was lifeless.
She must have dozed; for she came
to herself with a start at the sound of
George Painter’s voice. He was sitting
now on the wooden stool just inside the
door, his head thrust forward. Involun-
tarily she looked at the tin clock on the
mantelpiece, and noted that it was long
after midnight, just as her husband
addressed Jackson again.
“Well,” he said ; “why don’t you say
something?”
Jackson, still in his seat at the table,
said quietly: “I don’t know that there’s
anything to say. Not that’ll do any of
us any good, anyhow. I asked you again
to let me take one of the melons to Max
Hurley, for they’ve got none of their own
left, and he’s as sick as they make them.
You say you won’t. I reckon you’re
the boss.”
“Why won’t you?” Mary Painter asked
suddenly. She met her husband’s lower-
ing looks without flinching. “Why won’t
you, George?”
“It don’t matter, Mrs. Painter,” Jack-
son said.
“It matters to me. They’re my melons
as much as yours. I say Jim can take one
to the Hurleys, if he wants to.”
“You keep out of this,” George Painter
said.
“What’s behind it?” she shrilled.
“What’s on your mind now? I’m sick
of your rottenness and I don’t care who
knows it. What sort of a man are you
to grudge the sick? Oh, keep your
crankiness.... I don’t want it. I’m not
afraid of you”
The sudden outburst seemed to take
him aback.
“I never said Hurley couldn’t have
the melon. I said Jackson wasn’t going
to be let take it to him.”
“Why?”
“Because he’s not working for me any
longer—that’s why.”
Jackson broke his silence sharply.
“So that’s it You’ve got a queer
way of doing things, if you ask me. Well,
suit yourself. There’s a matter of eight
quid owing me. I don’t go without that.”
“You’re not going,” Mary Painter said.
Her eyes were frightened. “George
doesn’t mean it”....
“By God, I do,” George Painter said.
His hands made little aimless, thrusting
movements. “You’ll go in the morning.
Make no mistake about that.”
“I don’t go without my money,” Jack-
son repeated.
“You’ll get it Ah, that surprises
you, doesn’t it? Every damned penny
of it”....
“All right,” Jackson said. For the
first time he looked straight at Mary
Painter. “I’m fired. You’ll tell me why,
maybe?”
“I’m not arguing about it,” George
Painter said.
Jackson’s eyes came slowly back to
his employer. The lines of his mouth
grew ugly.
“Well, I am. It’s my right to know.
Are you going to tell me?”
George Painter hesitated.
“No, I’m not.”
“Then I will,” Mary Painter said.
“Hold your tongue, Mary.”
“No,” Jackson said. “Speak right out,
Mrs. Painter.”
Mary Painter looked at her husband
derisively.
“He thinks you’re in love. with me,
Jim.”
“You little fool!” George Painter said
between his clenched teeth. “Well, have
it your own way. It makes no differ-
ence.”
Jackson began to laugh ; but there was
no mirth in his twisted mouth.
“And he thinks I’m in love with you,
Jim,” Mary Painter continued recklessly.
“And. so you’re to go, you see, before
worse comes of it.”
“That’s enough,” George Painter said.
“You go to your room.... and stop
there.”
“No, I won’t. You can’t make me.”
“You’ll do as I say.”
“Keep your hands off me,” Mary
Painter blazed.
Jackson’s laughter ceased abruptly. He
stood up.
“That’s right. I reckon you ain’t fit to
own a dog, Painter, let alone a wife.
“If you interfere,” George Painter
said, with a wicked stare, “so help me
God, it’ll be the last time you ever do.
Their looks crossed.
“I reckon,” Jackson said slowly, “that’s
for your wife to say.”
“Don’t try me too far,” George Painter
said. The veins on his forehead seemed
to swell. “You get out of my house....
Damn you, Jackson, I’ve had enough or
this. You get to hell out of here.”
“If Jim goes I go with him,” Mary
Painter said.
In the stark silence that followed none
of the three saw the sudden bellying ot
the window curtain at her back or the
flick of the flame of the lamp on the
dresser. The low rumbling vibration
that accompanied these things passed un-
noticed in the electric atmosphere of un-
leashed elemental passion.
George Painter’s sharply released
breath sounded like a rushing of steam.
“Christ!” he said.
The table went crashing to the floor as
the two men met in a welter of savage
blows. Jackson’s right fist came up in a
tremendous uppercut that sent George
Painter reeling. The blow overbalanced
him and he stumbled. Painter, recover-
ing, seemed fairly to lift his whole body
in the air. The impact hurled Jackson
to the wall. They clinched and fell.
Through the wind of their fury came the
thin sound of Mary Painter’s hysterical
screaming.
“The rain, the rain! Oh, God, the
rain! Can’t you hear it?”
A furious gust of wind shook the
house The iron on the roof drummed
madly. The night split to thunderous
echoes.
“The rain! Rain!”....
The fighting men broke apart. Dazed
and panting they got to their feet. Mary
Painter, her tears streaming, threw her
arms about her husband’s neck.
“George! You idiot! George,
the drought’s broken.”

George Painter’s battered lips grinned.
He put his arms about his wife’s waist.
He had to shout to make himself heard
through the riotous deluge.
“Think I’m deaf? Mary, listen to it.
Jim, damn it, the lamp’s blown out.
Where are you, Jim?”
“Here,” Jackson said. A flash of light-
ning revealed him framed in the door-
way. “She’s from the north-west... .a
real rip-snorter. Thank God you hung
to those sheep, George. There’ll be feed
and to spare in a week.”
“Jim.”
“Yes, Mrs. Painter.”
“Jim.... the tank spouting’s blown
loose.”
“I’ll fix that,” George Painter said. He
found his wife’s lips under cover of the
momentary darkness. They clung a
moment. “I’ll fix that. You get out to
the sheds, Jim, and cover that chaff.”
“Right-oh, boss.”
Mary Painter screamed after him:
“You’ve gone without your umbrella,
Jim Oh, Lord! it’s coming through
the roof on to the bed, George. I told
you to fix that ridging”....
She ran back to the kitchen to get a
bucket.
Dan and Uncle Are Suspected
BY STEELE RUDD.
HIGH noon found Dan and Uncle still
in the shade of “Tyson’s paddock.”
Dan was up the creek, fossicking
in the deepest holes for mussels ; Uncle
crouched motionless before the tent door
—the “tent” was a fly only—with his
felt hat on. The crown ran into a peak
like a poke bonnet; the leaf drooped
mournfully over his face.
Uncle looked like the last of the
nomads, reflecting on the passing of his
race. But his looks were deceiving. He
was not thinking of himself or of his
“race.” He had put down a week-old
number of the “Daily News,” containing
sensational details of the murder of two
girls along the river. Though police
were everywhere, the murderers were still
at large.
As he pondered, something unexpected
happened. Mary Murray, a girl of fif-
teen, barefoot, big for her age and
vigorously developed, as country girls
often are, was taking a short-cut from
the little store back on the main road to
her home. She came suddenly upon the
“tent.” Its presence there flapping in a
secluded hollow among the trees sur-
prised her. When she saw the crouched
figure of Uncle she stood and stared.
As she stared her imagination began to
spark up. Thoughts of the river tragedy
and of the murderers being still at large
took possession of her., She trembled,
but she couldn’t make up her mind to
run on or back to the store.
Uncle, quite unconscious of her, threw
up his hands to ward off the flies. His
action settled Mary. She screamed, and
fled homeward, scaling a sloping bank
with the strides of an emu. She screamed
again, and she faltered in taking two
narrow gullies in succession; then again
when she slipped.
Uncle stood up, looking as if he
doubted his senses, and stared after Mary
till she disappeared from view and out
of hearing.
“Somethin’ has given the girl a fright,”
he mumbled, turning and looking about
in search of a cause. Then, gathering up
the paper, he sat down and began reading
it again.
Dan, carrying a few moist mussels,
walked lightly as he approached the tent.
Being in a jocose mood, he imitated the
call of the wild goose for Uncle’s benefit.
Uncle thought the screaming girl had re-
turned, and gave such a jump that he fell
back off his perch and bruised himself.
Dan laughed raucously.
“There’s nothing in acting th’ fool,”
Uncle grumbled, “when a man is readin’
and not expectin’ such silly jokes!”
Dan laughed again ; but presently he
became serious.
“I didn’t act th’ fool when a darned
black snake nearly bit me twice in a
waterhole up there,” he said.
“You got to look out for black snakes
round here,” Uncle observed. “They live
in waterholes, an’ can bite you under th’
water. That’s why I never go in swim-
ming.”
“This fellow jumped through the water
at me,” Dan declared excitedly, “just
when I leaned over the edge of the bank
to put me hand in to feel for a mussel.
And when I snapped me hand back and
punched th’ cow on th’ point of his nose
he made another devil of a spring and
nearly got me by th’ nose.”
. “Th’ worst place he could have bit
you,” Uncle said sagely. “It would ’a’
had to be cut off, or th’ most of it would.”
‘And wasn’t he a whopper!” Dan ex-
claimed.
“They must be the biggest of any, the
ones about here,” Uncle went on. “No
one to kill them. So little settlement;
they’ve been left to grow to any size.
And that’s another of th’ reasons why
I never go in to swim alone.”
“You needn’t go in alone. Any time
y’ feel like it I’ll go in with you,” Dan
suggested. “Or I’ll stand on th’ bank
and keep th’ cows off you with a stick.”
Uncle lapsed into silence.
“What about it?” Dan prompted.
Instead of Uncle answering a husky
voice behind them called “Heigh!”
Dan and Uncle looked round in sur-
prise.
“I’ve got you! Stand where you are
and don’t move!”
They saw a hatless man with a gun fac-
ing them, standing off about ten yards.
With him were two youths, one about
seventeen, the other thirteen.
“He’ll be the cove —the big one with
the black whiskers” ; and the elder boy
pointed accusingly to Dan.
“Who are you pointin’ at?” Dan ques-
tioned cynically. “What are yous up to?”
“You, you scoundrel!” shouted the
man. “You chased my daughter passing
here, and wanted to catch her—you—you.
Stand your ground!”
Dan was astonished.
“Who are you?” he asked, “and what
game d’ y’ think you’re cornin’ at, old
fellow? Chased whose daughter?”
“Ah!” blustered the other, “who am I?
I’m Wilford Murray, and these are my
two sons, an’ the p’lice will tell you what
game I’m cornin’ at directly. Word has
been sent. They’re all out looking for
someone like ypu.”
Uncle, who had been listening closely
to every word, began to understand.
Turning to Dan, who was about to make
some more remarks, he raised his hand
and said, “Quiet, Dan ; and you, mister,
just listen for a minute.”
The homesteader, motioning his ner-
vous-looking sops to stand in closer
behind him, listened.
“If you mean that girl who ran past
here and across that way screaming when
I was here by myself sittin’ readin’ the
noospaper was your daughter, then
there’s been a mistake”
“Shah! a mistake!” yelled the home-
steader ironically.
“But if you’ll just listen a little longer,”
Uncle persisted, advancing a step nearer.
“Stand where you are! Don’t come
a step nearer!” commanded the other,
lowering the gun from his shoulder. “It
wasn’t you; ’twas him !” and he indicated
Dan.
“Mary told us he was a big man with
black whiskers,” the elder son, prompt-
ing his parent, put in, making a bulwark
of the other’s stout figure.
“An’ a wild man with no hat,” the
younger one added, crouching behind his
brother, making a bulwark of him.
“And you’re neither a big man nor a
wild-looking one,” shouted the home-
steader. “And you can’t call that what
you’ve got a whisker. You’re only a
rat of a man. A ’skeeter wouldn’t run
from you. He’s the man!” (indicating
Dan). “Hear me, you, Willie”—he glanced
quickly over his shoulder to the younger
son. “Run back fast over the hill
to where we left your mother with Mary,
and tell your mother to bring Mary here
at wunst. Run fast.”
Then to Uncle: “You’ll soon hear
which of you chased her.”
Willie, after being urged and kicked
at backwards by his brother, was about
to make off when Dan, who couldn’t
stand any more—Dan, though an easy-
going, harmless sort of romancer, had
lots of courage when in a tight place-
advanced on the enemy.
“To blazes with you, an’ your daugh-
ter, an’ your blasted gun, an’ th’ lot of
you! ” he shouted, swinging his arms. In
his hands still were a couple of mussels
gripped firmly.
“Look out for him, father, look out,”
the elder son cried. “He’s got a knife !”
At this Willie made off at his fastest.
,His brother, alarmed, sped after him.
Their father, taken by surprise, forgetting
that he had the gun in his hand, turned
and stampeded too.
Seeing them all on the run, Dan
exulted. He stood and sent such a yell
after them that the whole bush around
woke to the echo. In the ears of the re-
treating ones it sounded like murder!
Dan swaggered back to the tent.
Uncle, calmly seating himself, again
related for Dan’s information all he had
seen of the screaming girl.
“Sure you didn’t chase her?” Dan
asked.
“Me chase her?” Uncle squeaked in-
dignantly^

FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save
money, but if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all
the time is nearer the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one weeks salary, it
won’t provide for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO.
No one week’s salary will provide education for your children,
heavy medical expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have
to save, more or less, all the time.

“Well, did you do anything at all to her
to make her run away screamin’?”
“Now, what in th’ work, Dan, could I
do to make her run away screamin’ when
I didn’t see her before she run away?”
“Ah, well, it’s about time to pack up,
I reckon, and get out of here.”
Soon the fly was down, and their swags
were rolled again. But as they were tak-
ing a last drink of cold tea before pack-
ing the billy-can, another surprise waited
them. Two mounted policemen rode up.
Their hands were on their revolver
pouches, and their faces set hard.
Uncle drew a deep breath.
But in place of calling “Hands up, in
the name of the law!” or something of
the kind, the leader tilted his hat back,
opened his eyes wide, and, after chuck-
ling, said: “My stars! It’s you two!”
“Hello, Sergeant Bell,” Uncle greeted
cheerfully; “and it’s you?”.
Dan grinned, and, taking his hat off,
gave what he called the ’ltler salute. For
Sergeant Bell they had known way back
at Beauaraba, and Constable Bobbie Lipp
was also an acquaintance.
“If you’ve any tea left in that billy,”
the sergeant said, dropping stiffly from
the saddle, “for the Lord’s sake give us
a mouthful.”
Uncle dispensed what was left, and
hastened to make a fresh billyful.
“Well, now,” said the sergeant, stretch-
ing himself on the grass and looking
dreamily up at the sky—“what’s all this
about chasing Murray’s daughter, Dan?
Pursuing her through the bush across gul-
lies and over logs with a big knife in
your teeth?”
Dan drawled “Yairs!” and grinned at
Constable Lipp, who squatted on his
haunches holding the reins of both
horses.
“Which of you was it?” the sergeant
asked further.
“Better ask Uncle that!” Dan sug-
gested as the other brought the fresh
tea and started “sugaring” it.
“Then it was you, was it, Uncle? At
your age it’s time you gave up all those
old habits.”
“It was me what ? An’ what habits
do you mean?”
“This Mary Murray affair, to-day;
we’re here to investigate it.”
Uncle solemnly explained the incident
again.
“It’s only one more of about fifty such
cases that we’ve had to inquire into since
this river tragedy,” sighed the sergeant.
“And we’re riding day after day inquir-
ing into fresh ones. Every girl that sees
a man in the bush now when she’s alone
gets hysterical *, and from her account
of him he is always a wild man with a
beard, and has either a gun or a knife,
and he chases her nearly to the back
door of her home.”
The officers mounted their horses again
and said “Cheerio!”
Dan and Uncle lifted their swags and
said “So-long.”
His Chance.
BY lAN THOMPSON SCOTT.
HE limped up the hot dusty road
carrying a suitcase. From the veran-
dah I saw him visit several houses
before coming to us. At close quarters
it was evident that he had but one arm,
and that his left leg was shorter and
turned out somewhat. Also his face had
been badly smashed and most skilfully
mended. The scars were faded with age.
. He wore no badge, but admitted that
he had been a Digger. Yes, he would be
glad of a cup of tea. He remembered
his unit, but had forgotten the regimental
colors and could not name his colonel
or give any details. He had been wounded
—at Passchendaele, he thought. A head
wound; he showed me the scar and
marked depression. His face and arm
and leg had been hit at the same time ;
but his memory was poor and he did not
remember much about it.
He found it difficult to remember
things. He was now peddling oddments.
Had a regular run and people were kind
to him. It was something to do. No ;
he didn’t read much. His sight was not
too good.
He spoke in a crushed lifeless way as
one for whom life held no savor.
Listening to him my thoughts leaped
back sixteen years to a pillbox in the
desolate waste that lay between Ypres
and the Passchendaele Ridge.
It was the dead hour of 3 a.m. Rations
and reliefs were over and the midnight
hate had lapsed into the steady one-a-
minute crash of five-nines. This was con-
siderate of the enemy, especially for those
with regular habits. If you were careful,
you could nip out, do whatever you had
a mind to, and be back before the next
one.
A squad of bearers arrived with the
usual burden. They didn’t wait for the
interval. All places were equally dan-
gerous for them They just walked
through and took their • . Thi d
The wounded man was from the Thir
Division on our left flank. As a r
lines of evacuation were P re «y j ell^
fined, but we got an °. cc^, sl °eft'
Things had been a bit mixed on the let .
Odd that I can remember very few of
the hundreds of wounded who passed
through my hands. Other medical officers
say the same thing. But I had cause to
remember this chap. For one thing he
left a legacy of mustard gas which, m
spite of foda, took the skin off the back
of my hands and left me unable to speak
above a whisper for a month. I still have
a cough. . .
A yellow cross shell bursting right on
him had hit him in the head, face, neck,
arm and leg. His clothes were soaked in
the stuff. The arm and leg looked hope-
less and there was brain matter showing.
He had recovered consciousness and was
in evident pain, although unable to speak
because of the hole in his neck.
I got the syringe and the morphia
bottle. The bottle was rubber-capped.
You just pushed the needle through,
sucked up the required dose and with-
drew it. The strength was adjusted so
that a full syringe meant a whole gram
of morphia—pretty close to a lethal dose
in borderline cases. Half a syringe was
half a grain. It was thus easy to be sure
of dosage even in the dark.
The question was how much to give
him. Should I let him have the smaller
dose, cobble him a bit, and send him on?
He still had to face a longish carry over
greasy duckboards and mud in the dark,
with a three-mile drive by ambulance to
the nearest advanced dressing station.
Here he would get a hot drink and hot
bottles to combat shock, and a certain
standard of surgical attention, but he was
still far from a c.c.s. with proper hospital
facilities. Later in the war, .of course,
there were such luxuries as gas-oxygen
anaesthesia and blood transfusion to be
obtained at advanced dressing stations ;
but we were still in 1917.
It did not seem possible for the man
to survive an obvious brain laceration
with all the other mangling and shock.
Surely it would be kinder to give him a
large dose and an easy passage.
No ; he must have his chance.
I marked his red tab Morph. gr.|, with
the time and date, added a large T to draw
attention to the fact that he had had a
tourniquet applied, and did some rapid
redressing. A fresh squad removed him
and I never heard any more about him.
Now after all these years this poor
piece of wreckage turns up to remind me.
I couldn’t say if it was the same man.
The name was nothing, and he had no
face when I last saw him. In any case,
I couldn’t have remembered it. The
shattered body was bad enough, although
cripples can adapt themselves. A skilful
surgeon had reconstructed his face. But
nothing could ever give him back his
reason. Months of suffering had cul-
minated in a shattered body with a dulled
mind.
Of course, I had no real choice in the
matter. He had to be given his chance.
But did I do the best thing for him in
the long run ?
Eggs.
I want no beauty rarer than
The loveliness of secret nests
And eggs that nestle for a span
Beneath the nervous mother breasts!
Shells faintly flushed with salmon pinks,
Clouded with lilac and with red;
Buff ovals marked with fairy inks,
Where tender lavenders are spread;
Bark-cradled clutches, apple-green,
And pearly-white eggs hidden low;
O little mothers, I have seen
Your springtide glories and I know.
Palest of blues immaculate;
Whites stained with purples rich as wine;
Creams flecked with umber and with slate;
Greens quaint with tracery of line.
Cushioned on grass and wool they lie,
So wrapped in loveliness, I beg
Of Beauty, ere the summers die,
“Show me your grace of nest and egg!

The Golden Dream.
I had a golden dream. Of cats
That stalked divinely through old Egypt s halls,
Of yellow straw held on some yokel s head,
A bale of purest color; and I dreamed
Of girls with aureate hair; of sallow streams
That flowed down rivulets of gold-flecked sand,
A calla lily in a green vase set,
And amber round a coffee-colored throat,
Of satin slippers on a dancing floor,
Like bright twin crocuses that peep througn
snow;
And of a narrow lane at Indian dawn,
With a dark stain upon the temple steps,
And nothing in the street but startled doves,
Scattered like champak petals in the sky;
Yet in the roadway, glimmering in the dust,
Was one gold sandal with a broken strap.
I had a golden dream of orange groves
And rigid boughs that held the gilded fruit
Against the yellow circle of the moon—-
I had a golden dream, and when I woke
I saw a cat like amber on my bed
Whose eyes had lit my sleep with mystery!
