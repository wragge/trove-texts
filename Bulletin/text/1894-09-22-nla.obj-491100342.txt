Wickedness of Woman Books.
“ A SUPERFLUOUS WOMAN.” Cloth, 316 pp,; 3s. 9d.
This story has charm and power, though too obvious a purpose. The theme
is the struggle between the primal, physical, feminine side and the secondary, lady-
like, conventional side of a London society belle. Conventions hold her till she
is 20 or so, when she revolts, buries herself with Nature among Scotch peasants,
and falls in love with a simple, grand, serious boor. Sexual attraction impels her
to offer herself to him, but his Covenanting principles are so many wet blankets
on the flame of passion, and he makes the grand refusal. Disgusted with herself,
the lady returns to London conventional side a-top; marries a lordly roud; bears
two epileptic infants, who slaughter one another when old enough ; tries vainly to
reform her roue; and dies miserably. The peasant, meanwhile, has kept single
and simple, and grows grey in getting up early in the morning to gaze across
the misty heather and ponder what a Covenanting ass he was.
“ OUR MANIFOLD NATURE,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 271 pp.; 3s. 9d-
“THE HEAVENLY TWINS,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 679 pp.; 7s. 6d.
“ IDEALA,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 269 pp. ; 3s, 9d,
Sarah Grand is the accepted leader of the Revolting Woman, in her
crusade to win a New Jerusalem of Clean Men. “We have lost faith in
our men,” she says in “ Ideala.” “ Why should we keep ourselves pure
if impurity is to be our bedfellow?” And every one of her books has a
horrid example in the shape of a decayed rake who mates with a virtuous
maiden (with episcopal sanction and approval in “The Heavenly Twins”)
and fathers a precocious baby like the one in the Bab Ballads, who “ died an
enfeebled old dotard at five.” Now, against this crusade it is impossible for
unprejudiced persons to cast any stone of censure. Men like Clean Women ; why
shouldn’t women like Clean Men ? It is of no use for Angel Clare, after encoun-
tering a strange woman in London, to come back and tell Tess Durbeyfield, joyful
in her confidence that “ ’tis just the same,” that sexes alter cases. For they don’t,
at any rate from the standpoint of morality and justice. Let us, therefore, be
magnanimous, wish, the crusade luck, and concede that Sarah Grand has a right to
her Clean Man whenever she can catch him,
“ THE HEAVENLY TWINS ” is material for two novels awkwardly thrown
into One. It is clever and attractive, but Evadne is tiresome and should have been
omitted altogether. The “ Twins” themselves are a really sparkling pair, and would
almost justify superlatives if they were not weighted down by the necessity of
providing suitable morals for Unclean Men. It is true that, for a Clean Woman,
the author writes her copy-book headings with a queer fist. ■ But probably nine girls
out of ten would jump at the chance of repeating Angelica’s adventures with the
Tenor.
“ IDEALA ” moralises rather monotonously on the wrongs of woman, and, on
the whole?-the shock to Mrs. Grundy is not sufficient to counterbalance the dulness
from the average reader’s point of view; though social critics may find plenty material
for comment.
“ OUR MANIFOLD NATURE ” is a collection of short, readable stories of no
particular value, with the Clean Man again advertised for. The preface is the most
striking thing in the book.
“THE YELLOW ASTER,” by lota. Cloth, 317 pp.; 6s. 6d.
This is a smart and amusing book, which sets and solves a special sex-problem
on its own account, as already explained in The Bulletin columns.
“DODO,” by E. P. Benson. Cloth, 441 pp.; 6s. 6d.
“THE RUBICON,” by E. F. Benson. Paper, 394 pp.; 2s. 9d.
Mr. Benson is said to be nephew to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and pre-
sumably he represents the power of the Church as called to the help of the crusaders.
He cannot, however, help being biassed by his manhood, and has devoted the gi’eater
part of his space to limning the Unclean Woman, which is not fair. On the
whole, “ Dodo ” is about twice as good as “ The Rubicon,” and “ The Rubicon ”
is good for very little. “ Dodo,” whether she be Mrs. Asquith or not, is an excellent
lady not to meddle with. She talks smartly until she marries a lord whom she does
not care for, and when he dies in disgust and she has a chance to marry the man
she likes she takes a Russian prince instead. The lady of “ The Rubicon ”is merely
a “Dodo” who talks less smartly. All the same, “Dodo” is in her thirteenth
edition, and her sentimental flippancy throws considerable psychological light upon
the dark places of her devious sex.

First-class detective stories, lacking Poe’s subtle literary flavour, lacking also
something of Gaboriau’s minute patience, but strong and fascinating.
“ NATIONAL LIFE AND CHARACTER,” by Charles H, Pearson. Cloth
381 pp. ; ss. 6d.
A cheaper reprint of a remarkably able book by a former Minister of Education
in Victoria, whose death was recently chronicled. It is a scientific forecast of the
future of human societies, based on ample knowledge and adorned by wide culture
and well deserves the attention of thinkers.
“THE WOMAN IN WHITE,” by Wilkie Collins. Paper, 240 pp.: 9d

Cloth, Is. '
Two of the best works of one of the foremost novelists of the age. The first has
special interest for Australian readers.
“ TESS of the D’URBERVILLES,” by Thomas Hardy. Paper, 520 pp.; 2s ; 9d.
This is a cheap re-issue of a book adjudged three years ago to be a masterpiece of
English fiction —a judgment which the lapse of time has strengthened and confirmed.
The Permanent Force.
These are books deserving, in Bacon’s phrase, “ to be, read and digested
books which every thoughtful man should own and study.
“ SOCIALISM,” by Graham. Cloth ; ss. 6d.
The best book extant on the subject.
“ THE STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY”,’ by Herbert Spencer. Cloth, ss. Gd.
The essence of the mind of the greatest living philosopher.
“ MAN AND WOMAN,” by Havelock Ellis. Cloth; 6s. 6d.
An up-to-date statement of sex-relations, brimful of information and interest.
“THE STORY OF AN AFRICAN FARM,” by Olive Schreiner. Cloth; 4g
A tale unique in power and fascination^
“ THE CRIMINAL,” by Havelock Ellis. Cloth, 3s. 9d.
The best popular monograph on the subject.
“POEMS, by WALT WHITMAN.” Cloth, 318 pp.; Is. 3d.
An admirable selection from the works of the Poet of Democracy, with a
valuable introduction by Ernest Rhys. “ Children of Adam ” is omitted" in defer-
ence to English prejudices, but all other sections are well represented. Just fits the
pocket.
With the Tail of an Eye.
It is said that the old magazines—Macmillan’s, Temple Bar, and so on— are
steadily going down hill. They cannot compete with the brilliantly-illustrated
Pall Mall and its kindred, which now vie artistically with the best American
work. -
Everybody who makes a hit in literature now sets to work at once to write
another book and catch the dollars flying. Beatrice Harraden, who wrote the strong
and suggestive “ Ships that Pass in the Night,” Mrs. Cafiyn, and half-a-score more,
are busy on second books, meant to catch the tide of popularity at the flood. Happy
those who, like the author of “Heavenly Twins,” can sell forgotten failures on-the
strength of new successes.
Stevenson has one new story finished—“ St. Ives,” and one nearly finished,
“The Lord Justice Clerk,” For the English serial rights of the latter he is said to
ask £2OOO. What isn't in a name?
George Meredith’s daughter was married, the other day, to an English squire.
Her father’s new story, “ Lord Ormont and Aminta,” which should reach Australia
next month, was paid for at the rate of £lO per 1000 words by the Pall Mall
Magazine. There is no such master of supple, sinuous English as Meredith, but
his books do not appeal to the multitude. Unhappy multitude !
No less than 60,000 copies of Zola’s “Lourdes ” were issued as a “first instal-
ment ”to the booksellers. When last heard of, Zola was on his way to see the
Pope, whom he hopes to exploit in his next novel, “ Rome.” A third, “ Paris,” will
complete the trilogy.
A bill is before the Canadian Parliament empowering anyone to reprint and
sell an English book if not printed in Canada within one month after publication.
Ten per cent, royalty is reserved to the author or owner. The idea is to help the
poor Canadian printer, for Canada, like Australia, is deluged with English books
which give not a cent’s worth of employment in the country.
NOTE,—As most of the hooks mentioned are in strong* demand, some may
he temporarily out of stock. In such case, orders will he filed, and the books
forwarded immediately on arrival of next shipment.

“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tlx© Bixlletln,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and di s
tinclive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility. *
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
arge fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow itS' lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered bjy the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Some fashionable London astrologers pre-
dict that the Yorklet, “if he gets safely through
middle age, will probably live to be old, but even
then he must look forward to physical inactivity
through corpulence.”
Sir George White, Madras commander-in-
chief, has ukased that, in future, R.C. soldiers are
not to be allowed to salute the “elevation of the
host.” And yet the army, at Alexandria, has
been in the habit of saluting the Holy Mahom-
medan Carpet during the annual procession.
Max O’Rell seems to have done at least
one good thing in his new book. He has pilloried
G. Republican Dibbs as the man who said one
year (at the Federal Convention) that the people
of Australia had such an instinct for freedom as
would force them, with very little provocation, to
declare themselves independent, and who the very
next year went to England and took a knight-
hood.
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “ Cannalin ” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies.
Some 300,000 copies of a London illustrated
weekly were seized about six weeks ago in London
on the ground that two “spicy” illustrations
were placed in juxtaposition with an immoral
object. The seizure, however, took place five days
after the Australian shipment of the papers was
made. A very smart and pious trader “got the
office” by cable and bought up one province’s entire
shipment to arrive. With the object of suppres-
sing the circulation of such pernicious stuff? No!
He wants fid a copy for the Id publication and has
sold out, after most carefully explaining to his
most consistent customers what a disgusting thing
this particular publication was.

Professor TODD, Anderson’s College Medical

writes :
It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

The (J(digraph Writing Machine,

ißf ~>=
■ •;
THE CaLIGRAPH embodies all the highest
developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. The
result is attributable to the fact that ths platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but one
fitted with the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their type
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every-
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

(FOR THE BULLETIN)
The ecstasy of anguish passion thrilled,
Before, behind, not now—for thee I hold.
Around me ripples all the silk-shot gold
Of restless hair. Thy pulsing lips are filled
With beating kisses, burning to be killed.
Thy supple arms of fire about me fold;
Upturn thy liquid eyes not overbold,
Rich as the sheen of sun-kissed waters stilled.
What if the future with our doom be rife 1
The brimful present leaves no space to sigh,
With consequence a dim, remote reply.
Thy smile is shadow after sun of strife,
And though, ’fore men, I may not name thee wife,
I, in thy arms, the aftermath defy.

A N.S.W. country editor candidly con-
fesses to a correspondent who pointed out various
errors in syntax and orthography in a previous
issue : “ J.S. : Thank you ; you are correct. We
consulted a local grammarian and be confirmed
your criticism. The grammarian has been re-
cruited and will remain a permanent member of
the staff. We’ll want a new editor soon; so if
you can you had better come along yourself.”

too strong for the barracouta people, because Meu-

In a certain Australian Works Department
A was in charge of a district as Road Superinten-
dent. B was sent up as Bridge Inspector. As
there were no bridges in the district to inspect, B
was kept pottering about doing odd jobs so long as
anything could be found for him to do. Then A
sent him to the capital with a letter stating the
facts in the most considerate terms. Soon after A
was removed to another district, then removed
again, and finally retrenched. As he bore an
unblemished character, and had influential friends,
his case was brought before the Minister. The
latter’s reply was ; “To save all further trouble, I
may as well tell you that I will never give that
man employment of any kind, or allow anyone
else to do so if I can prevent it.” A’s only fault
appears to have been that he was not clever enough
to divine the wishes of the head of the department,
and become accessory to a waste of public money
on an unnecessary official protege.

According to cable, ex-Premier Stam-
bouloff, of Bulgaria, has been stoned by the
populace of Sofia, and narrowly escaped with his
life, owing to a suspicion that he had used ‘‘in-
sulting language ” towards Prince Ferdinand.
Stambouloff was the Bismarck of Bulgaria—the
man who covered the country with roads and
railways, who stood off the Russians, Turks and
Servians, who broke up Panitza’s conspiracy by
going alone and unarmed at night to the house of
the ringleader and hauling him away to prison
with his own hand, and who has all along held
the little wild-cat kingdom together against
enormous odds. And Ferdinand is a butterfly
potentate with 150 pairs of gaudy pants and a
taste for botany, and with more embroidered
shirts than any other monarch in Europe.
Monarchy is a great institution.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1894.
The Queensland Coercion Bill.
Up to date the shearers’ insurrection in the
Western districts of Queensland has defied
all the efforts made by the Brisbane Govern-
ment towards its suppression. These efforts,
it is true, have been so abjectly feeble that
it seems more than doubtful if the Govern-
ment ever had any real desire for its prompt
extinction. It is just within the bounds of
probability that it was considered better, in
the interests of the aggregate Fat Man of
Queensland, to let the disorder run its course
for a while, so that it might serve as an
advertisement of the lawlessness of Unionism
and the incapacity of Labour in general for
self-government, and help to divert public
sympathy from the waxing Democratic cause
at next general election. And, having allowed
the trouble thus to develops in the first
place, it naturally followed that it was advis-
able, in the second place, to accentuate the
magnitude of the crisis by taking extra-
ordinary measures of repression - such mea-
sures as would serve to impress the com-
munity with the idea that the utmost
resources of the existing law had been tried
and found insufficient. Therefore, the pro-
ceedings of the Government, in the first
p ace, were limited to the despatch of 250
police to keep order throughout a district
large enough to make a respectable empire,
as empires go in Europe. The handful
of men despatched to the West were a mere
fly-speck on the great wastes and solitudes,
and they failed to produce any serious effect,
not so much from want of numbers as from
the absence of all means of rapid concen-
tration. If the authorities did not de-
liberately aim at this result they, at all
events, took the best and most effective way
to arrive at it.
As a natural consequence of this policy,
the insurrection grew apace, and when the
panic had spread over a vast extent of
country the Nelson Government rose to the
occasion it had itself created, and introduced
a sensational measure entitled he Peace
Preservation Bill. The leading features of
this proposed law are that, in certain
“ disturbed districts ” the carrying of arms
shall be made illegal, and that any persons
“suspected” of violence, or conspiracy, or
of any felonious intentions towards Pro-
perty, may be put in gaol on a magistrate’s
order, for three mouths, without evidence,
without trial, and without even any specific
charge being laid against them. The bill
contains a number of other features, but
these are its most notable characteristics, and
are sufficient in themselves to cover every
emergency. Between them they provide
that the person who is found, armed may be
sentenced to a long terra in gaol for carrying
unlawful weapons, the carrying of weapons
being a crime in itself and also a sufficient
evidence of the intent to commit other
crimes ; while the person who is found un-
armed may be put in gaol for three months
on suspicion, without even being informed
of the nature of the suspicion, or the grounds
for it, or by whom it is entertained. The
Peace Preservation Act, in short, is a copy
of the various Coercion Acts which have been
applied, at various times in the last thirty
years, to Ireland, with certain obnoxious
details of comparatively small importance
thrown in,
# # •
Just here it is advisable to explain that
The Bulletin does not object, in the
slightest degree, to the Queensland coercion
law, so far as the interests of the Unionist
shearers are concerned. To all intents
and purposes the law already posses-
ses all the powers which it professes
to acquire, consequently it makes their
case neither better nor worse. There-
fore, even if this paper sympathised with
the worst excesses of the insurrectionists it
would still take but little interest, so far as
they are directly involved, in the new
departure of the Nelson Government. But
the object of the new law is not to put down
the uprising in the West ; its own utter
futility is sufficient evidence of that. Its
obvious purpose is to impress upon the com-
munity that the working classes of Queens-
land are a desperate race who can only be
prevented from wrecking the constitution by
a process akin to martial law ; and to scare
the urban population, which has so far failed
to appreciate the alleged magnitude of the
crisis, with the idea that an overwhelming
danger has been with difficulty averted
through the promptness and vigour of the
Boodlewraith Cabinet. If the existing law—
which is quite as effective arid practically as
stringent as the new one—had been enforced,
the desired sensation would have been lost.
But the furious debates on the foolish and
impotent Peace Preservation Bill, the
suspension by the Speaker of half the
Labor members, and the dramatic retire-
ment of the Opposition from the House of
Assembly, have all helped to create a vague and
hazy and utterly unreasoning idea that the
Cabinet has risen in some unexplained man-
ner to some kind of an occasion which is not
very accurately defined. On the strength of
the alleged danger which is supposed to have
been thus averted, the present Ministry may
secure another term of office at next elec-
tion, and come back to do more land and
railway jobs, and lend more public funds to
theparty’s meat-freezing factories, and to make
further advances of State loan moneys to the
Q.N. Bank. The Coercion Act, regarded as
a means ot suppressing the aggressive
unionist, is a dismal superfluity, but, as an ad-
vertisement for the party of Lawnorder,
it may possibly turn out to be a great
success.
• * •
A very brief glance at the situation in
western Queensland is sufficient evidence of
these assertions. Up to the present date,
every person arrested and tried for taking
part in outrages in the disturbed districts
has been convicted. There has not been the
slightest difficulty about getting the unionist
shearer into gaol when captured. The great
trouble has been the practical impossibility
of capturing him —a difficulty which arises
wholly through the vast extent of the
territory over which the trouble is spread
and the miserable weakness of the Govern-
ment forces. The Coercion Bill will make
the Western wilderness no less vast and
inaccessible, nor will it make the Govern-
ment forces any stronger. When some out-
rage is committed 100 miles from the nearest
police camp, the chances of overtaking the
offenders will not be improved in the least,
and when ten policemen endeavour to stand
off 100 angry bushmen in the dark the
Coercion Act, or any number of Coercion
Acts, will make the odds not one whit less
overwhelming. Provided the Government
forces are sufficient to enforce the law, there
is already abundant law to enforce. When a
gang of shearers attack some pastoralist’s
property, it is quite competent to arrest the
entire crowd, and get a conviction against
them—which can be done with the greatest
ease, and send them to gaol for three years
or more, for riot, incendiarism, assault with
intent to commit grievous bodily harm,
wounding with intent, unlawful assemblage,
conspiracy, breach of the peace, and various
other offences. If this prospect does not
serve to restrain them in any way, the
futility of attempting to overawe the rioters
by the threat of three months’ imprisonment
without trial is too obvious to require
description. As for the clause in the Coer-
cion Act which provides for disarming the
disaffected parties, they are already dis-
armed, without any extraordinary legal pro-
visions, whenever the police succeed in
arresting them. When the police are unable
to arrest them then they are not disarmed,
and so long as the offender has to be caught
before the law can be applied no amount of
law will alter the situation to any great
extent.
• • «
This is the position as regards the unionist
who is captured while actually committing a
deed of violence. As to his position at other
times the Vagrancy Act gives almost as
extensive powers as are provided under
the new law. According to its provisions,
every unionist in any of the camps in
Western Queensland can be arrested and
held for months as a suspected person, as a
person of evil repute, as an idle and dis-
orderly individual, as a person frequenting a
public place under reasonable suspicion of
an intent to commit crime, as a person who
refuses to “move on” when ordered to
do so by the police, as a person having no
lawful visible means of support —hardly one
unemployed shearer in ten cannot be brought
in under this latter definition alone, and as
various other things. The Western district
is full of magistrates and J.’sP. who are
ready to rush every unionist shearer in the
country through the form of a trial, and
sentence him to six months’ imprisonment
on almost any one of these charges —always
provided the police can capture the objec-
tionable person and bring him before them.
But so long as they are unable to capture
him, the fact that the magistrate is authorised
to send him to gaol for three months without
trial is of no earthly account, so far as the
intended prisoner is concerned. And if the
magistrate were authorised to send him to
prison without trial for three centuries, it
would be equally ineffective under the same
circumstances.
* * #
The provision by which almost any person
in a “disturbed district” may be arrested
on the sole responsibility of an ignorant or
officious policeman, and imprisoned for 13
weeks without even a formal accusation,
and without evidence, is a gratuitous and
insolent outrage on the spirit of liberty, and,
in itself, fully justified the fierce protests of
the Queensland Opposition. Under this
utterly needless enactment, any individual
who is personally obnoxious to the Ministry,
or to their influential supporters, or to a
magistrate or J.P. or policeman, can easily,
by direct or indirect means, be shuffled into
a gaol, and left there for three months with-
out prospect of redress. Also, there is no
assurance that, when he comes out of prison,
the process may not be repeated. But the
ostensible purpose of the Peace Preservation
Bill is to suppress the riotous shearers
of the West, and there is such super-
abundant provision for getting them into
gaol under the ordinary law that, so far as
they are concerned, this extraordinary
measure can only be set down as an ingenious
attempt to create a panic which may react
against the Democratic cause. And if it is
not intended for that purpose, it only serves
to stamp Premier Nelson as the most com-
prehensive and far-reaching imbecile among
all the Governments of Australia.
“Ghosts:” and Some Reflections.
Dear Bulletin, —The splqudid poem “Ghosts,”
reprinted by you in the issue before last, was
wrongly attributed to “A. R. Rogers in the
Contemporary,” instead of to A. R. Ropes in
the National Observer. What a magnificent
rose-cut diamond of poetry it is ! One of the
jewels which should sparkle, as Tennyson
says, “ on the stretched forefinger of all time.”
I cannot now- call to mind any modern poem of
equal length, or rather equal brevity, wherein
a rounded and complete story is told with such
simple words of thrilling force. Something
like it, in softer sound and calmer perfec-
tion, is Tennyson’s own exquisite “Cross-
ing the Bar.” It is even more brief,
for although the number of lines is
the same they are shorter lines, and in count of
words the late King of English poetry got
ahead by 12, “ Crossing-the Bar ” comprising
102 words and “ Ghpsts ” 114.
» • *
But I think there would be little difference
of opinion among those who really do know
poetry when they meet it, regarding the respec-
tive merits of the two poems. I mean the men
and women who cannot be misled into reading
much of Sir Edwin Arnold or any of Lewis
Morris ; the men and women who feel an elec-
tric thrill start from the nape of the neck and
finish in the left heel when they come upon
such lines as these of Kipling’s :
“The sins that ye do by two and two ye must pay for one
by one,
And the Qod that ye took from a printed book be with
you, Tomlinson I”
or those of Swinburne’s—
“ At the Door of Life, by the Gate of Breath,
There are worse things waiting for men than Death.”
who can recognise instantly that William
Watson’s “Domine Quo Yadis ?” is of a
separate species from anything parented By
mere talent. They will have no hesitation in
placing “ Ghosts ” higher, as a single perform-
ance of clear, absolute genius than “ Crossing
the Bar.” Technically, it is almost flawless.
Mr. Ropes (what a name for a strong smiter of
harp-strings !) rhymes “ her ” to “ were,” while
there are no faulty rhymes in Tennyson’s
much-admired lines, but in uniformity of
metrical construction he scores heavily against
the dead laureate. His words are almost
equally melodious and simple, while the central
thought they serve is in this presentation new
and intensely tragic. “Ghosts ” is “ like a man’s
laughter heard in hell far down.” It is a terrible
authentic cry of the damned. The woman lost
in this syndicated world of God and the devil
who drowns memory in drink, and the broken
man who hides from all that used to be, shriek
out so when the ghosts look in and make them
think. This is a dreadful lightning-flash of
poetry; “Crossing the Bar” but a strong sunset
gleam: an idealisation of thought common to all
Sunday schools. Nearly every right-thinking
person expects to go to Heaven when he dies”
as well as most murderers. ' Very few would
express it as “hoping to meet their Pilot face
to face when they have crossed the bar ”
though; none who had maritime experience
enough to know that just then the pilot himself
“ turns again home,” which is the opposite
direction. But poets don’t rjuow everything
and, on the whole, Tennyson’s is a noble poem*
Still, the obscure Ropes’ is greater.

On the subject generally. The poetry of the
future has been by several writers of
late. In Cosmos, published the other day, Mr.
Arthur Carton closes with Mr. William
Sharp about this and, it seems to me, draws
blood. Sharp thinks the world is hungering
for a return to the old ballad form, and will
not much longer tolerate sonnets. G Alton
doesn’t, but considers that the sonnet has had
its day. Now, I think the sonnet and the
ballad must go—also Galton. Anyone who
starts in to write the records of our past should
dip his pen in rum and post himself in the
criminal slang of several generations, instead of
using the ink - horn of the past to indite
Addisonian phrases. This, by the way,
although it is important. The reading
world of the future will have no time for
expansive yarns of the ballad sort. “Chevy
Chase,” and all narrations of nothing in par-
ticular, illuminated by lengthy descriptions of
the scenery, will be of no more use to the
coming man than the “Faery Queene ” or
“ Paradise Lost.” Neither will he care for
sonnets, in which so much of the best poetic
thought has been spoiled by a tyranny of con-
struction almost as fatal to it as the mechanical
needs of the acrostic.
* • •
The poetry of the future will be in any form
that comes handy, so long as it is short,
and means something which is apparent and
striking. “Do it with your big toe, if you
like, but do it,” was the advice of Turner to a
pupil who wanted advice about methods in
painting. Kipling comes nearest, of the new
poets, to doing “just as he darn likes” about
form and style, but he does what he starts out
to do, nearly every time. Most of them are
commendably sparing of words, though none
have told a life’s story such as is conveyed in
“Ghosts” in words so few and so potent.
That js, I think, a model for universal imita-
tion. Here is the current language of to-
day put to its best use ; here is the very
bovril of expressive speech. There is no
groping in the dust-bin of the past for guidance
—no resorting to traditions and trickeries. The
poets of the future will have to write so. In
the past some of them have scrawled their copy-
on the backs of letters. But for readers who
will scan by electric-light all they will require
of poetry printed by flying linotype machines
the coming poets had better cultivate the habit
of writing on the business side of cablegram-
forms, so as to keep well in mind the value of
words.
WALTER CLAY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Repudiation.
Under the Maoriland State Land Bank scheme,
in its latest form, the province proposes to
borrow £1,500,000 per annum at from 3J to 4
per cent., and lend it out at 5 per cent, on
landed property. The amount lent is never to
exceed two-thirds of the value in case of free-
hold and one-half the value in case of leasehold
property —which is certainly a sufficiently nar-
row margin ; but as the borrower pays one per
cent, per annum off the principal the margin
will be constantly increasing, and under these
conditions the chance of loss will be infini-
tesimal. By a process of compound interest
this repayment of the principal at the rate of
£1 in every ,£lOO will, in 36£ years, wipe out
the entire debt, so that the borrower will pay 6
per cent, for 36J years and then be free of both
principal and interest, instead of, as at present,
paying seven, eight, or nine per cent, in interest
alone, without shifting the original burden one
iota. The process of borrowing and lending is
to go on so long as there is one individual
left in the province who wants to raise
money, and who has sufficient security to offer,
lu other words, it is to go on until the private
money-lender is practically extinct, and the
State is the only mortgagee in Maoriland.
And when this consummation is arrived at,
as the Tory press is now busy pointing out,
almost everybody in the province will be mort-
gaged to the State, and being himself a part
of the State he will be practically mortgaged
to himself. Therefore, when the aggregate
borrower, in his private capacity, falls
arrears with the interest, he can vote himself
an extension of time in his political capacity ;
and when he finds the interest oppressive he
can vote that it be reduced ; and when he
doesn’t pay up at all he can vote that his
property shall not be seized in satisfaction ot
the mortgage ; and, finally., he can vote that it
is unnecessary to pay either principal or in-
terest; and then the country must either “go
broke ” informally or else formally repudiate i s
liabilities. All of which things, no doubt, may
come to pass—in fact, there is no visible reason
why they should not come to pass ; but when
they are advanced as proofs that tire Lan
Bank project is iniquitous and foredoomed o
failure, and as reasons why the private capi-
talist should get his seven, or eight, or nine
per cent, as heretofore, the logic is not veiy
apparent. The one thing that is beyond a
question, in any case, is that—under ndu
suffrage —if the majority of the natio
wants to repudiate the public debt it wi
do it, whether the debt was incurred 0
the purposes of the Land Bank, or for any ot ie
purposes. Also, if the majority wants


repudiate its private debts, it will do that also.
In fact, if a solid majority, in a country that is
run on the universal suffrage principle, wants
to do any iniquity whatever, it will do it, or
attempt it at all events. Some day or other,
all the Australasian provinces may repudiate
their outside liabilities, and confiscate all the
British capital in the country ; there is no
evidence, and never can be any evidence, that
they won’t. But the establishment of the State
Land Bank won’t bring the catastrophe—if
there is to be a catastrophe—any nearer.
Judging by present appearances, it is quite
within the bounds of possibility that the
ultimate destiny of Australia is to go broke, as
half the nations of Europe and America have
done at one time or another, and pay its awful
creditor, J. Bull, a dividend of one Fink in
the £• But j ust nov,r the present and the
immediate future are sufficiently serious sub-
jects, and there is no time to consider what lies
beyond that.
The British Sabbath.
It has been definitely resolved, by the aggregate
foolishness of Parliament, that the New South
Wales “Sabbath” is to (legally) continue in
all the beauty of its howling desolation for a
little while longer. Under the old Sabbatarian
statutes which the country inherited from
Britain, it is unlawful to do almost any kind of
work on the alleged day of rest. There is a
penalty for selling tram-tickets, or ginger-ale,
or biscuits on that day, or for driving a vehicle,
or for supplying tea and coffee to the thirsty
traveller. It is even open to question if the
bishop’s magnificent flunkey isn’t liable to be
seized on his own apostolic coach-box for
driving his master to church on the Sunday,
and the tramway-conductor, and the man who
runs a ferry-boat, and the person who sells a
Sunday paper, and the compositor who sets
up the Monday morning’s issue of the
moral Herald, and Editor Curnow, of
that paper and his staff, and the whole gifted
management of the Daily Telegraph, are all
liable to he arrested and imprisoned under the
grand old Sabbath-observance law. If the said
law were honestly enforced all round, existence
in New South Wales would become utterly in-
tolerable ; it is only rendered tolerable because
a corrupt judicial system winks at all the in-
fluential law-breakers, and only captures some
miserable Chinaman now and then for watering
his cabbages on the Day of Gloom. Still, it
would appear, strangely enough, that public
opinion is in favor of the present anomalous
system. The other day Willis, M.L.A.,
introduced a Bill to provide that the various
things which are now allowed to be done unlaw-
fully on the Sunday should henceforth be done
lawfully instead, and, to the surprise of every
logical individual in the community, it was
rejected by 69 votes against 20. Its chief
opponents were Reid and Copeland, who de-
nounced the measure as an offence against
Heaven, and Parkes, who pointed out that it
was an offence against John Bull, and a sinful
outrage upon the principles of the “ British
Sabbath.” Plainly, the only way to get
rid of the Sabbatarian law is to enforce it all
round. If the venerable statute was set in
motion against everybody who now treats it
with contempt it would not exist a month ; the
only reason for its continuance is that every
“respectable” or influential citizen is per-
mitted to break it with impunity, and, being
so permitted himself, he naturally doesn’t care
a straw what happens to some stray Chinaman
or Seventh Day Adventist or other common
malefactor.
The Registration, Clause.
Amid the mazes of the new Land Bill scheme
evolved by New South Wales Lands Minister
Carruthers, there is one provision which is an
undoubted step in the right direction. The
clause in question sets forth that every selector
■or conditional purchaser shall, by registering
Ibis homestead with the Registrar-General, be
protected against his creditors to the extent of
£2OO. In other words, if a creditor sells him
up, he must pay £2OO into the Supreme Court,
so that the debtor will at least have the
means of establishing a new home for him-
self and his family, and will not be al-
together an outcast. Several years ago, W.
H. Traill introduced a measure which arrived
at the same result by a less circuitous
route, but he received scant consideration from
the Foreign-trade press and party, and his
measure came to nothing. But though the idea,
founded on the U.S. homestead law, is borrowed
from a political opponent, it is none the less
■commendable, and the only regretable feature
is that the Reid Government has not the full
courage of its opinions, and only carries its
great reform half-way. Having once acknow-
ledged that it is undesirable to allow any
creditor to seize the home of his debtor and
eject him on the world—undesirable for many
reasons, but mainly because the process burdens
the community with paupers and outcasts—the
Land Bill should protect the residence of every
agriculturist, and a certain area of land, suffi-
cient for the support of himself and his family,
from seizure on account of any debts contracted
after the measure becomes law, without regis-
tration or any other formality whatever. If it
is for the general good of the nation —as is un-
doubtedly the case—that such protection should
be afforded, it should be afforded to all.
Half the agricultural population—the more
stupid half, and consequently the half which
most needs protection—will take years to
learn the cumbrous formalities necessary
for its own protection; and, in any case,
the registration process will only have the
merit of affording work for attorneys and land-
agents, in drawing up foolish documents, and
Ming them, and charging exorbitant fees for so
domg. The law recognises that it is desirable
to protect every citizen from fraud or brutal
assault, and, therefore, if he has been defrauded,
°r has had his eye blackened by an inebriated
stranger in the street, it protects him, whether
he is registered or not. And, in similar fashion,
it should protect the selector from being made
homeless whether he is registered or not. More-
over, instead of compelling the ejecting creditor
0 pay a certain amount as compensation for the
*ost home, it should make the home itself in-
violate, and thus avoid the whole elaborate
proceeding of making deposits with the
Supreme Court and other expensive legal pro-
cesses. Also, the same measure of protection
should be extended to every home, whether in
town or country, and should cover, not only the
house itself, but the furniture and clothing con-
tained therein. And it should do all this by
the same automatic process which prevents the
debtor from being seized in person and sold in
satisfaction of his unpaid hills. The registra-
tion process is merely another evidence that a
Legislature consisting largely of lawyers
always builds new statutes with a view to
bringing more and still more grist to its own
legal mill.
A Subsidised Arcadia.
The wheel of the “ simple, beautiful, Arcadian
system ” of Pitt Town (N.S.W.) Labor Settle-
ment is round again to the old notch, and the
Sointer stands once more at the signal “ Give!”
■ut there is a good deal of reason why Parlia-
ment should disregard the appeal. This Settle-
ment was started on the understanding that
Government should provide ,£25 for each
married man with a family ; £2O for a married
man without a family ; and £l5 for an unmar-
ried person. Nearly 100 men, towing nearly
100 wives and nearly 300 children, turned up
promptly to settle Arcadia on these terms, and
have been cheerfully ruralising on eight hours
a day and Government tucker ever since, with
marked results on the provincial birth-rate.
Many of the original Arcadians have left the
job, but there are always hundreds ready
to supply their places, seeing that a
good hut and good rations in return for
labor while you are looking round for
something better are things by no means to
be despised in these dull times. After about
six months of country residence the Settlement
had exhausted its subsidy, and appealed for
more on the ground that no one would wish to
spoil such a beautiful ship for the sake of a
miserable penn’orth of tar. At that time the
cash return for an expenditure of nearly £2400
was just £l4, but, of course, the Settlement
was not in working order. Twelve months
have now passed, £4600 has been expended,
and the cash return is estimated at £5O, which,
however, cannot be guaranteed as correct, since
it is not considered judicious to furnish the
public with a balance-sheet. The ship is still
spoiling, and the cry is now for more tar. So
the subsidy is to be trebled, which means
an outlay of £75 for every married man
with a family, and at the Settlement
nearly everybody is a married man with a
family. With this new grant, the Settlement
will have drawn nearly £7OOO of cold cash from
a benevolent Government, and the day when it
will be self-supporting is still far, far in the
distance. Yet in three years’ time the settlers
will have to commence to repay liabilities at the
rate of about £560 a year. Repudiation is
certain. Then the Government may foreclose
if it likes on the 100 huts and the fencing and
the dams and the crops, which are all excellent
things for the purposes of Arcadia, and would
not fetch at auction 25 per cent, of the money
invested. Meanwhile, the settlers outside the
Arcadian boundary—men who have strained and
sweated to make a living with no backing but
their own energy and industry—are wondering
where is the justice of a scheme which taxes
them to feed the people on the other side of the
fence; who, thanks to Government pap, can
afford to work eight hours a day to their ten,
and have a Saturday half-holiday into the
bargain. The Pitt Town Settlement and its
romantic ideals will flourish just as long as the
Government subsidy continues. When that
stops, down it goes like a house of cards.
Night and Day.
Editor Bulletin, —J. Medway Day in your
last issue makes two unjustified statements in
his letter on “Bimetallism.” He says Aus-
tralia is “ within a conceivable distance of the
time when payment of interest on and prin-
cipal of ” her debt to Britain “ will be a physical
impossibility,” except upon the assumption
“that the mass of workers will be content to
toil longer hours and live upon a bare sub-
sistence, leaving the bulk of their earnings to be
mopped up by the usurer.” Now, if the debt be
not further increased, a continuance of the pre-
sent rate of growth of wealth and population
for 50 years will make the existing burden im-
perceptible, or release us from it altogether. It
is quite possible to argue that the money bor-
rowed by Australia has on the whole been well
expended ; and a comparison of accrued wealth
with accrued debt does not countenance Mr.
Day’s assumption so far as present liability is
concerned. The point lies here. Money borrowed
from foreign countries to develop natural
resources is a lever without which often we
could not raise the wealth we seek for. It
pays us to pay for the use of the lever. But,
as the burden of interest increases the fulcrum
gradually shifts up, until by-and-by we shall
be trying to work with the short end of the
lever. The introduction of borrowed capital is
attended with benefit and followed by danger.
So far, I incline to think that in the case of
Australia the benefit has outweighed the risk.
In the future, the risk and loss will outweigh
the benefit. Mr. Day also says that “in paying
interest, we are paying something for which
we get absolutely nothing in exchange.” 1 fear
the sophistry of theorists like Flurscheim
has blinded Mr. Day’s common sense. Among
both individuals and nations, the exaction and
payment of interest are practically universal.
Does Mr. Day think that the average individual
or the average nation is such a fool as to give
something for nothing? They pay interest
because it is generally recognised as not just
that a man should reap where he has not sowed
or gather where he has not strawed ; and
because they cannot get the benefit of other
people’s accumulated fruit of energy or self-
denial without paying interest. If I do with-
out ale and tobacco till I save £5, and lend that
£5 to Mr. Day for a year to spend on ale
and tobacco, I shall not be satisfied with
receiving £5 back at the end of the year.
I must have something for the risk
incurred. For in that year I may die,
or Mr. Day may become unable to repay
me, and then I lose all. Or if I lend a cow to
Mr. Day for a year it will not do to return me
only a similar cow at the year’s end. For in
the interval Mr. Day has profited by the milk
and may also have acquired a calf, which he
keeps—why ? I am a year older; I have had
no milk for a year; that year’s milk cannot
possibly be made up to me; and Mr. Day
profits directly by the difference between the
cost of keeping the cow and the value of milk
and calf. Why should he profit by my loss ?
Yours, Not Much.
&n Insult to the Bench.
The Speight v. Syme libel-case, in the fifth
month of its second hearing, has been made
newly and strangely interesting by Judge
Williams, who enjoys the unenviable privilege
of putting the merits of that cumbersome law-
suit into the proverbial nut-shell. Before start-
ing to sum-up the reasons why Richard
Speight should, or should not, obtain a verdict
against David Syme the learned Judge gave
vent to his feelings upon the subject of plaintiff’s
counsel. Mr. Duffy, the barrister in question,
had been guilty, so the Judge affirmed, of cast-
ing moral mud on the highest branch of his
own profession. He had said to the 12 men in
the box : “It would never do, gentlemen, to
have a case of this kind tried before a J udge
without a jury. It would be cruel to have this
case—a case between a private individual like
Mr. Speight and a powerful newspaper like the
Age —tried by a Judge alone. The Judge might
have been mixed up in politics. He might be
seeking for further honor or promotion.”
Judge Williams protested against the sug-
gestion that a man of his official position
could be tempted to betray his trust. His pro-
test was natural and very excusable under the
circumstances. He took the opportunity to let
the world know that his personal faith in his
own integrity was strong, which faith, as far
as The Bulletin knows, is well founded. There
are, nevertheless, Judges unfitted for tasks
which a Justice Williams is able to perform
with vast credit to himself and to the Law.
The fact that one swallow doesn’t make a
summer is not more incontrovertible than the
evidence that one Williams is merely an indi-
vidual person. Why speak of the highest
branch of the profession as though its height
elevated the character of every man who sits
upon it ? But the irritated gentleman did not
stop here. After blowing a blast from the
judicial trumpet he went on to “ prove ” that
Speight’s counsel was suppressing truth and
suggesting falsehood in reference to this matter
of having the case tried by a jury. Judge
Williams took upon himself to declare that
Speight had endeavoured to get his case
considered by a Judge alone, inasmuch as
he had at the outset filed this notice in
the Prothonotary’s office : “ Plaintiff desires
to have the issues herein tried without
a jury.” Judge Williams further represented
that Syme had defeated the intentions of
Speight by immediately filing an application
“ to have the issues herein tried by a jury of
12.” It is true that defendant, Syme, asked
for the jury, but Justice Williams had no
right to assume that Speight was really
desirous of obtaining any different form of trial.
Mr. Speight’s advisers merely seized their
opportunity to thrust the expense of a special
jury upon defendant, Syme. Assuming that
Syme, the proprietor of the Age, must wish to
put his case before a tribunal that would pro-
bably include several men who read his paper
and were influenced by it, the plaintiff’s wide-
awake lawyers took advantage of an unfair
legal rule. They filed their application, not
with the idea of avoiding a jury, but in order
to avoid the jury cost that now falls solely
upon the other side. By their wily pro-
fessional proceeding they obtained a legal
laugh as well as a jury of 12 at Syme’s
expense! “ If it had not been for the action
of the defendant this case would have been
tried before a Judge alone,” cried Justice
Williams. But the indignant luminary didn’t
Eoint out the important fact that plaintiff
peight’s application was neither more nor
less than a legal trick. Each party wanted a
trial before 12 juryman, and one party by com-
pelling the other to ask for it compelled him
to meet all the expense appertaining thereto.
Thus it will be seen that Speight’s counsel was
not necessarily guilty of suppressing truth, or
suggesting falsehood, when he said, “ It would
be cruel to have this case tried before a J udge
alone.” The fact of Speight applying to have
the case so tried does not prove that he
intended his application to succeed in other
than a financial way. As for the great ques-
tion, “ Ought a Judge to sit without a jury in
cases of the Speight v. Syme character ?” it can
be best answered by the lawyers and laymen
who, after listening to Justice Williams for
the past five months, can now draw conclusions
from his unbiassed summing-up.
«
Of the 16 candidates returned without opposi-
tion to the new Vic. Assembly four were
members of the Munro-Shiels Government.
Also, four of them— Peacock, H. R. Williams,
Isaacs, and H. Foster —have spoken strongly,
or mildly, in favor of a tax on unimproved
land values. Ten are against Patterson, and
six approve of that exploded person. But it
is a fact that an unopposed return is, generally
speaking, not so much an indication of the
feeling of the electors as a proof that the con-
stituency covers a lot of ground and is a good
deal at the mercy of the well-to-do man who
has sat for it before. Three of the sparsely-
populated divisions of Gippsland, one of which
is “farmed” by the delectable F. C. Mason,
Chairman of Committees, were won again with-
out a contest. Ten of the other walks-over
occurred in rugged districts where possession
means nine points of the seat. Also Frank
Madden, the despised of all thinking people,
had a walk-over for the large ramshackle
Eastern suburbs electorate, merely be-
cause there was no liberal-minded candidate
prepared to risk the expense of the canvas
necessary to give him a chance of winning the
seat. Frank Madden’s case is thoroughly dis-
heartening for those who believe that a reduc-
tion ia the number of M.’sP. would tend to
cleaner legislation in Victoria. The fewer the
constituencies the greater the number of eyes
fixed upon each individual member, it is true.
But the larger the electorate the easier for Fat
Man, or Fat Man’s nominee, to get in, and,
having got in, to stop in.
Daily paper item :
Messrs. John Morgan and Company, of Tenterfield,
N.S.W., lately issued coupons and off red a prize to the
person who made the nearest guess as to how long a
monster candle would burn. The police authorities have
now stopped the affair, considering it illegal.
N.S. Wales has now become so pious and so
police-ridden that a citizen cannot even oiler a
prize for a harmless amusement without some
lumbering, unlettered policeman ordering
him, on his own sole authority, to stop
and “get out av that.” But in Sydney,
under the same code of laws, the tote-man
not only runs his illegal gamble openly,
and lights up his premises at night so that his
name and the full designation of his game may
appear conspicuously on the plate-glass window,
but he puts up a big lamp—also with his name
on it—on the edge of the pavement to draw
further attention, and advertises his address
and all the particulars of his trade in the
papers. And the police-force, which drops so
violently on the poor little candle-competition,
rarely sees him. The Bulletin hereby recom-
mends the Tenterfield man to get a new candle,
and start the show afresh, and tell the local
myrmidon, when next he interferes, to go to
bed. The candle-competition ought to be a
tolerably legal affair. It is a game mostly of
skill, not of chance. All the conditions being
known, the time for which a candle will burn
can be estimated to a minute or so.
The woman-missionary to China is thus referred
to by Mr. St. George R. Littledale, who
contributes to the Geographical Society’s
Journal for June a paper on “A Journey
across Central Asia
In this town (Kwei-hwa-Cheng, on the Hoang-ho, a few
score miles west of Pekin) there were a colony of Swedish
girls living alone. They had been sent out to China
through the instrumentality of an American. These poor
ladies had been exposed to many insults on their way up
the country, and to daily ribald remarks in the streets at
Kwei-hwa-cheng, and one shudders to think what may be
their fate. It is difficult to speak temperately of a society
or individual that, in the name of religion, lightly takes
the responsibility of sending these women out wholesale
to a country like China, and when there, leaves them
practically without supervision or protection, and with
most inadequate means. It will scarcely be credited that,
though they usually go about in pairs, a_ girl hardly
speaking a word of the language will sometimes be sent
alone with a Chinaman, several days’ journey in a cart,
to visit some town where there is no European. Al-
together, I don’t think Mrs. Littukdalk or 1 have felt more
sad than we did on the day we lett those enthusiastic,
open-hearted Swedes.
Yet here in Australia are subscriptions invited
to perpetuate this revolting practice; and,
worse still, girls have been induced by the
parsons to trust their lives and their virtue to
the lascivious Celestial. They may seek to save
the Chinese soul, but (as shown by American
social experience) the almond-eyed Mongolian
will give more consideration to the bodies than
to the words of his plump teachers.
After all, there is a chance of a tax on un-
improved land-values coming from the nev\
Victorian Assembly. Many candidates who
waited to get their cues from their earlier meet-
ings had discovered a necessity for a land-tax
before the end of last week, and most of these
shifty gentlemen should get seats. Then it will
rest with their respective constituencies to
force them to reiterate their fair promises and
pin their wriggling minds down to the new
national policy. As for Protection in Victoria,
it can be left to take care of itself. The first
serious attempt to slaughter an established
trade with a reduction of duties will result in
such a demonstration as Melbourne hasn’t
known since the Berry days. And seeing that
Melbourne badly needs a burst of political
excitement to stir its blood, a Freetrade attack
upon the tariff would prove a real public bless-
ing. The Bulletin would like to see the
return of every Freetrader who has been
frightened into advocating any kind of new
land-taxation. As anti-Proteetionists they will
not get a show to do any harm, whilst their
alleged desire for a fair tax on the soil-owners
can be forced into practical legislation.
Dear Bulletin, —At his meeting in Essendon
Town Hall, Deakin urged the claims of Federa-
tion to the van of the Liberal cause, and I had
an opportunity of proving your allegation that
Australians are indifferent to union. The
crowd standing in the rear of the hall grew
listless and dull when Federation came on
the carpet. When Deakin got to taxes and
local works the people woke up and cheered.
My idea is to grapple with this indifference by
Ministerial intervention in the matter of taxes
on interprovincial trade. A Customs Union
between S. Australia and Queensland, for
instance, would be easily accomplished, and the
fact of the union would set all Australia think-
ing. “ The door would be opened to the thin
end of the wedge.” The tariffs of the provinces
named are identical in a hundred places owing
to the common popularity of the 25 per cent,
impost. The thing is to commence where
identity exists, and not let inconsistencies of
policy block all the path. The following articles
now bear the same duty in each province:—
Ale, bricks, baskets, biscuits, spirits, boots,
furniture, hats, harness, ironwork (most),
jewellery, &c., &c. What is to prevent the
two provinces from standing in together
on these things against the outside world?
The thing is desirable not only for its own sake,
but for the sake of the Federation it would
help. At the present moment the fiscal ques-
tion, as a whole, is a mountain of difficulty.
Here is an instance of the stupendous variance
that exists —the item is “ Posts and Rails ” :
Vic.—Free.
Fiji and N.S.W.—Is. 6d. per 100 ft. sup.
Queensland —3s. per 100 ft. sup.
S.A. and W.A.—lO per cent. ad. val.

Tasmania—-j Un(Jer 3 „ 6d per loou> sup-
M.L.—Posts, Bs. per 100. Kails, 4s. per 100.
How can any corporation hope to unify in one
acta tariff possessing tangles like this? The
motto might be given : “ Union where identity
exists, and consideration for the conflicting
issues that remain.”—Fluffy.

N.S. Wales is borrowing, in London, £832,000
at 8i per cent, to pay off certain old 6 per cent, deben-
tures falling due shortly. The Bulletin respectfully
draws Premier and Treasurer Reid’s attention to the fact
that he could probably have got the amount in N.S. Wales
at the same rate if he had had courage enough to ask for
it. All the banks have immense cash balances just now.
So have all the big life-insurance offices—three of these
have no less than £750,000 of coin among them. The
reason is that they are afraid to put it in securities which
can’t be quickly realised in the event of a sudden demand,
and simply because almost all the Australian Government
Stocks are in London there are hardly any safe and easily
realisable securities in this country to invest in. If a
regular local market were established so that Government
securities became readily saleable, there are several insti-
tutions which would gladly put a million in 8i per cent,
stocks and thus earn £35,000 a year in interest rather than
keep the amount lying idle and profitless. But from sheer
force of habit Reid looks on J. Bull as the only available
financial resource, and goes to him, as usual. There is no
beastly originality about Q. H. Reid.

N.S.W. Assembly has affirmed the advisability

The Maoriland Insurance Bill has been laid
before Parliament, and proves to be a widely different
affair from what was anticipated. Its most conspicuous
feature is that it absolutely prohibits any foreign fire
insurance co. with limited liability doing business in
Maoriland, and uncompromisingly bounces the English
offices which make profits in the province, and ship them
away to piy divs. to English shareholders. This is a
great and praiseworthy idea, and The Bulletin trusts
that Australia will presently do likewise.

The amalgamation of the B.N.Z. and the
Colonial Bank of N.Z. has been finally arranged, subject
to the formal consent of the shareholders. The B.N.Z. is
to give £400,000 worth of paid-up shares to the proprietary
of the Colonial and take over all its assets and liabilities.
Also, £300,000 more of the B.N.Z.’s capital is to be written
off to cover losses, leaving only £600,000 paid up, so that
the combined institution will start with a paid capital of
£1,000,000. This makes £900,000 of capital and over
£600,000 of reserve-fund which has been written off in six
ruinous years ; of the £1,636,000 which formed the bank’s
capital and reserves in 1887 there is now but £lOO,OOO
remaining! The first thing which the new institution
proposes to do is to pay off the disastrous per cent,
debentures which have weighed on the B.N.Z. ever since
*B9, Then a steady effort is to be made to sell off the
deid-weight of landed-property and wind up the B.N.Z.
Estates Co., and when that is done the combined institu-
tion will begin to know where it stands. It is already
admitted that the estates, despite all the past writing-off,
won’t bring their book value, so a certain amount of
“ surplus profits ” is to be set aside to meet losses in the
liquidation. Probably the Government may take over the
biggest part of the landed incumbrances at a reasonably
high valuation. But at their best the properties don’t
pay more than 3 per cent, on their book value, so even
the most friendly Government could hardly take them
over, save at a considerable reduction. And if the Govern-
ment doesn’t take them, the combined and reconstructed
institution will have a pretty hard row to hoe.

fhe N.S.W. bank crooks will probably get
out of gaol shortly. So far, no gaol-wall in Australia
has been high enough to hold a well-established poli-
tician. But if Premier Reid lets out legislators Abigail
and Peter Howe without investigating the case of Sweet-
man, the Mount Rennie cabman, who was sent to gaol for
14 years for an offence which would have been met in
noa-hysterical times by a 40s, fine, then he deserves exe-
cration. By the way, the Reid Govt, surely can’t afford
t> release the distinguished political financiers named
without also releasing the gentle Macnamara. A couple
of non-politicians should be let out to leaven the lump,
otherwise it won’t look well.

public to learn about anything new, it would long since
have either annexed the entire pawnbroking business of
Sydney, or else have forced its rivals to reduce their
unspeakably extortionate charges to its own reasonable
level. The co.’s only office is at 74 Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, though a number of other institutions, mostly
run on the old 80 or 100 per cent, basis, use the title in
various parts of the city.

The Australasian Rights Purchase people are
übilant at the result of the Hillgrove water-power
scheme. The shareholders in both companies are almost
identical. The success of the Hillgrove move has already
more than trebled the value of the Colo shares ; and the
promoters intend to fight tooth-and-nail for the spoil. If
they succeed, they will be in a far better position than if
they owned Londonderry and Mount Morgan rolled into
one.
The generation of electricity by water-power
must indeed be a good thing. According to a report
issued by Prof. Threlfall, adviser to the Hillgrove and
Armidale Co., the expense for contracts will come to a
little more than £15,000, whilst the annual net revenue
derived from the works as per signed agreements would
amount to £6815, equal to 45 per cent, on cash invested.
If such colossal results can be shown from a small affair
like the Hillgrove Co., what revenue would be derived
from the Colo, which is so much nearer Sydney, and has a
thousand times as much horse-power and hundreds of times
as much constituency? No wonder the Australasian Rights
Purchase crowd are straining every nerve to get the Bill
through.
If N.S.W. Parliament passes that Bill it will be
a national crime. The concession is actually worth mil-
lions. Why should the State give for nothing so noble a
property to a far-reaching array of ravening grabsters,
who will probably—the odds are 40 billions to I—simply1—simply
turn over their charter in the London market ? Why
shouldn’t the State be its own middleman? The con-
cession is as marketable an article as 24-carat gold at £4
an oz.
••• • •
The Colo grabsters are the moat representative
crowd ever gathered together under the skull and cross-
bones in Australasia. They come from every province—
Tasmania, Maoriland, Victoria, Queensland, N.S. Wales.
If they pouch their glittering prize, just imagine, if
you can, what their position will be 1 Tramways are even
now being run by electricity—and as the Colo Valley
crowd will be the only people who will be able to supply
electricity in Sydney at competitive rates, they will prac-
tically, if not absolutely, own the trams, for which a strong
contingent of their number has been angling for years.
If not allowed to light the city themselves (city-lighting
is, of course, the chief direct aim and object of this
colossal reach-out), they can levy huge toll on any system
of municipal or other lighting. If Sydney wants to
electrocute a criminal, the Colo Valley grab will
be able to quote bed-rock rates. If anyone wants to
drive a printing-press, or a lift, the Colo Valley brigade
will be able to oblige—at a price. If you want to grill
chops, the Colo Valley grab’s electrical stove will be on a
better footing than the gas-monopolist’s stove. The gas
clock has struck 12. The electrical clock’s hands point to
12.1, and a big section of M.’sP. are winding it up with
the Colo Valley grab key.

The Daily Post, Sydney’s projected Demo-
cratic newspaper, is a shining example of the virtues of
co-operative management. The authorised capital was
£20,000 in 10s. shares. Power has been taken to double
the capital. The plant of the defunct evening Echo was
bought, and to complete the payment an advance was
obtained, for which security had to be given. Then type
and etceteras were bought on credit, and security again
given. The capital is coming in slowly, and current
expenses make a big hole in it as it arrives. The first copy
of the paper is still far in the distance. No mere capitalist
would blunder so badly.

First the newspapers stated that one D. Tweedie
had purchased the Londonderry mine; after that Col.
North was the buyer. It was expected that “Roths-
child ” would have turned up, but somehow he didn’t.
Before he had a chance one Lord Fingall appeared on the
soene. There can be no doubt about Fingall’s purchase.
He has evidently come along, with a substantial deposit,
perhaps £50,000. The mining gamblers of Australia
should be ashamed of themselves for the miss. Apart
from any consideration as to what the future of the
Londonderry may be, the great quantity of phenomenal
specimens and the three rich faces in the mine, will float
it in London for double the purchase-money. Fingall
will make a pot of cash out of the deal. If not an ex-
perienced man in the business he has picked it up very
smartly. The writer can imagine the sensation his
£30,000 worth of specimens will create in London, and
with his 'mind's eye he can see them trying to lift “ Big
Ben." It is time the Australian well-to-do mining-men
started to kick themselves. And Wilson was there too I

What has become of the Wealth of Nations? or,
rather, what has become of the wealth of the Wealth of
Nations? The Coolgardie newspaper correspondents
should toe the mark. They made the public believe that it
was infinitely bigger than the Londonderry; they made
Alex. Forrest declare that it was worth a million of
money ; that the reef was yellow with gold, and the
moment the least attempt was made to minimise their
statements they came forward with the assertion that the
Wealth of Nations was as rich as ever. During the last
fortnight they have lapsed into silence, and silence is
always suspicious at Coolgardie.

If well mined and managed, the Mt. Drysdale
mine, N.S.W., might make a name for itself, but it needs
more work and less newspaper yab-yab. The latest is an
account of a visit of some shareholders and directors and
a statement of the manager that h« could raise 100 tons
which would go lOOozs. to the ton, and another that
shares are not obtainable at any price. Now, 100 tons at
lOOozs. is 10,000ozs. or £40,000 worth, and the better
plan would be to raise it first and gas about it afterwards.
That is what a coolheaded man would do if he were
working gold, no matter how rich, in country rock—with
no defined lode or walls. Gold-bearing country like this
is most hideously treacherous, and the shareholders
should be told that the two biggest fools in gold-minihg
are the man who buys shares at any price and the man
who won’t sell at any price.

A Wyalongite writes to Sydney D.T. in bitter-

place, and the monopoly sacured by W. A., where, he re-
marks, a “ 14oz. find is blazoned abroad by wire.” True,
most mines in W.A. are magnificently exaggerated, but
the fact remains that more gold came out of less than
three tons of Londonderry quartz than has been produced
by Wyalong altogether, and the world loveth sensational
discoveries.

According to Sydney Telegraph, “since Sep-
tember,” 452 tons of Wyalong stone have been crushed at

The writer having invited O’Sullivan, M.P., to
come along with a big permanent N.S.W. lOdwt. reef and
to receive £lOOO for his trouble, a number of others have
stepped into the breach. All express a greater anxiety
to get the £lOOO than to prove the reefs. One admits his
reef contains much zinc blende, and other base material.
Another doubts whether any N.S.W. mine is working less
than lOdwt. ore. The writer bars the zinc blende man,
and invites the other to make a wager and he will be
shown a mine in N.S.W. where ore in thousands of tons
is crushed and does not give over 6dwts. standard gold
per ton.

The return of Mills’ Day Dawn United for
August, 5297 tons for 66400 z., remarks Alan Bright’s
circular, is the greatest ever obtained in the period and
the greatest in Australia from a depth of between 1200
and 1600 feet vertical. There are three cleanings-up in
the month, and the normal out-put of the mine may now
be regarded as, say, 4000 tons for 43000 z. The usual
monthly div. of £7500 was paid, but as the gold was
worth over £23,500 and the expenses were not more than,
say, £6OOO at the outside, the nice credit balance the 00.
is piling up can be fairly approximated. The mine is
looking splendid, the reef showing from 1 to 10 feet of
stone, and there are more faces of stone than was pre-
viously the case iu the history of the mine,

The London underwriters of the Great Boulder.
Co. were very sore at having to take so many shares. Out
of 175,000 the public only subscribed for a little over 5000,
which shows which way the wind blew. Every second
man one meets in the city (remarks The Bulletin’s cor-
respondent) has a Coolgardie mine for sale. This will
retard the long-hoped-for boom, and do a lot of injury to
bona-fide properties which may be put upon the market.

Rumoured that extraordinarily rich ore has
been struck in the deepest level of the Aladdin mine,
Lucknow, and that it is being bagged and stacked for
shipping to England. The Wentworth mines being
developed with English capital and owned by British
shareholders the managers “don’t feel called upon to
give local publicity to their returns." As a consequence,
Australia is quite in the dark as to what Lucknow is
turning out. Surely the State should take steps to see
that the N.S.W. public are kept regularly informed as to
what their country is stuffed with.

The tons stone sent by the Young O’Brien

now 200 tons at grass. In the new shaft there has been
met an entirely different class of quartz, chiefly pure
white, bearing free pebbly gold. The Young O’Brien
crowd have 7Ja. on line of reef and can take up 10a. more

including the Pitch family and George Anderson. Old

The comparatively small bulk of the tin output
of the world, and the universal use of tinned ware, makes
it peculiarly open to the machinations of the market-
operator. It is announced that a corner in tin is con-

months ago, and it didn’t arrive. A tin corner is perhaps
feasible, but the figures quoted in connection with the
present move are not big enough to seem a guarantee of
success. United Kingdom tin imports, Jan. to June, ’94:

The old Lucky Hit mine, Tuena (N.S.W.), now
called the Amos, has cropped up again with some rich
specimens of gold in caloite, and the public are told by
Sydney newspapers of the finding of gold in calcite at
1300 ft. at Broken Hill, and of the possibility of an iron
lode at Tuena running into calcite. After all this the
writer predicts a prospectus.

Bodalla (N.S.W.) reefs have reached the stage
here anticipated months ago—they have been proved too
poor to pay under the most economical working. The
“ music of 1000 stampers ” fortunately never started.
The scheme looked well on paper, but several mining men
have bitten themselves and a few of their friends over the
Bodalla bluffs. The old moral: Never estimate thevalu ;
of a body of stone by crushing a few tons, and then never
put it through any other machine than that intended for
general use. Better lose a dwt. to the ton by battery
than save it by a slow and otherwise costly grinding
process.

84C> Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
September 18, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
The A. J.O. Spring meeting began last Saturday
(D.erby Day) with a well-filled members’ stand
an'd a goodish-sizcd crowd in the V.R. stall,
which did not include Lady Hopetoun—much to
the disappointment of the hordes of people anxious
to re-assure themselves as to the state of her Vic-
torian Excellency’s piquant profile. Lady Duff
(she tied the Derby ribbon too high up on Bonnie
Scotland after the Derby, and his owner hadn’t
the grace to let it throttle the good steed until he
got him round the corner, but altered it while
within vice-regal eye-shot) wore the cheerfullest
gown in the V.R. camp: bright pink silk with
intervals of black lace and a floral bonnet; but the
other women in her party presented a very lack-
lustre appearance, like people seen through a
brown gossamer veil. Lord Hopetoun, in a black
overcoat with a velvet collar, had broken away for
once from his everlasting grey race-suit, and
looked as pale and worn-out as a popular actor
(which is only another name for a popular gover-
nor when you come to think of it), and Gov.
Duff’s concession to the turflness of the occasion
was a horse-shoe in a black scarf.
What strikes the onlooker in re the Governor’s-
box nowadays is that not a hat goes up in passing
it, as if salutes were prohibited. There were nods
and becks and wreathed smiles in the days of
other dynasties, but people now parade past the
vice-regal roosting-place as if the cane furniture
were unoccupied. And, talking of bowing, it is
evidently the caper for Governors not to uncover
to pen-ladies of their acquaintance. I don’t know
whether the fashion has been set by a secretly-bald
Governor who doesn’t want the press to know too
much ; but I saw an indefatigable newspaper lady
bail up Gov. Duff and pump-handle him by the
limp right hand, but neither in meeting nor part-
ing did His Ex. bare his poll!
Speaking of vice-regal little ways, it strikes me
that our very best local examples let out a reef or
two in their manners when they begin to forget
the wrought-iron etiquette of their native land.
For instance, it sounds most untrammelled to readl
about the Governor of So-and-so’s single daughter
travelling all the way from one capital to another
accompanied by a single aide-de-camp ! The day
of the duenna must be long past when such things
don’t even provoke a ripple on the social surface.
Not that there is much fear of the Governor's single
daughter running away with papas tame “aide.”
Strangely enough, though “suites ” marry and are
given in marriage all over Australia, they never
seem to attract or be attracted by vice-regal
maidens. Probably both see too much of each
other under various trying domestic circumstances.
But to return to my text. There is a superstition
that the Spring Meeting of the A.J.C. reveals to
the public eye what sort of clothing will rage dur-
ing the half-and-half season; but, as I have grown
quite accustomed to pointing out, in the bright
lexicon of Potts Point there is no such word as
Spring. Society flops out of furs into flimsies as
if sudden summer came with the green peas, and
then we have the hideous spectacle of furry wraps
over muslin skirts, or else red noses over tulle
bodices. Neither do the girls who are airily clad
and yet keep ungoosefleshed force the hot season
upon us to any practical extent. We know under
these circumstances that the muslin is only an
airy top-dressing over snug merino undergear.
All sorts of garments flopped and fluttered in
the searching southerly breeze. One stout society
lady (who amused the whole stand by allowing
her admirer to tie her shoe, in the eye of the mul-
titude) finished off her toilette with a pair of mus-
lin sleeves that filled with icy wind like captive
balloons. Midas’s wife, in mauve crinkled cr£pon
barred with ribbon, held airy chat with a Gover-
nor, while Mr. Midas took the children in to
afternoon-tea as meekly as if womanhood suffrage
were already in good working order. By the way,
it is rather hard on a stylish matron who looks
about 20 in a hat to have a file of children, some of
whom are getting to be big girls now, everlastingly
haunting her footsteps on every racecourse. It s
bad enough (from a butterfly point of view) to
have a grown-up daughter to chaperone, bub to
have the whole family spread out like a fan is
enough to make the spnghtliest matron take to
grey curls and bombazine in despair.
Mrs. “ Uncle ’’ Hutton, in pumpkin green, with
a pink vest veiled in black chiffon, and black lace
hat en suite, was seasonably, though not very
becomingly, turned-out. Mayoress Manning wore
g earl-grey silk, the skirt lined with pink. It is a
'renchy fashion of the moment to have your
skirt lined with whatever your contrasting color
may be. I say Frenchy, because a girl who is
anxious to display a “ harmony ” underneath
sometimes forgets that only the ballet is allowed
to go about with a double reef in its petticoats.
Miss M'Donagh was seasonably got up in seal-
brown, with velvet points and bands of Oriental

} n j n to a race of turkey-tramplers. Another
Melbourne girl, in the “devil’s colors,” black
nd red, came escorted, as usual, by Melbourne’s
«eau Brumrael. The members of “Morocco
Bound ” turned up in force, and the tonnage and
tilt of Wilfred Shine’s cigar gave color to the
flottering rumor that he had been enlisted under
jV banner of W; and M. The Criterion was
represented by Mr. Matthews and Percy Brough, in
r | U inp-Jim-Crow frock-coat and a red boutonniere
to take the ginger out of his hair, which had
apparently been cut with a basin; but men were
no loking matter on Derby Day—the departure
of the warships made them almost as scarce as
tnosQUi toes* t
The calico and fancy-dress ball in aid of the
Boys’ Brigade, in Sydney Town Hall, the other
Wednesday, must be regarded as a “drawn
blank.” There were so many screws loose, for
one thing. The people who ought to have gone,
and did, were not enough to compensate for the
people who ought to have gone but didn’t; then
most of the warships had rushed away, thinning off
the male interest, as dramatists say ; and the floor
was like a ploughed field. The music was certainly
u p to English high-baton mark in that waltzes
were whirlwinds and lancers sprinting-matchea;
but Australians were never born to dance at the
rate of a mile a minute, so the band was grumbled
at even when it played the barn-dance. The
supper was really the strong point of the show, for
the hall-decorations weren’t lavishly expressed.
The pillars were bandaged like gouty legs, for
one thing.
For a change his Excellency attended without
Lady Duff (it is generally in reverse order !), who
was chained to her room_ with a severe cold. The
lieutenant-governoress, in black with diamond
necklace, adorned the dais instead, for Mrs.
Edward Hutton, in a melting costume of pale-
creen and heliotrope etherealised with white chiffon
and cream lace, didn’t arrive until late. The
Admiraless, in what are known as “old maid’s
colours” (grey and pink), went about with her
train in her hand as if the committee had forgotten
to broom the flooring-boards, but the plain dressers
got very little attention.
Those “ ladies and gentlemen ” who had been
naively requested per circular to don fancy cloth-
ing “ to amuse the spectators in the gallery ! ” (as
if society went to public balls just for the glorious
privilege of keeping the two-shilling seats on the
qni vive!) took all my available attention. The
best fancy form was displayed by the “Nancy
Lee” set, in which a scurry of damsels from what
they call the “ Upper Ten ” in Morocco got them-
selves up in abbreviated white skirts, pale-blue
collars and jack-tar caps with varied success.
What I mean is that one poker-backed damsel in
spectacles didn’t look quite the sort of girl who
would stand waving her hand upon the Quay,
and another evidently hadn’t the foggiest notion
of how thick her ankles looked with her calico
skirts at half-mast. And, talking of big ankle-
joints reminds me that the prettiest family of
Sydney girls (some have married well) ought
never to go abroad with bare arms. I sat near
them in the theatre a little while ago, and from
admiring their beautiful faces I fell to picking
their bones, so to speak. Their clumsy elbow-
points were as much out of proportion to their
delicate limbs as a bullock’s-joints would be on a
baa-lamb.-
But I digresifSd from the ball just as I was
about to tell you of the plump society card-
sets led by plump ladies as the queens. Evi-
dently these festive sovereigns had been chosen by
weight, like Xmas turksys. But the kings most
deeply interested me. What must be the mental
stature of a youth who would consent to put on a
long glazed pink calico gaberdine topped off cere-
brally with a tin crown and go gambolling round a
public ball-room as the King of Hearts ?
The card-dresses were not particularly ’cute.
They consisted largely of baggy gowns of
calico in various primal colors with the “pips”
of their particular suite dotted about. The
“ clubs ” set in yellow and black, with a
club in their hair, looked smart in a Japanesey
way, but it must have been very dry work for the
“ caramon cards ” of the suites who danced ladies’
lancers—a pack of cards without a joker ! There
were other fancy sets, “ Powder and Patches ” and
“The Seasons,” but the uninitiated onlooker
would never have known them from evening
dresses, “Winter,” in arctic sheeting and powdered
glass, excepted. One or two unknowns cropped
np in outlandish attire. There was a “ bee ” with
tinsel wings who had to stretch her short skirts
over her knees every time she sat down, and I
certainly think one large old lady, in a wig and a
glaring garment, ought to have stopped at home
and frightened her own family.
Apropos of the card-sets, it seemed to me that
there were two queens to each suite 1 Certainly
card queens are two-headed, but the realistic
organisers evidently overlooked the fact that
when one sovereign was on her feet the other one
ought to have been standing on her cranium 1
Last week was “ studio week ” in Sydney, when
all the local artists threw open their workshops
arid entertained invited guests with views of their
lovely frames and little cups of tea. Every studio
was thronged with “complimentary” and com-
plimenting visitors, but bitter experience has
taught their several hosts and hostesses that when
the tea’s in the truth’s out, and the spectacle of
the most ardent admirer (in the studio) of
00-and-So’s chef d'oeuvre openly flouting and
jeering at its pretensions (when the gallery opens)
must make the artistic circles of Sydney hope-
lessly cynical. Yet the fault doesn’t altogether
he with the visitors. It is only a person possessed
of 40 h.p, moral backbone who can tell Miss Crim-
son Lake to her face that the neutral-tinted land-
scape looks like an overworked blotting-pad.
I must begin the list of music-notices with a
note of admiration against
Maude FitzStubbs’s emotional setting of Mu 8
Proctor’s words in her new song, “ A Broken
Promise ” (mezzo-soprano range). I heard Mrs.
F. J. Riley sing it with strong effect, the other
morning, to Miss FitzStubbs’s accompaniment,
and anyone who has enough voice to cough with
cannot fail to make points with such a tuneful
and sympathetic air, set to so graceful and sup-
porting an accompaniment. I have also received
from Messrs. W. H. Paling the “ Annette
Gavotte,” by Signor Lardelli —a sprightly
measure, though somewhat too careful in the
general effect. The “Annette Gavotte” makes
the same impression upon you as a good little girl
with a clean nose. It is just a trifle too demure.
From that prolific publisher, Mr. H. J. Samuells,
comes the “Nitouche Grand Galop de Bravoure,”
by Ldon Caron. It is a rattling good bit which
goes full pace as a galop should, and was played
with great success at the Lyceum during the run
of the musical comedy. And last of all, there is
yet another “Song of Young Australia,” com-
posed (this time) by M. Amati, and dedicated to
the native-born. It is a weak and flickering com-
position. When the real Australian war-cry
comes along it won’t end on a long, low note like
a growl, as if Young Australia were getting ready
to bite a bit off a book-canvasser.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty’s “Henry V.”
Lyceum “Morocco Bound.”
Criterion “ The Private Secretary,”
Theatre Royal “Struck Oil.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess’s Theatre “ Sowing the Wind.”
Theatre Royal “ Unjustly Sentenced.”
The “Private Secretary” made its re-
appearance at Sydney Criterion amid as much
enthusiasm as attended its first visit in the days
of long ago. Judging from the business done up
to date, this insult to the Established Church is
good for a month’s run anyhow, if the manage-
ment can see its way to keep it going so long. A
few changes—more or less important—are notice-
able as compared with the original production. A
door which used to have its hinges on the left side
now has them on the right instead, so that where
the Rev. Spalding formerly introduced himself by
putting his apologetic head round the door
he now puts it round the door-post. When his
Uncle Cattermole drags him round the room in
search of a hiding-place he now rushes over a sofa,
whereas he used to charge up the back of an arm-
chair and bound over the top. There is a
slight falling-away in Uncle Cattermole, where
Harwood’s old billet is occupied by E. W.
Thomas. The new uncle lacks the impressive
dimensions of the old one, and looks needlessly
ferocious in his make-up. On the other hand,
Gibson, tho tailor, has decidedly improved, and
the Squire, who is now done by Fabert, is better
than he ever was before. The improvement in
Gibson (represented by F. W. Leonard) is largely
owing to the fact that the present tailor makes a
picturesque and beautiful “drunk,” and many
experienced inebriates speak of him in the highest
terms. Thornton, as tile crushed and wormy
curate, has not changed by so much as a hair
since his first appearance in Sydney. The ladies
of the co., especially Mrs. Walter Hill and little
Miss Dot Frederics, are sufficiently good, and
there is no serious cause of complaint among any
of the other characters.
* * m *
Just now, in Sydney, the old shows seem
to pay a lot better than the new ones. “ Struck
Oil,” so far, is filling the Royal to the door, and
the audience laughs at the doings of Lizzie Stofel
as joyously as if it had never seen or heard of that
Dutch maiden before. One Hebraic - looking
youth in the circle, on Monday night, laughed so
violently that he was seized with cramp after the
second act, and for five minutes or so his silent
contortions were dreadful. Then he recovered
and proceeded to laugh some more. Maggie
Moore has apparently been in training of late,
and is a good deal more slender and girlish than
she was on some recent appearances. The wel-
come reduction in the dimensions of this favorite
actress has also, apparently, done some good to
her voice ; that organ is always sweet and power-
ful, but it is also fresher and younger than it has
sometimes been. “Struck Oil” is staged more
elaborately than hitherto, a lot of extra machinery,
derricks, and steam-engines being laid on to lend
realism to the oil city in Act 111. Apart from Miss
Maggie Moore herself, the cast is mostly new.
H. R. Roberts wrestles with the character of John
Stofel, and prospers most of the time; now and
then, however, he gets wrecked on some jagged
consonant in the Dutch dialect, and founders
badly. Also, when he returns as a deranged
Dutchman in Act 111, he looks much too broken
and shattered, and when he wakes up and proceeds
to clear out the city of Oilville with a stick, his
sudden activity is incongruous. Mr. J. P.
West, a gentleman whom The Bulletin has
always viewed with feelings of indignation, does
Deacon Skinner, and inherits the curse which
hangs over that black-coated and black-hatted
iniquity; and the rest of the company, Richard
Stewart especially, is satisfactory. The “Chinese
Question,” which comes in at the end, enables this
paper to state, as one having authority, that
Maggie Moore, in loose pants and a pigtail, makes
an entrancing Chinawoman, and that Mr. Roberts,
as a Chinaman, is much better than it expected.
Miss Moore’s farmyard chorus was encored six
times on Saturday, and then that exhausted and
hard-driven lady shut down on her admirers in
disgust.
* * * *
“ Morocco Bound,” at Sydney Lyceum,
undergoes so many changes every night that it has
become several new shows in the course of the past
week. The only consistent features are Wilfred
Shine’s hopeless insolvency and Elton’s desire to
see the harem; everything else is fleeting and
transitory, and subject to ghostlike departures.
The piece promises to get through its four weeks’
season without any actual disaster.
* * * *
“Henry Y.,” at Her Majesty’s, is going
very strong, and there is no prospect of a change
for some considerable time. The astonishing fact
that all the four big Sydney theatres are in full
blast at once ought, according to all modern pre-
cedents, to imply that there will presently be a
bad smash somewhere, but by all appearances
Henry Yee will survive the trouble, whoever goes
under.
* ffi * *
The Bulletin publishes, on page 10, a por-
trait of Miss Isabel Webster, the young and
accomplished soprano now appearing at the
Oxford, Melbourne. From her earliest years
Miss Webster exhibited marked musical talent,
which her conquest (as a pianiste) of the Clarke
Scholarship gave her a chance to develope. With
this view she went to England, and, on the recom-
mendation of the professors at the Royal College
of Music, took up singing as her first study.
After four years in London Miss Webster returned
to Australia, sacrificing several good English and
American offers to appear in light opera. Since
her return in ’9l she has sung at most of the con-
certs given in Melbourne, including two seasons
at the local Exhibition. She also “ supported ”
Madame Sterling during her recent Australian
tour —rather to the disadvantage of the welter-
weight most people thought. “I am now at the
Oxford,” says Miss Webster, “ which some people
think a pity; but I have an idea that variety is
the entertainment of the future.” Which may or
may not be true ; but this is certain : it pays best,
and in these days professionals can’t afford to sing
for the mere good of their health.
** * *
R. S. Smythe believes that Mrs. Besant’s
Sydney season will be a great success. _ He never
had so many applicants for free admission (none
were acceded to), and the number of photographers
eager to get a sitting from “the most eloquent of
living women ”is unprecedented. Three-fourths
of the Melbourne audiences were ladies.
Mrs. Annie Besant was announced to com-
mence her course of lectures at Sydney Opera
House on Tuesday night, and Cyril Tyler, the
“ boy soprano,” was to make his appearance at the
Centenary Hall on Wednesday, Both these events
arrived too late for notice in this issue, and are,
therefore, so far as The Bulletin is concerned,
postponed until next week.
** * *
The Candidate has been the most popu-
lar Melbourne show for the past week. Speaking
generally, The Candidate is a five-act dissem-
bler, who produces himself with the aid of a chair-
man and addresses a hostile meeting from the
platform of a suburban hall. He is also addicted
to appearing for one consecutive night at a pub.,
whilst in rarer instances the degraded mummer
perjures himself upon a lorry. As an entertain-
ment, he would be absurdly dear at a penny, pro-
gramme included, but since he always performs
gratis and can be groaned at with impunity, large
audiences roll up in the hope that some priest or
deacon will give him beans. Another pointy in
The Candidate’s favor is his habit of shouting
drinks for the committee. Altogether, lie is a
blight upon legitimate theatrical enterprise, and
managers will be glad to see him either elected or
dead. Tlmv would prefer him dead.

Under the political circumstances of the
moment, B. and B. were wise in postponing their
new bill, and although “Lady Windermere’s Fan”
is not a very strong draw at the Princess s, it fills
in the time quite satisfactorily. Oscar Wildes
heartless, soulless play is worth seeing, not for the
sake of its epigrams, which are often meaningless
and sometimes cribbed from deeper cynics, but on
account of its splendidly comic pathos. For any-
body who goes to a theatre in search of unwhole-
some fun there can be nothing more amusing than
Lady Windermere’s sudden awakening to a sense
of maternity. She had forgotten her beloved off-
spring when she took herself off at 2 a.m. to the
giddy bachelor’s apartments, but as soon as her
blackmailing mother says “ God gave you that
child,” Lady Windermere’s face changes for the
better. A strange light comes into her eyes as
she remembers how pretty baby looked in his new
frock, and begins dimly to recognise that Nature
has claims even upon the British aristocracy. One
can understand a proud marquis or a duke being
doosidly affected by this incident. There is much
in Oscar Wilde’s narrative to thrill the peerage
and excite a cheerful contempt in the decent
lower orders. On Saturday the Brough and
Boucieault Co. give a first Australian performance
of “ Sowing the Wind,” by Sydney Grundy, and
this highly-spoken-of play will probably be the
final production of the season.
m* * *
“Quid Ireland,” at Melbourne Royal, is
said to have been acted 500 times by the Taylor-
Carrington crowd in tho back-blocks of this
country. Such specimens of rural drama tend to
keep the inhabitants of large cities from going
forth upon the soil, and must be honestly con-
demned by The Bulletin as bad for the strug-
gling producer. “Quid Ireland” is a collection
of musty scraps from inferior melodramas, ancient
and modern, strung together by Charlie Taylor
aforesaid. That estimable comedian pleads guilty
to the authorship, and seems unaware of the real
character of his offence. His show, instead of
being riotously absurd, is absurdly dull. Also, the
incidental songs are ghastly things set to insuffer-
able tunes in nearly every case. Finally the
sorrow concludes with the rescue of a drugged
man from a railway line. So many drugged men
have been pulled out of the way of a cardboard
train under exactly the same circumstances, and
the train itself is such a disreputable old acquaint-
ance, that the spectacle of Taylor tied to those
eternal rails and struggling to get free when he
hears the eternal puff of the engine is a terrible,
horrible nightmare. Next Saturday (22nd), for
the programme at the Royle is changed regularly
once a week, they play “Unjustly Sentenced. *
** * *
The Urso-Sapio concerts, at Melb. Town
Hall, had the bad luck to fall due about election-
time,’ but the series will not conclude until Patter-
son has been wiped out, or George Turner is
extinguished. Therefore it is possible that these
two capable artists (meaning Urso and Sapio) will
attract at least one big audience before they go
away. A re-opening of the Alexandra is medi-
tated by a hardy author-manager named Inigo
Tyrrell— so rumour whispers.
Percy Grainger’s pianoforte-recital at Melb*
Masonic Hall was quite a brilliant success. The
boy played selections from Beethoven, Bach, Raff,
Schumann and Schubert with charming effect in
every case, and his appearance completed his con-
quest of the audience. It was generally remarked,
and with reason, that if this handsome, thought-
ful-looking little genius had just arrived from
Hingland instead of South Yarra sassiety would
have voted him a miracle. Meanwhile, Percy’s
best musical friends will no doubt manage to get
him a European education, for although he is the
ideal of a show-boy, his prospects are so bright
that it were a pity to make an infant prodigy of
him.
** * *
Talking of prodigies, Madame Belle Cole,
who is said to have “discovered” the little girl
pianist of Cyril Tyler’s Co., will confer a favor on
Australia by not pushing her discoveries any
further. The young lady plugging away at the
box of music is not a pleasing item by any means.
For all the feeling she gets out of the notes in a
general way, she might just as well be treading on
the instrument or smiting it with a hammer.
** * *
The Williamson and Musgrove Comic
Opera Co. is doing a good business at Brisbane
Opera House, but not so good as last year. The
reserved stalls fill up well enough, but on only
one night has the dress circle been filled, and that
was the first night of the season. It would almost
appear that B, and B. had taken away from Bris-
bane the bulk of the available amusement-money.
“Paul Jones” was not a huge success, but “The
Vicar of Bray ” was played for two nights to
houses full only in the cheaper parts. “Ma Mie
Rosette ” caught on so well that it was staged for
five nights instead of four, as originally announced.
One of the drawbacks of the season has been Wal-
lace Brownlow’s sore throat. He was out of the
bill for three nights and had his throat operated
upon, after which there was some improvement.
“Ma Mie Rosette” will be the opening opera of
the Co.’s Sydney season, a fortnight hence. In a
general way, iir is the best of things operatic yet
seen in Brisbane. A great success was made by
Lauri’s wife—Miss Marietta Nash—whose eccen-
tric dancing was a distinct novelty in its way.
“ The Mountebanks ” was to be produced for two
nights beginning Tuesday (18th) and “Ma’mzelle
Nitouche ” on Thursday (20th).

Gov. Norman is distinctly the most popu-
lar of all Australian viceroys. When he visits the
theatre the band, of course, plays the orthodox
anthem, but the boys in the pit and stalls give him
a big chorus of “For he’s a jolly good fellow ” and
end with rounds of cheers. Brough, Lohr and
Musgrove have each declared that these spon-
taneous receptions are without parallel in their
Australian experience.
At Poverty Point.
People reading the gushing accounts in the Melb. paper*
of Nellie Stewart’s performance in “Ma Mie Rosette,”
wonder why she didn’t make a hit in London. There is
ample room for her at present here (writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent) if she will only come and
show Londoners what she is really made of.
Clement Scott has been approached revisiting Australia
as a lecturer next year. He does not strike one as a likely
success. He has never done anything, from a vulgar
public point of view.
Sylvia Grey on returning from her honeymoon found
that a lot of jewels, given her by her Gaiety admirers,
had been stolen. Sylvia, by the way, pines for the foot-
lights, but Mr. Fenwick will not hear of her return to the
stage.
Haddon Chambers was hopeful that the new play he
has written for London Adelphi, in collaboration with
B. 0. Stephenson (it is cabled to have been a success),
would be a turning-point in his fortunes.
Smythe advertised Talmage as “ the man who speaks
with most miraculous organ.” It has just occurred to
people that this is a most indelicate way to allude to a
gentleman’s nose.
"Lady Windermere’s Fan” is the paradox of the B.
and B. Melb. season. The management were more
nervous over it than anything, yet it redeems the failures
of “The Bauble Shop’’ and “Cabinet Minister.” This is
the more extraordinary, because the piece is of the
society class, which Melbourne will not endure, on the
most experienced managerial dicta.
Music-halls copy each other, like newspapers. The
Melb. Oxford and Alhambra each has its star lady vocalist.
She does not deign to sit in the semi-circle with the other
ladies, but the interlocutor respectfully leads her on from
the side.
The syndicate running Cyril Tyler’s tour are C. J.
Stevens, P. A. Howell, and Tommy Hudson—all Ade-
laideans. They made money out of Antoinette Sterling
and Belle Cole.
Gov. Robinson’s operetta will be publicly heard as a
Melb. Princess matinee, or at most a one-night affair,
during Cup week. The Firm’s own people will undertake
it. Miss Katherine Hardy, whose name has been men-
tioned as one of the principal singers, will not perform:
she is engaged for Maggie Moore’s production of “ Little
Jack Sheppard ” at the Royal.
Young Stayton, who has made such a hit as the frock-
coated idiot in “ Morocco Bound,” was until lately doing
small parts with Bland Holt, but drama was apparently
not his line. He is an unassuming young fellow, of whom
creditable things in comic opera were expected by his
many Melbourne friends.
Lance Lenton goes to Brisbane shortly to look after the
interests of Jones and Yorke, who open a variety show at
the local Gaiety Theatre, Nov. 9th.
A scratch performance of “Jack Sheppard,” the drama,
at Melb. Alexandra, was gravely reported by the local
dailies as a revival of “ Little Jack Sheppard ” the bur-
lesque. The Arous even committed itself to a gush over
Dora Mostyn’s “ qualifications for extravaganza,” the
oritio having, perhaps, struck the show at a moment
when the little woman was putting in some variety
business.
In the course of Minnie Palmer’s “theatrical” divorce
proceedings it transpired that “Yours Merrily ” Rogers
had laid down this doctrine in a letter to his fluffy-haired
angel—" America for money ; England for a home.”
“ All the world’s a stage ’’—with the Devil for prompter.

FLETCHER’S PILLS and CLEMENTS
TONIC are the recognised household remedies of
the Australian colonies, and every designing quack
tries to trade on their reputation and renown.
This is the greatest proof of their merit, and
sufferers want to be particular to get the genuine
articles, as regret and disappointment are sure to
follow the use of the thousands of “All-failing"
remedies so freely advertised. The reputation
and wide-spread use of Clements Tonic and Flet
oher’s Pills are the greatest proofs of their ap-
preciation by the public. If they were not as
represented they would have passed out of memory
long ere this ; but instead their sale is greater and
they are more esteemed day by day and week by
week, and this emphatically proves their undis-
puted supremacy. Listen to no argument from
interested parties; demand the genuine articles
and TAKE NO SUBSTITUTE.

A brother of British Chancellor Harcourt,

Graham Berry must be the most agitated
candidate over the Vic. elections. His throw-in

Helen Hart has settled any stray doubts

S.A. Legislative Council numbers six Aus-

The sufficiently-gilded Miss
Chirnside, Victoria’s “ greatest
heiress,’’really did give up £60,000
and a prospective peer in marrying
Mr. Everard Browne. By her

Late ex-Mayor Cripps, of
Bathurst, whose suicide is re-
ported, first became prime magis-
trate of the City of the Plains by
a fluke. The local orange and
green sections were fighting the
seat when Cripps slipped in ahead.
His reign was not remarkable for
gluttony —in fact, it is related that
he once entertained 15 thirsty
Bathurst men on one bottle of
fizz, and, so it is asserted, drank
his own health and led the cheers
for the Mayor (Cripps). His
election was the cause of much
bitterness between the local con-
temporaries.
George Collins Levey has
many irons in the fire. In addi
t.ion to being London corres-
pondent to Melb. Age, he is sec.
to the London Commission for
Hobart Exhibition ; edits a city
paper, the Citizen, in which he
dogmatises on municipal law and
reform with all the self assur-
ance of a recognised authority on
the subject; partly edits anillus-
trated weekly, in which he has an
interest; acts as sec. to a local
agitation for a branch railway line
from Uunmow to Essex, where he
lives; and, it is said, is a candi-
date for the historic flitch of
bacon. With all this work he is
prepared to undertake any new
business which will bring grist to
his mill; anything, in fact, from
managing the National Debt to
selling Australian butter.
Treasurer Holder is, perhaps, the ablest

Father Hilary, of the Passionists, nrw

S.A. Legislative Council has affirmed the
desirableness of having Mr. Wragge’s forecasts
officially published by S.A. Government. This
places the local meteorologist, Todd, in an awk-

that Wraggo has boycotted them, or vice versd.
“Tummy” Wales is getting quite thin,

Our dear old friend, Alfred of Saxe-
Ooburg, erst of Edinburgh, is showing his beloved
subjects how mean he can be. The late Duke
always maintained a State theatre at his own cost.
The present one asked his Parliament to pay the
cost. This refused, Alfred is going to shut the
theatre.
Be fighty if you would advance. Sleath,
convicted of law-breaking, and the Broken Hill
bank-manager who assailed him with a ruler, are
both doing very well. Sleath is M.L. A., and can
talk now in Parliament as he dare not talk abroad,
and the bank-manager is now inspector of
branches.
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, addressing
a recent meeting of electors, was much riled by
frequent interjections from a person on a front
seat. Quoth Dick, in an undertone, “Just you

cursed tongue quiet. He could see a big thump-
ing ahead.
A Victorian veteran named Perry has

Miss Badham urges women to insist on
their political rights. She was invited recently to
contribute weekly to an Australian paper, but
declined, as the editorial policy was hostile to her
ideas on woman progress. As great-great grand-
daughter, in direct line, of poet Campbell, she
considers she has a literary reputation to protect.
The report which lately went the rounds
of the press that N.S.W. Gov. Duff had a nephew
truant-officering in Victoria appears to have been
“sound’’only. Gov. Duff, who is essentially a

likes kilts, has tried to discover this Highland
scion, but has failed ignominiously in the
endeavour.

all his impressions of this country second-hand
from the lion-hunting snobooracy who got hold of
him in his wanderings round.
John Downer, Q. 0., yielding to some in-
explicable Imperialistic impulse, paraded in Wind-
sor uniform for the Adelaide Mayor’s Ball, and so
became the observed of all observers. The com-
ments on his personal appearance were not
complimentary, for his legs are nearly as ugly as
his face. Anyone who knows him will recognise
the severity of this statement.
The young lady who, some two years ago,
went around the drapery houses of Melb. and got
a lot of credit on the strength of her representa-
*4ons that she was a “daughter of the Speaker,”
has much to do with the clerical opposition that
has arisen against him in Brighton (Via). Pos-
sibly had Mr. Bent submitted to the attempted
extortion there would be no trouble now.
According to Parson M’Meekin (Eden-
hope. Via), not only the little town of Harrow
(Vic.), but the big, wide world has lost a triple-
starred genius by the death of David Edgar, J.P.;
for, said the holy man, as he passported the soul
beyond the grave: “If he had launched out into
politics, he would have been a Beaconsfield ; in
law, a Higinbotham; or in literature, a Carlyle.”
Buttering a corpse is a fine art.
A story of Bendigo Lansell. He was
travelling to Broken Hill, and the other passen-
gers knew not the old gentleman lounging in
carpet slippers on the carriage-seat. After a pro-
tracted silence one asked him the time. The
millionaire took out his watch—a good-looking,
{fold one—and, after giving it a tap on his
eg, remarked, “ Hullo I stopped I” And then, to

watch that wouldn’t go.
Charles Gavan Duffy, now 78, is bringing
out a volume, “My Life in Two Hemispheres,”
Apropos, a story is current that Duffy was, on one
occasion, returned to Vic. Parliament by a
majority of one, the numbers being 998 and 997.
A son of Gavan’s meeting an elector shortly after-
wards thanked him as being “one of my father’s
998 supporters.” “I was two of them,” was the
reply. The free and independent had voted
twice.
“Joe” Marks, reputedly the best all-
round man in Sydney at Supreme Court practice,
had the conduct of the Railway Commissioners’
case in the bigProudfoot litigation, and celebrated
the “amicable settlement” by getting married.
Apropos of Joe’s methods of business. A Q.C.
once said of him that he wouldn’t consent to enter
Heaven unless he had previously sent the
Almighty a registered letter stating that he did so
“without prejudice.”
Otto Berliner, of Melb., died last week.
Many years ago, he was a leading man in the
detectives, representing a kind of new school, in
rivalry to Black and Jack Williams, principals of
the old. He was a good detective, but over-fond
of newspaper glory. He was the first of the
honest private detectives to make a reputation;
never a whisper was heard against his personal
character. Newspaper-glory men don’t become
detective chiefs, like Kennedy and Brown.
To get “ far from the madding crowd,” as
R. L. Stevenson has done in Samoa, has for years
been the dream of that modest litterateur, George
Gordon M'Crae, who selected the Seychelles
Islands as his place of utopian exile. When
M'Crae retired from the Victorian Civil Service,
as young at 60 as the average man of 40, he
betook himself to that paradise of the Indian
Ocean, but the climate proved ruinous to his
health, and he has now returned to Melbourne
invalided and robbed of, the hope cherished
throughout the past decade of his life.
Now that new ideas in finance are urgently
wanted, a graduated tax on names might fill a
rather extensive gap. The only exemptions would
be John Smith and Bill Jones, and ladies named
Sarah. After that the tax would get up by degrees,
until a person with a name like Augustus Fitz-
gibbon would pay about £5 per annum. All
hyphenated names would be taxed ; also all
Christian names after the first one, with the single
exception of Mary Ann, which ought to go free.
The Government which wanted to tax a person
with a name like Mary Ann would be destitute of
the finer feelings of humanity.
Cyril Tyler, the boy-soprano, doesn’t take
at all kindly to a suggested method of preserving
his voice : “What’s the good of making money if
you can’t enjoy yourself?” he asks inconse-
quentially. The Tyler is a nerveful boy. John-
son, M.P., took him to the Adelaide Zoo, and
Minohin, the director, showed the distinguished
visitor round, and with him entered some of the
enclosures. Turning suddenly, he saw young
Tyler just about to stroke the Bengal tiger, which
was rubbing itself enticingly against the bars of
its cage. “ Yah 1 ” was the mutual yell of the two
protectors, startled to see a £20,000 voice in such
awful peril, and the indiscreet singer was hurriedly
snatched out of harm’s way.
“ Charlie ” Millar, the rich Australian
contractor, has his yacht in commission
and Somers-Vine and Agent-General Duncan
Gillies had at latest joined him at Cowes to as.-ist
in entertaining Tummy, who lunched on board
the Australian’s vessel. The Saide has just re-
turned from the Arctic here she has been on an
abortive voyage to discover traces of the missing
Wellman expedition. Millar, by the way, has
been bitten by the mania for a double-barrelled
name, and is known in England (per press-notice
communicated) as Mr. “ Gibson-Millar.” No
doubt by-and-by “Sir” will be added (through
Vine’s engineering). A few thousands to the
languishing funds of the Imperial Institute would
do the trick easily.
Judge Windeyer will be
60 and Speaker Abbott will be
62 on Saturday, Sept. 29.
Agent-General Playford
is playing the Democratic
game in England. He re-
cently declined to dine with
Ripon because the wearing of
Court-dress was obligatory,
and he has made it understood
that he will not accept a
K.O.M.G. However, at latest
he had bought a Court suit and
had dined with Ripon. Arise,
Sir Tummas !
So far, office has made no
difference in N.S.W. Post-
master-General Cook’s habit
ofliving. He still wears the
same clothes as those in which
he first represented the miners
who sent him from the pit-
mouth to Parliament, and still
lives in the same £l-a-week
coffee-palace, kept by a colored
gentleman. And Joseph is
wiseinhis generation. Directly
he changes his plebeian garb
for the smug frock-coat and
top-hat the outraged prole-
tariat will jump on him with
all its hobnails. If a democra-
tic politician wants to wear a
top-hat, he must wear it from
the start. Apropos, The Bul-
letin knows one N.S. Wales
M.L.C. who, while holding a
portfolio in a Parkes Ministry,
obstinately stuck to the same
old £l-a-week lodgings, and
thus managed to save enough
out of his Ministerial screw
to give him a modest life-com-
petency.
“Your young Australian sculptor, Mac-
kennal,” says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, “ has a fine studio at St. John’s Wood,
but he has so many commissions to execute that
he already finds it necessary to have the place
enlarged, and the builders are at work. He has
just joined the Savage Club, which, by the way,
is going strong and well, many of the old members
who had deserted it under the Vine rigime having
returned to the fold.”
Dear Bulletin, —You do not do justice to
Mr. Boldrewood in the matter of Mr. Becke. His
acknowledgment runs (I take the Telegraph ver-
sion this time): —
T DESIRE to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. lows
x Becke, author of “By Reef and Palm,” for the South
Sea Island portion of “ A Modern Buccaneer,” excepting
the chapter headed “ Poisoned Arrows,” which we founded
on a diary of a whaling cruise by my late father.
T. A. BROWNE.
Albury, 13/8/94.
(“ We founded ” is probably a misprint for “ was
founded as it appears in the Herald). Now,
“the chapter headed ‘Poisoned Arrows’ occupies
from page 87 to page 110 of 1 A Modern Bucca-
neer ’ (erroneously spelt ‘ Bookaneer ’); page 87 to
98 (11 pages) are by Boldrewood ; page 98 to
page 110 (12 pages) are by Becke. This is why
Melb. Leader unconsciously kicks Boldrewood
by republishing Becke’s particular part of this
especial chapter (without a line of Browne’s part)
as “a thrilling episode from ‘A Modern Bucca-
neer.’”—Yours, Sir Fretful.


POLITICAL
POINTS
The man in the blouse sits in the French
Legislature, but nob in the Australian.
The minimum-wage is coming in Victoria.
Williamstown is the latest municipality to favor
the principle.
Patterson says he has sent word to tne
Colonial Office that the next Yio. Governor must
come in on a retrenched screw.
There is a falling-out in the Maoriland
Woman’s Reform Dress League. There are now
two parties, the divided skirt and the knicker
party.
A N. S. Wales M.P., has already pro-
tested against the action of the brass band in
biasing out, “ Oh, boys, we’ll never get drunk any
more,” at the opening of Parliament.
The Argus with its rhymes for the people,
the ‘‘ creed of the country,” and big italics freely
sprinkled over its pages, recalls John Bull and
the other political papers of the Reform time.
According to S.M. Herald’s Jeames in
London, English Corean-war sympathies are, for
trado reasons, with China. Australians, if they
bother about the affair at all, barrack for Japan.
Speaker Bent, the day after the parsonic
denunciation of him at Brighton, was regarded as
absolutely safe. His opponent, Moule, rushed to
the press, with a disclaimer of the clerical tactics.
“Mr. Mountain,” said the chairman,
introducing W. J. Mountain, M.P., a hybrid
politician, to an Albert Park meeting. Coarse
democrat at the back, “ Yah 1 he’s on’y a mole-
hill.”
Millionaire Burdekin’s successful repudia-
tion of a big grog-score, sought bo be foisted on
him by an electioneering canvasser, was a chief
factor in his recent defeat for Hawkesbury elec-
torate.
The other Australian provinces are con-
cerned in putting down Victoria’s free-pass
swindles. For, “out of courtesy,” .Victoria’s
free-passers are passed gratis over all the lines of
the continent.
Joseph Cook, N.S.W. Postmaster-General:
“I believe in a puritanical Sunday, but it should
be made enjoyable.” In other words, “ I believe
in asafoetida as a perfume, but it must be made to
stink sweetly.”
The dispute between Melb. Age and
Argus as to which party is responsible for Bent
as Speaker, reminds one of Max Adeler’s story of
the two neighbors who spent a day and a night
passing a long-dead dog to each other over their
dividing fence.
S.M. Herald in-
dignantly denounces
N.S.W. ex-Works-
Minister Lyne for
having dared, in defi-
ance of the Constitu-
tion and the Public
Works Act, to spend
£158,000 for Ocean-st.
tramway, when only
£BO,OOO was authorised.
Now, the Herald knew
all along what was go-
ing on, and at various
times published descrip-
tive articles about the
tramway, praising
Lyne for the fore-
thought shown in mak-
ing the additions which
have caused the, extra
expenditure now con-
demned. The Herald
was actually, as far as
it could be, an abettor
of what it now de-
nounces as illegal acts.
Nor did it see anything
wrong when one of the
present N.S.W. Minis-
ters evaded the Publio
Works Act by con-
structing a large publio
building piecemeal—
Jutting the work up
into contracts, none of
which exceeded £20,000.
The Herald’s only
virtue is expediency.
The most delicious-
ly childlike thing The
Bulletin has seen in
any paper for 10 years
is the recent remark of
Sydney D.T., that when
Col. Tom Price told his
gang to “ fire low and
lay ’em out ” he did so
because he meant that
only the crowd’s legs
should be wounded,
and that no one should be vitally hurt. As a
matter of fact, he ordered them to fire low so
that they might have a better show of “ laying
em out,” well-knowing the general tendency to
fire high—and miss.
Only luck can bring S. A. a surplus this yea r,

S.M. Herald, in reporting the speec hes of
N-S.W. Ministers, designates the speakers by the
titles of their offices, and not by their names. It
j* s |d to be “Sir Henry Parkes said.” Now it is,
‘The Premier said.”
One Smith, a pious hatter, has been sitting
•or the South Melbourne constituency that used
to love David Gaunson in days of yore. Smith is
(. slow, methodical driveller, democratic in senti-
ment, but fearfully Tory by instinct, and no live
Bitizen can hear him addressing the decorous
toilers who wear his hats without wanting to
whoop for David. A droning saint, supported by
the Nonconformist conscience, is a sad thing to
encounter at an election-meeting, and when his
n ame happens to be Smith your cup of sorrow
runs over.
S. A. Labour-party publishes a weekly paper
in a week or two, and not before it is wanted.
The Voice, the Single-tax paper, started in
Adelaide by Medway Day, died of Single-tax.
Single-tax has slain pretty nearly every paper
that ever touched it.
The declaration of the Reid Government
that it will appoint no outsiders to the N.S.W.
Civil Service hardly squares with the rumour that
a Minister’s sister-m-law, or niece, or something,
has already been appointed to a sub-matronship at
a Government hospital.
The Queenslander says that the Q. Labor
members of Parliament are “essentially lawless,”
and, in illustration remarks that, in a House of 71
members, 17 should promptly submit. What
would the parliamentary history of the world bo
were such a rule of thumb final law ?
One of the recently - elected N.S.W.
“ solidarity ” Ms.P. has promised to give up .£1
per week of his Parliamentary salary, and to
report himself weekly to his Electoral League.
“ Fined .£1 and bound over to appear when called
upon.” It looks like a political ticket-of-leave.
The Labor-candidates at the Vic. general
election are solid in demanding that there shall be
no reduction of Customs duties on any article
which can be manufactured in Victoria. The
alleged “ Freetrade reaction” was born dead;
also, there never was such a thing at any time.
When N.S.W. Assembly balloted for the
(paid) Public Works Committee, last week, there
were about 100 members present. Of these, 79
received votes. Among the 79 there were 31 who
received one vote apiece. Not an unreasonable
inference ; Of 31 M. ’sP. each voted for himself !
Just before the recent N.S.W. elections a
man who had been chosen and wished to act as
poll-clerk at a country booth, waited on a J.P. to
sign his declaration. He couldn’t write but he
made his mark, which the sapient Jay pee duly
witnessed and passed for the clerk who couldn’t
write.
Parkes : “ Had it been within the power
of the men who lived in the old days of the world’s
youth to deal with the atmosphere as they dealt
with the soil, it would have been done.” Hey,
what! Parkes coquetting with the land-
nationalisers ? The first straw blown by the Old
Man’s wind.
Whispered that S.A, Labor-party intends
to try for all the Adelaide city and suburban seats
at next general election. This will mean the
desertion by the Trades Hall of able and con-
sistent democrats like Premier Kingston, Scherk
and Brooker. If so, The Bulletin is sorry for
the United Labor-party.
The last has by no means been heard of
the big Proudfoot railway-case, lately settled in
Sydney. Owing, apparently, to a dispute between
parties interested, a M.P. has_ obtained photo-
graphs of certain most interesting documents in
the handwriting of a defunct politician, and is
going to submit them to the Assembly.
The island of Santa Cruz has been hither-
to debarred the Queensland recruiters on account
of the poor physique of the natives. “Of late,”
says a sugar journal, “ a better class of natives
has been seen, and the little island is now furnish-
ing recruits.” Pshaw! The real reason is that
the increasing scarcity of recruits is forcing the
Government blackbirders to lower the standard.
IN “A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.”
YARRA BANKER THE FIRST: “Now, Charley, what about the next meal?”
YARRA BANKER THE SECOND: “We haven’t had the last one yet.”
The Southern Government has artfully
‘thrown a beautiful apple of discord among the
Northern and Central Q. Separatists. It is pro-
posed to connect Hughenden and Winton by rail,
thus robbing the Central line and dear old log-
rolling Rockhampton of the best of their trade
and diverting it northwards.
“A straw shows.” When in N.S.W.
Council last week someone urged that troops be
dispatched to quell the shearers’ insurrection,
Chairman of Committees Jacob ejaculated : “Yes,
with Gatling guns.” Considering that Jacob is
dependent for his billet on the votes of members,
the ejaculation is significant as illustrating the
true feelings of the Council majority.
The Aoe omits from its reports of Geo
Turner’s speeches all reference to the question so
frequently put him—whether he will, if elected,
support any propositions for paying defendant’s
costs, in Speight v. Syme, out of the Treasury.
Turner says frankly that he will do nothing of the
kind. It doesn’t suit the purpose that that should
be known, so the answer is suppressed. As a
matter of fact, it is well-known that feelers were
put out to Patterson & Co. to see whether they
would make a proposal to this effect, treating the
trial as a State affair.
The seats of 14 Victorian M.’sL.C. became
vacant this month by effluxion of time, and it is
significant of the hopeless political stagnation of
the country that twelve of the retiring fossils
came back unopposed.
Wise, M.P., fired the first shot from the
Parkesian corner on the debate on the introduc-
tion of the new Land Bill. It will be interesting
to watch the old veteran play the game of his poli-
tical youth in his extreme age.
The Bill providing for the election of
Ministers by Parliament has been lost in Maori-
land Assembly by 27 votes against 21. With such
a narrow majority, the end of Government by
Contradiction is almost in sight.
The two principal “test” candidates in
Victoria are Tom Bent, at Brighton, and Bryan
O’Loghlen, at Port Fairy. If they get back into
Parliament on the strength of their public records
very little political meaning will attach to the
election of the other 93 members.
SUICIDE OF A DUKE.—AN EXTRAORDINARY MOTIVE.
“LONDON, Sept. 13. —The Duke of San Carlos has committed suicide in
Madrid. The Duke was driven to the deed through distress at his inability
to attain moral perfection.” He should have gone for the usual goal,
“Immoral Perfection,” which has, up to date, apparently been
within the reach of every Duke.
Whenever the Castlemaine electors betrayed
a disposition to howl Patterson down he plain-
tively besought them “to respect the position he
held ” As he had been practically booted out of
the premiership, and only recovered it for a time
by the dissolution dodge, Patterson s wail is about
as cheeky as that of the man who stole a white
wig and when produced in court, wearing the
spoil pleaded with the Bench to respect his grey
hairs’. Perhaps, however, James expected the
crowd to respect his K.C.M.G.-ship. There is
no limit to the assurance of such a man.
H. H. Champion, standing for Albert
Park (Melb.) was the chief success of the elec-
tioneering campaign, as a plain, straightforward
talker to the point. Champion says nothing with-
out giving a reason for his doctrine, and at
answering every kind of question from both sides
of it at once, he is a much smarter man than
Deakin. He makes 10 words go farther than 50
from the ordinary platform spouter. He un-
doubtedly educates his audience to opinions which
they don’t come prepared for, as, for instance,
when he tells them that State banks and all
schemes of socialism involving the handling of
public moneys, must do more harm than good if
they be maladministered. He shows them how
Credit Fonder funds in the hands of Melbourne
Savings Bank Commissioners would probably not
bo more wisely dealt with than the cash of the
Savings Bank itself. He insists upon the urgent
need for public honesty with the logical force of a
Mrs. Besant, but in a more worldly, matter-of-fact
style. Champion’s style lacks the features that
most impress an audience, especially a working-
man audience. He is a slight, young-looking
speaker, with a voice unlike a bull’s—no fire,
gesture, or air of “deep sense of responsibility ”
about him. However, he has been a revelation in
fluent democratic argument to the denizens of
Albert Park, and if they don’t return Champion
in preference to the late member (an ex-night-soil
contractor) his failure will be entirely owing to
the lateness of his arrival on the scene.
The Agricultural Gazette, issued by
N.S.W. Government and paid for by the general
community, notifies that its articles are copy
right, and that newspapers which reprint them,
without permission, will bo prosecuted.
Rosebery's translation of Bishop Reunion
from South Australia to England, ripens the
desire for a similar acknowledgment on the part
of Supreme Court Judges. If Law were Justice
there would be no danger in such a translation.

Protection in Australia

tells his own Yankee
paper, the Seattle Tele-

produces “ for export ’
—only?—wool, hides,
skins, coal, tin, copper,
shale, mutton, &c., and
wants —yes, absolutely
howls for I—American
brushes, drugs, hard-
ware, carriages, canned
goods, leather, tobacco,
railway plant, clocks,
watches, books,
papers(!), and a thou-

For the 95 seats in Vic. Legislative
Assembly 38 candidates are auctioneers, estate
and financial agents, and 24 are either barristers
or solicitors, but in only one electorate (St. Kilda)

reduce this country to the level of Uruguay. And

Significant. Graham Berry drops the
“Sir” on his election-posters. When old and
rich and fat and retired, an Australian politician
can perhaps afford to wear a title, just as a man

is the political brand of Cain. It is in polities

When Premier Nelson, of Queensland, in-
troduced his Bill giving magistrates power to
imprison “ suspected persons ” for a lengthy term
without evidence or trial, Glassey demanded more
information before allowing the motion to pass as
formal. Whereupon Nelson expressed his astonish-
ment that any person could be so evil-disposed as
to put obstacles in the way of a measure whose
very title—the Peace Preservation Bill—was suffi-
cient proof of its excellence. Considering the
villainous means by which Nelson proposes to
preserve the peace, that old man’s well-acted
astonishment marks him as a first-class hypocrite.
The Maoriland shearer, who comes over
to Australia so plentifully in strike seasons and
fills the vacant sheds with the best and most
reliable non - union labor ever supplied in this
country, is a dismal commentary on the “federal
spirit.” The Maorilanders fought their big strike
far more ably and perhaps more tenaciously than
the Australians ever did. But while they are
prepared to fight all they know for their own
unionism, a very large number of them care
nothing at all for Australian unionism, and will
help to sit on its head without the slightest com!
punetion. The Australian isn’t a man and a
brother in their eyes—not much.
Eccentric Kaiser Wilhelm has not broken
out in a fresh place—it is the same old place with
a fresh breach in it. This lovely potentate is on
the most affable terms with the Almighty, and
“Me and God” is his modern substitute for
Cardinal Wolsey’s “ Ego et rex raeus ” —with the
difference that God, unlike Henry the Eighth,
can’t hit back. His recent tirade against the
nobility, concluding with the words, “Onward
with God against the parties of revolution, and
dishonour be his who forsakes me!” could astonish
people who know only of the physical ailment*
from which he constantly suffers, and are not
aware that these ailments are fought and over
thrown by the regular use of that world-famed
remedy, Marshall’s Tonic Nervine.
CHANGE OF MINISTRY.
It is hard to get two heads under one hat, or to
get a cabinet to agree—hence, changes of Minis-
tries have become so frequent in our days, that it
is rather a surprise to meet an M.P. who has not
been a minister some time or another. A marvel-
lous exception, however, is the unanimity with
which ministers of all opinions and shades agree,
and say that a better smoke than Frossard’s Cavour
Cigars at 8 for 1/- has never come under their
notice. They are mild, aromatic, and do not try
the nerves.

Among the regulations of N.S.W. police-
force is one that is very much abused. It allows
a policeman, who has “run in ” a drunk, or some-
one, during the night, to leave duty two hours
before those of his colleagues who have nob been
so fortunate —the object of the concession, being,
of course, to enable the “trap” to have a few
hours’ sleep before appearing, a little later on, at
the court to prosecute. On a wet, miserable
night the policeman who studies his health and
comfort always takes good care to make a case for
the morning. Then he is snugly abed by four,
instead of by six a m.

That Sydney Sunday paper’s discussion on
“ The Man I would Like to Marry ” discloses one
unexpected fact. Hardly 5 per cent, of the
women who wrote describing their ideal husband
wanted to marry a teetotaller. The curse of
owlish sombreness is upon the male teetotaller —
female teetotallers are not sombre as a rule, and
no woman wants to marry a half-dead slab of self-
sufficient misery.

History repeats itself. Gov. Duffs offer

“ Murphy’s best XXX colonial.”

In the exciting row among
the Manly ratepayers over the pro-
posed local sewerage-scheme, Dross
backs Dirt. Absentee property-
holders, aided by the more ignorant,
uncivilised and close-fisted local
residents, object to the small extra
expanse which proper drainage
would involve—hence the trouble.
Manly has always given itself airs
as a health-resort, and it is only
as a health-resort that any reason-
able excuse can be offered for the
existence of a place so difficult to
reach. If Manly won’t wash, it
had better die decently. It isn’t
nice to smell anything that’s alive.

An ingenious rascal, the othei
day, wrote anonymously to a pep-
pery and volatile Northern mer-
chant, advising him that his (the
merchant’s) wife had employed a
“ tall dark man with a brown ulster
to watch him on her account.” Sure
enough the t.d.m. with the ulster
was hanging about outside the mer-
chant’s office next day, and the
merchant assaulted him grievously,
without waiting to ask for any ex-
planation. A solicitor’s interview
with the merchant showed him that
the supposed watcher was there on
other business, and the assault was
squared for a tenner. But, if the
merchant had only known that the
anonymous informer was thebrown-
ulstered man himself, and that the
watcher-informer had simply taken
advantage of knowledge that the
merchant was a gay dog to raise a
few pounds, the affair would have
ended very differently.
This week is published the portrait of Miss
Edith Courtenay, of the “ Morocco Bound ” Co.,
who so cleverly burlesques the “ society skirt
dance ” in the musico-farcical production still
going strong at Sydney Lyceum. However, Miss
Courtenay herself considers her metier to be
that of a vocalist and actress rather than of a
dancer. She was the principal contralto (Lady
Sophy) of the 00. lately sent to America by
Mr. D’Oyley Carte for the first production
of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “ Utopia Limited ”
—and returned to London only to be en-
gaged for “Morocco Bound,” in Australia,
whither she sailed at very short notice. Miss
Courtenay was born in London in 1871, and after
various appearances throughout England she
attracted the attention of the well-known
manager, Mr. Marcus Meyer, who engaged her to
support Agnes Huntingdon in the big American
tour of “ Paul Jones.” Her career has, so far,
been very fortunate.
Adelaide has, for 18 months, lacked a R.C-
Archbishop, and now Dr. Kennion has left the
Anglicans. Worldly folk suggest that retrench-
ment being a cardinal doctrine in most religions
the two billets should be rolled into one.
* * «
The Christian World sagely opines that
the reason why Anglican bishops transfer their
services so frequently to England, whereas R.O.
bishops stick to their sees in Australia, is that the
former have wives and the latter haven’t. Always
throw the blame on Eve.

disgust and disdain : “Fust keb on the renk I”
amid the laughter of the crowd.

Judge Harding, in Q. Supreme Court,
recently drew attention to that good old all-Austra-
lian scandal —the lack of provision for the efficient
defence of indigent prisoners. In Queensland a
total sum of £lO is provided for the defence of
aborigines in serious cases—for a white man prac-
tically nothing. In the words of Judge Harding:
“ He is supposed in the most distressing situation
to have all his wits about him and to be able to
meet the most skilled lawyers the country can
provide.” In this matter Australia contrasts
most unfavorably with America, where counsel for
the defence in capital cases is most amply re-
munerated.

Mrs. Besanfc’s orations drew the Melb.
curiosities out of their holes, like moles or bats.
Queer, long-haired people, rat-eyed or ferret-eyed,
with comforters on, roofed in Noaohian style, with
long faded coats of the time of Diaforius, and
boots turned up at the toes. They carried their
Bibles, whatever such might be, under their arms,
and when the meeting was over, there was an
indescribable effusion as of star-dust, and the
people came out with their eyes turned up, like
ducks at thunder.

Mrs. Besanfc has been lecturing on, among
other subjects, Charles Bradlaugh. Charles, with
the mystic lady, is like the other Charles with Mr.
Dick —she can’t keep him out of the memorial.
She quotes him all the time, and explained their
friendship by saying that it was but a renewal of
friendships in other and previous existences. At
their first meeting they both felt a bond of intense
sympathy, which led them to believe each had
found something which had been a long-felt want.
Here Edwin, who had taken his best girl to the

once sets to work to hunt up another suitable
body to aid in the perfection of its diabolical
schemes. If there is anything in this, it is mad-

care of them, so that they may live as long as
possible. Will some Mahatma tell us what body

John Douglas is of opinion that the
fatality among Northern divers is largely due to
the speed at which they are lowered and raised
again. It is imperatively necessary that men
should be raised and lowered slowly. Douglas
asserts, however, that men are plunged almost
instantaneously to the bottom of 25-fathom water
and hauled up again just as rapidly. The remedies
applied to those who succumb are truly heroic.
They are often scalded, like a slaughtered pig,
until large blisters rise on the skin, and make
them regret, on recovery, that they didn’t die
outright.

One of the Speight v. Syme jurymen died
and was buried, the other day, and thereby hangs
a tale. The funeral - procession to Melbourne
cemetery included a cab containing George Moir
and Gordon Stewart, legal managers representing
Syme v. Speight, respectively. It was touching
to observe the manner in which these friendly
rivals stuck to each other upon the melancholy
occasion, each of them being instructed, no
doubt, nob to let the other fellow’s grief loom
larger than his own woe in the eyes of the eleven
surviving jurymen, who were also, of course,
assisting at the interment. No sooner did Moir
(on behalf of the reconstructed firm of Giilott and
Bates) shed a silent Symey tear than G. Stewart
(for Malleson, England, and Stewart) made a
point of wiping his Speighty eye. If Stewart
sighed, Moir sighed, and if Moir’s sigh was
unfairly profound Stewart promptly got level by
passing a hand across his brow. In the matter of
wreaths it is supposed that the contending firms
came to an amicable agreement to give duplicate
orders at the same florists’ shops.

served one very useful purpose. He is the key-
note in the Judge’s summing-up. Hear Justice
Williams on Low : “Why was he not called at
the last trial ? He says because he was then in
the employment of the Age.” The explanation
astounds justice Williams. To his clear, legal
mind it seems incredible that Speight should
shrink from asking one of Syme’s employes to
trip gaily into the witness-box and make a state-
ment against the Age’s honesty. Why wasn’t he
called at the first trial! Why wasn’t Syme
called as a witness for Speight, or Speight called
on behalf of Syme ? And why wasn’t the aunt of
Judge Williams his beloved uncle?

The latest rumour from Rue Australia is
that sundry members of Lane’s own colony are
suffering from elephantiasis, a weird and horrible
complaint in which the leg swells up to enormous
dimensions, and the skin becomes thick and rugged
like the hide of a patriarchal alligator. Elephan-
tiasis is vaguely supposed to be a sort of deceased
wife’s sister to leprosy; it is a disease of slow
development, and the patient may drag his enor-
mous members about for years before anything
further of a definite nature takes place.

A prospective Rue Australian, who paid
.£BO into the funds and then decided that the
Paraguayan paradise wasn’t up to the mark,
has sued the Sydney trustee, for the return
of his money, and got a verdict for £7O
and costs. This may possibly encourage some
more of the pioneers to take similar proceedings,
and may lead to awkward consequences. Mean-
while, Mrs. Lane, wife of the Dictator, is under-
stood to be running a boarding-house in Sydney,
and has no present intention of going back. From
which it would appear that she, at all events, has
had enough of Paraguay for the time being. The
lady’s discontent is based largely on the fact that
she wants a house of her own, “with a fence
round it, too,” so that the rude, uncultured, harsh-
voiced she-immigrant from the West can’t come
in and talk when she isn’t wanted. One of
the first results of true mateship was that this
freckled, hard-faced person insisted, in a spirit of
equality, upon coming in and conversing for hours
in her limited bush vocabulary, and telling
strident, pointless stories about fencing, and tank-
sinking, and swagmen, till life became a misery
and a nightmare. Yet the spirit of mateship
made it impossible to turn her out, and the
Dictator’s poor little wife was well-nigh talked to
death, and the fencing and tank-sinking yarns
will ring in her ears for the rest of her days.

At present there are five men in the
Debtors’ Ward at Darlinghurst prison under com-
mittal for contempt in disobeying Divorce Court
decrees. Strangely enough, four of these prisoners’
wives were born in Windsor, N.S.W. Matri-
monially-inclined young men should paste this in
their hats.
The Society of Woman Journalists, Lon-
don, says that it will admit men to its club when
men’s clubs are thrown open to women. That
will be never, for a man’s club is an institution
deliberately established for the purpose of getting
away from women. However, a very short experi-
ence of women’s clubs shows that they are by no
means designed to afford facilities for keeping
away from men. Rather are they man traps.
Look, for instance, at the Austral Salon, which,
from an outside view, always recalls a lot of fox-
terriers crowding round a tenanted rat-trap. The
rat-trap, of course, is the club, the time is the
Salon reception-day, and the imprisoned man is
the literary or other lion of the hour, to whom
homage is being paid.

the Diamantina, about 14 years ago. He had
been sent out by the Q. Govt, to find the bodies of

wore a half-sovereign on his watch-chain, with

The hospitality of outback stations is often
imposed upon by travelling unemployed managers,
jackeroos, &0., who, after introducing themselves
into the family, are loath to leave. Scene;

“ Aw, I’ll trouble you, Mr. Woolley, for a little

merely expense to the station.”
The rush of Vic. society women Westra-
Hawards dates from the return of that opera co.,

A very notable Sydney man, who indulges
in spasmodic “ bursts,” when on one jamboree
flung away his false-teeth overnight and had to
waste four hours next morning with a shovel and
a rake to find them. On another occasion his
doctor found him standing on his head, with his
head in a hole in the ground, which he had himself
just dug. “What were you doing?” asked the
doctor, when he had up-ended him. “ Trying to
bury ray brains ; they’re no use to me now.”

A Victorian youth named Oockroft is in
custody charged with murdering his step-sister.
He wanted to marry her, and when she refused
ho is alleged to have stunned her with a stick and
then sawn her head partly off. The front name
of the accused is Elijah. Any father who christens
his son Elijah or Jedediah sends him forth to run
in life’s race under a 481 b. handicap.

Cape Colony has now, as the price of
“cheap and reliable ” nigger-labor, 600 lepers on
Booben Island leper-station, and is daily adding
to this gruesome collection of rotting humanity.
Two medical attendants are in charge of the
station. Two doctors to this mass of corruption,
600 strong! When the lepers numbered but 60
there were two medicos j and even then com-
plaints were heard of the insufficiency.
It’s a pretty safe criterion of a she-
Boribbler’s status that she calls herself “lady”-
Journalist. Malice and raillinography don’t make
a presswoman, any more than cub-reporting makes
a pressman. The coming curse of journalism is
the crowd of women who cannot be laboriously
smart without being most un-laboriously spiteful.

Apropos of cheap vegetables. A man
sold Is. fid. worth at a Sydney suburban house.
Later, another offered a similar amount of stuff for
9d. No. 1 was asked next time why he sold so
much higher than others? “Oh ! they steals ’em,
mum,” was the reply—“ steals ’em from our gar-
dings.” This is like the broom-sellers’ yarn in one
of Lytton’s novels. A man who stole the handles
and stole the fibre and stole the twine to make up
his brooms still found he was undersold by a
rival. So he went despairingly and asked him
how it was done. “Oh,” said the rival, “I steals
mv brooms ready -made !”

The other day, at Circular Quay, Sydney,
a stout, pleasant-looking, middle-aged lady with a
straw hat on her head and pinned to her back
hair, an umbrella in one hand and a purse in the
other, made a jump for a departing North Shore
boat, and fell overboard. It was fully 40seo.
before she came up again, and meanwhile the
steamer put back, and two dozen men lay down
flat on the edge of the wharf and grabbed ineffeo-
tically at the green waves, and there was a rush
with life-buoys, ropes, and boat-hooks, and two
ladies went into hysterics. Then the straw hat
appeared again, and the stout lady was seized by
every part of her frock at once, and landed safely
on^the 1 wharf. She came up smiling, just aB she
had gone down, with her umbrella in one hand
and her purse in the other, and after she had
shaken the water out of her dress and thankedJier
rescuers she got on board and went her way. Thk
Bulletin reckons that woman should have a vote,
whoever else goes without.

Dear Bulletin, —In thinking over the
criticism of the late lamented Talmage on the
theory of the evolutionists, I was reminded that
most of the unco’ guid who flout the glonfied-
monkey theory are men who shave their upper
lips, and let a (monkey) beard grow all round the
outskirts of their features. Even a tolerably
good-looking man will look like a monkey under
the circumstances; and to hear one of these gentle-
men raving about the descent of man from angels
is most consoling. Why do certain sects attach a
pious significance to the wearing of the shaven
upper lip and an “ atrocious coal-heavers collar
throat-beard? Every Brigham Young you meet
in life wears either a monkey beard or a shaven
upper lip.—S.S.

LOST LIGHT.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
In starless night I heeded not
The utter blank above ;
I dree’d a lonely, changeless lot,
Untouched nor cheered by Love,
A meteor shot across the sky—
Brief blaze of dazzling light—
And evermore aware was I
How dreary was the night.
So, life was blank before you crossed
Its aimless, cheerless ways ;
Then Love flashed—star-like—and was lost,
Save mem’ry of its rays.
Had heart ne’er thrilled with love for you,
Nor sight the meteor seen.
Night’s dreariness I never knew,
Nor—what life might have been.
Warrego.
THE BREAKER.
THE RULING PASSION.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
** Is it a bargain—yes, or no ?”
Madge tossed her head and did not speak—
The blush that ought to come and go
She could not summon to her cheek.
His wooing was so rough and plain,
Unsoftened by one fond caress ;
A hand to give, a wife to gain—-
How like a man of business I
When “ No ” was almost on her tongue
Fair cousin Amy met her eye :
A forward creature, plump and young,
Who would not make the same reply.
And since, by nature’s simple law,
Madge hated Amy more or less,
She took her suitor’s honest paw
And closed the bargain with a “ Yes."

W. J. Hegarty : Letter for you at Richmond
P.O Renunciation : Verse quite unsuitable for 8.,
which counts “self-development higher than self-sacri-
fice,” and tries to teach its readers to base their morality
on utility tested by consolidated race-experience rather
than on unproven myth interpreted hy dubious dogma.
You strike not “ the human,” but the anti-human “ key-
note.” The natural man doesn’t want to renounce any-
thing. His appetites are all good and desirable, and need
only self-control in the light of self-knowledge
W.B.M. : It’s so unintelligible that it ought to be poetry ;
but on the whole it isn’t Lastor : We don’t “ object to
love ballads we revel in ’em. But nine lines of bottled
fog don’t constitute a ballad... E. M‘K : Two grains to
the ton D.W.B. : Don’t worry Bulletin G.T.tl. :
We hesitate to translate the initials in your case F.P.:
Can’t see that germ... H.E. : Apparently an echo caught
from Cowper Wyalong : Can’t read it: looks as if you
exploded a plug of dynamite in the ink-bottle ...Ingle-
field : Show sympathetic observation ; but thought wants
strengthening and you are a slave to your rhymes
J.P.; Haven’t the least idea what it’s all about, but quite
agree with you, to save time J.E.M. ; Try and
expand metrically in blank verse, or Whitman fashion
if you must, getting sonorous, melodic rhythm —
Saunterer: Small freckles of humor on avast expanse of
g100m... F.J.L. : We’re weary of the man who lies in
bed of a morning writing “Advance Australia” odes
while his wife gets up to chop the wood . ~.C.H.: Just
send along those Victorian stamps ; it’s all the same to
us... .H.V.: The ’prentice hand is too visible.... M.M.M.:
Send stamps for return... Mao.: That subject needs
dexterous treatment W.A.8.: Pleasant rambling
rhymes, lacking pith for print J.W.: The Muse has
cheated you; it’s Msevius, not Juvenal P.M.: “Passion-
fruit ” uninspired and dangerously near anti-climax.. .
Paul T.: Painfully long and archaic.. . G.H.W. : You
seem too healthy, well-regulated a person to be a poet....
T.E.H.: The Bulletin isn’t a Xmas pantomime, nor yet
a family-vault G.D.M.: Evidently a careful person who
didn’t wish to be bombarded with ordinary black and mid-
night roof-rakes. The Argus is a great moral educator—
Robin Hood : All flat D. Ellis : The rascals printed it
as original, anyhow S.S.: A white miner’s pay in the
Transvaal is about £2O per month, but not much white
labour Is employed M.M.: You can’t dilate upon the
abortion question in a paper of general circulation. Try
a medical journal M.G.: You don’t let us into the
secret. We don’t print conundrums Oko.: Prices are
increased by Protection, are they? Well, formerly (in
Freetrade days) the Melbourne conservative organ was
3d., now it is down to a penny... A.C.: In Queensland a
miner’s right issued on one goldfield is not available for
any other unless so endorsed by the issuing Warden.
This is similar to the W.A. regulation, and up North it
works all right A right issued to a Chinaman in Queens-
land is only available on the goldfield where issued
B. Nord: If you think bad handwriting a sign of genius
you are very sadly mistaken. In Tub Bulletin’s experi-
ence, 99 out of every hundred people who produce any-
thing worth reading write remarkably legible hands,
and the rule applies to women as well as to men
J.C.V.: (1) Quite possible; but a coach is a help. (2)
The exams, are not difficult. First the “law matric.,”
almost identical with the ordinary matriculation ; then
an exam, in general history. Then you serve five years’
articles—you must be articled—to a solicitor, during
which time you will have to pass three law exams. If
successful in these you apply to the court for enshark-
ment, and then you start as a money-lender, like the rest
of ’em Delmer: Too “juicy.” The general public
wouldn’t stand it Bookey : Sorry. Hope you’ll keep
him posted Orlo: Mrs. Besant, we believe, married
the novelist’s brother W.J.H. (Melb.); To read yrur
miscroscopic scrawl we have to employ a glass... One
Who Knows (Melb.): A man who buys three-ha’p’orth (t
oranges isn’t necessarily a mean man. That may be all
the oranges he can hold. The writer once knew a rich
man who lunched habitually on a halfpenny biscuit.
Still he wasn’t mean ; he drank 3s. 6d. worth of port with
it Tim Bobbin (Walgett): Your “tight place” is a
glaring lie, and—what is worse—an old lie, and a stupid
one, as well H.E. (Lithgow): Why does your local
band want “honorary subscribers?” And what is an
“honorary subscriber?” S. Smith : A fowl sitting on a
wire is not of general interest... .Old Nick ; Thanks
Rados: Sounds like something we have heard several
dozen times before,.. Manaanan Machirr: Where, in the
name of the great original kangaroo, did you get your
name?... Gas Co.; The Bulletin doesn’t profess to know
the answer to any one of your questions. We would need
to be a prophet and a clairvoyant microscope and a six-
barrelled revolving encyclopaedia to answer them... R.
Dillon: The “Christian Gentleman” has been already
dealt with Prospector (Coolgardie): Thanks Ahem
(Tas.): The matter in question was the rate of
pawnbroker’s interest on pledges only, therefore, your
argument is wholly irrelevant, if not more so
le-rong (Emmaville): A powerful lie, but lacks artistic
finish and chiaro-osouro, so to speak Wager (Nannine):
We have asked every poker-sharp of our acquaintance
unavailingly. and we give the question up Fossicker
(Wattle Flat): Very thrilling, no doubt, at Wattle Flat,
but of little interest elsewhere—excepting the young
lady whose dress only came down to her knees. She
would be of interest anywhere Obadiah : Not original.
G.N. (Wanganui): A moderately good story when it
was new, but the same old caid yarn has been talked to
death long, long ago Turon; Many thanks. Willuse...
B.: What guarantee is there that Mrs. Besant will not
become something else? A.P.: Anyone can run a
paper better than an editor C.W.P.P.: And you have
really taken five years to compose thatl J.R.8.: If
Australia can well spare The Bulletin it could much
more easily spare the Leader, which does not now enjoy
one-fourth the circulation of this paper. ..Omani:
The Bulletin does not wish to be “on file at the local
Athenasum.” The Bulletin wants to sell as many copies
and to have as few free readers as possible, and it will be
greatly obliged to any parson who succeeds in having it
tabooed at any public reading-rooms. In fact, any shep-
herd who can prove that he has been the means of
securing its exclusion from a reading-room will be sup-
plied free with a copy mailed in envelope at MS. rateso as
to be “free from public observation.”

The latest suggestion in re the shearing
difficulty;—“Let the squatters cross their sheep
with carpet-snakes and get them to shed their
wool in season.”
Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Burney, Wallis & Co. report: No marked improve-
ment in the Sydney Wool market may be looked for until
result of opening of the London September series of
sales is knbwn, This week has been one of inactivity,
but next will see busy operations at our local auction
sales. A good forecast of the value of this season’s
clip may be taken from the result of the London opening,
ami we think it must be in the producers’ favour. We
have now almost daily to hand news of trade improve-
ment in England and on the Continent, and this, coupled
with the fact that American buyers are already on their
way to our city, must give an impetus to the Sydney wool
sales of the season upon the verge of which we now find
ourselves. Very large catalogues cannot yet be placed
before buyers owing to most clips being incomplete.
Rain in some parts, and shearing troubles in orhers, are
the chief causes of delay. We will hold our opening sales
early in October, when the full buying strength of the
world will be with us, and our constituents must, there-
fore, receive the best possible competition for the wool.
Sydney, 14th Sept., 1894.
The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Com-
pany, Limited, report : —Wool : The market remains,
more or h ss, in a state of expectancy, and the volume of
business transacted during the week has not been large.
Sellers are indisposid to part freely with their stocks
until something definite is known as to the actual condi-
tion of affairs in the manufacturing centres of Europe,
and are waiting to receive news of the opening of the
London wool-sales this week. Buyers, on the other hand,
have indicated a willingness to make commitments, and a
strong private inquiry has been witnessed. Prices show
no important all station and may be quoted firm. The
new dip is arriving more freely, and the condition of the
wools is, for the most part, satisfactory, the bulk of the
clip being apparently sound, well-grown and healthy.
The company will hold a sale of about 3000 bales of the
new season’s supply on October 8, and will, after that
date, continue their weekly auction sales on each Monday
throughout the season.
The N.S.W. solidarity M.’sP. put forward
two candidates for the Public Works Corrim it tee-
ship, the only paid committee of the House. It may
be remembered to the credit of the pioneer labor
Ms.P. that they voluntarily refused such pick-
ings when they had a much better chance of
getting men on the committee than those who
were such severe critics and ante-electoral
moralists.
Ed. Bulletin, — Sydney Mail’s Deniliquin
correspondent says, “A. Landale, of Wandook, is
expected to start shearing with free laborers.
Now, ever since Mr. Landale had Wandook he has
shorn under a verbal agreement, and we started
shearing here last Friday under that agreement—
.£l a hundred, in and out —without any trouble,
and the men engaged months previously.—Yours,
Constancy.
The New Order is dead. It was a Sydney
weekly started for the purpose of getting its
brother Bill into Parliament, and having got its
brother Bill in, or failed to get its other brother Bill
in, its mission ended with N.S.W. general election.
It is surprising that the several varieties of brother
Bill who got in made no effort to save its attenu-
ated existence. But, doubtless, they judged that
brother Bill out was a different being to Brother
Bill, M.P., and acted accordingly.
The most remarkable feature of the N.S.
Wales Parliamentary Public Works Committee
was the downfall of that energetic placeman,
O’Sulli van, the famous keystone of the Democratic
arch, who was badly left. The O’Sullivan now
explains that he didn’t want the billet, that he
wouldn’t have accepted it if elected, and that he
told his friends and supporters not to vote tor
him. In fact, if the O’Sullivan had been elected,
he would have been the most infuriated keystone
in all Australia.
Every Irish member of Q. Parliament
who has taken an active part in Home Rule
leagues voted like a machine for Coercion in
Queensland. Duffy, member for Bundaberg, was
especially prominent in collecting money for con-
gratulatory cablegrams to the Irish party in the
House of Commons ; and Willie O’Connell, mem-
ber for Musgrave, and another coercionist, is
nephew of the titled Maurice O’Connell, first
president of the Q. Legislative Council, and a
relative of the great Irish tribune.
Sleath, M.P., according to Sydney D.T.,
made, “for him,” a temperate speech on the
shearing difficulty. This implies a certain sense
of disappointment on the part of the D.T. Long
ago they had editorially settled it that Sleath was
a mixture of a pirate, a buccaneer and an insur-
rectionist. It is very annoying that he should
turn out to be able to make “on the whole, for
him, a temperate speech.” Probably this admis-
sion was wrung from the paper by the contrast
between the moderation of Sleath and the wild
insurrectionary ravings of the Upper House the
night before on the same subject.
Premier Patterson waves the last disinte-
grated remnant of his vaunted spire in the politi-
cal atmosphere and announces that there are
going to be no shearing-troubles in Victoria while
he is on top, Patterson isn’t going to allow any
shearing troubles, and he has ordered all dis-
satisfaction to be abolished, and disputes are
strictly prohibited. He has also instructed
that “everything shall be held in readiness’’
—the exact mature of the thing that is in
readiness is left to the imagination. The
Bulletin respectfully asks Patterson why he
makes an ass of himself in this manner. The
shearing-trouble hasn’t reached Victoria yet, and
the man who tries to advertise himself by shaking
his little fist at an absent danger is just the same
kind of hero as the one who stands in front of an
empty cannon and announces that he will die at
his post if necessary.
A N.S.W. strike chapter, price £3OO.
The P.U. engaged an English gentleman in Mel-
bourne to convey 54 free shearers from there to
Kilfera and other sheds beyond Booligal, N.S. W.
At Junee the E.G. chartered a special tram to
take them to Hay. Whilst changing trains three
free men became homesick and disappeared. Hay
was reached at midnight, where they were met by
400 wild unionists, all a-roaring and a-bellowing
like bulls. As they relieved the E.G. of his
revolver, they assured him of their undying love
for Lawnorder; they also mentioned that they
were loyal to the Queen. 20 free men succumbed
here to a severe attack of unionism and joined the
gang a-bellowing, &c.; the E.G. got the remainder
away in Cobb’s coaches. At 13-uiile Gate, whilst
changing horses, 12 more felt a feeling of aoTdarity
coming over them, and refused to go further. At
Booligal another vast horde of wild unionists
a-bellowing and a-roaring ; more Solidarity, with
the result that the. remaining 19 went over m a
body to the enemy. The E.G., to use his own
words, was left “all alone like a pelican in the
wilderness,” when five hairy persons, with their
pockets and shirts bulged out with unionist litera-
ture, insisted on his joining the union. The poor
English gentleman almost wept; and then the
hardened villains tried to give him in charge for
riotous behavior. Total cost of trip, £3OO.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The much-tipped and heavily-backed Nobleman
made a poor show in A. J.O. Derby. After fighting for his
head and pulling double from the start, he died away
when the straight was entered. At the distance the race
looked a one-horse show for Bonnie Scotland, hut Martin
Gallagher brought the unthought-of Chesterman with
such a rush that the pair were level a few strides from
home. Bonnie Scotland, however, battled it out bravely
and got his head in front on the post. Cobbitty was
third, some eight lengths away. Time, 2min. 44sec.
Albecore started favorite at 6 to 1 for Epsom
Handicap, at Randwick, on Saturday, but Volney, at 14
to 1, was as well backed as anything in the race. Volney
held it until passing the distance, when Uabba came with
a determined run, and passing Kelso’s gelding won by
half-a-length, Euroka running into a place. Mr. Dyke
must have had a nice win, as his colt was at 100’s to 3.
The manner in which Brockleigh won the
Spring Stakes showed him to be in great fettle. Once in
the home stretch, Paris and Brockleigh had the first set-
to, but Brockleigh soon dispersed of the pony’s preten-
tions, and then Ruenalf unavailingly put in his claim.
Paris ran third.
King Orry started favorite for the Trial Stakes,
but succumbed to the Caulfield Cup horse, Isaac, who
beat him without an effort, Blarneystone running third.

Throstle, a little-known filly, was good enough
to take the Doncaster St. Leger from colts that ran first
and second in the Derby. The autumn in England is so
clearly the season for mares that there is no excuse now
for the punter who lays odds upon a Leger colt as long as
one good-looking lady remains in the race. Probably
Throstle bad improved two stone between June and Sep-
tember, yet, knowing that these reversals of “form ” are
according to nature and precedent, the public accept
them as surprises when they come. Once more The
Bulletin wants to know why the female horse of Aus-
tralia is so consistently inferior to the male, and why she
so rarely shows a marked improvement upon her summer
form when the leaves begin to fall?

George Giffen was, after all, not so much to
blame, if rumor be true, in the trouble which caused him
to leave Norwood (S.A.) cricket-club, for which he hag
played for 14 years. Giffen is much incensed because the
club elected Blinman captain, and did not even put the
champion on the match-committee. Giffen’s secession
will, however, do much for Adelaide club cricket, as he
and Lyons will be indifferent teams.

The Essendon club having now won the Vic.
premiership four years in succession, it will be to their
own advantage to go off a bit next year, as their monoto-
nous success is killing all public interest in the game. A
couple of years back, when South Melbourne, Carlton,
Geelong, and a couple of other clubs all had a chance, a
crowd of 30,000 was nothing unusual, but now people
know the result is a foregone conclusion, and all but
Eisendon supporters stay away.

Essendon’s recent defeat by Geelong is evidently
due to Thurgood’s having failed to notch his usual
number of goals. “The demon” had one shot at about
39vds., bub failed to score. Added to this the Qeelongese
played it pretty low down on the visitors by kicking the
ball out of bounds into the crowd, who refused to return
it, thus delaving the play.

Next year Queensland has to make provision for
paying off £766,000 of the old 6 per cent, loan of 1870, and
£700,000 of 4 per cent. Treasury bills. Last time aQ.
loan of any magnitude fell due the province paid it by rush-
ing through, at the last moment, a new per cent, loan
at about 88—in ocher words, it made a dead loss of nearly
£300,000 on the transaction, with the soulful spectacle of
M'llwraith crawling on his bands and his vast
freckled knees to the British money-lender thrown
in. If the Nelson Government has any financial
capacity, it will start operations at least six months
in advance by offering 3£ per cent, interminable deben-
tures at par in exchange (or the old securities, thus
doing away witfi the big flotation expenses. A lot of
holders will doubtless accept, and, for the rest, Queens-
land may possibly manage to pay them off without.serious
loss, and if it can’t do that it may perhaps end by ex-
plaining to them that it is 3£ per cent or nothing. There
is £22,600 a year to be saved by converting into Si per
cents in this manner, and there is a big sum to be lost by
converting in the old “ heaven-born ” M'llwraithian style.

The London Times on Ananias, the auditor :
“Next to the great director swindle, the most cruel trick
practised on the poor is the auditor swindle. We have
recently had the repeated spectacle of men who call them-
selves chartered accountants avowing that their pre-
tended audit of accounts is nothing more than a
mechanical checking of entries, which does not in ihe
remotest manner touch the question of a company’s sol-
vency or honesty. Chartered accountants are persons
who hold their heads high. They have an institute,
fellowship of which is supposed by the public to be a
guarantee for thoroughness in the work of verifying a
balance-sheet. But the public cannot too speedily under-
stand that the fellowship conveys no assurance of the
kind, and that an auditor’s certificate is absolutely
worthless for any purpose that an investor need
consider. There may be, and probably are, audits
which really afford an independent corroboration
of the statements in a balance-sheet. But the public
have no means of knowing whether an audit means this
or merely a clerical comparison of a set of figures with
the published copy as them. Indeed, so long as auditors
are appointed by the persons they are supposed to check,
and have no independent power to investigate or disallow
improper transactions, it does not seem reasonable to
expect their work to be of any real value."
Tliis is exactly what The Bulletin has been
saying over and over again for years past. The auditor
simply guarantees that the balance-sheet is a full and fair
statement of the accounts as shown by the books. If the
books are right, then the balance-sheet is right; if the
books are wrong, then the balance-sheet is wrong also.
And as this is exactly how things would be if there
were no auditors, these gentlemen are *of very
little visible use to anyone except themselves.
Now and then, however, the auditor is so exceed-
ingly careful to state that he only guarantees the
balance-sheet to be a true statement of the affairs “ as
shown by the company’s books,” and so unusually par-
ticular to avoid all responsibility for anything that lies
outside the books, that the public gets a glimpse of the
fact that the books are hopelessly cronk, and that the
auditor is aware of the fact, and is carefully safeguarding
himself from the gaol which is to come. But it is only
when he begins to stand from under in this fashion that
the public learns anything. And even then it doesn't
learn much.

It is not always a good move to save your biz
from creditors by making it into a limited co. A certain
Northern printer hit on a literary “enterprise,” and after
a hard struggle made a fair success thereof. On a few of
Ids long-suffering creditors “tumbling” to the fact that
the typo was likely to strike oil at last they began to press
for *• a bit of the old." Whereupon the over-prudent one
promptly ran the concern into a limited liability co., in
which he gave a lot of literary men of straw fully-paid
shares, amounting in the aggregate to twice the number
held by himself. At the time he gave the shares away, a
lot of money was owed to the concern by agents, and
he himself purposely allowed the co. to run into his
debt some hundreds, so as to lend color to the genuine-
ness of the sale of the affair. The riff-raff who held
the majority of the shares had a high old time for a
few months or so, but the promoter-printer could not get
paid, and threatened to sue the co., who promptly called
a meeting and, by sheer force of votes, decided to raise
wages all round 100 per cent, so as to prevent a divi-
dend and dispense with the promoter’s services as a
printer. The devil of it is that the promoter is waiting
a certain certificate, and ,can, therefore, do nothing to
enforce his claims.

The greater part of the money for working the
diamond drill boring for coal at the Red Bluff, St. Kilda
(Melb.), is being found by a Spiritualistic lady of ample
fortune. A medium said the spooks told her there was
coal at the Bluff, and the fair one has backed the opinion
to the extent of some thousands. It keeps men employed,
at any rate, though no coal has yet been found.

A London financial paper is painfully surprised
at not hearing anything more about “the astonishing

that, owing to the wool season, freights to London have

Months back the writer read in an English
paper of the wonders in mining performed by Lord Percy
Douglas and the Hon. Carnegie, and a shaft 80ft. sunk,
and splendidly timbered by them unaided, was mentioned.
Since then the writer has seen the shaft, which is only 30ft.
deep and is not timbered at all, and, above all, he learned
that the noble lord and bis crew never got any farther
than the windlass.

shall be sent along by return post. The man who is
running the enterprise does his business by circular, as
follows: —
“Dear Sir,—Several important leases adjoining the
mine have been applied for.
The existing railway to passes through one of
the blocks.
I am forming the Company (No Liability), and
have allotted you one promoter’s share of £lO.
To cover expenses, such as deposit to Warden and
survey fees, the first and only levy of £1 is made, which
please remit by return post. The share will then be
issued fully paid up to £lO.
The above-mentioned expenses will not exceed £4O,
and the whole of the balance subscribed will go to the
credit of the company.—Yours faithfully.
This business ought to pay. The ohanoe of giving a
complete stranger 20s. for a £lO promoters' share with
his own sole assurance that several important leases have
been taken up somewhere or other, and with no informa-
tion as to who takes charge of the money, or whether
there are 40 or a million shares in the co., or what the
prospects of the mine amount to, or anything else, is a
Joy which comes to most men only onoe in a lifetime.

in England and erected at Coolgardie, will only cost

be £6OOO at Coolgardie. £lO,OOO a year out of a 20-head

It is said that there is in England no man
more conversant with British History than Lord
Rosebery, the present Prime Minister. This is as
it should be, for no man can hope to make future
history without the light of the past to guide
him. This applies equally to social economy and
to polities, for history ever repeats itself, and
there is one instance where 40 years of constant
and unrivalled success is sufficient guarantee for
another 40 years. It need hardly be said the allu-
sion is to Priddy, the high-class hatter, whose fame
is world-wide.
The Art Society of N.S. Wales, in place

works of art will be distributed, the first-prize
being a painting valued at .£lO5. Tickets can be
obtained from the manager at the society’s rooms,

out the city.
Dear Bulletin, — “P.H.’s”
distinction between “ muscle ”
and “sinew*’ is an imaginary
one, as far as function is con-
cerned. The sole source of
animal mechanical force is the
contractile power of the muscles
proper, the sheath portions of
which—modified into what is
called sinew or tendon—serve
merely to transmit the power
over joints and into extremities
the action of which would be
impeded by such fibrous masses
as are required to originate the
energy. To say that a sinewy
man (nervous conditions being
equal) is stronger than a mus-
cular one is to say that the rope
is stronger than the windlass !
Physios.
Dear Bulletin, —“ P.H.”
complains that I “imply that
great muscular development de-
notes strength. ” Certainly Ido;
but it is not a question of quan-
tity, but quality. A working
bullock in good condition is
stronger than a fat one of the
same weight. He is also smaller,
and his muscular tissue is harder
and tougher, as “P.H.’’ would
find if he tried to eat some of
him. A 12-stohe navvy looks
smaller and slighter than a man
of the same weight who lives a
sedentary life, because he has
much less fat mixed with his
muscular tissue, and, though his
muscles may not be so bulky,
they are harder. Sinews are
simply the attachments which
join the ends of the muscles to
the bones. Of course, large
bones, which are really the levers
of the animal machine, are
essential to strength; so are
large and strong tendons and
muscles, which represent the
ropes and bands of the machine.
By their contraction and extension they produce
motion.— Unt.

A STAMP MANIAC.
A stamp-collector advertised in Melbourne last
week that he was the possessor of a collection of
12,544 stamps, and wished to marry a lady who
was an ardent collector and the possessor of the
blue penny stamp of Mauritius, issued in 1847.
He received only one answer from a lady who
owned the coveted stamp; but, as a conditian to
her union with him, she required a proof that he
smoked nothing stronger than Frossard’s Cavour
Cigars, as every other kind affected her nerves,
and she stated that a man indulging in these mild
and fragrant weeds was giving such a sign of
sound judgment and economical habits that a
woman could safely trust herself to him. It must
be remarked here that Frossard’s Cavour Cigars
cost only Is. for a packet of 8, and, considering
the quality, this lady was quite correct in alluding
to their cheapness.
THE NEW TEA.
The vigorous and novel advertisements that have
been, and are still appearing, in the Sydney and
provincial papers, of “My Favorite” tea, have
opened the eyes of some to the possibilities of
advertising, and the very satisfactory report from
Messrs. D. Mitohell and Co., the enterprising
proprietors of this famous blend of tea, goes to
prove that, given a good article, backed up by
intelligent and liberal advertising, success is
pretty certain. It appears that about two years
ago Messrs. D. Mitchell and Co. plaoed on this
market a jam of surpassing quality, known as
“My Favorite ” jam. There were no end to the
different brands of jam then existing, and friends
of the firm prognosticated failure. Mr. Mitchell,
however, was determined to try the experiment,
and see whether a jam of the best possible quality
would not succeed when the inferior brands then
ruling were making, to use a nautical phrase,
“bad weather of it.’’ The almost phenomenal
gucoess of “My Favorite” jam led to a similar
experiment with “My Favorite” tea, and the
result, so far, has been beyond expectations. The
difficulty in getting good tea is well-known, but
it is a fact that few will oare to dispute, that when
onoe good tea is found its flavor varies and thereby
causes disappointment. The reason of this is
apparent; it is not that the quality is necessarily
lower in grade, but the blending is done by
those who are not experts at the business. Messrs.
D. Mitohell and Co. have in their employ experts
who not only blend the tea in the same proportion
but are also careful to blend teas ot the exact
quality and flavor required to produce what is now
known as “My Favorite ” Tea. There is no
doubt of the permanent success of this tea, for it is
most delicious in flavor and of exceptional quality
and strength. “My Favorite Tea ” is put up in
elegant air-tight tin caddies, got up to represent
japannedware, in lib., 51b., 101 b., 201 b. caddies
and half-cheats. It is sold throughout this pro-
vince by grooers and storekeepers, and is a per-
fectly pure, delicious and fragrant tea, and cer-
tain to be true to its striking name whenever it is
introduced into the home circle.*
HOW A LOT OF MONEY LEAKS OUT.
What does a man do when he finds a hole in th«
pocket where he carries his money ? Anybody
can answer that question. He has it sewed up, of
course, directly—and good and strong, too. I
suppose it is with you just as it is with me. When
I spend money, even foolishly, I oan tell where it
went, and maybe I’ve had some sort of pleasure
out of it. But Ido mortally hate to lose money;
lose it out and out, you know, and have no satis-
faction from it, or know how or when it left my
possession.
Well, now, let me show you the worst and biggest
hole any man ever had in his pocket; a hole
that lets the cash leak away like water through a
sieve, a hole that is the hardest in the world to
sew up. A short story will show it best.
“Drummore South Cottage,
“ Musselburgh, near Edinburgh,
“September 16th, 1891.
“ Gentlemen,—Up to 1885 I was always strong
and healthy. About this time I began to feel bad.
I was tired, languid, dull, and listless, and every-
thing was a burden to me. I had no desire for
company, and what had come over me I could not
make out. My tongue and mouth were dry, and
I had a deal of phlegm on my stomach. The
whites of my eyes next became discolored and my
skin was yellow. I had no appetite, and after
eating I had great pain at my chest and sides, also
across my stomach. After a time the pain settled
in mjr left side, and my heart would beat and
jump in a manner that alarmed me. By-and-by I
got so weak that I was not able to go about the
house, and I felt that I ought to be in bed. The
pains at my side and stomach became so bad that
I had to remove my clothing (everything seemed
so tight), and I used to press my stomach and
hold my sides to try and ease the pain. Getting
worse, I saw a doctor at Musselburgh, and was
under him for three months, but his medicine
gave me no relief. After this I went to a clever
doctor at Preston Pans who said I was suffering
from indigestion and dyspepsia. He sent to
London for some celebrated medicine which was
packed in small phials. This medicine seemed to
dissolve my food, and I felt easier for a time, but
I gained no strength or real benefit, and after per-
severing with his treatment for six months, I
gave it up and fell into my old state. I next
went to a doctor at Musselburgh, but all his
medicines did me no good. After this I saw
another doctor (that is a fourth doctor), but with
the same result; none of them gave me anything
that reached my complaint. I now lost all faith
in physic, for I had spent a deal of money and
taken so much medicine ‘ that I lost all my teeth
through it ’ and was no better for it. In great
misery I lingered on month after month, always
ailing, when in August of last year (1890), my
husband called at Mr. Jack’s Drug Stores, High-
street, Fisherrow, and told him what my condition
was. Mr. Jack gave him an account of the
wonderful cures he heard of from many of his
customers that had taken a medicine called
Seigel’s Syrup, and strongly recommended him to
bring me a bottle. He did so, and I commenced
taking the Syrup, and I found some relief from
the first bottle, and by the time I had taken four
bottles I was as well and strong as ever I was in
my life, and have since kept in good health. I tell
every one what Seigel’s Syrup has done for me.
* I never thought to get better again, and I con-
sider it has saved my life. I wish others to know
this, and if by publishing this statement it will be
the means of helping others, as it helped me, you
can use this letter as you like. Yours truly
(Signed) Jemima Watson.”
Look back to about the middle of the above
letter and again read what the writer says : “ I
had spent a deal of money for medicine.” Yes,
and money she could poorly afford to spare. Ill-
ness and the expense of illness is the great hole in
the pocket that I alluded to. It costs so much,
and what does it give us in return ? Pain, weari-
ness, and misery. There is another consideration
besides. When we are ill we not only have to
bear the increased outgo, but manage to meet
larger demands out of a decreased income. Our
candle is burning at both ends. “Yes,” you say,
“but how can we keep from falling ill ?” You
oannot always, but in view of the fact that most
illnesses arises from indigestion and dyspepsia, a
timely use of Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup will
prevent it. A few shillings thus invested will
save pounds in money and perhaps months of
wretchedness. Think over the striking points in
Mrs. Watson’s excellent letter and you will think
the same.

“No. 154.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
The fat Dutch sentry challenged. A mere
matter of form—for it was a number— and a
number cannot give a countersign. Nevertheless
“ 154 ” —huge red figures on a blue cotton blouse
—had the outward semblance of a big-boned man,
well-featured and not old, but wild-beast-eyed
and toil-oppressed. The soldier levelled at the
number’s head; the number nodded and stood
fast. “ I came for that,” it said, and the sentry,
gaping, dropped his rifle to the “ready.” His
orders were explicit. “You will fire instantly
upon any convict coming, unaccompanied by an
official, within 20 metres of your post.”
But here was a convict within bayonet-thrust.
Jan Ruycker had already broken the regulations;
but still, perplexed by want of precedent, he
hesitated to erase for ever this audacious number
at its own request. For compromise, he lowered
his bayonet to the “ charge.”
“Yes—that way, if you will! ” the convict said,
indifferently. “And here.” He laid a gaunt
forefinger on the upper angle of the “4” that
made the units of his only designation on Padak
Island. But the sentry had known him by
another; in Ruycker’s brain the precision of the
action condensed like magic a misty recollection.
He dropped, together, his jaw and his rifle-butt.
“My God !” he said —“ Dr. Van Kloon ! ”
On the sodden sand the tw o men stood, secluded
by the blinding rain that shut out all save here and
there the ghostly shadow of a cocoa-palm, and,
down at the end of the sandspit, the jetty fading
into the dreary mist that hung upon the sullen
sea.
Through this white wetness came a four-oared
boat, the rowers cooped—like monstrous blue-red
parrots—in an iron cage that stopped a few feet
short of stem and stern. In the bows a green-
coated warder nursed his rifle; a superior official
—his verdure relieved by silver-lace—sat aft and
steered.
The two men facing each other beside the sentry-
box saw nothing of the boat—heard nothing, till
the hollow thump of footsteps on the jetty made
them start —the soldier towards “attention” —the
convict like a bullock to the whip. Habit, this,
with both ; but the soldier’s plight, if thus caught
convict-parleying, was no whit better than the
convict’s own, and the sudden realisation of the
fact spurred Ruycker’s jog-trot wits into unwonted
gallop. He snatched at the convict’s coarse blue
sleeve. “ Behind the box !” he gasped.
The other shook his shoulders. “What use?”
he said. “The new sentry will put a bullet
through me, if you won’t.”
“ It’s not the relief, I tell you —it’s the civil-
controller.”
With a spring the convict was behind the box,
all but his head.
“ Zevenbergen ? ” he asked, with a savage glad-
ness in his face.
“ Ay! curse him! he’s always on the prowl.
Keep close I ” and Ruycker faced about and
challenged.
The new-comer answered, and came up till he
towered close above the sentry, for civil-controller
Zevenbergen was a very tall man, whose jolly red
face gave a most emphatic lie to his disposition.
“All well?” he asked, flinging back his long
green overcoat, and appearing to look everywhere
but at the sentry.
“ All well, sir 1 ”
“You lie, you Walloon scoundrel I 1 see it in
your mutton-face! ”
Now Private Jan Ruycker was no Walloon.
He was as good a Hollander as Zevenbergen, and
thus, when from behind the sentry-box a heavy
blue something hurled itself suddenly forth upon
the green official, the soldier’s anger held his hand
for a moment. But that moment was enough!
The convict’s iron-bound shoe had caught the
fallen controller tremendously twice beneath the
fat red jaw, and to all appearance it was hanging
for ever.
With a contented laugh the convict sat down
upon the wet sand. He had finished his tyrant!—
what mattered the rest ? But the soldier’s stimu-
lated mind embraced the situation in a flash. To
linger here was death —and, in any case, he was
weary of a lot but little easier than a convict’s.
He dragged the apathetic killer to his feet.
“ Rouse up !” he said. “ The boat’s below —let
us get away from hell!”
“From hell!” the other echoed, and was half-
way to the jetty before a sudden recollection
pulled him up. “ There are warders in her,” he
whispered. “Armed!”
The cold light of desperation came into the
soldier’s eyes as he changed the cartridge in his
wet rifle. “There’s only one,” he answered,
“ and ” —a slap on the breech said the rest.
Van Kloon thrust him backwards. “Not so.
No murder. That”—and be pointed—“was an
executionl Leave this to me.”
Beside the shell-encrusted piles the cage-boat
rose and fell, fended-off, through the bars, by the
four dejected wretches that watched with envious
eyes the glow of the warder’s cheroot. Malays
and murderers all —there wasn’t one of them who
wouldn’t cheerfully have slit the official’s wind-
pipe for the sake of that little roll of tobacco—the
knowledge of which fact but gave the weed a
keener zest to the hard-eyed man that peered
through the pallid mist for the coming of his
chief.
At last a form just shaped itself from out the
veil of vapour—stopped at that—waved above its
head a shadowy gun. This was curious! —and, as
the warder stood up to look, a long blue arm
swooped swiftly over the outer gunwale, caught
him by the ankle, and flung him heavily over
between boat and jetty. When he got his head
up again he found himself looking up the barrel
of his own rifle, and had no difficulty in under-
standing that for him the jetty was now much
healthier than the boat. Upon the steps the
soldier passed him with a curse—there was a jab-
bering of the caged convicts—a word or two from
Van Kloon —then straight out into the mist went
the boat, as fast as oars could drive her.
• • •
A certain five numbers, having levanted,
became for the nonce men again, with names and
histories —to be looked up in the prison-records,
and long did old Vander. Eyde twist his white
moustaches over an entry which set forth, in sub-
stance, that Julius Van Kloon, chemist and
native of Rotterdam, had on a certain date been
sentenced at Batavia to ten years’ imprisonment
for supplying, contrary to law, certain poisons to
an insurgent Javani chief.
The military-controller turned round to his
secretary. “ That was the Sidi business, wasn’t
it? Poisoned the water for our troops, the old
villain did ! But there’s something in the matter
that puts me in mind of the valuable colleague I
am about, alas I to lose.”
The ancient warrior’s face belied his tone, and
the secretary ventured on a decorous smile. “ The
connection is this, Excellency. Van Kloon was
convicted wholly on the evidence of his partner,
one Zevenbergen. ”
Colonel Van der Eyde banged his fist on the
desk. “ That’s it!—our esteemed controller’s son !
I remember there was a notion at the time that
Zevenbergen had a hand in it himself !”
The secretary looked discreetly to the doors and
windows. He knew —who better? —that prison-
officers are ex-officio eavesdroppers, and the civil-
controller might recover, after all. Then, with
bated breath, “ There are those who say still,
Excellency, that the job was wholly Zevenbergen’s;
and that his father knows it.”
The colonel, with a mighty military oath,
declared that he fully believed it, and that, if the
Government wanted to catch that poor devil of a
Van Kloon, the Government might do it, for he,
Van der Eyde, was essentially bedevilled if he’d
try.
* « •
The Javanese of Moodan were not yet
“ protected.” So little, indeed, were they in love
with the paternal Hollander that when, into one
of their coast villages there crawled a wretched
creature in a tattered uniform, the people would
have krissed him on the spot, but that close
behind him staggered other starvelings in another
livery they recognised. Prison-men had reached
the Moodan coast before—bitter enemies of the
Dutchman and his works —and this soldier, doubt-
less, was of their mind. So it was welcome,
instead of murder!
• « •
When at last, in the Batavian papers, it
was announced that the Moodanese had gone
under, it was mentioned with much flourishing of
trumpets that in the midst of this ferocious people
two hardy Hollanders had dwelt for years. “ Our
gallant troops,” quoth editorial rigmarole, “were
thunderstruck to receive in the heart of hostile
territory a welcome from these adventurous
pioneers !”
The “pioneers”—a run-away convict and a
deserter—kept their own counsel.

Rev. E. H. Scott, of Kangaroo Flat, Vic.,
writes to Melb. papers, in a mental perspiration,
affirming that local M.’sP. must be all that the
Rev, Edgar painted them, inasmuch as they are
responsible for the existing divorce-law, “a law
that legalises adultery, and teaches people to sin
under the shelter of legal enactment.” Yes, and
the blessed clergy are a very bad lot, in that they
teach people that they can have no end of a flighty
time here below, so long as they preserve their
presence of mind sufficiently to square up at the
eleventh hour.
H. H. Champion declares that Socialistic
progress all over the world has been retarded by
the woeful maladministration of the State’s under-
takings in Victoria. All things considered, it
will be as well for Victoria not to start a State
bank until the present ruling forces have become
extinct. And after then—what ? Mrs. Besant
telling her first Melbourne audience that the
national character of the future would be evolved
from the thoughts of to-day was in effect saying
that Victoria would go from bad to worse, for
there doesn’t seem to be a noble thought left in
the country.
Percy Chirnside, deah boy, as a candi-
date for Grant, is another of those who would
put Victoria straight with a “ wealth ’’-tax,
instead of an income-tax. His unselfish spirit
yearns for a halfpenny, or even a penny, tax on
all ratable property, on the distinct understanding
that it would remain in force for one year only.
With a little persuasion Percy might even be got
to approve of a graduated-tax, starting at three-
pence on very small properties and working down
to a farthing on the very large ones.
Premier Braddon writes to Premier Reid
that “local matters, financial and political, have
very fully of late occupied Australian statesmen.”
Braddon, Patterson, Reid, Nelson; take them
from south to north, and then study the title
“statesman.” Take them all round Australasia,
and study it. Parkes once said publicly that he
hated the word, and afterwards, qualifying his
expression (and no doubt thinking of_ himself),
said that only men of pre-eminent public services
were entitled to be so described, and that the
only place it looked well in was a memoir.
At an English Court, recently, a publican
was fined £25 for adulterating beer by “unlaw-
fully mixing 151 b. weight of sugar with 567 gals. of
wort and beer to increase the gravity.” The plea
that the sugar was thrown in to make the stuff
more palatable didn’t count worth the talking.
Australia takes its guzzle more recklessly. It is a
public suspicion, whether founded or unfounded,
that a lot of “colonial beer” is a semi-fermented
decoction of sugar and hops, quite innocent of
malt, and having “grains of paradise ” and other
cheap but poisonous bitters thrown in as luxuries.
Candidates for S.A. Parliament have now
to file an account of election expenses immediately
after the poll. In that of one of the Labor-candi-
dates at the recent elections appeared the name of
a bank clerk as a contributor of .£3. A prominent
squatter and ex-M.L.C. called on the bank-
manager and asked that the clerk should be
warned or punished. The manager had the pluck
to say that he would not interfere, and the
squatter then threatened to report him to head
office. The organ of the S.A. Ass openly advo-
cates that this clerk and others similarly placed
be taught a lesson, and no doubt he will suffer
sooner or later for daring to back Ins political
opinion.
On the night of the division in the Vic-
torian Assembly which stranded the Patterson
Ministry, Shiels, that man of dramatic entrances
and exits, made the most dramatic entrance of his
life. M'Lellan, on behalf of the Government,
was pointing out all the horrors that would come
if the voluble ex-premier were brought back to
office. “ When he does come,” said M.L., whirl-
ing his long arms round seventeen times or more
—“ When he does enter,” and the excited member
flapped his limbs desperately in the air, “ he will
enter like a destroying angel—like a destroying
angel, Mr. Speaker.” Then there was a yell of
laughter, for Shiels was just entering, with a
gentle, heavenly smile on his countenance, and
that mild, upward expression that betokens the
saint whose thoughts are fixed on things above.

Labor members are objectionable to the
Argus because they represent a class, and it
generously admits that “bankers returned to
represent bankers, and lawyers to represent law-
yers,” would be equally objectionable. But car-
penters do not go into Parliament to represent
carpenters only, nor bricklayers to represent brick-
layers. The avowed Labor member has a larger
clientele than the average banker M.P. who is
returned to represent a mass, but, all the same,
never by any chance represents other than the
narrow clique to which he belongs. He always
believes that he represents the people, but if you
watch him, you will find that he also believes he
represents the Almighty.

“Hamlet" at Bunyip Hill .
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Fifteen years ago Bunyip Hill was a lively
mining township. It had sprung up unexpectedly
in the leafy wilderness, immediately after the dis-
covery of rich alluvial on the flat and a good reef
in the hill. For about four years the place
revelled in prosperity, and every pocket was
heavy. Then yields began to slow down and local
public sentiment took a more sober tone. The
alluvial “cut out,” and the reefing drifted into
the hands of tributors. Every departing Cobb’s
coach took away a band of miners to seek fresh
fields and diggings new, little richer for all the
gold that had passed through their hands ; and at
last the township sank into stagnation and decay.
In its heyday, Bunyip Hill possessed a dramatic
club named “The Thespian Amusers,” but
facetiously reohristened “The Tub Thumpers”
or “The Thirsty Brigade.” The moving spirit,
business-manager, stage-carpenter, scene-painter,
costumier, and mechanic, was Mr. William Harper
—for convenience, “Glib Bill.” William had a taste
for the stage. At onetime in his early career he
had appeared successfully as the leading feature
of some mythological animal in a London panto-
mime, and subsequently he won honorable mention
from the Bungbong Express for his inimitable
rendering of the Chinese character-song, “ Hi,
yah, yah ; sing, sing, sing.”
Bill, in his clayey “ moles,” yellow flannel, and
water-tights, was manager and sole proprietor of
a puddling-machine down by the creek, which
concern he glorified with the title of “The Bunyip
Puddling Company, Limited.” The remainder of
the working staff of the Bunyip Puddling Com-
pany consisted of a tarnished small boy, who rode
round on the harrows, and a long-drawn, melan-
choly horse, the color of all concerned in the
undertaking—a dead yellow. But Mr. William
Harper, radiant after a clean shave and magnifi-
cent in a high hat, a paget coat, polished boots,
check pants, and a scarf-pin as big as a whip-
handle, was the manager and bright particular
star of the Thespian Amusers, and nothing smaller.
His compatriots observed the distinction, and Mr.
Harper was happy.
The Bunyip Hill dramatic club had made its
reputation in nigger-minstrel performances, the
distressing solemnity of which, combined with the
aggravation of an exceptionally hot summer, was
known to have driven several reputable residents
to drink and one to suicide—Taffy Davis having
gone direct from the hall on one memorable occa-
sion and drowned himself in the Hand in Hand
Co.’s dam. The colored minstrel is not an
exhilarating exhibition as a rule. Fixed tradi-
tions, decayed jokes, and a stereotyped double-
shuffle, combine with his funereal hue to make
him pall readily on the educated taste. The
Thespian Amusers were sad beyond the average.
They were about the worst collection of hands and
feet and diseased intellect that was ever permitted
to disturb the peace of a district by concerted
screaming and individual reaching after notes
elevated beyond human hopes, or to violate the
human understanding with antique gags, solos on
the bones, and various instrumental annoyances.
Despite all this, the men of Bunyip Hill coun-
tenanced the Thirsty Brigade, and refrained from
throwing offensive articles at the enthusiastic
band of amateurs. The forbearance of the miners
did not arise out of any appreciation of the per-
formers as artists, or any consideration for their
relations. But so many were beholden to the
amusers for “benefits,” and so few knew how
soon a fall of dirt or a slip in a “ jump up,” in
their own cases, might make one of those “ bene-
fits” very acceptable to their surviving friends by
relieving the widow of the expenses of burial, that
Harpei’s song and dance were accepted with
chastened resignation, and the united efforts of
the galaxy with Christian fortitude, relieved only
by an occasional oath and a timely resort to the
consolations of rum.
The Bunyip Hill dramatic club would play a
benefit on the slightest provocation—a local
broken leg or a famine in China ; a death in the
township, or an eviction in Ireland ; an accident
in a mine, or a slice of bad luck in salting a porker.
No excuse was too thin for those rude, uncultivated
mummers to break out in a variety entertainment
of awful proportions and unmitigated wicked-
ness, and every man held it a duty to attend and
immolate himself on the altar of friendship.
Mrs. Kelly, wife of the pitman at the Hand in
Hand, had a baby, and straightway a benefit was
tendered to the family. Twenty-four hours later
Mr. Ben. Mann, boss of a shift, was part-pro-
prietor of twins. The Thespian Amusers were
equal to the occasion—they tendered him two
benefits. Three days later it became known that
an unprecedented calamity had happened to the
township. Mrs. Stacey, whose husband’s claim
had panned out a mean average of four penny-
weights to the load for two months past, had
given birth to triplets. A benefit per head was
awarded to the stricken parents, at the conclusion
of which season Sam Goon had a cow smothered
in the slurry, and was rewarded with a per-
formance. Seven doses of the Thespian Amusers
within a fortnight was enough to unhinge in-
tellects and subvert all the finer attributes of the
animal man. An endeavor was made to obviate
the last night’s evil by obliterating all traces of
the deceased cow, and taking up a private collec-
tion to recompense Mr. Goon, but Harper
heard of the catastrophe, and Sam got the benefit
all the same.
The loss of a horse or the death of a resident
were equally sad calamities on Bunyip Hill. Con-
siderable anxiety began to manifest itself that
people and domestic animals should not die about
the township, but, had that consummation been
attainable, it would never have tempered the zeal
of Harper’s gifted society. In a world full of woe
they would iiave found reason for more. They
once gave a performance for the alleviation of the
condition of the sufferers by the plagues of Egypt,
and only permitted the profits to be diverted to
the improvement of the local cemetery on being
convinced of the antiquity of the Egyptian
incident.
Nobody ever understood what species of mental
aberration induced Manager Harper to put on
Hamlet.” When the announcement went out it
created a profound sensation, and several gentle-
mi’n immediately left the township to spend a
we 1< or two with sick aunts in the metropolis.
Die cast for the legitimate drama contained all
the names of the gentlemen with a parochial repu-
tiou for presenting a pronounced appearance of
“* n( K feet, and diffidence in blackened characters.
Miss Rosabella Jones, the favorite singer of senti-
mental ditties, was billed as Ophelia, and Mrs.
Rowland Lewis consented to appear for the first
time on any stage as Gertrude, Queen of Den-
mark.
A large audience awaited the players on the
night appointed for the initial production of
Shakespeare’s great play at Lang’s Temperance
Hall. All the youth and beauty and fashion of
Bunyip Hill paid at the gate, and the toilers and
moilers crowded the remaining space in painful
anticipation of something great in the way of
chaste entertainment. There is a stage in tragical
incapacity that is infinitely more amusing than
deliberate extravaganza. The gentlemen of
Bunyip Hill did not expect too much of the local
talent—they were content to be edified by its
defects.
Proceedings begfan at the specified time; the
orchestra took his place at the borrowed har-
monium, and, having played a preliminary canter
in the shape of the “Old Hundredth” on that
cheerful instrument, subsided as the curtain
rolled up, disclosing the platform before the castle,
and Francisco and Bernardo armed with revolvers
and attired in costumes which recalled about
equally the dress of a bullock-puncher and that of
a Spanish brigand. Horatio came on eventually,
wearing a paper collar and trailing an old army
sabre; he had on, in addition, knickerbockers and
stockings, a tucked-in jumper, and a Scotch cap
ornamented with a turkey’s feather. The student
Horatio was impersonated by Matty Clark, dis-
agreeably known to the public as the singer of a
lamentable dirge about “Molly, ochone, th’
loight uv me loife.” Matty was a faceman and
had brought from Cork a brogue unexcelled for
richness. This brogue fitted Matty, but it seemed
out of place in Horatio. However, the Bunyip
Hill audience was nob hypercritical, and Matty
was an immense success. He convulsed the house
every time he stepped up to pass a remark, and
his encounter with the ghost of Hamlet’s father
was the occasion of the wildest demonstration of
hysterical enthusiasm ever provoked on Bunjdp
Hill. For this, however, the spirit was partly
accountable. Stacey, the butcher, theatrically
known as Boss Eye, was put up to play the regal
spectre; and when the “majesty of buried Denmark”
rolled on, robed in a tablecloth that had done its
week and was garnished with greasy stains and
frescoed with boiled egg and brands of jam, the
audience just gripped itself and sat still, hard
held, determined to do justice to the gravity of
the situation or rupture a blood-vessel in the
struggle. Boss Eye was the weightest man on the
camp, and the thick end of his adiposity had
settled in his vest; but he made a conscientious
endeavor to look sepulchral, and sympathy was
with him. Hamlet’s father lurched abruptly into
the centre of the stage, brought himself up short
with a tremendous effort, then stood swaying
gently in a limp attitude, and regarding the audi-
ence with a large, inflamed and enquiring eye.
After a vain effort to strengthen his position and
recall the occasion of his arrival, he turned a bland
smile on the crowd, and awaited events,
Fwat are yez thet usurp’st th’ toirae av night,
T’gither wid that fair an’ warr-loike forum?
said Horatio.
This seemed to remind the spectre that some-
thing was expected of him, and he backed up
against the castle, struck a half-tragic, half-
collapsed attitude, waved his gilded broomstick
and cried—
“ Hamlet! sha, ole feller ! (hie !) Hamlet, I
am ” (hie!) Then he paused, assumed a con-
templative face and scratched his ear—he had
forgotten what he has.
“ Hamlet, I am shi” (hie whup!)
Again he paused to ponder. Frantic whispers
were heard from the wings, calling him off; dire
threats, coupled with local profanity to lend them
strength, were wafted over the slush-lamp foot-
lights ; but the ghost didn’t care a hang, he broke
out again ;
“ Hamlesh, I am !”
“ Come off, you infernal ass !” gasped Harper,
from “ behind.” “ It ain’t time for that!”
“ Oh, hie ! ” said the spectre, easting a con-
temptous look into the wings,
“ Hamlesh, I am—l (hie!) am —washa blazes am
I, Hamlesh ?”
“Ye’re a bloinded idjot!” hissed Horatio,
closing with the ghost, with the intention of lead-
ing him off. But a 16-stone ghost is not easily
portable. The resurrected Dane rolled heavily,
grasped at the atmosphere in an agony of appre-
hension, and came down with a crash like a col-
lapsed house, fetching away the castle of Elsinore
and numerous other fixtures in his overthrow, while
the curtain fell on the first scene amidst sqrearasof
delirious merriment.
In the next scene Hamlet appeared. Harper
impersonated the melancholy Dane, in a pair of
runner’s tights, with screens of purple and yellow.
He also wore a pair of patent-leather dancing-
pumps, a blue cape, and a Tam o’ Shanter hat,
with a scarlet plume ; and the long, tangled locks
of a rich, brick-dust wig fell in regal profusion
about his shoulders. Old Jones, the manager of
the North Star, appeared as Polonius, in a Druid’s
regalia; Jack Brown, the braceman, officiated as the
King ; and Laertes, Osric, Rosencrantz, Guilden-
stern, and the rest, were ambitious truckers from
the Hand-in-Hand, all caparisoned according to
the dictates of their own consciences and the
limited resources of the Thespian Amusers’ ward-
robe.
No show half so humorous ever lit up the dreary
realms of farce or pantomime. The audience was
convulsed from post to finish; shrieks of dis-
tracted laughter filled the house and flowed over
the town. People who had failed to secure seats,
attracted by the unwonted sounds of revelry,
besieged the windows, and “ Hamlet, Prince of
Denmark,” was voted a great success. It did not
take long to detect the fact that, barring the
ladies, the full strength of the company was, like
the regal apparition, considerably influenced by
divine afflatus imported in bottles. Hamlet’s
lugubrious gloom intensified with every scene, but
his princely bearing was modified in a like pro-
portion ; and, as the night wore on, his centre of
gravity became extremely erratic. The Ghost
would persist in discarding Shakespeare and tell-
ing his story in his own way. He had to be
shoved on, with his shroud turned twice round
his neck and hanging down his back, and he was
propped up from behind with a stick. The burden
of his lay was : “ I am she (hie!) father’s shpirit!
Come outen have a drink.”. Boss Eye made the
most convivial kind of a spirit, and the fact that
he had not slavishly followed stage traditions
endeared him to the audience. He was called
before the curtain at the close of the act with
encouraging enthusiasm. The cheerful apparition
scrambled out in response to the call, and balanced
himself before the audience, nursing a black bottle
with kingly dignity. When the applause had
subsided, he waved his hand in grateful recogni-
tion, and fell into the orchestra. Throughout the
remainder of the performance the ghost of Ham-
let’s father persisted in wandering on during the
progress of effective scenes, and proffering spiritual
solace from his black bottle to the melancholy
Dane. He spoiled several intense situations by
falling on them, and maiming the performers with
his solid adiposity. Hamlet had no sooner worked
himself up to a pitch of righteous indignation
about things in general than the weighty shade of
his deceased parent would drift on, collide against
him like a staggered camel, explode with a double-
barrelled, back-action hiccup, and then endeavor
to mend matters by inviting the Prince to take a
drink. Then Hamlet had to delay the perform-
ance whilst he hauled the Ghost away, and the
audience could hear him beseeching somebody,
with earnest eloquence and heartfelt profanity, to
sit on the spectre whilst he got on with the play.
After that the goblin would be anchored under
something for a time, but only to float on again
and disturb the gravity of a touching tableau.
The fact was the Thespian Amusers were the
victims of a callous and vulgar joke. Gravity
Brown, the billiard-marker at the Royal Mail
Hotel, and several other conspirators, had intro-
duced themselves behind the scenes, under the
plea of giving their assistance. They had primed
the Ghost before the commencement of the play,
and they kept liquor invitingly handy, and
seduced the cast of “Hamlet” to give way to
alcoholic beverages on every occasion. The Bun-
yip Hill dramatic club had not been nick-
named the “Thirsty Brigade” for nothing;
they required very little pressing, and the
conspirators were easily triumphant. It was
manifestly this plot that led to Harper’s
unprecedented reading of the scene with Ophelia
in the third act. After advising the heroine to
“ get to a nunnery,” Hamlet introduced an
original sensation by rapturously embracing the
lady and kissing her lips in an energetic and appre-
ciative manner. This prompted the affianced of
Miss Rosabella Jones, who was in the audience,
to rise up in open revolt. He elevated himself in
his place with every demonstration of excitement,
and brandishing a fist like a knot on a log, yelled,
“ Look here, that’s enough, Harper ! I’ll swell
your head !”
Hamlet did not heed the admonition ; he
sampled the damsel again.
“ Come homo, Bella Jones !” screamed the lover;
“ I’ll smash you for this, Harper !”
“If thou wilt needs marry,” roared Hamlet,
“ marry a fool.”
This was too much for the lover; he thought the
Dane was getting personal, and scrambled for that
melancholy individual, and presently Hamlet and
the young man were fighting to a finish in the
regal halls of Denmark; They raged round for
seven minutes, and then retired fighting.
Ophelia had to be dispensed with for the re-
mainder of the play, and when Hamlet came on
again he wore a black eye that ill befitted his
exalted position.
Shortly after this the machinations of the con-
spirators “ behind ” attained unrestricted play,
and the players strayed across the scenery bearing
debasing labels which read ; “This is Hamlet” —
or Horatio, or Laertes, or Polonius, as the case
might be, Claudius, King of Denmark, appeared
with a blackened face, wearing a ’possum-rug and
a brass crescent setting forth that the bearer was
King Billy, of the Burrumbeet tribe. Horatio
would persist in singing his favorite dirge,
“Molly, ochone, th’ loight uv me loife,” during
the progress of the “ chamber” scene, and Laertes
returned prematurely from France to dance a jig
on an inverted churn.
The interval between acts three and four was so
protracted that the audience began to despair of
further education in the subtleties of the immortal
bard. At length, however, when curiosity had
been strained to a dangerous pitch, the curtain
beeran to ascend. Very slowly it rolled, and the
excited spectators arose with it. Presently the
joke struck home, and the audience gave way to
its feelings, and did justice to the occasion with a
roar that brought down rain. The rising curtain
had disclosed the grave-yard scene, and the full
strength of the company (always excepting the
ladies) was discovered spread over the grave-yard
in artless abandon, all drunk, and all sunk in
slumber. Gravity Brown walked on to the stage,
and regretted to inform the audience that a slight
indisposition which had attacked the company
compelled the management to postpone the re-
mainder of the play till the Thespian Amusers
could be persuaded to take the pledge.
“Hamlet” was never concluded on Bunyip
Hill. Harper could not be persuaded again to
lead his company along the higher walks of the
profession, and nigger-minstrel business preyed on
the intelligence of the neighborhood till the bitter
end.

Wasted Money.
Ifc is simply wonderful in an enlightened age like
the present, how people will waste their money on
useless medicines. There are thousands of suf-
ferers in this country from liver torpidity, indiges-
tion, kidney complaint, and biliousness, who pay
half-crowns for so-called “cures,” when they
could get far better and safer results from half an
ounce of Epsom salts, costing one half-penny. Of
course, we know this chemical will not give per-
manent results—neither will many of the adver-
tised nostrums —but it will give temporary relief
and not injure the system, whereas the disguised
drastic purging mixtures sold by many quacks
will cause many serious diseases. Clements Tonic
does not cure or relieve disease by purging. It is
a natural tonic restorative, and acts by stimulat-
ing the digestive and secretive apparata to perform
their proper functions. It rebuilds wasted nerve,
bone and muscular tissue, restores strength to the
debilitated system, excites and permanently
strengthens the power of concupescence, and en-
sures a long, happy and enjoyable life, as proved
by the experience of Mr. Ernest Edward Feah,
Berry, N.S.W., who writes on April Bth, 1893
I am only too happy to give you a testimony re
Clements Tonic. I had a severe attack of influenza
nearly two years ago. I had the attendance of a
medical man from whom I derived no benefit. The
symptoms from which I suffered were severe
headaches, sore throat; I was unable to retain
anything I had taken on my stomach. My atten-
tion was drawn to one of your books, and after I
had taken three bottles of Clements Tonic 1
found great relief from that time until now.
When I feel unwell, I always take Clements Tonic
and no other. I wish anyone suffering from the
above symptoms would do the same ; I believe it is
the best medicine in the world. As far as I am
concerned, it cured me when all others failed.—
Yours truly, Ernest Edward Feah, Berry, N.S.W.
Camels at Coolgurdie.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Fez Mahomet is the camel-man of Coolgardie;
he is also the camel-man of the Murchison ; he is
said to still be the camel-man of Bourke and of
South Australia. There seems to be no limit to
his camel carrying-operations. He is said to have
taken 20,000 sovereigns to Westralia; he has cer-
tainly taken thither upwards of 2000 camels.
More than half of these are employed on the
Coolgardie goldfield. His camel-staff is believed
to consist chiefly of brothers-in-law ; many wives,
many brothers-in-law. It is not probable that
Fez has as many wives as camels ; if he is a much
over-married man his looks belie him. One of his
brothers-in-law claims to be champion wrestler of
Westralia. He is a stalwart Afghan who dresses
in spotless white, even at Coolgardie. No one has
yet thrown him, though many have tried; it is
believed he could throw a camel. On my way
back I met a champion wrestler from Victoria
who was going to Coolgardie to tackle Fez’s cele-
brated wrestling brother-in-law; but as no news
of the Victorian champion’s death has arrived in
the East the match cannot have come off. The
Afghan is bigger than Donald Dinnie, and has a
back like John L. Sullivan’s.
• # •
Afghans at Coolgardie are an exclusive section of
the community. They mix not with whites, and
are encamped outside the town. They never
trouble man or beast, but leave their' camels for
that business. Law prevents their dry-blowing
or working quartz-reefs, but even if the statute
were repealed to-morrow there would be no mad
Afghan rush. Fez and his minions allow the
homogeneous white man to find the gold, and then
they gather it in by other means.
• • •
The Afghans’ detestation of pork exceeds even
that of the children of Israel, They will not carry
pig-meat for any consideration. They will eat
no flesh which they have not killed themselves;
therefore they eschew tinned meats and live
principally on rice. The Afghan only asks for
meat when he has a white-man boss. To carry
live sheep is an expensive encumbrance ; therefore, t
Fez Mahomet has a monopoly of Afghan cheap
labour.
• # #
Heretofore, throughout Australia, Afghans
have been regarded as inseparable from the
camel as is the hump itself. This is a mistake,
and the hump is a nuisance. To protect the
hump the Oriental people have for centuries used
a saddle weighing from 70 to lOOlbs. The hump
is the softest part of a camel’s anatomy, but you
can’t load him anywhere else. That’s where all
the fat is. Camels, when without food or water,
live on their hump, and when you see a camel
with his hump considerably reduced you may
infer that he has had hard experience. It is time
the camel enigma were solved. Why not load his
neck, where lots of room and strength seem to
waste? His six to eight feet of able-bodied neck
might be used for carrying rolls of canvas, or
other softgoods,. which might be so placed as to be
run off by means of a windlass. This ship of the
desert might surely be better trimmed and bal-
lasted. However, this is a purely amateur idea.
• • * •
The Australian destiny of the camel is in the
shafts. Explorer Lindsay has several camel-teams
drawing goods, and they work “ like bullocks.”
They require a small collar with rope traces and
very little other harness. It takes time and
patience to break them in. They or their forbears
have not been brought up to the business, but
they will, I am pretty sure, be taught it in Wes-
tralia. I saw two in a buggy, where they looked
more grotesque than picturesque. Returning
from the 90-mile one bright moonlight night I met
two of Lindsay’s loaded camel-teams, eight and
six. I had never previously seen a camel-team,
and as they came on me suddenly in a bend of the
road I got my life’s biggest scare. But my horses
turned not a hair; they had seen them before.
Within the next 12 months there will be hundreds
of camel-teams in Westralia. To use back-laden
camels means unloading every night and re-loading
every morning, and neither is done in an instant.
The camel only carries an average of sowt., while
he can pull about half-a-ton. I saw six drawing
four tons over a sand-plain xvith the greatest ease.
I saw hundreds with sore backs, and sore-backed
camels have to be turned out for a spell. I never
saw one in a team with sore shoulders. The Wes-
tralian roads are bad in places, but they are in-
variably level, and, for unformed tracks, are excep-
tionally good.
« * •
The most highly-respected camel of Coolgardie is
Misery. Misery’s early career is lost in the mists
of antiquity. Some 40 years back he was im-
ported into South Australia, and having served his
purpose in laying the foundations qf Australian
camel-industry—his offspring outnumber Maho-
met’s brother S-in-law—he went into the carrying
business. Two years ago he was shipped Out to
Coolgardie, where he became the favourite riding-
camel of Warden Finnerty. He is at least as old
as Parkes, and while he lacks the cunning and
shrewdness of that statesman, he carries much
more weight in the community in which he lives.
If anything, Parkes has a keener eye to the main
chance, but is not so phlegmatic. Parkes is moved
by the force of public opinion ; Misery is absolute
adamant.
• * •
All camels are imperturbable. To attempt to
frighten a camel is to labor in vain. He has no
nervous system. A 100-ton gun-report would not
turn a camel’s hair. They are, it would seem,
absolutely destitute of sympathy or affection.
You could, possibly, by trying hard, make a pet
of a camel, but he never would reciprocate. He
is a smileless beast. A cow-camel will, however,
fondle its calf. I have seen cows lie down and

The Afghan, however, does not allow the cow to
fool away time with her youngster in business
hours. Within a few hours of the birth of the
calf I have seen Afghans load the mother with
several cwt., place the baby on top, and move off as
if nothing of moment had happened. A train of 50
camels cannot be delayed by any business of
that kind. After the third day the mother is
relieved of the calf, which runs alongside the train
and gambols with other small-fry, if there are any.
My ambition is to bring a sixty-days-old camel-

All camels are “ roarers.” Their groan is worse
than their bite. They groan most when loading,
and the groaning of 100 camels would almost be
tuo much for the inhabitants of a cemetery,
Camel-trains are made up of various lengths,
Some are nearly a-quarter-of-a-mile long, com-
prising 70 to 80 camels, with a clothes-line running
through their noses, in which studs like an over-
coat-button are fastened. A quick-walking camel
is placed at the head of the string to make the
pace. Sometimes the drivers ride; generally they
walk. The regulation pace is three miles an hour,
and it seldom varies. Time is kept as regularly as
with locomotives. When loading or discharging
cargo the camels drop down together, at the
ejaculation “ Hushla 1” and, when required, rise,
not together, but one after the other in regulation
turn. They drop into line with the precision of
soldiers. When a week without water, a camel is
limp and baggy. After drinking, he is like a
balloon.
* * *
The Australian-bred camel is said to be far
far better in this country than others-Indian or
Arabian-as a weight-carrier or for endurance. He
is bred chiefly at Hergot Springs, S. A., and most
of him is produced on the estates of squatter
Klder, who has sent 1200 to Westralia during the
’ast two years. Camel-farming has now been
tarted at Coolgardie. If a camel is brought
up where there is an abundance of water it will
drink every day, and in after-years would probably
die of thirst in a week. Hence the custom is to
breed them in paddocks without water, and from
their youth up they are allowed to drink but once
a week. This expands the stomach and enables
a big lasting supply to be taken in—a wrinkle in
camel-breeding worth knowing by amateurs. I
have seen a camel drink at the Government well
after being 17 days without water ; he quenched
his magnificent thirst with 30 gallons, containing
altogether a stone or so of salt and other ingre-
dients, such as gypsum, magnesia, and soon, which
no other stomach would stand. A friend of mine
lost his camel in a waterless bush for 23 days, and
the time that beast occupied in drinking at the
well satisfied me that no one had “ shouted ” for
him during that period. The Coolgardie salt
water is a little too much tor even camels. They
don’t fatten on it. They take it in the absence of
fresh, and because it is Hobson’s choice. But they
don’t like it; rather it doesn’t like them. There
is a palpable and painful distinction between
Afghans’ camels, which get nothing else but bore-
water, and those whose owners give them fresh
water. There is a limit to the drinking-capacity
of a camel. Like the Afghan, he won’t drink
whisky, and he would want to be very thirsty to
drink a barrel of “colonial” beer. He enjoys
a “ shandygaff,” which, being interpreted at Cool-
gardie, is a mixture of saltwater and condensed
water* But I would like to know what a camel
wouldn’t eat. He would eat a bush-house in a
meal. He is omnivorous. He eats “blind.”
As a camel-train moves along the track the
beasts stretch out their necks and take in
everything without discrimination— pine-scrub, if
it happens to be there—if not, anything that is;
saltbush, salmon, blue, white, gimlet, or any
other gum-leaves, currajong, sandal-wood—any-
thing, everything—nothing escapes his grinders,
If you like to give him chaff and oats that
is your business ; he will eat them, but he will
fatten just as well on brushwood, which does not
look to contain an ounce of nutriment to the ton.
Nothing grows that he will not eat—even poison-
plants don’t trouble him.

Camels are the personification of docility. Men
who have never seen them before have loaded
them at Esperanoe Bay, Albany, and Perth, and
marched away with them without the slightest
trouble. But it must not be considered that the
camel is incapable of mischief; he, as a rule,
simply doesn’t consider it worth while to exercise
his illimitable powers in that direction. He could
kick like a mule, with a five-horse-power kick, if
he liked, and he is much longer in the reach than
either horse or ass. He has a mouth large enough
to take in a man’s head, and his neck is long
enough to reach for you even if riding over his
stumpy tail. That he is capable of infinite buck-
jumping I had an opportunity of witnessing,
David Lindsay bought, or borrowed, a riding-
camel from Fez, and mounted him in Bayley-st.,
Coolgardie. To the amazement of the rider, and
the amusement of the crowd, a camel buck-
jumping show ensued. Never shall I forget it—
nor will Lindsay. For the first lOsec. the camel
skirmished sideways, then he ran his neck along
the ground and walked on his fore-legs, carrying
his hind-legs above him, and sculled the air with
them making what a Sydney News reporter
would call “ a long, clean, sweeping stroke. No
discredit to Lindsay that he was spilt. It was a
wonder to me that the camel did not buck his
hump off as well. 1 he danger of a camel-fall is
the heighfrof the brute. You are nine feet above
the ground to start with, and if you come off in
pne of his sudden back-arch movements you are
hftsd up another nine, and have a total drop of 18
eeb > which is too much for a heavy-weight. A
camel-race occurred last Queen s Birthday at Oool-
gafdl^’ l a . ® oor V, aft , er tb P * a . looked
» dead bird for Fez’s unbacked brute. The Eng-
s camels carried all the money, and true
*> *e instincts of British Fair Play, a number of
headed the leading camel and shouted
Hushla. Down he dropped in an instant,
gba ° s ros - e fco V l ®, occasion Wlt d saplings,
Off he went again and down once more at a re-
peaked Hushla, and down also came the saplings
°“ back. At last he won by a long neck, and
the Britishers went down for their money Good-
conditioned camels are worth at Coolgardie,
or -880 each a broken-kneed, sore-ba,cked beast
can be bought for £3O, while a first-class riding-
camel fetches <£l2o, and is well-worth it, for he
will carry you a hundred miles a day for a week
without a drink.
# * *
A camel, in his road-gait, rises in four distinct
motions, two aft and two for’ard ; and sometimes
he starts at one end and occasionally at the other,
so if you don’t watch him closely in the saddle
when rising you run the risk of breaking your
neck by a backward movement or dislocating your
back with a forward motion. The first ride on a
camel will fix up any bad liver, but completely dis-
organ iso all other internal arrangements. Easy
stages are recommended at first. A good
riding-camel will travel eight miles an hour
all day—a long swinging, ambling gait, with-
out variation: he will either walk at three
miles an hour or amble at eight, he has no
middle pace. Never tether a camel at night,
as most amateurs do. Close-hobble him and
let him loose —that is the right thing to do.
Sometimes they will travel a mile or two during
the night, especially if single, but when in com-
pany they are usually found together within a
short distance of camp. All wear bells, but some
are so cunning that they will carry their bells
when mustering-time arrives without ringing
them. Camels love each other’s society, and I often
found them grazing on salt-bush with horses for
the sake of company. Cow-camels never come
into season—that depends upon the nature of the
bull alone —a fact, as well as many others stated
above, probably unknown to nineteen-twentieths
of Australians.
# » *
If I wanted to lay Sydney in ruins I would use
camels in preference to dynamite. I would land
thirty six camels at Circular Quay, and start them
start them out in single file, carrying pianos and
boiler-plates; turn into George-street at twelve to
one o’clock on a fine Saturday and march to the
railway-station. I would get there; but long
before I reached Redfern the big city shops would
be full of ’buses and cabs and horses with broken
legs. Also, the coroner would have about 200
inquests fixed for next day.
OLD BENDIGO.
A very large number of Darlinghursfc
prisoners learn shorthand. The march of crime is
towards the press.
Melbourne Argus, which is running Free-
trade for all it is worth, lately demonstrated that,
on the machinery required for the equipment of a
single butter-factory, no less than .£447 had to be
paid in Customs duties. It not only asserted this,
but proved it by bard, unimpeachable figures.
It now transpires that the whole machinery for a
butter-factory only costs about £360 delivered,
duty and all, so the unimpeachable figures must
be lying again. The Freetrader can always prove,
by the most irrefutable logic, that Protection
makes things dearer —that it must make things
dearer, and can’t possibly do otherwise. But
somehow —no one seems to know how —things
don’t get dearer, all the same.
Melbourne bosh :
The sentiment of Freetrade seemed to have its personi-
fication in the noblest type of man—the unselfish man.
If so, importers, shipowners, squatters, stock-
brokers, agents and middlemen, and barnacles
generally—who form the bulk of Freetraders,
along with the slave who ‘‘thanks God and his
employer ” for being allowed to starve himself in
return for hard work—are “ unselfish men.” The
truly unselfish man does not exist. As “ self-
preservation is the first law of nature,” so self-
interest is the second. Love and ambition are
ruled by it. Nations rise and decline according
to its success or failure. The whole realm of
nature, zoological and inanimate, writhes with
selfishness. The almost-unselfish man ends always
as a wreck, a scouted failure, trodden down by his
enemies and contemned by his friends. But the
Freetrader? He is a freebooter —a wolf for
selfishness.
When You Tighten Up Your Belt.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
When you take to smoking gum-leaves as a substi-
tute for weed,
When you’d swap your hopes of glory for a good
old-fashioned feed,
When you feel like John the Baptist on his locusts
must have felt,
Then your sentiments get sultry as you tighten up
your belt.
When your boots are worn with walking till your
toes are on the ground,
When you ask for “ five-and-twenty ” and the
squatter says “a pound,”
You consign him to a region where he’d very
quickly melt—
You re-hoist your tattered bluey and you tighten
up your belt.
When the ration-bags are empty and the fish
refuse to bite,
And you seek your dismal shelter to endure a
hungry night;
When the wind begins to bluster and the rain
begins to pelt,
Then you curse the land that bred you as you
tighten up your belt.
Next you scramble up a sapling with a deluge all
around,
And you wonder when its over if your carcase
will be found.
Oh, the words to paint your feelings are with
difficulty spelt—
The recording angel’s busy as you tighten up your
belt.
And so the play goes onward, and you act your
lonely part
With a gnawing in your stomach and with murder
in your heart —
You’re a danger to the country be you Saxon,
Gaul or Celt,
And I think you’re well worth watching as you
tighten up your belt.
Queensland.
CURLEW.
When our old-time friend, Mrs. Gordon
Baillie, made her last appearance in the dock, she
addressed herself strongly to the poetic aspect of
the case. She was still very lovely, and she sat
tearfully in a beautiful attitude of resignation,
wiping her large, pathetic eyes with a lace hand-
kerchief, and looking appealingly at the jury.
She had a charming and soulful young lawyer
with the finest hair-parting in the profession, and
he talked in broken accents about the world’s
inhumanity to woman when she has made one
false step. If a jury of poets, artists, and hair-
dressers’ assistants could have been arranged for,
the lady would have got off, but the twelve men in
the box were mostly shopkeepers who had all been
taken in, at some time or other, by the same soul-
ful kind of defendant, and the result was seven
years.

“ The volume takes its name from one of the sketches, ‘ The Last of Six,’ though in point of merit they all stand pretty well on a. «• ar. The
author, who is familiar with life in Northern Queensland, writes with vigour about the doings of the Whites and the natives in these fa away
parts. A strong vein of mysticism runs through his narratives, and there are ghosts in almost every chapter, and for those who arc fond of
realistic work the volume will prove attractive reading.”— S.M. Herald, July 8, 1893.
“ No writer has given the world a more vivid description of Australia and its wilderness than Ernest Favenc, and the secret of tips is that
he has, by many years’ experience of travel and bush life, acquired a knowledge of this continent which is possessed by scarcely any other writer.
He, too, possesses great descriptive powers. Whatever he puts pen to is certain to be good. In the stories under notice he has given us some of
his best work. That they will be widely read is certain.”— Sydney Mail, July 8, 1893.
“ They present with force and vividness, as well as with the accuracy arising from long contact and keen observation, striking pictures of
parts of Australia unfamiliar to most of its inhabitants ; they tell, sometimes with remarkable power, of incidents such as happen, in wild places
when human hearts are stirred by strong passions, and of weird imaginings that move the minds of lonely men. ‘ The Last of Six ’is a terrible
tale of cannibalism, treachery, and revenge upon the dead, which in other hands might be gross and hideous, but which Mr. I' avenc makes of
thrilling interest. ‘ The Haunt of the Jinkarras’ suggests Rider Haggard and his imitators to some extent, but is itself relieved from the
suspicion of imitation by faithful local colour and a grotesquerie of conception, in which Mr. Favenc here and there approaches Poe. This
characteristic is especially noticeable in ‘ Spirit Led,’ which the great American might have written. ‘ A Cup of Cold Water is, perhaps, the
best talc in a collection that should be widely read, and which forms a worthy addition to purely Australian literature.”— Daily Telegraph.
July 15, 1893.
“ ‘ The Last of Sixand other stories. By Ernest Favenc. (Sydney: The Bulletin Newspaper Co ) This is a collection of short but
graphic sketches by Mr. Favenc, the well-known explorer, who has a rare collection of Australian legendary lore. All the stories here are good,
and we can heartily endorse the recommendatory notice by Rolf Boldrewood prefixed to this collection. The present issue forms the third of The.
Bulletin series of Australian reminiscences.”— Australian Star, July 15, 1893.
