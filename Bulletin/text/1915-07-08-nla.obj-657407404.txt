KULTUR.
One must have a bit of ehaos in one’s soul if one
wishes to give birth to a dancing star. — Nietzsche.
Your own prophet confounds you!
We mean to keep intact our kin with chaos —
The throbbing turbulence,
The royal rebel, the protester
That laughs at rule and over-regulation.
We will obey the laws we make ourselves;
We wish to grow like grass and flow like torrents,
Not to be clipped to gardens of geometry
Or curbed within your sentineled canals.
And flatly we decline to deify mere mechanism.
Know you not, Kultur,
That an ideally perfect machine would not go?
Ask any engineer.
It is the little touch of ramshackleness —
The irreconcilable, not to be regulated,
Innate cussedness of everything—
That allows the thing to work.
Know you not, Kultur,
That academically accurate drawing is bad art?
Ask any artist.
So your drill sergeants’ dominating damnation
Is not for us—who are artists and engineers
Coping with the chaos of a continent....
We do not tread another man’s trail;
We go ’cross 10t5....
But off the highways we kick up nuggets.
We surprise unexpected divinity,
And get lost to find ourselves.
We will scrap any philosophy or burn any Bible.
We take science as a signpost to the unknown, not
as the unknown itself;
We daub no idols out of meta'physic mud.
Behind the triangulating theories of your professors
We see the elusive grin of the Cosmos.
The chorale of eternity is not a goose-step
Or the way to Paradise a strategic railway.
We try to grow greater by bowing to a greater,
By inspiring the floodtide of the Infiuite,
By falterings and rude approximations,
By spasms and lapses and errors,
Growing with the healthy irregularity of living
things,
Never perfect and rigid, but ever alive,
As a man in his might is alive —
In his sins and his shames is alive —
In his power to make songs of his sins
And saints of his' shames is alive!
J. H. Greene, in N. Y. TIMES.
The Hun at Home
A peculiarly* interesting war-book is Sven
Hedin’s large volume, With the German
Armies in the West (translated from the
Swedish, Lane, 95.) ; for this great ex-
plorer is frankly and naively pro-Hunnish.
In fact, his name should be Hun Hedin.
He set forth from Sweden to visit the
German armies, with, he tells us, a per-
fectly open mind. For one thing, he
thought Jit would be instructive to see for
himself ‘*how far civilisation, Christianity
and pacificism had advanced 1914 years
after the birth of Christ.” For another
thing he was worried over the fact that
the press of the world had accused his
bosom friends, the Germans, of barbaric
cruelty. “Not for one moment did I be-
lieve these reports, but for the sake of the
Teutonic race I wanted to uproot this cal-
umny and to bring to light the truth.” In
this delightful sentence Hun Hedin gives
himself away. How did he know that this
accusation was a “calumny” before he set
forth to investigate the facts? So, armed
with an invitation from the German staff,
this explorer adventured on the quest of
atrocities. He didn’t find a single one: he is
quite emphatic on this point. Perhaps he
did not look in the right places; for being
the guest of the Kaiser, furnished with a
passport by the Chief of Staff, escorted
everywhere by an obliging German officer,
dining each night with the Crown Prince,
a General, a Serene Highness, a Foreign
Minister, an Imperial Chancellor, or a
Chief of Staff, he had not much opportunity
of discovering a tortured Belgian, a mur-
dered British prisoner or a raped French
child. But), somehow, despite this obvious
lack of evidence, Hun Hedin can’t shake
himself free from the subject. Even before
he reached the Front he talked with Moltke
“about the German soldiers, their humane
conduct and kindly camaradie towards pri-
soners and wounded opponents,” and
he agreed with his friend that the atrocity
tales were “without foundation and in
themselves highly improbable.” Next “for
the sake of truth,” he wishes “solemnly to
protest before God that the allegations of
certain foreign newspapers of atrocities are
a mean lie and a shameless calumny. Once
peace is restored and the French prisoners
are allowed to return home, they will them-
selves be able to testify to the treatment
they have received.” ' Unfortunately for
Hun Hedin, escaped French prisoners have
already returned home and testified, while
from the diaries of German soldiers still
more damning evidence has been unearthed.
J*
Presumably Hun Hedin was unaware of
the printed German war-regulations. The
picture this civilian draws of German
methods bears no resemblance to the instruc-
tii.ns given by the staff to officers. Thus
we learn: —
It must not be thought that the German
court-martials treat such cases lightly or
Imrshly. No; the court is utterly incorrupt-
ible, and carries out its task with the most
scrupulous thoroughness. Just as mitigating
circumstances are when possible adduced in
favor of a German soldier who —which is
very flare—has assaulted a woman and there-
fore been condemned to death, it is sought in
the same way to save the country’s own
children when they are accused of crime.
llun Hedin was led to this conviction by
the fact that he had inquired what became
of the whole of the inhabitants of a French
village arrested on the charge that shots
had been fired from that village upon the
Germans. Hedin’s German friend informed
the too-curious Swede that the prisoners
“were all released for lack of evidence!”
Hun Hedin believed him; what else was a
guest of the Kaiser to do?
It is strictly forbidden throughout the
German army to take anything, whatever it
may be, in a house or church in the occupied
territory, and any breach of this rule is very
severely punished... .To carry away “war
souvenirs” is considered in the German army
to be equivalent to theft. ( !)
S
The book bears the visee of the German
Chief of Staff. There is nothing in it that
he would not have written himself, except
a few naive slips, such as when Hun Hedin
mentions that German machine guns are
placed in church steeples; and the very
crimes that the world has proved against
the Hun are the very crimes that, needlessly,
the author again and again mentions to
deny. This Swede has paid, with interest,
for the cost of the motor-cars supplied by
his friends and his innumerable dinners
with the heads of the German army. He
spatters with fulsome eulogy and super-
latives of sycophantic praise every German
General and Serene Highness; but, fortu-
nately, his sickening snobbery is delight-
fully exposed by a couple of photographs
taken by the author. He terms a certain
hereditary princeling as “a beardless Apollo,
related to three royal houses.” His photo-
graph shows an undersized, tubby youth,
with a stupid and dour expression on un-
distinguished features. Remembering that
this insignificant fool is a beardless Apollo
to liun Hedin, we may somewhat modify
the superlatives bestowed upon the Kaiser
and the Crown Prince: —
And here stands the supreme war-lord, a
picture of manliness, resolution and _ honor-
able frankness... .But it is also his eyes
that possess a singular magnetic power, and
which fascinate all when the Emperor
enters. It is as if the whole room suddenly
became lighter They betray a certain
melancholy at the thought that all may not
understand that he is actuated absolutely
by the will to do what is pleasing unto God
[You see, Hun Hedin even knows the
Kaiser’s thoughts] His eyes betoken
honor, love of truth and a steadfast sin-
cerity... .The Emperor talked to me all the
time... .Surely no one thinks that I would
take the responsibility of attributing to the
Emperor opinions other than those which
had fallen from his lips and which I myself
had heard ! It would be an ill reward for
the hospitality I met with in the German
army. Tit would!]
The Crown Prince is one of those rare
men whom all men love and admire —all
except the English In the German army
he is looked upon as a very eminent general
—a born strategist.... He is fascinating
and congenial in the highest degree. .. .but
without artifice and modest like an ordinary
mortal.
But nowhere is this ingenuous author
more delightful than in his unctuous moral-
ising, which sounds to our ears like the
deepest irony.
Is it to be wondered at that one feels the
deepest pity and compassion for the innocent
people who are the greatest sufferers of the
war? Surely it is not an unkindly thought
towards France to strongly condemn the
policy which has brought such nameless mis-
fortune over the north-western portions of
the Republic. When one has seen all the
misery and grief, all the destruction and the
ruin following in the wake of the war, surely
one cannot with self-respect refrain from
loudly condemning the policy which alone is
the cause of it all! One deplores the
desolation which is spreading over their glori-
ous country, and which_might so easily have
been avoided. [How'?] Ask the old people
if they wanted the war, and if they think it
is for France’s good? When one travels
through Belgium one must harden one’s
heart, for at every step one is reminded of
the misfortune of having lost one’s liberty in
one’s own country. A moral judgment is
now being passed over Europe. Woe to the
people which has not in time put its house
in order, or which relies on paper treaties
and declarations when force sits in the judg-
ment seat!.... [Paper treaties that Germany
signed !]... .As one tarries by the roadside
to watch this procession of poor, half-starved
and frozen people deprived of livelihood,
home and country, one cannot but ask
“Whose is the fault?”
Hun Hedin does not answer his own
question. The world has answered it for
him.
This extraordinary book is, however, in-
dispensable to English readers because it
accurately expresses the opinions of the
German nation: Hun Hedin actually uses
the “we” in describing the Germans, so
closely does he identify himself with their
national aspirations; because it emphasises
the contempt and hatred felt for England
by the German army; and because it shows,
without nerd of emphasis, the tremendous
and admirably equipped war-machine that
we have yet to defeat. And there can be
no doubt but that behind that grim war-
machine there is a people united, self-sac-
rificing and fanatically determined to win—
or if of necessity it loses, to bring down in
its fall the whole of civilisation.
Gallipoli
Bards, “Bellerives” and others are cordi-
ally invited to compete for a guinea prize
for the best poem upon “Gallipoli,” written
in iambic blank verse or vers Hire. That
dauntless landing of our men on that his-
toric April 25 has been already commemo-
rated by official eulogy and personal descrip-
tion ; but the subject is one that should stir
the heart of every Australian bard. Com-
petitors can treat the subject of that landing
in whatever way they wish; but their offer-
ings must be, for this competition, sub-
mitted in the five-foot, iambic line of modern
blank verse, or in the freer metre of vers
libre, also unrimed. A specimen of one form
of vers libre is published on this page, and
other specimens of this so-called Futurist
poetry have recently appeared here. Poems
must reach this page by August 7.

“I tried to say, “God be very good to
you,” but the road was marked “no thor-
oughfare,” I also wanted to say, that the
kisses were not according to sample sent
from time to time. I think an analysis
would vary considerably, and I remember
moments of less import when the whole
force of your intense personality was con-
centrated in the almost brutal kisses show-
ered on me.
Did you ever notice they were not returned !
I think so because you once told me I was
cold, cold ! ,
Though I knew I was kissed for a man s
idle amusement I gave myself with reckless
prodigality and was acquiescent in the close
embrace caused by love for love (not the
woman). Don’t think I ever blamed you.
I knew something of the complexity of your

standing, forgave. ~ ..

The Repertory Theatre has come trium-
phantly into its own —not here —in New
York. The amateur is rushing in where the
commercial manager feared to tread. In
the recent New York season the commercial
managers have been poorly supported, while
Granville Barker’s English company, playing
a repertory season, has scored a huge success;
and two amateur organisations have not only
earned the critics’ highest superlatives of
praise, but are attracting an enthusiastic
public. None of these repertory organisa-
tions is playing uncommercial plays: each
is putting on a programme of non-commer-
cial plays. The N. Y. Bookman explains
the difference. The commercial theatre man-
agers are out for big business. The theatre
system of the U.S.A. is said to be in the con-
trol of less than 20 men. “These men have
organised our theatre-business as a big busi-
ness ; and in none of their productions can
they rest content with a profit of less than
10 per cent Thus plays that might earn
200dol. per week are killed off to make room
for other plays that might earn a profit of
2000dol. per week. In the frantic gamble of
big business large losses must be offset by
larger gains.” The uncommercial drama, the
sort that cannot pay its way, is not worth
fighting for; but the repertory organisations
do fight for the non-commercial drama, and
have proved that such a drama can be run
at a profit. The Washington Square players
are an organisation of amateurs who have
banded themselves together for the purpose
of having a thoroughly good time in writing
plays, acting them, producing them, design-
ing and executing scenery and costumes, and
attending to the details of business manage-
ment. They produced Maeterlinck’s Interior,
and a number of local one-act dramas; and
since their first night there has been no seat
vacant. The Neighborhood Players have a
new theatre of their own, said to be the
loveliest theatre in New York, equipped with
the only modern system of lighting m
the U.S., and situated in what is regarded as
the slums! Their first production included
Lord Dunsaney’s brilliant fantasy, The Glit-
tering Gate. And the repertory organisa-
tions of Australia are, this year, struggling
to produce, at intervals, and in any hall or
theatre that happens to be vacant, an occa-
sional non-commercial play.
Caricatures by Low, a special edition
limited to 250 copies, with four plates in

lished by Tyrrell’s, Castlereagh-street, Syd-
ney. This, the first collection of the well-
known Bulletin caricaturist, will comprise
400 caricatures of persons of importance and
politicians. Low’s work needs no recommen-
dation beyond his weekly work in this paper;
and those who possess the guinea are ad-
vised to apply without delay.
The N.S.W. Department of Public In-
struction has done the right patriotic thing
in publishing, for the use of the public
schools, Australians in Action: The Story of
Gallipoli, containing the reports by Ashmead
Bartlett and C. E. W. Bean, of the daunt-
less landing at the Dardanelles, It is pro-
posed to read these stirring accounts in class,
after which the booklet, which is well illus-
trated, will become the property of individual
pupils.
Bully Hayes, “barrator, bigamist, bucca-
neer, blackbirder and pirate,” compiled by
A. T. Saunders, is published by the Perth
Sunday Times for private circulation. It
contains a portrait of the author, but none
of Bully Hayes. Saunders has little that is
new to say, but his compilation from the
files of the press is a useful and compre-
hensive one. And it seems a needless excess
of modesty to make the circulation private.
Mawn-dorners are politely asked to cease

Rifle And Pistol Cartridges
When you buy rifle and pistol cartridges you want
them to be sure-fire and accurate, and to have the
proper speed and penetration—qualities which are all
essential for good shooting. There is nothing in the
appearance of a cartridge that indicates whether
it does or docs not possess these qualities, for the
elements that make them cannot be seen. Therefore
when buying you have to rely upon reputation.
Winchester Rifle and Pistol Cartridges enjoy the
highest reputation the world over for quality and
reliability. When you buy, if you will insist upon hav-
ing Winchester make you can feel confident of getting
cartridges which are sure to give the fullest measure of
shooting satisfaction. Look for the Won the box. It is

No Better Medicine
for the Nerves.
Clements
Tonic
The following letter was re-
ceived from Miss Endacott. of
Egan Street, Newtown. Suf-
fering from weak nerves and
generally had health for some
time, she took this medicine to
build lip her system. This is
the letter she writes for all
women to read :
CLEMENTS TOXIC LTD.
“I have taken Clements Tonic oft' and on for many months, so also
have many of my friends.
“During the last trying summer the oppressive heat created fatigue
of my nerves, so much so that I have at times been seriously indisposed.
“1 speak of this medicine as I find it, and for giving the nerves
strength, creating appetite and good rest, it is really a wonderful
medicine.
“Many others whom I know speak of this remedy as I do. It is
the best nef've strengthener 1 have ever used.
“(Signed) HILDA EXDACOTT.”
- Many women are martyrs to weak nerves, depressed spirits, poor digestion,
sick headache, irregular heart action, and loss of sleep. If this medicine is
taken regularly for a few weeks they will find a permanent, improvement in their
health. It builds up the system rapidly.

Jasper.
WliD is Jasper? In the city
Men will say the best of fellows.
Such a one as time and trouble
Only mellows.
Such a garden-plot liis life seems
As a tall, strong wall encloses
Shutting care out —all his roses
Thornless roses.
\\ atch him when his work is finished.
How he walks with eyes elated.
Or jests gaily o’er his liquor,
Boonly mated.
He is good to look on- —pleasant.
_ Strong and tall, and young, moreover.;
Yet, ’tis curious, not one woman
Calls him lover.
Someone says there was a woman.
Says they loved and stormed and parted;
Yet I doubt it. finding Jasper
So light-hearted.
Hear his. talk, and you’ll think likewise.
t Note his laugh, and in his laughter
You’ll feel sunshine —ne’er a shadow
Stealing after.
Such is Jasper, good to mate with
"When an hour or two hangs idle,
And one gives the soul within him
Free-flung bridle.
Then, released from shop or market,
Stool or counter, ink and paper,
Talking largely, fact and figure
Melt like vapor.
Yet last night, when last we parted,
He and I—we two. we only -
How was it he seemed so alien.
Looked so lonely?
Oh. that moment set me thinking.
Sent my curious fancies straying
Round the man and round his manner.
Set them saying :
“But another man is Jasper
When, beside the dying embers.
Thronged about by Rembrandt shadows
He remembers.”

Tapu.
If you love eternal quiet go to Thames and
motor out
Straight to Tapu ;
I or the fly’s foot falls like Thunder, you can
hear the mushrooms sprout.
There at Tapu.
Oh, the world’s a heaving turmoil, and this
life’s at best a 'snare,
And it’s mighty hard to grab a scrap of
comfort anywhere ;
But suave silence undiluted soothes for aye
all things that be
Down in lazy, lonesome Tapu by the sea.
If fishing be your hobby there’s a plan that
cannot fail
Out at Tapu;
You wade into the shallows, and vou seize
’em by the tail
When at Tapu.
For the fish and birds and creeping things
scarce murmur in their sleep,
And the day can’t break the stillness which
is wonderful and deep—
They’re much too tired to take their food
(two meals a day, or three)
Down at languid, lolling Tapu by the sea.
It’s dead as Julius Caesar, and no late Last
Trump will stir
Drowsy Tapu.
If your wife’s loud mother’s mad as mad. you
still can live with her
Here at Tapu.
Never mind the why and wherefore of the
clamors of the world ;
In this silence ancient oysters snore, their
little toes included.
And the zephyrs toss the limpets round with
cool unblinking glee
Down at loafing, lovely Tapu by the sea.
A hen I’m dead beyond recalling you can
smile and say, -“He’s gone
Back to Tapu.
At last lie’s out of mischief. Bet your life
there’s nothing on
There at Tapu.
He made a bit of hubbub when he, grace-
less, blurred these ways,
But he’s sleeping now for ever ’mid the
immemorial haze
Of the things that couldn’t matter in the*
least to you and me,
Down in lost, ladoodlin’ Tapu by the sea!”
MAOIITL.VXI).
FRANK MORTON.
One Hundred Years Ago.
To-day, absorbed with various peddling
cares,
Of that mean sort that every man must
know,
I stumbled suddenly all unawares
Upon a page torn from the long ago.
Each faded line with valor seemed to glow.
And brave steel clashed and guns their
smoke-clouds blew
Through that old print that let grey London
know
The glories of the field of Waterloo.
How strange to think old London must have
held
Poor stay-at-homes like us who fired no shot.
While close at hand the roar of History
swelled,
And heroes sought our foes with ardor hot!
These only live; the others matter not.
Time judges well, and it .has judged them
so.
Ah ! we in turn will all be well forgot
When Fame recites “One hundred years
ago”

THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AS
A HORSE-COPER.
The time is ripe, and has been these many
months, for the Australian Government to
review the horse-buying side of its activities.
Nothing is to be gained at this stage by
gloomy regrets that the Commonwealth didn’t
long ago do the obvious thing, and institute
national horse-breeding farms as a corollary
to national service. The nation can’t
wait now—it is “up against it.
Horses are needed for transport, for
artillery, and for the cavalry work
which will begin as soon as the operations
in the mountainous parts of Gallipoli are
over; and they are needed in thousands.
Horses can be bought for the Government
in two ways. Reputable experts may be
employed at fixed salaries; or experts of
any description may be allowed to butt into
the trade, and exploit it for what it is
worth to them. The Bulletin’s point is
that the latter system is in use to a great
extent, with the results that an inferior
class of horse is being bought, that the far-
mers and horse-breeders are not getting a
fair deal, and that the Commonwealth is
being bled of money which it cannot afford
to squander. #
Here is an outrageous arrangement which
is in working order in at least one part of
the Commonwealth. A private-enterprise
buyer has control of the business. It is his
monopoly, so far as his particular district
is concerned. He is not paid a salary, like
any other Government servant. Be may
be working on a commission basis, or he
may be toiling for no remuneration at all,
and as a matter of pure patriotism. Over
this question there hovers an atmosphere of
mystery. What is perfectly certain, how-
ever, is that his agents and sub-agents, and
their runners and touts and heelers, are in
the game for big profits. And what is fur-
ther certain is that many of them have
made big profits. . The business of
the agents and sub-agents in the Backblooks
is to find the horses for their principal. To
that end they proceed to different centres
and advertise in the local press that “the
Government buyer will be at Blank on the
Nth ” The inhabitants with possible re-
mounts to sell turn up. They know that the
Government price is in the neighborhood of
£2O, and —always provided they haven’t had
previous experience of the methods of the
Government buyer’s agents—they bring that
class of animal along. If there were await-
ing them at the saleyard a salaried official
whose business it was to buy a lot of £2O
horses as expeditiously as possible, and then
got on to the next centre, there would be
no trouble. Instead, the farmers are liable
to find, masquerading as Australia, so to
speak, some notorious bucolic jobber —one
who is up to every trick in the imperishable
old game of coping, and who is there to get
his own “cut” regardless of his principal,
the Commonwealth, or any other considera-
tion. It is plain, in the circumstances, that
a £2O horse is not going to fetch anything
like its value. The farmer who has brought
such a horse into town, and who possibly
needs the money for it, has the option be-
tween dragging it home again and going to
bed with the reflection that he has wasted
his day, or sacrificing it for the £l2 or £l4
which he is offered. He mostly does the
latter, and returns blaspheming the Defence
Department and resolving that he will see
it further before he gives it the refusal of
another genuine remount.
* * * *
In the above case nobody except the fre-
quently drought-smitten farmer suffers. But
latterly the breeder has grown wise to the
situation. He has come to appreciate that
when the “Government buyer” asks for £2O
horses he usually means £l5 or £lO crocks.
There is a ready sale for the better sort ot
animal. The “East” is calling for service-
able walers as insistently as ever, and the
Imperial authorities are ready to take all
the sound, young remounts that Australia
can send. The intelligent breeder, therefore,
reserves his equine ruins for the use of his
fellow countrymen, and disposes of the
others to Governments which are willing
to pay a fair price for them. The differ-
ence between the value of each horse bought
and the amount of money which, the Govern-
ment ultimately disburses for it is one of
the prices paid by the Commonwealth for
the luxury of horse-buying on private-enter-
prise lines.
* * * *
There are other and even bigger penalties,
however. A man wrote to this paper the
other day from the Remount Depot at
Cairo, stating that he examined daily some
400 horses and that in his opinion “only 25
per cent, of that number were ever fit to
leave Australia.” Naturally so. The vast
majority of the 30,000 horses which have
gone to Egypt were bought on the lines indi-
cated above. The only difference as regards
the 75 per cent, of bad horses was that in
most cases the Government was swindled
instead of the breeder. With the 25 per cent,
the Government paid £2O for a remount
which was worth the money, but had been
got from the breeder for £l5; as to the
75 per cent. it paid £2O for an
animal which was worth perhaps £lO,
or possibly, again, nothing, and had
been got for, say, £l2. It is bad that the
farmer should be taken down, and it is
wrong that the Commonwealth should be
swindled, but it is ten thousand times worse
that the lives of the men who are defending
the country should be imperilled by inferior
horseflesh. A comparatively minor dis-
ability is suffered by the Commonwealth.
The horses which are selected by the various
agents and sub-agents are trucked in all
directions free of charge. They proceed by
rail from one agent’s depot to another, and
from any of the depots to the coast, and the
legend “Expeditionary Forces” chalked on
the van serves instead of cash. There is
nothing to hinder any of the parties con-
cerned from mixing their own horses, de-
signed for private sale elsewhere, with the
Government horses, and human nature be-
ing what it is, it is probable that a lot. of
this is being done. Meanwhile starving
stock is dying by the thousand for
lack of transport facilities, and the price
of meat is rising, because, amongst other
things, of the dearth of trucks to take
“stores” to market. Good Australians
wouldn’t so much mind seeing their stock
perish in the country, and watching the
price of beef bound upwards in the city, if
they knew that these calamities were neces-
sary in the interests of the soldiers abroad.
But when they find that the soldiers are
actually suffering and that the chief, or at
any rate the most obvious, beneficiaries are
people who have earned for themselves the
reputations of being “warm propositions, ’
they feel that there is something outrage-
ously wrong. # #
It is not too much to say that throughout
many country districts the Government
horse-buying business smells to the heavens.
Horse-dealers have got rich quickly. And
this is no time for men concerned in Gov-
ernment contracts to be getting rich quickly.
It indicates that the nation’s money is being
thrown about ; and as the Prime Minister
of Britain said last week :
Waste on the part of either the individual or the
classes, which is always foolish and shortsighted, is at
these times nothing short of a national danger.
Putting aside all other considerations it is
up to the Government to get its horses good,
and to get them at a fair price. It will
never do either while it works on the pre-
sent lines. The horse-buying combines,
where they exist, need to be broken up.
Real Government buyers, as opposed to the
bogus ones who have been operating freely
in the Backblocks, should be appointed at
fixed salaries. It ought to be easy enough
to find men with a knowledge of horseflesh,
and where to look for it, who wduld be above
the thought of making money out of their
country’s extremity. But in case here and
there the almost world-old lure prevailed—
that tendency which afflicts even the loftiest
characters to abandon scruple when enter-
ing upon a horse-deal —the Government
might arrange to examine, with rigorous
care, into every separate transaction. That
it hasn’t been doing so up to now is obvious
on the most casual glance at some of the
wrecks that have been lumbered on to it.
THE HEATED RUSH TO DO NOTHING
EXCEPT TALK.
The opening of butchers’ shops being an
obviously futile proposition, the prohibition
of exports being unthinkable since Cohen’s
bill has to be met, and the application of
Necessary Commodities Commision theories
to the meat market too dangerous an experi-
ment, various politicians have felt that they
must make some sort of a demonstiation in
front of the expensive chop, otherwise their
reputations as vigilant Democrats mteht
vanish. Therefore they have been talking
in a whirl about the slaughter of female
stock, giving the populace an impression
that they were going to deal with a situation
created by the rascally graziers’ assassina-
tion of heifers and ewes. It is all nonsense.
* * *
If the killing of female stock were pro-
hibited to-morrow morning the certain result
would be to make meat dearer than ever, for
there would be an enormous reduction in the
number of animals offered for sale. ihe
meat famine would then have arrived sure
enough. A time comes in the life of a ewe
when it has to be killed; there ar '. some ewe
lambs which, owing to thpir breed and the
particular pursuit of the breeder, have no
other destiny than the slaughter-house;
cows become an embarrassment to a grazier
once they are fat if he has springers coming
forward to take their place. In the dairy-
ing districts thousands of calves fulfil their
function in the scheme of nature by merely
coming into existence. It may possibly be
the case—in fact, is highly probable—that
the selection of stock for butchery according
to sex is carried oh in a manner which might
be improved upon if the whole industry were
conducted on scientific lines and as a joint-
stock concern. But it isn’t. The industry
is a large, scattered affair participated in
by thousands of individuals over a vast terri-
tory, and under widely different conditions.
On any given day it may be a perfectly
proper thing for Bill Smith, of Carpen-
taria, to sell a draft of fat cows, yet an
act of lunacy for Tom Jones, of the Rivei-
ina, to dispose of one, fat or lean, even it
the Providence which had starved his
wretched animals all the year had now left
it on his hands. It is the same thing with
sheep. What is a Government going to say
to Blank, of Bourke, who has a thousand
fat ewes to sell ? That he must keep, them.
No Government could do it and survive the
yell that would go up from all the Blanks
in the State with ewes and no grassland the
other Blanks in the towns and cities with
breakfast to get and no chops. Have any
of these random politicians who are running
round with keys to lock the doors of empty
stables become possessed of an infallible
patent for breeding with certainty of sex.
Unless they have, their duty is to get on
with the business most of them are shirking
—not to potter round and make a still
greater mess. There are heaps of things they
have not yet done—dozens of things that
Australia wants badly to see done. *
This talk about the system or lack of
system of killing stock being a gieat
national peril is clearly the result of frantic
thinking about votes. The continent was
for a couple of years or so in the grip ot a
serious drought, and the mortality among
stock and the absence of grass had no rela-
tion to the sex of the victims or the sur-
vivors. Had the years been as fat as the
previous ones, how many people would have
b»en talking about ewes and heifers to-day t
None! Yet the cause of peril, if there is
one, would have been there just the same.
Australia has had droughts before and
recovered from them, and will recover from
the last one. In 1900 there were 70 million
sheep in Australia; in 1912, notwithstand-
ing an intervening drought and heavv kill-
ing, the number was 83 millions. Of rattle
there were eight millions and 11 millions in
those respective years. The rains and grass
caused the increase. The absence of mois-
ture and food led to thj decrease last year
by the twin processes of starvation and
checking reproduction. And while the poli-
ticians are irrelevantly talking about nebu-
lous schemes of regulation (to save their
faces in other directions) the magnificent
Northern Territory, where rains have been
bounteous and feed rotting into the ground,
remains unconnected by rail with the rest
of Australia, and is over-run by cattle at the
rate of 77 animals to 100 square miles, and
congested with 14 sheep to a similar area.
And the Murray waters continue to run
away to sea, and the thousands of tons of
forage that might be grown bv their use
have to be hurriedly telegraphed for from
San Francisco and Buenos Aires. The settle-
ment of the Northern Territory and its con-
nection by rail with the South, and the
impounding of water now running to waste,
are practical propositions within the region
of accomplishment. They would put a
different aspect on the problems of meat
supplies and ameliorate the hardships aim
losses through drought. But they are left
out in the wilderness for dingoes to howl at,
and in place of enlightened action by states-
men the community gets the hot air of
politicians.
THE STONES OF GOSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, here is a tale of the Glugs of Gosh
In the end of the year uni teen ;
Of the Glugs of Gosh .and. their great King
Splosh,
And Tush, his virtuous Queen.
And here is a tale of the Oglike Ogs,
In the neighboring land of Podge;
Of their sayings and doings and plottings
and brewings,
And something about Sir Stodge.
Wise to profundity,
Stout to rotundityj
That was the Knight Sir Stodge.
Oh. the lying was rich, and the Queen was
fair, . ■<?£'
And they made a very respectable pair.
And whenever a Glug, in that peaceful land,
Did anything no one could understand
The Knight. Sir Stodge, he looked in a book.
And charged that Glug with the crime called
Crook.
And the great Judge Fudge, who wore for a
The skin of a female tortoiseshell-cat,
He fined that Glug for his actions rash,
And frequently asked to be paid in cash.
Then every Glug went home to rest
With his head in a bag and his toes to the
west;
For they knew it was best,
Since their grandpas slept with tlieir toes to
the west.
But all of the tale that is so far told
Has nothing whatever to do
With the Ogs of Podge, and their crafty
dodge,
And the trade in pickles and glue.
To trade with the Glugs came the Ogg to
Gosh,
And they said in the mildest of tones:
“We’ll sell you pianers and pickles and
spanners
For seventeen shiploads of stones —
Smooth ’uns or nobbly ’uns,
Firm ’uns or wobbly ’uns,
All that we ask is stones.”
And the King said “What?” and the Queen
said “Why, .
That is awfully cheap to the things I buy!
That grocer of ours in the light brown hat
Asks two-und-eleven for pickles like that!”
But a Glug stood up with a wart on his nose,
And he cried: “Your Majesties! Ogs is
foes
But the Glugs cried, “Peace! Will you hold
your jaw! .
How did our grandpas fashion the law i
Said the Knight, Sir Stodge, as he opened a
book,
“If the goods were cheap, then the goods
they took.”
So they fined the Glug with the wart on his
nose
For wearing a wart with his everyday
clothes.
And the goods were bought through a Glug
named Jones ; *■
And the Ogs went home with their loads of
stones,
Which they landed with glee in the land of
Podge.
I)r> vou notice the dodge?
Not yet? Well, no more did the Knight, Sir
Stodge.
In the following summer the Ogs came back
With a cargo of eight-day clocks. ,
And hand-painted and sewing
machines,
And mangles, and scissors, and socks.
And they said: “For these excellent tilings
we bring
We are ready to take more stones;
And in bricks or road metal for goods you
will settle
Indented by your Mr. Jones.”
Cried the Glugs, praisingly :
“Why, liow amazingly
Smart of industrious Jones !”
And the King said “Hum !’’ and the Queen
said “Oo!
That curtain ! Oh, what a bee-ootiful blue!”
But a Glug stood up with some very large
ears,
And said : “There is more in this thing than
appears!
So we ought to be taxing these goods of the
Ogs,
Or our industry soon will be gone to the
dogs.”
And the King said, “Bosh! You’re un-Glug-
gish and rude!”
And the Queen said, “What an absurd atti-
tude !”
And the Glugs cried, “Down with political
quacks!
How did our grandpas look at a tax?”
So, the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened a
book:
“No tax,” said he, “wherever I look.”
Then they fined the Glug with the prominent
ears
For being old-fashioned by several years;
And the Ogs went home with the stones, full
steam.
Do you notice the scheme?
Not yet? Nor the Glugs in their dreamiest
dream.
Then every month to the land of Gosh
The Ogs they continued to come,
With buttons and hooks and medical books
And rotary engines and rum,
Large cases with labels, occasional tables,
Hair tonic and fiddles and ’phones ;
And the Glugs, while concealing their joy in
the dealing,
Paid promptly in nothing but stones.
Why, it was screamingly
Laughable, seemingly—
Asking for nothing but stones!
And the King said “Haw!” And the Queen
said “Oh!
Our drawing-room now is a heavenly show
Of large overmantels and whatnots and
chairs,
And a statue of Splosh at the head of the
stairs* 5
But a Glug stood up with a cast in his eye,
And he said : “Far too many such baubles we
buy,; . 1
With all the Gosh factories closing their
doors,
And the importers’ warehouses lining our
But the Glusrs cried: “Down with such
meddlesome fools!
What did our grandpas lay down in their
rules?”
And the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened his
book : ,
“To cheapness,” he said, “was the road tney
took.”
Then every Glug that was not too tat
Turned seventeen handsprings, and jumped
on his hat. .
And they fined the Glug with the cast in his
eye
For looking two ways at the tenth of July,
And for having no visible Precedent, which
Is a crime in the poor and a fault in the rich.
And the Glugs cried “Straoth !” which is
Gluggish, you know, ,
Fbr a phrase that, in English, is charmingly
low.
Are you grasping it? No?
Well, we haven’t got very much farther to go.
Now it chanced one day, in the middle of
May,
There came to the great King Splosh
A policeman who said, while scratching his
head:
“There isn’t a stone in Gosh
To throw at a dog ; for the crafty Og,
Last Saturday week, at one.
Took our last blue-metal in order to settle
A bill for a toy pop-gun.”
Said the King, jokingly:
“Why, how provokingly
Weird ! But we have the gun.”
And the King said: “Well, we are stony
broke !**
But the Queen couldn’t see it was much of
a j°ke. , .
And she said \ <4 lf the metal .s all used up*


Pray what of the costume I want for the
Cup?
It all seems so dreadfully simple to me.
The stones? Why import ’em from over the
sea !”
But a Clug stood up with a mole on his chin,
And he said, with a most diabolical grin :
“Your Majesties, down in the country of
Podge
A spv has unravelled a very cute dodge ;
And the Ogs are determined to wage a war
On the Clugs next Friday, at half-past
four!”
Then the dugs all cried in a terrible fright:
“How did our grandpas manage a fight?”
And the Knight, Sir Stodge, he opened a
book,
And he read: “Some very large stones they
took
And flung at the foe with exceeding force:
Which was very effective, though rude, of
course.”
And, 10, with sorrowful wails and moans,
The Glugs cried : “Where, oh, where are the
stones?”
And some rushed north, and a few ran west,
Seeking the substitutes seeming best.
And they gathered the pillows and cushions
and rugs
From the homes of the rich and the middle-
class Glugs.
And a hasty message they managed to send
Craving the loan of some bricks from a
friend.
Do you now comprehend?
Well, hold on at the curve, for we’re nearing
the end.
On Friday exactly at half-past four
Came the Ogs with a warlike glee;
And the first of their stones hit poor Mr.
Jones,
The Captain of Industry.
Then a pebble of Podge took the Knight, Sir
Stodge,
In the pit of his convex vest.
He muttered “Un-Gluggish !” His heart grow-
ing sluggish,
He solemnly sank to rest.
'Tis inconceivabV—■
Hardly believable—
Yet he was sent to rest.
And the King said “Oucli!” and the Queen
said “Oo!
My bee-ootiful drawing-room! What shall I
do?”
But the Oglike Ogs they hurled great rocks
Through the works of the wonderful eight-
day clocks
They had sold to the Glugs but a month
before—
Which is very absurd, but, of course, it’s
war.
And the Glugs cried: “What would our
grandpas do
If they hadn’t the stones that they one time
threw ?”
But the Knight, Sir Stodge, and his mystic
book
Oblivious slept in a graveyard nook.
VICTORIA.
DEN.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Joss that Objects to Having Its
Feet Examined.
“We would have welcomed the criticism of
the Opposition,” said Hughes with regretful
solemnity after Cook and his following had
bolted out of the House of Reps, last week.
If the Attorney-General meant that he was
sorry there had been a discontinuation of
Liberal yelps and expletives, his sadness can
be understood, for the undisciplined discharge
of explosives from Cook and co. forms an
asset of substantial value to the Government.
But if Hughes meant that the normal atti-
tude of the Ministry was one of hospitality
towards the critic, then he was taking a
great liberty with the Speaker’s leg. There
is.nothing party politicians dislike more than
criticism; to party organisation, of every
brand, it is anathema. A critic can no more
exist in the Labor party or the Liberal party
than a Brahmin can hope for election as
President of the Wesleyan Conference.
Parties uon’t want criticism—they want to
live in peace and quiet. A critic on their
own side is a traitor; on the other side, a
bore or a capitalist or a Socialist. In any
case, he is an object of derision and dislike.
Therefore such criticism as the public hears
in Parliament is invariable hobbled bv con-
sideration for the workings of the ‘party
machine. _ It is merely the reflex of partisan
manoeuvring, and everywhere are Parliaments
putrifying and principles rotting through the
influence of this sinister agency. There must
be many Liberals who dissent from Joe
Cook’s tactics—who writhe under the whip
that compels them to adjust their tune to the
pipings of Millen and Forrest. Anstey
is certainly not the only member of the other
side who, if Parliament were free from the
sterilising influences of party, would address
to Ministers some necessary words of warn-
ing about policy and methods. There was
the case of Macdougall in the Senate the
other day—the occasion on which some possi-
bly useful criticism in relation to munitions
of war was interrupted by objections from
Pearce, who raised the issue of the
speaker’s party “loyalty.” Clearly in
Pearce’s mind a member of the Legislature
who knows something which the party
machine doesn’t want the public to know is
a renegade if he dares to open his mouth on
the subject, his proper function being to let
things slide. In truth, he is a renegade if
he does let them slide. The representative of
the community who keeps silent when he
knows that a wrong should be exposed be-
comes a traitor to the democracy which
elected him. Particularly is the matter of
munitions not one Australians can afford to
see made the sport of parties or of bungling
inefficients. It is a national question, every
aspect of which should be discussed with un-
reserved frankness and sincerity by all mem-
bers of Parliament. And it would be so dis-
cussed —and so, too, would the Referenda,
the tariff, the Northern Territory, the trans-
continental railway and every other impor-
tant issue in which the public has a vital in-
terest —if members were not held in thrall by
this plague called Party, and if Ministries
were elected to be the servants of Parliament.
An Australian.
“Kettledrum” tolls the story of Richard
O’lTalloran, Australian :
It is the plain tale of a strong man smitten in the
pride of his strength by a stronger destiny. He lies
helpless and hopeless, whose help might have been
so great and whose hope so gloriously burned, on a
bed in the Melbourne Hospital. The body that was
the habitation of a dauntless soul is crushed to gall-
ing uselessness. He was run down in a city street
by a motor-car whose driver escaped while passers-by
picked up the broken victim.
With a purpose that never weakened he had come
3000 miles from the dry heart of Queensland to join
those other Australians whose manhood was being
proved by war as his has been proved in peace. His
sure intent was to be one of those who have made
the shambles of Gallipoli an altar where, above its
human sacrifice, burns the flame of an undying glory.
Like them, he was an Australian. For many that is
explanation enough. But let it also be said that he
was the kind of Australian with whom one is proud
to share foothold on a continent—the continent
he crossed with such deluded hope. Delusions
such as his are held by some to be the certainties of
a future immortality.
There are no recruiting posters along the Hergott,
where drought has swept a track to the iron horizon.
Ygt it was here he saw his duty. There are no brass
bands in the far baekbloeks of Queensland. Yet there
O’Halloran heard a clearer call than the challenge
of the trumpets. No sooner had he news of the fight
at Gallipoli than he left the mob he was travelling
with in search of grass and headed straight for the
colors, of which he would have been so steadfast a
standard-bearer.
At Birdsville he saddled a fresh horse for the long
ride of 350 miles to enlist. The drought said “Halt
you can t get through.” So he sold his horse and
booted it to Jundah—-every mile over sun-smitten
sands. His food was flour and water, and on that
fare he pushed through, searching for the water as he
went.
Lo?igreach at last—and he stood up, sun-tanned,
travel-stained and taciturn, for the medical test!
“Right,” said the doctor, and then by coach and
train O’Halloran went south to Melbourne to accom-
pany the Light Horse to the Front. A little sight-
seeing in crowded streets after the lonely journeys—
and then Fate, which had held him harmless and
given him safe conduct for hundreds and hundreds of
miles, struck a lightning blow.
He will never reach the fighting-line. But let
those remember, for whom the effort is too great to
take a tram to the recruiting dep6t—let those remem-
ber how indomitably O’Halloran tried.
The Bitter Wail of the Foreign Trader.
In Britain a firm which completed a deal
in iron with Krupp’s before the war broke
out and then delivered the goods has got
six months in two places in addition to a
thumping fine for accepting the enemy’s
cash. The jury recommended the Judge to
go easy, so it ip probable that if the Judge
had gone hard the punishment would have
been something with boiling oil in it. In
Australia certain importers who sent for
Hogman goods while the peace was still un-
broken are in difficulty over getting delivery
of their wares which were found on cap-
tured enemy vessels. Delivery has been
refused on various grounds, as, for example,
(1) that the receipt for the money was
signed after the war began, although the
cheque was signed in Australia weeks be-
fore, (2) that the consignee cannot prove
that the goods have been paid for, and (3)
that the consignee can only prove payment
to the person from whom he bought the
goods, and is unable to show that the
original manufacturer got his money. In
all. these cases the cost, insurance and
freight of the goods must be paid over
again to the Customs, and a document
signed releasing the latter from liability.
Naturally the importer feels that he
is getting a bad deal. He is told
that his other plan is to make no
claim in regard to the goods on the
captured vessels, but to regard the Hog-
man shipper as having failed to supply the
orders and to claim from him at the close
of the war a refund of any cash paid for the
assorted shoddy. The difficulty which this
course presents is found in the extreme like-
lihood of the responsible person being
bayoneted, bombed or bankrupt before the
war-drums cease from throbbing. The
importing people concerned have a griev-
ance which is genuine enough in its way,
but if their case were a thousand times
worse they would get precious little Aus-
tralian sympathy. The public recognises
too thoroughly that the money sent from
this country to Germany has helped to buy
those very guns that are now killing Aus-
tralian soldiers at the Dardanelles and in
France. The moral for the foreign trader
would seem to be that, if he feels he must
import cheap goods into Australia, he
should confine his trade to those countries
which can never be at war with us. In
point of fact, the only European States
which are absolutely safe in this respect
are Monaco, San Marino and Andorra ; and
if all these were imported bodily they would
scarcely be noticed on one of our back-
country runs.

What Parliaments Are Made Of.
As a result of the recent appeal to the
Queensland democracy, Ryan finds him-
self at the head of a Parliamentary party
swollen beyond all proportion to the votes
cast on his side at the poll. A count shows
that, while Labor scored 60 per cent, of
the votes —the majority being 35,000 —it
has 70 per cent, of the seats. This is an
obviously ridiculous result. Yet it is not as
ridiculous as it might have been. At the
previous election Dent-iam romped home
with a most decisive majority in the
Assembly, yet at the polls he had’ a majority
of a mere 5000 votes. An examination of
what has since occurred discloses that if
only 7000 electors had changed sides—that
is, if Ryan had been only 2000 to the good
—the Butterman would have been just as
disastrously upended. No doubt it would
have been a joyful circumstance; but it is
a mighty perilous foundation on which to
base complete changes of policy, since Ryan
and the whole Labor scheme may be turned
out by the caprice of just the same few
people. As the case actually stood, Ryan
and Denham went to the country under
conditions which made it possible for 7$ per
cent, of the voters to command the situa-
tion. Because they happened to swing one
particular way, Ryan landed the bacon;
and next time he asks for the popular ver-
dict the swaying of 30 per cent, the wrong
way will, under the same method of votin'*,
settle his hash and the policy under which
the whole 100 per cent, are to live. What-
ever this sort of thing may be it is not
government by the people. It is govern-
ment by a relative handful of individuals
whose votes were most likely this time
determined by personal dislike "for Denham,
as, later on, they may be by a hatred of
Ryan —government by the fluid, unstable
section of a community. No one has to
travel very far to see the demoralising influ-
ence of this pitch-and-toss business on the
character of parties and Parliaments.

Are Wives Wild Beasts?
“Garnishor” on the law of it:—
From the fact that “a husband is liable for his
wife’s torts," the disingenuous deduction is drawn by
“Anti-Snuffle” (B. 17/6/’l5) that woman is placed
in a favored position. The truth is, and is intended
to be, that failure in a lawsuit involves not only
the wife’s punishment, but that of her husband as
well. This arises from the degraded view which the
law takes of women. For practical purposes it ranks
them lower than the domestic animals, and on a level
with ferae naturae. Certain things—sometimes living,
sometimes inanimate—are grouped by lawyers as
“wild beasts.” A man owns them “at his peril.”
Though lawyers would argue that the reason is that
the Common Law allowed a wife no separate entity,
the fact remains that she really falls within this
category. If she does any injury the law constitutes
her a nuisance, for which the husband who owns her
is responsible.
This state of affairs can be illustrated by the famous
Doctrine of Scienter, meaning knowledge of in-
herent vice, which is ancient as English Law itself,
and which deals with animals damage feasant. The
law requires of persons having in their custody in-
struments of danger that they should keep them with
the utmost care. But as to domestic animals this
rule is relaxed. In the case of a dog, for instance,
there is a general belief that he is “entitled to his
first bite.” He is not, but he is entitled to bite if
his owner has no knowledge of his fierceness. The
present law, as it relates to domestic animals
throughout almost the whole of the Empire, is as laid
down by Holt, who was Lord Chief Justice of Eng-
land in the time of Queen Elizabeth. He says that
if things “are of a tame nature there must be notice
of the ill quality, and the Law takes notice that a
dog is not of a fierce nature, but rather the con-
trary, and the presumption will be against the plain-
tiff, for can it be imagined a man would keep a
fierce dog in his family wittingly! Scienter is the
git of these actions, since it may but be an acci-
dental fierceness. Else suppose it were a fierceness
innate, and the dog had been given to the owner but
an hour before, shall he take notice of all the quali-
ties of his dog at his peril, or shall he have his action
against the giver for bestowing him a naughty dog.”
But the law gives no such right of action against a
father-in-law, because it holds that every husband
takes every wife with notice of her “fierceness
innate”; and, as Hale put it in his Pleas of the
Crown, a man is liable in respect of “a beast that
is ferae naturae, as a lion, a bear, a wolf, yea an ape
or a monkey, and if he get loose and do harm to
any person, the owner is liable to an action for the
damage.” This liability with wives as with wild
things is a continuing one until some other person
has assumed the dominium, at which point the lia-
bility for future accidents will be transferred to the
new dominus.
But it was reseived for N. S. Wales, with its mon-
strous Dog and Goat Act, to fling the last and bitter-
est insult at woman by creating a distinction of an
invidious sort between wives and “the dumb com-
panions of their daily round.” It was given as an
excuse that this was “an Act for abating the nuisance
occasioned by the great numbers of dogs which are
loose in the streets of Sydney, Parramatta, Liverpool
and Windsor.” The only respect in which a wife
has the better of it under this statute is that she is
not liable to be seized and killed if she is found in
the street unregistered and without a collar. On the
other hand, “Dogs or Goats are not to be used for
the purposes of draught,” that is to say, of “draw-
ing any cart, carriage, truck or barrow.” The law
which protects the Dog and Goat allows the cow-
cocky to sweat his wife as he pleases, and to use her
as the oxen—Sundays included. Did the N. S. Wales
Parliament bother its head about the daily duties of
the wife of the cow-cocky? Not much! Nor is it
likely to do so while the law maintains its present
outlook as regards woman.

The Cravens.
A tremendous advance is noticeable in Aus-
tralia since The Bulletin screwed up
its courage seven years ago and handled the
question of attacking syphilis. A few days
back one of the best-known scientists in S.
Australia advocated compulsory notification
as frankly as though he had been discussing
measles. The Age and the Argus, the S.
M. Herald and the Sydney Telegraph have
begun to write about syphilis without any
of the old ridiculous periphrases. The
Federal Government has done all it can
in the direction of reform by ukasing that
fresh arrivals at the different ports shall
be examined by the Quarantine authorities
for venerea] complaints, and if found to be
infected shall be segregated as though they
had small-pox or the plague. In some re-
spects—notably in the matter of that open
discussion which is so good for the health
—Australia stands to-day ahead of the
world, so far as its attitude towards this
abominable affliction is concerned. It would
take its place as the most useful sort of sani-
tary pioneer, but for the currish conduct of
the office-hungry State Ministries. The
State Health Ministers know well that com-
pulsory notification is the only effective
weapon against venereal disease. Not
compulsory notification for criminals and
prostitutes, which was instituted with excel-
lent though necessarily limited results by
C. G. Wade, of N, S. Wales, in his Pris-
oners’ Detention Act. Nor yet compulsory
notification for members of the Expedition-
ary forces. But compulsory notification for
everybody, from the millionaire down to the
park loafer. Of all the States N. S. Wales
has done most to repress syphilis. Yet how
miserably little it has done when one ana-
lyses the position! A venereal clinic has
been established at the Prince Alfred Hos-
pital, Sydney. The Health Minister visited
it the other day; and then this was printed :
He was shocked and horrified at the extent of the
suffering he saw. Last week 1150 visits had been
made, and the week before 1120. The accommoda-
tion was inadequate. If two other clinics were
established, one at the Sydney Hospital and the
other at (say) Paddington, the flow to the Prince
Alfred would not be diminished. The hospital
needed an entirely new ward, not only for
outdoor but for indoor patients, especially women
and children. Beds for SO to 50 children would be
needed.
Meanwhile the Government is not establish-
ing more clinics in Sydney ; and it is estab-
lishing none at all outside Sydney. As
regards the question of compulsory notifica-
tion —admittedly the only means of grappling
with this horror on the grand scale —it un-
ashamedly intends to do nothing. And, as
has been already remarked, the attitude of
the other States is even less admirable.
Here is the astonishing position. The
community is cherishing in its midst a
disease which is more dreadful than most
of the notifiable complaints, and as dreadful,
-when all is said and done, as the deadliest
of them. The public has been press-edu-
cated into an appreciation of the danger.
Every decent citizen who has the alleviation
of misery at heart is prepared for any rea-
sonable sacrifice in the cause. A few Tory
doctors, and what may be termed “the syphi-
litic vote” are alone hostile. These people-
agree that malefactors and prostitutes and!
private soldiers should be forced to undergo,
treatment; but they argue that the well-to-
do classes are different. And the wonder of
it is that they can find so-called Labor Gov-
ernments, in every State, to side with them.
, «.
Okchard, M.H.R., who represents that part
of N. S. Wales, told the House last week
that the Germans in the concentration camp
near Liverpool were vastly better looked
after than the good Australians who are in
the training camp. The truth is that if the
two lots were equally well looked after in the
matter of clothing and food, the Germans,
on the healthy, open undulations of Holds-
worthy would still be infinitely better off than
the Australians on the damp, foggy, flat river
bank at Liverpool. Again and again, while
trying not to make a commotion about it,
The Bulletin has indicated that the camp
was in a most unsatisfactory state. As this
paper said recently, the one point in favor of
the Liverpool site is that it ought to be easily
subject to most thorough control so far as
ingress and egress is concerned, since the
only way to and from the city is by a bridge.
But the discipline is so lax that even this
point in its favor is ruled out. That men
are refused leave and simply take it may be
serious enough from the soldier’s point of
view, though the greater fault may lie
with those who refuse leave foolishly. An
enormously more serious matter is that the
health of the camp has suffered, and, no
doubt, is suffering still, from the fact that
women who never ought to be allowed within
a mile of a mob of healthy young men have
been permitted to hang around and pollute
it. These things have been said before as
delicately as possible; but here, as in Eng-
land, it seems necessary to howl into the ear
of authority before it will take notice. And.
if it does take notice it mostly refers the-
matter to the person who is responsible for-
the mess.
♦
The war may last for years. Philanthropy;,
by means of public cadging, is effective-
enough when the community is keyed up to.
a high pitch by great and unwon ed events..
But such enthusiasm does not last. When*
the sensational charges are over the average-
citizen starts to think about something else-.
Yet the country’s defenders continue to get
killed and maimed, and to need, on behalf of
themselves or their dependents, all the help
that can be given them. If the State relies
on Australia Hays and the like it will be
doing a dreadful wrong to its soldiers. Let
it be granted that the Federal pension, gen-
erous as it is, is inadequate in many cases;
and let it be further granted that the State
has no hope of doing a fair thing by the
men out of ordinary revenue. Then the
money must be raised in some other way.
The tote is the most obvious. A line as to
the resources of a speculative State like
N. S. Wales may be got from the recently-
advertised fact that a local bookmaker, who
claims to give the longest odds in the busi-
ness, can pass £550 rings over city bars in
a casual manner. Add together the in-
comes of all these gaudy members of the
leisured classes and put to that the annual
amount which they would yield to the State
if they were forced to take to productive
work, and a rough idea may be obtained of
the money the Governments of the two
most populous States are sacrificing by
refusal to adopt the totalisator. In Paris
the hospitals and the roads are paid for in
great part out of portion of the pari-mutuel
dividends. If the tote were instituted all
over N. S. Wales and Victoria and the
whole income allocated to a Wounded Sol-
diers’ Fund, there would be little need for
anyone to worry as to the future of the
wounded heroes and those whom they have
left behind. But if anything of the "sort is
to be done it must be done soon. Our men
are falling at the rate of about 200 per day,
and casualties on that scale call for more
than spasmodic orgies of street begging.
“Two Seas” : All through N. S. Wales
there are men looking for a chance to buy
fodder for starving stock, and in some dis-
tricts there are men with fodder to sell. But.

keeps buyers and sellers apart; and the
one who curses the law most' is the/man it.
was designed to assist—the buyer.. Those
deals that are completed are mb&tly the-
result of buyers and sellers entering into a
conspiracy to evade the law. Scarcely a
ton lias been sold in the eountry at the pro-
claimed price. Holders won’t sell, and!
would-be buyers don’t expect them to sell,
below value; buyers therefore, grown des-
perate, are offering sub rdsa- up to £l2, and
in some cases £l4 per ton. Farmers and
graziers,,, who are short of feed and want
enough fodder to carry them over the next
month or two, are quite willing to pay what
the chaff is worth to them. But the deal
can only be completed by bqth parties
becoming lawbreakers; and since many
holders won’t take that risk they hang bn
to their stacks, and the would-be buyer has
to go home unsatisfied —go home to see his
horses sink of starvation, killed by a couple
of city lawyers who know as little of
economics as they do of agriculture.

BRITISH TO THE BACKBONE .
Spurred on by his victories over merchant-
men, Von Tirpitz seems to have last week
decided on giving his men a trial run
against bigger game, and boldly despatched
a German fleet up the Baltic. After being
badly mauled by the Bear, the survivors
bolted home for repairs prior to making
further attacks on fishing smacks and sweep-
ing the British Navy off the face of the
earth. The regularity with which the Hun
warship scuttles from the open sea, to hide
behind minefields and go into dock, is so far
only equalled by the determination of the
submarine pirates to sit on the ocean floor
when anything that can hit back happens to
be lurking on the face of the water above.
The struggle in the eastern section of the
land disturbance looks no more cheerful as
the weeks go by. The Russians are being
steadily pressed backward, and, though far
from beaten, have suffered a sequence of
serious reverses. The enemy have evidently
brought enormous forces to bear upon this
theatre, the intention apparently being to
inflict a smashing blow before the opening
of the Dardanelles permits the passage of
munitions and equipment to the armies of
the Czar. Their relative success in this
operation, combined with the situation re-
vealed after all the desperate fighting of
recent months in France and Belgium,
heavily discounts any idea that the Hun is
near the end of his tether. His prospects
of walloping the Allies grow more remote
with every passing month; but the job of
dressing him down and sitting on the
Turk’s head is a mighty long way
from the stage at which it will be a
fair thing to knock off for a smoke.
Cabled reports of recent debates in the
British Parliament make it clear that there
is an almost national revolt against the dope
to which the people have been treated. The
campaign in Gallipoli, for instance, is going
on behind a veil which may conceal from the
public gaze a fight that is being success-
fully prosecuted, or one that is being as
hopelessly muddled in execution as it cer-
tainly was bungled in original conception.
Yet Australia knows nothing about it—-
except that there are terrible casualties,
that the sunsets are occasionally of majestic
beauty, and that the Queen Elizabeth’s guns
make appropriate thunder. Nor does Aus-
tralia know anything about even the hos-
pital management. The yarn about all this
haze and obscurity being necessary in order
that the enemy may be kept in a state of
ignorance broke down long ago before reali-
sation of the obvious fact that the enemy
has first-hand knowledge of the very things
people in this part of the world are stub-
bornly denied any useful information about.
The position to-day in Flanders and Gali-
cia ; the revelations that have been made of
miscalculation and confessed ineptitude;
the frenzied, eleventh-hour awakening to
danger and obligation—these are sinister
commentaries on the theory that the
“national safety” demands, as a preliminary,
the wholesale gagging and blindfolding of
the community.
“Clew-lin’ ” goes on the other tack
Captain Norton, who writes about “an error of
judgment” (B. 1/7/T5), is as hopelessly wrong as
the master of the Wolstonholme was in going to
starboard instead of to port. If a surgeon is called
on to amputate a man’s left leg and cuts off his right
leg instead —if a physician treats a patient for the
typhoid he hasn’t got instead of for the meningitis
he has—then the bungling muddler can be proceeded
against for damages, can be called upon to show
cause why he should not be struck off the register
of practitioners, and even made the accused on an
indictment for manslaughter. He can be called as
a witness in any proceeding except the criminal trial
—just like the shipmaster—and under pain of severe
penalties be made to answer questions and submit to
cross-examination. To ask: “Who ever heard of a
Judge being suspended when one of his judgments
had been declared erroneous?” is beside the point.
A Judge is not dealing with an exact science, but is
groping in a maze of complexities. But if a Judge
gave a judgment which shook Justice, which made
wreck of Law, he could be impeached and driven from
the Bench he had disgraced. Shipmasters are not ill-
treated. Many who have behaved with gross reck-
lessness have been very leniently handled, and it is
not improbable that Capt. Norton may know of cases
like this. Has he, by the way, ever heard of a ship-
master being quietly relieved of a command by his
employers for doing something which, if officially
known, would have justly merited cancellation of his
ticket? And of this individual going forth with an
unsmirched certificate to get another ship and
promptly pile her up?
Stuart Robertson dragged the Governor’s
speech of four years ago into the debate on
the Address-in-Ileply in the N.SAV. Assem-
bly, and read it out so that members could
remember the promises that Holman had
failed to keep. It was a long performance.
If the huge and ponderous Robertson had
merely mentioned the promises that Holman
had kept lie would have saved a lot of time.
Not that time matters much, perhaps. The
chances are it would have been taken up by
the eloquent young man in making another
crate of equally fragile promises.

The Moffats revived “Bunty” at the Syd-
ney Palace on Saturday night. Jean Clyde
played Bunty, and no one could have been
more alluring, and managing, and canny,
and generally Scawtch. The author and his
wife reproduced their flawless sketches of
middle-aged, middle-class Caledonians, and
the Weelum Sprunt of David Urquhart was
the same old gem. The fascination of this
sliow_ is that it isn’t like a show. It is like
viewing real people saying and doing just
those things which they would be liable to
say and do. Bunty will depart on Friday,
giving place to “The Strollers.”
* *
“The Marriage Market,” the musical
comedy which arrived at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) on Saturday, is the customary
high-cla,ss vaudeville show. For purposes
of scenic effect, the turns transpire in Cali-
fornia and on board a yacht. The plot—-
but why detract from the almost painful
thrill originality of it by an untimely
disclosure ? There are two new girls, both
importations and both very nice. Miss
Ethel Cadman has a high soprano of sympa-
thetic quality, and one of her numbers —
“My Boy”—-stirred the rather apathetic
house to mild approval. Miss Thelma
Raye has a soubrette role, which she fills
adequately. Derek Hudson, who specialises
in the dashing and flamboyant manner, has
a part that suits him down to the ground.
There are moments when he is bold and
naughty enough to impress the most cynical
of ladies’ seminaries; and his singing is
admirable. But the palm and the laurel
wreath and the largest box of sweets all go
to Leslie Holland, who is Lord Hurling-
ham. Not that he supplies anything new.
His lord is the same incredible nobleman
whom trusting remittance-men ape super-
ficially, under the delusion that it is the
real thing. His charm lies in the magni-
ficence of his costumes, the completeness of
his imbecility, his weird lack of resemblance
to a human being. Phil Smith is the sort
of valet that such a peer might have, assum-
ing it were possible for the latter to exist.
Maggie Dickenson, Jack Ralston, Addie
Lennard and Harry Burgess are all good.
So is the chorus.

The Sydney Repertory Society’s produc-
tion of Stanley Houghton’s “Hindle
Wakes,” for three nights last week,
was a remarkable artistic success. With
the exception of Gerald Souper and
Frederick Ward, the cast was purely
amateur, yet the performance and the
characterisation was up to the best profes-
sional standard. Part of this success was
doubtless due to the character of the play;
an equal part must be ascribed to the pro-
ducer, Frederick Ward.

Alan Jeffcote took Fanny Hawthorne,
the upstanding daughter of a weaver in his
father’s Lancashire mill, for a week-end at
the usual hotel. The secret is discovered
in a highly dramatic fashion by Fanny’s
parents upon her return. Alan’s father, a
stern, upright man, is appealed to by
Fanny’s father to do the right thing; and
though it means the ruin of Nathaniel’s
hopes, he determines that his son must
“make an honest woman” of Fanny by
marrying her. Alan revolts. He is en-
gaged to Beatrice Ferrar and loves her.
He explains that he took Fanny away “for
a lark.” He pleads to Beatrice for forgive-
ness for his lapse. But Beatrice comes to
the conclusion that Alan belongs to Fanny,
and releases him from his engagement. So
the parents of both families settle the mat-
ter. But all through Fanny has not been
consulted ; and when the marriage arrange-
ments are being settled, she speaks up. To
Alan she explains that she, too, went away
with him “for a lark.” She thoroughly en-
joyed herself, but as for marrying him, that
was not at all her idea. For one thing,
she didn’t love him. So the whole trouble
is settled on common-sense lines, and Alan
can go off and make, it up with Beatrice.
It is not necessary to praise the indi-
vidual members of the cast; for the per-
formance was so even that one forgot there
were individual members. From Gerald
Souper’s study of Nathaniel H. Jeffcote
and Eveline Douglas’s almost painfully real
conception of the mill-girl, down to Nellie
Romer, who played a maid-servant, all con-
tributed to the artistic effect. The sole weak-
ness was that of Nan Reay, whose failure
to express the self-sacrificing love of Bea-
trice was noticeable only against the excel-
lence of her background.
All that this critic can remember of “The
Law of the Land,” at Sydney Criterion, is
that one scene has a charming “cubist” set-
ting, that Lincoln Plumer discovers the face
at the window or the widow’s mite or some-
thing, and that Muriel Starr suffers mental
agony for several acts. The fault may be
either in the critic’s memory or in the
beautiful lack of originality in this U.S.
melodrama.

Tiie Bulletin puts a mourning band

“The Wrong Mr. Wright” (who is really
Mr. George Willoughby) will start on a
mirth-making campaign on Saturday night
at the Little Theatre (Sydney). The sea-
son will see a revival of some of the old
farce-comedies that Willoughby rollicked in,
such as “What Happened to Jones” and
“Why Smith Left Home.” Prices as usual,
and no questions asked. By request, no
German spies.

“Mary Latimer- —Nun” retires from Sydney
Adelphi to-morrow night without adding to
her score, but with large-sized suspicions
that she has added to George Marlow’s. “A
Girl’s Good .Luck,” which might or might
not be a topical bellowdrama, fills the bill
for Saturday. The Adelphi in its modesty
labels it “a phenomenal London success.”

As a monologuist, Jimmy Britt, ex-liglit-
weight champion pug., is prime goods. But
The Bulletin is inclined to think his pugil-
istic days are over. If they are not, one or
two others on the Tivoli bill will probably
be killed this week. There’s a Yankee com-
edienne, for example—she simply yells for
dark deeds. General Pisano, the sharp-shoot-
ing marvel, is on the bill, too. The Bul-
letin can’t conceive of the lady being
allowed to live for more than one day with
two such dealers of sudden death handy.
Jarvis and Dare provide a good musical
turn that is too much Jarvis and not enough
Dare; and the Tyrells are responsible for a
fine exhibition of modern catch-as-catcli-can
dancing.

The Belgian Band, which the Taits are
leading through Australia without fee, has
been making excellent music at a series of
boil-the-billy concerts in the Sydney Town
Hall. Anyway, if you can’t exactly boil the
billy you can have a smoke—except in a
few small parts reserved for Elijah Dowie
and those who will hold no conversation
with the stinkpot. The band —of 30 or
thereabouts, some of them battle-scarred —
has the support of two singers and a pianist
and a violinist; so there is infinite variety
for the money, and the money is cut up
between the Belgian and Australian relief
funds.
“HINDLE WAKES,” AT SYDNEY
REPERTORY THEATRE.
Sir Sidewhiskers Ferrar (F. Robert Forster).
Jeffcote (G. K. Souper) and young
Jeff cote (Frederick Ward).
“The Girl on the Film,” which brought the
J.C.W. Musical Comedy Co. back to Mel-
bourne and Her Majesty’s, is one of those
stories wherein the crudely grotesque is
asked to run in double harness with the sol-
emnly sentimental. Florence Vie, the pro-
prietress of a successful film factory and
picture show, is broadly extravagant in the
simplest of old-fashioned ways ; Field Fisher,
as a film knockabout actor with inane aspira-
tions to play heroic parts, wears the red-
blobbed cheeks and putty nose of a panto
scarecrow; and the pink patch on the seat
of W. 11. Rawlins, an addle-pated miller,
suggests circuses and sawdust. Dorothy
Brunton is the romantic heroine, sometime
garbed as an unconvincing boy for the pur-
pose of becoming acquainted with Workman,
the alleged genius of the cinema show afore-
said. Daisy Yates is a straw-colored secre-
tary to Workman, in love with Paul Plunket,
their passion being expressed in song-and-
dance whenever they assemble and meet
together. Marie Eaton is an extraordinary
Italian cinema actress who talks foreign
language, sings with the piercing shrillness of
a steam whistle, and is least incredible when
she indignantly chucks up the job. Millie
Engler and Alfred Frith are the haughty
parents of the romantic heroine. Miss Engler’s
quiet performance of a perfectly straight
part is, as it were, the carriage pole that
divides the double-harnessed elements, and
the chorus counts for the ramshackle vehicle
that gets pulled along. Incidental to the
entertainment is a brief cinema show on the
stage, in which the leading principals can see
themselves reflected.
“BUNTY PULLS THE STRINGS,” AT
SYDNEY PALACE.
Tammas Big gar (Graham. Moffat) proposes
to Eelen Dunlop (Mrs. Graham Aloffat).
The grotesqueness of the fooling in “The
Girl on the Film” seemed funny to many
people last Saturday night; but to those who
have lost their early appetite for elementary
humor it was mostly wearisome. Also they
jibbed at the idea of Dorothy Brunton get-
ting “dead struck” on the Max Daly of C. H,
Workman, for his style at any given point
leaves no clue as to whether he was taking
his colorless character seriously, or treating
it as a sorry jest. The pretty little lady is
a popular pink-and-white heroine both in
pants and skirts, though her charm is rather
tinselled, and her range of facial play
limited, and her stage disposition too restless.
Her small voice has delightful sweetness in
“The Mill” ditty, and she scores heavily, of
course, with the familiar recruiting song in
the third act, when a number of chorus
charmers assist to make all the unenlisted
young men in the audience feel horribly con-
scious of the truth about themselves. Miss
Yates makes a favorable first impression with
her willowy grace and dainty insipidity, and
several other people make much the same
impressions as before.

At the Royal (Melb.) they are withdraw-
ing the German Spy melodrama to-night to
make way for the Yiddisher play of “Potash
and Perlmutter.” Five new people from
America are appearing in “P. and P.,” and
the advt. claims that nothing like it has been
staged in Australia thus far. Saturday
brings the revelation.

This is the very last lap of William
Anderson’s long course at Melbourne King’s,
and he is running it out with “The Confes-
sion.” H. R. Roberts, as before, wears the
halo of the priest who knows which man
ought to be hanged, but mustn’t tell, and
Redgrave is the brother who nearly comes
to an undeserved end through reckless in-
dulgence in drink. Practically “The Con-
fession” is an advt. for the new Incensing
Act which started operations on Tuesday
morning. Next week the King’s will be
closed until Saturday (17th), when the Bert
Bailey Co. opens once again in “On Our
Selection.”

At Melbourne Princess’s this week George
Cross is a lad fra’ Lancashire with “The
Heart of a Hero” beating in his breast.
George has a dishonored sister on his mind,
and lumbers about in absurd sea boots
threatening retribution on the author of her

necessary to remove suspicion from his
relative and to save the neck ot another
female who has been incorrectly charged
with the crime and is spending a soiled
existence in the county gaol. When she
escapes George surrenders himself to just ice,
but later bolts for freedom and becomes a
day boarder in a secret crypt beneath the
villain’s dining-room. This unaccountable
lapse from an heroic attitude is not ex-
plained in the subsequent clean-up, but is
presumably shoved in to give a further twist
to a narrative that has already followed the
tcrtuous course of a boa-constrictor which
has had green apricots for breakfast.
Despite his limited self-sacrifice, however,
George is a satisfactory Lancashire hero.
He is quite lifelike in such words as
“maister” and “feyther,” and makes a meal
of “nowt” and “summat,” while he darkens
his eyes to a forbidding twilight to show
the effect of suffering on a sensitive soul.
Miss Remee dodges the rope as sister Nell,
and Fred Kehoe is the assassin of her young
affections whose murder she eventually tries
to expiate by charing for his wicked brother
Wilfrid. This miscreant (Herbert Linden)
is the will-embezzler, forger, murder-mer-
chant and general seducer who carries on
his various trades with a hollow laugh and
lemon-colored gloves. Next Saturday the
same villain will probably find further scope
for Lis bloodthirstiness in a new sensation,
“A Daughter of Israel.”

Clemons and Dean, a songandance
couple of Yankee nationality, are now at
Melbourne Tivoli. The gent, shines as an
eccentric dancer with a gait upset by numer-
ous cocktails, while the lady’s great success
is in her beautiful and well-ventilated
clothes. A “Monkey Music Hall” provides
a quaint burlesque of a vaudeville show;
Louis Stone, an upside-down dancer, adds a
pair of noisy feet to the general proceedings ;
and an impassive conjurer named Galvin is
mainly notable for his criminal waste of eggs.
Robert Parker, billed for a week, was to
have concluded his engagement last night.
A somewhat tired use of his big voice made
Robert only a middling success as a vaude-
ville artist.

At the Adelaide Tivoli Brandon Cremer
gave the strongly-dramatic “Dean Maitland”
for a week, and had the patronage
of a bishop, but has now slumped
(artistically speaking) with “Married to the
"THE HEART OF A HERO.” AT
MELBOURNE PRINCESS’S.
She shoots her And then says, '‘Speak
lover- to me, Mark! It’s
me, Nell.”
Wrong Man,” which gets better acting than
it deserves. Picture shows also are strongly
dramatic, Wondergraph with “The Call of
the North.” and West’s with “Paid in Full.”
At the King’s the hard-working Bletsoes
keep the show lively with a slap-dash “Sana-
torium” burlesque. Zoli. whom some find
attractive, has reappeared, and the balancing
of Toulouse is the brightest single item. The
Steele-Paynes at the Town Hall have some
good mixed turns, but music is their best line,
and the large instruments they saw or ham-
mer are a quaint extra feature. The Royal
lias had a week of Armies at War films.
No photographer earned a Y.C. for taking
them. Still, there are moments of thrill.
“T. 0.1.” : “Teddy” McLean, who died last
week at 75, was a Dublin native who came
to Sydney with his family in 1860. The
father was a silversmith, and in the ’7o’s the
son was his partner. Long considered a
clever amateur dancer, “Teddy” became a
pro. about 1873, and appeared in many har-
lequinades. He organised a troop of juven-
iles, out of which he made cash. But his
best performers were “the Australian Dar-
tos,” his own youngsters, with whom he
simply coined money. Being careful of
what he did make, “Teddy” died the owner
of two terraces which any well-to-do police-
man might envy.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Wallace Brownlow, the baritone who
filled a large space in comic opera in Aus-
tralasia at one time, is returning to the
stage and the concert platform. The war
knocked the bottom out of the copra busi-
ness ; and, anyway, the tropical islands of
reality are an unsatisfying thing to a man
who has tripped and sung amongst the palms
and orange groves of the stage. Still, Brown-
low might have stuck to the new line but for
a bad leg; some timber fell on his foot in
February last, and the limb is in need of a
cool climate, or something.
“Norbell”: Temple Harrison (real name
Longbottom ), who recently made his final
exit, had romantic yearnings in his younger
days. Like most low comedians he aspired
to yearn as Romeo. Also, he used to write
verse. I was chums with him years ago
when touring with a dramatic show, and on
the trip Temple (small and slim in those
days) conceived a passion for our largest and
most massive lady. But his honest love was
spurned, and in revenge Temple wrote a
scathing pome dealing with the lady’s amours.
We were all staying at a big hash-turret in
Newcastle (N.S.W.", and on Sunday night
the landlady had an “evening” in the draw-
ing-room. Temple was asked to oblige. He
obliged by reciting his verses. To be fair, he
thought the lady was out of the house; but
at the right dramatic moment she sailed in
and became the most interested audience
Temple ever had in all his life. Her applause
broke uu the pleasant little party, I remem-
ber.
“Haresfoot” : Temple Harrison’s fatal ail-
ment came through the habitual forcing of
his voice—something analogous to “clergy-
man’s sore throat,” entirely the outcome of
false intonation. Melba spoke on a recent
occasion at the Melbourne Conservatorium
on this peril. Even the magnificent basso
Parker endangers his mighty organ through
forcing it to produce thunderclaps. The
connoisseurs don’t relish them, but the pub-
lic is astounded. Many fine actors have weak
voices which have to be trickily developed.
Bob Brough cultivated a sort of bass from
the chest, which we always felt to be not
exactly his own. A finer natural voice than
Brooke’s, in his younger time, was never
heard on the stage. Forrest thought he had
the grandest voice on the boards ; but Brooke,
as iago, just for sport, rose above all Forrest
could do. as Othello, in the great Third Act
scene. Sullivan had a poor thing, developed
with a sort of perpetual rise and fall, in
rhythm. Irving imitated it, though his
natural voice was better than Sullivan’s, and
he owned vastly more magnetism and elec-
tricity.
“Q.” : London managers are being hard
pressed these days, so Tree, with his back to
the wall, puts up a fine, ripe bellow: “The
Right to Kill.” The thing is an adaptation
from the French, but is no more French in
conception or treatment than it is Senegam-
bian. Just a plain, blunt horror about a
husband instigating the seduction of his wife,
of the discovery of the plot and of the hus-
band being butchered. It looks like some-
thing fit for mere Australians.
“0.K.”: The Bulletin said that Ida
Barr, of the Tivoli, should wear long black
gloves instead of white; and Ida replies that
the blame rests not with her, but with the
shops. Ida knows that she ought to wear
black gloves. She wore no other in England,
and if she’d known she was coming to a
country where she couldn’t get her size in
“long blacks,” she’d have brought a few with
her. The lady stands about 6ft. high, and
has limbs in proportion; and she makes
severe comments on the idea of importing
an out-size in vaudeville song-ladies to a
country that hasn’t got gloves to fit her.
The Bulletin’s comment was the last
straw. It added exasperation to annoyance.
It was crossing the Barr, so to speak.
“Stargazer”: Actor folk are notoriously
superstitious. I was one of a party, mostly
actors, discussing the death of a recent
comedian. A brother Thespian, financially
depressed, and harboring a great thirst,
opined that the late lamented was better
off, poor devil. “Better off?” gasped the
almost eminent Shakspearian pro. “Better
off ? Why, you d —n fool, he died on a
Friday!”
"C. Ockney” : To those who, like myself,
remember the wild, tumultuous enthusiasm
of the “de Reszke nights” at Covent Garden,
when the Poles of great price, the brothers
Jean and Edouard de Reszke, perfect singers
and very personable men, were in their glory,
it comes as a cruel shock to read a letter
recently received by the American Polish
Relief Committee in New York. The letter
is from Edouard de Reszke, the once-idolised
basso, briefly reporting that his estate
at Gafnesk, in Poland, has been utterly de-
stroyed, and the whole region laid waste.
He is now living in a cellar with the Prince
and Princess Lukouirski- They are desti-
tute fugitives from their devastated property,
without fuel, oil, and almost wanting food !
What a theme for a grand opera. The
greatest Mephistopheles of his day testifies
that war is Hell!

“Q.”: As Australia contracted the musi-
cal-comedy habit quickly, and hadn’t to wait
long for a revue, it is likely to soon catch
the ragtime-play disease. The worst out-
break, “Watch Your Step”—a wild bang of
drums and incoherencies —is hitting Lon-
don hard with jangles and choruses, in which
the public joins roaringly.
THE LATEST DANCE.
[Foe The Bulletin.]
A year ag'O the tigerish Tango tried
To bring the earth beneath its sensuous sway.
Since then the dance has changed ; on every side
The Goose Step dominates the world to-day.
MAORI LAND. MOANA.
(Continued on page 34.)
The most wildly humorous contribution
to the “stop work” campaign for which
“Liberal” politicians are making the war
an excuse came from Victorian Public
Works Minister Hagelthorn. In Geelong
there has lately been a shindy over a pro-
posal to build a new town hall, the opposi-
tion declaring that it would be waste of the
ratepayers’ money. A deputation asked
Hageltliorn to Do Something, and that
statesman rose to the Occasion by writing
to the Geelong Council telling it that it
should be Dashed Well Ashamed of itself
rowing while we are still so far from Tip-
perary, and calling upon it in the name of
the Empire to cease even discussing the
town hall till the war is over. The Council
has not yet recovered from the feeling that
it is a Disloyal Hound, and with the idea
of placing its patriotism beyond question it
is not only going to drop the town hall busi-
ness, but will also cease collecting dog tax
and street manure until the war is at an
end.
David Low, who has bailed up more
politicians, Judges and Governors with
a pencil and bristol-board than any
other Australian artist, and has done
most of it in the name of The
Bulletin, will next month throw a collec-
tion of 400 or so at the public in book
form. The public is let off lightly in being
requested to throw one guinea at Low in
return. The edition is limited to 250 copies,
autographed by the artist. Tyrrells, of
Sydney, will publish and collect the cash.
J. McGuire, who succeeds McNeil as gen-
eral traffic manager of S. Aus. railways,
joined the service 45 years ago as a clerk,
and has been pushing up ever since. He has
put in his best work thus far in handling
the traffic between the seaboard and the Bar-
rier. A local product by birth and train-
ing, he has not been afraid of nine children.
One of his boys fell in the landing on Gal-
lipoli, another sailed for the Front on the
day news came of his brother’s death, two
others are in camp getting ready for the
fray, and a fifth is a Headquarters clerk at
Keswick.
In the lieps. the other night Ilampson, ot
Bendigo, drew the Prime Minister’s atten-
tion to Bruce Smith’s torrential letter in the
press, charging the Speaker with partisan-
ship, and howling:—
We are standing still as a nation, hand-tied and
tongue-tied, because a knot of men, actuated by the
German International Socialist spirit, who are them-
selves German in spirit, German in their methods
and German in their moral code
“Well,” said Fisher, “the letter has been
twice mentioned to me, but I have not read
it, nor do I intend to.” They throw old
boots at Spruce nowadays, in a manner of
speaking.
Thomas Curnow, who has just retired
from the Vic. Education Department, after
residing in Ballarat for over 30 years, was
the schoolmaster at Glenrowan in the days
of the Kelly gang. He was the young man
who, on the night the bushrangers removed
portion of the railway line near Glenrowan,
hoping to wreck the police train from Mel-
bourne, discovered what they had done, and
running along the permanent way managed
to stop the train by using a danger signal
improvised from a red handkerchief and a
match. The Government promptly rewarded
him with promotion, and at the same time
decided that he might live longer if he lived
somewhere else.
“W.A.R.” wants sudden death distri-
buted wholesale: —
This fuss about doubling the shifts at the Lith-
gow Rifle Factory seems misplaced. England is
awakening to the fact that the sort of war that is
happening just now can be won soonest by the
machine-gun and the high explosive: yet here we
are still bothering about an out-of-date weapon like
the rifle. This is the age of machinery,- not of the
manual laborer. Instead of sending masses of men,
each man handicapped by a rifle, we should be send-
ing masses of machinery. Three machine-guns can
pour out a fiercer fire than a company of men armed
with the obsolete and hand-worked rifle. No doubt,
masses of human flesh are still required for storm-
ing positions; but there is no reason why these in-
dispensables should be encumbered with such a clumsy
and footling thing as a rifle. Give them their en-
trenching tools, to enable the machine-guns to be
placed in safe positions ; give them revolvers for in-
dividual defence; give them some sort of bayonet.
But don’t ask them individually to carry cartridges
and a machine that fires off one compliment at a
time, when the business of firing compliments can be
done so much more efficiently and rapidly by
machines. Doubtless a few sharp-shooters will still
be required for service with the machine-guns; but
give those sharp-shooters a rifle with the latest sights,
as much in advance of the sighting of the service
rifle as the machine-gun is in advance of the rifle
itself. Three shifts should certainly be worked at
Lithgow ; but those three shifts should be engaged in
turning out machine-guns. A machine-gun has been
invented in Australia, the specifications of which need
not be asked for from England. Our Defence
Department has tested it; and the reports indicate
that it is an immense improvement. The objection
that confusion is caused by the use of two or more
patterns of the same arm need not apply here: the
Australian force is a distinct unit. Surely it should
use the latest invention of Australian brains, manu-
factured by Australians in Australia?
Dead at last, Porfirio Diaz, ex-President
of Mexico —an iron-handed old tyrant who
did a lot for his country. Among other
things he saved it from bankruptcy, and,
for a time, from anarchy. But Diaz had a
mania for Foreign Capital, and it was that
active beast which at last drove Mexico to
the pit it is now struggling in.
Benjamin Baxter, who died at Frankston
last week, was intimately connected with
the beginning of things in Victoria. His
father, Captain Baxter, reached Melbourne
in ’37, became one of the founders of the
Melbourne Club, and took part (12/11/’3B)
in the first cricket match played in the
colony—at the foot of Batman’s Hill, just
where Spencer-street railway station ’ is.
He was also one of the directors of the
agricultural society founded in Melbourne
in ’4o—the year of his son’s birth —and was
connected with a theatrical performance in
Melbourne as far back as ’42. He was also
the first goldfields commissioner. Mrs. Baxter
was the first post-mistress in Melbourne, and
it was she who shipped the first mails to
London direct. Benjamin Baxter was born
in Batman’s house, where the A.M.P. build-
ing stands, in Collins-street. Subsequently
the family removed to Frankston, taking
up a property known for years as Baxter’s
Flat, the scene of many a country race
meeting in the ’so’s.
Bachelor knight Samuel McCaughey, who
celebrated his 80th birthday recently, has
promised £lOOO a month for 10 months to
the Australian Wounded Fund. Sam is a
North of Ireland man who came to Aus-
tralia in 1856. The first property he
acquired, in conjunction with two partners,
was Coonong, near Tirana. This was in
1860. It comprises 42.000 acres, and is the
only big lump of freehold now in his hands.
The lonely old man’s home is at Yanco,
alongside the irrigation area. In fact, it
was he who started to make it an irrigation
area.
Godfrey Howitt, of Melbourne, has
written his last prescription. He was the
third in line of a famous family of doctors.
Ilis grandfather, also Dr. Godfrey, arrived
in Melbourne during 1840, bringing with
him a cottage ready for erection. This his-
toric dwelling still stands at the east end of
Flinders-lane. Howitt, the explorer, who
went forth to get Burke and Wills out of
their elaborate mess, was a brother of the
old doctor.
THE GODS AND THE FACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Anderson’s long reign at Melbourne King’s comes
to an end with “The Face at the Window,” which is
a classic of its kind....a dear, familiar horror....
Bert Bailey and his partners have obtained a seven-
years’ lease of the King’s. —,“Sundry Shown.”
Although we gods who sft aloft
Ain’t what they’d call white-livered,
You’ve thrilled us to the marrer oft—
Wide-mouthed we’ve sat and shivered.
We loved you! Smarting teardrops tell
Our hearts are full of sorrer;
Farewell old Face, a long farewell,
Dear old familiar horror!
Dials may come and dials go,
Of melodrama’s creatures ;
Yours in the gruesome green-lime glow,
Who can forget your features?
The bonzer harrower of to-day,
But gone, alas ! to-morrer,
Why with us always can’t you stay,
Dear old familiar horror?
Bill Anderson, whate’er your port,
Our blessings on you daily!
The Face must hold some other fort- —
We’ll stay and welcome Bailey;
And, though his phiz, deserves our cheers,
Hard cash we’ll beg or borrer,
Or steal, to see when re-appears
Your old familiar horror.

It looks as though someone has an idea
who the new tenant of Sydney Government

tation now issued by Governor Strickland
no longer bear any printed address indicat-
ing where the junketing is to take place.
For purposes of reply to the invitation the
words “Cranbrook, Rose Bay,” are added by
hand. So his Ex. will not need to have
new forms printed if by any chance he
moves into Tom Henley’s ‘‘baronial hall”

THE THORNS OF OFFICE.

Arthur Robinson mentioned in A'ic. Leg.
Council the other evening that a mining
engineer who had volunteered in Austialia
and been rejected as medically unfit went
to London and got a commission with the
Royal Engineers. Robinson evidently
thought this was a reflection on the selectors
in Australia, but it is much more likely to
simply mean that Australia has bettei

“Fax”: The foulest blot on the existing
system of appeals for patriotic contribu-
tions and charitable gifts
to distressed Belgians, etc.,
is the collection-dodger who
refuses assistance “on prin-
ciple.” He turns down all
applications with the excuse
that he “objects on prin-
ciple” to give voluntarily
what should properly be
wrung from him by the Gov-
ernment. The direct war
taxation, which in his vague,
negative way he professes to
advocate, would madden his
meanness if it were intro-
duced; but as he is in.no
immediate fear of taxation,
he sees no necessity for help-
ing to keep it from coming.
He is a striking object-les-
son on the duty of Govern-
ments to the most conscien-
tious citizens. A Govern-
ment that leaves the care of
the afflicted to individual
consciences is practically
punishing the sentimental
poor for the benefit of the
soulless capitalists who will
part with nothing “on prin-
ciple” that isn’t going to re-
turn good interest. It robs the
patriots to spare the shirkers.
It permits financial fight-
ing forces to be raised in the
same way that its human
fighting forces are raised —
by voluntary enlistment
instead of conscription. In
short, it sticks to British
Ideals, or, rather, British Ideals stick to
it, as the Old Man of the Sea stuck to
Sinbad.
“The Dead Marine”: I’m in the chorus
with the skipper who approved of the pro-
posed change in the character of Macquarie
Light at Sydney Heads. The quick-flash
light is the best. To a seaman making the
land in hazy weather (or any other kind
of weather, for that matter) the fixed light
is the most annoying. This is on account
of the liability of mistaking it for a
steamer’s light or for some shore lamp.
Next to the fixed light, the glow-revolver
(such as Macquarie) is the worst. For one
thing, in taking a compass bearing of it, one
has to wait for a minute before it attains
it-; greatest brilliancy, and while the officer
of the watch is waiting for the minute to
pass his attention is off his job.of keeping a
lookout. For another thing, if the weather
is at all thick the slow-moving light does
not penetrate the murk as the quick-flash
does. About a year ago the s.s. Wear, mak-
ing Sydney Heads on a hazy night, picked
up the lights of a picture palace on Cronulla
and mistook it for Macquarie. The conse-
quence was she went ashore, fortunately
without doing any damage. Had the Mac-
quarie been a flash instead of the “stately
revolving light” it is, that accident would
never have occurred. The practice is now
common all over the world of installing the
quick-flashing apparatus in new light-
houses, and most of the principal maritime
countries are altering the fixed and revolv-
ing lights to flashing lights. The old revolv-
ing light was useful in its day, but its day
is gone, like that other one Herr Sossage
used to skite about.

Bismarck, who moulded the German
Empire, was born on a Friday. That settles

On an appeal against the decision of a
magistrate at Wollongong (N.S.W.). Jus-
tice Harvey has decided that if a man thinks,
rightly or wrongly, that he would be com-
mitting a breach of an award by working
as desired by his boss, he may absent him-
self from toil —in other words, go on strike.
The particular case affected a winding en-
gineer, who, after refusing to leave his
engine and take up firing, was prosecuted
for absenting himself from duty; and on his
successful plea several other cases will be
decided. The judgment puts another nail
in the coffin of the present Arbitration law.
Wages Board awards, like most legal instru-
ments, are often ambiguous, and quite fre-
quently the employees and employers put a
different construction on various clauses.
Apparently in such a case,, if the employers
persist in sticking to their interpretation,
the employees will be justified in absenting
themselves from work on the. plea that, on
their interpretation (even if erroneous),
they would be breaking an award by work-
ing. And the employer, forming any rotten
old conception he likes of an. award, may
presumably lock the men out if they won t
adopt his idea too.
THE STORY OF THE BRISBANE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the tale of a warship, told in sorrowful
tones
Over the thrippenny bar by a man with a name like
Jones;
He was rather a mournful person—a pessimist, too,
I fear —•
With the saving qualification of a catholic taste for
beer.
We met by chance one evening, and he said with a
stifled sob
That the whole world was against him, and he’d
lost an ideal job.
“Yes, Mister’’ —edging towards me —“that job ’d a-
suited you.
Of course, you’ve ’eard of the Brisbane, wot’s buildin’
at Cockatoo ?”
I had, and I said so, promptly; and then in a
friendly strain
I beckoned a darlc-eyed Hebe, who filled up his glass
again.
He dashed the beer to his midriff, wiped his mous-
tache, and then:
“I got a job at Cockatoo Dock in—er —nineteen
’undred and ten.
“Them was the good days, Mister! Things is dead
rotten now;
Wot with the drought, an’ the war, an’ all, I tell
you it’s a cow!
“I was a riveter’s vally, the riveter’s name was
Ben—
A dashed good worker ’e wos, too, in nineteen-
’undred an’ ten!
“I’ve known old Ben do a solid seventeen rivets a
day,
An’ we ’ad '.o ’ustle to fit ’im, the boy an’ me, at
the pay!
“ ’E’s drorin’ ’is pension, Ben is, an’ the boy’s got
married now,
An’ gettin’ a fitter’s wages—w’ile me! Ain’t it just
a cowt”
He gazed in his empty measure with a look of loath-
ing and pain,
So I beckoned the dark-eyed Hebe, who filled it up
again.
“Yes,” he resumed, after thinking, “our job was
right on the slip—
The place w’ere they laid down a crooser—you may
say, a kinder ship.
“They named ’er the crooser Brisbane; leastways,
they will w’en she floats;
An’ the year she wos planned she wos goin’ to be
one o’ the modern boats.
“She’s sister-ship to the Sydney an’ the Melbun they
built on the Clyde;
An’, don’t you fergit it, in years to come she’ll be
torked erbout with pride.”
He paused, and once more I saw in his eyes a look
of pain,
So I beckoned the dark-eyed Hebe, who filled his
glass again.
“I’ll never fergit the mornin’ the Minister laid the
keel—•
It’s well on six years back, now, but there’s some
hours that you feel!
That mornin’ there wos speeches, an’ cheers, an’ real
champagne,
An’ the Minister said our crooser ’d ride on the
stormy main.
“Well, p’raps—p’raps not. ’Oo cares? We’re full
of ’orrors an’ strife,
An’ all I know is that crooser was the bonzer job
o’ me life!
“It was only six months later they found out she
was wrong,
So we scrapped the bloomin’ keel-plates—my oath,
but that was strong!
“An’ then, in the follerin’ April—’old ’ard —now,
wos it May?
No —April! we laid noo keel-plates, but laid ’em
the other way! ;
“A noo young Minister laid ’em—a damn teetotal
bloke,
An’ there wasn’t fizz, or beer, on deck to ease the
Guv’ment stroke.
“But we ’ad whips o’ speeches! But ’earty the cheers
was not—
’Ow the ’ell can a man cheer, Mister, w’en ’e’s
only thirsty an’ ’ot?
“Three or four strikes passed over, an’ the old boss
slung ’is ’ook—•
’E’s got a new job somewhere, but as fer me —well,
look! ”
I noted the old expression of weary, hopeless pain,
So I beckoned the dark-eyed Hebe, who filled ’em
up again.
“It mighter bin two years later,” said Jones (if that
was his name),
“Wien we got a shock at the flamin’ job—they played
a dirty game 1
“They went and sold the outfit; but some o’ the
blokes up top
Gave orders to recommence things, an’ so we ’ad to
stop.
“We chucked out the noo-laid kelson, an’ cut up
the garboard strake,
An’ started again with keel-plates as hard as we
could make!
“The Minister calls again, too; official it was this
time,
An’ drives the first new rivet, an’ says our work was
prime!
“Xex’ year ’is Guv’miuc's outed, but we wos pleased
as Punch —■
We knoo that another Minister ’d soon call round fer
lunch!
“ ’E did —an’ s’ ’elp me, Mister, the bloomin’ Dock
went gay
W’en ’e druv the second rivet in a official way!
“Then come this blasted war, an’ I tell you as a
friend
That some o’ the old ’ands reckoned it meant the
bloomin’ end.
“But we still ’ad a card to play, mate, as we ’ave
w’enever we like,
So some of the rival unions puts up a leetle strike;
“An’ it took some time to settle, an’ then our blokes
weren’t done,
Fer they finds out the Brisbane’s troubles was only
just begun !
“If ever she should be plated, still, see, she couldn’t

’Cos w’y? She’d need a coffer-dam to reach the

, “Last week we finished the rivets, an’ that’s ’ow 1
lost me job ;
But she can’t be launched fer weeks —say, boss, can

I gave him a bob; he beered it, and brought the
tale to a close:
Will the Brisbane float next month—next year—or
never ? The good Lord knows !

MEN’S OUTFITITTEI S,
309 &. 311 George Street, Sydney,
The need for the Foundling Home which
ought to have been established in Sydney
at least a generation ago is to be brought
under the notice of the Government once
more. It is City Coroner Hawkins who is
this time reminding Ministers of a long-
delayed duty, a baby-murder inquest hav-
ing caused him to make remarks. Accord-
ing to the information placed before him,
six infants were murdered in 1913 and
double that number in 1914; while so far
this year 11 new-born Australians have
been done to death —all in the city. More-
over, these are merely the police figures;
and even the police admit that only a few
of- the actual baby murders are discovered.
As for abortionists, a whole tribe practise
their murderous work without any inter-
ference whatever.
OFF AND AWAY.
RUTH: “Her husband is well off."
KATE: “What do you call well off?”
RUTH: “He’s in South America, I believe.”
A new weapon with infernal possibilities is
the aerial torpedo which the Germans are
using with poor results on the eastern Front.
A small dirigible, carrying no crew, it can
be propelled several miles by a compressed-
air motor, and from it a bomb, consisting of
501 b. of gun-cotton in a thin cylinder, can
be released automatically, in much the same
way as time-shrapnel is burst. Ho far the
aerial torpedo has cafwsed practically no
damage, and consequently very little has
been heard of it. Once it has been re-
leased on its journey all control is lost, and
wind may deflect it hundreds of yards from
its objective. An Australian, Albyn J.
Roberts, did much better than that. His
was a wireless-controlled dirigible, to
which, after long delay, the War Office gave
trials a couple of years ago. These were
entirely successful as far as they went; but
the authorities cold-shouldered the invention
because Roberts couldn’t stop outsiders tap-
ping the wireless and so interfering with
his course. Many another man would, in
disgust, have hawked the invention to foreign
Governments; but Roberts knew the value
of his sudden death, and patriotically decided
to reserve his apparatus for the British. So
he returned to Australia to remedy the
defect, and, incidentally, push ahead with a
dozen other inventions; and those who have
seen him steer his models have witnessed
ghastly possibilities. Since the war broke
out he is reported to have pushed his ex-
periments further, and the big invention, in
an improved form, is again under offer.
“Aldwych” (from London) : Those re-
marks about “Hungry Mendicants Who
Wear Aprons” (B. 18/8/’l5) hit a tough
proposition where the Sydney got the
Emden. Just before Christmas I had to
attend a meeting of the Colonial and Con-
tinental Church Society in the Queen’s
Hall. It began and ended with cadge. Among
the mendicants was the Bishop of Nelson
(M.L.), the Archdeacon of Athabasca
(Canada), and a few minor canons. His
gaiters of Nelson (formerly of Echuca, Vic.)
groaned about the rabbit- and drought-
stricken Murray Basin, and spun a harrow-
ing yarn about clouds of ferocious locusts
devouring everything be-
fore them as in the days
t>f Nebuchadnezzar. In-
cidentally his Reverence
mentioned that placid
little Nelson was in a
worse plight even than
Victoria, the pith of his
moan being that M.L.
was too poor to pay for
ten curates and a couple
of whale boats. The man
from Athabasca was
worse with his pathetic
story of seven months
snow and the frost-bitten
rector’s struggle for exist-
ence and Government
seed wheat and all the
rest of it. Athabasca
also wanted curates, and
this was his way of in-
citing the English widow
to subscribe the funds.
It was this lead that
Jack Cormack, sent over
by the late N.S.W. Irri-
gation Commis-
sioner Wade to
preach about the
Murr u m b idgee
farms, had to fol-
low. How he man-
aged to get in
among that crowd
beats me. Perhaps
he suspected what
was going to happen and formed himself into
a bomb. Anyway, the locust yarn was blown
to bits, and the 3000 peonle got
some reliable news from the bush before
they left. But the collection lists weiU
round all the same, and a day or two later
Sadlier, of Nelson, had snared enough cash
to go into the curate market with a dozen
saloon tickets for Maoriland.
* * * *
“Personnel’s” scheme: —
It has become the fashion, if you desire to abstract
the nimble shilling from your neighbor’s pocket for
a patriotic fund, to start the fund yourself by adver-
tising that you are prepared to put up £lOO or so
if 100 others 'will do the same thing. My idea came
to me thiswise. A couple of Saturdays ago I stayed
in town and had lunch. The waiter who brought my
whisky and soda received the sixpence change, and
the young lady who helped me to my lunch got a
shilling. Afterwards, I went to another hotel to
meet a soldier who was very unhappy, poor chap,
because his regiment had left, and he at the moment
of sailing had been put ashore to fill another job.
Three times during the afternoon it came to my turn
to shout. Each shout cost me sixpence for the
waiter. Every round of drinks brought a fresh
waiter, who adroitly always made up the change so
that there was a sixpence pushed away by itself.
It looked so lonely that I had to leave it on the
plate. The drink waiter got a bob out of me at
dinner. He served me more than once, and I had
OFF AND ON.
SHE ( reading ): “ ‘The dresses of the ladies in the harem scene in the new play will he of
universal interest.'”
HE: “A woman’s usual interest —‘What did she have on?’"
SHE: “A man’s usual interest —-‘What did she have off?’”
guests; so he was really better than the fellows
down below. But the man who really broke me up
was the waiter who was kind enough to serve me
and;my guests at the table. When I put a shilling
in his hand I saw him out of the corner of my eye
turning it over. Perhaps he expected a bob each for the
guests—l don’t know. Anyway, he showed it to
another waiter, and was plainly on the hunt for
sympathy and consolation. But I wasn’t finished yet.
A cabman raced with me to catch my train. I
tipped him a bob, for which he said “Thank you,”
although cabbies are not supposed to say “Thank
you.” I did not begrudge that tip. Feed is very
dear just now. Adding* it up, my day cost me 6s. in
tips; and as I lunch in town five days in the week,
and very frequently dine as well, it will be a most
modest estimate if I put' my tips down at 12s. a
week; Now, back to my idea. I will develop
sufficient moral courage to tip no more waiters dur-
ing the war if I can get 100 others to do the same,
and we will devote the proceeds to the Red Cross
Fund. Further, we will appoint a committee to in-
, . ~ ’ . . , , , x ,
terview the managers of the hotels and restaurants
we frequent, and have a box erected in a prominent
place in the room on which will be inscribed “Tips
for Waiters—to the Red Cross Fund.” The waiters
won’t mind. If they do, it doesn’t matter. Their
wages at union rates are good, anyhow. And,
... , . 6 ~ , ’
besides, we want men, and you can t have real men
and tips, too. That’s what’s the matter with the
U.S.A.
“Snell” : “0.K.,” arguing for moderation
in hating our Teutonic foe _ (B. 24/6/T5),
points out that “we do not hate the Chinese
. , , . i , . i ~ ~
we exclude by special legislation.’ O.K.’
misses here a point which turns the argu-
nient against him somewhat. As an Aus-
tralian native of too long standing, I can re-
member when the Chinaman was hated with
such peculiar vindictiveness that Sin Fat
dared not show his nose in many townships,
nor even in the streets of some big towns.
But I’ve lived to see a remarkable change
in Australian public sentiment towards the
Chinaman. After being hated he was toler-
ated, and _ now the general attitude towards
him is quite friendly. How account for this
change? It is due to the fact that the legis-
lation “0.K.” quotes lias robbed the China-
man of his character as a national menace,
Before the introduction of effective restric-
tions he was the Yellow Peril, and was hated
like the Devil. So will the people hate any
race that threatens their security and happi-
ness. This hatred is a form of self-preser-
vation, and the closer the menace the more
virulent the hate. If we hate the Germans
it is because of the instinctive conviction
that they threaten our very existence as a
free people. It is vain to preach against a
hatred that will be essential to our security
for as long as the nations continue to prey
upon one another. To-day loving one’s
enemy is only possible to a degenerate who
has parted with the will to live.

POLITE POTT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I knew a courteous man called Pott,
And kicks and ha’pence were his lot.
A thorough Christian he and meek,
Out of his turn he’d never speak.
He always bowed and stepped aside,
And gave up railway seats with pride.
He never shoved or got in first.
Sooner than shove, he’d die or burst.
He bowed and smiled and seemed aghast
Unless he was the very last.
The world walked over Pott as he
Excused himself effusively.
He knew it treated him like mud ;
But courtesy was in his blood.
So he deferred and begged all to
Precede him with “Thanks —after you l”
“I beg your pardon!” Night and day
Those gentlemanly words he’d say.
“Excuse me!” “Not at all!” “Takemine!”
Long use gave all these gags a shine.
One day a fool discharged a gun —-
And Pott was the unlucky one.
His face death-grey—his coat all red —-
“My fault entirely, sir,” he said.
Then —as the blood gushed from his side —-
“Don’t mention it!” he sobbed, and died.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Hearing the marker call “55,” Charles
Christopher Bowen, Speaker of Maoriland
Leg. Council, has decided to give the
ancients a chance of electing another presi-
dent. Bowen was the first Treasurer of
Canterbury in the old “Executive” days,
was subsequently a magistrate, then went
into Parliament, and remained there for
40-odd years. His real claim to fame is
the authorship of the Act of 1877, never
since amended in any essential part, which
established the national system of free, com-
pulsorv and secular education. Florid, John
Bullish, and a most scholarly speaker, the
line old Tory has not made a personal enemy
in all his long life.
A brilliant young Maorilander passed out
the other day somewhere in France, when
a German bullet found Alan Wallace, of
Auckland, the Rhodes Scholar for 1912.
Wallace’s career was of the kind that make
educationists .speak in breathless awe, and
his athletic record included cricket and
football triumphs of more than local im-
portance. When he graduated in M.L. he
annexed three senior scholarships on the
same run: then he graduated at Oxford
with first-class honors in mathematics,
played in the first 11, and was reading for
more honors when the fire broke out. He
found a place among the Engineers.
GRAHAM, Minister of
Agriculture, N.S.W.
E. F. Waddy, who forsakes a mastership
at the venerable King’s School, Parramatta,
to take up a similar job at Rugby, is a
parson-brother of headmaster P. S. Waddy.
“Mick,” as lie is sportingly labelled, has
played in iutor-State cricket, and generally
is a glutton for exercise between prayers.
Phvsically, he is just the typical thin, wiry
Australian whom the mostly-imported mili-
tary doctors were turning down by the
score a few months ago.
It seems that Lissauer, the Chanter of
Hate, isn’t really the author of his own
wonderful snarl. It was written years ago
by another furious German who was mad
with Prussia, the bully State. The ingeni-
ous Lissauer, who appears to be a mere lar-
cenist, stole the ancient howl out of the back-
numbers of something and substituted “Eng-
land” for “Prussia.”
Old Tom Curran, whose will is being
wrangled over in London, was a typical
“exile of Erin.” He started as a police
constable and wound up as a member of the
British House of Commons. In between lie
had been the most successful Australian
publican of his day. Amongst other achieve-
ments he put Pfalilert’s Hotel in Sydney on
a sound basis. He understood food and
drink. Also he had a gift for spotting the
obvious. In the early ’9o’s the Irish party
was hard up for men with any kind of
cachet. Tom flashed notes to the value of a
brace of seats —one for himself and one for
his son, who was starred in the press of
that day as “the youngest member of the
House of Commons.” Of this son it. is said
by the cables that “he had married an
actress, and thereby incurred his father’s
anger”; but the real cause of trouble_ is
supposed to have been Old Tom’s wife.
Young Tom is a member of the Bar in Syd-
ney and London, and in odd moments de-
livers a lecture entitled “Wit and Humor
of the House of Commons.”
UNTRUE TO LABEL.
Large quantities of barrels, ostensibly containing
beer, on the way from Germany to Turkey, were
detained at Bucharest. On examination they were
found to contain asphyxiating gas bombs. — Cable.
Jovial Turkish Husband (explaining
things to the harem): “ ’Sh all right,
me dears. Met the boys and had pint
of ashphyxiating bub-bub-bomb.”
That John Sidey, of Dunedin (M.L.),
who was mentioned the other day as haying
bequeathed big wads of cash to the Univer-
sity, had a fair slice of luck. On the day
John took out his passage in Scotland for
Otago, he bought 50 acres of rural land, 10
acres of suburban and a town quarter-acre.
When he went ashore to find his quarter-
acre he thought it looked good, so he left, it
alone and went on closing an acquisitive
fist on some more of the same sort. On the
corner of that "quarter-acre now stands the
Grand Hotel; it is about the most valuable
site in Dunedin, and John, steadily piling
one bawbee on top of the other, clung to it
to the end. Son Tom is a lawyer and Lib-
Lab Parliamentarian.
“Vic.”: Died last week, Clark, doyen of
Melbourne architects, and perhaps the most
distinguished in Australia. When only 21,
having been in Government employ from 13
years old, he designed the Melbourne Trea-
sury, and afterwards the Victorian Govern-
ment Printing Office, Custom House, Mint,
and a large number of other State estab-
lishments. A leading morning paper credits
him with Government House and the Law
Courts. But Government House is offict-
allv set down to Wardel], Pugin’s pupil,
architect of St. Pat’s in Melbourne and St.
Mary’s in Sydney. And with regard to that
grandly-symmetrical work, the Law Courts,
it has always been understood that one
Smith, a Government employee, stole a
march on outsiders. Clark would have been
put on to design the Melbourne Public
Offices, but that Premier Francis, of Rich-
mond, had a valuable constituent named
Egan, whose young son, Michael, was given
the job. He did the work excellently, too,
using the foundations long before laid for the
Chief Secretary’s Office by Premier
O’Shanassy, who said the Victorian popu-
lation would be six millions by the opening
of the twentieth century! Clark was ap-
pointed in 1883 Government architect for
Queensland, where he designed the Treasury
buildings and much else. Later he worked
for the Westralian Government, and won
competitions everywhere—for St. Andrew s,
Perth; the Children’s Hospital there; Mel-
bourne City Baths. Carlton Women’s Hos-
pital, Auckland Town Hall. Last of all
he took in hand the new Melbourne Hospital,
and made a trip round the world to view
all the places that should help him. lhe
latest ought to be the best.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” :
Though O. E. Pilcher, K. 0., is the oldest N.S.W.
barrister in practice (B. 1/7/Y5), there are four
others who are his seniors—ex-Justices Matthew
Henry Stephen (1850) and G. B. Simpson (1858),
and H. C. Dangar and W. A. Long, who were
“called” in London, and never took a brief.
Among the few married men who volun-
teered in the earliest stages of the war, one
of the promptest was Captain C. R. Lowe,
who hastily left to a locum tenens the man-
agement of the Armadale (Vic.) branch of
the Savings Bank, lost no time in getting
severely wounded at the Dardanelles, and
at latest advices had been put aboard ship
for England, covered with enough glory to
last any reasonable bank-manager and wife
for their lifetime.
Private Albert Cramer, of Fitzroy (Vic.),
reported killed at the Dardanelles, is, it is
to be hoped, the youngest of the victims. lie
Was only fifteen. Determined to take
part in the scuffle, the youngster shouldered
a swag, and walked to Albury. Thence lie
proceeded to Sydney, enlisted under the name
of Bert Reddaway (Reddaway was his
mother’s maiden name), and for six weeks
was in camp. A defect in his eyesight was
then discovered, but he refused to undergo
the operation necessary to remedy it, re-
turned to Melbourne, and from there got
away with the 6th Battalion.
“G. Hooligan”: The death of
Larkin, M.L.A., was reported
weeks before the news came
through. On that occasion flags
were lowered in the Willoughby
electorate, whereupon the police
rushed round and threatened legal
proceedings for “disseminating
false war news.” No one seems
to know just where the news
sprang from, but the day then
mentioned was the right day, as
it turned out weeks after, though
there was no official confirmation,
by the way, till Holman had cabled
an anxious inquiry. Was it a
mere remarkable coincidence, or
are the arrangements so bad that
news which can come through
unofficially to-day can’t arrive
officially for three weeks?
Bad luck seems to attach to the artist
as a swaddy. Every Melbourne artist who
went to the Front is reported more or less
seriously injured, Jim McDonald, George
Benson and young McCubbin among the rest.
On July 1 South Aus. “scrapped” an un-
usually fine batch of civil servants for the
statutory offence of being over 70: J. B.
McNeil, general traffic-manager of Rail-
ways ; E. S. Berry, chief draughtsman ill the
Lands Titles Office; E. P. Laurie, ditto in
the Survey; Capt. Inglis, harbor-master at
Port Adelaide and inventor of a famous tide-

for a mere 54 years. It was to South Aus.,
aged two, that he first came as a boy from
Hackney (London). Ilis father was
promptly made Government Botanist by Gov-
ernor Gawler. and the youngster helped the
old man lay out the beginning of the now-
flourisbing Botanic Gardens. When they
were retrenched they made a garden in a
neighb ring suburb, which thus got its name
of Hackney.

If the story told by Billjim in his letters
to mother and the girls about Father
McAuliffe be true, another parson has
dropped his bundle of spiritual consolation
and grabbed a gun. No one who knew him
will be greatly surprised to learn that the
14st. Irishman with the red face and jovial
laugh who used to help the navy wrestle
with evil and play cricket at Garden Island
did this thing—that as the officers melted
away beneath the Turkish fire he rallied
the wavering line and set out hot-foot for
Tipperary behind a bayonet, wid the roaring
bhoys behind him. This practical pacifist
came to Australia about 10 years ago from
his native Dublin, and at Nowra (N.S.W.)
set out on a path of righteousness which
led to Gallipoli via St. Francis’s in the
Haymarket and St. Mary’s Cathedral, in
Sydney. He was about 35 when he sailed
away 'to serve as captain-chaplain amidst
the bursting shrapnel.

lie annoyed the other boys
greatly by taking the Sacrament in

the tongue—learned from returned
missionaries at his father's train-
ing college. Next time I met him
he was on an evangelising tour
here in Australia. This was a
great shock, on first thoughts;
on second, it was his obvious
career. Always a showy musician, he was
his own hymn leader, using a silver c-ornet
for the purpose. You could like Guinness or

TRANSFIGURED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A year ago the common things of life
Obsessed his mind. Sneering at young ambition,
Narrow and sharp as his own pocket-knife,
lie lived his days and filled some small position.
V common type, on the observant mind
lie made at most a shadowy impression,
And, passing, left one rather more resigned
To the swift marching of Life’s drab procession.
Ton million such have lived their pulseless day,
Have grumbled, schemed and sought the headstone’s
shadow;
Their records and their work have passed away;
Their bones lie deep in many a pleasant meadow.
Fate gave them nought; Peace spread her cloud-like
wing,
And Time mowed steadily as any reaper;
They never heard a British bugle sing
Nor felt the urge to be sweet Honor’s keeper.
But yesterday his destiny was theirs -
To breathe, and die, and lie all unremembered ;
But now his name with sudden glory flares,
As if a flame sprang on a hearth black-embered.
To him the ages gave what others prayed;
His portrait—once chance food for idle jesting—
Seems strangely stern; his own eyes, unafraid,
Sees Death's pale laurels on his young brows
resting.

COLUMN
X. 8. AYales Premier llolman breaks into
hallelujahs over a surplus of—you can call
it £030.047, or £430,000, or almost any other
old thing you like. It is, according to the
Treasury returns, £630,047 if you don t in-
clude a grant-in-aid of £200,000 paid to the
Public Works Fund. This fund was going
to be built up out of land-sales money and
virtuously employed to provide assets to
take the place of the alienated land. As a
matter of fact, hardly anything is nowadays
paid for out of this fund except repairs and
things that won’t bring in tuppence till
eternity itself wears out. The revenue and
total expenditure of the State for the past
two years have been as follows :
1914. 1915.
Total revenue .. .. £18,446,780 £18,952,256
Total expenditure . . 27,070,281 26,855,138
Year’s deficit . . £8,623,501 £7,902,882
In other words, the Holman Government
gave its supporters a rattling good time, and
passed £7,902,882 of the bill on to the un-
fortunate baby, who can't yet kick at the
polls. Not one penny of this was war ex-
penditure, and considering what actual war
expenditure the baby will have to carry, the
performance of the Holman crowd is con-
temptible.
While X. S. Wales had an ordinary
revenue £505.476 greater than that for the
previous year, Victoria, by refraining from
extra taxation in time of drought and war,
collected £458,129 less during the past year
—£10.114,688. as against £10,572,817. Fur-
ther, by keeping off the loan market as much
as possible, and charging repairs, renewals
and unproductive works to revenue, the
State will show a deficit of £1,500,000, or
thereabouts. It would have been quite easy
to contrive and fake a surplus of half a
million, as N. S. Wales has done. It would
simply have meant charging things up to
loan instead of revenue. State “surpluses”
are, as a rule, the greatest frauds in the
world.
Little S. Australia has had a shocking
time. Besides the drought, the suspension
of work at Broken Hill hit it hard. The
revenue was £3,995,294, a shrinkage of no
less than £827,472; yet the Treasury has
kept things pretty well in hand, and the
deficit will be much under that figure.
Queensland gives an illustration of what
was said just now about State surpluses
being nearly always a fraud. It doesn t pay
a Queensland Treasurer to have a big sur-
plus; for he can’t use it to come and go on
in the following year, but must employ it to
pay off old debt. Hence Queensland never
has a surplus of more than a few hundreds.
For the past year it is £3259. The mild
swindle is worked by the simple process of
paying much or little of the June accounts;
if there is anything over, the Treasury
allows very liberally for claims that may
come in. Nominally the year’s revenue was
£7,202,658, as against the previous year’s
£6,973,258. Expenditure <on _ revenue
account, as mentioned above, was £3259 less
than the receipts; but there was a further
£2,638,266 spent which the baby will_ have
to pav later on. This is about £4t»0.000
more than was got from the pawnshop in
the year before.
Westralia hasn’t spoken, and when it does
speak it will be a shocking sermon. Tas-
mania, which gets special help from the
Commonwealth, has merely said that its
revenue was £1,225,930, or the second-best
on record. Its trouble is that it has got
such a particularly unproductive lot of
assets. #

The co. was formed in July, 1912. to take
over the Youngs’ business of growing cane
and grinding sugar. The plantations,
which began with Fairyinead in 1880, in-
cluded at the time of the sale 5918 acres
of cane and 1581 acres of in
the Bundaberg and Isis districts. This
was valued as a whole at £180.780 “to the
co.” ; but since the co. might, in an unex-
plained spirit of benevolence, prefer to sell
to farmers at much less than the property
was worth to itself, the estate was put in
at £140,000. The plant, valued at £121.297.
was put in at £120.000. On the valuations,
therefore, the -co. started well over £40.000
to the good. The capital was £265,000 in
£1 shares. Of this the vendors took all but
£5OO0 —£150.000 in shares and the balance
in cash. After providing for managing
partners’ salaries, depreciation, etc., the
profits for 11 years had averaged £25,071 :
for the last six years, during which the
white labor policy had been in force, it had
averaged £27,504, and should have been
more had the milling business been pushed.
No doubt the figures from year to year had
been erratic. In 1907. for instance. Fairy-
mead crushed 103 208 tons of cane; in 1909
only 25,405 tons. Hence the results <>f the
eo.’s three years merely repeat old experi-
euce, and in view of the average profits over
so long a period the unevenness need cause
no concern.
Alter deducting £3600 a year for deprecia-
tion and (say) £l-00 for the past year's
income tax. the average net profits for the
past three years have been £29,124, which
is even better thaU the average on which
the public was invited in. Yet there is some
doubt whether, given equal seasons, the
next six years will show the same profit
as the first six under white, labor condi-
tions. True, white labor may be now a
little more expert than it was at the out-
set ; but the trend of pay has been steadily
upwards. It is a question whether it lias
gone up so rapidly in connection with any
other class of labor in Australia. However,
it isn’t likely for a while to go much fur-
ther ; and on the record of the past three
years the co. has no reason at all to suspect
that it won’t be able to comfortably main-
tain its 8 p.c. In spite of the fact that the
co. started off with very little cash, its
financial position is very easy. Liabilities
of all kinds on December 31 totalled
£24,677; and against that there were liquid
and semi-liquid items totalling over £50,000.

This co. lias three outstanding merits: (1)
its managing director is W. R. Dovey, an
actuary of good professional standing and
unquestioned integrity; (2) its Board, with
Dr. George Rennie as chairman, is highly
respectable, as a Board presided over by
Dr. George Rennie might be expected to
be; and (3) it has an adequate capital of
£53,053 subscribed and £17,684 paid. The
home-purchase business, with which the co.
is most concerned, is new to Australia.
Under unscrupulous management the system
lends itself to easy misrepresentation and
roguery. In fact*, it can bo said quite posi-
tively that house-purchase has been used as
a bait even in Australia, and either false
or tricky promises have been held out to
induce people to part with their money.
This can’t make tilings any easier for the
present co. And things will presently be
still harder for it' when the falseness or the
trickiness of other people’s representations
are exposed. That is the special wickedness
of misrepresentations in the insurance field :
it invariably takes a few years for the expo-
sure to ripen, and by that time not only is
the money lost, but the insurer is older,
and maybe no longer insurable. Insurance
offices themselves talk a good deal about
what they call ‘‘the moral hazard” —really
the immoral hazard, the risk that their
policy-holder will turn out to be a bad egg.
It is quite as important that people who
are contemplating insurance should remem-
ber that there is such a thing as a moral
hazard in choosing an office. This Assur-
ance and Thrift isn’t one that will suffer
under such an inquiry.
Home-purchase insurance struggles to
combine two of the most commendable
things in thrift, which is the commonest
virtue of good citizenship. It aims to give
a man insurance and his family a home —
both things which the State regards so
highly that in many places it helps him to
secure them. Broadly, the idea is that you
insure your life for a sum payable in 12, 15
or 20 years or at previous death. You can
at once borrow three-l’ourths of the amount
of your policy to buy a house worth at least
that much. After the policy has been in
force four or five years the co. will lend
the full amount. Having got your loan,
you start paying off with 3A p.c. interest
added. If you die, your widow gets the
house and the amount of the policy, less
whatever you haven’t thus far repaid on
the house. The policy carries bonuses, too.
Additions were made three years ago: fur-
ther additions are to be made now. as the
result of a recent valuation. It is possible
that a keen, healthy business man might in
ordinary times make a series of deals with
insurance and mortgage offices which would
give better results than he could get from
this or any other good house-purchase
office. But the average incompetent
financier will certainly not as a rule do
better than this concern can do for him.
Tiie Bulletin has had to make post-
mortems of insurance accounts which have
shown that the whole of the paid capital as
well as the greater part of the premiums
has gone in what is called “extension of
business.” There is no such item among
the assets of this co. The whole of the paid
capital -plus a sum in excess of all renewal
premiums received by the co. is represented
by loans on mortgage, property loans and
freeholds.
Besides the home-purchase branch there
are Thrift and General branches: which no
doubt include accident business. They are
small. Lump the figures:—

The expense rate here is heavy enough to
make one sad. Retail thrift is a despe-
rately slow and expensive business; in this
case it costs about 2ijd. f<> make the client
save Id, Almost the only justification is
that in time the client may like the taste
of the Id. so much that he will save another
without the intervention of the middleman.
And nobody will be more pleased about it
than the insurance middleman, because he
will be able to put his client on to some-
thing infinitely better.

Still no dividend; further, to quote the direc-
tors, “there is more than ever the necessity
for keeping all available cash in the. busi-
ness, and until there is some indication of
peace being proclaimed shareholders must
not expect to receive dividends.” The
Bulletin doesn’t know for certain; but it
suspects that that remark about keeping “all
available cash in the business” is a joke.

he mainly bank overdraft, has moved like

The capital wasn’t anything like sufficient to
stand that, wherefore the overdraft, etc.,
climbed as shown above. Now the co. is
faced with huge stocks, dear freights if it
wants to reach a market at once, the cer-
tainty of a poor local market in the future,
and higher interest rates for the money it
has to be accommodated with.
For the present “stocks are valued at
cost,” and it is on that basis the profits and
reserves are estimated. In view of the
ridiculously excessive costs of production in
most lines in Australasia during the
past few years, it is almost certain
that values of many stocks will have
to be written down; and McKenzie’s
will be fortunate if they wholly escape
this experience. In the circumstances, the
directors do the right thing in “keeping all
available cash in the business.” The build-
ing and construction boom must certainly
end. We must remember that we are merely
borrowing and spending now, pouring the
money out like water. When Australia has
had a borrowing jamboree hitherto it hasn’t
had to pay up afterwards. The jag has
stopped, and we have felt sick enough be-
cause we haven't been able to go on. The
mere discontinuance has caused the trouble.
But this time we shall have to pay back.
The old excuse was that if we didn’t have
the money we at least had its equivalent,
so why repay? This time we shall not be
able to plead that. AVe shall have to reduce
our debt —or at least we shall reduce it un-
less we are quite mad. In either case, there
will be hard money going out and none com-
ing in; and, though the producing indus-
tries may be exceptionally prosperous, the
industries on which businesses like
McKenzie’s depend are going to have a dull
time. Their best hope lies in an export trade.
By the way, one hardly expects to meet
this in McKenzie’s directors’ report; —
Although sellers of the co.’s shares at the present
market price are very few indeed, shareholders may
be induced to realise "on account of the non-payment
of dividends, and the directors cannot too strongly
urge upon shareholders the advisability of a careful
scrutiny of the balance-sheet, which discloses the
large surplus, outside the capital, of nearly £234,000,
before parting with their shares.
There are assets of a hook value of nearly
£234.000 beyond the liabilities. Beyond the
liabilities (£103,000 to the pfihlic and £6500
to the shareholders) and the capital there
are assets of a book value of £97,479 as shown
above. But of that amount £46,519 is a re-
serve for depreciation- Striking off that
amount, there are assets, according to the
hooks, to represent all the liabilities plus
nearlv 28s. per share. Everything, of course,
depends on whether hook values can be
realised.

The N. S. Wales Government in particular
and the other Australian Governments in
a less degree have been borrowing frankly
to give employment, and as the employment
has been chiefly on railway works this co.
lias reaped some of the harvest. "Business
during the half-year has been satisfactory,
the directors say. “The sawn-timber con-
nection has suffered owing to tire shrinkage
in building operations, but other branches
show favorable results. We still have in
hand good contracts.’’ But no matter how
eager Governments may be to borrow in
order to keep their supporters going at high
wages, the outlook for loans is just about
as black as it can be; and it is now pretty
plain that the Norton Griffiths contract
isn’t going to make things much easier so
far as N. S. Wales is concerned. With a
good harvest Governments may therefore
be expected to leave oil their present
struggle. As for ordinary building opera-
tions, it isn’t likely we shall see much
activity for a good many years to come.
This, however, will affect Allen Taylor’s
much less than most timber people, because
Taylor’s have always made a specialty of
railway and other big timber. Yet even for
this tlie future will not be what the past
few years have been.
The co. is in a first-rate position to meet
this change of fortune. Largely because it
didn’t reach out to any great extent for the
small-timber trade, it didn’t feel called upon
to maintain heavy stocks. For the other
trade —sleepers and piles, for instance—a
co. can mostly cut after the contracts have
been actually signed. Hence it hasn’t had
to pile up heavy overdraft and other debts:
and it won’t have to pay heavy interest
charges on stagnant stocks, which are liable
to depreciate as labor gets cheaper, as it is
quite likely to. This shows the position :

In the last 12 months the co. has thus re-
duced its book debts by nearly £17,000 and
its stock by £10,000; and these two move-
ments —both excellent as things are —have
enabled the co. to add nearly £lO,OOO to its
cash and liquid assets and reduce its own
small liabilities by £7OOO, notwithstanding
an expenditure of probably well over
£lO,OOO in connection with country mills—
mostly at Port Stephens, where a tramway
has been laid to tap hardwood supplies. Arid
besides the £lO,OOO added to cash and lhuiid
assets mentioned above, £3200 has been
added to the insurance and general reserve
fund, which is invested outside the business.
If book debts, largely due by public bodies,
are included with the liquid assets, the
latter amount to over £80,000; and that
doesn’t include stock and advances to saw-
millers, much of which no doubt represents
timber to be presently supplied to public
bodies under contract. For an industrial
concern a remarkable proportion of the
capital is well secured. Only a punting
prophet would promise any timber co. 10
p.c. dividends in the dull times to come:
but Allen Taylor’s seem particularly well
placed, financially and otherwise, to again
butt into export when the local trade °ets
as sick as it threatens to.
Luna Park, Limited (Melbourne). —
This co. runs a show at St. Ivilda (Vic.),
and has still a long way to go before it can
see its money back; and the amusement
proposition that doesn’t get, its money back
quickly doesn’t usually get it back at all.
Paid capital is £27,965; on this for the
past year 15 p.c. is paid = £4195. Goodwill
stands as an asset for £6900 ; and no doubt
there is a good deal of the £20,544 in “con-
struction and properties” which has little or
no value apart from the business.
The Inter-State Commission's report on
Oil and Shale, just issued, is one of the most
important it has sent to the printer. The
Bulletin has 20 times tried to. tell Aus-
tralia what vast wealth it has in its oil-
shale ; now the Inter-State Commission tells
the tale in an official way, after taking most
voluminous evidence. Came, Assistant Govt.
Geologist of N. S. Wales, says of the Com-
monwealth Oil Co.’s leases: “The two areas
outlined embrace 3100 acres, containing kero-
sene shale averaging 2ft. in thickness, which
involves rejecting part of the whole deposit,
and weighing- 761 b. per cub. foot, or a total of
9.163,157 tons. Other expert estimates
make it 10,000,000 tons. After allowing for
losses in distillation, this would give
733,052,560 gallons. “This,” says the Com-
mission. “is the largest known deposit of
kerosene shale in the world. It is also the
richest, with a yield, during the compara-
tively brief operation <sf the co., of 5o gal-
lons of crude oil per ton, as against 18 to
31 gallons in the Scotch lt will
be noted that the actual yield was 55 gallons
as against a theoretical 80 gallons. But
the works of this monumentally misman-
aged concern were in the wrong pla’ce, far
distant from the best shale, and the plant
was designed to treat the same poor stun:
that the Scotch mines yield. The main
trouble was that the whole thing was run
just as the N. S. Wales Government has
contracted with Norton Griffiths to run the
State’s public works, commission being paid
on expenditure. Then there is the British
Australian Co., not quite so badly misman-
aged. but with a poorer proposition to work:
it has 145,000,000 gallons in its properties—
mostly at Murrurundi.

no doubt be high in Australia. But it th e

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

money is big it will at least be spent and
kept in Australia, whereas if imported oil is
used the money goes away—which is »"
good to Australia. The British Australian
Co. says the cost <>f producing crude oil here
is 4d.' per gallon, while according to the
Commission, “the price of crude | natural
Avell | oil, landed in Sydney, is said to he
2ld. per gallon; and unless the local cos.
can make up the 11d. by bounties, or reduce
their costs, they have to meet that disad-
vantage.” As the output from any Avoi'ks
that appear to be practicable could not
supply Australia’s own demand for kerosene
(over 18,000,600 gallons a year), the Com-
mission recommends, instead of a duty, a
bonus of Id. per gallon, which is half o.t
what people interested in the business
asked for. On a capital of £1,000,000
(which the Commission thinks should be
sufficient for the tAvo cos.), this bounty would
give nearly 6 p.c. on an output of 14,000,000
gallons. The Aveak point is that, in view
of the fierce competition and enormous light-
ing forces of the foreign oil trusts, the Aus-
tralian producers could probably not find a
market for 14,000,000 gallons of crude oil
a year, which would equal (say) 2,200,000
gallons of refined kerosene. One thing is
clear. It is disgraceful that the largest
deposit of the richest kerosene shale in the
Avorld should not be energetically worked,
and that the country should continue to
import the foreign goods. If the Common-
Aveaith is not prepared to take the whole
thing over, it should at least say: “If you
work under our general supervision and to
our satisfaction, avo will see that you get
6 p.c. on your capital-—for 10 years, at any
rate.” The amount of capital would, of
course, liaA r e to be agreed upon. No guar-
antee should be given in respect to. capital
which has been wasted. The Sulphide Cor-
poration gave a similar undertaking in con-
nection with zinc works. It didn’t Avant to
raise more capital itself, but it badly Avanted
to see spelter Avorks established, so it guaran-
teed interest to an independent concern, the
Central Zinc Co., Avhich thereupon estab-
lished works at Seton Carew —one of the
coastal places that have lately had the
attentions of Willie’s Zeppelins.

Great Cobar has been granted two months’
suspension of labor conditions in respect of
the Chesney and Cobar Gold Mines leases.
David Fell, representing the debenture
holders, gave evidence regarding the efforts
made to raise the' £102,000 necessary to re-
start the mines. The security at first avail-
able had been hawked from uncle to uncle
in London and Sydney Avithout success. The
Court Avas then appealed to and gave per-
mission to the Receiver to issue £lOO certifi-
cates for the amount required, carrying 71
p.c. interest, and giving priority to the
subscribers. It was, however, necessary to
circularise the debenture holders, and make
them a first offer. The applications attached
to the circulars were to be returned to the
Receiver, together Avith instalment money, on
June 30, after Avhich date the Receiver would
knoAV exactly Avhat outside capital must be
got. In the event of the debenture holders
not being prepared to subscribe the whole
lot, it Avill be necessary for the Receiver
to negotiate with the underwriters to take up
the unsubscribed certificates. As these will
be issued at £B5, they should go off all right,
especially at the present price of copper. In
the event of this scheme failing, Heaven
alone knows what is going to happen. The
Court may be appealed to again, and may
order a sale of the properties. This Avould
probably return under 25 p.c. of the deben-
ture debt, Avhich isn’t cheerful. The Warden
said he was perfectly satisfied that the co.
had made and Avas making every effort to
raise the necessary money. On present appear-
ances there will be very little if any smelt-
ing done this year. Meanwhile some institu-
tion is financing the co. on overdraft. If
this uncertain supply of coin Avas cut off, the
Avater would have to be allowed to rise in the
different shafts, which would further depreci-
ate the security of the debenture holders.

Apart from a find of a little alluvial tin
near Ardlethan 'township, the field continues
to have no luck outside the Carpathia. That
show makes good sales, and is building up a
cash reserve in the hope that, when divi-
dends start again, they may be kept going
regularly—a large thing for a small lode-tin
mine to hope for. In this show a patch of
fair copper ore Avas struck lately. Wild
Cherry is having a bad time, some shifts
running for hardly more than a bag of con-
centrates ; and White Crystal is having a
struggle to keep its concentrated up to a
decent quality. Drumlish Hill has had a
■small and bitter-cold return from the Cross
battery.
An order by consent has been made by the
Berth Supreme Court for the liquidation of
Chaffers. The petition was first presented in
December last, but Avas adjourned from time
to time to give the co. a chance to soothe its
creditors. It has now managed to do so.
Instead of getting cash, they take debentures
in a neAV co.

Tindal’s (W.A.) has given it best at last.
More than 25 years’ struggling has failed to
put the mine on a payable basis, and the
Board has come to the conclusion that it is
useless, “without funds far in excess of
present resources,” to persevere any longer.
Shareholders are to be asked to agree to the
shoAA r being disposed of, lock, stock and bar-
rel, As pointed out times beyond number on
this page, Avhat the property needed most was
gold and brains. It might have pulled through
with the little it had of the former; hut un-
fortunately for shareholders it got very little
of the latter until it Avas too late. As a
company concern the shoAV looks hopeless.

Over 17,000 tons last half-year tvere beaten
out, and as that ore Avith tailings was worth
oA r er £75,000, the co., if no crushing had
been done, Avould have developed £105,000 of
gold for the term. This is not bad going
for a little concern in 42,000 shares. Rop-
ing in all previous yields, the output of the
mine to April 30 last Avas 47.2160 z. gold
and 63140 z. bullion Avon from 49,572 tons.
Net value of the gold is £210,589, or
£4 4s. lid. per ton, out of which £98,555 has
been paid in divs., or £2 6s. per share. This
on a paid-up capital of £21,425 ; and assum-
ing estimates of reserves to be O.K. another
£6 is in sight. Surveyor Macartney’s plans
noAA r emphasise (1) the widening of the
elboAv of the shoot at 225 ft. and (2) of the
big bulge to the north-east and (3) the
rapidity of the underlie to the north, with
apparently a closing-up of the distance be-
tween the main and No. 2 reefs. Measure-
ments at the elboAv give the main reef a
Avidtli of 17ft. Then 9ft. of lOchvt. forma-
tion lies between it and No. 2 reef, Avhile
4ft. of that reef averages 12dwt. The bulge
north-west, 36ft. Avide, is under the fault
shown in No. 2 level and may be a direct
result of that occurrence. Sulphides ap-
pear in the bottom at 225 ft., so the
300 ft. level is to disentangle more than one
problem—especially as to Avhether tighter
country will bring with it any contraction
in width and values. The last bit of
gossip before the water beat the pumps at
300 ft. Avas that the crosscut was in “kindly”
schist, Avhich may mean anything.

Kyarra (W.A.) has had a fall-out Avitli
the Miners’ Union over contract work and
has closed down in a huff. Managing-
director Shallcross’s statement of the case
is that a party of men started to deepen
the shaft on the contract and bonus system,
but the union would have none of it and
the party pulled out. The experiment of
sinking by day labor Avas then tried; but
instead of the shaft being put down at a
minimum speed of 7ft. to Bft. a week and at
a cost of £9 per foot, the average has been
under 3ft. and the cost £27 per foot. This
Avas more than the co. could stand, so it
sacked its 65 employees and put its shutters
up. Sliallcross says it is unlikely that
operations will be resumed until the union
Avithdraws its embargo on contract work.

Re F. C. Tricks’s option over a recently-
reported rich find in De Jarlais’s claim at
Bulla Bulling (W.A.). If a deal is made the
vendors are to get £2OOO cash and £2OOO in
promoters’ shares in a 60,000 co.
Commodore (W.A.) hopes to give share-
holders something shortly. It claims to have
more than two-thirds of the market value of
all the shares in hand, but some of this is
being laid out on neAV machinery and plant
to treat the accumulated residues. There
are several thousand tons of these stacked on
the surface. A profit of Bs. per ton is ex-
pected from them. Besides this, regular sur-
pluses of a few hundreds a month are looked
for from the battery.
Associated Northern (W.A.) is getting a
little tributors’ royalty from its noAv almost
worked-out Ivalgoorlie lease, and as a result,
it is said, of better extraction, managed last
month to make a few hundreds profit at its
Victorious (Ora Banda) leases. But this
show does not appear good at depth, and is
not likely to last very long.
Two experts recently inspected a mag-
nesite deposit at Bulong (W.A.). A large
body of the mineral is in sight, and the
quality is said to he improving. About 50
tons are being sent to Melbourne for treat-
ment so as to give some idea of the real
value of the find.
Bull rush (W.A.) struggles on. New
ground in its hitherto indifferent Royal
Standard lease has given encouraging
assays, and the last crushing of 1300 tons
averaged 30s. 2d. over the plates, with an
estimated 6s. 9d. in the tailings. Miners
are scarce, but as soon as the co. can get a
full complement it hopes to run the mill at
its full capacity, retrieve past failures and
earn something for shareholders.

Tributors are now getting a few pickings
off the bones of the Golden Ridge (W.A.).
A local paper remarks that it’s the same
old story—a co. giving up and tributors
doing well. But in this case they can’t do
well for long.

Trembath of Bendigo is standing sponsor
for the Victoria Proprietary, Diamond Hill.
This is the mine over which John Bull

real Bendigo float of 50,000 shares of 20s.
each. Bendigonians don't spend money in
swell board fees, like J. Bull does; so John’s
failure doesn’t always baulk them. In this
case they will fasten on to the Victoria
because of the chance of picking up the
Goldfields shoot in that claim.

The ncAv opal find at Stuart’s Range
( S.A.) Avas made by a prospector from
Narracoorte district. Stuart’s Range is
100 miles a little north of Avest of William
Creek, on the Oodnadatta line. It is a big
field and the parent syndicate, the NeAv
Colorado, has lifted 20 square miles, as the
S.A. laAvs regard opal mining as similar to oil
drilling. The Department has now, hoAvever,
shut down on the five-square-mile search-
license, and the second syndicate, the Tas-
manian Colorado, has pegged nine _ 40-acre
leases. The opal is of fine quality, but
might as Avell be china-clay for all its value
until the war is over. Tassy O’Connor
broke away to the field after vainly pros-
pecting a neighboring region for gold.

S.A. Oihvells Co.’s report for the half-year
ended May 20 includes rejoinders by Dr.
Basedow and manager Charlton Dod to the
dogmatic say-so of Dr. Wade. BasedoAV sums
up Wade s deductions as “neither logical nor
scientific,” and also contradicts him on his
alleged “facts.” But the most awkward com-
ments of all are made by the log of the co.’s
Avell at Robe. The hole is doAvn 927 ft., and
has struck three pockets of gas, and Dod
figures that “indications are favorable to the
conclusion that oil will be struck Avithin the
next feAV months.” The co. has selected the
site for its second well, has placed the 30,000
reserved shares, and is in a good financial
position.

For June Kamunting, in the Malay Penin-
sula, had a yield of 85 tons of black tin,
Avorth say £B3OO. Costs may be about
£1200; and this would give the extraordi-
nary profit of over £7OOO from one dredge
for a month. The Kamuntiug’s office is in
England, though the Austral Malay Co.
Avas interested in the ground and joined in
the flotation, so the holding of shares in
Sydney is considerable. The Austral Malay’s
other ‘flotation, the Ivampong Kamunting.
didn’t get its first dredge going on as good
a patch as its neighbor; still its June win
Avas 351 tons, Avhich realised £3471. In the
Kam pong’s report for the half-year, just
issued, managing-director Freeman says
that for May “the working costs per cub.
vard Avere slightly under 3d., as against
4Jd. estimated in the prospectus.’’ He adds
that the loav figures were due in a large
measure to the dredge being new. “But,
he says, “with tvro dredges working to then-
full capacity I now doubt whether inclusive
Avorking costs Avill ever greatly exceed 31d.
per cubic yard.” With costs at 3ld. per
yard, last month’s yield Avould show a profit
of £2421. This co. has only one. dredge
available at present. But a second is being
put together on the mine, and it ought to
start so as to give the shareholders some-
thing extra for Christmas. Judging by the
boring plans, it will be at. once in much
better ground than No. 1 is in.
The Ivampong started off Avith rather too
much Avater and not enough cash. There
are 130.000 issued shares. 80,000 of which
(fullv paid) Avent for the property. That
left £50,000; and the property (including
development) has cost about £13.000 more
than the 80,000 shares. That cut things
very fine for a co. Avith two big dredges
under contract. By the end of February
the co. oAved £7405; but tin sales have re-
lieved the situation, and the Avhole of the
work done during the next four months
added only about £2500 to the debt. There
is a lot of work still to do to the second
dredge; but the chances are that 10.000
reserved shares aa t lll be issued, and AA’ith
£2500 a month profit coming in. the co.
shouldn’t have much difficulty, if the tin
market behaves itself, in starting dividends
early in 1916. The £2500 from one dredge
is equal to over 20 p.c. on the £140.000 at
which the capital will no doubt stand by
the time the first div. is paid. The co. has
384 acres of dredging ground and another
2SO acres under option. There is room on
that lot for at least three dredges for 10
years or more. Kamunting’s area is about
120 acres.
Austral Malay, tlie prospecting co. which
introduced Australia to the. Kampong,
Kamnnting and Larut, holds 8555 Kampong
shares, 5000 Kamuntings and 256 Laruts.
The co., which has a first-class organisation
in the Malay Peninsula, with A. W. Free-
man as managing director, is still very
actively testing properties and acquiring
options. The co. now holds under option
3500 acres; and, on the word of the trust-,
worthy Freeman, “it is already known that
at least 500 acres of the total will show
about Id. per cubic yard profit _with tin at
its present price of about £1(55 per ton."
Austral Malay has 20,000 issued shares;
and, apart from the options, the holdings in
the three floated cos. are worth at present
values approximately 20s. per share.
Bendigo lias just had its worst half-year.
So little gold has never been won before —
58,5820 z. The period shows a profit of only
£6124 —that is, dividends in excess of calls.
Since 1878 the first half of 1904 was the
best —gold, 120,8530 z.; divs., £186,198 :
calls, £79,316; profits for six months,
£106,882. There were then 11 dividend-
payers, and 60 mines were worked, com-
pared with the present 68. Shortage of
water and dearth of speculation are the
chief causes of the recent poor record. There
has been a marked increase in tributing. but
not nearly enough dead work has been done.
The five Lansell proprietary mines produced
only 30160 z.

How to Have a Clear
Complexion.
It is quite easy even in a hot climate like
Australia to prevent the wrinkling, drying
and blotching effect of the dust and heat, but
it is absolutely necessary to use a pure soap
without any added coloring matter or excess
of soda. Puritol Wax Soap is such
a soap, with just a little fine .per-
fume added, and some Puritol wax,
which has such a reputation for keeping the
skin soft and for removing pimples .'and
blotches. A very fine film of the wax is left
on the skin after using this soap, which
effectually protects the skin from heat .and
dust. Its healing effect is Avell known on
blotchy skins, and undoubtedly many of the
fine complexions are due to the use of Puritol
Wax Soap.*

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, July 5, 1915.
My Dear Arini,—
Governor-General Ferguson comes this
way again on July 20. The Naval College
at Jervis Bay is the objective. The Hope
Osbornes will shelter his Ex. for a clay or
two.
. A Parliamentary reception in Macquarie-
stieet last week circled round the Jap
officers. The company asked to meet the
training ships’ Admiral and staff really did
meet them, for they’re friendly, smiling
sailor men and eager to air their English.
Premier Holman and his lady lurked in
wait for visitors in the hall that falls down
suddenly in the Assembly quarters. After
disentangling itself from a grove of pot-
plants, the company gave its hand to the
rest of the Ministerial party, and fled to the
open air. Here a band bustled round the
Allies’ music, and far-seeing folks seated
themselves at tables heavily stacked with
provender.
The Town Hall officials were early in the
field. Mayor Richards and his soft-voiced
missus, with the urbane Deputy Layton and
his best girl, took up a commanding position
in the thick of the visiting warriors. Gov-
ernor Strickland and a young daughter
came with Aide Pasco, R.N. The William
McMillan dame, not long back from Eng-
land, had a precipitous black toque, with a
sheer wall in front, perched on her head.
She was otherwise clothed in demure black.
Mrs. Charles Wade’s snug squirrel rug or
coat and the riot of black fox that trailed
round the shoulders of slender Mrs. Neville
Mayman were It for a chilly day. The
.1. J. Cohen pair and a long tail of political
top-hats squeezed through the throng. Mrs.
Wright, suitably clad in purple and fine
muslin, loomed large in the wake of her
gaitered Arehbish. Russell French was
faithful to his special fancy iii square-top
millinery. District Court Judge Murray,
rarely seen at tea parties, brought daughter
Eileen. And the Allen Taylor dame showed
an extensive feathered hat.
The Aso was “at home"’ on Saturday,
and the Stricklands and our own nobility
were present in swarms. A whole-hearted
desire to lay hands on anythin o- movable
and carry it off animated the company. This
polite form of pillage has been a feature
of the visits of foreign warships; and the
passion to strip the vessel —French, Yankee,
Russian or Jap, it is all the same —makes
a local boarding party look like a cheerful
gang of pirates, quite fearless of conse-
quences. The hosts grin and bear it. But
the vexed question as to what is loot and
what is souvenir crops up sub rosa after the
highway gang has stumbled down into the
launches. Of the queer foods the Sydney
girls sampled on the Aso they give the best
mark to seaweed jelly. It slips down the
throat like iced sea-foam.
A big consignment of Jap officers and
middies, under the eye of their flag-lieu-
tenant, were whisked off by special train to
the Mountains. They had a look at Went-
worth Falls, Blackheath and Ivatoomba.
After doing all the giddy things required of
trippers, such as hanging over the edge of
Govett’s Leap, the party recuperated over
afternoon tea at the Carrington. The
local Mayor poured forth suitable oratory,
and the Blue Mountain highlanders rushed
the visitors with personal tokens of their
amicable feelings.
Mrs. Shimizu, the pretty little wife of the
Jap Consul, was so excited at the recent
visit of her countrymen that she mislaid
the English language, and replied to local
conversation in her own tongue. In calmer
moments the small official dame talks fluently
in the language of Pitt-street, and assidu-
ously cultivates Australian ways. Last
week she could only turn a pair of pale
pink cheeks to Society’s “How do?'’ and mur-
mur something that sounded like boiled
Italian.
There has been loss pidgin-Englisli thrust
on the Jap. visitors this time. It has
dawned on our Best People that a Japanese
officer either speaks our language easily or
keeps a shipmate handy to act as interpreter.
Admiral Chisaka, as unassuming as a cheer-
ful middy, can onlj' hand out a few labored
samples of our speech. But he is shadowed
by a lieutenant with a willow-wand figure
who acts as referee. The little super-skipper
is hung with naval glory in the form of
medals for this, that and the other.
Amongst those present in a glittering crowd
across his chest is a decoration like the gaud
that swings from the neck of a Companion
of Michael and George. “Same as your
country’s Victoria Cross,” whispers the soft-
voiced interpreter. “The plain bronze
medal? Ah-h—that is for War.” Then
the slender sotto voce looks absently into a
horizon of brick wall on the edge of Parlia-
ment House lawn.
Licut.-Colonel Hayes, in command of the
Middlesex Reg. and Scottish Rifles which
covered themselves with glory in France
lately, is an Australian. Father was the late
G. 11. Hayes, of Caulfield (Vic.). Accord-
ing to Gen. French, “no regiment ever up-
held the traditions of British warfare more
worthily” than the men who were led by
Colonel “Bob” of Australia. His wife used
to be Kitty Macartney, a grand-daughter of
Melbourne’s first Anglican Dean.
The Atlienseum Club had a table of its
own at the farewell dinner to Hugh Ward.
The spry young man who won’t grow old
was patted on the hack, in a series of short,
pithy speeches, by Mayor Richards, Minister
Cann, George Titheradge and “Hop.” Owing
to the total absence of acoustic properties
in the Town Hall vestibule, where this
spread occurred, the guest of honor merely
saw that something was going on in his
favor, and replied to that effect.
Emily Siedeberg, Bachelor of Medicine
and Surgery, of Maoriland, has been called
off; to the hospitals. She was the first
woman to graduate in Medicine at Otago
University, and the first to write prescrip-
tions in the wintry islands.
Artist Ethel Stephens’s show of oils and
water colors is open in Anthony Hordern’s
Gallery. Louisa Macdonald, M.A., the
learned bluestocking of the Women’s Col-
lege, turned the key.
Alfred Deakin and his wife stepped off
the Niagara the other day after their
abbreviated official trip to the Panama
Exposition. The ’Frisco show, big as it
looks in the matter of ground space, smells
like a wet cracker even at this distance. It
was German William, of course, who
damped it down.
Young Wyatt Itawson’s wedding was
dated for June. He was the baby of our
former Viking’s family when they came to
Sydney, and will be remembered as a seri-
ous schoolboy entrenched behind very deep
Eton collars. Now he’s in a British In-
fantry Regiment that is due to step out
shortly in France. The bride is an English
girl, Miss Esther Paley.
The big concert for the Red Cross owes
a vote of thanks, first of all, to Mrs. Alex.
Gordon, who started the movement. Her
own Welsh song-contributions were sec-
onded by a lady harpist whose picturesque
dead-gold locks, a la Joshua Reynolds,
matched the instrument’s frame. A money-
snatcher at this affair was the autogranh
fiend. Her name was legion, and she
stalked through the hall armed with foun-
tain pen and blank paper. For sixpence a
head Society was able to add its signature
to a tome which may eventually be hurled
into the Royal presence. The study in
handwriting is intended to dazzle the Prince
of Wales.
The S’Australian Galways were at the
Red Cross concert in the Town Hall. She
has a fine head of white hair, in the latest
acorn-shaped brim, and looks like a woman
with an opinion of her own. Local Society
was divided about the red band which the
lady had strapped round the corsage of her
evening frock. Perhans it was only a yard
and a half of crimson silk riband, but if
might have been something tremendous in
foreign decorations.
Still another terror of the great war. This
time it’s a sock competition. The referees.
Mrs. Harry Finn and Miss Knox, have sur-
vived the scrimmage, and handed the bay
leaf, or whatever it may be, to a Homebush
champion, Mrs. Burns. Hitherto much
bad and lumpy knitting has been compla-
cently presented to the Rod Cross. _ This
competition was really an effort to raise the
standard and save the indignant feelings of
experts who have to unpick derelict socks in
order to save precious wool.
The Geoffrey Elkingtons are in Sydney
again. They came from Auckland in the
Niagara, just in time to have a look at
Mrs. Geoffrey’s successor in Bunty's
crinoline at the Palace Theatre. Ella
Young, who used to pull the strings in
Graham Moffat’s play, married the M.L.
run-holder, as you know.
Melbourne’s Scotchbyterian shepherd, Dr.
Marshall, accompanied by his wife, dropped
into this port the other day, after a month’s
holiday amongst the cocoanuts of the Pacific
Isles. Mrs. Marshall has a nephew in a
Scottish regiment whose sense of humor sur-
vived months of winter trench-work in
France. Writing to Auntie ho remarked
that his kilt, which had floated on the water
in which he stood waist-deep, had stiffened
into a layer of ice, and he had to await the
coming of fine weather to thaw the starch
out. Tailors load coats and skirts with
metal discs to keep them down. Something
of this kind might be done to make the
Hielander’s petticoats sit down in the
water.
The eldest son of Tom Hughes, M.L.C.,
is going to offer shortly. He is a fine, up-
standing Australian in his last year in the
medical school, where exams, have been
hurried forward so that the young men may
lend their help to the senior operators.
The Girls’ Realm motor ambulance, for
home use is coming nearer. The Cafd
Chantant in the Salon de Luxe has tossed
about £l5O into the collection plate, and
£2OO had already been scraped together by
country centres. Bathurst Girl Realmers
sent along a plump checiue. Wahroonga
damsels, after a well-organised raid —the
battle cry for an ambulance beinsr sounded
by Mrs, Crichton Smith —handed in £93 as
their little bit. The £5OO necessary is
almost in sight, so organising-secretary
Grace Burrows can pay a fat deposit and
order Tommy Kangaroo’s petrol-chaise at
once.
Pauline Bindley, who sang through Aus-
tralia and Maoriland with Paul Dufault,
is not going to have her voice sandpapered
by European specialists—just yet. Instead
the tuneful Pauline will teach the young
canary in Victoria until Europe is a safer
place to travel in. Where only songs of
hate are chanted is no place for a soprano.
Dr. Charlie Armitage, of Mosman, is with
the British R.A.M.C., and is likely to be
somewhere near the Front just now.
Australian Nightingales who were reliev-
ing the overworked Netley Hospital sister-
hood for a while, have gone on duty at
Harefield Park —the private mansion that
has been turned into one of three chief patch-
ing-up places for overseas wounded.
Mrs. York Syme, a sister of George Reid,
is still in Sydney. She is not long back
from a trip to the other side. The large
lady with the soft smile is about as slim as
her brother ; but she can add to her length
by a dizzy tower of feather. The Hat as
seen at a recent outdoor tea-party was a
remarkable episode in ostrich fluff.
George Titheradge tore himself away from
his daffodils the other afternoon to open the
Loan Exhibition in Mosman Town Hall.
Funds were for the cause which has its
climax on July 30. Artist Mabel Barling,
Avho has a fancy for painting wild beasts,
rendered first aid in promoting this event.
She lent some of her lions and tigers, and
borrowed Art profusely from resident celebri-
ties. Artist Jackson —he who delights in
painting a pale lilac lady under a green
tree —assisted. Tith., introduced by the
local curate, got over the preliminaries with-
out any casualty. A real live Belgian re-
fugee—a pretty youngster in national garb—
sold sweets at appropriate intervals.
Mrs. Inues-Noad—a sister of Bruce
Smith—and a couple of daughters are set-
tling down in the Thames Village for a
while. They left here in the Malwa. The
Ashburton Thompsons are camping in Lon-
don, too. She has a son at the Front and
another in training for the same ambiguous
address.
Carrie Lancelj, the North Sydney soprano,
is likely to return this way shortly. She has
been in England for years, with a break three
winters or so ago, when she tripped back to
see if Gore Hill was in the same place. The
war has, of course, bowled over the concert
singer’s tours. So she has been working at
the usual honorary rates for the relief of
Belgian and other sufferers.
An indignant hostess arches her back and
sends an indignant meow: —
Like many other women who are blessed with a
roomy home, I am only too glad to place it at the
disposal of entertainments for Australia Day. But
I do object, after getting up a big affair of this
kind, to see my wallpaper marked by the matches
of lady smokers, who strike them right down the
most delicate background. Is it too much to ask these
cigarette devotees to use match-boxes in other people’s
houses? They can do as they like in their own
menageries. Also, will those enthusiasts who are at
present raffling everything except aged grandmothers
kindly confine their activities to their own pre-
mises? The spectacle of a damsel carrying a night-
gown around to show in somebody else’s parlor, and
boldly clamoring for Help for some charity fund
she’s interested in, makes the owner of the house feel
like scratching back.
The National Council of 'Women con-
tinues to put on its best hat to discuss Life
as we should like it to be. The gathering at
Government House last week —Lady Edeline
behind the president’s inkpot—got nearer
to the war zone than is the Council’s wont.
There’s a notion to form war-study circles,
presumably to discuss the Higher Thought
about infernal machines.
The news that the Victorian girl Alice
McCulloch is now in Egypt, giving her ser-
vices to the ambulance authorities, will be
received with loud applause. This brilliant
horsewoman, the recent star rider over Syd-
ney show-ground hurdles, has been gather-
ing useful experiences for months in France.
Happily she doesn’t know the necessity of
earning a crust. Her dash and fine physique
will mark her A 1 amongst the women on
(lie fringe of the carnage.
Bunty’s pork-pie hat and crinoline have
come to the Palace Theatre for a brief fare-
well. One of the mysteries of the black vel-
vet pill-box millinery was its adhesiveness.
The youngster who sprinted over the kirk-
yard wall in a crinoline topped by this style
of headgear arrived intact. Possibly the
thing was gummed on. Another difficulty of
the crinoline was its balloon-like quality.
When Teenie looks coy her wire-cage
waggles, till it threatens to smack the young
man across the face when the girl inside
floats into a seat. Jean Clyde, the new
Bunty, has sharper corners than Ella Young
used to show. A feature of the first-night
audience was the white plume worn by Mrs.
York Syme in a stage box. _ The gear was
barricaded by a glittering circlet that held
the dome of a high coiffure firmly at atten-
tion.
Dorothy Little, of the Society clan into
which young Tony Ilordern married, was
wed early this week to Eardley Wilmot,
R.N., of the Encounter. The ceremony
was of the fashionable war-time pattern —as
quiet as the joyful clatter of a few rela-
tives and friends allowed it to be. Dorothy
is a slim, dark-haired girl, who used to be
considered rather like the aquiline Lady
Dudley, and possibly cultivated the pleasing-
fiction.
The Sheep Show brought the usual winter
rush of woolly chieftains to town. The
veteran Sam McCaughey —who gives £lO,OOO
to Australia Day on time payment —two
Falkiners, a few Osbornes, a squatting
Simpson, and the Mitchells, of Coryohg,
have been here to see the wrinkled peers get
their bit of blue ribbon.
To help Australia Day, “Hindle Wakes”
was three times performed by the Reper-
tory Society—and admirably performed after
the first night’s uncertainty—to houses that
gaped with empty seats. Yet Kay Souper
and Hugh Jennings and Edith Gavin Brown
and Eveline Douglas were worth going a
long way to see. The public is not at
present favorably impressed with the work
of various amateur societies which air their
elocution in the little theatre with the
gloomy inside. It doesn't understand that
the Repertory Society fries its own fish, so
to speak, and haughtily repudiates any con-
nection with lesser histrionic genius. So
the public stays away, and the Society plays
to irresponsive chair-backs.
Mrs. Syd Walford’s bridge and tennis
party the other afternoon raised about £5O
for the relief of the wounded.
The doctors’ wives are coming to heel
rather slowly in the matter of that thousand
for Australia Day. Only about half the
amount is in the committee’s locker, over
which the Anderson Stuart dame broods as
president. Hubby will have to be coaxed
again.
Dorothy Bird, a Marrickville girl, has
made the usual promise to an Anglo-Indian,
Paul Johnson. He is the eldest son of Sir
Henry Johnson, of Sloane Gardens, in
London.
Some of the junior Japs from the train-
ing ships spent an afternoon at the Strick-
land chalet, and played tennis with a glee-
some party of girls. The visitors managed
their racquets in a way that astounded the
Y'oung Person.
The kilted skirts are so much an obses-
sion of the moment that they are likely to
die hard before spring muslins come along
with Wattle Day blooms. The monotony
of the feminine exterior is broken at the
top by a tiny hat which perches sideways on
the head. The new veils, which hang in
full folds like small black mosquito-nets, are
weighted with edges of raven silk or velvet.
The lialf-way-to-the-nose veiling hasn’t been
a tumultuous success, but it still struggles
for a place.
The Australian Trained Nurses’ Associa-
tion is going to find out if there isn’t any
remedy for the rush of butterflies to “nurse”
the interesting heroes of the Dardanelles.
Some of these entirely untrained damsels
were allowed to flop around a few local sur-
gical cases the other day, presumably to get
their hand in, and amongst other details for-
got one of the decencies of the profession.
This is the silence the trained nurse draws
round the names and ailments of her
patients.
“Ida I me” (Mrs. Marriott), whose just-
published “Log of the Lady Nelson” adds
some very interesting scraps to early Aus-
tralian history, is the only Australian
woman who is or ever has been a Fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society. Much
of her time is spent at the Admiralty
Library. Husband Marriott is secretary of
the English Rugby Union, and was captain
of the rep. team of which Gregory Wade,
of Sydney, was a member.
Penrose Franklin, the footballing master
of Sydney G. of E. Grammar School,
is unanimously elected headmaster of
Melbourne Church of England Grammar.
Blanch left to become “head” of the
big Christchurch School in Maoriland.
The Melbourne school’s first “head"
was Bromby, who at 75 scandalised
Bishop Moorhouse by marrying a young girl
—and a shoemaker’s daughter! She was
in the ladies’ choir in Old St. Paul’s —a sort
of ecclesiastical ballet. After Bromby.
Morris was “head.” Morris had married
Chief Justice Highibotlmm’s daughter; and,
inspired by that great man. lie gave a lecture,
advocating more liberal land laws. The
squatters who formed the backbone of the
school thereupon declared that he must go,
and he went. After that the school wel-
tered. Its best-known old scholar is Deakin:
but he achieved no distinction at school.
What becomes of the prize boys? Asche, as
a boy, wanted a small part in the school's
amateur theatricals. The stage manager,
a little master called Peggy, drove him away.
“Asche,” he said, “you’re too ugly ever to
become an actor.”
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, July 5, 1915.
My Hear Yarrje.-
There was a bis crowd at the Grand
National meeting at Flemington on Satur-
day; but the social element had gaps in it.
The war is beginning to tell its tale in this
section. Lady M. F. wore furs, with some
of her favorite red glimpsing out here and
there, llimself, who looked with rather a
cold eye on racing when he first came to
Australia, seems to be developing into a
whole-hearted sport. I don’t suggest that
he goes about pestering people for tips, or
that he has joined Tattersall’s Club in order
to get a chance to play 100 with bookmakers.
But he appears more resigned to it than he
was at first. Governor Stanley was there,
and with him his faithful secretary, Victor
Hood.
A short fur coat, hip-length, over a flaring
skirt of flimsy material running into many
wards of hem, and under that, again, spatted
boots —this was the get-up of the moment.
The smartest spats are glued to the patent
leather, and cover even the heels. Quite
five inches of ankle are shown by the best
people. One girl was so fascinated watching
her own new boots that she fell over her
feet, and might have broken her neck on
the public lawn but for a brisk recovery.
The kliaki-color of Mrs. McEvoy’s cloth coat
was reproduced in the cloth-covered heels of
her cloth-spatted feet. The general effect
was as of some fair sea-bird pattering about
on the sand —a rather topheavy bird with
no wings to keep it on the dead level. Mrs.
Geoffrey Syme wore a real old polonaise,
and walked the lawn like a materialised
portrait of somebody’s great-grandmother-
when-a-girl. The garment fitted snugly over
two flounce hems; the ankles were white-
spatted and the velvet hat was brimmed
round with ermine fur. Mrs. George Chirn-
-dde looked delectable in black and furs. Her
daughter, Audrey, was in something drab
surmounted by a funereal black hat. Dr.
Joyce, who is getting thinner, was with his
wife, who wore lovely skins. Mrs. AVillmott
also wore pelts, and a visitor from some
other State looked extremely Chinese in a
hairv garment which was cut like a man-
darin’s coat. The hat was a mandarin’s
head-covering, and from the side of it 'hung
a yard-long plait of ribbon made up to' re-
semble a Chinaman’s queue.
To drink or not to drink, that is the ques-
tion in our llupper Suckles. At vice-regal
dinners their Exes, drink barley water in
an almost pointed manner. In the circum-
stances. Mrs. Toorak feels chary about sip-
ping champagne, being obsessed with a
horrid suspicion that the self-denying ordi-
nance on the part of the hosts should be
accepted as a hint. There she sits, torn
between duty and inclination, a pitiable
figure. 1 must own that inclination wins, as
a rule. It is good to follow the King, but
nicer to swallow the fizz.
The Australian girls in Cairo had a great
time when the wounded first began to arrive.
They put flowers in the sick quarters, wrote
letters for the injured men, read to them,
and altogether enjoyed themselves. Soon,
however, the wounded began to pour in in
such shoals that the hospitals’ staffs were
unable to cope with the sudden invasion. The
girls promptly bucked in then as nurses.
Sheila Chisholm, the fiancee of young Lough-
borough. was one; Mrs. Sammy Butler was
another, and Alice McCulloch (the sporty,
riding girl) was a third. Leonie Feterson
(who is married to Captain Mackworth) put
her knowledge of yachting to account. She
hired an Arab dhow and took convalescent
men out for sails on the Nile.
The expeditionary force this week acquired
lift. bin. of Rupert Wertheim, son of Hugo,
of Toorak. You will probably remember
Rupert in connection with the international
tennis tournaments. He is a perfectly
heavenly player.
The Dr. Carl Graupner who boasts that
lie can provide the Huns with the most mur-
derous gas on record is an uncle of singer
Flo Graupner, whom Australia took to its
heart long before Armageddon.
Lady Stanley is out, like some beautifully-
dressed little bloodhound, in quest of funds
for our wounded soldiers. She has already
run to earth and pinned most of our patri-
cians. The Best Lady and Mrs. Percy
Russell are inviting people to a Gift tea-
party in the Hawthorn Town Hall on July
24. Visitors will be given free tea on condi-
tion they bring presents for the soldiers.
Aubrey Hoad (son of the departed Major-
General) is in England again. lie was hit
at the beginning of the proceedings in Han-
ders. and was returned to Liverpool Hos-
pital. He went back to the Front on Gen-
eral de Lisle’s staff, and has again been
rather badly smashed up.
While Colonel Harold Grimwade is graft-
ing like a nigger as Chief Embarkation Oflri-
cer, his wife is busy elsewhere in the Y\ ar
cause. She handed fi•> to the Red Cross
Fund as the result of one afternoon’s efforts
in a caul and fleecing party. Two dear old
ladies, friends of the family, served the tea
and sold it for their country’s good at a shil-
ling a. cup. Bun trimmings were extra.
The Bowes-Kellys' eldest son —size six
feet five in his teens —has left Cairo
for one of the Fronts. He only heard
that he had got through his exams, as a
mining engineer three days before he set
sail from Australia as a soldier.
One of our prettiest girls recently con-
ceived the Great Idea of building and
rattling a nightie in aid of the Bed Cross
funds. The garment earned MO pounds in
about a fortnight’s canvass.- Bachelors who
rolled in the shillings are said to be _ in
deadly fear of winning, our bachelors being,
of course, the sort of model young men who
don’t know any girl to whom they could say
frankly, as man to man : "Would you care
for a nightie, old soul? I happen to have
one by me that I have no use for at the
moment.”
One of the medicoes booked to play a part
in the great trouble is Judge Johnston’s
only hope Billy. His late mother was sister
to sporty Donald Wallace, owner of the
immortal Carbine.
Bed tape—or is the need greater now?
Well, listen to this. Nurse Sproule —sister
of the beauteous Dr. Viva Sproule—went to
Egypt to offer her services, as they had been
refused in Victoria. She was politely
received, but those in authority regretted
their inability, etc., and suggested she
should return home and try again. She
did, and was immediately enrolled. In
fact, she sets sail for Egypt next week.
The Mc-Cubbins have heard of their boy
Moppy. lie is in England and is being well
looked after by relatives. He was shot in
the arm one morning, but went on fighting,
and was rewarded with a bullet in the ankle
at midday. That settled him —at any rate,
for the time being.
Mrs. F. W. Fairbairn —the owner of the
two flapper daughters-—will give a Chil-
dren’s Ball in aid of the Wounded Soldiers’
Fund on July Ml. Lady Stanley intends to
personally conduct her daughter (aged
eight) to it. and on that understanding
tickets are being simply grabbed at half a
guinea apiece. The Fairbairn ballroom will
hold 400 or so. and on the same level there
are a billiard room, a drawing-room, a
lounge hall and a supper room, all con-
nected by sliding doors. So you see there
will be plenty of room. Jess Fairbairn is
spending her mornings making caramels and
other sticky things. I suppose they are for
supper. Or maybe the subtle idea is that
the guests, by eating them at an early stage
of the festivities, may have their appetites
so shattered that they will not need any
supper, with beneficial results to the Fund.
Lady Stanley is giving a prize for the best
fancy dress. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme (who
is well up in the ways of small fry) is help-
ing and has also offered a prize. Mrs.
Ernest Whyte has made generous offers, and
so have Mrs. Ed Miller and Miss Ella
Guthrie. There is not to be an age limit.
A “child” may be anything from three to
111 so long as the half-guinea is produced.
Crowds of grown-ups have promised to help
entertain, amongst them Mrs. Grice. Mrs.
George Chirnside, Mrs. Ken McKinnon,
Mrs. Winter Irvine. Miss Byron Moore and
Mrs. Dutton Greene.
The Colonel Bobert Hayes who has been
acclaimed in despatches for his work at
Neuve Clmpelle is a son of G. H. Hayes,
of Caulfield. The father was a flour-miller
with an Irish brogue and a talent for fiery
debate. Colonel Bob married Dean
Macartney’s daughter Kitty. He has been
for years in unpronounceable places in
India, and the white-haired early-Victorian
widow-mother treasures a house full of
Indian goods sent to her by him. One
brother is on the land up Warragul way, and
another is a city grain-broker.
An interesting trio set sail for the U.S.
by the Niagara, namely, Marie Hall, Dr.
Bob Strong and Nicholas Joy. Marie is
going to work at a London hospital. She
doesn’t care what the hospital is or what
work they ask her to do, so long as it is
Work. Dr. Bob intends to labor at trench
sanitation in France, and Nicholas Joy
hopes to find an audience in America for
his special gifts.
Dr. Bob, by the way. was given a rousing
send off on Thursday night. Forty men
stood him a dinner. 11 is great friend
Andrew MeCunn came over a day early, and
then took the, baton at the opening night of
“The Girl on the Film.” One of the inevit-
able gifts was a thermos section flask a
yard or so long by about half a yard wide.
It looked fit to hold hot comforts for at
least 40 wounded men. The staff of tin 1
Theatre Boyal sent a pocket set of surgical
instruments. The guest’s brother Bill, the
lawyer, provided a despatch case. He got
mining-man Percy Cook, who has a gilded
tongue, to make a speech before handing if
over. Alderman Burton —looking most
alluring in a long white set of sideboards —
was in the chair, and Senator Henderson,
a lino, bluff type of Scot, delivered a rousing
address. He put the question so tellingly
for recruits that the dinner party grew furi-
ously enthusiastic. Dr. Amos spoke, and
Dr. Strong responded gracefully, and after
that everything was merry and bright.
From my Adelaide correspondent:
Violet Day and the first public meeting in connec-
tion with Australia Day coincided on Friday. the
meeting was held in the Town Hall, with Acting-
Mayor Prosser as convener, the Governor in the
chair and a miserable attendance. A minimum of
£lOO,OOO is aimed at, and already about £57,000
of that is assured—including a satisfactory bundle of
cheques for £5OO, and one for £2OOO from the
usual Barr Smith source.
Violet Day is an institution whose object is to
commemorate the fallen and help the wounded.
Bunches of violets and small purple badges were sold
in the streets. At the Burra one bunch is said to
have brought £2OO. There was a ceremony at the
South African National Memorial —a. few short
speeches, the Last Post and the Dead March.
A Victoria League Concert, arranged by Nora
Kyffin Thomas and held in Mrs. Percival Stow's draw-
ing-room at Glenelg, brought further cash to the
Wounded Soldiers’ Fund. Other shows, on the same
lines, are to be given in aid of the Red Cross.
Captain Ernest Makin, who has just won the D.S.O.
in France, is the second son of the Frank Makins.
He took his B.A. at Cambridge after leaving St.
Peter’s. In ’99 he entered the Military Staff College
at Camber] ey, and was at first attached to the Man-
chesters. Two of his brothers are at the Front —one
with a British regiment and the other, a doctor,
with a section of the Australian Ambulance. The
A. J. Murrays’ second son, Eric, who went as a
trooper with King Edward's First Horse, has written
from France reporting himself fit, and Mrs. David
Fulton has had a cable from her husband saying
that he had been sent from Malta to England, and
was convalescing with friends in Scotland.
Mr. Collier Cudmore left in the Medina for the
Front. Also, Mr. Cecil Bray, accompanied by a
motor-ambulance, which he will drive if they let
him. His wife, who is a daughter of the late T. R.
Bowman, remains here with the two small daughters.
The Galways arrived from Sydney on Friday.
Admiral Cresswell got here the day before, and
immediately became immersed in naval affairs.
TattersaH’s Club struck pouring rain, and the
lawns at Morphettvillle were like a soiled sponge.
Lovely woman was absent in vast numbers —plain
females in rain-coats being in the ascendancy.
The young Earl of St. Germans is coming here as
A.D.C. to the Galways. He was at the Front with
the Scots Greys, and I never heard of his being
wounded, so why he is leaving the pleasures of com-
bat it is difficult to say. lie is a matrimonial catch
of the highest order, having a couple of beautiful
county seats, a London house, and big revenues.
He is a kinsman, through his mother, of the Labou-
chere family, to which the founder of London Truth
belonged.
The most anguished learner of the news
of the millionaire squatter's re-marriage
will he his brother-in-law. However, his
temperament—l mean, of course, the
brother-in-law’s —is well known to be opti-
mistic (he is known in the servants’ hall as
“All Smiles”), so it is regarded as certain
that he will take the young people to his
heart on his return.
Mrs. Fan-Dango Mackay is giving a hooray
party at Strathnaver on Thursday to her
brilliant step-daughter Elsie. The lovely
young woman has been making a hit on Lon-
don and N’Yark boards. She is here on a
flying visit between engagements.
Mrs. .T. E. Mackay. in mouse-color and
ermine, bad a tea-party at the Repertory
Club on Friday. Of course the guests all
knitted fiercely throughout the meal. Mrs.
Mackay got Marshall Lyle to make a speech
and tell the House just what work these
Repertory Club women are doing. He ex-
pounded many brave deeds, but jibbed at de-
tailing lists of the domestic garments that had
been made. Mrs. Marsh came blushful 1 .. v
into the breach and read' something which
sounded like a laundry bill. Hundreds of
pyjamas, shirts, handkerchiefs, and those
more intimate garments which are affected
by small children. These last are for baby
Belgians. Airs. Jansen tilled in an awkward
pause by singing operatic music, and Florrie
Finn recited a paternal effort, intituled a
“Song of the Sock.” It began “Knit, knit,
knit.” Could you ever have guessed it V
The Turner dame reposed in a scarlet leather
chair. She was clad in pale blue and fur.
with a much-feathered bonnet. Miss Turner
wore a white skirt striped in scarlet, and a
white blouse spotted with the same shouting
color. There were lots of others —but these
stood out as vividly as an oleograph.
Jessie Masson attracted all musical Mel-
bourne to the Assembly Hall last week when
she gave her first recital since her return
from Europe. Despite the fact that she
was caught in Paris by the war, and had
many harrowing experiences there, she
looks as picturesque as Madame Recamier,
and she played like a winged angel. I think
I enjoyed the curve of her back as much
even as I did her playing.
The latest victim to the speedy marriage
germ is Doeie Edgar, of Pine Hill. She
became Mrs. Don Calvert at 10 a.in. last
Thursday. Only a few intimates turned up
to admire her white cloth coat and skirt.
From “Rosna,” in London: —
Margaret Bridge, a Maori Isles maid who was
studying the mending art at the London School of
Medicine for Women, was married recently to
Lieut. Burrows, the son of a Northampton cleric. On
May 27 Beaufort Burdekin, the youngest son of the
late Mrs. Sydney Burdekin, of Sydney, an Oxford
rowing Blue and a subaltern in the Royal Field
Artillery, espoused a pretty Cheltenham girl, Kather-
ine Penelope Cade. He has been wounded, and won’t
be able to get back to his battery for some time.
The other brother, Sydney, who is also a shining
product of Oxford, has been in the firing-line with
the R.F.A. for some time.
The cables say that Mr. William Astor,
the New York millionaire who became an
Englishman, has given his son 7,000,000
dollars, presumably for being wounded in
France. There is a romance lurking in the
background. Young Astor married a widow.
She was a charming and reputable widow,
but the old man was furious, and cut the
youth off with a beggarly £5OOO a yea;'.
Since then he has become a captain in a
Life Guards regiment, and has distinguished
himself in other respects, and his wife has
proved popular; hence the modest amende.
8 w lich used only to be referred to in
polite sassiety at spring-cleaning time (and

a ‘ nne ’ s suggestion that “them new-fangled

Charities outside the war zone have a hard

“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless “fruit” laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels without
griping or discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doing its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit
juices to keep the liver up to its work.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a deliciously
refreshing fruit laxative which is always in
season. You can keep it at hand, and it
will he an unfailing ffiend whenever the
tongue is coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it is needed, as safely
as you could cat fresh fruit. In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared. There is no mistaking
the beneficial effects of “California Syrup
of Figs.” Directions are with it for adults
and children of all ages. This pleasant
laxative is good for all, and cannot possibly
harm even the most delicate, but you must
ask for “California Syrup of Figs.” and look
for the name and trade mark of the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. All leading chemists
sell “California Syrup of Figs.” 1/1 \ and
1/9 per bottle.

“Kodak ; I sat down on a log yesterday
to read about some dashing charge or other, and was
enjoying myself hugely when, over the top edge of
my paper, I caught sight of four large-size soldier
ants creeping- out of their nest in skirmishing order
and making in my direction. I had my penknife
open for pencil-sharpening purposes, and, when the
leading skirmisher came within reach, I made a slash
and divided him just about where his suspenders met
his pants. He staggered out of the narrow trench
the knife-blade had made, and hurried off in two
different directions. The head-end climbed a tree in
haste, while the tail-end, which seemed to be the
more intelligent half, struggled back to the nest and
fell into it. And then J sat and wondered what sort
of a sensation the arrival of half an ant was creating
in the household below. Most probably the warrior’s
flapper daughter, on catching- sight of the half-
tragedy, would fly shrieking: “Moth-er! The last
half of father's just come home! I think something
must have happened to him !”
“Lagani-N.” : Whenever I find myself in
any predicament I reflect upon one Magori, a chief
at Santa-Maria, in the Banks Group. On one occa-
sion there was special need for numbers of a gorgeous
parrakeet; but as it was too early in the season the
natives’ search was very poorly rewarded. Magori,
who had been as diligent and unsuccessful as the
others, made a little, lonesome excursion one after-
noon, and suddenly saw thousands of the parrakeets
swoop and disappear through a small aperture in the
rock in front of him. When he recovered from his
astonishment he put his head through the hole, and
saw that it was the top of a cave, shaped like a
gigantic bottle. He could see myriads of birds preen-
ing their plumage and fluttering about below; but
the sides were so steep and smooth that a roj>e was
necessary to get down to them. Early next day,
wildly elated at his good fortune, Magori sneaked
away with a length of fibre-cord to the bird cave.
Tying an end around a big boulder, he descended
hand under hand, until, when he was still a' good
distance from the bottom, the cord chafed through
against the rocks, and he dropped. It was obvious
that he could not climb out, and as no one knew
of the cave, it looked as though it was the end of the
section for him. Suddenly a bright idea illuminated
the situation. He unravelled the strands of the rope
and broke them into short pieces. At dusk,
when the birds went to sleep, he captured a great
many and tied their legs to his belt, armlets and leg
ornaments. Then, with an almighty yell, he fright-
ened them so that they flew out of the cave, towing
. him with them. When weight exhausted them they
gradually were dragged to earth, whereupon the un-
tutored savage untied himself and escaped. Magori
died, of course, ages ago ; but the cave is still shown
as evidence of the bona-fides of this legend.
* * * *
“The Reefer” : One afternoon I rode into
Saroka (Papua), and all the natives except one
scurried into their huts. The exception was a maid
of about 16 years, who, clad in nothing more than
tattooing, came smiling to greet me. The horse was
even more upset about it than I was, and reared on
liis hind legs, snorting his disapproval. Unabashed,
the simple child of nature persisted in confronting
us, and, stepping close, began caressing my leg.
Thereupon some women rushed forth and bustled her
away. When my blushes vanished I inquired, and
was told that the girl was kava-Teava (mad). Lunacy
is uncommon amongst Papuans, but whereyer I hap-
pened across an idiot I found him (or her) un-
clothed. Yet they don’t seem badly treated, and
their fellows fend for them. If ’tis true that “the
eyes are the index to the soul,” then the sweetest
soul I’ve ever met was that simple girl of Saroka.
* * Ac Ac
“Pica de Vinne” : At the old mission at
Poonindie (S.A.), now the home of a wealthy squat-
ter, J. D. Bruce, the church with a chimney, where
the niggers used to worship, still stands. The mis-
sion was founded by Bishop Hale (later Bishop of
Perth) in ’5O. One spiritual adviser to the natives
was murdered on the neighboring Tod River by a
section of his flock,, and the other section erected a
tomb over the remains. Local burial involved many
ceremonies round a pit 5x5, the dead being placed
head to the west —a custom founded on the belief
that the soul went east to Boston Island.
PRINCIPLE AND INTEREST.
"I tell you I won't give you anything! I never subscribe to these things, on principle.”
“How do you spell it?”
NO CONSIDERATION FOR A TIRED MAN’S FEELINGS.
THE ONE WITH THE JOB: “Low-minded, mean feller in charge o' this job, I can tell
y er.”
THE OTHER ONE: “Yes?”
THE ONE WITH THE JOB: “Yes. Actually been an' took the legs orf the wheclborrer,
so's a cove can't sit down an’ have a rest.”
“Silas Snell” : Andy Mann was out hunt-
ing honey. His methods were simple. He tracked
the busy bee to its family tree, and then sampled
the gum-butt with an auger. If the butt exuded
bees when tapped the axe was brought into requisi-
tion, and Andy went home with his load. He went
home with his load on the occasion I have particu-
larly in mind, and he secured it in this way. He
came upon a tree that “had bees,” rigged his staging
at a suitable elevation, and got going with the auger.
When the hole was about 4in. in the miracle hap-
pened—a strange, dark, odorous' fluid began to ooze
forth. The smell seemed familiar to Andy, the taste
was inviting. “Glory be!” said Andy, “’tis it, and
no mishtake.” Andy tasted again. “Never a doubt,
’tis it,” said he; and Andy Mann went for the honey-
buckets in his trap. He went with some velocity,
for meanwhile precious fluid was escaping. Standing
by with his buckets Mann drew the auger forth. The
implement was followed by a gush of liquor. He
filled one bucket, and half-filled the other. So it
happened that Andrew Mann went home with his
load, shouting hilariously, with one full bucket and a
second bucket still containing a pint or more. The
liquor in Andy’s buckets was rum; the liquor in
Andy was good old Jamaica. “Where did I get it?”
said Andy the King when the men of Dare pressed
him with questions. “Sure, don’t I know where it
growst” A bucket of rum takes a deal of drinking,
even when the consumer has a thirst such as Andy
Mann was endowed with, but Andy emptied the uten-
sil in due course, and then gave himself sagely to
thinking. “Where there’s wan bucket iv rum,” said
he, “there’s more, maybe. Fer whoi not?” Andrew
went again to the mysterious tree where the rum
grew, and he took with him a rubber tube. He in-
serted the tube far into the auger hole, and he
sucked. There were immediate results. The results =
were rum. Andy clung to the gum-butt, sucking, till
the time was ripe. Then he fell off, and slept the
sleep of the unjust at the foot of the tree ; for suck-
ing maketh a full man. Again; Maun went home
to the township of Dare, rocking drunk and odorous
of rum, boasting aloud of his discovery of the marvellous
tree which when tapped spouted inexhaustible rum.
>So it happened that when he went again to quench
his thirst at his artesian well there were those who
stole after him, and when he had filled himself, and
fallen off glutted, Corcoran took the tube from him,
and tried his luck. “Holy murther!” said he, “’tis
a fact; tis wan iv thim bottle trees I've
bin readin’ of.” Corcoran sucked till he fell,
and Mcßride took over Hie tube, and sucked
for five minutes before making his terrible
announcement. “She’s gone dthry on me,” said
he. Alas, it was only too true —Andy Mann’s
miracle tree was exhausted. “I’ve offended the
saints,” said lie. “ ’Tis a judgment on me. I'll
never again find annother tree where the rum grows,
and all me life I'll be seckin’ it now.” But Andy
was spared a lifelong quest. Ilis companions cut open
the tree, and found a fat barrel jammed high up in
the hollow butt, where it had been placed long, long
ago by some sly-grogseller of the roaring days of
Pancake Flat. This simple explanation of the mys-
tery nearly broke the heart of Mann, and he aban-
doned honey-hunting-. “ ’Tis a poor wake thing,
honey is,” he said, “to wan who fer a whole week
bilaved truly he’d found the tree would give rum,
’n’ dramed iv himsilf wid a tap in the butt, sellin’
rum two-shillin’ the bucket V the mortal end iv his
days.”
“Outcast” : A few genuine cases of leprosy
have been diagnosed in but Fiji is the locale
par excellence of the disease in the Western Pacific.
In Fiji good authorities have stated that not less
than 1 per cent, of the native population is affected,
and native opinion is absolutely firm on the idea that
leprosy is both contagious and, in a. sense, hereditary,
in so far as it tends to cling about certain families.
REPROVED.
THE CUSTOMER: “I sec nothing here that I
am in the habit of taking.”
W AITRESS: “This ’ere is a, boarding 'ouse,
not a bar.”
In native belief, as might be" expected, leprosy is
due to an evil spirit; and since the disease is inherent
in certain families, the particular evil spirit is a sort
of hereditary retainer. Certain stones are pointed out
as the spirits’ shrines, and nearly all these stones are
vested in certain families. . The owners have the
ability to let loose the power of the stones for pur-
poses of injuring an enemy or for a fee, if other
people do not possess a handy little thing like a
leprosy spirit.

THE BALLAD OF THE BUMPKIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oil, I thought 1 was sick of the country, and 1
wanted a trip to town.
1 was tired of my own make of blouses, and I wanted
an up-to-date gown.
1 detested the smell of the cowyard, I hated the
sight of a sheep,
I was weary of washtubs and wringers, and the
thought of a churn made me weep.
I have had my stay in the city. I am hurrying home
again now,
And each turn of the wheels takes me farther from
the rush and roar and the row.
For the shriek of the tram-4 round the corners, and
the squeal of the brakes all the night,
And the roar of the trains and the crash of the
carts made a Hell of each day and each night.
B hv, I’d rather be chased round the cowyard by a
bull than cross lving-street again,
And I’d sooner walk light through our pigsty than
the Quay after two points of rain.
For the smell of our cowyard is sweeter than the
reek as a motor goes by,
While to turn my churn’s handle brings butter, but
the telephone’s brings no reply.
And I’ll have to make up some more blouses, and
my gown—l must do without that,
For they sold me a bob's worth of velvet, and called
it a two-guinea hat.
And I paid one-and-six for my lunches—just a couple
of chops and some bread—
You get nothing for nothing in Sydney—and it’s four

So I’m hurrying home to the country by the very-

And to-morrow the roosters will wake me, just as soon

EXTRACT FROM OUR LONDON LETTER:
....“The market is bare of goods of every description. .. .
as small parcels come round they are eagerly sought for. . . .
PRICE IS NO OBJECT TO-DAY; the only thing is to get
goods. The Woollen Trade cannot get orders executed by
manufacturers. In fancy goods they have to be content
with the left-over goods from last year’s stocks. .. .The
prudent man will buy now what he may need months hence.
If he is wise he will even order at once his next Winter
Overcoat. .. .The present state of affairs is one which has
never before been known in the trade.... Prices are still
soaring, and, as far as we can foresee, will be doubled within
the next six months.”

RECIPE FOR BALD HEADS
Well-known Politician Nearly Bald.
Now Has New Growth of Hair.
Tells How He Did It.
A popular politician, well-known on ac-
count of his baldness and his ready wit, sur-
prised his friends by appearing with a new
growth of hair. Many of his friends did
not know him, and others thought he had a
wig. On being asked how he did it, lie made
ihe following statement: “I attribute the
growth of my hair to the following simple
recipe, which any lady or gentleman can mix
at homo. To a half-pint of water add loss,
of bay rum. a small box of Orlex 'Compound
and Joof glycerine. Apply to the scalp
Iwo or three times a week with the finger
tips." It not only promotes the growth of
the hair, but removes dandruff, scalp humors
and prevents the hair from falling out. It
darkens streaked, faded, grey hair and makes
the hair soft and glossy. These ingredients
can be purchased at any chemist's at very
little cost and mixed at home.* [7

‘“Koroma’’: -V vegetable which sprouts in
portions of the magnificent karri forests of Groper -
land deserves a word or two. It is known as banyan
shrub, and at its tallest reaches an altitude of 12ft.
It possesses no limbs, having only a dense growth
of whiskers at the extreme top, and, in consequence,
(lie bark of the stem, which strips easily, can be
obtained in fair lengths free from flaws. It is
mighty tough bark, and when slowly dried can be
twisted into all shapes without breaking-. 1 have
seen ropes, reins, bridles and stirrup-straps made of
thin, plaited strips of it, and mighty good specimens
they were. I know of a bridle and reins made of
the vegetable which have been in fairly constant use
for over a year, and show no marks of senile decay,
“Pick”: “Lou” says (B. 6/5/’l5) that
stinking- gidya is the best burning wood in Aus-
tralia. It depends upon what for and where the
burning is done. If the only qualifications re-
quired are those claimed by “Lou” for his (or is it
he?) nomination, viz., simply being consumed to a
white ash, then there are dozens of Australian woods
that will equally well fill the bill. But if porsist-
ent, business-like burning is a consideration, I will
back spotted gum to keep going- against anything
this side of the furnaces of Tophet. I have seen
spotted gum logs glowing fiercely and continuously
I hroughout a week's incessant rain, and stumps will
smoulder away to the farthermost extremity of then-
roots. for heating purposes, furnace and boiler
men who use wood prefer stringy bark, and for
volume of blaze there is no vegetable that can outdo
half-dry turpentine.
THE SENSIBLE COURSE.
BILL: "I see 'eve a young bloke I know ’as
gone an’ committed suicide.”
GEORGE: "Silly blighter, when ’e could ’vc
gone to the war an’ died a ’ero."
•Taenia": The only wild Australian that
cannot swim is the wombat. When hunted into water
lie makes no effort to keep afloat, but plunges down
and crawls along the bottom, lie can cover 50yds. in
quick time, too. The porcupine, if placed in water,
will also proceed to the bottom, but rises to the sur-
face immediately upon discovering that it is not in
a small pool. Speaking of porcupines, lias any Abo-
ite noted the giant flea peculiar to the spiked beast?
A LAST REQUEST.
DAD COCKY: "Bury me in ther con-yard, Maria, so's I kin hear ’em milkin'.”
Hay : One day, back in the early ‘7o\s,
wlien the first camel train arrived at Bimbowrie
station, in the nor’-east of S. Aus., on its way to one
'n Elder, Smith and C'o.’s runs, I had been working
with other hands some distance from the homestead.
Coming home we were met by one of the blacks
(there were about 150 on the station, the storekeeper
being Government protector at that time). He was
in a great state of excitement, and loudly and impress-
’v<'h informed us that “Plenty emu horse alonga
station.” “You’re cranky,” was the reply; “there’s
no such thing.” “All right,” he said vvarninglv.
on look out, cnlti nahntoo [emu horse] walk
about like that,” and he began to imitate the gait of
an emu in a life-like way, his face expressing the
utmost gravity. Before he had finished his perform-
ance half a dozen more blacks arrived, and they all
began to prance solemnly round like emus, each with
an elegant Grecian bend. We were completely mys-
tified, until at last one inspired artist suddenly re-
membered the name of the mysterious animals, and
lie y elled out: “That fellow name canibelco, cam-
beloo. Of course, we dropped to it at once. The
10 camels and their four Afghan drivers camped for
the night between the station and the blacks’ camp,
and so distrustful were the ahos. of the strange dark
men who wore no “prowsers” and of their uncanny
emu horses that they were afraid to pass them in order
to reach their own camp. A deputation asked the-
manager to allow them to camp close to the home-
stead so that they might be ‘near the white men
the} knew and understood. In tile morning when the
camel-drivers asked for a guide to the next water no
amount of persuasion or bribes of tobacco would in-
duce any of the blacks to accompany the Afghans a
foot of the way.
( ourri : The boss of the up-country
pub, who bail a store as an aid to revenue, waa
staggered the other day when a whiskery individual,
being shouted for by another of the grass-seed
brotherhood, said sensibly: “Well, I don’t feel dry;
I'll take a tin of jam.”
Adelaide Register (10/0/T5) has a story
from Robe (S.A.) and vouched for ns true. The
hake Eliza station-master’s daughter, aged 14, ran
down an emu, then dismounted to keep the dog's off,
and finally took a fancy, to sit astride the exhausted
bird ; on which it suddenly, recovered its energy, and
ran a mile with her across rough country before she
could get a strangle-hold to work on its neck. Net
results: Emu allowed to recover its wind and escape;
lady with scratched legs ; unknown number of Bitterlv
disappointed dogs.

"Boigbeat”: As the outcome of studying
inland seagulls or seagulls inland it appears to me
(hat the birds frequent only salt lakes. For years
prior to last winter numbers of small silver gulls
med to spend the winter months, and up to about
the end of September, on Lake Tyrrell, in the Vic-
toria n Malice. As far as I could ascertain they used
to breed on the small islands which are scattered
over- the lake. Last winter not a single gull put in
an appearance, and it would seem that they had some
foreknowledge of the drought which was then getting
ready. Their favorite pastime was following the
plough and picking up grubs and such-like game.
Towards summer, when the plough and the cultivator
ceased operations, the birds infested the town for a
few weeks prior to their departure, raising an awful
din in their scrap for scraps. I have seen numbers
captured by means of a piece of fat tied to the
centre of a small round piece of tin made fast to a
length of string. An old gull-fisher told me they go
well boiled in treacle.
“Kia-kaka” : This was the dumper-building
recipe of “Scotty the Wrinkler,” than whom there
was none better at flour-manipulating in the lm-ii.
He told the wallaby-trackers to mix a. teaspoonful of
salt and a tablespoonful of “jump-up” into two
pannikins of flour, and, after carefully stirring the
dry ingredients, to mix in one pannikin of lukewarm
water, knead the whole into a stiff dough, place on
white-hot embers, cover with same, and hake one hour.
"Wandi” : A 20-montks-okl infant bad
wandered from his father’s camp at Koseue'atli, Movce
district (N.S.W.), about noon, and soon many search-
ers were at work. The- father followed the little
fellows tracks for nearly a mile, and then could find
no further trace of him. When the case seemed hope-
less for that night two black-trackers, Jacky Stacey
and Have Combadello, became energetic, and, in the
moonlight, picked up the tracks, followed
them for five miles, and found the child
standing beside a tree.. I have noticed
that when a white’eliild is lost in the bush
the thoughts of the anguished mother at
once fly to the blaektracker. Though a
hundred white men might be searching
she feels more confident if there is an abo.
tracker among them. .Many a young life
lias been saved by his expert bushcraft
and keenness of vision, his patience in fol-
lowing the trail over miles of country
where his white companions could see no
trace. And the track tells him more than
the direction in which the missing one
has gone. A little girl named Jessie
Brooks was lost for three days near Hcr-
ffot.t Springs, Central Australia, in May,
1911. For 20 miles the tracker followed
her footsteps over stony and rough, slaty
country, minutely describing at intervals
ler actions and her condition. “She sit
down and play here.... Boot hurt —
limpin’ little bit Gettin’ very tired.
Took her boots off and put them on again.
....Picked up a stick.... Sleep here.
Lookin’ for water now Nearly knocked up.”
And so on until lie came up with her. The child
subsequently verified the statements of the tracker
in every detail.
“Ikikki : While on the subject of u.-itive
currency in the Pacific Islands (B. 18/-5/T5), is it
generally known that the porpoise teeth which- are
used in the Solomons and other groups have been sent
in large quantities from Sydney after being collected
off Port Jackson Heads? The porpoises are followed
up, in their regiment-like charges after fisli, by a
launch, which does not seem to scare them, for they
will obligingly swim close alongside, and are har-
pooned. The teeth of a well-grown fish are worth
about a pound. Lever Bros, used to buy the ivory
(they still may do so) and trade it off for
copra. Two years ago there were three launches
working from Watson's Bay. Duimo what the pre-
sent position of the industry is.
.1 lie overseer's ,v;irn
t was out horse-hunting one day when a bis storm
came on, and L crawled into a hollow log for shelter.
, -V cattle-pup came after me and coiled up on my
legs. The storm lasted a good while, and 1 fell
asleep. While ! was that way a carpet-snake came
in and swallowed my pup. In searching for a warm
jilaee for a nap it took a couple of coils round my
fog's. At this point there came in a wet and drip-
pmg bandicoot. The snake promptly seized and
swallowed him too. Now, these animals made a
considerable bulge at each end of that snake, and
as the intervening portion of its body was round my
legs, it could go neither forward nor backward, and
the effort to get the bandicoot down to the pup re-
sulted in niv legs being bound tightly together. In
this predicament I woke, and. though I risked being
bitten, I was too tightly jambed by the coil and the
protuberances to force a way out. Not having a
knife it seemed evident that I must lie there until
either the pup or the bandicoot digested. But I
hadn’t seen the worst of things yet. Towards noon
a gohanna crawled in and swallowed my right foot
and part of the leg; and by and bye its mate came
along and swallowed the other foot and leg. Having
strong boots on tin 1 only inconvenience I experienced
was a feeling of tightness. But the question pre-
sented itself: Would my feet digest in the gohannas
before the'pup or bandicoot was assimilated in the
snake? 1 was debating this point when there came
a sound of chopping, and half an hour later a big
tree soused down on the head end of my log, split-
ting it from end to end. I escaped with sundry
bruises, several small cuts, and much shock. Two
axemen stood by the stump, and when they saw me
suddenly arise from the debris, girdled with a bulged
snake and with gohanna extremities, they pelted for
their lives. ! shook the snake off without any
trouble ; but to get free of the gohannas I had to
tie their tails to a sapling and run backwards.

“Flinderino”: A favorite food of the
coastal blacks of North Queensland is what they
call wirrell. It is not unlike a pearl oyster, only
smoother and smaller. At low tide the niggers,
young and old, wander out into the Pacific and
.search with their toes for the tucker, sometimes cover-
ing several acres of mud and sand tints before filling
their dillybags. This shellfish is more plentiful from
May to August, during which months it comes close
inshore. Bingin' cooks him by standing him on
edge against a circle of stones around the tire, and
ho gapes when he thinks he is done. WirrelN
caught out of season cause violent illness, and the
sufferer is usually' overcome with a desire to eat.
sand, gravel or grindstones. Pickled in vinegar at;
the right time they are not to be sneezed at.
“Outcast'’: When a nigger dies up on
the N.E. coast of Papua his next-of-kin and other
relatives go through a pretty severe course of treat-
ment to show that their grief isn't pure bunkum. In
addition to a daily smearing with fresh mud from
head to foot, all sorts of nice things to eat are tabu.
such as pork, bananas, sago and cocoa mils, and even
water. As. tin's tabu has to he kept up for as Jong
as a twelvemonth sometimes, the restricted diet,
becomes monotonous. The only way out of the tabu
is to kill somebody. Once that desirable end is
attained, Brown Brother can kill Ids pigs, smoke
tobacco, put on new clothes, and generally liven up
things, iif course, if the killing is done by the other
fellow the arrangements are a bit upset.

THE PERFECT WASHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We hired a maid the other day,
A red-haired lass from Oldham town,
In Lancashire; and people say
The place enjoys world-wide renown
•'"or that fine virtue which we stress
As coming next to godliness.
She told us she could wash and sew ;
As laundress she had not her peer.
W'o took her to our hearts, and, lo!
The' beauty, bless her, still is here,
And for a week her roasted meat
Not dog nor eat has deigned to eat!
Ai washing- she to greatness rose,
W e'd been assured. Remained this hope.
She filled the boiler up with clo’es,
Then added six good pounds of soap ;
Next with a fire beneath the pot
To odorous hash she burned the lot !
We gazed upon the ruin wrought.

Expressed succinctly every thought.

Why Sore Throat is so Prevalent
THESE three striking illustrations
reveal at once the reason why
Sore Throat, in all its varied,
painful and depressing forms, including
Tonsilitis, is so common a complaint;
how it may be readily cured, on the one
hand, and effectually prevented on the
other.
Sore Throat and Tonsilitis, with
other infectious diseases, like Diph-
theria, Scarlet Eever, Measles. Mumps,
Whooping-cough and Consumption, are
due to germs. These float in the air,
settle and develop in the throat. In
vigorous health they are destroyed by
the blood. If, however, the individual
is below par the blood is not able to
contend against the rapidity with which
the germs multiply, and he gets the
disease whose germs he has inhaled.
During the winter disease-germs are
particularly prevalent, for the weather
conditions are then most favorable to
their growth. People with Sore Throat
and Tonsilitis, those sickening for the
diseases already mentioned, and con-
valescents from them, are constantly
passing through the streets, and going
to theatres, music-halls, concerts and
other public gatherings. Not only do
they exhale germs which infect the aii,
but they carry a great deal of dust with
them. The dust particles, like the
sooty particles in fogs, act as rafts to
float the germs into the throat.
It is obvious, therefore, that these
germs must be destined to prevent
them destroying ns.
Their enormous number is suggested
by Figs. 1 and 2.
Fig. 1 represents a microscope plate
which was exposed for a short time to
the air and afterwards kept for two
the blurred and fainter markings being
the particles of dust themselves.
Fig. 3 is a similarly-exposed plate
which was previously disinfected with
saliva containing Form am in t, the pleas-
ant-tasting throat tablet which a phy-
sician, writing in one of the leading
medical periodicals, recently declared
was “Unquestionably the germ-de-
Fig. 1. How air germs develop in two days.
Fig. 2. How dust germs develop in two days.
Fig. 3. How Formamint prevents any development of air and dust germs.
days at the temperature of the human
body. The white dots represent the
growth of colonies of germs, seen under
the microscope. Each dot contains
thousands of germs.
Fig. 2 is a similar plate exposed to
fine dust and treated in the same way.
The colonies of germs carried by it are
seen as the white patches on the plate,
stroyer of tlie age.” The power of
Formamint Tablets is adequately proved
by the fact that neither from the air
nor from the dust were any germs able
to develop. In other words, Forma-
mint completely killed all the germs.
It is therefore, a trustworthy cure for
Sore Throat, and a complete preventive
of diseases whose germs multiply in the
throat.
The highest medical testimony en-
dorses these statements of the efficacy
of the preparation. The Chief Medical
Officer of one of onr largest Infectious
Diseases’ Hospitals states in one of the
leading medical journals, “I have never
had Sore Throat myself since I began
to use Formamint Tablets, although I
suffered periodically before.”
Another physician writes in the
Practitioner : “Having tried all the
British Pharmacopoeia lozenges, and
most of the well-known proprietary
antiseptic lozenges, I have become re-
duced to one, and one only (for sore
throat), namely, Formamint.” Ovei
ten thousand, doctors have have also
written describing the remarkable
results they have obtained in curing the
various forms of Sore Throat and Ton-
silitis, and preventing the diseases men-
tioned above, by Formamint Tablets.
Of all Chemists, price 2/6 per bottle.
All imitations of Formamint are
worthless. Insist on having genuine
Formamint.
Prove its value for yourself by wilt-
ing to-day for a Free Sample to The
Formamint Co., 17 Bond Street, Syd-
ney, N.S.W., mentioning Tiie
Bulletin* and enclosing two penny
stamps towards postage. An inter-
esting and instructive Booklet will also
be sent, which contains vital informa-
tion to all who suffer with their throats.
Formamint is Entirely British-Made

“No,” said the tired little woman with
the bruised eye, “I ! m not wot you’d call
musical; but I wouldn’t never be without a
planner. W’en my man gits that way ®
must ’it something, and a pianner can stan

She sighed heavily and stowed her market-

pianner till l’d took it.” #
“E.T.”: Frucera was attacked first, and
went down after a feeble resistance. Then
Marmite, Bromose and Granola were suc-
cessfully taken. Gluten and Nuttolene were
not so easy, but perseverance finally won
the day. Granose and Frotose proved fairly
formidable, but were “mopped up” at the
finish. Then Zwieback was taken at a gulp,
so to speak, and we were ready for Mel-
sitor. This is not an extract from a sol-
dier’s letter about Gallipoli. I am. only
giving details of my first vegetarian dinner.

“Louis St”: Advocacy of the use. of Aus-
tralian-made goods is bearing . fruit. My
friend went to a draper’s shop in a Sydney
suburb to buy children’s socks. A package
labelled “Made in Australia” attracted at-
tention, and she cheerfully paid the extra
price demanded. Branded on the .heel of
each sock was the legend “Made in Eng-
land.” How souls are damned in business!
* * * *
“S.H.W.”: That yarn of “Yarrum’s” in. a
recent Bulletin, that the Australian police
baton is made of compressed leather, is
romance. The samples that I have met ar»
made of common fiddle-back, 18 inches (not
10) in length, and shaped at the end noth-
ing like the Kaiser’s top-piece. The only
thing at all German about them is their
shape: they are like a long sausage. Also,
the thong at the handle end is not passed
round the wrist, but across the back of the
hand and looped over the thunm. That’s
the Victorian baton; and, Premier Holman
notwithstanding, Victoria is part of Aus-
tralia.
* * * *
“T.1I.”: The little that has been done
near Adelaide demonstrates that we have
ideal land to produce olives that would, by
quality alone, secure the patronage of over-
seas markets. In spite of the fact that there
is little attempt at scientific pruning and
manuring, a ton of South Aus. olives pro-
duces an average of 3G7lb. of oil, compared
with 3301 b. from the French-grown fruit
picked in the most favorable part, of the
season. The average production in Aus-
tralia for the past four years has been
10,200 gallons, whilst an average of GO,OOO
gallons has had to be imported to fulfil
local requirements, and often inferior im-
ported stuff—sometimes not olive oil at all —
i 3 blended with the Australian product, to
the injury of the good name of the local
article. Despite the fact that the Australian
workman receives twice the wages of the
French, and works only two-thirds of the
hours, there is good money in the business.
The big -trouble is that it isn’t quick money.
In South Aus. trees don’t come to fall matu-
rity for about 25 years; but at 60. some of
them are still in full bearing—outliving the
French trees by many years, and thus fur-
ther advertising the merits of the Australian
climate.

“Hamer”: Fishermen are wondering
whether the N.S.W. State trawlers are
going to catch schnapper in any quantity.
The number so far netted has been incon-
siderable, the reason being that the trawls
have been made over a clear bottom, while
the schnapper is a reef-haunter. Local
fishermen declare that the trawlers have no
chance of snaring Australia’s favorite sea-
fruit; but the men on the trawlers are bet-
ting upon their success. They claim posses-
sion of a patent for making the net steeple-
chase over rocks, by means of reels which
travel up and down precipitous places.
Meanwhile the schnapper is reported to be
taking a lively interest in the proceedings
through a periscope.
* * * *
“Momus”: A tale of how to get rich was
told by a Mr. Moroney recently at the Aus-
tral Salon, Melbourne, when lecturing on
Early Melbourne. The first land sale was
held in June, 1537, the terms for each block
being £2 2s. deposit, balance in two months.
The sole condition was that a substantial
building had to be up within two years.
Mick Pender bought a block at the corner of
Collins and Queen streets for £4O. lie held
it for 40 years and sold to the Bank of
Australasia in 1877 for £33.000. The auc-
tioneer of the ’3o’s, ILoddle. was paid his
commission by a block in Elizabeth-street,
between Bourke and Little Collins. . Tom
Brown gave £4l for a corner of Collins and
Elizabeth. The land ivns sold at the close
of the land boom in 1803 for £275.000 to
the Equitable of New York, and its building
cost £160.000. Old Bill Ilowey. the potato
farmer from Parramatta, gave £94 for three
blocks opposite tlie Town Ilall. They now
bring in £40,000 a year rent. Collins-street
is full of romances. It is not too much to
say that half the big fortunes of Victoria
have been made out of the rise in land
values. But shall wo repeat them? Federal
and State taxation operate powerfully to
prevent it. Nevertheless money will be
made out of those city parts which are now
just outside the real business area, and are
occupied by decrepit little shops and dwell-
ings. Sydney, which has had very great
expansion in the last eight years, has seen
hundreds of such hutches wiped out and
lofty warehouses and factories put in their
place; and in Melbourne there will be the
same pushing out beyond Bourke-street
presently.

“Pick": Someone again suggests (B.
17/6/T5) that, to increase our beefsteak and
lower its price, the Government should pro-
hibit the slaughter of calves. It is up to
the aforesaid someone to propound how the
Government is going to do it. Certainly
an Act might make it penal to assassinate a
calf; but what Act can stop the cow-wor-
shipper from letting the progeny of his god-
dess pass out for want of shelter and proper
feeding? The rearing of calves is a problem
that every dairyman has figured out. He
knows that it is unprofitable. Either whey
or separated milk is unsuitable > food tor
calves, unless mixed with a certain propor-
tion of good milk, and good milk is worth
anything up to 10 H per gallon. To make
young stock profitable, the dairyman esti-
mates that he would have to get upwards of
£7 10s. per head for the beasts as tlnee-ycai
olds. _ , *
“T O.I.”: The first library of any note
sold in'Australia was that of .T. T. Camp-
bell, one-time Secretary to Governor
Macquarie, who died m ISoO- ine saic
took Q place on April 8 and 9 in that year
Auction sales at night are now prohibited ,
but Mr. Bodenham, the auctioneer, # disposed
of Campbell’s books in the evenings. A
paragraph in the Sydney Gazette of the
time reads: —
The attendance at the Book Sale, _ held at Mr.
Bodenham’s Rooms on Thursday evening, was very
numerous and of the greatest respectability. Amongst
others was his Excellency’s nephew, Aide de Camp,
and many officers of both regiments The sale did
not terminate until a quarter to 12. Our readers
will perceive by an advertisement on this page that
the sale will be renewed this evening at 7 o clock
precisely.
“His Excellency” was Italph Darling, and
his nephew was Henry Charles
afterwards Governor of Victoria in 1860-66,
66, and recalled over the famous deadlock.

“R. 8.”: No wonder the German scorns
the British “shopkeeper”! Before the war
Holland was an exporter of cocoa to Eng-
land; since July, 1914, she has become an
importer. Everybody knows where that
cocoa goes. In the three months fol-
lowing the removal of the restriction on
export of tea 16,000,0001 b. left England for
friends or neutrals, of course. For the cor-
responding period of 1913 the exports, were
only 1,146,0001 b. In Aug.-Sept. of 1913 Ger-
many bought 1.000,0001 b. of tea from
land; in Aug.-Sept., 1914, Holland s sales
to Germany were 16,000,0001 b. As tor
English exporters, well —Dr. Johnson } -
marked on. a certain kind of patriotism being
the refuge of scoundrels.

•‘Loco”: That yarn about the boy who
started to walk round the Geelong-Ballarai
tailway (B. 27/5/T5) reminds me. A loco,
driver on that line one night lost his pocket-
knife off the engine. He pulled up Ins train
and searched for it unsuccessfully. Ketuin-
ing next morning, as the line repairers weie
getting to work, he stopped at two or three
gangs and told them about it, giving details.
Next day, and for several days, he pulled up
to get the weapon. Meeting With no Wck,
he continued throwing notes to the men ro
a month. But he never got the kmte, .
now says line-repairers are a lot ot biann.

“Rag”: There are at present several popu-
lous public works camps within a few
hours’ train-journey of Sydney, and regu-
larly on the Friday preceding pay, spielers
honor them with their presence to take
charge of two-up schools on Saturday and
Sunday. It is quite ordinary for three or
four of these parasites to whack up OU or
70 pounds out of “the boxers” which they
appropriate for “ring-keeping.” The crowd
have two-headed and two-tailed pennies
(known as “grays”), which they introduce
as opportunity offers. Those up. in the
game may notice the manipulation and
refrain from betting; but there are always
mugs who get caught. It may seem extra-
ordinary that a few crooks can do such
tilings to a mob of navvies without getting
hurt; but mobs are mostly unconcerned
about individual quarrels. Besides, the
crooks are almost invariably ex-prizefighters.
So, instead of interfering when tlie “shrew-
dies” lamb down a neophyte, the crowd
deems discretion much more comfortable
than valor. But there is no excuse for the
authorities, and it’s up to them to spring off
their tails.
* * * *
“Nobby”: This talk about the . profits
sawmillers are making out of building-tim-
ber is mostly rot. Observe the cost of pro-
ducing timber in a bush mill: Gutting logs,
9d.; hauling, 4s. 9d.; royalty, 6d. per hun-
dred super feet: total, 6s. per hundred, log
measurement. There is about 40 per cent,
waste in sawdust and edgings, which brings
the cost up to Bs. sd. Mill cutting (os.),
carting to rail (45.), and freight on rail
(about 25.) make the cost at Sydney lis.
5d As I understand the timber merchants
pay 14s. 6d. per 100, there is a loss of about
2s. lid. on building timber. But the mill
keeps going because building timber is. only
cut out of waste after the special railway
timber, for which a fancy price is paid, is
deleted. Of course, there are mills that can
produce building timber at a profit, but
they are generally in a position to obtain
logs cheap by rail or water. On the other
hand, they do not get logs good enough for
special-order timber.
THE ESCAPED FOWL OF ROMANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mourn for Romance 1 Romance is fled !
With hills the tradesmen bashed its head.
We pelted it with pounds and pence,
Till, like a fowl, it flew the fence.
It braved the gale, but home finance
Dismayed and scared our young Romance.
Mourn for Romance 1 It is no more 1
Its feathers litter stove and floor.
The baby seized it by the head
And filed its wings with crusts of bread.
Squawking, it took a desp’rate chance,
And so flew free. Farewell, Romance l
Romance is gone 1 But why complain ?
Some other kids from wind and rain
Will guard it'well. It never dies,
But from each house in turn it flies.
Romance, my dear, has taken wing!
Don’t cry t We couldn’t feed the thing!

.As a. young- man ex-Speaker Mason
(Vic.) was schoolmaster on the training
ship Nelson. He got into Parliament at
the same time as Bent. The boorish market-
gardeuer and he were the two sensations of
that general election—one beat Mieliie and
the other beat the still greater Iliginbotham.
“W.T.8.” from London:—
A death-knell was sounded tliis week, when the
effeets of the City Athenaeum Club, in Angel Court,
were sold under the hammer. More familiarly known
as “The Thieves’ Kitchen,” this club saw light in the
Kaffir boom of 1895. It has at one time or another
included amongst its members all the big- mining
financiers, and some gigantic share deals have been
arranged within its walls. Barney Barnato and his
satellites had a playful little way of “tossing for
fivers” there, but tiie favorite gamble was over a
game of dominoes. Eugene Coni, the boxing- referee,
on a single game saw a bet of £lOOO. Lionel Robin-
son, the biggest operator Australia has contributed to
London, was often to be seen at the club, especially
when “Kangaroos” were enjoying themselves, while
another guest who often figures in “Wild Cat” pars.,
Hermann Landau, of the Associated Northern and
Associated, was a familiar figure to all the members,
The worthy Hermann’s visits to town are less fre-
quent of late, for now that he has blossomed out as
a Buckinghamshire squire he finds the call of the
country more enticing than the city, especially while
share deals are very much off. Of his little shooting-
narties and the pomp and ceremony of the estab-
lishment some screaming tales are told.
William McLinen proposes that meetings
shall be held throughout the country to
denounce the unnecessary intrusion ot local
political strife into the c-ouncilsi ofl the Com-
monwealth S ofkSu
Ihe excuse is that, wh 1 ■ '' ®
“the'mother country,” the' Aus
tralian Government is preparing to intro-
duce “controversial and Socialistic legisla-
tion.” The reason why political controversy
is more or less stilled in the United Kin-g-
-dom may be found in its almost complete
freedom from McLinens and Cooks. It cer-
tainly has nothing to do with the absence of
revolutionary legislation and administra-
tion. The Asquith Government has simply
heaped Socialism upon Britain in the past
six months; and there is more promised,
And no public meetings have been called by
prominent politicians on Imperial and pacific
grounds to denounce the changes. The
Australian Government, which has charge of
the war at this end, is asking, in the Ilet'er-
enda, no more than the powers which the
British Government has been exercising ever
since the war began. It suggests an inter-
esting problem. Are Cook, McMillan and
the rest pure patriots, who are creating dis-
turbances in Parliament, fomenting agita-
tions throughout the country, and in general
doing their best to stir up strife and hatred
because they want to assist the EmpireV
Or are they simply battling to keep Parlia-
ment impotent, as a means of propping up
the privileges of York-street importers and
other middlemen V
“Schedule”: The annual agitation has
begun to make the temporary helps in the
Income Tax Department permanent orna-
ments of Ma’s public service. Although the
Public Service Act requires entrance by
examination, State Governments have three
times passed special legislation to allow
temporary clerks in the Taxation Depart-
ment to remain there without examination
or the other prescribed qualifications. Two
reasons are given: (1) The clerks have been
so long employed that it is ludicrous to call
them temporary; (2) they have learnt so
much about the business Standing of
various people that the Government simply
daren’t let them loose for fear they would
sell their knowledge. Both reasons are
bad. First, if the work for which the casual
hands were originally engaged was of a
permanent nature, then clerks who had:
qualified for employment under the Act
should have been taken on. Secondly, heavy
penalties are provided for those who dis-
close income-tax secrets; and if any person
in the temporary service is suspected of
being one who would illegally use liis
knowledge, the sooner he is put outside the
door the better. The amazing thing is that
the staff should apparently approve of the
argument that it should be kept on because
it is a notenfial blackmailer.

“The Father of Australian Federation.” Who’s he?
Why, George Reid! We have it on high episcopal
authority. Dr. Golding-Bird, Anglican Bishop of Kat-
goorlie, stated it as a historical fact to a big audi-
ence in the Albert Hall, and lie added the equally
accurate information that Reid’s name was -‘one
to conjure with among- all parties in Australia.” And
Yes-No, who played fast-and-loose with the great
question up to the very last moment, was ready to
P ass on to posterity the ridiculous imposture that he
is the “Father of Australian Federation.” He did not
make the slightest disclaimer or repudiation, but
rather signified his pleasure by back-scratching the
Bishop of Ivalgoorlie as “a man of real flesh and
blood, who is doing a great work for Christianity in
the vast interior of- Western Australia ’—the vast in-
terior that he had scarcely reached before he left it
to come cadging in London.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A favorite anti-Referenda argument of the
Liberals is that the submission of the ques-
tions during the war will disfranchise the
30,000 Australians who are fighting in the
Dardanelles. Yet twice, during the past few
days, the Liberal party in the Australian
Parliament has struck work, at the instance
of Joseph Cook, and marched from the Cham-
ber. It is a nice question whether it is more
reprehensible to disfranchise about 30,000
soldiers, or, roughly, 40 times as many ordi-
nary citizens.
ANOTHER WAR BABY.
Mr. Lloyd-George pointed out that any industry
could be brought under the Act by a proclamation.
Tfie Government was endeavoring to prevent the State
being robbed. In fact, they wanted to get a measure
of honest Socialism.— Cable.
Spain is the latest horrible example. It
hail to renew a mere matter of 30 millions
or- so, and pushed the p.n. along ; but Cohen
said he wanted his ducats, and as Don
lmpecuniosity hadn’t any ducats the bailiff
now sits on the doorstep, smelling horribly
of garlic and demanding cash. Cohen seems
painfully anxious lately to get hold of his
ducats, and if Australia —but then, of course,
there are our great natural resources and
all the rest of it. We're all ri°ht. Fill
’em up again !
The roof of the Federal Parliament has
been split in 15 places by Joe Cook’s
frenzied protestations that every patriot has
but a single duty, .every politician but one
obligation—to put his last ounce of energy,
his last bean, into the “common cause.”
“Nothing else matters,” he proclaims. “Let
us drop party and concentrate on considera-
tions of national safety.” Then Joseph as
principal agitator visits Sydney, and
addressing a meeting of Liberal women,
tells them that every patriot has two duties
—-to stem the tide of Socialism and to keep
the war going. Now, what foot is Joe
Cook standing on —the anti-Sosh foot, with
its corns and bunions and blisters, or the
patriotic foot? If Socialism doesn’t matter
in Melbourne, why does it matter so much
in Sydney?
The S.A. Register has done a cruel
thing. With all the Liberals howling that
our whole duty is to get men to the
trenches, it prints a list of “eligible fighters”
in the S. Aus. Parliament. Giving the age
of every member, it shows that there are
four in the Council and 16 in the Assembly
who are under 45. Not one of these has
gone to the Front, whereas of 670 members
of the English Commons no less than 1S6
had proceeded on active service prior to
March.
THEIR ONE FAILING.
Australians who were taken prisoners by the Turks
and escaped report that they were well treated. The
Turks’ method of fighting is generally fair. — Cable.
THE AUSTRALIAN: “Blime, you're not half
a bad old waster, Abdul; but you keep
rotten company."
It seems fairly clear now that the Harms-
worth attacks which shook up the British
Government and led to the new plan of
campaign in England originated at the head-
quarters in Flanders. Anyhow, they were
immediately preceded by a “protracted stay”
of Northcliffe at the Front as the “personal
guest” of Field-Marshal French, which visit
had itself followed upon the British Com-
mander-in-Chief’s chaperoning of two Ilarms-
worth war-correspondents—Repington, of
tlie Times, and Valentine Williams, of the
Daily Mail. From this it looks as though
French had wearied of applying through
official channels for men and munitions, and
as a last resort to awaken the British Gov-
ernment and the censor-ridden public had
admitted the influential Harmswortli papers
to his confidence, and allowed them to view
for themselves the tragedy that threatened
the British army if something was not done
at once.
Hughes might be passable as a Dictator,
but Andrew Fisher, the alleged revolution-
ary, has a fetich —and that is law and
order. So when the anti-Socialist Cook and
the discontented Anstey tell him the un-
truth that he already has powers to do the
things the Referenda will authorise, they
are only violent revolutionaries objecting to
a democratic Tory’s respect for the law.
Still the vain Opposition has proved some-
thing. By its collective exits from the
Reps., leaving the Government to pass the
measures without- opposition, they prove
that an Opposition is unnecessary, and
might find useful outlet for its bitterness by
going north and west to the Turks.
“Pat”: A citizen soldier was sacked by
his Brisbane employer while absent from
work on defence duty—garrison or bridge
guarding, or something like that. He was
evidently a capable workman, as his boss
gave him a testimonial to aid him in seem-
ing another job. The employer was sued
for wrongful dismissal, plaintiff relying on
the Defence Act. All the evidence pointed
to a certain win for the youth; but the
magistrate decided that “the Act protects
Citizen Forces while in training, not while
on active service.” If that verdict is not
a bloomer the framer of the Defence Act was
a German. Will the Government see that:
a higher authority pronounces on it?
The full measure of the unpreparedness
of Britain when war broke out is only now
being confessed. Under the rule of the
Kaiser’s personal friend —the Haldane who
spoke of Germany as “my spiritual home” —
Britain hadn’t sufficient guns and shells to-
put up a'six days’ fight against a . German
force of 100,000 men. When the little
expeditionary army had departed for France
with all the stuff it could get, the country
was practically helpless, and had Germany
risked an invasion whilst her fleet was tak-
ing its chance in a naval battle, there was
nothing to prevent a victorious march to
London. Germany knew a lot; but appar-
ently it didn’t know quite how helpless a
proposition England was in those degener-
ate days.
Victorian farmers who “conferred” at
Wangaratta last week got some information
about the maffra beet-sugar industry that
set them thinking. A local grower told
them that he had dubiously tried beets five
years ago. This year, after paying £lO
expenses on his 35 acres, he had netted £25
per acre —off land which had cost him £26
10s. per acre six years ago ! A Maffra bank
manager, obviously au fait with the finan-
cial side of the business, said that many of
the growers were doing so well that they
owned motor-cars. Further, there was no
labor problem involved,' as the same com-
petent men offered their services in abund-
ance year after year, at wages ranging from
10s. to 13s. per day. If it is half as good
as that, there looks to be here-an industry
that might become almost as valuable to
the country as butter-making. Yet it has so
far had a miserable existence. Why? At
present the onus lies uncomfortably close to
the Victorian newspapers, which have not
shown any inclination ,to boom anything
that might affect the monopoly that handles
cane sugar.
Waxelleney Madden, who lately assured
Melbourne in an unofficial way that the
war would be over in August, is now pro-
testing that he will “stick to liis optimism”
because he thinks optimism is
the Empire’s best policy. Ger-
many thinks so, too. In fact,
the same artful German ele-
ment in Britain which opposed
the strengthening of the Navy,
or any other scheme of national
defence, which blew cold
on Lord Roberts and cast ridi-
cule on Robert Blatchford, is
the element which manufac-
tured optimism and spread it
through the land. Prophets of
Madden’s kidney don’t stick to
optimism. Optimism sticks to
them. It’s the fly on their
patriotism, the blight on their judgment, the
molasses on their oratory.
A plaintive appeal, calling on Sydney to
rally round the flag of discontent, found a
corner in the newspapers the other day,
the object being to protest against George
Reid’s “recall” from London. What!
Spruce Smith’s “paralysed nation” to be
disturbed in the midst of war and loans
by the mythical grievances of George Reid !
He was sent away to a job for five years,
served his time, got 12 months’ extension,
was paid for that, and now comes home.
There is, then, no grievance. What do
these Liberals mean by intruding such a
matter upon us at this juncture!
There are all sorts of nice surprises in a
borrowing policy—especially in the policy of
borrowing from a foreign Cohen. The
other day South Melbourne thought it had
run the last risk; but it found another. It
owed £BO,OOO and had scraped up the money
to pay; then it found that Cohen, of Lon-
don, naturally wasn’t willing to come to
South Melbourne to take delivery of his
sovereigns, and that in the present upheaval
it would cost just £l2OO to get the £SO,OOO
to the other side. South Melbourne squirmed ;
but it had to pay.
THE IRON CROSSES HOLD AN INDIGNATION MEETING.
The Allies’ air-raid on Karlsruhe shocked the Kaiser and caused intense indignation throughout
Germany.— Cable.
Though Tom Seddon, the second son and
Parliamentary successor of Maoriland’s old
dictator, is off to the Front, the eldest boy,
Dick, is still at home; and as Dick is a
soldier-captain, trained in S’Africa and at
the Staff College at Camberley, gossip was
recently wagging 27 tongues. It appears,
however, that at I lie beginning of things
Dick wrote to the Defence Department
•offering his services to the country, and
received a reply that he would be informed
when tlie country wanted him. As it hasn’t
wanted him so far, people are beginning to
wonder whether any of the politicians now
handling affairs in the Dominion are small
enough to recollect a row over young Dick’s
resignation from the military forces a
couple of years back, because lie reckoned
lie wasn’t getting a fair deal, or any who
are sufficiently contemptible to stfll permit
the once bitterly-hated name of Seddon to
govern the situation.
Massey, of Maoriland, is talking about
“settling returned soldiers on the land.” _ But
he hasn’t explained the character of the
amendments he is going to make in the Land
Act. And he won’t. Returned soldiers
and stay-at-home toilers have as much chance
of getting on the soil of Maoriland, except
as junior partners of Cohen, as they have oi
catching mutton-birds on Ngauruhoe. And
that’s the beginning and end of 25 years’
“Liberal” fluting.
MOST ANNOYING.
JOHN BULL: “Confound that bird! How the
Devil can I read my war news in peace
while he’s dropping bombs about!"
In the N.S.W- Assembly the other day
Osborne, of Paddington, was pounding at
some unpatriotic people who, having control
of certain commodities, “have seized the op-
portunity to make money at whatever cost.'’
Holman chipped in : “The very soldiers’ food
is the subject of daily frauds.” This enraged
David Storey, the representative of Hand-
wick and York-street, and with a glare of
indignation he shouted: ‘7 1 is a disgrace io
our country that these pettifogging, paltry
ideas should be put forward /” Patriotism
in the mind of people like Storey appears to
consist of flag-whirling and the bawling of
Gorsave. Such matters as the proper util-
isation of the country’s food supplies and
the prevention of robbery and jobbery by
middlemen and contractors are paltry and
pettifogging things, only lit for a nation like
the Germans.
ON HIS OWN.
[Fon The Bulletin.]
Two master devils prayed at Satan’s knee:
“Let’s go to Belgium! There’s fine work to do!"
But Satan laughed : “The Kaiser’s there. Let be!
He’s doing Very well without you two.”
MAoriland. SELWYN RIDER.
Fitzpatrick last week elicited tlie informa-
tion in N.S.W. Assembly that the tines, total-
liuff' £4588, inflicted months ago on strikers
and officers of the Miners’ Federation, had
not been paid—that, as a matter of fact, no
portion had been paid. Meanwhile, the Law
is sleepily nosing round after another thistle,
and its trembling guardians wonder wl&t
they are going to do about this open defiance.
THE CHANGELING.
[Eon The Bulletin.]
War’s lightnings stabbed the sombre sky,
Its thunderbolts were earthward hurled ;
The smoke of battle mounted high
Beyond the boundaries of the world ;
And shrill above the din and fray
The frightened Tory had his say.
Forgetting all his ancient creed
He took a firm, unflinching stand,
And, mindful of the nation’s need,
“Conscription” was his first demand!
He’d called it “vile, un-British, wrong,”
But for it now he barracked strong.
When more munitions were required,
Sosli, which had shocked him to the soul
In other days, he straight desired,
And yelled like mad for State control.
The Tiger seemed the only thing
To save the Empire and its King!
The Hun remained unconquered yet;
One joss was left to kick, and so
Its worshippers, with features set,
Cried: “Party Government must go!”
It hurt, for they’d been wont to state
’Twas this had made the Empire great!
Still, be it clearly understood,
These changes are not meant to last.
The Tory where of old he stood
Will stand when Armageddon’s past.
Lloyd-George’s glory, too, will fade—•
Once more he’ll be “a d—d Jack Cade!”

Miss MURIEL STARR
The Great Money-Saving Remedy for
COUGHS, COLDS
and Throat Troubles
Costs 21- Makes One Pint.
GIVES QUICK RELIEF.
Miss MURIEL STARR, the gifted ac-
tress, who is attracting crowded houses at the
Criterion Theatre, Sydney, and who is regarded
by critics as one of the greatest living exponents
of emotional drama, recently had occasion to
combat a bad cold. Acting on the advice, of a
friend, she tried Hearns Essence. The result
was so gratifying that she was pleased to pen
the following letter of appreciation.
Criterion Theatre,
Sydney, June 4, 1915.
Hean’s Essence Proprietary.
Dear Sirs, —I was suffering with a bad
cold and someone suggested that I should
try your Essence. The effect was wonder-
ful, and I think no public speaker or singer
should he without it. —Vours truly,
.MURIEL STARR.
The recommendation of Miss Muriel Starr is endorsed by many stage celebrities, among the number
being Mr. GRAHAM MOFFAT, the celebrated producer of the Scottish plays, “Bunty Pulls
the Strings” and “A Scrape o’ the Pen” ; Ml'. ALLEN DOONE, the famous Irish Comedian and
Singer; Miss GLADYS MON CRIEFF, the sweet Singer from Queensland, who is leading lady
with J. C. Williamson's Opera Co. at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney; Miss IDA RARR. the
clever English singing Comedienne, who has taken Melbourne playgoers by storm at the Tivoli
Theatre; Miss IS ABELL D’ARMONP, leading lady of the Tivoli Follies; Miss -JEAN
CLYDE, the charming “Bunty” of “Bunty Pulls the Strings”; Ml*. ,ALEC HUNTER and
Miss MARGARET NOBLE, of the Graham Moffat Co. ; Mr. ROLAND FOSTER, the
eminent Singing Master, and very many others.

NOT A CURE-ALT.
BUT A GENERAL CORRECTIVE.
It lias never been claimed for Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Fills that they are a cure-all,
working miracles, and producing impossible
results. It lias rather been urged for this
remedy that they act as a preventive and
corrective of many ills caused by over-eat-
ing and drinking, thereby upsetting the
organs of digestion and nutrition. It is
through neglect and carelessness that many
serious complaints arise affecting the blood,
liver and kidneys. Dr. Morse's Indian Root
Pills aid in the digestion and assimilation
of the food in a natural way. They assist
nature to perform its functions —not like
some remedies, such as mineral oils, usurp-
ing the functions of the bile —but increase
the how of bile, which is the only lubricant
nature ever intended. To the millions of
people who are eating and drinking too
much of the good things of life, and who
find a little help is required to. assist nature
to carry its often too heavy burden. Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills are. invaluable.
These ujillions of people are continuing year
after year to use this remedy for just this
difficulty with perfect satisfaction, and many
who have allowed themselves to get in a
deplorable state pf health from the same
cause have taken these pills, with results
calling forth their everlasting gratitude and
praise. They are made to a formula of the
highest standard.” and from purely vegetable
ingredients of the finest quality, and may
he taken from infancy to old age. as occa-
sion may require, with the most gratifying
results.*

NOTIONS
Last week’s casualty lists knocked a few
top-notch athletic Australians out of the firing-line.
R J. A. Massie —wounded —is one of the Ala state s
best ' at ’ cricket, football, boxing and field games ;
V. 0. Brooke (Tas.) —missing—-was a rep. ill cross-
country championships at Sydney and Melbourne, and
dabbled in rowing, football and cricket; Fred Thomp-
son N S.ff.) —killed —was a liefty Rugby Union rep.
last year, and a splendid 13st. athlete; and J. -J.
Addison (Vic)—killed— was a top-notch tennis
doubles- player who ranked next to Norman Brookes.
The Turks plugged a good footballer when
R. W. Lambert was shot, lie was up with the best
of them in Wellington and Auckland, and the best of
those famous football communities are no slouches.
Another good Rug’byito killed in action about the
same time was A. E. Fraser, a Canterbury rep.
player. MX. also lost a fine cricketer in J. N. Wil-
liam,.. He was a member of Lord Hawke's team, and
settled in the Loanlv Isles at the conclusion of its
tour.
Ilope-Crisp, the English tennis-player
who threatened to make considerable splash upon the
world’s classic courts, is out as far as the racquet
is concerned. He was so badly liit at the terrible
battle of Hill 60 in Flanders that a leg had to be
amputated.
W. Brennan, killed in Turkey, was one
of the men with good billets who came forward with-
out looking at the next fellow when volunteers were
called for. With 27 years’ service in the Lands
Department he took on a private’s pay and job cheer-
fully. He was prominent in rowing, and acted as
coach for the Commercials (Brisbane’s premier club)
and for the University crew.

Talking of the Baker family, by the way,
Harald, the referee, came in for the usual hostile
demonstration on Saturday night. For some inex-
plicable reason the larrikin element among the
Stadium patronisers has always persisted in treating
Harald Baker as though he were an effeminate
Percy. Coming from wasters who would run for
miles from a fair-sized JohnTlop, and directed at a
champion swimmer, inter-State footballer, first-class
boxer, crack horseman, and, above all, soldier, it is
ludicrous. Young Baker takes these outbursts with
complete impassiveness. The cither night, however,
he was moved to mention casually that, though
married and the possessor of a family, he was leav-
ing at the end of the month, or thereabouts, for the
war. And he queried how many of his howling
critics were doing the same. In him the Stadium
got the strongest, straightest, and perhaps most effici-
ent referee the writer has seen.
II. M. Somer and R. E. Baker are organ-
ising a carnival to take place at the Agricultural
Ground on Saturday, July 24, to help Australia Day
funds. There will be glove contests and trials of
arms and horse-jumping nnd rough-riding, and
chariot races, a beauty show and the crowning of
the Queen of the Carnival—in fact, the show will
be nearly as good as the cause.
* * * *
The Maoriland section of the stop-the-
gamesT'crowd - was.'given the straight official tip the
other day—right from the stable, as it were. At
Christchurch, where the Rugby men are forming a
unit of the Citizens’ Defence Force, Major Murphy,
speaking of the value of sport as an aid to efficiency,
said that “neither he nor anyone connected with the
Defence Department wished to see football dropped.
It was a fact that trained footballers at the Dar-
danelles had often led the charge.’’ Now, will “A
Mere Girl,” “Disgusted” and the rest of them kindly
ring-off?
* * * * ■
The racing prophets came a cropper all
round in their attempts to pick the. winner of the
G. N. Hurdle. Victories of heavyweights in 1913 and
’14 had lulled them into forgetfulness of the
previous past. Fourteen times in the last 20 years
the winner has carried less than 10st., and one other
winner carried lOst. exactly. Four of them have
been let in at 9.st., the bottom weight. This year’s
hero, Rathfarnham, was on the 9st. 41b. mark, and
for a few days before tho race it was whispered that
the fine big novice from Ballarat might win easily if
he could jump well enough. lie did both. Three
of the 19 starters —Milkabah, Rathfarnham and Win-
garara—-made all the running, lengths ahead of the
nearest of the others. There never was anything in
the race save those three for 21 miles, after which
Lord Grey came along in Hot pursuit of Wingarara and
the dark horse, Milkabah being then in the drop-
ping back stage. At the finish Rathfarnham had a
lot of steam to spare, whilst Lord Grey got a neck
ahead of IVingarara, tho horse that Eric Connolly
had drawn in a Tatt.’s sweep, it was said. The time
(oniin. 451sec.) beat the previous record by 11.sec.,
and considering that the course was a bit sticky it
was wonderfully fast. Too fast for the old stagers,
apparently. Milkabah, who set the pace, is a 5-year-
old like the winner, and Lord Grey is listed as
“6 years or a.” Hurdlers keep going for years, but
they mostly dirimprove, rather than otherwise, after
their fifth or sixth birthday.
As for the three favorites—Clontaft, Wis-
consin and Admiral Grand—their collective name was
Mnd. Admiral Grand blundered at the first timber.
Wisconsin was tailed off last most of the time,
although a week previously he had beaten IVingarara
for pace over two miles on the flat. Clontaft, the
false favorite from the time weights were declared,
never showed in the first dozen. The running of Wis-
consin, anyhow, was 'much too bad to be true, and he
is bound to do better in the Doutta Galla Hurdle
Race next Saturday.
With the “doubles" wiped off his slate
Moses may be disposed to offer reasonable prices
about the Steeplechase chances. The heavyweights
—United Kingdom, Booligal, El Progresso, Balnsta
(if he starts), Tints and Guncap — all have
backers, for one good reason or other. The weight
(list. 71b.) may stop Guncap, but with respectable
burdens on his back the clever little battler lias
won two big steeplechases, and lie is never to be
despised. But all the nags aforementioned are older
than Ungala (lOst. 131b.). Tim Doolan, the well-
performed Maorilander, would look more dangerous
with lOst. 111b. up if he were a trifle bigger and a
year or two younger. The writer fancies Tim Doolan,
but thinks of Anachrion, in the Miller. stable, as
being a more likely good thing. Anachrion also is
on the lOst. 111b. mark. He is now only a five-
year-old, and has not been much knocked about.
This time last year lie promised to mature into a
top-notcher, and if he has made only ordinal} im-
provement he must have a good chance.
Had Wingarara won the G. N. Hurdle
people would have wanted to know why one-eyed
horses are disqualified from running at Caulfield it
they can do such big things at Flemington VVm-
garara was a two-eyed fellow when he won the G.JN.
in 1912 with 9st. 71b. He is now one of six that
have been twice placed in the annual event. the
Yeoman scored a first and a second in successive years.
Redleap scored two wins and one fall in three tues.
Buzzi had two wins in two successive years, carry-
ing less than lOst. each time. Lord Grey has been
second two years running. But Obi’s record is best
of all, for he scored two wins and one third out of
four tries. Punters evidently have better cause tor
backing previous form in jumping races than m the
Melbourne Cup. ■ „
“Tote Abstainer” : One of the most extra-
ordinary sights in these extraordinary times me t*
the eye on any “settling day” in one of the busiest
thoroughfares of Sydney—the portion of Pitt-street
between Market and Park streets. Crowds of bookmak-
ers line the already congested roadway on either side tor
hours together, and complacently transact their bith-
neth. utterly contemptuous of the rights of the citizen
or citizeness who also may have business in the
locality. The “bar-ones” are never moved on or
moved off: Solomons in all their glory, they array
the sidewalk just as long as they please. 1 wonder
if Premier Holman ever takes a walk down Put-
street ? If he should think of doing so I would like
him to select a day after a race-meeting, and then
conscientiously tell us whether he really prefers the
bookmaker to the tote.
Adelaide Tattersall’s Club is doing so well
that this year it took two days for its Cup meeting.
Both were horribly wet —Adelaide lias had a fortnight
of almost continuous rain—and the totalisator, always
an excellent barometer, registered only £22,000, as
against £16.000 last year for a single afternoon.
Tattersall’s Cup was won by the locally-owned Juan
Fernandez (Keily’s), paying £6 18s. The much-
better-fancied Devron was a bad second, and bis sup-
porters got the consolation of 26 bob for their
pound. The final race gave a £24 dividend in a field
of nine.
A neat coincidence in treble victories at a
race-meeting happened at Auckland (M.L.) the other
day. Admiral Soult in 1914 and Harbor Light in
1915 both fell in the Maiden Hurdles in their re-
spective years, and then finished up by winning the
Orakei Hurdles, Jumpers’ Flat and Campbell Hurdles.
The only thing that Harbor Light did to fracture the
coincidence was to fall in the Maiden Hurdles at
the third jump in the straight, while Admiral Soult,
in setting the main, fell at the second hurdle.

“Golden Tips”: It was at Randwiek ou
the Hat during the luncheon interval. I found a
quiet spot, and had just opened the bottle, when a
little old man shuffled up, glanced round suspiciously,
and, seeing no one else within hearing, sat down
right alongside, “Yes,” he whispered hoarsely, “Leg-
o'-Mutton’s a good ’orse, but a helephant couldn’t
carry that weight. Peter the Plumber ’d ’a’ been
’ome an’ dried if we’d ’ad a bit o’ rain las’ night,
but tlie course won’t suit ’im. They’ve made Susan
a ’ot fav’rit, but I don’t like ’er. Fav’rits never win
’ere. I got no time fer Harrabella neither. But
’ere’s the Duchess o’ Wagga—yer’ll get 20 ter 1
about ’er. She come second at Rose'ill Saterdee week,
an’ they tried ’er out on Wensdee with Bitter Beer.
They both ’ad 8-stun 4 up, an’ the mare won be two
lengths. I’ll ’ave a bob on ’er both ways. She's a
moral fer a place.” I started to agree, but he sprang
to his feet in alarm and rushed off in the direction
of the betting ring, only pausing to shout indig-
nantly: “Gor’struth! Can’t a bloke talk ter ’isself
without someone eaves-droppin’.” He was afraid I'd
spoil the market before he got his little bit on.
Follow tlie King? Right! The mail
brings the dreadful news that his colors flashed above
Jungle Cock in the Haymarket Biennial Stakes. If
they’d flashed a trifle more suddenly they’d have
brought him the prize to help meet the high cost of
living. Now let the wowser wowse and the groan or
Bro. Stiggins be uplifted.

Victor Trumper was a versatile sport.
He played football under Rugby Union and Aus-
tralian Rules in Sydney, and was a Ma State “rep.”
at both cricket and baseball; and in every branch
lie left a clean name.
“Third Man”: Trumper’s greatest per-
formance was with the 1902 Australian XI in Eng-
land, when in 53 innings (without a not-out) lie
made the record of 2570 runs. In that remarkable
tour he piled up 11 centuries, and not once failed to
score in an innings—a record never approached by
any other Australian cricketer. Altogether, in first-
class cricket, Trumper scored 40 centuries against
Australian State elevens, Maoriland, England and
South Africa.

“Pavilion” : Sydney Cricket Ground trustees
are at loggerheads with the N.S.W. Rugby League.
The trustees won’t let the first-grade teams have the
use of the players’ accommodation in the members’
pavilion, and relegate them to the smokers’ stand in
the grandstand enclosure, the alleged reason being
that the required space is reserved for cricketers.
This might have some force in summer, but it seems
fatuous to urge it out of the cricket season. Any-
way, the outlook for cricket, by reason of the war, is
of the gloomiest character. -An English team is out
of the question, inter-State teams are doubtful, and
club cricket will be anything but dazzling. The
Rugby League is taking its revenge by staging only
second- and third-grade matches on the Ground, so
that purchasers of members’ tickets from the Trust
are on a poor wicket.

Recent references to the personal appear-
ance of the late Lord Jersey recall a convivial gather-
ing at Annandale (Sydney) green, after a game in
which his then Excellency took part. Mick Conlon,
since dead, was one of the party, and nothing would
induce hint to address the Governor otherwise than as
“Your Elegancy!”
N. S. Wales bowlers are rolling up their
sleeves preparatory to collecting a sum worthy of
record on Australia Day. The Association has donated
£100, making the second donation of a like amount
from .this source. For the Patriotic Fund £1800
was collected, and this second effort is expected to
realise £2500.

Albert Lloyd argued tlie point freely and
effectively for four or five rounds with Fritz Holland
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, and then
firmly tied himself up into a parcel of dead meat.
Holland took delivery in the ninth. A short-arm jolt
to the chin, followed by a clean swinging right at the
same address, lifted Lloyd to the horizontal for the
maximum period of rest. As he shaped up the
heavily-driven glove was again on his jaw, and down
he went, more heavily this time, to limply rise at
eight, badly bleeding, with reeling 1 brain, shaking
knees and unbroken courage. “Ha-ha; hit him to
——, Fritz,” yelled a fat Yank through his fog-horn.
Holland is too good a sportsman to take advice of
that sort. He looked at the swaying figure in front
of him—a child could have knocked the enemy oyer
the ropes now —and, shaking his head, stood with
dropped hands looking pleadingly towards the police-
inspector and Lloyd’s seconds. Then in obedience to
a demonstration by the Law the towel fluttered over.
Lloyd, who is developing into splendid' proportions,
must either unloose himself or remain a third-rater.
Placed before a boxer like Holland his unfortunate
style means certain defeat every time.
Jimmy Clabby lias been getting himself
disliked in New York. Recently he and George Chip,
with “less conscience than a couple of burglars,” as
one newspaper put it, tried to deliver a fake-fight to
an audience. It was so palpable that in the seventh
round the referee warned them that brotherly love
could be overdone. This well-meant advice having
no influence with the men, the ring-master ordered
both of them out into the stilly night. According to
accounts of the 10-round fight between Clabby and
McCoy, at New York, which ended in a draw, the
former was a very unwilling receiver of what came
his way. So much was this the case that lie was
accused of doing more running than fighting'.
“ ’Arty”: Pat O’Keefe, middleweight
champion of England, who was spurned as a. shirker
by the Bishop of Bathurst the other day, is a corporal.
He has been one for about two months. What the
Bishop fails, apparently, to understand is that a
soldier can’t be made in a minute. Pat enlisted as
a private early in the war, and when the last London
mails left his lot were expecting to be sent to Flan-
ders in August. Meanwhile, according to London
Opinion, “O’Keefe’s colonel has issued a recruiting
poster inviting lovers of boxing to join his regiment
so that they may "be instructed in the noble art by
the champion.” Pat is a queer anomaly, by the way.
He is pure Irish in every respect barring his accent,
which is pure Cockney. When he was first in Aus-
tralia, as sparring partner to Tommy Burns, he had
never seen Ireland, though his ancestors on both sides
are understood to have been kings in Erin.
The League games in Melbourne went
this way: Melbourne, 85 v. Fitzroy, 73. Carlton
beat South Melbourne by 57 to 47. Collingwood
whipped Richmond by 80 to 43. St. Kilda did the
same to Geelong by 89—55.
The champion team of the Association—
North. Melbourne —continued its victorious career, this
time at Williamstown’s expense—53 to 29. Brunswick
downed Hawthorn by 77 to 34. Footscray outed
Northcote by 96 to 61. Ports collected a neat 100
to Brighton’s 53. P’ran walloped Essendon by 43
points to 36. ’Town, P’ran and Port are now dead
level for third place, and great will be the scuffle
as to which must go out. Odds are a trifle against
P’ran.

It was Jack Monday, tlie footballer, who.
in a life-and-death struggle, toppled over the cliffs
into the sea of Gallipoli with a Turk, giving the
latter his last and probably his first bath. Monday
was one time captain for Essendon (Association),
previous to which he wore the blue-and-white of
Geelong.
“Chinky”: By beating Eagloliawk
Rochester team seems to have put the seal on the
Bendigo premiership. Eaglehawk (beaten by Roches-
ter three times running) is second. Bendigo City and
Bendigo South have put up good fights, and Bendigo
South may -yet rattle tlie ruralites. When Rochester
played its first match in City t.oeball circles it was
the butt of much banter. At the opening game
against the ’Hawks barrackers shouted “Kick it, up
the furrow, Mick!” But they don't talk that way
now.
“Coot”: On a recent Saturday afternoon
two Yic. Association footballers, Gotz, captain of the
Ports, and Strownix, one of Essendon's followers,
received each a blow on the head shortly after the
match in which they were playing started, and each
played on without knowing that he was in the game.
At half-time Gotz asked who had won, and thus
aroused suspicion as to his condition. After the
spell both players regained their senses, and played
on some more.
The Port Adelaide football club lias at
length baulked at a fence. It didn’t come down;
still, the check was there. In other words, it played
South Adelaide a tie-game of 4 goals 8 behinds
each, on a muddy day when skill did not count
much. It was the first match Ports have failed to
win outright for two years, during which time they
have met incidentally the premier club of Melbourne
and a combined team of all the other clubs in
Adelaide.
In Sydney the Rugby League teams stand
thus wise: Balmain and Glebe, 14 points; South
Sydney, 11; Newtown, nine; Eastern Suburbs,
eight; Western Suburbs, four; Anuandale and North
Sydney two.
“Whistle”: After years of mediocrity,
Balmain footballers have hitched on to success. The
metamorphosis has been little short of wonderful. In
the pre-League days and for some time afterwards
the Magpies were a set of lusty-limbed, promiscuous
units; to-day they, as scientists, compare favorably
with the illustrious teams of South Sydney, Glebe,
Newtown and Eastern Suburbs. It is interesting to
note that, after a remarkably-successful career for some
years, Eastern Suburbs retrogression synchronises with
the advance of Balmain. Every dog has his tail, but
it hasn't always got a place in the sun.
The League game is making poor headway
in Maori land.. Last week the two senior matches
down for settlement at Wellington were won by
default. It will be a long day before the Maoriland-
ers divorce themselves from their old love. Which in
some respects is a pity. They’ve got all the football
talent which can make the amended game so clashing
and attractive.
Harry Hawker, the Australian, has settled
. the doubt as to whether seaplanes are capable of
looping tlie loop, lie performed the feat on a Sop-
wit h machine the other day. Hawker’s little plane is
one of the speediest, and is similar to a celebrated
“tabloid” model, on which a young man named
Pixton won an International Cup at Monaco last year.
* * * *
Alan Kippax, who has put together an
Australian record with three “whitewashings” in
Sydney baseball this season, is a youth barely out of
knickerbockers. Two years ago he was a phenomenon
in Sydney schools cricket, and last season headed the
batting averages of Waverley in Sydney grade cricket.
When pitching Kippax has an easy, concise style,
with a command of the ball which promises some-
thing unusual. He has arrived in nice time, as the
disqualification of pitcher Harold Franks (with the
rest of the Leichhardt club) has made a gap in the
Ma State team through which Victoria was likely to
poke its entire nine.
"Viking”: Be par. B. l/7/’15 concerning
Bananaland’s anxiety to wallop N.SAV. at sailing 18-
footers. Models were recently submitted, and the
design of Jack Whereat was accepted. Colin Clark
has disposed of Vanity, which competed last year,
and will probably have another craft built for the
event. George Solomon, an ex-\ T . S. Wales sailing
enthusiast, al-o Inis a boat under construction. It
will carry the hollow spars and sails and gear of
the Colonial, which was burnt. The old crew of
the Colonial will he in charge. From the keen in-
terest taken in preparations for the event it looks
as if Queensland will be a powerful proposition.
.Tames .T. Corbett is another of the Yanks
who have gone away making noises about Australia
through their noses. Call it a land of sports ! J.J.’s
visit was the coldest time he ever struck. Because
his gentle anecdotes about his youthful days and liis
historic stoushirg past failed to stir Australian audi-
ences to their vitals. Australia is no “sport.” It might
have been tremendously interested in seeing Corbett
kill his adversaries with his gloves; but because
it wasn’t tremendously interested in hearing a faded
old Pompadour serve it all up again with his month,
James J. turns it down as no-account.
One Cecilia Wright, described as “the
young Anglo-American sporting writer under engage-
ment to supply sporting stories for the United States
Press Association,” is touring Australia. She told a Syd-
ney interviewer that she had taken an interest in sport-
ing matters all her life and then nearly stunned him
by remarking that she didn’t know what Australia’s
national sports are. “I expected,” she burbled,
“something almost as characteristic as what I saw
at Honolulu and the Solomons” ! But what about
our bunyip-hunting and diving for shark-eggs? Surely
Sissy hasn’t missed them !
* *• * *
“Moana” : Re the late Blair Swannell.
In the historic scrap at Wellington in 1904 between
Maoriland and a British team the local plan of cam-
paign made full provision for Swannell, it being con-
sidered necessary to quell Ids' enthusiasm earlv in
the game. The job was handed to a famous forward.
When the game ended in Loan Land’s favor Swan-
nell, carrying a pair of lovely black eyes, walked
off the field with his “shadow.” The good-natured
■Welshman ventured the opinion that the game had been
“a bit rough.” “Bough!” retorted the Maorilander,
who was a beautiful piece of mutilation himself—-
“that’s nothing. You should see a, North v. South
Island match!” “And,” said Swannell, sadly, when
telling the yarn later on, “I always imagined I was
an expert at the all-in type of game.”
Something: in the way of a record was put
up by Cecil Way at Tarawera (M.L.) recently. In
11 days he hooked 225 trout on the fly, the top tally
for one day being 42, averaging 5-Jlb. There have
been some big catches in the northern lakes of M.L.
lately, but Way’s heads the bunch.

I AM A WOMAN who belongs to a prematurely
grey haired family. My father was grey be ore he
was 30, and two of my brothers as well as rny sister
became grey early in life. Before the age of 25 I
developed grey hairs, which became Quite embar-
rassing to me and also in business. I
LOST THREE GOOD POSITIONS for no other reason
than my fading hair. The greyness increased with
alarming rapidity, and at “8 I LOOKED LIKE A
WOMAN OF 45. One day I was seriously thinking
of liuyiug one of the many Grey Hair Restorers
that are extensively advertised, when I casually
mentioned the subject to an acquaintance—a scien-
dfaf
tific man, and, as I after-
wards learnt, a great
\ student of the Che-
mistry of the Hair
He strongly ad-
vised me to have
nothing what-
ever to do with
these concoc-
tions. He poin-
ted out that
SUCH PREPAR-
ATIONS EVENT-
UALLY RUINED
THE HAIR, and
in the meantime
rarely deceived
even the casual
observer. He sug-
gested that I try a
formula that he had
perfected after a con-
siderable time, which,
by a certain chemical
action on the pigmentary colouring cells restored
the hair to its normal colour. In replv to my en-
quiries. he assured me that the formula was not
only absolutely harmless, but would develoD A
STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL GROWTH OF HAIR. My
‘fiend wrote out his prescription, which I had made
up, and after carefully following the instructions for
a tew days, I was surprised and delighted to find mv
hair becoming richer and darker in tone. The re-
colouring process continued until after some few
weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I HAVE
SEEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES from friends
and also persons unknown to me, who came to hear
of this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found A REMEDY OF EXTRA-
ORDINARY MERIT, and which is quite harmless, I
have resolved to offer it for sale, as I am certain
from my own experience that it will prove an ines-
timable boon to any man or woman who finds grey
hair to be the same serious handicap it was to me.
It is a Guaranteed Genuine Preparation, and I

Grey Hair to Original, Natural Shade.

Harry Wliaite, die Sydney scenic artist,
has been commissioned to paint the scenery
for Steele Rudd’s new comedy-drama "Dun-
can McClure,” to be produced first at Too-
woomba, Steele Rudd’s headquarters.
“Yarra Ben”: The yarns concerning the
way Beechworth received sundry shows
(B. 24/6/’l5) cheered me up. I am con-
vinced that critical acumen regarding
theatrical and other entertainments is more
highly developed in Victoria than in any
other State in the Commonwealth. Wasn’t
it in Ballarat only a couple of years ago
that irate playgoers chased a crowd of mum-
mers out of the town with sticks and
stones? Would they do that sort of thing
in Sydney? Bless your heart, no! Sydney
is known as the best show-town in the
world, which being interpreted means they
swallow anything there. Why, here in
Melbourne we hissed a piece off the stage
as recently as three months ago. Didn't
Nat Goodwin give it as his opinion (when
he was safely back in America) that Mel-
bourne was "a good one-night stand” ? Good
enough! There are some Yankee shows
we wouldn’t stand that long if we knew as
much about them before we’d seen them
once as we do afterwards.
“G.J.11.”: I want to protest against
“Mujik’s” classification (B. 17/6/T5) of
Rip Van Winkle as a German. It is a
cruel reflection on the memory of the old
gentleman who aroused our pity in childish
legends and inspired Washington Irving’s
classic. The champion long-distance sleeper
was Dutch, as were all his neighbors in the
Kaatskill mountains at that time. The
fact that the women folk ruled the roost
in poor old Rip's family should be quite
sufficient to prove he wasn’t German.
“Royal” : I was in the east at the Royal,
Sydney, when Tommy Walker (now
Attorney-General of Westralia) produced
his blank-verse play. “Marmondelle, the
Moor." I played Count Calamo, a Knight
of Malta, and wore a splendid suit of chain
mail with an overmantle of white silk
embroidered with a red Maltese Cross. I
also had a similar cross on my helmet and
shield, and fancied I looked the thing. I
had a magnificent entrance in the first act
with martial music and a crowded stage.
But the entrance was entirely ruined by
two words from a galleryite. I had ad-
vanced in my most dignified manner to the
centre of the stage, when, at sight of my
Maltese Crosses, in correct imitation of the
Leichhardt tram-guards, the lad aloft yelled
out, “Fares, please!”
“Harrison O.” : More in boredom than in
anger I say a final word to “Private Boxer”
(B. 17/6/T5). In support of his conten-
tion that the Shaw-Bar rie method of giv-
ing stage directions and introducing the
characters in their printed plays leaves “the
plot, story and action in a "state of sus-
pended animation,” “Private Boxer” in-
stances the first act of “Major Barbara.”
in the middle of which four characters make
their appearance. Shaw describes the lot
in. 28 lines—seven lines per character —and
this. “Private Boxer” complains, takes his
mind off the action. How. in Heaven’s
name, does this variety of mind get on in
the theatre, where a play’s “action” is “in-
terrupted” several times an evening, for in-
tervals of a quarter of an hour or more,
while the scene-shifters are at work? But,
really, this talk of. stage directions inter-
fering with the reading of plays is so much
hot-air. “Half Hours,” Barrie’s latest vol-
ume (my narasrranh anent which it was
that started “P. 8.” on the warpath), is now
reviewed on the Red Page (17/6/’l5). and
the critic observes: “Shaw was the first to
make his stage directions interesting, to
make them, in fact, part of the action of
his dramas. Barrie proves a most apt nupil
in the art of illuminative stage direction.”
That’s it. G. 8.8. and Barrie make their
stage directions an essential part of a
play’s action, whereas those of Pinero
merely constitute an italicised excrescence.
.T. T. Grein, founder and president of the
London Independent Theatre, announces a
competition for playwrights. The London
Gaiety has given him a cheque for £lOO and
the use of the theatre for the production of
the prize play, and in return is to have the
option of purchasing, on the usual terms, the
world’s rights of any of the efforts sent in.
The thing wanted is an all-British comedy
containing at least three acts. Onlv British
subjects in the United Kingdom or the Over-
seas may compete. October 1 is the last
day for sending in MSS. They must be ad-
dressed to J. T. Grein. 10 Buckiugham-
street, London. Name of writer must not
appear on the play. That and his address
i mst be placed in a sealed envelope bearing
a motto. This envelope must be attached
to the manuscript, but it will not be opened
until the final award is made, so that every
play sent in will be judged on its merits
alone. The paltry feature about the busi-
ness is that a wretched reading fee of os. is
to accompany each play.
"The Arcadians,” one of Robert Court-
neidge's biggest successes in musical comedy
at London Shaftesbury, was just about to
be revived there when the last mail left.
Hope Ohartcris, the melodious singer from
Queensland in general and Charters Towers
in particular, is in the cast. There is to
he a similar revival at the Aldwych, where
"The Dairymaids” are to romp again. Rose
Edouin, who was singing and dancing to
the diggers of Ballarat and Bendigo in the
50's of last century, is in this revival.
EATEN BY ACTORS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a dark hack room in an old grey city,
A manager's room it used to be,
Up three dark flights from a passage gritty.
But the man who sat in it, ah, where is lief
There in tin; cobwebs and grime and dust,
Read his own epitaph: “Damn bad show.
Company blithered, credit bust.
Eaten by actors. Had to go.”

GREY
HAIR.
London’s Beauty Writers.
Weekly Selections from Noted Beauty Experts Writing for
the English Press. Simple and Effective Methods.
By QLGA AMSDELL, Special Correspondent, London. Eng.
Why Ha-veS&rey Hair?
Few people know that grey hair'is not a
necessary feature of v age—that it can he
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural cfUAr in a few days. It
is only necessary to got.Trom the chemist an
ounce of concentrate of tammalite and mix it
with four ounces of bay rum. Apply tins
simple lotion to the hair for a few nights with
a small sponge, and you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has given perfect satis-
faction for many generations to those in pos-
session of the secret.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
the skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is perfectly harm-
less, pleasant and immediately effective. All
you have to do is to drop a stymol tablet,
obtained from the chemist’s, in.a glass of hot
water, and, after the resulting effervescence
has subsided, dab the affected of Ihe
face freely with the liquid. When you dry the
face you will find that the blackheads come
right off on the towel, the large pores contract
and efface themselves and the greasiness is all
gone, leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool.
This treatment should be repeated a few times
at intervals of several days, in order to make
sure that the result shall be permanent.
The Magnetism of Beautiful Hair.
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
look-out for any harmless thing that will
increase the natural beauty of their hair. The
latest method is to use pure stallax as a sham-
poo. on account of the peculiarly glossy, fluffy
and wavy effect which it leaves. As stallax
lias never been used much for this purpose it
comes to the chemist only in Jib. sealed orig-
inal packages, enough for twenty-five or thirty
shampoos. A teaspoonful of the fragrant
stallax granules, dissolved in a cup of hot
water, is more than sufficient for each sham-
poo. It is very beneficial and stimulating to
the hair, apart from its beautifying effect.
Hoav to Remove a Bad Complexion.
Cosmetics can never really help a poor com-
plexion; often they are positively harmful.
The sensible, rational way is to actually re-
move the thin veil of stifling.- half-dead scarf-
skin from the face, and give 1 lie fresh, vigor-
ous and beautiful young skin underneath a
chance to show itself and to breath''.
This is best dons. in a very simple way, by
merely applying mercolised wax at night, like
cold cream, and washing it off in the morning,
tfood mercolised wax can lie obtained from
any well-stocked chemist. 11 absorbs the dis-
figuring cuticle gradually and harmlessly,
leaving a brilliant natural complexion. 01
course, this also takes with it all such facial
blemishes as red blotches, tan. moth patches,
sallowness, liver spots, pimples, etc. As- a
freckle remover and general complexion beau
t.iflor this old-fashioned remedy is u'lfeftuftlled.
The Powder Puff Passes.
Every normal woman is always interested in
any plan by which she can quickly enhance*
her beauty, provided the plan is perfectly safe
and simple. Ever since the discovery that
ordinary cleminite, such as any chemist can
supply, is an instantaneous and harmless beau
titter, there has been a growing demand for il
from smart women everywhere. They usually
get about an ounce and add just enough water
to dissolve it. A little of this perfectly harm
less lotion gives a beautiful complexion to any
face instantly. If renders face powder quite
unnecessary. Moreover, its use cannot be
detected. The skin is instantly beautified bui
appears perfectly natural under the closes)
scrutiny.
Falling Hair.
How often one hears the lament, “I have
tried everything on the market, and my hair
comes out in handfuls.” Kot so surprising
either when you come 1o think it over. Hair
tonics to be effective must be fresh, and there
is no earthly reason why every woman should
not make her own lotion at home. The finest
vegetable tonic obtainable is made by mixing
a packet of boranium with j-pint, of bay rum
and adding sufficient water to fill a half-pint
bottle. This lotion rubbed briskly into the
scalp sets the hair roots tingling with new
life, and will, if persevered with, give you back
your “crowning glory.” i-

This story concerns the spinster sisters of
n comparatively eminent person lost to his
country through a misfortune with a motor-
car some years back. The lone, elderly ladies
have started a moderately-select boarding-
house in a southern suburb, and last week an
acquaintance expressed surprise. “I never
thought you girls would come out of your
shells like this.” she said. “No,” replied
the elder sister. “It is a trial. But you
know, my dear, meat is so expensive one
cannot afford to keep cats, and one must
have some sort of company.”
Yenizelos, the great man whom Greece
lias declared for in opposition to the known
wishes of an apparently dying—and there-
fore trebly powerful—king, began as a
fisherman; was at different times a sheep-
farmer in a very small way, and the owner
of a nine-acre vineyard ; later became an
insurgent general and drove his present
king’s favorite brother out of Crete, and
to-day is a barrister. The King’s party
consists of himself, his brothers, his Ger-
man queen, and the military officers about
the Court, who are pro-German for various
reasons —amongst others, because they were
taught in a Prussian Academy. Yenizelos
has practically everybody else.
Though old E. 0. J. Stevens, the lately-
dead Maoriland Leg. Councillor, took a
keen interest in all athletic sports and was
a great crony of ,T. D. Ormond, owner of
the Karamu Stud, he was never known to
exhibit the slightest curiosity about horse-
racing. But his wife was a patron of the
trots, and for many years her carriage was
one of the features of the track at Adding-
ton, near Christchurch, the place where
they race for a trotting cup which is worth
more cash than the Maoriland Cup.
She was an invalid, and the stewards used
to have her brougham brought on to the
lawn and pulled up near the top of the
straight by the rails, whence she watched
the races. She had a most kindly nature,
and helped many poor trainers out of the
mire. But the old man never gave tuppence
to anyone all his long life except by
mistake.
Britain’s easy ability to finance the war
is ascribed by the best of authorities to “an
unflinching persistence,.in the steady repay-
ment of debt during ‘ times of peace.” A
similar persistence has been noticeable in
Australian finance—by its absence. The
policy of this country is to get heavily in
debt during days of peace, and then sniffle
round for a crumb or two from those who
have to find the cash to fight with.
A significant extract from the Paris
Debats was cabled to Australia the other
day. The big French paper reckoned that
there was no need for compulsory service in
Britain —that the volunteers were doing well
enough. But this doesn’t prove that com-
pulsory service isn’t needed. Nobody sug-
gests that volunteers, for tlieir numbers, are
not doing well enough. In fact, the whole
case for universal service is that the volun-
tary system takes the select few to the
Front to sow the seed, and -leaves the
slackers behind to reap the harvest.
George Archer-Shee lias been killed after
being twice wounded at Ypres and praised
for gallantry by his Colonel. He was the
central figure of one of those miniature
Dreyfus cases —mostly associated with school
expulsions—which convulse England every
now and then. Young Archer-Shee was
sacked. from the It.N. College at Osborne
on a charge of stealing os. He had the
luck to have for a father one of the most
combative old Tories in the House of Com-
mons. Major Archer-Shee, D. 5.0.. took the
affair to the Court of Appeal, which decided
that there was no evidence worth mention-
ing against the boy, and gave him £7150
damages. If it had been a housemaid who
was unjustly fired on a similar accusation,
instead of the son of a rich Englishman and
a Yankee heiress, the compensation would
probably have been about 12s. 6d. —but that
is the way of the Law. The Archer-Shees
are well-known English B.C.’s. and the
dead hero’s father has been one of the most
prominent Parliamentary critics of the cen-
sorship and of the laxity of Britain’s atti-
tude towards resident Huns.
“Mujik” reports the wil’-rabbi’ man :—-
“Yes; people show a singular lack of discrimina-
tion in purchasing foodstuffs,” he observed, as he
accepted a cigarette and leaned gracefully against
the conservatory door. “The conclusion is forced
upon one that educational movements and mothers’
meetings have failed to keep pace with modern re-
search in the field of dietetics. Of course we all
recognise that the training of women during the
plastic years of youth, in regard to the essential
things of life, is wholly empirical. Neglect of science
leaves a distinct hiatus in the equipment with which
they approach their responsibilities. Their know-
ledge of the nutritive values of food seems, ’pon my
sold, scarcely rudimentary. There are your neigh-
bors, the .Tiniblickjoneses and the Quecrsambleses,
both of them most estimable citizens, with industrious
wives who sew for our brave lads at the Front.
Well, Jimblick joiies, you will have noticed, is what
one might call stout, even fat; and I fear that
Madam is beginning to get a bit short in the wind
too. Now’, the Jimblickjoneses won't look at a rab-
bit. They cat pork—actually have pork chops for
breakfast. The w’orst thing in the world for 'em. But
the Queersamblescs over there —both of 'em. let us
say, skinny, each with a digestive tract requiring
stimulation—are always eating rabbit, and getting
more frail and dyspeptic every day. The nutritive
value of rabbit is about equal to that of shavings
fiorn blackbutt; and Queersambles, who wants to get
fat, goes ou stoking-up with Bunny, while Jim-
blickjones wastes money on Turkish baths to try and
get thin, and fills himself with the flesh of swine!
Vi's a queer world. Master. I notice that Professor
Anderson Stuart has been saying that if men were
fed better they wouldn’t seek solace at the shrine of
Yellow Head. Take it from me that a man full of
meat is pretty hard to hold ; but a man full of rab-
bit —w’ell the canary coiffure might as well go out
of business. I'm imparting this information in the
interests of a great public movement to- reach a
higher plane; for wo arc all patriots now, and, as
the Empire is at stake, if any serious proposal is
made to send rabbits to our gallant boys in Gallipoli.
1 shall address a public meeting.” Then Bill came in
after his mate, with gouts of Bunny’s blood on his
arms, and damned the rabbit back to the ancestor of
all its tribe. Do all men chafe at their collar and
want to try another? Do all wil’-rabbi’ specialists
pine for opportunity to make original research?
And do drapers hanker to bask in the sun as bottle-
ohs?

THE GIES REVERSE GEAR.
The GIES is built in three sizes of the enplosed and open type, so that it
is the best-fitted reverse gear for the greatest number of power boats. It is
the simplest reversing mechanism made. The few parts it has are all inter-
changeable, as they are jig made to accuracy. High-grade materials and first-
class workmanship, combined with right design, make the GIES the most depend-
able reversing device on the market.
GIES Gears are not an exper'ment, they are the result ot
1 ' ears’ experience in building reverse gears exclusively. Over
30,000 satisfied customers are our best recommendations.
LJ i ALEES: We wish to secur responsible dealers wherever
we have no representation. We feel certain that reliable
importers will want to represent the GIES line, once they have
investigated its merits. The GIES offers any dealer a com-
plete line of reverse gears to fit any make of engine. Rightly
priced and widely advertised, th • GIES will be a quick-selling,
money-making line to handle. Write for our special dealers’

IN
BANANA LAND
Queensland Government has just pro-
claimed an open season for the shooting of
opossums and native bears. But why in-
clude Norman Lindsay’s gentle koala? No
one can, by any legitimate use of language,
call him destructive.
“Quill” disagrees:—
What sort of “reform” is this of Hardacre’s—abol-
ishing home-work in schools ? I suppose he thinks it
will benefit somebody. I know it will damage some-
body—the frequent smart but lazy kid whose parents
are too casual to bother about the youngster’s exer-
cise-books or the formation of his character. Take
such subjects as arithmetic, English and geography.
Taught in large classes most of the youngsters are
merely confused or else learn like parrots. Let a boy
or girl from 10 years upwards have half an hour’s
direction from a parent in the evening, and with time
comes understanding. In this way an early love can
be created for literature —even, if the mind moves that
way, for mathematics. Within reason home-lessons
are a good thing—better far than the lesson in a
class, or running about the streets. The management
of them is the thing to tackle, perhaps; but that
would bring Hardacre up against the teachers and in-
spectors. Much easier to say abolish them. But they
won’t be abolished for the lad with a sensible father
or mother.
Pioneering work has been paid for in
recent Ministerial appointments, and as a
consequence the administrative business of
government will be carried on by an inferior
THE DAMNING EVIDENCE.
Any man who wanted to bathe after 10 o’clock on a Sunday morning was lazy, dirty and dissipated,
and the St. Kilda Council had no intention of catering for such a man. —Press item.

Ryan was a Liberal renegade or a Labor
convert or any other old thing; they saw
in him the brainiest and most capable man
on the Labor side, and welcomed him as
Premier. They saw other brainy and cap-
able men on the same side, too, and would
have welcomed them as administrators also;
but they did not get the chance. It was
party considerations first and to blazes with
the people ; and so the curse descended! And
no doubt it. will work as it has worked be-
fore, for there have been instances enough in
Australia of enthusiastic workers, unfitted
for the job by lack of early and continuous
mental training, being put to cope with
departmental work, ranging from mastery of
-minute and intricate detail to the brain-
racking duties of initiation and general
direction. That, however, is only a side-line.
The main trouble is that the people have to
suffer.
It sounds extraordinary, but is none the
less a fact, that in Queensland, where the
cost of meat is rising daily, no one had been
allowed, until a few days ago, to kill rab-
bits for sale. The theory was that if mar-
keting were allowed, rabbiters would en-

I say to warlike Italy:
’Tis true you’re false and faithless,
But cousin Franz can pay your bill —
Germania must be scatheless.
Bulgaria too may help herself
With yataghan or sabre
To flitches from my Ally’s side
Who is her southern neighbor;
I do regret the Sultan’s loss,
His outlook’s black and murky,
But if the Fatherland’s untouched
Who’d fuss about old Turkey?
Roumania, too, can take a slice
Of kindred Transylvania;
(Of course each nation has its price—
This grab’s become a mania.)
If Hungary bucks to hear of this
Her end will but be hastened ;
Her grief I bear with placid front,
So Deutschland be not chastened.
The Servian and the subtle Greek
May share Albania’s bacon,
She’s bound to drop in someone’s mav
So hapless and forsaken;
I’ll lend them each a carving knife
In case she be not tender,
But haughty Preussen not a foot
Teutonic shall surrender.
I know I must concede a bit
To this Entente Quadruple
And feel that I have shown myself
Considerate, kind and supple;
And if my partners sigh to lose
Their hills and fertile valleys,
’Twill comfort them to know ’tis still —
Old Deutschland fiber alles.
If peace must come, as come it must,
Why, “Give and Take’s” the basis;
It shows their dullness if my friends
Go pulling ugly faces ;
The foeman takes while Turkey gives,
And Austria, too, the tearful;
But William keeps his land secure
And bids them both be cheerful.
Postscriptum ( concessiones minores) :
If Gaul and Russia feel annoyed
And cry “One-sided bargain !”
I give them leave and license full
(To use a legal jargon)
To get to old Columbia quick
And glut their hunger sinful;
I know that Woodrow will not kick,
So they can get their skinful.
You’ll say it isn’t mine to give—
Your words are hot and jerky:
But neither was Franz Josef’s land,
Nor torn and tattered Turkey ;
I give what people don’t defend
When Rapine ravens frantic,
And so I make a present of
The country Transatlantic.
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 3, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The High Court is well represented in
the North just now. Chief Justice Griffith
is the guest of his daughter, Mrs. T. H.
Brown, at Merthyr, New Farm; and Justice
Powers, also, is here. The C.J. was at
Ascot this afternoon.
Talking about Ascot, the patriotic race-
meeting to-day was chiefly noticeable for
the absence of women.' Considering that the
hatpin sex goes regularly to the course it
would have, looked better if more of them
had put in an appearance this afternoon.
Mrs. Real and her daughter, Mrs. Phil For-
rest, Mrs. Lukin and her blossom, the A.
11. Whittinghams and a bevy of girl rela-
tions, Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, Mrs. Feez, Mrs.
Isaac Moore, Mrs. Earwaker, Mrs. Hooper,
the Eric Annings—the people who always
give a lift to every patriotic or charitable
cause—w r ere again the ones to hold the fort.
The frocking was mainly of the dark-blue-
coat-and-skirt order. Mrs. Gilbert Wilson,
in a tailored suit of rifle green, was an orna-
ment to the lawn, and Amy Castles was
another.
In the evening Miss Castles was wel-
comed at the Exhibition Hall, but the audi-
ence wasn’t large enough to make the
demonstration go far. Amy sang the Mad
Scene from “Hamlet,” the Octopus song
(“Aida”) and “Ave Maria.” It was a fine
volume of song that charmed the audience.
The singer wore a creation of oyster-white
charmeuse, with •& fish-tail train that was
all in one piece with the frock, and was lined
with black charmeuse. The corsage was of
jewelled net, and a line of black tulle, ter-
minated at both ends with a rosette, reached
from shoulder to half-way down the skirt.
(Home dressmakers, please don’t attempt
to copy.)
More weddings this week. Zaidee
McCord, daughter of the late W. F. McCord
(once M.L.A. for Burnett) and of Mrs.
McCord, of Coonambula station, was
married to Walter Kirk, of Hazleton. Mr.
W. E. Parry-Okeden, 1.5.0., handed over
the bride (she is his niece), and all the
sfluattocracy rallied round and wished the
V wly-weds joy and all that sort of thing.
The wedding was the big “turn” at St.
John’s Cathedral on Wednesday, and Canon
Pattinson has never performed better.
After the show healths were drunk at
Rowe’s. The bride made the most of a
white robe and a Limerick lace veil lent by
Mrs. Willie Persse. There were three brides-
maids, Misses Wade Brown, Challands and
Morey. Little Sheila Kirk was a desirable
maid-of-honor. One of the squatting Cul-
lens, Professor Michie, and Jock Kent
chaperoned the bridegroom.
On Thursday Percy Brier, our own
pianist, took the plunge, his accessory being
Miss Baynes. Three nice pink bridesmaids,
Misses Sneyd, Brier and Stark ; and Harold
Reeve and Norman Christeson saw fair play.
Another wedding was that of Doris
O’Reilly, daughter of the Charles O’Reillys,
to one Henderson, of Longreach, whose
parents dwell at Wellington (M.L.). Miss
Backhouse, of Tamworth, a cousin of the
bride, and Vera Macdonald were the brides-
maids. The holiday takes in Sydney and the
Land of the Moa.
Pretty Mrs. Encroe, a daughter of the
popular Mrs. Buchanan, quietly became Mrs.
(Dr.) Tom McKenna, this week.
The Mansions, one of Rockhampton’s
landmarks, which is on the- eve of transfor-
mation into a private hospital, was origin-
ally built with Mount Morgan gold for old
John Ferguson. The place has for many
years been the home of the P. F. McDonald
clan, until the Roman Catholics acquired
the fine old pile. Situated on the crest of
the Athelstane Range, it looks majestically
down on the town at its feet, and has
watched the evolution of Rockhampton from
a straggling hamlet into a busy centre.
Mabel Brady, daughter of Under-Sec. for
Works Brady, is on her way back to Eng-
land. She intends to join one of the military
hospitals, and do what she can for Mr.
Thomas Atkins when he comes home to recu-
perate.
Friday was Golliwog Day. Thousands of
these plain and useless articles were sold to
unprotesting citzens, .and the proceeds given
to the wounded soldiers’ fund. The same fund
benefited twice to-day, once from a fete at
Auchenflower, and again at the Ann-street
Presbyterian Church.
Bettie Cockburn and Lena Hammond, two
of our best singers, are earning the thanks
they deserve from Tommy Queensland. At
least once a week one or other of these girls
organises a first-class concert for the sol-
diers in camp at Enoggera or Alderley, and,
my dear, it would do you good to see how the
boys enjoy the entertainment.
The aeroplane fund got another lift on
Tuesday night, when a concert and entertain-
ment in its aid was held at the Centennial
Hall. Gladys Frost, Maibry Campbell and
Lena Hammond were in the front rank of
the performers.
The recently-imported Governor has been
desecrating hallowed traditions again. In a
speech at Charters Towers the other day he
remarked that he had brought three Banana-
land inventions under the notice of the
authorities with every prospect of success to
the inventors—one to accelerate the speed
of submarines, another to neutralise noxious
gases, and a third to revolutionise flying.
Continuing his recklessness, Goold-Adams
described the Atherton scrub lands in the
Far North as “undoubtedly a white man’s
country.” Then, before he could be in-
terned, he unloaded the suggestion that it
would be a good thing if some young Queens-
lander could devise a way of destroying
wire entanglements. When his Excellency
has been here a bit longer he will under-
stand that ideas like that must be imported
—the same as dredges, and toys, and music-
teachers and Governors and other articles
which the shiftless Australians haven’t
brains enough to produce for themselves.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Like every other Labor Minister who
ever took command of the Railways, Adam-
son talks of opening up State coal mines.
His idea is to have one in each of the three
great divisions of Queensland. Heaven
only knows why it shouldn’t be done;
though it is a more or less significant fact
that only in Maoriland and Victoria do
Government coal-mines supply Government
requirements, and Maoriland and Victoria
are the only two sections of Australasia
which have never had a Labor Government.
Unless Ryan or somebody gets a move on,
the. cynic will have plenty of reasons for
saying that the best way to get the Labor
platform carried out is to keep the' Labor
party in Opposition.

Every Advanced Feature
THE best and latest developments in
automobile design, construction
and equipment are supplied in the
Overland.
The body is modelled on beautiful
stream lines, without a break. The
tonneau is large. The springs are long
and usually flexible. The fenders are
crowned.
The Overland has the most advanced
electric lighting and starting system of the
two-unit type. Each unit is more efficient
than is a single unit performing two duties.
Ignition is by high-tension magneto
without batteries, independent of starting
and lighting. ~ ,
The instruments are most conveniently
placed in the cowl dash. The appointments
are complete, and of high quality. The
Overland is built in the Willys-Overland
factory- —the largest motor-car plant in the
world. Thus we know that every part is
made as perfectly as finest materials, most
expert workmanship and most efficient
machinery can make it.
Intending car purchasers are urged to
see the highly-developed Overland at the
local showrooms.

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
Thore are no teeth like those furnished by
Mature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teetli cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
inenectual. Hough powders, such as cuttle-
hsh, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE in scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
(thus preventing decay).
,EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube ever.v-

1500 foot pounds
at 500 yards
The striking energy equalling at
500 yards 1500 foot pounds is
one of the reasons of the ‘ ‘Ross
luck” which users of the .280
Ross Rifles boast of.
And the smashing blow
of the Ross copper-
tube expanding bullet
(patented) is irresistable.
Ross Rifles
If the quarry is fairly
hit, the spread of the
bullet in its body holds
the tremendous striking
velocity, and any animal
is felled; whereas the
ordinary small-bore bullet
goes through the flesh,
and quarry gets away to
suffer in the bush—the
hunter in the meantime
losing his trophy. Invest-
igate the Ross when
planning your next trip.

WORTHY of the beautiful Frenchwoman
after whom it is named, this Lavalli&re
shoe will appeal to all smart women
as being both fashionable and charming.
With its side fastening and ornament, its
short toe and very high heel, the shoe gives
a deliciously Parisian air to every foot, be-
sides accentuating the height of the instep.
The rich-toned brocade of its material and
the brilliance and exquisite design of its
ornament, gitfe the last touch of charm to
the present model.
There are various types of this, and many
another charming shoe in the latest shipment
of Bostock now arrived at the leading-
stores. The name Bostock is stamped on
the soles of every pair.

“scowbauker,” or “scowhauker” ? T.L.: Thanks.
J.T.H.: Have repeatedly urged it. .. .L.M.M.:
For a first attempt it is well put together, but the
gag is mouldy.... Llib: Such cases are not uncom-
mon, 18 months to about five years being the range.
... .Brad: A horse manipulated alternately by blacks
and whites was not “Zamia’s” point H.S.M.:
No space here for “resumes of European his-
tory.’ ....Northern Agent: We met a man this morn-
ing who said, “There was no sunrise to-day.” “How
do you know?” we asked. “Because I didn’t see it,”
he said. And that’s just your position concerning the
remounts Tasmanian: This paper said what it
meant that if ore opened up on only two sides is
1 egarded as too certain to be included as merely “pro-
bable” ore, then tile ore that is included as “pro-
bable ore must be a matter chiefly of guesswork.
There was no suggestion that “probable” ore must be
opened up on two sides. There was a suggestion that
ore which is “opened up’’ on only two sides should
be regarded as merely “probable” ore. Now, little
boy, run away and play, and don’t be impudent again.
....James C.: Can’t go into it again. Handcock
was charged with the murder of Hesse, the mission-
ary , Morant with having instigated and commanded
Handcock to commit the murder. Both were found
not guilty. The reports of the whole business are
here. They were a wild lot; and it was just because
they were a wild lot that they were put to do a wild
job in wild country. And that ought to have been
taken into account Delhi: The weight of testimony
is that the Turk is fighting like a Christian.,.,
Tjueei o: Most of the war news has come out of the
bottom of the trenches.... S.G.: This bombardment
of the enemy with words makes us tired.. . .Tiki:

true Maoris will be born then. Very few full-bloods
are coming into the world n0w.... The Aus-
tralian: All right; thanks... .O.J. (M.L.) : Ditto.
....Enquirer: Anyone who repeats rumors like that
deserves six months’ gaol. The Minister for Defence
married a Miss Barrett, of Perth Aucklander: See
B. 27/5/’15.., .C.E.H.: Nellie Stewart played “Cam-
ille” in Sydney Lyceum on February 18, 1905 (open-
mg date) J.C. (Brisbane): The guiding principle
of the War Pensions Act is that pensions will be
granted in all cases where dependency or partial
dependency on the killed soldier is proved. A wid-
o\\ed mother need not have been widowed for any
stipulated period to secure a pension. In fact, pen-
sions will be granted also in cases where there is a
father who is crippled or invalid and dependent on the
-on. .. . R.S.A.: The Courts attitude was reasonable
enough. Liability must stop somewhere. Otherwise
you would' have someone who had nearly been run
down by a train, or a motor-car, and who in conse-
quence had his nerves shaken, bringing an action
because the barmaid whom he met in the pub where
he went to buy a recuperative drink, turned out to be
a bad wife and an embezzler and a secret German.

Margery:
Gentle lady! Gentle lady! Don't you think it
would be wiser
To attend to Red Cross sewing, leaving men to cuss
the Kaiser?
....Beth: Beach verse doesn’t quite hit it... .S.
Dale: Pessimism not very well served D.D.
(Hobait) : No sheltered corners here for poems that

Is YOUR LIVER SLUGGISH?
The liver is usually to blame for the
feeling of lassitude and weariness many
people suffer from. A sickly bilious attack
comes on and the patient has relief for a
time. Pinkettes, the new vegetable laxative!,
are designed to arouse the sluggish liver and
correct the unpleasant symptoms. They are
effective without being harsh, and they have
none of the bad after effects of strong purga-
tives. Sold everywhere at Is. per bottle, or
from the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Aus-
tralasia, Ltd., Sydney.*
EATING What YOU WANT
Not to be limited in his diet, but to eat
whatever he pleases without discomfort, is
the dream of every dyspeptic.
Nobody can honestly promise to restore
any stomach to this happy condition, because
all people cannot eat the same things with
equally satisfactory results. It is literally
true that “what is one man’s food is an-
other man’s .poison.” P>ut it is possible- to
select a pleasing diet from articles of food
that cause no discomfort, and it is possible
to tone up the digestive organs.
When the stomach lacks tone there is
no quicker way to restore it than to build
up the blood. Good digestion without rich,
red blood is impossible, and Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills offer the best way to build up the
blood. They also have a direct action on
the nerves, and as the nerves control the pro-
cess of digestion, these pills are especially
good in stomach trouble attended with thin
blood and nervous dyspepsia.
You can begin this treatment at once,
because your own chemist sells Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. Perhaps you are not eating the
right foods. Sometimes the very things that,
people eat “for their health” are the things
that hurt them. A postal card request to
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, will
bring a free diet book. Write for it to-
day.*

Burned and Were Itchy. Could Tear
Face to Pieces. Used Cuti'cura
Soap and Ointment. Face Clear,
Boundary St., East, Little Coogee, Aust.
-—“For a long time I,suffered with black-
beads and pimples, pimples being my main
<JW aw* r
trouble. First of all my
face would burn then in a
few days it would all break
out in pimples which used
to be so itchy. Then the
pimples would come to a
white head. I used to feel
as if I could tear my face
to pieces. I took all kinds
of cooling medicines think-
ing that it was the blood and had some
ointment given to me by a friend but with-
out success.
I suffered like this for such a long time
until I saw an advertisement in the paper
for Cuticura and at once sent for Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment which I used
and found great relief and in about three
weeks my face was clear and I was com-
pletely cured thanks to the using of Cuti-
cu r a S oa p and Cuticura Ointment.”

PEBECO
Tooth Paste.
There are sermons in stones —
also in teeth. We’ll choose the
latter for our text.
But if everyone used Pebeco
Tooth Paste there would be no
further need of sermons, preach-
ments or parables on the proper
care of the teeth.
Pebeco Tooth Paste solves the
problem by ridding the mouth of
the enamel-destroying acids. “Acid
Mouth” is the dreaded thief which
experts now agree is the cause of
95% of all tooth decay. Pebecc
Tooth Paste arrests this acidity of
the mouth—even destroys the
acid-producing bacteria them-
selves.
You have not settled the
problem of your teeth by merely
keeping them white, clean and
polished. Pebeco Tooth Paste
will SAVE them.

“ J.11.R.”: Preserve us from the kind of
war correspondent “R.” (B. ,17/6/’l5)
would put in place of Bean. Those who
have worked beside him know that
he is not only a tine writer and maker of
word pictures—on the rare occasions that
they are wanted in a daily newspaper—
but he is also the best kind of reporter,
faithful, tireless, logical and shrewd. The
hardest newspaper job to tackle in
Sydney is a strike. The employers
talk too much and exaggerate; the em-
ployees fear the “capitalistic press” and
won’t talk at all. I first met Bean
during a wharf-lumpers’ strike, Sussex-
street was as full of police as of produce
agents; several carters had been mauled,
some carts upset, and a reporter had had
coal heaved at his head. Bean came down
with his big-framed pince-nez perched on
his nose, his spruce clothes and his detached
air. He might have been a superior per-
son Avho had lost his way while looking for
the Union Club. Ten minutes afterwards
he was through the ring of police, and in
the confidence of the pickets on the wharf.
Next day the Herald had the case for the
wharf-lumper as it had never been put be-
fore, and Bean with his university manner
and genial politeness had thenceforth the
monopoly of wharf-lumper information.
The reporters who disliked hitting coal with
their heads stood off and “visualised” the
strike, and “made images” about it; but
Bean got the facts. That is what he is
doing in Turkey; and it is probably be-
cause his stuff is so full of facts that the
censor is holding it back. ; The most com-
forting bit of news we’ve had is his state-
ment that he has investigated .several re-
ports of atrocities said to have been com-
mitted on Australian wounded-Hie would
do it as a lawyer—and had found them
untrue. The Turks were fighting fair. That
tallies with what Martin Donohoe told us
in Sydney last year: the Turk soldiers, he
said, were the best of ‘the Balkan bunch,
kindly and generous. “R.’s” “visualising”
correspondent would have passed the atro-
city stories along to Australian mothers and
wives.
* * * *
It won’t do anybody any harm now to
say that the “J.H.R.” of the foregoing was
,T. H. Ramsay, the very promising young
writer who died in Sydney: a day or two
after this generous appreciation of a rival
pressman was written. Had he lived,
Ramsay would have been much more than
a reporter, too. He was singularly versa-
tile: his range went from Abo. pars, to a
little first-class serious verse and a good
deal of excellent descriptive South Sea
stuff. In the Sydney daily paper grind the
Sun and Telegraph had his sendees;
but bad health had driven him off the track
for some months. He was still under 30
when the Sub-editor closed down.
Henry Bond Barnes, who died a few days
ago, aged 64, was one of Victoria’s oldest
newspaper owners. He handled the lever in
several towns, and was holding the Werribee
Banner aloft when Peter called for the last
revise.
* * * *
“E.N.M.”: Consider the S. M. Herald
how it grows. Day after day, the casualty
lists have been pouring in, and the Roll of
Honor in the ancient journal is assuming
discomforting proportions. All this means
much extra revenue; but it is only when
one looks down the long vista of time that
one commences to realise what the war really
means to “Mr. .Tames.” The “In Memoriam”
Roll of Honor, which will be commenced
about April 25, 1916, will bring the bright
sovereigns rolling in for the next 30 or 40
years. The slump in biz generally may
slightly affect the enormously wealthy
Hunter-street oracle, but where it loses on
the swings it is clearly going to gain on the
roundabouts.
THE READERLESS LEGION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They stand in rows upon my shelves,
The books I have not read ;
For up to now no time I’ve found.
But still, they’re rather nicely bound,
And even seem to spread
An influence about my den
That serves to speed a lagging pen.
At divers times I purchased them—
The Lord, perhaps, knows why !
Yet this untasted mental meal
Somehow contrives to make me feel
My Aim in Life is High,
And that I own a fearful lot
Of knowledge that I haven’t got.
The girls who sometimes grace my room
A weighty tome will touch,
And guilelessly express surprise
That one so young should be so wise,
And should have read so much !
They purr, while backs of books they scan,
“It’s nice to know a brainy man.”
I smile and blush, and strive to look
As modest as I can, -
But do not feel a fraud, for now
I have convinced myself somehow
That I’m a Well-Read Man ;
And thus have made a stepping-stone
Of unread books to Learning’s throne.
Still, there are volumes on my shelves
Whose aspect makes it plain
That constant usage they have seen,
And in my eager hands have been
Again and yet again.
They’ve furnished me with quite a store
Of most profound and varied lore.
Someone’s encyclopaedia,
A Greek mythology,
The charming book that Bartlett wrote
For writers who desire to quote,
A rhyming dietion’rV,
Thumbed like a Baptist’s book of hymns,
Smith’s “Synonyms and Antonyms”;
Roget’s Thesaurus, Whitaker,
A somewhat ancient Burke—
These are the volumes that I love.
But one I place the rest above —-
A most delightful work,
Of infinite variety—
The late N. Webster’s gift to me!
VICTORIA.

obstinate, and harder to treat. Dot in early. Always
keep a bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery in
the house, and take a dose at the first sign of a cold.

PUBLIC NOTICE
WUNDERLICH LIMITED.
Statements having been circulated to the effect that Wunderlich Limited is a
foreign Company, and that the Managing Directors, the Messrs. Wunderlich, are
Germans, or aliens, or foreigners, the Board of Directors declare that all such rumors
are absolutely false, and notify that a writ claiming £lOOO damages against a certain
firm, whose employees are alleged to have made such injurious statements, has already
been issued.

woman in London in the year 1815.
Notarially certified copies of Birth Certificates of the Messrs Wunderlich, of their

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HE blue smoke came up from the thatch,
I The white walls were hot in the sun,
The girl with her hand on the latch
Looked in where her grey mother spun.
Och, why would her eyes be so blue,
And her hair like the night with no moon,
And the small secret .thing that she knew
Go soft in her heart like a tune?
"The brown goat is tied to the stone.
And the milk is set warm in the dish ;
I'll be leaving you, mother, your loue
Till 1 bring you the two herring fish.
"The ass with the creels is below,
Coming up through the whins from the bay,
And Carty, the pedlar, I know
Will be walking from Innis this day."
The grey mother looked from her wheel,
Broke her thread at the half of the twirl:
"Go along with your fish from tin' creel —-
’Tis the pedlar that calls to you, girl.'
She has past by the thorn on the rise,
She has crost the brown path through the
whins —
Och. the thing that she saw with her. eyes
Where the wood on the hillside begins!
She had dreamt that she found it last night,
And, sure, ’twas the same in the day—
A ring of bright silver as white
As the scales on the fish in the bay.
Now who would be leaving it there
On the moss by the foot of a tree?
’Twas a thing for a young queen to wear
With her two idle hands on her knee.
Och, heart, would it fit on her hand.
On her smallest white finger of all?
Was it music came over the land?
Was she hearing the strange voices call?
The pedlar with ribbons and thread
Stayed long at the foot of the rise.
Och, girl, with black night on your head
He was sore for a sight of your eyes !
The ass with the creels was away
With the herring fish new from the net,
And the bare-footed childer at play
Made shouts till the red sun had set.
The night with small stars and no moon
Came up salt with the smell of the sea —
Och. heart, was it set to a tune
The wind that blew out of the tree?
The .grey mother sat in her shawl
With no word, but her look on the door —
Och, what was she dreaming at all
Of the girl that came back never more?
Was it patter of feet that came near?
Was it voices that talked in the thatch?
1 fid a girl laugh with never a fear
As we heard a small hand on the latch?
Och. put out sweet milk on the sill.
For the good folk will come to the door.
Think kind, close your eyes and keep still
If you hear a fine step on the floor.

The Happy Warrior.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I happenings mark the turning-
points in some men’s careers. In the
ease of Gunner Norton Hensford, of
the 41st Field Artillery Brigade, the change
dated from a kick by a horse.
Hensford had been rather an absurd figure
all his life. lie was an inefficient. In
the bank he held on to his ill-paid job, and
no more. There was no future for him in
the realms of high finance. lie was the
worst tennis-player in his suburb. Of a
gregarious disposition he failed, neverthe-
less, to forge ahead in a social sense. The
badinage of his age and class passed over
his head, leaving him with a bitter sensa-
tion of neglect. He felt that there was
no urgent demand for him at dances and
picnics; that he was endured rather than
liked. He would have given years of his
life for the debonair impudence of this
favored youth; for the skill and grace of
another; for the capacity to set a surfing-
party in a roar which was possessed by
someone else.
And then Maisie came into his life and
things got blacker than ever. It is a tragic
affair, at 25, to love and be spurned. The
unhappy Hensford was spurned, not once,
but several times; and to crown his misery
the girl whom he worshipped from the top
of her expensively-clad head to the soles of
her perfectly-shod feet gave her frivolous
heart to another—a large, cheerful ass with
immense biceps and a genius for cricket, a
chaffer of barmaids and waitresses, one
whom Hensford knew to be unworthy of a
pure girl’s innocent affection.
It was the morning after Hensford made
this discovery that he enlisted. He could
think of no better stroke to deliver at the
cricketer—a blustering craven who was
notoriously averse from the dangers and dis-
comforts of a soldier’s life. Besides which
lie longed for death. When they heard in
Strathfield that he had fallen, surrounded
by masses of dead, after defying the entire
Turkish army for hours ; when they read, in
the ignoble luxury of their homes, how the
General had cried when the untakable posi-
tion required to be rushed: “Send for Hens-
ford” ; when they learned of the cheerful
alacrity with which he had stepped for-
ward. saluted, and then turned, smiling
grimly, to face inevitable death —when these
occurrences were brought home to them, they
might perhaps understand and be sorry.
Maisie might change front derisive remarks
about bis habit of wearing a red silk hand-
kerchief in his evening-dress waistcoat to
an aching appreciation of what she had lost.
Her miserable admirer would be made to
feel something of the agony which the re-
jected suffer. It was in this frame of mind
that he began his training.
He was allotted to the Artillery, chiefly
because he was small and was erroneously
credited, as a result of-having been in a
bank, with education and intelligence. Bor
many weeks kis life was a hell. Insult was
his daily portion, and unimaginable discom-
forts abided with him by day. and night.
And then came the paltry accident which
changed his luck, or his temperament, or
both, and altered the whole course of his lire.
Ilis battery was at manoeuvres. The bal
tery commander cantered ahead, making a
frenzied semaphore of himself by means ot
his right arm. The section commanders
cantered among the guns shouting orders to
which the men did not attend, since their
eyes were glued on the lonely figure in
front, whose gestures they read as clearly
as though they had been verbal orders
howled into each of their individual ears.
The sergeants also rode about and shouted
superfluous commands in imitation of their
superiors. All was noise and tense excite-
ment, and in the midst of it the battery did
stolidly what it had been doing any day
during the preceding six weeks. The for-
mation was changing from “battery col-
umn'’ to “column of route” when the
wheeler opposite Hensford got a leg over the
trace. It is a simple operation, in such
eases, to undo the quick-release buckle and
refix the trace after it has fallen clear of
the horse’s leg. But Hensford naturally
bungled the job. He tried to lift the fright-
ened animal’s leg. It was then that he got
kicked.
His head ached when he came to,, but the
shocked seemed to have stimulated him. For
tlie rest of the afternoon he dashed on and
oif the limber with such briskness, and
carried out his duties on the gun with such
precision that his sergeant, a bitter enemy
under ordinary circumstances, said smil-
ingly at last: “We’ll have to see about get-
ting that nut of yours kicked every day. It
seems to be what’s wanted to make a sol-
dier of you.”
He noticed the turn in his luck as early as
the next morning. For weeks his tent and
environs had been an eyesore to the bri-
gade-orderly. Dust, empty jam-tins, scraps
of paper and other refuse habitually gar-
nished its approaches. The “lines” had just
been cleaned up when the Colonel came
round on one of his infrequent visits of in-
spection. Hensford heard the music of his
blasphemy from afar. He quailed. And
then came the dreaded words: “Whose is
this tent?” The adjutant’s cutting-whip
pushed the flap aside, and he stumbled out
and stood apprehensively to attention. “The
only decently-kept tent in the battery,” said
the Colonel infuriatedly. “That’s all. (let
back.” And he was gone, leaving Hensford
almost swooning with gratification.
From now onwards the erstwhile fool of
the regiment went ahead rapidly. He ceased
to regard the horse as a beast of prey. He
found himself doing things with notorious
outlaws which caused seasoned horse-mas-
ters to pause and admire. There was the
case, for example, of the chestnut with the
four white feet —an animal so undisciplined
that it had to be isolated from its fellows
and lashed to a tree by a stout halter, with
a bag for a collar. On the day the chestmjt
bit about a square foot out of Driver Smith's
tunic, just missing the removal of a piece of
his shoulder, it was Gunner Hensford who
smote the offender upon the nose, and, later,
by resolute handling, reduced jf to a state of
almost abject docility. The horse had every
desirable point but manners, and with Hens-
ford even its manners became good. The
Colonel, watching him ride the outcast after
it had removed one of the instructors, re-
marked to the Major: “We’ll have to make
Gunner Hensford a sergeant yet, if only to
get someone to use that horse.”
And indeed", before the brigade left for
Egypt, he was a sergeant.
The route-march was a proud occasion for
him—tlie proudest of his life. He saw
Maisie twice; once on the balcony of her
mother’s club, and again among the crowd in
George-street, where she must have hurried
as soon as his sub-section had passed. With
her, on each occasion, was the cricketing
ass. Hensford was pleased to note that the
latter looked awkward, self-conscious, almost
miserable; as well a civilian of his age and
inches might on such an occasion. The
newly-gazetted sergeant bestrode the now
completely-quelled chestnut; and he felt that
they did each other credit. The crowd
approved of him and his men and their
gleaming, evil-looking gun, and showed it by
cheers and shouts of encouragement. For
the first time the dream of a lifetime seemed
to be coming true. He was something much
more inspiring than a mere athlete or draw-
ing-room wag; he was a soldier and a man.
A note arrived from Maisie a day or so
later, asking if he would like the family to
visit him at the camp before the regiment
sailed. There was a time when his heart
would have sung at the sight of those few
scrawled and studiously casual sentences;
when every resolution would straightway
have died within him. But he was stronger
now. He waited 24 hours, and then wrote
briefly that the work was so strenuous in
those closing days that it was impossible to
entertain visitors. Might he look in on them
one day when he was next in Sydney, on
leave? It was a masterpiece of indifference,
and the one thing likely to galvanise a girl
of Maisie's type into lively interest, if not
affection. He had the courage to leave in
the end without seeing her, though it cost
him a good deal of delicious anguish to do it.
* *■ * *
The story of his great feat at Aka Hel
was public property within a few days of its
performance; or anyhow he liked, after-
wards, to think so. His battery had gone
into action at daybreak, and for a mad, deaf-
ening hour had been pounding the Turkish
trenches on an adjoining plateau by
direct fire. The Allied infantry hurled them-
selves on what should have been the shat-
tered remains of the position only to find
that the fire had not been sufficiently heavy,
or that it had been ill-directed, or that there
was not enough of it. The men surged for-
ward with the fury of tigers; they drifted
back again and again like dry leaves before
a gale. And always the invisible batteries
of the enemy searched for Ilensford’s guns,
yet by some miracle failed to quite find them.
He had known it must come for what
seemed like aeons. A shell screamed over-
head ; there was an earth-shattering explo-
sion behind him; he did not need to turn
his stricken face to realise that one of the
ammunition waggons had gone. And then
began a slow process of extermination, in the
course of which he saw his officer killed, his
No. 4 sniped as he was loading, and two
other members of the gun-crew put out of
action by ope shell-burst." Then poor little
Duggan, who was at the limber, suddenly

BACKACHE AND KIDNEY TROUBLE
Two Sydney People Cured.
Mrs. Chas. Clift, 3S Wellington Street, Water-
loo, Sydney, says-“In common with many others,
I have nothing but good to say of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. This remedy cured me of a bad
attack of kidney trouble of long standing some: six
months ago, and I have had no return since. Before
I took these pills I was suffering a lot with my
back, the pain at times being almost unbearable. 1
could not stoop or move freely, and al ways felt tired
and had no energy. The secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment, and 1
had dropsical swellings on my legs and ankles.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were one day brought
under my notice, and I sent for a bottle. They
gave me relief almost at once, so I persevered
with the remedy until I was quite cured, using in
all four bottles. I cannot speak too highly of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and recommend
them with every confidence to other sufferers.”
Mrs. A. Higgins, 17 Terry Street, Surry Hills,
Sydney, says:—“My husband suffered from urinary
trouble and backache for some time. The secre-
tions were seriously disordered, being thick and
cloudy, and difficult to pass. Ilis back was always
aching, and made every movement a torture. Some-
times he would scream out, the pain was so severe.
He tried all sorts of remedies, but all to no purpose.
He was advised to use Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills by a man who had been cured of serious
trouble by this remedy. He sent off for some,
and after taking two bottles felt so much better
that he went on with them. Six bottles cured him.
He has no backache now, and the secretions are
clear and regular. In fact, he is a different man
in health and spirits, thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills.”
Five years later Mrs. Higgins says:—“l am
pleased to be able to state my husband has been
perfectly well ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cured him five years ago.”

broke into peals of laughter, and dropped
the shell which he was holding, and ran out
from behind the shield, and as he choked
and fell, clawing the dust, Norton Hens-
ford knew that he was alone.
Simultaneously he knew that the line was
falling back everywhere, and that out of the
trenches on the hill opposite masses of men
were pouring into the valley at his feet.
He did not so much as consider the ques-
tion of running away. His brain seemed
suddenly to turn to ice, and his strength to
become as that of ten. In the limber beside
him and on the ground were nine shells.
He had, say, 12 minutes in which to fire
them into the close formations which were
streaming towards him. His first shot fell
at the very edge of the oncoming wave, and
the devastation wdiich it wreaked amazed
even him. The ejector had hardly done its
work before he had rammed home a fresh
shell and was traversing the gun on to an-
other part of the stumbling, rushing line,
lie could do nothing wrong. For seconds
after the percussion the hillside seemed to
rain Turks, and blood, and rifles. A missile
which felt like a paving-stone hit his right
shoulder. It did not prevent him from won-
dering whimsically whether he could possibly
get one of the aeroplaning Turkish corpses
as it were on the wing with his next dis-
charge. The valley narrowed at its bed. He
waited coolly till there was a press of men
in the spot on which lie had trained the gun,
and when lie fired the place became a kick-
ing. screaming shambles. He was hit
again at this stage, and again. He
told himself, now’, that the end was very
near—one more shot perhaps, and then to
deal with the gun, and meet Death as a man
should. But on his way to the limber he
decided that the shot was not worth the risk.
He could see the sweat-streaked mahogany-
colored faces breaking up the hill through
the low scrub, could hear their wild cries to
Allah. Flinging himself on the gun he tore
at the axe, his one idea being to put the
W’eapon which had achieved such fine work
for Australia beyond the possibility of doing
any good for its captors. Shouts and curses
and shots came seemingly from everywhere.
With a last despairing effort he drove full at
the buffer-case.
* * * #
He lay for a long time, after lie came to,
listening drowsily, without speech or move-
ment, to_ the beat of a steamer’s screw and
the lapping of w’aves outside the open port-
hole. Later a great surgeon—one whom he
knew well by sight and fame—came and sat
beside him, and said that with luck and the
devoted nursing which he would get in Eng-
land, he might recover. - Before leaving, the
doctor put a large, firm hand on Ilensford’s
aching head and said kindly: “You must get
well, my boy. The country can’t afford to
lose your sort.”
An -insane impulse came to the invalid to
answer: “They don’t think that in Strath-
field, Sir,” but he controlled it.
In the slow days that followed he pieced
together what had happened. He had saved
his battery. lieinforcements came up, it
seemed, as lie was dismantling the gun. The
enemy fled, routed. He had been given a
commission on the field, and recommended
tor the V.O. A French General who had
witnessed his act had taken the Cross of
the Legion from his own breast and pinned
it on him as lie was carried past. A famous
man had written of him: “He won not one
Cross but ten.” In the sum, he had only to
remain alive to taste the fame which the
world reserves for its supermen. And he
knew in his heart that he would live.
He had been in London for nearly a
month before he saw Maisie. He learned
from a paragraph in one of the innumerable
papers which wrote of his heroism that she
was there; and from the first day that the
admiring relations of one of his Territorial
friends came to take him out motoring he
had searched the streets for her face. It
sprang at him from the crowd one morning
as the car was turning into the park. Her
eyes held him for a fraction of a second, and
even in that brief space he could see that
they had changed. No woman had ever
looked at him with quite that regard before.
The letter, in the dear, sprawling hand-writ-
ing, which was brought up with his break-
fast tray next morning, came somehow as a
matter of course. It ran:—
Norton dear—l can’t help writing to you, though
you have forgotten all about me. Dear, I am
longing to see you again and to say how brave and
perfectly splendid we all think you are. I under-
stood how much you were to me ait or you had gone.
There is no one in the world I care for so—if you
still care for me.- — Maisie.
P.S.—Can I come and see you after lunch ? Send
an express messenger boy to say.—M.
Outside the sun shone softly on the dazz-
ling green oak-trees whose young leaves
almost brushed the hospital walls. Pinks
and pelargoniums blazed in the window
boxes, and from the square below came the
heavy smell of lilac and verbena. The roar of
London’s traffic was modified by distance to
a faint, musical hum, and suddenly there
rose above it the music of an old waltz —
an air which had spelt misery to him in the
days when Maisie had confined all her danc-
ing to his rival. The door opened with a
rush, as he had known it would, and framed
the most distracting little face and figure in
the world. “Oh dear, dear!” she cried,
and ran towards him with her arms out-
stretched-
* * * *
And so, in Blayre Asylum, the man wdio
had been Gunner Norton Hensford, and who
but for a chance horse-accident would have
gone away with the 41st Field Artillery Bri-
gade months before, dreamed and dreamed ;
and, incidentally, was happier than he had
ever been in his muddled and futile life.

A Frugal Husbandman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PHIL FLYNN sat outside a half
tumbler of neat whisky, regarding it
with an air of marked benevolence.
“There’s Martin Donovan,” said he, “a
savin’ man, ’n’ wan frugal wid dthrink, had
a glass coated wid silver f make a shmall
portion iv whisky look the size iv a lake no
less. Wid the aid iv it yeh might get
dthrunk on a thimble iv shpirit, supposin’
you was never the impatient dthrinkcr ye
are.
T\f x- t-w
The same Martin Donovan was wan
cautious ’n’ sparin’ in iv’ry mor-rtal thing,
It was his fir-rm conviction that wid jue
economy anny man wud die rich did he live
long enough. Martin held the far-rm round
the neck iv the hill b’yaut, the sort iv a
fai'-rm wud inspire the Prodigal Son wid
the savin’ grace, the sile bein’ that poor ye’d
uade t’ sit by it day ’n’ night, ’n’ sing shwe'et
songs t’ coax a poor turnip up.

Donovan is forced t’ hire a man wanst in
a way, ’n’ whin Dave Murphy axed fer a
job he was tuck on wid twinty shillin’ a
wake, his bit food, ’n’ a shake-down wid the
hens in a sbty next the bar-rn. Dave
Murphy is a nate, sthrappin’, clane lad, wid
a blue eye lookin’ quare in the brown face
iv him, ’n’ a rare thrick iv slimilin’ that
caught the hear-rt iv Annie Donovan widin
wan wake frim date.
“Dave finds a job iv wor-rk wid Martin
Donovan conthrary to his likin’, mainly be
reason iv a curious delusion iv Donovan’s
that ’tis custom’ry ’n’ proper fer tlie far-rm
hand t’ nade little of shleepin’ ’n’ less of
aytin’, ’n’ t’ wor-rk wid the patient enjur-
ance iv a shteam roller ’twixt the round iv
tlie clock. ‘An industlirions man will see
the sun rise,’ sez he. ‘Yes,’ sez Dave
Murphy-—fer Davie was a bould b’v, V wan
ready wid the wor-rd—‘ye’d have ‘your man
see it rise hefure goin’ t’ bed ’n’ afther get-
tin’ up ever,’ sez he. But Murphv is stayin’
wid Donovan agin his principles ’n’ ’liis
inclinations fer the love iv Annie.
I dunno it Donovan have an mklm iv
what’s doin’, but ’tis not long afure he’s
coinin’ to Dave, ’n’ sez he: ‘Times is bad,
’n’ me hor-rse have the sickness, V if I'm
not greatly mislitook the dtliroiiglit will be
on us this side Chrismiss ’r tlie wan afther.
Ye’ll have sivinteen ’n’ six a wake ’n’ no
more fer the future, David Murphy,’ he sez.
‘ ’n’ fer all that ye’ll kindly be sliparin’ wid
the breakfast bacon, will yeh?’
“Dave tuck the reiuced pay, ’n’ shtayed
wid Donovan, ’n’ eventual his wages is
fifteen shillin’ a wake. ‘Call ut three
pounds a month,’ sez Donovan, ‘ ’n’ ye’ll
not be thinkin’ ut slimall ayther wid bread
the price iv rare di’monds V mate risin’,
’n’ risin’, ’n’ risin’.’ ‘Yes,’ sez Murphy,
‘risin’ so high ’t has bin clane out iv sight
frim here these two wakes.’
“Though ’tis a shmall ’n’ convanyiut sum
t’ handle. Donovan don’t pay Murphy
reg’lar. There’s manny a payday missin’.
Thin Dave goes into Donovan wan Sundee
mornin’, ’n’, sez he: ‘l’d be glad would yell
pay me,’ sez he. ‘ ’Tis oncanvanyint, sez
he, ‘fer a man, ’n’ wan married at that, t
be deprived iv his earnin’s the way yer
doin’.’
“‘Wan married?’ sez Donovan. ‘l’d no
notion of ut. ’Tis oudacious in one iv your
class,’ sez he, ‘t’ make yer imployer
responsible fer yer youthful indiscretion wid
the urgency iv your .claim,’ he sez. ‘Divil
a sthroke would yell have had frim meself
did I know ut,’ sez he.
“ ’Tis. a racent act iv thoughtlessness ’n’
folly,’ sez Dave; ‘I wed quiet wid yer Annie
two months is gone Chewsdee.’
“ ‘Me gir-rl!’ cries Donovan, ‘me dauther
wed wid the like iv a poor, poverty-struck
far-rm hand wid a mis’rable pay ye’d t’row
to a cat. Ilell t’ yer soul, will yeh lave me
sight the pair iv yeh ! Off me land!’
“Donovan pulls himself up hard ’n’
shwallys his mortification wid a visible effort.
Then he makes a calculation wid a shtub iv
pencil. ‘Slitay, Murahv.’ sez he in a ca’m
voice. ‘Don’t be lavin’ in anger,’ he sez.
‘Shtop a whoile, V maybe I’ll have the money
for yeh this day wake, T in a fortnit surely.’
“Dave Murphy shtayed, not wan wake, but
t’ree ’n’ four, ’n’ there’s nothin’ iv pay
offerin’, so in he goes t’ his father-in-law
agin, ’n’, sez he : ‘I nade me money,’ he sez.
“ ‘’N’ whot money wild that be?’ sez
Donovan wid mild surprise.
“ ‘ ’Tis the money yer owin’ me fer me
wor-rk ’n’ labor,’ sez Dave. ‘Aight wakes et
fifteen shillin’ the wake —a mather iv six
pounds.’
“‘Divil a cint is owin’ yeh frim meself at
all, David Murphy,’ sez Donovan, ‘not wan
copper ha’penny,’ sez he. ‘Twilve wakes fer
me dauther’s boar-rd ’n’ lodgin’ et tin shil-
lin’ the wake is a mather iv six pounds, I’m
thinkin’, ’n’ that ye’ll pay fer yer wife like
a honest man, ’r b<? prosecute fer false nre-
tences.’
“Iv course Dave was frown into a great
tormiiit iv anger ’n’ was fer tearin’ the head
frim Donovan, on’y the weernin wud have
no killin’ T manslauther. ‘ ’N’ fer why.’
sez Davie, shformin’ loud ’n’ high, ‘did yeh
not pay me me money four wakes since,
whin I told yeh iv me inarryin’ ’n’ let me
go frim here wid me wife?’
“ ‘Fer me own reasons good ’n’ sufficient,’
sez Donovan.
“‘Fer whoi?’ thunders Murphy. ‘Tell me
fer whoi, ’r I’ll hit a hole in yer head wid
the praty pan I have in me hand,’ sez he.
“ ‘D’yeh think me an ould fool ’n’ im-
provident?’ sez Donovan. ‘Would I be
sendin yeh frim me dure four wakes since,’
he sez, ‘whin you was owin’ me four pounds
fer me dauther’s boar-rd, ’n’ on’y t’ree
pounds jue to yersilf fer the wages? ’Tis
not raysonable nor likely. Didn’t I lave
yeh shtay on f work off the d’ficiency?
But, Lor-rd iv Ileavin! Confused wid me
rightyis anger I come near robbin’ meself iv
twinty shillin’, ’n’ in me old age, too.’
“Donovan shtuck to his point, ’n’ he
showed Dave and Annie the dure that day.
Donovan’s dead ’n’ happy in Paradise these
times.”

IT IS REALLY NECESSARY
for everybody to undergo a periodical cleansing of the bodily
system in order that all impurities may be eliminated and
sluggish organs assisted to perform their work in a satisfactory
manner. As a remedy with gently aperient and tonic properties,
Beecham’s Pills are unequalled for this purpose. There is
no remedy “just as good” and certainly nothing better
TO TAKE
than this old and well-tried medicine which is wholly free from,
any harmful drug, and prepared from the purest vegetable
ingredients of great curative value. As it exerts a most bene-
ficial influence upon the stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels.
Most of the disorders due to derangement of the digestive
system speedily disappear after a course of
