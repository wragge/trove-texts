Montparnasse and La Rotonde
“Montparno,” as the initiated call their
quarter, “is the centre of the world. - ’ Those
who make this flamboyant assertion are the
inhabitants of its borders, some of them even
mere wayfarers, or exiles who have imbibed,
or affected, a little of its life. It is true,
however, that along the 1500 yards which
lie between the Gare Montparnasse and the
Carrefour Observatoire, at the junction of
fhe great boulevards Port Royal and Saint
Michel, one may encounter types from all
countries whose young men and women are
feverishly seeking expression for the life and
thought which the modern world is creating.
Ultra-modernism stalks unabashed along the
Montparno. There is confusion and elbow-
ing of diverse races without, hostile collision.
The strange accents, languages and idioms
that reach the ears cause neither astonish-
ment nor amusement to the blase Parisian
who saunters along like a stranger and a
foreigner in his own city.
The main features of the Boulevard Mont-
parnasse are its caffe, its innumerable
restaurants and its bookshops. ‘ln the Car-
refour Vavin, where the Boulevard Kaspail
cuts the Montparnasse, stands on the north-
ern side near the metro entrance the famous
Cafe la Rotondc. faced on the other side of
the Boulevard by its rival, the Cafe du
Dome. It is at this spot that five continents
mingle in the persons of their bizarre repre-
sentatives.
In the days when I first knew Paris La
Rotonde was but an insignificant “Boite,”
o mere “zinc” with its four or five poor tables
inside around a charcoal stove, and outside
a few little rickety chairs and round tables
on the pavement under the trees. Since the
war its prosperity has grown amazingly, and
it has become one of the great etallisscnients
of post-war Paris. In the evening it. flames
like a casino upon the waterfront of Nice or
Monte Carlo, and its numerous clientele
overflows upon the boulevard.
In the old days it was famous as a haunt
of Bohemians of genius, and of would-be
genius. Painters, daubers, poets, poetasters
and snobs formed a circle into which came
Guillaume Apollinaire, Salmon, Cocteau.
Picasso the Spaniard and Modigliani. They
drank their cafe and apefos as honored
guests. Neo-impressionism, symbolism and
cubism arc amongst its memories, and have
left strange pictures and daubs upon its
walls which are covered with the work of
youth shrieking for notice. Amateurs in
revolutions, both literary and social, came
there and still conic. Experimenters in social-
ism and communism paraded their theories
in its heated discussions. On occasions
in its smoke-laden atmosphere there were
politicians and revolutionaries of another
type amongst its customers men who
were biding their time, who listened to the
babblers and theorists and said little.
Authentic tradition relates with glee that
Trotsky played chess at La Rotonde in the
old days, whilst Lunatcharsky, the play-
wright, Minister for Fine Arts and Educa-
tion in Bolshevik Russia, passed moments) of
leisure and relaxation within its grimy walls.
When Charlie Chaplin came to Paris for
the first time one of the sights lie at once
asked to see Was this cafe. It was the only one
of its kind he had heard of in Los Angeles.
He was conducted there by his guides and
afterwards to Le Dome and to the little
Cafe du Parnasse. At all three he had a
hearty welcome. He was surrounded by the
curious crowd, feted, and received such an
uproarious ovation that he withdrew deaf-
ened, aching and exhausted. The crowd at
the Cafe du Dome was 50 per cent. Yankee.
Still Charlie is a great favorite with the
French people, because he can let himself go
and is a really great creator.
There is a very considerable sprinkling
of cubist drawings in the lower cafe. Some
claim the genesis of cubism for the Spani-
ard Picasso, a former customer of the
Rotonde; others are equally vociferous on
behalf of a Frenchman, Georges Braque. It.
doe§ not seem to matter very much to-day,
for cubism is as dead as dadaism. There
is a strong tradition that it really originated
in the practical joke of a number of young
hooligan painters at the Lapin Agile of
Montmartre. They are said to have steeped
a brush in all the colors of the paintbox,
and then fastened it firmly to the tail of
a good-humored donkey. They then tickled
the ass, and persuaded him to splash the
colors with his queue upon a juxta-posed
canvas. Picasso was amongst the gang,
and he it was who in a moment of exhila-
ration presented the result to a German
amateur of Fine Art as the formula of a
new school. The Herr Doktor took the
canvas to Berlin, and lectured learnedly
upon it. German Science and Criticism
shrink at nothing.
To-day La Rotonde is a garish palace
of several floors, many tables, all clean, and
waiters of an irreproachable air and dress. Its
fame is firmly established amongst the artists
of Montparno. The Rohemianism of money
rubs shoulders with the Bohemianism of
poverty. It has conquered the Boulevard
Saint Michel and the Latin Quarter. It
has stretched out its hands as far as Mont-
martre. and attracts crowds of nondescripts
from the north of Paris. At night it is a
babel where all languages, from English to
Japanese, are spoken. Very occasionally
one hears by chance a few sentences in
French ; but Spanish. Italian, German and
Yankee English are the dominant tongues.
Fashion is no tyrant here. Out upon
commonplace clothing which any citizen can
wear! Everybody at the Rotonde dresses as
it plonseth the individual fantasy. There is
no law, no rule, except the caprice of choice
which would fain disguise its poverty, its
ugliness or indulge its vanity. One' man
wears an overcoat from the ghetto, another
a military cloak which has been turned into
a garb of peace by the addition of a rabbit-
skin collar. One dark-skinned fellow adorns
his head with a turban, another prefers to
screw on *his cranium a fur cap. The faces
are strange. For one of a regular type there
are 10 eccentric and peculiar. There are
more thick lips than thin; more crooked
noses than Grecian. Features are sharp,
the color of the face is pale. Eyes born
with a feverish light. Women add' a note of
painted coquetry to this gathering. They
are as interesting to the eyes of the stranger
as their male companions. Here is one whose
dress must have been cut out of a window
curtain: another is wearing a panther skin
which looks like a bedroom rug donned in a
hurry. There is a constant movement, a
perpetual coming and going and a feverish
activity. Upstairs a jazz orchestra is play-
ing, and its blatant sounds burst in upon the
ears in great waves and then recede away
into the distance like a capricious tide. It
is a sign that even Paris and Montparnasse
are becoming Americanised, and that you
must seek elsewhere for the old French
Bohemianisih and the veritable flavor of the
Gallic spirit.
FRANCIS JACKSON.
Darrell Figgis
When, a couple of months ago, Darrell
Figgis met death at his own hands a par-
ticularly interesting figure passed from the
political and literary stage, lie was com-
paratively young, yet he had made his mark
in both departments of life. In politics he
will go down to history as the man chiefly
responsible for drafting the Constitution of
the Irish Free State. In- literature his
achievement w r as vaguer, but he had written
some poetry of distinction, a novel or two
and much good criticism. Even at the time
of his death lie was engaged on an import-
ant work on the prosody of Milton.
It was at a little cafe in Fleet-street that I
first met Figgis. He was with Ralph Hodg-
son, the poet, who was then editing Fry’s
Magazine, and in contrast looked a rather
subdued figure. Subdued, and a trifle color-
less. No one ever mistook Hodgson for any-
thing but a poet, in spite of his deliberately
unliterary talk, and his way of suggesting a
game of billiards when the conversation
drifted towards verse. Figgis, on the other
hand, might have been a clerk in some good
old-fashioned solicitor’s office. He had, in
fact, been a clerk for a firm of tea-merchants,
and when he turned to literary journalism
he did it in a sober, practical way, becoming
a reader for J. M. Dent and Co., the pub-
lishers, and writing efficient articles on all
sorts of critical subjects. A couple of years
before, Chesterton had been enthusiastic
about his first book of verse, but he showed
no disposition to follow it up with another.
Ilis main ambitions just then were towards
novel-writing.
His chief difficulty seemed to be the at-
tainment of a style. This does hot mean
that he was preoccupied with words and
rhythms, or that he lacked fluency. Style
is a more subtle matter, the achievement of
a harmony between thoughts and utterance—
always a difficulty for a man who has grown
up in one environment and been thrust into
another. The young English or French writer,
with his clearly-marked tradition at the back
of him and his audience waiting in front,
never suffers very acutely from this feeling
of disharmony. In spite of the factor of
personal idiosyncrasy, his subject-matter and
method of approach are marked out for liim.
But to the Irish writer, and even to the
Scotch, there is a question of attitude to be
solved. What shall he write about, and for
whom? Shall he take his own racial back-
ground for granted and make the most of it,
or shall he master the accents and tone of a
more sophisticated world? It is a question
that prevents the early growth of a natural
style far more effectively than any difficulty
about words or rhythm, and because of it
we see even born writers like Stevenson
hesitating uncertainly at the starting-post,
while fluent young men from Oxford or Put-
ney, without any particular talent, sail off
easily along their appointed course.
Darrell Figgis was clearly not meant to
write in the craggy, Mercdithian style he
adopted in his earlier novels; they were
the exercises of a young man in search off
himself. So, more or less, was his book on
the Elizabethan theatre, though it was very
competent. During those years before the
war he poured out articles on every con-
ceivable- kind of literary subject, yet he
always seemed a man who had not quite
found his feet. One of them, it is true,
was firmly planted on the steps of a solid
publishing-house, but the other hovered un-
certainly in thp air. Business (man, or
creative writer, though, In' gave no hint of
ambitions outside the London literary world.
So definitely was he associated with that
atmosphere that I remember getting a shock
when I met him again in Dublin after the
war. What a change had come over him in
those? few years ! , Even physically he seemed
to have become another man. and sitting on
the table of his office, swinging liis legs, he
looked and spoke like Shaw, with his red
beard and his aggressive tilt of the chin.
He had suffered two long terms of imprison-
ment because of his connection with the
rebellion; and he was then editing a little
weekly of liis own, the REPUBLIC, with its
sub-title in Irish, a language lie had not
thought of learning before. Some fresh
stream of energy had been unlocked in him.
He had become a fluent speaker, an orator
who could move crowds, lie was not at all
like the clerkly, assiduous man of letters
who had such a knack of finding the easiest
way into the offices of tin 4 literary weeklies.
And whether sitting in his own little office
overlooking the Liffe-y, or walking home from
"A.E.’s” after midnight, his talk was all of
politics. Hi 1 had lost interest in his old
companions of Fleet-street; he spoke of it
as a by-way he had left behind. The world
really did seem plastic in those days, and
everyone was a little optimistic about shap-
ing it anew by political arrangements.
Apart from this, though, Figgis was person-
ally enamored of his new role as a man of
action. Very few of the Irish leaders at that
time could both talk and write effectively.
Figgis had suddenly achieved a fluent, per-
suasive style and was an impressive figure
on the platform, so that the attention of

Measurement of Blank Verse
When in his article on the measurement of
blank verse Mr. Adamson writes: “This
formula, within certain limits, is, of course,
subject to variations which do not at present
concern us,” I feel that I must be mistaken
to imagine that he is concerned with little
other than variations. But Mr. Adam-
son is hardly fair to his own idea when he
uses as an example of an iambic pentameter
with four stresses a line that really has six.
Notwithstanding his wish to include
sonnets, elegiac stanzas and couplets under
the heading of blank verse, it appears that
Mr. Adamson wishes to discuss the iambic
pentameter, whether blank or loaded. Now,
if the words are allowed to say themselves,
The pro||pei - stu||dy of man||kincl is man||
is pure prose from any point of view, and
the line has the four stresses that Mr. Adam-
son has discovered. But
Sij|lent upon a peak|| in Da||rien
has only three, while
Of pure]l ablujjtion round] | earth’s!] hu||man shores||
has six, and
Rough!l winds|| do sliake|| the dar||ling buds|| of
May 11
has six also. And if we are to go into the
“pleasing glide” idea we could take
I sung of cha|}os and eter]|nal night]|
and, putting a little soap on "sung,” glide
over it and make the first stress “chaos.”
The result is a three-stress line. If “Shaks-
peare runs definitely to the four-stress line,”
then the less Shakspeare he! But
Am I the first]| that have been per|jjur’d so?
has only two stresses.
I don’t know who said that
Deep|| in the sha||dy sad]|ness of a vale||
had five stresses.
English prosodists do not measure English
verse by classical scansion, although in some
ways “the clumsily-devised formula of feet
based on accents” may be a little more help-
ful to the student than the notion that the
common English ten-syllable line has regu-
larly four feet. Moreover, there arc degrees
of stress, and “foot” and “stress” are not.
synonymous terms. English verse measure
is based more upon time than upon accent.
Although there may be no complete analogy
between verse form and the form of music,
the matter of time does intrude forcibly and
impose itself upon that of accent.
The art in writing English blank verse
seems to lie in the variation of stresses
and pauses and the arrangement of vowel
sounds. Blank verse, having no rhyme
attachment, depends for its music almost
entirely upon these devices; and so arise
the variations Mr, Adamson has observed.
There may be more than ten syllables and
almost as many as ten stresses, if the poet has
something very emphatic to say. What law
there is allows the writer plenty of latitude.
The words are the sheep, prosody is the dog,
and the poet is the drover. Members of the
flock may jump up or down, or wander for
a nibble to the roadside, but under the
drover’s commands the dog keeps order,
maintains the flock-form and gives it the
desired direction. The “feet” make only the
skeleton of the rhythm ; it is too often for-
gotten that the chief and subtlest pleasure
in reading verse lies in the effort the reader
makes to resist the mechanical prosodic basis
of the poem that the poet had to keep in
mind while writing it. The words are not
tortured into a humdrum succession of
accents, but are read with natural emphasis
without losing the spirit of the rhythm that
hovers in and over them; and this is what
has stirred Mr. Adamson.
English prosody sits upon the language
like a nicely-fitting summer dress on a nicely-
shaped girl. The young lady may sit or
stand or walk or play tennis. Whether
there is a dead calm or a blowing gale, the
garment adapts itself to all internal and
external changes, never falls off, and always
appears to fit. Although those wonderful
Greek terminologies for prosody and rhetoric
would help us to scan scientifically any line
of English verse, our language is so fluid
and its effects so subtle that it would be
difficult to find any two experts (if there
are two) who would agree on any particular
analysis of a free English rhythm. Since
it began to free itself from classical conven-
tions and flow into its natural periods the
language has made its own rhythm. The
law, if it is ever formulated, will be founded
upon the practice of the poets, and not
upon the ideas of the theorists; and before
we go any farther, to prevent dialectical
entanglement, we should agree (1) that
our verse-form depends upon both time and
accent for its rhythm, and (2) on account
of subtle and obvious differences in their
character, rhymed- verse must not be called
blank verse for any purpose or at any time.
The difference between blank verse and verse
written in rhymed stanzas is something like
the difference between a river and a lake.
After we have agreed that both are composed
mainly of water, we must admit that they
have different habits.
And, finally, if blank verse has not five
feet, but four, would Mr. Adamson be good
enough to tell us what sort of feet they
are? He has found in a “double-sigh” line
something that might stand amplification—
the “three-moan,” the “four-sob,” the “one-
groan.” and so on. He should now go on
and name the feet.

that we consider the scholar a dry-as-dust
creature? There are exceptions, of course;
here in Sydney are some notable ones. But
the popular idea of the scholar is someone
so wrapped up in books and so apart from
workaday concerns as to be “ ’ardly ’uming.”
Compared with him, members of the learned
professions seem to possess a complete
knowledge of good and evil, especially evil,
and even clergymen are worldly-wise. This
idea you will find current in literature, from
the hoary .jest of the scholar who wished to
sell his house and came into the market-
place offering a stone as a sample, to Brown-
ing’s grand but rather terrifying presentment
of the Renascence pedant in “The Gram-
marian’s Funeral.”
Scholars themselves are conscious of this
other-worldliness. In one of his lectures
Gilbert Murray, quoting another scholar,
says: “We all know that ghosts will not
speak until they have drunk blood: and we
must give them the blood of our hearts.”
And he goes on:—
To do this is the great sacrifice and the great
privilege of a scholar's life. It is for this that we
are content to become what we are, a somewhat blood-
less company, sensitive, low-spirited, lacking in
spring ; in business ill at ease ; in social life thin and
embarrassed, objects of solicitude to kind hostesses.
We have, more than most people, the joy of having
given ourselves up to something greater than our-
selves.... And for us personally it is surely some-
thing that our work is cast in such an exquisite
material. .. .the bricks and mortar out of which we
build are the words and thoughts of th»se great
men of the past. Damaged and one-sided we doubtless
are. Most professions damage a man in some way.
But if one must suffer some injury, it is not so
bad an injury to have one’s mind filled a little too
full of the thoughts of Euripides or Virgil or
Isaiah.
Here is the scholar’s apology, a confession
of general ineffectiveness when dealing with
persons and present actualities, but at the
same time a claim that the work of scholar-
ship has its worth for the world. Murray,
by the way, was anything but ineffective as
a propagandist in the United States during
the war. And liis work on the Council of
the League of Nations will not be forgotten.
But the scholar who keeps in touch with
men and events, whose learning is lightened
by a fund of human anecdote, can be an
attractive figure indeed. George Saintsbury,
tlie veteran scholar and critic, is emphatically
one of these. He is the author of ponderous
tomes on prosody and English prose rhythm
which are too technical for the* general
reader. But during his long and strenuous
life he has produced standard works on
English and French literature which are far
from dull. And in these latter years he has
published several scrap-books of obiter dicta
in which he discourses of anything and
everything that occurs to him. They make
most entertaining reading. He seems equally
at home in discussing names of racehorses,
rod hair, the charm of ugliness and the Oxford
Movement. As one goes on an engaging per-
sonality emerges. He is by nature inclined to
be testy—he drops the remark that chess
was the only game he, ever lost his temper
at, though he is afraid he has frequently
lost it over other things—but lie can claim
that lie has “never felt rancour.” His con-
sidered work, indeed, is remarkably free
from heat and bias, and lie has given one
of the finest estimates in critical literature
of Shelley, though the political opinions of
the poet were abhorrent to him.
There are many reminiscences in the
‘•‘Scrap Books” of’ his undergraduate and
graduate days at Oxford. He counts himself
fortunate to have gone to Merton. His dis-
position at that time was somewhat like the
badger’s, but he was not allowed to dig
himself into retreat. In politics he has
always been • strongly Tory, a term he pre-
fers to Conservative, and has been an active
journalist on that side. His views on
education would be counted reactionary by
many. In his day the guiding principle of
Oxford tuition was “Can’t you let him
alone?” which he himself prefers to the
“purest pearls of Pelmanism.” And he is
rather scornful of the careful supervision
of reading accorded to the undergraduate
nowadays. Similarly, the modern elabora-
tion of systems in schools, annual head-
masters’ conferences, the advocating of
mental tests and what not come in for some
shrewd thrusts. He says roundly that more
than half the children tested ought not to
be at school at all. His particular sarcasm,
however, is reserved for the idea of “a
primer dealing with the evolution of human
society,” which Philip Snowden recommended
to his followers. One cannot help thinking
of Wells’s “Outline of History,” though
Saintsbury does not mention it. But this
notion of acquiring the elements of world
knowledge through cheap and easy primers
seems to him typical of the Labor party,
which is for ever talking of the capitalist
“system,” as if it had been thought out and
designed entire, whereas, like Topsy, it “just
growed.” His attitude to women shows a
charming Victorian gallantry. With regard
to the later developments off higher edu-
cation, lie says: “There should be something
desirable that is not in Oxford.” But that
is a mild regret. He speaks of having en-
joyed lecturing in logic to some bright young
girls in the early days of the University
Extension movement, and says that studies
of that kind do not spoil their dancing.
Like Meredith’s Dr. Middleton, Saints-
bury is knowledgeable in wines. One of his
recent works, “Notes on a Cellar-Book,” lias
been judged as exquisite in its way as “The
Compleat Angler.” He disagrees with Mere-
dith about the longevity of port. He has
found that ordinarily the red wines wane
sooner than tlie white. But he gives port
its duo:
It has not the almost feminine grace and charm
of Claret,: the transcendental qualities of Burgundy
and Madeira; the immediate inspiration of Cham-
pagne : the rather unequal and sometimes palling
attractions of Sauterne and Moselle and Hock. But
it strengthens while it gladdens as no other wine
can do: and there is something about it which
must have been created in pre-established harmony
with the best English character.
It is difficult to give the phrases and
anecdotes full value out of their context.
But from this treasury of romantically-
named liquors, with accompaniments of joro-
boam, tappit-hen and the like, and their
appropriate cellar arrangements, one may
perhaps take two more quotations. Of Irish
whisky lie says that “when it is good, it
has tlie national characteristic of being
(with the same limitation) singularly in-
gratiating. No spirit makes you appreciate
so fully that beautiful line,
And the soft wings of Peace cover him round.”
In the chapter on beer and cider he relates
how he once ordered a cask of Bass, and it
came “affectionately labelled ‘Mr. George
Saintsbury. Full to the bung.’ I detached
the card,” he says, “and I believe I have it
to this day as my choicest (because quite
unsolicited) testimonial.”
In these playtime essays and jottings, even
more than in his works of serious criticism,
Saintsbury exhibits his humanity, his humor
and his generous zest. No one, surely, could
call a scholar of this kind desiccated.
BEATRICE TILDESLEY.
The Universal Language
The periodical references of Red Page writers
to the benefits of Esperanto or some other
existing or suggested artificial tongue seem
to point to a common belief that the world
is badly in need of a universal language.
“Umfaan” (4/2/’2t>), discussing Esperanto
and the tendency “to get back to a universal
language such as must have existed in the
cradle of the human race,” says that “a
common language could easily be found
for the Teutonic races” were it not that the
idealising and sanctifying of the “mother
tongue” for centuries is “hard to combat
suddenly.” Does he mean to suggest that,
in the event of the evolving of such a lan-
guage, the various Teutonic races would be
expected to abandon their native tongues
and take up the new one? If he does, then
lie over-rates greatly the possibilities and
scope of any universal language formed in
this way. There is undoubtedly a great use
for such a language as pidgin English, and
it is true that, when two different peoples
come into contact through commerce, they
tend to evolve a common jargon. But the
sphere and utility of such a medium of
expression is strictly limited.
The case of the languages of the Esperanto
and Ido types is entirely different, however;
they pretend not only to be commercial and
generally useful internationally, but also to
be literary and national, which is absurd.
Whatever their merits commercially and
internationally (and I do not suspect that
after all they are very great), they certainly
can have no claim to literary or national
value.
If we wish to verify this statement, we
have only to examine for a moment the
nature and peculiarities of that mysterious
and incomprehensible thing we call language.
It is essentially a thing that grows. Its
form is never fixed or ultimate; it is ever
in the becoming. It has its environment, its
people, its climate, its history and its setting
in the evolution of humanity. In order to
see an example of the growth and develop-
ment of a language, we need only compare
our own English during the various stages
from the time of the Norman Conquest until
the present day. If we wish to see the way
in which it is affected by a people and a
climate, we have only to compare, for in-
stance, modern French, modern Spanish and
modern Italian, which all originally came
from a common source. Let us take from a
people speaking a certain tongue two groups
and send one of them to live at the pole
and the other to live at the equator. Then
let us listen to their language after a few
centuries. It is probable that one group
would not understand the other.
Even if we grant that the world would
accept such a universal language, fixed and
stagnant as it would be, how long would it
remain universal? Its form would certainly
not remain long the same; it would not be
long in assuming a state of flux, and, once
that happened, how could it be controlled?
In some districts new words would come in
and old words would go out, independently
of the other districts; the pronunciation
would alter differently according to the
climate; vowels would weaken and finally
crumble away. The language would certainly
not develop along the same lines everywhere,
and, in spite of the improved facilities
for transport and intercommunication be-
tween the various parts of the world to-day,
we would have a repetition of the case of
Latin, only the disintegration would proceed
more slowly.
Taking Esperanto or Ido as examples, it
is their very regularity which is their greatest
obstacle in aspiring to a national, and, above
all, to a literary character; for it is the
nature of the irregularities in any language
that sets the final stamp on its beauty
and individuality. What would English,
French and German be without their irregu-
larities, without their idioms? For it is
idiom which is the life of language, inherent
in its nature, and. since it is whimsical and
not to be explained by any formula or
rule, providing that atmosphere of mystery
and picturesqueness which is so necessary in.
the speech of a people, in literature and,
above all, in poetry.
It must be admitted that Dr. Zamenhof’s
language, although its creation is intrinsi-
cally a highly creditable performance, and
although it must always remain an interest-
ing phenomenon, is nothing more than a big
mistake. The world, in any case, thank
Heaven, is not ready for a universal lan-
guage. If there could be one it would evolve
naturally and of its own accord. It would
be the product of the peoples, and not of a
single brain.
I. A. H.
The Money-box, by Robert T.ynd (Methuen). Essays
nowadays attract but few authors arid appeal to but
a scant public. Among the few who still count in
this department of letters is the author of the present
collection. Just as the money-box receives a
variety of coins of different values, so within this
little volume are collected papers that touch topics
of many kinds and invariably do it with grace and
quiet humor. Good for a leisure hour —when it
comes.
The Haven, by Dale Collins (Heinemann). “Ordeal”
lifted this young Australian author into the ranks of
novelists from whom much is expected. The Pacific
island stage for his new original and fantastic
story provides merely a setting for a romance which
owes nearly all its significance to psychological
studies of character under conditions possible only
in the region of imagination. Mr. Collins makes a
heavy draft on the reader’s credulity; but once that
obstacle is overcome and the postulate that all is
possible in romance admitted, the story holds the
mind by its ingenuity, its power of analysis and
satire and the clever drawing of the central figure,
Mark Antoine, kinema star, “the handsomest man,”
marooned with a group of adoring women on an
isolated coral island.

JJOW MANY WIVES have
heard their husbands complain
that they have hit a stone wall in
business? How many wives have
seen their husbands grow old waiting
for “the big things” to come their way,
while living expenses go steadily up
and up and up?
The number must run into millions.
Yet we know, from our experience
with 180,000 husbands, that in nine
cases out of ten something can be done
about it.
We have a little book which we
have printed especially for dissatisfied
men. It is called “Forging Ahead in
Business.” It shows just what happens
to a man’s business worries when he
broadens his knowledge of business
principles; just why some men reach
their limits young, while others go to
the top; just what the Institute s training
can mean to your business career if you
will follow it through.
It is a helpful, practical little book.
A good many men have read it, and
found it worth an evening’s time.
Among them are numbered the
administrative heads of just about
50,000 concerns.

STERNOL British, MOTOR OILS
make engines purr *
A/[ ANY letters from pleased users in all parts of the
1V 1 world stress this one fact—“Sternol is a Power-oil’ 5
an oil that makes a wonderful and immediate difference
to the running of a car. Sternol is on top” because it
will enable you to get on top without harm to the engine
where another oil would “stall” you. Instant response,
smooth, easy running, greater pulling power and less
depreciation—can an oil make all this difference? With
one trial you can prove that “Sternol” will do it.
Messrs. Sterns, Ltd., have been manufacturing lubricants for over half a century
—before the first motor-car was made. This is why “Sternol” is so good.
Makers of leading British Cars, following the lead of the makers of the
admirable “Austin.” are using and recommending “Sternol.”

The Return.
I said “When I return again
To Sydney Town beside the sea,
Come sunlight or the fall of rain
Across the dawn, my heart will be
So glad, so glad I shall forget
The leaning palms, the surging roll
On the long glowing reef.” And yet
Colors are burning in my soul.
Scarlet of flame-trees in the noon,
Blood-red hibiscus, the bright gold
Of beaches lone where the slow croon
Of waves is ceaseless- —waves that liola
The drowning jewels—fill my dreams,
’Neath peacock arches, sunset-flushed,
Ere the light sinks and ivory gleams
The new moon through green twilight
hushed.
Brown women through my dreaming trail
Down emerald tides; and far and far
On a blue sea-rim a lone sail
Glimmers and fades. Scents, colors are
Haunting me all the day and night—
Drift-fragrance from dark ivi-trees,
The breath of frangipanni white,
Sighs from isles lost in glowing seas.
I hear in endless palms that sway
O’er dawn-washed shores the rainlike slow
Soughing of wind; and far away
From Sydney Town my tranced thoughts
go.
I am not free from strange desire.
Spellbound, I dream within my own
Loved city of the silver fire
Of stars above an island lone.

Lace.
This lovely lace is exquisite, a rare
And filmy fabric, every silken fold
Of texture delicate beyond compare,
The tint of precious ivory and old.
Romance is woven with its gossamer,
Enmeshed in clinging cobweb, soft and fine,
Fragrant with bergamot arid lavender.
A vase of roses forms the quaint design.
A lady prized the kerchief long ago.
A dream of loveliness, she led the dance,
Perfect from powdered head to silver toe.
From jewelled comb to scarlet heel. Her
glance
Bewitching flashed above the scented lace ;
And he for whom she smiled and let it fall
Adored her beauty, loved her lissome grace
And, bravely wooing, won her at the ball.
A woman worked it in a northern town,
Fine laces weaving in a chilly room.
From early dawn until the sun went down
And daylight darkened into twilit gloom
She heard the people passing in the street.
The playing children called across the
green;
She often dreamed of love. Her dreams were
sweet;
She sometimes wept for joy that might
have been.
For many days and years she bowed her head
Above the pillow, eyes intent, her face
Bent low above the bobbin and the thread.
Deft fingers wrought the pattern of the lace
Until at last this lovely thing was done.
And then, with folded hands, forlorn and
blind,
She sat and felt the kindly summer sun
And heard the whispers of the evening
wind.

The Player.
O fiddle of years,
As you sing so low
From your misty window of long ago,
Dusk comes marching with ashen spears
That are sharp with woe.
Ah! why do you sing with a sound of tears
In the dark so low,
Fiddle of years,
O fiddle of years!
“Never again,”
Does your music say,
“Shall the gold come back to the skies of
grey”?
Like a lost wind sobbing an olden pain
Where the black boughs sway,
Your echoes drift with the drifting rain
Through the dark to say:
“Never again,
Oh, never again !”
Fiddle of years,
Will you haunt me still
Though the skies are blind o’er the wind-
swept hill ?
Who plays? Who plays? Oh, yo-ur music
sears
Like a flame grown chill!
Has Death freed Love with its dreams and
fears ?
Is she calling still,
Fiddle of years?
Heart’s delight,
Are you playing yet
That fiddle of years with its haunting fret
Past the doors of death and the awful night,
With its blind stars set?
Is there ever a way in the grave's despite
For your music yet,
Heart’s delight.
Oh, heart’s deljght?
“Never again,”
Does your sobbing say,
“Shall the singer sing or the player play—
’Tis a madness born of a grief-sick brain
In the dark astray”?
Oh, fiddle of years, with your dumb refrain,
Is it this you’d say:
“Never again.
Oh. never again”?

THE HUMILIATION OF LANG—AND
WHAT NEXT?
After a campaign marked by sordid man-
oeuvres, some of which have had no parallel
in the history of any other Parliament in
Australia, or perhaps the world, Lang, the
N.S.W. Premier who mistakes dull obstinacy
and rudeness for strength, learned last week
what it is to fail and be laughed at. He
had commanded his. followers to attend a
special session and complete the abolition of
the Leg. Council, which abolition was un-
mentioned in his policy speech and kept out
of sight at the election that gave his party a
majority of two seats, although it had a
minority of 17,000 votes. He had promised
members of the tln-eatened Chamber life
passes over the N.S.W. Government rail-
ways, and those of other States and the
Commonwealth if it could be managed, to-
gether with life membership of the Macquarie-
street club, where meals and liquor are
served at cost price (or less) and the library
is worth £5 ss. p.a. of any man’s money, and
retention for life of the title “Hon.” Abo-
litionists were told that they would have the
immense gratification of seeing their names
on “Labor’s Roll of Honor.” which is not to
be confounded with 1914-18 honor rolls; on
the other hand, anti-abolitionists of the
Labor persuasion were warned to expect a
full issue of the penalties reserved for their
kind since 1916, to which exclusion from
trade-unions that enjoy preference of em-
ployment is to be added, if it can be arranged.
Nor could any such anti-abolitionist ever
hope to become a Labor alderman and men-
tion “four fifties” or anything of the kind
to a municipal contractor or ratepayer seek-
ing a concession.
*****
Confident that everything necessary had
been done and said or impressed on the
imagination, the Labor Premier announced
that the Abolition Bill was certain to be
carried, and encored himself daily, although
other Laborites grew doubtful and hinted
at the possibility of “treachery.” It was
on Tuesday that the gentleman got what
was coming to him. On that day leave to
introduce the bill was formally applied for
by Willis, leader of the Leg. Council and
the most lamentable dud in the Ministry
next to his chief. According to the Premier’s
assurances to Governor De Chair, the Gov-
ernment had 45 pledged supporters in the
Council—2o old members and 25 nominated
in December —in addition to whom there
were two unpledged abolitionists, the versa-
tile Mclntosh and M. J. Connington, who
has been out of the party since the conscrip-
tion business. Nevertheless, the clumsy
Willis could muster only 41 votes, his own
included, while the Noes numbered 47. T.
G. Murray, a Storey Government nominee,
was missing from the Ayes; so were C. A.
Akhurst, W. P. Kelly, J. D. Lyons and
D. M. Smith, of the Lang vintage. Akhurst
arrived just after the division was taken and
explained that he hadn’t meant to be late,
but it is common talk that if there had been
any danger of the bill being carried several
other uplifters of the downtrodden masses,
representing both the 1921 and 1925 cre-
ations, would have had urgent engagements
elsewhere or contrived to fall ill. Among the
Noes was J. W. Percival, a Storey pro-
tege, whose absence from the division last
session resulted, to use his own words, in
“the whole police and detective force being
put on my track to shadow me as though I
were a criminal.” Anticipating his expul-
sion, which will be pronounced anyhow, he has
resigned from the Labor party, saying,
among other things, that his late leader is a
dictator, a salary-grabber (“he gave himself
an extra £lO a week before anything had
been . done for the workers on the basic
wage”) and a Premier who, by instructing
Leg. Councillors to “dishonor their word
and break pairs,” had “torn political honor
to shreds.” An even more notable non-
content is F. H. Bryant, who was the Minis-
terial Whip in the Leg. Council until he re-
volted against the command that he should
break a pair. “I have been 40 years in the
Labor movement,” said Bryant, “yet the
treatment I have received during the past
month is only what would have been meted
out to a galley slave. A man is only as good
as his word. I found that 1 could not take
the political word of the present leader of
the party, which I have stood by without
hope of reward, so I am resigning from it.”
*• *.**
There are others, not Laborites, whose
sentiments are the same as Bryant’s. In
the Lang policy speech the assurance was
given that “when the electors vote for Labor
candidates they vote for what is here pro-
posed, and not for anything else, so far as
the existence of the next Parliament is con-
cerned.” The Salary Grab Bill was passed
in defiance of this undertaking, which was
likewise repudiated in the Leg. Council Abo-
lition and Gold Pass Bribe Bills, and in the
flagrant measures disrating Digger railway-
men who were at the war in 1917 and those
who did not take part in the pro-Hun strike,
and wiping out their unions. None of these
wicked proposals was given in the list of
“what is hero proposed” ; neither was there any
allusion to the smellful plan whereby Sydney
ratepayers, who are not to be consulted by
referendum or in any other way, are to pay
£200,000 or more for the privilege of getting
four more Labor aldermen from slummy
Waterloo. What the people think of these
measures and the low breaches of faith asso-
ciated with them would be eloquently shown
if the Government went to the country, which
it is not at all likely to do. Yet what are
the alternatives ? It might carry on; but its
leader has declared again and again that he
cannot carry on with the present Council.
There remains, then, the hope that the Gov-
ernor may be induced to pass another score
or so of Lang’s nominees into the Chamber.
But the circumstances surrounding the Gov-
ernor’s acceptance of Lang’s last batch of
nominees make his Excellency’s acceptance
of another batch highly improbable. These
communications passed between Government
House and the Premier on December 4: —
Governor to Premier: Will not the addition of 25
to the number of Councillors mean in effect the
putting of an end to the Council’s value as a
deliberative and revising Chamber?
Premier to Governor: The addition of 25 to the
number of Councillors will not mean the putting of
an end to the Council’s value as a deliberative and
revising Chamber.
Little power is left to the Governor -
very properly-—but this one great safeguard
of the people's rights remains: he still has
the undisputed power to say to his advisers :
“I am doubtful whether you have the
country behind you. Go and find out.” He
must not do even this factitiously; he must
have solid ground to stand on. In the pre-
sent constitutional crisis there is more than
enough solid ground for his Excellency.- It
would alone be sufficient for his Excellency
to direct his principal adviser’s attention to
these two facts: (1) that the Premier
assured him that “the addition of 25 to the
number of Councillors will not mean the put-
ting of an end to the Council’s value as a
deliberative and revising Chamber”; (2)
that, having granted him the 25 additional
Councillors, the Premier did immediately
proceed to put an end to the Council’s value
as a deliberative and revising Chamber —
did indeed proceed to put an end to it alto-
gether. It is exceedingly doubtful whether
liis Excellency is justified in accepting any
further advice at all on any subject from this
Premier until, at any rate, his extraordi-
nary methods receive the endorsement of the
country. If they received that endorsement
there would, of course, be only one thing
for the Governor then to do.
WHEN SYDNEY IS GARDENGRAD.
That chronically bad-tempered institution,
the Russian Government of “People’s Com-
missaries,” has again been speaking its mind.
Frequent changes take place in the list of
commissaries, so it is always liable to have
an unfamiliar mind. Even Trotsky was
passed out in 1924, and passed in again in
1925. He is now said to have been eclipsed
by Stalin, who has also had his comings
and goings. No mention is made of any
popular or Parliamentary movement behind
these* changes. Apparently the commissaries
fix details among themselves. The present
situation is that the proposed conference re
the reduction of armaments was abandoned
because Russia, with a compulsory service
force of 500,000 or 700,000 men, including
foreign mercenaries, declined to have any-
thing to do with a meeting in Switzerland,
and showed no enthusiasm for one anywhere
else. Switzerland is a favorite spot for meet-
ings of diplomatists, because it is small,
neutral, unaggressive (it maintains no
standing army and it was recently taunted
with not having made war for seven cen-
turies), its Royal family has no marriage re-
lationships with reigning houses because it
doesn't possess one, the scenery is good, and
the drinks might be worse. But the Soviet
alleged that one of its functionaries had been
assassinated in Switzerland—which was
quite likely, for there are exiles and ruined
creditors almost everywhere who want to
shoot almost any Soviet official—and the
homicide had got away. Harnessed to this
refusal to have anything to do with the little
Republic was the official announcement that
“the next war will be a deadly struggle be-
tween the Soviets and capitalistic Powers,”
accompanied by an impassioned appeal to
the young to take more interest in warlike
affairs.
* * * *
The prophecy is likely enough to be
fulfilled, for the craving of the Soviet, which
has already confiscated, everything belonging
to capitalistic Powers that it could lay hands
on, to get at some more of their assets, is
intense. Russia’s European neighbors are all
small and feeble (Latvia, Esthonia and Lithua-
nia, which are supposed to threaten Petrograd
with an especially nasty threat, wouldn't make
another Victoria if added together), but the
pose of the commissaries, that Russia is a
small, nude Daniel in a den of crocodiles, all
shedding tears on purpose to deceive, is
pathetic. The reasons for probable Bol-
shevik aggression include the desire for
plunder, which set previous Huns and Van-
dals in motion. In addition there is
the missionary spirit, which caused the
Christian to pursue the heathen from
the Euphrates, and places even farther
east, to the tip of South America and to the
Arctic Ocean; which caused the Chris-
tians, w;hen they split, to pursue each other;
and which caused the Mohammedans to pur-
sue the lot. Now the Bolsheviks, having
established a new Atheist Church, would
take on the world-conversion job if they saw
their way, and. they mission so persistently
that even an industrial conference of per-
verted trade-unionists which met in Sydney
was greeted with congratulations and good
wishes from meddling Moscow, and replied
thereto. The Communist movement, which
grows with impunity in Australians engineered
by men of low wage-earning capacity who
visualise a time when Sydney will be re-
named Gardengrad, and when the low-wage-
earning cranks will all be commissaries, re-
appointing themselves and each other, and
all rich, as good commissaries should be,
and quite beyond the need to struggle after
chances as peculating aldermen or similar
small-fry. Then they will have their mer-
cenary foreign regiments, as the Soviet bosses
have, to protect them against people who
want the initiative, the referendum and the
recall. The commissaries supply all the
initiative that is allowed, and they refer
things to themselves, and any attempt to
recall them is a “counter-revolutionary
movement,” and is dealt with by the Tcheka.
This acts according to rules and regulations
which have never been published, but about
which the accused may gather something as
his case goes on.
* * * *
The attempt to turn Sydney into Garden-
grad, and otherwise adjust this country to
Soviet ways, is supported, as a matter of course,
by the bulk of the criminal classes, by a mass
of people whose education stopped at the age
of 14 or earlier, and whose intelligence
stopped at about the same spot, and by a
horde of ambitious cranks who all take it
for granted that they will be rich and potent
commissary-thieves when the new regime
gets going. Yet even in Russia, with all its
reputation for providing good steals for good
patriots, there were recently just 19 people
who were full-blown commissaries and
132,000,894 who weren’t, though a number
of the latter were inferior officials, ranging
down to street-sweepers, and many, as already
mentioned, were provided with positions as
compulsory privates in red livery. Which
shows that even the best and most blanky
upheaval may prove a disappointment for
want of enough palaces to go round.
ALL IN THE DAY’S WORK.
A few miles beyond the Burnt Bridge Hotel,
a memorial of some former fire, the road dives
into a narrow valley. There is a telephone
on one side and a toy railway on the other.
The rails, with their sleepers still hanging
to them, are festooned like lawyer-vines
across the tributary gullies, while the frag-
ments of the bridges are still burning under-
neath them. Wherever there is a fold in
the mountain-wall a branch line with wooden
rails wanders off to an obscure fate. Here
and there patches of undergrowth that have
inexplicably survived indicate how thick the
floor of this sub-tropical jungle, now like a
black velvet carpet, was before last Sunday
week. A wattle here and there flowers
bravely, but the trunks of the big gums sup-
port a roof of burnt-brown leaves that
stretches endlessly in all directions.
Ihe wooden church and a grocer’s shop
are all that are left of the township of Three
Bridges. A small boy with red eyelids re-
lates . how from two in the afternoon till
four in the morning they carried water from
the creek and poured it over the shop-roof.
Opposite, an untenanted shack with bush
crowding all about it irrationally remained
untouched. The town of Gilderoy is passed
as part and parcel of the burned-out scenery.
Coming back one fails to find it. Built out
o'f the material of its surroundings, it has
shared the common doom, and a sack or
two would accommodate all that is left of
its trials, tribulations, weddings and
funerals. An engine caught midway between
two bridges stands abandoned. Two men
who yesterday were fighting for their lives
are rebuilding a bridge. They work dumbly
and have no tale to tell. Life goes on, and
a man must eat, even if his own life is a
small thing and not of much value.
Powelltown is crammed into a sharp angle
in the mountain barrier. There is just room
for a narrow, sunken road, two rows of
wooden houses and the timber-mill. The
bush whereby the township gets its living
comes right down to the roadway. Its roof
of leaves hangs over the houses like a threat-
ening cloud. The fire licked up a row of
dwellings, spared the mill and Avent up the
opposite slope in a couple of easy strides.
In one corner it left behind a ferocious cari-
cature of domesticity in a twisted double-
bed and motor-bike. The place is full of
young men with their occupations gone and
barefoot children whose boots were burnt off
them. The children are bowling hoops picked
up out of the ruins of their homes. Near
here a truck-line strikes off across the ranges
to Worixey’s mill, where the 14 Tasmanians
lost their lives.
A mother who handed her baby to a fire-
fighter and never saw it again can't be
approached yet, but there is a youngster of
16 who has a tale and is eager to tell it.
He spent the day in a shallow pool and the
night in the ashes, and his lungs got full
of the black dust, which is a far worse
memory than the fire. But among the
grown-ups there is nobody who has a story.
A bush-fire is all in the day’s work, and the
survivors are more embarrassed than de-
lighted that the city is finding them so dra-
matically interesting. This isn’t the first
time they have had to fight for their lives
or homes. Not by a long chalk! That over-
hanging cloud has always been there, and
is always likely to be there. Nobody knew
better than they that it would break some
day and maybe overwhelm them. The
struggle for existence here is palaeolithic. The
telephone, the odd radio-set bringing the
latest musical-comedy into the wilderness,
the mail-car delivering the weekly papers—
these things do not alter the nature of the
struggle. Man blazes a track, and plants liis
mill where the timber is thickest, and around
it builds a little settlement of the material
that comes easiest. He cuts down the
bush if the ‘ bush will let him; if not, the
bush cuts him down. When the big trees
are gone he strikes his camp and moves
further on. to another struggle. Cultivation
moves in behind him, Nature is worsted in
that particular district, and people, forget-
ting the pioneer of to-day, sentimentalise
about the pioneer of former days, and busy
themselves about obtaining a 100-per-cent.-
pure milk supply. Men fought bush-fires
for their lives where crowds in Collins-street
now read the bush-fire extras. At Yarra
Junction, Mrs. X., a fresh-faced woman
whose husband, a timber-loader, will be out
of work to-morrow, is putting up and feed-
ing half a dozen refugees as a matter of
course, while down in Melbourne the relief
committees are posing for their photographs.
The question remains whether the city
has not larger responsibilities than even the
collection of relief funds. The bush-dwellers
do not do things better because they do not
know how—do not even suspect that they
ought to be done better. Powelltown, at which
we have already looked in passing, is a glar-
ing and horrible example. The village is a
haphazard collection of tumble-down shanties
built of slabs and roofed with the same
material. The miserable huts stand in a
thick crop of bracken fern; the bracken
chokes the tracks that serve as roadways
and is the only thing in the gardens. There
is very little clearing about them, and no
signs that any clearing has eVer been
attempted. The one miserable collection of
shops is a disgrace to any community. I
saw a butcher-shop there which is in such
a condition that one shudders to think what
the meat must be like when it survives the
assaults of flies and dust and gets into the
huts of the. inhabitants. True, the front
entrance has a fly wire-door. But half of
it has been kicked in, and the only window
in the place is broken. Yet it is a palace com-
pared with some of the houses that people
live in. When the fire swept down into
the hollow on three sides of the settlement
these huts were deserted, and the women and
children huddled on to the local bowling-
green until the fiend passed on. Seven of
the huts standing a little apart from the main
block were destroyed in a few minutes. Only
the hard work of the men and the burning
back of the fire saved the main block from
even quicker destruction. It would have been
a blessing in disguise had they all been swept
out of existence, albeit a terrible thing for
the people whoso homes they are.
The habitations in such villages must in
future be built to some ordered plan. As
they stand they are not fit for dogs to live
in. They are insanitary, ill-ventilated, un-
protected from fire; an insult to the finer
sensibilities of any civilised community. Now
that the first pangs of horror and sympathy
have passed the health and forestry authori-
ties should bestir themselves. If such places
cannot be made model villages, they can, at
any rate, be made reasonably safe to live
in, and reasonably ordered and decent. Under
present conditions it is not to be won-
dered at that the people take no measures
against the inevitability of the forest fire.
How can theirs be anything but an animal
life in such an environment?

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Hunger for Government Farms.
E. P. Fleming, N.S.W. Under-Secretary for
Lands, has published a few pertinent re-
marks on the theory that there is a vast
unsatisfied demand for land in his State.
When a choice Crown block is thrown open
there is invariably a rush for the prize, the
periodical land-distribution being regarded in
the same light as a Golden Casket or a
Tatt.’s sweep. On such occasions politicians
and a stray prelate or two hold forth copi-
ously on the multitude of land-seekers who
are being “robbed of their birthright” and
the need for the Government to “do something-
in the matter,” the number of applications
for a specially attractive area being quoted
as evidence. In point of fact, the applicants
are largely speculators, some of whom
wouldn’t work the block if they could, and
the others couldn’t if they would. The
Under-Secretary points out that his depart-
ment has a system of registering persons who
want to go on the land, or say they do. In
two years 4074 registered, more than half
stating that they had less than £3OO in cash
or plant. On a revision of the list last year
2330 names were removed, and only about
40 were restored, although a general
invitation to re-register was printed in “the
official publication, which contains particu-
lars of lands made available, and which was
regularly forwarded.” There were 707 new
registrations in 1924-25. They included per-
sons who engagingly acknowledged that they
didn’t own the price of a small beer. The
Under-Secretary puts it this way:—
Of the 707, 265 admitted that they had from nil
to less than £lOO in cash or plant; 124 said that
they had only £lOO to £3OO in cash or plant ; 90
represented that they had cash or plant amounting
from £3oio to £5OO ; and 228 claimed to have cash
or plant exceeding £5OO in value.
As regards experience, 55 confessed that
they had. none, 32 mentioned one year, and
564 “claimed” three years or more. In a
general summary the departmental chief
says:—
For any attractive block of Crown land thrown
open for lease or purchase on the extremely easy
terms provided in the Crown Lands Act, there ,s
a keen demand. .. .the total invariably including a
large percentage of persons who, on account of in-
sufficiency o-f capital or lack of experience or both,
could not themselves work the land with any pros-
pect of success. But where a fairly substantial
deposit has to be lodged and annual payments met,
the number of applicants. .. .is much smaller than
may be generally thought.
Yet the politicians aforesaid suggest that
Mr. Fleming’s department is besieged by
an army of rugged pioneers clamorous for
land. Also, that it is the Government’s
business to furnish farms for such as have
saved no money and acauired no experience
and spoon-feed them until “values have been
written down to a point at which the settler
will be able to succeed,” as Premier Lang
said in his policy speech, or until the Regis-
trar of Bankruptcy has been called in. The
lesson of the soldier-settlement scheme is
wasted on these spouters. The Under-Secre-
tary reports that since the inception of the
business in 1916, 9098 soldiers have been
allotted N. S. Wales farms and 2135 have
quitted them, the expenditure (including a
public-works outlay of £3,241,548) having
reached £17,384,539 on June 30, 1925. Of
the 6963 who are sticking to the job many
are in such a bad way that it has been de-
cided, as a general policy, to collect arrears
of interest in 10 annual instalments, as
from December 1, 1923, no interest being
chargeable on. the balance if the instalments
are paid as they fall due, and to extend the
term for repayment of the principal, arrears
of .which and penalty interest have been
waived. In N. S. Wales, though not in other
States, a clean A.I.F. discharge was accepted
as a qualification certificate for a soldier-
selection, experience being gaily disregarded.
This is not the sole cause of the terrific
losses on soldier-settlement, but it has led to
vast sums being thrown away in mostly-cruel
attempts to make farmers of town-bred Dig-
gers who would have been infinitely better
off in the trades or callings with which they
were familiar.

The Discouragement of Immigrants.
Britain runs an Overseas Settlement De-
partment to help its surplus population to
the Dominions, finding them land, assisted
passages and preliminary training. Last year
the Department had £994,000 to spend on
the good work, but contrived to get rid of
only £419,750. A rush to Australia was
expected, but, instead, the previous poor
figures showed a further drop of 2700. See-
ing that three-fourths of the money avail-
able for the training of young “migrants”
was unused, it looks as if the next year’s
rush will be poor likewise. This is a land
of diminishing attractions which is rapidly
attaining this point: (1) No man can
obtain employment at any honest and
productive occupation unless he is a mem-
ber of the proper and authentic union. (2)
It isn’t compulsory for the union to let him
in, however good his qualifications, though
to be out practically means starvation. (3)
While in the union his prospects are poor,
and they are not improving. He must
not accept an interest in the business, be-
cause that is profit-sharing. He must not
accept extra pay for extra-good work, be-
cause that is the bonus system, and may be
classed as speeding up. He must be content
in many places with what five days’ work
at a moderate pace will bring, the latest
development (it developed at Broken Hill
and in Sydney Municipal Council) being that
the doing of any remunerative work or odd
job in spare days or hours is to be a deadly
sin, and punishable at discretion. And the
scanty wage is eaten into by many dues and
levies. (4) The way out of the union is
remarkably easy. Even a cloudy accusation
about “conduct prejudicial to the best inter-
ests of unionism” may cause a member's
subscription to be refused, whereupon he
passes into outer darkness without trial.
Work is not increasing much, though im-
ports are plentiful enough, and rules, regu-
lations and disabilities are like sands on the
seashore for multitude. Australia, though
not blessed with the unlimited resources
which its too-numerous estate-agents allege,
may easily he a Land of Promise again : but
for the time Promise is distinctly “off.”
A Row About a Bridge.
The comic opera of the Hawthorn Bridge
has thrown a light on the municipal muddle-
ment in the midst of which the citizen of
Melbourne lives. The consensus of opinion
is that the bone of contention between the
contending councils is decrepit and liable to
collapse at an early date. The Richmond
Council, to save loss of life, proposed to
close the bridge, but the Hawthorn Council,
annoyed because Richmond had thought of
it first, declared for keeping the tottering
structure open and applying temporary re-
pairs. The next move was made by Rich-
mond. which rushed its cohorts to the spot
and erected a barricade set in concrete across
the road, omitting in its haste to inform the
public. The tramways people, having been
advised, hastily laid down a crossover to
enable its trams to get out of the cul-de-sac
thus suddenly created. During the follow-
ing night an irresponsible jester or an over-
zealous partisan made a well-planned effort
to burn down the object in dispute. Pos-
sibly because the word “barricade” used in
connection with the affair had a nasty sound
the Government woke out of its sleep, rushed
round to the Governor the very next day and
got an Order-in-Council requiring the bridge
to be opened, the idea being that regulated
traffic could still use it without danger of
being precipitated into the Yarra while the
repairs are being made at the State’s expense
and the tribunes of the people give their
minds to tlie question of what is to be done
in a permanent way. The Richmond Coun-
cil decided to ignore the ukase of the Gov-
ernment, leaving to it the responsibility of
demolishing the obstruction, which had been
further strengthened by an inner line of de-
fence across the middle of the bridge. Humor-
ous incidents similar to these have bright-
ened the monotony of life in other cities
whose affairs have been left overlong in the
hands of too many bumbles. Many efforts
have been made to federate the councils in
Melbourne, the most notable being due to
W. A. Watt when he was in State politics.
All were defeated by narrow sectional in-
terests, which found chaos preferable, be-
cause more profitable to themselves; and by
councillors jealous of any curtailment of
their dignities. If the newest incident leads
to a revival of interest in a Greater Mel-
bourne scheme it will have served its purpose.

The Reward of Boredom.
Sydney University is to grant a diploma in
journalism, and the courses of study are
now marked out. Graduates with first-class
honors, who have had not less than four
consecutive years of journalistic work under
conditions approved by the University, can
secure the new ornament by attending lec-
tures and passing examinations in
(1) The Principles and Practice of Journalism
(45 lectures).
(2) One of the following courses:—
The History of Journalism (45 lectures).
The Elemtente of Political Science (45 lectures—
if not already taken for a degree).
Those who hold an ordinary degree must
take an additional subject; and full courses
are prescribed for matriculated and un-
matriculated students. The central feature
of the whole scheme, however, is that a
short course in the Principles and Practice
of Journalism and another short course
in the History of Journalism are to
be added to the subjects already taught
at the University. The first of these
is a matter for discussion rather than
for dogmatism. The principles and prac-
tice of the art, game, profession or
whatever it may be called are as variable as
the minds directing the various newspapers
and periodicals. The rules of the game on
which leading journalists -would be in some-
thing like agreement would occupy no
greater space and take no longer to learn
than the rules of cricket or the axioms and
postulates of Euclid. No doubt a very dull
man could drone out hundreds of lectures
on such a subject; but a brilliant lecturer
who really knew his ground would be hard
put to it to fill in the time of a single lec-
ture with matter that counted. Yet under
the scheme men with four years’ experience
of practical newspaper office work are ex-
pected to endure 45 hours of long-drawn-out
platitudes about things which they under-
stand a great deal better than the lecturer
is likely to understand them. In the case
of the history of journalism the position may
be even worse. As a pleasant rambling
study it may be interesting enough to follow
the rise and development of the newspaper;
but the knowledge gained from a course of
lectures on the subject would be of little or
no value to the journalist. To read a small
text-book on such history—the kind of text-
book that could be run through in an even-
ing—would be quite as good as anything
that is likely to result from the University
course. Boiled down, the scheme amounts,
then, to no more than an undertaking by the
University to add two useless subjects to its
present list. The course for an ordinary
arts degree offers choice of subjects which
may be of great value to a journalist. Why
he should turn from such a course to seek
the barren honor of the proposed diploma
is a question to which it would be difficult
to find a decent answer. If such a diploma
is to be given at all why not give it in a
way that will appeal to the sense of journal-
ists and be in line with the nature of their
calling? Let men who have proved them-
selves for seven or ten years in newspaper
work write an original thesis on some defi-
nite subject and submit it to the University
in the manner in which theses for the degree
of Doctor of Divinity are submitted to the
older universities of Europe. Permission to
write such a thesis could first be obtained
from the University, which might settle its
choice of suitable candidates by consulta-
tion with editors and the Australian Journal-
ists’ Association. Such semi-honorary de-
grees would at least have the advantage of
being likely to be conferred on men of some
reputation: the diploma now proposed is
likely to be the barren reward of slow-
plodding, second-rate journalists with an in-
finite capacity for being bored.

The Rot in England.
“Bildad” : I suppose Francis Jackson,
author of “The Rot in England” (B.
18/2/’26), isn't much less sure of his facts
than the average, but then the average is low.
For instance, he supplies this news: —
France is making no great effort to pay her foreign
debt by direct taxation. Her credit is bad and her
currency depreciated, yet she is hard at work, has
no unemployed, and can produce more than enough
food for her own needs. She has remained essentially
agricultural, and is self-contained. England, on the
other hand, is industrial, the greater part of her
population is in overcrowded towns, and she is depen-
dent for her existence upon the importation of food.
These are the things that anybody thinks
he has heard somewhere. But taking the
“special trade” of the country (imports for
local use and exports of local products as
distinguished from transit trade) this is
how: —
France doesn’t “produce more than enough food
for her own needs.” In 1924 imports of “food pro-
ducts” exceeded exports by almost 5,000,000,000
francs. Deducting exports from imports the republic’s
local supply was over four million tons short of
local demands.
France’s biggest imports by far are raw materials
to keep her factories going—wool and the like. In
1924 imports of raw materials exceeded exports by
25,000,000 tons in weight and nearly 16,000,000,000
francs in money.
The biggest exports of France were, in 1924,
clothing, silk piece goods, cotton piece goods, pearls,
automobiles, iron and steel, wine (but, staggering
to relate, the imports of wine exceeded the exports),
rubber goods, chemicals, soaps and perfumes, in
that order. If these are the doings of a country
which is still struggling in the agricultural or raw
material stage, I wish Australia could struggle
similarly.
Even in England and Wales, by far the most
densely peopled part of the British, Isles, the greater
part of the population isn’t in “overcrowded cities.”
Most people say it is, so it can’t be. The “States-
man’s Year Book” is a fair authority, and its latest
estimate was that 39 per cent, of the population
lived in the country or in centres with less than
20,000 people, and 52 per cent, in the country or
in centres of less than 50,000 people.
England and Wale* are over three times more densely
peopled than France (649 people per square mile
against 185), yet the two countries have almost
exactly the same proportion of their area under culti-
vation, including artificial grass. The United King-
dom, as a whole, is much smaller than France, yet
beats it for sheep by 2 to 1. And there are other
unexpected comparisons which could be made.
One moral is that a country which is un-
doubtedly rich, as France is despite its shady
finance, doesn’t arrive at that condition by
remaining “essentially agricultural,” as Aus-
tralia’s importing sharks want Australia to
be. A second moral is that an industrious
and ingenious people, with sense enough to
acquire a robust Protectionist tariff of its
own, has no desire to try. France aims at
being self-supporting in. the matter of timber,
for fear of a world shortage, and its area is
about 20 per cent, forest, but it has no idea
of growing cheap food for anybody, and with
so many frontiers, including two seas, avail-
able for importing it doesn’t even care that
its own victual supply is short. But it is
so much interested in manufactures that it
imports wine in great quantities for use in
its factories. What is done with the wine
in the factories is another matter, but I fear
the worst.

Queensland’s Vanishing Factories.
The Queensland Labor Government is
anxiously casting about for a vote-catching
policy for the State elections. There are no
political issues in sight—none, at least, that
the Government would not prefer to see
buried. Yet a catchy policy must be found
somewhere: without it the Labor Govern-
ment is doomed. In this dilemma one of the
brighter minds of the Cabinet is planning a
policy of fostering secondary industries. He
knows that something more is needed to win
an election than his Premier’s pose as a
strong, silent man who says nothing and
does nothing, but is a beggar to think. Labor
has fostered industry in Queensland hitherto
by piling on taxation, raising the basic wage,
introducing the 44-hour week, loading indus-
try with the cost of unemployment insurance,
and subjecting manufacturers to the inquisi-
torial supervision of union officials and in-
dustrial inspectors. Under this “fostering”
treatment the output of Queensland factories
is falling, and costs are rising. The official
figures put the position in a nutshell: —
Total Value or Output.
1921 .. £40,334,298
1923 . . 38,867,603
Decrease.. £1,466,695
The value of raw material used decreased by
£2,698,368 in these two years. While Queens-
land was declining, every other State in
the Commonwealth was increasing its fac-
tory output. Here are the comparative fig-
ures for the same period (1921-22 to 1923-
24) :
Value of Factory Output.
N. S. Wales .. .. Increase £13,539,195
Victoria „ 7,678,746
S. Australia .. .. „ 5,796,138
Tasmania . . . . . . ~ 2,004,863
Westralia .. .. .. „ 684,571
Queensland . . .. Decrease 1,466,695
A fact worth noting is that while the output
of Queensland factories decreased, the num-
ber of hands employed increased by 2700,
salaries and wages increased by £547,156,
and the average output per employee de-
creased by £9O. The fostering care of the
Government, during 10 years of Labor rule,
has brought various Queensland industries to
a standstill; much more of it will drive the
surviving manufacturers into bankruptcy. All
that will be changed, perhaps, when the
Labor Government starts “fostering indus-
try” in earnest. It is hard to believe, but
perhaps the electors will allow themselves to
be persuaded. The first step, of course, will
be the creation of well-paid jobs for Labor
supporters. A Minister for Manufactures
may take his place by the side of the present
Minister for State Enterprises: a Bureau of
Manufactures and a Department of Manu-
factures will have to be organised, and a
Journal of Manufactures started to teach
manufacturers how to manufacture. By that
time the elections will be safely over, and
the new leopard will doubtless be found to
be the old leopard, after all.

The Revolt Against Purity.
Dear Bulletin, —The “Plain English” para-
graph which appeared lately under the head-
ing above, and which referred to the in-
creasing number of juvenile offenders
before the Courts, should draw attention to
a very real danger, namely, that in our ultra-
modern and very laudable desire to love the
sinner, we are liable to forget to hate the
sin. “Everyone,” it read, “will probably
have a suggested cause for the increasing
laxity.” This may be so ; nevertheless, any-
one who has an all-embracing cause to sug-
gest may be fairly sure of one thing at least,
that he is wrong. It is a common mistake
to trace all delinquency in the young to a
few all-powerful causes. One of the causes
oftenest mentioned is a “defective moral sense."
Whatever this mythical thing may be, it has
never yet caused an act of juvenile delin-
quency. No child has yet appeared who was
born good, neither has any child been born
bad. Every child is born neither moral nor
immoral, but simply without morals. None
the less, this search for a cause, wide of the
mark though it generally is, constitutes a
groping in the right direction. For punish-
ment or treatment, if it is to be remedial,
must fit, the causes and not the crime. I
say “causes” because there is in every case
of delinquency a multiplicity of them. And
in each case of delinquency the combination
of causes is unique, nor is any reformation
possible until at least the most important
threads of the tangled skein have been un-
ravelled. One of the causes may be defec-
tive discipline at home, discipline that is too
strict, or too lenient, or virtually non-
existent ; some one instinct may be over-
developed ; there may be general emotional
instability, or some degree of intellectual
defect, or some irritating physical defect;
perhaps there is a family history of vice or
crime, or some baleful complex is working
havoc. There may even be something wrong
with that hardy scapegoat, the movies. The
important point is not the suggestion of a
number of possible causes, but the discovery
of the actual combination of causes produc-
ing the particular case of delinquency.
America tries so many things that it must
occasionally “score a bull.” It has in this
matter, and the sooner we follow its example
of establishing a psychological clinic in con-
nection with our children’s courts, the nearer
we shall be to the solution of this problem
of juvenile delinquency. In connection with
such a clinic there should be a senior psy-
chologist. a man trained in analytic methods
and capable of unravelling the motives of the
abnormal mind. There should also be a
junior psychologist to do the routine testing,
for this is not a matter of rapid methods
and quick cures. The services of a competent
medical man should also be available.
These three, by the careful analysis
of cases of delinquency, and by recom-
mendations as to treatment, could not
only prevent serious mistakes or even dis-
asters in individual cases, but also effect an
economy for the country that would many
times exceed the cost of their appointment.—
Yours, etc., Sike.

A Foolish Old Mystery.
“Henry Horsecollar” : The public debt
of France has doubled since the peace, and
the amount which it owes to Britain is sec-
ond only to the unpaid bill of Russia. There
lias been no repudiation, as in the ease of the
truculent and bushranging Soviet, but in the
most recent year J. Bull collected nothing
from Gay Paree in reduction of principal
and about 6s. per £lOO on account of in-
terest, which is not regarded as satisfactory.
The French Budget has balanced once or
twice through leaving much interest unpaid
and by floating some internal loans and
printing more paper, though at the best the
balance has been precarious. The value of
the paper franc has sunk so far that the
last diver who went down in search returned
saying he had failed to locate a sign of it,
and if it ever is fished up it may be past
resuscitation. In the circumstances, Minis-
tries enter and exit very fast. Not that
a French Cabinet is a durable bit of furni-
ture at any time. Each one comes in to put
the finances straight, or at least to put them
straigliter, and it goes out either because
it proposed to reduce salaries, or to sack
some among the vast superfluity of civil
servants, or to put on more taxes, or to
collect with more energy those that are on,
or to do two or three or all of these things
at once. It has been estimated that more
than half the should-be income-tax payers
of the republic don’t pay, and that few of
the rest settle up in full. The latest finan-
cial improvement plan, issued at Christmas,
embodied these propositions :
A cutting down of expenditure by 800,000,000
francs, increase of the income-tax by, in eases, as
much ,as 200 per cent., and the pursuit of tax-
evaders with the vim, celerity and well-organised
efficiency of the Inquisition in its most wakeful days.
Said evadei - , when located, to be collected from, put
in a dungeon, and deprived of his vote and his
chance of sitting in Parliament.
The Left is the party said to be responsible
for these ideas. There is no reason to believe
that either the reform or the reform Govern-
ment has any lasting power. Still, some
points stand out. The French, as already
mentioned, have a reputation for being
elusive in the tax-paying line, and the in-
come tax is difficult to gather as compared
with customs, excise, land-tax, dog-tax, poll-
tax, house-tax, horse-tax, window-tax and
other imposts on visible things. The Aus-
tralian has no specially bad name for de-
frauding the revenue, yet among private in-
come-tax payers the leakage has been esti-
mated at anything between 20 and 40 per
cent., and some calculations go still higher.
Therefore, each man suspects his neighbor
of dishonesty, more or less, and the Depart-
ment suspects everybody. Either the British
calamity who invented income-tax in 1708, or
the British disaster who revived it in 1842, or
both, had stuffy and Podsnappish ideas about
an Englishman’s house being his castle, and
an Englishman’s income being his own dead
secret, and so an element of mystery was
wrapped around the matter which made
fraud easy and honesty almost superfluous.
It is possible that the French financier with
the great project of reform —the man whose
name is doubtless already Mun —proposed
to do away with the cloak of secrecy, and
there is really no reason why this shouldn’t
be done. The most naked publicity is given
to the amount of principal a citizen had at
death, and it is quite as interesting and
much more useful to know the amount of
interest he had during life. The pay of
civil servants. Judges, Ministers, bishops,
Governors and others is set forth in print

as a matter of eourse, and it would seem
no great hardship if information tending to
disclose the pay of private-citizen Smith was
made available also. The tradition of con-
cealment, as if an income was a dead body,
tends neither to private honesty nor
public revenue. Also it is out of keep-
ing with an age of short skirts and
almost-vanished bathing costumes. It seems
advisable that once each year there should
be published, in each township or electorate,
a list of the inhabitants who had paid or still
owed income-tax, and the amount dragged
(or dragable) from each. In addition, the
list should be glued up for reference, like
an honor roll, in the town hall or other
conspicuous place, and remain there till
superseded by next year’s document. Then
the news that Midas didn’t pay would spread
till it reached headquarters, which would
have been out in search of Midas a dozen
years earlier if it had been apprised of his
existence, and which would have been ap-
prised a dozen times over but for the absurd
tradition of silence and gloom. Having noted
the sudden arrival of a multitude of new
contributors, as a result of the new policy
of frankness and open dealing, the Depart-
ment could investigate their fraudulent pasts
at its leisure. The innovation would be
helpful to parents, guardians, creditors,
prospective creditors, seekers after know-
ledge for its own sake, and to the cause of
honesty, as well as to the public revenue.

The Black Cloud in S’Afriea.
“Der .Tong” : Most of the comments of
“Henry IIorsecollar” (B. 25/2/’26) on
my brief note on the possibility of a native
rising in S’Africa are either inaccurate or
irrelevant. He supposes, to begin with, that
the Dutch-Labor Pact is legislating against
the Kaffir’s access to the skilled trades. From
the days when the white first came to
S’Africa the Kaffir has been the artisan of
the community, as well as its laborer. For
a great many years he has monopolised many
of tlie skilled trades, because the European
would not engage in them. The white never
was lower on the scale than supervising fore-
man. Railway extension presently killed
teamster’s work; and the white ox-conduc-
tors, emigrant tradesmen and others became
a serious problem. Local caste cus-
tom prevented them engaging in manual
labor; indeed, no one would employ
them as working tradesmen. It is its
anxiety to find reputable employment for
these whites, otherwise unemployable, that
bas led the Government to seek to
close the skilled trades to the Kaffir, and
thus make them available for their own
people. “H.H.’s” inference that, because
Hertzog, the third Boer Prime Minister of
the Union in succession, favors the proposed
law, his more famous predecessors were in
agreement with him is a wrong one. Botha
long ago turned down the proposition, and
Smuts has bitterly opposed it since its re-
vival. My fear of a possible native rising, as
the result of the bill becoming law, is shared
by many prominent South Africans. In this
connection the recent re-organisation and
strengthening of the Afrikander Citizen
Forces may be only a coincidence. With a
white population of 1.500,000 of all ages scat-
tered among 5,000,000 blacks, such a rising
is always a possibility. Less than 20 years
ago, a small section of the Zulus rose in re-
bellion over a trivial incident, and much blood
and money were squandered before the affair
was suppressed. The other two great semi-
independent warrior tribes of the Union, the
Swazis and the Basutos, have also morn
than once had a shy at the white man; and
the great mass meetings lately of native
workers at Johannesburg, with their white
communist organisers, may be a hint of
worse to come.

The Case for the Shipmaster.
“Albatross” : There is industrial trouble
enough on the sea nowadays, but as yet it
has not extended seriously to masters and
officers. Nevertheless the writing is plain
on the wall for all men to read.
The extremists of the Walsii and Inch-
cape type have solidly and stubbornly
built barrier walls on the outer edges of the
sea-industry to bolster their personal interests
whilst masters and officers have been running
hopefully between them, oblivious of the fact
that they are headed for a hopeless cul-de-
sac. Having no professional status, though
they have to pass examinations which call
for a University education —and the exam-
inations are getting harder year by year—is it
any wonder officers look askance at the doings
of militant unionists and pettifogging ship-
owners? Certificated shipmasters are in-
dispensable, and from time immemorial the
adventurous skipper has made the ship-
owner possible. Having been an “owner’s
man” and done all the dirty work, with his
ticket in jeopardy times out of number, what
does he get? lie is pushed on the beach —
without provision in most cases—when the
owner considers he has outlived his useful-
ness. It takes seven years to make a
master-mariner, and the reward is not worth
the labor. A young officer, say, with a first-
mate’s papers, after serving six or seven
years with one company, comes ashore to
sit for his master’s ticket. What happens?
His pay stops during his two or three
months on shore whilst he is cramming for
the shipowner’s benefit, and when he has
attained the zenith of his desires—-to be
called “captain”-—he may find his job has
gone astray. The whole of the time he has
been sitting for his ticket he has had to
keep himself and his wife and family—if
any—and bear the brunt of loss of wages and
examination expenses. And the owners still
demand more. Some of them are making
it essential for officers to be skilled in wire-
less telegraphy to save the expense of opera-
tors on their ships. The Maoriland Govern-
ment has met certain shipowners half-way
on this point, and has even provided an
expert to coach officers on the subject. Offi-
cers are thus being coerced into doing other
men’s jobs. What is the remedy? To my
mind there is only one thing: to make a
shipmaster a real professional man by estab-
lishing chairs of Navigation and Astronomy
in our universities. The increased mathe-
matical curriculum in modern navigation calls
for it, and it would bring the shipmaster
into line with the civil engineer and barrister.
Only then would the heckled shipmaster
come into his own, and the spectacle of a
shipowner inspecting brass plates in search
of a likely master mariner to make his busi-
ness possible might become an accomplished
fact.

A strong wind from the north fanned the
busli-fires into a blaze again last week in
FAME.
“Australian artists are to be commissioned to paint portraits of the ration’s heroes for the art
gallery at Canberra.”
What to expect if the artists take their instructions literally.
Victoria. The rising town of Kinglake was
demolished, only the post-office, whence a
plucky postmistress kept up communication
with Melbourne, being missed. At Queens-
town, the hall, hotel, school and R.iC. church
went up. The Government put in operation
its tardily organised corps of fire-fighters,
who were conveyed by car from one threat-
ened place to another; they not only were
the means of saving life, but stopped the
enemy from getting into many valuable forest
areas. As soon as Australia realised the ex-
tent of the disaster relief began to pour into
Melbourne, and within a few days nearly
£lOO,OOO had been subscribed, while piles of
food and clothing accumulated at the rail-
way stations and the committees were
snowed under with offers of homes for
refugees. There w r as some delay in organis-
ing the distribution of this tangible good-
will ; but immediate necessities were soon
relieved, and the Government concentrated
on the re-establishment of industry by re-
building bridges, railways and mills'. A
matter which might have attention is the
burned forest itself. If the big trees in
the charred area are promptly felled the
timber will be usable; if left' standing, it
will soon be valueless.
The complaint voiced in a recent Bulletin
that the Vic. postal service was bound too
rigidly by red tape applied only to the days
before the fires became serious; when it was
seen that a public disaster was threatened
the tape was relaxed, and fine work was done
both inside and outside the regulations. There
was, for instance, the case of the postmistress
at Ferntree Gully who remained on prac-
tically continuous duty for two days and the
intervening night, and on her own initiative
summoned assistance and directed it to the
points threatened. The Department has
specially commended her; and it has made
a note also of valuable initiative shown and
good work done; by the officers at Ferny Greek,
Arthur’s Creek, Kinglake West and other
centres. The Department has necessarily to
prescribe hours of ordinary attendance and
fees chargeable; but it is human enough to
feel w T ell disposed towards those officers who
can tell when it becomes a public duty to
forget the rules made for ordinary circum-
stances.

“Centurion ’: Recently a sub-branch of
the R. 8. and 8. League refused to admit an
applicant for membership because he had
once served with the A.I.F. military police.
The matter was referreu to the State Execu-
tive, which side-stepped the question by
ruling that members of a sub-branch had
the sole right of admitting applicants for
membership at their discretion. It is a
dangerous precedent. Quite apart from the
merits or demerits of the military police, its
members were regularly-enlisted men of the
A.1.F., and most of them saw front-line
service before, during or after their connec-
tion with the Jacks. To blacklist men who
served w r ith an unpopular section of the
army, often being detailed for the job, is
perilously close to the ugliest feature of
modern industrialism - that which encour-
ages unionists not only to refuse to work
with men who have incurred their dis-
pleasure, but to deliberately close to them
every avenue to membership.

A sort of counterblast to Wembley, though
hung on a hook to which nobody can take
exception, is a big exhibition to be held at
Philadelphia this year under the title of
the Sesquicentennial International Exposi-
tion. The show is to be a “nation-wide
thanksgiving for spiritual and material joys
made possible by a century and a half of
freedom,” and the promoters, among them
a commission representing the Government,
place first importance on giving the- cause of
education the biggest lift it has ever had.
Most of the countries of the world will be
represented, including Britain and India —-
the latter’s exhibits will be housed in an
exact reproduction of the Taj Mahal. There
will be a Treasure Island five times as large
as the one at Wembley, a replica of High-
street, Philadelphia, as it was in 1776 when
the Declaration of Independence was signed,
a reconstruction of Solomon’s Temple, and
other ambitious and curious structures, and
Hank Coolidge will give patriotic orations
on July 3 and 4. It was just five years
after the American revolutionaries had made
their peace with Mother and one year after
they had made themselves a Constitution
that Captain Phillip stood up somewhere
near Sydney Cove and made all Australia
British soil by remarking that it was so.
Thus the loss of half of one continent was
balanced by putting the pegs in the whole
of another. Australian history might have
been very different had it not been for G.
Washington.

“Bill o’ Costs” : Among semi-legal customs
that die hard is the reading of conditions of
sale at auctions, especially land-sales. Of
course all that is needed is to give the pros-
pective buyer clear notice of the terms upon
which he bids, and in these days of printing
and typing it is as easy and convenient to run
off a few extra copies and post them con-
spicuously in the sale-room as it is to have
a clerk spend half an hour or more in
gabbling over a long screed to people who
don’t listen or fail to understand when they
do. In practice it usually means that the
auctioneer has to explain the matter again
to those who failed to get any sense out
of the torrent of words. Salesmen detest
the business and the delay it. involves, and
try to take short cuts, but lawyers shake
misgiving heads and insist upon their ancient
rite like a religion. Thinking there might
be some unsuspected wisdom in the practice,
I turned up that old standby of conveyancing
lawyers, Dart’s “Vendors and Purchasers”
(Ed. 1876), and read this: “The practice,
which still prevails in some parts of the
country, of having written conditions of sale
produced and read over, but not circulated,
in the auction-room, cannot be too strongly
reprobated, and if a purchaser is thereby
misled,” etc. So we in Australia are still
where Little Pifflington was in 1876!

The Dutch East Indies Government is
favorably considering the application of
W.A. Airways, Ltd., for facilities for a
weekly mail and passenger service via the
atmosphere that lies between the Sunset
State and Java. Bima, a small island
notable for the breeding of ratlike but sturdy
ponies, is to be the stepping-stone. It lies
half-way along the island chain that links
Asia with the Northern Territory, and the
jump thence to Broome or Derby should
prove sufficiently safe to make the air jour-
ney attractive to many people. The initia-
tive taken by Groperland is an illustration
of the geographical fact that the real gate-
way to the “East” is on the west. Already
travellers from Singapore are finding the
nor’-west coast and the Trans, railway the
quickest route to eastern Australia, and a
very old tendency of Anglo-Indians to send
their offspring to the equable climate of Perth
instead of to the Cold Land is to be fostered
by a college for white children from Asia.

Queensland leads the other States in the
control of commission agents. Every auc-
tioneer and every kind of business agent has
to be licensed. If he carries on business
without a license, or pretends that he is
licensed when he isn’t, he is liable to heavy
penalties. Before he can obtain a license he
must satisfy the Court that he is a person
of good repute, and he must put up either
a cash deposit of £5OO or a fidelity bond for
that amount. Many applications for bonds
are refused, as the Insurance Commissioner
naturally takes steps to satisfy himself that
the applicant is a reasonably safe risk. Even
when the agent has got his license he is not
out of the wood, as he is under the control
of the Registrar, who investigates all com-
plaints of sharp practices or breaches of the
Act. Licenses have to be renewed every
year, and this gives the Registrar an oppor-
tunity to clear out the undesirables. Only
a week or two ago the Registrar opposed a
renewal on the grounds that the holder was
a professional bondsman and the associate
of criminals. The Court refused the license.
If an agent is convicted of misappropriating
trust moneys his license is automatically can-
celled. and his cash deposit or bond is applied
to paying the claims of his creditors. Four
such cases are on record. In two of them
the bond more than covered the defalcations,
and creditors were paid 20s. in the £; in the
other cases the dividends were respectively
17s. 9d. and 16s. 3d. In other States the
creditors would have lost the lot when the
agents bolted.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Eden-Monaro by-election looks a good
thing for J. A. Perkins, who represented
Goulburn in the N.S.W. Assembly for five
years and headed the poll on May 31. Austin
Chapman’s last majority was over 10,000,
and there is no case on record where a
10,000 majority has been overturned in three
or four months, although Chapman got votes
which Perkins may lose. Morgan, the Labor
candidate, is painfully green. The Labor
Daily reported him as saying that the vic-
tery of the Bruce-Page Government “marked
the introduction of Tammanyism into Aus-
tralia.” A Sydney Labor alderman and the
Amalgamated Union of Impersonators and
Sliding-Panel Artists are laughing yet.
For saying what he thought of the com-
munist gang which has been doing its darn-
edest to ruin his State and destroy its in-
stitutions, as well as those of the Common-
wealth, Ogden, the Tas. Labor Senator, has
been expelled by the Speck Labor Confer-
ence. The voting was 28 to 21, which indi-
cates that a large proportion of the dele-
gates, and probably a majority of Tas. union-
ists, are of the same mind as Ogden. Also,
he won’t have to go up for re-election till
1928, and by that time the “movement” may
have become sane again. In 1922 he was
the only Tas. Labor candidate for the Senate,
none of his present enemies being game to
take on what they thought a forlorn hope;
nevertheless, he was the first Senator
elected, although every worker who gave him
No. 1 had to distribute two votes among
Nationalist opponents. A man with such
a record can afford to laugh at the bigots
who expelled him.
“I intend to let the world know that I am
a man who will not take money from any-
one,” said N.S.W. Premier Lang proudly.
The railway men who struck in 1917, and
whom Lang recently promoted (reducing or
discharging non-strikers to make room for
them), had proposed, in their gratitude, to
give the Premier a bonus; and as he sees he
can’t take the money, he wants to make
something out of not taking it. He will be
disappointed, for “the world” will manifest
no more interest in a Premier who is said
not to have accepted money than in a curate
who is alleged not to have committed mur-
der.
The newest hold-up of coastal ships in
N. S. Wales is over the question of handling
cargo at ports where there is so little doing
that the wharf-lumping class doesn’t exist.
According to the standing agreement the sea-
men take this as part of the day’s work, but
the scrap of paper lias been torn up and a
demand made for wharf-laborers’ pay. This
is high because of the time lost between jobs,
and Tom Walsh’s men, with constant employ-
ment, ask to be paid for the time they don’t
lose. It is a fair thing to give the useful odd-
jobber 2s. for five minutes’ work shifting one’s
luggage, but people who realise that wouldn’t
therefore consider it necessary to offer the
same or another man £57 12s. for a steady
48-hours-per-wcek billet, and that is just the
matter at issue.
The gentle Mr. Badly, N.S.W. Minister
for Stopwork and Lack of Industry, tendered
his mediation over the Mort’s Dock trouble.
The difficulty began when some employees
refused to observe their award any longer,
and demanded “concessions” which the co.
reckoned it couldn’t afford. It scrapes up
only 5 per cent, dividends, so there is no
great margin. Labor Minister Badly wanted
to know if there was no way to end the
work-stoppage apart from the simple one
of the unions keeping their promise. He
suggested that a delegation should be
appointed by each party, and that they should
select a third party as chairman, to be the
deciding factor. If the delegations couldn’t
agree, then Minister Badly was to act —or
his nominee. His decision was to be final
-—as against the company, of course, but not
against the unions. The refusal of this offer
is said to have shaken Minister Badly’s
faith in human nature.
THE OPIUM EATER.
“In spite of the enormous unemployment in Britain and the numerous funds and societies for the
encouragement of emigration to the Dominions, so powerful is the lure of the dole that only 38,666
migrants in excess of those returning left Britain for Canada last year, 35,006 for Australia, and
11,730 for Maoriland. The figures in 1911 were 134,765, 56,337 and 9432.”
JOHN BULL : “Come, my boy, a nice sum of money in your pocket to give you a start,
and the prospect of a free, active life in the open spaces !”
THE ONE: “I don’t want an active life. I want dope, dope, dope!”
Labor likes to pick and choose its man-
dates. If Lang has one for the abolition of
the Upper House, he also has one for the
creation of a Greater Sydney. Yet the city
Labor aldermen voted solidly against a recent
proposal that the Government should go
ahead with the reform. The fact is gerry-
mandering is easy under the present plan
for the piecemeal absorption of municipali-
ties like Glebe and Waterloo; and Labor
doesn’t care tuppence for its mandates when
they are weighed against such advantages as
that.
There are evidently going to be changes in
the N.S.W. Government railway refresh-
ment rooms. This branch is one of the few
Government trading departments that have
justified their existence. It has catered well
for the travelling public, and produced regu-
lar profits, whereas 98 p.c. of other experi-
ments in State socialism have shown chronic
losses. But a deputation of waitresses re-
cently rushed to the Minister with a com-
plaint that the management were “tyrants
and despots of the deepest dye,” and the
Ministerial worm returned “a sympathetic
reply.” Also the principal tyrant has mor-
tally offended Premier Lang by putting up
his very moderate charges and mentioning
that the increases were forced on him by the
44-hour week, which makes hash of Lang’s
assurance that the 44-hour week would not
affect the cost of living. So friends of Labor
politicians are getting ready to snavel the
manager’s job and those of the other tyrants
and despots complained of.
The Labor majority in Sydney City Coun-
cil has resolved that appointment to munici-
pal billets is to depend, not on examination
or any such nonsense as proof of merit, but
on the recommendation of an alderman.
This, of course, means a Labor alderman,
for no others count. If by any chance there
are venal aldermen —well, the award rates
should be printed to prevent low-priced com-
petition among them.
A. J. McLachlan, of South Aus., is now
two Senators, so to speak. His elected term
does not begin till June, and, as the vacancy
caused by Benny’s resignation runs only till
then, he was appointed to that also at a
joint meeting of the two S.A. Houses. Pre-
mier Gunn, making a virtue of necessity, said
that the Labor party recognised the seat as
belonging to the Liberals and thought they
might have paid Labor a similar compliment
when J. V. O’Loghlin died. It didn’t occur
to him to mention what happened in Queens-
land when John Adamson’s seat had to be
filled.
They do some of their deporting differently
in Maoriland. When some small boys
raided a postal-van recently at Dunedin
they left the stolen, papers strewn about the
countryside. A lynx-eyed policeman on re-
covering the spoils noted that a quantity
of it was prohibited literature, which re-
sulted in the appearance in court of Kenneth
McLean Baxter, who was charged with hav-
ing forbidden books in his possession. The
accused stated he had been receiving the
stuff as an agent of the Communistic party,
and though the party was disbanded the
literature still persisted. Baxter having
made the usual promise to leave for fresh
fields —probably Australia —sentence was
suspended.
The new policy of General Motors in
shipping its cars to Maoriland in cases of
parts and assembling them after arrival has
stirred up the local body-builders to strong
protest. Their industry has some Protection,
but this is nullified to a great extent by the
refusal of Amurrican firms to ship bare
cliasses. Now that bodies, too, come in
parts and arc likely to escape duty, the
Protection becomes but a shadow. Whereas
in Australia it is imperative to import one
chassis for every three complete cars, in M.L.
the proportion is about ten complete cars to
one chassis, Downie Stewart, the M.L. Cus-
toms Minister, says with a shudder that the
Australian law means prohibition, a thing
he can’t stand. If he spent an hour in a
Sydney street he would see there wasn’t
much prohibition about it.
Among the Communists it is always set
forth as a self-evident proposition that their
pet land of Russia is a grievous sufferer
from “economic blockade” and “commercial
boycott.” Actually John Bull, whom one
almost yearns to call John Fool for a change,
has lately been trading with his friend on
this basis: —
Britain Bought Russia Bought
‘from Russia from Britain
1921 .. .. £2,695,000 £2,181,000
1922 .. . . 8,176,000 3,679,000
1923 . . . . 9,308,232 4,483,383
1924 .. . . 19,994,000 3,820,000
If .T. Bull had a Protectionist tariff to bar-
gain with he might demand more level
trading. As it is he has got to the
point of paying the Soviet country over
£16,000,000 per annum to square the
trade account, and it seems to buy goods
from the United States with the money. Even
Australia buys and sells with the big robber
now, though there is little chance to do
business. The last available year's record
was that he sold us £33,556 worth, bought
£46 worth, and took the difference in cash.
The S.A. Labor Government has been
baited into appointing a Royal Commission
to look into the much-discussed release of
sundry convicts by the Gunn Ministry. Kings-
ley Paine, a special magistrate, is to be
the Commission. In other States desperate
criminals still make sporadic attempts to
break out of gaol. These efforts have ceased
in South Aus., it being now the custom to
enlist the friendly interest of a soft-hearted
Labor M.L.A.
The Commonwealth Shipping Line has got
rid of 43 vessels, all at a big loss, and of the
remaining 16 some (probably the majority)
are for sale. The poorest part of the joke
is that a number of “E”-elass cargo
craft (how many doesn’t appear) which
cost £2,633,162 went for £380,500, a
depreciation of 85 pei; cent. The first
of this species was launched at Cockatoo
on March 29, 1920, and the last at Adelaide
on November 4, 1922, so the trouble wasn’t
old age.
Opportunely Vic. Ministry discovered legal
difficulties in the way of permitting applica-
tions to be made by the Railway Commis-
sioners for a hotel license at Mount Buffalo
chalet, and by the Electricity Commissioners
for a bar at Yallourn. A K.C. advised that.
Clapp was not empowered by any Railway
Act to hold a license at the mount. If it
had been a railway terminus things might
have been different. There was a reason-
able case for the Electricity Commission, but
the Government thought Parliament had
better have a say first. As Cold Tea was
boiling with rage, and two Melbourne dailies
were thundering against the Buffalo proposi-
tion, the weak-kneed crowd in office was glad
of a legal smoke-screen to cover its retreat.
The aspersions that buzz around State
enterprise where up-to-date Labor runs the
show are plentiful as flies. Queensland Oppo-
sition-leader Moore recently declared that the
Mungana copper leases lapsed, and the Gov-
ernment could have had them for nothing,
but, instead, allowed them to be taken up by
“an individual” who sold them to the suffer-
ing country for £40,000. Moore’s suggestion
that inquiry might be useful evoked nothing
definite. When the Labor convention met
the A.R.U. delegates tabled a motion that
all papers concerning the purchase should be
produced ; but it was found that their creden-
tials were out of order or something, and
they were run off the premises.
An up-to-date prelate, the Bishop of Birm-
ingham, lately broke away from parsonical
precedent by saying that too much effort is
made to preserve, cultivate and patch tin 1
unfit so that they may be the parents of
new misfits. It is not a question of killing
off persons of low intelligence; but as mental
defectives have the habit of supplying a
crowded world with 50 per cent, more children
than intellectuals furnish, it seems time to dis-
qualify bad specimens of humanity from
reproduction. The law used to hang many
of this type by mistake for ordinary crim-
inals, but this check, which was stupid but
useful, has practically ceased to operate, and
it is now almost possible to get a Parliament-
ary majority of arrested intelligences. The
Bishop’s words aroused controversy in Syd-
ney. among other places. One result was
that the “Assistant-secretary, Freetrade and
Land Values League,” w r rote to the Tele-
graph, offering Henry-Georgeism as a cure
for the trouble. This should prove some-
thing—it might be rude to suggest what.

THE HERESY HUNTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“They ought to be shot, those scabs.’’ — McGirr,
M.L.C.
“The A.L.P. is demanding explanations from Messrs.
Kelly, Lyons, Akhurst, Smith and Murray for their
failure to attend the fateful division.”
“The Tasmanian Labor Conference decided on the
expulsion of Senator Ogden by 28 votes to 21.”
When things go not as they oughter, and you’re
plugged ’twixt wind and water
(Oh, the cunning of Carruthers! Oh, the bitter
cup for Lang !) ;
When you’re downed in a collision and the heathen
snort derision
(Oh, the cursed exultation of the Nationalist
gang!),
Somebody to bellow shame on—somebody to put the
blame on—
Someone to denounce for treachery and flay for
monkey tricks
Is the surely consequential, obviously first essential. ..
Comrades, let’s forget our troubles while we hunt
the heretics.
When you’re feeling just as rotten as a pug. who’s
stopped a hot ’un
(Oh, the gibes that sting and rankle Bavin’s acid
tongue lets loose !)
When the lamb you meant for dinner knocks the
slaughterman a spinner
(Oh, the Communistic bogeys in the window dressed
by Bruce!),
There’s vicarious satisfaction promising in any action
Like the unsuccessful sportsman’s who his dog in
dudgeon kicks;
Though the outlook dark and drear is, there’s one
sp<t>rt that never wearies—
Let us purge the movement, brothers, come and
hunt for heretics.
Swear them in, the Inquisition—eyes agleam with
dour suspicion.
(Oh, for saintly Torquemada’s burning faith and
zeal intense!)
Is it oiled, the rack that stretches quivering limbs
of groaning wretches?
(Oh, the Nemesis awaiting renegades like Catts
and Spence!)
Scapegoats there must be in plenty—some among the
five-and-twenty
Who the newest golden passes on their manly
breasts affix.
Now that Lang has come a cropper, search for such
is right and proper.
Tried and trusty camerados, come and hunt the
heretics.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The Capital Cities and Country Finan-
cial Institutions is an ambitious scheme
to create three distinct organisations with a
nominal capital of 64 millions under one
management and control •'which will com-
bine commercial banking, fiduciary, under-
writing, investment and other functions and
services.” The three concerns are to be a
bank, an underwriting co., and a mortgage
and finance co. Directors are ex-Speaker
Elliot Johnson, P. R. Higgins (barrister),
A. C. Willis (formerly manager, London
Bank, Sydney) and R. H. Crossing, grazier.
This from the prospectus concerns the
banking venture :• —-
To operate as a commercial bank modelled on the
lines of the most advanced banking ideas in successful
practical operation.... The directors hope to retain
and increase the confidence of the Australian public
by inaugurating a free approach to the bank’s officers,
operating departments without red-tape and creating
an efficiency which will mean quick, accurate service,
combined with care and safety in operation.
That may be taken as an implication that
the public will get something it cannot get
from the existing hanks ; and that isn’t likely
to be true. Procedure in all details may not
be perfect, but the trading banks have the
“confidence,” “accurate service” and “care
and safety in operation” of which the pros-
pectus speaks, in a measure equal to the
world’s greatest. Certainly there has been
a tendency to give more attention to city
bricks and mortar than to primary and
secondary industries; but that has been
changing, and in any case the intention behind
it was good for investors and depositors.
That there is always room for more effi-
ciency is ’as true of banking as of all other
businesses. Experience and invention almost
daily supply time- and labor-saving plans
and devices; but this is a minor matter and
not a vital issue. It is intended to create
a Trust Department. The aim is good.
Several new trustee cos. have been formed
in Australia of recent years, and the only
visible effect lias been to increase the
amount of trusts —which is a favorable sign.
But the history of the trust cos. has, in
the main, been one of slow progress. The
profits quoted as made by existing concerns
must be read with that in mind.
“That commercial banking is profitable,”
says the prospectus, “especially to original
buyers of shares, is conclusively proved”—
by the quotation of the figures of the leading
hanks. Those figures, however, don’t mean
much unless it can be guaranteed that new
hanks will pass through similar conditions.
Most of the banks, for instance, reaped a
harvest out of the war. The point really
is, then: What are the banks making now?
Take three quoted by the prospectus: Bank
of N.S.W., Commercial of Sydney and the
Australasia, The Wales pays 10 p.c. divs.
(it was insisted that last year’s 24 p.c.
extra was a bonus). Its disclosed profits
for 1925 were equal to 16 p.c. on paid capi-
tal. But £4,530,755 of visible reserves were
helping capital, plus the internal resources.
Perhaps the Wales earned 8 p.c. on its own
funds, visible and invisible. And it had a
century-old organisation and connection to
help it. The Commercial of Sydney paid
10 p.c. It had almost three millions of re-
serves visibly helping £3,500,000 of capital,
plus its inner reserves. Its profits last year
were less than 14 p.c. on paid capital, but
the return on its total funds was probably
about half that. The Australasia pays 13
p.c. p.a. Its hidden reserves are very heavy:
it has probably a million or more in pre-
mises alone, these appearing in the accounts
at £47,351. It is much to be doubted
whether its earnings on its own money
reached 7 p.c. The Primary Producers’
Bank, floated in 1923 (the first private ven-
ture since the ’nineties), has been favored
with excellent seasons, and the advantage of
£1 premium on the £1 called on the £5
shares wherewith it defrays establishment
charges. On present indications sharehold-
ers have poor prospect of early divs.. and even
then a modest 7 p.c. is all that is aimed
at. The fact that this new concern has to
keep most of its funds liquid limits its profit-
earning capacity.
The underwriting co. has as its object:—
To assist general development by making private
funds available through the use of modern methods
to those communities, firms and individuals who desire
to carry out public and semi-public utilities or
improvements or extensions to their business, with
increased return to lender or investor, satisfactory
terms to borrower or user, and reasonable compen-
sation to the “Underwriters. - ’
Broadly speaking, the idea is to loosen some
of the more or less frozen credit by buying
up whole issues of new cos. or going con-
cerns, to issue bonds against mortgages, and
retail to the general public, creating an
organisation for this purpose on the lines
of the bond-selling houses of America. In
this scheme there is much to be commended.
Australia needs a strong underwriting, office.
Millions are in the Savings Banks or on
fixed deposit. While this money does not re-
main idle, much of it could certainly be made
more productive. But the success of this arm
of the triple alliance would depend almost
entirely on judgment and management.
The mortgage and finance concern pro-
poses to give special consideration to the
secondary producer, and to obtain English
capital for investment in “sound Australian
development proposals.” Here is an avenue
offering business, but to go beyond present
usage carries with it risk.
Shares are to be in the following form :
Bank, £5, £2 called up, plus premium of 10s.
Underwriters, £l, Bs. called up, plus 2s. pre-
mium. Investment, Mortgage and Finance,
10s., 4s. called up, plus Is. premium. Appli-
cants must take equal shares in all three
ventures, and the trio will go to allotment
when 7500 in each have been applied for.
The premium is an excellent idea for the
companies; whether for the investor is left
to the future to determine. The directors’
remuneration is fixed in the case of each co.
at £204 for chairman and £156 p.a. for each
director. The directors hold office for three
years. J. H. Saunders, organising secretary
of the co., who has a three years’ engagement,
is to receive an over-riding commission of

The weather was not so kind as in the
previous 12 months, and wool prices had
fallen. So profits came back £27,000. When
the rain falls right, and the blowfly and the
rabbit and the wild dog behave themselves,
and the markets are strong, the co.’s returns
simply race up. The combination of good
things occurred in 1924; it may be years
before it occurs again. Last year the rain
was above the average, but four-fifths of
it tumbled down in one month. And the
wild dogs made up for their earlier forbear-
ance. More sheep were shorn; the clip of
2257 bales was 243 bales greater. But the
return was much less: £60,611 from wool
compared with £86,818 for 1924 ; live stock.
£14,786 compared with £19,237. Other re-
ceipts totalled £3297 as against £4748 (in-
cluding £3617 Bawra repayment) in 1924.
Moreover, working exes, were greater, al-
though other outgoings (including deprecia-
tion, £6880) were at about the old levels.
More lambs were marked, so the co. has a
fair start in the present year, particularly
as recent rains promoted good growth over the
1018 square miles comprised in Bundaleer
and Tliurulgoona. At December 31 the sheep
on the runs totalled 79,809, almost 5000 more
than at the previous count.
Last year’s 20 p.c. is not so opulent as
it looks, nor was the 30 p.c. of 1924, be-
cause part has to be regarded as return
of capital. Of the distributions from 1912
to 1923 17s. was so counted, and more than
half of the 1924 return (ss. of the 95.) was
called bonus. One-third of last year’s lot
carries the same label. In 1924 the co.
wrote off the uncalled 10s. on its £3 10s.
shares (paid to £3), reduced capital by half
(the shares were altered to 305.) and made
adjustment by writing the amount (£146,002)
off the book value of the leases. Apart from
those movements, the only material change
over the period shown hereunder was the
expansion of cash in 1924
1923. 1924. 1925.

No credit is taken in the accounts for the
holding of 8038 Bawra shares; and at aver-
age market price of 11s. 6d. there is a fair
reserve in that. Also, the co. hasn’t been
flattering to its 79,809 sheep and 400 horses
and cattle by placing their book value at
£47,218. However, optimism as to stock
values does not pay in dry, pest-ridden south-
west Queensland, even though, as at present,
feed is in sight for a good way ahead. Share-
holders have not had much out of the propo-
sition; divs. have been poor and shareholders
have not had the full amount of capital
written off. The leases expire in nine years,
and there is on certainty about renewal. If they
are not renewed, the co. would, of course, have
tenant rights in the improvements, what-
ever that might be worth. Those circum-
stances govern the view to be taken of the
present position. At December 31 liquid
assets and livestock had a book value of
£146,939, which, allowing for liabilities, was
equal to 28s. 2d. for each 80s. share. And
there were the stations, plant and stores and
improvements in the books at £71,984. At
the moment the outlook is bright enough.
The runs are well stocked, and wool prices
seem fairly stable at profitable levels. The
rest depends chiefly on the weather, and the
Wild Cat has forgotten to renew its prophet’s
license.

When Greater J. D. Williams was saved
from what appeared to be certain wreck by
the timely launching of the picture combine,
its goodwill of £63,700 was displaced by
‘‘shares in Australasian Films and Union
Theatres, £195,000,” mostly water, of course.
For years profits were meagre, notwithstand-
ing that Australasian Films and Union
Theatres had a strong grip of the hiring and
showing, and were in a position to keep the
pick of the business for themselves. Over
the whole period big profits must have been
made in the Australian picture-handling and
exhibiting business, but tlioy did not get into
Australian pockets. lloweve - . expansion and
the possession of good positions have been
bringing in bigger returns, and competition
is minimised, so that Greater .T. D. Williams
(West’s, Spencer’s and Taits’ are the other
partners in the combine) should get improved
returns from its holdings.
Besides “shares in other cos.” Greater
Williams’s assets are :
1923. 1924. 1925.
Freeholds, leaseholds .. £34,442 £34,442 £34,442
Advances to Gombine cos. 32,315 40,986 32,551

Cash, book debts .. 5,077 3,810 11,838
£74,288 £82,344 £81,591
The £9750 in divs. received during the year,
as against £14,337 in 1924, represented an
exact 5 p.c. on the Combine shares, but less
than 5 p.c. on total share holdings (£4500
is in “other cos.”). ,The freeholds and lease-
holds are let wholly or mostly to the Com-
bine, and produced a net rental of £11.559 ;
the debentures, etc., produced another £2BlO,
making (with the £9750 of dividends) a total
income of £24,119. But against that there
is to he charged interest, depreciation, re-
pairs, rates and taxes, salaries, etc, £6407.
The leaseholds are being amortised ; they now
stand at only £1227. (Freeholds—the Melba
Theatre —are in at cost, £33,215.) Liabili-
ties have not been reduced of late, but show
a fair reduction compared with the figure
of eight years ago:—
1917. 1924. 1925.
Mortgage .. .. £28,000 £lB,OOO £lB,OOO

Sundry creditors .. 1,904 1,427 1,400
£34,704 £24,227 £24,200
There has been a reduction of outgoings from
£7156 to £6407 in the last 12 months; but
the bundle is so miscellaneous that the shrink-
age may not mean much. Still, apart from
that, there are hopeful features, even allow-
ing that amusement enterprises are uncer-
tain cattle at the best.

There isn’t much in dry-goods. Mitchell’s
is an old-established business; it has a turn-
over probably well beyond the million mark;
its balance-sheet is free of intangibles; its
fixed assets are in the books at considerably
less than their value. And the best it could
do in one of the most prosperous and loan-
augmented years in Australia’s recent history
was a profit equal to a fraction over 6 p.c.
on its paid capital of £225,000. It may not
have done even as well as that, for out of
tin? unappropriated balance lias to come a
staff bonus and provision for taxation. These
render an exact calculation of reserves im-
possible, but that matter is righted in the
following year It is pretty plain, however,
ttiat business did not look up much if at all:

1925 •• •• 119,740 100,563
Expenses were cut back, which helped a
little. However, competition is very keen
in practically all of the products handled by
the co., and no less so in the lines which it
packs or manufactures itself. The factory
s |do of the business is in the hands of a sub-
sidiary in which the parent holds all the
shares. There is little prospect of relief from
the keen competition. Apart from the big
rivals, smaller concerns keep coming and go-
ing, and in their (generally) brief existence
they tight desperately for business at cut
rates.
Here is so much ofl the progress as is dis-
closed by the balance-sheet figures since
1920:
T . , 1920, 1923. 1924. 1925.

Cash, etc. .. 8,770 11,509 11,549 14,765
A minimum of information is given there for
trade rivals, though the figures sprinkled
through this review certainly could not be
taken as encouragement by newcomers.
Nevertheless the co.’s position is quite solid:
its experience during the slump is one proof
of that. Sundry creditors loom large, but
that entry combines all fixed and floating debt
and probably something in the way of con-
tingency reserves. Investments are grouped
with book debts. The prosperity in the coun-
try last year should have resulted in wide-
spread liquidation of store accounts, and
the storekeepers should have passed the
money into the city wholesalers who in turn
were carrying them. Maybe this happened,
and the investments part was increased. No-
thing can be said as to that. In any case
liabilities at December 31 were well covered
by liquid and semi-liquid assets totalling
£402,521. The public has been interested
since 1913. It has had only moderate re-
turns on its capital, and on present indica-
tions it would do well not to expect more.

J. C. Ludowiei and Son paid their usual
30 p.c., which means that shareholders arc
not so well off as they were a few years
ago, when £lO would buy a good deal more
than, it can to-day. Still, the year showed
better results than any since the post-war
boom; and as the profits shown then were
in many cases fictitious, that period hardly
counts for purposes of comparison. There
is, of course, a doubt whether the present
ought to count either, because the prodigious
public borrowing, which inflates prices and
profits, can’t continue indefinitely. Sensing
something of the sort, wise directorates are
providing where they can for a reaction;
and in this case it is possible that, besides
the £9OO visibly added to reserves, something
may have been slipped away before the net
profit was written in. When the leather
market fell to pieces after the war no cut in
stock values was visible in the accounts,
which supported a long-held suspicion that
when the management adds its stock figures
it makes four plus four equal seven. Here
is a comparison of balance-sheet figures:—
1918. 1923. 1924. 1925.

Freeholds were £BO6l less at £50,576. Dur-
ing the term portion of one of the suburban
properties was sold; this allowed the co.
to carry more stocks and book debts with-
out unduly swelling the outside debt. Ex-
port demand was good, and chairman F. J.
Ludowiei is off to England to see if lie can
make it better, and at the same time find out
whether the co. has anything to learn from
overseas manufacturers.

from Greymouth. Boring proved the seam
at 293 ft. to be llAft. thick; at 1313 ft. there
was 21ft. Experts’ opinions are that 369-
odd acres are coal-bearing, and from four
to five million tons extractable. During the
year the main drive and the return aiiway
were completed, so development should now
be more rapid. Shareholders were told at
the annual meeting that the co. has already
established a market, but this is on a pro-
duction of only 80 tons per day. By April
it is hoped to have plant and working
places sufficiently advanced to ensure
250 tons per day, increasing to 450 tons by
September 30. The colliery is to be equipped
with modern electrical machinery; although
the aim is 100,000 tons p.a. the equipment
now going in is capable of getting out almost
twice the quantity. Paid capital is £33,985,
which will be increased to £58,040 as soon
as the vendors’ shares have been allotted.
Everything defends on markets. The coal
is of good quality and the directors are con-
fident that there will be no difficulty as to
orders.

Alan Davis is marketing Stannifcr Lode
Tin Co. (N.S.W.) in 50.000 ss. shares, of
which 30,000 are contribs. The vendor’s
20,000 are in two classes, 6000 being fully-
paid and 14,000 paid to 4s. 6d. There is
also a cash consideration of £5OO. The 20-
acre lease is at Stannifer, 12 miles from
Inverell. The only report on the area is
by J. W. Archibald, who found a 52ft. shaft
from the bottom of which a crosscut exposes
15ft. of ore, which should give 5000 tons
of 2 p.c. oxide without allowing for further
developments. A drive 40ft. north from the
crosscut on the hanging-wall side of the
lode has not reached its end; nor has a
south drive on the footwall side for 60ft.,
albeit another crosscut here at again
exposed 15ft. of ore. Two parcels of 50 tons
each from the dump have gone just under 2
p.c. at Newstead mill, and Archibald thinks
that holders should get their money back
from the first year’s work. In this regard
he naturally makes the reservation that the
management must be sound, doubtless having
in mind the many shows killed by slipshod
methods.

A serious movement of ground on the
northern boundary of the B. H. Junction
North between the 1100 ft. and 1200 ft. levels
began early last week. The stopes in the
area collapsed, and, on the instructions of
the Inspector of Mines, the men were with-
drawn. The North was affected, but only to
a very small extent. Late in the week partial
resumption of stoping in the Junction North
was approved.

Stackpool’s. Crystal, the little Melbourne
co. operating at Ardlethan (N.S.W.), at
February 25 showed accumulated debit re-
duced to £9096. Unfortunately, sales of tin
concentrates, though aggregating £4424
against £472 for the previous year, were
not large enough to prevent £1172 being
dredged from the pockets of shareholders in
calls. Prospecting hitherto has been con-
fined to the northern portion of the property,
from which 610 tons for the year gave 381
tons concentrates. This over 6 p.c. stuff would
be O.K. if it were much more plentiful. The
policy now is to drive south towards the
Carpathia in the hope of intercepting some-
thing that way. There is £19,694 of paid-up
capital, and creditors claim £lll, but the
co. has £2924 in the till.

Ajana Lead Mines, Ltd., formed some
years ago by the late Dorrie Doolette and
a few Melbourne and Sydney friends to take
over a show on the Northampton field
(W.A.), has sold out to the Surprise Co.
The latter works the adjoining block, and is
backed by the State Government.

Westralia’s latest “gold-find” proved a dud.
Every dish prospect was colorless, and, on
leaving, disappointed diggers charcoaled on
the buck quartz some pointed and candid
remarks about the discoverer. An effigy was
also left hanging from the limb of a tree.
A fair amount of boost was printed in the
newspapers about the importance of the
“find,” so the public was fortunate that it
was not bitten.

Boulder Perseverance’s reduced profits for
last year are attributed by the Board to the
large decrease in the tonnage of ore mined,
to the diminished grade, and to the fact that
production was much slower than anticipated.
The absence of the gold premium which for
years materially helped to swell the co.’s
bank-balance was also sorely felt. The man-
ager states that there is much ground still
to be explored and developed, and that, gene-
rally, prospects justify the continuation of
vigorous development.

Portion of the Commonwealth's grant of
£450,000 to Westralia is to be used for pen-
sions under the recently-passed Miners’
Phthisis Act. This Act provides for the pay-
ment of £2 a week to tubercular miners who
are compelled by law to give up their jobs,
until such time as suitable other employment
can be found for them, or, if declared unfit
for work, until death. In the case of mar-
ried men extra money is provided for wives
and children, but the total amount paid to
a married man and his dependants must not
exceed the basic wage ruling in the district
where he resides. By these means the Gov-
ernment hopes “to relieve the wants of the
human wreckage that occur from following
the occupation of a miner.” But it is a
queer use for a Federal subsidy: it is a
charge proper to the industry itself, though
it is too late to talk about that now.

Shares in the La Fortuna Gold Mines, Ltd.,
are now being offered for sale in Kalgqorlie
and Perth (W.A.). The show, which is some
distance north of Coolgardie, is stated to
have a lode 100 ft. wide from which an ex-
traction of 225. per ton is expected. Work-
ing costs are estimated at 13s. per ton, which
the prospectus states is about the same as
that averaged by the Great Victoria Co. on
the Yilgarn field. This may be so, but con-
ditions at the Victoria are different. The
Victoria is working a surface deposit of later-
ite, which is much cheaper to mine than a
lode formation. In any case, very little
money has been made in the West from
working 225. ore; and as all costs in connec-
tion with the gold industry continue on
the up-grade the La Fortuna may well be
left to optimists.

One of the recent blazes in Victoria set
alight the open cut at Yallourn from which
John Monash gets the damp brown bricks
that are so expensive to burn. For awhile
the quarry resembled the inside of a crater,
and before the fire was put out one of the
big shovels was destroyed. The damage is
reckoned at £20,000, and before it is repaired
a hint dropped by the German expert who
reported on the place might be considered.
He said that the great shovels were a mistake.
They dug out the coal in lumps that hold all
the moisture, which is Yallourn’s chief
trouble. If belt conveyors were used, much
of the damp would be automatically dried out
while the stuff was passing through the air.

North Farrell (Tas.) dropped back to a
9800-ton output in its last six months’ cam-
paign, or to the level of the June term of 1923.
Breakage of plant was partly responsible, but
the depletion of reserves over No. 6 level
left No. 7 to supply the mill until the lode
could be opened off No. 8. However, it sup-
plied about a third of the yield, mostly from
development work, and will be the mainstay
of the show until the shaft is down another
lift and 'No. 9 level driven. That will
take about six months’ hard going. Down at
No. 8 the lode, where cut, was 10ft., but it
shrank to 6ft. of hard, high-grade sulphides
until they were 50ft. out from the crosscut.
Thence for another 60ft. it has been poor
stuff. The same phenomenon occurred over-
head, and if experience is repeated good ore
should come in again some distance to the
north. South, after 45ft. of high-grade sul-
phides was opened up, the lode narrowed,
and now is blocked out by a make of
quartz. Rises show that ore lies above the
intrusion. In the face of the in-and-out
values the co. netted £18,558 for the half-
year. The cash position is sound. Debts
are only about £2400, there is £7400 cash
in hand (above div. commitments, stores
amount to £5190, ore in stock £6589, and
sundry debtors £5210. Not a bad showing,
but high lead prices made it possible.

Deep-lead mining in Vic. being dead,
Harry Dodd, of Ararat, tripped off to the
Northern Territory to sample and report on
Silver Mountain, 25 miles from the Pine
Creek terminus. This show is under offer
to an Ararat and Stawell syndicate which
gave Dodd the jaunt. He returns with his
grip full of samples which tally as high as
lOOoz. silver and 64 p.c. lead. Of course, this
grade is better than Broken Hill ore, but
it is not necessary to trip to the N.T. to get
such glittering samples; more than a few
of equally rich silver-lead ore can be found
in mines round Zeehan. The drawback is
that there isn’t enough of it to pay divs.
.Harry Dodd’s luck is a thing to swear by,
and if someone in the N.T. has a big make
of lOOoz. and 64 p.c. ore to quit on job-lot
terms, it is more likely to drift his way than
in most other directions.

With a fresh issue of scrip the Rose,
Thistle and Shamrock is raising capital to
put in plant to cheapen costs. The stone
goes about an oz., so on that score the equip-
ment seems right; but the trouble with the
show all through has been its short gohl-
shoots. To swell reserves prodding on the
course of the old Rose formation goes on, but
gold contents there so far only cover battery
out-of-pocket exes. At 150 ft. ahead folded
country is expected, where better-grade stone
may be got; but it will be like a hunt in a
maze. The underlie shaft on the Shamrock
shoot is to go down further now that the
480 level is opened up, and with stone de-
veloped in two levels battery punching will
soon be on a larger scale.

The dust-up over Mt. Bischoff was poor
stuff. If the old half-century show is to
blossom again it has to keep going on the
north faces and work the drifts down the
North valley. All the famous south faces
have been stripped clean, the final brush-up
having been done by Senator Millen’s broom.
Manager J. H. Levings brought the brown
face formation again into production, and
£7lOO has been netted from it in the last
six months. Now the flat make of ore carries
better tin, but the real reserves lie on the
north slope and in the alluvium. On Smith’s
section 500,000 c. yds. of 21b. oxide ground
is said to have been, proved, but £20,000 will
be needed for equipment if the ground is to
be handled. Of that sum £13,000 is in hand,
and it rests with Lindesay Clark to say
whether the cash shall be used to provide
plant to work the flats or whether the money
shall be split up among shareholders. Greedy
souls would have that done without waiting
for Clark’s report, leaving the future to look
after itself. The Launceston Harts, who
hold the voting power, are inclined to give
the mine a further spin should the Briseis
man’s report be favorable.
After chasing over a large portion of
looking for likely oil areas, Adel-
aide Oil Exploration Co. returns to its old
love, Tasmania, and will drill two wells
there. This is the only State that does not
participate in the Federal Government’s
petroleum subsidy, opinion of all the leading
geologists being against the possibility of oil
being found there. But the withholding of
assistance does not deter a co. which loudly
proclaims that it is the best-financed and
money-saving oil-seeking organisation in the
Commonwealth.
The presentation of proxies at the
approaching annual meeting of Mt. Isa
Mines, Ltd., will probably disclose a stiff
fight between Randolph Bedford and the
nominee of the co., Frank Hambridge, for
the new seat on the directorate. Bedford is
now one of the biggest individual share-
holders, and will get a pretty solid vote
from Queensland and from ex-shareholders
in the Isa Prop. Among matters to be ven-
tilated will be the co.’s deep-boring campaign
which was started nearly six months ago,
and from which no results have been forth-
coming. While the delay was partly due to
ar. accident to the borer, it w 7 as much more
delayed by a lack of foresight in not having
a complete boring outfit. Thus when a break
occurred below no fishing tools were avail-
able, and a good six weeks were lost. And,
anyhow, the expediency of deep boring at
the present time is open to argument.
Production at Finney’s Hill United (Q.)
is held up awaiting parts for the Marcy mill,
due next week from U.S.A. Prospecting
work advised by Dr. Jensen is being pushed
ahead at the 228 ft. level, where the ore
body has apparently split or constricted.
Three drives are being advanced —n.-e., n.-w.
and e. No values have yet come in in the
two former, but the east is showing favor-
able symptoms in the shape of scattered
values in the face.

Ivampar River ( F.M.S.), a co. in 120,000
20s. shares, is having no end of trouble over
the sale of its property. Shareholders
thought everything in the garden looked
lovely when the purchasing syndicate planked
dowm the preliminary deposit of £B7OO. being
10 p.c. of the purchase-price. Second
thoughts, however, have prompted a litigious
desire to secure the return of the boodle and
a rescission of the agreement, on the grounds
that the directors of Ivampar River were
aware that their boring chart had not been
confirmed by check boring, and that this had
not been divulged to the purchasers. The
Board replies that prospectus values never
came into the negotiations, and that the
merits or demerits of the property were never
discussed from that standpoint. In this
frame of mind they intend to meet the legal
onset, to hang on to the £B7OO, and to go
for damages for breach of contract.

Alluvial Tin at £24 presents the most en-
thusiastic inflation on Sydney ’Change since
the inception of Malayan and kindred bucket-
dredging with Australian capital. The co.
is a holding one in 50,000 20s. shares, of
which 20,000 were issued a couple of years
ago and the balance reserved —perhaps for
bonus purposes. The “Wild Cat” commented
(3/9/’25) on the then swollen state of the
market at £lO. There was a credit at p. and
1. of £130,630, of which £117,000 represented
shares acquired during the year to March 31
—15,750 in Ivundang and 30,000 each in
Malim Nawar South, Kuala Ivampar and
Tanjong Tualang, while 11,250 had been
taken in Tanah Biji, another holding con-
cern. The 20,255 held in Malim Nawar, the
first pup, were acquired in 1924. Not an
ounce of tin has been produced from the
group, although the Malim Nawar dredge is
well past the scheduled time for production,
and shares are marketable about 41s. The
general inflation has caught up Malim Nawar
South to 415., Kuala Ivampar to 365., Tan-
jong Tualang to 345., Ivundang to 335. 3d.,
and Tanah Biji to about 755. Lumping all
these premiums (which are not realisable in
big parcels) about £150,000 has been added
by Pitt-street operations to the speculative
£130,633 —figures which amount- to about
£340000 when leases under consideration
are added. At £24, the 20,000 shares in the
co. have an aggregate value of £480,000,
which makes the inflation all the more
bubbly. Perhaps a bonus issue is contem-
plated. But that won’t add to the real value
of anything.
Alluvial Tin has incubated another chick
which it has named the Changkat, “about
four miles from Malim Nawar South.” This
is in Lower Perak, F.M.S. F. G. Pratten,
J. M. Newman and T. A. Duffy are on the
board. Of the 120,000 20s. shares, 71,000
are contribs. with ss. paid on them, and
49,000 go to the promoters. It is a thick
cut. No prospectus has become visible, and
the only scraps of information are supplied
by a broker’s circular, offering his clients
the shares at ss. 6d. premium. The co. has
a 400-acre area, of which 250 acres, bored
as deep as 63ft., is believed to hold 25,000,000
yards of .81b. values and 150 acres should go
Boz., with 15,000,000 yardage. A dredge of
150,000 yards monthly capacity is proposed.
Although everything is very much in the
air, vestibule quotes for the ss. paids have
been moved up to about 155., so that once
again Pitt-street is well ahead of the dredge.

“Elgar”: A band of fire-fighters around
Boronia, on the Avestern face of the Dande-

mount, and were trying to save a cottage
jccupied by an elderly lady and her niece.
There was no sign of either, and the would-
De rescuers, concluding that they had
;scaped, were about to leave the place to
the flames when the niece rushed up with the
news that her aunt, w T ho is very deaf, was
still inside, A scorched and blackened bush-
man grabbed a bag and rushed into the cot-
tage. He tried two rooms, and then opened
the door of a third. It was the bathroom,
and the lady herself, oblivious to the roar
of the flames, was enjoying a cool refresher.
She shrieked and began “How dare you!”
but was cut short with “Good God,
woman, your house is on fire!” Then he
grabbed a wrapper lying handy, picked up
the scandalised bather and ran out; a few
minutes later all the old lady’s visible pos-
sessions were the wrapper and an acre of
blackened soil. But even after the helping
women had fixed her up and found shelter
for her, she was still too indignant to thank

“Erua”: Talking of Governors and beer,
Maoriland had an Ex. who was deeply
addicted to trout-fishing. He and his stall
spent much of their leisure time angling in
the thermal districts ; they would pitch their
camp in some sylvan solitude with instruc-
tions that they were not to be annoyed with
the things of the outer world. On one
occasion an agitated messenger arrived in
Rotorua with an important dispatch for his
Ex. and sought directions to the vice-regal
camp. As the small launch left the jetty
with final instructions as to which stream to
follow from the lake, Henare, w’ho was as
usual hovering interestedly round, came along
with a little kindly advice. “You want te
Kuv’nor? Orri’. You see te creek with no
peer-pottles on him. Well, he not t'ere. Ten
you see te creek with all te peer-pottles front-

“Nikko”: When incoming steamers from
Maoriland reported that they had met the
smoke from the Victorian bush-fires a good
500 miles out at sea, the distance traversed
by the smoke appeared amazing, but since
then the northern part of Maoriland has been
attributing a thick haze to the same cause.
At Raglan, a west-coast port, a heavy black
cloud was seen travelling across the ocean
towards the land; it went inland and en-
veloped several townships. As Maoriland
reported no extensive fires, and the smoke
could hardly have originated at sea,, the con-
clusion is that the smoke-cloud from Victoria
travelled 1200-odd miles without being to
any extent dissipated.

tion, was accidentally dropped into the slot
of the carriage window. Fishing with a
wire and appeals to officialdom failed to
recover it. Some years later that particular

carriage was mixed up in the big Sunshine
(Vie.) railway smash, and a rescue party
found the medal lying on a dead passenger.
An official telegram notifying the death of
their son was sent to the Kerrisons, who,
knowing that the wiuner of the medal was
on duty 500 miles away from Sunshine when
the smash happened, took no notice of the
“news.” The Railway Department restored
the medal later to the man whose name and
address it bore, with apologies for the pre-

“Bill o’ Costs” : The lady who was observed
by a Bulletin contributor taking the bailiff
out for an airing in her motor-car reminds
me of a young sportsman of my early
acquaintance. He inherited a big vineyard,
but made the pace faster than his wine
matured ; consequently the “man in posses-
sion” was no stranger to him. . But he always
treated liis compulsory guest with unfailing
courtesy and frequently with generous hos-
pitality as well. I remember one occasion
when, to enliven the tedium for the sheriff’s
officer and himself, my friend (call him
Blanque) organised a cricket match on the
spot. Blanque’s XI v. Bum’s was how the
contending teams were scheduled. The host
made up his own side from his employees and
friends, and such bailiffs as were available
were stiffened with recruits from neighboring
villages. All the players were suitably en-
tertained in the cellars at the close of the
game, and several appropriate toasts honored.
Blanque has gone where bailiffs cease from
troubling, but if any of these particular ones
survive they probably reflect in gloomy
moments that the spirit- of camaraderie to-
wards the profession isn’t what it used to be.
“lan C.”: A South Gippslander has been
recalling an experience when the district was
stricken by busli-fires some 20 years ago. A
settler then, he took refuge against the
oncoming flames in his household galvanised
iron tank, which was half full of water. Un-
fortunately, the spot being handy and dry,
he had been in the habit of stacking a few
days’ supply of kindling firewood beneath the
tank. The little heap caught and the water
became warmer and warmer. But for a
while there was no escape, and he had to
submit to the parboiling until the passing of
the flames gave him a chance.
“Sixenate” : Pate played one of its curious
tricks upon a woman whose troubles have
been reviewed by Justice Owen in Syd-
ney. She married in England, but, growing
tired of her husband, bolted to Australia;
having decided that that was about the last
place on earth where he was likely to trouble
her again. Confident in this belief, she pre-
sently took another mate. Then one day she
happened on the report of a Sydney divorce
case, wherein the petitioner described how
the wife he had married in England had dis-
appeared, leaving no trace, and, having estab-
fished his domicile in Australia, he claimed
relief from the bond, which was duly granted.
The petitioner was the husband the woman
had left. The man she was now legally
entitled to marry got to know of it; but it
was his turn to be annoyed, and, instead
of re-marrying the lady well and truly, he
secured a decree of nullity. Altogether the
lady is entitled to regard Fate as a mis-
chievous meddler.

“Hannan's”: The habit of persons who
live under the open sky of utilising their
boots for notecases* (B. 25/2/’26) became
more than a joke in one part of Australia
some 30 years ago. In the roaring days of
the W.A. goldfields, the late W. T. Loton,
who was then an M.L.C. as well as chairman
of the West Australian Bank, complained
bitterly in Parliament of the number of bank-
notes that were returned to the head office
in an atrociously offensive condition, after
the very shortest of lives, because goldfielders
bound for new rushes insisted on making
purses of their heavy (and too often sock-
less) footwear. Loton declared it was un-
fair to bank officials as well as a source of
unnecessary expense to the bank that the
currency should be “mutilated” thus. Ana
considering that the prospector mostly walked
—whereas “Teller’s” drover rode —there were
probably some grounds for the complaint.
“Pinktape” : I wonder if Justice ever per-
mits herself a wink behind that bandage.
At Griffith (N.S.W.) several men, including
a doctor, were charged with being on licensed
premises at Yenda after hours. The defence
gravely set forth that all the accused except
the doc. had driven to Yenda, after the
races at Griffith, because one of them wanted
medical advice about his sore throat. Whilst
the others waited at the pub, the afflicted
one sought out the Galen. Having pre-
scribed, the doctor said that his patient
ought to have a stimulant before going home,
and he accompanied the poor chap to
the hotel to see that he was served with the
medicine and took it properly. And a
P.M. who is probably as human as his neigh -
bor and knows wdiat a race-day throat is
like, decided solemnly that all the others as
travellers, were entitled to a drink; further,
although the professional man had no right
to be on the pub premises, it was obviously
only his strong sense of professional duty
which took him there. Good, sound logic,
too; nevertheless, I should like to have seen
the expression on the police-sergeant s face
when all the cases were dismissed.

“Ricardo” : The funniest “strike” I recall
was when the barbers of Broken Hill, in
1910, were declared black for raising then-
prices. The Barrier unionists w-ei-e flushed
with recent victories: they had just won a
great beer strike, forcing down the price of
the pint from (id. to 4d.; they had spoiled
the visit of the S’African cricketers because
the local team played an “undesirable” ; and
they had put the South Broken Hill Racing
Club on the blink by a boycott because the
secretary wore the wrong kind of necktie. So
they went out gaily to bring the barbers to
their senses. The editor of the Labor organ
wrote thundering leaders against the “barber
brigands” and the tame poet turned out
“barberous ballads.” We arranged for dis-
plays of safety-razors in all the hardware
shops, and there was a great run on them.
Staunch unionists volunteered for active ser-
vice as amateur hairdressers and hogged the
manes of comrades free of charge. It was not
until the secretary of the Hairdressers’ Union
produced his books to prove that his members
would 'get the greater part of tin; increased
prices that the ban was lifted, and the cheer-
ful cry of “You're next’’ once more resounded
in Argent-street.

“Nakhoda” : My next-door neighbor in this
Melbourne suburb is a pious man. On Sun-
day evenings In; plants his loud-speaker in his
drawing-room window and lets an Anglican
church service blare
into the night while
he lies in a long
chair on his lawn
in ecstasies of devo-
tion. A good cigar
and t a wliisky-soda
help him to main-
tain his reverent
attitude. On the
other side of the
street a Methodist
family attends the
service of its de-
nomination, also on
the lawn. Both
parties are catholic
in their tastes, and
listen out to a Sal-
vation Army meet-
ing or a Mass with
equal fervor. As a
student of com-
parative religion, I
at first found the
performance inter-
esting, but it begins
to lack variety.
What I want to
know is: Does the
obligation not to
trespass on a neigh-
bor extend into tlie ether?
* * * *
“Kerys”: There are quite a number of
ways of converting political opponents. Just
prior to tlie recent Federal elections a well-
known suburban M.P. was called on early
one morning by an agitated wife to come
and remove an intruder who had just been
discovered, dead to the world, in their wash-
house. Investigation disclosed quite a promi-
nent citizen of the neighborhood, who, when
forcibly dragged to his feet and prodded into
wakefulness, showed a pathetic agitation over
his plight. “A bit of an evening at the
bowling-club,” he explained huskily; “but I
don’t remember what for. I don’t know how
I got in here.” The M.P. dusted the trans-
gressor and rang up his family to acquaint
them that he had taken the reveller to his
(the M.P.’s) home on account of sudden in-
disposition. Then he crammed him into a
taxi. “I detest your politics,” said the grate-
ful guest as he drove off. “but you’ll get my
vote next week.” And the good Samaritan
still doubts if lie would have got it in any
other way. * ♦ #
“Tarago” : The SOS sent out by the Gipps-
land bush-fire relief committees, asking
donors to cease sending parcels of clothing,
reminds me that after the fires of 1898 par-
cels arrived in such quantities that our local
committee got tired of handling them, and
told the s.m. to do what ’e darn well liked
with the rest. Consignments continued to
lob in, and when the suffering settler walked
in to inquire if his coil of wire or bit of
building timber had arrived, the harassed
s.m. would endeavor to soothe his disappoint-
ment by throwing him a parcel of clothing—
and generally getting it thrown back. One
morning a mate of mine turned up on the
iob arrayed in a belltopper, smoked glasses,
Beaufort coat, lavender pants and a pair
of Hugh Thompson’s No. 10’s. The linen,
though a trifle soiled and crumpled, was in
keeping with the rest of his attire. Inciden-
tally, they also sent our bush township a
manual fire-engine—with a complete set of
firemen’s uniforms and helmets ! The machine
was parked outside, and stopped there bogged
to the axles in the soft soil until another
bush-fire came along and partly destroyed
it. But the uniforms weren’t wasted; they
came in handy for fancy-dress at the local
hops for years after.

“Sixenate”: In a rather pathetic murder
trial at Melbourne last week it was men-
tioned that the quarrel started when the two
heads of the family failed to agree about the
location of a tramstop. It finished by a 17-
year-old son firing a sliot to check an enraged
father who was threatening to wipe out the
whole family. Very small matches light very
large blazes on the family hearth. I recall
one which had its start when a boy laughed
at the way in which his father, au unlettered
farmer, had spelt a word. The mother, in
saving the boy from a thrashing, made some
THE INFANT (1926 PATTERN).
MAUDIE (after her first attendance): "I hate Sunday-school!"
MOTHER: “Why, darling? You hare always liked to go to church

unpleasant remark about the old man’s igno-
rance, and the pair wandered into a discus-
sion about each other’s ancestry which only
finished when the man brought down a chair
upon his wife’s head. But that was not the
tragedy; the wife recovered. It was the hus-
band who, smitten with remorse for his
violence, withdrew into an outshed and shot
himself. The moral is not pointed against
marriage. After all, there are a multitude
of married people who only half-murder one
another.
* * * *
“Riwaka”: It is not only military mess-
ages that get mutilated when passed from
mouth to mouth (B. 18/2/’26). A lady
recently asked a bookselling friend of mine
for a book she called “Australia, Blind and
Blasted.” She said it had been much praised
by a friend of hers. My friend made several
inquiries at wholesale houses for a book of
that name. No one had heard of it. Then
a bright girl clerk suggested that what he
was after was “Australia’s Blind Ambas-
sador.” She was right.
* * * *
“Witenhana” : Hasty weddings? He was
from Wanganui (M.L.) ; she was with a
theatrical company playing there for two
nights only. They
obtained the proper
papers from the
registrar’s office,
but the registrar
himself had gone
home, where they
found him milking
a cow. To wait
would have made
the bride late for
her turn at the
Opera House, so
the ’groom admin-
istered a hearty
smack which set
Strawberry mov-
ing, upset the
bucket and upended
the registrar. That
official rose to the
occasion like a
sport, and tied the
knot there and
then. A few min-
utes later the bride was back behind the foot-
lights.
* * * *
“Clydesider”: The S. M. Herald had a
leader about “Historical Analogies” on Feb-
ruary 20, but it wasn’t the paper's lucky day.
Speculating on the possible- restoration of
the Holienzollerns in Germany, it quoted the
Stuarts as a parallel case, and gave them a
rough passage. Charles I. was accused 01.
possessing “no redeeming traits,” and charged
with having “squandered the revenues of the
realm in base pleasures.” The narrow, pious,
bigoted and headless Charles was a pattern
of domestic virtue. He hadn’t a base
pleasure in his composition, and very little
pleasure of any sort. The Anglican Church has
put him on its list of saints. Next the
.Herald blamed the same Charles for estab-
lishing the Star Chamber, which was abol-
ished in his reign, after flourishing under all
the Tudors. It has been unreliably traced
back to the early Plantagenets. The same
organ of public opinion alleged that “the
Stuarts were upstarts compared with the
Hohenzollerns,” though they climbed on to
a throne in 1371, which was 99 years before
the first Hohen-Z. became a minor princelet
in Brandenburg. By way of further effort
the temporarily demented journal said that
the Stuarts lasted “only 74 years all told,"
which is abput right if the eight purely Scot-
tish sovereigns of the line are omitted, also
Mary 11. and Anne. Then it placed the
Young Pretender’s uprising “almost 50 years
after the deposition of James II.” instead of
57 j 7.1: after, and having done that it rested
from its labors. The subsequent noises were
the Stuart family ghost breaking things be-
cause some fool had called it an upstart. It
wouldn’t have minded being called a mere
scoundrel, nor would it have much minded
being called a failure, but “upstart” was
over the odds.
* * * *
“Sixenate” : In Sydney, as in Melbourne,
the Yellow Cab people have been forced to
secure injunctions to restrain sundry private
taxi-owners who have imitated the appear-
ance of their vehicles. But several of the
injunctioned drivers have merely altered the
color of their cars to some other shade of
orange and continued to trade on the re-
semblance. And this is only part of the
battle. The company’s drivers have to face
the hostility of a multitude of single-car men
who feel that the company’s organisation and
regulated charges and conditions are spoiling
their business. In Melbourne there was a
whole series of assaults; and in Sydney the
other day a yellow-cab man dragged into
court a pirate whom he accused of punctur-
ing all his tyres. There was a similar con-
flict between the old horse-cabbies and the
motor-men when the hire-car first arrived.
The Jehus in Sydney fought, by deputation
and appeal, to keep the cars off city ranks,
and, having a strong organisation, affiliated
with the Labor Council, succeeded to some
extent; when they didn’t succeed there was
often a resort to fists. Nowadays a few
ramshackle horse-cabs still survive, but most
of them are dropping to pieces—a dozen o,
the old vehicles, being unsaleable, were burnt
off by an owner the other day.
“W.E.F.H.”: Re casual fishermen (B.
25/2/’26). A few years ago the deep-sea
anglers between Botany and Bondi (Sydney)
included an old man in his seventies and a
youth in his teens. They were drifting
above a reef about two miles out with halt
a dozen other boats when a storm blew up.
All the others made at once for the shore,
but the couple lingered, reluctant to leave
their good patch. When the last skiff pulled
in and reported that the laggards were stiff
out among the white-caps there was a rush
for the ’phone. Presently the Captain Cook,
the old pilot steamer from Watsons Bay,
and sundry freelances were all trying to
rescue the elusive fishermen. Towards even-
ing a worried-looking copper made lus way
THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT.
“Phil is so temperamental —everything about her has to be in tone.”
“Yes, I noticed that she’d had her dog’s tail bobbed, too.”
towards tlie old chap’s home to report that
the wreckage of his boat had been found
on a near-by beach and that hope had been
abandoned, when his melancholy reflections
were interrupted by a burst of Bacchanalian
song. Striding towards the source of it he
was amazed to find the missing couple alive
and tanked. Their boat had overturned in
the surf a few yards from the beach, and
after some campers had hauled them out
rescuers and rescued had walked three miles
to a pub to celebrate the deliverance.

There has been junketing in Melbourne
over the Victorian manager’s jubilee in the
service of the A.M.P. Society. F. T. Bridges,
whose father was once Under-Secretary for
Education in N. S. Wales, and general-
manager Apperly took their canings together
at the old Fort-street school in Sydney, tied
for dux of the seminary, entered the A.M.P.
almost together, and went up the ladder simul-
taneously six rungs at a time ; but Apperly
was eight months Bridges’s senior, and re-
tained the start which that gave him. The
big Australian concern owes much to its
founders, but it owes a great deal also to
the younger men who have promoted a fine
spirit in the staff. Among the comforts of
the Melbourne office is a dining-room, where
a clerk can get three good courses for a shil-
ling or a cup of tea, plus a bun or so, for
threepence.
A Westralian Parliamentarian who had
so much consideration for Hansard that he
never gave it a “turn” has just died. Cutli-
bert McKenzie was a practical Albany resi-
dent who did his best very well during the
75 years or so that he glimpsed the Sound.
He was a “bay whaler” in the old days, and
reckoned the truest liarpooner along the
coast. For many years he was Mayor of
Albany, then entered the Leg. Council as a
Liberal (later Country party), and remained
there for years. He never made a speech,
had many a good sleep in the Chamber, and
always knew how to vote if Charley Piesse
was in the House. Somebody once asked
him jokingly why he didn’t make a speech.
“Wal,” he said, “if you lived in Albany
would you wan ter talk about it and draw
attention to it and have the place sp’iled?”
William Leonard, who died at Toorak
(Melb.) last week, was mainly responsible
for the Australian weiglit-for-age scale. He
was a keen statistician and turf man, but
preferred the executive to the actual sporting
side of racing. tie arrived from County
Kerry in 1853, being then just of age.
Castlemaine and Moonlight Flat gold dig-
gings knew him first and brought early suc-
cess. Graduating to cattle-dealing, he
eventually established himself as a pastoral-
ist. Deeds for many large slices of Aus-
tralia were held by him during the past 60
years, Goondiwindi (Q.) being his most profit-
able. He raced a few horses now and again,
but never fluked a champion. Master Foote
was liis best. With Hurtle Fisher and Captain
Standisli, Leonard was on the V.R.C. sub-
committee that set handicaps prior to E.
T. Barnard’s appointment as paid weight-
adjuster in 1870. For 48 years he was a
V.R.C. committeeman, and his son Clive is
present V.A.T.C. chairman. Other sons.
Charles and Robert, also follow in a fine old
dad’s footsteps, so far as sport is concerned.
It is 14 years ago this month since Frank
Bryant (Typographical Assoc.), Ernie
Farrar (Saddlers’ Union and President of
the Labor Council) and Teddy Kavanagli
(Secretary Labor Council) were given their
gold passes as Leg. Councillors. The batch
also included Tom Holden (McGowen’s
barber and President of the Redfern Labor
League), J. A. Browne, Dr. Henry Doyle,
Andy Sinclair and Joyntou Smith. The
three Trades Hall lights were given a con-
gratulatory night at their stronghold and
there were loud cheers at the prospect of
the immediate abolition of the Council. Last
week evey one of the bunch except Kavanagh
voted against the Abolition Bill. The ancient
Hepher. who, with Jimmy Wilson, was
one of the first two Laborites appointed (in
1899) to the Upper House, cast his vote
with the suicides; but Jack Travers, who
was appointed in 1908 (he used to be secre-
tary to the Eight Hours Committee) voted
as an anti-abolitionist.
Conservatism in Vic. is mourning John
West, who died the other day at his farm at
Toolern. Giving up an orchard in the Goul-
burn Valley 30 years ago, he became a pro-
pagandist for the men on the land. The
Argus gave him plenty of space, first as a
contributor and then on its staff. Seemingly
he took himself more seriously than did the
people whose cause he championed, as he
failed to gain majorities when he tried for
the Federal Convention and for Parliament.
For a decade he had a snug job as sec. of
the National Union, the inner shrine of Con-
servative-Liberalism. Five years ago he
went back to the land, and had almost been
forgotten by most of his former admirers
when the end came.
Just-dead J. W. Lindt, though a German
by birth, was a lover of Australia. After an
adventurous life in the South Sea Islands
and New Guinea, during which he garnered
some exhibits for Melbourne Museum and
made many interesting photographs, he built
for himself a beautiful home on the Blacks’
Spur (Vic.), surrounding it with native
plants. He kept his camera busy, too, and
the legend “J. W. Lindt, Photo.,” is familiar
in British and foreign periodicals. Much
of his work has been used also on the Vic-
torian Railways.
Carl Frederick Renkert, whose remains
have just been cremated at Dresden, whither
he had gone in the hope of health, was the
pioneer of the travelling-bag trade in N. S.
Wales. Under the Freetrade conditions of
’9O he started a workshop with his country-
man, E. Manok, still in the business, and
together they went through a bitter uphill
fight. In four months they took £l6. The
principal lines in those days were the Glad-
stone-bag and the brief-bag. The Germans
were good and industrious workers. One
importing house admitted to Renkert that his
lines were superior to the imported, even
in point of price, but he added: “This is
not our buying market, old man. If you
get a hold here there will be no room for
us.” But the Teutons stuck to their task,
and Protection arrived, and their workshop
became a factory. Presently others started,
and they grew, and York-street lost the trade.
His last request was that his ashes should
be returned to his adopted country.
ROGERS, M. H. R. for Wannon.
Trouble has fallen in an avalanche on Ben-
jamin Benny, the Federal Senator from
South Aus., who lately resigned his seat.
Benny, a solicitor, has been in bad health
for some time, and it was suggested that his
mental state was not satisfactory—he was
in hospital for some time. Now, however, he
has been declared insolvent, and a dissatisfied
client has asked the Courts to investigate a
transaction in which the ex-Senator was pro-
fessionally involved.
Died recently at Whangarei, North Auck-
land, Thomas Lowrie Drummond, aged 76,
one of the best-known artists of the
Dominion. In addition to being a landscape
painter of merit, Drummond was a success-
ful hardware merchant. He was a great
worker and frequent exhibitor, and most
M.L. galleries possess some of his character-
istic grey-blue pictures.
Sydney’s Hyde Park and Domain used to
be enclosed with tall spikes. In the last
year of last century somebody in office noticed
■heir rusty condition, and the unemployed,
then numerous, were put to work scraping
and repainting them. Boer War contin-
genters used to throw the friendly gibe at
their cobbers that scraping the Hyde Park
railings was their last job. The prison-like
fixtures passed years ago, and now the man
who put them up, old George Brown, has
passed also, aged 83.
Adelaide has lost a sound man of business
and a good sportsman in George Auld. His
father, the still better-known Patrick Auld,
was one of the founders of Auldana vine-
yards and one of the men who accompanied
McDouall Stuart on the pioneer journey
across Australia from south to north in 1862.
George became secretary to the Phylloxera
Board, chairman of directors of Adelaide
Wine and Spirit Co., and president of S.A.
Vinegrowers’ Association. He was a cricketer
and hunting-man, but in particular he shone
on the river and at lacrosse. He became head
of the bodies governing each of these sports
in S.A.
The marriage of John Cain, Labor mem-
ber for Jika Jika in Vic. Assembly, reduces
the number of bachelors in the House to
four.
Tom O’Halloran, K.C., becomes chairman
of the F'ootball League in Adelaide, now
that McLaclilan has been sent to the Federal
Senate. He showed himself a strong deputy
in the chair during McLacMan’s recent visit
to England. The League has a strong fancy
for lawyers—and K.C.’s if possible—at its
head. Cleland preceded McLachlan in the
chair, and Jim Anderson was before him.
One Cooper, a retailer of small beer in the
way of suburban chronicles, whose “History
of Prahran” has been godfathered by the
local council, has dug up some letters written
by ill-fated O’Hara Burke. They show the
leader of the Burke and Wills expedition in
a new and rather pathetic light as one whose
movements were hampered by fear of an
impending arrest for debt. He writes to a
friend imploring his help in lifting a dis-
honored p.n., and makes only a passing allu-
sion to the great undertaking that lay before
him.
W. M. Shannon, who has been reappointed
one of Vic.’s three Railway Commissioners
for another seven years at a salary of £1950
a year, has a record of which he can be proud.
He entered the service, at the age of 12, 45
years ago, as an apprentice fitter, and was
successively fitter, draftsman, chief drafts-
man, assistant mechanical engineer, chief
mechanical engineer, and in 1919 Commis-
sioner. He looks after the electrification,
stores and rolling-stock sections, besides giv-
ing an eye to part of the inside staff.
There’s one Chinese family, born in Aus-
tralia, with two Bachelors of Science in it.
Sue Yek, who runs a little general store in
Rockhampton (Q.), sent Frederick to the
Hong Kong Uni. for his final training; and
after graduating brilliantly he was appointed
lecturer in engineering. George got his
B.Sc. at Brisbane. There are other brothers
whose tastes are literary: one of them writes
the sporting notes for a Brisbane paper.
Rymer, the Queensland railwaymen’s
union secretary, is still hurling heated lan-
guage at Premier McCormack. He is handi-
capped in print by the necessity of masking
the vigor of his colloquial style with euphem-
isms. Thus, in an open letter to the Pre-
mier, he reproached him for his proiiaganda
“against anyone who has the intestinal
stamina to expose your ‘strong-man’ stunts
on behalf of the capitalist class.” “Intes-
tinal stamina” is charming.
Something near a world’s record as a
member of a hospital committee —or any
other committee—must be held by James In-
gram, known as the G.O.M. of Beechworth
(Vic.), who has been a member of the com-
mittee of the local hospital for 70 years, and
is the only survivor of those who founded the
institution. He will reach the century in
another couple of years if the Reaper lets
him.
An old lady who was identified with early
M.L. history died recently at Auckland. Mrs.
James Duff Hewitt arrived with her parents
in Melbourne in 1854, and the family went
by chartered brig over to M.L., where the
daughter married a son of a Waterloo hero
and lived near Wanganui until her husband
was murdered by Maoris during the war.
Her book of reminiscences, “Looking Back-
ward,” has run to the fourth edition.
William Mclver, Vic. Director of Land
Settlement, was in Adelaide for the best part
of a week in the middle of February, and
rumor was busy with his name in connec-
tion with the State Bank job of £2500 a year.
Perhaps somebody was giving him a look-
over, or he was having a look over for himself.
He is one of the service’s biggest men, and
his rise, especially since soldier-settlement be-
came a feature, has been rapid. He now
draws £1750 a year, and could have been
Under-Treasurer or Auditor-General had he
pressed his claims. As it is he draws £5OO
a year more than either Norris or Pitt.
Henry H. Connell, the Paddington (Syd-
ney) Chamber magistrate, who is retiring
after 43 years’ service, is the grandson of

arrived in Melbourne to discover why citizens
are not getting kilowatts from the State
brown-coal scheme any cheaper than they
used to from the local manufactories. King
Coal, incidentally, is gaining in favor in
the States despite the prevalence of water-
power. In 1912 64.5 p.c. of the total juice
used came from fuel and 35.5 from the
distant waterfall. In 1925 the proportions
were 66.5 and 33.5.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
Kriz : The date of the arrival of the
dingo in Australia (B. 24/12/’25) still remains un-
answered. It is evident he had not reached southern
Australia before the separation of Tasmania from
t e mainland, and on the other hand his remains are
Baul to have been found below some of the later
cainozoic lavas of s.-e. Australia. There and in
the Wellington Valley caves of N. S. Wales his
hones were found associated with those of the
diprotodon, the norotherium and . the “marsupial
lion. At the present day his nearest relative is
the wild dog- of India, who is found in—among
other places- districts inhabited by the primitive pre-
Diavidian jungle people, who are considered to be
closely related to the aborigines of Australia.
“Slam” : Fossil bones found as deep down as 60ft.
undei very early rock formations prove conclusivelj
that the dingo was in Australia millions of yean
ago, and has survived without change. The First
Fleet theory was popular in the days when it used
to be stated, even in schools, that all Australian
animals were marsupials except the dingo, and some
explanation seemed necessary. In any case, there
could be nothing in the Santa Cruz origin theory,
because the dingo was described by Dampier in
16S8, before any of the First Fleeters were born,
He was, so far as we know, the first Englishman to
set foot on Australian soil, having been wrecked off
the north-western coast, and he described the dingo
as the “gaunt wolf” of the Great South Land.
* * * *
“Jim iCarew”: “Buttenderry” can take my
word for it (B. 28/l/’26) that the whisky which was
preserved for years in an earthen jar is a
beautifully mild and mellow’ spirit, about the finest
I have ever had the good fortune to sample. Inci-
dentally, this particular lot of “moonshine” is not
the only one I am acquainted with. My people
settled on the Upper Hawkesbury in 1867, and my
grandmother, not long after the family first moved
there, stored away some typical “wild-cat” stuff
in earthenware demijohns. Now it is equal to the
finest liqueur. It has been in the same demijohn all
the time.
* * * #
“Jesmond”: Westernport Bay (Vic.) is
subject to high tides if westerly gales accompanv
the spring tides. These are so destructive that
10ft. to 15ft. of the foreshore on Phillip Island may
be washed away during a single night. Many people
who have seen this are convinced that the island
is in process of slow elimination. Mv own observa-
tion, extending over 20 years, shows that this is not
the ease, but that the northern shores, at any rate,
gain from the wind what they lose by tlie sea.
Three times during the past 20 years there has been
a loss and gain of upwards of 70ft., and in no case
has the denudation extended beyond a certain limit,
which I term thfl erosive point. At present the bank
is about sft. in front of this point and is being
slowly built up by the wind, though a “westerly”
may take a slice off it at any time and it may be
years before the bank reaches its maximum depth.
Is this peculiar to the island, or has the same
phenomenon been observed in other districts?
* * * *
“Awstriith”: “Dorgs?” said “Liar” Smith,
butting into the discussion at Hogan’s pub. “Game
dorgs? Yeah. Yours might be a good dorg. But
if yer want ter see a real game dorg c’morn out ter
my place an’ take a screw at Fitz. Yestdee mornin’
W’en I gets up I sees ’im pointin’ near th’ wood’eap.
‘C’morn outer that, yer blamin’ fool,’ I sez, ‘there
ain t nothin’ there.’ Ole Fitz ’e don’t move; so,
knowin’ there ain’t nothin’ there, I goes an’ ’as me
breakfus. W’en I finishes Fitz is still pointin’, so
I ’eaves a brick at ’im. It catches ’im in th’ slats
an does ’e move? ’E does not. I gets curious an’
strolls over an’ peers all roun’ th’ wood’eap an’
chucks a few bricks about, but there ain’t nothin.’
So I walks up ter chase ole Fitz away. An’ then
I sees what th’ old bloke ’as been doin.’ Blowed if
’e ain’t settin’ th’ picture on a Rosella jam-tin.”
* * * *
“Arilcurra” : “B.T.’s” yarn (B. 31/12/’25)
about the effect of the “magic” practised on “a sister
of the mission at Oodnadatta” is pure bunkum. In the
first place there is no “mission at Oodnadatta” in
the customary sense of the term. The only insti-
tution is a cottage hospital (or hostei) conducted
by the Australian Inland Mission. The hospital
is a fine, big, modern type of bungalow, floored in the
kitchen and all other rooms with boards. The only
“earth floors” are those of the wide verandahs.
There is no mission station. The hospital is sur-
rounded by private houses on two sides, a boarding-
house on a third and the railway line in front.
So, if “8.T.” heard the yarn from a sister, he was
having his leg pulled.
* * * *
“H.H.”: This month ought to go down to
history in the annals of the Ma State as the
February that was hot enough to boil fish, on the
fin as it were. The Carrington swamp (Newcastle)
is a shallow sheet of water which contains a good
stock of mullet. On the day following the most
intense heat, five tons of fish were scraped from the
margin and carted away for manure. They had
been boiled alive. The same thing happens pretty
well every year when the lakes on the Lower
Darling run dry.
*‘* * #
“Keppel”: Re “Wallaby’s” rabbit, which
shot a man in the foot (B. 28,/l/’26). The other
day a newchum in Central Queensland had a shot
at his first kangaroo and wounded it. It lay on the
ground, apparently incapable of resistance, so he
approached and attempted to brain it with the butt
of the rifle. The ’roo, however, jumped up and
struck at the rifle, catching its paw in the trigger.
The rifle went off and the bullet passed through the
man’s leg.
“Copabella”: The death of George Malins,
Chief Grand Templar, awakens memories, not of
George but of his brother, a much more interesting
person. Twenty-five years ago, alone in the bush,
11 was looking after a selection in the owner’s absence.
li had put in my time cutting up all the firewood in
sight, and had it stacked in symmetrical heaps, each
as neat, as a four-post bed. Then one day arrived
QUITE READY TO DO HIS PART.
DAD: “Wot yer waitin’ for?”
CHUM: "Th cows, sir, and they don’t seem to be able to make up their minds whose
turn it is to yet done first.”
an elderly man on an aged ha]f-Pereheron. He had
a venerable beard, and his horse was festooned with
a collection of gear reminiscent of the White
Knight in “Alice in Wonderland. - ’ He looked down
oh the firewood heaps with something like horror.
Kewchum, I see, ’ he said. Then he sighed with
something like relief. “Gripes,” he breathed, “I
thought .Tones had taken on a Chow!” The visitor
was Alf Malins, who claimed to be the brother of
George the Templar, and he stayed quite a while.
Looking after out-stations was his vocation, the
loneliness seeming to suit his peculiar temperament.
His ancient horse carried all his needs—right down
to clothes-line and pegs, library, and a kit of
tools and he had cultivated self-dependence to such
an extent that he could cut his own hair—the only
man I know who could make a decent job of that
difficult feat. A year or two later I was runnng
a line of “made-to-measure” suits through the
stations, and Alf became a customer. It was then I
discovered another peculiarity. Alf had the biggest
hands ever seen. He pointed them out to me with
the pathetic comment that he could never buy a
ready-made pocket into which he could shove his
fist, and the Melbourne firm supplying me with
suits had to make at least one really to measure!
The coat sleeves were like small trouser legs, and
the cross pockets of the pants were like a pair of
kangaroo pouches.
“Coot”: The assertion of “W.R.” (B.
11/2/’26) that “the English skylark does not
thrive and multiply under the warm suns of Aus-
tralia” is incorrect as far as Victoria is concerned.
Thirty years ago the only spot near Melbourne where
they could be seen and heard was on the rifle
ranges at Williamstown. Now they are to be found
in quite a number of Melbourne suburbs which possess
a fair amount of open land. At Nortlicote, Ooburgi
and Camberwell —all within five miles of the
citj r proper—they are numerous, whilst on the plains
between Melbourne and Geelong and in the Western
district of Victoria they are still more abundant.
* * * *
“Really” : A curious native burial custom
prevailed at Florida, in the Solomon Islands, and
is still carried on in the mountainous regions of the
larger island of Guadalcanal A dead man’s pos-
sessions are taxed ; and the inheritors must bring
the amount of the tax to the funeral. It is then
wrapped up in the winding sheet of mats and buried
with the deceased. These legacy duties are paid in
various forms. The heir to a grove of cocoanuts
may pay in native money; the one who is left the
deceased’s smoking stock only must contribute a
few pipes and some tobacco. After the funeral,
food, pipes and tobacco are placed outside the dead
man’s house for the use of the departed spirit, who
is supposed to linger round for a few days before
quitting for its spiritual abode.
Jiinsey : The rabbit, when pressed, is a
capital swimmer. A few months back, near Sack-
ville Reach, Upper Hawkesbury River (N.S.W.), my
dog, a fox-terrier, chased one to the river’s bank.
Without hesitating, bunny plunged in and, with
Squizzy close behind, struck out for the opposite
side. The river there is about 250 yards wide, and
although the rabbit bad only about a yard's start
on the dog he reached the opposite bank a good
20yds. in the lead.
“Cuchulain”: Our run is divided by a creek. In
some places it is not more than 15ft. wide, but
has a pretty strong current. The rabbits on one
side regularly swim across to the other to feed, and
if frightened lose no time in paddling home.
“Dingo” : Bunny is a strong, and frequently willing,
swimmer, though the 300yds. claimed by “Sandy”
(B. 28/l/’26) would be a good task even for the
Boy Charltons of his tribe. The Gundagai Pastures
Protection Board (N.S.W.) used to accept the Mur-
MUM WAS ALWAYS THOROUGH.
“Look here, Missus, that hoy of ours has
taken money out of my pocket!”
“Oh, John, how can you say such a thing?
You might as well accuse me.”
“No, it wasn’t you. There teas some of it
left.”
rumbidgee, which was about 100yds. wide, as a
“natural barrier” against the rabbit for the purpose
of fencing, but thousands crossed under their own
steam in bad years when feed was scarce. A log
running into the tvater will often tempt a rabbit to
commence a swim he would not undertake from a
beach or high bank.

THE TRANSPORT PIONEERS.
[FOR THE BULLUTIN.]
The big steers browse on the Mitchell grass in the
bends of the Warrego,
And the idle teamsters sit and yarn at a fire that
smoulders low,
While the petrol carts go by the camp and fast to
the farthest shed,
Their horns quite hoarse with the funeral dirge- -
“The day of the teams is dead.”
So the teamsters yarn while a log-end burns and the
platform waggons rest—
The pride of a western wheelwright scrapped, each
wheel in a woolpack dressed.
And even the teamsters’ dogs bark back at the
sneers of the motor-horns,
While the transport kings of a bygone age wear a
mocking crowns of thorns.
The young men went with the smellful change and
fell for the easy terms,
And the old men's credit slipped away with the
western merchant firms.
The honest pride of the oxmen’s mocked by the
toot of a motor-man,
AVhile the tracks of the teams are dusted out by
the whir of an engine-fan.
There are pubs in town where they spent good cash
and bragged of their teams with pride;
And no one questioned the word of those who wielded
the plaited hide.
Ah, now they sit by a heap of ash, with their
waggons’ platforms bare,
Their eyes held fast to the embers black to read the
meaning there.
THS DRY STAGE.
“Note, ’Erbcrt , token we get inside, remem-
ber it’s your day to look on.”
The motor hogs with their loads of wool wheel
into the railway yard.
They freight back stores; and a tramp or two, who
have found the going hard,
Will open the squatters’ rotten gates and smooge
to the bloke who steers,
While the teamsters sit at a smoky fire and spit
out their unshed tears.
Oh, the motors speed through the gidya clumps
where the teamsters cut the way.
They don’t have to find a camping patch or muster
for half a day.
The drivers look with a take-in glance at the line
of waggons still;
And every teamster wonders why he must hang to
Charleville.
So the petrol carts with their throbs and thrums
go slick on their easy way,
While the teamsters camp on the Warrego .and hope
for .a job to pay.
And the petrol swells, with their blasts of scorn for
the transport pioneers,
Swank past where the teamsters sit and brood and
spit out their unshed tears.

Mr. Geo. Langley, of River Farm, Albion Park, writes,

“My experience with C'VANOGAS (Calcium Cyanide) is that
it kills every rabbit in the burrows no matter how large
the burrows are. I have dug the rabbits out of my farm
(200 acres). I used the 51b. I bought
from you in the largest burrows, and after
digging out the smaller ones I decided to

commend it to anyone that wants to get
rid of rabbits.”

ease the pain, some were drowned. Another plant
beside bracken which will alleviate the irritation of
nettle stings is dock, the juice from the crushed
leaves of which soothes instantaneously. Luckily
this herb is usually found growing among or close
to nettle beds. But the stings inflicted by the
hair-like spikes which frost the undersides of the
broad leaves of the nettle-tree are far worse than
an ordinary dose from the nettle plant, and will
drive cattle or horses almost mad.

“Soda”: Tell “Merton” (B. 4/2/’26) that
the breeding of frogs will take a lot of doing.
They absolutely refuse to propagate in captivity.
Not only I, who have
(had considerable ex-,
perience with the am-
phibian, but every uni-
versity medical school
in Australia has pati-
ently tried to “en-
courage the breeding
of frogs.” It won’t
work. You might con-
trive the most delight-
fully natural environ-
ment for your frogs,
then count them, and,
coming back in a year,
find fewer of the kind
there than when you
started. Melbourne
University buys its
frogs ‘ for biological
work from local lads.
The average price is
4d. per head, but I
have known it to rise
to a bob when exams,
were nigh and supplies
1o w. Frequently I
have known the
medical school to
transfer its attention
to the dissection of
brer rabbit because of
the scarcity of Hyla
aurea. The man who
can “encourage the
breeding of frogs”
with success has a for-
tune coming to him
from young medical
students and the ’var-
sities. If these cus-
tomers, who use thou-
sands a year, cannot,
with the zoologists at
the back of them,
breed frogs, then
"Merton” won’t have
a hope. Moreover, the
Australian green frog
will not even eat whilst
kept in captivity.
There are isolated cases
of domesticated frogs,
but in such cases you’ll
find only one frog, not a family.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum": The mango, once a
valuable asset to orchardists on the coast of Central
Bananaland, is now, except in an odd instance or two,
a fruit of no account from a commercial point of
view. It is so easily grown that it runs wild in some
parts. One large tree will produce more than enough
fruit for any ordinary household. This season there
is an exceptionally heavy crop, which is rather later
than usual in ripening, owing to the trees haying
cast the first two crops set. a not uncommon happening.
As there is no market worth while—values range
from Is. to 2s. a bushel case, a price that \voui4
barely pay for the containers —growers will be com-
pelled to feed the greater part to the pigs or stack
it outside the orchard and burn it. As a dearth of
mangoes generally follows a bumper crop, the fruit
is likely to be scarce next summer. But that won’t
cause any particular weeping among growers.
* * * *
“Werrimee”: Old Jack Bandy, who cir-
culated in the Warrego and Barcoo country, was the
only swagman I ever met who carried pyjamas. At
least, that was what he called the things that he
put on at bedtime. He had made them himself.
The hips of the pants and the shoulders and arms
of the coat were padded with wool. They were
practically his bed, for they served him as well as
a mattress or hippers on the hardest ground. On
hot nights he usually spread them under himself,
but in cold weather he sometimes put the bed on over
his track clothes, and, instead of dressing when
he got up in the morning, he partly undressed.
* vi- * *
“Bouragi”: As something of an anthro-
pologist in my spare time, the theory (B. 11/2/’26)
that white women living in China sometimes bear
slant-eved children as a result of gazing on the
multitudinous Mongol leaves me cold. I once heard
something of the sort, advanced as a defence by
the female respondent in a N.Q. divorce case, where
a Chinaman was cited as co-re. The lady stoutly
denied infidelity, and, when asked to account for
the jaundiced complexion of her last infant, thought
it might have been due to looking at the lemons
in the window of her husband’s fruit-shop.
* * * *
“Ratio”: The old lie again, told by the
Edinburgh Scotsman, which doesn’t know any better,
and reprinted by the Argus, which does or ought to:
“Australia is without the singing birds which are a
feature of our own country, but what the feathered
population lacks in music it atones for by beauty of
form and brilliance of color.” A member of the
Australian Literary Association said recently that
“we are too much given to shouting our many
excellences abroad”; the persistence of such hoary
mj'ths as songless birds, scentless flowers, monotonous
gum-tree scenery and huge unexplored tracts indi-
cates that we do not shout loudly enough. A
department for the Explosion of Myths is a pressing
necessity.
* * * *
“Atherton”: What are the cheapest, best
and easiest hobble straps to make where a big string
of packhorses is concerned? Greenhide fills the bill
in the North. Long strips liin. wide, cut
circle-wise off a hide, will make many straps. It
is an expensive mistake and a waste of time to
rivet buckles to each strap. The Cape York Penin-
sula “nigger’s head” knot is quickly made and fully
answers the purpose of a buckle, besides doing away
with the frequent curse of a jarnbed buckle tongue.
Cut each strap at least 4in. longer than the necessary
length, roll one end up very tightly for 4in., then
push the knife blade right through the centre of
the fold. Thin the strap end, shove the point
through, and pull the strap completely through.
This means the complete strap is passed through a
slit far smaller than itself, which forces the knot
into a compact knob. The tighter you pull, the
more pronounced becomes the knob. To fasten it
around the hoof, cut a small slit lin. distant from
the strap end and then force the big knot through.
It catches “automatically.” Make all slits very
small, as in long-grass country on dewy nights the
hide straps become very wet and the holes enlarge
as the strap itself stretches, thus making the knot
liable to be jerked away. That is the main fault
with greenhide—stretching when wet. Make each
hobble-strap of double length, then double it in the
centre to make one strap, which of course, makes
it doubly strong. Another method, but less quick
and effective, is to cut one slit in a greenhide end
and two slits in the other end. Pass the strap
around Baldy’s hoof, then run the double-slit end
through the single-slit end and push a wooden peg
into the two slits, thus clinching the strap. The
peg must be nicked to prevent it falling out. But
the pegs take time and patience to make, and fall
out easily on a wet or dewy night. I saw very
good and strong hobbles made from a used motor-
tyre. Rut motor-tyre straps need buckles. And
when a sandalwood-getter has 40 pairs of hobbles
to fix each night, he wants his material handy and
cheap, otherwise at the year’s end leather, buckles,
rivets, tools, time and labor are going to cost him
a small fortune in repairs. If leather straps are
used, a periodical greasing gives them double life.

“Vic Emma”: Can any Abo.-ite come to
my assistance? My trouble is Johnson grass. The
Queensland Agricultural Department advises me that
there is no known exterminator of it. I have an
area of half an acre of it in the middle of my
maize paddock. What am I to do to get rid of it?
The beastly stuff has half-inch-thick runners down
2ft. 6in., so that I cannot dig it out.
* * * *
“Merris”: The largest cabbage in the
world, according to a friend up there, has been
grown in the homestead garden of a cattle-run about
60 miles from Tarcoola (S.A.). It was -2ft. 6in.
high and 30in. in diameter, and weighed nearly two
hundredweight. My friend says that it was as
tender as a young lettuce.
“Angora” : The blackberry pest, which is
causing much anxiety in many parts of Australia,
isi difficult to cope with. Digging it out has
sometimes to be resorted to. My own experience is
that the plain or garden variety of goat is the
cheapest and most effective remedy. Even when
good grass is available, Nan prefers the fibrous
blackberry. Fifty goats would keep 100 acres of
badly-infested country clean. Angoras are equally
effective; and as good Angoras cut about 61b. of
“wool” worth about the same price as crossbred,
they should prove a profitable side-line, especially
as rich but infested land can be got mighty cheap.
* * * *
“Slam”: The American beaver doesn’t do
much better than its fellow-rodent the Australian
nest-building rat of the east coastal bush. I have
seen nests 4ft. across and at least 3ft. high, contain-
ing five chambers housing five separate families.
The average fortress is smaller, and may contain
two or three rooms only. The little grey rats
work only at night, bringing sticks and little
branches for the structure, which no dog can pene-
trate nor demolish. By the way, this bush rat,
although it hops in kangaroo fashion and has its
hind legs much longer than the fore pair, is not
a marsupial, but one of our few “higher” animals.
THE TELL-TALE BIRD.
“Oh, Jack dear, I wish you wouldn’t use
such dreadful language in front of the
parrot!”
“C.Q.”: How far can a bush-fire jump?
Ex-Sergeant Mackay, late of Poster (Gippsland), started
fighting the demon that careless cockies and feckless
campers annually let loose upon the land as far back
as ISSS. When he rode at breakneck speed to
warn the settlers of the approach of the terror in
1898, he saw the fire he was running from gain on
and pass him in leaps of one and sometimes, he
swears, three miles at a time. Huge halls of burn-
ing bark, carried on a hurricane of w 7 ind, jumped
from the crests of 200 ft. trees clean across wide
gullies.
PLAIN BOUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sandhills lie like crimson buoys
Afloat in a sea of haze;
They rise and fall on a phantom tide
That runs through the hot, still ways.
The dying saltbush spreads and spreads
As far as the eye can see;
There’s a clear-cut line where sky meets earth
With never a hill or tree.
I’d give it all for one tree-clad hill
With a leaf-fringed crown on high—
Blue gums and white and kurrajongs
Or oaks "where the night-winds sigh,
Or a reed-fringed swamp where wild ducks mate
And the brood finds safe retreat,
And black swans sit on their floating nests
Under stars that are cool and sweet.
1 long for the sound of a busliman’s axe
And the purr of a crosscut saw
While grey dust flies from its gleaming teeth,
As sharp as a tiger’s claw;
Where parrots screech in the boughs by day,
And ’possums climb by night,
Where the jackass joins in the magpies’ song'
At the first grey streak of light.
At night I dream of the rugged hills,
With gullies deep between,
Where swift streams run to the dams below
And the grass is always green,
Where the tracks of the sheep wind in and out
By ways that are boulder-strewn,
And moss grows thick on the fencing-posts
And rails that are roughly-hewn.
I sniff the scent of damp gum-leaves
And I hear the rain-storm’s woush,
With splash and trickle on branch and bole,
As it breaks through the waiting bush ;
And I see the eddying water race
Down the track that leads past home,
While here and there is a snow-white mound
And the ruts are capped with foam.
The pepper-trees by our door have gone;
They’ve withered off one by one.
The creeper hangs like a net of twine
In the burning rays of the sun.
There’s a pile of sand on the western side
Of the horse-yard fence by the shed ;
And fissures gape in the gilgai holes
Where the lignum-stalks are dead.
There’s never a shade on the dull-grey plain
(They will tell you the soil is black) ;
But the whirlwinds rise like uneasy ghosts
And the dust is grey on the track.
The only rest for the eyes is night,
For there’s ever a glare by day,
And the sky dips down like a blue-grey lid
Till the world itself seems grey.
N.s.w.
JIM GRAHAME.


they started right!
Many thousands of motorists are pleased that the
new cars they bought some 12 months back were
equipped with Dunlop tyres.
HERE’S what one of many country
car Agents has to say re this matter.
WE ENQUIRED—“How is it that you have not obtained the
replacement tyre trade on the Dunlop equipped cars sold
by you late in 1924 and early in 1925?
HIS REPLY— “For the simple reason that the “Dunlops”
have not worn out yet. I’m in direct touch with these
motorists, and it will be many months yet before they
require new tyres. You can be certain they will be
Dunlops! ” ♦ » *
That’s why the motor trade like to equip their new cars with Dunlop tyres
they know they will be free of trouble in that respect, and their patrons will
be well satisfied with the tyre service rendered. It’s the same with the owner-
driver, he appreciates the uniform high standard of the “Dunlop,” and the
great mileage they give, and keeps on buying them. These facts coupled
with the reasonable price at which Australian made
D
D
are procurable at garages is keeping our huge mills—the largest m the
Southern Hemisphere—working day and night to cope with the demand
for more Dunlops. Fit them and you will be satisfied!

The Orient Co.’s 20,000-ton liner carried a
full cargo of jollity and happiness on Mon-
day when the Otranto ball swelled the Hos-
pital Saturday funds and gave the young-
sters who live in Woolloomooloo a chance
to come along and cheer the “quality” who
rolled up in motor-cars and sigh a few “alls”
of compassion for the beautifully-attired
flappers who came by Shanks’s pony. Tickets
had mentioned a Circular Quay berthing, and
a few score went to the old location and wan-
dered around looking for a policeman to put
them on the right track. When they did
arrive at Woolloomooloo the assurance of
the committee that the change of address
had been in the daily papers did not allay
their wrath. Most of them denied ever
reading daily papers, and only simmered
down when the orchestra tuned up “Show
Me the Way to Go Home.”
Mrs. Arthur Jewett, one of the organisers,
kept; moving to see that the bifldge and mail
jongg players were comfortable. Her tall
slenderness was draped in metal brocade in
a small dark-toned pattern. Mrs. Norman
Murray, her right bower, in a gown of jade
and gold lace, was on the dancing deck.
She brought a good-looking nephew, Clifford
Roberts, from S. Australia. Annie Evans, of
Anzac Buffet memories, had a bevy of girls
selling balloons, cigarettes and sweets. Pretty
golden-haired Judy Coombe was among the
lasses in a black-and-silver frock, and sister
Vera was in flowered georgette. Margaret
Osb'orne also hawked a tray between dancing
the Charleston. This new dance gives the
impression that tin 1 performers are stepping
on hot bricks. Mrs. Arthur Eedy. hon.
treasurer, not a bit, abashed at the thought
of all the calculation ahead of her, smiled
over the big company in a gown of midnight
blue georgette shimmering with bronze beads,
Mrs. A. Eakin, the hon. sec., and Mrs. J.
Hogarth, her assistant, agreed that the re-
sult was worth all their hard work. Doctors
and their wives were legion, and those who
did not step it out in jazz did a bit of stepping
around the luxurious liner examining the
state cabins and picking a berth for a trip
to Europe.
Dr and Mrs. Dan Kelly had in their
company Mrs. Andreas, whose diamond
bracelet, two inches wide, had a scin-
tillating match with the beads and sequins in
the vicinity, and won. Her two smart daugh-
ters wore the latest Paris cut of hair (the
trio just back from a long sojourn in Paris),
and the newest Paris evening-gown. Mar-
jorie w!is_ in black velvet, cut in the new
“moulded" style, and studded on the edges
with steel point-beads; Lucie’s more girlish
frock was of faint orchid georgette, skirt
very short and full, bodice long and tight
and decorated with bright bead roses in full
blooming. Mrs. John. McKelvey looked charm-
ing in georgette shaded from deepest rose
to faintest pink. The shaded and moulded
frocks were a feature ; and so were coiffures,
which ranged from heads sleeked down to
the wooden Dutch style, with ears standing
quite naked and unashamed, to Eton. near-
Eton, shingles, bobs and long hair dressed
high, low and Grecian. One lass draped
her locks exactly as Galli Curd dressed hers,
but wore a cluster of poppies instead of the
Spanish comb.
The Otranto when she left yesterday looked
as if a dancer had never polished her decks,
perhaps because a couple of sailors kept
busy with brooms among the jazzers on Mon-
day night. The leviathan liner not only
takes our cricketers, but a big percentage of
our .squattocracy, including Dangars and
Falkiners; the Manchees of Moree and their
daughters; Dr. and Mrs. Clive Single
(Moree) ; Le Souef, lord of Taronga Park,
and Mrs. Le Souef. There is a little Parlia-
rfientary group, too, including Dr. Evatt and
his wife; the former is heading for the
Privy Council, to take Joynton Smith’s side
in his long argument with T. E. Rofe, for
whom Holman is the Australian counsel. At
Melbourne Lady Helena Rous will join the
trippers.
The naval trainees could not recognise
the Rushcutters Bay depot on Friday night
so beflagged and lantern-lit was it for a
dance arranged to relieve the tedium of teach-
ing recruits how to run the King’s navee.
Commander Quick was the hero of the enter-
tainment for his comic nautical sketch
printed on the programmes, which were much
sought after as souvenirs. His lady smiled
proudly over his artistic success in a gown
ot sapphire georgette with a red rose snug-
gling on her left shoulder, and helped her hus-
band receive the. guests. Mrs. George Earp
came with son-in-law and daughter, Com-
mander and Mrs. Rednall; Commander Wat-
son brought his girlish wife in black drap-
eries ; tall and slender Florence Brown low in
a trock of mauve floral georgette was with
her sister, Mrs. Evan Williams; and Capt.
and Mrs. Edgell and Major and Mrs. Selby
were among the naval and military lights who
enjoyed the jazz.
A delightful social interlude of last week
was the dance given by the directors of the
Australian Oriental Line on the new Taiping.
Exotic amaryllis, fragrant roses and bright-
nuea asters decorated the lounge, music and
dining saloons. A golden ship, spilling with
exquisite roses, held pride of place on the
principal supper-table. The main deck was
enclosed with flags for dancing, and under a
canopy of flags glowing Chinese lanterns
were swayed by the soft night’s breeze in
which smiling hosts F. N. Yarwood, Ivo
Clarke and Captain Hamilton welcomed the
guests. . The dressing was worthy of the
decorations. Mrs. Ivo Clarke’s .green gown,
scattered over with wonderful beaded roses,
was a summer symphony. Doris Yarwood’s
turquoise georgette scintillated with crystals.
1. It- Bavin turned his mind from political
cares to escort his lady, in black and silver
furnishings. The A. B. Shands brought
along Eileen and Ethel. The Leo Quicks
paid the Navy s compliments to the merchant
service, and Colonel and Mrs. Spain added a
military flavor.
Bowlers easily succumb to the allure of
‘‘'L o . l ' l § Te cn lawns, and Sydney has been
ottering hospitality to enthusiasts from every
Mate, Maoriland and Fiji. They arc all
iarnily men, apparently, and seem to make
the sporting tour the occasion for a holiday
for wives and daughters. For the ladies
accompanying the party Mrs. .Tames Wall,
wife of the president of the N.S.W. Bowling
Association, gave a delightful party at the
Wentworth. The company numbered' 300, and
Mrs. Gordon Gartrell, Mrs. W. J. Humphreys
i Mrs " 81ll § in helped to register the hand-
shakes. The guests enjoyed the cabaret
turns mightily. The Warringah Club also
did honor to the visitors at its own rooms.
The ladies accompanying the visiting bowl-
ing teams were guests at the opening of the
Warringah Croquet Club’s season last week.
I hose w T ho did not wish to play or to look

selves with bridge and mah jongg.
Numbers of people who have never seen
the face looking out from this page are well
acquainted with the voice of Kathleen Crack-
nel], which has come to them regularly on
the wireless
waves sent out
by 2FC; and
rliey have
blessed it for
it s unusual
clarity. She
owns a rich
contralto which
she can send
wandering over
two octaves;
Clara Butt
said such nice
things about
it, and especi-
ally of its sym-
pathetic qual-
ity, that the
young singer
can’t help
dreaming
dreams. But
she differs from
most others in having no desire to go abroad.
Her book is well filled with engagements,
especially for Scots’ gatherings (Scotch folk-
songs are her specialty, and James Brash,
conductor of the Highland Society’s Choir,
is her tutor), and she is satisfied with the
opportunities this land of sunshine affords
her. She is a Burwood girl.
April will be a gay month. Myriad balls
are being discussed, and the smart dancing-
floors are being booked up briskly. The Kari-
tane Committee has booked April 7, the
Adult Deaf and Dumb Auxiliary will have
a dinner-dance on April 12. There will be
Nellie Stewart’s matinee for the Radium
Needle Fund, and the Greek Community ball
for the Children’s Hospital.
Sydney Jewry paid its annual tribute to
the chief heroine of the race at the end
of last week when the feast of Purim was
observed. Purim celebrates the culminating
point in the story of Esther—the salvation
of the Israelites from destruction; it is
entirely a festival of rejoicing, an occasion
on which, according to the old Rabbis,
drunkenness was excusable, and Purim
parties are held as a regular part of the
celebrations. The one religious ceremony
is the reading of the Megillah. or Scroll of
Esther, in the Synagogue, and it is quite the
right thing to applaud when the names of
Esther and Mordecai are mentioned. The
feature of this year’s celebration was the
wonderful intoning of the MegiUah by the
Rev. A. I). Wolinski, one of the retired minis-
ters of the congregation and father of the
Australian artist—a man who carries the
weight of fourscore years. He did it, too,
without a reference to the long script.
February maintained its wedding record
to the last. Pearl Gannon, daughter of the
late well-beloved Jim, K.C., was married to
Denis Mooney, of Randwick, at St. Mary’s
Cathedral by Father Bond. The bride was
in blushing pink from her soft tulle veil to
the tip of her satin shoes, and her arms
held a cluster of pink lilies. Her cousin,
Bronzie Clonin, made a charming color con-
trast in a frock of delphinium-blue and silver.
Tom Flattery was second-best man, and
auntie Clonan was hostess at the Ambas-
sadors.
This vivid and earnest face belongs to the
wife of Dr. Dark, of Katoomba, and the
daughter of the late Dowell O’Reilly, who
wrote some of the most appealing prose ever
produced in
Australia and
joined to rare
talents a beau-
tiful character.

true literary genius. Mrs. Dark has this
past year or so. written, some of the cleverest
stories and verse that have appeared in The
Bulletin and the Woman’s Mirror, and
one of her novels is at the moment in the
hands of a London publisher.
Mr. and Mrs. H. A. Freeman came down
from Gunnedah to give daughter Eileen to
Rex Millar, of Mosman. The Presbyterian
Church saw the nuptials, padre D. P. Mac-
Donald officiating. Eileen was also a pink-
clad bride. Sister Lorn a, in mauve, and Mar-
jorie Ford, in powder-blue, bridesmaided,
their partners being Clive Trollope and
Stephen Freeman. Felicitations followed at
the Mosman Masonic Hall.
Jill Snfipe and Reginald Robinson, second
son of C. C. Robinson, of Tatala, North
Sydney, are heading for matrimony. The
bride-elect is the daughter of Mrs. J. G.
Snape, of Woodlawn, Quirindi, and a grand-
daughter of the late John Arthur Macart-
ney, of Waverley and Diamantina Lakes
stations (Q.).
On an evening of last week, when Pearl,
daughter of the late W. M. C. Moore, of
"Woolwich, left St. Andrew’s Cathedral, she
was changed into Mrs. William Henry Tre-
weeke, and had the younger son of .T. W.
Treweeke, of Barren Junction, for a hus-
band. The bridal trappings were vellum
georgette, silver tissue and Limerick lace.
Jean and Marjorie Moore fitted the brides-
maids’ job in pretty nasturtium-tinted frocks
trimmed with gold lace and struck a gorgeous
color-note by carrying warm-blue delphini-
ums. Good healths were drunk at the Wara-
tah Cafe.
At St. Thomas’s Church, North Sydney,
Winifred Woodley was married to John Sel-
wyn. Robinson, son of the late Captain Alex.
Robinson.. The bridal gown of brocade, en-
crusted with silver beads and trained with
white tulle poised on pink georgette, was
lovely. The bridesmaids, Eileen Shay and
Eileen Forster, wore georgette frocks shaded
from faintest to deepest rose, and rose-tinted
veils. Mrs. Woodley received the wedding
company at the Ambassadors.
The visiting M.L. and inter-State swim-
mers were the guests of the Randwick and
Coogee Ladies’ Swimming Club at an after-
noon party at the Wentworth last week. Ena
Stockley and Piri Page, the heroines of the
recent swimming carnival, were given posies
of red and mauve, and the M.L. colors also
decorated their tea-table. The Victorian
visitors had blue favors on their table, and
the Queenslanders the gay scarlet of their
team.
Miss S. J. Williams, principal of the Uni-
versity Women’s College, is back from
her tour of the world. Her wanderings took
her _ through England, France, Germany,
Belgium, Switzerland and North America. In
tevery country she visited women’s colleges
are attached to the universities, and of them
all she found most to admire at the American
colleges. These luxurious institutions pro-
vide large facilities for sport and outdoor
exercise, so that the students’ physical de-
velopment may keep pace with that of their
minds. Nor is beauty-culture entirely
neglected; in several of the colleges Miss
Williams saw electric hot-air machines for
the girls to dry their hair after a shampoo.
While the very youngest Australian citizen
was testing his voice in the hospital proper,
Health-Minister Cann was lifting his up in
the grounds of the Royal Hospital for
Women, Paddington, announcing to the
annual meeting of the Benevolent Society
that the Government would subsidise up to
£oo,ooo the cost of constructing a new wing.
The work, to cost £60,000, will begin in a
couple of months. The Paddington hospital
is most worthy, but also most modest
in voicing its claims to the well-
placed citizen’s generosity. It is the
kindliest haven for the really poor,
where the impoverished mother gets exactly
the same consideration as the citizen who
is glad to pay for the obstetric skill of nurses
and special medicoes. Pre-maternity pro-
blems are solved, too, for many weary mothers,
who know that the wee mites of the family
will be well cared for at Scarba, Bondi, while
little brothers and sisters are arriving. Dur-
ing the year 1841 little Australians greeted
the light of the world in the hospital. Among
the eulogists of the institution and its kindred
charities were politicians Dan Levy and ,T. E.
West, Archdeacon Boyce and Canon Charl-
ton. The Police Band played a tune each
time the speakers paused for breath.
Sydney Hospital held its annual meeting
on Friday afternoon, and the hearts of sup-
porters were lightened by the more cheerful
report of bon. treasurer Charles Garland.
Health Minister Cann presided, and pro-
mised more sympathetic Government support.
Archbishop Kelly lent his dignified presence
and lauded the honorary service that had
carried the hospital through over a century,
and the ladies’ auxiliary got. hosannas for
good work done during the past year.
Australia’s eminent Bertram Mackennal
and his lady of the radiant smile arrived in
time to spend the week-end in Sydney. It is
25 years since _ they were last here, and
they were not given a second to look around
and plan, for friends overwhelmed them with
greetings and besieged them with invitations.
The sculptor managed time to go and see the
placement of his Sliakspearean group outside
the. Mitchell Library; and as the ink is
drying on these columns the Institute of
Journalists is drinking the toast of the great
artist and his spouse at Farmer's.
Kathleen Fitzhardinge, well known in
golfing circles, has mentioned her engagement
to Wilfred Sheppard, a barrister on the ris-
ing tide of briefs in Sydney. The lass is the
youngest treasure of the Moreton Fitz-
hardinges, of Strathfield. Uncle is the Judge.
Miss Brisbane tells of a giddy whirl: —
Charlie Chauvel deserted picture production this
week to be best man at his brother Temple’s wedding
to Louie King, of the Kilmorna Kings. Temple
Chauvel is son of Major and Mrs. Allan Chauvel,
Stanthorpe. St. Stephen’s, Coorparoo, saw the glad
event. The bride wore ivory georgette over pale
pink, her veil was fastened with orange blossoms
and she carried white asters. Jean King and Margery
Armstrong ’maided in pale blue with white hats.
Mrs. King, wearing black marocain, had a reception
amidst mauve and pink asters.
For Daphne Gaukrodgor, who is soon to wed E.
Gallagher, of Blackall, Eileen Morgan had a party at
Dunoon, Toowong. She wore mauve georgette, and
the guest of honor was in ivory. Gerberas decked
the reception-rooms, and those bidden to the mah
jongg and bridge tables included Mrs. Ken Dalzell,
Mrs. O. Palmer, Nora Halford (just back from
abroad), Enid North, Jean Graham, Binnie Marlay
and Peggy Dods.
C. V. Hives, who leaves with his daughter this
week for England by America and Paris, had a
presentation from the Australian Sugar Producers’
Association. Senator Crawford handed out a silver
cigarette-case and matchbox, and produced a writing-
case for Miss Cecil Hives, and many verbal bouquets.
Another off to the Cold Country is Mrs. A. H.
IVhittingham, who collected many friends at a fare-
well party at Lemon’s. The flowers were a marvel.
The fountain in the palm court was filled with mauve
water-lilies and fern; gay-hued gerberas and the
friendly gum-tips were lavishly used in the lounge:
Dorothy Perkins and Oxleans roses, with rose-hued
caladiums and pink African daisies and a backing
of autumn-hued and gold zinnias and water-lilies
were used in the ballroom. Rosewood crgpe de Chine
with bioideiies and a hat of malacca color with
ospreys sheathed the hostess.
Arthur Hobbs, the -well-known solicitor, went out
very suddenly. He had been engaged at Court in
the morning, lunched at his club, and in the after-
noon went home and seated himself in an easy
chair on his verandah at Ascot, to die immediately.
His wife was one of Brisbane’s beauties, Meta
Mui-ray-Prior. Bartie Hobbs, his only son, has just
left for Maoriland. Alice, the only daughter, is now
Mrs. Robinson, of Dalby.
Mayor Jolly presided over the meeting of the
Self-Aid-for-the-Blind Society. Membership totals
60, and many blind members are receiving tuition
in music and singing. Edwin Dickinson gained the
A.T.C.L., and Harold Dickinson passed the senior
Trinity College of Music exam. Socials and dances
are held weekly, and now more i-oom is needed.
Hon.-sec. J. Shaw said the financial year was good,
street collections and donations having realised more
than £lOOO.

The first day of the V.R.C. Autumn Meet-
ing at Flemington was a diets irae of sen-
sational defeats, depleted purses and shat-
tered hopes. All gaiety and gladness dropped
out of the afternoon when Manfred glued
himself to the barrier and the wonder-horse
Top Gallant was beaten. The erratic
Heroic’s win in the Newmarket only added
to the gloom. Still, all nature smiled, and
the scene was gay enough. The lawns pre-
sented a bright parade of color, the sun
shining upon brilliant-hued parasols, vivid
hats —mainly of felt with brims upturned—
and vivid frocks. A cool breeze tempered
the sunshine, and the crowd represented all
Australia.
Lady Stradbroke, escorted by his Ex., wore
a dog-collar of pearls and many ropes of the
same upon a severely plain black frock,
topped by a small tulle-trimmed hat. Several
folk were bidden to share the midday repast
with them. Daughter Helena was cool-look-
ing in cream silk with crinoline millinery
of lime hue, bearing water-lilies. Colonel
Watson struck a festive note in the special
enclosure by displaying a straw hat with a
sporty green-and-red band.
Dressing was ’tween . seasons. A few,
anxious to be first in, put on the woollen
fabrics and fur of the winter, but the summer
vogue was generally affected, with the addi-
tion of lightweight furs and coats. Mrs.
Alan Currie was smart in a natural kasha
suit, worn with a brown hat. Mrs. C. Angas
(S.A.) was quite regal—a study in royal
purple from hem of gown to top plume of
headpiece. A hat of ruched silk, crushed
strawberry hue, with elevated brim and a
pendant feather, gave an up-to-the-minute
touch to the floral chiffon apparel and black
coat of Mrs. Leslie McDonald. Zeerust
Clarke (Tas.) was among the good-lookers,
sporting henna and black check raiment.
Mrs. Alec Russell was very attractive in
fawn crepe georgette with fur of the same
hue, and dull gold roses supporting a side
flare. Her felt hat was in unison.
There was such a dearth of competition for
the Australasian Gold Cup at the polo tourna-
ment that play lasted only two afternoons,
after which the Governor-General’s lady
passed over the goblet to Captain W. R.
Cumming, of the Victorian A (Caramut)
team and gave wee silver replicas to the four
players. The finals were fought out in
weather which bred fears of further bush-
fires. The wind was hot and strong, and
dust rolled in billows. Society rolled
in cars, but even within the cushioned
depths of the longest of limousines the
amount of comfort obtainable was not
worth writing home to mother about. The
dressing was rather mixed, the weaker vessels
having so many elements to provide for. They
covered airy frocks with light coats that
added to the heat, and upturned felt millinery
of the moment necessitated taking full ad-
vantage of the shade of the parasol. Her
Ex., following the fashion, appeared in a
jumper-suit of Cream silk, worn with the
conventional pleated skirt and a Pandan hat
with band of floral ribbon. The Prime
Minister’s lady wore a black hat of the
shade-giving order above draperies of black
georgette. About the prettiest of the
younger set was Cassie Connolly, of Westra-
lia. whose fresh complexion was set off by
a black lace hat and rose-patterned georgette
gown.
Ten polo teams, representing South Aus-
tralia and Victoria, are wrestling for the
Stradbroke Cup, at Moonee Valley. The
State Governor, with daughter Helena in
ivory crepe de Chine and black hat, rolled
up early to view the play. During the lull
for afternoon refreshment a number of
society folk joined the vice-regal party for
tea in a rustic shelter adjoining the ring. The
fair followers of the game mostly adopt a
sporting style of dress, and the younger set
and the more slimly-built matrons are posi-
tively glorying in the jumper suit, which
promises to be killed by too much popularity,
like the upturned felt hat, which is already
on the road to its obsequies.
Chatelaines of Western pastures to the
number of 26 made themselves hostesses
of one of the best-engineered dances ever
held in St. Kilda Town Hall. The show was
part of the polo tournament celebrations, and
intended chiefly to honor competitors and
visitors from over the Western border. It
was a well-gowned gathering subtly reflecting
both the placidity and the wealth of the
broad acres in which the fortunes of the
guests have their roots. A suggestion of
bush sunshine was conveyed by festoons of
primrose-shaded lights glimpsed between gar-
lands of greenery and yellow roses and
drapings of the same hues. The event cele-
brated was recalled in groupings of polo-
sticks, teams’ colors and wreaths of laurel.
Many of the matrons were uncommonly
attractive—slim, good-looking and showing
their natural complexion, and with the poise
and confidence born of assured social status.
The younger generation was represented in
flocks, equally sure, equally well dressed, but
hardly as fascinating.
Early-Victorian posies, feather fans and
coiffure decorations of wreathed leaves,
golden and green, were incidental features
of the dressing. Lady Helena Rous was
there in mauve and crystal. Mrs. Jim Fair-
bairn, of Mount Elephant, who secretaried
the event, was in soft, faint-pink draperies
of georgette. Mrs. Ronald Cumming, of
Mortlake, had plumbago-blue apparel
sprinkled with crystal; Mrs. Angus Reid’s
was amber georgette and gold lace; Mrs.
Gordon Chirnside’s fair shingle was seen
above a white gown which had seismo-
graphically charted lines of glitter and jet;
Mrs. Ronald Angas put South Aus. promi-
nently on the map in her frock of hyacinth
hue with a sparkle of dewdrops. Several
maidens wore the close-fitting bodice and full
skirts of the latest fashion ; quite adorable
was a flare of sea-green chiffon edged with
grey fur which slipped from beneath a silver
lace top. Phyllis Holmes Hunt, a dainty,
dark-haired deb., had wee roses of silver
appliqued upon fairy fabric of white; and
Patricia Lempriere, who also was having her
first chukka, wore white with an after-
thought of silver. With a pink ribbon tying
her honny brown hair, and a white frock
punctuated with geranium-pink, Valerie
Purves was quite a good sample of a city
society lass; and. Margot Best fitted into
the same picture nicely with floral and gold
lace embellishing a frock of periwinkle-blue.
Pauline Watt, of Sydney, was long-sleeved
and wrapped in cinnamon-liued lace.
The craze for aureate bridal attire having
subsided, pink weddings are the thing.
When the choristers of All Saints’, St. Ivilda,
carolled about “The Voice that Breathed” in
honor of Clayre Perry, they did so amid
decorations of pink and white. The bride,
in a short frock of pink georgette beneath
silver lace and train and clouds of white
tulle, became Mrs. John Gubbins. Her
husband holds the station-lands of Kalmina.
Eric Connolly’s daughter Iris helped by
lending the train of her Court-presentation
gown. Four attendant maids wore early-
Victorian headgear of rose velvet with side-
knot of the same material and feather tips,
with apparel that kept within the color scheme.
Dr. Charles Perry and his wife collected
some 300 guests at No. 9 Darling-street, the
hostess wearing a gown and millinery that
blended the hues of falling leaves from flame
to nigger-brown. Many polo-tournament
visitors went along.
One-time Gallery student of Melbourne,
Stella Lewis, now Mrs. Montague Marks,
who has made
a front place
for herself
among mini-
ature-portrait
painters in the
dry republic
and England,
is here pic-
tured by the
D i c k i nson-
Mont e a t h
studio. II e r
work found
muc li favor
when shown
lately at the
New Gallery,
and several
c o mmissions
resulted. After
nearly 12
years’ absence
from Australia
she is sorry to have to pack her grip again
for the land of her adoption; but unless
business is too pressing, she must be off
with her husband and small daughter on
March 11.
The marriage of Marion, youngest
daughter of the late Angus Urqulnirt, of
Warwick, Camperdown, to William Ross
Armstrong, eldest son of the W. J. Arm-
strongs of Hexham Park, was roseate. The
bridal gown was of pale-pink georgette with
a top-dressing of silver lace, all overlaid by
a cloud of pink tulle attached to a wreath
of white heather. Four bridesmaids stepped
into the picture in petal flared frocks of the
same shade, crowned by gold-toned crinoline
straw millinery with dangling ribbons. The
ceremony at Scots’ Church was in a setting
of blooms to harmonise, and at No. 9 Dar-
ling-street Mrs. Urquhart’s black satin lace
and ospreyed hat had a background of pink
carnations as she gave greeting to the 200
or so guests. The wool and beef of the
western district have seldom been so fully
represented in one gathering.
Elsa Stralia was the lioness of the Austral
Salon’s latest musical tea, appearing in a
navy-blue gown, steel-beaded, with a fur-
collared wrap of black satin and swathed
headpiece. Mrs. Alfred Levi and daughter
Sara listened to kindly farewells on the eve
of their departure for a holiday in Europe,
and secretary Alice Richardson welcomed
Arnold Wardley and his wife, an English
couple on their way to Maoriland.
From Italy comes this picture of Fran-
cesca Duret, whose dulcet notes gladdened
Melbourne
audiences some
two and a half
years ago. A
nupil of A. C.
Bartleman, she
went to Milan,
where Maestro
Pizzi took her
in hand so suc-
cessfully that
eight months
afterwards she
made her
operatic debut
as Rosina in
“II Barbiere,'’
following this
up with a tour
of Italy. At
Milan she
appeared in
“ Lucia ” and
“La Sonnam-
bula,” a n d
latex - at the San Carlo Opera House in
Naples in “Elisir d’Amore.” Since then the
Aussie soprano has had offers of more en-
gagements than she can accept. She has
made about 50 appearances in the “Barber”
and recoi-ded her century in “Lucia.” Within
a period of less than three years abroad
she has acquired a repertoire of 22 operas.
Very flattering are Italian press references
to her work, and such praise in the most
musical country in the world, given to an
outsider, means much. The singer has
appeared in good company, too, for it was
with the great baritone Franci that she
sang in “Traviata” at La Scala. This month
she is starring in “Rigoletto” and other
operas in Bergamo. America has been call-
ing, but she is loath to leave the good friends
and kindly audiences of the home of opera.
In private life Francesca Duret is Mrs.
John Shepherd, her husband being an offi-
cer of the taxation department in this city.
Professor Laver, who has passed the Uni-
versity Conservatorium over to Bernard
Heinze, intends to lead the simple life on
his farm at Kinglake ; but bush-fires last week
very nearly reduced those plans to ashes, the
flames coming desperately close. On Satur-
day afternoons Mr. and Mrs. Laver bade
good-bye to staff and students at the Melba
Hall, and the old Prof, introduced his suc-
cessor, who, notwithstanding war service and
some years of musical study abroad, looks
very young—even younger than his age. Pro-
fessor Laver referred to the splendid services
of the late Marshall Hall in fostering orches-
tral music, and to Professor Peterson and his
fine educational methods. Mrs. Peterson's work
with her women’s choir and her help in the
building of the Melba Hall were also acknow-
ledged.
Nothing quite so effective and profitable
as the Queen Competition as a means of
raising money for charities seems to have
been yet invented. Such a venture has re-
cently enriched St. Vincent’s Hospital by
about £12,000. Of five candidates the lady
at the bottom of the poll brought in over
£llOO, while the winner handed in a cheque
for about £3500. Wirths’ Olympia saw the
coronation of the Queen of Charity, appro-
priately represented by Nurse Freda Fatzens,
of St. Vincent’s Hospital. The wee retainers
of Betty Willis, aged six, the Queen of
Schools, wore Kate Greenaway fi-oeks of
varied-lined taffeta and quaint poke bonnets.
Marie Maguire, the Queen of Sport, wore an
emerald welvet train attached to white spark-
ling raiment. Florence Smith was Queen of
the Postal Service and Irene Holloway repre-
sented “the workers.” Members of the Hos-
pital executive rewarded the young queens’
efforts with strings of pearls. The Mel-
bourne Symphony Orchestra, under Alberto
Zelman, played the incidental music.
Advance models of feminine winter wear
are mostly fur-trimmed, topcoats, capes and
even tailored suits being embellished in the
Eskimo style. The current of fashion, of
course, is too powerful to struggle against.
No matter how strongly one’s personal pre-
dilections may favor the plain and unfussed,
when the suit is being fitted or the wrap
selected at one’s elbow stands the tempter
with a piece of clipped pussy, bunny or ’pos-
sum, or whatever forms the basis of syn-
thetic fox, sable and ermine. The worst of
it is that the effect is usually irresistible—■
fur is a wonderful softener and blender—
and bang goes another 395. lid.
The State Governor and his lady motored
hundreds of miles on a recent day to find
out for themselves just how the hush-fires
have left the people of the afflicted districts.
A plentiful supply of smokes for the men
and jars of sweets for the women and child-
ren were taken out. After seeing for them-
selves the desolation and discussing matters
with sufferers, their Exes, made several prac-
tical suggestions regarding relief, and backed
these up with substantial donations to relief
funds.
Aid for bush-fire sufferers was produced by
the Women’s Automobile Club through a
bridge party. Mrs. Edgar Dye was respon-
sible for the effort, which was a smooth-
running top-gear affair. There were flowers
and sweets for sale, and an auction conducted
by Elsa Stralia swelled the proceeds.
The bush-fires have been responsible for a
practical revival of the wartime idea of
“adopting” devastated towns. Thus Sand-
ringham adopted Fumina, in the Noojee dis-
trict, and as a result is entertaining 43 re-
fugees. The local picture-shows and the
’buses are free to the suburbs’ guests, and
all have been taken into the homes of resi-
dents.
Yarrien, the Toorak home of the Harry
Creswicks, was the scene of the first jazzing
of the polo season. Hall and drawing-room
were generously decorated with seasonable
blooms, and the tables at supper were dolled
up in like manner. The hostess sparkled in
crystal, trailed over petunia-pink. Vice-
royalty was represented by Lady Helena
Rous in a dahlia-red gown with beads of the
same hue. Mrs. Jim Fairbairn, of Mount
Elephant, wore shaded draperies of hyacinth
tones. Mrs. Donald Moffatt, of Berrambool,
affected the same color in a darker shade.
Mrs. Eric Murray (S.A.), who is enjoying
the hospitality of the Creswicks during the
gay season, wore a gown of cobalt-blue.
There is a disturbing cable from London
about the intention of the Windsors to
severely prune the lists for next season’s
drawing-rooms, and people with a suspicious
turn of mind are connecting this with the
recent unprecedented bookings for the Big
Smoke. Since the war made so many for-
tunes, royal receptions have been so crowded
that the distinction of curtseying before the
monarch has lost a good deal of its social
value. Also, so many overseas visitors have
been insisting on a share in the show that
some of the British Vere de Veres have found
their old-established rights disregarded, and
there’s the rub. But where can the knife
be applied? Trade can’t nowadays be cast
into the outer darkness in which it used to
languish without putting a ban on half the
contents of Debrett and a substantial slice
of the Almanach de Gotha.
Mrs. Arthur Staughton. of Keayang, has
been missed from the festivities of the polo
season. Her husband, a keen player, met
with an accident when practising at his
station home a couple of weeks ago, and has
been in hospital here ever since. Mrs.
Staughton and her daughter Elizabeth are
standing by at the Ritz.
Sister Adelaide ranges over the long
State:—
The Bridges are back in town —at a Government
House still bereft of its western garden-wall and well
in range of the dust that eddies in clouds from King
William-road, which is still being widened. A
country trip or two, including one to Lameroo and
another to devastated Mt. Pleasant, have been their
Ex.’s chief engagements since they left the cool peace
of Victor Harbor.
Socially we are still somnolent —with fires and
rumors of fires to keep landholders constantly on
watch, and a postponement of rain that is making
even the gums in the Mt. Lofty Ranges look dreary.
A bridge and croquet party or two have been almost
the only ripples.
Peter Pan pipes now in our Botanic Gardens, too,
the replica of the Kensington Gardens statue having
duly arrived. Like the original, it is the work of
George Frampton, and is the gift of two Adelaideans
living in London.
From Darwin comes the news of the death of
Lady Coekburn Campbell, the daughter of Alfred
Giles, one of the best known of Northern Territory
pastoralists. She was a staunch believer in the
Territory, and had scant sympathy with the theory
that it is “impossible” for women. She could speak
from some experience, too, her home—Waterloo station
---being 50 miles from the nearest white woman, a
six days’ journey from Wyndham, the nearest town-
ship, and so well off the beaten track that visitors
were practically unknown. Gone west, too, is Mrs.
William Neill, a daughter of the late William Kyffin
Thomas of the Register. One of her sons is
Wilfred Neill, a mainstay of the Repertory Theatre.
With us for a few days is Miss Mary Chomley—
her mission to help us solve our domestic problem
by organising a definite scheme for getting woman
workers from overseas. Her headquarters have been
at Brighton, with Miss Russell and her sister, and
there was a brief visit to Victor Harbor by the
way.
Reka Grasby, back from three years’ musical study
in Europe, brings news of Australians overseas, among
them Helene Taylor, whose upper notes are now re-
ported to be almost faultless. Miss Grasby found a
slump in post-war enthusiasm for Australians in
English musical circles, and to her the hand extended
by Italians, French and Germans seemed far gladder
than the English fist.

Develop Australia Along Sound Lines.
Three Modern Financial Institutions
Combined Authorised Capital £6,500,000
DIRECTORS OF EACH COMPANY
SIR WILLIAM ELLIOT JOHNSON, K.C.M.G., M.H.R. (former Speaker Federal
House, Director Greater Sydney Development Company).
PERCY REGINALD HIGGINS, Barrister-at-Law, Phillip Street, Sydney (Chair-
man of Directors Australian Provincial Assurance Association, Chairman of Directors
Standard Portland Cement, Limited).
ALBERT CARLYLE WILLIS, Underwriter. Eldon Chambers. Pitt Street, Sydney
(former Manager Head Office London Bank, Sydney).
ROLAND HENRY CROSSING, Mudgee (formerly Senior Partner of Crossing
and Cox. Mudgee. Chairman of Directors of Company controlling the Crossing Interests
in New South Wales).
Solicitors: Messrs. Lawrence and Lawrence, New Zealand Bank Chambers, Sydney; Messrs. Robson and Cowlishaw, Phillip Street, Sydney.
Auditors: John Stewart and Co., Challis House, Sydney.
OBJECTS: To create three distinct Institutions, limited in Capital and Liability to their separate undertakings, but under the same direction
and control, which will combine commercial and exchange banking, fiduciary underwriting, investment, and other functions and
services necesary to progressive development.
The need of steady, systematic development of Australia’s resources is apparent to
everybody; but it is only those who have practical experience of it who can realise liow
essential to that development is the establishment of up-to-date financial institutions with
Australia’s general development as their main object.
Our present confused and unorganised financial conditions so continually impede
and so frequently defeat legitimate transactions and developments that a naturally enter-
prising people are held back and discouraged and our national growth is retarded.
Our whole future depends upon the improved financing of public, semi-public and
private enterprise, and the proper marketing of our products.
For these purposes entirely new institutions are urgently required. Those facilities
are now offered in the three separate yet interdependent and jointly-controlled organisa-
tions, which also offer an attractive field for investment. The proposals are neither
fanciful nor hastily conceived, but are based on successful modern methods, coupled with
a close study of Australian conditions.
There are no promoters’ or vendors’ shares in any of the companies, and no Shanes
have been or will be sold to any director or other individual otherwise than for actual
cash value.
The Capital Cities and Country Underwiters of Australasia Limited
Authorised Capital —£1,000,000
Divided into 1,000,000 Shares of £1 each.
OBJECTS: To assist general development by making private funds available through the use of modern methods to those communities, firms
and individuals who desire to carry out public and semi-public utilities or improvements or extensions to their business, with
increased return to lender or investor, satisfactory terms to borrower or user, and reasonable compensation to the Underwriters.
To arrange through new methods for longer time investments and loans than are at present customary in Australia.
A company with the avowed purpose and single object of materially assisting in the
general development of Australia and Australian industries.
These objects will be attained by the purchase of municipal and shire securities
issued to pay for public improvements, of whole issues of bonds, debentures or shares in
going concerns; by co-operating in every manner with the secondary producer and assisting
him in his financial difficulties; by acting as selling agents on commission of shares in
new or established concerns; by lending money for long periods on first mortgage on
country properties; by assisting to finance public improvements in country districts ; by
assisting to finance properly-organised co-operative institutions; by financing building
construction in metropolitan and country towns; by acting as organising managers in
bond and share issues; by acting as financial advisers to municipalities, shires, firms and
individuals.
There will be a special board of experts who will thoroughly scrutinise all securities
and proposals before they are handled by the company.
ALL SECURITIES PURCHASED WILL RE RESOLD TO THE GENERAL
PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF BONDS OF DENOMINATIONS FROM £5O UP-
WARDS.
This procedure ensures safe and profitable re-financing, and allows for the use of the
same capital many times over. It also gives the small investor a rare opportunity to
invest in different classes of sound securities.
Capital Cities and Country Bank of Australasia Limited
(A Modern, Progressive Banking Institution.)
Authorised Capital —£5,000,000
Divided into 1,000,000 Shares of £5 each.
OBJECTS: To transact a General Commercial and Exchange Banking Business, modelled on the lines of the most advanced banking ideas
in successful practical operation here and elsewhere.
The chief of several special service departments will be one to handle Trustee,
Executor and Agency business, a provcdly profitable class of business in Australia, and
one included in the operations of most of the large, progressive banks of the world.
In every way consistent with safety, this bank will co-operate with the other two
institutions. By so co-operating with the underwriting institution as a temporary
refinancing depot and security custodian, it will make the services of that institution
quicker and more elastic, besides earning profits for the bank. The bank will also assist
the Investment, Mortgage and Finance Company (the third company in this group) by
turning over to it any sound business, not strictly banking business, but deserving of the
assistance of private capital.
The bank’s policy will be to render all possible personal service, treating its patrons
as clients rather than as mere customers.
The Capital Cities and Country Investment, Mortgage and Finance
Company of Australasia Limited
Authorised Capital—£soo,ooo
Divided into 1,000,000 Shares of 10/- each.
OBJECTS: To create a clearing centre where available investment and loanable funds will be collected, recorded, and segregated into their
several classes according to the investors’ or lenders’ requirements, also where the current sound investment and borrowers’
securities will be recorded and classified, so that on the one hand the investment and loanable funds will be rapidly absorbed, and
on the other hand the sound investments and loans will be quickly taken up.
One of the important functions of this institution will be to bring money from abroad
for investment in sound Australian development schemes.
The money market is crowded with legitimate applicants for financial assistance in
developing established and inaugurating new industrial concerns; private individuals and
firms are continually seeking money on first and second mortgage, and local governments
have difficulty in obtaining funds for public improvements.
So scattered, indeed, are present financial resources that inquiries for funds for sound
propositions have to follow long and bewildering trails that often end in failure. The aim
of this company is so to gather together, disentangle and segregate the money that is
really available as to create a clearing centre where the investor or borrower will enjoy
all the advantages of quick action combined with safety and expert assistance.
The Investment, Mortgage and Finance Company will —always after expert examina-
tion —discount or loan or obtain private capital on commercial paper for a longer period
than is customary: it will lend on first or second mortgage or obtain private funds for
that purpose; it will act as principal or agent in regard to all classes of sound securities;
it will act as fiscal agent for foreign or local investors in Australian securities; it will
assist in the development of national secondary production ; and it will meet all other
sound financial demands which are not large enough to come within the scope of the
Underwriting Company.
Such combinations of financial functions and services by institutions owned and
controlled by the same shareholders have long been in successful operation in other parts
of the world, and have very materially assisted in the development of new and progressive
countries. That equally satisfactory results to all concerned can be obtained in Australia
there is no reason to doubt.
Already there have been appointed accredited representatives who will be glad to
explain the proposals in detail to all interested. Otherwise, if the form below is tilled in
and returned, a full prospectus will be forwarded to the inquirer.
The Directors of these Companies do not intend to start actual operations in any of the three companies until they have sufficient Capital
subscribed and paid-up to properly establish operations, and to warrant the complete confidence of the Public.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
After his smashing performance in the
V.A.T.C. Futurity Stakes, Top Gallant was always
favorite for the V.R.C. Nevymarket Handicap, and
at Flemington on Saturday his supporters accepted
6to 4 in a field of 22. It was a rotten price about
a horse with lOst. 21b., and it is all Collins-street
to a cocoanut that even a totalisator like the one
at Randwick—although that, owing’ to Government
extortion, is about: the most niggardly of its kind —-
would have quoted at least 2 to 1 for a win, with
your money returned for a place. Heroic and Per-
spective were second favorites at 10 to 1, while
Lausanne was 12 to 1 ; Lady Thrill, 14 to 1 ;
Fuji San, 16 ; Kawarra, Versine, Wai-Lu and Swift,
20; Valiard, 25; and the others from S 3 to 200
to 1. Heroic, who had drawn No. 12 marble, and
Swift, who was close to him, gave a little trouble
at the barrier, but the start was a good one, Heroic,
Top Gallant and Bairn (on the inside), Valiard
and Perspective (on the outside) getting away best.
After they had gone a furlong the favorite was
in front from Bairn, and he still led entering the
course proper from Kelso’s mare, with Yea Princess,
Heroic, Waranton, Perspective and Fuji San nearest
of the others. Fuji San headed the favorite about
two furlongs from home, but Heroic presently took
charge, and, though Perspective, Fuji San, Waran-
ton and Prince Tressady finished well, Kellow’s
erratic chestnut won in brilliant fashion by two
lengths from Perspective, who was three parts of
a length in front of Fuji San, with Prince Tressady
and Waranton next.
Heroic and Cairns, who rode him, got a great
reception from the crowd, a large number of whom
had given the chestnut another chance, and Kellow
and Holt wore the satisfied air of men whose
patience has at last been rewarded. It was certainly
a slashing performance to carry 9st. 81b. and run
the six in lmin. llfsec. —equal to Valiard’s time
last year—and his party will perhaps now give -
over the attempt to make Heroic a stayer. Per-
spective ran true as steel, and Fuji Sail made a
great effort, but the chestnut was too good on the
day. Top Gallant’s performance was too bad to be
tnie. He showed great pace for a few furlongs,
and it now seems that one race was enough for him
en the hurried preparation that he got. However,
if Paddy Wade sends him to Sydney and Lou
Robertson can produce him in his Futurity Stakes
form, Windbag, Heroic, Manfred and co.—Whittier
has probably finished his racing career —will be set
a great task in the All-Aged Stakes at Easter.
There were only four starters in the St. Leger.
Manfred was 6 to 1 on. with Belgamba 6 to 1
against, and Redshank and Ellaline 20 to 1. Man-
fred was in a piggish mood, and a cut with the
whip only made him more unruly. When he con-
descended to face the barrier, and the machine lifted,
he wheeled round and unseated Tooliey. Naturally
he took no part in the race. Belgamba ran to the
front soon after the start and stayed there, winning
easily by 21 lengths from Redshank, with Ellaline
four lengths away. The time, 3min. sJsec., was very
ordinary. Manfred was saddled up again for the
Essendon Stakes, and mugs took 6 to 4 about his
chance, Pilliewinkie being 5 to 2, Pantheon 3 to
1, and the others (Lilypond, The Hawk, Frances
Tressady) any price. Once more Chaffey’s colt
exhibited a choice collection of circus tricks, and
refused to go after the field. Until the stable can
show that he has mended his rotten manners,* the
handsome brute’s nomination should be refused.
Pantheon led at the turn, and half-way up the
straight looked like winning easily, but Pillie-
winkie came with a fine run, and defeated the Eng-
lish horse by a neck, with Frances Tressady a good
third. Pilliewinkie, who was ridden by Young, ran
the 10 furlongs in 2min. 61sec.
On form, the Sydney colt Rampion stood out
from the seven other starters in the Sires’ Produce
Stakes, and at the finish of the betting he was 10 to
9 on, while Valaisian was 7 to 2 against, Cyden
B to 1 and Thracian 10 to 1. The favorite was
always at or near the front, and, stalling off a
late run by Oyden, won nicely by a neck from that
fi ]ly, with Cromwell (12 to 1) four lengths away
third. The beautiful Rossendale —Royal Pet colt
ran the seven furlongs in lmin. 25lsec. lie is
trained by Fred Williams for J. E. and C. H. Brien.
Valbee (7 to 1) completed a fair day for backers by
landing the Brunswick Stakes, 10 furlongs, from
Beau Fils (s’s) and Tookarby (25’s), with Highlander
close up. Valbee had run second to Belgamba in
the V.A.T.C. Bond Cup.
On Tuesday Pilliewinkie repeated Tartan’s 1906
achievement of winning the Australian Cup with
9st. 61b. on his back. The S.A. mare Lemina (Bst.
121 b.) and Valbee (6st. 101 b.) chased the Maoriland-
bred gelding home. It was a very fine performance on
Pilliewinkie’s part, for there is not much of him and
the Australian Cup is as trying a race as there is
in the world. Now owned by Samuel Hordern, who
bought him from the Maorilanders Nicholls and
King, Pilliewinkie was prepared for his Melbourne
engagements by Seobie, was ridden by Young and
was favorite almost from the publication of the
weights, his closing price being 2 to 1.
If Chryses (3 to 1) and Don Moon (5 to
2) had not bobbed up at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.)
on Saturday, many punters would have gone home
broke. As it was, hundreds of the fraternity had
a bitter day, two of the seven races going to 20-to-l
risks (His Highness and Feathernest) and three to
1,2-to-l shots (Translator, Defy and Mikaro). The
chances of several well-backed horses were spoilt by
interference. In the Canterbury Handicap, for in-
stance, Queen Alwyne (6 to 4) galloped on Shock’s
heels and fell back on Greendale (7 to 4), but for
which Mikaro would never have won. There were
similar incidents in other races, as indeed there are
at nearly every suburban meeting, and the stewards
ought to make a few wholesome examples. King,
who doesn’t get much riding nowadays, was seen
to advantage on Feathernest, who carried lOst. in
the Bankstown Handicap, and put in a fine run at
the finish. The son of Featherstitch—Fleet Street
still races in P. A. Connolly’s colors, and he is a
bit more than the five years with which the race-
book credits him. He certainly wasn’t a three-
year-old when he won the 1923 Kalgoorlie Cup and
ran third to Lilypond in the Perth Cup on the
following New Year’s Day.
* * * * *
“Blanc”: The Monday following the last
Rosehill (N.S.W.) races a pupil in my school brought
me her brother’s photo. “What’s this for, May?”
I asked. “T’ ’ang up in the room, sir,” was the
reply. I looked up at Nelson, Shakspeare, Cook,
Parkes and Monash, and inquired what the young-
gentleman had done. She showed pitying astonish-
ment at my ignorance as she loftily replied: “W’y,
’e won two races Satterdee—’is first day’s ridin’, too.”
* * * * *
“Bris” : Queensland fillies are still carrying
all before them in the two-year-old races. The
experiment of running a nursery at Albion Park was
tried, but the result was the same as usual —fillies
filled all three places. In the last seven two-year-old
races only one colt has been placed, and he merely
ran third. In 13 races put on this season, the only
colt to win was the Sydneysider, Royal Dignity.
* * * *
“Northerner”: Racing in the country can
still be conducted almost as cheaply as in the good
old days when the prize for the Slatheroo Cup was
a saddle and bridle. A Darling Downs (Q.) club
has issued the programme for its picnic meeting
on Easter Monday. The total added money for eight
races is £4l 125., and of that a good part will come
back in nomination and acceptance fees. Owners and
jockeys must also pay 10s. 6d. membership fee. The
principal event —the “Sires’ Produce Stakes” —is a
sweepstake with no added money; another sweep-
stake carries £1 added money. Trophies valued
at £l2 12s. are offered for the Cup, and most of
the minor events are worth £5, including £1 for
second horse. It is unlikely that Top Gallant
or Heroic will make the trip.
•****•
“Past Grammar”: Winston Churchill, in
his hunt for revenue, has again brought forward pro-
posals for a betting tax, and this time has also sug-
BUNKERED!
gested the adoption of the totalisator. The machine,
in its earlier forms, was no stranger to English
courses, where it was tried without any great success
before it was taken up in France during the Second
Empire. Essentially a popular betting medium, it
is doubtful if it would be a success in a country
where racegoing is not, even in these days, a popular
pastime. The vast bulk of the betting in Britain
is ' done by people who never see a racecourse.
Outside the annual • picnic at Episoin and the
“society” racecourse gambling in Britain
is mostly a matter for professional and would-be-
professional punters. To these, as in Australia, the
tote is no use at all.
* * * *
“Adelaide” : Echoes of the recent trouble
between the S.A. stipendiary stewards continue to
rumble in the Adelaide dailies. The suggestion is
revived that control of the sport should rest with
some sort of combined tribunal, instead of with the
S.A. Jockey Club alone. The Onkaparinga club has
taken the matter up, saying that it is “a public
scandal to leave things as they are” ; but as long as
the Adelaide Racing Club supports the S.A.J.C.
no change is likely. One sportsman calls the A.R.C.
the “wet nurse” of the senior body, and says that
the 0.R.C., “having exhibited the quills of a porcu-
pine, now reveals the htfart of a mouse”; to which
its chairman replies that “if any members of Mr.
Carr’s club”—Carr is chairman of S.A.J.C. —“choose
to force him into the ring, Onkaparinga will be
there.” An unusual feature about this newspaper
correspondence is that nearly all the letters are signed
with the full names of the deadly-earnest debaters.
* * X- *
“Hamer” : Sol Green, called as a witness
in the Harry Musgrove insolvency case, was described
as a “pastoralist.”
No doubt ’twas in the paddock he
Made teeming earth its increase yield;
The wealth that buys him luxury
Was always garnered from the field.
Just at this moment I forget
How many sheep he shears, or few.
But this I’ll confidently bet:
He’s skinned the lamb a time or two.
* * * *
Joe Hall, the negro lightweight, again
failed to please Sydney Stadium critics on Saturday
night. He wasn’t quite so much of a Shenandoah
Shuffler as on previous occasions, but his sly tricks
disgusted a crowd which his opponent, Tommy Fair-
hall, had also contrived to offend in his own way.
The coon took neck-holds and pegged away with the
right, and he repeatedly forced the miner’s head
back with the palm of his glove on nose and mouth.
Fairhall, for his part, showed a pitiful unwillingness
to fight. Either the lad was ill or he has lost his
enthusiasm for a game in which he once promised
to shine. After the uninteresting pair had jazzed
for 30 seconds or so in found seven, referee Wallis
ordered them to put more ginger into the infliction
or he would declare it “no fight.” After that they
made it a bit willing, but Fairhall nursed a bumped
left eye in his corner at the end of the round, and
discoursed dolefully with his trainer and chief second
as he was being attended to. In fact, he displayed
all. the symptoms of wanting to quit, and quit he
did at the end of the eleventh. Altogether, an un-
edifying contest. Hall scaled 9st. 101 b. and Fairhall
half a pound less.
* * * *•
Bert McCarthy (9st. 131 b.) has never
shown better form than in his contest with George
White (9st. 121 b.) at Melbourne Stadium. Palpably
above himself in condition, Mac. went in for an early
knockout, and after giving White a hiding, dropped
him for the count in the ninth round. The winning
punch was a perfectly-timed right on the point.
In the second fight, Jack Cameron (lOst. fiilb.)
stopped Dinny O’Donnell (lOst. 61b.) in 11
rounds. Dinny showed great gameness, but Cameron
had all the physical advantages, and pasted O’Donnell
unmercifully with his smart left.
Claire Couldwell surprised the Maoriland
contingent by defeating Piri Page in the 440yds.
championship at Coogee baths. The Sydney girl’s
advantage at the finish was 12 yards; and the time,
6min. 21 9-10 sec., was good, though neither girl
can be classed with Fanny Durack. The Auckland
damsel got even in the 220yds., which was contested
at Drummoyne; she beat Claire comfortably in
2min. S 4 4-6 sec.
* * * *
Having impressed the handicapper greatly
by his form in the Australian championships,
“Brusher” Jones, of Westralia, had the high compli-
ment of being put 1-J minute behind scratch in the
swim through Adelaide, 1 mile 200 yards upstream—
if there is • any stream in the Torrens these days
—from the weir to near the Zoo. But the 440yds.
champion was giving too much away. His time
(a local record) was 26min. 7sec., but Laurence,
from Murray Bridge, had 6min. start, and covered
the distance in 28min. 34sec. Quite a lot of girls
competed; in fact, one of them looked like winning 1
till pretty near the end of the long journey.
*' * * *
When the Assyrians came down like the wolf
on the fold, the silver and gold gleaming on their
cohorts were as nothing compared with the badges
and medallions hanging about the
army of bowlers who invaded
Sydney during the past fortnight.
There were 774 competitors for the
single-handed championship, which
J. E. Gustafsen (IV.A.) came over
to defend. Gustafsen failed to
repeat his fine form of last year,
and was beaten 22 to 10 by A.
Oastler (Vic.). The predominance
of the Victorians was eclipsed in
1925, but it was asserted again
■when Oastler beat A. Clarke (also
of Vic.) in the final, 31 to 19.
The new champion is a Camberwell
man, like Mr. Weller’s friend. A.
Parsons (M.L.) played masterly
bowls until, after having a lead
of 9 to 1, he suddenly lost sight
and direction and was beaten by
C. Bower (S.A.), who won the
third man’s trophy, S. Pickett
(Vic.) collecting the fourth. The
rink championship went to S.
Aus., through the agency of Mar-
chant, Wilson, Wyett and Miller
(c.), their opponents in the final
being the St, George (N.S.W.)
rink, led by Collins. There were
two other N.S.W. combinations in the semi-finals.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Prank Iredale, who has
retired from the secretaryship of the N.S.W. Cricket
Association, has been a sick man for some time, and
the association is recognising his eminent services
with an honorarium of £lOO and a pension. In his
prime Frank was one of the finest batsmen and out-
fields this country has seen. He had two outstand-
ing peculiarities: he threw the left leg across, instead
of the orthodox right, for the square cut, of which
he was a master; and he took his long-field catches
with his hands held baseball fashion, one over the
other, instead of side by side, as most players of his
day did. He had a fine record in Tests, playing 23
innings in England and Australia for 807 runs and
an average of 36.68, with a highest score of 140. His
inter-State record was equally good.
“Matt”: Four or five of the N. S. Welsh-
men in the Australian XVI will be too old for the
next touring team, but there should be no lack of
youngsters to take their places. A Jackson, a
Balmain lad having his first year in premiership
matches, has the highest aggregate this season- —529
runs, averaging 40.69. J. Foskett (Glebe), a pro-
moted Moore Park junior, has scored 517 runs,
averaging 73.85 ; and A. McGrath (North Sydney),
also in his first year, has scored 505 runs,
averaging 56.11. McGrath is a left-hander. Among
the bowlers, Otto Nothling (32 at 14.37) and H.
Hooker (38 at 22.52) are coming on. They bowl
right-hand medium-pace stuff, and Hooker, who plays
for Mosman, has a beautifully easy delivery. And
one must not forget Egan, of King’s School, who in
G.P.S. matches has scored 217 and 99 in successive
innings. Central Cumberland has its eye on Egan.
“Winkle”: St. Kilda, even without Pons-
ford, should gather its third consecutive cricket pre-
miership this year; but its pre-eminence is due
more to the lure of its beaches than to the athletic
ability of its natives. Ponsford learned to bat
in Fitzroy, and his captain, Bert Cohen, had many
years with Carlton before moving to St. Kilda.
Lampard, of the A.I.F. team, was a Richmond all-
rounder before the war, and helped Prahran to a
premiership after it. Fred Yeomans was 12th man
for Victoria many times through his fine batting
for Northcote, and Ray Levin began his career with
Melbourne. Hammy Love, of course, came from
N. S. Wales, and joined the seasiders after a season
at Carlton ; and Bert Ironmonger, once Queensland’s
star bowler, gave his best service to Melbourne
before taking his razors and scissors to the beach.
His fellow-destroyer, Don Blackie, had 11 seasons
with Prahran; and his understudy, Dunton. was a
country-week find. St. Kiida natives have done
little towards collecting premierships.
At Lancaster Park, Christchurch (M.L.),
on Monday evening Randolph Rose, the Dominion’s
great long-distance runner, settled his account with
the formidable American, Hahn. It was their third
meeting over the distance, a mile, Hahn having won
at Masterton in 4min. 37 4-ssec., and Rose at Wel-
lington in 4min. 26 2-ssec. There was no lingering
at Christchurch. The
mile was covered in
4min. 19 l-ssec., and
Rose won by a yard.
There is obviously very
little between the pair,
and there are Mel-
bourne judges who
maintain that young
George Hyde would be
a match for both. On
Saturday, Hyde, who
has never been ex-
tended, won the three
miles championship of
Vic. in the State record
time of 14min. 55sec.
He beat, the second
man by nearly a
quarter of a mile.
A. OASTLER
(Tic.), who has
succeeded Gustaf-
son, the West-
ralian, as howls
champion of the
continent.
“Trapper”: During a contest between two
rival teams of a Footscray (Vic.) junior association,
Jack, a wieketkeep, went in to bat. His side was
up against it, and lie was known to detest barracking,
so many of the onlookers commenced to roar. Jack
missed five balls from the googly bowler, and,
wildly swinging at the sixth, was stumped. As he
came in, furious, the scorer, sympathetic, but unwise,
remarked, “You didn’t hit one, Jack." “No,”
roared Jack, “you’re the first!” and he swung his
fist at the sympathiser’s jaw. It was a great fight,
though brief as a flapper's affection.
* * * *
Arthur Richardson, the only native-born
South Australian picked for the Australian XI, and
incidentally the only all-round cricketer to go to
England from Adelaide since the days of George
Giffen, has had a long series of farewells and presents.
The most practical was that of the insurance co.
which employs him; it has given him leave of
absence for the tour, on full pay. Giffen, Lyons
and Clem Hill were at the final send-off; also Vic.
Richardson, who has earned great respect by his
sporting acceptance of the selectors’ adverse verdict
and his unstinted praise of his more fortunate name-
sake. Clem Hill is to chronicle some of the deeds
of the men he helped to pick. S.A. Jockey Club has
given him six months’ leave from his duty as a sti-
pendiary steward. He will wait for the Onkaparinga
meeting on Easter Monday, and will leave immedi-
ately afterwards.
“Hotbam”: The British sportsman seems
to be shedding his most cherished traditions, one
by one. Witness the frantic appeal of London Daily
Mail for a captain who will not be “a charming
fellow likely to make the Australians feel at home,
but a master of cricket.” This is a sad departure
from the acccepted etiquette that it was a hundred
times better to lose as a demmed gentleman than to
win as a bally outsidah. It was a fine old tradition,
and even if it was a good deal more honored in
the breach than in the observance, one always had a
measure of satisfaction in recalling it —after the
other fellow had been licked, or vice versa. Whether
the rather sensitive Fender, on whom the Mail’s
choice has fallen, will feel complimented at the
implication, is another matter.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: Some idea oil the hold
which Soccer is getting in N.S.W. may be gained from
giving the State Association’s annual report a look
over. There arc 450 teams in N.S.W., not including
the many schools which play it as their official code
- —there are 140 of these in the metropolitan area
alone. Among the grown-ups, Sydney area supports
251 teams, while Newcastle and Maitland carry 122.
The N. D. Association, indeed, is the wealthiest in
the State; it recently bought a ground for close on
£4OOO. The report lays stress on the Rugby League’s
monopoly of Sydney Cricket Ground, and its policy
of arranging “big” fixtures there to clash with the
Soccer games against England last season. The
Soccer people maintain that, all codes should be given
an equal right to play their big games on this
ground, and the matter is likely to be dragged into
politics if the League refuses to budge.
BALLADE OF THE HUMBLE SPORT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not for me the compelling urge
That leads the lowliest to aspire
To reach the heights where the mighty splurge
The landscape o’er with their rich attire;
Lowly am I, nor would be higher;
My needs are many, my wishes few—
All I ask is a likely trier;
All I -want is a winner or two.
Some may sicken of humble serge,
Silken the raiment they require;
Sorry their tune as any dirge
That e’er was strummed on mournful lyre.
For me ambition lights no fire ;
Unheated still the peaks I view,
Contented ever to know the mire
All 1 want is a winner or two.
Come the tips from thaumaturge
Or yet the latest touting wire,
No pride have I that I need purge,
I’ll take “the office” from any liar.
Costly colt by noble sire
Or “hairiest goat” that e’er you knew—-
All I ask is a likely trier;
All I want is a winner or two.
Envoy.
Lord, ’tis settling day draws nigher,
My debts are many, my assets few;
Hear this plea from the suppliant choir—-
All I wa n't: is a winner or two.

THE INKY WAY.
“Lao-dah”: Ernest Wetherell, editor of
Barrier Daily Truth, has no peer in the
matter of striking doubles. He won £lOO
on a local racecourse the other day in the
practice of his art, and the next day his
wife presented him with twins.
The. Sierra brought to Sydney Leonard
Merrick, author of better books than many
men who have been better advertised; he
opened his mouth with the refreshing de-
claration that he is not here to write any-
thing about Australia. Merrick’s name used
to be Miller; he altered it by deed-poll.
“Wood’s Green”.: H. N. Southwell, held
in genial memory by so many Sydney con-
cert-goers. and for some years London cor-
respondent of the Evening News, is prepar-
ing his recollections for the printers; he is
dealing especially with Australian schools,
musicians and Christmas lie spent
in Spain, and during this year he will return
to Australia for, as he hopes, final settle-
ment. ,
“C.G.”: The Bulletin’s dear old friend
“Whiskers” Ward, the great journalist who
did so much for the Sydney Telegraph,
lately had occasion for rejoicing in the re-
turn of two wanderers. Dr. (the title is
medical in this case) H. Iv. Ward, who was
a Rhodes scholar and is now living at
Oxford, came back to Australia by the
Otranto, bringing with him a sister who has
attained success on the English stage in pro-
ductions ranging from Shakspeare to musical
comedy. The eldest member of the family
is director of the S.A. Department of Mines,
and is himself nearing the fifties.
Carl Akhurst, one of the new N. S. Wales
M’s.L.C.. who arrived too late for the Upper
House division on the reintroduction of the
Abolition Bill, was an olhce mate of Tom
Mutch in his early days at the Sydney
Worker office before Mutch transferred to
the literary side; when Mutch became Minis-
ter for Education Akhurst got a job as his
secretary. Jack Higgins, M.L.C., was also
a Worker clerk of the same period. Three
other M’s.L.C. had a connection with the
same paner —Grayndler as one of the trus-
tees, Bob Cruickshank as advertising man,
and McGrath on the printing side. Hector
Lamond, who had been editor-manager, got
into the Federal Parliament.
“Mel.” : A Melbourne topical verse-writer
has a set of standardised “poems” which,
with a few alterations, can Be made to fit
any occasion. When a cross-country jockey
was killed at Caulfield a few years ago the
bard invaded the Herald office, shed a few
tears over the jockey’s fate, and offered to
write a poem about it “while you wait.”
He was told to go ahead, and returned in
half an hour with a quite creditable piece
of jingle. It was on the point of being
accepted when Guy Innes recognised it.
“Why,” he said, “this is the same stuff that
you wrote about Tommy Corrigan years
ago!” The poet admitted it, but counter-
attacked with: “But doesn’t every word of
it fit the present case too?”
“lan C.”: For many years the Argus has
been the chief public trustee of Victorian
money raised by newspapers for charitable
purposes, but the Herald was the first to
hop in and open a bush-fires relief fund. It
collected £4OOO in four hours, including £5OO
from itself. Then the Argus took a hand
and on the first day announced £2500 (in-
cluding £250 from itself). Next morning the
Mackinnon journal filled four columns with
a list and triumphantly announced £11,680.
Its general manager also told a meeting of
citizens that the donations wore all spontane-
ous. The Fink sheet replied by forwarding
a cheque for £12,000 to the Gaud Mayor as
a first instalment, to show, no doubt, that
it held the coin and not mere promises.
And so the thing went on, and the public
got a thrill or two out of the rivalry for
a first-rate cause.
“Dal”: Fearful of one sheet “scooping”
the other, even our most conservative papers
are now sending their “social reporters" to
the boats to interview the lady passengers
on arrival. It is harassing enough to have
to arise at dawn to meet uncertain ships,
but many a sensitive woman reporter regards
that as bliss compared with what has to be
put up with from some of the assailed women
passengers. A much-photographed baroness
who recently arrived by a luxury liner shoved
a woman reporter so hard, when approached
courteously, that she had all she could do
to save herself a nasty fall on the deck. “Do
not bother me,” snapped the titled lady;
“I’m sick of you people asking me stupid
questions. In any case, I’ve sprained my
ankle and cannot talk!” One wonders what
sprain damaged the lady’s manners beyond
repair. But what of the newspaper Pro-
prietary that sends women on such fool jobs?
MARTYRDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were burning a martyr to-dav ;
It’s the best of sport under the sun.
With the faggots alight and his face turning white,
You roast him as brown as a bun
And you burn him as black as a coal.
With'the flames in his hair, you should hear how
he’ll swear
And the words all come out with a run.
He will t witter and. twitch in the splutter of pitch
And his soul may go off like a gun.
We were burning a martyr to-day.
It’s a sight that you really should see;
For you never can tell when he once starts to yell
What miracle’s going to be.
Though his mouth may be dumb, the bright angels
may come
And roost all around in a tree,
Or the flames may grow cold when they’ve got a
good hold
And sit down and play 7 at his knee.
We were burning a martyr to-day
In a way that is useful and kind.
All the faggots we flung with a click of the tongue
To merely disparage his mind;
As they burned up around him we all of us found
him
A person o’er-rated and blind.
His pretensions absurd we destroyed with a word
And his laurels we deftly untwined.
Yes, we burned for display an Australian to-day
From the core of his heart to the rind !

Hot weather prevails at Sydney Royal,
where the well-created atmosphere lends real-
ism to the dramatic action of “White Cargo.”
It is clearly impossible for any white man
to live and retain his decency on the West
Coast of Africa: the audience is convinced
of that by the competent acting of the prin-
cipals. , But the false premises recall the
remittance man’s letters to England about
the horrors of life near Bourke, mingling
with his lamentation a hint of his own hero-
ism in enduring it.

At Her Majesty's, Sydney, Margery Hick-
lin's search for a chance of being compro-
mised so that her pawky parent, Cecil Kella-
way, will consent to her marriage with his
secretary—a hare-brained comedian to whom
any provident father would have the strongest
objections continues to have completely
successful results, especially for the box-
office. The excellent orchestra in this show
deserves a passing tribute.
* * * *
Edward de Tisne got an opportunity last
week to step into Roy Rene’s shoes as
Secretary for State in the queer industrial
Commonwealth at Bauer’s Fruit-canning
Factory, and De Tisne’s place as the million-
aire suspected (with very good apparent
grounds) of being a lunatic was tilled by
Hal Percy. This practical example of “Give
and Take” in the cast produced nothing that
is not to the credit of the show now running
at Sydney Criterion. The same Hal Percy,
incidentally, is shortly going to take over the
part of young Bauer, Lou Vernon having
contracted to join the forthcoming “Rose
Marie” show.
:j: * * #
On Saturday next (March 6) “Kangaroo
Flat” comes to the Palace, Sydney; “The
Pelican” flew from this show-house last
Saturday, having found the climate, even in
summer, too cold for a longer stay. Mary
Hinton has gone to Melbourne to meet the
Dion Boucicault co., with which her future
destinies are cast; and Frank Harvey, hav-
ing invested in broad acres some of the better
fortune the stage now affords to mummers,
is spending a holiday on his farm on the
N.S.W. South Coast.
* * * *
The earnestness which the best of the
Yankee film-makers sometimes put into their
productions is shown in “The Iron Horse,”
the picture which was opened with a gala
night at the Prince Edward (Sydney) last
Friday; so also is the Yankee film-maker’s
weakness shown. The claim that it took four
years to prepare the goods—two years to col-
lect the material and two for the filming—
may be believed. The efficient picture-makers
went to the trouble to dig up the original
engine used on the United Pacific railway
and a number of other props, from museums
and elsewhere, and borrowed or bought them;
and settlements were built in the wilderness
to provide “location.” As a spectacle and
a historical picture the film is admirable,
but it has grafted on it, for “human interest,”
a love story that is quite crude; perhaps its
sentimentality is the sugar-coating to the pill
for the masses, who would consider the best
portions of the picture dry without it. But
the story is not bad enough to spoil what
is really a fine production.
Sydney Tivoli’s new arrival. Bob Albright,
is a tall and massive person, with a tremen-
dous voice, a good lot of stories, two attrac-
tive girl assistants, and a light way of look-
ing upon life which made a welcoming audi-
ence decide that he is an entertainer, as de-
scribed. Another new arrival, one Fransky,
provides freak dancing which consists largely
of expert tumbling, and shows that a man
who has the right knack of falling over him-
self can be very amusing. His imitation of
skating without skates is clever. The dances
Katrina and Joan stage this week add to
their laurels, and the Karreys are as amaz-
ing as ever. Ye Olde Minstrel Show is say-
ing its farewell like a young lover; it is
difficult to say whether the colorists are
really going, or will still be saying good-bye
for some time to come.
* * * *
An impression that the Fullers are saving
money to pay their income-tax was gathered
at this week’s Sydney show, the first part
being unusually thin, although, in a very good
juggling act, Earl Hunting does fine work on
a ladder. Chas. Sherman, an entertainer,
has some excellent matter, but knows very
little about delivering it. His impersonation
of Roy Rene deserved all the laughter it
gathered, however; and that of Claude Dam-
pier was fair. Jim Gerald’s part of the show
was in good form. Mona Thomas, one of
his band, has a voice, acting capacity and
style which would pay for polishing, but she
was provided with one dreadful song, sup-
posed to be an incitement to joy on account
of the shortness of life, which prolonged the
word “dying” over half a dozen bars or
thereabouts.
** * *
Hoyt’s De Luxe, in “The Fool,” depicts
the story of a curate with John Storm-ish
tendencies who, deciding to emulate Christ
in His appraisement of worldly things, sends
a millionaire audience home in a fit state to
suffer indigestion from its Christmas dinner
—which, one would think, was an un-Chris-
tian act. Hall Caine gave his Christian the
death which was the only happiness possible
for such a dyed-in-the-wool kicker against
the pricks. This Christian, being less dyed-
in-the-wool, manages a compromise which
brings him love and happiness. Not a bad
film; and “Rugged. Waters,” a salty story of
vigorous lifeboat-men, with no pretentions,
is better. “The Phantom of the Opera” has
begun operations which are likely to be
lengthy at the Crystal Palace. It is a weird
horror adapted from one of Poe’s phantasies.
Poe’s story is considerably garbled; but the
picture succeeds in its obvious intention,
which is to thrill.
** * *
Two plays were put on by Beresford
Fowler and his Little Art co. at the Queen’s
Hall (Melbourne) last week; but “Rutherford
and Son,” the first example was little morn
than the reading of a play. The man who
sacrifices his family on the altar of his
business is, at the best, an uninspiring tyrant,
and the author of the piece forgot to leaven
his draught with comedy, or. if the comedy
was there, the Little Artists failed to locate
it. The fine emotional acting of Ruth Cona-
bere, who led the revolt against the despot,
deserves mention; but the rest of the cast
tramped industriously to and fro and dis-
charged tlieTr elocutionary artillery, compli-
cated with a Yorkshire burr, without finding
the target, as far as this Showman’s im-
pressionable bosom is concerned.
* * * *
“Hindle Wakes,” on the other hand, pro-
vided as good mumming as is currently seen
on the commercial stage. The piece is also
set in the sombre North, although the habits
and customs of the indigenes suggest a
locality where the degrees of latitude are
represented by a nought. Amongst the Boo-
loodoopies of Borneo trial marriage is the
keystone of the social fabric. In Hindle,
Yorkshire, according to the playwright, it is
likewise the prevailing custom. The practice
there, however, is complicated by various
conventions. Thus when Fanny Hawthorn,
daughter of a lowly weaver, goes off to Llan-
dudno for a week-end with Alan Jeffcote. a
son of her papa's employer, an awkward situ-

ation has arisen. Her parents see in the
incident not a moral disaster, but the inter-
vention of a thoughtful Providence bent on
providing sustenance for their old-age and
a wealthy husband for their daughter;
and the youth’s attitude is complicated
by the fact that he is engaged to
the daughter of Hindle’s titled Mayor.
The Mayor is all for proceeding with
his daughter’s wedding until Alan’s father
declares he will disinherit him unless he mar-
ries the wronged lass. This alters things
considerably, and in the upshot the entire
cast, except those principally concerned, con-
cent rate on making the son marry Fanny.
Having obtained his consent, they proceed
to plan the nuptials; and then the wronged
girl, who up to this has not been heard from,
throws a bomb into the ring by declaring
that she has no intention of marrying Alan.
She went for the week-end to Llandudno for
precisely the same reason as he did, and as
she found him barely to her liking she pro-
poses to fare forth into the world to look
for a man she can love sufficiently to marry.
This up-to-the-minute tract on woman’s
rights hangs well together, and it was inter-
preted by a staff of high ability. The shrewd
calm of Dulcie Bland as the enigmatic Fanny
threw the right air of expectation over the

beginning of the evening, and when her turn
came to heave her T.N.T. into the family
circle she did it without, melodrama and
with precision. Sylvia Archer was a some-
what stagey Beatrice, but W. T. Devine made
an amusing old reprobate as her father. Oscar
Behrend, as Fanny’s father, was consistently
bucolic; Betty Rae, bis wife, competently
stripped the peasant soul bare, and Harold
Harwood, the millowner, saw his social ambi-
tions crumbling with consistent discom-
posure. Heather Macgregor, a bewilderingly
chic housemaid, was easily the most distin-
guished inhabitant of Hindle.

“The Sport of Kings,” which starts at Mel-
bourne Athenamm on Saturday, is stated not
to be a Nat Gould shocker in which the
jockey-hero gets nobbled and the owner’s
daughter rides the favorite to victory amid
thunders of applause from four supers, and
a boy. It is purely a farce comedy, and was
written by lan Hay, the man who kept the
Empire laughing during the blackest days of
the world-war.

The Oklahoman Bob Albright and his
female entourage drifted from the scene at
Melbourne Tivoli on Saturday, and a Chinese,
alleged to be the one comedian in a nation
of 400 million sober-sided people, stepped
into their place. If vaudeville is the highest
expression of organic evolution, then the
family Psittacidae has reached a higher plane
than Homo sapiens, judging by the fact that
Harmston’s cockatoos put the feats of the
juggling Swifts and the aerial Benos, good
as they are, completely in the shade. Lily
Morris continues to appeal with Cockney
humor, and the Seven Hollanders laugh and
leap with only moderate response from the
other side of the foots.

The very tangible Elsa Stralia is still com-
peting with the celluloid wraiths of Holly-
wood for the attention of patrons at Mel-
bourne Majestic. Her belligerent soprano is
being heard in that patriotic chanty, “Land
of Hope and Glory,” and her soberer notes,
with the hint behind them always of more
splendid resources, in classic items. “The
Verdict” is the chief picture. It is a mystery
drama in which the hero and heroine get
mixed up in a murder, with the happiest
results. Madge Bellamy, in the supporting
film, is leaving no doubt as to which is “The
Reckless Sex.”

The Old Nigger Minstrels have firmly
established themselves in the hearts of Mel-

Drink intrudes into a garden of roses with-
out causing any worse disaster than a
delirium of laughter.

Seeing “Night Life in New York” on the
screen at Hoyt’s (Melbourne) is safer than
getting oneself mixed up in the actual sport
or business, and quite thrilling enough.
“When the Door Opened,” at the same
house, is a high-life story with Jacqueline
Logan as the door-opener. Suburbanites
condemned in various centres to watch their
seedlings die under the present water-
restrictions won’t be comforted by the sight
of millions of gallons, of moisture running
to waste over the Barron Falls (Q.) in the
fine “scenic” shot by the Federal Government.

Adelaide theatres are about to wake up
from their summer siesta, Allan Wilkie, at
the Prince of Wales, being the first to ‘start,
with “Aladdin” promised by Myers at tin
Theatre Royal immediately. Meanwhile
George Gee is funny at the Garden, where
Yvonne Banvard displays her charms, and
six of the “Snap” girls have been dropped
into the programme. Clem Dawe is the back-
bone of a very similar co. at the Majestic.
In pictures “The White Monkey,” at the
York, has the surprising result of putting
Galsworthy among the writers for the multi-
tude. At Wondergraph is “Decameron
Nights,” far less wicked than some of the
publicity notices try to hint. West's have
a fairly good American picture and a jolly
good Australian band, the Silver Instrumen-
talists, under Albert Baile.
“Blum” : The American fillum industry is
the brightest jewel in civilisation's crown,
but I never enter a show without acquiring
doubts on the subject. I have read about
the thoroughness and erudition that go into
fillum-making and the hundreds of thousands
of dahlers that are spent to ensure that all
is according to Docker, but in half an hour
the other night I spotted three errors that
wouldn’t have got past an intelligent office-
boy. The first, which was in a fillum that
boasted an “editor” as well as a named title-
writer, was a persistent misplacing of the
apostrophe in the explanatory legends. The
second was a close-up picture of a gramo
phone, depicting the instrument playing away
merrily with the needle on the no-man’s-land
patch in the centre of the record. And the
third was a young man who played on the
pianoforte the “Blue Danube” waltzes of
Strauss, and did it so that his hands dashed
from one end _of the keyboard to the other,
his fingers twinkling too rapidly for the eye
to follow them. That, of course, is the way
all actors and actrines play on the stage, but
in the fillums surely with all those dahlers
they can buy a little originality—not to men-
tion commonsense.
“Fitz”: Sydney Repertory Society has
started on its sixth lap resolved to go one
better than last year. At present its whips
are out rounding up members for the open-
ing bill, which will be a five-night affair at
the Con.. Granville Barker’s “The Madras
House” is the sprat to catch the season’s
mackerels, and the first night is listed for
March 20. Others on the cards for 1920
production are Shaw’s “Androcles and the
Lion,” Pirandello's “Six Characters in Search
of an Author,” and Galsworthy’s “The
Show.” Gregan McMahon might also squeeze
in an additional Shavian effort and plays by
Anatole France and G. K. Munro if time
permits. “The Madras House” holds up the
mirror to the feminine world and a number
of varied types are interwoven. This society’s
play-reading circle has also started again
on the first Wednesday of each month.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The first public meet-
ing of the National Opera Trust has been
held. The Duchess of Atholl, who in appear-
ance and manner is strikingly like Vida
Goldstein, made a very practical appeal.
Landon Ronald mentioned letters received from
Albert Coates, Tetrazzini, Sir Henry Wood
and Melba, but none of them offered either
money or service. Labor-leader Clynes, who
has a musically-gifted son, addressed him-
self to the subject in hand with great clarity
and effect. But —the hall was only a quarter-
full, and no one promised any form of defi-
nite assistance, although the audience in-
cluded many notable people. As musical
affairs generally are at a very low ebb, one
may safely say that it will be some time be-
fore the National Opera Trust will do any-
thing very practical.

The peerless fit of “JASON” Underwear is a joy to the men
and women who want to feel neat and trim all through.
The “JASON” fit is as perfect as that of any of your exterior
garments,and infinitely more comfortable. The “JASON”
finish is equal to the “JASON” fit. Silky, and without the
least suggestion of hairiness, it is sympathetic to the most sensitive
skin— and NEVER SHRINKS IN WASH AND WEAR.
ALL-WOOL UNSHRINKABLE'
UNDERWEAR
" Olympic” Brand

the same guar-
antees of value
and satisfaction
as “Jason.”
Poverty
Point
“S.G.”: Bulletin contributors a while
ago wrote about a Quirindi (N.S.W.) con-
cert at which only Australian compositions
were to be rendered. The affair was duly
held, and the programme is before me as 1
write. Leaving out Novelty Turns, Ventri-
loquial Acts and Songs (selected), the sub-
joined numbers were given :
PART I.
Overture, “Billjim Aussie.”
Song, “King of the Air.”
Song, “Red Rosebud.”
Song, “Oroajingalong.”
Song, “Where Did You Get ’Er?”
Song, “My Wishes for You.”
Chorus, “Wattleblossom Time in Australia."
PART 11.
Overture (.jazz band), “Kosciusko.”
Chorus, “The Southern Cross.”
Song, “For God and St. George.”
Song, “Billjim Aussie.”
Chorus, “Advance, Australia Fair.”
It is rather saddening. Haven’t we done—
or can’t we do—better?
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Madge Titheradge,
having set her foot on the first rung of the
serious ladder of her art, takes another step
up with the role of Beatrice, which she is
to play to the Benedick of Henry Ainley.
Miss Titheradge’s Nora in “A Doll’s House”
has immensely raised her professional
stature. Ainley retains his facial beauty,
though in figure he is perhaps now a trifle too
rotund for an ideal Benedick; but the fine
quality of his acting should easily compen-
sate for that handicap. His aim is to bring
the performance within two hours and three-
quarters by speeding up the action.
“Caul Boy”: Despite managerial propa-
gandists who .bombard the newspapers with
artless stories about theatrical persons, the
chief hobby of Important People connected
with the Melbourne stage is not keeping
white mice or devoting their leisure hours to
making the last days of maiden aunts happy.
It is attending shows at other houses. At a
recent first night, so well staged was the
entrance of Dorothy Brunton to the o.p. box
(tumultuous cheers), and the arrival of Elsie
Prince at the prompt box (more cheers), that
the applause which greeted the real star of
the evening made an anti-climax. The habit
of getting free passages into rival theatres
extends to all hands. The only exception
that I know is Maurice Nodin, generalissimo
of Melbourne Tivoli. He hasn’t looked at
any show but his own for the last five years.
“Avon” : Sydney can now tie a brick to
its neck and jump off Circular Quay. It
has been weighed in the balance by the
popular manager of the Gaiety Picture
Theatre at Napier (M.L.), pop. 15,235, and
found to be a second Sodom and Goinorrali.
The Harbor City, according to a newspaper
interview given by this stern critic, is “just
one big cesspool of immorality,” the hotels
cater almost exclusively for persons who
would be at once told bv the police to leave
Maoriland did they dare to enter that fair
country, the girls arc “washed-out, painted,
powdered and shallow,” and their collective
morals need seeing to; the picture-theatres
are dirty and ill-ventilated —-“like huge gar-
bage-bins”—and the posters exhibited would
make a rhinoceros blush. As this comes from
the representative of a trade that feeds the
public just as much salacity as overworked
censors will permit, Sydney must see that it
is about time it learned again how to blush.
“Bouragi”: Papuan natives are now for-
bidden to attend picture-shows at the same
time as Europeans. Port Moresby runs a
“white" show on Saturdays and a “brown"
one on Wednesdays. The ordinance is not
due to any propensity on the part of the
now converted heathen to crack cocoanuts,
instead of peanuts, with his teeth, or to in-
dulge too deeply in his taste for cocoanut-oil
massage. It is considered that the more
rotten variety of Hollywood films should not
be shown before Brown Brother while white
folk are in juxtaposition with him, especially
white girls.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : Great joy in
London over the transfer of Sacha Guitry's
musical play “Mozart” from his beautiful
little theatre in the Champs Elysees to the
neighborhood of the Strand. Before that
happens 10 performances will be given at
the Opera Comiqne so as to place it in
the repertory of that fame-making house.
“Mozart” is almost entirely devoid of his-
torical accuracy, but it offers such oppor-
tunities to Guitry’s charming wife Yvonne
Printemps, to Guitry himself and to Reynal-
do Hahn, that people willingly allow that
the theatre is not for lessons in history.
“Light Horse” : What is the reason for the
convention which demands that the movie
producer must garb himself for his job in
riding-kit—or, at least, his idea of it? The
Hollywood geniuses photographed in idiotic
photo.-play magazines are all got up that
way, and the quaint fashion has reached this
country, as I saw for myself when on a
visit to a “shoot” of a picture now being
made. It was all done indoors, but the pro-
ducer, true to professional traditions, was
horsily breeched, although he wore army
field-boots instead of the customary gaiters.
Further, the two experts who did the actual
“shooting” turned their little handles in a
garb that would not have disgraced an Irish
gentleman-horsedealer. There was neither
sight nor scent of a prad about the premises,
and I should judge that none of the trio
wrnuld have known what to do with it if there
had been.
“Tabragalba”: “Abracadabra’s” jeer at
my alleged ignorance of the film situation
(B. 25/2/'26) lost its point wdien he added:
“I don’t know of one showman who has
been forced to screen any picture on a per-
centage basis.” Why butt into the argument
to tell us what he doesn’t know? I do know.
I quoted a specific case which was backed
up by documentary proof. The showman
certainly has Hobson’s choice among a num-
ber of Yankee film exchanges, but once he
has signed a contract to ensure a regular
programme he is at the “cahmp’ny’s” mercy.
“Abrac.” boasts of the “hundreds of
tralians” employed by Yankee film-houses.
What about the thousands of good Austra-
lians who have been kept out of employment
because of the U.S. monopoly? What about
the millions of good Australian money which
has gone to Yankeeland untaxed?
OUR AMATEUR DRAMATIC CO.
“You must have had a big part in the per-
formance last night to make you so
hoarse, Mr. Brown.”
“Yes, I did. I was the prompter.”
“H.H.N.": Goolwa (S.A.) has a pianist
who pounded out 350 chunes one night at
a local picture-show. On the next evening
he obliged with 160 —310 in about four
hours. He was a substitute for the regular
accompanist and played by ear.
From an Australian at Barcelona (Spain) :
Thirty years ago or thereabouts, during a perform-
ance of “William Tell” at the Barcelona Opera,
there was a terrible bomb outrage which resulted
in death or injury to many. Since that unhappy
occurrence the opera has been taboo in the Catalan
capital and no one has ventured to propose its pro-
duetion until this season, when it was revived by
request of John Sullivan, an Irish tenor who is a
kinsman of Sir Arthur —a nephew, it is said. This
artist has a fine voice under excellent control and
is an admirable actor. He has completely infatuated
the Spanish public in such operas as “Otello,”
“Aida” and “William Tell,” and the enthusiasm at
the “Tell” performances shows that even a long
sustained tradition can be laid low by a supremely
gifted artist.
“Frinigga” : Several late-Victorian roman-
tic plays which Australia associates mostly
with the name of Julius Knight are operas
now. “Beaucaire” was one of the first, and
J. H. McCarthy’s “If I Were King” has just
been dealt with. Even Ruritania and Zenda
are to be taken possession of by Rudolph
Rassendyll with assistance from an orches-
tra ; title, “Princess Flavia.”
“Cißsar’s Ghost” : There has been a sudden
re-arrangement in the affairs of a travelling
company. The proprietor set out to star an
actor who had decided to remain in Aus-
tralia after the expiration of his contract
SIMPLY A CHING FOR IT.
HIGHBROW : “Now, sir, I presume you have never
heard me in my ‘Descent to Hell’?"
LOWBROW: “No: but I’d love to.”
with a more ambitious management, but
sacked him, and is trying to turn failure
into success with a native-born load. On
the strength of the imported gent.’s account
of himself and carefully-selected notices of
his work, the entrepreneur planned two- and
three-night shows in country towns —-the
quality of the genius was going to make the
extra nights bigger affairs than the openings.
The first nights were good, but the falling-
off in the subsequent houses convinced the
manager of the mistake he had made. He
spoke savagely to the actor-r, who replied
that the fault lay with a public which was
blind to the qualities of a True Artist. “It’s
no use your talking about being an artist,”
the manager replied sadly—“you can’t
draw!”
“Goldilocks” : The experiences of the Bri-
tish National Opera Co. (so called because
its stars are mostly Australian) are not cal-
culated to encourage the people who are
making the Sydney effort to secure repertory
opera. In four years the co. lost £42,594,
and an appeal for £lO,OOO to keep it going
brought in a whole £931. The concern is
struggling on, but any town that wants to
hear its productions must nowadays put up
a guarantee.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : In “Kid Boots,”
a New York success which ,T. A. E. Malone
brought across the Atlantic, and which is
to he seen at the Winter Garden after a run
through the provinces, a part has been
assigned to Diana Wilson. The fairy-like,
feather-footed June was to have played the
leading role, but inopportune appendicitis
has called her elsewhere.
“Avon” : Sydney is in the throes of “Moon-
light and Boses.” Probably the most banal
and—after the hundredth time—utterly vicious
air that was ever invented, it is yet of fairly
respectable parentage. Organist Lemare,
who gave recitals here 20 years back, wrote
the notes down ages ago, and in the
sober guise of an “Andantino in D Flat” the
melody has enchanted millions of Christians
on the Sabbath morn. Then, quite recently,
Neil Morel:, who has never made a really big
hit since he composed “Hiawatha,” a tricky
little intermezzo of the last generation, took
the popular church piece in hand, stuck a
little jazzy wriggle in the middle, got some
sentimentalist of his acquaintance to per-
form the feat of rhyming “you,” “true” and
“new” as a refrain to stanzas that neither
rhyme nor scan—and behold ! an overwhelm-
ing popular success. On every suburban and
urban gramophone and piano, from the saxo-
phones of every jazz orchestra, from the
strings of every ukulele, at all hours of the
day and night, the horror is belched forth.
Even the young man across the way who
practises the banjo-mandolin very early in
the morning has deserted “It Ain’t Gonna
Bain No Mo’ ” for the latest disease.
“Curtain-raiser”: One curious effect of the
bush-fires in Victoria may he noted. Appa-
rently Melbourne was getting all the real
drama of the Backblocks it could accommo-
date through the reports coming in daily
from Warragul and Powelltown. Anyhow,
it ceased to attend in large numbers at the
version supplied at the Athenaeum in “Kan-
garoo Flat.”
Caesar s Ghost”: The audience is often
to blame for the orchestra drinking. Ella
shields has had three or four seasons in
bydney, and she has sung “Burlington
Bertie every night. It is not Ella’s fault.
" Il ® ® C'led to break her audiences of the
habit, but the publicity man has done his
work too well; and each night, as the orches-
tra eventually starts to play the air, the
house ripples down its anticipatory thanks
m applause. A critic who knows the pubs
can drop out and find immediate relief, but
the orchestra is denied this consolation. It
lias to let its thirst grow by wliat it doesn’t
feed on.
“Hamfat : George Parker, who has be-
come a .sort of habit with .T. C. Williamson,
Ltd., is back in Australia. His last visit
was made to produce the Guy Bates Post
plays, but the Firm passed him round to
every one of its shows, except the musical
comedies, and his return to
America was months overdue by
the time he was allowed to get
away. Now, after a mere few
months’ absence, he has recrossed
the Pacific, and his stout figure
is likely to be seen in every
theatre lobby of Sydney and Mel-
bourne once more.
* * *
“Noise Off”: As joint-author,
with elder brother .Tosef. of “The
Life of the Insect," Karel Oapek.
the .Czecho-Slovakian dramatist
whose “R.TT.R.” caused a stir
among Sydney repertorians last
year, is responsible for a sudden
increase in the ranks of the ento-
mologists in Sydney. Duncan
Macdougall hopes to produce late
in _ March the Capek brothers’
weird allegory, in which different
creeping pests take the stage in
parodies of life as lived by man. On the
mechanical side some innovations in play-
production are promised, and for the sen-
sation-monger there is to be a battle royal
between armies of ants.'
From Eva Moore (London), the widow of
Henry V. Esmond:—
I liked The Bulletin's review of “Jacob Ussher. ’
You may be interested to know that the book had
been adapted from the play “Birds of a Feather”
by my late husband, with my permission; but an
acknowledgment was omitted when the book was sent
out. The play was produced at the Globe Theatre
in 1920 by Marie Uohr, and Mr. Esmond created
the part of Jacob Ussher. It is now being acted
in New York.
"C. Ockney”: “Is variety dead?” asked
one of England’s best-known vaudeville com-
edians in an address to the fraternity in
London. Fred Kitchen, the headliner in
question, a son of a famed pahtomimist,
wanted to see the glories of the old-time
British institution revived without the help
of Yankee impresarios. “Train our own
people in the business,” said Kitchen stoutly.
I like his closing remarks: “All our young
people in revue are either going to Dixie or
coming back, and in the next revue they’ll
still be going to Dixie or coming back!”
“F.K.”: Mention of Johnny Sheridan (B.
11/2/’26) reminds me of his countryman and
friend Grattan Riggs. Grattan sleeps in
the quiet little graveyard overlooking Mac-
quarie Harbor, Strahan (Tas.). The marble
tombstone bears the following inscription:—
“Don’t forget the poor Shaughraun! ”
In memory of Grattan Riggs. Born Buffalo,
N.Y., U.S.A., 1835. Died June 15, 1899.
Erected by his Friends.
A bronze tablet informs the traveller that
Grattan was “one of the original four who
founded the benevolent order of Elks of the
U.5.A.,” and that “he portrayed the humble
virtues of everyday life and saw nothing
truer than happiness nor sweeter than truth.”
“Scots Grey”: In her flapper days Melba
lived for a time on her father’s selection in
the Mackay (Q.) district. Charlie Arm-
strong was then managing the Victoria sugar-
mill. He was not half a bad boss, but lie
knew as much about sugar-squeezing as
Pharaoh knew about radio. About a year
later he married Nellie, being then manager
of the newly-built Marion milk In the mill-
house (which still stands) they lived for the
balance of their stay in Mackay, which the
lady has never visited since. Nellie Arm-
strong and a doctor’s wife often sang at local
concerts. The Mackay eritics allowed that
her voice wasn’t bad, but preferred that of
the doctor's missus.
“C. Ockney”: Sean (pronounced “Shawn”)
O’Casey (B. 21/l/’26) had a variegated
career before he turned dramatist. Accord-
ing to a curtain-speech by actor-manager
Dennis Eadie, who produced “Juno and the
Paycock” (what a perfectly delicious title !)
at the London Royalty, the new author has
been in turn errand-boy, casual laborer,
navvy and bricklayer. Many a playwright
these days would be glad to earn as much
as a bricklayer. .

“Some of the mystery relating to the Govern-
ment’s sudden decision to permit the Countess of
Cathcart to enter the United States has been cleared
away. The Countess has signed a theatrical con-
tract.” — Cable.
Like some bright meteor shot from space,
Rapt earth’s attention to engage,
She blazes now upon the stage.
A wide-flung public knows the face
That smiles from off the printed page
Of magazines, and gives a glad
Appeal in beauty-puff and ad.
Whence has this queen derived the fame
That makes the peoples near and far
Acclaim her as a new-found star,
Spreading more knowledge of her name
Than Irving’s ? Did she “Lochinvar”
Recite with magic-laden breath,
Or seize the dagger in “Macbeth”?
Perish the thought!. The contract goes
As tribute to more splendid art.
No player of a mummer’s part,
Whate’er her skill, such honor knows
That makes the world with joy to start.
The Queen of Stageland now is she
Who scores by acting as co-re.

It does what no other
safety razor can do- —
THE “Valet” Auto Strop is the only safety razor in the world that
strops its blade without removal from the frame. It gives the
world’s fastest, smoothest and most comfortable shave because the
blade is sharpened automatically in ten seconds before every shave.
Thus each blade retains its edge for weeks and weeks and so saves
you money, because you strop it before every shave. Nothing to
unscrew. Nothing to take to pieces.
The “Valet” razor is made in several qualities. The newest and
lowest-priced model, illustrated below, costs only 3/6.
THIS IS THE NEW THREE AND SIXPENNY SET.
Contains the essentials for a perfect Valet shave——
the Razor, one Blade and Strop in a neat case. If
your dealer does not stock it, the Agents will send
it post free on receipt of a postal note for 3/6.

Patent Rail Tractor operating on Rash Tramway with severe curves and grades up
to 1 in 6 in presence oj Sawmillers’ Association and Secretary (without hat).
TJie Nattrass Patented eight or twelve wheel drive
Rail Tractor, now being introduced into Victoria, is
the outcome of upwards of five years’ extensive experi-
menting and experience. This system utilises the dead
weight being carried on the rear bogey for tractive
force. Economy in transport is one of its chief features.
One case of petrol per day provides power equal to
twelve horses. The saving is enormous: tramways need
not be ballasted, bridges can be lighter and need no
decking, expensive cuttings need not be made to ease
the grades, as this tractor can haul a load up any
grade that same can be braked down with safety.
A great number of these are in use in New
Zealand, and are operating on all kinds of tramways
with grades up to one in five with and against the load.
The following opinions are worthy of note:—
Mr. Baigent, Akatarawa Sawmilling Co.: “This Tractor has
performed some remarkable feats, including the carrying of our
Log Hauler, weighing eight tons, up a one-in-five grade in a
few minutes, what would have taken more than a day by any
other means.”
Mangawhero Sawmilling Co., Raetahi: “After spending
£700(1 on tramway, and purchasing locomotive unable to shift
any timber because of grade being one in nine, one million and
a half feet of timber accuuulated, and your Rail Tractor saved
the situation. One machine, by operating day and night, cleared
the yard in four months, besides removing the output, of our
mill of approximately 7000 feet per day.” Additional mills
have been constructed and they now own four Rail Tractors.”
Manakau Sawmilling Co., which claims to operate on the
most difficult country in the colonies, after experience in loss
of many horses, installed one machine nine months ago, and
have now purchased their second machine. Besides increased
output of timber due to the more rapid and reliable means of
transport, they have effected a saving of £25 per week.
A sample Rail Tractor may be seen at our Warehouse.
Sawmillers, Quarry Owners, Cement, Sugar and Coal Com-
panies are invited to apply for all particulars, and those desirous
of arranging for demonstrations are invited to communicate on
the subject.

Electrification of Mines
IN his search for the treasures of the earth,
man digs deep. In many mines, man, the
human mole, burrows a mile or more below
the surface of the ground.
It is electricity which enables him to work
these tremendously deep mines safely and
profitably. It provides him with pumps,
tools and power; it gives him, in the deepest
shafts and levels, light as clear as that of day.
Electric drills easily “bite” into the hardest
rock; electric “mules” transport it to the
shaft; the electric hoist lifts it to the surface.
On every side, electricity and electric equip-
ment work for him and safeguard him from
danger.
In this electrification of mines the engineers
and local representatives of the International
General Electric Company throughout the
world are rendering unremitting service.
This service is at your command.

THE “KEMP”
SADDLE
£l4/7/6 8 £lO/7/6.
THE "KEMP” is a great favorite with riders who
have a bit of rough work occasionally. The shape
and position of the pads give wonderful security to
the rider. We are making it in two qualities—the
best (sold at £l4/7/6) is a high-grade saddle
throughout and is fitted with, special Kemp pattern
girth, bevelled leathers and solid nickel stirrups.
The second quality, at £lO/7/6, is exactly the same
style and is fitted with folded girth, leathers and
n.p. stirrups. For cash with order we pay freight
to any N.S.W. railway station.

T. 0.: It would eat up too much precious
space; that style of thing doesn’t suit these cramped
pages.... Lance P.: You haven’t made it swallow -
able. .. .E.L.S.: Saw the end coming from afar....
8.M.N.0.: You don’t get to real grips with your
subject... .Awstruth: Heaven only knows why you
should regard the word “bloke” as “dinkum Aus-
tralian slang.” It’s pure Cockney ... . John M.:
“Mammoth Spoof” consumes too much space for the
interest it pays.... J.R.C.: The humor moves too
laboriously... .Stell: The artist had nothing to do with
that.... John M.: You’ve got nothing fresh to say
on the subject... .W.E.8.: First-rate start; not a
bad ending; but the middle sags... .8.L.P.: It is
not well done.... Richard M. Too technical....
7PN: Sorry to return “Crim •> Act.” Much of it
is very true and wants saying: some of it is liable
to be badly misunderstood and misrepresented—
there are too many people whose job it is to mis-
understand and misrepresent... .C.D.T.: Cleverly
done ; but the “plot” is frayed with long and hard
use... .M.H.S.: It fell at the last hurdle... .11.G.8.:
It falls away at the end... .1.H.M.: Not up by a
long veay... .Griff: Hasn’t much of a point....
E.J.A.: He appears to be rather a dreary person....
E.D. (Perth) : “Fool’s Way” is impossible in that
form. .. .Tere: The lines contain nice phrases but are
too jumpy....Joph: Yes, there have been two or
three worse this week.... P.T.0.: The verse says
the old things and does not say them very well.
Try to get something fresh... .N.H.T.: We have
already had that story twice in different forms. Earlier
than that it was published elsewhere... .A.S.E.:
Does n'rt make much of a yarn.... Robin A.: No use
for thin, cheap stuff of that sort....S.E. (Norman-
hurst) : Shocking... .N.R. (Kirribilli) : The remarks
of the vegetables are only thin commonplaces and the
metre hops in an unhappy way. ... J.W.H.: The
manner of it doesn’t carry the gentle absurdities. That
air-tube, for instance, would have been a merry little
thing of at least 50,000,000 tons weight and would
require very light handling... .C.M. (Byron Bay);
Too much preface. The essence of the yarn would
make a good paragraph E.M.S.: The mild trouble
between Basil and Marie doesn’t seem worth all that
worry... .Peggy It.: All far below standard... .S. A.
(Mildura) ; The verse is young and thin... .T.T.R.:
Can’t find much to interest there. .. .Bioko: Moves
with ponderous staggers to say very little.... A.W.D.:
Doesn’t rouse us to any enthusiasms.... H.G.8.: The
verse is too poor to carry the idea. .. .G.R.L.C.; It
goes rather feebly... .Norson: Hardly worth all that
pleading... .H.M.H.: The verse is a bit lumpy and
gets to very littl e.... Ripponiea: The mysterious
horror of the thing grips like a postage stamp:—
He felt weak, as though ’round his spine
Did a slimy serpent twist and twine;
He seized and drained a bottle o’ quinine.
He wander’d round the room, a-reeling;
While e’en the flies were dropping from the ceiling
The shadow of a spent echo of a mutter
Whose vibrations were at their last feeble flutter,
Accompanied by a rank odor of must,
Blew across the room on a gust.
He collapsed into a chair and sat
And said “I know what it is! It’s That!”
“Good Heavens, not That?” did his wife enquire,
“Then we must make haste and light the fire!”
....Stella S.: We don’t publish sketches that have
been bought by other papers... .K.W.C.: Too long
for its interest. .. .A.E.Y.: The opal tale holds the
interest to a point, and then tails off to nothing. .. .
I. (Wellington) : The idea is old and the telling is
rather tedious.... Dorothy Iv.: Not for u 5.... Scots
Grey: You don’t make enough of it....F.M.
(Gympie): Novelettes of that sort about girls with
“eyes of heavenly blue” are no use to u5....J.C.
(Double Bay): Clever, but not very convincing,
though you tell it prettily.... Vita D.: Mrs. Mac
doesn’t stir us... .A.M.8.8.: The verse and the
kangaroo yarn fai1....M.8. (Gisborne): The sorrow
doesn’t get through... .M.G. (Toowong) : Can’t say
w hat the ecstasy may be; but the verse doesn’t startle
us... .Elizabeth M.: Your “Bush-fires” add a touch of
horror to the reality:—
Great bush-fires are burning and mighty the flames,
And the Townies are blamed for lighting the same,
Quite often it happens the same it is true,
But the man on the land he starts not a few.
He sets fire to a log a rabbit to scout,
Some woods we know will never go out,
But smoulder for days and weeks at a time.
Then all of a sudden on a hot windy day,
Off, off, away, not a moment, to stay,
But spreads its great arms and legs every way.
And then! where and when
Will be the climax or the end?
“Well, that just depends.”
.... H.R.M.: The verse is too rocky.... Harold B.:
Doesn’t say what it wants t 0... .0.M.0.: It hasn’t
much resemblance to verse.. . .H.R.M: That horseplay
business, with father getting the bumps, has been
worked to death... .Denis M: The verse is too poor
to carry anything R.W. (Watson’s Bay): Not
quite enough in it; and one patch is ungrammatical.
. ...S.H.: Some of it gets near; the trouble is you
rhyme too easily without troubling to think whether
you have anything fresh to say Vera S.: It has
feeling, but is not well enough carpentered Stanley
T.: No use putting the sermon in that heavy and
unattractive setting. .. .E.M.H.: The verse is thin and
imitative. But you may do better.... F.F.F.:
Thanks; it’s always pleasant to read things like
that. But when this paper gets into every home in
the Commonwealth there won’t be half the need for
it that there is to-day.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.W.W.; It received only a frigid welcome....
J. : Another addition to the awkward squad....
P.T.C.; Such an affectionate couple should be sitting
closer together... .U.R.H.: The arrangement of the
group has evidently been copied from a pawnbroker’s
window... .F.E.A.: It was noble of the copper, but
it doesn’t make a picture 8.D.R.: Hands and
feet are too large and clumsy... .W.J.D.: The
bleary-eyed prize-fighter was counted out... .M.T.0.:
Timorous little effort... .T.A.: The lady seems to
be in the grip of a serious wasting disease... .1.M.:
Arms don’t sprout from that part of the human
body... .R.P.: The frisky curate oughtn’t, to be let
out after dalk.... B.A. J.: Better those samples, and
you may get in.

ing a stride across the Tasman to establish

than lie does in Australia, whilst the tariff
against the imported confectionery (Aus-

“Adamascus”: Australia will soon be
showing U.S.A. specimens of the cotton it
can grow. An exhibit has been prepared for
the New York Exhibition —seven grades of
Queensland lint, including matured cotton
(fair to good) and immature seed (good
middling to middling). The cotton is Dur-
ango, impressed.

“Keppel”: When the gold rush to Cler-
mont (W.Q.) was on in the early days, there
were nine hotels on the old Westwood-road
within less than a mile. The teamsters kept
them going. But the building of the Western
railway line from Rockhampton put an end
to the pubs; now only one is left. Williams-
town (Vic.) is reputed to have seven and a
wineshop within a quarter-mile radius, but
Westwood’s pubs were all on a bush road
with no settlers for miles.
* * * *
“Dr. Nil”: If J. R. Collison, lately dead,
aged 85, really was “the first to introduce
rabbits into Australia” he must have started
pretty young. When we lived in Notting-
ham (Eng.) in 1870 “Australian tinned
rabbit” —put up by either Travers and Co.
or the Ramornie works—occurred very often
on our table; so did tinned kangaroo, and,
of course, Australian tinned mutton. They
were all much superior to most of the tinned
meat procurable nowadays. Or perhaps I
was much younger and hungrier.
“Ben Zine”: Dairy produce from M.L. is
exported in white-pine boxes and crates at
a cost to the country of about £400,000 p.a.
White pine is an indigenous timber without
taint, and as the visible supply of it is less
than a thousand million super, feet, and the
cutting rate at present is 60 million, the
cow cocky of the Shivery Isles will soon be
looking round for a substitute. There is a
fortune awaiting the inventor of a ■dairy-
product container to replace white pine; it
must have lightness combined with strength
and rigidity, and be free from flavoring ten-
dencies.
* * * *
“Machete” : Mark Gosling, M.L.A., missed
his putt when he told the Ma State’s Assem-
bly that steel railway carriages “were de-
signed for tube railways, and not for a semi-
tropical country.” They were originally
designed for the trans-American run from
New York to San Francisco, a line that
traverses some of the hottest country on
earth. They are used on S’African rail-
ways, and are generally estimated as 50
per cent, safer in accidents than wooden car-
riages ; they do not splinter or catch fire
readily. It is doubtful if they are hotter
than the wooden carriages, and the proba-
bility is that Mark’s numerous wood-work-
ing constituents have a good deal to do with
the fuss he is raising.

“Huon” : That the Sydney apple-market is
lost to Tassie orchardists for keeps unless
they learn some of the elements of honesty
was the text of a sermon preached to the
Fruit Advisory Board of the Speck recently
by A. J. Cooper. Cooper spoke as one having
authority, for he is chairman of the com-
mittee of agents who handle Tassie fruit in
the Harbor City. He drove home his point
with a long string of horrible examples of
picked things done by misguided apple-
farmers. There was one occasion when 50
cases of apples when properly re-packed
amounted to 35 cases of apples and 15 cases
of superfluous packing. The wrong brand-
ing of cases, with intent to get a better
price than the fruit could command, was too
prevalent, and the packing of Tasmania’s
other fruit was too often as bad as could be.

“Black Tracker”: The almond crop of
South Australia, which is regarded as one of
the most profitable side-lines for the land-
owner, owes its origin to the purchase of
a pennyworth of nuts by a lad in the early
days of the State. This lad, now one of
the State’s most enterprising pastoralists—
Brooks by name —claims to be the boy con-
cerned. The almonds, fortunately, were of the
soft-shell variety then recently first imported
from abroad. He received for his copper
three nuts, two of which his father annexed
and planted. Both produced fine trees. The
land on Which they were grown was sold
to a man named Brandis, who sold and dis-
tributed them as “Brandis almonds,” the
title they hold to-day. Brooks docs not
envy the man his luck, but thinks the
almonds should have been called by his
name.
* * * *
“Avon” : One of the practices of banking
in most parts of the world is that cheques
paid in are not credited to a client’s account
until they are “cleared” by the bank on
which they are drawn. The Post Office
Savings Bank in Maoriland —a source .from
which the Government unobtrusively does
a lot of borrowing—has overlooked the rule,
and as a consequence a law clerk named
Baume was able recently, by paying in cheques
and making speedy withdrawals,, to get
£llOO handed out to him over the counter on
the strength of a cash deposit of £3. A
touch of the unusual was added to an other-
wise drab case by the fact that Baume used
a dead-beat named Smith, whom he had
befriended, as his catspaw. Baume, who
was under age, was given three years in
a Borstal Institute, and Smith is to have
a year’s reformative treatment.
* * * #
“Avon” : A Melbourne inventor named Ko-
biolke claims to have devised a way of cir-
cumventing the timber-chewing proclivities of
the white ant and all other wood-eating in-
sects, and also of checkmating the dried-fruit
moth, which destroys a sizable proportion of
Australian currant exports. The method
of treatment is to put the timber —or the
cased fruit—in a receptacle in which a
vacuum is created, after which suitable gases
are admitted. In the case of timber there
is also a treatment with oil. It is claimed
that green timber can be seasoned by this
process in nine days—it takes about 18
months in the open—as well as being made
so impervious to borers that treated timber
which was left for three months in a white-
ant heap came out unscathed. If these things
be true and the processes commercially
practicable some of Australia's worst en-
emies will bite the dust.


Why Studebaker Offers
More for the Money
BECAUSE all vital costly parts —bodies, engines, steering
gears, clutches, differentials, gear boxes, springs, axles,
brakes, grey iron castings and drop forgings are made in Stude-
baker’s own great factories, great savings are effected. Stude-
baker eliminates the extra profits which others must pay to
outside parts and bodymakers.
The savings Studebaker effects through One-Profit manufac-
ture are returned to the product in better materials, finer work-
manship.
A few significant facts show how this benefits the buyer. One-
third of the cost of a car is in the body and Studebaker, by
building all its own bodies, builds better bodies and at the
same time effects savings of as much as £5O per car. One-fifth
of the cost of a car is in the engine. Studebaker builds all its
engines complete in its own great factories. Studebaker makes
all its own grey iron castings. It produces better castings than
it was able to buy outside, yet saves 25% in their cost.
In some models, these savings which Studebaker returns to the
product reach a total of as much as £lOO. Therefore, Stude-
baker is able to give you a better car for the money.
Studebaker cars are built as a unit and therefore function as
a unit. This results in smooth harmonious operation, greater
riding comfort, longer life and higher resale value.
Because all phases of manufacture are directly under Stude-
baker control, Studebaker cars are constantly kept up-to-date.
Improvements are continually made—not saved up for spec-
tacular announcements which makes cars artificially obsolete.
Resale values are thus stabilized.

Nowadays when suburbs are springing up
around the fringes of Sydney like mushrooms,
and municipal authorities work overtime
thinking up names for new streets, “Wilson’s
Street Directory” is indispensable to those
who are compelled to make journeys to
strange destinations. Its usefulness and
accuracy have been recognised now for 2d
years.
Touching a recent mention of Dr. M. J.
O’Reilly’s qualifications as a versifier, a few
years ago the massive rector of St. John’s
within the University of Sydney published
a book of poems and presented one of the
first copies to his old friend and class-mate
Archbishop Mannix. The acknowledgment
came along promptly: “Received your book
of verse with thanks. Shakspeare will do
me.”
“E.F.N.”: Though there are many tee-
totallers who are anti-prohibitionists, and
many prohibitionists who are not teetotallers,
a prohibitionist publican must be a rare bird.
Tne recent by-elections in Queensland have
brought one to light in John O’Keefe, who
becomes M.L.A. for Chillagoe, Theodore’s
old seat. The new member runs the Aus-
tralian Hotel at Irvinebank and is chairman
of the Walsh Shire Council.
Frank O’Hara, prominent athlete, foot-
baller and amateur boxer of Cairns (N.Q.),
has taken the count in Brisbane. A son of
Dennis O’Hara, carly-day Cairns publican,
Frank was widely known in the North. His
last appearance in public was when he fought
and had the best of four gruelling rounds
with the bare ’uns in a scrap with a leading
local watersidcr—a sequel to the rotary dis-
pute on the Cairns water-front.
On his recent picture-making expedition
to the North Frank Hurley found German
Harry still living on Deliverance Island,
Torres Strait, though there had been rumors
of his death. Harry once spent seven years
without seeinga white man, but lately his spells
of solitude have not been quite so long. It
was, however, so long since he had had occa-
sion to talk to anyone that he had almost
forgotten how to speak. His tongue was very
rusty when Hurley first blew in, but after
a little while he recovered the use of it.
“Nest” : Reference to Corporal Williams,
the “Autograph King” (B. 11/2/’26), re-
minds me that Williams and his pal West-
wood, who were in my section, invited celeb-
rities to write their names on a strip of
silk, which was afterwards sewn to a Union
Jack. The pair were keen members of the
Salv'army, and it was a common thing in
the streets of Andover to see their auto-
graphed flag spread on the ground in the
ring, the crowd being exhorted to put a bob
on Kitchener, or sixpence on King George.
Sydney Worker, probing for reasons why
the Leg. Council Abolition Bill was held
back, collects a number. For example
It the Governor were asked to make 10 new
appointments, and the names were not published
while the A.L.P. convention was sitting, it would
be a simple matter to make 50 delegates dream that
they’d be in the lucky bum h. And 50 votes sub-
ject to this inspiration would probably mean the
election of a Ministerial ticket to A.L.P. executive
positions.
There is one member who will lose a lucrative
post when the Council goes.
Mr. Willis will now sing “Perhaps i!
was right to dissemble your love, but why
did you put in the boot?”
“Wingella”: The Northern Territory has
had more than its share of capitals. The
first was established at Fort Dundas, Mel-
ville Island, in 1824. The second came into
being at Fort Wellington, Raffles Bay, in
1527, and the third at Victoria, Port Essing-
ton, in 1887. A fourth followed at Escape
Cliffs, Adam Bay, in 1864; and a fifth at
Southport, Port Darwin, before Palmerston,
Port Darwin, was chosen in IS7O. Now
there are suggestions that another capital
should be made at Newcastle Waters. If
only half the energy expended in creating
capitals had been spent in building railways,
the N.T. might not be so far behind in the
struggle.
With the departure of A. E. Hyland for
England to take over the £l5OO job of pushing
the forthcoming Australian-products sales
campaign, Vic. Railway Commissioner Clapp
loses his chief slogan writer. Hyland, who has
just turned 40, organised the Better Farming
and Reso trains and has been the live wire
behind all Clapp’s raisin, bread, fruit and
Buffalo boosting stunts, besides acting as
chairman of the departmental Betterment
Board:. His energy and enthusiasm are
astounding in a Government official. He has
been known to walk down Collinss-street
dictating an urgent report to a secretary.
Officially he has only been “loaned” by Clapp
for three years, but if he ever returns to his
old £7OO job, things won’t seem the same.
The Bulletin’s old sub-editor, Wilfred
Blacket, K.C., has been giving a Sydney
paper some reminiscences of David
Buchanan, probably the hardest case of all
hardease N.S.W. advocates. But he over-
looked one. David had been defending with
his usual whole-souled zeal a man who had
set him a tough problem. The accused was
acquitted ; and subsequently, at a gathering
of gents, one, the opinion was generally
expressed that the verdict was right. Only
Buchanan was sceptical, and it was naturally
suggested that he probably knew more than
the others. “It’s no’ that,” David said;
“but if he w r as innocent, why should he come
to the man wdio was most like to get him
off if lie was guilty?”
T. S. Harrison, who is retiring from the
Commonwealth Public Service owing to ill-
health, has made more money than he can
remember. He took on the job of engraving
the Commonwealth’s bank-notes in 1912.
Before he left London that year the Repub-
lic of Nicaragua, for whom he had previously
made a heap of picture money, sought liis
services. Equally impressed with his ability
wms tlie Chinese Government, which offered
him the equivalent of £3OOO per annum.
Neither of these countries, however, appealed
to him as being healthy for note-printers.
Descended from a race of craftsmen, he ac-
quired his skill from his father, who was
an engraver for the Bank of England. To-
gether they made the first bank cheques that
were proof against forgery—cheques that
smudged and became worthless at the touch
of acid or water.

Conqueror Of The Mongouan Wilds
Dr, Roy Chapman Andrews, who startled the
world a few years ago by discovering a nest of
dinosaur eggs ten million years old, arrived in
New York on November 9th from his Third
Asiatic Expedition under the auspices of the
American Museum of Natural History.
Again he attributes much of the success of his
expedition to the astounding performance of his
five Dodge Brothers Motor Cars.
Following is a direct quotation from an official
statement by Dr. Andrews upon his return to
America:
The Gobi Desert in Mongolia is the most
extensive undeveloped and unexplored re-
gion now left in the world. Until a few
years ago it was retarded by the impossibly
slow traffic of camel trains, the only means
of communication.
But now it is being crisscrossed in every
direction by motor cars, or, more correctly
by one motor car, the Dodge. Sixty or
seventy Dodge Brothers cars are making
regular trips far into the interior of this vast
waste, bringing out loads of sables, precious
furs, wool and other products.
No other car except the Dodge is found there
because we have tried it out on each of our
three expeditions and have had it demon-
strated to our satisfaction that the Dodge
is the only car that will stand up under the
strain of the roadless desert and do every-
thing we ask of it.
Few people have occasion to subject their motor
cars to punishment of this severity. It is reassur-
ing, however, to know that in emergencies Dodge
Brothers Motor Car is built to meet the test.
These dependable and sturdy qualities also ac-
count for the fact that more than 90% of all the
motor cars Dodge Brothers have built during the
past eleven years, are still in active service.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LVY me down and leave me lightly
Where the tall trees bending over
From a sky that burns too brightly
Cloak at last a crippled rover.
Let them whisper there above me
All their pity and their wonder.
An you hate not, an you love me,
Have no human grieving blunder
On my solitary wending
To that dim, unreckoned haven;
Whether pain or peace the ending,
Let no keening make me craven.
For the wayfarer is weary
Of the white roads, crossing ever.
Blind the path ahead and eerie
To the black, eternal river,
But in pity let the parting
Lose in wreaths and gain in roses —•
As you smiled at dawn and starting,
Smile again as darkness closes!
All the ways of earth I wandered,
Every sea and sun have known me.
All my days on mirth I squandered;
Need it no.w, at last, disown me?
Lay me down and leave me, jesting;
Let no sorrow linger after.
On my last and lonely questing
I would bear with me your laughter!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY father had not been in his grave
six months before that ass (Hovelling
started to pay attention to my
mother. He is well-lined, and most people
say he is a decent enough chap. I think he
is an ass. I positively loathe the man. Call
it CEdipus complex, if the name amuses you.
The feeling remains. I think it has some-
thing to do with the fact that I still cherish
a memory of a splendid man—-my father —
his lovely wife and the very splendid life they
led together. However, there it is; and to
save myself the necessity of kicking Clovell-
ing down the stairs I took my mother on this
Java trip. I thought it might help her to
fox-get him, or at least bring back the memory
of her former husband. And so, after doing
Java, we came to Bali, the Hindu island
alongside, which has only recently been
“pacified.”
“Bali’s a queer country,” said the chief
officer, “and Ma’ Patimalx is the one to
show you the qxieerness of it.” Ma’ Patimah
as he was speaking had come on board, and
when she commenced smacking the chief
on his ample stern we knew that we stood
in the presence of no ordinary woman. She
wore a transparent gauze kabaya fastened
with English sovereigns and American gold
eagles; round her waist was a sarong of the
real batik, painted with modern steamships
standing on their heads; her hair was twisted
behind into a gigantic loop like a teapot-
handle, and her face, though flat and pock-
marked, was distinguished.
“Ma' Patimah was a widow like yourself
once, mevrouw,” said the chief to my mother.
“They used to burn their widows in Bali,
and if it wasn’t for us they’d be burning them
still. Have you ever seen a human body
burn while it’s alive? No? Well, I’ve seen
plenty. In the old days. Just like a green
log, madam. Phut, phut, sither! Spurts of
fiery gas. Greenish usually, but sometimes
blue. Ma’ Patimah will tell you all about
it.”
It was not the first time I had been in
Bali, but the place had changed. In my
day there were only tracks, and now there
were fine high-roads with motors on
them. Msx’ Patimah owned one of the
motors and let it out for hire. She also let
hei-self with it and threw in the story of
her life to make good measure. Sitting in
Patimah’s motor, speeding from one temple
to another, we drew the story without any
difficulty from her.
It was the tailpiece to an old chapter
in the turbulent liistoi-y of that rococo islxind,
and it was also the headpiece to a new. At
fourteen years of age Patimah had been
wedded to a rajah. The distinction was not
so valuable, since he was already wedded
to twenty-four other spouses. In the fierce
battle for supremacy in the harem, however,
Patimah had it all her own way. It was
not in her nature to play second wife to any
woman, but a whimpering wliippersnapper
of a lesser concubine presented her syndi-
cated lord with his first man-child and Pati-
mah was dethroned. It was something she
had not provided for. Her declension to the
status of a domestic slave soon followed, and
her strangling and throwing over the palace
wall was only a matter of amicable arrange-
ment among the other women, when the
sudden demise of the rajah consigned the
whole twenty-four to a common doom.
“For you see, nyonya,” said Ma’ Patimah
to my mother, “in those days wives thought
it a great honor to be burned for their dead
husbands’ greater glory,” and she chuckled,
while my mother smiled her Mona Lisa
smile.
Patimah was not that sort of woman. She
had no intention of accompanying her lord
to Sworga if she could help it. There were
Dutchmen in Singaradja on the far side
of the island, and Dutchmen, she had heard,
were only too glad to leave their unprepos-
sessing spouses on this earth when they went
aloft. So she got two faithful nurses to
throw a rope over the palace wall, and
Patimah shinned up the rope and got away.
The young man who as an unborn baby
accompanied his enterprising mother in her
escape from the funeral pyre was the driver
of our car. He was a fat, gold-faced youth
in European clothes with a Malay kopeia
stuck jauntily sideways on his head. He
punctuated his mother’s story with appreci-
ative smiles. “I would be a dead baby now
if it had not been for her,” he grinned, and
my mother smiled her dark-bright smile and
said he was a lucky fellow.
_We swung up into the mountains, and the
rain began to fall, as it always does up in
the mountains. The endless succession of
irrigated rice-fields, like burnished mirrors,
gave place to jungle, with here and there the
mud wall of a village, the sombre and mys-
terious temple-village of Bali. Above the
walls the innumerable shrines smoked with
incense. Ex-votos of bamboo nodded above
the roadway, dangling strange emblems ot
the gods. The queer split gateways writhed
with shapes of gods and demons—slavering,
long-tusked gaping mouths, clawing hands,
great pop-eyes under scowling _ brows, the
apotheosis in stone of a nation’s horror ot
the hereafter. Night, creator of these terrors,
came down swiftly, and we bored through
a darkness stabbed by lightnings. Rain
drummed sharply on our hood, and the stuffy
atmosphere inside the car was full of
the loud hum of our engine roaring on top
gear. In front Ma’ Patimah sat drowsing
by the side of her son, and alongside me my
mother nodded to the bouncing of the springs
and smiled enigmatically to herself under
sleepy eyelids.
Suddenly the car stopped with a jerk,
nearly throwing us on the floor. I caught a
quick glimpse of Ma’ Patimah’s son jumping
with wonderful agility into the darkness,
and then our door opened and the night
budded half a dozen native faces.
Everything happened after that with sur-
prising decision and despatch.
First they showed us a nasty-looking)
knife, which stopped my protests ; then they
showed us marked politeness, explaining
that they would continue to do so as long
as we did what we were told and without
asking any questions. Consequently, in a
few moments we found ourselves standing
in the rain amongst what seemed a universe
of savage faces ; next our baggage was taken
out of the car and carefully bestowed upon
the backs of coolies; last we were invited
to step into covered litters which burly men
in loincloths briskly hoisted on to their
shoulders.
Ma’ Patimah had gone on before. When
last we saw her she was being carried,
gently but firmly, into the darkness while
her voice raised in protest lingered long
after in our ears. Our litters began to
move. We felt ourselves plunging down-
wards in the darkness. Boughs swept us
on either side and the rain pattered above
our heads. After what seemed an intermin-
able journey we heard the roar of water
and felt our bearers begin to step gingerly,
while spray stung our faces. Then we rose
again and the roar receded. Suddenly the
litters were put down.
An old man who may have been a priest
invited us to step out and guided us along
the rocky passage into a room of sorts.
There were a couple of bamboo beds against
the wall and a kerosene lamp—the sort the
Shell Co. distributes free to stimulate the
sale of its oil —lighted the chamber dimly.
The old man left us and we sat down to wait
for the day. We could have escaped—there
was no door—but where could we have
escaped to? So we sat and waited. The lamp
used up its oil, spluttered and went out and
still we sat and waited. My mother made no
complaint—she never does —and in the dark-
ness I could almost feel that quiet introspec-
tive smile of hers. At last the cell went grey
instead of black and we knew it must be
morning. Then the old man came and led
us out.
As we threaded our way along those
mouldy cloisters, a murmur we had listened
to all night swelled to a roar and we came
into the sunlight.
What we saw was a scene to be remem-
bered. Stretching from the foot of the
temple wherein we had spent the night and
which had been hollowed out of the solid
cliff, a huge shelf of rock like a gigantic
proscenium jutted out over a tremendous
gorge. In the centre of this natural stage
surrounded by its amphitheatre of green
and dripping cliffs stood a gaudy pagoda of
painted wood, paper and tinsel shaped in the
form of the garuda, the eagle vehicle of
Vishnu. Between its soaring wings swung
a small staging which was connected to the
ground by an inclined way of matting and
bamboo. The native architect was no mean
artist, and the great bird, tawdry as he
was, seemed about to soar up between the
walls of the ravine into the blue sky above.
Men were feverishly piling bundles of
painted faggots at his foot and bare-breasted
women were hurrying up with curiously
shaped offerings in enormous tiers upon their
heads. I was startled to discover that the
flat shelf of rock was packed with people,
a silent audience squatting motionless upon
their heels.
Where the platform contracted into a
narrow pathway round the base of the cliff a
procession straggled into view. First a
crowd of women marching proudly witlx
more offerings on their heads ; then a group
of priests in white skirts with cords across
their naked chests; then an agitated rabble
bearing ceremonial umbrellas aloft, like a
garden of flamboyant blossoms harried by
the wind. Under the largest and most
flamboyant walked Ma’ Patimah leaning on
the arm of her son.
The stout young motor-driver was mar-
vellously transformed. On his head was a
rajah’s head-dress, x'ound his waist was a
sarong of the royal yellow, on his fat lips
was a smile of positively regal arrogance
and pride. His mother, on the other hand,
although she was arrayed like a young bride,
looked pitifully old and feeble. All the self-
confidence of a successful business woman
was gone. Her face was a deathlike mask,
her eyes were fixed and staring and she
stumbled blindly forward. Every now and
then her son threw glances at her, not of
commiseration, bxit of anxiety. He seemed to
want to hurry her along.
When the procession got close to the fan-
tastic erection in the centre of the stage
it stopped. A dozen priests rushed up and
flung garlands of flowers over Ma’ Patimah’s
shoulders. A look of ineffable contentment
suffused the yellow features of her son as
he took his mother’s hand and began to lead
her up the ramp. A gong began to throb
with a sickening sound, a tremendous shout
went up from the watching crowd and a
wholly naked man, yelling wildly, ran out
from nowhere and plunged a blazing torch
into the mass of tinder at the foot of the
tower.

THE PENALTY OF OVERWORK
Many People are Beginning to Feel the Strain
The heavy tax of overwork, the extra strain so
necessary to many trades and occupations, is hard
on the kidneys. The kidneys fail in their work
and the poisonous matter collects in the system.
If your wod- seems hard for you, if you have a
lame, weak or aching back, if you seem tired and
listless, if you notice sediment in the urine,
unnatural color, or irregular passages, and seem
to be running down without apparent cause, begin
at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the
remedy that has proved so beneficial to your
neighbors. It has brought strength to the backs
of thousands of working men and women. Sydney
proof is given here.

If “Every Picture

A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Trott, “Fairview,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when I
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and they worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with the treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid. Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
free of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”

still free from this trying complaint.”

A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petersham, Sydney,
says: “Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered
kidneys, and, as a result suffered agony from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body. I was often so bad that
I could hardly get about the house, evei’y movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
I had no energy for anything, and was really far from well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and
after taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me, and I
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.”

It was then we fully understood what
was about to happen.
“Oh, stop them,” wailed my mother; “it
simply can’t go on.”
“Here, you dirty swine,” I bellowed and
started for the pyre.
Then I was shown a glimpse of the real
temper of that apparently apathetic crowd.
A score of hands reached out and pulled me
down before I had gone a dozen steps.
Brown fingers gripped my mouth and the
rest of my protest died in gabble while I
lay helpless on my back, watching from that
undignified position that abominable scoun-
drel carefully assisting his mother to the
sacrifice.
The atrocious creature! Through the black
smoke and the tempest of flame on which
the great bird of Vishnu seemed to be sweep-
ing to Heaven, I could see the ex-chauffeur's
happy smile mounting upwards alongside
Ma’ Patimah’s melancholy mask. As they
reached the staging somebody pushed out a
narrow plank like a diving-board. It nodded
gently over the red heart of the flame and
Ma’ Patimah was shown where to put her
feet on it. She moved along it mechanically
as iff she were under the influence of a drug,
as indeed she probably was. Her feet had
shuffled almost to the end when a breath
from the furnace underneath suddenly' licked
across her face. She shrank backwards like
a leaf and half turned to retreat. Then I
saw something that made me rise shouting
to my feet with half a dozen natives cling-
ing to me. That diabolical fat progeny of
hers had leant ‘ forward w ith w 7 hat looked
like a long lance in his hand and pricked
his mother from behind. Ma’ Patimah

Then I woke. The car w r as still boring
upwards through the rain, and Ma’ Pati-
mah still sat in front staring before her,
while her son leaned back with a cigarette
in his mouth and one careful hand conning
the car’s career. My mother’s dark eyes
were closed and her handsome lips were
softly smiling
Well, I suppose I shall have to try to

Aunt Floie’s Homecoming.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Bryson girls had been brought up
to look on marriage as the essential
thing in a woman’s career. If she did
not marry it was because no one had asked
her, and if no one had asked her it was
because she was unattractive, and that was
the crowning sin.
If she were not attractive naturally, she
must devise means to make herself so arti-
ficially.
She might cajole, she might flatter, she
might win a man by fair means or foul; she
might even make a runaway match (Grand-
ma Bryson herself had made one), but marry
she must. Grandma Bryson’s romantic old
spirit was at the bottom of it. If she had
been a man she would have been a highway-
man or a pirate, or at least a Chief Justice,
but, being only a woman, she eloped.
To be an old maid seemed to her the
height of depravity and dullness. Her scorn
for women who took up professions was
unbounded.
Marriage saved complications, she thought,
and the best way to pull the strings was
through your husband. These new-fangled
notions were sending women from service to
slavery. Grandma Bryson, from her nodding
white head to her small, impatient feet, was
very emphatic about it.
But the best-brought-up families have
their old maids, and the Bryson family -was
no exception. Aunt Floie had defied the
family tradition and remained single.
Of course, Grandma Bryson now being
dead, she lived with one of the Brysons
junior. Where else would she live? Her
vocation was to pull strings, and, having
none of her own to pull, she pulled those of
the junior Brysons.
Her sister-in-law was a temperamental
little person, given to sudden outbursts of
emotion, even hysteria. She forgot to set
the alarm-clock when Mr. Bryson had to go
into town early; she forgot to leave the key
under the mat when, she went out, and re-
turned to find her entire family waiting at
the door to get in ; she put mustard on the
children’s lunch-sandwiches, and they hated
mustard.
This w 7 as when Aunt Floie’s strings got
tangled. When they were pulling straight
the Brysons progressed swimmingly.
Wherever she was most w 7 anted, there
Aunt Floie seemed to be, but of course the
only time you noticed it was when she
icasn’t.
You accepted tier and counted on her,
and w r ere fond of her in a patronising-
though not too patronising—way.
Thirty-five, golden-haired, even-tempered,
with a little whimsically tender smile, ob-
viously she “dated.” Obviously she was the
old maid of the family. She was too useful,
too unobtrusive, too unselfish to be anything
else. You simply couldn’t imagine her as
anything but just “Aunt Floie.”
Then suddenly, w'liile on a visit to Sydney,
Aunt Floie had fallen ill! Aunt Floie, who
was never ill, not for a day !
A Macquarie-street doctor had ordered her
a complete rest for twelve months in the
Blue Mountains, and—extraordinary treat-
ment —during that time she was to see none
of her relatives.
It almost gave the junior Brysons nervous
prostration. They were in fearful commo-
tion. The youngest Bryson refused to eat
his porridge because Aunt Floie w r as not
there to tell him the tale of the bear that
was eating it faster than he from underneath.
It was always there just as Aunt Floie had
said, but with any of the others it might turn
out to be a plain white plate, and then the
youngest Bryson w 7 ould howl lustily, for
what is the use in hurrying to eat one’s por-
ridge unless there is a bear eating it faster
underneath?
The eldest Bryson couldn’t finish a jumper
because there was no Aunt Floie to help her
with the pattern.
Mrs. Bryson wept, and Mr. Bryson got an
enlarged liver.
After a time they began to settle down to
a world without Aunt Floie in it. Bhe
w 7 rote cheerfully; said she felt better already ;
quite ten years younger; had discovered a
new and much more becoming way of doing
her hair, and was crocheting a mauve silk
dress for herself.
Aunt Floie ! Hair ! Dresses !.. . . After
all she had hair and wore dresses, hut ....
“She might do some sewing for the child-
ren, now she has so much spare time,” said
George Bryson.
Mrs. Bryson sighed. “One doesn’t have
much time to think about doing one’s hair
differently after one is married,” she mused.
Mr. Bryson looked pained. “You’d better
try a little port wine with your meals, Con-
stance,” he said, as though that proved some-
thing. The old maid of the family had no
business to be so upsetting. He was keep-
ing his end up, goodness knows, with seven
children to feed and educate....
But now the year was over, more than
over, and Aunt Floie was coming back. A
sigh of thankfulness went up from the junior
Brysons. They prepared a grand -welcome
for her. The Brysons had always made much
of family festivals.
Mr. Bryson brought out the big red-and-
white “Welcome Home” banner that had been
used when the soldiers returned from the
Great War, also from the Boer War; also
oil many state occasions betwmen. It had
become quite an heirloom. They nailed
“Welcome Home” over the front door, and
decorated the gate with flags. They made a
large rainbow-cake and wrote “Welcome
Home” on it in pink icing, and the youngest
Brysons made her a fat green pincushion and
wrote “Welcome Home” on it in pins.
Aunt Floie was to have a home-coming
worthy of the name of Bryson.
She was to arrive by car—unheard of
extravagance; but, then. Aunt Floie had
been ill.
At the appointed hour the entire junior
Bryson household swarmed upon the gravel
drive in front of the house. Poor, dear Aunt
Floie! They would show her how they loved
her !.. . . How they had missed her !
With a swish the ear swept under the
triumphal flags, and in it, looking as pretty
as a picture, and wearing the smartest
clothes, sat Aunt Floie. She was holding
a queer-shaped bundle in her arms. A thrill
ran through the Brysons.
Presents!
Aunt Floie waved and beamed, and cried
greeting to them all, and then, without get-
ting out of the car, she opened the queer-
shaped bundle, and disclosed a tiny, red-faced
baby!
With one accord the junior Brysons’ jaws
fell open in a prodigious gape, and nine
gasps went up as one.
Mr. Bryson’s jaws were the first to close
—with a snap.
“What is this, Floie?” he cried in a
strange voice.
“My baby,” said Aunt Floie sweetly, hold-
ing him up.
“Isn’t he a duck? I can’t help thinking
he’s like you, George. That’s what I shall
call him.”
Tin l young Brysons were clambering all
over the car and Aunt Floie and the baby.
“That you won’t!” bawled George Bryson.
“Get off, you children! Do you hear me?
What do you mean. Floie? Is this the reason
for your illness and leaving us so suddenly?”
“This is the reason,” said Aunt Floie
serenely, wrapping young George up again in
his shawl.
And then Mrs, Bryson had hysterics. First
she laughed wildly, shrilly, and then she
cried, and then she laughed again.
“My God !” said George Bryson.
“Go into the house, children!” lie roared.
“Fetch me some brandy, ice, whisky, anti-
phlogistine!”
“I think,” said Aunt Floie to the chauf-
feur, “we had better drive to the hotel.”
“I think so !” roared George Bryson, shak-
ing his wife. “I think so!”
The car snorted, backed and turned.
“When my husband arrives this evening,
George, you can say I have gone to the
hotel.”
“Husband!” shouted George Bryson, and
Mrs. Bryson’s hysterics ceased for a moment
and then began again worse than ever, and
all the children, like a crowd of scared rab-
bits, came running out of the house with
smelling-salts and eau-de-Cologne.
“Yes, Dr. Armytage. He’s such a dear,”
called Aunt Floie, and as the car spun again
under the triumphal flags she turned to wave,
saw them all standing under the “Welcome
Home” banner and smiled her sw 7 eet enig-
matical smile.

Tli<‘ distant city clock struck three.
The house was hushed; the primrose dawn
Delayed beyond the hills: the lawn,
The leaves and buds I could not see
Were dewy-dark with mystery.
So still it was I did not dare
To break the silence brooding there.
At height of noon the clock struck one.
The air was murmurous with bees;
The birds outpoured their rhapsodies
In adoration of the sun.
Of green and gold the raiment spun
To dress the garden—every flower
Rejoiced in that resplendent hour.
Where jessamine and roses climb
The sunset glory lingers late;
The clock is slowly striking eight.
Enchanted moment! Magic time !
Petunia perfume to the chime
Pervades the night that lies aswoon
With rapture ’neath the rising moon.
The bells ring out and sink once more
To silence. Each succeeding hour
Is rich with beauty. Priceless dower
And wealth of wonder, scented store
Of color wait without the door.
A gift of joy, a king’s largesse,
Sun-gold and blossom loveliness!
VICTORIA.
ETHEL MARTYE.

MALTESE CROSS
WAX. VE/TA/'
They come to you in a neat, easily-pocketed box. They strike
anywhere, hold their flame in the wind and burn longer than their
wooden rivals.
The outdoor man with a pipe to light when the breeze is blowing
swears by (not at) MALTESE CROSS MATCHES.
You should use them too.
