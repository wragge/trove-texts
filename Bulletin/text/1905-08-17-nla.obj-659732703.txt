*I il RE, Mieko, you watch the I ring
ly j while.l.talk ter the gent.
** Not as they need any watchin’ ; they ’re
as quiet as ! lambs : I look after
that. Yes; I should say there’s over a hundred
here, an’ it ain’t a full school. My profit ? Runs
about 30 quid a week. I reckon 50 quid’s a real
good week. Race weeks I clear 100 quid. There s
no expenses once the ! thing’s started,
leastways none ter speak of. The blokes about
the school gets their little cut from the winners,
same as me. When I see a bloke has been headin’
’em three or four times I may give him a hint:
“How’s things, Rab-oh?”—or something like
that, an’ he tosses me a couple of bob. The blokes
knows what s expected o’ them, an’ they would n’t
treat me mean, ’cos they ! well knows I
wouldn’t stand it. So one way an’ another it’s
pretty fair ! sailin’.
Takes a bit of ! management, though. The
Johns are the biggest expense, ! ! ! .
I’ve got to make it easy fot them. O’ course we ’re
ready any time they come up : plenty of barbed
wire an’ all-that, an’ a couple of good ! men
on so if they did get in they just find us a-
playin the planner, an’ havin’ what you call a bit
o’ social jollification. But I ain’t frightened of no
1 raids. We’ve got it down toa ! system.
Yes ; the raids do come off. You read about ’em
in the papers. We had one only week before
last. I’d been out ter get a bit of tea, and I
was cornin’ down ter open the school when I spots
th’ 1 on the corner. I says, “Hullo,
[Eustace]!’’ an’ he says, “Hullo, [Algernon]!”
an’ I says, “Wantin’ me/ ” an’ he says, “Yes, it’s
up ter you again.” No good making a ! !
fuss about it; so I arsts him “ When’s it
goin’ ter come off?” “What d’ye say ter ter-
morrow night ?” he says. “ Well,” I says, “ make
it th’ night after ter-morrow. .We’ll have a big
school on ter-morrow, an’ a few chaps down from
the country, an’ I want ter let ’em have a
good ! game.” “Alright!” hesays, “that’ll
do me ! ” So we fixes it, an’ I hands him over
the ! ! "!
■ Sorth’ next night I says ter the boys : “Boys,”
I says, “ it’s for ter-morrow night; which of vous
’ll take ten bob to stay for the; ! traps?”
About twenty of ’em said they was willin’, so I
fixed it, an’ about 8 o’clqck next night in comes
the ! traps—just knocks at th’ ! door
an’ walks, in. They know the way as well as I
do. We was all playin’ for matches, and when
[Eustace] says to me, “Are you the proprietor of
this here two-up: school ? ” I says: “ This ain’t a
two-up School. There ain t no money staked ! ”
He says, “ That’s too thin ! You ’ll just all come
along .with me.” So we goes along, an’ I bails
the ! lot out. We turns up at the !
court next mornin’, and the ! magistrate he
hears the -! case, an’ then he says: “Is
there anythin’ known about this man ?,” “ Well,”
says my friend [Eustace], “he bears a very good
character, your Wushup, but there is no doubt
that he runs a gambollin’ school !” “Fined five
pound!” says the '! magistrate; “I’m
determined to put this here gambollin’ down.”
The other blokes gets ten bob each. Cost me
about 40 quid altogether—a good week’s work.
But wot price [Cyril]? [Eustace] struck him just
the same as he struck me, and he would nit part a
! [Eustace] told me.. “ ! ”he says,
“ yous blokes won’t let a ! man make a
nonest living. You had me up only three months
ago, an’, s’elp me, times has been so ! bad
that I’ve done no trade at all ! ” That narked
[Eustace], an’ so he took him one ! night
when hewasn’t expecting. Rushed the place, made
a ' ! ; of a row, an’ got'about six blokes. The
others slid over the ! roofs.- They turns up
next day same as me. The ! magistrate he
hears the ! case, then he says : “ Anythin’
known about this man?” he says. “Yes, your
.Wushup,” says, [Eustace] “.very bad character :
about the worst character in my district. He is a
confirmed ganii boiler, leading all the young blokes
astray!” “Fined 100 pound, k” says the !
. magistrate. Blime ! I did laugh. You see it
don't pay to falFout'with the Johns. Treat ’em
fair an’ they ..treat you fair; that’s what I say.. .
Yousqe that there '' ! -ring-master: he’s got
to change all his clobber, right down to his !
socks, when’he comes into the ! ring, and
when he goes out. “ Why ? ” Because these here
sispicious ! blokes thinks that some of the
! dollars would, stick to him if he did n’t.
No, we never have any trouble here. Everybody’s
as good as ! gold. ’Casionally a bloke tries
to take a point. Well, if there s a dispute, we
arst the blokes as is sitting next him what’s
their opinion, and if they gives it for him
why he gets it. But we watch him, an’
if ne does it two or three times we just pass him
out, and as he’s passed out he gets a nasty tap.
Enough to knock him out for about six hours,
say ; as a reminder that this ! school is run
on the square. No, what’s won here is won
honestly. You don’t see. any ! gold about
because we don’t let s ’em have gold. When
a bloke is winning ! sovereigns he gets into
a way of slippin’ ’em in his 1 pocket, an’
presently he feels his winnings an’ clears out.
When he get|ut in silver he can’t count what he’s
won; so we makes ’em stick ter silver—it keeps
the ! money in the game. All the same,
there’s big money changin’ hands. See that
bloke over there: ’im with the broken conk :
that’s Bottle-oh, we call ’im ; he’s done well ter-,
night. “You going, Bottle-oh? Nobody leave
the room for five minutes.” Yer see, he’s got
about 30 quid on him ; won it since 8 o’clock;
’arf-past ten now. My bloke downstairs will put
him into a ! cab, and he ’ll get home alright.
But it wouldn’t be safe ter let some of these
! ! blokes here go out close after him.
This is a straight school. Everybody knows
that, an’ I doii’t have no funny business. What’s
more, if a bloke’s wife comes ter me an’ says he’s
a-neglectin’ his home or spendin’ more money
than he ought ter, I give him the word not ter
come again for a while, and he doesn’t come
neither. It’s the fairest kind of sport,
and I run it fair, an’ all the blokes
knows it. ’Souse me a moment: I want to say
a word to the boys. “ Hold on with that !
kip ’arf-a-mo’. Say, boys, yous all know there’s
to be e ! Cup run ter-morrer afternoon.
Yous had better all leave it alone. We ’ll start a
nice little school ’ere at ’arf-past two sharp, an’
have a ! sight better time than yous’ll get
at the ! Cup. ! the Cup,/say. That’s
all. Let ’er go, Ginger ! ”
Spring has scarcely “come in with suddenness,”
for in Australia we have had practically no
winter. The year has just turned-over in an
autumn doze and is awake again. The bards
must feel the surge : do they feel it vividly and
freshly ? Let us see in not mpre than 16 lines :
subject, “Spring”: 1 1. Is. offered for the best.
There must oe an Australasian reference : verses
to arrive before Sept. 4, endorsed “ Spring Poem.”

Lond. papers report fully the journalists’ libel
case—Moy Thomas v. H. W. Lucy. Both were a
long time on the staff of The Daily News ; and
brought away a mutual dislike. Moy Thomas
recently wrote up the recollections of the Jate Sir
John .Robinson, long Daily News editor; and
Lucy, who does book-notices for Punch, criti-
cised Fifty Years in Fleet-street savagely under
the heading “Mangled Remains.” 'Among other
kindly things, he said that the book had given a
new terror to death. Augustine Birrell, his
counsel, urged that
• Such an expression was usual among critics, and was
part of a critic’s o.ittit. It reminded one of the expres-
sion “chops and tomato sauce,” and was in the same
category.
Lucy also described the book as an unparalleled
atrocity, and said that Thomas had retold some
of Robinson’s cherished stories as if they were his
own, anil had with a heavy hand brushed off the
bloom. In his evidence he referred to Thomas as
“a struggling journalist,” an expression which
later he withdrew.
Re-examined.—All journalists struggled.
You are a struggling journalist yourself ?■—l was.
When did you leave off struggling?—Last night.
Punch expressed a qualified' regret for the article,
and expunged it from the bound volumes ; but did
not withdraw anything. Justice Darling, sum-
ming-up, said that
As to review of books, the reviewer had a protection
given him, and the more so, seeing that books were
usually, as in this case, sent gratuitously to papers in-
vjting criticism. Therefore if reviews were honestly and
fairly done, they were protected.
As to P'uneh —
They would see on the cover a picture of Punch himself,
and Punch had a dog named Toby. Mr. Lucy, taking the
position of Punch’s dog, got himself elected to Parlia-
ment, and there he barked impossible things under the
title of “ Toby, M. P. ”
Then the judge ingeniously quoted Goldsmith’s
“ Mad Dog at Islington ” :
The dog and man at first icere friends,
But when a pique began
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went vuid and bit the man.
Unlike many dogs that came into court, “ Toby, M.P.”
was not entitled to one bite.
The judge asked the jury to say whether the
criticism was fair or written with a desire to
injure the plaintiff— i.e., with malice; and the
jury apparently thought that personal ill-feeling
had swayed'Lucy's pen, for they found for plaintiff
with 30tM. damages.
Local amateurs of French literature are com-
mended to a well-informed notice of the De
Regniers in The Times weekly of July 7. As
regards classical French fiction, the writer takes
the view recently quoted here from T. de Visan,
and urges that the “ sigh of relief, ‘ Here at last is
a man who can write ! ’ ” is “ only too swiftly fol-
lowed by a sense of a quite extraordinary mental
and moral vacuum.”
The British Consul in Patagonia takes the
trouble to point out that Maoriland hasn’t “the
southernmost lamp post in the world.” That
portentous post, lie says, is at Usulmia, Tierra del
Fuego, in . 54’50 S. lat. Another illusion gone.

Hall Caine has been denying (1) that he said
the upper part of his face was like Bhakespear’s
and the lower part like Jesus Christ's ; (2) that he
“explained” Manx novels to King Edward for
two hours, and then knelt for knighthood and
was told to “ Get up, Mister ” i (3) everything else.

REMEMBRANCE
U 'V OST thou forbid me love ? Then cold thou
" Because all passion fain would be re-
quited ;
And cruel,’ because unsparing’ thou wouldst part
My soul from that dear aim whereto ’tis plighted;
And yet I cannot thitjk thy heart is hard,
-Looking upon its windows in thy face.
Wherein so great a tenderness is starred
And chill discretion has so little place :
Cruel I call thee,- dear, and coldly wise ;
But oh, the summer sweetness of thine eyes ! •>
11.
If kisses be more cruel things than blows,
And Spring as arid as December’s drouth,
And if a tinsel flower excels the rose
Or those twain crimson petals of thy mouth,
Or were denial sweeter than consent
And tenderness no dearer than disdain,
And a maid s kindness to a lover meant
Not to grant pleasure, but torment with pain—
Why, dear, I tell thee now, if these things be,
That then, and only then, thou ’rt kind to me.
111.
Now to make war upon thy heart of snow
My vow is sworn ; and I am out in arms,
To kindle thy fair face with passion’s glow,
And stir thy sleeping heart with love’s alarms ;
I ’ll move thee with hot pleadings, and I’ll net
Thy path with cunning snares of tangled rhyme,
Until thy traitorous thought, being so beset,
Is all in mutiny for the golden time ;
And then, being happiest e’en when conquered
most,
Ihou It turn thy face to mine, kiss, and be lost.
IV.
Outside a window where, with thoughts of you,
I sat, and in the sunlight idly dreamed,
Olive and laurel and arbutus grew,
And bees hummed endlessly. To me it seemed
Your lips were with a store of honey filled.
Sweeter indeed than theirs ; and every- song
Ihat my heart fashioned for you was distilled
Out of that sweetness. Only this was wrong :
Red like your lips the arbutus never sees,
But my rhyme cannot murmur with the bees,
v.
Behold, I make my heart a treasure chest
)r ' m ' y ith true love’s precious coin :
Wherein, as thy dear fancy pleases best,
I by hands, lips, eyes may all in plunder join.
Scatter its mintage to all winds that blow,
I’ll close no careful door to keep thee out;
Unrecompensed though many a tribute flow
(I he tax of distance and the waste of doubt,
The thefts of time, the unthrift of mad disdain)—
Thou ’lt find it ever full for thee again.
VI.
Out to the restless echoes of the night
Softly I speak your name ; the tender air
Lifts the faint whisper skyward ; its delight
Wakes murmuring leaves from languor every-
where ;
And upward flung, I watch where gleam on gleam
Crows sharply bright, flinging the music onward,
Louder as nearer heav'n ; until supreme
It swells the eternal strain that night sends
sunward ;
From the flying west to the mounting east, no
star is
But calls thy name to the dawn—“ Charis ! 0
Charisl ”
VII.
Now is the hope of both our lives, fulfilled,
And the bright glory of our love burns newly,
No more by proud discretion cramped and chilled,
But openly aflame, and nourished truly.
Not that faint whispered word, whose dear intent
First lit the torched in thy swimming eyes,
But love made perfect in enfranchisement,
Where heart no longer throbbing heart denies.
And our twin souls, long pent by wintry weather.
Are suddenly warmed, and bloom in red together.
VIII.
There is no minute of the day but hath
Some kind reminder of thy presence dear ;
Tlie,morning breezes touch me with thy breath,
And when the stars shine out, thine eyes are here ;
In whatsoe’er I do from hour to hour.
In what of glad or lonely fills my brain,
Thine image grows and brightens like a flower
Still drest and nourished or by sun or rain,
And through all else whatever changes run,
In my long love of thee prevai’leth none.
IX.
O count it not a fault that my long rhyme
So little tells what sweetness.in thee lies.
That thy mouth’s but a rose, thy breath is thyme,
And summer night no dearer than thine eyes,
But rather let its heaping-up of love
Be made the measure of thy worthfulness,
Lest faultily my picture should remove
One merit dear that any man may guess ;
So heart with heart to praise thee shall conspire,
To each the image of his own desire.
x.
Grave are thine eyes as is the queenly moon
When silently she moves across the night,
And soft thine accents as the breezes’ tune
That whisper praises of her image bright;
Yet can those eyes shine dewy as the morn,
That voice break sighing like a gusty wind,
When in thy heart a flush of love is born
And in my long embrace thou best resigned :
Thus all the living world—sun, moon, day, night—
Is like thee in its manifold delight.
XI.
That love thou didst with faltering tongue confess
And face on fire with shame to have it told,
Was it but stolen from thee in duress,
And being away, art thou so soon grown cold ?
If I broke thievishly upon thy peace,
And with strong fraud thine innocent heart en-
snared,
0 let npt now that yielding passion cease,
But care tor ever if ever thou hast cared ;
Tor love has powerful grace, that changes even
A theft so vile into a gift from heaven.
J XII.
Dear, when I have thee, all the past is here,
And all of time unborn is with me too ;
In thy kiss now all future ones are clear,
And all past others do themselves renew;
And when I say, “I love thee,” then in truth
All earlier and all later vows are there ;
So hath my living love perpetual youth,
Yet is immortal by foreknowledge rare:
Think then how much 1 lose, thou hence being fled .
For if I have thee not, all times are dead.
XIII.
Doth cold forgfetfulriess control thy breast
And make thee so untender as thou art ?
And canst thou live and move, this icy guest
With frozen fingers clutching at thy heart ?
Nay, I dare think thou lov’st me even now,
Though we are long asunder and estranged,
For if love's self be deathless, how couldst thou
Whose spirit was his own breathing, so be changed ?
O till thy face I kiss again to red,
I ’ll swear all Venus’ doves are cold and dead.
XIV.
If gold were silver, and the glittering fire
Of the sun’s self as pallid as the moon.
Or all the moaning organ’s great desire
No better than a tinkling spinet’s tune,, v
If little lakes were open as the sea,
The blade of grass as glorious as the flower,
Then might I be consoled for loss of thee
By following other women for an hour;
But one so happy love hath me possessed,
There is no savour now in all the rest.
xv.
If thou be true, I’ll say that only truth
Is worth enshrining in a lover’s heart ;
If thou be false, I’ll swear that roving youth
And placid constancy are things apart :
And if thy fondness feeds on memories sad,
I’ll bid all ghostly loves by men be cherished,
But if thou ’rt light of heart, I’ll call them mad
Who would choke their lives with dust of follies
perished ;.
And whether thy love liveth or is dead,
Thy dear perfection shall not be missaid.
XVI.
All record of our love is from me thrown,
And I am sworn to cherish naught of thee :
Yet that rash vow was to myself alone,
And every day is broken stealthily.
For in the starlight have I hid thine eyes,
No breeze forgets the name I trusted to it;
O’er blossoming grass an airy tremor flies,
And well £ know whose dancing feet go through it:
I have given thee up to heav’n and earth, and they
Daily my gift back to myself convey.
• XVII.
It is not true that our great joy is dead ;
My dreams forbid me think I am alone.
To-night L lay by thee re-visited,
And thy dear face was hung above my own.
O night, come often for such visions’ sake !
Say not that in that hour I slept, but rather
That only then I truly was awake
When all my heart rushed to my lips, to gather
Such fruits as, slumbering, young Endymion
gleaned
When o’er his face the melting goddess leaned,
xviii.
Twin fountains of gray twilight are thine eyes
Wherein my soul makes haste her brow to lave,
Being taught by thee that there kind solace lies,
Drowning all sorrow in its quiet wave.
For from their depth shines out no pallid gleam ,
Of wild desire made sick with tumult sore,
But light of that Elysium of man’s dream
Where the wearied spirit sleeps for evermore,
In groves that bloom when pain and passion cease
To break on their cool rest and murmuring peace.
xix.
Let men look back a minute on their way
Of life, and all its paths they have unrolled,
Where much has tired their feet with ashes gray,
But much is paved with solid gleaming gold ;
The stubborn cinders bruised them, stumbling slow,
And all the easier road seemed poor and null,
Yet gazing on the backward prospect—lo,
What dazzling lines triumphant o’er the dull !
Even such a shining road is that, whereon.
Our lingering feet a year or two have gone.
xx.
Yet am I grown too sick of heart to write
To handle sorrow with a halting pen
That was not swift enough for my delight:
Eor in my life will never come again
Thy face and tby sweet promise ; and although
Little there was of what’s so little left,
Yet doth my heart beat dolorous and slow.
Of even such shadowy images bereft:
Fm when it was not sick, but swayed could be,
Its tide of blood was only ruled by thee.
XXI.
I think some spell has sealed my spirit’s wings—
Yea, and hath blinded it and made it dumb,
So that it lies, brooding on vanished things
Or what sits darkly in the time to come :
Veiled are all things and hidden from my ken,
To-morrow is no clearer than to-day ;
I move as in a dream ’mid other men,
And yet I live not, since thou art away :
O what a murderess now is fortune shown,
To leave me lifeless here so long alone !
XXII.
Not in the future of unhopeful things
Do I discern much cause to make me glad,
Eor men see never what the morning brings
Only that every evening leaves them sad :
Not in the present will my heart run mad,
Since so far distant is thy face again,
But ever is it murmuring. “I had,’’
Meeting “I have not” with that dull refrain ;
For when all words are spoken, at the last
Even our cruel ‘ - shall not ” will be past.
XXIII.
Now in my heart I see the long night fall,
Too soon swept downward from the folds of time :
Hear lonely voices ever unanswered call
Sad tender words, dim sobbing sound of rhyme:
Through the wide midnight where its veil is thrown
Pale ghosts of happy seasons wander weeping,
And in their midst love lieth, carved in stone,
Till hope no more dares think he is but sleeping;
Alas, not hope’s far eyes or urgent breath
Can pierce, can cleave that air of night and death.

LIKE HISTORY IT REPEATS ITSELF
As a means of pleasure and sport, the Winchester Automatic
Rifle is as far ahead of any other .22 Caliber as an automobile
is ahead of the historic one-horse shay. After loading this
rifle, all that it is necessary to do to shoot it ten times is to
pull the trigger for each shot. Although automatic in action,
it is simple in construction and not apt to get out of order.
For city, country or camp it is the gun of the day.

GENERAL DEBILITY
COMPLETE PROSTRATION.
SOMETHING LIKE A CURE.
The Case of Mrs. E. LAWES.
a Sydney Reporter.)
As the following- case achieved un-
usual notoriety it is proper that the
main facts should bo put before the
public in complete form. We are in-
debted to Mrs. Fmily Lawes, of Mo.
21 Redferu-slreet, Kodfern, for the nar-
rative, which was begun in answer to
this statement by a reporter :
“I have been informed that about
thirteen years ago you caused general
surprise by shaking off a serious ill-
ness. Will you kindly give me the par-
ticulars
“With pleasure,” acquiesced Mrs.
Lawes. ‘Wes; it's all thirteen years
since my illness, for it was after my
first child was born that I sank into
such a pitiful state of weakness that
for six weary weeks I could not put
mv foot to the ground. The nurse who
attended me told mother she thought
1 was going into a decline, and you
S'hofuld have seen me then. You would
have thought so, too. Talk about
feebleness ! It was awful. 1 had a lit-
tle dog that came into my room one
night and jumped on the bed, and
would you believe that 1 didn t have
enough strength to push him off ?”
“At the end of six weeks were you
any better ?”
“If 1 was it was very slightly, I can
tell you, for I was just barely able to
stand, and that was all. The nurse
used to say : ‘For goodness sake don’t
go to the door because you look so
wretched.’ and, my word, 1 felt
wretched. When 1 persisted in trying
to crawl for a few yards about the
house, it was impossible for me to
straighten mysFf rp, and there 1 was
—bent double like an old woman. But
it wasn’t every day that I could got
up, and 1 remember on one occasion a
relative coming into my bedroom,
and, after looking at me, rushing out.
saying ; ‘Come in, Fin’s dead !’ so
that will give you an idea of the
deathly appearance I bore. The truth
was, i afterwards learned, that she
could not notice me breathing, my re-
spiration was so feeble, and that, com-
bined with the fact that I was not ex-
pected to recover, gave her the idea
at once that I was dead. I was very
near it though, and I’m sure I never
thought for a moment that I would
ever recover. But there is a Divine
Providence watching over all of us,
and He did not desert me in my hour
of need. I had got so fearfully thin
that it must have been painful to look
at me."
“Have you any idea what weight
you were then ?”
“1 was greatly reduced, and as
ghastly a mortal as you could find in
a day’s march. Well, I was going to
tell you about the blessings that were
afterwards showered upon me. By some
means or other, when death was un-
doubtedly staring me in the face, I
got into touch with Clements Tonic, a
remedy that L had heard a good deal
about, and do you know that the dif-
ference which that medicine made in
me was something extraordinary V Up
till then I had the greatest difficulty
in the world in making myself eat.
Let the food be as nicely prepared,
and as light as it could possibly be, it
was all the same —one or two mouth-
fuls, and 1 was done. But not so with
the pain. It was then that it started.
Mv chest felt chocked up with some-
thing, and I was oppressed- almost to
suffocation. Hot flushes used to come
and go. the blood rushing to my head,
and making me feel quite giddy, while
the pains in my head nearly distract-
ed me. Now, this is what I liked
about Clements Tonic. It was abso-
lutely the only medicine to do me good
in regard to those symptoms.”
“How many others had you given a
trial to ?”
“A great number. I took all sorts
of phvsics, and not one them ap-
pealed to my case at all. They were
absolutely worthless, lint Clements
Tonic acted like a charm. I could leal
it instilling' fresh vigour into me as
distinctly as one feels the warm glow
of a weicome lire on a winter s night,
and shortly after commencing with it
1 began to feel hungry. This was sure-
ly something surprising. But what
will you think when I tell you that
Clements Tonic so acted upon niv in-
ternal organs that my food started to
digest again ? Why, there are people
who saw me at the time, who heard
me say how much Clements Tonic had
done, "and yet could scarcely believe
their eyes or ears. But it was an in
disputable fact that I was on the
mend, and to my dying day I shall
thank Clements Tonic for it. I used
to sleep very indillercntly, and awoke
feeling non. 1 the fresher f >r the r, st I had
got—in tact, 1 was always so weary
and melancholy, and had such an in-
tense aching feeling right through my
body that 1 often felt that I would
like to lie down and die. I don’t look
as if 1 am much troubled with such
gruesome thoughts now, though, do 1?"
‘‘Mo ; you certainly look the pi ture
of health, Mis. Lawes.”
"That’s what everybody tells me,
which shows what can happen in even
the most hopeless cases so long as a
few bottles of Clements Tonic can be
got. Goodness me, I am now over
twelve stone weight, and have had six
children since Clements Tonic snatched
me from the grave thirteen years ago,
and I can honestly tell you that from
then till now I have not had one day’s
illness. That will show you whether
my cure was a complete one or not.
But I don’t think I’ve told you half!
went through yet. J didn’t refer to the
tunes that 1 had giddy seizures—well,
they were very numerous occasions
indeed ; and I didn’t say anything
about the horrible feeling of fulness in
I the stomach which used to come on
when T had been given some refresh-
ment. This was before using- Clements
Tonic,' you know. Afterwards, I was
not like the same woman, for I could
eat anything, and not experience the
least inconvenience, every particle of
pain arising from indigestion having-
disappeared. There is another .thing 1
would like to mention in order to
point out what a s-dendid all-round
remedy Clements Tonic is. It is that
during my illness mv heart was great-
lv at'ected with palpitation, and. un-
der the influence of Clements Tonic
lhat trouble left me. Again, I was one
of the most, nervous of women, and if
I happened to be left in the house
alone I felt so timid that I dared not
move, while to be without a light was
always enough to make me fret terri-
bly. You've no idea the excessive mis-
ery my nervousness brought me, and
as I’ve been free from it all these
1 years it’s time similar sufferers had the
benefit of my experience.”
‘‘So I’ll print it ?”
•|< ‘‘Certainly : in any way you please
you -may publish it.”

A little vanity is a good tiling.
Every woman should try, at all times,
to look her very best. But it certainly
must be discouraging to have your
mirror tell you that your hair is gray
when you are only thirty or fifty!
Gray hair adds twenty years to the
age. Why not look as young as you
are, or even younger ?
Ayer's Hair Vigor
Always restores color to gray hair,
always. Brings back all the deep,
rich, beautiful color of early youth.
Perhaps the color of your hair suits,
but you are losing the hair itself. You
are threatened with thin hail’, rough
hair, scraggly hair. Your hair seems
weak, not well nourished. Then givo
it Ayer’s Hair Vigor, a true hair-
food. It stops falling hair, makes
the hair grow, and keeps it soft and
silky.

Various Verses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sheep’s Sermon.
Dearly beloved Shepherds, O hear me preach to-
day,
Oh, hear my humble pleading, turn not your
hearts away;
I know you heed the bleating of a straying ewe or
lamb,
Then hear this exhortation by a wether or a ram.
I’ve searched the sacred Scriptures; I have
searched them day and night;
And I found this law eternal— High Heaven must
he white.
White and snowlike are the Angels around a great
white throne,
And the Victor’s name is written plainly on a
great white stone.
Tho’ the wicked shall be wicked, yet the wise
shall understand,
Many shall be white and spotless, standing on the
Lord’s right hand.
At the great Transfiguration—holy and sublime
the sight—
There our gracious King and Teacher was arrayed
in glistening white.
Let Australia be like Zion—keep it white beneath
the sun,
Like the heart of the great Mystic (look up
Revelation one),
Like the raiment of the godly (Revelation three
and four),
Like the prophet’s sea of crystal, like the pallid
horse that bore
The rider of the judgment; like the garment of
the bride
When the myriad Saints encompassed, dressed in
white on every side.
Solomon, the ancient Preacher, still can teach you
to be wise.
Says “ The poor man is forgotten and his wisdom
we despise; ”
Wise man’s words are heard in quiet more than
words of him who rules
Like an ass within a palace braying to a race of
fools.
Now the Preacher loved fair women, and I say
his taste was right,
For the chief among ten thousand, he declared is
ruddy white.
Do you ask me where the black sheep, whe re the
outcast ones will go—
Will they be debarred from Heaven ? O beloved !
surely No !
When the mighty muster’s over, with the white
sheep they will feed,
But they will defile no longer the Almighty’s
chosen breed,
They’ll be washed in some solution, kept in sun-
shine warm and bright,
And before they enter Heaven, they’ll be bleached
a snowy white.

The Land.
“ The meek shall possess the land ” —
Where acre by acre is barred
By rocks on every hand,
Wind-wasted and lightning-scarred.
“The meek shall possess the land ” —
Where the heaped-up dunes stretch wide,
On the edge of a long sea strand
On the marge of a brackish tide.
“ The meek shall possess the land ” —
If it win no usurer’s eye,
If the stealing and boodling band
Of agents have passed it by.
But where it is fair and green
The fierce shall inherit the land.
What the Scripture meant, I ween,
Was : *' The meek shall possess the sand

The Alternative.
When you stride abroad on the yielding sward,
Or the pavement, hard and dry,
With the end in view of a purpose new
As the anxious moments fly,
Your mind is caught by a vagrant thought,
And your soul awhile will fret
If it strives to slip from the tyrant grip
Of the woman you can’t forget.
At the crowded place where the horse 3 race,
And the raucous Ikey sings,
When the greed of gain distracts your brain
From the sense of higher things,
In the sudden light of a second sight
Comes a vision of dear Nanette,
And there’s naught of worth on this sinful earth,
Save the woman you can’t forget.
Other girls seemed fair, but you ceased to care
For the kisses they freely gave;
Other girls were kind, but your love declined,
Or it passed like a tidal wave.
Yes, your pulse beat slow as you let them go
With a feeling of calm regrtt—
And now, after all, you are held in thrall
By the woman you can’t forget.
It i 3 heart for heait, and your ways may part,
But never your love can die.
It is good or bad, it is sane or mad
(Very probably mad, say 1) ;
The spell is cast, and the spell will last
From the moment when first you met
Till you quit this life, or have made your wife
The woman you can’t forget.

HOW I GREW TALL
A Startling: Story which will Interest
all who are short.
The Height of Either Sex can
quickly be increased from
Two to Five Inches.
These Marvellous Results can be accom-
plished at home without the knowledge
Of your most Intimate friends.
The Free Book tells you all about It.
&A
'//,
A
Inventors, scientists, and physicians have for
years been trying to find some method whereby
the height of an individual could be increased,
and up to the last few years have met with failure.
It remained for a comparatively young man, Mr.
K. Leo Minges by name, to discover what so many
others had failed to do.
Mr. Minges resides in Brighton, N.Y., and has
devoted the best part of his life to studying and
experimenting on the Cartilage, and his great
efforts have at last been crowned with success. A
large company, composed of Brighton’s leading
citizens, has been formed for the purpose of
placing Mr. Minges’ discovery and inventions
before the public, so that now it is possible for
any lady or gentleman who is short to increase her
or his height from two to five inches. These
results are absolutely guaranteed.
Mr. Minges has successfully used his method on
himself, and has grown from a short, stunted
boy to a handsome, robust man of six feet one
inch in height. Thousands of people living in all
parts of the world are using his method with
equally as startling results. Let us send you the
absolute proof of the above statements. We have
just issued a beautifully illustrated book, entitled
“ How to Grow Tall, ” which contains information
that will surprise you. Ten thousand of these
remarkable books will be given away absolutely
free of charge in order to introduce them. If you
fail to receive a copy, you will always regret it.
This great book tells how Mr. Minges made his
wonderful discovery. It tells you how you can
increase your height and build up the entire sys-
tem. It contains the pictures and statements of
many who have used this method. After you
receive the book you will thank us the longest day
you live for having placed within your reach this
great opportunity.
Remember, a postal card will, bring it to your
very door, all charges prepaid. All correspond-
ence strictly confidential and sent in plain
envelopes. If you wish a free copy of this book
and the proof of our claims, write to-day. Ad-

WHAT IS CATARRH?
fsd
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
tlie lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
the sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try

The Secret of the
Anchor Fenoe —
NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST
CAN BREAK IT DOWN. -
GENERAL FARM FENCE.
The Anchor Fence will admit of the posts being set further apart than in any other fence construction. The
Anchor fence saves 3-sths of the number of posts usually required—hence less digging. Only one special tool is
required in the construction of the Anchor Fence—the Anchor Clamp Pincher which secures the clamp and crimps
both wires making a perfectly rigid joint.
The Anchor Fence is
A PERFECT FENCE.

Messrs. E. Rich & Co., Ltd., O’Connell-street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ult., and thank you for the information
contained therein.
My Anchor Fence was the means of Messrs. Stitt Bros., of Boyd, using it, also Mr. Coward, of Carrawobity, and I
have just supplied particulars and specifications to Messrs. Edols, of Burrawong, who, I believe, are renewing their
boundary fence, and were much taken with my style of fence. lam myself satisfied that at present it is the best system
of fencing, both for economy and utility.
Will you please send me as early as possible :—3OOO Galv. Anchor Clamps; 600 Galv. Anchor Standards 38" •
lcwt. Tie Wire.
Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) WALLACE HUNTER.
If a targe tree should fall across an ANCHOR FENCE the wires will not be damaged. Remove the tree, take a few turns with
the Ratchet Strainer, and the fence will be as good as new. There is no sagging by expansion or breaking by contraction
with ANCHOR FENCE. ANCHOR FENCE cannot injure stock, nor can stock injure ANCHOR FENCE,

THE CHEAP LABOR LAND.
A man, recently returned from a visit to India
writes this :
India is, pre-eminently, the land of cheap labor, and
the labor is cheap partly because it is fearsomely and
wonderfully inefficient. It is also conservative and anti-
quated beyond belief. The sweeper, whether he is clean-
ing the street or the house-floor, still stoops over the
bundle of frayed twigs two feet long with which he feebly
professed to swish the dust off the Mogul empire in the
days of Auriinozbbe ; and 100 of him produce less im-
pression than one up-to-date street-cleaning apparatus.
The ‘ bheestie,” or water-carrier, carries water for the
bath, or tries to lay the dust of the roadway with two
gallons of fluid humped along by personal exertion in a
goat-skm bag, and sits down to rest in the shade when
his boss is not looking. There can still be seen all over
India the spectacle described in Scripture of two women
grinding at a mill, and when they have ground
all day for twopence each, they produce less profit
for their employer than the highly-paid mill employee
of America or Australia does for his employer in
a couple of hours, though they certainly save a great
deal in machinery. The employee in the Indian jute fac-
tory is cheap, but it requires ten of him to do the work of
one white operative in the jute mills of Dundee. The
Indian domestic is cheap, but it requires ten of him to
attend to a family of, say, a man and his wife and infant
and to care for a cottage and garden and the humble
every day Indian pony. For the sweeper will only sweep
and the water-carrier will only carry water, and the pony
fiend will only look after the pony, and the cook will only
cook (even then he demands an assistant) ; and the dish-
washer and crockery-dropper are each separate institutions
from all the others, and the bill for the whole ten thieves
runs to an average of £lO per month. The Indian dyer
works for 4d. or so per day ; he dyes one bit of cloth at a
time in a wash basin, and then he and another dyer
stand in the middle of the street holding out the
solitary sample to dry. When all allowances are
made, the Indian is cheaper than the white man
but not nearly so much cheaper as might appear
on the surface of things. And behind his cheap-
ness lies this consideration : Assuming that Australia
barren as it is, could support 50,000,000 white men it
might—though this is by no means certain support
100,000,000 of a colored population of the Indian type
This is giving the Indian the benefit of a very large doubt'
for his own rich country does not support like
so thick a population as do far less fertile areas in Europe
—his inefficiency causes him to be poor under conditions
which make the white man rich. But taking the very im-
probable assumption that Australia would carry twice as
large a brown population as it would a white one, it would
be a vastly poorer country—a land with not one-fifth of
the wealth, or one-hundredth part of the prospects. The
curse of inefficiency would be upon it, and it would be a
lost community which had sold its future for a mess of
pottage, and, instead of getting the equivalent it bar-
gained for, had lost what pottage it previously possessed.
« * • *
If cheap labor were the road to general affluence that the
Tories describe it, India should be one of the richest
countries on this earth. It has a very productive
soil. It has practically every kind of mineral on earth.
It has a magnificent river system, and it is splendidly
defended by its great mountain barriers against outside
enemies. Yet what is the result ? Barren, thriftless and
almost waterless Australia has, in the mere 120 years
which make up its history, gathered together private
wealth (after deducting the proportion which belongs to
absentees) equal to about £2OO per inhabitant. The rich
laud of India, with the alleged inestimable blessing and
advantage of cheap labor to help it along, has been
accumulating wealth for at least 3000 years and
according to the latest available calculations it has
got as far as £lO (ten pounds) for each inhabitant.
Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Holland, and
Belgium are all countries which carry a far larger
population on each square mile than India does,
and carry it on a less fertile soil, yet the poorest of
them, with its comparatively expensive white labor, has
11 times as much wealth per head as the cheap labor land
of Hindustan. And while cheap black labor certainly
doesn t make the cheap black laborer rich, it doesn’t seem
either to do anything very special for the cheap man’s
white employer. In India just now the jute industry is
on the top of a boom, and does prettv well —that is to say
dividends range from 17 per cent, down to nil. The tea
industry is very low down. The indigo industry is prac-
tically a corpse. Other trades are plodding along in a
respectable way, but doing nothing in particular—out of
13 cotton null companies quoted in Calcutta 10 paid no
dividend in 1904. The white merchants of Calcutta and
Bombay show less signs of affluence than those of
Sydney and Melbourne. The European banks in this
community of nearly 300,000,000 people number
14 all told (the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank is not an
Indian concern), with capital ranging from £1,266,666 in
one case, and £BOO,OOO in another, down to £13,500, and
their dividends vary from 12 per cent, in the best
case down to 2 per cent, in the case of the
institution that has lost all its reserves, and nil
in the case of the one that has lost almost all its
capital as well. The commerce of India is, in pro-
portion to population, only one-sixth that of Australia.
Everywhere there stands out conspicuously the ineffici-
ency of a shambling, uncertain, incapable race—a race of
undesirables and losers of opportunities.
The Indian is cheap for other reasons besides his ineffici-
ency as a worker. To some extent wages adjust them-
selves to the wants of the worker, and a race which
‘J?® 8 " t a decent water-supply, which has always
dispensed with drains, which never heard such a word as
furniture, which can get along with a mere scrap of
education, not much clothing, a hovel worth about £2
(and which can put the maximum of people into the
minimum of hovel) has other things besides its ineffici-
®J lcy fc< ? “ ak ® u cheap. But while these things make it
cheap they also make it undesirable, plague-stricken, and
a moral, mental, and physical infection, and make the
towns it builds an eyesore and a public danger. The
Hindu can certainly, despite the fact that it takes many
of him to do the work of one white man, turn out an
aggregate quantity of work at less cost than the white
“fuW he does t s ls solely by being a plague centre, a
public danger, and an unwholesome blot on the land-
scape The British resident knows his Hindu, and where-
ever it is possible to do so, as at Delhi, Lucknow, Lahore.
lares 7 A ” ra and other centres, he builds his residential
quarter two mdes from the undesirable native city, and
shuns the latter as he would a pestilence. He also shuns
the native, and at times frankly expresses the opinion
that there is not a native policeman, civil ser-
magistrate, judge, lawyer, or private person who
figure b< TT bou £ ht >. and that at a very moderate
n v He e ;' en looks askance at the white man
who has been brought up in India and educated in an
Ind'an atmosphere, and though that white man may have
attained a higher standard of education than is required
to qualify him for admission to the highest grades of the
Indian civil service, the road is barred to him. A certain
amount of Enghsh education is essential, and the entrance
to the higher grades of the service is round by England.
1 lamiy and undisguisedly the charge is.set forth that the
white man, born and educated in India, is liable to have
learned lying, corruption, fraud, and inefficiency in his
ingly" surroundln £ s > and British officialdom acts accord-
A*• * * *
As a side issue, this anomalous land of India suffers
* r °m a Sequent scarcity of labor. The Hindu religion
piedominates, and the Hindu is hidebound by caste.
hke 40iw anno® “5 fou f , castes ; , in Practice there are more
! C ™°[ 40 f of -. Roughly speaking, the position may be
set forth by taking a large sheet of paper and dividing it
f P c A number of perpendicular lines
the great Hindu sect according to its
Sumhcr of £ gl ° US d f e, ;? nce - An equal, or unequal
of . horizontal lines may further subdivide
these divisions according to difference of occupation.
~ bberal number of diagonal lines drawn from
j- as , to south-west may again subdivide them
according to place of residence, for the people of a
special caste and occupation at Muddypore are not
necessarily on speaking, eating, drinking, or marryinir
terms with those of an apparently identical caste at
Dustypore. Then a further series of diagonal lines
running athwart the first lot may finally subdivide
according to tribal descent, for in many cases tribe and
caste are almost undistinguishable. The resulting divi-
sions represent the social and political life of India—
-tunau India. All this produces amazing' results. The
a £ ert^ n ° asfce ought to be warriors only, and
should rush to battle (so far as such people do rush) with
a sword and a crate of antiquated armor. Not being-
allowed under British rule to rush in this fashion, they
do a certain amount of agriculture under compulsion,
and wait for better times. There are sub-castes of
executioners and of persons who provide amusement by
means of animals (this crowd is divided into the sub-
caste which leads round bears, the one with the
performing monkey, and the one with the tame
snakes, and they are again divided into plain
bear and bear with music, also plain monkev
and monkey with music, and so on, and it is quite
possible that it may be lawful for the man who takes
round the performing snake to marry the daughter of the
man who takes round the monkey with music, while he
would be accursed if he married the sister of the man who
takes round the bear without music). There is the
washerman caste (no Hindu will even do his own washing
S r Wlfe ?° Unless they belon & to th e washtr
caste), the ten or twelve castes of household servants, the
castes which make music at burials or predict the future
of new-born infants, the tribes or castes which dig- wild
animals out of holes, and others past counting. And
while millions of Hindus are sitting down waiting for
something to turn up in their own line of business—
perhaps a line which the march of progress made almost
superfluous a century ago—the new modern industries are
struggling hard to find workers. For unfortunately there
is no jute factory caste and no caste of railway stokers.
And unless caste can be struck with some heavy
object and knocked endways, there are fears that India
may yet be a country where the man who fools along in
the old rut can be got for 4d. a day, while the one
who is willing to work in a new modern industry will ask
a prohibitive wage as compared with his value. Already
he has taken to strikes with a good deal of enthusiasm.
* * * *
The Hindu yearns probably more than any other man
°“ tbl * eai v htobe a trad er. It is hard to believe that
there can be any other country where the spectacle is so
common of four able-bodied men carefully keeping ten
cubm yards of shop, the stock of which is worth, perhaps”
£5 all told, and proudly making two shillings profit to be
divided among the firm at the close of the day. It is for
this reason that the country which imports the Indian
cheap laborer finds him, to its rage and disgust, presently
give up cheap laboring and rush into the lazy, over-
crowded shop-keeping or hawking industry. The Hindu
also . tc ? be a Priest. Tawdry, dirty temples about
the size of a two-roomed cottage are innumerable, and in
them may be found the old style of disciple in dingy,
flowing robes, and the new half-Europeanised style in an
old greenish frock-coat, dirty, frayed trousers, dirty bare
feet, and a hard hat which looks as if it had been run
for 40 days and 40 nights. Likewise
the Hindu yearns even more than the Australian to be a
civil servant, and as a policeman he robs publicly on the
bl^ h ''' ay a P d sel . ls justice in the open day. He lacks all
the essentials of a good citizen. In most cases he lacks
even the common attribute of courage. He has little love
of country for he never really had a country—only a dis-
jointed multitude of towns and villages. He has no
national spirit. When the Roman empire collapsed
b . natlons as the English, French, Germans, ’ and
nmv he d the n u°f ld e ted f oUt ° f the ruins > and ’ whatever
may be the defects of even the worst of them, their
national instinct is so strong that it would be indeed a
if ° f who d ’l® am ? d °f permanently s übduing
any one of them. India in 2000 years of history
never evffived one permanent State-one State which
bad P?™anent boundaries, a national spirit, and
an existence that was more durable than the
dynasty which ran the show. The stupendous
mountain barrier which even a third-rate Euro-
pean State could have held against all-comers the
Hmdu never held against anybody. He has never mani-
fested the slightest sign of a self-governing capacity.
His inventive power—save in the invention of false evi-
dence seems almost nil nowadays. His “loyalty” is
more than dubious ; the native papers teem with frantic
abuse of the British rule, and in the early days of the
Boer war, when one defeat followed another, even the
Indian Government notes were unanimously refused in
some parts of India, the native being wholly unwilling
to chance the loss of five rupees (6s. Bd.) for the sake of
what he regarded as the falling Empire.
* * * •
The Hindu knocks at the door of Australia in the
capacity of our fellow-subject, which is the strongest
reason why he should be kept out. He would not be our
fellow-subject if he were not mostly a coward and wholly
an incapable ; no race worth having could have been con-
quered by the mere handful of soldiers who overran India.
He comes as an inefficient workman ; a man who has made
and stagnation a fine art; a man who has spent
6000 years or more in evolving beggary in one of the richest
*? n earth I the man who has even forgotten the art
of hiring Italian artificers to build such monuments as the
iaj Mahal and passing them off as Indian art. Australia
can assimilate the American, Frenchman, German, Scan-
dinavian and Spaniard ; they bring courage, fighting capa-
city inventiveness and the self-governing instinct to add
to tlie common stock. It doesn’t want to assimilate
the Hindu, who brings none of these. And above
all, in this sordid age, it wants men who know
how to build up a nation worth £2OO per inhabi-
tant—not the £lO variety of immigrant. The nation
cannot afford to give to such people the space it will
want for its own children later on, any more than the
dairy-farmer can afford to give up his best pasture to the
most unproductive and driest kind of cow. The people
who talk of the British race would keep the Hindu out •
the votes of those who babble about the British flag are
for letting him in. But it is the race which made all'that
the English-speaking peoples are, and which made or
s f?*f all that they have. As for the often-altered, often-
shifted flag, it is two yards of calico, and if it were not
for the race that stands behind it there is no nation so
poor that couldn’t wipe its ear thereon. If everybody
who comes under the British flag is allowed for that reason
to adulterate the British race neither race nor flag is
likely to last long. b
SELF-RESPECTING SELF-DEFENCE.
!he Australian Cabinet is still considering the
subject of national defence, and, from all indica-
cations, does not find it easy to come to an agree-
ment as to what can be proposed that will be at
once practical and efficacious. It is not that there
are any special difficulties in the way of Australian
defence. The Australian citizen has, in spite of
his poisonous, foreign-spirited daily press, a sense
of national responsibility—dormant, perhaps, but
still plainly existent. His intelligence is at
least of an average quality. His spirit is, perhaps,
unusually bold and resolved (his pioneering work
in exploring, mining, and land-subduing argues
that). His national wealth, in spite of the burden of
public debt, is far above the average. His manufac-
turing skill is displayed conspicuously abroad, and,
to a slight extent, in his own country, where the
bulk of the press looks upon a manufacturer as a
malefactor, and a section of the Labor party can
only tolerate an employer if he is a foreigner. In
short, the Australian has courage, grit, skill and
money. Those are the raw materials out of which
organization can make an army and a navy.
* * ♦ »
But where the Dkakin Cabinet (which can be
credited with a genuine wish to do something to
take away from Australia the reproach of national
helplessness) meets with an abnormal difficulty is
in the fact that the Australian public has been for
generations taught to believe in its own want of
spirit and capacity. The deplorable lack of an
efficient savage removed from the early Australian
the necessity of learning the discipline of defence.
He came to a country where there was neither
wild man nor wild beast to make him carry a rifle.
So soon as he began to settle down to organised
life, the borrowing habit and the Foreign-trade
habit taught him sloth and dependence. He was
urged to rely on others to do for him what he
should do for himself, and conditions of life
made the bad advice easy of acceptance.
In Australia in the early days (and, to an extent,
still) money was made with a fatal facility, and
this helped the growth of a lazy and disreputable
system of depending on outsiders for the means to
build our public works, for the factories to make
our clothes and our tools, and for the ships to
•defend our shores. The Australian type did not
exactly lose its strenuousness. The stock was too
good for that. But its energies, lacking the call
to devotion to national aims, were perverted into
the larrilcinism of the cities and the bushranging
and the wild devil-may-care nomadism of the
bush ; or were dissipated abroad pioneering in
South America, Africa and Asia. Thus the chief
problem of defence is to waken the dormant self-
respect of Australia and to combat the sloth and the
diffidence which the borrowing politician and the
Foreign-trade politician have been responsible for.
The Deakin Government will find everything in
Australia necessary for defence—even the spirit
to make the essential sacrifices —if it has the
courage and the wisdom to make a large and
worthy appeal.
* • * *
A defence scheme, to be welcome, must be com-
plete and at the same time in its steps practical.
The task of swinging the nation into line with the
prepared peoples is one of such magnitude as to
take years for completion. But a definite, com-
prehensive scheme should be set down at once as
the ultimate goal; the steps towards it should be
clearly indicated, and the first stages should be
taken now and should be big ones. Factories are
wanted for the manufacture, not only of ammuni-
tion of all sorts, but of rifles, field-guns and bayonets,
fehipyards are wanted where torpedo boats (and,
later, battleships and cruisers) can be laid down’
The coast shipping of Australia has to be pro-
tected as a nursery for naval men, and the mail
and produce steamers from Australia to the old
world so regulated by the Commonwealth as to
provide cruisers in time of war. Warships have to
be bought for present needs if they cannot as yet
be built. The youth and manhood of the country
have to be trained, at school and after leaving
school, to provide a fighting force which, in case of
need, could include every able-bodied man in the
community. Strategic railwavs have to be built
to connect the outlying ports of Fremantle and
Port Darwin with the big centres of population,
lhe fort defences have to be overhauled and pro-
vided with modern and effective equipment. All
this work is of pressing urgency, yet cannot be
undertaken at once. Delay is part of the penalty
of past neglect. But there should be a recognition
that all the steps outlined are necessary, and a
resolve to move towards the realisation of all with
quick steps. The industrial means to defence
should engage first attention. Given arms and
ammunition factories, it would be possible after
the outbreak of war to quickly drill and train raw
recruits, so that they would be of some use. With-
out the means to make arms there would be no
possibility of an army.
• * • *
What would be disastrous would be any finicky
proposal, any suggestion to spend a little more
money to put a little patch on inefficiency. A
courageous scheme the people will rise to ; if it
promises a real defence it will be forgiven for ask-
ing real sacrifices. But a tinkering with the
matter will make many enemies, but attract no
friends. The time is opportune for reform. The
march of world events lias shown within a decade
how in S’Africa a small, well-trained nation can
stagger the most powerful of empires, and in Asia
how a poor and hitherto almost barbarous people
can bring itself to the front rank as a naval and
military power. Side by side with these lessons,
contemporary history has impressed powerfully
the insecurity of this lonely outpost of the white
man, standing sentinel before the seething millions
of Asia. No occasion could be better for a bold
appeal to the people. What the Boers and the
Japanese have done prompts to emulation. What
the Yellow Peril threatens gives the added
stimulus of fear.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Military System.
This is an expert view :
Unquestionably General Hutton was an able soldier and
organiser, who, despite his frills and despite certain aims
with which one cannot agree, did his utmost for Australia
according- to his lights, worked himself and his staff not
less than 12 hours a day, and succeeded in achieving a
fair amount of success in the unification of the various
military systems of the States. Lack of funds tied his
hands to a great extent, and political wire-pulling cast
obstacles in his way, but, to give him his due, he left us
with a fairly well-organised defence force of 21,000 men,
having sufficient officers to manage the force when the
ranks were filled with rifle-club men in time of war. The
addition of these rifle-club men would furnish a total force
of 50,000 possessed of some, even if imperfect, training.
* re l)B' t, h this little army satisfied the requirements
of the Council appointed in England to advise “the
colonies ” on matters of defence, for it assumed that the
neet would retain a general command of the sea,
and that outlying colonies had to fear nothing but small
and temporary raids.
Allowing, for the present, this assumption to be correct,
glance at the closing scene of Hutton’s service in
Australia. For three years he had carried out a very
heavy programme with the aid of eight staff officers (all
of the local forces), a few of them able men, the rest being
what might be expected for the pay that he could give.
This staff, on the whole, earned its pay, and Hutton’s
brains made up for what some of them lacked. None
knew better than he what Australia yet needed, and the
danger of adopting the new British scheme, the patent
cure-all for past deficiencies, an Army Council. His last
words to Australia were, in effect, “Don’t take on an
Army Council till you have seen how it will pan out in
England. Don’t think the little army I have organised is
all you need. An invasion of Australia by a great army is
possible. Before you can train a large enough Australian
army you must get the means to train it. I advise you
therefore, as a parting word, to provide magazines for
housing the necessary reserves of anus, ammunition, and
equipment, to get an ammunition factory, a rifle factory,
and a shell factory. ”
.The Australian Government has done the reverse of
this, led either by dense stupidity or worse. We have a
Military Board more-or-less an imitation of the Army
Council, and composed of the aforementioned staff,
neither better not worse than before, but now lacking
Hutton’s brains. And we have not the factories, nor
anyhope of getting them. The “ savings ”on the annual
military vote are to be devoted to providing military
stores, and if we succeed in leaving each year undone a
good portion of the programme approved by Parliament
we may succeed in 100 years in completing that stores
equipment.
The Military Board certainly should be formed of the
best men we can get—-at least one or two of them clear-
headed men of business. Is Australia satisfied to have
her military future ruled by an ill-matched team, which
was capable of some good work under the guidance and
whip of Hutton, but is hardly fit to pull the coach when
the driver is a civilian member of the Government and
unacquainted with the road.
The best man now in Australia, General Finn, has been
practically shelved by being appointed Inspector-General
~ It ,! s tr , ue - but is no secret that the sol
called Military Board has no love for his reports, and that
with a few insignificant exceptions, these reports have
been practically suppressed. We hear constant complaints
from the leading officers of the citizen forces that now
more than ever is red tape the first quality of a soldier
that musketry returns are of much greater importance

Nash on the Horrors of Comparative Solvency.
Now and then, though—alas ! —very rarely, Aus-
tralia makes some small attempt to he compara-
tively honest. When it does this it receives a
minimum of encouragement from the Tory press.
The attitude of the Tory press is hazy and uncer-
tain on the subject of honesty, but it isgenerallv
something like this J
$ That the country is far too deeply in debt already.
(2) That the attempt made at last N.S.W. elections to

(3) That when the community pays off anv of its debts
it is a case of capital being driven out of the countrv
owing to crude and reckless Socialistic legislation

without driving £1,000,000 of capital out of the countrv
the Loud only knows. ■ y
• ! 4) Th A t wben we ? et further into debt it is a “ valuable
influx of foreign capital to develop the great natural re-
sources of the country."
As a case in point, the six months to June, 1905
comprised a period of most unusual honesty and
solvency in Australia. The Australian Govern-
ment borrowed nothing. Premier Morgan in
Queensland and Premier Bent in Victoria had
both shut down on loans, and these two States
were living honorably on their own incomes, and
feeling better for it. N.S.W. was carrying on the
u j an J ' ag more or less ’ but it; found there was
abundance of money to be borrowed in Sydney,
and didn’t apply to London—in fact, it recently
raised a loan of over £500,000 in Sydney in one
month, and only an insane borrower would go to
the other side of the world for money when it was
being thrown at him like that in his own town.
S.A. and Tasmania were also keeping reasonably
solvent, and only Westralia went advertising its
poverty on a large scale by trying to raise the wind
m Lngland, and to make the biggest debt per head
on earth still larger. And financial editor Nash
of Sydney Telegraph noted these facts, and made
a strange wailing sound like a banshee at a key-
hole m the paper’s financial column (10/8/’O5)

The Cornstalk’s Beer.
N.S.W. has got at least one definite statement
from its shifty Premier —he says he will be no
party to paying money compensation to publicans
who are closed up by a Local Option vote. And
in this respect there is a good deal to be said for
Carruthers’ view of the case, whether he sticks
to that view or not. A hotel license is a permit
to sell drink, under certain conditions, for a year,
and it is not, and never has been, anything more
than that. It is a habit to renew the permit from
year to year supposing the hotel is well-conducted
and has the necessary accommodation, and often
when the hotel is ill-conducted and has practically
no accommodation except for those who conduct
the business ; but the fact that the State has done
that renewal in the past doesn’t bind the State to
anything in the future. It never does any
more than issue the annual permit, and
it can leave off doing so whenever it
feels inclined. The private landlord, however
often he may have renewed the tenant’s annual
lease, holds himself under no obligation to continue
renewing it, and, even if his refusal wrecks the
tenant’s business, he pays no compensation. If it
were not for the tendency to regard the State as
an institution which everybody has a right to
swindle, the idea that it is bound to pay compen-
sation would probably never have arisen. Also,
by way of a side issue, as matters stand a large
number of licenses are obtained and held under
false pretences. A hotel is supposed to be a
place which provides accommodation for the travel-
ling public—something more than a mere drinking
shop; yet there are in Sydney high-class hotels with
only one or two bedrooms over and above those
used by the proprietors and employees, and even
these rooms are never occupied. The appli-
cant who arrives from the tram or steamer,
with his carpet-bag and his brown paper par-
cel, is simply informed that the house is
full. If any really serious attempt were made
to enforce the existing law, a very large reduction
in the number of hotels might be made without
any further legislation. Another side issue of the
case is the curious persistence with which the
Local Option party sticks to the purely local
character of the option. The Bill now before the
N.S.W. Assembly—the one into which Premier
Carruthers says he will not introduce the money
compensation idea even if he dies on the threshold
of the last public-house in defence of his principles—
provides for running the Local Option system on
more effective principles. It embodies the three
old issues : continuation of the existing number of
licences, reduction, or abolition—no one has yet
been logical enough to allow the public to
vote on all the issues, and to put increase of
licences on the ballot paper. But the vote
is still to be taken separately in little districts,
and is only to apply separately to little districts.
A proposal by M ‘Neill, M.L.A., to take a State
vote on continuation, reduction, or abolition for
the whole of N.S.W., and thus to give to the
State a chance to turn dry and virtuous over
320,000 square miles of country in one great act,
hardly got a hearing. Yet, to any man who loves
to do large things and attack large problems, the
idea of 320,000 square miles becoming beer-dry in
one act, and 1,400,000 people finding their liquor
cut off simultaneously, and a Government tearing
round to make up some £900,000 per annum of lost
revenue in one jump, has its attractions. The
Bulletin gives its vote for National Option all
the time.
The Secret Commission Swindle.
There has been a dismal weakening and tapering
off on the part of Victorian Minister Mackey
over the Secret Commissions Bill, and unless some
stronger man interferes, that measure might al-
most as well be dead now. The Employers’
Federation came and breathed in Mackey’s ear,
and he promised to alter the Bill so as only to pro-
hibit secret commissions if received for a corrupt
purpose. The proposition looks well at a distance,
and smells very badly at short range. It is built
on the theory that there may be secret commis-
sions that are kept secret just for the humor of the
thing, and hidden, murky jobs that are kept
hidden solely because they are so pure that they
can stand full inspection. And these assumptions
are very thin. The plain and obvious rule to go
by is that there is no need to keep any commission
secret unless it is corrupt, therefore there
should be no secret commissions at all. In
every trade the agent charges so much for his
services and puts the charge in his accounts.
That is supposed to be the only commission in the
business, and if there is any other which can’t
stand inspection it should be made intensely
illegal. The whole secret commission business is
a system whereby A hires B to make the best
possible bargain for him with 0, and isn’t aware
that Bis also paid by 0. Mackey’s original Bill
laid it down that A must be made aware, so that
he can form his own opinion as to whether C is
Eaying B out of pure philanthropy, or is paying
im for not making the best possible bargain.
Apparently under the proposed alteration it will
only be necessary, should trouble arise, for C and
all his clerks to swear that the secret commission
was paid for pure love of B, and not because of
any benefit or advantage they got out of him at
A’s expense, in his capacity as A’s agent. Agent
B, who is paid openly by one side and secretly
by the other, is in the position of the
lawyer who is paid by the prosecutor, and
doesn’t tell him that he is also paid by
the defence. And it is seriously proposed
by the weak-kneed Mackey that this shall be
allowed unless it can be proved that Bor O, or
both, had a corrupt motive. What other motive
could either of them have ? And yet, how could
the motive be legally proved ? Is it seriously ex-
pected that G will enter his motive in the ledger,
or tell it to his clerks, or make a copy of it in his
letter-book? It is the unspeakable bad luck of
Australia that, almost every time, when it is about
to do something thoroughly and well, a spineless
Minister is “interviewed,” as in the present case,
and consents to leave it less than half-done.
There is a great deal said in Australia about
the desire to give a generous lift to the
“primary producer.” The revelations at the
Butter Inquiry created an impression that the
“primary producer” of the grease that people
eat was being remorselessly swindled by the
middleman —largely through secret commissions.
Yet it is hard to say that it was legally proved in
one single case that the secret commission busi-
ness was corrupt. The payers and the receivers
of these commissions were equally prepared to
attest that the money simply passed as a matter
of habit, and there was no one who could attest
the contrary, though everybody believed the
contrary. Under the new system certainly the
onus of proving that the secret commission was
not given corruptly is to be cast on B, the agent,
but that change doesn’t seem likely to make any
difference. The payer and the receiver will prove
the purity of their action just as before. There
will be on that side of the case the solemn oath of
B, who received the secret commission from O
on the purest and noblest basis, and the un-
reserved awear of C, who paid it to B with no
guile in his heart. And, on the other side, there
will be billy the rage and suspicions of A, pro-
bably an incoherent farmer with red whiskers—
A, the person who is always left in the lurch. On
the present showing it seems as if the Butter
Inquiry was a wasted business. The old hog—
the commission hog—is making amazingly good
time back to his wallow.

Local Government in New South Wales.
In view of last week’s proceedings it seems really
doubtful if Local Government, which every poli-
tical party in N.S.W. has been crying for in theory
all through the past forty years, has one sincere
friend in the present N.S.W. Assembly. Every
party has Local Government on its • programme,
yet amid all this nominal applause and enthusiasm
it is hardly possible to keep a quorum together to
discuss the Shires Bill and the Local Government
Extension Bill. Those who do attend are mostly
cantankerous. In N.S.W. the agricultural para-
site has always been accustomed to having his
local works done for him at the expense of others,
and his produce carried by rail for about one-
fourth or one-sixth of what it costs to carry it,
and the Shires Bill seems carefully devised to
save this protected and subsidised individual from
paying his own way in the Local Government
sense any more than can be avoided. Between
State subsidies, land-tax handed over, and rates
paid out of the Treasury on State lands, there
seems a fair chance that, in some districts, the
cocky won’t need to rate himself at all, and tha,t
the mayor may almost be able to declare a divi-
dend to the inhabitants. But it isn’t quite sure
that he will be able to declare a dividend, or that
the farmer may not have to pay a little for his
own roads and bridges, instead of loafing for them
always on the loan funds and on the city worker ;
so all round the Assembly shocked and anxious
members have been rising to say that they
can’t support the measure unless assured
that it doesn’t mean “more taxation.” The
N.S.W. farmer, as things stand at pre-
sent, pays, in many cases, no taxation
at all. He pays nothing in the way of local rates,
not very much in the way of customs and excise,
and very little in land-tax. What he receives
back from the State as a rebate in the way of
having his produce carried at far lower rates than
anybody else and at far below cost —a rebate which
has to be made up by taxing the town population
and charging specially heavy freights to the town
producer—in many cases returns to him his paltry
tax contribution two or three times over. And
the average country member is of opinion that
unless some form of Local Government can be
devised whereby the person who pays nothing, or
less than nothing, shall pay no more than at
present, Local Government will be wholly unsatis-
factory. Evidently the theory still exists in some
quarters that the Australian is a special kind of
individual who shouldn’t be expected to pay his
way like any other mortal. There are demands
on all sides for still more subsidy ; also demands
that the State shall spend an extra million or so
on putting all local works in the most perfect state
of repair imaginable, so that for the first few years
the Local Government bodies will have nothing to
do except drink the subsidy. There are proposals
about a referendum to find out if anybody really
wants Local Government —this after almost every
member has professed, for 40 years past, to be quite
sure that it is the one thing the country does want
unanimously. And one member was simply stag-
gered at the courage of Premier Carruthers in
telling the Farmers and Settlers Conference
that his Local Government measures might
mean an extra tax of £49,000 a year. Then the
N.S.W. roads and bridges politician sees that
with Local Government his. occupation will be
to a great extent gone, and the pity of it
is that, for want of Local Government, N.S.W.
has very few politicians now of any other kind.
The general opinion among these politicians seems
to be that the only satisfactory kind of Local
Government will be one by which the roads and
culverts arrive naturally, and the bridges grow on
trees, and the large State subsidy is shared out
twice a year among the rate-receivers of the
district. Meanwhile Premier Carruthers doesn’t
make his two Bills party questions, and merely
says that if they don’t pass a “great responsi-
bility ” will rest on those who throw them out.
Which is not so violent a remark as it might be.

The Union Label.
That deputation that waited upon Federal
Attorney-General Isaacs to complain about the
union label clause of the Commonwealth Trade
Marks Bill said it represented interests valued
at £300,000,000. The ensuing debate suggested
that so large a sum of money was represented by
an abnormally small quantity of brains. The
deputationists’ only argument was a reiterated
declaration of the curious statement that they
didn’t want other people’s labels on their goods—
which is a strange yap from people who sell all
manner of bottled- and tinned goods with other
people’s names on them, likewise cutlery, tobacco,
books, boots, sewing-machines, &c., &c., &c.—very
much &c. Moreover, the goods are only the
trader’s goods for as short a time as he can
manage to get rid of them in, and after that they
are the buyer’s goods till they wear out, so the
buyer has much more right to be considered.
What the deputation meant was that it didn’t
want the public to be able to discriminate between
goods made by well-paid workmen and those made
by sweated labor, just in case the public has a
Conscience and, when they wouldn’t tell the
truth and shame the devil, there was really nothing
else to say. A significant feature of the busi-
ness was that it was mostly importers who spoke.
Although the Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers
was said to be represented even Derham isn’t re-
ported to have said anything, and it is a dull day
when Derham doesn’t “make a few remarks.”
The union label will, of course, be a hall-mark
that the goods are made in Australia, and made
by white labor paid a decent living wage; there-
fore, three great sections of the population should
barrack for it every time —the Protectionists,
who, in spite of all that has been said to the con-
trary, form more than half the whole voting
population; the White Australia party —which
is not composed altogether of adherents of
the Labor party, as many seem to suppose;
and the Labor party—any Labor man who doesn’t
barrack for it should be committed to an asylum
or the insane. It is only natural that the
importers, and the warehousemen who are largely
importers, should be on the other side. Of course,
only articles made in Australia will bear the union
label, and the staunch unionist and the patriotic
Australian will probably insist on having goods
bearing that label every time. As an incentive to
such people to buy Australian-made goods, the
clause should be worth as much as a small increase
in the tariff. For instance, at the present time a
lot of the condiments sold by high-class Sydney
shops are made by filthy Asiatics out Zetland
way, and in the slums of Surry Hills. When the
union label comes along, the Australian who
prefers his food made by men who are paid
sufficient wages to live clean, wholesome lives
will be able to make the vendor serve him
with what he wants. Sydney Telegraph
says this will constitute another interference
with the liberty of the subject. It will —that
is just where the blessedness of it comes in.
But the blessing isn’t all on one side. The anti-
unionist, also the employer of sweated labor, and
dirty labor, and nigger labor, won’t be interfered
with. He won’t be compelled to label his goods
“Made by a Hindu in a cellar.” For the first
time in his life he will stand out from the ruck, by
the want of a label on his goods, as a man who
“ breathes the air of freedom,” and one who
refuses to be “ground beneath the heel of union
tyranny.” Surely he ought to be a proud man,
instead of performing as if a fly had just dropped
into his soup.

Seddon’s Rush to the Old Precipice.
Either Premier Seddon libels his country, or
Maoriland is aching for another drunk. “It is
quite evident to the Government,” said Richard
in his Budget Speech a fortnight or so ago, “ that
there is a general consensus of opinion that more
rapid progress must be made in the construction
of our railways, and more bridges must be built,
and more roads undertaken and completed in our
backblocks.” Therefore, of course, more loans.
Seddon indeed talks of more vigorous borrowing
at the very moment that he talks of easing off
taxation. The country has become prosperous
through stopping the drain of wealth to feed the
absentee landlord and other parasites. In the
old days no other part of Australasia received
such a flood of foreign capital as Maoriland,
and instead of prosperity it brought nothing
but disaster. First Ballance and then Seddon
set to work at devising a policy which had
the effect, even if it hadn’t the purpose, not only
of stopping any further inflow of foreign capital,
but of sweeping out some of the flood that was in ;
and just in proportion to their success in that way
the State prospered. In the five years 1881-5
alone, the inflow of foreign capital for private in-
vestment in Maoriland amounted to £10,475,000 ;
and in 1891, at the beginning of the Ballance
regime, the State owed £20,500,000 on private
account alone. All told, there is now, according
to Ooghlan, only £9,500,000 of foreign capital in
private investments in the whole State—which
means that £11,000,000 of private debt has
been paid off. That is to say, there is less private
debt left now than was incurred during one brief
five years. Private debt—the investment of out-
side capital to develop “the great natural re-
sources of the country ” —only brought disaster ;
with the reduction of the debt came prosperity.
Yet, in the face of this obvious teaching, Seddon
continues to play with the fire. So far as
the State is concerned, he has never wholly given
up the habit. He has been curiously blind to the
fact that what was death to the State when prac-
tised by the people as individuals must be equally
fatal when practised by the people as a com-
munity. The symptoms are the same in either
case. The disease grows as it is fed. Consider
the rush of loan expenditure in the past eleven
years— Seddon’s eleven years:—
1895 .. .. £600,657 1901 .. .. £1,746,H1
1896 .. .. 972,195 1902 .. .. 2,890,767
1897 .. .. 1,089,590 1903 .. .. 2,285,198
1898 .. .. 1,134,812 1904 .. .. 2,935,975
1899 .. .. 1,543,683 1905 .. .. 2,389,785
1900 .. .. 1,571,604
And the deplorable part of the past year’s record
is that only £970,258 of the whole £2,389,785 was
spent upon undertakings which, by any stretch,
can be regarded as of a revenue-producing charac-
ter. But still the rush is not fast enough. “More
rapid progress must be made,” says the Premier.
“ We must rush to get rich,” in effect. And
he takes just the same road as the State took
20 years ago—a road which he knows well enough
led not to riches but to ruin. If it wasn’t so, then
the whole Ballance-Seddon policy had no justi-
fication whatever. ' If the old course was right,
then to go right back upon it, as Ballance did,
was utterly wrong. For some years the vigorous
repayment of private foreign debt —the violent
ejection of the foreign absentee’s capital which
had flowed in like a stream of curses to “develop
the splendid natural resources of the country ”
seems to have more than counterbalanced the
additions to the State debt. Maoriland was get-
ting out of pawn, and prospering on the process.
Seddon now seems to be tired of this steady
prosperity. Another boom is what he wants—
another boom and another burst.

The N.S.W. State Land Bank.
The N.S.W. Farmers’ and Settlers’ annual con-
ference has lifted the Sydney dailies on to a
rail, and for a week they have been struggling
to keep their balance and look as though they
liked it. All of them have, for many months past,
been making extra-tremendous efforts to get the
support (and the subscription) of “the man on the
land.” Each morning paper has given him a
department of his own, and fills pages with pic-
tures of the large pumpkin and the prize potato,
and they have been telling him that he is the
backbone of the country, and the lights and the
liver and everything else, in fact, that matters.
And, after he has been told all this, and ought to
be grateful, and purr nicely on the paper’s door-
mat, he conies down, instead, to his annual
conference, and fills it with curses on the city
daily papers, and unanimously decides that
he wants, among other things, a Land Bank built
up out of the two existing N.S.W. Savings Banks.
It is at this point that the papers take to the rail.
For, while they love the farmer as a brother, they
love the city importing and financial crowds (the
two crowds are practically the same crowd) as
another brother ; and if a State Land Bank gets
into operation, their brother who runs the private
bank will lose one of his safest and most profitable
customers. They are not game to say that the
farmer shouldn’t have a land bank—that he should
have to continue looking to the private bank for
assistance, and that, when the private bank won’t
look at him, he should starve to pay some private
Cohen 20 per cent, blood-money. In a vague
way they say that the farmer should have
his land bank ; all they do is to oppose
any definite scheme for giving it to him. They let
light into their real purpose, however, when they
point out that there are heaps of money lying in
the private banks. That is true enough. But it
is just as true that the banks don’t let that money
out unless they can make their dividends with it
—dividends that run up to 10 and 12 per cent. —
and the farmer wants money at a price that won’t
earn 10 or 12 per cent, dividends for any middle-
man. And he can get it most conveniently
through the Savings Banks. At present, if he
borrows from the private Cohen —often the auc-
tioneer and commission agent who hangs out his
shingle in every waybaclc town—the chances are
that he borrows money which has been lent to the
Savings Bank, and then lent by the Savings Bank
to the private bank, and after that lent by the
private bank to the private Cohen ; and by
the time the farmer gets it it is pretty dear
money. The daily papers’ assumption that
the original depositors don’t want to lend to
the farmer direct is perfectly gratuitous. They
have made no objection whatever. When Car-
ruthers’ previous Bill was before the House pro-
digious efforts were made to whip up opposition
from the so-called Barrack-street Bank depositors.
They were, it was announced, going to hold a
monster meeting of protest. But did anybody
hear of that meeting actually taking place ? And
yet the yarn that the Government proposes to lay
violent hands on the money of unwilling depositors
is persisted in; and Premier Carruthers is
spoken to severely as though he contemplated
burglary. The fact is that nobody’s money will
be taken unless he is perfectly willing that it
should be taken. If he isn’t willing, then he can
draw it out and start a combined bank and build-
ing society with it, and lose it. But, of course,
he won’t get any Government guarantee. Appar-
ently it is the Government guarantee that he
objects to, or that the papers say he objects to,
though there wasn’t any trace of the objection
when Premier George Dibbs saved the situation
for him in 1893.
*
It tears the hearts of the down-south papers to
put the Socialistic bogey in its grave; so, since
they can’t make capital out of the very moderate
platform adopted by the Australian Labor Con-
vention, which sat in Melbourne —a platform
which only provided for the State ownership of
monopolies—they scatter the idea that the
Queensland Laborites are furious and want
another convention held in order to put some
bombs into the Labor platform. But the fact is
that what the Queensland Parliamentary Labor
party wants is another Queensland State
convention to moderate the State platform.
Latter asks for State ownership of “ the
means of production, distribution and ex-
change”; the Queenslanders point out that “the
adoption of objectives which only concern the very
distant future is not the real business of a working
Parliamentary party.” Also, as to some other
extreme planks, left over from the callow
“ Socialism-in-our-time ” days of the Queensland
party, they point out that —
They can only have one result—namely, the bringing:
back to office of a powerful reactionary Conservative
Government.
Thus the Queensland movement isn’t, as the
down-south bogey-makers represent, a movement
to put bombs into the Federal platform; on the
contrary, it wants to bury all that is left of the
bombs that the northerners devised when they
were driven to desperation by the callous Mcll-
wraith crowd —the crowd that denied them the
franchise, and heaped debt and degradation upon
them.

One angry witness turned up before the N.S.W.
Lands Commission the other day to blow off some
long-bottled-up indignation— “ Baldy” Davis,
best known as the father of 19 Australians, and
for years W. N. Willis’ Parliamentary colleague.
Davis, who used to be a Western squatter, and
knew the land laws pretty well, said he always
stood fast against doing any land-jobbing business,
and held that, if there weren’t so many politicians
living on the game of land-agency, the land laws
wouldn’t be so involved and contradictory. It
was known to be Davis’s pet hobby ; and yet
time after time he got word from the Lands
Department that So-and-so had applied to
have some country thrown open for improve-
ment lease. He didn’t know the applicants
from goannas, and he reckoned that the
notices were a sort of intimation that there was
carrion about and that it was his turn to have a
peck; so at last he bounced up to the Lands
Department and told it that he didn’t want any
carrion, and that the officers needn’t send him
any more tips. So far, he seems to have been
about the only member, though, who didn’t accept
a trifle. Apropos this ex-M.L.A.’s contention
that, if it wasn’t necessary to hire a black tracker
to find your way through the N.S.W. land laws
those laws would be made a lot clearer, the U.S.
law prohibits senators, even when lawyers, prac-
tising before the Federal law departments. And the
law is put in force, too. Less than two months ago,
John H. Mitchell, a senator from Oregon, and
the State’s best-known barrister, was committed
for trial in New York on a charge of accepting
fees for doing work in the Federal law office at
Washington in violation of his oath.
A recent case at South Melbourne Court showed
that the “contract” clauses of the Immigration
Restriction Act are not as comprehensive as they
ought to be. The trouble was the frequent
one of certain “ boys of the bulldog breed ”
deserting a British ship, the Lombard.
They were named Lorenzo de Carlos, Emile
Bresseur, Romano Angelo, Philipino Ruggero,
and Sandy MThairson, and they practically ad-
mitted desertion. They all had a lot of wages due
to them, which they were quite willing to forego
if allowed to leave their ship, but their owner,
the captain, said they were good seamen, and he
would have to pay three times their wage to
get equally good men here, so he wanted
them back. They were under contract. They
had signed the ship’s articles at Liverpool and
were to return thither, yet the captain admitted
the vessel was trading up and down the Australian
coast, under foreign articles and at foreign rates
of pay—but not at foreign freights. Not only
were these sailors robbing the Australian seaman
of a job by doing what is rightfully his work at a
sweating wage, under a foreign contract; but
the foreign owners were also robbing the Aus-
tralian shipowner of some of his business and
profits under distinctly unfair terms. The Stink-
ing Fish party is such a worshipper of the
foreigner that it is even anxious to handicap the
Australian shipowner so that the foreigner may
get whatever jobs are going.

From Sydney Telegraph (9/8/’O5)
New South Wales cannot produce any manufactures
which are languishing through having had their subsidies
reduced, but it can point to many which, by having been
brought under contribution for the payment of such
subsidies to Victorians, have suffered no small hardship.
When our great primary industry was passing through
the severest drought known to Australian history, N.S.W.
settlers were prevented from importing fodder for their
starving stock without paying a duty for the benefit of
people in other States.
It is a pity the Telegraph doesn’t supply the
names of those N.S.W. manufactures which are
paying subsidies to Victorians. It would be
interesting to learn what they are and where they
are. As for the rest of the item, the duties paid
on fodder in N.S.W. did not, as this sour-minded
daily liar asserts, go to enrich anybody in any
other State. They were all paid over to the
N.S.W. State Government, and expended by it,
to the best of its limited intelligence, for the
benefit of the N.S.W. people. The Sydney Tele-
graph makes much of its living by this steady and
continuous policy of sowing malice and hatred
between States, and in the process of keeping
Australians apart there is no lie too mean and
degrading for its use. If the national spirit were
as strong as it should be, the very name of the
malicious rag would be accursed

Anderson’s revived melodrama in four acts, 12
scenes, six or eight murders and attempted mur-
ders, and five dozen assorted shocks and thrills. It
is, of course, just the old sausage with new spice
scattered through it ; and the combination of the
new and the old was amazingly popular when
Anderson ran it through a long season at Sydney
Lyceum eighteen months ago. It threatens to be
just as popular now at the Royal. It is one of
the few pieces in the Anderson playbox in which
Miss Duggan doesn’t wander through great
tribulation in three acts to the reward of
virtue in the fourth. This time she begins bad—
with a husband or two and a vermilion past
that have been disposed of before 8 p.m. She
drugs and murders (or thinks she does) a sea cap-
tain at 8.30, and winds up in a hospital at 10.45 by
shooting at the wrong man and then poisoning
herself. Her only serious competitor in the busi-
ness of getting rid of people is Laurence Dunbar,
and he doesn’t take his new profession as seriously
as he might. He seems a tired villain, and men-
tions any new scheme for killing off superfluous
inhabitants as though he were debating whether
he should order muffins or crumpets. George
Gross and Miss Guildford are called on to hold up
the end of virtue in this unequal conflict, and
though at various points it seems to be about 25
to 1 against Virtue, the white horse wins in the
end with lengths to spare. Miss Leighford makes
the bad woimin’s bad old mother as little shocking
as possible, and, as usual, Bert Bailey and Ethel
Buckley draw a thin thread of jokes through the
whole four acts of shudder, and give Virtue a lift
when it is bogged in a deeper bog than usual.

Andrew Mack’s season at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney) will conclude with “Jack Shannon,” to
be put on for the first time on Saturday night.
Meantime “Shaun the Post” is undergoing great
mental anguish, and making love outside the cabin
door, and singing “The Wearing of the Green,”
and generally being a picturesque central figure in
extra-good scenic surroundings. And the colleen
he makes love to is one of the brightest features of
the whole season.

At Sydney Criterion John F. Sheridan is
preparing in the Departmentof Original Research a
musical farce. The name of thegreatpieceis “Mrs.
Dooley’s Joke ” and it will be as good a joke as it
knows how to be for six nights exactly, commencing
on Saturday. These six nights will be the last
of the present season. The fact that John F.
Sheridan will be Mrs. Dooley is almost too obvious
to be worth mentioning, and the suspicion that
Mrs. Dooley will wear her hair and her brogue
something after the fashion of Mrs. Widow
O’Brien is pretty general. For to-night and to-
morrow night “The Earl and the Girl” will wend
their giddy girly way as usual.
Mr. Edwin Geach
intimates (a good

“ Milo,” at Sydney Tivoli, has added to
her repertoire, and is now the Venus de Medici as
well as numerous other famous pieces of classic
statuary. Miss Challis, a dramatic songster, up-
holds her reputation as something better than the
ordinary ; Stillwell juggles with flags and hand-
kerchiefs, and less successfully with cards ; the
Lazeras trio tie themselves into various knots;
Leo Dryden is using up the last of his limelight to
eke out a performance that doesn’t loom as large
as his name does on the bills ; and other features of
a good average show are much as they were a week
ago.
** * *
“Quality Street,” the comedy by J. M.
Barrie which is putting in a week or two at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, should be rushed by spinsters
of uncertain age. The women characters are all
spinsters, young or fairly matured in the first act,
and nine years older in the following acts. Their
bonnets are of the 1806 to 1816 pei’iod, and they
wear pattens when out walking in wet weather.
As a matter of fact, they don’t walk out in
the play, but it is noticed that the younger
Miss Throssell removes tier pattens when she
re-enters her Quality-street domicile after a brief
absence. There are two Misses Throssell and a
plump, matured handmaiden living on the pre-
mises, the other women being neighboring inno-
cents of a prying character, who call and exchange
curtseys and greetings with the sisters. The
gentle monotony of this existence is disturbed by
a man named Brown—Valentine Brown—a worthy
fellow, who appears as a dashing hero of romance
to the Misses Throssell. He had kissed Phoebe —
the younger sister—when escorting her home from
chapel, or somewhere, and therefore she loved him
ever afterwards. The other sister would have been
equally affected by the same kiss, but it was
Phoebe’s luck to get it. Brown, unconscious of
the sweet devotion he had excited, went to the
wars, and fought beside Bill Adams and others
for nine years, whilst Phoebe and Susan battled
for a living by trying to teach the young idea how
to shoot. Their scholars gave them all the
‘‘cheek” of the period. They were a pair of
simple, sorrowful old maids, with their heads en-
closed in woollen caps, praying to God and speak-
ing often of Brown. When Brown turned up
again—a captain minus an arm—he was politely
shocked at the awful change in Phoebe, brought
about mainly by her cap. Phoebe, feeling the
shock, revolted against her dismal fate. The girl of
nine years ago was born again in her. She gave
her ringlets a show; she danced, she frisked,
and next time she saw Brown she introduced her-
self as her own niece (although she hadn’t any
niece, Lord forgive her !), and in her new character
she said things that caused Brown to think very
tenderly of her alleged aunt Phoebe. So in due
course Phoebe’s dream became a reality, and Susan
likewise was made happy by a kiss from her
brother-in-law elect. The vanity of both sexes is
gratified by such plays. Women like to contem-
plate a picture of wondrous feminine modesty and
grace ; men revel in the thought of their eternal
importance where Phoebe and Susan are concerned.
But there must be some capacity for delicate senti-
ment in the public that supports “Quality Street,”
and it is not yet certain that the general
taste was expressed by liberal bursts of applause
last Saturday night. The idyll is not free from
puerility. The humor of the “comic” scenes is
almost too light, the very funniest thing in the
entertainment being the opportune snigger of a
schoolboy when he is threatened with chastise-
ment. And the interest taken in the story is only
a patronising interest during the last two acts, for
everybody guesses how it will end. There is
nothing much in Barrie’s poem to compel the
.sympathy of unimaginative people, but on the
other hand there is plenty of mild incident to keep
the attention engaged.
* * *
Phoebe, the principal character, is charm-
ingly played by Miss Winifred Eraser, who personi-
fiesingenuousnessmuch better than she represented
cold-blooded artfulness in “Jericho.” Missßeatrice
Hay adapts herself fairly well to the older maidish
part of Susan, though she might seem a little more
troubled after the nine years have elapsed. Brough
is, of course, a satisfactory Valentine Brown (not
more than that), and Miss Bessie Major shakes up
the quiet situations with her cheery impersonation
of the maid-servant who never despairs of picking
up a husband. The small parts are carefully
dressed and acted. “Quality Street ” cannot run
beyond Thursday next in any case, for the season
closes on the 24th.

Mrs. Brough’s one consecutive appearance
last week revealed that popular favorite as a some-
what more ample Niobe than of old, bringing
trouble into the household of the same Petramos
Brough. Other members of the household included
a specially bright edition (by Miss Gordon Lee) of
the 15-year-old damsel in short frocks, and the
comedy went with a good deal of its early vigor.
But the Brough-Flemming co. is not quite strung
up to farcical comedy pitch.

The fresh and lively revivals of Gilbert
and Sullivan by the Reperfoire Company are “ a
well-merited success ” at Her Majesty’s, and Mel-
bourne feels sorry that the season is limited to
three weeks. Another crowded house last Satur-
day gave ‘ ‘ The Pirates ” a warm reception. In
“ The Pirates ” the Gilbertian humor seems less
polished and subtle than in the more satirical,
operas, but the policemen are a joke that hits the
popular understanding very hard. Ernest Fitts,
for the first time in Melbourne, shaped admirably
as the sergeant—the most effective man in the
part since J. C. Williamson played it—and the
other new-comer, Walter White, was at least a
sweet-voiced Frederick. “The Mikado” is the
bill from Wednesday to Friday this week. On
Saturday theco. will appear in “lolanthe,” which
gives the chorus the best of all its chances to do
credit to its training.

At the Royal, the other night, Bland Holt
disclosed a new drama, “ Besieged in Port
Arthur,” to a huge crowd of White Australians,
who enthused over the stage-representatives of
Japan and hooted their non-colored opponents as
if to be a small brown man was a virtue in itself.
One excuse for this marked partiality for Eng-
land’s bantam ally is to be found in the attitude
taken by the joint authors of the play, who have
persistently painted the Mikado’s monkeys as
pocket-patriots and undersized heroes, while the
Muscovy bear is depicted as a brutal Iscariot.
* * * *
The story deals with the troubles of one
Frank Forrester (Walter Baker), a money-squan-
dering, British booby, soft-headed, sound-hearted,
white-handed —in short, Bellowdrama’s favorite
son. This attractive Englander is beloved by
Saydee (Jap for Sarah ?), the one fair daughter of
rich, old Mr. Orama (Arthur Styan), described
rhymingly on the programme as “ a fine old Jap,
whose manners tell that England picks her allies
well.” Albert Norman is a Muscovite speculator,
who loves Sarah (Frances Ross) in his brusque
Russian way, so different from her other admirer’s
best British affection. When Sarah spurns the Slav
person’s Bruinlike garesses, he vows that “the day
shall come ” when she will plead too late to share
his name and address. The heroine of melodrama
always is threatened in this shocking way, and
be-rated with terms such as “toy,” “minion,”
and “mistress,” if she scorns the villain’s prof-
fered hand. Off the stage a fiasco of this kind is
apt to close with polite verbiage on both sides re
the state of the weather. Bland Holt, imper-
sonating The Billetin’s special artist at the seat
of war, is understood to represent a typical free,
v'hite Australian. He sports a larrikin-forehead-
fringe, and when he volunteers to ride on a
desperate war mission for the noble Japanese, he
mounts his patient gee-gee in true Horsetrylian
style, vaulting on to the placid beast like a
circus artist. On opening night Bland missed
this feat first attempt, but got on better the second
time. Mrs. Bland Holt is well-placed as an
American lady press-correspondent, who wins the
affections of The Billetin’s war-artist; and
Charles Brown endeavors to suggest a boss Jap
warrior, given to sermonising lengthily to his
braves on the eve of action.
> * * *
First act of “Besieged in Port Arthur ”
promises better than subsequent developments of
the plot justify. Miss Ross has some attractive
business, and the rich, patriotic, old Orama gets a
manly representation from Styan. Later, the
drama becomes sketchy, shuffling along in a
series of shreds and patches, mere suggestions
of melodramatic situations, not developed or
worked out. Just as well, perhaps, that
they remain rough outlines, for, after the
promising start, events seem to have been selected
haphazard from the hackneyed old “shocker”
cupboard. There are the familiar abductions,
attempted murders, false accusations, comic
escapes from prison, etc. But, as usual, Bland
Holt has let himself go in thd item of gorgeous
stage tableaux. The scenery round Port Arthur,
the battle of Liao Yang, the doomed Russian
ships waiting in the roadstead, the explosion of a
submarine mine—all these are in Brunton’s best
manner, regardless of expense. Moreover, a pic-
turesque Russian ballet and a dance by the Bick-
nells prevent the horrors of stage war from becom-
ing tedious. Russ and Jap. uniforms abound, and
Harrie Ireland, as adventuress of the story, main-
tains a standard of up-to date sartorial magnifi-
cence, calculated to make Port Arthur famous as
a centre of dress and fashion.

The Orpheus Society (August 8) drew a
crowd which filled Melbourne’s Town Hall.
Heermann, pere, played instead of his sick son,
and the audience applauded the substitute, fully
conscious that their luck was in, when Violinist
Major filled the gap left by Fiddler Minor.
Gov. Talbot and party lent their counten-
ance to the concert, and, take one triumph
with another, conductor Clutsam, coming fast
to the front as a Musical Personage, had
some excuse for looking as perky as if he
had just picked up a £lO note supposed to
lie authentic. Some of his own songs were to the
fore on the programme, notably the “Skeleton’s
Serenade,” a gruesome thing, describing the pro-
ceedings of a cadaver, who, even in death, evi-
dently continued to act the ladies’ man, and went
around frivolously in his bones.
** * #
Alfred C. Bottoms got on excellently
t’other night (August 10) at his recital in Glen’s
Hall, Mr. Bottoms is the lucky owner of a fine
voice, rich in mellow notes and natural sympathy,
and greatly improved in “culchaw” since he sang
at the first of the Amy Castles’ farewell concerts,
some five years ago. Not particularly showy or
robust in appearance to start with, he is acquiring
a good platform style and deportment, and hearers
feel persuaded that he will do well in the future.
Kara, steadily improving in health and
jugglery, remains the principal feature at the
Opera House ; also Beatrice of the Saxophone is
still blowing music fo:- an admiring public, and
the Kelly who gets casual assistance from Agnes,
has established himself in favor. The fault in
Kelly’s clever work is the repellent ugliness of his
“make-up.” Sometime in the dim past an
American variety artist introduced the novelty of
a grotesque Tramp—a thing of rags and tatters
and beery appearance—and many subsequent
comedians have perpetuated that original con-
ception of low-down manhood. The subsequent
Kelly would be more pleasantly droll if he acted
as a clean and tidy advertisement for somebody’s
two guinea suits.
From Adelaide
“The Cingalee,” making a sumptuous appearance at
Adelaide Royal, proves to rely mainly on fine mounting
and one strong character part. Whether it really re-
sembles any unacted piece—as urged in the recent London
lawsuit—must remain uncertain ; but the author of “ The
Geisha ” seems to have been justified when he declared in
the witness-box that both had borrowed freely from him.
The local potentate who makes off with the heroine is
here again, only in a Ceylon setting; and tea-picking girls
replace the tea-house girls. The final curtain falls on
two English maidens about to wed two “ big black bound-
ing beggars,” and the titled English johnnie betrothed to
a native girl, so the Colored Brother scores heavily.
The music of the piece is adequate, but not specially
haunting. The play revolves round one Chambuddy
Ram, developed (by special permission) from Anstey’s
educated Hindu. He claims with pride to have “failed
B.A. at Oxford College,” he “made a centurion in the
Rugger match,” he “ rowed in the Oxford boatrace from
Putney to Boulogne, and bumped Cambridge at Tatten-
ham Corner.” He addresses a judge as “ most venerable
and respected first-class old cock,” and refuses to kill the
golden calf that laid the fatted eggs. Eor once, a come-
dian in musical comedy need do no more than say the
lines written for him, and George Lauri (in an excellent
make-up) gives them full point. Margaret Thomas —late
of the conceit platform—sings like a lark, and acts unex-
pectedly well.

The balance-sheet as presented to Parliament shows
reserves of £132,094 (Assurance Fund, £125,724, and unap-
propriated profit, £6370). But on the other side is a paper
asset, “ Loan flotation charges, £178,466.” Deducting the
latter, we get the deficit shown. Owing to the loans
having been raised at 3 p.c., they have only been secured
at a heavy discount, and the amount of the discount is
still shown in this item as an asset. Had the money been
got at par it would, of course, have cost more in interest;
but in that case this fictitious asset would not have been
a blot upon the accounts. The true profits are thus less
than is shown above. In 3 per cents £2,000,000 has been
raised ; if that carried 3J per cent, instead of 3, interest
would amount to £lO,OOO a year more and the profits to
£lO,OOO a year less. Certainly, when the present deficit
has been wiped out, the lower interest-charge will make
the progress of the department appear more rapid. But
that won’t represent the true position, any more than the
present deficit suggests the past success of the depart-
ment’s operations ; for a successful concern, which didn’t
have to buy a business or a name, shouldn’t have a deficit.
The operations are still expanding, though this
year, for the first time, the repayments total more than
the advances. For a few years there possibly will be a
movement that way. In the first few years advances
were made in large quantities not only to make new
improvements but to wipe out liabilities to the private
Cohen ; and these loans are now being repaid, while the
number of settlers who are left with Cohens that they
want to get rid of is comparatively small. Hence the
repayments will for a time be abnormal, while the
advances will be normal. That, under Maoriland’s policy
of Protection, land-tax, land settlement, and arbitration,
the settlers are able to make the repayments, even
though they are abnormal, is shown by the fact that the
department has not had a single security left on its
hands. The overdue instalments amount to only £1734
and £1,402,923 has been repaid. The record is a remark-
able one. And yet when a State Land Bank is mention ed
in N.S.W., the interested crowd of private money-lenders
always say that every politician would land constituents
on the mat by the dray-load, and fill up the office with
rotten securities ! As to expenses, they are getting
smaller and smaller, both actually and in proportion to
business done. Dating from the year when the office
settled down to normal business, this is how things stand :

The sinking fund for the extinction of the capital debt of
the department now amounts to £193,887 ; this is invested
with the Public Trustee, and is apart from the assurance
fund (£125,724), which is also with the Trustee. The
total capital debt is £3,200,000, of which, as shown above,
£2,753,182 is out in advances, and the balance is repre-
sented by the two items mentioned above, and the deplor-
able “loan flotation charges, £178,466,” also previously

The dimensions of the approaching Westralian
slump may be guessed at from one thing : The State’s
customs and excise revenue was £102,224 in July, 1904,
and only £69,953 in July, 1905. Yet it is still above the
average of the other States—to get down to the average
it should have been about £50,000. Westralia made the
usual mistake of regarding its loan and gold boom con-
ditions as normal conditions, and it rioted round so
gloriously that it outran the constable even with all the
boom. On a rough estimate, when things reach the
normal, Westralia will require to cut its expenditure per
head down about one-half to be really solvent.

The phenomenally large increase in profits of the previous
three or four years has not been maintained. Compared
with previous year the gross revenue was £134,349 as
against £140,760. In both years £5OOO was written off
premises ; last year, notwithstanding the reduced profit,
£3500 instead of £2500 was contributed to the officers’
pension fund, while working expenses moved up from
£70,414 to £73,511. Thus about £6500 of the diminished
profit is due to lower earnings and the balance to heavier
expenses. The figures explain part of the shrinkage in
profits:—

The electric plant of the Federal Palace Hotel,
corner Collins and King-streets, Melbourne, furnishes a
good example of a thoroughly successful electric installa-
tion, in technical as well as in commercial respects. This
plant generates all electric current required for the hotel
lighting; it consists of a twenty horse-power gas-engine
belted to a “ Ganz ” twelve kilowatts dynamo, a “ Ganz ”
switch-board containing all the measuring and controlling
instruments, and a storage battery with 62 cells. The
generating machinery runs continually during the day
time at its full capacity and highest efficiency, the surplus
current bein&’ stored into the battery \ the latter supplies
all necessary electricity required during the night; and it
forms also a substantial reserve in case of accidents.
Compared with the previous method of working, a saving
of £4OO per annum has been effected by this plant, the
contractors for which were the Austral Otis Engineering
Company, Ltd., corner Hanah and Kavanagh-streets,
South Melbourne, as sole Australian agents for Ganz and

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

The increased deposits, presumably to a great extent
interest-bearing-, are represented almost wholly by
coin, bullion, and money at short call, earning either
nothing at all or very little ; and this explains a good
deal. The keener competition in exchange business pro-
bably explains the rest. Still, even with the reduced
profits, the Maoriland National has one of the best-paying
banking businesses in Australasia. Its profits on total
shareholders’ funds (capital £250,000 and reserves) have
moved in this way :
1900 £l3 13 2 per cent. I 1903 £l3 7 2 per cent.
1901 16 10 6 „ 1904 13 17 2 „
1902 17 12 7 „ I 1905 10 13 11
The rapid fall is, of course, partly due to the rapid growth
of the reserves in proportion to the very modest capital.
Even now, however, it shows a higher return than any
Australian bank, or any foreign bank doing business in
Australia. The Australasia, with £lO Is. 9d. p.c., comes
nearest to it. And it still maintains in liquid assets a
fair, though not excessive, 26 p.c. of its total liabilities to
the public. Under the Radical and Protectionist policy
of Maoriland highly profitable use can thus be found for
capital ; while in parts of Australia, where another sort
of policy is being tried, the money is piling up in the
banks, till the banks have to cut down deposit rates. And
what the foreign capitalist, who is supposed to swoon
every time “ Socialistic legislation ” is mentioned, really
thinks of it can be gauged by the fact that this one bank
is trusted with deposits (largely foreign—it is an English
concern) amounting to seven times the total of share-
holders’ funds.

Total £198,935
The reduction of capital includes forfeiture of some
few ordinary shares on which calls had not been paid.
The preference shares have a 5 per cent, preference ;
deferred preference and ordinary shares participate in
any dividend declared, out of the surplus profits of each
half-year, in proportion to the amounts paid ; and surplus
realisations go to a reserve for the benefit of the deferred
preference and ordinary shares in a like proportion. Pre-
ference shareholders are therefore entitled to the first
£4190 per half-year. But it would only require another
£783 to pay 5 per cent, all round. Still, the bank is a
long way from the first £4190 so far.
Though the writings-down have been severe,
they seem by no means too severe. The profits for the
past half-year were much above the average, yet they
Show only £3 Bs. 3d. per cent, per annum on the new
Capital. Properties in possession, which stood at
£1,013,100, were written down to £329,813, and now
(through some realisations) have been reduced to £316,857.
Even at the last figure they show a net return at the rate
of only £2 17s. Bd. per cent, per annum. Still, it has to
be remembered that £144,293 of the total is represented
by vacant land, which is probably returning little or
nothing, so the rental return isn’t an infallible
guide to the truth of the valuation. But, anyhow, it
means this : that, though the worth of the money may be
there, and may eventually be realised, the return mean-
time is likely to be very poor ; and, as pointed out, gains
from realisations go to a reserve, and not to swell divisible
profits. As to new business, apparently a little more is
being done, but it still amounts to very little ; 12 months
ago advances were stated at £46,740, while now “debts
due to the bank,” which is apparently the same item,
amount to £98,150. The deposits are practically unaltered;
they stand at £365,877, and are practically all interest
bearing. This at any rate doesn’t oblige the bank to hold
much of a coin reserve. If it did, one can hardly see how
as much profit could be shown as the bank does show.
Even as it is, it pays away regularly in interest a trifle
more than it receives by way of interest and profit on
ordinary investments.

The capital is £274,506 ; on that it is hardly necessary to
figure out what even the improved profit amounts to.
And, anyhow, the increase in the reported profit must
not be taken too seriously ; it simply means that it hap-
pened that rather less than usual was spent on repairs
during the half-year. As to the progress made in clearing
up the trouble, it is best to look back over, say,
three years. In that time the debenture debt (with
interest) has been reduced by £72,945 and the other debt
by £BOB, while the advances and other such securities
have been reduced by £110,607, and the cash, &c., by
£347. Meantime £25,309 has been called up. Thus it has
required £110,607 of securities and £25,656 of cash to wipe
out £73,753 of debt. The debentures have, of course,
been bought at a discount, otherwise their reduction
would have called for a much larger sacrifice of assets.
There still remain £539,122 of debentures ; against them
are £710,561 of advances and similar assets and £73,935 of
cash, &c. If it took £110,607 of securities and £25,656 of
cash to wipe out £73,753 of debt, how much will be left to
shareholders from the £710,561 of advances and £73,935 of
cash, &c., after£s39,l22 of debentures have been wiped out?
Say, three times more cash and seven times more advances,
&c., to pay seven times more debt. ’ The prospect of any-
thinn- being- left over, or of debentures being worth any-
more than'they have been fetching, isn’t cheerful at that
rate. Certainly a revival of land values would alter
everything. But that is only a remote off-chance.

Maoriland municipalities are mostly cut out of
the same piece as the State—they want to do things, but
don’t want to pay for them. Dunedin, whose name
smells of caution and a wholesome regard for a receipted
bill is a case in point. In eight years its expenditure has
drifted along from £39,329 to £57,736 ; but its revenue
has only moved from £37,968 to £46,150. In 1897 it nearly
paid its debts like an honest Scotchman—it was only
£1361 short. But in the past year it went £11,586 into
debt. Its overdraft was £37,445 in 1897 ; it is now £88,989.
It has thus simply drifted into an unauthorised debt of
nearly £loo,ooo—drifted into it to pay the dustman for re-
moving last week’s dirt, and the street-sweeper for re-
moving last year’s orange-peel.

The paid capital is £19,624, an increase of £5624 during
the year; the whole of this is in either fixed deposits
or Melbourne Board of Works debentures. The business
is so far mainly in the risky marine-insurance line,
a business in which the heavy losses are supposed
to be more or less counterbalanced by a low expense
rate. As a matter of fact, the marine insurance
co., or the co. that does a large amount of that business,
rarely shows as much profit in proportion to premiums as
the ordinary fire office ; on the other hand, it hasn’t (if it
is well managed) the same-sized skeleton in its cupboard,
labelled “conflagration hazard.” This co.’s figures for
the year are not abnormal as to either losses or expenses.
Previous year’s profits were abnormal—probably because
the co. reckoned all premiums received as income for the
year, and made insufficient provision for unexpired risks.
Position at present seems sound ; the capital is sub-
stantial ; the business, for a young office, is large, and
the expense rate low ; and if the co. would content itself
with a small div. for a while, and build up its reserves, it
should have a future. Previous year’s 8 p.c. was absurd ;
past year’s 6 p.c. is better; but for a co. that probably
hasn’t any more than enough reserves to cover outstand-
ing risks, a much larger lay-by is called for.

The figures in the last line showing total paid to share-
holders and the reserves are necessarily approximate
only ; the amount of the bonus is not available. Further,
this year it is only payable to such shareholders as “ have
not benefited from the reduction of 33J per cent, on
their fire business ’’—another indication of the remarkable
slump in fire premiums which has followed on the hanging
of a Fire Insurance shingle outside a State office. But, in
spite of bavins- to cut down premiums by one-third, the
co-operative office shows the largest profits in the past 10
years. A comparison :

Losses p.c. of Premiums .. 41-5 47-3 27'9
Expenses p.c. of Premiums 35 - 8 35'7 37'9
The larger profit has thus been wholly due to an uncom-
monly good experience in the matter of losses—the year’s
rate is one of the lowest in Australasia, and certainly can’t
be depended upon to last. In addition to that, the
interest earnings on investments have been £4 12s. lOd.
on the average of all assets, which is absolutely the best
showing of all Australasian offices. True,- tbe money is
almost all out on mortgage, which accounts for it; and
mortgages may be risky securities or otherwise—it
depends on the management to a great extent.

Paul Morton, the front-rank U.S. statesman
who was induced to give up politics for a time and
become president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
and help lift it out of its troubles, has wired out to the
Sydney directors—“ Nobody here questions stability of
Equitable. Policy-holders have no cause for uneasiness.
You can safely give your personal assurance to this
effect.” If the policies are not perfectly safe, the
balance-sheets must have certainly been something
colossal in the way of false statements ; and they don’t
look like that. Of the total funds (£84,546,275), no less
than £16,582,672 was, at the end of last year, reckoned as
surplus—that is, funds in excess of the amount necessary
to meet all policy obligations, as fixed by actuarial calcu-
lations. As a matter of fact, if -there weren’t a huge
surplus in all probability there wouldn’t be any row.

The “ written-off” column is put in for the co.’s encour-
agement. In this matter there has been a curious little
movement. In 1903 a small item, “ Steamer Renewal
Account,” was among the reserves. Next year it had
been changed into “ Renewal and Depreciation Account.”
This year it is plain “Depreciation Account.” And
as (until this year at any rate) nothing had been
formally written off the steamers which bump many times
a day against the wharves, probably next year the item had
better be wiped out altogether. That would leave the
reserves at £846, which is probably nearer the mark than
the present figures. The disclosed profits are on the
down grade ; but something may be said on the other
side. Previously, as mentioned above, nothing was
written off for depreciation ; this year “ depreciation ” is
bunched with “ rent, fees, wages, repairs, &c.” A three-
years comparison :

Apparently, then, £9OO hjis been written off steamers
during the year. That being so, there has been a very
satisfactory'increase in revenue, without anything extra
in the way of working expenses'; and, though profits are.
very moderate, and the co.’s position far from strong, the
movement, so far as profit is concerned, is nevertheless
better than the table (based on the published accounts)
would suggest.

The position for the last three years calls for some
explanation, since some of the figures for 1903 and
1904 don’t agree with those in previously published tables.
Under an agreement with debenture-holders, made in
1901 or thereabouts, £lOOO a year was to be put aside
as a reserve to cover depreciation. Previously this amount
was shown year by year as written off. But as it accu-
mulated at compound interest, and as, on a further
arrangement with debenture-holders, the sum total
(£3100) has only now been formally written off assets, the
position as shown above seems, from one point of view,
to more correctly describe the situation. In addition to
the £3lOO written off from this special fund, accumulated
in 1902-3-4, £l5OO is now written off as wear and tear for
the past year. The outstanding debentures have been
reduced from £21,150 to £15,862 under the same agree-
ment, partly with the reserve (kept in Government
securities) mentioned above. As for current operations,
they are still restricted and not very profitable, owing to
the want of Protection and the uncertainty in which the
late Reid Government kept Queensland with regard to
the sugar bonus ; and the fourth year running has to pass
without a dividend. And yet some people vvonder why
money accumulates in the banks instead of being put into
industrial enterprises, and some others regard Walkers’ as
a bloated monopoly.

Shareholders’ capital is £lOO,OOO and debenture capital
£30,000, and on the whole lot the return for the past year
was £3 3s. per cent. ; for the half-year alone, at the rate
of £1 3s. per cent, per annum. As the debentures carry
4 per cent., or considerably more than the money is
earning, things are pretty sad for the shareholders. Yet
the Deniliqui n and Moama line serves one of the best
way-out districts in N.S. Wales, and caters for a
better traffic than almost any other purely country
line. The sorrowful record conveys some broad hints.

reproductive as any), and that the debt we have needn’t
worry us, or stop us from piling up more. (2) The Labor
party says it won’t borrow for any more works if they
won’t pay interest and 1 per cent, sinking fund. That
practically bars loans for any more country railways. The
Labor party will, therefore, have to make up its mind to
have no more country lines or resolve to build them out
of revenue. The latter is the proper thing to do.

Profits for the half-year represent £7 12s. 3d. per cent,
per annum on shareholders’ funds (capital £lO,OOO and
reserves). What the investments earn cannot be ascer-
tained, as all receipts are lumped into one item. Five
years ago this item was £682 ; it is now £1222. Expenses
then were £302 ; now £404. It has therefore cost £lO2 to
earn £540, which is good business.

Nothing having been charged for wear and tear of plant
for a couple of years past, the profit shown for 1905 was
not earned. In any case the div. of 5 per cent, was
excessive. The co. has overdrafts amounting to £3195.
It has an excessive amount of £2373 of book debts ; still
about the only satisfactory feature which the accounts
disclose is the slight reduction of this item during the
year. The position calls for a prompt rednctioasof the
dividend ; or, since it should have been reduced long ago,
it might be passed altogether for a year or two.

The banana business seems highly profitable—anyway, to
the co. that lets out the stalls. On capital (£5000) and
reserves, last year’s profits showed £lO 11s. p.c. But the
div. is too high in view of the heavy debt: On a capital
of £5OOO the co. has borrowed (with interest) £5125 on
debentures, £9595 on mortgage, and £461 on overdraft;
total, £15,186. Every cent of its own and the borrowed
money is in the building where the spring onion comes
from ; and if disaster should strike the spring onion and
mustard-cress in a couple of droughty years, this little co.
would find itself paying calls. And as most of the share-
holders are in the water-cress line themselves, the double
disaster would about crumple them up. Twelve months
ago the directors proposed a 6 p.c. div., but the share-
holders altered it; the board ought to dare them to be as
foolish again.

Gold yield of W.A. for first seven months of
year was 1,131,3730 z. fine against 1,145,3340 z. in 1904—a
shortage of 13,9610 z. It is not a very serious deficiency,
but it seems likely it will increase, as several mines
are looking anything but rosy.

Golden Horseshoe, Kalgoorlie. in spite of direc-
tors’ assurance that no more ore would be sent to smelters,
continues to get the bulk of returns that way. During
June, 19,200 tons were milled for 40640 z., or 4'23dwt. per
ton, while -2000 tons were smelted for 90970 z. Cost of
railage and smelting on 2000 tons comes to £B6OO, a large
amount to pay away monthly. Bulk of ore is so poor
that it almost looks as if a lot of mullock were being-
treated to maintain tonnage.
North end of Kalgoorlie field is not looking so
promising, although much prospecting is still being done.
Hidden Secret bonanza shoot has petered out, and no
work has been done to try and pick it up again. Two or
three shareholders have been splashing' their cash under
the idea that the shoot would last for ever, and now
cannot afford to pay up calls for prospecting'. Looks un-
commonly like their eventually being starved out. Mine
still has a promising lode, but ore is not more than
lOdwt. per ton, and this won’t pay under the. present
system. Next blocks north and south have found nothing'
payable so far. Fairplay, on north-east, is still on good
ore, but work is very limited. Devon Consols South
Extended has been more or less hung up during negotia-
tions for flotation in Adelaide, but these are concluded.
Although several shafts have been sunk in locality during
past nine months, possibilities of ground are still practi-
cally unknown.
* * * *
Boulder Deep Levels, Kalgoorlie, is now in an
interesting stage of development. Lode has been cut at
1100 ft., about 218 ft. south of shaft, and it depends greatly
on how it pans out whether co. is to be a success or
failure. At 900 ft., though results were not very gaudy,
they were good enough to make a payable mine, as mines
are now worked on the fields. If 1100 ft. confirms known
results, prospects of co. becoming a regular producer are
pretty good. Test erushings from 900 ft. of 2524 tons
yielded 14950 z., exclusive of 6dwt. in tailings, which is
fairly good for a 7ft. lode. Last call of Is. per share was
made in March, and should have realised £14,000 if fully
met. This should keep concern going till end of year at
least.

The aftermath to the trial of James
Edwards comes in the form of a “ poem—price
one penny; written and composed by William
Purtell, brother of James Purtell.” Murder
poetry, like gout and Freetrade, seems to run in
families. William, having taken over the busi-
ness, follows brother James in fondness for real-
istic detail. Thus:—
He chopped the man to pieces, even hacked the lifeless
<jtce.
No living human witness his cruel actions spied,
The remains threw in a channel, as being the safest place,
Forgetting that from God he could not hide.
A CAUSE OF GREY HAIRS.
S HE: How grey and old-looking your cousin is
getting!"
H E: “ Yes, it's through worry. He is writing
a book, The Secret of Perpetual Youth:'”
The cables loyally reported the opening of
Alexandra Horne in London, a charity for dis-
tressed widows and orphans of British officers,
built by the Queen at a cost of £lB,OOO. Then, a
long while after, the English papers come along
vyith the news th,at the money was bequeathed to
the Queen for the especial purpose by a Liverpool
citizen. Apparently there wasn’t a shilling of
royal money in the whole building.
About a sweep :
On the whole the art union seems a good thin" for
churches and charities to keep clear of, unless driven to
it by dire impecuniosity. St. Vincent’s Hospital (Mel-
bourne) had one lately, and the result was worse than
sinful—it was ridiculous. According to the mixed con-
fessions of Naughton, the man w'ho has been run in a
very large number of the chances were not sold, and’as
all the marbles were in the barrel it became necessary
when a number was drawn, to refer to the unsold tickets’
If the prize fell to an unsold ticket another marble was
supposed to be drawn. The man who was run in supplied
the marbles and the barrel, and helped at thedrawin".
By the cussedness of dead objects it chanced—accordin’"
to one of his explanations—that four out of the five
marbles that came out bore numbers which hadn’t been
sold, and each time this person savs he referred to
the unsolds ’ and artfully pocketed the ticket, and
reported that the matter was all right. Then he went
out of an innocent and unsuspecting hospital with the
tickets. A later explanation by the same man is that he
bought five tickets and faked the barrel itself, and that
all live pnzes were g'ot by him or his confederates. Any-
how, he set to work to collect the prizes in various
names, and the first prize caused all the trouble
It was collected in the name of Charles Watson, of
York-street, South Melbourne, and there chanced to be a
real man of that name in the street. This wouldn’t have
happened if the man who presented the docket and took
the money had signed as Job Hobbletank. The real
Watson wrote saying that he hadn’t got any £3OO The
bogus Watson wrote from two different places to allay
suspicion saying that he had got the £3OO, and that he
used to be a O. Watson, of York-street, only he had re-
moved. The real Watson still made trouble. Then people
began to wonder about F. Harrison, who had drawn
another prize, and who might have been a good deal safer
if lie had called himself Augustus Jobling. So the
problem drifted along on a sea of suspicion, till at last,
tor want of the anchorage of a producible O. Watson
with a fixed and discoverable address, and for lack of a
visible F. Harrison, it brought up against a police court.
there were quite a number of curious side issues in the
oase, which showed a lamentable want of business instinct
on the part of the management. Naughton, the man now
in trouble, says he collected one prize on the strength of a
lorged receipt from a non-existent person. Two other
prizes were paid into a banking account he had opened in
a bogus name, at the written request of a bogus applicant,
who gave his address as Collins-street—just Oollins-street.
Ihe whole course of application for these fraudulently-
W .°l\ pr l ‘? es bore a suspicious appearance, but the treasurer
of the sweep ” funds seems to have not even noticed
that none of the bogus prize-winners gave a fully satis-
factory address, and that two winners were supposed to
be related to one another in such a way that both prizes
were paid into the same banking account. Apparently
charity makes some men very unsuspicious.

Judge Eagleson, of Victoria, did his little
best to make two young people happy at last Mel-
bourne Sessions. Having passed several severe
sentences, he came to the case of a young woman
convicted of receiving a five-guinea fur jacket.
Her lawyer pleaded for leniency on the ground
that she was about to be married. His Honor
gazed thoughtfully for a space, as if uncertain
whether to give her an extra two years for think-
ing of getting married, then asked if the “young
man ” was anywhere on the premises. He was.
.stepped into the box and said that he was
willing and anxious to marry the girl at once if the
law would only refrain from locking her up in a
cold blank apartment, and added that he loved
her just as much as he did before she fell a victim
to the fascinations of a fur jacket. His Honor
pondered things for an hour or so—and incident-
ally sentenced three other offenders to 14 years.
Then he let the girl go until September Ist, when,
if she be not already married, he will pass
sentence. If she is married she will not be
dragged from her happy home to hear any more
remarks about the fur jacket. After which Judge
Eagleson, doubtless with a pleasant glow in his
heart, distributed one or two floggings and some
immense periods of “ solitary.”

About some old lands and landowners :
One of the oldest grants in New South Wales is in the
market—the Baby estate of 3296 acres, on the Cow-
pasture-road, at the corner of Bringelly-road, a grant to
Alexander Biley, who was secretary to Colonel Paterson
when acting-Governor during the mutiny against Bligh.
Originally it was 3000, but “ errors in survey,” always on
the right side, brought it up to 3296 acres. Biley had
two sisters married to officers in the N.S. Wales corps
Balph Wilson and Anthony Fenn Kemp. Their success
at Botany Bay induced the brother to beg an appoint-
ment from Lord Hobart. He arrived in the ship Experi-
ment in 1804 with an order for a land grant of at least
150 acres. His first billet was in Van Diemen’s Land,
where he became a favorite of Colonel Paterson, and
when Paterson stole the acting-Governorship he brought
Biley with him. In the neighborhood of Baby in the
early days were settled the Chisholms (Gledswood) and
the Moores (Catherine Fields). Wm. Cordeaux had
Leppington ; Molle’s Main was a grant to Colonel Molle
and at one time occupied by Howell, the explorer. Not
far away was Kirkham, the home of John Oxley
surveyor-general and explorer. Harrington, Under-Sec-
retary, and son-in-law of Colonial-Secretary Alexander
Macleay, had Elderslie. Narellan was the property of
Francis Mowatt, and Glenlee of William Howe. The
Hassalls had a, big slice of territory in the locality. Baby
has the credit of being the spot where Donoghoe the
bushranger, was shot by the soldiers in the early thirties
The wife of Alexander Biley, in 1822, purchased 100 acres
of John Palmer’s Woolloomooloo estate for £2290. For
annexing land the present land agent was never in it
with our old Australian nobility.

R. K. Lemon, sec. of the Vic, Liquor
Trades Defence Association (the Lemon in the
whisky, so to speak), told a Melbourne meeting
the other night that “the prohibition State of
Maine has the largest proportion of suicides in the
United States,” Yankee statistics are bad things
to swear by, anyhow, but in this case the figures
may be quoted to suggest that sobriety brings
remorse to the converted “drunks” in Maine,
therefore they kill themselves. In nny other
State the liquor would kill them.
REVENGE.
MRS. PECK: “ Binks is married, I see."
MR. PECK : “Glad to hear it. I always hated
him.”
The case of Moses Cohen and his daughter
Rebecca, who were stopped at Auckland when
getting away, so it is alleged, with most of the
assets, but with none of the liabilities, of their
Sydney second-hand clo’ emporium, has some
points of interest. One of them is that drafts for
£6OO were found in Rebecca Cohen’s singlet.
Another is the unobtrusive frankness of Solomon
Cohen, who was left behind in Sydney, A third
is that Auckland is a beastly place, and that Aus-
tralia badly wants a line of steamships which
won’t call anywhere between Sydney and Val-
paraiso, so that people who are going away for a
change won’t be delayed by cablegram in a slushy
little city, situated on top of a foolish old batch of
volcanoes that are of no use to man or beast.
“Alba”: Have
been trying to locate
Sydney’s palest and

Among the factory-
hands I found a cer-
tain cheerfulness, and,
despite the absence of
sun-tan, a tendency to
ruddiness. Drapers
and warehousemen are
I a mixed lot, sallows

corpses ; the youth —*

pinks. For all-round
pallor, the Dago
oyster - opener and
fishshop-man leads the

prawns, probably. The
mailboat- stewards
beat the average
arsenic-eater for sheer
pallor. The steward
is a late-hour man;
his skin grows damp
and he falls asleep
among the sodas and
lemonades, waiting
for the last saloon
passenger to finish his
drink. The reddest
men are the butchers.
Asked one of them
how much bullock he
ate for breakfast.
“Meat!” he shouted,
“I never touch it.
Fish is my dart ;
plenty of it.’’ He
pointed to a Glebe
Island waggon-driver.
“ Look at his hair,”
he said. I looked,
and it was shining
with meat fat.
‘ ‘ Watch how he sticks
his head in the carcase
when he carries one
in. They slam it about
like dog-flesh. Eat
it! Ugh!” I rushed
back to the pale Dago,
and asked him to
name his particular joint. “Feesh, I eata no
dam feesh. I lika the bif-stek,” he said. Writer
attributes the Dago pallor to late hours and
having to prevent the last Fatman from throwing
the oyster-shells under the table.

Among the bequests of a recently deceased
wealthy citizen is one to the petitioner in a society
divorce suit of not so long ago. This lady married
a well-to-do man in defiance of family orders, and
her relations formally renounced her acquaintance.
The husband turning out worse than even his
wife’s kindest enemies had hoped, she was taken
back to the family bosom. Later the well-to-do
gentleman’s vagaries became more remarkable
still, and the harassed wife took steps towards
Justice Simpson. Her family was horrified at the
idea of a public scandal, and again threatened to
cut her off on the usual shilling basis, unless
divorce proceedings were stopped ; but a distant
relation —the wealthy citizen who is now dead—
offered to provide for her if the “ bob ” eventuated,
and on this condition she went on with her case
and won it. Her backer was as good as his word
during his life, and at his death left her £30,000.
* * * *
A recent Melbourne divorce case was a
weighty lesson in the art of love. The husband,
a bank clerk, was 27 when he married a girlie of
17. She was disappointed because his salary did
not permit him to keep a servant, but they got
along more or less lovingly for six months. Then,
being in a hurry, he rushed off to the bank one
morning without giving the little wife her morning
kiss, though he sang out “ Good-bye.” When he
reached home at night he found her gone home to
her mother, and a note pinned to the mirror in-
formed him that “ We have not managed to make
a success of our married life. ... The way you left
me this morning shows how much you care for
me. —Ethel.” She steadily refused to return,
and afterwards went “housekeeping” with a
gentleman in Adelaide. So the bank clerk got
his decree nisi. Probably half the failures in
marriage are due to the first omission of that
morning kiss. Also the evening and other-time
kisses should not be neglected.

“F.C.” : Melbourne Age perpetuates an
error in reporting the recent death of Mrs. Isabella
Bacchus, daughter-in-law of an old pioneer “after
whom Bacchus Marsh was named. It was Sturt,
the explorer, who gave the places thereabouts
their names, and he took them from ancient his-
tory and mythology. “The Marsh” he named
after the old, joyous, beery god ; Mt. Alexander
and Mt. Macedon after the Greek warrior and the
land of his birth ; also the Campaspe River after
Alexander’s favorite lady of loose character.

King Edward has been graciously pleased

OVERCROWDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Councillor Husband, of Nunawading (Vic.), said that at
Sorrento, in the season, as many as 25 girls were stowed
away in a small four-roomed house.
I ask no palaces from Fate,
No marble halls nor gilden portals ;
All Heaven’s bliss I abdicate
For that obtained from plump young mortals ;
I ask, in place of stretching lands,
Where purse-proud magnates oft their rent owe,
Just five and twenty maidens and
A four-roomed cottage at Sorrento.
No sport on earth gives half the fun
Presented by some damsel lively ;
And, if I’ve such a time with one,
How would it thrill me twenty-lively ?
These theologians all were wrong—
Surely deserving souls are sent to
The heaven of that girly throng,
Down in their cottage at Sorrento^
I fain would seek that sunn}' spot,
And you—my rosy quarter-hundred—
Would it not ease your lonely lot
If leagues between us now were sundered ?
Give it your thoughts, my twenty-five,
Though possibly you were not meant to—
To find me room can’t you contrive,
Down in your cottage at Sorrento ?

“E.” writes on the encouragement of
Art:—
A sassiety dame (to wit, Lady Jane Bark) once won
a picture in an art union. It was by Sheeton. The art-
loving Lady Snooks made merry over it, and the con-
noisseur, Sir Bill Bile Beans, said it should be removed to
the lumber room. There the gilded youth, little Willie
and little Eva, played puff and dart at it, and perforated
the magpies that Sheeton had painted. “ Oh, it keeps
them out of mischief,” remarked somebody.
An energetic person has been running a
Bruce auction in Melbourne Eastern Market
recently, and drawing like a circus. The
police tried to suppress him as a public
humbug, the conductor of a lottery, ora
gambling agency, but he doesn’t infringe
“ law ’n’ order,” and he continues to be
mobbed for dockets. The other night a
lucky purchaser drew a large gilt clock
with a glass dome for his shilling.
“ Hold it up, sir, and let the people see
what I am giving for a shilling,” cried
the boss of the auction, and the
proud possessor held his clock
up for about a minute. The
man who holds his hands up
in a Paddy’s Market crowd on
Saturday night ought to know
what will follow. While the
clock was being elevated the
profession went clean through
the winner, taking watch,
money, scarf-pin, and every-
thing shiftable, including even
his tobacco knife. He was
lucky not to lose his trousers.
The newer generation of Mel-
bourne pickpockets always
muster thickly in places where
the excitable citizen is likely to
hold his hands up. Football
crowds are excellent material
to work on. The specialists,
running in threes, pick out an agitated
man who looks worth it, and while he is
“ whoopin’ ’em up,” and howling to South or ’Roy
to buck in, his paws flourish wildly in the air. The
mates of the pocket-miner on either side of him
flourish their paws also to keep up the excitement,
and when the victim and the two conspirators have
finished waving and flourishing there is nothing
left to steal.

“ Melb.” : I have just been listening with
much profit to A. J. Campbell’s lecture on the
Yarra—from source to mouth. The source, how-
ever, is not yet finally determined. The Victorian
Geological Survey is about to announce this
dubiety in a report, after a lot of arduous struggling
with that savage region. As far back as 1845,
Walpole and Thomas thought they had reached
the source. Hoddle was looking for it, too, the
same year. Thwaites, the Melbourne sewerage
engineer, has a mighty scheme for a lake between
Ivanhoe and Northcote.

YOUNG MAN : “ Er—er—er—I've called to ask
for one of your daughters.”
RETIRED DRAPER (absently): “Urn I yes, very
good line—very good line indeed. How many
shall I wrap up? Can I send 'em, or will
you take 'em with you!"
“ O’Fipp ” : For some years a white barber
has battled along in the cosmopolitan quarter of
Melbourne, displaying a placard to the effect that
his business has no connection with the adjoining
shops of Chows, Bashi-Bazouks, etc., who gradu-
ally ousted his white neighbors. Passed the place
recently, and noticed that the piebald alien had
at last slopped over into the barber’s shop. The
street now shows an unbroken line of names like
Gunga Dass, Muley Sassin, Abou ben Bullswull,
Ah Slink, and Yoshishima, without one plain
“John Smith” to rest the eyes on. But Smith
fought a good fight.
THE RIVALS.
NAT HIGGINS (with cigarette): “Cigarettes like
these ain't for kids.”
SPOTTY DODD (with dignity): “See yer after
I've had me shave, Nat.”
“ H.” : The oldest existing Melbourne
hotels seem to be the Crown, on the corner of
Queen and Lonsdale streets, and the Punt Inn, on
the Saltwater River, opposite the racecourse.
Both were erected in 1845.

The drummer returned
after a highly successful
tour of the country dis-
tricts, and the firm’s
manager invited him to
the suburbs for a smoke
and a chat about the
state of the country.
“I got off twelve of
our special lines,” said
the drummer, proudly.
“ The woollen shirts
'< were a catch
line, and scored
every time.” “And
hardly a thread of
wool in them, ”
said the manager,
complacently. “ I
had some doubts
about putting them on
the market, they were
so transparent an imita-
tion; but I risked it.” “I
pushed them specially,” said the
drummer, confidently. “If a thing’s made up
to catch the eye and is boldly pushed it’s sure
to go. It was a good idea to label them ‘ All
Wool.’” That night the manager delivered a
fervid political speech, in the course of which
he said that what was wanted in the public life
of the country was straight and honest dealing
among all sections of the community, from the
highest to the lowest.

The big proputty owners of the Kew
(Melb.) district are asking Premier Bent to sell
the local lunatic asylum reserve, and build a more
up-to-date establishment away in the country.
Bent’s petitioners, of course, are working for their
own suburban interests, rather than the good of
the lunatics; but the proposal is reasonable
enough, and it is now being discussed in the
hope that the Government can make a pro-
fit by adopting it. The late Duncan Gillies, in
the Melbourne boom-time, imagined a sale of
the Kew Asylum estate for a million pounds
sterling, and added that amount to his “paper”
surplus for spending purposes. There was then
no question raised as to what would be done with
the residents on the estate. Gillies credited the
treasury with £1,000,000 from the visionary sale of
Kew Asylum, as though all the inmates were
about to perish, and no more lunatics would be
cast on the Government’s hand. Such incapables
as Gillies are rare, however, and the present
Government has contrived to remember that it
must build a new lunatic asylum before it “blews”
the old one.
The Gippsland town of Sale is just now
getting some surprising and unpleasant informa-
tion on the habits and customs of bores. A few
weeks back it borrowed a drill and plant from the
Mines Department, and started to put down a
bore to get water enough to fill, for ornamental
purposes, a local depression known as Lake Guth-
ridge. It has most assuredly got the water. A
10-inch bore was put down through 65ft. sandy
clay, 34ft. plaster clay, 31ft. sandy clay, 59ft. sand
and lignite, and 71ft. sand with brown coal.
Then the water rose, and it is now
running at the rate of two million gal-
lons a day. Also it is violently
throwing up tons upon tons of sand,
lignite, and brown coal—one lump of
coal recently shot at the town was
nine inches in diameter. Not only
has this debris choked the town
gutters so that gangs have
had to be put on to clear
them and avoid a flood, but
a large vacancy is being
created somewhere under-
neath, and there is a
danger of 300 ft. of piping
and a valuable plant
slipping down to the gates
of Erebus. Also, the local
baths and the huge water
tower that supplies the
township adjoin the scene
of operations, and if the
bowels of the earth con-
tinue to be forced up so
lavishly, these may also
disappear into a great
orifice. In fact, the whole
town is in more or less
danger of subsiding. Fur-
thermore, the water is
charged with sulphuretted
hydrogen, which is a gas
that smells worse than
death.
The tangled story of “ G.H.” :
Witnessed an impressive function in a Melbourne hotel
the other night. An election of committee-men for the
Melbourne Hospital had been held the same day, and the
Argus had gently insinuated that some of the retiring
members should be shifted, and that 20 years’ service was
a fair deal. The returns were made known about nine
o’clock, and almost all the Argus candidates were beaten.
Then a little group of returned committee-men repaired
to a pubbery, to offer up liquid thanks. Somebody made
a long speech, recounting all the noble deeds of somebody
else, who returned thanks, and spoke severely of the
Argus, which had dared to insinuate that they were
played out. He then proposed the health of somebody,
and buttered him heavily. Then some alderman told a
story about King O’Malley. Another alderman passed
the butter to yet another returned committee-man, and
proposed his health in many unctuous polysyllables.
Alderman Blank then repeated his story about O’Malley.
The toasted committee-man returned thanks, and stated
that he and his fellows were a band of noble-minded men,
who sacrificed their time and health in order to do good to
the suffering poor. His fellows applauded violently, and
Alderman Blank told his story again about King O’Malley.
Alderman Dash next moved the health of Alderman
Blank, and Alderman Blank was temporarily overcome
with emotion. Finally he returned thanks, and stated
that what Melbourne wanted was a really Conservative
paper, that would denounce every innovation that came
along. He suspected the Argus of being secretly in the
pay of the Trades Hall. He again told his anecdote about
King O’Malley. Another committee-man moved some-
body else’s health, and spoke disparagingly of the Argus.
Somebody else responded, and agreed with Alderman
Blank re the need for a properly Tory paper. He had
long suspected the Argus of being the accredited organ of
the Labor Party. A Flinders Lane man supported the
motion in favor of a really retrogressive paper, and said
that the Lane men would heartily support such a publica-
tion. He concluded by proposing the health of Alderman
Dash. Alderman Dash was about to reply when Alderman
Blank insisted on repeating his story about O’Malley.
Then Alderman Dash was pressed to tell his story about
the waiter and the stomach-pump. A lot more healths
were drunk, and everybody said that he loved everybody
else like a brother.

An extract from the Dampier Despatch,
a type-written paper of one sheet, issued at
Broome (Westralia): —
“Britisher” writes: Another regrettable incident in
the mayoral career of Mr. William Lowes occurred on
Wednesday evening. At the close of the Assembly ball,
while Mr. Doyle played the National Anthem, and all
loyal men and'true stood in quiet respect for the time-
honored hymn, his Worship was bounding about the
floor, waltzing with a partner who is young enough to
learn many things later on. I have seen blood shed for a
less glaring offence in the same direction. What Bill
Lowes, publican, of this town, does is fortunately no
concern of mine ; but when his Worship the Mayor so
offends against decency and loyal sentiment, I feel that
as a ratepayer (and a heavy one) I have every right to
enter my protest, and request the Council to call upon its
chairman for his apology or his resignation.
When Britishers and people like that stand up
and expose their heads to the glare of the kerosene
lamp on hearing “ God save the King,” it would
be interesting to know if they do it on account of
God or on account of Edward VII. As they
mostly take no notice when God alone is men-
tioned, the assumption seems to be that the Deity
doesn’t matter, and that all the fuss is about
Edward VII.
* * * *
The other night, the Dunedin (M.L.)
Cremation Society sent along a deputation of its
best men to the City Council, and for some
minutes that well-to-do and uncertain body
listened to a fearful lot of common-sense. It is
likely that something may be done, since in Dun-
edin even the City Council does not spend all its
energies in talk; so strenuous Maoriland may
give Australia a strong lead in a big matter. The
problem of disease will never be solved while
graveyards ooze forth the reek and vapor of putrid
flesh and corrupted bone to the four winds.
Apart, however, from all such general considera-
tions, it’s up to Dunedin to take steps, for all the
virulent micro-organisms flourish to swift increase
in that fat Otago soil. Moreover, Dunedin has
set its cemetery on a hill, and the rain rains there
like a sodden devil, and the deluge soaks through
the graves and carries the occupants by imper-
ceptible instalments through the city.
“ Hypo ” : It has generally been held that
tor a person to work on, in a case of urgent neces-
sity, after receiving injuries, is meritorious. Vic-
torian Railway Commissioner Tait doesn’t agree
with that belief. A case recently came under my
notice of a railway man, who was injured on duty
at a small country station. He was alone, and
the position necessitated his remaining at his post
until relieved. In his subsequent report, he ad--
mitted that he had remained on duty for two
hours after receiving his injuries. That was fatal.
His accident-pay was not allowed, “as he had
worked for two hours after being hurt.” Yet the
accident was a bad one, and the man was for seven
weeks with his injured arm in plaster of Paris.
In view of this case, the next injured signalman
or other official will probably go away and let
trains smash up. Evidently that is the way to
save his accident pay.

“Homo” : It has been explained to me
how the Japs have been enabled to employ, in
their turning and enveloping operations, many
thousands more men than are supposed to be in
their whole force. I came across a Melbourne
jingo Chow the other day, who banzaied, and
informed me that “ Plenty Chinamen cuttem off
pigtail, makem look alia same Japanese, go
fightem Lushan.” But would the Chinaman
sacrifice his beloved caudal ornament even for the
joy of going out in the snow and the black
Manchurian slush, and throwing his chop sticks
at Muscovy ?
ACCORDING TO HIS FOLLY.
H IM: “ I’m sure I’ve met you before .”
H ER: “ Very likely. I used to be a nurse at the
gaol hospital.”
The yarn of the surgeon who fastened up
his patient without taking his instruments out of
his patient’s inside needn’t any longer be scoffed
at as a myth. Perhaps it never was a myth, but
it passed for that, as nobody ever mentioned the
surgeon’s name, or shook the patient and let him
rattle as a guarantee of good faith. Paris Cor-
rectional Chamber has just fined a Dr. Vert £2
for forgetting to pick out his tools. Forty shillings
—it’s little enough to encourage other surgeons to
forget things wholesale if it weren’t for the value
of the lost tools.

WOULD THAT
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I read, once in an idle hour,
Some lines about a maiden’s hair,
That clustered richly, fold on fold,
Above a brow serenely fair ;
And when the sunlight lingered there
It turned its dun to gold.
Would that a like transmuting power
Might work its charm for me some day—
When bills crowd in, and friends are cold —
Might flood my room with mellow ray,
And, drifting all the clouds away,
Turn every dun to gold.

FLOWERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Day-Child in the East was born
And, at his natal hour,
He plucked from starry meads of morn
The sun, a saffron flower.
He wore it on his beating- breast,
But, faint with mounting high,
He dropped it from the noon’s blue crest
Far down the shining sky.
The great bloom greyed, yet none might grieve,
For Night, with proud despair,
Took up the ashen rose of eve
And twined it in her hair.
GEO. C. WHITNEY.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
►Sydney, August 15, 1905.
My Dear Arini.—
The new millinery and its awful price are topics
over which Sydney women are not yawning these
days. Inspection of shop windows, and the wire-
hat rests upstairs (on which the toques 101 l like a
stout woman doubled up and asleep in a railway
carriage), and the women on the block, fail to
show the pill-box type of hat threatened by
fashion-writers. I have not seen, so far, a hat
smaller than the crown of the average head. Hats
in shop-windows are turned so as to exhibit
their backs to you. The front is of little
account, and if you endeavor to see it you
will stretch your neck and behave like a goose
looking into a bottle, then bend sideways and
wriggle until the loafers on the pavement think
you an acute case of colic. Most of the trimming
is at the back—flowers, fruit, leaves and ribbons
massed, not to say crammed. So as to get as
much as possible on to the back, the toque has a
steep wide bank, and the horticultural display is
large and varied. Some of the three to six
guinea “pretties” are so perishable that after one
day of hot sun and dust their glory will
be like that of the flowers of yester-year. A
biggish flat straw hat, covered with trails of smilax
and dabs of moss—l think it was moss—gave me a
here-in-cool-grot sensation. Another snood was
garlanded with what looked like sprays of our
Xmas bush in flower, which reminds me how out
of joint (or precocious) is our season. Mr. George
Rignold comes up from his lair in Middle Harbor
wearing in his buttonhole sprigs of the Xmas
flower. And the fruit trees all along the North
Shore line were in bloom a month ago.
Latest things in Stockings shown in a very swell
Pitt-street shop will make you blink. Big checks
of black and white, like shepherd’s plaid, and
others in tiger tones. .Reminds me of William
Morris’s exclamation when he saw the Burne-
Jones’s new rosewood piano. “Striped like a
tom-cat, by Jove.”
It is a very bilious-looking Panther that swings
at anchor in Farm Cove with the Austrian
colors flying from her top sticks. He is a sage-
green man-o’-war, and some of his crew are the
finest-looking men (excepting certain natives of the
Hawkesbury and some Riverina boundary riders)
I have ever seen in Sydney Six-feet-sixers are
some of them, And one of the officers is a Prince
of the Hohenlofie house. His full surname has
34 letters and two hyphens. When Consul
Freehill happened along to stroke the Panther he
was, given a salute of nine guns. To put on a
uniform, and some medals, and run aboard a war-
ship and be deafened by blank cartridge must be
quite a bright feature in the lives qf the profes-
sional gentlemen who act consul. Mr. Freehill,
it may be mentioned, is Consul for Spain, and
the Queen Dowager of Spain belongs to where the
Panther comes from.
Consuls who go out to visit foreign warships
must fly the flag qf their country if they wish for
the salute. A cute waterman has therefore built
a neat little pinnace with a flagstaff specially for
consular use, and charges a good fee for it. One
consuLar gentleman didn’t fqel inclined to pay the
fee, and yet hankered after the salute. He hired
an ordinary row boat, and stood up in the stern
personally flapping the flag of his country. Until
some consul thinks of painting the flag on his
back and swimming, that will hold the record
for economy.
American Consul Orlando Baker has returned
after his trip to the home of his youth in lowa
and the haunts where he catapulted bluebirds and
snared minks as a boy. He renewed old friend-
ships, and showed the lowans lantern-slides of our
great natural resources. Also, I’m sorry to notice,
he spread around some decayed-fish yarns. With
the Consul has returned his daughter by his first
wife, Professor Johanna Baker, who fills a fright-
fully High Chair in Simpson College. She
climbed into it when her father vacated it.
It is the chair of Greek roots, I believe;
people appear to be always digging roots
out of Greece, and that barren, shadeless country
doesn’t seem to get a show. Miss Baker is just in
time to hear Prof. Tucker’s closing lectures on
life in ancient Athens—-its cooking, its kitchen
utensils, its back yard, the old Greek washing
day, and all the other interesting details. The
two American eaglets that the Consul took back
with him for education are his stepsons.
.Talking some more of consuls : Colonel Bell is
surely in training for something as.Japanesy and
as high as Fuji Yama. He has come back from
his travels cultivating an inscrutable smile and the
company of the Japanese Consulate. Also, he
has been pouring the best melted butter over the
new Power in his lecture “Japan As It Struck
Me.” More or less fortunately Japan hasn’t
struck Brigadier Bell yet. When it does, that
grandiloquent Bombadier may feel a little differ-
ently. What a pity someone doesn’t lecture on
“Japan As I Smote It” or “Asia’s Impressions
of Me ! ”
A daughter of that doughty Christian, Bishop
Julius, js going to marry the Rev. Hansell, Yicar
of Karori (M.L.). It was through desiring to be
married by Bishop Julius that fair Maud Jeffries
came to be wedded in M. L. At least, it was her
husband’s wish. The bishop is an old friend of
the Osbornes. But the prelate had gone on a
journey, or something untoward intervened, so
the ceremony occurred at the dozy little township
of Petone.
“ Courage consists in doing the thing of which
you are infernally afraid.” Some British officer
said that, and the quote occurred to me when I
saw the Town Hall filled last night to every foot
of its standing room. The crowd had come to
cheer when the awards for life-saving were made
by the Royal Shipwreck Relief and Humane
Society. One young life-saver in particular
got a terrific din of appreciation all to himself,.
Last January Mr. Eustace Pinhey, a young
dentist, saved the lives of Mr. Rodd (of Batt,
Rodd and Purves) and Mrs. Rodd. Latter were
drowning in deep water amid a strong current at
Cronulla Beach when the athletic Eustace
breasted the breakers and, after two attempts,
brought Mrs. Rodd to safety. Then he swam
back for her husband. Air. Pinhey is a
nephew of Miss Maud Fitzstubbs.' He got
the silver medal. I was rejoiced to see
skipper Schofield, and. fireman Corcoran of
the Mosman boat “Kuinulla,” medalled and
certificated. I chanced to be one of a group
of squealing spectators who watched them
jump overboard in the middle of the trip on
a dark cold night to save a youth who had fallen
into the briny deep. The cause of the trouble
couldn’t swim worth a flap and his choking cries
—ugh ! Schofield had a swim of forty yards or so
to his quarry and was then gripped by the latter
and dragged under. Fireman Corcoran went out
with the life line—and some minutes later “first
aid ” was mighty necessary.
We must be on our guard against an honor
called the Victorian Medal, which King Edward
has included in his Birthday decorations. His
chef was adorned with one last Birthday. Awful
if Mr. Deakin or Mr. Reid, in the coil of things,
got so decorated, and found themselves in the
same nobility with a cook !
Miss Daisy Davis, the pretty Sydney girl who
was playing in one of Mr. Geo. Musgrove’s com
panics, and who is now doing Marjorie, in “ The
Country Girl,” around the English provinces,
returns shortly to be married to a relative of the
Dibbs family. Also, Miss Davis’s brother marries,
this month, Mrs. J amieson, of Marratta station.
So the Davis household is having an epidemic of
matrimony.
For a literary counter-irritant to the “fashion-
able ” novel with its atmosphere of greed and in-
trigue and idleness, and excitement, its “faked”
women and effeminate men, get the “ Memorials
of Edward Burne-Jones,” written by his wife.
Her face is in most of his pictures—she is the
Beggar Maid in tbe Cophetua picture and the
Briar Rose series, The Burne-Joneses started
their married life with a capital of about £3O, and
the story (in two volumes) of the expanding house-
hold—its love and hope, its faith and high resolve,
its gentle charity, its cheerfulness, sweet serious-
ness, and artistic and literary atmosphere—makes
fascinating reading in these days when the writers
of “The Fallings Down Stairs of Evangeline”
and “ Porkers in Clover ” would have us believe
that of such rascals alone is the kingdom of Eng-
land.
Concerning the “faked” woman: Marie
Corelli, in “Free Opinions,” says things of
her—and of her male worshippers. The latter,
alleges the writer, are the principal instigators
of the mischief. “For they openly show their
admiration for women’s clothes more than for the
women clothed—they are more easily captured by
art than nature. An unstylish woman may
have the purest nature, the truest heart, and
the sweetest face in the world, but the
‘ dressed ’ woman, the dyed and painted and
artistically ‘ faked ’ woman, will nearly always
score a triumph over her as far as masculine
appreciation is concerned. The ‘ faked ’ woman
has everything on her side. The drama supports
her, the press encourages her,” &c. Which, if
true, goes to prove the mereness of man, who be-
gins to seem very mere indeed.
Mr. Laurance Phillip’s concert will be the
musical circumstance of this month. It takes
place August 24 at Y.M.C.A. hall. Miss Jean
Maclurcan, who has a bird-like soprano, and
Mr. W. Beattie, the tenor favorably remembered
in comic opera work, also the only Sykes (with the
wonderful buttonhole) will assist.
News of Eva Mylott says that the contralto is
crowded with engagements until March.
Mr. Charles Norman, for several years sub-
editor of Sydney Telegraph, is (in conjunc-
tion with Mr. J. Tait) seeing violinist Heermann
through Maoriland. Mr. Norman is lucky in
having two strings to his bow, journalism and
music. Journalism not offering a very promising
field in Australia just now, he goes back to music.
The marriage of Mr. Leonard Dobbin, a Sydney
solicitor, occurs this month in Melbourne. Mr.
Dobbin has the reputation of being the properest
and most trustworthy bachelor in this State, and
it was quite sufficient to tell an ultra-careful
mama that “Leo” was going to the moonlight
picnic, for mama to reply, “ Then Birdie may go
without me.” Leo was a solid and reliable
guarantee. Was there ever a Don Juan who
carried the name of Dobbin !
Commander Lacy, that quiet-looking brown
study who used to order, “ Clear the decks for
action,” and such like, on H.M.S. Mutine, has
been appointed Commander of H.M.S. Emerald,
Boys’ Training Ship, Queenstown, Ireland.
Mrs. M’Laglan, wife of a Major of that name
in the Cameron Highlanders, and daughter of
the late Mr. Henry White, of “Greenoaks,” Dar-
ling Point, is back from S’Africa on a visit to her
mother. Mrs. Laglan’s Major is on the General’s
Staff at Pretoria.
Mr. Willie Watt, one of the steamship people,
is in Sydney again, and the Pointer girls are
assuming an extra fluffiness and practising an
engaging manner. The Watt brothers look like
the young men in the pictures in Ameri-
can magazines—the pictures that advertise
yachting suits, or cocktails, or “ refined ” smokes.
Two of them married Australian beauties, but the
Willie one still runs loose.
The home of the Norfolk Howards “has been
brightened by the advent of a daughter,” as the
American press puts such domestic events. An
infant mewling and puking in her nurse’s arms is
the latest descendant of Jockey of Norfolk whom
the spring poet urged, in his rejected contribution
of 420 years ago, to be not too bold, for Dickon, his
master, was bought and sold. It is a long cry
from the bulky peer who found the poem pinned
to his tent on the last day of his life to little Mary
Rachel, the important baby. And the family has
run to seed somewhat.
Talking of motor cars—the newest and brightest
of black toot machines in Sydney to day is the
motor brougham of Mrs. “Jim” Faiifax. It is
the only specimen of its kind here, and looks like
an elegant mourning coach. When the glass door
opens and the owner, all in black, steps out, the
onlookers feel quite de profundisy. Mrs. G.F.,
sister of Mrs. “ Jim ”, it may be mentioned, is often
pronounced—by men —to be the best dressed
woman in Sydney. Asked one of the pronouneers
why. He cleared his throat deeply and reached
out in the air with his head for suitable
descriptive phrases, and when at a loss for a fitting
adjective he brushed the atmosphere with his
hands. But it amounted to this: “She wears
not more than one or two colors, and her get-up
gives the idea of severity, so simple is it. Not so
much as a hair is out of bounds. Her clear-cut
face is not made up, and she’s so perfectly finished
off in matters of dress detail that one gropes for a
glorified synonym for the word ‘neat’ wherewith
to describe her.” Then he brushed the atmos-
phere again reaching for the synonym.
Someone in the Far North has been sounding
a loud timbrel of warning in the American press
rc white women marrying Orientals
“ A sad lot,” he says, “awaits the white woman who
has the misfortune of being beguiled into marrying a
Japanese. Usually, vvhen abroad, the student (and they
are all students) receives plenty of additional pay, and it
is not much to be wondered at that, in closely settled
countries, like Germany or England, a poor girl, -who
has no prospects of marrying at home, consents to wed
the ‘polished Japanese gentleman.’ If he occupies a
good position at home, and has plenty of money, there
seems to be no hardship involved, except, maybe, in nine
cases out of ten, the antagonism of the Japanese parents ;
but woe to her if it be but a subaltern position with a
subaltern’s pay awaiting them when she accompanies him
to Japan ! ”
Two O’Sullivans were lecturing on one recent
night on two romantic countries. Our own E. W.
O’S. was Demosthenesing on “ Ireland,” and Rev.
Mr. O’S., a missionary, was illuminating our dark-
ness re “Egypt.”
Arthur Adams departed for his native Tussock
Land by the Mokoia, Saturday before last. Same
day, appeared in the Herald his article of two
screams—l mean two columns—in praise of Sydney
and its harbor. If it had appeared in an English
paper it would have been a better advt.,
and perhaps have caused a rush of English capi-
tal to “develop our magnificent natural resources.”
It might have even led to “an influx of money for
investment in opening up the country.” It was
wasted on the local folk. People don’t want to
read two columns about a thing that they see
every day, any more than, a polar bear wants to
read two columns about ice, or a whale, when it
comes down to breakfast, desires to find its morn-
ing paper filled with a lengthy dissertation about
salt water. Such a thing is calculated to make the
animal put its flipper down firmly and stop its
subscription.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent :
“ The Cliveden widow has been out of all the
recent junkets. She timed her rustic Thule jaunt
for the briskest term of the cold season, to every-
one’s astonishment. As a rule, frivollers only
absent themselves from Melbourne in winter when
they’ve been naughty, or had a bother about the
bills, or suffered purse-spasms over bridge. The
widow had none of these—she doesn’t know what
naughtiness means, and she doesn’t plunge at
cards. She must have desired to see the wattle
bursting into gold in the jolly neighborhood of the
Thule acres.
“ The Coronation party, at Government House,
lasted for a very brief spell, and the crimson rope
separating the goats from the pure merinoes played
an important part in the proceedings. Flunkeys
gripped the rope at either side, and spiked officials
in feather trimmings prevented its removal at the
point of the spur. Captain Dangar regulated the
drafting with a jaunty front, but various other
official drovers took the duty as seriously as kelpies.
Lady Northcote, green-clad, had emeralds like a
scattering of starboard lights about her corsage,
and a constellation of stars threw out extraordinary
lights from the mast-head. The bobs executed by
she guests were of several brands. Several pre-
cipitated themselves into a knee-bend beyond their
balancing powers. Lady Talbot looked on at the
performers through an elevated magnifier. Her
warm, wine-tinted toilette didn’t dispel the chill of
her smile. Miss Talbot wore white, and her
blue blood had come to her face at the call of the
cold. Tommy Bent was bidden to the festival,
and he waddled in with an honest, open grin. I
noticed, too, grandmamma Madden in white, her
diamonds alone suggesting that she was not a
debutante.
“Several comic incidents lent relief to the
party. One dodderer, showing calves in long
socks, absent-mindedly gave his cab-number
ticket instead of his card to the Aide. That
official narrowly escaped shouting out the numeral
as the venerable advanced. Mrs. Everard Browne,
full of joy over a returned spouse who had been
gadding for months abroad, tugged at his elbow
to hurry him on to their waiting Exes. Certain
Federal Goliaths in Court frills were a joke. They
perhaps feared rheumatic twinges, and therefore
double-barrelled their limbs by introducing woollen
wear under the silk stockings of Court dress. The
effect was that of a clumsy attempt at padding.
“ Mrs. Harry Payne, usually, one of the most
luminous of diamond dames, lumined not at all at
the Coronation party. Her recently stolen gems
had not been replaced, so the lady glittered none.
Avexed question here is : Where did Mrs. Payne
hide her gems ? The robbery reports didn’t reveal
the hiding-place. Was it an old stocking, a bath-
slipper, the clothes-basket, or the mattress ? It
wasn’t a safe. Stern secrecy is maintained as to
the hiding-place scented out by Bill Sykes and co.
“ The absence of the Reidites from Lord North-
cote’s Coronation party was noted by all the
Y.R. officials and commented on with many a
grin. Not a single member of the last Ministry
was there. Yes-No shouldn’t take on so ; he really
shouldn’t.
“ The death of jovial Harry Osborne, sport
champion and all-round good fellow, was a shock
to a big squatter clan. A Melbourne Grammar
School boy, he went away to collect degrees at
Cambridge, He didn’t use those degrees any, but
poloed and hunted seasons away. Tuberculosis
set in suddenly and proved fatal. Another
Osborne, Jim, nursed him patiently to the end.
“ The engagement of Miss Frankie Oliver and
Mr. Stuart Murray was announced at a Harper
spree on Wednesday night. This is quite the
thing now. A shivoo is given to a newly-pledged
couple, and their matrimonial intentions are pub-
lished by the host for the rejoicing of all the
guests. The present pair are more popular than
most of the linking couples hereabouts. Miss
Oliver (whom everyone calls Frankie) is a most
captivating dasher. The youth starring with her
this time has good looks and a large income from
a Western estate where fat kine abound. He’s
considered fortunate by all Melbourne johnnie-
dom.
“Mr. James Macdonald Buchanan, third son
of the late Baronet Leith Buchanan, of Ross
Priory, marries Miss Queenie Porter —a St. Kilda
charmer—early in September. The bride to-be is
the second daughter of Dives Porter, the landlord
of Her Majesty’s Theatre. She’s a tall, languid
trailer, but the Englishman towers a head above
her.
“ A law suit starts presently in a prominent
Melbourne family over the question of a deceased
daughter’s property. The daughter was married,
and the widower claims his share. Hence the
friction. Of course, lawyers will profit the most
by the action.
“Talking of widowers! One, whose wife died
after the briefest spell of matrimony, immediately
packed up the brand-new presents and carted
them off to the auction room. The donors of the
cruets and the clocks set up a howl of complain-
ings, but the souvenirs were brutally sold, and
.the grieving widower went off to spend the pro-
ceeds on a consolation jaunt. Of course, he came
back with a comforter. But he had to buy his
second crop of salt-cellars and pickle-jars himself.
“ Portraits of Mrs. Kelly (Miss Knight-Mollison)
and infant are all over the Melbourne papers and
the Toorak grand pianos. An ex-actress regards
a little arrival in the family as an uncommon
achievement, something rare, heroic, awe-in-
spiring. Mrs. Norman Menzies (Miss Dolly
Vane) joyed and marvelled just the same.
“ A recent moralising reference in this letter to
ail unnamed matron and * the difficulties of her
sundered state ’ seems to have provided congenial
sport for some of the choicest society cats,
especially the Queen tabby of the tribe. With
one accord they professed to discover the subject
of reference in a lady for whom it was not intended.
The fact that her name has not been ‘dropped out
of Government House lists ’ should have secured
her against the spiteful innuendoes, but any shadow
of an excuse to torment a pretty and clever woman
in delicate health is good enough for cats to jump
at. The victim in this case has the satisfaction of
knowing that her ‘ friends ’ have not fallen away
from her. Not content with taking the liveliest
interest in everything which concerns her, they
insist on making her the heroine of a paragraph
that didn’t apply to her at all.
“ There’s material for a Byronic sonnet in a bon-
fire of ball programmes. A Girl of the Past, who
has not outlived her sense of humor, lately invited
her Woman friends —the married and the hoping-
to-be —to a muffin and bonfire occasion. She had
over a hundred programmes with pencils still
dangling. She spread them out ruefully and in
order. The company, immensely tickled at first,
became fascinated at the story revealed. First
the crowded initials of the debutante period.
Every dance booked. Extras signed for. The re-
currence in later ones of certain initials. A dozen
showing a constant repetition of these. Two or
three lots struggling for top place. Then a thin-
ning down of names. Later arid spaces. Finally
a blank card. The faded fairy made a big effort
over a sob, and plunged the lot with a laugh into
the stove.
“The cabbage rose as a hair ornament should
be banished. Banged down on the thatch, it is
incongruous as a hen brooding on a nest of
nettles. A La France rose, pinned lightly to the
top coil, sometimes looks as if it had happened
there from the parent stem. And all the smaller
blossoms garland naturally enough over brown
coils, but the Yank rose of the giant petals is an
aesthetic sacrilege. The Gibson girl wears it suc-
cessfully—in her pictures—but the Melbourne
charmer who isn’t Gibson, and who emulates her
sort by an abnormal thatch arrangement and an
unusual size in vegetables, misses the ’bus every
time. The brilliant wings, of recent arrival in
toney shops, are the best furnishings to a fashion-
able thatch.

IN A DEADLY DECLINE.
Saved Just in Time by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills*
“ fTIHREE years before my marriage I was
I just on the edge of the grave,” said Mrs.
JL Wm. Hicks, N. Ryde, near Sydney, who
was interviewed last week when paying
a short visit to her parents in Newcastle. “I
started to ail soon after I turned 15, and I didn’t
expect to see another birthday. I kept failing
until Nurse Oughton made me take Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills. She said they would save my life —
and they did. The first box made me as hungry
as a hawk. In a few weeks, both father and
mother said I was plainly getting better, for you
could hear me talking and laughing all over the
house. Before that, you couldn't g«t a word out
of me. I had hardly the strength to stand, and
looked just like a corpse—but Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills built me up into a fine, strong girl, with any
amount of health and spirits.”
Mrs. Hicks has hundreds of friends in New-
castle who can vouch for the truth of every word
she speaks. Mr. Ford (her father) is Head
Stevedore for Gibbs, Bright and Co., Ltd., and
now resides at “ Flemington,” Denison-street,
Hamilton. His daughter (Mrs. Hicks) owes her life
to the timely advice of Nurse Oughton, who is
held in much esteem by the people of Newcastle
and by her profession. Nurse Oughton has a
Nursing Home in Denison-street, Hamilton,
Newcastle, where she can be consulted profes-
sionally—and anyone who makes inquiry will find
that she endorses every statement made by Mrs.
Hicks. Hundreds of others can tell how this
young woman seemed to be right on the verge of
Consumption before she started taking Dr. Wil-
liams’ Dink Pills for Pale People.
“I grew so fast that my blood began to turn to
water,” Mrs. Hicks went on. “Every scrap of
color left my face. Even my lips and gums were
white. My cheeks fell in, and my cheek-bones
stood out so that I had a ghastly look. But I did
not look any worse than I felt. Words cannot
describe the awful weak feeling that I strove to
beat down day after day. Every few weeks great
dark circles came under my eyes, showing what a
terrible state my health was in. There was so
little blood in my body that I could never get my
hands and feet warm.
“ What little blood I had was bad. Sometimes
the bile seemed to get into my veins, and turned
all my skin a sickly yellow. 1 was always bilious.
The sight of food turned me sick, and I never had
my regular meals. I ate so little that I fell away
to a shadow. Nearly everything turned sour on
my stomach and brought on a bilious attack.
Every now and then a fit of dizziness seized me.
The room would swim round and round, and I had
to stagger to the couch. There I would lie for the
next day or two with a terrible thumping headache.
Often these headaches turned to Neuralgia, and
shot through my temples till I nearly screamed
with the pain. No wonder my nerves broke down.
They were so unstrung that I hardly ever got a
night’s sound sleep. A sudden footstep made me
jump, and left my heart fluttering for an hour.
Often I was afraid that 1 might drop dead with it.
“Nurse Oughton got so alirmed that she made
mother get a supply of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
from Blackall & Hunt, the chemists, down in
Hunter St., Newcastle, ’ Mrs. thicks concluded.
“ She said they were tae one thing that could save
rue. To mother’s delight, the first box gave me a
better appetite than I had had for four years.
After that every dose put new strength into me.
I was able to digest whatever I ate, and soon
began to get positively fat. Gradually I developed
as I should have done two or three years before.
At last I was free from all danger of Decline.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills built me up into a strong
young woman —and I have had the best of health
ever since.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cure bloodlessness just
as surely as food cures hunger. That is how they
cured Mrs. Hicks’s Decline.' A pale anaemic per-
son needs one thing only —new blood. Dr.
Williams’ -Pink Pills do one thing only—they
make new blood. That is all they do, but they do
it well. They don’t act on the bowels. They
don’t bother with mere symptoms. They won’t
cure any disease that isn’t caused originally by
bad blood. But when Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
re-place bad with good blood they strike at the
root and cause of all common diseases like head-
aches, sideaches, backaches, kidney trouble, liver
complaint, biliousness, indigestion, anaemia, neu-
ralgia, sciatica, locomotor ataxia, and the special
secret troubles that every woman~knows but none
of them like to talk about, even to their doctors.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by retailers and
the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney—2s. 9d. a
box, or six boxes 15s. 3d., post free.

“Jack” Scantlebury, the ex- Australian
mining journalist, has joined Mennell in the
ownership and control of the British Austral-
asian, in London.
Joseph Chamberlain, when talk of Aus-
tralia crops up in his house in Birmingham, shows
a picture representing an Australian bush fire,
and tells how a certain W. N. Willis presented it
to him through Agent-General Copeland.
J. C, Watson has been in rather poor
health lately, the hard and anxious work of the
year affecting his nerves. He proposes to take a
brief spell, and, during his absence, Fisher (Q.)
will act as leader of the Labor party.
Pioneer Baptist minister Kingsford, who
passed out at Brisbane lately, aged 87, married his
second wife, Miss Grimes, only three weeks before
his death. He fed the flock at Jireh Church for
37 years, and had lived in Brisbane since 1860.
There died recently at North Sydney, at
the age of 80 years, an active business woman,
who, though living in one shop for 20 years, had
never crossed the road in front of her establish-
ment, and was never in a neighbor’s house all that
time.
Veteran journalist “Bobby” Byrne, of
Queensland Figaro, had an unusual operation
performed on him lately. After suffering years
of agony through facial neuralgia, the old man
had the nerve cut out, and is now bat-
tling along as of yore.
Brisbane’s hangman enjoys his ease (’twixt
hangings) in a sweet, rosd-embowered cottage on a
grassy knoll, overlooking the scene of his labors.
There, oil a quiet Sunday afternoon, he sits, en-
joying a contemplative pipe, whilst spread out to
his view is the South Brisbane Cemetery, where
his “ patients ” lie.
Politician Crick nowadays is a very angry
man when the Lands scandals are mentioned in
N.S.W. Assembly. The other night he flew off
the handle again, and in three exciting minutes he
called another member an old snufflebuster,
alluded to someone as a puppy, and undertook to
hit a third paity hard on the nose.
Arthur Morgan, Queensland’s Premier, is
getting grey rapidly. When he held the Speaker-
ship there was scarcely a glint of silver in the
raven locks ; but two years of trying to make ends
meet and to answer the verbosities and inanities
of Philp and Leahy are enough to bleach any
man’s hair.
“ Thurla ” writes :
“ Burrowong ” (B. 20/7/’O5), re old Sofala, says R. D.
Meagher’s father was on the gold escort. This is not
correct. He probably means Sergeant Owen Maher, an
old 99th man. Meagher, senior, was a foot constable at
Bathurst in 1863, and in 1866 was promoted to Cowra,
in succession to Constable Sutherland, who was shot by
Grey whilst returning from Bathurst quarter sessions.
HONORARY MINISTER KEATING.
Premier Bent lias been telling a meeting
at Bairnsdale (Vic.) that Charles Jardine Don,
the most distinguished member of the Labor
party in the early 60’s, gave up stonemasonry to
start a cigar shop, in which he made a fortune.
The facts are that Don became licensee of a pub,
speedily lost his health, and died prematurely.
He was a fine speaker, and was known as “the
prose Burns.’’
Ex-schoolmaster Mac Master, who was a
Tasmanian Labor candidate for the Senate at last
elections, but now appears to have been dropped
by the Labor bodies, is editing Hobart’s new four-
page weekly, the Critic. Proprietor is G. Massey,
formerly a partner with editor Woods in the

Keating’s Labor brother, Pierce Keating.
Melbourne Australasian gently chiding a
correspondent: —
“H.S.” (Collingwood). —Cardinal Moran did not stand
for the New South Wales Parliament, but for the Com-
monwealth Parliament at the first Federal elections in 1801.
The Cardinal stood as a candidate for a place
among tlio 10 N.S.W. delegates to the Federal
Convention, and the heavy organ is as badly mixed
as the' correspondent it misinforms.
Sydney barrister Field crops up again in
London over a small railway matter. He was the
centre of a stiffly fought slander action in Sydney in
connection with proceedings in the School of Arts.
Field sued Windeyer, afterwards Judge, for
words alleged to be defamatory. Martin presided,
Owen appeared for Field, Darley for Windeyer,
and the jury gave a verdict for defendant. Field
afterwards took religion in ail acute form, street-
i'reached in Sydney, and won a pious billet in
England, but lost it a while ago.
Chief Justice Stout, of Maoriland, is ageing
over-rapidly, and to-day has much of the irascible
old lady in him. He should be made Matron of
the University or something before he loses his
reputation.
What a relief it would be to a lot of people
if Mr. W. N. Willis would only die and remain
dead ! In the bank troubles of ’93 two big bank
managers did the thing gracefully, and saved a
lot of trouble by dying at an opportune moment.
Apropos, J a globe-trotter swears that he saw, 12
months ago, in Bruges, the portly figure of one of
the deceased. Yet he has been officially dead for
11 years.
Captain Charles, whose 88th birthday was
celebrated last week, was appointed to N.S.W.
Legislative Council just 20 years ago. Like many
shellbacks who take to the land, the captain
has shown creditable activity in the pursuits of
agriculture, dairying and cattle-breeding. He
nurses a number of political theories, most of them
antiquated, but as a politician who believes in the
abolition of borrowing and in public honesty and
solvency he is one of the most up-to-date men in
N.S.W.
A couple of Hindu hawkers, who had
made a pile, and were returning to the black part
of the Empire to vegetate for the rest of their
days, evidenced a quaint species of gratitude to
the country that had enriched them, by attending
Melb. City Police Court one recent morning and
paying the fines of all the drunks. The white
man who acquires a pile mostly takes it all away
to the Cold Country, and shows his gratitude by
lying about the country whence he derived it.
Coneybeer, new Government Whip (S. A.),
has been in Parliament 12 years, and at the recent
elections was returned for Torrens by the largest
number of votes ever registered for an individual
at any election in the State?.-' Coneybeer is
a collar-maker by trade, and formerly followed his
calling in Orange, Sydney and Melbourne. He
came to Adelaide somewhere about 1891, and has
been foremost in Labor circles ever since. For
some time he was secretary to the Labor party.
He is something of a singer, and no smoke social
in his district is quite complete without him.
Douglas Waddell, a N.S.W. bankrupt, has
lain in gaol for four months rather than answer
questions as to what became of certain moneys,
stating that he is bound by a promise which he
holds sacred. Public sympathy gathered round
the young and presentable gentleman who main-
tained the dead silence, and the community was
distinctly disappointed when the prisoner men-
tioned that the person to whom he had pledged
his word was a man with a wife and young chil-
dren. It had made up its mind that the pledge
was given to a tall and noble vision with a wealth
of brown hair that curled naturally.
Two very old Australian names were
found in an obituary notice last week “ Mary
Susan, wife of William Redfern Antill, aged 62
years.” William Redfern was a young surgeon’s
mate, who unwisely gave utterance to his humane
sentiments as to the treatment of the British
men-o’-war who joined in the mutiny at the Nore
in 1797, and he came to Australia for life in con-
sequence, but was afterwards pardoned. He had
as a grant the whole of the land now known by
his name. The first Antill arrived as a captain in
the 73rd Regiment with Governor Macquarie, and
was A.D.C. and private secretary to that Scotch
ruler.
A very old citizen’s beer-factory—the Cas-
tlemaine Brewery, Hay-street, Sydney—is being
pulled down and the site cleared. In 18/0
“Nick” Fitzgerald. M.L.C., of Victoria —John
O’Shanassy’s son-in-law —thinking that Sydney
“tangle” could be improved upon, started a
branch of his Castlemaine Brewery on the site.
He had in partnership a family connection, Mr.
Prendergast, who died recently in Italy. When
the Castlemaine people started Sydney had
nominally three breweries —Tooth’s, Marshall s,
and Henfrey’s, the last being chiefly “soft
tack.” The business existed until the early nine-
ties, when it was discontinued.
Medway Day, who died lately in Tasmania,
did more than one would reckon on from the size
of the “ so-long ” paragraphs he got. When lie
went out of the pulpit and on to the inky way, m S.
Australia, he soon worked up to chief leader-
writer, and was often acting-editor, of the
Register. He nearly dragged that now virulent
Tory print over to Radicalism ; in fact, he did
drag it over for a while. The land-tax idea ran
away with him sometimes; and when the
Register couldn’t hold him any more, he founded
the Voice in Adelaide. But the Voice was never
a paper—it was always a sermon ; and it couldn’t
last. Then he drifted over to Sydney—doing
press work and trying to promote industrial enter-
prises. Undoubtedly he was, while he had a
pulpit in the Register office, one of the principal
forces in S. Australia ; and the Village Settle-
ments, on the Murray and elsewhere, were very
largely of his making. When the frightened
Register turned slowly on its tracks, and cursed
all the things that it had barracked for, it blotted
the one valuable period of its life out of its
memory ; and it now speaks of those settlements as
it does of snakes.
Reginald J. Black, who owns a lot of
Sydney newspaperdom, _ and is now strong
on immigration, had a stirring grandfather,
author of many thrilling tales of the high
seas. Old John Black was on board the
Lady Shaw when two companies of soldiers
mutinied and shot the captain and several
officers. They dropped Black and a few
others in an open boat, and sent them
adrift. The boat struck Brazil, where a
British man-of-war picked the party up.
As it was war*time, Black had a hand in
the capture of several ships, and was given
charge of one of them. In this he reached
the Cape of Good Hope, where he loaded
up with produce for Sydney, arriving at
that port in 1798. Once on Australian soil,
he settled and reared a son to the banking
business, and the son, in his turn, reared
Be iaald, financier, politician, and journalist.
One Melbourne Orange agitator holds
the record for ingenious wriggling out of
his public utterances. Some years ago he
made a speech during a big church row,
being apparently under the impression
that no reporters were present. Next
day, when his remarks appeared in full, he
wrote explaining that the reporter, by
merely taking a mechanical note of his
words and presenting them in cold type,
was not able to give the correct interpreta-
tion understood by those who were sitting
in God’s edifice, imbued with divine fervor
and surrounded by divine atmosphere.
He evidently didn’t think it possible that
the reporter might have been affected by the
divinity of the atmosphere and put the fervor into
his report.
The Mayor of Collingwood (Melbourne)
lately burst into a eulogy of that suburb : —-
Collingwood was a remarkable place—p. city of cham-
pions. It had the champion football team, champion
draughts players, champion quoit throwers, champion
bowlers, champion A.N.A. debaters, and a champion
brass band.
He forgot to mention that the two-up champion
hails from Collingwood, also the champion tote,
Wren’s, is there ; and the late M.L.A. Shiels was
born in Collingwood ; and the champion marrying
parson, Nathaniel Kinsman, told that champion
Premier T. Bent all about Jonah and the whale m
a Collingwood Sunday-school; and the champion
word-whirler, Elijah Dowie, uttered his first
“stinkpot” in a Collingwood Bethel (facing the
rear entrance of Wren’s tote, by the way). Also
the fish-and-chips king and the Napoleon of the
peanut trade hail from Collingwood. It is a great
city, it is.
PROUD OF IT.
“Madam, you see before you a self-made man.
Starting life with a motor-car, a steam yacht,
and two thousand a year, I am now totally
independent of these luxuries, and all entirely
owing to my own genius and unaided enter-
prise.”
N.S.W. Assembly, some while ago, ap-
pointed a Select Committee to inquire into the
ways of money-lenders. One prominent and
venerable member, anxious to make the investi-
gation thorough, called personally on a leading
money-lender and asked about his rates. “ Well,
sir,” said the artful Shylock, recognising his
questioner, “ the rates vary. To a man of good
character and of well-known standing a gentle-
man like yourself, for instance—the rate is five or
six per cent. But when there is more risk, the
rates, ot course ” But here that legislator
broke in eagerly with the remark that he would
take £lO3 at 5 per cent, then and there. The
money-lender, who wouldn’t have lent him five-
pence at 100 per cent, as a matter of business, had
to dodge that legislator for months afterwards,
and regretted his first prompting to put the best
face he could on his calling.
A DESPERADO.
SMOKER HORAN: “Gam! Whatcher givin’ us ?

PINCHER SMITH: “My oath! They know what

Dean Selwyn, whose widow was recently
buried at Newcastle, came to Australia to grow
sheep and cattle and live the life of the pioneer
squatter. He came of a clerical family, and was
only a short time out when he determined to cut
the sheep business and take to the church. New-
castle, Morpeth and Maitland were the scenes of
most of his church labors. His father was an
English canon and his mother the daughter of a
bishop ; he was cousin of Bishop Selwyn of Melan-
esia, and his widow, just deceased, was the
daughter of a clergyman. The Selwyns are long
livers, most of them reaching 80 years and several
getting past the 90th milestone.
“ Spare-me-days ” writes
In re recently deceased W. E. Sparke. W. E. Walford
and W. E. Sparke, first cousins, were both employed by
their uncle, wine and spirit merchant “ Bill ” Long. They
left, and started business in the same line. As biz. did
not rush them at the start, Walford funked, and went back
to Long. Sparke stuck to it, however, and, when success
was assured, Walford again joined him, and they never
looked back. One of their most successful speculations
was a deal in the Ohisholm Estate, George-street, Sydney,
over which they cleared £75,000, after holding the pro-
perty only three weeks. W. E. Sparkeis half-brother,
John Simons, was a big property-holder and well-known
sporting man in Sydney some 40 odd years ago.
Edward J. Sparke, W. E.’s brother, was an adept with
“the gloves”—the George Seale of his day. The
rudiments of the noble art were knocked into him by the
celebrated Black Perry, who was employed by the Sparkes
when they kept the Royal Hotel. “ Ted ” Sparke managed
Gingie Station near Walgett, owned by Walford and
Sparke, until he dropped into a most unexpected windfall.
“ Jack ” Smith, a Sydney owner of racehorses and much
property, who was married to actress Kate Corcoran, was
dying in London and sent for a Sydney solicitor, who
happened then to be in England, to make his will. “I
intend to leave it all to Bill Long,” said Smith. “ Why
Bill Long? ” replied the solicitor. “ Now there’s your old
chum, Ted Sparke, who hasn’t a bean to call his own.”
And Ted Sparke it was to whom Smith left £(>0,000, the
only contingency being a small annuity to his wife, and
as she died before the news of Smith’s decease reached
Sydney Ted Sparke got the fortune unencumbered.
A Westralian pressman writes :
Dr. Hackett, chief boss of the West Australian, a staid
elderly gentleman of 60, has just led to the altar the
youngest of the Brockman girls—not yet 20. The
members of the newspaper staffs gave a silver tea and
coffee service, in acknowledging which the prospective
bridegroom vowed his intention of treasuring it and
handing it down to his family. Whereat there was much
applause and the doctor abruptly concluded. The
“doctor’s” title is purely honorary, but he is immensely
proud of it, and the noble order of the sack awaits any
member of the literary staff who omits it in any mention
of his chief. Hackett is intensely vain, and wears .the
gorgeous raiment of past grand master of various lodges
and tents and huts and other structures in the vast
wilderness on the smallest provocation. He has never been
known to refuse anything in the way of official positions.
Among other things he is at present chairman of Public
Parks Board, Diocesan Registry Board,Ecclesiastical Board,
also Oaves and Rivers, Masonic Benevolent, High School,
Zoological, Library and Museums, Agricultural Advisory,
and a dozen other boards. Also he is M.L.O. The Brock-
mans were among the very earliest settlers and reckon
themselves several cuts abo've the Six Families, whose
immediate ancestors were mostly in the tea and sugar,
calico and blankets, butter and cheese, rum and tobacco
way of business. The only other family considered by the
Brockmans equal to themselves is the Hamerslej s. Big-
john married a Miss Hamersley but the Forrests were
always ignored by the Six Families—Burts, Stones,
Shen'tons, &c.—until money and political influence altered
affairs.

“ J.W.” : Re “ Alec Zander” (B. 27/7/’O5).
The blackboy’s graphic description of the horse’s
fright on seeing the camel recalls a peculiar case of
animal maternal impression (see Gen. xxx., 37-42)
which occurred when I was on Innamincka (S.A.)
in 1878. Teams not being able to travel, the
station supplies were brought from Adelaide per
camel. The result was that, on the arrival of the
odorous ones, the horses (as Tim said) all went
“whisht.” Subsequently a valuable mare had a
foal which was perfect horse in every way except
the head and neck. These parts were camel.
When leaving the station I tried to buy the
monstrosity, but the manager would not sell. I
beard afterwards a showman had it in Queensland.

“ Nulla ” : Strange how few animals have
the sense to turn back when “up against it.”
Sheep looking for feed in the day-time will come
to a fence and stay there, so that during a drought
a corner in a wired paddock is a good place to
steer clear of. Also, on account of the small head
and fore-quarters of the ’roo tribe, there’d be little
chance of snaring any of them with an ordinary
running noose if they knew enough to pull back,
instead of trying to force their way through. By
the way, “Werrimee” (B. 13/7/’O5) after settling
the paddymelon-kangaroo-rat difficulty, himself
confounds the rat-’roo with the quite distinct
jerboa. There are four or five kinds of rat-’roo,
some found all over Australia, but the jerboa
(Podanomalus Mitchelli) is known principally
in W. and South Australia. Further, the rat-’roos
are larger than any of the jerboas, except the
hairy jerboa of N. Australia, and are more akin to
the kangaroo, as the jerboa is to the rat.
These letters both come from the im-
mediate neighborhood of the estate alluded to,
and are both written by old residents :
Narrative 1: The Bent Government, through the Closer
Settlement Board, has decided to purchase Restdown
estate, on the Campaspe (Vic.), where the Goulburn-
Mallee irrigation scheme will cross (or go under) the Cam-
paspe, a mile below Rochester, thus ensuring the early
continuation of the channel fronr. the Waranga basin
storage to the west of the Kyabramapootra fringe. The
expected irrigation tax is said to have scared the owners
of this fine run. Bent’s engineers favor a syphon running
under the bed of the Campaspe, at a cost of £30,000, to
continue the scheme on to the thirsty Terricks, thence
on to the Mallee. Should the syphon scheme eventuate
(and it seems the safest, seeing the ; Campaspe is easily
flooded when the Malmsbury reservoirs are full to overflow-
ing) Bent may have plenty of. work for the State brick-
works ; for many thousand pounds’ worth of clay cubes
will be required. The Restdown purchase is a very wise
one, anyhow.
Then the other man writes :
Howl 2: The latest purchase by the Vic. Closer
Settlement Board betraj’s the grotesqueness of Bent’s
emasculated Act. The Restdown estate, containing
17,000 acres, lies between Rochester and Echuca. For
the most part it is miserable plain, without enough
timber to boil the billy ; swampy in winter, and with
great sun cracks in summer. Cookies round about swear
they would not attempt to farm it if it were given to
them with manure and seed wheat thrown in. Business
people of. Rochester and Echuca barracked for the
purchase. Price paid for Restdown was £3 10s., though
it is known to have been offered some years ago at
£1 10s. Any amount of farmers’ sons'round here want
land, and have been waiting for BenPs' Board to move ;
now they feel inclined to jump on the Sunday hat, and
tear the universe into long, thin strips.
All The Bulletin can say is that, if these two
people will call, they can have the use of the back
lane to come to an agreement in, and this paper
will publish the result—if the result isn’t dead.

“ E.L.” : About 50 miles from Kalgoorlie,
recently, I fell in with a tribe of blacks who were
preparing for a corroboree, and was much in-
terested in the womerbs way of fixing up their
babies for their absence. Each digs a hole in the
ground about the size of an ordinary bucket,
warms it with hot ashes, then puts baby in
“mid nodings on,” and leaves it there; and,
despite the snakes and other crawlies which
abound in the locality, she seems to always find
baby unharmed,*and quite warm and sn’ug, upon
her return after an absence of some hours.

A selector’s wife on the Orara (N.S.W.)
recently placed a child, 14 months old, in a swing,
and set two other children to swing it. They
swung it round and round, and the child, it is pre-
sumed, getting its head between the twisting
ropes, was strangled. The mother, returning in
a few minutes, found the two attendants spinning
a corpse.

“ Whaler” : Knew a publican at Bareal-
dine (Q.) who had a novel way of giving deadbeats
the “office” that credit had run out. On his
judgment day he would approach the unfinancial
one, generally after breakfast, and say : “Veil,
old man, I vill say good-bye. I am going up
town this morning, and I suppose you vill be gone
before I come back.” The hint was never known
to fail.
MUSIC.
“ How do you like your new lodgings? Don’t
the cats keep you awake? ”
“O no. I’m very fond of a noise; in fact, my
mother used always to sing me to sleep.”
“Yes,” said Bill, “I was as thin as a
match afore I got the typhoid. I never seen such
a disease for changing you. I know one bloke
who was in the hospital same time as me ; it
turned him lame in both legs. It turned another
bloke’s eyes all ways. But the curiousest case of
all, the doctor told me about. This bloke had red
hair when the typhoid took him ; when he came
out it had turned black.” “Yus,” said Bill’s
loyal mate, in support, “it alius turns somethin’.
A carpenter-bloke I knowed took it over on Cool-
gardie. Blow me when he got up if it hadn’t
changed him to a blacksmith.”

“ W.P.8.” : I know a country police-
sergeant who would take a lot of beating for
casualness (or common sense). Once witnessed a
fight in the main street of a town. The whole
populace arrived with its dog and gaped. Pre-
sently the sergeant strolled up and, entering the
ring which had been formed, spoke gently:
“Look here, me bhoys, if ye want to foight just
go down the paddick a bit, will ye?” Such a
polite request would have been hard to refuse.
The combatants shook hands and said, “ All right,
sergint,” and adjourned to the pub. that caused
the fight—and the populace cursed police inter-
ference.

“ Xerxes ” : Can any aboriginal give infor-
mation as to why no eels are to be found in the
rivers of the western slope of N.S.W. ? Also,
whether any attempt has been made to introduce
them into the western waters ? It is not for want
of mud that the rivers in question have none of
the reptiles, and in some cases only a mile or two
intervene between the eel-infested waters of one
slope and the eel-less waters of the other.
The story of “ Ratty,” as told by “ Car
rotty Joe ”
“ We called him Ratty, ’cos every night, after shearin’
was over fer the day, he’d rig- up a piece of fencin’ wire
from the v’randah post to that tree there ; pull off ’is
boots, and walk ’is ‘ tight rope,’ as ’e called it. Most of
us would be feelin’ fit ter drop, shearin’ bad sheep all day,
but nothin’ seemed to affect ’ini. He’d always fall off
’bout ’arf-way across ; then ’e ’ud get on agin, an’ swear
’e ’ud be able ter walk ter the crimson tree afore we cut
out, or bust. ’E ’ud fall ’bout ’arf-a-dozen times every
evenin’, an’ every fall would be enough to stop any ordi-
nary man from shearin’ fer a week ; but up 'e ’ud scram-
ble agin on the wire, as lively as a cricket.
“ Well, we cut out on a Thursday, an’ Ratty ’adn’t got
able ter walk ter the tree as yet. There was an onusual
big muster there that day, ter see Ratty perform, an’
’bout the third fall, ’e seemed a good bit riled. One
of the shearers says, ‘Yer’ll never do it, Ratty.’
Then ’e got more riled, an’ e’ says, 1 I’ll bet yer a quid I do
it next time.’ ‘’Ere ye’ are,’says Tom Dew prodoocin’ a
quid. Ratty started fer the tree, an’ fell agin, an’ lost ’is
quid. Some un’ laughed. With that Ratty got real mad,
an’says, ‘l’ll bet as many quids as j 7 er like I doit next
time.’ With that ’bout twent} 7 of ’em come up with
quids in their ’an’s, meanin’ ter bluff ’im, but, luv yer,
Ratty 7 wor not bluffed. ’E dived ’is ’and inter ’is mole-
skins an’ yanked out ’is cheque an’ agreed ter give the
stakes ter the cook ter ’old, an’ them that ’ad come up
with their quids ’anded ’em ter the cook.”
‘•And did he fall again ?” asked a listener, in a weak,
strained kind of voice.
“ Fall! Not ’im. ’E walked ter that tree easy as failin’
off a log. ’E wor a hackerybat.”

“ X.Y.” : “Werrimee” (B. 13/7/’O5) says
“ the kangaroo-rat is a harmless little creature,
and I have never heard him called a bad name.”
It’s evident that “ W.” never tried to grow maize
in a district where the ’roo-rat abounds, or he
would have heard his little friend made the subject
of much lurid eloquence. Aboriginaliars have
hitherto neglected the “palpoo” (native name),
so herewith a few remarks. The palpoo is the
marsupial that builds himself a house, which is
like a bird’s nest on a large scale, made of grass
and lined with teased-up fibre of stringy bark,
sometimes brought from a great distance.
The critter is a root eater, but hardly anything
comes amiss to him. He’s specially fond of the
big white wood-grub ; I’ve often poisoned
numbers of ’roo-rats by- putting minute doses of
strychnine in these grubs, and dropping them
along a furrow. His great crime is that he
digs out the maize as soon as it appears
above ground, appearing instinctively to know
that by that time most of the starch of the
grain has become sugar. The result is that
the crop has to be ploughed-out and re-
planted, perhaps several times. Carbolic acid
and coal tar have been used on the seed,
but ’roos dig until they lay the sprouted grain
bare, and, though they don’t eat it, the plant dies.
Have myself tried numerous methods of combating
the pest, but had no success until I used phos-
phorus in pollard-and-treacle baits, laid in a furrow
round the field just before planting time. Did
not find any dead on the spot, but discovered that
the subsequent mortality was about 95 per cent.
’Roo-rats travel almost incredible distances at night
and can negotiate any fence by tunnelling under
it. They differ from other marsupials in not being
scared of light and fire, and a “poo ” will let you
get within 15 or 20 yards of him. On a moonlight
night you have only to keep the moon behind you
and you drop the inquisitive little cusses one
after another as they approach and sit up to stare
at you, the white chest making a good mark.
Another plan is to go out on a dark night with a
buggy-lamp or an acetylene bike-lamp ; the palpoo,
when the light is turned on him, will sit up facing
it, offering an easy shot, The “poo’s” pelt is
worthless, and seems to be always in a state of
moult due to much fighting with his fellows and
much reckless rushing into hollow logs.
“Bunny”: West-o’-Darling is having a,
wonderfully fine season. Between Broken Hill and
Wilcannia the country is gloriously green. Very
early spring flowers grow in great closely-packed
patches, acres and acres in extent. Between
Wilcannia and Tilpa there is an unbroken expanse
of yellow flowers about six or seven miles square.
I never saw so much yellow, not even at a 12th of
July jamboree. The mail-change groom at
Mulgabelarina asserts that the station-hands call
the paddock that is so yellow, “ The Dill Maeky
Paddock.” The green flats along the Darling are
known as the Patmoran Flats. Mtilga Mat and
Coolibah Charlie have too keen a sense of humor
to take part in silly sectarian strife. These things
are a jest to them.
IN SHEOL.—FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
“Krex,” from near the middle of Aus-
tralia :
“ C.X.G.’s " tale (B. 15/6/’O5) about Ponipey, the aborigi-
nal, being- about 100 years old when he died, wants a bag
of salt. I saw Pompey six years ago, and he was then a
sprightly, well-set-up specimen of an old aborigine, able
to walk four miles an hour without exertion. He was
nearly bald. His remaining hair was white, and he was
the only nigger I ever saw with a commercial stomach.
He certainly looked not more than 70. Mr. Walker’s
intelligent nigger, now between 50 and 60 (as “ C.X.G.”
says), was a lad of 20 when Burke and Wills happened at
Innamincka (he doesn’t say how he arrives at his age, so
I suppose he must have seen his birth certificate). That
being 42 or 43 years ago, he would now be 62 or 63 for
certain. Niggers do become properly “flour bag” at
from 40 to 45.
Pompey no doubt lived longer than the average abo-
rigine, but there died at Coongy, last year, a nig. who,
according- to black tradition, was a man when Pompey
was a small boy.
My experience is that aborigines age much more
quickly than whites, and once their teeth start to go,
soon “throw in their marble.” The wearing down of
their teeth is not caused by the hard grain foods they eat,
but by the quantity of grit they chew with it.
A SERIOUS SITUATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Good mates were Bill and Jack and Dan ; together they
had travelled far.
Until at last they found themselves a few miles out of
Cannonbar.
Weary were they, and hungry too, for tucker had been
hard to cadge.
(And each one wore a set of corks around his hat—the
whaler’s badge.)
The moon was waning into eve, the sun swift sinking in
the west,
And small birds gathering overhead chirped softly as they
went to rest.
It is a place of many things—for rabbits it is just a star ;
They’re thicker than the blades of grass a few miles out
of Cannonbar.
But softly moved the coming night; the shadows deepened
on the ground,
When, presently, Bill saw the Earth begin to waltz and
whirl around.
“ I’m done 1” he gasped. “ Old pals, I’m off, Saint Peter
and his crew to meet.
By Heavens ! I’d give all Paradise for half-a-pound of juicy
meat! ”
And then he raved and wandered round ; the track he
took was circular;
“It is,” he said, “a dreadful thing to die just out of
Cannonbar.”
The rabbits, bolder in the dark, began to chew his feet
and hair,
While Jack and Daniel drove them off till they gave up
in blank despair.
“ I’m done ! ” roared Bill. “ O keep them off ! O tell them
I’m not good to eat.
0 Lord ! I only wish their bones were covered with some
proper meat! ”
How Dan was gazing at the sky, his thoughts upon a
distant star—
’Tis thus that inspiration comes a few miles out of
Cannonbar.
“ Hooroo !” he cried, “ I’ve struck a thought! Cheer up
now, Bill, it’s just your luck,
These rabbits ain’t jim-jams at all ! ” He seized a fine, fat,
festive buck.
lie slew poor bunny then and there ; he cooked him
lovely there and then.
The feast that followed was too great to be pourtrayed by
human pen.
“Ah ! Ah!” said Bill, “I’m better now. I think we’ll
stay just where we are
And live on rabbit all our days, a few miles out of
Cannonbar.
“ No need to worry now for grub, nor wander up and
down a beat,
Our tucker comes into our hands. We’ll blanky well lie
down to eat.”
And even as Bill said they did, full fed on rabbits day and
night,
Till in the end they had to get upon their hands and
knees to bite;
For they had eaten such a heap of rabbits on these plains
afar
That they became quite rabbity, a few, miles out of
Cannonbar.
Bill hid himself in hollow logs ; spring traps were Jack’s
especial hates.
A gun would make Dan gammon dead, and all grew
scared of poisoned baits.
Alas ! the Government brought out a doctor and a virus
dread,
Bill —being full of rabbit juice—and Dan and Jack alike are
dead.
Then oh ! beware, all ye who would for dread disease hold
gates ajar,
Lest 3ou should chance on their remains a few' miles out
of Cannonbar

FAIRFAX & ROBERTS,

House in Sydney,
Hunter Street,
“ C.H.R.” : Be
snakes. Fifteen or
sixteen years ago John
Bennet, now of Sas-
safras, brought from
Queensland the skin
of a carpet snake
measuring 23ft. in
length. The skin was
nailed around the
walls of the bar-parlor
of the Sadler’s Arms
Hotel, Elizabeth Town
(Tas.), kept by a
wodden - legged man
named John Spicer.
What became of the
skin since Spicer’s
death writer knoweth
not. A tiger snake
(the dusky, banded
variety with the black
nose) was found under
a log in the depth of
winter (some years
ago) at Epping Forest
(Tas.). It was brought
into Launceston alive,
and given to Thomas
Carr, chemist. He
found it to be 6ft. Sin.
in length. Carr stuffed
in, and lent it to the
Launceston Museum
for a time. The
longest snake killed
by present scribe in
Tas. measured, by
foot rule, sft. 4in. Pro-
fessor M‘Coy stated
that nearly all the
snakes in Tas. belong
to one family—the
cobras. Others are
non-venomous, includ-
ing the little white-
lipped reptile dreaded
by most Tasmanians, and commonly known as the
whip-snake. There are no whip-snakes in Tas.,
nor adders—death, deaf, or otherwise. And all
Tas. lizards are harmless.

“Eiddal”: Westward of the Kyabrama-
pootra poultry pens, Victorian cockydom is quite
delirious over the prospects of a good season
ahead, evidenced by the best rainfall experienced
“at the right time ” for 25 years past. In honor
of the joys to come, cockydom is ringing the last
of the forest giants. The dead ghosts of the
bygone bush have almost been spooked away in
smoke wreaths, without any attempt being made
to replace the timber-waste, apart from planting a
few baby pittosporums and peppers in the school
grounds during a wet spell—most of which tender
plantlings perish for want of attention when sum
mer is o’er the land. Birds, native and acclima-
tised, have been poisoned off wholesale as a
little off-season diversion, yet this area let
some frightful oaths loose when the locust
plague ravaged the land last November, as
there were few feathered friends available to
destroy the pest in the larvae and hopping stage.
There is not nearly enough stock in the district to
keep down the abnormal growth that spells dis-
aster when the crops are ripening, and the winds
sweep the plains at the advance of summer. The
season before last, it is reckoned, fully one-third
of the crops were spoilt, and rendered unfit for
anything but burning off, from this cause. Yet
cockydom consoles its collective self with the
remark that what it lost in the paddock it
made up in getting a better price for what it
had to sell. So Cockydom is glad, and rings the
last few trees gaily, so that the gales may howl
unhindered over the flattened land.

James Dish : The vitality of the Out-
'back mail-coach horses astounds me. Between
Weary Wilted Wilcannia and Kindly Killara
(100 miles) one pair of coach-horses runs 40 miles.
The next two do 60 miles as their stage, and re-
turn after about 12 hours’ spell. Surely there can
be no hell for the mail coach horses of Past-
Purther-Out and Right-Out-Baek after all they
endure on the heart-break tracks.

“Timbarra” : White ’possums, one of
which was lately unearthed by Melb. Age, are
not altogether uncommon in Australia. Twenty
years ago, in the mountains near Gilmore
(N.S.W.), there used to be a whole tribe of the
pink-eyed beauties, and there are a few knocking
round there still. But, more remarkable than an
albino ’possum, was a pure white magpie, with
red legs and a red beak, which I saw in possession
of a Mrs. Harris, of Moama (N.S.W.). It was
obtained from a nest containing also three ordinary
black-and-white magpies.
THE OTHER BLOKE.
JARGO JONES : “ Who’s thatsh over (hic) there ?”
GINGER SAM : “ Oh, thatsh Lyne an’ Reid.”
J.J.: “ And which ’s Reid ?”
G.S.: “ Th' fat bloke.”
J.J.: “I know that, you (hie) fool; but whch's
Lyne ?”
The settlers about Fowler’s Bay (S.A.)
have been having a somewhat lively time; with
the natives, who are continually robbing their
huts and making off into the scrub with the booty.
Prosecution does not seem to remedy matters,
and many of the settlers are growing desperate,
and threaten to take the law into , their own
hands. To make matters worse, several strange
tribes have come in from the North and made
their appearance in the district. They are a
wild, angry lot, and their language is unknown to
the other Northern blacks.
* * * *
“AZeiwood”: “Fluff” (B. 27/7/’O5) has evi-
dently seen a different variety of starling from
the thousands which live in this (Morwell, Vic.)
district. Here the birds do not dab nests roughly
about the branches of a tree, nor do they occupy
nests in common. They are sociable all through
the remainder of the year, and fly homeward to
the ti-tree morass every evening in great com-
panies, but as soon as winter comes they seem to
lose most of their social instinct, and pair off to
rear their brood in the hollow limbs of dead trees.
I have seen several nest-holes occupied in the
same tree, but each pair seems to have its own
family. This habit of rearing its young when
there is no other food than grubs and worms is
pretty fair evidence that the bird is mainly insec-
tivorous, and, consequently, a farmer’s friend.
* * * *
“Ne’er-do-weel”: When are we going to
hear the last of the bilby as a “ rare Australian
animal ” ? Periodically, I come
across paragraphs in the press to
the effect that there has come
into the possession of some
zoological society a specimen
of the bilby or rabbit bandi-
coot (Peragala lagotie),
“a rare Australian ani-
mal.” The bilby is by
no means a rare Austra-
lian animal. All over
Southern Queensland, west of
the range, it is fairly common.
Rabbiters get plenty of them,
and their burrows are pitfalls, in
places, for the unwary horseman. Bilby
is not often seen, as his habits are noc-
turnal, but he is not particularly hard to
catch. His winter coat is beautifully thick and
soft, and a bilby-skin rug is more to be prized
than many ’possum rugs.
* * • *
“Ne’er-do-Weel” : Bulletin (13/7/B5)
suggests the exclusion of the opium-smoker to
stop opium smuggling. A good idea if practic-
able, but how would you deal with aboriginal and
white smokers and eaters? A very large per-
centage of bush men in Queensland either eat or
smoke opium. I believe it is not so bad as it used
to be, but 20 years ago 50 per cent, habitually
carried opium. Things are not too good in Central
Queensland in this respect to day.

“R. Hap ” : “ W.P.8.” was fortunate in
his sleeping-out experience (B. 20/7/’O5). The night
my cargo of whisky shifted and gave me a bad
list to port, I took myself and the remains of an
argument into a public park to consider things.
I slept. Then somebody borrowed my hat and
boots, and stole the cigar stump and the umbrella.
I woke much relieved. Next night I set out with
a revolver and a length of bar iron, and a burning
desire for revenge. I lay down and waited. . . I
awoke in the small hours, minus my armory;
and my burning desire had gone black out, and I
was a human refrigerator. Then I spoke things to
myself and started for home.
“Veldt” (S. Africa): That “tired feel-
ino, ”of the Australian must have had its origin
long before Captain Cook came along. Have
lately been meditating over the flora and fauna ot
Australia and have noted :
1. That the ’roo’s tail has been so developed that its
wearer can lean gracefully upon it when tired.
2. The boomerang:, so much used by the aborigine to
kill his ’possum, is so fashioned that when it fails to strike
the ’possum it returns to the thrower. (By the way, let
me remark that I know that the boomerang is neither
flora nor fauna. But the man who makes it is fauna.)
3. The gum-tree, instead of shedding its leaves like any
other respectable tree, sheds its bark clearly a more
simple process and much less likely to weary it, or give it
a pain in the side.

“ Borig ” : A few years ago a milk-loaded
bullock dray, crossing a flooded creek (South Coast,
N.S.W.), was overturned by the flood, and the cans
were swept away, all but one being soon after-
wards recovered. About 18 months later a man
getting sand from the bed of the creek unearthed
the missing can, intact, and when it was opened
the milk was still there and perfectly fresh,
though it soon went bad when the air got to it.
The cow that gave the milk is dead now, but 1 can
show you its calf as evidence of the truth of this
story.

If the little town of Tantanoola, in the
south-east of S.A., had never imagined a tiger,
very few people in the Commonwealth would ever
have heard of its existence. (The pronoun is
'vague, but it will do for either the town or the
tiger.) The original tiger was killed, by the way,
and proved to be a large dog, or a fox, or a covv,
or something (for all The Bulletin remembers it
might have been a horse), but people seem to for-
get its violent end, and whenever a man full of
beer sees a specially large shadow in the bush
after dark, he recognises the late lamented. There
used, by the way, to be a white boa-constrictor on
the road between Hillgrove and Grafton (N.S.W.),
on the long descent leading down to the Nym-
boida River, where the cliff rises on one side of
the road and the precipice falls away on the other.
The writer was traversing that road once about 10
p.m., aimed with a knapsack, an empty flask, and
a sandwich, when he saw the beast and tried to
climb up it with a matcli in his hand, thinking
there was a board at the top stating how many
miles it was to somewhere. Then the thing wob-
bled its head at him and whirled about, and he
fell into the road. Further investigation, made
in the gloom when the white boa-constrictor had
left off sticking out its neck and whirling at him,
revealed to the writer that it was a sapling, with a
vine hanging from it, but it looked a first-class
white boa-constrictor for the moment.
“ W.P.8.” : All policemen haven’t got
big intellects as well as big feet. A sergeant in
charge of a country district —I won’t say where ;
I'm afraid—had to arrest three men on a charge
of sheep-stealing. He made inquiries, and heard
that three men had been seen along the road. He
set out after them, and it was night when he
reached a fire, around which were seated the
alleged mutton-stealers. Calmly and in measured
voice he told them they were “arristed,” and to
“ come along.” They wanted to know the charge.
The sergeant said, “Begorra, Oi’ve forgot; ye’ll
have to wait here till I go back and foind out.”
In time he returned, but two out of the three had
bolted.- “Where’s them two other min?” he
inquired, and seemed hurt that they hadn’t
stopped. Curiosity alone should have led them
to do that. “ Ye’re arristed for shape-stalin’, but
as ye’re honest and didn’t thry to make a bowlt
ye can go.” I thanked him, and refilled me poipe,
and thought it very casual and considerate. I was
one of the min that didn’t stale the shape.

“ Alone ” : Have any of the more, truthful
aboriginals noticed Mrs. Wayback’s shake-hands
habit, grafted into her by the parsons? All bush
parsons deem it their duty to give a smile-and-
hand-sliake in, free, with any and every possible
transaction. Church, sewing bee, gossip, tea-
fight, prayer meeting. The handshake is an ever
present preliminary and finale. Nowadays Mrs.
Wayback and her handsome daughters can hardly
enter a door without instinctively putting out
their hands. Apropos, at a hospital benefit enter-
tainment in our township lately, the only one of
us with anything like a holy appearance was “ on
the door.” He got his hand shaken by pretty well
the whole female population for 10 miles round.
Every time he held out the thing he lifts his tea
with for Mrs. and Miss Cowwoman’s entrance fee,
those ladies grabbed it with a pleased expression,
shook it well while the crowd waited behind, and
then swept proudly to their places. There is more
shake than money in the backblocks.

“ Bung I.” : Re your pars about twig gold-
diviners. Was on the North Lead at Kanowna,
in its best days, sinking to try and pick up a lost
lead. While hauling one day, noticed an
ephemeral-looking individual with a rod walking
about our claim. I was too busy to study him very
closely, so don’t know whether the twig bent down
or not. Anyhow, the temporary-looking character
came over to me after fooling with his stick for
about 15 minutes, and in a stage whisper said :
“ Say, old man, don’t say anything, hut you will
strike it pretty rich here.” Of course I thanked
the transient individual and hoped he would he a
true prophet. We eventually bottomed a duffer.
I found out afterwards that the person who looked
as if he wouldn’t last long had breathed the same
information into the ear of every other claim-
holder in our locality ; so my mates and self con-
cluded he was on the make, hoping, if someone out
of the several struck anything, he would be pre-
sented with a bonus.

“ C.X.Gr.’s ” improbable tale :
Hergott Springs (S.A.) was christened by a blackfellow.
A white woman resident there gave one of her house gins
an old bustle. The gin was very proud of the ornament,
and put it on outside of her dress. Unfortunately, she
wore it rather low, and when she went to sit down in
camp she bounced, somewhat like an india-rubber hall.
Upon which her old man remarked, “ My word, her got
springs.” The name stuck.

No notice (except of a hostile character) ivill be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Alex Z. : “Break” is too wholesale in its im-
morality Dandelup : Only some gentle verse about
the “sparkling - stream.”....VV.M.M. : Mild verse about
the “ babbling - br00k.”... .Shirley : “ Lode ” too long for
interest J.G. : “ Drummoyne ”is only a general and
ordinary yearning to be with your best girl.... Prospect
Good : Both legends as rugged as a blasted A1p....
Alpha : Verses about the “ whirling wheel ” don’t whirl
worth a copper. Bike verses should revolve something-
tremendous B.E.D. : “Affinity” and three others
regretfully declined... .Frani: “Raft” only a moderate
kind of story.... V.S. : “Alps of Australia” rather flat,
and the world has no use for a fiat Alp Alastor :
“Dreams” rejected after some hesitation....C.R.H. :
“Worker” and “Nicotine” both as jagged as a fish
skeleton... .P.M. : “ Ghosts ” and “Final Flutter ” don’t
strike us much... .D. : A pretty little thing, but better
suited to a religious paper... .K.D. : “ Avalon ” is just a
Moan, and it doesn’t seem to know what it is moaning-
about . ..E. J. Butters : Many thanks for letter D.M. :
“ Clerk’s Lament ” is an adaptation of an old bit of verse
that was hardly worth adapting... .D.B. :No good points
about “ Love ” or “ Speak,” and both bad to decipher....
W.P.Y. : A picture is not a cinematograph. You can’t
put all these emotions and gesticulations and free fights
into it LB. A. : Typed preferably, but not necessarily ;
one side only ; and the rest depends absolutely on quality
and the sort of market there is for the time being
J. Bennett: Too far away to sift the matter; and we
couldn’t accept one party’s say-so in such a case
Wogger : Nothing in either of ’em... .Lanyard : Not well
enough told Walter M‘B. : Could do nothing with
that.. .. J.H.T. : Too microscopic... .V.J.B. : 111-spelt and
ill-written Tom S. :No use to us Mark Well: Not
class enough Lerli: Nothing new or striking about
your travel-impressions... ..Jackdaw : Falls off greatly
towards the end Vampire: Crude and uninteresting.
Old Pro. : Good material, but quite off our beat
j.M. : “ Porcupine ” needed crisper and livelier treat-
ment P.O. : “ Inconsistency ” is a heartrending
attempt at verse Viking: About four times too long - ,
... .W.E.H. : Lamentable “ humor.”.... Wal V. : Anaemic
and futile.... .H.B. (S.A.) : Cut out and send to Bulletin
accountant Doll’s House : No ; you haven’t improved
it. You haven’t the art of leaving out the inessential.,.,
L.B. : Apparently founded on Brunton Stephens’ famous
rabbit-pie incident... .T. Nicholson: If you know the
parish, your best plan would be to get somebody to ex-
amine the register thereof.. *. Bert M.: On strong lines,
but clumsily handled Carswell: Moderate merit only,
D.H.R. : “Per Contra” is weak and ill-finished
MaryM.M. : Both rather stiff and prosy A.C.P.: Yours
is a “master-hand,” you modestly say. Well, we find.it
a “prentice-hand,” and a pretty dull prentice at that....
J.G.P.: Hopelessly unsuitable.. ..Cyril V.: Pleasing-
treatment of a threadbare theme.. Young Australia:
Still too long F.8.Q.: Commenced to lick it into
shape, but found the task too tough The Condemned :
Prophetic pen-name... .F.H.R. : “Association” nearly
got through, but the other is very clumsy work...,
R.M.E.: Required a crisper touch Bendi: No good—
and cost us 4d. short postage Tracker: Has sonie in-
terest, but the style doesn’t suit Tub Bulletin ....
C.L.J. : “Only Man is Vile” accepted Yiddisher :
Verses hardly' suitable Constant Reader: No, it was
Colonel Tom‘Price who said that... .T.W.: “Democracy”
reads like the kind, of verse that might mean almost
anything Myall: “Elysium” declined, though it is
a nice mossy poem with “ moonshine ” and “ sheen ” and
“creepers.” in it Svengali: “Buy a Gun” and
“Parlor and Bar” accepted Nen : Well, the circum-
stantial evidence yarn very nearly got in....F.M. :
“Falsehood Sweet” is good verse, but we don’t care to
rush headlong into theological discussion unless the verse
is better than good. Theological discussion is a.thing
that bites violently when it gets you down Oliver:
“ Sick and Sound” suffers from too much irregularity of
metre Nym : Don’t write as if you were trying to do
the Lord’s prayer on a threepenny piece. You have
no idea what a misery your copy is at times...,
E.C.N. : Not much to be expected from an effusion
that begins by likening the “stampers’ roar” to the
“ crooning ”of the sea.... J.O’B. : Frigid and unconvinc-
ing style St. Kilda: Yes, you have ability of a kind ;
but the items sent are unsuitable W.H.H. : Versifica-
tion mechanically correct, but you don’t say anything....
Happy J. : You don’t get much of the happiness into
your screed, at all events... .Nightshade : Just missed
the mark. Have another shot, and check your tendency
to magniloquence Wager : Your friend is right. There
are true cods ( Gadidce ) in M.L. waters, but notin Aus-
tralian. The Murray “ cod ”is of the perch family.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
J.K. : “Accommodation” not very humorous, and the
boy looks like a disease... .Roy : “ Contra ” bad drawing
and filthy joke John J. : Good, but we published
Crick, by another artist, quite recently M‘G. : De-
stroyed accordingly—destroyed gladly, in fact. Always
willing to destroy things like that J.E.P. : Pretty
close to acceptance mark S. 18 : Aged and tawdry
joke T.L.B. : Joke won’t carry the picture L.L.D. :
Hardly suitable. All sketches accepted are paid for
A.E.K. : Never saw a picture just like yours before.
Never expect to see one like it again.... E.E.M. : Too crude.
F.G. : Quite impossible as drawings. One may possibly
do as suggestion H.S.: “ Dentists ” quite hopeless
W.J.M. : Thanks, but have no use for sketches that have
to be plastered with explanatory remarks.
Unsuitable :—Dot.
“Biblicist”: Joseph ought to have
thought of the Assouan Dam. It could have been
done in seven years. The stone for the useless
Pyramids, centuries before his time, came from
Syene, not far from Assouan.
According to Sydney Worker, softie Jap-
manufactured white linen shirts, sold in Sydney,
were found to mysteriously shed their fronts and
cuffs in going through the wash: Subsequent
examination disclosed that the shoddy brown per-
son had hit upon the device of glueing those parts
of the garment!
Baron Suyematsu tells London ‘Magazine
readers of the Mikado’s accomplishments :
His Majesty does not indulge in games of any sort, but
he is a great poet, and his chief pastime is the composition
of poems. Ordinarily, Japanese poems are very short,
but it would astonish anyone when he hears that his
Majesty composes on an average four or five of these
poems every day. Consequently, his poems are already
voluminous. He is vqry quick in the work of com-
position, and his work is considered by experts to be very
excellent. The meaning of one poem is as follows :
Whenever I open
The ancient Books,
The one thing I ponder is—
How goes it with the people I rule ?
It must be a considerable brain that can think out
1825 masterpieces like the above each year.

Rheumatic and Qouty Affections.
(By “Origin.”)
The unnatural retention of uric acid and other urinary and biliary poisons in the blood produces a
group of complaints which inflict upon humanity long continued suffering and intense pain. Lhe
most common of these complaints are rheumatism, gout, lumbago, sciatica, and neuralgia. lhe kid-
neys and liver are the organs upon which Nature has imposed the task of extracting from the blood
certain matter which is being continuously manufactured in the body, owing to the wasting ot the
tissues. It is as necessary to life that the wasting of the tissues must proceed uninterruptedly as it is
that the substance of the body must be regularly renewed by the food we eat, the water we drink, and
tlie air we breathe. It is equally necessary to health that the waste matter should be expelled Irom
the body continuously, for its presence in the blood entails disease or death.
The treatment of rheumatic and gouty affections by the outward application of liniments, oint-
ments and embrocations is seldom productive of much lasting benefit. They may afford temporary
relief in some cases, but they do not reach the seat of the disorder. The only way in which health can
be permanently restored, aiid pain permanently removed, is to take measures to ensure the regular
action of the kidneys and the liver. When these organs are performing their allotted task naturally
and freely, the uric acid, and other urinary and biliary poisons, pass from the system through the
ordinary channels, and any suffering caused by the presence of such poisons in the blood is at an end.
Owing to its specific action, Warner’s Safe Cure, every moment during the past twenty-five years,
has been demonstrating its remarkable power of restoring the kidneys and liver to health and activity.
Warner’s Safe Cure not onlv cures Bright’s Disease and other specific diseases of those vital organs,
but rheumatism, gout, gravel, stone, bladder troubles, indigestion, biliousness, anaemia, impure blood
and all disorders caused by the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons, speedily yield
to the influence of the medicine, simply because of its healing and stimulating influence upon the
kidneys and liver. Cures thus effected are permanent, simply because they are natural.
A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some urine, passed the
first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning. If it is then
cloudy, shows a sediment like brick-dust, is of an unnatural color, or has particles floating about in i,t
the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their vigor, or
Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric poisoning will result. [2.

PABLIAMENTARY PERSONALITIES.
A DESULTORY IMPRESSION.
[For Tiie Bulletin.] '
Even yet all the personages of the Australian Par-
liament do not show out in clear relief. There has
not been time. There have been too many petty
issues, intruding like the “faults” in the earth’s
strata, to allow of a definite settlement. But
time has at least justified the selection of the
three leaders —Watson, Deakin, and Reid. They
are, without doubt, the most individual men of
their parties.
* * * *
Deakin, who is in the view of most the natural
leader of the House, owes a good deal to the per-
sonal friendships he inspires. He also suffers a
good deal from the wiles of those who know that
an easy way to his confidence is a profession of
personal attachment. The man is magnetic. He
radiates electrical impulses. A first rough impres-
sion of his face is of black—black, stiff, wiry
hair, black beard growing close up to black eyes—
the blackness of a carbon pencil in an arc lamp
before the current is turned on. When he talks,
Deakin glows. His quick, eager grasp of an idea
is something to delight in. Again, there is the
inevitable suggestion- of the electrical, as there is
in his quick, hot friendships. Withal, Deakin
lacks most of the essential qualities of a
politician. His mind is utterly at variance in
its methods of working with the public mind.
In the Australian community, he is often
hopelessly misunderstood. He soars; and the
public has learned to associate soaring with
pill advertisements. He delights in explain-
ing ; and the public detests explanations. On
a hundred points of a complex and attractive
character Deakin offers an easy mark even to a
stupid plotter. It is only political qualities
Deakin lacks to make him the complete leader.
He has no sordid chains ; his family life is simple,
adorned with music and letters, and unalloyed by
any vexed strivings for “ society ” delights.

Watson is wanting in warmth. There is not a
man of his party, hardly a man in the House,
who does not look to him with respect and liking.
But I doubt whether there is one who would
open-eyed go over a precipice with him. Watson
would never do a rash thing ; never, I believe, an
impulsive thing. He is wise always. That is the
sort of character which inspires attachments
rather than devotions. To make of Watson a
great national leader there is only lacking more
warmth, more imagination. For he is certainly a
great politician. He has tact, a sunny tact which
disarms all suspicion of his making an effort to be
pleasant. He is progressive, but cautious ; prac-
tical, but sincere. The combination is rare. The
“ practical politician,” as a rule, is prepared to
believe anything, or do anything, so long as it is
“good politics.” Watson, with all his caution
and practicalness, holds to genuine beliefs, and
would probably sooner sacrifice his Parliamentary
career altogether than be guilty of a desertion.
Add to the combination of cool caution and since-
rity a natural dignity that makes Watson the
equal in any company, and a natural genius for
friendliness, and there is the ideal politician. In
private life Watson is of simple tastes, with a
passion for athletics.

The key to Reid’s political character, his friends
say, is that “he doesn’t know.” That explains
ali his actions which have called for harsh
comment. He doesn’t study Freetrade, or Pro-
tection, or Socialism, or Federation, or any other
of the subjects which come up for decision, but
looks at the surface of things, considers the
current of public opinion, and takes up a position.
That position he changes with aplomb and perfect
faith in his own righteousness whenever occasion
demands. He has a passionate belief in his own
capacity for leadership and administration, and
honestly believes that, compared with the per-
sonal side, all other political considerations
are of little weight. Reid’s following, since
he got firmly fixed in the saddle in New
South Wales, has always been held in subjec-
tion by dread, not liking. Reid seldom
courts personal popularity, and, when he does,
usually blunders. But he is able to exact unques-
tioning obedience from men and newspapers that
deeply dislike him. The man’s faith in himself
is wonderful, and he is able to make others share
it. In private life Reid cultivates the domestic
virtues strenuously. He rarely shades in such
masculine habits as drinking or smoking, and
seems to devote himself with much earnestness to
the care of a young family. The prospect which
faces every politician in Australia —a penurious old
age—-is said to fill him with dread, and to be the
only check on a remarkably ambitious nature.

George Turner is an instance of the success
which concentration brings. He was a small
suburban solicitor, with a wife who believed in
him and saw no reason why he should not be first
man in his suburb. He plodded along the muni-
cipal track to mayoral greatness, and that brought
him to Parliament. The wifely ambition in-
creased, and the husband plodded industriously
along on a broad, as he had done on a narrow, track
to leadership. There came the smash of the boom,
and Turner was the man marked out to drag the
dead horse through the mud ; and he plodded
along honestly, happily, only allowing himself
the luxurv of occasionally threatening to give up
the office which he loved. What he did for Vic-
toria won him a place in the first Australian
Ministry, in which he did excellent work. To be
in the second (Deakin’s) Ministry was to him quite
natural. He was a good deal surprised, doubtless,
not to be in the third (Watson’s) Ministry, and
quite naturally took office in the fourth (Reid’s),
with the customary declaration of unwillingness.
George Turner has probably no very clear political
ideas at all; but he likes administrative work, and
his better half loves the glory of office. In any
elected Australian Cabinet he would be chosen as
Treasurer.
* * * *
William John Lyne is one of the most maligned
men in the House. But when The Bulletin
christened him “the rogue elephant” it was the
worst that could be honestly said of him. Ihe
fact that Lvne is a poor man to-day, though
always living simply, is a sufficiently conclusive
answer to the yarns of his enemies. With the
opportunities he has had, if byne had taken at all
a sordid interest in politics, he could be a very
rich man. Where Lyne challenges criticism is in
his exceedingly artful political manmuvnng and
his ruthless political enmities. His persuasive
tongue can cause the most remarkable “ reversals
of form ” in the House, and the whips on the other
side, who find that the rogue elephant has
trampled down all their elaborate corrals and
hedges, naturally blaspheme and think wicked
thoughts. What counts much to the credit of
this man—who is a good deal on the Dibbs lines
with less courage but more cuteness —is his fidelity
to friendships. It is sometimes, though, an awk-.
ward thing in politics. Lyne has got into his
choicest rows by his desire to “oblige a pal.”
Big, bluff, hearty, with something of the dandy
showing in his button-hole and invariable frock
coat, Lyne, when he’s«-done a-jumping on the
enemy, favors the company of political ladies and
young politicians. And both are inclined to like
him.
* * * *
Another well-hated man is Conroy. Didactic,
censorious, always ready to rush to the front with
an accusation, Conroy, only for the standing
orders against homicide, would have been slain a
score of times —with an axe, for he is a big, brawny
man with a marred nose which tells of delight in
battle. But there is much good in Conroy. He
is the anarchist of the House, the man with no
reverence for any propriety or convention or
scruple When he sees what he considers a duty
ahead. And at least one such man is needed in
every Assembly. The man is admirable for his
courage, even when he makes of himself a nuisance
and an absurdity.
* * ♦ *
Sydney Smith is said to be the cleverest
“whip” in the House. It is mostly because of
his providential hair equipment. Sydney Smith
has a rufous cascade of beard that masks his face
from the cheek-bones down. Behind that thicket
of hair he lurks, and what he is thinking of no
man knowetli. The curtain is never lifted, except
when the red beard divides to show a chasm of
genial smile. So Smith has a reputation for im-
perturbable good temper and genial tact. He
may be muttering curses half his time, but the
Shagpat beard betrays nothing.
* * * *
Senator Higgs, who looks as solemn as an
undertaker, is really one of the humorists of the
Legislature. Compositor and then journalist, he
has had a lengthy working experience of two
States, Queensland and New South Wales, and this,
perhaps, gives him a broader outlook than that of
some of his fellow members. He is thoroughly
Australian in his views, and his range of in-
terests is exceptionally wide. A good man in the
lobby, he is marked out to lead in the Senate for
some future Administration.
* * * *
Bruce Smith is something of a •figure. His
intellect is dyspeptic and obtrusive. He nourishes
it on a particular type of hard economics and
proudly displays its resultant struggles in public.
In that way he shows thoughtfulness. Bruce
Smith has a reputation for sincerity which makes
members forgive him his vanity and his lack of
humor. There is a characteristic story of him
when he was manager of the shipping co. in which
he was once concerned. The rules decreed that
the head steward of the company’s vessels coming
into port must report to the manager in uniform.
A steward once, pressed for time, reported to B.
Smith in his shore clothes. Smith refused to
believe that he was the chief steward. “ The
chief stewards of our service report to me in uni-
form. You are notin uniform. Therefore you
are not chief steward of the' With this
triumphant syllogism ringing in his ear the
unhappy steward went back to his boat, donned
his official clothes, and was then affably received
by the manager.
W. M. Hughes has almost the keenest intellect
in the Parliament. With many things against
him—a dyspepsia which made food a horror, a
deafness which made attendance at a debate an
ordeal—he has conquered circumstances which
would appal most. His early education was
liberal (he was a school-master in England) but
coming to Australia he at first was almost
submerged. Full of energy and of inventive
resource, he lacked confidence ; his nature was in
some respects timid. In half-a-dozen curious ways
he made a little living before he got his head
above water. Then he resumed the work of self-
education with fierce energy, qualified for
journalism, politics, and the Bar, and finally became
a Cabinet Minister. The hard gruelling he has
had from fate has made Hughes a little bitter, and
his discretion is often at fault. Those are the
flecks on a truly remarkable character. Hughes’
humor is abundant but generally a little acrid.
He doesn't mind turning it against himself. “I
don’t think these portraits do you justice, sir,”
said a smoodging official to Hughes, bringing in
some portraits of the Watson Cabinet. “Oh,
justice be damned ! ” retorted Hughes; “ my face
wants mercy.” And in truth the stress of life has
gnarled Hughes’ face a little. Very many of the
good jokes of politics circle round Hughes. One
night, in the N.S.W. Assembly, he got solemnly
included in the schedule of native flora to be
preserved the periwinkle, under its Latin name.
The man who plays tricks like that handicaps
himself for Parliamentary advancement, but he
keeps his thoughts young. There is not much
friendship between Deakin and Hughes. But
they are very much alike in their love for fun
of that sort.
Senator Matheson (W.A.)is a sunny Australian,
lacquered with Oxford “culture.” He treats
politics as a sport. He has his trousers made in
London, but his opinions are mostly made in
Australia. Rich, debonnair, Matheson is soundly
democratic on most issues, and will possibly get to
office some day. Then he will work ; there is
work in him.
W. H. Kelly (N.S.W.) lets it be known
clearly that he is an Oxford man. He acts it
artistically, with evidences of continuous re-
hearsal. His first advent to the House caused a
little stir. , Politicians—the general impression to
the contrary is false —are very kind to new mem-
bers. The hoary hacks of the benches view the
young novice as a thrice-bereaved widow does a
virgin bride at the altar—with a feeling that is a
little envious, a good deal sympathetic, and alto-
gether kindly. Kelly was at first “taken up.”
He showed himself rather too confident and
didactic to win popularity. He has, however,
some cleverness, and may in time get, by dint of
hard work, to a standing in the House.
* * * *
One of the promising youngsters of the House is
Groom of Queensland who, after a very short
term of Parliament, has risen to Cabinet rank in
the present Ministry. A barrister by profession
Groom has shown a capacity for dogged detail
work ; in the opinion of some he should have been
Australian Treasurer, and is marked out by
character to be a good Exchequer man. Another
of the coming young men is Senator Keating of
Tasmania. Keating has a look of unctuous and
rosy candor (he suggests Dan ,Cupid, grown up
and in Holy Orders) which masks # a subtle and
industrious mind.
* * * *
An interesting Senator is blind Jock McGregor
—a fat, smiling Scot, overflowing with cheerful-
ness and finding in his affliction only fresh reasons
for trusting in the goodness of human nature.
McGregor has a marvellous memory, and if a
short Bill is read over to him twice ne can after-
wards take part in the Committee debate, know-
ing its every word. Deep affection is felt for the
old man among the Labor members, and they play
pranks on him as on a dear uncle. When he was
asked to join the Watson Ministry he was assured
by some jokers that a condition was made that he
should accept a K.C.M.G., and he almost believed
it, and worried sadly over such an unkind blow.
* * * *
Joseph Cook must get all his score in Parlia-
ment by hard work ; no personal popularity helps
him. A cold, reserved, cautious man, very effec-
tive in debate, where he wields a shrewd tongue,
Cook probably does not understand the bitterness
with which the Labor party regards him. He was
willing to be in with the Watson party. It
would not have him, and he took his ambitions to
another market. His pertinacity and singleness
of purpose would probably bring Cook far, but
that it is doubtful whether he has enough physical
stamina for a long, hard struggle. Cook’s health is
poor, and that is given by those who know
him best as an excuse for an occasional display of
irritability and impatience.
A * * *
The Westralian contingent to the Australian
Parliament is of a high standard of interest.
John Forrest carries with him into debate the
weight of a man who has done something. He is
a poor politician, prone to blazing indiscretions,
which make the Opposition rejoice, but his old
pioneering work pleads for him, and his character
is wholesome and hearty. Few men in the House
have more personal friendships, and even when,
during the life of the Labor Ministry, Forrest was
misled into actions which showed neither dignity
nor sense, it seemed to make no perceptible differ-
ence in the number of “ good old Johns’’heard
from members of all parties in the lobbies. Another
interestingGroperis Senator Staniforth Smith, who
takes his political work so seriously that during
recess he always appoints himself as a commission
to inquire into some matter of Federal importance.
Smith is a typical Australian. He was hard-up as
a young man when the Melbourne boom burst,
went out west, worked at anything and every-
thing, and in a- few years was of independent
means, and now devotes his time to politics.
There are, of course, other notable men in the
Parliament. Isaacs, the hardest worker and the
clearest thinker of the lot, who lives on law-books
and milk; Batchelor, who “understudies” J.
C. Watson; Ewing, the poetic; and Chapman,
acute and suave; but this is not a catalogue of
personages—rather an impression of personalities
—a desultory view of Parliament from the lobby.
F.R.
It is estimated that the highly-Protected
U.S.A. received 1,000,000 immigrants during the
year ended June 30, 1905, and these, in conse-
quence of stringent immigration laws, were
all practically picked persons—the blind," diseased,
and pauper “culls ” drift across to the worlds
tip, Britain. Three schemes for making entrance
into the U.S. more difficult are under considera-
tion —(1) An increased head-tax from Bs. to £4 or
£5 each; (2) limitation of the number of immi-
grants from each country; and (3) an education
test.
A Bearer of Burdens.
Relieved by Mother Seigel’s Syrup prom the
Torture of Indigestion and Backache,
in Melbourne.
A man who has been accustomed to hard work
and who, when he is well, seems to like it, is Mr.
Henry W. Rood, a “ wharf-lumper” by calling,
who lives at 80 Grey-street, West Melbourne.
He is a big, hearty, burly man and attributes his
illness to the strain imposed on his back by carry-
ing heavy burdens, such as frozen carcases of
mutton, from the railway trucks to the ships’
slings. Of course his trouble really originated
with some defect in his digestion and when that
was remedied, as he tells you, by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup, his other troubles disappeared also.
Here is his letter, dated January 4, 1905:
Towards the end of 1903 I began to ail and feel
generally out of sorts. I was unable .to sleep well,
lost all my apnetite and was never free from
severe pains in the small of the back and between
the shoulders. I tried many different medicines,
but for six months I could find nothing that would
do me any real, permanent good. I was always
ailing, depressed, and in pain.
“Then a relative who was in Melbourne on a
visit from Castlemaine, said he had known of
several cases in the country much like mine which
had been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup ; so I
thought I would try it. I improved so much while
taking the first bottle that I kept on with it, and
when I had taken four bottles in all, my health
was thoroughly re-established, and I was free from
all the pains which I had been subject to for so
long a time.
“ I could also eat, sleep and work as well as ever
I did ; perhaps better than at any previous period
of my life. When my friends congratulated me
on my recovery and improved appearance, I told
them all that the whole of the credit for it was en-
tirely due to Mother Seigel’s Syrup, and to that
alone.”*

POLITICAL
POINTS
Queensland Government is thinking over a
measure to prohibit the export of brood mares.
The Monkey has lately bought large mobs, and
still has buyers at work ; so if the State wants to
lock the stable door before the last mare is stolen
it had better look sharp.
Premier Carruthers, of N.S.W. : “Intem-
perate advocacy of a wholesale reform delayed
that reform more than anything else.” Well, did
anybody ever accuse Carruthers of intemperate
advocacy of wholesale reform? Intemperate
sitting on a rail, and a tendency to get drunk on
compromise, are more in his line.
Premier Morgan, of Queensland, favors
the proposal to do away with the useless and time-
wasting Address-in-Reply, which involves a
general chat on everything under the sun, and
leaves everything just where it was. It is strange
that that utterly needless palaver and promiscuous
gossip wasn’t abolished long ago.
The prospect that the Deakin Government
will carry the Iron Bonus Bill through this time
turns attention on Parramatta and Emu Bay.
Those parts of N.3.W. and Tasmania respectively
will be the first to feel the influence of the new
national policy. The first works will, it is stated,
be erected on the Parramatta River, and a large
quantity of the ore will be drawn from the region
of Emu Bay.
Questions tabled by Mr. Perry in the
N.S.W. Assembly:—
Is it a fact that the Sydney daily press and the Sunday
Times are advocating Government grading for butter and
other New South Wales products ?
Will the Government also appoint a Government grader
to grade the stuff retailed by Sydney newspapers, in
order to protect the public against deleterious articles
and adulterated truth which have been so freely distri-
buted for some years ?
What Australia has to gain from the pay-
ment to Britain of naval tribute is practically nil,
even if all the conditions of the agreement are
observed. But Britain doesn’t even worry to keep
the agreement. The naval force lent is still one
cruiser and three sloops less than was stipulated
for, and there are only 823 Australians all told
serving or being trained on the different vessels,
whereas the agreement undertook to provide effi-
cient training for at least 1333 men.
The late no-confidence motion in Westralian
Parliament was a first-class exhibition of political
acrobatics. After turning 14 complicated somer-
saults, the three parties alighted exactly where
they were before, and the Opposition has felt
pretty sore and stiff in the knees since. It missed
Nanson, its acrobat-in-chief, who is seriously ill.
Nanson is a clever man, but he is led astray by
his anxious ambition and is always running after
two omnibuses at once and missing them both.
ANY PORT IN A STORM.
LAND AGENT (at the gates of Hades, knocking and
ringing at the same time): 11 Heigh! Heigh!
Open, quick! Fair whacks! I’ll go you
halves! You can have three-quarters! O
take the lot, hut let me in! HERE'S a
ROYAL COMMISSION.”
“Disorganised," “ discouraged ” and “dis-
heartened ” are the terms which General Buller
uses about the British land forces—the forces
which Lord Roberts asserts are just as bad as at
the time of the Boer war. How about the navy,
one naturally asks ? The army has been tried in
two large wars within the last 60 years, and proved
each time a brave but disorganised mob. The
present navy hasn’t been tested at all, and hasn’t
fired a shot in anger, except at some nigger
village.
G. Ousted Reid lias broken all previous
records in the way of Parliamentary grief by his
howls since he was ejected from office. Deakin
went out as though the House had done him a
personal favor by voting against him. Watson
smiled when notice-to-quit was delivered, and
dropped the subject. But Reid’s bleat has been
something tremendous. For the past month Yes-
No has been a huge waistcoat crying up and down
the main street of Australia, and there is no
present sign of his stopping.
“ Nulla ” writes :
Re the recent Bulletin' query as to the possibility of
George Reid occasionally lapsing- into truthfulness. I rise
to remark that, in my opinion, barring accidents, it is not
possible. lam led to reply thus after reading- his speech
at the Bagmen’s Annual Gorge, wherein he stated, for the
17th or 117th (I’ve lost count lately) time, that “ when
Englishmen wanted to come into the country we put
them in gaol.” (Applause.) The “applause ” needs some
explanation. Possibly the faithful reporter put it in
unconsciously.
There’s only one really interesting fact
stressed in Senator Pulsford’s pamphlet, “ The
British Empire and the relations of Asia and
Australasia.” That is, that it was in 1897, when
G. H. Reid was Premier of N.S. Wales, that the
first Aliens Immigration Act on the lines of the
present Federal Act was brought forward. The
then Jap Consul protested, but, as Mr. Reid was
kept in office by the Labor party, he doesn’t seem
to have even replied to the protest.
The Commerce Bill, now before the Federal
House, will, if honestly and rigorously adminis-
tered, do much to purify commerce in Australia.
The importation of falsely-described goods is for-
bidden ; penalty £lOO and forfeiture of the goods.
This will stop such games as importing shoddy to
masquerade as Australian tweed. The export of
falsely-described goods is also forbidden (same
penalties), and this should do much to give Aus-
tralian exports an honest character.
When the Commonwealth statistics for
1904 came out, and showed that the trade done
between the States in articles of their own manu-
facture was £3,675,000 more than in 1899, the
Freetrade press rose with a tinkling cymbal in its
hand, and asked who wanted more Protection
when we were getting such splendid results al-
ready. But Australia requires more manufactures,
not merely an increased shifting about of the
scanty products of existing manufactures.
Chairman Bruce, of Melbourne Denton
hat mills, to his shareholders :—“ We produce the
best wool here, and our mill buys the best of that;
our machinery is identically the same as Italian
or English, and our workman are as good as the
best in any part of the world, yet there are
persons who persistently run down home-made
goods and run after and praise foreign shoddy.
But I have never noticed these people turn up
their noses at the sovereigns turned out by the
Melbourne or Sydney mints ! ”
Agent-General Coghlan of N.S.W. has
commenced to advertise his State in England,
and being a capable man his advertisement is
likely to bring forth fruit. Already there is talk
of a rush of immigrants to the State, and within
a year these immigrants will probably begin to
arrive. Then, unless N.S.W. has work for them
to do and land for them to settle on, within
18 months they will begin to go away again, and
they will probably go away using bad language.
To the artisan immigrant in almost every line of
business N.S.W. will have nothing to ssty except
that it has no work for him. All the things lie makes
are imported, mainly owing to the great exertions
of the N.S.W. contingent in the Australian Parlia-
ment to keep down the tariff for the benefit of
the importer. To the agricultural immigrant it
will say that it has practically no land to offer,
because its land-tax is carefully devised so as not
to break up the big estates and force the owners
to make room for small farmers. As for the
State’s lands, they seem to be reserved for the
land-agent. Very nearly the only thing N.S.W.
has to offer to its immigrants is space in which to
hold meetings and demonstrate round a certain
statue at the top of King-street, Sydney. The
other States are in much the same situation—in
fact, Australia in general will be in much the
same situation till it gets a new tariff and a
Federal graduated land-tax.
Glancing over an enlarged map of Vic-
toria, one is astonished at the huge slices into
which the Mallee has been cut
up. Dugald M'Pherson has
his name writ large across an
area of 547 square miles, and
just below him there is another
block of 1200 square miles
branded a special color and ear-
marked “ Lascelles.” Close by
a whole tribe of Carters have
spread their tents over a blood-
red field of some 1300 square
miles, but even this grab is
eclipsed by an aggressive person
named M‘Edward, who, after
threatening to paint the whole
continent a dirty brown, suddenly
drowns himself in the Murray just
as he is completing his 1490th
square mile. Settlement in the
Mallee perished almost before it
began. The huge land-grabber killed
it, while a huge fool of a Parliament looked on.
Thus “ Huffin Guffin ”
The debate on R. F. Toucher’s motion for the abolition
of the Victorian State Governor was chiefly remarkable
for the weakness of the arguments against the proposal.
All that M‘Cutcheon, Iceberg Irvine, Boyd and Co. could
say was that a State Governor “attracted population,”
and that the saving of £BOOO or £lO,OOO a year was
“paltry.” Irvine drew a terrible picture of the Speaker
leading the House to Tallbottle, and telling him that he
was useless and possibly not ornamental. The debate, so
far as the Tories were concerned, never got above that
level. The idea of Tallbottle “ attracting population ”
has prevented Victoria getting its regular sleep of late.
Mr. Hugh Nelson, as Queensland's Lieut. -
Governor, just before the announcement of
Downing-street’s latest appointment of a guber-
natorial rubber stamp, violently resented a
suggestion by Arthur Rutledge that a local man
would do well enough as State figure-head. He
said :
The Australian States should insist upon maintaining
the close and direct connection with their sovereign by
allowing His Majesty to appoint their Governors. To
have local men would be a national misfortune.
Well, some local men are a national misfortune—
Nelson for one. But Canada gets on well ‘enough
with local men for State Governors, and we are
always being told to “look at Canada.’’ It even-
gets on, as regards most of the provinces, with no
Upper Houses.
Last week it was proposed in the Repre-
sentatives by Spence, M.H.R., that a committee
of both Houses should be appointed
To make full inquiry as to the advisability of the
Federal Government owning and controlling a fleet of
steamers for the carriage of mails, passengers and cargo
between Australia and the United Kingdom.
But Premier Deakin and the Opposition leader,
renegade Joe Cook, were so alarmed at the pros-
pect of acquiring information on the subject that
between them they got it toned down into a mere
“inquiry as to the carriage of mails, passengers
and cargo between Australia and the United
Kingdom.” Yet it is hard to see that the
information which Spence proposed to gather
would have done any harm to Deakin, who likes
information, or to Cook, who needs it. Also,
Spence’s idea of a Federally-owned ocean service is
the shortest cut to the establishment of an
Australian-owned ocean service, and there is just
as much need for Australia to go on the sea as to
go on the land.
“ Coriander ” : Your par re the British
Army Council Committee’s report on
the war scandals (3/8/ 05) misses one
delicious point. Though Meyer bought
the fodder from the British army at a
low price, and then sold it back to the
army at a high price, he never took
delivery; it con-
tinued to remain
in the Government
stores (no storage
charge) and to be
issued by the
authorities just as
before. Meyer
merely drew the
profits, £2OOO per
day on oats alone !
And instead of
feeling pleased at
this instance of
Meyer’s faith in
the honesty of the
British Army, the
committee seems
hurt at it. But
worst of all is the
evidence of the
spread of Pro-
Boerism in the
British Army. The
committee-men, the
majority of them
officers, ask, “Are
the taxpayers of
this country to
continue to be
the sport of
the many ques-
tionable con-
tractors who -
are as ready
to follow their
several avoca-
tions in the wake
of a war as they are to he its pioneers ? ”
And in the next par. they speak of
“pantaloons in putties” and “harle-
quins in helmets.” Fancy this lan-
guage five short years ago !
Forty years ago women in Victoria exer-
cised the Parliamentary franchise. The Electoral
Act of 1803 provided that all persons on a rate-
payers’ roll of any municipal district should be
entitled to vote in the election of members of the
Assembly ; consequently many female ratepayers
had the franchise conferred upon them. And
according to all the reliable old Tories of to-day
the woman’s franchise period was a far better
time than this degenerate age.
Judge Burnside’s decision in the case (on
appeal) of oneNathooMahomed, convicted at Perth
police court of violating a clause of the Westralian
Factories Act relating to Asiatics, was historic-
ally correct and correct also in sentiment. Mahomed
claimed that he was not an Asiatic, inasmuch as,
although born in India, his parents were Turks.
The court held that, although the Turks have been
making a disgraceful mess of one corner of Europe
for some centuries, they originally came from
Asia, their empire is mostly in Asia, and Asiatics
they still are.
The Australian Parliament is also develop-
ing the pettifogging spirit that brings the State
Assemblies to the level of suburban municipal
councils. Not long since over an hour was wasted
debating whether a certain gunner in the artillery
should pay for some cabbages and sugar. Also, a
number of members fill the notice-paper with
questions as to why the postmistress of Barebones
Gully is to be deprived of her £2 per annum fuel
allowance, and other tremendous national matters.
In the meantime, trifles like the Tariff Commission
and Iron Bonus Bill are hung up to dry.
Last week the House of Peps, had its
usual yowl about the duty on harvesters, and the
principal cat on the roof was Lonsdale, the
N.S.W. Freetrader, who denounced the Aus-
tralian harvester-making industry as a “mono-
poly,” though there are several competing
firms in the business. As for the great Ameri-
can combine, which holds the agricultural
machinery business of all the U.S. and Canada,
and makes no secret of its intention to get that of
all the world—well, Lonsdale never calls it a
monopoly. All the sour abuse of the unpatriotic
shoddy gang is reserved for the Australian manu-
facturer.
Why all this amazing row about the
raising of the invoice price of imported harvesters,
and all this fearsome riot about the Commerce
Bill? The Australian manufacturer has to work
under restrictions—he has to keep decent condi-
tions in his factories, and to pay legal wages ; yet
the whole moan of the Argus, the D.T., and
Courier, is about the troubles of the poor im-
porter. His goods may be manufactured under
the vilest conditions ; he may be the agent of the
blackest of sweaters, and nobody says him nay ;
but directly Australia insists that at least his
goods shall be sent into competition with the
local maker’s on even terms, the whole tribe of
shoddy and mungo is in an uproar.
Mrs. Barrington, boss. agitator in Mel-
bourne for the trumpery Tory Australian Women’s
National League, angrily deplores the absence of
young people from the dreary functions of the
league. “ The old people support us, but the
young ones turn away almost unanimously. All
over the country the young people seem to be out
of sympathy with the league’s ideals.” The league
is a hen convention, and an old hen convention at
that, and one does not know how dull politics can
be till he hears them cackle in the barnyard. No
doubt the young women who despise the ideals of
the portly matrons of the league are better em-
ployed with their own ideals, which are taller and
slimmer and not so profusely overgrown with
whiskers.
N.S.W. Public Instruction Department
has made a belated start with an experiment in
centralising the schools. The humpies in some
thinly-peopled wilds round Penrith—which is the
electorate of the Minister for Public Instruction—
where a few children wrestle for knowledge in an
unsuitable building under a teacher who is often
soured by the misfortune of being there, are to be
abolished, and the children are to be driven in
Socialistic sociables to the Superior Public School
at Penrith. This, by the way, is an idea which
has been long in practice in some of the
wilder parts of Victoria. The Carruthers Minis-
try, which was to put a firm foot down on Social-
ism, professes to be hugely proud of the Socialist
sociable.

Many observers have noticed how the pro-
gressive evsolution of States and the consumption
of D.C.L. whisky run in parallel upward courses.
Since the consumption of that inspiring beverage
has become so general in Australia, some bright
and progressive legislation should arrive very
quickly. D.C.L. in well-ordered array means the
well ordered advance of the community.*
A HEAVY GAMBLE.
PASENGER : “ What’s good for seasickness?”
STEWARD : “ They say champagne is a good thing,:
sir.”
PASSENGER : " Oh, hut champagne is such expen-
sive stuff to risk.”
“ Kaipara ” : All over Maoriland the grave
of the liquor traffic is opening. Methodists and
sundry other enthusiasts set the ball rolling;.
many people give it a kick out of hatred for the
brewers ; the army of prohibited persons (nearly
100 orders have been issued in one town with a
population of only 800), being ordered to abstain
themselves, think that others should do likewise;
and the woman voter is almost unanimous. “No-
License ” is expected to be carried in the four big
towns, and in quite a number of country
electorates, and National Prohibition looks only
another election or two off.
Brigadier-General Gordon caused a good 1
number of people to become angry by his state-
ment that “it made him sick when he saw 30,000
people loafing on a rail cheering during the course
of a football match,” while it was so hard to in-
terest the public in the defence and progress
and general well-being of the country. Yet
it is difficult to see where anybody has cause
to grumble, unless it be about the absurdity of
Gordon’s idea that 30,000 people can loaf on one
rail. A discussion is now going on as to whether
he alluded to 30,000 people loafing on a rail or
30,000 loafers on a rail, but it doesn’t seem to
matter much which he said. Either way it was am
interesting remark and a very much over-loaded;
rail.
Sydney Telegraph, arguing against the
employment of Savings Bank deposits for State
Bank purposes, Says
The advances system having- proved sound elsewhere,
there ought to be no need for the Government to finance
it in this country with money belonging to people who
have not been consulted in the matter.
Which is a specially violent inversion of the
truth, for the people are consulted in this matter
more than in almost any other item of legislation.
First, the depositors, and also the people who are
not depositors, are consulted in the usual way by
the matter being submitted to their representa-
tives in Parliament. Secondly, every individual:
depositor is separately consulted by being allowed
to withdraw his money if he doesn’t approve of
the use it is proposed to make of it. Not one-
penny of anybody’s money will be used without
that person being consulted twice over.
The stereotyped Tory has curious ideas
about “fair play.” When the Tasmanian Licensing
Bill came up in the Assembly last week the
Attorney-General moved its rejection, because
“it aimed at giving power to the people to close
licensed houses without compensation, which was
opposed to British fair play and justice.” The
ordinary conception of British fair play generally
consists in swindling the community for the benefit
of the_ individual; it never seems to take account
of giving the State a fair deal. The State, by its
licensing system, gives the publican, on certain
terms, the right to sell liquor for one year. It
pledges itself to no more and no less. When the ■
State refuses to renew the agreement, as it has a
perfect right to do, the publican wants compensa-
tion for giving up a vested interest which never
was vested except by his own cheeky assumption,
and the common idea of British fair play consists -
in robbing the community for the publican’s bene-
fit. Blow British fair play !

Last week the High Court, assisted by five learned
barristers and sundry solicitors, considered the
weariful case of Ah Yick, and told Vic. minor
Judge Johnston that he was wrong in refusing to
hear that Chop’s appeal. Ah Yick originally
came to Sydney early in 1904, but was held to be
an undesirable immigrant and told to return
whence he cam®. Instead, he fled to Victoria,
where he was captured and sentenced to 14 days
hard labor, pending deportation. This was 11
months ago. He appealed to Judge Johnston,
who didn’t think he had jurisdiction ; then he
went to the High Court. All this 1 1 me he has
been a eomijnon gardener growing cabbage and
lettuce in tile Goulburn Valley, yet m his two
appeals he b ( as managed to retain the servicesi of a
couple of expensive barristers and some far from
economical* solicitors. Evidently there must be
great profit in the cabbage-growing industry, or
; great to find out what the Stinking lish
party does with its money.
There] are further -developments in con-
nection 'Wfiy the row between G. Roberts, ex-
Labor M xj.A., and Melbourne Trades Hall
/Roberts, it was alleged, had, as auditor,
trefusydcTo sign the council’s balance-sheet until
:'£l3 hiad been accounted for or made good, So tar
:as malking good any £l3 is concerned, the council s
treasurer has made a statutory declaration that
the Ye never has been any shortage ; and Roberts
fefiow-auditor has also made a declaration that
the yam about £l3 is a “pure invention and
wholly untrue.” Every £l3 spent has to be
accounted for, of course; but the council makes
its affidavit that there hasn’t been any trouble to
account for any particular £l3. A side issue is as
to why Roberts was expelled from the council, bo
far astheauditorshipis concerned, he went out, no
doubt, simply because he was only elected tor one
audit; as to his membership, the council s conten-
tion is that he was thrown out, not for taking up
Lauder’s charges against the management of phe
Tocsin, but for “ defying the council, and holding
it up to contempt after the charges had been
patiently investigated and proved to be malicious
and unfounded.” So far as the financial matter is
concerned, the council, which handles considerable
funds, might strengthen its position at all times ii
its audits were made by a professional outsider.
Bank commission £10,796 7s. Id., for
handing out old age pensions, was paid last year
by N S.W. Government. The Reform Govern-
ment has allowed this waste to increase by a few
pounds, instead of practically wiping out the
charge, as it might have done, by distributing the
pensions through the Savings Bank.

. While the Queensland Lands Department
is obliged to revoke timber reserves and hunt
round for suitable areas with which to meet the
demand for settlement, there are miles of
alienated scrub lands, practically unimproved and
quite unused, in the richest part of the North
Coast. Some of this country was originally taken
up by bonafide settlers, afterwards squeezed out;
s ° m ® °f d was dummied, and eventually fell into
the hands of monopolists, who are waiting for the
Tif 6 scarcity must bring. One selector in
the Nambour district says he can see from his
farm 25,000 acres of land, all unimproved, which
the land monopolist keeps for the purpose of
breeding vermin and weed pests.

Spielers, sneak-thieves, and the miscel-
laneous brotherhood of sharpers in Melbourne are
kicking themselves for what they missed through
being elsewhere, the other day, when £7OO in
bank-notes broke loose in Flinders-lane, near
Swanston-street, and blew all over the place like
autumn leaves. A clerk in the employ of the Gas
co. let the money loose from a handbag, and a
fierce wind did the rest. The notes were so scat-
tered that one fiver was subsequently found on
the cathedral roof. Only two notes are still miss-
ing, and probably they are also on roofs.

If you want to know how much Socialism
there is in Maoriland, ask a postmaster. He
knows better even than a policeman. Practically
every township has a post-office ; and in Maori-
land, under R. Seddon and J. Ward, where there’s
a post-office there’s also a State bank and a State
agent-general. When a farmer wants to pay up
an instalment under the Advances to Settlers Act
he can do it when he gets to the post-office ; last
year £447,397 was paid in this way, and the
department paid out £451,799 in the same fashion.
The same with the old-age pensions; the post-
office distributed £196,322, and saved the country
some of the lump of money that N.S. Wales pays
a private concern for doing the work. And when
he isn’t handing out the patent pill circular, or
an old-age pension, or an advance to a settler, he
is doing a stroke for the Public Trustee (nearly a
million passed through the post-offices for this
department in the last 12 months), or for the
Government Insurance Department, or he is sell-
ing 4 per cent, debentures for the Treasury, or
collecting fishing licenses, or tourist fees, or game
licenses, or income-tax, or something of the sort.

Dr. Sydney Jamieson points out, in the
last Victorian Year Book, a few of the results of
interfering with Private Enterprise. In l£8)-2
232 Melbourne people died from phthisis out of
every 100,000 of them; but step by step that
record has been brought down to 146 per 100,000 —
“due mainly” says the doctor, “to general
measures of improved sanitation, but, above all,
to more general recognition of the benefits to be
got from good lighting and ventilation, both in
private dwellings, and in factories, workshops,
and offices.” Yet Melbourne figures still show
up badly compared with those of many cities of
Europe ‘and America, chiefly, as the city health
officer admits, because Melbourne hasn’t inter-
fered with Private Enterprise to the same
extent—it has preferred to die rather than clip
the claws of its pet fetish as close as they are
clipped elsewhere. Also, Melbourne’s infant
mortality has been fined down from 177‘9 per
1000 births in 1873-5 to 92'7 per 1000 last year ;
while the mortality from typhoid, which was 65
per 100,000 of the population in 1870-2, has been
gradually brought to 16, practically the whole of
it through Socialistic enterprise of some sort or
other—deep drainage, dairy inspection, etc. The
one sweeping disease, in fact, with which Inter-
ference with Private Enterprise hasn’t grappled
with more or less success is cancer; the increase in
deaths of the middle-aged and old from that goes
on continuously, and Medicine wrings its hands,
in something very like shame, and says that it
doesn’t know definitely what to recommend.

Readers of “Situations Vacant ” in Mel-
bourne Age have been puzzling their brains as to
the meaning of the following lengthy ad.
LADY, R.C., with superior class ideas, would confer
a great favor on the parent of a truly good moral
Girl, 29 years of age, a native of Dublin, not three
years in Australia. She is obliged to seek such a lady
through no fault of her own, but by domestic
affliction and misplaced confidence ; no idea of laun-
dress or cooking, plainly educated, with a little
knowledge of music. A little time with such a lady
and she might consider her a boon, and a most trust-
worthy member of her household. Hotels and com-
mercial replies not entertained.

Cohentingentism has now come to be
pleaded not merely as an excuse but as a reason
for crime. In an English case of cruelty to a pony
(Birmingham Post of June 5) prisoner’s counsel
said “there would be no attempt at a defence,
but he pleaded that the prisoner was not respon-
sible for his actions. He was one of those un-
fortunate individuals who suffered from going out.
to South Africa.” Nothing was said of his having
been wounded or sunstruck, so it seems that the
farm-burning business is now understood to be a
cause of miscellaneous iniquity.

As an additional fly in an ointment that
has always been mostly fly, the fair charmers on
the Sydney streets have been to a great extent
harried off them by police authority. The direct
consequence is that Flo now lurches in the halo of
the suburban lamp-post instead of the city electric
glow, and has spread herself considerably about
suburban thoroughfares. Another direct conse-
quence is that the police are delayed on their long
beatswhile shifting the lady further along—delayed
so much that, t’other night, some burglars were
caught red-handed when, according to their calcu-
lations, the punctual foot of the law had passed
half-an-hour previously.
The Monkey Man from Inside.
“ Verax,” who as a chief engineer has had much
practical experience of him, throws more light
upon our ally :
A few facts to help Spruce Myth next time he brings
his Japanese Admission Act before the Commonwealth
Houses.
Was in Japanese Transport Service for five months, and
remarked to an officer that Japan would have enough
soldiers for a long while, pointing to the gangs of coolies
loading the ship. “No,” he replied, “we would never
dare to send those men to the front. In battle, when
their blood got heated, they would surely murder the
wounded.”
A British engineer in Nippon Yushen Kaisha employ
went into the stokehold to ask for more steam, and was
attacked by six firemen on watch, and retired to the
engine-room with a broken arm. Within a week, at
Hakodate, another engineer was put in hospital minus
an eye, the result of an argument with his Jap subor-
dinates. The lower classes have only a veneer Of civilisa-
tion skin-deep. Women, with children on their backs,
work coal and cargo, and have as much modesty as an
animal. Have frequently seen them settle an argument
with coal hoes.
In Yokohama one day the police raided the ship and
ran in 20 coolies for being dressed in their natal clothes.
They might easily have had 50; but bj r the time they had
raked in their catch the remainder had knotted their
laid-aside 3ft. of cloth round their centre and were
dressed. Skilled mechanics get Is. 6d. per day, and are
as good workmen as our own. Laborers get sd. a day
and a meal of Jib. of rice and a strip of dried fish and
water in the middle of their working day of 11 hours.
Captain and chief engineers of their mercantile navy get
£7 and £8 per month. Perhaps this accounts for their
unreliableness. Hardly ten miles of Japanese coast but
lias a wreck as landmark, and not a white skipper can be
got up there who will venture near a Jap ship unless
necessary. Have been in Moji dozens of times, and never
lay there once but a serious shipping accident of some
sort happened as a result of their foolhardiness.
One of the leading European firms in Kobe booked an
order for dress-stuffs from a Japanese firm. The
goods came to hand, and a request was sent to
take delivery. This the Jap firm refused to do,
and the white firm entered an action against them.
Expert evidence proved that the goods were in every
way up to sample. Defendants, pressed for reason
of refusal of goods, advanced the plea that the label on
the outside of package was of different color from that on
the sample. Verdict for plaintiffs. A meeting of Jap
merchants was then held ; they resolved to boycott the
British firm if they pressed the verdict, so no action was
taken.
Have frequently, when taking coal aboard ship, had to
send lighter after lighter away for not being up to sample.
Not only that, have sent them away half-empty, as they
tried to ring lighters in with only a foot of good coal on
top and muck underneath. Then when it comes to
measuring up and settling bills, the coal merchant has
invariably 20 per cent, more coal on the bill than he
actually put in the ship. They have a stiff income-tax
in Japan, and a Jap official inspects the books of European
firms annually, and the white firms complain that the
information thus gained is distributed to the Jap firms
for their use. All the leading banks and firms in Japan
(Jap and white) employ Chinese shroffs or clerks. Is this
because the Jap is conspicuously dishonest ? The Chinee is
not a cheaper workman.
At every port you touch in Japan you are inspected by
health officers, although your last port was only twelve
hours away. Went ashore in Moji with a companion one
day for a stroll; hadn’t been ten minutes ashore, when
we were joined by two Jap officers, who accompanied us
everywhere, directing our footsteps with unfailing polite-
ness. Their system of espionage is complete and annoy-
ing. Japan may not have an Aliens Restriction Act, but
it yet manages to make foreigners so happy that, with all
our immigration laws, there are a thousand more Japs in
Australia than there are British in Japan. Then, as to
freedom. Three papers in four months were suppressed
for being Socialistic and for criticising the policy of the
Government.
About the State tobacco monopoly. The first year’s
operations resulted in a profit of 20,000,000 yen. The
tobacco was undoubtedly better, and the sale of rubbish
was stopped. Yet the price of, say, cigarettes increased
only from 5 to 6 sen (ljd. to ljd.) per packet of ten.
The mining industry is in the hands of the Government,
and no concessions are allowed to foreigners. A foreigner
cannot own land. He does so virtually by taking a Jap
wife (£lO to £2O), and buying land and registering it in
her name. A Jap wife waits hand-and-foot on her hus-
band, and follows him about like a dog. Some of the
Australian ladies’leagues which now admire the Japs so
much might just think how they would like to mate their
daughters on these conditions.
Was talking to the Superintendent of Police at
Am 03- —a man who could read and talk Chinese like a
native, and who, when in the detective force at Shanghai,
had travelled the length and breadth of China on
secret missions, and had been through the Boxer and
other rebellions. Asked him his opinion on the Yellow
Peril. He said it was no chimera of a diseased
mind, but an actual living, growing thing. Japan was
educating and exploiting China on all hands, and China
was awakening. In three months no fewer than forty
new vernacular papers came to life, and that in a country
where, a year before, they could have been reckoned on
che fingers of one hand. The Japanese universities and
schools are also full of Chinese students.
Our Rotting Industries.
“G.H.”: Australia is littered with industries
that only require a decent tariff to send them
ahead. Visited the Marbut wood-carving works,
Melbourne, the other day. This industry operates
a machine that does all manner of patterned wood-
carving and embellishing, and cuts the stuff out as
clean as a sparrow-chirp. The present tariff only
gives 20 per cent. Protection, however, and the
local market is swamped with pressed composition
mouldings from Germany and the U. S. The Marbut
industry is purely Australian. It uses nothing but
Australian "woods—kauri, Moreton Bay pine, red
cedar, quandong, pencil cedar, silky oak, &e. The
American pressed mouldings have a blurred, im-
Eerfect outline, but the Marbut moulds—cut out
y chucks—are pie. The manager told me that 50
fresh hands could start if a prohibitive tariff
were aimed at the shoddy imported mouldings.
Went down to the Victorian Rolling mills,
West Melbourne, afterwards. They roll main-
wheel rims for reapers and binders —under their
own patent—and export the flat bars to America.
The Yank works the plates into rims, attaches
the other parts of the binder, humps the lot back
to the Commonwealth, and sells the complete
machine to the fool Australian at a huge profit.
The Australian had brains enough to devise the
patent rim (a transverse ridge is rolled on the bar,
formerly it was rivetted on), but he hasn’t sense
enough to keep his own market for the sale of his
owninvention. Heleaves that to the cute American,
and speaks violently to any person who dares to
tell him that he is eight .assorted kinds of idiot.
Some splendid machinery is rusting away at the
V.R. Mills. Dog-spike machines, rivet-making
machines, bolt-making machines, nut-making
machines, lathes, planers, milling-machines—all
rotting for want of work. Manager Egerton
says the day the tariff goes up 100 men can start
in on a permanent job. And the Federal Labor
Conference—which is supposed to represent the
amalgamated political genius of Australia —has
resolved to keep on sinking the fiscal issue and
letting the works rot, and the 100 men stay idle,
■or get a job at shifting sand.
The Iron Need.
Practically all parties in the Commonwealth
agree that Australia needs an iron industry; there
is difference only as to how it should come. The
Freetrader, as G. H. Reid explained with injuri-
ous frankness once, looks forward to the time
when wages will be so low in Australia that suc-
cessful competition with cheap labor countries will
be made possible. The Laborite favors an iron
industry, provided that it is in the hands of the
State. The Protectionist calls for bonus and tariff
provision which will establish iron mills at once,
and if he is a democrat—as most Protectionists
are—is prepared to make tariff and bonus condi-
tional on a fair wage rate being paid. Of the
three methods, the first is not worth discussing.
The Australian ideal has been, from the first, to
make this a country of high wages and of
social and economic equality as far as possible.
What makes Australia dear to its citizens—the
general contempt of caste and class distinc-
tions, the broad acceptance of the Revolution’s
triology, Liberty, Fraternity, Equality—would
vanish once the continent became a low-wage
country. Differences of food, of clothing, of edu-
cation, of living, would be sharpened, and the
path cleared for the coming of the old-world con-
ventions, which rest primarily on the economic
oppression of the worker. An iron industry under
Freetrade conditions Australia does not therefore
want —not, at any rate, whilst there remains the
shadow of a hope of obtaining it on other terms.
The Laborites’ method, were it feasible, would be
certainly the best. The iron industry, to be
AT THE TIVOLI.—A POSER.
SMALL GIRL (indicating the statue of Milo on the stage): “Ma would you look like that if
they put you on a pedestal ?”
successful, must be a big affair, and carried on
under conditions of concentration. For a Govern-
ment —either of the Commonwealth or of one of
the States—to have direct control would be the
safest guard against any unfair exploitation of the
consumer or of the workers engaged. But there
does not seem an v reasonable hope of a State iron
industry. New South Wales is practically the
only mainland State in a position to found
ironworks, and it steadily refuses to entertain
the idea. In any case, only a highly organised
State, well accustomed to Socialistic enterprises,
and in thorough sympathy with the ideal of
collectivism, would have much prospect of build-
ing up a successful iron industry. In any case
the State’s iron industry, so far as it attempted
to supply the public, would have no more chance
against foreign competition under Freetrade con-
ditions than anyone’s else iron industry. (To
nationalise an iron industry after it had once been
successfully set going would be quite a different
and a much easier matter.) And as it happens
there is not on the scene in New South Wales,
and is not likely to be for some time, an honest
Government sympathetic with Socialism. The
Laborite dictum of “No iron industry except on
Socialist lines” is practically, therefore, an em-
bargo on any iron industry at all, until such time,
mayhap, as the Japanese establish it here. It is
only from the Protectionist method that Aus-
tralia can hope for success in this matter. The
Bulletin hopes that the Labor party in the Aus-
tralian Parliament will come to see this. The
times are exigent. Australia cannot be sure
of immunity from attack for another five,
perhaps not even for another two years.
At present the continent is as helpless as an old
wooden ship would be when faced by a modern
ironclad. It should buckle on its armor with all
speed, and the first greave should be an iron-mill
to turn out the raw material of ploughs and guns
and swords and ships and railways. If time
allowed, an exhaustive discussion as to the very
best method of setting the iron-mills rolling
might be desirable. But time does not allow.
Something has to be done at once. Let the
industry be established, and the academic dis-
cussion as to the best way of controlling it can be
indulged in afterwards. The Labor party will
take a responsibility which may haunt its mem-
bers hereafter if they stand in the way of this
great national need for the sake of making— at
some future date about which they seem to be in
no haste —an experiment in Socialism.
If Not Arbitration.
Do the Tories seriously think that if the Arbitra-
tion Act and other such legislation designed to
shield the worker against the sweater were
abolished, the matter would end there ? _ Ap-
parently they do. But the assumption is an
entirely absurd one. The workers form the bulk
of the community. They have the most votes at
the ballot, and the most hands if politics came
down to what is the ultimate basis of all rule,
fighting. Their condition has been, ever since
the dawn of the industrial epoch in civilisation’s
history, most miserable. Not for them were fine
clothing, good food, the romance of love, the full
pride of children. Their garments were mean
and dirty, their food coarse, their wives branded
harshly with the stamp of toil like themselves. Their
children were “ hands,” to be set to work as soon
as possible to help in gathering to-day’s food to
make possible the work of to-morrow, so that
there might be food for the work of the day after.
Art, music, letters were as far from them as
Paradise. Little by little they have improved
their lot until to-day they have come to the stage
at which the hardest work of the world is no
longer rewarded with the barest of living wages,
and the manual laborer and artisan can see dimly
a little of the glory of the earth, can understand
something further than eating a little, working a
great deal, and sleeping as little as possible. The
worker, with the help of Labor legislation, begins
to find himself on a path which suggests hope.
Is it reasonable to think that, if the Tory
blocks that path, the worker will turn quietly
back, to descend again into the old misery ?
Or is it not rather of certainties most cer-
tain that, barred from one path, he will still
seek in another way the Something Better which
he now knows to be possible ? In countries
where there is no “ Labor legislation,” no Social-
istic interference with the sacred rights of Private
Enterprise, the worker struggles on to his dimly-
seen goal with strikes, riots, outrages, bombs.
Should the Australian Tory succeed in winning
an effective political supremacy, Mr. Bbuce Smith
would have to promulgate his platform from a
steel casement. Those who do the hardest of the
world’s work have caught a glimpse of the light
ahead, and are resolved to reach to it, peacefully,
if possible, but they are resolved to reach to it
somehow. Arbitration is better than dynamite.
“ J.Y.” from the Pig Island of Maoriland :
Met, the other day, in a town in the Forty-Mile Bush,
an acquaintance whom I had not seen for 16 years.
Maoriland’s large Premier was addressing the electors in
the local town hall on the same evening, and I suggested
we should go and hear Seddon. My acquaintance imme-
diately had a series of explosions, in which Seddon and
had English were freely mixed. The circus concluded
with a desire that he would live to see “Seddon hung.”
Later on got some of his past career. He told me that 10
years ago he was on the rocks in Christchurch, and had
come unpleasantly close to starvation for his wife and
himself. By telling a fair-sized lie (that he had work to
go to in the North Island), he induced a sympathetic
Government Labor Bureau to pay his train fare from
Christchurch to Lyttelton, also his steamer passage from
that port to Wellington, then his train fare from Welling-
ton to Pahiatua (about 90 miles inland), where, thanks
to the fraud he had so successfully worked, he found
employment. Since that time he has been fortunate,
and now holds a 200-acre lease in perpetuity. He is fairly
on his feet, and starvation is not within many miles of
him. Seddon’s Government initiated the Labor Bureau
that shifted him from a hand-to-mouth existence in
Christchurch to a place where work was plentiful.
Seddon’s Government invented the form of tenure under
which a man can start farming almost without capital.
Also Seddon’s Government created the State Land Bank,
which finances the small, impecunious farmer. And this
individual wanted to see Seddon hung because he wouldn’t
give away the freehold, also because of his Socialistic
policy. If Seddon had given away the freehold ten years
ago, and had had no Socialistic policy, this individual
might have gone on starving in Christchurch ; and he is
a very fair sample of the ungrateful crowd which is now
barking at its aged benefactor.

Drive the Poisons out of the Blood by
Taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Eczema is the outcome of ever-heated blood
heavily charged with' foreign matter, causing the
skin to become hot and dry. The arms and legs
become swollen and inflamed, causing irritation
almost beyond control. The skin cracks and
breaks and sores appear on the face and body.
The only remedy is to cleanse the blood, to remove
the impurities by the aid of the liver. Blood
diseases must be removed through the stomach,
superficial applications will never purify the blood.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood-
purifier. They accelerate the action of the liver
and kidneys, which drive out impurities, aid diges-
tion, and nourish the blood. They are a positive
and permanent cure for biliousness, indigestion,
constipation, headaches, sallow complexion, liver
and kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils and
blotches, and for female ailments.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The scratching of York for the Caulfield G.N.
Steeplechase seems to have been one of the unpleasant
results of Tatt.’s sweep. Tatt. had a sweep on the
Hurdle Race run at Adelaide on the same day as the
Caulfield event, and the drawer of the York ticket got
the owner with an offer of “£3OOO to nothing” to send
the horse to Adelaide. Which means that if there had
also been a sweep on the Caulfield Steeple the drawer of
the York ticket in that would have needed to offer terms
as good as or better than the other fellow to get the
chance of a run for his ticket. Subscribers to Tatt.
dream of winning the whole of the prize due to the
drawer of either of the three luckiest numbers. They
reckon without the owner who, in too many cases, gets a
lot of gilt off the gingerbread. And it isn’t as though he
had any legitimate claim against the sweep. It doesn’t
“ step in and spoil the market for him,” as is done by an
unauthorised big backer of his horse. The sweep in itself
doesn’t affect the financial interests of owners, neverthe-
less a considerable percentage of the prize money is
absorbed by them every year. The public would be
better served by a limited number of lotteries drawn
without reference to horse races. The one Melb. Cup
sweep drawn on the morning of the race is practically a
lottery, in so far that the drawers of horse tickets are
mostly—if not all —unaware of their chances until the
exact value of each chance has been decided.

York’s triumph in Adelaide G.N. Hurdles, on
Saturday last, was brilliant. He flashed over the 2| miles
in 4.52 J, and soared over the obstacles like a bird. At
five furlongs from home the more lightly-burdened Moss
Deer came like the wind ; but York’s jockey roused his
mount to a final effort, and left the wind and Moss Deer
behind. York’s gathering of three Grand Nationals in
succession is a record.

With York away at Adelaide, engaged in win-
ning the Hurdle Race, there was nothing to stop Beilis
from doing the Steeplechase trick at Caulfield last Satur-
day. The racehorse won in a canter, Find Out (another
son of Lochiel) coming nearest to his half-brother. This
season’s record for the big jumping races is unique.
York has won the G.N. Hurdle Races at Flemington,
Caulfield, and Adelaide, and Beilis has taken the Steeple-
chase “ double.” For the present, the common name of
the Victorian jumpers is “ Mud ’’—merely “Mud.” They
are not in it with the best cattle from other States.
Previous winners of double and treble events were owned
in the State which claimed an unassailable supremacy
for its leppers, but this York-Bellis success is a complete
triumph of foreign competition. Beilis covered the
Caulfield journey in 8.3 J, or 4sec. faster than the previous
record, and from 12 to 42sec. better than the time credited
to the heavier weights—Colonel Shilinski, Domino,
Daimio, and Redleap—who won over the same four-miles
course. The best of old-fashioned breeds of horses for
jumping purposes are no longer good enough to swear
by. The big Steeplechase nowadays is for the swift and
clever rather than for the sure and sturdy animals that
seem to be kept going in Victoria, on the chance of
picking up small stakes at the minor meetings, where
jumping events are much too frequent.

Ancient Freedom, killed in V.A.T.C.’s G.N.
Steeple, was just on 12 years old, a game nag, and a
mighty lepper. Owner had decided that Saturday’s race
should be his last—and then the Elysian clover fields of
old age. But he came down on top of his stable chum
Orlando at the final fence, after a gallant struggle across
four miles of “ country.” Until he fell he had every
chance of proving a winner. If there are stables in the
next-world fields of asphodel, Freedom should have a
first-class stall.

“0.K.” : Avery droll variety of Tatt.’s Sweep
law-suit (I forget how it ended) was introduced into the
Melbourne County Court the other week. Plaintiff John
Gill was one of a syndicate whose ticket drew a £9O prize
in a sweep. A draft for that amount was sent from
Hobart, but the postman delivered it at the house of
another John Gill, living in the same suburb as his syndi-
cated namesake. Well, the John Gill who got the draft
was an old subscriber to “ Tatt.’s,” he says, and when the
draft came to hand he simply accepted it thankfully,
without going into details. He thought he had a right to
anything he could recover from the absorbent sweep
treasury, so he cashed the draft and enjoyed a good time
on the £9O. If his moral claim to the windfall was not
satisfactory the defendant Gill begged to fall back upon
the contention that Tatt.’s is an illegal business under
Common wealth law, consequently the misdelivered money
was not recoverable from him by legal process. Defendant
Gill has my heartfelt sympathy, assuming, of course, that
he is really an old contributor to the Tatt. lottery. A
ticket purchaser backs himself to get what he can for his
money. He is looking for good luck. In this case the
allotment of gambling luck between the two Gills was a
further matter of chance, depending on the action of a
disinterested postman. All things considered either Gill
would have been entitled to the other Gill’s luck, but only
one Gill could get it.

Saturday was an inter-State football day under
Australian rules, and the Cornstalk teams were beaten in
Brisbane and Melbourne sinultaneously. In Brisbane cli-
matic conditions were just perfect, but the winter race
meeting happened along and absorbed most of the public
interest. Australian football doesn’t look as dangerous
as it really is, while Rugby looks much more so than
practice proves it to be, and people always love that
which looks deadly. The Cornstalks in Brisbane made a
much better showing than those who went to Melbourne.
At half time the Bananalanders were only one point
ahead, and half-way through the last quarter (these
fractions sound mixed, but aren’t!) N.SAV. was actually
leading by a couple of points. But the Bananalanders
pulled themselves together, and brushed up their com-
bination. N.S.W. hadn’t another ounce to spare—it was
all out; and right on the finish of the game Queensland
went ahead and won by 15 points, the score being 10
goals 16 behinds to 9 goals and 7 behinds.
Last Saturday, for the first time in 24 years,
a N.S. Wales team was in Melbourne to play Victoria at
football—and unless there is a vast improvement the con-
tests might almost as well lapse for another quarter-cen-
tury. Of the eight Victorian League clubs Gollingwood
was away at Broken Hill, Fitzroy at Bendigo, Essendon in
Tasmania, Melbourne in Gippsland, and Geelong fooling
round the Western district. The best of the players
left had gone to fight the return battle against
Ballarat—where, by the way, they were beaten
by 72 to 52 points—so the team that met N.S.W. was
something of a remnant. Yet the game speedily became
a joyous farce. Within 10 minutes of starting the Vies.,
having scored 2 goals 5 behinds to nil, had got the measure
of their victims, and thenceforward took things easily.
First quarter showed a tally of 24 points to 2 ; second 51
to 22 ; then the dark blues eased up and the visitors
notched 59 points to 64. In the last quarter the
Victorians kicked three goals in five minutes and the
bell saw their score 12 goals 18 behinds to N.S.W.
10 goals 10 behinds. In eyery phase of the
game the light blues were outplayed—in kicking,
marking',and passing, in speed and in cleverness. And,
worst of all, they had absolutely no system whatever.
That of the Victorians was none too good—the 18 had
been drawn from half-a-dozen different clubs —but the
Walers had not the remotest idea of playing to one
another. Weather was showery, ground slippery, and
attendance poor—about 6000 or 7000. Before the mat ch
the State school kiddies from north and south of the Yarra
gave a good exposition of Australian football as it should
be played—a fast, open and unselfish game —wherein the
democratic North Yarra lads, smaller but quicker than
the South-siders, won by 15 points to 14. A noticeable
feature about the schoolboys’ games is the unselfish play
and the almost entire absence of penalty kicks.

The Victoria-S. Australian inter-State football
match (Australian rules), at Adelaide, came within an ace
of being won by the weaker side. Victoria had only its
Association, not its League, 18 in the field, and the Crow-
eaters outclassed the Gumsuckers in everything but judg-
ment. Victoria kept one reliable goal-kicker about 15yd.
from the S. Australian goal-line (there is no off-side in the
Australian game), and the defence left him unmarked and
unhampered behind them. Result— a simple goal when-
ever a long kick went over the S. Australian heads. The
final score was S.A. 7 goals 12 behinds, Victoria 7 goals 9
behinds—and that one man made five of Victoria’s seven
straight shots.

Sydney Soccer football doesn’t exactly know its
present address. Pyrmont and Rozelle are dead level at
the top of the premiership-list, with 18 points each, and
Glebe is in second place with 17. Ultimo and Balmain
are 12 and 10 respectively; Sydney 6, Granville 3, and
South Sydney flies the product of the fowl. But Pyrmont
and Rozelle match has to be played over again ; likewise
that of Balmain and South Sydney. The latter doesn’t
matter a capsized benediction, but the first is important
—it may upset things. On Saturday, Glebe downed
Granville by 6 to nil. Granville threatened danger con-
tinually, but somehow, always missed just by a hair’s
breadth, and in the end was soundly beaten. Pyrmont
and Balmain played an exciting game, which at half-time
was dead level with one goal each. A successful dribbling
charge in the second half scored another goal for Pyrmont,
and, after that, things were so evenly balanced that the
game swayed up and down the ground till time ran out,
neither side able to score. So Pyrmont won by 2 to 1.

The progress of Queensland in the inter-State
Rugby this season has been a rapid descent from bad to
much worse. The first match against N.S.W. at Brisbane
saw the Northern team win by the narrow margin of -two
points—scores, 8 to 6. But the following Saturday
N.S.W. turned the tables, and won decisively by 12 points
(15 to 3). Then came the debacle at Sydney Cricket
Ground week before last when the Crocodiles went under
by 15 points—N.S.W. 24, Bananaland 9. A drawn game
with the Sydney Metropolitan team on the Wednesday
raised hopes of a more equal struggle at the return
match against N.S.W. last Saturday, but when that
day came the Crocodiles went one point more to the bad
and lost by 16 points—N.S.W., 22 ; Bananaland, 6. The
Cornstalk pack was better; it played well together, and
smothered every attempt to get the ball out. The
Queenslanders waited for opportunities to come, the
Cornstalks were raging round all the time making oppor-
tunities. There was a lack of harmony between
the back and front divisions of the Queensland
team. They did not apparently know of each other’s
existence at the start; the smothering tactics of the
Cornstalks gave them little chance to get introduced, and
at the end of the game they were strangers yet.
As on the previous Saturday, notwithstanding
the presence of the Queensland inter-State team at Sydney
Cricket Ground, the Metropolitan First Grade Rugby
competition continued. Glebe got its caudal appendage
perpendicular once more, being drawn against the ex-
hausted Eastern Suburbs. Strange to say, at the opening
of the game, the Suburbs pressed Glebe very hard, and
barrackers held their breath and wondered if something
was going to happen. Then the men from the abattoirs
got their heads down and trampled over everything,
winning by 28 to 5. The interesting match of the day was
that of South Sydney and University. A lot of people
had hopes that the head-play and well-know n passing
charges of the ’Varsity would overwhelm the South Syd-
neyites. But, from the start, University was outmatched,
and began early to show its skill at forcing. Its passing
charges were wrecked by vigorous tackling, and the
Southerners dribbled all over it. Play had a tendency to
roughness, and, after bandaged heads began to be con-
spicuous, a South Sydney player was ordered off the
field. The game ended in the defeat of the ’Varsity by
15 to 8. North Sydney hill-climbers were just one point
too many for Sydney District, winning by 6 to 5. Bal-
main defeated Western Suburbs by 4 to nil, after a game
which was neither brilliant nor humorous. The result of
the scuffle was to keep South Sydney still at the head of
the competition with 21 points. Glebe, by virtue of its
win over Eastern Suburbs, retains second place, one
point behind ; and Western Suburbs and Newtown are
neck-and-neck in the third place with 18 points each.
The pluckiest team of the crowd is that of Eastern
Suburbs. When Sydney District Club was formed it took
three-parts of the Eastern Suburbs kingdom, but the
club comes up to scratch every Saturday, and takes
things fighting. On Saturday, as there were practically
no spectators and the thing was hopeless, the Glebe and
Eastern Suburbs teams played 20 minutes spells each end.

A Maoriland sporting paper states that all
the members of the Maoriland team, who were pre-
sented with purses of sovereigns, and other cash testi-
monials, have left them with the Rugby Union secretary
with instructions to pass them back to the donors with
many regrets, etc. Of course, this action has been taken
to prevent the rigid sticklers for pure amateurism block-
ing the players in England and Wales as pros. The secre-
tary of Maoriland Rugby Union is not generally a fool,
and he will presumably let the purses—the allegedly filled
purses —lie in the office safe till the team returns, when
the acceptance will make no odds. By which time the
cash should have been safety spent.

The action of those Maoriland Rugybites who,
before steaming for England, requested the Rugby Union
secretary to return all donations to the givers, recalls a
warden on the West Coast of the same country. A big
question came on for his decision between a wealthy com-
pany and a number of small quartz-bangers. The warden
gave judgment in favor of the co., and the co. was very
grateful. A few weeks after the decision the warden re-
ceived notice that he was transferred to another district.
The co. circularised the rest of the rich mine-owners of
the field, a considerable amount was collected, and the co.
which had gained the verdict sent along its cheque for the
whole amount, “as a mark of esteem on the occasion of
your departure,” &c. The warden was shocked. It
would never do. He wrote to the co. that he hoped he
had done his duty, and that it was quite impossible for
him to accept the money they' had sent him. And he
begged to enclose his cheque for the amount. The secre-
tary’ of the co. was a man named Green, and without con-
sulting his directors he took that cheque to the bank. It
was dishonored ! And then Green felt blue, and when the
directors heard of his action they looked black, especially
a very wise old director named Brown.

Shrubb seems to have gone off since his return
to England. He did not defend the mile championship
last month, and in the four miles he stopped, thoroughly
beaten, a little over half-way. Duffey did not appear,
and the 220 was the only event won by an American.
A Frenchman took the pole jump, and the high and long,
with the weight, went to Ireland. Scotchmen scooped
the hammer, quarter, half and hurdles.

As anticipated, Kieran downed Billington
easily in the half-mile, beating the Englishman by 15yd.
The time (11.28) was slow compared to Kieran’s own
world record (11.11 3-sth), put up in Sydney on March 15
this year. Judging by the way he has crowded over
Billington in the quarter and half-miles, the 500 yd. and
220 yd. championships should fall to him easily enough.
The French champion swimmer, Burgess, who,
by the way, is really a Yorkshireman, is said to have
again tried the Channel swim, and had to give up within
11 miles of Boulogne, after swimming and drifting 29
miles in 14J hours. Burgess is a sturdily built man, and
an exceptionally powerful swimmer, who last year put up
a long and fast performance in very rough water. A
week or so ago he started from the French side, and got
within four miles of Dover in 12 hours. Further candi-
dates for the Channel Stakes are announced in Prof.
Reddish. C. M. Reyrndi, and J. Wollfe. These last two
names have a very un-bulldoggy sound.

Kieran has been making things lively in Sweden
at the international swimming meeting, extending over
four days from the 12th inst. English, German, anl
French champions were, when Monday’s English mail
left London, making arrangements to compete.
Cabled that the Australian won 100 yd. interna-
tional supremacy on Saturday in 1.10 2-5, but it
should be 100 metres (109yd.)—1.10 2-5 is not
good time for 100 yd. Also announced that Kieran,
on Sunday, appropriated 500 metres (about 550 yd).
premiership in 7.18 2-5, which is a world’s record
and remarkably fast. Same day 1609 metres (1 mile)
event also fell to Kieran in 28min. 2 1-5 sec.—considerably
short of his world’s record (23.16 4-5), but probably it was
little more than a swim over. A 6436 metres (4 miles)
scratch event was on the programme for Monday, and
that should have been a good thing for the Australian.
Kieran is now probably swimming as well as ever he did
in Australia, and only needs opportunities to show old-
world swimmers that he is what his reputation this side
of the globe makes him—the greatest racing swimmer
ever seen.
• * * •
Burgess’s latest attempt to swim across the
Channel is another illustration of the difference between
Matthew Webb and his imitators. Burgess went near to
completing the trip in two-thirds of the time that Webb
tor k, but, after 14J hours in the water, he was overpowered
by the cold, the full distance of his swim being estimated
at 29 miles. The gallant Captain of yore stayed 21} hours
in the water whilst covering 35 miles or thereabouts, and
there was still a little warmth and “go ” in him at the
finish. Webb, needless to say, was a mighty-chested
blonde man, his head hair of an almost golden
tint, and his moustache so light that it looked
white in some of his photos. All the mighty
men who combine exceptional physical and vital
strength are of the one complexion—Sandow, Hacken-
schmidt, Matthew Webb, and here in Australia, the im-
pressive Pagel, and young Weber —all fair-haired brothers
in whom there is no dyspepsia. Some of the physically-
cultured darker men are of very unhappy temperament,
and as for the black athletes, past and present, did one
of them ever achieve a great feat of muscle-eum-endur-
ance? The strongest woman Australia has ever seen was
a, blonde (one of the Frantz Family), about 15 shades
lighter than Annette Kellermann, whose color suggests her
as incapable of staying long enough in the Channel to
swim across it.

Kieran’s trainer Mitchell writes that swimmer’s
mother that the reason her son was beaten in the mile
race by Billington was that he was thrice bumped by
other swimmers and had the wind knocked out of him.
Reads like a horse-race ! And probable enough in view of
cable reports since.

It looks as if the Victorian law had a lively hope
of breaking up gambling clubs amongst ordinary citizens
when it can’t even wholly suppress two-up in prison.
The other day a healthy two-up school was discovered in
full swing in Pentridge gaol, the stakes being plugs of
tobacco, while buttons were used for tossing.

Ed. Durnan, of Toronto Bay, Canada, who
challenged Stanbury to row for the championship and
£SOO a side —in Canada !—is an amoosing cuss. He is a
nephew of the sometime mightly sculler Ned Hanlan, and
is immensely proud of the fact. His little weakness is to
throw bouquets at himself by challenging each sculler as
he comes to the front. But he never rows any of them,
although for years he has challenged each rower whose
name has flashed across the cable. The heavy silence as
to expenses, and as regards what time of the year he
would be prepared to scull, suggest that Durnan is still
playing the same old game.

If Ringrose were an Australian bowler who had
met the Englishmen in one match in this country, and
taken 13 wickets, at an average of !3'38, the public would
have shrieked for his inclusion in the test team. But the
Yorkshireman’s brilliant performance against the Aus-
tralians seems to have been treated as a fluke rather than
as evidence of a puzzling strangeness in his bowling.

Negotiations with regard to inducing the Mel-
bourne Cricket Club to come to terms with the Aus-
tralasian Board of Control have got so far that the club
offers to surrender 80 per cent, of the gross takings of the
international matches played on its ground if it be allowed
to nominate a member of the Board of Control. But
N.S.W. will certainly look askance at the idea of three
Victorians being on the Board, even though the three are
on violently hostile terms, unless N.S.W. gets similar rep-
resentation. The Sydney Cricket Ground trustees will
probably charge 20 per cent, for their ground and hand
over 80 per cent., just like the M.C.C. : so there seems no
reason to deny them the privilege of a delegate on the
Board of Control if the M.C.C. gets one. But then in
N.S.W. the Cricket Association and the Sydney Cricket
Ground trustees lead a cat-and-dog life, just as the M.C.C.
does with the Board of Control, and if all these hostile
elements get on the Board of Control, it is likely to be a
very uncontrollable Board.

The late T. F. Hamilton, pioneer pastoralist
and sportsman, of Victoria, took a prominent part in the
establishment of cricket as a pastime in the State in the
early ’so’s. He, T. W. Wills, and Hammersley were the
life and soul of the early matches against Stephenson’s
first all-England eleven. Unhappily the 18 chosen to
fight against the visitors was largely composed of more or
less corpulent Melbourne stockbrokers and auctioneers,
whose wickets fell when an English bowler looked at
them.

Jackson won the fifth test match toss on Mon-
day, and filled Australia’s cup to the brim. The ease with
which the English captain has called and tossed correctly
is worthy of a two-up player of the highest class. Per-
haps the N.S.W. Parliament will appoint a Select Com-
mittee to inquire into the matter ?

The wicket-keeping of Kelly and Newland has
been one of the disgraceful performances of the Australian
XI tour; but the high-water mark of inefficiency was
reached against Middlesex—39 sundries being allowed in
324 runs scored. In fact, “sundries” was third highest
scorer in the first innings, and fourth in the second. The
Australian team of the future will have to be almost a
new one.

Armstrong is likely to create an Australian XI
record by scoring 2000 runs and scooping in 100 wickets
for the tour. In eleven-a-side matches, up to the begin-
ing of the final test, Armstrong had piled up 1634 runs,
and taken 86 wickets. Hitherto the all-round success of
1000 runs and 100 wickets has fallen to Trumble, Palmer,
and George Giffen (three times).

Sydney lacrosse competition is now in its final
round, and on Saturday Balmain beat Marrickville by 7
goals to 2. In the beginning Marrickville attacked, but
the stick-work was faulty, and Balmain came out of its
shell, and, carrying the war into the Marrickville territory,
won rather easily. North Sydney' found Burwood in a
sleepy condition, content to play a more or less defensive
game" only'. North Sydney' was energetic, and attacked
strongly, and at half-lime had scored 6 goals to 1. Then
Burwood woke up, and there were incursions and alarums,
and the quarter ended N.S. Bto 3. That woke Burwood
right up, and it made a beautiful defence whenever N.S.
attacked, and shot 3 goals on its own account. But the
end came too soon, and found N.S. still leading by two,
and the game ended 8 to 6.

Vic. League of Wheelmen’s 25-Mile Road Race
last week was a first-class tussle between scratch starters,
R. W. Morgan and M. Ohappel. Morgan won by fractions
of a second. It was a gruelling ride, with a wind like
Lonsdale’s scorn for Australian manufactures to be con-
tended with most of the way. The time was 77min.

N.S.W. League of Wheelmen has apparently
the instincts of a rabbit vendor. Among the races
apportioned to N.S.W. body was the One Mile Inter-
national Championship of Australia. The N.S.W. League
has decided that it has no use for the fixture, and has
offered it to Victoria for the sum of £7 10s. Last .year it
hawked the same event, and managed to find a buyer. Is
the League hard up, or what?
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen has made a fool
of itself by lifting Larry Corbett’s disqualification.
Now that final daub of whitewash has been applied,
disqualification by N.S.W. League will have lost
all its terrors. Corbett was a case of which no
self-respecting body could help making a shocking
example. Barring heaving road metal in a physical sense,
Corbett could not have behaved much worse towards the
League, and he went gaily on his own course, and was
beaten in the law-courts. Then when he had played his
game, and had nothing to make by further flouting the
League, he made a pretence of bowing to that body.
The Council for many months showed a disposition to act
on common--sense lines, and this sudden reversal of form
is an intense disappointment to people who hoped to see
it do its best to keep the sport clean.

It is said of the dusky wrestlers that whereas
one of them —Buttan Singh—exudes grease from his skin,
the other—Gunga Brahm—rubs oil over his body and

Messrs. Green and Jones gave a lovely exhibi-
tion at Sydney Gaiety Club on Saturday night. The
g'entlemen are in the “ bantam ” class, and look like two
wide-awake individuals who are likely to crow very early
in the morning. Four rounds of give-and-take worked
them both up to a fine frenzy, and, at the opening of the
fifth round, they leaped at one another like cats. Each
man laid hold of the other firmly with one hand and
belted with all his heart and soul. The referee’s
voice gave out with shouting while they roughed
round the premises, and then, amidst a frightful
din, the eminent authority got into the ring and
tore them apart. Before he could get outside the
ropes they had clinched once more, and were hitting
in holts for all they were worth. Again the referee tried
to separate them, and got soundly bashed by' both
fighters. Referee and bruisers rolled up against the
ropes together, and then Jones fell down and out of the
ring. The crowd was shouting, swearing and gesticulat-
ing like a herd of crazy Dagoes. It climbed into the
ring and bashed itself cheerfully and unanimously. It
made shocking remarks on the purity of its own descent,
and called on the Creator to remove it from the face of
the earth. Several policemen transpired at this stage,
and shoo’d and pushed and hustled till the mob was back
on its seat. Then the referee declared Mr. Jones the
winner, whereat there was more noise. Nobody seemed
any the worse ; even Mr. Jones seemed to have recovered
his usual genial spirits.

At the age of 43, owing to the retirement of Jim
Jeffries from the heavyweight bruising championship of
the world and America, Bob Fitzsimmons, the freckled
ex-Maorilander, announces that he is prepared to fight
any man on the globe for the honor. So far the indica-
tions are that there is only one person likely to take up
the challenge, and that is Gus Ruhlin. Corbett is busy
piling up dollars in the theatrical industry. Sailor
Sharkey has retired to spend the money he accumulated
at the bruising business, which he says he detested ; and
Ruhlin alone is on deck. It is five years since Fitz. and
Ruhlin scrapped, when they 7 put up a wild and whirling
exhibition at Madison Square Garden, New York, and
Fitz. knocked Ruhlin out, amid tremendous excitement.
It was thought at one time that a young Knickerbocker,
Billy Rodenbach, who recently 7 won the amateur heavy-
weight championship of the States, would reach out
for the professional title too, but the fight that
gave him the amateur championship wrecked one
of the ligaments of his arm—and his fighting days
ended right there. Outside of Ruhlin, there is no one
visible at present, but the Californians offer to produce a
born champion in a year’s time, in the person of Al.
Kauffman. There seems to be a grievous lack of British
ring about the names of these prospective champions—is
the Anglo-Saxon played out ? But what sort of an
opinion must those Californians have of Fitzsimmons
when they want 12 months to get a young, new bruiser
ready to fight a man of 43 ?

“S.S.” : The Melbourne fight between Al Neil
and Ed. Williams, which drew an enormous crowd at
10s., 55., 3s. and 25., leaves behind it a smell as of dead
alligators. Pugs are always wailing over the decadence
of the game, and the unwillingness of the public to pay
to see a good go; and yet when the public does pay
liberally, it has too often to sit round and witness a
peurile spar, in which two clever boxers make a not very 7
brilliant effort to look as if they were fighting. Williams,
who had fought through Neil’s boasted guard and punished
him heavily on the occasion of their former meeting,
sparred like a cat at a feather this trip, while the experi-
enced strategist, Neil, poured in wild swings that ripped
crescents in the atmosphere. Williams, a cool-headed
fighter, all of whose Melbourne fights I have seen, without
ever discovering in him the smallest tendency to foul, at
last yanked his opponent down by the neck. It looked
like simply asking for an adverse decision on a foul, and
the referee gave it. Referees are given power to com-
mandeer the spoil for charities when the smell of dead
things is too powerful. It would be better for the sport
if they asserted their power now and again.
* # * *
“S.” : There is in Melbourne now, in rather a
bad way, an old ped. who was a sensational ground-
coverer in his day and generation. But he was so fast
that he contracted a habit of getting ahead of the public,
and he dropped out of the game as Lucifer fell. A backer
recollects that the flyer was engaged to go to Bendigo and
break the mile record to pieces. The backer w 7 ent along,
and found the ground in a beastly state in consequence of
recent rains. The ped. was not too good, either, and was
feeling like standing out, when his trainer got at him and
pitched so enthusiastic a tale about his ability to knock
lumps off the record that the sport went right out and
backed his fancy to win him £l5O. The trial came off,
and, despite the heaviness of the track, the ped. beat the
record by seconds. The backer collected; and was happy.
Two days later he was getting out of Bendigo hot-foot,
with a band of bookmakers after him, thirsting for his
money or his life. It was found that a piece had been
cut out of the middle of the tape line with which the dis-
tance was measured, and the two ends cunningly joined
again. The sport swears he was honest in the matter,
but he comments with unction on the ped.’s rare qualities
as a take-down.

At last advices the George Read who isn’t and
wasn’t the Australian Premier didn’t think much of his
chances of attempting 7 the Channel swim. The attempts
used to be financed by the papers that published reports
of the proceedings, and boomed things beforehand in the
blessed interests of circulation ; but, say's Read, so many
swimmers have made such a mess of a business that they 7
never had a hope of carrying through, that the papers
aren’t doing any more financing. And as Read hasn’t
more affluence than comes from the very modest job of
caretaking at the Broken Hill baths, he was looking hard
at the matter of expenses.

There have been many nice things done at the
Hotel Australia for the comfort of guests and their
friends, and one of the most charming and successful of
these is the dinner every Wednesday night, called Guest
Night. A sumptuously good dinner is provided at the
usual rate for the benefit of residents inviting their
friends, and for the benefit of theatre parties who are not
resident in the hotel, but who are desirous of doing thenl-
selves justice by beginning the evening in a thoroughly
enjoyable way. A good band is in attendance, so that
those who do not wish to go to the theatre after dinner
can be entertained with music till 'eleven. Needless to
say Sydney society is gratefully availing itself of such an
excellent innovation-.*
AT POVERTY POINT.
They were rehearsing a play at a certain Australian
theatre, arid one of the actors—an American—protested
that 'certain of the stage arrangements were con-
trary tri the Amurrican practice as approved by the
great riiinds of Noo Yark.” He was so assertive of his
superior knowledge that at last the stage manager said—
“ You forget that the great minds of Noo Yark are not
here, anyhow.” Then the overwhelming person, drawing
himself up as only an act-or can and touching his chest
with his right hand, replied—“ Mr. So-and-So, one of the
great minds is here.” Then the band laughed. It is very
hard for an aot-or to win respectful sympathy from the
band.
“ Skull ” : Williamson’s Repertoire Cos. gives a nice,
pleasing, easy-going sort of rendering of “The Gondo-
liers,” but an admirer familiar with Gilbert detects and
detests some vapid gagging, and misses the artful acting
of the songs. Howard Vernon alone maintains his busi-
ness. It is only hecessary to Coiriparf frank .Wilson'S
play as Guiseppe with Rvley’S - , recalling particularly the
pleasant fooling - and Vivacious dance that accompanied
the singing of “ Philosophers may Sing’of the Troubles of a
King,” to appreciate hoW much a spectator loses through
the laziness of the younger;Repertoires.
Thurston - , at Sydney palace, has some new things as
well as Some of an antique brand. That illusion where a
lady appears to float iri space was a trick of the late
Dante’s ; and the mechanist who set the same for him was
R. B. Smith, at one time a watchmaker in Oxford-street,
Sydney. Smith, who is now in America, was a most
ingenious mechanist, but he had the “ business instinct”
very weakly developed, and consequently never reaped
the benefit of his genius.
“ O’Fipp ” : Recent lamentations on a poor production
of “The School for Scandal” make one ponder whether
inferior revivals of standard plays are not better than
none. Personally, I would prefer to see George Fuller
Golden as Sir Peter and Marie Lloyd as Lady Teazle
than see nobody at all. Asa member of the “starved-
looking ” audience referred to by “ Melb.” (B. 3/8/[OS), I
managed to laugh at Sheridan’s wit, as spoken, without
undue effort, even though their parts did not fit some of
the performers too well. Talking about revivals, it seems
about time for “Othello” to be put on once more. I beg
to nominate Will Whitburn as Othello and Miss Susiri
Vaughan as Desdemona,
“ L.C.” :Re “ O.Ki*’ Oh Regina Nagel’s nervousness (B.
•3/8/’os> Dori’t think nervousness alone would account
for the failure of her European career. More probably it
was bad management, or lack of that sort of push which
gave momentum to Amy Castles. Regina seems to have
lost nerve as she gained knowledge. I heard her first in
a country hall (Sunbury, Vic.) away back in 1895, and she
hadn’t a trace of nervousness then. She seemed to sing
for pure love of it, and her response to encores was
beautifully naive in its readiness. Her voice was a noble
organ even then, all untrained as it was i and it Seems
both a miracle and a calamity that she is not now a world-
singer.
Alfred C. Bottoms, the vocalist of ascetic appearance,
whose well-trained baritone is a good ridvt-. for the
Marshall-Hall eonservatorium, . hails from the district
Which prides itself on producing, voices like those of
the GastleS girls, LOvie Mueller, Dili Sharp, arid many
other Songbirds. Bottoms first “ made sweet moan ”at
Raglehawk, a few miles from BeridigO city, For a time
he sang Under the name of Ben Digo,
Tittell Brune had a bad time With her throat in Dunedin,
and one night her under-study, Nellie Ferguson, daughter
of old Colonel D’Otsay Ogden, had to go on for an act.
The under-study was, iri point of quality, so close to the
original that a good part of the house didn’t know there
had been a change.
The old Chow Africa war enthusiasm still tries to burst
out at intervals in S.A. Adelaide Field Artillery lately
had a concert (in aid of ri gymnasium), at which the Grow-
eatirig bombardiers exhibited a cannon captured by Major
Reade rind ten other South Australians from the Boers
during the struggle to supply cheap Chinese labor to the
mines. All this was set forth with great pride ori the
programme, together with the names of the ten men who
stole the implement.
“Melb,”: Henrietta Serjeant’s interview with Carrie
Haase, in the August New Idea, is somewhat different
from the convfenti mal and perfunctory rut. Here’s how
Carrie talks “My methods are my own. I memorise,
first of all. I read over the scene, the poem, gain a
?*■<- rral c inception of what the author strove to convey,
or what I think he strove to convey. v Then, as Ijread
agairi —more carefully this time, more thoroughly—thb
deeper beauties, the more subtle meanings, the gleams - ,
dept is, something of these reveal themselves. Again and
again I study, I think, I lift away the words with the
effort of my iriihd, look at the image. I walk orit in the
early morning—oh, it is nothing for me to walk eight
lri.lei before breakfast with my book in my hand—and
th ire, alone, under trees, beneath the heavens, with no
one to disturb or intrude, I give my interpretation, I
rehearse aloud. I probe and lay bare the agonies I must
convey by my tones, my gestures ;or catch, instead, the
gleams of laughter, the flash of humor lurking behind the
veil of words.”
A pretentious Melbourne theatrical publication prints
an interview with George Friend, of Nance O’Neil’s com-
pany, in which an expectaht continent is informed that
“ that popular and promising y'diing actor” is “particu-
la-ly fond of vegetable marrow, either baked or boiled.”
Cos in try papers please copy. The same publication prints
a f .11-length portrait of Miss Nance in modern evening
dr ss with the legend, “ Miss Nance O’Neil as Queen
Elizabeth.”
There was a comedy interlude during an interval at a
big Melbourne theatre one night a week or two back.
The circle was well attended, and a row of five or six
ladies, anxious probably to draw popular attention to
their best frocks, affected to be highly amused over some-
thing or somebody in another part of the house. Their
laughter was spacious, and there was much fussing and
flurry and comparing of opinions amongst them, and over
th»"’ that air of false and toothy merriment characteristic
of the 'ex when it thinks it is giving a younger and nicer
v oman a bad time. Suddenly a very stout, rather bare
Ec rson, who was leading the cachinnation, jerked herself
ack from a paroxysm that had brought her well over
the pmsh-colored rail, with something very like a scream.
She muffled the lower part of her face hastily in a lace
wrap, and her party stiffened as if stricken into so many
pillars of salt. But there was no hiding the terrible truth.
The fat merry-maker had dropped her false teeth into the
stalls, and the full set hung, in the sight of half a hundred
people, glistening in the dark hair of an indignant young
lady below.
“Thistle Anderson ’’ Fisher, who complained so bitterly
of the slowness of Adelaide, is at last experiencing some
excitement. Recently she had her arm broken in a
vehicle accident. Adelaide is a devil of a place when it
wakes up.
David Svme is building the grand new “Melbourne
Mansions,”in Collins-street East. The site had been a
waste from time immemorial. Brough and Bouci-
cault proposed to build a theatre there, in boom time.
A magnificent new theatre was then projected on
the south-west corner of Bourke and Russell streets. A
Smith-street (Collingwood) shop is on foundations laid
half a century ago for a theatre. Snow’s drapery ware-
house, Ballarat, is the old Theatre Royal. The Geelong
Theatre Royal became a brewery, then Salvation Army
barracks.
Cassedl’s Magazine states that a highly valuable oil
portrait of Master Betty, probably by Hoppner or Rom-
ney, has just been found in Australia, and sent to London
as the best extant. Betty, the English Roscius, made a
wild furore on the stage when only 12 years old. He was
fired by seeing Mrs. Siddons, in Dublin. Immediately he
took Ireland by storm. It was the same in Edinburgh.
In London he reached his climax, with £IOO a night,
appearing alternately at Drury Lane and Covent Garden.
Yet he grew up into an indifferent actor.
Some of Williamson’s opera girls tripped to Sandgate
one aft rnoon during their visit to Brisbane. With a few
male acquaintances they went boating there, but an in-
considerate tide went down, and when they returned
there was an appalling patch of treacherous mud between
the end of the pier and the edge of the water. Men
might have splashed through the murky patch, but
women—never. There was nothing left for them hut to
get a-straddle on the backs of the males and take their
chances. (The theatrical male is, as a rule, not robust
enough to carry a woman far in his arms.) Some local
men were chivalrous, and also became carriers. The
shrieks and the laughter during the ordeal woke the
echoes of sleepy Sandgate and aroused a camera fiend to
action. One young lady, in attempting to resent the
camera’s intrusion, took to kicking vigorously, and
although she did not bring the man of burden to his
knees, she got one foot entangled over his shoulder jus*
as the photo-operator squeezed the buib.

NO MAN SHOULD BE WEAK!
No man should suffer the loss of that Vital Element that renders life worth
man should allow himself to become less a man than Nature
intended him. No man should suffer for the sins of his youth, when there
is at hand a certain cure for his weakness, a check to his loss of strength.
Most of the Pains, most of the Weakness of Stomach, Heart, Brain, and
Nerves from which men suffer, are due to an early loss of Nature’s reserve
power through mistakes of youth. You need not suffer for this, you can
be restored. The very element which you have lost you can get back
and you may be as happy as any man that lives.
Oup ELECTRIC BELT, with special Electric Attachments will
Restore your Strength, will Check all Drains, and will
give you back the old Vigor of Youth.
We have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings of
years in useless treatments. Our Belt is easy to use ] you put it on when
you go to bed ; you feel the glowing heat from it (no sting or burn as in
old-style Belts), and you feel your nerves tingle with the new life flowing
into them. You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old

Thirty-four years ago N.S.W. had a great
deal more common-sense than it has now. A
clause in the Railway report of 1871 read
Tee whole of our rolling-stock is now manufactured in
Sydney, and, after the experience of three years, the
Government has every reason to be satisfied with the ex-
periment. The quality and cost of the stock bear favor-
able comparison with that imported from England ; and
its manufacture in the colony gives .encouragement to
some of our largest industrial establishments, affords em-
ployment to hundreds of workmen, and puts in circulation
a larg'e amount of capital which would otherwise have
found its way to England.
That was before N.S.W. began to talk about
Freetrade, and had been taught by the importers’
papers to describe everything manufactured locally
as colonial rubbish,” and before the Stinking
Fish party arose.

At the opening of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition at the new Post Office, Hobart, on Wednesday, November 2,1904,
his Excellency the Governor (Sir Gerald Strickland, K.C.M.G.) made the following eulogistic reference to Beale’s Pianos :
“ I have been deeply interested in an Australian exhibit of pianos made on the other side of the straits, which are strung
on beautiful steel castings. I refer to Beale’s Pianos. I recently had the honor to serve his Majesty the King where no
piano could be kept in tune. Here an example is given how mechanical instinct can be perfected by trade ; that here
has been produced for a sub-tropical country pianos which will certainly stand the test of the worst heat in the tropics.
I sincerely trust it will, both here and there, meet with the success it deserves.” —Verbatim Press Report.

Ida H., Laverton (W.A.), is being boomed,
but there is very little justification for it so far. Mine is
looking better at 300 ft. and 400 ft., but not a word is said
about the poor prospects at 500ft.^

Shortly. join the producers. Co. owns a 10-head mill with
modern appliances, and has developed a good deal of ore
at three levels. Two test crushings of 400 tons averaged
19dwt., which is highly satisfactory. Mine is dry, so
co. has bought the Mactavish mine, which has stacks
of water, but no gold, and is now laying down piping to
connect. Years ago Cosmopolitan bought the same water
shaft to commence crushing, and, on sinking deeper, was
itself flooded out. Co. is in 300,000 shares, and is not too
strong financially. Its reef runs east and west, which is
nearly always a bad sign in W.A.

W.A. State batteries are still treating about

ment. Nor Randalls, the first battery that decorated the
Lake View a dozen years ago—a second-hand affair—was
bought, and naturally it proved a failure, To make failure
more pronounced, water is pumped by windmill, and when
there is no wind there is no water and no crushing, This
is a typical case,

Prospects of B. H. Junction still look up, thanks
to development on Junction North boundary, where art
excellent body of ore is exposed. But the Junction will
have to sink deeper to reach it—that is. if it doesn’t

Barrier, Wyalong (N.S.W.), crushed 440 tons
ore for 480 oz. ; but the best stone is sent to Cockle Creek
for treatment. A new make of stone has been struck
100 ft. south of the shaft at 300 ft. It is pure sulphides,
which shows that this class of ore is not confined to the
Mallee Bull line. It runs from 9oz. to 20oz. gold, small,
but worth getting. Co. will soon have to think about
machinery. Golden Fleece crosscut to the eastern reef is
now in 90ft., one-half the distance. Co. is putting through
a crushing from the western reef. The Mousetrap takes
in the underlay of the Fleece eastern reef, and the two
leases will have to be worked together some day to get
the best results.

“Old Hand”: Reply from those who know
Baker’s Creek, when asked their opinion of the property,
is always the same—" The mine is all right; but the
public seems afraid of the present control, and so shares
won’t go up to their intrinsic value.” I have heard
this opinion from at least a dozen men who have known
the mine since its inception. Whilst on a trip from
Adelaide to W.A., one of these men told me he
made a substantial and regular income out of B.C.
market operations. The conviction is freely expressed
that the last 6d. call was unwarranted at the time. If
so, why was it made ? For some weeks there was some-
thing of a run on the shares ; many thousands changed
hands at from 2s. to 2s. 2d. per share. Now, at the psycho-
logical moment, we get news of a “ burst” in No. 13level,
the first, I believe, that has ever occurred in the mine.
This is probably “an act of God,” but it comes in very
conveniently for the “ push ” that plays with this stock.
Break-downs of the machinery have been seized on so
often to move the market that the Adelaide crowd must
have been delighted with the new weapon.

Carcoar (N.S.W.) is on tenterhooks, it having
been discovered that within the town boundary there
exists a deposit containing 11 per cent, of uranium. Some
local wiseacres have read that radium can be produced
from uranium, and the dons at the Sydney University
have been asked to analyse samples of the ore. Carcoar’s
anxiety as to the result is based on the fact that the price
of radium has been stated in London as £lBO,OOO an ounce;
and if there should prove to he 2cwt. of radium in the
deposit, the town will naturally find itself worth some-
thing like £600,000,000.
Manager Bryant, of the Main Leads North,
Maryborough (Vic.), has been given a £5O bonus. Well,
he deserved it, it only as compensation for the bitter
criticism to which he was subjected, and for the way in
which he pulled his mine through. All the same, the
keeping of a bullion reserve on a mine is not
the right thing, unless the shareholders know
of it, Lately the hoard mounted to 6000 z., so
a bonus of Is. was paid as well as the monthly
div. of 6d, There are whispers that Maryborough
people then did a geritle slide, for shares Went back at
price. If this is so, the only explanation lies in the doubt
Whether the ground towards the Duke United mine is
prospecting well. But Bryant won’t have it that ifc
isn’t.

Harvey Patterson, of Melbourne, apart from
being the chairman of the Broken Hill Prop., is a be-
liever in the divining rod. He flourished this belief with
great effect in the early days of the Kalgoorlie boom over
the Ivan hoe, and, later on, to balance things, took the
twig with him to Chillagoe. To keep his hand in, he
had a shot up Scarsdale way, and located the Jubilee
lode to the east of the Jubilee—or, at least, it is fair to
assume that he did. Jubilee’s readiness to grab that
Naboth’s vineyard made Patterson sit all the tighter, and
now he is rewarded by hitting good stone at 600 feet.
As he has carried on the mine pretty well single-handed,
he deserves his luck, which is more than can be said of
most men of the bandbox sort,

For tuna Hustlers, Bendigo, went to the bad late
last year, and so had to run up an overdraft against its
reserve of £2700 accumulated during a fair period
Of dividend-paying. It is rtow operating on a
Small formation north of the shaft above 420 ft,,
and, as metal values gO well, cO, got about £l3OO
iri hand after wiping oiit a debt Of £l6OO, So the
directors, in the usual Bendigo style, must needs live up
to their income and pay oUt all the profits, save £lOO, as a
div. Certainly, the old reserve. of £2700 is intact, bUt
With the work that is ahead it looks sure that the

When gettirig payable crushirigs, the* monthly
escort of the Bull-owned Victorian Al, Gaffney’s Creek
(Vic.), was magnificent. First came the force, mounted ;
next the mail coach, containing the gold, with a mine
Official armed like a Japanese-battleship ; and the rear was
brought up by d mine employee o'ri horseback, with car-
bine on hip, ready to Shoot the first wild cat met with.
What a difference now ! The expensive machinery is
silent, the mine wears such a sick dppearance that not a
shot would be fired in defence Of its good name. Oo.’s
best hope is to let in a party on tribute ; that in the past

New Dempsey’s, Gaffney’s Creek (Vie.), Inis
started to pump out the old shaft in the creek prepara-
tory to sinking a further 150 ft. Shaft was sunk years
rigo, and good stone was stoped above 150 ft.; 6dwt; stone
is said to have been left in the ends. Methods used to
get rid of the water were very primitive in those days ;
Blit present cO:, with new plant, expects no trouble.

Charters Towers’ mills treated for July 19,468

was £84,345: Calls made by 16 qo.’s, £4995 ; divs. de-;

Mills’ United,- Tovvers, got out 1568 tons for
6700 z., worth £2312 ; concentrates, £3259; residues, £790 i
total £6361 for six weeks. Co. picked orit a parcel of prill
ore from No. 7 erist level as a trial for Aldershot to treat ;
and 8 tons 18cwt:, gave a profit of £l9O 6s. 7d;, equal td
£2llos. a ton. Cost is not mentioned: This mine is re-
sponsible for booming the School Deserve, a show that
starved tributors out, and was iri liquidation for months
rifter about 10 years’ exemption ; also the East Mexican, a
S. Aus. sho\L with a donkey boiler and engine to decorate
a telescoped shaft. Likewise the B. Freehold. Last-
mentioned co. has let a contract to' dyive the No. 7
west level 100 feet towards No. Bin Mills’; distance
between the two ends is about 700 ft. Mills’ may prove
the exception, but reefs on the Towers are very erratic.
When the Queen Cross ran into its patch of stone, pru-
dence was skied, as well as scrip. Q. Central galloped
down a new shaft, and was said to be sure to bottom.
So was Q. Central Block ; ditto Vesuvius. But now you
mustn’t mention them. The Church Lands could not
miss the reef the Block and W. left right on the bound-
ary ; but it did. It will be the same with some, if not
all, of the litter that is following Mills’.
* * * *
Meeting of Brilliant Block shareholders at
Charters Towers was not the joyful gathering it was
expected to be. Mine is a low-grade show; 3414 tons
treated for six months averaged lldwt. 6gr., worth
£2 Is. 10d., resulting in a working profit of £419, or
2s. sjd. per ton mined. Preceding term saw 3891 tons of
12dwt. Bgr. stone put through for £8566, and a dividend
of £2500 was paid—the savings since 1899. Co. has a 40-
head battery and cyanide works of its own connected by
tram line. Cost of crushing is 11s. 6d. a ton for 8397 tons
put through. Directors hold out no hope of any reduction
in the cost of treatment ; and yet the mill is soliciting
1000-ton customers at Bs. per ton. The cyanide works
purchased and treated 10,770 tons of residues, averaging
3dwt. 9gr. ; profit, £634. • The works made a profit
of £l2O ; the mine a loss of £335. Yet the
chairman complimented holders on the position of the
co. The first report was cheerful reading ; regular divs.
were promised, before they were in sight; then a blank
came into No. 14 stope and upset calculations. Bulk of
tonnage treated came from 14 and 15 stopes and 16 drive.
Former shows Ift. to 3ft. of stone, and the drive, in places,
up to 10ft., rather poor, but lately improved. As Towers
co.’s go from hand to mouth, it is safe to predict a div. as
soon as funds are available. There is £2148 in hand.
* * * *
The Silent Friend Ex., a few miles out from
Charters Towers, reports 6J tons for 109 oz. A co. has
been formed, 6d. application and 6d. allotment; next day
sellers Is. 3d. The winding plant from Elliott’s Queen is
to be erected. The show is, for the moment, covered
over with a bag, as shareholders are inquisitive. Another
rich return comes from the 70-mile, 12 miles out, where
two tributors dollied 3420 z. from half a ton of stone.
» * * *
Brilliant St. George, Charters Towers, is going
at high pressure to maintain output, and is on the look-
out for more stone. The supposed Phoebe formation is
being driven on, but it is only encouraging so far. There
is Ift. of stone on the Phoebe boundary that the George
has arranged to work. Nothing new has been opened
up of late, although the show presents a bold front.
For the month, 1771 tons for 10960 z., worth £3814 ;
residues (2400 tons) gave £2367. Total, £6lBl, concen-
trates not included.
* * * *
Wallis’ D.D., Oh. Towers, started with £lossin
hand to get out a crushing ; 237 tons were put through
for 380 oz. With residues it was worth £1458, an average
of £6 3s. a ton. The credit is now given as £l4OO, so
profit apparently was £345, making costs £4 13s. 6d. a
ton.
* « * »
Phoebe, Oh; Towers, treated 295 tons for 2270 z.,
worth, with residues and concentrates, £l2BO. Mine was
feeling sick until No. 6 level disclosed a new 2ft. make of
good-looking stone that has not been tested yet. A
monkey shaft is going down from No. 5 to locate the
Brilliant reef. Generally a bad sign when they start
prospecting.
* * * *
Diamond drill in the 8.-and-Wyndham, Towers,
has located the supposed Talisman reef, consisting of a
few leaders in oft. of formation, 600 ft. below the D.D.
formation ; and work is to be continued. D.D. Gold
Mines, adjoining the 8.-and-W., found the same reef by
drilling, but hasn't shown itself anxious to test 4ft. of
“ buck ” stone.
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, last crush-
ing was the best for some years, and may mean much
for the field } 2185 tons for £5961, cyanide bullion,
£lOOO ; total for month, £6961, equal to £3 4s. 6d. a ton.
Manager Macleod is paying attention to the deep ground,
and it looks promising around No. 10 east. A Sdwt.
level, No. 7 west, shows improvement with development,
of which a deal is being done, Co. is paying for the mill
in fine style; the £BOOO to be paid shortly Will bring the
amoun t paid to £12,500, which is half the total. If last
jiionth’s returns can be maintained the lot should be paid
in eight or 10 months time.
* 4 4 *
Golderl Alexandra, a Stnall but promising
Towers’ show, has entered the div. list with a modest
3d., the first, equal to £1250. Reef varies a deal in
quality arid quantity, anything up to 2ft., but mostly
less. Cd. for half-year had four crushings, amounting
to 970 tons, for a return of £7120, equal to £7 6s. lOd,
a ton. As 437 ft, of development work was done, besides
stoping, it is to be hoped that stone came from all parts
for the last crushing-. Early iri the year co. treated 300
tons, worth £2 16s. 3d. ton ; last parcel of 314 tons
averaged £l3 Bs. lOd. Statement shows £3,176 (less
dividend) ill hand, against £l9B for the other half; So
niore divs. are promised.

. Briseis Extended, Derby (Tas.), has had its
first clean up. More fuss has been made over the
event than if the modest three directors who went
elver to see had all fathered twins. The output was
15J tons; and most people would have taken the
figures as satisfactory had not the trio thought
it their duty to pipe out a bit more gag about what is
ahead for shareholders. I*o bl >w the froth off, a little
chronological table is here' Supplied, taken, it may be
added, from the co.’s weekly reports :—April 8 : “ Sluicing
continued satisfactorily during' week ; suction down about
sft. in modern wash ; a little tin-bearing Wash cattle in on
Saturday afternoon.” May 9: “Three Shifts working
continuously; exposed ancient drift dipping underfoot;
prospects very well, with rich patches.” June
13 : “ Punt floated into new position. Further prospects
front bottom new r barge site give very satis-
factory prospects tin.’' June 30: “Shingly wash con-
tinues to carry very go'od tin as it becomes opened out;
tin accumulating satisfactorily.” Then, on .1 uly 6, Paul
Northey Sent his up-guards-and-at-’em telegram, Iri
which he Said that the second sink had beeri
opened up for over three chairis in lerigth iri
the modern wash, disclosing tiri and gold in highly
payable quantities. From April to August the co.
has beeri o'n tin-bearing- dirt, and it has turned out 15§
tons; Iri far less time the Ruby Flat has yielded 8 tons
arid paid a div. ; yet there is no shouting to the gods to
witness that, as the' drifts.sire opened up, “payable
results must follow.'’ A little less talk and a little more
tin are needed. The above dates are gikfeh td put
alongside the run, reported iri the Melbourne' dailies, of
from June 19 to August 7;
“Melb. Hunt Club hop was a bright pink show
—"not packed, but paying its way with a pinch.
The team who hockey all their spare hours away
(led by the Misses Dodd) did the decorations and
brought about a stunning effect in stag-heads,-
Crops, bridles and other riag-fixtures, amidst a
scheme of pink butterflies spread from corner to
corner of the white walls. Pink flowers with a
glowful centre were strung overhead, and these
blushing petals lent a shell pinkness to every old
face. Not a wrinkle showed. It was a great
floral scheme, and should be a hint for the private
hostess who Sometimes does a ballroom in green or
blue, and expects her jaundiced guests to cut a
dash. One day there’ll be a portable, instanta-
neous make-up devised for emergency cases, and
the smart She may then defy any lighting scheme.
“Both the Government Houses were repre-
sented at the Hunt hop. After a preliminary
whirl, horns toot-tooted and a passage was cleared
for Lady Talbot. After a good wait, the toot-
toot sounded again, and, with a wide sweep of
train and a far stretch of diamond-glitter, Lady
Northcote smiled herself forward. Then the toot
was at rest.
“ Frocking at that dance was briskly competi-
tive. Mrs. H. M. Cox scored in a delightful
apricot over which was sprinkled wattle-dust—
the powdered gold being a poetic help to the
scheme. Mrs. Jack Fisken was in a hunting rig
of great pink splendor. She had struck the hunt-
coat tone with signal accuracy. Mrs. Lachlan
Mackinnon used her own complexion (for which
thanks should be returned by a gallery weary of
gazing on borrowed roses and purchased lilies) and
lit up her inky garb with numerous bright gems
indicative of the night and its thousand eyes.
Mrs. Everard Browne was in faint dew-sprinkled
violet and high enthusiasm. Toorak had the hop
to itself. Not a dozen outsiders showed in the
pink scene.
“A star warbler, visiting these parts lately, lost
a gold plate with three smile pearls thereon.
She advertised and offered bounteous rewards,
but no finder came forward. Her state of dis-
tress has been pathetic. Her top C languished,
and her platform blandishments fall away sadly.
She was afraid to crescendo to any extent for fear
the loss might be too conspicuous. At latest, she
was about to order a fresh relay, so that she might
top C and smile in her old manner.
“ A spiritualist she-reverend, Loie Prior, has
been casting a weird spell over the spooky popu-
lace. At her Athenaeum Hall shows every seat is
occupied by pallid and absorbed hearkeners. That
active female struck ine as being a mummer
rehearsing a ghost scene. She gesticulated wildly,
and gasped and spluttered with a kind of argu-
mentative and anguished fury that was very
convincing. ‘ Stop whispering ! ’ she shouted
suddenly to the audience. ‘ Talk if you will, but
don’t whisper. The voices of the spirits fail me
when you do ! ’ Not a full breath was drawn
after this. Pallidly the audience sat while
the show lady rustled (she wore silk skirts—
the spirits obviously not objecting) about the plat-
form catching up to the spooks, and interpreting
their to the crowd. When she talked
of the morphine Spirit,she reeled in pain and acted
up to every pang with' intense earnestness; A
fine tragic performer is the Rev. Loie Prior.
“And this spiritualistic lady doesn’t fall into’
the mistake that one more or less notable Sydney
gentleman did. He used to give seances at which
spirits of the dead seized upon him and made him
speak as they willed. And his advertisements
always specified ‘ Carriages at 10.30.’ The spooks
never so seized upon him as to prevent him finish-
ing up for the carriages at 10.30.
“ The Consuls here are collaborating to form a
united body to be festive on occasions and promote
joint interests. The Yank rep., John Bray, is
doyen and promoter-in-chief of the scheme.
“An aide is looked upon as the serious adorer
of a chubby little charmer whose brilliant sister
keeps up the family reputation in the Big Smoke.
Toorak holds its breath in anxiety.
“The Deutscher Turn Yerein is breaking out
into the Mask rash. It holds a fancy whirl this
month, and high revelry is to mark it.
“The old maids in ‘Quality Street’ look like
animated bolsters tripping about a blue dimity
and chintz interior. The long, spare, waistless
garb always suggests a stuffed bolster. Respon-
sive echoes stir in the old girls of the audience at
various expressions of the wistful, manless, un-
wedded and unkissed condition of the thirties.
‘ Why, oh why ! ’ exclaims Phoebe of the ringlets,
4 does thirty seem so much older than twenty-
nine?’ And every ageing She of the audience
blinked miserably at the pathetic query,
Miss Winifred Fraser and Miss Beatrice
Day are spinstering with more or less droll
pathos from rise to drop of the curtain,
and make' changes in bolsters every now and
then, In a bridal dress Miss Fraser gets her
quaintest effect, She’s_ a fluffy, neat, noiseless,
charming girleen, looking as round-eyed and
round-cheeked and round-nlinded as a child of
two, When she dances she looks just two-and-a-
half,
“Mrs, Brough prefers a stall on first nights,
She took an absorbing view of the 4 Quality Street ’
show from the fourth row, and beheld her Robert
making a more popular hit than ever with glad
smiles. Rupert Clarke (back again) had his old
box niche. In another pen the fuzzy head of Mrs.
Norman Menzies showed out.
“A recent Hobart bridegroom had bought the
property known as 4 The Old Manse ’ for his
blissful home. The one humorous Hobart re-
porter announced that the wedded pair Were going
to live 4 at the old man's,’
“Some samples of Bananaland society have
been too obvious of late, Last year the tropic
Clime furnished this city with a picturesque
dazzler, who dazzled with much vine-leaves in her
hair, The hot State seems to export all its
Warmish representatives in winter time.
“Mr, George Turner, with his daughter, sets
Out for Monkey-land, Of all places on earth
Japan Would suggest itself as the last to
appeal to the spectacled and solemn George, who
smiles not, neither does he jest, from the opening
Unto the shutting-up of Parliament. But Miss
Turner laughs lots. She’ll get all the fun there is
in the trip,
“At a recent municipal hop, two Councillors
fought for a foothold in a first set (save the mark).
There was nothing higher than a visiting municipal
topping the opening square, but the local brethren
battled with green and yellow rage for the one
gap. The host (who was purple in the face) asked
both to withdraw. They did, and eventually had
a drink together.
“The she-flattite flaunts her Yale key openly
on her chatelaine purse chain. One smart lorgnette
dame hangs her Yale emblem of independence to
the gold stick that supports her monocle. A few
have dog-chains from which the Yale and other
keys are dangled at the side. Every woman Who
is flatting on her own seems inordinately proud of
the fact and flourishes her key obtrusively.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Recently died in England, Robert Henty,
the last of the Henty brothers, who, with their
father, reached Australia in ’29, and settled at
Portland (Vic.) in ’34.
The Tory daily press is hard put to it these
times to keep its end of the log up, and the Argus
is suffering visibly from strain. In a recent issue
it had an attack on Vic. Minister Swinburne’s
Water Bill, andon Premier Bent’s brickworks, like-
wise on the Federal Trades Union Label measure.
An account of a fierce deputation of employers
and merchants which waited on Isaacs to oppose
this last Bill was cross-headed “ A Powerful Pro-
test.” Two letters were printed cursing the White
Australia policy; and there was a sneaky little
par. in favor of allowing the importers of corn-
sacks to continue swindling the farmers by selling
underweight goods. There were also reports of
four meetings of Mrs. Barrington’s Women’s
National League, which were mainly the usual
array of the names of the bankers’, doctors’,
lawyers’, and parsons’ wives who were present.
Apparently, the old lady was getting out
of breath a bit, as there were no jibes at
either Isaacs or Lvne, without which the
paper seems incomplete. But there was a
loud, thick scream at M‘Kay’s Sunshine Har-
vester works, and a wail over the unfair way in
which the pore, friendless American Harvester
Combine (with a capital of £16,000,000) is being
treated. Also, there was an attack on the awful
proposal to encourage Australian iron manufactu-
res in N.S.W. and Tasmania. Which was pretty
fair for one day.

REMARKS:
There is no branch of medicine in which absolute keenness of diagnosis and a
thorough understanding of every detail of a case is so essential as in the treatment
of diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs.
It is now over 35 years since the Specialists of the Freeman & Wallace Institute began in various States
of the Commonwealth their particular speciality —Diseases of Men —and in that time they have operated in
Australia alone on over 8000 cases of Varicocele and Stricture. Many other minor operations they enumerate,
those for Stone in the Bladder (with or without crushing), operations for Cancerous and other diseases of the
Organs, removal of Stone in the Kidneys, Abscess (with one or both organs), removal of the Nerve for persist-
ent and incurable Neuralgia of the parts, and many other difficult and dangerous feats of Genito-Urinary
Surgery.
Their treatment as regards Varicocele by Painless, Non-cutting, Non-contracting, and Bloodless Opera-
tion is now well advanced, and generally approved of, and with that end in view they have carefully collected
and tabulated statistics of a large number of operations of this nature.
The Freeman & Wallace Medical Institute has Four Legally
Qualified Medical Men on its Operating Staff. They
are Experts in GENITO-URINARY DISEASES.
They have been operating steadily and successfully for Double and Single, Simple, and extremely
Complicated cases of Varicocele, and are proud of the ability to say with absolute truth and frankness that
they have seldom failed to cure a case, provided that the patient was a tractable one, however bad or for how
long a time it had existed.
They have operated on patients from the age of six to the age of 84 years, in some cases where the
disease has existed for 20 years.
As a Medical Institute, they can challenge any firm in the world to show so large a number of cases, or
such an unbroken line of successes.
SOME QUESTIONS ASKED.—For the benefit of some patients who keep asking the same
questions, the Specialists wish to say there is no cutting or Blood Poisoning, and absolutely no pain.
The Operation never injures the virile power; on the contrary, that power is improved, the wasting of
parts stopped, the blood circulated through healthy channels. There is no confinement in the house or bed,
and the patient can return to his home, even if distant one thousand miles, on the following day. The result
of the operation as performed by the Specialists is that the moment the pressure of coagulated blood is taken
off the organs, the small veins regain their circulatory power, and healthy circulation doubled.
Hence new life, vigor, and strength in the parts after the operation for Varicocele results.
WE CURE
Deadly Varicocele, Urinary Affections, Blood Poison, Lost
Vigor, Weakness, Bladdor Troubles, Rupture, Piles, rapidly.
It is natural for a man to desire to live his life unafflicted by disease. Not one man in ten thousand reaches his three
score years and ten without having' at some time suffered from some form of deadly disorder. Diseases that will kill insidiously
and surely the strongest man in a little time are Deadly Varicocele, General Debility, Bladder Affections, Kidney Trouble, Uric
Acid in the Blood causing Rheumatism, Cystitis, Gout, and Chalky Formation of the Joints, and other serious ailments
arising from a polluted blood system. Men who are afflicted with any form of devastating disease, which threatens permanent
physical decay, should consult the Specialists of the Institute. We"cure men in their own homes without seeing them.
After you have read these testimonies from our
patients you will no doubt consider our skill superior.

The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners are
about to have a jubilee. The first N.S.W. line!—
Sydney to Parramatta—was opened on September
26,1855, so its 50th anniversary is nearly due. The
debt on this line is also 50 years old, and in splen-
did condition ; to look at it one might think it was
incurred yesterday. Also, after 50 years, money
is still being borrowed for expenditure on this
patriarch among N.S.W. railways. Victoria, by
the way, got a year and 13 days ahead of N.S.W.,
and opened its pioneer railway on September 13,
1854. S.A. was, in a sense, four months ahead
even of Victoria, but though its pioneer railway
was finished in May, 1854, it was for some time
merely used as a horse tramway.
Thus London Truth :
The decay of the upper class and the rise of the middle
class are altogether changing the character of the House
of Commons. Until a few years ago most of the members
went to the House to amuse themselves. Lord A., Sir
Charles 8., and Mr. C. were Tories because their ancestors
had been, and they opposed every policy or measure that
was associated with the other side, whether it was for the
good of the community or the reverse. The Whigs did
the same. The members met i:i the House, gossiped,
made eloquent speeches, criticised each other, and
amused themselves generally. The middle-class element
is now the most important in the House. It does not
care for eloquent speeches, classical quotations, epigrams
and sarcasms ; it requires facts and figures. Those men
are turning the House of Commons into a board-room.
The change has driven eloquence from the House, and is
driving the idle member from it.
A letter from “Dawnie ” :
Our troubles : Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to
suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous Reid or to take
up hammers and weld our own iron goods ? We have an
unsolved problem involving 30,000 unemployed, not to
mention another 15,000 or so whom the cheerful rabbit
and the pensive hare are keeping out of the ranks of the
workless army. We have a country endowed with
immense natural resources, one man one vote, female
suffrage, and sometimes the referendum. And the best
we can do to grapple with the troubles of our workless
toilers is to start them on the land with a rabbit trap and
a lantern. Australia’s Diogenes looking for a remedy—l
mean a rabbit. The irony of it. Meanwhile the Labor
party flirts with pretty dalliance at the shrine of My Lady
Socialism—she of the many beautiful ideals, the realisa-
tion of which, under existing social conditions, is, to say
the best of it, extremely problematical, what time Protec-
tion, practical, tangible, real, the “ mailed fist ” of the
fiscal question, is shunted on to a side track and
neglected. Every fast-rising nation has permanently
adopted a Protectionist policy and has found it good.
Then why, in the name of shivering poverty, is it not
good enough for us ? Let us secure the ploughs and
harrows of Protection, and we’U reach for the harps and
haloes of Socialism when our tucker-bags are full and we
can let out our belts a hole or two.

A HEALTHY LIVER—A HEALTHY LIFE.
Professor F. H. Griffin,
M.D., wrote:
‘ ‘ I only wish every soul in the world used
Kutnow’s Powder; they would experience
great benefit. Four of my family besides
myself use it regularly.” It is a splendid
corrective for liver disorders. It is as mild
as the purest water, but as certain as the
rising of the sun. It is delightfully refresh-
ing as a health-draught, and removes the
severest headache almost instanter.
Professor i. N. Love,
M.D., wrote:
“ The great surgeon, Professor Lawson
Tait, M.D., himself a sufferer from a gouty
diathesis, was not only one of the world’s
greatest surgeons, but an able physician and
a skilful therapeutist. For years he found
Kutnow’s Powder of great value to him per-
sonally and in his practice, and this remedy
is one of the few he conspicuously endorsed
over his own signature. He realised, as all
careful, observing practitioners do, that it is
necessary to cleanse the system frequently,
to remove the debris of undigested food, and
to hasten the elimination of uric acid to
properly guard against serious disease. Kut-
now’s Powder stimulates the activities of the
bowels and kidneys. A dessert-spoonful in
a tumblerful of water taken immediately on
rising in the morning cleans out the bowels,
acts as a diluent, and flushes out the kidneys
in a most satisfactory way. Thorough
elimination is salvation, and there is no
better eliminator than Kutnow’s Powder.”
Late Professor of Clinical Medical Diseases of Children
and Hygiene, Marion-Sims College of Medicine, and
College of Physicians and Surgeons.
How to Secure Both.
How many people are there to-day in the British Isles who could
answer the greeting—“ How are you?” by saying, “Very well,
thanks ! ”
The percentage who could truthfully say, “ Very well, thanks,”
is very small, but really (with care) everyone ought to be always well.
Good health is your birthright, but, unfortunately, you have an
organ to keep in order called the liver, an unruly member.
If you have a strong, active liver, you will lead a strong, active
life, but you must keep the liver up to the mark.
If you find a difficulty with the liver, be careful to avoid drugs,
mercurial pills, and all drastic remedies —they hurt.
Adopt Kutnow’s Powder, the liver encouraging remedy ; it acts
gently, yet, nevertheless, does its work with extraordinary efficiency.
If you wish to excel in brain-work you will find a dessert-spoon-
ful of Kutnow’s Powder of immense benefit. The same applies to
every action of our daily life—work, play, sleep—no matter what
you do, if you would do it well you must keep the great organs of the
body in perfect working order. The stomach needs cleansing, the
liver stimulating, the kidneys flushing, and the bowels clearing.
Herein lies the whole secret of health, and Kutnow’s Powder does
this for you, and does it perfectly.
IMPORTANT CAUTION!
Kutnovv’s Powder is sold everywhere, but should you be shown a bottle
similar to the genuine Kutnow's Powder, bear in mind that to be
genuine every bottle must have the fac-simile signature, “S. Kutnow
and Co., Ld.,” and the registered trade-mark, “ Hirschensprung, or
Deer Leap,” on the carton and label on the bottle. This signature
and trade mark alone ensure your obtaining the
Genuine KUTNOW’S POWDER
Dr. A. A. O’Neill, M.D.,
wrote:
“ Columbia Hospital, Chicago,
“ June 10, 1904.
“It gives me pleasure to state with what
satisfaction I have used Kutnow’s Powder in
my practice. I find that it is one of the best
neutralisers, and at the same time a gentle
laxative and gastric sedative, which over-
comes the most distressing symptoms so
often remembered by patients with so much
dread. Given in small freshly made doses
every few minutes, it soon controls the
gastric distress, keeps up gentle peristalsis
and laxity, the importance of which surgeons
appreciate. “A. A. O’NEILL, M.D.”
Dr. W. R. Jones,
Professor of Medical Chemistry and Toxicology,
University College, Virginia, wrote :
“I am constantly prescribing Kutnow’s
Powder, with invariably good results. I also
use it myself in order to regulate the
inactivity of the digestive and excretory
organs. It is especially beneficial in stimu-
lating a sluggish liver, preventing biliousness
and dyspepsia, and permanently removing
the baneful effects of chronic constipation.”
Removes Liver Trouble.
“13, Acland Street, London E.,
“ August 4, 1904.
“ Sirs,—l have tried many remedies for
liver complaints, but they have done me very
little good. After the second trial of Kut-
now’s Powder I felt immense relief, so I
cannot help giving your Powder a good word.

With Wounds that discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen, that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of the power to walk.
You may have attended various hospitals and had medical
advice and been told your case is hopeless, or advised to
submit to amputation ; but do not, for I can cure you. I
don’t say perhaps, but I will. Because others have failed
it is no reason I should. Send at once for a Box of Albert s

Fis wrong to suppose that ScoTT’s

out being instantly seized with a violent
fit of sneezing. Scott’s Emulsion
acted like magic. My appetite has im-

A. Molineux, secretary to S.A. Agricultural
Bureau, is publicly warning farmers against buying pearl
millet seed (penicillaria spicata) at fancy prices. A
Melbourne firm, apparently acting for an American
agency, is advertising it as a new fodder, “introduced
into the U.S. two years ago from Africa,” with qualities
never before dreamed of. Sample packets, 2s. 6d.—and
no one buyer allowed to take more than two. The thing,
says Molineux, is an “ old and well-known fodder plant,
not more valuable nor more vigorous than sorghum,
produces abundance of seed, and can be purchased by
bushels at a very moderate price ” 1

Sydney financiers have struck a new snag in
the shape of bogus tram guards. The borrowers (of from
£5 to £10) are accurately got up.in uniforms, borrowed or
hired for the occasion, but when the first instalment is
unpaid, inquiries result in the reply that the borrowers
are not in tramway employ. One “Christian” solicitor
got eight bogus tram men on his books.

“Galvo”: What a great hold the various
American correspondence schools are getting! And
what a farce the system is! These schools profess to
teach anything, from haircutting to bridge-building, by
letter. I know of dozens of clerks and shopmen, who are
going through a course of electrical engineering, and am
at a loss to understand what they expect to gain. The
fees reach over £3O for an engineering course, and for
this sum the student receives books to the value of
perhaps £3, and innumerable printed question papers,
which he is supposed to answer and forward to America.
In 31 months or so he gets a reply, but by that time he
has lost all interest in, or forgotten what the questions
were about. It seems positively wicked that young
fellows should be deluded by artful advts. into thinking
that they can become competent engineers and draw
salaries by merely filling up examination papers. But
the business must be highly profitable to the schools.

Jamaica has found a way to protect a staple
export from the conscienceless adulterator. It has passed
a law imposing a duty of lOd. per puncheon on exported
rum, the fund thus created to be used in prosecuting, in
Britain and elsewhere, those who sell adulterated or
inferior liquor as the true Jamaica.
The Australian Vigneron suggests again the
need for a generic term for Australian wine, and proposes
“Aust” as a good title—“full Austs” for full-bodied;
Burgundies and “ light Austs” for clarets. This paper
sees no reasoy why “ Aust” shouldn’t succeed as a name
just as well as “ Port ” (from Oporto) has done.
“ Rags” from a city that appears to have some
patriotism about it : In Brisbane (and pretty generally
through Queensland) the Australian blanket has not only :
ousted the British blanket; it has also shattered the
imported blanket’s reputation. Not more than 10 per cent,
of Brisbane blanket stocks are imported goods. Every
shopkeeper is booming the Australian article, and the
public now ask for them. One drapery firm, stuck with a
large stock of English blankets, is working its dead-horse
off as Australian. One to Australia! Rugs the same
—the Marrickville people are making a slashing article.
Flannels are coming along, too. The Ipswich mill is mak-
ing as fine a worker’s flannel as there is in the world—and
I talk with 20 years’ experience. But why don’t they
brand every yard of it (as the famous Fox does with his
serges) ? Miles of inferior imported stuff is palmed off on
the public as “ Ipswich.” On the whole, the worker is
(as he ought to be) a much better Australian (and there-
fore Protectionist) than the snob. You notice this most
in connection with tweeds. It is only in the finer-tex-
tured tweeds that the word “ colonial ”is dropped. Our
snobs, who chiefly take these goods, won’t wear anything
“ colonial.”

“ O’Fipp ” : Sitting in the bar parlor of a Mel-
bourne pub., the other night, heard a man who had just
been served with a drink in the bar say to the landlady,
“Time you were closed, you know—twenty minutes to
twelve. I must report you.” It was only about 11.20, so
the landlady insisted on having the name of the alleged
inspector. As she hung on to that demand he left hur-
riedly, and before two or three men in the parlor realised
that he was a swindler who ought to be helped off the
premises, Subsequently heard that it was a trick fre-
quently tried, generally in pubs, run by women, some of
whom can be frightened into believing the clock is wrong,
and induced to tender a pound or two in consideration of
the “ inspector ” saying nothing about the matter.
A Melbourne firm is growing mushrooms in a
large, out-of-date four-storey warehouse in Carlton. All
you seem to want is a dim, religious light, a sprinkling of
suitable soil set so it will drain, plenty of moisture, and a
supply of spore or mushroom fungus—you can’t call it
seed. Mushrooms are now 4d. a lb. retail in Melbourne ;
two months ago they were 6d., and yet were so thick in
parts of Gippsland that some families round Drouin made
£2 and £3 a day out of them—6d. a lb. means 12s. to 14s.
a case to the picker. Many of the farmers actually com-
plained of the nuisance, yet were too lazy to pick the
mushrooms and send them to market.

A grocer in a poor neighborhood handles more
misery than almost any other man in the trade. It is
bitter, little, pin-pricking sorrow all the time. He is the
victim of the wholesaler, who pushes on to him odds and
ends not fit for the big shop, and generally charges extra
for the imposition. If he complains, he can go elsewhere,
but must first pay up, and, unfortunately, the small
grocer seldom can do that. Tea, sugar, spices, barley,
peas—he must sell lots of them to make an aggregate
profit of a few shillings. But it is the people he sells to
that make his flesh creep. They represent chronic dis-
tress. They pay a shilling and owe a shilling, and their
shifts to pay two shillings and owe five are ingenious and
persistent. Sickness or loss of work constantly harries.
If the grocer’s heart have one tender spot it will be found
out, and he will bleed to death through it. Men have be-
come millionaires through small groceries in poor neigh-
borhoods, but, to the credit of humanity, they are rare
exceptions. The tailor can keep his cloth and the shoe-
maker his boots, but the grocer who can shut his biscuit-
tin in the face of hungry women and kids needs nerve.
And if he doesn’t shut down his tin he’s sold out.

“Sardonyx”: Can you do anything to draw
attention to the methods of some business people who
require the services of the feminine typist and shorthand
writer ? For instance, one who runs a large city emporium
advertised for a typewriter. No less than 50 applied.
The one appointed was told to come at 9 a.m. Then she
was informed that no pay was given for the first fortnight.
This was a probation to see if she would suit. Afterwards
10s. per week would be given. Hours were from 9 a.m. to
6 30 p.m. with half-an-hour for lunch, and when busy
she would be required to come back after tea without
extra pay. Question—Would this girl have suited after
serving a fortnight for nothing? A shilling advt. would
bring another troop of applicants, then the same old game
could continue. The girl selected was over 20, and could
do a speed of 150 words shorthand, and was also speedy
with the machine. The cry is for more population, yet
see the immense value placed on the material we have
got—los. a week of 54 hours and as like as not overtime
without pay. So send your sons and daughters to
Diddleum’s Business College, that they may rise in the
world. If any candidate for the House of Representatives
wishes for women’s votes, let him take steps to form a
union which will insist that the typewriter girl will get
enough wages for 10 hours work to cover her tram fare.

BRONCHITIS and ASTHMA.
A Commercial traveller suffering in-
tensely CURED BY HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE.
Has since camped out and travelled
MUCH without contracting a cold.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,—ln 1898, I was for four years previously in
Queensland travelling' representative for a mercantile
house. Having contracted a heavy cold, I placed myself
under a medical man, and used all kinds of chemists’
prescriptions without avail. I was then staying at Hayes’
Terminus Hotel, Brisbane. The manager did all possible
for me, for which I shall always feel grateful. Mr. Duncan
Currie, at that time acting manager for the New York
Life Insurance Co., came to see me daily, and he advised
me to try your Bronchitis Cure. I was' about done for,
could not eat, or scarcely swallow ; in fact, used to nearly
suffocate a dozen times a day, suffering intensely. Guess
of my thankfulness, when Mr. Currie brought me a bottle
of your Bronchitis Cure. A few doses actually cured me.
I took another bottle away from the city with me, and
gave part of it to a young girl at Southport, and it also
saved her life. The balance I gave to Mr. T. McMillan,
Tweed River—three persons cured by your valuable
medicine. Although I have camped out and travelled
about 10,000 miles since my illness, I have not contracted
a cold since.—l am, Sir, your best well-wisher,
THOS. ROSS,
Labasa, via Suva, Fiji.
BRONCHITIS and ASTHMA.
A QUEENSLAND RESIDENT CURED BY HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
IT MADE A NEW MAN OF HIM.
NO SHORTNESS OF BREATH SINCE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir, —I had Bronchitis several
times since 1898 in Victoria, Western Australia, and here,
and had paid many pounds away in medicine ; but when I
arrived in Cairns in 1900 from Western Australia, I was
induced to try your Bronchitis Cure. I took five bottles,
and it made a new man of me. I could afterwards run a
mile or climb up and down a vertical shaft without any
feeling of shortness of breath. No medicine for Bronchitis
that I have ever taken has afforded me such relief as your
Bronchitis Cure.—Yours faithfully,
RICHARD COLLINS, Mine Manager,
Irvinebank, via Cairns, North Queensland.

with cough, for five years, and during that time got
treatment from different sources, but derived no benefit

ASTHMA—A SEVENTEEN YEARS CASE.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes : —“ After suffering from asthma for
seventeen years, and having been under a great many
different treatments without benefit, I was induced to try
Hearne’s Medicine for Asthma. After taking three
bottles of this medicine, I quite got rid of the Asthma,
and since then, which was the beginning of 1883 —fifteen
years ago—l have not had the slightest return of it. The
medicine quite cured me, and I have much pleasure in
recommending it.”
Writing again two years later, he states:—“l am
keeping very well. Never have the slightest return of
the asthma.”

Dear Mr. Hearne, —The silent workers are frequently
the most effective, and if there is anybody in Victoria
who, during the last few years, has been repeatedly
working for and singing the praises of Hearne’s Bron-
chitis Cure, it is our Mr. Phillips.
This gentleman some three years ago was recommended
to try your Bronchitis Cure by Mr. Barham, accountant,
Collins-street, and the effect that it had was so marked
that he has ever since been continually recommending it
to others.
We are glad to add this our testimony to the value of
Hearne’s most valuable Bronchitis Cure, which has eased
the sufferings of hundreds and hundreds of people even
in our own circle of acquaintances.
Believe us always to be,
Yours most faithfully,

one-half of it, which cured my cough in two or three davs.
My daughter, who had been troubled with a bad cough
for the past twelve months, then used the reriiaining half
of the medicine, and it cured her also. I think your

HE wonderful healing and soothing effects of Zam-Buk make it an ideal
remedy for Piles. With the first application the irritation and pain is
abated, and a continuation of the treatment ensures a prompt and per-
manent cure. Many past sufferers have proved this. Here is one. Mr.
H. L. Smith, a farrier, of Queenstown, Q.,
says:—“l was troubled with Piles for many
years ; in fact, I do not think I exaggerate when
I say that no man in Australia could have suffered
more than myself. I have been under two
operations, but the agonising misery returned
again. In the end I was happily induced to try
Zam-Buk Balm, and can confidently assert that
its application cured me, as I have had no
return of the Piles since using Zam-Buk. Since
then my son, Roy, who is a well-known rider
in the Towers, was thrown from his horse
against a post, and received a severe gash in
the leg. Zam-Buk was applied, and in 10
days his leg was entirely healed. I also found
Zam-Buk invaluable as a household remedy
for sunburn, chapped hands and lips, and ring-
worm, and would never be without a pot in
the house.”

The Invisible Island.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was years ago, ” said the doctor. ‘‘ I
was the only medical man in the district
then, and had to do the work of three.
One night, about ten o'clock, as I sat reading and
smoking in the room behind us, I heard rapid
footsteps on the garden-path, and, a moment after-
wards, somebody came and pounded violently at
the door. I was annoyed because I had just
thought of turning in for the night, and I opened
the door in no hospitable mood. But when I saw
who was waiting outside I led the way into the
room without a word. I knew Dick Cargill had
not come to me on a trifling errand. He was the
smartest stockman on Curraboola Station—a hard
rider, hard drinker, and hard case all round.
The boss is dying,’ he said.
“ I couldn’t believe him. I knew that Grice, of
Curraboola, was as sound as a bell. I had
examined him only a week or two before, when he
was talcing out an insurance policy on his life.
And there were no epidemics about.
“ ‘ Tell me more—tell me all about it,’ I said.
“‘Shot himself,’ replied Dick. ‘No time for
anything more now, doctor. They told me to ask
you to come at once.’
“ ‘Very well. Sit there and help yourself while
I get ready, ’ I said.
“ This didn’t take me long. I was ready to
start almost as soon as my horse was saddled. As
usual, I found that my housekeeper, who was
always afraid when I had to go any distance that
I would get lost in the bush, had filled my saddle-
bags with enough sandwiches to last me for a
week. If I had had the time to spare, I would
have insisted upon her taking them out again—l
was going on no picnic that night—but I had
reason to bless her for her thoughtfulness before I
crossed my own doorstep again.
“ As I passed through the room in which I had
left Dick Cargill I noticed that the decanter was
empty. Dick was outside, mounted and waiting
for me.
“ ‘We’ll have to ride hell-for-leather, doctor,’ he
said, ‘if we want to cross the bridge. The water
was within a foot of the planks when I came over.’
“ The river, I may tell you, was in flood at the
time. It turned out to be a record flood before it
went down. And Curraboola was on the other
side. That is to say, we had to ride about twelve
miles to the bridge, and another two miles to the
station.
* * * *
“We rode in silence. I was wondering what
could have caused Grice—a man in the prime of
life, with a, fine property, a handsome wife, and
the prettiest children in the district—to try to
make an end to himself. He was a keen sports-
man, a prominent figure at all local functions, and,
generally speaking, a man who seemed to take
more than ordinary interest in the things
of the world. Why, then, should he want
to plunge suddenly into another world of which
he knew nothing? But every man carries in his
brain his own reasons for suicide.
“ All at once Dick turned off the road into a
bridle-track. ‘ It’s no use tryin’, doctor,’ he said,
byway of explanation. ‘We can never get to
the bridge in time by the road. This track cuts
off three miles at least. And I know every inch
of it. Follow me.’
“ There was nothing else to do. Besides, I had
full confidence in Dick’s knowledge of the coun-
try. Still the travelling was far from pleasant.
What made it worse was that the moon, which
had given us some light upon our way until then,
became overclouded. I could scarcely see the
figure of the stockman in front of me. Suddenly
lie drew rein and waited till I came alongside him.
The moon shone out for a moment, and I saw by
the glare in his eyes that he was in an advanced
stage of intoxication. He must have been almost
as full of whisky as he could hold when he called
at my house. The decanter had done the rest. I
knew the beast too well to tell him what I thought
of him just then, but I could see that he guessed
what I was thinking.
‘“I don’t seem to know this country, doctor,’
he said, thickly ; ‘ the ranges appear to be turned
round the wrong way.’
“ ‘ Ride on,’ I said, sternly; ‘ a man’s life is at
“ He rode on for another five minutes or so, and
then stopped again.
“‘What now?’ I inquired, with a rasping
curse. I was very mad with Dick, and myself,
and the whole business by this time. For answer
he threw out his hand, and it was answer
enough.
“ Below us lay a shoreless sea of white fog—and
our way was through it, and under it. Even as I
sat there in the saddle staring, its ghostly tide
was rising around me. Cargill urged his horse
forward with a reckless laugh, and, in a moment,
horse and rider were swallowed utterly. In
another moment the head of my own horse disap-
peared. If it had not been for the familiar
warmth of his brave brown sides against my
knees I might have been riding on a Nightmare
to Nowhere. I couldn’t even see my hand on the
bridle-rein. If Rupert should lose his wits, all
was lost. But Rupert stepped forward and
downward delicately, like Agag. Branches of
trees, heavy with moisture, brushed clammily
across my face, and some of them clutched at me
like spectres, embodied but invisible. Once I
was nearly swept out of the saddle by the branch
of a tree that felt, as it caught me under the chin,
like the rough, hairy arm of a giant. After that
I rode with my head lying back almost upon
Rupert’s haunclies. I simply resigned the whole
business to him. He was the wiser animal on
this occasion.
“ That was the most dreadful and yet the most
fascinating ride I ever had in my life. At any
moment we might have fallen through the fog
hundreds of feet down into an abyss and anni-
hilation. I called out to Lick, but I suppose he
didn’t hear me. All sounds were smothered m
that white blanket of fog. Rupert might have
been walking in muffled shoes for all I could hear.
Suddenly he stopped, and I nearly fell over.
My first, and natural, thought was that he had
his fore feet planted on the edge of a preci-
pice. I dismounted cautiously over his tail and
found my own feet in water Then I heard Dick
breathing hard beside me. ‘ I thought I had lost
you, doctor,’ he said; ‘this sort of thing isn t

W “ AYha" do you propose, doctor?’ said Dick
who, thanks to the flask, seemed to have recovered
hl “”stly here till the fog clears away, I suppose,’
was my reply.
“ The’ words were hardly out of my mouth when
I thought I heard the sound of oars. A moment
afterwards a voice called out of the white night
“ 4 Are you ready to cross over with us, doctor?’
“ The voice seemed familiar to me in a curious,
uncanny way —as if it were a voice I had heard
long before and had forgotten.
“ 4 Who are you ? ’ I inquired.
44 4 We have come to take you to where you wish
to go,’was the reply. ,
“ 4 Don’t go, doctor —for God’s sake, don t go,
said Dick in an agonised whisper. * Look at the
“We had both dismounted, and had fastened
the bridles of our horses to saplings. Rupert had
vanished in the fog, leaving the saddle and
saddle-bags behind him. Burst the girth in his
terror, I suppose. I picked up the saddle-bags
and threw them over my shoulder. Dick’s horse
was also gone.
“ 4 Step in, doctor,’ said the voice again.
“ Dick entreated me once more not to go into
the boat. I had to drag him in by the scruff of
the neck —he was as limp as a wet rag.
“ As we got away from the bank the fog became
thinner, and, after a while, I saw that, besides
ourselves, there were two men in the boat. I asked
them where they were taking me, and the voice
I had heard before replied, respectfully enough,
4 To Mr. Grice.’ That was satisfactory, at any
rate. ,
“A moment later and the boat grounded. I
got out and Dick followed me, holding me by the
arm and shaking all over.
“ The fog by this time was as thin as gauze. I
turned around to ask for directions, but the men
who had taken us over had disappeared.
“ I walked along swearing, with the saddle-bags
over one shoulder, and Dick, who was by this
time little better than an idiot, weighing down
the other, and—came face to face with Grice !
He was looking pale, and there was a red stain
over his left ear, but otherwise he seemed much
the same as usual. A little more subdued, per-
haps, but nothing to speak of.
“‘Dammit! I thought you were in bed-
dying,’ I remarked, bitterly.
“‘So did I,’ he replied, ‘but here I am, you
“Then he laughed in a silly, thin, falsetto way
that made me think he had certainly blown his
brains out. I was extremely exasperated, but I
did not let my temper get the better of me. I
knew that the laugh would be on my side when I
sent Mr. Grice my bill for expenses incurred,
and anguish of mind, and a lost horse.
“‘Will you be kind enough, Mr. Grice, to
tell me, as near as you can calculate, where
we are?’ I remarked with elaborate politeness.
His smile was even sillier than his laugh as he
answered, ‘l’m sure I don’t know. I just found
myself here.’
‘ ‘ This was too much. Either Grice had escaped
from his bed, and was running mad, or I was mad,
‘ What do you think of him, Dick ? ’ I said. But
Dick slipped from my arm and fell in a heap on
the ground. And when I turned again Grice was
gone.
* * * *
“ I was too dog-tired to play the game of hide-
and-seek any longer, or to care for anything.
There was a tree close by, and I dragged Dick
under it, and, using my saddle-bags as a pillow,
fell asleep immediately. When I awoke in the
morning—at least, I supposed it was morning—
the same veil of mist was around us. I shook up
Dick, and he arose like a man from a trance.
“ ‘ Pull yourself together, Dick, and eat,’ I said,
handing him some sandwiches.
“ ‘ It’s no use, doctor,’ he groaned ; 4 I’m called
for.’
“ ‘ Who called for you ? ’ I inquired, pausing in
the middle of my third sandwich.
“‘ My brother,’ he said. ‘ Bill, that cut his
throat four years ago. Didn’t you recognise his
voice when he called out from the boat ? ’
“ ‘But the men who rowed us over were not
dead, Dick,’ I said, in a soothing, argumentative
tone.
“ ‘ Not dead !’ he exclaimed, bitterly. ‘ Not
dead ! Why, the very hosses knew they were
dead ! ’
“ ‘ And Mr. Grice ? ’
“ ‘Dead, too—dead as a door-nail.’
“I left Dick and set out on a tour of explora-
tion. If I were really insane it might be interest-
ing to know something about the asylum in which
I was caged. It seemed to me that I walked
miles and miles. I made landmarks, but they
never stood still. I cut a cross on a tree, and it
groaned as if I had cut its heart out. And I
never met a living soul. But all the time I heard
voices—thin, shrill parodies of familiar voices.
The only thing I discovered, for sure, was that I
was upon an island. There was water all around
me. When I got back to the place where I had
left Dick, I found him in a very bad state. ‘ Bill’s
been calling me ever since you left, doctor,’ he
said, ‘and I’ll have to go.’
“I had some bromide of potassium in my
saddle-bags, and I gave him a dose strong enough
to have sent a mad dog to sleep. I might as well
have given him water. The fear of Death was on
him. But the heart of a man was in him, for all
that. ‘Look out for yourself, doctor,’ were the
last words he said to me.
“I pulled my overcoat around my eyes and
fell asleep. And when I awoke Dick was gone.
And there were no tracks of feet or marks of a
moving body on the ground !
“I wandered around again all next day, but
saw nobody, and no means of escape from that
accursed island. When I returned to my camp
I lit a fire, more for the sake of company than
anything else, as the weather was not cold.
But the Are burnt feebly, because of the
dampness of the wood. There was a large
mound of dry grass and rubbish close
by, and I took armfuls of this and threw
them on the embers. The fire burnt well
enough then. Skulls grinned at me from the
heart of it. Two or three of them rolled oyer,
babbling flame, to my feet. I suppose that if I
had not been a doctor, and more or less accus-
tomed to skulls, I should have become a raving
lunatic. As it was, I realised that I had dese-
orated an old native burying ground, and that I
was the sole living man on a Ghost Island. This
didn’t trouble me much. It was the Voices that
troubled me. They were all around me, chatter-
ing in their thin, whistling way. After a little
time I began to distinguish them. I recognised
again the queer staccato voice of Gibson, the
bank manager, who had hanged himself the year
before; and the soft brogue of Brennan, the
schoolmaster, whose body was found in the river
with a stone around its neck. And Chambers,
the chemist, who had poisoned himself; and
Dick’s brother, who had cut his throat, and, in
fact, most of the suicides for years past. I knew
the voices of all of them. They seemed to be all
talking about me and saying I would soon join them.
At last I dropped asleep from sheer exhaustion.
When I awoke the fire was dying out, and there
was a grey dawn in the sky. As I gazed around,
I caught sight of Grice peering at me curiously
from behind a tree. I got up to speak to him, but
he disappeared.”
The doctor paused in his story and helped him-
self to a drink.
“ And what happened then ?”
“Another day of wandering, followed by another
ghastly night. The voices were drawing nearer,
and I could hear them more plainly. Dick’s
voice among the rest. That was the most fearsome
part of the affair. I felt that if I did not hold
myself together with all the strength that was in
me I should never leave that dreadful island. As
it was, I suppose I went slightly off my head.
Anyhow, I forget what happened afterwards. I
managed to keep the life in me, somehow. Then,
one morning, I awoke with the sun shining on
my face. I waded through five or six yards of
shallow water, and found myself at the place
where Dick and I had left our horses.”
“ And the island ? ”
“When I turned round, it was gone. I could
see nothing but a little shallow lagoon, with a
clump of rushes in the midst of it. We looked
for Dick’s body afterwards, but it was never
found. They told me I had been away nearly a
fortnight. As for Grice ”
The doctor flicked the ash from the end of his
cigar, and sighed.
“ Yes ; what of him ? ”
“ He died an hour after I started out to see
him.”

IS
Because Kidney Complaint can never get well of
itself, and, if neglected, ends in the Fatal
Bright's Disease, or Diabetes*
The little leak, neglected, sinks the
mighty vessel; the tiny spark, neglected,
causes the tierce conflagration; the
SEEMINGLY trifling symptom of kidney com-
plaint (such as backache, urinary disorders,
gravel, irregular action of the heart, swell-
ing of the. limbs, nervousness, languor,
headache, dizziness, cold hands and feet,
sallow complexion, &c.), leads on to the
fatal Bright’s Disease, dropsy, diabetes, and
other advanced kidney disorders.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
Should be taken at the FIRST
sign of anything wrong. * * *
They are the reliable medicine for
every disorder caused directly or indirectly
through kidney weakness or inflammation;
they drive out the uric acid that irritates the
kidney membranes and clogs the passages.
Doan’s Pills have been in use for the past
seventy-five years ; they help the kidneys
in their great blood-filtering work, and give
tone to the whole Kidney organism.

SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mrs. Dellunga, 138 Campbell-street, Surry Hills, this city
? ay ? : -T 11 ca .n strongly recommend Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
lor kidney ailment. This remedy has proved very good in my
case. I suffered with the kidneys for a long while, and used
various remedies without success until I got these pills I
suffered with severe pains in the small of my back, also with
headaches, giddiness, and flushes of blood to the head. My
eyesight was misty indeed, I could scarcely see across the
street. lam not one to give in to an illness, but try to fight
against it; however, there were some days when I would not
be able to get up. A friend of mine, who had used Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills with splendid results, urged me to try
them. At length I did get them, but only after much per-
suasion, and when I used them I derived so much benefit that
I regret I did not use them the very first time they were recom-
mended to me. Had I done so, I would have been saved a lot of
suffering. Three boxes cured me, and it is some time since I
used them, and I am still well.”
A SYDNEY MAN.
Mrs. 4.^ni^ rew -McDonald, 3 Cheltenham-street, Balmain,
says : ee y ears ago my husband was very bad with a lame
back. All the time he did no work, his back was so crippled,
.tie always reckoned that it was caused by the kidneys. He
was occasionally free from pain, but sometimes he could scarcely
get out of bed in the mornings, feeling, he would say, as if he
were gone m the loins. Mr. Smith, next door, was always
telling him to get Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and he did
get them at last. These pills did him so much good that he was
able to start work, and has been working regularly ever since.
At the worst of times he has very slight pains now, but mostly
none whatever.” J
Mrs. McDonald makes a further statement, three years later,
one says : ‘My husband never has backache now ; he was
cured three years ago, and has been quite well ever since. My
son Andrew used them with great success since I made the above
statement. He had very severe backache, and two boxes cured
him. He has had no sign of the ailment for eighteen months
now.” °

A Seashore Chanty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE’VE laid down here for a whole dam
year,
Heart sick of the whole dam thing,
A-learning keeping cool while we waited for the
wool,
And a-praying God to ’urry up the Spring;
And night and bloomin’ day, as anchored here we
lay,
The screw boats passed us merrily.
Ho ! we cursed the bleating sheep that kept us
from a peep
Of the glory of the deep blue sea.
But now she’s full of the greasy wool —
Yoho, for the salt sea blue!
We'll drink no more—we’ve finished with the shore—
We’re going home to Lilian and Loo.
We’re aching for the sting where the cold sprays
fling ;
We’re aching for the soft, sweet rain.
She’s a good ship,
Our own ship,
And the old crew taking of her out again.
Iheres a girl on the quay, and she’s weeping
bitterly
(Oh, it’s ’ard to say good-bye),
But there’s plenty lads ashore as will love her
evermore
(“Hi! ’urry ’ome, and don’t you cry ”).
It urts to treat ’em so, but of course we have to
go—
Lor' love us, they knew it had to be ;
So we re hauling on the chain, and we’re going out
again,
A-sailing on the clear blue sea.
So ! turn her nose where the ’ome trail goes —
Ahoy, for the salt sea blue !
We'll love no more — we've finished with the shore —
So ue can’t come back again to you.
We’re aching for the sting where the cold sprays
fling ;
We’re aching for the soft, sweet rain.
She's a good ship.
Our oivn ship,
And the old crew taking of her out again.

“ Elburg ” writes :
The S. A. country police-trooper is expected to do
almost everything-, from running- in the local drunk to
valuing the homesteads of non-paying Crown tenants •
but the representative of the law at Renmark has had a
task, unusual even for the S.A. force, thrown on his
hands in a casual way, just as if it were an inquest or a
neglected infant. The local paper has fallen into the
Public Trustee’s hands, and the police officer has to keep
it going until a purchaser can be found. Of course if he
lets the property run down he is neglecting his duty, and
if he saves it from deterioration, and maintains public
interest m it, by scathing articles on the subjects he
probably knows most about—the bosses of his own de-
partment—he is quite liable to get himself disliked in
influential quarters.
Tasmania.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I ALWAYS think of Tasmania as a land
of myrtle and blue gums, of tree-ferns and
foaming falls, an undulating clime of peace
and old people. It seems as if Australia was
designed for ambitious beings, and Tasmania was
added as a paradise for the hot Northerners to cool
off in. The land would be nothing but for the
moneyed mortals who visit the place. It is true
they have sheep; and in the north they have
potatoes (and dirt which weighs in with the pota-
toes) ; and in the east blue guin and eucalyptus
oil; and in the south the beautiful apple. But
these seem to be merely incidentals.
The country reminds me of a cow chewing the
cud. It seems everlastingly reflecting what it
will do next, without ever doing it. When a
person reaches a street corner he pauses, irresolute
which way to turn. That is why so many loungers
hang about the street intersections. Not that it
looks out of place—this is a land to doze in.
Everything is so lovely. There are such noble
forests of blue gum, and velvety tracts of myrtle ;
it is so gemmed with placid lakes, and streaked
with turgid streams, and noisy with roaring, foam-
ing falls. You cannot walk a few miles anywhere
without getting views which make you stand and
think, and when you drag yourself away you come
on other bits of tangled ferny foliage and scintil-
lating crystal cascades which cause you to forget
your first love. From the Anchor tin mine to
Ringarooma is a mountainous tract of country
with scenery right through, and every inlet pro-
vides as good fishing as you will find in any part
of the world. Ringarooma is called the Garden of
Eden. The forests of Tasmania rival those of
Gippsland; its cascaded gullies outclass Maori-
land s ; and what with forest and gully and ex-
tended views, you never walk a mile without
seeing something that makes you glad you are
alive.
It is very patchy in the matter of soil, like
Westralia, but with this advantage over Wes-
tralia, that its poor land is good scenery. Settle-
ment was retarded in the early days by bands of
convict bushrangers, who terrorised the farmers
into the towns ; and now there are land-owning
syndicates of even poorer morals but better legal
position who keep the people in the same place.
Ihe waterless plains of Australia are not known
In the Land of Sleep ; in fact, they get too much
ram in some parts, notably the West Coast.
Brought times in Australia bring boom times here,
lor the rest, it is the home of petrified conserva-
tism and self-satisfied ignorance. Politically, it is
where Maoriland was twenty-five years ago, when
men lost their jobs through their 'votes. Visitors
notice that the native-born is a curt, impatient
fellow. He is never in a hurry, but seems to
kid himself that he is.
My earliest impression of the country was how
old everything appeared—the old look of the
young people ; the old, steep-roofed, moss-grown,
shingled houses ; the old hoop-backed people with
hobbling gait and faces you could strike matches
on ; and even the old hills which seem to give all
their substance to feed the plains. And inside
those old domiciles there is the old-fashioned
furniture, the old style antimacassars hanging on
straight-backed chairs,' the glass-covered wax
fruit, and there are even old volumes of Dante
and Milton illustrated with wood-cuts. And my
second, and all-time impression, was the scarcity
of the aspirate. Tasmania is the most h-less
State in Australasia. This comes of the desire of
the people to be as English as possible.
All the other States hail the man with capital,
but in Tasmania he is looked on in the light of an
invader. The newcomer has a precipitous cliff of
prejudice to scale before he can obtain a foothold
as a citizen ; but if he is single, and marries into
a Tasmanian family, and then by dogged endeavor
and indomitable courage he becomes a nominee to
this board and that board, and is appointed a
J.P., there is no man so secure from misfortune
and worry the wide world over. He begets a son
who grows up in the beliefs of his father, thinking
the old manure is the best, and that the old
machine can’t be improved on, and that the old
methods of business are the most commendable.
And when it rains, the old-fashioned smock-frock
of the English rustic is still worn.
There are a few beautiful girls in Doderydom,
and there are hundreds who have narrowly escaped
being lovely. They are mostly marred by the
mouth, the kissing member protruding coarsely,
so that you forget the other really fine features in
looking at the all-too-forward lips. The women
outnumber the men in the towns —hops, apples,
tourists, and “spuds” not being sufficient to keep
the lads at home in the land of No Enterprise.
Another point about the people the visitor must
notice is the way they palliate the “taint.”
1 hey are always careful to tell you how persons
were transported for trivial offences. New South
Wales has lived down its past, and, anyway, doesn’t
care a curse how the nation began, and in Wes-
tralia. the old lags are so devoid of shame, and
will tell you so-much for a long beer, that it is not
much use trying to draw a cloak over the back
years. Hut Tasmania is like the girl whose skirt
ought to be longer; she keeps pulling it down
over her stockings with a shame for her under-
standings. Yet the convict history of the country
is not its least point of interest. Such places as
fort Arthur, and the “ Old Curiosity Shop ” at
Drowns lliver, where the gyves and manacles of
the old regime are still on view, bring more visitors
than some far lovelier pleasure resorts. Tourists
take a vast interest in the rock at Port Esperance
where 300 convicts were shot as they swam ashore
from a wrecked barque. They swam ashore to
save them lives from drowning, and they were
shot because the officers reckoned that when they
were dead they would be less likely to escape.
Ihe old convict-time officer was a logical and con-
scientmus man. It was told of one that after he
had had a convict flogged he found that it hadn’t
been done with the proper official cat. so he had
him flogged over again, using the right cat this
time.
There is a great difference between Launceston
and Hobart. . Launceston is the live town of the
two. It is said to be the best-lighted town in the
universe. Besides, it has a Gorge. They will
tell you in Launceston how “slow” the Hobart
people are, though the Derwent dwellers are none
too slow when it comes to getting your money.
Hobart is about the most quaint and lovely town
in the Southern Hemisphere. It is an old, sloth-
ful-looking place, largely composed of pubs., gum
trees, old stone walls, and bits of cemetery. There
are graveyards scattered all over it. As for the
beershops, they are more plentiful than little
grocery stores in other towns. There are three
different kinds of licence, consequently the Hobart
drinkeries are divided into “hotels,” “public
houses,” and “ dealers in wines and spirits.” The
shanties of the “dealers in W. and S.” seem to
consist in every case of a bar, a bedroom, and a
lean-to for a kitchen. The names of these pubs,
are original, or very old, I don’t know which. 1
noticed the “Man at the Wheel,” “The Steam
Hammer,” “Doctor Syntax,” and “The Ocean
Child.” I also noticed two hang-dog-looking
men standing before “ The Bright Smile.” Then
another distinctive feature of Hobart is the great
number of ketches and barges which wander to
and fro in the timber trade, or carry fruit or fire-
wood from the Huon. They don’t seem to have
much use for steamers in Hobart, almost all the
traders being small sailing craft. You would
wonder how they paid their way, but they seem
to do very well. And Hobart is very proud of its
sailing boats. Hobart people boast that many of
their barges are faster than crack yachts on the
other side. Some of them are very old ; the Royal
William was pointed out to me as the boat which
first carried the mail between Maoriland and
Tasmania in the early convict days, and it is as
staunch as ever.
Hobart is like the large old-world cities with its
destitution. You see men raking out the dirt-
bins. I heard a local doctor say that the convict
taint is still noticeable among the lower classes—
the old grandfather in a benevolent asylum, the
sons living on charity, and the grandchildren in
industrial schools. A whole family is thus a
burden on the State. Schoolmasters observe that
the children of these old convict families cannot
remember; they are always being taught the
same lessons. But the animal faculty is fully
developed, the families being larger than those of
normal persons.
There are many scenes of desolation in beautiful
Tasmania. Sometimes the steamers cannot get
round South Cape, and they turn from the big
resistless Polar waves and shelter in Research
Bay. This is the oldest Tasmanian whaling
station. There is no whaling done there now, but
a timber mill and some scattered houses along the
beach make it one of the outposts of the
world. It was an uncanny night I spent there.
A dead whale was lying alongside the wharf,
its decomposing smell coming across to us
with the wind. The odor of a dead whale
is something to carry away with you. In fact, if
you take on the contract to cut it up, its
effluvia is likely to remain with you for months.
It soaks right to the bone, and, as far as smell
goes, you might as well be a dead whale yourself.
In the night the water was phosphorescent with
sharks, their teeth gnashing as they fought like
clogs over the carcase. It seemed in keeping with
the general desolation—the dead whale, the fight-
ing sharks, and the few isolated families on the
beach.
A still lonelier place is Port Davey, the cliff-
bound inlet where the southern rollers boom, and
where, the captain said, we might escape if
wrecked could we only cling to the rocks like
limpets. Near by are the Headland Isles, where
thousands of sea birds gather. Wild, wind-swept,
and visited by sleet and snow, these dreary spots
give me the creeps. The child in the big house
drea,ds certain rooms. He steals by them with a
shudder. The lonely Poles are the haunted rooms
of the world. It seems that a black hand may
steal out and grab you. Men like to be near warm
humanity, and consequently they do not go much
to those lone and icy parts.

Why not get rid of these poisons? You can easily do it with Ayer’s Sarsa-
